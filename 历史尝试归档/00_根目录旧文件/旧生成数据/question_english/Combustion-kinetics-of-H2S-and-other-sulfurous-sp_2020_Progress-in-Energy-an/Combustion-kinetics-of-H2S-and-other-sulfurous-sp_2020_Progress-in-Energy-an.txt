Raw natural gas and crude oil contain a variety of sulfurous species such as H 2 S, COS, CS 2 , mercaptans, 
and organosulfur complexes that lead to the formation of SO 2 and other sulfurous compounds during 
combustion. The strict regulation on their emission has motivated the development of oil and gas sweet- 
ening processes, where such species are removed from fuels, and a sulfur-rich stream is generated. Many 
industries and plants such as cement industry, smelters, and power plants, involving the combustion of 
sulfur-bearing fuels, also generate gas streams rich in sulfur compounds. Such gas streams are mainly 
treated using sulfur recovery units (SRUs). To understand combustion occurring in SRUs, various studies 
on exploring the mechanism and the kinetics of sulfur-related reactions have been conducted. This review 
highlights the advancements in the kinetic models and the experiments on the combustion of sulfurous 
species and their interaction with hydrocarbons. The operational and the pilot plant data on H 2 S com- 
bustion in furnaces and the lab-scale experiments on sulfur oxidation, reduction, and sulfur-hydrocarbon 
reactions are discussed that have provided valuable data to validate combustion models. Due to the com- 
plex nature of sulfur chemistry, the quantum calculations on sulfur reactions have helped tremendously 
in improving the kinetic models. The ﬁndings of the potential energy surface studies with different spin 
multiplicities for major reactions affecting the combustion of sulfurous species such as the reactions of 
H 2 S and HS with oxidants (e.g., O 2 and SO 2 ), sulfur-hydrogen reaction leading to disulfur species, and the 
hydrocarbon-sulfur interactions leading to COS, CS 2 , mercaptan, and S-PAH formation are discussed. The 
combination of quantum calculations, reactor modeling, and experimental studies have improved our un- 
derstanding on the role of various intermediates such as disulfur species in the combustion of H 2 S that 
was not known before. The detailed models have also helped in predicting the formation of large PAHs 
in the furnace that possibly explain the carbon-sulfur complexes found in the downstream catalytic units 
and in the process optimization to reduce the sulfur production cost. The recent developments on the 
innovation utilization of acid gas to produce hydrogen or syngas, SO 2 to produce sulfur, and sulfur as an 
energy vector in thermochemical cycles for electricity generation are discussed.

1. Introduction 

Sulfur exists in organic and inorganic forms in several hydro- 
carbon fuels including crude oil, natural gas, and coal. To produce 
clean  fuels  for  various  applications  and  reduce  sulfur  emission 
during combustion, several desulfurization processes are deployed 
to  transform  the  sulfur  present  in  crude  hydrocarbon  fuels  into 
H 
2 S 
2 S and separate it in the form of acid gas (a mixture rich in H 
2 ). Acid gas also contains several other components such 
and CO 
as hydrocarbons, NH 
2 ), and car- 
3 , mercaptans, carbon disulﬁde (CS 
bonyl sulﬁde (COS) in low concentrations [1] . It poses signiﬁcant 
hazards to human health, process equipment, and the environment 
[2] . For this reason, the emissions of acid gas and its combustion 
products are strictly regulated by government agencies worldwide. 

1.1. Forms and sources of sulfurous species in industries 

The most abundant sulfurous species is hydrogen sulﬁde (H 
2 S), 
and the other frequently encountered ones in industries are mer- 
captans  (thiols),  elemental  sulfur,  and  COS  [3] .  Mercaptans  are 
4 ) with mostly 
present as low molecular weight compounds (C 
straight chains in gas, while gasoline and middle distillates contain 

1 –C 

branched  and  heavier  mercaptans  [4] .  Sulfur  dioxide  (SO 
2 )  is 
another form of sulfur compound that is produced as a byproduct 
of fossil fuel combustion (e.g., in power plants) and other chemical 
processes such as mineral processing. In order to decrease sulfur 
emissions, most of the fossil fuel processing facilities are designed 
to absorb and separate out the majority, if not all, of the sulfur 
compounds,  which  are  further  transformed  into  less  harmful  or 
economically-valued chemicals [5] . 
The  principal  source  of  H 

2 S,  COS,  and  mercaptans  is  the  by- 
product gas produced as a result of the puriﬁcation (sweetening) 
of crude natural and reﬁnery gases. Sulfur is present in complex 
forms in liquid fuels such as gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel and 
heating oils. H 
2 S is present in approximately 40% of all wells, and 
its quantity increases as the well ages [6] . Other sources include 
the decomposition of organic materials such as lignosulfonates in 
drilling ﬂuids. H 
2 S is also formed during the production of COS, 
coke, and viscose rayon, and during waste-water treatment, wood 
pulp  production  using  the  sulfate  method,  and  sulfur  extraction 
[6] .  The  three  most  signiﬁcant  industries  contributing  to  H 
2 S 
emissions in most countries have been the oil and gas, pulp and 
paper, and iron and steel industries [7] , with the largest one being 
the oil and gas reﬁneries, where hydrodesulfurization and acid gas

sweetening are used to recover the sulfur compounds. The pulping 
process utilizes sulfur compounds (such as H 
2 S and mercaptans) to 
break wood down into pulp, and some of these sulfur compounds 
that escape the process are released into the atmosphere [8] .

2 are introduced into the environment through 
the  combustion  of  fossil  fuels  and  biomass,  the  oxidation  of 
organic  material  in  soil,  and  volcanic  eruptions  [9] .  The  concen- 
tration  of  sulfur  in  most  fossil  fuels  and  biomass  is  shown  in 
Table 1 . The primary sources of SO 
2  emissions are power plants, 
reﬁneries, and smelting facilities. Fossil fuel combustion at power 
plants accounts for about 73% of total SO 
2 emissions, while other 
industrial  facilities  are  responsible  for  about  20%  of  it  in  most 
developed  countries  [10] .  Among  the  power  plants,  coal-ﬁred 
ones account for 50% of annual SO 
2  emissions, while oil burning 
ones  for  a  further  25–30%  [9] .  Compared  to  power  plants,  the 
industrial  processes  for  the  extraction  of  metals  from  ore  and 
the  combustion  of  sulfur-bearing  fuels  by  locomotives  and  large 
2 emissions [11] . Besides 
ships are considered minor sources of SO 
SO 
2 are also released from combustion processes in 
reﬁneries, power plants, mineral extraction plants, viscose process 
plant  for  rayon  production,  and  carbon  tetrachloride  production 
plants.  A  signiﬁcant  quantity  of  CS 
2  is  released  directly  to  the 
atmosphere alongside other gases from the venting and ﬂow-back 
operations during the extraction of natural gas [12] . COS and CS 
2 
are formed from the reactions of hydrocarbons with sulfur species 
during combustion under oxygen deﬁcient condition [13] , and they 
are produced in less quantities when compared to SO

1.2. Effects on environment and industrial processes and the 
regulations

It  is  a  challenge  faced  by  the  industries  and  power  plants 
to  economically  control  sulfur  emissions  to  meet  stringent  en- 
vironmental  regulations.  The  sulfur  compounds,  H 
2 , 
mercaptans, and COS, pose severe hazards to human health [14] , 
environment [2,6] and industrial process equipment [4] . They can 
transform  into  sulfates  in  air  and  cause  acid  rain  [15]  to  harm 
aquatic  life,  plants,  and  buildings.  Some  of  these  compounds, 
2 , form ﬁne particulates in air that affect our respi- 
particularly SO 
ratory system and induce asthma upon continuous exposure. CS 
2 
and COS negatively affect the quality of ozone layer by generating 
a  sulfate  aerosol  layer  in  the  stratosphere  [16] .  The  H 
2 S  fumes 
that  accompany  many  gas  processing  and  reﬁnery  operations 
represent a major health hazard. A discussion on the health effects 
depending on the concentration and the level of exposure to H 
2 S 
is given in [17] . With regards to the industrial equipment, sulfur 
compounds  promote  corrosion  in  them,  which  leads  to  stress 
cracking in steel materials [18] . H 
2 S is a source of hydrogen ions 
and it can act as a catalyst in the absorption of atomic hydrogen in 
steel, promoting sulﬁde stress cracking in high-strength steels. H

and  pollutant  emissions  from  hydrocarbon-powered  vehicles  are 
negatively affected because of these sulfur compounds [19,20] . 

In order to preserve our environment and process equipment, 
environmental  regulatory  agencies  are  promulgating  strict  regu- 
lations on the emission of sulfur compounds. Most countries are 
imposing tight regulations on the maximum allowable sulfur con- 
tent in the fuel and in the exhaust gases from chemical processing 
plants and transport vehicles in an effort to lower sulfur emissions. 
In  the  United  States,  the  allowable  sulfur  content  in  diesel  has 
changed  from  500  in  1993  to  15  ppm  in  2006  [21] .  The  United 
States Environmental Protection Agency has enacted a law mandat- 
ing oil reﬁneries to decrease the sulfur content in gasoline from 30 
to less than 10 ppm on an annual average basis [22] . Besides, the 
natural gas sales speciﬁcation in most countries requires the H 
2 S 
concentration to decrease from 20–75 (depending on the country) 
to 6 mg/m 3 in the near future [3] . Also, sulfur recovery plants are 
now required to achieve sulfur recovery eﬃciencies above 99.9% to 
2 and other toxic gases [23] . Sulfurous 
minimize the emission of SO 
gases from other sources such as ﬂare lines, relief valves, and wells 
must be captured and incinerated such that essentially all of the 
sulfur compounds are converted to SO 
2 (below its acceptable limit) 
prior to the atmospheric discharge. These stringent standards re- 
quire chemical reﬁneries to deploy reliable and cost-effective tech- 
nologies for advanced sulfur removal and eﬃcient treatment. Some 
of the developed sulfur removal technologies include hydrodesul- 
furization  (HDS),  oxidative  desulfurization,  bio-catalytic  desul- 
furization,  amine  extraction,  and  ﬂue  gas  desulfurization  (FGD). 
The  details  on  these  sulfur  removal  technologies  can  be  found 
in [17] . Among these technologies, HDS is widely adopted in the 
petroleum  industry  [22] .  In  addition  to  sulfur  content,  reﬁneries 
are faced with the challenge of managing increased levels of acid 
2 S and 
gas or sour water stripper gas that are generally lean in H 
also contain other sulfurous compounds, which must be effectively 
treated using the methods listed in the next section to safeguard 
the environment and protect human lives from this toxic gas.

2 S  and  CO 

The  separation  of  sulfur  compounds  from  crude  natural  gas 
and  liquid  petroleum  gas  streams  depends  on  the  form  they 
are  present  in  and  their  relative  concentrations.  Besides  H 
2 S 
2 ,  these  gas  streams  often  have  COS  and  mercaptans. 
and  CO 
For  large  quantities  of  H 
2 ,  the  preferred  method  for 
their separation is gas absorption using amine solution [24] . The 
commonly  used  amines  are  monoethanolamine,  diethanolamine, 
and methyldiethanolamine, and the choice of amine is related to 
the  CO 
2 S  ratio  present  in  the  gas  [24] .  A  chemical  reaction 
takes  place  between  the  acid  component  and  amine,  and  the 
process is very energy intensive. However, if only CO 
2 is present, 
instead  of  amines,  gas  treatment  with  alkali  salt  solutions  and 
Rectisol can also be conducted [25] . Other methods for CO 
2 S 
bulk removal, currently under development, are based on pressure 
swing  adsorption  (PSA)  and  membranes  [4,26] .  The  swing-type 
adsorption  processes  use  molecular  sieves  in  which  the  organic 
sulfur  is  adsorbed  at  low  temperatures.  If  the  quantities  of  CO 
2 
2 S are low ( < 200 ppm of sulfur content), other methods 
and/or H 
such as scavengers and scrubbers could preferably be applied [4] . 
2 S  and  other  sulfur  compounds,  after  separation,  must  be 
further processed to convert them into elemental sulfur or other 
inorganic and non-toxic compounds, burn them in ﬂare stacks, or 
pump  them  underground  [27] .  The  choice  of  technology  for  the 
treatment  of  acid  gas  streams  depends  on  the  concentration  of 
H 
2 S, the desired sulfur recovery eﬃciency, and the sulfur produc- 
tion capacity. If the acid gas contains very low concentrations of 
2 S  scav-

enging,  liquid  redox,  biological  oxidation,  and  Selectox  processes 
are wide preferred [17] . However, if acid gas is of better quality 
2 S), SRUs based on Claus process is 
(containing more than 35% H 
more  favorable  to  produce  sulfur  of  some  economic  value.  The 
details  of  the  above  mentioned  sulfur  recovery  technologies  are 
already discussed in [17] .

Claus  process,  shown  in  Fig.  1 ,  is  a  mature  technology  that 
is  widely  deployed  for  the  treatment  of  large  volumes  of  acid 
gas with H 
2 S concentrations ranging from 20 to 100%. It consists 
of  a  thermal  (a  furnace  and  a  heat  recovery  system)  section 
and multiple catalytic reactors. The furnace is an axis-symmetric 
chamber  with  an  in-house  refractory  lining  that  prevents  heat

loss. In the furnace, one-third of H

through  the  exothermic  reaction,  H 
2 O , 
2 S undergoes further reaction with the 
and then the unreacted H 
formed SO 
2 through the Claus re- 
action, 2 H 2 S + S O 2 (cid:2) 1 . 5 S 2 + 2 H 2 O at temperatures above 10 0 0 °C. 
The eﬄuent gas is cooled down to a temperature of 315 °C in the 
waste heat boiler (WHB) to recover thermal energy. The WHB is 
a shell-and-tube heat exchanger with gas ﬂowing on the tube-side 
in one or two passes and boiling water on the shell side. The gas is 
cooled down further in a condenser to obtain elemental sulfur in 
the liquid or solid form. Subsequently, the gas enters the catalytic 
section,  where  elemental  sulfur  is  produced  through  the  Claus 
reaction, 2 H 2 S + S O 2 (cid:2) 3 / 8 S 8 + 2 H 2 O at much lower temperatures 
(160–400  °C)  in  the  presence  of  alumina  and/or  titanium  cata- 
lysts [28] . A typical sulfur recovery eﬃciency (SRE) of 93–95% and 
96–97% is achieved with two and three catalytic sequences, respec- 
tively [23] . The gas exiting the catalytic section is further treated 
in the incinerator, where H

1.3.2. Mercaptans, CS 2 , and cos emission control 

The  chemical  and  physical  absorption  technologies  are  not 
suitable  for  the  deep  removal  of  COS  and  mercaptans  in  gas 
streams. To achieve COS and mercaptan removal with an eﬃciency 
up to 95%, a mixture of physical and chemical solvents are used 
in  processes  such  as  Sulﬁnol  (developed  by  Shell)  and  Flexsorb 
(developed by ExxonMobil) [4] . The sulfolane, used as the physical 
component in Sulﬁnol process, has a high aﬃnity for mercaptans, 
2 S, COS, 
and can act as an absorbent. An optimized removal of H 
2 ,  and  mercaptans  can  be  achieved  by  varying  the  sulfolane 
CO 

content and selecting the most favorable amine such as Flexsorb 
2  selectivity, methyldiethanolamine for moderate CO 
for high CO 
2 
2  removal  [4] .  For 
selectivity,  and  diisopropylamine  for  deep  CO 
deep removal of COS and mercaptans (above 95% removal), which 
is  required  in  the  production  of  liqueﬁed  natural  gas,  an  amine 
extraction  step  to  remove  the  H 
2 S  is  followed  by  a  mercaptan 
extraction  system  based  on  the  Merox  process  using  molecular 
sieves.  Molecular  sieves  achieve  a  very  low  concentration  of 
mercaptans in the treated gas, typically as low as 5 ppmv [30] . A 
schematic representation of Merox process is shown in Fig. 2 . 

Preferably, the raw gas is pretreated using the amine sweeten- 
ing process and Merox process in order to minimize the load on 
the molecular sieves. In cases where the gas stream contains high 
levels of COS, the amine extraction system can be expanded with 
one  or  more  mixer/settler  combinations  in  order  to  reduce  the 
COS to low levels and to reduce the processing load in the Merox 
unit [4] . Also, a caustic prewash system is commonly applied to 
2  before  feeding  the  gas  to  the  Merox  system,  since 
remove  CO 
CO 
2  can  react  with  the  caustic  solution  and  result  in  its  high 
consumption. Mercaptans react with the strong base in the caustic 
solution  to  form  a  salt,  and  a  caustic  solution  containing  mer- 
captides is regenerated by contacting it with air. The mercaptides 
in  the  caustic  solution  are  oxidized  into  disulphide  oil  (DSO)  in 
the  presence  of  a  Merox  catalyst,  and  the  DSO  is  routed  to  the 
hydrotreating process in which the disulﬁdes are hydrogenated to 
form H 
2 S, 
COS, and mercaptans is processed in SRUs.

To  achieve  sulfur  recovery  eﬃciency  up  to  99.99%  that  is 
required by SRUs to meet the environmental regulations [17] , the 
reduction of COS and CS 
2  in Claus tail gas is necessary. COS and 
CS 
2  are  known  to  account  for  about  25–50%  of  the  total  sulfur 
emissions from Claus plants [31] . This has led to the development 
and  installation  of  additional  catalytic  units  in  most  SRUs  [32] . 
Besides, downstream desulfurization processes are being deployed 
to  remove  COS  and  CS 
2  from  raw  synthesis  gas  produced  from 
the  combustion  of  hydrocarbon  fuels  to  achieve  suﬃcient  sulfur 
removal to meet the environmental regulations. These puriﬁcation 
processes  are  based  on  the  catalytic  reduction  of  COS,  CS

1.3.3. SO 2 emission control and utilization 

The approaches, widely used to reduce SO 

2  emission, involve 
2 during combustion (by using limestone 
the in-situ capturing of SO 
2  from the feed or exhaust gases 
or dolomite) [34] , removing SO 
2  to sulfuric acid [9] , wher- 
through FGD [35] , and converting SO 
2 to sulfuric acid has been 
ever feasible. While the conversion of SO 
practiced for decades, the methods for the in-situ capturing of SO 
2 
during combustion and fuel desulfurization are relatively new and 
expensive,  but  remain  quite  promising.  The  developed  technolo- 
gies for SO 
2 capture involve ﬂuidized bed combustion [36,37] and 
integrated gasiﬁcation combined cycle (IGCC) [34,38] . During the 
ﬂuidized bed combustion of the sulfur-bearing fuels, the bed ma- 
3 ), is calcined to CaO, which reacts 
terial, usually limestone (CaCO 
with SO 
2 is discharged as a 
4 , and thus, SO 
2 and air to form CaSO 
solid residue instead of leaving the combustor in the gaseous form. 
In the IGCC plants, the hot gas desulfurization is achieved through 
2 S to produce 
the use of sorbents (metal oxides) that react with H 
metal sulﬁdes, which is then followed by a sorbent regeneration 
process, where metal sulﬁdes are converted to metal oxides and 
SO 
2  is  either 
used for the production of sulfuric acid or elemental sulfur by al- 
2 /CO) in the presence 
lowing it to react with H 
of a catalyst [39] . The desulfurization of sulfur-bearing fuels prior 
to their ﬁring such as coal prewash is sometimes associated with 
the changes in the physical characteristics of the fuel [9] , resulting 
in  operational  problems.  FGD  is  important  in  the  puriﬁcation  of 
2  emissions, 
gas produced from sulfur-bearing fuels to reduce SO 
particularly in power plants. It still suffers from various issues that 
impact the cost, SO 
2  absorption eﬃciency, and energy consump- 
tion in the process [9] . Currently, only two commercially available 
FGD technology options for removing SO 
2 are widely known to be 
in operation in coal-ﬁred power plants: limestone forced oxidation 
(LSFO)-a wet FGD technology, and lime spray dryer (LSD)-a semi- 
dry FGD technology employing a spray dryer absorber (SDA) [9] . 
In wet FGD systems, the SO 
2 -containing gas is contacted with a 
liquid alkaline sorbent (typically limestone) by forcing it through 
a pool of the liquid slurry or by spraying it with the liquid. In dry 

2 .  The  tail  gas  from  the  regenerator  containing  SO 

2 S or reducing gas (H 

FGD systems, the SO 
2 -carrying gas is brought into contact with the 
alkaline sorbent in a semi-dry state using spray dryers. Most of the 
research efforts have geared towards understanding the absorption 
process  in  limestone/gypsum  to  address  the  problems  of  poor 
limestone  utilization,  particularly  in  wet  limestone/gypsum  FGD 
and  reactivity  in  scrubber  systems  [37] .  Limestone  is  pulverized 
to an average size of 5 to 20 μm to improve its utilization and 
decrease the volume of solid-waste [9] . However, the pulverization 
process consumes considerable amount of energy, which increases 
the operating cost of FGD. Therefore, to facilitate the commercial- 
ization of FGD technology, considerable research efforts need to be 
directed towards reducing energy consumption. 

In  recent  years,  the  use  of  SO 

2  as  an  oxidant  in  combustion 
processes is being explored to decrease the emission of toxic gases 
such  as  monocyclic  aromatics  (benzene,  toluene,  ethylbenzene, 
and xylenes, collectively called as BTEX), CO, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons  (PAHs),  and  soot  in  combustion  processes  and  in- 
crease the processing capacities of acid gas in Claus process plants. 
2 to hydrocarbon ﬂames 
It is shown in [40] that the addition of SO 
helps to reduce the concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons and 
2 . Both experimental [41] and 
soot through their oxidation by SO 
theoretical  studies  [42]  show  that  BTEX  oxidation  by  SO 
2  takes 
place at temperatures above 540 °C. Since the ﬂame temperature in 
most combustion processes, including Claus furnace, is well above 
this temperature, the oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO 
2 can occur, 
if favorable process conditions such as temperature and residence 
time are maintained. Further discussion on the effect of SO 
2  on 
combustion chemistry is provide in Section 3 . 

The  beneﬁts  of  using  pure  SO 

2  to  expand  Claus  capacity  has 
also been investigated [43] . The most common practice of using 
pure  oxygen  to  increase  the  capacity  of  sulfur  plants  induces 
excessive furnace temperatures (that damage furnace refractories), 
which imposes a limit on the capacity increase or necessitates the 
installation of additional equipment for temperature control. The 
use of high purity SO 
2 and oxygen mixtures as an oxidant in Claus 
furnace can assist in doubling the processing capacity of acid gas 
at  moderate  temperatures  such  that  major  process  changes  and 
additional  equipment  are  not  required  [43] .  The  Claus  reaction 
of  SO 
2 S  to  produce  sulfur  can  be  either  exothermic  or 
endothermic  depending  on  the  temperature  and  the  prevalent 
form  of  sulfur  produced  (which  depends  on  the  presence  or 
absence of a catalyst). In either case, the temperature effects are 
not signiﬁcant, when compared to the partial oxidation reaction of 

2  and  H

2 in the

furnace is removed, if SO 
2  is produced externally and is instead 
introduced  as  a  feed  stream.  Therefore,  if  no  or  low  amount  of 
air were added to the SRU feed gas and the stoichiometrically re- 
quired SO 
2 were supplied, the reaction would operate at moderate 
2 (inert gas) would be nearly absent. This will 
temperatures and N 
result in a signiﬁcant increase in the acid gas processing capacity 
of an SRU. The absence of nitrogen in feed can also signiﬁcantly 
reduce downstream equipment size and costs, and eliminate gas 
separation  and  operational  complexities.  However,  such  process 
modiﬁcation  has  not  yet  been  applied  commercially  because  of 
supply chain complexities and the need to produce pure SO 
2  by 
burning H 

2 S or sulfur with oxygen instead of air. 

2. Sulfur combustion in industrial processes 

2.1. Oil and gas processing 

Crude  oil  is  a  complex  liquid  mixture  that  contains  several 
hydrocarbons along with small portions of sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen 
and metals such as iron, nickel, copper, and vanadium, as shown 
in  Table  2  [44] .  Sulfur  content  in  crude  or  heavy  oil  generally 
varies from less than 0.05 wt% to about 10 wt%, but typically, it is 
present between 1–4 wt% [45] . 

Crude oil contains sulfur in the form of elemental sulfur, dis- 
solved H 
2 S, COS, and S-bonded hydrocarbons such as mercaptans, 
sulﬁdes,  disulﬁdes,  and  S-PAHs  (thiophenes)  [45] .  Mercaptans, 
sulﬁdes, and disulﬁdes can be cyclic and aromatic, and are mostly 
present  in  the  lighter  fractions.  Thiophenes  are  found  in  the 
heavier fractions. When combusted, the oil rich in sulfur leads to 
SO 
2  emissions.  A  recent  study  indicates  that  the  combustion  of 
sulfur-rich  fuels  in  oil  and  gas  reﬁnery  is  responsible  for  nearly 
2  emissions  (the  power  sector  and  smelters 
19%  of  the  total  SO 
2  emissions,  respectively, 
account  for  about  31%  and  10%  of  SO 
while  the  remaining  is  from  volcanic  eruptions)  [46] .  In  the  oil 
reﬁneries, the combustion of fuels rich in sulfur such as fuel oil, 
reﬁnery fuel gas, and natural gas to meet the energy requirements 
of different units such as ﬂuidized catalytic cracking units (FCCU), 
sulfur recovery units, stacks, ﬂares, and cokers contribute to SO 
2 
emissions  [47] .  In  the  FCCU,  the  coke,  deposited  on  catalysts, 
also  contains  some  sulfur,  and  their  oxidation  to  regenerate  the 
catalysts  lead  to  SO 
2  emissions.  The  low-grade  reﬁnery  fuel  oil 
contains nearly 1–2% sulfur on an average, and it is used for ﬁring 
2  emissions  from  reﬁnery 
in  large  combustors.  To  limit  the  SO 
operations,  the  amount  of  liquid  fuels  being  used  for  ﬁring  and 
their  sulfur  content  have  been  declining  over  time  [47,48] .  The 
main reﬁnery products are transportation fuels and the heavy fuels 
such  as  marine  fuel  oil/bunker  fuels.  With  the  known  harmful 
effects of sulfur emissions, sulfur from oil is removed in reﬁneries 
through HDS [45] , and the important reactions of this process are 
shown in Table 3 . RSH, R 
2  represent the generalized 
2 S, and (RS) 
mercaptans, sulﬁdes, and disulﬁdes, respectively, with R being the 
functional group. In these reactions, sulfur is separated from the 
2 S, and the gas stream containing it is sent to SRUs.

While the commercial transportation fuels have negligible sulfur 
content  due  to  the  strict  emission  regulations  for  road  vehicles, 
marine fuels are rich in sulfur (nearly 2%) [47] , whose combustion 
contribute to global SO 

2 emissions [49] .

Gas  processing  industries  essentially  deal  with  purifying 
and  processing  crude  natural  gas  to  produce  clean  natural  gas 
(methane),  natural  gas  liquids  (NGL),  liqueﬁed  petroleum  gas 
(LPG),  liqueﬁed  natural  gas  (LNG),  and  compressed  natural  gas 
(CNG)  that  meet  the  sale  speciﬁcations  [50] .  Crude  natural  gas 
from  the  well-heads  although  primarily  contains  methane,  but 
it  has  some  higher  hydrocarbons  associated  with  them  such  as 
ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. A  typical composition for 
raw natural gas is methane (60–90%), ethane, propane and butane 
2 S (0–5%), oxygen (0–0.2%), 
(0–20%), CO 
and rare gases such as helium and neon (in trace amounts). After 
2 S  is  removed  from  the  natural 
the  gas  sweetening  operation,  H 
gas along with a major portion of CO 
2 . This acid gas (a mixture 
of H 
2 ) is converted to elemental sulfur in SRUs. Thus, 
sulfur  combustion  in  natural  gas  industries  is  mainly  concerned 
with  the  combustion  of  H 
2 S  in  the  SRUs  to  produce  sulfur  that 
has  typically  a  process  eﬃciency  near  97%  [23] ,  though  it  can 
reach beyond 99% with advanced tail gas treatment units [51] . The 
remaining H 
2 , sulfur vapor, and other compounds 
of  sulfur,  reaches  the  incinerator,  where  they  are  combusted  to 
SO 
2 S 
2  before releasing to the environment. The combustion of H 
that is present in a trace quantity in puriﬁed natural gas also form 
SO 
2 in the feed preheaters, furnaces, ﬂares, and the incinerator in 
the gas processing industries [50,52] .

2.2. Power plants 

The discussion in this section is restricted to coal-based power 
plants.  In  coal,  sulfur  is  present  in  two  different  forms  namely 
organic  and  inorganic  sulfur  compounds.  Organic  sulfur  com- 
pounds are within the integral structure of coal. Similar to crude 
oil, they exist in aromatic rings or in aliphatic functional groups 
in  the  form  of  mercaptans  (RSH),  aliphatic  and  aryl  sulphides 
(RSR’),  disulphides  (RSSR’),  and  thiophenes  [53] .  Inorganic  sulfur 
is present in the form of mineral pyrite and represent the major 
sulfur fraction of coal. Sulfates may be present in coal as sulfate 
salts of metals such as calcium and iron. The sulfur content and 
the way sulfur is associated with coal (as organic, pyritic, and/or 
sulfates) are speciﬁc to the age and the location of the coal source. 
In  terms  of  different  ranks  of  coal  (anthracite,  bituminous,  and 
lignite),  the  higher  rank  coals  have  lower  proportion  of  labile 
sulfur [54–56] . The total sulfur content and distribution of sulfur 
in different ranks of coal is shown in Table 4 [55] .

During  coal  combustion,  the  organic  sulfur  is  relatively  less 
stable  and  combusts  to  form  different  sulfurous  species  such  as 
2  [55] .  These  gases  are  released  in  the 
H 
devolatilization process of coal, with H 
2 S being the most abundant 
[57] . The inorganic sulfur, present in mineral pyrites (mostly iron 
2 ),  undergoes  combustion  and  oxidation  to  magnetite 
pyrite,  FeS

2 
[57,58] .  This  process  of  inorganic  sulfur  combustion  starts  when 
coal is heated and continues till char burnout. A certain fraction 
of organic sulfur, trapped within coal, is also released during this 
phase  [59] .  Because  of  the  melting  of  mineral  pyrite  occurring 
in  conjunction  with  sulfur  combustion,  corrosion  on  the  surface 
of the coal combustion equipment (boiler) is likely [57] . At high 
temperature ( > 10 0 0 °C) and oxygen rich conditions, H 
2 S is con- 
verted  to  SO 
2 .  At  relatively  low  temperatures,  equilibrium  shifts 
3  [60]  through  the  reaction, 
towards  the  oxidation  of  SO 
3 ( + M )  or  through  the  formation  of  an  interme- 
SO 
2 ( + M ) 
diate,  HOSO 
and HOSO 
2 oxidation 
is  catalyzed  by  iron  oxide  present  in  the  ﬂy  ash  [61] ,  and  this 
equilibrium  controlled  reaction  is  exothermic.  Thus,  as  the  tem- 
perature is increased, the reaction moves in the reverse direction 
and  the  concentration  of  SO 
3  decreases  [57,58] .  The  conversion 
eﬃciency  of  SO 
3  depends  upon  different  factors  such  as 
the  amount  of  sulfur  in coal,  the  oxygen  concentration, and  the 
amount  of  catalyst,  and  it  varies  between  1–5%,  with  about  1% 
for  air-ﬁred  coal  combustion  plants  and  up  to  5%  for  oxy-ﬁred 
ones  [62] .  Some  reported  SO 
3  concentrations  show  40  ppm  for 
air-ﬁred and 180 ppm for oxy-ﬁred ones [63] . This trend is true 
across  different  coal  combustion  setups  such  as  pulverized  coal 
(PC) ﬁred boilers and circulating ﬂuidized bed boilers (CFB) [63] . 
Coals also contain alkali and alkaline earth metals that form their 
oxides within the coal ash during coal combustion. These lead to 
sulfur  retention  (sulfur  capturing)  reactions  by  absorbing  sulfur 
species [61,64] . Calcium is an important metal in this regard and 
this  phenomenon  is  of  prominence  in  highly  reactive  and  high 
calcium  content  coals  like  lignite.  Both  SO 
3  react  with 
calcium oxide to form calcium sulfates [57] through the reactions, 
CaO + SO 
SO 

2 is a major sulfur species found in the ﬂue gas from air-ﬁred 
coal  power  plants,  and  the  concentrations  of  other  species  such 
as H 
3 , and COS are usually very less [57] . In oxy-fuel con- 
ditions, the mechanisms for the formation of these sulfur species 
2 concentration in the ﬂue gas is higher 
remain the same, but SO 
because  of  the  replacement  of  nitrogen  with  recycled  ﬂue  gas 
resulting in the accumulation effect of SO 
2 emission 
in  terms  of  speciﬁc  mass  per  unit  energy  supplied  is  lower  in 
oxy-fuel  conditions  because  of  the  reduced  mass  ﬂow  (in  the 
absence of nitrogen) and reduced formation of ash [57] . The high 
concentration of SO 
2 inhibits the decomposition of sulfates during 
retention reaction that increases the desulfurization eﬃciency dur- 
2 level leads to 
ing oxy-fuel conditions [65] . However, the high SO 
higher concentrations of other sulfurous species namely H 
2 S and 
3  (in comparison to normal air-ﬁred plants) [57] , and the risk 
SO 
of corrosion (because of the possibility of sulfuric acid formation) 
is higher in wet recycling mode because of elevated water vapor 
3 levels [66] . Considering the emissions from power plants, 
and SO 
SO 
2  concentration  in  the  ﬂue  gas  happens  to  be  within  0.1–0.3 
vol%.  Even  for  coal,  which  has  about  3  wt%  sulfur  in  coal,  the 
concentration of SO x in the ﬂue gas remains below 0.2 vol% [67] . 
For such low concentrations of SO 
2 in the ﬂue gas, it is economical 
2 (for example, by using limestone in a 
to use FGD to eliminate SO 
2 to form gypsum), as setting up a plant 
scrubber to react with SO

2.3. Metallurgical and cement industries 

2.3.1. Ferrous and nonferrous smelters 

Ferrous  and  nonferrous  (such  as  copper,  nickel,  zinc,  lead, 
aluminum, and cobalt) metal sulﬁde ores contain signiﬁcant por- 
tions  of  sulfur.  In  the  pyrometallurgical  ferrous  and  non-ferrous 
smelters, sulfur is converted to SO 
2 in the roasting stage. Table 5 
shows  the  typical  compositions  of  the  chief  ores  of  ferrous  and 
non-ferrous  metals.  Table  6  gives  the  overall  roasting  chemical 
reactions  occurring  in  different  smelters.  Roasting  is  an  impor- 
tant  stage  in  the  smelting  process  where  large  quantities  of  air, 
sometimes  enriched  with  oxygen,  is  brought  into  contact  with 
sulﬁde mineral concentrate (cleaned form of ore). This stage (apart 
from  sulfuric  acid  manufacturing)  is  the  most  signiﬁcant  step 
involving sulfur combustion, and leads to high SO 
2 emission from 
metallurgical  plants  [68] .  In  this,  oxygen  combines  with  sulfur 
to  form  SO 
2 ,  whereas  the  metals  form  metal  oxides  and  metal 
sulfates.  The  extent  of  sulfur  removal  from  mineral  concentrate 
largely depends upon the quantity of air supply and the aﬃnity 
of minerals towards sulfur or oxygen [69] . For instance, iron sul- 
ﬁdes can be completely oxidized because iron has high reactivity 
towards oxygen, whereas copper minerals may still contain some 
sulfur in the form of sulﬁdes or sulfates after the roasting process 
because of the higher aﬃnity of copper for sulfur than oxygen. 

The waste gas from roasting furnaces contains a high amount 
of SO 
2 . For example, when roasting in air, the waste gas contains 
about 10–13 vol% SO 
2  and 1 vol% oxygen in case of pyrites, and 
2 and 5–6 vol% oxygen in case of non-ferrous 
about 9–11 vol% SO 
metals like zinc [70] . The use of oxygen-enriched air can substan- 
tially reduce the waste gas generation, and consequently, increase 
the  SO 
2  concentration.  Thus,  contrary  to  the  power  plants,  the 
ﬂue  gas  streams  in  metallurgical  industries  contain  signiﬁcantly 
2 .  The  smelters  are  strongly  governed 
high  concentration  of  SO 
2  from the waste gas. 
and require ways to eﬃciently separate SO 
The most conventional and widespread method of processing SO 
2 
is to utilize it in manufacturing sulfuric acid (detailed below) or 
2 .  However,  before  this,  the  waste  gas  from  roasting  is 
liquid  SO

subjected to dry cleansing (to remove dust particles and fumes) 
and wet cleansing methods (scrubbing-based methods to remove 
2 , and 
and separate the volatiles and other impurities like CO, CO 
hydrocarbons) [70] . 

For  sulfuric  acid,  the  required  SO 

Apart  from  roasting,  the  metallurgical  processes  related  to 
copper, aluminum, an cobalt also lead to SO 
2 emission in varying 
amounts  depending  upon  the  type  of  operation  [68] .  The  emis- 
sions from these operations are signiﬁcantly less in comparison to 
the roasting and sulfuric acid manufacturing processes. In copper 
industries, SO 
2 is emitted in the concentrate drying stage, mainly 
because of the fuel used in the furnace [68] . In the primary reﬁn- 
ing stages, SO 
2 is emitted, since the blister copper contains about 
0.03 – 1% sulfur [68] . In aluminum industries, due to the fuel used 
in the heating operations, SO 
2 emission is in range of 0.5 to 2 kg 
per tonne of aluminum produced (based on the fuel used) [68] . In 
the grinding and leaching operations in cobalt industries, there is 
2 emissions per tonne of metal produced [68] . 
about 0.01 kg of SO 
2  is  obtained  either 
from  the  roasting  of  sulﬁde  ores  or  by  burning  sulfur, 
2 ,  (cid:2)H =  −297  kJ/mol  [70] .  The  gas 
S(rhombic)  +  O 
from combustion furnace in a typical sulfuric acid plant (double 
absorption plants) operating at stoichiometric conditions contains 
3 in the presence of air 
10–12 vol% SO 
using a series of catalyst beds with intercoolers, and ﬁnally, SO 
3 
reacts with water to produce sulfuric acid. In some cases, sulfu- 
ric  acid  is  also  manufactured  by  direct  decomposition  (heating) 
of  heavily  diluted  and  contaminated  sulfuric  acid  at  80 0–130 0 
°C  in  oxidizing  environment  through  the  endothermic  reaction, 
H 
2  is  then 
used  to  produce  sulfuric  acid.  Since  high  energy  is  required  to 
heat the spent acid, it is made sure that at least 60% of sulfuric 
acid is present in the feed (impure sulfuric acid) and the concen- 
tration of produced SO 
2 is above 4 vol% to make the sulfuric acid 
production economically feasible.

2.3.2. Cement industry 

SO x formation in cement industries occur during the combus- 
tion of raw feed and the fuel in the heaters. Cement manufacturing 
can  be  divided  into  different  sections  namely  milling  (raw  mill 
section), preheating, calcination, and kiln. Sulfur is present in the 
raw feed as metal sulﬁdes, organic sulfur compounds, sulfates and 
very  rarely,  elemental  sulfur.  The  metal  sulﬁdes  are  in  the  form 
of  iron sulﬁdes  (pyrites),  and sulfates  are  mostly  in the  form  of 
calcium  sulfates  (gypsum  and  calcium  sulfate  anhydrite).  In  the 
preheater section, the organic sulfurous material and pyrite from 
2 at temperatures of 30 0–60 0 
the raw feed are oxidized yielding SO 
°C [71] . The other source of SO x formation is the burning of fuels 
in the calcination and the kiln sections. Sulfur in the fuel combusts 
in the same way as the sulﬁdes in the feed to form SO 
2 . Table 7 
gives the list of the typical reactions in a cement manufacturing 
process involving sulfur species in different sections. 

2  formation.  The  SO 

In  the  calcination  section,  the  combustion  of  calciner  fuels 
containing  sulfur  results  in  SO 
2  from  fuel 
combustion combines with the calcined lime (CaO) in a sulfation 
reaction  to  form  calcium  sulfate.  The  high  temperature  in  the 
calcination  section  favors  this  reaction,  and  the  sulfur  capture 
eﬃciency is nearly 100%. Sulfation may occur through the forma- 
3  (temperature < 850 °C) or through the conversion 
tion of CaSO 
3  (temperature  >  850  °C)  based  on  the  reaction 
of  SO 
conditions,  limestone  properties,  and  other  impurities  (such  as 
2  and  water)  [72] .  Calcium  sulfate,  formed  in  the  calcination 
CO 
section,  is  incorporated  into  the  hot  meal  (calcined  lime  along 
with  silica)  that  enters  the  rotary  kiln  section,  and  is  gradually 
heated in stages. Due to the high temperature in the kiln, alkali 
oxides,  if  present  in  the  hot  meal,  also  form  sulfates.  Sulfates, 
along with calcium and alkali, form a liquid phase that is known

as sulfate melt at about 1200 °C in the kiln [73] . In the burning 
zone of the kiln (with temperature near 1450 °C), sulfur present 
in the fuel is oxidized to SO 
2  [74] . Additionally, the evaporation 
of liquid sulfate takes place, and alkali sulfates are transported to 
gaseous phase along the kiln with dusts and other hot combustion 
gases [74] . Because of relatively lower temperatures at the other 
end of the kiln, alkali sulfates condense and eventually form the 
sulfate  melt.  These  sulfate  melts  promote  clinker  formation  and 
act as ﬂuxing agents by signiﬁcantly increasing the rate of reaction 
of calcium silicates. The amount of sulfur, alkali, and chlorine in 
the kiln and calcination section must be monitored and disposed 
responsibly, as their build-up in the system causes clogging. 

Ordinarily,  in  cement  industries,  most  of  the  SO x  formed  is 
re-absorbed  into  the  system  within  the  raw  mill  and  preheater 
sections.  Thus,  its  emissions  is  almost  exclusively  restricted  to 
the  exhausts  from  the  raw  mill  section  and  the  upper  stages 
of  the  preheater  [75] .  The  exhaust  gas  leaving  the  preheater  is, 
sometimes, used for drying the raw material (in a raw meal mill) 
and in this process, some portion of SO 
2 from the exhaust gas is 
captured (absorbed) by the limestone in the raw feed [74] . It is 
estimated that about 10–65% of feed sulfurous material entering 
2 [76] . Cement plants using 
the preheater section moves out as SO 
2 emissions near 10 mg/m 3 , 
low sulﬁde materials as feed have SO 
and  those  with  high  sulﬁde  content  have  about  3500  mg/m 3  of 
SO 

2 emission [75] . 
Different waste-derived fuels such as petroleum coke, sewage 
sludge (from wastewater plants), used tires, and meat and bone 
meal  fuel  are  also  burnt  in  cement  industries.  Petroleum  coke 
has  much  higher  sulfur  content  than  conventional  coal,  thereby 
having higher SO x  emissions [77] .  Sewage sludge  and used  tires 
are  known  to  have  almost  comparable  sulfur  content  as  that  of 
conventional  coal,  and  thus,  have  similar  SO x  emissions  as  coal 
[77] . Meat and bone meal fuel may form less SO x because of high 
calcium  content  in  them  that  serves  to  retain  sulfur  as  calcium 
sulphate [77] . Before any waste derived fuel could be used within

cement  operations,  several  other  factors  such  as  energy,  ash, 
volatile matter, NO x , and CO emissions are checked [77] . 

Thus, SO 

2 is the principal sulfur species resulting from cement 
3  is 
operations  (raw  meal  mill  and  preheater  sections)  [78] .  SO 
usually present in very less quantities because SO 
2 oxidation is a 
slow and equilibrium-controlled reaction [78] . When water vapor 
is present in cement operations, SO 
3 quickly combines with water 
to  form  sulfuric  acid  mist.  Ammonium  sulfates  are  often  found 
in  the  stacks  of  cement  industries  [78] .  These  are  formed  from 
the reactions of SO x with water vapor and ammonia. Ammonium 
sulfates  occur  in  the  form  of  very  ﬁne  aerosol  particles.  The 
reheating of the eﬄuent to reduce the relative humidity can help 
in reducing ammonium sulfate formation, since its formation takes 
place  in  water  droplets  [78] .  There  are  some  known  evidences 
of  the  presence  of  COS  and  H 
2 S  in  the  emissions  from  cement 
industry [78] . The reasons for this could be incomplete combustion 
in the kiln, the type of fuel used for burning, or the raw material 
containing  organic  sulfur,  and  detailed  studies  are  required  to 
understand their formation pathways. 

2.3.3. Gasiﬁcation and biogas plants 

The  gasiﬁcation  of  organic  and  fossil  fuels  (where  they  are 
heated  at  high  temperatures  in  a  controlled  environment  with 
limited amount of oxygen and/or steam) such as coal and biomass 
produces a mixture of CO, H 
2 that is referred to as syn- 
2 , and CO 
thesis gas (syngas), producer gas, or gasiﬁcation gas. Syngas is a 
pivotal industrial product because it can be directly used as a fuel 
for combustion engines [79] or to generate power [80] , and it also 
serves as an important intermediate in the manufacturing of sev- 
eral important industrial products such as ammonia [81] , methanol 
[82] , dimethyl ether [83] , and transportation fuels [84] . Since the 
gasiﬁcation feedstocks generally have some sulfur content, sulfur 
species are also present in the syngas. The type of sulfur species 
present in it depends upon the type of feedstock, gasiﬁcation tech- 
nology,  and  the  operating  conditions  of  the  gasiﬁcation  process 
2 S is commonly found in higher concentration 
[85] . In general, H 
2  [86] . In biomass gasiﬁcation, 
in syngas, followed by COS and CS 
2  and thiophenes, very scarce information is avail- 
other than CS 
able about any other sulfur containing species [87] . H 
2 S is mainly 
formed by the reduction of inorganic sulfur compounds, present in 
the feedstock at temperatures around 550 °C [88] . The inorganic 
2 S formation 
sulfur constituents of the fuel may also inﬂuence H 
during gasiﬁcation [89] . Mercaptans, disulﬁdes, and thiophenes in 
the fuel are known to volatilize into the gas phase, and they typ- 
2 S [85] . The secondary reactions between 
ically hydrogenate to H 
the  hydrocarbons  and  H 
2 S  in  the  gas  phase  may  also  produce 
them [88] . With temperatures greater than 800 °C, the pyrolysis of 
thiophenes are known to occur [90] . The combustion of such gas 
in furnaces or gas turbines leads to SO 

2 emissions. 

4 , CO 

2 , and small portions of H 

Biogas is a renewable energy source that is produced from the 
anaerobic  decomposition  of  organic  waste,  and  mainly  contains 
2 , as shown in Table 
CH 
8 ,  though  other  components  such  as  water  vapor  and  ammonia 
may  also  be  present  in  trace  quantities  [91,92] .  Before  biogas  is 
used for energy and/or heat production, H 
2 S in it must be reduced 
to  such  as  a  level  such  that  the  SO x  emission  during  biogas 
combustion is within the acceptable limit. Various physiochemical 

2 S and N 

processes [93,94] and biological techniques [92] are available for 
the cleansing of biogas (H 

2 S removal). 

2 is oxidized to SO 

2 , and SO 
2 , mercaptans, and sulﬁdes are burnt to produce SO 

It  is  clear  from  this  section  that  the  combustion  of  sulfur 
species  in  an  integral  part  of  various  industries,  where  H 
2 S  is 
combusted to produce elemental sulfur, sulfur is burnt to produce 
3 for sulfuric acid production, while 
SO 
CS 
2  and COS 
2 S). The majority of the processes 
(and COS is hydrolyzed to form H 
related to H 
2 and other sulfur species are meant for meeting 
the  strict  environment  regulations  on  sulfur  emissions,  and  the 
end products such as elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid are of low 
economic value. Thus, process optimization is highly sought after 
to reduce the operating costs. This has led to several fundamental 
studies  on  sulfur  combustion  to  understand  its  chemistry,  as 
discussed below.

3. Sulfur combustion chemistry 

The combustion of sulfurous species has been widely studied in 
the literature over several decades using a variety of tools such as 
lab-scale ﬂame setups, shock-tubes, batch and ﬂow reactors, tests 
on operating plants, quantum chemistry calculations for reaction 
kinetics and thermodynamics, and multi-scale process simulations. 
This section details the works that have helped in understanding 
the  sulfur  chemistry  and  developing  the  reaction  mechanism 
for  their  combustion  and  pyrolysis  for  process  modelling  and 
optimization. 

3.1. Experimental investigations 

3.1.1. Lab-scale experimental studies 

The  data  reporting  spatial  and  temporal  variation  in  species 
proﬁles  are  well-suited  for  the  validation  of  detailed  reaction 
mechanisms [95] . Several research groups have reported lab-scale 
experimental  studies  on  the  pyrolysis  and  the  high  temperature 
combustion  of  reduced  sulfur  species  (H 
2 ) 
using different reacting systems including shock-tubes [96] , ﬂames 
[97] , and ﬂow reactors [98] , as discussed below.

3.1.2.1. H 2 S  pyrolysis.  H 
2 S  pyrolysis  taking  place  in  the  initial 
stages  of  combustion  in  Claus  furnaces  in  parallel  with  the  oxi- 
dation reactions is important to generate the radical pool for the 
progress of the reactions. Since a detailed review on the experi- 
mental studies on H 
2 S was given up to the year 2015 in [17] , this 
section  examines  the  recent  experimental  studies  that  are  valu- 
able  in  validating  reaction  mechanisms  of  sulfurous  compounds. 
However,  before  that,  to  highlight  some  important  discrepancies 
in  the  literature  related  to  H 
2 S  pyrolysis,  some  previous  studies 
have been brieﬂy discussed. Several research groups have studied 
H 
2 S  pyrolysis  in  alumina  [99,100]  and  quartz  [101–104]  tubular 
reactors.  These  investigations  have  mainly  reported  the  experi- 
mental proﬁles of H 
2 yield as a function of 
residence time or distance in the reactor with feed containing high 
concentrations  (up  to  100%)  of  H 
2 S.  However,  the  studies  have 
conﬂicting conclusions that is explained here using the reported 
reaction  order  and  activation  energy  obtained  from  the  proﬁles 
of H 
2  production. Based on the data from 
alumina ﬂow reactors, Kaloidas and Papayannakos [99] and Harvey 
et  al.  [100]  reported  a  ﬁrst  order  dependency  with  respect  to 
H

However, on the basis of quartz reactor data, the kinetics for H 
pyrolysis  differed  even  amongst  similar  studies.  While  Darwent 
and Roberts [101] reported a second order dependency on H

its decomposition and an activation energy of 209 kJ/mol, a near 
ﬁrst order dependency and higher activation energy of 277 kJ/mole 
was observed in [102] within a temperature range of 900 - 1400 K.

Adesina et al. [103] reported ﬁrst order dependency on H 
2 S con- 
centration and an activation energy of 241 kJ/mol that are in fair 
agreement with those obtained by Karan et al. [104] and Tesner 
et  al.  [102] .  Clearly,  the  activation  energies  derived  from  quartz 
reactor data on H 
2 proﬁles were much higher than those from 
alumina ﬂow reactors due to the catalytic effect of alumina surface 
on H 
2 S pyrolysis. As discussed later, even quartz surfaces are ca- 
2 S reactions, and thus, the experimental data 
pable of catalyzing H 
from ﬂow reactors should be cautiously used for model validations. 
2 S  pyrolysis  have  emerged 
recently  aiming  to  facilitate  the  simultaneous  recovery  of  H 
2 
and  sulfur  from  H 
2 S,  particularly  to  address  the  challenges  that 
hinder  the  process  commercialization  [105] .  This  approach  is 
increasingly  being  propelled  as  an  alternative  means  of  utilizing 
the  increasing  volumes  of  H 
2 S  produced  from  sour  oil  and  gas 
reserves. Several research groups have sought to address some of 
the prevailing challenges such as low H 
2 yield (below equilibrium 
value)  [106]  and  high  energy  cost  [107]  experimentally,  while 
providing valuable experimental data for the validation of detailed 
reaction mechanisms. 
To increase the H 

2 yield, the addition of several chemical addi- 
2 S in acid gas streams has been tested 
tives that often accompany H 
such as CO 
2 [108] , and hydrocarbons including methane [105] and 
xylene  [106] .  El-Melih  and  coworkers  studied  the  effects  of  the 
addition of CO 
2 S py- 
rolysis in a quartz tubular reactor at different tem peratures (1273–
1573 K) and inlet stream concentrations. Their data showed that 
2 mixtures can lead to syngas produc- 
the pyrolysis of H 
tion at temperatures above 1373 K (though COS and SO 
2 removal 
in the product gas will be required), while the addition of small 
2 or syngas produc- 
amounts of methane or xylene can enhance H 
2 S (see Fig. 3 ).

Their data also showed that both methane and xylene can be 
destructed completely at a relatively low temperature of 1373 K 
during  H

2%)  with  increasing  reactor  temperatures,  and  carbon  deposits 
could  be  visibly  observed  on  the  reactor  walls.  El-Melih  and

of  H

various conditions examined, but did not report, in some studies,

operating  conditions  for  the  pyrolysis  and  partial  oxidation  (low 
4  in a quartz tube (plug 
oxygen atmosphere) of H 
ﬂow reactor). While they reported comprehensive results on major 
species  concentrations  including  COS,  CS 
2  in  the  ﬂue 
gas,  the  issue  of  carbon  deposition  on  reactor  surfaces  was  not 
reported. The problem of carbon deposition on the quartz reactor 
surfaces could be an important consideration in the modeling of 
H 
4  pyrolysis  systems.  Both  El-Melih  et  al.  [105]  and  Karan 
et al. [110] observed carbon deposits on the inner reactor surface 
during  experiments  with  feeds  that  had  H 
4  ratio  up  to  2, 
while at higher ratio above 2, the carbon deposition was hindered. 
These carbon deposits are formed due to the emergence of side 
reactions  at  high  temperatures  involving  hydrocarbons  species 
that  lead  to  the  production  of  higher  hydrocarbons  (such  as 
2 , and aromatics), and eventually, soot. Therefore, if the 
C 
modeling of carbon deposition while simulating H 
4 pyrolysis

4 ratios above 
is to be avoided, the experimental data with H 
2  in  feed  should  be  used.  With  respect  to  H 
2  production  from 
the mixtures of H 
2 S and various hydrocarbon additives, it will be 
required to address the problems of carbon deposits due to their 
capability to poison the catalysts used to accelerate the conversion 
2  capture.  Another  problem  that  may  have  to  be 
H 
addressed  during  the  pyrolysis  of  H 
2  in  the  presence 
of hydrocarbons is the production of harmful PAHs that could be 
aggravated with the presence of SO

While  the  high  temperatures  minimize  PAH  production  (by 
enhancing  their  oxidation)  [111] ,  they  promote  COS  and  CS

formation [112] . The formation of COS and CS 
2 with molar concen- 
trations up to 2% each in the ﬂue gas will contribute signiﬁcantly 
to  the  emission  of  harmful  sulfur  species  to  the  atmosphere.  In 
fact,  they  constitute  about  20%  of  the  total  sulfur  emissions  in 
the  incinerator’s  exhaust  gases  of  sulfur  producing  plants  [32] . 
Therefore, process optimization will be required to determine the 
most  suitable  process  conditions  that  minimizes  the  PAH,  COS,

thermal  stability  (up  to  1800  K)  and  under  the  belief  that  the 
quartz surfaces do not exhibit any catalytic activity on the decom- 
position process. In fact, El-Melih et al. [108,113] emphasized that 
the decomposition of H 
2 S was not sensitive to the quartz reactor 
surfaces  even  after  prolonged  operation  of  the  reactor,  which  is 
in agreement with the previous studies reported by Adesina et al. 
[103] ,  Karan  et  al.  [110] ,  and  Binoist  et  al.  [114] .  However,  Zhou 
et al. [115] , who investigated experimentally the effect of quartz 
surface  on  H 
3  coated  and 
uncoated  quartz  reactor),  reported  contradicting  ﬁndings.  It  was 
observed at 1270 K that the formation of H 
2 S increased 
from  26  ppm  in  the  B 
3  coated  quartz  reactor  to  37  ppm  in 
the uncoated one. This clearly conﬁrmed the catalytic activity of 
quartz surface on H 
2 S thermal decomposition. Nevertheless, it is 
possible  that  the  surface  effects  were  undetected  in  the  previ- 
ous  studies  because  their  data  were  obtained  at  nearly  thermal 
equilibrium conditions due to long residence times (up to 2 s).

3.1.2.2. H 2 S  oxidation.  H

different combustion conditions by varying equivalence ratio [98] , 
reactor  temperature  [116] ,  pressure  [117] ,  and  concentration  of 
the reacting mixture [118] . These studies provide a better under- 
standing  of  the  H

The experiments were mostly conducted in shock-tubes, laminar

3.1.2.2.1. Laminar  ﬂame  studies.  Some  experimental  studies 
2 S using different 
have examined the laminar burning velocity of H 
techniques, which provides valuable insight into the ﬂame stabi- 
lization characteristics. Chamberlin and Clarke [119] were the early 
investigators  of  the  laminar  ﬂame  speed  of  H 
2 S.  They  utilized  a 
tube (1 m long and 0.025 m internal diameter) that had a burner 
2 S/air  using  photographic 
tip  to  determine  the  ﬂame  speed  of  H 
method and reported a maximum ﬂame speed of about 49.5 cm/s 
with  10.8%  H 
2 S  burning  in  air.  Gibbs  et  al.  [120]  measured  and 
compared the laminar ﬂame speeds of several hydrocarbons and 
sulfur  species  including  H 
2 .  Kurz  [121]  used  a  Bunsen 
2 S addition on the ﬂame speed 
burner to investigate the effect of H 
of propane, and in this study, the measurements for pure H 
2 S-air 
ﬂame was also reported. It was observed that small amounts of 
H 
2 S  addition  to  propane/air  ﬂames  caused  a  marked  decrease 
in  the  ﬂame  speeds.  Under  lean  conditions,  an  increase  in  the 
amounts of H 
2 S concentrations (1.2 to 6 vol%) in the propane/air 
ﬂames decreased the ﬂame speed, while under fuel rich conditions 
(containing large amounts of H 
2 S), the ﬂame speeds of the ternary 
mixtures  were  either  slightly  higher  or  about  the  same  value 
as  the  fuel  component  burning  alone  with  air.  The  decrease  in 
ﬂame  speed  caused  by  the  addition  of  H 
2 S  was  attributed  to 
the  formation  of  disulfur  species  that  consumed  H  atoms  upon 
H 
2 S  ﬂame

ancies between the results can be observed, which highlights the

Flame  speeds  obtained  using  a  Bunsen  burner  and  speed

much higher than the ones reported in [122] using a counter-ﬂow 
conﬁguration.  Clearly,  the  laminar  burning  speeds  of  both  neat 
H 
2 S  with  hydrocarbons  needs  to  be  more 
accurately  examined.  It  was  noted  that  none  of  these  previous 
studies considered the ﬂame stretch effects, which highlights the 
need for more accurate determination of the laminar ﬂame speed 
in order to improve the current knowledge of H 

2 S  and  blends  of  H

[128] conducted experimental and theoretical studies to improve 
the  understanding  of  H

the experimental data on the ignition delay times from the mix- 
2  diluted  in  argon  and  seeded  with  various 
tures  of  1%H

concentrations of H 
that the addition of H

of the H 
2  mixture signiﬁcantly. A similar study was reported 
2 /O 
by  Bradley  and  Dobson  [129] ,  who  investigated  the  ignition  of 
H 
2  mixtures  in  86–88%  diluted  argon  behind  reﬂected 
2  addition  on  the 
shock  waves.  They  observed  the  effect  of  H 
2 S oxidation within a tempera- 
appearance of OH and SO 
ture range of 1735–2340 K. While the addition of H 
2 enhanced the 
H 
2 oxidation due to 
the competition for molecular oxygen that occurred between them. 
In another study, Mathieu et al. [96] investigated the ignition delay 
times and laser-absorption water time histories of H 
2 mixtures 
diluted  in  98%  Ar  in  two  different  shock  tubes  at  atmospheric 
pressure and temperatures range of 1445 to 2210 K. They noted

the ignition delay times and the H 
2 O proﬁles with fair accuracy. 
It was conjectured that more accurate rates for some of the key 
reactions involving SH, HSSH and HO 
2 intermediate species would 
be needed to predict H 
2 S combustion chemistry with higher accu- 
racy. Mulvihill et al. [130] studied the combustion characteristics 
4 blends, and reported the experimental data on the oxi- 
of H 
2 S/CH 
dation of H 
4 mixtures in 99% argon at temperatures between 
2 S/CH 
1538 and 1889 K and pressures near 1 atm. They measured the 
time histories of CO and H 
2 O using laser absorption diagnostics at 
4.5 and 1.4 μm under fuel-lean (equivalence ratio = 0.5) condi- 
tions. It was observed that the interactions of species containing 
both carbon and sulfur were negligible under fuel lean conditions, 
and  CH 
4  chemistry  was  found  to  be  more  dominant  during  the 
co-oxidation process. Despite these recent studies, the current un- 
2 S ignition is still far from satisfactory, partly due 
derstanding of H 
to the limited amount of experimental data available and the large 
uncertainties in the available data, particularly laminar ﬂame speed 
and  ﬂow  reactor  measurements.  The  investigations  using  shock- 
tubes offer a more convenient means of investigating the kinetics 
of  elementary  reactions  related  to  sulfur  species  (shown  later)

of  sulfur  chemistry  in  industrial  Claus  process  plants.  Selim  and 
co-workers reported several experimental studies on the oxidation

Ibrahim  and  co-workers  investigated  the  effect  of  aromatics,

2 S in oxygen enriched air ﬂames. These studies have 
oxidation of H 
been reviewed in detail by Gupta et al. [17] . More recently, Li et 
al.  [97]  reported  experimental  data  from  a  quartz  tube  reactor 
2 . They studied the effect of oxygen 
containing ﬂames of H 
enrichment in air on the oxidation of H 
2 S and the decomposition 
2  formation  at  an 
of  CO 
equivalence  ratio  ( (cid:4))  of  0.8,  1,  and  3.  It  was  found  that  higher 
oxygen  concentration  contributed  to  higher  ﬂame  temperature, 
which  accelerated  H 
2 S  oxidation  and  increased  the  formation 
of CS 
2  from 0.75 to 2% and CO and COS from 0.5 to 1.75%. The 
formation of COS occurred primarily from the reaction of SH and 
2  and  from  the  secondary  reactions  between  CO  and  sulfur 
CO 
species. The CS 
2  formation involved a more complex mechanism 
involving reactions with CS intermediate. In another paper [106] ,

2 S and CH 
the oxidation of premixed H

of oxidation competition between H

co-oxidation  of  H 
unequal  rates  of  H 
2  and 
4  oxidation  will  increase  CS 
COS formation that decreases sulfur production in practical Claus

plants, even though the concentration of CH 
studies is much higher than that in practical Claus plants. In the 
studies of Colom-Diaz et al. [118] and Li et al. [97] , the inﬂuence 
of surface effects on H 
2 S oxidation was not reported by the au- 
thors. However, a data comparison showed that, while Zhou et al. 
[131] observed a temperature of 1025 K and 1045 K for the onset 
of H 
2 ratio of 0.52 and 0.54,

Assuming that coating the reactor with B 
surface  reactions  as  conjectured  by  Zhou  et  al.  [131]  and  Song 
et  al.  [98] ,  the  comparison  of  Colom-Diaz  et  al.’s  data  with  the 
ones reported by Zhou et al. [131] suggest that the quartz reactor 
surface  may  have  assisted  in  catalyzing  H 
2 S  oxidation.  However, 
Jorgensen et al. [142] investigated the ability of quartz, alumina, 
and  iron  oxide  to  catalyze  the  oxidation  of  SO 
3  in  the 
temperature range of 873–1273 K, and found the quartz surface to 
be  inert,  while  alumina  promoted  the  oxidation.  These  apparent 
discrepancies on the surface effects of quartz reactors could be at- 
tributed to differences in surface conditions. Although the siloxane 
surface (Si-O-Si) in quartz is very inert, surface radicals are formed 
due to the cleavage of Si-O bond in the formation of new silica 
surface  from  cutting,  fracturing  or  grinding.  In  the  presence  of 
H 
2 O (vapor), the silicon radicals can react rapidly to form reactive 
silanol  (SiOH)  groups.  While  the  inert  siloxane  surface  may  be 
restored by removing hydroxyl groups through thermal treatment, 
previous studies have shown that complete dehydroxylation is not 
achieved even at 1373 K [143] , which can lead to differences in 
the surface conditions of quartz reactors.

Some  researchers  have  reported  a  number  of  ﬂow  reactor

of catalytic reactions at reactor walls is expected to be minimal.

because  of  the  uniform  temperature  proﬁle  and  the  negligible 
interference of heterogeneous reactions at the walls of the reactor. 
3.1.2.2.3. Flow reactor studies.  A number of ﬂow reactor studies 
on  the  oxidation  of  neat  H 
2 S  and  its  blends  with  hydrocarbons 
have  been  reported  [105,118] .  Some  of  them  are  detailed  in  the 
review  article  by  Gupta  et  al.  [17] .  However,  a  number  of  new 
studies  were  published  in  recent  years  that  have  improved  the 
knowledge of the H 
2 S combustion chemistry, which are addressed 
here.  Zhou  et  al.  [131]  conducted  experimental  and  modelling 
studies  with  the  aim  of  improving  the  performance  of  existing 
kinetic models on H 
2 S oxidation under low and high temperature 
conditions. In one of their papers [131] , they studied the oxidation 
2 S  in  an  atmospheric  pressure  ﬂow  reactor  at  temperatures 
of  H 
from 950 to 1150 K under fuel-lean conditions. The H 
2 S oxidation 
reaction was found to be strongly catalyzed by silica surface of the 
reactor,  but  the  application of  B 
3  coating  to  the  silica surface 
successfully suppressed these catalytic effects (see Fig. 5 ).

It was noted that the reaction of H 

2 S with oxygen exhibited a 
2 formation (40%), even in the presence 
very high selectivity to H 
of a large excess of oxygen. However, it could not be proved con- 
clusively that the B 
3 coating did not have any residual effect on 
the course of the reaction. It was observed that the characteristic 
temperature for reaction rises by some hundreds of degrees when 
the coating is applied, thus suggesting a dominance of gas-phase 
reactions. This surface effect could pose diﬃculties in evaluating 
the accuracy of kinetic models and reconciliation of experimental 
data from ﬂow  reactor, shock tube and ﬂame systems.  Palma et 
al.  [107]  investigated  the  oxidation  of  10%  H 
2 S  in  a  low  oxygen 
2 S ratio (0.2–0.35), residence time 
atmosphere, by varying the O 
(0.15–0.3 s), and process temperatures (1173–1373 K). They identi- 
ﬁed the optimal operating conditions with the O 
2 S ratio of 0.2, 
a temperature of 1373 K and a residence time of 0.15 s suitable to 
obtain a high H 
2 yield of 20%, 
2 S conversion of about 60%, a good H 
2  selectivity (3%). While a quartz ﬂow reactor was 
and a low SO 
used for this study, its catalytic effects on the results were not re- 
ported. In an effort to broaden the understanding of H 
2 S oxidation 
under wide range of conditions, Colom-Diaz et al. [118] studied the 
oxidation of H 
2 S in a tubular ﬂow reactor at atmospheric pressure 
and  temperature  range  of  70 0–140 0  K  under  different  reaction 
atmospheres  by  varying  the  air  excess  ratio  ( λ)  from  reducing 
( λ = 0.32) to oxidizing conditions ( λ = 19.46). The concentrations 
of H

data  at  atmospheric  pressure  (for  the  feed  with  H

0.326).  Clearly,  it  is  imperative  to  investigate  and  report  on  the 
effects  of  surface  reactions  in  the  H 
2 S  oxidation  experiments  to 
assist in developing more reliable kinetic models to help provide 
clarity on the sulfur combustion chemistry. Some other studies on 
2 S  at  high  pressures  have  also  been  reported. 
the  oxidation  of  H 
Gersen et al. [117] studied the auto-ignition behavior of H 
2 S and 
hydrocarbon  fuels  in  a  rapid  compression  machine  (RCM)  and 
2 S 
in  a  high-pressure  ﬂow  reactor  to  quantify  the  impact  of  H 
on the occurrence of knocking in engines using natural gas. The 
quartz ﬂow reactor experiments performed at 50 bar showed that, 
2 S reactivity was much faster 
for stoichiometric conditions, the H 
2 S  (200  ppm)/CH 
than  that  of  CH 
4 
(1500  ppm)  mixture.  A  large  fraction  of  the  H 
2 S  was  already 
consumed at 600 K, while temperatures above 750 K were needed 
to oxidize 10% of methane. The authors also observed the catalytic 
effects of the quartz reactor surface on H 
2 S oxidation and conjec- 
tured that they were negligible under the high-pressure condition 
investigated.  This  agrees  with  the  experimental  observations  of 
a similar study reported by Song et al. [98] , where the oxidation 
of  H 
2 S  at  high  pressure  (30  and  100  bar)  under  oxidizing  and 
stoichiometric  conditions  within  a  temperatures  range  of  450 
to  925  K  and  residence  times  of  3–20  s  was  investigated.  At 
near-stoichiometric conditions with a reactor pressure of 30 bar, 
the oxidation of H 
2 S was initiated at 600 K and almost completed 
at 900 K, while under oxidizing conditions (with excess oxygen), 
the onset temperature for reaction was 500–550 K depending on 
2 S oxidation 
the pressure and the residence time with complete H 
to  SO 
2  occurring  within  550–600  K.  The  increase  in  the  reactor 
pressure  up  to  100  bar  decreased  the  temperature  required  for 
the initiation of H 
2 S oxidation to around 475 K and the complete 
oxidation occurred at about 550 K. The earlier onset temperature 
for H 
2 S oxidation at higher pressure was partly attributed to the 
longer  residence  time  at  100  bar.  Similar  results  were  obtained 
in quartz and alumina tubes, despite some deviations in the resi- 
dence time. This helped to demonstrate the negligible inﬂuence of 
2 S oxidation. The differences in surface effects 
surface effects on H 
between the atmospheric pressure study of Zhou et al. [131] and 
the  above  mentioned  high  pressure  studies  on  H 
2 S  oxidation 
can be attributed to the possible change in the balance between 
surface initiation/oxidation and the consumption of radicals on the 
reactor walls due to the differences in temperature and pressure 
of the reactor. The quartz surface may either initiate reaction and 
promote H 
2 S oxidation or inhibit the surface oxidation reactions 
possibly  by  acting  as  a  radical  sink.  However,  further  studies 
are required to provide a better understanding of theses surface 
reactions  and  to  quantify  them  in  order  to  improve  the  current 
knowledge  of  sulfur  combustion  processes.  The  apparent  lack  of 
clarity on the catalytic effects of reactor surfaces on H 
2 S oxidation 
also  affects the  modeling  of  sulfur  combustion  processes.  In  ad- 
dition, most of the kinetic studies on H 
2 S pyrolysis and oxidation 
have been conducted in tubular quartz reactors that pose certain 
inconveniences  [98,144] ,  while  a  few  others  were  conducted  in 
perfectly  stirred  reactors  [114] .  The  tubular  quartz  reactors  are 
often considered to behave like plug-ﬂow reactors, in which the 
concentrations of the reactants, products, and intermediates result 
from the integration of the gradients of concentrations along the 

reactors under different chemical compositions. In these lab-scale 
tubular  reactors,  the  temperature  proﬁle  may  not  necessarily  be 
constant and sometimes not measured and/or reported by authors. 
The assumption of plug ﬂow may not always be fulﬁlled even at 
low residence time in a laminar gas ﬂow regime. And, in a very 
complex reacting system such as those of H 
2 S pyrolysis and oxida- 
tion, the reaction kinetics and product speciation are very sensitive 
to the temperature and to some extent the reactor hydrodynamics.

Some researchers have studied the reaction mechanism of COS and 
CS

key elementary reactions. Sheen et al. [146] investigated the oxi- 
dation of diluted CS 
2 and COS in a shock tube at initial pressures 
between  10  and  30  torr.  The  Chemiluminescence  accompanying 
the  reaction  was  recorded  at  temperatures  between  1600  and 
2100 K. The oxidation of COS was found to be much slower than 
that of CS 
2 , which takes place through a more complex pathway.

for different ratio of CS

imental technique deployed in this work could lead to unreliable 
results. Firstly, the reactants were preheated to high temperature 
prior to mixing at the entrance to the reaction zone, which could 
lead  to  the  formation  of  atomic  oxygen  that  can  promote  the

using the experimental data for model validation. The gas-phase

reactions in  the  Claus  furnace.  In the  study  by  Clark  et  al.  [33] , 
they reported experimental data on COS formation and oxidation 
from an atmospheric pressure ﬂow reactor at temperatures above

10 0 0 K. They measured the concentration proﬁles of COS, CS

2  at different tem peratures and residence times 
up to 2 s in the reactor. Abian et al. [13] reported experimental 
data on the conversion of CS 
2 and COS in the presence of moisture 
in a laboratory quartz ﬂow reactor at atmospheric pressure. The 
effects  of  tem perature  in  the  range  of  30 0–140 0  K  and  excess 
air  ratio  (ranging  from  fuel  rich  to  fuel  lean  conditions)  on  the 
oxidation  of  COS  and  CS

the  ﬁnal  products,  CO

temperature range of 900–925 K at constant residence time, while 
COS  conversion  proceeded  gradually  within  a  temperature  range 
of 1025–1175 K. The data suggested that CS 
2 oxidation (520 ppm 
CS 
2 ) involves a more complex mechanism than 
the oxidation of COS, as it leads to the formation of COS (up to 
100 ppm) as an intermediate product. Clearly, these studies have

and up to 225 K for COS depending on the equivalence ratio used. 
This rapid conversion of COS and CS 
2 to products is not well suited 
for observing the details of the oxidation process, particularly the 
speciation  of  the  reaction  intermediates.  Some  intermediate 
species formed during the CS 
2 and COS oxidation process may not 
be able to resist the high ignition temperature (above 900 K) in 
ﬂow reactors. This point was noted in the work of Zeng and co- 
workers [151] who conducted experimental and theoretical studies 
to  improve  the  understanding  on  the  combustion  mechanism  of 
reduced sulﬁde species. They chose to study the oxidation of CS 
2 
in a jet-stirred reactor and observed relatively lower ignition tem- 
perature for CS 
2 (740 K) and slower conversion of COS to the ﬁnal 
2 (that occurred within a temperature margin 
products, CO and SO 
of 740–10 0 0 K), when compared to experimental results from the 
tubular ﬂow reactors. The lower CS 
2 ignition temperature occurred 
due to faster chain initiation in the jet-stirred reactor than that in 
the tubular ﬂow reactor. The jet stirred reactor produces favorable 
turbulence  that  induces  the  homogeneous distribution  of  all the 
species in the reactor. Therefore, the slow conversion of COS and 
lower  ignition  temperature  in  a  jet  stirred  reactor  provided  a 
window  of  opportunity  to  probe  the  detailed  reactions  involved 
in COS formation and conversion, on the basis of which the au- 
thors proposed a revision to the existing mechanisms on CS

reactor surface by observing differences in the onset temperature 
for  CS

A few ﬂow reactor studies have been reported on the oxidation 
of  methyl  [152]  and  diethyl  [153]  mercaptans  under  different 
reactor conditions. These studies were conducted in an effort to 
build  detailed  kinetic  mechanisms  to  model  the  incineration  of 
mustard agent (Bis(2-chloroethyl) sulﬁde) and to predict the safety 
of  their  incineration.  In  separate  studies,  Zheng  and  co-workers 
reported  experimental  data  on  the  oxidation  of  diethyl  sulﬁde 
(100  ppm)  [153]  and  ethyl  methyl  sulﬁde  [154]  in  a  turbulent 
ﬂow  reactor  over  a  temperature  range  of  630–740  °C,  under 
near-stoichiometric  conditions  and  fuel-lean  conditions.  Species 
analyses were conducted using a combination of Fourier transform 
infrared  spectroscopy  and  gas  chromatography/mass  spectrom-

etry  along  the  centerline  of  the  ﬂow  reactor.  Several  species 
2  were  detected 
including  C 
2 , ethyl methyl 
with concentrations of 1 ppm or higher, while CS 
disulﬁde, and diethyl disulﬁde were also detected and estimated 
to be below 1 ppm. They observed that the conversions of ethyl 
methyl  sulﬁde  were  signiﬁcantly  lower  than  those  for  diethyl 
sulﬁde  under  identical  experimental  conditions.  This  observation 
was  found  to  be  due  to  either  lower  hydrogen  abstraction  rates 
or lower hydrogen atom production as a result of differences in 
the thermal decomposition pathways. In a recent study, Alzueta et 
al. [152] studied the oxidation of methyl sulﬁde in a quartz ﬂow 
tubular  reactor  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  in  the  temperature 
range  of  30 0–140 0  K.  The  main  sulfur-containing  products  de-

of  temperature,  oxygen  concentration,  and  the  presence  of  H 
2 O 
on  the  conversion  and  the  formation  of  byproducts  during  the 
oxidation of methyl mercaptan. The increase in temperature and 
oxygen concentrations favored the oxidation of methyl mercaptan, 
while the presence of H 
2 O had negligible effect on its oxidation. 
In the above studies, mercaptan oxidation to ﬁnal products in ﬂow 
reactors occurred very rapidly within a temperature margin of up 
to 50 K. Such a rapid oxidation process does not allow an experi- 
mentalist to acquire concentration proﬁles suitable for developing 
kinetic models. Also, in the available experimental data, the effects 
of quartz surfaces on mercaptan oxidation were not reported and 
could not be ascertained due to the limited availability of data for 
comparison under similar conditions. The oxidation of mercaptans 
generates intermediate species such as H 
2 and OH, which 
could facilitate heterogeneous reactions on the reactor surface, and 
further investigations on these are required.

The plant tests related to sulfur combustion have focused on 
the oxidation of acid gas (consisting of H 
3 and 
hydrocarbons) in the thermal section of the SRUs. Depending on 
the acid gas composition, the temperature of the combusted gas in 
the furnace is in a range of 1100 to 1527 °C, and at the WHB outlet, 
the temperature is around 300 °C [155–157] . A limited number of 
industrial and pilot plant data have been reported in [31,116,155–
165] ,  albeit  with  limited  information  regarding  the  furnace  and 
WHB  geometries,  sampling  methods,  and  analytical  techniques. 
The assembly of the SRU plants does not have the provision for 
online sensors to be inserted at different locations inside the fur- 
nace or the WHB. So, sampling ports are created at key locations 
such as at the exits of the furnace and the WHB and at the sulfur 
condenser  outlets.  The  details  of  the  feed  stream  compositions, 
test  conditions,  distribution  of  products  exiting  the  furnace  and, 
in some cases, the waste heat boiler are often provided and are 
used to conduct SRU simulations. The gas sampling and quenching 
procedure and the temperature, at which measurements are made, 
remain  largely  unavailable,  which  causes  some  disagreement 
between  the  computed  and  the  observed  values,  especially  for 
sulfur  and  other  species  that  undergo  recombination  reactions 
at low temperatures in the WHB. Therefore, a ﬁne-tuning of the 
kinetic model parameters is often conducted to match the plant 
data  with  the  model  outcomes  [116,163,165] ,  which  could  make 
these models unsuitable for dynamic simulations and optimization 
over  a  wide  range  of  SRU  parameters.  Nevertheless,  the  plant 
test data have been used in validating some model assumptions 
(such as reaction furnace being modelled as an adiabatic plug ﬂow 
reactor and the waste heat boiler being modelled as a plug ﬂow 
reactor with heat exchange) and the reaction mechanisms used to 
predict and optimize fuel gas consumption [31,164,166] , especially 
those  that  are  available  for  a  long  period  of  time  ranging  from 
1  to  12  months  [167] .  The  kinetic  models  that  have  been  well 
validated  with  plant  data  available  over  a  long  period  of  time

together  with  lab-scale  data  found  over  an  appreciable  range  of 
pressure, temperature, equivalence ratio, and ﬂow rates are useful 
in the analysis of the tail gas composition from the SRUs to obtain 
information  on  the  emission  of  harmful  sulfurous  species  with 
respect to operational changes in the plant [157] . 

3.2. Global reaction models for claus furnace design 

The lab-scale data are fruitful in understanding the kinetics of 
some combustion reactions and the product distribution at various 
process  conditions,  though  it  is  diﬃcult  to  assess  the  impact  of 
changes  in  process  parameters  on  the  functioning  of  industrial 
reactors  using  lab-scale  setups  as  that  would  be  expensive  and 
time-consuming. The reaction models have been used to support 
such studies through simulation, as highlighted below. 

3.2.1. Equilibrium approach vs. kinetic approach with global reactions 
The  equilibrium  and  the  kinetic  strategies  are  two  different 
modeling approaches for the thermal section of SRU [168] . Equi- 
librium  reactor  approach  (Gibbs  free  energy  minimization  and 
chemical  equilibrium  constant  calculation)  is  used  to  estimate 
the  product  concentration  at  chemical  equilibrium  for  a  given 
feed  composition  and  ﬁnal  pressure  and  temperature  because 
sulfur recovery is limited by the equilibrium of the Claus reaction 
[169–173] . The equilibrium model is only for the early stage ma- 
terial and energy balance studies, and cannot be used in reactor 
conﬁguration and sizing studies. 

The  global  kinetic  modeling  of  SRU  involves  incorporating 
the  chemical  reactions  along  with  the  kinetic  parameters  with 
the material and energy balance equations of reactor systems to 
obtain  temperature,  pressure,  and  reactant  and  product  species 
distribution  in  the  reactor.  The  reaction  rates  are  obtained  by 
ﬁtting  the  kinetic  models  in  the  form  of  power-law  expressions 
through the experimental data on the concentrations of all sulfur 
species  that  are  discussed  in  Section  3.1 .  Some  key  reactions 
occurring in the furnace include H 
2 S pyrolysis and 
2  formation,  and  light  hydrocarbon 
recombination,  COS  and  CS 
(C1-C4)  oxidation,  as  discussed  in  [17,175] .  The  reactions  are 
referred to as “global reaction set” or “global reaction model” in 
the SRU thermal section. Table A1 in the appendix gives the list of 
the candidate reactions, applicable to the Claus furnace. Contrary 
to the equilibrium models, global kinetic models ﬁnd applications 
in reactor design, sizing, scale-up, and optimization studies.

3.2.2. Applications in plant design 

Some  studies  have  focused  on  the  kinetic  modeling  of  the 
SRU  using  the  global  reactions  [159,161,177,198]  by  developing a 
mathematical  model  for  the  Claus  furnace.  Except  for  the  work 
of Jones et al. [176] , most works [159,161,177,198] have solved the 
mathematical  models  in  MATLAB  using  Runge-Kutta  method  by 
modeling  the  furnace  as  an  adiabatic  plug  ﬂow  reactor.  Nasato 
et al. [199] and Karan et al. [200] developed the kinetic models 
of  WHB  by  considering  it  to  be  a  PFR  with  heat  transfer-.  The 
motivation for it was the observation from the industrial data of 
Sames et al. [31] , which showed an increase in the concentration 
of H 
2 , and 
CO.  The  lower  temperatures  in  WHB  favored  the  recombination 
reactions  involving  H 
2 S  and  COS.  The 
most  important  reaction  in  WHB  is,  however,  the  conversion  of 
2 )  to  elemental  sulfur.  At  high  temperatures  (inside  the 
sulfur  (S 
Claus furnace), sulfur exists dominantly as S 
2 . With the decrease 
in the temperature near the end of the Claus furnace and in the 
WHB, other allotropes of sulfur (S 
8 ) begin to exist.

One of the ﬁrst works on listing global reactions for the Claus 
furnace  was  by  Pollock  [201] ,  where  7–8  reactions  each  for  the 
ﬂame zone and the anoxic zone were presented, though no details 
were  provided  on  the  selection  of  the  reactions.  Jones  et  al. 
[176] identiﬁed a set of reactions, and presented an optimization 
study to ﬁnd optimal steam pressure and H 
2  ratio for high 
power generation and desired hydrogen yield and oxygen demand. 
Nabikandi  and  Fatemi  [161]  compared  equilibrium  and  kinetic 
approaches to conclude that the latter one was more suitable for 
simulations,  though  the  use  of  equilibrium  approach  for  WHB 
modeling make their results less reliable. A similar conclusion was 
reached in [198] . Zarei et al. [155,177] showed that PFR model was 
suitable for furnace modelling, and presented sensitivity analysis 
and  optimization  studies.  However,  the  ﬁtting  of  kinetic  param- 
eters  with  a  speciﬁc  plant  data  make  their  model  less  reliable 
for the simulation of wide range of industrial SRUs with varying 
feed conditions. Also, no reactions were present for the conversion

of sulfur allotropes (S

sensitivity analysis and multi-objective optimization (with surface 
response  methodology),  but  observed  major  deviations  in  the 
predicted  results  from  the  plant  data  for  COS,  CO,  H

due to the usage of limited number of reactions and less reliable 
kinetic parameters.

3.2.3. CFD simulations 

The  simulation  of  the  Claus  furnace  and  WHB  as  zero- 
dimensional  or  one-dimensional  ideal  reactors,  presented  above, 
do not capture the gas ﬂow behavior and chemical species trans- 
port that could affect the predicted combustion temperature, sulfur 
recovery,  and  product  speciation.  To  overcome  these  challenges, 
Abdoli et al. [116] conducted CFD simulations of the Claus furnace 
using the k- ε turbulent ﬂow model, six step global reaction model 
for  acid  gas  combustion,  and  a  radiation  heat  transfer  model. 
2  enrichment in dry air 
Through simulations, they showed that O 
could  enhance  the  combustion  temperature  and  sulfur  recovery, 
while minimizing the emission of the contaminants. In [165] , the 
effect  of  feed  preheating  temperatures  on  the  SRU  performance 
was  examined.  The  results  conﬁrmed  that  preheating  of  inlet 
air  and  acid  gas  increases  combustion  temperature  and  sulfur 
recovery, and reduces the concentration of contaminants such as 
COS and CS 
2 . While CFD simulations on acid gas combustion using 
global  models  are  frequently  used  by  burner  and  reactor  manu- 
facturers,  the  information  on  the  reaction  mechanism  used  and 
the detailed results of such simulations in the open literature are 
limited [202–207] . For example, Sikorski et al. [202] demonstrated 
the application of CFD for the analysis of bypass gas mixing effects 
on  the  reaction  furnace  performance.  They  examined  different 
bypass ﬂow injection method and location on the performance of 
sulfur plants. It was observed that the single, radial bypass inlet 
yields better mixing than a tangentially oriented inlet regardless 
of  whether  the  ﬂow  is  co-  or  counter-rotating,  while  the  four 
radial bypass inlets resulted in better mixing when compared to 
a  single  radial  inlet.  However,  the  operation  of  reaction  furnace 
without any ﬂow bypass allowed for a higher ﬂame temperature 
to be achieved, and hence, a better performance. 

Wilson et al. [203] conducted a CFD simulation to evaluate the 
performance of a proposed burner design for the inline reheater, 
used to heat acid gas to temperatures up to 500 °C by mixing it 
with  hot  reducing  products  of  natural  gas  combustion.  The  CFD 
model accounted for the reactions of H 
2 S with 
oxygen. The results indicated that mixing in the near burner zone

In recent years, CFD simulations have also been used to study 
the revamp of existing sulfur production plants and improve the 
burner  and  reaction  furnace  design  to  increase  the  processing 
capacity of acid gas, while minimizing the operating cost and re- 
ducing the shutdown period [204,205] . High intensity burners that 
favor higher sulfur production in the furnace, better destruction of 
impurities and lower concentrations of CS 
2 in the eﬄuent gas from 
the furnace are being developed with the aid of CFD [206,207] . 

3.2.4. Limitations 

2 S + CH 

2 S oxidation and (H 

Based on our critiquing of literature works related to SRU plant 
simulations using global reaction models in the Claus furnace, we 
have identiﬁed the following limitations: (a) While it seems that 
Table A1 covers a signiﬁcant list of reactions occurring within the 
Claus furnace, this list is not comprehensive in any manner. For 
instance, Zarei [208] pointed out several other chemical reactions 
concerning pure H 
4 ) mixture oxidation 
that  can  occur  in  a  Claus  furnace.  Thus,  there  is  no  systematic 
procedure to identify a complete list of global reactions that can 
be used in SRU plant designs. (b) In the published literature works 
related to the global kinetic models, the authors have either used 
kinetic  parameters  for  the  chemical  reactions  available  from  the 
literature or have attempted to re-ﬁt the kinetic parameters with 
a plant dataset [155,176,177] . Such approach can only provide good 
predictions for a speciﬁc industrial data, and may fail, when ap- 
plied to other plant conditions. Even within the same plant, during 
plant optimization studies, when the operating conditions are var- 
ied, the ﬁtted model may lead to erroneous results. For the studies 
using  the  kinetic  rate  parameters  from  the  literature,  a  consid- 
erable  caution  needs  to  be  exercised  because  those  parameters 
may be valid for speciﬁc experimental conditions such as limited 
temperature  and  pressure  ranges  and  feed  compositions.  Table 
A1 serves as an important evidence in this regard, as we notice 
different reaction rate expressions and kinetic parameters for the 
same chemical reaction being used by different authors. (c) It was 
noted in the above works that, despite the usage of kinetic models, 
differences were still present between the industrial data and the 
computed results from the global reaction. The major deviations 
were found in those species whose production is controlled by re- 
action kinetics such as COS, CS 
2 , and CO. This demonstrates the 
2 , H 
need to understand and incorporate detailed reaction mechanisms 
into the models of SRU thermal section even in the preliminary 
and basic stages of front-end engineering designs. Additionally, as 
a standard practice, SRUs are ﬁred with fuel gas (natural gas) to- 
gether with acid gas (which also contain some light hydrocarbons, 
aromatics  and  impurities)  to  maintain  the  ﬂame  temperature  in 
the furnace. There can be complex chemical crosslinking between 
hydrocarbons and sulfur species during combustion in the furnace, 
thus  affecting  the  concentrations  of  each  other  and  producing 
new species. The aromatic reactions are kinetically controlled, and 
are  diﬃcult  to  be  described  using  one  or  two  global  reactions. 
These  limitations  demand  the  development  of  detailed  reaction 
mechanisms consisting of elementary reactions, possibly from ﬁrst 
principles, for improved experimental data prediction and process 
optimization of sulfur-related processes. 

3.3. Reaction kinetics from experiments and quantum calculations 

During the combustion of H 

2 S in air in the presence of SO 

2 , hy- 
drocarbons and other sulfur species, there are some key reactions 
(mostly the initiation reactions) that have been studied widely by 
several research groups  to  determine  the  reaction pathways and 
the  reaction  kinetics.  The  notable  experimental  and  theoretical 
works,  which  helped  in  establishing  the  reaction  mechanism 
for  the  key  reactions  and  provided  their  chemical  kinetics,  are 
discussed below. 

2 + S 

3.3.1. H 2 S decomposition and H 2 + S reactions 
During the pyrolysis and oxidation of H 

2  and S from H 

2 S or acid gas, the ther- 
2 S is considered an important initiation re- 
mal decomposition of H 
action  [209,210] ,  and  several  studies  have  focused  on  determin- 
ing  the  pathway  and  the  reaction  kinetics  for  it.  While  one  of 
the early studies on pure H 
2 S decomposition was by Darwent et 
al.  [101] ,  where  they  studied  its  pyrolysis  at  720–970  K  and  at 
30–300  torr  to  conclude  that  the  reaction  was  of  second  order 
(2H2S (cid:3) 2H 
2 ), the rate constant was not provided. A high- 
temperature investigation that followed it was a shock tube study 
by Higashihara et al. [211] using a feed containing 5% H 
2 S in Ar at 
2380–30 0 0 K and at pressures less than 460 torr, where the con- 
2  was measured. Based on their observation of no 
centration of S 
2  formation,  the  species,  H,  SH,  and  S  were 
induction  time  for  S 
assumed  to  be  at  steady  state.  Using  a  mechanism  for  H 
2 S  de- 
2 S + M → H + HS + M ,  a 
composition  with  the  primary  step  being  H 
rate constant for this reaction was calculated. Another shock-tube 
2 S  in  Ar  was  pre- 
2 S  decomposition  with  1.4–2.5%  H 
study  on  H 
sented  by  Bowman  and  Dodge  [125] ,  where  H 
2 S  and  S  concen- 
trations  were  measured  using  spectroscopic  techniques.  Same  as 
Higashihara et al. [211] , they also assumed S-H bond breaking in 
2 S to form SH and H as the initiation reaction, and provided a 
H 
rate  constant  for  it  at  270 0–380 0 K.  Roth  et  al.  [126]  presented 
a  similar  study  at  lower  temperatures  (1965–2560 K),  and  mea- 
sured  H  atom  concentrations  using  atomic  resonance  absorption 
spectrophotometry  in  a  shock  tube  at  1.8–2  bar.  With  the  same 
2 S decomposes to HS and H, 
assumption as previous studies that H 
they provided its rate constant. Note that there were no evidences 
from their experimental data to suggest that H 
2 S decomposition 
2 S + M → H + HS + M .  The  studies  by Woiki  and Roth 
proceeds via  H 
[212] and Olschewski et al. [213] were the ones that indicated the 
2 S decomposition. This was 
direct formation of H 
in contrast with the previous assumption of H + HS formation from 
it.  Woiki  and  Roth  [212]  conducted  a  shock  tube  study  with  5–
2 S in Ar at 1887–2891 K and at 1.3 bar, and observed a 
100 ppm H 
near-linear increase in H and S proﬁles with decreasing H 
2 S con- 
centration at early induction times. This led to the conclusion that 
2 S, and they proposed a rate constant 
S is directly produced from H 
2 + S + M . 
for this spin forbidden elimination reaction, H 
In the same year, Olschewski et al. [213] also reached to the same 
2 S in 
conclusion in their shock tube study with 20 0–50 0 0 ppm H 
Ar at 180 0–330 0 K, and provided a new rate constant for the same 
reaction. Shiina et al. [214] further investigated H 
2 S decomposition 
experimentally  using  shock  tubes  and  theoretically  using  ab  ini- 
tio (MRCI + Q ) calculations. The rate constant for H 
2 S + M → products 
was  measured  using  infrared  emission  spectroscopy  at  2740–
3570  K,  which  was  one-ﬁfth  to  one-tenth  of  those  proposed  by 
Woiki  and  Roth  [212]  and  Olschewski  et  al.  [213] .  Their  theo- 
retical  study  on  singlet-triplet  crossing  reaction  on  H 
2 S  dissoci- 
2 + 3 S  being  the  major  product,  and  their  calcu- 
ation  revealed  H 
lated rate constant matched well with their experimental data. Shi- 
ina  et  al.  [215]  later  conducted  a  shock  tube  study  at  relatively 
low temperatures (900–1150 K) on the reverse reaction to obtain 
an upper limit of  the dissociation rate  constant, and reported it 
over  90 0–360 0  K  by  using  the  results  from  their  earlier  study 
[214] . They also concluded that the recombination (reverse) reac- 
2 S + M ) was too slow and may require pressure 
tion (H 
above 120 bar at 900 K to take place. Karan et al. [104] studied H 
2 S 
decomposition in a quartz ﬂow reactor at 800–1250 °C with 0.2–2 
mol% H 
2 S in feed, and their rate constant fell in line with those 
reported by Woiki and Roth [212] and Olschewski et al. [213] . They 
also found the decomposition to be ﬁrst order with respect to H 
2 S 
concentration. A comparison of the reported rate constants in the 
above studies are shown in Fig. 6 a. Note that only the rate con- 
stants, proposed by Woiki and Roth [212] and in the studies con- 
ducted after that, have been shown in the ﬁgure, since the previ-

Fig. 6.  Comparison of experimental and calculated rate constants for (a) H 2 S + M → H 2 + S , and (b) H 2 + S (cid:2) HS + H . In (a), the rate constants were obtained from Woiki 
and Roth [212] , Olschewski et al. [213] , Shiina et al. [214,215] , and Karan et al. [104] , while in (b), the rate constants were obtained from Woiki and Roth [218] , Shiina et al. 
[214,215] , Maiti et al. [220] , and Thompson et al. [221] . 

ous rates constants were erroneously evaluated with the assump- 
2 S + M → H + HS + M in the model. A comparison of the ear- 
tion of H 
lier rates is already shown in [104,215] . As shown in Fig. 6 a, while 
the rate constants from Woiki and Roth [212] and Olschewski et al. 
[213] match very well, the values were slightly higher as compared 
to those found by Shiina et al. [214] . The low-temperature rates by 

Karan et al. [104] followed the trends of the previously reported 
rates at high temperatures. Thus, they also provided a rate con- 
stant to be valid over a wide temperature range of 1073–3300 K 
by ﬁtting through the rate constant data from [104,212,213] . The 
rate constant proposed by Shiina et al. [215] over a temperature 
range  of  90 0–360 0  K  is  lower  than  the  others  at  all  tempera-

The  bimolecular  reaction  of  the  products  of  H 

tures.  They  had  calculated  it  using  the  Troe’s  formula  with  the 
ab initio threshold energy for the intersystem crossing and using 
the  collision  factor  derived  from  the  experimental  rate  constant 
for this reaction from their earlier study [214] . Their rate is used 
2 S reaction mechanisms [216,217] . While it is 
commonly in the H 
established that  H 
2 S  decomposition  occurs  through  the  reaction, 
2 + S + M via intersystem crossing, the observed discrep- 
H 
ancies in its rate constant indicate that further experimental and 
theoretical studies on its kinetics are still needed. It is worth men- 
tioning that while this reaction helps in the initial dissociation of 
2 S during its pyrolysis, it is a slow reaction, and the further de- 
H 
composition of H 
2 S takes place through its reactions with various 
radical species such as H, S, and SH once they are generated [210] . 
2 S  dissociation, 
2 + S has also intrigued researchers over a long time. Woiki 
i.e., H 
and Roth [218] were the ﬁrst ones to report the high-temperature 
2 + S → H + HS  reaction  through  a  shock  tube 
rate  constant  for  H 
study  at  1257–3137  K  and  0.9–1.4  bar,  though  no  discussion  on 
other  possible  products  of  this  addition  reaction  was  provided. 
Shiina et al. [214] showed through a theoretical ( ab-initio MRCI + Q 
calculations)  and  experimental  (using  shock  tube  and  infrared 
2 S was not a favorable product 
emission spectroscopy) study that H 
of  their  addition,  and  they  form  H + HS,  but  the  reaction  may 
2 S ∗ occurring below the energy 
undergo through an intermediate H 
of H + HS. The rate constant for the overall reaction was provided. 
Tsuchiya et al. [219] found the triplet potential energy surface for 
this reaction through MRSDCI calculations, and concluded that the 
activation energy of this reaction was very close to its endother- 
micity, indicating a late barrier. Though not shown through calcu- 
lations, it was mentioned that there is a possibility of this reaction 
to go through entropically less-favored intersystem crossing. Shiina 
2 + S reaction by conducting experiments 
et al. [215] revisited the H 
at 910–1050 K and 0.4–4.2 atm in a shock tube, and reached the 
same  conclusion  as  before  that  the  insertion  channel  leading  to 
2 S  was  still  a  minor  one,  and  H + HS  was  the  leading  product 
H 
channel,  since  the  preexponential  factor  of  their  measured  rate 
2 + S reaction appeared too high for a spin forbidden 
constant for H

2 + S → H + HS  reactions.  To  provide 
for  H 
further  insight  into  this  reaction,  Maiti  et  al.  [220]  conducted  a 
theoretical study using trajectory surface hopping method to ﬁnd 
the  potential  energy  surface  and  show  that  the  reaction  went 
through a SH 
2  complex on the singlet surface, though their esti- 
mated rate constant at 10 0 0 K was very low as compared to the 
experimental value that suggested further studies on this reaction. 
Thompson et al. [221] provided a contour plot of potential energy 
2  complex by varying H-S and H –H coordinates to 
surface for HS 
determine the location of the transition state, and calculated the 
2 + S → H + SH  using  ring  polymer 
rate  constant  of  the  reaction,  H 
molecular dynamics (RPMD) and canonical variational transition- 
state theory (CVT). However, the rates were determined using only 
the triplet potential energy surface. They also conducted experi- 
ments  using  laser  ﬂash  photolysis—resonance  ﬂuorescence  tech- 
nique in a reactor to determine the rate constant for the above re- 
action at 600–1110 K. Their experimental rates were in agreement 
with the previously reported rates at higher temperatures. At tem- 
peratures lower than 10 0 0 K, the calculated rate constants were 
lower than the experimental ones by nearly an order of magnitude 
even after accounting for the quantum tunneling effect, which led 
to the conclusion that intersystem crossing cannot be neglected to 
improve the prediction of the rate constant at low temperatures. 
Fig.  6 b  compares  the  rate  constants  proposed  in  the  literature 
2 + S → H + SH.  The  calculated  rate  constants  by 
for  the  reaction,  H 
Maiti  et  al. [220]  and  Thompson  et  al.  [221]  are  lower  than  the 
experimental  rate  constants  by  Shiina  et  al.  [214,215]  and  those 
found by Thomson et al. [221] at low temperatures. As indicated 

2 + S  +  M  and  H

above, this underprediction by the theoretical rate constants in the 
literature at low temperatures calls for further investigations that 
can account for intersystem crossing in ﬁnding the rate constant.

Some  of  the  earlier  works  on  determining  the  rate  constants 
for sulfur related reactions involved understanding the interaction

through  which  SO 
atoms (possibly through the reactions, H + SO 
2 + M and 
HSO 
2 ),  theoretical  investigations  were  conducted 
using  MP2/3  and  MP4  levels  of  theory  to  obtain  the  reaction 
2 .  A  high  energy 
kinetics  for  the  interaction  between  H  and  SO 
barrier  for  H  and  SO 
2  addition  was  found  that  could  explain 
the  absence  of  the  reaction  between  the  two  at  temperatures 
< 500 K. The calculated rate constants for the elementary reac- 
tions,  H + SO 
2 ,  and 
HOSO → OH + SO  were  provided.  Since  then,  a  variety  of  studies 
have been conducted on this reaction with other levels of theory 
(e.g.  MP2/DZP  [223]  and  CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV( T  +  d )Z  [224–226] ), 
where  new  barriers  for  the  involved  reactions  have  been  found 
to  suggest  that  OH + SO  is  the  likely  product  of  their  addition. 
Murakami et al. [227] presented a shock-tube study to determine 
the rate constant for this reaction ( H + SO 
2 → products) in the tem- 
perature range of 140 0–220 0 K. Their rate constant was in close 
agreement with the one calculated by solving master equation by 
Hughes  et  al.  [228] .  Blitz  et  al.  [229]  revisited  this  reaction  and 
presented an experimental and theoretical investigation to propose 
a  new  rate  constant  for  this  reaction.  The  experimental  kinetics 
found using laser ﬂash photolysis and laser induced ﬂuorescence 
for the reaction, H + SO 
2  at 295–423 K was used to reﬁne 
the  master  equation  model  and  obtain  a  new  rate  constant  for 
H + SO 
2 → OH + SO.  In  [230] ,  the  rate  constants  for  this  overall  re- 
action was calculated using quasi classical trajectory (QCT) theory 
considering the internal energy of the reactants at 140 0–220 0 K. 
The  reaction  was  found  to  be  mainly  taking  place  through  the 
intermediate, HOSO. The rate constants from the above-mentioned 
studies are presented in Fig. 7 , where all the recent studies seem 
to agree with each other, with the estimated values found using 
experimental data from Jourdain et al. [231] and the equilibrium 
constant in [228] overpredicting the rate constant. 

2 (cid:3)HSO 

The kinetics of the reverse reaction, OH + SO → H + SO 

2 was ﬁrst 
studied experimentally in [232] , where the rate constant at 298 K 
and 1 Torr was reported by studying the reactions of H, H 
2 S, and 
O 
2  in  a  discharge  ﬂow  system.  Jourdain  et  al.  [231]  conducted 
a  similar  study  to  report  a  new  rate  constant  for  this  reaction, 
which was only slightly lower than the one reported in [232] . A 
temperature-dependent rate constant was provided by Blitz et al. 
[233] by studying this reaction using laser ﬂash photolysis coupled 
to a laser induced ﬂuorescence device at 295–703 K and 100 Torr. 
The  rate  constants  showed  a  negative  temperature  dependence 
and were pressure-independent, which were explained using the 
ab initio potential energy surface reported in [234] . The reaction 
proceeded  with  HOSO  and  HSO 
2  as  intermediates.  The  kinetics 
of  this  reaction  was  calculated  theoretically  by  Ballester  et  al. 
[235,236] using CASPT2 method. Fig. 8 provides a comparison of 
the  calculated  rate  constants  for  this  reaction  with  the  experi- 
mentally reported ones, as presented in [236] . The calculated and 
the experimental rate constants are in close agreement, and the 
temperature  dependence  of  the  rate  constant  is  rather  weak.  A 
sudden and unexpected decrease in the rate constant after 500 K, 
experimentally observed in [233] , was not seen in the calculated 
rates. This was attributed to the fact that Ballester et al. [235] did 
not  observe  the  formation  of  HSO 
2 ,  and  the  reaction  proceeded 
via HOSO as an intermediate, while Blitz et al. [233] considered 
both the intermediates and their interconversion to ﬁnd the rate

of studies in the literature on a single species (HOSO or HSO 
2 ) is 
because of its importance as an intermediate in the atmospheric 
and combustion chemistry of sulfurous compounds. 

3.3.3. H –H 2 S reactions 

Fig. 9 presents a comparison of the literature based experimen- 
2 S with the calculated 
tal rate constants for the reaction of H and H 
ones. The experiments to determine the rate constants for this re- 

action were ﬁrst conducted in 1970 by Cupitt and Glass [237] us- 
ing a fast discharge ﬂow system at 295 K. This was followed by 
a study by Kurylo et al. [238] using ﬂash photolysis coupled with 
resonance ﬂuorescence, where the rate constant was obtained over 
a range of temperature (190 – 464 K). Their rate was in agreement 
with the one reported in [237] , but didn’t match well with the one 
found in [239] using a ﬂow system with mass spectrometric detec- 
tion, and the difference was attributed only to the difference in the 
experimental techniques used [239] . Roth et al. [126] conducted a

tometry to determine the high-temperature rate constant for this 
reaction over 1965–2560 K. Yoshimura et al. [240] also provided 
the high-temperature measurements of the rate constants over a 
range of 1053–2237 K and at 298 K using a shock tube and laser 
photolysis, and the rate constant was validated by calculating it us- 
ing PMP4(SDTQ)6–311G ∗∗//MP2/6–31G ∗∗ level of theory. The most 
recent experimental kinetics for this reaction is from Peng et al. 
[241] ,  where  the  kinetics  information  using  ﬂash-photolysis  res- 
onance  ﬂuorescence  technique  in  the  intermediate  temperature 
range (298–598 K) was provided that was missing in the earlier 
studies. They also estimated the rate constant using QCISD(T)/6–
311 + G (3df,2p)  that  matched  well  with  their  experimentally- 
obtained kinetics. A good match up to a temperature of 10 0 0 K 
between  the  calculated  kinetics  and  the  experimental  data  from 
this work and from the literature was found, but the theory over- 
estimated the rate constant, possibly due to the nonvariational na- 
ture of the transition state theory used in this work. Later, in [242] , 
the rate was calculated using QCISD(T,full)/cc-pVTZ and variational 
transition  state  theory  over  a  wider  range  of  temperature  (100–
2500  K)  and  validated  with  the  experimental  data  from  the  lit- 
erature and the estimated kinetics from the previous studies. For 
the same reaction, more accurate potential energy surfaces have 
been found in the recent studies [243,244] using quantum dynam- 
ics, and quasi-classical trajectory methods have been employed to 
study the multi-channel addition of H and H 
2 S. The non-Arrhenius 
behavior of the rate constant at low temperatures, as observed in 
experiments, was found to be due to quantum tunneling. 

As seen in Fig. 9 , the close agreement between most of the ex- 
perimental data and the calculated rates indicate that the pathway 
for  this  reaction  and  the  energetics  are  well  understood.  Some 
differences in the calculated rate constants are mainly due to the 
difference in the theories used for calculations. In particular, the 
high  temperature  rate  constant  from  Roth  et  al.  [126]  disagreed 
with all the theoretically determined rates as well with the exper- 
imental data from Yoshimura et al. [240] at similar temperatures. 
Roth et al. had found the rate constant using steady-state concen- 
tration of H atom, and their rate constant depends on the accuracy 

of the rate constant for H 
2 S dissociation as well as H concentration 
at  the  steady-state.  In  comparison,  the  experimentally  obtained 
rate by Yoshimura et al. is more reliable, since it was measured di- 
rectly under the pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions and the calculations 
were independent of H-atom concentration. 

3.3.4. O –H 2 S reactions 

One  of  the  early  experimental  studies  on  the  reactions  of  O 
2 S to form OH and HS was conducted by Hollinden et al. 
and H 
[246]  in  the  temperature  range  of  205  to  300  K  using  electron 
spin  resonance  approach  in  a  ﬂow  tube  immersed  in  dry  ice 
(for  measurements  below  room  temperature).  The  rate  constant 
2 S ratio at stoichiometry of 
was determined by assuming an O/H 
3.5  considering  some  side  reactions  that  can  consume  O  atoms. 
Whytock  et  al.  [247]  studied  this  reaction  at  slightly  higher 
temperatures  of  263–495  K  using  ﬂash  photolysis  coupled  with 
resonance ﬂorescence technique, and their rate constants matched 
well  with  the  previously  reported  ones.  Moreover,  they  did  not 
observe  any  signiﬁcant  pressure  dependence  of  the  reaction 
kinetics.  Their  results  indicated  the  H-abstraction  mechanism 
to  be  dominant,  but  did  not  completely  rule  out  the  addition 
reaction. Slagle et al. [248] studied the kinetics of this reactions 
at 250–500 K using a variable-temperature fast-ﬂow reactor cou- 
pled to a photoionization mass spectrometer, and suggested that 
the  alternative  routes,  e.g.,  via  addition  of  the  reactants  may  be 
possible.  Singleton  et  al.  [249]  tried  to  resolve  this  confusion  in 
the mechanism of the reaction between O and H 
2 S by conducting 
quantitative gas chromatographic analysis, though the study was 
not entirely conclusive and they reported that about 52–100% of O 
and H 
2 S may be reacting through H-abstraction channel. Agrawalla 
et al. [250] revisited this reaction using an afterglow reactor along 
with  infrared  chemiluminescence  and  laser-induced  ﬂuorescence 
techniques to obtain the rate constant at 300 K. While they con- 
cluded that H-abstraction may be the main channel, the addition 
reactions leading to HSO + H could also not be ruled out. Another 
room  temperature  study  by  Horie  et  al.  [251]  using  a  discharge 
ﬂow  system  with  mass  spectrometric  detection  and  stationary 
photolysis experiments found a rate constant similar to the pre-

vious  studies,  but  with  no  new  information  on  the  mechanism. 
The  study  by  Tsuchiya  et  al.  [252]  was  one  of  the  early  studies 
on the high-temperature (110 0–20 0 0 K) measurement of the rate 
constant of this reaction, where a shock-tube with laser photolysis 
was used together with atomic resonance absorption spectroscopy. 
They  reported  the  branching  fraction  for  the  substitution  chan- 
nel  ( O  +  H 
2 S  (cid:3) H + HSO)  relative  to  the  abstraction  one  to  be 
0.2 ± 0.1 that matched well with the prediction from transition 
state theory. The oxidation initiation reaction for H 
2 S was further 
studied theoretically using singlet [253] and triplet O atoms [254] , 
where  the  formation  of  the  possible  products  (OH + HS,  HSO + H , 
2 O,  and  HOS + H )  were  explored  using  MP2  and 
H 
G2  calculations.  In  [254] ,  the  study  of  the  branching  ratio  indi- 
cated that the formation of OH + HS would be the dominant one 
among the possible product channels. Their rate constants were in 
close  agreement  with  the  experimentally  observed  kinetics  from 
[255] at temperatures above 10 0 0 K. In [256] , a low temperature 
dynamics  study  was  presented  using  MP2(fc)/6–311G(3df,3pd) 
level of theory to study the formation of OH and HS, and the role 
of quantum mechanical tunneling was highlighted. A reﬁnement 
to the reaction kinetics was brought by Wang et al. [197] , where 
a  higher  level  of  theory  (QCISD(T)/6–311CCG(2df,2pd)//QCISD/6–
311CG(d,p)) was used for the kinetics calculation in the range of 
205–20 0 0  K,  and  as  shown  in  Fig.  10 ,  a  good  agreement  with 
the rates from experimental studies reported above was found at 
temperatures  above  300  K,  when  the  tunneling  correction  using 
the small curvature tunneling method was taken into account. 

3.3.5. H 2 S-O 2 and HS-O 2 interactions 

2 SO 

2 S,  that  is  H 

In  [257] ,  Montoya  et  al.  presented  a  detailed  study  on  the 
initiation  reaction  for  the  combustion  of  H 
2 S-O 
2 
reactions,  using  G2  and  B3LYP/6–311 + G (3df,2p)  levels  of  theory. 
The  adduct  (H 
2 ),  formed  from  their  addition,  was  reported 
to  have  seven  isomers  that  were  sulfoxylic  acid,  sulﬁnic  acid, 
dihydrogen sulfone, peroxide, thiadioxirane, and superoxide. These 
2 + HS, 
intermediates eventually led to various products such as HO 
HSO + OH, SO + H 
2 + H 
2 .  The formation of the products, 
HS + HO 
2 was most likely due to low energy barrier involved in it. 
The variational transition state theory was used to evaluate its rate 
constant over a temperature range of 30 0–30 0 0 K. The reactions of 

2 O, and SO 

2 → H 

2 S + O 

2 S + 3 O 

2 → HS + HO 

HS with O 
2 was, thus, important for combustion propagation. Prior 
to this study, Frenklach et al. [127] had conducted a shock tube 
2 S oxidation, where a ﬁxed value for the rate constant 
study on H 
of  the  reaction,  HS + HO 
2 S + O 
2  was  suggested  through  trial 
and error to match the modelling results with the experimental 
data  on  ignition  delay  times.  The  rate  constant  for  the  reaction, 
H 
2 was improved by Zhou et al. [115] , where mul- 
tireference  CASSCF/6–31G(d,p)  level  of  theory  (with  single  point 
energy  calculations  using  MRCI + Davidson/aug-cc-pV( T  +  d )Z) 
was used. It was mentioned that Montoya et al. [257] underpre- 
dicted the energy barrier with G2 level of theory that led to an 
overestimation  of  the  rate  constant.  Starik  et  al.  [258]  studied 
H 
2 S  oxidation  by  singlet  and  triplet  oxygen.  They  mentioned 
that Montoya et al. did not account for the correction associated 
with  the  treatment  of  the  torsion  mode  as  internal  rotator  for 
the  transition  state  structure  (instead,  the  harmonic  oscillator 
approximation  was  used)  that  also  led  to  an  overestimation  of 
the rate constant. For the reaction, H 
2 , Starik et 
al. presented a new rate constant using UMP2/6–31G(d) level of 
theory, whose value was lower than those by Montoya et al. and 
Zhou et al. at high temperatures. In spite of these effort s, Mathieu 
et  al.  [96] ,  in  a  recent  work  involving  the  development  of  H 
2 S 
reaction mechanism, had to manually vary the rate constant of this 
reaction to predict the experimental data on ignition delay of H 
2 S 
oxidation.  Therefore, Wang  et  al.  [259]  attempted  to  resolve  the 
discrepancies related to the kinetics of this reaction by conducting 
computational  study  using  various  theories  (CCSD,  CASPT2,  DFT, 
and  composite  methods).  Fig.  11  compares  the  reaction  kinet- 
ics,  calculated  with  single-reference  (CCSD)  and  multireference 
(CASPT2) methods by Wang et al. [259] with the literature-based 
kinetics  discussed  above.  Their  rate  constant,  calculated  using 
CCSD(T), is within a factor of 3 of that proposed by Starik et al. 
at  temperatures  above  500  K,  and  near  to  the  rate  constant  for 
this reaction required by Mathieu et al. to be able to predict their 
2 S mechanism. This 
experimental observations using the detailed H 
may indicate that CCSD(T) rate constant for this reaction is possi- 
bly the best estimation available so far, though modelling studies 
including the new rate constant for this reaction are required to 
conﬁrm  this.  Moreover,  a  large  difference  in  the  rate  constant

methods was observed at low temperatures, and it was concluded 
that  further  advanced  experimental  studies  on  its  kinetics  and 
multi-reference  coupled-cluster  calculations  on  this  reaction  are 
needed in the future for the further reﬁnement in its kinetics. 

The  reactions  of  HS  radical  and  O 

2 + H ,  SO + OH,  HSO + O ,  and  S + HO 

2  can  follow  four  possible 
product  channels:  SO 
2  [260] . 
The  kinetics  of  their  reaction  was  studied  experimentally  in 
[261] through H 
2 S photodissociation and the measurements of the 
concentrations of SH radicals, where the upper limit of the rate 
constant  was  reported  at  298  K,  though  no  information  on  the 
possible  products  was  provided.  Tsuchiya  et  al.  [262]  conducted 
shock  tube  experiments  with  laser  photolysis  to  determine  the 
rate  constant  for  the  reaction  of  SH  and  O 
2 .  Though  the  most 
probable product could not be found with certainty, their reaction 
was assumed to be forming HSO and O and the rate constant for 
it was provided at 1398–1847 K. Goumri et al. [263] studied the 
2  to  form  HSO  and  O  (via 
interaction  between  HS  radical  and  O 
an  intermediate,  HSOO)  and  the  interaction  between  H  and  SO 
2 
using  MP2 = FULL/6–31G(d),  and  provided  the  rate  constants  of 
the reactions using RRKM theory. They assumed that there is no 
energy barrier for the adduct HSOO to form HSO and O. Based on 
this assumption, they found the rate constant for HS + O 
2 (cid:3)HSO + O . 
Later,  in  [264] ,  an  investigation  on  the  reactions  between  SH 
and  O 
2  was  conducted  by  Resende  et  al.  using  MP2/ccpVTZ  to 
understand its importance at low temperatures. The reaction was 
reported  to  be  too  slow  to  be  signiﬁcant  at  low  temperature  in 
the atmosphere, and the adduct, HSOO would most likely lead to 
SO + OH, a product channel different from the previous studies. The 
high-temperature  kinetics  were  not  provided.  In  [265] ,  Ballester 
et  al.  studied  the  reactions  of  HS  and  O 
2  to  ﬁnd  the  minimum 
potential  energy  surfaces  using  Quasi-classical  trajectory  method 
to  form  HSO + O  and  H + SO 
2 ,  and  reported  the  rate  constant  for 
the addition reaction in the temperature range of 20 0–20 0 0 K. Fig. 
12  presents  a  comparison  of  the  experimental  and  theoretically 
calculated  rates  for  HS  and  O 
2  reaction.  The  rate  constant  by 
Ballester et al. matched well with the experimental rate constants 
reported previously in the literature. They concluded that HSO + O 
was  possibly  the  major  product  for  the  addition  reaction.  Zhou 

et  al.  [260]  have  provided  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  possible 
2 .  The  potential 
product  channels  of  the  reaction  of  SH  with  O 
2 + S , HSO + O , and SO + OH 
energy diagrams for the formation of HO 
were obtained using multireference methods (CASSCF/cc-pVTZ and 
MRCI + Davidson/aug  ccpV( Q  +  d )Z//CASSCF/cc-pVTZ).  It  was  de- 
termined from the kinetic analysis that, at low temperatures, the 
formation of SO + OH dominates, which agrees with the ﬁndings of 
[264] , while at high temperatures, two product channels leading to 
HSO + O and SO + OH had comparable kinetics, and both would be 
important. The rate constants presented in this work were nearly 
an order of magnitude lower than those reported in the previous 
studies by Tsuchiya et al. and Goumri et al. [262,263] . They argued 
that  Goumri  et  al.  had  over-estimated  the  rate  constant  due  to 
the  variational  treatment  of  a  loose  transition  state  involved  in 
the addition reaction. Moreover, the multireference character from 
the near-degenerate conﬁgurations for doublet and quartet states 
for  the  reaction,  HSOO (cid:3)HSO + O  cannot  be  accurately  estimated 
at  G2  level  of  theory  that  was  used  by  Goumri  et  al.  Similar 
shortcomings  in  other  previous  studies  such  as  the  use  of  sin- 
gle  reference  methods  were  highlighted  by  Zhou  et  al.  [260]  to 
explain  the  difference  in  their  rate  constants  with  the  previous 
studies and the contradictions in the rate constants from different 
theoretical studies. Garrido et al. [266] conducted a CASPT2 study 
2 + H . Their 
on HSO 
rate for the reaction, as presented in [98] and Fig. 12 , is higher 
than  that  from  Zhou  et  al.  While  there  is  some  indication  from 
the earlier studies that HSO + O and OH + SO could be the impor- 
tant  product  channels,  uncertainties  in  the  rate  constants  and 
the  important  product  channels  still  remain  and  require  further 
investigation.

It is shown in [118,257] that H 

2 S oxidation begins with HS for- 
mation and eventually leads to SO and SO 
2  formation. However, 
when the oxidation takes place with low concentration of air (this 
is  the  case  with  most  Claus  furnaces,  where  only  partial  oxida- 
tion  of  H 
2  that  in  turn  reacts  with  the 
2 S to form elemental sulfur), the disulfur species be- 
remaining H

HSSH to be playing an important role in the formation of the de- 
sired products, especially, S 
2 . In [216] , the formation and the de- 
struction of disulfur species (HSSH and HSS) were studied using G2 
and CASSCF/6–31G(d), and the kinetics of 13 reversible reactions 
involving their breakage on collision with a third body and their 
reactions with H, S, and SH to form various products (H 
2 , H, S, SH, 
2 S) were provided. In [269] , the study was extended to 
S 
2 , and H 
further understand the interaction between H 
2 S and S that could 
lead  to  disulfur  species  along  with  the  other  products  (SH + SH, 
2 )  using  MRCI/aug-cc-pVTZ  and 
H 
MRCI + Davidson/aug-ccpV( Q + d )Z levels of theory. It was reported 
that  the  species,  HSSH  barrierlessly  gives  SH + SH  and  HSS + H  as 
products (with the former one being lower in energy than the lat- 
ter one and also being the preferred product at high temperatures). 
In Zhou et al. [270] , the reactions of disulfur species were revisited 
to ﬁnd other possible products using MRC/aug-cc-pVTZ//MRCI/aug- 
cc-pV( Q + d )Z and CASSCF/aug-cc-pVTZ. Fig. 13 presents the po- 
tential  energy  diagrams  of  the  key  reactions  involving  disulfur 
species. The unimolecular decomposition of HSSH to form SH + SH, 
2 S + S , and 
HSS + H , and H 
2 + H 
S 
2 were studied, and the rate constants were computed. Vari- 
ous bimolecular reactions and the reactions involving a third body 
2 S + S  +  M (cid:3)HSSH + M )  along 
(2SH + M (cid:3)HSSH + M ,  2SH (cid:3)H 
2 S + S ,  H 
with the reactions of HSS + H to form 2SH, H 
2 were 
also studied. The kinetic simulations indicated that the reactions of 
SH + SH would mainly form HSSH that decomposes at high temper- 
atures to primarily form HSS + H with a small amount of H 
2 S + S . 
During  the  reactions  of  H 
2 S  and  S,  at  low  temperatures,  HSSH 
was formed, while at high temperatures, two SH molecules were 
mainly  formed  along  with  a  small  amount  of  HSS + H .  The  reac- 
tion of HSS and H provided 2SH as the main product. In Gao et 
al. [271] , the kinetics of the reactions of H 
2 S and S atom was car- 
ried out experimentally using laser photolysis–resonance ﬂuores- 
2 S and

S reactions were revisited in their work. The high levels of the- 
ory (DKCCSD(T)/cc-PVQZ_DK and MRCI) were used for studying the 
potential energy surface, and the rate constants for the reactions, 
2 S + S (cid:3)SH + SH  were 
H 
provided. It was observed through the analysis of the singlet and 
triplet energy surfaces that the most probable product of their in- 
teraction at combustion conditions (temperatures above 10 0 0 K) is 
the abstraction channel leading to two SH molecules. In Wei et al. 
[272] , the reaction, H + S 
2 (cid:3)HS + S was studied using quantum dy- 
namics method, where they observed the reaction to go through an 
intermediate, HSS. The rate constant for this reaction was provided, 
where a negative temperature dependence was observed at very 
high temperatures ( > 40 0 0 K). Overall, the rate constant was also 
found to be too low due to a high energy barrier to be signiﬁcant 
in combustion environment. Zhou et al. [131] studied the oxida-

and O 
concentration of SH increases and that of O decreases, the reac- 
tion of SH to form HSSH and HSS becomes important. The species, 
HSS and HSSH was found to be important even in the oxygen-rich 
environment. They played a key role in chain termination through 
2 S + HSS, and

and  theoretically  using  CCSD(T)  level  of  theory.  While  at  low

temperatures, the formation of the adduct (CS 
channel, at higher temperatures, the abstraction channel involving 
the  formation  of  S 
2  and  CS  became  important.  Glarborg  et  al. 
[274] presented one of the ﬁrst studies, where the reactions for 
CS 
2  formation  and  oxidation  were  gathered  from  the  literature,

different reactors such as batch reactors, ﬂow reactors, and shock 
tubes. An earlier study [275] had also attempted to present a de- 
tailed reaction mechanism for CS 
2 oxidation, which could predict 
some experimental observation, but did not work well with all the 
experimental  data  available,  and  the  authors  found  that  further 
mechanism veriﬁcation and reﬁnement was necessary. Therefore, 
several CS x  reactions were also studied in the work by Glarborg 
2 ,  and CS + SO using 
et  al.  [274] such  as CS 
W1U and CBS-QB3 methods that improved the prediction of the 
experimental  data  in  various  reactors  with  the  newly  developed 
2  reaction  mechanism.  Fig.  14  presents  the  potential  energy

reaction formed COS and S. The major species generated from CS

2 with O atom 
oxidation were CS, CO, and COS. The reaction of CS 
is also important in the CS 
2 mechanism, where CS and SO are the 
main products. This reaction was studied in detail in [276] , though 
the reaction kinetics provided in this paper were considered less 
reliable  by  Glarborg  et  al.  [274] ,  as  the  singlet-triplet  coupling 
on  the  potential  energy  surface  was  not  considered,  and  the 
reactions  were  analyzed  with  triplet  spin  multiplicity  only.  The 
intermediate  species,  CS  oxidizes  to  form  CO  and  COS,  and  the 
further reactions of COS are highlighted in the next section. The 
reactions of CS 
2 were further investigated by Glarborg et al. [277] , 
where the temperature and pressure dependence of the reaction,

its predictive capability. The potential energy surfaces for CS

They  revised  the  rate  constants  for  these  reactions  by  including 
the singlet-triplet coupling, and found that it improved the model 
prediction for CS

2  were explored 
at temperatures up to 600 K using B3LYP/cc-pV(T + d)Z and W1 
methods, and the species HSCS was found to be the main product 
of their addition. 

3.3.8. COS reactions 

The  species,  COS,  being  one  of  the  intermediates  during  CS 
2 
oxidation, has gathered signiﬁcant attention in the literature, and a 
number of experimental and theoretical studies highlights different 
reactions related to its oxidation and reduction. In one of the ear- 
lier studies [185] , the formation of COS with relevance to Claus fur- 
2 S to form 
nace was studied, where the reaction between CO and H 
COS was considered. It was reported that CO can react with H 
2 S or 
HS to form COS + H x or with S atom (formed from H 
2 S decompo- 
sition) to lead to COS formation. Based on the experimental obser- 
vation of species proﬁles, the rate constants for COS and CO forma- 
tion were derived to formulate a kinetic model for COS. Later, some 
high temperature studies were conducted using ab-initio methods 
to  ﬁnd the reactions for the formation and oxidation of COS. In 
[286] , the reactions of COS and O atom were explored using exper- 
imental (excimer laser photolysis shock tube technique) and theo- 
retical (G2M and B3LYP) methods. The product branching ratio of 
2 + S and CO + SO was calculated. The experimental results were 
CO 
found to be consistent with the predictions from a model devel- 
oped using theoretically calculated kinetics. In [287] , the reactions 
2 + CO and SO + CS were studied experimen- 
of S and COS to form S 
tally in the temperature range of 298 to 985 K, and theoretically 
using G2M and B3LYP methods. While at high temperatures, the 
2 and CO were dominant, at low temperatures and 
formation of S 
high pressures, the adduct OCS 
2 was stable. The reactions of COS 
with O, H, and OH were further studied by Saheb et al. [288] using 
ab-initio and density functional theories (DFT). The rates estimated 
with W1BD and CBS-QB3 levels of theory were found to be in line 
with the available experimental data. The results showed that the 

reaction of H atom with COS was the fastest chemical sink for COS 
degradation under the conditions examined. Fig. 16 presents the 
kinetics of H + COS (cid:3)CO + SH reaction found by Saheb et al. that are 
compared with the experimental kinetics from [289] (where the 
reaction was studied using ﬂash photolysis–resonance ﬂuorescence 
technique over the temperature range 261 to 500 K), [290] (where 
mercury photosynthesized decomposition of H 
2 was conducted to 
study this reaction at 300–525 K), and [239] (where a ﬂow reactor 
coupled to mass spectroscopy was used to study the kinetics of 
this reaction at 298 K). A good match between the computed and 
experimental  kinetics  can  be  seen.  Saheb  et  al.  also  presented 
the rate constants for O + COS forming CO + SO and CO 
2 + S , though 
they  did  not  consider  singlet-triplet  coupling.  While  there  are  a 
signiﬁcant  number  of  experimental  studies  [286,291–298]  and 
theoretical  calculations  [286,288,299]  on  the  kinetics  of  their 
reaction,  there  is  a  scatter  of  data  on  the  branching  fraction 
for  the  O + COS  reaction  [300] .  Glarborg  et  al.  [300]  presented  a 
detailed study on the mechanism development for COS oxidation 
by borrowing the reaction kinetics information from the literature, 
which  was  validated  using  a  series  of  lab-scale  data  from  batch 
reactors, ﬂow reactors, and shock tubes. The reaction mechanism 
for  oxidation  was  analyzed.  A  key  reaction  for  COS  dissociation 
was  COS + M (cid:3)CO + S  +  M ,  for  which  the  available  kinetics  data 
are plotted in Fig. 17 . A number of shock tube studies [149,301–
304] and a reactor study over 823–873 K [305] have provided the 
kinetics parameter for COS dissociation, and a ﬁt through the data, 
as  recommended  by  Oya  et  al.  [304] ,  was  used  in  [300] .  It  was 
found that the most likely products for COS dissociation and its 
reactions with important radical species such as O and S would be 
CO x  and S y  due to strong bonding between C and O in COS that 
is diﬃcult to break to form reduced species such as CS 
2 . It was 
highlighted that the reaction mechanism could be improved with 
better predictions of the rate constants for COS reactions with O 
and  S  radicals.  The  modelling  results  on  COS  and  CS 
2  oxidation 
had similar ﬁndings on the important reactions for COS oxidation 
in [13] . For the further development of the reaction mechanism for 
COS oxidation and formation and to remove the estimated rate pa- 
rameters for COS and O reactions from the mechanism, Rahman et 
al. [306] conducted theoretical studies on the interaction between 
COS  and  S 
2 ,  COS  and  HS,  and  COS  and  O  using  CBS-QB3.  These 
reactions were found to be responsible for the underestimated COS 
concentration in the Claus furnace. For the COS and O interactions, 
both singlet and triplet surfaces were explored to ﬁnd the branch-

these COS reactions to the Claus mechanism, the model prediction

ferences with the plant data on COS still exist that points towards 
the need for the further development of its reaction mechanism.

3 S + OH,  CH 

The  commonly  studied  mercaptans  in  the  literature  include 
methyl and ethyl mercaptans. One of the early theoretical studies 
on  mercaptans  was  its  reaction  with  O  atom  [310]  that  was 
conducted to explain some of the previous experimental ﬁndings 
that  methyl  mercaptans  form  CH 
4 ,  and  H  during  ox- 
idation. The reactions of CH 
3 SH with O atom was studied using 
MP2  and  MP4  methods  to  ﬁnd  the  energetics  involved  in  the 
3 + HSO, 
formation  of  possible  products  such  as  CH 
3 SO + H . Their study indicated that the low energy barrier 
and CH 
3 S + OH  is  the  most  likely  product, 
for  H-abstraction  to  form  CH 
which explains the high concentrations of CH 
3  observed in 
3 SSCH 
experiments. Their reaction was revisited in [311] , where a higher 
level  of  theory  (CCSD(T)/CBS//(BB1K  or  MP2)/aug-cc-pV(T þd)Z) 
was  used  for  the  reaction  energetics  and  kinetics  calculations. 
2 SH + OH, 
Four  product  channels  were  considered:  CH 
3 SO + H .  By  analyzing  the  branching  ratio,  the 
CH 
most  likely  products  of  their  reactions  were  found  to  be  CH 
3 S 
and  OH.  Their  rate  constants  matched  well  with  the  previously 
reported experimental data from Slagle et al. [248] , Kirchner et al. 
[312] , and Nip et al. [313] , as shown in Fig. 19 . In [248] , variable-

though  it  was  not  very  conclusive  from  their  data.  A  similar 
technique  was  used  in  [312]  to study the  oxidation of various 
mercaptans  (RSH)  from  CH 
11 SH  over  a  temperature 
3 SH  to  C 
range of 303 to 417 K, and various products such as RS, RSR, RSSH,

intermediate reactions were also presented. They found that there

the  rate  constants  for  102  H-abstraction  reactions  by  CH

Thereafter,  the  reactions  of  H  atoms  with  thiols  and  sulﬁdes  to

CBS-QB3 and group additivity method. The rate constants for 94 
reactions were provided, and some of them were validated using 
experimental  data.  In  [318] ,  further  H-abstraction  reactions  from 
S-H and C –H containing species by S radicals were studied using 
CBS-QB3 and group additivity method, which are also relevant to 
sulfur  recovery  processes.  In  total,  159  reactions  were  analyzed 
and their rate constants were reported, where some of them had

In [306] , Rahman et al. modelled the SRU, where mercaptans 
can  be  present  in  the  feed  and  can  be  produced  in  the  furnace 
through  hydrocarbon  contaminants.  In  their  study,  CBS-QB3  was 
used to study the formation of methyl, ethyl, and propyl mercap- 
tans  from  methane,  ethane,  and  propane,  respectively,  through 
their  reactions  with  SH  radicals.  They  also  studied  the  growth 
of  methyl  mercaptan  in  the  furnace  through  its  reaction  with 
methyl  radicals  to  form  ethyl  mercaptan  and  dimethyl  sulﬁde.

Their  formation  was  supported  at  low  temperatures,  but  their 
destruction was favored in the furnace at high temperatures above

3 SH oxidation has been presented in [152] , where its oxidation 
CH 
mainly produced SO

adding the reactions from the above-highlighted studies together

still necessary to improve its predictive capability. Based on their

2 was suggested not to have any chemical effect 
in soot formation for concentrations below 40% in ﬂames, though 
its higher concentration reduced soot through chemical effects. In 
[327] , the effect of CS 
2  on soot emission was tested, and it was 
noted  that  it  reduced  signiﬁcantly  the  amount  of  soot  formed, 
possibly by acting as a radical scavenger. Some recent studies on 
soot-SO 
2 addition 
to a ﬂame can lead to soot reduction through the enhanced forma- 
tion of CS 
2 . The activation energy for the oxidation 
2  was  about  82  kJ/mol  that  is  signiﬁcantly  lower 
of  soot  by  SO 
2 ,  though  the  mechanism  of 
than  that  for  soot  oxidation  by  O 
2 is not well understood. During 
soot oxidation or reduction by SO

ethylene pyrolysis in the presence of SO 
2  (0.3%)  enhanced 
it  was  found  that,  while  small  amount  of  SO 
2 reduced both PAH and 
PAH formation, the higher amounts of SO 
soot  formation  from  ethylene.  The  effect  of  SO 
2  on  PAH  during 
ethylene  pyrolysis  has  further  been  tested  in  [111] , where  PAHs, 
oxygenated-PAHs and sulphurated-PAHs were detected, and their 
concentrations  increased  with  increasing  temperature  and  SO 
2 
concentration that highlights the chemical effects of the addition 
of SO 

2 on PAHs, and possibly, soot formation. 

In  Claus  furnace,  several  aromatic  species  (benzene,  toluene,

that  needs  to  be  oxidized  in  the  furnace  before  the  gases  enter

on the catalyst and cause their deactivation. In a series of studies

phenoxy,  benzyloxy,  or  xylyloxy  radicals.  Their  further  reactions 
lead to aromatics oxidation through the loss of CO. Through kinetic 
modeling [334] , it was shown that the reactions between aromatics 
2 played key roles in oxidizing them in the oxygen-deﬁcient 
and SO 
Claus furnace conﬁrming that SO 
2 can act as an oxidant. However, 
if we analyze all the studies reported above, it appears that it can 
act as an oxidant or a radical scavenger depending upon the fuel 
and the equivalence ratio. A modelling study is needed to ﬁnd the 
range in which it could be used as a potential oxidant for fuels. 

There have also been some kinetic studies on the interaction 
between  hydrocarbons  and  S  atoms.  For  example,  in  [335] ,  the 
reactions  between  acetylene  and  S  atom  were  explored  exper- 
imentally  using  laser  photolysis  method  and  theoretically  for 
adduct  formation  using  CBS-QB3.  The  equilibrium  constant  and 
kinetics  information  were  provided  using  experimental  data  and 
potential  energy  diagram  from  the  literature  [336,337] .  In  [338] , 
the  reactions  of  ethylene  and  S  atom  were  studied  experimen- 
tally  using  laser  photolysis  method  and  theoretically  using  the 
literature-reported  potential  energy  surface  [336] ,  and  the  rate 
constant  for  adduct  formation  was  provided.  The  studies  on  the 
reactions  highlighting  carbon-sulfur  interactions  are  limited,  and 
requires  further  attention  to  be  able  to  explain  the  formation 
2 ,  COS,  mercaptans,  and  other  organosulfur  compounds  in- 
of  CS 
cluding  sulfurated-aromatics  in  the  reactors  when  sulfur-bearing 
compounds and hydrocarbons are burnt together. 

3.3.11. Sulfur oxidation for energy applications 

Sulfur has been proposed in several studies to be used in ther- 
mochemical cycles to produce electricity using the heat energy lib- 
erated  from  its  combustion  or  for  water  splitting  to  get  H 
2  and 
O 
4  as an intermediate. Sulfur combustion is also of 
industrial importance due to its usage in producing sulfuric acid. 
These will be further described later, but such applications involve

3.3.10. Sulfur-carbon interactions 

While  most  lab-scale  experimental  studies  and  theoretical 
calculations have mainly focused on pure sulfurous compounds as 
highlighted above, the practical systems dealing with acid gas such 
as Claus furnace receive a mixture of gases as feed that include 
2 S,  hydrocarbons  (such  as  methane,  ethane,  propane,  benzene, 
H 
toluene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene), CO 

2 , and H 

2 O. 

3  and  SO 

3 + O (cid:3)SO 

One of the early and detailed investigations on the interaction 
between carbon and sulfur compounds was an experimental and 
2  mixture,  presented  in 
theoretical  study  on  fuel  (CO)  and  SO 
2  in  combustion  and  its  interactions 
[323] ,  where  the  role  of  SO 
with  radicals  such  as  H  and  OH  were  studied.  SO 
2  is  believed 
to  be  a  radical  sink.  However,  it  was  shown  through  theoretical 
calculations that its reaction with H to form HOSO and its reaction 
2  are less important at high temperatures, 
with OH to form HSO 
though it could act as a sink for O radicals through the reactions, 
2 + O (cid:3)SO 
2 + O

2 .  Under  very  lean  conditions, 
SO 
2  acted  as  scavenger  for  O  atoms  and  reduced  the  reaction 
rate of fuel, but at slightly lean conditions, it enhanced fuel oxi- 
2 + H (cid:3)SO + OH and 
dation by O and OH through the reactions, SO 
2 + O . Later, the kinetics of the reaction between CO and 
SO + O 
2  was studied theoretically [324] using G3//B3LYP theory, and 
SO 
2 was 
it was reported that the direct reaction between CO and SO 
not  important,  but  the  presence  of  impurities  such  as  H 
2 O, 
4 can signiﬁcantly affect the reaction kinetics, as they can 
and CH 
produce radicals such as OH, H, and O to accelerate the oxidation 
of CO and the decomposition of SO 
2 on 
2 ﬂame near and above stochiometric conditions was studied, 
CO/H 
and the inhibiting effect of SO 
2 through chain termination reaction 
( H + SO

3 , SOO, SSO, 
of S 
and  SSOO  were  considered  for  this  study,  and  reaction  energet- 
ics for their formation and decomposition were studied. The reac- 
tion kinetics of SO 
2  and O was evaluated. In 
[340] ,  a  reaction  mechanism  was  presented  for  the  oxidation  of 
2  in air consisting of 11 reactions, for which the rate constants 
S 
were borrowed from the literature. The sensitivity analysis of the 
reaction mechanism indicated that the reaction, S + O 
2 (cid:3)SO + O af- 
fected the laminar velocity of the S 
2 -air ﬂame the most. A review 
of the literature indicated that a good variation in the tempera- 
ture dependency of the rate constant for this reaction was present 
in the literature-based kinetics. Therefore, they revisited this reac- 
tion and conducted quantum calculations to determine the transi- 
tion states and the rate constants for this reaction. While different 
composite methods were tested, the kinetics obtained using CBS- 
QB3 was used in the mechanism due to the high reliability of the 
results obtained from it. Fig. 22 provides the potential energy dia- 
gram for the reaction along with the calculated rate constants us- 
ing singlet and triplet surfaces that are compared with the pre- 
viously reported kinetics, and a signiﬁcant difference can be seen 
between their results and the values existing in the literature. The 
early investigations on ﬁnding the experimental rate constants for 
this reaction at high temperatures include the shock tube studies 
of Saito et al. [148] (over a temperature range of 190 0–220 0 K), 
Woiki  et  al.  [341]  (at  1220–3460  K),  Tsuchiya  et  al.  [262]  (at 
980–1610 K), where atomic resonance absorption spectroscopy was 
used.  Lu  et  al.  [342]  conducted  an  experimental  and  theoretical 
study and their rate constants agreed well with the previously re- 
ported kinetics. For theoretical calculations, G2M(RCC2)//B3LYP/6–
311 + G (3d,f)  level  of  theory  was  used,  and  multiple  conformers 
of  SOO  adduct  were  obtained.  They  reported  that,  while  at  low 
temperatures, the SOO ( 1 A ˊ) adduct dominantly forms SO + O , two 
additional  paths  proceeding  via  SO 
2  formation  become  impor- 
tant at high temperatures. Their calculated rate constant matched 
well with their experimental rate constant as well as with those 
from the previous experimental studies. Some modelling studies by 
Glarborg et al. [300,343] and Alzueta et al. [323] have also used the 
experimentally determined rate constants for this reaction, though 
the modelling study by Savel’ev et al. [344] required higher rate 
constant for this reaction, as shown in the ﬁgure. The lack of the 
pathways  involving  SO 
2  as  an  intermediate  in  [340]  may  be  re- 
sponsible for the huge difference in the rate constants from the 
two theoretical studies [340,342] . This reaction requires further in- 
vestigation to resolve the discrepancy related to its pathway. 

3.3.12. Theories for quantum calculations 

Sections  3.3.1 - 3.3.10  highlighted  various  theoretical  studies 
that have been conducted on sulfur reactions to determine their 
kinetics,  where  a  variety  of  theories  were  used  for  calculations. 
As a general trend, the researchers have been relatively quick in 
utilizing the most advanced and trusted theories available during 
their  time  of  study  to  be  able  to  determine  the  accurate  ther- 
modynamic and kinetic parameters. The early studies (in 1990 (cid:6) s) 
were  mostly  based  on  Moller-Plesset  perturbation  theory  (MP2, 
MP3, and MP4), which is an ab-initio wavefunction based method 
that takes into account the electron correlation effect to provide 
an improved estimate of the molecular energies as compared to 
the Hartree-Fock method (where the correlation energy is not fully 
taken  into  account).  Possibly,  with  the  development  of  powerful 
computers,  a  shift  from  MP n  to  coupled  cluster  methods  (CCSD 
and CCSD(T) that are referred to as gold-standard methods) and 
conﬁguration interaction methods (such as CISD, CISD(T), QCISD(T) 
that  allows  single,  double,  and  triple  excitations  of  electrons) 

was seen beyond year 1999 that are more accurate than MP n in 
accounting  for  electron  correlation,  but  are  also  computationally 
expensive.  For  example,  in  [241] ,  it  is  shown  that  QCISD(T)  was 
better than MP2 with similar basis sets in predicting the experi- 
mental observed bond lengths, angles, and harmonic frequencies 
of the molecules. Another study had a similar observation [197] . 
The use of density functional theory (such as B3LYP and M062X) 
and the composite methods (such as CBS-QB3, G n, and W n meth- 
ods,  where  geometries  are  optimized  at  lower  levels  of  theory, 
and energies, calculated at higher levels of theory with moderate 
size basis set is mixed with energies calculated at lower levels of 
theory with large basis sets) also picked up that provide decent 
accuracy in molecular structures and thermochemistry with rela- 
tively lower computational cost, but some DFT methods like B3LYP 
are  known  to  underestimate  the  reaction  barrier  heights  [345] . 
The  recent  calculations  on  sulfur  systems  have  utilized  CCSD(T), 
CASPT2,  MRCI,  CBS-QB3,  though  some  studies  are  also  based  on 
B3LYP, M062X, W1U, and W1BD. In the search for a computational 
method to study the thermochemical properties of sulfur-related 
species,  a  recent  study  by  Sebbar  et  al.  [339]  provides  a  good 
comparison  of  bond  energies,  enthalpies  of  formation,  reaction 
kinetic  parameters,  and  transition  state  properties,  calculated 
using several DFT (B3LYP and BB1K) and composite (CBS-QB3, G2, 
G3,  G3MP2,  G3B3  and  G3MP2B3)  methods.  While  DFT  methods 
failed  to  provide  a  good  prediction  of  thermochemistry,  among 
the composite methods, CBS-QB3 and G3MP2B3 provided the best 
results as compared to the experimental data. 

Several  reactions  related  to  sulfur  such  as  those  involving 
bond ﬁssion have multireference character due to the presence of 
near-degenerate electronic states, and the use of single reference 
methods  such  as  MP2,  G n ,  and  CCSD  may  lead  to  less  accurate 
energies  [260] .  Therefore,  the  multireference  methods  such  as 
MRCI, CASSCF, and CASPT2 have been employed in several studies 
[346,347] . In [197] , by comparing the energies of sulfurous species 
with the experimental data, it was concluded that among CASSCF, 
MRCI (single point calculations using CASSCF geometries), and G3, 
MRCI  and  G3  calculations  worked  better,  though  MRCI  energies 
should  be  more  reliable  than  G3  due  to  the  single  reference 
treatment  by  the  latter.  The  over-prediction  of  the  kinetics  for 
HS + O 
2  reaction  by  using  single  reference  method  (G2)  as  com- 
pared  to  a  multireference  method  (MRCI + Davidson)  is  already 
discussed in Section 3.3.4 . Some studies have compared the single 
reference  and  multireference  methods  [348–350] ,  and  for  the 
molecular systems studied, the general conclusion has been that 
the multireference methods work better than the single reference 
methods,  and  among  the  single  reference  methods,  the  coupled 
cluster methods like UCCSD(T) work better as compared to others. 
Intersystem crossing (ISC) occurs in S-related reactions possibly 
due to the signiﬁcant spin-orbit coupling in S that is about three 
times  larger  as  compared  to  O  atoms  [220,269] .  This  can  lead 
to  interconnected  product  channels,  which  has  been  highlighted 
in  several  studies.  For  example,  Zhou  et  al.  [269]  could  identify 
2 S + S reaction through ISC and S-insertion 
lower energy paths for H 
at  singlet  and  triplet  surfaces.  The  role  of  ISC  and  S-insertion 
was  highlighted  to  be  important  at  low  temperatures  and  high 
2 + S → H + HS in [215] . In [278] , 
2 S → H 
pressures for the reaction, H 
the  discrepancy  between  the  experimental  and  computed  rate 
constants for SH + O 
2 reaction could be resolved only after consid- 
ering ISC. In contrast to O + H 
2 , the reaction of S + H 
2 was found 
to have signiﬁcant ISC using multireference CASSCF method [220] . 
The atomic S-insertion is reported to occur with ease as a result 
of ISC [219,269] . During the recombination reaction of SH radicals 
[270] , ISC allowed the formation of triplet H 
2 from 
the singlet adduct, H 
2 S reaction, it was shown in 
[271] that the products 2SH formed on triplet surface at high tem- 
peratures, but proceeded via ISC on singlet surface at low tempera-

tures. A plenty of studies showcasing the existence of ISC in sulfur 
reactions indicate that, while selecting high-level single-reference 
and multireference methods for studying sulfur chemistry is im- 
portant, it is equally important to consider the ISC by studying the 
potential  energy  surfaces  at  multiple  spin  multiplicities  to  avoid 
the over-prediction of the energy barriers for the reactions. 

3.4. Detailed reaction mechanisms 

The  combustion  of  sulfur  species  mainly  takes  place  in  the 
Claus furnace in SRUs and in the sulfur combustor in sulfuric acid 
plants on an industrial level. The furnace in SRUs oxidizes acid gas 
2 and eliminates feed contaminants such as 
with air to produce S 
3 ,  BTEX,  and  mercaptans  [351] .  The  free 
small  hydrocarbons,  NH 
ﬂame  region  at  the  front-end  of  the  furnace  is  characterized  by 

high temperatures and very rapid reactions proceeding via radical- 
based mechanism. Only the reactions occurring in the post-ﬂame 
region following the ﬂame occur at a relatively lower temperature 
and slower rates. Additionally, some of the major reactions leading 
to the oxidation of BTEX and the production of CO, COS, and CS 
2 
are kinetically controlled and highly temperature-dependent, and 
their study requires kinetic parameters of high accuracy [161,334] . 
A reliable kinetic scheme for the furnace simulation must involve 
the reactions for the combustion of all the species present in the 
feed gas stream to reliably predict the complex chemistry involved 
in sulfur production or combustion. 

The need to understand the combustion chemistry of sulfurous 
species taking place in ﬂames and furnaces and to optimize the 
process  parameters  in  industrial  reactors  has  led  to  the  devel- 
opment  of  detailed  reaction  mechanisms  for  H/S/C/O  systems 

32 

A. Raj, S. Ibrahim and A. Jagannath / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 80 (2020) 100848 

[160,340] . The available kinetic mechanisms vary in the number of 
reactions and the rate parameters for important radical reactions. 
Some  of  these  mechanisms  were  developed  for  the  purpose  of 
evaluating  the  effect  of  sulfur  components  on  NOx  formation 
and the interactions of SO 
2  with the radical pool under different 
combustion conditions relevant to cement industry, smelters and 
power  plants.  A  review  of  the  available  kinetic  models  up  to 
2015  was  published  in  [17] .  Only  recently,  the  detailed  kinetic 
mechanisms  suitable  for  Claus  furnace  simulations  have  been 
developed  [162,166]  with  a focus  on  all the  species present  in 
the  SRU  feed.  The  recent  advances  in  the  fundamental  kinetics 
of sulfur reactions have led to the inclusion of new and revised 
radical  reaction  pathways  and  parameters  in  the  mechanism  of 
H 
2 , HSS, and HSSH 
(sulfur-sulfur  interactions)  [98,118,258,271] .  The  interactions  of 
sulfur-sulfur  species  are  extremely  important  for  H 
2 S  oxidation 
even under fuel lean conditions [131] . Other important reactions 
2  and 
include  those  of  COS  formation  from  the  reactions  of  CO 
sulfur species and the oxidation reactions of CS 
2 and mercaptans 
[306] .  As  a  result,  the  kinetic  models  have  undergone  several 
revisions.  The  most  important  reaction  pathways  in  the  kinetic 
2 S  in  the 
mechanisms  that  governs  the  oxidation  behavior  of  H 
industrial  systems  are  analyzed.  This  will  assist  in  providing  a 
detailed  guideline  to  determine  the  most  suitable  reaction  sets 
and/or  kinetic  model  to  facilitate  the  optimization  of  relevant 
industrial processes to reduce emissions and increase eﬃciency.

3.4.1. Detailed kinetic models on H 2 S pyrolysis 

The  interest  in  the  kinetics  of  H 

2 S  pyrolysis  spans  from  the 
development of accurate kinetic models for sulfur combustion to 
the formation of elemental sulfur in sulfur recovery units and the 
potential for H 

2 production from H 

2 S (reaction R1). 

H 2 S + M (cid:3) H 2 + S + M 

(R1) 

The  early  detailed  reaction  mechanism  on  H 

2 S  pyrolysis  was 
proposed  by  Bowman  and  Dodge  [125] .  They  proposed  a  6-step 
radical reaction mechanism that predicted satisfactorily their ex- 
perimentally observed proﬁles of H 
2 S and S-atom concentrations 
in a shock tube. As indicated in Section 3.3.1 , based on the early 
shock  tube  studies  [125,211] ,  the  initial  decomposition  of  H 
2 S 
was long assumed to form SH + H in the mechanisms, which was 
later challenged by Woiki and Roth [212] , who observed that the 
spin-forbidden channel producing H 
2  and S is energetically more 
favorable. Subsequent reactions following the initial decomposition 
of H 
2 S proceed through its chemical attack by S and H radicals, 
2  through  several  product 
2 ,  HSS,  and  S 
producing  mainly  SH,  H 
channels  [214] .  The  schematic  representation  of  the  important 
species and the major reaction pathways involved in H 
2 S pyrolysis 
is shown in Fig. 23 . 

The elementary reactions and their rate parameters, proposed 
in early kinetic studies (discussed in Section 3.3 .), have been used 
2 S pyrolysis. It 
to develop the detailed reaction mechanisms for H 
was observed in [216] that the mechanism of H 
2 S pyrolysis could 
not  properly  predict  the  experimental  data  over  a  wide  range 
of  conditions.  This  motivated  them  to  investigate  the  reactions, 
2 S + S and HS + HS to unravel new product channels involving HSS 
H 
and HSSH species, which were included in the detailed reaction 
mechanism that consisted of 21 elementary reactions. The mech- 
anism  was  used  to  simulate  several  experimental  data  reported 
by Adesina et al. [103] , Darwent and Roberts [101] , Kaloidas and 
Papayannakos [99] , and Karan et al. [104] . In order to successfully 
predict these experimental data, some adjustments were made to 
the rate constants of highly sensitive reactions that are responsible 
for forming and breaking of the S–S bond (reactions R2-4).

2 on H 

This mechanism served as a basis for the further development 
of the H 
2 S pyrolysis mechanisms. Binoist et al. [114] published a 
detailed reaction mechanism consisting of 22 elementary reactions 
2 S in a 
to describe their experimental data on the pyrolysis of H 
quartz tube reactor, including the autocatalytic effect of S 
2 S 
pyrolysis. The model analysis revealed the high sensitivity of HSS, 
HS, and HSSH reactions. The inclusion of these disulfur reactions in 
the detailed reaction mechanism was necessary before obtaining a 
good match between the model predictions and the experimental 
data. The high sensitivity of several reactions in the H 
2 S pyrolysis 
mechanism reinforced the need to re-evaluate and determine, with 
higher  accuracy,  the  rate  constants  of  several  disulfur  reactions 
that were based on estimates. In a theoretical study, Zhou et al. 
2 S + S 
[270] found the rate parameters for new reactions such as H 
2 S + S , 
forming HS, HSSH, H 
2 . The reactions and the rate parameters for the 
H 
2 S mech- 
new H/S reactions were incorporated in their revised H 
anism  in  [131] .  Savelieva  et  al.  [352]  adopted  some  elementary 
reactions  such  as  S 
8 ) 
and  the  radical  reactions  involving  SH,  HS 
2 ,  and  HSSH  from  the 
updated mechanism of Zhou et al. [131] in an effort to improve 
2 S oxidation mechanism. Their developed 
the accuracy of their H 
mechanism  consisted  of  27  species  and  123  reactions,  and  was 
able to predict the experimental data on H 
2 S 
pyrolysis and oxidation (under fuel rich condition) with improved 
accuracy over previous models. Note that the rate coeﬃcients and 
2 reactions 
products of the majority of sulfur–sulfur interactions (S 
to produce S 
8 ) in Zhou et al.’s mechanism were estimated 
based  on  similar  reactions,  and  not  calculated.  Fig.  24  shows  a 
comparison of Savelieva’s model predictions with the experimental 
data on H 

2  conversion  into  other  sulfur  isomer  (S

The kinetic model was able to capture qualitatively the experi- 
mentally observed trends of H 
2 S conversion at all the temperatures 
(1123–1323 K) examined. However, when compared quantitatively, 
a deviation between the experimental data and the model predic- 
tion can be seen at temperatures below 1273 K. It was noted that 
the  activation  energy  for  H 
2 S  decomposition  (reaction  R1)  was 
lowered (by ~85 kJ/mol) and the pre-exponential factor increased 
(by  an  order  of  2)  from  the  initial  values  adopted  from  [212] . 
Since no justiﬁcation was given, it is possible that the rate of such 
an  important  ignition  initiation  reaction  was  altered  to  assist  in 
decreasing  the  discrepancy  between  the  model  predictions  and 
the experimental data. This highlights the need for the addition of 
more elementary reactions to the H 
2 S mechanism possibly related 
to the chemistry of disulfur species or the reﬁnements in the rates 
of the existing important reactions. 

2  production from H 

Cong et al. [268] published an improved reaction mechanism 
for H 
2 S pyrolysis and oxidation by including 
several  reactions  involving  the  reactions  of  disulfur  interactions. 
This  mechanism,  consisting  of  89  species  and  432  reactions, 
is  based  on  the  earlier  mechanisms  published  by  Binoist  et  al. 
[114] on H 
2 S oxidation. It 
was validated against different sets of relevant experimental data 
and notable improvements on the predicted H 
2 S conversion were

2 S  conversion  at  both  low  and  high  temperatures  with 
higher accuracy as compared to the previous mechanisms. These 
notable improvements over the previously published mechanisms 
is  attributed  to  the  use  of  more  reliable  kinetic  parameters  and 
the inclusion of additional reaction channels of disulfur reactions. 
Ibrahim  et  al.  [112]  developed  a  detailed  mechanism  for  the 
2 mixtures, 
production of syngas from the pyrolysis of H 
consisting  of  elementary  reactions  for  H 
2 ,  and  COS 
combustion.  The  elementary  reactions  contained  in  the  mecha- 
2 S  pyrolysis  reactions  published 
nism  were  adopted  from  the  H 
by  Binoist  et  al.  [114]  and  Cong  et  al.  [268] ,  the  H 
2 S  oxidation 
reactions were selected from the work of Zhou et al. [131] , and 
the chemistry sets on the formation of COS and CS 
2 were adopted 
from  the  systematic  study  reported  by  Clark  et  al.  [353] .  This 
mechanism  was  validated  successfully  against  the  experimental 
data  on  syngas  production  from  acid  gas  pyrolysis  in  an  atmo- 
spheric  ﬂow  reactor  (see  Fig.  26 ).  Manenti  et  al.  [354,355]  have

The  above  studies  demonstrated  that  notable  improvements 
have been made in the understanding of H 
2 S pyrolysis mechanism. 
The  available  mechanisms  are  capable  of  predicting  the  limited 
2 S  pyrolysis  with  acceptable 
experimentally  observed  data  on  H 
accuracy. However, these mechanisms contain signiﬁcant number 
of sensitive reactions (especially disulfur reactions) that determine 
product species concentration in the H 
2 S pyrolysis process. Since 
rate  parameters  for  some  of  these  sensitive  disulfur  reactions 
were  estimated  from  similar  reactions,  further  evaluation  of  the 
model sensitivity and performance is required over a wide range 
of conditions to test their validity. Also note that the H 
2 S pyrolysis 
mechanisms  were  validated  using  experimental  data  that  seems 
to  suffer  from  surface  contamination  on  reactor  walls,  and  the 
extent of these surface effects is not yet clear. Clearly, the need 
also exists for more reliable experimental data that can assist in 
further evaluating the performance and validity of H 
2 S pyrolysis 
mechanisms  over  the  wide  range  of  conditions  encountered  in 
practical reacting systems. 

3.4.2. Detailed kinetic models on H 2 S and SO 2 oxidation 

The  earlier  detailed  reaction  mechanisms  published  by  Cerru 
and co-workers [357] and by the sulfur chemistry group at Leeds 
University  [358,359]  have  served as  the  basis  for  most  of  the 
mechanisms  developed  in  recent  years  [118] .  The  Leeds  sulfur 
mechanism  consisted  of  41  species  and  111  reactions.  In  [357] , 
Cerru  et  al.  proposed  a  reaction  mechanism  consisting  of  12 
species and 70 elementary reactions and validated it with the lim- 
2 S pyrolysis and oxidation from both 
ited experimental data on H 
laminar  and  turbulent  ﬂames.  This  mechanism  under-predicted 
both  SO 
2  and  ignition  delay  times  by  more  than  35%.  The  dis- 
crepancy  was  attributed  to  the  uncertainty  in  the  chemistry  of 
HS and disulfur radicals including HSS and HSSH that play very 
2 S oxidation, particularly under stoichiometric and 
active roles in H

found to be in good agreement with a range of experimental data

al.  [131] emphasized that the radical reactions of HS are partic- 
ularly very critical in determining product speciation in the H 
2 S 
oxidation process under stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions.

Zhou  and  co-workers  [131]  conducted  theoretical  and  exper-

pathways in the H

The oxidation of H

2 S is characterized by thermal and chemical 
decomposition  producing  mainly  H

(H, S, SH, and disulfur) at the initial stage, which is then followed 
by the oxidation reactions to produce oxygenated species. The SH

Under reducing conditions, the formation of HS and disulfur rad- 
icals are particularly more important, and so are the reactions of 
HS radicals with oxygenated species [131] . The poorly understood 
2 S 
reactions of HS with oxygenated species produced during the H 
oxidation (HS + O

using  the  advanced  ab-initio  calculations  (as  discussed  before) 
and  available  experimental  data.  The  reactions  of  HS  with  HO

The revised model was validated against experimental data on 
H 
2 S oxidation in an atmospheric pressure ﬂow reactor at temper- 
atures from 950 to 1150 K under fuel-lean conditions, as shown 
in Fig. 28 . The predictions of the base model were qualitatively in 
good agreement with the experiments. The model showed extraor- 
dinary sensitivity to the rates of a signiﬁcant number of reactions 
that determine the radical concentrations of several intermediates

including  HS,  S,  HSS,  and  HSSH  during  H

tion during H 
the radical chemistry of H

proved. H

of radicals, especially H, OH, O, and S, and thus, will be sensitive 
to the rates of the reactions that determine these concentrations.

reactions under low oxygen and low temperature conditions.

In  addition  to  reaction  R1  for  H 

2 S,  it  was  discovered  on  the 
basis  of  ab-initio  calculations  in  [258]  that  there  exists  other 
2 S + O 
reaction  initiation  channel,  H 
2 .  Though  such  a 
reaction was considered in the mechanism of Zhou et al. [131] , its 
rate constant was estimated based on similar reactions. Starik et 
al. [258] noted that Cerru et al.’s mechanism could only describe 
2 S–air mixture at high 
properly the ignition delay times in the H 
temperatures  above  1200  K.  Thus,  a  revised  mechanism  for  H 
2 S 
oxidation containing 27 species and 233 reactions was proposed 
to account for H 
2 S chain initiation reactions at lower temperatures 
below 1200 K. In addition to the principal chain initiation reaction 
2 S oxidation mechanism, they included other initia- 
( R1 ) in the H 
tion reactions of H/S radicals with singlet and triplet oxygen such 
as reaction ( R8 ) studied through quantum calculations.

The  revised  mechanism  was  carefully  validated  using  a  vast 
set of experimental data on species concentrations in H 
2 /H 
2 
ﬂames and the ignition delay data from shock tubes. A compari- 
son between the revised mechanism, experimental data, and the 
previous mechanisms by Zhou et al. and Cerru et al. is given in 
Figs.  29-31 .  Other  kinetic  models  were  not  compared  in  these 
charts  because  they  contain  reactions  and  rate  constants  in  the 
H 
2 S  sub-mechanisms  adopted  from  Zhou  et  al.  and  Cerru  et  al. 
The  revised  mechanism  showed  notable  improvements  in  the 
prediction  of  ignition  delay  times  measured  in  the  temperature 
range of 950–1400 K ( Figs. 29 and 30 ), and on the ﬂame speed 
2 S-air 
measurements  in  fuel-lean,  stoichiometric  and  fuel-rich  H 
mixtures ( Fig. 31 ). It can be observed that the revised mechanism 
by  Starik  et  al.  [258]  reproduced  the  experimental  data  on  the 
ignition  delay  of  H 
2 S  at  temperatures  below  1200  K  with  rea- 
sonable  accuracy,  whereas  the  mechanisms  of  Cerru  et  al.  and 
Zhou et al. displayed notable discrepancies with the experimental 
measurements, especially, at low temperatures, for the fuel-lean, 
near-stoichiometric and fuel-rich mixtures. This improvement was 
due to the additional reaction for the chain initiation of H 
2 S (reac- 
tion R8), in which the rate constant was found to be higher than 
the principal chain initiation reaction ( R1 ) at lower temperatures. 
The  kinetic  mechanisms  could  not  reproduce  the  experimental 
data  with  reasonable  accuracy  for  T  ≤ 10 0 0  K.  The  mechanism 
of  Zhou  et  al.  describes  the  experimental  data  for  the  fuel-rich 
mixture better as compared to the mechanism of Cerru et al. due 
to the improved chemistry of disulfur reactions that become more 
active under oxygen deﬁcient conditions. Model predictions were 
also compared with the recent experimental data on the effect of 
H 
2 /Ar mixture published 
by Mathieu et al. [96] . All the kinetic models were able to capture

included in the revised mechanism published in [98] to simulate 
2  atmospheres  (see 
H 
Fig. 32 ). The revised rate constants for selected reactions, R6-R9 
improved  the  prediction  of  the  high-pressure  experimental  data 
on H 
2 S oxidation obtained by same authors. Note that, for reaction 
R9, their predicted rate constant was an order of magnitude higher 
than the value suggested by Garrido et al. [266] and adopted by

The  high-  and  low-pressure  limits,  as  well  as  the  falloff be- 
havior,  for  reaction  R10  was  adopted  from  the  theoretical  study 
of  Zhou  et  al.  [131] .  Through  the  revised  kinetic  model,  it  was 
2 S  oxidation  proﬁles  at  different 
observed  that  the  predicted  H 
temperatures were very sensitive to the reactions of SH radicals. 
However, the high-pressure limit for reaction R10 had to be mod- 
iﬁed in order to improve agreement with the experimental data 
under  stoichiometric  conditions.  The  oxidation  rate  was  mostly 
controlled by the HS recombination reactions (R10 and R11) under 
stoichiometric conditions, while reaction R12 was more sensitive 
to HS consumption path under oxidizing condition. The rate con- 
stant and product channels for reaction R12, which are currently 
not well established, will be particularly important in the model- 
ing and optimization of oxygen enriched SRU plants. In an effort to 
optimize auto ignition in engines fueled by natural gas containing 
trace  quantities  of  H 
2 S,  Gersen  et  al.  [117]  studied  the  effect  of 
H 
2 S addition to methane ignition and oxidation at high pressures 
and  emphasized  the  importance  and  need  for  more  accurate 
determination of the rate constants for reactions R13 and R14.

Moreover, Colom-Diaz and co-workers [118] also noted that the 
kinetics of reaction R13, for which only the upper limit for the rate 
constant at room temperature [363] is available, need to be im- 
2 S oxidation mechanism. This reaction has another 
proved in the H 
product channel ( R14 ) and its high sensitivity has been reported 
by [98] , particularly at high-pressure, where HO 
2  radicals play a 
major role. It should be noted that, in Zhou et al. [131] mecha- 
nism, the reaction R13 was accounted for, and the rate constants 
were  determined  from  the  theoretical  calculations  at  high  tem- 
peratures and experimental data at room temperature [115] . The 
rate  constants  for  reactions  R13  and  R14  in  the  kinetic  model 
were revised in [118] to reproduce, with satisfactory accuracy, the 
experimental data on H 
2 S oxidation at high pressures. In a recent 
study by Colom-Diaz et al. [144] , they investigated experimentally 
the effect of pressure on the oxidation of H 
2 S, for which a revised 
kinetic model was developed based on the one reported in their 
2 S  oxidation  at  atmospheric  pressure.

of  H 
the  additional  chain  initiation  reactions  for  H 
2 S  included  in  the 
mechanism by Starik did not have negative impact on the accuracy 
of their kinetic model at high temperatures. A similar comparison 
with the experimentally observed laminar ﬂame speed data from 
H 
2 S/air ﬂames was conducted to examine the performance of the 
kinetic models (see Fig. 31 ). 

It can be seen that the mechanism of Cerru et al. [357] over- 
estimates  substantially  the  predictions  of  the  H 
2 S  laminar  ﬂame 
speeds,  while  the  revised  mechanism  of  Starik  et  al.  [258]  and 
Zhou et al.’s [131] mechanism did not show signiﬁcant discrepancy. 
This highlights the signiﬁcant improvements in the reaction mech- 
anism in recent years from the determination of the rate constants 
for several important reactions, particularly the disulfur species.

in the presence of other chemically active species found in prac- 
tical combustion furnaces. These mechanisms mainly account for 
the  reactions  of  H

PAH) and mercaptans [166,334] , and were developed to simulate 
the  production  of  sulfur  in  the  Claus  furnace.  Manenti  et  al. 
[166]  published  a  detailed  reaction  mechanism  containing  the

reactions for the oxidation of H 
mechanism  was  developed  on  the  basis  of  the  earlier  work  on 
H 
2 S  oxidation  [325,364] ,  and  hydrocarbon 
mechanisms [365] , and was validated successfully using lab-scale 
data and experimental data from an industrial SRU. Based on the 
2 S  oxidation  [131]  and  COS/CS 
improved  sub-mechanism  for  H 
2 
reactions [13] , Li et al. [209] developed a detailed kinetic model 
for Claus furnace simulation. This mechanism was validated using 
experimental data on H 
2  in a 
high temperature atmospheric ﬂow reactor, under lean, stoichio- 
metric and rich fuel conditions. They revealed that the presence 
of CO 
2 S at high temperature (above 
1200  K)  via  the  production  of  OH  and  CO  from  the  reaction  of 
2  with H radicals [366] . The CO reacts with sulfur radicals to 
CO 
2 is produced from the secondary reactions 
produce COS, while CS 
of COS. The detailed mechanisms of COS and CS 
2 oxidation will be 
discussed later. Glarborg and Marshall [274,300] conducted several 
studies on the oxidation of reduced sulfur species, and developed 
a  reaction  mechanism  for  COS  and  CS 
2  oxidation  in  which  the 
sub-mechanism on H 

2 S oxidation in the presence of CO 

2 enhances the oxidation of H 

2 S oxidation was reported. 

A detailed reaction mechanism for the co-oxidation of H 

2 S and 
hydrocarbons, including aromatics have also been developed with 
the aim of optimizing aromatics destruction to reduce natural gas 
consumption  in  the  Claus  furnace.  Mohammad  et  al.  [162]  re- 
ported a more comprehensive kinetic model for Claus furnace that 
includes the reactions of aromatics (BTEX and PAH) in addition to 
other  species  (H 
2  and  mercaptans). 
The H 
2 S sub-mechanism was based on the mechanisms reported 
in  [114,131]  including  the  reactions  on  the  formation  of  sulfur

taken  from  [356] ,  while  the  H/C  chemistry  was  taken  from  the 
recent  works  of  [367]  and  [368] .  This  mechanism  was  validated 
successfully  with  several  sets  of  lab-scale  experimental  data  ob- 
tained  from  different  reacting  systems  and  conditions.  However, 
this mechanism did not include BTEX and PAH oxidation reaction 
by SO 
2 , which makes it unsuitable for the study on the ox- 
idative destruction of aromatics in Claus furnace. In another study 
[334] , a revised kinetic mechanism was published that accounted 
for the reactions of BTEX with O

formation, growth, and oxidation (by O, OH, O 
PAHs  up  to  coronene,  which  are  known  to  be  soot  precursors, 
were also included. The reaction mechanism and rate parameters 
for the oxidation of BTEX by SO 
2  were estimated from quantum 
chemistry  calculations  [42,331–333] .  The  developed  mechanism 
was then validated using different sets of experimental data from 
ﬂames  and  reactors,  where  a  satisfactory  match  between  the 
computed  and  the  experimental  data  on  species  proﬁles  were 
obtained. The model comparison with experimental data obtained 
from a laboratory scale toluene ﬂame burning in air (reported by 
Detilleux and Vandooren [369] ) is shown in Fig. 33 . This means 
that the detailed reaction model could capture both the complex 
chemistry of sulfur compounds and that of hydrocarbons including 
aromatics.  Detilleux  and  Vandooren  [369]  measured  the  mole 
fractions of species in a laminar, premixed, and one-dimensional 
toluene-oxygen-argon ﬂame using gas chromatography and molec- 
ular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). The model showed a very 
good agreement with the experimental data, especially for the pro- 
ﬁles of aromatic species. However, a slight deviation between the 
simulated and the experimental data near the burner can be seen, 
which could be attributed to ﬂame perturbations due to probe in- 
sertion in ﬂames for gas sampling and temperature measurements.

capture the carbon-sulfur interactions was tested by simulating a 
methanol-doped H 
2 S premixed laminar ﬂame observed by Pauwels 
et al. [370] . The species mole fractions in premixed ﬂames were 
found using gas chromatography coupled with electron spin reso- 
nance spectroscopy techniques. Fig. 34 shows the comparison be- 
tween the experimental data and the simulation results, and a sat- 
isfactory agreement was observed for most of the species proﬁles. 
It  can  be  observed  that  the  model  did  not  capture  the  peak 
2 ,  which  could  be  attributed  to  the  over- 
mole  fractions  of  SO 
predicted SO radicals. The SO radicals play a signiﬁcant role in SO 
2 
2 S combustion process, and an accurate mea- 
formation during H 
surement of SO radicals can be very challenging in H 
2 S combustion 
environments, since they are highly reactive and short-lived. The 
uncertainties in the experimental data originating from experimen- 
tal limitations were not reported. This discrepancy was also noted 
with other kinetic models reported in [357,358,371] . This highlights 
the need for more accurate experimental data to evaluate the per- 
formances  of  the  various  kinetic  models  reported  in  literature. 
Nevertheless,  the  mechanism  reported  by  Rahman  and  cowork- 
ers  [334]  have  been  utilized  extensively  to  optimize  aromatics 
destruction in the gas industry and to achieve energy savings by 
reducing natural gas consumption in sulfur plants [157,167,334] . 

2 S and CH 

Some researchers have developed detailed reaction mechanisms 
suitable  for  the  optimization  of  sour  gas  combustion  under  dif- 
ferent operating conditions. In [267] , the reaction mechanism for 
the oxy-fuel combustion of H 
4  in the presence of CO 
2 
was  proposed.  The  H 
2 S  oxidation  sub-mechanism  was  adopted 
from Zhou et al. [131] , while the C/H/O sub-mechanism was from 
the  GRI  mechanism  for  CH 
4  oxidation.  It  was  observed  that  the 
kinetic model could not predict a wide range of experimental data 
with  high  accuracy,  and  an  optimization  study  was  conducted 
by varying the rate parameters of the important reactions in the 
2 S-sub  mechanism  to  achieve  a  good  agreement  between  the 
H 

2 S,  and  H 

predicted  results  and  the  relevant  experimental  data  on  laminar 
burning  velocity,  ignition  delay  time,  pyrolysis  of  H 
2 S 
oxidation  in  a  ﬂow  reactor.  The  rate  parameters  of  15  sulfur 
reactions were varied during optimization within their respective 
uncertainties.  The  optimized  mechanism  was  validated  against  a 
larger  set  of  experimental  data  over  a  wide  range  of  conditions 
for the oxidation of H 
2 S and the interactions between carbon and 
sulfur species. However, the optimized model showed quantitative 
discrepancies  between  model  predictions  and  experimental  data 
for  some  species  (such  as  SO 
2 S  conversion),  which 
2 ,  H 
highlights the uncertainties that still exist in sulfur chemistry. It 
was  noted  that  the  rates  of  several  important  reactions,  partic- 
ularly reactions 11, 15–19, changed in opposite directions during 
optimization, depending on which targets were chosen.

Similarly, Mathieu et al. [96] had to modify the rate parameters 
of  reactions  12–17  within  their  uncertainties  before  they  could 
reproduce their ignition delay time data from diluted mixtures of 
2 in a shock tube at 1.5 and 35 atm. While the modiﬁed

mechanism  predicted  the  H

it  failed  to  reproduce  the  ﬂow  reactor  data  from  Zhou  and  co- 
workers [131] . This underlines the need for more accurate direct

determination of their rate constants for reactions 12–17 and more 
accurate experimental data for validation. In another study [96] on 
the  ignition  times  and  water  time  histories  during  dilute  H 
2 S 
oxidation in shock tubes (at 1 atm and 1445–2210 K), it was found 
that the reaction mechanism by Zhou et al. [131] could not predict 
the  experimental  data  satisfactorily.  This  pointed  towards  some 
possible deﬁciencies in this mechanism and most of its derivatives. 
The adjustments in the rate of reaction, SH + HO 
2 by 
a factor of 10 and in the rates of 18 other reactions involving HS, 
HS 
2 were necessary before a good match with the 
experimental data was found. Figs. 35 and 36 show the comparison 
2 S oxidation by Mathieu et al. [96] with 
of ignition delay data on H 
the model predictions using different reaction mechanisms on H 
2 S 
oxidation in the literature. As can be seen, the ignition delay times 
were well predicted (within 10%) with the revised model by Math- 
ieu et al. [96] due to the modiﬁcations made to the rate parameters 
of 19 reactions. In comparison to other models, the model of Zhou 
et al. [131] and all the models based on their work, speciﬁcally, 
Bongartz and Ghoniem [267] , Mathieu et al. [128] , and Mohammed 
et al. [162] showed signiﬁcant discrepancies with the experimental 
data  that  vary  with  the  modiﬁcations  adopted  by  each  research

group (see Fig. 35 ). These discrepancies in the predicted ignition 
delay data were largely found to be occurring due to the signiﬁcant 
differences in the rate parameters of the reactions of HS (mainly,

The  model  of  Glarborg  and  Marshall  [300]  predicted  ignition 
delay time with a high accuracy for temperatures below 20 0 0 K, 
though the predicted ignition delay times are too long at higher 
temperatures.  It  was  noted  that  the  rates  for  several  reactions 
in the H 
2 S oxidation mechanism by Glarborg and Marshall were 
similar  to  those  used  by  Zhou  et  al.  However,  the  good  overall 
predictions  were  possible  due  to  the  rate  used  for  the  reaction, 
SH  +  O 
2  =  HSO  +  O ,  which  is  more  than  10  times  faster  than 
the rate proposed by Zhou and co-workers. The kinetic model by 
Starik et al. [210,258] (a derivative of Cerru et al. mechanism [357] ) 
was also compared with the ignition delay data from Mathieu et 
al.  [96]  ( Fig.  36 ).  It  can  be  noted  that  the  model  predicted  the 
ignition delay data with high level of accuracy due to the use of 
revised rate parameters for the ignition reactions of H/S radicals 
with singlet and triplet oxygen (such as H 
2 ). It can 
be conjectured from the above studies that the need still exists for

2 S/HS with O 

The  review  of  H 

2 S  oxidation  mechanisms  demonstrated  that 
the model performance shows very strong dependence on several 
elementary reaction channels. While some mechanisms are often 
capable of predicting the experimentally observed trends of H 
2 S 
oxidation  under  a  given  set  of  condition,  some  modiﬁcations 
to  the  rate  parameters  of  the  numerous  sensitive  reactions  are 
required in order to obtain a satisfactory match over a wide range 
of  experimental  conditions  and  reacting  systems  [96,131,267] . 
Such  sensitive  reactions  have  already  been  highlighted  above 
2 S + S , 
in  this  section.  Some  of  the  reactions  (such  as  HS + O 
and  HS + HS)  may  have  several  product  channels  that  have  not 
been  well  established.  Thus,  there  is  a  need  for  further  kinetic 
investigations on such key elementary reactions in the mechanism 
in  order  to  obtain  their  more  reliable  kinetic  parameters  and 
identify  the  dominant  reaction  products.  Three  key  reactions  in 
H 
2 S mechanism that remain poorly understood and require further 
investigations as summarized below: 

2 ,  H 

I) The  H-abstraction  reaction,  H 

2 O 

2 S  +  HO 

2  (cid:3) HS  +  H 

2  was 
2 S oxidation mechanisms 
found to be highly important in the H 
in  different  reacting  systems  and  inlet  conditions  [96,267] . 
Although  the  kinetics  of  this  reaction  has  been  investigated 
experimentally  at  low  temperature  in  both  forward  and  re- 
verse  directions,  only  the  upper  limit  rate  constant  has  been 
published till  date  [216] .  The  rate  parameters  for  the  reverse 
reaction was found by Zhou et al. [115,131] using a high level of 
theory. However, the calculations by Batiha et al. [372] , which 
were  conducted  using  different  levels  of  theory  (G3B3  and 
CBS-QB3), have indicated a much lower rate constant as com- 
pared to that of Zhou et al. [115,131] . Mathieu et al. [96] and 

Gersen  et  al.  [117]  had  to  lower  the  rate  constant  proposed 
by  Zhou  et  al.  by  a  factor  of  two  to  improve  the  agreement 
between  the  model  predictions  and  their  experimental  data 
published in [96] . This highlights the need for further kinetic 
investigations on this reaction to improve the accuracy of the 
H 

2 S mechanisms. 

II) The reaction of SH with O 

2  has been studied theoretically by 
numerous  research  groups  [260,263] .  It  has  several  proposed 
product  channels  that  include  HSO + O,  S + HO 
2 ,  SO + OH,  and 
2 + H . This reaction has a signiﬁcant barrier, and the attempts 
SO 
to  measure  the  rate  coeﬃcient  at  low  temperatures  have 
yielded only its upper limit [261] . Zhou et al. [260] indicated 
that  the  reaction  would  form  HSO + O  at  high  temperatures 
( > 10 0 0 K), but Garrido et al. [266] and Song et al. [98] sug- 
2  + H . Moreover, the rate constant 
gested the formation of SO 
2 + H formation proposed by Song et al. [98] was almost 
for SO 
an order of magnitude higher than the value of Garrido et al. 
[266] . Further studies on their reaction is required to resolve 
these discrepancies. 

III) The rate parameters for HS self-reaction, SH + SH + M (cid:3)HSSH + M 
in most of the H 
2 S mechanisms have been adopted from the 
theoretical study by Sendt et al. [216] and Zhou et al. [115,131] . 
This reaction plays an important role in the formation of S 
2 in 
H 
2 S pyrolysis and oxidation mechanisms. Most model predic- 
tions have shown very high sensitivity to the SH self-reaction, 
and the modiﬁcations to its rate parameters are often required 
in  order  to  predict  the  experimental  data  well  [96,117,268] . 
Thus,  an  improved  prediction  of  the  reaction  kinetics  would 
beneﬁt both H 

2 S pyrolysis and oxidation mechanisms. 

IV) Furthermore,  there  is  lack  of  suﬃcient  and  reliable  experi- 
mental  data  to  facilitate  model  validation  and  performance 
evaluation under practical combustion conditions. Most of the

available  experimental  data  suffer  signiﬁcantly  from  surface 
contaminations due to the occurrence of surface chemistry on 
the  reactor  walls  (a  detailed  discussion  was  given  in  Section 
3.1 ).  The  nature  of  these  surface  reactions  and  the  extent  of 
data contamination are still not very clear, and due to this, the 
accurate performance evaluation of H 
2 S oxidation mechanisms 
and  the  rate  parameters  of  numerous  sensitive  reactions  still 
remain a challenge. 

3.4.3. COS, CS 2 , and mercaptans mechanism 

The detailed kinetic models on COS, CS 

2 , and mercaptan sys- 
tems are scarce in the literature, possibly because they are present 
in low concentrations in acid gas and crude natural gas streams. 
The available kinetic models that exist in the literature are struc- 
turally similar, but differ in the elementary reactions considered 
and  the  kinetic  parameters  adopted.  An  overview  of  reaction 
2 and COS conversion is shown in Fig. 37 . 
pathways involved in CS 
Howgate  et  al.  [373]  developed  a  reaction  mechanism  for 
2  ﬂames  that  consisted  of  12  species  and  24  contributing 
2 /O 
CS 
reactions. The validity of the mechanism was determined via com- 

parison  with  experimental  data  on  CS 
2  oxidation  from  Hamman 
et al. [150] . Murakami et al. [149] developed a detailed reaction 
mechanism  for  CS 
2  (dry)  oxidation  containing  14  elementary 
reactions, in which the rate constants for ﬁve important reactions 
in the model were determined through shock-tube experimental 
studies. Glarborg et al. [300] developed a detailed chemical kinetic 
model for the dry oxidation of COS with a particular focus on fuel 
lean combustion condition (in which the COS hydrolysis reactions 
were  irrelevant).  This  kinetic  model  was  validated  using  experi- 
mental data from batch reactors, ﬂow reactors, and shock tubes for 
the oxidation of COS over a wide range of stoichiometric air–fuel 
ratios,  temperature  range  of  450–1700  K,  and  pressure  range  of 
0.02–3.0  atm.  COS  oxidation  was  found  to  be  very  sensitive  to 
the branching fraction for the COS + O reaction to form CO + SO 
( R20 ) or CO 

2 + S ( R21 ).

these  highly  sensitive  reactions,  missing  in  the  current  mech- 
2  oxidation  may  explain  the  discrepancy  between 
anism  of  CS 
the  predictions.  Abian  et  al.  [13]  studied  COS  and  CS 
2  oxidation 
experimentally  under  fuel  rich  and  lean  conditions  and  in  the 
presence of water vapor. They revised the CS 
2 reaction subset 
based on the earlier mechanism reported in [274] by introducing 
lower  activation  energies  for  the  chain  initiation  (CS 
2 ) 
and  chain  branching  (CS  +  O )  steps  and  the  reactions  for  COS 
hydrolysis to achieve improved agreement with their experimental 
measurements.  Rahman  et  al.  [306]  observed  that  the  previous 
2 sub-mechanism leads to an under-prediction of COS 
COS and CS 
emission  from  Claus  furnace  when  compared  to  the  industrial 
data.  They  conducted  ab-initio  studies  on  the  highly  sensitive 
reaction  of  COS  with  O  and  found  that  the  reaction  does  not 
proceeds  in  a  single-step.  They  also  found  the  need  to  include 
additional  reaction  pathways  for  COS  (R22  and  R23)  that  play 
active roles in the high-temperature environment of Claus furnace, 
but were not deemed signiﬁcant in the previous mechanisms.

The revised mechanism was validated successfully and notable 
improvements over the previously reported models were observed 
when compared to different sets of experimental data. To provide 
further  improvements  on  the  mechanisms  of  CS 
2  and  COS  oxi- 
dation,  Zeng  et  al.  [151]  conducted  experimental  and  theoretical 
investigations  on  the  kinetics  of  CS 
2  oxidation  in  a  jet-stirred 
reactor (JSR). They observed relatively slow conversion of COS to 
ﬁnal products (mainly CO and SO 
2 ) in the JSR when compared to 
data  from  tubular  ﬂow  reactor,  providing  favorable  condition  to 
gain  insight  into  the  conversion  of  COS  (a  major  reaction  inter- 
2  oxidation). In order to obtain a good match with 
mediate in CS 
their experimental data, they used a higher reaction rate for the

Zheng and co-workers [153] examined the oxidation of reduced 
sulfur  species  and  published  a  detailed  reaction  mechanism  for 
the  pyrolysis  and  oxidation  of  diethyl  sulﬁde  consisting  of  70 
species and 170 reactions. The mechanism predictions reproduced 
the  experimental  results  on  the  major  species  (SO 
2 ,  CO,  and 
6 )  observed  during  the  oxidation  of  diethyl  sulﬁde  under 
C 
all  the  studied  conditions.  However,  the  mechanism  predictions 
showed signiﬁcant discrepancies with experimental data on minor 
species detected at low concentrations below 10 ppm, though the 
qualitative  trends  were  reproduced.  The  species  concentrations 
were found to be to be sensitive to radical branching, propagation, 
and termination reactions involving H, O, and OH. The kinetics of 
major  reaction  intermediates  including  CH 
3 CHS  were 
deemed  to  be  very  important,  and  a  more  direct  measurements 
of these species would be highly desirable to provide an accurate 
data set for mechanism improvement. By analogy to the reactions 
of diethyl sulﬁde oxidation, Zheng et al. [154] developed a detailed 
reaction mechanism for ethyl methyl sulﬁde pyrolysis and oxida- 
tion. They noted that further investigations are needed to improve 
the  kinetics  of  some  reactions,  in  particular,  the  initiation  and 
abstraction steps associated with the destruction of ethyl methyl 
sulﬁde and the fate of thioaldehyde intermediates.

In  a  recent  study  by  Alzueta  et  al.  [152] ,  a  detailed  reaction 
mechanism for the oxidation of methyl sulﬁde was published. The 
mechanism was developed from the reaction subsets reported in 
previous  studies  [153,323] .  This  mechanism  was  used  to  predict 
their experimental results on the oxidation of methyl mercaptan in 
a quartz tube reactor under different combustion conditions. While 
a satisfactory agreement between the experimental results and the 
simulations were observed for most of the species, the mechanism 
failed to predict the early CO formation observed experimentally 
for all the conditions studied and from experiments carried out in 
different experimental installations.

Due to the existence of relatively powerful computational sys- 
tems these days, the use of reduced reaction mechanism of vary- 
ing  complexities  for  the  analysis  of  industrial  H 
2 S  combustion 
processes  instead  of  global  reactions  have  been  explored  [164] . 
2 S  mechanism 
Some  studies  attempting  to  reduce  the  detailed  H 
are highlighted below. Cerru et al. [374] presented a reduced H 
2 S 
pyrolysis and oxidation mechanism containing 6-step reactions us- 
ing sensitivity analysis approach and steady state assumption for 
2 , and S. Selim 
minor species that included HSO, HOSO, HOSO 
and co-workers [375] implemented an error propagation approach 
to reduce the detailed reaction mechanism proposed by Leeds Uni- 
versity [358] down to 19 reactions with maximum error of 16%. A 
detailed review of the available reduced mechanisms for H 
2 S oxi- 
dation was given in [17] . More recently, Savelieva et al. [352] stud- 
ied the reaction pathways and sensitivity analysis of H 
2 S pyrolysis 
and  fuel-rich  oxidation,  and  proposed  a  reduced  reaction  mech- 
anism  containing  27  species  and  123  reactions.  Also,  Ibrahim  et 
al. [112] conducted a sensitivity analysis on the reactions of H 
2 S 
2 pyrolysis and oxidation, and proposed a reduced reaction 
and CO 
mechanism that contained 87 species and 432 reactions through 
sensitivity analysis. Mahmoodi et al. [164] took the reduced mech- 
anism  from  Ibrahim et  al.  [112]  and coupled  it  with  a  commer- 
cial CFD tool to study the effect of gas ﬂow behavior, heat transfer, 
and chemical species transport in the thermal reactor furnace of 
an industrial SRU. The kinetic model accounted for the reactions of 
H 
4 , while those of higher hydrocarbons and mer- 
captans were neglected. The CFD model predicted reasonable re- 
2 S conversion eﬃciencies and gas temperature pro- 
sults for the H 
ﬁle along the reactor furnace when compared with the experimen-

tal  data,  which  indicated  the  reliability  of  such  reaction  mecha- 
nism.  Since  mechanism  reduction  is  usually  carried  over  a  nar- 
row range of temperature, pressure, and/or equivalence ratio, care 
should be taken before using reduced mechanisms for sensitivity 
analysis or process optimization, where process parameters may go 
beyond the range of applicability of the reduced mechanism. 

4. Process optimization 

Before  initiating  the  process  optimization  of  SRU  process,  a 
detailed sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the crucial 
independent  parameters  and  its  effect  on  the  overall  dependent 
parameters.  Independent  parameters  (temperature,  pressure  etc.) 
usually  refer  to  one  or  more  design  or  operational  aspects  of  a 
process that can be modiﬁed or tweaked. The dependent param- 
eters  (such  as  reactor  conversion,  eﬃciency,  and  cost),  on  the 
other  hand,  tend  to  represent  a  desirable  quantitative  aspect  of 
a process. A dependent parameter represents a complex lumped 
function  of  several  independent  parameters;  hence,  it  can  only 
be  measured  and  not  be  controlled  or  modiﬁed  directly.  With 
respect to process optimization, independent parameters represent 
decision variables and dependent parameters (a single dependent 
parameter or a combination of dependent parameters) represent 
objective  function  variables.  Thus,  in  optimization,  the  objec- 
tive  function  is  either  maximized  or  minimized  by  varying  the 
independent variables. 

Sensitivity  analysis  is  normally  done  using  one  parameter 
at  a  time  (i.e.,  one  independent  parameter  vs.  one  dependent 
parameter).  The  main  aim  of  sensitivity  analysis  is  to  identify 
the suitable ranges of the independent parameters in which the 
dependent  parameter  values  are  in  acceptable  limits.  Several 
sensitivity analyses have been conducted for the Claus furnace and 
the WHB in the literature. The dependent parameters considered 
for such studies are the concentrations of important species (such 
as COS, sulfur, and aromatics) at the reactor outlet, sulfur recovery 
eﬃciency,  furnace  temperature,  steam  production,  and  H 
2 S/SO 
2 
ratio in the eﬄuent gas. Both global reaction models and detailed 
reaction  mechanisms  have  been  used  for  such  analysis,  and  the 
qualitative  aspects  of  those  studies  using  different  independent 
parameters are analyzed below.

Before proceeding with the sensitivity studies, it is important 
to clarify how the sulfur recovery eﬃciencies in different studies 
have been estimated. As known, sulfur exists as eight allotropes 
(S 
8 ),  whose  concentrations  are  temperature  dependent.  At 
temperatures  higher  than  327  °C,  sulfur  exists  predominantly  as 
8 are dominant.

S 
Based  upon  the  extent  of  mathematical  model  considered,  the 
deﬁnition of sulfur recovery eﬃciency has differed among differ- 
ent literature works.  For the studies that considered a full scale 
SRU plant (Claus furnace, WHB, Catalytic Converters, Condensers, 
2 , 
etc.)  [159,160,163,167,376] ,  all  the  sulfur  allotropes  (majorly  S 
S 
8 )  were  included  in  their  reaction  mechanisms  (or 
6 ,  and/or  S 
in  empirical  correlations)  and  the  sulfur  recovery  was  calcu- 
lated from the concentrations of these allotropes. In the studies, 
which  involved  only  Claus  furnace  and  WHB  (thermal  section), 
some  have  used  all  sulfur  allotropes  to  calculate  sulfur  recov- 
ery  [157,160,167,334] ,  while  others,  in  an  effort  to  simplify  the 
mathematical  model,  have  considered  only  S 
2  in  their  reaction 
mechanism  and  based  their  sulfur  recovery  calculation  on  the 
same  [155,177,198] .  Ghahraloud  and  co-workers  [163,376]  calcu- 
2  and 
lated  sulfur  recovery  as  sulfur  at  the  WHB  outlet  using  S 
S 
6  concentrations  divided  by  the  concentration  of  sulfur  in  acid 
gas feed. The above-mentioned aspects of sulfur recovery are also 
highlighted in Table 12, which lists different studies that carried 
out process optimization of SRU. It should be noted that, except 
the works of Rahman and co-workers [157,167,334] , other studies 

46 

A. Raj, S. Ibrahim and A. Jagannath / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 80 (2020) 100848 

have not explicitly stated whether a constant ratio of H 
2 was 
maintained at the exit of the thermal section in their sensitivity 
studies. This could be a probable reason for the difference in some 
of the trends observed.

Fuel gas (natural gas) ﬂow rate : When acid gas feeds become 
lean, ﬂame extinction may occur in the Claus furnace. Moreover, 
lean feeds lead to low furnace temperatures that cause ineﬃcient 
destruction of acid gas feed contaminants such as BTEX. Therefore, 
fuel gas is added to ensure that there is suﬃciently high tempera- 
ture in the Claus furnace and the ﬂame is stable. A decrease in the 
sulfur recovery eﬃciency and H 
2 ratio and an increase in the 
2 S/SO 
steam  production  was  reported  by  Kazempour  et  al.  [159]  with 
increasing fuel gas ﬂow rate to the furnace, though no explanation 
was  given  for  the  trends.  Methane  in  the  fuel  gas  can  combine 
with the other hydrocarbons in the acid gas in the anoxic region of 
the furnace to form PAH (soot precursors). Shabin et al. [162] sim- 
ulated the variations in fuel gas ﬂow to an industrial Claus furnace 
using a detailed kinetic mechanism developed in [371] . They ﬁxed 
2  to  2:1  at  the WHB  outlet  by  adjusting  the 
the  ratio  of  H 
air ﬂowrate. Although CS 
2  decomposed (at end of Claus furnace) 
for all the fuel gas ﬂow rates, the decomposition was slow for the 
cases with the low fuel gas ﬂowrates, as the furnace temperatures 
were  low.  COS  and  BTEX  concentrations  at  the  exit  of  Claus 
furnace  reduced  with  increasing  fuel  gas  ﬂowrate  due  to  their 
decomposition  at  high  furnace  temperatures.  At  the  WHB  exit, 
there was a trend reversal with higher fuel gas ﬂows exhibiting a 
slight increase in COS and BTEX concentrations possibly because of 
some recombination reactions leading to their formation. Through 
their simulations, Shabin et al. [162] also showed the existence of 
PAH compounds (from naphthalene to coronene) at the end of the 
thermal section of the furnace with some compounds (especially, 
coronene) exhibiting an increase in concentration with increasing 
fuel gas ﬂowrate. These compounds are soot precursors and can 
result in catalyst poisoning in the downstream catalytic reactors. 
Ibrahim et al. [366] used the detailed mechanism of [334] to show 
the combined effect of fuel gas variation with H 
2 S content in the 
acid gas. Their results showed that increasing the fuel gas ﬂowrate 
for rich acid gas feeds (~50% H2S content) resulted in the decrease 
in  the  concentrations  of  aromatics  (BTEX  +  PAH)  at  the  end  of 
thermal sections. In sharp contrast, for relatively leaner acid gas 
2 S), an increase in the levels of aro- 
feeds (~40%, ~35%, and ~30%H 
matics is observed with an increase in fuel gas ﬂowrate. This was 
because rich acid gas feeds reach higher adiabatic ﬂame temper- 
ature than the lean feeds. At low temperatures, methane, instead 
of  getting  completely  oxidized,  undergo  pyrolysis  reactions,  and 
can combine with other hydrocarbons in the furnace to form large 
aromatic compounds (PAHs). A threshold temperature of 1300 K 
was suggested by authors below which addition of fuel gas may 
not help in the reduction of aromatics. Both the above-mentioned 
studies suggested using an optimum fuel gas ﬂows based on the 
concentrations of aromatics in feed. Rahman et al. [157] , using the 
detailed reaction mechanism from [334] , simulated various scenar- 
ios to ﬁnd ways to reduce the usage of fuel gas in the Claus ther- 
mal section. H 
2 ratio in all cases was ﬁxed to 2 by increasing 
the air ﬂowrate. Air was also preheated in all the cases to ensure 
the same conditions as the base case. The only variation was in the 
amount of fuel gas used in all the cases. The results showed that 
sulfur recovery improved and COS and CS 
2 formation reduced with 
reduced usage of fuel gas. In their scenario of no usage of fuel gas, 
although  the  sulfur  recovery  improved,  aromatics  concentration 
increased at the end of the thermal section because of the reduced 
temperature in the furnace despite the increase in air preheating. 
This  proved  that  it  is  essential  to  co-ﬁre  acid  gas  feeds  with 
some amount of fuel gas to maintain a minimum threshold Claus 
furnace  temperature  (1323  K).  They  also  found  the  optimal  fuel 
gas ﬂow rates to the furnace and to the air preheater to achieve 

2 S/SO 

economic gains. Rahman et al. [167] , using a detailed mechanism, 
showed increases in Claus furnace temperature and steam produc- 
tion and a decrease in aromatics (BTEX) emission with increase in 
fuel gas ﬂowrate. The sulfur recovery eﬃciency at the WHB and 
catalytic units slightly decreased with increasing fuel gas ﬂowrate 
due to the formation of COS and CS 
2 in the furnace. COS formation 
increases, while CS 
2 formation increases and then decreases with 
higher fuel gas ﬂows. The reason for such a trend is the favoring 
of CO formation at high temperatures in the furnace. CO combines 
2  formation 
with  sulfur  to  form  COS,  and  hence  the  trend.  CS 
depends  not  only  on  CO,  but  also  on  uncombusted  CH 
4 .  At  low 
fuel gas ﬂows, because of high temperature in the furnace, CO for- 
4  ultimately 
mation and the presence of some undecomposed CH 
4 is 
favors CS 
reduced faster due to high temperatures, and, thus, CS 
2 formation 
decreases.  Note  that  the  higher  amounts  of  CO  could  ultimately 
lead to higher requirement of fuel gas in the incinerator section 
of the Claus plant to combust it. Thus, the authors also state that 
an  optimal  amount  of  fuel  gas  is  required  to  ensure  suﬃciently 
high temperature in the furnace to increase sulfur recovery eﬃ- 
ciency and aromatics destruction and minimize CO, COS, and CS 
2 
emissions.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  concentrations  of  COS  and  CS

H 
the  COS  and  CS

respectively,  and  at  the  exit  of  the  WHB  (temperature  about 
427 °C), the mass fractions of COS and CS2 were 0.0045 and 0.001, 
respectively.

Effect  of  Residence  time :  In  [334] ,  the  residence  time  of  acid 
gas  feed  in  the  thermal  section  of  SRU  was  varied  to  see  its 
effects on the furnace temperature and concentrations of aromat- 
ics  (BTEX  +  PAH)  and  other  constituents  of  the  acid  gas  at  the 
end  of  the  thermal  section.  The  residence  times  were  varied  by 
controlling  the  feed  ﬂow  rate.  The  results  show  that  the  Claus 
furnace temperature was nearly independent of the gas velocity. 
An increase in the residence time led to a reduction in the concen- 
tration of aromatics at the end of the thermal section (a decrease 
of 52% in velocity led to almost 76% reduction in aromatics). While 
this could be an interesting solution to reducing aromatics in the 
thermal section, the authors reported that such decreases in the 
gas velocities are not favorable in practical industrial practices, as 
it could increase production costs. The global reaction mechanism 
studies  have  not  considered  the  residence  time  aspect  in  their 
simulations. 

Effect  of  Claus  feed  temperature :  The  effects  of  varying  fur- 
nace  feed  temperature  have  been  studied  using  both  global 
[155,377]  and  detailed  reaction  mechanisms  [334] .  The  increase 
in the feed temperature increases the Claus furnace temperature. 
The  detailed  reaction  mechanism  of  Rahman  et  al.  [334]  also 
showed higher concentration of sulfur at the exit of furnace with 
increase in feed temperature. However, Kardan and Eslamloueyan 
[198]  showed  that  the  trend  was  mostly  constant  (with  very 
negligible  decrease)  in  sulfur  recovery  eﬃciency  with  increased 
feed temperature. COS concentration at the exit of Claus furnace 
slightly  decreased  with  increase  in  feed  temperature  [155] ,  as 
the high temperatures in the furnace enabled the combustion of 
hydrocarbon  impurities  that  would  have  otherwise  formed  COS.

The detailed reaction mechanism of Rahman et al. [334] showed 
no effect in COS concentrations at the exit of furnace with change 
in temperatures. A negligibly increase in COS concentration with 
increase in temperature was noticed by Kardan and Eslamloueyan 
[198] and Zarei [377] . Given the miniscule quantity of COS at the 
exit  of  furnace,  a  regular  trend  could  be  diﬃcult  to  ascertain. 
H 
2  ratio  showed  a  decreasing  trend  with  increase  in  feed 
temperature at the exit of the Claus furnace given the increased 
decomposition of H 
2 S [155,198] . Higher furnace temperatures and 
steam  production  with  increase  in  Claus  furnace  feed  (both  air 
and acid gas) temperatures were shown in [167] . The COS and CS 
2 
also showed the same trend as that with the fuel gas ﬂowrates for 
increase in Claus feed temperature. The reason for the same could 
be attributed to higher furnace temperatures. 

At  the  end  of  the  WHB,  Kardan  and  Eslamloueyan  [198]  and 
Zarei et al. [155] showed fairly constant (with slight decrease) in 
the sulfur recovery value with increasing feed temperature. Sulfur 
recovery at the end of WHB was less than that at the end of Claus 
furnace because of H 
2 S recombination reactions in the WHB that 
consumed some sulfur. Kazempour et al. [159] showed an overall 
increase  in  the  sulfur  recovery  at  the  WHB  exit.  Rahman  et  al. 
8  concentration  increased  at  the  WHB  exit, 
[334]  showed  that  S 
while S 
2 reduced. The temperature of the Claus feed showed very 
little  or  no  effect  with  respect  to  the  sulfur  recovery  eﬃciency 
at  the  exits  of  the  WHB  and  the  catalytic  converters  [167] .  The 
reason, as stated by authors, was that the equilibrium reactions of 
sulfur formation in furnace remained stable for moderate changes 
in  furnace  temperatures  (the  corresponding  increase  in  furnace 
temperature  was  only  30  °C  when  air  temperature  was  varied 
between 150 °C and 325 °C). A decreasing trend in H 
2 ratio 
was also seen at the exit of WHB in [159,198] with increasing feed 
2 S in the WHB. Be- 
temperature, indicating some formation of H 
cause of the increase in furnace temperature, the steam production 
showed an increasing trend [159] . Unlike [334] , the H 
2 ratios 
were not ﬁxed for the above reported studies. COS concentrations 
showed  an  increase  in  the  WHB  because  of  the  recombination 
reactions. This was exhibited by both global [155,198] and detailed 
reaction  mechanisms  [334] .  The  aromatic  content  at  the  exit  of 
WHB showed a gradual decrease as the ﬂame temperature in the 
Claus  furnace  increased  [167] .  Rahman  et  al.  [334]  suggested  to 
increase  the  temperature  of  the  air  stream  instead  of  acid  gas 
stream  to  raise  the  furnace  temperature,  as  preheating  acid  gas 
may cause some H 
2 S pyrolysis before the feed reaches the Claus 
furnace. However, if preheating temperature is below 850 K, acid 
gas stream can be preheated, as pyrolysis is less important below 
this temperature.

Effect of oxygen enrichment : Rahman et al. [334] studied oxygen 
enrichment  of  the  air  stream  by:  (a)  maintaining  H 
2  ratio 
at  the  exit  of  WHB  to  2  and  increasing  the  concentration  of 
oxygen  in  the  air  stream,  while  simultaneously  reducing  the  air 
ﬂow  rate,  and  (b)  ﬁxing  the  overall  feed  ﬂow  rate  to  the  Claus 
furnace constant by adjusting the acid gas and air ﬂow rates and 
increasing the oxygen content of the air stream. In (a), the ﬂame 
temperature  of  the  furnace  increased  with  oxygen  enrichment 
as the total feed ﬂow rate reduced. However, the residence time 
increased  in  the  furnace  and  the  WHB,  providing  a  signiﬁcant 
temperature drop at exit of WHB. Because of ﬁxing H 
2 ratio, 
the H 
8  remained unaffected for all enrichment 
levels. COS level increased for different enrichment levels at the 
exit of WHB. As suggested by authors, the high temperatures in 
2  to  dissociate  to  CO  resulting  in  high 
Claus  furnace  caused  CO 
COS  levels  (more  than  the  normal  base  case  with  19%  O 
2 ).  The 
CO level was seen to increase in the Claus furnace, but it slightly 
decreased  at  the  WHB  exit  because  of  in  consumption  in  COS 
formation  reactions.  The  concentration  of  aromatics  decreased 
with increase in enrichment levels, possibly because of the high

temperature in the Claus furnace. In (b) as well, ﬂame temperature 
increased  with  oxygen  enrichment,  but  to  a  lesser  extent  than 
2  showed an increase in their concentrations 
(a). H 
with increasing enrichment levels because of increasing ﬂow rates 
of acid gas in the feed. CO and COS showed similar trends as in 
(a). An interesting observation was that, despite lower residence 
times  and  higher  acid  gas  ﬂows,  there  was  higher  destruction 
of aromatics. This shows that oxygen enrichment has a stronger 
and  more  pronounced  effect  on  aromatic  destruction  than  the 
residence time. The authors also mentioned that, in practice, up 
to 28% oxygen enrichment is possible without modiﬁcation of the 
conventional SRU process and by injecting pure oxygen into the 
air stream. For higher levels, especially > 50%, direct injection of 
oxygen into the furnace should be carried out with special met- 
allurgical  and  refractory  materials  (for  furnace  and  WHB  tubes) 
followed by eﬃcient safety and control systems in place. 

Zarei et al. [177] studied the effects of oxygen enrichment with 
the  global  mechanism.  The  oxygen  content  in  the  feed  stream 
was  increased,  however,  no  information  was  provided  regarding 
the  changes  to  the  air  or  acid  gas  ﬂow  rates.  As  seen  with  the 
detailed mechanism, COS concentration increased with increasing 
2 ratio showed a 
enrichment level at the exit of WHB. The H 
decreasing trend and approached a very small value both at the 
exits of Claus furnace and the WHB. The reason was the increasing 
concentration of SO 
2 S in the 
Claus  furnace  with  increasing  oxygen  enrichment.  However,  the 
2 was higher at the WHB exit as compared to Claus 
ratio of H 
furnace exit because of the possible recombination reactions in the 
WHB. Conversely, sulfur conversion eﬃciency showed a decreasing 
trend possibly because of higher SO 

2 and diminishing concentration of H 

2 in the system.

Effect of air ﬂow rate in Claus furnace : The air ﬂow rate to the 
Claus furnace is higher than the acid gas ﬂow rate to ensure the 
desired  combustion  level  of  H 
2 S  and  other  impurities  in  feed. 
Increasing air ﬂow rate or the ratio of air to acid gas ﬂow rate in- 
creases furnace temperature [155,177] and the steam production in 
the WHB [159,160] . The sulfur conversion eﬃciency ﬁrst increased, 
reached a maximum value and then decreased with increasing air 
ﬂow rate [155,159,177] . As air ﬂow rate was increased, it enhanced 
H 
2 S decomposition and oxidation to produce sulfur, but with fur- 
ther increase it, as more oxygen was available in the furnace, the 
2 S reduced, which reduced the sulfur 
concentration of unburnt H 
2 S is also required in the Claus reaction to 
formation rate (since H 
produce sulfur). A decreasing trend was observed in the H 
2 S/SO 
2 
ratio  at  the  WHB  outlet  with  increasing  air  ﬂowrate  [159] .  The 
amount of air is usually estimated from equilibrium calculations 
2  ratio  at  the  end  of  WHB  is  around  two. 
such  that  the  H 
Increasing  the  air  ﬂow  decreases  this  ratio  (as  the  formation  of 
SO 
2 increases) as well as the COS concentration at the end of the 
furnace and the WHB [155,377] .

Effect of pressure : Manenti et al. [160] , using their detailed reac- 
tion mechanism, varied the Claus furnace pressure and concluded 
that  while  there  was  no  effect  on  sulfur  production,  the  steam 
production increased with increasing furnace pressure. Kazempour 
et al. [159] (using a global reaction model) also observed a similar 
trend  for  steam  production,  but  found  a  slightly  increasing  and 
then decreasing trend for the sulfur recovery eﬃciency. They also 
showed an undesirable decrease in the H 
2  ratio at the end 
of  thermal  section  with  increasing  Claus  furnace  pressure.  The 
reason  for  no  change  in  the  sulfur  production  in  the  results  of 
Manenti  et  al.  [160]  could  be  possibly  attributed  to  the  ﬁxed 
2  ratio  at  the  end  of  the  thermal  section  used 
value  of  H 
in their simulations. Though steam production can be increased, 
Kazempour et al. [159] pointed out that increasing pressure is a 
highly  energy  consuming  process,  which  could  have  signiﬁcant 
operational and capital expenditures.

Effect  of  steam  pressure/WHB  boiling  water  temperature :  Zarei 
et  al.  [155]  (using  a  global  reaction  model)  showed  that  with 
2 S/SO 
increasing  steam  pressure,  COS  concentration  and  the  H 
2 
ratio increase, whereas sulfur conversion eﬃciency decreases. The 
reason  given  by  the  authors  was  that  high  steam  pressure  will 
result in slow heat transfer between the process gas (in tubes) and 
water (in shell). Thus, to compensate for the loss of heat transfer, 
the process gas would spend more time in the tubes of the WHB, 
thereby  promoting  recombination  reactions  and  consequently, 
increasing COS and H 
2 S ﬂow rates and decreasing sulfur recovery. 
Manenti  et  al.  [160] ,  using  their  detailed  mechanism,  saw  no 
considerable  change  in  the  sulfur  content  with  changing  WHB 
boiling water temperatures. However, they reported an increase in 
steam production with increasing WHB boiling water temperature. 
While several independent parameters have been studied previ- 
ously, it is of importance to see how these independent parameters 
affect each other as well as the dependent parameters, when con- 
sidered simultaneously. For this purpose, process optimization is 
carried  out  to  ﬁnd  the  best  feasible  combination  of  dependent 
variables  when  all  the  independent  variables  are  simultaneously 
explored  within  their  respective  ranges.  Sometimes,  apart  from 
the ranges of the independent variables, one or more constraints 
or limitations can exist, which may limit the overall solution space 
and make the process of optimization complicated and non-trivial. 
Table 9 provides the list of studies that have dealt with process 
optimization along with the details of optimization methodology, 
objective  functions,  decision  variables,  and  the  results  of  opti- 
mization studies. It can be seen in the table that, while Manenti 
et al. [160] and Rahman et al. [167] have used detailed reaction 
mechanisms  for  process  optimization,  others  have  considered 
global reaction sets for it. This, in fact, happens to be one of the 
biggest  disadvantages,  as  global  reaction  parameters  are  found 
through  ﬁtting  exercise  using  experimental  data  (obtained  over 
a  very  limited  range  of  process  conditions),  and  thus,  those  pa- 
rameters may not be suitable for use beyond those ranges often 
encountered during optimization. The detailed reaction mechanism 
comprehensively describes every reaction by considering its inter- 
mediate and radical chemical species. These, when combined with 
the conservation equations (mass and energy balance equations), 
make the model size extremely large. This is further complicated 
by the high degree of nonlinearity in the kinetic rate expressions 
for chemical reactions. The large size coupled with nonlinearity in 
the model can make optimization of the process extremely diﬃ- 
cult; in such cases, it either takes a lot of computational time to 
solve the problem, or, in extreme cases, could lead to instances of 
convergence issues eventually resulting in diﬃculty in obtaining a 
solution. 

From the table, we also observe that stochastic optimization ap- 
proach has been mostly preferred over the deterministic optimiza- 
tion approach. This is understandable, given the size of the opti- 
mization model and its associated nonlinearity in the kinetic rate 
expressions (even in the case of global reaction set). Deterministic 
optimization  approaches  rely  on  the  principles  of  mathematics, 
and involve ﬁnding stationary points and evaluating their eﬃcacies 
by  computing  second  derivatives  and  hessian  matrix  according 
to  the  conditions  of  optimality  [378] .  Stochastic  optimization 
approaches (or derivative free optimization) rely on objective func- 
tion evaluation over the entire feasible region and comparing their 
values to obtain best solutions in a particular iteration [379] . Two 
distinct  advantages  exist  for  the  stochastic  optimization  over  its 
deterministic counterpart. First, stochastic optimization can yield 
global or close to global solutions (based on the tuning parameters 
in the algorithm) for convex and non-convex functions. Conversely, 
deterministic  approaches  tend  to  get  trapped  in  locally  optimal 
solutions for non-convex functions [378] . Second, the deterministic 
approaches rely heavily on the initial starting points in comparison 

to the stochastic approaches [378] . Because of the evaluations of 
derivatives, starting points and search directions are crucial for de- 
terministic optimization approaches. Bad initial points could lead 
to  farther  off search  directions  that  could  possibly  lead  to  long 
computational times to reach best optimal solution or tendency to 
reach a locally optimal solution (in case of non-convex functions). 
The above-mentioned critical aspects can be more-or-less averted 
by using stochastic optimization approaches, thereby making it an 
attractive option for solving optimization models for SRU process. 
Although  computational  time  to  solve  an  optimization  model 
is an important aspect, there is no mention of the same by the 
studies  reported  in  Table  9 .  Despite  sulfur  recovery  being  an 
important  component  of  SRU  process,  all  the  studies  reported 
in  Table  9  adopt  multiple  objectives  such  as  steam  production, 
COS emissions, and Claus furnace temperature. Even in the single 
objective  studies  of  Manenti  et  al.  [160]  and  Ghahraloud  et  al. 
[163,376] , different objective function components were embedded 
as  single  objective  function  to  make  the  optimal  solution  more 
versatile. The optimal operating conditions are highly dependent 
on the feed conditions, and such studies are repeated as the feed 
conditions change.

5.1. Hydrogen and syngas production from H 2 S-rich acid gas 

Hydrogen  is  an  important  industrial  compound.  It  is  used 
as  a  reactant  in  hydrotreating  and  hydrocracking  operations  in 
petroleum  reﬁneries  to  upgrade  low  grade  fuels,  as  an  energy 
carrier in electrolysis [380] , and as a possible feedstock for energy 
generation plants employing solid oxide fuel cells [381] . Presently, 
most  of  hydrogen  is  produced  from  conventional  sources  such 
as natural gas (by steam reforming), residual oil in reﬁneries (by 
partial  oxidation),  coal  and  biomass  (by  gasiﬁcation)  and  from 
water (by electrolysis). Thermodynamically, it seems favorable to 
produce H 
2 S is 
20.4 kJ/mol, which is less than the enthalpy of decomposition for 
water (286 kJ/mol) and methane (75 kJ/mol) [382,383] . However, 
its dissociation is highly endothermic and is favored at high tem- 
peratures.  According  to  thermodynamic  equilibrium  calculations, 
2 S conversion occurs at 1273 K and > 50% conversion occurs 
20% H 
above  1648  K  [384,385] .  With  the  development  of  new  sour  oil 
and  gas  reservoirs,  an  increase  in  the  production  of  acid  gas  is 
expected,  which  implies  an  impending  need  to  develop  cost- 
effective ways of recovering products such as hydrogen from H 
2 S, 
as recovering only sulfur from it is not very proﬁtable [217,386]

2 from H 

Several researchers have studied the retroﬁtting or modiﬁcation 
of existing SRU plant setups to utilize the existing infrastructure to 
simultaneously produce hydrogen and sulfur. These studies involve 
experimental  or  pilot  plant  setups  [107,387,388]  and  conceptual 
designs  using  models  [217,376,389] .  Reed  [388]  retroﬁtted  an 
existing SRU Claus furnace with a ceramic tube mounted along the 
length of the furnace. This tube had cobalt-molybdenum catalyst, 
through which a portion (10%) of acid gas was passed through. In 
this way, the energy released within the Claus furnace was used 
2 yield (3.6%) was 
for H 
obtained, when the furnace temperature was 1403 K due to slow 
rate of heat transfer between the two ﬂuids. 

2 S cracking to produce hydrogen. A low H 

Cox  et  al.  [384]  came  up  with  two  innovative  processes  for 
H 
2 S  decomposition to  hydrogen. The  ﬁrst process was a  modiﬁ- 
cation of the steam methane reformer furnace. The hot gas from 
methane  oxidation  was  used  to  carry  out  the  decomposition  of 
H 
2 S stream received heat from the 
conventional Claus unit through a heat exchanger/decomposition 
reactor. Inside the heat exchanger, a single step kinetic model for 
2 S conversion and hydrogen yield

Fig. 38.  A simpliﬁed schematic diagram of the SRU with modiﬁed thermal section for H 2 production [217] . A portion of the acid gas is sent to the waste heat boiler (a heat 
exchanger) for H 2 S cracking to form H 2 using the heat energy of the gas exiting the furnace. 

at  1473  K.  Economic  analysis  was  done  on  both  the  processes. 
The authors concluded that ﬁrst process was better economically. 
The second process had a fairly less hydrogen yield of 22%. They 
also  concluded  that  hydrogen  from  H 
2 S  was  still  economically 
less  competitive  compared  to  the  conventional  steam  methane 
reforming process for producing hydrogen from natural gas. 

In  the  work  of  Ravikumar  et  al.  [217] ,  shown  in  Fig.  38 ,  a 
portion of the acid gas feed was sent to the waste heat boiler of 
a regular Claus process set up. This acid gas feed heat exchanged 
with the outlet of the Claus furnace. The process and set-up in this 
design  remained  the  same  with  the  conventional  Claus  furnace 
with only the water stream in WHB being replaced with a portion 
of the acid gas feed. Within the WHB, a detailed kinetic mecha- 
nism was proposed by them to calculate the formation of hydrogen 
2 S  decomposition.  They  also  showed  that  increasing  the 
from  H 
H 
2 S  oxidation  and  preheating  the  Claus  furnace  feed  increased 
the  hydrogen  yield  from  3  to  38%.  However,  economics  aspect 
2 S  stream  were  not  addressed. 
and  separation  of  hydrogen  in  H 
Dowling et al. [387] staged the H 
2 S thermal cracking by using a 
ceramic heat exchanger chamber within a traditional Claus furnace 
operating at pilot scale. A portion of feed to the Claus furnace (90% 
H 
2 ) was fed to the heat exchanger chamber. The product 
from the ceramic coils was directed to a rapid quench mechanism 
and  hydrogen  separation,  while  the  rest  was  recycled  back  to 
the Claus furnace feed. A temperature range of 1173–1473 K was 
set for the Claus furnace. They found that, at high temperatures, 
the  kinetics  of  H 
2 S  decomposition  was  equilibrium-controlled, 
whereas, at low temperatures, the usage of a catalyst would aid 
2 S.  The  hydrogen  yield  that 
the  formation  of  hydrogen  from  H 
could be managed with such a setup was only up to 35%, and this 
could be signiﬁcantly lower with more impurities in the acid gas 
stream because of the reduced furnace temperature. 

2 S, 10% CO 

2 S 
Adewale  et  al.  [389]  simulated  the  thermal  cracking  of  H 
using  ProMax® simulation  software  [174] .  Here,  they  modeled 
the commercial SRU process and retroﬁtted it with H 
2 S splitting 
scheme (where a portion of the acid gas feed stream was sent to 
cracking coils) according to the scheme proposed by Alberta Sulfur 
Research  Limited.  The  SRU  process  in  their  simulation  was  vali- 
dated with plant data and ﬁeld test results. They considered split 
fraction (fraction of acid gas feed stream sent to the cracking coils 
varying between 0–0.3) as an important parameter and conducted 
sensitivity analysis of the same with some design and operational 
aspects of the plant such as hydrogen production, steam produc- 
tion, Claus furnace temperature, overall sulfur recovery in primary 

SRU, burner ﬂame temperature, and the thermal energy require- 
ment.  Their  simulations  showed  that  the  hydrogen  produced 
increased linearly with the split fraction. For a speciﬁc case of feed 
split ratio of 0.245, an economic analysis showed that their retroﬁt 
study had a payback of less than four years and the amount of 
hydrogen produced was 326 tonnes per year. While their simula- 
tion study looks promising, the reactors were designed as Gibbs 
reactors  (based  on  equilibrium  considerations)  thereby  making 
model only mildly suitable for pilot plant and scale-up studies. 

Ghahraloud  et  al.  [376]  conducted  a  modelling  study,  where 
they modiﬁed the Claus furnace by placing a coil into the same; 
the  catalytic  reactors  were  modiﬁed  by  equipping  them  with 
hydrogen  selective  membrane  tubes.  Similar  to  all  other  works, 
a  portion  of  the  feed  was  directed  into  the  coil  directly,  where 
2 S cracking reactions using the heat of the Claus 
it underwent H 
furnace. This stream from the coil was then mixed with the Claus 
furnace  exit  stream.  The  catalytic  reactors  had  two  outlets:  one 
for  collecting  the  liquid  sulfur  and  other  for  the  hydrogen  gas. 
They also optimized their model with the combined objective of 
hydrogen  production  and  overall  sulfur  recovery.  Their  decision 
variables  included  feed  split  ratio,  inlet  temperatures  to  furnace 
and catalytic reactors, air and acid gas feed ﬂow, and membrane 
sweep  gas  temperature.  They  used  global  reaction  mechanism 
for the reactions in the Claus furnace. The results showed almost 
three times increase in the hydrogen yield compared to the con- 
ventional process followed by a marginal improvement in sulfur 
recovery. The main distinction of the work is in the fact that the 
issue  of  hydrogen  separation  was  addressed,  but  the  substantial 
modiﬁcations to the conventional process would involve signiﬁcant 
ﬁxed capital and operational costs. 

While  several  reported  studies  exist  for  hydrogen  production 
from H 
2 S, none of the studies have resulted in the industrial scale 
production  or  commercialization  of  the  same.  The  main  reasons 
for  these  include  low  hydrogen  yield,  heat  transfer  limitations, 
and separation of hydrogen from the acid gas streams. The future 
studies in this direction should focus not only on the innovative 
aspects  of  hydrogen  production  from  H 
2 S-rich  acid  gas  utilizing 
an  SRU  infrastructure,  but  should  also  identify  optimal  process 
conditions that can possibly maximize hydrogen yield.

clude metal oxides or metal sulﬁdes containing Co, Ni, Cu, Fe, Mo, 
Al, V, W, Ti. in either supported or non-supported versions [391–
395] . Alumina was used as supports in most cases because of its 
high temperature stability. The catalysts were used in specialized 
reactors for product removal such as membrane reactor, thermal 
diffusion reactor, and recirculating reactor [396] . While the yield 
2 S splitting using 
improved with catalysts, some limitations exist. H 
only  catalyst  (and  not  any  other  equilibrium  shifting  method) 
requires high temperature, almost same as that required for non- 
catalytic  reaction.  The  long  term  stability  of  catalysts  is  also  an 
important criterion hindering the commercialization of the process 
[397] .  The  complexity  of  specialized  reactor  design  also  makes 
the commercialization diﬃcult [395] , since the existing or built-in 
facilities and infrastructure of SRUs cannot be used [396] .

Some studies have shown that, under certain conditions, both 
syngas and sulfur can be produced from acid gas [355] , as it often 
has  high  percentage  of  CO 
2 .  Groisil  et  al.  [402]  used  a  detailed 
reaction  mechanism  to  obtain  a  set  of  optimum  conditions  for 
acid gas pyrolysis to produce syngas and sulfur. Their numerical 
simulation  was  validated  with  experimental  data.  The  optimum 
conditions, found by parametric sensitivity analysis, were: reactor 
2 S content in acid gas 
temperature range of 1550–1800 °C, and H 
less  than  60%.  They  also  showed  a  trade-off between  high  H 
2 S 
conversion  and  the  production  of  unwanted  sulfur  compounds 
between the temperature range of 150 0–160 0 °C. El-Melih et al. 
[108] studied acid gas pyrolysis in a reactor at 1250–1475 K with 
a high residence time of 2 s, and analyzed the eﬄuent gas stream 
using gas chromatography. The reactor temperature and acid gas 
composition were highlighted as the critical factors for producing 
syngas with varying H 

2 from H 

2 to CO ratio. 

Manenti  et  al.  [354]  invented  a  technology  (AG2S TM )  for  the 
2 S 
production of syngas from the endothermic reaction between H 
and  CO 
2  in  a  regenerative  thermal  reactor.  A  simpliﬁed  repre- 
sentation  of  the  process  is  provided  in  Fig.  39 ,  where  acid  gas 
reduction occurs in the regenerative thermal oxy-reduction reactor 
(RTR), and the eﬄuent gas eﬄuent is subsequently processed in 
a catalytic unit analogous to the SRU catalytic section. The energy 
for this reaction is obtained through the oxidation of a small part

Their  mechanism  included  not  only  H

experimental data for capturing the effects of H

2 and SO 
simulations at different residence times and temperatures to see 
the temporal evolution of syngas along with other undesired sulfur 
compounds  (COS,  CS 
2 )  along  the  reactor  length.  Their 
kinetic model provided deep insights on the aspects such as acid 
gas decomposition reactor design, optimization, and environmental 
emissions. However, their work was conceptual and experimental 
validation  of  their  claims  is  necessary.  To  conclude,  similar  to 
hydrogen production, the process for the development of syngas 
from acid gases is still in its nascent stage, suffer from low product 
yield, and its commercial scale development and implementation 
remain to be seen. 

2  and  SO 

5.2. Sulfur production from SO 2 

Off-gas/ﬂue  gas  streams  from  different  industries  such  as 
nonferrous metal smelters, rubber, phosphate-based fertilizers and 
coal-based  IGCC  power  plants  contain  relatively  high  amounts 
2 . While FGD predominantly exists in these industries such 
of SO 
as coal based power plants, its shortcomings include inability to 
2  concentration (above 
cost-effectively treat streams with high SO 
50 0 0 ppm) and management/disposal of solid wastes [403] . SO 
2 - 
rich streams are usually converted to sulfuric acid. With limited 
market for sulfuric acid, this process is seen as a means to control 
SO 
2 emission rather than a proﬁtable business [403] . Some indus- 
tries such as sulﬁde smelting plants even produce off-gas streams 
which contain very high amount of SO 
2 (35–45%) [404] . For such 
industries,  even  conversion  to  sulfuric  acid  requires  diluting  the 
SO 
2 )  which 
makes  this  process  highly  cost  intensive  [404] .  Thus,  given  the 
intricacies associated with dealing the SO 
2 laden ﬂue gas streams 
in these industries, a suitable approach in this regard is to convert 
2 to elemental sulfur [404] . Elemental sulfur is inert, non-toxic 
SO 
and is relatively easier to store and transport. 

2  rich  stream  to  lower  values  (to  about  10–14%  SO 

A  catalyst-based  chemical  reduction  of  SO 

2  to  sulfur  [405]  is 
promising,  as  it  does  not  lead  to  secondary  pollution  (e.g.,  high 
quantities  of  wastewater  generation  or  solid  waste  formation, 
which are diﬃcult to dispose). The dry reduction processes with 
or  without  the  catalyst  used  previously  were  Allied  Chemical 
Process,  Boliden  Process,  Lurgi  Process,  process  proposed  by 
Lawrence  Berkeley  Laboratory,  Direct  Sulfur  Recovery  Process 
(DRSP) developed at Research Triangle Institute, ASARCO process, 
and  Eisenlohr  process  that  are  detailed  in  [404] .  The  usage  of 
these  processes  was  highly  discouraged  due  to  the  high  costs 
associated with the reducing agent and the catalysts. This led to 
a ﬂurry of laboratory scale research activities over the past three 
decades to come up with a more suitable and appropriate catalyst

the most effective among all. The drawbacks of using carbon based

with  suitable  catalyst,  the  reaction  temperature  is  low  (500  °C), 
but  the  formation  of  COS  is  a  drawback  [408] .  With  hydrogen

as  the  reducing  agent,  the  catalysts  such  as  Ru/Al

[413] ,  bauxite  [414] ,  activated  carbon  [408] ,  and  Co-Mo/Al 
2 O 
3 
[412,415] were used. Similar to CO, hydrogen as a reducing agent 
with  suitable  catalyst  provides  a  lower  temperature  for  the  re- 
action.  H 
2 S  was  the  commonly  found  byproduct  for  the  case  of 
H 
2  as  the  reducing  agent.  The  availability  and  cost  associated 
with both CO and hydrogen happen to be the main limitations of 
using  them  as  reducing  agents  [416] .  To  combine  their  beneﬁts, 
syngas  can  also  be  used  as  a  reducing  agent  with  appropriate 
catalysts  such  as  iron  based  Al 
3  supported  catalyst  [417]  and 
2 O 
activated  carbon  [408] .  The  better  accessibility  and  relatively 
lower  price  have  made  methane  as  an  attractive  option  as  a 
reducing  agent  when  compared  with  CO,  hydrogen,  and  syngas. 
However, the reaction temperature is higher with methane. Some 
of  the  widely  investigated  class  of  catalysts  used  with  methane 
as reducing agent are bauxite [418] , alumina [419] , metal oxides 
and  sulﬁdes  supported  on  alumina  and  activated  carbon  [420] , 
ceria based catalysts [421] , transition metal sulﬁdes [422] , cobalt 
oxides  [423]  and  nickel  on  ceria-based  catalyst  with  lanthanum

temperature, feed ratio (SO 
time such that there is maximum conversion of SO 
2 to elemental 
sulfur with minimum byproduct formation. Some laboratory-scale 
testing has yielded success in increasing the SO

sulfur  selectivity.  For  instance,  SO 
2  conversion  and  selectivity  of 
3 –Ni  (10%)  as  the  catalyst 
about  99.5%  was  achieved  with  Al 
(with methane as the reducing agent) at optimal temperature of

mental sulfur have also come up from different or ganizations such 
as  Parsons  Corporation  (PROClaus  Process)  [425] ,  WorleyParsons

As  a  parallel  stream  of  activity,  when  compared  to  the 
2  to  elemental  sulfur,  some  novel 
catalyst-based  reduction  of  SO 
catalyst-free  desulfurization  studies  for  SO 
2 -rich  gas  have  also 
been  conducted.  Sohn  [404,431]  developed  a  new  method  for 
converting  high  concentration  of  SO 
2  to  elemental  sulfur  using 
CaS/CaSO 
4 cycles. This involved a cyclic process in 
2 is reacted with CaS or BaS. These act as a desulfu- 
which the SO 
2 is reduced to vapor form of elemental sulfur. CaS or 
rizer and SO 
BaS, in turn, are oxidized to solid CaSO 
4, respectively. The 
formed  CaSO 
4  are  reduced  using  reducing  agent  such 
4  or  BaSO 
as  hydrogen  to  CaS  or  BaS,  respectively.  The  pellet  form  of  the 
solid was also proposed by Sohn [432,433] . The advantages of this 
process included: no expensive catalyst and complete elimination 
of  solid waste and wastewater from the  process.  Because of  the 
technical diﬃculties in the process, a commercial implementation 
of  this  process  is  still  not  known  [403] .  Following  the  study  by 
Sohn, a desulfurization study was carried out using CaS along with 
quartz sand as a desulfurizer. The results showed that up to 99.5% 
SO 
2 removal eﬃciency was obtainable within a temperature range 
of 500–580 °C through an auto-thermal operation setup [403] . In 
another study, a conceptual methodology using a novel system of 
chemical looping combustion for recovering elemental sulfur from 
acid  gases  employing  calcium  based  oxygen  carriers  (CaS)  was 
developed  [434] .  Sulfur  can  be  formed  from  SO 
2  using  the  SO 
2 
disproportionation reaction in a sulfur-based thermochemical cycle 
with solar power [435] , since sulfur has almost 20 times higher 
solar energy storage capacity than molten salts. Further details on 
it are provided in the next section. 

5.3. Sulfur as energy vector 

The  low  demand  of  sulfur  and  its  ever-increasing  production 
have led researchers to look for alternate venues for its utilization. 
In [436] , a simulation study was presented where sulfur was used 
as  a  feed  for  a  power  plant,  involving  a  combustion  chamber 
2 ,  a  gas  turbine,  a  heat  recovery  steam 
to  convert  sulfur  to  SO 
generator, and a FGD unit. A schematic of the proposed process is 
shown in Fig. 40 . The sulfur-ﬁred power plant was compared to 
the natural gas-ﬁred power plant that was taken as a reference to 
compare the power outputs. The power generation in the sulfur- 
ﬁred plant depended on two exothermic reactions for energy: (a) 
2 with (cid:2)H o = −296.8 kJ/mol occurring in the com- 
2 → SO 
S + O 
bustor, and (b) CaCO 
2 (g) 
with (cid:2)H o = −324.2 kJ/mol occurring in the FGD. While the sug- 
gested method has an advantage of sulfur utilization, it involves 
the usage of a large quantity of limestone and the generation of

a  solid  byproduct,  CaSO 
4,  which  would  be  required  to  be  sold 
off. The mass ﬂow rate of sulfur required in the plant was higher 
than that of natural gas by a factor of about 4.7 to achieve the 
same combustion outlet temperature of 1443 °C at the exit of the 
combustor  as  obtained  in  the  natural  gas  case.  The  simulations 
suggest that the power plant running on sulfur has the potential 
to  produce  more  power  than  the  conventional  one  running  on 
natural  gas,  but  no  experimental  tests  have  been  performed  to 
3  in FGD, 
validate the idea. Due to the release of CO 
the overall emission of CO 
2 from the sulfur plant was higher than 
that  from  the  conventional  natural  gas  one  but  lower  than  that 
from a coal-ﬁred power plant. In 2016, a project titled “Renewable 
Power Generation by Solar Particle Receiver Driven Sulphur Storage 
Cycle” was funded by the European Union Research and Innovation 
programme  to  explore  the  possibility  of  using  sulfur  and  solar 
energy  to  generate  power  [437] .  Fig.  41  describes  the  proposed 
process, where sulfur is burnt in the combustion chamber of the 
2 is then sent to a 
gas turbine power plant, and the produced SO 
disproportionation reactor to convert it to sulfur and sulfuric acid 
4  + S at a temperature 
through the reaction, SO 
below 200 °C [438,439] . Sulfuric acid, thus produced, is converted 
to  SO 
2 O  using  a  reactor  operating  at  a  temperature 
2  is  sent  back  to  the  disproportionation 
above  800  °C,  and  SO 
reactor to convert it to sulfur. The heat required for the reactions 
is supplied using the millimeter-sized ceramic particles that have 
been heated through concentrated solar radiation to a temperature 
of  about  900  °C  (higher  than  the  temperature  needed  for  SO 
3 
dissociation) [440] . These heated particles are also used to evapo- 
rate sulfuric acid to SO 
3 can be catalytically 
3 and steam before SO 
dissociated into SO 
2 in the high temperature reactor. This 
is  an  advancement  over  the  state-of-the-art  molten  salt  solar 
power technology, when solar energy is stored in the molten salt. 
The idea is also discussed in [435] , where iodine was shown to 
be an effective catalyst for SO 
4 in the 
presence of water. The effects of temperature and pressure on this 
conversion reaction were studied, and it was concluded that low 
temperatures  and  high  pressures  favor  the  conversion  reaction.

Some works on ﬁndings new particles for dual purpose, i.e., solar

have also been reported [4 41,4 42] . For example, in [441] , modiﬁed

made  up  of  sintered  bauxite)  together  with  some  metal  oxides 
(oxides  of  iron,  copper,  manganese,  and  their  combinations)  of 
known catalytic activity, and were tested for their ability to store 
solar energy and catalyze SO

of about 60% (compared to the equilibrium value of 68%) at 850 °C 
and 1 atm pressure could be achieved.

energy  into  the  process,  and  mass  and  energy  balances  and  the

in [4 46,4 47] , the use of iodine was studied as an intermediate to

accounts  for  the  complex  radical  chemistry  in  the  high  temper- 
ature furnace. It is diﬃcult to develop reaction mechanisms and 
kinetic models that can be used for industrial process optimization 
utilizing atomistic simulations due to a large number of reactions 
taking place in such processes with chemical crosslinking among 
feed components. The available kinetic models have been devel- 
oped on the basis of a limited understanding of the combustion 
chemistry of H 
2 S. The global reaction models contain several rate 
parameters obtained by ﬁtting manually with limited experimental 
data sets. Such models predict reasonably well only for the set of 
conditions for which they were developed, and are not suitable for 
dynamic plant simulations. The reaction models based on detailed 
mechanism are very complex due to the large number of sensitive 
reactions  (with  uncertainty  in  rate  parameters)  that  dictate  the 
overall sulfur oxidation chemistry. Although the recent advances in 
chemical quantum calculations and some new experimental data 
have helped tremendously in improving the understanding of H 
2 S 
combustion chemistry and reliable model development, there are 
more major milestones that still need to be achieved. Firstly, there 
is a need of good experimental data on H 
2 S combustion as some 
of  the  available  ones  have  shown  wide  discrepancies  emanating 
from experimental uncertainties. The laminar burning velocity of 
H 
2 S measured at room temperature often show discrepancies as 
high  as  0.2–0.3  m/s  depending  on  the  equivalence  ratio  [122] . 
The  experimentally  observed  species  concentration  from  ﬂow 
reactor studies suffer from uncertainties emanating from catalytic 
reactions  on  the  surfaces  of  the  reactor,  particularly  at  low  or 
atmospheric pressures. These surface reactions still remain unclear 
and,  even  when  the  reactor  surfaces  are  coated  to  suppress  the 
catalytic reactions, some experimental data still cannot be mod- 
elled successfully due to the use of reactors, where the ﬂow is not 
laminar and one-dimensional and the data are only provided along 
the  reactor  centerline  [105] .  It  is  challenging  to  simulate  three- 
dimensional reactors with turbulence to validate a large reaction 

mechanism.  Moreover,  there  is  a  dearth  of  experiment  on  fuels 
with high concentrations of sulfur species. For example, acid gases 
2 S (and near 50%), but 
in industries usually contain above 30% H 
most lab-scale experiments are conducted with less than 10% H 
2 S 
(and near 1%) in feed. Though most sulfur recovery units combust 
acid gas comprising of both sulfur species and hydrocarbons that 
lead  to  organosulfur  species  formation,  very  limited  number  of 
studies  exist  on  them,  which  means  that  less  data  is  available 
to validate their models resulting in their combustion chemistry 
being  less  understood.  Secondly,  the  developed  kinetic  models 
contain several sensitive reactions with uncertain rate parameters 
that  have  been  obtained  under  very  limited  conditions  (e.g.,  at 
low temperatures and pressures). The rate parameters for most of 
the sensitive reactions have often required signiﬁcant adjustments 
to match the modeling results with the experimental data. Thus, 
quantum chemistry calculations are needed to be used more fre- 
quently in improving the reaction mechanisms. Novel experimental 
approaches can support such calculations by precisely identifying 
the chemical species important for sulfur combustion, investigating 
the elementary reactions, and determining the reaction rate con- 
stants. In addition, systematic studies are needed to investigate and 
adopt reliable reduction methods to simplify the complex reaction 
mechanisms  into  skeletal  schemes  that  can  be  coupled  directly 
with the ﬂuid dynamic models for industrial plant optimization. 

7. Conclusions 

The review highlights the experimental, theoretical, and mod- 
elling  studies  related  to  sulfur  combustion  that  have  assisted  in 
understanding  the  chemistry  of  sulfur  compounds  taking  place 
in  industrial  processes  to  improve  their  process  eﬃciency  and 
reduce  the  operating  and  capital  costs.  The  key  processes  for 
the  treatment  of  sulfur-rich  gas  are  sulfur  recovery  units  for 
2 , COS, mercaptans and other 
2 S, CS 
acid gas streams containing H

organosulfur  species  to  produce  sulfur,  ﬂue  gas  desulfurization 
2 -lean streams to produce gypsum, and sulfuric acid plants 
for SO 
2 ). Due to the low 
2 -rich streams (containing above 4% SO 
for SO 
economic values of the formed products, the processes are mainly 
adopted by industries for meeting the environmental emission reg- 
ulations rather than for revenue generation. Thus, there is a need 
to optimize such processes to reduce their operating costs through 
process  modelling  and  simulation,  which,  in  turn,  requires  the 
fundamental knowledge of sulfur chemistry. The plant tests on the 
operational sulfur recovery units have provided a wealth of data 
on the temperature and the species concentration at the reactor 
outlet to facilitate model validations, though they lack information 
on the spatial variation of species concentration inside the reactor. 
To  ﬁll  this  gap,  lab-scale  experiments  have  been  conducted  on 
H 
2 ,  mercaptans,  and  sulﬁdes  using  shock  tubes 
for  reaction  kinetics  and  ignition  delay  measurements,  laminar 
ﬂames for ﬂame speed and species and temperature proﬁles, and 
ideal  ﬂow  reactors  for  species  and  temperature  proﬁles  during 
oxidation and pyrolysis. Such studies have revealed the important 
reactions involved in the oxidation of sulfur species, their kinetics 
to support model development, and the discovery of organosulfur 
2 , and sulphurated PAHs. The discrepancies 
species such as COS, CS 
in the experimental data on ﬂame speed, ignition delay of sulfur 
species, and the kinetics of key reactions are highlighted.

The  need  to  have  a  model  to  simulate  sulfur  species  com- 
bustion  and  study  the  effects  of  inlet  and  physical  parameters 
on process eﬃciency have resulted in the development of global 
reaction models, whose rates are obtained from the experimental 
studies  or  by  ﬁtting  the  model  through  the  experimental  data. 
While they predict well the major species concentrations such as 
H 
2 O  at  the  end  of  the  reactors,  they  perform 
2 , and mercaptans, 
poorly for species such as CO, aromatics, COS, CS 
whose  production  or  destruction  is  kinetically-controlled.  There- 
fore, to develop reliable reaction mechanisms, quantum chemistry 
calculations have been utilized mostly from early 90 (cid:6) s to identify 
the sulfur reactions and ﬁnd their kinetics. Most studies have dealt 
with simple molecular systems that are most relevant to explain 
the initiation and propagation of sulfur combustion such as H-SO 
2 , 
H –H 
2 S, O –H 
2 S, H 
2 , disulfur species reactions, 
and COS, CS 
2 , and mercaptan reactions. One of the interesting ﬁnd- 
ings of such calculations was the formation of disulfur species such 
as HSS, HSSH, and H 
2 S combustion and pyrolysis. The 
inclusion of these species in the reaction mechanisms have signiﬁ- 
cantly improved their predictive capabilities. The interaction of sul- 
fur species with hydrocarbons have been studied to obtain kinetics 

2 S (and its radicals)-O 

2 SS during H 

2 , and mercaptans. At the same 
of the reactions leading to COS, CS 
time, such studies have also revealed that SO 
2 can oxidize aromatic 
compounds at high temperatures of the furnace that are otherwise 
harmful for the catalysts involved in the sulfur recovery units. 

The detailed mechanisms have been useful for the optimization 
studies  to  reduce  the  operating  costs  of  sulfur  recovery  units 
and have also helped in ﬁnding suitable operating conditions for 
2 S pyrolysis for hydrogen or 
oxygen-enriched combustion and for H 
syngas production. The computational ﬂuid dynamics and process 
optimization studies have been highlighted in the review, as they 
are  key  for  industries  to  design  burners  and  process  equipment 
and obtain suitable conditions to operate the plants. Such inves- 
tigations  have  mostly  relied  on  global  reaction  sets  to  save  on 
computational time. This highlights the need to develop reduced 
or  skeletal  reaction  mechanisms  from  the  detailed  mechanisms 
that  have  higher  range  of  applicability  and  better  predictive 
capability than the global reaction sets.

pyrolysis to produce H 
2  reduction to produce sulfur (using a reducing agent such as 
SO

CO, H 
number of methods have been suggested to produce H 
2 or syngas 
from  acid  gas,  the  need  for  high  energy  (for  cracking)  and  ex- 
pensive catalysts and low H 
2 yield have delayed their commercial 
production.  The  potential  to  use  sulfur  for  power  generation  or 
in  a  thermochemical  cycle  to  utilize  solar  energy  for  power  has 
also been discussed. With increasing discovery of sour oil and gas 
reservoirs  that  would  increase  the  production  of  acid  gases,  the 
studies highlighted in the latter part of the review on the innova- 
tive uses of H 
2 -rich gases and elemental sulfur, though 
presently in research-phase, are much needed for their better use 
and to identify them as economical sources of H 

2 S and SO 

2 and power.
