    "question_text": "Explain the thermodynamic basis of Liaw's model for predicting flash points of binary mixtures, focusing on how it incorporates Le Chatelier's rule and accounts for non-ideality through activity coefficients in vapor-liquid equilibrium. Describe the key equation and its components, and discuss how this model addresses extreme flash point behaviors in non-ideal mixtures.",
    "standard_answer": "Liaw's model is fundamentally based on thermodynamic vapor-liquid equilibrium principles and Le Chatelier's rule for flammability limits. The model's core equation is derived from the condition that at the flash point temperature, the vapor concentration of flammable components reaches the lower flammability limit (LFL) of the mixture. Le Chatelier's rule states that LFLmix = 1 / ∑(xi / LFLi), where LFLmix represents the lower flammability limit of the blend given in volume percent, where xi is the molar fraction of component i in the vapor phase (only accounting for ignitable compounds), and LFLi is the lower flammability limit of pure component i also expressed given in volume percent. This can be reformulated as ∑(yi / LFLi) = 1, where yi represents the molar fraction in the vapor phase. Under vapor-liquid equilibrium conditions, this becomes ∑(xiγiPsat_i(T)/Psat_i,fp(T)) = 1, where γi is the activity coefficient, xi is the liquid-phase mole fraction, Psat_i(T) is the saturation vapor pressure at temperature T, and Psat_i,fp(T) is the saturation pressure at the pure component's flash point. The activity coefficient models mentioned earlier (NRTL, Wilson, UNIFAC-based, UNIQUAC, van Laar, and Margules) can be used to estimate the activity coefficient, γi. After selecting an appropriate model, the FP temperature for a specific composition can be determined by solving Eq. (3). Activity coefficients quantify non-ideality: γi = 1 for ideal mixtures (Raoult's law), while deviations from unity capture positive or negative deviations from ideality. The model solves for temperature iteratively, ensuring the vapor-phase composition satisfies the LFL criterion. This approach accurately captures extreme behaviors by integrating real-fluid thermodynamics through activity coefficients, unlike simpler models that assume ideality and fail for non-ideal systems.",
