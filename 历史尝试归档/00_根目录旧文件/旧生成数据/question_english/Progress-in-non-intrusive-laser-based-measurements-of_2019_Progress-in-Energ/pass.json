    "standard_text": {
      "1": "There are four main coupling routes between the heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction pathways. The first mechanism is the promotion of homogeneous ignition due to the exothermicity of the catalytic pathway that heats up the channel walls and consequently the flowing gas. At the same time homogeneous ignition is inhibited by the near-wall depletion of the deficient reactant. A third mechanism of coupling is via the major species produced by the catalytic pathway over the gaseous induction zone. The fourth mechanism of coupling is via catalytic adsorption/desorption reactions of radical species.",
      "2": "The net effect is a moderate inhibition of homogeneous ignition via the hetero-/homogeneous radical coupling."
    },
    "standard_answer": "The four primary coupling mechanisms between heterogeneous and homogeneous chemistry in catalytic combustion systems are: (1) Thermal coupling through catalytic exothermicity - the heat released by surface reactions increases wall and gas temperatures, promoting homogeneous ignition by accelerating gas-phase reaction rates through Arrhenius temperature dependence. (2) Reactant depletion coupling - catalytic consumption of the deficient reactant near the wall creates transverse concentration gradients that reduce fuel availability for gas-phase reactions, thereby inhibiting homogeneous ignition. (3) Chemical inhibition/promotion by catalytic products - major species like H₂O produced catalytically can chemically inhibit homogeneous ignition in H₂/air mixtures while promoting it in CH₄/air mixtures through their influence on reaction pathways and radical pools. (4) Radical coupling through adsorption/desorption - while catalytic surfaces are poor net radical sources, they become efficient radical sinks when significant radicals are produced gas-phase, shifting from net-desorptive behavior upstream of ignition to net-adsorptive behavior near and after ignition. Collectively, these mechanisms create a complex balance where thermal promotion competes with chemical and radical inhibition. The exothermic heating tends to advance ignition, while reactant depletion and radical adsorption retard it, resulting in the homogeneous ignition position being determined by the net effect of these competing influences. The relative strength of each coupling mechanism depends on operating conditions, fuel type, and catalyst properties.",

    "question_text": "How does preferential diffusion of hydrogen relative to oxygen affect the catalytic equivalence ratio and surface temperatures in fuel-lean H₂/air combustion on platinum catalysts?",
    "standard_answer": "Preferential diffusion of hydrogen relative to oxygen significantly alters the local catalytic equivalence ratio and surface temperatures in fuel-lean H₂/air combustion due to the substantial difference in molecular diffusivities. Hydrogen has approximately 4 times higher diffusivity than oxygen in air, leading to enhanced transport of H₂ to the catalytic surface compared to O₂. This diffusional imbalance causes the local fuel-to-oxygen ratio at the catalyst surface to be approximately 2.4 times higher than the bulk gas equivalence ratio. The enhanced hydrogen concentration at the surface drives higher catalytic reaction rates and produces superadiabatic surface temperatures exceeding the adiabatic flame temperature. This phenomenon occurs because the preferential diffusion enriches the boundary layer with the more mobile hydrogen molecules, creating a locally fuel-rich environment at the catalyst despite the overall fuel-lean bulk mixture. The superadiabatic temperatures result from the combined effects of enhanced reaction rates due to hydrogen enrichment and the exothermic nature of catalytic oxidation. Conversely, for high hydrocarbon fuels (C₂+), the catalytic equivalence ratio becomes lower than the bulk gas equivalence ratio due to their lower diffusivities relative to oxygen, leading to underadiabatic surface temperatures. Turbulence moderates these preferential diffusion effects by equalizing species transport rates, further complicating the identification of the true deficient reactant in practical catalytic systems.",

    "question_text": "How does the competition between heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction pathways affect the homogeneous ignition distance in catalytic combustion systems, and what are the key controlling parameters?",
    "standard_answer": "The competition between heterogeneous (catalytic) and homogeneous (gas-phase) reaction pathways significantly influences the homogeneous ignition distance through multiple mechanisms. Heterogeneous reactions consume the deficient reactant near the catalytic wall, creating transverse stratification that depletes fuel concentration in the boundary layer. This depletion inhibits homogeneous ignition by reducing the available fuel for gas-phase reactions. Simultaneously, the exothermicity of catalytic reactions heats the gas through wall conduction, promoting homogeneous ignition by increasing local temperatures. The analytical criterion shows that homogeneous ignition distance ζ_ig,g depends on the catalytic Damköhler number Da_s and gas-phase Damköhler number Da_g through the relationship F(ζ_ig,g) = (1/2Pr)A/(Da_g,eff), where Da_g,eff = τ_d,eff/τ_ch,g. As Da_s increases (higher catalytic reactivity), the homogeneous ignition distance ζ_ig,g increases due to enhanced fuel consumption by the catalytic pathway. Conversely, increasing Da_g (higher gas-phase reactivity) decreases ζ_ig,g. The controlling parameters include the catalytic and gas-phase activation energies, wall-to-inlet temperature ratio, Lewis number of the deficient reactant, and the characteristic transverse diffusion time scale. The complex interplay creates isolines of constant ζ_ig,g for different combinations of Da_s and Da_g, demonstrating that multiple reactivity combinations can yield identical ignition distances.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The competition between the catalytic and gaseous pathways is evident in Fig. 10. For a given Da_s, the homogeneous ignition distance ζ_ig,g obviously decreases with increasing gas-phase reactivity Da_g. On the other hand, for a given Da_g a rise in the catalytic reactivity (Da_s) inhibits homogeneous ignition by increasing ζ_ig,g, since the catalytic pathway converts fuel at the expense of the gaseous pathway.",

    "standard_answer": "Local catalytic reaction rates in confined channel flows are determined through non-intrusive laser-based measurements of transverse species concentration profiles, particularly using spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. The catalytic molar reaction rate of the fuel, ̇s_F, is directly proportional to the transverse fuel gradient at the catalytic wall according to the relationship: (ρD_F ∂Y_F/∂y)_w = W_F ̇s_F. This fundamental equation shows that the fuel mass flux at the wall equals the catalytic reaction rate multiplied by the fuel's molecular weight. The normalized wall gradient (1/Y_F,IN)Y'_F,w serves as a direct measure of local catalytic activity since it is proportional to the catalytic reaction rate. This methodology requires spatially-resolved measurements across the channel height to capture the boundary layer profiles, which exhibit significant stratification with fuel concentration decreasing toward the catalytic wall due to heterogeneous reactions. The measurements are typically performed at conditions where the catalytic Damköhler number is below the ignition threshold to ensure the reaction rate changes appreciably with Damköhler number variations, allowing for meaningful kinetic investigations.",

For hydrogen oxidation (H₂ + 0.5O₂ → H₂O), use W_F = 0.002 kg/mol for H₂, W_O = 0.032 kg/mol for O₂, R = 8.314 J/mol·K. Determine the correct limiting reactant concentration considering the stoichiometric oxygen-to-fuel mass ratio of 8:1 for H₂ combustion, and explain the proper treatment when the stoichiometric-adjusted concentration difference becomes negative according to combustion kinetics principles.",
    "standard_answer": "The characteristic transverse diffusion time scale is calculated as τ_d = b²/α_th,IN = (0.0035 m)²/(2.5 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s) = 0.49 s. For the gas-phase chemical time τ_ch,g, we first determine the limiting reactant. The stoichiometric oxygen requirement for H₂ combustion is 8 kg O₂ per kg H₂. The available oxygen mass fraction relative to fuel is Y_O,IN/Y_F,IN = 0.20/0.05 = 4, which is less than the stoichiometric requirement of 8, indicating oxygen is the limiting reactant. The stoichiometric-adjusted oxygen concentration term is Y_O,IN - (W_Oν_O/W_F)Y_F,IN, where ν_O = 0.5 (molar basis) and the mass-based stoichiometric coefficient is W_Oν_O/W_F = (0.032×0.5)/0.002 = 8. This gives 0.20 - 8×0.05 = 0.20 - 0.40 = -0.20. In combustion kinetics, when this stoichiometric-adjusted concentration difference becomes negative, it indicates fuel-rich conditions where the deficient reactant (oxygen) is fully consumed. The correct approach is to use the absolute value of this negative difference in the chemical time calculation, as it represents the effective limiting concentration that drives the reaction rate. Now calculating τ_ch,g = [B_g (pW_F/R)^(1-n_F) W_O^(-n_O) T_w^(1+γ-n_F+n_O) (Y_F,IN)^(n_F) (|Y_O,IN - W_Oν_O Y_F,IN/W_F|)^(n_O) exp(-E_g/RT_w)]^(-1): pW_F/R = (10×10⁵ Pa)(0.002 kg/mol)/(8.314 J/mol·K) = 240.6 kg·K/J, (pW_F/R)^(1-n_F) = (240.6)^0 = 1, W_O^(-n_O) = (0.032)^(-0.5) = 5.59 mol^(0.5)/kg^(0.5), T_w^(1+γ-n_F+n_O) = (1200)^(1+0-1+0.5) = (1200)^(0.5) = 34.64 K^(0.5), (Y_F,IN)^(n_F) = (0.05)^1 = 0.05, (|Y_O,IN - W_Oν_O Y_F,IN/W_F|)^(n_O) = (|-0.20|)^(0.5) = (0.20)^(0.5) = 0.447, exp(-E_g/RT_w) = exp(-150000/(8.314×1200)) = exp(-15.03) = 3.06×10⁻⁷. Thus τ_ch,g = [10¹⁰ × 1 × 5.59 × 34.64 × 0.05 × 0.447 × 3.06×10⁻⁷]^(-1) = [10¹⁰ × 1.33×10⁻⁷]^(-1) = [1330]^(-1) = 7.52×10⁻⁴ s. The gas-phase Damköhler number is Da_g = τ_d/τ_ch,g = 0.49 s / 7.52×10⁻⁴ s = 651. This high Damköhler number indicates fast gas-phase chemistry relative to diffusion, suggesting potential for homogeneous ignition. The correction using the absolute value ensures proper handling of the limiting reactant in fuel-rich conditions where oxygen is deficient and fully consumed.",
