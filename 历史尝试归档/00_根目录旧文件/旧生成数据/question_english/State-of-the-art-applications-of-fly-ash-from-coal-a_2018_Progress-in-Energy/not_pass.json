    "question_text": "According to the volatilization-condensation mechanism during coal combustion at high temperatures (400°C–1500°C), how are elements distributed between Group I (lithophiles) and Group II (chalcophiles) based on their enrichment behavior in fly ash particles, and what implications does this elemental distribution have for the chemical composition and classification of Class F and Class C fly ashes?",
    "standard_answer": "The volatilization-condensation mechanism during coal combustion at high temperatures (400°C–1500°C) creates distinct elemental distribution patterns in fly ash particles. Group I elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti), classified as lithophiles, show little or no enrichment in smaller fly ash particles and remain relatively evenly distributed across particle sizes. In contrast, Group II elements (As, Cd, Mn, Pb, Sb, and Se), defined as chalcophiles, display increasing concentration with decreasing particle size, becoming enriched in the finer fly ash fractions. This differential enrichment behavior directly impacts fly ash classification: Class F fly ash, produced predominantly from bituminous and anthracite coal combustion, contains high total SiO₂, Fe₂O₃, and Al₂O₃ content (>70%) with CaO content <5% and high unburned carbon (≈6.0% up to 12%), while Class C ash from peat and lignite combustion contains CaO content >20% with low unburned carbon. The volatilization-condensation mechanism explains why finer fly ash fractions become enriched in glass phases containing Group II elements, while coarser fractions retain minerals like mullite, quartz, and lime. These compositional differences determine utilization applications, with Class F's high silica-alumina content providing excellent pozzolanic properties for cement replacement, while Class C's high calcium content gives it self-cementing characteristics.",

    "question_text": "How do combustion temperature conditions affect the formation mechanisms and elemental distribution in fly ash from coal and biomass, and what are the implications for zeolite synthesis processes?",
    "standard_answer": "Combustion temperature conditions significantly influence fly ash formation through distinct mechanisms that determine elemental distribution patterns. For coal fly ash, the volatilization-condensation theory explains how elements are classified into three groups based on their enrichment behavior in fly ash particles. Group I elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti) show little or no enrichment in smaller fly ash particles; Group II elements (As, Cd, Mn, Pb, Sb, and Se) display increasing concentration with decreasing particle size; and Group III elements (Be, Cu, Ni, V, and Co) exhibit intermediate behavior, being enriched in smaller particles but to a lesser extent than elements in Group II. For biomass combustion, temperature-dependent transformations include combustion of organic materials at 200°C–850°C, fragmentation of particles at 500°C, agglomeration and growth of particles between 700°C and 1300°C, and melt glass formation at 700°C–1500°C. These temperature-controlled mechanisms directly impact the chemical composition and mineral phases present in fly ash, which are critical factors determining the suitability of fly ash as a precursor material for zeolite synthesis through hydrothermal processes. The specific elemental distributions and glass content resulting from combustion conditions affect the dissolution rates and reactivity during zeolite crystallization steps, with higher glass content generally enhancing reactivity for zeolite formation.",
