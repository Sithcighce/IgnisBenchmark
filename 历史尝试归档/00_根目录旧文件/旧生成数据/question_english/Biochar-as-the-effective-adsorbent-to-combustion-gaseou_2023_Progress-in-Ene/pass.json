    "question_text": "How does the presence of moisture in flue gas enhance SO2 adsorption on biochar through both physical and chemical mechanisms, and what role does the formation of a liquid membrane play?",
    "standard_answer": "Moisture enhances SO2 adsorption on biochar through multiple mechanisms. Physically, water vapor accumulates on biochar surfaces and pores, forming a liquid membrane that facilitates SO2 dissolution, increasing its concentration at active sites and promoting diffusion into micropores. Chemically, the adsorbed water reacts with SO2 and oxygen to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) via oxidation to SO3, which then hydrates. This acid can further react with inorganic components in biochar, such as calcium oxides, to form stable sulfates, enhancing chemisorption. The liquid membrane acts as a medium for these reactions, improving mass transfer and providing a pathway for SO2 to access internal pores and functional groups. However, excessive humidity (>50%) can reduce adsorption by blocking pores or competing for active sites, highlighting an optimal moisture range for maximum efficiency.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The H2O accumulated on the surface and interior pores of biochar favors the formation of a liquid membrane which would lead to the SO2 adsorbed by biochar easier than the adsorption in gas-solid reaction.",
      "2": "If the SO2, O2, and H2O were all adsorbed on the surface of biochar, the SO2 was first physically adsorbed onto the biochar, then oxidized to SO3 and transformed to H2SO4."

    "question_text": "Why do nitrogen-containing functional groups on biochar become more influential than pore texture for SO2 adsorption at elevated temperatures (~120°C), and how do these groups facilitate chemisorption?",
    "standard_answer": "At elevated temperatures (~120°C), physisorption diminishes due to reduced van der Waals interactions and increased molecular kinetic energy, making pore texture less effective. Nitrogen-containing functional groups, introduced via ammonia or amine modification, dominate chemisorption by acting as Lewis bases that donate electrons to the electrophilic sulfur atom in SO2. This forms stable complexes, such as sulfates or sulfites, through reactions like R2CH3N + SO2 + 1/2 O2 + H2O → (R2CH3NH)2·SO4. The pre-oxidation of biochar creates oxygenated anchoring sites that enhance nitrogen incorporation, further boosting chemisorption. These groups provide active sites that are thermally stable and facilitate chemical bonding, overcoming the limitations of physical adsorption at higher temperatures.",

    "question_text": "How do redox reactions of metal catalysts and oxygen vacancies in functionalized biochar enhance NOx removal performance in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, and what is the role of NH3 adsorption ability in this process?",
    "standard_answer": "In biochar-based SCR catalysts, the redox reactions of metal catalysts and the formation of oxygen vacancies significantly enhance NOx removal performance through improved catalytic activity and NH3 adsorption. The redox reactions of metal catalysts in biochar, particularly transition metals like Mn and Ce, facilitate electron transfer and oxidation processes that convert NO to more reactive species. Oxygen vacancies created during functionalization adsorb oxygen from the flue gas to form chemisorbed oxygen, which is more active and has higher mobility than lattice oxygen, playing an important role in catalytic reactions. These oxygen vacancies and redox-active sites improve the adsorption ability of NH3 on the biochar surface, where NH3 can bind to both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. The enhanced NH3 adsorption capacity, combined with the redox activity, enables more efficient reaction with NO according to the standard SCR reaction (4NH3 + 4NO + O2 → 4N2 + 6H2O), leading to higher NO conversion efficiencies, particularly at low temperatures where traditional catalysts are less effective.",

Explain the roles of bulk diffusion, surface diffusion, and Knudsen diffusion in this context, and describe how pore size relative to the mean free path of gas molecules influences the dominant diffusion mechanism in microporous biochar.",
    "standard_answer": "The hierarchical pore structure in biochar enables efficient transport and adsorption of gaseous pollutants from combustion flue gas. Macropores (>50 μm) function as primary conduits for bulk diffusion, allowing rapid mass transfer of gas molecules from the flue gas stream into the biochar interior. Mesopores (2–50 μm) serve as transmission channels where surface diffusion predominates, guiding molecules toward adsorption sites. Micropores (<2 μm) are the main physisorption sites where volume filling occurs due to enhanced adsorption potentials from overlapping van der Waals forces, rather than layer-by-layer coverage. In microporous biochar, Knudsen diffusion becomes the primary transport mechanism when pore sizes are smaller than the mean free path of gas molecules, causing frequent molecular collisions with pore walls to govern transport. This diffusion regime is particularly relevant for biochar with dominant microporosity, where the Knudsen diffusion coefficient can be predicted from kinetic theory by correlating biochar pore size with the adsorbate's mean free path. The hierarchical arrangement ensures optimal accessibility to active sites while maintaining efficient mass transfer throughout the pore network.",

    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, calculate the theoretical SO2 adsorption capacity of biochar functionalized with 8% MDEA, considering that the nitrogen-containing functional groups generated are mainly C–N with conversion to N–H groups. The biochar has a nitrogen content of 5 wt%, and the molecular weights are: N = 14 g/mol, SO2 = 64 g/mol. Explain why the theoretical capacity differs from the experimental value of 156.22 mg/g at 100°C, and discuss how nitrogen functionalities influence SO2 capture compared to pore texture under these conditions.",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate the theoretical SO2 adsorption capacity, first determine the moles of nitrogen per gram of biochar. With 5 wt% nitrogen, that is 0.05 g N per g biochar. The molar mass of N is 14 g/mol, so moles of N per g biochar = 0.05 / 14 = 0.00357 mol/g. Assuming all nitrogen is in the form of C–N and N–H groups (as per the paper's description for MDEA-functionalized biochar) and each nitrogen site can adsorb one SO2 molecule, moles of SO2 adsorbed per g biochar = 0.00357 mol N/g × 1 mol SO2/mol N = 0.00357 mol SO2/g. The molecular weight of SO2 is 64 g/mol, so theoretical adsorption capacity = 0.00357 × 64 = 0.22848 g SO2/g biochar, or 228.48 mg/g. However, this theoretical value (228.48 mg/g) exceeds the experimental value of 156.22 mg/g at 100°C because not all nitrogen sites are equally effective or accessible for SO2 adsorption. Factors such as pore blockage from MDEA impregnation, incomplete conversion of nitrogen groups to active forms, and diffusion limitations reduce the practical capacity. The paper states that with MDEA concentration higher than 8%, 'the micropore structure nearly collapsed completely meanwhile much of nitrogen-containing functional groups (mainly C–N) were generated, the chemical adsorption was dominant', and 'the nitrogen functionalities onto the biochar are more influential than the pore texture for the adsorption of SO2, with the conversion to N–H groups'. This indicates that chemisorption via nitrogen groups dominates over physisorption in micropores when nitrogen content is high, as these groups provide active sites for chemical bonding with SO2, leading to higher capacities than pore texture alone, even with collapsed pores.",
