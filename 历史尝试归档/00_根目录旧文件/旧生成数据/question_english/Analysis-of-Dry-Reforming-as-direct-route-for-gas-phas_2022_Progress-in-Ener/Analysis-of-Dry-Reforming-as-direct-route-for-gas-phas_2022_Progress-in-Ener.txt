Transition to low carbon societies requires advanced catalysis and reaction engineering to pursue green routes
for  fuels  and  chemicals  production  as  well  as  CO2  conversion.  This  comprehensive  review  provides  a  fresh
perspective on the dry reforming of methane reaction (DRM) which constitutes a straightforward approach for
effective  CO2  conversion  to  added value  syngas.  The  bottleneck  for the  implementation  of  this  process  at in-
dustrial scale is the development of highly active and robust heterogeneous catalysts able to overcome the CO2
activation barrier and deliver sufficient amount of the upgrading products at the desired operation conditions.
Also, its high energy demand due to the endothermic nature of the reaction imposes extra difficulties. This review
critically discusses the recent progresses on catalysts design ranging from traditional metal-supported catalysts to
advanced structured and nanostructured systems with promising performance. The main advantages and culprits
of the different catalytic systems are introduced aiming to inspire the catalysis community to further refine these
formulations towards the development of “supercatalysts” for DRM.  Besides the design of increasingly complex
catalyst morphologies as well as other promising alternatives aiming at reducing the energy consumption of the
process or tackle deactivation through reactor design are introduced.

1. Introduction

Population  growth  and  economic  development  are  driving  up  the
global  energy  demand.  In  2018,  energy  consumption  worldwide
increased  by  2.3%  which  corresponds  to  a  growth  rate  double  the
average growth rate since 2010 [1]. Considering that today the main
sources of energy are non-renewable and based on the consumption of
petroleum  products,  research  is  now  focused  on  alternative  energy
sources, clean and as efficient as oil derivate. In the context of global
warming, reducing the impact on the environment has become essential,
especially by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The growth in energy
consumption in 2018 led to a rise in CO2 emissions of 1.7%, reaching an
all-time high record [1]. In 1750, the CO2  concentration in the atmo-
sphere was estimated at 277 ppm [2] and reached concentrations as high
as 415 ppm in October 2021 [3]. In recent years, initiated by the Kyoto
protocol of 1997, more efforts have been made by national governments
to  implement  greenhouse  gases  mitigation  solutions.  However,  the
target set by ‘The Paris Agreement’ of limiting the global average tem-
◦
perature to below 2
C above pre-industrial levels is ambitious and much
more is to be done. To reach this target by 2100, the IEA predicts that

CO2 emissions should be limited to 13.3 Gt of CO2 by the year 2050 [4].
The Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) approach, where CO2  is
captured, converted and recycled back to fuels and added value chem-
icals tackles CO2 emissions in an active and sustainable way. Syngas is a
valuable  intermediate  resource  used  for  the  production  of  methanol,
hydrogen  and  subsequently  ammonia.  It  is  also  used  in  the  Fischer–-
Tropsch (FT) process whereby a variety of hydrocarbon fractions can be
produced.  Depending  on  the  syngas  composition,  catalyst  used,  and
reaction conditions, alkanes, alkenes and alcohols of various length can
be  synthesised,  resulting  in  the  production  of  a  variety  of  chemicals:
gasoline, diesel  fuel, jet  fuel  or waxes [5].  Syngas is  traditionally ob-
tained  through  the  steam  reforming  of  methane  yielding  syngas  mix-
tures mainly comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide (H2/CO of ca.
3)  with  some  carbon  dioxide  and  residual  methane.  However  down-
stream  processes  may  require  different  syngas  composition,  like  the
methanol  synthesis  which  requires  a  H2/CO  of  2-2.1.  Reforming
methane with CO2, via the dry reforming reaction (DRM), yields H2/CO
ratio close to unity and is of interest to both adjust the syngas compo-
sition  and  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  reforming  by  allowing  the
abatement of two of the most abundant greenhouse gases.

In DRM however, high temperatures (>800

C) are required for the
complete  conversion  of  reactants  and  this  energy  intensive  constrain
brings  two  challenges  for  the  reforming  catalyst:  the  sintering  of  the
active phase and the carbon poisoning initiated by numerous side re-
actions [6]. Additionally, to integrate DRM with downstream processes,
operation at pressures between 20 and 70 bars is encouraged to reduce
the  number  of  highly  expensive  compression  steps  [7].  According  to
thermodynamics, higher pressures, especially above 10 bars favour the
production of solid carbon on the surface of the catalyst, and conversions
are  decreased  with  pressure.  Thus,  for  an  industrial  implementation,
there is a need to develop a cost-effective catalyst, able to withstand high
temperatures and able to resist deactivation due to coking and sintering.
In this regard, extensive research has been conducted to produce stable
catalysts  for  DRM.  Many  reviews  precede  this  one,  focusing  on  the
fundamentals  of  catalyst  design,  especially  on  promoters  and  support
effect in conventional supported catalysts [8–12]. This review aims to
introduce  the  challenges  specific  to  DRM  in  terms  of  thermodynamic
limitations  and  catalyst  deactivation  phenomena.  The  well-studied
supported  catalysts formulations are reviewed, and  emphasis is given
to  the  newly  reported  creative  catalyst  designs.  Indeed,  rather  than
varying the composition of the various components of the catalyst, new
approaches  focus  on  the  structure  and  morphology  of  the  catalyst,
aiming  to  fix  and  protect  the  active  particles  through  a  confinement
effect  or  a  substitution.  Finally,  alternatives  to  thermal  catalysis  are
listed to perform DRM with potentially higher efficiencies and reduced
environmental impact.

2. History

In terms of materials, the reaction between hydrocarbons and metals
was  already  observed  in  1817  by  Davy  during  an  experiment  with  a
wire-gauze safety lamp, before the concept of catalysis was even intro-
duced  [13].  He  particularly  observed  that  a  carbonaceous  matter
destroyed  the  igniting  power  of  platinum  and  that  palladium  lost  its
properties due to a coating of ‘sulphuret’, witnessing the main issues that
will  later  encounter  reforming  reactions:  coking  and  poisoning  by
sulphur  [13,14].  The  production  of  H2  from  hydrocarbons  and  steam
over calcium oxide was observed in 1868, forming calcium carbonate.
The use of nickel for this reaction was later patented in 1889 [14]. Lang
performed several experiments in 1888 in the laboratory of Prof. Nau-
mann,  including  the  reduction  of  CO2  by  CH4,  the  steam  methane
reforming (SMR) and various experiments on the gasification of carbon

◦

using steam, oxygen or CO2. In particular, he performed DRM on Cu and
described that the reduction of CO2 only started between 700 and 800
C
[15]. Neumann et al. published a complete study in 1924 on the Sabatier
reaction and the reaction of steam and methane. They used a nickel and
magnesia-based catalyst and reached complete conversion of methane at
◦
around 1000
C [16]. Soon after, DRM was thoroughly studied by Fischer
and Tropsch in 1928 [17]. They performed the reaction on various base
metal catalysts, nickel and cobalt being the most promising ones. Severe
deactivation due to carbon deposition was however observed, and re-
searchers have been focused on tackling this problem ever since. To this
date  however  (almost  a  hundred  years  later),  there  is  no  established
industrial  DRM  plant,  mainly  due  to  the  carbon  formation  occurring
when steam is not alimented in the reaction.

On the other hand, steam reforming was industrially introduced in
1930 by Standard Oil of New Jersey. The technology went through an
industrial  break-through  in  the  1960s  when  tubular  reformers  were
successfully  operating  at  high  pressures,  decreasing  significantly  the
cost and energy consumption of downstream processes such as ammonia
and methanol synthesis [18]. Depending on the feedstock available in
each  country,  naphtha  and  natural  gas  steam  reforming  plants  were
implemented.  Although  DRM  is  not  developed  at  large  scale  yet,
reforming processes using CO2  rich gas are in operation and Figure 1
depicts an example of a simplified flow sheet. The addition of CO2 in the
feed stream is a way to control and adjust the distribution of products
and hence the H2/CO ratio, thus, allowing to tailor the syngas compo-
sition  for  diverse  downstream  processes.  Many  issues  accompany  the
reforming of naphtha such as carbon formation and sulphur poisoning of
the  catalyst.  Natural  gas  contains  between  5  and  20  ppm  of  sulphur
where liquid hydrocarbons can contain up to 500 ppm [19]. The pri-
mary  layer  of  catalyst  would  be  poisoned  by  sulphur,  permitting
unreacted naphtha to enter the hot zone of the reformer tubes where
carbon  would  form  through  pyrolysis and  cause the  formation  of  hot
tubes. As a result, a limit of 10 ppb of sulphur content was estimated in
the 1970s and a hydrodesulphurisation process was introduced to pro-
tect the reforming catalyst from sulphur poisoning.

The pre-reformer was introduced in the 1980s and converts, at low
temperatures, the higher hydrocarbons before entering the preheater,
thus allowing to preheat at high temperatures without risks of pyrolysis
[18].  This  unit  is  indispensable  to  comply  with  the  variety  of  hydro-
carbon feedstock composition. All higher hydrocarbons are converted to
hydrogen, carbon oxides and methane thus eliminating the larger risk of
in  the  tubular  reformer  caused  by  higher
carbon  deposition

hydrocarbons.  Moreover,  any  remaining  poison  in  the  desulphurised
feed will be picked up by the pre-reformer catalyst, thus protecting the
primary  reformer  catalyst.  Additionally,  the  pre-reformer  operates  at
◦
rather low temperature, generally around 500
C, where carbon depo-
sition  is  unlikely  to  take  place  [20].  Overall,  the  addition  of  a
pre-reformer results in lower tube wall temperatures in the reformer and
longer lifetime of the tubes and the catalyst. The reformer is the most
critical and expensive unit of the process. In order to operate at high
temperatures,  high  alloy  steel  tubes  are  required  to  ensure  good  me-
chanical strength and corrosion resistance which are extremely expen-
sive thus increasing the overall capital cost. The lifetime of the tubes
depends highly on the temperature and therefore on the catalyst activity
◦
and  deactivation.  A  deviation  of  30
C  from  the  designed  operating
conditions can reduce the lifetime of the tubes from 100 000 hours to 25
000 [20]. Heat transfer mechanisms, and especially the radiation inside
the  tubes,  cause  temperature  gradients  throughout  the  reformer  and
influence the gas composition [21].

Later,  the  SPARG  (Sulphur  PAssivated  ReforminG)  process  was
introduced by Haldor-Topsoe in the 1980s to tackle Ni catalyst deacti-
vation by carbon deposition. In this process, sulphur is injected in the
feed stream to poison a portion of the most active sites to prevent carbon
formation,  while  the  remaining  sites  maintain  some  activity  for
reforming [19]. Sulphur passivation is a size-selective technique where
sulphur  selectively  poison  large  particles.  When  the  Ni  surface  is
completely  covered by  sulphur, adsorbed carbon cannot dissolve into
the Ni lattice, which blocks the whisker growth mechanism. Since car-
bon  formation occurs  preferably  on  larger ensembles  than  reforming,
sulphur  passivation  inhibits  carbon  formation  more  than  it  does
reforming [22]. Using sulphur to passivate Ni and avoid cocking may
sounds counter-productive since sulphur could lead to the formation of
nickel  sulphide  which  is  an  inactive  phase  for  reforming  reactions.
Nevertheless, this promotion by  poisoning strategy is completely suc-
cessful but it must be carried out carefully by controlling the amount of
sulphur (typically at the ppb levels) to avoid the formation of inactive
nickel sulphides.

In  1986,  the  CALCOR  process  was  patented  by  Caloric  [23].  This
process  aims  to  produce  pure  carbon  monoxide  and  is  based  on  CO2
reforming. The fuel is first hydrogenated and desulphurised. Then, it is
mixed with CO2 and reformed to syngas. The stream is then cooled, and
CO2 is removed, absorbed by MEA and recovered. The obtained syngas is
typically composed of 70 vol.% CO and 30 vol.% H2. Hydrogen is then
separated and recycled yielding carbon monoxide of up to 99.99 vol.%
purity, depending on the purification system, membrane unit or cold box
unit [24].

Several plants for CO2-rich reforming are currently in operation. A
full size monotube pilot plant of dimensions comparable to an industrial
scale reforming plant is functioning in Houston, USA. This pilot plant
(cid:0) 1 and utilises a
runs with a natural gas feed in the range of 60-120 m3 h
Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst. Several primary reformer feed were experimented
for times on stream of around 500 hours [19]. Linde recently inaugu-
rated a pilot plant in Pullach, Germany to reform CO2-rich gas to syngas.
Some industrial plants are also in operation, producing between 2400
(cid:0) 1 of dry syngas. In Japan, a plant is currently using a
and 133000 m3 h
Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst to reform natural gas at low pressure to produce a
syngas with a H2/CO ratio of unity. The reformer’s feed contains up to
56 mol.% of CO2. Plants in South Korea, India and the UK are reforming
naphtha  feed  stock  containing  C6-C12  hydrocarbons  and  use  a
pre-reformer.  They  operate  at  pressures  between  20  and  25  bars  and
produce syngas of H2/CO ratio of 1.7-2.1. Plants are also present in Iran,
Indonesia  and  Malaysia,  reforming  natural  gas  with  a  Ni/MgAl2O4
catalyst. Lastly, an industrial plant in USA applies the SPARG technology
on that same catalyst to reform natural gas [19].

3. Thermodynamics

From the thermodynamic point of view, DRM (eq. 1) and SRM (eq. 2)

are highly endothermic reactions and as a result, require elevated tem-
peratures to shift the equilibrium towards the syngas product.

One way to decrease the enthalpy change of reaction is to use oxygen
as oxidant through the Partial Oxidation of Methane (POM, eq. 3), also
called Oxy reforming. In addition to favourable thermodynamics, POM
is attractive for its fast reaction kinetics, excellent syngas selectivity at
very short contact times and for its H2/CO ratio of 2, ideal for methanol
production  or  Fischer  Tropsch  synthesis.  However,  temperature  dis-
parities in the catalyst bed may result from the high conversion com-
bined  with  high  space  velocity  which  ultimately  may  cause  catalyst
deactivation  due  sintering  and  hence  to  carbon  deposition.  This  may
turn the process very exothermic and thereby raise safety concerns [25].
The combination of SRM and POM on the other hand, does not require
any  external  source  of  heat  and  thus  is  referred  as  autothermal
reforming (ATR, eq. 4).

298K = (cid:0) 6.8 kJ mol(cid:0) 1

The  use  of  CO2  as  oxidant  is  of  interest  to  reduce  the  impact  of
anthropogenic emissions. DRM alone produces a syngas of about equi-
molar  H2  and  CO.  To  increase  the  hydrogen  content  in  the  produced
syngas, the  coupling  of  DRM and  SRM  is  possible  and  referred  as  Bi-
Reforming  of  Methane  (BRM,  eq.  5).  Similarly,  the  Tri-Reforming  of
Methane (TRM, eq. 6) is the combination of SRM, DRM and POM and
benefits from friendly thermodynamics, leading to optimised efficiency
and hydrogen rich synthetic gas [26].

The  combination  of  all  those  gases  allows  for  numerous  side  re-
actions  to  occur.  Inevitably,  the  Reverse  Water  Gas  Shift  reaction
(RWGS, eq. 7), which is an equilibrium limited reaction, occurs. This
reaction  is  often  responsible  for  lower  hydrogen  concentration  in  the
syngas due to its consumption of part of the H2 produced to reduce CO2
to  CO.  Additionally,  several  reactions  producing  carbon  residues  are
favoured  throughout  the  entire  spectrum  of  temperatures.  The  Bou-
douard reaction eq. 8), CO and CO2 reductions (eq. 9 and (10) and CH4
decomposition  (eq.  11)  are  responsible  for  the  coking  and  resulting
deactivation of reforming catalysts.

Nikoo et al. performed a thourough thermodynamic study on DRM,
focusing on the formation of solid carbon. They considered 17 possible
reactions  that  may  occur  in  DRM  conditions [27].  According  to  ther-
modynamic principles, a reaction is spontaneous when the Gibbs free
energy  change  of  that  reaction  (ΔG0

Figure 2 represents the evolution with temperature of the equilib-
rium  constant  of  the  aforementioned  reactions  eq.  1)  and  (eq.  7-(11)
calculated by Nikoo et al. The DRM reaction, as expected, is favoured at
◦
temperature above 650
C. However, in this temperature range, methane
decomposition is also highly favoured as well as the RWGS reaction. The
Boudouard reaction eq. 8), CO and CO2  reductions (eq. 9-(10) on the
◦
other hand are unlikely to occur at temperatures above 700
C, although
a change in reactant proportion may affect their occurrence since their
◦
Ln(K) is rather low in the 700
C range [27]. In view of these data, carbon
deposition during DRM is likely to be mainly due to CH4 decomposition
(eq. 11).

◦

The thermodynamic equilibrium composition plots  for DRM, BRM
anf TRM are shown in Figure 3. In every case, full conversion of CH4 and
CO2 is obtained at temperature above 800
C. Carbon deposition occurs
throughout the whole temperature range but seems mitigated at very
high temperature and in the presence of steam (BRM). The H2 produc-
tion  is  significantly  enhanced  by  the  addition  of  steam  and  oxygen,
increasing at the same time the H2/CO ratio of the produced syngas. A
detailed thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of biogas reforming pro-
cesses  under  different  feed  composition  -  CH4/CO2  ratio,  steam  and
oxygen content - can be found in reference [28].

4. Reaction mechanism and kinetics

◦

High CH4  and CO2  conversions towards syngas are thermodynami-
C (Figure 3). In this temper-
cally possible at temperatures above 800
ature range, methane decomposition is a favoured side reaction, hence
carbon residue formation is favoured. To achieve long term operations,
the reforming must then kinetically hinder carbon formation. In order to
understand the behaviour of the catalyst in real reaction conditions, a
deep understanding of the reaction mechanism is crucial. The mecha-
nism varies with catalyst composition and properties, but most catalysts
follow  a  bi-functional  pathway.  CH4  and  CO2  are  activated  on  two
different  sites  and  the  reaction  between  the  intermediates  formed  is
taking place at the metal–support interface. Generally, the mechanism
can be described in four steps (Figure 4).

The  first  step  of  the  reaction  is  the  adsorption  of  the  reactants.
Methane adsorption is agreed to occur dissociatively on the metal sur-
face. This step is usually the rate limiting step due to the fact that the
CH3-H(g) bond dissociation is very difficult, with an energy of 439.3 kJ

(cid:0) 1. Methane dissociates step-wise, from CH4 to CH3, CH3 to CH2, CH2
mol
to CH and finally, CH to C and H [29]. CO2 however, is able to adsorb on
the support, the metal surface and on the metal-support interface [30].
Nevertheless, in most cases, carbon dioxide adsorbs on the support or at
the  interface  with  the  metal.  CO2  may  dissociate  directly  to  CO  and
adsorbed oxygen or form carbonate precursors [31,32]. The formation
of  carbonates  is  favoured  on  basic  sites  and  monodentate,  bidentate,
bridged carbonates or carboxylates may be formed. Alternatively, CO2
activation  was  found  to  be  enhanced  by  adsorbed  hydrogen  forming
carbonyls through a H-assisted CO2 activation and dissociation process
[33]. Numerous reactions may occur between all the adsorbed species.
Adsorbed hydrogen can spillover to the support and react with adsorbed
oxygen species forming hydroxyl groups whereas adsorbed oxygen may
migrate to the metal surface and oxidise CHx  fragments forming CHxO
species. The presence of water on the surface may favour as well the
formation of CHxO species [34]. The CHxO species then dissociates to
form CO and H2 in a fast step [32].

Depending on the catalyst composition and properties, the reaction
mechanism may go through carbonate or formate intermediates, hence
there is no specific reaction mechanism agreed on for DRM.

Experiments at lab-scale and the determination of intrinsic reaction
rates are essential to formulate the intrinsic kinetic models of the cata-
lyst. Such knowledge on the rate determining steps and kinetic trends
allow  for  the  optimisation  of  the  catalyst  design.  Depending  on  the
nickel-based catalyst formulation, the activation energies for DRM can
(cid:0) 1 where the highest values are obtained for
vary from 26 to 243 kJ mol
CH4  decomposition  and,  H2  and  CO  production.  This  means  that  the
initial activation of methane alone does not determine the rate for most
of the catalysts [33]. Three kinetic models are typically used for DRM:
the Power-law, Eley–Rideal (ER) and Langmuir Hinshelwood–Hougen
Watson (LHHW) models. The power-law model is the simplest approach
and provides a rough estimation of the parameters required since it does
not  consider the  reaction  mechanism.  For  a  majority of  catalysts, the
power constant for methane partial pressure is close to unity (Table 1),
indicating  that  more  methane  is  adsorbed  on  the  species  thus  domi-
nating  the  reaction.  On  the  other  hand,  the  power  constant  for  CO2
partial pressure is generally much lower.

In the ER model, only one reactant is assumed to be associatively
adsorbed on the catalyst surface, at adsorption equilibrium. The adsor-
bed specie then reacts with the other reactant in the gas phase leading
directly to the products. The later step is considered the slow and rate-
determining step (RDS). As both reactants can theoretically adsorb on
the surface, two models can be considered, where gaseous CO2  reacts
with  adsorbed  CH4  (ER1)  or  gaseous  CH4  reacts  with  adsorbed  CO2
(ER2) [35]. This model is not much used for DRM over Ni-based cata-
lysts, whereas the LHHW model is heavily used to construct accurate
kinetic models. In the LHHW model, both reactants are firstly adsorbed
on the catalyst surface before reacting together and form the products. It
is assumed that one reaction step is slow and rate determining while the
others are in thermodynamic equilibrium. The RDS is usually the reac-
tion of an adsorbed specie on the surface to the form the final product.
Because the reaction mechanism depends on the catalyst nature, various
RDS have been considered, often being CH4 dissociation and the surface
reaction of CHx and O. However, many studies reported the formation of
CHxO  species  as  the  Most  Abundant  Reaction  Intermediates  (MARI),
concluding  that  CHxO  decomposition  is  the  kinetically  relevant  step.
Other studies introduced 2-step kinetic models, where two different rate
determining  steps  control  the  reaction  rate.  In  particular,  during  the
formation of carbonate on slightly basic sites, both C-H activation and
CO2  dissociation  are  involved  in  the  rate  determining  steps  [33].  A
sample of rate expressions for Ni based catalysts are shown in Table 1,
using various mechanistic models and RDS.

5. Deactivation causes

5.1. Sintering

In  order  to  enhance  the  performance  of  a  catalyst,  the  surface  of
active  sites  needs  to  be  maximised.  The  dispersion  of  small  metal
nanoparticles  is  relevant  to  many  heterogeneous  catalysts  for  various
applications. However, nanoparticles are not thermally stable and suffer
from sintering leading to loss of activity. As temperature increases, solid-
state  diffusion  becomes  faster.  Empirically,  the  Hüttig  and  Tammann
temperatures, defined as 0.3 and 0.5 times the melting temperature of
the metal, indicate the threshold temperatures where atoms at defects
and atoms from the bulk become mobile, respectively [44].

The growth mechanism of supported crystals is very complex and not
yet fully understood. The rate of growth seems to be dependent on the
wetting  of  the  metal  on  the  support  as  well  as  the  size  of  the  pores.
Overall,  two  mechanisms  have  been  proposed  for  the  sintering  of
nanoparticles. The particle migration and coalescence mechanism sug-
gests that particles move on the surface of the support in a Brownian-like
motion and upon collision, coalesce into larger particles. This mecha-
nism mostly applies to the sintering of small nanoparticles. On the other
hand,  the  Ostwald  ripening  mechanism  implies  the  interparticle
migration of adatoms to form larger particles through the minimisation
of free energy. In this sense, larger particles tend to grow rather than
smaller particles due to differences in surface energy. Hence the mech-
anism of particle growth varies with the particle size distribution but
also with the location of the particle on the support. On supported cat-
alysts, particles may be trapped in the smallest pores thus retarding the
coarsening process, similarly a “valley” position is more stable than an
“on-top”  position.  Increased  wetting  also  reduces  the  migration-
coalescence mechanism although most metal-ceramic substrate combi-
nations are poorly wetting systems [45].

The particles growth kinetics can help determining the mechanism of
sintering. According to Hansen et al. the change in average particle size
over time can be divided in three sections as shown in Figure 5. First the

nanoparticles  experience  a  rapid  loss  in  surface  area,  then  sintering
slows down and finally reaches a relatively stable state. They found by
using  Monte  Carlo  simulations  and  employing  Environmental  Trans-
mission  Electron  Microscopy  (ETEM)  that  Ostwald  ripening  actually
occurs at the first stage, causing the smallest particles to disappear [46].
This result can appear surprising since small particles (under 3 nm) are
very mobile while larger particles (over 10 nm) are most likely immo-
bile,  thus  suggesting  the  migration  coalescence  mechanism  [47].  The
sintering then slows down when the smallest particles have disappeared
and a combination of both mechanisms occur. At the more stable state,
particles are large and other phenomenon like support restructuring may
occur [48].

As  a  result,  recent  insights  using  new  high-resolution  techniques
showed that Oswald ripening is the dominant process involved in metal
nanoparticle sintering, which is more difficult to control through cata-
lyst design than atom migration.

5.2. Coking

Another major cause of deactivation of catalysts under DRM condi-
tions is the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits. Sintering and carbon
deposition  are  closely  intertwined  in  the  deactivation  of  the  catalyst
since carbon growth seems to occur preferentially on larger particles. It
was demonstrated that two catalysts with the same support and same
activity with particle sizes of 7 and 102 nm showed very different rates
of carbon formation. The initial temperature of carbon formation was
higher for the smaller Ni crystallites and the rate much lower. Step sites
are considerably more reactive than close-packed facets for the nucle-
ation of graphite hence if the facets or step edges are too small, nucle-
ation cannot proceed. This explains why very small particles do not grow
graphite  [50,51].  Most  studies  have  estimated  the  critical  size  for  Ni
particles to 6-7 nm, using DFT calculations, thermodynamic analysis and
experimental data but some suggest particle diameters as low as 2 nm
[50,52–54].

The  deposition  of  carbon  is  favourable  in  the  DRM  temperature

range,  mostly  because  of  methane  decomposition  as  explained  previ-
ously.  The  dissociation  of  methane  on  Ni  leads  to  adsorbed  carbon,
which in the absence of hydroxyl groups or adsorbed oxygen, can cover
the  particle  or  diffuse  in  the  subsurface  of  the  metal  lattice  towards
carbon growth centres at the boundary with the support. Various types
of carbon can be form, varying from their structure to their nature, but
they  are  more  commonly  referred  as  coke  or  carbonaceous  species.
Altogether, the net accumulation of carbonaceous deposits is related to
the  difference  between  the  deposition  and  removal  reactions  rates.
Initially,  amorphous  and  graphitic  carbon  islands  form  which  after
accumulation  encapsulate  the  metal  particles.  At  high  temperatures,
single graphene planes may form and grow out from the particle forming
a nanotube between the particle and the support. At lower temperatures,
the energy is too low for the process to happen and a carbon whisker is
formed [50]. The formation of bulk metal carbides is unlikely, but sur-
face carbides can be formed. Carbon migration from the decomposition
sites  to  the  precipitation  sites  occurs  through  surface  or  subsurface
diffusion mostly due to lower energy barrier in comparison to a bulk
diffusion pathway [55,56]. The growth of graphene can occur with a
front growth on Ni facet sites. Carbon adsorbed on the Ni(111) terraces
along the graphene perimeter are incorporated in the graphene layer.
Incorporation  of  carbon  into  the  graphene  sheet  may  also  occur  at
perimeter sites bonded to the nickel step edge in a base-growth scenario
by C incorporation. The base growth can also occur through atom ex-
change with Ni. Carbon diffuses to the step edge site, located below the
graphene layer, and moves up into the graphene layer while sending the
nickel step edge atom to an upper terrace [57]. The C binding energy to
the Ni step site is larger than the energy cost for step formation hence
carbon layers help the formation of Ni step sites, releasing Ni adatoms
that can diffuse to terraces [50,51]. In other words, the growth of gra-
phene layers involves the reshaping and restructuring of nickel particles.
In  particular,  HRTEM  images  evidenced  that  carbon  fibres  have  the
same  diameter  as  the  Ni  cluster  and  that  the  shape  of  the  cluster  is
modified  by  the  carbon  deposit.  Smaller  particles  are  distorted  to  an
elongated shape in the direction of the axis of the nanotube while larger
particles tend to have a pear shape with inclined whiskers nanofibers as
shown in Figure 6 [51,58].

Many nickel-based catalysts suffer from the formation of filamentous
carbon which allow the catalyst to remain active as long as the particle is
not fully covered. Eventually the accumulation of carbon leads to a drop
in the activity, an increase in pressure and reactor blockage. Carbona-
ceous species can be divided in categories based on their hydrogenation
or oxidation temperatures. Carbidic or adsorbed carbon C⍺  can be hy-

sulphur oxides at high temperatures thanks to its high oxygen mobility
enabling the oxygen anions to interact with sulphur on the active metal
sites [66].

Thermodynamically, in reducing environment, Ce2O3  has a higher
sulfidation equilibrium constant than does CeO2 [67]. This results in the
formation  of  either  cerium  oxysulfide  (partial  sulfidation)  or  cerium
sesquisulfide  (complete  sulfidation).  In  the  600-850

actions  conditions  [60].  As  a  result,  catalyst  design  strongly  affects
carbon poisoning. Strategies to minimise catalysts malfunctioning due
to carbon poisoning will be presented later in this review.

5.3. Poisoning

Poisoning is the strong chemisorption of reactants, products, or im-
purities on catalytically active sites thus reducing their role in the cat-
alytic reaction.

• Sulphur

C at extremely low H2S partial pressure (H2S/H2 = 1.6 10

In the case of reforming catalysts and especially nickel-based cata-
lysts,  sulphur  is  the  most  severe  poison.  Sulphur  is  present  in  every
feedstock  whether  in  biogas  or  fossil  fuels  under  the  form  of  H2S  or
organic sulphur compounds (mercaptans, thiophenes). Although desul-
furization is often applied, ppms of sulphur compounds always remain.
In  the  reforming  temperature  range,  all  sulphur  compounds  will  be
converted  to  hydrogen  sulphide.  H2S  chemisorbs  dissociatively  on
nickel, forming Ni-S bonds presumably stronger than the Ni-Ni bonds in
the rest of the particle [61]. The chemisorption results in the formation
of a two-dimensional sulphide layer that blocks the surface for the re-
action.  For  nickel,  a  moderate  sulphur  coverage  of  0.5  is  obtained  at
(cid:0) l2) which
500
means  that  sulphur  in  the  feed  will  be  quantitatively  withheld  until
saturation. Nickel, in particular, is more sensitive to sulphide formation
than  other  Group-8  metals,  having  a  more  favourable  chemical  equi-
librium  of  sulfidation  [62].  However,  sulphur  poising  is  a  reversible
process and regeneration of the catalyst is possible by mild reduction;
high temperature oxidation or high temperature steaming [63,64]. The
regeneration method depends on the catalyst as it may alter the catalyst
structure and oxidation state. An oxidative high temperature treatment
allows  to  remove  sulphur  species  as  SO2,  however  this  causes  the
oxidation  of  the  active  phase  and  the  potential  restructuration  of  the
catalyst.  For  example,  an  air  treatment  at  700
C  did  not  allow  to
regenerate a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst due to the formation of inactive NiAl2O4
◦
[64]. Steaming at temperature above 650
C easily removes all sulphur
species  but  completely  oxidises  Ni  to  NiO.  The  presence  of  promoter
such as K and Na may however prevent full recovery by forming alkali
sulphate  [63].  Reducing  atmosphere  regeneration  removes  the  oxida-
tion drawback and is particularly relevant for transition metal carbide
catalyst [65].

◦

Catalyst  poisoning  by  sulphur  may  also  be  slowed  down  through
catalyst  design.  Some  promoters  were  found  to  improve  the  sulphur
resistance  of  a  catalyst.  Ceria  for  example,  favours  the  formation  of

Following  this  reaction  pathway,  ceria  plays  a  sacrificial  role
allowing the active metal to remain active longer. Oxygen vacancies are
created after reduction of CeO2 to Ce2O3, and sulfidation occurs rapidly
to fill in the voids left by the oxygen [68]. In this case, ceria acts like a
sulphur sorbent.

In reaction conditions, S adatom are oxidised by CO2  but are then
consumed to refill the oxygen vacancies of CeO2. This repeated oxida-
tion/reduction cycle accelerates the re-oxidation of surface CeO2  lead-
ing to fewer oxygen vacancies and more reactive oxygen on the surface
potentially promoting DRM [69]. The slow formation of Ce2O2S through
the diffusion of O vacancies and S ions into the bulk, however, causes
catalyst deactivation [70]. Lanthana plays a similar role by reacting with
sulphur in the feed to form La2O2S, but lacks the properties of ceria for
active in situ oxidation of sulphur deposits [71].

Alkali and alkaline earth elements have shown to effectively increase
the  sulphur  resistance  of  a  catalyst,  at  low  loadings.  Sulphur  ligands
withdraw electron density from the poisoned metals, and since alkaline
elements are highly electropositive, they can donate electrons to sulphur
ligands blocking the interaction between sulphur species and the active
metal [72]. Potassium is known decorate the active sites in reforming
and  decrease  the  activity  while  preventing  coking.  However,  it  was
found to also lower the surface S coverage of active Ni sites due to a
weakening of the Ni-S bond [73,74]. Barium oxide is able to react with
sulphur compounds before they reach the active metal sites to prevent
catalyst poisoning. The presence of BaO generates Ba-S instead of the
formation of nickel sulphides thus preventing sulphur coverage on Ni
surface. In addition, BaO has a high affinity for water which could favour
the in situ regeneration of the oxide, through the reaction of BaS and
nearby  adsorbed  OH  species.  The  barium  component  may  however
deactivate through the formation of stable barium carbonates [75].

Since noble metals are more resistant to sulphur poisoning than Ni,
bimetallic systems and alloys involving noble metals are also envisaged
[76,77]. DFT calculations clearly show that binary alloys with transition
and noble metal such as Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au reduce the dissoci-
ation of H2S which becomes thermodynamically unfavourable. Substi-
tution  of  Ni  by  one  of  these  metals  on  the  surface  weakened  the
adsorption  strength  of  H2S,  HS,  H,  and  S  by  decreasing  the  d-band
centre. The weak binding energy between the products (HS + H) and the
surface makes H2S dissociation unfavourable. The interactions between
sulphur  atoms  resulting  from  H2S  dissociation  and  the  surface,  are
weakened by the dopant metals at the topmost layer. On the other hand,
the H-S bond within H2S is fortified, decreasing the activation energy for
H2S [78]. Gold in particular seems to have a greater effect. Since Ni and
Au do not mix in the bulk, they form stable alloy-like structures in the
outermost layer where Au tends to segregate at the step sites and acts as

a site blocker [62]. The Au-Ni alloyed surface inhibits the formation of
strongly  bonded  sulphur  compounds,  such  as  Ni  sulphide  [79].  Sn  is
another  well-known  site  blocker  and  enhances greatly  the  coke resis-
tance of Ni catalysts. Sn was also found to impact the sulphur resistance
by affecting the sulphur adsorption energies. In particular in SOFC, Sn
adatoms on the Ni atoms can form a physical barrier to prevent sulphur
diffusion  to  the  O  vacancy  in  the  support  due  to  the  large  diffusion
barriers [80,81].

The addition of Mo on the other hand improves sulphur tolerance
through a sacrificial process. In the presence of Ni, Mo tends to form
molybdenum sulphide due to a significant enhancement in the Mo to S
interactions. The Ni-Mo and Ni-S-Mo interactions increase the electron
density on Mo, making Mo more chemically active in the adsorption of
S-containing molecules and the dissociation of H2 [82,83]. Many other
strategies are under investigation and reported elsewhere [72,84,85].

• Biogas impurities

With the emergence of a biogas economy, new poisons need to be
considered. Biogas, especially produced from landfill, is often contam-
inated by siloxanes. Siloxanes are volatile organic silicon compounds of
general formula [SiO(CH3)2]n or [SiO(C6H5)2]n. In contact with oxygen
at high temperature, siloxanes combust to SiO2  which agglomerates in
the reactor, thus damaging the equipment and lowering the energy re-
covery. Siloxane removal technologies have been developed and consist
of absorbents (activated carbon, silica gel, zeolites) or silicone-rubber
membranes.  Several  studies  have  been  conducted  on  siloxane
poisoning in gas turbines, gas engines and gas sensors, but very few were
conducted on the poisoning of catalyst [86]. The impact of 10 ppm of
siloxane D5 and up to 20 ppm of D4 on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)
activity  was  studied  above  750
C  in  humidified  H2  and  simulated
biogas. High deactivation of the cell performance was observed due to
the precipitation of large amount of SiO2 on the surface of the Ni-based
anode while a smaller amount was also located within the porous anode
layer, down to the electrolyte layer [87–89]. This may cause a decrease
in the active triple phase boundary regions, leading to an increase in
non-ohmic anodic polarisation and in ohmic loss on the anode side [90,
91]. This poisoning is irreversible and even ppb of siloxane will damage
the performance of the fuel cell. In fuel cell conditions, D5 decomposed
following the reactions:

This  decomposition  is  likely  to  occur  in  reforming  conditions,
involving pore blockage. Elsayed et al. studied the poisoning effects of
SiO2  deposits  during  biogas  dry  reforming  on  a  Ni-Mg/CeO2-ZrO2
catalyst.  Increasing  amounts  of  SiO2  led  to  greater  deactivation,
affecting both CO2 and CH4 conversions [92]. While the impregnation of
TEOS  on  a  Rh/αAl2O3  did  not  affect  the  activity,  possibly  due  to  the
formation  of  Si(OH)4  with  steam  at  high  temperature  [93].  However
direct siloxane decomposition during biogas reforming was studied by
Setiawan et al. At low concentration (under 3 ppm), the deactivation of
the Ru-based catalyst was very slow but a test with 100 ppm of siloxane
indicated  that  silica  covered  the  active  sites  [94].  The  formation  of
amorphous SiO2 was also observed in a deoxygenation of biogas process
on Pt/γ Al2O3 where D4 siloxane reacted with O2 on the surface of the
catalyst, blocking the active sites of the catalyst resulting in the catalyst
deactivation [95]. There is no solution proposed to this day to remove or
prevent  SiO2  deposition  on  reforming  catalyst.  Complete  removal  of
siloxanes is therefore mandatory prior the reformer or SOFC.

Biogas  also  contains  traces  of  chlorine,  ammonia  and  aromatics
(benzene and toluene), which may affect the reforming catalyst [10].
Chlorocarbons  are  derived  from  chlorinated  compounds  in  organic
materials and can poison reforming catalysts. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl)
reacts with alumina to produce surface chlorine. Indeed, alumina con-
tains a mixture of Lewis acid, Br ̈onsted acid, and basic sites on which HCl
can dissociate and form Al-Cl and H2O. In particular hydroxyl groups are
replaced following the reaction:

Al (cid:0)

(cid:0) OH + HCl

↼
⇁

Al (cid:0)

(cid:0) Cl + H2O

(17)

The replacement of a hydroxyl group, which in most configurations
is basic, increases the acidity of the alumina. Additionally, the Br ̈onsted
acidity of the alumina is increased due to weak OH bonds, resulting from
the polarisation of the lattice of hydroxyl groups by chloride [96]. Since
hydroxyl  group  have  been  replaced,  the  formation  of  formate  is
impacted thus affecting the occurrence of the forward and reverse WGS
reactions (eq. 7). The effect of 10-50 ppm of CH3Cl was investigated on a
Rh/γ-Al2O3  catalyst  for  DRM.  The  degree  of  chlorine  poisoning
increased with increasing CH3Cl concentration and decreasing temper-
ature since chlorination of alumina is less thermodynamically favoured
at high temperatures. The H2/CO ratio was visibly altered due to the
poisoning of RWGS. However, this effect is reversible by discontinuing
methyl chloride or co-feeding water [97]. In a SOFC setting, HCl caused
a  loss  of  activity  during  internal  reforming  of  biogas  on  Ni-YSZ  and

W-Ni-CeO2 anode. Results suggested that chlorine was present in form of
adsorbed  species  on  the  nickel  and  cerium  particles  rather  than  as
NiCl2(g). This occupation of the active sites was deemed responsible for
the loss in activity, preventing the C-H bond activation [98–100]. On the
other hand, the presence of ammonia did not deactivate the catalyst but
improved  the  performance  of  the  SOFC  through  the  reduction  of
ammonia to hydrogen and nitrogen. It is believed the H2 produced can
reduce the coke formation, as confirmed by thermodynamic calculations
[101]. In biogas reforming, Yin et al. noticed a slight deactivation of the
Ni-Rh/MgAl2O4  catalyst  due  to  ammonia.  Although  ammonia  should

C, this was not observed under their re-
decompose on Ni above 700
action conditions and deactivation was attributed to the covering of the
active sites by NH2* [102].

6. Catalysts for DRM

Carbon dioxide is a very stable molecule, almost chemically inert,
(cid:0) 1. As a result, the activation of
with a Gibbs free energy of -394 kJ mol
CO2  is particularly difficult and requires high energy supply and very
active  metal  catalysts.  In  addition,  in  order  to  achieve  complete  con-
versions, the reaction needs to take place at high temperatures. How-
ever,  under  such  conditions,  metal  supported  catalysts  are  prone  to
sintering of the metallic phase. Moreover, carbon deposition induced by
methane  decomposition  is  also  favoured  as  previously  descibed.
Therefore, DRM catalysts are not only required to be highly active, but
also selective and highly stable. The performance of a catalyst is affected
by the nature and particle size of the metal, the structure, texture and
nature of the support and by the reaction conditions.

6.1. Conventional catalysts

Conventional catalysts for reforming reactions are composed of more
than a single component in order to tailor highly active, selective and
stable  catalysts.  A  metallic  active  phase  is  typically  deposited  on  a
support material forming a supported metal catalyst. The support ma-
terials are typically inactive on their own but play a major role in the
performance of the catalysts. The textural properties of the support can
maximise the dispersion of the metallic phase by offering large surface
area. Their geometry can also be adapted to suit specific reactor design,
minimising pressure drop and maximizing heat transfer. The chemical
properties of the support are of acute importance and take part in the
reaction  mechanism  (bi-functional  mechanism)  through  their  redox,
acid/base  and  structural  properties.  In  particular,  the  metal-support
interactions cause an electronic influence that strongly affects the sta-
bility of the catalyst as well as the reaction mechanism.

• Noble metal catalysts

◦

Noble metals are extremely performant for reforming reactions. They
are able to function at much higher space velocities and exhibit greater
carbon  resistance  than  transition  metals.  They  benefit  from  lower
equilibrium  constants  for  methane cracking  and  carbon cannot  easily
dissolve  in  their  lattices  [30].  When  supported  on  a  MgAl2O4  spinel
support and compared, the activity of noble metals at 650
C ranges: Ru
> Rh, Ni > Ir > Pt > Pd. However the quantification of coke deposition
on the catalysts follows a different order: Ni > Pd >>Ir > Pt > Ru, Rh
[103].  Rhodium  and  Ruthenium  based  catalysts  are  the  most  active
metals for DRM while presenting negligible amount of carbon retention.
Moreover, the stability of noble metal catalysts can be further boosted by
the modification of the support. Although reducible oxides like CeO2,
TiO2, ZrO2  or Nb2O5  tend to perform poorly as support, showing very
long  activation  periods,  irreducible  oxides  such  as  La2O3,  MgO  and
γ-Al2O3  displayed  improved  performance  [104].  Various  strategies
aiming at  improving the  coke resistance of catalysts  and increase the
dispersion of metals exists and the techniques summarised in the next
section are also applied to noble metals.

• Nickel catalysts

Although noble metals are highly active and quite robust to carbon
deposition,  their  price  and  limited  availability  is  driving  research  to-
wards  the  use  of  more  affordable  transition  metals.  Ni  especially  has
been found to reach high conversions however it suffers severely from
carbon deposition [105]. Since methane dissociative adsorption on the
metal is generally considered as the rate-limiting step, focus is set on
metal  dispersion  and  stability  towards  sintering.  The  sintering  of  Ni
results  in  the  loss  of  surface  area  i.e.  active  sites  and  hence  activity.
Additionally, carbon growth is closely related to particle size as it hap-
pens preferably on large clusters [30]. Nickel dispersion is therefore of
paramount importance for the stability of the catalyst. Nickel dispersion
may be affected by the textural properties of the support but this cannot
be linearly related to the catalytic performance since various phenom-
ena are induced by metal-support interactions [106].

Multiple  strategies  were  put  in  place  to  avoid  sintering  of  nickel
particles and the consequent carbon formation. Indeed the performance
of  nickel  catalysts  was  successfully  improved  by  implementing  few
major concepts. The addition of promoters to the formulation can affect
the electronic interactions between the various components. Promoters
may  affect  the  redox  properties  of  the  catalyst,  the  dispersion  of  the
particles  and  the  oxygen  mobility  if  applied  to  the  support.  The
morphology of the support may be controlled to satisfy large and porous
surface  area.  The  acid/base  features  of  the  support  may  be  tuned  to
improve  CO2  activation  or  modify  the  metal-support  interactions.
Bimetallic formulations often yield to better performance by associating
the  properties  of  different  metals  or  creating  a  synergic  effect  and
sulphur passivation is also a known approach to prevent carbon growth
by selectively sacrificing large particles. However, even upon applying
these  strategies  nickel  catalysts  still  show  inevitably  signs  of
deactivation.

The state-of-the-art catalyst for dry reforming is based on γ -alumina,
which benefits from high surface area, high thermal stability, low cost
and has the capacity to highly disperse nickel. Nevertheless alumina is
prone to form a NiAl2O4  spinel with nickel at high temperature which
can subsequently affect the catalytic performance of the catalyst [107].
In addition, the acid-basic properties of alumina are not favourable to
CO2  adsorption.  In  fact,  CO2  possesses  two  reaction  sites:  the  carbon
atom which is an electrophilic centre, mildly acidic according to Lewis,
and the oxygen atom which is a nucleophilic centre, weakly basic ac-
cording to Lewis [31]. Hence to improve CO2  adsorption, the catalyst
needs to activate both acid and basic centres.

In order to facilitate CO2  adsorption on acidic alumina, the incor-
poration of basic sites was proposed by adding reducible and basic metal
oxides to the support. These metal oxides affect the reaction mechanism
in  several  manner,  they  enhance  CO2  activation  and  provide  surface
oxygen species and hydroxyl species that effectively help carbon gasi-
fication to CO. Basic metal oxides including La2O3, MgO, CaO and CeO2
were  added  to  γ  -alumina  and  impregnated  with  nickel  by  Charisiou
et al. [108–110]. All promoted supports enhanced the catalytic activity
and stability of the standard Ni/Al2O3, CeO2 in particular is increasingly
reported in heterogeneous catalysis due to its high oxygen storage ca-
pacity  (OSC)  [111].  The  oxygen  vacancies  induced  by  ceria  redox
mechanism enhance CO2  adsorption [112]. The addition of dopants in
CeO2 lattice or solid solutions based on Ce have been studied to increase
to amount of defect oxygen formed [113]. La2O3  positively affects the
performance of the catalyst due to two effects. First the basicity of La2O3
promotes  CO2  activation,  and  leads  to  the  formation  of  lanthanum
oxycarbonate.  The  latter  enhance  CO2  decomposition  to  CO  and  O,
increasing the rate of gasification of carbon. Second, the formation of
NiLa2O4  spinel  may  hinder  sintering  and  hence  coking  [114].  The
addition of alkali and alkali earth metals was also found to inhibit car-
bon formation due to the increased number of surface basic sites. CaO
promotion in particular, increased the reaction rate of the catalyst due to
the  enhanced  formation  of  formates  and  improved  the  stability  [39,

115]. MgO as a promoter has been extensively used for reforming re-
actions, in industrial applications [14]. More specifically the formation
of MgAl2O4 spinel has shown to limit Ni sintering and carbon deposition
relatively  to  the  NiO-MgO  solid  solution  [72].  Finally,  K2O  was  also
found  to  mitigate  carbon  deposition  by  increasing  the  rate  of  carbon
gasification. However the high mobility of K and its interaction with Ni
give rise to large NiO ensembles thus negatively affecting the activity
[72].

• Bimetallic formulations

In addition, bimetallic combinations i.e. Ni-Rh, Ni-Ru, Ni-Co, Ni-Sn
or Ni-Pt have been studied, showing in some cases very promising re-
sults. Indeed, the advanced behaviour displayed by bimetallic systems is
ascribed to multiple effects such as (i) a boost on active sites concen-
tration (cooperative effect) (ii) electronic effect arising from metal-metal
contact leading to enhanced tolerance towards carbon deposition (iii)
the sacrificial role played by one of the elements within the bimetallic
ensemble,  allowing  the  second  metal  to  remain  available  and  un-
poisoned  [72].  Among  the  bimetallic  combinations,  avoiding  noble
metals  is  the  logical  choice  for  costing  reasons.  Herein,  Ni-Sn  is  a
promising choice for reforming processes. Belonging to the same group
of the periodic table, Sn and C share the valance band structure with p
electrons close to a stable s-orbital. Ni carbon poisoning takes place via
the 3d-orbitals of Ni interacting with the 2p orbitals of carbon resulting
in nickel carbide which eventually triggers the solid carbon formation
[116]. Introducing Sn in the formulation favours the interaction of Sn
p-orbitals  with  Ni  3d  levels  thus  hampering  the  development  of  the
nickel  carbide  as  coke  initiator  [116].  Nevertheless,  Sn  can  also
compromise the catalytic activity when large amount of this element is
introduced  in  the  catalytic  formulation  [117].
Indeed,  Sn  could
potentially cover Ni active sites thus making difficult reactants activa-
tion. On the other hand, promotion of Ni with low amount of precious
metals –  always within the economically acceptable range –  has been
proven advantageous. Herein, a low-cost Ni based system could benefit
from the excellent activity and superior carbon deposition properties of
the noble metal. Ni-Pt is an example of a successful combination with
catalysts  displaying  promising  activity  and  stability  levels  with
remarkably low Pt loadings (i.e. 0.3 wt.%). Briefly, the addition of Pt
facilitates NiO reduction – thus increasing the concentration of actives
sites – while helping to improve Ni dispersion. As a result, the bimetallic
catalysts possess higher concentration of active sites with smaller and
well-dispersed Ni nanoparticles [118,119]. Kinetic studies using power
law models found that when the Ni/Pt ratio was 75/1, the order in CO2
was 1.4 whereas a Ni/Pt ratio of 33/1 results in an order of 0.87. This
entails that Pt enhances the reactivity of oxygen dissociated from CO2
which  then  reacts  with  adsorbed  carbon.  Thus  the  promotion  of  Ni
catalysts by Pt improves dispersion but also the stability with enhanced
coke resistance [118,120].

Ni-Rh bimetallic systems may result in the formation of surface Ni-Rh
alloy,  depending  on  the  synthesis  method.  The  presence  of  Rh  on  Ni
surfaces increases the energy barriers of carbon diffusion and C-C bond
formation. Adsorbed carbon on Ni(111) is more easily dissolved into the
sublayer  to form a stable nickel carbide, whereas Rh alloyed Ni(111)
inhibits this process by decreasing the driving force and slowing down
the reaction rate. Nevertheless, O diffusion and C-O formation are not
especially affected thus resulting in carbon deposition mitigation [121].
Small amounts of Rh also increase the reducibility and dispersion of Ni
resulting in highly active and stable catalysts [122].

In the case of transition metals, cobalt has shown the best perfor-
mance. Zhang et al. ranked the activity of bimetallic catalysts based on
AlMgOx  as Ni-Co > Ni-Mn > Ni-Fe > Ni-Cu. The superior activity and
coke resistance observed with Co was attributed to the synergetic effect,
high metallic surface and good dispersion. More specifically, low con-
tent of Co led to less carbon formation and equal activity [123]. Cobalt
has  a  strong  affinity  with  oxygen  species  which  eventually  can  cause

poisoning  by  surface  oxygen.  Indeed,  monometallic  Co  catalysts  de-
activates in DRM due to oxidation [8].

During pulse injection of CO2 on Co/γ-Al2O3, a portion of metallic Co
is oxidised to CoO which in turns is reduced again in a dynamic redox
process  by  adsorbed  carbon  originating  from  the  dissociation  of
methane. The Cobalt loading is therefore crucial to balance the gener-
ation of carbon species and its oxidative removal [124]. In a bimetallic
configuration with Ni, the presence of Co enhances the adsorption of
CO2 due to the strong Co-O interaction while Ni helps to prevent Co from
oxidising. DFT simulations show that on NiCo clusters, CH4 dissociation
occurs via an oxygen adatom forming adsorbed CH3 and OH thanks to
the abundance of oxygen atoms on the surface originating from the high
oxophilicity of Co [125].

While  Fe  is  inactive  for  DRM,  Ni-Fe  bimetallic  formulations  often
result  in  the  formation  of  an  alloy  which  is  the  active  phase  in  DRM
◦
[126]. Reduced above 700
C, Fe2O3 and NiO form a Ni-Fe alloy which is
◦
stable upon oxidation with CO2 up to 700
C but decomposes to Ni and
Fe3O4  at  higher  temperatures.  The  DRM  reaction  follows  a  Mars–van
Krevelen mechanism on Fe-Ni/MgAl2O4  catalysts, where CO2  oxidises
Fe to FeOx and CH4 is activated on Ni sites to form H2 and surface car-
bon. Lattice oxygen from FeOx  then oxidise the adsorbed carbon, pro-
ducing CO. Hence the presence of iron helps coke mitigation through a
redox  process  [127].  Fe  in  NiFe  alloys  is  partially  oxidised  to  FeO,
leading to a partial dealloying and the formation of a Ni-richer alloy. The
presence and migration of FeO towards the surface allows its reaction
with carbon deposits, whereby the reduced Fe restores the original Ni-Fe
alloy [128]. The location of Fe plays a key role in carbon mitigation. The
incorporation of Fe in the support, forming MgFexAl2–xO4, increases the
carbon  resistance  of  the  catalyst  due  to  enhanced  O  mobility.  Upon
reduction, half of Fe remains in the support lattice, maintaining its redox
properties while the rest formed Ni-Fe alloy on the surface [129].

• Interstitial compounds

Alternatively, interstitial compounds like metal carbide, nitride, and
phosphides have received attention as potential catalyst. Molybdenum
carbide for example is very stable for high pressure DRM thanks to an
oxidation-recarburisation  mechanism  but  deactivates  at  atmospheric
pressure due to oxidation [130]. When the reaction of CO2 with carbides
is  more favourable  than  the  reaction  of  CH4  with  oxides,  the  carbide
catalyst inevitably oxidises  to metal  oxides [131]. A Ni/Mo2C system
was  proposed  where  CH4  dissociation  occurred  on  Ni  while  CO2  was
activated  on  the  carbide.  The  metal  to  carbide  ratio  however  is  of
paramount importance to avoid oxidation of the carbide and coking of
the metal [132]. MoP on the other hand was highly active without any
Ni addition. However, the catalyst suffered from oxidation during DRM
in a first step, producing MoO2, which in turn was in-situ carburized by
CH4  to produce Mo2C [130]. Nickel phosphide has promising features
for DRM [133]. According to DFT simulations, the diffusion of C atoms is
greatly  deterred  on  Ni2P  (0001)  compared  to  Ni  (111)  plane  surface
since the activation energy barrier is much higher. Plus, the O coverage
relative to C is much  higher on Ni2P (0001) and increased with tem-
perature,  which  could  further  help  carbon  oxidation  [134].  Experi-
mentally however, Ni2P showed much lower activity than MoP [135].
The promotion effect of phosphor on a Ni catalyst is on the other hand
demonstrated. The modification of alumina by phosphor results in the
formation  of  AlPO4  which  reduces  the  surface  acidity  and  thus  sup-
presses solid carbon deposition at low P loading [136]. On a ceria-based
catalyst, P slightly increases the electron density on Ni atoms and thus
induced  more  oxygen  vacancies  formation  in  CeO2,  inhibiting  coking
during the reforming [137]. Overall the P loading has a crucial impact
on the surface acidity and thus on carbon formation. Both the reforming
activity  and  the  amount of  coke monotonically decreased  as  the  Ni:P
atomic ratio changes from 6 to 2. The presence of P reduced the coke
content 8-fold at an atomic ratio of 4; while when the atomic ratio de-
creases to 2, the coke content reduces 55-fold, with a decline in activity

of only 10%. High loading of P could lead to the formation of NiO as
confirmed by DFT and blockage of the active sites. The optimal P loading
on  a  10  wt%.  Ni/Al2O3  catalyst  was  estimated  at  1.3  wt.%  where  P
makes  the  surface  more  basic  by  reducing  the  density  of  surface  hy-
droxyl  groups  of  alumina  support  which  favours  CO2  adsorption  and
thus promotes coke gasification [138].

• Single atom catalysts

Recently, single atom catalysts (SAC) comprising isolated, individual
metal atoms dispersed on a support, have been successfully synthesised
[139,140]  thus  yielding  catalysts  with  maximum  dispersion.  The
concept of SAC promises 100% atom utilisation and therefore is of great
interest  especially  for  lowering  the  cost  noble  metal  catalysts.  The
chemistry of a single atom however is very different from a nanoparticle
(NP),  first  because  of  its  oxidation  state,  usually  existing  as  a  stable
cation,  and  second  due  to  strong  metal-support  interactions  [141].
Atomically dispersed Pt, Pd and Au catalysts have been tested for CO
oxidation and WGS reactions, supported on oxides of reducible metal
ions such as Ce4+
. In the WGS reaction, single atoms are
believed to be more active than nanoparticles, which act as spectator
when  both  sites  are  presents.  In  comparison  for  CO  oxidation,  single
atoms are not necessarily more active than NP, where the activity to size
relation is more complex and depends on multiple factors [142]. Indeed
the  structures  of  SACs  may  change  during  reaction  processes  and
restructuring phenomena were observed. SAC are dynamic and recent
findings show that NPs may be dispersed to single atoms under certain
conditions [143,144].

and Fe3+

, Ti4+

Very few studies have been conducted on SACs for the reforming of
methane. Single atoms of Rh were formed on a Sm2O3  and CeO2  pro-
moted Al2O3 support. Depending on Sm2O3 promotion, various ratios of
single atom to nanoclusters were obtained. When tested for SRM, the
sample containing the highest amount of single atom showed lowered
rates and stronger deactivation because of coking. Methane activation
on atomically dispersed rhodium species led to the formation of carbon,
which  is  believed  to  oxidise  on  adjacent  nanoparticles.  Hence  the
presence of nanoparticles was deemed necessary to the stability of the
catalyst. On a different note, some single atoms were still visible after
1.5 h of SMR, showing a relative thermal stability [145]. Similar results
were obtained with a Ru/MgAl2O4 SAC. Higher activation energies were
measured under DRM on the catalysts containing the smallest clusters.
After  a  stable  600  h  test,  no  single  atom  was  found  on  the  sample,
exclusively exhibiting nanoparticles of 2.7 nm mean diameter [146].

Akri et al. produced an atomically dispersed nickel on hydroxyapatite
(HAP)  catalyst  by  strong  electrostatic  adsorption.  Tested  for  DRM,  it
strongly  deactivated  through  sintering.  They  demonstrated  that  CeOx
doping  traps  isolated  Ni  atoms,  inducing  strong  metal-support  in-
teractions,  thus  preventing  on-stream  sintering  and  deactivation.  The
Ce-doped catalyst showed high activity and stability for 100 h DRM with
negligible carbon deposition [147]. According to DFT calculations on
CH4  decomposition,  the  first  C–H  bond  cleavage  is  exothermic  by
0.65 eV with an activation barrier of 0.63 eV which is much lower than
that over a Ni(111) surface (0.9 eV). As a result, activation of the first
C–H  bond  in  CH4  is  extremely  efficient  over  ceria-bound  isolated  Ni
atoms. The dissociation of CH3 however, is strongly disfavoured but the
oxidation of CH3 to CH3O was found to offer a plausible pathway for CH3
dehydrogenation to CO [147,148].

As described previously, bimetallic formulations have the potential
to alter the electronic properties of a metal. Isolated bimetallic sites, at a
cationic state, could formulate a different site leading to different sur-
face processes. The close proximity of two metal cations could facilitate
the adsorption and dissociation of reactant molecules and/or accelerate
the formation of an intermediate specie or a product molecule. Addi-
tionally, isolated bimetallic sites do not provide different binding loca-
tions such as terraces, edges and corners or configurations such as linear
or bridged adsorption as opposed to nanoparticles. As a result, binding

configurations are minimized leading to limited dissociated species and
intermediate allowing to select a particular reaction pathway or enhance
a catalyst selectivity [149].

Tang et al. demonstrated the synergetic effect of Ni and Ru in a dual
single-atom  sites  catalyst.  Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2  nanorods  were  syn-
thesised through a hydrothermal method yielding Ni and Ru single atom
sites. Synergistic effect between Ru and Ni in Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2 was
confirmed by its lowest apparent activation barrier and highest turnover
rate of forming CO and H2  compared to the monometallic single atom
catalysts.  The  dissociation  of  methane  occurred  on  Ni  preferentially
while Ru exclusively activated CO2  with an adjacent oxygen vacancy.
DFT calculations led to conclude that first H atoms were generated on Ni
sites  and  then  coupled  on  Ru  sites  to  form  H2  in  a  catalytic  cycle.
Additionally, the oxidation of CH3 to CH3O is likely to be the dominant
pathway in contrast to the dehydrogenation of CH3 into CH2 and H on a
Ni  site.  Indeed  the  catalyst  was  stable  for  66  h  at  low  temperature

formation. Operando characterisations in reaction mixture indicate that
the  particles  are  in  the  atomic  scale  during  reaction.  As  shown  in
Figure 7, XAS experiments suggest that each Ni atom bonds with three
oxygen  atoms  on  average  in  the  first  coordination  shell  whereas  Ru
bonds with four and Ni and Ru both bond with three Ce atoms in the
closest second coordination shell (Ni–O–Ce and Ru-O-Ce). No Ru–O–Ru
nor  Ni–O–Ni  structure  seemed  to  exist,  thus  suggesting  the  single
dispersion  of  cations  in  reaction  conditions.  However  the  stability  of
single atoms in the long term is still to be demonstrated [150].

Overall single atom catalysts are potential coke-free catalysts, how-
ever  their  application  for  highly  endothermic  reactions  like  dry
reforming is dependent on their thermal stability. To this day, the role
and  chemistry  of  single  atoms  during  reaction  are  under  debate.  The
formulation of single atom catalysts often yields in mixtures of atomi-
cally dispersed atoms and clusters thus rending difficult the attribution
of  surface  chemistry  phenomenon.  Indirect  proof  or  lack  of  nano-
particles evidence are often used to justify the presence of single atoms,
however  recent  advances  in  electron  microscopy  techniques  enabling
the  direct  visualization  of  single  atoms  and  advanced  theoretical
modelling will clarify many assumptions, so far postulated.

6.2. Structured approaches

Great  efforts  are  deployed  to  improve  the  sintering  resistance  of
transition metal-based catalysts. Different strategies have been applied,
some aiming to increase the interaction strength between the metal and
the support while others aimed at confining the particles in cavities and
shell or tube-shaped structures. A summary of the described strategies
can be found in Table 2.

• Core/yolk shell

Catalyst design approaches aiming to encapsulate the active metal
phase in inorganic cavities are showing some promising results in pre-
venting sintering of the active sites [151]. Metals or bimetallic nano-
particles encapsulated in oxides with yolk or core shell structures have
demonstrated  promising  results.  The  core/shell  type  catalyst  can  be
engineered  in  various  ways  to  suit  a  specific  application.  The  overall
architecture  of  the  catalyst  constitutes  a  spherical  core  covered  by  a
shell, called a core-shell catalyst, or a free-floating core separated from
the shell by a void called yolk-shell catalyst. The compositions of both
core and shell can be tuned, involving multicomponent. Single core as
well as multicore can be prepared. Similarly, single-shell, multishell or
porous-shell can be designed [152]. In the case of dry reforming, the
encapsulation  of  nickel  nanoparticles  inside  porous  silica  or  alumina
shells has been widely studied and the shells act as microcapsule-like
reactors.

Various  methods  exist  to  prepare  core-shell  catalysts.  The  sol-gel
method  also  called  Stӧber  is  often  applied.  Typically,  the  cores

nanoparticles are synthesised and dispersed in a solvent by means of a
surfactant. The shell is then coated upon the core via hydrolysis cata-
lysed  by  a  base  and  condensation  of  the  shell  precursor,  commonly
tetraethyl  orthosilicate  (TEOS)  in  the  case  of  SiO2  shells.  The  micro-
emulsion  method  which  allows  the  formation  of  homogeneous  and
small core sizes consists in forming the core and the shell in situ within
the micro-emulsion. The micro-emulsion consists in a water, an oil and a
surfactant phase which composition, mixing and pH affect its stability
and  therefore  the  morphology  of  the  produced  core-shells  [153]. Hy-
drothermal methods are also employed, which treatment duration can
affect the thickness of the shells [154].

One of the main limitations of core/yolk-shell catalysts is their low
yields obtained during the synthesis procedure thus making the large-
scale  catalysts  manufacturing  very  challenging.  In  this  regard,  Zhang
et al. reported a simple and potentially scalable synthesis of a Ni@SiO2
core–shell  catalyst  by  growing  a  silica  shell  around  dispersed  NiO
nanoparticle by a sol-gel process. The catalyst was active for DRM but
showed some deactivation due to coke formation. The reduction of the
NiO core particles to Ni created nanocavities between the core and the
shell which allowed for solid carbon to form. The Ni particles produced
were of diameter between 12 and 36 nm [155]. On the other hand, Zhao
et al. described a Ni@SiO2 core-shell catalyst stable for over 1000 hours
◦
at 800
C. They used a microemulsion method and managed to uniformly
encapsulate particles of 5 nm in a 15 nm-thickness SiO2 shell as shown in
Figure 8. The original core shell structure was maintained throughout
the  test,  preventing  Ni  to  sinter  due  to  the  “confinement  effect”.  In
addition,  NiCo@SiO2  core-shell were produced and  outperformed the
activity of the Ni@SiO2 and Co@SiO2 catalysts [156]. Additionally, they
highlighted that the heat treatment of the catalyst had a direct effect on
the stability of the catalyst. Higher heat treatments led to higher SiO2
crystallinity and stronger Si-Ni interactions. Indeed, poor crystallinity of
SiO2  provokes  the  damage  of  the  core shell  structure  during  reaction
leading to Ni particles agglomeration. Although SiO2  shells are mostly
studied because of the maturity of SiO2 nanosphere chemistry, attempts
to encapsulate Ni in other oxides are reported. Tang et al. synthesised
Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalyst with different shell thickness and diameter
using  a  hydrothermal  synthesis  method.  This  synthesis  ranged  a  Ni

average crystallite size of 30 nm. The ceria based catalyst was subjected
to less deactivation than the equivalent silica based catalyst emphasising
that  CeO2  can  provide  more  lattice  oxygen  atoms  and  vacancies  to
mitigate  carbon  deposition  [154].  Overall,  the  core  and  shell  diame-
ters/thickness have a strong influence on the catalytic activity and the
micro-emulsion method yields the smallest particles, however the latest
method is complex and hardly scalable.

Yolk-shell catalysts on the other hand, need to be synthesised using a
template. Different methods are employed: hard-templating, soft-tem-
plating and self-templating. In the hard-templating method, the sacri-
ficial template between the core and the shell is a rigid material, easily
coated on the core and easily removable by calcination or etching, like
carbon, a polymer or a metal oxide. The soft-templating technique uses
vesicles  of  surfactant,  while  the  self-templating  method  relies  on  the
Kirkendall effect and Oswald ripening [153].

Li et al. synthesised Ni@SiO2 yolk-shell catalysts with different shell
thicknesses  by  selective  etching  via  calcination  and  reduction.  When
shell  thickness  exceeded  5.7  nm  a  yolk-satellite-shell  structured  Ni-
yolk@Ni@SiO2  was  formed  meaning  that  Ni  satellite  particles  were
present  around  the  Ni  core,  encapsulated  in  silica.  The  yolk-satellite-
shell  with  11.2  nm  shell  thickness  performed  better  than  the  3.3  nm
thick  shell  Ni@SiO2  yolk-shell  and  no  carbon  was  formed  after  a  90
hours  test  [151].  This  study  confirms  the  close  relationship  between
stability  and  performance  during  DRM  and  shell  thickness.  The
composition of the core and the benefits of the yolk-shell morphology
was highlighted by Zhao et al. Bimetallic NiCe@m-SiO2 were prepared
and exhibited greater stability for DRM than unencapsulated catalysts
due the confinement effect. The CeO2 was successfully incorporated into
the shells and acted as a key factor in improving the catalytic perfor-
mance  and  suppressing  the  carbon  deposition  [157].  Lu  et  al.  used  a
different  strategy  and  created  yolk  shell  catalysts  where  the  nickel
particles  were  dispersed  on  the  inner  side  of  the  hollow  silica sphere
(HSS). The Ni@HSS catalyst maintained a particle size of 8 nm after a 55
hour test. Strong interactions between Ni and silica were formed and the
one pot synthesis method used contributed to the great performance of
the catalyst [158].

Overall, the core-shell/yolk-shell chemistry represents an interesting

strategy to tackle the issues inherent to DRM. It appears that encapsu-
lating nanoparticles does prevent sintering, providing that the protect-
ing shell remains stable on the long run. Carbon formation within the
shells remains possible but its nucleation may be more contained than
on supported catalysts. The main issue of this technology is the tedious
synthesis  process  involving  a  multitude  of  expensive  surfactants  and
toxic organic solvents, which is not economical, scalable and presents
environmental implications. Less demanding synthesis process like sol-
gel  and  hydrothermal  do  not  yield  yet  small  homogeneous  nano-
particles. Another issue is the presence of un-encapsulated particles that
may accelerate the deactivation of the catalyst despite the encapsulated
particles  and  the  presence  of  empty  shells.  Additionally,  core-shell
structures  suffer  from  high  mass  transfer  barrier  due  to  their  small
pore size and tortuous pores. All of these aspects must be considered for
practical  utilisation  of  core/yolk-shell  catalysts  in  CO2  reforming  re-
actions  and  indeed  they  represent  a  technological  barrier  which  still

need to be overcome when realistic applications are envisaged. Recent
reviews on core/yolk shell catalysts for hydrocarbon reforming can be
found in ref [153,159].

• Sandwiched catalyst

A  new  method  to  increase  metal-support  interactions  and  hence
prevent sintering is the double protection of Ni particles in a sandwich-
like configuration. In this configuration, a protective overcoat is applied
on top of supported nanoparticles. The additional interactions induced
by the over-coat enhance the stabilisation of nanoparticles providing a
confinement effect. The porosity of the over-coat however is essential to
allow the reactive molecules to diffuse to the metal particle. Zhao et al.
reported  a  novel  Al2O3/Ni/Al2O3  sandwich  catalyst  for  DRM.  The
catalyst consists in a Ni impregnated on γ-alumina catalyst, upon which
a thin layer of porous alumina was deposited by means of atomic layer

deposition  (ALD).  In  this  way,  the  Ni  nanoparticles  benefited  from
double strong interactions between Ni and alumina. The porous alumina
film allowed the reactants to penetrate and interact with the Ni particles,
resulting  in  high  conversions.  Thicker  layer  of  alumina  resulted  in
higher stability especially for a long term 400 hours test, although this
test  was  performed  close  to  thermodynamic  equilibrium  conditions
which does not allow for a full deactivation study. The carbon deposition
was  very  limited  thus  proving  the  metal  agglomeration  control  [160,
161]. Similarly, Gould et al. reported a Ni on alumina catalyst stabilised
by  a  porous  alumina  layer  grown  by  ABC  alucone  molecular  layer
deposition  (MLD).  The  hybrid  polymer(cid:0) inorganic  alucone  MLD  layer
formed a porous alumina film over the nanoparticles after calcination.
Calcination  and  reduction  temperatures  dramatically  affect  the  MLD
layer and the amount of Ni exposed which ultimately affected the cat-
alytic activity. The overlayer effectively prevented sintering and yielded
a catalyst stable after multiple regenerations. Overall the thickness of
the layer affected the reaction rate but had a positive impact on stability
[162,163]. The possibility to form inactive NiAl2O4 is however possible
but  the  in  situ  reduction  occurring  during  reaction  could  activate
gradually the catalyst [164,165]. Following a similar concept, Cao et al.
deposited  atomically  thin  discontinuous  CoOx  layers  on  Ni  via  ALD.
They claim that the various CoOx crystalline structures produced a thin
meshed  Co  coating  on  the  Ni  particles.  The  Co-Ni  interface  reduced
carbon intermediates formation and accelerated carbon removal [166].
ALD and MLD are multi-step gas phase chemical processes that allow
the application of a protective over-coat on a supported catalyst through
chemical reactions between the surface functionality and the reactant
precursors. ALD is used for deposition of inorganic thin films like Al2O3,
ZnO or TiO2, while MLD can deposit hybrid inorganic organic thin films
like  Alucone  or  Zincone  [167].  Several  researchers  applied  these
methods  to  stabilised  nanoparticles.  Ma  et  al.  managed  to  stabilise
nanoparticles  of  5  nm  of  gold  on  TiO2  by  using  ALD  SiO2  overcoats
[168].  Feng  et  al.  reported  that  the  ALD  alumina  protective  layer
inhibited  the  sintering  of  supported  2  nm  Pd  nanoparticles  for  the
decomposition  of  methanol  reaction  [169].  The  stabilisation  and

protection of Ni particles was investigated in Qin’s group for hydroge-
nation  reactions.  Following  a  multi-confinement  strategy,  the  re-
searchers  coated  Ni  particles  inside  alumina  nanotubes,  using  carbon
nanotubes  (CNT)  as  template.  The  protection  of  Ni  by  this  alumina
overlayer  led  to  increased  conversion,  although  thin  coated  catalysts
underwent leaching and detachment [170]. Such a strategy is relevant
for DRM since leaching would not occur with a gas phase reaction. Work
from the same group involved the synthesis of a porous TiO2/Pt/TiO2
sandwich catalyst for the semi hydrogenation of alkyne to olefin. The
layered  structured  obtained  is  clearly  visible  in  the  TEM  images  pre-
sented in Figure 9. They ascribed the high selectivity of the catalyst to
the electron-rich features of the increased Pt-TiO2 interface sites [171].
Ingale  et  al.  prepared  alucone  coated  Ni/SiO2  by  MLD.  The  catalyst
showed much higher stability for DRM than its alumina coated by ALD
counterpart. The porosity of the alucone-based catalyst was much higher
and its coke resistance evidenced while the ALD produced catalyst may
have suffered from NiAl2O4 formation [161].

Instead of using ALD, Li et al. reported a simple and environmentally
friendly method to grow Al2O3 overlayers onto the surface of Ni/AlN via
room-temperature degradation of AlN. Since Ni2+
can incorporate into
the tetrahedral vacancies of the AlN, Ni@Al2O3/AlN benefits from dual
confinement effects. Al2O3 overlayers reduced the exposed surface of Ni
NPs and provided a barrier for the growth of carbon [172].

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has generated interest in catalysis
since it is a 2D material with oxidative resistance, and thermal stability.
Cao et al. took advantage of the 2D surface of h-BN to deposit Ni and
grow mesoporous silica shells on the produced material to prevent Ni
aggregation.  The  h-BN  supported  mesoSiO2-confined  Ni  catalyst  was
very stable for 100 hours and benefited from the coke resistance of h-BN,
the  confinement  effect  of  mesoSiO2,  the  strong  metal-support  in-
teractions and the synergistic effects of the nanoparticles of Ni and h-BN
interface to activate the reactants. Especially B-OH intermediate species
are  formed  and  participate  in  the  reaction  mechanism  [173].  Hence
there is a lot of opportunities using confinement strategies for the sta-
bilisation  of  nanoparticles.  Very  few  of  those  techniques  have  been

applied for DRM and there is a big avenue of research for those mate-
rials. Especially, all techniques aiming to increase metal support inter-
action or to combine various coatings are in need of deep spectroscopic
studies to understand those new interphase interactions.

On a different note, several researchers have reported sandwich-like
core shell catalysts. For instance, Bian et al. prepared a sandwich-like
silica@Ni@silica  multicore–shell  catalyst.  Ni  phyllosilicate  supported
on silica spheres constituted the core, as a silica layer was coated on top.
Different shell thicknesses were investigated, and thicker shells showed
reduced performance due to greater diffusion resistance. The catalysts
were  relatively  stable  for  24  hours  during  low  temperature  DRM
although some carbon deposition was witnessed. DRIFTS experiments
showed that the confinement effect within the silica shell inhibits linear
CO adsorption  and, thereby, reduces  carbon formation from the Bou-
douard reaction [174]. This operando spectroscopic study is a first step
to understand the mechanistic implications of the confinement effect.
Das  et  al.  from  the  same  group,  prepared  using  a  similar  method  a
Ni-SiO2@CeO2  sandwich  catalyst  were  nickel  particles  were  encapsu-
lated between silica and ceria. The ceria shell participated in the miti-
gation of carbon formation but promoted the RWGS reaction [175]. Dou
et al. investigated sandwiched SiO2@Ni@ZrO2 where nickel doped silica
spheres were prepared via so-gel method and coated with porous zir-
conia shell. The porous ZrO2  shell induced the uniform dispersion and
stabilization of 6 nm Ni nanoparticles, as without ZrO2 coating, large Ni
particles  of  33  nm  were  formed  on  the  surface  of  silica  spheres.  The
catalyst exhibited great carbon resistance and was active for 150 hours
with little deactivation [176].

• Tubular shaped and mesoporous catalysts

Still  with  the  aim  of  confining  nanoparticles,  some  researchers
attempted  with  more  or  less  success  to  insert  metallic  nanoparticles
inside tubular shaped materials. Coelho et al. prepared titanate nano-
tubes using a hydrothermal method, Ni and Co were inserted in the tubes
by ion exchange. The Co catalyst deactivated heavily due to carbona-
ceous deposit while the Ni catalyst showed some activity for 5 hours.
Metal trititanates  NiTiO3  formed during  the reaction, questioning  the
stability  of  the  catalyst  [177].  Monteiro  et  al.  produced  protonated
titanate nanotubes and sodium rich titanate nanotubes, coated them in
Ni  and  tested  them  for  DRM.  The  sodium  containing  catalyst  had  a
reduced  activity  compared  with  the  protonated  catalyst,  however  no
coke  was  formed  during  the  5  h  test.  On  the  other  hand,  the  treated
titanate nanotubes contained more than 20% coke [178]. Overall, the
use  of  titanate  nanotubes  does  not  appear  to  be  viable  for  the  dry
reforming of methane and additional research focusing on the stability
of such materials is needed.

Another  approach  is  the  encapsulation  of  particles  within  carbon
nanotubes.  For  instance,  successful  encapsulation  of  Mo2C  particles
promoted  with  Ni  and  Co  within  carbon  nanotubes  seems  to  be  an
effective choice. Although the Mo2C catalyst deactivated in 24 hours due
to oxidation, the Ni and Co promoted Mo2C catalysts were stable for 50
hours [179]. However, the use of carbon nanotubes for a reaction such
as dry reforming is not recommended due to the enhanced risk of carbon
nanotube growth and blockage of the reactor.

Mesoporous silica materials have been widely used in catalysis and

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience89(2022)10097015

come in multiple shapes. Confining nanoparticle in the cavities of 3D or
1D silica materials has been studied multiple times due to the increased
metal support interaction and sintering inhibition effect. Li et al. built 1D
nanotubes of silica containing nanoparticles of Ni dispersed on the inner
side on the tubes. To reach this structure, they produced Ni phyllosili-
cates nanotubes on which they coated SiO2  and obtained the catalyst
upon reduction. The produced catalyst exhibited high activity towards
DRM  but  was  subjected  to  deactivation  after  20  hours.  Strong  in-
teractions between Ni and the SiO2 shell as well as the confinement ef-
fect  prevented  the  sintering  of  Ni  nanoparticles.  However,  carbon
deposition  still  occurred  with  the  formation  of  13.4%  carbon  deposit
[180]. 3D mesoporous SiO2 is often used to confine particles but in the
case of DRM, the acidity of SiO2  does not improve CO2  activation and
hence causes deactivation from carbon deposition [181]. Although the
introduction of promoters like Ce and La can enhance CO2  activation,
only small amounts can be introduced to avoid the plugging of the pores
[182,183].

Alternatively, Ni nanoparticles can be embedded in the channels of
aluminium-modified SBA-15 AlSBA-15 using ethylene glycol as delivery
conveyor. Nanoparticles of 3.4 nm were formed are resisted sintering,
with  size  down  to  4.1  nm  after  reaction.  The  catalyst  was  relatively
stable for 20 hours and maintained its peas in a pod structure [184].
Going further, mesoporous alumina with highly ordered pores can be
produced by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and embedded
with active metals. Ni, Ni-Cu, Ni-Fe and Ni-Co alloys in particular were
incorporated  in  mesoporous  alumina  and  tested  for  DRM.  The  alloy
formation contributed to strong metal–support interactions which pre-
vented  thermal  sintering  in  synergy  with  the  confinement  effect.  The
well-ordered channels resisted a long term test and carbon nanotubes
were mainly form outside of the mesopores [185–187].

The confinement in mesopores advantage is therefore twofold, con-
sisting in protecting the metal nanoparticles against sintering but also
against coking in their vicinity due to steric constraints. The introduc-
tion of promoters such as La, Mg and Ca is beneficial to the activity but
none of these two additives has an effect on structural features, neither
on active phase dispersion. They rather impact the gasification of car-
bon. The quantity of additives needs to be carefully controlled to avoid
aggregation and pore blockage [188–190].

• Hydrotalcite

Hydrotalcite type compounds (HT) have the general formula [M2+

1-
xM3+
are metal cations
such as Mg2+
is an interlayer anion such as carbonate.
HT  materials  have  a  unique  layered  structure  where  the  2+ and  3+
metal  cations  are  randomly  distributed.  The  layers  are  composed  of
(cid:0)
octahedral units where the cations are in the centre of six OH
groups.
The octahedral units are connected by the edges thus forming parallel

and M3+

and An(cid:0)

layers [191]. Therefore, Ni ions can be carefully dispersed in the layered
structure benefiting from the insulation of Mg and Al ions, minimizing
nickel  aggregation  [192,193].  The  nature  and  relative  proportion  of
cations  and  interlayer  anions  allow  to  tailor  the  redox  and  acid/base
properties of the material. After thermal treatment, the dispersion of the
cations  in  the  different  layers  is  maintained  generating  stabilised
metallic particles [194].

The catalytic activity of HT derived materials is dependent on their
Mg/Al molar ratio. High concentration of Mg leads to enhanced activity
along with higher resistance to coke relative to Al-rich samples but leads
to the formation of MgNiO2. On the other hand, equimolar proportion
appears to be the optimum ratio for the formation of hydrotalcite and
the performance of the catalyst [195]. The Ni content of the materials
expressed as Ni/Mg or Ni/Al ratio also has an important impact on the
activity.  Overall  increasing  Ni  content  leads  to  increased  conversions
however, Ni particle size increases subsequently thus promoting carbon
formation [196]. Different promoters can be introduced into Ni/Mg/Al
hydrotalcite-derived mixed oxides, in particular Ce-promoted HT cata-
lysts benefit from the coke mitigation effect of ceria at low loadings, as
well as increased Ni reducibility [197,198]. Other promoters like Co, Rh,
Ru  and  La  have  been  investigated  and  resulted  in  increased  stability
[191]. Additionally, high temperature reducing treatment may alter the
◦
morphology of the catalyst. Reduction at 1000
C forms an overlayer of
NiAl2O4 on top of Ni particles as shown in Figure 10. This overlayer is
preferentially formed on small particles and only partially covers larger
ones. This phenomenon may be used to selectively block Ni nucleation
centres for carbon formation, however sufficient isolated sites need to
remain present in order to preserve the DRM activity [199].

• Hydroxyapatite

The  later  encapsulating  phenomenon  is  commonly  referred  to  as
strong  metal-support  interaction  (SMSI)  and  was  first  highlighted  by
Tauster  et  al. in  1978  to  justify  the  lack  of  H2  and  CO  adsorption  on
platinum group metals supported on TiO2 following a high temperature
reduction [200]. Many easily reducible oxides like TiO2, V2O3, Nb2O5,
Ta2O5, CeO2, and Fe2O3  display the same behaviour and the encapsu-
lation of metals by supports is clearly observed [201–203]. This phe-
nomenon  drastically  alters  the  catalytic  behaviour  of  a  material  by
modifying  the  electronic  and  geometric  properties  of  the  metal  NPs
[204–208].  More  recently,  beyond  reducible  oxides,  SMSI  have  been
formed  on  a  variety  of  other  materials,  following  high  temperature
oxidative  treatment.  Supports  like  transition-metal  carbides,  ZnO,
layered  double  oxides,  and  hydroxyapatite  have
formed  a
sub-nanometric layer on metal NPs [209–212].

Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a hexagonal phosphate of general formula
Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. Calcium cations and tetrahedral PO4  are compactly
arranged  to  form  two  unconnected  channels  of  2.5  and  3.5  Å.  The

channels are bordered by Ca2+
and host hydroxyl groups to reach charge
neutrality.  The  flexibility  of  the  structure  allows  for  various  sub-
stitutions and ions exchanges in its framework which can improve its
surface  properties  [213].  In  addition,  the  acid/base  properties  of  the
hydroxyapatite can be modified by adjusting the calcium to phospho-
rous ratio (Ca/P) [213,214]. Its high thermal stability makes it a good
candidate for dry reforming, not showing signs of sintering until 700
C
[215].

◦

Impregnation of Ni on HAP yielded active catalysts for DRM. Up to 2
wt.% loading, Ni cations are exchanged with Ca cations in the apatite
while above that threshold NiO particles are segregated on the surface
[216].  No  sintering  was  measured  after  a  90  h  test,  however  carbon
deposition still occurred [217]. Overall the Ca/P molar ratio has a strong
effect  on  the  activity  since  it  affects  the  acid/base  properties  of  the
material  as  well  as  their  textural  properties.  Calcium-deficient  HAP
(Ca/P molar ratio of 1.43) was found to be very active but not stable, due
to the lack of basic sites that favour CO2 dissociation [218,219]. On the
other  hand,  Boukha  et  al.  demonstrated  that  low  Ca/P  ratio  were
beneficial since it increased the content of strong acid sites which might
act  as  anchors  to  stabilise  Ni  particles,  and  improve  dispersion.  In
addition, increasing the Ca/P ratio decreased the specific surface area
and pore diameter and led to the segregation of a CaO phase [213].

Few studies have reported the deposition of single atom Ni on HAP
by strong electrostatic adsorption. SACs were found to be very active but
deactivation during time on stream was observed and attributed mainly
to the sintering and aggregation of nickel single-atoms rather than car-
bon  deposit.  Ce  doping  of  HAP  helped  stabilise  the  single  atoms  by
inducing strong metal-support interactions [147,220].

• Hexaaluminate

and O2(cid:0)

Hexaaluminate  materials  are  hexagonal  aluminate  of  general  for-
mula ABxAl12-xO19(cid:0) δ where A is a large cation, mono, di or trivalent such
as La, Ca, Ba, Sr or Na and B a transition metal or a noble metal which
can  substitute  Al  crystallographic  sites.  They  are  organised  in  layers
composed of spinel blocks of Al3+
ions separated by a mirror
plane where the A cation resides. Their high thermal stability, resistance
to  sintering  and  layered  structure  makes  them  suitable  for  high  tem-
perature catalytic reactions. Substitution of Ni into the lattice of hex-
aaluminates is a strategy to limit agglomeration of large nickel clusters
at high temperature. Moreover, the metal’s strong interaction with the
support and high dispersion should reduce carbon deposition. The va-
riety  of  cations  and  transition  metals  that  may  compose  the  hex-
aaluminate provides a lot of flexibility in the design of catalysts [221].
The amount of nickel substituted in the lattice has an important effect on
the activity, nevertheless, the more nickel is introduced, the more car-
bon is formed [222,223]. The reducibility of the hexaaluminate depends
on  the  size  of  the  cation  as  the  larger the  ionic  radius,  the  lesser  the
reduction temperature [224]. Xu et al. investigated the influence of the
nature of cation on the catalytic activity for DRM. Although all tested
catalysts were stable, the performance of the catalysts was rated in the
following  order:  LaNiAl11O19(cid:0) δ  > BaNiAl11O19(cid:0) δ  > SrNiAl11O19(cid:0) δ  >
CaNiAl11O19(cid:0) δ. Different additives were added to improve further the
La-based hexaaluminate. Substitution of La by cations such as Ca, Pr and
Ce increased the activity of the catalyst [225–227]. The addition of Pr
improved  the  dispersion  of  nickel.  It  also  enhanced  the  electronic
interaction  between  La  and  Ni  ions  which  maintained  Ni  at  a  lower
valence hence promoting the activation of CH4. Additionally, upon Pr
substitution  more Ni  ions were located in  the  octahedral sites,  which
were  easily  reduced  to  metallic  Ni  [225].   In  particular  La0.8Pr0.2-
NiAl11O19  showed stable conversions for 300 hours, however particle
agglomeration and carbon nanotube formation were detected [228].

• Perovskite

Perovskites and perovskite-type materials have the general formula

ABO3  and  A2BO4  respectively,  where  A  is  a  large  cation  (rare  earth,
alkaline  earth)  and  B  a  smaller  cation  (transition  metal).  The  partial
substitution of A and B ions with other ions is also possible in this type of
compounds, thus allowing to adjust their thermal stability and catalytic
performance [229]. The most commonly studied perovskite is LaNiO3,
which upon reduction treatment decomposes to well dispersed Ni par-
ticles supported on lanthanum oxide [230]. The reduction pre-treatment
has an impact on the size of the formed particles as well as the activity.
Reduction  of  the  catalyst  prior  DRM  results  in  larger  Ni  clusters  and
reduced activity. The introduction of the reactants at room temperature
prior heating resulted in smaller clusters [231]. This observation was
recently explained using in situ X Ray Diffraction (XRD). The reduction
in  reaction  mixture  of  rhombohedral  LaNiO3  occurs  through  the  suc-
cessive  formation  of  cubic  LaNiO3,  triclinic  LaNiO2.7  and  monoclinic
◦
LaNiO2.5.  At  670
C,  metallic  Ni  is  detected  with  the  formation  of
monoclinic  La2O2CO3  which  evolves  towards  hexagonal  La2O2CO3
◦
above 700
C. The active phase for
DRM is attributed to metallic Ni in contact with monoclinic La2O2CO3
where  La2O2CO3  provides  adsorbed  CO2  and  stabilise  Ni  particles.
Reduction  of  LaNiO3  under  hydrogen  presents  the  same  sequence  of
phases apart from the formation of La2O2CO3  which is a crucial inter-
mediate  specie  for  the  formation  of  the  coke  resistant  active  phase
[232].  Steady  state  tracing  experiments  demonstrated  that  La2O2CO3
actively participates as an intermediate in the production of CO and that
its  decomposition  to  CO  is  promoted  by  H  species  derived  from  CH4
decomposition [233].

C and hexagonal La2O3  above 750

◦

The LaNiO3 perovskite is very active for DRM sometimes up to 100
hours, however its shape and synthesis method strongly affect its per-
formance. Cube, sphere and rod shapes were investigated and showed
very  different  behaviour.  The  cubic  shape  presented  the  highest  con-
version whereas it enhanced coke deposition. The remarkable stability
of the spheres and rods, on the other hand, is explained by the small size
and high stability of the exsolved Ni crystals brought out by the 3-step
reduction pathway [234].

Since LaNiO3 decomposes to Ni/La2O3 rapidly, its stabilising effect is
relative. Attempts to stabilise the perovskite structure have been con-
ducted and partial substitution of Fe in the B site was found to form a La
(NiFe)O3  perovskite  structure  that  survives  during  the  DRM  reaction.
The  long-term  performance  is  hence  improved  by  providing  stronger
metal-support  interaction  hindering  sintering  but  the  overall  activity
decreased due to the lower reducibility of Fe and reduced mobility of
lattice oxygen species [235,236].

) or (A2+ ↔ A3+

Lattice oxygen is thought to act like an oxygen reservoir to oxidise
carbon and its consumption and regeneration is related to the cycling
oxidation state of neighbouring ions (A3+ ↔ A4+
). Hence
oxygen vacancies can be modulated by the substitution of a cation by
lower oxidation state cations or even higher  oxidation state cation to
attain a charge balance. The partial substitution of various elements (Ce,
Ca, Sr, Sm, Nd) in the A site or other metals (Ru, Co) in the B site allows
to ensure small metal crystallites and high oxygen mobility in the metal
oxide [237–240]. The substitution of La by Ce or Pr even in small pro-
portion prevents carbon formation and hence leads to superior activity.
The RWGS reaction however is favoured on Ce enriched surface [30].
The degree of substitution plays also a major role, as small amounts of Sr
increase carbon deposition in the form of filaments but higher amounts
tend to suppress coking and increase CO2  consumption and CO forma-
tion [241].

Although Lanthanum based perovskite are widely studied other pe-
rovskites  have  shown  impressive  performance.  Dama  et  al.  reported
alkaline earth-based MZr1-xNixO3-δ perovskites for DRM. Sr and Ba based
materials deactivated rapidly due to the growth of graphitic carbon as
well as the formation of nickel carbide. CaZr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ, on the other
hand  was found  stable for  500 hours,  although this test  was  not per-
formed  in  the  kinetic  regime  and  hence  the  results  must  be  carefully
interpreted.  The  superior  activity  of  this  material  was  related  to  its
higher  oxygen  defect  sites,  stronger  metal  support  interaction  and

surface hydroxyl groups controlling carbon formation [237]. Evans et al.
developed  a  Ni0.2Sr0.8ZrO3  catalyst  for  biogas  reforming.  Although
performing under excess methane, carbon deposition was contained to 3
mg of carbon after 25 days of test under thermodynamic regime [239].
The  use  of  perovskite  precursor  catalysts  for  DRM  relies  on  the
exsolution  of  Ni  particles  at  the  surface  of  the  catalyst  upon  pre-
treatment yielding higher dispersion than impregnated catalysts. Dur-
ing reaction those particles are prone to sinter and to be coated in car-
bon. A thermal treatment on the used catalyst in oxidising atmosphere
can  remove  the  carbon  deposited,  however  redispersing  Ni  particles
remains a challenge. In the case of perovskites, the regeneration of the
original  perovskite  precursor  is  possible  by  oxidation.  Hence  the
regeneration  of  poisoned DRM catalysts  is  made possible  to a  certain
degree. The regenerated perovskite may have a different crystallinity,
but  redispersion  of  Ni  particles  has  been  witnessed,  as  shown  in
Figure  11  which  in  principle  ensure  activity  recovery  after  catalyst
regeneration [242].

• Pyrochlore compounds

Pyrochlores are highly crystalline and thermally stable mixed oxides
of general formula A2B2O7. The A-site is occupied by a large rare-earth
trivalent metal while the B site is occupied by a tetravalent transition
metal of smaller diameter. The crystalline phase structure of an A2B2O7
compound is decided by the rA/rB radius ratio. If this ratio is above 1.78,
a monoclinic layered perovskite phase is formed while in the range of
1.46–1.78, an ordered pyrochlore phase is formed. The ordered pyro-
chlore phase can be described as an ordered defective fluorite, in which
1/8 of the oxygen anions are unoccupied. If the radius ratio is below
1.46, a disordered defective fluorite phase is obtained and close to 1.17 a
rare earth C-type phase is produced [243].

Their  great  oxygen  mobility  and  resilience  to  high  temperatures
make  them  suitable  for  reforming  reactions  [244].  Pyrochlores  with
various A-site and B-site cations were tested as support for the steam
reforming  of  methane.  Ni/Ln2Zr2O7  and  Ni/La2Sn2O7  with  various
lanthanide cations were tested and Y2Zr2O7  and La2Zr2O7  showed the
best  performance  and  carbon  resistance  [244–246].  The  cation  used
affects the crystalline structure of the pyrochlore and strongly alters its
properties.  Beyond  reforming,  pyrochlores  have  been  used  for  the

hydrogenation of CO and CO2 towards methanol, where a Cu/La2Zr2O7
catalyst  displayed  high  coke  resistance  [247].  Mobile  active  oxygen
species have been found to be formed on the surface of pyrochlores with
a  higher  degree  of  disorder  [248].  However,  although  pyrochlores
exhibit great properties for catalytic reactions, they are limited by their
low surface area, thus restraining their use as support.

However, with the aim  of stabilising metals in a crystal structure,
metal substituted pyrochlores have been investigated. Weng et al. pre-
viously reported the high activity and stability of La2Ce2-xRuxO7 for the
autothermal steam reforming of ethanol [249] and La2Ce2(cid:0) xNixO7(cid:0) δ  for
the oxidative steam reforming of ethanol [250]. The metal substituted
pyrochlores  were  prepared  by  a  sol-gel  method  and  subsequently
impregnated  on  a  large  surface  area  γ-alumina  support.  Metals  were
successfully doped in the pyrochlore structure up to a critical amount
and high catalytic activity was observed. However, upon reaction, some
deactivation was witnessed and the pyrochlore was found to react with
the support to form LaAlO3. Moreover, the nickel doped catalyst showed
great deactivation after 70 hours of reaction. In addition to the forma-
tion of small nanoparticles of Ni, the authors claim that the substitution
of Ni not only induced the formation of Ce3+
and oxygen vacancies, but
also caused the unit cell expansion [250]. The dry reforming of methane
is a much more demanding reaction where oxygen availability is key to
the stability of the process. La2Zr2O7  pyrochlores doped on the B site
with various metals have been investigated for DRM [251,252]. Small
amounts  of  Rh,  Ru,  Pt  and  Ni  were  substituted,  and  the  noble
metal-based catalysts were found to be very active and stable even at
low temperature where carbon deposition is favoured. However, nickel
substitution did not appear to induce any activity after a few hours. The
loading of metal (1 wt.% Ni) was in fact too low to function and deac-
tivation  was  caused  by  deposition  of  polymeric  carbon  and  carbon
whiskers [253]. However, the introduction of larger amounts of nickel
led to the formation of a double perovskite phase La2ZrNiO6, which was
active for over 360 hours [252]. The pyrochlore/perovskite catalyst was
found to exsolve nanoparticles of Ni during the reaction, limiting the
agglomeration  of  particles.  Exsolution  of  transition  metals  is  a  smart
catalyst design approach for energy applications in particular when the
metal has a good ability to exsolve under a reducing or reaction envi-
ronments  [252].  It  is  an  efficient  approach  to  produce  catalysts  with
high  metal  dispersion,  very  small  particle  size,  and  improved

metal–support  interaction.  Exsolution  can  be  a  reversible  process  via
oxidation  at  high  temperature,  where  the  original  structure  may  be
restored.  As  demonstrated  elsewhere,  a  defective  fluorite  Sm2Ru0.2-
Ce1.8O7 phase was reduced to a C-type structure Ru0/Sm2Ce1.8O7(cid:0) δ via a
rearrangement of the oxygen vacancies that concentrate around the Ru
atoms within the crystal lattice of Sm2Ru0.2Ce1.8O7  [254].The catalyst
yield dispersed 1-2 nm Ru NPs and Ru exsolution and dissolution cycles
could be performed for at least two cycles.

Wu  et  al.  even  suggested  that  atomically  dispersed  particles  were
formed on the surface of Rh doped La2Zr2O7  pyrochlore while Rh NPs
were formed on La2Ti2O7 layered perovskite. CO adsorption followed by
DRIFTS evidenced the absence of bridged-CO species on the zirconate
pyrochlore while the titanate perovskite exhibited bridged-CO species
and a red shift with increasing CO coverage indicating Rh atoms were
singly  dispersed  on  the  La2Zr2O7  support  but  not  on  La2Ti2O7.  X-ray
absorption  near-edge  spectroscopy  (XANES)  and  extended  X-ray  fine
structure (EXAFS) showed in Figure 12, confirmed the absence of peaks
belonging  to  the  Rh–Rh  coordination  shell  in  the  zirconate  sample.
Although single-atom Rh displayed superior activity for CH4  dissocia-
tion, the catalyst was deemed inefficient for DRM owing to rapid coking.
On  the  other  hand,  the  titanate  sample  was  very  stable  with  limited
carbon deposition due to the promoted O migration induced by accel-
erated electron transport [255].

A  very  interesting  aspect  of  these  highly  active  pyrochlore  based
catalyst is their low surface area. For instance, BET areas in the range of
(cid:0) 1  of catalysts have been reported for high performing cata-
7-12 m2  g
lysts  [252,256].  The  later,  in  principle  contradicts  what  is  generally
accepted in heterogenous catalysis – larger surface area results in greater
surface/volume ratio and higher catalytic activity since there are more
chances for the reactants to get activated on the catalysts surface. These
materials demonstrate that such a rule of thumb is not always applicable
and low-surface area systems if carefully engineered can display excel-
lent performance.

7. Emerging technologies for DRM

Besides  the  design  of  increasingly  complex  catalyst  morphologies,
other  alternatives  are  being  investigated  to  overcome  the  catalyst
deactivation constraints of the dry reforming reaction and improve the
overall efficiency of the process. Solar thermal flow reactors, plasma-
assisted  reactors,  membrane  reactors,  magnetic  induction  heating  re-
actors,  and  electrochemical  routes  represent  alternatives  to  classic
thermal catalysis but are not mature enough for commercialisation due
to prohibitive cost. The overriding ideas behind these approaches as well
as their current technology status are discussed in the next section.

7.1. Plasma assisted dry reforming

Plasma  catalysis  is  an  emerging  discipline  which  deals  with  the
application of a plasma source to facilitate chemical reactions. The term
plasma catalysis is employed equally to describe both the use of plasma
to initiate a reaction directly and the use of plasma in combination with
a  catalyst  for  that  particular  reaction.  Briefly,  under  plasma  catalysis
conditions a mixture of excited species including ions, radicals, atoms,
molecules  and  free  electrons  is  generated.  Hence  standard  models  of
chemistry and conventional understanding of reaction mechanisms start
to become less relevant due to the non-equilibrium concentration of the
excited species [257].

The  application  of  non-thermal  plasma (NTP)  for  CO2  conversion,
CH4 activation and hence DRM processes has flourished in last few years
and it is positioned among the most promising applications of plasma
catalysis [258,259]. Given the high chemical stability of CO2 and CH4,
traditional thermal catalysis processes such as DRM requires significant
amount of energy (thermal energy) to proceed with acceptable yields. In
order  to  circumvent  the  energy  demands  NTP-catalytic  conversion  of
CO2/CH4  mixtures  is  considered  a  very  promising  alternative  since
plasma  can  activate  both  molecules  at  ambient  pressure  and  room
temperature. Such promising behaviour relies on the synergistic effects
of plasma and catalysts which lead to higher efficiencies and excellent
selectivity levels compared to thermal catalysis. Figure 13a summarises
the different contributions leading to plasma-catalysts synergies and it
showcases  the  remarkable  activity  enhancement  for  DRM  using  a
bimetallic Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Briefly the synergistic effects fall within
two categories namely effects of catalysts on plasma and effect of plasma
on catalysts. The later referrers to the well reported multiple electronic
and structural modifications that plasma induces on reforming catalysts.
For  example,  greater  active  phase  dispersion  and  larger  surface  area
[260,261],  surface  reconstruction  with  enhances  concentration  of
corner active sites and vacancies [262], lower activation energies and
higher  pre-exponential  factors  pushing  forward  the  reactions  [263],
changes on active species oxidation state [264], formation of catalysts
hot spots due to small micro-discharges and collision induced-chemistry
[263].  On  the  other  hand,  the  selected  catalysts  also  alter  plasma
properties  enhancing  the  electric  field,  leading  to  stronger  discharge
than that of unpacked reactors (packed bed effect) which results in the
production  of  electrons  with  a  higher  average  electron  temperature
[265].

The  overall  synergistic  effect  typically  leads  to  advanced  catalytic
performance.  Indeed,  as  depicted  in  Figure  13c,  the  DRM  reaction  is
significantly  boosted  over  a  Cu-Ni  catalysts  when  the  process  is  con-
ducted  under  NTP  conditions.  The  data  from  Zhang  and  co-workers

reveals that the impact of plasma is not a simple additive effect (i.e. the
summative  benefits  of  adding  a  catalyst  and  conducting  the  reaction
under NTP) but there is a clear synergy leading to highly commendable
results [262].

These  special  features  of  plasma  driven  catalysed  reforming  re-
actions can also be used to overcome traditional limitations of the DRM
reaction such as H2/CO ratio limit (typically set as 1 in the best-case
scenario  for  pure  dry  reformers),  the  selectivity  towards  more
advanced products beyond syngas and severe catalysts deactivation due
to carbon deposition [266]. In fact, NTP has been successfully applied to
enable  thermodynamic  unfavourable  reactions  unlocking  their  poten-
tials at close to room temperature and ambient pressure. For instance,
Tu et al. demonstrated that the thermodynamically limited H2/CO ratio
in standard DRM can be increased from 0.84 (thermal catalysis) to 2.53

attributed to spatially limited discharges in voids of the packed reactor
and  surface  discharges  on  the  catalysts  surface  [267].  Such  results
achieved in a cold plasma avoiding external heating showcase the clear
potential  of  plasma  catalysis  to  circumvent  the  trade-off  among

Concerning DRM selectivity beyond syngas, plasma-catalysis opens a
new spectrum of possibilities including the direct production of added
value  oxygenated and  C-C  coupling products. For  instance, the direct
production  of  methanol  or  acetic  acid  from  CO2/CH4  mixtures  repre-
sents a step ahead in reforming technologies. Thermal catalysis can only
deliver  these  advanced  products  via  multistep  routes  involving  heat
exchange, compression and intercooling ascribed to high-pressure pro-
cesses with elevated capital and operational cost. In a typical thermal
process, syngas produced in thermal DRM could be fed to a methanol
synthesis reactor (CO + 2H2  ⇋  CH3OH) at 40-100 bar and 220-280
C
which  are  standard  industrial  methanol  production  conditions  [268].
Herein we need to consider also catalysts deactivation and regeneration
and its associated cost. Similarly, for acetic acid, very few studies report
the direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 to CH3COOH via thermal catalysis

at  temperatures  of  ca.  250
C  and  always  with  very  low  yields
[269–272].  The  main  limitations  to  achieve  practical  yields  of  acetic
acid  are  the  energy  needed  to  overcome  the  slowest  reaction  step
(methane dissociative adsorption) along with the need to generate key
intermediate  species  for  the  C-C  coupling  [273].  In  this  sense,  the

assistance  of  plasma  is  optimal  to  overcome  dissociative  adsorption
barrier and generate highly reactive CH4* and CH3* species in the gas
phase  to  trigger  the  reaction.  Indeed,  a  very  good  approach  to  DRM
kinetics under NTP conditions was conducted by Nozaki’s team [274].
Using  a  La-promoted  Ni/Al2O3  catalysts  they  demonstrated  that  C-H
activation on CH4  via vibrational excitation under plasma conditions.
The C-H bond in such vibrationally excited methane molecule is more
prone  to  be  broken  since  it  presented  a  lower  activation  barrier
(Figure 14). Lowering methane activation barrier has a direct impact on
the calculated Arrhenius activation energies for the DRM process which

(cid:0) 1 for the thermally catalysed reaction (Figure 14).
Besides methane activation another crucial endothermic step in the
C-C coupling takes places via: CHx + CO2  ⇋  CH3COOH. This reaction
 ̅
step relies on the formation of CO2
intermediate which is very hard in
thermal conditions, but it is favoured under plasma given the interaction
of CO2 with excited electrons [275]. In fact, the interaction with excited
electrons and ionised species within plasma can also be regarded as a
route to promote the hydrogenation capacity of CH4  to replace H2  in
some processes such as direct synthesis of methanol and acetic acid from
CO2/CH4 mixtures including biogas.

Under these premises, the  pioneering work of Wang et al. demon-
strates a unique route for direct and one-step reforming of CO2 and CH4
to produce added value products such as methanol, ethanol, formic acid,
acetic acid, formaldehyde and acetone at room temperature and atmo-
spheric pressure using a NTP system [276]. In this work a total selec-
tivity to oxygenates is ca. 60% with a 40.2% selectivity to acetic acid as
main liquid end product. This is a highly commendable result and the
highest  selectivity  value  reported  so  far  for  this  process  once  again
pointing the suitable features of NTP to overcome thermodynamic re-
strictions usually encountered in the thermal catalysis.

Along with the selected catalysts and the plasma reaction conditions
(power  input,  flow  rate,  energy  efficiency,  space  velocity,  etc.)  the
reactor  design  plays  a  major  role  on  the  selectivity  towards  liquid
products.  Temperature  control  is  one  of  the  key  parameters  in  this
respect.  A  remarkable  methanol  and  formic  acid  selectivity  drop  was
observed by Eliasson et al due to reactor temperature increase from room

Considering the boiling points of the added value products mentioned
above (i.e. CH3OH: 64.7

importance to implement a cooling system to maintain the temperature

Alcohols  and  carboxylic  acids are  not the  only  advanced products
reachable via plasma catalysis DRM, C2+ hydrocarbons also outstand as
potential  end  products  for  plasma  reforming  reactions.  In  fact,  if  we
consider  CO2  as  a  mild-soft  oxidant,  we  could  envisage  the  oxidative
coupling  of  methane  (OCM)  as  an  alternative  route  for  CH4/CO2
upgrading. Given the large reservoirs of natural gas and the excess of
CO2 emissions derived from industrial activities, the production of C2+
hydrocarbons, such as C2H4  or other petrochemically relevant product
from  OCM  is  deemed  as  an  interesting  route  from  greenhouse  gases
valorisation.  In a seminal study  by Liu the  viability of this route was
demonstrated [279]. Plasma assisted DRM reaction was investigated to

produced C2H4 and C2H6 following the reactions below:

2CH4 + CO2

C2H6 + CO + H2O

Conversion of methane and carbon dioxide reached 25-80% and 8-
40% respectively with a very promising yield towards C2 products of 20-
45%. Plasma parameters such as Specific Energy Input (SEI) affects the
selectivity of the C-C coupling process. For instance, in a recent study
using  a  Mg  promoted  Ni/Al2O3  catalyst  the  selectivity  to  C2H6  was
negatively affected upon increasing SEI but in turn the syngas produc-
tion was enhanced [280]. A summary of some of the most remarkable
results  for  C2+ production  via  plasma  assisted  DRM  is  presented  in
Table 3.

A  final  remark  on  plasma  technologies  for  DRM  is  its  potential
application  for  catalysts  regeneration.  In  traditional  thermal  catalysis
regeneration  implies  the  supply  of  gaseous  reactive  species  at  high
temperatures with a marked process cost. Contrariwise, plasma regen-
eration permits the reduction of oxidised catalysts and removal of poi-
sons and solid carbon deposits at low temperature and ambient pressure.
The  energetic  species  produced  in  non-thermal  plasma  can  initiate
diverse reactions and open up or enhance reaction pathways other than
those expected for equilibrium chemistry. As thermal regeneration can
result  in  catalyst  sintering  and  thus  a  reduced  number  of  active  sites
while plasma is a viable alternative to thermal treatment. The reader is
referred to a recent review by Lee and co-workers where the advantages
of  plasma  are  thoroughly  discussed  as  more  cost-effective  way  than
conventional thermal treatment for catalysts regeneration [281].

Overall plasma catalysis is  rapidly emerging as a  ground-breaking
alternative  to  conduct  DRM  reactions  presenting  multiple  advantages
over traditional thermal catalysis. However there is currently no known
large-scale  industrial  applications  combining  plasma  and  a  catalytic
material. This is mainly due the knowledge gaps in the field given its
complexity laying in the interface of physics, chemistry, engineering and
electronics. Fruitful cooperation among multidisciplinary teams  is ex-
pected in the near future to unlock the full potential of this promising
technology for advanced reforming reactions and beyond.

7.2. Photocatalysis

An alternative way to decrease the reaction temperature of DRM is
the utilisation of light energy. The use of photon energy can promote a
reaction  at  low  temperature,  beyond  thermodynamic  limits  since  it
compensates the increase  of Gibbs free  energy of the reaction  system
[282]. In a photocatalytic process, the key factor to reach high efficiency
is the capacity of the semiconductor to absorb visible and infrared light
as  well  as
its  ability  to  suppress  the  rapid  combination  of
photo-generated electrons and holes. Furthermore, the band structure of
semiconductor should match with the reaction redox potentials [283].
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by CH4 was first reported over
ZrO2  and MgO under UV-light irradiation [284]. After 5 hours of irra-
diation, 3.6 μmol of CO and 0.05 μmol of H2 were formed over MgO at
room  temperature.  More  recently  Tahir  et  al.  reported  a  nickel  and

increasing  electrons  transportation  and  enhancing  the  stability.  Since
syngas yields are very low using photocatalysis, the combination of both
thermo energy and photo energy in a single process was proposed and
referred  to  as  photothermo  DRM  (PTDRM).  For  example,  Pan  et  al.
demonstrated that under solar irradiation at 600
C the production rates
of H2 and CO were 5 and 2 times higher respectively than those obtained
in the dark at the same temperature as shown in Table 4 [286]. They
used a Pt supported Si-modified CeO2 since Pt is active for DRM and acts
as co-catalyst for photocatalysis. CeO2 is known to help coke mitigation
and its band structure matches with the CO2 reduction and CH4 oxida-
tion redox potentials. Si was incorporated to CeO2 to create more oxygen
vacancies that help to form continuous band states that narrow the band
gap and enhance solar absorption.

In 2015, the  use of local surface  plasmon resonances  (LSPRs) was
proposed to enhance the photocatalytic activation of CO2  [287]. Gold
for example has LSPR properties when irradiated with photon energy,
generating positive ions and electrons on its local surface. Additionally it
is not active for DRM while group VIII metals are active but the effects of
photons  on  the  excitation  of  molecules  would  not  be  well  witnessed
since the photon energy would be transformed into thermal energy. Gold
was found to effectively enhance DRM on Rh/SBA-15 under visible-light

metals, like Ni, Rh and Fe which can all be adopted as plasmonic pro-
moter [288]. In particular, this allowed to reach CO2  and CH4  conver-
sions  of  21  and  20  %  respectively  over  a  plasmonic  Ni/Al2O3

photocatalyst at low temperature, 200
C under visible light [289]. This
demonstrates the feasibility of non-precious photocatalysts for efficient
low temperature photo-assisted DRM.

7.3. Solar thermochemical reactor

Thermally-driven catalysis is the most studied way to perform DRM
however  the  high  temperatures  required  involves  the  combustion  of
fossil  fuels  to  supply  the  process  heat.  The  utilisation  of  heat  from
concentrated  solar  radiation  would  increase  the  efficiency  and  limit
about 21% of the CO2 emissions of the process [290]. Additionally, DRM
can be used as a way to store energy through the conversion of solar heat
to chemical fuels in certain regions of the globe. Dry reforming has been
investigated as a solar thermochemical conversion process for more than
30 years. Specific reactor designs have been developed to use concen-
trated solar radiation as energy source, resulting in two categories.

The first concept consists in the indirect heating of the catalyst. The
solar  energy  can  be  collected  in  a  volumetric  receiver  and  the  heat
produced used in a separate reformer like during the ASTERIX project
conducted between Germany and Spain [291], or the solar radiation can
be  directed  onto  the  reactor  tube  where  the  metal  wall  absorbs  the

radiation, indirectly heating the catalyst as developed by the Weizmann
Institute of Science (WIS) in Israel [292]. The heat medium can be air,
sodium vapours, molten salts or solid particles like porous graphite. WIS
co-developed a sodium reflux solar reformer for DRM where liquid so-
dium is evaporated by the concentrated sunlight and the formed vapours
condense on the reactor tubes, liberating the heat of vaporisation [293].
The high flammability of Na vapours however, limits the interest in this
technology. Molten salts like molten nitrates and carbonates have the
capacity to store heat effectively and are used to provide a constant-rate
solar heat supply to the catalyst. Indeed, one of the essential problems in
solar  reforming  is  fluctuating  incident  solar  radiation  due  to  cloud
passage thus preventing stable operation. Heat can be exchange from the
molten  salt  to  the  catalyst  across  an  intervening  wall  separating  the
reaction from the molten salt in a “double-walled” tubular absorbers/-
reformers configuration. Or the molten salt can be directly mixed with
the  catalyst  powder  in  the  reactor  where  the  preheated  reactants  are
introduced at the bottom, forming a “liquid bed”. This Direct Contact
Bubble Reactor (DCBR) configuration allows to steadily supply heat to
the catalyst while avoiding heat loss due to the absence of any inter-
vening  wall  separating  the  processing  fluids  [294].  Molten  salts  are
however limited by their decomposition temperature which generally
C,  although  some  salt
prevents  operation  at  temperatures  above  800
mixtures can be stable at higher temperatures. Alternatively, graphite
has  also  been  used  as  heat  transfer  material.  A  triple-concentric-tube
concept  has  been  developed  consisting  of  an  outer  tube  of  quartz,  a
central  tube  of  solid  graphite  and  an  inner  tube  of  porous  graphite.
Sunlight heats the central graphite tube through the quartz layer, and
heat irradiates to the porous graphite. Argon is passed between the two
graphite  tubes  to  provide  a  non-oxidising  atmosphere.  Some  carbon
particles are however formed and flowed with the reactant gas. They are
believed to enhance the radiative heat transfer in the process, justifying
the terminology of “aerosol” reactor. This system allows to reach tem-
peratures of 1700

C [295].

On the other hand, in a direct absorption concept, the receiver and
the reformer are combined in a unique unit as represented in Figure 15.
The  reformer  reactor  is  equipped  with  a  quartz  window  as  aperture
where  the  concentrated  solar  radiation  enters  and  is  absorbed  by  a
catalytically  active  absorber  system  (CAS)  as  developed  during  the
CAESAR  project  between  Germany  and  the  USA,  the  SCR  project  be-
tween Germany and WIS or within the EU-project SOLREF [296,297].
The absorber acts as catalyst, heat transfer unit as well as solar absorber
and hence requires several components. The CAS consists of a matrix
material benefiting from a geometry that allow effective and uniform
absorption of solar radiation as well as high gas permeability, turbulence
of  flow,  low  pressure  drop,  high  thermal  resistance  and  good  heat
transfer [298]. Typically, reticulated ceramic foams are used, based in
alumina or SiC, or metal foams such as Ni–Cr–Al metal foam [299], 316
stainless steel foam [300], and Cu foam [301]. A washcoat layer is then
deposited to increase the surface area. An absorber material is added
allowing  the  good  absorption  of  the  solar  radiation  through  its  low
hemispherical reflectivity while being temperature resistant and chem-
ically  inert.  And  finally  the  catalyst  layer  completes  the  CAS,  which
needs to be resistant to coking, poisoning and high temperature as in
thermal catalysis. The direct heating of the catalyst results in reduced
heat  losses due  to high  solar  flux  capability, fast  response  to thermal
transients and higher efficiency [302]. During the SOLASYS project, SiC
foam coated with alumina and rhodium was used in a solar reformer to
produce syngas at 8.5 bar, 760
C, in the 100-220 kW power range to
yield conversions close to equilibrium [303]. The SOLREF project aims
to scaled-up to a power level of 400 kW [304].

Solar driven dry reforming was proved to be effective at pilot scale in
various projects allowing to reduce fuel consumption of thermal DRM.
However,  problems  related  to  the  intermittent  nature  of  solar  energy
remain. Large scale production and 24/7 operations still need demon-
stration before commercialisation.

Since DRM is highly endothermic and operates at high temperatures,
heat transfer is a key parameter to establish a more efficient process. As
previously  mentioned,  large  temperature  gradients  and  unequal  tem-
perature distribution lead to catalyst deactivation. Induction heating is
an efficient and fast alternative to provide energy to the system. This
implies  the  heating  of  electrically  conductive/magnetic  materials
without contact, directly generating heating heat in the material of in-
terest,  minimizing  heat  loss  and  energy  consumption.  Here,  an  oscil-
lating  magnetic  field  is  applied  to  a  susceptor  which  produces  heat
through two physical phenomena: eddy currents and magnetic hyster-
esis. Eddy currents provoke heat by Joule effect while hysteresis heating
occurs  when  a  ferromagnetic  material  cycles  through  the  magnetic
loop  [305].  Few  works  have  been  conducted  on
hysteresis
induction-heated catalysis for organic synthesis and methanation reac-
tion,  and  this  technology  was  recently  applied  to  steam  and  dry
reforming [306–308]. In order to produce an induction-heated catalyst,
the material must contain catalytically active metals and be ferromag-
netic  or ferrimagnetic. To  reach reaction temperature, the Curie  tem-
perature of the material must at least be equal to that temperature. Very
few pure metals have a high Curie temperature, of which Ni, Fe and Co

supported  on  MgAl2O4  were  first  produced  and  tested  for  steam
reforming yielding high methane conversion heated by induction alone.
◦
The  catalyst  could  be  heated  to  temperatures  above  780
C  by  the
oscillating  magnetic  field  alone  [306].  Improvement  of  the  catalyst
synthesis and composition were found to increase both the hysteresis
opening and steam reforming catalytic activity, opening up possibilities
of  producing  better  catalysts  by  engineering  the  reactivity,  as  this  is
presently the limiting factor [307]. Polycrystalline microsized Ni60Co40
alloy powders compacted into discs were tested for DRM and actively
interacted with an alternating magnetic field heating up to temperatures
C. No decrease in hydrogen production was found over
as high as 950
50 h of use, demonstrating limited carbon poisoning. Although, the alloy
was  not  dispersed  nor  supported  on  a  substrate  and  annealing  phe-
nomena  could  in  principle  deactivate  it.  Overall  optimisation  of  the
magnetic material, surface, loading and shape (size of the pellet, use of
gas permeable magnetic foam, etc...) are expected to significantly in-
crease the energetic efficiency of the reforming process which opens a
large avenue of progress [308]. As shown in Figure 16, varying the mass
and  volume  of  sample  can  allow  to  reach  higher  temperatures  at  an
input power, due to the larger eddy currents induced in the sample thus
there is a lot of room to improve process efficiency. Induction heating
offers fast heating responses, simplifies the process through the removal
of waste-heat recovery sections and allows for a reduction in size of the
process, paving the way for the development of small-scale reforming

units  with  reduced  energy  costs.  More  information  about  induction
heating in catalytic processes can be found in ref [309].

7.5. Microwave-assisted DRM

Another way to provide heat to the system is through the application
of microwave (MW) heating. Similarly to induction heating, MW heating
allows for fast energy transmission without contact and high efficiency
compared  to  conventional  heating.  Electromagnetic  waves  interact
directly and selectively with the components that can absorb MW energy
in the catalyst, providing heat to the rest of the catalyst. Additionally
MW were found to have an effect on the gaseous reactants, allowing to
reduce  the  activation  energy  of  the  reaction  and  to  operate  at  lower
pressure and temperature. This enhancement of the reaction rate under
MW  irradiation  is  due  to  two  factors  referred  as  thermal  and  non-
thermal  effects.  The  main  factor  considered  responsible  for  the
increased performance under MW irradiation is the thermal effect. Some
regions of the catalyst may absorb more MW creating an inhomogeneity
of the field distribution along the sample, resulting in local hot-spots or
micro plasma. These local surfaces at higher temperature may accelerate
the dissociation of adsorbed species and enhance the reaction rate [310].
However  other  non-thermal  phenomena  may  also  have  an  intrinsic
catalytic effect, although it is widely debated in the literature. Zhou et al.
proposed a model of the interactions between MW and molecules. They
advanced that a portion of the MW energy is adsorbed by the molecules
which reduces the energy of activation while another is released by the
MW thermal effect to the chemical reaction system. The first adsorption
changes the interior energy level of the molecules. The electromagnetic
field  created  also  affects  the  motion  and  collision  rate  of  molecules.
Hence the molecular rotational energy level under MW irradiation could
change,  leading  to  a  decrease  in  the  activation  energy  for  reactions
involving a polar transition state. The electron cloud distribution, bond
length and bond angle could as well be affected. Therefore, non-thermal
effects  could  cause  molecules  in  the  reaction  to  become  activated,
resulting in facile reactions [311].

MW-assisted  methane  dry  reforming  has  been  studied  by  many
groups for the past two decades. Much higher performance are obtained
using MW relative to the conventional heating over catalyst at the same
temperature and condition [312,313]. The use of MW irradiation also
appears to reduce carbon deposition thanks to the strong MW absorption
capacity of carbon-based materials. In fact, the gasification of carbon by
CO2 (reverse Boudouard reaction, eq. 9) was studied by Hunt et al. under
MW  heating.  The  apparent  activation  energy  dropped  from  118.4  kJ

comes the major product from 643
space-charge mechanism forms electron(cid:0) hole pairs at the surface of the
carbon which interact with CO2 [314]. However this phenomenon may
deteriorate the catalysts based in carbon. Indeed carbon-based materials
have  been  predominantly  used  as  a  catalyst  in  MW-assisted  dry
reforming considering their strong MW absorption capacity. To produce
a catalyst for MW-assisted DRM, one must use a material catalytically
active and susceptible to microwaves, able to heat rapidly and homo-
geneously. When subjected to MW irradiation, materials can allow MW
to pass through, acting like an insulator such as ceramics and quartz,
reflect them, acting like a conductor such as metals or absorb them and
generate heat such as carbon materials or silicon carbide. Hence direct
heating requires some part of the catalyst to absorb MW or to mix the
catalyst with a susceptor. The low penetration depth and high dielectric
loss of carbon allows it to absorb MW energy efficiently. In practice, the
charges on the carbon surface are separated by Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars
polarization, which leads to dielectric loss. The electrons fast movement
generate  heat  on  the  surface  which  facilitates  the  dissociation  of
adsorbed species [315].

Various catalysts were investigated, in particular Ni-based catalysts
mixed with various types of activated carbon as absorber since carbon-

based catalyst have reduced activity for DRM [316–318]. The presence
of metals however implies MW reflection which affects the efficiency of
MW heating. The presence of catalyst supports may alter the dielectric
and magnetic properties of catalysts significantly since most metal ox-
ides support used in DRM and reported previously have negligible MW
absorption  capability. Moreover,  particle  size  has  an  important  effect
since  it  affects  the  penetration  depth  of  the  MW  as  well  as  the  “skin
effect” whereby electromagnetic energy does not penetrate into the bulk
but concentrates at the catalyst surface only [313]. Microwave-assisted
reforming catalyst design is well reviewed elsewhere [313].

Microwave-assisted DRM offers the opportunity to operate at lower
temperatures and to use heat more efficiently, however it implies much
more complex catalyst design with stability issues. Additionally, scaling
up requires fixing two major problems. First the penetration depth of
MW irradiation into the absorbing material and then the energy con-
sumption required for the MW magnetron.

7.6. Molten metal bubble column reactor

Molten  metal  bubble  column  reactors  have  been  investigated  for
decades for the pyrolysis of methane (eq. 11), allowing the production of
hydrogen  free  from  carbon  oxides  by-products  and  producing  solid
carbon [319]. In this configuration, methane is bubbled at the bottom of
the reactor through the molten liquid. Gas-phase pyrolysis occurs at high
temperature  and  the  low-density  carbon  produced  in  and  around  the
rising gas bubble, floats towards the surface of the melt where it can be
removed.  In  this  way,  carbon  poisoning  is  avoided  and  the  produced
carbon can be separated  in continuous operation  [320]. Palmer et  al.
recently used this concept for DRM, co-feeding various CH4/CO2 ratios
in a molten metal bubble column reactor. They operated the reactor at
◦
C to ensure both DRM and methane pyrolysis
temperatures around 1050
occurred. The metals in the melts were chosen so that one metal must be
able to be oxidised by CO2, CH4 must be able to reduce the formed metal
oxide  and  the  combination  of  metals  should  not form  stable  carbides
under reaction conditions. Additionally, the metal/metal alloy has to be
molten  under  reaction  conditions  [321].  Typically  active  metals  for
DRM are not molten at this temperature hence liquid alloys of active
metals in low–melting-temperature metal “solvents” (Sn, Bi, In, and Ga)
◦
can produce catalysts that melt at < 1000
C [320]. A 65:35 mol% Ni:In
melt was selected and yielded 44% and 81% CH4  and CO2  conversion
respectively when fed with CH4:CO2 = 2:1. The reaction took place via a
redox mechanism, forming and consuming In2O3. CO2 was also found to
react  with  the  carbon  from  methane  pyrolysis  through  the  reverse
Boudouard reaction (reverse of eq. 8) to form CO [321]. Following the
same concept, Yang et al. proposed a liquid alloy-salt catalytic system
which  concept  is  sketched  in  Figure  17.  They  operated  a  two-layer
bubble column reactor composed of a one-end-closed alumina tube fil-
led with a 15 cm Ni0.27Bi0.73 melt followed by 15 cm of a molten K2CO3
salt. The liquid alloy and the molten salt self-segregated into two layers
owing  to density difference and immiscibility. Gases were introduced
through a bubbling tube with a four-pore configuration to create small
bubbles and thereby increase the interfacial area of the bubbles with the
liquid alloy and salt. Unlike In, Bi cannot be oxidised by CO2  thus no
redox mechanism is envisaged. Methane  pyrolysis therefore occurs in
the liquid Ni–Bi alloy producing carbon which floats to the molten salt
layer due to the difference of density and the gas bubbles movement.
Carbon can be trapped at the bubble–alloy interface and rise with the
bubble from the liquid Ni–Bi alloy to the salt [322]. Carbon is thereafter
converted  with  CO2  using  alkali  metal  carbonates  as  catalyst,  taking
oxygen from CO2  and transferring it to carbon to form CO following a
vapor cycle mechanism as described in Figure 17. This system showed
stable performance over 120 h at 1000
C with 35% CH4 and 66% CO2
conversions.  No  carbon  deposition  was  detected  after  reaction,  con-
firming  the  concept,  however  traces  of  K2CO3  diffused  into  the  alloy
[323]. The catalytic properties of potassium carbonate to gasify carbon
are long known [324,325] and K2CO3 was also used to enhance the coke

The use of molten metals for DRM is a very recent advance and leads
the way for future research. The typical drawbacks of thermal catalysis i.
e. sintering and coking are waved, however it still operates at very high
temperatures  (above  1000
C)  thus  offsetting  the  CO2  mitigation  po-
tential of DRM. The stability of molten salts in the presence of water, the
oxidation of the metal alloys and the effect of reaction conditions need
further studying.

7.7. Electrochemical DRM

Recently,  a  couple  of  research  groups  have  attempted  to  perform
DRM  in  an  electrolysis  cell,  following  the  concepts  used  in  CO2  elec-
trolysis and SOFC. During CO2 electrolysis, CO2  molecules in the cath-
ode  are  electrochemically  transformed  into  CO  and  O2(cid:0)
,  while  the
generated  O2(cid:0)
ions  travel  through  the  electrolyte  to  form  O2  at  the
anode  when  a  potential  is  externally  applied.  With  the  objective  to
utilise the O2(cid:0)
formed at the three-phase boundary of the cathode to
oxidise methane into syngas, Qin et al. designed an oxide-ion-conducting
solid oxide electrolyser  using an iron loaded La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ  (LSTO)-
Ce0.8Sm0.2O2δ  (SDC)  cathode,  an  (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ  (LSM)-SDC
anode and a dense Y-stabilised zirconia electrolyte. LSTO is an active
and redox-stable material with high n-type conductivity upon reduction,
which provides good electrode performances. Conversions of CO2 (32%)
and CH4 (78%) were obtained during in situ electrochemical reforming

H2 and 55 % for CO at 800
C. Nickel was found to favour H2 generation
while  copper  catalyst  facilitated  CO  conversion  [328].  Following  the
same concept, Lu et al. designed a solid oxide electrolyser (SOE) where

CO2  electrolysis would happen at the cathode (CO2 + 2e

while  CH4  would  oxidise  at  the  anode  (CH4 + O2(cid:0) = CO + 2H2 + 2e

forming syngas. They used LSCM as both anode and cathode in a sym-
metrical cell. Ni1(cid:0) xCux alloys were incorporated to enhance the catalytic
activity and formed anchored nanoparticles through exsolution. The cell
was stable for 300 h at 800
C under 0.9 V showing coke resistance. The
activity strongly depended on the Ni1(cid:0) xCux  alloy composition and the
optimum synergetic effect was observed for the Ni0.5Cu0.5 composition
[329]. Hirata et al. on the other hand designed a Ni – Gd-Doped Ceria

system  for  DRM.  In  this  configuration  CO2  is  reduced  to  CO  in  the
cathode, then the formed CO and O2(cid:0)
ions are transported to the anode
through the porous GDC film. At the anode, CH4 reacts with the trans-
ported O2(cid:0)
ions to form H2 and CO. The yield of H2 and CO gases was
close  to  100%  at  800
C  however  SrRuO3  decomposed  to Ru  and  SrO
[330]. Here, in order to avoid carbon deposition and blockage, it is key
to prevent CH4  decomposition in the cathode. However, the reforming
reaction proceeds thermodynamically over the metal in the cathode at

C  and  electrochemically  over  the  metals  in  both  electrodes  at

C [331].

To  this day,  the  study  of  dry reforming of  methane in  SOE is  just
starting. This technology depends highly on the ion conductivity of the
electrolyte material which increases with increasing temperature. Such
high  temperatures  offset  the  economic  potential  of  this  technology
compared with thermal DRM.

7.8. Membrane reactor

Catalytic membranes reactors allow to combine reactions and sepa-
ration in one single unit resulting in process intensification. Coupling
reactions  and  separation  also  brings  another  advantage:  improving
conversion  and  selectivity  by  simply overcoming  thermodynamics  re-
strictions shifting the equilibrium when reactants and/or products are
withdrawn from the reaction mixture. For gas phase processes such as
DRM  this  flexible  behaviour  has  inspired  different  approaches,  all  of
them bringing some benefit to the reaction. In particular, O2, H2 and CO2
permeable membranes have been developed at lab scale with direct or
indirect impact on DRM [332]. The vast majority of materials investi-
gated are dense ceramic systems due to the high operating temperatures
required by DRM.

Oxygen  permeable  catalytic  membranes  reactors  are  indeed  fairly
versatile units which can be applied in multiple reactions involving CO2
and CH4  including partial oxidation of methane (POM), oxidative dry
reforming  (ODRM),  oxidative  steam  reforming  (OSMR)  and  oxidative
methane  aromatisation  (OMA)  [333,334].  Figure  18a  showcases  a
schematic image of the oxygen permeable ceramic membrane reactor.
The  advantages  of  this  type of  reactors  are  multiple  but there  are
three key aspects worth mentioning: (i) they prevent reactor fouling and
carbon deposition since oxygen supply helps to gasify solid carbon de-
posits which are one of the major culprits for reforming reactors; (ii) the
presence  of  oxygen  favours  partial  oxidation  and  hence  increases  the
selectivity  towards  CO  as  key  component  of  syngas;  (iii)  the  uniform
oxygen supply across the reactor length permits an excellent tempera-
ture control avoiding hotspots and cold spots which are always detri-
mental  for  the  performance.  The  overall  combination  of  these  effects
leads to an enhanced stability compared to standard packed bed reactors
[336].  The  results  in  Figure  18  corroborate  these  advantages.  A
La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Ni0.2O3(cid:0) δ  hollow  fibre  ceramic  membrane  reactor  re-
ported by Kawi’s team [335] for which the morphology is depicted in
Figure 18b, displays a superior selectivity to H2-rich syngas (Figure 18c)
and greater tolerance to carbon deposition (Figure 18d) due to the ox-
ygen supply in the ODRM compared to a standard DRM.

In view of these advantages, the reader may wonder whether there is
a  real  application  beyond  lab-validated  experiments.  Indeed,  some
commercial ventures has been championed by British Petroleum (BP)
using oxygen permeable MIECs. In the 1980s BP developed a propylene
dimerization membrane reactor and later in the 1990s they launched the
Electropox  process  to  use  catalytic  membrane  reactors  for  POM  and
OSMR [337].

• Carbon dioxide permeable membranes

The urgent need to deal with CO2 emissions has sparked research on
CO2 permeable membranes which can be directly implemented to deal
with flue gases. Membrane technologies for CO2 separation is presented
as  a  cost-efficient  alternative  to  traditional  capture  strategies  using
amines and caustic solvents. Perhaps the main caveat is the stability of
these  membranes  under  realistic  flue  gas  mixtures  at  emission  condi-
tions i.e. high temperatures and containing various impurities including
sulphur  compounds  [338–340].  Generally  speaking,  CO2  permeable
membranes consist of a mixed oxide ion and carbonate ion conductive
(MOCC) dual phase ceramic (O2(cid:0)
conductor)-carbonate composite, such
as  La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3(cid:0) δ
[341],
Sm0.15Ce0.85O1.925  (SDC)–molten  Li/Na/K2CO3,  Bi1.5Y0.3Sm0.2O3(cid:0) δ
(BYS)–molten Li/Na/K2CO3  among other formulations [332]. The CO2
permeation mechanism is represented below, and it is based on the re-
action of oxygen ions with CO2 on the surface of the feed-gas side to form
carbonates which travels through the membrane acting as CO2  carrier
driven by a CO2 partial pressure gradient.

carbonate  membranes  open  multiple  possibilities
to  engineer
advanced reactors [342,343]. Indeed, the high CO2 permeability of this
systems permits the coupling of DRM with the dual phase membranes as
represented in Figure 19b. Herein methane is fed in the tube side which
is packed with a reforming catalyst while CO2 is selectively withdrawn

from a flue gas and enters the reactor from the shell side driven by a
partial pressure difference. This way the intensified reactor synergises
DRM and CO2  separations offering in addition a smart energy integra-
tion strategy by using the heat from to flue gas to drive the endothermic
reforming process.

The concept has been validated at lab scale by Lin and co-workers
who designed a LSCF-molten carbonate membrane coupled with DRM.
An  overall  88%  of  CO2  conversion  was  achieved  with  highly
(cid:0) 1 in the membrane
commendable CO2 permeation flow of 0.17 mL min
side [345]. Hence, although there are still many factors to refine prior a
potential commercial application, it seems that advanced DRM reaction
for  flue  gas  upgrading  can  be  designed  on  the  basis  of  this  process
intensification technology.

• Hydrogen permeable membranes

Hydrogen conducting membranes are also relevant in the context of
reforming  reactions.  Typically,  they  are  based  on  mixed  proton  and
electron conducting ceramic (MPEC) systems and they are suitable for
H2  permeation at high temperatures. In terms of chemical formulation
there the main three groups of MPEC are: (i) SrCeO3 (ii) BaCeO3 and (iii)
defective fluorites [332]. Similarly to the oxygen transport membranes,
the H2 permeation mechanism involves the creation of oxygen vacancies
and the participation of lattice oxygen. Below we showcase the simpli-
fied equations for wet and dry conditions:

A  H2  conducting  membrane  may  be  coupled  to  steam  reforming
where the driven force for the H2  separation is a partial pressure dif-
ference  in  both  sides  of  the  membrane.  Such  a  configuration  is  very
versatile and  permits to tune the  products selectivity. For instance, if
syngas from reforming is aimed to feed a Fischer-Tropsch reactor, then
the  membrane  can  help  to  enrich  or  reduce  H2  concentration  in  the
syngas thus allowing plenty of flexibility in the FT downstream unit. On
the  other  hand,  when  pure  hydrogen  production  is  envisaged  from
reforming, the membrane can actually facilitate a CO-free H2 stream for
its direct use [346].

Biogas  dry  reforming,  and  in  particular  landfill  biogas,  has  been
studied  using  H2-conducting  membranes  to  intensify  the  process.
Parente et al, undertook a very illustrative thermodynamic study using a
multifunctional membrane reactor (MR). The overall concept aimed to
produce  a  H2-rich  upgrading  stream  using  the  combined  DRM-
membrane  approach.  Compared  to  a  standard  DRM  reactor,  the  MR
yields  purer hydrogen  reaching up  to 73.1 mol  of  H2  per  100  mol of
◦
biogas  fed  at  low  reforming  temperatures  (550
C)  with  CO2  recycle

[347]. This is indeed a much greener route to produce H2 compared to
traditional steam reforming resulting in a net reduction of CO2 emissions
and a substantial reduction of the operation cost due to the lower tem-
peratures  needed.  Here  again  membranes  long-term  stability  must  be
validated under representative reforming conditions to further consoli-
date  this  technology  as  a  viable  alternative  for  H2  production  from
biogas sources.

In summary catalytic membranes reactors on its various configura-
tions (i.e. using oxygen, hydrogen or carbon dioxide permeable mem-
branes) represent a creative solution to overcome recurrent limitations
of standard DRM systems such as carbon deposition, limited selectivity,
fine-tune of H2/CO ratio, etc. Despite the technology has been in many
cases validated at lab scale and the overall TRL is around 4-6, limitations
on membranes stability under real flue gas conditions as well as reactors
scalability  still  require  further  investigation.  In  any  case,  catalytic
membrane reactors are deemed as promising configurations which may
play a key role in the future of advanced DRM systems.

8. Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives

Rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions stimulated the establishment of
◦
global  targets  and  local  regulations  to  limit  global  warming  to  2
C.
Reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  energy  production  from  re-
newables and the improvement of energy efficiency are imperative to
reach this target. It is clear that CO2  reforming reactions constitute a
more  sustainable  alternative  to  produce  syngas.  DRM  has  regained
attention  from  the  catalysis  community  due  its  potential  to  utilise
concentrated CO2  sources. In particular, driven by the global need for
renewable  energy,  biogas  plants  treating  various  organic  waste  are
flourishing  and  their  CO2-rich  gas  product  can  readily  be  converted
using DRM. Additionally, flue gas mixtures from heavy carbon industries
are  also  highly  concentrated  in  CO2  and  can  be  considered  for  DRM.
Thermal DRM has the advantage of low-cost implementation since it can
benefit  from  the  already  existing  infrastructure  (e.g.  natural  gas  fur-
naces,  industrial  reformers,  de-sulphurisation  units,  etc.)  in  chemical
plants  like  steel/cement  manufacturing,  ammonia  synthesis  and  re-
fineries among many others. The development of robust catalysts able to
overcome sintering and coking is key to facilitate the implementation of
this technology in commercial units for CO2  recycling applications. In
response to these needs, new engineered catalysts are under develop-
ment using multiple strategies. First, the composition of the catalyst can
be adjusted to hinder coke formation. It is critical to increase the basicity
of the material to allow for rapid carbon oxidation. The use of promoters
allows to adjust the redox properties of the catalyst, the dispersion of the
particles  and  the  oxygen  mobility  if  applied  to  the  support.  The
morphology of the support may also be controlled to satisfy large and
porous  surface  area.  Second,  stabilisation  of  Ni  in  inorganic  complex
structures such as perovskite, pyrochlore, hydrotalcite, hydroxyapatite,

or  hexaaluminate  have  been  proposed  to  yield  small  and  anchored
nanoparticles.  Finally,  layer  confinement  or core-shell/yolk-shell  con-
figurations  are  strategies  that  rely  on  the  physical  isolation  and  pro-
tection  of  particles.  All  of  these  relatively  novel  approaches  show
promising behaviour, but they are still too immature to be considered
realistic alternatives to be implemented in an industrial DRM unit.

Validation of the catalysts under realistic conditions is missing in the
current portfolio of lab-scale studies. There are several pitfalls that need
to be addressed to bridge the gap between lab-scale (TRL 1-3) and pilot
plant  prototype  (TRL  4-6).  For  instance,  catalysts  durability  must  be
assessed for longer period (1000 h and beyond). Most of the academic
papers showcase the apparent stability of their best materials for just
several hours (20 to 50 h) or for few hundred hours in the best cases
(200-500  h).  Rarely  research  papers  consider  longer  term  stability
studies. Although, academic lab-scale studies are limited in budget, time
and  availability,  such  exercises  must  be  conducted.  In  fact,  in  many
cases, the catalysts need a great deal of time to reach the steady state and
what the authors reports as “stability”  is just the time needed for the
catalysts to reach a steady behaviour. Also linked to catalysts durability,
another  frequent  and  unfortunate  pitfall  is  to  evaluate  the  catalysts
stability under equilibrium conditions. The observation of full (or very
high) conversion in durability studies is frequently used mistakenly as
an indicator that a catalyst is stable under reaction conditions. At full
conversion,  only  a  minimum  catalytic  activity  can  be  ascertained,
because the available number of reagents limits conversion. Stability of
catalysts must be analysed at intermediate conversion levels, in kinetic
regime. For plug flow reactors which are the most standard systems for
lab scale testing, this can be achieved by increasing the space velocity.
Along  with  durability,  the  presence  of  impurities  in  the  flue  gas
accompanying CO2  (as for example NOx  and SOx) should be tested to
challenge the robustness of the catalysts. This is in fact one of the biggest
gaps in academic research and very few reports showcase the stability of
a promising CO2  reforming formulation against traces of sulphur. Les-
sons from industrial catalysis should be implemented more frequently in
the  academic  works  to  avoid  frustrations  when  an  apparently
outstanding catalysts loses its excellent performance under real or close
to real conditions. In the same vein, experiments at high pressure should
be more frequently conducted to get a closer picture of the situation in a
pilot prototype or a real CO2 reforming plant. The cost of compression
could hinder the economic viability of the DRM when the reforming unit
is  meant  to  be  integrated  in  an  already  exiting  process.  Herein,  the
combination of process modelling with reaction engineering could help
to shed some lights on the route to pursue when a promising catalyst is
formulated. However, lab scale data are needed, and research groups
should seriously consider running the CO2 reforming reaction at realistic
operating pressures.

In this scenario, further efforts in terms of experimental development
are needed in the near future. The pressure gap, the catalysts life span
validation  and  the  presence  of  impurities  constitute  urgent  gaps  that
must be fulfilled to push forward the catalytic CO2  reforming technol-
ogy.  Alternatively,  new  technologies  have  emerged  to  perform  DRM
beyond its thermodynamic limitations. Thermal DRM is still an energy
intensive process, alternatives have been proposed to reduce its carbon
footprint. Plasma, microwaves and photon energy all allow to perform
the reaction at lower temperatures, decreasing the activation energy of
the reaction. Solar reactors, membrane reactors and induction heating
on  the  other  hand  aim  at  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  process  by
enhancing  heat  transfer,  displacing  the  equilibrium  or  intensifying
capture and utilisation in one unit. Efforts are also emerging to tackle
carbon  deposition  through  reactor  design  with  oxygen  permeable
membranes  or  molten  metal  bubble  reactor.  Although  most  of  these
alternatives just emerged or were applied to DRM in the past 10 years,
they surely open the way to significant breakthroughs resulting in a step
ahead towards a robust CO2 reforming technology that could play vital
role in a low-carbon modern society.
