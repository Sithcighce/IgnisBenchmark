    "question_text": "How do molten salts influence biomass pyrolysis kinetics and carbon structure formation during thermal conversion, and what mechanisms explain the catalytic effects of different metal ions and additives on reaction pathways?",
    "standard_answer": "Molten salts significantly alter biomass pyrolysis kinetics through their high heat transfer capabilities and catalytic properties. The molten salt bath enables higher heating rates during thermal decomposition of organic biomass components, which increases the possibility of obtaining less char yield and more tar fraction (pyrolysis oil). Different metal ions and additives promote distinct pyrolysis reactions through catalytic mechanisms: potassium and sodium ions increase the char yield, while calcium ions only slightly affect char yield. However, other additives such as chlorides, nitrates, and sulfates accelerate levoglucosan generation and therefore decrease the amount of obtained char. The reduction of char yield in molten salt systems is mainly attributed to the further production of C-H and C-O bonds and the aromatization of the carbon by the molten salts during pyrolysis. The salt composition also influences the specific surface area of the resulting carbon, with different salt mixtures producing varying surface areas. The high thermal stability and catalyst characteristics of molten salts represent a new possibility to produce charred materials with optimized properties for energy applications.",

      "1": "In this process, thermal decomposition of organic components in biomass is carried out in a molten salt bath. The higher heating rate in this process increases the possibility of obtaining less char yield and more tar fraction (pyrolysis oil).",
      "2": "Different metal ions promote different pyrolysis reactions. For example, potassium and sodium ions increase the char yield, while it is only slightly affected by calcium ions for the pyrolysis of wood. However, other additives such as chlorides, nitrates, and sulfates accelerate levoglucosan generation and, therefore, decrease the amount of the obtained char."
