Methane (CH4) is now considered a bridge fuel between present fossil (carbon) economy and desired
renewables and this energy molecule is projected to play an important role in the global energy mix well
beyond 2035. The atmospheric warming potential of CH4 is 28–36 times, when averaged over a 100-
year period, that of carbon dioxide (CO2) and this necessitates a close scrutiny of global CH4 emissions
inventory. As the second most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), the annual global CH4 emissions were
645 million metric tons (MMT), accounting for 14.3% of the global anthropogenic GHG emissions. Of this,
five key anthropogenic sources: agriculture, coal, landfills, oil and gas operations and wastewater to-
gether emitted 68% of all CH4 emissions. Landfills are ranked as the third highest anthropogenic CH4 emission
source, behind agriculture and coal mines, and emissions from the waste sector are expected to reach
almost 800 million metric tons CO2 equivalent (MMTCO2e) in 2015.

The two largest economies spewed out 42% (14% (US) and 28% (China)) of the world’s total green-
house gas (GHG) emissions; these two countries are also the largest producers of municipal solid waste
(MSW). The United States averages 250 MMT of MSW annually, of which about 63% enters landfills. In
2015, there were 2434 landfills in the United States and CH4 from these landfills accounted for 138 MMTCO2e
released into the atmosphere and represents 17.7% of all US CH4 emissions. China had 580 landfills and
treated 105 MMT of MSW in 2013. Methane produced from landfills contributes about 13% of total CH4
emissions in China. Almost 50% of landfills in China did not install efficient LFG collection and utiliza-
tion systems to make them manageable so a great deal of CH4 and CO2 are emitted without intervention.
Recent data show that globally, 45 billion cubic meters (bcm) of CH4 or 282 million barrels of oil equiv-
alent (boe) was annually released from landfills into the atmosphere. Managing methane emission from
landfills is a global challenge, though China lags behind in managed landfills that contribute to adverse
health effects on the population. Moreover, the rich organic content of MSW in China indicates that CH4
emissions there may be underestimated. The China unmanaged landfill scenario is further duplicated
in developing as well as in least-developed countries.

This review starts with a dialog on CH4 emissions and climate change and the chemical changes the
CH4 molecule undergoes in the atmosphere (Section 1). Section 2 deals with identification of global CH4
emissions from key sources, particularly anthropogenic, among those are agriculture, coal mines, land-
fills, oil and gas operations and wastewater. Although each of these sources is descriptive on their own,
the focus of Section 3 is on landfills with particular emphasis on the United States and China, two largest
producers of waste. The quantitative measurement of CH4 emissions is still uncertain so Section 4 is devoted
to various CH4 estimation models, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)
LandGEM, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others that are under
development. The key landfill emissions data bases and the collection methodologies such as those used
in the United States and recently released by the Chinese government are highlighted. Section 5 de-
scribes chemistry of pathways that produce CH4 from landfills, and how landfills can control those emissions.
Section 6 reviews potential of CH4 as an energy source for combined heat and power (CHP) production

as well as pathways for conversion of CH4 into renewable gaseous fuel for use as compressed natural
gas (CNG) and clean liquids that could be used as either drop-in replacement (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel
hydrocarbons) or advanced oxygenated fuels such as methanol, a versatile precursor to fuels and chemicals,
and dimethylether (DME), a clean diesel substitute. Section 7 describes in-place government policies to
deal with CH4 emissions from specific sectors. These policies vary from country to country but the Unites
States and the European Union (EU) countries are well ahead in curbing methane emissions while China
is now playing close attention to its increasing global share of emissions. The last section (Section 8)
identifies science and technology and needed policy challenges to manage fugitive methane; this includes
identification of technological intervention that China and other countries would need to capitalize on
this wasted resource by efficiently harvesting this energy source, needed government policies and science
and technology issues that researchers have to deal with to help combat climate change. The overall review
provides a comprehensive description that could lead a coherent picture to harvest global CH4 emissions
for useful energy, a sensible solution.

In 2014, a milestone was reached in US and China relations when the White House announced that
the United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%–28% below
its 2005 level in 2025 while China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and intends
to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. In another
2014 initiative, the United States also identified fugitive methane from oil and gas operations, agricul-
ture, and landfills to maintain respective post-2020 actions on climate change, recognizing that these
actions are part of the longer term efforts to transition to low-carbon economies, mindful of containing
the global temperature increase goal of 2 °C, also known as two-degree scenario (2DS). These commit-
ments by the United States and China were evident in the successful agreement at the culmination of
the recently concluded COP21 event in Paris. This review is written to start a dialog among researchers
that tetrahedral CH4, the simplest among all organic compounds, plays such a complex role in climate
change that as its use increases, it will rival carbon dioxide (CO2) in GHG effect in the coming decades if
no attempt is made to contain its emissions.

Methane (CH4) is the most common organic compound in the
atmosphere [1] and its 2013 globally averaged atmospheric con-
centration was 1824 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), a value that
has been increasing about 0.5% per year over the past 30 years (Fig. 1)
[2]. Current estimates, which tend to converge, are the product of
four independent research communities [3], using flask grab samples
analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization with a pre-
cision of ±2 ppb. Atmospheric concentrations in the Pleistocene Epoch
have varied from 350 ppbv for glaciated periods to 700 ppbv for more
ice-free periods, according to polar cap ice core sample analyses [4].
These modern values are considerably less than the estimated 1–10
parts per million by volume (ppmv) concentrations in the abiotic
Hadean Eon and 100–1000 ppmv in the anoxic Archean Eon [5], al-
though maximum concentrations then may have been 3500 ppmv
[6]. Following the onset of photosynthesis but before complete ox-
ygenation of the atmosphere, concentrations probably were reduced
to 100–300 ppmv [7]. Oxygenation of the atmosphere caused order
of magnitudes reductions in CH4 concentrations. The maximum es-
timated concentration of 750 ppbv for the pre-Industrial Revolution
Pleistocene is elevated a little compared to interglacial averages,
probably because of anthropogenic land use changes over the past
10,000 yrs [8,9]. Methane concentrations over the past 250 years
have increased by approximately 250%, increasing more than carbon
dioxide (CO2) concentrations (which doubled over the same period)
(Fig. 2) [1,4,11].

Fig. 3. Atmospheric decay pathway for methane (adapted from Ref. 12–14).

Atmospheric CH4 decays to CO2 and water (H2O), primarily due
to reactions initiated by the hydroxyl radical (OH·) [11], especially
under strong sunlight in the tropics [4]. The reaction pathway (Fig. 3)
is not simple and involves several feedbacks, and some soluble in-
termediate compounds can be removed by precipitation. The most
important feedback is linked to the OH· reaction pathway (Fig. 4);
atmospheric CH4 tends to consume OH· but the linkages between
compounds that create OH· and the CH4 cycle mean it is not always
the case that the destruction of CH4 requires consumption of OH·
[12]. Still, one reaction pathway for CH4 with OH· results in CO; this
produced CO is then oxidized by more OH·, so one molecule of CH4
results in the consumption of two molecules of OH·. Therefore, as
CH4 concentrations increase, there are somewhat fewer OH· to react
with, thus slowing the destruction of CH4 – a positive feedback where
more CH4 results in a longer CH4 atmospheric lifespan. In this way,
CH4 plays an important role in determining the overall oxidizing ca-
pacity of the atmosphere and its ability to remove many pollutants,
as OH· is involved in many reactions that determine the fate of
common air pollutants [1].

On average, molecules of CH4 have an 8–9 yr atmospheric life
span [4,15] (given as 9.1 yrs in Ref. 11), calculated as the atmo-
spheric content divided by the removal rate. However, because of
feedbacks that slow its removal, the lifespan of CH4 is often given
as its perturbation lifetime. Values for the perturbation lifespan are
usually in the range of 12 yrs [12], with IPCC [11] using 12.4 ± 1.4 yrs,
but may be as much as 14.4 yrs [16]. The OH· is the primary means
of removing CH4 from the atmosphere [11]; one general estimate
found the OH· decay process accounts for 90% of CH4 removals; soil

oxidation by bacteria removes 4% more, stratospheric reactions with
chlorine and oxygen radicals remove 3% more, and chlorine radi-
cals present at the sea–air interface remove the remaining 3% [3].
Because OH· reactions dominate, small changes in its concentra-
tion can cause variability in atmospheric CH4 concentrations [4].
Nonetheless, interannual and interdecadal variability of CH4, while
poorly constrained, is surmised to be due to changes in wetlands
releases [17], and probably driven by precipitation differences [3].
Higher concentrations of CH4 have been measured in the north-
ern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere over the past
1000 years, with the difference increasing from 30–60 ppbv to
150 ppbv in the twentieth century [1]. Seasonal variability at par-
ticular measurement sites appears to be driven by changes in tropical
wetlands releases as mediated by differences in global dispersion
of the released gas [15]. Methane greenhouse gas (GHG) effects are
spatially differentiable from those from CO2, and so these two
gases need to be separately determined in order to model GHG effects
[1].

Methane is a potent GHG; long-wave heat radiation (infrared
light) from the earth’s surface is absorbed by the vibrations of the
carbon–hydrogen bonds of CH4 at wavelengths clustered at 7–13 μm
(wave numbers of 1200–1400 cm−1), with the most important feature
at 7.66 μm (1306 cm−1), preventing radiation from escaping to space
and thereby maintaining the earth’s surface at temperatures above
its “black box” values [1,18]. Methane increases cause increasing GHG

effects with the square root of concentration due to partial satu-
ration [1], although since the wavelengths at which CH4 absorbs
radiation are not entirely saturated each additional molecule of CH4
adds to the GHG effect [19]. Changes in CH4 concentrations corre-
late well with changes in temperature over the past 500,000 years.
It is not clear if temperature changes cause CH4 concentration
changes, or if changes in CH4 concentrations cause temperatures to
change, as the resolution of the signals is not temporally sharp
enough to discriminate [1].

The strength of GHGs is conventionally compared to CO2; this
is because recent increases of the atmosphere’s greenhouse effect
are primarily due to increasing CO2 concentrations. Because the lifes-
pan for CH4 is much less than that of CO2 (CO2 is relatively inert,
and is removed from the atmosphere by coming into equilibrium
with the ocean, a process that requires ~1000 years to complete due
to slow deep water turnover) [20], the CO2-relative GHG impact of
CH4 (sometimes called global warming potential, “GWP”) varies de-
pending on the time horizon that is considered (Table 1). The 100-
year horizon is the most commonly considered value. However,
although the conversion of CH4 to CO2 is already accounted for in
the GWPs, indirect effects associated with its atmospheric decay cycle
can double impacts listed in Table 1 [1]. IPCC [11] distinguishes
between fossil CH4 and general CH4 emissions, as fossil CH4 emis-
sions contribute net “additional” CO2 to the atmosphere on decay.
The sum of CH4 emissions accounts for ~20% of current GHG ra-

diative forcing; CO2 creates about 70% of the forcing, and other gases
account for the difference [11].

Many assessments of non-CO2 GHGs express the amounts of these
GHGs as CO2-equivalents (CO2e) because such units allow for more
direct comparisons of the potential effects associated with the com-
pounds. However, conversion of release amounts or atmospheric
concentrations requires adopting a particular time frame and GWP
value. As Table 1 shows, the standard (IPCC) values have drifted
upwards over several decades for CH4, and some researchers prefer
different values and time scales as appropriate measures of rela-
tive impacts. This suggests that older CO2e values require adjustment
to be considered alongside more recent evaluations; it also implies
use of CO2e units requires explicit identification of the time scale
and conversion factor being used. Note that for CH4 especially, in-
direct effects are usually not included in the valuation factors. Indirect
effects include that oxidation of CH4 causes increases in water vapor,
and its oxidative consumption of OH· results in other GHG gases not
being oxidized in their turn [1].

Based on a “steady-state” atmospheric concentration of 700 ppbv
and a similar-to-present lifespan of CH4 of ~9 yrs, pre-Industrial Age
emissions to the atmosphere were estimated to be on the order of
215 Tg yr−1 [4]. Most current emission estimates range from a little
less than 500 Tg yr−1 to just more than 600 Tg yr−1 (Table 2). Some
estimate the values to be higher – for instance, Kirschke et al. [3]

set their bottom up generation value at 678 Tg yr−1. Models of moni-
tored air concentrations (“inverted” source determinations)
sometimes find large discrepancies from government organization-
reported values [35], although Kirschke et al. [3] presented arguments
that summed bottom-up values resulted in overestimates. To account
for increasing atmospheric concentrations, consumption of CH4 must
be about 0.5% less than the generation estimates. Note that IPCC
in its most recent assessment [11] has adopted values and assess-
ment techniques from Kirschke et al. [3].

Most global estimates of CH4 generation are “bottom up”: they
are based on summing individual source category estimates. Un-
certainties arise due to variability across space and time for point-
source source estimates, which then need to be applied across many
source areas, which also may not be well-defined [1]. Consump-
tion is even more difficult to determine, as measurements of OH·
concentrations are not accurate nor well distributed. Most esti-
mates of consumption use various atmospheric chemistry models.
It is also possible to determine CH4 concentrations from a “top-
down” modeling approach, using the model outputs to assess
variability in monitoring station data, and then fitting presump-
tive sources to those outputs [3].

Methane emissions are usually classified into source catego-
ries. One way is to classify CH4 into biogenic (from microbial
processes), thermogenic (from geologic sources), and pyrogenic (from
incomplete combustion) classes, because each of these has a dif-
ferent stable carbon (δC13) isotopic signature [3] (Table 3). This can
enable verification of estimates based on source categories, by com-
paring measured isotopic values for atmospheric CH4 to modeled
values based on source signatures [3,4]. However, most broad as-
sessments of CH4 generation commonly parse the releases into
different groupings, mostly based on whether the emissions are an-
thropogenic (agriculture, waste management, land use, fossil fuel
industry) or naturally caused (wetlands, termites, seeps) [11,29]. Our
sources assessment (see below) follows this convention, as it is most
amenable to identification of potential mitigation of fugitive releases.
Methane is produced biologically by single-celled organisms in
Archaea, where CH4 is a waste byproduct from metabolic consump-
tion. There are three distinct redox reactions. For the simplest, CO2
is reduced and hydrogen gas (H2) oxidized; energy is produced, water
is created, and CH4 released as a waste gas. The reactions are cata-
lyzed by nickel compounds and are dependent on intracellular thiol
cofactors [36,37]. In detail, complicated organic molecules need to
be simplified before they can be metabolized by methanogens. This
is usually conceptualized as a three-step process. First, organisms
use hydrolysis to convert carbohydrates to simple sugars, proteins
to peptides and amino acids, and lipids to long-chain fatty acids.
Next, other organisms ferment these products either through
acidogenesis to volatile fatty acids, alcohols, ammonia, CO2 and H2,
or through acetogenesis to acetate. The presence of methanogens
often suppresses concentrations of H2 and formate so that other
degradative pathways that are more energetically favorable are not
followed. The class of methanogenic organisms then follows three
distinct pathways to produce CH4. Reductive methanogens convert

38

CO2 and H2 to CH4 and water. The methyl groups in organic com-
pounds associated with acidogenesis pathways are coupled to
coenzyme M and then demethylated, producing CH4 and water with
H2, as was the case for the reduction of CO2. Only a few genera of
aceticlastic methanogens convert acetate to CO2 and CH4 [38].
Methanogens tend to be poisoned by O2 or by reaction products of
O2, and so are considered to be strict anaerobes. Microenviron-
ments may exist in otherwise oxygenated settings to allow
production of CH4 [38]; the mechanisms that allow for oxidative pro-
duction of CH4 from terrestrial plants are not known [39].
Methanogens are found in a variety of anaerobic environments:
waste facilities such as landfills and sewage treatment plants, the
guts of certain primary consumers (notably termites and cattle), rice
paddies, and natural wetlands [11].

Because intermediate reactions catalyzed by other classes of or-
ganisms are necessary for methanogens to use most organic
compounds, it is not likely they were among the first organisms on
early Earth, and they produce less energy per mole of carbon than
any other strand of Archaea, so that they are outcompeted when
other electron donors are not limited [38]. Nonetheless, by the mid-
Archean they are likely to have been important in maintaining the
early atmosphere, partly because atmospheric residence of CH4
would have been closer to 1000 yrs absent oxidizing agents and
would have been key in keeping the early Earth ice-free [5]. Based
on isotopic data, it seems likely that “recent” differences in glaci-
ated and warm-period CH4 concentrations in the Pleistocene are due
to greater wetlands production of CH4 by bacteria when glaciers are
less extensive [4]. Generally, warmer temperatures in the late Ce-
nozoic Era are related to higher CH4 concentrations [40–42], and
positive excursions in CO2 concentrations at other times in this era
also seem likely to have been caused at least partly by increased
CH4 generation, although the source of the CH4 may have been geo-
logic rather than biotic [43].

Wetlands release between 60% [4] and 70% [1] of non-
anthropogenic CH4. Variations in Cenozoic and early Holocene CH4
concentrations have been linked to wetlands expansion and con-
traction [1], and even much of changing concentrations over the past
several millennia appear to be linked to changes in wetland area
although anthropogenic effects on atmospheric concentrations are
detectable [9]. Tundra and higher altitude bogs emit one-third of
wetland CH4 [4], but tropical South America and Africa are the great-
est sources, with large emissions also coming from southeast Asia
and temperate South America [3]. This creates latitudinal and sea-
sonal signals in emissions [3,44]. The saturated soils of wetlands,
which typically have high carbon loading and slow water circula-
tion, tend to be anoxic. This supports anaerobic decay of organic
matter. Where redox conditions allow, methanogenesis occurs. The
wetland water interface may be a region of intense CH4 oxidation,
but often more CH4 is produced than can be consumed. Modern ag-
riculture is usually assessed as being the greatest single source of
CH4 [44], but wetlands are the second largest single source. Changes
in rainfall in tropical South America and/or Africa have consequen-
tial impacts on wetland release rates, and therefore these climatic
conditions dominate interannual variability in atmospheric CH4 con-
centrations [3,11].

In the mid-2000s there was flurry of excitement regarding an
unexpected source term for CH4. Frankenberg et al. [45] identified
high emission levels from tropical forests through space-based ob-
servations. The amounts (30 Tg yr−1) were within model budget
uncertainties (50–100 Tg yr−1). Incubation experiments in the field
and laboratory suggested that some unidentified methanogenetic
process in forests could cause CH4 releases from live plants as well
as fallen litter. Field experiments were partly confounded by the un-
avoidable presence of atmospheric CH4, but laboratory work in CH4-
free settings suggested aerobic methanogenesis was occurring, and
because of the depleted δC13 signatures of the resulting gases, pectin

was probably the plant material being consumed. Global emis-
sions were estimated to be 62–236 Tg yr−1, with approximately 10%
from litter and the remainder coming from living tissues [46]. The
deviation in δC13 values was seen as validating excursions mea-
sured in ice cores in pre-Industrial times [47]. The large potential
output was quickly reduced: to less than 125 Tg yr−1 through three
independent CH4 budget modeling exercises [48], to 20–69 Tg yr−1
by reconsidering assumptions made in the original global output
estimate [49], and to potentially as low as 0 Tg yr−1 through recon-
sideration of ice core δC13 values (although uncertainties associated
with biomass combustion mean that substantial emissions of more
than 100 Tg yr−1 were still considered possible) [50]. Confirmatory
experiments sometimes found emissions, and sometimes did not,
although a consensus seems to be that woody plant pectins under
UV-light could produce CH4 through an undetermined mecha-
nism [39]. Lichens and bryophytes [51] and wheat farming [52] have
been found to cause some methane emissions, too, although one
study suggested aerobic agricultural soils are a net sink and not a
source of CH4 [53]. Recent global budgets do not include aerobic
methanogenesis from terrestrial plants as a substantial source of
atmospheric CH4 (see Refs. 11 and 3) and IPCC [11] described it to
be “unlikely” to be a significant contributor. Linked to this is the
“ocean methane paradox,” where the surface ocean is saturated with
both CH4 and O2; most budgets estimate the oceanic contribution
to atmospheric methane at 5–25 Tg yr−1. Research suggested that
at least some of these releases were from methylphosphonate de-
composition to generate phosphate (under low phosphorus
conditions) in the surface ocean saturated in O2 [54]. In addition,
thawing permafrost, because the carbon made available in this
process is likely to be under anaerobic conditions, is expected to
be a potentially large CH4 source in the near future, although it is
not a significant element in current CH4 budgets [55].

Submarine seeps and mud volcanoes are the largest geologic point
sources of CH4 [56]. A great deal of ocean sediment-sourced CH4
is oxidized before it reaches the open ocean [57]. Some abiotic CH4
is also produced by volcanic outgassing. Spreading ridges create ser-
pentine rocks, which tend to exclude ferrous minerals. Serpentine
oxidizes to magnetite, which leads to the reduction of CO2 to CH4
[5,58]. Other CH4 classed as abiotic production occurs with the burial
of organic carbon fixed by autotrophs, which is then diagentically
released as CH4 either as direct gas seeping to the atmosphere or
through volcanic releases [37]. Release of CH4 from oceanic hy-
drates can also be perceived of as an abiotic CH4 release [43],
although it is likely most CH4 in hydrates was originally produced
through methanogenetic organisms. Thermogenesis typically results
in much higher ethane and propane to CH4 ratios than biotic
methanogenesis, and δC13 values are smaller [38].

Fossil fuels are a source of CH4. Fossil fuels too are diageneti-
cally altered organic carbons, present as solids (coal), liquids
(petroleum), or gas (natural gas). Methane is a component in all of
these carbon states, and is a byproduct release associated with the
harvest, transport, and use of these resources [1,11,22]. Natural fossil
fuel sources include diffuse but widespread microseepage from
petroleum-containing sedimentary basins [56]. Incomplete com-
bustion of wood, fossil fuels, and other carbon-containing materials
is also a source of CH4 [1,3,11].

Release of CH4 to the atmosphere from many environments can
be inhibited and greatly reduced because of methane oxidizers. This
is especially true in sedimentary environments [38]. Methane oxi-
dizing bacteria will be discussed thoroughly in Section 4.

2. Methane emissions from key anthropogenic sources

This section describes CH4 emissions to the atmosphere from four
key anthropogenic sources: agriculture, coal mines, gas systems (in-
cluding other petroleum system sources), and wastewater

management. Landfills are discussed separately and more com-
pletely in Sections 3–5. These five sources are the dominant
anthropogenic sources (Table 4) and so offer opportunities for control
of CH4 impacts regarding climate change. Table 5 lists natural sources
of methane. There is variability in the assessment of sources. Part
of the differences comes from definitional issues (such as whether
wildfires are considered separately from biomass combustion for
energy purposes), but most of the differences come from the use
of models primarily based on area emission rates. All but one current
assessment find that most CH4 releases have anthropogenic sources,
with circa two-thirds of all CH4 is now released because of human
activities; this ignores secondary effects associated with climate
change, such as increased forest fires [61] and termite activity [62].
Although short-term variations in CH4 concentrations are most prob-
ably due to climatic effects on wetlands, the overall trend of
increasing CH4 concentrations is being driven by human-caused re-
leases to the atmosphere [3,11,17].

IPCC [10] notes that assessments of CH4 sources are more un-
certain than assessments of CO2 sources. Kirschke et al. [3] estimated
that uncertainties in CH4 quantifications are being reduced, but are
still substantial: 50% for wetlands and perhaps 100% for other natural
sources; 60% for biomass burning, and 30% for waste, fossil fuel, and
agriculture anthropogenic source terms. Brandt et al. [63] esti-
mated that emissions as estimated by the US Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) in its inventory reports are at least 50%
too low in sum, and that errors are greater for certain source cat-
egories (as surmised from isotopic analyses). In addition to scaling
issues discussed above, errors accumulate because samples are not
representative of sources (i.e., whether or not fracking effects are
not accurately accounted for), samples are too few in number, may
be biased because of selection of cooperative sites, data uncertain-
ty is not properly accounted for, and distributions of sources are likely

to have “heavy tails,” which, when coupled with insufficient sam-
pling, means large sources are not well represented in the data sets.

2.1. Select anthropogenic methane sources

Agriculture is usually assessed as the largest category of anthro-
pogenic CH4 releases, and the single largest source of CH4 to the
atmosphere. The predominant sources have long been under-
stood to be rice paddies and livestock (either from manure or rumen
releases, or both) [64–66], and that is still the current understand-
ing [11]. Rice cultivation is a much smaller source than livestock,
with estimates for rice cultivation about 40 Tg yr−1 and ruminants
approximately double [4,11].

Agricultural lands cover approximately 50% of the global land
surface, and because of population growth, agricultural effort and
outputs have been increasing. Flooded tropical rice paddies create
near optimal conditions for CH4 production: low redox condi-
tions, large labile organic inputs, and elevated temperatures, all of
which are found just below the water–soil interface [67]. Methane
is released at specific times in the rice cultivation process, meaning
it is not a constant source even when cultivated year round [68].
Flooding is the key element, as it creates the anoxic conditions nec-
essary for methanogenesis [67]. A rough approximation of average
rice paddy CH4 emission rates is 300–500 mg m−2 d−1 [64]. The
amount of CH4 produced in rice paddies is actually ten times greater
than what is emitted; 90% of production is consumed by
methanotropic bacteria at the sediment–water interface and in the
water column of a flooded paddy [12].

Increasing incomes lead to less consumption of starchy food and
more consumption of meats, dairy, and fish [69]. IPCC [10] reports
that changes in diet could increase non-CO2 emissions from agri-
culture by a factor of 3. Because modern diets include more meat,

ruminant numbers have increased more than human population has.
Grazing systems now occupy 30% of ice-free land surface [70]. Ru-
minants (primarily cattle but also sheep and goats) harbor bacteria
in their digestive system that aid in the degradation of fodder; the
animals absorb organic compounds released as breakdown prod-
ucts from the bacteria, but the bacteria also produce CH4, ammonia,
and CO2 as waste gases, which the animals emit [12].

Methane (and CO2) are incorporated in coal deposits, and there-
fore can escape to the atmosphere when coal is mined [71]; the
methane is released directly from coal, and also from nearby strata,
because more CH4 is generated during coalification than can be
stored in the coal seams themselves. Mining disturbance of the sur-
rounding rocks and coal seams releases the gas from its storage. In
open pit mines, the CH4 escapes directly to the atmosphere, but in
underground mines the gas seeks means to escape, including shafts
and tunnels, although to maintain safety for miners concentra-
tions in these areas are actively sought to be minimized. Because
open pit mines usually exploit younger and shallower coal seams,
it is thought that they hold less CH4 per ton of removed coal, and
it is also assumed that the overlying strata are not significant sources
of gas [72]. Gas is intentionally ventilated from underground mines
for safety reasons, and CH4 evolves from stored coal [73].

Estimates of coal mine CH4 releases amount to between 8% and
12% of all anthropogenic CH4 in the atmosphere [11,72,74]. The great-
est producers of coal (China, US, India, Russia) also emit the most
CH4, although the use of horizontal and vertical wells to recover coal
gas from coal seams and surrounding rocks (respectively) is in-
creasing, especially in the US and China [74,75]. Coal mining was
estimated to produce about 25% of all US anthropogenic releases
[26].

Methane is the primary constituent of natural gas (they are some-
times considered to be synonymous); thus it is not surprising that
natural gas (its mining, processing, shipment, and use) should result
in fugitive CH4. Methane is also one of the volatile hydrocarbons
released from petroleum, and natural gas is often co-located with
petroleum. Therefore it is also released in the mining, processing,
transport, and use of petroleum, although the scale of those re-
leases is much smaller than releases associated with natural gas
operations. In the US, oil operations release only one-quarter as much
CH4 as natural gas systems [26].

“Conventional” estimates of fugitive gas releases are less than
2% of natural gas production [1,76]; some studies find potential re-
leases from conventional well head sites may be as much as 6%, and
for fracking the upper end estimate was nearly 8% of produced gas
[22]. Pneumatic devices (55–150 fittings or so per well) and storage
facilities are the major sites for releases [22,77]; gas transporta-
tion, because of compressors and pneumatic devices, and
compressors at processors are also leak sites [77]. Increases in
fracking for both oil and gas may increase production losses, because
of estimates that fracking has two orders of magnitude greater re-
leases in the drilling phase [22]; USEPA [26] found that fracking had
increased overall industry-wide production emissions by 25%; con-
trariwise, the large sampling effort reported by Allen et al. [78] found
flow-back releases of CH4 to be much lower than USEPA [26]
estimates.

Methane is produced in the processing of human sanitary wastes
(generally, wastewater) when anaerobic conditions exist [79]. This
can be deliberately induced or be the result of happenstance, or may
be due to error. Most large sewage treatment plants operate aero-
bically to treat inputs, which should not result in methanogenesis.
Some systems, particularly anaerobic lagoons and constructed wet-
lands, intentionally use anaerobic consumption of organic matter
as a primary treatment process, causing CH4 emissions. On-site san-
itary systems for houses (cesspools and septic systems) tend to
operate anaerobically and so produce CH4. Latrines also decay wastes
anaerobically [26]. Wastewater facilities often anaerobically digest

sludge to reduce its mass, make dewatering easier, and decrease its
odor potential [80].

Wastewater is a relatively insignificant source of fugitive CH4 in
the US, estimated at less than 3% of all anthropogenic releases [26];
this is less than the 5–10% worldwide estimates reported in Table 4.
Three-quarters of CH4 releases from sewage treatment plants is from
digesters, and better operation of ventilation systems can reduce
off-gassing [81]. Anaerobic digestion (AD) can manage other ma-
terials than sewage sludges, including, animal wastes, crop residues,
aquatic and marine biomass, MSW, food wastes, and various in-
dustrial effluents (wood and paper pulp, food processing wastes,
even textile effluents and petrochemical plant residues) [82–84].
A consortium of microbes working in concert degrades complex
organic molecules to CH4 (and either CO2 or water) [84], a process
which involves several distinct stages [85].

The Buswell formula (Equation (1)) is also applied to calculate
the maximum amount of methane may be generated during AD
process [86].

Because excess produced H2 is available to reduce CO2, the “the-
oretical” 50:50 ratio of CH4 to CO2 is rarely observed; CH4 content
in produced biogas is usually greater than CO2 and ranges from 40
to 70% [84]. Anaerobic digestion is not very efficient, however, and
typically only 20–30% of infeed organic matter is mineralized,
because of the large amount of lignin in typical AD feedstocks [87].
Lignin itself is recalcitrant, and also inhibits the digestion of more
degradable cellulose compounds [88].

Various inhibitory or toxic substances are the primary cause of
AD reactor upset; many are common elements of MSW and other
wastes [83,89]. Competition between sulfur reducing bacteria and
methanogens can occur, resulting in biogas contamination with H2S
[83]; typical H2S concentrations from manures and sewage sludges
are 200–1500 ppm, with some reports of concentrations as much
as 10,000 ppm [80].

2.2. Prevention and control of anthropogenic methane emissions

Methane releases from rice paddies have decreased per tonne
of rice produced, due to greater yields and more use of inorganic
fertilizers [30,90]; inorganic fertilizers may reduce CH4 releases by
a third [67]; using fertilizers with greater amounts of sulfur can
promote competition with sulfate-reducing bacteria, potentially re-
ducing CH4 emissions [91]. Draining flooded fields at some time
during the year also reduces gas emissions [1], and removal of rice
straw after harvest can also decrease CH4 production in paddies [92].
Increasing use of composts and other humified carbon sources may
be useful to maintain good soil qualities; they should produce less
CH4 emissions than traditional “green” manures [67]. Higher quality
feed decreases both rumen releases and manure production slightly
(approximately 5%) [93], mostly by reducing rumen pH [92], but ap-
proximately 50% of ruminants graze on lower quality feed on
grasslands [70]. Dietary additives, especially fats, appear to reduce
CH4 generation, and so can diet supplements of yeasts. Rumen mi-
crobial populations can be manipulated through vaccination or
antibiotic applications, although this may reduce weight gain or milk
production. Animals can be bred to produce less CH4, but this is likely
to lead to unwanted production reductions, too [94].

Coal-sourced CH4 is declining (absolutely and relatively) for two
reasons: increased use of controls to reduce releases, and declin-
ing use of coal as an energy source as it is replaced by natural gas
[75]. The most efficient use of coalbed CH4 occurs when it is cap-
tured at a source; otherwise, if ventilation gas is the target, the
concentrations of CH4 are likely to be too low to support commer-

cial exploitation. Medium Btu gas can be collected in gob areas
immediately before coal removal, but higher Btu gas can be col-
lected directly from the seam prior to the shaft reaching this coal
[95]. Gas collection from seams can be passive, or can occur under
suction; gas must be actively removed from the gob area [96]. Ven-
tilation gas is typically catalytically oxidized to CO2 if it is not released
directly to the atmosphere [95]. Reductions in coalbed CH4 re-
leases not only decrease CH4 emissions and therefore help the
environment, they provide an opportunity for energy recovery, and
increase miner safety [75].

Natural gas releases to the atmosphere are obviously reduced
if gas is flared rather than let out into the atmosphere. Reductions
from extraction, transportation, and processing activities are mostly
the result of tighter fittings, use of better kinds of seals, and more
active maintenance of infrastructure [95,97]. In the US, high emis-
sions sites (estimated to be 0.05% of all wells) are the source of over
50% of the total leakage [63], so that targeted efforts can bear great
dividends.

3. Methane emissions from landfills

Landfills release CH4 to the atmosphere because much of the
waste buried in them is organic. Biological degradation of the organic
matter consumes interstitial O2, and the waste pile becomes an-
aerobic. When redox conditions support methanogenesis, CH4 is
released as a waste gas [98]. Although landfill surfaces are some-
times sealed from the environment in developed countries, and
landfill surface soils may host methanotropes, some CH4 is re-
leased to the atmosphere. Global releases, as determined through
inventories of all methane sources, appear to be on the order of 40–
75 Tg yr−1 (Table 4). One sectoral-specific determination, at 54 Tg yr−1
[99], is in agreement, but another finds lower emissions at 30–
35 Tg yr−1 [100]. Reports are also spatially variable; as of the mid-
2000s, for instance, field measurements showed release rates from
sanitary landfills ranged over seven orders of magnitude, from
0.0004 g m−2 d−1 [101] to >10,000 g m2 d−1 [102]. Negative methane
release values (where landfill soils consume atmospheric CH4) are
also possible (see Refs. 103–105]; implied from Ref. 12).

Not all generated landfill methane is emitted into the air; some
is stored in the landfill in voids and part is oxidized to CO2 by mi-
crobes in landfill soils. Variations in stored CH4 were found to be
considerable, resulting from variable leachate levels, changes in in-
ternal geometries, dissolution into and out of leachate, changes in
gas extraction rates, and relative changes in atmospheric pres-
sures and temperatures [102].

Since CH4 releases in solid waste management are generated
almost entirely by landfills, and landfills are the dominant means
of waste disposal worldwide, CH4 generation should correlate to
waste generation rates [99,100]. IPCC collects country-specific data
for greenhouse gas releases, including reports on landfill emis-
sions, and requests annual updates. Instructions to produce the
reports were released in 1994 and revised first in 1996 [106] and
again in 2001 [107]. USEPA, which generates comprehensive world
estimates of GHG releases, uses the IPCC data as a starting point;
USEPA uses other data sets to adjust IPCC values, and to deter-
mine data where none were reported to IPCC [25]. Many reporting
countries assume gas generation is proportional to waste genera-
tion, and use some conversion factor to transform whatever waste
data may be available to a CH4 release value [108]. The IPCC esti-
mation uses Equation (2) [109]:

Me = methane emitted (Tg yr−1)
MSWt = total MSW generated (Tg yr−1)
MSWf = fraction of MSW landfilled in an engineered landfill
DOC = fraction of biodegradable organic carbon in MSW
DOCf = fraction of organic carbon converted to CH4 or CO2
F = fraction of CH4 in landfill gas
R = recovered CH4 (Tg yr−1)
OXf = fraction of CH4 oxidized at the landfill

However, differences in waste management processes mean that
is a too simplistic conceptualization to be useful to generate mean-
ingful national and regional CH4 generation and release rates.
Alternatives to landfilling of wastes are common: recycling diverts
waste, both by organized programs in developed countries, and
through more informal sectors in the developing worlds. Waste may
not be collected for management in some areas. Collected wastes
may be dumped in unofficial disposal sites, or at unengineered dis-
posal points (dumps) [110]. Sanitary landfills (engineered structures
intended to mitigate some environmental impacts of landfilling) may
or may not collect gases produced in the fill. Dumps, depending on
climate, thickness of waste deposits, quality of materials, and
whether or not they have been set on fire to control odors and
vermin, might or might not produce gas [99,111]. Kirschke et al. [3]
characterized uncertainties associated with landfill CH4 genera-
tion rates at about 30%. IPCC estimates for worldwide releases, using
two alternative estimation means, also narrowed the gap between
them to 30% for 2005 [108]. There is some skepticism regarding the
accuracy of these kinds of data, however [63]; the latest IPCC report
[10] notes that the poor quality of waste data affects the value of
GHG estimates derived from them.

Table 6 shows estimates of CH4 releases from landfills world-
wide, by various regional definitions, using some of the more
comprehensive global accountings. The values in Table 6 are less than
many of the broader sectoral estimates presented in Table 4. This
may partially stem from more specific assessments accounting for
mitigation of methane generation better, or from rounding errors
in assessments with larger scopes.

As mentioned, IPCC has required member nations to estimate
CH4 releases under various source categories through annual re-
porting. For landfills, IPCC has created an estimation methodology
that depends on data for landfilled wastes over time (because land-
fills emit CH4 from buried wastes over decades). IPCC inventories
show that landfills are approximately 2% of worldwide emissions.
Approximately 4%–5% of CH4 releases from developing countries
come from landfills, although per capita landfill CH4 emission rates
tend to be much lower (because much smaller amounts of wastes
are managed through landfills) [33]. Transition from unmanaged
wastes to a modern waste management system can increase CH4
emissions by a factor of 5 [60]. Releases of CH4 from the most de-
veloped countries are declining on a per capita basis due to growing
controls on landfill releases, and, for some EU countries, are de-
clining absolutely due to compliance with the EU Landfilling Directive
(see Section 7, below).

The data in Table 6 generally show increasing releases in all areas
of the world, and so the world summaries show ~10% increase from
1990–2010. This is twice as great as the atmospheric increase over
the same time period. The one area of the world with decreasing
landfill CH4 releases is Europe. The European Union has passed leg-
islation (see Section 7) reducing the delivery of organic wastes to
landfills. As shown just below in Section 3.3, some of the de-
creases for particular member states are very dramatic.

specified by IPCC (in 2006). The model estimates CH4 generation
based on waste inputs. USEPA modified the model to match results
from a survey of 52 US landfills, which were found to be affected
by rainfall. Therefore US landfills were stratified into three climate
categories (high rainfall, medium rainfall, low rainfall), with CH4 gen-
eration rates dependent on the climate and waste inputs. The total
amount of CH4 generated was reduced by data specifying gas com-
busted to produce energy or flared prior to release, with a 10%
reduction additionally applied to account for methanotrope con-
sumption of CH4 at the landfill–atmosphere interface [27]. The data
are also affected across the reports by changes in USEPA modeling
of solid waste generation. USEPA adjusts previous years’ estimates
when it alters the overall model, and so part of the changes in the
data has to do with the changes in waste generation created by waste
model alterations.

An independent estimate of total landfill gas (LFG) production
based on summing reports from individual landfills estimated that
9 Tg yr−1 were generated. This is 50% greater than the 2012 USEPA
estimate of 6 Tg yr−1, which was based on the BioCycle estimate of
US waste generation, and nearly twice as large as the USEPA esti-
mates based on the USEPA waste generation model. According to
this paper, more gas was used for beneficial purposes (39%) than
was flared (27%), but 34% of the available gas was emitted to the
atmosphere (even allowing for CH4 oxidation in cover soils) [115].

US landfill CH4 emission estimates are presented in Table 7.
The data in Table 7 show that more recent model outputs tend
to report fewer releases, comparing year to year. However, the models
also tend to show decreasing releases over time. This is not only
due to changes in landfilling rates, but also because more gas is being
captured and flared, or used to produce a form of energy. There is
not great confidence in USEPA waste generation estimates (see Refs.
124 and 125; the nearly 100% difference between government and
independent estimates for 2012 underscores how larger esti-
mates of waste generation lead to much larger estimates of US
landfill emissions. This difference in the estimates is nearly 1% of
total world CH4 emissions.

3.2. China landfill emissions

China waste management numbers are uncertain. In 2006, it was
estimated that annual per capita waste generation in urban areas
was a little over 500 kg [126]. One evaluation used those values to
suggest urban waste generation was ~340 MT, and about two-
thirds was collected [127]. The official collection rate (“harmless
treatment”) for 2010 was 77.9%. Suburbs and exurbs of the cities
usually have little to no collection. Amounts of wastes are growing
nearly 6% a year: partly due to increasing per capita generation, but
partly due to increased collection efforts [128]. With recycling rates

less than 5%, and incineration estimated at 15% in 2010, nearly all
(~80%) managed urban waste was landfilled [127].

Rural waste is different in quantity and quality. Waste genera-
tion is about 400 kg person−1 yr−1. There are low collection rates
(~25%). Rural areas have lower incineration rates, and less recy-
cling, so that about 90% of the managed wastes are landfilled [127].
This suggests urban per capita landfilling rates are ~300 kg, and rural
per capita rates are somewhat less than 100 kg. Most of the re-
maining waste is dumped, either informally as a form of litter or
in unregulated sites [127].

Waste generation is not only different on an urban–rural axis,
but according to geography. Waste composition in the north of China
is very different from that in the south, not only due to differences
in food consumption, but also because of domestic use of coal. Coal
ash can comprise up to 70% of northern MSW at times in winter,
although substitution for other fuels (predominantly natural gas)
is leading to rapid change [128].

Cai et al. [129] found about 75% of “safely disposed” MSW was
landfilled in China in 2012. The number of sanitary landfills has de-
creased from a peak value in 2001, but the tonnage of waste
landfilled has steadily increased. A scoring system established by
the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Construction classifies the
nation’s landfills: scores greater than 85 is Class I and between 70
and 85 is Class II, with 190 out of 365 landfills rated as Class I or II
in 2005, with 300 landfills reaching Class I or II in 2008 [130].

It is not clear what source for MSW generation data was used
to drive the gas release models, but it appears it was the same for
all of the US-generated reports, and is likely to be the official gov-
ernment estimate of waste generation. One independent assessment
used data from 2007, with site-specific waste generation and cli-
matic information used to drive a FOD model (see Section 4), with
different degradation rates for a number of organic waste frac-
tions. The work divided China into seven regions to differentiate
waste composition. Three different classes of landfills were iden-
tified based on tonnages managed, and data from 2107 landfills were
used (630 sanitary landfills, 1477 “simple” landfills). The model pre-
dicted 1.186 Tg CH4 emissions [129].

China landfill CH4 emissions data are presented in Table 8. The
data show slowly increasing emissions, with the rate of increase
about 5% decade−1.

3.3. Other key countries landfill emissions

In India, MSW “generation” data were said to be 6 MT in 1947,
and 48 MT in 1997 [131], with 0.5–0.7 kg person−1 d−1 generated in
urban areas [132]. These data most probably refer to the amount
of managed MSW; data from Rathje’s work with Mexico City house-
holds in the 1980s suggest less developed countries generate
approximately the same amount of MSW as developed countries
(2–3 kg HH−1 d−1), although the composition is very different [133],
and it is clear many developing countries do not have any orga-
nized means to manage the generated wastes. IEA [134] set India
urban waste generation at 42 MT, and said 50–90% is sent to un-
controlled dumps with the remainder left as litter or sent to
absolutely uncontrolled sites. Sampling of urban wastes find they
contain a high level of putrescible material, largely food wastes,
which means when collection is provided it must be frequent – as

often as every day. However, street sweepings and construction and
demolition debris in wastes mean that much of landfilled waste is
inert (20–45%). Most recyclable material is scavenged before dis-
posal (or at the disposal site, before burial) [135].

Tremendous rates of recycling are achieved through the infor-
mal sector; there is little to no source separation. Most wastes are
disposed of as litter or at informal dumps. Composting is also widely
practiced, but the end product is often low quality due to physical
contaminants (plastics, glass, metal) in the feedstock [135]. Jha et
al. [132] cited reports that 70–90% of India’s landfills, managing
three-quarters of its waste, were “non-scientifically managed ... open
dumpsites.” Local funding is used for municipal waste manage-
ment, and obtaining capital for large projects is considered to be
difficult [135].

Application of the earliest IPCC methodology, which assumed all
CH4 was emitted in one year of waste deposition, resulted in an initial
nationwide landfill emission rate of 0.334 Tg yr−1 for 1990–1991, and,
using revised data, an increasing rate of 0.263 Tg yr−1 (1980) to
0.502 Tg yr−1 (1999). A revised, “triangular” approach (a linear ap-
proximation of the FOD methods) estimated release rates of 0.119–
0.4 Tg yr−1 over the same period [136]. Estimates by others of CH4
generation around 2000 ranged from 0.33 to 1.80 Tg yr−1, plus an
unknown amount from “open dumping and improper landfilling”
[131]. Joseph [135] suggested that releases nationwide range from
0.5 to 1.5 Tg yr−1. A comparison of integrated fluxes based on field
measurements at open dumpsites to IPCC modeling estimates for
the sites found the IPCC methodology outputs were at least two
orders of magnitude greater [132].

The other countries reviewed here (Table 9) were selected to
provide a diversity of data sets. Indonesia, for instance, has a much
smaller population than India (by a factor of 5), and is develop-
mentally similar. Nonetheless, reported emissions are much greater
than India emission rates. South Africa is also a developing country.
Its emissions on a per capita basis far exceed Indonesia’s. Brazil and
Mexico are similar developmentally, but Mexico has 40% fewer
people. Mexico’s landfill emissions are twice as great as Brazil’s, and
sometimes were found to be greater than Russia’s – a country that
is much more developed and has a somewhat greater population.
In 1990, Germany’s landfill emissions were on a par with Russia’s.
Now Germany emits a tenth of what Russia landfills do. This is due
to aggressive implementation of the EU Landfill Directive in Germany,
which aims to divert degradable organic wastes from landfills. On

the whole, the table shows increasing CH4 emissions from land-
fills (with the notable exception of Germany) – a trend that makes
intuitive sense, given increasing populations in these countries and
also generally increasing affluence, and perhaps improving methods
of waste management. However, the disparities in the compara-
tive generation rates make it seem likely that the same estimation
processes are not being applied evenly among these different
states.

4. Methane emission estimation models

LFG modeling is the practice of forecasting gas generation, emis-
sions, and recovery based on past and future waste disposal histories
and estimates of collection system efficiency [138]. Modeling is relied
upon due to complexities and uncertainties associated with methane
production (methanogenesis), consumption (methanotrophic oxi-
dation) and LFG transport processes. The balance between
production, consumption and transport processes results in field
measurements of landfill methane emissions that range over seven
orders of magnitude (less than 0.0004 g m−2 d−1 [101] to more than
10,000 g m−2 d−1 [102]). Site precipitation, preferential flow paths
within the waste mass, the distribution of methanotropes in cover
soils, and underlying waste quality and history all affect measure-
ments at a particular place at a landfill. Barometric pressure has also
been identified as a key environmental control on measurements
of release rates [139]. Although approaches to integrate areal site
releases are available (see Section 4.4), the most common means
to estimate a site’s gas emissions is through a model [125]. There-
fore, the quantification of methane generation and emission rates
for a given field site requires a reliable model which considers spatial
and temporal variability of waste inputs and local conditions.

Mathematical models have been designed to simulate bio-
chemical and physical processes governing the microbial degradation
of organic material and the subsequent generation and transport
of LFG, and the emission of LFG from landfill surfaces [138,140].
USEPA and IPCC have developed the most widely applied method-
ologies for determining methane generation, and provided default
values for model input parameters for sites and areas lacking spe-
cific input data. Model results do not always match well with real
world results. For instance, Terraza and Willumsen [141] estimate
gas collection projects underperform by 20–90% compared to ex-
pected values based on standard models.

4.1. USEPA model (LandGEM)

The Landfill Gas Emission Model (LandGEM) is an automated es-
timation model with a Microsoft Excel interface used to calculate
CH4 and non-methane organic compound (NMOC) emission rates
from MSW landfills. LandGEM relies on a FOD approach for quan-
tifying emissions from the decomposition of MSW. The model is
simple and flexible. LandGEM is thought to be most accurate when
site-specific climatological and waste disposal data are available, but
has default values based on the country the model version is de-
signed for. The base model was developed for US sanitary landfills.
LandGEM 3.02 was released in 2005 [142]. It is based on a simpler
model, the Scholl Canyon model developed by Emcon Engineering
in 1976, which used an exponential decay equation to estimate gas
generation over time [141].

LandGEM uses Equation (3) to simulate emissions, using a 0.1 year
time increment; the model assumes CH4 generation is at its peak
shortly after initial waste placement (after a short time lag while
anaerobic conditions are established). The model also assumes that
the rate of CH4 generation decreases exponentially as organic ma-
terial is consumed by bacteria [142] (also see Section 5).

j = 0.1 year time increment,
k = methane generation rate (year−1)
L0 = potential methane generation capacity (m3 Mg−1)
Mi = mass of waste accepted in the ith year (Mg)
tij = age of the jth section of waste mass Mi accepted in the ith
year

The value k, the degradation rate constant, is key to accounting
for different conditions at different sites, or for area consider-
ations. It determines how quickly mass is converted to CH4 [143].
Higher values of k result in higher initial CH4 generation amounts,
which then decline more quickly as the waste mass ages. The default
value for k is 0.04 yr−1. Values of k used at US landfills range from
0.003 yr−1 (for landfills in arid regions) to 0.70 yr−1 (for wet bioreactor
landfills); the typical input value is 0.05 yr−1 [144]. The factors af-
fecting k that are either easily measurable or approximated are
precipitation, temperature, biodegradable fraction of the waste, and
the depth of the landfill. LandGEM models applied at 32 North Amer-
ican landfills were tuned using fuzzy logic, resulting in somewhat
consistent predictions compared to estimated gas generation
(r2 = 0.791, with predictions tending to underestimate output (Δ
ranging from −18% to +0.4%) [145].

Another key parameter is L0 (potential CH4 generation capaci-
ty), defined as the total amount of CH4 potentially produced by a
metric ton of waste. L0 depends on waste composition, although the
potential for waste decay is also lower in dry climates where the
lack of moisture limits CH4 generation. The higher the organic content
of the waste, the higher the value of L0. The default values for L0
are 170 m3 Mg−1 for NMOC emissions and 100 m3 Mg−1 for CH4 gen-
eration (96 m3 Mg−1 for a bioreactor). USEPA [146] notes values of
L0 at particular sites vary from 6.2 to 270 m3 Mg−1.

LandGEM models can provide more data than just CH4 emis-
sions. Although LandGEM will forecast lifetime emissions on an
annual basis, it also forecasts standard pollutant outputs (the user
must specify a NMOC concentration; LandGEM will speciate the pro-
jected emissions) [144].

Some country specific variants of LandGEM have been created:
China, Columbia, Ecuador, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand, and the
Ukraine (Table 10). A Central American version has also been made
(it is linked to at the Dominican Republic country area of the Global
Methane Initiative website).

The China model has three climate variations which resulted in
default values for k: cold and dry (k = 0.04 yr−1), cold and wet
(k = 0.11 yr−1), and hot and wet (k = 0.18 yr−1). A combination of
climate and waste disposal practices was used to set default values
for L0. In dry climate zones, the default L0 = 70 m3 Mg−1, and in wet
climate zones the default L0 = 56 m3 Mg−1. If significant coal ash is
disposed (defined as >30% of waste inputs), L0 was decreased. For
landfills in cold and dry climates with significant coal, the default
L0 = 35 m3 Mg−1, for cold and wet L0 = 35 m3 Mg−1 (k = 0.11 yr−1), and
for hot and wet L0 = 42 m3 Mg−1. A fire discount value was as-
signed if observed, frequent fires are known to occur at a site (30%
of overall gas generation). Gas collection efficiency was discounted
depending on site management: lack of waste compaction, absence
of a working face, ineffective leachate management, shallow depth
of waste, absence of daily-intermediate-final cover, and absence of
the gas system in areas of the landfill. Otherwise, the default gas

collection efficiency was 85%. Although four landfills were sur-
veyed to test the model, insufficient information was available to
calibrate the model [148]. The model and manual are available in
Chinese.

The Columbia model has five geographical zones based roughly
on topography and climate. In addition, five rainfall regimes (dry
to very wet) were defined; these are applied in Zone 2 and Zone
3. Five categories of waste were defined (based on waste samples
from 51 cities) and these had default percentages assigned for the
zones. Values of k vary based on climate and the four degradable
waste categories (so there are 20 different default values). L0 values
were defined for each zone, using the IPCC calculation method (see
below), based on the assumed waste composition of the region and
IPCC default values for the other elements of the equation. Gas gen-
eration rates were discounted depending on four types of non-
sanitary landfills and the depth of waste (greater or less than 5 m),
and a history of fires. Similar to the China model, gas collection ef-
ficiency was discounted depending on specifics of site management:
lack of waste compaction, absence of a working face, ineffective lea-
chate management, shallow depth of waste, absence of daily-
intermediate-final cover, and absence of the gas system in areas of
the landfill. An additional discount was assigned for general poor
site management. Model results were compared to gas measure-
ments at two Columbia landfills [149]. The model and manual are
available in Spanish.

The Ecuador model set default k values based on four rainfall
amounts (0, 250, 500 and 1000 mm yr−1) and two categories of food
waste percentages (<50% or > 65%). It seems likely the k values are
meant to be interpolated if they fall between the set rainfall and
food waste parameters. Default L0 values were based on only three
rainfall amounts (0, 250, and 500 mm yr−1) and the two food waste
categories. Gas collection efficiency was based on the type of land-
fill gas extraction well used, how the landfill was capped, and the
mass of waste excluded from the gas collection area. The model was
not calibrated [150]. The model and manual are available in Spanish.
The first version of the Mexico model was developed in 2003;
it was re-done in 2009. The 2.0 Mexico model uses regional climate
and waste generation data to set default k and L0 values. Five cat-
egories of waste were defined, four of which are organic and decay
at varying rates. A landfill is assumed to have either the specific state
waste composition, if data are available, or the regional waste com-
position. Default k values were created for each region for each of
the four degradable waste categories (they varied by a factor of 3
from 0.1 yr−1 to 0.3 yr−1); an overall default k value for each site can
be computed based on waste composition. A similar process was
used to determine L0, although L0 was set to one value nationwide
for the quickest (69 m3 Mg−1), medium slow (214 m3 Mg−1), and
slowest (202 m3 Mg−1) decaying wastes. Gas generation and collec-
tion efficiency were discounted similarly to the Columbia model
(above). The model was not calibrated [151]. The model and manual
are available in Spanish.

The Philippines model classified all of the country as hot and wet,
although it was recognized some isolated sites might be classified
as dry (rainfall <1000 mm yr−1). The default value for k was set at
0.18 yr−1 (a dry landfill would use k = 0.10 yr−1). The default value
for L0 was 60 m3 Mg−1 (70 m3 Mg−1 for dry locations). A methane gen-
eration discount factor was applied to sites with a history of fires,
and methane collection efficiency was adjusted similarly to the way
it was for China (see above). The model was not calibrated [152].
The model and manual are available in Spanish; there was no link
to the model from the Methane-to-Markets Philippines Partner
Country page.

The Thailand model is structured exactly like the Philippines
model, and it was not calibrated [153]. The model and manual are
available in Thai; there was no link to the model from the Methane-
to-Markets Thailand Partner Country page.

The Ukraine model is structured similarly to the Mexico 2.0 model
(above), using similar factors to determine k and L0. The rainfall
amounts are different; default k values across the categories 0.011 yr−1
to 0.15 yr−1. Waste composition was based on 12 studies, and
national default values were determined for each of the four
degradable categories: very fast (L0 = 69 m3 Mg−1); medium fast
(L0 = 126 m3 Mg−1); medium slow (L0 = 214 m3 Mg−1); and slow
(L0 = 201 m3 Mg−1). Gas generation rates were discounted depend-
ing on four types of non-sanitary landfills and the depth of waste
(greater or less than 5 m), and the severity of any site fires. Similar
to the China model, gas efficiencies were adjusted based on site man-
agement. The model was not calibrated [154].

The Central America model was created for Belize, Costa Rica,
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, and
assumes most of the area receives high amounts of rain
(>1000 mm yr−1), but has adjustments for moderate rainfall and
dry regions. Values of k depend on waste composition. Two types
of waste are defined. One is fast decaying wastes (food and yard
wastes) which have high default k values: 0.23 yr−1 for high
rainfall, 0.20 yr−1 for moderate rainfall, and 0.18 yr−1 for dry areas.
All other organic wastes receive low default k values, which vary
by country and by rainfall category, and are almost an order of
magnitude lower (ranging from 0.020–0.033 yr−1). Each country
has an assigned waste composition, so the model can calculate a
set k for any landfill in each country. Default L0 values were
defined for each country, using the waste composition for the two
types of waste (fast and slow degrading). Gas generation rates
were discounted depending on four types of non-sanitary land-
fills and the depth of waste (greater or less than 5 m). Although
data from two landfills were collected to test the model, they
were insufficient to calibrate the model [147]. The model and
manual are available in Spanish. The Dominican Republic page at
the Methane-to-Markets webpage also links to the Central America
model. Since none of the countries the model was created for are
partners in the Methane-to-Markets program, none of them have
pages there to link to the model.

An adaptation of LandGEM 3.02 was made specifically for Finland
by researchers. It was calibrated to data collected at a large land-
fill, and the integrated decay factor of 0.18 yr−1 was much larger than
the default value for LandGEM of 0.05 yr−1, and on the high end of
the US range of 0.003–0.21 yr−1 [155].

LandGEM was used with redefined k values for waste classes,
based on data from landfills and laboratory mesocosm experi-
ments, creating an overall k value for landfilled US waste generally.
An additional factor w, a measure of the biodegradation state in the
landfill, was added to the LandGEM model to reduce gas genera-
tion when conditions were not optimal. The intention was to better
forecast and control tmax, the time of greatest gas generation. En-
hancing degradation conditions affected tmax more than changing
the composition of the wastes [156]. Similarly, LandGEM has been
coupled with measured waste, gas, and leachate factors to create
a decision-support model to determine whether gas collection was
likely to be economically viable. It was hypothesized that compari-
sons of site measurements to literature values for methanogenic
landfill conditions could determine whether landfill wastes were
decomposing “as expected,” or if gas production model estimates
should be adjusted. Sites where landfill dynamics were different than
expected might have problems meeting gas production forecasts
[157].

4.2. IPCC models

IPCC has developed two methodologies (Tier 1 and Tier 2) for
estimating CH4 generation and emissions from landfills. The Tier 1
method calculates CH4 emissions based on annual solid waste dis-
posal quantities, whereas Tier 2 method is a FOD method [106,107].
Due to the quality and quantity of available data, developed coun-
tries tend to apply the FOD method while developing countries rely
on the Tier 1 method [109].

The Tier 1 method is the default methodology for quantifying
annual CH4 emissions from solid waste disposal. Similarly in concept
to LandGEM, landfill CH4 generation is calculated based on MSW
generation data (either measured or calculated), the landfilled frac-
tion of generated waste, and the potential CH4 generation capacity,
except calculated not on a site basis but for a country or part of a
country, and based solely on a single year’s data – no accounting
is made for previously landfilled wastes (Equations (4) and (5)). Net
CH4 emissions are determined by subtracting CH4 recovery and ox-
idation (Equation (6)).

For areas where more detailed data are available, the Tier 2

tity of waste landfilled in each year used to estimate CH4 generation
for the base year, and then decaying the methane generation over
time. The amount generated for each area is integrated over time
(Equation (7)).

For countries with very good data sets, “Tier 3” methods based
on FOD methods applied to specific landfills, or actual data on CH4
emissions from sites, can be substituted for the broader methods
discussed here. So, for instance, US landfill release values gener-
ated by USEPA in the annual Greenhouse Gas Inventories are
generated based on the FOD model. USEPA modified the model to
match results from a survey of 52 US landfills, which were found
to be affected by rainfall. Therefore US landfills were stratified into
three climate categories (high rainfall, medium rainfall, low rain-
fall), with CH4 generation rates dependent on the climate and waste
inputs. The total amount of CH4 generated was reduced by data speci-
fying gas combusted to produce energy or flared prior to release,
with a 10% reduction additionally applied to account for
methanotrope consumption of CH4 at the landfill–atmosphere in-
terface [27].

In Finland, sampling at a large landfill resulted in a k value of
0.18 yr−1, which is twice as large as the default value for wet boreal
and temperate climates. The landfill’s production of CH4 was there-
fore twice as great over an 18-yr time period than the IPCC model
predicted [155].

4.3. Other models

There are some other models that are variants on the LandGEM
and IPCC models. The Belgium model is very similar to LandGEM,
and the German EPER model is similar to the IPCC model. A vali-
dation study of all of these models and the Scholl Canyon model
found LandGEM typically underestimated CH4 generation, by 10%
on average but the other models tended to over predict gas outputs,
sometimes by average multiples of 3 (especially for higher values
of waste DOC) [158]. Still, most accounts assume LandGEM and the
IPCC approaches successfully track overall trends if not absolute
outputs in CH4 generation. It is understood they do not account for
variable waste characteristics and uncertainties associated with
changeable environmental conditions. The models almost always
use default oxidation rates of 10%, established in 1996 based on data
from one site [159], although site specific rates are known to vary
widely from that rate. Therefore, IPCC itself recognizes the accu-
racy of CH4 estimations is poor, with deviations as much as 200%
[160].

One variant to LandGEM introduced differential decay rates for
specific portions of the waste stream. This model could be used to
estimate future impacts to gas generation (and collection) associ-
ated with changing waste composition, due to differences in
materials use and diversion programs (such as declining paper dis-
cards due to the newspaper industry’s decline) in the OECD, and

47

forecasts of increasing food waste diversions. It can be tuned so that
relative decay rates for each organic component can equal in ag-
gregate the decay rates assumed for waste as a whole. It matches
LandGEM for initial gas generation rates, of course, but differ-
ences develop over time, due to forecast changes in incoming wastes
and also differences in the composition of residual landfilled ma-
terials (gas generation falls off more quickly because the model
decays more degradable materials first) [161].

Better models would include factors such as characteristics of
landfill covers, specific methanotrophic CH4 oxidation rates, and me-
teorological conditions [162]. A model that includes these factors
is the California Landfill Methane Inventory Model (CALMIM).
CALMIM is a field-validated one-dimensional methane transpor-
tation and oxidation model that estimates landfill methane
emissions. CALMIM does not rely on a first order model for methane
generation, but rather works with data on the major processes that
control emissions: (1) surface area and properties of the daily, in-
termediate, and final cover materials; (2) the percentage of surface
area for each cover type with engineered gas recovery; and (3) sea-
sonal methane oxidation in each cover type as controlled by climate
factors. CALMIM incorporates two climate-related factors, meteo-
rology and soil microclimate, which are automatically accessed
according to the site location and physical properties of cover ma-
terials. In addition, CALMIM calculates daily emissions for each cover
type which are summed to provide an annual total for the site [162].
However, CALMIM itself excludes important elements in CH4 gen-
eration processes: (1) it does not include trends of LFG generation;
(2) it does not include gas transport mechanisms other than dif-
fusion, such as convection, ebullition, plant-mediated transport; (3)
it does not assign LFG recovery efficiency. Nonetheless, CALMIM has
been validated at several landfills [162].

It should be noted it has only been validated at landfills with
LFG collection systems. Its effectiveness is unknown if it were applied
in developing countries. In China, for instance, although larger, more
recent landfills have installed gas collection systems, LFG recovery
rates even at these sites are low, generally below 30% [163,164],
which are well below efficiency values used in CALMIM.

A gas generation model developed at the University of Texas the
(CLEEN model) requires input data for waste composition, rainfall,
and temperature. Values for k were developed through parameter-
ization of different types of waste by means of laboratory mescosm
experiments. The model was calibrated using data from 11 land-
fills, and a multi-variate regression on the three input variables for
the calibrated model had r2 = 0.79. When its outputs were com-
pared to those from the IPCC and LandGEM models and to site data,
the CLEEN model outperformed at four of six sites [165].

The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) allows a signatory
to the Kyoto Protocol with a commitment to reduce carbon emis-
sions to sponsor or otherwise support a carbon reduction project
in a developing country, and apply a credit for the developing cou-
ntry’s reduction to its own commitment through standardized
emission offsets (CERs) [166]. In order to claim a CER, it must be
demonstrated that the project would not have proceeded other-
wise. This most often means the activity must not be mandated
[167]. For CDM credits, a special model needs to be used. The model
is driven by Equation (8) [168]:

This model is intended to allow a standard calculation for CDM
credits. Verification of model outputs (compared to actual gas pro-
duction at China landfills) found the model under-predicts gas
generation. Analysts believe this is because decay rates (k) are too
low; it also could be that the default values for the gas capture ef-
ficiency (f) are incorrect. For China, they were originally set at 30%
or 40%, and were raised to 60%; but there had been no field veri-
fication of actual capture efficiency [168].

There are two common attitudes toward the more widely used
models. One is that generally poor performance (in that models tend
to badly predict actual gas production) can be corrected by adjust-
ing model parameters [143,169]. For these practitioners, any model
of gas production can be tuned so as to reproduce what the land-
fill generates. Others [170] believe that models of the LandGem–
IPCC lineage are conceptually flawed; for them, a new basic
understanding of landfill processes leads to selection of an alter-
native (CALMIM). CALMIM outputs still require correction factors
for each site, but Bogner and Spokas [170] believe that these cor-
rections are better grounded in actual site-specific factors that
directly relate to methane generation, such as cover area and type,
and climate. The general underlying lack of validity for all models,
however, is demonstrated by the need to heavily adjust param-
eters so that modeled outputs match measured outputs.

4.4. Techniques to monitor methane emissions

Measurement of LFG emissions is often carried out by the flux
chamber method, especially in settings where more complicated
experimental approaches appear difficult to install such as in less
developed areas (cf. Refs. 103, 131, 132, 162, 171, and 172), or where
power supplies are unavailable [173], but also still commonly at
many North American and European landfills [174,175]. Flow cham-
bers are non-intrusive and portable, and allow for repeated
measurements with relative ease. A container is set, sealed to the
atmosphere, on the landfill surface. For the static chamber, gas ac-
cumulates due to emissions from the landfill surface, and its
constituents and their concentrations can be determined at an exit
port. For a dynamic flux chamber, a controlled flow of gas flows
through the chamber and mixes with the emissions, and flows out
exit ports. The mixed gas can be analyzed and then emission rates
calculated from the results [176]. Negative values can result, and
suggest the soil microbes have consumed atmospheric CH4
[103–105]. Sensitivity is approximately 1 μg m2 s−1 [174], which
means data at controlled sites may not be as accurate as desired:
quantified emissions for landfills range from hundreds to thou-
sands of μg m−2 s−1 at uncontrolled landfills, and fractions to hundreds
of μg m−2 s−1 at sites with gas control [101,102,177]. Results are spa-
tially variable at any particular site, often by many orders of
magnitude, and it becomes labor intensive to generate extensive cov-
erage of a site [178]; instruments are subject to measurement drift,
and maintaining seals on rough surfaces is sometimes an issue [174].
The measurement variability means that extrapolation across one

48

site or to other sites is often approached hesitantly [102]. An im-
portant aspect of the closed chamber method is the analytic approach
taken to reify the readings made over the sampling period. Short
time scales mean the variations approximate a linear regression, but
longer sampling periods appear to require more complicated ap-
proximation means [173]. Flux chambers are very good at quantifying
localized gas releases; static chambers can have biased results at
higher flow rates due to the generation of back pressure which can
inhibit outflows from the soil [175], or even force some of the
emitted gas back into the soil [174]. As mentioned earlier, mea-
surements from the flux chamber methods vary over seven orders
of magnitude: from less than 0.0004 g m−2 d−1 [101] to more than
10,000 g m−2 d−1 [102].

Mass balance methods have been developed. Two perpendicu-
lar to the wind transects are established (upgradient and
downgradient), and a planar value for CH4 is determined for both.
The difference is the landfill output. The methane integrals are usually
measured by either Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrosco-
py [179] or tunable diode laser adsorption spectroscopy [177]. These
create one-time estimates of CH4 emissions, and are difficult to rep-
licate because of high labor requirements and changes in particular
measurement topographies because different wind conditions require
changes in the locations of the transects [139]. The modeling ap-
proach was developed to measure gas releases over flat ground, and
so has been modified to work on landfill settings that often have
steep slopes; often these adjusted modeling results did not meet
QA/QC expectations [177]. However, by creating an average CH4 con-
centration over a large area, variability associated with point
measurements can be ignored, and all emissions from an area can
be accounted for [174], and using multiple beam paths to gener-
ate data makes the measurements more robust [179]. The availability
of FTIR equipment in many technical laboratories makes it attrac-
tive and it has been used in a number of instances to generate
emissions data (e.g. Refs. 103, 171, and 180); it has also been iden-
tified as a good means of monitoring large but distinct areas at a
site, which can be differentiated if the wind is in the right direc-
tion [175]. As suggested by the mass balance label, two measurement
sets are created: one for upgradient conditions, and one for the site.
Upgradient gas amounts are subtracted to generate net emission
values (which can also account for consumption of atmospheric CH4
by landfill soils) [177]. To address variability of FTIR measure-
ments at a site in Canada, a multivariate ANOVA was used to generate
a statistical model incorporating temperature, barometric pres-
sure, and precipitation effects to interpolate releases when
measurements were not being made [180]. One set of emissions data,
for US landfills with intermediate cover (not considered to limit emis-
sions much), ranged from 4–140 g m−2 d−1, with a maximum reading
of 210 g m−2 d−1 [177], the equivalent of 60 μg m−2 s−1 to 1.5 mg m−2 s−1,
with the maximum = 2.2 mg m−2 s−1. Capped landfills were at least
an order of magnitude less than the lowest value for intermediate
cover, and as much as three orders of magnitude less [177].

Tracer methods for whole landfill gas emission measurements
have been developed. Inert tracers, most often SF6 (but some-
times N2O and/or CO [175]) are released across the landfill at known
rates. At an appropriate distance from the landfill (determined by
air modeling) where the tracer should be well-mixed, samples are
taken. The ratio of LFG constituents to the tracer indicates the release
rate of LFG. General topography should be flat near the landfill,
weather is an important variable, other sources of LFG constitu-
ents (feedlots, sewage treatment plants, etc.) can interfere with single
source determinations, and the LFG release rate often needs to be
high to ensure detectable amounts are measured downgradient
[102,139,175,178].

Spokas et al. [102] reported good agreements (r2 = 0.81) between
tracer and closed chamber sampling; Heroux et al. [180] reported
better agreement between FTIR and closed chamber sampling

(r2 = 0.91). There was good correspondence (±10%) between FTIR and
closed chamber sampling in one sampling instance in Taiwan, but
in a second sampling effort, atmospheric concentrations mea-
sured by FTIR were higher than closed chamber data, and varied
directly with organic carbon content in the samples [103].

Eddy covariance has also been used to measure fluxes from land-
fills. Measurements made of gas concentrations at a certain distance
above the landfill, and using theories regarding turbulent mixing,
are compared to wind speeds over a set time period (30–60 min).
This method generates release estimates integrated over an upwind
distance equal to 10 times the height of the instrumentation, there-
fore creating a large areal footprint for the flux, which is useful at
a landfill [139].

Eddy covariance was used to continuously monitor CO2 and CH4
and emissions at a capped but vented Nebraska landfill for more
than 3 years. The ratio of CO2 to CH4 was significantly greater in
summer than in winter, suggesting greater activity by soil
methanotropes in summer, and emissions were higher in winter than
summer. Increasing barometric pressure (for instance, a passing front)
could suppress CH4 emissions within minutes, although when pres-
sure changes were averaged out over longer periods of time,
emissions were stable, attributed to the landfill maintaining near
constant internal temperatures. There was some uncertainty over
whether barometric or wind direction changes were the primary
driver of emission variance, but a spectral analysis of the data sets
suggested a monitoring period of at least 10 days would be re-
quired to capture 90% of the emission data variance. It appears that
“soil pumping” is the process driving the changes in releases (which
is primarily but not entirely a phenomenon caused by changes in
atmospheric pressures) [139].

Remote sensing (aircraft or elevated towers) can be used to
measure atmospheric CH4 and determine regional variations. The
variations can then be attributed to sources, including landfills. These
techniques can support large-scale screening projects, and have been
used to refine considerations regarding major contributors to CH4
emissions [181].

A modeling estimation technique has been developed for the US,
where the regulatory requirement to measure ambient air for NMOC
on a quarterly basis generates repeated, robust data sets. Cross-
wind and downwind variations in concentrations are analyzed using
standard gas dispersion equations. The resulting NMOC data are then
related to CH4 emissions. The technique also accounts for spatial
and temporal variability in emissions, and compared well to con-
current FTIR surveys at a Florida landfill [182].

Sometimes very simple techniques can be used to survey land-
fills. PID-FID meters and hand-held methane gas monitors can be
used to quickly assess potential point sources, and PID-FID meters
have been used along transects to create emission estimates. Often,
careful observations may suffice, as landfill gas often smells bad,
and major release points can be identified by smelling them [181].

5. Fate of methane in landfills

5.1. Methane generation in landfills

Open dumping has been practiced by civilizations for millen-
nia, using the principle of “out of sight, out of mind”. Wastes in open
dumps are often burned to control odors and reduce vectors, or
perhaps catch on fire accidentally. Wastes are not inspected or oth-
erwise controlled. They are not compacted or placed using any
engineering concepts. Managed dumps are somewhat more orga-
nized: wastes may be inspected, dumping areas identified,
stormwater management and basic cover materials provided [167].
The first sanitary landfill (a fill engineered to control the progres-
sion of filling, and using cover materials to reduce waste exposure
to the environment) is thought to have been in Britain, in 1916 [183].

X. Chai et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 56 (2016) 33–70

49

In the twenty-first century, low income countries typically have “low
technology sites,” with open dumping, middle income countries have
some landfills with controlled filling and environmental controls
(managed dumps), and even some sanitary landfills, and high income
countries exclusively use sanitary landfills with extensive environ-
mental control systems [110].

Landfills (and dumps) do not have aeration systems and receive
a loading that contains a great deal of organic matter. Near the
surface, organics are oxidized aerobically [99]. However, slightly
below the surface of the landfill air circulation from the atmo-
sphere is minimized, and anaerobic digestion of organic material
occurs, which rapidly becomes dominated by methanogenesis [111].
Wastes are typically quickly buried at the working face of a sani-
tary landfill, minimizing exposure to aerobic conditions. Once
methanogenetic conditions exist, the process has a positive feed-
back, since the production of CH4 and CO2 as microbial metabolic
waste gases makes the landfill a net source of gas to the atmo-
sphere and surrounding subsurface, making infiltration of
atmospheric gases into the waste mass more difficult. Landfill gas
(LFG) migrates primarily by a combined mechanism of diffusion and
convection; convection results from pressure gradients induced
within the landfill by differential outgassing from microbes, medi-
ated by differences in pressure between the landfill and the
surrounding atmosphere. Typically, a dry, uncapped landfill will be
in equilibrium with the atmosphere; however, a landfill with a satu-
rated surface will not, although elevated pressures will develop in
phase with changes in atmospheric pressures [111]. There tends to
be more gas release from landfills at low atmospheric pressure times,
therefore, and the differences can be sharp [139]. Diffusion exists
because of unequal concentrations of gas, caused by differences in
generation rates along with subsequent advection patterns [184].
Landfill gas, which is composed of approximately equal parts CH4
(0.656 kg m−3, lighter than air) and CO2 (1.977 kg m−3, denser than
air), is approximately the same density as the atmosphere
(1.225 kg m−3). Therefore, since it has approximately neutral buoy-
ancy, it will migrate along paths of greatest conductivity: sideways
or downward through the subsurface or upward through the land-
fill. At closed landfills with no or incomplete liner systems, putting
an impermeable cap on the landfill can cause all gas migration to
be forced laterally, increasing off-site, subsurface migration [184].
Gas collection systems, however, appear to minimize if not elimi-
nate lateral migration [102].

The development of gas production in a landfill has been clas-
sically defined as having five stages [98] (Fig. 4). Modern landfills

(with effective liners and impermeable caps) have not been oper-
ated long enough to determine with certainty when gas production
will cease. Sanitary landfills with less effective liners and cap systems
appear to generate gas at high levels for approximately 20 years after
being capped, and continue to produce gas for at least 50 years [26],
although descriptions of degradation within landfills vary widely,
ranging from 3–10% [133], up to 50% [185] to “most” [186] through
20 yrs. Complete consumption of organic material in a sanitary land-
fill may take centuries or millennia, depending on cap effectiveness
and the time to eventual cap and liner failure [187]. However, in
the short term atmospheric gases (80% N2, 20% O2) are replaced
within the landfill by increasing amounts of CO2 as aerobic respi-
ration consumes organic matter; there is a brief time of H2
production; methanotropes consume produced H2 and replace it with
increasing amounts of CH4. Methane slowly grows so that it has
slightly greater concentrations than CO2
(see below) as
methanogenesis dominates the degradation of organic materials,
although some descriptions find their concentrations to be about
equal. Eventually, methanogenesis will cease and the landfill will
aerate again. Some models suggest that if the landfill dries out prior
to consumption of all labile carbon, eventual failure of the cap and
liner systems will re-initiate the sequence described in Fig. 5, which
may then continue until all consumable organic matter that remains
in the landfill has been depleted [187].

The degradation of organic matter has classically been de-
scribed using reduction–oxidation (redox) chemistry [188]. Table 11
shows the chemistry of the reactions on generalized organic matter.
This description is drawn from marine sediments, where the zo-
nation is often well-defined. In landfills, the zonations are indistinct,
and it may be that micro-environments form where one process
dominates over the others due to availability of electron acceptors
[189,190] which act as limits to methanogenesis. Aerobic decom-
position of matter releases an order of magnitude more energy than
methanogenesis, and, except for sulfate reducers, other anaerobic
oxidation pathways produce much more energy, too [38].

Phase I (Aerobic) is the initial adjustment phase, also known as
the aerobic phase because of its high oxygen concentration. Car-
bohydrates, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonium are oxidized and
volatile fatty acids (VFA) are gradually produced [98]. The main re-
action can be described as Equation (9). The duration of aerobic
decomposition is under dispute, with the standard model suggest-
ing buried wastes remain aerobic for a few hours to one week [98].
Those who believe landfills release more CH4 than is generally said
to be the case ascribe to the shortest time period for Phase I. Some

who believe landfills are more benign describe longer aerobic
periods, which can be months long. Variations from site to site may
account for some of these differences in opinion. Staley et al. [191]
suggested that uneven distribution of moisture, as a strong control
on microbial activity, is a determinant of whether degradation pro-
ceeds rapidly.

Phase II (Anaerobic but Non-Methanogenic) is a transition phase.
Once oxygen is generally less than 5–10% (v/v), facultative and an-
aerobic bacteria are activated in places in the landfill [98]. Under
anaerobic condition, nitrate and sulfate (as well as iron and man-
ganese in saturated zones) become terminal electron acceptors (Eqs.
(9), (10a), (10b), (11), and (12)). The reduction of nitrate produces
ammonia and the reduction of sulfate produces hydrogen sulfide.
This phase may last six months, although some reports document
90% CO2 gas concentrations after 40 days [176].

Phase III (Unsteady Anaerobic Methanogenic) is an acid forma-
tion phase. Anaerobic hydrolytic microorganisms increase rapidly,
resulting in the generation of volatile organic acids (VOA) and H2.
Acidogenic bacteria grow in numbers, consuming the VOA. Bacte-
rial growth reduces the availability of nutrients. Carbon dioxide is
predominant waste gas released by organisms within the landfill.
The accumulation of VOA and CO2 tends to reduce pH in the land-
fill; values as low as 5 have been reported. Peak production of H2
occurs in this phase, and methanogenesis begins [98], despite reports
from other environments such as peat that low pH values can en-
tirely inhibit methanogenesis [192]. This phase lasts months to
several years; two years is the most widely used estimate (cf. Ref.
26), but values of less than 1 yr are also widely cited [176]. Those
believing landfills rapidly produce CH4 will assign much shorter time
periods to the non-methanogenic phases.

Cellulose and hemicellulose are believed to be the predomi-
nant degradable portions of wastes [88]; lignin has been found to
be much more recalcitrant. Concentrations of cellulose and hemi-
cellulose were called “reasonably consistent” in samples of fresh
wastes in North Carolina, and except for food wastes, VFA were
absent from the wastes as they were landfilled. Different fractions
of wastes have different proportions of the key components, with
leaves enriched in lignin and paper enriched in cellulose [88]). In
waste samples, fresh waste can have a 4:1 ratio of cellulose to lignin,
whereas older degraded samples tend to have a ratio of less than

1. At one California landfill, sample ratios for older wastes were all
less than 0.1. The implications are that cellulose degrades in land-
fills, but lignin does not. There is additional evidence that lignin
actually impedes cellulose degradation [88]. Note a study in the UK
found that the age of waste (from 1 year to several decades) did not
have an effect on CH4 emissions – albeit emissions are different from
CH4 generation rates [174].

Microbes causing degradation do not appear to be transported
much within the landfill, due to uncertain and irregular water flows
associated with low hydraulic conductivity in much waste, and the
development of preferential flow paths, and so are assumed to be
present but inactive in the delivered wastes [191]. Water flows are
also likely to be the best means to transport nutrients and organic
substrates [193], so wastes outside of flow paths or isolated from
other wastes inside plastic bags are unlikely to degrade quickly, if
at all. Since collected wastes are mostly aerobic, the microbial com-
munities must either be facultative or able to survive long exposures
to oxic conditions. However, the microbial community structure of
fresh waste, which is strongly influenced by microbial species as-
semblages associated with food waste, is very different from that
of degraded waste [191]. Initiation of methanogenesis, as tracked
by mesocosm experiments, requires the presence of VOA, and occurs
at relatively low pH (as low as 5.5). VOA are produced when hy-
drolytic bacteria degrade cellulose and hemicellulose faster than
acetogens and methanogens can convert the VOA to CH4 [191]. Deg-
radation of the cellulose appears to be accomplished by a varied
set of thermophilic, motile bacteria, comprising at least four dis-
[194].
tinct isolates in samples from an English landfill
Methanosarcina barkeri appeared to be the dominant methanogenic
organism in the first stage of methanogenesis. As CH4 concentra-
tions increase, higher pH values were found in saturated areas of
mesocosms, creating an advancing front of methanogenesis [192].
The Archaea methanogens then are able to outcompete organisms
found in aerobic communities, due to better fit with environmen-
tal conditions. The dominant methanogens are Methanomicrobiales
and Methanosarcinales. Organisms found in leachate samples,
however, are not similar to those found in waste samples [191]; in
fact, samples from a Taiwan landfill leachate found that although
these same two lineages were the dominant methanogens, they rep-
resented only 2% of the total community (as measured by

oligonucleotide probes, which represent population numbers only
approximately) [195].

Phase IV (Steady Anaerobic Methanogenic) is the methane fer-
mentation phase. During this phase, intermediate VOA are consumed
by methanogenic bacteria and converted into CH4 and CO2 [98],
shown as Equation (13). In addition, CO2 can be consumed if H2 is
present, producing CH4 and water (Equation (15)).

Since some of the CO2 in turn is consumed to produce more CH4,
most landfills have LFG that is 50–60% CH4 and 40–50% CO2 (v/v).
Sulfate continues to be reduced, as well. The landfill pH rises due
to the bicarbonate buffering system; since methanogens generally
need higher pHs to thrive, this is a positive feedback resulting in
relatively more CH4 production. The duration of this phase in
unknown, but appears to be at least 10 years, and probably is at
least 50 years [26], and may be more. Availability of water within
the landfill is an essential consideration. Note that Themelis and Ulloa
[99] believe data show 50% of all labile organic matter is turned into
CH4 within one year.

Phase V represents the stabilization of the waste mass, when it
no longer degrades. When LFG generation ceases, atmospheric gases
will permeate back into the landfill, and oxidized chemistry will
re-appear.

The overall conversion from organic compounds to methane and
carbon dioxide in the landfill may stoichiometrically be expressed
as Buswell formula (Equation (1)) [86]:

All-in-all, LFG production is sensitive to moisture, tempera-
ture, oxygen, hydrogen, pH/alkalinity, sulfate, nutrients, and various
inhibitors [98,196], although temperature may not be important
[139]. Moisture is key; maximum gas production appears to occur
at 60–80% wet weight moisture content. Dry climate landfills ex-
perience spikes in gas production after rainfalls, but in temperate
climates heavy rainfalls appear to temporarily inhibit gas produc-
tion, possibly by filling preferential flow pathways [176]. Temperature
has also been identified as a controlling variable. One consider-
ation for waste degradation was Equation (16):

where

hd = fraction of biodegradable wastes eventually degraded
T = temperature of waste mass (°C)

Under mesophilic (~35 °C) conditions, the efficiency is ex-
pected to reach ~75% [193]. The state of the wastes, including
differing origins (industrial, commercial, residential) and whether
they are shredded will affect degradation [193]; recent prefer-
ences in the US for tightly baled and wrapped bundles of wastes
that enhance transportability are likely to suppress degradation, as
well.

Barlaz [191] estimated gas generation (based on laboratory land-
fill reactors, with shredded biomass and constant water inputs) at
0.153 g CH4 g biomass−1. USEPA [26] has modeled a 21% reduction
in decomposable material being landfilled (1990–2012), partly due
to recycling and partly due to changes in materials use; USEPA has
modeled a related 30% decrease in CH4 generation at landfills. Other
developed nations are probably experiencing similar trends; waste
disposal trends in developing nations are probably different, as
growing affluence is likely to increase paper and overall discards
[110].

USEPA modeling [26] assigns a 40% reduction factor for dumps
compared to sanitary landfills. Most nations under the IPCC pro-
tocols appear not to count dumps or informal disposal sites in CH4
generation inventories.

It is generally understood that most carbon placed in landfills
does not degrade [26], although this is not universally agreed to.
Scheutz et al. [181] asserted LFG is generated until “the majority”
of wastes has been degraded, which was said could take several
decades. But, tremendous odors occurred when 2000 year old Roman
waste were uncovered [197], indicating degradation may not have
completed over a short time period. Rathje [133] was able to date
landfilled wastes in the US by reading newspapers (often 30–40 years
old), and reported finding intact items such as bananas and hot dogs
30 years after burial. Rathje’s opinion was that yard waste and food
degraded in many landfills, but most other organic matter did not.
Landfill settlement rates are often less than expected. Maximum set-
tling of landfill surfaces may approach 40%, but only about 40% of
total settling (15% of the original thickness) is expected to be from
waste decomposition. The remainder of the settling is due to waste
consolidation and mechanical creep [198]. Sanitary landfills can be
more than 100 m thick but rarely settle more than 10–20 m. This
failure for landfills to “disappear” supports the concept that most
degradable materials are preserved in sanitary landfills.

Experimental tests show waste degrades. The Barlaz laborato-
ry, working with mesocosm landfill analogs for several decades, has
shown ground, moist organic material will degrade under landfill
conditions [199]. Food was shown to degrade rapidly and readily
although CH4 inhibition occurred with a subset of samples, appar-
ently due to high VOA [200]; grass samples nearly all degraded, and
over half of corrugated cardboard and office paper was degraded
to CH4, so that about 50% of all degradable MSW was gasified [199].
But not all constituents degrade even under these optimal anaer-
obic conditions [201]. In landfills, with plastic wraps, differential
and uneven exposure to water, and other factors, it is clear that most
degradable compounds do not evolve into CH4 in sanitary landfills
[191], at least partly due to isolation from water flows carrying nu-
trients [193], so that, in a sense, landfills constitute a carbon
sequestration vehicle for time periods of decades to centuries [201].
It has been argued eventually the organic matter will decay, al-
though it may take millennia [187]. Operating a landfill as a
bioreactor to increase degradation rates (recirculating and poten-
tially supplementing leachate to keep wastes wetter) can
approximately double the decay constant, but does not ensure ap-
preciably greater degradation of the landfilled material; it may just
shift decay earlier in the life of the landfill [202].

Modeling landfill behavior has been attempted, but the com-
plexity of the process means these simulations have difficulty
replicating actual observed outputs at a site. There are physical,
chemical, and biological reactions occurring in heterogeneous liquid,
gas, and solid phases. Some attempts to capture this very compli-
cated environment include Wall and Zeiss [203], Zacharof and Butler
[204], Hanson et al. [205], Lobo et al. [206], McDougal [207], Gourc
et al. [208], and Robeck et al. [209].

5.2. Methane oxidation in landfills

Microbes in a variety of environments oxidize CH4 to CO2. There
is great such activity in deep-sea sediments (70 Tg CH4 yr−1), where
methane oxidizing organisms appear to be symbiotic with sulfate
reducing bacteria. The marine sediment oxidizers appear to be
Archaea, with strong genetic links to methanogens [57]. This met-
abolic activity appears to be close to the lower limit of beneficial
energy recovery [210]; this low level of activity may be supported
because some methanotropes may link to manganese and iron re-
ducers which are energetically more favorable [211]. In terrestrial
environments, methane oxidizers occur primarily in upland,

52

X. Chai et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 56 (2016) 33–70

forested settings and take up CH4 from the atmosphere, appar-
ently without any microbial symbiosis. They oxidize considerable
amounts of atmospheric CH4: 30 Tg yr−1 (2–3% of released CH4) [12],
which, given the smaller terrestrial area compared to oceanic areas,
indicates a similar overall activity level. Terrestrial methane oxi-
dizers are inhibited by ammonium, which is present in fertilizers,
so applications of fertilizers decrease CH4 removals, a growing
concern with the increase in worldwide agriculture [12].

Uptake at landfills appears to be different in certain ways. Or-
ganisms in cover soils consume CH4 in much higher CH4
concentration environments [139]. These organisms primarily oxidize
CH4 to CO2 to support metabolism and use some of the CH4 for as-
similation, as well. They appear to primarily be obligate aerobes.
Differences among landfill specific organism groups include the
ability to co-metabolize other non-CH4 organic compounds, CH4 con-
sumption rates, O2 requirements, the CH4 concentration that triggers
oxidation, temperature and moisture change resiliency, and the
release of various extracellular chemicals (at least partially to address
internal production of formaldehyde) [212]. These extracellular
chemicals can clog soil pores and prevent organisms from access-
ing gas [193]. In general, methanotropes transform more CH4 in
summer than winter [139]. Although they represent a variety of or-
ganisms with different abilities and traits (for instance, not all oxidize
CH4, and some additionally transform NMOC in landfill gas), this
set of soil organisms that are involved in transforming CH4 and re-
ducing releases to the atmosphere are lumped together as
“methanotropes” [212].

Oxidation of CH4 requires methane mono-oxygenases [181], and
follows the following pathway: CH4 to methanol to formaldehyde
to formic acid to CO2 [213]. There are two ways to assimilate CH4.
Type I methanotropes (eight genera in Methylococcaceae) assim-
ilate formaldehyde via the ribulose monophosphate pathway, but
Type II methanotropes (four genera in Methylocystacecae) assim-
ilate formaldehyde through the serine pathway [193]. Approximately
50% of CH4 affected by these microbes is assimilated, and the re-
mainder
is oxidized, providing metabolic energy [181].
to ammonia-oxidizing
Methanotropes are very similar
chemoautotrophs [213]. In cover soils, some oxidation of CH4 may
proceed chemically, as the atmosphere mixes diffusively and through
soil pumping with landfill gases in the top soil layers of the land-
fill [214]. Then, OH· reactions, just as in the open atmosphere, will
oxidize CH4 to CO2, as discussed in Section 1.

Coarse sandy soils support substantial CH4 oxidation [215], al-
though higher carbon content is preferential: the salient feature of
sands is its good structure, so silty or sandy loams are probably the
best soil types overall for methanotropes. Low and high moisture
levels impede gas production [193]. The presence of plants appears
to enhance methanotropism. This may be because many organ-
isms establish symbiotic relationships with rhizosomes, and also
because the rhizosphere generally appears to be a favorable envi-
it may be that
ronment for bacteria [193]. Additionally,
methanotropism is generally N-limited [181], and root zones are
often prime locations for nitrogen fixation. The establishment of
plants on a landfill surface enhances reduction of CH4 releases and
decreases associated soil concentrations; it may also be that de-
creases in soil CH4 concentrations enhance conditions to foster plant
growth; in any case, older landfill sections support more plants and
have lower soil gas concentrations of CH4 [163]. Interruption of gas
supplies to the surface soils has a small impact on populations of
methanotropes. Methanotropism is detected in anoxic soils as well
as oxygenated soil, suggesting at least some of the community is
facultative, although greatest consumption occurs in more aerated
environments [215], and, generally, O2
is necessary for
methanotropes. Gas extraction systems can increase the depth of
methanotropism by drawing atmospheric gases deeper into the land-
fill than they might naturally diffuse to. Maximum CH4 oxidation

rates by methanotropes appear to be 250 g m−2 d−1 (2–3 mg m−2 s−1)
[181]; most reports are for much lower oxidation rates [213]. At three
French landfills, where gas migrated to the atmosphere (as opposed
to being entirely controlled by the gas collection system), between
4% and 50% of the fugitive CH4 was consumed [102]; a landfill with
specially prepared cover material oxidized 55% of fugitive CH4 [216].
Some data suggest 80% reductions can be achieved [217] with at
least one experimental achievement of 90% reductions [218]. In ad-
dition to comparisons of modeled gas generation to releases to the
atmosphere as a means of determining methanotropism, indirect
measurement of CH4 consumption can be estimated using δ13C of
collected CH4 in flux chamber experiments. Methanotropes prefer
C12, therefore increasing the δ13C of gas as it passes from the land-
to the atmosphere, so changes in CH4 δ13C indicate
fill
methanotropism [102]. And, not only will methanotropes reduce
CH4 releases at landfills, they also degrade important NMOC such
as aliphatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) and chlorinated
solvents (trichloroethylene and 1,1,1-trichoroethane) [213,214], with
significant reductions being measured in the field [216].

Modeling this process is not simple. There are two transport
media (gas and liquids), and reactions are multi-component. In
porous media, molecule–molecule reactions dominate, and so dif-
fusive processes are often more important than advective processes
(which need to account for tortuosity as well) [217]. However, it
is also asserted that small pressure gradients within the landfill or
very coarse soils can drive advection to be the dominant transport
process. At the edge of the landfill, and where leachate seeps occur,
bubbling (ebullition) mechanisms are important [181]. Unequal
density of the target gases affects considerations, as well. When
modeled, it appears that diffusion is the dominant transport mech-
anism within the active methanotropic zone. Moisture reduces
reactions by slowing O2 diffusion into the soils. The model did not
show significant effects (over time periods of weeks) from exuda-
tions that could clog pore spaces [217]. Models of methanotropism
help elucidate process controls, and there was fair agreement
between a model and field measurements made when argon gas
was used as a tracer, which was interpreted as suggesting these
models may capture some of the natural dynamics, as well [181].
Methane generation models typically apply a constant correction
factor to account for methanotropism, most often decreasing re-
leases by 10%.

Biosystems (soils or other media that support methanotropes)
have been proposed for closed landfills where gas collection and
management may not be feasible [175,216]. Unsuitable condi-
tions for gas management include: startup phases; post-closure times
when gas production rates dip; small sites; sites where waste com-
position issues make gas quality insufficient (too little CH4) or
inappropriate (too much contamination) for use; and sites where
forced aeration is used to reduce labile carbon (so-called MBT sites,
almost all in the EU) [212]. They may be useful adjuncts to cover
systems, as engineered controls like caps have limited lifespans
(perhaps only a few decades) [193]. At landfills with active gas
systems, augmenting soils to induce more oxidation of fugitive gases
could reduce CH4 releases by tens to hundreds of Mg yr−1 [216].

Biocovers are final caps composed of a gas permeability layer
topped by a medium designed to support methanotropes: typical-
ly compost. Biofilters are engineered media designed to support
methanotropes on packing materials. They are suitable for use over
landfill cover systems such as clay liners or geomembranes. Biofilters
can be open beds with passive gas feed to the organisms, or closed
beds with active gas feed. Composted wood chips can make good
media. Biowindows are sections of uncapped surface in an other-
wise capped landfill. They receive preferential gas flow, and have
been used in Europe to remediate old dumps. Biotarps are alter-
native daily or intermediate covers; the compost (or other media)
is a better support system for methanotropes and so improves gas

reduction rates [212]. Treated waste can also serve as a biosystem
substrate, as shown by an experiment where MBT residuals were
used as a biocover that reduced 90% of produced gas from a waste
lysimeter [218].

6. Methane gas collection, processing and utilization

In the developed world, landfills with capacity >1 MT yr−1 almost
all beneficially use produced biogas (as well as many sewage treat-
ment plants >100 ML d−1, and over 8200 US dairy and swine
operations). Feasibility is a function of revenues versus expenses
[219], tempered by regulatory requirements and government
support. In the US, LFG has been used to produce electricity (LFGTE),
fire industrial boilers, power dryers and kilns, and for green-
houses, infrared heaters, leachate evaporation, glassblowing, pottery,
blacksmithing, hydroponics and aquaculture [220].

The composition of LFG (Table 12) is primarily determined by
waste components, landfill age, and climatic conditions. Nearly all
of LFG is CH4 and CO2; there are much smaller concentrations of
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia. Usually, the gas is saturated
with water vapor, and typically contains dust particles, siloxanes,
and part-per-billion concentrations of various volatile organic com-
pounds [221]. Landfill gas is not homogenous, and the age of wastes
and the depth of collection affect important constituents [178].

As many as 116 NMOC have been measured in LFG; concentra-
tions have been decreasing at US landfills, attributed in part to more
aggressive segregation of hazardous materials from the waste
streams, and product substitutions by industry. Data from 1000 US
landfills suggested mean NMOC concentrations were less than
1000 ppm, with most regions in the US reporting mean concen-
trations less than 500 ppm. Many of these compounds are acutely
or chronically toxic, constitute hazardous air pollutants or form them
through atmospheric reactions (especially ozone), and are odorous
[178].

6.2. Gas collection systems

In order to collect gas at a landfill, a collection system must be
installed. Typically, for a system installed after the landfill has been
operating, there are a series of vertical wells drilled into the waste
to just above the liner (or bottom of the waste, as the case may be).
Screening of the wells may be continuous, at discrete intervals, or
only at one point (rarely just at the bottom, as bottom screened wells
may become flooded with leachate). The wells are fitted with valves
to allow vacuum control. At the most modern sites, variable speed
pumps controlled by a central, computerized monitoring system can
optimize collection from individual wells or over sections of the
piping network. A network of headers, often with condensate traps
to allow for collection of liquids created due to temperature change

(LFG is generally saturated, and landfills tend to be warmer than
ambient temperatures, so that moisture condenses as the gas cools),
is used to transport gas to one or more central locations. There, the
gas is either treated and then used, or used as is. Installing a cap
on the waste will increase the capture rate, and reduce incorpora-
tion of ambient air [141,222].

A planned gas collection system can be installed as a landfill is
built. In these cases, horizontal pipes are generally laid into trenches
at regular intervals as the landfill rises. The pipes are extended out
the side of the landfill. Flexible connections may be included to
account for deformation of the wastes through densification or set-
tlement of the waste mass [141].

Typically, rigid plastic piping is used. Common configurations of
the piping network are radial collection systems (a central collec-
tion point) or using a main collection pipe connected to each well;
it is common to use either the radial pattern or the main collec-
tion pipe systems in a sectorial factor, so that the systems are
modular (enabling them to be isolated for repairs, and allowing for
expansion as the site grows). Blowers and compressors are re-
quired to establish vacuum and to move gas. Regular monitoring
of each well and network of wells is important to tune gas produc-
tion optimally, both to maximize withdrawals from areas where gas
production is best, and to ensure that not too much atmospheric
gas is being captured, as well. When the landfill as a whole, or a
particular section (“cell”) of the landfill is closed, fitting the cap ma-
terial (geomembrane or clay, usually) around gas wells is a
complicating factor [141].

High leachate levels and perched water in the landfill cause gas
extraction problems. Clogging of pipes due to condensate pooling
is also an issue. Internal fires play havoc with gas systems. Corro-
sion of parts due to H2S oxidation causes part failure, as do abrasion
due to silicon and siloxanes.

Gas treatment facilities and processes are discussed below.

6.3. Gas capture efficiency

There is some controversy regarding the effectiveness of gas
control systems at landfills. One element is the rapidity with which
organic matter is converted to CH4. Some believe it is very rapid:
onset within a day or two of materials being covered, to the point
where one interpretation of data is that 50% of all available mate-
rial is converted within the first year of placement in the landfill
[99]. The other has to do with methods used to estimate CH4
generation.

The classic model for CH4 evolution, as presented above, is that

wastes take up to several years to enter mature CH4 generation.

Most estimates for CH4 generation depend on models. LandGEM
is relied on by USEPA. A key input to LandGEM is waste deposi-
tion. In the US, there has been controversy regarding the amount
of waste generation. The USEPA model is the most relied upon source
of data, but this has been criticized as being theoretically unsound
[124] and as underestimating waste disposal considerably [125,223].
Powell et al. [125] used revised estimates of disposal to re-estimate
CH4 emissions, and estimated open landfills have a collection effi-
ciency of 70% and closed landfills slightly exceed 80% efficiency.

Gas collection is a function of the landfill surface type. During
operations, a sanitary landfill has a 0.15 m soil cover (or some-
thing similar), designed to restrict vector access and absorb odors.
When filling operations are expected to stop for a lengthy but not
permanent time period, “intermediate” cover is used: 0.3 m of local
soils (or equivalent), designed to meet the vector and odor control
functions of daily cover, and to be resistant to erosion. Depending
on soil types (or the choice of alternative materials), these covers
may or may not impede gas release from the landfill. Final cover
is supposed to seal the landfill from the environment (using
clay or plastic as the main element of a cap), and should be

54

X. Chai et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 56 (2016) 33–70

impermeable to gas [224]. Older developed country dumps and land-
fills and many developing country landfills only have soil covers of
varying thickness as a final cover (cf. Ref. 163). Therefore, gas capture
efficiencies are strongly affected by the cover type. The purpose of
gas collection also affects efficiency. In the US, for regulatory com-
pliance, most but not all gas needs to be collected (allowable
concentrations are <500 ppm CH4 measured 15 cm above the land-
fill). Control processes for lateral gas migration or to prevent off-
site odors are often greater than needed, so that atmospheric gases
are collected as well as LFG. Lateral migration is often enhanced when
landfill surface soils are saturated [181], and has also been caused
when landfills are capped without an active gas control system, and
gas venting is absent or insufficient. Maximizing energy output may
require allowing some LFG to escape from collection, to avoid any
LFG dilution [224]. With all these site specific factors, it is difficult
to develop one general LFG collection efficiency value. Barlaz et al.
[224] reported on a selection of reports, and found that, using a def-
inition of efficiency that measured collection compared to modeled
gas generation, final covers generally resulted in 90%+ collection ef-
ficiency, and intermediate and other soil covers resulted in lower
collection efficiencies between 50% and 80%. A comprehensive set
of tests at three French landfills, where efficiency was determined
to range between 41% and 94%, depending on cell parameters, re-
sulted in the French government setting a 35% efficiency value for
operating cells, 85% for a cell with a clay cap, and 90% for a cell with
a geomembrane cap [102]. In the U.K., data suggested a good cap
and a well-operated gas system would be highly effective at con-
trolling emissions, reducing them by at least one (90%+) and often
two orders of magnitude (99%+), to as low as 10−4 mg m2 s−1 [174].
However, collection rates can never be 100%; there are inevitable
leaks at wells and along pipes and other installed equipment [212].
In the US, 90% of large landfills reported gas collection efficien-
cies; these ranged from 47% to 95%, and the median value was 75%
[115].

Operational policies can further limit control efficiency; plants
may not operate when collected gas is uneconomical to use, and
these times may account for up to 50% of system operations [212].
In the US, limits on O2 (5%) and N2 (20%) concentrations in gas treat-
ment systems, established for air quality purposes, limit the intensity
of collection by operators by preventing over pumping so as to in-
corporate significant amounts of atmospheric air [225].

vals. Upgrading means removing CO2 to increase the energy density
[168].

6.4.1. Hydrogen sulfide removal

Sulfur compounds are common contaminants in LFG. They are
generated both from anaerobic degradation of sulfur-bearing organic
molecules (mainly proteins) and through sulfate reduction. In land-
fills, construction and demolition debris, especially wallboard which
is largely composed of gypsum degrade with relatively large re-
leases of H2S due to sulfate reducing bacteria [226]. Hydrogen sulfide
oxidizes to sulfuric acid, and so combusting LFG containing H2S
would cause corrosion to compressors, gas storage tanks and engines,
and cause the release of sulfur oxides (“SOx”) that are considered
to be harmful air pollutants.

Standard technologies for H2S removal fall into two categories:
physicochemical and biological conversion. Physiochemical treat-
ments can further be divided by media: absorption into a liquid or
adsorption on a solid [227].

Marketed in 1890 and modified in 1936, the Claus process is the
most popular process employed for H2S removal on an industrial
scale. As a first step, H2S is partially oxidized to SO2 with air.

The main elements of Claus plant unit are a reaction furnace, two
or three catalytic reactors, and a tail gas treatment unit depend-
ing on H2S content. Many improvements of the Claus process have
been introduced since it was first introduced, and improvements
in sulfur recovery efficiency are still being sought [228].

Aside from Modified Claus technologies, many other commer-
cial applications have been developed over last hundred years. At
present, adsorption-based technologies are mostly used to reach
ultra-low sulfur levels [229]. Biological conversion is considered to
be the most economical and environmentally friendly method.
Table 13 lists several examples of modern, non-Claus technologies.

6.4. Gas clean-up

6.4.2. Other contaminants

Raw biogas from landfills is usually cleaned and upgraded for
further utilization. Water, H2S, siloxanes, and other impurities are
removed in the “cleaning” process to minimize corrosion or other
downstream problems which can double maintenance time inter-

The standard for acceptable quality depends on the end use of
the gas. Siloxanes, halogenated compounds, other trace VOCs, water,
ammonia and sometimes oxygen and nitrogen are all removed from
LFG under some conditions. Siloxanes and halogenated com-
pounds are the most harmful of these compounds when energy

recovery is the goal, especially when present at higher concentra-
tions [233].

performance [243,244]. Temperature swing adsorption can also be
applied for CO2 removal.

Siloxanes are derived from waste consumer products and are
found in almost all LFG. During combustion, siloxanes are oxi-
dized and deposit as silicon dioxide solids, causing abrasion of
mechanical moving parts. The deposits can accumulate in layers in-
hibiting conduction of heat and essential lubrication. Siloxanes are
typically removed using one of three technologies: adsorption, ab-
sorption, and deep chilling. The most widely used method is
adsorption on activated carbon [234]. Bio- and membrane filtra-
tion techniques appear promising but are not easily commercialized
[234–236]. Process configurations that minimize deposition sur-
faces also can limit siloxane impacts [219].

Halogenated compounds volatilize from the waste mass. They
will form acids on combustion [219]. Typically, larger molecules are
removed by activated carbon adsorption [237]. Many VOCs are also
removed when CO2 is treated; water removal (drying) systems (just
below) result in 99% reductions in VOCs [238].

LFG is always saturated. Water must be removed prior to end
uses. Water can be condensed by increasing the temperature or de-
creasing the pressure. Other techniques include adsorption by silica
gel, activated carbon, or aluminum oxide, and molecular sieves and
absorption in glycol solutions [237].

Ammonia is generated by degradation of nitrogen-containing or-
ganics (e.g. proteins) and nitrate reduction. It is a gas contaminant,
but its presence in LFG has beneficial aspects. During combustion
it reacts with oxidized nitrogen compounds resulting in less NOx
production. Ammonia concentrations are often reduced as a sec-
ondary byproduct of treating other contaminants, especially water
[239].

Oxygen and N2, indicative of atmospheric gases mixing with the
LFG, are contaminants of concern especially for LFG use as pipe-
line gas or when converted to vehicle fuels. Oxygen and nitrogen
can be removed by membranes, low temperature pressure swing
adsorption, and at least partially when sulfur compounds are tar-
geted. Even high-powered engines are relatively intolerant of O2 and
N2, with maximum allowable O2 being 0.5%, and combined O2—N2
being 2.5% [220]. Removing these gases is expensive. Avoiding over
pumping the landfill to minimize atmospheric gases in collected LFG
can be driven solely by cost considerations.

6.5. LFG upgrading

The Wobbe index is a common measure of upgraded gas quality,
and often is used as a standard for conversion to fuels and for pipe-
line quality gas. The Wobbe index is proportional to the methane
content of LFG. It is measured by the heat produced by combus-
tion of the gas through a defined orifice under standard temperature
and pressure conditions. Minimum Wobbe index values tend to be
18 MJ/Nm3. European standards for pipeline quality often call for
more than 40 MJ/Nm3 [239].

Removing CO2 is the most expensive part of gas treatment [237].
Costs are defined by the size of the plant and specific selected tech-
nology [240]. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and water scrubbing
have the largest market shares, although since 2009, chemical scrub-
bers (such as amine scrubber) have increased their share of the
market; membrane filtration technologies also hold promise [241].
Pressure swing adsorption causes CO2 to be adsorbed on mate-
rials such as carbon molecular sieves at elevated pressure (300–
1000 kPa); the materials are regenerated at lower pressures. Vacuum
swing adsorption, similar to PSA, has a supplementary vacuum pump
so the desorption takes place under vacuum [242]. Skarstrom-
type PSA units have four distinct treatment processes: (1) adsorption,
(2) pressurization of the feed stream, (3) more adsorption, and (4)
depressurization and desorption. New adsorbents, such as metal-
organic frameworks, are being investigated to improve PSA

Water scrubbing is the simplest means of separating CO2 from
LFG. It is based on the different binding forces between more polar
CO2 (and H2S) and non-polar CH4. It requires physical absorption in
counter-current water at high pressures, usually 700–1000 kPa, and
desorption with very little change in pressure or temperature [245].
Complete water recycling is thought to be possible when an effec-
tive under-pressure desorption system and water cooler are used,
but there are losses in removal efficiencies [238]. Organic sol-
vents, such as polyethylene glycol, can be used in place of water.
Because of higher CO2 solubility in organic solvents, the separa-
tion efficiency is greater. The trade-off is increased energy
requirement to regenerate the scrubber liquids [239]. Although H2S
can be removed simultaneously in a water scrubbing system, often
accumulating elemental sulfur plugs the pipeline.

Amine scrubbing, mainly using mono ethanol amine (MEA) and
di-methyl ethanol amine (DMEA), has been used to separate CO2
from natural gas and H2 since 1930. Heat is needed to regenerate
the amine. It has high efficiency and selectivity [246].

Membrane separation is based on the selective permeability of
membranes. Basically there are two types: dry and liquid mem-
branes. Dry membranes are commonly in the form of a hollow fiber
with a high pressure (>2000 kPa, or 800–1000 kPa) feed stream inside
and low pressure (nearly atmospheric) permeate outside the tube.
A compact module composed of many individual fibers is fed biogas.
The outlet methane content is controlled via the retentate gas pres-
sure by a proportional valve at the retentate outlet [240]. In liquid
membrane systems, a liquid absorbs the CO2 after it has perme-
ated the membrane. This technology integrates absorption and
membrane processes and can be a competitive alternative tech-
nology [247]. High selectivity of membranes, appropriate pressure,
and recirculation are required to achieve both high CH4 recovery
and high CH4 levels in the product [245,248]. The off-gas usually
also contains CH4 and should be burned to avoid emissions.

The cryogenic separation process removes CO2 by cooling and
compressing the mixture based on the difference in boiling points
at ambient pressure for CH4 (−160 °C) and CO2 (−78 °C). It is a de-
veloping technology with few commercial applications, but is gaining
more attention due to increasing production of liquefied natural gas
(LNG), as it can potentially remove impurities and liquefy the CH4
simultaneously [237,247,249].

6.6. Utilization options

One common end use for LFG is its release to the atmosphere
with severe consequences. Many closed landfills in developed coun-
tries and most fills in undeveloped countries simply allow gas to
escape to the atmosphere. This is due to a lack of collection equip-
ment availability, financial infeasibility for collection, or the inability
of collected gas to sustain combustion.

Another exercised option is to flare the gas: combust without
energy recovery. The decision to use depends on a combination of
factors – a site may be too small to support energy infrastructure,
or more acceptable options discussed in the following section are
not feasible for a variety of technical and logistic reasons. The USEPA
requires landfills that emit a certain amount of NMOC to control
those emissions to the atmosphere, and flaring is generally as-
sessed to destroy 97% or more of NMOC and CH4. Flaring is a simple
and relatively maintenance free technology [177]. In some in-
stances the waste heat can be used for beneficial purposes. One is
to evaporate or condense landfill leachate [167]. This way, two en-
vironmental hazards are concurrently addressed. A number of landfill
sites in the US supplement LFG with natural gas in order to combust
collected gas (for odor control or due to regulatory requirements)

56

if gas concentrations are too low (<20% CH4) to support good
combustion.

IEA [167] identified the major barriers to LFG use. They are as
insufficient capital, insufficient awareness of technical options among
operators and policy makers who could foster projects, and diffi-
culty establishing utility (electrical and gas) interconnections.

Final applications

for purified and upgraded biogas
(“biomethane”) are those for natural gas. It can be used to produce
electricity, combined heat and power (CHP), injected into the natural
gas grid, compressed to be vehicle fuel (CNG), processed to other
oxygenated fuels, and used to synthesize general and specialty
chemicals. Preferred end uses are generally a function of econom-
ics, which depends on regulatory support and hindrances, on the
availability of utility infrastructures, willingness of potential users
to enter into contracts, etc. On-site gas-fired power generation is
still the dominant LFG end use due to its simplicity, and the ability
of engines to utilize gas of lower quality [219,250]. On the other
hand, a comprehensive (technical/economic/environmental) anal-
ysis of different biogas utilization scenarios in Ireland found that
producing fuel with concurrent electricity generation with the
process waste heat was the best option [251]. In Italy, a study of
GHG reductions associated with various options determined that
reforming and conversion into an alternative fuel had the best result,
though the use in molten carbonate fuel cell is most energy effi-
cient [252]. For the US, a cost analysis found that pipeline gas use
was always a more profitable option than on-site electricity pro-
duction, using averaged costs; the report noted specific site factors
make the general case too simplistic for more than general guid-
ance [253]. Availability of grid connections for either electricity or
gas, the ability of biogas to be compressed and stored, site space
restrictions for processing equipment or storage vessels all affect
end-use considerations [84], as well as managerial decisions re-
garding end-use preferences. Other important issues include forecasts
of gas production to determine investment risks, settlement of waste
that can compromise piping systems, and the need to manage-
ment condensate that is generated as gases emerging from the hot
landfill (60 °C, typically) into ambient environmental conditions
[220].

6.6.1. Electricity production

The simplest end use for LFG is to produce electricity. The first
such plant in the US was installed in California in 1975 [102]. There
were nearly 1000 applications of various LFGTE projects by 2001
(Table 14) [222]. Many other projects have begun since then but there
is not a good census of projects. In most places, the number of proj-
ects has increased since the mid-2000s: tripling in the U.K. and China,
more than doubling in Germany, increasing by two-thirds in the US;
the number of plants fell slightly in Sweden, though the reason is
no clear. It is difficult to accurately count projects: the LMOP website
[254] has a data base that lists ~850 operational projects (exclud-

ing “self-sponsored” projects), but LMOP reports only 645 LFGTE
projects.

The most common technology for power generation is an inter-
nal combustion engine, sized from 100 kW to 3 MW in the US [220],
with production efficiencies of up to 43%, although 30–40% is more
common [258]. Such engines are the cheapest to obtain and operate,
are relatively mobile, but have the most emissions, and so can be
difficult to permit [220,221]; they also require relatively frequent
overhauls [80]. Smaller systems (<500 kW) became feasible in the
US with spiking fuel prices ~2011, although typically small systems
have used microturbines [259].

Other options that are used include gas turbine, organic Rankine
cycle, stirling cycle engine, molten carbonate fuel cell, and solid oxide
fuel cell. Larger plants (>800 kW) tend to use gas turbines [248],
which in the US have been sized from 800 kW to 10.5 MW [220].
Gas turbines require high pressure gases and so usually need a com-
pressor. At smaller sites, micro-turbines are becoming favored; in
the US, installations range from 30 kW to 250 kW [220]. These tend
to be simple with few moving parts and so require less mainte-
nance. Efficiency is less, partly because compressors are parasitic
loads [80]. Microturbines have been configured not only to use
smaller amounts of gas, but also gas with lower energy density [260].
The largest turbine project is a 50 MW plant that uses a steam turbine
[102]. Stirling engines were developed in the 19th Century, but gas-
oline and diesel engines were favored over them. Because they work
well with fuels with high heat capacity and have external combus-
tion, contaminants do not harm engine parts, and so they are gaining
attention as alternate means of using LFG. Molten carbonate and
solid oxide fuel cells have high capital cost; solid oxides require very
high operating temperatures (800–1000 °C), increasing operating
costs, and molten carbonate fuel cells are still a developing tech-
nology [221]. Solid oxide fuel cells have high conversion efficiencies,
but the needed catalysts are sensitive to impurities; this requires
gas upgrading, an add-on cost [248]. Electricity pricing also tends
to be more stable than other uses, which can make it more attrac-
tive, especially if financing is required [261].

An upgrade from simple electricity production is CHP. Waste heat
from the electricity production stage can be captured and used to
create steam or hot water though its use is restricted to local use
[258], though the overall energy efficiency can approach 85% [249].

6.6.2. Natural gas grid

A recent trend has been for governments to provide subsidies
to promote biogas upgrading for pipeline injection to avoid wasting
energy, such as heat produced by engines, that produce electricity
[241]. By injecting biogas directly into the grid, the gas can be trans-
ferred to a location where it has a higher value than it does locally.
In most regions, there is greater need for gas than there is local pro-
duction, so there is steady demand for fuels and grid injection [245].
Early adopters of LFG for the natural gas grid include The Nether-

lands, Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland [248]. Nine EU countries
inject biomethane into the natural gas grid [249]. The grid use can
be fostered if access is supported by regulations [248]. In order to
be accepted into the gas grid, the biogas must meet set limits for
sulfur, O2, particulates, CO2, water dew point, and, of course CH4
content [245]. The injected gas must be odorized (to detect leaks),
typically with tetrahydrothiophene (THT) or mercaptans [262] to
meet the safety guidelines.

6.6.3. CNG vehicles

If LFG meets gas grid standards, it can be compressed and used
as a vehicle fuel. Vehicles that can use CNG include buses, trucks
of various kinds including waste collection trucks, and even pas-
senger cars [245]. By 2011, over 1 million vehicles used natural gas
in Europe, with over 2800 refueling stations. Italy had the most CNG
vehicles while Germany had most CNG refueling stations. However,
in absolute terms, the numbers represented less than 0.5% cars and
trucks, and only about 1% of buses in Europe [249]. As of 2013, there
were over 100,000 CNG-powered vehicles in the US [259].

6.6.4. Renewable liquid fuels

Though electricity production dominates LFG use worldwide, it
can be transformed into liquid fuels for transportation [245]. One
of the advantages of liquid fuels end-product is the avoidance of
the forced use of LFG after its extraction, i.e., through convenient
storage as a fuel to be used or marketed with a degree of choice to
meet the projected needs and not to respond to the availability of
the gas.

All methods to convert LFG to liquid fuels go through the syn-
thesis gas (CO and H2) step. There are four principal technologies
to generate synthesis gas from LFG. These are: (1) steam reform-
ing; (2) dry (CO2) reforming; (3) partial oxidation; and (4)
autothermal reforming [263], although steam and autothermal re-
forming have been the dominant processing paths [264].

6.6.4.1. Synthesis gas production technologies. The main unit for
steam-reforming is the primary reformer, which consists of ap-
proximately 10 m long narrow tubes situated in an oven, loaded with
catalyst [265]. Steam reforming produces the highest proportion of
H2 with the least amount of CO, but is highly endothermic requir-
ing extensive heat transfer equipment and longer start-up times
[266].

The ratio of synthesis gas constituents (H2, CO, CO2, and CH4)
depends on reaction conditions such as temperature and pres-
sure, the feedstock used, reactor characteristics and residence time
to reach the equilibrium state [266]. Elevated temperatures favor
the forward reaction in Equation (19), and removing products from
the reactor can maintain the driving force for the reaction. Some
effective removal strategies are H2 removal by membrane, CO by ab-
sorbent, but this is often not economic [267].

Catalysts, based on nickel with supporting materials and pro-
moters, have been used since the 1960s to achieve higher feed
conversion and less carbon deposition [266]. Problems associated
with nickel catalysts under high temperature and pressure include
declining activity, sulfur poisoning, carbon deposition (coking) and
sintering [265]. Coking is caused by CH4 decomposition to solid
carbon and H2 or the Boudouard reaction in which CO
disproportionates to carbon and CO2 [268]. An adiabatic pre-
reformer upstream of the primary reformer can reduce the risks of
sulfur poisoning and carbon deposition [265], and effective biogas
cleanup also reduces risks of sulfur poisoning. Research targets as
alternative catalysts include zinc, activated carbon, aluminum, and
cerium, which may increase selectivity, stability and activity [267].

Dry reforming [269] can remove both CO2 and CH4 from gas
streams simultaneously. Dry reforming is also a strongly endother-
mic reaction and requires operating temperatures of 800–1000 °C
to attain high equilibrium conversion of CH4 and CO2 to H2 and CO,
and to minimize the thermodynamic driving force for carbon de-
position. It produces syngas with a lower H2/CO ratio than steam
reforming. With lower H/C ratios, there is a greater potential for
carbon formation, generally the most significant mechanism of cat-
alyst deactivation in dry reforming [266,268,270].

Dry reforming works best when the best inflow ratio of CH4/
CO2 is 1:1. Landfill gas and most AD gases also have approximately
equal CH4 to CO2 ratios, thus underscoring the feasibility of dry re-
forming for these gas streams.

Nickel-based catalysts work best in dry reforming [271]. Noble
metals like Pt, Rh and Ru are highly active and resistant to carbon
formation due to lower operating temperatures. Small amounts of
noble metals help in terms of activity, suppression of Ni oxida-
tion, carbon formation, self-activation, and sustainability in the daily
startup and shutdown operations [268,272]. Another effective way
of resisting deactivation by carbon formation is to increase pH, which
helps activate mildly acidic CO2 and assists in oxidation of surface
carbon [273].

Partial oxidation needs nearly pure oxygen to hinder side reac-

tions between nitrogen and other components [274]:

The reaction is slightly exothermic. Catalytic partial oxidation cir-
cumvents the coking problem, and has a greater selectivity to syngas
production, but requires the separation of oxygen from air and po-
tential risks of explosion [263].

Autothermal

reforming combines endothermic steam
reforming with exothermic partial oxidation reactions, separating
total oxidation and reforming [275]. A water–gas-shift (WGS)
reaction is used to adjust the H2/CO ratio for the following

The WGS and steam reforming are major reactions used for H2
production. In steam reforming, the WGS reaction departs from its
equilibrium position (CO-rich), especially at low methane conver-
sion rates [266].

6.6.4.2. Synthesis gas to liquid fuels.

6.6.4.2.1. Synthesis of hydrocarbons. Synthesis gas, produced from
any one of the methods described in Section 6.4.4.1, can be cata-
lytically converted to renewable liquid fuels. Although synthesis gas
produced from reforming is ideal to produce the ultimate gaseous
carbon-free fuel, H2, the focus of this section is liquid fuels [267].
The produced synthesis gas can be converted to liquid fuels and
chemicals, specifically, drop-in replacement hydrocarbons (diesel,
fuel), methanol, and dimethyl ether (DME)
gasoline,
[263,264,275,276].

jet

The Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) synthesis route is a long commer-
cially practiced process in which synthesis gas is converted to
hydrocarbon liquids over iron (Fe) or cobalt (Co) based catalysts at
temperatures and pressures of 200–350 °C and up to 1500 kPa
[277,278]. The hydrocarbons, produced via the F–T route, are su-
perior than conventional gasoline and diesel, since these are free
of sulfur and aromatics [279]. In terms of mechanism, the F–T re-
action is akin to polymerization, and goes through a set reaction
sequence: adsorption, chain initiation, propagation and chain growth

termination. The overall F–T routes to hydrocarbons are repre-
sented in Equations (23) and (24).

The F–T reaction is accompanied by the WGS reaction. Side re-
actions include production of oxygenates, carbide formation, and
the Boudouard reaction, the latter two negatively affects catalyst ac-
tivity over time. Both Co and Fe catalysts are very effective to yield
high per pass conversion (up to 90%) of synthesis gas. However, the
reaction is constrained in two ways: (1) the gaseous product is high
in CO2 indicating wasted carbon and (2) the overall product slate
contains a mixture of hydrocarbons that requires further upgrad-
ing to yield gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and waxes and affects process
economics. Promoters such as alkali metals and supports to anchor
Fe or Co catalysts are added to enhance performance [280].

The F–T processes can be classified either by operating temper-
ature (high temperature F–T, 300–350 °C, low temperature F–T 200–
240 °C) or reactor type (fixed-bed F–T, slurry bubble column F–T,
or circulating fluidized bed F–T). Circulating fluidized bed is mostly
applied for high temperature F–T using Fe catalyst, while fixed-
bed and slurry bubble column are usually used for low temperature
F–T using both Fe- and Co-based catalysts to produce long chain
hydrocarbons [280].

The overall F–T processing scheme consists of reactors, recy-
cling and compression of unconverted syngas, removal of H2 and
CO2, reforming of produced CH4, and separation of products [278].
Since the reactions are exothermic, process heat capture can be uti-
lized to produce electricity to offset process cost. High molecular
weight hydrocarbon products can be cracked to obtain liquid fuel
in the C6–C18 range [281].

6.6.4.2.2. Synthesis of oxygenates. Conversion of synthesis gas to
oxygenates such as methanol (methyl alcohol), dimethyl ether (DME),
and higher alcohols (typically C1–C6), is another route to synthe-
sis gas utilization. This class of products is gaining interest due to
their clean burning properties. Methanol, a common solvent, is a
versatile feedstock for production of formaldehyde, ethylene, pro-
pylene and fuels such as DME. Methanol synthesis is well developed
since 1960s when a lower pressure process (less than 10,000 kPa)
based on commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was introduced [263].
Other oxides such as ZnO/Cr2O3, V2O5, V2O3, and ThO2 are also ef-
fective supports or promoters of Cu-based low-pressure methanol
synthesis catalysts [282]. As for methanol, the reaction:

H CO CH OH
2 2

+ →

(25)

is exothermic and is carried out in two-phase reactors with syn-
thesis gas and products in the vapor phase and the catalyst in the
solid phase. Optimal reaction temperatures are limited by the in-
herent low heat capacity of vapor and large reaction heat. A liquid-
phase methanol synthesis process based on CO2 hydrogenation
reaction and the forward WGS reaction was first developed by Chem
Systems in the late 1970s [283].

DME (CH3OCH3) is a volatile organic compound (VOC) but is con-
sidered environmentally benign when used as a fuel. Because it has
very low particulate emissions when combusted and contains no
sulfur compounds, it is viewed as a potential “fuel for the 21st
century” [275,284], and can be used as an efficient H2 carrier for
fuel cells and other applications [285]. It has physical properties that
are similar to liquefied natural gas (LNG), and so DME could use the
existing land-based and ocean-based LNG infrastructure with minor
modification, which decreases investment requirements for its trans-
portation and storage [275]. The first presentation of neat DME as

a diesel fuel appeared in 1995. Compared with traditional diesel,
DME fueled engines generate less noise, and emit fewer pollut-
ants (particulates, NOx, hydrocarbons, and CO). However, it has a
lower energy density than diesel, so a double-sized tank is needed
to maintain similar travel range [286]. DME engines have certain
special requirements: a vapor pressure of 510 kPa at 25 °C, low vis-
cosity and lubricity, with compressibility rising near full load
conditions. These require improved seals and the lubrication, issues
that are not as significant in stationary engine applications [287].
DME is usually produced in a two-step process: syngas to meth-
anol, and methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether [275]. This is a
mature technology, commercialized by companies like Haldor Topsøe
A/S, Toyo Engineering Ltd., Air Liquide, S.A. and JFE Holding Inc. [288].

The reaction for methanol dehydration is:

CH OH CH OCH H O

(26)

The reverse WGS accompanies this reaction. The yields of CO by
reverse WGS reaction should be kept to a minimum to maximize
productivity [285].

The conversion of syngas to methanol and to DME in the same
reactor frees the process from the thermodynamic equilibrium con-
straint of methanol synthesis alone. The best syngas composition
for methanol synthesis is a H2/CO ratio of 2:1, but methanol dehy-
dration should be CO-rich. In a single reactor, synergy can be obtained
among methanol synthesis, methanol dehydration, and WGS. By re-
cycling methanol and water along with the unconverted syngas, the
overall reaction can be achieved as follows:

The productivity and material utilization in a one-step syngas-
to-DME reactor with recycle depends strongly on the feed gas
composition [276]. This reaction has low carbon utilization, due to
one-third of the carbon in the syngas lost to CO2.

The one-step reactor requires a bifunctional hybrid DME syn-
thesis catalyst, consisting of a methanol synthesis catalyst (such as
CuO—ZnO, CuO—ZnO—Al2O3, CuO—ZnO—CrO3, or CuO—TiO2—ZrO2),
and a methanol dehydration catalyst (such as γ-alumina and ZSM-5
zeolite). Preventing the aggregation of Cu active sites and preserv-
ing catalyst structure are key factors to obtain higher activity and
DME selectivity with hybrid catalysts [285].

Higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) is another option to utilize syn-
thesis gas. The use of high octane higher alcohols or mixed alcohols
(C1–C4 alcohols) as a fuel or fuel-additive continues to attract at-
tention [289–292]. In early twentieth century, non-selective ZnO/
Cr2O3 catalysts promoted by alkali were used for higher alcohol
synthesis, producing large amounts of hydrocarbons. In 1980s, much
more active and selective Cu/ZnO catalysts promoted by heavy alkali
were developed [292]. The alkali-promoted transition metal sulfide
catalysts, particularly disulfide molybdenum (MoS2), have been ex-
tensively studied, but are associated with low space–time–yield and
poor selectivity at high temperatures where these catalysts are active
[289,291]. Studies continue to increase productivity and selectiv-
ity to match those needed for commercial operation [289,291,293].
So far, this section briefly described pathways to utilize puri-
fied landfill gas for renewable electricity and fuels production.
However, the challenge is “economy of scale” and all known routes,
F–T, methanol, HAS, DME, discussed herein, face formidable chal-
lenges to implementation when LFG is considered as feedstocks at
available scales (less than 300 cubic meters). The challenge to use
small gas sources has spawned new niche industry, namely mini-
gas-to-liquids (GTL) plants. The World Bank Group has been actively
sponsoring studies in this area but with a focus on flared gas that
normally mirrors LFG range. It is interesting to note that 400 bcm
of natural gas is annually flared during oil and gas operations – this
gas is equivalent to 750 billion kWh or 500 million barrels per year

of oil. A recent report provides a comprehensive review of upcom-
ing mini-GTL projects [294], which could be implemented at landfills.

6.7. Economics of landfill gas utilization

The economics of landfill gas utilization projects are not simple;
each site has specific aspects that either make projects cheaper or
more expensive. Extraction of gas is obviously an essential element
– but many landfills already capture gas to prevent odor releases,
so the extraction of gas may not be a distinct cost for the project.
Many collection fleets are being converted to CNG trucks, and since
collection vehicles eventually go to disposal sites, many fleet re-
filling stations are being located at landfills (the existing land use
also means the CNG station is not viewed as an incompatible op-
eration for the area). Therefore, certain projects have existing onsite
natural gas pipelines, and only need interconnections or minor ex-
tensions for gas to be shipped into the grid. Similarly, depending
on surrounding land use or onsite accessory functions, the electri-
cal connections for the site may be sparse (many landfills are located
away from neighbors that might object to waste disposal activi-
ties), or the need for electricity to power other activities may mean
a robust grid connection already exists, and so electrical genera-
tion from a LFGTE plant may be easily accommodated. Given site
characteristics, and typical market uncertainties, then the site owner
must determine whether to accept the project risk and supply tech-
nical skills necessary to complete the project, or to engage a site
developer (so-called second-party developer) to provide those re-
sources. The landfill owner will then forego the potential for most
revenue from any resulting project [295].

In 2013, a “typical 3-MW, 15-year” project was estimated to cost
$5.2 M for electrical equipment ($500,000 in operations and main-
tenance (O&M)). Accessing the natural gas grid was thought to
require a pipeline interconnection at $2.7 M capital cost (5 mi pipe-
line, 800 scfm) and $112,000 for O&M. Accessing the natural gas
grid requires onsite upgrading of gas quality [296]. Electricity sales
(assuming 95% availability) would be $2.5 M yr−1 at 10 cents kWh−1
and $750,000 at 3 cents kWh−1. The value of the gas would be
$1.6 M yr−1 at $4 MMBtu−1 and $600,000 yr−1 at $1.50 MMBtu−1. The
cost of upgrading gas can be substantial. One estimate of the range
of capital costs for removal of water, H2S, CO2, and NMOC was $1700
scfm−1 of capacity (for a 5000 scfm unit) to about $8500 scfm−1 of
capacity (for a 50 scfm unit); O&M costs would add $250–$350 scfm−1
of capacity more [297]; EESI [298] estimated costs to be much less,
with capital costs for NMOC treatment at less than $1000 scfm−1,
and annual O&M costs at $90 scfm−1.

Markets in other settings bring additional factors to bear. In the
EU, renewable gas is subsidized, as it is to some degree in China (see
Section 7 below). Creating a source of electricity with 95% reliabil-
ity would be tremendously beneficial in those burgeoning megacities
without extensive utility infrastructure (Lagos, Manila, Kolkata,
among others), and so economic viability in such settings may not
be as important, as the service that is needed would be supported
in order to create needed services.

Some believe that the creation of liquid fuels will ultimately prove
to be the greatest value added product (e.g. Ref. 299). Not only do
liquid fuels potentially have the greatest return per unit energy, and
are also nearly as versatile in end-use as electricity, but they are
more easily stored than electricity. The ability to store fuels and
choose when to market or use them makes them more valuable than
electricity even if returns on investment are similar, and recent low
prices for pipeline gas seem to imply better returns are possible for
liquid fuels [300].

One added US element in landfill gas economics is the poten-
tial to access low-carbon fuel standard credits from California.
California, to minimize the environmental impact of its use of over
50 B L of gasoline and more than 10 B L of diesel fuel each year,

has instituted a program where the 155 companies that provide
transportation fuels in the state (as of 2014) must reduce “carbon
intensity,” as measured in g CO2eq MJ−1. Each fuel type is given a value
through a life cycle assessment of its production, transportation and
use. The sale of fuel types by the companies generates credits if the
carbon intensity is less than the standard, and deficits when greater
than the standard. Each company is proportioned a required amount
of credits each year based on in-state sales. The companies then
either manufacture or purchase fuels that generate sufficient credits
(extra credits can be carried over for future applications); as of 2014,
440 transactions had been recorded, at values of $10–$85 MT CO2eq−1
(frozen at $27 MT CO2eq−1 by a law suit in 2013). Most credits have
been from ethanol (60%) or renewable or biodiesel (28%), but 10%
were from renewable natural gas used as transportation fuel [301].
Generators of renewable natural gas (such as some landfill gas) that
can demonstrate it is technically possible to ship their gas to Cal-
ifornia (a route from the generating site to the potential end user
can be completed) can access this market. At $27 MT CO2eq−1, the
value of a kW equivalent of natural gas is worth several dollars (as
opposed to ten cents or less kWh−1 as electricity, or 1–60 cents kwh−1
as a Renewable Energy Certificate) [296]. It is not clear if this market
will have persistence or not.

7. Policy considerations associated with landfill gas use

Shindell et al. [302] screened over 400 existing pollution control
measures to determine potential worldwide emissions reductions
of particulate and gaseous species, and selected measures that
reduced climate change and improved human health. The CH4 mit-
igation measures have large climate change impacts, greater than
controls on black carbon emissions, but little effect on human health.
They note that many other policies can reduce CH4 emissions other
than those selected by their criteria, and that CH4 reductions provide
strong short-term mitigation of climate change, but much have much
smaller effects on long-term climate change (which is controlled
more by CO2 releases). van der Berg et al. [303] appeared to agree
on CH4 abatements’ greater short-term impact (compared to CO2),
as their analysis of changes in IPCC GWP factors showed 25 year
horizon computations had greater relative benefits for CH4 emis-
sion controls compared to CO2 mitigation, but a 500 yr horizon
showed more benefits accruing to CO2 control.

In the last decade, new sources of natural gas have been ex-
ploited with the availability of hydraulic fracturing technologies. A
comparison of five different models of demand effects, assuming
estimates of extractable reservoirs are accurate, found that in-
creased use of natural gas had no discernible impact of overall CO2
(and CO2e) releases through 2050. The model found gas will replace
coal for electricity production, but was forecast to have little to no
impact on transportation. The effect is seen because natural gas will
also displace demand for renewable energy sources, and abun-
dant gas will accelerate the global economy [76]. The impact could
be negative if assessments that find hydraulic fracturing cause more
CO2 releases than it prevents are accurate [22]. Still, because of the
short atmospheric residence time for CH4 (especially relative to CO2),
many assessments assert that changes in fugitive CH4 quantities can
have more immediate effects than other GHG reductions [77].

If there is a technology change, and CH4 is used to replace other
GHG-releasing technologies – for instance, to power vehicles – the
impact may be negative at first before benefits over current con-
ditions are realized. This is due to increases in leakage from the
natural gas pipeline network, so that radiative forcing would be in-
creased for 80 years (replacing gasoline vehicles) or 280 years
(replacing diesel vehicles) before the greater efficiency of natural
gas use leading to lower CO2 emissions would offset the short-
term impact of greater CH4 releases [304].

60

X. Chai et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 56 (2016) 33–70

Murray et al. [253] point out that increasing end uses and the
potential to continue increasing gas supplies through hydraulic frac-
turing or other technological changes makes accurate price predictions
difficult. Good understanding of future markets for recovered gas
is important to make sound decisions regarding technology choices
and end markets. Higher air pollution control requirements make
natural gas a much better choice than other fossil fuels, due to greater
efficiencies, lower particulate generation, and generally lower acid
gas formation rates, and could also boost demand.

Emissions allowances and carbon trading have been identified
as a means of monetizing GHG reductions. These markets have not
had great success to date. California has had an emission trading
program, with prices varying from $10 to $16 T−1 CO2e, but toward
the lower end of that range as of 2013; the floor price is $10 T−1 CO2e.
In the EU, prices reached $40 T−1 CO2e in 2008, but the market col-
lapsed with a drop in demand due to the global recession, and did
not recover [253].

Given difficulties in assessing current landfill emissions of CH4
with great accuracy, it is perhaps more difficult to create a credi-
ble forecast of future releases. One estimate suggests they will double
by 2030. This estimate was based on the use of forecasts of energy
consumption to estimate MSW generation (assuming energy use
is a proxy for materials use and general economic activity), and, based
on trends from the early 2000s, estimated the amounts of waste
that might be diverted from landfilling by recycling and waste-to-
energy incineration, and also tried to forecast the future capture of
CH4 at landfills [100]. The results that were reported are obviously
speculative.

A British cost-benefit analysis found that the greatest impact on
national LFG release rates comes from capping and installing gas
control system at the largest CH4 sources. Depth of waste rather than
landfill surface area is a better indicator of CH4 production capa-
bility. Installing a flare cost only 10% the cost of a cap, and for most
small sites a cap was not cost-effective considering the potential re-
duction in CH4 emissions, and that the UK could meet its short-
term CH4 reduction goals without controlling gas from these sites
[174]. In addition, some have called landfill gas control “technical-
ly difficult and costly” [193]. However, there can be synergies when
LFGTE projects are considered. One Thailand landfill forecast cap-
turing only 10% of generated gas through a collection system, but
displacing fossil fuel electricity by LFG electricity increased the value
of captured gas four times, to the equivalent of achieving a 40%
capture rate [305].

Currently there is no means to account for “social” costs asso-
ciated with GHG emissions in general, and LFG impacts in particular.
Jaramillo and Matthews [306] assessed effects such as offsets to
primary air pollutants and determined there could be substantial
benefits, if these could be monetized. In addition, many risk as-
sessments of pollution decreases find that human health benefits
are often substantial, and these considerations are included in risk–
benefit assessments of proposed regulations (e.g. Ref. 307); but that
is not monetizing them for the benefit of project developers.

The sum effect of these and similar reports appear to make the
twin goals of greater exploitation of renewable sources of CH4 and
reductions in easily stopped fugitive CH4 necessary. van Foreest [249]
forecasts slow increases in biomethane production in Europe, but
thought it could comprise as much as 10–20% of current natural
gas use there, potentially by 2030. And economic analyses by the
Global Methane Initiative [308] find that landfill emission reduc-
tions of 30% are feasible and relatively affordable, and reductions
as great as 72% are achievable with current technologies and rep-
resent the most economical fugitive gas reductions available.

However, for India, IEA [134] assumes that because so much waste
is food waste which rapidly decays, only the largest landfills will
be able to support gas projects. The small waste generation rate gen-
erally reported for India means this report forecasted that only the

ten largest cities could support landfills of an appropriate size.
However, it is not clear that anything approaching accurate waste
generation data are collected in India, or that food waste necessar-
ily decays as swiftly in India landfills as is assumed by IEA. In
addition, growing affluence is likely to alter waste generation pat-
terns in India. Thus, it is difficult to place great reliance on broad
assessments of what should probably be local, situational analyses.
If gas collection and control are not to be utilized for any reason,
Huber-Humer et al. [212] recommend that various bio-engineered
structures be installed on landfills. These promote the growth of
methanotropes and therefore minimize CH4 emissions. In devel-
oping countries and for old landfills, degasification is often too costly
to consider [193]. Another control is to limit the input of organic
material, through organic material landfilling bans [158,309], or, as
in the EU, requiring treatment to make carbon-containing com-
pounds less labile (see below). India, for instance, banned organic
matter from landfills in 2000, with the intention of reducing fugi-
tive CH4. This would have required a major restructuring of India’s
somewhat undeveloped waste management system. No signifi-
cant support was provided to implement the ban and required
changes, and so no noticeable effect was seen in waste manage-
ment practices [167].

Brandt et al. [63] note that the imprecision and inaccuracy of CH4
assessments mean that policies targeting certain sectors or sources
for overall GHG reduction, economical, or efficiency reasons may
be flawed, as the basis for the prescription is unlikely to be well de-
scribed. Note that the range of credible landfill CH4 emissions
collected by Huber-Humer et al. [212] was 35–70 Tg yr−1 (the widest
we were able to find). These uncertainties concerning the scope of
the problem suggest that better activities addressing fugitive CH4
will need to be able to stand on their own rights – that while un-
derstanding the context and intended larger impact of actions is
important to set broad goals, particular projects should be set in
the realities of local economics, needs, and purposes.

IEA [167] identifies a lack of capital, ignorance of opportunities
by decision-makers, and some technical issues, such as intercon-
nections to utilities, as being the primary barriers to LFG projects
worldwide. Capital shortcomings can be partially addressed through
financial policies, such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and relief,
power purchase requirements and incentives that reduce costs or
enhance revenues for site operators. Interconnection issues can be
addressed through policies that require renewable energy connec-
tions, or that may standardize regulations that may favor one
provider over another. Net metering at one site or across an owner’s
multiple sites can provide fiscal relief, too. And government direc-
tion and education can foster behaviors by providing information
that is useful and pertinent to potential project developers. This can
include sponsoring demonstration projects.

For those purposes, we now review existing government poli-
cies that address reductions in landfill gas emissions, and support
the use of captured gas in the US and China, and also discuss other
notable initiatives from the EU.

7.1. US policies

Methane emissions in the United States have declined by 11%
since 1990. However without further action, these levels are fore-
cast to increase to ~25 Tg yr−1 by 2030 [310].

The Obama administration announced intent to reduce CH4 emis-
sions in its 2014 “Climate Action Plan.” As part of the implementation
of the plan, USEPA proposed in August 2015 to reduce oil and gas
sector CH4 emissions 40–45% by 2025 (from 2012 levels). The plan
focuses on leaks, and to reduce and capture gas along the produc-
tion pathway at pumps and pipelines and at closed facilities. The
gas and oil sector plan is to be coupled with existing, voluntary pro-
grams: the Methane Challenge Program, the Coalbed Methane

61

Outreach Program (CMOP), the AgSTAR Program, and the Landfill
Methane Outreach Program (LMOP). The Methane Challenge program
is part of “Natural Gas Star,” which encourages, supports, and rec-
ognizes companies that are making ambitious improvements in
reducing methane emissions. CMOP was formed to address barri-
ers to using coal mine CH4 (to reduce releases to the atmosphere).
The AgSTAR Program in 2014 combined US Department of Agri-
culture, USEPA, and US Department of Energy efforts to produce a
“Biogas Opportunities Roadmap.” This outlined government support
for research, investments, markets, and communication for the biogas
industry, with a focus to reduce methane emissions from the ag-
ricultural sector while increasing energy independence, and to supply
biogas projects with feedstocks [310].

In 1991, USEPA proposed emissions guidelines for existing land-
fills and New Source Performance Standards for new landfills under
its authority granted under the Clean Air Act. The regulations were
promulgated in 1996, and affected sites that released 50 Mg yr−1 of
NMOC. LFG is the carrier medium for the NMOC to the atmo-
sphere; NMOC are regulated under the Clean Air Act, but LFG itself
is not. However, because LFG control leads to NMOC control, LFG
became the target of the regulation. Affected landfills included all
sites with capacity of 2.5 million Mg or 2.5 million m3, and sites
under that capacity that modeled emissions of NMOC above the
50 Mg yr−1 standard. The regulation required gas collection systems
and reduction of NMOC by 98%. Combustion of LFG was the gen-
erally identified means to meet the standard; sale of gas into
pipelines or for other purposes was allowed, as long as gas clean-
up did not release NMOC to the atmosphere. Gas had to be collected
from active cells within five years of waste placement and from all
closed cells [146]. In 2000, USEPA proposed National Emission Stan-
dards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for MSW landfills (65
FR 66672). The rule was finalized in 2003 (66 FR 2227). The rule
added monitoring and reporting requirements, and modified regu-
lations regarding process upsets and for bioreactor landfills. It
required the emission control devices to be governed by “MACT”
– maximum available control technology. This means the landfill
emission controls must be as good as if not better than the devices
that obtained the highest control of relevant air pollutants. In 2015,
USEPA proposed amendments to these rules, which primarily focused
on including smaller sites under the rules by dropping the limit of
NMOC to 34 Mg yr−1. The new rule also called for increased (quar-
terly) surface monitoring. Closed landfills that do not produce much
CH4 would be exempted from the requirement to control gas emis-
sions [311].

The US Greenhouse Gas Reporting rule, created in response to
requests by IPCC, was set in place in 2009 (Final Rule 74 FR 56260).
It required landfills emitting 25,000 T CO2e yr−1 to report data an-
nually to USEPA, which covered approximately 1200 landfills [125].
The US Renewable Fuel Standard (authorized in 2005 and ex-
panded in 2007) requires over 100 billion L of renewable fuels by
2022; biogas from landfills qualifies as cellulosic biofuel (RIN D-code
3 if used as CNG, RIN D-code 7 if converted to a biodiesel) [312].
Renewable fuels, under the standard, must create fewer GHGs as
measured by a Life Cycle Analysis (at least 20% less, generally, but
more for certain applications). Biodiesel counts 50% more than
ethanol and CNG (eCFR Title 40, Chapter I, Subchapter C Part 80
Subpart M). This rule creates a large impetus for LFG-to-fuel con-
versions [259].

In 2008, the Energy Improvement Act gave public entities (mostly
local governments) the ability to issue tax credits in place of paying
interest as a financing mechanism for renewable energy projects,
including LFG projects. This program was expanded in the Ameri-
can Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) [313]. The Renewable
Energy Production Incentive is a pricing incentive offered since 1992.
It is currently $0.009 kW hr−1 [314]. Various states offer their own
production incentives [221].

In 1994, USEPA created the Landfill Methane Outreach Program
(LMOP) to expand use of LFG. LMOP not only promotes projects, but
also assists site managers in complying with US regulations, as they
are developed and revised [306]. A total of 580 LFGTE projects have
been established in the last 18 years with the assistance of LMOP;
the total CH4 emission reduction is estimated at 8.6 Tg [310]. In 2015,
USEPA released proposals to further reduce landfill CH4 emissions
by 440,000 T yr−1 by 2025 [311]. LMOP has expanded its program
beyond US borders through the Methane to Markets Partnership in
2004 (the Global Methane Initiative). Partly this is a technology trans-
fer activity, promoting US consultants and technology providers, and
creating greater energy security and economic growth in the part-
nership countries, but it is also an effort by the US to create global
awareness of the potential to reduce landfilling impacts on the en-
vironment [306].

The Global Methane Initiative is a voluntary consortium of 43
countries. Each member is requested to prepare an action plan.
Action plans are suggested to include a CH4 inventory, objectives
and planned initiatives, participants in CH4 generation and abate-
ment, plans to promote reductions, and challenges to achieving any
reductions [315]. Table 15 lists participation in some major ele-
ments of the MSW portion of the initiative (which focuses on
landfills). Projects, which can range from specific machinery at

landfill sites to whole landfill gas projects, are listed in a database,
which provides inconsistent details regarding the site and the ac-
tivities, and also links to any project reports. An interactive map is
also available for each country, and these maps often show more
projects than listed in the data base. The map supports a link to the
data base, even if the direct search of the data base disclosed no
available information.

IEA [167] attributes the growth of LFG projects in the US to the
continuing expansion of the “Landfill Rule.” However, the energy
opportunity afforded by LFG also has been an important factor.

Individual state policies can be important, such as including LFG
use in Renewable Portfolio Standards or Renewable Portfolio Goals,
and providing loans, incentives, and tax credits [167]. A number of
states have established restrictions on inputs to landfills. Yard wastes
are mostly commonly banned, but other states are restricting food
waste landfilling. Many of these programs are not explicitly de-
signed to reduce CH4 releases, but rather seek to promote composting
and generally increase diversion-recycling rates [309].

7.2. China policies

China now accounts for 28% of the annual global CO2 emis-
sions and deserves special attention. The development of heavy
industry created environmental problems in China in the 1950s, and
social and political instabilities during the Cultural Revolution (1966–
1976) exacerbated these issues. Economic reforms that began in the
mid-1970s resulted in very fast development and urbanization, cre-
ating new kinds of environmental impacts. Laws and regulations
to protect the environment were adopted beginning in 1973, and
in 1983 environmental protection was identified as a state “fun-
damental policy.” Most regulations in the 1980s were traditional
“end-of-pipe” restrictions on pollutant releases. In the 1990s, pro-
grams adopted a more flexible approach, based on sustainability
principles. In 2005, the major law relating to solid waste manage-
ment was adopted, as was a major piece of legislation targeting
renewable energy [128].

China is a member of the Global Methane Initiative, and as such
has been involved in its policy exploration and technical guidance
that seek to reduce fugitive CH4 and increase beneficial use of avail-
able CH4 [127].

China has continued to target CH4 emissions in the 12th five year
plan (2011–2015), primarily through increased research on and uti-
lization of coal bed and coal mine CH4. Under the policy, China aims
to capture an additional 1 trillion m3 of coal-based CH4 between 2012
and 2015, potentially reducing overall GHG emissions by 990 MT
CO2e during the planning period. The plan does recognize that LFGTE
projects in western areas should be promoted [250].

Coal mine methane emission control is a China success story. No
coal CH4 was captured prior to the 1990s; currently, China has nearly
half of the world’s coal mine CH4 recovery projects, with more than
25% of captured gas being used for electricity production. These proj-
ects were strongly supported with assistance from USEPA and the
UN, and fostered China participation in the Global Methane Initia-
tive [75,127].

In 2005, the People’s Congress passed the “Renewable Energy
Law of the People’s Republic of China” (effective in 2006). It stressed
the development of wind and solar projects. It was amended in 2009.
The law mandates purchase of waste-to-energy electricity by utili-
ties, and funds projects both through the national budget but also
through fees destined to be allocated to utilities to cover costs as-
sociated with grid connection and other costs of renewable power
sources. In 2013, the State grid issued a formal statement recog-
nizing the necessity of incorporating waste-to-energy electricity into
the grid [250].

centers to use “safe” facilities (see just below) to manage 80% of
wastes by 2015 (with the goal being to approach 100%). “Resource
utilization” (recycling and energy recovery) should be 30% by 2015,
with a goal of 50%. The 2011 5-year Plan for Environmental Pro-
tection also identifies benefits from LFGTE [250].

Federal laws establish principles of management and pollution
control. States set standards for pollutant control. Waste manage-
ment implementation is a function of local government. Disposal
sites, collection programs, scope of recycling – all are determined
and funded by local governments [128].

Because of rapid urbanization and growing affluence, China is
experiencing an explosion in the amount of managed MSW. One
account is it grew from 31 MT in 1980 to 180 MT in 2011, and could
more than double again to 480 MT by 2030. The World Bank de-
termined China was the world’s largest generator of MSW in 2003
[110]. Additionally, China is facing an energy problem; sufficient coal
exists to meet energy needs, but coal has high GHG impacts. Al-
ternative energy sources are therefore attractive, and MSW offers
several ways to generate energy (primarily waste-to-energy incin-
eration, and LFGTE) [250].

Landfills are the primary means of waste disposal in China. Less
than 2% of MSW may have been landfilled before 1990, with the
remainder going to dumps; urban management rates approached
65% by 1999 with 700 disposal facilities, 200 of them “harmless”
treatment plants. The number of “safe” facilities (sanitary land-
fills, compost sites, and approved incinerators) reached 677 by 2011,
accounting for 80% of urban MSW. However, composting is falling
out of favor, perceived as being expensive, difficult to conduct well,
and producing a low value product in that soil amendments have
much less utility than fertilizers, and the produced MSW compost
is often physically contaminated by glass, metal, and plastic. Incin-
eration has grown by an order of magnitude from 2003 to 2011, with
the number of plants doubling to 109, with an astonishing 45 plants
coming on line in 2012. However, waste-to-energy incineration only
accounted for 16% of 2011 MSW [250]. There were 498 landfills in
China in 2010; many of the new landfills use HDPE liners, compact
wastes, and some sites near the larger cities collect and use LFG [128].
The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Construction scores
sanitary landfills. A score of 85 or better is Class I, and between 70
and 85 is Class II. Below 70 is Class III, according to the 2005 Stan-
dard of Assessment on Non-hazardous Disposal of Municipal Solid
Waste (CJJ/T107-2005). The first assessment was completed in 2005,
and another in 2008. In 2008, the standard was amended (GB16889-
2008) to require CH4 control at landfills with a capacity >2.5MT, and
a depth of waste >20 m. Flaring collected gas will meet the stan-
dard [130]. To promote renewable energy, in 2006 the State
Commission set subsidies (0.25 Yuan kW−1 more than coal electric-
ity) for biomass-based renewable energy such as from LFG. Under
the Renewable Energy Law of 2006, electric companies must pur-
chase renewable energy and provide interconnections to the grid.
Although LFGTE was pioneered before these laws (the first LFGTE
plant was operational in 1998 [168]), as of 2008, 28 landfills were
collecting gas, with 20 generating electricity or conducting some
other kind of beneficial use. There were an additional 29 ap-
proved LFG proposals [130] (plants require an environmental
assessment, a power use feasibility plan, and local government ap-
provals [166]). By 2012, there were 50 operating plants, more than
doubling the number of plants and the electrical capacity since 2007
[250].

China has created a classification of “environmental protection
model cities” (“eco-cities”). One standard is that disposal rates for
MSW at proper facilities must exceed 85%. This competition has
created models for sustainable development, making urban envi-
ronments “cleaner and tidier” [250].

In 2011, the State Council passed the “Opinions on Further
Strengthening the Work of MSW Disposal.” This requires urban

organic fraction than MSW from developed countries, it is impor-

tant to develop efficient and effective gas controls as new sanitary
landfills are constructed. The gas control will not only limit CH4 emis-
sions, but also reduce complaints about “malodorous” conditions
associated with China landfills. Brink et al. [127] also identified ad-
dressing growing waste generation and landfilling rates as key to
mitigating future CH4 emissions. Xu [130] however suggested the
need for expanding basic waste management services will result
in a large number of small landfills (<200 T d−1). The small size of
these sites is further affected by the high proportion of food waste.
A lot of food waste is believed to limit the duration of gas gener-
ation, with standard theory being that food wastes all degrade
rapidly. Thus, the feasibility of gas capture and use appears limited.
Aerobic bioreactors were identified as a means of limiting CH4 re-
leases. Other alternatives to LFGTE include using aged MSW as cover
material to promote CH4 oxidation, and also to treat vent pipes with
a “wind–heat-bacteria” system that also can promote oxidation.
Another proposal is to poison landfills with chlorinated hydrocar-
bons with the intention of inhibiting methanogenesis [128]. In
addition, Zheng et al. [250] believe that, for large east coast cities,
there is no land available for landfilling; sites will need to be con-
structed far from the urban centers, making transportation costs and
associated pollution worse, and also requiring transmission of pro-
duced electricity. This is recognized in a series of plans issued by
the State Council, and the National Energy Council from 2011 to 2013,
which all gave preference to waste-to-energy incineration in eastern
cities, and determined LFGTE should be emphasized in the west
where large landfills will continue to be used. In addition, while in-
cineration plants benefit from feed-in tariffs and base price supports,
LFGTE projects have no such benefits; they do receive an immedi-
ate refund of VAT, however [250].

Brink et al. [127] suggest a waste management focus on urban
areas. Their analysis suggests that greater reductions in fugitive CH4
will result there because as more waste is landfilled, waste man-
agement generally will become more cost effective (less expense
for transportation, more scalable opportunities for infrastructure
costs). However, if rural areas gain organized waste management,
less sophisticated technology opportunities will probably lead to
less CH4 control. Brink et al. would also like to see household biogas
initiatives re-invigorated for rural areas, which can serve as an al-
ternative to waste disposal, although Bond and Templeton [316] have
reviewed the promise and poor performance of these systems in
India and China. In Asia (especially India and China), there has been
a long history of small, household- to neighborhood-sized AD plants
[317]. Expanded use of these plants began in the 1970s in China
when 7 million plants were constructed. In the 2000s, another 20
million plants were installed. In India, over 7 million plants have
been installed or are planned for. They manage animal manures pri-
marily, but also can be connected so as to treat domestic wastewater
and other organic wastes. Although decentralized production of
biogas, especially to replace the use of biomass for cooking, but also
for household heating and illumination, and even electricity gen-
eration, is very attractive in rural areas otherwise devoid of modern
infrastructure, the technology has not flourished. Owners and pre-
sumed operators of the plants were not adequately trained to run
these plants, nor were any mechanisms for maintenance (spare parts,
etc.) ever provided. Costs for plants are enormous compared to
household cash incomes in rural, undeveloped areas, and so sub-
sidies are a necessity for construction, and financing for system
maintenance, even if the know-how had been transferred, is also
difficult to accommodate. At least 50% of installed plants from the
first wave of China construction are inoperable, and data from other
Asia locales are not very different (unless only recently con-
structed plants are included in the assessments) [316].

China joined the CDM process in 2005, and as of 2013 ac-
counted for over 50% of the CDM projects, and over 60% of the CERs.
Although most China CDM projects are in wind and hydropower,

waste to energy is a focus. The number of LFGTE projects certified
by the China NRDC has ranged from 3 to 14 (8 were registered in
2012), with UNFCC registrations ranging from 1 to 11 (11 were reg-
istered in 2012). About twice as many incineration plants are
registered with both agencies [250]. However, mandating gas control
may mean future LFG projects are not eligible for CDM credits, as
CERs are only issued if the project was not required – there must
be an element of voluntary adoption of the behavior being re-
warded [167].

CDM affects perspectives on potential projects. One analysis com-
pared using LFG as pipeline gas or to produce electricity (at three
different collection efficiencies). Greater relative gas utilization (mea-
sured as thermal energy) was realized by creating electricity, but
the GHG credits were greater to use the gas in the pipeline, making
this a better choice. However, electricity and gas grid pricing mean
that capture of at least 65% of the landfill’s gas is necessary to make
the project cost-effective. CDM credits could make either kind of
project feasible at lower capture rates [318]. However, in order for
CDM credits to be earned by a project, a precise and particular project
development process must be followed, and one year of post project
monitoring is required to validate the emission reductions [141].

7.3. Policies in the EU

The European Union (EU) and individual member states have a
number of policies which target MSW and CH4 emissions. In
Germany, for instance, the Renewable Energy Sources Act of 2004
provided feed in tariffs and a 20 year guaranteed price for renew-
able sourced electricity. This included CH4 sources such as biomass
digestion, coal mines and LFG. The U.K. was one of the first nations
to sign on to the Kyoto Protocol, signaling early and strong support
for climate change policy, and the U.K. has strong requirements for
renewable energy use. Between 1990 and 2002, CH4 levels in the
U.K. dropped by 43%. One tax policy was to exclude renewable energy
sources from a “Climate Change Levy” to provide them with a com-
petitive advantage in the energy markets. The U.K. also provides feed-
in tariffs for biomethane. The 2008 Climate Policy Act aims to reduce
GHG emissions by 80% from 1990 levels, by 2050. Agricultural prac-
tices are addressed, as agricultural CH4 emissions are the dominant
domestic source, but are difficult to reduce. Sweden also provides
tax benefits for biomethane use, and has quotas for consumer use
[249].

In 2002, an EU regulation was adopted to regularize reporting
of MSW. The EU-wide data were first produced in 2007 [84]. The
most significant policy affecting solid waste CH4 emissions is the
EU Landfill Directive, adopted in 1999. The directive uses 1995 as
a base year. Member nations are required to reduce landfilling of
biodegradable wastes. The reductions are 25% by 2004 (to 75% of
1995 levels), 50% by 2007, and 65% by 2016 (to 35% of 1995 levels)
[84]. The 65% reduction target date has been reset to 2018, and a
“priority project” of zero landfilling of degradable wastes was iden-
tified in 2011 (Global Methane Initiative 2013b). Landfilled waste
is now required to be treated, except where such treatment is “not
technically feasible.” As of 2008, Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Germany, Luxembourg, and The Netherlands were characterized as
having exceeded the standard, Finland, France, Italy, Sweden, and
the U.K. were in compliance, and Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain
were said to be in the process of implementation [84]. In 2011, it
was made mandatory for all member states to have gas collection
requirements for all landfills receiving biodegradable wastes [319].
IEA [167] believes its analysis shows individual country’s feed-
in tariffs were most effective in spurring growth of LFG projects,
especially from 2000 to 2005. Idiosyncratic policies, such as Italy’s
quota system, were also helpful. The 2009 Renewable Energy Di-
rective and the 2008 Waste Recycling and Recovery directive also
support biogas use [249].

X. Chai et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 56 (2016) 33–70

The EU requires GHG emission reductions from its member states,
with levels of reductions based on each member’s relative wealth.
The standards are set for the major constituent GHGs, including CH4,
and are further targeted by generating sector. The waste CH4 targets
are driven by the Landfill Directive program, with no specific
amounts of CH4 reductions being specified [319].

7.4. Policy gaps

Each of the three major players works in relative isolation from
each other. While the US has awareness that organic inputs into land-
fills constitute a major source of fugitive CH4, its relatively laissez-
faire attitude toward waste management means that no general
proscription against landfilling these materials has been adopted.
The EU has been much more pro-active; however, the EU is un-
willing to provide the financial wherewithal needed to implement
this policy across the poorer members of the union. The US tends
to view CH4 reductions as accessory to the main thrust of waste man-
agement; European willingness to shoulder higher tax burdens
means that governments there subsidize activities that in the US
need to be self-supporting. Some of the technologies adopted in the
EU to minimize landfill CH4 are very inefficient, producing neither
large amounts of useful energy nor end products fit for anything
other than landfilling (albeit with greatly reduced gas generation
capabilities).

China is in the process of developing a comprehensive waste man-
agement program. Absent an active environmentally-minded
population and with rapid urban expansion in the east, waste-to-
energy incineration is gaining favor as a means of treating waste
and producing electricity. Legacy landfills abound in the east,
however, and landfilling is continuing to be an attractive prospect
in the west. The role of landfill-gas-to-energy projects in the future
of China’s energy mix is unclear.

Mitigation of CH4 releases in the face of goals set at COP21 is
clearly necessary. The mitigation cannot be so expensive as to be
unadoptable across a world where universal waste management is
often absent. Currently accepted research findings support models
that often dissuade decision-makers from gas projects, but these
findings may not accurately describe in situ food waste decay, and
are based on static waste properties for the landfill inputs. Tech-
nical advances may allow better utilization of available gas resources.
We believe that retrofitting landfills or building them in the first
place with the necessary infrastructure to capture available CH4
makes good sense, and to seek the greatest economic return for the
captured gas makes even more sense. In the long run, the EU di-
rective to eliminate landfills as a source of CH4 is sound policy: source
reduction usually has greater dividends and requires less technol-
ogy to implement (technology that usually has inherent inefficiencies
itself). However, the means available now to treat organic wastes
rely on human sorting of wastes, something that has not worked
so well to date. Until a reliable backstop to human efforts at sorting
is developed, or we overcome our distaste for smokestack solu-
tions to waste management, it is likely that landfills will continue
to play an important role in waste management worldwide, and the
need to effectively capture and then use landfill gas will continue.

8. Lessons learned

Methane is the second most potent greenhouse gas; its atmo-
spheric concentrations are rising at a rate of 0.5% yr−1. Although fossil
methane is emitted from natural processes and exploitation of pe-
troleum, coal, and natural gas resources, most methane is generated
by microbial degradation of organic matter in a variety of anaero-
bic settings. Landfills already constitute a major source of
anthropogenic methane, and this source terms are projected to in-
crease into the foreseeable future. The amount of LFG generated and

(more importantly) released to the atmosphere is measured by
models and monitoring. The scale of these measurements is from
individual measuring points at particular landfills to the entire world,
although almost all of these assessments are no more than crude
approximations. The materials sent to landfills, even when consis-
tent at one site, are heterogeneous in nature, and the conditions
within a landfill are affected by a number of difficult to describe con-
ditions and processes. These include moisture availability, the
presence or absence of casings on the degradable matter, the degree
of compaction, the presence or absence of internal fires, weather,
and climate. This means generalized models or point source mea-
surements may not appropriately detail the actual processes that
are occurring. Some more extensive monitoring processes are ham-
pered by reproducibility and quality control issues. Although the
processes and conditions that lead to degradation are well tested
in laboratory simulacrums of landfills, these experimental data do
not appear to translate well to the actual sites where wastes are
buried. Broad estimates of LFG releases are hampered by the general
inability to count solid wastes well, and by poor descriptions of waste
management systems by many countries. Still, although measures
of the amount of gas being produced are not made well at most any
scale, landfills continue to generate a gas that is approximately equal
amounts of methane and carbon dioxide, along with some minor
constituents. This product, if released to the atmosphere, can affect
human health (due to the carcinogenic and toxic nature of some
of the minor constituents), and also has climate change potential.
Therefore, most countries are seeking to limit its release.
Methanotropes that develop naturally on the surface of landfills will
consume a portion of the methane and some of the other constitu-
ents of concern, and conditions can be created that favor their growth
and enhance their degradative powers. More effective than micro-
bial controls on the landfill surface is to enclose the landfill with
some impervious surface, and then to collect the landfill gas within
the wastes through a vacuum-driven system. The collected gases
will, for many sites, support combustion and the conversion to oxi-
dized forms of much less environmental and human health concern.
Better than flaring the gas is to use it for constructive pur-
poses. Methane is an energy molecule so its stored energy potential
can be exploited. For many sites, this means simply burning the gas
in an engine and using that energy to produce electricity. However,
more complicated and potentially lucrative options are available:
the gas can be used in combined heat and power systems, cleaned
to meet standards for pipeline use or as a compressed natural gas
fuel, or processed in various ways to serve as substrates for spe-
cialty chemicals or alternative vehicle fuels (such as drop-in
hydrocarbon replacements, methanol, DME, higher alcohols, or hy-
drogen to run a fuel cell). Many of these options, even the base case
of electricity production through an engine, require that the gas be
cleaned of impurities and upgraded to increase its energy density.
Nonetheless, wastes are produced daily (worldwide waste dispos-
al estimates range from 0.5 to 2 kg d−1, with even more produced
in the US); thus, the effort to create a product from this available,
renewable energy source may make economic sense. Lately, the
biggest challenge is to match the relatively small feedstock and
address “economy of scale” issues; this has spawned a mini-GTL in-
dustry for flared natural gas produced in wellfields but is equally
applicable to LFG. One broad vision would be to install community-
level fuel production units at landfill sites, reduce the site’s carbon
footprint, and create fuels from waste.

Many governments see the sense in using this waste gas for good
purposes. Some promote landfill gas use through incentives of
various kinds, and policies that foster creative and more wide-
spread exploitation of the gas resource. The US, both at home and
through a global organization it sponsors, is the prime player in these
kinds of activities. Other governments, however, seek to minimize
fugitive methane by cutting it off at the source, mostly by limiting

the landfilling of organic matter, either by banning particular ma-
terials or treating wastes before burial, or by seeking entirely different
means of managing wastes other than landfills. The EU countries,
especially Germany, have been at the forefront of this strategic ap-
proach. China, as the largest waste producer and the largest CO2
emissions (28% of the global total) in the world, and a nation still
establishing an infrastructure for environmentally sound, cost-
effective waste management, is a notable example for developing
countries, to guide them as they become more prosperous and tech-
nologically advanced.

The general understanding is that modern landfills will produce
landfill gas for at least twenty years and perhaps fifty years after
wastes are first buried. Methane also has a relative short atmo-
spheric half-life, especially compared to carbon dioxide. We,
therefore, believe that programs that seek to capture and then ben-
eficially use LFG are needed for the next 50 years at a minimum,
and they would be best if they fostered site-specific evaluations and
prescriptions, rather than seeking to establish generic approaches
based on sometimes poorly-founded conventional wisdom, espe-
cially for sites in less developed countries. We think such tailored,
nuanced policies and programs could help create sustainable energy
projects, often in areas where the need for unconventional, green
power is great. Of course, approaches that can process both CH4 and
CO2 to produce fuels must be at the core of advanced technology
development. This review attempted to cover these topics to lay the
foundation for further study that will optimize conditions and allow
energy harvest from methane with concomitant reduction of its
release into the atmosphere. The 2015 COP21 agreement in Paris,
if fully enacted, could accelerate development of science, technolo-
gies and policies that can help contain the rise in earth’s temperature
to 2 °C in the twenty-first century.
