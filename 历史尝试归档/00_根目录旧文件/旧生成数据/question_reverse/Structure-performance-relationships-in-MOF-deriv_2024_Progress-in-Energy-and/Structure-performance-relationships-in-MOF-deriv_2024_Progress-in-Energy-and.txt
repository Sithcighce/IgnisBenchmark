Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great potential as electrocatalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide
(CO2), due to their highly tunable and porous structures. However, unlocking their full potential necessitates a
comprehensive understanding of structure-performance relationships to guide rational design. This review
provides a meticulous analysis of MOF electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR), emphasizing
correlations between composition, morphology, and catalytic performance. Key structure-function aspects are
explored across various MOF-derived materials, encompassing the impact of metal identity, organic linker
chemistry, porosity, defect concentration, and particle morphology. Physicochemical properties related to sub-
strate adsorption and active site availability are linked to catalytic activities, product selectivities, energy effi-
ciencies, and overpotentials. The review identifies several performance-limiting factors, including suboptimally
tuned active sites and weak structure-selectivity linkages. However, the modular nature of MOFs presents op-
portunities to address these challenges through synthetic tuning. Future prospects, involving advanced charac-
terization techniques, are also discussed. Finally, a separate section is devoted to the potential (industrial)
valorization of the process. This critical review aims to distill guiding principles for design and optimization from
existing trends, facilitating the development of MOF electrocatalysts capable of driving sustainable CO2 reduc-
tion at industrial scales. The realization of this promising technology holds the potential to provide renewable
fuels and mitigate climate change through carbon capture and conversion utilizing intermittent renewable en-
ergy sources.

1. Introduction

The excessive emissions of atmospheric carbon dioxide pose a dire
threat to global sustainability and human security. As a primary driver
of anthropogenic climate change, CO2 emissions are destabilizing
Earth’s climate patterns and amplifying the severity of natural disasters
worldwide. Heightening this crisis is humanity’s persistent dependence
on fossil fuels to meet escalating energy demands. However, there is a
potential solution within the very industrial processes responsible for
carbon pollution. Innovative technologies, such as electrocatalytic CO2

reduction (ECR), offer a promising avenue. This approach aims to
directly convert atmospheric CO2 into valuable fuels and chemicals
through catalytic electrochemical processes. By diverting once-wasted
carbon from the atmosphere into useful materials, it offers a two-
pronged solution: mitigating climate change while simultaneously
developing renewable substitutes to replace fossil feedstocks in industry.
A variety of catalytic strategies have emerged to chemically utilize
CO2, including thermal hydrogenation [1–6], photocatalysis [7–10],
and electrocatalysis [11–13]. Among these, electroreduction distin-
guishes itself due to its promising scalability and flexibility [14,15].
Functioning as an electricity-powered technique, it leverages intermit-
tent renewable energy sources, allowing for precise control of reaction
conditions through applied potential. Though substantial challenges
persist, ongoing advancements in catalyst design and process optimi-
zation hold the promise of unlocking the full potential of CO2 electro-
reduction. This transformative capability has the potential to convert
prevalent greenhouse emissions into renewable carbon resources, a
vision that harmonizes scientific progress with the imperatives of envi-
ronmental stewardship and global economic sustainability.

The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into fuels and low-
carbon chemicals holds promise as a viable method for long-term energy
storage using renewable power sources. By harnessing intermittent wind
and solar electricity to drive multi-electron redox transformations of
CO2, this process aims to achieve both energy storage and net green-
house gas sequestration. At the core of CO2 electroreduction are proton-
coupled electron transfer steps that can proceed via diverse reaction
pathways, ranging from 2-electron processes producing carbon mon-
oxide to 6-electron pathways forming methanol. However, the resulting
products are intricately influenced by factors such as the nanostructured
morphology, composition, and reactive surface sites of the electro-
catalyst. Evaluating catalyst performance requires a systematic exami-
nation of key metrics, such as overpotential, current density, Faraday
efficiency, and durability. Yet CO2 electroreduction presents substantial
kinetic barriers, as CO2 is thermodynamically stable and requires sig-
nificant activation for carbon-carbon bond formation toward multi-
carbon products [14–16]. While past work has provided valuable
insights, further advancing this complex, multistep process necessitates
a more critically integrative approach. This involves a thorough inter-
rogation and correlation of mechanistic understanding of catalytic
processes and advanced material design principles, systematically

relationships at the molecular level.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent an intriguing class of
crystalline, porous materials constructed through coordination bonds
between metal ions/clusters and organic linkers [17,18]. The abundance
of metal ions/clusters and the versatile geometries of organic ligands
endow MOFs with extraordinary designability at the molecular scale,
granting precisely tunable properties including ultrahigh surface areas,
nanoporous architectures, and functionalized active sites [19–26]. This
unprecedented synthetic malleability has prompted extensive applica-
tions of MOFs in critical domains such as energy [27–29], environment
[30–33], and materials [34–36]. Their highly modular structures are
particularly well-suited for electrocatalysis, as the incorporation of
catalytically active metal sites within porous scaffolds provides inte-
grated opportunities for both substrate pre-concentration via adsorption
and energetic facilitation of transformations at coordinated active cen-
ters. While conventional materials used in electrochemical reactions,
such as graphene oxide, conducting polymers, metal oxides and transi-
tion metals, provide active sites for chemical transformations, MOFs
possess inherent structural properties that may potentially enhance
reactivity. Specifically, the high specific surface area intrinsic to MOFs’
porous molecular architecture facilitates exposure of a greater number
and density of active sites compared to non-porous alternatives. More-
over, their predetermined geometric configurations and tunable poros-
ities are proposed to expedite rapid charge carrier transport
to
distributed active centers. The metallic nodes within MOF structures,
typically comprising metal ion clusters, are posited to serve as proficient
active sites. Claims of their monodisperse atomic utilization efficiency
approaching 100 % are intriguing but require further empirical valida-
tion. Simultaneously, the modular design of MOFs allowing targeted
organic ligand functionalization is suggested to endow heightened
selectivity at the chemical and structural levels. This may optimize re-
action pathways and product yields. Due to these advantageous struc-
tural characteristics, MOFs have increasingly attracted attention as
platforms for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) [37–42], a crucial
process for renewable carbon fuels and chemicals production from this
ubiquitous greenhouse gas. While the inherent structural properties of
MOFs have posed some limitations to their applicability in ECR, in-
vestigations have highlighted the exceptional catalytic potential of
derived MOF materials. Beyond their native structures, MOF derivatives

can preserve advantageous traits such as high surface area and porosity,
while also enhancing attributes like chemical and thermal resilience,
which are typically limited within pristine MOF frameworks. More
significantly, by deliberately manipulating synthetic conditions, it is
possible to create a diverse array of functionalized MOF-based materials.
This suggests that such derived morphologies may broaden the scope of
MOF contributions to electrocatalytic transformations. With refined
synthetic control and an extensive diversity of MOF-derivable struc-
tures, further optimizations can potentially overcome the limitations
posed by inherent MOF structural characteristics. A thorough analysis of
critical structure-performance relationships across these functionalized
materials may thus uncover optimized pathways for harnessing the full
potential of these remarkable porous frameworks in electrocatalysis.

Despite the growing number of literature reviews on various aspects
of MOF electrocatalysis, existing studies often focus narrowly on specific
material types or reaction pathways [43–45]. By contrast, this review
aims to provide a comprehensive and discerning analysis of the progress,
opportunities, and challenges across the dynamic field of MOF electro-
catalysis for CO2 reduction. We propose a systematic examination of
MOF electrocatalysts from multiple complementary angles, including
pristine MOF structures, MOF-derived materials, bimetallic MOF com-
binations, and single-atom MOF configurations. By evaluating trends
across this diverse spectrum of compositions and morphologies, we aim
to uncover fundamental new insights into structure-performance re-
lationships. Our analysis will scrutinize how intentional alterations to
synthesis methods and catalytic formulations influence key material
properties such as activity, selectivity, and energy efficiency. The goal is
to elucidate optimal structural and compositional determinants through
a rigorous and evidence-based approach. By methodically examining
these physicochemical factors, we aim to distill guiding design princi-
ples for strategically engineering improved MOF electrocatalysts. We
hope that these insights will further advance scalable and sustainable
CO2 conversion technologies (Fig. 1).

2. Cu MOF-based electrocatalysts

Copper stands out as a unique electrocatalyst capable of facilitating
CO2 cleavage and multicarbon coupling reactions leading to C2+ product
formation under aqueous conditions. However, while copper demon-
strates the ability to cleave the thermodynamically stable C––O bond, its
intrinsic catalytic properties yield poor selectivity for specific C2+
products and inefficient faradaic efficiencies overall. To address these
limitations, significant effort has focused on tuning the structural and
electronic properties of copper through integration within MOF plat-
forms. By manipulating factors such as exposed crystal facets, nano-
porosity, metal coordination geometry, and bimetallic interfacial sites,
researchers aim to modulate adsorption/desorption kinetics and selec-
tively stabilize reactive intermediates. While prior work has demon-
strated copper-based MOF electrocatalysts can promote multielectron
redox transformations of CO2, challenges persist
in consistently
achieving high product selectivity and durabilities required for scalable
applications. A more rigorous structure-function analysis is still needed
to disentangle relationships between synthetic tuning parameters,
resulting physicochemical properties, and impacts on CO2 conversion
pathways and kinetics.

2.1. Cu MOF electrocatalysts

Since the inaugural investigations in the early 2010s, copper-based
metal-organic frameworks (Cu-MOFs) have emerged as a prominent
class of electrocatalysts explored for ECR due to their integration of
copper’s catalytic properties within ordered, nanoporous scaffolds [46].
Hinogami et al. first demonstrated the potential of a Cu-containing MOF
platform, reporting copper rubeanate achieved near-exclusive selec-
tivity for formic acid production with far greater faradaic efficiencies
than bulk copper electrodes [47]. In contrast to Cu metal electrodes,

which produced a variety of products, the CR-MOF electrode exclusively
generated formic acid (HCOOH) during electrocatalyzed CO2 reduction,
exhibiting a remarkable Faraday efficiency (FE) of over 98 %. Moreover,
the amount of HCOOH on the CR-MOF electrode was 13.4 μmol/cm2/h
at (cid:0) 1.2 VSHE, representing a 13-fold increase compared to that observed
on the metal Cu electrode. Beyond providing a proof of concept, how-
still needed to elucidate the

structural-functional relationships governing Cu-MOF electrocatalysis.
Shortly thereafter, Kumar et al. reported the synthesis of Cu3(BTC)2
MOF (known as HKUST-1) on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode using an
electrochemical method [48]. A continuous film of Cu3(BTC)2 formed on
GC facilitated the electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) process in a
carbon
0.01 M tetrabutylammonium tetra-
fluoroborate/N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte solution. The
main product yield, oxalic acid, reached 97.51 %, with a corresponding
FE of 51 %. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) responses of Cu3(BTC)2 coated on
the GC electrode revealed the formation of Cu(I) species at a potential of
+

in the CO2-saturated DMF solution. Subsequently,
these species formed adducts with CO2 and underwent electrochemical
processes to produce oxalic acid.

Albo et al. employed a solvent-free approach to synthesize HKUST-1,
subsequently showcasing its electrocatalytic prowess in converting CO2
to alcohols using gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) as supports [49]. The
establishment of a characteristic gas-solid-liquid three-phase interface,
achieved by depositing the catalysts on a gas diffusion layer, effectively
eliminated mass-transfer limitations, thereby augmenting CO2 reduction
performance. In this study, HKUST-1 was compared with the MOF
[Cu2(μ3-C5H4N5)2]n (CuAdeAce), as well as two metal-organic aerogels,
[Cu(μ-C2H2N2S2)]n
[Cu0.6Zn0.4(μ-C2H2N2S2)]n
(CuZnDTA), in terms of electrochemical CO2 reduction properties under
various operational conditions. The results revealed that HKUST-1 and
CuZnDTA exhibited the most promising performance, with FE for liquid
products (CH3OH, C2H5OH) reaching 15.9 % and 9.9 %, respectively, at
(cid:0) 2, an electrolyte-flow/area ratio
a current density (j) of 10 mA cm
(cid:0) 2, and a gas-flow/area ratio (Qg/A) of 20 mL
(Qe/A) of 3 mL min
(cid:0) 2. Finally, the stability assessment confirmed that GDEs based
min
on HKUST-1 and CuZnDTA could operate for as long as 17 h and 12 h,
respectively. This longevity can be attributed to the preservation of the
local structure.

was utilized as the active material for catalyzing CO2 reduction. Qiu
et al. introduced it into the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) as a CO2
adsorbent, while Cu nanoparticles acted as the active catalyst for ECR,
resulting in hydrocarbon production [50]. In experiments conducted
with gas diffusion electrode and an optimal addition of Cu-MOF
(ranging from 7.5 to 10 wt%), the FEs of CH4 were 2–3 times higher
compared to the bare gas diffusion electrode without Cu-MOF addition.
These improvements were observed under relatively negative potentials
(as low as (cid:0) 2.3 to (cid:0) 2.5 V vs. SCE (saturated calomel electrode)) in a 0.5
M NaHCO3 electrolyte solution. The remarkable CO2 capture perfor-
mance of HKUST-1, attributed to gas coordination with exposed unsat-
urated Cu sites, not only enhanced the CO2 concentration at the
GDE-electrolyte interface but also suppressed the competitive hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER). This suppression contributed to improved
ECR selectivities and activities.

Wu et al. successfully synthesized porphyrinic MOF nanosheets uti-
lizing a Cu(II) paddle wheel cluster as a foundation, demonstrating their
efficacy in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 [51]. Compared to CuO,
Cu2O, Cu, a porphyrin-Cu(II) complex, and a CuO/complex composite,
the cathodized Cu2(CuTCPP) nanosheets exhibited remarkable activity

in formate production, achieving a FE of 68.4 % at (cid:0) 1.55 V vs. Ag/Ag
in a hybrid electrolyte comprising 1 M H2O and 0.5 M ionic liquid 1-eth-
yl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EmimBF4) (Fig. 2). Subse-
quent investigations revealed that the Cu-MOF electrode facilitated the
generation of acetate as a C–C coupling product, in addition to formate,
over a broad voltage range from (cid:0) 1.40 V to (cid:0) 1.65 V with the total liquid
product FE from 38.8 % to 85.2 %. This heightened selectivity and ac-
tivity were ascribed to the reconstruction of cathodized Cu2(CuTCPP)
nanosheets into a composite comprising CuO, Cu2O, and Cu4O3
anchored with the TCPP ligand.

Subsequently, Yang and co-workers utilized CuII/adeninato/car-
boxylato metal-biomolecule frameworks (CuII/ade-MOFs) for ECR to-
wards hydrocarbon production, specifically CH4, and C2H4 [52]. In this
study, the author prepared three Cu-ade MOFs with varying thicknesses,
denoted as Cu-ade nanosheets (s-Cu-ade), nanoplates (p-Cu-ade) and
nanocuboids (c-Cu-ade), respectively. Notably, the Cu-ade nanosheets
exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, achieving a total hydro-
carbon FE exceeding 73 %. C2H4 was generated at (cid:0) 1.4 VRHE with a

density of ~15 mA cm
chemical analysis suggested that active Cu nanocrystals, formed through
the structural evolution of cathodized Cu-MOFs, were responsible for the
remarkable electrochemical CO2 reduction leading to hydrocarbons.

Cu-MOF possesses an infinite number of Cu2+

metal centers, how-
ever, effectively harnessing Cu2+
sites for CO2 reduction while sup-
pressing Cu2+
reduction and hydrogen evolution has posed a significant
technological challenge. In addressing this challenge, Kang et al.
developed a method to modify Cu-MOF by introducing high-defect sites
on foam copper [38]. By employing foam copper as a substrate, they
successfully modulated the kinetics of MOF growth through the careful
selection of ligands characterized by substantial spatial hindrance. This
strategic choice facilitated the expeditious and comprehensive modifi-
cation of Cu-MOF, leading to the generation of abundant defects on the
foam copper surface. According to electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) analysis, Cu-MOF grown electrochemically exhibited a Cu2+
defect concentration of 15.3 %, whereas Cu-MOF obtained through
traditional thermosynthesis methods only contained 1.5 % Cu2+
defect
sites. Through Qst and density functional theory (DFT) analyses, it was
observed that Cu2+
defects demonstrated a remarkably strong binding
affinity for CO2, with Cu2+
coordinating with oxygen in CO2 through an
O–Cu–O linkage. In the process of CO2 electroreduction, Cu-MOF*OOCH
was more readily formed compared to Cu-MOF*COOH, leading to
enhanced formic acid selectivity. Utilizing a catholyte comprising 0.5 M
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EmimBF4) in acetoni-
trile (0.5 M EMIMBF4/MeCN), the current density generated by the

Two-dimensional conductive metal-organic frameworks

(2D-c-
MOFs) represent a distinct category within the realm of two-dimensional
(2D) MOFs. These frameworks are not only characterized by their
extended 2D coordination structures, but also by their intrinsic con-
ductivity. These lamellar periodic frameworks showcase open channels,

predictable structures, inherent porosity, and elevated charge mobility.
In a notable contribution, Majidi et al. introduced a 2D copper (Cu)-
based conductive MOF (c-MOF), copper tetrahydroxyquinone (Cu-THQ)
for ECR at low overpotentials, utilizing a hybrid electrolyte comprising
1 M choline chloride (C5H14CINO) and 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH)
mixture [53].

The advantages of this hybrid electrolytes such as superior ionic
conductivity, high CO2 solubility, and stability, facilitated the ECR
process. The bulk Cu-THQ underwent exfoliation into 2D nanoflakes
(NFs) through liquid-phase exfoliation, enhancing the surface-to-
volume ratio. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results demonstrated
that Cu-THQ NFs, with an average particle size of 140 nm, exhibited the
(cid:0) 2 at (cid:0) 0.45 VRHE in
highest current density of approximately 173 mA cm
CO2 saturated electrolytes. Results from differential electrochemical
mass spectroscopy (DEMS) and chronoamperometry experiments indi-
cated that the major gas produced during ECR with Cu-THQ NFs was CO
in the (cid:0) 0.135 to (cid:0) 0.43 V versus RHE range. An average FE of CO was
around 91 %, accompanied by a remarkable turnover frequency (TOF)
(cid:0) 1. The author demonstrated the exis-
as high as approximately 20.82 s
tence of reduced Cu (Cu
) during ECR, which reversibly returned to
Cu2+
after the reaction, utilizing operando Cu K-edge X-ray absorption
near edge spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.

Liu et al. innovatively constructed a two-dimensional copper-based
conjugated MOF, denoted as HATNA-Cu-MOF,
incorporating the
hexaazatriphenylene-hexaol (HATNA-6OH) structural motif [54]. This
MOF exhibits notable carbon dioxide adsorption capacity coupled with
superior conductivity. Subsequently, an investigation into the electro-
catalytic CO2 reduction performance of HATNA-Cu-MOF was conduct-
ed. The findings reveal that HATNA-Cu-MOF displays a pronounced
selectivity for methane production in the context of carbon dioxide
reduction,
achieving a noteworthy FE of 78 %. Moreover,
HATNA-Cu-MOF exhibits commendable stability, with its CO2 reduction
current density and selectivity showing negligible decay over an
extended electrocatalytic duration spanning up to 12 h. Nevertheless,

the planar extended structure of 2D-c-MOFs often constrains the acces-
sibility of active sites. To address this obstacle, this group further syn-
thesized a MOF based on triptycene, featuring a vertically extended 2D
structure (Fig. 3) [55]. The weak interlayer interaction in 2D-vc-MOF
(Cu) results in an AA’ stacking configuration, facilitating easy exfolia-
tion. Furthermore, the distinctive vertically extended 2D architecture
exposes fully arranged CuO4 catalytic active sites periodically. This
configuration enhances both the activity and FE (up to 65 %) for elec-
trochemical CO2 reduction. The ECR performance of 2D-vc-MOF(Cu)
exhibits notably superior characteristics in both turnover number and
selectivity when compared to Cu3(HHTP)2 possessing a planarly

extended 2D structure, which was corroborated with DFT calculations.
The elucidation of subtle variations in the coordination environment
of metal ions within catalytic reaction active centers is crucial for un-
derstanding the impact on the selectivity of products in CO2 electro-
catalysis. Qiu et al. constructed a 2D PcCu-Cu-O MOF with dual active

sites,

proven to be beneficial ECR to C2H4 (Fig. 4) [56]. The PcCu-Cu-O
electrocatalyst exhibited much higher performance for electrochemical
CO2 reduction to C2H4 with a FE of 50 % and a current density of 7.3 mA
(cid:0) 2 at (cid:0) 1.2 VRHE in 0.1 M KHCO3 solution, which was about 2-fold

compared with the discrete molecular copper-phthalocyanine PcCu (FE
(C2H4) = 25 %). Further experimental results suggested that the excel-
lent electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergistic effect
between CuPc and CuO4 dual active sites. Specifically, the CO located on
the CuO4 site demonstrates effective migration and dimerization when
interacting with *CO intermediates adsorbed at the C2H4 production site
CuPc. This interaction serves to efficiently lower the barrier for C–C
dimerization. To delve deeper into the impact of d-orbital electrons on
catalytic performance in ECR, particularly in relation to the selectivity of
hydrocarbon products, Liu et al. explored the effects of two MOF scaffold
structures. One incorporated a square pyramidal CuO5 structure, while
the other featured a planar CuO4 metal node. This investigation aimed to
elucidate their respective influences on the electrocatalytic properties of
CO2 reduction [57]. Through catalytic activity characterization, it was
observed that the MOF constructed with the CuO5 structure, utilizing the
dibenzo-[g,p]chrysene-2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15-octaol
(Cu-DBC,
where H8DBC = dibenzo-[g,p]chrysene-2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15-octaol),
achieved an impressive FE of 56 % for CH4 production in the electro-
catalytic reduction of CO2. This notable efficiency was attained at an
(cid:0) 2.
overpotential of (cid:0) 1.4 V and a current density of 11.4 mA cm
Conversely, MOFs containing CuO4 structures, such as Cu-HHTP (HHTP
= 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) and Cu-THQ (THQ = tetra-
hydroxy-1,4-quinone), exclusively generated CO as the reaction product
in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Employing density functional theory
(DFT) calculations and Cu L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy, it was
determined that the energy levels of d orbitals (dz2 , dxz, and dyz) in the
CuO5 structure are higher than those in the CuO4 structure. Conse-
quently, the CuO5 structure exhibited stronger adsorption interactions
with *CO intermediates, facilitating the hydrogenation of *CO to *CHO
and promoting the generation of CH4 instead of CO. This study signifi-
cantly contributes to the comprehension of the mechanisms underlying
hydrocarbon production by Cu-based electrocatalysts in the electro-
chemical reduction of CO2.

ligand

Copper-based catalysts containing Cu(I) centers have attracted sig-
nificant research interest due to their outstanding performance in elec-
trochemical CO2 reduction. Current studies primarily explore how grain
boundaries impact selectivity of the resulting products [58,59]. The
initial step, CO2 adsorption and activation, plays a pivotal role in
determining catalytic activity and end product selectivity. Halides such
as fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide can donate lone pair electrons
to CO2, forming X–C bonds. Introduction of halides is thought to

enhance CO2 adsorption and subsequent activation. Zhang et al. syn-
thesized a series of MOFs featuring different Cu(I) coordination micro-
environments (Cu–Cl, Cu–Br, and Cu–I) to investigate their ECR
performance (Fig. 5) [60]. With the increase in halide atomic radius, the
CO2 adsorption capacity rises, and the d-band center of Cu shifts posi-
tively with respect to the Fermi level, thereby boosting the selectivity
toward CH4 conversion from CO2. The results reveal that the Cu–I
electrode exhibits the highest overall faraday efficiency, reaching up to
(cid:0) 2.
83.2 % at (cid:0) 1.08 V versus RHE with a current density of 88 mA cm
The FE of CH4 (FECH4) remains above 50 % over a wide potential range
from (cid:0) 1.08 to (cid:0) 1.48 V, reaching a maximum of 57.2 % at (cid:0) 1.08 V with
(cid:0) 2. In contrast, the highest FECH4
a partial current density of 60.7 mA cm
of Cu–Cl and Cu–Br are only 32.9 % and 40.2 % at (cid:0) 1.28 V, respectively.
Theoretical calculations suggest that the movement of the d-band center
of Cu facilitates a reduction in the formation energy of *CH2O and
*CH3O intermediates, critical in determining the potential-limiting steps
of ECR. This phenomenon promotes the electrocatalytic reduction of
CO2 to CH4.

2.2. Cu MOF derived electrocatalysts

In addition to the aforementioned application of pristine Cu-MOF as
an electroactive catalyst, significant attention has been focused on the
exploration of various functional porous materials derived from MOFs in
recent years. Generally, MOF derivatives are generated through subse-
quent thermal treatments or chemical reactions applied to MOFs. This
involves employing MOFs as precursors to synthesize electrocatalysts
that not only offer improved stability but also exhibit demonstrate
enhanced catalytic activity [61,62]. This strategic transformation of
MOFs into functional derivatives serves as a pivotal avenue for
advancing the development of robust and efficient electrocatalytic
materials.

2.2.1. Cu-MOF treated by pyrolysis

In the pyrolysis of MOFs, the metal center and ligands can undergo
simultaneous transformation during high-temperature treatment, lead-
ing to the formation of porous carbon and metal/metal oxides, respec-
tively [63]. This process enables the generation of porous materials
doped with varying surface areas and catalytic activities through the
thermal treatment of MOFs with different sources, such as nitrogen,
sulfur, and phosphorus sources [64–66]. These derived materials are

conducive to enhancing electrocatalytic performance, thanks to their
distinct advantages, such as higher surface area, well-dispersed nano-
particles, hierarchical porous structures, and characteristic electronic
structure [67,68]. In 2017, Zhao et al. developed an oxide-derived
Cu/carbon (OD Cu/C) electrocatalyst for ECR, obtained through the
straightforward carbonization of a Cu-based MOF (HKUST-1) (Fig. 6)
[67]. Three types of porous OD Cu/C catalysts with variably sized Cu
nanoparticles were prepared at different temperatures under an argon
atmosphere. The synthesized materials exhibited improved selectivity
for CO2 reduction to alcohol products, with total FEs ranging from 45.2
% to 71.2 % at (cid:0) 0.1 to (cid:0) 0.7 VRHE in a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3
solution. Meanwhile, OD Cu/C-1000 achieved high yields of methanol
(cid:0) 1
and ethanol, with production rates ranging from 5.1 to 12.4 mg L
(cid:0) 1, respectively. This study indicated that the
and 3.7–13.4 mg L
over-potential for C2H5OH formation was approximately ~190 mV,
representing one of the lowest overpotentials ever reported. The
enhanced catalytic performance of the oxide-derived Cu/carbon can be
attributed to the synergistic effect between well-dispersed Cu nano-
particles and the porous carbon matrix.

Nam et al. introduced a novel approach for the creation of MOF-
regulated Cu cluster capable of converting CO2 into multiple-carbon
products through electro-catalysis (Fig. 7) [69]. The acceleration of
undercoordinated sites during Cu cluster formation was achieved by
adjusting the structure of Cu dimers. Following thermal treatment, the
adjacent benzene tricarboxylate moieties were detached, and the sym-
metric Cu dimer of HKUST-1 underwent distortion to adopt an asym-

lating material processing conditions, including calcination temperature
and the weight percentage of HKUST-1. Experimental results indicated
that Cu clusters with a low coordination number formed from the dis-
torted Cu dimer in HKUST-1 during the ECR process. This resulted in a
FE of 45.0 % for C2H4 production, achieved at a current density of 262
mA/cm2 and a potential of (cid:0) 1.07 VRHE.

Cheng and co-workers obtained various copper@nitrogen-doped
carbon (Cu-NC) catalysts derived from MOFs by varying the calcina-
tion temperature of N-containing benzimidazole-modified Cu-BTC
(1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) MOFs (BEN-Cu-BTC) [70]. These
Cu-NC materials showed highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2
products, with the FEs for C2H2 and CH3CH2OH reaching 11.2 % and
18.4 % at (cid:0) 1.01 V vs. RHE in a 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte, respectively.

This notable selectivity for C2H4 and CH3CH2OH can be attributed to the
elevated concentrations of pyrrolic-N and Cu–N species formed at the
C. These species provided abundant
calcination temperature of 400
CO2 adsorption sites and facilitated C–C reactions on the Cu surface.

Li et al. synthesized nitrogen-doped porous carbon frameworks
(Cu2O/Cu@NC) with Cu2O/Cu nanospheres anchored through the
direct carbonization of Cu-BTC MOF at controlled temperatures for CO2
electroreduction (Fig. 8) [68]. Notably, the porous catalyst obtained
from carbonizing Cu-BTC at 800 oC (denoted as Cu2O/Cu@NC-800)
exhibited superior selectivity for formate with a FE of 70.5 % at (cid:0) 0.68 V
vs. RHE in a 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. This performance was 1.79- and
1.84-fold higher than that of Cu2O/Cu@NC-700 and Cu2O/Cu@NC-900,
respectively, while maintaining outstanding catalytic activity for over
30 h. The observed improvement in the activity and selectivity of the
catalyst can be attributed to two key factors. Firstly, an increase in Cu
content, along with well-dispersed Cu2O/Cu nanoparticles within the
carbon frameworks, provided abundant active reaction sites, contrib-
uting to enhanced catalytic performance. Secondly, a higher content of
nitrogen doping incorporated into the Cu2O/Cu lattice potentially
facilitated the generation of *OCHO. Yang et al. developed a novel
MOF-derived Cu@Cu2O heterogeneous
coated with a
nitrogen-doped carbon shell by calcining Cu-BTC MOF at different
temperatures in an air atmosphere. This catalyst was employed for the
electroreduction of CO2 to methanol with highly selectivity [71]. X-ray

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the existence of Cu0/Cu
and OH on the catalyst surfaces. Further investigation suggested that
+
Cu0/Cu
with a moderate CO* binding energy and OH, which favored

to methanol. As a result, the FE of CH3OH produced by Cu@Cu2O-400
oC was 45 % at (cid:0) 0.7 VRHE in a 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte.

2.2.2. Cu-MOF treated by electrochemical technique

In addition to the pyrolysis methodology, an alternative route for the
transformation of Cu-MOF involves its conversion into Cu-nanoparticle-
embedded carbon catalysts through an electrochemical reaction. This
electrochemical conversion pathway introduces a distinct dimension to
the synthesis process, offering a versatile approach for tailoring the
structure and properties of Cu-based catalysts. The electrochemical
method provides a controlled and precise means to embed Cu nano-
particles within a carbon matrix, thereby enhancing the catalytic per-
formance and expanding the applicability of Cu-MOF-derived materials

MOF-74 as a precursor to generate Cu nanoparticles (NPs) for ECR
[72]. The highly isolated Cu NP clusters derived from Cu-MOF-74 not
only enhanced the activity but also improved the selectivity towards
CH4 production in ECR. The FE of CH4 exceeded 50 % at (cid:0) 1.3 VRHE,
accompanied by the suppression of C2 production, showcasing a 2–3
folds increase compared to commercial Cu NPs.

production of C2–C3 products (C2H4, CH3CH2OH, and n-propanol). In
particular, Cu/Cu2O@NG-2 demonstrated the most promising catalytic
performance for ECR to C2–C3 products, achieving a FE of 56 % at (cid:0) 1.9
V vs. RHE in a 0.2 M KI aqueous solution, along with a current density as
high as 19.0 mA/cm2. Further investigations indicated that the uniform
distribution of Cu/Cu2O nanoparticles on the NG support played an
important role in enhancing the electrochemical stability.

Zhu et al. presented an in-situ electrochemical synthesis method for a
heterogeneous electrocatalyst comprising three-dimensional (3D) hier-
archical Cu dendrite derived from MOFs via a facile stepwise strategy
(Fig. 9) [73]. In the initial step, a hollow Cu-MOF thin film was grown
onto 3D Cu gauze (Cu-G) within 5 min, utilizing the electrochemical
deposition technique. During this process, the surfactant hexadecyl tri-
methyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) served as a structural regulator to
modulate the structure of the MOF precursor, resulting in the formation
of Cu-MOF films both with and without CTAB. The results indicated that
the presence of CTAB facilitated the formation of hollow MOFs. Subse-
quently, the as-prepared hollow Cu-MOF was directly used as a pre-
cursor for the working electrode, undergoing in-situ reduction to Cu0
with a dendritic structure during electrochemical CO2 reduction. In
contrast, Cu0 derivatives from non-hollow MOFs exhibited a nanowire
morphology. The electrocatalyst achieved a maximum FE for formate of

Wang et al. proposed a Cu-nanosheet-structured catalyst derived
from HKUST-1 through an in-situ electrochemical reaction [74]. The
resulting electrocatalyst, denoted as HE-Cu (H and E representing
HKUST-1 and electroreduction), exhibited a maximum FE of 40.1 % ±
1.7 % for HCOOH and 12.1 % ± 2.9 % for CO at (cid:0) 1.03 VRHE in
CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solutions. Notably, the FEs for C2 pro-
ductions (C2H4 and C2H6) were more than 9.1- and 13.0-fold higher
compared to those of pristine copper foam (p-Cu). Further electro-
chemical analysis results demonstrated that the excellent activity and
selectivity of HE-Cu for HCOOH and C2 products were ascribed to its
stepped Cu(211) surfaces, (200) facets, and exposed Cu edge sites, all
considered active sites for ECR.

Zhi et al. developed a MOF-derived electrocatalyst through an elec-

precursors [75]. Various Cu/Cu2O@N-doped graphene (Cu/Cu2O@NG)
materials were synthesized by varying the mass ratios of MOF-199 and
NG to achieve efficient electroreduction of CO2, resulting in the

2.2.3. Cu MOF composites

Microscale Cu2O particles, featuring controllable crystal facets and a
relatively stable bulk-phase structure, are considered as promising car-
riers for investigating the mechanism of CO2 reduction. However, the
substantial generation of H2 during the electrocatalytic process often
leads to a lower FE for hydrocarbons. In this context, enhancing the
adsorption capacity of Cu2O for CO2 is imperative to elevate the overall
hydrocarbon FE. Furthermore, the monocomponent Cu2O exhibits a
relatively high selectivity in catalyzing CO2 reduction to C2H4, and its
stability is compromised, undergoing rapid degradation during elec-
trochemical reduction. Addressing these challenges, Tan et al. reported
an all-in-one hybrid catalyst achieved through time-resolved control-
lable restructuration from Cu2O to Cu2O@Cu-MOF (Fig. 10) [59]. Spe-
cifically, Cu2O undergoes gradual etching, dissolution, oxidation to
Cu2+
, and conversion to a Cu-MOF linked on the surface of the undis-
solved Cu2O (Cu2O@Cu-MOF) in the presence of the 1,3,5-tricarboxylic
acid (H3BTC) ligand. The microscopic structure and morphology of this
hybrid catalyst exhibit a time-responsive behavior, evolving with the
(cid:0) 1
treatment duration. The specific surface area increases from 44 m2 g
(cid:0) 1 for Cu2O@Cu-MOF. The CO2 adsorption ca-

pacity of Cu2O@Cu-MOF reaches up to 83.6 cm3 g

electrochemical reduction of CO2, the Cu2O@Cu-MOF catalyst demon-
strates exceptional performance, with a total FE for hydrocarbons (CH4
and C2H4) reaching 79.4 %, notably featuring a FE of 63.2 % for CH4.
The multifunctionality exhibited by the prepared Cu2O@Cu-MOF,
including adsorption, activation, and catalysis, arises from the syner-
gistic effects between Cu-MOF and Cu2O, underscoring the catalyst’s
high electrocatalytic activity and pronounced selectivity for CH4. The
in-situ conversion strategy from Cu2O to Cu2O@Cu-MOF also provides a
novel approach for creating MOF-based catalysts with highly exposed
active sites in catalysis and energy-related fields.

establishing a chemical environment conducive to the formation of
hydrogen bonds, particularly through the introduction of abundant
hydroxyl groups, stability of crucial reaction intermediates is achieved.
This, in turn, facilitates the efficient conversion from CO2 to CH4. In a
study conducted by Yi et al., an in-situ electrochemical approach was
employed to grow Cu2O monotypic sites on a conductive MOFs,
enabling highly efficient electrochemical methanation of CO2 [76]. The
researchers utilized a conductive Cu-MOF with periodically arranged
Cu–O4 nodes, and through a simple one-step electrochemical treatment,
they successfully constructed in situ uniformly distributed monotypic

Cu2O(111) quantum dots on the conductive MOF substrate (CuHHTP)
(Fig. 11). Consequently, the obtained Cu2O@CuHHTP exhibited high
selectivity of 73 % towards CH4 with a partial current density of 10.8
(cid:0) 2 at (cid:0) 1.4 V vs. RHE in ECR. Notably, in the locations where
mA cm
Cu2O quantum dots formed, numerous structural defects were present.
Due to the selected ligand, which contains six hydroxyl groups, an
abundance of hydroxyl groups was exposed at the edges of these defects.
These hydroxyl groups could form hydrogen bonds with intermediate
products (such as *COOH, *CO, *CHO, etc.). Research analysis demon-
strated that the formation of hydrogen bonds effectively stabilized

specific intermediate products, significantly enhancing the selectivity
for CH4. The electrocatalytic performance of various Cu MOF-based
catalysts for ECR are shown in Table 1.

3. Bi MOF-based electrocatalysts

Bismuth (Bi) stands out as a compelling metal for ECR owing to its
cost-effectiveness, earth-abundance, nontoxicity, and low activity in the
competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at cathodic potentials.
The highly accessible Bi3+
and the unique one-dimensional channels in
the Bi-MOF play vital roles in the enhancement of CO2 adsorption and
HCOOH conversion. Porous Bi catalysts have gained widespread use in
ECR due to their remarkable performance in producing formic acid or
formate. Bi MOF electrocatalysts for ECR can be categorized into three
modalities: (1) Utilizing Bi MOF as catalysts; (2) Employing Bi MOF
derivatives as catalysts; (3) Implementing single Bi atoms on N-doped
carbon networks as catalysts.

3.1. Bi MOF-based electrocatalysts

Albo et al. harnessed CuBi-based MOFs, specifically HKUST-1 and
CAU-17, supported on GDEs for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2,
resulting in the production of alcohols with enhanced rates and FEs [77].
This groundbreaking study reveals, for the first time, that the integration
of Bi as a co-catalyst into the reaction system reduces the required
overpotential. This suggests a synergistic contribution of Cu–Bi in the
CO2 reduction pathway. Inspired by this work, Zhang et al. synthesized a
novel bismuth-based metal-organic framework (Bi–MOF) using tri-
mellitic acid as the ligand through a hydrothermal method. The re-
searchers systematically investigated its performance as a catalyst for
electrochemical reduction of CO2 [78]. The as-synthesized Bi-MOFs
exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, with the optimized sample
Bi-BTC-D (with addition of DMF during synthesis), achieving a high
formate FE of up to 95.5 % at (cid:0) 0.86 VRHE, with a current density of
(cid:0) 2. Furthermore, after continuous electrolysis for 12 h, the
(cid:0) 11.2 mA cm
FE was maintained at over 90.0 % without significant reduction. Mea-
surement results indicated that the excellent performance can be

attributed to the unique structure of Bi-BTC-D. Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations demonstrated that the Bi sites in Bi-BTC-D are highly
efficient for formate production with very low overpotentials. This
validates the significant potential of utilizing Bi–MOFs as highly stable
and molecularly tunable catalytic materials for ECR.

Subsequently, Li et al. introduced a distinctive 2D bismuth metal-
organic framework (CAU-17) with permanently open and accessible
pores for highly efficient ECR to formic acid (Fig. 12) [79]. This 2D
open-framework structure, formed by helical Bi–O rods bridged by tri-
topic carboxylate ligands, demonstrates outstanding FE for HCOOH
production across a broad potential range, achieving 92.2 % at ~ (cid:0) 0.9 V
(vs. RHE), and demonstrating excellent durability over 30 h. The
mass-specific HCOOH partial current density reaches up to 41.0 mA
(cid:0) 1, surpassing that of commercial Bi2O3 and Bi sheets by four times at
mgBi
~ (cid:0) 1.1 V (vs. RHE). In-situ and differential X-ray absorption fine
structure spectroscopy confirmed the structural features of Bi-MOF,
maintaining Bi(3+) during and after prolonged ECR. Theoretical cal-
culations further suggest that the crystal channels with abundant Bi
active sites in the MOF structure facilitate the formation of *HCOO while
suppressing the side reaction of hydrogen evolution, thereby leading to
high selectivity for HCOOH.

3.2. Bi MOF-derived electrocatalysts

Recently, the enhanced intrinsic conductivity and activity observed
in metal/carbon hybrids derived from MOFs have demonstrated prom-
ising potential in electrochemical reactions [80,81]. The homogeneous
dispersion of Bi species within Bi-based MOFs presents excellent pros-
pects for the formation of Bi/C composites. Deng et al. employed a
bismuth-based MOF to synthesize the Bi2O3@C catalyst for efficient CO2
electroreduction (Fig. 13) [82]. The resulting Bi2O3@C-800 exhibited a
low onset potential of (cid:0) 0.28 V (vs. RHE), a stable FE of 93 %, and a high
(cid:0) 2 at (cid:0) 1.1 V (vs. RHE) for
partial current density exceeding 200 mA cm

trochemical results demonstrated that the Bi2O3@C hybrid synergisti-
cally promotes the selective and rapid reduction of CO2, with the carbon
matrix contributing to enhancing activity and current density, while the

Subsequently, Yang et al. constructed leafy Bi nanosheets with a hybrid
Bi/Bi–O interface (Bi NSs) by in situ electroreduction of the claviform
CAU-17 precursor, which enables CO2 reduction to HCOOH with high
activity, selectivity, and stability [83]. The current density can reach
(cid:0) 2 in gas diffusion cell configuration, and
industrial levels of 200 mA cm
the faradaic efficiency for transforming CO2 to HCOOH can achieve over
85 or 90 % in 1 M KHCO3 or KOH for at least 10 h. Research results
demonstrated that the Bi/Bi–O hybridized surface of leaf-shaped bis-
muth nanosheets enhances the adsorption capacity for CO2, while also
preserving the surface structure of the prepared leaf-shaped bismuth

electroreduction. These works provide

realm [84]. The study demonstrated that MOF-derived Bi2O2CO3

exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance across a wide poten-
tial range, achieving a formate FE (FEHCOO(cid:0) ) of 96.1 % at (cid:0) 0.669 V vs.
(cid:0) 2 for 48 h, displaying
RHE with a current density of 12.7 mA cm
outstanding durability. Compared to structurally similar bismuth oxy-
halides, MOF-derived Bi2O2CO3 demonstrates higher stability and lower
CO2 concentration dependence during the CO2 reduction process.
Furthermore, this work introduces a novel strategy for achieving in situ
MOF transformation and provides an in-depth understanding of the
stability of electrocatalysts.

Zhang et al. utilized a solvothermal method to synthesize a bismuth-
based MOF, abbreviated as CAU-17, on a carbon cloth substrate.
Through an in-situ electrochemical transformation strategy, bismuth
nanosheet arrays (Bi/CC-17) were fabricated without the need for high-
temperature pyrolysis (Fig. 14) [85]. For comparative purposes, another
bismuth-based MOF (CAU-7) was also used as a precursor, and Bi/CC-7
was prepared using the same in-situ electrochemical reduction strategy
as Bi/CC-17. It is noteworthy that the nanostructure of the synthesized
bismuth electrocatalysts is highly dependent on the type of precursor
(CAU-17 or CAU-7). The results indicated that the Bi/CC-17 nanosheet
arrays can tightly adhere to the surface of carbon cloth, facilitating
electron transfer between the catalyst and the substrate. In contrast,
Bi/CC-7 exhibits a morphology of nanoparticles attached to each other
on the substrate, sharply differing from the morphology of Bi/CC-17.
The porous and hierarchical morphology of Bi/CC-17 provides
numerous edge-active sites and enhances mass transfer, thereby boost-
ing cathode current density. The study demonstrated that
the
as-synthesized Bi/CC-17 nanosheet arrays achieved an impressive FE of
98 % for HCOOH production at (cid:0) 1.1 V vs. RHE, with a partial current
(cid:0) 2. Moreover, the FE (>95 %) remained high
density reaching 45 mA cm
over a potential window of 500 mV ranging from (cid:0) 0.8 V to (cid:0) 1.3 V vs.
RHE. The outstanding catalytic performance of Bi/CC-17 nanosheet
arrays highlights the importance of the synergistic effect between the
electrocatalyst and the carbon cloth substrate. The electrocatalytic
performance with various Bi MOF-based catalysts for ECR are shown in
Table 2.

4. Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Re, and in MOF-based electrocatalysts

Transition metal-based compounds harbor substantial potential in
energy conversion. The valence electrons of transition metals, such as

Fe, Co, Ni, occupy d orbitals, located in close proximity to the Fermi
level [86]. Variations in the filling of d orbital electrons induce changes
in the relative position of the d orbital center concerning the Fermi level,
thereby manifesting diverse catalytic activities. Electrocatalytic carbon
dioxide reduction represents a multi-electron and proton-coupled pro-
cess, with the inherent activity of the catalyst dictated by its surface
electronic structure. In this context, the adaptability of the valence
electron orbitals in transition metal-based compounds positions them as
ideal catalysts for augmenting the efficiency and selectivity of electro-
catalytic carbon dioxide reduction.

4.1. Fe MOF/-derived electrocatalysts

Fe-based MOFs find widespread applications in energy storage,
sensors, and gas storage and separation. However, the practical use of
Fe-MOFs is often hindered by their relatively low water stability, which
limits their applications. The loss of Fe also contributes to structure
degradation, affecting the stability during the reaction process. To date,
only two studies have reported Fe-MOF-based electrocatalysts for elec-
trochemical reduction.

Hod et al. employed a thin film of Fe-porphyrin-based MOF-525
[Fe_MOF-525] as a platform for anchoring a substantial quantity of
electro-active molecular catalyst on a conductive electrode for the
electrochemical reduction of CO2 [87]. Thin films of MOF-525 on FTO
were obtained from a toluene suspension of microcrystalline MOF
powder through electrophoretic deposition (EPD). MOF-525 was chosen
as the catalyst immobilizer due to its excellent molecular-scale porosity
and outstanding chemical stability. Reductive potential step analysis of
the Fe_MOF-525 film revealed an effective catalyst surface concentra-
tion approximately three orders of magnitude higher than the estimated
monolayer coverage and nearly one order of magnitude higher than any
previously reported loading for a heterogenized molecular CO2 reduc-
tion catalyst. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, conducted under
both N2 and CO2 atmospheres, confirmed that the Fe-porphyrin linker of
Fe_MOF-525 is responsible for electrocatalysis, showing a catalytic wave
at the potential of the Fe(I/0) couple. The results demonstrated that the
chemical products of CO2 reduction are a mixture of CO and H2, with a
FE of approximately 100 %. These findings validate the strategy of
employing MOF chemistry to obtain porous, electrode-immobilized
for energy-relevant
networks of molecular catalysts competent

electrochemical reactions.

Heterogeneous electrocatalysis offers enhanced control over the
chemical environment of catalyst active sites, improving performance
and overcoming drawbacks associated with deactivation in homoge-
neous conditions, such as aggregation or dimerization. It also enables
the use of benign aqueous solutions. Dong et al. introduced a highly
stable three-dimensional porphyrin-based MOF (PCN-222(Fe)) into
heterogeneous catalysis using a simple dip-coating method (Fig. 15)
[88]. To enhance conductivity, the as-synthesized MOF material was
mixed with carbon black. As a result, the composite catalyst PCN-222
(Fe)/C (mass ratio = 1:2) exhibited high electrocatalytic performance
for the reduction of CO2 in a CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 aqueous so-
(cid:0) 2) and a
lution, with a 494 mV overpotential (at j = 1.2 mA cm
maximum FE (FECO) of 91 %, achieving a turnover frequency (TOF) of
(cid:0) 1. After 10 h of electrolysis at (cid:0) 0.60 V vs. RHE (average
0.336 site
FECO 80.4 %), the catalyst retained its crystallinity and stability, pro-
(cid:0) 1). These
ducing 334 μmol of CO with a TOF of 0.012 s
results demonstrated the substantial catalytic impact of PCN-222(Fe)/C
on the electrochemical reduction of CO2, attributed to the combination
of the intrinsic activity of the porphyrin molecule, promising CO2
adsorption ability endowed by the preserved porosity, and the high
conductivity of carbon black.

4.2. Co MOF/-derived electrocatalysts

Cobalt is an appealing metal for electrocatalysis because of its ad-
vantageous characteristics such as low cost, high abundance, and
excellent activity in ECR [89]. Kornienko et al. devised an electro-
chemical CO2 reduction system based on MOFs by selecting cobalt
porphyrin MOFs [Al2(OH)2TCPP-Co] with catalytic linker units and
fabricating them into thin films covering conductive substrates (Fig. 16)
[40]: Appropriate catalytic linker units (Fig. 16a) were assembled into a
porous thin film MOF (Fig. 16b), which grew on a conductive substrate
(Fig. 16c), thereby establishing the MOF-based electrochemical CO2
reduction system. Porphyrin units were linked to aluminum oxide rods,
forming a 3D porous structure with pores of 6 × 11 Å2. The thin film
exhibited high selectivity in converting CO2 to CO (76 % FE) with a high

turnover number (TON = 1400). In situ spectroelectrochemical mea-
surements revealed that the Co(II) centers were reduced to Co(I)
throughout the MOF, followed by the reduction of CO2. This represents
the first MOF catalyst designed for the electrocatalytic conversion of
aqueous CO2 to CO, and its high-performance characteristics provide an
encouraging foundation for further development of this approach.

In the ECR process, the activation of CO2 on the surface of electro-
catalyst is considered as the rate-determining step, underscoring the
importance of elucidating its adsorption and activation mechanism.
Huang et al. have developed a hydroxide-coordinated MOF (NNU-15)
containing two hydroxide ions [NNU-15, Co(OH)2(H2O)2(Co-TIPP)],
composed of Co(II) ions and TIPP linkers [90]. This framework serves as
a crystal model to simulate the surface state of the catalyst in the alkaline
environment of ECR, and the study further explores its adsorption and
activation mechanism with CO2 (Fig. 17). The TIPP ([5,10,15,20-tetra
(4-imidazole-1-yl)phenyl]porphyrin) ligand, modified by imidazole
groups, is employed to construct more stable MOFs. Additionally, the
TIPP ligand, including the porphyrin moiety, is believed to facilitate
efficient electron conduction, thereby promoting the construction of
highly efficient MOF catalysts for electrochemical applications. The re-
(cid:0)
sults demonstrated that NNU-15, featuring OH
coordination, exhibits a
high FECO of up to 99.2 % at (cid:0) 0.6 V vs. RHE, along with long-term
stability (110 h). It maintains performance exceeding 96 % over a
wide potential range from (cid:0) 0.6 V to (cid:0) 0.9 V, surpassing all reported
MOF-based electrocatalysts. A significant discovery in this work is the
acquisition of the accurate structure of NNU-15-CO2 during the ECR
process, revealing the cooperative role of OH– with the Co active center
(cid:0)
in NNU-15 to capture CO2 and activate it to form HCO3
then
chelates the metal active center, giving rise to NNU-15-CO2. Moreover,
(cid:0)
the study results demonstrate that the coordinated OH
on the metal
active center is crucial for the chemical adsorption of CO2, and its
(cid:0)
may be a necessary pathway for ECR, further
transformation into HCO3
enhancing ECR performance under alkaline conditions.

Regarding derivatives of Co-based MOF, Zhang et al. synthesized a
novel mixed-metal MOF [Ag4Co2(pyz)PDC4][Ag2Co(pyz)2PDC2], which
was transformed into Ag-doped Co3O4 catalyst [91]. This catalyst
exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for the reduction of

CO2 in water to syngas (H2+CO). The as-prepared Ag/Co3O4 material
demonstrated high selectivity for CO in a 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution
(CO2 saturated), achieving a corresponding FE of up to 55.6 %. In
comparison, the maximum FE of CO for pure Co3O4 was 21.3 % at (cid:0) 1.8
V vs. SCE. This result indicated that the presence of Ag significantly
enhances the production of CO, thereby suppressing the generation of
H2. Furthermore, the stability of the Ag/Co3O4 catalyst at (cid:0) 1.8 V vs. SCE
could be maintained for over 10 h. Additionally, by varying the potential
values, the production ratio between H2 and CO can be controlled.

4.3. Ni MOF/-derived electrocatalysts

In carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, the presence of nickel atoms
serves to lower the energy pathway, thereby enhancing the selectivity of
CO2 conversion to CO [92]. Consequently, nickel-based materials are
considered potential catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. In
2016, Su et al. reported an inorganic Ni-based catalyst (Ni–N-graphene
oxide, Ni–N-Gr) for high-performance electrocatalytic CO2 reduction,
elucidating the impact of Ni and N on the selectivity of CO2 reduction
[93]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and extended x-ray ab-
sorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses revealed that the Ni–N site was
the active center for CO2 reduction. The Ni–N-Gr displayed excellent
performance for ECR with a FE for CO of 90 % at (cid:0) 0.7 to (cid:0) 0.9 V versus
RHE.

Zhao et al. synthesized a catalyst containing single Ni sites for effi-
cient electroreduction of CO2 (Fig. 18) [94]. The synthesis based on
ionic exchange of Zn nodes and adsorbed Ni salts within the cavities of
the MOF. The results showed that Ni and N were homogeneously
dispersed on the whole structure. The monatomic catalyst Ni SAs/N–C

chemical reduction of CO2. At an overpotential of 0.89 V (vs. RHE), the
FE for CO generation exceeds 71.9 % with a current density of 10.48 mA
(cid:0) 2. The catalyst also demonstrated sustained stability over a contin-
cm
uous operation period of 60 h, with no discernible deterioration in both
FE and current density observed. The significantly enhanced CO2
reduction performance of Ni SAs/N–C may be attributed to the increased
number of surface-active sites, reduced adsorption energy of CO on in-
dividual Ni sites, and improved electronic conductivity. However, Ni
SAs/N–C also exhibits competitive activity for the HER [95,96], sub-
stantially suppressing the high FE for CO production. Achieving both

To improve the selectivity and current density of electrocatalytic CO2
reduction, Yi et al. incorporated the nickel-phthalocyanine motif (NiPc)
into a conductive porous 2D MOF nanosheet material (NiPc-NiO4,
Fig. 19) for the efficient production of CO in aqueous solution [97]. In
contrast to traditional carboxylate-based MOFs, the constructed MOF
NiPc-NiO4, where the planar NiPc architecture was bridged by
nickel-catecholates, exhibited good electrical conductivity due to the
high d-π orbital overlap between the nickel node and the catechol. As a
result,
as-synthesized NiPc-NiO4 nanosheets demonstrated
outstanding electrocatalytic performance for ECR, achieving a FE for CO
of 98.4 % at (cid:0) 1.2 V vs. RHE, with a partial current density of 34.5 mA
(cid:0) 1. The material maintained excellent
cm
long-term stability, retaining a FE for CO of 86 % after a 10-h chro-
noamperometry test. Additionally, density functional theory calcula-
tions confirmed that the nickel in the phthalocyanine center served as
the active site, and NiPc-NiO4 outperforms NiPc-OH due to its rapid
electron transfer capability and exceptional reducibility.

4.4. Zn MOF/-derived electrocatalysts

Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) constitute an important
subclass of MOFs characterized by zeolite-like topologies formed
through the coordination of metal ions with imidazolate ligands. Due to
their substantial specific surface area, tunable porosity, and custom-
izable functionalities, ZIFs have found extensive applications in catalysis
[98–102], adsorption [103,104], separation [105–107], energy storage
[108–110], and various other fields [111–113]. The development of
efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts is critical to enabling prac-
tical implementation of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction at scale. ZIFs
offer some advantageous attributes for this application as they can be
synthesized in large quantities through an aqueous, room-temperature
approach using the economically viable ligand 2-methylimidazole.
These characteristics of ZIF synthesis facilitate their utilization in elec-
trocatalytic CO2 reduction processes. Among the diverse ZIF variants,
ZIF-8 has garnered significant attention as an electrode material in ap-
plications such as supercapacitors [114], water electrolysis [115], and
photocatalysis [116]. Yamauchi et al. have documented the efficacy of
ZIF-8 as a porous electrode material for supercapacitors, showcasing
significant electrochemical capacitance and stability [117]. Addition-
ally, ZIF-8 exhibits high CO2 adsorption capabilities, presenting a
valuable attribute for CO2 electrochemical reduction [118,119]. In light

of these characteristics, Wang et al. employed various zinc sources
(ZnSO4, Zn(NO3)2, and Zn(AC)2) to synthesize several ZIF-8 nano-
materials, which were utilized for the first time in the investigation of
the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 in aqueous media [120]. Among
them, ZIF-8 synthesized using ZnSO4 demonstrated optimal catalytic
activity, achieving a FE of 65 % for CO production during CO2 electro-
reduction at (cid:0) 1.8V vs. SCE. The results indicated that the active cata-
lytic center is attributed to the discrete zinc nodes within ZIF-8.
Additionally, the impact of electrolytes on enhancing CO selectivity was
(cid:0)
investigated. Chloride ions (Cl
) exhibited superior CO2 reduction
(cid:0)
(cid:0)
reactivity compared to ClO4
, possibly due to their smaller
and HCO3
hydrated radius and facile anion exchange. Subsequently, Jiang et al.
evaluated the performance of ZIFs including ZIF-8, ZIF-108, ZIF-7, and
SIM-1 for ECR in aqueous electrolyte [121]. These frameworks shared

the same SOD (sodalite) topology but have different organic ligands.
Among the four ZIF catalysts, ZIF-8 exhibited the highest FE of 81.0 %
for CO at (cid:0) 1.1 V (vs. RHE), while ZIF-108 achieved the highest CO
(cid:0) 2 at (cid:0) 1.3 V (vs. RHE). In situ X-ray ab-
current density of 12.8 mA cm
sorption spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory
calculations indicated that the imidazolate ligands coordinated with the
Zn(II) center in ZIFs serve as active sites for ECR, determining the FECO
and current density on ZIFs.

Researchers have observed that, the primary electrocatalytic active
sites in MOFs or Zn-based complexes for the CO2 reduction reaction are
typically not the metal centers but rather the ligands coordinating with
the Zn center, as the 3d orbitals of Zn(II) are fully occupied [121,122].
On the other hand, electron-rich active centers have been demonstrated
to facilitate the activation of CO2 molecules. This is achieved by

augmenting the movement of electrons from the active sites to the an-
tibonding orbitals of CO2, concurrently coupling with protons to form
*COOH, a key intermediate for CO production [123,124]. To this end,
Dou et al. proposed a novel strategy involving ligand doping to intro-
duce additional electron density at the ligand sites of ZIFs to boost the
activity of MOFs towards CO2 reduction [125]. In this study, 1,10-phe-
nanthroline, a molecule with strong electron-donating capabilities, was
doped into ZIF-8, leading to an increased electron density at adjacent
active sites (sp2 C atoms in the imidazole ligand), thereby facilitating the
formation of *COOH. Compared to the pristine ZIF-8, the modified ZIF-8
exhibited significantly enhanced activity in ECR with a FECO selectivity
reaching 90.57 % at (cid:0) 1.1 V vs. RHE. Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations revealed that the sp2 C atoms in the doped ZIF remained the
primary active sites for ECR. The enhanced electron-donating capability
of the doped ligand 1,10-phenanthroline, facilitated charge transfer
from the phenanthroline molecule to the adjacent sp2 C atoms in the
imidazolate ligand. This process resulted in stronger electron movement
from the active sites to the antibonding orbitals of CO2, promoting
*COOH formation, and thereby enhancing its activity in ECR.

Existing studies have demonstrated that pyrolyzed porous ZIFs can
afford cost-effective nitrogen-doped carbons (N–Cs) that serve as effi-
cient materials for supercapacitors and electrocatalysts for the oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) [126–130]. As a result, researchers hypothe-
size that pyrolyzed ZIFs enriched with pyridinic nitrogen may selec-
tively catalyze the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO. From this,
Guo et al. fabricated stable nitrogen-doped porous carbon through the
pyrolysis of ZIFs
supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes
(ZIF-MWCNT) for highly selective electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to
CO in aqueous solution (Fig. 20) [131]. Loading furfuryl alcohol (FA)
into ZIF-CNT was undertaken to augment the carbon content of the

pyrolyzed ZIFs. Ultimately, the resulting pyrolyzed ZIF catalysts, deno-
ted as ZIF-CNT-FA-p, exhibited remarkable properties for ECR. At an
overpotential of 740 mV, the FE approached 100 % with a current
(cid:0) 2. These results underscore the pivotal role
density reached 7.7 mA cm
of the MWCNT support material in achieving exceptional catalytic
performance. This enhancement is attributed to the improved electron
transport on the MWCNT network and the rapid CO2 transport facili-
tated by the mesoporous structure constructed by the MWCNTs.
Furthermore, he introduction of iron (Fe) into the hybrid catalyst further
reduced the overpotential of CO2 reduction to 440 mV, achieving a
(cid:0) 2 and a FE of 97 % for CO. Zheng et al.
current density of 2 mA cm
successfully synthesized highly efficient and stable nitrogen-doped
nanoporous carbon (NC) catalysts for CO2 electroreduction by subject-
ing ZIF-8 to varied calcination temperatures in an argon environment
[132]. The findings revealed that NC catalysts prepared at elevated
pyrolysis temperatures exhibited superior CO2 electroreduction activity.
Under optimized conditions, the NC catalyst demonstrated high selec-
tivity, achieving a FECO of 95.4 % at (cid:0) 0.5 V vs. RHE. Remarkably, the
catalyst exhibited prolonged stability over a 20-h operation, maintain-
ing FECO above 90 %. Analysis demonstrated that higher pyrolysis
temperature led to a reduction in total nitrogen content while influ-
encing the nature and density of nitrogen defects. DFT calculations
further confirmed that the elevated pyrolysis temperature promoted the
formation of low-multiple pyridinic nitrogen, thereby providing more
efficient active sites and enhancing the catalyst’s overall activity.

4.5. Other metal-based MOF (Re, In) electrocatalysts

Indium is a non-toxic metallic element, and indium oxide, indium
sulfide, and indium complexes have been investigated for CO2 reduc-
tion. However, they exhibit elevated overpotentials and limited long-
term stability in the research conducted so far. Hou et al. successfully
synthesized a three-dimensional porous indium-based 1,4-benzenedi-
carboxylate (In-BDC) MOF using hydrothermal synthesis with indium
salt and terephthalic acid (H2BDC) (Fig. 21) [133]. The research dem-
onstrates that under the influence of the In-BDC electrocatalyst, CO2 is
effectively reduced to formic acid. At the optimal voltage of (cid:0) 0.669 V
(vs. RHE), the FE of formic acid reaches 88 %, with a current density of
(cid:0) 2. Furthermore, at (cid:0) 1.069 V (vs. RHE), the TOF of the
6.49 mA cm
(cid:0) 1. Notably, the In-BDC catalyst
In-BDC catalyst is measured at 4798 h
exhibits outstanding long-term stability and repeatability.

Ye et al. pioneered the synthesis of a highly oriented surface-grafted
metal-organic framework (SURMOF) thin film based on rhenium (Re)
using a liquid-phase epitaxy method, with a conductive fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) electrode as the substrate [134]. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) characterization and DFT calculations unequivocally verified the
two-dimensional sheet-like structure of the film oriented along the [001]
direction, perpendicular to the FTO electrode surface. In contrast to

molecular catalysts utilizing Re-linkers, the Re-SURMOF-based elec-
trode demonstrated remarkable efficiency and selectivity for CO2
reduction to CO. The FE for CO products reached an impressive 93 ± 5 %
at a potential of (cid:0) 1.6 V vs. NHE, surpassing reported values for COF thin
films and other MOF thin film-based systems. Furthermore, DFT calcu-
lations illustrated that the oriented nature of SURMOFs offers advan-
tages in charge transport, facilitating optimal film growth for efficient
charge transfer from the electrode to the Re-based redox catalyst. The
electrocatalytic performance with various transition metals MOF-based
catalysts for ECR are shown in Table 3.

5. Bimetallic MOF/-derived electrocatalysts

Leveraging bimetallic clusters holds promise for constructing MOFs
featuring dual-metal active sites, an approach that can significantly
augment electrocatalytic efficacy. This enhanced performance stems
from the synergistic electronic interactions among diverse metal centers,

which enable fine-tuning of their structures and surface characteristics
to optimize catalysis. Furthermore, incorporating redox-active organic

that substantially improve electrical conductivity, thus boosting CO2
reduction performance [135]. Zhou et al. designed and synthesized a

Mechanistic studies further affirmed the role of [NiS4] as a CO2 binding
site and an efficient catalytic center. This study provides crucial insights
into the conversion of CO2 into high-value chemicals.

Ren et al. innovatively presented a study on the efficacy of isolated
diatomic Ni–Fe sites immobilized on nitrogenated carbon as an efficient
electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction [137]. The catalyst demonstrated
remarkable selectivity, achieving a CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 90
% across a broad potential range spanning from (cid:0) 0.5 to (cid:0) 0.9 V (with a
peak of 98 % at (cid:0) 0.7 V), along with notable durability, as evidenced by
retaining 99 % of its initial selectivity after 30 h of electrolysis. Density
functional theory investigations elucidated that the neighboring Ni–Fe
centers synergistically lower the reaction barrier for COOH* formation
and CO desorption, while also undergoing distinctive structural trans-
formations into a CO-adsorbed moiety upon CO2 absorption. Further-
more, Rashid et al. incorporated bimetallic Ni and Fe into the MOF
structure, emphasizing the pivotal role of the synergistic effect between
the bimetallic elements and surrounding nitrogen atoms in the electro-
catalytic reduction of CO2 [138]. The engineered Ni–Fe MOF features
moieties surrounded by four nitrogen atoms through covalent bonding,
resembling porphyrin-based molecular units and serving as an effective
homogeneous CO2 reduction electrocatalyst. Operating under an
applied potential of (cid:0) 0.5 V versus the RHE, the constructed MOF
demonstrated an impressive FE for CO (FECO) of up to 98.2 %, while
maintaining stability over a period of 30 h. These findings represent a
promising avenue for the development and optimization of MOF-based
electrocatalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO2.

Ma et al. employed a rapid and facile ultrasonic-assisted method to
synthesize well-dispersed Zn–Ni bimetallic MOFs, followed by a pyrol-
ysis treatment to successfully yield Ni–N-doped porous interconnected
carbon (NiNPIC) [139]. The cavitation effects of ultrasound induced
instantaneous high pressure and temperature, expediting the nucleation
of Zn2+
, and MeIm to form interconnected Zn–Ni bimetallic MOFs
precursors, thereby creating cross-linked hierarchical porous structures.
Precise control over the Ni loading in NiNPIC was achieved by adjusting
the Ni dosage in the bimetallic MOF precursors, ranging from 0.62 wt%
to 5.26 wt%. The optimized catalyst exhibited efficient electroreduction
of CO2 to CO with a FE of 95.1 %, a substantial current density of 10.2
(cid:0) 1 (36.1

possible pathways for the CO2 reduction reaction and unveiled the
structure-property relationship of the catalyst. The study highlighted
that the as-prepared catalyst featured a high surface area and inter-
connected porous structure, providing efficient mass diffusion pathways

to highly accessible Ni–N sites. This, in turn, facilitated improved elec-
tron transfer, reduced interface resistance, and enhanced electrolyte/gas
transport in ECR, resulting in highly efficient ECR performance. To
improve the performance of molecular catalysts in an electrochemical
CO2 reduction system, Yang et al. synthesized a hybrid catalyst
CoTAPc-ZIF-90 by incorporating Co phthalocyanine onto the external
surface of ZIF-90 through a Schiff base reaction [140]. The electro-
catalytic efficacy of CO2 reduction is synergistically improved by the
ZIF-90 substrate and Co active center. CoTAPc-ZIF-90 exhibited a
(cid:0) 2, facilitating the efficient reduc-
notable current density of 13 mA cm
tion of CO2 to CO in an aqueous solution at a potential of (cid:0) 0.97 V vs.
RHE with an excellent FECO of 90 %. Furthermore, the catalyst dem-
onstrates superior stability compared to the free phthalocyanine
molecule.

Meng et al. systematically designed four structural analogs of
conductive 2D metallophthalocyanine (MPc)
ligand-based MOFs,
employing Cu nodes for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. The
catalytic performance of these MOFs was intricately governed by two
crucial structural factors: the metal within the MPc (M = Co vs. Ni)
catalytic subunit and the identity of the heteroatomic cross-linkers be-
tween these subunits (X = O vs. NH) (Fig. 23) [141]. The selection of the
metal within MPcs primarily dictated catalytic activity and selectivity,
further modulated by the nature of the heteroatomic linkages. Among
these MOFs, CoPc-Cu-O demonstrated the highest selectivity towards
CO production (FECO = 85 %), achieving a substantial current density of
(cid:0) 2 at (cid:0) 0.63 V (vs. RHE) when prepared as a composite
(cid:0) 17.3 mA cm
with carbon black at a 1:1 mass ratio. Remarkably, without using any
conductive additives, direct utilization of CoPc-Cu-O as an electrode

material yielded a current density of (cid:0) 9.5 mA cm
Mechanistic studies highlighted the predominant catalytic role of the Cu
nodes in the MPc center. DFT calculations further suggested that,
compared with NiPc-based and NH-linked analogs, CoPc-based and
O-linked MOFs exhibited lower activation energies in the formation of
carboxyl
intermediates, consistent with their higher activities and
selectivity. The findings of this study underscore the substantial poten-
tial of using 2D MPc-based conductive framework materials for
achieving efficient CO2 reduction through strategic ligand engineering
across multiple tunable dimensions.

Saranya et al. presented an innovative approach involving the one-
step carbonization of a bimetallic MOF (CuxZn100(cid:0) x-MOF-74) to syn-
thesize a catalyst supported on a conductive porous carbon material,
subsequently applied in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to produce
C2 products, including ethylene and ethanol [142]. The study unveiled a
noteworthy impact on the FE and current density for C2 compounds with
the introduction of Zn into Cu as an alloy. The CuZn alloy, characterized
by intimate surface contact between Cu and Zn atoms in Cu75Zn25–C,

an FE of 25 %, a fivefold increase compared to Cu–C at (cid:0) 1.0 V vs. RHE.
The presence of Zn not only locally generated CO but also influenced the
electronic structure of Cu sites, thereby enhancing the activity of elec-
trochemical CO2 conversion to C2 products. This work elucidated how
CuZn enhances the formation of C2 products and demonstrated the
applicability of utilizing MOFs to fabricate electrocatalysts with tunable
properties for ECR.

Xue et al. innovatively developed a novel Cu/Bi bimetallic catalyst
derived from MOFs through a hydrothermal synthesis combined with
high-temperature calcination under a nitrogen atmosphere [143]. The
resulting catalyst showcased a cylindrical morphology composed of
bimetallic nanoparticles. This study revealed that the Cu/Bi bimetallic
system effectively lowered the activation energy barrier of CO2 and
(cid:0)
exhibited a stronger adsorption capability for the CO2
intermediate
compared to the Cu-free reference Bi/Bi2O3@C. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that the synergistic coordination
of Bi0 and Bi3+
in the catalyst enhanced the performance of the CO2
reduction reaction. The optimized Cu1–Bi/Bi2O3@C exhibited excellent
selectivity towards HCOOH, with a FE exceeding 84 % within the po-
tential range of (cid:0) 0.84 to (cid:0) 1.14 V vs. RHE and reaching 93 % at (cid:0) 0.94 V
vs. RHE. The electrocatalytic performance of catalysts derived from

bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives for ECR are shown in Table 4.

6. MOFs-based single-atom electrocatalysts

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered substantial research
attention in the ECR field due to their distinctive electronic configura-
tions and optimal atomic utilization [144–146]. MOFs emerge as an
appealing alternative for M-SAC precursors, given their highly adaptable
structures and functionalization flexibility. Nevertheless, existing syn-
thetic methodologies are limited by the prerequisite for MOFs to possess
abundant nitrogen atoms, exemplified by ZIFs [94,147–150] and por-
phyrinic MOFs [94,146,151,152]. Within the ZIF series, ZIF-8 has
garnered significant attention owing to the ease of preparation and
tunability of its metal nodes. These properties enhance its catalytic
performance, establishing it as an optimal template for the synthesis of
SACs [153]. Chen et al. prepared a series of ZIF-8-derived cobalt SACs
(C–Co–ZIFs) with different grinding processes to investigate the impact
of the grinding degrees on the performance of the electrochemical
reduction reaction of ECR [154]. Following moderate grinding, the
catalyst achieved a maximum FECO of approximately 60 % at (cid:0) 0.55 V
vs. RHE (representing an increase of about 15 % compared to the orig-
inal C–Co-ZIF), and demonstrated a current density that was twice that

techniques

Gong et al. proposed a universal host-guest cooperative protection
strategy, utilizing nitrogen-free MOFs as precursors, to successfully
synthesize a series of SACs
[155]. The researchers employed
solvent-thermal
to synthesize nitrogen-free bimetallic
MgNi-MOF-74 as a precursor, introducing magnesium to extend the
spatial distance between adjacent Ni atoms. Additionally, pyrrole mol-
ecules were introduced into the pores of MgNi-MOF-74, and under
iodine (I2) conditions, pyrrole underwent polymerization to form poly-
pyrrole (PPy) molecules. Using PPy as a nitrogen source to stabilize Ni
atoms separated during the pyrolysis process of MgNi-MOF-74, a series
of single-atom catalysts Ni-SACs (NiSA-Nx-C; x = 2, 3, 4) with varying
nitrogen coordination numbers were obtained by adjusting the pyrolysis
temperature (Fig. 24). Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction results revealed
that the current density of the NiSA-N2-C catalyst is significantly higher
than that of NiSA-N3-C and NiSA-N4-C. At (cid:0) 0.8 V vs. RHE, the FE of
NiSA-N2-C for CO production from CO2 electroreduction was 98 %,
surpassing NiSA-N3-C and NiSA-N4-C. Additionally, the turnover fre-
(cid:0) 1, also higher than that of
quency (TOF) of NiSA-N2-C is 1622 h
NiSA-N3-C and NiSA-N4-C. These findings indicate that NiSA-N2-C with
the lowest nitrogen coordination number exhibits superior electro-
catalytic performance for CO2 reduction. Simultaneously, the stability of
the NiSA-N2-C catalyst was tested at (cid:0) 0.8 V vs. RHE, showing no sig-
nificant changes in current density and FE after 10 h of electrolysis,
highlighting the catalyst’s high catalytic stability. Furthermore, theo-
retical calculations demonstrate that the formation free energy of
COOH* (rate-determining step) for NiSA-N2-C (1.42 eV) is lower than
that for NiSA-N3-C (1.45 eV) and NiSA-N4-C (1.73 eV), providing an
explanation for its enhanced catalytic performance.

N-Heterocyclic carbene molecules (NHCs) consist of a cyclic struc-
ture containing at least one N atom and one divalent C atom, forming a
six-electron valence shell [156–158]. As organic ligands, they are
considered ideal modifiers for metal centers due to their ability to form
NHC-metal bonds and their highly modular molecular structure, unique

electronic properties, and distinctive spatial characteristics [159,160].
NHCs have been recognized as effective additives for functionalizing the
surface of metal materials, enhancing their catalytic performance in the
ECR. However, the application of NHC-coordinated metal single-atom
sites (SAS) in electrocatalysis has been limited due to challenges such
as the solubility, product separation, and long-term stability of homo-
geneous NHC-metal complexes.

Chen et al. integrated N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-ligated copper
single-atom site (2Bn-Cu) into a porous MOF to fabricate a novel, high-
performance electrocatalyst, denoted as 2Bn-Cu@UiO-67, designed for
the electrochemical synthesis of CH4 [161]. The NHCs serve as
anchoring ligands for the Cu single-atom site, establishing metal-carbon
bonds and functioning as the catalytic centers for ECR. Concurrently, the
electron-donating nature of NHCs enhances the metal surface charge
density, thereby optimizing the adsorption of CHO* intermediates
crucial for CH4 formation. Furthermore, the porous MOF matrix not only
augments the capture capacity for CO2 molecules but also furnishes
numerous microreaction chambers, facilitating the diffusion of CO2 to-
wards the 2Bn-Cu sites situated within the interconnected MOF pores.
This synergistic effect significantly amplifies the efficiency of ECR re-
actions. Experimental outcomes reveal that 2Bn-Cu@UiO-67 attains
methane FE of up to 81 % at (cid:0) 1.5 V vs. RHE, accompanied by a corre-

Zhang et al. devised a straightforward and innovative approach to
develop a catalytic system comprised of single Bi atoms on nitrogen-
doped carbon networks (Bi SAs/NC) with hierarchical porosity for
efficient CO2 reduction (Fig. 25) [162]. The study employed a facile
thermal emission and adsorption strategy, sequentially placing Bi-based
metal-organic framework (Bi-MOF) and dicyandiamide (DCD) in a
porcelain boat under an argon flow to synthesize the Bi single-atom
catalyst. The catalyst exhibited high intrinsic CO2 reduction activity
for CO conversion, with a high Faraday efficiency (FECO up to 97 %) and

ory revealed that the preeminent active site for both CO2 activation and
the swift generation of crucial intermediate COOH* for CO products is
the single-atom Bi–N4 site, characterized by a low free energy barrier.

7.1. Metal cluster functionalization

7. Design principles of MOF electrocatalysts

Achieving the full potential of MOF-based electrocatalysts necessi-
tates a rational, systematic approach to design and synthesis. Within the
domain of MOF engineering, it is feasible to introduce novel function-
alities into the framework while retaining structural integrity. During in-
situ MOF fabrication, prudent selection of metal nodes and strategic
design of multi-functional organic linkers are critical. This allows tar-
geted tuning of electronic and catalytic properties. Moreover, post-
synthetic modification methods provide opportunities to enhance the
inherent electrocatalytic activity of MOF platforms. Deliberate alter-
ations after initial synthesis enable optimized performance for CO2
reduction applications.

Within MOFs, active sites located on exposed metal centers and
coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUSs) play a vital role driving elec-
trocatalytic CO2 conversion [163]. The selected metal node determines
product distributions, for example, Cu favors C2+ hydrocarbons while Bi
yields formate selectively. Enhancing the performance of these active
sites can boost the overall catalyst activity. As catalytic reactions occur
on the catalyst surface, surface-exposed active sites are deemed more
dependable. Strategies for augmenting MOF active sites primarily
involve increasing the quantity of active sites and enhancing intrinsic
activity. In MOF structures, the coordination number (CN) of metal ions
often constrains the catalytic performance, while coordinatively unsat-
urated sites (CUSs) are considered more active catalytic reaction sites
[164,165]. Therefore, constructing geometric structures with ample
CUSs, commonly referred to as vacancy-defect engineering, is urgently
needed to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of MOFs. Addi-
tionally, eliminating ligand portions through ligand engineering on

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10117523

Z. Chen et al.

MOFs to create ultra-thin MOFs with larger exposed surfaces and
generating dangling bonds may be advantageous for enhancing active
sites on MOFs. Hence, to boost the catalytic activity of MOFs, geometric
structures with numerous CUSs must be developed. In catalytic pro-
cesses, reduced coordination numbers or CUSs can serve as active sites
that are more easily accessible to reactants. Despite the relatively low
density of these active sites, they represent an emerging strategy for
improving the catalytic activity of MOFs. Moreover, compared to
single-metal-site catalysts, multi-metal-site catalysts exhibit better cat-
alytic performance for ECR [37]. Therefore, introducing various syner-
gistic metal centers into MOFs is also an important strategy for
enhancing the selectivity of ECR products.

7.2. Linker functionalization

Metal centers are typically regarded as the active sites for ECR within
MOFs, with the coordination of functional organic ligands capable of
fine-tuning the electronic structure of these metal centers to enhance
catalytic performance. For instance, porphyrin-based molecular elec-
trocatalysts have found widespread application in ECR [166]. Intro-
ducing electroactive porphyrin molecules during MOF synthesis not
only enhances electron transfer capability but also augments the
intrinsic conductivity of the MOF. Moreover, the design and synthesis of
organic ligands with delocalized large π-bonds, such as tetrahydrox-
yquinone (THQ) [53], triptycene [54], and HHTP [57], can be employed
to fabricate conductive MOFs.

Increasing the charge density at active sites is an effective strategy
for enhancing ECR performance. In this regard, the ligand doping stra-
tegies have been proposed to induce higher electron density at MOF
coordination sites. The doping of redox-active ligands confers robust
electron-donating capabilities to the MOF, thereby instigating addi-
tional charge density at neighboring pristine ligand sites and enhancing
charge transfer within the MOF, thereby improving ECR activity.
Furthermore, doped ligands can serve as co-active sites for ECR. The
adsorption and activation of linear CO2 molecules by electron-rich –OH
groups introduced into the MOF structure are identified as crucial steps.
These diverse strategies, encompassing structural and electronic effects
in MOF design, provide valuable insights for the rational enhancement
of MOF electrocatalytic performance.

7.3. Post-synthetic functionalization

In addition to the aforementioned methodologies for modifying the
inherent structural properties of MOFs via alterations in metal ions and
organic ligands, post-synthetic modifications offer another effective
avenue for imbuing MOFs with high-performance capabilities. Post-
synthetic strategies primarily involve high-temperature pyrolysis and
electrochemical conversion, yielding MOF-derived materials that retain
the intrinsic porosity and specific surface area of MOFs while enhancing
stability and conductivity. As a result, materials derived from MOF
precursors have garnered increased appeal for use in catalytic applica-
tions pertaining to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Studies have shown
that the efficacy of MOF-derived catalysts can be tailored by controlling
three key parameters: annealing temperature, pyrolysis duration, and
pyrolysis atmosphere (air/inert). Moreover, the presence of guest spe-
cies in MOFs may introduce additional functionalities, such as hetero-
atom doping and the integration of metal nanoparticles. Among these
materials derived from MOFs, those incorporating metal nanoparticles,
N-doped graphene carbon materials featuring single-metal atom coor-
dination, and/or metal-free catalysts offer distinct advantages for elec-
trocatalytic CO2 reduction. These advantages include robust electrical
conductivity, expanded specific surface area, and homogeneous
dispersion of nanoparticles or single-atom active sites.

8. Structure–performance relationships in MOF/-derived
electrocatalysts

Emerging studies have elucidated important structure-performance
relationships that govern the efficacy of MOF/-based catalysts in elec-
trocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions (ECR). Based on existing reports,
several intrinsic factors within the MOF framework appear to primarily
dictate catalytic behavior. Firstly, the nature and dispersion of incor-
porated metal active sites display a dominant influence on activity,
selectivity, and reaction overpotential. The choice of catalytic metal
centers, along with their oxidation state and coordination environment,
strongly control surface energetics and adsorption preferences. Sec-
ondly, the organic ligands comprising the MOFs backbone play a syn-
ergistic role through modifications like functionalization or extended
ligands. This introduces variability in electronic structure that can fine-
tune adsorption energies and thus impact critical kinetic factors. The
geometry and connectivity of organic linkers also influences mass
transport considerations. Lastly, tuning the microscale morphology and
nanoscale features of the catalytic materials, such as size, dispersion,
and mesoporosity/macroporosity, can help optimize electrical conduc-
tivity, surface/interfacial areas, and diffusion limitations - collectively
shaping overall catalytic flux.

8.1. Metal active sites

Materials derived from MOFs offer a higher exposure of active sites
in comparison to conventional electrocatalysts, thus enhancing the ef-
ficiency of catalytic processes. The binding energy between metal active
sites in MOFs and intermediates of the CO2 reduction reaction, such as
*CO, *OCH, and *COOH, plays a pivotal role in the formation and
selectivity of reaction products. For instance, the metal Bi exhibits a
specific binding affinity towards COOH* and *OCHO intermediates,
facilitating the highly selective production of HCOOH. Meanwhile, Cu,
as a unique metal node, demonstrates a negative *CO adsorption energy
and positive *H adsorption energy, resulting in diverse product distri-
butions in Cu-based MOFs during ECR [167]. In the PcCu-Cu-O MOF, the
CuO4 unit serves as an active site for CO formation, while the CuPc unit
exhibits higher adsorption energy towards *CO, favoring its hydroge-
nation to *CHO [56]. Additionally, CuO5 units exhibit stronger
adsorption of CO compared to CuO4, facilitating CH4 generation [57].
The adsorption and initial activation of CO2 by catalysts are crucial for
the catalytic activity and selectivity towards C2+ products in the initial
step of ECR. Halogen ions can enhance CO2 adsorption, and introducing
halogens into MOFs can improve catalyst performance [60]. Theoretical
calculations indicate that catalyst surface defects are the primary active
sites for ECR. For instance, Cu2+
defect sites exhibit a strong binding
affinity towards CO2, promoting the formation of active species
Cu-MOF*OOCH, thereby enhancing the selectivity towards HCOOH
[38]. The introduction of bimetallic sites or composite nanoparticles can
enhance the activity, selectivity, and stability of MOFs-based catalysts
through electronic structure effects, bimetallic site cooperation effects,
and interface effects. Precise control of the proportion of bimetallic
components, synergistic effects between MOFs and composites, and
precise preparation of specific structures at micro and macro levels,
benchmarked against the performance of pure metal components, can
effectively improve the conductivity, stability, and number of active
sites in MOFs-based catalysts.

8.2. Functional organic ligands

The organic ligands composing MOF frameworks play an integral
role in dictating catalytic function. Through rational ligand engineering
coordinated with optimized metal centers, it is possible to deliberately
tune electrocatalytic efficiency. For instance, the introduction of hy-
droxyl and other H-bond donor moieties can stabilize ECR-active in-
termediates (such as *COOH, *CHO, and *CO) through the formation of

Z. Chen et al.

hydrogen bonds with them [76]. This anchoring effect markedly im-
proves catalytic performance by lowering associated transition state
energies. Likewise, incorporating redox-active ligands such as porphy-
rins or phenanthrolines presents opportunities to subtly tailor electronic
structure within the MOF [125]. Increasing effective donor or acceptor
abilities can enhance intrinsic electronic conductivity, electron transfer
kinetics, and facilitate surface reducibility, all parameters that influence
catalytic activity and durability.

Early studies have demonstrated the potency of such ligand-based
design tactics, but much remains to be elucidated regarding structure-
property relationships. Continued exploration across organic building
block chemistries and motif geometries holds promise to reveal new
electrocatalytic design principles. Rational tuning of ligands coordi-
nated with optimized metal sites shows potential to substantially
improve carbon dioxide conversion efficiency using MOF catalysts.

8.3. Catalyst morphology

[67,69]. When

The morphology of electrocatalytic materials plays a vital role in
determining their catalytic performance. Nanoparticles with reduced
size and uniform dispersion facilitate efficient charge transfer processes.
However, the inherent structural lability of many MOF materials poses a
challenge, as electrocatalytic operations can damage catalytic sites and
frameworks over time, reducing durability. To address this issue, re-
searchers have increasingly adopted post-synthetic modification strate-
gies, such as electrochemical etching and pyrolytic treatment, to prepare
various nanomaterial derivatives directly from MOF precursors [68,72,
74]. These approaches offer an opportunity to enhance the chemical
resilience of MOF-based catalysts in acidic and alkaline solution envi-
ronments through morphological control at the nanoscale. Notable ex-
amples include generating MOF-templated nanoparticles or clusters
with structural encapsulation, offering protection to the catalytically
active
such
post-modification tactics have been shown to greatly improve the
longevity and stability of MOF electrocatalysts under operative condi-
tions. At the same time, the nanoscale features imparted through these
methods also facilitate enhanced mass and charge transport kinetics,
boosting measured catalytic activity. For instance, bismuth nanosheets
(Bi NSs) electrocatalysts demonstrated a higher current density
compared to bismuth nanoparticles (Bi NPs). This superior performance
was attributed to the double-layer capacitance of Bi NSs being nearly 7
times greater than that of Bi NPs, indicating that the substantially larger
capacitance of Bi NSs can expose a significantly greater electrochemi-
to

[82],
nanosheet-shaped Bi NSs can achieve approximately 92 % faradaic ef-
ficiency for HCOOH (FEHCOOH) at a lower voltage ((cid:0) 0.53 V vs. RHE).
This finding suggests that the morphology of electrocatalysts influences
the accessible electrochemically active surface area, thus impacting the
catalytic efficiency for CO2 electroreduction. As a result, post-synthetic
transformations represent a promising design paradigm that can help
optimize the performance stability tradeoff that has hindered some early
MOF-based catalyst systems. With further optimization, such ap-
proaches may yield next-generation stable-yet-active nanocatalyst
formulations.

8.4. Porosity

MOFs are commonly used as sacrificial templates for synthesizing
high-performance electrocatalysts. Upon thermal treatment, MOFs pre-
cursors yield a range of derivatives including carbon nanostructures,
metal oxides, metal/metal oxide@carbon composites (M/MO@C),
metal carbides (MC), and metal nitrides (MN) [168]. Functionalization
of MOFs-derived electrocatalysts can be achieved during, prior to, or
after pyrolysis. One direct approach involves pyrolyzing MOFs pre-
cursors under inert atmospheres for carbon material synthesis. MOFs are

typically carbonized at high temperatures, decomposing the organic
framework and generating non-metallic carbon [169]. To increase sur-
face area and porosity, metal species may then be removed by evapo-
ration or acid etching. Many carbon products inherit the microporous
profile of the parent MOF, with microporosity enhancement possible
through high-temperature evaporation of nodes like Zn [170]. Mean-
while, metal nanoparticles formed during pyrolysis can be acid-leached
to yield mesopores and micropores alongside carbon. This enhanced
porosity aids rapid charge/mass transport to active sites, thereby aug-
menting the reactivity and catalytic efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2
reduction [171].

8.5. Interaction with non-metallic elements

Enhancing the electrochemical response of carbon-based non-
metallic and non-precious metal catalysts derived from MOFs can be
achieved through heteroatom doping. Elements like nitrogen, phos-
phorous and boron can be introduced to modify catalyst structure and
properties. Compared to singly heteroatom-doped carbons, materials
doped with multiple heteroatoms may more effectively activate carbon
sites, inducing greater defects and active centers to boost electro-
chemical performance. For example, Cheng et al. pyrolyzed nitrogen-
containing benzimidazole-modified Cu MOFs
to yield various
copper@nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu-NC) composites derived from the
C, pyrrolic-N and Cu–N species formed
precursors [70]. Under 400
along carbon sites, supplying abundant adsorption domains for CO2.
This facilitated desirable C–C coupling surface chemistry. Moreover,
pyrolyzing ZIF-CNTS with furfural produced a nitrogen-doped porous
carbon catalyst whose electron transfer kinetics were enhanced [126].
Meanwhile, a mesoporous carbon architecture developed via templating
with MWCNTs, expediting CO2 mass transport. The dual improvements
to adsorption-reaction sites and diffusion dynamics significantly boosted
CO2 electroreduction performance.

◦

MOF-derived materials synthesized from organic-inorganic pre-
cursors undergo a transformative process wherein organic units are
converted into heteroatom-doped carbon frameworks, while metal-
containing units concurrently yield supported transition metal nano-
particles. During pyrolysis, the organic ligands are carbonized and
infused with heteroatoms that modify the electronic structure. Concur-
rently, active transition metal sites are generated and anchored on the
carbon substrate. The interaction between the doped carbon matrix and
embedded metal particles generates a hybrid material containing
numerous interfacial active sites. By optimizing the heteroatom doping
and metal-carbon interface, the catalytic performance can be signifi-
cantly enhanced. These dual modifications to the electronic properties
and surface sites effectively facilitate the adsorption and transformation
of CO2 during electroreduction.

While these internal traits exhibit complex interplay, establishing
clear structure-performance relationships remains an ongoing aim.
Continued exploration of compositional and architectural design spaces
may ultimately reveal design motifs that could aid rational selection of
optimal MOF-based catalyst formulations for diverse ECR applications.

9. Industrialization prospects of MOF electrocatalysts

Over the past two decades, researchers have conceptualized and
synthesized over twenty thousand variants of MOF materials. These
innovative materials have found applications in diverse realms, span-
ning catalysis, adsorption, separation, energy storage, biomedicine, and
beyond. However, despite their vast potential, most of MOF materials
have not transitioned into commercial applications due to challenges
related to stability and synthesis costs. The industrial adoption of MOF
materials encounters substantial hurdles, primarily stemming from the
lack of scalable synthesis methodologies and inadequate stability pro-
files in practical applications.

significantly from those in laboratory settings, with scalability, cost-
effectiveness, and quality control being key parameters for evaluating
the efficacy of industrial synthesis procedures. Among the potential
strategies reported for bulk production of MOFs are alkali-assisted
synthesis [172,173], microwave synthesis [174,175], fluid chemistry
[176], electrochemistry [177,178], supercritical CO2 (ScCO2) [179],
mechanochemical synthesis [180,181], and drying heating [182,183].
Among
to
solvent-thermal synthesis for large-scale production. Compared to batch
production, the primary advantage of fluid chemistry lies in continuous
production, which is advantageous for industrial manufacturing. In
2014, Hill and colleagues reported the earliest application of fluid
chemistry for the production of HKUST-1, UiO-66, and NOTT-400 MOF
products [184]. The reported space-time yield (STY) for these products
(cid:0) 1, with a production rate of
(cid:0) 3 d
ranged from 592 to 4533 kgm
(cid:0) 1. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using
approximately 60 g h
fluid chemistry for MOF production, laying the groundwork for future
endeavors. Around the same time, Schrӧder et al. compared the syn-
thesis of MIL-53(Al) in batch and flow production settings [176]. Fluid
technology proved superior, achieving an STY of 1300 kgm-3 d-1 and
producing 500 g of MIL-53(Al) slurry within 4 h. Additionally, they
demonstrated that the apparatus could easily be adapted for other MOF
types, such as HKUST-1. These studies underscore the practicality and
feasibility of fluid chemistry in various industrial MOF productions.

Another popular strategy involves utilizing supercritical carbon di-
oxide (ScCO2) during the synthesis process. Due to its non-toxic and non-
flammable properties, ScCO2 serves as an ideal solvent for large-scale
chemical production. The process is characterized by scalability, cost-
effectiveness, and the recyclability of ScCO2, making it highly suitable
for industrial applications. Despite its non-polar nature, ScCO2 has been
proven to be suitable as a solvent for MOF synthesis. Joseph et al. syn-
thesized a series of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) using pure
ScCO2, by milling solid reagents and mixing them with ScCO2 during the
process, yielding MOF products in just 5 min [185]. The research team
also scaled up the reaction to produce ZIF-8 in batches of 100 g, further
demonstrating the industrial feasibility of this methodology. In 2020,
Elizabeth et al. employed a similar strategy to produce UiO-66 [186].
They mixed ZrOCl2–8H2O dissolved in DMF and terephthalic acid with
preheated ScCO2 using a fluid device to rapidly form crystalline prod-
ucts. With this apparatus, they produced 8.71 g of UiO-66 in 5 min,
(cid:0) 1, one of the highest reported for
achieving a productivity of 104 g h
UiO-66. These studies indicate the feasibility of using ScCO2 for the
industrial production of MOFs.

Several technologies, as discussed earlier, have transitioned from
theoretical concepts to practical applications, finding utilization in the
commercial manufacturing of MOF products. Among the trailblazers,
BASF emerges as the pioneering corporate entity that recognized the
potential of MOFs, taking the lead in large-scale commercial production
under the trademark Basolite© [187]. BASF marked its entry into
commercial markets by introducing Basolite©C300 (HKUST-1),
employing an electrochemical approach. The company further honed
various solvothermal techniques to scale up the production of diverse
MOFs [188]. In addition to BASF, notable players in the industry include
Strem Chemicals, UK-based MOF Technology, NovoMOF, and NuMat
Technologies. In a significant milestone announced in October 2023,
BASF solidified its position as a chemical giant by becoming the world’s
first company to achieve commercial-scale production of MOF mate-
rials, boasting an annual output reaching several hundred tons. Notably,
BASF highlighted its customization capabilities, allowing the tailoring of
MOF materials to meet specific customer requirements and specifica-
tions across various applications and industries. As advancements in
production methods continue, the cost associated with MOFs is antici-
pated to decrease, enhancing the competitiveness of MOF products in
comparison to alternative materials.

Addressing the challenge posed by intricate and costly synthesis of
conductive organic ligands, several strategic approaches warrant
consideration. Primarily, optimizing synthetic pathways to identify
more efficient and economical methods could streamline steps and
materials use, curtailing expenses. Secondly, exploring the use of
renewable resources or waste materials as precursors offers dual benefits
of reducing costs while promoting sustainability. Furthermore, mini-
mizing reliance on conventional energy-intensive solvothermal tech-
niques in favor of aqueous or mechanochemical syntheses could enable
greener MOF production. Additionally, strategies such as straightfor-
ward post-synthetic modifications or composite formation may allow
fabrication of MOF catalytic systems without requiring complex organic
ligand synthesis. By refining synthetic techniques, sourcing precursors
sustainably, and exploring alternative production methods, the field can
work to mitigate challenges presently limiting widespread industrial and
commercial uptake of MOF technologies. Continuous efforts to simplify
processes while maintaining performance will help realize the potential
of these versatile porous materials.

The stability of pristine MOF materials under working electro-
catalytic conditions is a multifaceted property requiring nuanced
consideration. As with many porous solids, MOF chemical stability
relative to water and moisture is particularly germane, as hydrolysis can
irreparably compromise the organic framework. In electrocatalytic
systems, the chemical milieu encompasses not only water, but also re-
actants, ions, and byproducts of the redox reactions catalyzed. Water
facilitates hydrolysis of metal-linker coordination sites, generating sol-
uble hydroxide/hydrated metal species in basic media or protonated
linkers in acid environments that may diffuse into solution. Gas evolu-
tion byproducts like H2 bubbles can also mechanically and chemically
degrade structure integrity at active sites through localized pressures.
Liquid reduction products such as formate or methanol pose analogous
stability threats if non-innocently adsorbed. Redox reactions on metal
nodes and ligands additionally risk structural disruption, as metal cen-
ters may undergo potential-induced oxidation/reduction state changes
altering coordination. This suggests optimal operating voltage windows
for preserving MOFs integrity require definition. While pristine MOF
conductivities cannot surpass traditional electrocatalysts, Joule heating
effects during high rate reactions risk compromising thermal stability,
highlighting conductivity enhancement needs.

The susceptibility of MOFs to hydrolysis of coordination bonds ren-
ders them generally unstable in water, or even in humid air, posing a
significant obstacle to the realization of industrial applications for
MOFs. In response to this challenge, various post-synthetic processes
have been reported, including hydrophobic surface treatment [189,190]
and oxygen plasma treatment [187]. Although these processes have not
yet been demonstrated on a large scale, they present promising avenues
for addressing the instability of certain types of MOFs, paving the way
for their potential commercialization.

10. Challenges and perspectives

Recent advancements have showcased the potential of MOF elec-
trocatalysts for CO2 reduction. In flow cell reactors, impressive current
(cid:0) 2 have been achieved using Cu clusters
densities of up to 262 mA cm
derived from HKUST-1 [66]. Notably, MOF-based single-atom compos-
ites such as 2Bn-Cu@UiO-67 have surpassed this, reaching significantly
(cid:0) 2 under flow cell condi-
higher current densities of up to 420 mA cm
tions, with a FE of 81 % for methane [161]. According to the reviewed
literature, Cu-based MOFs and their derivatives are presently the most
promising candidates for industrial-scale production, exhibiting high
selectivity in generating various C2+ products during electrocatalytic
CO2 reduction.

However, the current scale of flow cell reactors employed, even in
the most promising Cu-based systems, remains orders of magnitude too
small for commercial viability. Significant challenges include: i) Eco-
nomic barriers arise from the exorbitant capital costs linked to scaling up

bespoke flow cell designs, along with the technical risks posed by the
assembly and mass production complexities of sophisticated micro-
fluidic technologies. ii) Throughput limitations stem from the processing
rates achieved to date, measured in liters-per-hour, which would require
prohibitively large battery-like banks of reactors for ton-scale produc-
tion. Overcoming mass transfer issues at larger scales presents formi-
dable engineering challenges. iii) Stability challenges arise as prolonged
electrocatalytic cycling often results in the degradation of catalytically
active sites within the MOF, attributed to corrosion, defects, or leaching.
Achieving the long catalyst lifetimes required for continuous industrial
use demands revolutionary advances in developing robust architectures.
Addressing these significant obstacles facing MOF electrocatalysts
will require ambitious, concerted scientific efforts. Computational
modeling shows strong potential to rationally design next-generation
MOF frameworks with optimized properties such as exceedingly high
surface areas, tunable porosity, and carbon resistance surpassing the
current HKUST-1 benchmark. While incorporating redox-active ligands
has effectively addressed the inherent poor conductivity of many MOFs,
further advancing activity and stability compared to metal benchmarks
remains challenging. One strategy is to design organic linkers featuring
delocalized π-bonds that facilitate rapid electron transfer throughout the
framework. Introducing metals and metal oxides could also enhance the
dispersion and loading of catalytically active metal sites. This compre-
hensive approach aims to optimize both activity and longevity in MOF
catalysts. In parallel, developing sophisticated characterization tech-
niques like operando spectroscopy is imperative. Real-time tracking of
compositional and structural changes during CO2 electroreduction, and
observation of interactions and energies of reaction intermediates, can
provide crucial molecular insights into mechanism pathways. With a
mechanistic understanding of how site traits impact selectivity and
overpotential, targeted engineering of optimal site densities, geometries
and functionalizations should surpass benchmarks for product yield,
energy efficiency, and current densities. Refined quantitative structure-
performance models could then guide additional design cycles toward
each catalyst’s full capabilities. A cross-disciplinary collaboration inte-
grating materials design, computations, and advanced analysis is
needed. For example, coupling advanced modeling with machine
learning can establish robust quantitative structure-activity models
spanning molecular to mesoscale effects. Going forward, priorities
include elucidating defect/doping effects, quantifying contributions
from interfacial/ensemble sites, and disentangling mass/charge trans-
port factors. Beyond base metals, rare earth or main group elements may
provide new avenues. On the applied side, operational assessments
under varied conditions and with integrated reactors/systems are
imperative. This includes quantifying stability over extended cycling
and under varied inlet gas/fluid compositions. By combining cutting-
edge modeling, synthesis strategies, and in-depth characterization, the
field is well-positioned to surmount existing barriers through rigorous,
collaborative scientific endeavor.

Looking ahead in the intermediate timescale over the next 10 years,
goals should aim to demonstrate multi-kilogram per day production in
pilot-scale facilities. This will validate technical and economic viability
for various engineering scale-up strategies, including modular panel
reactor arrays or continuous-flow packed-bed systems. Ultimately,
realizing the transformative potential of this field necessitates the
development of robust, compositionally-stable MOF electrocatalysts
with a 10-year lifetime capable of ton-per-day CO2 capture and con-
version in fully-integrated industrial facilities. Achieving this ambitious
long-term vision demands unprecedented advances across interdisci-
plinary domains and represents an ongoing grand challenge for the
global research community.
