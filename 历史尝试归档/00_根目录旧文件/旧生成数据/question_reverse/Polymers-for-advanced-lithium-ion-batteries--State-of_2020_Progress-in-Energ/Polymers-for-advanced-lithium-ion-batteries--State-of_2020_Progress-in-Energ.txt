Contents 

Polymers have been successfully used as electrode compounds and separator/electrolyte materials for 
lithium ion batteries (LiBs) due to their inherent outstanding properties such as low-density, easy of pro- 
cessing, excellent thermal, mechanical and electrical properties and easily tailored functional performance 
matching the ﬁnal device requirements. Battery performance strongly depends on the polymer type used. 
The physico-chemical properties of the polymers that are being used as different battery components 
need to be further improved to boost the development of the next generation of batteries for the elec- 
tric vehicle industry, where increased energy density and safety are required. Considering its role in LIBs, 
this review summarizes the latest advances in the ﬁeld of polymers applied as electrode compounds and 
separator/electrolytes. For each battery component, the state-of-art is divided by polymer type. Current 
bottlenecks and challenges that face polymers in LIBs are shown, and possible strategies to face them are 
provided.

sented in Fig. 3 . Special emphasis is placed in the role, function 
and properties of the different polymeric materials. Due to the crit- 
ical role of polymers in the separator/electrolyte when compared 
to polymer binders for electrodes, stronger research effort s have 
been carried out in aspect related to the separator/electrolyte, as it 
is shown in this review. 

2. Polymers for electrodes: polymer binder 

2.1. Function of the polymer binder and main desired characteristics 

Fig. 4 shows the typical structure of the electrode showing the 
main function of the polymer binder which acts as a cohesion ele- 
ment between the active material, the conductive additive and the 
current collector. 

Thus,  the  polymer  binder  affects  the  bonding  between  active 
material and conductive additive, processing parameters, morphol- 
ogy within electrode, and electrical and mechanical properties of 
the electrode, as well as the electrochemical performance as it is 
illustrated in Fig. 5 [13] . An absence or deterioration of the binder 
results  in  decreased  electronic  conductivity  and  electrochemical 
properties of the electrode due to a non-eﬃcient physical contact 
between the particles of the electrode [10] . 

Properties  such  as  molecular  type  of  polymer  and  molecular 
weight, mechanical properties and the used solvent [14] affect the 
resulting rheological properties of the electrode material and con- 
sequently, their electrochemical properties [15] . Similarly, the poly- 
mer binder affects the rheological behavior of the slurries, deter- 
mining the binder preparation method, slurry stability and hence 
the  battery  performance  [16] .  In  fact,  the  microstructure  of  the 
slurry, i.e., dispersion of the particles, can be estimated by the rhe- 
ological measurements [17] . 

The polymer distribution on ﬁller particles depends on the sur- 
face  area  and  surface  chemistry,  different  types  of  polymers  or 
even different batches of similar materials leading to different sur- 
face chemistry properties, being therefore critical the electrode op- 
timization for each polymer in order to obtain an optimum perfor- 
mance [18] . For example, an unsuitable binder distribution would 
reduce the adhesion strength to the current collector, increase sur- 
face resistance of the electrode plates and reduce the overall elec- 
trochemical properties [19] . Accordingly, the role of the polymer 
binder can be described at the macroscopic and microscopic lev- 
els, as represented in Fig. 6 . 

The  macroscopic  level  is  associated  with  the  electrochemical 
performance, i.e., electronic / ionic conductivity and cycling per- 
formance (cycle life and rate performance). On the contrary, the 
microscopic level is associated with the following issues: 

a) cohesion  between  active  material  and  conductive  additive  –

binding bridges; 

b) distribution of binder on the active material surface; 
c) interaction of binder with active material (nature of chemical 

bonding: hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces); 

d) contribution  of  the  binder  to  the  formation  of  a  stable  solid 
electrolyte interface (SEI) layer (mainly onto anode electrodes); 
e) interaction/absorption (electrolyte wettability) of the electrolyte 
by the binder allowing a facile Li transport to the active mate- 
rial ´s surface. 

2.2. Polymer binder types 

Different  polymer  binder  types  are  used  in  electrode  mate- 
rials  from  ﬂuorinated  polymers  such  as  poly(vinylidene  ﬂuoride) 
(PVDF) or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) biopolymers. Therefore,

1. Introduction 

There is an increasing and needed trend towards a reduction of 
the consumption of fossil fuels mainly due to environmental im- 
pact as well as an increasing need of highly eﬃcient energy stor- 
age systems as energy heads the list of top global problems for the 
next 50 years [1] . In fact, the use of eﬃcient energy storage de- 
vices for portable electronics and electric vehicles is continuously 
growing and for the near future, novel materials and devices with 
improved energy density and safety will be needed. In this frame- 
work,  Fig.  1  presents  the  Ragone  plot  (Energy  density  vs  Power 
density) for the different energy storage systems [ 2 , 3 ]. 

Currently, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) represent one of the most 
prominent  energy  storage  systems  when  compared  to  other  en- 
ergy storage systems ( Fig. 1 ), with a compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR)  of  17.0%  and  an  expected  global  value  of  US  $  93.1  bil- 
lion by 2025 [4] . When compared to other battery technologies, 
LIBs are lighter, cheaper, show higher energy density with lower 
lost load (self-discharge), no memory effect, prolonged service life 
and larger number of charge / discharge cycles [ 5 , 6 ]. As a matter 
of fact, speciﬁc energy, power, safety and reliability are key issues 
for improving the performance of lithium-ion batteries, which are 
typically composed of two electrodes (anode and cathode, negative 
and positive electrodes, respectively) and a separator / electrolyte 
as shown in Fig. 2 [ 7 , 8 ]. 

Both  electrodes  are  typically  composed  of  a  polymer  binder, 
a  conductive  additive  and  an  active  material  as  represented  in 
Fig.  2  [9] .  Each  component  of  the  electrode  has  a  speciﬁc  func- 
tion, where the polymer binder holds together the other compo- 
nents (active material and conductive additive) at the same time 
that improves the mechanical stability and ﬂexibility of the elec- 
trode [ 10 , 11 ]. The separator / electrolyte, as the other component 
of the battery, have the function of electrically separating the an- 
ode  and  the  cathode  while  ensuring  lithium  ion  mobility  [12] . 
Polymeric  materials  are  particularly  relevant  in  LIBs  since  they 
are used within the electrodes as binders and also in the separa- 
tor/electrolytes. Overall, polymers can be used in all of the compo- 
nents thanks to their unique properties such as mechanical ﬂexi- 
bility, chemical resistance, excellent processability and lightweight. 
Accordingly, Fig. 3 shows the different polymer types used for both 
components of LIBs [12] . 

This  review  analyzes  the  wide  variety  of  polymer  materials 
used in lithium ion batteries, considering the different types pre-

the state of the art on polymer binders for the electrodes is or- 
ganized into three sections dedicated to synthetic polymers, natu- 
ral/biopolymers and conductive polymers, respectively. 

2.2.1. Synthetic polymers 

Polymer binders are an essential component of electrodes, af- 
fecting  cycling  performance  of  lithium-ion  batteries.  Some  char- 
acteristics such as high adhesion, suitable mechanical properties, 
high electrolyte absorption, high thermal stability and chemical re- 
sistance need to be fulﬁlled by the polymer binders [9] . In that 
sense, Table 1 shows the most common polymer used as binder for 
electrodes. Although there are several synthetic polymer binders 
optimized for different active materials, taking into account their 
size and surface area, among others, PVDF emerges as the most 

widely used polymer for various active materials, independently of 
being the anode or the cathode due to its electrochemical stability 
from 0 to 5 V, high adhesion to the current collector and excellent 
mechanical properties [20] . 

Although neat PVDF is widely used to develop LIBs, its prop- 
erties  can  be  further  upgraded  by  grafting  it  with  maleic  anhy- 
dride [84] , grafting of poly(tert -butylacrylate) (PtBA) for increas- 
ing  its  mechanical  properties  [73] ,  or  addition  of  rosin  biopoly- 
mer to decrease its crystallinity [ 85 , 86 ] in order to improve over- 
all  electrode  properties.  Also,  PVDF  with  lithium  manganese  ox- 
ide  (LiMn 
4 )  active  material  leads  to  reduced  Mn  dissolution 
and  consequently  improves  rate  capability  [87] .  Similarly,  PVDF

PMALi) composites [90] , polyethylene oxide (PEO) composites [91] , 
polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PE-PEG) co-polymer and 
poly(propylene  carbonates)  (PPCs)  [92]  and  epoxy  resin  (ionized 
oligomer) [93] were developed to improve rate capability and over- 
all properties of the electrode. 

A  new  poly  (styrene-butene/ethylene-styrene) polymer  binder 
(SEBS) has been recently proposed for both electrodes (anode and 
cathode) in printed batteries, in order to provide better mechan- 
ical  stability  and  a  more  effective  electronic  conductive  network 
[82] . 

A work dealing with the effect of different binders for lithium 
iron  phosphate  (LiFePO 
4 )  cathode  active  material  demonstrated 
that  poly(vinylideneﬂuoride-co-hexaﬂuoropropylene)  (PVDF-HFP) 
presents remarkable advantages due to the decrease of the charge- 
transfer resistance and the increase electronic conductivity in com- 
parison of PVDF and PMMA polymers [94] . In order to further im- 
prove  the  properties  of  PVDF-HFP,  lithium  sulfonate-grafts  were 
synthesized through covalent attachment of taurine, leading to a 
better cycling performance [76] . Typically, these common polymers

are  prepared  with  N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone  (NMP)  solvent  within 
the slurry for casting the cathode and anode of lithium-ion bat- 
teries. This solvent needs to be replaced by a green and environ- 
mentally friendlier solvents in order to decrease the environmen- 
tal  impacts  associated  with  the  fabrication  of  batteries  for  elec- 
tric vehicles [95] . A suitable strategy to avoid solvent use in the 
electrode slurry is to use a photocurable binder such as isosorbide 
dimethacrylate (ISDM) [96] . An essential property in the polymer

binder  is  the  ﬂexibility  and,  considering  this  fact,  a  new  binder 
based on polymethacrylic acid (PMAA) containing triethylene gly- 
col monomethyl ether (TEG) was proposed for lithium-ion batteries 
with high ﬂexibility [97] . 

Optimized processing conditions are critical for adequate binder 
performance. Thus, surface and interfacial cutting analysis system 
(SAICAS) was used to evaluate the PVDF binder distribution on the 
cathode and it was veriﬁed that upon high drying temperatures of 
about 230 ºC lead to electrodes with uniform adhesion properties 
and higher interfacial adhesion strength [64] . 

Poly(acrylic  acid)  (PAA)  is  a  widely  used  polymer  binder  due 
to the high concentration of carbonyl groups and good mechan- 
ical elasticity, which improves the bonding properties of the ac- 
tive material. Different particle surfaces such  as prepolymerizing 
dopamine [28] , grafting of 1-(bromoethyl)benzene initiator groups 
[27] , rosin embedded [98] , grafting with polyvinyl alcohol [ 99 , 100 ], 
composites with poly(butyl acrylate)-based (PBA) [101] , cyanoethyl 
polymer (PVA-CN) [102] , composites with CMC [103] and adding a 
photoreactive benzophenone group [104] have been used to im- 
prove  its  properties  and  it  has  been  found  that  the  adequate 
molecular weight ranges between 24 and 150 kDa [105] . 

Considering the marked thermal variations during the cycling 
performance of lithium-ion batteries, polyimide (PI) has been used 
as a binder due to its high thermal resistance. It has been found 
that  this  polymer  enhances  battery  performance  and  also  im- 
proves the adhesive/cohesive strength within the electrode com- 
posite  [50] .  Poly(acrylonitrile-butylacrylate)  (P(AN-BA))  has  been 
also used for graphite electrodes [37] .

Lithium  polyacrylate  (Li-PAA)  was  used  as  a  binder  for 
Sn 
40 and its electrochemical performance was compared in 
30 Co 
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and PVDF binders, exhibit- 
ing an excellent capacity retention capacity [21] . 

For Si anodes, a polymer binder based on cross-linking of PVA 
and  poly(ethylene  imine)  (PEI)  precursor  was  developed,  show- 
ing  strong  adhesion  to  silicon  particles  and  improved  electro- 
chemical performance [106] . Similarly, a polymer binder based on 
vinyltriethoxysilane crosslinked poly(acrylic acid sodium) (PVTES- 

NaPAA) has shown to improve Si electrode stability, which results 
in  excellent  cycling  performance  and  high  coulombic  eﬃciency

by  pyrolysis  of  linear  low-density  polyethylene  [109]  have  been 
also proposed as binders as they promote increased performance 
for this anode. 

Some traditional binders are based on reactive polymers which 
allow different chemical modiﬁcations through the addition of di- 
verse functional groups. This fact opens the possibility to improve 
speciﬁc properties, such as binding properties to the solid material, 
mechanical  properties,  and  adhesion  to  current  collector,  among 
others. 

The  effect  of  the  surface  modiﬁcation  of  graphite  particles 
by  poly(acrylic  acid)  (PAA),  poly(methacrylic  acid)  (PMA)  and 
poly(vinyl  alcohol)  (PVA)  polymer  binders  was  analysed.  These 
binders  have  functional  groups  containing  oxygen  atoms  and  it 
was demonstrated that the surface modiﬁcation affects the elec- 
trochemical lithium alloying and conversion reactions, improving 
battery properties with respect to PVDF as a binder [57] . 

The role of functional groups attached to the polymer binder 
2 was investigated using molec- 
on the structural stability of Li x SiO 
ular dynamics simulations. It was observed that polar groups work 
more effectively to suppress the volume expansion of Li x SiO 
2 from 
lithiation [41] . 

The stability of the different polymer binders in the presence 
of lithium peroxide was studied, in which the presence of electron 
withdrawing groups (-CN, -Cl, -F) adjacent to hydrogen atoms re- 
sults in an atom electron-deﬁcient hydrogen. As a consequence, it 
becomes more susceptible to lithium peroxide attack. 

Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 7 , poly(tetraﬂuoroethylene) (PTFE), 
Naﬁon,  poly(methyl  methacrylate)  (PMMA)  and  PEO  have  been 
found to be the most suitable polymers for Li 
2  active material 
[110] .

For  Li–S  batteries,  binders  based  on  polyimide-poly(ethylene 
oxide) [106] , hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) polymerized with 
polyethylenimine (PEI) have been developed as the amino groups

can effectively reduce the polysulﬁde dissolution [44] . For this bat- 
tery type also a binder based on sulfur-poly(acrylonitrile) was de- 
veloped,  as  the  interaction  between  the  electrochemically  active 
backbone, the covalently bound sulfur and the S 
8 that forms dur- 
ing recharging, allow to obtain both high capacity and good cycling 
stability [36] . Another binder for Li-S batteries has been developed 
through the use of a high ﬂuid ionic liquid carbon source for the 
carbon coating of nano-Li 

2 S under pyrolysis conditions [111] . 

The  π -stacked  perylene  bisimide  (PBI)  polymer  was  used  as 
a binder in Li–S batteries reducing the Li–S cell impedance with 
respect  to  PVDF  and  exhibiting  excellent  durability  [40]  [112] . 
Poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) binders containing lithium 
have been developed for lithium-ion batteries in which the func- 
tional group (-COOLi) acts as a SEI component, reducing the elec- 
trolyte decomposition and providing a stable passivating layer for 
the favorable penetration of lithium ions [49] . In order to enhance 
the rate cyclability of Li-S batteries, a new binder based on SiO 
2 - 
impregnated polymer blend of Li + -Naﬁon with PVP was developed 
to successfully regulate tetrasulﬁde movement [113] . 

A  highly  adhesive  poly(amic  acid)  (PAmA)  binder  containing 
carboxylic acid and pyrenyl chains was produced for Si-Ni-SiC elec- 
trodes for lithium-ion battery applications where the presence of 
the carboxylic acid and pyrenyl groups helps to strengthen the in- 
tegrity of the ﬁlm through pi-pi stacking interactions with the con- 
ductive  carbons  [35] ,  epoxy  binders  (for  Sn  electrode)  [114]  and 
epoxy resin with PEI polymer (for Li-S batteries) [115] . Finally a 
bis-imino-acenaphthenequinone (BIAN)–ﬂuorene copolymer binder 
was used for the fabrication of a graphite electrodes in lithium-ion 
batteries,  improving  signiﬁcantly  the  cycling  performance  of  the 
battery with respect to PVDF as a binder [116] . 

Considering the function of the polymer binder in the electrode, 
different synthetic binders have been used as shown in Table 1 . 
Most of the works include PVDF, PAA, PVA, or SBR, although new 
speciﬁc  binders,  such  as  PBI,  PAmA,  or  SEBS,  are  being  investi- 
gated. The main advantage of these polymers is their large-scale 
production  ability  and  the  possibility  of  easy  tuning  their  func- 
tional groups, which gives room to further improve their proper- 
ties for the speciﬁc role as polymer binder. Unfortunately, the main 
disadvantage of synthetic binders is to use of toxic solvents. PVDF 
stands out as polymer binder in comparison to the other binders 
due to its chemical properties, stability and the improvements real- 
ized within the different research works. In any case, the develop- 
ment of a multifunctional binder with upgraded thermal, mechan- 
ical and electrochemical properties and good binding properties to 
the solid phase becomes of paramount relevance towards the fab- 
rication of LIBs with improved performance. 

2.2.2. Natural polymers and biopolymers 

Considering the environmental issues associated with the use of 
traditional binders derived from fossil fuels, natural polymers and 
biopolymers are beginning to be widely used as binders for battery 
electrodes. 

Table 2 shows the most commonly found natural polymer and 
biopolymers used as polymer binders for LIBs. The attempt to re- 
place PVDF as a the most used conventional binder is being based 
on natural and biopolymers as such carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) 
[117] , gelatine [118] , glycol chitosan [119] , lignin [120] , guar gum 
[121] ,  and  water-dispersible  sulfopolyester  [122] ,  among  others. 
This would allow the fabrication of environmentally friendlier elec- 
trodes with polymer binders produced through biomass or by mi- 
crobial production and living organisms [123] . For these polymer 
binders, the study of their rheological properties is very important 
as it affects the network structure of the different electrode com- 
ponents,  the  development  of  a  homogeneous  electrode  ﬁlm  be- 
coming of paramount relevance [ 124 , 125 ].

Carboxymethyl  cellulose  (CMC)  is  the  most  widely  used 
biopolymer for LIB electrodes. Several works have been devoted for 
the improvement of its properties, such as crosslinkers with acid 
citric to improve the electrode stability [126] , crosslinked with PAA 
polymer [ 127 , 128 ], composites with SBR binder [129] , doped with 
lithium ions [130] and crosslinking with sodium borate [131] . Cel- 
lulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with peroxotitanate have been used to 
obtain freestanding mesoporous ﬁlms of TiO 
2  and chiral nematic 
TiC structures [132] , as well as on the fabrication of mesoporous 
black titanium dioxide (TiO 
2 −x ) with a chiral nematic organization 
[133] for application as lithium-ion battery anodes. 

A base on gelatin-polyethylenimine composite (gelatin-PEI) was 
developed for Li-S batteries, in which the dispersion and adhesion 
ability of gelatin keeps the cathode homogeneous and stable dur- 
ing the electrochemical reaction, and the adsorption capability of 
PEI for polysulﬁde suppresses the “shuttling effect” [134] . 

A multigrafting block copolymer based on glycol chitosan (GC) 
and lithium polyacrylate (LiPAA) was developed as binder for sil- 
icon  electrodes.  It  was  demonstrated  that  this  binder  improves 
the  initial  discharge  capacity,  long-term  retaining  capacity,  and 
coulombic eﬃciency [119] . Seven different hydrocolloids (sodium 
carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC), sodium alginate (Na-Alg), gum 
arabic (GA), xanthan gum (XG), guar gum (GG), agar-agar (AA) and 
carrageenan (CAR)) were tested as water-soluble binders for syn- 
thetic graphite (SG)- based electrodes for LIBs and compared with 
the standard PVDF binder in which SG/GA, SG/CAR and SG/AA elec- 
trodes  show  poorer  electrochemical  performances  in  comparison 
with other binders [184] . However, to improve the properties of 
sodium alginate (SA), a crosslinker with Cu 2 + ions was added for 
Li-S  batteries  and  it  was  demonstrated  that  these  modiﬁcations 
immobilize  polysulﬁde  anions  and  consequently  improve  battery 
performance  [191] .  Poly- γ -glutamate,  a  slimy  constituent  in  the 
Japanese  food  Natto,  consisting  of  fermented  soybeans  has  also 
been studied as binder for silicon and graphite electrodes [192] . 
As depicted in Fig. 8 , a low-cost and widely available biopolymer 
such as lignin has been mixed with silicon nanoparticles to use it 
as a binder with exceptional electrochemical performance [120] . 

A polymer binder based on polyacrylamide (PAAm) was devel- 
oped through the dual-crosslinking with grafted alginate, where an 
improved lithium ion kinetics in the Si/C electrode with good re- 
versibility of lithium ions insertion/desertion was observed [169] . 
A systematic analysis of different polysaccharide binders was per- 
formed  for  the  Si  electrode  and  it  was  found  that  the  superior 
performance of native-xanthan gum (XG) originates from its ion- 
dipole interactions that are properly positioned on the side chains 
within the superstructure of native-XG [193] . This natural polysac- 
charide also acts as a microporous binder to obtain improved elec- 
trochemical properties [194] . A binder consisting on a natural rub- 
ber / chitosan blend was developed to improve the properties of 
each individual constituent to provide a proper elastic performance

which accommodates the large volume Si expansion during cycling 
[195] . 

These novel binders derived from renewable resources such as 
polysaccharides  and  proteins  emerge  as  key  materials  for  elec- 
trodes in the near future, although their mechanical, electrochemi- 
cal and binding properties need to be further improved. The im- 
provement  of  these  properties  is  essential  to  replace  traditional 
binders by these renewable binders which apart from being en- 
vironmentally friendlier and cheap, can be processes without the 
use of toxic solvents. 

2.2.3. Conductive polymers 

The  use  of  conductive  polymers  on  electrodes  for  LIBs  has 
the  advantage  of  replacing  the  conductive  additive  at  the 
same  time  that  acts  as  polymer  binder,  supporting  the  re- 
duction  of  the  amount  of  non-active  material  used  for  the 
electrode.  Different  conductive  polymers  are  used,  including 
polyaniline  (PANI)  [196] ,  polypyrrole  (PPy)  [197] ,  poly(3,4- 
ethylenedioxythiophene)  (PEDOT)  [198] ,  sodium  poly-(9,9-bis(3- 
propanoate)  ﬂuorene)  (PF-COONa)  [199] ,  poly(3-hexylthiophene) 
[200] ,  poly  (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene  sulfonate 
(PEDOT:PSS)  [201] ,  poly(2,7–9,9-dioctylﬂuorene)  (PFO)  [202] , 
poly[3-(lithium  acetate)  thiophene-2,5-diyl]  (PT-3-LiA)  [203] , 
poly[3-(lithium-4-butanoate)  thiophene-2,5-diyl]  (PT-3-LiB)  [203] , 
Poly(1-pyrenemethyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PPyMAA) 
[204] and poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid) 
(ProDOT)  [205] .  PFPQ-COONa  was  tested  as  conductive  binder 
for  Si  anode  and  presents  an  excellent  cycling  stability  and 
satisfactory  rate  performance  with  relatively  high  area  loading, 
which outperforms currently reported single component conduc- 
tive  binders  [199] .  Also  for  this  anode,  polymer  binders  based 
on  graphite/polyaniline  [206]  and  polyaniline  nanocomposites 
[207] were developed ( Table 3 ). 

An  electrode  consisting  of  two-component  slurries  of  PE- 
DOT:PSS binder and LiFePO 
4 active material in the absence of con- 
ductive carbon additives was fabricated. A better adhesion, higher 
electrical conductivity and improved electrochemical performance 
of  the  resulting  positive  electrodes  was  observed  when  using  a 
solid loading of 40% [201] . This conductive polymer was latter used 
in silicon anodes produced by inkjet-printing as shown Fig. 9 [211] . 
A novel binder based on the mixture of PAA and PEDOT:PSS was 
developed to signiﬁcantly improve the speciﬁc capacity and cycling 

stability of Li-S batteries. While PEDOT:PSS facilitates the electron 
transfer and prevents the polysulﬁde dissolution, PAA improves the 
solvent system for sulfur cathodes and promotes the lithium-ion 
transfer [214] . Also composite materials consisting on PEDOT:PSS 
with  CMC  and  PEDOT:PSS  with  PEO  and  PEI  [215]  were  devel- 
oped for Si anodes [216] , while composites of PEDOT:PSS with car- 
boxymethyl chitosan were proposed for LiFePO 
4  cathode [217] of 
lithium-ion batteries. 

Conductive polymers have been used as a binder in order to 
improve the electrical conductivity of the electrodes through their 
backbone or side chains. Diverse works demonstrate the applicabil- 
ity of these binders to improve battery performance, but their use 
is limited taking into account their mechanical and electrochem- 
ical properties. Importantly, the binding and adhesion properties 
to current collectors are issues that need to be faced in order to 
spread the use of conductive polymers in LIBs. 

Overall, PVDF, cellulose and PEDOT:PSS are the most commonly 
used polymer binders in the areas of traditional, natural and con- 
ductive binders, respectively. Independently of the polymer binder 
used, its function results essential in the development of suitable 
electrodes towards high battery performance. The development of 
a universal binder based on natural polymers that can be used in 
small amounts and possess excellent properties such as high ad- 
hesion to current collector would be needed in the coming years. 
Moreover,  such  binder  must  also  present  a  combination  of  high 
thermal, mechanical and electrical properties with a wide electro- 
chemical window up to 6.0 V that can disable the SEI formation 
and improve Li + transference. 

3. Polymers for battery separators and solid electrolytes 

Conventional rechargeable LIBs are typically composed by solid 
electrodes and a liquid solution which impregnates a solid mem- 
brane known as separator [218] . In LIBs, electrolytes  are lithium 
salts dissolved in a mixture of one or more solvents and are re- 
sponsible for the Li +  ion diffusion between both electrodes. The 
separator  acts  as  an  interlayer  to  physically  isolate  the  positive 
and negative electrodes to prevent electrical contact between an- 
ode and cathode at the same time that allows an eﬃcient ionic 
diffusion between electrodes. Consequently, separators should be 
electronic insulators and must display high ionic conductivity ei- 
ther by intrinsic ionic conduction or by soaking an electrolyte. Sep-

arators should ideally be highly resistant to the electrochemical in- 
teraction from electrodes and electrolyte and protect against short 
circuit, thermal runaway and overcharge [219] . 

Although classiﬁed as an inactive cell component, the separa- 
tor is a critical component in LIBs as its properties affect the cell 
performance  (energy-density,  power-density),  cycle-life  and  most 
importantly, its safety, especially considering the burnings and ex- 
plosions of consumer electronics powered by LIBs that happened, 
for example, in 2016 [ 218 , 220 ]. Different factors need to be taken 
into account when selecting a separator for speciﬁc LIB applica- 
tions. These factors have been classiﬁed into structural properties, 
physical/chemical properties, functional properties (which are de- 
termined by the structure and physico-chemical character) and ad- 
ditional desirable properties, as represented in Fig. 10 . 

Structural properties: 

(cid:2) Thickness: Current desirable thicknesses are around 20–25 μm 
[221] .  The  thicker  the  membrane,  the  better  stability  against 
puncture, which also implies a higher Li + diffusion resistance. 
High performance cells use 16 μm thick separators to obtain 
high volumetric energy density. Separators should be uniform 
to support many charging cycles and provide homogeneous Li + 
transfer which delays dendrite formation. 

(cid:2) Porosity: pores should be small enough to avoid dendrite pene- 
tration through the separator ( < 1 μm) but large enough to al- 
low Li + ion diffusion (several nanometers). A non-uniform pore 
size  results  in  non-uniform  current  densities,  which  in  turn 
yield low-performance and faster dendrite growth. Porosity val- 
ues in the range of 40–60% are usually required to allow eﬃ- 

cient and fast ion diffusion. An excessive porosity may hinder 
the ability of the separator to shut-down [222] . 

(cid:2) Tortuosity: it describes the average pore conductivity of the sep- 
arator and should present an intermediate value to allow low 
resistance to ion diffusion but high enough to avoid dendrite 
growth. 

(cid:2) Structural stability: the structure should be kept after electrolyte 

soaking (shrinkage, wrinkle, swell). 

Physical/chemical properties: 

(cid:2) Electrolyte wettability / absorption: s eparators should be rapidly 
swollen when soaked with electrolyte and they should retain 
the absorbed electrolyte under operating conditions [223] . 
(cid:2) Mechanical properties: soft separators are not stable against den- 
drite  growth;  a  high  puncture  stress  is  required  to  avoid  in- 
ternal short-circuit by dendrite growth and penetration. On the 
contrary, too rigid separators may complicate the assembly pro- 
cess (especially in ﬂexible batteries). 

(cid:2) Thermal stability:  the separator should be stable against ther- 
mal  shrinkage  ( <  5%  after  60  min  at  90  °C)  [10] .  It  must 
also  keep  its  integrity  after  shutdown  to  avoid  direct  con- 
tact  between  electrodes.  Separators  with  stable  mechani- 
cal  properties  at  high  temperatures  provide  a  larger  safety 
margin. 

(cid:2) Chemical stability: Inert to strong reducing and oxidizing condi- 
tions (on the negative and positive electrode sides respectively) 
under long-term cycling at high temperatures. They should be 
able to withstand electrolyte degradation, electrode reactants or 
impurities [223] .

Fig. 10.  General requirements for LIB separators. 

Functional properties: 

(cid:2) Ionic conductivity: it should be high to allow an eﬃcient Li + dif- 
fusion. The ionic resistivity of an electrolyte wetting a separator 
is much higher than the resistivity of the free electrolyte. Mac- 
Mullin number accounts for the change in separator/electrolyte 
ionic resistivity in comparison with that of the electrolyte, and 
needs to be kept under a value of 8 [222] . 

(cid:2) Electrical resistivity: the separator should be electrically insula- 
tor to maintain electrical isolation between the cathode and an- 
ode and avoid short-circuit between electrodes. In practice, the 
electrical resistivity of commercial separators is 10 12 –10 14 (cid:6)• m. 
(cid:2) Air permeability: high permeability values ensure a good sepa- 
rator performance. It can be quantiﬁed by the Gurley number 
as it accounts for the time that a speciﬁc amount of air needs 
to pass across a speciﬁc area of separator under a speciﬁc pres- 
sure. The Gurley number is inversely proportional to the ionic 
resistance of a given separator morphology [222] . 

(cid:2) Puncture  stress:  It  accounts  for  the  maximum  load  that  must 
be applied to a needle to puncture a given separator. A high 
puncture  strength  ( >  300  g  for  25  μm  separators)  ensures 
that both electrodes are kept electrically isolated during cell- 
assembly (either spiral winding or stacked-plate process) and 
protects against dendritic penetration [224] . 

(cid:2) Auto-shutdown  ability:  Auto-shutdown  is  an  essential  mecha- 
nism  for  preventing  thermal  runaway.  The  protection  against 
short-circuit is induced by the controlled collapse of the ion- 
ically  conducting  porous  membrane  due  to  the  partial  melt- 
ing of the separator to yield an ionically insulating non-porous 
protecting layer between both electrodes (a 10 0 0-fold increase 
in impedance is required) [20] . As a consequence, the electro- 
chemical  activity  in  the  cell  is  stopped,  shutting  the  battery 
down. 

Additional  desirable  properties  that  need  to  be  taken  into 
account  when  designing  separators  for  LIBs  are  safety,  cost- 
effectiveness  and  sustainability.  Together  with  the  above- 
mentioned  dendrite  growth  resistance  and  dimensional  stability 
at  high  temperatures,  separators  should  present  ﬂame-retarding 
properties to avoid explosion events. Thermally-conductive mem- 
branes  may  help  to  reduce  the  temperature  increase  under 
operation  conditions  as  they  facilitate  heat  dissipation,  reducing 

explosion  risks.  As  the  cost  of  the  separators  can  reach  20%  of 
the total cost of a high-power LIB, designing novel materials and 
technologies  for  separators  becomes  of  key  relevance  towards 
industrial  applications.  Separators  based  on  renewable  polymers 
such  as  biomass-based  cellulose  and  its  derivatives  emerge  as 
novel alternatives for traditional fossil-based polymer  separators. 
Separators of high wettability, nanoporous structure, dimensional 
stability  at  temperatures  up  to  180  °C  and  the  often  disjoint 
mechanical ﬂexibility and robustness can be obtained [225–227] . 
Accordingly,  the  fabrication  of  porous  separator  membranes  via 
facile  papermaking  processes  could  pave  the  way  towards  the 
development of future cost-effective and sustainable separators. 

Depending on the application area, the relevance of these crite- 
ria may change, although in most of the cases a compromise be- 
tween all these characteristics (which often are mutually exclusive) 
must be taken. For instance, a thin separator may allow an eas- 
ier Li + transport between electrodes, which would increase battery 
power and capacity on the one side but could lead to poor stability 
against dendrite growth and eventual failure via short-circuit from 
the other. Taking into account, that LIBs are ﬁnding many novel ap- 
plications, there is an increasing demand to upgrade battery safety 
without limiting their cost and performance, which results in a re- 
newed interest in separators from both industry and academia. As 
a result, the market for separators is expected to exceed $ 3 billion 
by 2020 [228] . 

One  of  the  main  differences  between  the  separator  and  the 
polymeric electrolyte is that, contrarily to the separator, which is 
a solid porous membrane, the polymeric electrolyte is deﬁned as a 
polymeric matrix containing lithium salts, ionic liquids or other in- 
organic materials yielding a composite, together with non-aqueous 
solvents (dimethyl carbonate, DMC; diethyl carbonate, DEC; propy- 
lene carbonate, PC or ethylene carbonate, EC) [229] . Polymer elec- 
trolytes can be divided into solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and gel 
polymer electrolyte (GPE). Table 4 shows the most used polymer 
types for battery separators and polymer electrolytes, highlighting 
their main properties for these applications.

sive charge/discharge cycles can yield to electrolyte leakages, re- 
sulting in serious malfunction. Liquid electrolytes used in commer- 
cial LIBs present ionic conductivities in the order of 10 −3 S cm −1 
and  are  nonaqueous  electrolytes  because  of  the  reactivity  of 
lithium to water. These organic solvent-based electrolytes should 
ensure  a  rapid  Li +  diffusion  across  both  the  electrolyte  and  the 
electrode/electrolyte interface, should not react/degrade under nor- 
mal  operating  conditions,  should  provide  a  stable  electrolyte- 
electrode  interface  during  cycling  [251] .  and  are  composed  by 
6 )  dissolved  in  linear  carbonates  such  as 
Li  salts  (typically  LiPF 
dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC) or ethyl methyl 
carbonate (EMC) [252] . 

A  main  strategy  to  develop  novel  safer,  lighter  and  non- 
ﬂammable electrolyte systems and to provide LIBs with improved 
resistance against dendrite formation is the introduction of a me- 
chanically  resistant  solid  electrolyte  sandwiched  between  both 
electrodes, the so-called solid polymer electrolyte. Solid polymer 
electrolytes  are  ionically  conducting  materials  and  have  the  pe- 
culiarity of functioning as both electrolyte and separator. The re- 
placement of conventional liquid electrolytes by solid electrolytes 
also opens the path towards ﬂexible LIBs capable of withstanding 
large mechanical deformations with no leakage and short-circuit 
[253] . Although liquid electrolytes have been the preferred choice 
so far for the development of high-performance LIBs because of the 
lower  ionic  conductivity  of  solid  electrolytes  [254] ,  current  con- 
cerns on battery safety are boosting the development of solid elec- 
trolytes, which can be classiﬁed as: 

• Solid  polymer  electrolytes  (SPEs):  SPEs  are  composed  by 
lithium  salts  dissolvent  in  polymeric  matrices  such  as  PEO, 

PMMA,  PVDF,  PVDF-HFP  or  PAN.  Their  mechanically  ﬂexible 
character  enables  a  plethora  of  designs  for  batteries  at  the 
same time that alleviates drawbacks associated with the vol- 
ume changes of electrodes as a consequence of cycling. SPEs are 
cheap, easy to produce, show low densities of nearly 1.2 g cm −3 
and are compatible with cathode and anode [255] . 

• Gel  polymer  electrolytes  (GPEs):  they  are  obtained  through 
the trapping of Li +  containing solutions such as lithium hex- 
aﬂuorophosphate  (LiPF 
6 )  in  carbonate  solvent  within  a  poly- 
meric gel-type membrane based on PEO, PMMA, PVDF, PVC…
They combine the advantages of liquid and solid polymer elec- 
trolytes, i.e., high ionic conductivity provided by the diffusive 
properties of liquids together with the proper mechanical sta- 
bility arising from the cohesive properties of solids. GPEs would 
not  be  discussed  here  as  they  cannot  be  considered  as  “all- 
solid” electrolytes. For detailed information readers are directed 
to the recent review works [ 256 , 257 ]. 

• Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs): they are composed by 
SPEs or GPEs reinforced with nanoparticles to improve the ionic 
conductivity, thermal stability and mechanical strength of the 
hosting matrix. These particles could be either micrometer or 
nanometer in size and ceramic, metallic oxide or bio-based. 

3.1.1. Separator types 

Polymeric  separators  for  LIBs  are  composed  by  microporous 
ﬁlms, nonwoven fabrics or electrospun membranes. Celgard® sep- 
arator  is  an  example  of  microporous  polymeric  ( Fig.  11 a  and 
11 b)  ﬁlms  which  can  be  manufactured  through  “wet” or  “dry”
processes.  Wet  fabrication  involves  the  extrusion  of  a  plasti-

cizer/polymer mixture at elevated temperatures followed by phase 
separation,  biaxial  stretching,  and  extraction  of  the  pore  former 
with  a  volatile  solvent  (elliptical  pores  with  an  overall  porosity 
of 40–50% is obtained). Dry fabrication, on the contrary, is based 
on the extrusion of a thin polymer sheet which is subjected to a 
rapid drawdown where after a thermal treatment below melting 
temperature,  crystalline  regions  are  obtained.  Then,  the  sheet  is 
rapidly stretched to achieve slit-like pores with an overall poros- 
ity of 35–45%. Nonwoven separators are membranes manufactured 
directly  from  ﬁbres  which  can  be  directionally  or  randomly  ar- 
ranged. Despite to their easier fabrication with respect to micro- 
porous membranes, their application has been limited as it is dif- 
ﬁcult to obtain thin, uniform and mechanically stable ﬁlms, which 
is a prerequisite for LIB separators. Separator membranes obtained 
by phase separation ( Fig. 11 c) or electrospinning ( Fig. 11 d) emerge 
as  attractive  candidates  for  high  performance  batteries  as  these 
techniques  provide  materials  with  porosities  up  to  90%  with  in- 
terconnected  structure,  which  when  used  in  LIBs  result  in  im- 
proved  ionic  conductivities  [258] .  Although  it  was  ﬁrst  invented 
in  1934,  the  fabrication  of  one-dimensional  nanoﬁbers  through 
electrospinning  for  separators  has  witness  an  increasing  interest 
during the last years [258] . In spite of the desirable structure of 
nonwoven and electrospun separators, their fabrication process is 
somewhat slow, and their mechanical properties are still relatively 
weak,  making  their  large-scale  commercialization  a  challenging 
task. 

One of the most pursued strategies to improve the performance 
of  separators  is  the  development  of  composite  materials  as  the 
addition of micrometer or nanometer sized ﬁllers into polymeric 
membranes  results  in  improved  mechanical  strength,  wettability 
with organic electrolyte, increased thermal stability and increased 
ionic conductivity of the separator by promoting the migration of 
lithium ions [259–261] . A reinforcing phase may also provide an 
improved resistance against pinhole formation and thus, prevent- 
ing the penetration of Li dendrites and extending the life-cycle of 

2 O 

3  (aluminum oxide) or TiO 

LIBs [262] . Incorporated ﬁllers can be either active or passive, i.e. 
they participate in the conduction process by modifying the ionic 
conductivity  and Li transference number or they do not directly 
take part in the conduction process [263] . SiO 
2  (silicon dioxide), 
Al 
2  (titanium dioxide) are the most 
representative inert ceramic oxides [260] . Their addition into poly- 
mer host matrices results in an increase of the ionic conductivity, 
which is associated to a concomitant decrease of the crystallinity 
of  the  hosting  matrix  and  Lewis  acid-base  type  interactions  be- 
tween inorganic nanoparticles and electrolyte solution [264] . Other 
ﬁllers include ferroelectric ceramics with high dielectric constant 
such  as  barium  titanate  (BaTiO 
3 )  which  increase  the  Li  transfer- 
ence number (and therefore the ionic conductivity) as a result of 
the ﬁller polarization [265] , layered clays such as montmorillonite 
(MMT) which improve electrolyte wettability and thermal stabil- 
ity  [266] ,  carbonaceous  ﬁllers  such  as  graphene,  graphene  oxide 
or  carbon  nanotubes  (their  concentration  should  be  below  per- 
colation threshold to avoid electrical contact between electrodes) 
which serve as mechanical reinforcement and thermal stabiltizers 
[260] , and zeolites such as NaY which possess strong Lewis acid 
centres [267] . 

Obtaining a homogeneous distribution of ﬁllers remains a chal- 
lenging issue. Other approaches such as polymer blending and sur- 
face  functionalization  have  also  been  pursued  so  far  to  upgrade 
the  functional  performance  of  separators,  which  include  the  use 
of a binder such as PVDF-HFP, although it usually brings undesired 
thickness increases and pore block up, decreasing the energy den- 
sity of the battery. To overcome these drawbacks, a thin layer of 
inorganic phase could be coated in a controlled fashion onto or- 
ganic supports by methods such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) 
[137] , magnetron sputtering deposition (MSD) [268] , or Direct Cur- 
rent (DC) sputtering [269] . With the goal of simplifying the list, 
in this section the most used LIB separators will be listed, which 
are  classiﬁed  according  to  the  hosting  matrix  regardless  of  they 
consisting on a single polymer, nonwoven membranes, electrospun

membranes, membranes with external surface modiﬁcation, com- 
posites membranes and polymer blends [229] . 

Polyoleﬁns: Based on their high mechanical strength, fair chem- 
ical and electrochemical stability and cost effectiveness, polyoleﬁns 
such  as  polyethylene  (PE)  and  polypropylene  (PP)  are  currently 
the  most  widely  used  materials  for  LIB  separators  [270] .  Com- 
mercial polyoleﬁn monolayer separators with a pore sizes in the 
0.03 −0.5  μm  range  and  a  porosity  of  30 −50%  have  been  used 
in  LIBs  so  far;  where  high  pore  volumes  and  large  pore  diame- 
ters support improving the ionic conductivity of polyoleﬁn sepa- 
rators after being soaked with the electrolyte, increasing capacities 
at high C-rates [271] . On the contrary, low porosity and small pore 
sized membranes are more eﬃcient in order to prevent internal 
shorts between electrodes [272] . As depicted in Fig. 11 a, monolayer 
separators have been proven eﬃcient for low-voltage LIBs, where 
PE separators are preferred as they show improved cyclic stability 
in comparison with PP separators due to their lower HOMO energy 
[273] . Microporous multilayer membranes composed by PP and PE, 
either as PE–PP bilayer or as PP–PE–PP trilayer, have been devel- 
oped by separator manufacturers as thermal shutdown strategy. In 
these trilayer systems ( Fig. 11 b) a temperature increase produces 
the partial melting of the PE layer, which collapses the pores and 
therefore  prevents  the  migration  of  the  Li +  between  electrodes. 
Most of the commercial separators use PE as a “shut-down” layer 
(at  ≈130  °C),  while  PP  layer  still  retains  the  dimensional  struc- 
ture  of  the  membrane  [270] .  Although  the  electrochemical  reac- 
tions within the cell are stopped and the cell shuts down to protect 
against external short circuit or accidental overcharge, the marked 
thermal  shrinkage  suffered  by  polyoleﬁns  may  result  in  internal 
short circuits when the temperature further increases [274] . 

One of the most representative examples of microporous com- 
mercial separators is Celgard R (cid:4) (Celgard LLC), which is a 25 μm 
thick trilayer microporous membrane (0.03 −0.1 μm pores) com- 
posed of PP–PE–PP. Other commercial manufacturers of LIB sep- 
arators  are  Asahi  Kasei,  which  commercialises  a  single-layer  PE 
membrane  with  a  0.05 −0.5  μm  pore  range  under  the  name  of 
HiPore TM ,  ENTEK  Manufacturing  LLC  which  provides  three  main 
membrane types for LIBS (EP, EPH and EPX lines), Mitsui Chem- 
icals Inc., that produces a ultra high molecular weight polyethy- 
lene membrane under the name of HI-ZEX MILLION TM or Ube In- 
dustries, Ltd. which fabricates PE-PP separators under the name of 
UPORE R (cid:4). Despite the low prices of the raw materials, the complex 
fabrication processes increase the cost of these separators.

Many strategies have been pursued to improve the performance 
of polyoleﬁn separators. High surface-area metal oxide particles in- 
3  have been dispersed into PP mem- 
cluding ZnO, SiO 
branes as they show the ability of adsorbing the impurities formed 
during  cycling  and,  at  the  same  time,  enhance  the  wettability 
to liquid electrolyte and its retention, providing composite mem- 
branes  with  good  capacity  retention  [278] .  PE  membranes  have 
2  nanoparticles via chemical vapor 
been coated by depositing SiO 
deposition (CVD) to obtain membranes with improved thermal and 
dimensional stability at high temperature and extended cycle life. 
Interestingly, the separator is highly stable at temperatures above 
the melting point of the PE. Satisfactory cell performance in terms 
of ion conductivity, C-rate and cycle life were obtained, introduc- 
ing a new approach for LIB separators that can potentially limit 
unwanted explosion events [279] . Similarly, 6 nm thick Al 
3 has 
been grown on a commercial porous PP separator (Celgard 2500) 
by atomic layer deposition (ALD) in order to prevent the marked 
thermal shrinkage of neat PP and improve its wettability with ex- 
tremely polar electrolytes such as pure propylene carbonate. Inter- 
estingly, such a thin layer does not increase, in a signiﬁcant way, 
the overall thickness of the separator while keeps the electrochem- 
ical performance of the cell (capacity, rate capability, and cycle life) 
in extremely polar electrolytes [280] . A 9 nm thick boron-nitride 

2 O 

(BN) nanosheet layer was coated onto one side of a commercial 
separator (Celgard 2325) by vacuum ﬁltration [281] . When using 
a conventional organic carbonate-based electrolyte, the more ho- 
mogeneous thermal distribution resulting from the BN coating and 
the smaller surface area of initial Li deposition results in a more 
uniform deposition/striping of Li, decreasing the risk of dendritic 
Li growth and improving cycling performance. PP separators (Cel- 
2 layer (up to 131 nm thick) by 
gard 2400) were coated with a TiO 
magnetron sputtering deposition (MSD) to yield membranes with 
an improved stability against thermal degradation of about 100 °C, 
a 2 to 4 fold reduced thermal shrinkage and an improved wetta- 
bility with polar electrolytes as evidenced by the larger electrolyte 
uptake  and  lower  water  contact  angle  values  [268] .  As  a  result, 
composite separators with improved safety and capacity retention 
(84.0% after 100 cycles in comparison with 72.3% for neat PP) were 
obtained. A separator membrane composed by PE-PP sheath-core 
ﬁbres fabricated via air-laid method was reinforced with nanosilica 
particles to obtain improved wettability and better electrochemi- 
cal performance than the bare separator [282] . More interestingly, 
the cells comprising nanosilica-reinforced PE-PP nonwovens were 
thermally stable at 150 °C, while the cell with the commercial Cel- 
gard membrane showed a short circuit as a result of the thermal 
shrinkage of the separator, which is about 37% in comparison with 
the 3% of the reinforced separator. 

Overall, polyoleﬁns display a poor thermal stability, are highly 
inﬂammable and their hydrophobic character results in poor wet- 
ting capability, leading to a signiﬁcant decrease in ionic conduc- 
tivity  and  ultimately  to  low  power  densities  [222] .  Considering 
these drawbacks and despite of their wide commercialization, re- 
cent efforts carried out regarding polyoleﬁn separators are basically 
aimed to improve their wettability and thermal stability, which can 
be accomplished through plasma treatment [283] , polymer grafting 
[284] , and surface chemical modiﬁcation [285] . Therefore, alterna- 
tive materials with better thermal stability, mechanical robustness, 
proper  wettability  and  easily  controllable  morphology  are  being 
developed. 

Poly(vinylidene diﬂuoride): (PVDF) is a semicrystalline polymer 
which shows good mechanical properties, high chemical resistance 
and  displays  a  high  polarity  and  dielectric  constant,  which  im- 
proves the ionization of lithium salts [228] . PVDF offers a wide va- 
riety of possibilities to control its morphology through binary and 
ternary polymer/solvent systems and it presents a high anodic sta- 
bility thanks to the strong electron-withdrawing functional groups 
(-C-F-) [286] . As a result, PVDF has been proven as eﬃcient battery 
separator  when  soaked  with  liquid  electrolytes  such  as  LiPF 
6  or 
lithium bis(triﬂuoromethane sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), although the 
interaction between PVDF ﬂuorine atoms and lithium ions could 
lead to the formation of lithium ﬂuoride (LiF). As shown in Fig. 11 c, 
microporous sponge-like PVDF membranes with good wettability, 
mechanical properties and electrochemical stability have been fab- 
ricated through thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) method 
[287] . The high dielectric constant ( ε) of 8.4 of PVDF allows its fab- 
rication into the form of electrospun separators, where voltages in 
the range of 8 to 15 kV can control the diameter of the nanoﬁbers 
from 884 to 514 nm respectively [288] . PVDF nonwoven mats were 
prepared as LIB separators, where the high porosity and large sur- 
face area of the membranes combined with the swelling ability of 
electrospun ﬁbres resulted in high electrolyte uptake [289] . As a 
result of their 3D network formed by interconnected ﬁbres, when 
soaked in liquid electrolyte the nonwoven mats kept their struc- 
tural integrity and show good mechanical strength [290] . One ad- 
vantage of preparing nonwoven PVDF mats is that although the ﬁ- 
bres are composed by highly oriented chains, their degree of crys- 
tallinity is rather low, supporting the Li + diffusion process [288] . 

As the crystalline regions hinder Li + ion mobility in polymeric 
membranes,  batteries  with  separators  composed  by  semicrys-

talline  polymers  usually  display  low  charge-discharge  capacity 
and  poor  C-rates  [ 10 , 222 ].  Therefore,  PVDF-based  copolymers 
such  as  poly(vinylidene  ﬂuoride-co-hexaﬂuoropropylene)  (PVDF- 
HFP),  poly(vinylidene  ﬂuoride-co-chlorotriﬂuoroethylene)  (PVDF- 
CTFE)  and  poly  (vinylidene  ﬂuoride-cotriﬂuoroethylene)  (PVDF–
TrFE) have been used as LIB separators to obtain improved ionic 
conductivity,  mechanical  ﬂexibility,  compatibility  with  electrodes 
and low degree of crystallinity [291] . In this sense, Fig. 12 shows 
the correlation between the β phase content in membranes com- 
posed  by  PVDF  and  its  copolymers  (having  the  same  degree  of 
porosity and degree of crystallinity) and their cycling performance 
[292] . Overall, larger β-phase contents (a highly polar phase) facil- 
itates faster lithium ion migration through the interaction between 
lithium ions and the ﬂuorine atoms present into polymer chains. 

In  such  copolymers,  amorphous  swollen  regions,  for  example 
HFP in a PVDF-HFP copolymer, retain large amounts of liquid elec- 
trolyte, while the crystalline PVDF phase provides mechanical sup- 
port [293] and PVDF-TrFE [294] . However, although Li intercalation 
and deintercalation process proceeds with low internal resistance, 
their low melting temperature together with their relatively poor 
mechanical strength remains a limitation for their practical use as 
separators.  In  this  sense,  PVDF  has  been  reinforced  with  ﬁllers, 
blended with other polymers or used as a multi-layered material 
in order to improve its ionic conductivity and thermo-mechanical 
properties.

2  nanoﬁbers with a nanoparticle concentration up to 
24 wt% were obtained by a combination of electrospining and elec- 
trospraying. An increase in ionic conductivity up to 289% and elec- 
trolyte uptake of 370% was observed as a result of the high SiO 
2 
aﬃnity with the electrolyte. A discharge capacity of 95 mA h  g −1 
was  observed  at  8C,  which  contrast  with  the  67  mA  h  g −1  ob- 
tained  using  a  commercial  PP  separator  [295] .  PVDF  composites 
3  [297] were de- 
with TiO 
veloped  as  battery  separators  with  the  objective  to  increase  the 
ionic conductivity. SiO 
2 particles have been also in- 
2 and TiO 
corporated into microporous PVDF-HFP membranes via phase in- 
version method using deionized water as a non-solvent and ace- 
tone as solvent. The obtained membranes showed a proper con- 
trol over pore-morphology leading to increased wettability, ionic 
conductivity and electrochemical stability [298–300] . Al 
3 parti- 
cles  have  been  proven  to  effectively  weaken  the  interaction  be- 
tween  the  ﬂuorine  atoms  in  PVDF  and  lithium  ions,  increasing 
the  ionic conductivity  and  Li +  transference number  when incor- 
porated into PVDF and PVDF-HFP [ 301 , 302 ]. The addition of Al 
2 O 
3 
into  a  PVDF-HFP  matrix  serves  to  increase  the  thermal  conduc- 
tivity of the membrane up to ﬁve times more than that of com- 
mercial polyoleﬁns, which improves heat dissipation in the battery 

2 O 

and reduces explosion risks [303] . Other PVDF-based composites 
with improved cell-performance have been obtained by incorporat- 
ing montmorillonite (MMT) [304] , NaY zeolites [ 305 , 65 ], or barium 
titanate (BaTiO 

3 ) [265] . 

Many  PVDF  blends  were  obtained  for  separator  materials, 
including  those  with  poly(methyl  methacrylate)  (PMMA)  [306] , 
polyacrylonitrile  (PAN)  [307] ,  poly(ethylene  oxide)  (PEO)  [308] , 
poly(ethylene  glycol)  (PEG)  [309] ,  poly(methyl  methacrylate-co- 
poly(ethylene  glycol)  methacrylate)  (P(MMA-co-PEGMA)  [310] , 
and  (poly(dimethyl  siloxane)  graft  poly(propylene  oxide)-block- 
poly(ethylene oxide) (PDMS-g-(PPO-PEO) [311] . These blends pro- 
vide complementary properties in relation to PVDF, and are aimed 
to  improve  the  ionic  conductivity,  mechanical  stability,  electro- 
chemical stability window and cycling battery performance. 

In addition, PVDF-TrFE has been reinforced with MMT, BaTiO 
3 , 
NaY and CNT in order to  improve the performance of the  host- 
ing  matrix  as  shown  in  Fig.  13  [312] .  It  is  observed  that  PVDF- 
TrFE membranes reinforced with MMT show the best overall per- 
formance among the evaluated ﬁllers [312] . For example, thanks to 
an improved anode-separator interface provided by the interaction 
between the oxide anode and the same oxide incorporated into the 
separator, a 4 wt% addition of CuO nanoparticles (~350 nm) into a 
PVDF-HFP separator has been shown to increase the capacity by 
13% when a CuO anode is used in a LIB [313] . 

Multilayered  separators  were  obtained  after  the  coating  of 
PVDF  onto  commercial  Celgard® membranes  by  electrospinning 
to improve electrolyte absorption and separator-electrode interface 
[314] .  Zhu  et  al.  showed  the  development  of  a  ﬂame  retarding 
material upon the coating of a PVDF layer onto a nonwoven Cel- 
gard 2730 commercial separator consisting of PE and PP [315] . The 
ionic  conductivity  of  the  separator  soaked  with  1  M  LiPF 
6  solu- 
tion in EC/DMC/EMC (1/1/1) electrolyte showed an ionic conduc- 
tivity  of  0.30  mS  cm −1 ,  which  is  above  the  corresponding  com- 
mercial  separator  (0.21  mS  cm −1 ).  A  doubled  lithium  ion  trans- 
ference number was also obtained upon PVDF coating, which to- 
gether with the self-extinguishing behavior of the separator make 
these  membranes  attractive  for  large-scale  battery  systems  re- 
quiring high safety and low cost. The hydrogen bond network of 
poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) layer when sandwiched 
between PVDF membranes provides an excellent mechanical per- 
formance  to  the  system,  limiting  the  thermal  shrinkage  at  high 
temperatures  (180  °C)  and  improving  the  rate  performance  in 
comparison  with  Celgard® commercial  separator  [316] .  In  order 
to improve separator wettability, ionic conductivity and mechani- 
cal/electrochemical stability, PVDF was coated onto PE, PP and PET 
porous membranes [ 258 , 317 , 318 ]. For example, a PVDF-HFP porous 
structure has been embedded together with a PET membrane to

obtain  superior  cell  performance  as  a  result  of  the  nanoporous 
structure that allows an easy ion transport [70] . 

Recently, a strategy aimed to improve the properties of dual- 
layers  based  on  PET  [319]  and  hydroxyl–terminated  polybutadi- 
ene grafted methoxyl polyethylene glycol (HTPB-g-MPEG) [320] has 
been  reported  using  a  plasma  treatment,  resulting  in  improved 
electrolyte aﬃnity through the incorporation of oxygen moieties on 
their surface [283] . 

Polyacrylonitrile : (PAN) is a semicrystalline polymer which apart 
from being compatible with many salts, exhibits good processabil- 
ity, small diffusion resistance, good thermal stability, proper wetta- 
bility and excellent electrochemical stability [321] . The interaction 
between the C ≡N nitrile groups of PAN with lithium ions in liquid 
electrolytes and the carbonyl groups in the solvent yields mem- 
branes  with  high  ionic  conductivities,  making  this  material  very 
useful for LIB separators. One of the drawbacks associated with the 
use of PAN as LIB separator is that electrolyte leakage events may 
occur after long-term storage [322] . 

Electrospun  nonwoven  PAN  mats  show  high  electrolyte  up- 
take, high ionic conductivity, good swelling capacity and are able 
to  keep  their  original  porous  structure  after  prolonged  charge- 
discharge  cycles  [323] .  PAN  nanoﬁbre  based  nonwovens  for  LIB 
separators  have  been  prepared  [324] ,  showing  higher  ionic  con- 
ductivities than commercial ones in the −10 to 60 °C temperature 
range, with better  cycling performance, C-rate and a remarkable 
electrochemical stability in the voltage range of −0.5 to 4.5 V vs. 
Li 0 /Li + . Hot-pressed electrospun PAN nanoﬁbrous membranes also 
show larger electrolyte uptake, higher thermal stability, wider elec- 
trochemical  potential  window,  higher  ion  permeability  and  bet- 
ter electrochemical performance than commercial PP membranes 
[325] .  The  performance  of  bare  PAN  membranes  has  been  fur- 
ther improved through the fabrication of microporous PAN/PU non- 
woven composites prepared by multi-needle electrospinning tech- 
nique [326] . Non-ﬂammable membranes when exposed to naked 
ﬂame with ionic conductivities as high as 2.07 S cm −1  and with 
an anodic stability up to 5.1 V were obtained. PAN has been used 
in order to increase the ionic conductivity of other hosting matri- 
ces upon blending. With the aim of increasing cycling stability and 

compatibility with the liquid electrolyte solution, PAN electrospun 
nanoﬁber membranes were prepared and subsequently oxidized by 
varying the heat treatment time [327] . 

For example, increased ionic conductivity of microporous PVDF- 
HFP/PAN  membranes  upon  increasing  PAN  fraction  has  been 
demonstrated,  offering  better  electrochemical  performance  than 
membranes composed by PVDF-HFP and PAN [307] . Similarly, PAN 
has been blended with PVA [328] , and PMMA [329] , while com- 
posites with improved electrochemical performance have been ob- 
tained upon the addition of graphene nanoﬂakes [330] , SiO 
2 [331] , 
or lignin [332] . 

Polyethylene  terephthalate :  (PET)  is  one  of  the  most  common 
thermoplastics within the polyester family. It shows good mechan- 
ical properties, excellent electronic insulation and, more interest- 
ingly, its high melting temperature of about 255 °C provides PET a 
remarkable ability of enduring high temperature exposure far su- 
perior to that of other separators composed by polyoleﬁns or PVDF 
[237] . PET nonwoven separators have been prepared via electro- 
6 /EC-DMC) 
spinning  technique  with  a  484%  electrolyte  (1  M  LiPF 
uptake in the ﬁrst 10 min, the cells assembled using PET showing a 
better cycling capacity and higher discharge capacity than the ones 
using commerciar Celgard separators [237] . 

A PVDF nanoﬁber layer deposited onto a PET microﬁber support 
has been presented, where the PVDF layer improves the wettabil- 
ity of the membrane with increased porosity and surface area and 
PET provides enough mechanical support and dimensional stabil- 
ity at high temperatures [333] . A shutdown temperature of 131 °C 
was obtained as a result of the PVDF layer melting, while the melt- 
down temperature of 252 °C of PET can prevent the cell temper- 
ature from increasing before actually starting to cool down after 
cell  shutdown.  PET  has  been  used  in  commercial  separators  al- 
though they are not as common as polyoleﬁn separators. A series 
of Separion (trade name) separators composed by a nonwoven PET 
membrane  coated  with  Al 
2  have  been  developed  to  pro- 
vide membranes with dendrite penetration resistance, good ther- 
mal stability up to 220 °C and a dimensional shrinkage 3 times 
lower than commercial polyoleﬁn membranes [223] . When work- 
ing  at  150  °C,  cells  with  Separion  separators  showed  no  change

while  the  cells  with  PE  separators  suffered  short  circuit  events 
due  to  the  marked  shrinkage  of  the  separator.  In  other  work,  a 
nonwoven PET layer was sandwhiched between poly(vinyl alcohol- 
co-ethylene) membranes to obtain high electrolyte wettability and 
ionic conductivities comparable to commercial PP separators [334] . 
A  nonwoven  PET  was  used  onto  a  PP  separator  to  improve  the 
electrolyte aﬃnity, obtaining an excellent discharge capacity and 
superior  thermal  stability  [335] .  Other  similar  separator  mem- 
branes have been also produced, such as a poly(vinyl alcohol-co- 
ethylene)/PET nanoporous membrane having a high porosity and 
low thermal shrinkage [334] . 

Polyimide:  (PI)  is  a  high  performance  engineering  polymer 
which  shows  a  thermal  stability  up  to  500  °C,  proper  chemical 
resistance, excellent mechanical performance and good electrolyte 
wettability thanks to its polar groups [336] . Considering its high 
thermal  resistance,  different  separators  were  produced  by  non- 
solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) [337] and phase inversion 
methods using soluble polyimide (SPI) containing triﬂuoromethyl 
substituent.  This  material  is  synthesized  from  1,4-bis(4-amino- 
2-triﬂuoromethylphenoxy)benzene (6FAPB) and 4,4 (cid:6) -oxydiphthalic 
anhydride (ODPA) [338] . Electrospun PI membranes (see the mor- 
phology in Fig. 11 d) with thicknesses ranging from 40 to 100 μm 
showed a better rate capability in comparison with Celgard R (cid:4) sep- 
arator at current densities as high as 10 C [277] . Electrospun poly- 
imide nonwovens have been developed by addition of trace plasti- 
cizer in order to enhance the mechanical properties [339] . Porous 
PI membranes were prepared using a wet phase inversion process, 
which showed an excellent thermal stability with glass transition 
temperature  of  274  °C  and  a  thermal  shrinkage  below  1%  when 
stored at 200 °C [340] . PI (PMDA-ODA) nonwoven membranes ob- 
tained after the thermal imidization of poly(amic acid) exhibit ca- 
pacity retention over the discharge rate of 0.2–10 C, making them 
suitable candidates for high-rate LIBs [277] . This was further con- 
ﬁrmed by showing that a non-woven separator prepared via elec- 
trospinning with uniformly dispersed 491 nm diameter ﬁbres and 
a porosity > 90% presents a capacity retention ratio of 33.6% at 
super  high  discharge  rate  of  28.8  C,  while  the  capacity  remains 
99.66% after 320 cycles at 5 C rate [341] . PI separators prepared 
by electrospining and subsequent thermal imidization result good 
candidates for high temperature operation (120 °C) owing to their 
high oxidative potential above 4.5 V, no thermal shrinkage, excel- 
lent lithium deposition-stripping performance and good ionic con- 
ductivity,  which  results  in  stable  charge–discharge  proﬁles  with 
satisfactory cyclability [342] . 

The electrochemical performance of PI has been upgraded ei- 
ther by blending it with other polymers or through composite de- 
velopment. As depicted in Fig. 14 , a thin Al 
3  layer was coated 
onto  PI  membranes  to  obtain  separators  with  a  markedly  lower 
thermal shrinkage and bulk resistance than bare uncoated mem- 
branes, resulting in a dramatic improved rate capability in com-

parison with commercial PP membranes, especially at high rates 
3 coating also increases the ionic conductivity and alle- 
[343] . Al 
viated the increase of cell impedance, resulting in separators with 
a rate capability of 78.9% at 10 C in comparison 68.6 and 18.2% for 
un-coated  PI  and  commercial  PP  separators  respectively.  PI/glass 
microﬁber membranes fabricated via dip-coating show a great po- 
tential for high-temperature applications as they show an excellent 
wettability, do not catch ﬁre in the ﬂame, do not display shrinkage 
at temperatures as high as 200 °C and show a stable cycling at 
120 °C [344] . Hydrophilic SiO 
2 has been incorporated within a PI 
matrix to further upgrade electrolyte uptake and ionic conductivity 
[ 343 , 345 ]. A trilayer Pi/Cu/PI separator was prepared to obtain sep- 
arators with eﬃcient alarm response against Li penetration, open- 
ing up the opportunity for safer battery design by separator engi- 
neering [346] . 

Electrospun  PI  nanoﬁbres  were  coated  onto  PET  nonwovens 
to obtain improved electrolyte uptake, 2% dimensional shrinkage 
at  180  °C  and  a  capacity  retention  of  87.5%  after  50  cycles  at 
10 C [347] . Core-sheath PI@PVDF-HFP were fabricated to combine 
good mechanical/thermal properties and ionic conductivity [348] . 
PI membranes with a controllable shutdown function in the 120–
200 °C range have been prepared by coating a PE layer onto elec- 
trospun PI ﬁbers [349] . Similarly, sandwich-type PI/PVDF/PI mem- 
branes were synthesized through electrospinning to obtain shut- 
down function as the intermediate PVDF layer melts at 170 °C to 
ﬁll the pores within PI. Electrolyte uptake up to 476%, an ionic con- 
ductivity of 3.46 mS • cm −1  and a low speciﬁc capacity decay rate 
of 2.9% after 100 cycles under 0.5C-rate discharges were obtained 
[350] . 

A  PI-based  mechanically  ﬂexible  but  strong  non-ﬂammable 
separator  which  withstands  bending,  cutting  and  nail  penetra- 
tion has been recently proposed [351] . The 8.6- μm-thick separa- 
tor  was  obtained  upon  the  ﬁlling  of  a  nanoporous  PI  ﬁlm  with 
PEO/LiTFSI. The vertical nanochannels in the separator provide high 
ionic  conductivities  up  to  2.3 • 10 −4  S  cm −1 ,  opening  new  strate- 
gies  to  develop  safe  and  ﬂexible  high  energy  density  LIBs.  Dual 
redox-active polyimides based on phenothiazine and naphthalene 
tetracarboxylic dianhydride show a great potential to be used si- 
multaneously as anode and cathode materials as they can deliver 
a high power density up to 1542 W kg −1  with stable cycling for 
10 0 0 cycles at current densities as high as 800 mA g −1 , opening 
the path towards symmetric polymer batteries [352] . 

Poly(aryl ether ketone): (PAEK), a family of semi-crystalline ther- 
moplastics  that  presents  an  excellent  thermal  oxidative  stability, 
good mechanical properties and good chemical stability [353] , has 
been  used  as  separator  material  in  LIBs  [ 354 , 355 ].  The  aromatic 
main  chains  provide  excellent  thermal  and  mechanical  stability, 
while  the  polar  ether/ketone  groups  strongly  interact  with  car- 
bonate electrolytes, resulting in improved power densities. Novel 
porous separators based on PAEK were prepared by selective re-

moval of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) chains on their structure [356] . One 
of  the  best  known  types  of  PAEK  is  the  high-performance  engi- 
neering semicrystalline poly(ether ketone) (PEEK). Its melting tem- 
perature is above 330 °C, it shows a negligible thermally-induced 
shrinkage,  it  is  highly  chemically  stable  and  it  shows  very  low 
ﬂammability. Despite these favourable characteristics, its poor sol- 
ubility (usually H 
4  needs to be used) has limited its used as 
LIB separator as membrane fabrication results somewhat danger- 
ous. Porous PEEK membranes with symmetric sponge-like struc- 
ture have been prepared by phase inversion method. The obtained 
membranes showed a 251% electrolyte uptake, high thermal stabil- 
ity and a discharge capacity of 124.1 mA h g −1 at 5 C [355] . 

2 SO 

In an attempt to improve its performance as separator mate- 
rial,  PEEK  has  been  modiﬁed  to  obtain  the  so-called  sulfonated 
poly(ether  ketone)  (SPEEK),  which  is  a  low  cost  non-ﬂuorinated 
ionomer membrane with adequate ionic conductivity, good ther- 
mal and mechanical stability and low cost [357] . SPEEK can be ob- 
tained upon sulfonation of raw PEEK, where large sulfonation re- 
sults in an increased ionic conductivity at expenses of mechani- 
cal strength [358] . Typically, 6 g of PEEK are poured into 100 mL 
concentrated sulphuric acid at 50 °C. The sulfonation reaction can 
proceed for different times and could be quenched by precipitating 
the resulting mixture iced water. 

Polytetraﬂuoroethylene:  In  an  attempt  to  look  for  cheap 
high-performance  separators,  polytetraﬂuoroethylene  (PTFE)  has 
emerged  as  a  novel  material  as  it  is  chemically  inert,  it  shows 
a  zero-static  discharge,  it  has  a  high  dielectric  breakdown  volt- 
age  and  possess  good  mechanical  properties.  Electrospun  PTFE 
nanoﬁber membranes with thermal stability, electrochemical sta- 
bility (up to 5.5 V versus Li/Li + ) and rate performance better than 
that of the conventional polyoleﬁn separators where obtained, pro- 
viding enhanced safety to the cell [240] . 

PTFE  blends  have  also  been  used  for  LIB  separators.  A 
PTEF/PVDF-HFP separator was designed to absorb large amounts of 
liquid electrolyte at the same time that the mechanical stability of 
the membrane is maintained [359] PVDF-HFP enhances the wet- 
tability and acts as shutdown element, while PTFE provides good 
mechanical stability even at elevated temperatures. Similarly, cal- 
cium carbonate (CaCO 
3 ) has been incorporated into a PTFE matrix 
to obtain composite ﬁlms with good dimensional stability at high 
temperatures, excellent wettability and able to suppress the forma- 
tion of hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) [360] . In LIBs, HF develops as a con- 
sequence of the LiPF 
6 hydrolysis, resulting in one of the most rel- 
evant causes for capacity fade. The obtained membranes show an 
ionic conductivity of 2.4 mS cm −1 at 20 °C after being soaked with 
liquid electrolyte (in comparison with 8.0 mS cm −1  of the liquid 
electrolyte) and show a superior cycling performance as a result of 
the ability of alkaline CaCO 

3 to scavenge acidic impurities 

Polyurethanes: (PU) are a group of thermoplastic materials com- 
posed of phase separated hard and soft domains; whereas the soft 
segments (polyether or polyester) have the ability of dissolve alkali 
metals,  the  hard  segments  (diisocyanates)  act  as  physical  cross- 
link sites, providing good mechanical performance to the system 
[361] . As a result of their low cost, stretchy character, high thermal 
stability and proper electrolyte wettability, PUs have been used as 
separator membranes to build full-cells in the form of clothes and 
watchstraps which show comparable electrochemical performance 
to those of conventional cells even under severe folding −unfolding 
motions, opening the path towards ﬂexible energy storage systems 
[362] . A porous PU/PVDF membrane has been reported as a separa- 
tor that sticks to the electrodes, a key aspect for the development 
of cost-effective wavy battery with high stretchability [189] . Other 
separators using PUs include electrospun PAN/PU separators [326] , 
and high performance SiO 

2 /PEI-PU membranes [363] . 

Polydopamine: Thanks to its hydroxyl and amino groups, poly- 
dopamine (PDA) can be used as a coating to increase the surface 

energy of the membranes and therefore, their wettability with the 
electrolyte.  It  also  protects  against  dimensional  shrinkage  when 
used at high temperatures at the same time that protects active 
materials from unwanted side reactions with electrolytes. Its cat- 
echol groups adhere to the electrodes, increasing the life cycle of 
LIBs [364] . As shown in Fig. 15 , a PDA surface coating has been 
applied onto PE separators to modify the surface properties; i.e., 
electrolyte  wettability  and  uptake  was  improved  while  porosity 
and  Gurley  number  remained  intact,  yielding  to  increased  ionic 
conductivities,  enhanced  cycle  life  and  improved  C-rate  [365] .  A 
mussel-inspired PDA coating has been applied onto a PEG-coated 
PP separators to obtain enhanced cell performance as a result of 
improved aﬃnity of the separator membrane with the liquid elec- 
trolyte [366] . PDA-coated PVDF electrospun nonwoven membranes 
display  an  improved  cycling  performance  and  power  capability 
than the uncoated PVDF as a result of the combined effects of an 
increased electrolyte aﬃnity provided by the PDA layer, enhanced 
ionic conductivity and catechol adhesion between electrodes and 
the separator [367] . PDA has been coated onto other porous struc- 
tures such as PP [368] , cellulose microﬁbrillated membrane [369] , 
poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membranes [369] , or PP–PE–PP separa- 
tors [370] . 

Poly(methyl methacrylate): (PMMA) is a transparent amorphous 
thermoplastic material that presents a high aﬃnity towards liquid 
electrolytes. PMMA membranes have shown high ionic conductiv- 
ity, good thermal and electrochemical stability and remarkable ad- 
hesion with electrodes as it forms a gel when soaked with liquid 
electrolyte, although its poor mechanical performance has limited 
its used as LIB separators. In spite of this, the inherent electrolyte 
aﬃnity  of  PMMA  has  been  used  to  upgrade  the  electrochemical 
performance of other polymer membranes. Grafting a PMMA layer 
onto PE membranes by electron beam irradiation has been proven 
as an eﬃcient approach to improve electrolyte uptake and reten- 
tion, increasing cell performance [371] . Similarly, the PMMA phase 
in  PAN/PMMA  nonwoven  mats  prepared  by  electrospinning  pro- 
vides a good compatibility with the liquid electrolyte to yield an 
ionic conductivity of 3.6 mS cm −1 [372] . PMMA has been blended 
with PVDF and PVC microporous membranes to obtain separators 
where blends having 60 wt% of PMMA showed a favourable ionic 
conductivity and lithium self-diffusion thanks to the gel-forming 
capability of PMMA upon being soaked with the liquid electrolyte 
[ 373 , 374 ]. Multilayer membranes with unique structures have been 
prepared upon the preparation of a close-packed PMMA nanoparti- 
cle arrays onto a PE [244] . A highly ordered porous structure with 
well-connected interstitial voids was obtained by PMMA nanopar- 
ticle coating, facilitating the electrolyte wettability and uptake. As a 
consequence of the well-developed ordered morphology, the ionic 
conductivity of the PMMA nanoparticle arrays-coated separator in- 
creased up to 0.52 mS cm −1 in comparison with the 0.31 mS cm −1 
obtained for the separator coated with a dense PMMA layer. Com- 
3  coating 
posites  having  PMMA  were  also  reported.  A  thin  Al 
on both sides of a PMMA membrane was applied by dip coating 
method using PVDF-HFP as a binder at a 9:1 ratio (Al 
3 to PVDF- 
HFP) to obtain a tri-layer separator with a remarkable thermal sta- 
bility thanks to the inorganic layers and good capacity retention at 
2  microspheres 
high rates [375] . In other work, PMMA-coated SiO 
where  deposited  onto  a  PE  separator  to  improve  electrolyte  ab- 
sorption, while the cycle performance and C-rate capability are in- 
2 [376] .

Cellulose  and  derivatives:  Cellulose,  as  the  most  abundant 
biopolymer on the biosphere, is a promising material to develop 
environmentally  benign  LIBs  [377] .  Cellulose  has  been  tradition- 
ally used in the form of wood for construction purposes, as ﬁber 
for  textile  applications,  as  paper  or  as  reinforcing  element  for 
polymers. The use of cellulose-derived separators by common pa- 
permaking  approaches  results  a  suitable  solution  to  the  expen-

sive fabrication methods and disposal issues associated with tra- 
ditional microporous polymer membranes. Although paper-sheets 
have  been  used  in  alkaline  batteries  provided  their  wettability, 
porosity, low density and easy of processing [378] , their applica- 
tion in LIBs has been limited due to its hygroscopic character as 
water contents bellow 20–50 ppm are required to avoid LiPF 
6 hy- 
drolysis and HF formation [379] . 

Several cellulose derivatives have been used so far as LIB sep- 
arators. For example, ethyl cellulose (EC) was coated onto mono- 
layer PE and trilayer PP-PE-PP separators by simple dipping pro- 
cess, leading to increased electrolyte capacity retention from 28% 
to  99%  and  a  decrease  in  the  thermal  shrinkage  from  20%  to 
9%  at  shutdown  temperature  [380] .  A  porous  cellulose  diacetate 
(CDA)-SiO 
2  composite was coated onto a PE membrane to obtain 
increased  ionic  conductivity,  electrolyte  wettability  and  thermo- 
2 layer success- 
mechanical properties. More interestingly, CDA-SiO 
fully suppresses dendrite growth and promotes the formation of 
a stable SEI, resulting in a plausible approach towards safer LIBs 
[381] . Using electrospining technique, a non-woven mat of cellu- 
lose acetate (CA) was coated onto a PVDF-HFP ﬁlm to obatin im- 
proved capacity retention and rate capability in comparison with 
commercial PP separators [382] . Remarkable ionic conductivity of 
4  × 10 −3  S cm −1  at room  temperature  (higher  than  the  10 −3

6  electrolyte  in  1:1  EC:PC)  was 
obtained  by  blending  a  cyanoethylated  cellulose  derivative  with 
PVDF-HFP and subsequently dissolving the mixture in dimethylfor- 
mamide to obtain microporous membranes [383] . 

Membranes  composed  by  cellulosic  ﬁbres  have  also  been 
demonstrated eﬃcient as LIB separators. It was already shown in 
1996  that  after  being  soaked  in  an  aprotic  solvent,  membranes 
based of ﬁbrilliform cellulosic ﬁbres (diameters 0.5–5.0 μm) em- 
bedded  in  a  microporous  cellulosic  matrix  display  a  complex 
impedance lower than conventional polyoleﬁn separators while be- 
ing  “pinhole-free” and  maintaining proper mechanical properties 
[270] .  Rice  paper  consisting  on  large  ﬁbres  of  5–40  μm  in  di- 
ameter has been also proven to be electrochemically stable when 
used  as  separators  for  LIBs  [384] .  Currently,  nanocelluloses,  ei- 
ther cellulose nanoﬁbers (CNFs), cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) or 
bacterial  cellulose  (BC)  have  attracted  an  increasing  interest  for 
the  development  of  novel  LIBs  separators  thanks  to  their  inher- 

ent strength, surface chemistry, and biodegradability. Interestingly, 
the low coeﬃcient of thermal expansion (CTE) of about 10 −7 • K −1 
of  cellulose-based  nanopapers  make  them  interesting  candidates 
for high-temperature environment applications [385] . In this line, 
non-woven membranes composed by CNFs fabricated by high pres- 
sure  homogenization  showed  improved  thermal  and  mechanical 
resistance in comparison with Celgard R (cid:4) membranes [386] . Simi- 
larly, in comparison with PP separators, cellulose-based compos- 
ite nonwoven (FCCN) separators present improved shrinkage resis- 
tance,  combustion  behavior,  rate  capability  at  room  temperature 
and  more  interestingly,  cycle  performance  at  high  temperatures 
(120 °C) [219] as shown in Fig. 16 . Covalently linked bacterial cellu- 
lose nanoﬁber separators display high-strength and excellent ther- 
mal and dimensional stabilities, having better cycling performance 
and rate capability to Celgard R (cid:4) separators [227] . The characteris- 
tic nanoscale labyrinth morphology of bacterial cellulose nanoﬁber 
separators results in enhanced electrolyte wettabilities, increased 
ionic conductivity and reduced thermal shrinkage in comparison 
with commercial polyoleﬁn separators [226] . High speciﬁc surface 
area  (172  m 2  g −1 )  mesoporous  membranes  consisting  on  CNCs 
show a good electrolyte aﬃnity with both conventional 1 M LiPF 
6 
in  EC-DMC  and  ionic  liquids,  resulting  in  ionic  conductivities  as 
high as 2.7 mS cm −1 [246] . It has been shown that mesopores pro- 
vide eﬃcient paths for Li + ion migration through the membrane, 
delivering a speciﬁc capacity of 122 mAh g −1 at a C/2 rate. More- 
over, a single ion conductor behavior of such membranes can be 
obtained upon lithiation of the -OSO 
3 H groups on the surface of 
the CNCs. The obtained impressive high Li +  transference number 
of = 0.9 enables a smooth Li metal deposition and stable cycling 
of Li- LiFePO 

A 35 μm thick mesoporous separators from nanometric cellu- 
lose ﬁbres showed good mechanical properties, wettability, ther- 
mal  stability  at  150  °C,  ionic  conductivity  of  0.4  mS  cm −1  and 
electrochemically inertness in the potential range between 0 and 
5 V vs. Li/Li + [388] . The performance nanocellulose-based separa- 
tors could be further upgraded through mussel-inspired PDA coat- 
ing [369] , or through the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles 
such  as  SiO 
3  [390] .  Nanocelluloses  are  also  be- 
ing  used  as  a  reinforcing  phase  in  polymer  separators  with  the 
main aim of improving the mechanical response of the membrane.

In this line, CNCs where incorporated into a PVDF and PVDF-HFP 
matrices  to  obtain porous  separators with  a  remarkable  thermal 
stabilization at temperatures higher than the melting temperature 
of the PVDF as a result of the rigid percolating network formed 
by CNCs [ 391 , 392 ]. Recently, electrospun cellulose nanoﬁber mem- 
branes  have  been  produced  as  separators  with  ﬂame  resistance 
properties [393] . Also, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF8)-CNF 
nanocomposite  membranes  have  been  synthesized  and  used  as 
separators, allowing to improve the thermal, mechanical and sur- 
face wetting properties of battery separator membranes [394] . 

Other polymers: New promising polymers for LIB separators are 
currently  emerging.  Although  the  most  common  applications  of 
electroactive  polymers  are  found  in  sensors  and  actuators,  elec- 
troactive polymers show a bright future for “smart” separators. The 
fact that such materials exhibit a change in shape when stimulated 
by an electric ﬁeld can be used to fabricate membranes that effec- 
tively shut down the batteries during overcharging. These materi- 
als can be reversibly doped and de-doped to yield electronically 
conductive/insulating  phases  depending  on  the  applied  potential 
so at overcharged voltage they can effectively protect the batteries 
from voltage runaway. Separators composed by redox-active poly- 
mers such as p-polyphenyl (PPP)/polyaniline (PAn) [395] , poly(3- 
butylthiophene) (P3BT) [396] , poly(3-decylthiophene) (P3DT) [397] , 
or polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) [398] , have been fabricated as they 
can be used as a potential-sensitive switch to maintain the charge 
voltage of LIBs at a safety value of few volts with no negative im- 
pact on the charge-discharge cycles. 

Poly(p-phenylene  benzobisoxazole  (PBO),  a  rod-like  aromatic 
heterocyclic polymer consisting of repeating units of benzobisox- 

azole and phenylene functional groups, has been used to fabricate 
ﬂexible  yet  strong  membrane  separators  through  a  simple  blade 
casting  process  [399] .  The  obtained  good  electrolyte  wettability 
and  ionic  conductivity  together  with  its  superior  thermal  stabil- 
ity up to 600 °C and mechanical properties (ultimate strengths of 
525 MPa and Young’s modulus up to 20 GPa) make PBO-nanoﬁber 
separators suitable for lithium dendrite-proof LIBs. 

Considering  the  enormous  relevance of  the  environmental is- 
sues  in  this  area  of  application,  separator  membranes  based  on 
silk  ﬁbroin  have  been  recently  developed  [400] .  In  addition,  the 
effect  of  pore  size  on  silk  ﬁbroin  separators  has  been  studied, 
demonstrating that a higher discharge capacity value is obtained 
for average pore sizes in the range 250–106 μm [401] . It has been 
proven  that  Bombyx  mori  silkworm  cocoons  can  be  used  as  re- 
sources to develop separators for the development of more sus- 
tainable  lithium-ion  batteries  to  improve  environmental  friendli- 
ness and safety in the next generation of energy storage devices 
[402] . 

Overall, separator membranes have been developed using dif- 
ferent  polymer  types  where  each  system  shows  advantages  and 
disadvantages.  Independently  of  the  used  polymer  type,  separa- 
tor membranes should be highly porous with excellent mechanical 
and thermal properties, must show good wettability by the elec- 
trolyte solution and high ionic conductivity values. The develop- 
ment of separators based on natural polymers with high thermal 
stability and compatibility with electrolyte and electrodes emerges 
as a new research area. The proper control of porosity and pore 
size becomes an essential issue, where scalable production tech- 
niques that allow the fabrication of separators at low cost need to

consist on carboxylated or sulfonated anions covalently bonded to 
the polymeric matrix in combination with mobile cations, where 
the high LTN results in improved performances [409] . 

Modern  LIBs  require  solid  electrolytes  capable  of  withstand- 
ing strong thermal and mechanical solicitations. Quite often, SPEs 
fail to provide an eﬃcient protection against short-circuit events 
as their inherent mechanically soft nature allows a relatively easy 
penetration of lithium dendrites through the membrane [410] . In 
1982  Weston  and  Steele  reported  a  pioneering  work  to  provide 
SPEs with increased mechanical properties as they showed a con- 
comitant improvement on both the ionic conductivity and mechan- 
ical stability with the addition of α-Al 
3 inorganic particles into 
PEO, opening the path for the development of composite polymer 
electrolytes (CPEs) [411] . Since then, many effort s have been made 
in the understanding of the impact of different kind of ﬁllers on 
the  electrochemical,  thermal  and  mechanical  properties  of  CPEs 
[ 251 , 412 ].

[406] .  It  shows  a  glass  transition  temperature  ( T g )  and  melting 
temperature  ( T m )  of  −60  and  65  °C,  respectively  and  its  ether 
groups  show  a  high  aﬃnity  to  Li +  ions,  allowing  the  mixing  of 
lithium  salts  within  the  polymer  matrix.  PEO-based  solid  elec- 
trolytes have been highly appealing option thanks to their proper 
compatibility with electrodes, mitigating Li dendrite growth char- 
acteristic of LIBs having liquid electrolytes. In any case, recent stud- 
ies have shown that such systems are not completely thermody- 
namically stable with lithium metal, yielding the formation of an 
intermediate  passivation  layer  [413] .  As  depicted  in  Fig.  18 ,  Li + 
ions are complexed to PEO through ﬁve ether oxygen atoms within 
the PEO chain, where the cation mobility is decreased as a con- 
sequence of their complexation [410] . Therefore, the cation trans- 
port  is  deﬁned  as  the  motion  of  the  Li +  between  complexation 
sites assisted by the segmental motion of the PEO matrix. The suc- 
cess  of  PEO-LiX  SPEs  is  evidenced  by  the  lithium  batteries  that 
power Bluecar, a small four-seat electric car supplied by the Bol- 
loré Group. The car provides an electric range of 250 km in ur- 
ban use and its battery includes a lithium anode, a PEO-lithium 
bis(triﬂuoromethane sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solid electrolyte and a 
4 cathode [155] . As a semicrystalline polymer, the ionic con- 
FePO 
ductivity of PEO markedly drops when large crystalline areas are 
found  as  ionic  conductivities  are  generally  associated  with  the 
amorphous phase. This conductivity decrease is of paramount rel- 
evance when SPEs are used bellow their glass transition temper- 
ature  ( T g ),  where  the  segmental  chain  mobility  is  drastically  re- 
duced. As a result, the ion motion in PEO-LiX SPEs is severely ham- 
pered, yielding ionic conductivities of ~10 −7 S • cm −1 when used at 
room  temperature  [414] .  This  fact  obligates  the  battery  to  oper- 
ate above 60 °C, where all the polymer remains in a viscous liq- 
uid state and acceptable conductivity values of 10 −3 S • cm −1 can be 
reached. The anion mobility along the chain is larger than that of 
the cation, resulting in low lithium transport numbers which can 
be improved by properly selecting salts with larger organic anions 
and huge electron delocalization such as TFSI −[415] . 

Therefore,  an  ideal  SPE  should  present  a  low  T g  to  perverse 
high  lithium  ion  conductivity  at  the  same  time  that  its  rubbery 
state ensures a good stability with both electrodes and preserves 
a  wide  electrochemical  stability.  In  this  sense,  a  plasticizer  with 
high  salt  dissociation  level  such  as  lithium  bis(triﬂuoromethane 
sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) can be added to PEO to increase its ionic 
conductivity  [416] .  The  incorporation  of  plasticizers  or  copoly- 
mers  into  PEO-LiX  can  offer  strategies  to  reduce  both  the  crys- 
tallinity  and  T g ,  increasing  the  electrochemical  stability  and  in- 
hibiting lithium dendrite formation [ 417 , 418 ]. For instance, PEO/PEI 
4 lithium salt show an ionic conductivity as high 
blends with LiClO

be evaluated. Further, the transition from the separator/electrolyte 
pair to solid electrolytes results critical for the fabrication of the 
next generation solid-state batteries. 

3.1.2. Solid electrolytes 

An  ideal  solid  electrolyte  needs  to  fulﬁll  partly  antagonistic 
requirements,  making  its  development  a  challenging  task.  They 
should  be  mechanically ﬂexible  to  allow  as  easy  fabrication and 
optimal solid electrolyte-electrode interface at the same time that 
they  should  present  a  proper  stiffness  and  strength  in  order  to 
limit  dendrite  growth.  More  importantly,  their  ionic  conductiv- 
ity  should  be  high  enough  to  ensure  a  proper  Li +  ion  diffu- 
sion  through  the  membrane  between  the  negative  and  positive 
electrodes.  Limiting  the  charge-transfer  resistance  barrier  at  the 
solid/solid electrode/electrolyte interface is one of the most chal- 
lenging issues that face nowadays solid electrolytes. Contrarily to 
liquid electrolytes which easily penetrate into the electrodes, solid 
electrolytes cannot form a continuous contact with the active ma- 
terial;  i.e.,  the  electrochemical  interface  is  not  continuous.  Since 
charge  transfer  could  only  occur  at  such  contact  points,  a  con- 
tinuous electrode/electrolyte interface is required for high energy 
density LIBs as this ensures an even current distribution through 
the  electrode  material,  avoiding  large  current  density  areas  and 
successfully suppressing dendrite formation [403] . Similarly, suc- 
cessive cycling leads to electrode volume changes, modifying elec- 
trode/electrolyte interface and weakening the connection between 
them. In this framework, malleable solid electrolytes are required 
as  their  shape  may  be  adapted  to  ﬁll  the  voids  between  elec- 
trodes at the same time that a soft SPE may accommodate vol- 
ume changes occurring during charge/discharge, alleviating inter- 
facial strain as shown in Fig. 17 . 

Due to their mechanically soft nature in comparison with solid 
inorganic  electrolytes  (SIE),  solid  polymer  electrolytes  (SPEs)  are 
attractive  materials,  which  successfully  face  most  of  the  above- 
mentioned  issues,  where  SPE  can  be  classiﬁed  as  a  gel  polymer 
electrolyte (GPE) containing high amount of lithium salts or liq- 
uid ionic forming an ion-conducting solution with a suitable me- 
chanical  stability  [263] .  Thanks  to  the  pioneering  works  of  Fen- 
ton et al. in 1973, [405] who suggested ion conductivity in a PEO- 
alkaline metal ion complex, and Armand in 1978 [406] , who used 
PEO  in  batteries  for  the  ﬁrst  time,  polymer  based  ion  conduct- 
ing  materials  have  generated  an  increasing  scientiﬁc  and  indus- 
trial interest in the ﬁeld of LIBs. SPEs are obtained after the dis- 
solution  of  a  lithium  salt  within  a  polymeric  matrix.  In  spite  of 
the  advances  made  on  SPEs,  the  vast  majority  of  SPEs  are  bi- 
ionic  systems  where  both  anions  and  cations  are  mobile,  which 
results in Li-ion transference numbers (LTN) lower than 0.5 [407] . 
To increase the ionic conductivity of traditional dual-ion conduct- 
ing electrolytes, in which both cations and anions are mobile and 
cause polarization concentration, more recently single lithium-ion 
conducting  SPEs  (SLIC-SPEs)  have  been  synthesized  [408] .  They

as  10 −4  S  cm −1  at  30  °C  [419] ,  while  PEO/PAA  blends  present 
increased  ionic  conductivity  by  blocking  the  anion  and  increas- 
ing  the  lithium  transport  number  [420] ,  and  PEO-PAN  copoly- 
mer  complexed  with  LiClO 
4  display  an  ionic  conductivity  of 
6.79 ×10 −4 S cm −1 at 25 °C [421] . Many PEO-LiX based systems in- 
corporating diblock and triblock copolymers have been developed 
so far [422–424] . Interestingly, the combination of the single-ion 
conducting  block  poly(lithium  methacrylate-co-oligoethylene  gly- 
col  methacrylate)  (P(MALi-co-OEGMA))  together  with  a  PS  block 
allows  to  achieve  a  remarkable  ionic  conductivity  at  room  tem- 
perature  of  0.2  × 10 −4  S  cm −1  [424] .  Other  viable  approach  is 
the dispersion of solid plasticizing elements to form hybrid SPEs. 
Homogeneously dispersed reinforcing phases such as TiO 
3 , 
SiO 
3 , called passive ﬁllers as they do not di- 
rectly participate in the conduction process, serve to prevent den- 
drite penetration through the SPE while increasing the ionic con- 
ductivity, to limit undesired matrix crystallization, to increase the 
thermal  stability  and  to  improve  the  mechanical  and  thermal 
properties  of  SPEs.  Other  ﬁllers  such  as  graphene  [425]  or  su- 
per acid oxides [426] are also used in SPEs. Beyond to the inert 
3 , LLTO [427] ; 
ﬁllers, several lithium ﬁllers (such as Li 
Li 
12 , LLZO [428] , among others), have been also used 
as reinforcing elements. Those ﬁllers are identiﬁed as active ﬁllers 
as they contribute to the conduction process.

The  low  electrochemical  stability  of  PEO  does  not  allow  the 
2 and 
use of high energy density cathode materials such as LiCoO 
LiNi 
4  cathodes 
4 ,  limiting  most  of  the  works  to  LiFePO 
[429] .  Additionally,  its  relatively  low  ionic  conductivity  at  room 
temperature does not allow the development of commercial high 
performance LIBs. Therefore, industry and research are making no- 
table efforts in order to upgrade the performance of SPEs. An opti- 
mal SPE should, in principle, comprise a lithium salt having a low 
lattice energy dissolved into a polymer host with a high dielec- 
tric constant to enable the dissociation and prospective transport 
of ions [410] . In this line, salts ensure a maximum ionization, while 
polar polymers are preferred as they can form coordination bonds 
with cations and anions [430] . 

Other strategy for increasing the ionic conductivity rely on low- 
ering the T g value. Accordingly, different methods have been pro- 
posed,  such  as  a  cross-linking  step  via  photopolymerization  of 
poly(ethylene  glycol)  methyl  ether  acrylate  (PEGMEA,  monomer) 
and  poly(ethylene  glycol)  diacrylate  (PEGDA,  cross-linker)  [431] , 
using a cross-linking agent by nano-SiO 
2  [432] , or using bisphe- 
nol  a  ethoxylate  diacrylates  (BPAEDA)  [433] ,  tetra(ethylene  gly- 
col)dimethyl ether (G4) [434] or a copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne 
cycloaddition [435] . 

The incorporation of copper oxide powders within a PEO ma- 
trix resulted in interesting ionic conductivity at room temperature 
(0.1 mS.cm −1 ), although low discharge capacity was obtained upon 
battery assembly (51 mAh.g −1 at C/10) [436] . The effect of differ- 

ent shapes of BaTiO 
3 nanoparticles in a PEO structure doped with 
LiTFSI has also been studied, concluding that nanospheres lead to 
the highest ionic conductivity (1.8 × 10 −5  S.cm −1 ) and discharge 
capacity (135.6 mAh.g −1 at C/10) [437] . 

A double composite membrane consisting on lithium salts and 
SiO 
2  ceramic particles into a PEO/PPO blend was prepared using 
electrospinning. Such membranes showed a promising ionic con- 
ductivity and an excellent discharge capacity, presenting a low and 
stable interface resistance between the separator and the metal an- 
ode [438] . Additionally, a SPE based on PEO and glass ﬁbres effec- 
tively suppresses Li dendrite growth, improving the cycling stabil- 
ity and battery life by an order of magnitude in comparison with 
pure PEO electrolytes [439] . 

Polysiloxanes, also known as silicones, are polymers made up 
of  repeating  units  of  siloxane  (alternating  silicons  and  oxygen 
atoms)  that  are  highly  ﬂexible,  show  good  thermal  and  chem- 
ical  stability  and  tuneable  properties  as  they  can  have  a  wide 
range of substituents bound to the silicon and are added to PEO 
polymer  [440] .  When  polar  units  are  introduced,  the  achieved 
low  T g  values  ( −123  °C  for  poly  (dimethyl  siloxane),  for  exam- 
ple)  and  high  free  volumes  result  very  interesting  for  the  fab- 
rication  of  SPEs  [441] .  For  example,  poly  (dimethyl  siloxane-co- 
ethylene  oxide)  with  5  wt%  LiClO 
4  shows  ionic  conductivities  of 
3.0  × 10 −5  and  2.6  × 10 −4  S  cm −1  at  −30  and  25  °C  respec- 
tively,  which  together  with  the  wide  electrochemical  stability  of 
5.0  V  Li/Li +  make  this  material  useful  for  many  practical  ap- 
plications  [442] .  Further  polysiloxanes  have  been  developed  so 
far  as  SPE  for  LIBs,  which  include  cross-linked  poly  (siloxane-g- 
ethylene oxide)-LiTFSI as a strategy to upgrade the poor mechan- 
ical  stability  of  silicones  at  high  temperatures  (ionic  conductiv- 
ity  at  RT  of  10 −4  S  cm −1 ,  electrochemical  window  above  4.5  V 
Li/Li + ) [443] , cross-linked polysiloxanes with pendant oligo (ethy- 
lene glycol) as plasticizing and doped with LiTFSI (ionic conductiv- 
ity at RT of 1.33 ×10 −4  S cm −1 ) [441] , or a mixture of polysilox- 
ane with PVDF and LiTFSI to improve the mechanical properties 
and electrode compatibility while keeping the ionic conductivity 
at 7.9 × 10 −5 S cm −1 and an electrochemical window up to 5.17 V 
Li/Li + at 25 °C [4 4 4] . 

Polycarbonates: Thanks to its relatively small dielectric constant 
value,  PEO-based  SPEs  do  not  allow  an  effective  dissociation  of 
lithium  salts,  yielding  a  large  amount  of  ion  aggregates  [445] . 
Polycarbonates  emerge  as  a  possible  solution  that  faces  this  is- 
sue  as  it  is  shown  that  the  polar  carbonate  groups  (-O-(C = O)- 
O-) are able to suppress the crystallization ability of the hosting 
matrix  and  are  also  able  to  increase  the  dissociation  of  lithium 
salts [446] . The aliphatic amorphous polyethylene carbonate (PEC) 
mixed with LiFSI has been shown to reduce the coordinate bond- 
ing of polymer chains and lithium ions to yield a conductivity of 
2.2 × 10 −4  S cm −1 , which is increased up to 4.3 × 10 −4  S cm −1 
2 nanoparticles [447] . PEC-

LITFSI SPE displays a lithium ion transference number of 0.4, which 
is 4 times larger than that obtained for PEO-based SPEs [448] . As 
a  result,  a  good  electrochemical  stability  up  to  4.5  V  Li/Li +  and 
ionic  conductivities  as  high  as  4.7  × 10 −4  S  cm −1  can  be  ob- 
tained upon the introduction of 0.2 M of LiTFSI [448] . Poly (vinyl 
carbonate)  (PVCA)  has  been  used  to  develop  SPEs  with  an  elec- 
trochemical window of 4.5 V Li + /KLi and a ionic conductivity of 
9.82 ×10 −5  S  cm −1  at  50  °C  [449] .  Free  standing  poly(propylene

the temperature range of 0–160 °C [450] . Cyclic carbonates such as 
poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) containing LiTFSI with ionic 
conductivity of 10 −7 S cm −1 at high temperatures and good elec- 
trochemical stability up to 5.0 V Li/Li + where synthesized [177] . 
The  biodegradable  character  of  poly  ( ε-caprolactone)  (PCL)  and 
poly (propylene carbonate) (PPC) polycarbonates may be used to 
develop  biodegradable  batteries.  Recent  works  have  shown  good 
electrochemical stabilities, high ion transference numbers, good in- 
terfacial compatibility, high Coulombic eﬃciency, extended cycle- 
life and ionic conductivities in the range of 10 −4 S cm −1 for SPEs 
based on PCL and PPC [ 451 , 452 ]. 

CO 

2 -sourced  polycarbonates  are  interesting  candidates  to  be 
used  as  raw  materials  for  SPEs.  Polymer  electrolytes  contain- 
ing no solvent can be fabricated by simple UV cross-linking ap- 
proach, displaying an ionic conductivity up to 3.75 • 10 −5  S cm −1 
when  loaded  with  30  wt%  LiTFSI  [453] .  A  SPE  based  on  a 
poly(ethylene  oxide  carbonate)  copolymer  having  PEO  segments 
linked  by  carbonate  groups  with  cross-linkable  methacrylic  pen- 
dant groups showed improved ionic conductivity and mechanical 
stability in comparison with bare polycarbonates. A maximum of 
3.2 • 10 −5 S cm −1 with a lithium transference number of 0.59 was 
obtained  at  30  wt%  LiTFSI  [454] .  When  compared  to  analogous 
conventional  salt  in  polymer  electrolytes  containing  equal  molar 
lithium cation and free TFSI anions, poly(ethylene oxide carbonate) 
copolymer  electrolytes  present  an  improved  performance  during 
lithium plating and stripping steps [455] . Moveover, the introduc- 
tion of cyclic carbonate linkages within a polycarbonate/polyether 
backbone loaded with LiTFSI has been proven as a successful strat- 
egy  to  surpass  by  up  to  150%  the  ionic  conductivity  of  polymer 
electrolytes containing linear carbonate linkages [456] . 

Other common synthetic polymers used for SPE development: Its 
amorphous  character  and  polar  functional  groups  that  present  a 
high aﬃnity for Li ions and plasticizing solvents make PMMA an 
interesting  candidate  to  develop  SPEs.  For  example,  it  has  been 
shown  that  PMMA  with  LiTFSI  and  4.wt%  of  silica  nanoparticles 
prepared  by  solution  casting  showed  a  maximum  ionic  conduc- 
tivity  of  2.44 ×10 −6  S  cm −1  at  room  temperature  [245] .  Thanks 
to  its  good  compatibility  with  other  polymers,  PMMA  has  been 
blended with different counterparts to obtain solid electrolytes for 
4  and EC 
LIBs. SPEs comprising PVA and PMMA blends with LiBF 
have  been  prepared  by  solvent-casting  to  obtain  materials  with 
a maximum ionic conductivity of 1.29 ×10 −3  S cm −1  at a 8 wt% 
4 [457] . Similarly, PVDF-HFP/PMMA blends plasticized with the 
LiBF 
BMIPF 
6 ionic liquid showed an electrochemical window of 4.43 V 
Li-/Li and a remarkable ionic conductivity of 0.45 ×10 −3 S cm −1 at 
25 °C and 1.73 × 10 −3 S cm −1 at 75 °C, approaching to that of liq- 
uid electrolyte [458] . 

The incorporation of LLZN nanowires into a PMMA/LiClO 

4 ma- 
trix  promoted  the  decrease  of  the  polymer  crystallinity,  signiﬁ- 
cantly improving the ionic conductivity and allowing the battery 
operation  in  the  range  of  60–70  °C  [459] .  Considering  the  large 
amorphous fraction of PVDF-HFP, it is being used in SPE applica- 
tions, where thanks to the active lithium ion conductor character 
of LLZTO, its addition leads to an increase in ionic conductivity up 
to 8.80 ×10 −5 S.cm −1 [460] . 

Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) has been used as a host polymer of 
polymer electrolytes, either by directly incorporating lithium salts 
or by forming polymer blends with PMMA and incorporating then 
different  lithium  salts  [ 457 , 461 ].  Similarly,  PAN-based  polymer 
electrolytes have been intensively studied upon the addition of dif- 
ferent lithium salts such as LiTFSI [462] , LiClO 
4 [463] , or a liquid- 
plasticizer-containing  gel  type  [ 464 , 465 ].  It  is  observed  that  the 
addition of butadiene [466] and nitrile [467] monomers into PAN 
increases the lithium solvation when salts such as LiTFSI, LiAsF 
6 , 
LiCF 
4 are incorporated. Indeed, these monomers im- 
prove the Li transport number [466] .

Plastic crystals: P lastic crystal electrolytes are plastic crystalline 
substances, i.e., solutions of lithium-containing salts incorporated 
into plastic crystals that are able to melt above a certain temper- 
ature.  A  fast  Li +  transport  is  achieved  thanks  to  their  rotational 
disorder and the presence of vacancies in their lattice [468] . The 
mechanical malleability of plastic crystals allows their use as SPEs 
for ﬂexible batteries. Solid state electrolytes based on plastic crys- 
talline solvents were prepared and it was proven that SPEs con- 
taining plastic crystals and lithium salts show unusual room tem- 
perature ionic conductivities and thermal stabilities [469] . An ex- 
ample  of  plastic  crystals  are  nitrile  materials,  which  apart  from 
presenting high diffusivity values in the −40 to + 60 °C tempera- 
ture range, also display excellent electrochemical stability and ther- 
momechanical properties [470] . Li ions interact favourably with ni- 
trile  groups  (-C ≡N),  contributing  to  enhance  the  resulting  ionic 
conductivity.  Among  all  nitrile  materials,  the  highly  polar  succi- 
nonitrile  (SN)  is  one  of  the  most  interesting  candidates  to  de- 
velop SPEs as it shows a single plastic-crystalline phase in the tem- 
perature  range  of  −35  to  + 62  °C  [471] .  Further,  after  dissolving 
5 wt% of LiTFSI within a plastic-crystal form of SN, a remarkable 
ionic conductivity up to 3 × 10 −3  S cm −1  is obtained [472] . Un- 
fortunately, these developed materials could not be used as self- 
standing ﬁlms. As a strategy to upgrade such issue, a SPE consist- 
ing on SN-LiTFSi reinforced with UV-cured ETPTA macromer/Al 
2 O 
3 
nanoparticles yielded mechanically robust and self-standing mate- 
rials with stable cycling performance [473] . More recently, a hierar- 
chical SPE based on nitrile was developed by in situ polymerizing 
the cyanoethyl polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-CN) in succinonitrile (SN)- 
based solid electrolyte ﬁlled in the network of PAN-based electro- 
spun ﬁber membrane. Good mechanical stability and ﬂexibility to- 
gether with a remarkable room temperature ionic conductivity up 
to  2.32 ×10 −3  S  cm −1  and  a  lithium  ion  transference  number  of 
0.57 were achieved [470] . 

Cellulose derivatives: The high crystallinity of natural polymers 
has  limited  their  potential  as  SPEs  because  the  ion  conduction 
is restricted by crystalline domains. An effective approach to in- 
crease  the  room  temperature  ionic  conductivity  of  biopolymers 
is the concomitant reduction of their crystallinity by incorporat- 
ing plasticizing agents together with the introduction of suitable 
chemical  moieties  that  provide  free  mobile  ions.  Accordingly,  it 
has  been  shown  that  the  incorporation  of  Ionic  Liquids  (a  mix- 
ture  of  LiTFSI  and  deep  eutectic  solvent  (DES)  with  CA  or  1- 
allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) into cellulose acetate (CA) in- 
creases  the  ionic  conductivity  of  CA  by  six  order  of  magnitude, 
up to 2.61 ×10 −3  S cm −1  while retaining its mechanical integrity 
over the storage time [ 474 , 475 ]. The used ILs show a high mobil- 
ity of carrier ions, which are able to break the extensive hydro- 
gen  bonding  network  and  allows  the  polar  oxygen  atom  in  the 
CA to form coordination with the free mobile ions [476] . The in- 
crease in ionic conductivity was ascribed to the strong hydrogen 
bond-forming abilities of CA, which after plasticization increases 
the structural disorder to show an enhancement in free conduct- 
ing ion transport as observed through the shifting of loss tangent 
peaks toward higher frequencies in impedance spectroscopy mea- 
surements. Glycerol has been proven to be an effective plasticiz-

ing agent for cellulose and its derivatives, as it also results in ma- 
terials  with  remarkable  ﬁlm-forming  and  adherent  properties  to 
glass  and  steel  surfaces,  which  may  help  towards  achieving  sta- 
ble electrolyte–electrode interfaces [477] . Accordingly, SPEs based 
on hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) with lithium triﬂuoromethane sul- 
fonate (LiCF 
3 ) salt and different amounts of glycerol as plas- 
ticizer  have  been  developed.  As  a  consequence  of  the  exten- 
sive  solvation  of  HEC,  maximum  ionic  conductivity  values  up  to 
1.07 × 10 −5 S cm −1 and 1.06 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at 30 and 83 °C re- 
spectively were obtained for samples containing lithium salt con- 
centration of [O]/[Li] = 6. The effect of molecular interactions on 
the resulting ionic conductivity of a SPE composed by cellulose ph- 
4 [478] has been analyzed. CP was obtained 
thalate (CP) and LiClO 
after the substitution of –OH groups of the cellulose with phthalic 
anhydride and the maximum ionic conductivity was obtained at 
intermediate Li + cation concentration. This effect was explained by 
the fact that at low concentrations Li + coordinates with carbonyl 
and ether groups and also forms ionic bonds with carboxyl groups 
of CP, while only ionic bonds are obtained at high concentrations. 
Cellulose and its derivatives offer a plethora of novel opportu- 
nities to develop SPEs for LIBs. Accordingly, other SPEs based on 
cellulose  include  those  formed  by  cellulose  triacetate  (CTA)  and 
lithium salts [479] , oligo(ethylene oxide) grafted hydroxypropylcel- 
lulose (HPC) (ionic conductivity of 2.5 × 10 −4 S cm −1 and proper 
mechanical  stability  at  temperatures  up  to  100  °C)  [480] .  Cellu- 
lose in the form of microﬁbrils and whiskers can be used to re- 
inforce PEO-LiTFSI [481] . A remarkable increase in mechanical sta- 
bility was found at temperatures above the melting temperature 
of  PEO  (65  °C)  as  the  percolated  network  with  strong  hydrogen 
bonds  formed  by  cellulosic  ﬁllers  is  able  to  hold  the  PEO-LiTFSI 
matrix. It was found that although sisal-whisker reinforced coun- 
terpart showed a slight ionic conductivity decrease at 60 °C from 
4 × 10 −4 S cm −1 for PEO–LiTFSI to 3.1 × 10 −4 S cm −1 , the pres- 
ence of microﬁbirls decreases the ionic conduction by a factor of 3 
as a result of the more restricted PEO mobility due to the addition 
of long and entangled ﬁbrils. 

Single lithium-ion conducting SPEs: Contrarily to traditional SPEs, 
which  are  dual-ion  conductors  where  both  Li +  cations  and  its 
counter  anions  are  mobile,  single  lithium-ion  conducting  SPEs 
(SLIC-SPEs) have immobilized anions, offering a very relevant ad- 
vantages for LIBs such as high lithium ion transference numbers, 
low rate of dendrite growth as indicated by Chazalviel model and 
absence  of  anion  polarization  effects  [408] .  Bannister  et  al.  pro- 
posed in 1984 two methods to obtain SLIC-SPEs; the anion can be 
chemically attached to a polymer side chain or the mobility of the 
anion is suppressed using a lithium salt of a dibasic acid such as 
dilithium hexaﬂuoroglutarate which acts as a trapping agents for 
anions [482] . In both cases, only Li + cation will contribute to a per- 
manent ﬂow of charge. Many polymer based SLIC-SPEs show car-

as a counterpart of the Li + cation. While carboxylate anions were 
ﬁrstly developed in the 1980s, sulfonate anions were introduced 
in the 1990s as an attempt to obtain SLIC-SPEs with higher ionic 
− has a higher degree of negative charge de- 
conductivities, as -SO

localization. SLIC-SPEs comprising sulfonylimide anions have been 
later developed to improve the performance of solid polymer elec- 
trolytes. More recently, boron and phosphorous have been used as 
center atoms to develop SLIC-SPEs [ 210 , 483 ]. Regarding the elec- 
trochemical performance of SLIC-SPEs, it is interesting to note that 
single-ion BAB triblock copolymers based on PEO (LiPSTFSI-b-PEO- 
b-LiPSTFSI) are highly eﬃcient solid electrolyte for lithium-metal 
batteries. A lithium-ion transport number close to 1, excellent me- 
chanical properties, no capacity fade when working at 60–80 °C 
temperature range and a good electrochemical stability pp to 5 V 
versus Li + /Li were obtained, outperforming a conventional battery 
based on traditional SPEs [484] . The remarkable capacity retention 

obtained by SLIC-SPEs, ascribed to the prevention of concentration 
gradients and dendrite formation, which is a characteristic feature 
of dual-ion conducting SPEs, results a strong proof-of-concept for 
the advantages of such materials for the next generation LIBs. In 
any  case,  the  low  ionic  conductivities  obtained  so  far  for  many 
SLIC-SPEs in comparison with traditional SPEs such as those based 
on PEO is a matter that needs to be solved. In this line, it is be- 
lieved that rather than any speciﬁc polymer + matrix, anions with 
super delocalized negative charge distribution are required in or- 
der to obtain highly conductive SLIC-SPEs. 

3 ) 

A gel-type ﬂuorinated polysulfonylamide-based single ion con- 
ducting polymer electrolyte blended with PVDF-HFP showed a high 
ionic conductivity of 0.52 mS cm −1 and a lithium ion transference 
number of 0.9, where the presence of -C(CF 
2  functional groups 
play a pivotal role during the lithiation process [485] . When mixed 
with bis(4-carbonyl benzene sulfonyl)imide) (LiPSI), an electrospun 
PVDF-HFP mat (0.68 mS • cm −1 ) showed an excellent long cycle life 
performance while facing the poor thermal stability and moisture 
sensitivity of LiPF 
6 salt, at the same time that suppresses lithium 
dendrite growth [486] . 

Naﬁon TM  is  among  the  best-known  ion  conducting  polymers 
and can be found commercialized by DuPont Co. (Wilmington, DE, 
USA). Naﬁon TM has a polytetraﬂuoroethylene backbone and a per- 
ﬂuorovinylether side chain where sulfonic acid groups ( −SO 
3 H) are 
covalently immobilized, which provides a high ionic conductivity 
and  good  thermal,  chemical  and  mechanical  stability  [487] .  This 
ionomer is extremely resistant to chemical attack and is thermally 
stable up to 160 °C. Although it is primarily used as an ion ex- 
change membrane in the chlorine– caustic soda industries thanks 
to its good stability and high proton conductivity [ 4 88 , 4 89 ], this 
perﬂuorosulfonic acid emerges as an alternative SPE material with 
good  performance.  It  can  be  purchased  in  H +  form  (H –Naﬁon) 
with different thicknesses (25–100 μm). It is usually referred to 
its protonated form, but this proton can be ion-exchanged to Li or 
Na ions to increase its ionic conductivity (it is easily lithiated in a 
Li + containing electrolyte) [ 4 87 , 4 90 ]. After ion exchange of H + to 
Li + , the lithiated Naﬁon (Li-Naﬁon) soaked in PC displays a remark- 
able room temperature ionic conductivity of 8.18 × 10 −5  S cm −1 
[491] ,  which  is  larger  than  that  of  many  single-ion  conducting 
polymer electrolytes [417] . Indeed, the Li +  transport number can 
reach  almost  the  unity  after  using  Li-Naﬁon TM  and  codissolving 
it  with  copolymer  poly-(vinylidene  ﬂuoride)-hexaﬂuoropropylene 
[409] . The ﬂexibility and light weight of lithiated Naﬁon TM mem- 
brane swollen in PC has been used as SPE, which offers an ionic 
conductivity  of  2.1  × 10 −4  S  cm −1  at  70  °C,  an  electrochemical 
window of 0 to + 4.1 V vs. Li/Li + and a Li-ion transference num- 
ber is 0.928 [250] . Similarly, Li-Naﬁon TM membranes were used as 
SPE in Li-ion cells using LiFePO 
4 as cathode and Li as anode, where 
the cell displayed a reversible speciﬁc capacity of 126.6 mAh g −1 
at 60 °C [492] . It has been also shown that the use of Li-Naﬁon TM 
as both separator and electrolyte prevents the dissolution of Mn 2 + 
from the LiMn 
4 cathode as there is no HF generation from the 
LiPF 

6 salt dissolved in the organic liquid electrolyte [493] . 
Following  a  poly(ionic  liquid)-in-salt  approach,  a  strategy  to- 
wards  obtaining  safer  batteries  was  reported,  where  a  liquid- 
free  SPE  was  obtained  using  poly(diallyldimethylammonium) 
bis(ﬂuorosulfonyl)imide (PDADMA FSI) with a high LiFSI salt con- 
tent. Thanks to the co-coordination of the FSI anion with both the 
Li +  and the polymer backbone, a Li +  ion transference number of 
0.56 was obtained, providing a long-term stable Li-metal symmet- 
rical cycling [494] .

Solid  polymer  electrolytes  are  likely  to  become  an  essential 
component  for  the  next  generation  of  solid-state  batteries.  Such 
polymers must display a high ionic conductivity, an excellent elec- 
trochemical stability window and enough mechanical and thermal 
stability. Each polymer type has advantages and disadvantages and,

at  the  moment,  the  most  widely  used  candidate  for  solid  elec- 
trolytes is PEO. Currently, there is a trend towards the use of nat- 
ural polymers, but these still show low ionic conductivity, which 
represents the major limitation for their implementation in actual 
battery systems. The future trends in solid polymer electrolytes in- 
clude increasing the ionic conductivity values at room temperature, 
reducing the contact resistance solid polymer electrolyte/electrodes 
(anode  and  cathode)  and  improving  the  electrochemical 
windows. 

4. Conclusions and future perspectives 

Polymeric materials have become essential components in elec- 
trodes  and  separator  /  electrolyte  systems  of  high-performance 
lithium-ion batteries. Regarding the electrodes, the polymer binder 
plays an important role in maintaining the mechanical and struc- 
tural  integrity,  improving  adhesion  to  the  current  collector,  and 
binding together the active material and conductive additive. Sev- 
eral  types  of  polymers  are  currently  being  applied  as  polymer 
binders, where the most commonly used ones are PVDF and CMC. 
PVDF  is the  dominant binder so  far  in the battery  industry  due 
to its high electrochemical stability, excellent mechanical proper- 
ties, thermal stability, good interaction with the electrolyte solu- 
tion and its proven ability to allow the transport of Li + . The main 
disadvantages of using PVDF are the use of toxic solvents during its 
processing and the typically low adhesion/cohesion to the current 
collector. 

Most of the effort s regarding polymer binder are focusing on 
the improvement of the adhesion/cohesion to current collector and 
in  the  development  of  binders  that  successfully  cover  essential 
characteristics such as enhanced mechanical, electrical, and elec- 
trochemical  performance.  The  search  for  binders  having  a  high 
conductivity  is  emerging  as  a  suitable  strategy  to  eliminate  the 
need of a conductive additive to the electrodes. Moreover, it be- 
comes essential to design new environmentally friendlier binders 
that remain easily recyclable. Providing additional functions such 
as  stretchability,  self-healing  properties  and  low  resistance  may 
yield to improved rate capability and cycle life of LIBs. 

Regarding  the  separator  membranes,  their  main  function 
is  to  provide  a  medium  to  effectively  transfer  ions  between 
the  electrodes,  preventing  electrical  contact  between  the  anode 
and  the  cathode,  regulating  cell  kinetics  and  ensuring  a  safe 
charge/discharge  process.  The  most  used  materials  for  separator 
membranes  are  polyoleﬁns  and  PVDF-based  polymers.  Commer- 
cially  available  separators  based  on  polyoleﬁns  show  low  ther- 
mal and mechanical stability, are highly inﬂammable and have low 
wettability. On the contrary, PVDF has excellent mechanical prop- 
erties,  good  thermal  stability  and  can  allow  the  control  of  mor- 
phology through the binary and ternary polymer/solvent systems. 
The  future  trends  in  this  ﬁeld  include  the  use  of  natural  poly- 
mers  with  proper  control  over  the  microstructure  (large  porosi- 
ties of 80% and small pore sizes below 1 μm), good mechanical 
performance, suﬃcient thermal stability, an obtaining an increased 
compatibility with electrodes. These new separators should be pro- 
duced using scalable and safe methods, where ﬁllers of different 
nature can be incorporated in order to upgrade ionic conductiv- 
ity  values.  Solid  polymer  electrolytes  are  essential  for  the  next 
generation of solid-state batteries as they may improve the safety 
of the LIBs, where PEO results the most used material. Unfortu- 
nately, the ionic conductivity at room temperature of solid elec- 
trolytes still remains below the desired level, limiting their use in 
commercial  LIBs.  In this  sense,  diverse polysaccharides  including 
cellulose derivatives and carrageenan show interesting characteris- 
tics to develop solid polymer electrolytes as their inherently amor- 
phous character facilitates lithium salt incorporation into the solid 
structure. 

Although generally speaking LIBs are safe, with millions of con- 
sumers using energy-storage devices based on lithium, failures are 
bound to happen. In this sense, battery safety is one of the most 
relevant issues that need to be overcome in the near future in or- 
der to allow the use of LIBs in electric cars. Different approaches 
have been carried out so far for the effective suppression of lithium 
dendrite growth in LIBs using polymeric separators, where future 
works will address the use of coatings to improve electrochemical 
stability and safety. 

The use of water-processable biosourced polymers also should 
be  taken  into  account.  In  this  framework,  cellulose  and  their 
derivatives emerge as potential materials for the development of 
sustainable all solid-state LIBs as they provide the opportunity to 
use  papermaking  processes  during  their  fabrication,  offering  an 
easy,  eﬃcient,  cost-effective  scale-up  method.  The  fabrication  of 
SPEs could boost the development of novel strategies towards the 
improvement of conventional LIBs. Besides of the associated safety 
increase,  SPEs  with  high  Li +  conductivity  could  help  in  the  de- 
sign of novel batteries consisting on lithium anode and a liquid or 
gaseous cathode reactant. Such conﬁguration may help to increase 
cell voltage at the same time that both anode and cathode capac- 
ity is increased. Similarly, the ﬁeld of ﬂexible LIBs offers a plethora 
of novel opportunities, where the use of solid electrolytes is a hot 
research topic. 

Overall, this review demonstrates the relevant role of polymeric 
materials for different components in LIBs, where further research 
effort s are needed in order to boost their performance. Obtaining 
low-cost, safer, longer lasting and sustainable LIBs will certainly re- 
main among the key objectives in the research on energy storage 
materials and devices.
