This paper reviews the current status of biodiesel production mainly under supercritical conditions. Various
methods such as homogeneous acid- and alkali-catalyzed transesterification, heterogeneous acid and
alkali-catalyzed transesterification, enzyme-catalyzed transesterification, and supercritical reactions have
been employed so far to synthesize biodiesel. Herein, we review the reaction mechanisms and experimental
results for these approaches. Recently, supercritical biodiesel production has undergone a vigorous develop-
ment as the technology offers several advantages over other methods, including the fact that it does not
require a catalyst, short residence time, high reaction rate, no pretreatment requirement, and applicability
to a wide variety of feedstock. This technology was first designed for biodiesel production using methanol
and ethanol. Biodiesel production without glycerol as a byproduct is attractive and has been achieved using
supercritical methyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Most recently, biodiesel production in super-
critical tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) has been developed also. In this review, supercritical biodiesel pro-
duction will be discussed in detail. Empirical rate expressions are derived for biodiesel production in
supercritical methanol, ethanol, methyl acetate, DMC, and MTBE in this study for the first time. These rate
equations are critical to predicting biodiesel yields and to comparing the reaction behaviors in different sol-
vents. Lastly challenges for improving energy recovery in supercritical biodiesel production and recommen-
dations for future work are provided.

1. Introduction

2. Biodiesel production processes

PResearch on renewable energy has attracted a tremendous atten-
tion because of the challenges due to global climate change and
environmental pollution problems associated with fossil fuel com-
bustion. One of the most notable forms of renewable energy is bio-
diesel, which can be derived from the biomass including vegetable
oil, animal fats, and microalgae. Biodiesel exhibits favorable biode-
gradability [1] and has lower particulate matter and CO emissions
[2, 3, 4, 5], lower sulfur contents [6], and higher cetane numbers [7]
than conventional diesel fuel.

PIn 1893, Rudolph Diesel operated his engines using vegetable
oil (peanut oil) because petroleum was not available at that time.
The direct application of vegetable oil was however problematic
due to its high viscosity. Techniques are available to reduce the
viscosity of vegetable oil, including dilution [8], microemulsion
[9], pyrolysis [10], and transesterification [11]. In the dilution
method, a vegetable oil is mixed with or diluted by a diesel fuel.
It was reported in 1980 that Caterpillar Brazil Co. used a 10 vol%
mixture of vegetable oil in diesel fuel to maintain total power
without any adjustment to the engine [12]. A blend of 20% (vol)
vegetable oil and 80% (vol) diesel fuel was also successfully used
[12]. Another approach to reducing the viscosity of is microemul-
sion, in which butanol, hexanol, and octanol are usually used as
solvents [13]. Pyrolysis of vegetable oil has also been employed at
elevated temperatures in the presence of a catalyst for viscosity
reduction. Schwab et al. [8] found that even though the viscosity
of the pyrolyzed soybean oil (10.2 mm2/s at 37.8 °C) was higher
than that of the ASTM specification range for diesel fuel, it was
still acceptable for use in engines.

PAll methods just discussed are associated with problems due to
carbon deposition and contamination. Transesterification is known
to be the best technique for production of biodiesel due to its physi-
cal and chemical similarity with conventional diesel fuel. The pro-
cess produces little or no deposits. Various transesterification
processes are summarized in Fig. 1, each having its own advantages
and disadvantages. Among them, supercritical biodiesel production
is a promising route as it offers unique advantages over other meth-
ods, including the fact that it does require a catalyst and has a
shorter reaction time. Supercritical biodiesel production can be
applied to a wide variety of feedstock. No feedstock pretreatment is
necessary, and separation and purification of products are relatively
easy. As shown in Fig. 1, supercritical biodiesel production can use a
variety of solvents ranging from methanol, ethanol, methyl acetate,
dimethyl carbonate (DMC), or tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE).

PThis review aims to provide a review on the latest advances in
supercritical biodiesel production and a better understanding of the
chemical processes by examining at a detailed level the mecha-
nisms of triglycerides reactions with methanol, ethanol, methyl
acetate, DMC, and MTBE. Empirical rate expressions are derived for
reactions in these solvents for the first time. These rate equations
are critical to predicting the product yield and to unraveling the
reaction behaviors. Factors affecting supercritical biodiesel produc-
tion are discussed in detail, including temperature, residence time,
pressure, and oil-to-reactant molar ratio. Finally, the challenge for
improving energy recovery and recommendations for future work
are presented.

PBiodiesel is mainly produced by reacting triglycerides with short-
chain alcohols such as methanol and ethanol in a transesterification
process (Fig. 1). These methods, along with their advantages and
drawbacks, are discussed in what follows.

2.1. Homogeneous catalysts

PTwo types of homogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production are

homogeneous acid catalysts and homogeneous alkali catalysts.

P2.1.1. Homogeneous acid-catalyzed transesterification

PSo far, hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) have
been the most commonly used catalysts for acid-catalyzed transes-
terification. Compared with an alkali-catalyzed process, the acid cat-
alyst holds the advantages that it can catalyze esterification and
transesterification simultaneously [14], that it is not sensitive to the
presence of free fatty acid (FFAs) in the feedstock, and that it can be
applied to low-cost lipid feedstock such as waste cooking oil [15].
Zhang et al. [16] reported that acid catalysis performed better when
the amount of FFAs in the feedstock was greater than 1 wt%.

PFig. 2 shows the mechanism of homogeneous acid-catalyzed trans-
esterification for biodiesel production using methanol. This mecha-
nism involves the protonation of the carbonyl group, nucleophilic
attack of methanol to produce a tetrahedral intermediate, followed
by proton migration and intermediate breakdown. This sequence is
repeated two more times to generate biodiesel and glycerol.

PEven though the acid catalyst is insensitive to the presence of
it requires more severe reaction conditions than alkali-

FFAs,

Pcatalyzed transesterification, making it not suitable for industrial
applications. Additionally, this process requires a high reaction tem-
perature and high oil-to-alcohol ratio, takes a long time due to slow
reaction rate, and can cause an environmental problem due to corro-
sion [14, 17]. Previous studies have shown that more that 90% con-
version of waste cooking oil was achieved after 10 h reaction time,
with addition of 4 wt% H2SO4 and using an oil-to-methanol molar
ratio of 1:20 [18]. Freedman et al. [11] also investigated biodiesel
production using H2SO4-catalyzed transesterification. They observed
99% oil conversion within 69 h reaction time with 1 mol% catalyst
and an oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:30. These studies suggest
that acid-catalyzed transesterification requires rather severe reac-
tion conditions.

P2.1.2. Homogeneous alkali-catalyzed transesterification

PToday, biodiesel

is generally produced using homogeneous
alkali-catalyzed transesterification for several reasons. The catalyst
is widely available; the transesterification process is performed

Punder mild reaction conditions (low reaction temperature and under
atmospheric pressure); and high conversion can be achieved in time
shorter than acid catalysis [19,20]. The most commonly used catalyst
is sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH)
[21,22]. Fukuda et al. [19] demonstrated that the homogeneous
alkali-catalyzed transesterification reaction rate was 4000 times
faster than that of acid-catalyzed transesterification under compara-
ble conditions. The drawback of alkali-catalyzed transesterification
is its sensitivity to the presence of FFAs in the feedstock. Ma and
Hanna [23] concluded that the FFA content in vegetable oil must be
less than 1 wt% for alkali-catalyzed transesterification. When the
feedstock contains a large amount of FFA, saponification occurs as
the result of an undesirable reaction between FFA and the alkali cat-
alyst, as shown in Fig. 3, which deactivates the catalyst. The soap can
also inhibit biodiesel purification of and reduce biodiesel yield
[15,24].

PAnother shortcoming of the alkali-catalyzed transesterification
process is its sensitivity to the presence of water which can

Phydrolyze triglycerides to form diglycerides and FFA as shown in
Fig. 4. In industrial processes, the FFA and water content in the feed-
stock must be strictly controlled in order to obtain high-quality bio-
diesel.

PFig. 5 depicts the mechanism of homogeneous alkali-catalyzed
transesterification process for biodiesel production using methanol.
This mechanism involves the production of methoxide, the nucleo-
philic attack of methoxide to carbonyl group on triglycerides to form
a tetrahedral intermediate, followed by intermediate breakdown
and catalyst regeneration. The sequence is repeated two more times
to produce biodiesel and glycerol.

2.2. Heterogeneous catalysts

PSimilar to homogeneous catalysis, transesterification using het-
erogeneous catalysts also has two types, namely heterogeneous

Pacid-catalyzed transesterification and heterogeneous alkali-cata-
lyzed transesterification. Heterogeneous transesterification has
some advantages over homogeneous transesterification. It is easy to
separate the product from catalyst. The catalyst is reusable and there
is no occurrence of saponification. Heterogeneous catalysts are also
more environmentally friendly than homogeneous catalysts and can
be used in batch or continuous-flow reactors [25,26].

P2.2.1. Heterogeneous acid-catalyzed transesterification

PHeterogeneous acid-catalyzed transesterification has a lower
activity. Nonetheless, this method has been applied in industrial pro-
cesses because of its ability to catalyze esterification and transesteri-
fication processes simultaneously, low toxicity, less corrosiveness
than homogeneous acid catalysts, insensitivity to the FFA content,
elimination of the washing step of biodiesel, presence of a variety
of acid sites with different Bronsted or Lewis acid strengths, easy

Pseparation of the catalyst from the reaction medium, low product
contaminant, and easy regeneration and recycling of the catalyst
[15,27,28]. However, slow reaction rates and the occurrence of
undesirable side reactions are some of its drawbacks.

PAcid catalysts utilized include zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), tin
dioxide (SnO2), titanium dioxide (TiO2), zeolites, and sulfonic ion-
exchange resins including Amberlyst-15, Amberlyst-35, and Nafion-
NR50. Among them, Nafion-NR50 exhibited a high selectivity for
production of biodiesel and glycerol because of its acid strength
[29]. The limitation is its high cost and lower activity compared to
liquid acid catalysts [30].

PZrO2 was used as heterogeneous acid catalyst due to its strong
surface acidity. This catalyst is commonly used after impregnation
in an acidic solution such as H2SO4 to form sulfated zirconia,
SO4
(cid:1)ZrO2 [31] or together with alumina (Al2O3) to form ZrO2-
(cid:1)Al2O3 or even with tungsten trioxide (WO3). The activity is

different with or without impregnation.
when ZrO2 was used after impregnating with H2SO4, the yield of
biodiesel from palm kernel oil and crude coconut oil was as high as
90.3% and 86.3%, respectively. Without impregnation, however, the
yields drop to 64.5% and 49.3%, respectively [27]. Thus, modification
of the metal oxide surface acidity was deduced as the key to obtain-
ing high yields. Further, Jacobson et al. [14] demonstrated that com-
bination of
this catalyst with alumina and tungsten trioxide
(ZrO2(cid:1)Al2O3(cid:1)WO3) could enhance its mechanical strength and
acidity.

PFig. 6 shows a proposed reaction mechanism of SiO2/ZrO2-cata-
lyzed transesterification using methanol. Initially, a carbonyl oxygen
from triglyceride attacks zirconium to produce a reaction intermedi-
ate. The intermediate is then attacked by methanol, forming a new
C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond. The rearrangement in the intermediate produces biodie-
sel and regenerates the catalyst.

PSnO2 also has been used as a heterogeneous acid catalyst for bio-
diesel production. Studies are limited because of complications in
catalyst preparation [32,33]. Similarly to ZrO2, SnO2 is impregnated
also with a strong acid such as H2SO4 to form SO4
(cid:1)SnO2. Furuta
2¡
et al. [34] deduced that the acid strength of SO4
(cid:1)SnO2 is higher
(cid:1)ZrO2. Thus, for the esterification of n-octanoic
than that of SO4
acid with methanol below 150 °C, it was observed that SO4
(cid:1)SnO2
2¡
has a better activity than SO4

(cid:1)ZrO2.

2¡/TiO2 and SO4

PAnother heterogeneous acid catalyst used for biodiesel produc-
tion is TiO2. Even though studies regarding utilization of this catalyst
for biodiesel production are few, this metal oxide catalyst has attrac-
tive acidic properties. Chen et al. [35] reported that biodiesel yields
2¡/ZrO2
from transesterification of cotton oil in SO4
was proportional to the specific surface area of the catalyst and bio-
diesel yields of 90% and 85% were obtained with SO4
(cid:1)TiO2 at a
specific surface area of 99.5 m2/g and SO4
(cid:1)ZrO2 at 91.5 m2/g,
respectively. Shortcomings of this catalyst include the use of fairly
severe reaction conditions (high reaction temperature of 230 °C). de
Almaeda et al. [36] found that a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield
of 40% was obtained after transesterification for 1 h at 120 °C using
SO4
(cid:1)TiO2. In another study, Peng et al. [37] found that the activity

of SO4
(cid:1)TiO2 catalyst could be enhanced by introducing a second-
2¡
ary metal oxide, SiO2 to generate SO4
(cid:1)TiO2(cid:1)SiO2, which led to an
increase in the specific surface area 258 m2/g. Optimum yield of bio-
diesel (90%) was achieved at 200 °C, with catalyst loading of 3 wt%,
oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:9, and 3 h reaction time.

PZeolites have also been used as heterogeneous acid catalysts. The
advantages of zeolites are that the catalysts can be obtained from
natural sources; they are inexpensive; and their acid strength can be
controlled by modifying the aluminosilicate framework. However,
such catalysts have a low activity for transesterification due to steric
triglycerides into the
hindrance that

limits the diffusion of

Pmicroporous structure [38]. Using zeolite Y75, Brito et al. [39] dem-
onstrated a biodiesel yield of 26.6% from waste cooking oil at a tem-
perature as high as 460 °C, 22 min reaction time, and an oil-to-
methanol ratio of 1:6. Kusuma et al. [40] showed that KOH could be
added to enhance the activity of zeolites. In their study the highest
yield of biodiesel (95%) was obtained at 60 °C, using a purified natu-
ral zeolite impregnated with 100 g/100 mL KOH, a palm oil-to-meth-
anol molar ratio of 1:7, 3 wt% catalyst, and 2 h reaction time. They
also proposed a reaction mechanism (Fig. 7), which is almost the
same as that of homogeneous alkali-catalyzed transesterification.
Initially, the reaction between an active catalyst (K2O) site and meth-
anol generates methoxide anion (CH3O¡). CH3O¡ then attacks the
carbonyl carbon in triglyceride forming a tetrahedral intermediate,
which rearranges to produce diglyceride anion and biodiesel. The
formation of diglyceride is due to the reaction between H+ and
diglyceride anion. It is possible that diglyceride anion also reacts
with methanol to produce diglyceride and methoxide anion.

PSulfonic ion-exchange resins and sulfonic modified mesostruc-
tured silica have also been utilized for biodiesel production.

PAmberlyst-15, Amberlyst-35, Amberlyst-15 DRY, and Nafion SAC-13
are common types of sulfonic ion-exchange [41,42]. The advantage
is its excellent catalytic activity for esterification. The shortcomings
include (1) low performance of the catalyst in transesterification, (2)
the requirement of a very high oil-to-alcohol molar ratio, (3) low
thermal stability of the catalyst, as it becomes unstable above 140 °
C, and (4) high reaction temperatures (150(cid:1)200 °C) [20].

PVicente et al. [43] reported that a FAME yield of only 0.7% was
obtained using Amberlyst-15 at atmospheric pressure and an oil-to-
methanol molar ratio of 1:6 after 8 h reaction time. Dos Reis et al.
[44] illustrated that to increase the biodiesel yield, the oil-to-metha-
nol molar ratio should be increased. A yield of 80% was achieved at
60 °C and an oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:100 after 8 h reaction
time. Common types of sulfonic modified mesostructured silica are
propylsulfonic acid-modified SBA-15, arenesulfonic acid-modified
SBA-15, and perfluorosulfonic acid-modified SBA-15 as shown in
Fig. 8. According to Mbaraka and Shanks [45], these catalysts have
large mesopores compared to the sulfonic ion-exchange resin, and
the diffusion of reactants to the active site of the catalyst is

because of possible accumulation of organic matter on the catalyst
surface that can inhibit the reaction.

P2.2.2. Heterogeneous alkali-catalyzed transesterification

PIt was thought that heterogeneous alkali-catalyzed transester-
ification is able to overcome the problems faced in homogeneous
alkali-catalyzed transesterification. The use of a heterogeneous
alkali catalyst affords several advantages: (1) the catalyst is reus-
able; (2) it is more environmentally benign than a homogeneous
alkali catalyst; (3) it can be synthesized from inexpensive sour-
ces such as limestone or calcium hydroxide; (4) the amount of
alkali waste water is reduced; and (5) the catalyst activity is
almost the same as that of a homogeneous alkali catalyst under
the same operating conditions [46]. However, heterogeneous
alkali-catalyzed transesterification still
faces some challenges:
(1) the catalyst needs to be activated through a calcination pro-
cess at high temperatures; (2) the reaction rate is slower than
homogeneous alkali catalysis; and (3) side reactions may occur
owing to the reaction between the catalyst and glycerol that
generates calcium diglyceroxide [47], as shown in Fig. 9.

PSuitable heterogeneous alkali-catalysts include calcium oxide
(CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), strontium oxide (SrO), and hydro-
talcites (Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3.4(H2O)). According to Zabeti et al. [48],
CaO is the most attractive catalyst because of its small solubility in
methanol and the strongest basic activity among all alkaline earth
metal oxides. In a study reported by Kouzu et al. [49], a biodiesel

Pyield of 93% was obtained after 1 h transesterification at a methanol
reflux temperature of 64.7 °C with an oil-to-methanol ratio of 1:12
using a CaO catalyst from calcination of pulverized limestone
(CaCO3) at 900 °C for 1.5 h.

PKazembe-Phiri et al. [50] achieved a biodiesel yield of 89% from
ground nut oil after 2 h reaction time with an oil-to-ethanol molar
ratio of 1:9 using 1 wt% CaO calcined at 900 °C for 1.5 h. Di Serio
et al. [51] illustrated a FAME yield of only 20% from soybean oil at
100 °C. It is agreed in all previous studies that the activity of MgO is
much lower than that of CaO. To enhance the activity of MgO, Xie
et al. [52] demonstrated that hydrotalcite (Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3(cid:3)4H2O)
calcined at a high temperature resulted in a measurable activity. A
FAME yield of >90% was observed by employing a Mg-Al oxide cata-
lyst at a rather high reaction temperature [51].

PFig. 10 displays the reaction mechanism for CaO-catalyzed trans-
esterification of triglyceride using methanol as a reactant. This reac-
tion mechanism is comprised of several steps: (1) the formation of
methoxide anion through the proton abstraction from methanol by
the basic site of CaO, (2) the subsequent attack of the carbon atom in
the carbonyl group in triglyceride by the methoxide anion to gener-
ate the alkoxycarbonyl intermediate, (3) the rearrangement of the
intermediate resulting in the generation of more stable compounds
consisting of biodiesel and diglyceride anion, and (4) attack of the
calcium hydroxide cation by the diglyceride anion forming diglycer-
ide and CaO. It is seen that the catalyst is regenerated at the end. The
reaction mechanism is repeated two more times until biodiesel and
glycerol are obtained.

2.3. Enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel production

PChemical-catalyzed transesterification is hampered by the need
for wastewater treatment. It can be environmental unfriendly and
difficult to recover glycerol from the catalyst. A green method
employing enzyme as a catalyst, also known as a biocatalyst, has
been devised for producing biodiesel. Figs. 11 and 12 compare an
alkali catalyst and an enzyme in downstream operation. It is noticed
that enzyme-catalyzed transesterification is superior to alkali-cata-
lyzed transesterification due to its ability to eliminate the down-
stream operation required in alkali-catalyzed transesterification. In
particular, for the case of alkali-catalyzed transesterification, several
steps such as the evaporation of methanol and removal of saponified
product are needed to recover glycerol as by-product. Meanwhile,
for the case of enzyme-catalyzed process, the recovery of unreacted
methanol and wastewater treatment are unnecessary. Only a simple
concentration is required to recover glycerol. To remove the enzyme,
the filtration and simple washing with distilled water are needed
[19]. Thus, understandably the biodiesel product obtained by this
method is of high purity.

POther

advantages of

enzyme-catalyzed transesterification
include (1) the absence of byproducts, (2) the use of moderate reac-
tion temperatures (35‒45 °C), (3) easier separation and recovery of
product, (4) the high selectivity of esterification-transesterification
processes toward the substrate, (5) insensitivity to FFA and water
contents in the feedstock, (6) the avoidance of side reactions such as
saponification and hydrolysis, (7) lower oil-to-alcohol molar ratios
required, (8) a good possibility of enzyme reusability, (9) the ability
to convert FFA and triglyceride to biodiesel simultaneously, and (10)
the favorable biodegradability of the enzyme catalyst [15,19, 53, 54,
55, 56, 57].

PEnzyme-catalyzed transesterification also has its limitations,
especially for industrial implementation [19, 21, 58, 59]. The prob-
lems include (1) the high production cost of enzyme, (2) longer reac-
tion times compared to the alkali-catalyzed transesterification, (3)
enzyme inhibition by methanol, (4) enzyme deactivation, and (5)
limited enzyme regeneration that can lead to an extended operation
time.

PDuring the past few years, researchers have utilized lipase pro-
duced from microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and yeasts.
Lipase-producing fungi that were used in previous studies can be
found in Christopher et al. [60]. Among the lipase-producing micro-
organisms explored, Candida sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Rhizopus sp.
are the most frequently reported enzyme sources for biodiesel pro-
duction [61]. Lipase from Candida antarctica, also known as Novo-
zyme 435, was first used by Nelson et al. [62] using tallow as a
feedstock. They found a biodiesel yield of 96% at 45 °C, a tallow-to-
alcohol molar ratio of 1:3, a reaction time of 16 h, and a stirring
speed of 200 rpm. The addition of 6 mol% water relative to tallow
could improve ester production when a secondary alcohol was
employed. This can be easily understood because water is an essen-
tial to enhancing enzyme activity. However, the addition of a large
amount of water reduces the yield of biodiesel since the hydrolysis
of triglyceride generates FFA and diglyceride. It has been reported
that Candida antarctica immobilized on an acrylic resin is the most
useful lipase among extracellular enzymes employed for transesteri-
fication of vegetable oils using methanol as an acyl accpetor [62, 63,
64]. Novozyme 435, lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia (PS 30) has
also been used to produce biodiesel, but its catalytic activity was
low [62]. Nelson et al. [62] showed that the biodiesel yield from tal-
low using primary alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and isobuta-
nol is merely 14‒29%, whereas, by using isopropanol, a secondary
alcohol, a biodiesel yield of 44% was obtained with a reaction time of

P5 h, temperature at 45 °C, 0.34 mol/dm3 of triglyceride in hexane, an
oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:3, 12.5(cid:1)25 wt% enzyme, and a stir-
ring speed of 200 rpm. Noureddini et al. [66] also reported a biodie-
sel yield of 67% from 10 g soybean oil using an immobilized enzyme
from Pseudomonas cepacia at 35 °C, reaction time of 1 h, an oil-to-
methanol molar ratio of 1:7.5, 475 mg enzyme, and 50 g kg¡1 water.
Rhizopus oryzae is also one of the most commonly used lipase-pro-
ducing microorganisms for biodiesel production. Chen et al. [67]
found a biodiesel yield in the range of 88(cid:1)90% from enzymatic con-
version of waste cooking oil at 40 °C, 1 atm, reaction time of 30 h, an
oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:4, and immobilized lipase-to-oil
weight ratio of 30%.

PImmobilized whole cell (intracellular enzyme) technique can be
employed also to produce desirable results. A comparison of the
steps involved in using extracellular enzyme and immobilized whole
cell (intracellular enzyme) is presented in Fig. 13. The immobilized
whole cell technique is more efficient than the extracellular enzyme
technique which requires separation and purification of the enzyme
before its immobilization.

PEnzyme immobilization is a vital part in enzyme-catalyzed bio-
diesel production. In this process, enzymes are attached physically
to a solid support by adsorption [68], cross-linking [69], entrapment,
and ion exchange [70]. The solid supports can be either natural or
synthetic materials. According to Datta et al. [71], the support and
technique selection is based on the natures of the substrate and the

Penzyme, and the type of reaction. Compared to free enzymes, the
immobilized enzymes offers some advantages such as stabilization
of enzyme owing to binding with the support, rapid termination of
the enzyme-substrate reaction, and no contamination.

PMatsumoto et al. [72] developed a whole cell enzyme by immobi-
lizing Rhizopus oryzae cells. It was reported a biodiesel content of
71% at 37 °C after 165 h reaction time. In that study, stepwise metha-
nol addition to plant oil without solvent and water was employed. In
another study, Ban et al. [73] reported a high biodiesel conversion of
90% to with stepwise addition of methanol with 15% water content
using immobilized whole cell Rhizopus oryzae. They also found that
several substrate related compounds, especially olive oil and oleic
acid could enhance the methanolysis activity of the cells. Ban et al.
[74] also examined the effectiveness of crosslinking treatment along
with the addition of 0.1% glutaraldehyde in order to stabilize Rhizo-
pus oryzae. They observed a conversion to biodiesel of only 50% with-
out crosslinking, whereas, the conversion reached 72(cid:1)83% with
cross-linking after six batch cycles. Fukuda and Kondo [75] reported
that the reaction rate of biodiesel production using cells treated
with lower alcohols increased 350(cid:1)600 times compared to
untreated cells.

PEffect of alcohols on enzymatic activity for biodiesel production
was also examined. Biodiesel production requires three moles of
alcohol for each mole of triglyceride. The addition of excess alcohol
is common for shifting chemical equilibrium towards biodiesel

Pformation as transesterification proceeds reversibly [76]. On the
other hand, biodiesel yield was observed to decrease in enzymatic
biodiesel production in high methanol concentrations possibly
because the polar short chain of alcohol inhibits the enzyme activity
and interferes with the separation of glycerol [76,77]. For this rea-
son, enzymatic biodiesel production requires an alcohol-to-oil ratio
lower than chemically-catalyzed biodiesel production [79]. It is com-
mon to add alcohol in an oil-to-alcohol molar ratio of 1:3 and 1:6 for
enzymatic biodiesel production [78,80,81].

PEffect of oil-to-methanol molar ratio has been examined for
catalysis using immobilized lipase. Du et al. [82] reported the FAME
yields of 75%, 92%, and 80% by methanolysis using immobilized
lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus, employing oil-to-methanol
molar ratios of 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5, respectively, in a solvent-free sys-
tem. In addition, the maximum yield of biodiesel (95%) was achieved
by immobilized C. antarctica lipase at an oil-to-methanol molar ratio
of 1:3 [63]. In another study, Garlapati et al. [83] revealed a maxi-
mum yield of biodiesel (92%) by methanolysis of Simarouba glauca
oil using a fungal immobilized lipase and an oil-to-methanol molar
ratio of 1:1. From these studies, it may be concluded that the yield of
biodiesel is maximized by employing an oil-to-methanol molar ratio
between 1:1 and 1:5.

PMethanol, ethanol, propanol, n-butanol, isopropanol, and isobu-
tanol have also been used as the reaction media for enzyme-cata-
lyzed transesterification. Among them, methanol
is the most
frequently used due to its high reactivity and low cost. It was shown
by Nelson et al. [62] that short-chain alcohols inactivate enzymes
more easily than longer aliphatic alcohols. To overcome the problem
of inhibition caused by methanol addition in enzymatic biodiesel
production, strategies have been devised that includes (1) stepwise
addition of methanol [62,83,84] (2) the use of a solvent [86], and (3)
the use of alternative acyl acceptors such as alkyl esters or longer
chain alcohols [87].

PStepwise addition of methanol has been examined in some detail.
Shimada et al. [63] reported a biodiesel yield of 95% after 50 cycles of
operation through stepwise addition of methanol. Shimada [85]
obtained a conversion >90% to biodiesel via stepwise addition of
methanol using waste cooking oil as the feedstock. Watanabe et al.
[84] also observed an optimum yield of biodiesel (90%) in a two-step
batch-wise addition of methanol and a three-step continuous addi-
tion of methanol. The yield was maintained even after 100 batches
of operation. Similarly, a biodiesel yield of 97% was attained through

enzyme and (b) immobilized whole cell (intracellular enzyme) (adapted from [186]).

Pa three-step addition of 0.3 mol/dm3 equivalent of methanol using
plant oil as the feedstock [88].

PUse of organic solvents such as hexane, n-heptane, tert-butanol,
1,4-dioxane, benzene, and chloroform also reduces methanol inhibi-
tion through protection of lipase from denaturation because of an
increased solubility of methanol, the prevention of inhibition of
lipase catalyzed reactions due to an increased solubility of glycerol,
and the creation of single fluid phase [89,90]. Soumanou and Born-
scheuer [91] studied the effect of organic solvents on the alcoholysis
of sunflower oil using Pseudomonas fluorescens. It was found that the
conversion to biodiesel reached 80% by adding n-hexane and petro-
leum ether. The addition of tert-butanol could also enhance biodiesel
production. The yield reached 94% at 55 °C with an tert-butanol-oil
volume ratio of 0.8:1 after 48 h of reaction time [92]. The addition of
2-ethyl-1-hexanol improved the conversion of rapeseed oil to bio-
diesel to 97% [93]. Alternative acyl acceptors to methanol, including
isopropanol, tert-butanol, octanol, methyl acetate and ethyl acetate,
were shown to lessen the inhibition effect of methanol
[64,65,93,94].

2.4. Supercritical biodiesel production

PAn exciting alternative to catalytic transesterification is super-
critical biodiesel production. Proposed by Saka and Dadan [95], the
approach has some definitive advantages over other methods. For
example, it does not require a catalyst, has a high reaction rate

P(typically of the order of a few minutes), and allows for simultaneous
triglyceride transesterification and FFA esterification, a higher pro-
duction efficiency with a fewer number of processing steps (e.g.,
simpler separation and purification). In addition, supercritical proc-
essing is more tolerant to the presence of FFA and water and is appli-
cable to a wide variety of feedstock and amenable to continuous
operations.

PThe critical temperature and pressure of methanol is 239.2 °C and
8.09 MPa, respectively. Crossing the critical temperature and pres-
sure, dramatic changes in the mass density of methanol to occur
leading to changes its solubility and mass-transfer characteristics. In
supercritical methanol, triglyceride and methanol become a single
phase due to an increase in density of methanol and decrease of its
dielectric constant. The increase in density leads to a diminishing
polarity in methanol due to hydrogen bonding [95]. Thus, the non-
polar triglyceride is better dissolved in methanol under supercritical
conditions to form a homogeneous phase. The solubility of triglycer-
ide increases with increasing temperature and pressure as observed
by Glisic and Skala [96].

PThe phase behavior during methanolysis of triglyceride under
subcritical and supercritical conditions has been studied by Glisic
and Orlovic [97]. It was reported that during methanolysis, the dis-
tribution of methanol, triglyceride, biodiesel, and glycerol differed
depending on the temperature and pressure. They divided the phase
transition into three regimes as presented in Fig. 14. The first regime
occurs below 170 °C and 1.5 MPa. The second regime corresponds to
phase transition under the subcritical conditions (170(cid:1)220 °C and
1.5(cid:1)5.0 MPa), and the last regime occurs around the critical point.

PThe reaction mechanism between triglycerides and methanol
under supercritical conditions was first proposed by Kusdiana and
Saka [98]. As methanol clusters break into free monomers at high
temperatures and high pressures, they attack the carbon atom of the
carbonyl group in triglycerides, resulting in an intermediate via the
transfer of a methoxide moiety, as shown in Fig. 15. The next step is
the rearrangement of the intermediate to generate more stable com-
pounds, namely biodiesel and diglyceride. In a similar way, diglycer-
ide react with another methanol molecule to form biodiesel and
monoglyceride. The reaction between monoglyceride and methanol
results in biodiesel and glycerol.

PSupercritical biodiesel production faces some limitations such as
the need to use high oil-to-alcohol molar ratios and elevated tem-
perature and pressure. To circumvent these problems the use of co-
solvent and catalysts have been proposed. Kusdiana and Saka [99]
proposed a two-step processing, in which triglycerides are first
hydrolyzed in subcritical water to generate FFA and glycerol fol-
lowed by esterification of FFA supercritically in lower oil-to-metha-
nol molar ratios, as shown in Fig. 16. The two-step processing
certainly reduces energy consumption due to the milder operating
conditions (270 °C, 7 MPa) compared to one-step biodiesel produc-
tion (350 °C, 20(cid:1)50 MPa) and a substantially increased oil-to-metha-
nol molar ratio.

PCo-solvent has been proposed to reduce the severity of condi-
tions needed for supercritical biodiesel production in methanol.
Addition of a co-solvent can increase the mutual solubility between
triglycerides and methanol. Consequently, biodiesel can be produced
under milder conditions. Co-solvents that have been considered

Fig. 15. The proposed reaction mechanism between triglyceride and methanol under supercritical conditions (adapted from [98]).

Pinclude propane, carbon dioxide, ethane, n-butane, n-hexane, n-hep-
tane, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Cao et al. [100] reported that with a
propane-to-methanol molar ratio of 0.1, the reaction temperature
could be significantly reduced to 280 °C from 350 °C to obtain com-
plete conversion of biodiesel. Imahara et al. [101] found the addition
of CO2 as a co-solvent increased the yield of biodiesel in the metha-
nolysis of canola oil. However, the yield decreased above 0.1 CO2/
methanol in the molar ratio. By employing a microtube reactor,
Trentin et al. [102] investigated the effect of CO2 addition on biodie-
sel yield under supercritical conditions. They found the CO2-to-sub-
strate mass ratio of 0.2:1 to be optimal. Tan et al. [103] reported that
with an n-heptane-to-oil molar ratio of 0.2 n-heptane had a signifi-
cant effect on palm oil conversion to biodiesel in supercritical meth-
anol. n-Hexane as a co-solvent was studied by Muppaneni et al.
[104] who showed a n-hexane-to-oil volume ratio of 0.2 to be opti-
mal for the biodiesel yield.

PThe use of catalysts has been also proposed to improve biodiesel
production under supercritical conditions. Demirbas [105] investi-
gated the effect of CaO addition on the yield of biodiesel using sun-
flower oil as the feedstock. He reported that the biodiesel yield
increased with CaO addition. In addition, the maximum biodiesel
yield was observed within 6 min at 525 K, with an oil-to-methanol
molar ratio of 1:41 and addition of 3 wt% CaO. Yoo et al., [106] exam-
ined biodiesel production in supercritical methanol by adding metal
oxide catalysts such as SrO, CaO, ZnO, TiO2, and ZrO2. They

Pdemonstrated the yield to be around 95% by adding 1 wt% ZrO2 at
250 °C and with an oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:40 within
10 min reaction time. However, most of the heterogeneous catalysts
are not stable under supercritical conditions. A few heterogeneous
catalyst are stable under these conditions, such as zinc aluminate
and zirconia supported metal oxide catalysts [107,108]. Due to
undesirable stability of heterogeneous catalysts, the use of trace
amount of homogeneous catalysts under subcritical conditions was
also studied [109].

2.5. Microwave and ultrasound-assisted transesterification

PAdvantages of microwave-assisted transesterification include a
shorter reaction time and greater environmental friendliness than
the conventional heating process. Constraints include high-energy
consumption and all of the other limitations in catalytic transesterifi-
cation. For these reasons, microwave-assisted transesterification has
not been implemented in any commercial applications. Despite its
many disadvantages, many laboratory-scale experiments has been
reported recently. Leadbeater and Stencel [110] reported a maximum
biodiesel yield of 98% at 323 K using 5% KOH or NaOH under 25 W
microwave exit power and an oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:6
over a reaction time of 1 min. Similarly, Azcan and Danisman [111]
used KOH as a catalyst, and observed a maximum yield of 93.7%
using 1.0% KOH at 313 K, for 1 min reaction time. Zu et al. [112]

Pobserved a 96% yield from yellow horn (Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge)
oil at 60 °C, 500 W microwave power, an oil-to-methanol molar ratio
of 1:6, and 1 wt% catalyst for 6 min. Acid catalysts such as H2SO4/C
were used by Yuan et al. [113] as a catalyst in microwave irradiation.
The highest biodiesel yield was found to be 94% at 338 K with an oil-
to-methanol molar ratio of 1:12, and 5 wt% of catalyst for 60 min. El
Sherbiny et al. [114] compared biodiesel production using a conven-
tional method and microwave irradiation and demonstrated a faster,
more complete conversion (2 min) in microwave-assisted transesteri-
fication than the conventional method (60 min). Recently, direct,
microwave-assisted conversion was shown to produce biodiesel
from microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. at the yield of 38%, which is
higher than the sonication method yielding 21%, both with 5 min of
reaction time [115].

PUltrasound-assisted transesterification processes have been pro-
posed, though studies remain to be limited. Key drawbacks include
the use of a tremendous amount of the chemical catalyst, this
method remains commercially infeasible. Stavarache et al. [116]
used low-frequency ultrasound (28(cid:1)40 kHz) in biodiesel production
from a vegetable oil and found the yield as large as 98% at 25 °C,
40 kHz, an oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:6, 0.5% NaOH, and
20 min reaction time. Transesterification of palm oil was examined
by Mootabadi et al. [117] using the ultrasound method with oxides
of alkali-earth metals as the catalysts. They noticed that the yield
can reach 95% with an oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:15 and
60 min reaction time, when BaO and SrO were used as the catalysts.

3. Latest development in supercritical biodiesel production

PAs will be demonstrated below, supercritical biodiesel produc-
tion is one of the most promising techniques due to its many advan-
tages, including a large reaction rate, a short reaction time, and a
small sensitivity to water and FFA. Supercritical processing also
eliminated the need for catalyst use. A wide range of reactants and
reaction media have been explored, including methanol, ethanol,

Pmethyl acetate, and DMC. The major product and by-product
obtained from each reactant are summarized in Fig. 17. In what fol-
lows, we shall provide a detailed discussion of the results, reaction
mechanisms and kinetics from available studies.

3.1. Methanol

PBiodiesel production in supercritical methanol was proposed
first by Kusdiana and Saka [118]. Using a batch-type reactor, they
demonstrated that supercritical reaction could overcome many
problems encountered in chemically- and enzyme-catalyzed trans-
esterification. Measured yield data of rapeseed oil are provided in
Table S1 of the Supplementary Material. Using six vegetable oils
(cottonseed, hazelnut kernel, poppy seed, rapeseed, safflower seed,
and sunflower seed), Demirbas [119] further demonstrated that
non-catalytic biodiesel production in supercritical methanol was
superior over conventional methods in terms of reaction time
required to produce biodiesel. Biodiesel yield was observed to
increase with an increase in the temperature and residence time
(Table S2 of the Supplementary Materials). In addition, biodiesel
yield was also found to increase with an increase in the oil-to-
methanol molar ratio from 1:1 to 1:41.

PKusdiana and Saka [120] elucidated the reaction behavior of FFAs
in supercritical methanol. FFA was found to be converted into bio-
diesel at 350 °C with a yield of over 95%. Hence, a wide variety of
feedstock high in FFA contents including waste cooking oil and
waste lard could be converted to biodiesel under a non-catalytic
condition.

PKusdiana and Saka [98] noted that the presence of water did not
have a notable effect on biodiesel yield. In contrast, a certain amount
of water in the system could enhance biodiesel formation as water
could hydrolyze triglyceride into FFA and glycerol. FFA then reacts
with methanol to yield biodiesel. Obviously, bio-methanol prepared
from wood gasification has been demonstrated to be a viable source
for methanol [121]. Since bio-methanol could contain traces of

Pethanol, 1-butanol, methyl formate, water, and diisopropyl ether,
they confirmed that all but diisopropyl ether can participate in the
reactions biodiesel conversion.

PA large number of feedstock has been examined. Using a batch
reactor, Song et al. [122] investigated bleached and deodorized
(RBD) palm oil in supercritical methanol. They found that the biodie-
sel production rate increased dramatically under supercritical condi-
tions, but the FAME yield decreased above 350 °C due to thermal
decomposition of RBD palm oil and/or biodiesel (see Table S3 of the
Supplementary Materials). Tan et al. [123] determined that biodiesel
yield exceeded 70% from palm oil in supercritical methanol within
20 min reaction time (Table S4 of the Supplementary Materials).
Kasim et al. [124] reported the transesterification of rice bran, a low
cost feedstock, in supercritical methanol at 30 MPa, 300 °C and 5 min
reaction time and found a rather low yield (51%). The Jatropha curcas
L. seed has also been used by Lim et al. [125] as a feedstock via
supercritical reactive extraction. They observed an oil extraction effi-
ciency of 105% and a FAME yield of 104 wt% at 300 °C, 240 MPa,
2.5 mL/g of n-hexane to seed ratio, and 10.0 mL/g methanol-to-solid
ratio. Using the response surface method, Patil et al. [126] optimized
the single-step conversion of wet algal biomass (Inoculum Nanno-
chloropsis sp., CCMP1776), which is composed of »90% water, in
supercritical methanol and found the maximum yield to occur at
255 °C, 25 min reaction time and a wet algae-to-methanol (wt/v)
ratio of 1:9 (Table S5 of the Supplementary Materials). Anikeev and
Yakovleva [127] investigated biodiesel production from sunflower,
rapeseed, cottonseed, and camelina oils supercritical methanol, and
found that neither product yield nor the conversion is sensitive to
feedstock type.

PSamniang et al. [128] compared biodiesel production from two
non-edible oils: (Calophyllum inophyllum L.) and crude jatropha.
Yields reached 90% and 85%, respectively at 320 °C, 15 MPa and an
oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:40. A comparison of the yield data
is shown in Table S6 of the Supplementary Material.

PDemirbas [129] found that the supercritical methanol transes-
terification was superior to base-catalysis of low-grade feedstock
such as waste cooking oil and lard, because under the supercriti-
cal condition FFA in the waste cooking oil was transesterified
simultaneously and the process was insensitive to water and
FFA. In addition, using a batch-type reactor, Shin et al. [130]
noted that the biodiesel yield reached 90% from waste lard at
335 °C, 20 MPa, an oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:45 and an
agitation speed of 500 rpm within 15 min reaction time (see
Table S7 of the Supplementary Materials). Lee et al. [131] inves-
in supercritical methanol under rela-
tigated waste canola oil
(240(cid:1)270 °C and 10 MPa) and
tively moderate conditions
reported that the biodiesel yield reached 102% at 270 °C, 10 MPa,
an oil-to-methanol weight ratio of 2:1 with a reaction time of
45 min. Recently, in optimizing biodiesel production from waste
vegetable oil
in supercritical methanol, Ghoreishi and Moein
[132] showed a biodiesel yield of 95 at 271.1 °C, 23.1 MPa, an
oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:33.8 within about 20 min reac-
tion time. Results from aforementioned studies are compiled into
Fig. 18, and as expected, the yield increases with an increase in
reaction time. The results of Tan et al. [123] are excluded from
the plot because they are inconsistent with others.

PContinuous, supercritical flow reactor has been demonstrated for
biodiesel conversion. He et al. [133] found a maximum biodiesel
yield 77% from soybean oil at 310 °C, 35 MPa, and an oil-to-methanol
molar ratio of 1:40 after 25 min residence time (See Table S8 of the
Supplementary Materials). Similarly, using a vertical tubular reactor,
Zhou et al. [134] obtained a biodiesel yield as high as 92% at 375 °C
and 15 MPa, a fixed oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:40 after
23.3 min reaction time. Macaira et al. [59] carried out transesterifica-
tion of sunflower oil using a continuous reactor in supercritical
methanol with CO2 as a co-solvent. They deduced that the reaction

Fig. 18. Effect of residence time on biodiesel yield in a batch reactor using supercriti-
cal methanol.

Pof non-catalytic, supercritical biodiesel production was 20 times
faster than conventional methods under comparable conditions, and
the addition of a co-solvent enhance the rate further. They demon-
strated that a yield of 88% could be achieved at 200 °C after only
2 min reaction time.

PUsing a continuous reactor, Tsai et al. [135] found that from
waste cooking oil the effect of CO2 addition was negligible, in con-
trast to the findings of Macaira et al. [59]. The yield of biodiesel
reached 90% at 573.2 K within 13 min (Table S9 of the Supplemen-
tary Materials).

PRecently, an interesting study was reported that used a spiral
reactor [136] for biodiesel production in supercritical methanol. The
reactor was shown to be effective for transesterification with the
ability to recover heat. Complete conversion to biodiesel from canola
oil was achieved at 350 °C and 20 MPa within 10 min reaction time
(Table S10 of the Supplementary Materials).

PFig. 19 shows the effect of temperature and residence time on
biodiesel yield in continuous flow reactors. At 10 MPa, the biodiesel
yield increases with increases in temperature and residence time.
However, the biodiesel yield at 32 MPa increases as temperature is
increased from 280 to 320 °C, but it decreases thereafter.

PMechanistically, the transesterification of triglyceride under
supercritical methanol proceeds through three consecutive reaction
steps, as shown in Fig. 20. First, the reaction between triglyceride
and methanol results in FAME and diglyceride generation. As an
intermediate compound, diglyceride reacts further with methanol to
generate FAME and monoglyceride. Finally, the reaction between
monoglyceride and methanol yields FAME and glycerol.

PHe et al. [137] examined the reaction kinetics of soybean oil con-
version to biodiesel in supercritical methanol. The overall activation
energy and activation volume were measured to be 56 kJ/mol and
¡206 cm3/mol, respectively. Similarly, Varma and Madras [138] also
determined the activation energy of reactions to be 35.0 and 46.5 kJ/
mol for castor and linseed oils, respectively, from 200 to 350 °C at
20 MPa. Recently, Choi et al. [139] deduced the activation energy,
entropy of activation, and reaction activation volume to be 81.4 kJ/
mol, ¡175.35 J/(mol-K), and ¡233.29 cm3/mol, respectively,
for
palm olein oil in supercritical methanol at 350 °C, 35 MPa, and an
oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:40 over a residence time of 20 min.

tor, and reported the 45.9, 31.2, and 79.5 kJ/mol for the reactions of
triglyceride to diglyceride (k1), diglyceride to monoglyceride (k2),
and monoglyceride to glycerol (k3), respectively. He et al. [137] mea-
sured the activation energies of k1, k2 and k3 to be 59.4, 58.6, and
67.4 kJ/mol, respectively, also using a batch reactor operating at
28 MPa and between 240 and 280 °C.

3.2. Ethanol

in sub- and supercritical ethanol

PEthanol can be derived from biomass via fermentation. It is
therefore of interest to explore biodiesel production in supercrit-
ical ethanol. Silva et al. [140] investigated the conversion of soy-
bean oil to biodiesel
in a
tubular reactor operating from 473 to 648 K and pressure from 7
to 20 MPa, and with an oil-to-ethanol molar ratio from 1:10 to
1:100. Under subcritical conditions, the conversion to fatty acid
ethyl ester (FAEE) was low. Yet in supercritical ethanol a biodie-
sel yield as high as 80% was observed at 623 K, 20 MPa, and an
oil-to-ethanol molar ratio of 1:40 within 15 min reaction time.
Vieitez et al. [141] reported continuous biodiesel production
from soybean oil in supercritical ethanol with water addition at
350 °C, 20 MPa, and an oil-to-ethanol molar ratio of 1:40. The
results show biodiesel yields of 78% and 68% without and with
10 wt% of water addition, respectively (Table S11 of the Supple-
mentary Materials). Clearly, the presence of water has a negative
effect on process efficiency.

PGui et al. [142] presented the results of optimized supercritical
ethanol process by varying temperature (300(cid:1)400 °C), the ethanol-
to-oil molar ratio (5(cid:1)50), and reaction time (2(cid:1)30 min). Using a sys-
tematic, response surface approach, they reported an optimum yield
of biodiesel of 79% at 349 °C, an oil-to-ethanol molar ratio of 1:33
and reaction time of 30 min. Quite significantly, direct conversion of
the 3rd generation feedstock, i.e., microalgae Nannochloropsis salina,

flow reactor using supercritical methanol (oil-to-methanol oil ratio 1:40).

PDetermination of the rate parameters can be complicated by the
type of reactor used in the study. The batch-type reactor has difficul-
ties in treating the heating-up and cooling-down of the reactor.
Fig. 21 presents the Arrhenius plots of rate constants reported for
the three reaction stages during supercritical transesterification in
methanol. The activation energy reported for the forward reactions
by Farobie and Matsumura [136] are higher than those obtained by
Kusdiana and Saka [118] and He et al. [137]. Kusdiana and Saka
[118] determined the rate constants of rapeseed oil conversion in

POne of the advantages of supercritical transterification over
chemical and enzyme-catalyzed processes is the easiness in carrying
out the reaction in a continuous manner. Da Silva [144] showed con-
tinuous production of biodiesel from soybean oil using microtube
and tubular reactors at 523(cid:1)598 K, 10(cid:1)20 MPa, and the oil-to-etha-
nol molar ratio of 1:10(cid:1)1:40 with CO2 added as co-solvent. The
microtube reactor with an inner diameter of 0.76 mm gave higher
biodiesel yields than the tubular reactor with an inner diameter of
3.2 mm. They attributed this to the mass transfer phenomenon. In
the microtube reactor, mass transfer is enhanced due to the faster
flow through the reactor than that for the tubular reactor, no such
flow can be obtained. CO2 as a co-solvent appeared to offer little
improvements to the yield. Relevant data are reported in Table S12
of the Supplementary Materials.

PFig. 22(a) and (b) show the biodiesel yield at 20 MPa and the oil-
to-ethanol molar ratios of 1:20 and 1:40, respectively, as a function
of temperature and residence time. For both ratios, the yields
increase with both temperature and residence time as expected. For
the ratio of 1:20, the results of Silva et al. [140] are in a good agree-
ment with those of Da Silva et al. [144]. At 375 °C, the yield decreases
after 10 min reaction time. Lastly, the yields are higher for the 1:40
ratio than the 1:20 ratio, as can be seen in the figure.

PTrentin et al. [102] investigated continuous biodiesel production
in supercritical ethanol using a microtube reactor, but found no sig-
nificant difference in results from those of Da Silva [144].

reaction in supercritical methanol. The data are taken from Farobie and Matsumura

Pwithout pretreatment was reported by Reddy et al. [143]. They con-
firmed that the highest yield of biodiesel to be 67% at 265 °C, using
the dry algae-to-ethanol (w/v) ratio of 1:9 over 20 min reaction
time.

PAdditionally, Vieitez et al. [145] reported continuous production of
biodiesel from castor oil and reported a yield reaching 74% at 573 K
and 20 MPa with 5 wt% water addition, and a feedstock flow rate of
0.8 mL/min.

PThe effects of FFA, co-solvent, and catalyst addition on biodiesel
production in supercritical ethanol have also been examined previ-
ously. In a continuous supercritical ethanol process, Vietiez et al.
[146] found that FFA addition enhanced the conversion efficiency of
soybean, rice bran, and high oleic sunflower oils to biodiesel. As a
co-solvent, n-hexane was found to increase biodiesel yields from
camelina [104] and palm oils [147] under a reduced severity in oper-
ating conditions. In these same studies, optimization showed that
for camelina oil, the maximum yield could be achieved at 295 °C, an
oil-to-ethanol molar ratio of 1:45, an n-hexane-to-oil ratio of 0.2%
(v/v), and over 20 min reaction time, whereas for palm oil the opti-
mal conditions were 300 °C, an oil-to-ethanol molar ratio of 1:33,
and an n-hexane-to-oil ratio of 0.4% (v/v) over 30 min reaction time.
PSupercritical transterification in ethanol appears to be less effi-
cient than in methanol. Using rapeseed oil in the batch mode reactor,
Warabi et al. [148] established that in supercritical methanol the
yield of biodiesel reaches 100% within 15 min reaction time, but it
required 45 min in supercritical ethanol. Tan et al. [103] observed
that supercritical methanol leads to a conversion of about 85% over a
shorter reaction time than supercritical ethanol with a yield of 79%.
Similarly, Vieitez [149] found that the conversion to biodiesel by
methanolysis was higher than by ethanolysis, as did Santana et al.
[150] who noted that supercritical methanol gave a biodiesel yield
of 90% in 2 min whereas in supercritical ethanol a yield of 80% was
achieved in 6 min. Similar results were also reported very recently
by Kiss et al. [151].

PTriglyceride conversion to biodiesel in supercritical ethanol also
proceeds in a three reversible reaction steps nearly identically to
that in supercritical methanol as shown in Fig. 20. Kinetically, Velez
et al. [152] proposed a first-order kinetic model and determined the
rate parameters for sunflower oil conversion to FAEE in supercritical
ethanol using a continuous mode reactor. The activation energy of
the overall reaction was reported to be 67.6 kJ/mol. Santana et al.
[150] derived the activation energy values for the forward and
reverse reactions of the three step processes as E1 1⁄4 104.8, E(cid:1)1 1⁄4
98.3, E2 1⁄4 91.7, E(cid:1)2 1⁄4 58.6, E3 1⁄4 126.0, and E(cid:1)3 1⁄4 140.0 kJ/mol (see
Fig. 20). In another study and using a tubular reactor in a continuous
mode, Silva et al. [140] obtained an activation energy of 78.7 kJ/mol
for transesterification of soybean oil in supercritical ethanol. Activa-
tion energies in supercritical ethanol are larger than those in super-
critical methanol, confirming that ethanol had a lower reactivity
than methanol.

3.3. Methyl acetate

PProposed by Saka and Isayama [153], the major reasoning behind
using methyl acetate is its transesterification byproduct, triacetin
which is of a higher value than glycerol. The global reaction steps of
biodiesel production in supercritical methyl acetate is presented in
Fig. 23. Similarly to the methanol route, transesterification of triglyc-
eride in supercritical methyl acetate also proceeds in three reaction
steps. In the first stage, reaction between triglyceride and methyl
acetate results in FAME and monoacetin diglyceride, which reacts
with another methyl acetate molecule to form FAME and diacetin
monoglyceride. FAME and triacetin are generated in the last reaction
step. Overall, one triglyceride molecule reacts with three methyl

Pacetate to generate three biodiesel molecules and one triacetin. The
reaction is reversible and it requires a large amount of methyl ace-
tate to obtain complete conversion to biodiesel [154].

PSaka and Isayama [153] investigated transesterification of rape-
seed oil in supercritical methyl acetate in the temperature range of
270(cid:1)380 °C for a reaction time of 10(cid:1)120 min, a fixed pressure of
20 MPa, and an oil-to-methyl acetate molar ratio of 1:42. The biodie-
sel yield data are presented in Table S13 of the Supplementary Mate-
rials. Biodiesel was produced at the yield of 105% with triacetin as
the byproduct without glycerol formation. Moreover, triacetin in
biodiesel appear to affect very little the drop point and oxidation
characteristics of the biodiesel.

PTan et al. [155] conducted transesterification of palm oil in super-
critical methyl acetate using a batch-type tube reactor and opti-
mized the operation with respect to the yield. The yield of biodiesel
was 98% at 399 °C with an oil-to-methyl acetate molar ratio of 1:30
and over a reaction time of 59 min. In another study [156], the same
authors noted that the highest yield of biodiesel (99%) could be
obtained at 400 °C and 22 MPa with an oil-to-methyl acetate molar
ratio of 1:30, and over a reaction time of 60 min (Table S14 of the
Supplementary Materials).

POptimization was also carried out by Goembira and Saka [157]
who examined four key factors affecting the yield, namely, tempera-
ture, reaction time, pressure, and the oil-to-methyl molar ratio. They
found that for rapeseed oil in supercritical methyl acetate the opti-
mal condition was 350 °C, 20 MPa, 54 min reaction time, and an oil-
to-methyl acetate molar ratio of 1:42. Under this condition, the
FAME yield was 97 wt% and the triacetin yield was 8.8 wt% (see Table
S15 of the Supplementary Materials for additional data).

PCampanelli et al. [158] also investigated biodiesel synthesis
from soybean, sunflower, J. curcas, and waste soybean oil using
the same approach. They observed that the composition of feed-
stock did not significantly affect the yield. A complete conversion
to biodiesel was observed at 345 °C, 20 MPa, an oil-to-methyl
acetate of 1:42, and reaction time of 50 min for all feedstock
considered. Data from their study is summarized in Table S16 of
the Supplementary Materials.

PThe FFA content in the feedstock affects the biodiesel yield. Using
a tubular packed bed reactor, Dona et al. [159] studied soybean and
macauba oils in supercritical methyl acetate and reported that the
yield was merely 44% for soybean at 350 °C and an oil-to-methyl ace-
tate molar ratio of 1:5 over 45 min reaction time. In comparison,
macauba oil achieved a maximum biodiesel yield of 83% at 325 °C,
and an oil-to-methyl acetate molar ratio of 1:5 for 45 min reaction
time. The difference is possibly caused by the FFA content which is
significantly higher in macauba oil. The authors suggested that FFA
reacted with methyl acetate to generate FAME and acetic acid fol-
lowing the reaction as presented in Fig. 24. They also concluded that
the acetic acid generated could act as an acid catalyst to enhance
transesterification. Relevant data of FAME yields are summarized in
Table S17 of the supplementary materials. Fig. 25 presents the FAME
yield as a function of temperatures and residence time. Biodiesel

cal methyl acetate conditions at 20 MPa.

Pyields increased by increasing temperature from 300 °C to 380 °C
due to the fact that higher reaction temperature would result in the
higher reaction rates, which eventually correspond to the higher bio-
diesel yields. However, in some cases, particularly at the tempera-
tures above 338 °C, the biodiesel yield was initially increased to a
certain extent, but it was decreased over a prolonged reaction time.
Niza et al. [160] elucidated the different reaction behaviors in super-
critical methanol and methyl acetate using J. curcas oil. They
reported that the maximal yield of biodiesel was 89% in supercritical
methanol at 358 °C, 27 min reaction time, and an oil-to-methanol
molar ratio of 1:44, whereas the same yield was 72% in supercritical
methyl acetate at 400 °C, 32 min reaction time, and an oil-to-metha-
nol molar ratio of 1:50. The difference was attributed to the reactiv-
ity and mutual solubility. The thermal stability of biodiesel
production in supercritical methyl acetate was examined by the
same researchers from 330 to 420 °C [161]. They observed a reduc-
tion in thermal stability of poly-unsaturated methyl linoleate with
increasing temperature from 330 to 420 °C, while the thermal
decomposition of methyl oleate occurred above 390 °C. Thermal
decomposition mechanism of biodiesel under supercritical condi-
tions were studied in details by Lin et al. [162], Nan et al. [163], and
Liu et al. [164]. They found that thermal decomposition of biodiesel
involves isomerization, polymerization (Diels-Alder reaction), and
pyrolysis reactions in which these reactions occur in the tempera-
ture ranges of 275(cid:1)400 °C, 300(cid:1)425 °C, and >350 °C, respectively.

PThe reaction kinetics of transesterification in supercritical methyl
acetate was examined in only one study. Campanelli et al. [158]
examined the reaction kinetics of oil conversion to biodiesel from
300 to 345 °C and found the overall activation energy to be 373, 349,
364, and 369 kJ/mol for soybean, sunflower, J. curcas, and waste soy-
bean oil, respectively.

PEffect of additives in supercritical methyl acetate transterification
were reported recently by Goembira and Saka [165]. They demon-
strated that the addition of acetic acid and water could enhance the

Pbiodiesel yield, whereas the addition of oleic acid and methanol did
not affect the yield. At 300 °C, a higher yield was obtained when
aqueous acetic acid was employed as an additive. In addition, the
highest biodiesel yield was obtained at 300 °C, 20 MPa, 45 min reac-
tion time by adding 10 wt% aqueous acetic acid. Thus, additives
could enhance biodiesel production via the supercritical methyl ace-
tate route.

POther carboxylate esters have also been used as reactants as well
as reaction media for supercritical biodiesel production [154].
Among the 12 carboxylate esters studied, methyl acetate gave the
highest yield of biodiesel at 98%. Clearly, the shorter chain in methyl
acetate resulted in a higher reactivity with triglyceride.

3.4. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC)

PSupercritical DMC presents yet another route to producing bio-
diesel. In this route, biodiesel and glycerol dicarbonate are obtained.
In contrast to supercritical methanol, ethanol, and methyl acetate,
the global reaction steps in supercritical DMC proceeds via a two-
step reversible reaction process as depicted in Fig. 26. The reaction
between triglyceride and DMC produces FAME and fatty acid glyc-
erol carbonate (FAGC). Next, FAGC reacts with another DMC to gen-
erate the second FAME molecule and glycerol dicarbonate.

PStudies pertaining to biodiesel production in supercritical DMC
are still limited. Ilham and Saka [166] were the first to investigate
biodiesel production from rapeseed oil in supercritical DMC using a
batch-type reactor (5 cm3 vessel) made of Inconel alloy-625. They
observed that the reaction produced FAME, glycerol carbonate and
citramalic acid. A conversion to biodiesel of about 94% (w/w)
was achieved at 350 °C, 20 MPa, and an oil-to-dimethyl carbonate

Pmolar ratio of 1:42 after 12 min reaction time. They noted that
FFA could react with DMC to generate FAME and glyoxal as pre-
sented in Fig. 27.

PIlham and Saka [167] also proposed a two-step supercritical DMC
method to produce biodiesel from J. curcas oil under a milder condi-
tion under which triglyceride was first hydrolyzed in subcritical
water and subsequently esterified in supercritical DMC as shown in
Fig. 28. The optimum condition to produce FFA from triglyceride
under subcritical water was found to be at 270 °C, 27 MPa and over
25 min reaction time, while in supercritical DMC alone, the condition
was given as 300 °C, 9 MPa and 15 min, under which 97% biodiesel
yield was obtained.

PTan et al. [168] investigated the effect of key factors such as tem-
perature, reaction time, and oil-to-DMC molar ratio in biodiesel pro-
duction from palm oil. They found that a 91% yield of biodiesel was
attained under the optimal condition at 380 °C, 30 min, and an oil-
to-DMC molar ratio of 1:39. In another study by Ilham and Saka
[169], the optimal condition was found to be 300 °C, 20 MPa, 20 min
reaction time, and oil-to-DMC molar ratio of 1:42, with a 97% yield.
The different optimal conditions could be attributed to the different
experimental conditions of which the effect of pressure was
neglected for the study by Tan et al [168].

PCoconut oil has been converted to biodiesel in supercritical DMC
in an atmospheric-pressure tubular reactor, as reported by Kwon
et al. [170]. A nearly complete conversion (98% yield) to biodiesel
was achieved in a short reaction time of 1(cid:1)2 min at 365(cid:1)450 °C. Rel-
evant data are summarized in Table S18 of the Supplementary Mate-
rials.

tion of reaction time and temperature using data reported by Ilham

Pand Saka [169]. For all cases, the biodiesel yield increased with tem-
perature and residence time.

3.5. Tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE)

PAnother interesting route to biodiesel is by using MTBE. Proposed
by Farobie et al. [171], supercritical transterification in MTBE, produ-
ces FAME and glycerol tert-butyl ether (GTBE). It was reported that
GTBE improves the biodiesel quality by increasing its cetane num-
ber, reducing particulate matter and CO emissions, and decreasing
the cloud point (CP) [172,173].

PThe global reaction steps of biodiesel production in supercritical
MTBE also comprises of three consecutive, reversible reactions, as
shown in Fig. 30. Triglyceride reacts first with MTBE to produce
diglyceride mono-tert-butyl ether (DGE) which reacts with MTBE to

Fig. 29. Biodiesel yield obtained in supercritical dimethyl carbonate. The data are
taken from Ilham and Saka [166].

Pgenerate monoglyceride di‒tert-butyl ether (MGE). Finally, MGE
reacts with MTBE to yield FAME and GTBE.

PThe effects of temperature and residence time on biodiesel yield
in supercritical MTBE is shown in Fig. 31 with data taken from Faro-
bie and Matsumura [174], which is the only study that evaluated
these effects. Again, for all the cases, the biodiesel yield increases
with increases in temperature and residence time.

PFig. 32 presents a comparison of FAME yields from canola oil in
supercritical methanol (375 °C and 15 MPa) [134], ethanol (350 °C
and 20 MPa) [140], methyl acetate (350 °C and 20 MPa) [159], and
MTBE (400 °C and 10 MPa) [171] in a continuous-mode reactor.
Kinetically, conversion in supercritical methanol is the fastest among
the reactants compared. The conversion in supercritical MTBE is
notably lower than methanol despite the higher temperature and
the fact that supercritical MTBE gives the yield almost the same as in
methanol over longer reaction times. Interestingly, the yield in
supercritical MTBE is larger than methyl acetate probably because of
the low polarity in MTBE as compared to methyl acetate, leading to a
better miscibility of MTBE with oil. The better miscibility of MTBE
circumvents the mass transfer problem of more polar compounds.

4. Empirical rate expressions of supercritical biodiesel
production

PIt is well known that transesterification consists of a three-step
reversible reaction. Modifications of the model have been proposed
by considering the order and reversibility of the reactions, and ten
commonly used kinetic models have been evaluated [175]. However,
in supercritical transterification, methanol is used in excess stoichio-
metrically. The forward reactions became dominant and each reac-
tion step can be regarded as an irreversible reaction. If we assume
that methanolysis of triglycerides (TG) is the rate-controlling step of
the overall reaction, the transesterification reaction of TG can be
defined by:

Pshow fairly weak dependency of the reaction rate on the concentra-
tion of the reactant but they are close to the first order for the oil
concentration. The results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 39. The reac-
tion rate constants for supercritical 1-propanol and 1-butanol are
also plotted under the reaction condition of 300 °C [145]. As can be
observed, activation energies follow the order of: methanol (cid:2) DMC
< ethanol < MTBE < methyl acetate.

PAs shown in Fig. 39, the reaction rate of biodiesel synthesis in
methanol is the highest, owing possibly to its small molecular size,
which enables the oxygen atom from methanol to readily attack the
carbon atom of the carbonyl functional group from triglycerides. The
second highest reaction rate is for supercritical DMC. The two
methoxyl groups in DMC increase the reaction probability for it to
attach triglyceride to generate fatty acid methyl ester. The reactivity
in MTBE is almost the same as in ethanol. The reactivity of MTBE

Pcould be caused by its decomposition into the methoxy and t-butyl
radicals under the temperature and pressure of the reaction. The t-
butyl radical may have a high concentration due to its stability due
to the hyperconjugation effect, leading to appreciable radical reac-
tions in the overall reaction process. Finally, the lowest reactivity is
observed for methyl acetate, which may be attributed to the neces-
sity of breaking the methyl ketone-methoxy bond in order for the
reaction to occur, and the methyl ketone radical is not a stable inter-
mediate.

5. Factors affecting supercritical biodiesel production

5.1. Temperature and reaction time

PReaction time, together with temperature, plays an important
role in determining the reaction kinetics of supercritical oil conver-
sion to biodiesel. In all reports pertaining to supercritical methanol
and ethanol, oil conversion to biodiesel mainly increased with reac-
tion temperature and time. It was owing to an increase in the reac-
tion rate constant based on Arrhenius equation and a change of
alcohol properties at high temperatures and high pressures. The
effect of temperature on biodiesel yield in supercritical methanol
was first investigated by Kusidana and Saka [118]. They studied
the effect of temperature over the temperature and pressure
ranges of 200 °C/7 MPa to 487 °C/105 MPa. They reported that at
200 and 230 °C, the biodiesel yield was relatively low owing to
the subcritical state of methanol. A complete conversion of rape-
seed oil to biodiesel was found at 350 °C after 4 min obtaining

Pratio (42), a complete conversion was apparent with methyl ester
yield of 95%. However, methanol molar ratio more than 50 gave no
benefits. Similar results were reported by Varma and Madras [138],
Song et al. [122], He et al. [133], Goembira and Saka [157], and Tan
et al. [156].

the reaction should be completed with respect

PClearly, oil-to-alcohol molar ratio affects chemical equilibrium,
and higher molar amount of alcohol for the same amount of triglyc-
eride drives the chemical equilibrium to the product side. Consider-
ing that
to
triglyceride so that separation of reactant can be considered only for
the alcohol and not for triglyceride, the oil-to-alcohol molar ratio of
1:40 is recommended. Note that adding more alcohol cannot
improve the yield once complete conversion is achieved, and it will
make separation of alcohol from the product more energy-consum-
ing.

5.3. Pressure

PPressure also plays an important role on biodiesel production
under supercritical conditions since it affects the supercritical fluid
properties including hydrogen bond intensity, density, and viscosity.
Shin et al. [130] investigated the effect of pressure on biodiesel con-
tent in a batch reactor at a fixed temperature of 335 °C and oil-to-
methanol molar ratio of 1:45. It was reported that an increase in
pressure from 15 to 20 MPa resulted in a higher biodiesel yield, but
it was relatively constant at pressures above 20 MPa. Similar results
were reported by Goembira and Saka [157] and Ilham and Saka
[169]. The pressure effect on supercritical biodiesel production using
various reactants is presented in Table 2.

PConsidering the fact that the reaction to produce of biodiesel does
not change the molar number of the molecules (4 mol to 4 mol), the
effect of pressure on chemical equilibrium should not be observed.
Its effect should be more on the chemical reaction rate due to the
higher molecular density and homogenization of the phase due to
the miscibility of supercritical alcohol with oil. As reported by Ani-
tescu et al. [182], the pressure could affect the mixing of the reaction
mixtures. A homogeneous reaction phase could be achieved if the
pressure is appropriately selected. Because too high pressure results
in higher cost of the reactor, pressure around 20 MPa is recom-
mended for biodiesel production using supercritical alcohols.

P95% of biodiesel. At 400 °C, a complete conversion needed only
2 min. However, thermal decomposition of biodiesel occurred at
temperatures above 400 °C. Similar results were reported by
Rathore and Madras (2007) [178], Imahara et al. [179], and Lin
et al. [180].

PAt higher temperatures, usually above 400 °C, thermal cracking of
triglyceride also occurred as reported by Marulanda et al. [181].
Fig. 40 shows the products of thermal cracking of triglyceride under
supercritical conditions.

PConsidering decomposition of structure required for the biodie-
sel, the reaction temperature around 350 °C is recommended for the
biodiesel production using supercritical alcohol. Reaction rates of
isomerization, polymerization, and Diels(cid:1)Alder reaction should be
determined in addition to the biodiesel production rates derived in
this review to find the detailed optimum conditions.

5.2. Oil-to-reactant molar ratio

6. Challenges and recommendations for future work

PStoichiometrically, transesterification of triglyceride requires
three molecules of methanol. However, since the transesterification
process is reversible, an enormous amount of methanol is needed to
achieve a complete conversion. The effect of oil-to-methanol molar
ratio was first studied by Kusdiana and Saka [120] in the range of
1:3.5(cid:1)1:42. It was reported that at the lower methanol molar ratio
(6 or less), incomplete conversion to biodiesel was observed result-
ing in lower yield of biodiesel. However, at higher methanol molar

6.1. Energy recovery

PDespite the many advantages of supercritical biodiesel produc-
tion, this technology is still facing many challenges. One such chal-
lenge is the energy efficiency of the process. As we discussed in
Section 5.1., the desired temperature for supercritical transesterifi-
cation is 350 °C. The conversion reactions are largely endorthermic
with reaction enthalpy of 39.89 kJ/mol for supercritical methanol.

POne possible solution to improving the energy efficiency is to use
a spiral reactor design. This reactor is composed of a parallel tube
heat exchanger and a high temperature transesterification reactor as
shown in Fig. 41. It was reported that the spiral reactor was superior
to conventional reactor in terms of heat recovery. In addition, the
effectiveness of this reactor was also been investigated for biodiesel
production using supercritical MTBE. Our research group found that
the spiral reactor performed well for biodiesel production using
supercritical MTBE, affording a higher FAME yield compared to the
conventional flow reactor for the same residence time [174]. More-
over, the spiral reactor employed here was effective for biodiesel
production using supercritical MTBE due to the successful recovery
of the heat [183].

PEnergy analysis for biodiesel production under supercritical con-
ditions has been carried out by Farobie and Matsumura [183], com-
paring conventional and spiral reactors shown in Fig. 42. Here,
analysis for biodiesel production in supercritical methanol is shown

Pas an example. Analyses in supercritical ethanol and MTBE can be
found elsewhere [43, 69].

PEnergy required to heat the reactant stream to the described
reaction temperature (Qheating) for supercritical methanol was calcu-
lated to be 1.095 MJ/d using Eq. (14).

Pwhere mBDF,h is mass flow rate of biodiesel fuel produced (0.6038 kg/
d), Cp,BDF is specific heat of biodiesel fuel (1.80 kJ/(kg K)), DTh is the
temperature difference from the reactor center to the outlet (271 °

Cp,GL is the specific heat of glycerol (2.41 kJ/(kg- K)), mMeOH,h is the
mass flow rate of unreacted methanol (0.8851 kg/d), and Cp,MeOH is
the specific heat of methanol (2.51 kJ/(kg K)).

PThe total energy supply for biodiesel production in the spiral
reactor was determined by subtracting recovered heat from the heat
required to achieve reaction temperature, and was calculated to be
merely 0.1589 MJ/d. Obviously, the energy recovered in the conven-
tional reactor is zero, and the energy supply is therefore several fac-
tors larger than that of the spiral reactor.

PThe calculation of energy analysis for biodiesel production in a
spiral reactor was not only evaluated for supercritical methanol but
also for supercritical ethanol and MTBE. Fig. 43 shows the compari-
sons of energy efficiency calculated for supercritical methanol, etha-
nol, and MTBE. Energy efficiency (he) and heat recovery efficiency
(Qeff) were determined using Eqs. (16) and (17), respectively. Please

PHere, he represents energy efficiency, Ep represents the total
energy in the products [MJ/d], Ef represents the total energy in the
feedstock [MJ/d], Qeff represents the heat recovery efficiency, Qrecov-
ery represents the energy from the recovered heat [MJ/d], and Qheating
represents the energy required to attain the reaction temperature
[MJ/d].

PAs can be seen, energy efficiency and heat recovery efficiency of
the spiral reactor were 0.98 and 0.85, respectively, and they were
the same for all processes. The difference of total energy in the feed-
stock and product among three reactants could be attributed to the
difference of optimum conditions. Again, the optimum conditions
for the supercritical biodiesel production using methanol, ethanol,
and MTBE were achieved within 10, 30, and 30 min, respectively
[177].

6.2. Excessive amount of reactants

ratio for

PAnother challenge of supercritical biodiesel production is an
excessive amount of reactants required to achieve the complete con-
version of oil to biodiesel. As we mentioned in Section 5.2., the opti-
mum oil-to-reactant molar
supercritical biodiesel
production is 1:40. This amount is 5 times larger than the conven-
tional biodiesel production using homogeneous alkali-catalyzed
transesterification. The excessive amount of reactant results in high
cost needed for biodiesel production process. The subsequent reac-
tant recovery also needs high energy consumption. An alternative
way to overcome this severity is by employing integration process of
supercritical biodiesel production and reactant recovery at the same
time.

and

intermediate

PBesides above challenges, there are still several limitations that
need to be addressed before this technology could play a vital role in
industrial applications. Those include safety issue during the opera-
tion process, coking in the reactor, the impurities such as metal con-
tent
and
monoglyceride, the engine evaluation, and the cost of this technol-
ogy. Since supercritical biodiesel production requires high tempera-
ture and high pressure, the safety issue is still in debate. In addition,
the coking in the reactor may occur due to the formation of char and
tarry material. The impurities such as heavy material and intermedi-
ate compounds of diglyceride and monoglyceride should be recov-
ered in order to obtain high biodiesel quality.

PFrom economic point of view, this technology requires high cost
which involved expensive expenditure in furnaces and high pressure
pumps. Furthermore, the cost to fabricate a huge spiral reactor for
commercialization purposes will be enormous. Some strategies to
reduce the cost include the use of integration process and utilization
of waste or non-edible oil. To quantitatively prove the applicability
of this technology, the technical issues including engine evaluation
and economic feasibility are required for further study.

6.3. Recommendations for future work

PEven though biodiesel production under supercritical conditions
has enormous benefits, its feasibility in commercial applications
remains debatable. Laboratory scale analyses, tests and finding are
not always directly indicative of potential for technology success at
the industrial scale. Given this consideration, we make the following
recommendations for future work:

P(1) Biodiesel production in supercritical methyl acetate, DMC, and
MTBE enable generation of value-added byproducts. The appli-
cation of these byproducts requires further investigation.

P(2) There is a lack of economic analysis on supercritical biodiesel
production. Such an analysis would help to bridge the laboratory
studies with real-world application.

P(3) Since the supercritical technology requires high temperature,
methods to reduce the severity of conditions, e.g., a two-step
supercritical methyl acetate, DMC, or MTBE method for biodiesel
production should be studied in more detail. Another method to
reduce the severity of condition is to add co-solvents, e.g., n-
hexane. Since the critical pressure and temperature of n-hexane
is much lower than those of alcohols, methyl acetate, DMC, and
MTBE, the addition of the co-solvent would help to achieve the
higher biodiesel yields under milder conditions. The use of co-
solvents can also reduce the amount of reactants required to
achieve high yields.

P(4) Biodiesel production using supercritical method requires an
excessive amount of reactants to achieve the complete conver-
sion of oil to biodiesel. In order to make the process efficient and
less reactant consuming, a rational integration process of reac-
tant recovery is required.

P(5) Global reaction steps for supercritical biodiesel production using
methanol, ethanol, methyl acetate, DMC, and MTBE have been
alluded. However, there is still a need for understanding the
detailed reaction mechanisms and models for reactor scaling up
purpose.

7. Concluding remarks

PBiodiesel production processes are reviewed in this paper. It is
shown that supercritical biodiesel production offers many advantages
over conventional methods, including large reaction rate, no catalyst
requirement, and insensitivity to feedstock. Economical and technical
hurdles remain but significant progress has been made through
experiments with various reactants such as methanol, ethanol,
methyl acetate, DMC, and MTBE in a variety of reactor types, includ-
ing batch-type reactor, continuous flow reactor, and spiral reactor.
Reaction rates for biodiesel production in supercritical methanol, eth-
anol, methyl acetate, DMC, and MTBE were compared for the first
time in this review. Overall activation energies of 17.2, 80.7, 278.2,
60.2, and 82.6 kJ/mol were determined for biodiesel production in
supercritical methanol, ethanol, methyl acetate, DMC, and MTBE,
respectively, assuming pseudo first-order reaction kinetics.
