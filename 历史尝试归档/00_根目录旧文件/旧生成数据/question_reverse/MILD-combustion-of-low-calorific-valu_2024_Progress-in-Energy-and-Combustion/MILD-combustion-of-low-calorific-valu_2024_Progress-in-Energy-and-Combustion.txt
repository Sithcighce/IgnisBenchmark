The utilization of low calorific value gases (LCVG) in combustion devices presents particular challenges in terms
of ignition and sustained combustion stability due to the presence of non-combustible components. Moderate or
intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion has emerged as a promising technology for LCVG combustion,
offering numerous advantages such as high combustion efficiency, reduced pollutant emissions, and increased
fuel flexibility. However, the current body of research in this area is fragmented, making it challenging to draw
meaningful  comparisons  between  studies  and  hindering  its  practical  application.  This  paper  provides  a
comprehensive review of conventional and MILD combustion of LCVG. To understand the impact of composition
on  combustion,  the  fuels  are  classified  based  on  their  composition  of  hydrogen,  carbon  monoxide,  methane,
carbon  dioxide,  nitrogen,  and  water.  We  also  delve  into  the  chemical  and  physical  effects  of  composition,
including reaction kinetics and turbulence mixing, and provide an overview of the burners and methods used in
establishing MILD combustion. Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and chemical kinetics
in MILD combustion are also thoroughly discussed.

The presence of a large amount of dilution gas in LCVG increases the self-ignition temperature and ignition
delay time of the mixture, making preheating the reactants a critical consideration. In MILD combustion, it is
crucial to have an inlet reactant temperature higher than the self-ignition temperature (Tin > Tsi) to mitigate the
difficulties associated with ignition and unstable combustion. The heat release in MILD combustion should be
moderate to ensure that the combustion temperature does not become too high. The non-combustible compo-
nents of LCVG are beneficial in this regard, as they allow for a temperature increase of less than the self-ignition
temperature (ΔT < Tsi). Hydrogen is the most reactive component in LCVG, and its content directly impacts the
establishment, efficiency, and pollutant emissions of MILD combustion. Carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water act
as diluents, helping to reduce NOx emissions in MILD combustion. Although a burner may have the potential to
be used for MILD combustion, it must be optimised for LCVG with variable composition in order to achieve the
lowest pollutant emissions. Further research is necessary to verify and improve simulation models and chemical
kinetics. This article provides theoretical support for the practical application of MILD combustion of LCVG with
variable composition.

1. Introduction

The advancement of human civilization is heavily reliant on the use
of fossil energy. However, the excessive use of fossil fuels is presenting
significant challenges to energy security, environmental sustainability,

and efforts to decrease carbon emissions. To address these challenges
and ensure a sustainable future energy solution, the development and
implementation  of  renewable  energy  sources  is  imperative.  Among
renewable energy sources, low calorific value gases (LCVG) generated
from  various  sources  have  gained  significant  attention  [1,2].  For
instance, the latest advancements in gas turbine based power generation

involve the utilization of LCVG [3]. LCVG encompasses a diverse range
of gases, including biogas, synthetic gas (syngas), coke oven gas (COG),
blast furnace gas (BFG), coal gasified gas (CGG), and biomass gasified
gas (BGG) or a combination of these gases. The primary components of
LCVG  may  include  CO,  H2,  CH4,  and  other  combustible  and
non-combustible elements, such as CO2  and N2. The presence of a sig-
nificant number of non-combustible components results in a reduction
of  the  calorific  value  of  the  gas.  Due  to  the  variability  of
non-combustible  components,  a  clear  definition  of  calorific  value  for

LCVG is lacking. In this review, CH4 is considered as the reference fuel,
and  gases with calorific values significantly lower than CH4  are  cate-
gorized as LCVG.

The primary source and generation technology of LCVG are shown in
Fig. 1. Biogas is one of the most widely used LCVG [4]. Biogas can be
produced from organic wastes or biomass by anaerobic digestion (AD) of
microorganisms [5]. As listed in Table 1 [6], the primary components of
biogas  are  CH4  and  CO2.  The  lower  heating  value  (LHV)  of  biogas  is
approximately  18–25  MJ/Nm3.  Syngas  can  be  produced  from  almost

any carbon source ranging from natural gas and oil products to coal and
biomass through oxidation with steam and oxygen [7]. As the oxidants
are steam and (or) oxygen, the proportion of CO and H2 in the syngas is
high. The LHV of syngas is approximately 10 MJ/Nm3. The composition
of  syngas  derived  from  the  gasification  of  two  types  of  Polish  coal  is
listed in Table 2 [8]. As a source of H2 and CO, syngas plays an important
role  in  the  chemical  industry,  such  as  Fischer–Tropsch  syntheses  for
ammonia production [7]; as an LCVG fuel, the combustion of syngas has
also  attracted  significant  attention  [9–12].  In  particular,  the  develop-
ment of an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power gen-
eration system has resulted in cleaner and more efficient utilization of
coal;  moreover,  this  technology  reduces  the  use  of  H2O,  which  has  a
significant advantage among similar power generation systems [13]. As
a renewable LCVG, BGG produced from the gasification of biomass has
the advantage of being CO2 neutral [14–16]. Air can be used as a gasi-
fication agent to reduce the cost. BGG has more practical application
potential for biomass and organic wastes with low energy density. The
composition of BGG is complex. The primary combustible components
are CO, H2, and a small amount of CH4. The volume fraction (vol%) of
the non-combustible components such as CO2  and N2  can reach 80 %.
Table 3 lists the composition of BGG produced in typical fluidized bed
gasifiers.

The composition of LCVG is variable, which results from its various
raw materials and generation processes. The primary sources of LCVG
include  environmentally-friendly  biomass,  organic  waste,  and  clean
utilization  of  coal.  The  utilization  of  LCVG  not  only  provides  energy
benefits, but also environmental benefits. To effectively utilize LCVG, it
is  necessary  to  develop  clean  and  efficient  combustion  technologies.
However,  the  presence  of  a  significant  number  of  non-combustible
components and variability in the combustible components can impact
the basic fuel properties and, as a result, affect the combustion charac-
teristics, such as LHV [14], flame temperature [14], flammability limits
[20],  laminar  burning  velocities  [21],  self-ignition  temperature  [22],
ignition delay time [23], chemical kinetics [24], and flame stability [25,
26]. Furthermore, these variations in basic characteristics can lead to
challenges such as difficulty in the ignition [27], combustion instability
(CI) [28], low combustion efficiency [29], and high pollutant emissions
[29].  Industrial  combustion  devices  like  gas  turbine  engines,  internal
combustion  engines,  hot  air  heaters,  built-in  combustion  chambers,
offset  flame  burners,  and  more  have  been  developed  for  in  situ  com-
bustion  applications.  However,  when  it  comes  to  the  combustion  of
LCVG, such as COG, BFG, CGG, and BGG, these systems are susceptible
to high combustion instability, low combustion efficiency, and narrow
flammable range [30–32]. Eriksson et al. [32] designed a burner for the
Volvo VT4400 industrial gas turbine, which is used to combust BGG. The
burner was specifically engineered to operate under stoichiometric/lean
conditions and was capable of handling thermal inputs of up to 2.1 MW.

However, due to the low combustion efficiency and the limited flam-
mable range of BGG, it was necessary to co-fire BGG with natural gas in
order to facilitate engine start-up and ensure stable operation, particu-
larly at low loads. Zhang et al. [30] examined the occurrence of com-
bustion  instability in  hot air heaters during  the combustion  of LCVG,
especially at elevated ambient temperatures. This instability can result
in adverse effects, including vibrations in the heater body and fluctua-
tions in outlet parameters. Such combustion instability can significantly
affect the overall performance and reliability of industrial processes.

Moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion [33] is
a novel concept that has recently evolved and is gaining popularity due
to  its  high  combustion  efficiency  and  low  pollutant  emissions.  The
positive outcomes arise from the conditions established by MILD com-
bustion,  characterized  by  high  initial  temperatures  and  low  oxygen
concentrations. These conditions offer simultaneous benefits, including
improved combustion stability and reduced emissions of CO and NOx.
Importantly, these established conditions and advantages do not vary
when the composition of LCVG changes. This underscores the robustness
and  reliability  of  MILD  combustion  as  a  solution  for  handling  LCVG
across  different  compositions.  The  concept  of  MILD  combustion  is
derived from high-temperature air combustion [34], and it is achieved
by preheating air and supplying it at high speed with strong exhaust gas
recirculation (EGR). This results in a flameless combustion (FC) condi-
tion  [35].  Khalil  and  Gupta  proposed  a  novel  method  for  generating
MILD  combustion,  referred  to  as  “colourless  distributed  combustion
(CDC)”, through the use of swirling flow fields [36–38].

MILD combustion, FC, and CDC are combustion regimes that share a
common principle, despite their differences in scope and implementa-
tion  methods.  This  principle  is  the  utilization  of  strong  turbulence
mixing to  achieve  low  emissions  and  high combustion efficiency.  For
example, the defining feature of FC is the presence of an invisible flame.
Figs.  2  and  3  show  photographs  of  “invisible  flame”  of  respectively
premixed and non-premixed flameless combustion [39,40]. To achieve
FC,  dilution  of  the  fuel-air  mixture  and  high-intensity  turbulence  are
crucial, while air preheating is not necessarily required [41].

Essential characteristics of CDC are shown schematically in Fig. 4: (a)
a higher thermal intensity of CDC will result in a smaller volume of the
combustor; (b) the existence of hot burned gas (‘B’) and its fast mixing

as  shown  in  Fig.  4d.  Specifically,  in  their  laboratory-scale  burner,
swirling was used to stabilize the flame and enhance the uniformity of
mixing.  Air  preheating  and  reducing  oxygen  concentration  were  also
used.

Cavaliere  and  de  Joannon  [33]  proposed  a  definition  for  MILD
combustion, which imposes the condition that the temperature of the
reactant mixture at the inlet (Tin) be above the self-ignition temperature
(Tsi).  In  contrast,  the  maximum  temperature  rise  (ΔT)  due  to  heat
release has to be lower than the self-ignition temperature. This implies
that ΔT < Tsi < Tin. Tin > Tsi  is usually achieved by air preheating
[43], exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) [44], or jet-in-hot-coflow (JHC)
[45]. ΔT < Tsi  can be achieved through oxidant dilution [46–48] and
EGR  [49,50].  A  zero-dimensional  analysis  of  a  well-stirred  reactor
(WSR) showed that with the increase in dilution level, the oxygen con-
centration in the reaction zone decreases and the temperature rise de-
creases accordingly [22]. Conversely, the condition of Tin > Tsi ensures
complete combustion of the fuel while reducing the ignition delay time
so  that  the  fuel/oxidizer  mixture  has  sufficient  time  to  undergo  the
process  of  self-ignition  and  combustion.  Therefore,  the  fuel  can  be
burned entirely, CO and unburned hydrocarbons (UHCs) emissions can
be significantly low, and high-efficiency combustion can be achieved. In
contrast,  ΔT < Tsi  ensures  that  the  overall  combustion  temperature
decreases  and  avoids  the  local  high-temperature  zone  to  introduce  a
strong suppression of thermal NOx generation. Consequently, the final
NOx emission  can be lower  than ten  ppm, thus achieving  clean com-
bustion.  By  significantly  diluting  the  reactants and  reducing  the  tem-
perature, fuel-NOx is also inhibited.

The  discussion  above  indicates  a  favourable  strategy  for  MILD
combustion of LCVG. For LCVG, the ignition delay time is long, and the
self-ignition temperature is high; thus, the conditions that Tin > Tsi  is
needed.  LCVG  have  several  non-combustible  components,  which  is
directly  in  line  with  the  dilution  condition  of  MILD  combustion.
Therefore, the ΔT < Tsi  condition is easy to ensure. The MILD regime
requires a  precise and unified definition to guide the research on the
subject. For LCVG, the definition of “MILD combustion” of Cavaliere and
de Joannon [33] is more appropriate. It will be discussed in detail in
Section 4.1.

Studies have confirmed that LCVG are suitable for MILD combustion.
Research  has  shown  that  using  LCVG  in  MILD  combustion  results  in
lower pollutant emissions, as demonstrated in multiple works [43,49].
However,  due  to  the  varying  composition  of  LCVG,  realizing  MILD
combustion under different conditions often requires different burners
and methods. This makes it challenging to compare the results of these
studies, which hinders a deeper understanding and practical application
of LCVG MILD combustion. It is important to note that even if a specific
type of burner has the potential to achieve MILD combustion, it will only
result  in  the  lowest  pollutant  emissions  under  appropriate  conditions
[11]. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the impact of different LCVG
compositions  on  the  establishment  and  characteristics  of  MILD
combustion.

In the present review, an analysis method of LCVG MILD combustion
with different compositions is presented as shown in Fig. 5. The main
components  of  LCVG  shown  in  the  figure  include  CH4,  H2,  CO,  CO2,
H2O, and N2. The mixture of CH4 and H2 is referred to as an H2-rich gas.
The energy density per volume (or LHV on a volume basis) of H2-rich gas
is lower than that of CH4  owing to the addition of H2  that has a lower
density. In principle, the influence of H2 on MILD combustion of LCVG
can be analysed through the H2-rich gas. MILD combustion of the gas
mixture with CO and H2  is of paramount importance, as they are the
elemental compositions of COG, BFG, CGG, and BGG. Biogas is a mixture
of  CH4/CO2.  A  study  of  MILD  combustion  of  biogas  can  identify  the
effect of the dilution component CO2. Further, several researchers have
used N2 and H2O as diluents; therefore, the impact of the three diluents
on MILD combustion is analysed. As the composition of CGG and BGG
are the most complex ones in actual LCVG, the influence of its compo-
nent on MILD combustion was analysed based on results of H2-rich gas,

with  air  (‘A’)  will  result  in  a  high  temperature  and  low  oxygen  con-
centration in the oxidizer (‘O’); (c) the separation of air (‘A’) and fuel

scalar dissipation rate making the combustion stable and on the other
hand decrease the combustion temperature due to burned gas dilution to
the reactants, thus making the combustion process CDC; (d) both for-
ward flow and reverse flow configurations can be used to establish CDC,

2.1. Lower heating value and flame temperature

The heating value is one of the most critical parameters of LCVG as
fuels, which directly reflects the practical value of the gases. In practical
applications, LHV is more relevant than the higher heating value (HHV)
because it is challenging to utilize the latent heat of vaporisation. The
volumetric heating value may be more important for gases due to gas
transmission pipelines and equipment limitations.

The  LHV  of  the  three  components  of  LCVG  listed  in  Table  4  is

calculated from its combustible components according to

∑

LHVmixture =

xiLHVi,

(1)

where  xi  represents  the  volume  fraction  of  the  i-th  combustible
component of LCVG; LHVi  represents the LHV of the component.

The LHVs of the various LCVG listed in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 5
are also calculated using this method. It must be noted that LHV does not
reflect  the  entire  practical  value  of  LCVG;  the  adiabatic  combustion
temperature  is  another  critical  parameter.  Tad,V  and  Tad,P  in  Table  4
represent  the  adiabatic  combustion  temperatures  in  isobaric  and  iso-
choric  combustion  processes,  respectively.  It  can  be  observed  that,
although the LHV of CH4 is significantly higher than that of CO and H2,
Tad,P of stoichiometric CH4/air flame is lower than that of CO or H2. With
different compositions in LCVG, to maintain the same MILD combustion
temperature, extra air preheating temperatures or ERG have to be used.

syngas and biogas. It is recognized that although the fuel composition
plays  a  very  important  role  in  LCVG  MILD  combustion,  turbulence
mixing  and  heat  transfer  are  also  important  since  the  preheated  air
mixing with the fuel and EGR is governed by the convective and diffu-
sive transport of heat and mass. The combustible components of LCVG
have a direct chemical effect, while the dilution components are in effect
through  turbulence  mixing  and  heat  transfer.  Unlike  in  conventional
combustion, the interaction between chemical reactions and heat/mass
transfer plays a different role in MILD combustion of LCVG, due to the
difference in the reaction zone structures.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:
In  Section 2,  the fundamental  characteristics of  LCVG as  fuels are
outlined, covering their lower heating value, flame temperature, flam-
mability limits, burning velocities, and extinction strain rate. This sec-
tion  concludes  with  a  discussion  of  the  challenges  and  impact  of  the
basic  combustion  properties  of  LCVG  on  combustion  performance,
including  ignition,  combustion  intensity  (CI),  combustion  efficiency,
and pollutant emissions.

Section  3  provides  an  overview  of  various  definitions  of  MILD
combustion and presents a survey of different MILD burners for LCVG
combustion,  including  the  design  of  MILD  burners  for  LCVG  and
established  methods  for  achieving  this  combustion  regime.  Section  4
focuses on experimental studies of LCVG MILD combustion, detailing the
effects  of  four  types  of  LCVG  on  MILD  combustion.  In  Section  5,  the
utilization of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and chemical
kinetics mechanisms in studying MILD combustion is explored. Finally,
Section 6 presents conclusions and future research questions on MILD
combustion of LCVG.

With  the  increasing  use  of  LCVG  as  fuels,  it  is  expected  that  the
composition variations of LCVG will become even more complex and the
range  of  their applications  will  expand.  This  review aims  to  not only
provide a clear definition and understanding of LCVG MILD combustion
but also offer guidance for future research in this field. By examining the
fundamental characteristics of LCVG, the impact of these characteristics
on  combustion  performance,  and  the  methods  for  establishing  MILD
combustion, we hope to contribute to the advancement of knowledge
and the development of more effective and efficient LCVG MILD com-
bustion systems.

2. Characterisation of LCVG as fuels

2.2. Flammability limits

The focus of this paper is the application of LCVG as fuels, although
there  have  been  numerous  studies  investigating  the  feasibility  of  uti-
lizing syngas as a feedstock for chemical synthesis [51,52]. Crucial fuel
attributes encompass density, LHV, flammability limits, burning veloc-
ities,  extinction  strain  rates,  and  ignition  temperature,  among  others.
Table 4 and Table 5 present the fundamental characteristics of H2, CO,
and CH4 [53] and four types of LCVG, respectively. Table 5 includes data
on the composition, LHV, laminar burning velocity (SL), and adiabatic

Experiments show that the flame can propagate if the mixture is in a
specific concentration range between the upper flammability limit (UFL)
and lower flammability limit (LFL). The UFL and LFL for CO, H2, and
CH4 are listed in Table 4. The flammability limits are characteristics of
fuels and depend on the composition of the gases, mixture temperature
and pressure, etc. For LCVG, the flammability limits may be estimated
using the Le Chatelier rule  [20,57] from its combustible  components.
Recently, many studies extended and modified the Le Chatelier rule, and
new  methods  were  proposed  to  calculate  the  flammability  limits  of

mixtures  from  different  perspectives  [58–60].  Pizzuti  et  al.  [61]
reviewed the flammability limits of biogas (CH4/CO2). The conclusion is
that the presence of CO2 in biogas significantly reduces the flammability
limits  of  the  mixture.  The  flammability  limits  of  biogas  are  narrower
than that of pure CH4 or natural gas. Yi-Shih et al. performed extensive
computations to determine the flammability limits of opposed jet H2/CO
syngas  flames  [62].  The  flammability  limits  of  different  oxygen  con-
centrations and dilution level in the air with the change in the strain rate
(radial velocity gradient on the fuel side) were computed as shown in
Figs. 6 and 7. It is clear that the increase in the H2/CO ratio enhances the
flammability.  However,  the  diluents  in  the  oxidizer  and  the  dilution
level have more remarkable impact on the flammability. This result is
important because the low oxygen levels of MILD combustion are often
achieved by adding dilution gases or lowering the oxygen concentration
in the air.

Wang et al. [63] measured the LFL of the H2/CO/O2/N2/H2O mix-
tures in a spherical container. The authors showed that in the presence
of oxygen or H2O, LFL decreased as the H2 content in syngas increased.
When the H2  content was lower than 20 %, the LFL dropped rapidly.
When the N2 concentration was below 60 %, the addition of N2 did not
affect the LFL of the mixture. When N2  concentration increased above
60 %, the dilution effect began to dominate the reaction system, and LFL
increased with N2 concentration. Shang et al. [64] investigated the LFL
of the H2/CO/air mixtures under N2  and CO2  dilution conditions. The
experimental results show that LFL decreases with increased H2 content,
especially  when  the  H2  content  is  lower  (molar  fraction  of  H2  in  the
H2/CO mixture <0.25). As the generation of OH in the H2/oxygen re-
action  accelerates  the  oxidation  of  CO,  the  Le  Chatelier  rule  over-
estimates the LFL of the H2/CO mixture with a small amount of H2. As
CO2 has a larger heat capacity than N2, it has an inhibitory effect on the
oxidation of CO and the generation of H radicals; therefore, CO2  has a
more substantial dilution effect on LFL.

It  is  worth  mentioning  that  the  flammability  limits  are  a  strong
function of the mixture temperature but a weak function of the pressure.
Therefore, most studies have focused on the influence of temperature.
Schoor et al. [65] identified that the UFL of the H2/CO/N2/air mixture
increased  linearly  by  approximately  3.2  mol%  when  the  temperature

the flammability limits of CH4-air-diluent mixtures based on the detailed
kinetic mechanism at ultra-low temperatures. The flammability limits

strain  rates  and  dilution  gas  percentages  for  equal-molar  syngas.  Reprinted

are calculated based on the theory of ultimate combustion rate and the
detailed  kinetic  mechanism.  The  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.  An
important rule can be identified: with the increase in the diluent con-
centration  and  decrease  in  the  initial  temperature,  the  LFL  value  in-
creases,  while  the  UFL  value  decreases,  and  the  combustible  zone
becomes narrower. The LFL is a weak function of the diluent concen-
tration, while the UFL is a strong function of the diluent concentration.
Heat loss from flames to the cold environment significantly impacts
flammability  limits.  Comparatively,  radiative  heat  loss  could  have  a
more significant impact on flammability than convective or conductive
heat losses when the flame is not near the cold walls. The actual impact
of heat loss depends on the flame configuration and mixture conditions.
Radiative heat loss affects flammability through different mechanisms.
First,  radiative  heat  loss  from  the  reaction  zone  to  the  cold  envi-
ronment suppresses flammability, especially when the flame is close to
its  flammability  limits.  Under  this  condition,  the  ratio  of  blackbody
emissive  power  to  the  heat  release  rate,  known  as  the  Boltzmann

number, is higher than that of stoichiometric flames [67].

Second, radiative heat transfers from the hot gas downstream of the
reaction  zone  decrease  the  temperature  in  the  post-flame  region,
creating a negative temperature gradient from the reaction zone to the
post-flame zone. This decrease in flame temperature narrows the flam-
mability limits [68]. Jeon et al. [69] conducted numerical simulations of
H2/CO2/H2O-air flame under fuel-lean conditions to analyze the impact
of radiation heat loss on LFL, confirming the influence of direct radiation
heat  loss  in  the  reaction  zone  and  indirect  radiation  heat  loss  in  the
post-flame zone on the flammability limits.

Third, reabsorption of radiation in the unburned gas can increase the
flammability  limits  [61,67,70].  This  mechanism  is  highly  relevant  to
LCVG flames, due to the presence of species that can absorb radiation (e.
g., CO2) in the fuels. It is found that the radiation reabsorption mecha-
nism is highly dependent on the flame configuration, and increasing the
combustor pressure augments the effect of radiation reabsorption [70].

2.3. Burning velocities

The  flame  propagation  determines  the  location  of  the  flame  in  a
combustion  chamber  and  flame  stabilisation  characteristics  such  as
blow-off  and  flashback.  Laminar  burning  velocity  characterizes  the
flame  propagation  under  idealized  planar  unstretched  and  adiabatic
laminar  flame  conditions.  It  is  an  essential  parameter  in  validating
chemical kinetic mechanisms and modelling turbulent flames and tur-
bulent  burning velocities.  Thus,  studying  laminar  flames  and  laminar
burning  velocities  is  important.  Table  4  lists  the  maximum  laminar
burning  velocities  of  CO,  H2,  and  CH4  in  the  air.  Under  atmospheric
pressure  and  room  temperature  conditions,  the  maximum  laminar
burning velocity of CH4 in the air is 37 cm/s, and the maximum laminar
burning velocity of CO in the air is 19 cm/s, significantly lower than that
of  CH4.  For  H2,  the  maximum  laminar  burning  velocity  in  the  air  is
considerably higher, i.e., 289 cm/s [53]. Thus, for LCVG, the laminar
burning velocities strongly depend on the composition.

The laminar burning velocities of H2-rich gases have been the focus
of  various  investigations.  Attia  et  al.  [71]  studied  the  combustion  of
G222  (a  mixture  of  CH4/H2  with  77/23  vol%  ratio,  LHV  = 30.1
MJ/Nm3)  and  identified  that  increasing  H2  in  the  fuel  mixture  could
improve the laminar burning velocities. Wang et al. [72] found that in a
CH4/H2 spherical flame, the dilution effect of CO2 reduced the laminar
burning velocity. The dilution effects can be divided into physical effects
caused  by  the  changes  in  the  physical properties  of the  mixtures  and
chemical effects caused by the reactivity of diluents. The physical effect
of CO2  plays a leading role, while chemical effects always amplify the
influence,  except  in  the  Markstein  length.  It  slightly  increases  the
Markstein  length  of  CH4  flame  with  increasing  dilution  fraction,  but
firstly decreases then increases the Markstein length of H2 flame due to
the combined effects of mixture reactivity and density ratio.

The  laminar  burning  velocities  of  syngas  were  also  intensively
studied. Natarajan et al. [56] measured the laminar burning velocities of
a  lean  H2/CO/CO2  mixture.  Two  methods  were  used:  Bunsen  flame
method  based  on  flame  area  images  of  a  conical  Bunsen  flame  and
stagnation flame method based on flame-front velocity measurements in
a one-dimensional stagnation flame. It was shown that the Bunsen flame
method shows moderately accurate results for a wide range of H2/CO
compositions.  Fig.  9  shows  the  comparison  of  the  measurements  ob-
tained by Natarajan et al., together with other experiments. When the
equivalence ratio is 1, the laminar burning velocity of the SG-50 (syngas
1 in Table 5) is 112 cm/s, which shows a difference of not more than 5 %
when  compared  to  the  experimental  results  of  other  researchers
[73–75];  further,  the  laminar  burning  velocity  of  the  syngas  2  is  33
cm/s, with a difference of not more than 10 % in comparison with other
experimental  results.  The  effects  of  CO2  on  the  results  are  shown  in
Fig.  10.  CO2  can reduce  the  laminar  burning velocity of  the  mixture.
When the equivalence ratio is 1, the laminar burning velocities of the
syngas SG-50 decrease from 112 cm/s to 82 cm/s when the CO2 dilution

increased from 0 to 20 %. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 11, the increase
in preheating temperature results in an evident rise in laminar burning
velocities. This result is helpful for the MILD combustion of LCVG.

To  investigate  the  actual  laminar  burning  velocities  of  LCVG,  nu-
merical simulations were conducted for biogas, syngas, and BGG with
different  compositions  using  detailed  chemical  reaction  mechanisms
[14,76],  taking  into  account  the  variations  of  the  composition.  For
syngas,  the  laminar  burning  velocities  decreased  by  a  factor  of  three
when  the  CO  content  increased  from  50  %  (SG-50)  to  95  %  (SG-5),
Fig. 12a. For biogas, i.e., a mixture of CH4/CO2, the laminar burning
velocities  decreased  monotonically  with  the  increase  in  CO2  content,
Fig. 12b.

Table 5 summarised the laminar burning velocities of several BGGs
at the equivalence ratio of one. The laminar burning velocities of three
types of BGGs in a range of equivalent ratios and H2  content at atmo-
spheric pressure were measured using a heat flux method in a porous
plate burner [77]. The compositions of the three types of BGGs are listed
in  Table  6,  and  the  experimental  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  13.  The
laminar burning velocities calculated using GRI-Mech 3.0 and GRI-Mech
2.11 are comparable to the experimental data.

Using  an  externally  heated  diverging  channel  method,  Varghese
et al. [21] measured the laminar burning velocities of nine LCVG fuels
with different compositions and elevated temperatures (350–650 K) for
various  equivalence  ratios.  Based  on  sensitivity  analysis  and  experi-
mental data verification, two linear models of laminar burning velocity
concerning compositions were proposed, as illustrated in Eqs. (3) and
(4) below. These models quantitatively describe the contribution of H2,
CO,  and  CH4  to  the  laminar  burning  velocity.  The  correlation  co-
efficients are also consistent with the laminar burning velocities of CO,
H2, and CH4. From Eqs. (3) and (4), it is clear that both CO2 and N2 can
reduce the laminar burning velocity of LCVG, and the effect of CO2  is
more significant. The two models have good accuracy in the following
< 0.13, 0 < XCO2
< 0.50, 0.08 < XCO < 0.50, 0 < XCH4
ranges: 0.05 < XH2
< 0.50,0 < XN2
< 0.65, 0.7 < φ < 1.25, 300 K < Tu < 600 K. When the
volume concentration of H2 exceeds 50 %, the prediction error is higher
(25–45 %). The inferior prediction of the H2-rich mixture is due to the
changes in chemical kinetics, i.e., when the CO content becomes low, the
flame behaviour is similar to that of a pure H2 flame.

Recently, Xie et al. [78] investigated the effect of CO on the laminar
burning velocity of BGG. The authors reported that the effect could be
divided into two stages according to the level of CO, and the cut-off point
is the mole fraction of CO of 0.85. When the CO content is lower than
this  threshold  value,  the  sensitivity  coefficient  of  the  most  important
rate-controlling reaction OH + CO = H + CO2 increases with the addi-
tion of CO, showing a quasi-linear change of laminar burning velocity
with CO level. At high CO levels, the laminar burning velocity of BGG is
a  non-linear  function  of  CO  mole  fraction.  For  an  actual  BGG,  it  is
difficult for CO to reach a volume fraction of 0.85.

Zhou et al. [12] studied the influence of composition on the laminar
burning velocities  of H2/CO/CH4  flames. With  the  increase in  the  H2
content in fuel, the laminar burning velocities increased significantly,
while for the CH4-rich flame, the laminar burning velocities were lower.
With  the  increase  in  the  CO  content,  the  laminar  burning  velocities
changed marginally. The thermodynamic and chemical kinetic analyses
showed that the addition of CO had a greater influence on the adiabatic
flame temperature; however, this influence was less than that caused by
adding H2.

Varghese et al. [79] used a machine learning model to predict the
laminar burning velocities of the H2/CO/CH4/CO2/N2/air mixtures. The
developed model is suitable for LCVG and performs significantly well
without  solving  detailed  governing  equations  and  detailed  chemical
kinetics and transport properties. The model, shown in Eq. (5), applies to
various LCVG-air mixtures reported in the literature.  A detailed com-
parison shows that the empirical model can predict the laminar burning
velocity with an error of less than 10 %. The scope of application con-
siders  the  following  ranges:  0.25  < XH2

Owing to the complexity of turbulence/chemistry interaction, there
is a lack of relevant research on the turbulent burning velocities of LCVG
at present. A few researchers studied the turbulent burning velocities of
H2-rich LCVG.  Cai et  al.  [80] studied the influence of  effective  Lewis
number(Leff
on  the  turbulence  burning  velocities  in  the  CH4/H2
(20/80-80/20)  mixture  in  an  expanding  flame  configuration.  The  re-
sults, modelled using Eqs. (6) and (7), showed that the normalised tur-
bulence burning velocity ST/SL  was proportional to the turbulent flame
Reynolds number ReT,f. Using Leff  and ReT,f, a modified general corre-
lation  of  turbulent  burning  velocities  was  obtained.  This  correlation
could predict the existing experimental data and the turbulent burning
velocities  measured  in  the  turbulent  Bunsen  flame  and  high-pressure
expanding flame configurations.

Lin et al. [81] measured the turbulent burning velocity of H2-rich
syngas under a gas turbine engine condition (Tu = 623 K, p = 2.0 MPa).
Fig.  14  shows  the  relationship  between  the  normalised  turbulent
burning velocity (ST/SL0, where SL0 is the unstretched laminar burning
velocity)  and  the  normalised  turbulence  intensity  (u′/SL0)  while
considering the influence of the composition on the turbulent burning

velocities.  The  profiles  of  ST/SL0  overlap  fairly  well  for  the  H2-rich
syngas containing 70–100 % H2. For the H2/N2 gas flames, N2 dilution
affects the burning velocities by reducing the flame temperature. The 50
%  H2  syngas  flame  shows  a  higher  ST/SL0.  The  length  of  this  syngas
flame is longer than that of the H2-rich flame, even though they have the
same SL0  value. The effect of pressure and preheating temperature on
turbulent burning velocity can be expressed by ST/SL0=(P0/PR)0.84 and
ST/SL0=(T0/TR)

2.4. Extinction strain rates

Vagelopoulos  and  Egolfopoulos  [82]  investigated  the  effect  of
hydrogen and methane addition on the propagation and extinction of
atmospheric CO/air flames experimentally and numerically. As shown
+ XCO
in Fig. 15, the extinction strain rate (Kext) decreases as both XH2
+ XCO  reduction
and XH2  decrease, which is reasonable since the XH2
leads to fuel-leaner, weaker mixtures, and the XH2  reduction leads to a
lower concentration of OH radicals and thus a lower rate of the key heat
release reaction CO + OH = CO2 + H, which in turn results in a lower
heat  release  rate  and  a  lower  flame  resistance  to  extinction.  Fig.  16
shows similar results of Kext for the CO/CH4/air mixtures. Kext decreases
+ XCO  and XCH4  decrease, which is attributed to that the
as both XCH4
+ XCO reduction leads to fuel-leaner, weaker mixtures, and the XCH4
XCH4
+ XCO  values, leads to a lower rate of the key
reduction, for fixed XCH4
reaction CO + OH = CO2 + H and, therefore, a lower heat release rate.
As a conclusion, the addition of small amounts of hydrogen and methane

K, equivalence ratios φ = 1.0–1.5, and an initial pressure of 20 atm. The
results  showed  that the  addition  of  H2  gas  had  a  minor  effect  on  the
ignition delay time at low temperatures (T < 950 K); however, it could
significantly shorten the ignition delay time at high temperatures (T >
950  K).  CO  had  a  minor  effect  on  the  ignition  delay  time  under  all
studied conditions. Gersen et al. [84] also demonstrated that the addi-
tion of CO to a mixture with a high concentration of H2 (>50 %) would
not significantly increase the ignition delay time. Krejci et al. [85] re-
ported that although only 5 % H2 was present in the fuel mixture, H2 was
far  more  reactive  than  CO  and  promoted  the  ignition  of  the  syngas
mixture.

Walton et al. [86] studied the ignition of H2/CO/O2/N2/CO2  mix-
tures  using  a  rapid  compression  machine.  The  conditions  considered
were:  initial  pressures  p  = 7.1–26.4  atm,  initial  temperatures  T  =
855–1051  K,  equivalence  ratios  φ  = 0.1–1.0,  oxygen  mole  fractions
= 0.15–0.20,  and  H2/CO  mole  ratios  of  0.25–4.0.  An  empirical
XO2
function of ignition delay time was obtained through regression analysis
and illustrated in Eq. (8). This function ignored the effect of the H2/CO
ratio  variation  from  0.25  to  4.0,  and  the  overall  uncertainty  was
approximately 30 %.

where  τign  is  the  ignition  delay  time  [ms]  and  R  is  the  universal  gas
constant  [cal/mole/K].  It  is  evident  that  the  ignition  delay  time  de-
creases with increasing equivalence ratio, initial temperature, pressure,
and oxygen mole fraction in the mixture. Among these parameters, the
initial temperature and oxygen mole fraction have the most significant
impact on the ignition delay time.

Several researchers have explored the effect of CH4 on the ignition of
LCVG  mixtures.  Generally,  adding  CH4  to  a  syngas  (CO/H2)  mixture
increases  the  ignition  delay  time  of  the  mixtures  [10,84].  This  effect
occurs due to the reaction CH4 + OH = CH4 + H2O, which consumes OH
radicals. However, the impact of CH4 addition is sensitive to the initial
temperatures and pressures. Mathieu et al. [10] found that at low initial
pressures (1.6 atm), an addition of CH4 tended to increase the ignition
delay times below 1230 K. At high initial pressures (32 atm), the addi-
tion of CH4 showed an inhibiting effect on ignition delay times, but this
effect  was  visible  only  for  temperatures  above  about  1220  K.  This
complex  impact  of  CH4  addition  results  from  the  interaction  of
radicals-related  reactions  [10].  Literature-reported  studies  conducted
for  different  parameters  have  shown  contradictory  impacts  on  the
ignition  of  LCVG,  leading  to  significant  difficulties  in  reconciling  the
literature results.

2.5.2. Combustion instability

The  instability  of  LCVG  combustion  is  primarily  due  to  the  large
amount of CO2  and N2. As mentioned earlier, N2  and CO2  reduce the
LHV, the adiabatic flame temperature, the range of flammability limits,
and the laminar burning velocity. Therefore, the combustion process is
less  stable.  Wang  et  al.  [72]  showed  that  the  dilution  effect  of  CO2
reduced the maximum pressure and laminar burning velocity and pro-
longed the combustion duration in CH4/air and H2/air spherical flames.

to  CO  flames  increases  the  Kext  by  accelerating  the  CO  oxidation
reaction.

Sahu et al. [83] used particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) to determine
the  local  extinction  strain  rates  of  counterflow  CO/H2/CH4/N2  gas
flames (which are referred to as BGG flames in the present review) under
premixed and non-premixed flame conditions; the results are shown in
Table 7. The local and global extinction strain rate of 20:20H2/CO gas
(LHV = 4.7 MJ/Nm3) was shown to be considerably larger than that of
5:35H2/CO gas ((LHV = 4.4 MJ/Nm3). It was shown that the increase of
H2 leads to increased concentrations of radicals H, OH, and O, making
the flame more resistant to quenching at high strain rates. It was shown
that for non-premixed flames, a higher H2 concentration in the fuel gives
rise to a higher preferential diffusivity and reactivity of the fuel, which
was  found  to  result  in  the  localization  of  specific  key  reactions  in
non-premixed flames. This can affect the local extinction strain rates.

Ignition

The ignition delay time is a direct indication of the reactivity of the
fuel and a proper parameter that defines the time scale of chemical re-
actions, which can affect the performance of combustion devices such as
internal combustion engines. For example, a short local ignition delay
time in spark-ignition engines can cause pre-ignition of the charge and
knock, thus causing physical damage to the engines. Fuel composition
and operating conditions directly influence the ignition delay time.

Liu  et  al.  [27]  studied  the  effects  of  H2  and  CO  on  CH4  ignition
characteristics in a rapid compression machine, for a mixture of CH4 and
H2 (80/20 mol ratio) and mixture of CH4 and CO (80/20 mol ratio). The
experiments were conducted under initial temperatures T = 860–1080

The  reduction  in  maximum  combustion  pressure  can  be  attributed  to
chemical effects, i.e., the reduction in temperature because of the dilu-
tion  effect and the chemical effect of CO2  decomposition in the com-
bustion  zone.  As  the  burning  velocity  decreases,  the  combustion
duration is extended. It is also found that CO2 dilution will increase the
Markstein  length  of  the  CH4/air  flame;  however,  it  will  reduce  the
Markstein length of the H2/air flame. Thus, CO2 dilution has a tendency
to stabilize the CH4/air flame but it reduces the stability of the H2/air
flame.

Lee  et  al.  [53,87]  studied  the  combustion  instability  (CI)  of
H2/CO/CH4  flames  in  a  partially  premixed  gas  turbine  combustors,
focusing on the influence of the compositions of LCVG. A spatiotemporal
Rayleigh index (RI) analysis showed that the fuel composition affects the
location and intensity of CI driving/damping [28], RI frequency, and CI
mode and frequency. For the higher H2-containing flame, driving and
damping occurred in a narrow region with a high heat-release density,
and the RI frequency doubled. It is worth mentioning that the effect of
calorific value on CI is related to the composition, but there is no linear
relationship. Fig. 17 illustrates the heating values and the corresponding
Root Mean Square (RMS) of pressure fluctuations for H2/CO/CH4 mix-
tures with varying compositions. The aggregation of combustion insta-
bility  occurrences  in  the  middle  of  the  H2  lines  suggests  that  the  H2
content has a more significant impact than the calorific value. In other
words,  CI  cannot  be  analysed  solely  based  on  calorific  value;  it  is
contingent upon the specific composition.

Park et al. [53,88] analysed and characterized the impact of H2  on
the CI, burning velocity, and flame temperature of H2/CO/CH4  syngas
flames. The results demonstrated that the H2 content is the main reason
for the high-order instability mode and the shifting within CI modes, as
fast-burning H2  affects the chemical reaction time and flame tempera-
ture of syngas more than CO and CH4. Sensitivity studies have illustrated
that the change of combustion parameters is responsible for generating
high multi-mode flame oscillations, their frequencies, and mode shift-
ing.  It  is  expected  that  new  engine  operation  conditions  should  be
determined for new fuels with variable compositions, especially when
H2 is involved in the mixture.

Ren et al. [30,31,89,90] have conducted a comprehensive investi-
gation into the effects of LCVG composition and fuel blending on com-
bustion instability. Their research culminates in the proposal of optimal
fuel-switching  temperatures,  switching  schemes,  and  methods  for
inhibiting oscillating combustion to achieve stable combustion. These
approaches have the  effect of expanding the tolerance  range for flow
rate fluctuations by 10 % and 30 % when fuel switching schemes and
initial combustion states are chosen judiciously. Furthermore, they have
introduced a combustion state regulation method aimed at identifying
the optimal regulatory path for system parameters. This method proves
significant  in  the  context  of  stable  combustion  of  LCVG  in  industrial
burners.  To  streamline  the  regulatory  process,  the  active  subspace

method  was  employed  to  identify  the  active  direction,  effectively
reducing the number of regulatory steps required.

2.5.3. Combustion efficiency and pollutant emission

For the combustion of LCVG, the oxidation of fuels involving C and H
elements affects the combustion efficiency. Fuels with merely H element
(e.g.,  H2)  can  be  easily  oxidised  thus,  it  causes  less  problem  for  the
combustion  efficiency.  For  fuels  involving  C  element,  e.g.,  CO,  the
elementary  reaction  CO  + OH  →  CO2  + H  is  the  primary  oxidation
pathway, and most of the heat of C-bonds in the fuel is released in this
process. Therefore, the concentration of CO in the fuel mixture affects
directly the combustion efficiency. At the same time, NOx and CO are
the primary pollutants in LCVG combustion; therefore, this section pri-
marily considers the generation of CO and NOx. Some sources of LCVG,
such  as  CGG,  may  contain  the  sulphur  element,  which  also  produces
SOx. The sulphur-containing components may be removed by gas pu-
rification, so this article does not consider sulphur-containing species.
Attia et al. [71] compared the combustion of CH4, H2, and G222 (a
mixture of CH4/H2 with 77/23 vol% ratio). They found that adding H2
could reduce the emission of CO during combustion. Ziani et al. [91]
studied  the  CH4/H2  flames  using  the  chemical  reaction  mechanism
GRI-Mech 2.11. The results show that adding H2 can increase the com-
bustion temperature and the rate of NO generation. Further, the addition
of H2 leads to the reduction of CO and CO2 because the overall content of
C in the mixture is reduced by adding H2. Chuayboon et al. [92] studied
the combustion of CH4/H2/CO2 mixtures in a spark-ignition gas engine,
and  the  results are  shown in  Fig. 18.  The removal  of  CO2  in the  fuel
mixture  can  improve  the  brake  power  output  and  thermal  efficiency.
The maximum output power is 12.5 kW, which is 27.5 % higher than
without CO2  removal (9.8 kW). Under the condition of rich-fuel com-
bustion, the fuel mixture containing CO2  will lead to a higher specific
fuel consumption.

The  NOx  emission  in  LCVG  combustion  is  primarily  through  the
following  routes:  thermal,  prompt,  N2O-intermediate,  NNH,  and  NO-
reburning routes [93]. Wei et al. [94] studied the effect of H2 addition
on pollutant emissions in a biogas flame. Although adding H2  can in-
crease the generation of prompt NO, the rising trend of prompt NO is
notably weakened when the addition of H2 is more than 20 %, owing to
the decrease in the concentration of CH4. As H2  increases, the contri-
bution  of  prompt  NO  path  decreases  while  the  contribution  of  other
paths increases. Thus, the addition of H2 can increase the net production
of NO. Furthermore, the results showed that the high reactivity of H2
effectively inhibited the oxidation of CO by competing the consumption
of OH; therefore, the emission of CO was increased.

Joo  et  al.  [95]  studied  the  NOx  emission  characteristics  of
H2/CO/CH4  partially  premixed  combustion  using  an  artificial  neural
network model, and the results are shown in Fig. 19. It can be observed
that  the  increase  in  the  H2  content  can  cause  the  growth  of  NOx

emission. It is seen that the increase in NO emission is in general along
with the increase of the flame temperature.

Kim  et  al.  [96]  proposed  a  NOx  emission  prediction  model  for
H2/CO/CH4  gas  in  a  gas  turbine  model  burner  under  the  N2  dilution
condition.  Experimental  results  show  that  the  Zeldovich  mechanism
controls NOx production; flame temperature and residence time are two
critical factors affecting NOx production. The emission of NOx can be
predicted  from  the  fuel  composition,  diluent,  and  heat  input.  The
measured NOx emission is correlated to the predicted one according to
Eq. (9). Compared with experimental data, this model has a 95 % con-
fidence interval.

NOx = (cid:0) 0.11 × XH2

(cid:0) 8.11 × XCH4

(cid:0) 10.4 × XCO (cid:0) 13.3 × XN2

+ 15.8

× Pnorm [Measured NOx]
= 0.098 + 0.972 × [Predicted NOx]

(9)

Here,  Pnorm  represents  the  normalised  heat  input,  with  its  NOx
coefficient  being  the  largest,  indicating  the  maximum  influence  of
temperature/heat input on NOx emission. Xi  represents the mole frac-
tion of the i-th component of the H2/CO/CH4 fuel mixture. The negative
NOx coefficient of N2 suggests that under constant thermal power input,
N2 inhibits the formation of NOx due to its lower flame temperature, a
phenomenon explained by the effect of N2 dilution. The NOx coefficients
of fuel components are all negative, indicating that increasing the fuel
mole fraction may suppress the formation of NOx. However, the net NOx
formation results from the combustion of all fuel components. Since the

sum of Xi is 1, a decrease in the mole fraction of one species results in an
increase  in  the  mole  fractions  of  other  species.  Hydrogen  has  the
smallest negative coefficient. When the mole fraction of H2  increases,
the mole fractions of CH4 and/or CO decrease. Since XCH4 and XCO have
larger negative NOx coefficients, an increase of the mole fraction of H2
results in an increase in total NOx emissions. This result is consistent
with the results of Joo et al. [95].

If  only  the  influence  of  combustible  components  is  considered,
another prediction model of NOx emission, Eq. (10), has been proposed
by the same authors, which can more directly describe the impact of the
three combustible components on NOx emissions. According to Eq. (10),
the impact on NOx emissions can be ordered as XH2

> XCO.

> XCH4

NOx = 18.1 × XH2

+ 3.78 × XCH4

+ 2.72 × XCO

(10)

On this basis, Lee et al. [29] conducted further studies on the impact
of N2 on NOx and CO emissions under the same conditions. The results
showed that adding N2  can effectively reduce the combustion temper-
ature due to the decrease in the oxidation rate of the mixture and the
increase in the total heat capacity of the air-fuel mixture under constant
heat input. When N2 dilution reaches 60 %, NOx emissions for all power
and gas compositions can be below 10 ppm. However, increasing the
the
dilution  of  N2  will

shown  in  Fig.  21,  rapid  mixing  of  fuel,  air,  and  the  recirculated  hot
combustion  exhaust  gas  was  used  to  move  the  reaction  zone  down-
stream, forming a mode of “mixing first, then combustion.” The exhaust
gas  recirculation,  EGR,  on  the  one  hand,  gives  rise  to  dilution  to  the
fuel/air  mixture,  which  quenches  the  reactions  near  the  burner  and
thereby  enables  better  fuel/air/EGR  mixing  downstream,  and  on  the
other  hand,  increases  the  temperature  of  the  reactants  in  the  down-
stream region to sustain the chemical reactions.

In  a  different  approach,  flameless  combustion  was  realized  using
high-temperature air combustion (HiTAC) [100]. Under the condition of
flameless combustion, the reaction zone does not exhibit any prominent
flame  front,  and  the  temperature  field  is  uniform.  This  requires  a
high-speed jet flow of sufficient Reynolds number to form a significant
entrainment of exhaust gas. The thermal NO-formation is significantly
suppressed  by  exhaust  gas  dilution,  even  at  very  high  preheated  air
temperatures.

The second description of MILD combustion is “colorless distributed
combustion” (CDC) [37,47], as shown in Fig. 22. CDC relies on internal
recirculation  and  swirl  to  form  low  oxygen  concentration  and
high-temperature mixture before ignition. Unlike the previous method,
CDC  does  not  need  jets  with  large  Reynolds  numbers,  but achieves  a
uniform  distribution  of  the  reaction  zone  by  swirling  flow.  Such
distributed  and  low reaction  rate  region  is  achieved through  swirling
flows  and  fuel-side  dilution  or/and  air-side  dilution.  To  some  extent,
CDC combustion needs more dilution than flameless combustion.

The description of MILD combustion of Cavaliere and de Joannon in
2004  [33]  shares  the  same  features  of  combustion  as  flameless  com-
bustion  and  CDC:  uniformly  low-temperature  combustion,  flameless,
and
low  NOx  emissions.  However,  a  more  precise  condition,
ΔT < Tsi < Tin, is defined in MILD combustion. This condition can be
understood  using  a  well-stirred  reactor  (WSR)  model.  The  condition
Tsi < Tin  ensures that the mixture is ignited and combusted, whereas
the condition ΔT < Tsi  ensures that the combustion temperature will
not be too high. To ensure ΔT < Tsi  the oxygen mole fraction in the
mixture must be low, i.e., dilution to air or fuel is needed. The dilution
has chemical and physical effects. Chemical effects mainly refer to the
influence on the path and the rate of chemical reactions. Physical effects
include the impact of dilution on the heat capacity, the heat release per
unit  mass  of  the  mixture,  the  molecular  transport  properties  of  the
mixture, and the mixing rate and scalar dissipation rate. Both physical
and chemical effects affect the temperature field and pollutant emissions
[101–104]. This will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

WSR is an idealized model reactor. Although WSR will not be real-
ized in practical burners, conditions close to WSR can be approached.
For example, cyclone burner [105–108], high-speed jet [109,110], swirl
[111,112]  and  other  configurations  have  been  utilized  to  generate
WSR-like MILD combustion. MILD combustion can even be established
under laminar flow conditions [113,114], and low turbulence and low
Damk ̈ohler  number  (Da)  conditions  [115],  but  dilution  is  always
needed. In these practical applications, the local mixture has a certain
level  of  spatial  stratification in  composition  and  temperature.  A  local
point  where  the  temperature  of  the  mixture  is  higher  than  the
self-ignition  temperature  (Tin  > Tsi)  will  form  an  ignition  kernel  first

non-premixed flame. They found that with an increase in the H2 content,
thermal NOx, N2O-immediate NOx, and NNH NOx all increase. At the
peak level of NO emissions, the H2-rich flame has the highest NO level,
while the CO-rich flame has the lowest. In terms of the NO generation
rate, the integral of the NO generation rate increases with an increase in
the H2 level and decreases with an increase in the CO level. Moreover,
considering the dilution effect of N2, it was concluded that the increase
in the N2 dilution level leads to a significant decrease in the peak level of
NO emissions. H2-rich gas is the most sensitive one to the change of N2
dilution level, followed by CO- and CH4-rich gases. By doubling the level
of N2 dilution, the peak NO level in the H2-, CO-, and CH4-rich gases was
reduced by approximately 70 %, 50 %, and 30 %, respectively.

In non-premixed flames, it is worth noting that the emission of NOx
(EINOx) is affected by the strain rate because the strain rate is propor-
tional to the flame residence time in the reaction zone [98]. In diffusion
flames  of  syngas,  NOx  is  generated  at  the  outer  reaction  layer  of  the
flames because the highest flame temperature appears at the flame edge
near the stoichiometric condition. Since the thin reaction zone around
the stoichiometric mixture controls the flame length in a diffusion jet
flame,  NOx  emission  is  affected  by  the  flame  length  and  jet  velocity.
Additionally, due to the turbulence effect, the global strain rate affects
the NOx emission characteristics [95]. Park et al. [97] indicated that the
numerical simulations using the GRI 3.0 mechanism yield good overall
agreement with the measured peak level and the distribution of the NO
mole fraction over a relatively wide range of H2/CO compositions and
strain rates. Guo and Neill [99] numerically investigated the effect of
syngas  addition  on  NO  formation  in  strained  methane/air  diffusion
flames. They found that adding a small amount of syngas has a minor
impact on NO formation at low strain rates, but it can cause a significant
increase in NO formation at moderate or high strain rates.

3. LCVG MILD combustion burners

3.1. MILD combustion concept

High efficiency and low pollution emissions are perpetual goals of
combustion technology. However, achieving both goals simultaneously
can  be  challenging.  For  example,  high  combustion  efficiency  is  often
achieved at high flame temperatures, while low NOx emission prefers
low flame temperature. MILD combustion is one of the few concepts that
has  the  potential  to  achieve  both  high  efficiency  and  low  pollution
emissions. Historically, MILD combustion has been realized in various
ways and described differently.

The first description of MILD combustion is “flameless combustion”
by  Wünning  et  al.,  in  1997  [35].  In  their  pioneering  experiments,  as

Li  et  al.  [123],  Duwig  et  al.  [124],  and  Sepman  et  al.  [113],  among
others.  Sepman  et  al.  [113]  presented  a  laminar  JHC  burner  for
CH4/H2/N2  mixture,  as  shown  in  Fig.  24.  The  burner  was  operating
under laminar flow conditions, and the NO emission in the exhaust gas is
less than 13 ppm, which indicates a low combustion temperature MILD
combustion. In the burner, the hot gas coflow is the combustion product
of a lean methane/air premixed flame at an equivalence ratio of 0.8. The
coflow  gas temperature is  1530  K.  This  moderately high  temperature

[116]. In a stratified mixture, multiple ignition kernels grow and prop-
agate to the location where Tin  < Tsi. The phenomenon is not a flame
propagation process; it is controlled mainly by self-ignition [117,118].
This scenario is similar to that in HCCI engines. The ignition delay time
is  less  than  the  time  scale  of  flame  propagation  (τign < τchem),  where
τchem is the time that a flame propagates a distance of flame thickness. In
conventional flame propagation, the ignition delay time is longer than
the time scale of the chemical reactions in the flame (τign > τchem). In
practical MILD combustion, auto-ignition and flame propagation may
occur simultaneously at different spatial locations, for example, when
the ignition delay time is close to the time scale of the chemical reaction
(τign ≈ τchem). Equation (8) in Section 2.5 shows that the ignition delay
time  decreases  exponentially  with  the  increase  of  inlet  temperature.
Therefore,  τign < τchem  may  be  achieved  by  air  preheating  [43],  EGR
[44], or jet in hot coflow (JHC) [45].

Although decreasing the  oxygen concentration in  the mixture  will
slightly increase the ignition delay time, it will significantly reduce the
temperature rise and suppress NO formation. The ultra-low NOx emis-
sion  of  MILD  combustion  is  primarily  due  to  three  mechanisms:  (1)
Under the dilution and intense turbulence conditions, the reaction zone
is homogenised, and there is no local high-temperature zone [119]; (2)
NOx generation rate decreases under dilution conditions [120]; (3) The
formation  routes  of  NOx  change  under  MILD  combustion  conditions
[121].

For  LCVG,  a  large  amount  of  dilution  gas  will  increase  the  self-
ignition  temperature  and  ignition  delay  time  of  the  mixture.  There-
fore,  the  preheating  of  reactants  is  very  important.  The  definition  of
“MILD” is probably the most suitable for LCVG due to the dilution gas in
LCVG and the low LHV of LCVG. In the following, different burners for
MILD combustion of LCVG are discussed.

3.2. Combustor design and establishment of LCVG MILD combustion

3.2.1. Preheated premixed burner

Derudi et al. [46] used a premixed combustion burner with a single
nozzle to realize MILD combustion of CH4/H2, as shown in Fig. 23. To
generate the condition of MILD combustion, i.e., Tin > Tsi, a ‘preheating
furnace’ is used to increase the temperature of the primary air/inert gas
and the secondary air up to 1573 K. The primary air is diluted with inert
gas,  and  the  oxygen  concentration  in  the  mixture  is  reduced  to  3  %
before mixing with the fuel. The highly diluted primary air/inert gas is
aimed to ensure the second condition of MILD combustion ΔT < Tsi. The
single-nozzle  premixed  combustion  burner  represents  the  most  chal-
lenging case for establishing MILD combustion because the combustion
may  start before the  reactants are entirely diluted  when  using highly
reactive fuels such as H2 mixtures. Therefore, it has been concluded that
it is easier to achieve stable MILD combustion of CH4/H2  for partially
premixed  mixtures.  Non-premixed  MILD  combustion  can  be  achieved
through high-speed injection of fuel and air.

3.2.2. Jet in hot co-flow (JHC) burner

The  JHC  burner  has  been  used  to  generate  MILD  combustion,  for
example, in studies conducted by Dally et al. [122], Medwell et al. [45],

Fig. 24. Schematic of the laminar jet in hot coflow (JHC) burner proposed by
Sepman et al. Reprinted from Ref. [113] with permission from Elsevier.

S. Zhou et al.

provides  the  condition  of  Tin > Tsi  for  MILD  combustion.  The  oxygen
concentration  is  3.6  %  in  the  coflow  gas,  which  is  higher  than  that
required for the second condition of MILD combustion, ΔT < Tsi. Due to
the lean flammability limit, it is no longer feasible to reduce the oxygen
concentration in the coflow flame; thus, the fuel is diluted with nitrogen,
and the oxidant is also diluted to ensure ΔT < Tsi. Huang et al. [125]
proposed  a  turbulent  MILD  burner  with  a  similar  structure.  It  can  be
observed from Table 8 that the fuel injection speed reaches 93–168 m/s,
which helps to entrain high-temperature coflow gas. With increased fuel
injection  speed,  NOx  emission  decreases,  and  CO  emission  increases
marginally. It can be shown that τign ≈ τchem  in both the laminar [113]
and  turbulent  [125]  combustion  cases,  and  the  condition  for  MILD
combustion is met.

3.2.3. Jet in preheated air coflow (JPA) burner

Hosseini  et  al.  [119]  designed  a  MILD  combustor  for  biogas.  As
shown  in  Fig.  25,  an  exhaust  gas  heat  exchanger  and  an  electric  air
heater were used to preheat the air to achieve Tin > Tsi. The fuel was
injected  into  combustor  through  the  central  fuel  jet  at  a  Reynolds
number  of  20,500,  and  the  preheated  air  was  injected  through  the
annular jets at a speed of 85 m/s. A uniform temperature distribution in
the combustor was achieved due to turbulence mixing and the presence
of CO2 in the biogas, which enhances the rate of radiation and leads the
system  to better distribute the heat throughout  the furnace. Using an
exhaust gas heat exchanger can aid air preheating and, at the same time,
recover  waste  heat  of  high-temperature  flue  gas,  improving  energy

3.2.4. Parallel jet forward-flow (PJFF) burner

Huang  et  al.  [11,127,128]  developed  a  parallel  jet  forward-flow
(PJFF) MILD combustor for syngas. As shown in Fig. 26, four different
air and fuel supply systems could be used, ABFB, ABFT, ATFT, and ATFB,
to achieve a stronger internal EGR and more delayed air/fuel mixing.
The oxygen concentration in a forward-flow configuration is lower than
in a reverse-flow configuration. Under the experimental conditions, the
parallel  flow-forward  burner  (ABFB)  is  the  optimal  one,  which  can
achieve  the  optimal  conditions  of  MILD  combustion.  In  this  burner,

when global equivalence ratio is 0.5, NOx emission is 4 ppm, and CO
emission is 39 ppm.

Fig. 27 shows an optimal version of the PJFF MILD combustor, based
on the ABFB burner configuration [11,128]. The PJFF burner [11,128]
does not use air preheating or hot coflow but only uses a high-speed jet
and internal EGR to heat fresh reactants to achieve Tin > Tsi. This sim-
plifies the operation of the combustor. In a similar burner, Mi et al. [129]
also showed that air preheating is not necessary; instead, a high-speed
jet is required to achieve MILD combustion for CH4. There is a critical
momentum  rate  of  the  inlet  fuel-air  mixture  below  which  the  MILD
combustion  cannot  occur.  High-speed  jet  has  two  effects.  First,  high
speed jet can entrain the flue gas upstream to preheat the fresh reactants.
Second,  the  entrainment  of  exhaust  gas  can  also  reduce  the  oxygen
concentration  in  the  reaction  zone,  which  reduces  the  reaction  rate,
increases the residence time of reactants, and reduces the temperature
increase.

The  PJFF  burner  has  the  potential  to  achieve  MILD  combustion.
However, the configuration and operating conditions of the burner must
be optimised to attain the lowest pollutant emissions for different fuels.
As shown in Fig. 27, the burner of Huang et al. [11,128] has four con-
figurations:  A7F10,  A6F3.6,  A6F2.5,  and  A7F1.8  (where  the  numbers
after A and F indicate the diameters of the air jet and fuel jet in milli-
metres, respectively). It was demonstrated that the ‘A7F1.8’ configura-
tion exhibited significant advantages in establishing MILD combustion.
Furthermore, it displayed ultra-low pollutant emissions: 5 ppm of NOx
and 3 ppm of CO at φ = 0.6. However, it should be noted that under the
configuration of A7F1.8, the equivalence ratio should also be controlled
to achieve near-zero NOx and CO emissions.

3.2.5. Swirl burner

Khalil et al. [47] presented a non-premixed swirl burner to establish
the CDC for CH4 and CH4/H2 combustion in preheated and diluted air.
As  shown  in  Fig.  28,  a  conventional  diffusion  flame  can  be  observed
when the air is undiluted. However, when the air is diluted, the original
diffusion flame becomes CDC. It should be noted that although CDC is
considered to be similar to MILD combustion, it can be observed that the
two  have  specific  differences.  In  terms  of  Tin > Tsi,  CDC  may  omit

oxidant preheating; the combustion of fresh reactants depends primarily
on  the  flame  propagation.  MILD  combustion  depends  mainly  on
self-ignition  by  air  preheating  or  EGR.  Therefore,  CDC  emphasises
forming a distributed reaction zone structure by diluting reactants and
swirling flow. Furthermore, Karyeyen et al. [126] also diluted the fuel to
simulate the composition of COG. The simultaneous dilution of fuel and
oxidant can further promote the establishment of CDC.

is  enhanced  by  reducing  the  diameter  of  the  jet  (which  results  in  an
increase in the velocity) or density (which requires an increase in the
temperature). Therefore, high injection speed and preheating are used in
the system. Preheating also improves the stability limit of the system.
The residence time in this system is also longer because of the reversal of
the flow.

3.2.6. Cyclonic flow burner

Sabia et al. [106] adopted the strategy of creating a stable distributed
combustion  zone  in  a  cyclone  flow  field,  as  shown  in  Fig.  29.  The
establishment of the cyclone flow field in the combustion chamber can
ensure that the fresh reactants are diluted, and temperature of the re-
actants  is  increased  to  reach  Tsi.  The  combination  of  the  diluted  re-
actants  and  preheating  can  significantly  improve  the  system’s  energy
efficiency, reducing the generation of pollutants and establishing MILD
combustion. The demonstrated suitable fuels for this device include CH4
and biogas.

3.2.7. Reverse-flow burner

Pramanik and Ravikrishna [48] proposed a reverse-flow burner to
establish  MILD  combustion  for  syngas,  as  shown  in  Fig.  30.  The
reverse-flow structure is a type of flow that can achieve high-intensity
internal  EGR.  The  reverse-flow  configuration  uses  a  front  stagnation

Inverse diffusion flame (IDF) burner

Verissimo  et  al.  [130–133]  developed  an  inverse  diffusion  flame
(IDF) burner to establish MILD combustion. Fig. 31 illustrates the burner
configuration  and  OH*  chemiluminescence  imaging  of  the  reaction
zones. The fuel is injected into the combustor through annular jets, while
the air is injected through the central jet. This configuration differs from
that of a reverse-flow burner or JPA burner, where the fuel is injected
into  the  combustor  through  the  central  jet.  Consequently,  the  flame
structure is different and referred to as IDF. The fuel flow velocity is low,
for  example,  6.2  m/s,  while  the  air  flow  is  preheated  to  400
C  and
injected into the combustor at high speed, ranging from 96 to 185 m/s
[130]. It was found that at a sufficiently high air jet velocity, approxi-
mately  100  m/s,  MILD  combustion  could  be  established.  However,  a
further increase in air flow velocity, leading to a higher overall excess air
coefficient  λ  (the  ratio  between  the  actual  air-fuel  ratio  and  the  stoi-
chiometric  air-fuel  ratio),  would  cause  the  transition  from  MILD

combustion to conventional IDF. This is because at high excess air levels,
hot recirculated gases with relatively high oxygen concentrations mix
with the fuel jets, creating conditions conducive to the establishment of
conventional combustion.

3.2.9. Multi-inlet cross jets (MICJ) burner

Kwiatkowski and Mastorakos [50] proposed a multi-inlet cross jets
(MICJ) burner for MILD combustion of BGG. Three burner configura-
tions are proposed: (a) coflow with additional air inlets, (b) cross jets,
and (c) cyclic cross jets, as shown in Fig. 32. The unique feature of the
burner is that the fuel is preheated to 1000 K, and the air is at atmo-
spheric temperature. This is because the air-fuel ratio of BGG is signif-
icantly low. For ultra-low calorific value BGG, the air-fuel ratio is even
lower than 1; therefore, preheating the BGG will be more helpful. It was
also shown that for BGG1, which is a mixture of CO/H2/CH4/CO2/N2
with the mole ratio of 27/8/2/8/55, it is challenging to establish MILD
combustion  in  these  burners.  The MILD  regime  can  be  achieved only
when  the  EGR  rate  reaches  70  %.  However,  for  BGG7  produced  by
feather gasification, which is a mixture of CO/H2/CH4/CO2/N2 with the

burners under both conventional combustion (CC) and MILD combus-
tion at the same thermal input, the pollutant emissions reported in the
aforementioned studies were standardized to a reference condition of
15 % O2 concentration. The results of this standardization are presented
in Fig. 35. Most studies focused on the thermal input of 0–25 kW, with a
small  portion  reaching  100–250  kW  in  micro  gas  turbines.  For  NOx
emissions, there is a clear difference between MILD combustion and CC,
with the NOx emission from CC increasing with the thermal input at a
rate higher than 1 ppm@15%O2/kW. NOx emissions from MILD com-
bustion are nearly independent of the thermal input. For CO emissions,
mixed results are reported in the literature. High CO emissions can be
found in both CC and MILD combustion.

4. Experiments on LCVG MILD combustion

4.1. Impact of H2/CH4  ratio on MILD combustion of coke oven gas
(COG)

◦
C–1000

Coke-oven  gas  (COG)  is  produced  during  the  manufacture  of
metallurgical  coke  by  heating  bituminous  coal  to  temperatures  of
◦
900
C. Its main constituents, by volume, are approximately 50
% hydrogen, 30 % methane and 3 % higher hydrocarbons, 7 % carbon
monoxide, 3 % carbon dioxide, and 7 % nitrogen. The gas has a heating
value of about 20 MJ/m3. The CH4/H2 ratio in COG has a great impact
on the combustion of COG. Derudi et al. [46] investigated the feasibility
of MILD combustion of COG with CH4/H2  molar ratio of 40/60 as the
primary  components  in  a  laboratory  scale  premixed  burner  (Fig.  23).
The  control  parameters  in  this  burner  include  the  jet  velocity  of  the
premixed fuel/air/diluent mixture, the dilution level in the mixture, and
the temperature of the surrounding preheated air (which can be heated
up  to  1300
C).  The  reactant  jet  velocity  impacts  the  mixing  of  the
reactant  with  the  hot  air  surrounding  the  jet.  A  dilution  ratio,  KV,
defined as the ratio between the recycled exhaust and the incoming air
and  fuel  flow  rates,  was  found  to  be  critical  for  establishing  MILD
combustion.

◦

As shown in Fig. 36, the emissions of NOx in the exhaust gas vary for
different dilution ratios under different preheating temperatures. Under
◦
a  preheating  temperature  of  1100
C,  Fig.  36  (a),  it  is  observed  that
without  hydrogen  in  the  fuel,  there  is  a  sudden  transition  from  con-
ventional flame (NOx emission >150 ppm) to MILD combustion (indi-
cated by NOx emission <30 ppm) when KV is increased above 4.5. The
corresponding reactant jet velocity is about 50 m/s. For COG combus-
tion, the transition is less clear at this preheating temperature. The NOx
emission gradually decreases as the dilution ratio increases (reactant jet

mole ratio of 3/7/4/27/59, the LHV of the fuel is ultra-low, and it can
achieve the MILD regime relatively easily. The coflow requires only a 20
% EGR rate. Cross jets and cyclic cross jets can achieve a MILD com-
bustion regime even without EGR.

3.2.10. Micro-gas turbine (MGT) burner

Cameretti  et  al.  [49]  used  a  heat  exchanger  in  a  lean  premixed
micro-gas turbine (MGT) burner to achieve external EGR, thus achieving
clean MILD combustion for biogas. The plant layout of the recuperated
MGT with the exhaust recirculation is shown in Fig. 33. In a gas turbine,
the compressor and external EGR can preheat the reactants, while the
external EGR can dilute the reactants.

Zornek et al. [43] implemented a MILD combustor in MGT, as shown
in Fig. 34. The combustor consists of pilot and main stages. A swirl flame
is established in the pilot stage, and a jet flame is employed in the main
stage.  This  configuration  generates  strong  EGR,  which  helps  achieve
MILD combustion. Air is drawn from the regenerator and divided into
combustion and dilution air. The dilution air constitutes approximately
two-thirds of the air, entering the combustion chamber downstream of
the combustion zone. This dilution restricts the turbine inlet tempera-
◦
ture to a maximum of 950
C, the maximum allowable inlet temperature
for the turbine, ensuring the condition ΔT < Tsi  for MILD combustion is
satisfied.

To enable a direct comparison of NOx and CO emissions from various

of COG was low (3 %); therefore, clean MILD combustion can also be
achieved in highly diluted environments. This characteristic shows that
H2 can be used as an additive for MILD combustion of LCVG due to the
lower  required  oxygen  concentration  in  the  oxidant.  H2  can  also
enhance hydrocarbon oxidization due to its high reactivity, as discussed
in Section 2. The increase in the preheating temperature will increase
NOx emission due to the rise in the combustion temperature (as sum-
marised in Section 2.5). However, the overall NOx and CO emissions are
still lower than 30 ppm, which is the advantage of MILD combustion.

In  MILD  combustion  of  COG,  the  influence  of  H2  on  the  flame
structure is substantial. In a study of COG MILD combustion in the LJHC
burner (Fig. 24). Sepman et al. [113] showed that an increase of H2 in
the fuel mixture led to a significant decrease of the flame height (~25 %)
and a promoted ignition; however, it had a minor effect on the maximum
combustion temperature and the thickness of combustion zone. Mardani
and Mahalegi [134] compared the impact of H2  in the fuel mixture on
the MILD combustion of COG (H2/CH4) and syngas (H2/CO) mixtures.
The  results  showed  that  the  combustion  region  increased  and  moved
upstream with increased H2 content in the COG mixture. A decrease in
oxygen  concentration  in  the  oxidant  flow  reduced  the  volume  of  the
combustion  region  of  COG,  and  the  temperature  gradient  was  more
uniform and closer to the MILD condition. In the case of syngas, these
effects  were  even  more  substantial,  and  the  syngas  could  burn  in  a
broader range of oxygen dilution. The syngas case is more sensitive to
hydrogen addition than COG, making it easier for H2  as an additive to
achieve MILD conditions for the syngas case.

4.2. Impact of non-combustion diluents on MILD combustion of biogas

In the realm of available LCVGs, biogas MILD combustion has been a
subject of extensive research. In the following discussion, we explore the
conditions necessary for establishing MILD combustion, the impacts of

velocity increases). In COG, the high amount of hydrogen, which has
high reactivity and diffusivity, tends to burn locally, requiring a higher
dilution ratio and mixing rate to generate homogeneously low temper-
ature and, consequently, low NOx emission. To achieve NOx emission
levels  less  than  30  ppm  (an  indication  of  the  establishment  of  MILD
combustion), COG required a jet velocity >75 m/s (Kv > 10). The pre-
heating temperature has a significant impact on NOx emissions due to
the thermal-NO mechanism. As shown in Fig. 36 (b), a lower preheating
temperature requires a lower dilution ratio to achieve a threshold NOx
emission of 30 ppm. When the preheating temperature was 650, 1000,
and  1200
C,  COG  MILD  combustion  required  a  dilution  ratio  KV  of
about 5, 10, and 17, respectively.

various  parameters,  the  combustion  characteristics,  and  the  pollutant
emissions associated with biogas MILD combustion.

Hosseini  et  al.  [119]  studied  MILD  combustion  of  biogas  using  a
laboratory-scale jet in preheated air coflow (JPA) burner (Fig. 25). They
showed that MILD combustion could be easily established for biogas due
to  existence  of  non-combustible  species  CO2.  Under  the  condition  of
MILD  combustion  of  biogas,  the  emissions  of  CO  and  NOx  were  low.
Using the heat exchanger to preheat the coflow air increased the effi-
ciency of MILD combustion of biogas and reduced the heat loss. Further,
the high concentration of CO2  in biogas increases the heat capacity of
products,  enhanced  radiation  heat  transfer,  and  increased  absorption

capacity, thus improving the system’s performance (low NO emission
and  better  durability).  The  CO  formation  in  the  combustion  chamber
showed  that  the  reaction  zone  was  distributed  in  the  furnace.  The
temperature  in  the  furnace  was  uniform,  without  a  hot  spot,  and  the
thermal  NO  was  suppressed.  The  experimental  results  also  confirmed
that increasing the temperature of preheating air could increase the NOx
generation  rate. The temperature uniformity in  the furnace  improved
the  durability  of  equipment,  especially  burners,  and  refractories.
Reducing fuel consumption and pollutant formation is another advan-
tage of biogas MILD combustion.

Sabia  et  al.  [106]  compared  the  characteristics  of  CH4/air  and

biogas/air MILD combustion in a cyclone combustor (Fig. 29). To ach-
ieve optimal operation conditions, the system had to operate under the
condition  of  an  equivalence  ratio  marginally  lower  than  one.  For
CH4/air mixtures, the system showed less than 100 ppm emission of CO.
When the temperature was lower than 1400 K, the NOx emission could
be reduced to less than 10 ppm. Further, owing to the increase in CO
emission,  extinction  could  occur;  therefore,  the  working  temperature
should  be  sufficiently  high,  e.g.,  higher  than  1100  K.  In  the  case  of
biogas, the best  equivalence ratio for reducing emissions  was slightly
lower than that for the CH4 mixture. In the biogas gas, it was convenient
to optimise the system with a higher nominal thermal power owing to
the cooling effect caused by the effects of the CO2  heat sink. The pres-
ence of CO2 is conducive to the reduction of NOx emissions. On the other
hand,  it  was  suggested  that  the  working  temperature  should  not  be
higher than 1400 K to avoid the decomposition of CO2 to CO and higher
thermal NO emission.

Cameretti et al. [49] studied the MILD combustion of biogas in an
MGT system (Fig. 33). The concepts of external and internal EGRs were
proposed to reduce NOx in MGT. Both the internal and external EGR
aimed  to  reduce  the  thermal  NO  and  prompt  NO  formation  by
approaching  the  MILD  combustion.  External  EGR  could  reduce  NO
emissions  without affecting combustion efficiency. It should be noted
that when supplying biogas to MGT, the EGR ratio must be reduced to
maintain an acceptable thermal power level.

The dilution effects of the non-combustible components of biogas on
MILD combustion, a mixture of CO2, N2, H2O and CH4 have been stud-
ied. Tu et al. [101–103] identified the thermal and chemical effects of
diluent on MILD combustion of biogas in a JHC burner. These effects are
summarised  as  shown  in  Fig.  37.  For  CO2,  the  chemical  effect  is  the
primary one, i.e., by reducing OH generation in the MILD combustion
zone.  In  contrast,  the  physical  effect  is  dominant  in  a  conventional
combustion zone. The physical effect is the primary for H2O irrespective
of the MILD or conventional combustion zone. The chemical effect of
CO2  and  H2O  results  in  a  delayed  ignition  for  the  JHC  flame.  The
Damk ̈ohler number distribution showed that the MILD combustion up-
stream of the JHC burner was predominantly controlled by the chemical
reaction.  In  contrast,  the  conventional  combustion  downstream  was
controlled by mixing. The dilution of CO2  enlarged the MILD combus-
tion reaction zone, and H2O weakened this zone. This suggests that H2O
is less conducive to MILD combustion than CO2.

Khalil et al. [47] studied the MILD combustion of CH4 and CH4/H2
mixtures in preheated and diluted air in a swirl burner, Fig. 28. The final
oxygen  concentration  reflected  the  dilution  effect  of  N2  and  CO2.
Figs. 38 and 39 show the OH distribution of the two fuels at different
oxygen concentrations. During the transition to MILD combustion, NO
emission is reduced by more than 80 % to less than 2 ppm; e.g., the NOx
emission of CH4/H2  is reduced by 92 % to 1.9 ppm. When the equiva-
lence ratio is lower than 0.7, the emissions of different fuels are as low as
1 ppm of NO and 3 ppm of CO. The oxygen concentration of each fuel for

establishing MILD combustion is marginally different when the diluent
temperature is 300 K (for CH4  and CH4/H2, it is 13.8 % and 12.2 %,
respectively). The difference decreases with the increase in the diluent
temperature. At 750 K, the oxygen concentrations is respectively 11.23
% and 10.5 % for CH4  and CH4/H2. The oxygen concentration in the
transition  from  conventional  combustion  to  MILD  combustion  can  be
extrapolated to predict the required oxygen concentration and recycle
ratio under actual combustor conditions. For example, at the dilution
gas temperature of 1800 K, the oxygen concentration required for MILD
combustion  is  approximately  9.5  %.  Thus,  with  the  increase  in  the
preheating  temperature,  the  oxygen  concentration  required  for  MILD
combustion could be lower.

Sepman et al. [135] studied the NO emission of MILD combustion of
CH4 diluted by N2 (20/80 vol %) in an LJHC burner (Fig. 24). When the
diluted oxidant and diluted fuel were preheated to more than 1000 K,
the  temperature  increase  in  the  reaction  zone  was  less  than  300  K.
Therefore,  it  was  considered  that  MILD  combustion  occurred  in  the
system.  The  measurement  of  the  NO  mole  fraction  profile  using
laser-induced  fluorescence  imaging  showed  that  the  contribution  of
MILD combustion to NO mole fraction was less than 2 ppm. NO emission
was analysed as a function of mixture components. The results showed
that NO was primarily composed of the NO formed in coflow and re-
action products of the diluted mixture; however, the NO generated from
the fuel could be ignored.

The dilution effects of N2  and CO2  are different. Zhang et al. [136]
studied the characteristic difference of MILD combustion of CH4 diluted
with N2 and CO2. The results showed that it was easier to establish MILD
combustion when CO2  was the diluent in replacement of N2. The key
reason  is  that  CO2  reduces  the  temperature  increase  and  the  overall
reaction rate and increases the ignition delay time, thus promoting the
onset of MILD combustion. As Tu et al. [101–103] indicated, the tem-
perature decrease is primarily due to the physical effect of CO2 dilution
(higher  heat  capacity).  The  delayed  ignition  is  mainly  due  to  the
chemical effects. In addition, the study of reaction routes showed that
CO2 dilution increased the local CO generation through H + CO2 → OH
+ CO and CO2 + CH2 (s) → CO + H2O.

To compare the dilution effect of N2 and CO2 with other parameters,
Mehregan et al. [120] used the Taguchi approach. They compared the
influences of N2 and CO2 dilution, preheating temperature, and oxygen
concentration  on  the  NOx  emission  in  MILD  combustion.  The  results
showed that the most critical factors affecting NOx emission were oxy-
gen concentration and air preheating temperature, which accounted for
57 % and 32 %, respectively. The N2 and CO2 dilution accounted only for
11  %.  Liu  et  al.  [137]  compared  the  MILD  combustion  of  biogas  in
oxygen/CO2  and oxygen/H2O under different preheating temperatures
of the oxidiser and oxygen concentration in the oxidiser mixture. They
found that although MILD combustion of biogas was easier to establish
with  H2O  dilution,  entropy  generation  analysis  showed  that  it  was
highly sensitive to oxygen concentration and had significant tempera-
ture  fluctuation. Therefore,  CO2  dilution was  easier to generate  more
stable MILD combustion. Amar et al. [138] revealed that the concen-
tration of OH radicals increased through H2  enrichment and H2O dilu-
tion, while the CO concentration decreased by adding H2O. Adding H2 to
the fuel increases the intermediate component C2H2, which is weakened
by the thermal effect of H2O dilution, as shown in Fig. 40. The addition
of H2 and the thermal effect of H2O dilution can reduce the concentra-
tion of CH2O. Adding H2 to the fuel increases NO generation, which can
be reduced by the physical and chemical effects of H2O dilution.

Dai et al. [139] studied the influence of N2 and H2O dilution on CH4
MILD combustion in a JHC burner. When the diluent was changed from
N2  to H2O, the flame temperature and flame length decreased signifi-
cantly, primarily owing to the different physical properties of N2  and
H2O (H2O has lower density and higher heat capacity). The change from
N2 to H2O had a more significant chemical effect on forming radicals (e.
g., H, O, CO, OH), resulting in longer ignition delay and increased flame
lift-off distance. Therefore, the JHC flame diluted by H2O could establish

MILD combustion more easily than by N2. However, the difference in the
impact of the two diluents decreased with the increase in oxygen con-
centration of the coflow.

4.3. Impact of composition and operating condition on syngas MILD
combustion

The  composition  of  syngas  may  include  H2,  CO,  CO2,  and  other
components. It is therefore important to understand the impact of these
components on MILD combustion process of syngas. Furthermore, the
preheating air temperature, burner configuration, and injection velocity
can  affect  the  establishment  of  MILD  combustion.  Huang  et  al.  [11]
studied the effect of air/fuel momentum ratio (Maf) on MILD combustion
of syngas derived from coal in a PJFF combustor (Fig. 27). The syngas
consists of H2, CO, and N2 with mole fractions of 0.38, 0.48, and 0.14,
respectively. ratio. The temperatures for both air and fuel jets were 293
K and the operating pressure was 1 atm. The isothermal flow was studied
using numerical simulations. The distribution of OH* and the emission
of pollutants in the exhaust gas were studied in the experiments. The
experiments were conducted at a heat load of 12.2–36.7 kW and global

equivalence ratios of 0.2–0.6. As shown in Fig. 41, the isothermal flow
simulation showed that Maf  significantly impacted the velocity field. A
strong reverse flow and recirculation flow motion was induced, mainly
by the airflow, since the airflow momentum was more significant than
the fuel flow momentum. As Maf decreased (with decreasing fuel nozzle
diameter),  the fuel flow could also enhance swirling  motion (i.e., the
case ‘A7F1.8’ with an air jet diameter of 7 mm and a fuel jet diameter of
1.8 mm, and Maf = 2.2), due to the stronger fuel flow.

It can be observed from the OH* distribution shown in Fig. 42 that
the A7F10 cases (with an air jet diameter of 7 mm and a fuel jet diameter
of 10 mm) were in the conventional diffusion combustion mode. For the
other three configurations, the distribution of OH* was more uniform,
especially at higher equivalence ratios, indicating the combustion pro-
cess in the MILD combustion regime. The pollutant emissions shown in
Fig. 43 indicated that the NOx emission in the A7F10 case is greater than
7 ppm, and the CO emission can even reach 900 ppm. For the A7F1.8
configuration, the NOx emission is 5 ppm, and CO emission is 3 ppm
under an equivalent ratio of 0.6. The other two configurations have the
potential for MILD combustion, but the CO emission is higher. As shown
earlier in the flow field comparison in Fig. 41, the case ‘A7F1.8’ had a

temperature and  more complete combustion at  the higher  preheating
temperatures.  At  the  air  preheating  temperature  of  573  K,  when  the
equivalence ratio exceeded the critical value of 0.39, low NOx and CO
emissions  could  be  achieved  simultaneously.  T  When  the  equivalent
ratio was 0.49, NOx emissions increased from 5 ppm to 7 ppm, and CO
emissions  decreased  from  38  ppm  to  28  ppm  as  the  air  temperature
increased from 293 K to 573K.

The effects of H2 addition could be understood by comparing results
in  Figs.  44  and  43.  The  high  H2  syngas  case  (Fig.  43,  A7F1.8  burner
results) shows NOx emissions of 3–5 ppm, slightly lower than the 5–8
ppm NOx emissions in the low H2 syngas case (Fig. 44, air temperature
293  K).  However,  the  CO  emissions  are  quite  different.  The  high  H2
syngas case has CO emissions less than 75 ppm for all equivalence ratios,
while the low H2 syngas case has CO emissions close to 90 ppm under the
low equivalence ratio condition. Thus, the NOx emission were margin-
ally increased by adding H2. However, H2 can promote the oxidation of
CO and improve combustion efficiency. It is beneficial to use H2 addition
to  achieve  low  NOx  and  CO  emissions  under  the  MILD  combustion
conditions.

The same conclusion was obtained in a study of syngas MILD com-
bustion in a JHC burner [125], as shown in Fig. 45. The hot coflow of the
JHC burner increased the preheating temperature to 841 K. Increasing
the fuel injection speed is conducive to having rapid mixing of fuel and
oxidant and the establishment of a higher lift-off distance, lower flame
temperature, more uniform temperature field, and lower NOx emission
[125]. However, it also leads to higher pressure loss and CO emissions.
For the syngas MILD combustion, it is necessary to control the operating
parameters to achieve ultra-low NOx and CO emissions simultaneously.
Pramanik  and  Ravikrishn  [48]  studied  the  MILD  combustion  of
syngas (CO/H2/N2 with 20/20/60 vol ratio) in a reverse-flow combustor
(Fig.  30).  The  primary  parameters  are  the  global  equivalent  ratio

stronger recirculation flow motion, thus, a better mixing rate of hot gas,
resulting in a longer residence time, and a lower CO emission.

For the optimal configuration of A7F1.8, Huang et al. [128] inves-
tigated  the  impact  of  preheating  air  temperature  on  the  combustion
process. They preheated the air from 293 K to 573 K. The syngas con-
tains a rather low concentration of H2 (4.2 vol%), but rather high con-
centration of CO (74.2 vol%) and N2  (21.6 vol%). The results showed
that  a higher  air preheating  temperature increased  NOx emission  but
decreased  CO emission, as  shown in Fig. 44,  due to  the higher  flame

(0.32–0.89), the volume percentage of oxygen in coflow (7.6–21 %), and
preheating temperature of the oxidant (400–800 K). In all cases, auto-
ignition kernels were observed near the inlet, which might be a possible
means of flame stabilisation, thus highlighting the role of H2 in reducing
the ignition delay. The combustion process was stable within all ranges
of equivalent ratio and oxygen percentage, and the conventional com-
bustion process showed fluctuations in the reaction region (OH). Com-
bustion  became  unstable  when  the  oxidant  preheating  temperature

decreased  from  603  K  to  547  K.  This  shows  the  importance  of  high
preheating temperature for combustion stability in the MILD regime of
high-speed reverse flow.

4.4. MILD combustion of LCVG with multi-components

The  MILD  combustion  characteristics  of  LCVG  with  more  compo-
nents  are  discussed  here.  Examples  of  such  fuels  include  CGG,  BGG,

COG, and producer gas, all of which contain four or more components.
Chanphavong and Zainal [140] discussed the characterization and
challenge  of  development  of  producer  gas  fuel  combustor.  Producer
gases can achieve combustion stability through various flame stabilisa-
tion technologies such as bluff-body, swirl blade, swirl combustor, and
staged  combustion  chamber.  Under  conventional  combustion  condi-
tions,  NOx  and  CO  emissions  were  approximately  100–700  ppm.  By
using  MILD  combustion  technology,  one  can  reduce  NOx  and  CO
emissions to lower than 100 ppm. Numerous studies have shown that
combining renewable gas and MILD combustion will lead to ultra-low
pollution emissions. The uniform temperature field and high inlet tem-
perature of MILD combustion will help to burn residual fuel and other
pollutants and overcome the low heating density of producer gas. Thus,
using  producer  gas  and  MILD  combustion  is  beneficial  from  the  eco-
nomic and environmental perspective.

The  dilution  of  oxidizer  (i.e.,  the  oxygen  concentration  in  the
oxidizer) helps achieve MILD combustion of LCVG. Karyeyen and Ilbas
[141]  compared  the  difference  between  conventional  diffusion  com-
bustion and MILD combustion of COG. The results show that the thermal
uniformity  of  COG  is  moderate  to  poor  under  the  condition  of  21  %
oxygen  (indicating conventional  diffusion combustion).  When N2  and
CO2  are used as the diluents, the combustion showed distributed char-
acteristics of MILD combustion. The difference between the maximum
temperature and the outlet temperature was only 100 K.

Under  the  condition  of  MILD  combustion,  adding  the  hot  gas
contributed  to  thermal  uniformity.  MILD  combustion  also  helps  to
reduce  NOx  emission  to  near-zero  emission.  Fortunato  et  al.  [142]

studied the MILD combustion of H2-rich LCVG in a MILD combustor. As
listed in Table 9, two types of LCVG, i.e., COG and B50, were studied.
When  the  air  was  preheated  to  670  K,  870  K,  and  1070  K,  the  CO
emissions  of  MILD  combustion  were  less  than  100  ppm.  The  NOx
emissions  were  low,  about  10  ppm,  12  ppm,  and  14  ppm  for  COG,
respectively,  and  4  ppm,  5  ppm,  and  6  ppm  for  B50,  respectively.
Although the complex composition of multiple component fuels makes it
difficult to compare the effects of a single component, it is nevertheless
possible to observe that B50, which has more diluted components and a
lower LHV, exhibits better ultra-low emission characteristics.

Karyeyen et al. studied swirl-stabilised MILD combustion [143]. The
fuel composition was H2 (40–60 %), CH4 (20–40 %), N2 (10 %), and CO2
(10 %). Under the condition of Φ = 0.9, gaseous fuel 1 (50 % H2), fuel 2
(60 % H2), and fuel 3 (40 % H2) began to transition to MILD combustion
at 19 %, 17 %, and 21 % of oxygen concentrations, respectively. The
presence of H2  in the fuel significantly affected the transition to MILD
combustion. For fuel 1, at φ = 0.7–0.8, the CO emission level remained
about 10 ppm. At high equivalence ratio, the CO emission of fuel 2 was
about  20  ppm.  For  fuel  3,  the  CO  emission  was  50  ppm  at  φ  = 0.9;

however, a reduction of equivalence ratio led the CO emission to reduce
to  less  than  20  ppm.  Furthermore,  Karyeyen  et  al.  [143]  studied  the
MILD  combustion  of  COG  with  varying  compositions.  As  shown  in
Figs. 46 and 47, for different gas compositions, the transition to MILD
combustion occurred when N2 and CO2 were used as dilution gases and
oxygen  concentration  was  10–12  %  and  13–15  %,  respectively.  The
increase in H2  concentration (or the decrease in CH4 concentration) in
the gas mixture led to the transition to MILD combustion because of the
reduction  of  oxygen  concentration.  Under  the  MILD  combustion  con-
ditions  with  different  diluents,  the  measured  NO  emissions  were
significantly  reduced.  When  it  was  close  to  the  MILD  state,  the  CO
emission  decreased  gradually,  while  it  increased  marginally  near  the
LFL. Under N2 dilution, CO could reach a single-digit ppm level in MILD
mode, while CO2 dilution could lead to marginally higher CO emission,
which was attributed to the decomposition of CO2 at high temperature.
Kwiatkowski [50] studied two types of BGGs, one from waste wood
chips and the other from poultry feathers. Three types of burners were
used in the experiments and simulations, including additional air inlets,
cross  jets,  and  cyclic  cross jets  (Fig.  32).  The  results  show  that  MILD
combustion  is  possible  only  when  the  fuel  is  highly  diluted  and  pre-
heated. The analysis shows that the gas produced by poultry feathers
contains more N2  and is fully diluted, but the BGG produced by waste
wood chips has less N2  and is not fully diluted. Therefore, most of the
BGG obtained from the gasification of waste wood chips is burned in the
conventional flame mode. Even if the EGR rate is significantly high, it is
challenging  to  establish  MILD  combustion.  Further,  even  if  the  pre-

is  very  high,

Our  previous  study  investigated  the  visual  observations,  pollutant
emissions, and OH-PLIF of BGG MILD combustion (Fig. 48) [144]. Both
chemiluminescence  and  OH  distributions  proved  that  the  hot  coflow
increased the angle of the inner boundaries of the BGG jet flames. The
reaction zone widened and moved outward in the radial direction. The
hot coflow causes local self-ignition upstream, which leads to the com-
bustion zone moving upstream. As the equivalence ratio increases, the
effects of the coflow become more significant. Under MILD combustion,
CO emissions can be reduced by 43%–70 %, and NOx emissions can be
reduced by 63%–81 % under different conditions. The hot coflow can
promote  the  oxidation  of  CO,  which  reduces  CO  emissions.  The  CO
emission decreases with an increase in the equivalence ratio. The control
of residence time is crucial for reducing CO emissions. The hot coflow
can  dilute  the  BGG  and  establish  MILD  combustion  to  reduce  NOx

emissions.  The  NOx  produced  by  the  CH4-air  flame  can  be  partially
reduced by BGG.

Zornek  et  al.  [43]  studied  the  performance  of  Turbec  T100  MGT
system  equipped  with  a  MILD  combustor  (Fig.  34).  Reliable  start-up
procedures  and  steady-state  operation  were  observed.  When  the  LHV
of BGG was 5 MJ/Nm3, the power generated by the gas turbine could
reach 50–100 kW, as shown in Fig. 49. When compared to natural gas,
the electrical power (Pel) output of BGG at constant turbine speed was
significantly higher. The pressure loss of the BGG was maintained below
4 %, which is 30 % lower than that of natural gas. In the whole operation
range, low pollution emissions were obtained, i.e., CO < 30 ppm, NOx
<6 ppm, and UHCs <1 ppm. The primary factors limiting BGG in the
MGT  were compressor surging  and the  limits  of the  power electronic
systems.  By  ignoring  these  two  factors  in  numerical  simulations,  the
maximum power output could even be increased to 137 kW.

The  influence  of  BGG  composition  on  MGT  operation  was  further
studied. BGG (PG1, PG3, PG4) with different compositions are listed in
Table 10.  The turbine speed selected was 82.5 %, because the power
electronic systems, stability limit, and fuel supply system demonstrated
the maximum range at this speed. With the decrease in LHV of BGG, the
fuel  mass  flow  rate  increased  by  54  %  from  PG1  to  PG4.  The  power
generation efficiency remained unchanged owing to a 7 % increase in
both electrical power output and thermal power input. Higher fuel mass
flow increased the pressure in the combustion chamber; therefore, the
compressor  provided  less  air.  With  the  decrease  in  LHV,  its  working
point moved to the stability limit but was still in the stable region. In
terms of pollutant emissions, no significant changes were observed. This
further  shows  that  the  MILD  combustor  has  good  stability  and  fuel
flexibility. It cannot be ignored that with the decrease in LHV, the lim-
itations of the electrical power will gradually increase, and the stability
limit  will  also  broaden.  Therefore,  optimizing  the  electrical  power
output and stability range for BGG in the actual MILD combustion of
MGT is necessary.

5. Modeling of MILD combustion and its application to LCVG

The combustion process involves flow transport, species mixing, heat
transfer, chemical reactions, and their interactions. Numerical simula-
tions of these various processes provide information about variables that
are  unmeasured  or  difficult  to  measure  in  experiments.  Different  nu-
merical simulation approaches have been used to study MILD combus-
tion processes. These include zero-dimensional (0D) [22,121,145,146]

and  one-dimensional  (1D)  [147,148]  simulations  employing  detailed
chemical  kinetic  models,  as  well  as  two-dimensional  (2D)  and
three-dimensional  (3D)  CFD  simulations.  2D and  3D CFD  simulations
often require the use of reduced chemical kinetic models to maintain a
reasonably short computational time. In Section 5.1, various chemical

kinetic mechanisms reported in the literature for numerical simulations
of LCVG combustion are discussed.

In practical combustion devices, the flow is often turbulent. In MILD
combustion, turbulence plays an important role in mixing hot coflow,
internal,  and  external  EGR  with  the  reactants.  The  structures  of  the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10116327

S. Zhou et al.

[155]  used  the  KEE  mechanism  [156]  and  the  DRM-19  mechanism
[157]  to  describe  the  oxidation  path  of  the  CH4/H2  mixture  in  a  nu-
merical simulation. The DRM-19 mechanism is a subset of the GRI-Mech
mechanism.  The  KEE  mechanism  always  performs  better  than  the
DRM-19 mechanism in all cases.

Wang et al. [158] developed a skeletal CH4/H2 combustion mecha-
nism from a CH4 oxidation mechanism of Smooke and Giovangigli [159]
containing 16 species and 25 reactions, based on which key reactions
involving H2  was studied. H2  is involved in the reaction through three
elementary reactions:

O + H2 → OH + H

H2 + OH → H2O + H

CH3 + H2 → CH4 +H

Through  the  entropy  generation  analysis  of  CH4/H2/air,  it  was
shown that the contribution of H + O + M = HO2 + M and HO2 + H =
OH  + OH  increased  with  the  increase  in  H2  mass  fraction,  while  the
contribution of CH3 + O = CH2O + H decreased. In the low-temperature
region of 400–800 K, the volumetric entropy generation rate is primarily
controlled by H + O2 + M → HO2 + M and H + HO2 → H2 + O2. In the
high-temperature region of 1200–1600 K, it is primarily controlled by
CH3 + O = CH2O + H.

Li et al. [148] used a directed relation graph with an error propa-
gation (DRGEP) method combined with extensive validation for 0D, 1D,
and 2D simulations supported by sensitivity and rate-of-production an-
alyses to evaluate and reduce the Aramco Mech 2.0 [160] and Konnov
mechanisms [161,162] for CH4/H2 flames. The measured ignition delay
time and laminar burning velocity were used to evaluate and verify the
accuracy of the mechanisms. The results showed that the two detailed
chemical reaction mechanisms demonstrated good prediction accuracy.
A two-stage  DRGEP method  and  reaction  reduction method  based  on
singular computational perturbation were then implemented to achieve
two  skeletal  models.  The  skeletal  mechanism  generated  based  on  the
Aramco Mech 2.0 mechanism includes 25 species and 105 reactions; the
skeletal mechanism generated based on the Konnov mechanism consists
of 27 species and 107 reactions. Broad applicable conditions of these
skeletal mechanisms were reported, i.e., φ = 0.5–2.0, Tu = 900–2000 K,
p = 1–50 bar. 2D RANS simulation of the flame structure with the two
skeletal mechanisms was performed using OpenFOAM CFD code. Except
for the mass fractions of OH and CO, the performance of the two skeletal
mechanisms  was  similar.  Further  chemical  and  sensitivity  analysis  of
laminar  flame  structure  showed  that  in  Aramco  and  Konnov  mecha-
nisms, three important reactions, i.e., CO + OH = CO2 + H, H2 + OH =
H + H2O, and CH4  + OH = CH3  + H2O, have different rate constants,
which  may  be  the  reason  for  the  difference  in  prediction  of  CO  con-
centration distribution.

By only considering the dilution effect of CO2, Watanabe et al. [163]
studied the fuel-rich combustion of CH4 in an O2/CO2 environment. The
results showed that CO2  could promote the oxidation of CH4. The spe-
cific  reaction  is  CO2  + H  →  CO  + OH.  Under  fuel-rich  combustion
conditions, hydrocarbons primarily react with H radicals to produce H2.
Simultaneously,  hydrocarbons  also  react  with  OH  to  produce  H2O,
creating a competitive relationship between the two reactions. With the
increase in the H/OH ratio, the production of H2 is enhanced, while CO2
participates  in  the  reaction  to  convert  H  into  OH,  which  reduces  the

reaction zones are fundamentally different from those of conventional
flames. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) has been used to investigate
the structures of the reaction zones and modes of combustion in MILD
combustion, and the results are discussed in Section 5.2. DNS provide a
complete description of the turbulent combustion process, as detailed
turbulence eddies and chemical reaction zones are resolved with a fine
CFD mesh.

DNS  results provide  insight into  the interaction  between  chemical
reactions and turbulence, forming the basis for developing models for
Turbulence and Chemistry Interaction (TCI) for Large Eddy Simulation
(LES)  and  Reynolds-Averaged  Navier-Stokes  (RANS)  simulations.  In
Section 5.3, various TCI models for LES and RANS of MILD combustion
are  reviewed.  In  Section  5.4,  a  literature  survey  of  LCVG  MILD  com-
bustion studied using various numerical approaches is conducted, aim-
ing to provide a deeper understanding of LCVG MILD combustion.

5.1. Chemical kinetics for LCVG combustion

The chemical reaction mechanisms employed in numerical simula-
tions  of LCVG combustion will  be discussed in  this section, including
detailed  and  reduced  mechanisms.  For  LCVG  combustion,  several  re-
searchers have used GRI-Mech mechanisms to predict the combustion
process.  GRI-Mech  is  an  optimised  mechanism  to  model  natural  gas
combustion, including NO formation and NO-reburning chemistry. The
mostly  used  GRI-Mech  is  the  GRI-Mech  3.0  mechanism  [149],  which
contains  325  reactions  and  53  species.  The  results  showed  that
GRI-Mech  3.0  mechanism  is  applicable  to  LCVG  under  rather  limited
conditions [9,97,150–152]. For example, Natarajan et al. [56] showed
that with the increase in preheating temperature of the CO/H2 mixture,
neither the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism nor a specific H2/CO mechanism
[153] could predict the value of laminar burning velocity reported in
experiments.

Ziani  et  al.  [154]  used  GRI-Mech  2.11  to  study  the  influence  of
pressure  on  the  non-premixed  turbulent  combustion  of  the  CH4/H2
(80/20)  mixture  (LHV  of  28.7  MJ/Nm3).  The  temperature  prediction
was reasonable at 1 atm; however, at 3 atm, the temperature prediction
was  significantly  higher  than  the  experimental  value.  Parente  et  al.

H/OH ratio. Therefore, CO2  can reduce the production of H2, promote
the production of H2O, and then promote the oxidation of CH4.

To evaluate the ability of GRI-Mech 3.0 to predict  NOx formation
characteristics  of  a  CH4/H2/CO  air  reverse-flow-based  non-premixed
flames, Park et al. [97] conducted a numerical study. The results indi-
cated that the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism is consistent with the measured
peak level of NO and the distribution of mole fraction over a relatively
wide range of H2/CO compositions and strain rates.

Using reaction significance analysis, Fischer et al. [164] evaluated
the  applicability  of  several  common  mechanisms  to  LCVG  (primarily
biogas  and BGG).  These  mechanisms include GRI-Mech  3.0, DRM-19,
mechanisms  by  Frenklach  [165,166]  and  Heghes  [167],  and  NUIG
[168–170]. The mechanisms proposed by Frenklach extended the GRI
mechanism to pyrolysis conditions. The mechanism proposed by Heghes
involves the oxidation of C1–C4 hydrocarbon fuels. The NUIG mecha-
nism considers the combustion of C1–C5 hydrocarbons. The numerical
results  were  compared  with  the  shock-induced  ignition  experimental
data  of  Petersen  et  al.  [171]  for  CH4/H2  mixtures  at  pressures  of
20.3–23.5 bar and the shock tube ignition experimental data of Huang
et al. [172] for CH4/air mixtures at relatively high pressures (16–40 bar)
and preheated temperatures (1000–1350K). The numerical simulation
with the NUIG mechanism agrees with the experimental data of Petersen
et al. In contrast, the GRI-based mechanisms predicted results in poor
agreement with the experiments. The predictions of the ignition delay
time of Huang et al. using all five mechanisms have high accuracy at
higher temperatures but not at lower ones. The effects of fuels compo-
sitions, dilutions, temperature, and pressure on the difference between
measured and predicted values were analysed. In general, most mech-
anisms can capture the combustion of biogas reasonably well; however,
most mechanisms perform poorly for the combustion of BGG. The NUIG
mechanism is the best one to simulate the combustion of BGG, for a wide
range  of  temperature,  combustible  components,  dilution  components,
and pressure conditions. At high temperatures, all mechanisms exhibi-
ted  improved  performance  in  the  presence  of  N2,  especially  the
GRI-Mech  3.0.  However,  at  low  temperatures,  the  presence  of  N2  re-
duces the predictive accuracy of all mechanisms.

Olm et al. [24] collected 408 datasets and 4970 data points from 52
works of literature on LCVG combustion and compared several common
mechanisms of LCVG combustion. These data include the measurements
of ignition delay time in shock tubes (732 data points/62 datasets) and
fast  compressors  (492/47),  measurements  of  burning  velocities

(2116/217), and measurements of species concentration in flow reactors
(1104/58), shock tubes (436/21) and jet-stirred reactors (90/3). These
experimental data were used to test 16 LCVG combustion mechanisms,
as listed in Table 11. The average error function E is defined as follows:

mechanisms were identified to reproduce the experimental data satis-
factorily, in descending order of overall performance. Specifically, the
best  mechanism  for  predicting  ignition  delay  time  is  the  Li-2015
mechanism  [177],  the  Davis-2005  mechanism  [153]  for  burning  ve-
locities, and the NUIG-NGM-2010 [173] mechanism for the concentra-
tion distribution.

Xie et al. [78] showed that the elementary reactions H + O2 = O +
OH and OH + CO = H + CO2 are the most critical chain branching re-
actions with positive sensitivity coefficients when CO is relatively low
for CH4/CO/O2/CO2  mixtures. CO oxidation is increasingly important
with the increase in CO content in the CH4/CO blends. When CO con-
centration exceeds 0.9, the importance of reaction OH + CO = H + CO2
is significantly greater than that of H + O2 = O + OH. CO oxidation is the
primary  control  factor  for  CH4/CO/O2/CO2  mixture  combustion.  The
most  important  positive  and  negative  sensitivity  reactions  for  the
H2/CO/O2/CO2 mixtures are OH + CO = H + CO2 and H + O2 (+M) =
HO2 (+M). With the addition of CO, the sensitivity coefficient of OH +
CO = H + CO2 first increases and then decreases.

Several researchers have developed reduced mechanisms for LCVG
combustion.  Lee  et  al.  [178]  proposed  a  reduced  chemical  reaction

mechanism for H2/CO/CH4/CO2  mixtures. This mechanism was devel-
oped  based  on  the  ignition  delay  time  data  of  the  H2/CO/CH4/-
CO2/N2/H2O mixtures under 90 different experimental conditions as the
optimization  index  of  the  genetic  algorithm  and  making  use  of  the
optimised subset from the Aramco Mech 1.3 mechanism [179] (devel-
oped  for  C1–C5  hydrocarbon  and  oxygen-containing  fuels,  including
325  species  and  2067  reactions).  The  resulting  reduced  mechanism
consists of 72 species and 290 reactions. The reduced mechanism is in
good agreement with the Aramco Mech 1.3 mechanism [179] in pre-
dicting the combustion characteristics of the H2/CO/CH4/CO2 mixtures,
with the maximum relative errors of 2.75 % in the ignition delay time.
According to Lee et al., the reduced mechanism can be applied to predict
the  combustion  characteristics  of  biogas  and  other  LCVG.  For  the
CO/H2/H2O/CH4/CO2  mixtures  with  a  low  content  of  H2/CH4  and  a
high content of H2O, Nikolaou et al. [180] proposed a reduced mecha-
nism with five steps and nine species. The mechanism of Nikolaou et al.
[180] consists of the following reactions:

O2 + H2O + 3CO → 2H + 3CO2

CO2 + H2 → H2O + CO

2H + CO2 → H2O + CO

O2 + 2H2O + 2CO → 2H + 2CO2 + H2O2

2H + 4CO2 + CH4 → 3H2O + 5CO

The mechanism was initially used for the simulation of combustion
of  BFG.  BFG  contains  multiple  components  such  as  CO/H2/CH4/CO2,
usually has a low content of H2 and CH4 and a high content of H2O, and
is similar to the composition of BGG. This reduced mechanism is derived
from a skeletal mechanism consisting of 49 reactions derived from an
improved subset of GRI-Mech 3.0. The mechanism of Nikolaou et al. was
verified  for  predictions  of  laminar  burning  velocities,  ignition  delay
times, and flame structures. The skeletal mechanism and the five-step
reaction  mechanism  showed  good  consistency  in  numerical  simula-
tions of LCVG for a wide range of pressures (1–20 atm) and temperatures
(298–700 K).

In  our  previous  studies  [14,77],  the  laminar  burning  velocities  of
biomass-derived gas mixtures (including BGG, pyrolysis gas, biogas, and
syngas) were simulated using GRI-Mech 2.11, GRI-Mech 3.0, and San
Diego  mechanism  [181],  and  the  results  were  compared  with  the
experimental data. The uncertainty and scattering of the results were
investigated. The results showed a reasonable consistency between the
predictions from these mechanisms and the experimental data regarding
the laminar burning velocities; the difference under most conditions was
within 7 %.

5.2. Reaction zone structures in MILD combustion - DNS studies

In conventional flames, such as diffusion flames or premixed flames,
chemical  reactions  typically  occur  in  thin  layers  characterized  by
distinct  chemical  reaction  zones  and  heat/mass  transfer  zones  [182,
183].  However, in  MILD combustion, there is  no clear  separation be-
tween  the  reaction  zone  and  the  heat/mass  transfer  zone.  Minamoto
et  al.  [44,184–186]  conducted  DNS  of  MILD  combustion  using  pre-
heated  and  EGR-diluted  lean  premixed  CH4/air  mixtures,  as  well  as
premixed flames in undiluted lean premixed CH4/air mixtures. The re-
sults revealed that regions with strong chemical activity in MILD com-
bustion are distributed over a substantial portion of the computational
domain, unlike in the premixed case where these regions are confined to
a  small  portion  of  the  domain.  Fig.  50  shows  that  there  are  multiple
combustion  modes  in  MILD  combustion,  including  premixed  flame
propagation,  spontaneous  ignition  wave  propagation,  and  closely
entangled premixed flames and ignition waves. Similar multiple modes
have been observed in DNS of preheated lean H2/air combustion at high
pressures (preheated initial temperature of 1070 K, equivalence ratio of

0.1, and pressure of 41 atm) [187,188]. The existence of these multiple
combustion modes poses challenges to the application of conventional
models for TCI in simulating MILD combustion, as will be discussed in
Section 5.3.

Several researchers have reported DNS dedicated to MILD combus-
tion [44,118,184,189–191]. A recent review on DNS of MILD combus-
tion  has  been  provided  by  Minamoto  et  al.  [192].  A  summary  of  the
major findings in these DNS studies is given below.

Van Oijen conducted DNS of CH4/H2  MILD combustion in hot oxi-
dizers (mixtures of O2/N2/H2O/CO2, with a temperature of 1300K), in a
2D  configuration  similar  to  a  JHC  burner.  The  oxygen  and  nitrogen
concentrations in the oxidizers were varied to control the temperature
rise during combustion. The results show that scalar gradients affect the
ignition  time,  and  the  high-temperature  chain  branching  reactions
associated with hydrogen chemistry dominate the ignition process. The
ignition process is also affected by differential diffusion. Due to the very
small  stoichiometric  mixture  fraction  in  the  studied  CH4/H2/oxidizer
mixtures, the reaction zones lie at the edges of the shear layer, and the
structures of the reaction zones are not strongly affected by turbulence.
This results in a reaction zone that is not as distributed as in the work
reported by Minamoto et al. [185], as shown in Fig. 50. The low oxygen
concentration case was further studied in a 3D DNS with a more realistic
initial  temperature  profile  to  mimic  the  heat  loss  effect  [189].  The
DRM-19 mechanism [157] was used in the DNS. It was found that heat
loss and differential diffusion effects are crucial in predicting the igni-
tion delay, flame structures, and heat release rates. The MILD combus-
tion process is initiated by autoignition, and the subsequent propagation
of the reaction zones is due to different ignition delays along the most
reactive mixture fraction. The authors also compared 2D DNS and 3D
DNS results and found that the 3D results encompass more small-scale
structures and species variations, affecting the ignition delay times.

Doan  et  al.  [184]  conducted  DNS  of  MILD  combustion  involving
non-premixed CH4 and EGR-diluted oxidizers using a 58-step chemical
mechanism that are based on the mechanism of Smooke and Giovangigli
[159]. Similar to lean premixed MILD combustion [185], the structure
of  the  reaction  zones  revealed  the  presence  of  ignition  fronts  (where
heat/mass transfer is significantly weaker than chemical reactions), lean

and  rich  premixed  flames,  and  non-premixed  combustion  during  the
combustion process. The proportion of these three modes was influenced
by the average oxygen molar fraction. The DNS data were further ana-
lysed using Lagrangian particles to track the evolution of fluid elements
as they underwent ignition or flame propagation under MILD conditions
[118]. It was found that MILD combustion starts from autoignition in
regions  with  lean  mixtures  at  the  upstream  of  the  domain  where  the
ignition delay times are low, and reaction zones propagate into richer
mixtures  either  as  a  flame  or  ignition  wave.  This  process  is  highly
dependent  on  the  mixture  fraction  length  scale,  and  autoignition  is
favored when the length scale is small. The DNS data were also used to
investigate the criteria for MILD combustion [190]. In a conventional
non-premixed  flame,  the  reaction  zone  temperature  varies  with  the
scalar dissipation rate (SDR) during the ignition inception stage, i.e., the
temperature increases as the SDR decreases until the onset of ignition,
which is known as the low-branch of the S-curve. It was found that in
MILD combustion, the low-branch is not present; namely, the reaction
zone  temperature  increases  with  increasing  SDR,  and  the  S-curve  is
degenerated  to  a  C-curve.  This  is  due  to  the  influence  of  chemically
active free radicals present in the incoming stream, which results in an
ignition promotion effect of high SDR.

DNS data contain a huge amount of information that can be explored
using various tools, such as Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP)
and Tangential Stretching Rate (TSR), Chemical Explosive Mode Anal-
ysis (CEMA), and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Manias et al. [193]
used CSP and TSR to analyze the DNS results of MILD combustion of lean
premixed  EGR-diluted  CH4/air  mixtures  [185].  In  MILD  combustion
regions  with  fairly  distributed  reactions,  TSR  was  found  to  be  an
excellent diagnostic tool for depicting regions of significant activity. The
MILD combustion system is mostly dissipative in nature, as the chemi-
cally explosive modes are largely suppressed by the dissipative action of
transport. On the other hand, convective transport associated with tur-
bulent eddies plays a key role in bringing the explosive nature into the
system.

Doan  et  al.  [194]  used  CEMA  to  analyze  the  contribution  of
self-ignition  and  flame  modes  to  MILD  combustion  of  premixed  and
non-premixed  CH4  and  EGR-diluted  mixtures  [184,185].  In  premixed
MILD  combustion,  the  dominant  combustion  mode  is  self-ignition.  In
non-premixed MILD combustion, the ignition mode depends on the axial
position and mixture fraction stratification. When the mixture fraction
length  scale  is  large,  ignition  occurs  upstream  and  then  propagates
downstream.  When the  mixture  fraction length  scale  is small, contin-
uous autoignition occurs.

ML  algorithms  have  been  utilized  to  analyze  DNS  data  of  MILD
combustion  in  order  to  explore  combustion  phenomena.  Dave  et  al.
[195]  employed  an  unsupervised  clustering  algorithm  called  Vector
Quantization  Principal  Component  Analysis  (VQPCA)  to  characterize
the non-premixed MILD combustion using the DNS data of Doan et al.
[184]. Two DNS datasets with oxygen concentrations of 3.5 % and 2.0 %
were studied. The DNS data, containing thermo-chemical information,
were  fed  to  VQPCA,  which  partitioned  them  into  a  few  clusters.  A
comparison of VQPCA clusters and physical variables, such as mixture
fraction or heat release rates, demonstrated the potential of VQPCA in
interpreting and characterizing the combustion systems.

5.3. Recent advances in CFD modelling of MILD combustion

DNS may be considered a model-free numerical simulation approach
as it resolves the turbulence eddies and fine reaction zones, albeit being
based on simplified chemical kinetic models and idealized inflow and
initial conditions. The high computational demand in resolving the flow
and reaction length and time scales in DNS makes it not applicable to
simulate real systems such as MILD combustion devices. RANS and LES
are alternatives to DNS in performing numerical simulations of practical
combustion  processes,  for  example,  burners  for  MILD  combustion,  as
shown in Refs. [120,196–200].

Reynolds averages in RANS and spatial filtering in LES are employed
to reduce computational costs. In both approaches, the fine turbulence
scales  and  reaction  zones  in  turbulent  combustion  are  not  simulated,
reducing the need for very fine mesh in the simulations. The turbulence
and chemistry interaction (TCI) not simulated in RANS and LES has to be
modelled. Perpignan et al. [201] discussed various TCI models for MILD
combustion, including.

• Eddy  Dissipation  Model  (EDM)  [202,203],  in  which  the  mixing
rate is modelled using the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation
rate.

• Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) Model [204], which assumes that
chemical reactions occur in small vortices, and the reaction time is
controlled  by  the  survival  time  of  small  vortices  and  the  time
required by chemical reactions themselves.

• Tabulated  Chemistry  Models  such  as  the  Flamelet-Generated
Manifold  (FGM)  method  [183]  or  Flamelet/Progress  Variable
Approach  (FPVA)  [205],  in  which  a  laminar  flame  structure  is
considered and all important thermo-chemical properties and source
terms  are  tabulated  as  a  function  of  a  few  independent  variables
using  detailed  chemistry.  In  these  approaches,  turbulent  chemical
interaction  is  considered  using  the  presumed  probability  density
function (PDF) of flamelet control variables.

• Conditional  Moment  Closure  (CMC)  [206]  and  Conditional
Source Estimation (CSE) [207], which uses conditional averages to
compute  the  chemical  source  term,  while  the  conditional  fluctua-
tions are assumed to be negligible.

• Transported  PDF  Model  (TPDF)  [208],  in  which  transport  equa-
tions for the joint probability density functions (PDF) of scalars (with
or  without  velocity  components)  are  solved  to  obtain  a  fully
description of the turbulent combustion process.

• Chemical Reactor Networks (CRNs) Models [209], in which the
flow  field  is  not  resolved  in  detail  but  is  modelled  as  a  few
well-stirred reactors interconnected as  a  network. In each  reactor,
the mass flow rate and residence time are specified, and the model’s
overall performance depends on the network specification.

In addition, several other models have been used in the literature for

the simulation of MILD combustion.

• Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR) Model [210,211], in which each
computational cell is split into two regions: a reacting zone and a
non-reacting  zone.  The  mean  (or  filtered)  cell  reaction  rate  is  ob-
tained based on mass exchange between the two regions.

• Steady and Unsteady Flamelet Models [212], which is based on
the  assumption  that  the  thermo-chemical  properties  can  be
expressed as a function of a few flamelet variables.

Coelho  and  Peters  [212]  applied  a  steady  flamelet  model  and  an
unsteady  flamelet  model  (the  so-called  Eulerian  Particle  Flamelet
Model,  EPFM)  in  a  RANS  simulation  of  methane/air  combustion  in  a
MILD  burner.  They  found  that  the  steady  flamelet  model  could  not
correctly  describe  the  formation  of  NO  since  it  is  a  chemically  slow
process. The unsteady flamelet model, however, could capture the cor-
rect order of magnitude of NO emissions.

Rebola et al. [213] assessed the performance of several TCI models in
a RANS simulation of non-premixed methane/air combustion in a MILD
burner,  similar  to  the  jet  in  preheated  air  (JPA)  burner.  The  models
studied included the EDM coupled with Well-Stirred Reactor/Finite Rate
Chemistry (WSR/FR), EDC, steady diffusion flamelet model, a level-set
G-equation based partially premixed flamelet model, and the Coherent
Flame Model of Zimont [214] for partially premixed combustion. The
GRI 2.11 mechanism was used in the simulations. In the recirculation
zone, all models showed fairly good results in predicting temperature
and  mass  fractions  of  CO2  and  O2.  However,  the  models  produced
different  results  in  the  near  burner  regions,  where  the  EDC  based  on

finite rate chemistry yielded results in close agreement with the exper-
iments, while the flamelet model and  CFM model provided poor pre-
dictions. The EDM/FR model predicted similar results to that of EDC,
indicating  that  in  MILD  combustion,  direct  coupling  of  finite  rate
chemistry is needed in CFD simulations. The predictions of CO and NOx
were poor for all models studied; the reason for this is still unclear.

Lee  et  al.  [215]  performed  RANS  simulations  of  CH4/H2  MILD
combustion in the JHC burner of Dally et al. [122] using the GRI 2.11
mechanism.  Turbulence/chemistry  interaction  was  modelled  using  a
multi-environment  PDF  (MEPDF)  model.  In  this  model,  the  direct
quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) is adopted as an alternative
approach to solving the transported PDF equations, which offers a sig-
nificant  reduction  of  the  computational  cost  required  by  the
Monte-Carlo particle-based PDF solution method. It was shown that the
MEPDF  model  could  predict  the  effects  of  oxygen  mass  fraction  on
lift-off,  auto-ignition,  reaction  zone  structure,  and  NOx  emission  of
CH4/H2 MILD combustion in the JHC burner. The method replicated the
sensitivity of the peak levels of CO and CO2 to the variations in oxygen
concentration and fluctuating peak levels under MILD combustion. The
model could also capture the temperature and CO concentration fluc-
tuations  on  the  lean-fuel  side  where  local  extinction  occurred  due  to
mixing of cold air to the vitiated flame field.

Graca  et  al.  [216]  conducted  RANS  simulations  of  natural  gas
non-premixed combustion in a MILD combustion burner experimentally
studied by Castela et al. [217] using the EDC model and the TPDF model.
They also employed several chemical kinetic mechanisms, including the
DRM-19 and the GRI 1.2 mechanisms. The EDC and TPDF models yiel-
ded similar results, and the predicted temperature and mass fractions of
major species were generally in good agreement with the experiments.
The  main  discrepancy  between  the  simulations  and  experiments
occurred  in  the  near  burner  region,  where  both  the  EDC  and  TPDF
models predicted a delayed combustion process. This discrepancy may
be attributed to the use of the RANS model, which failed to capture the
complex  flow and mixing processes near the burner, where  the recir-
culated hot flue gas and reactants blend. High-fidelity approaches such
as LES may be necessary to properly capture this process.

LES is widely used in the analysis of MILD combustion. When com-
bined with finite rate chemistry and the PaSR model, LES is considered
to be a high-fidelity simulation method at present. Lu et al. [200] used
the  LES-PaSR  method  to  simulate  turbulent  methane/hydrogen  jet
flames  under  MILD  conditions,  employing  detailed  chemical  kinetics.
The predicted combustion field statistics were in good agreement with
the measurements, including temperature and mass fractions of major
and minor species. This showed significant improvement compared to
some previous simulations.

Li et al. [218] conducted a comparison of LES-predicted results using
the  PaSR  model  and  two  implicit  combustion  models,  namely  the
quasi-laminar  finite  rate  (QLFR)  model  and  laminar  finite  rate  (LFR)
model,  with  experiments  for  CH4/H2  MILD  combustion  in  the  JHC
burner of Dally et al. [122]. The QLFR and LFR models are similar to the
well-stirred  reactor  (WSR)  or  perfectly  stirred  reactor  (PSR)  model,
where  mean  reaction  rates  are  evaluated  using  filtered  quantities,
neglecting the impact of fluctuations in the Sub-Grid Scales (SGS). The
results  showed  that  the  QLFR/LFR  models  yielded  good  predictions,
similar to the PaSR, in terms of temperature and species mass fractions.
It  is  noteworthy  that  in  MILD  combustion,  the  reaction  zones  are
spatially distributed (as discussed in Section 5.2), and the spatial vari-
ation  of  temperature  and  composition  in  MILD  combustion  is  signifi-
cantly lower than in conventional flames. This may be the reason for the
success of these  implicit combustion models,  which neglects the  fluc-
tuations in the SGS scales, in simulating MILD combustion.

Englmann  et  al.  [219]  studied  non-premixed  methane/air  MILD
combustion  in  a  multi-regime  burner  [220]  using  LES  with  a  FGM
model.  The  grid  resolution  used  was  higher  than  conventional  LES,
enabling  accurate  predictions  for  variables  that  are  challenging  to
forecast, such as CO mass fraction. When compared with RANS coupled

with finite-rate chemistry models like EDC and TPDF, high-resolution
LES coupled with a simpler and computationally less demanding FGM
tabulation approach seemed to offer better accuracy. This improvement
could  be  attributed  to  the  better-resolved  scalar  fields.  However,  this
conclusion needs to be verified in other MILD burner simulations, such
as the ones studied by Graca et al. [216].

The  PaSR  model  differs  from  WSR/PSR  or  EDC  models  in  its
approach to accounting for the effect of turbulence on mean or filtered
reaction rates. Ferrarotti et al. [221] conducted a comprehensive anal-
ysis of the PaSR mixing sub-models in RANS simulations of MILD com-
bustion in the JHC burner of Dally et al. [122]. The mixing time scale
was represented using three models: a simple model based on integral
time scale fractions, a fractal-based mixing model, and a dynamic mix-
ing model based on solving the transfer equation of scalar variance and
dissipation rate. The performance of the dynamic model surpassed that
of the static model and fractal model, achieving accurate predictions in
terms of average temperature, CO, and OH mass fractions at Reynolds
numbers of 5000, 10000, and 20000.

Wang  et  al.  [222]  conducted  RANS  simulations  of  CH4/H2  MILD
combustion  in  the  JHC  burner  of  Dally  et  al.  [122]  using  the  TPDF
approach for two conditions: a low O2 concentration MILD case (3 % O2)
and a higher O2  concentration conventional flame case (9 % O2). The
TPDF  simulations  accurately  predicted  the  temperature  and  species
distributions,  including  the  distributions  of  OH,  CO,  and  NO.  It  was
found that the mixing model constant in the TPDF model is crucial for
MILD combustion simulations: a higher value leads to fast mixing inside
the shear layer between the fuel jet and hot coflow, resulting in a higher
peak  temperature  and  a  corresponding  shift  of  the  peak  towards  the
coflow. For the flame case, the combustion process in the near-burner
region is more sensitive to chemical reactions, and the flame is in its
initiation  stage.  In  the  downstream region,  the  combustion process  is
controlled by mixing, which is characteristic of non-premixed flames.

Li  et  al.  [223]  evaluated  the  PaSR  and  EDC  models  in  LES  of
non-premixed  methane/air  MILD  combustion  in  the  inverse  diffusion
flame  (IDF)  burner  of  Veríssimo  et  al.  [130].  The  overall  prediction
performance of PaSR model was better. The EDC model underestimated
the average temperature and CO2 molar fraction, and overestimated the
O2 molar fraction. This may be the effect of EDC parameters.

Mardani et al. [224] developed a new local method for optimizing
the EDC combustion model based on turbulent Reynolds number and
Damk ̈ohler number, and dynamically adjusted the length and time scale
constants  of  the  model  for  each  unit  of  the  calculation  domain.  The
model  was  tested  on  two  experimental  burners,  JHC  and  DJHC.  This
method improved the results by more than 13 % in the region with high
Damk ̈ohler number.

Several authors have attempted to further develop the FGM and EDC
models  for  MILD  combustion.  Huang  et  al.  [225]  proposed  a  Diluted
Air-FGM (DA-FGM) model based on the use of non-premixed flamelets
diluted  on  the  air  side.  The  DA-FGM  model  introduces  an  additional
control  parameter:  air  dilution  level.  In  a  RANS  simulation  of
non-premixed MILD combustion of CH4/C2H6/N2/CO2 in preheated air
in a burner similar to the jet in preheated air (JPA) burner. The predicted
velocity and temperature data are highly consistent with experimental
LDA and CARS data, considering not only the fluctuations of mixture
fraction but also the fluctuations of process variables.

Romero-Anton  et  al.  [226]  developed  a  Novel  Extended  Eddy
Dissipation Concept model (NE-EDC) and compared it with the previous
Extended EDC model (E-EDC), the standard EDC model, and the FGM
model.  The  E-EDC  and  NE-EDC  models  differ  from  the  standard  EDC
model in that the two key model constants depend on the local Reynolds
number and the Kolmogorov scale Damk ̈ohler number. The difference
between E-EDC and NE-EDC lies in the assumptions about the length
scale of the fine structure. The results show that the NE-EDC prediction
results  are  most  consistent  with  the  experimental  data,  slightly
improved compared with the E-EDC model, and significantly improved
compared  with  the  standard  EDC  model  and  the  FGM  model.  The

S. Zhou et al.

velocity and turbulence predictions of the NE-EDC and E-EDC models
are very close, and the average temperature results in the lower part of
the furnace were also very similar, with differences only in the upper
part of the furnace.

ML algorithms have been used to analyze DNS data of MILD com-
bustion, to improve model accuracy, and train new models. Chen et al.
[227] used deep neural networks (DNN) machine learning algorithms to
train  prediction  models  of  joint  filtered  density  functions  (FDFs)  of
mixture  fraction  and  progress  variables  under  MILD  combustion  con-
ditions.  Since  the  reaction  zones  are  more  distributed  in  MILD  com-
bustion than that in conventional flames, the FDFs exhibit non-regular
(neither Gaussian nor bi-modal) distributions and strong cross correla-
tions, which cannot be described using analytical FDFs. This implies that
care has to be made when using the presumed PDF coupled with flamelet
tabulations.

Iavarone et al. [228] evaluated the performance of the PaSR model
for computing LES filtered reaction rates and heat release rates under
MILD conditions in an a priori test using the DNS data of Doan et al.
[184]. PaSR accurately predicted the heat release rate and reaction rates
of major and minor species. The mixing time scale was found to have the
highest impact on the predictions of the filtered reaction rates for the
investigated  cases.  The  best  performance  was  achieved  by  the  PaSR
formulation employing the dynamic approach for the mixing time scale
and  the  formation  rate  estimation  for  the  chemical  time  scale.  This
finding is consistent with the work of Ferrarotti et al. [221].

5.4. Numerical simulation of LCVG MILD combustion

5.4.1. COG (CH4/H2)

Several  authors  have  conducted  numerical  simulation  of  non-
premixed CH4/H2  MILD combustion in the JHC burner of Dally et al.
[122] to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of H2 content in the
fuel, CO2 content in the oxidizer on MILD combustion of CH4/H2.

Afarin and Tabejamaat [229] performed LES to explore the effect of
H2 on the reaction zone structure of non-premixed CH4/H2 MILD com-
bustion in the JHC burner of Dally et al. [122] using a PaSR model [210]
and the GRI-Mech 2.11 mechanism. They discovered that decreasing the
hydrogen content in the fuel from 40 % to 10 % resulted in a lower peak
flame  temperature,  a  lower  OH  mass  fraction,  a  higher  CH2O  mass
fraction, and extinction of the reaction zone near the burner. Due to the
reduced reactivity of the fuel resulting from the decreased H2 content in
the CH4/H2 mixture, the MILD combustion mode is enhanced.

Tu et al. [101] studied the effect of diluent CO2 on MILD combustion
in the JHC burner of Dally et al. [122] through a RANS simulation with
the EDC model and the GRI-Mech 2.11 chemical kinetic mechanism. The
N2  and CO2  concentrations in the hot co-flow oxidizer were varied to
explore the impact of N2  and CO2  on the MILD combustion of the fuel
(CH4/H2). It was demonstrated that CO2  is superior to N2  in achieving
MILD combustion in the JHC burner due to both physical and chemical
effects. With the increase in CO2  concentration in the hot co-flow, the
contribution  of  the  physical  effects  of  CO2  on  temperature  reduction
becomes stronger, while that of the chemical effects on the reduction of
OH and CH2O gradually weakens.

Several authors have used numerical simulations to gain insights to
the chemical reaction paths in MILD combustion. Mardani et al. [145]
used  CFD  simulation  and  zero-dimensional  analysis  to  study  the  for-
mation of CO and CO2 in CH4/H2 MILD combustion in the JHC burner of
Dally  et  al.  [122].  The  CFD  simulations  with  the  RANS  model  and
zero-dimensional  well-stirred  reactor  (WSR)  simulations  were  carried
out with the chemical reaction mechanism DRM-22 [230]. The results
showed that under MILD combustion, the chemical routes of conversion
of CH3 to higher hydrocarbons (such as ethane) were activated, and the
higher hydrocarbon oxidation pathways were effective in CO and CO2
formation. This implies that the CH4 low-temperature reaction pathway
is activated under MILD combustion conditions. The ratio of the rate of
CO  formation  reaction  (O  + C2H2  ⇔  CH2  (s)  + CO)  on  the  ethane

oxidation route to that of the CO consumption reaction (OH + CO ⇔ H
+ CO2) on the main route changes with the change in oxygen concen-
tration. The reaction rate of the acetylene oxidation is higher than that of
the CO oxidation at higher oxygen concentrations, but it is the opposite
at  lower  oxygen  concentrations.  When  the  temperature  is  lower  than
1500 K, the increase in temperature will increase the concentration of
CO2 and decrease the concentration of CO. However, the effect of tem-
perature  on  the  concentration  of  CO  and  CO2  is  reversed  when  the
temperature is higher than 1500 K.

Ali et al. [121] carried out zero-dimensional simulations in a WSR
using Chemkin-Pro software and GRI-Mech 2.11 mechanism to study the
effect of different H2  content on NOx formation mechanisms and reac-
tion routes in CH4/H2 MILD combustion. The results showed that adding
H2  enhanced  the  NNH  path  and  suppressed  the  prompt  NO  and
N2O-intermediate NO paths, as shown in Fig. 51. The chemical effect of
H2  on the NOx generation pathway varied with the change in oxygen
mass  fraction.  When  the  mass  fraction  of  oxygen  was  3  %,  the  NNH
route’s relative contribution was increased by adding H2. Conversely,
when the  mass fraction of  oxygen was  6 % and  9 %, adding H2  only
enhanced the N2O-intermediate route and reduced the contribution of
other routes to the total NOx emission.

Li  et  al.  [146]  studied  the  effect  of  reactor  temperature  and  H2
concentration on the NOx formation in CH4/H2 MILD combustion using
experiments,  RANS  simulations  with  EDC  model,  and  WSR  chemical
kinetic simulations. The GRI 2.11 mechanisms were used in the simu-
lations. As shown in Fig. 52, when the mass fraction of H2  in the fuel
increased from 5.7 % to 14.4 %, the NOx emissions remained unchanged
despite  the  increase  in  the  average  temperature  of  the  furnace.  The
thermal NO mechanism could not explain this. RANS and WSR simula-
tions showed that when the equivalence ratio was 0.8, the N2O-inter-
mediate path dictated NO formation; moreover, the NO reburning was
also significantly strong. With the increase in the H2 concentration, the
importance  of  the  NNH  path  increased,  while  the  importance  of  the
prompt route decreased; therefore, the NOx emission was not affected.
The WSR chemical kinetic simulations showed that the conversion of NO
to NO2 was significant at low temperatures in MILD combustion; further,
the relative importance of NO2 in total NOx emission increased. With the
increase in reactor temperature from 1100 K to 1600 K, the importance
of  the  N2O-immediate  path  decreased,  while  the  importance  of  the
thermal NO path increased.

Sepman  et  al.  [113]  studied  the  NO  emission  in  CH4/H2  MILD
combustion in a laminar JHC burner, focusing on the source of N in NO.
The GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism was used and improved for NO chemistry.
It was shown that the distribution of NO generation primarily occurred
from NO formation in coflow and hardly occurred from the N2  in the
fuel. This indicated that diluting a large amount of N2 in the fuel did not
increase the NO emission. In addition, the experimental results showed
that NO decreased significantly at the height of 6 mm in the chamber
due to the conversion of NO molecules to N-intermediate products and
then to NO downstream of the chamber.

To evaluate the low noise advantage of MILD combustion, the sound
power level of MILD combustion under different mass fractions of CH4/
H2 fuel, inlet temperatures, and inlet Reynolds numbers were studied by
Mousavi et al. [231]. GRI-Mech 2.11, the renormalisation group (RNG)
k-ε turbulence model and the EDC model were used. It was found that
the increase in oxygen mass fraction leads to an increase in the sound
power level, and it is the direct source of noise generated in the com-
bustion  process.  With  the  decrease  in  the  maximum  temperature  of
MILD  combustion,  the  increase  in  inlet  fuel  temperature  reduces  the
turbulence intensity and sound power level in the reaction zone. Adding
H2  in  the  fuel  results  in  a  decrease  in  sound  power,  which  seems  to
contradict the fact that the adiabatic combustion temperature of CH4 is
lower than that of H2, as discussed in Section 2.1. The reason is that with
the increase in H2, the mass fraction of CH4  in the mixture decreases;
therefore,  the  blended  fuel’s  LHV  and  overall  thermal  power  are
reduced.  This  decreases  the  reaction  zone  temperature  and  the

and  CO2  dilutions  is  45  %  and  76  %,  respectively.  Therefore,  it  is
concluded that H2O as diluent is better than N2 and CO2 in reducing NO
emission, as shown in Fig. 54.

5.4.2. Biogas

Different  burners,  e.g.,  WSR,  OPPDIF,  and  MGT,  in  the  computa-
tional  studies  of  biogas  MILD  combustion  have  been  reported.  Wang
et al. [22] reported numerical simulations of CH4/O2/N2 combustion in
a WSR using GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism. The extinction temperature (Tex)
and  Tsi  of  the  CH4/O2/N2  mixture  were  determined  based  on  the

prompt,  N2O-intermediate,  and  reburning  routes.  Reprinted  from  Ref.  [146]

concentration of OH radicals, and the reaction zone moves toward the
nozzle. It was shown that heat release is a direct source of noise emis-
sions. The sound power level of MILD combustion decreases with the
increase in inlet Reynolds number and the decrease in heat release.

Shu et al. [104] performed numerical studies of MILD combustion of
CH4 in hot diluted oxidizer coflow in a JHC burner, focusing primarily
on NO emission. The results showed that when compared to N2 dilution,
H2O  and  CO2  dilutions  could  significantly  reduce  NO  emission.  For
example, under the same dilution level, the maximum NO emissions in
MILD combustion under N2, CO2, and H2O dilutions were 58, 4.8, and
1.8 ppm, respectively. The physical and chemical effects of H2O or CO2
worked together to reduce NO emissions. However, the former is more
important than the latter, as shown in Fig. 53. Since the concentration of
oxygen is significantly lower in the case of H2O dilution, the chemical
effect of H2O is more significant than that of CO2  in reducing NO pro-
duction. Therefore, even if the maximum combustion temperature with
H2O dilution is higher than that with CO2 dilution, the NO emission with
H2O  dilution  is  significantly  lower.  The  contribution  of  N2O-inter-
mediate mechanism to the reduction of NO emissions in the cases of H2O

ignition-extinction S-curve. Based on Tex, Tsi, and the operating condi-
tions  (Tin  and  the  mixture  composition),  the  WSR  combustion  of
CH4/O2/N2  can be quantitatively classified into several regimes: tradi-
tional combustion (TC), high-temperature combustion (HTC), and MILD
combustion.  MILD  combustion  can  be  further  divided  into  three
sub-regimes:  MILD,  MILD-like,  and  quasi-MILD,  as  shown  in  Fig.  55.
Both the overall mechanism and elementary chemical pathways of CH4
oxidation depend strongly on TWSR and φ, and weakly on the combustion
regime. This conclusion is derived from analysing the fuel conversion to
the composition of the WSR products under various initial conditions.
Zou et al. [147] carried out a detailed numerical simulation of biogas
combustion  in  an  OPPDIF  burner  configuration  [232]  with  simulta-
neously diluted and preheated oxidant and fuel. The effects of the EGR
rate,  equivalence  ratio,  and  inlet  temperature  on  CO  formation  were
studied.  The  EGR  rate  was  simplified  by  adding  N2  into  the  fuel  and
oxidant. The results show that increasing the EGR and decreasing the
equivalence  ratios  under  MILD  combustion  can  reduce  CO  emission;
however, the effects are weakened when the EGR ratio exceeds the value
of six. CO emission decreases considerably from the critical state to the
MILD combustion state with the increase in EGR and equivalence ratios.
According to the sensitivity analysis, the CO formation was primarily

controlled by the elementary reaction, OH + CO  ⇔  H + CO2, in the
MILD combustion regime. Sidey et al. [233] used a fuel mixture fraction
and hot product oxidiser to investigate biogas MILD combustion using
the  OPPDIF  model.  Both  prompt  and  thermal  NO  were  identified  to
contribute to the overall NO produced in the MILD regime. The reverse
reactions in the thermal NO mechanism reduced the NO already present
in the hot product oxidiser.

Mameri et al. [138,234] studied the influence of several operating
conditions (i.e., biogas composition, hydrogen enrichment, and oxidizer
dilution) on the laminar MILD combustion structure and emissions in a
numerical simulation of the OPPDIF burner configuration, using the GRI
3.0 chemical kinetic mechanism. It was found that both the temperature
and  pollutant  emissions  were  reduced  when  CO2  was  present  in  the
oxidant stream. The temperature of 10 % H2-doped CH4 is more sensi-
tive  to  the  chemical  effects  of  CO2.  With  the  increase  of  CO2  in  the
oxidant, the impact of CO2  on the maximum temperature is insignifi-
cant. Under MILD combustion, the chemical effects are negligible since
the oxidant requires a large amount of CO2.

Several  authors  have  conducted  CFD  simulations  of  biogas  MILD
combustion  to  explore  the  impact  of  composition  of  biogas  on  the
combustion and emissions, and to evaluate the accuracy of combustion
models.  Hosseini  et  al.  [196]  conducted  a  CFD  study  on  MILD  com-
bustion of biogas in a PJFF burner. The biogas is a mixture of CH4 (60 vol
%) and CO2 (40 vol%). For comparison pure methane combustion was
also studied. RANS simulations were carried out using a two-step global
reaction model and the EDM with the standard k–ε turbulence closure
model. A discrete ordinates model was used for radiation heat transfer.
Thermal NO and prompt NO mechanisms were taken into account for
NOx modelling. The six points’ temperatures on the combustion cham-
ber’s central axis were simulated and verified. The experimental tem-
perature  data  were  in  good  agreement  with  the  simulation  data.  The
EDM/global chemistry models appear to give reasonable predictions of
the heat release process in both the conventional and MILD combustion
of biogas and the trend of NOx emission. However, due to its simplified
treatment  of  turbulence/chemistry  interaction,  the  prediction  of  fuel
consumption  and  CO2  formation  was  very  rapid,  leading  to  poor  CO
emission prediction. Both diffusion flame mode and MILD combustion
mode were simulated. As shown in Fig. 56, in the conventional diffusion
flame mode, NOx emissions increase with the preheated air inlet tem-
perature. The NOx emission from the methane flame exhibits a much
higher sensitivity to inlet temperature than the biogas flame, owing to
the high sensitivity of flame temperature in the methane flame. In the
MILD  (flameless)  combustion  mode,  both  methane  and  biogas  com-
bustion  showed  low  NOx  emissions,  with  biogas  MILD  combustion
having a NOx emission of less than 1 ppm.

were performed to simulate the combustion and heat transfer [235]. For
the air–fuel combustion scenarios, the simulations show good agreement
with  the experimental data in both furnace temperature and  incident
radiative heat flux profiles. The maximum and average relative errors of
furnace  temperature are 3.86 % and 1.78 %, respectively. Under this
experimental condition, the consistency between the furnace simulation
and  experimental  data  is  better  by  reducing  the  parameters  of  EDC
model from the default values of 0.134 and 0.5 to 0.0167 and 0.03.

Ilbas et al. [236] performed RANS simulations, in which PDF/Mix-
ture Fraction combustion model and the standard k-Ɛ turbulence model
were used to investigate the emission behaviours. Under the condition of
CO2 dilution, NOx emission is greatly reduced. Cameretti et al. [49] used
an  eight-step  reaction  mechanism  proposed  by  Novoselov  and  Malte
[237] to simulate biogas MILD combustion in a premixed lean MGT. The
fuel oxidation is modelled with a three-step global mechanism, and the
NO  formation  is  modelled  using  5  global  reactions  derived  from
different NO mechanisms. The CFD results were used to understand the
impact  of  pilot  fuel  injection  and  EGR  on  the  combustion.  The  CFD
model provided reasonable results of the local temperature peaks and
the fuel/air ratios in different regions of the MGT combustor. The model,
however over-predicted the NO emission.

5.4.3. Syngas

Pramanik  et  al.  [238]  numerically  investigated  N2-diluted  syngas
MILD  combustion.  Four  combinations of  models  have  been  examined
comprising  RANS/DES  (detached  eddy  simulation)  for  flow  and
FGM/EDC  model  for  turbulence-chemistry  interaction.  In  general,
DES-EDC model performs best because it has excellent flow resolution
and  detailed  solution  of  species  migration  equation.  FGM  model
consistently predicted early ignition, including RANS and DES.

Huang et al. [128] studied the MILD combustion of syngas using a
CRN model and GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism. According to the prediction
of the CRN model, the NOx emission of MILD combustion was relatively
low compared to the classical diffusion combustion. NO formation in the
adiabatic  flame  below 1565 K  was  predominantly due to  the N2O-in-
termediate mechanism.

Zornek  et  al.  [43]  developed  a  numerical  simulation  program  to
analyze  the  steady-state  performance  of  an  MGT  Turbec  T100.  The
program  is  based  on  the  model  of  each  MGT  component  and  a  large
amount  of  experimental  data  collected  on  the  MGT  test  bench.  The
compressor  and  turbine  diagrams  are  embedded  in  the  program,
considering the regenerator efficiency, heat loss, pressure loss, conver-
sion loss, and other losses from generators and power electronics. The
program calculates temperature, pressure, mass flow rate, gas compo-
sition,  and  specific  data  of  each  component.  It  also  evaluates  the

performance of each component and the entire system for various fuel
compositions.

Chinnici et al. [239] carried out RANS simulations of syngas MILD
combustion  using  the  realisable  k-ε  model,  EDC  model  with standard
EDC  coefficients,  and  detailed  H2/CO  chemistry  (POLIMI  H2/CO
mechanism,  which  consists  of  14  species  and  33  reactions  [240])  as
turbulence  closure,  turbulence-chemistry,  and  chemistry  models,
respectively.  To  isolate  the  sole  effect  of  syngas  composition  on  the
MILD  combustion  process,  a  fixed  wall  temperature  of  1000  K  was
specified. The Damk ̈ohler number was used to conduct an analysis of the
MILD combustion process of syngas and H2, which is defined as follows:

Da =

τf
τr

,

(11)

where τf  and τr  are the flow and chemical reaction time scales, respec-
tively.

τf = (ν/ε)1/2

τr = [O2]

/

Rkin,O2

(12)

(13)

Here, ν, ε, Rkin,O2  are kinematic viscosity, turbulent dissipation, and the
reaction rate of oxygen, respectively. The increase of the H2/CO ratio
leads to a decrease in the peak values of Da and OH, and this trend is
non-linear. This indicates that the presence of CO in the mixture reduces
the reactivity of the system, thereby acting as a diluent. The maximum
difference between the calculated and experimental results is less than 4
%, indicating that the model is suitable for studying the heat transfer and
primary  combustion  characteristics  of  the  syngas  MILD  combustion
process in the device.

The numerical results of Chinnici et al. [239] shows the effect of the
H2/CO ratio on the performance of H2/CO MILD combustion. Under all
the conditions analysed, there were almost no pollutant emissions (NOx
and CO emissions <20 ppm). The rise of H2/CO ratio in the fuel stream
only marginally increased the NOx emission; moreover, it significantly
broadened the range of stable and MILD operation conditions. As shown
in Fig. 57, the decrease in H2  in the syngas leads to a decrease in the
maximum  Damk ̈ohler number  and  OH  mole  fraction. Meanwhile,  the
reaction zone is broadened to be closer to the outlet of the device. Thus,
under  MILD  conditions,  CO  in  the  syngas  mixture  acts  as  a  ‘diluent’
when  compared  to  pure  H2.  The  composition  of  syngas  affects  the
relative  importance  of  heat  transfer  from  radiation  and  convection.
Syngas shows higher emissivity than pure H2, although the total thermal
efficiency and radiation heat transfer of syngas is smaller than that of H2
owing to the lower average gas temperature.

Shaker et al. [241] numerically investigated the MILD combustion of
syngas  in  different  oxidizers:  O2/CO2,  O2/CO2/N2  and  O2/N2.  Fuel
composition,  oxidizer  temperature  and  oxygen  mole  fraction  were
investigated as the main parameters. The results show that the chemical
effect  of  oxidizer  composition  changing  from  N2  to  CO2  is  the  main
reason for the change of flame structure, ignition delay time IDT, and
heat  release  rate  at  high  preheating  temperature,  while  the  physical
effect  plays  a  more  prominent  role  in  MILD  combustion  at  low  pre-
heating temperature.

5.4.4. CGG and BGG

Furst et al. [242] studied the applicability of eight mechanisms for
MILD combustion of biomass pyrolysis gas in a plug flow reactor. The
composition of biomass pyrolysis gas is 1 % C2H4, 2 % ethane, 10 % CH4,
25 % CO, and 62 % CO2. The experimental data were obtained from the
PFR, and the ignition delay time was of primary concern. None of these
mechanisms could adequately describe the ignition delay time. A new
chemical kinetic scheme was proposed based on the optimization of the
rates for the three most important reactions are reaction R1 (O2 + H = O
+ OH), R271 (HO2 + CH3 = OH + CH3O), and R405 (CH4 + H = H2 +
CH3). The optimised rate constants are compared with the original ones
in Table 12. This improvement was verified to have a good effect and
agrees with the experimental data.

Zhou et al. [243] numerically investigated the self-ignition temper-
ature of the BGG/O2/N2  mixture over wide ranges of residence times,
oxygen  concentrations  (in  oxidizer),  and  equivalence  ratios  using  the
detailed mechanism of NUIG-NGM-2010 in PSR for the application of
MILD  combustion.  The  ignition  process  is  extremely  sensitive  to  the
oxygen  concentration  and  Tsi  decreases  with  the  increase  of  oxygen
concentration. A new MILD combustion diagram is proposed, as shown
in  Fig.  58.  When  the  oxygen  concentration  is  lower  than  the  critical
oxygen concentration, MILD combustion can be established if Tin > Tsi.
When the oxygen concentration is higher than the critical oxygen con-
centration, it may occur MILD combustion and high temperature com-
bustion. In this case, Tin needs to be controlled to reduce the temperature
rise. For BGG the critical oxygen concentration is 11.7 %, which is larger
than CH4  (9.7 %). This indicates that BGG is  more likely  to establish
unconditional MILD combustion than CH4 under the same conditions.
It should be noted that very few CFD simulations of CGG/BGG MILD
combustion  have  used  these  detailed  mechanisms  due  to  the  high
computational  cost  required  when  using  the  detailed  mechanisms.

concentration  and inlet temperature.  Reprinted from  Ref. [243] with  permis-
sion from Elsevier.

Global and reduced mechanisms are preferred; however, these mecha-
nisms’  accuracy  must  be  verified.  Fortunato  et  al.  [142]  applied  a
reduced mechanism to predict the NOx formation in MILD combustion
of COG and B50 LCVG. The reduced mechanism, derived for the specific
conditions  of  the  MILD  combustion  regime,  contains  the  relevant NO
formation  pathways,  including  thermal  NO  as  well  as  N2O  and  NNH
pathways. The mechanism was compared with the one-step global re-
action  of  NO  formation  pathways.  The  performance  of  the  reduced
mechanism is significantly better than that of the global mechanism. In
particular,  NOx  emissions  are  greatly  overestimated  when  using  the
global reaction. Under MILD combustion, the error of global reaction is
two orders of magnitude higher than that of the reduced mechanism.
The  results  provided  by  the  reduced  mechanism  are  closer  to  the
experimental values.

6. Concluding remarks and future development

This paper provides a review of recent studies on LCVG MILD com-
bustion. The combustion of LCVG in traditional combustors presents a
challenge. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of fuel
composition on the key combustion characteristics of LCVG, particularly
on  MILD  combustion  processes.  The  establishment  methods  of  LCVG
MILD combustion and different burner designs were discussed in detail.
The flame state and pollutant emissions of different LCVG under MILD
combustion were also compared. The numerical simulation models for
MILD combustion were introduced, and the application of CFD simula-
tions to LCVG MILD combustion was reviewed. The aim of this paper is
to  gain  a  consistent  and  deeper  understanding  of  the  physical  and
chemical  processes  in  LCVG  MILD  combustion  and  to  identify  future
research  needs.  The  conclusions  of  this  review  are  summarised  as
follows.

coflow.  On  the  other  hand,  ΔT < Tsi  is  primarily  achieved  by
oxidant dilution, and external and internal EGR.

(3)  Heating value: With the decrease in the LHV of LCVG, achieving
Tsi < Tin  becomes  more  challenging,  while  achieving  ΔT < Tsi
becomes  more  straightforward,  and  NOx  emissions  are  lower.
When the air-fuel ratio of LCVG is less than one, preheating the
fuel  can  also  be  considered  to  establish  and  maintain  MILD
combustion more effectively.

(4)  Pollution: Under the same thermal input power, MILD combustion
has significantly lower NOx emissions than traditional combus-
tion.  Although  the  burner  may  have  the  capability  to  achieve
MILD combustion, it is crucial to adjust the optimal conditions to
each specific fuel in order to achieve the lowest possible levels of
pollutant emissions.

In terms of the effect of LCVG composition on MILD combustion, the

In terms of the fundamental combustion characterisations of LCVG as

following aspects are observed.

a fuel, the following aspects are noted.

(1)  The flammability limits (FL) of LCVG: Dilutions of CO2 and N2 can
significantly reduce the FL. The FL is strongly influenced by the
temperature and preheating the reactants can increase the FL of
LCVG,  which  is  an  important  approach  to  consider  in  MILD
combustion.

(2)  Laminar  burning  velocity:  CO2  and  N2  can  reduce  the  laminar
burning  velocity  of  LCVG,  with  CO2  having  a  more  significant
impact. H2 has a high laminar burning velocity, and the laminar
burning velocity of LCVG increases with the increase of the H2
content  in  the  fuel.  Preheating  reactants  and  increasing  the
equivalent ratio in the lean mixture can both enhance the laminar
burning velocity.

(3)  Chemical kinetics: Various combustion mechanisms developed for
small  hydrocarbon  fuels  have  been  utilized  to  describe  the
chemical reactions of LCVG. However, due to the high dilution
level  and  low  combustion  temperature  of  LCVG,  these  mecha-
nisms were found to predict the combustion and emission pro-
cesses differently.

(4)  Ignition  delay  time:  The  high  reactivity  of  H2  can  promote  the
ignition of the LCVG mixture, and accordingly, an increase in CH4
and CO content will increase the ignition delay time. In contrast,
N2 and CO2 have been shown to increase the ignition delay time.
Several  parameters,  including  pressure,  temperature,  equiva-
lence ratio, can affect the ignition delay time.

(5)  Stability: Thermoacoustic instability of LCVG can occur during the
operation  of  a  lean  gas  turbine,  and  the  fuel  composition  can
affect  the  location  and  intensity  of  combustion  instability.  In
particular,  the  presence  of  H2  has  been  found  to  increase  the
instability.

(6)  Combustion temperature: Adding H2  can increase the combustion
temperature and lead to an increase in NO production through
four different routes. However, it can also decrease CO produc-
tion and improve combustion efficiency. On the other hand, CO2
and N2  can inhibit NOx generation by reducing the combustion
temperature and residence time.

(1)  Effect of H2: H2 has a shorter ignition delay and a faster laminar
burning velocity than CH4, which enhances its ignition and flame
propagation  capabilities.  Therefore,  adding  H2  to  LCVG  will
advance the combustion time and shift the combustion zone up-
stream. H2  can be used as an additive to LCVG to increase the
flammability of the mixture and enable the complete oxidization
of the hydrocarbons. The addition of H2 also increases the adia-
batic combustion temperature; therefore, achieving MILD com-
bustion  with  ultra-low  NOx  emissions  requires  significant
dilution, high jet velocity, or high EGR rate.

(2)  Effect of diluents: The dilution effect of CO2, N2, and H2O on MILD
combustion  involves  both  physical  and  chemical  effects.  The
dilution effect is ultimately reflected in the oxygen concentration
of the reactants after mixing. When considering the physical ef-
fects, CO2  and H2O have higher heat capacity than N2, which is
conducive  to  reducing  the  overall  temperature  of  the  reaction
zone. This has an obvious advantage for reducing NOx emissions.
With regard to chemical effects, CO2 and H2O lead to a broader
reaction zone and can promote the reactivity or provide highly
reactive radicals. Therefore, they can promote the establishment
of MILD combustion. However, the most critical factors affecting
NOx  emissions  are  the  oxygen  concentration  and  the  air  pre-
heating temperature.

(3)  Syngas: Pure syngas composed of CO and H2 behaves differently
than CH4. This is because CO has a higher self-ignition temper-
ature  and  lower  laminar  burning  velocity  compared  to  CH4,
which is in contrast to that of H2. As a result, H2 plays a crucial
role in promoting the oxidation of CO, which is a key factor for
improving the efficiency of the MILD combustion of syngas.
(4)  CGG and BGG: CGG and BGG have complex compositions and the
equivalent air-fuel ratios are close to 1. Therefore, burner design
and  operating  conditions  must  be  optimised  for  efficient  com-
bustion.  Despite  their  low  calorific  value,  these  fuels  can  still
establish MILD combustion, e.g., in MGT. Additionally, achieving
ultra-low emissions of CO < 30 ppm, NOx <6 ppm, and UHCs <1
ppm is easier due to the sufficient dilution of the fuel itself.

In  terms  of  combustor  design  and  establishment  of  LCVG  MILD

In terms of the numerical simulations and modelling of LCVG MILD

combustion, the following aspects are noted.

combustion, the following can be noted.

(1)  Effect of dilution: For LCVG, a significant amount of dilution gas
can increase the self-ignition temperature and ignition delay time
of the mixture. Therefore, preheating of reactants is crucial. The
concept of “MILD” is well-suited for LCVG.

(2)  Criteria of MILD combustion: Tsi < Tin  can be achieved by reactant
preheating,  internal  EGR  introduced  by  jet,  swirling  flow,  and
reverse flow, and external EGR using a heat exchanger and hot

(1)  Advances in MILD combustion models: DNS has been employed in
the study of MILD combustion to identify different combustion
modes and analyze reaction zone structures. Additionally, DNS
has been instrumental in developing and evaluating TCI models.
LES,  RANS  simulations,  and  relevant  TCI  models,  along  with
chemical kinetic mechanisms, have been extensively investigated
for  simulating  LCVG  MILD  combustion.  The  reaction  zone  in
LCVG  MILD  combustion  is  distributed,  making  traditional

flamelet  models  generally  unsuitable  for  accurate  predictions.
High-resolution  LES  combined  with  FGM  has  demonstrated
promising  accuracy  in  predictions.  However,  this  approach  re-
quires  further  verification  across  a  broader  range  of  cases  to
establish its reliability. Models that couple finite-rate chemistry,
such as PaSR, EDC, and TPDF, have shown good prediction ac-
curacy. Among these models, PaSR and EDC are more commonly
used due to their lower computational demands when compared
to TPDF.

(2)  Chemical  reaction  mechanisms:  The  GRI-Mech  and  its  reduced
mechanisms  are  predominantly  adopted  for  modelling  MILD
combustion. While suitable and verified mechanisms such as the
NUIG mechanism exist for LCVG, they are not currently applied
for modelling LCVG MILD combustion.

(3)  NOx formation mechanism: In terms of NOx formation, extensive
studies have only been conducted for CH4/H2 mixtures. The NOx
formation mechanism for this mixture includes thermal, prompt,
N2O-intermediate,  and  NNH  pathways,  all  of  which  are  influ-
enced by changes in composition and operating conditions during
MILD combustion.

For  future  research  and  development,  the  following  has  been

identified.

(1)  There is still no consensus on the definition of MILD combustion.
The definition proposed by Cavaliere and de Joannon [33] based
on temperature, has been widely used and has played a signifi-
cant role in the development of LCVG MILD burners. However,
there are other MILD burner configurations that do not align with
the  definition  provided  by  Cavaliere  and  de  Joannon.  Future
research is necessary to establish a comprehensive definition and
criterion for MILD combustion. This effort is crucial to unify the
various  approaches and  methods  used  in  the  field  and  provide
clear guidelines for the development of burners tailored specif-
ically for LCVG MILD combustion.

(2) A  substantial  portion  of  current  research  on  LCVG  MILD  com-
bustion has been concentrated on syngas and biogas, primarily
because of their relatively simple compositions. However, further
research  is  essential  for  other  LCVG  types,  like  CGG  or  BGG,
which  possess  more  complex  compositions.  This  additional
research is necessary to identify the conditions required for MILD
combustion  establishment,  validate  MILD  burner  designs,
perform experimental quantification of the combustion process,
and develop chemical kinetic and CFD models.

(3)  The  experiments  conducted  by  Dally  et  al.  [122]  on
non-premixed CH4/H2 MILD combustion in the JHC burner have
yielded significant insights into the transition from flame to MILD
combustion. These experiments have also provided valuable data
for  validating  CFD  models.  There  is  a  pressing  need  for  more
experimental research of this nature for various LCVG and MILD
combustion  burners.  Moreover,  in  addition  to  measuring  tem-
perature, major species, and minor species (such as CO and NOx),
it is highly desirable to employ laser-based experiments to study
MILD combustion indicator species (such as OH, CH2O, and CH)
within  the  combustor.  These  experiments  are  essential  for
developing criteria for MILD combustion.

(4)  Numerical  simulations of  LCVG  MILD  combustion  demonstrate
high  accuracy  in  predicting  major  species  and  temperature.
However,  the  accuracy  drops  significantly  when  it  comes  to
predicting  minor species such as CO and NOx. To enhance the
precision of predicting these minor species in LCVG MILD com-
bustion, there is a need for improvements in current TCI models
and  chemical  kinetic  mechanisms  describing  the  chemistry  of
NOx and CO.

(5)  Future research efforts are required to develop both detailed and
reduced  chemical  kinetic  mechanisms  specifically  tailored  for

LCVG, encompassing the intricacies of NOx chemistry under low-
temperature MILD combustion conditions. Currently, many nu-
merical simulations rely on chemical kinetic mechanisms origi-
nally  designed  for  methane  or  natural  gas,  such  as  the  GRI
mechanisms,  even  in  the  context  of  LCVG  MILD  combustion.
However, there is a notable absence of systematic evaluations of
different  mechanisms  for  LCVG.  Dedicated  chemical  kinetic
mechanisms catering to LCVG, accounting for its wide range of
compositional variations, need to be developed.

(6) TCI models, relying on the direct coupling of finite-rate chemis-
try, such as EDC, PaSR, and TPDF, demonstrate reasonably ac-
curate predictions of MILD combustion. However, these models
demand extensive computation time. There is a pressing need to
develop  computationally  efficient  models  like  FGM  and  CMC
with higher accuracy. These advancements are crucial to enable
the application of CFD simulations in the design and optimization
of industrial LCVG MILD combustors.

(7)  DNS has been utilized in the study of MILD combustion of CH4,
offering  a  valuable  opportunity  to  comprehend  combustion
modes and reaction zone structures. It also aids in developing TCI
models for RANS and LES. Extending the use of DNS to investi-
gate MILD combustion of various other LCVG is desirable.
(8)  DNS generates vast datasets that can be challenging to interpret.
Machine-learning  (ML)  methods,  such  as  the  neural  network-
based approaches demonstrated by Jigjid et al. [244,245], have
been  employed  to  identify  local  combustion  modes  in  MILD
combustion. It is crucial to develop more dedicated ML methods
and utilize them for data-mining the DNS data. These methods
can  help  identify  low-dimensional  manifolds  and  facilitate  the
development of TCI models specifically tailored for LCVG MILD
combustion.

Dynamics.  Prof.  Bai  received  his  Ph.D.  degree  in  Fluid  Me-
chanics  from  the  Royal  Institute  of  Technology,  Sweden,  in
1994.  Since  2002  he  has  been  a  professor  in  the Division  of
Fluid  Mechanics,  Department  of  Energy  Sciences  of  Lund
University.  Prof.  Bai  has  published  200+ papers  in  peer-
reviewed  journals.  His  research  interests  include  the  theory
of flame propagation and extinction, mechanisms of pollutant
formation  in  chemically  reactive  flows,  modelling  of  turbu-
lence/chemistry interaction, direct numerical simulation and
large eddy simulation of turbulent reactive flows, modelling of
solid/gas and liquid/gas turbulent two-phase reactive flows, with application to different
energy conversion processes in internal combustion engines, gas turbines, and industrial
furnaces. In 2018, Prof. Bai was elected the Fellow of the Combustion Institute.
