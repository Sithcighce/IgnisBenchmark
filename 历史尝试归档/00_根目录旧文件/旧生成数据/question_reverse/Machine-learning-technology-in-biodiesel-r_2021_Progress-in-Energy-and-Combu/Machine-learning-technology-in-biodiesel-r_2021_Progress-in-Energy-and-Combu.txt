Biodiesel has the potential to signiﬁcantly contribute to making transportation fuels more sustainable. 
Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of processes for biodiesel production and use, fast and accu- 
rate modeling tools are required for their design, optimization, monitoring, and control. Data-driven ma- 
chine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated superior predictive capability compared to conven- 
tional methods for modeling such highly complex processes. Among the available ML techniques, the 
artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) technology is the most widely used approach in biodiesel research. The

ANN approach is a computational learning method that mimics the human brain’s neurological process- 
ing ability to map input-output relationships of ill-deﬁned systems. Given its high generalization capacity, 
ANN has gained popularity in dealing with complex nonlinear real-world engineering and scientiﬁc prob- 
lems. This paper is devoted to thoroughly reviewing and critically discussing various ML technology ap- 
plications, with a particular focus on ANN, to solve function approximation, optimization, monitoring, and 
control problems in biodiesel research. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of using ML technol- 
ogy in biodiesel research are highlighted to direct future R&D efforts in this domain. ML technology has 
generally been used in biodiesel research for modeling (trans)esteriﬁcation processes, physico-chemical 
characteristics of biodiesel, and biodiesel-fueled internal combustion engines. The primary purpose of in- 
troducing ML technology to the biodiesel industry has been to monitor and control biodiesel systems 
in real-time; however, these issues have rarely been explored in the literature. Therefore, future studies 
appear to be directed towards the use of ML techniques for real-time process monitoring and control of 
biodiesel systems to enhance production eﬃciency, economic viability, and environmental sustainability.

1. Introduction 

Over 80% of the global energy requirements are currently sat- 
isﬁed  by  fossil  fuels  such  as  petroleum,  coal,  and  natural  gas 
that  manifest  the  heavy  dependency  of  human  society  on  these 
limited non-renewable energy resources [1–3] . More importantly, 
the increased consumption of fossil fuels has confronted human- 
ity  with  some  of  its  most  signiﬁcant  challenges  throughout  his- 
tory, i.e., environmental deterioration and health problems [4–6] . 
Notably, most environment-degrading and health-detrimental gas 

pollutants are released due to the exploitation, reﬁning, and uti- 
lization of fossil-based fuels [7] . 

Among the various products derived from petroleum, diesel is 
the most commonly used fuel, and its utilization is growing con- 
tinuously around the world due to the higher thermodynamic eﬃ- 
ciency and fuel economy of diesel engines over the petrol counter- 
parts [8] . Fig. 1 shows that the global demand for diesel and gasoil 
(middle distillates) is expected to increase from 1660 billion liters 
in 2017 to 1834 billion liters in 2040 the statistical data released 
by OPEC [9] . This increase is directly associated with the growing

number  of  light-  and  heavy-duty  diesel-powered  vehicles  in  the 
transportation and industrial sectors [10] . Fig. 2 shows the world 
market for diesel-fueled engines from 2018 to 2026. Accordingly, 
diesel engines that emit global warming-causing gases and ozone- 
depleting substances are signiﬁcant contributors to environmental 
problems [11] . The arguments discussed above have led to growing 
needs in improving engine technologies and developing sustainable 
and clean alternative fuels for diesel engines [12] . 

Vegetable oils and animal fats are promising renewable alterna- 
tives to petrodiesel in diesel engines [13] . However, the higher vis- 
cosity of natural oils and fats hinders their widespread application 
in compression ignition diesel engines [14] . Various strategies, in- 
cluding dilution, microemulsion, pyrolysis, and (trans)esteriﬁcation, 
are used to resolve this problem [14] . The dilution approach suf- 

fers from several severe drawbacks, including gum formation, lu- 
bricating oil thickening, partial combustion, injector plugging, at- 
omization  diﬃculties,  high  exhaust  emissions,  high  engine  wear, 
and  so  on  [8] .  The  use  of  microemulsion  fuels  in  diesel  en- 
gines  is  also  associated  with  various  practical  problems  such  as 
heavy  deposition  of  carbon  residue,  inferior  combustion,  irregu- 
lar  injector  needle  sticking,  and  lubricating  oil  thickening  [15] . 
The  pyrolysis  process  of  vegetable  oils  and  animal  fats  requires 
high-cost complex equipment. This process also produces deoxy- 
genated short-chain molecules similar to gasoline [8] . All the chal- 
lenges  mentioned  above  can  be  adequately  resolved  using  the 
(trans)esteriﬁcation process in which vegetable oils and animal fats 
are converted into a diesel-like fuel called “biodiesel” [8] . The rela- 
tively high conversion eﬃciency and reasonably low capital cost of

the (trans)esteriﬁcation process render it one of the most promis- 
ing approaches for facilitating the use of vegetable oils and animal 
fats in diesel engines [16] . 

Among  the  various  renewable  diesel  fuels  developed  to  date, 
biodiesel  is  a  promising  alternative  to  petrodiesel  [17]  because 
of its environmental-friendly properties and favorable social secu- 
rity  beneﬁts  [18] .  Biodiesel  fuel  is  composed  of  long-chain  fatty 
acid  alkyl  esters  prepared  by  transesterifying  triglycerides  (TGs) 
or  esterifying  free  fatty  acids  (FFAs)  with  light  alcohol  in  the 
presence  of  a  base,  acid,  or  enzyme  catalyst  [ 19 , 20 ].  It  should 
be noted that both biodiesel production pathways can be carried 
out without catalyst under supercritical conditions. Biodiesel out- 
performs  petrodiesel  in  terms  of  most  regulated  emissions  ex- 
hausted (i.e., carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC), 
particulate  matter  (PM),  and  smoke)  except  the  emission  of  ni- 
trogen  oxides  (NO x )  [21] .  This  technically-feasible,  economically- 
viable, and environmentally-sound fuel has many advantages over 
conventional  diesel  fuel,  including  reproducibility,  biodegradabil- 
ity,  nontoxicity,  better  lubricity,  lower  ﬂammability,  and  sulfur- 
and benzene-free nature [ 22 , 23 ]. Although biodiesel suffers from 
several  drawbacks  such  as  higher  viscosity,  lower  energy  con- 
tent,  higher  cloud  and  pour  points,  fuel  pumping  diﬃculty,  and 
higher  copper  strip  corrosion  [ 24 , 25 ],  in-use  diesel  engines  can 
be satisfactorily fueled with this biofuel without modiﬁcations or 
with  only  slight  changes  [ 26 , 27 ].  This  issue  could  be  mainly  at- 
tributed to the substantial physico-chemical proximity of biodiesel 
to petrodiesel [28] . Due to the arguments mentioned above, global 
biodiesel  production  has  reached  its  maximum  level  at  the  mo- 
ment, as shown in Fig. 3 . 

A broad spectrum of feedstocks, including virgin vegetable oils, 
waste vegetable oils, animal fats, and non-edible oils, can be used 
to produce biodiesel [ 30 , 31 ]. The share of vegetable oil used for 
biodiesel production is depicted in Fig. 4 . On a global scale, a con- 
siderable  proportion  of  the  produced  vegetable  oil  ( ≈13%  of  the 
total production) is converted into biodiesel. However, using edi- 
ble oils for biodiesel production has been criticized as this strat- 
egy has resulted in a signiﬁcant rise in oil seeds price [32] . Ac- 
cordingly, the food vs. fuel dilemma calls into question the ethics 
of converting edible oils to biodiesel [33] . The use of non-edible 
oils has also raised serious concerns regarding using arable land 
and irrigation water for food or biofuel. In addition to the conven-

tional feedstocks, microalgae are promising biodiesel sources be- 
cause of their high photosynthetic eﬃciency in laboratory culture 
systems [34] . However, the laboratory production rate of microal- 
gae can hardly be realized in commercial culture systems because 
of diﬃculties in simulating the lab-scale conditions. Overall, it can 
be concluded that waste oils/fats are the most preferred feedstocks 
for biodiesel production [35] . 

Biodiesel feedstocks are comprised of a wide variety of long- 
chain fatty acids, remarkably affecting (trans)esteriﬁcation reaction 
and  downstream  puriﬁcation  and  reﬁning  processes.  This  varia- 
tion originates from genetic differences, geographical origins, cli- 
matic  conditions,  breeding  conditions,  and  harvest  season.  Be- 
sides, the (trans)esteriﬁcation process as the heart of any biodiesel 
production system, is a very complex chemical process governed 
by  many  factors  like  reaction  temperature,  reaction  time,  type 
and quantity of alcohol, type and amount of catalyst, process in- 
tensiﬁcation method, reactor geometry, and feedstock type/purity 
[36] .  The  problem  is  likely  to  become  more  severe  due  to  dis- 
turbances  in  reactant  concentration,  working  temperature,  cool- 
ing medium temperature, and ambient air temperature [37] . The 
errors  and  uncertainties  arising  from  instrument  choice,  condi- 
tion,  calibration,  and  environment  can  also  further  complicate 
the (trans)esteriﬁcation process. These result in substantial com- 
plexities in the (trans)esteriﬁcation mechanisms, thereby making 
precise  modeling  of  the  biodiesel  manufacturing  process  more 
complicated  and  sophisticated.  It  is  worth  noting  that  an  ap- 
propriate modeling approach can facilitate ﬁnding the most eﬃ- 
cient (trans)esteriﬁcation methods for various feedstocks, optimiz- 
ing  the  design  and  operating  conditions  of  biodiesel  production 
and reﬁning systems, controlling and adjusting (trans)esteriﬁcation 
conditions  to  boost  the  product  quality,  discounting  operating 
and energy costs, increasing production throughput, allowing for 
greater ﬂexibility in feedstock selection, and bypassing the costly 
and lengthy laboratory experiments like gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry  (GC-MS),  high-performance  liquid  chromatography 
(HPLC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for checking the 
reaction progress. 

Moreover,  the  physico-chemical  attributes  of  the  resultant 
biodiesel  must  be  determined  to  examine  its  suitability  for  ap- 
plication  in  diesel  engines  and  check  its  compliance  with  the 
established  standards  like  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and 
Materials  (ASTM)  and  the  European  norms  (EN).  Cetane  number

dation  stability  (OS),  and  distillation  range  are  the  most  impor- 
tant physico-chemical properties of biodiesel induced mainly by its 
parent feedstock and controlled partly by the production and re- 
ﬁning processes. However, measuring all physico-chemical proper- 
ties of biodiesel using experimental methods is a time-consuming 
and  cost-intensive  task.  It  is  well-documented  that  the  struc- 
tural  features  of  a  given  biodiesel  feedstock  can  well  reﬂect  the 
physico-chemical  properties  of  its  prospective  mono-alkyl  esters 
mix [38] . Accordingly, the estimation of physico-chemical proper- 
ties of biodiesel from its structural features either before or after 
(trans)esteriﬁcation can be viewed as an appealing alternate solu- 
tion to the tedious and expensive experimental measurements. 

To calibrate diesel engines with new fuel blends and ﬁnd op- 
timal engine settings, engine manufacturers and application engi- 
neers are pursuing a broad spectrum of combustion experiments 
with  different  fuel  formulations  under  varying  engine  operating 
parameters  and  environmental  conditions.  The  combustion  tests 
are often carried out to assess the effects of new fuel blends on 
the performance indices, combustion characteristics, and exhaust 
emissions of diesel engines. However, conducting combustion ex- 
periments  under  all  possible  operating  situations  with  different 
engine parameters, fuel cases, and environmental factors is time- 
demanding and cost-prohibitive [39] . Besides, it is impracticable to 
conduct combustion tests outside of limiting values [40] . Instead of 
undertaking numerous combustion tests, mathematical approaches 
can be applied to investigate the diesel engines behavior for ad- 
justing  their  settings  and  optimizing  their  operating  parameters. 
The combustion phenomenon within internal combustion engines 
is a complex multivariate process involving numerous phase trans- 
formation  and  chemical  reactions  along  with  coupled  transient 
ﬂuid ﬂow, heat, and mass transfer processes. In the case of using 
biodiesel fuels in diesel engines, the complexity of the combustion 
process has been proved to be even more challenging due to the 
variations in their ester compounds and physico-chemical proper- 
ties [41] . Therefore, correlating the input parameters of biodiesel- 
fueled engines with their desired outputs, i.e., performance, com- 
bustion, and emission characteristics, using the conventional mod- 
eling techniques, is quite diﬃcult and sometimes impractical. No- 
tably, a robust and reliable modeling system can be an effective 
and economical solution to reduce the number of experiments re- 

quired and, ideally, limit the experimental runs only to the bound- 
ary cases. Such a model can also help arrive at optimum fuel for- 
mulations and engine settings for improved fuel economy and re- 
duced pollutant emissions in in-use diesel engines without design 
modiﬁcations. 

Modeling  (trans)esteriﬁcation  process  can  be  carried  out  us- 
ing phenomenological or mechanistic models by coupling momen- 
tum, heat, mass, and chemical transfer equations and their subse- 
quent simultaneous solution using various mathematical methods. 
However,  computational  intensity  and  numerical  issues  of  these 
approaches have limited their widespread application for model- 
ing and controlling the (trans)esteriﬁcation process. Moreover, the 
physico-chemical properties of biodiesel can be effectively approxi- 
mated using physical models. Like (trans)esteriﬁcation process, im- 
plementing  such  models  is  a  complex  and  computationally  de- 
manding  task.  Additionally,  diesel  engines  fueled  with  biodiesel 
fuels  and  their  blends  with  petrodiesel  can  be  modeled  using 
the widely popularized phenomenological approaches such as ana- 
lytical multi-zone models, multi-dimensional computational ﬂuid 
dynamic  techniques,  and  chemical  reaction  kinetic  models  [42] . 
However,  all  these  idealized  models  have  been  developed  based 
on  numerous  assumptions  and  oversimpliﬁcations,  rendering  it 
extremely  diﬃcult  to  put  their  results  into  practice  [42] .  These 
computational-intensive numerical models require many hard-to- 
estimate/predeﬁne  engine-speciﬁc  parameters  for  a  reliable  sim- 
ulation [42] . In addition, statistical approaches can be applied in 
biodiesel research. However, these methods often suffer from their 
inadequate capability to capture biodiesel systems’ nonlinear and 
dynamic  behavior.  The  availability  of  data  limits  the  usefulness 
and  accuracy  of  statistical  methods  as  well.  Therefore,  eﬃcient, 
fast,  accurate,  and  robust  modeling  approaches  need  to  be  ap- 
plied  to  model  and  control  such  complex  physical  and  chemical 
systems. 

Data-driven machine learning (ML) technology is a promising 
alternative  to  traditional  modeling  approaches  to  deal  with  the 
nonlinear, uncertain, complex, and multivariate nature of biodiesel 
systems.  Among  the  available  ML  techniques,  artiﬁcial  neural 
network  (ANN)  technology  is  the  most  widely  used  method  in 
biodiesel research. Hence, the ANN approach is brieﬂy introduced 
and described in the following section. Fig. 5 shows the number of

studies applying ML technology in biodiesel research. There is an 
ascending trend in the number of published papers during the last 
decade. This increasing trend could not necessarily be attributed 
solely to the interest in using ML technology in this domain but in- 
stead to the availability and maturity of artiﬁcial intelligence meth- 
ods. This powerful tool has been widely used in similar processes 
in  chemical  engineering,  such  as  enzyme-catalyzed  esteriﬁcation 
of adipic acid with oleyl alcohol  [43] , enzyme-catalyzed esteriﬁ- 
cation  of  palmitic  acid  with  xylitol  [44] ,  esteriﬁcation  of  butyric 
acid with n-butanol [45] , catalytic esteriﬁcation of lactic acid with 
isoamyl alcohol [46] , enzyme-catalyzed esteriﬁcation of lauric acid 
with retinyl acetate [47] , enzyme-catalyzed esteriﬁcation of oleic 
acid with triethanolamine [ 4 8 , 4 9 ], enzyme-catalyzed esteriﬁcation 
of ferulic acid with 2-ethylhexanol [50] , enzyme-catalyzed trans- 
esteriﬁcation  of  vinyl  acetate  with  2-phenethyl  alcohol  [51] ,  and 
enzymatic polymerization of ε-Caprolactone [52] . Besides, several 
authors have reviewed and discussed the use of ML technology in 
renewable energy research ( Table 1 ). 

Despite the widespread use of ML technology in biodiesel re- 
search  and  several  review  papers  in  renewable  energy  research, 
there is no comprehensive review paper in the current literature 
on  the  applications  of  this  powerful  technique  in  biodiesel  pro- 
duction, certiﬁcation, and engine application. Therefore, this article 
is  intended  to  systematically  review and  critically  discuss  differ- 

ent applications of ML technology, with a particular focus on the 
ANN approach, in biodiesel research. Moreover, the advantages and 
disadvantages of the developed ML models in biodiesel researches 
are detailed, and suggestions and outlooks are put forward for fu- 
ture works. Even though this paper is devoted to reviewing var- 
ious ML technology applications in biodiesel research, the issues 
and arguments provided herein regarding the present status and 
prospects are of relevance to a broader range of engineering and 
scientiﬁc  ﬁelds.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  mathematical  back- 
ground behind the development of ML models are not illustrated 
herein since such fundamental information and details can be eas- 
ily found in several textbooks [74–79] . 

2. An introduction to artiﬁcial neural network 

Originated from mathematical neurobiology, the ANN approach 
and its hybrids could be promising candidates for coping with the 
nonlinearities and complexities of complicated biological processes 
like  biodiesel  systems,  even  with  uncertain,  noisy,  partial,  and 
missing data patterns. Unlike phenomenological models, the ANN- 
based modeling methods could map complex biological processes 
from a set of examples accurately and quickly without requiring 
the mechanisms and principles behind them. In better words, the 
ANN-based models are capable of modeling complex dynamic sys-

tems with multivariate properties without the need for a proper 
understanding of the detailed underlying physical mechanisms. On 
the other hand, the limited transparency of most of these data- 
driven approaches is the main reason to call the entire portfolio 
of models “theory-free”. In simple terms, the ANN-based modeling 
systems are inspired by the human brain’s neurological processing 
ability [80] . Although there are many kinds of ANN models, they 
all have the same basic principle [81] . 

The human body’s nervous system is formed from billions of 
interconnected neurons with different types and scales depending 
on their location in the body [82] . A biological neuron possesses 
four  principal  functional  parts,  i.e.,  cell  body  (soma),  dendrites, 
axon, and synapses ( Fig. 6 ). The cell body stores the information 
of heredity traits and accommodates the plasma for generating the 
materials required by the neuron [58] . The ﬁber branches of den- 
drites receive the input signals from other neurons and ﬂow them 
towards the cell body. As a connecting line, the axon passes the 
received signals from the cell body towards synapses (microscopic 
gaps) located close to the dendrites or cell bodies of neighboring 
neurons [83] . Proportional to the intensity of the arriving signals 
to the pre-synaptic membrane of the synapse, the vesicles release 
chemical neurotransmitters that are transferred through the synap- 
tic gap and post-synaptic membrane into the dendrites of neigh- 
boring neurons [84] . The receiving neuron is activated to gener- 
ate  a  new  electric  impulse  as  the  intensity  of  the  received  sig- 
nals reaches its particular excitation threshold [53] . With a similar 
mechanism, the produced electric signal moves through the next 
neuron. 

An artiﬁcial neural model comprises many simple analog sig- 
nal processing elements called “neurons” that are most of the time 
entirely interconnected by unidirectional communication channels 
called “synapses”. Any artiﬁcial neuron can receive input signals, 
process the received signals, and generate an output signal. Any 
artiﬁcial neuron is connected to at least one other neuron using a 
weight coeﬃcient, representing the degree of signiﬁcance of a par- 
ticular connection to the network [81] . More speciﬁcally, in an ar- 

tiﬁcial neuron, the produced signals from other neurons are mod- 
eled  by  input  data  of  [ X 1 ,  X 2 ,...,  X m ]  ( Fig.  6 ).  The  input  data  are 
transferred to the artiﬁcial neuron while multiplying by their as- 
sociated synaptic weights ( W 
kj ). It is noteworthy that the synap- 
tic weights might be negative, indicating their inhibitory impact. 
In addition to input data, a bias input ( b 
k ) is considered an ad- 
ditional input signal to the artiﬁcial neuron. The intensity of the 
incoming signals received by the dendrites of the artiﬁcial neuron 
is obtained by the summation of the weighted input data and the 
bias input as follows [67] :

In continuation, an activation function is applied to model the

k = ϕ ( λ

The activation function cuts the amplitude of incoming signals 
into a limited value. The most popular activation functions in arti- 
ﬁcial neural systems are unity step, identity, piecewise linear, sig- 
moid, tangent, hyperbolic tangent, and Gaussian [85] . 

ANN  models  are  categorized  either  based  on  their  learning 
mode  into  supervised/unsupervised  or  based  on  their  structures 
into feedforward or feedback recall systems [80] . A general taxon- 
omy of ANN models is presented in Fig. 7 . The learning process 
in the supervised mode is carried out using a set of data patterns, 
each of which has a distinct input and output. However, a set of 
data patterns having only input values is used in the training pro- 
cess of unsupervised ANN models. The neural networks with unidi- 
rectional information processing procedures are called feedforward 
ANN models, where information is permitted to transfer only from 
inputs to outputs. On the contrary, the neural networks with the 
bidirectional ﬂow are designated as feedback networks where any 
neuron can attain insights from the former layers while allowing 
feedback to the following layers [80] .

Fig. 7.  A general taxonomy of ANN models. Among the neural models presented above, the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), extreme learning machine 
(ELM), and self-organizing map (SOM) approaches have been used so far in biodiesel research. 

ANN models obtain their knowledge using various training or 
optimization algorithms in which numerical weights transferred by 
synapses are adjusted to minimize the error between real and sim- 
ulated data. In general, developing ANN models is not straightfor- 
ward due to many critical steps like data compilation, data pro- 
cessing, topology selection, training and testing the selected model, 
and applying the developed ANN models for simulation and valida- 
tion. Fig. 8 portrays the typical main steps involved in the develop- 
ment of ANN models. Among the mentioned steps, data prepara- 
tion is one of the most essential and crucial stages in ANN model- 
ing of complex systems [86] . This step dramatically affects the suc- 
cess of data mining and knowledge discovery tasks. To address this 
issue, Yu et al. [87] elaborated a comprehensive data preparation 
framework to analyze ANN data systematically ( Fig. 9 ). The pro- 
posed scheme can improve the training process and simplify the 
structure of ANN models [87] . Once the model development is ﬁn- 

ished, the accuracy and reliability of the model need to be veriﬁed 
and proved using various statistical criteria tabulated in Table 2 . 

3. Applications of machine learning technology in biodiesel 
production 

As  described  by  the  ASTM,  biodiesel  is  a  blend  of  fatty  acid 
alkyl esters synthesized from renewable resources like origin veg- 
etable  oils,  waste  animal  fats,  and  waste  oils  [102] .  A  typical 
biodiesel production process involves several steps: oil extraction, 
feedstock pretreatment, (trans)esteriﬁcation reaction, product sep- 
aration,  biodiesel  washing,  unreacted  alcohol  recovery,  glycerin 
neutralization, and biodiesel puriﬁcation, as shown in Fig. 10 . In 
this review, various applications of ML technology in the critical 
steps of biodiesel production are reviewed and analyzed.

ﬂuence their progress. Accordingly, there has been a growing inter- 
est in modeling and optimizing the feedstock pretreatment process 
using ML technology. The most important ML technology applica- 
tions in modeling and optimizing the feedstocks pretreatment pro- 
cesses are tabulated in Table 3 . This table also includes the use of 
ML technology for modeling the biodiesel yield of the esteriﬁcation 
process. 

Satyanarayana and Muraleedharan [105] modeled the ﬁnal AV 
of  rubber  seed  oil  using  the  MLPNN  model  in  the  esteriﬁcation 
process.  The  MLPNN  models  developed  by  Sai  Bharadwaj  et  al. 
[90] and Adepoju et al. [108] were precise over the RSM model in 
predicting the ﬁnal acid value of rubber seed oil. Ofoefule et al. 
[94]  found  that  the  developed  MLPNN  topology  was  somewhat 
better  than  the  RSM  model  in  predicting  the  FFA  reduction  of 
African pear seed oil. Rajendra et al. [109] and Jena et al. [110] suc- 
cessfully combined the MLPNN architecture with the GA paradigm 
to model and optimize the FFA level during the esteriﬁcation pro- 
cess  of  non-edible  oils.  The  MLPNN-ACO  combination  was  satis- 
factorily used by Silitonga et al. [104] to model and optimize the 
FFA reduction of Cerbera manghas oil during the esteriﬁcation pro- 
cess. Notably, the GA approach is a stochastic search method in- 
spired by the evolutionary phenomena observed in nature [114] . 
The  population-based  ACO  algorithm  takes  inspiration  from  ant 
colonies’  foraging  behavior  in  searching  the  shortest  paths  from 
their nest to the food sources [115] . 

Betiku  et  al.  [95]  applied  the  RSM,  RSM-GA,  MLPNN-GA,  and 
ANFIS-GA  approaches  to  model  and  optimize  the  FFA  reduction 
in  the  esteriﬁcation  of  palm  kernel  oil.  The  generalization  capa- 
bility  of  all  the  developed MLPNN,  ANFIS,  and  RSM  models  was 
comparable,  while  the  GA  method  provided  better  optimization 
results than the RSM model. Unlike the above-discussed studies, 
the esteriﬁcation process was used as a pretreatment method be- 
fore the transesteriﬁcation process; Fauzi and Amin [111] and Fauzi 
et al. [112] produced methyl oleate from oleic acid using the ionic 
liquid-catalyzed  esteriﬁcation  process.  In  the  former  study  [111] , 
they found that the designed MLPNN-GA model outperformed the 
RSM model in optimizing the process. In the latter work [112] , the 
developed MLPNN-GA model successfully found the optimum pro- 
cess conditions. Teo et al. [103] and Islam et al. [113] adequately 
modeled  and  optimized  the  glycerolysis  process  of  the  FFA-rich 
biodiesel  feedstocks  using  the  MLPNN-GA  model  by  minimizing 
their ﬁnal acid values. 

3.2. Biodiesel production 

Biodiesel  can  be  produced  either  through  transesteriﬁcation 
or  esteriﬁcation  reaction  [116] .  The  transesteriﬁcation  process  is 
the  most  frequently  used  way  of  synthesizing  biodiesel,  where 
methanol/ethanol is usually employed to alkylate TGs in the pres- 
ence of a catalyst to form fatty acid esters (main product) and glyc- 
erol (by-product) [117] . In short, glycerol of TGs is substituted with 
primary alcohol through the transesteriﬁcation process. The pro- 
cess comprises three successive reversible reactions in which TGs 
are  converted  to  diglycerides  (DGs),  monoglycerides  (MGs),  and

3.1. Feedstock pretreatment 

The majority of feedstocks, like non-edible and waste-derived 
oils used for biodiesel production, contain high FFAs [103] . These 
feedstock kinds are unsuitable for the base-catalyzed transesteri- 
ﬁcation process (the main biodiesel production route) due to the 
soap  formation  and  subsequent  diﬃculties  in  the  product  sepa- 
ration and puriﬁcation. This issue can be addressed using bifunc- 
tional solid catalysts, acid esteriﬁcation pretreatment process, and 
glycerolysis process [103] . Although bifunctional solid catalysts can 
simultaneously catalyze both esteriﬁcation and transesteriﬁcation 
reactions,  they  suffer  from  high  reaction  temperature  and  slow 
reaction  rate  [103] .  Accordingly,  the  acid  esteriﬁcation  pretreat- 
ment process has been widely used for reducing the FFA content 
of biodiesel feedstocks [ 90 , 104 , 105 ]. This method can also be re- 
garded as a biodiesel production method from FFA. A few reports 
can be found in the published literature on the glycerolysis process 
for treating FFA-rich biodiesel feedstocks [ 103 , 106 , 107 ]. Modeling 
and optimizing both acid esteriﬁcation pretreatment and glycerol- 
ysis processes are challenging tasks due to several factors that in-

Once  the  reaction  is  completed,  three  ester  molecules  are  made 
from  one  TG  molecule  [118] .  Through  the  esteriﬁcation  reaction, 
FFAs react with alcohol to produce an ester and a water molecule.

some of the published papers belong to more than one category.

Accordingly,  such  reports  were  placed  in  their  nearest  represen- 
tative category since it is irrational to classify particular research 
into an individual class. Overall, the main goal of the classiﬁcation 
made throughout this review is to portray a general picture of ML 
applications in biodiesel production. 

The 

fundamental  principles  and  mechanisms  behind 
mechanically-assisted,  supercritical  alcohol,  ultrasound-assisted, 
microwave-assisted,  and  enzyme-catalyzed  transesteriﬁcation 
processes are brieﬂy explained in the related subsections for the 
clarity and ease of comprehension of ML modeling systems. The 
detailed  description  can  be  found  in  the  review  papers  summa- 
rized in Table 4 , covering topics not discussed herein due to space 
limitation. 

3.2.1. Mechanically-assisted transesteriﬁcation process 

The  central  unit  of  biodiesel  production  plants  is  (trans) 
esteriﬁcation reactor, as its performance can markedly affect the 
economic-viability and environmental-sustainability of the whole 
plant. The main problem associated with the (trans)esteriﬁcation 
reaction  is  the  immiscibility  of  the  reactants  (oil  and  alcohol), 
hence lowering the mass transfer coeﬃcients and, accordingly, the 
process yield [142] . This issue can be eﬃciently solved by agitat- 
ing  the  reactants,  increasing the  working  temperature  up  to  be- 
low alcohol boiling temperature, and prolonging the reaction time 
[142] .  In  this  context,  mechanical  stirring  reactors  are  the  most 
common systems used in the (trans)esteriﬁcation process. In these 
systems, TGs or FFAs are reacted with alcohol in the presence of 
a catalyst within a batch reactor. Firstly, the reactants are heated 
up  to  the  desired  temperature,  followed  by  their  blending  us- 
ing  a  mechanical  stirring  tool.  The  most  inﬂuential  variables  on 
biodiesel yield in mechanical stirring reactors are reaction temper- 
ature, residual time, mixing intensity, type and quantity of catalyst, 
alcohol/oil ratio, reactor geometry, and so on. Both homogeneous 
and heterogeneous catalysts can be used in these reactors [143] . 
Homogeneous  catalysts,  as  the  most  widely  used  promoters  in 
the (trans)esteriﬁcation process, can be either base catalysts (e.g., 
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide) or acid catalysts (e.g., sul- 
furic, sulfonic, phosphoric, hydrochloric acids). In general, base cat- 
alysts outperform acid catalysts in the biodiesel production process 
due to their higher catalytic activity, relatively lower cost, milder 
reaction conditions, requiring low alcohol/oil molar ratio, and short 
reaction time [144] . The main drawback of base catalysts is their 
reaction with FFAs available in the feedstocks, leading to soap for- 
mation  through  saponiﬁcation.  This  can  lower  the  process  yield 
and lead to diﬃculties in downstream separation and puriﬁcation 
processes [102] . The main advantage of homogeneous acid catalytic 
over homogeneous base counterparts is their lower sensitivity to 
FFAs present in the feedstock [8] . 

The  biodiesel  production  process  under  mechanical  agitation 
can be modeled using the phenomenological simulation. However, 
this  approach  requires  the  numerical  solution  of  the  governing 
equations for the mixture of reactants and needs well understood 
and validated models of the reactants. The latter introduces a level 
of uncertainty in the results obtained from the phenomenological 
simulation that weighs far more than its required computational 
time and effort. This is why there is so much research devoted to 
applying ML-based models for modeling the mechanically-assisted 
(trans)esteriﬁcation process. The most relevant applications of ML 
techniques for modeling the mechanically-assisted transesteriﬁca- 
tion process are tabulated in Table 5 . 

Several researchers used the MLPNN approach with one hidden 
layer to model the FAME yield during transesteriﬁcation of various 
feedstocks  in  the  presence  of  base/acid  catalysts  under  mechan- 
ical  agitation  [145–149] .  The  developed  MLPNN  models  in  these 
investigations accurately predicted the FAME content. Several au- 
thors tried to compare the capability of the MLPNN approach with 

the  RSM  method  in  modeling  the  mechanically-stirred  methyla- 
tion process of various edible/non-edible oils catalyzed by differ- 
ent base/acid catalysts [ 88 , 94 , 108 , 150–153 , 155–161 , 164–168 ]. They 
all  concluded  that  the  designed  MLPNN  models  with  one  hid- 
den layer could effectively model the FAME yield compared to the 
RSM  models.  Besides,  Stamenkovi ´c  et  al.  [162]  and  Samuel  and 
Okwu  [163]  compared  the  predictive  ability  of  the  MLPNN  ap- 
proach with the RSM method in estimating the ester content of the 
mechanically-assisted transesteriﬁcation process in the presence of 
base  catalysts.  The  developed  MLPNN  with  one  hidden  layer  in 
both  studies  outperformed  the  constructed  RSM  models  in  esti- 
mating the FAEE yield. Unlike the claim of the above-listed authors, 
the prediction capability of the RSM method was close or even bet- 
ter than the MLPNN approach in some investigations. For example, 
Adepoju et al. [154] and Kowthaman and Varadappan [169] found 
that the reliability of the developed RSM and MLPNN models in 
estimating the process yield of the mechanically-agitated methy- 
lation of the esteriﬁed Thevetia peruviana seed and Schizochytrium 
algae oils in the presence of calcinated brette pearl spar mable and 
sodium-doped nanohydroxyapatite, respectively, was close to each 
other. 

In another study, Ayoola et al. [ 144 , 170 ] reported that the de- 
signed MLPNN model outperformed the RSM model in predicting 
the FAME yield of the NaOH-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation process 
of  the  pre-treated  waste  groundnut  and  palm  kernel  oils  under 
mechanical agitation. However, both of the developed models led 
to the same results for the KOH-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation pro- 
cess. Talebian-Kiakalaieh et al. [172] found that the developed RSM 
model was somewhat accurate than the trained MLPNN model in 
predicting  the  process  yield  of  the  mechanically-assisted  methy- 
lation  process  of  WCO  catalyzed  by  heteropoly  acid.  However, 
under  optimum  operating  conditions,  the  MLPNN  model  slightly 
outperformed the RSM model. Kavitha and Murugavelh [171] re- 
ported that the quadratic RSM model was much more precise than 
the  trained  MLPNN  model  in  predicting  the  FAME  yield  of  the 
degummed Sterculia foetida oil methylation process in the presence 
of KOH catalyst under mechanical agitation. 

Etim et al. [173] , Selvan et al. [174] , and Dharma et al. [175] cou- 
pled the MLPNN approach with the GA paradigm to optimize the 
transesteriﬁcation  process  of  several  non-edible  oils  under  me- 
chanical  agitation.  Similarly,  Hariram  et  al.  [176]  combined  the 
BRNN model with the GA approach to optimize the reaction condi- 
tions of the esteriﬁed Calophyllum inophyllum oil. It was found that 
the developed MLPNN-GA and BRNN-GA models could successfully 
model and adequately estimate the optimum reaction conditions. 
Similarly, Ong et al. [177] and Silitonga et al. [104] attempted to 
integrate  the  MLPNN  modeling  system  with  the  ACO  algorithm 
to model the biodiesel yield of two esteriﬁed non-edible oils and 
optimize  the  mechanically-intensiﬁed  transesteriﬁcation  reaction 
conditions. According to the outcomes of these studies, the devel- 
oped MLPNN-ACO approaches could satisfactorily model and op- 
timize  the  process  variables.  Besides,  Mazaheri  et  al.  [178]  used 
the MLPNN-ACO integration to model the KV of biodiesel and op- 
timize the reaction parameters under a ﬁxed agitation speed. The 
developed  MLPNN-ACO  model  could  adequately  track  and  opti- 
mize  the  KV  of  the  resultant  biodiesel.  In  another  study,  Nasef 
et  al.  [179]  combined  the  MLPNN  approach  with  the  SA  algo- 
rithm to model the process yield and optimize the reaction con- 
ditions  of  triacetin  transesteriﬁcation  under  mechanical  stirring. 
The developed MLPNN-SA approach could successfully predict and 
optimize  the  transesteriﬁcation  process  variables.  The  stochastic 
neighborhood-based SA algorithm takes inspiration from the cool- 
ing process of molten metals during annealing aimed at ﬁnding the 
global optimum of a given function [207] . 

Saeidi et al. [180] modeled and optimized the FAME yield and 
conversion  eﬃciency  of  the  transesteriﬁcation  process  of  palm-

slightly better than the

quadratic RSM model. 
The prediction accuracy 
of the RSM and MLPNN 
approaches in estimating 
the process yield was 
close to each other. 
The estimation ﬁdelity of 
the MLPNN model was 
higher than that of the 
RSM model for the 
NaOH-catalyzed 
transesteriﬁcation 
process. The estimation 
accuracy of both models 
was close to each other 
for the KOH-catalyzed 
transesteriﬁcation 
process. 
The developed RSM 
model was accurate than 
the MLPNN models in 
predicting the biodiesel 
yield, practically for the 
KOH-catalyzed 
transesteriﬁcation 
process. 
The RSM was much more 
accurate than the 
developed MLPNN model. 

The RSM model was 
somewhat accurate in 
comparison with the 
MLPNN model in 
estimating the FAME 
production rate. However, 
the designed MLPNN 
model slightly 
outperformed the RSM 
model at optimum 
operating conditions. 
The MLPNN-GA model 
was promising in 
modeling and optimizing 
the biodiesel production 
process.

The developed KELM 
model markedly 
outperformed the MLPNN 
model in simulating the 
process yield. The 
optimum reaction 
variables were 
satisfactorily found using 
the ACO paradigm. 

The MLPNN-GA model 
accurately predicted and 
optimized the process 
yield over the RSM 
model. 

The MLPNN-GA model 
showed better modeling 
and optimization 
capability over the RSM 
model in modeling the 
biodiesel content. 

The FFA level was 
appropriately modeled 
using the MLPNN model, 
and the optimum 
reaction conditions were 
satisfactorily found using 
the GA approach. 
The MLPNN-GA approach 
was more accurate than 
the RSM model in 
modeling the FAEE 
content, but both 
methods led to the same 
optimum reaction 
conditions. 
The RSM model 
outperformed the 
developed MLPNN-GA 
approach in modeling 
and predicting the 
process yield. 
The trained ANFIS model 
could precisely estimate 
the process yield. 

The developed ANFIS 
model successfully 
generalized the process 
yield.

and effectively optimize the transesteriﬁcation reaction variables. 
ELM is a single-hidden layer feedforward neural model whose in- 
put  weights  and  hidden  layer  biases  are  generated  randomly  at 
random [209] . In the KELM approach, the optimal number of hid- 
den  neurons  of  neural  model  is  determined  by  a  kernel  matrix 
[182] . 

Betiku et al. [183] and Dhingra et al. [184] compared the capa- 
bility of the MLPNN-GA approach with the RSM method in predict- 
ing and optimizing the biodiesel conversion rate of two non-edible 
oils under mechanical agitation. The designed MLPNN-GA models 
with one hidden layer outperformed the RSM model in general- 
izing and optimizing the process yield. Sivamani et al. [185] tried 
to model and optimize the FFA level of Simarouba glauca seed oil 
during the agitation-assisted transesteriﬁcation process using the 
RSM and MLPNN-GA approaches. The selected MLPNN-GA model 
with  one  hidden  layer  could  lead  to  better  modeling  and  opti- 
mization  results  than  the  RSM  model.  The  ethylation  process  of 
sunﬂower oil under mechanical agitation was modeled and opti- 
mized using the RSM and MLPNN-GA approaches [186] . Although 
the developed MLPNN model with one hidden layer provided bet- 
ter modeling results over the RSM model, the same optimum re- 
action conditions were obtained using both methods. Unlike the 
above-discussed studies, Stamenkovi ´c et al. [187] claimed that the 
developed RSM model was accurate and effective over the selected 
MLPNN-GA model in modeling and predicting the biodiesel yield of 
Hemp seed oil in the mechanically-assisted methylation process. 

Kumar et al. [188] successfully modeled the methylation pro- 
cess of algae-Jatropha oils mixture under mechanical agitation us- 
ing the ANFIS model developed based on four input variables. Soh- 
pal et al. [ 189 , 190 ] and Sohpal and Singh [191] found that the de- 
veloped ANFIS models could accurately predict the biodiesel yield 
of Jatropha oil during the mechanically-assisted butylation process. 
Ighose et al. [192] successfully combined the ANFIS approach and 

the GA paradigm to model and optimize the methylation process 
of the  esteriﬁed yellow  oleander seed oil under  mechanical agi- 
tation. Ishola et al. [91] coupled the RSM, MLPNN, and ANFIS ap- 
proaches  with  the  GA  paradigm  to  model  the  process  yield  and 
optimize the reaction conditions of the esteriﬁed Hibiscus sabdar- 
iffa oil under mechanical agitation. The most promising modeling 
and optimization results were obtained using the ANFIS-GA com- 
bination. In a similar study, Betiku and Ishola [193] compared the 
predictive accuracy of the MLPNN and ANFIS methods for general- 
izing the biodiesel yield of the esteriﬁed sorrel oil in the presence 
of a heterogeneous base catalyst, i.e., calcined kola nut husk pod 
ash. The ANFIS model as the selected model was then successfully 
coupled with the GA method to ﬁnd the optimum operating con- 
ditions. 

Kumar  et  al.  [196]  and  Sajjadi  et  al.  [197]  compared  the  ca- 
pacity of the RSM and ANFIS models in estimating the biodiesel 
yield during the base-catalyzed methylation process of non-edible 
feedstocks under mechanical agitation. The developed ANFIS mod- 
els slightly outperformed the RSM models. Yue et al. [194] opti- 
mized  the  structure  of  the  ANFIS  approach  using  the  PSO  algo- 
rithm  to  enhance  its  capability  for  predicting  the  process  yield 
of  the  acid-catalyzed  transesteriﬁcation  process  of  castor  oil  un- 
der mechanical agitation. The PSO-ANFIS model could satisfactorily 
model the FAME yield. Sajjadi et al. [195] used the PSO, GA, and 
DE evolutionary paradigms to optimize the topology of the ANFIS 
approach, as illustrated in Fig. 13 . They found that the DE-ANFIS 
was the best combination for modeling the biodiesel yield during 
the methylation process of palm oil under various agitation speeds. 
The population-based PSO method takes inspiration from the social 
behavior of bird ﬂocking or ﬁsh schooling [210] . The population- 
based direct-search DE algorithm is a derivative-free function opti- 
mizer based on natural selection and genetic science mechanisms. 
A  comparative  study  conducted  by  Mohadesi  and  Rezaei 
[36] showed that both developed MLPNN and ANFIS models could 
accurately model the biodiesel conversion rate during transester- 
iﬁcation of soybean oil and WCO in the presence of two waste-

derived catalysts under mechanical stirring. The authors selected 
the trained MLPNN model with one hidden layer due to its sim- 
pler structure than the developed ANFIS model. In a similar study, 
Betiku et al. [198] compared the prediction accuracy of the RSM, 
MLPNN,  and  ANFIS  approaches  in  modeling  the  mechanically- 
assisted methylation process of the esteriﬁed palm kernel oil. Even 
though  both  the  trained  MLPNN  and  ANFIS  models  were  more 
accurate than the RSM model, their generalization capability was 
close to each other. Hariram et al. [199] compared the accuracy of 
the MLPNN, RSM, and ANFIS approaches in modeling the biodiesel 
yield during the KOH-catalyzed methylation process of the ester- 
iﬁed  Vitis  vinifera  oil  under  mechanical  agitation.  All  the  devel- 
oped models could predict the process yield with an accuracy close 
to each other. The base-catalyzed methylation and ethylation pro- 
cesses  of  WCO  under  different  mixing  intensities  were  modeled 
using the RSM, MLPNN, RBFNN, and ANFIS approaches [200] . The 
RBFNN model was better than the developed MLPNN and ANFIS 
models in predicting the FAME/FAEE yield. 

Deng  et  al.  [201]  compared  the  capability  of  the  ANFIS 
and  LSSVM  approaches  tuned  respectively  by  the  PSO  and  GA 
paradigms in modeling the FAME yield during acid-catalyzed trans- 
esteriﬁcation of castor oil under mechanical agitation. The devel- 
oped GA-LSSVM model outperformed the constructed PSO-ANFIS 
model in estimating the biodiesel yield. The prediction power of 
the ELM approach was compared with the SVM modeling system 
in estimating the FAME/FAEE yield of NaOH-catalyzed transesteriﬁ- 

cation of WCO under mechanical agitation [202] . The process yield 
was accurately modeled using the developed ELM when compared 
with the SVM model. Cheng et al. [203] assessed the prediction ca- 
pability of the SVM and fmGA-SVM approaches in estimating the 
biodiesel  yield  of  the  two-step  in-situ  rice  bran  oil  methylation 
process under mechanical agitation ( Fig. 14 ). The KCGA paradigm 
successfully  optimized  the  process  variables  using  the  objective 
function developed by the fmGA-SVM approach. The SVM approach 
is a supervised ML paradigm based on statistical learning theory 
and the principle of structural risk minimization used for pattern 
recognition and regression estimation tasks [211] . The LSSVM ap- 
proach is an improved form of the classical SVM model where the 
traditional quadratic programming method is substituted with the 
linear least-squares criteria to improve operation speed and con- 
vergence accuracy [ 212 , 213 ]. The fmGA paradigm uses the variable- 
length strings created by messy chromosomes to represent possi- 
ble solutions, while the classical GA approach applies ﬁxed-length 
strings [214] . The hybrid KCGA paradigm consolidates k-means and 
chaos characteristics with the GA approach to improve the solution 
convergence and keep the population diversity [203] . 

Corral  Bobadilla  et  al.  [204]  applied  the  SVM-GA  approach 
for  modeling  and  optimizing  the  biodiesel  yield  during  the 
mechanically-assisted  methylation  of  WCO  in  the  presence  of 
NaOH catalyst. The process yield was successfully modeled and op- 
timized using the SVM-GA combination. Zhang and Niu [205] as- 
sessed  the  accuracy  of  the  LSSVM  and  ANFIS  approaches  opti-

mized  respectively  by  the  PSO  and  GA  paradigms  in  modeling 
the  biodiesel  yield  during  the  acid-catalyzed  methylation  pro- 
cess  of  castor  oil  under  mechanical  stirring.  The  developed  GA- 
LSSVM  model  was  somewhat  better  than  the  constructed  PSO- 
ANFIS  model.  Galvan  et  al.  [100]  successfully  adjusted  the  reac- 
tion constants of a four-mechanism model for the mechanically- 
assisted transesteriﬁcation of soybean oil using the PSO paradigm. 
In continuation, the SOM model developed on molar percentages 
of  the  reaction  medium  compounds  at  two  NaOH  catalyst  con- 
centrations under different reaction times satisfactorily monitored 
the reaction progress. In an interesting study, Mjalli and Hussain 
[206] compared the setpoint tracking ability and system stabiliza- 
tion (reactor temperature and FAME concentration) of three control 
strategies, including minimum variance, pole-placement, and “ap- 
proximate model predictive control strategy”, developed based on 
a time-delayed MLPNN architecture ( Fig. 15 ). The MLPNN model 
was successfully trained and tested by the data generated using a 
mechanistic model. The developed MLPNN model was then used 
in the considered control schemes and their setpoint tracking abil- 
ity  and  stability  for  the  FAME  concentration  and  reaction  tem- 
perature were compared. The “approximate model predictive con- 
trol strategy” showed reasonable ﬂuctuations in tracking the set- 
points and, accordingly, outperformed the other control strategies 
( Fig. 16 ). 

3.2.2. Supercritical alcohol transesteriﬁcation process 

The  mechanical  stirring  method  is  an  energy-intensive  and 
time-consuming  operation  [ 215 , 216 ].  These  issues  have  sparked 
a  growing  interest  in  energy-eﬃcient  and  cleaner  intensiﬁcation 
techniques  for  biodiesel  synthesis  to  improve  the  process  yield, 

shorten  the  reaction  time,  reduce  the  energy  consumption  rate, 
and minimize waste and emissions generation. Several intensiﬁca- 
tion techniques such as supercritical alcohol, hydrodynamic cavita- 
tion, and microwave/infrared irradiation have been introduced and 
applied by researchers to address the problems associated with the 
mechanical stirring method. 

Supercritical biodiesel production is a promising alternative to 
the catalytic transesteriﬁcation process, particularly for the transes- 
teriﬁcation of low-quality FFA-rich feedstocks. Mechanistically, in- 
creasing the densities of alcohol and decreasing its dielectric con- 
stants under supercritical conditions make TGs and alcohol a single 
uniform phase. Accordingly, some of the problems associated with 
the  two-phase  nature  of  alcohol/oil  mixtures  can  be  eﬃciently 
solved using the supercritical method. This technique has various 
advantages over the mechanical stirring method, including no need 
to separate catalyst and soap from the evolved esters, shorter reac- 
tion time, and insensitivity to FFAs and water present in the feed- 
stocks. However, this process suffers from several drawbacks, like 
requiring  harsh  reaction  conditions  (high  pressure  and  tempera- 
ture) and the requirement for a high molar ratio of alcohol to oil 
(usually 42:1) [ 143 , 217 , 218 ]. Reaction conditions, residual time, and 
type and amount of alcohol signiﬁcantly affect the process yield in 
the supercritical biodiesel production method. Table 6 summarizes 
the most important applications of ML-based techniques for mod- 
eling biodiesel production under supercritical alcohol conditions. 

Farobie  et  al.  [219]  conﬁrmed  the  generalization  capability 
of  the  MLPNN  models  for  predicting  the  FAME/FAEE  contents 
of  canola  oil  under  supercritical  methanol/ethanol  conditions. 
Guo  and  Baghban  [224] ,  Liua  and  Baghban  [225] ,  and  Baghban 
[226] trained the PSO-ANFIS and GA-LSSVM approaches based on

Fig. 16.  The developed "approximate model predictive control strategy". This approach minimizes a cost function according to some constraints in the controller moves 
to determine the future process control input parameters. Accordingly, a sequence of future control input parameters is generated by solving the sequential quadratic 
programming optimization problem at each sample time. The system applies the ﬁrst component of the generated sequence, while the rest control signals are used to 
initialize the optimizer in the following sampling time. r ( t ) denotes the control reference. Redrawn with permission from Mjalli and Hussain [206] . Copyright © 2009

the  data  reported  by  Farobie  et  al.  [219] .  They  claimed  that  the 
developed  PSO-ANFIS  and  GA-LSSVM  were  more  accurate  than 
the  MLPNN  model  reported  by  Farobie  et  al.  [219] .  Farobie  and 
Hasanah  [220]  precisely  predicted  the  canola  oil-based  biodiesel 
yield under supercritical methyl tert-butyl ether conditions using 
the designed MLPNN model. Furthermore, two MLPNN networks, 
designed for modeling the FAME contents of Mahua and microal- 
gae oils, outperformed the developed RSM models [ 221 , 222 ]. The 
developed ANN-GA model by Selvan et al. [223] was able to pre- 
dict the biodiesel content synthesized from Aegle marmelos oil and 
optimize the reaction conditions. 

3.2.3. Ultrasound-assisted transesteriﬁcation process 

Cavitation technology is another potential method for biodiesel 
production  because  of  its  energy-eﬃcient  character.  Particle  in- 
duced,  optical,  acoustic,  and  hydrodynamic  are  four  general  cat- 
egories  of  cavitation  technology.  Out  of  the  various  cavitation 

methods  introduced  so  far,  only  ultrasonic  and  hydrodynamic 
cavitation  methods  have  been  used  in  the  biodiesel  industry. 
Ultrasound  can  be  classiﬁed  into  two  general  categories,  i.e., 
high-frequency, low-power (1,0 0 0–10,0 0 0 kHz) and low-frequency, 
high-power (20–100 kHz) sound. High-frequency, lower-power ul- 
trasonic systems are extensively applied in various ﬁelds such as 
medicine  (scanning)  and  analytical  chemistry,  while  their  low- 
frequency, high-power counterparts are widely used in various op- 
erations  like  chemical  reactions,  polymer  welding,  and  cleaning 
purposes [130] . 

Through  the  (trans)esteriﬁcation  process,  the  introduction  of 
ultrasonic  irradiation  leads  to  cavitation  of  bubbles  close  to  the 
alcohol-oil phase boundary [227] . The consequent cyclic formation, 
growth, and asymmetric breakdown of the generated bubbles in- 
crease the temperature (higher than 50 0 0 K) and pressure (higher 
than 10 0 0 atm) of the reaction medium locally [ 228 , 229 ]. Besides, 
the alcohol-oil phase boundary is disrupted due to the generation 

32

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100904 

of micro-turbulence, leading to severe mixing between the immis- 
cible reactants [228] . Accordingly, there is no need to agitate/heat 
the reaction medium since the cavitation increases its temperature 
locally, and the micro-jets formation induces emulsiﬁcation [227] . 
Further to the above-discussed physical effects of ultrasonication, 
transient  collapse  of  the  cavitation  bubbles  leads  to  the  genera- 
•
tion of various radicals like H 
, which intensiﬁes 
(trans)esteriﬁcation reaction in the bulk medium [230] .

The  overall  energy  consumption  of  this  method  is  remark- 
ably  lower,  while  its  reaction  rate  is  signiﬁcantly  higher  than 
that  of  the  conventional  mechanical  stirring  method  [231–234] . 
The main parameters inﬂuencing the performance of ultrasound- 
assisted  (trans)esteriﬁcation  systems  are  irradiation  frequency, 
sound  power,  type  and  quantity  of  alcohol,  type  and  amount  of 
catalyst, reactor geometry, and so forth. The most important ML 
technology  applications  for  modeling  biodiesel  production  under 
ultrasonic irradiation are listed in Table 7 . 

Tan  et  al.  [228]  found  that  the  MLPNN  architecture  could  be 
successfully used to estimate the FAME purity and biodiesel yield 
during  transesteriﬁcation  of  the  esteriﬁed  Jatropha  oil  under  ul- 
trasonic  irradiation.  Maran  and  Priya  [4]  and  Maran  and  Priya 
[235] claimed that the MLPNN models trained well were more ac- 
curate than the RSM models in estimating the FAME yield of the 
ultrasound-assisted transesteriﬁcation of the esteriﬁed non-edible 
oils. Similarly, Sarve et al. [230] and Rajkovic et al. [236] reported 
that the developed MLPNN models outperformed the RSM mod- 
els in prognosticating the process yield of the ultrasound-assisted 
transesteriﬁcation  reaction  of  edible  oils.  Karimi  [237]  compared 
the RSM and MLPNN models in terms of their capability to model 
the FAME content and exergy eﬃciency of the ultrasound-assisted 
transesteriﬁcation  of  microalgae  oil.  The  performance  of  the  se- 
lected  MLPNN  model  was  better  than  the  RSM  model.  Unlike 
the  studies  discussed  above,  Badday  et  al.  [238]  found  that  the 
reliability  of  the  MLPNN  and  RSM  models  was  close  to  each 
other  in  predicting  the  biodiesel  yield  of  Jatropha  oil  under  ul- 
trasonic  irradiation  in  the  presence  of  various  heteropolyacid- 
based  catalysts.  Shenbaga  Vinayaga  Moorthi  et  al.  [239]  com- 
pared  the  estimation  capacity  of  the  MLPNN,  RBFNN,  and  RSM 
approaches  in  modeling  the  FAME  yield  during  the  ultrasound- 
assisted transesteriﬁcation of ﬁsh oil. They concluded that the de- 
signed  MLPNN  model  was  more  reliable  than  the  other  investi- 
gated  approaches,  particularly  the  RSM  model.  Thangarasu  et  al. 
[240] found that the trained MLPNN model slightly outperformed 
the RSM model in predicting the biodiesel yield during transester- 
iﬁcation of the esteriﬁed Aegle Marmelos Correa seed oil through 
an innovative ultrasonic-assisted microreactor schematically shown 
in Fig. 17 . 

Sajjadi et al. [ 142 , 197 ] found that the capability of the MLPNN, 
ANFIS, and RSM approaches was close to each other in estimating 
the FAME content obtained from palm oil under ultrasonic trans- 
esteriﬁcation. Using the same data, Sajjadi et al. [195] concluded 
that the PSO-ANFIS model was precise over the GA-ANFIS and DE- 
ANFIS models. Naderloo et al. [242] and Mostafaei et al. [243] tried 
to estimate the energy ratio, productivity, and FAME yield in pro- 
ducing  biodiesel  from  WCO  under  ultrasonication  using  the  AN- 
FIS, LR, and RSM models. They concluded that all the parameters 
considered were accurately predicted using the constructed ANFIS 
models compared to the developed LR and RSM models. Aghbashlo 
et al. [ 215 , 244 , 245 ] found that the ANFIS approach could precisely 
predict  technical,  energetic,  exergetic,  exergoeconomic,  and  exer- 
goenvironmental  parameters  of  a  piezo-ultrasonic  reactor  (low- 
power,  high-frequency  ultrasound  module)  used  for  synthesizing 
biodiesel from WCO. The developed ANFIS models were then pre- 
sented to evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization 
of the process. Notably, a multi-objective optimization problem is 
somewhat complex than a single objective optimization process as 

33 

more than one objective function, even in conﬂict with each other, 
need to be optimized simultaneously. 

Mujtaba  et  al.  [241]  found  that  the  accuracy  of  the  ELM 
and  RSM  approaches  in  estimating  the  biodiesel  yield  during 
ultrasound-assisted transesteriﬁcation of palm-sesame oil mixture 
was  comparable.  The  CS  method  was  also  much  more  effec- 
tive than the RSM approach in optimizing the process variables. 
Moayedi et al. [96] presented a comprehensive neural model by 
considering various parameters signiﬁcantly affecting the biodiesel 
yield during the ultrasound-assisted transesteriﬁcation process, as 
shown in Fig. 18 . They found that the AMT model was more pre- 
cise than the RT, LMS, and MLPNN approaches in estimating the 
biodiesel  yield.  The  newly-proposed  AMT  algorithm  is  based  on 
the ensemble learning method. The structure of this approach is 
formed by  a single tree  [96] .  In the  RT  approach, the  stochastic 
process is used to create a tree [246] . The LMS approach is a non- 
linear semi-parametric quantile regression [96] . 

3.2.4. Microwave-assisted transesteriﬁcation process 

The heating of the reactants during the (trans)esteriﬁcation pro- 
cess  is  often  carried  out  using  the  conventional  heating  process 
based on conduction and convection heat transfer modes [89] . This 
ineﬃcient heating process suffers from several drawbacks, such as 
its dependency on the density, speciﬁc heat capacity, and thermal 
conductivity of reactants [89] . Biodiesel production under the con- 
ventional  heating  mode  is  a  time-consuming  and  heterogeneous 
process [89] . The problems associated with the conventional heat- 
ing  process  can  be  signiﬁcantly  resolved  using  microwave  irra- 
diation  [247] .  The  wavelength  and  frequency  of  microwaves  are 
respectively  in  the  range  of  0.01–1  m  and  0.3–300  GHz.  Polar 
molecules can absorb the irradiated microwave energy and then 
release the absorbed energy in the form of thermal energy. Unlike 
polar molecules, non-polar counterparts are inert to microwave ra- 
diation. Besides, microwaves can inﬂuence molecular motions such 
as the ion migration/dipole rotations without affecting the molec- 
ular structure [248] . Since the mixture of TGs/FFAs, alcohol, and 
base/acid catalysts contains both polar and ionic compounds, ef- 
ﬁcient  and  rapid  heating  can  be  achieved  from  microwave  irra- 
diation.  This  volumetric  and  selective  heating  method  is  a  well- 
established method of intensifying and improving chemical reac- 
tions like (trans)esteriﬁcation process due to the direct delivery of 
energy to the reactants [249] . 

Furthermore, the separation process is more straightforward in 
the microwave-assisted (trans)esteriﬁcation process than the con- 
ventional heating process [ 123 , 131 ]. The (trans)esteriﬁcation pro- 
cess under microwave irradiation depends on several parameters, 
including frequency and wavelength of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, 
feedstock  characteristics,  type  and  quantity  of  alcohol,  type  and 
amount of catalyst, reactor geometry, and so on. Table 8 tabulates 
the  most  important  applications  of  ML  techniques  for  modeling 
and control of biodiesel production under microwave irradiation. 

Ma et al. [89] attempted to model the acidiﬁed oil esteriﬁca- 
tion  process  under  microwave  irradiation  using  the  MLPNN  and 
RSM approaches. The MLPNN model slightly exhibited slightly bet- 
ter generalization capability in comparison with the RSM model. 
Selvaraj et al. [250] used the MLPNN and RSM approaches for pre- 
dicting the FAME yield of the microwave-assisted transesteriﬁca- 
tion of WCO. The developed MLPNN model was precise over the 
constructed RSM model in generalizing the process yield. Silitonga 
et al. [251] used a combination of the ELM approach and the CS al- 
gorithm to model the process yield and optimize the reaction pa- 
rameters during the transesteriﬁcation of Ceiba pentandra oil mi- 
crowave irradiation. The reported results conﬁrmed the capability 
of the developed approach for modeling and optimizing the trans- 
esteriﬁcation process. The metaheuristics-based CS algorithm takes 
inspiration from the obligate brood parasitic behavior of cuckoo,

was better than the

The FAME prediction 
potential of the MLPNN 
model was trivially better 
than the RSM model. 

The FAME prediction and

MLPNN-GA model were 
comparable to the RSM 
model. 

The biodiesel yield was 
accurately predicted 
using the developed 
approaches, and the 
optimum operating

successfully found using 
the CS method. 

The FAME prediction 
power of both ANFIS and 
RSM models was close to 
each other. 

The process yield was 
appropriately predicted 
using the PSO-ANFIS

More precise FAME

using the ANFIS in

together with the Lévy ﬂight behavior of some birds and fruit ﬂies 
[253] . 

In  a  pioneering  example  of  the  use  of  ML  technology  in 
biodiesel production, Wali et al. [249] compared the capability of 
the classical fuzzy logic, ANFIS, and adaptive controllers to monitor 
and control a pilot-scale microwave reactor applied for producing 
biodiesel from WCO in real-time. The closed-loop block diagram of 
the developed biodiesel production reactor with the controller is 
depicted in Fig. 19 . The controller was applied to monitor and con- 
trol the transesteriﬁcation reaction temperature by controlling mi- 
crowave power. They deduced that the developed ANFIS controller 
was more robust to parameter changes than the conventional fuzzy 
and  adaptive  controllers.  Fig.  20  illustrates  the  developed  ANFIS 
controller block diagram in which the iterative learning control ap- 
proach was applied to enhance the tracking capability of the in- 
verse ANFIS control. In the next work, Wali et al. [252] compared 
the  GA-ANFIS  controller  ( Fig.  21 )  with  the  conventional  error- 
based adaptive controller for real-time control of the microwave- 
assisted transesteriﬁcation process. The ﬂowchart of the GA-ANFIS 
model developed by Wali et al. [252] for optimizing the microwave 
power  supply  is  shown  in  Fig.  22 .  The  developed  GA-ANFIS 
controller  showed  a  fast  self-updating  capability  based  on  real- 
time  error  information  compared  with  the  error-based  adaptive 
controller. 

3.2.5. Enzyme-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation process 

The enzyme-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation process offers several 
beneﬁts  over  chemical-catalyzed  counterparts.  Low-quality  feed- 
stocks  like non-edible oils having high amounts of FFA and wa- 

ter  can  be  eﬃciently  converted  into  biodiesel  in  the  presence 
of heterogeneous enzymatic catalysts. Enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel 
production  does  not  require  feedstock  pretreatment  and  catalyst 
removal.  This  process  has  lower  energy  consumption  than  the 
chemical-catalyzed  transesteriﬁcation  process  since  the  reaction 
can be performed under mild temperature and pressure conditions. 
The enzyme, mainly lipases and obtained from biological systems 
like microorganisms, plants, and animals, can be used in immo- 
bilized or soluble form. The high enzyme cost and long reaction 
time are the main drawbacks of this process, making it econom- 
ically unviable and hindering its real-world application so far [8] . 
Table 9 tabulates the most important applications of ML technol- 
ogy for modeling enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel production. 

Ying et al. [254] considered the MLPNN modeling system for 
predicting the FAME yield during the esteriﬁcation of the saponi- 
ﬁed and acid-treated rapeseed soapstock in the presence of Can- 
dida rugosa lipase. The developed MLPNN model was able to es- 
timate the biodiesel yield with acceptable accuracy. Karimi et al. 
[255]  applied  the  MLPNN  and  RSM  models  for  estimating  the 
process yield and exergetic eﬃciency during biodiesel production 
from WCO  in  the  presence  of  lipase  immobilized  onto  magnetic 
nanoparticles.  The  capacity  of  the  developed  MLPNN  model  for 
predicting the output variables was better than the RSM model. 
Zarei et al. [256] exhibited that the developed RSM model was triv- 
ially accurate than the selected MLPNN model in generalizing the 
methylation process of Jatropha oil in the presence of immobilized 
lipase-catalyst beads within the reactor vessel located in an incu- 
bator shaker. Amini et al. [257] used the MLPNN and GA combi- 
nation to model and optimize the sweet basil seed oil methylation

3.3. Other applications of machine learning technology in biodiesel 
production 

Further  to  the  above-categorized  ML  technology  applications 
in  biodiesel  production,  some  other  applications  of  this  power- 
ful tool can be found in the published literature. Moosavi Zenooz 
et al. [258] used the RBFNN, MLPNN, and ensemble MLPNN ap- 
proaches for modeling Chlorella sp. microalgae ﬂocculation as po- 
tential  biodiesel  feedstock  based  on  ﬂocculant  dosage,  pH,  and 
optical  density  of  cells.  The  developed  ensemble  MLPNN  model 
precisely predicted the microalgae ﬂocculation process, while the 
RBFNN  and  MLPNN  models  failed  to  estimate  the  targets  satis- 
factorily. Li et al. [259] properly correlated the dry cell weight of 
Chlorella  sorokiniana  microalga  as  a  potential  biodiesel  feedstock 

with temperature, initial glucose dosage, initial KNO 
3 dosage, and 
cultivation time using the MLPNN approach with one hidden layer. 
In an interesting study, Co ¸s gun et al. [260] satisfactorily found the 
combination  of  variables  resulting  in  high  biomass  productivity 
and lipid content of microalgae using the decision trees (DT) ap- 
proach ( Fig. 23 ). In continuation, the association rule mining (ARM) 
method was used to manifest the ranges of variables leading to 
very high biomass productivity and lipid content levels. Notably, 
the  non-parametric  supervised  learning-based  DT  approach  esti- 
mates  the  desired  variable  by  learning  simple  decision  rules  in- 
ferred from the data features [261] . The ARM learning approach 
is a data mining task aimed at identifying prominent relationships 
between variables in large databases [262] . 

Sambasivam and Murugavelh [263] used the MLPNN and RSM 
approaches for modeling oil extraction from Sterculia foetida seeds 
as a function of sample weight, solvent/seed volumetric ratio, and 
extraction time. The obtained oil was then degummed and con- 
verted into biodiesel in the presence of an alkali catalyst. The de- 
veloped RSM model was precise over the MLPNN model accord-

used to explore the critical factors affecting algal biomass and lipid production. The DT approach could discover 11 and 13 different combinations of variables resulting in 
high biomass productivity and lipid content, respectively. The ARM approach could help recognize the ranges of variables leading to very high biomass and lipid production.

et al. [108] and Onoji et al. [264] compared the accuracy of the 
MLPNN  and  RSM  modeling  systems  in  estimating  the  extraction 
yield of rubber seed oil as potential biodiesel feedstock as a func- 
tion of sample weight, solvent volume, and extraction time. Un- 
like  Adepoju  et  al.  [108] ,  Onoji  et  al.  [264]  concluded  that  the 
designed  MLPNN  model  was  more  reliable  than  the  RSM  model 
in  generalizing  the  extraction  yield.  In  a  similar  study,  Adepoju 
et  al.  [154]  claimed  that  the  accuracy  of  the  MLPNN  and  RSM 
models developed based on sample weight, solvent volume, and 
extraction time was close to each other in predicting the extrac- 
tion yield of Thevetia peruviana seed oil. Selvan et al. [265] evalu- 
ated the prediction accuracy of the RSM and MLPNN modeling sys- 
tems for modeling the extraction yield of Aegle mormelos seed oil 
as a function of particle size of the grounded seeds, acid dosage, 
solvent/seed ratio, extraction time, and temperature. The MLPNN 
model accurately estimated the oil yield compared with the RSM 
model. Akintunde et al. [266] aﬃrmed that the prediction accu- 
racy of the RSM and MLPNN models developed based on sample 
weight, time, and solvent type for estimating oil extraction from 
Bauhinia monandra seed as a biodiesel feedstock was close to each 
other. 

Kurtulmu ¸s and Ünal [267] used various ML classiﬁers, i.e., SVM, 
K-nearest  neighbors  (KNN),  and  stochastic  gradient  descent  ap- 
proaches to discriminate rapeseed (as a biodiesel feedstock) vari- 
eties based on image texture features. The features were selected 
using the principal component analysis (PCA), stepwise discrimi- 
nant analysis (DA), and recursive feature elimination methods and 
were presented to the investigated classiﬁers. The SVM classiﬁer 
adequately classiﬁed seven rapeseed varieties using the image tex- 
ture  features  selected  by  the  stepwise  DA  and  recursive  feature 
elimination  techniques.  The  non-parametric  KNN  approach  esti- 
mates objects’ class memberships according to the k-closest train- 
ing samples in the feature space [268] . The stochastic gradient de- 
scent approach classiﬁes the observed data based on the discrimi- 
native learning method [269] . Soltani et al. [270] used the MLPNN 
modeling  system  to  predict  the  nanocrystalline  size  of  the  sul- 
fonated mesoporous zinc oxide catalyst developed to catalyze the 
transesteriﬁcation  process  as  a  function  of  reaction  temperature, 
calcination temperature, zinc concentration, and reaction time. The 
developed  MLPNN  model  satisfactorily  estimated  the  nanocrys- 
talline size of the synthesized catalyst. The catalyst was then effec- 
tively used in the methylation process of palm fatty acid distillate. 

Chakraborty  and  Sahu  [271]  attempted  to  model  the  conver- 
sion rate of goat tallow into biodiesel during the transesteriﬁca- 
tion process under infrared radiation and mechanical agitation us- 
ing the MLPNN and RSM approaches in the presence of sulfuric 
acid. The trained MLPNN was slightly more accurate than the RSM 
model in estimating the FAME yield. Naderloo [272] compared the 
prediction  accuracy  of  the  RSM,  MLPNN,  and  ANFIS  approaches 
in estimating the energy ratio of the biodiesel production process 
in  an  automatic  controlled  hydrodynamic  cavitation  reactor.  The 
feed ﬂow rate, methanol/oil molar ratio, reactor rotational speed, 
and circulation time were the input parameters of the developed 
models. The accuracy of the RSM and ANFIS models was close to 
each other, while both of the developed models outperformed the 
MLPNN model. Fahmi and Cremaschi [273] used the ANN method 
to tackle the computational complexity of the superstructure opti- 
mization model applied to ﬁnd the optimum biodiesel production 
scenario from virgin oil by minimizing the net present sink. They 
found that the ANN approach was a promising strategy to substi- 
tute ﬁrst-principle models for the processing units and junctions. 

In an interesting research carried out by Aimerbtam and Pan- 
japornpon  [274] ,  the  mean  palm  oil  droplet  size  was  monitored 
and controlled in real-time within a micro-channel reactor applied 
for biodiesel production. The direct inverse neural network (DINN) 
controller,  coupled  with  a  high-speed  image  acquisition  system, 
was applied to manipulate and control the oil feed ﬂow rate to ob- 
tain the desired oil droplet size. An ANN estimator was also used 
for compensating for the process-model mismatch errors, as shown 
in Fig. 24 . A pump was used to change the oil feed ﬂow rate. The 
developed control algorithm embedded into a ﬁeld-programmable 
gate array real-time controller was interfaced with the high-speed 
camera  and  pump.  The  monitoring  droplet  size  within  the  mi- 
crochannel  reactor  is  schematically  shown  in  Fig.  25 .  According 
to the servo test results, as shown in Fig. 26 , the oil droplet size 
was  successfully  controlled  using  the  proposed  controller  com- 
pared with the conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller. 

In  a  pioneering  example  of  the  use  of  ML  technology  in 
biodiesel  production,  García  et  al.  [275]  developed  a  soft-sensor 
based on the random activation weight neural net model for mon- 
itoring the rate of palm oil ethylation in the presence of KOH cat- 
alyst. The MLPNN model was used to ﬁnd a correlation between 
the electrical conductivity of reaction slurry and the evolved FAEE 
concentration based on off-line laboratory experiments. The elec-

action progress and monitor the biodiesel production rate within 
the developed continuous reactor based on the obtained results. 
In  a  similar  context,  Torrisi  and  Sabino  [276]  attempted  to  esti- 
mate the yield of the transesteriﬁcation process through correlat- 
ing biodiesel content with the viscosity of reaction slurry using the 

probabilistic  neural  network  (PNN)  approach.  They  claimed  that 
using Coriolis viscosity sensors together with the well-trained PNN 
could  be  a  practical  approach  for  real-time  biodiesel  production 
veriﬁcation. The non-parametric feed-forward PNN approach is a 
type of RBFNN model with the potential application for classiﬁca- 
tion and pattern recognition problems [277] .

though biodiesel is a mixture with less complicated chemicals than 
petrodiesel [285] , various feedstock origins and processing condi- 
tions impose diﬃculties in modeling its physico-chemical proper- 
ties and controlling its fuel quality. 

Furthermore, the puriﬁed biodiesel leaving the production pro- 
cess contains various contaminants like glycerin, alcohol, catalyst, 
FFAs, MGs, DGs, and TGs [292] . These impurities signiﬁcantly affect 
biodiesel’s physico-chemical properties, resulting in several oper- 
ational and environmental problems [292] . Accordingly, standards 
limiting  the  quantity  of  these  contaminants  in  biodiesel  are  vi- 
tal  [292] .  Generally,  the  present  procedures  for  detecting  these 
contaminants are relatively costly and lengthy processes, motivat- 
ing  the  quest  for  alternative  approaches.  These  alternative  tech- 
niques are often based on mathematical and computational meth- 
ods  employed  to  spectrometric,  chromatographic,  and  electroan- 
alytical data. Table 11 tabulates the most important ML technol- 
ogy applications in modeling and estimating the physico-chemical 
properties of biodiesel. It is worth noting that the use of ML tech- 
nology in predicting physico-chemical properties of biodiesel has 
been  limited  so  far  to  density,  CN,  DV/KV,  FP,  HV,  PP,  CP,  CFPP, 
IV, and OS. Therefore, based on the published literature, this sec- 
tion is categorized into eight different subsections. Applications of 
ML  techniques  in  modeling  other  physico-chemical  properties  of 
biodiesel fuel are illustrated in Subsection 3.9 . 

4.1. Cetane number 

One of the most crucial prime quality attributes of fuels is their 
ignition and combustion behavior [341] , reﬂecting the suitability of 
fuels for use in compression ignition engines. CN has been adopted 
as a useful metric to measure the ignition and combustion quality 
of diesel fuels [341] . This dimensionless indicator determines the 
readiness of diesel fuels to auto-ignite upon introduction into the 
combustion  chamber  [313] .  Furthermore,  CN  is  nonlinearly  asso- 
ciated with ignition delay (ID), i.e., the time interval that elapses 
between fuel introduction into the cylinder and autoignition onset 
[313] . Notably, ID is affected by the engine type and its operating 
conditions  in  practice  [ 24 , 342 ].  The  ID  time  consists  of  a  physi- 
cal delay coupled with a chemical delay occurring simultaneously. 
The physical delay includes atomization, heating, vaporization, and 
mixing, while the chemical delay encompasses pre-combustion re- 
actions in the air-fuel mixture [302] . A higher CN value implies a 
shorter ID, ensuring good cold startability and stable engine op- 
eration [313] . It is well-documented that NO x and UHC emissions 
can be markedly mitigated using diesel fuels having higher CN val- 
ues [343] . In contrast, a lower CN value implies a longer ID, caus- 
ing engine knocking, elevating UHC and PM emissions due to in- 
complete combustion [38] . Besides, a prolonged ID leads to a more 
intense premixed combustion phase, which signiﬁcantly promotes 
the emission of NO x and noise due to an increase in peak pressure 
and temperature [344] . 

CN  is  usually  measured  using  standard  test  procedures  like 
ASTM D613 and EN 5165 [345] . According to the ASTM D613, this 
index is determined by matching versus the blends of two refer- 
ence fuels, i.e., hexadecane with a CN of 100 as the high-quality 
reference compound and heptamethylnonane with a CN of 15 as 
the low-quality reference compound [296] . CN of the fuel under 
investigation is the volumetric percentage of hexadecane in a mix- 
ture  of  the  reference  fuels  with  a  similar  ignition  quality  when 
combusted in a similar engine under the same operating condi- 
tions [293] . The standards ASTM D975 and EN 590 for petrodiesel 
fuel prescribe minimum CN values of 40 and 51, respectively [341] . 
However, the standards ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 for biodiesel 
require minimum CN values of 47 and 51, respectively [341] . The 
CN of biodiesel varies between 48 and 67 depending on several 
factors, including feedstock growth conditions, oil processing tech-

Reynel-Ávila  et  al.  [278]  proposed  a  new  hybrid  MLPNN- 
mathematical  local  composition  model  to  simulate  the  liquid- 
liquid phase behavior of ester/glycerol/alcohol/water mixtures in- 
volved  in  biodiesel  production  systems.  The  MLPNN  model  was 
used  to  compute  the  binary  interaction  parameters  of  the  non- 
random  two-liquid  (NRTL)  equation.  The  estimated  binary  inter- 
action  parameters  by  the  MLPNN  model  were  then  introduced 
into the NRTL equation. Overall, the developed hybrid model was 
more precise than the original version of the NRTL equation. Shah- 
baz et al. [279] satisfactorily predicted glycerol elimination from 
biodiesel by using ammonium-/phosphunium-derived deep eutec- 
tic solvents through the MLPNN model trained on eight input vari- 
ables. 

4. Applications of machine learning technology in modeling 
biodiesel properties 

Despite  the  promising  features  of  biodiesel  like  renewability, 
biodegradability, nontoxicity, safety, and benignity [280] , some of 
its unfavorable physico-chemical properties are of concern to in- 
vestigators  and  industrialists  [281] .  It  is  worth  noting  that  fatty 
acid-dependent  physico-chemical  attributes  of  biodiesel  substan- 
tially affect its processing, storage, transportation, handling, com- 
bustion, and post-combustion. Hence, biodiesel must comply with 
the established international biodiesel norms like ASTM D6751 and 
EN 14214 to certify its fuel quality before being commercialized in 
the market ( Table 10 ) [282] . However, biodiesel’s physico-chemical 
properties  using  the  experimental  procedures  clariﬁed  in  these 
standards  is  time-consuming,  operator-dependent,  cost-intensive, 
and error-prone. Besides, the use of physical simulations for char- 
acterizing biodiesel fuel is far more challenging than for model- 
ing its production process. This can be attributed to the variabil- 
ity in the ester composition of biodiesel fuel because of substan- 
tial variations in the origin feedstock. Accordingly, developing ac- 
curate  models  and  simulations  for  estimating  biodiesel  physico- 
chemical properties like density, CN, DV/KV, FP, HV, PP, CP, CFPP, 
IV, and OS from its chemical and physical features is invaluable for 
the scientiﬁc community. Chain length, unsaturation degree, chain 
branching,  double  bond  number,  and  double  bond  conﬁguration 
are the main structural features of a given fatty ester molecule af- 
fecting its physico-chemical properties [ 7 , 283 , 284 ]. Notably, even

nology, and feedstock transesteriﬁcation method [118] . The CN of 
biodiesel fuel depends on its molecular composition and structure, 
such as chain length and unsaturation degree [344] . The shorter 
the  chain  length  and  the  more  unsaturated  the  carbon  chains, 
the  lower  the  CN  is  [346] .  All  the  standard  procedures  devel- 
oped to measure the CN of diesel fuels are error-prone, operator- 
dependent,  time-consuming,  and  cost-intensive  [297] .  Therefore, 
many attempts have been made to establish theoretical and math- 
ematical models to estimate the CN of biodiesel fuels quickly and 
reliably from their chemical attributes. 

In  this  respect,  Ramadhasa  et  al.  [293]  found  a  good  agree- 
ment between the experimental CN values and those predicted us- 
ing four different ANN structures  developed based on the FAME 
proﬁle.  Piloto-Rodríguez  et  al.  [294]  concluded  that  the  selected 
MLPNN model could better estimate the CN of biodiesel over the 
MLR model as a function of the FAME proﬁle. In another study, 
Piloto-Rodríguez  et  al.  [295]  found  that  the  BPP-trained  MLPNN 
model with the CGD algorithm could acceptably estimate the CN 
of  biodiesel  from  its  FAME  content.  Cheenkachorn  [303]  stated 
that the CN of biodiesel fuel could be precisely estimated using 

the MLPNN and statistical models developed based on the FAME 
proﬁle.  Giwa  et  al.  [304]  deduced  that  the  FAME  proﬁle-based 
MLPNN model could well-estimate the CN of biodiesel. Rocabruno- 
Valdés et al. [305] satisfactory predicted the CN of biodiesel using 
the MLPNN model based on the FAME proﬁle. De Oliveira et al. 
[306] reported that the MLPNN model developed based on com- 
binations  of  CI,  FP,  distillation  curves,  and  speciﬁc  gravity  could 
satisfactorily predict the CI of diesel/biodiesel blends. Yu and Zhao 
[307] found that the coupled GA-MLPNN model trained based on 
the  FAME  proﬁle  could  adequately  estimate  the  CN  of  biodiesel. 
Sánchez-Borroto  et  al.  [302]  found  that  the  MLPNN  model  de- 
veloped  based  on  the  FAME  proﬁle  could  generalize  the  CN  of 
biodiesel with acceptable precision. Hosseinpour et al. [22] demon- 
strated that the MLPNN-PLS model (shown in Fig. 27 ) was much 
more robust than the classical PLS method in generalizing the CN 
of biodiesel. 

Miraboutalebi et al. [296] used the RF and MLPNN models for 
predicting the CN of biodiesel based on its FAME proﬁle. Although 
the trained MLPNN model could lead to better results over the de- 
veloped RF model, the RF model could provide highly transparent

The accuracy of the 
developed models, 
particularly the CFNN 
model, was remarkably 
better than the empirical 
correlations in predicting 
the KV of diesel/biodiesel 
blends. 

The MLPNN model was 
much more precise than 
the regression models in 
estimating the viscosity 
and density of fuel blends. 

The ANFIS models were 
much more precise than 
the MLPNN models, 
particularly for the KV of 
fuel blends.

Fig. 27.  The PLS model adapted by the MLPNN approach developed for modeling the CN of biodiesel. In this approach, the MLPNN model was considered as an internal 
part of the PLS approach to ﬁnd the internal relationships between its input and output score vectors. X and Y denote the matrices of input and output variables, E and 
F the input and output residuals, p and q the input and output loading vectors, and t and u the input and output score vectors, respectively. w and c show the PLS outer 
transformation matrices, ANN displays the best-performing neural model, ˆ u indicates the predicted u by the ANN model, and h represents the latent variable. The superscript 
T shows the matrix transpose. Redrawn with permission from Hosseinpour et al. [22] . Copyright © 2016 Elsevier. 

and  easily  interpretable  insights.  The  RF  approach  is  a  transpar- 
ent ML technique as it allows for a clear understanding of what 
characteristics play an important role in decision-making. In better 
words, the RF model rules can be easily extracted and simply in- 
terpreted [347] . Baghban et al. [300] found that the MLPNN model 
optimized by the TLBO approach was slightly accurate than that 
tuned by the PSO algorithm in estimating the CN of biodiesel based 
on the double bond number, carbon number, and molar mass of 
FAMEs. The population-oriented TLBO approach mimics the teach- 
ing and learning processes in a class [348] . 

Faizollahzadeh  et  al.  [299]  satisfactorily  used  the  ANFIS  ap- 
proach  for  modeling  the  CN  of  biodiesel  based  on  four  input 
variables, i.e., IV, carbon number, double bounds, and saponiﬁca- 
tion  value.  Mostafaei  [297]  found  that  the  ANFIS  model  devel- 
oped based on the grid partition algorithm was more accurate than 
those set by subtractive clustering and fuzzy c-means methods for 
estimating the CN of biodiesel as a function of its double bond and 
molar  weight.  The  PSO-ANFIS  model  developed  as  a  function  of 
three chemical properties of FAMEs by Noushabadi et al. [301] was 
slightly accurate than the MNR approach in predicting the CN of 
biodiesel. Alviso et al. [308] successfully used the GP model as a 
transparent  approach  compared  with  the  MLPNN  model  to  esti- 
mate the CN of biodiesel from its FAME composition. Notably, the 
programming procedure of GP is inspired by natural selection and 
evolution [349] . Bemani et al. [298] attempted to tune the LSSVM 
approach with the GA, PSO, and HGAPSO evolutionary algorithms 
to  model  the  CN  of  biodiesel  as  a  function  of  its  FAME  proﬁle 
( Fig. 28 ). The LSSVM model tuned by the HGAPSO algorithm was 
somewhat accurate than those adjusted by the GA and PSO meth- 
ods. The HGAPSO approach combines the GA and PSO paradigms, 
where the PSO algorithm generates new offsprings of the GA ap- 
proach [298] . 

In  an  innovative  study,  Nadai  et  al.  [285]  inferred  the  CN  of 
fatty acid esters and their mixtures using the structural informa- 
tion  derived  from  proton  NMR  ( 1 H  NMR)  spectra.  The  PCA  ap- 
proach was ﬁrst used to diagnose the redundant data and deter- 
mine the number of the cluster for fuzzy clustering classiﬁcation. 
The membership values of the fuzzy clustering process were then 
fed into the MLPNN approach to estimate the CN of fatty acid es- 
ters and their mixtures ( Fig. 29 ). According to the results obtained, 
the predicted CN values agreed well with the real data. 

4.2. Viscosity 

The  main  reason  behind  the  transesteriﬁcation  of  origin  veg- 
etable oils and waste animal fats is their high viscosity [308] . This 
physical parameter is one of the most critical ﬂuid properties of 
biodiesel since it directly affects in-cylinder fuel atomization qual- 
ity in diesel engines [350] . This highly temperature-dependent pa- 
rameter signiﬁcantly impacts air-fuel mixture quality, combustion 
behavior, performance parameters, and emission characteristics of 
the diesel engines operating on biodiesel fuel [310] . Despite that 
the biodiesel viscosity is an order of magnitude lower than that 
of its original feedstock [351] , its ﬂuidity is still lower than that of 
petrodiesel [317] . Generally, biodiesel fuel of high viscosity leads to 
the formation of larger droplets upon injection, deteriorates vapor- 
ization of the injected droplets, narrows the injection spray angle, 
and increases the longitudinal penetration of the fuel spray [24] . 

Notably,  the  high  viscosity  of  biodiesel  results  in  more  oper- 
ational  problems  in  cold  climates  due  to  a  dramatic  increase  in 
this  property  as  temperature  decreases  [38] .  In  turn,  these  foul 
fuel  injectors  promote  polymerization  reaction,  increase  exhaust 
smoke/particulate emissions, increase in-cylinder carbon deposits, 
and corrode engine metallic/non-metallic parts and accelerate oil 
dilution [276] . On the contrary, a fuel with very low viscosity can- 
not adequately lubricate moving elements of the fuel injection sys- 
tem, leading to leakage or increased wear [309] . The viscosity is of- 
ten reported in terms of DV and KV. DV is a measure of resistance 
or internal friction of a liquid to ﬂow or shear when subjected to 
deformation [24] . KV is simply the DV of a liquid divided by its 
density. 

Considering  the  crucial  importance  of  biodiesel  viscosity  for 
engine  performance  and  emission  characteristics,  all  well-known 
biodiesel  standards  often  specify  the  upper  and  lower  limits  for 
this property [284] . The biodiesel viscosity should be in the range 
of  1.9–6.0  mm 2 /s  and  3.5–5.0  mm 2 /s  according  to  the  ASTM 
D6751 and EN 14214 norms, respectively (both measured at 40 °C) 
[304] .  Various  factors,  including  fatty  acid  chain  length,  alco- 
hol  chain  length,  saturation  degree,  double-bond  conﬁguration, 
chain branching, impurities level (glycerides, glycerol, alcohol, wa- 
ter,  catalyst),  and  oxidation  products,  affect  the  biodiesel  viscos- 
ity [ 38 , 284 , 325 ]. Increasing fatty acid chain length, alcohol chain 
length,  and  saturation  degree  increase  biodiesel  viscosity  [284] .

H NMR spectra. 

The  biodiesel  viscosity  also  increases  in  the  presence  of  chain 
branching and oxidation products [38] . The viscosity of biodiesel 
with  cis  double-bond  conﬁguration  is  lower  than  that  of  having 
trans double-bond [38] . Notably, the double-bond position trivially 
affects  the  biodiesel  viscosity  [38] .  Although  viscosity  measure- 
ment  is  a  relatively  simple  endeavor,  it  is  a  labor-intensive  and 
time-consuming  process.  Accordingly,  developing  reliable  models 
and predictors for estimating viscosity of biodiesel is crucial and 
beneﬁcial for optimizing the operation conditions of diesel engines 
running on biodiesel. 

In this area, Giwa et al. [304] reported that the FAME proﬁle- 
based MLPNN model could acceptably model the KV of biodiesel. 
Cheenkachorn  [303]  claimed  that  the  accuracy  of  the  MLPNN 
model  trained  based  on  the  FAME  proﬁle  was  comparable  with 
the  developed  mathematical  equation  in  estimating  the  KV  of 
biodiesel. Meng et al. [310] claimed that the MLPNN model devel- 
oped based on experimental data outperformed the previously re- 
ported empirical equations in estimating the KV of biodiesel from 
its FAME proﬁle. Zhou [311] reported that the LSSVM model de- 
veloped  based  on  temperature,  pressure,  and  density  was  much 
more accurate than the GA-RBFNN model in simulating the KV of 
biodiesel. In a similar study, the PSO-LSSVM model elaborated by 
Razavi et al. [340] based on temperature, carbon number, and dou- 
ble bond number precisely predicted the KV of biodiesel compared 
with the ANFIS model developed by Mostafaei [339] . Agarwal et al. 
[323] and Barradas et al. [325] proved the superiority of the FAME 
proﬁle-based MLPNN approach in modeling the DV of biodiesel in 
comparison with the LR method. 

In contrast with previous studies, Bukkarapu and Krishnasamy 
[315]  could  not  precisely  predict  the  KV  of  biodiesel  using  the 
MLPNN  model  developed  based  on  the  FAME  proﬁle  of  palm 
oil  biodiesel  and  its  blends  with  various  neat  methyl  esters. 
Rocabruno-Valdés et al. [305] observed a good match between ex- 

perimental DV data and those estimated using the MLPNN mod- 
els  developed  based  on  either  temperature  and  FAME  proﬁle  or 
carbon atom number and hydrogen atom number of FAMEs. The 
MLPNN model developed by Jahirul et al. [284] based on 27 physi- 
cal and chemical input parameters could accurately predict the KV 
of biodiesel. In a similar study but with different input parameters, 
Jahirul  et  al.  [309]  successfully  predicted  the  viscosity  of  WCO- 
derived biodiesel using the developed MLPNN model. 

Eryilmaz  et  al.  [312]  successfully  modeled  the  temperature- 
dependent  KV  of  biodiesel  and  diesel  fuels  using  the  MLPNN 
model  trained  with  experimental  data.  The  MLPNN  model  de- 
veloped  based  on  temperature  and  biodiesel  content  by  Eryil- 
maz  et  al.  [313]  was  slightly  more  accurate  than  the  exponen- 
tial model ﬁtted to the experimental data in estimating the KV of 
diesel/biodiesel blends. Özgür and Tosun [326] and Ganeshmoor- 
thy  et  al.  [320]  successfully  modeled  the  KV  of  diesel/biodiesel 
blends using the MLPNN model developed based on temperature 
and  biodiesel  fraction.  Gülüm  et  al.  [314]  claimed  that  the  so- 
called “rational model” was somewhat accurate than the developed 
MLPNN model in estimating the KV of diesel/WCO biodiesel blends 
at various biodiesel contents under different temperatures. Kassem 
et al. [327] successfully predicted the temperature-dependent KV 
of diesel/biodiesel blends using the MLPNN model trained based 
on several physical and chemical parameters. 

Hosseini  et  al.  [318]  compared  the  accuracy  of  the  MLPNN 
model with the previously developed semi-theoretical approach in 
estimating the DV of fatty acid esters and biodiesels. The MLPNN 
model developed based on pressure, temperature, Pseudo critical 
density,  and  molecular  mass  was  more  precise  than  the  semi- 
theoretical  model.  Arce  et  al.  [322]  expressed  that  the  MLPNN 
model  trained  based  on  seven  molecular  descriptors  and  three 
measured properties could accurately estimate the KV of various 
biodiesel  blends  derived  from  ethylation  of  castor  oil  and  WCO.

Yu and Zhao [307] succeeded in coupling the MLPNN model with 
the  GA  algorithm  for  modeling  the  KV  of  biodiesel  as  a  func- 
tion of the FAME proﬁle. Zheng et al. [319] found that the KV of 
diesel/biodiesel blends was precisely predicted using the MLPNN, 
CFNN, GRNN, and RBFNN models developed based on temperature, 
biodiesel content, diesel viscosity, and biodiesel viscosity. The de- 
veloped neural models, particularly the CFNN model, were much 
more accurate than the most prominent empirical viscosity mod- 
els. In the CFNN approach, the input and every previous layer are 
systematically connected to the following layers [352] . The GRNN 
neural approach is a type of RBFNN model that solves any regres- 
sion problems in the sense of predicting a probability-distribution 
function [353] . 

According to the study conducted by Kassem et al. [316] , the DV 
of diesel/biodiesel blends was well-predicted by both ANFIS and 
RSM models, even though the developed RSM was somewhat more 
accurate  than  the  trained  ANFIS  model.  In  continuation,  Kassem 
et  al.  [321]  reported  that  the  ANFIS  model  developed  based  on 
temperature and biodiesel content was much more accurate than 
the MLPNN model in generalizing the KV of diesel/biodiesel blend. 
Aminian  and  Zarenezhad  [317] compared  the  prediction  capabil- 
ity  of  ﬁve  soft  computing  approaches,  including  the  SVM,  AN- 
FIS, MLPNN, GA-MLPNN, and SA-MLPNN approaches, for general- 
izing the KV of diesel/biodiesel blends in terms of biodiesel con- 
tent, temperature, carbon atom number, and double bond number. 
Alviso et al. [308] reported that the FAME-based GP model could 
accurately predict the KV of biodiesel compared with the previ- 
ously published MLR models. The selected modeling approach, i.e., 
the  ANFIS  model,  outperformed  the  well-known  biodiesel  math- 
ematical  viscosity  models.  Balabin  et  al.  [324]  deduced  that  the 
MLPNN model trained based on the preprocessed NIRS data was 
superior to the MLR, PCR, and PLS approaches in modeling the KV 
of biodiesel. Cunha et al. [328] modeled the KV of biodiesel us- 
ing multivariate regression models derived from NIRS-FTIR signals. 
Various  data  preprocessing  and  variable  selection  methods  were 
used to eliminate superﬂuous information and select relevant fea- 
tures before modeling using the PLS, RF, and SVM approaches. The 
developed UVE-PLS model was more accurate than the RF and SVM 
approaches in modeling the KV of biodiesel. 

4.3. Density 

Biodiesel fuel density is of speciﬁc importance because the fuel 
pumping and injecting systems operate volumetrically [328] . The 
biodiesel density is slightly higher than petrodiesel, meaning that 
a  more  signiﬁcant  amount  of  biodiesel  will  be  injected  into  the 
combustion chamber by volume-based fuel injecting systems. This 
can result in the formation of engine deposits and lead to incom- 
plete fuel combustion [313] . The higher density of biodiesel fuel 
results  in  the  formation  of  large  fuel  droplets  during  the  atom- 
ization process [354] , which predominantly affects engine perfor- 
mance  and  emission  characteristics.  It  is  noteworthy  that  some 
important  biodiesel  properties  like  CN,  HV,  and  DV  are  directly 
associated  with  its  density  [331] .  Even  though  the  ASTM  D6751 
norm  does  not  consider  any  speciﬁcation  for  biodiesel  density, 
its  limits  in  the  EN  14214  standard  range  from  860–900  kg/m 3 
[304] .  The  chain  length  and  unsaturation  degree  strongly  inﬂu- 
ence the density of biodiesel fuel. The higher the unsaturation de- 
gree  and  the  smaller  the  chain  length,  the  higher  the  biodiesel 
density  [24] .  Although  biodiesel  density  can  be  easily  measured 
using  simple  equipment  like  pycnometer  and  density  meter  at 
a  given  temperature,  this  is  a  time-consuming  process  because 
such measurements are conducted at various temperatures [355] . 
Thus, estimating biodiesel density from its physico-chemical prop- 
erties  using  advanced  ML  techniques  is  an  interesting  research 
subject. 

Among  the  research,  Baroutian  et  al.  [18]  reported  that  the 
MLPNN model with one hidden layer designed for modeling the 
density of vegetable oil biodiesel as a function of the FAEE pro- 
ﬁle  and  temperature  outperformed  the  well-known  theoretical 
models.  In  a  similar  investigation,  Baroutian  et  al.  [330]  found 
that  the  temperature-based  MLPNN  model  trained  for  estimat- 
ing  the  density  of  palm  oil  methyl  esters  was  more  reliable 
than the theoretical and empirical approaches. The FAME proﬁle- 
based  MLPNN  model  developed  by  Giwa  et  al.  [304]  predicted 
biodiesel density with acceptable precision. Unlike the above-listed 
studies, Bukkarapu and Krishnasamy [315] could not successfully 
develop  a  precise  MLPNN  model  for  modeling  the  density  of 
biodiesel in terms of the FAME proﬁle of palm oil biodiesel and 
its mixture with different neat methyl esters. The biodiesel den- 
sity  was  adequately  estimated  using  the  MLPNN  models  trained 
based  on  either  temperature  and  FAME  proﬁle  or  carbon  num- 
ber  and  hydrogen  atom  number  of  FAMEs  [305] .  Özgür  and  To- 
sun [326] and Ganeshmoorthy et al. [320] observed that the den- 
sity of diesel/biodiesel blends could be accurately estimated using 
the MLPNN model developed based on temperature and biodiesel 
content. The MLPNN model trained based on several physical and 
chemical  parameters  could  suﬃciently  estimate  the  density  of 
diesel/biodiesel blends [327] . 

Kassem and Çamur [332] reported that the temperature- and 
pressure-based  ANFIS  model  outperformed  the  RBFNN  model 
slightly  in  predicting  biodiesel  density.  The  ANFIS  model  devel- 
oped by Kassem et al. [321] was more accurate than the MLPNN 
model in predicting the density of diesel/biodiesel blend as a func- 
tion of temperature and biodiesel quantity. Gülüm et al. [331] de- 
duced  that  the  MLPNN  model  developed  based  on  experimental 
data outperformed the exponential model in estimating biodiesel- 
diesel-alcohol density blends. Abooali et al. [333] reported that the 
SGB model developed based on molar mass, normal melting point 
of fatty acid esters, temperature, and pressure was slightly precise 
over the GP model in estimating the density of biodiesel. The SGB 
approach is a type of gradient boosting algorithm developed for 
improving the accuracy of the gradient boosting tree for solving 
nonlinear function-approximation problems [356] . 

Nabipour et al. [334] reported that the PSO-LSSVM model de- 
veloped based on 43 inputs (42 inputs associated with the chemi- 
cal structure of esters along with temperature) outperformed the 
PSO-ANFIS,  MLPNN,  and  RBFNN  models  in  estimating  biodiesel 
density. Balabin et al. [324] used the preprocessed NIRS data for 
modeling  biodiesel  density.  They  found  that  the  trained  MLPNN 
model was precise compared to the developed MLR, PCR, and PLS 
models to estimate biodiesel density. Cunha et al. [335] correlated 
mid-FTIR spectroscopy data with the biodiesel density using the 
PLS and SVM approaches coupled with various data preprocessing 
and variable selections tools. The PLS model showed better estima- 
tion results for the biodiesel density. 

4.4. Flash point 

FP is the key physico-chemical feature of biodiesel fuel since 
it  is  practically  important  for  safety  considerations  in  process- 
ing,  storage,  handling,  shipping,  and  transportation  [357] .  This 
ﬂammability-related property is frequently used to characterize the 
potential for ﬁre and explosion of hazardous chemicals like fuels 
[358] . FP is the lowest temperature, adjusted to the normal atmo- 
spheric pressure of 101.3 kPa, at which a liquid fuel emits a suﬃ- 
cient amount of vapors to form an ignitable/ﬂammable mixture in 
the air [ 351 , 359 ]. In other words, FP is the temperature at which 
the  vapor  pressure  of  a  liquid  fuel  divided  by  the  atmospheric 
pressure is equal to the lower ignitability/ﬂammability limit [357] . 
Generally, there is an inverse association between the FP of a given 
fuel and its volatility [360] . The FP of a given fuel should not be 

61 

M. Aghbashlo, W. Peng, M. Tabatabaei et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100904 

confused with its ﬁre point. At the FP, the ﬁre will cease as soon 
as the ignition source is removed, while at the ﬁre point, the vapor 
will not stop even after eliminating the ignition source [361] . The 
FP of biodiesel fuel must be at least 130 °C according to the ASTM 
D6751 norm, while the minimum value of this property is 120 °C 
in the EN 14214 standard [362] . Generally, the FP of biodiesel fuel 
is higher than its petroleum counterpart, making it safer for trans- 
portation and storage [363] . However, the higher FP of biodiesel 
leads to carbon deposit formation in the combustion chamber due 
to inadequate cold engine startup, excessive misﬁring, and longer 
ID [13] . It is worth quoting that increasing the fatty acid saturation 
degree of biodiesel fuels increases its FP [354] . The FP of biodiesel 
fuel can be reliably measured using various experimental appara- 
tus, but the process is lengthy and costly. Accordingly, determining 
the FP of biodiesel fuel using the advanced ML methods developed 
based on its structural features can reduce the measurement cost 
and time. 

In this context, Giwa et al. [304] inferred that the FAME proﬁle- 
based MLPNN could reasonably estimate the FP of biodiesel. Agar- 
wal et al. [323] demonstrated that the MLPNN model developed 
based on the FAME proﬁle was superior to the LR model in ap- 
praising the ﬂash and ﬁre points of biodiesel. The MLPNN model 
trained on different combinations of CI, FP distillation curves, and 
speciﬁc gravity could reasonably predict the FP of diesel/biodiesel 
blends [306] . The GP model developed based on the FAME proﬁle 
by Alviso et al. [308] was more precise than the MLR models re- 
ported in the published literature. 

4.5. Heating value 

The  quantity  of  thermal  energy  released  during  the  combus- 
tion of a given amount of a given fuel is called “heating value”. 
This energetic indicator is presented in two forms, i.e., higher heat- 
ing value (gross caloriﬁc value or higher caloriﬁc value) and lower 
heating  value  (net  caloriﬁc  value  or  lower  caloriﬁc  value).  The 
higher heating value is the quantity of heat released by a given 
amount of fuel once it is completely burned, and the combustion 
products are cooled back to a standard temperature of 25 °C [364] . 
The complete combustion means that, for example, all carbon and 
hydrogen atoms are converted to carbon dioxide and water, respec- 
tively [365] . The lower heating value is computed by subtracting 
the heat of vaporization of the water generated during the com- 
bustion from the higher heating value [366] . Generally, the HV of 
biodiesel is about 10% lower than petrodiesel, mainly attributing to 
its structural oxygen [233] . 

Notably,  the  structural  oxygen  of  biodiesel  partially  compen- 
sates for its energetic content since it propels the combustion pro- 
cess towards completion. There is no speciﬁcation for the HV of 
biodiesel in the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards, even though 
the minimum HV is 35 MJ/kg (biodiesel for heating purposes) ac- 
cording to the EN 14213 [367] . The HV of biodiesel increases by 
increasing  the  carbon  number  in  the  fuel  molecules,  increasing 
the ratio of carbon and hydrogen to oxygen, and decreasing the 
double  bond  number  [315] .  The  higher  heating  value  of  a  given 
biodiesel  fuel  can  be  experimentally  determined  using  a  simple 
bomb calorimeter and, accordingly, its lower heating value can be 
mathematically computed using a linear equation. However, deter- 
mining  the  heating  value  of  a  given  biodiesel  a  priori  using  ac- 
curate  models  and  computational  approaches  can  provide  useful 
information concerning its suitability for diesel engines and avoid 
the laborious and erroneous experimental measurements. 

On this subject, Najaﬁ et al. [336] used the MLPNN approach 
to model the HV of biodiesel fuels derived from several vegetable 
oils. The developed FAEE proﬁle-based MLPNN model could be re- 
liably  used  for  estimating  the  HV  of  the  produced  biodiesel  fu- 
els. The FAME proﬁle-based MLPNN and mathematical models de- 

veloped  by  Cheenkachorn  [303]  were  effectively  used  to  model 
the HV of biodiesel fuel. On the contrary, Bukkarapu and Krish- 
nasamy [315] did not accurately model the HV of biodiesel using 
the  MLPNN  model  developed  on  the  FAME  content  of  palm  oil 
biodiesel and its blends with neat methyl esters. 

4.6. Cold ﬂow properties 

One of the signiﬁcant drawbacks of fueling diesel engines with 
biodiesel  in  regions  with  cold  weather  is  its  unfavorable  low- 
temperature  ﬂow  characteristics  or  cold  ﬂow  properties  [283] . 
These properties are determined using three main indicators, i.e., 
CP, PP, and CFPP [307] . CP is the lowest temperature at which the 
ﬁne solidiﬁed biowax crystals become visible as a cloud because 
of crystals formation and saturates solidiﬁcation [38] . These fast- 
growing and rapid agglomerating crystals can clog fuel lines, ﬁl- 
ters,  and  injectors  [24] ,  leading  to  diﬃculties  in  engine  starting 
and  operation  [328] .  PP  is  the  lowest  temperature  at  which  the 
fuel ceases to ﬂow due to its gelatinization due to the formation 
of a suﬃcient amount of biowax [129] . CFPP is the lowest tem- 
perature at which the fuel plugs a standardized ﬁltration device at 
a speciﬁc time due to crystallization, solidiﬁcation, and gelatiniza- 
tion of fuel components [368] . This indicator is often used to mea- 
sure the low-temperature operability of diesel fuels, reﬂecting their 
cold climate performance [368] . PP is the lowest temperature used 
to characterize the cold ﬂow properties of diesel fuels, while the 
CP  is  the  highest  temperature.  The  CFPP  of  a  given  fuel  usually 
lies between its CP and PP [338] . No lower limits have been de- 
ﬁned for CP, PP, and CFPP in ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards 
[313] . The CP, PP, and CFPP values of biodiesel fuel are higher than 
petrodiesel  [24]  since  it  contains  higher  concentrations  of  high- 
melting-point saturated long-chain fatty acids [38] . The cold ﬂow 
properties of biodiesel fuel can be improved by decreasing its chain 
length [323] and increasing its saturation degree [351] . However, 
reducing the chain length of fatty acid esters can negatively lower 
the OSI and CN of biodiesel fuels [38] , even though saturating more 
carbon chains is in favor of CP, PP, CFPP, and CN. Generally, esti- 
mating the CP, PP, and CFPP of biodiesel fuel using theoretical and 
empirical models is problematic since biodiesel is a thermodynam- 
ically complex system. This issue can be effectively addressed using 
the advanced ML methods developed based on experimental data. 
In this regard, Yu and Zhao [307] precisely predicted the CFPP 
of biodiesel using the GA-MLPNN combination developed based on 
the FAME proﬁle. The FAME proﬁle-based MLPNN model developed 
by Agarwal et al. [323] outperformed the LR model in generalizing 
the CP and PP of biodiesel. Al-Shanableh et al. [338] successfully 
estimated the CP, PP, and CFPP of biodiesel using the FAME proﬁle- 
based  MLPNN  model.  In  a  similar  study  but  with  different  in- 
put variables (i.e., saturated, mono-saturated, and poly-unsaturated 
fatty acid contents), they found that the developed ANFIS models 
could accurately estimate the CP, PP, and CFPP of biodiesel. Alviso 
et al. [308] could not successfully estimate the CP, PP, and CFPP of 
biodiesel, particularly PP, using the FAME-based GP model. Razavi 
et al. [340] found that their developed PSO-LSSVM model was ac- 
curate than the ANFIS model reported by Mostafaei [339] in mod- 
eling the CP and PP of biodiesel. The input parameters in modeling 
CP were the molar mass, carbon number, and weight percent of 
saturated fatty acids, while the molar mass, carbon number, and 
double bond number were the input parameters in estimating PP. 
Balabin and Saﬁeva [337] compared the accuracy of the MLPNN, 
MLR, PCR, and PLS approaches in modeling the CFPP of biodiesel 
from the preprocessed NIRS data. They reported that the developed 
MLPNN architecture was superior to the other models in tracking 
the  CFPP  of  biodiesel.  Cunha  et  al.  [ 328 , 335 ]  attempted  to  esti- 
mate the CFPP of biodiesel from mid-FTIR and NIRS-FTIR signals. 
The elimination of superﬂuous information and selecting relevant 

62

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100904 

features were ﬁrst performed using several data preprocessing and 
variable selection techniques. The preprocessed and selected data 
were  then  fed  into  the  PLS,  RF,  and  SVM  approaches  to  predict 
the CFPP of biodiesel. The SVM model developed based on both 
mid-FTIR and NIRS-FTIR signals could better predict the CFPP of 
biodiesel than the PLS and RF models. 

4.7. Iodine value 

IV quantiﬁes the degree of unsaturation (double bond number) 
of biodiesel irrespective of the relative contributions of mono-, di- 
, tri-, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids [38] . Brieﬂy, this parame- 
ter indicates the susceptibility to oxidation of biodiesel. Generally, 
the  higher  the  IV,  the  higher  the  susceptibility  to  biodiesel  oxi- 
dation and vice versa [313] . There is a direct association between 
the  IV  of  biodiesel  with  its  KV/DV,  CN,  PP,  CP,  and  CFPP  [368] . 
The polymerization of glycerides is also greatly inﬂuenced by this 
property [369] . Notably, the oxidation and polymerization products 
can result in the formation of deposits in the injectors of diesel 
engines, consequently leading to poor combustion and high emis- 
sions [283] . This index can be expressed as the quantity of grams 
of iodine required to thoroughly saturate double and triple bonds 
of a sample of 100 g of biodiesel [370] . According to the EN 14214 
norm, the upper limit of IV is 120 g I 
2 per 100 g of biodiesel, while 
the ASTM D6751 standard does not contain any speciﬁcation for 
this index [287] . The IV of biodiesel decreases with increasing car- 
bon chains indicating its strong dependency on the molecular mass 
[129] . Higher esters like ethyl or propyl can be used to overcome 
IV restrictions speciﬁed by the EN 14214 standard [371] . In general, 
the IV of biodiesel can be determined using several standard lab- 
oratory  methods,  which  are  time-consuming,  chemical-intensive, 
and  error-susceptible  procedures.  These  mandate  the  use  of  ad- 
vanced modeling and simulation techniques to predict the IV of 
biodiesel from its chemical and physical attributes. 

On this matter, Agarwal et al. [323] and Barradas Filho et al. 
[325]  compared  the  accuracy  of  the  FAME  proﬁle-based  MLPNN 
approach  with  the  LR  method  in  estimating  the  IV  of  biodiesel. 
They concluded that the MLPNN model was a better option than 
the developed LR model. Using the FAME proﬁle-based GA-MLPNN 
model, Yu and Zhao [307] adequately estimated the IV of biodiesel. 
Using the preprocessed NIRS data, Balabin and Saﬁeva [337] pre- 
dicted the IV of biodiesel using several modeling techniques, in- 
cluding the MLPNN, MLR, PCR, and PLS approaches. The developed 
MLPNN model was the most precise approach for modeling the IV 
of biodiesel. Alviso et al. [308] concluded that the accuracy of the 
GP model developed on the FAME proﬁle was acceptable in esti- 
mating the IV of biodiesel. The PSO-LSSVM model developed by 
Razavi et al. [340] based on the double bond number along with 
weight percent of mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids outper- 
formed the ANFIS model designed by Mostafaei [339] in estimating 
the IV of biodiesel. 

4.8. Oxidation stability 

Despite  the  unique  advantages  of  biodiesel  fuel  over 
petrodiesel,  it  is  more  prone  to  oxidation/auto-oxidation  due 
to its high chemical activity  [325] . This elementary drawback of 
biodiesel is inﬂuenced by several factors, including its fatty acid 
molecular  mass,  carbon  double  bond  number,  natural  antioxi- 
dant content, contamination level, storage/transportation/handling 
conditions,  container  material,  and  storage  conditions  (light/air) 
[ 307 , 372 ].  Generally,  the  higher  the  unsaturated  fatty  acids  and 
the higher the double bonds, the lower the OS of biodiesel [307] . 
Aldehydes, ketones, peroxides, epoxides, alcohols, and short-chain 
carboxylic acids are the main species generated during biodiesel 

oxidation [325] . These oxidation products can lead to the forma- 
tion  of  insoluble  sediments  and  gums,  increasing  fuel  viscosity, 
clogging  fuel  ﬁlters,  coking  fuel  injection  systems,  eroding  en- 
gine metallic parts, and forming deposits within the combustion 
chamber [38] . OSI or induction period determined by the standard 
accelerated  Rancimat  oxidation  method,  as  established  by  the 
EN  14112  norm,  is  the  most  widely  used  indicator  of  biodiesel 
OS  [ 373 , 374 ].  In  this  method,  the  volatiles  oxidation  products 
generated  during  the  accelerated  oxidation  of  biodiesel  at  110 °C 
are retained in a vessel containing distilled/deionized water while 
monitoring  the  continual  increase  of  the  water  conductivity 
[375] .  Brieﬂy,  OSI  measures  the  duration  that  the  fuel  sample 
can  withstand  against  oxidation  [ 38 , 325 ].  The  minimum  values 
of  OSI  speciﬁed  by  the  EN  14214  and  ASTM  D6751  norms  are 
eight  hours  and  three  hours,  respectively  [38] .  Generally,  in  the 
absence of natural antioxidants like tocopherols and tocotrienols 
in the biodiesel body, synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate, 
butylated  hydroxyanisole,  butylated  hydroxytoluene,  and  tert- 
butylhydroquinone  are  required  to  enhance  its  OS  and  shelf  life 
[ 373 , 376 ]. 

Despite the simplicity of the Rancimat method for measuring 
the OS of biodiesel, the process is time-consuming [377] . Accord- 
ingly, it is of great value to develop accurate and reliable math- 
ematical  models  to  determine  this  critical  quality  parameter  of 
biodiesel  using  experimental  or  theoretical  data.  In  this  context, 
the MLPNN model developed based on the FAME proﬁle by Bar- 
radas  et  al.  [325]  satisfactorily  ﬁtted  the  experimental  induction 
period  data  of  biodiesel.  Dehghani  et  al.  [378]  used  the  MLPNN 
and  RBFNN  methods  to  estimate  the  OS  of  canola  oil  as  poten- 
tial  biodiesel  feedstock  during  storage.  The  RBFNN  model  devel- 
oped based on fatty acid proﬁle and storage time was more ac- 
curate  than  the  MLPNN  model.  Sanaeifar  and  Jafari  [379]  corre- 
lated the OS of olive oil as potential biodiesel feedstock with di- 
electric spectroscopy and computer vision data using the MLPNN, 
SVM, and MLR approaches. The set-up developed for investigating 
the OS of olive oil is shown in Fig. 30 . Two permittivity proper- 
ties (i.e., dielectric constant and loss factor) at different radio fre- 
quencies in the range of 40 kHz–20 MHz and nine color features 
(overall 393 data patterns) were used in developing the predictive 
models. All the models developed based on the features selected 
by the correlation-based feature selection method, particularly the 
SVM model, indicated a good agreement with the data obtained 
from the Rancimat oxidation method. 

4.9. Other applications of machine learning technology in modeling 
biodiesel properties 

In  addition  to  the  routine  applications  of  ML  techniques  in 
modeling well-known physico-chemical attributes of biodiesel fuel, 
as summarized above, this unique tool has other applications in 
biodiesel researches. For example, Arce et al. [322] tried to pre- 
dict the biodiesel acidity and ketone index from three measured 
independent variables and different molecular descriptors of fatty 
acids using the MLPNN approach. The MLPNN model trained based 
on seven molecular descriptors and three experimental variables 
could adequately predict the investigated dependent variables of 
biodiesel blends. Bukkarapu and Krishnasamy [315] attempted to 
estimate the surface tension of biodiesel using the MLPNN model 
trained  based  on  the  FAME  composition  of  palm  oil  biodiesel 
and its mixture with different neat methyl esters. The developed 
MLPNN model did not outperform the LR approach in modeling 
the surface tension of  biodiesel. The FAME  proﬁle-based MLPNN 
model used by Agarwal et al. [323] was much more eﬃcient than 
the LR model in estimating the saponiﬁcation value of biodiesel. 
Notably, the saponiﬁcation value is a measure of the mean molec- 
ular mass of fatty acids in given biodiesel and is determined by

weighing the quantity of potassium hydroxide required to saponify 
one gram of biodiesel under the conditions described [380] . 

Wang and Gao [381] and Wei et al. [382] applied the MLPNN 
and  PSO-ANFIS  approaches,  respectively,  for  modeling  the  water 
absorbance (water content) of biodiesel in diesel/biodiesel blends 
as  a  function  of  biodiesel  content  and  temperature.  They  found 
that both developed models could satisfactorily predict the water 
content of diesel/biodiesel blends. Bampi et al. [383] compared the 
accuracy of the PLS and MLPNN approaches in estimating the av- 
erage droplet size and water content of biodiesel emulsions using 
the NIRS signals. The developed MLPNN model outperformed the 
PLS model in predicting the average droplet size of emulsion fuels, 
while  the  opposite  observation  was  made  for  water  content.  De 
Oliveira et al. [306] predicted the sulfur content of diesel/biodiesel 
blends using the MLPNN model developed as a function of differ- 
ent combinations of CI, FP, distillation curves, and speciﬁc gravity. 
Rocha and Sheen [384] used the PLS and SVM approaches with un- 
certainty estimation to predict some physico-chemical characteris- 
tics  of  petro-derivatives  and  biodiesel  based  on  the  GC-MS  pro- 
ﬁle  ( Fig.  31 ).  Generally,  the  designed  SVM  model  provided  bet- 
ter results compared to the PLS model in estimating the physico- 
chemical properties of the investigated fuels, including density (at 
15 and 60 °C), KV (at 40 and 60 °C), PP, AV, and base number. Never- 
theless, the authors concluded that the PLS model was reliable for 
most of the investigated physico-chemical properties due to evi- 
dence of overﬁtting in the SVM model. 

In  a  promising  study,  Brusamarello  et  al.  [385]  applied  the 
MLPNN and PLS approaches to estimate the concentration of es- 
ters  during  basic  and  enzymatic  ethylation  of  soybean  oil  us- 
ing  ultraviolet-visible  spectroscopy  data.  The  MLPNN  model  was 
trained based on four absorbance wavelengths (i.e., 202, 203, 204, 
211 nm), while the PCA-preprocessed data were used in the PLS 
model. The obtained spectroscopy data were used in both raw and 
derivative  forms  during  model  development.  The  MLPNN  model 
with  one  hidden  layer  developed  based  on  the  derivative  spec- 
trum could appropriately estimate the ethyl ester concentrations 
or the reaction progress compared with the PLS model. Balabin and 
Saﬁeva [337] and Balabin et al. [324] detected the fractional com- 
position (distillation temperatures), water content, and methanol 
content  of  biodiesel  using  the  MLPNN,  MLR,  PCR,  and  PLS  ap- 

proaches  developed  based  on  the  preprocessed  NIRS  data.  The 
MLPNN model was much more eﬃcient than the other methods 
used. Cunha et al. [335] stated that the PLS model developed based 
on the preprocessed and selected mid-FTIR data was more precise 
than the SVM model in estimating the refractive index of biodiesel. 
The refractive index represents the speed of light traveled within 
the  material.  This  physico-chemical  property  enables  the  assess- 
ment of the predominant ester saturation degree [335] . 

Dos Santos et al. [386] applied ﬁve multivariate statistical meth- 
ods to discriminate among biodiesel sources and determine their 
quantity in diesel/biodiesel blends using the preprocessed FTIR sig- 
nals.  The  multivariate  statistical  used  were  the  PCA,  SVM,  PLS- 
DA,  soft  independent  modeling  of  class  analogy,  and  hierarchi- 
cal clustering analysis approaches. All the investigated multivari- 
ate methods, particularly the SVM model, could adequately clas- 
sify diesel/biodiesel samples containing up to 10% biodiesel. Sim- 
ilarly,  Rocha  et  al.  [387]  applied  the  PCA,  SVM,  and  hierarchical 
clustering  analysis  approaches  to  detect  biodiesel  origin.  At  the 
same  time,  the  PLS  and  multivariate  adaptive  regression  splines 
methods were used to quantify biodiesel in binary biodiesel/diesel 
blends based on the preprocessed NIR signals. The combination of 
the  SVM  approach  with  the  PLS/multivariate  adaptive  regression 
splines method was proven to be a proper approach for estimating 
the biodiesel content and its origin in biodiesel/diesel blends. Gal- 
hardo et al. [388] compared the capacity of the SOM and PCA tech- 
niques to differentiate diesel/biodiesel blends based on the mid- 
FTIR data. The SOM model trained on the pre-processed data could 
ﬁnd differences between biodiesel origins, which was not obtained 
by the PCA approach. 

Petkov et al. [389] successfully grouped biodiesel samples based 
on their original feedstocks using the adaptive resonance theory-2 
ANN model developed on the gas chromatographic FAME proﬁle. 
In a preliminary and promising study, Giordani et al. [81] deter- 
mined the amount of babassu biodiesel in diesel/biodiesel blends 
using the one-hidden layer MLPNN model trained on the smell- 
prints gathered via an electronic nose. The origin of biodiesel in 
pure and blended samples (80% diesel + 20% biodiesel) was recog- 
nized  using  the  e-nose  smellprints  classiﬁed  by  the  PCA  model. 
Mahmodi et al. [390] detected the biodiesel source and its quan- 
tity in diesel/biodiesel blends using the SVM and DA (linear and

Fig. 31.  The research methodology used for estimating some physico-chemical characteristics of petro-derivatives and biodiesel. The obtained GC-MS data were presented to 
the PLS and SVM models, and their uncertainty in terms of conﬁdence limits was assessed by bootstrapping technique. This uncertainty estimation method uses the random 
sampling approach to create many artiﬁcial datasets to estimate the uncertainty of the developed models. Redrawn with permission from Rocha and Sheen [384] . Copyright

quadratic DA) approaches. The model was developed based on the 
smellprint  data  gathered  using  eight  metal  oxide  semiconductor 
sensors. The SVM model was superior to the DA models in detect- 
ing and classifying diesel/biodiesel blends. 

Balabin and Saﬁeva [391] attempted to correlate the NIRS sig- 
nals of biodiesel samples with their original feedstocks. The PCA 
approach was applied to detect outliers and reduce the dimension- 
ality of the gathered NIR spectral data, while the KNN, SVM, reg- 
ularized DA, and PLS method/projection on latent structures tech- 
niques were used to classify the preprocessed data. The developed 
SVM approach showed the highest eﬃciency for biodiesel classiﬁ- 
cation by original feedstock. Oliveira et al. [392] used several cal- 
ibration models, including the PLS, PCR, and MLPNN approaches, 
to  detect  adulteration  in  diesel/biodiesel  blend  (diesel  contain- 
ing 2 and 5 vol.% biodiesel) based on spectroscopic data (Fourier 
transform  near-infrared  spectrometry  and  Fourier  transform  Ra- 
man spectrometry). The modular feedforward MLPNN calibration 
model  trained  on  Fourier  transform  Raman  spectrometry  exhib- 
ited the highest accuracy among all the developed approaches. In 
an  interesting  study,  de  Souza  Schaumlöffel  et  al.  [373]  directly 
determined four phenolic antioxidants in biodiesel samples using 
the  MLPNN  model  designed  based  on  differential  pulse  voltam- 
metry signals. The DT approach was ﬁrst used to preprocess the 
obtained  signals  and  select  relevant  information  (features)  be- 
fore  MLPNN  training,  as  shown  in  Fig.  32 .  Overall,  the  MLPNN 
model trained based on DT outputs provided a high correlation be- 
tween actual and predicted values for all the phenolic antioxidants 
investigated. 

Zarein  et  al.  [393]  correlated  the  FAME  content  and  FP  of 
biodiesel  with  its  permittivity  properties  (i.e.,  dielectric  constant 
and loss factor) measured at microwave frequencies of 434, 915, 
and 2450 MHz using the MLPNN, RBFNN, RSM, and LR approaches. 
The FAME content and FP of ﬁsh oil-based biodiesel samples syn- 
thesized  at  different  reaction  times  and  catalyst  concentrations 
were used as output  dependent variables, while their permittiv- 

ity  constants  were  used  as  independent  input  parameters.  The 
RBFNN model developed based on permittivity constants at a mi- 
crowave  frequency  of  2450  MHz  could  accurately  estimate  the 
FAME content and FP of biodiesel. In an innovative study, Rash- 
vand  et  al.  [394]  used  the  MLPNN  approach  to  detect  biodiesel 
origin (WCO or canola biodiesel) and its quantity mixed with mi- 
croalgae biodiesel. The required data for training the MLPNN model 
was obtained using image processing and dielectric spectroscopy 
techniques. The obtained raw signals were then processed using 
the DA and SVM approaches to extract the relevant features. The 
MLPNN trained based on the SVM-extracted features successfully 
detected the origin and quantity of the methyl esters added to mi- 
croalgae biodiesel. Abooali et al. [333] attempted to model sound 
speed, isentropic compressibility, and isothermal compressibility of 
biodiesel using the SGB and GP approaches as a function of tem- 
perature, pressure, molar mass, and normal melting point of fatty 
acid esters. The accuracy of the developed SGB model was some- 
what better than the GP model in estimating all the investigated 
properties. 

In  an  interesting  study,  Lopes  et  al.  [395]  directly  classiﬁed 
biodiesels (98 samples) based on their compliance with four qual- 
ity parameters using the DT, KNN, SVM, and MLPNN approaches. 
The  input  variables  were  the  FAME  proﬁle,  while  density,  KV, 
OS, and IV were the output quality parameters. Synthetic minor- 
ity  over-sampling  technique  was  used  to  create  three,  two,  two, 
and  one  database  (overall  eight  different  databases)  for  density, 
KV, OS, and IV, respectively, with respect to the EN 14214, ASTM 
D6751, and RANP 45/2014 standards. This was conducted to cope 
with imbalanced data, i.e., various numbers of compliant and non- 
compliant  samples,  as  shown  in  Fig.  33 .  The  DT  and  KNN  ap- 
proaches could provide better accuracy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity 
over the SVM and MLPNN approaches in classifying biodiesel sam- 
ples. The authors also concluded that the developed direct classi- 
ﬁers were superior to the indirect classiﬁers (empirical equations) 
in the classiﬁcation of biodiesels.

Kimura  et  al.  [396]  applied  the  SOM  approach  to  separate 
biodiesel  samples  doped  with  different  natural  antioxidant  ex- 
tracts,  including  senna  leaves,  hibiscus  ﬂowers,  and  blackberries. 
The  model  inputs  were  the  OSI,  relative  protection  factor,  rate 
constant,  water  content,  density,  KV,  AV,  FP,  CP,  and  PP  of  the 
prepared  biodiesel  samples.  The  relative  protection  factor  was 
the most inﬂuential property in the classiﬁcation process accord- 

ing  to  the  weight  maps  among  the  input  variables.  Two  dis- 
tinct clusters were observed, one for the extract of senna leaves 
and the other for the extracts of blackberries and hibiscus ﬂow- 
ers.  Rocabruno-Valdés  et  al.  [397]  used  the  MLPNN  approach  to 
predict  the  corrosion  rate  of  metals  in  diesel/biodiesel  blends 
as  a  function  of  24  different  parameters,  including  metal  com- 
position,  biodiesel  proﬁle,  biodiesel  content,  temperature,  total

acid  number,  and  exposure  time.  The  MLPNN  model  developed 
based on electrochemical noise and literature data could satisfac- 
torily estimate the corrosive effect of biodiesel on metals. López- 
Gamboa et al. [398] successfully modeled the thermal conductivity 
of biodiesel doped with various metallic nanoparticles using the 
MLPNN model with one hidden layer developed based on six input 
variables. 

5. Applications of machine learning technology in modeling 
biodiesel-fueled engines 

The handling, spraying, atomization, evaporation, and burning 
properties  of  biodiesel  are  substantially  different  than  those  of 
petrodiesel.  This  could  be  attributed  to  the  higher  CN,  KV/DV, 
FP,  density,  surface  tension,  lubricity,  and  oxygen  content  of 

67

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100904 

biodiesel compared with petrodiesel [399–401] . Accordingly, per- 
formance  indices,  combustion  characteristics,  and  exhaust  emis- 
sions  of  the  diesel  engines  powered  by  biodiesel  and  its  blends 
with petrodiesel are signiﬁcantly different than those fueled with 
petrodiesel.  As  conducting  calibration  and  optimization  experi- 
ments  under  the  entire  range  of  operating  conditions  is  labor- 
intensive and cost-expensive, establishing associations between in- 
put variables and output responses of biodiesel-fueled engines us- 
ing robust function approximation techniques is vital. These issues 
have directed research efforts to use ML technology for mapping 
the output responses of biodiesel-fueled engines. The most impor- 
tant applications of ML techniques in modeling performance, com- 
bustion, and emission parameters of biodiesel-fueled engines are 
presented in Table 12 . 

5.1. Combustion parameters 

To  study  diesel/biodiesel  engines’  behavior  in  detail,  various 
combustion parameters, including EGT, ID, CD, HRR, and ICP, are 
measured during the experimentation. The combustion character- 
istics of diesel engines are markedly affected by biodiesel in fuel 
blends  because  of  its  different  physico-chemical  attributes  from 
petrodiesel. 

EGT is an indication of the quantity of heat released during the 
combustion process within internal combustion engines. This indi- 
cator has been regarded as a performance indicator [467–469] or a 
combustion parameter [470–472] in the previously published stud- 
ies. As a rule of thumb, a performance indicator of a given energy 
system  should  be  directly  associated  with  its  useful  energy.  Ac- 
cordingly, EGT is supposed to be a combustion parameter herein. 
The formation of pollutants in internal combustion engines is also 
partially  inﬂuenced  by  this  parameter  [473] .  Overall,  due  to  the 
lower HV of biodiesel, the EGT of biodiesel-fueled engines was re- 
portedly lower than those powered by petrodiesel [ 469 , 474–479 ]. 
The  inbuilt  oxygen  content  of  biodiesel  could  also  cause  earlier 
combustion and lower EGT [468] . Besides, the lower ﬂame tem- 
perature of biodiesel than petrodiesel could be responsible for this 
reduction  [480] .  The  short  ID  of  biodiesel,  because  of  its  high 
CN, could further decrease EGT [479] . In contrast with the discus- 
sions mentioned above, biodiesel could increase EGT because of in- 
creased BSFC [481] . Notably, increasing BSFC could lead to the gen- 
eration of more thermal energy inside the combustion chamber. 

ID is deﬁned as the time interval from the start of fuel injec- 
tion to the inception of combustion [482] . The results of different 
studies demonstrated that biodiesel could lead to shorter ID com- 
pared with petrodiesel [4 82–4 87] . The high inbuilt oxygen content 
of biodiesel could advance the start of combustion, leading to ear- 
lier ignition [483] . The high CN of biodiesel could also cause short- 
ened  ID  [487] .  The  lighter  compounds  evolved  because  of  ther- 
mal cracking (volatilization) of biodiesel constituents at higher in- 
cylinder temperatures got ignited earlier, resulting in reduced ID 
[485] . 

CD is deﬁned as the time from the onset of combustion to a 
90% CHR [488] . Generally, a fuel with a high burning rate is pre- 
ferred for diesel engines since it shortens CD, reducing heat loss 
to the cylinder wall [489] . In general, the shorter CD was reported 
for biodiesel compared with diesel [490] . The inbuilt oxygen con- 
tent of biodiesel could promote the combustion process, particu- 
larly the diffusion combustion phase [490] . However, it was also 
observed that biodiesel could prolong CD because of the forma- 
tion of the heterogeneous air-fuel mixture due to its higher vis- 
cosity [491] . Furthermore, the shorter ID of biodiesel could decel- 
erate the burning rate of the air-fuel mix, slowing down pressure 
and temperature rise [492] . Therefore, most of the injected fuel got 
combusted in the diffusion phase rather than the premixed phase, 
which could prolong CD [493] . 

HRR, often presented in HRR max  and CHR forms, is crucial for 
understanding and characterizing the combustion process. This pa- 
rameter quantiﬁes the amount of thermal energy released from the 
injected fuel when combusted. As reported by several researchers, 
the HRR max value of biodiesel was lower than that of petrodiesel 
[4 94–4 97] .  The  main  reason  for  this  issue  could  be  the  low  HV 
of biodiesel [498] . The high viscosity of biodiesel could undermine 
the combustion process due to the deteriorated atomization pro- 
cess, lowering HRR max [497] . The shorter ID of biodiesel resulting 
from  its  high  CN  could  reduce  HRR max  by  preventing  fuel  accu- 
mulation in the premixed combustion phase [495] . Compared with 
diesel, the higher irreversibility of the biodiesel combustion pro- 
cess could decrease HRR max [496] . According to several works pub- 
lished in this domain, biodiesel could reduce CHR due to its low 
energetic  content  and  high  viscosity  [499–502] .  However,  it  was 
also reported that using oxygenated biodiesel could boost CHR by 
inducing complete combustion of fuel [503] . 

Generally, biodiesel fuel could elevate ICP since its fuel-bound 
oxygen  content  could  accelerate  the  combustion  process  in  the 
course of the premixed combustion phase [ 487 , 504 ]. The shorter 
ID of biodiesel fuel caused by its higher CN could also increase ICP 
due to improved combustion eﬃciency [505] . On the contrary, it 
was claimed that using biodiesel could lower ICP [506] . The forma- 
tion of the heterogeneous air-fuel mixture due to the high viscosity 
and density of biodiesel was regarded as the main reason for this 
reduction [506] . 

The MLPNN models developed on engine operating parameters 
and fuel blend could adequately model the EGT of the diesel en- 
gines  powered  by  diesel/biodiesel  or  diesel/biodiesel/oxygenated 
additive  blends,  as  documented  by  many  authors  [ 403 , 404 , 406–
408 , 411 , 412 , 414 , 415 , 420 , 421 , 424 ]. In a study carried out by Gokalp 
et al. [438] , the EGT of the engine operating on jet, marine, and 
diesel  fuels  blended  with  soybean  oil  biodiesel  was  accurately 
modeled  using  the  MLPNN  model  developed  on  engine  operat- 
ing conditions and a fuel property (HV). In an interesting study, 
Canakci et al. [440] satisfactorily correlated physico-chemical at- 
tributes  of  fuel  blends  with  the  EGT  of  the  engine  powered  by 
diesel/biodiesel blends. The MLPNN model trained on load condi- 
tion and fuel characteristics satisfactorily estimated the EGT of the 
dual-fuel  diesel-hydrogen  engine  ignited  with  diesel/Jatropha  oil 
biodiesel blends [4 4 4] . The MLPNN models trained on engine op- 
erating parameters and biodiesel quantity by Aydın et al. [423] and 
Uslu [453] were much more eﬃcient than the RSM model in esti- 
mating the EGT of the engines fueled with diesel/biodiesel blends. 
Kumar  et  al.  [458]  found  that  the  capacity  of  the  MLPNN  and 
RBFNN models developed on engine operating parameters and fuel 
blend  was  close  to  each  other  in  modeling  the  EGT  of  the  en- 
gine  running  on  diesel/WCO  biodiesel  blends,  while  both  of  the 
developed neural models outperformed the LR model. Hosoz et al. 
[459]  conﬁrmed  the  reliability  of  the  ANFIS  approach  developed 
based  on  fuel  type  and  engine  operating  conditions  to  estimate 
the EGT of the engine working with diesel/rapeseed oil biodiesel 
blends. 

Further  to  the  EGT,  several  researchers  observed  that  the 
other  combustion  characteristics  of  the  diesel  engines  running 
on diesel/biodiesel or diesel/biodiesel/oxygenated additive blends 
could  also  be  modeled  well  using  the  MLPNN  models  devel- 
oped  based  on  engine  operating  parameters  and  fuel  charac- 
teristics  [ 98 , 424–436 , 4 46 , 4 48 , 455 ].  On  the  contrary,  Ismail  et  al. 
[447]  could  not  satisfactorily  predict  all  the  studied  combustion 
parameters of the engine fueled with diesel/biodiesel blends using 
the MLPNN model developed based on engine operating param- 
eters, fuel type, and fuel mass ﬂow rate. In an innovative study, 
Menon  and  Krishnasamy  [41]  successfully  associated  the  FAME 
proﬁle of biodiesel with some combustion indicators of the light- 
and heavy-duty diesel engines powered by various vegetable-based

biodiesels under varying load conditions using the MLPNN model. 
Rao and Krishna [456] claimed that the MLPNN model optimized 
by  the  FF  algorithm  could  better  estimate  combustion  indices 
of  the  diesel/biodiesel-powered  engine  as  a  function  of  CR  and 
biodiesel  concentration  compared  with  the  classical  MLPNN  ap- 
proach. Notably, the nature-inspired FF algorithm is a population- 
based optimization approach that mimics ﬁreﬂies’ ﬂashing behav- 
ior  [507] .  Silitonga  et  al.  [464]  deduced  that  the  KELM  model 
trained  on  biodiesel  quantity  and  engine  speed  could  precisely 
predict  some  combustion  indicators  of  the  engine  fueled  with 
diesel/Jatropha biodiesel blends. 

5.2. Performance indices 

Several performance indices, including BP, BSFC/BSEC, and BTE, 
are frequently used to characterize diesel/biodiesel engines. Using 
biodiesel in neat or blended form can signiﬁcantly affect these in- 
dices because of its inherent differences from petrodiesel. 

BP  is  deﬁned  as  the  rate  at  which  the  rotational  shaft  work 
produced  by  the  engine  is  performed  [508] .  Several  researchers 
claimed that biodiesel and its blends with petrodiesel had lower 
BP than petrodiesel [ 441 , 509–513 ]. This could be mainly ascribed 
to the lower HV of biodiesel versus petrodiesel [514] . However, it 
was also reported that biodiesel could not signiﬁcantly affect the 
BP of diesel engines [515] . Indeed, volume-based fuel pumping sys- 
tems could inject more high-density biodiesel into the combustion 
chamber, thereby compensating for its low HV [515] . On the con- 
trary,  some  authors  observed  that  biodiesel  and  its  blend  could 
produce  more  BP  than  petrodiesel  [516–520] .  This  could  be  at- 
tributed to the high density of biodiesel, increasing the mass ﬂow 
rate  of  the  injected  fuel,  as  discussed  above  [520] .  The  high  CN 
of biodiesel could also cause better combustion, boosting BP [518] . 
The high lubricity of biodiesel could decrease friction loss,  improv- 
ing BP [517] . 

BSFC is deﬁned as the ratio of the fuel mass consumed to the 
BP produced by the engine [521] . In general, there was a unan- 
imous  consensus  in  the  literature  that  biodiesel  could  cause  in- 
creased  BSFC  [ 441 , 510 , 516 , 522–524 ]  because  of  its  high  density, 
high viscosity, and low energetic content [525] . The higher density 
of biodiesel than petrodiesel could increase the fuel injection rate 
for the same plunger displacement of the fuel pump at the same 
pressure [ 526 , 527 ]. Besides, more biodiesel should be introduced 
into the combustion chamber to offset its lower energetic content 
for obtaining the same BP compared with petrodiesel [528] . The 
high  viscosity  of  biodiesel  could  increase  the  fuel  injection  rate 
and deteriorate the atomization of fuel [529] . In turn, these could 
lower BP due to a reduction in combustion eﬃciency [503] . The 
high  BSFC  for  biodiesel  fuel  could  also  be  attributed  to  its  high 
CN, affecting CD [530] . Unlike the reports mentioned above, some 
studies deduced that  biodiesel could lead to  unchanged or even 
decreased BSFC [ 531 , 532 ]. They argued that the fuel-bound oxygen 
of biodiesel could drive the combustion towards completion, hence 
reducing BSFC [531] . 

BSEC  is  deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  the  energy  supplied  to  the 
combustion chamber by the injected fuel to the BP produced by 
the engine [479] . This performance indicator is a more meaning- 
ful  metric  than  BSFC  for  comparing  fuel  blends  having  different 
energetic  contents  [533] .  Overall,  BSEC  was  reportedly  higher  in 
biodiesel than petrodiesel [534–538] . This could be attributed to 
the lower energetic content, higher density, and higher viscosity 
of biodiesel over petrodiesel, as explained earlier [535] . The fuel- 
bound  oxygen  of  biodiesel  could  also  result  in  a  lean  combus- 
tion  process,  increasing  BSEC  [ 539 , 540 ].  However,  some  authors 
claimed  that  using  biodiesel  could  result  in  unchanged  [534]  or 
even reduced BSEC [ 491 , 539–541 ]. They argued that the presence 
of structural oxygen content in biodiesel could enhance the com- 

bustion eﬃciency, which could lower BSEC [491] . Furthermore, the 
higher CN of biodiesel over petrodiesel could improve the combus- 
tion process, resulting in decreased BSEC [541] . 

BTE  indicates  the  capability  of  an  engine  to  transform  the 
chemical  energy  of  the  injected  fuel  into  useful  mechanical 
work [542] . Most of the results published in this area exhibited 
that  biodiesel  and  its  blends  had  lower  BTE  versus  petrodiesel 
[ 541 , 543–546 ]. This reduction could be principally attributed to the 
lower  energetic  content  of  biodiesel  than  petrodiesel  [546] .  The 
low HV of biodiesel could decrease HRR max in the premixed com- 
bustion phase, reducing CHR [545] . The high density, viscosity, and 
surface tension of biodiesel could be rated as the other main rea- 
sons for this reduction [543] . These unfavorable biodiesel physico- 
chemical  attributes  could  negatively  affect  its  spray  characteris- 
tics and fuel drops evaporation, thereby lowering BTE [544] . Unlike 
the researches mentioned above, it was shown in some investiga- 
tions that using biodiesel could cause enhanced BTE [ 516 , 547 , 548 ]. 
The  presence  of  fuel-bound  oxygen  in  biodiesel  could  improve 
its  combustion  eﬃciency  [548] .  The  high  lubricity  of  biodiesel 
could  also  substantially  reduce  friction  losses  [547] .  Accordingly, 
a higher BTE could be obtained for biodiesel in comparison with 
petrodiesel. 

Several  authors  reported  that  the  performance  indices  of  the 
diesel  engines  fueled  with  diesel/biodiesel  or  diesel/biodiesel/ 
oxygenated  additive  blends  could  be  successfully  predicted  by 
the  MLPNN  models  trained  on  engine  operating  parameters 
and  fuel  blend  [ 40 , 97 , 98 , 402–405 , 407 , 408 , 410–418 , 420–422 , 424–
434 , 436 , 455 ].  Furthermore,  the  MLPNN  model  developed  on  en- 
gine operating parameters and fuel blend could successfully pro- 
vide the objective functions required by different evolutionary al- 
gorithms to optimize the diesel engines running on diesel/biodiesel 
blends [ 406 , 409 , 435 ]. In a study conducted by Kumar et al. [437] , 
the  MLPNN  model  trained  on  fuel  type  and  engine  characteris- 
tics could successfully model the BTE and BSFC of the lanthanum 
zirconate  coated-engine  running  on  diesel/Pongamia  Pinnata  oil 
biodiesel blends. 

In  an  interesting  study,  Canakci  et  al.  [440]  successfully  esti- 
mated the BSFC of the diesel-biodiesel engine using the MLPNN 
model  developed  on  the  physico-chemical  characteristics  of  fuel 
blends.  In  continuation,  Canakci  et  al.  [441]  concluded  that 
the  MLPNN  model  trained  on  engine  operating  parameters,  fuel 
physico-chemical  attributes,  and  ambient  conditions  could  pre- 
cisely  estimate  some  performance  indices  of  the  diesel-biodiesel 
engine.  The  MLPNN  model  trained  on  engine  operating  parame- 
ters  and  a  fuel  property  (HV)  by  Gokalp  et  al.  [438]  could  rea- 
sonably  model  some  performance  indicators  of  the  engine  run- 
ning on soybean oil biodiesel blends with jet, marine, and diesel 
fuels.  The  MLPNN  model  developed  on  engine  speed  and  fuel 
physico-chemical properties was much more precise than the LR 
model in predicting the output torque of the engine powered by 
diesel/biodiesel/alcohol blends [439] . In a pioneering study, Menon 
and  Krishnasamy  [41]  strived  to  correlate  the  BTE  and  BSFC  of 
the  light-  and  heavy-duty  diesel  engines  running  on  different 
biodiesels under different load conditions with the FAME proﬁle 
of biodiesel using the MLPNN approach. The results of the trained 
MLPNN models were found to be in good agreement with actual 
data. The developed MLPNN models were then used by the GA and 
TOPSIS methods to optimize the biodiesel composition. TOPSIS is a 
multiple criteria decision making approach that identify solutions 
from a ﬁnite set of alternatives [549] . 

Hosseini  et  al.  [442]  acceptably  predicted  the  torque  and  BP 
of  the  engine  powered  by  diesel/WCO  biodiesel  blends  contain- 
ing  alumina  nanoparticles  using  the  MLPNN  model  developed 
based  on  several  inputs,  including  fuel  properties,  engine  oper- 
ating parameters, and ambient condition. Gharehghani and Pour- 
rahmani  [443]  successfully  simulated  the  BSFC  and  BTE  of  the

engine  powered  by  diesel/biodiesel  emulsion  fuels  doped  with 
cerium  oxide  nanoparticles  using  the  MLPNN  model  trained  on 
biodiesel quantity, water quantity, and nanoparticle concentration. 
The  MLPNN  model  built  on  load  condition  and  fuel  characteris- 
tics by Javed et al. [4 4 4] effectively estimated the BSFC and BTE of 
the dual-fuel diesel-hydrogen engine ignited with diesel/Jatropha 
oil biodiesel blends. Kenano ˘glu et al. [445] successfully predicted 
the  torque  and  BP  of  the  engine  fueled  with  diesel/soybean 
biodiesel  blend  enriched  with  hydroxyl  using  the  MLPNN  model 
developed  based  on  engine  speed,  fuel  type,  and  fuel  ﬂow 
rate. 

Salam and Verma [448] found that some performance parame- 
ters of the engine fueled with diesel/microalgae biodiesel blends 
were  successfully  described  using  the  MLPNN  model  trained  on 
data obtained from the Diesel-RK software package. Notably, the 
Diesel-RK computer program can simulate the full thermodynamic 
cycle  of  internal  combustion  engines  through  the  numerical  so- 
lution of the governing mechanistic partial differential equations. 
Rao and Krishna [456] concluded that performance parameters of 
the  engine  powered  by  diesel/tamanu  oil  biodiesel  blends  could 
be  better  estimated  using  the  FF-MLPNN  model  trained  on  CR 
and fuel composition in comparison with the MLPNN model. Seela 
et  al.  [457]  properly  applied  the  GRNN  model  trained  on  fuel 
composition and load conditions to predict the BSFC and BTE of 
the engine operating on diesel/Mahua oil biodiesel blends doped 
with  zinc  oxide  nanoparticles.  The  estimation  accuracy  of  the 
MLPNN,  RBFNN,  and  LR  models  for  generalizing  the  BSEC  and 
BTE  of  the  engine  powered  by  diesel/WCO  biodiesel  blends  was 
compared  by  Kumar  et  al.  [458] .  The  MLPNN  and  RBFNN  mod- 
els  trained  on  engine  operating  parameters  and  fuel  blend  out- 
performed the LR model in estimating the output responses. Sho- 
jaeefard et al. [419] inferred that both GMDH and MLPNN models 
trained on biodiesel quantity and engine speed could adequately 
estimate the BP and BSFC of the engine fueled with diesel/castor 
oil  biodiesel  blends.  The  GMDH  approach  is  a  self-organizing 
feed-forward neural network used to model and identify complex 
systems [ 550 , 551 ]. 

Aydın  et  al.  [423]  and  Uslu  [453]  deduced  that  the  MLPNN 
model trained on engine operating parameters and fuel blend was 
not accurate as much as the developed RSM model in modeling 
the BTE of the engine running on diesel/biodiesel blends. However, 
Aydın  et  al.  [423]  found  the  MLPNN  model  developed  based  on 
engine operating conditions and fuel composition could precisely 
predict the BSFC of the engine powered by diesel/WCO biodiesel 
blends. Similarly, Esonye et al. [93] observed that the Nelder-Mead 
simplex  developed  based  on  biodiesel  concentration  and  engine 
operating parameter was more accurate than the selected MLPNN 
model in predicting the BTE and BSFC of the diesel-biodiesel en- 
gine. The non-evolutionary Nelder-Mead algorithm is a simplex ap- 
proach to solve non-linear function-approximation problems with- 
out  derivative  equations  [ 552 , 553 ].  The  ANFIS  model  developed 
based on fuel type and engine operating parameters by Hosoz et al. 
[459]  accurately  estimated  some  performance  parameters  of  the 
engine running on diesel/rapeseed oil biodiesel blends. The accu- 
racy of the ANFIS, GA-ANFIS, and PSO-ANFIS approaches trained on 
biodiesel content and engine parameters was comparable in pre- 
dicting the BTE of the engine fueled with diesel/biodiesel blends 
[ 460 , 461 ]. 

Wong et al. [ 99 , 465 ] attempted to model the BSFC of the diesel- 
biodiesel engine using the LSSVM, RBFNN, ELM, and KELM mod- 
els trained on engine parameters and biodiesel quantity. The de- 
veloped  models  were  introduced  into  several  evolutionary  algo- 
rithms,  including  SA,  PSO,  and  CS  methods,  to  ﬁnd  the  optimal 
biodiesel concentration. The ELM and KELM models provided bet- 
ter  prediction accuracy  than  the  other  approaches, while  the  CS 
algorithm outperformed the SA and PSO methods. The suitability 

of the KELM model for estimating some performance parameters 
(BSFC and BTE) of diesel engines was further validated by Silitonga 
et  al.  [ 463 , 464 ],  where  the  diesel  engine  was  fueled  with  vari- 
ous diesel/biodiesel and diesel/biodiesel/bioethanol blends at dif- 
ferent engine operating conditions (engine speed and load condi- 
tion). Ghanbari et al. [466] reported that the multi-gene GP model 
trained on engine speed and nanoparticle concentration adequately 
estimated  some  performance  characteristics  of  the  diesel  engine 
powered by diesel/WCO biodiesel blend doped with multi-wall car- 
bon nanotubes and silver nanoparticles. 

5.3. Exhaust emissions 

The environmental impacts of diesel/biodiesel engines are often 
assessed  using  various  discrete  regulated  and  unregulated  emis- 
sions.  The  regulated  emissions  are  CO,  CO 
2 ,  UHC,  PM,  NO x ,  and 
smoke. The differences in physico-chemical properties of biodiesel 
and petrodiesel have the potential to inﬂuence the exhaust emis- 
sions of diesel engines signiﬁcantly. 

CO  emission  is  directly  associated  with  incomplete  combus- 
tion within the internal combustion engines [554] . The formation 
of  the  heterogeneous  air-fuel  mixture  and  the  shortage  of  oxy- 
gen in the combustion process are the main reasons for CO emis- 
sion [555] . According to the ﬁndings of various investigations, us- 
ing biodiesel in diesel engines could cause decreased CO emission 
[ 516 , 519 , 526 , 555–560 ]. The high local oxygen concentration in the 
biodiesel could play an important role in the reduction of CO emis- 
sion by fully oxidizing more carbon molecules [558] . On the con- 
trary, a few papers reported that biodiesel could increase CO emis- 
sion [ 518 , 561 , 562 ]. They argued that the high viscosity of biodiesel 
could lead to the formation of the nonuniform air-fuel mixture due 
to diﬃculties in its atomization process [518] . 

CO 

2 and CO in diesel engines [531] . CO 

2  emission is a product of the complete combustion of the 
fuel  introduced  into  the  combustion  chamber  [531] .  Generally, 
there  was  an  inverse  association  between  the  concentrations  of 
CO 
2 emission was reported to 
be higher for biodiesel compared with petrodiesel [ 487 , 531 , 563–
565 ]. Indeed, the structural oxygen content of biodiesel could en- 
sure the complete conversion of carbon molecules to CO 
2  [485]. 
The high CN of biodiesel could shorten ID, improving the combus- 
2  emission [563] . In contrast with 
tion process and increasing CO 
the above-listed papers, a limited number of studies observed a re- 
duction in CO 
2 emission in the presence of biodiesel [ 479 , 518 , 566 ]. 
It was argued that this reduction was mainly originated from the 
low C/H ratio of biodiesel [ 479 , 563 ]. 

The  amounts  of  UHC  emissions  formed  within  the  combus- 
tion  chamber  are  directly  attributed  to  the  quality  of  the  com- 
bustion  process  [567] .  These  pollutants  are  generally  generated 
during  the  combustion  process  when  the  air-fuel  mixture  can- 
not  properly  reach  the  ignition  temperature  or  the  injected  fuel 
cannot  fully  oxidize  in  the  oxygen-depleted  environment  [568] . 
Based  on  the  ﬁndings  of  many  scholars,  biodiesel  could  signif- 
icantly  mitigate  UHC  emissions  [ 516 , 561 , 569–573 ].  The  inherent 
oxygen content of biodiesel could provide some favorable effects, 
such as post ﬂame oxidation and higher ﬂame speed in the course 
of air-fuel interactions, in particular in the fuel-rich zones [574] . 
These  could  consequently  promote  the  oxidation  of  UHC  com- 
pounds, lowering their emissions. The high CN of biodiesel could 
also reinforce the combustion process towards completion [572] . 
The  absence  of  aromatic  compounds  in  biodiesel  fuel  could  be 
regarded  as  another  reason  for  this  reduction  [573] .  However,  a 
few research works observed an increase in UHC emissions due to 
biodiesel addition to petrodiesel [ 27 , 363 , 575–577 ]. The high viscos- 
ity of biodiesel could result in the formation of large fuel droplets. 
The injected large drops could not vaporize suﬃciently, leading to 
incomplete combustion [60] . The high density of biodiesel could 

82 

M. Aghbashlo, W. Peng, M. Tabatabaei et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100904 

also  negatively  affect  its  atomization  and  combustion  processes 
[578] .  The  low  energetic  content  of  biodiesel  could  cause  low- 
ered combustion chamber temperature [27] . These all could poten- 
tially allow for a portion of the injected fuel to leave the cylinder 
uncombusted. 

PM is one of the most health-detrimental pollutants in diesel 
exhaust fumes. PM is mainly generated in the fuel-rich regions of 
the combustion chamber under higher temperatures and pressures, 
particularly within the core region of the injected fuel spray [579] . 
Several studies conﬁrmed that biodiesel could decrease PM emis- 
sions  [ 515 , 580–582 ].  The  oxygenated  biodiesel  could  adequately 
provide oxygen to the pyrolysis region of the burning fuel spray, 
leading  to  diminished  PM  emissions  [583] .  In  better  words,  the 
inherent oxygen content of biodiesel could result in a completed 
combustion process, reducing PM formation [580] . Also, the soot- 
ing aﬃnity of aromatics-free biodiesel fuel is lower than that of 
petrodiesel, resulting in decreased PM emissions [584] . This could 
also be attributed to the fact that the high CN of biodiesel could 
shorten ID while prolonging CD [515] . Unlike the arguments elabo- 
rated above, a few investigations recorded higher PM emissions for 
biodiesel versus petrodiesel [ 585 , 586 ]. They tied this observation 
to poor atomization of biodiesel resulted from its higher density 
and viscosity than petrodiesel [585] . 

NO x  emissions  are  the  most  detrimental  elements  emit- 
ted  from  diesel  engines  with  various  health  and  environmen- 
tal  effects  [ 21 , 587 ].  Generally,  diesel  engines  generate  huge  NO x 
emissions  caused  mainly  by  their  high  ﬂame  temperatures  in 
oxygen-  and  nitrogen-rich  environment  [475] .  It  is  generally 
well-documented  that  biodiesel  could  increase  NO x  emissions 
[ 506 , 516 , 518 , 559 , 560 , 577 , 588 , 589 ].  The  structural  oxygen  content 
of  biodiesel  could  propel  the  combustion  process  towards  com- 
pletion,  augmenting  in-cylinder  temperature  [590] .  The  high  CN 
of  biodiesel  could  cause  shorter  ID  and,  accordingly,  could  in- 
crease  the  residual  time  of  air-fuel  mixture  and  primary  com- 
bustion  products  at  higher  temperatures  [591] .  The  oxygenated 
biodiesel could result in less soot formation than petrodiesel, lead- 
ing  to  higher  ﬂame  temperatures  due  to  a  marked  reduction  in 
soot-related radiative heat loss from in-cylinder ﬂame [592] . The 
higher degree of unsaturation of biodiesel fuel could also lead to 
higher ﬂame temperatures [593] . These all could in turn contribute 
to the promotion of NO x formation mechanisms in biodiesel-fueled 
engines. However, it was claimed by some researchers that NO x 
emissions were reduced in the presence of biodiesel. This reduc- 
tion  could  be  related  to  the  lower  EGT  of  diesel  engines  pow- 
ered by biodiesel in comparison with those fueled with petrodiesel 
[519] .  The  slightly  leaner  combustion  of  biodiesel  and,  conse- 
quently, lower cycle temperature could also be mentioned as an- 
other reason for this decrement [363] . 

Smoke is mainly generated in the diffusion combustion phase 
within the fuel-rich regions (particularly inside the core region of 
fuel  spray)  at  elevated  temperatures  and  pressures  [ 594 , 595 ].  In 
general, the smoke opacity of diesel engines fueled with biodiesel 
was  documented  to  be  less  than  those  powered  by  petrodiesel 
due to the inbuilt oxygen content of biodiesel [ 516 , 576 , 588 , 596–
598 ].  Mechanistically,  the  oxygenated  biodiesel  fuel  could  effec- 
tively reduce locally over-rich zones while limiting the formation 
of primary smoke [596] . The low aromatic compounds, C/H ratio, 
and boiling temperature of biodiesel could also reduce its smoke 
opacity [ 576 , 598 ]. However, it was found in a limited number of 
studies  that  biodiesel  could  lead  to  an  increase  in  smoke  emis- 
sions  [ 599 , 600 ].  This  could  occur  since  the  higher  viscosity  of 
biodiesel over petrodiesel could deteriorate the atomization pro- 
cess and could from the locally fuel-rich zones, particularly at part 
load operation conditions [600] . 

Several  authors  found  that  the  MLPNN  models  developed  on 
engine  operating  parameters  and  fuel  composition  were  capable 

of  estimating  the  exhaust  emissions  of  the  diesel  engines  op- 
erating  on  various  diesel/biodiesel  or  diesel/biodiesel/oxygenated 
additive blends [ 97 , 98 , 405 , 407 , 408 , 410–417 , 419–422 , 424–428 , 431–
434 , 436 , 448 , 455 ]. The MLPNN approach was also successfully used 
in  several  studies  to  build  the  objective  functions  required  by 
various evolutionary  algorithms to  ﬁnd optimal operating condi- 
tions/fuel composition for the engines fueled with diesel/biodiesel 
blends  [ 406 , 409 , 435 ].  Kumar  et  al.  [437]  precisely  estimated  the 
UHC, CO, and NO x emissions of the diesel-biodiesel engine coated 
with lanthanum zirconate using the MLPNN model developed on 
engine  characteristics  and  fuel  type.  The  MLPNN  model  devel- 
oped  by  Durán  et  al.  [449]  adequately  estimated  the  mass  frac- 
tion  of  the  soluble  and  insoluble  compounds  of  the  diesel  par- 
ticulates  with  respect  to  engine  operating  conditions  and  fuel 
composition. 

Gokalp et al. [438] successfully predicted the NO x , CO, and CO 
2 
emissions of the engine fueled with jet/biodiesel, marine/biodiesel, 
and diesel/biodiesel blends using the MLPNN model trained on en- 
gine operating parameters and a fuel attribute (HV). Tosun et al. 
[439] compared the capacity of the MLPNN model trained on en- 
gine speed and fuel physico-chemical attributes with the LR model 
in estimating the CO and NO x emissions of the engine powered by 
diesel/biodiesel/alcohol blends. The neural model was much more 
precise than the LR approach in predicting the investigated exhaust 
emissions. Menon and Krishnasamy [41] adequately correlated the 
NO x  and smoke emissions of the light- and heavy-duty biodiesel 
engines with the FAME composition of biodiesel and load condi- 
tions using the MLPNN approach. Canakci et al. [440] observed that 
the MLPNN model developed as a function of the physico-chemical 
properties of fuel blends was reliable for modeling some exhaust 
emissions of the engine powered by diesel/biodiesel blends. In the 
next study, further to physico-chemical attributes of fuel blends, 
engine operating parameters, and environmental conditions were 
also used as input parameters [441] . The MLPNN model that in- 
cluded all the input and output parameters simultaneously showed 
superior performance to the other developed models in estimat- 
ing the exhaust emissions of the engine fueled with diesel/WCO 
biodiesel blends [441] . 

Unlike Uslu [453] , Aydın et al. [423] reported that the MLPNN 
model trained on biodiesel quantity and engine operating parame- 
ters outperformed the RSM model in estimating the UHC, CO, and 
smoke emissions of the engine powered by diesel/biodiesel blends. 
However,  the  RSM  model  was  better  than  the  MLPNN  model  in 
both  investigations  for  modeling  NO x  emissions  [ 423 , 453 ].  Simi- 
larly, Esonye et al. [93] reported that the Nelder-Mead simplex de- 
veloped on engine operating parameters and fuel composition was 
accurate than the MLPNN model in predicting the exhaust emis- 
sions  (CO,  NO x ,  UHC)  of  the  engine  powered  by  diesel/biodiesel 
blends.  Contrary  to  the  studies  mentioned  above,  the  MLPNN 
model trained on engine operating parameters, fuel mass ﬂow rate, 
and fuel type did not well estimate all the studied exhaust emis- 
sions of the engine powered by diesel/biodiesel blends [447] . 

Javed et al. [4 4 4] and Kenano ˘glu et al. [445] claimed that the 
MLPNN models trained on engine operating parameters, fuel com- 
position, and fuel ﬂow rate could accurately estimate the exhaust 
emissions  of  the  engines  powered  by  hydrogen-  and  hydroxyl- 
enriched  diesel/biodiesel  blends.  Gharehghani  and  Pourrahmani 
[443] satisfactorily modeled the exhaust emissions (NO x , UHC, CO) 
of the engine running on diesel/biodiesel emulsion fuels contain- 
ing cerium oxide nanoparticles using the MLPNN model developed 
on biodiesel concentration, water content, and nanoparticle dosage. 
In  a  similar  study,  the  exhaust  emissions  of  the  engine  fueled 
with  alumina  nanoparticles-doped  diesel/biodiesel  blends  were 
precisely estimated using the MLPNN model trained on fuel prop- 
erties, engine operating parameters, and ambient conditions [442] . 
Najaﬁ et  al.  [454]  compared  the  MLPNN,  PSO-MLPNN,  and  GA-

MLPNN models for simulating the exhaust emissions of the dual- 
fuel engine (natural gas as the main fuel) ignited with triacetin- 
doped  diesel/biodiesel  blends.  The  GA-MLPNN  model  trained  on 
the fuel composition, output torque, and fuel ﬂow rate was more 
accurate  than  the  MLPNN  and  PSO-MLPNN  models.  Rao  and  Kr- 
ishna [456] deduced that the FF algorithm could signiﬁcantly im- 
prove the capacity of the MLPNN model trained on CR and fuel 
composition  for  estimating  the  exhaust  emissions  of  the  engine 
powered by diesel/tamanu oil biodiesel blends. 

The accuracy of the GRNN model trained on fuel composition 
and load fraction was acceptable in predicting the exhaust emis- 
sions of the engine powered by diesel/Mahua oil biodiesel blends 
containing zinc oxide nanoparticles [457] . Kumar et al. [458] con- 
cluded  that  both  MLPNN  and  RBFNN  models  developed  on  en- 
gine  operating  parameters  and  fuel  blend  could  outperform  the 
LR model in estimating the exhaust emissions of the engine run- 
ning  on  diesel/WCO  biodiesel  blends.  Wong  et  al.  [ 99 , 465 ]  used 
three  evolutionary  algorithms,  i.e.,  SA,  PSO,  and  CS  approaches, 
to optimize the biodiesel concentration for the engines operating 
on  diesel/biodiesel  blends.  The  required  objective  functions  (for 
UHC, CO, CO 
2 , NO x , PM) were developed using the LSSVM, RBFNN, 
ELM, and KELM approaches based on engine operating parameters 
and  biodiesel  concentration.  The  ELM  and  KELM  models  outper- 
formed  the  other  approaches  in  terms  of  accuracy.  Also,  the  CS 
algorithm  provided  better  optimization  results  over  the  SA  and 
PSO  methods.  Similarly,  Silitonga  et  al.  [ 463 , 464 ]  reported  that 
the  KELM  model  trained  on  fuel  ﬂow  rate/biodiesel  concentra- 
tion and engine speed could precisely predict the exhaust emis- 
sions  of  the  engines  working  on  different  diesel/biodiesel  and 
diesel/biodiesel/bioethanol blends. 

Hosoz et al. [459] satisfactorily used the ANFIS model built on 
fuel type and engine operating parameters to model the exhaust 
emissions of the engine fueled with diesel/rapeseed oil biodiesel 
blends.  Singh  et  al.  [ 460 , 461 ]  found  that  the  exhaust  emissions 
of the engine powered by diesel/jojoba and Kusum blends could 
be precisely estimated using the ANFIS, GA-ANFIS, and PSO-ANFIS 
models developed on fuel composition and engine operating pa- 
rameters.  The  multi-gene  GP  model  developed  on  engine  speed 
and nanoparticle dosage could appropriately estimate the exhaust 
emissions  of  the  engine  running  on  diesel/WCO  biodiesel  blend 
doped with multi-wall carbon nanotubes and silver nanoparticles 
[466] . 

In an interesting study, Mudgal et al. [450] successfully devel- 
oped ﬁve different MLPNN models based on several internal and 
external parameters to estimate the exhaust emissions of the tran- 
sit buses fueled with diesel/biodiesel blends under transient-state 
conditions.  In  continuation,  however,  they  could  not  achieve  ac- 
ceptable accuracy for the investigated emission indices using the 
ANFIS  and  DENFIS  models  trained  on  the  same  input  features 
[462] .  The  DENFIS  approach  is  an  adaptive  intelligent  approach 
where the so-called “evolving cluster method” is used in the learn- 
ing process [601] . Omidvarborna et al. [451] applied the MLPNN 
method to model the NO x  emissions from the EGR and non-EGR 
engines  powered  by  diesel/soybean  biodiesel  blends  under  tran- 
sient conditions. The neural model trained on four and seven dif- 
ferent input parameters for the non-EGR and EGR engines, respec- 
tively, favorably predicted the NO x emissions from the investigated 
engines. In a similar study, Domínguez-Sáez et al. [452] applied the 
MLPNN  and  GA-symbolic  regression  approaches  to  predict  some 
exhaust  emissions  and  PM  characteristics  of  the  engine  operat- 
ing on diesel/animal fat biodiesel blends under transient operat- 
ing conditions. The models were developed based on engine fuel 
composition, operating parameters, and ambient conditions. Even 
though the prediction accuracy of the developed models was com- 
parable, they could not estimate some output parameters with ac- 
ceptable accuracy. 

5.4. Other applications of machine learning technology in modeling 
biodiesel-fueled engines 

In addition to the above-listed documents, some other applica- 
tions of ML-based techniques in modeling various aspects of the 
biodiesel-fueled engines can be found in the published literature. 
Shi et al. [602] successfully correlated effective speciﬁc fuel con- 
sumption  of  the  soybean  biodiesel-fueled  diesel  engine  with  its 
injection  parameters.  Sánchez-Borroto  et  al.  [302]  strived  to  as- 
sociate the ID of palm oil and rapeseed oil biodiesel combusted 
in a six-cylinder turbocharged engine with engine speed, equiva- 
lence ratio, temperature, cetane number, and mean pressure using 
the MLPNN model trained using various algorithms. The MLPNN 
model trained using the BPP algorithm outperformed those opti- 
mized by the CGD, DBD, LM, QN, and QPP methods. Tarabet et al. 
[603]  strived  to  estimate  the  parameters  of  a  dual  Wiebe  func- 
tion (i.e., combustion duration, integrated energy release, and ad- 
justable constants of premixed and diffusion combustion phases) 
for the engine powered by diesel/eucalyptus biodiesel blends using 
the MLPNN approach. The MLPNN model trained on load condi- 
tions and biodiesel concentration could effectively predict the rate 
of heat release during the combustion process. 

Aghbashlo et al. [604] compared the accuracy of the ELM-WT 
(wavelet  transform),  ELM,  GP,  and  MLPNN  to  predict  the  exer- 
getic parameters of the diesel engine powered by diesel/waste oil 
biodiesel blends doped with polymer waste. In continuation, they 
used the SVM approach coupled with the WT, RBF, FF, and quan- 
tum particle swarm optimization techniques for modeling the exer- 
getic indicators of the engine [280] . Overall, the ELM-WT and SVM- 
WT outperformed the other approaches in modeling the exergetic 
indicators of the investigated engine. The population-based quan- 
tum particle swarm optimization approach is an advanced version 
of the PSO algorithm, where the quantum theory is used to boost 
the local capability of  the algorithm in the entire feasible space 
[ 605 , 606 ].  The  WT  approach  is  a  linear  transformation  where  a 
signal is decomposed into components with different scales and 
shifts [607] . Ashok Kumar et al. [404] adequately modeled the ex- 
ergetic eﬃciency of the engine powered by diesel/biodiesel blends 
using the MLPNN model trained on engine parameters. Manieniyan 
et al. [608] compared the predictive power of the RBFNN and PNN 
models for estimating various wear metals in lubricating oil (lead, 
cobalt, magnesium, zinc, copper, iron) of the single-cylinder diesel 
engine operating on diesel/Mahua oil biodiesel. The RBFNN mod- 
els trained on fuel CN, cold EGR ratio, hot EGR ratio, and sampling 
time outperformed the PNN model. 

Redel-Macías et al. [609] compared the prediction accuracy of 
the GA-tuned product-unit ANN, GA-tuned RBFNN, and RSM ap- 
proaches  in  estimating  noise  emissions  from  the  three-cylinder 
diesel  engine  fueled  with  diesel/olive  pomace  oil  biodiesel.  The 
input  parameters  of  the  developed  models  were  power,  engine 
speed, biodiesel quantity, the noise emitted when the engine pow- 
ered  by  baseline  neat  diesel,  and  1/3rd  octave  band  of  the  fre- 
quency. The GA-tuned product-unit ANN model was more accurate 
than the other models, particularly the RSM model. It should be 
noted that multiplicative nodes are used in the product-unit ANN 
model instead of additive ones. Javed et al. [610] reported that the 
MLPNN model trained on biodiesel quantity, nanoparticle size, hy- 
drogen ﬂow rates, and load conditions could adequately estimate 
the noise level of the diesel-hydrogen dual-fuel engine ignited with 
zinc oxide nanoparticle-doped diesel/biodiesel blends. 

Hosseini et al. [442] adequately estimated vibration parameters 
(root  mean  square  of  acceleration  signal  and  Kurtosis  in  three 
axes) of the engine powered by diesel/biodiesel blends doped with 
alumina nanoparticles using the MLPNN model trained on several 
internal and external input variables. In a similar study, horizontal, 
vertical,  and  axial  root  mean  square  of  acceleration  signals  of

Fig. 34.  A schematic representation of the fuzzy adaptive variable weight functional link neural model. In this approach, a nonlinear combination of the input variables is

the need for the hidden layer(s) is resolved. u denotes the initial inputs of the model, v the actual inputs of the neurons, w the connection weights, y the sum of the inputs

the dual-fuel hydrogen-diesel engine ignited with diesel/Jatropha 
biodiesel containing zinc oxide nanoparticles were precisely esti- 
mated using the MLPNN model developed on fuel characteristics 
and load condition [611] . The MLPNN model developed as a func- 
tion of engine speed, hydroxyl ﬂow rate, and fuel properties (CN, 
HV) by Uludamar et al. [612] indicated good performance for the 
prediction of vibration of the engine fueled with diesel/biodiesel 
blends 
(sunﬂower,  canola,  corn  biodiesels)  enriched  by 
hydroxyl. 

Mirnezami et al. [613] used the ANFIS approach to model the 
total weighted vibration of the trailer seat pulled by a two-wheel 
tractor running on diesel/WCO biodiesel fuel blends. Fast Fourier 
transform  algorithm  was  used  to  transform  the  ﬁeld-recorded 
time-domain vibration acceleration signals into the frequency do- 
main.  The  obtained  1/3rd  octave  frequencies  at  different  tractor 
engine  speeds,  tractor  transmission  gear  ratios,  and  fuel  blend 
types were weighted and presented to the ANFIS model. The AN- 
FIS model with the subtractive clustering algorithm accurately es- 
timated the total weighted vibration of the trailer seat. Çelebi et al. 
[614] applied the MLPNN approach to model the noise and vibra- 
tion characteristics of the four-cylinder dual fuel natural gas diesel 
engine  powered  by  diesel/canola  biodiesel  blends.  The  MLPNN 
model  trained  on  engine  speed,  natural  gas  ﬂow  rate,  and  fuel 
properties (density and CN) could provide more accurate predic- 
tions than the developed LR model. 

Kumar  and  Raheman  [615]  precisely  predicted  the  stability 
of Mahua oil biodiesel-water emulsion doped with cerium oxide 
nano-powder using the PSO-RBFNN model developed with ﬁve in- 
puts  (nanoparticle  concentration,  water  content,  surfactant  con- 
tent,  agitation  speed,  holding  time).  In  an  interesting  investiga- 
tion,  Zhang  et  al.  [616]  used  a  fuzzy  adaptive  variable  weight 
functional  link  neural  model  as  a  part  of  a  hybrid  phenomeno- 
logical/soft computing approach to prognosticate endpoint of the 
diesel-biodiesel particulate ﬁlter trapping process. Fig. 34 depicts 
a schematic representation of the fuzzy adaptive variable weight 
functional link neural model. The ash deposition mass predicted 

by the developed neural model was used in the phenomenologi- 
cal model in order to simulate the ﬁlter pressure drop. The cusp 
catastrophe model was then applied to forecast the soot loading 
endpoints for different fuel formulations and initial ash mass. The 
developed  neural  model  accurately  predicted  the  ash  deposition 
mass (with 2.24% average error) compared with the other single 
prediction methods. 

6. Remarks and future directions 

6.1. Biodiesel production 

Converting  natural  oils  into  biodiesel  via  (trans)esteriﬁcation 
process is a very complex process due to involving various tran- 
sient transport phenomena and chemical processes. This process 
becomes more complicated when accelerated with emerging inten- 
siﬁcation technologies. Therefore, simulating, optimizing, and con- 
trolling the biodiesel production process, particularly multiphysics 
(trans)esteriﬁcation reaction using phenomenological and mathe- 
matical  models,  are  not  straightforward  tasks.  ML  technology  as 
an alternative tool for the conventional techniques can effectively 
cope with the high level of uncertainty, complexity, and dynamic- 
ity of the (trans)esteriﬁcation process. 

Based  on  the  published  research  papers  so  far,  modeling  the 
(trans)esteriﬁcation process yield and optimizing the reaction con- 
ditions were the most popular subjects that attracted researchers’ 
attention to apply ML technology in this domain. This could be at- 
tributed to the fact that determining optimum reaction conditions 
is crucial in improving and upscaling the biodiesel production pro- 
cess [204] . However, the economic and environmental aspects of 
the process have not been analyzed in almost all published studies 
and, therefore, there is a noticeable gap in the literature. The num- 
ber of research works dealing with ML applications in modeling 
the  transesteriﬁcation  process  was  signiﬁcantly  higher  than  that 
of the esteriﬁcation reaction. Generally, one-hidden layer MLPNN 
and Takagi-Sugeno ANFIS models were applied in most of the pub- 

85

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100904 

lished  research  for  constructing  the  relationships  between  inde- 
pendent  and  dependent  variables  of  (trans)esteriﬁcation  process. 
Takagi-Sugeno ANFIS modeling system was more accurate than the 
MLPNN approach in modeling and tracking the biodiesel produc- 
tion process. This issue became much more apparent when a lim- 
ited amount of data patterns was used in the training phase. This 
superiority originated from the fact that the ANFIS model beneﬁts 
from the learning capacities of the ANN method and the reasoning 
capabilities of the fuzzy logic approach [210] . 

The ML models used could marginally outperform the classical 
mathematical models such as RSM and MLR models in modeling 
and generalizing the biodiesel content in the (trans)esteriﬁcation 
process  as  the  main  output  variable  considered  in  most  studies 
published in this ﬁeld. Overall, if the goal is to model the process 
yield or biodiesel content, the classical mathematical models are 
preferred to ML techniques because of their reasonable accuracy, 
computational  simplicity,  effective  performance,  and  easy  imple- 
mentation. In other words, ML models might not be a suitable ap- 
proach for the process yield modeling and might not often lead to 
better prediction accuracy in comparison with the standard math- 
ematical methods. However, it should be noted that the ML mod- 
els are superior to physics-based simulations in terms of computa- 
tional performance and can be created for materials of unknown 
physical  properties.  Overall,  there  is  no  further  need  to  demon- 
strate the suitability and reliability of ML techniques for predicting 
the process yield over the conventional mathematical models. 

The ultimate goal of introducing ML technology to the biodiesel 
industry is to monitor and control biodiesel production and reﬁn- 
ing processes in a real-time manner. Despite the huge technolog- 
ical advancement, real-world ML technology implementations for 
monitoring and controlling biodiesel production systems appear to 
be  very  few,  as  tabulated  in  Table  13 .  On  the  contrary,  in  most 
studies, information on biodiesel production has been frequently 
obtained via off-line measurements of fatty acid ester contents of 
samples taken from the (trans)esteriﬁcation reactor [618] . There- 
fore, future studies should be propelled to use ML techniques for 
real-time  monitoring  and  control  of  biodiesel  systems  regarding 
product quality. 

Real-time  monitoring  and  control  of  biodiesel  systems  can 
be  achieved  by  combining  ML  technology  with  advanced  mea- 
surement techniques like electric, magnetic, spectrometric, acous- 
tic,  optical,  electronic,  and  bioelectronics  sensing  methods.  Be- 
sides, micro/nanoelectromechanical systems, as emerging genera- 
tions  of  innovative  smart  particles,  can  be  used  to  obtain  real- 
time  information  about  the  (trans)esteriﬁcation  process.  Despite 
the high accuracy and reliability of these non-destructive and non- 
intrusive measurement techniques, advanced chemometric meth- 
ods are required to preprocess enormous amounts of sophisticated 
singles for the sake of extracting relevant information [619] . No- 
tably, chemometric methods aim to design or choose optimal mea- 

surement conﬁgurations/experimental trials and provide maximum 
meaningful insights from chemical systems by employing various 
data treatment approaches like mathematical, statistical, and ML 
methods [620] . Such models should also be calibrated using the 
relatively few experimental data obtained from off-line analytical 
measurements. Notably, ML-based real-time monitoring and con- 
trol of biodiesel production systems can improve biodiesel quality, 
cut labor and energy costs, lower water and chemical inputs re- 
quirements, enhance the production throughput, and avoid lengthy 
and costly chemical analyses. These all can help render the eco- 
nomic aspects of the biodiesel production process more favorable 
and improve the competitiveness of the biodiesel industry. Fig. 35 
portrays a typical example of such a real-time monitoring and con- 
trol system that can monitor and control the biodiesel production 
process in real-time. 

Even though ML technology is a powerful tool for modeling, op- 
timizing, and controlling the biodiesel production process, it can- 
not be regarded as a perfect universal solution to address all the 
complex chemical system issues. Like any other modeling systems, 
the ML paradigm suffers from several inherent limitations. For ex- 
ample, unlike mechanistic and mathematical models, the structure 
of some ML models, particularly ANN models, cannot be easily in- 
terpreted because they do not provide detailed information about 
the weighting process. The weighting refers to how the strength of 
the connections or synaptic coeﬃcients between different neurons 
of an ANN model is adjusted and calibrated based on training data. 
This is why ANN models are called “black-box” modeling systems. 
A glance at the published papers in this domain manifests that the 
ANN approach has been mostly used as a black-box tool for model- 
ing the biodiesel yield under various process intensiﬁcation meth- 
ods, particularly the mechanical agitation method. In better words, 
overestimating the capacity of this powerful technology might re- 
sult in the loss of its uniqueness. Nevertheless, it is worth noting 
that the combination of modern artiﬁcial intelligence techniques 
can be the key to future knowledge discovery, paving the way for 
uncovering the black-box structure of ANN models. 

The results obtained from most ML models might not be re- 
produced and replicated for a particular application or a similar 
application because of the stochastic nature of weights, biases, and 
other parameters and the nature of the training algorithms. Fur- 
thermore, some ML models, particularly ANN-based models, have 
poor extrapolation capabilities, making these approaches suitable 
only  for  the  conditions  trained  based  on.  This  issue  can  be  sig- 
niﬁcantly solved through combining ANN models or even all ML 
methods with the conservation equations (i.e., continuity, momen- 
tum, energy, and concentration equations) and the second princi- 
ple  of  thermodynamics  (i.e.,  entropy  generation  equation).  How- 
ever, the knowledge about the material properties might negatively 
affect the extrapolation capabilities of such theories. These combi- 
nations, often called “grey-box” or “hybrid” neural models, could

Fig. 35.  A typical ﬂowchart where ML technology is consolidated with advanced instrumentation techniques to monitor and control the biodiesel production process in real- 
time. In this approach, advanced measurement techniques are used to obtain the required information from the production process. The collected data are then introduced 
into various statistical tools to select the most relevant and informative features. After that, the selected features are presented to various fuzzy logic-based approaches to 
model and optimize the process variables. The optimization process is carried out using various knowledge-based and evolutionary-directed techniques. Finally, the process

be regarded as reliable and accurate estimation tools for biodiesel 
production  systems  because  of  their  excellent  interpolation  and 
extrapolation capabilities. These hybrid models are also more in- 
terpretable  than  pure  ANN  models.  Despite  the  unique  features 
of grey-box neural schemes, no study to date has used these ap- 
proaches  in  biodiesel  research  based  on  the  available  literature. 
The  hybrid  neural  model  can  be  developed  in  serial  and  paral- 
lel forms upon the interactions between the neural and the phe- 
nomenological blocks, as shown in Fig. 36 . It is interesting to note 
that ANN technology can be effectively used for facilitating the nu- 
merical solution of complex nonlinear differential equations (phe- 
nomenological approach) frequently faced in the simulation of the 
biodiesel production process. 

For example, a grey-box model can be developed by integrat- 
ing (trans)esteriﬁcation kinetics (phenomenological approach) with 
the  ANN  paradigm.  In  such  a  hybrid  model,  the  kinetics  con- 
stants of the involved reactions in the (trans)esteriﬁcation process 
at  different  process  conditions  can  be  estimated  using  the  ANN 
model trained based on experimental data. The ANN-predicted ki- 
netics constants can then feed to the mathematical rate equations 
to calculate the biodiesel yield. The number of data required for 
such hybrid neural models is lower than those of the conventional 
ANN models. Fig. 37 depicts the typical transesteriﬁcation kinet- 
ics  proﬁles.  Notably,  transesteriﬁcation  kinetics  are  used  to  pro- 
vide information into the fundamental mechanisms of the alcohol- 

ysis reaction of natural oils and fats and determine the time re- 
quired to achieve the desired conversion eﬃciency. However, im- 
plementing  a  purely  phenomenological  approach  to  model  com- 
plex  chemical  processes  like  the  biodiesel  production  process  is 
a time-consuming and computational-intensive task. However, the 
use of the ANN technique requires markedly less effort as com- 
pared with a purely phenomenological approach. ANN-based mod- 
eling approaches also differ from mechanistic models in their ca- 
pability to predict (trans)esteriﬁcation process in the absence of a 
priori information. 

Some of the developed mathematical models in the reviewed 
papers  were  more  accurate  than  the  trained  ANN  models.  This 
could  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the  structure  of  the  devel- 
oped ANN models has not been well selected/optimized because 
of using the export-dependent trial-and-error procedure. This issue 
has been effectively solved in several studies by tuning ANN mod- 
els using evolutionary optimization algorithms [ 194 , 195 , 203 , 205 ]. 
Moreover,  the  topologies  and  weight  matrices  of  the  developed 
ANN models have not been fully reported in the majority of the 
published works, making such studies useless for practical simula- 
tions and design purposes. The most important aspect of an ANN 
model is its weight matrix representing the strength of the connec- 
tions between neurons [623] or simply expressing the mathemat- 
ical interrelations between neurons. The reported weight matrices 
are data-speciﬁc and, therefore, cannot be used for other reaction

situations.  The  suitability  of  some  of  the  developed  ANN  mod- 
els  was  under  question  as  their  associated  statistical  parameters 
were  partially  reported  [ 90 , 147 , 151 , 153 , 164 , 165 , 167–169 ]  or  even 
completely  missed  [ 112 , 146 , 189 , 190 , 206 , 237 ].  Surprisingly,  differ- 
ent statistical criteria were used to compare various models de- 
veloped for a given problem, making more controversial the com- 
parisons conducted [ 197 , 250 , 255 ]. 

Limitted data patterns have been used in various studies in the 
training and testing phases of the developed ML models, particu- 
larly ANN models [ 147 , 173 , 179 , 187 ], resulting in overtraining and 
overﬁtting problems. Accordingly, due to the data-driven charac- 
ter of ANN models, an appropriate number of data patterns should 
be collected and included in their development. These issues could 
also be eﬃciently resolved using k-fold cross-validation, leave-one- 
out cross-validation, and out-of-bootstrap validation methods. Al- 
cohol/oil ratio (molar or volumetric ratio), catalyst quantity, reac- 
tion  temperature,  and  reaction  time  were  the  most  popular  in- 
dependent  variables  considered  in  developing  ML  models.  How- 
ever,  fatty  acid  compositions  of  oil  feedstocks  and  their  impu- 
rity proﬁles (i.e., FFA and water) as the main factors affecting the 
(trans)esteriﬁcation process have never been studied in the pub- 
lished papers. There is still no comprehensive study covering all 
the inﬂuential parameters involved in the (trans)esteriﬁcation re- 
action to model and optimize this process. Moreover, the EN 14214 

standard  on  biodiesel  yield  (i.e.,  ester  content > 96.5%)  has  not 
been satisﬁed in several optimization studies [ 88 , 172 , 179 , 184 , 265 ]. 
Surprisingly,  almost  no  study  has  been  reported  to  date  on  ML 
techniques  for  simulating  and  estimating  the  physico-chemical 
attributes  and  the  amount  of  impurities  of  the  biodiesel  leav- 
ing the production process. Therefore, future work appears mer- 
ited  towards  using  ML  techniques  to  model  and  optimize  the 
(trans)esteriﬁcation process based on the physico-chemical charac- 
teristics and impurity contents of the resultant biodiesel to resolve 
potential problems at an early stage. 

Even  though  static  ANN  approaches  have  been  successfully 
used in most of the published works, dynamic or recurrent ANN 
modeling systems could be more appropriate tools for the time- 
dependent systems like the biodiesel production process as applied 
by  Mjalli  and  Hussain  [206] .  Notably,  dynamic  ANN  models  can 
use the current dependent output(s) in addition to routine inde- 
pendent input(s) to estimate one-step-ahead output(s). In recent 
years, inverse ANN and inverse hybrid neural models have been 
widely applied in many studies for developing ANN-based control- 
ling systems. Accordingly, research should be directed towards in- 
verse ANN and inverse hybrid neural models to monitor and con- 
trol biodiesel production and reﬁning processes. 

The  most  important  quality  indicators  of  biodiesel,  i.e.,  es- 
ter and impurity proﬁles, are often determined by cost-intensive

and off-line methods such as GC-MS, HPLC, and NMR techniques 
[ 292 , 618 ].  However,  it  is  imperative  to  precisely  obtain  these 
quality-related variables of biodiesel in real-time in an industrial 
setting  as  measuring  these  quality  attributes  off-line  might  lead 
to  poor  control  performances  and  large  production  losses.  Fur- 
thermore, the main critical physico-chemical attributes of biodiesel 
should be ensured and certiﬁed by the manufacturing process de- 
sign  based  on  the  Quality  by  Design  concept.  According  to  this 

framework,  sources  of  variations  in  the  (trans)esteriﬁcation  pro- 
cess should be identiﬁed and prevented to improve the quality and 
homogeneity of the resultant biodiesel. These can be achieved us- 
ing real-time monitoring tools with feedback control schemes, as 
shown in Fig. 38 . 

ANN-based  soft-sensors  appear  to  be  powerful  tools  for  the 
biodiesel industry to facilitate process monitoring, control process 
operation, diagnose abnormal situations, and enhance process re-

and scientiﬁc manufacturing practices to enhance the process and product understanding for assuring product quality. There is no longer a need to verify the quality of the 
biodiesel synthesized using the Quality by Design concept since the product is manufactured according to a predeﬁned quality.

liability. A soft-sensor (virtual sensor) is deﬁned as the relation- 
ship  between  a  conventional  sensor(s)  (hardware)  and  a  predic- 
tion algorithm(s) (software) to provide a real-time estimate of a 
hard-to-measure variable(s) [624] . In better words, the essence of 
a soft-sensor is to develop a predictive mathematical model(s) be- 
tween an immeasurable target variable(s) like ester content and an 
available measurement(s) like viscosity and density. In this context, 
the promising results for checking the reaction progress and mon- 
itoring the biodiesel production rate have been reported by Gar- 
cía et al. [275] and Torrisi and Sabino [276] using the ANN-based 
soft-sensors developed on viscosity measurements. However, more 
studies should be aimed at applying ANN-based soft-sensors for 
real-time monitoring and control of biodiesel production systems. 
Fig. 39 indicates a typical schematic of ANN-based soft-sensor that 
can be applied for real-time monitoring and control of biodiesel 
production. 

6.2. Biodiesel properties 

Measuring the physico-chemical properties of biodiesel and its 
impurities content using the current established experimental pro- 
cedures is a costly and lengthy task. Therefore, developing accu- 
rate models and computational approaches to derive these insights 
from the structural features of biodiesel or simple indirect mea- 
surement methods is an increasingly important task for the scien- 
tiﬁc community. However, the relationships between the physico- 
chemical properties of biodiesel and its structural features/simply 
measured properties are highly nonlinear and extremely complex. 
ML technology is a robust modeling tool that enables researchers 
to  construct  such  ill-deﬁned  relationships  between  input-output 
variables.  Hence,  ML  technology  has  popularized  rapidly  during 
the  past  two  decades  due  to  its  capability  to  accurately  predict 
biodiesel properties and reliably quantify its impurities from small 
datasets. 

A glance at the recent scientiﬁc literature shows that estimating 
density, cetane number, and viscosity of biodiesel fuel using ML 
techniques was the most popular topic addressed in most of the 
published literature. It should be noted that measuring/modeling 
biodiesel  density  for  samples  stratifying  all  the  other  speciﬁed 
items  is  superﬂuous  since  their  density  will  undoubtedly  be  in 
the prescribed ranges of international norms [38] . In addition, it 

is also well-documented that biodiesel density does not vary sig- 
niﬁcantly due to the proximity of the density of oil and alcohol 
to  that  of  the  synthesized  biodiesel  [38] .  In  several  studies,  the 
density and viscosity of pure biodiesel and diesel/biodiesel blends 
have  been  modeled  as  a  function  of  temperature  or  even  pres- 
sure  [ 305 , 311 , 312 , 321 ].  If  the  goal  was  to  check  the  compliance 
of these properties with the established standards, there was no 
need to evaluate the density and viscosity of biodiesel fuel at dif- 
ferent temperatures and pressures. This could be attributed to the 
fact that the density and viscosity of biodiesel fuel should be mea- 
sured at a constant temperature at atmospheric pressure accord- 
ing to the established norms. On the contrary, if such studies were 
aimed at modeling the density and viscosity of biodiesel just be- 
fore injection, these data could not provide relevant information as 
the investigated temperature and pressure ranges were very low 
than those that actually occur in diesel engines. In conclusion, the 
ranges  of  temperature  and  pressure  should  be  selected  close  to 
real-world conditions. 

MLPNN  and  Takagi-Sugeno  ANFIS  approaches,  as  the  most 
widely used modeling systems, could reliably estimate the physico- 
chemical properties of biodiesel compared with the classical math- 
ematical and theoretical models. The models developed based on 
the  FAME/FAEE  proﬁle  of  biodiesel  could  statistically  outperform 
those  trained  on  its  other  structural  features  [305] .  However,  a 
limited  number  of  FAME/FAEE  species  have  been  used  in  most 
developed  models  [ 293 , 303 , 304 , 307 , 323 ],  rendering  such  models 
ineffective  and  inaccurate  in  practice  for  predicting  the  physico- 
chemical properties of all biodiesel samples. In conclusion, the size 
and  relevancy  of  input  descriptors,  i.e.,  FAME  proﬁle  or  chemi- 
cal structure markedly affecting the reliability and accuracy of ML 
techniques, should be carefully assessed. Therefore, future research 
should include more fatty acid ester compounds or more relevant 
structural features in the training process to provide a ubiquitous 
and pervasive model. Many input variables have been used in some 
published  works  for  estimating  the  physico-chemical  properties 
of  biodiesel,  while  their  dimensionality,  redundancy,  irrelevancy, 
and  collinearity  have  never  been  investigated  before  [ 309 , 327 ]. 
This could prolong the computational time required for develop- 
ing proper ML models, affect their prediction accuracy and com- 
plicate their mathematical structures. These issues could be effec- 
tively addressed using various “input variable selection” techniques 

90

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100904 

like PCA, PLS, and PCR approaches through removing the superﬂu- 
ous variables and outliers. 

The  topology  and  training  parameters  of  the  most  developed 
ML models have been optimized/selected using the conventional 
trial-and-error procedure [ 293 , 294 ]. The problems associated with 
this operator-dependent computational-intensive process could be 
resolved  using  advanced  stochastic  metaheuristics  like  GA,  PSO, 
and ACO [ 298 , 307 , 317 ]. It is worth noting that ML techniques are 
usually  combined  with  evolutionary  algorithms  in  two  ways.  In 
the ﬁrst method, the models or objective functions developed by 
ML techniques are presented to evolutionary algorithms aimed at 
optimizing  the  process  variables  (like  the  MLPNN-GA  approach). 
In the second method, evolutionary algorithms are used to opti- 
mize/tune the variables of ML models amid at improving the pre- 
diction accuracy (like the GA-MLPNN approach). These evolution- 
ary computation techniques are also capable of attaining the global 
optimum point without getting trapped in local optima. The math- 
ematical structures and speciﬁcations of the most developed ML 
models have not been reported, making them unsuitable for use 
in future applications. Accordingly, architecture and speciﬁcations 
of ML models being developed in future research work should be 
fully reported in order to make their use more and more eﬃcient. 
This problem could also be better solved by embedding the mathe- 
matical structures of the developed ML models in simple computer 
programs as done by Hosseinpour et al. [22] . 

As the most widely used ML techniques, the ANN approach has 
been mostly applied as a black-box modeling system for estimating 
the  physico-chemical  properties  of  biodiesel.  Although  this  issue 
could be slightly addressed using the ANFIS approach, the model is 
not still fully transparent due to its neural part. This problem could 
be further resolved through hybridizing neural models with mech- 
anistic approaches, as discussed above. Despite the superiority of 
the ANFIS approach over other ANN models, an individual Takagi- 
Sugeno ANFIS model was designed for each output in almost all 
studies. This issue could be relieved using multi-input multi-output 
ANFIS architecture. Some of the ANN models reported in the pub- 
lished literature have been developed based on limited data pat- 
terns [ 293 , 307 , 309 , 323 ]. The overtraining and overﬁtting problems 
associated with such neural models could be effectively addressed 
using several methods explained in the previous section. The accu- 
racy of some of the developed regression models was comparable 
or even better than that of the trained ANN models. This might be 
attributed to the fact that the structure and training parameters of 
the developed ANN models have not been well optimized/selected. 
Despite  the  crucial  importance  of  impurities  in  biodiesel  fuel 
and their substantial effects on its physico-chemical and combus- 
tion characteristics, there has been no published work concerning 
the use of ML technology for detecting and quantifying biodiesel 
impurities.  This  shortcoming  could  be  effectively  rectiﬁed  using 
advanced measurement techniques like near-infrared/Raman spec- 
troscopy, optical imaging, acoustic, microwave resonance, electrical 
capacitance tomography, and electronic nose/tongue techniques in- 
tegrated with ML technology for pattern recognition and process 
modeling. Furthermore, the results reported in most studies were 
case-speciﬁc and, accordingly, such ﬁndings could not be consis- 
tently replicated and effectively used in future applications. For ex- 
ample, the physico-chemical properties of diesel/biodiesel blends 
were  measured  and  modeled  without  including  their  structural 
features in modeling systems [ 313 , 320 , 321 , 326 ], rendering the de- 
veloped model incapable of estimating the fuel blends with differ- 
ent compositions. 

The  majority  of  the  studies  conducted  in  this  area  aimed  to 
demonstrate the robustness of ML technology as an alternative tool 
for estimating the physico-chemical attributes of biodiesel fuel. ML 
technology has been rarely used in real-world conditions for mon- 
itoring biodiesel fuel quality, which is the primary goal of ML in- 

troduction to this domain. This opens the scope for more research 
in the area of quality monitoring in biodiesel production and dis- 
tribution  processes.  Therefore,  ML  technology  can  be  a  potential 
future technology for real-time monitoring of biodiesel fuel quality 
within the production process. 

ML technology can also be effectively applied to ﬁnd suitable 
biodiesel feedstocks complying with the requirements of the es- 
tablished standards as the transesteriﬁcation process does not al- 
ter their fatty acid ester proﬁle [38] . This unique tool can allow 
engineers to engineer the fatty acid proﬁle of potential biodiesel 
feedstocks for optimizing their prospect fuel characteristics [625] . 
Furthermore, it is challenging to ﬁnd out a proper biodiesel com- 
position fully complying with all the requirements in terms of bet- 
ter handling, injection, atomization, vaporization, fuel-air mixing, 
ignition,  combustion,  lubrication,  pollutant  formation,  cold  ﬂow 
properties,  and  oxidative  stability  characteristics  [344] .  ML  tech- 
nology can potentially help solve this issue by introducing suitable 
biodiesel  mixtures  without  conducting  cost-intensive  and  time- 
consuming experimental trials. Another potential application of ML 
technology would be to detect diesel-biodiesel blend adulteration 
using  the  signals  obtained  from  non-destructive  testing  meth- 
ods. Overall, the use of ML technology in modeling the physico- 
chemical properties of biodiesel has just emerged, and it is envis- 
aged to play a more prominent role in the future. 

6.3. Engines fueled with biodiesel 

The combustion process of biodiesel fuel within diesel engines 
is  a  very  complicated  phenomenon  because  of  involving  many 
synergistically processes taking place concurrently [626] . This can 
also  be  attributed  to  the  great  diversity  in  ester  compounds  of 
biodiesel fuels resulting from large variations in their parent feed- 
stocks’  fatty  acid  proﬁles  [41] .  The  inherent  heterogeneity  and 
nonuniformity  of  biodiesel  fuels  can  lead  to  large  variations  in 
fuel combustion-relevant attributes. Accordingly, costly and lengthy 
combustion  tests  should  be  performed  to  evaluate  their  impacts 
on  the  performance,  combustion,  and  emission  characteristics  of 
biodiesel-fueled engines. The cost and time associated with exper- 
imental calibration and behavior mapping of biodiesel-fueled en- 
gines can be dramatically reduced by harnessing the predictive ca- 
pability of various modeling approaches. However, such complex 
combustion systems do not lend themselves easily to conventional 
modeling techniques. Luckily, ML technology can afford rapid de- 
velopment of the nonlinear relationships between the inputs and 
outputs of ill-deﬁned biodiesel-fueled engines based on a reason- 
able amount of experimental data without earlier knowledge. 

The  MLPNN  approach  was  the  most  widely  used  ML  tech- 
nology for describing biodiesel-fueled engines’ behavior, followed 
far  behind  by  the  ANFIS  and  ELM  approaches.  Despite  the  in- 
herent complexity of biodiesel-fueled engines, all these modeling 
systems  could  precisely  estimate  their  performance,  combustion, 
and emission parameters. The most prevalent input variables used 
in  modeling  biodiesel  engines  were  engine  speed,  engine  load, 
compression  ratio,  injection  pressure,  injection  timing,  and  fuel 
type. The majority of the studies conducted in this domain were 
mainly focused on using the MLPNN approach to model and op- 
timize well-known performance (torque, BP, BTE, BSFC, EGT) and 
regulated emission (CO 
2 , CO, UHC, NO x ) parameters of biodiesel- 
fueled  engines.  This  could  be  ascribed  to  the  fact  that  the  cur- 
rent tight emission legislation targets have spurred growing inter- 
est in improving fuel economy and mitigating pollutant emissions 
of biodiesel engines. 

The  combustion  characteristics  of  biodiesel  engines  have  not 
been studied adequately using ML methods because of the need 
for installing additional instruments and devices within the com- 
bustion chamber. In addition, different aspects of PM and smoke 

91 

M. Aghbashlo, W. Peng, M. Tabatabaei et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100904 

emissions  were  modeled  using  ML  technology  in  the  published 
studies, rendering diﬃcult comparisons among different investiga- 
tions. For example, PM level [ 409 , 419 , 454 , 462 ], soluble and insolu- 
ble fraction of PM [449] , PM 
10 [450] , smoke [ 406 , 410 , 412 , 414 , 417 ], 
dry soot [407] , smoke opacity [ 408 , 415 , 463 ], Hartridge smoke unit 
[ 421 , 448 ], and smoke density [422] were modeled by various re- 
searchers  using  ML-based  models.  ML  modeling  of  unregulated 
emissions (i.e., acetone, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, alkenes, aro- 
matics, and so on) of biodiesel engines has never been conducted 
in  the  published  works  and,  accordingly,  there  is  room  for  fur- 
ther research. It should be noted that the unregulated emissions 
of diesel engines have a higher negative impact on human health 
than the regulated emissions. 

There were no comprehensive studies covering all the inﬂuen- 
tial independent factors affecting the behavior of biodiesel-fueled 
engines because of limitations in time and resources. One of the 
main  drawbacks  of  biodiesel-fueled  engines  is  their  higher  NO x 
emissions levels than the diesel-fueled engine. In several studies 
[ 407 , 426 , 432 , 4 42 , 4 47 ],  only  NO  emission  was  measured  and  in- 
cluded in the  developed ML models.  This is a serious  limitation 
since NO emission is only a portion of the total NO x formed dur- 
ing the combustion process. Several ML models reported in the lit- 
erature were trained and tested based on a limited amount of data 
[ 93 , 411 , 420 , 430–432 , 437 , 439–441 , 449 , 453 , 455–457 ], thereby mak- 
ing  the  obtained  results  doubtful  and  unreliable.  Indeed,  those 
models might return poor results for unseen/unexploited data be- 
cause of data-driven character ML-based models [627] . Due to a 
small amount of data in some studies, the traditional approaches 
like  RSM  [453]  and  Nelder-Mead  simplex  [93]  could  outperform 
the developed ML models. 

Several seemingly combustion-irrelevant input parameters like 
ambient air relative humidity and ambient pressure were consid- 
ered  independent  input  variables  in  ML  modeling  of  biodiesel- 
fueled engines under steady-state conditions [ 4 41 , 4 42 ]. Indeed, too 
many input variables not only might lead to an inferior reﬂection 
of the nature of the process but also might result in reduced ap- 
plication  and  value  of  the  resultant  model  [628] .  Canakci  et  al. 
[441] attempted to address this issue by considering various per- 
mutations  and  combinations  of  input  variables  and  carrying  out 
multiple trial calculations. This methodology could not always lead 
to the optimized ML models and could undoubtedly prolong the 
computation time. Accordingly, it is of great importance to adopt a 
reliable method for selecting independent and relevant variables. 

In  several  works,  in  addition  to  the  independent  input  vari- 
ables,  some  engine-out  dependent  responses  like  fuel  consump- 
tion  rate  [ 4 42 , 4 45 , 4 47 , 452 , 454 , 463 ],  output  power  [417] ,  torque 
[ 99 , 404 , 4 47 , 4 49 , 454 , 465 ], oxygen emission [442] , and exhaust gas 
temperature  [442]  were  irrationally  introduced  into  the  devel- 
oped  ML  models  as  input  parameters.  This  could  result  in  high 
collinearity between the input variables, dramatically complicating 
the modeling process and negatively affecting the applicability of 
the developed model. Accordingly, in such cases, the collinearity 
between input variables should be checked and treated using var- 
ious statistical and ML tools. Furthermore, in some studies, all the 
mass fractions of the constituents of the prepared fuel blends de- 
rived from mass balance calculations were taken into account as 
input variables [ 97 , 425 , 457 ]. The intended input variables were not 
independent since the mass fraction of a given compound could be 
obtained by subtracting unity from the total mass fraction of other 
fuel constituents. In general, if there are N compounds in an given 
fuel blend, the mass fractions of N -1 compounds should be intro- 
duced into ML models in order to eliminate the potential collinear- 
ity between the input variables. 

Several authors developed individual ANN models for each sin- 
gle output parameter [ 40 , 41 , 97 , 410 , 412 , 417 , 427 , 436 , 450 ]. According 
to the statistical parameters reported in these studies, the devel- 

oped single-output ANN models were only slightly better than the 
neural  models  trained  to  simultaneously  estimate  all  output  re- 
sponses  (multiple-output  ANN  models).  One  of  the  main  advan- 
tageous features of the ANN approach compared with the conven- 
tional statistical models, i.e., accommodating all inputs to estimate 
all outputs simultaneously, has been sacriﬁced to a trivial improve- 
ment in the prediction accuracy. Such a strategy could result in a 
complicated model development process and prolonged computa- 
tion time. The traditional operator-speciﬁc and time-intensive trial- 
and-error procedure was usually used to tune the structure and 
training parameters of the developed ML models in this domain. 
This issue could be effectively addressed using evolutionary meta- 
heuristics like GA, PSO, and FF techniques [452,456,460,461] .

The  statistical  parameters  associated  with  the  devel- 
oped  ML  models  have  been  partially  reported  [ 40 , 402–
404 , 411 , 413 , 422 , 4 42 , 4 43 , 4 47 ] 
missed 
[ 4 45 , 4 49 , 455 , 457 ],  making  decisions  about  their  validity  and 
reliability  controversial.  In  addition,  some  of  the  reported  ML 
models  were  very  vague  [ 422 , 455 , 456 ]  in  terms  of  data  used 
in  the  model  development,  parameters  used  in  the  developed 
models,  and  statistical  criteria  used  in  the  model  evaluation. 
The absence of model speciﬁcations and mathematical structures 
would  further  limit  the  potential  applications  of  the  majority  of 
the ML models trained for mapping input-output relationships of 
biodiesel engines. Therefore, to extend the potential applications 
of  future  ML  models,  their  mathematical  structures  should  be 
thoroughly reported. 

The  ester  content  of  some  of  the  biodiesel  fuels  used  in  the 
combustion experiments was lower than 96.5%, overlooking the EN 
14214  standard  on  biodiesel  quantity  [ 422 , 425 ].  It  is  worth  not- 
ing that fueling diesel engines with biodiesel fuels having a high 
amount of impurities could signiﬁcantly deteriorate their perfor- 
mance,  combustion,  and  emission  characteristics  even  in  short- 
term measurements. This could negatively affect the reliability and 
repeatability  of  the  experimental  combustion  data  collected  and 
used in ML modeling. Furthermore, almost all the papers published 
in this domain have dealt with modeling the performance, com- 
bustion,  and  emission  parameters  of  diesel  engines  powered  by 
methyl esters of various feedstocks. ML modeling of diesel engines’ 
behavior fueled with ethyl esters has been rarely reported in the 
published literature so far [434] . 

In  various  studies,  a  non-quantitative  parameter,  i.e.,  fuel 
type  was  introduced  to  the  developed  ML  models  as  an 
input  parameter  [ 40 , 98 , 405 , 408 , 410 , 412–414 , 416–418 , 420 , 422 , 427–
431 , 434 , 435 , 437 , 4 45–4 47 , 458 , 459 ].  This  would  reduce  the  poten- 
tial application of such models to other fuel blend types or even 
fuel blends with the same compositions but different blending ra- 
tios. In conclusion, ML models should be trained on quantitative 
inputs  to  make  them  more  applicable  in  future  usage.  In  addi- 
tion,  Salam  and  Verma  [448]  used  the  simulation  data  obtained 
from the Diesel-RK software package to model the engine behav- 
ior, violating the basic principles of ANN-based approaches. Indeed, 
these data-driven ML techniques have been developed to unravel 
inherent uncertainty and ambiguity characteristics in a real-world 
problem. Accordingly, ML-based approaches should be developed 
on the data obtained from experimental measurements, not from 
commercial software packages. 

The majority of the data used in developing ML models were 
compiled under steady-state engine operating conditions. However, 
only a few studies were used the pollutant emission data collected 
under transient conditions to train the developed ML models [ 450–
452 , 462 ]. Some of the designed predictive ML models could not 
correctly estimate the desired output parameters, probably due to 
the  low  repeatability  of  the  data  collected  under  unsteady-state 
conditions. Numerous factors are affecting diesel engine behavior 
under transient conditions. Therefore, the redundant and uninfor- 

92

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100904 

mative  variables  should  be  removed  from  the  input  parameters 
through advanced variable selection techniques. This can facilitate 
the training process, simplify the model structure, and shorten the 
required computational time. Overall, future studies should focus 
on using the data compiled under transient conditions to enhance 
the applicability of ML models to real-world situations. Dynamic 
or recurrent ANN models are also highly recommended to improve 
the prediction accuracy of ML-based models under transient con- 
ditions. 

The diesel engines used in almost all the published studies to 
gather the data required for developing ML models were assumed 
to  be  stable.  However,  using  biodiesel  in  neat  or  blended  form 
could negatively affect the combustion stability of diesel engines 
[629] . Accordingly, cyclic variations of biodiesel-fueled engines that 
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence their behavior should be investigated using 
ML-based approaches in future studies. The main reasons for the 
cyclic variations in the combustion phenomenon are the variations 
in the fuel spray movement within the combustion chamber, the 
ﬂuctuations in the quantities of air and fuel introduced into the 
engine, and the variabilities in the heterogeneity of fresh air-fuel 
mixture and remaining gases within the combustion chamber each 
cycle [629] . Furthermore, there is no study available using ML tech- 
nology for simulating the performance, combustion, and emission 

parameters of biodiesel engines under durability testing so far and, 
therefore, there is an important gap in the literature. 

Most of the published works in this domain were case-speciﬁc 
and  could  not  be  extended  to  other  engine  types,  fuel  formu- 
lations,  and  environmental  conditions.  In  better  words,  the  ML 
model developed for a given biodiesel engine powered by known 
fuel blends under speciﬁed engine operating conditions and envi- 
ronmental factors could not be applied for another biodiesel en- 
gine without renewing the learning process. Indeed, the appeal- 
ing terms  “Artiﬁcial Neural  Network”,  “Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy  In- 
ference System”, and “Extreme Learning Machine” might pave the 
way for misusing ML technology in this research domain. To cope 
with  this  issue,  some  authors  strived  to  develop  a  generic  ML 
model to predict the performance, combustion, and emission pa- 
rameters of biodiesel engines based on the physico-chemical at- 
tributes of fuel blends [438–442] and FAME proﬁles of biodiesel 
samples [ 41 , 449 ]. Despite the promising results obtained through 
the  above-listed  preliminary  studies,  the  reported  models  could 
not  be  directly  used  in  real-world  conditions.  Further  research 
should be directed toward developing such generic ML-based mod- 
els  for generalizing the  behavior of  biodiesel-fueled engines.  For 
example, using biodiesel molecular structure (molecular and func- 
tional group count descriptors) and non-dimensionalizing engine 

Fig. 40.  A typical ﬂowchart can be used to monitor and control the biodiesel blending ratio in a biodiesel-fueled engine under transient-state conditions in real-time. 
In this approach, the required information, including engine parameters (combustion parameters, performance indices, and exhaust emissions), biodiesel physico-chemical 
properties, and environmental conditions, are collected using various measurement techniques. The gathered data are presented to various statistical tools to select relevant 
information. The modeling and optimization processes are then carried out using various artiﬁcial intelligence techniques to ﬁnd the optimal biodiesel blending ratio. Finally, 
the control system adjusts the biodiesel blending ratio based on the optimized value.

operating parameters can effectively pave the way for developing 
reliable generic ML models and precisely characterize biodiesel en- 
gines  without  reliance  on  a  large  amount  of  experimental  data. 
However, cautions should be made in the selection of independent 
and informative input variables in order to simplify the modeling 
process and enhance the ﬁdelity of the resultant models. 

Various energy-based performance indices, including BP, BSFC, 
and BTE, have been used in ML modeling biodiesel-fueled engines. 
However, these indicators are not ideal for evaluating biodiesel en- 
gines’ performance because they only consider the energy quan- 
tity while disregarding its quality [4] . This issue can be effectively 
addressed using the exergy concept. In this context, some authors 
were used exergetic indicators of biodiesel engines to model their 
performance using ML technology [ 280 , 404 , 604 ]. Despite the supe- 
riority of exergy analysis over energy analysis, the exergy concept 
disregards  some  crucial  aspects  of  thermodynamic  systems  like 
economic and environmental considerations. Exergoeconomic and 
exergoenvironmental  approaches  can  effectively  tackle  this  criti- 
cal  issue  by  consolidating  the  exergy  principles  with  economic 
and  environmental  factors  [ 630 , 631 ].  Accordingly,  future  studies 
should be directed towards using exergoeconomic and exergoenvi- 
ronmental indicators in ML modeling and subsequent optimization 
of biodiesel engines. 

To date, ML technology has been used to model discrete emis- 
sion  indicators  (i.e.,  regulated  emissions)  of  biodiesel-fueled  en- 
gines.  Although  invaluable  insights  could  be  obtained  using  dis- 
crete emissions analysis concerning the environmental impacts of 
biodiesel-fueled engines, it would be arbitrary and potentially un- 
fair to  make  decisions on  such  a  basis.  This could  be  attributed 
to the fact that various biodiesel fuels might differently inﬂuence 
the regulated and unregulated emissions proﬁles of diesel engines 
[ 281 , 632 ].  More  importantly,  the  background  environmental  im- 
pacts  of  the  biodiesel  production  process  are  overlooked  in  dis- 
crete emission analysis [633] . The life cycle assessment approach 
can effectively deal with these issues by converting multiple dis- 
crete emission parameters to a single comprehensive output [633] . 
This environmental assessment methodology can also reduce train- 
ing diﬃculty, simpliﬁed ML model architecture, compacted mathe- 
matical structure, and shortened computation time. 

The use of hybrid ML models is highly recommended to cope 
with the poor extrapolation capability and to deal with the low 
degree of transparency of some ML models. Besides, there is a gap 
in the literature as ML technology has never been used to mon- 
itor and control the behavior of biodiesel-fueled engines. Accord- 
ingly, future work should include using the ML approach for real- 
time control of biodiesel fueled engines with respect to their per- 
formance, combustion, and emission characteristics. For example, 
ﬁnding the optimal blending ratio of petrodiesel and biodiesel to 
achieve  the  highest  fuel  economy  and  the  lowest  exhaust  emis- 
sions under real-world conditions is a very challenging issue. ML 
technology can aid researchers in real-time monitoring and con- 
trol of biodiesel blending ratio for biodiesel-fueled engines under 
transient-state conditions, as presented in Fig. 40 . 

7. Practical and policy implications of the present review 

Based on the papers reviewed in this study, the following prac- 
tical implications should be considered to ensure the right and ef- 
ﬁcient use of ML technology in biodiesel research: 

- Biodiesel systems cannot easily lend themselves to conventional 
modeling, optimization, and controlling techniques because of 
their uncertainty, complexity, and dynamicity originated from 
the varying nature of biodiesel feedstocks. As a promising alter- 
native to the conventional modeling approaches, ML technology 
can greatly resolve the challenges faced by the biodiesel sys- 
tems. 

- There  was  no  clear  basis  for  choosing  and  characterizing  ML 
models in biodiesel research. Generally, authors were found in- 
terested in using the newly developed approaches to improve 
the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  their  results.  In  better  words, 
simple MLPNN models were mostly used in the earlier articles 
published in this domain, while advanced ML models have been 
used since their introduction in recent years. Different aspects 
of the ML techniques used in biodiesel research are tabulated in 
Table 14 . The information provided in this table will undoubt- 
edly lead to the proper use of ML techniques in biodiesel re- 
search. 

- Given that most of the works published in this research domain 
were case-speciﬁc with limited applicability to a wide range of 
conditions, future research is merited towards exploring a way 
for developing and implementing generic ML-based models ap- 
plicable across real-world cases. 

- Having considered the traditional subjective and tedious trial- 
and-error approach was the most widely practiced method in 
this  discipline  for  optimizing  and  tuning  the  structure  of  ML 
models, coupling eﬃcient/robust evolutionary paradigms with 
ML-based models to achieve better prediction accuracy appears 
to be a must in future studies. 

- Although many studies have been devoted to using ML tech- 
nology  as  a  function  approximator  in  lab-scale  biodiesel  sys- 
tems, there is little progress in taking advantage of this unique 
technique  for  real-time  monitoring  and  control  of  real-world 
biodiesel systems. Notably, real-time monitoring and control of 
biodiesel  systems  using  ML-based  models  can  improve  their 
economic  features  by  enhancing  the  quality  and  quantity  of 
biodiesel production, bypassing the costly and lengthy certiﬁca- 
tion process of biodiesel fuel, and optimizing fuel consumption 
rate and settings in biodiesel engines. 

- Bearing in mind that most ML models, particularly the ANN- 
based approaches, have been considered as black-box models in 
almost all the works reported in this ﬁeld so far, grey-box mod- 
els (consolidation of phenomenological and ML models) having 
both good interpolation and extrapolation capabilities need to 
be further researched and exploited in future works. 

- Considering that some of the published ML models were devel- 
oped on an insuﬃcient amount of data patterns, the quantity 
of data presented to data-driven ML models should be system- 
atically determined to obtain reliable and meaningful results. 
- Keeping in mind that some of the reported ML models were 
developed based on irrelevant and dependent input variables, 
the dimensionality and collinearity of input variables should be 
carefully reduced using appropriate techniques for the sake of 
reliable results. 

- Given  the  fact  that  the  conventional chemical  analysis  meth- 
ods like GC-MS, LC-MS, and HPLC-MS are very cost-intensive 
and time-consuming with limited applicability to real-time ap- 
plications, developing ML-based soft sensors based on simply- 
measured  parameters  is  of  crucial  importance  for  real-time 
monitoring and control of biodiesel systems.

8. Conclusions 

This paper is devoted to comprehensively reviewing and crit- 
ically  discussing  applications  of  ML  technology  in  biodiesel  re- 
search.  The  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  this  powerful  tool 
in modeling, optimizing, monitoring, and controlling biodiesel sys- 
tems are systematically outlined and scrutinized. Overall, the in- 
terest  in  the  use  of  the  ML  approach  in  biodiesel  systems  is 
growing  due  to  the  need  for  high-quality  biodiesel,  discounting 
labor  and  energy  costs,  reducing  water  and  chemical  consump- 
tion,  automating  biodiesel  plants,  examining  biodiesel  suitability 
for  engine  application,  checking  biodiesel  compliance  with  the 
established  standards,  calibrating  diesel  engines  with  biodiesel- 
containing  fuel  blends,  and  ﬁnding  optimal  engine  settings.  Ac- 
cording to the published literature, ML technology has been exten- 
sively used for modeling lab-scale biodiesel systems. However, ML- 
based techniques have never been employed for real-time moni- 
toring and control of real-world biodiesel systems. Therefore, the 
adequacy of ML schemes, even advanced deep learning methods, 
for straightforward modeling of future lab-scale biodiesel systems 
is well proven, and no further investigation into that seems nec- 
essary.  Instead,  research efforts need to  be directed  towards the 
use of ML technology for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing 
industrial biodiesel systems in real-time. The developed ML-based 
monitoring  and  control  systems  should  ﬁrst  be  implemented  on 
lab-scale biodiesel systems, and their problems should then be ad- 
dressed before use in industrial applications. 

Despite  the  superiority  and  reliability  of  ML  technology  over 
conventional modeling techniques, it could not be regarded as a 
universal solution for all problems and loopholes in biodiesel re- 
search. This technology could be a proper complement or supple- 
ment to available techniques rather than an alternative framework. 
ML models that can provide highly transparent and easily inter- 
pretable  insights  are  preferred  to  the  black-box  approaches.  Be- 
sides, hybrid ML schemes can be regarded as promising alterna- 
tives to pure ML models to monitor, control, and optimize biodiesel 
systems because of their excellent interpolation and extrapolation 
capabilities. The topology and training parameters of ML models 
should also be optimized/tuned using advanced stochastic meta- 
heuristics in order to improve their reliability and accuracy. 

Having considered the current progress in hardware and soft- 
ware technologies, reliable and accurate ML-based soft-sensors will 
be  developed  and  implemented  in  the  coming  future  for  moni- 
toring and controlling biodiesel systems in real-time. It is envis- 
aged that the present review paper will stimulate more research 
aimed at developing and implementing real-time ML-based moni- 
toring and controlling systems for biodiesel systems with the aid of 
advanced measurement technologies. However, the signiﬁcant bar- 
rier to applying such measurement techniques in biodiesel systems 
is their high capital cost. Overall, ML technology can be eﬃciently 
used in the entire biodiesel chain, including feedstock selection, oil 
extraction, feedstock pretreatment, biodiesel synthesis, product re- 
ﬁning, quality assessment, biodiesel storage, fuel distribution, and 
engine application. The powerful ML technology can be potentially 
used  in  almost  all  biodiesel  research  ﬁelds  more  effectively  and 
practically than its present status.
