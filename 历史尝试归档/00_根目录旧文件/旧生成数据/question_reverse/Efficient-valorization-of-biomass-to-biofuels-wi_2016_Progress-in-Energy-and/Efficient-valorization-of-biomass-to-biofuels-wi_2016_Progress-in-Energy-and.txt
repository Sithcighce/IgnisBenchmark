Mono-functional catalytic materials are used for many types of chemical transformations, but are tedious
for delivering products from multiple-step reactions required for the valorization of biomass. An emerg-
ing trend is to integrate catalytic transformations, reaction engineering and product separation into a
single operation, wherein catalyst design is considered as the key approach to develop efficient, low energy
and environmentally-friendly reaction systems. Bifunctional solid catalysts open a door for carrying out
domino/cascade- and tandem/sequential-type reactions in a single pot, for which the number of isola-
tion or purification steps can be lessened or eliminated so that removal of unwanted by-products becomes
unnecessary. This review introduces bifunctional materials used in one-pot multiple transformations of
biomass into biofuels and related chemicals. Emphasis is placed on the assessment of the bifunctionality
of catalytic materials, including Bronsted–Lewis acid, acid–base, and metal particles–acid or base bi-
functional catalysts with some discussion being on combined catalytic systems with electrochemical, chemo-
enzymatic and photochemical methods. Plausible reaction mechanisms for key pathways are shown.
Relevant auxiliaries to boost catalytic activity and product selectivity, such as reaction media, heating
modes and morphological properties of the catalytic materials are analyzed. Use of appropriate bifunc-
tional catalytic materials provides many opportunities for design of highly efficient reaction systems and
simplified processing for producing biofuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass.

1. Introduction

Lignocelluloses composed of chitosan, lipids, microalgae,
macroalgae, polyols or polysaccharide and lignin units are the dom-
inant biomass resources in the environment [1]. Microbial,
thermochemical, and chemical/catalytic processes are three main
approaches of converting biomass into energy, biofuels or chemi-
cals [2]. Enzyme-mediated catalytic processes are the most common
way to produce bioethanol, butanol and biodiesel, in which pre-
treatment and post-treatment steps are used to remove compounds
toxic to the microorganisms. Thermal processing of biomass gives
syngas via steam gasification by partial oxidation at temperatures
from ~800 to 1000 °C [3] or bio-oil via fast pyrolysis with or without
catalyst at temperatures of ~500 °C [4,5]. Efficient processes for the

catalytic upgrading of both syngas and bio-oil to transportation fuels
are in high demand [6,7]. At lower reaction temperatures (ca. 300 °C),
thermal processing of biomass with catalytic methods offers the pos-
sibility of selectively yielding a narrow range of products and to
reduce the energy requirements of the transformations [8–10]. Tra-
ditional catalytic strategies have relied mainly on mono-functional
materials for chemical transformations and while they are able to
deliver the desired products for a wide range of substrates, they lack
efficiency when dealing with complex molecules [11–13]. Bifunc-
tional solid catalysts provide a method for efficiently transforming
complex substrates into products since they integrate sequential cata-
lytic steps and avoid by-product formation and separation [14–16].
In organic synthesis, bifunctional catalysis denotes simultane-
ous activation of both partners of a bimolecular reaction [17].

Bifunctionality of solid catalysts implies that the materials serve not
only as activators for chemical species, but also that they can ac-
tivate chemical species in a cascade of steps and possibly have
synergistic characteristics depending on the multi-step process
[18,19]. In other words, multiple catalytic steps are carried out in
a single pot with bifunctional catalytic solid materials that are de-
signed with the final product in mind. The combination of multiple
synthetic, enzymatic, homogeneous/heterogeneous and electro-
chemical catalytic systems in single pot operations, proceeding
through sequential/tandem- and cascade/domino-type reactions, can
significantly eliminate the isolation and purification of intermedi-
ates and prevent the formation of unwanted by-products [20,21].
Bifunctional solid catalytic materials are designed to exploit en-
hanced selectivity of the target products so that processing is
simplified.

In lignocellulosic biomass, the rigid structural backbone of the
cell wall is formed by combination of cellulose microfibrils with
hemicelluloses joined via hydrogen bonds, and this is surrounded
by resistant lignin sheaths that provide chemical and physical in-
tegrity against stress and degradation [22–24]. Pretreatment of
lignocellulosic biomass with a physical, physicochemical, chemi-
cal, biological and electrical methods alters its structure and allows
release of sugars in polymeric or oligomeric forms so that cata-
lytic transformations can proceed efficiently [25]. Fig. 1 illustrates
representative reaction routes for catalytic valorization of ligno-
celluloses. The distribution of products varies and is closely associated
with the type of catalysts applied. In the presence of acid catalysts,

cellulose and hemicellulose can be selectively converted into
5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural, respectively [26].
The isomerization of sugars with a Lewis acid or a base catalyst
acts as a vital bridge to connect polysaccharide hydrolysis and sub-
sequent monosaccharide dehydration, both of which can be
promoted by Bronsted and Lewis acids. The liquid fuel additive,
5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), can be synthesized via acid-catalyzed
etherification [27]. Hydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and
oxidation reactions are two major approaches to further upgrade
biomass into biofuels and value-added chemicals. The introduc-
tion of metal particles into upstream acid-mediated catalytic
processes, in some cases, is capable of realizing chain reactions in
a single pot. For example, HDO and oxidation of in situ generated
HMF from sugars are able to yield a liquid fuel 2,5-dimethylfuran
(DMF) or 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) [28], and a poten-
tial monomer for plastics 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA),
respectively [29]. However, competing reactions between oxida-
tion and dehydration such as glucose-to-gluconic acid oxidation
versus glucose-to-HMF-to-FDCA conversion, as well as between
hydrogenation/HDO and dehydration like glucose-to-polyols hy-
drogenation versus glucose-to-HMF-to-DMF transformation may
proceed nonselectively. Likewise, the cascade production of four-
or five-carbon furanic compounds such as furfuryl alcohol (FfA),
2-methylfuran (MF), 2-methyltetrahydrahydrofuran (MTHF), maleic
anhydride (MA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) from xylose may also
involve oxidation and hydrogenation of corresponding sugars. With
levulinic acid (LA) as the key intermediate, both pentoses and hexoses

can be transformed into γ-valerolactone (GVL), which is consid-
ered to be a potential fuel additive [30]. Most importantly, some
diesel fuels based on long-chain alkanes (C8—C15) are able to be pro-
duced from the integration of coupling, condensation, and
ketonization with subsequent hydrogenation of biomass-derived
molecules [31]. Catalytic oxidation, hydrogenation and HDO of pre-
treated lignin can correspondingly afford aromatic aldehydes, arenes
and cycloalkanes [32]. Some other biomass-derived species, like
microalgae and chitosan, can be used advantageously to produce
biofuels [33,34]; in particular, the production of biodiesel can be
achieved from simultaneous esterification and transesterification
of lipids catalyzed by Lewis/Bronsted dual acids or acid/base
bifunctionalized materials [35], and with some post-treatment steps,
the major by-product glycerol can be used to produce carboxylic
acids, esters, ethers, ketals/acetals, monohydric alcohols/diols, ac-
rolein, and alkanes/syngas through corresponding reaction routes
of oxidation, esterification, etherification/oligomerization, ketalation/
acetalation, hydrogenolysis, dehydration, and pyrolysis/gasification
[36].

Review articles on catalytic conversion of biomass report on re-
action routes and potential substrates for the production of biofuels
[37–40], catalytic performance for different catalysts [41,42], pro-
cessing methods [43,44], heterogeneous catalysis [45–47], underlying
mechanisms [48,49], and environmental and economic analyses
[50,51]. An emerging trend for biomass valorization is to integrate
the catalytic transformations, reaction engineering and product sep-
aration [52] processes into a single operation, wherein design of the
catalytic materials is considered as one of the key points for estab-
lishing efficient and environmentally-friendly processing systems

[53]. In this review, examples of one-pot multiple transformation
of biomass into biofuels and valuable chemicals over different types
of functional catalysts are presented. Emphasis is given on assess-
ing the bifunctionality of the catalytic materials and relevant
auxiliaries such as reaction media, heating modes, catalyst com-
positions and texture/morphology properties, and compatibility of
various reactions. Plausible reaction mechanisms and pathways are
discussed for specific products and catalytic systems.

2. Bronsted–Lewis acid bifunctionalized materials

2.1. Synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from hexoses

Efficient routes to HMF from six-carbon carbohydrates are im-
portant for developing methods to process lignocellulosic biomass,
since HMF is considered as a valuable precursor for the synthesis
of biofuels (e.g. DMF and DMTHF) and value-added chemicals such
as biopolymers [54–58]. Relatively high HMF yields can be achieved
from fructose substrate catalyzed by Bronsted or Lewis acids.
However, when glucose or glucose-derived bi-/polysaccharide is used
as the substrate, either low HMF selectivity or low substrate con-
version is observed in the presence of single Bronsted or Lewis acids
[54,56,57]. Qian et al. [59–61] demonstrated that Bronsted acids have
the capability to initiate both dehydration and isomerization reac-
tions of glucose through protonating the C2—OH to form a common
5-member ring intermediate, which implies that the formation of
HMF occurs via a direct cyclic mechanism, rather than via the open
chain mechanism that converts glucose to fructose and then to HMF
(Fig. 2). HMF selectivities and yields from glucose are extremely

sensitive to processing conditions using conventional Bronsted acid
dehydration processes [59]. The dehydration of glucose to HMF
begins from Lewis acid–catalyzed isomerization of glucopyranose
to fructofuranose [62,63], which can be further dehydrated into HMF
with Lewis or Bronsted acid catalysts (Fig. 2) [64–66]. The com-
bined use of Lewis and Lewis/Bronsted acids is considered to be an
improved approach for selective and efficient transformation of
glucose and glucose-based biopolymers into HMF via one-pot se-
quential isomerization–dehydration reactions. Wrigstedt et al. [67]
illustrated the role of Bronsted acids in Lewis acid–catalyzed
aqueous-phase glucose dehydration to HMF, namely that the fruc-
tose dehydration step could be accelerated by the addition of a
Bronsted acid (e.g. H3PO4, H2SO4, HNO3, and HCl) into a Lewis acid
(CrCl3·6H2O)–mediated system. A significant retardation of the
glucose conversion rate was observed due to the restrained forma-
tion of the chromium–glucose chelate complex during reaction,
which results in a substantial drop in the HMF yield. However, higher
reaction temperatures with systematical adjustment of pH areable
to obtain high HMF yields (ca. 50%) and efficient conversions (ca.
90%). Choudhary et al. [68] demonstrated that Bronsted acidity
retards aldose-to-ketose isomerization, while Lewis acidity in-
creases the overall rate of consumption of fructose and HMF by
promoting side reactions. Furthermore, those authors indicated that
it would be possible to maximize product yield by optimizing the
concentrations of Lewis and Bronsted acids as well as catalyst
structures/compositions in the cascade reactions.

Metal chlorides are considered as Lewis acids in 1-alkyl-3-
methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquids (ILs) and have been found
to be effective for the conversion of sugars to HMF [69–71], among
which chromium (II) chloride (CrCl2) is superior to others in the cata-
lytic process of glucose-to-HMF transformation, affording an HMF
yield of nearly 70% at 100 °C in 3 h [72]. For cellulose hydrolysis,
CuCl2 dissolved in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIM]Cl)
still displays high activity at 120 °C, but the product HMF yield is
less than 10% [73]. In contrast, a pair of metal chlorides (CuCl2 and
CrCl2) with CuCl2 mole fraction of 0.83–0.95 or a combination of CrCl2
and RuCl3 (with a molar ratio of CrCl2/RuCl3 = 4/1) in [EMIM]Cl at
temperatures of 80–120 °C could collectively catalyze the single-
step process of converting cellulose to HMF in nearly 60% yield. The
synergistic effect of two different metal chlorides on catalytic con-
version of glucose units into HMF probably occurs due to the
promotion of the cleavage of both α- and β-1,4-glucosidic bonds at
comparable rates as well as glucose-to-fructose isomerization. Chlo-
ride ions of ionic liquids and metal chlorides are able to accept

hydrogen species from the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. Weak ion-
paired halide ions promote disruption of the otherwise extensive
network of intra and interchain hydrogen bonds of cellulose [74,75].
However, interaction of CrCl2 with water results in the generation
of stable and coordinative saturated [Cr(H2O)6]2+ complexes that sig-
nificantly inhibit the catalytic activity of CrCl2. It is still difficult to
recycle the metal chlorides although solvent extraction, vacuum dis-
tillation, and N2 stripping have been proposed [48,56]. Homogeneous
catalysts require a recycle step that is time-consuming and energy-
intensive so that their application in practical processes is limited.
Ionic liquids (e.g., [BMIM]Cl and [EMIM]Cl) are considered to act
not only as a basic mediator, but also as a ligand for chromium that
lessens the negative effect of water on HMF yield and promotes isom-
erization and dehydration of glucose into HMF [76]. Organic solvents
(e.g., DMSO and DMA) can facilitate the formation of HMF by sup-
pressing the degradation of the furan ring, but separation by
evaporation and reuse of the solvent are problematic. Aqueous cata-
lytic systems are preferable due to efficiency, since in situ generated
metal ion hydroxo complexes (metal-hydroxo complexes + n H+
⇋
metaln+ + n/2 H2O) seem to promote isomerization of glucose to fruc-
tose in the case of some metal salts (e.g., AlCl3) [77]. The introduction
of protonic acids not only increases the content of Bronsted acid
sites to facilitate hydrolysis and dehydration reactions [78], but also
promotes the formation of metaln+ instead of metal-hydroxo com-
plexes (Fig. 3), thus hindering glucose isomerization which is the
key step of transformation [77]. Therefore, the ratio/distribution of
Bronsted acid to Lewis acid sites must be adjusted to allow both
the glucose-to-fructose isomerization and the hydrolysis/dehydration
step to proceed smoothly.

2.1.1. Supported ionic liquids (ILs)

Polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose) are difficult to be degraded via
simple heterogeneous catalysis that can be attributed to their strong
intra- and inter- molecular hydrogen bonds and the existence of crys-
talline and amorphous regions. Unlike neutral ionic liquids, acidic
ILs such as 1-(4-sulfonic acid)butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydro-
gen sulfate ([SO3H—BMIM]HSO4) exhibit higher activity for the
hydrolysis of cellulose than protonic acids such as HCl, HNO3, H3PO4,
and H2SO4 (70% vs. 40–60% conversion), and have improved cata-
lytic performance (88–89% conversion) for producing HMF (37%
yield) and furfural (18% yield) among different ILs with the addi-
tion of catalytic amounts of MnCl2 in a biphasic system consisting
of H2O/MIBK (methyl isobutyl ketone) reaction system (Table 1,
2−
Entries 1–6) [79], in which the coordination effect of —SO3H/SO4

with moderate acidity and MnCl2 occurs to promote cascade cel-
lulose hydrolysis and glucose dehydration reactions efficiently. By
employing —SO3H or COOH-functionalized IL as the Bronsted acid
counterpart, a series of other related metal chlorides including GeCl4,
FeCl2, FeCl3, CoCl2, ZnCl2, CuCl2, NiCl2, InCl3 and CrCl3 catalyze the
transformation of carbohydrates especially cellulose to HMF with
high yields (Table 1, Entries 7–16) [80–86]. Strong Bronsted acid ILs
seem to be necessary for the hydrolysis of cellulose, while metal
chlorides are active for the subsequent dehydration of glucose to
HMF. However, the recycle of acidic ILs tends to be complicated, since
water remains in the IL phase that leads to rehydration of HMF and
the formation of LA.

To improve the recyclability of IL-based catalytic systems, a series
of heterogeneous Bronsted–Lewis acid bifunctional materials have
been proposed (Table 1). Liu and Chen [87] used a polymeric IL (PIL)
as a catalyst support for catalyst recovery as well as biomass con-
version, and found that poly(3-butyl-1-vinylimidazolium chloride)
(P[BVIM]Cl) is effective for glucose-to-HMF conversion with up to
66% yields being obtained at 120 °C for 3 h when combined with
CrCl2 in situ or used as the prebuilt PIL metalate P[BVIM]+[CrCl3]− in
DMF (Table 1, Entries 17–19). The P[BVIM]Cl—CrCl2 catalyst remains
effective for the two-step transformation of cellulose into HMF cov-
ering cellulose-to-glucose conversion through controlled hydrolysis
in [EMIM]Cl, and then by adding the PIL-based catalyst for subse-
quent dehydration of glucose, achieves 50% HMF yield at 120 °C. The
analogous P[BVIM]Cl—AlCl3 catalyst is less effective than the PIL—Cr
system in glucose-to-HMF conversion (HMF yield: 49% vs. 66%), but
recycle tests show that the PIL—Al system is more robust because
less metal leaching occurs that allow an HMF yield of 42% to be ob-
tained for an average of 6 cycles. Immobilizing Cr3+ with SO3H-
functionalized solid PILs bearing counter anions such as Cl− and
3− (i.e., SO3H—PIL—Cl/CrCl3 and SO3H—PIL—PW/CrCl3) is found
PW12O40
to be effective for selective transformation of carbohydrates espe-
cially glucose into HMF [88]. In comparison to chloridion, the presence
of the heteropoly anion is able to enhance the hydrophobicity of
the PIL catalyst and the relatively low activation energy (22.02 kJ mol−1)
demonstrates its high catalytic performance in the production of
HMF from carbohydrates (Table 1, Entries 20 and 21). Providing a
local reaction microenvironment via immobilization on a solid porous
support is thought to allow coordination in the IL medium. For
example, Degirmenci et al. [89] introduced CrCl2 into an IL propyl-
3-methylimidazolium chloride ([PMIM]Cl) supported on the surface
of SBA-15 that lead to the formation of loosely bound, catalytically
active Cr2+ species. The resulting high mobility of these complexes
(CrCl2—Im—SBA-15; Im refers to immobilized imidazolium-based
IL) is found to be beneficial for selective glucose dehydration, and
affords an HMF selectivity of 70% for a glucose conversion of 50% in
H2O:dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/2-BuOH:MIBK at 150 °C for 3 h
(Table 1, Entry 22). The stability of CrCl2—Im—SBA-15 strongly
depends on the actual composition of the reaction medium, in par-
ticular, DMA used as solvent reduces the Cr leaching to 30%.
Complexing of DMA with Cr is likely to relieve the interaction of
Cr2+ chloride with water to form coordinatively saturated [Cr(H2O)6]2+
complexes that are inactive for HMF production from glucose. By

choosing an appropriate solvent, the degree of ion exchange and
swelling of the support can be lessened that is helpful to some extent
in lowering the leaching of active sites to a few percent. In the aqueous
phase, the leaching of IL in small amounts is detected, but it does
not seem to perturb the reaction (Table 1, Entry 22) [89].

By using a co-condensation method [90,127], a Lewis/Bronsted
acid bifunctional mesoporous catalyst (Taa-SBA-15) can be pre-
pared by incorporating 3-((3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl)thio) propane-
1-sulfonic acid into SBA-15-type silica (Fig. 4) that shows good
activity in the dehydration of aqueous fructose after a short time
of 0.5 h (Table 1, Entry 23), which is capable of affording a higher
selectivity to HMF (71%, with 84% conversion) than its sulfone de-
rivative at 130 °C after 141 min. The superior catalytic performance
might be due to the hydrophobic nature as well as the promoting
effect of Lewis acid thioether groups of Taa-SBA-15 on the
tautomerization of fructose to its furanose [90,127]. As evidence for
this, it has been reported that D001-cc resin having Bronsted acid-
rich sites is favored for the dehydration of fructose but it lacks Lewis
acid sites for conversion of glucose to HMF [128]. As an improved
approach, the D001-cc resin modified with Cr3+ can be obtained by
simple ion-exchange, in which it is found that the material con-
verts glucose into HMF with a yield of 61% in [BMIM]Cl at 110 °C
in 30 min (Table 1, Entries 24 and 25) [91]. In that work [91], the
HMF yields in two recycle tests were higher than that in the first
− with the IL
run, which might be the result of formation of CrCl4
or incomplete washing of residual substrate from the catalyst. Al-
though ICP-AES (inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
spectroscopy) shows the existence of leached elemental Cr in the
solution, examination of solids with TGA (thermogravimetric anal-
ysis) and EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) for adsorbed
chemical species and surface complexes show that some species
cannot be simply washed off so that method development is needed
to allow reliable assessment of catalyst reusability.

Other porous solids supported Bronsted–Lewis acid bifunc-
tional catalysts such as mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs)
functionalized with both sulfonic acid and IL ([HSO3 + (ILs/CrCl2)]-
MSN) (Table 1, Entries 26 and 27) [92], hydroxyapatite supported
chromium chloride (Cr-HAP) (Table 1, Entry 28) [93], tin hydroxide
nanoparticles-embedded montmorillonite (Sn-Mont) (Table 1, Entries
29 and 30) [94], and acid-chromic chloride functionalized natural
clay particles including treated attapulgite (ATP) and halloysite
nanotubes (HNTs) (ATP—SO3H—Cr(III) and HNTs—SO3H—Cr(III))
(Table 1, Entries 31 and 32) [95], as well as porous polymerized solid
acids [129,130] and bio-carbon-based solid acids [131,132] have been
explored for the carbohydrate-to-HMF transformation (Table 1). Aux-
iliary weak acidic groups like —OH and —COOH along with robust
Lewis/Bronsted acid sites of functionalized materials are respon-
sible for the enhanced catalytic activities shown in Table 1.

2.1.2. Metal oxides

From the point of view of cost, metal oxides, such as ZrO2- and
TiO2-solid catalysts, are good candidates for biomass conversion
(Table 1). Nevertheless, only low to moderate HMF yields have been
achieved from saccharides for unmodified ZrO2 and TiO2 catalysts

[133]. Three major routes have been developed to enhance the cata-
lytic performance of ZrO2 and TiO2 catalysts for carbohydrate-to-
HMF conversion (Table 1, Entries 33–44): (1) modification of ZrO2
and TiO2 with strong Bronsted acids such as H2SO4 and H3PO4 to in-
corporate Bronsted acid sites [96–98,134], (2) deposition of Zr or
Ti together with other metals like W and Mo bearing strong acidity
[99,100,135,136], (3) creation of porous and nano-sized ZrO2 and
TiO2 materials to make the sites more accessible to substrates
[101–103]. Thermal stability of the materials can be enhanced by
the metal–O–P bond formation (Table 1, Entry 45) [104].

Due to strong acidic properties and high stability for acid cata-
lytic reactions in aqueous solution, Ta2O5 and Nb2O5 derived catalysts
have been investigated to produce HMF from various substrates in-
cluding monosaccharides and polysaccharides in water, however,
the HMF yields obtained have not been very encouraging (Table 1,
Entries 46 and 47) [105,106,137,138]. Nakajima et al. [107] illus-
trated that Lewis acid sites (NbO4 tetrahedra) on the Nb2O5·nH2O
surface immediately form NbO4—H2O adducts in the presence of
water and a part of the adducts are able to function as effective Lewis
acid sites that promote HMF formation from glucose (Table 1, Entry
48) but simultaneously giving the formation of complex polymers
that could not be readily analyzed by HPLC (high-performance liquid
chromatography) or GC–MS (gas chromatography–mass spectrom-
etry) [139]. H3PO4-treated Nb2O5·nH2O (H3PO4/Nb2O5·nH2O) leads to
a large decrease in undetectable products and an increase in HMF
yield from 12% to 52% for the case of glucose-to-HMF transforma-
tion. It was speculated that most of the phosphate ions are fixed
as neutral —OH groups on Nb2O5·nH2O without covering Lewis acid
sites, which might reduce undesirable side reactions [107]. Another
possibility is that NbO4 tetrahedra species having effective posi-
tive charges as Lewis acid sites are still active in water even after
the formation of NbO4—H2O adducts.

In the water-2-butanol (2:3, v/v) biphasic system, niobic acid
treated with 1 M phosphoric acid and calcinated at 300 °C (abbre-
viated as NA-p) gives materials with large surface area and strong
acidic properties providing effective activity for dehydration of mono-
saccharides to HMF as well as hydrolysis of polysaccharides to give
HMF yields of 89% and 74% successively from fructose and inulin
via a one-pot reaction (Table 1, Entry 49) [108]. Several modified
tantalum oxide catalysts including mesoporous tantalum oxide pre-
pared by acid hydrolysis of tantalum penta-ethoxide in the presence
of a triblock co-polymer Pluronic L-121 (a non-ionic surfactant) at
room temperature and subsequent calcination at 550 °C for 6 h
(Table 1, Entry 50) [109], hydrated tantalum oxide treated with 1 M
H3PO4 and calcined at 300 °C for 3 h (Table 1, Entries 51 and 52) [110],
and mesoporous tantalum phosphate prepared from tantalum tar-
trate and ammonium phosphate monobasic in the presence of an
ionic surfactant at room temperature followed by calcination at
550 °C (Table 1, Entry 53) [111] exhibits high specific surface area,
strong acidity and remarkable stability, as well as high catalytic

activity (90%, 58%, 87% and 50–79% HMF yields obtained from fruc-
tose, glucose, inulin and juice of Jerusalem artichoke tuber,
respectively) in aqueous biphasic systems (e.g. H2O/MIBK, H2O-2-
butanol). Ordomsky et al. [140] demonstrated that the reactivity of
glucose conversion decreases in the order of niobium phosphate
(NbPO) > zirconium phosphate (ZrPO) > titanium phosphate
(TiPO) > aluminum phosphate (AlPO), corresponding to the amount
of strong acid sites on these catalysts. It was found that the selec-
tivity to HMF varies in the range of 30–60% and increases with the
decrease in the ratio of Lewis to Bronsted acid sites and the density
of isolated Lewis acid sites. Treatment of the catalyst with
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) decreased the content of isolated Lewis
acidity (Fig. 5), leading to a drastic increase in the selectivity toward
HMF owing to the coverage of Lewis acid sites that is non-selective
for the desired reaction process. The reaction mechanism was pro-
posed to occur via the adsorption of the carbohydrate substrate (e.g.,
glucose) onto the Lewis acid site for isomerization, followed by de-
hydration over an adjacent phosphate group to give HMF.

After screening a series of heterogeneous and homogeneous cata-
lysts including SnO2, WO3, SO2 + WO3, Sn—W oxide, Amberlyst-15,
Nafion NR-50, sulfated zirconia, H-mordenite, H—Y, H2SO4,
H3PW12O40, and hydrotalcite (HT), Yamaguchi et al. [112] found that
only Sn—W oxide bearing both strong Bronsted (97 μmol g−1) and
Lewis acid sites (37 μmol g−1) [141,142] are active for both glucose
isomerization and fructose dehydration, such that HMF yields of 48%,
39%, 42%, and 41% are achieved in THF/H2O (5/1, v/v) at 120 °C after
18 h from glucose, cellobiose, sucrose, and starch, respectively
(Table 1, Entry 54). Behera and Parida [113] prepared different weight
percentages (wt.%) of Sn-promoted vanadium phosphate (VPO) cata-
lysts by a wet-impregnation method using water as the solvent, and
the 20 wt% Sn—VPO afforded an HMF yield of 74% from glucose in
DMSO at 110 °C for 6 h (Table 1, Entry 55). The presence of both
Lewis and Bronsted acid sites in Sn—VPO plays an important role
in the two reaction processes involving isomerization and dehy-
dration in the one-pot reaction system. Without regeneration at high
temperatures, the Sn—VPO catalyst separated by centrifugation and
thoroughly washed with acetone could be reused four times with
almost constant HMF yields of ~70%. Alkaline earth phosphates in-
cluding calcium and strontium (i.e., CaP2O6 and α-Sr(PO3)2) with same
acid strength in the range of +3.3 ≤ H0 ≤ +4.8 prepared through a
modified co-precipitation method have been employed as hetero-
geneous catalysts for the transformation of sugars (e.g., fructose,
glucose, and cellulose) to HMF in hot compressed water (200–
230 °C) [114]. In the hydrothermal system, both phosphate catalysts
show similar catalytic reactivity toward the dehydration of mono-
saccharides after reacting for 5 min, providing HMF yields of 34–
39% and 20–21% from fructose at 200 °C and glucose at 220 °C
(Table 1, Entries 56 and 57), respectively, whereas the total yield
of HMF and glucose from the catalytic hydrolysis and dehydration
of cellulose at 230 °C for 5 min with α-Sr(PO3)2 (34%) is higher than

108

that with CaP2O6 (17%). Incorporation of metals such as Zr and Al
into mesoporous acidic solid supports like MCM-41 and TUD-1 can
give bifunctional solid catalysts that possess both Bronsted and Lewis
acid sites that have high surface areas, for which approximately 30%
HMF yields have been obtained (Table 1, Entries 58 and 59)
[115,116,143].

2.1.3. Modified heteropoly acids

Modification of heteropoly acids (HPAs) with large monovalent
cations such as Cs+ and Ag+ can overcome their limitations such as
high solubility in water and in polar solvents, low surface area and
poor thermal stability to allow the design of a range of insoluble,
microporous solid Lewis acid catalysts [144]. Shimizu et al. [145]
reported on the use of FePW12O40 and Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 for fructose
conversion in DMSO to give HMF yields of 100% and 91–97%, re-
spectively at conditions of 120 °C and 2 h. Water was removed during
the process, which apparently suppresses undesired reactions in-
cluding the hydrolysis of HMF to LA and partial dehydration of
intermediates to condensation products. The removal of adsorbed
water from the surface and near-surface of the catalyst can possi-
bly be enhanced by decreasing the catalyst particle size. Fan et al.
[117] found Ag3PW12O40 exhibits both Bronsted and Lewis acidi-
ties by pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy. Using water/
MIBK (1/2.25, v/v) as reaction medium, this bifunctional catalyst
proved to be suitable for the dehydration of glucose into HMF with
a yield of 76% at 130 °C for 4 h, and could be reused for up to six
reaction cycles with low leaching (5.1%) of Ag3PW12O40 (Table 1, Entry
60). Acidity modified silver exchanged silicotungstic acid (AgSTA)
catalyst catalyzes sucrose degradation (92%) in superheated water
to afford HMF in a yield of 63% at 120 °C in 160 min (Table 1, Entry
61) [118] and an HMF yield of 74% with a selectivity of 95% for fruc-
tose in the presence of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 catalyst in a biphasic system
consisting of water and MIBK in 60 min at 115 °C (Table 1, Entry 62)
[119]. Notably, only trace amounts of metal leaching determined
by UV–vis spectrometry and constant HMF yields are detected for
these polyoxometalates after being reused for several times. The high
durability of the catalyst can be ascribed to its negligible solubili-
ty in water and organic solvents as well as to the stable structure
of Keggin-type PW12O40

3− ions.

An HPA salt of an IL-forming cation functionalized with
propanesulfonate, 1-(3-sulfonic acid)propyl-3-methyl imidazolium
phosphotungstate ([MIMPS]3PW12O40), was synthesized, and used
as a “reaction-induced self-separating catalyst” in the conversion
of fructose to HMF [146]. An HMF yield of 99% is realized when the
reaction is conducted in 2-butanol for 2 h at 120 °C. Phosphotung-
stic acid, H3PW12O40 (PTA), encapsulated in MIL-101 (a chromium
terephthalate-based mesoscopic metal-organic framework) was also
evaluated as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the selective de-
hydration of fructose to HMF (63% yield within 60 min) in [EMIM]Cl
at 80 °C, although the catalytic system was ineffective for glucose-
to-HMF conversion [147]. Other catalytic functionalities like Lewis
acid or base sites are likely to be required for the achievement of
high HMF yields from glucose.

Zhao et al. [120] prepared a Bronsted–Lewis–surfactant-combined
HPA Cr[(DS)H2PW12O40]3 (DS: dodecyl sulfate) as a heterogeneous
catalyst for the one-pot conversion of cellulose to HMF. The Lewis

acidity of Cr[(DS)H2PW12O40]3 was considered to stem from the elec-
tron pair acceptor metal cation (Cr3+), and Bronsted acidity was
generated from some protons of PTA molecules. The addition of sur-
factant DS to the Cr–HPA-based solid acid helps the assemble of
micelles in water solutions, by providing a hydrophobic environ-
ment sufficient for protecting HMF from further decomposition and
by restricting formation of by-products. It was shown that 53% HMF
yield with 77% conversion is obtained directly from cellulose
in aqueous medium at 150 °C in 2 h (Table 1, Entry 63). The
Cr[(DS)H2PW12O40]3 had remarkable stability for approximately six
cycles after being subjected to hot CH2Cl2 extraction prior to each
recycle trial. The same research group designed an analogous
Bronsted–Lewis–surfactant-combined cetyltrimethyl ammonium salt
of polyoxometalate substituted with a transition metal (Cr3+)
[C16H3PW11CrO39 (C16: cetyltrimethyl ammonium)] [121]. Owing to
the formation of micellar assembles with favorable hydrophobic sur-
roundings, a high concentration of substrate could exist around the
catalytic sites, although lower conversions of HMF were observed.
In the process of catalytic transformation of glucose and fructose
into HMF, C16H3PW11CrO39 shows high conversion rates (84% and 90%,
respectively) and good yields (35% and 41%, respectively) in water
at 130 °C (Table 1, Entry 64). Furthermore, the catalyst is able to be
recovered by centrifugation from the reaction mixture with a leach-
ing rate of 0.4% as measured by ICP-AES, and it can be reused for
six times with fructose conversion rates and HMF yields for all runs
remaining around 90% and 40%, respectively. Several factors in-
cluding the coexistence of both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites in the
catalyst and the micellar structure containing hydrophobic groups
in coordination contribute to the high catalytic activity.

2.1.4. Zeolites

With respect to sulfated zirconia supported over mesoporous
silica (SBA-15) and homogeneous HPAs, Lanzafame et al. [148] dem-
onstrated that microporous materials exhibited higher selectivity/
yields of glucose and HMF from cellulose because of the presence
of shape-selectivity effects that limit the polymerization of prod-
ucts that form humic-type species. As an example, zeolites composed
of SiO4 and [AlO4]− tetrahedral are generally covered with micropores,
in which the negative charge of [AlO4]− tetrahedral compensated with
H+ gives zeolites high acidity [149]. An IL/zeolite/CrCl2 system was
reported to be efficient for selectively producing HMF (48% yield)
from cellulose at 120 °C via sequential hydrolysis and dehydration
(Fig. 6) [150]. Nevertheless, the imidazolium based ILs are expen-
sive and CrCl2 is hazardous to the environment. Jadhav et al. [151]
replaced the chromium salt with H-ZSM-5 zeolite to achieve a 45%
yield of HMF from glucose in [BMIM]Cl at 110 °C after 8 h. More-
over, the IL solvent could be substituted with a non-toxic ammonium
salt, tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC), to give an even higher
HMF yield of 56% at 110 °C within 4 h.

To improve the catalytic performance of Beta zeolite for the direct
transformation of glucose into HMF, Otomo et al. [122] examined
the effects of calcination and steam treatment on the structure of
Al atoms in the framework and its acidic properties. It was found
that the amount of Lewis acid sites increases at the expense of
Bronsted acid sites by partial cleavage of Si—O—Al bonds in the
framework to form Al species out of the *BEA framework, when the

ammonium-type Beta is calcined at temperatures greater than 700 °C
or is treated with steam (50 kPa in N2 balance) at temperatures more
than 500 °C. These bifunctional catalysts bearing Lewis acid sites
are effective for the production of HMF from glucose, and H-Beta
(Si/Al: 15) prepared by calcination at 750 °C shows a high HMF se-
lectivity (55%) at 78% conversion of glucose in H2O—DMSO/THF
reacting at 180 °C for 3 h (Table 1, Entry 65). With 13C NMR, the
authors clarified that glucose molecule are first isomerized to fruc-
tose through an intramolecular hydride transfer, and the generated
intermediate is subsequently dehydrated to HMF over Bronsted acid
sites (Fig. 7). The Beta zeolite catalyst could be recovered by filtra-
tion and regenerated by simple calcination and the HMF yield varied
from 43% to 40% for five consecutive runs. Employing [BMIM]Cl as
the reaction medium, H-Beta zeolite with a moderate Si/Al ratio of
25 has high catalytic activity due to the presence of Bronsted and
Lewis acid sites of the material that are in a suitable ratio (1.03),
leading to 50% HMF yield with 81% glucose conversion (Table 1, Entry
66) [123]. Furthermore, the combined use of H-Beta (Si/Al: 25) and
[BMIM]Cl allows multiple recycle with non-varying HMF yields after
calcination at moderate conditions and is efficient for transforma-
tion of other di- and poly-carbohydrates such as sucrose, cellobiose,
starch and cellulose into HMF with consistent yields (ca. 45%). Apart
from dealumination of zeolites, bimodal-HZ-5 zeolite (Si/Al: 30.15)
with a Bronsted/Lewis acid ratio of 0.817 fabricated by modifica-
tion of H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al: 37.00) with desilication is also efficient for
the hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose to HMF [124]. The post-
synthesized heterogeneous catalyst exhibits improvement in total
surface area, total pore volume and total acidity as compared with
the parent H-ZSM-5, and enhanced HMF yields of 46% for a cellu-
lose conversion of 67% can be obtained (Table 1, Entry 67). It is clear
that the modification of commercial zeolites through either
dealumination or desilication allow improvement of material

properties such as total surface area, pore volume/size and acidity,
and allow the development of robust catalysts for producing
HMF.

Sn-Beta zeolite has been reported to facilitate the isomeriza-
tion of glucose to fructose in aqueous media even at low pH
[152,153]. Nikolla et al. [125] described the combination of Sn-
Beta with a Bronsted acid HCl in a biphasic reactor system (H2O/
THF or H2O/1-butanol) to synthesize HMF from carbohydrates such
as glucose (Fig. 8), cellobiose, and starch with HMF selectivities over
70% at sugar conversions of around 75% at 180 °C. For Sn-Beta, the
addition of HCl to give a solution pH to 1 affords an improved HMF
yield (Table 1, Entries 68–70). The addition of inorganic salts (es-
pecially NaCl) results in efficient extraction of HMF from the aqueous
phase to the organic phase, thus improving HMF selectivity (Table 1,
Entries 70–73). Combination of a solid Bronsted acid Amberlyst-
70 (a macroporous polymeric catalyst) with a Lewis acid Sn-SBA-
15 (a mesoporous molecular sieve) or Sn-Beta for HMF synthesis
from sugars in a monophasic system using γ-lactones, THF or THF/
MTHF with water in a weight ratio of 9:1 affords high selectivity
for HMF (up to 70%) at glucose conversions of ~90% at 130 °C in 15–
60 min (Table 1, Entries 74–78) [126]. Although water is known to
promote side reactions in the dehydration of carbohydrates, it can
be beneficial at low concentrations for increasing the solubility of
sugars in the reaction phase. The effectiveness of glucose isomeri-
zation by the catalyst can be speculated to control the HMF
selectivity, which is determined by the extent of fructose forma-
tion in different solvents (i.e., THF > THF/MTHF ≈ GVL) [126]. Although
Sn-Beta predominantly isomerizes glucose to fructose via 1,2-
intramolecular hydride shift in both water and alcohol (e.g.,
methanol), Lewis acidic open Sn sites with Na-exchanged silanol
groups instead of proximal silanol groups are active for glucose–
mannose epimerization [154]. Therefore, an appropriate choice of

solvents and catalytic materials with well-controlled functional
groups/sites are crucial to obtain desired products in high yields.

2.2. Synthesis of furfural from pentoses

Among various bio-derived furan-type compounds, furfural is a
building-block chemical since its derivatives like MF, MTHF, THF, and
FfA are potential biofuel components, industrial solvents, and key
feedstocks [155–157]. Furfural produced from pentosan-rich biomass
by xylose cyclodehydration seems to proceed through a sequence
of cascade reactions involving Lewis acid-catalyzed isomerization
of xylose to xylulose and Bronsted acid-catalyzed dehydration of
xylulose to furfural (Fig. 9) [159,160]. In a non-enzymatic route for
xylose isomerization with the presence of a single Lewis acid cat-
alyst Sn-Beta zeolite in an aqueous solution, xylulose and lyxose are
the primary and secondary products, respectively [158]. At ~60%
xylose conversion, a maximum xylulose yield of 27% with an 11%
yield to lyxose is attained at 100 °C in 15 min. Analysis shows that
xylulose was thermodynamically and kinetically favored over lyxose
[161]. Thus, Bronsted-acid-catalyzed dehydration of xylulose to fur-
fural is faster than that of xylose to furfural, and the combined use
of Sn-Beta with a Bronsted acid catalyst (HCl or Amberlyst-15) can
produce furfural from xylose in a single pot at temperatures (~110 °C)
that are typically lower than those required for this reaction [158].
A furfural yield of ~38% is obtained using a combination of Lewis
(CrCl3) and Bronsted (HCl) acids compared with ~29% using HCl alone
at moderate temperatures (145 °C) in a single aqueous phase, and
a 76% yield of furfural is obtained with the same combination of
catalysts in a biphasic system using toluene as extractant (Table 2,
Entries 1–3) [162].

2.2.1. Molecular sieves

The isomerization of xylose to xylulose allows formation of fur-
fural by facilitating the process of dehydration. Lewis acid sites
promote xylose isomerization, but lower furfural selectivity by cata-
lyzing side reactions between xylose and furfural to form humins
(insoluble degradation products) [181,182]. Bronsted acids such as
H2SO4, Amberlyst-15, MCM—SO3H, and SBA-15—SO3H protonate the
hydroxyl groups on the xylose to promote furfural formation
[183–188], but at a lower rate than Lewis acids [189,190]. To design
efficient aqueous-phase dehydration catalysts, it is necessary to have
an appropriate distribution of Bronsted to Lewis acid sites (Table 2).
As an example, MCM-41 (Table 2, Entry 4) provides furfural in 44%
yield from xylose (97% conversion) at 170 °C after 3 h in n-BuOH/
H2O (3:2, v/v) solvent probably due to its high specific surface area
(800 m2/g), good adsorption capacity (average pore diameter = 3 nm),

sufficient pore volume (0.70 cm3/g) and acidity (10 μmol/g surface
acidity with a high Lewis/Bronsted acid sites ratio of ~15/1) [163].
Incorporation of niobium into MCM-41 with Si/Nb molar ratios of
either 25 or 50 (Lewis/Bronsted acid sites ratio: ~1/5–8) has higher
reactivity for xylose conversion (up to 99%) but lower selectivity to
furfural (39%) in toluene/H2O (7:3, v/v) (Table 2, Entry 5), the formed
terminal Nb—OH protons or Bronsted acidic protons associated with
Si—O—Nb bridges may be responsible for the enhanced substrate
conversion, but lead to the occurrence of side reactions (e.g., con-
densation) to lower the selectivity of product [164]. Microporous
AM-11 crystalline niobium silicate prepared from a gel with molar
compositions of 11.5Na2O:8.2SiO2:Nb2O5:418.6H2O gives a xylose
conversion of 90% and a significantly increased furfural yield of 50%
under identical reaction conditions (Table 2, Entry 6) [164]. The
microporous AM-11 catalyst is more active than HY zeolite (39% yield
at 94% conversion) and mordenite (28% yield at 79% conversion).
Appropriate concentration of niobium species (Si/Nb molar ratio:
2.3/1) is important to fix the distribution of Lewis-Bronsted acid sites
(molar ratio: ~1/2-3) to obtain high furfural yields. Impregnation,
rather than incorporation of niobium into the siliceous network of
MCM-41 materials, is another effective method for the dehydra-
tion of xylose to furfural (Table 2, Entry 7), for which a significant
increase in the furfural yield from 37 to 60% is obtained in the
−1 (0.5 g NaCl per gram aqueous
absence and presence of 0.5 gNaClgaq.sol.
solution) when using MCM-Nb16 catalyst with nominal 16 wt% of
Nb2O5 [165]. The combination of the highly distorted NbO6 octa-
hedra sites corresponding to Lewis acidic sites with the slightly
distorted surface NbO6, NbO7 and NbO8 sites associated with Bronsted
acidic sites on MCM-41 [191], as well as the promoting effect of Cl−
ions might be the reason for the superior results (Table 2, Entry 7).
Among the various supports (i.e., commercial fumed silica, γ-Al2O3,
MCM-41, and SBA-15 silica) those with different amounts of Nb2O5
(4, 12 and 20 wt%), the Al—12Nb catalyst with γ-Al2O3 support ap-
parently promotes secondary reactions, as compared with silica
supported catalysts, while SBA—12Nb and MCM—12Nb bearing both
Bronsted and Lewis acid sites as well as micro-mesoporous struc-
ture provide high xylose dehydration rates compared with
commercial silica. A xylose conversion of 84% and furfural selec-
tivity of 93% in water/toluene can be obtained with the SBA—12Nb
catalyst (Table 2, Entry 8) [166].

To modify the Lewis and Bronsted acid functionality and mor-
phological structure of zeolites, dealumination, desilication, and
incorporation of other species have been used and the resulting ma-
terials are effective for the isomerization of xylose and subsequent
dehydration to yield furfural [192–194]. Under batch conditions,
H—MCM-22 zeolite and its delaminated counterpart (ITQ-2),

furfural yields of up to 71% and 54% are obtained at more than 96%
xylose conversion with a water/toluene (3/7, v/v) and a water solvent
system, respectively (Table 2, Entry 9) [167]. A decrease in the Si/
Al ratio from 38 to 24 for H—MCM-22 increases the total amount
of Lewis plus Bronsted acid sites and improves catalytic perfor-
mance without significantly affecting furfural selectivity. With the
same Si/Al molar ratio of 24, the ITQ-2 catalyst exhibits compara-
ble catalytic activity to its counterpart H—MCM-22 and correlates
with the like total amounts of Lewis and Bronsted acid sites of these
materials. The structure of the catalysts can be regenerated by
thermal treatment to remove organic residues, and furfural yields
in consecutive uses remain approximately constant [167]. In a similar
manner, a composite material consisting of commercial nano-
crystalline zeolite Beta (Si/Al: 12) in the protonic form incorporat-
ed in a purely siliceous TUD-1 mesoporous matrix (denoted Beta/
TUD-1) is an effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed conversion of
xylose into furfural and gives a higher furfural yield than bulk Beta
(74% vs 54%) at xylose conversions of 98% in H2O/toluene (3/7, v/v)
(Table 2, Entry 10) [168]. Delaminated zeolite del-Nu-6(1) with Si/
Al: 29, obtained by swelling and ultrasonication of a laminar
precursor of Nu-6(2) (i.e., Nu-6(1) with Si/Al: 38) [195], which has
a specific surface area about seven times higher than that for proton-
exchanged Nu-6(2), promotes the reaction to have a rate of about
two times higher than that for H—Nu-6(2), affording a relatively fur-
fural yield of 47% in a water–toluene (3/7, v/v) biphasic reactor
system (Table 2, Entry 11), compared with 34% in the presence of
an H-mordenite sample with Si/Al of ~6 [169]. The yield of furfu-
ral from C6 sugar was low with Bronsted acids such as mineral acids
(H2SO4 and HCl) and A70 (with —SO3H), Lewis acids (γ-Al2O3), and
combined Bronsted and Lewis acids (a mixture of γ-Al2O3 and A70);
whereas the furfural yield was significant when zeolites (H-
mordenite and H-Beta) were used, and yields of furfural (>30%)
could be produced from glucose by cascade dehydration and
decarbonylation using GVL as the solvent (Table 2, Entry 12) [170].
Both C6 and C5 sugars have the potential to be converted into fur-
fural with zeolite catalysts.

2.2.2. Metal oxides

Despite the advantages of zeolites, many forms are not stable
in aqueous solutions under hydrothermal conditions (ca. ~150 °C)
[196,197] so that their use requires careful consideration of the re-
action system. Silicoaluminophosphate catalysts (SAPO) containing
bifunctional Lewis and Bronsted properties are found to have good
stability under hydrothermal conditions (Table 2, Entry 13) [171],
of which SAPO-44 with a Si/P ratio of 44 gives 63% furfural yields
for a one-pot conversion with hemicellulose substrate and has con-
stant activity for multiple cycles (Table 2, Entry 14) [172]. The
catalytic performance of SAPO-11 with a Lewis/Bronsted acid ratio
of 0.48 (total acid content: 111 μmol/g) is superior to its counter-
part SAPO-44 with a ratio of 1.3 (total acid content: 119 μmol/g)
in xylose-to-furfural conversions (35% furfural yield; Table 2, Entries
14 and 15), indicating the importance of the distribution of Bronsted
and Lewis acid sites [171]. Metal oxide–based Bronsted–Lewis acid
bifunctional solid catalysts such as exfoliated titanate, niobate and
titanoniobate nanosheets (Table 2, Entry 16) [173], mixed-oxide
TiO2—ZrO2 (Table 2, Entry 17) [174], sulfated zirconia/titania (Table 2,
Entries 18 and 19) [175,176], tin–tungsten mixed oxide [198], and
Zr—(W,Al) mixed oxides (Table 2, Entry 20) [177] are effective solid
catalysts in the aqueous-phase dehydration of xylose to furfural. Nev-
ertheless, active water soluble species leach metal oxides and affect
the dehydration activity of these catalysts (Table 2, Entry 21)
[178,199]. Regeneration of the catalysts can be realized by the
removal of residual species through the use of H2O2 as oxidant or
calcinations at certain temperatures (Table 2, Entries 22 and 23)
[179,180]. To meet the specifications of a clean, renewable, and eco-
nomical facility for producing furfural from sugars on the industrial

scale, development of robust and stable Bronsted/Lewis acid
bifunctionalized solid zeolite-like materials is urgently needed.

2.3. Synthesis of levulinic acid or levulinate esters

Reactions producing LA and levulinate esters (LEs) from sugar
molecules represent important pathways for the transformation of
biomass to chemicals and biofuels [200–202]. LEs such as methyl
levulinate (ML) and ethyl levulinate (EL) have numerous potential
applications in the fragrance and flavoring industry and can be used
as additives for diesel and biodiesel transportation fuels [203–206],
as well as preferred substrates for chemical conversion to many other
products [207].

Under relatively harsh conditions (ca. 200 °C) at low sulfuric acid
concentrations (≤0.01 mol L−1) in methanol solvent, glucose can be
rapidly (ca. 10 min) and almost quantitatively converted into a key
and stable intermediate product methyl glucoside, which when
allowed to react to completion (150 min) provides methyl levulinate
in yields of 50% (Table 3, Entry 1) [228]. The formation of LA and
LEs (24–65% yields) from glucose or cellulose can be obtained with
other —SO3H mono-functionalized homogeneous and heteroge-
neous materials [e.g., SO3H—SBA-15, sulfonated chloromethyl
polystyrene, 1-(1-propylsulfonic)-3-methylimidazolium chloride
([PSMI]Cl), and [C4H6N2(CH2)3SO3H]3−nHnPW12O40 (n: 1, 2 and 3; HPA
ILs)] in various reaction systems (Table 3, Entries 2–5) [208–211].
Relatively long reaction times and high temperatures are general-
ly required for high yields of LA and LEs, otherwise alkyl
glucopyranosides are likely to be the major products in alcohols at
low temperatures (<140 °C) [211].

2.3.1. Molecular sieves

−/HPO4

The combination of Lewis and Bronsted acids has a strong syn-
ergistic effect on catalytic activity for the direct decomposition of
glucose to LA [229–231] as shown in Table 3. With respect to the
CrCl3—H3PO4 mixed acids, catalytic systems with a CrCl3/H3PO4 ratio
of 0.4–0.5 show superior reactivity (Table 3, Entries 6–8) [212].
Bronsted acids can increase the H+ concentration, facilitating the
Lewis acid–mediated glucose-to-fructose isomerization thus en-
hancing selectivity [232]. In the subsequent dehydration reaction,
2− combine with 2,5-dioxohex-3-enal to form
CrCl3 and H2PO4
a complex, promoting the decomposition of the intermediates like
HMF to LA. In this scenario, zeolites and mesoporous materials offer
efficient conversion routes from crude biomass due to their high
concentration of active sites, high thermal/hydrothermal stability
and enhanced shape selectivity (i.e., the selective accessibility of re-
actant, intermediate, or product to zeolite pores) [233]. In general,
aluminum-free Lewis acidic zeotype materials and mesoporous mo-
lecular sieves containing Sn, Ti, or Zr are able to isomerize hexoses,
pentoses and trioses, and convert them into desirable chemicals
[234–238]. Saravanamurugan and Riisager [213] show that glucose
efficiently isomerizes glucose to form fructose in alcoholic media
over zeolites such as HY(2.6), HUSY(6), HUSY(30), Hβ(12.5), Hβ(19)
and HZSM(15) without auxiliary Lewis acid metals (e.g. Sn, Ti and
Zr) other than Al. As compared with other zeolites, HUSY(6) con-
taining more Lewis acid sites [239] as well as a certain amount of
Bronsted acid sites facilitate the isomerization of (methylated)
glucose to fructose and the succeeding dehydration and rehydra-
tion to ML in methanol provides relatively high yields (ca. 50%)
(Table 3, Entry 9).

Metal halides, especially chromium chloride, facilitate mutaro-
tation and isomerization of glucose to fructose with simultaneous
dehydration to HMF, and the subsequent rehydration with hydro-
nium ions affords LA [240,241]. An alternative method is to modify
the HY zeolite structure by combining the zeolite and metal halide
(CrCl3) to form a hybrid catalyst for improving the catalytic prop-
erties and enhancing LA yields [214]. The catalytic reaction of the

hybrid catalysts is predominantly influenced by the type of acid sites
(Lewis acidity enhanced by Cr3+), amount of acid sites and strength
surface area, hierarchical porous structures and shape selectivity so
that high LA yields (ca. 62%) are achieved with the 1:1 weight ratio
of CrCl3 and HY (Table 3, Entry 10). A series of Fe/HY zeolite cata-
lysts was composed of HY zeolite and FeCl3 prepared by wet
impregnation method exhibit high acid site density and increased
number of Lewis acid sites, in which Fe/HY catalyst with 10% Fe
loading provides high catalytic performance with 62% LA yields being
obtained from glucose (Table 3, Entry 11) [215] with a total reduc-
ing sugar (TRS) yield of 61% being obtained from cellulose in
[BMIM]Br (Table 3, Entry 12) [216]. Those authors [215] show that
Lewis acid sites promote isomerization of glucose into fructose and
that the combination of Bronsted and Lewis acidity favors the
dehydration/rehydration reaction, while the increase in the number
of Lewis acid sites might also decrease the yields of LA by promot-
ing the decomposition of glucose and reaction between glucose and
furfural to form humins. LA can also be synthesized from xylose con-
version involving an intermediate hydrogenation of furfural to FfA
assisted by co-produced formic acid under hot-compressed water
[242].

Zeolites commonly encounter drawbacks associated with their
microporosity including limited accessibility of active sites to the
substrate and the existence of strong internal diffusion limitations
in the liquid-phase conversion of biomass or biomass-related chemi-
cals. Aluminosilicate catalysts with improved texture properties have
been achieved through: (1) use of an organic template for intro-
ducing mesopores and obtaining relatively narrow pore-size
distributions [243–245], (2) reducing the crystallite sizes of zeo-
lites to the nano-scale and embedding nanocrystalline zeolites into
mesoporous silica matrices [246], and (3) delaminating lamellar pre-
cursors of zeolites [247,248]. Neves et al. [217] found that several
aluminosilicates including mesoporous Al-TUD-1, composite Beta/
TUD-1 and nanocrystalline zeolite H-Beta, as well as ITQ-2 and the
zeolite counterpart H-MCM-22 are active to transform FfA into EL
in ethanol solvent (Table 3, Entries 13–17). Among these catalysts
(Table 3, Entries 13–17), Al-TUD-1 gives high EL yields (ca. 80%)
despite its relatively weak acidity that is essentially of the Lewis
type, which might be attributed to its high specific surface area that
enhances active site accessibility along with its inhibition of by-
products. SBA-15 incorporated with Al by the post-synthesis method
with a nominal Si/Al molar ratio of 30:1 and the Ni- or Ru-doped
Al—SBA-15 and ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by wetness impregna-
tion have characteristic properties of mesoporous materials (9.23 nm)
and an increased acidity (SBA-15: 0.23 mmol/g < Al—SBA-15:
0.45 mmol/g < 10 wt% Ni/Al—SBA-15: 0.53 mmol/g < 10 wt% Ru/
Al—SBA-15: 0.64 mmol/g < 20 wt% Ru/Al—SBA-15: 0.81 mmol/g;
ZSM-5: 0.51 mmol/g < 20 wt% Ru/ZSM-5: 0.70 mmol/g) [218]. The
moderate increase of Ru amount in ZSM-5 and Al-SBA-15 cata-
lysts increases the levels of LA, and provides LA selectivities as high
as 44% for glucose for a 20 wt% Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst (Table 3, Entries
18–21) [218]. The acid content and porous properties proved to be
important keys to control yield and selectivity of LA, wherein the
MFI structure of ZSM-5 is suitable for glucose monosaccharide
hydrothermolysis while the hexagonal mesoporous structure of
Al—SBA-15 is preferable for hydrothermolysis of starch polysac-
charide (Table 3, Entries 18, 19, 22 and 23).

2.3.2. Resins and oxides

For polymer based acid ion-exchange resins with Bronsted acid,
the incorporation of Lewis acid sites enhances their reactivity for
carbohydrate-to-LA transformations. Fe-resin prepared by modifi-
cation of Dowex 50 with Fe3+ through cation exchange shows both
Bronsted and Lewis acidity, and gives 91% conversion of cellulose
and ~80% total selectivity of glucose (39% yield) and LA (33% yield)
in 5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution (Table 3, Entries 24 and 25) [219].

Graphene oxide (GO)-based solid catalysts with SO3H functional
groups (GO—SO3H) are efficient for the selective decomposition of
glucose into LA giving a yield of 78% for glucose conversions of 89%
(Table 3, Entry 26) [220]. Lewis acid sites caused by the electron in-
ductive effect of the S=O double bonds in the surface sulfate complex
[249], together with the presence of other functional groups such
as carboxyl and hydroxyl play positive roles in enhancing the isom-
erization and adsorption of glucose for the reaction. The layered
morphology of GO—SO3H allows rapid diffusion of the reactants and
products, and the SO3H groups are thermally stable and do not cause
leaching into the reaction mixture. Introduction of Bronsted acid
sites such as phosphate [250,251], sulfate [221–223], and superacid
groups [224] into metal oxides (e.g., ZrO2, SnO2 and TiO2) bearing
Lewis acid or Lewis base sites responsible for glucose-to-fructose
isomerization [225] gives moderate to good catalytic performance
for sugar-to-LA/LE transformations (Table 3, Entries 27–33).

To identify the dominant reaction routes for the synthesis of LA
from sugars, Yang et al. [252] studied acid-mediated conversion of
glucose and fructose in aqueous solutions with density functional
theory (DFT). The dehydration of fructose catalyzed by a Bronsted
acid catalyst is preferential for protonating —O2H hydroxyl group,
thus there are a number of potential reaction paths to HMF. The
succedent rehydration of HMF to give LA is difficult and competes
with polymerization or condensation processes that result in the
formation of humins. When glucose is the reactant, the —O1H group
is the preferred protonation site. In this case, HMF is unable to be
formed in the relevant reaction paths, which leads to humin pre-
cursors and reversion products. However, in the DFT simulations,
LA can be produced from glucose through a reaction mechanism
possibly without forming fructose and HMF intermediates, since pro-
tonation of other sites including —O2H, —O3H and —O5 positions
is able to activate glucose at a lower rate. Nevertheless, these sim-
ulation results are in contradiction with the known reaction pathway
to some extent, since fructose and HMF are key intermediates for
LA formation from sugars containing glucose units. Hence, an al-
ternate route can be hypothesized for sugar-to-LA transformation,
in which five-membered ring carbocations are initially generated
by direct activation of the —O1H, —O2H, —O3H and —O5 sites, fol-
lowed by a sequence of acid-catalyzed isomerization reactions to
some specific intermediates that are dependent on catalytic systems
and that ultimately lead to LA by decarboxylation.

Li et al. [226] reported one-pot transformation of cellobiose into
LA and formic acid via an aqueous phase partial oxidation (APPO)
process illustrated in Fig. 10, wherein both the Bronsted-acidic sites
in the IL cations and the redox catalytic sites in the polyoxometalate
(POM) anions of [PyBS]5PV2Mo10O40 catalyst are involved. At an oxygen
partial pressure of 3 MPa, 100% cellobiose conversion with 46% se-
lectivity to LA and 26% selectivity to formic acid is obtained (Table 3,
Entry 34). The prepared [PyBS]5PV2Mo10O40 is remarkably stable and
gives LA selectivities of about 45% for multiple uses. Examination of
the spent catalyst with 51V NMR spectroscopy of the spent catalyst
did not reveal any evidence of impurities or degradation. In con-
trast, the simple catalytic material ZrO2 provides LA yields of 52%
through catalytic partial oxidation of cellulose in aqueous media under
lean air pressure of 2.4 MPa with 2.8% O2 at 240 °C in 20 min (Table 3,
Entry 35) [227]. In this catalytic process, gluconic acid rather than
HMF is the key intermediate to produce LA (Fig. 10), thus this shows
the importance of redox over acid–base properties for the ZrO2 cata-
lyzed oxidative deconstruction of cellulose. Recycle of the ZrO2 catalyst
gave yields of LA that slightly decreased from ~50% to ~40% over five
uses, for which the ZrO2 catalyst was only regenerated once by facile
calcination at 250 °C after the first cycle.

It can be deduced that the isomerization of glucose into fruc-
tose promoted by Lewis acid sites is a key step for transforming
glucose units into LA or its esters and the hydrolysis/dehydration/
rehydration reactions are favorable with combination of Bronsted

and Lewis acid sites. Nevertheless, the increase in Lewis acidity may
also decrease the yield of LA or its esters by promoting nonselec-
tive decomposition of glucose units and the reactions among
substrates, intermediates (e.g., fructose and HMF) and products to
form soluble polymers and humins [253]. The integration of acidic
sites with redox properties allow catalysis of the partial oxidation
of glucose or cellulose to gluconic acid other than HMF, followed
by decarboxylation to yield LA. Therefore, the development of func-
tional catalytic materials containing acidic sites appropriately
combined with other active species that can promote different re-
action pathways shows great potential for efficient valorization of
biomass to LA and other biorefinery products.

2.4. Other methods and products

2.4.1. Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) for coke

The ideal process for conversion of solid biomass into liquid fuels
would be one that could occur in a single step at short reaction times.
Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) is a promising candidate for convert-
ing oxygenated compounds generated from pyrolysis into gasoline
range aromatics in the presence of a zeolite catalyst (Fig. 11)
[254–257]. Among the various zeolites such as silicalite, Beta,

Y-zeolite and silica–alumina, HZSM-5 (Si/Al: 600) has superior ar-
omatic yields and gives the least amount of coke with more than
30 molar carbon% of aromatics being obtained from glucose, xylitol,
cellobiose, and cellulose at a reaction temperature of 600 °C and a
reaction time of 240 s [258]. In pyrolysis, HZSM-5 zeolites with high
silica-to-alumina ratios, which correlate with a large separation of
acid sites, are effective for eliminating methoxyl groups, cleaving
ether and aliphatic C—C bonds, and dehydrating aliphatic hy-
droxyl groups [259]. Bronsted acid sites have a critical role in the
upgrading reactions in consideration of HZSM-5 more active than
silicalite-1 [260,261]. Lewis acid sites play an important role in hy-
drogen atom transfer that is a major factor in aromatization
[262,263]. For example, Zn-doped HZSM-5 improves furan conver-
sion (100% vs. 80%), yielding more benzene (72% vs. 29%), carbon
oxides (6% vs. 3%), and alkenes (>6% vs. ~6%) than native HZSM-5
catalyst at 500 °C within 13 min [264]. H-atom transfer activity, pos-
sibly correlated to the Lewis acid sites offered by exchanged Zn
cations, is important for high aromatic yields, and probably sup-
presses the alkylation of benzene to toluene. Cheng et al. [265]
report that Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts increase the yield of
aromatics through CFP process by 40% compared with that of stan-
dard HZSM-5 catalysts, in which Ga catalyzes both the desired

decarbonylation reactions and olefin aromatization, while the ZSM-5
portion of the catalyst promotes the remaining reactions such as
oligomerization and cracking to produce aromatics.

The micropore openings in ZSM-5 used in that study had a size
in the range of 5.2–5.9 Å which is close to the optimum required
for conversion of glucose toward aromatic species [266]. It was
shown that the aromatic yield was a function of the pore size of
the zeolite catalyst, that is, the majority of aromatics and oxygen-
ated species present during reaction are accessible to the pores of
most medium and large-pore zeolites but are excluded from en-
tering small pores. Desilication of HZSM-5 zeolite with 0.5 M NaOH
solution creates intraparticle mesopores in the microporous zeolite,
producing more aromatic hydrocarbons (carbon yields of 26–30%)
and less coke (40–41%) in CFP of beech wood than the parent
microporous HZSM-5 (23% aromatics and 44% coke) [267]. Acid
dealuminated HZSM-5 (leaching agent of H3PO4, H+ concentration
of 2 mol/L, temperature of 20 °C, and time of 4 h) decreases the coke
yield from 44% with original HZSM-5 to 27%, and affords in-
creased yields of target chemicals (14% olefins and 32% aromatics)
compared with the original HZSM-5 catalyst (10% olefins and 25%
aromatics) [268]. Zeolites with small pores severely hinder the dif-
fusion of both reactants and products and are unable to produce
aromatics from glucose, instead yielding a mixture of oxygenates,
CO, CO2 and coke, while zeolites with large pores allow for fast re-
actant diffusion and lead not only to the formation of larger amounts
of polyaromatics, but also to significant coke formation [269]. Several
oxygenates such as HMF, furfural and guaiacol might also be formed
in relatively high yields [270–273], which would contribute to rapid
coke formation and catalyst deactivation on HZSM-5 during pyrol-
ysis oil upgrading [274].

2.4.2. Phthalic anhydride

As discussed above, furanic compounds (e.g., benzofuran) gen-
erated in HZSM-5 nanopores are important intermediates in
producing aromatic-range biofuels [275,276]. In the CFP of biomass,
a Diels–Aldol reaction followed by a ring-opening process involv-
ing dehydration reaction has been reported as the key reaction
pathway [277]. Lewis acidity is more effective than Bronsted acidity
at catalyzing Diels–Alder cycloaddition among different types of acid
catalysts [278,279]. The WOx—ZrO2 and zeolite-based catalysts such
as HY, Hβ and Snβ bearing both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites,
however, are active for conversion of biomass-derived furans to aro-
matics under relatively mild conditions (around 200 °C) [280–283].
This dehydration process is inherently difficult, because the formed
intermediates are sensitive to heat and readily undergo retro-Diels–
Alder reaction [284]. For this issue, mixed sulfonic carboxylic
anhydrides used as strong acylating agents rapidly cleave the ether
rings with high selectivity to their ring-opened products [285], and
an 80% selectivity to phthalic anhydride is obtained from biomass-
derived furan and MA after running the reaction for 2 h at 25 °C to
form a stable intermediate from the Diels–Aldol product assisted
by acetyl methanesulfonate (Fig. 12), followed by dehydration at 80 °C
for 4 h to drive the reaction to completion [286].

2.4.3. 5-Ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF)

The compound EMF, which has an energy density of 8.7 kW h L−1,
is a promising second generation biofuel [287]. Generally, Bronsted
acids catalyze HMF, fructose and fructose-based sugars to produce
EMF in high yields, but are inactive for glucose-to-EMF transfor-
mation [288–295]. To explore the possibility of directly converting
glucose to EMF, Lew et al. [296] developed a catalytic system by

combining the Lewis acid zeolite Sn-Beta with Bronsted acid
Amberlyst 131 in a single pot. In this catalytic system, the isom-
erization of glucose to fructose proceeds with zeolite Sn-Beta, and
the resulting fructose is dehydrated to HMF followed by etherifi-
cation to afford EMF using Amberlyst 131 (Fig. 13). After reacting
at 90 °C for 24 h, an EMF yield of 31% is obtained from glucose in
ethanol. EL is readily formed during synthesis of EMF from HMF and
fructose in the presence of strong Bronsted acid catalysts at high
temperatures [297–299].

2.4.4. Alkyl lactates

In contrast, Lewis acids, especially Sn-Beta, might facilitate the direct
conversion of hexoses such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose into alkyl
lactates [300–302]. In the catalytic process of sugar-to-alkyl lactate con-
version, it is generally accepted that the conversion involves initial
isomerization of aldose into ketose, followed by retro-aldol to the cor-
responding trioses, glyceraldehyde (GLY) and dihydroxyacetone (DHA),

while the use of disaccharides and polysaccharides would entail an ad-
ditional cleavage to glucose or fructose that could be promoted by
Bronsted and Lewis acids [303] before the retro-aldol cleavage (Fig. 14).
Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the conversion of
GLY and DHA to alkyl lactates [305–308]. In one reaction pathway, both
Lewis acids and weak Bronsted acids such as acetic acid catalyze se-
quential dehydration and rearrangement of GLY in equilibrium with
DHA [309] into pyruvic aldehyde (PAL) [310,311], and the resulting PAL
is further converted into the desired alkyl lactates in the presence of
a Lewis acid in alcoholic solvents, otherwise an undesirable acetal by-
product would be generated in a parallel reaction path under the action
of strong Bronsted acid groups (Fig. 14) [304]. A Lewis acid in combi-
nation with a weak Bronsted acid is not only effective for the formation
of HMF and furfural [312–314], but also plays an important role in
catalyzing glucose into fructose [315,316] and retro-aldol reaction of
hexoses into trioses to facilitate the formation of alkyl lactates [317–
319].

Acid catalysts are generally preferable for raw oils containing
moisture and free fatty acids (FFAs) in the simultaneous esterifi-
cation of FFAs and transesterification of triglycerides to produce
biodiesel [320,321]. At a reaction temperature (ca. 200 °C), esteri-
fication and transesterification steps can be both promoted by a
Bronsted catalyst such as 12-tungstophosphoric acid [322,323]. In-
troduction of Lewis acid sites into the catalytic process can lower
the reaction temperature [324–326], implying a synergic effect
between Bronsted and Lewis acid sites on simultaneous esterifica-
tion and transesterification reactions in biodiesel production.

2.4.5. Glycerol-derived chemicals

A significant surge in biodiesel production will cause a surplus
of glycerol to exist, and thus glycerol is expected to be among the
top 12 most important bio-based chemicals in the world [327]. Se-
lected value-added chemicals that can be obtained from glycerol
through various pathways are shown in Fig. 15 [328]. Among these
pathways, the glycerol-to-acrolein dehydration is a typical acid-
catalyzed reaction.

Two different reaction pathways for glycerol dehydration have
been proposed on the basis of the type of acid sites: (1) Bronsted
acid sites sequentially promote dehydration of the internal second-
ary hydroxyl groups and primary hydroxyl groups of glycerol to afford
acrolein (Fig. 16a), while (2) Lewis acid sites exclusively catalyze one
step dehydration of the primary hydroxyl group of glycerol to
produce acetol (Fig. 16b) [329–331]. Foo et al. [332] investigated the

role of Lewis and Bronsted acid sites in the dehydration of glycer-
ol on niobium oxide and Na+-exchanged niobium oxide using FT-
IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) supported by DFT
calculations. It was found that Lewis acid sites activate primary C—O
bonds of glycerol to form 2-propene-1,2-diol, but Bronsted acid sites
are involved in the formation of acrolein. Wang et al. [333] dem-
onstrated that exclusively tuning Lewis or Bronsted acid sites does
not promote acrolein production from glycerol, and that Bronsted
acid sites with neighboring Lewis acid sites in a bifunctional cat-
alyst like zeolite ZSM-5 are necessary for two-step dehydration of
glycerol to acrolein. The two-step catalytic process might consist
of Bronsted acid sites initiating the reaction via dehydration of the
secondary hydroxyl groups of glycerol, and Lewis acid sites
completing the reaction in a second reaction step through the de-
hydration of the primary hydroxyl groups to form acrolein (Fig. 17).

2.4.6. Oxygen-containing precursors for diesel and jet fuels

To form oxygen-containing precursors with carbon chain lengths
in the range of the diesel (C9—C21) [334] and jet fuel (C8—C16)
[335,336], C—C coupling reaction of biomass-derived platform mol-
ecules with carbon atoms no more than six is considered to be a
promising approach. The groups of Dumesic [337,338] and Huber
[339] initially proposed the idea of making C8—C15 alkanes with fur-
fural as the feedstock by successive aldol condensation, hydro-
genation and HDO. In this catalytic process, the aldol condensation
is efficiently catalyzed by homogeneous and heterogeneous bases

[340–343], however, solid acids are seldom employed. Kikhtyanin
et al. [344,345] showed that both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites of
zeolites (e.g., H-ZSM-5, H-Beta, H-MOR, H-USY and MWW) might
be involved in aldol condensation of furfural with acetone to yield
4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-on (FAc) as well as a certain amount of 1,4-
pentandien-3-on-1,5-di-2-furanyl (F2Ac). Unlike base catalysts, an
additional product (FAc)2 was formed as a result of FAc dimeriza-
tion over Bronsted acid sites (Fig. 18). To determine the role of Lewis
and Bronsted acidity in aldol condensation of furfural and acetone,
a number of metal organic framework (MOF) materials possess-
ing Lewis acidity have been investigated. Bronsted acidity, lead by
structural defects, rather than Lewis acidity of Cu—BTC (copper
benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) or Fe—BTC (iron benzene-1,3,5-
tricarboxylate) seems to be primarily responsible for the high
catalytic performance [346]. Likewise, hydroalkylation/alkylation
(HAA) of MF with biomass-derived aldehydes or ketones to carbon-
chain increased oxygenates could also be efficiently catalyzed by
Bronsted acids [347–352]. Pt-loaded ZrP bearing Bronsted and Lewis
acidity showed enhanced catalytic performance for the subse-
quent hydrogenolysis reaction as compared with Pt-loaded
SiO2—Al2O3, TiO2, and Nb2O5 catalysts [353]. In general, the specif-
ic activity of small metal particles is superior to large particle
counterparts, while the coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms

present in the small particles are prone to cleave C—C bonds as com-
pared with the low index planes that dominates in large particles.
In this respect, one more reason for the higher selectivity to C15
alkanes over the Pt/ZrP catalyst can be the result of the larger Pt
particle size in the Pt/ZrP catalyst that is helpful to prevent the unde-
sirable C—C cleavage reactions. Both the acidity of solid support and
the characteristics of the metal particles are two important factors
for improving catalytic activity for multiple-step reactions.

Variation of reaction systems with Bronsted–Lewis acid bifunc-
tional catalytic materials allows a wide range of products to be
formed. Further, by adjusting Bronsted–Lewis acid sites, use of active
metals or supports along with relevant morphological structures,
control of product distributions and reaction pathways is possi-
ble. Bifunctional acidic materials are broadening the spectrum of
biorefinery products and accelerating practical methods for trans-
forming biomass resources.

3. Acid–base bifunctionalized materials

Acids and bases can be used effectively in solid catalytic mate-
rials by spatially isolating acidic and basic sites [354]. Acid–base
bifunctionality of a catalyst promotes chemical transformations via
active site isolation so that a wide range of biomass conversions are

m/c-ZrO2 has the highest amount of acid sites (0.67 mmol/g) and
base sites (0.55 mmol/g), whereas a-TiO2 has the highest density of
acid sites (0.08 mmol/m2) and base sites (0.04 mmol/m2) among
these compounds. The a-TiO2 has superior catalytic activity for the
glucose-to-HMF transformation (Table 4, Entries 4–6) [358]. In a
study of TiO2 and ZrO2 for glucose and fructose conversion in water
under microwave irradiation, Qi et al. [359] reported that solid base
ZrO2 could promote isomerization of glucose to 1,2-enediol (fruc-
tose), and HMF would be formed by an additional acidic condition
(Table 4, Entries 7 and 8). In this regards, ZrO2 in combination with
2−/TiO2—SiO2 (3:4, w/w) catalyzes the degradation
a solid acid SO4
of corn starch hydrolyzate (glucose solution) to attain HMF in a yield
of 48% (Table 4, Entry 9) [360].

To enhance the acidity of metal oxides, mineral acids such as H3PO4
and H2SO4 can be introduced by impregnation [387,388]. Acid-modified
oxides show enhanced reactivity in the dehydration of fructose and
glucose units to HMF (Table 4, Entries 10–22). For example, sulfated zir-
2−/ZrO2) prepared by mixing zirconium hydroxide with 1M
conia (SO4
H2SO4 and subsequent calcination gives a fructose conversion of 94%
with an HMF yield of 73% in acetone–DMSO mixtures (Table 4, Entry
2−/ZrO2 by further
10) [361]. Investigation on the bifunctionality of SO4
incorporation of aluminum species in varied loadings was carried by
Yan et al. (Table 4, Entry 11–13) [362]. Yang et al. found that with an
increase in Al content, the number of acid sites decrease while the
number of base sites increase so that an optimized HMF yield of
2−/ZrO2—Al2O3 catalyst
55% could be obtained from starch over SO4
having a Zr/Al molar ratio of 1:1 (acidity: 1.55 mmol/g, basicity:
0.52 mmol/g) (Table 4, Entries 14–16) [363]. Submonolayer SO4 cov-
erages in sulfated catalysts (SO4/ZrO2) with a suitable SO4 content
(~1.5 wt% SO4) offer an ideal balance of basic and Lewis–Bronsted
acid sites (with a molar ratio of ~1/3.55) and promote isomeriza-
tion of glucose to fructose and subsequent dehydration of fructose
to HMF (Table 4, Entries 17–22) [364].

Hydrotalcite (HT), which shares some similar catalytic proper-
ties as ZrO2, is active for promoting isomerization of glucose to
fructose, as well as xylose to xylulose [365,389], but HT is inactive
for hydrolysis/dehydration reactions (Table 4, Entries 23–28) [366].
In the presence of both HT and Amberlyst-15, HMF is produced in
moderate yields (up to ~54%) from glucose, sucrose, and cellobi-
ose in a polar aprotic solvent such as DMSO, N,N-dimethylformamide,
and DMA (Table 4, Entries 29–36) [367,368]. Glucose/fructose and
xylose/xylulose, galactose/tagatose and arabinose/ribulose are con-
verted into HMF and furfural, respectively, and 5-methyl-2-
furaldehyde is produced from rhamnose/rhamnulose under the

possible when one considers acid-catalyzed and base-catalyzed
routes to a product [355]. Representative studies on catalytic trans-
formation of biomass and its derivatives to selected chemicals are
discussed in the following sections.

3.1. HMF and furfural

In hydrothermal systems, homogeneous alkali catalysts are ef-
ficient for promoting glucose isomerization to fructose and
homogeneous acid catalysts are active for facilitating fructose de-
hydration to HMF (Table 4, Entries 1–3) [356,357]. Solid acid–base
catalysts, namely, metal oxides, anatase TiO2 (a-TiO2), rutile TiO2 (r-
TiO2) and monoclinic/tetragonal mixture ZrO2 (m/c-ZrO2) have been
employed for the glucose-to-HMF transformation. The metal oxide,

combined action of HT and Amberlyst-15 (Fig. 19; Table 4, Entry 37)
[369,370]. This catalytic system promotes mixtures of carbohy-
drates containing arabinose, rhamnose, and lactose to produce
furfural (31% yield), 5-methyl-2-furaldehyde (MFD, 29% yield), and
HMF (32% yield), respectively, in N,N-dimethylformamide (Table 4,
Entry 38). Combined with the strongly acidic polymer resin
Amberlyst-15, a layered basic zirconosilicate Na2ZrSi4O11 is capable
of catalyzing glucose transformations to give HMF at 45% selectiv-
ity and 87% glucose conversion (Table 4, Entry 39) [371]. A solid base
catalyst zirconium carbonate (ZrC) applied to the same reaction
affords 17% yield of LA after 12 h reaction in water–toluene biphasic
solvent (Table 4, Entries 40 and 41) [372]. The product distribu-
tion depends on the types of substrates, the reaction media, and
the catalyst type.

Other combined solid acid–base catalysts have been developed
for sugar-to-HMF conversions. Pérez-Maqueda et al. [373] re-
ported an efficient catalytic process for the preparation of HMF from
sucrose following a sequence of four steps (hydrolysis, dehydra-
tion, glucose/fructose isomerization and dehydration) catalyzed by
reusable cation- and anion-exchange resins, Amberlite IR120 (H+)
and Amberlite IRA-400 (OH−) to give an isolated HMF yield of 50%
(Table 4, Entry 42). Peng et al. [374] synthesized a series of
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with large pore sizes (ca.
30 nm) functionalized with acid (—SO3H, denoted as LPMSN—SO3H),
base (NH2, LPMSN—NH2) and both acid–base (—SO3H and NH2,
LPMSN-both) functional groups with a grafting method. A mixture
of LPMSN—SO3H and LPMSN—NH2 (1:1, w/w), and LPMSN-both ex-
hibits comparable efficacy for one-pot cellulose-to-HMF conversion
in an IL [EMIM]Cl in the presence of a trace amount of water (Table 4,
Entries 43 and 44), and good yields of glucose and HMF are ob-
tained for LPMSN—SO3H and LPMSN—NH2 mixed catalyst (~39 and
19%, respectively) and LPMSN-both (36 and 15%, respectively).

Side-reactions of HMF hydration occurring on acidic sites with water
molecules are likely to be inhibited by the basic sites [390,391]. Wang
et al. [375] designed and synthesized mesoporous acid catalysts
(P—SO3H-x, x stands for the water contact angle on the surface of
solid catalyst) with different water wettabilities including
superhydrophobic P—SO3H-154, hydrophobic P—SO3H-125 and
P—SO3H-105, and hydrophilic P—SO3H-44 [392]. Among these solid
acids, PSO3H-154 with superhydrophobic character is more favor-
able for isolating water molecules from the acidic sites and for
suppressing further hydration of HMF to LA. To realize one-pot trans-
formation of glucose to HMF, solid bases with controllable wettability
(P—VI-x) synthesized from copolymerization of divinylbenzene,
1-vinylimidazole and N,N-methylenediacrylamide have been pro-
posed [375]. Although, the pure base catalyst (P—VI-0) or pure acid
catalyst (P—SO3H-154) is practically inactive for the formation of
HMF, the combined catalysts, superhydrophobic P—SO3H-154 and
superhydrophilic P—VI-0 give HMF with yields as high as 95% in
DMSO—THF (3:2, w/w) (Table 4, Entries 45–47). The super-
hydrophobicity of the solid acid P—SO3H-154 facilitates the isola-
tion of the acidic sites from water molecules and inhibits the
hydration of HMF while the superhydrophilic base P—VI-0 pro-
motes glucose-to-fructose isomerization, thus, their combination
gives superior catalytic performance.

3.2. HMF- and furfural-derivatives

As discussed in Section 2.4, catalytic sequential dehydration and
etherification of carbohydrates into EMF proceeds in the presence
of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts with Bronsted
acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites (Fig. 13). Nevertheless, relatively
low yields of EMF are always observed, owing to the lack of cata-
lytic sites for etherification of HMF with ethanol as well as the low

stability of EMF that tends to be converted into EL [393]. Consid-
ering that the catalytic activity of etherification can be controlled
by both the surface basicity and Lewis acidity [394–396], a series
of nanocatalysts functionalized with both acidic and basic sites was
synthesized from the self-assembly of the corresponding basic amino
acids with PTA [376]. These obtained acid–base bifunctional hybrid
nanospheres that act as heterogeneous catalysts are effective for the
conversion of fructose, sucrose and inulin to EMF and give an EMF
yield of 77% through sequential dehydration–etherification reac-
tion over Lys/PW(2) in EtOH/DMSO (Table 4, Entry 48). The
nanocatalyst Lys/PW(2) functionalized with acid (1.28 mmol/g) and
base (0.21 mmol/g) sites is able to be reused six times with EMF
yields slightly decreasing from 77% to ~70%. In this cascade cata-
lytic process, solid acid sites promote the dehydration of fructose
to HMF in ethanol, and the subsequent etherification is promoted
by both surface basicity through deprotonation of alcohol and Lewis
acidity by facilitating the elimination of the OH group.

Catalytic transfer hydrogenation between —OH of alcohols and
—C:O of furan aldehydes can be facilitated by acid–base pair sites
through Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction [397]. Hao
et al. [377] demonstrated that ethanol could be used as hydrogen
donor and solvent for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of biomass-
derived HMF to 2,5-bishydroxymethyl furan (BHMF) over low-
cost ZrO(OH)2, with a maximum BHMF yield of 89% at HMF
conversion of 94% being obtained (Table 4, Entry 49). The —OH
groups and Zr—O species of ZrO(OH)2 successively contribute to weak
basic and Lewis acidic sites, which are important for the activity
of the MPV reaction. However, the presence of excess acid sites cata-
lyzes BHMF to its ether counterparts (Fig. 20). The increase of
substrate concentration accelerates the self-etherification of HMF,
thus directly leads to a decrease in selectivity toward BHMF and its
bis-ether product (Table 4, Entries 50–53) [378,379]. Therefore, ap-
propriate substrate concentration and number of acid–base sites are
important for obtaining desired yields of etherified products.

When furfural is used as substrate, Song et al. [380] demon-
strated that zirconium phosphonate (Zr—PhyA) synthesized from
phytic acid (PhyA) reacting with ZrCl4 is active for the selective MPV
reduction in 2-propanol, affording furfuryl alcohol (FfA) with a yield
of 99% (Table 4, Entry 54). The good performance of Zr—PhyA is due
to the formation of in situ basic sites (O2− in phosphate groups,

1.32 mmol/g) and Lewis acidic sites (Zr4+, 0.51 mmol/g). In the cata-
lytic process, 2-propanol is adsorbed onto Zr—PhyA, followed by
dissociation to the corresponding alkoxide and H species by the acid–
basic sites (Zr4+—O2−), thus increasing the reaction rate of the MPV
reaction. As a downstream product of furfural, alkyl levulinates can
be synthesized through cascade hydrogenation (with Lewis acid–
base sites) and alcoholysis (with Bronsted acid sites) in alcohols
(Table 4, Entries 55 and 56) [381,382]. It can be concluded that the
distribution of products derived from HMF and furfural can be ad-
justed by controlling the content and type of acid–base sites in a
bifunctional solid catalyst.

3.3. Biodiesel

Apart from enzymatic and Bronsted/Lewis acid-mediated cata-
lytic processes [398–402], biodiesel can be efficiently produced
through simultaneous esterification and transesterification reac-
tions promoted by acid–base bifunctional catalysts. As compared
with acid-catalyzed transesterification of vegetable oils, base-
catalyzed reactions proceed faster and are less corrosive, therefore,
industrial processes usually favor base catalysts [403,404]. The tra-
ditional homogeneous base-mediated catalytic process is simple and
fast, but the neutralization/washing step requires the consump-
tion of acids, and generates acid/base wastes [405]. Moreover, soap
formation occurs under homogeneous alkaline catalysis when the
raw oils contain more than 1 wt% of total FFAs [406,407]. A two-
step process of acid-catalyzed esterification followed by base-
catalyzed transesterification is commonly employed to resolve the
problems of saponification, slow reaction rate and biodiesel sta-
bility in biodiesel production with high FFA content for which the
process involves multiple reactions, washing, and separation
stages [408,409]. Impregnation of extra active sites (i.e., Al2O3 and
KOH) into ZrO2 possessing both acidity and basicity [410] is an ef-
ficient approach for catalyzing simultaneous esterification and
transesterification of raw oils containing high FFAs (Table 4, Entries
57 and 58) [383,384]. Through investigating the catalytic perfor-
mance of three thermally robust ZrO2-based catalysts including
titania zirconia (TiZ), sulfated zirconia (SZ), and tungstated zirco-
nia (WZ) for esterification and transesterification, López et al. [411]
found that TiZ bearing relatively higher basicity has the lowest

125

activity for esterification but is more active than WZ for
transesterification. Sulfated zirconia is the most active catalyst (on
a weight basis) for both transesterification and esterification reac-
tions examined by López et al. [411], although it exhibits significant
sulfur loss that greatly reduces its long-term activity.

Lanthanum can affect zinc oxide distribution, as well as in-
crease the surface acid and base sites, because of the strong
interaction between Zn and La species [385]. Among possible Zn/
La catalysts, Zn3La1 was found to simultaneously catalyze oil
transesterification and FFA esterification reactions in a single-
step, while minimizing oil and biodiesel hydrolysis. High yields (up
to 96%) of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) are obtained even using
unrefined or waste oils (Table 4, Entry 59). Integration of Ca and La
metal oxides enhance their catalytic activity in simultaneous
transesterification and esterification reactions as compared with sole
bulk CaO and La2O3 (Table 4, Entries 60–62) [386,412], which may
be attributed to the increased surface acidic and basic sites that
become activated by dispersed CaO on the composite surface. During
esterification, the interaction of the carbonyl oxygen of FFAs with
the Lewis acidic site of the catalyst is speculated to assist in the for-
mation of carbocation and the subsequent nucleophilic attack of the
alcohol that produces FAMEs via elimination of water molecule from
a tetrahedral intermediate. In a parallel reaction of transesterification,
methanol is adsorbed onto the Lewis base site of the catalyst to form
oxygen anion, followed by nucleophilic attack to the esters pro-
ducing two kinds of esters through the break of hydroxyl groups
of a tetrahedral intermediate. Therefore, appropriate control of acid–
base site distribution can facilitate one-pot production of biodiesel
from triglycerides with high content of FFAs through concurrent
transesterification and esterification reactions.

3.4. Other methods and biomass-derived chemicals

Acid/base catalysis plays an important role in most practical
biofuel processes such as esterification and transesterification of plant
oils containing FFAs with alcohols to produce biodiesel, and
pretreatment/hydrolysis of lignocellulose to fermentable sugars for
bioethanol production [413]. However, shortcomings of catalysts with
single acid or single base sites are encountered. In the case of bio-
diesel production over a basic catalyst, the presence of FFAs and
water always leads to the formation of soaps and the difficulty in
the catalyst and product separation.

3.4.1. Nanosized mixed oxides for obtaining isobutene from
bio-ethanol

A range of related reaction pathways for upgrading biomass-
derived molecules with high efficiency have been realized by acid–
base catalysis. Nanosized ZnxZryOz mixed oxides with balanced acid
and base sites can directly catalyze the conversion of bio-ethanol
to isobutene in yields as high as ~83% at 450 °C with a steam to
carbon ratio (S/C) of 5 and residence time of 0.11 s·g·mL−1 (Fig. 21)
[414]. The addition of ZnO into ZrO2 selectively passivates strong
Lewis acidic sites and weakens Bronsted acidic sites of zirconia, but
enhances the basicity [414]. Basic catalysts such as ZnO—CaO and
ZnO—Fe2O3 are effective for the conversion of ethanol to acetone
[415], although the selective transformation of acetone into isobutene
requires microporous acidic zeolites [416]. A specific microporous
environment in zeolites does not appear to be a critical factor in
the ZnZr materials for selectively producing isobutene from acetone,
possibly due to the moderate Bronsted acidity of ZnxZryOz cata-
lysts [416]. Acetone can be formed from gas-phase dehydration of
1,2-propanediol in the presence of basic catalyst such as CeO2 and
MgO, while strongly acidic catalysts (−8.2 < H0 ≤ −3.0) show high se-
lectivity for propanol as compared with basic (H− ≥ +7.2) and acidic
catalysts with either weaker (−3.0 < H0 ≤ +6.8) or stronger acidity
(H0 ≤ −8.2) [417]. In contrast, a wide range of products are

ican Chemical Society.

obtained from 1,3-propanediol dehydration over these acid–base
catalysts, owing to the absence of a secondary —OH group. For the
case of glycerol-to-acrolein dehydration, the reactivity is con-
trolled by the strength, type and the amount of the acidic sites and
hindering as much as possible the number, strength and action of
the basic sites [418]. The combined use of acid–base catalysis favors
glycerol transesterification and carbonylation with urea to give glyc-
erol carbonate [419], etherification to short-chain polyglycerols [420],
and steam reforming to hydrogen [421]. Some reactions such as
cascade isomerization–dehydration–Knoevenagel condensation
[422], tandem deacetalization-nitroaldol [423], and cooperative aldol
condensation [424] can be implemented with acid–base bifunc-
tional catalysts. Co-existence of acid−base sites in a single catalyst
at some level provides a degree of cooperative catalysis that have
enhanced catalytic performance compared with physical mix-
tures of monofunctional catalysts. Acid–base bifunctional catalytic
materials greatly expand the scope of development for biomass
transformations.

4. Acid/base–metal bifunctionalized materials

Biomass refineries deal with highly-oxygenated compounds that
are upgraded to moderately-oxygenated and deoxygenated plat-
form molecules. Dehydration, etherification, C—C coupling reactions
including aldol-condensation, ketonization, oligomerization and
hydroxyalkylation over acid and base catalysts are capable of re-
moving oxygen functionalities and increasing carbon number of the
feedstock compounds [425]. Some of the challenges for convert-
ing biomass into products are related to the efficient cleavage of
alcoholic C—O linkages within the feedstock molecules to reduce
both degree of polymerization and oxygen content, as well as the
selective oxidation of —OH into specific functional groups. Pre-
cious metal catalysts (e.g., Au, Pd, Pt and Ru) and non-precious metal
catalysts (e.g., Fe, Cu and Ni) with the presence of acid/base addi-
tives or supports exhibit good activities for hydrogenation/
hydrogenolysis and oxidation reactions [426–428]. Synthetic
procedures for these supported metal nanoparticles, impregna-
tion, calcination and subsequent reduction of metal ions with H2,
NaBH4, carbon/CO, and alcohols are frequently adopted. This section
introduces advances in metal nanoparticles combined with acid/
base catalysis for transformation of biomass derivatives into chemical
products.

4.1.1. Oxidation of sugars and polyols

The selective oxidation of alcohols in aqueous solution over sup-
ported metal catalysts is facilitated by high-pH conditions. Oxygen

atoms originating from hydroxide ions formed via catalytic decom-
position of a peroxide intermediate instead of molecular oxygen are
incorporated into the alcohol during the oxidation reaction [429]
so that the acidity of the support can play a role in the activity and
selectivity of the catalysts [430]. In this regard, acid or base prop-
erties are essential for metal-catalyzed oxidation processes with high
conversion rates and selectivities. Cooperative effects between metal
particles and solid support related to structure and textural char-
acteristics influence the selective oxidation of alcohols [431].
Anaerobic and aerobic conversions of carbohydrates promoted by
bi- or multifunctional catalysts are two important renewable routes
to produce organic acids and aldehydes/ketones [432]. In these cata-
lytic processes, conversions and selectivities to target products
depend on oxidants, pH values, catalysts, and reactor operating con-
ditions [433–436]. When the pH of the reaction solution is
unregulated, strong adsorption of acids onto a metal surface occurs,
causing the poisoning of metal catalysts during oxidation of sugars
[437]. To prevent inactivation of metal particles, buffering of reac-
tion solutions is necessary when using this approach for selective
conversion of biomass derivatives that involve oxidation.

Selective oxidation of sugars could produce commercially rele-
vant polyoxy-acids, such as gluconic acid, which is widely used in
the chemical, food, pharmaceutical and textile industries. Glu-
conic acid is produced via selective oxidation of glucose in the C1
position [438]. Much attention has been paid to the production of
gluconic acid via liquid phase oxidation catalyzed by metal par-
ticles such as Pd and Au (Table 5, Entries 1–3) [439–441]. In
comparison to monometallic systems, bimetallic catalysts are capable
of enhancing reactivity, but typically exhibit low stability because
of metal leaching that occurs during reaction (Table 5, Entries 4-8)
[442,443]. Metal oxide supported catalysts are more active for
glucose-to-gluconic acid transformation than supported or free metal
colloids (Table 5, Entry 9) [444], and they have relatively higher sta-
bility over the long-term than other solid supports such as carbon
[464,465]. Table 5 shows that base sites resulting from solvents, solid
supports, or co-existent metal oxides are helpful to increase the se-
lectivity toward gluconic acid from glucose oxidation. When
biopolymers (e.g., cellobiose and cellulose) are used as substrate,
acidity is necessary for hydrolysis to occur before intermediate prod-
ucts can be oxidized.

Acid–base pairs combined with metal particles (Table 5) seem
to be exclusively used for the oxidation of saccharides. Under base-
free conditions, Rautiainen et al. [445] demonstrated that microwave
heating could provide an efficient catalytic system for the oxida-
tion of glucose to gluconic acid (76 % yield) in the presence of
supported Au nanoparticles (Table 5, Entry 10). In contrast,
Wojcieszak et al. [446] reported that glucuronic acid, except glu-
conic acid, is the dominant oxidized product from glucose over Au/
CeO2 and AuCs/CeO2 under oil heating and base-free conditions
(Table 5, Entries 11 and 12). The improved activity of the Au cata-
lyst after being doped with Cs may be the result of an increase in
local surface basicity caused by CsOH species. However, many re-
action mechanisms involving acid–base properties of the catalysts
are not well understood yet, so that detailed studies on this topic
are needed.

Formic acid is a promising medium for both hydrogen storage
and production, and it is also an important commodity chemical.
By using a Keggin-type polyoxometalate (H5PV2Mo10O40) as homo-
geneous catalyst, p-toluenesulfonic acid as additive, oxygen as oxidant
and water as solvent, water-insoluble biomass such as wood, waste
paper, cyanobacteria and xylan can be transformed into formic acid
with up to 53% yield (Table 5, Entry 13) [447]. Without the addi-
tion of strong acid, water-soluble glucose is oxidized into formic acid
in yields of up to 49% with molecular oxygen (Table 5, Entry 14) [448]
and up to 52% with air (Table 5, Entry 15) [449] over H5PV2Mo10O40.
The H5PV2Mo10O40 has been used as a bifunctional catalyst for the

degradation of cellulose to formic acid with 35% yield (Table 5, Entry
16), where it was speculated that cellulose was first hydrolyzed into
glucose, followed by oxidation involving electron and oxygen trans-
fer processes to produce formic acid (Fig. 22) [449]. In this process,
catalytic oxidation to formic acid and deep hydrolysis to byproducts
proceeds in a competitive way that can be adjusted by changing O2
partial pressure, reaction temperature and acid concentration
(Table 5, Entries 17–21) [450–453]. Together with formic acid, some
other organic acids such as lactic acid, acetic acid, and glycolic acid
are also formed from sugars via sequential reactions (Table 5, Entries
22–29) [454–456].

Starting from polyols, formic acid can be generated via oxida-
tion processes. For instance, Zhang et al. [457] reported that
V-substituted phosphomolybdic acids were active for oxidation of
glycerol to formic acid in highly concentrated aqueous solutions with
molecular oxygen, and 3.64 g formic acid was produced from 10 g
glycerol/water (50/50, w/w) solution (Table 5, Entries 30 and 31).
In an aqueous solution of Lewis acid (e.g., FeCl3, ZnCl2, CrCl3 or AlCl3),
Ru(OH)4/r-GO catalyst prepared via refluxing, RuCl3 aqueous solu-
tion containing graphite oxide (GO) promotes the oxidation of
glycerol to formic acid (Table 5, Entries 32–35) [458]. A synergis-
tic effect between Ru(OH)4/r-GO and FeCl3 is observed for glycerol
oxidation such that high formic acid yields (ca. 60%) are obtained.
The oxidation of C3 oxygenates to C1 oxygenates might simultane-
ously yield the C2 (C3→C2+C1) products. For the case of glycerol
oxidation, Kapkowski et al. [459] detected that sol–gel SiO2-
supported Au affords high acetic acid yields (up to 90%) besides single
carbonaceous products with glycerol conversion of 100% in a dilute
and viscous H2O2/H2O liquid phase (Table 5, Entry 36). Bimetallic
Au/Cu and Au/Ni catalysts obtained by nano-Au transfer show com-
parable performance, while Cu or Ni leaching results in deactivation
of these catalysts during the reaction. A large number of oxidized
chemicals including dihydroxyacetone, glyceric acid, lactic acid,
hydroxypyruvic acid, dihydroxymalonic acid, glycolaldehyde,
glycoxylic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, tartronic acid, mesoxalic
acid and other unstable intermediates can be produced via
chemoselective oxidation of glycerol (Fig. 23) by controlling the type
of the support, the size of the metal particles, and the acid/base prop-
erties of the reaction medium [466–468]. Control of product
selectivity is necessary for efficient valorization of glycerol in con-
sideration of its wide product distribution for different catalytic
processes. Nanoparticles promoted by acid/base solid supports or
reaction media, in most cases, show good selectivity for the desired
products in the chemoselective oxidation of glycerol, but lead to rel-
atively low glycerol conversions owing to three hydroxyl groups that
have similar reactivity. Therefore, the development of robust nano-
sized bifunctional catalysts is necessary for practical glycerol
oxidation. Moreover, the use of bifunctional catalysts for biodiesel
production as well as for subsequent glycerol conversion will improve
process efficiency and economics.

Lactic acid is produced mainly by anaerobic conversion of sugars
with fermentation [469]. Lactic acid can also be produced by Lewis
acid–mediated catalytic processes involving successive hydrolysis
of polysaccharides to glucose, glucose-to-fructose isomerization,
retro-aldol fragmentation to trioses (i.e., dihydroxyacetone and glyc-
eraldehydes), and dehydration and 1,2-hydride shift reactions
[470,471]. In an aerobic process, the catalytic dehydrogenation of
sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and erythritol to lactic acid can be achieved
with a series of Ir—NHC complexes under basic conditions, afford-
ing a maximum lactic acid yield of ~50% (Table 5, Entries 37–40)
[460]. Catalytic dehydrogenation of mannitol and xylitol, mannose
and xylose gives similar oxidized product mixtures as those of sor-
bitol aerobic transformation; base-driven isomerization and
dehydration of simple sugars account for the catalyst selectivity. In
light of these observations, it has been speculated that the conver-
sion of sorbitol to lactic acid occurs as shown in Fig. 24 [460]. Initially,

iridium-catalyzed dehydrogenation of sorbitol to a tautomeric
mixture containing glucose, fructose and galtose occurs under basic
conditions (KOH—H2O) [472], followed by a retro-aldol condensa-
tion, cleaving C—C bonds, to form two different C3 molecules

depending on the type of C6 sugar. Dihydroxyacetone and glycer-
aldehyde from fructose could act as direct precursors to lactate via
an intramolecular Cannizzaro reaction (Table 5, Entries 41–45)
[461,462]. In the case of glucose, two potential enol molecules formed

via dehydration lead to totally different products, in which the
2-hydroxy enol is converted to a 1,2-di-ketone, followed by cleav-
age to yield two C3 molecules that both are then converted to lactic
acid, while the 3-hydroxy enol results in the formation of C2 and
C4 products (Table 5, Entry 46) [463,473]. Thus, suppressing the for-
mation of 3-hydroxy enol by adjusting acidity/basicity of reaction
solution or solid support is helpful to increase the selectivity of lactic
acid.

In the catalytic conversion of carbohydrates to organic acids, the
synergistic effect of metal and acid–base sites seems to be a major
factor that affects product selectivity. In some cases, sugars can be
efficiently converted to the desired molecules, however, appropri-
ate control of the functionalities of the catalytic materials still needs
research for application in practical biorefineries.

4.1.2. Oxidation of HMF and furfural
4.1.2.1. 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Furanic compounds bearing
oxygenated groups such as —CHO and —COOR (R: H, CH3, CnH2n+1)
derived from biomass derivatives are expected to replace fuels and
chemicals presently being produced from fossil fuels. FDCA,
generated from selective oxidation of HMF, is a monomer for

furan-containing polymers and materials that has special proper-
ties [474–479]. Several oxidants such as H2O2, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-
piperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO), and classical metal oxides containing
chromium or manganese can be used although toxicity and waste
treatment issues exist [480–482]. Thus, the use of dioxygen as
oxidant with the only byproduct being water is a current research
topic with the goal to convert HMF into FDCA via oxidation (Table 6).
Under alkaline conditions, carbon-supported ruthenium is re-
ported to be an active catalyst for HMF-to-FDCA conversion, but it
is associated with low stability (Table 6, Entries 1–3) [483,484]. Ru-
thenium on different magnesium-based supports including
magnesium oxide, spinel, and HT show superior catalytic perfor-
mance for the selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA [485], as compared
with other solid supports such as titanium-, aluminum-, cerium-,
zirconium-, and lanthanum oxides, magnetite, and hydroxyapa-
tite (Table 6, Entries 4–11). Catalysts with high basicity generally
exhibit high efficiency for the HMF-to-FDCA oxidation in aqueous
media without adding free base, and FDCA yields higher than 90%
have been obtained (Table 6, Entries 4 and 6). In these reaction
systems (Table 6, Entries 4–11), a homogeneous alkaline mixture
is formed in the case of both HT and MgO supports by partial

Fig. 25. Proposed reaction pathway for aqueous HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural) aerobic oxidation. HMFCA: 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid, FFCA: 5-formyl-2-
furancarboxylic acid, FDCA: 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid. Adapted with permission from Ref. 488, Copyright © 2009 Wiley-VCH.

dissolution of Mg2+ ions under the reaction conditions, resulting in
the generation of Mg-FDCA salts that are stabilized against further
degradation. Among these salts, the spinel form remains stable and
allows the oxidation reaction to proceed under base-free condi-
tions [554]. By using ILs as the reaction solvent, Ståhlberg et al. [486]
found that Ru(OH)x on La2O3 support was suitable for oxidation in
IL 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][OAc]), affording
an FDCA yield of 48% (Table 6, Entry 12). In comparison with other
ILs such as [EMIM]Cl, [BMIM]Cl, [BMIM][PF6], [BMIM][BF4], and
[EMIM][HSO4], [EMIM][OAc] appears to possess a higher solubili-
ty for oxygen, but rapidly degrades HMF [555], which renders it to
be the best IL solvent among those studied for this catalytic process.
Besides ruthenium containing catalysts, gold particles sup-
ported on metal oxides are promising catalysts for oxidation
reactions. In the presence of a base promoter (e.g., NaOH or KOH),
the oxidation of aqueous HMF occurs with a commercial hetero-
geneous Au/TiO2 catalyst, giving an FDCA yield of 71% (Table 6, Entry
13) [487]. The Cannizzaro reaction along with favorable reaction con-
ditions for HMF degradation seems to be the reason why high the
FDCA yields are obtained. Compared with Au/TiO2, Au/Fe2O3 and Au/
C, Casanova et al. [488] found that Au/CeO2 displays a relatively
higher catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of HMF-to-FDCA
in water than other Au/supports and gives and a maximum FDCA
yield of 100% (Table 6, Entries 14–17). The nanoparticulate ceria
support with gold nanoparticles is possibly responsible for the ac-
celerated reaction rate, while the increased amount of Ce3+ from the
reductive pretreatment of Au/CeO2 catalyst probably enhances its
catalytic reactivity. The reaction mechanism proposed (Fig. 25), and
the alcohol oxidation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid
(HMFCA) to FDCA was speculated to be the rate-limiting step. In
the proposed reaction pathway (Fig. 25), HMFCA is initially formed
from HMF via rapid oxidation of the intermediate Hemiacetal 1,
while the oxidation of HMFCA to 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid
(FFCA) is slow, and then in situ generates the second hemiacetal in-
termediate (Hemiacetal 2), which is rapidly converted into FDCA.
Desorption of the acid product from the gold surface with a base
seems to be always required for the oxidation of HMF [556]. Then,
neutralization of the produced salts of carboxylic acid products with
a homogeneous base is necessary at the end of the reaction. In this
regard, solid base catalysts appear to be promising candidates for
the reaction. Gold supported on HT with moderate basicity facili-
tates the formation of FDCA that exceeds Au/TiO2, and 99% selectivity
of FDCA at HMF conversion of 100% is obtained at 90 °C in 20 h
(Table 6, Entry 18) [489]. Unfortunately, extensive leaching of mag-
nesium from HT results in the formation of a homogeneous basic
solution. By using the same catalyst Au/HT, Gupta et al. [490] de-
tected that gold species do not leach out of the HT support as
confirmed by ICP analysis, and the catalyst efficiently promotes HMF

oxidation to afford FDCA in an almost constant yield of >99%, 92%
and 90% for the first, second and third runs, respectively (Table 6,
Entry 19). To further enhance the reusability and stability of gold
nanoparticles, Pasini et al. [491] show that a relatively stronger syn-
ergistic effect in terms of sample stability and resistance to poisoning
is evident with the addition of copper to gold, compared with their
monometallic analogs (Table 6, Entries 20–23). Moreover, bimetal-
lic gold–copper nanoparticles supported on TiO2 are more active for
the oxidation of HMF to FDCA than Au/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2, which might
be the result of gold site isolation caused by alloying. The stabili-
zation effect and catalytic performance of the alloy are strongly
related to the amount of copper, and the highest level of reusabil-
ity and the best catalytic activity are obtained with the bimetallic
system of 1.5 wt% AuCu/TiO2 at Au/Cu atomic ratios of 1 and 3, re-
spectively [557]. Significant synergistic effects have been observed
between two alloyed metals for the base-free oxidation of HMF to
FDCA in AuPd/CNT (carbon nanotube; Table 6, Entries 24–26) [492]
and AuCu/CeO2 (Table 6, Entries 27 and 28) [493].

Both catalyst site basicity and type of oxidant are important to
selectively and efficiently oxidize HMF to FDCA. The roles of added
base and molecular oxygen in the formation of FDCA from HMF with
Pt/C or Au/TiO2 catalyst have been investigated through labeling ex-
periments with 18O2 and H2
18O [558] (Fig. 26): (1) initial nucleophilic
addition of a hydroxide ion to the carbonyl group with the subse-
quent proton transfer from water gives a geminal diol; (2) the
carboxylic acid formed from dehydrogenation of the geminal diol
intermediate is facilitated by the hydroxide ions adsorbed onto the
metal surface; (3) the hydroxide ions further assist the activation
of C—H bond of the alcohol side-chain to afford HMFCA (aldehyde
intermediate); (4 and 5) the aldehyde side-chain of HMFCA is oxi-
dized to produce FDCA, analogous to the oxidation of HMF to HMFCA
in steps (1) and (2). Molecular oxygen is proposed to scavenge the
electrons deposited into the metal particles so as to close the cata-
lytic cycle, preferable to directly participating in oxidation or
dehydrogenation steps. Under identical conditions, platinum par-
ticles show higher selectivity for FDCA during HMF oxidation than
gold, which might be attributed to the platinum being able to ac-
tivate the geminal hydrogen atoms of alcohol. Comparison of the
rate and product distribution in the oxidation of HMF to FDCA over
Pt/C, Pd/C, Au/C and Au/TiO2 shows the reactivity of platinum, pal-
ladium and gold particles (Table 6, Entries 29–32) [494] for which
the rate of HMF oxidation to the intermediate HFCA with gold cat-
alyst is an order of magnitude higher than that with either platinum
or palladium catalyst, while FDCA is directly formed by further ox-
idation of HFCA over platinum, palladium except gold particles. For
Au/TiO2, the formation of FDCA from HFCA is realized under rela-
tively higher O2 partial pressures (ca. 2000 or 3000 kPa) and base
concentrations (ca. 2.0 M) in which the base concentration has a

18O) in the presence of dioxygen (18O2), excess base (OH−) and either

stronger effect on the reaction than the O2 partial pressure [494].
For example, the selectivity for FDCA over Au/TiO2 increases from
3% to 28% when O2 partial pressure is increased from 690 to 2000 kPa
at 50% HMF conversion in 0.3 M NaOH solution, while 80% FDCA
selectivity and 100% HMF conversion are achieved in the presence
of 2 M NaOH under 2000 kPa O2 partial pressure.

Saha et al. [495] aerobically oxidized HMF in acetic acid (HOAc)
with Co(OAc)2/Zn(OAc)2/Br− homogeneous catalyst, but 2,5-
diformylfuran (DFF) is the only oxidation product with high yield
(ca. 96%) (Table 6, Entry 33). When 1 wt% trifluoroacetic acid (HTFA)
is added together with HOAc as acid additive, HMF is directly oxi-
dized to FDCA with a maximum yield of 60% and FFCA (29% yield)
(Table 6, Entry 34). Supported catalysts Au/TiO2 and Au/CeO2 improve
HMF conversions from 62% to 84% and 29% to 83%, respectively, with
corresponding FFCA yields increasing from 45% to 79% and 17% to
71% in the absence and presence of 1 wt% HTFA (Table 6, Entries
35–38). Among these Au/support catalysts, Au/TiO2 has a higher gold
content and BET surface area than Au/CeO2, which probably con-
tributes to its higher catalytic activity.

Lilga et al. [496] investigated the effect of basic, neutral, and acidic
feeds on HMF oxidation. FDCA has low solubility in water (0.086
wt% at 25 °C), but has moderate solubility in carboxylic acid sol-
vents (e.g., for aqueous 40 vol% acetic acid, FDCA solubility is 0.153
wt% at 25 °C). In acidic solutions, DFF is the preferred product with
about 70% selectivity over Pt/ZrO2 at 100 °C using air as oxidant
(Table 6, Entry 39). By increasing the temperature from 100 to 140 °C
and introducing O2 instead of air, HMF conversion rises to 100% and
FDCA selectivity increases to 85% (Table 6, Entry 40). With basic

solutions, high yields of FDCA, fast rates, and good product solu-
bilities are attained (Table 6, Entry 41), while reactions in neutral
solutions are slower and generally produce both DFF and FDCA
(Table 6, Entry 42). The product distribution of HMF oxidation can
be controlled to some extent by adjusting the acid–base proper-
ties of the reaction solution, which is possibly useful in practical
processes.

Kröger et al. [497] converted fructose directly into FDCA in a two-
phase system composed of water and MIBK, in which a microporous
cationic ion exchanger in H+ form (Lewatit SPC 108) catalyzes the
dehydration of fructose to HMF in the aqueous phase and a sub-
sequent oxidation reaction occurs in the MIBK phase with a MIBK-
modified PtBi/C catalyst encapsulated in silicone beads. With this
catalytic system, a moderate FDCA yield of 25% is obtained at 80 °C
at the end of the in situ oxidation process (Table 6, Entry 43). A bi-
functional acidic and redox catalyst prepared by encapsulation of
cobalt acetylacetonate into a sol–gel silica matrix is highly effi-
cient for direct fructose-to-FDCA conversion (Table 6, Entry 44) [498].
Extraction purification [559] in a triphasic system consisting of tet-
raethylammonium bromide (TEAB) or water–MIBK–water [560]
allows an integrated process for cascade dehydration and oxida-
tion of fructose in a single pot, affording an overall FDCA yields of
83% and 78%, respectively, for those solvent systems.

A few other catalytic systems have been proposed for the se-
lective oxidation of HMF to FDCA. A highly cross-linked and thermally
stable Fe3+-porous organic polymer (Fe3+-POP-1) containing basic por-
phyrin subunits and iron metal center is an efficient heterogeneous
catalyst for HMF oxidation, and a FDCA yield of 79% at HMF

conversion of 100% is obtained (Table 6, Entry 45) [499]. Merrifield
resin supported Co(II)–meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)-porphyrin with tert-
butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant converts 96% HMF to yield 90% FDCA
(Table 6, Entry 46) [500]. Pd nanoparticles stabilized by PVP (poly-
vinyl pyrrolidone; Table 6, Entry 47) [501], Pt/γ-Al2O3 (Table 6, Entry
48) [502], Li2CoMn3O8 (Table 6, Entry 49) [503], Pt/TiO2 and Pt/
ZrO2 (Table 6, Entries 50 and 51) [504] afford FDCA in high yields
from HMF. The properties of the supports affect both reactivity and
stability of the metal nanoparticles in a direct way. In an external
magnetic field, solid catalysts being paramagnetic and oxidizable,
such as nano-Fe3O4—CoOx, γ-Fe2O3@HAP—Pd and Pd/C@Fe3O4, are
stable, magnetically separable, and active for HMF-to-FDCA oxida-
tion (Table 6, Entries 52–54) [505–507].

4.1.2.2. 2,5-Diformylfuran (DFF). Synthesis of DFF from the oxida-
tion of the primary hydroxyl group in HMF without affecting the
more reactive α,β-unsaturated aldehyde group is a challenging route
for fabricating macrocyclic ligands, pharmaceuticals, and function-
al materials [561–563]. One of the first representative studies on
the aerobic oxidation of HMF to DFF used homogeneous metal/
bromide catalysts (Co/Mn/Br and Co/Mn/Zr/Br) and was reported
by Partenheimer and Grushin (Table 6, Entries 55 and 56) [508].
When copper and vanadium immobilized in poly(4-vinylpyridine)
are crosslinked with 33% divinylbenzene (DVB) or supported on
organofunctionalized SBA-15 mesoporous materials, relatively higher
activity and better chemoselectivity were observed, as compared
with the corresponding homogeneous catalysts (Table 6, Entries 57–
62) [509]. Among these heterogeneous catalysts, vanadium-
containing polymeric catalysts are more active than their copper
analogs and afford DFF selectivities greater than 99% for 82% HMF
conversions (Table 6, Entry 61). However, metal leaching occurs
during the reaction. In contrast, SBA-15 mesoporous silica immo-
bilized pyridine-VO(acac)2 is able to avoid metal leaching, but its
catalytic activity is far lower, with a maximum DFF selectivity of
98% at HMF conversion of 50% (Table 6, Entry 62). To further improve
the reactivity of vanadium catalysts, partial substitution of VO3+ with
different metal cations (Fe3+, Cr3+, Ga3+, Mg2+, Cu2+ and Pd2+) can be
used (Table 6, Entries 63–68) [510], however, no significant im-
provement in the catalytic performance is observed. Different metal
oxide supports including TiO2, Al2O3, Nb2O5, ZrO2, and MgO have been
employed to immobilize VOx catalysts at varying VOx surface den-
sities (Table 6, Entries 69–73) [511], and the support surfaces covered
with acidity, polyvanadates and V2O5 clusters are demonstrated to
favor the formation of DFF. V2O5 clusters appear to show superior
activity to VO3+ species in the oxidation of HMF to DFF, and both
catalytic systems are likely to be promoted by acidic supports.

The influence of supports, solvents, and metal oxidation states
on the activity and DFF selectivity of ruthenium catalysts has been
examined to understand structural requirements of immobilized
metal catalysts [512]. Solid supports including activated carbon,
typical solid bases Mg2AlOx and MgO, solid acids Al2O3 and ZSM-5,
and amphoteric and redox oxides TiO2, CeO2, and ZrO2 have been
adopted to support Ru (Table 6, Entries 74–81). The weak acidity
and basicity in the supports promote DFF formation, and in particular,

activated carbon supported Ru shows superior reactivity in the syn-
thesis of DFF from HMF.

The effect of toluene, benzotrifluoride, 1,4-dioxane, H2O, DMSO
and N,N-dimethylformamide solvents on HMF-to-DFF conversion
for of Ru/C catalyst has been studied (Table 6, Entries 82–86) [512].
Among the solvents, benzotrifluoride has comparable activity with
toluene (79.4 h−1 vs. 61.2 h−1) for almost the same DFF selectivity (95
%). In 1,4-dioxane solvent, Ru/C catalyst has high activity (74.8 h−1)
but low DFF selectivity (40 %), while water has a higher activity
(160.7 h−1) with moderate DFF selectivity (84%). Solvents N,N-
dimethylformamide and DMSO exhibit poor activities of 4.4 and
1.9 h−1, respectively. The Ru0 species on Ru/C (61.2 h−1) is more active
for HMF oxidation than that on RuOx/C (48.9 h−1) and RuCl3/C
(29.3 h−1) under identical conditions, and DFF selectivities of ~96%
are achieved over Ru/C [512]. Ru/C characterized by XPS (X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy) shows the dominant presence of metallic
Ru0 particles with no essential change (76.5% vs. 75.6% Ru0) before
and after the oxidation of HMF, demonstrating the Ru/C catalyst is
stable and recyclable under the reaction conditions.

It is desirable to replace a two-step process that produces DFF
from carbohydrates through sequential dehydration and oxida-
tion reactions with a one-step process [564]. Xiang et al. [513]
developed a one-pot, one-step approach for direct conversion of
glucose to DFF with a catalytic system consisting of CrCl3·6H2O/
NaBr//NaVO3·2H2O. The two-step process gives higher DFF yields
(55%; Table 6, Entry 87) than the one-step process (18%). Yang et
al. [514] examined the direct synthesis of DFF from fructose by suc-
cessively using a solid acid Fe3O4—SBA—SO3H and an oxygenant
K—OMS-2 (H0.2K0.8Mn8O16·nH2O, octahedral molecular sieve) in a
single pot. Both catalytic processes are complementary to each other,
in which Fe3O4—SBA—SO3H is able to dehydrate fructose to HMF with
a yield of 81%, while K—OMS-2 promotes the successive oxidation
of HMF to produce DFF with a 99% yield and 100% selectivity (Table 6,
Entry 88). The catalytic system when used for the transformation
of glucose and inulin to DFF gives low to moderate DFF yields
(Table 6, Entries 89 and 90). When a combination of HT, Amberlyst-
15, and Ru/HT catalysts via stepwise addition was used for the
successive isomerization, dehydration, and selective oxidation in one
pot (Fig. 27), an improved DFF yield of 25% is obtained from glucose
(Table 6, Entry 91) [515].

Several approaches to simplify the catalytic system for synthe-
sis of DFF deserve to be mentioned. Impregnation of silver in
K—OMS-2 not only improves the activity by increasing the concen-
tration of basic sites and decreasing acidic sites, but also lowers the
required temperature of the reaction [516] (Table 6, Entry 92). Ru-
thenium supported on activated carbon (Ru/C) efficiently catalyzes
the oxidation of HMF to DFF with high selectivity and the product
distribution can be varied by adding water and HT, giving either FFCA
or FDCA as the dominant product (Table 6, Entries 93–96) [517]. Pro-
motion effects by Cu(NO3)2 on VOSO4-catalyzed aerobic oxidation
for transforming HMF to DFF in acetonitrile reveals that the acti-
vation of VOSO4 occurs to generate active V5+ species that effectively
inhibit the oxidative C—C bond cleavage of HMF and suppresses
radical reactions of DFF that form humins (Table 6, Entry 97) [518].

As vanadyl (VO2+) and cupric (Cu2+) are immobilized on sulfonated
carbon, the resulting catalyst with 0.93% V and 0.26% Cu exhibits
the best performance (Table 6, Entry 98) among catalysts in this
group (Table 6, Entries 97 and 98) [519]. The trimetallic mixed oxide

catalysts (Table 6, Entry 102) [523], protonated graphitic carbon

on activated carbon (V2O5/AC), polymers and zeolites (V2O5/
zeolite; Table 6, Entries 104–106) [525–527], N-hydroxyphthalimide/
Cu(NO3)2 (Table 6, Entry 107) [528], 1-hydroxybenzotriazole/
copper(I) iodate (Table 6, Entry 108) [529], ruthenium complex
immobilized on poly(4-vinylpyridine)-functionalized carbon-
nanotube (Table 6, Entry 109) [530], ruthenium clusters supported
on covalent triazine frameworks (Table 6, Entry 110) [531], 5 wt%
Pd-V(3:2)@MIL-101 (Table 6, Entry 111) [532], and even HBr/
DMSO or NaBr/DMSO (Table 6, Entry 112) [533] are efficient for the
synthesis of DFF from HMF or sugars. A series of magnetically re-
cyclable catalysts including Mn3O4 (Table 6, Entry 113) [534], TEMPO
(Table 6, Entry 114) [535], and ruthenium (Table 6, Entries 115 and
116) [536,537] supported on Fe3O4 nanoparticles are active for
aerobic oxidation of HMF into DFF with many yields shown being
more than 80%. As a common characteristic, redox sites as well as
the promoting sub-units such as acidity/basicity, reaction media,
catalyst structure and texture are involved in these catalytic systems,
thus, synergistic actions may be present in the oxidative processes.

4.1.2.3. Maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride (MA), which is pro-
duced via selective oxidation of petroleum-based feedstocks at high
temperatures (e.g., 400 °C), is a versatile intermediate for 1,4-
butanediol, fumaric acid, unsaturated polyester resins, and THF
[565–567]. Du et al. [538] explored a potential route to prepare MA
from biomass derivatives using VO(acac)2 in acetonitrile and found
that HMF is mainly oxidized into DFF (Fig. 28, Route a) and the MA
yield can be significantly enhanced by increasing oxygen partial pres-
sure (Table 6, Entries 117 and 118). The C—C bond adjacent to the
hydroxymethyl group is easily broken and apparently, the second

α-hydroxy ketone forms on the other side via resonance and is oxi-
dized to MA as the dominant product (Fig. 28, Route b). Although
DFF is stable against further oxidation into FDCA or MA, the HMF
can react with HCOOH formed in Route b, giving the methyl ester.
In acetonitrile/acetic acid solvent, control experiments with
vanadium-substituted HPA H5PV2Mo10O40·xH2O catalyst reveal that
DFF, FFCA, FDCA and HMFCA do not appear in the pathway of MA
formation (Table 6, Entry 119), despite some of these being iden-
tified in product analyses [539]. Thereby, the oxidation is verified
to be initiated by the C—C bond cleavage between the furan and
hydroxymethyl group of HMF.

Furfural can be used instead of HMF as the starting material to form
MA via homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. For instance, Yin et
al. [540,541] reported that copper(II) nitrate in combination with phos-
phomolybdic acid or H3PMo12O40·xH2O affords MA with around 50%
yields from aerobic oxidation (Table 6, Entries 120 and 121). In the dom-
inant oxidation pathway, the abstraction of hydrogen from the 5-position
of furfural initiates the reaction and subsequently yields MA and
5-acetoxyl-2(5H)-furanone [568]. Alonso-Fagfflndez et al. [542] used
VOx/Al2O3 solid catalyst for upgrading furfural by selective gas phase
oxidation to obtain MA in 73% yield for 100% furfural conversion (Table 6,
Entry 122). In the oxidative upgrading process, furfural is oxidized suc-
cessively to furan and 2-furanone that is followed by rapid oxidative
dehydration to give MA (Fig. 29). Relatively high MA yields are ob-
tained from furfural using H2O2 as oxidant and titanium silicalite (TS-
1) as catalyst (Table 6, Entries 123 and 124) [543]. Ghaznavi et al. [544]
used a catalytic process at high temperatures to atomize a xylose–
water solution into a capillary fluidized bed containing vanadyl
pyrophosphate catalyst. Compared with molybdenum trioxide–
cobalt oxide and iron molybdate, vanadyl pyrophosphate exhibits
relatively higher activity (Table 6, Entries 125–127). The surface density
of vanadium and molybdenum along with characteristics of the sup-
ports probably affect the electronic properties and catalytic properties
of the supported metallic species.

4.1.3. Oxidation of biomass derivatives to other oxygenates
4.1.3.1. 2,5-Dimethylfuroate (FDMC) and methyl furoate (MFA). An
analog to FDCA is 2,5-dimethylfuroate (FDMC), which can be

synthesized from HMF dissolved in methanol via oxidation–
esterification in the presence of Au/TiO2 catalyst aided by CH3ONa
(Table 6, Entry 128) [545]. The possible reaction route involves initial
oxidation of the aldehyde moiety of HMF to yield 5-hydroxymethyl
methylfuroate (HMMF) in a high yield of ca. 90% under mild con-
ditions (0.1 MPa O2, 22 °C and 1.5 h), and then formation of methyl
5-formyl-2-furoate (MFF) by oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group
to the aldehyde, followed by the same oxidation–esterification
process to afford FDMC with 98% yield at a high temperature of
130 °C and 0.4 MPa in 3 h (Fig. 30) Methyl furoate (MFA), which is
used in flavors and fragrances, can be produced from furfural through
the same catalytic process (Fig. 30).

Nanoparticulate CeO2 is able to adsorb oxygen due to its large
number oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the Lewis acid character of non-
fully saturated cerium atoms is favorable for alcohol oxidation and
stabilization of positive metal particles. Casanova et al. [569] em-
ployed Au/CeO2 solely as catalyst without base additive for the
synthesis of FDMC and MFA to obtain >99% selectivity for FDMC from
HMF with >99% conversion, as well as 91% selectivity of MFA for
furfural at a conversion of >99% (Table 6, Entries 129 and 130). Ca-
sanova et al. [569] proposed a reaction network (Fig. 31): both
compounds 2 and 3 are derived from the same hemiacetal inter-
mediate 1 though successively dominant oxidation and subordinate
acetalization reaction to provide compound 4 in two separate path-
ways, and the resulting monoester acetal is further oxidized into
the diester FDMC. When Au/ZrO2 is employed as catalyst, oxida-
tive esterification of furfural proceeds under mild conditions, giving
almost complete selectivity to methyl-2-furoate, while oxygen partial
pressures lower than 0.1 MPa do not significantly affect the cata-
lytic performance for either system (Table 6, Entries 131–133) [546].
Catalytic activities for the oxidative esterification of furfural and HMF
have the following trends: Au/ZrO2 > Au/CeO2 ⪢ Au/TiO2, for which
the surface area of the supports and surface sites (e.g., 2 wt% nominal
sulfate content) separately affect conversions and the selectivities
(Table 6, Entries 134–139) [547,548].

4.1.3.2. FDCA-, DFF- and PBF-based polymers. FDCA- and DFF-
based polymers can be synthesized from HMF or furfural via
multistep reactions [570]. Pan et al. [570] prepared poly(butylene
2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PBF) starting from furfural through a four-
step synthetic sequence including nanoscale CuO catalyzed oxidation
of furfural into furoate (93% yield); catalytic disproportionation of
furoate to furan and FDCA (86% selectivity) with ZnCl2; and poly-
merization of FDCA with 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO), which was pre-
synthesized with 70% selectivity through hydrogenation and
hydrolysis of furan over Re—Ru/C, to produce polyester PBF with
total carbon utilization of furfural (Fig. 32). Several other related syn-
thetic routes have been put forward based on FDCA. For example,
the catalytic polytransesterification of FDCA with ethylene glycol
(EG) and 1,4-butylene glycol (BG) affords furan-based copolyesters
using Ti(OC4H9)4 as catalyst [571]. Polyethylene furandicarboxylate
(PEF) formed via the polymerization of FDCA with EG is a promising
candidate to replace fossil fuel–derived polyethylene terephthal-
ate (PET) [572], especially since the synthesis of poly(2,5-furan
dicarboxylate)s has been realized from diols [573].

Besides FDCA, DFF as a partially oxygenated compound with two
aldehyde groups also shows great potential in production of bio-
polymers. A series of porous furan-based organic frameworks (FOF)
have been prepared by condensation of DFF with diamines through
the formation of imine linkages without the presence of catalyst
[574]. The condensation of monomer DFF with urea at 110 °C by
melting a solid mixture can give a crystalline polymer resin in 90%
yield [575].

4.1.3.3. Succinic acid and 3-hydroxypropanoic acid from levulinic
acid. Levulinate derivatives are readily produced from lignocellu-
losic carbohydrates. Podolean et al. [549] found that Ru-based
magnetic nanoparticles are efficient for the oxidation of LA to suc-
cinic acid (96% selectivity) (Table 6, Entry 140), in which strong
Bronsted acid sites are responsible for catalyzing the oxidation of
the carbon backbone of LA via a Baeyer–Villiger (BV) mechanism.

Choudhary et al. [550] demonstrated that the use of a strong
Bronsted acid Amberlyst-15 and 30% aqueous H2O2 catalyzes the
oxidation of LA to SA (Table 6, Entry 141). By changing the solvent
from water to methanol, Wang et al. [551] found that selectivities
to methyl succinate and methyl acetate of around 60 and 40%, re-
spectively, are obtained from methyl levulinate (ML) in aqueous H2O2

with strong Bronsted acids like p-TsOH, MeSO3H, H2SO4, TfOH, and
Amberlyst-15 (Table 6, Entries 142–149). Lewis acidic triflate salts
are active for the oxidation of ML, and the metal cation influences
the reaction selectivity. The succinate/acetate ratio decreases from
1.6 to 0.3 as the solvent is switched from methanol to heptane, and
the higher degree of branching in the carbon backbone caused by

methanol is thought to result in a high molar ratio of methyl suc-
cinate and acetate (up to 1.6:1) Either —CH3 or —CH2CH2COOH,
migration in the oxidation of LA occurs such that the dominant
product can be selectively fixed to SA or 3-hydroxypropanoic acid
(Table 6, Entries 150 and 151) [552], as illustrated in Fig. 33. Under
acidic conditions in 30% aqueous H2O2, direct treatment of LA gives
predominantly SA [553], while 3-hydroxypropanoic acid is ob-
tained from LA via an intermediate 3-(hydroperoxy)propanoic acid
under basic conditions proceeds through a two-step catalytic process
involving partial oxidation with H2O2 at 0 °C to room temperature
and subsequent hydrogenation reaction over Pd/C [552]. The proper
adjustment of pH appears to be a key factor in controlling the product
distribution, even though conditions of the catalytic system must
be chosen to suppress the formation of byproducts.

4.1.3.4. a-Conidendrin (Coni) and a-conidendric acid (ConiA) from
lignans. Lignans, which are a group of phenolic compounds pos-
sessing anti-carcinogenic and anti-oxidative properties, can be
applied to cosmetic and pharmaceutical products [576]. Among these
phenolic chemicals, oxomatairesinol (oxoMAT) can be synthe-
sized from hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) via oxidation of its secondary
alcohol group over supported palladium and gold catalysts
[577–579]. Both isomers HMR 1 and HMR 2 can be oxidized to
oxoMAT with the major contaminants of α-conidendrin (Coni) and
α-conidendric acid (ConiA) over Au/Al2O3 catalysts in a basic solu-
tion at 70 °C and atmospheric pressure (Fig. 34) [580]. The maximum
activity of supported gold catalysts corresponds to an Au particle
diameter of 4 nm. In addition to the acid–base properties of solid
supports and reaction media, the morphological structures of metal
particles, such as degree of dispersion and particle size, affect the
performance of the bifunctional materials.

Lignin, which is a complex aromatic polymer that is widely-
dispersed in nature, has great potential for producing engineering
plastics and thermoplastic elastomers, low-cost carbon fibers, fun-
gible fuels, polymeric foams, and commodity chemicals [581].
Hydrothermal gasification, wet oxidation and hydrothermal lique-
faction convert lignin to fuel gas, aromatic aldehydes and phenolic
products, respectively [582–584], while integrated pretreatment with
subsequent valorization is necessary for developing lignin-to-
bioproduct processes [585–589]. One-pot catalytic oxidation of

biomass with bifunctional solid materials has the potential to sim-
plify pretreatment, intermediate separation, and post-treatment steps
required for producing chemical products. However, only a limited
number of one-pot oxidation examples have been reported, indi-
cating the infancy of this topic in the field. Nevertheless, increasing
research into bifunctional solid catalytic systems is certain to allow
clear examples to be developed in the near future.

4.2. Production of hydrogenates

Catalytic dehydration, esterification, etherification and
acetalization over functional materials are used to convert sugars,
glycerol, LA, furans and fatty acids into fuel additives, whereas
biomass-derived liquid hydrocarbon fuels are obtained by combin-
ing oxygen removal processes such as hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation
and decarbonylation with C—C coupling reactions including aldol
condensation, hydroxyalkylation, oligomerization and ketonization
to adjust the molecular weight of platform molecules [590,591]. In
this section, an overview of catalytic processes that use deoxygen-
ation of biomass derivatives is presented and bifunctional material-
mediated reaction pathways are emphasized.

4.2.1. Hydrolysis–hydrogenation of bio-polymers to polyols

Hexitols, which are considered as important platform chemi-
cals for the production of H2, liquid alkanes, and value-added
chemicals such as sorbitan, isosorbide, glycerol and lactic acid, can
be derived from polysaccharides [592–594]. Pretreatment/hydrolysis
steps are generally required to overcome the recalcitrance of lig-
nocelluloses, for which bifunctional catalytic systems have shown
great promise in the successive hydrolysis–hydrogenation reac-
tions to afford sorbitol and mannitol (Fig. 35) [595]. In an acidic
solution (pH = 2), Ru nanoclusters promote quantitative produc-
tion of sorbitol (100% yield) from cellobiose at 120 °C and 4 MPa
H2 partial pressure, while low yields of sorbitol are obtained under
neutral or basic conditions (pH = 7 or 10; Table 7, Entries 1–3) [596].
The direct conversion of cellobiose into sorbitol under a hydrogen
atmosphere has been achieved with acid-modified carbon nanotube
(CNT)-supported ruthenium catalysts in neutral water (Table 7, Entry
4) [597]. The presence of H2O in Ru/CNT renders the formation of
oxygen-containing groups and uniform defects on the tube-walls,

resulting in the highly stable and dispersed Ru nanoparticles, as well
as higher yields of sugar alcohols (39%) and conversion of cellobi-
ose (74%) than Ru/CNT without water (21% and 29%, respectively;
Table 7, Entries 5–8) [598,599].

If the substrate is changed from cellobiose to cellulose, carbon-
supported Ru clusters together with in-situ generated [H+] ions in
hot water afford hexitols with a sorbitol/mannitol molar ratio of
about 3.6/1 in a yield of 22% at 39% conversion under 6 MPa H2 partial
pressure at 245 °C in 5 min (Table 7, Entries 9 and 10) [600]. The
catalytic performance of ZrP combined with commercial 5% Ru/C
in hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose to sorbitol/mannitol has been
evaluated, and maximum sorbitol/mannitol yields of 62% and 81%
are obtained from microcrystalline and ball-milled cellulose, re-
spectively (Table 7, Entry 11) [601]. Both the adsorbed hydrogen
species concentrations and the acidic functional groups on the
support surfaces affect the sorbitol formation [629,630]. A great
number of ruthenium-based catalysts have been studied for this re-
action. In particular, a sorbitol yield of 71% could be achieved from
cellulose with Ru nanoparticles on carbon treated with sulfuric acid
(Ru/AC—SO3H) in a neutral aqueous solution (Table 7, Entry 12) [602].
Other bifunctional catalysts such as Keggin-type polyoxometalates
loaded with ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru/Cs2HPW12O40 and Ru/
[Bmim]3PW12O40; Table 7, Entries 13 and 14) [603,604], ruthenium
supported on a Beta and Y zeolite (Ru/Beta and Ru/Y; Table 7, Entries
15–17) [605,606], mesoporous niobium phosphate (Ru/NbOPO4;
Table 7, Entry 18) [607] and arenesulfonic acid functionalized
mesoporous silica (Ru/SBA—15-SO3H; Table 7, Entry 19) [608], and
Bronsted acid-promoted ruthenium catalysts (e.g., Ru/C + MCM-
41—SO3H or ZrP; Table 7, Entries 20–22) [609,610], as well as PTA/
metal-organic-framework-hybrid immobilized ruthenium catalyst
(Ru—PTA/MIL-100(Cr); Table 7, Entry 23) [611] are efficient for the
sequential hydrolysis and hydrogenation of cellulose into sorbitol
in neutral water under a hydrogen atmosphere. When the molar
ratio of acid sites to the number of Ru surface atoms (e.g., 8.84–
12.90) [611] has sufficient density, hexitol yields reach a maximum
from di- and polysaccharide (e.g., cellobiose and cellulose) substrates.

Apart from Ru nanoparticles, some other supported metal
nanoparticles such as Pt and Ni efficiently convert cellobiose and
cellulose into sugar alcohols. Comparable yields of sugar alcohols
(~25%) are obtained over γ-Al2O3 supported Pt catalyst (Table 7, Entry
24) [612], while the acid sites for the hydrolysis of cellulose are gen-
erated in-situ from H2 [631]. To enhance the affinity between
cellulose and catalyst, a fibrous three-dimensional (3D) carbon ma-
terial mimicking the shape of a sea urchin (Echinometra mathae) has
been used to support Pt particles [613]. The resulting catalyst is very
active for the hydrolysis of cellulose even though the support was
not treated with [H+] species, affording hexitols in a total yield of
~80% (Table 7, Entry 25). Instead of hydrogen gas, the combined use
of carbon monoxide (CO)/H2O as a hydrogen source with Pt—Mo2C/C
catalyst can promote the hydrolysis–hydrogenation of cellulose to
produce polyols in a yield of 42% with 60% selectivity to hexitols
(Table 7, Entry 26) [614]. In this catalytic process, the Pt—Mo2C
domains are responsible for the formation of active hydrogen species
from the water–gas shift reaction rather than from the C—C bond
cleavage reaction, while the Pt—C domains mainly catalyze the
succedent hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reaction. In contrast, Ni
nanoparticles on aluminum hydroxide (Ni/AlOH) are more stable
and active than pyrophoric Raney Ni in the two sequential reac-
tions, giving sugar alcohols in a total yield of 89% at a cellobiose
conversion of 90% (Table 7, Entries 27 and 28) [615]. The presence
of aluminum hydroxide causes a high dispersion of Ni metal species,
in particular, the NiNPs/AlOH catalyst is able to be reused at least
five consecutive cycles with almost no loss of activity (conversion
rate) with selectivity successively decreasing from 99 to 98% and
>99 to 98% for sucrose hydrogenolysis. Notably, nickel-based bi-
metals on activated carbon (AC) or mesoporous carbon (MC) exhibit
improved catalytic performance and stability in comparison with
isolated metals such as Ir and Ni (Table 7, Entries 29–38) [616], which
might be the result from tunable electronic and chemical proper-
ties of the bimetallic catalysts that are superior to those of the single
metal particles [632,633]. Ni-containing carbon nanofibers (Ni/
CNFs) synthesized through catalytic vapor deposition (CVD) of CH4

over Ni nanoclusters on γ-alumina afford a moderate yield of hexitols
(35%) from the degradation of microcrystalline cellulose with 87%
conversion (Table 7, Entry 39) [617]. Since Ni particles attach at the
tip of the inert CNF (carbon nanofiber), the metal sites in the porous
supports are fully accessible. Anchoring and dispersing Ni precur-
sors onto CNFs can be realized by the oxidative activation of the CNFs
with HNO3 [634–636], and the acid strength/concentration of Ni/
CNF-catalysts can be adjusted by tailoring the preparation methods
[618]. Among various CNF-supported Ni particles, the Ni/CNFs with
a catalyst loading of 7.5 wt % prepared by chemical vapor deposi-
tion of CH4 on a Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, followed by oxidation in HNO3
(twice for 1 h at 110 °C), incipient wetness impregnation, and re-
duction at 550 °C under a H2 atmosphere are highly active for the
hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose, affording a maximum hexitols
yield of 76% with 69% sorbitol selectivity and 93% cellulose con-
version (Table 7, Entries 40–43). Properly balanced Ni/CNF catalysts
in terms of Ni dispersion, hydrogenation capacity, and the number
of acidic surface–oxygen groups are likely to be responsible for the
enhanced activity in hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose to hexitols.
The cleavage of C—C bonds of saccharides is efficiently pro-
moted by tungsten-based catalysts, yielding EG rather than hexitols
as the dominant product in the sequential hydrolysis and
hydrogenolysis of cellulose (Fig. 36; Table 7, Entries 44–46)
[619,620,637]. Tungsten carbide (WCx) or tungsten phosphide (WP)
without adding transition metal particles has the capability to
produce EG directly from cellulose. In this catalytic process, [H+]

emerging from both hot H2O and the surface tungsten oxides or
phosphates act on cellulose hydrolysis, while WCx or WP with the
platinum-like electronic properties is responsible for the subse-
quent hydrogenation (Table 7, Entries 47–49) [621,622]. For the case
of a 3D mesoporous carbon (MC) supported WCx nanoparticles, the
3D interconnected mesoporous structure of MC support is able to
facilitate the accessibility/dispersion of active component WCx and
the transportation of molecules, thereby enhancing hydrogena-
tion activity [638] and gives an EG yield of 73% (Table 7, Entries 50–
52) [623]. In contrast, tungsten and tungsten oxide species (e.g., WO3,
W, insoluble H2WO4, soluble HxWO3 and HPAs) are only active for
C—C cleavage of cellulose, while an extra transition metal in the form
of M−W species is responsible for the subsequent hydrogenation
accessible to EG (Table 7, Entries 53–68) [624–627]. Xi et al. [628]
reported that NbOPO4 as a support and catalyst can accelerate the
cleavage of a C—C bond while supported Ru particles are respon-
sible for the further hydrogenation, so as to convert cellulose into
EG and EG monoether (EGME) in a total yield of 55% (Table 7, Entry
69). The dopant Ni rather than W, Sn and Cu is more effective for
the production of EG + EGME with a 64% total yield, which is prob-
ably because Ni can restrain the further hydrogenolysis of the
resulting products to byproducts such as CO and alkanes, while W,
Sn, and Cu are all able to promote degradation of EG and EGME
(Table 7, Entries 70–73). Therefore, appropriate combination of metal
species with acid sites is necessary for enhancing and controlling
the selectivity of polyols from carbohydrates involving multi-step

reactions such as hydrolysis, hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis, and C—C
bond cleavage.

4.2.2. Hydrodeoxygenation of biomass derivatives with HMF as an
intermediate

Variation of

reaction conditions and catalysts allows
DMF, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran (BHMTF), 2,5-
bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), DMTHF, and ring-opened products
like 5-hydroxy-2,5-hexanedione (HHD) to be selectively obtained
from HMF hydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 37. DMF, which has
a moderate boiling point (92–94 °C) and high energy den-
sity (31.5 MJ·L−1) is of high interest [639–641]. Using different sugars
as substrates, a series of catalytic systems efficient for the trans-
formation of biomass derivatives into DMF with HMF or
5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF) as an intermediate have been eluci-
dated [642,643].

4.2.2.1. 2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF). A two-step process involving the
dehydration of fructose to HMF catalyzed by HCl in H2O/2-butanol
(a biphasic system) and the succedent liquid phase hydrogenolysis
to DMF over Cu—Ru/C catalyst has been shown to give high cata-
lytic efficiency (up to 71% DMF yield; Table 8, Entry 1) [644].
Combination of fructose-to-HMF dehydration over a solid acid
Amberlyst-15 catalyst and subsequent hydrogenolysis to DMF over
Ru—Sn/ZnO catalyst efficiently produces DMF with an overall yield
of 92% with no leaching of the active sites as assessed with ICP-
AES analyses (Table 8, Entry 2) [645]. Starting from glucose,
Chidambaram and Bell [646] reported that HPAs such as 12-
molybdophosphoric acid (12-MPA) were extremely active for
dehydration of glucose in a mixed solution consisting of [EMIM][Cl]
and acetonitrile, producing approximately 100% yield of HMF after
3 h at 120 °C (Table 8, Entry 3), while carbon-supported metals such
as Pd/C catalyst in a second step could convert 44–47% HMF to DMF

Fig. 37. Major products in the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural). DMF: 2,5-dimethylfuran, DMTHF: 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran, BHMF: 2,5-
bis(hydroxymethyl)furan, HHD: 5-hydroxy-2,5-hexanedione.

in 1 h. The high selectivity of HMF catalyzed by HPAs is attributed
to the stabilization of reaction intermediates including 1,2-enediol,
isomerized 2,3-enediol, and the in-situ formed furylhydroxymethyl
ketone, while the presence of acetonitrile as a cosolvent inhibits the
formation of humins in both dehydration and subsequent hydro-
genation processes. With a THF/H2O—NaCl biphasic system in
combination with a dehydration process over Sn-Mont or NbOPO4
catalyst and a succedent hydrogenolysis over Ru/Co3O4 catalyst, DMF
and MF could be produced in high yields (>90%) from glucose/
xylose mixed substrates (Table 8, Entry 4) [647]. The in-situ
separation of the upper organic phase containing furfural and HMF
is an important step for obtaining enhanced yields of hydroge-
nated products.

A DMF yield of 98% from HMF (100% conversion within 10 min)
over PtCo bimetallic nanoparticles (3.6 ± 0.7 nm diameter) in 2 h can
be obtained without involving the catalytic step of sugar dehydra-
tion (Table 8, Entry 5) [648]. The small particle sizes and the stable
homogeneous alloying in the hollow carbon spheres probably con-
tribute to the high activity of the catalyst and the remarkable DMF
yield (Table 8, Entry 5). Well-dispersed metal sites, well-controlled
surface sites of solid supports, and optimized reaction conditions
can also provide enhanced catalytic reaction systems (Table 8, Entries
6–14) [641,649–656].

Instead of using H2 as H-donor, Thananatthanachon and Rauchfuss
[657] demonstrated that formic acid acts as an acid catalyst for
fructose-to-HMF dehydration and as a hydrogen source over a Pd/C
catalyst for HMF deoxygenation to produce DMF, resulting in a total
reaction efficiency of about 51% after diethyl ether extraction (Table 8,
Entry 15). The one-pot conversion of lignocellulosic and algal biomass
with a multicomponent catalytic system comprising [DMA]+[CH3SO3]−,
Ru/C and formic acid affords DMF in a maximum yield of 32%
(Table 8, Entries 16–18) [658]. For a possible reaction route,
5-(formyloxymethyl)furfural was shown by 1H and 13C NMR spectra
to be a key intermediate.

4.2.2.2. 2,5-bis(Hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHMTF). In the man-
ufacture of plastics, 1,6-hexanediol is used on a large scale and it is
derived from petroleum sources [671]. It is possible to produce 1,6-
hexanediol beginning from a biomass derivative BHMTF (Fig. 37).
However, that method requires high temperatures and high hydro-
gen pressures and large amounts of noble metal catalysts to obtain
BHMTF in high yields [672,673]. A series of Ni—Pd bimetallic par-
ticles supported on silica with various Ni/Pd molar ratios suitable
for the reaction have been prepared using a co-impregnation
technique [659]. The best catalytic performance in the total
hydrogenation of HMF to BHMTF (up to 96% yield) is for sup-
ported catalyst (NiPd/SiO2) with a Ni/Pd ratio of 7 that is more
selective than Pd/SiO2 and more active than commercial Raney Ni
(Table 8, Entries 19–21). Ruthenium supported on materials such
as ceria, magnesia-zirconia and γ-alumina with high isoelectric points
exhibits higher BHMTF yields of 88–91% than platinum and palla-
dium catalysts at the same catalyst weight percent of 1 wt% (Table 8,
Entries 22–26) [660]. The superior overall selectivity to BHMTF is
dependent not only on the high rates of hydrogenation (Ru > Pd)
other than C—C scission reactions promoted by Pt, but also on the
suitable solution acidity (pH = ~ 5) provided by solid supports or re-
action media. Starting from carbohydrates, Cai et al. [661] performed
the direct production of furan-based diols with yields of 34–89%
via one-pot tandem reactions so that the controllable production
of BHMF or BHMTF is realized by selecting the suitable support and
metal species in a two-step process (Table 8, Entries 27–32). After
checking various supported 5 wt% metal particles including Pd/C,
Ru/C, Ir/C, Ir/TiO2, Pt/C and Ni/C, the catalyst Ir/TiO2 affords >99% HMF
conversion with BHMF in 95% selectivity from fructose, in which
both Ir particles and the reductive support TiO2 favor C:O hydro-
genation. Under identical conditions, Pd/C provides BHMTF with 84%

selectivity at >99% conversion, which might be related to the
relatively higher specific rate of Pd in HMF hydrogenation
(Pd ≈ Ru > Ir > Pt > Ni). Instead of multi-step catalytic steps in a single
pot, a combination of acid (Amberlyst-15) and hydrophobic Ru/
SiO2-TM in a water/cyclohexane biphasic system can be used to
achieve one-step hydrogenation of fructose to produce BHMTH in
a maximum selectivity of 65% (Table 8, Entry 33), although the se-
lectivity toward BHMTH seems to be strongly dependent on the
acid catalyst used [662]. The selectivity of BHMTH increases in
2−/ZrO2 (~40%) < Nb2O5—P
the order of HY-zeolite (15%) < SO4
(~58%) < Amberlyst-15 (65%) < H2SO4 (75%), which is proportional-
ly to the Bronsted acidity. It appears that the strong acid sites are
prone to accelerate the dehydration of fructose to HMF, thus facili-
tating the subsequent hydrogenation process to yield BHMTH
without rehydration to LA.

4.2.2.3. 2,5-bis(Hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). BHMF, which is ob-
tained from the catalytic hydrogenation of the aldehyde in HMF, is
used in polymers, resin additives, and intermediates for drugs and
crown ethers [674,675]. Metal oxides supported gold with 1 wt%
Au loading prepared by deposition impregnation are active in the
hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF [663]. Among the catalysts (Table 8,
Entries 34–41), relatively high activity and selectivity toward BHMF
over Au/Al2O3 is obtained. For comparison, Au/La2O3 and Au/CeO2
are also selective in the production of BHMF but low reactivity is
observed (Table 8, Entries 35 and 36). Whereas, almost no BHMF
is produced from HMF catalyzed by those metal particles sup-
ported on acidic metal oxides including TiO2, ZrO2, Ta2O5, TiO2—SiO2
(TS) and sulfated zirconia (SZ) (Table 8, Entries 37–41). Under op-
timized reaction conditions, HMF is rapidly converted into BHMF
with Au/Al2O3 catalyst with a yield of >96% (Table 8, Entry 42). The
catalyst prepared under H2 at 200 °C had the smallest gold par-
ticles with sub-nanometer diameter of 0.88 ± 0.30 nm, indicating
the formation of a magic number Au13 cluster. In neutral aqueous
medium, Pt/MCM-41 catalyst is able to hydrogenate HMF into BHMF
with complete conversion and selectivity of 99% (Table 8, Entry 43)
[664]. Particularly, the amount of water plays a significant role in
the conversion and selectivity of the reaction. It is speculated that
hydrogen bonding occurs between water molecules and the hy-
droxyl groups on the support surface, which can help the water
molecules surrounding the catalyst surface to disperse the cata-
lyst. Thus, better catalytic activity (100% HMF conversion and ~100%
BHMF selectivity) can be achieved in an aqueous medium by using
a specific amount of water (Table 8, Entry 44). However, too much
water results in decreased conversion (71%) and selectivity (<90%),
which is possibly due to the reduced collisions between the reac-
tant and catalyst caused by substrate dilution.

4.2.2.4. 2,5-Dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF). DMTHF, which has
low miscibility with water, a moderate boiling point (90 °C) and high
energy density (31 MJ·L−1), is a promising transportation fuel can-
didate. In a single step procedure, a coupled catalyst RhCl3/HI is able
to promote the formation of DMTHF from poly- and monosaccha-
rides including corn stover, cellulose, inulin, sucrose, glucose and
fructose, and a maximum DMTHF yield of 86% can be obtained
(Table 8, Entries 45–49) [665]. It was found that HI functions as both
a dehydrating agent in the initial sugar-to-HMF conversion and a
reducing agent for the subsequent transformation of HMF to
5-methylfurfural (MFf) [676]. The regeneration of HI from I2 formed
in the reduction step is realized by rhodium-catalyzed hydrogena-
tion, and moreover, the metal catalyst also acts on the hydrogenation
of C:O and C:C bonds (Fig. 38). Before full hydrogenation of HMF
to DMF, the key intermediate 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol (MFFA) is
formed with a high selectivity of 60% in a short time (2–30 min)
over Cu-based catalysts (Table 8, Entries 50 and 51), and it is rapidly
converted to DMF after prolonged reaction time [666].

From above discussion, it is clear that the reactivity of HMF in
the presence of metal-containing catalysts is diverse. Mitra et al.
[667] stated especially for HMF that the product distribution/
selectivity is affected by the additives. As shown in Fig. 39, Pd/C
catalyst is capable of selectively mediating three broad reactions
of HMF covering decarbonylation, hydrogenation, and hydrogenolysis.
Without adding any additives but at high reaction temperature
(≥120 °C) in suitable solvents like dioxane, HMF can be decar-
bonylated to FfA in high yields reaching 90% in air (Table 8, Entry
52). The decarbonylation of HMF is suppressed in the presence of
formic acid, while DMF is formed as the exclusive product (85% yield)
in dioxane (Table 8, Entry 53). Similar to formic acid (FA), acetic acid
(AA) also displays favorable effects on the production of DMF (42%
yield) from HMF (Table 8, Entry 54). In the absence of formic acid,
DMF undergoes further hydrogenation to DMTHF, indicating that
the acid inhibits the hydrogenation of the furan-ring (Table 8, Entry
55).

In another case, the combined use of Pd/C and Amberlyst-15
allows the one-pot transformation of fructose and inulin into
5-hydroxy-2,5-hexanedione (HHD) with a maximum yield of 77%
and 100% carbon balance in a solution of THF and 0.3 wt% DMSO
at 80 °C and 1.0–3.5 MPa H2 partial pressure after 15–36 h (Table 8,
Entry 56) [668], implying that a synergistic effect exists for the acid
and hydrogenating sites in the reaction system [677]. An increase
of the amount of Amberlyst-15 from 11 to 35 wt% along with the
addition of 0.3 wt% of DMSO into THF leads to the complete

conversion of fructose and inulin to the dominant product HMF and
minor HHD, while further increasing the pressure of hydrogen from
1.0 to 2.0 MPa allows an increase in the yield of HHD by consum-
ing HMF in a concomitant route (Table 8, Entry 57). The combined
use of Pd/C and Amberlyst-15 in a single reactor for the efficient
and direct transformation of fructose and inulin into HHD illus-
trates the cooperativity of these two catalytic systems. Zhou et al.
[669] demonstrated that 1 wt% Pt/C and a solid acid Amberlite®IR-
120H have a cooperative effect on conversion of HHD to DMTHF with
yields up to 99% being obtained (Table 8, Entry 58) through a key
intermediate 2,5-dihydroxyhexane (DHH; Table 8, Entries 59 and
60) [670] as illustrated in Fig. 38. The dual catalyst system exhib-
its constant activity and DMTHF selectivity for five recovery and reuse
cycles. Single bifunctionalized solid materials are likely to improve
catalytic efficiency [678,679], wherein metal particles and Lewis acid
sites can synergistically catalyze the course of hydrogenations.

4.2.3. Hydrodeoxygenation of biomass derivatives with furfural as
an intermediate

Furfural, which is the major dehydration product of pentoses,
is capable of providing hydrogenated products through reduction
(Fig. 40) [680,681]. As shown in Route a, hydrogenation of the C:O
group in HMF gives FfA, and the furan ring can be further hydro-
genated to yield tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). Rather than
reducing the unsaturated bond, the hydrogenolysis of C—O bond
of FfA to MF and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) can take place

(Fig. 40, Route b). Moreover, furfuryl ether formed via a condensa-
tion process (Fig. 40, Route c), as well as THF from the cascade
decarbonylation at high temperature [682] and succedent hydro-
genation of furfural with furan as the intermediate (Fig. 40, Route
d) can also be realized.

4.2.3.1. Furfuryl alcohol (FfA). FfA is a promising feedstock for the
production of resins, rubbers, polymers and valuable chemicals like
THFA and EL, and can also be used as a non-reactive diluent and
solvent [683–689]. Industrial methods to produce FfA from furfu-
ral are typically mediated by Cu—Cr based catalysts under H2 pressure
via gas phase and liquid phase reactions [690,691]. However, these
catalytic processes have high toxicity and only moderate efficien-
cy, therefore, the pre-requisite but challenging task is to design active
catalytic systems that avoid the negative effects of this reaction
system. Avoiding Cr additives, copper-containing catalysts such as
Cu—Fe, Pd—Cu/SiO2, Cu—MgO, CuNi—MgAlO and Cu/C could also
give rise to high activity in terms of furfural conversion (up to
98%) and FfA selectivity (up to 98%; Table 9, Entries 1–3)
[692–694,718–720]. Likewise, Co- and Ni-based amorphous cata-
lysts are highly selective for furfural-to-FfA conversion (around 99%;
Table 9, Entries 4–7) [695–698,721]. Unfortunately, the stability of
these heterogeneous catalysts is rarely reported [722,723]. The re-
usability of Pt/C catalyst has been explored in the liquid-phase
hydrogenation of furfural to FfA and no adverse effect is detected
for azeotropic mixtures of water and 2-propanol (Table 9, Entry 8)
[699]. Nevertheless, when the support is changed from carbon to
oxides, undesirable reactions such as hydrogenolysis of the C—O
bond, decarbonylation, furan ring hydrogenation and opening occurs
that causes a decrease in the selectivity of FfA from 99% to 94% with
Pt/TiO2—SiO2 or to 34% with Pt/SiO2 (Table 9, Entries 9 and10) [700].
After modification by SnBu4, the selectivity of Pt-based monome-
tallic catalyst reaches 98%, and an almost constant FfA selectivity
of 96% is observed over the bimetallic catalyst PtSn0.3 during the three
cycles of reaction (Table 9, Entry 11) [701]. The nature of the cat-
alyst support directly affects the stability and selectivity of metal
particles, and the use of carbon as the solid support seems to be
the good candidate for selective production of FfA. Bimetallic cata-
lysts are likely to enhance both stability and selectivity for the partial

hydrogenation reaction, which deserves to be further studied for
producing biomass-derived products with high selectivity.

Some other supported catalysts have been developed for the syn-
thesis of FfA from furfural. In comparison to NiB and NiMoB catalyst,
amorphous NiMoB/Al2O3 alloy catalysts prepared from reduction of
γ-Al2O3 supported NiCl2·6H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O by NaBH4 could
convert 99% furfural into FfA with a high yield of 91% in methanol
(Table 9, Entries 12–14) [702]. The CuCa/SiO2 catalyst prepared by
sol–gel technique is found to have a relatively higher dispersion of
copper than that fabricated by impregnation [703]. Correspond-
ingly, the former catalyst (CuCa/SiO2-SG) affords a higher and more
constant activity (99% selectivity and 100% conversion) than CuCa/
SiO2-IM in the synthesis of FfA from furfural (Table 9, Entries 15 and
16), which might be attributed to the presence of calcium acting
as a structural promoter that improves catalyst stability as well as
selectivity.

The distribution of products is a strong function of the em-
ployed metal catalyst (Fig. 41) [704]. Over Cu/SiO2 catalyst, FfA in
high selectivity with only a small amount of MF is obtained, while
furan from furfural decarbonylation occurs with Pd/SiO2, and THF
would be generated by further hydrogenation (Table 9, Entries 17
and 18). Ring opening products (ROP) such as butanal, butanol and
butane would be formed in significant amounts if Ni/SiO2 catalyst
is used (Table 9, Entry 19) [704]. In agreement with these results,
a DFT study illustrated that thermodynamics favors the produc-
tion of furan and CO, while the formation of MF requiring lower
activation energy occurs through the dehydration of FfA or a de-
hydrogenation pathway involving a methoxy intermediate [724].
Apart from metal types, the nature of supports affects catalytic per-
formance. In this regards, Mironenko et al. [705] demonstrated that
1.5 wt% Pd/CB (carbon black) affords a high FfA selectivity of 99%
from furfural (Table 9, Entries 20 and 21). In contrast, 1.5 wt% Pd/
CNT (carbon nanotubes) are not active for FfA production under mild
conditions, while the reduction of both C:O group and furan ring
to THFA occur at 90 °C (Table 9, Entries 22 and 23). Selectivity toward
FfA directly from xylose in a one-step process over a dual catalyst
system composed of Pt/SiO2 and sulfated ZrO2 strongly depends on
the solvent that can inhibit the product polymerization [706]. With
the help of H2O/2-propanol in a ratio of 1:3 (v/v), a selectivity as

high as 51% toward FfA can be achieved directly from xylose (65%
conversion) in a single pot (Table 9, Entry 24). For the hydrogena-
tion step, alcoholic solvents show outstanding effects on kinetics
due to their good hydrogen solubility. With respect to carbohy-
drate dehydration, the use of biphasic media is superior for producing
furfural, which is realized by transferring the formed furanic com-
pound into the organic phase, thus avoiding its degradation and
condensation in the acidic aqueous solution.

4.2.3.2. Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). THFA, which is exten-
sively used in industry as a chemical intermediate, is manufactured
from the hydrogenation of FfA and furfural in the presence of nickel
palladium, rhodium and platinum catalysts [725–727]. The gas-
phase direct hydrogenation of furfural to THFA is preferable to liquid-
phase reactions in terms of productivity and the prevention of
leaching [728]. Over Ni/SiO2 catalysts with <4 nm nickel particle sizes
were prepared from the reduction of supported nickel nitrate, the
gas-phase total hydrogenation of furfural proceeds giving THFA at
yields of 94% (Table 9, Entry 25) [707]. Moreover, both bulk and sup-
ported Sn—Ni-based alloy catalysts are active for converting furfural
to THFA (up to 99% selectivity), and relatively high temperatures
(ca. 130 versus 110 °C) are necessary for efficient hydrogenation of
C:O rather than C:C (Table 9, Entries 26 and 27) [708]. With the as-
sistance of a biphasic system, Ordomsky et al. [709] combined the
processes of xylose dehydration with Amberlyst-15 and consecu-
tive furfural hydrogenation over a hydrophobic Ru/C catalyst into
a single reactor. For increasing the hydrophobicity of solvents in the
order: 1-butanol < MTHF < cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of xylose
to xylitol is suppressed, thus facilitating the formation of THFA (up
to 50% selectivity) directly from xylose via the intermediate furfu-
ral (Table 9, Entries 28–31).

4.2.3.3. 2-Methylfuran (MF). Analogous to DMF, 2-methylfuran is a
model biomass-derived liquid fuel that can be used for the

synthesis of crysanthemate pesticides, perfume and medical inter-
mediates [729–731]. Using furfural or FfA as the substrate, both
commercial Cu—Zn and self-made Cu—Cr bimetallic catalysts exhibit
nearly complete conversion for MF production (up to 96% yield) at
200–300 °C with the activity of Zn-promoted catalyst being supe-
rior to Cr-mediated ones (Table 9, Entries 32–35) [710]. The high
yield of MF over Zn-promoted catalyst results from a synergistic effect
of the metal and the weak acid sites [732]. The influence of mono-
and bimetallic catalysts (i.e., Ni/SiO2 and NiFe/SiO2) on the product
distribution in the conversion of furfural has been examined (Table 9,
Entries 36–38) [711], where it is found that monometallic catalyst
facilitated the formation of FfA and furan through separate hydro-
genation and decarbonylation, while the yield of MF greatly increases
through suppressing the formation of furan probably caused by Fe
species in bimetallic catalyst (Fig. 42). In this catalytic process, the
C:O hydrogenation occurs at low temperatures (ca. 140 °C) via either
an alkoxide or ahydroxyalkyl intermediate [733], while the C—O
hydrogenolysis requires relatively high temperatures.

Under ambient pressure at 150 °C, molybdenum carbide (Mo2C)
catalysts are robust for the cleavage of the C:O bond of furfural in
vapor phase HDO without concurrent scission of the side C—C bond,
yielding MF with a selectivity of ~50–60% for less than 1% furan se-
lectivity (Table 9, Entry 39) [712]. The metal-like sites on Mo2C
catalysts prove to be involved in the HDO of furfural via the invari-
ance of MF site time yield normalized by the catalytic sites. A
sequential reaction process of xylose-to-MF carried out with a con-
tinuous two-liquid-phase (aqueous-toluene) plug-flow reactor, in
which xylose was dehydrated to furfural (98% yield) in water over
H-mordenite at 260 °C and 5.5 MPa N2 and furfural extracted from
the aqueous phase into the toluene was further hydrogenated to
give MF (98% yield) at 252 °C and 0.1 MPa H2 (gas flow: 48 h−1) over
a Cu—Fe catalyst (Table 9, Entry 40) [713]. Besides H2, alcohol hy-
drogen donor was found to be efficient for MF production (up to
76% yield) from the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural over

a calcined Ru/C catalyst in liquid phase at 110–200 °C [714]. The
yield of MF is influenced by the alcohol dehydrogenation activity
as well as solvent polarity, and increased following the order:
2-methyl-2-butanol < tert-butanol < ethanol < 1-propanol ≈ 1-
butanol < 2-propanol < 2-butanol ≈ 2-pentanol (Table 9, Entries
41–49).

4.2.3.4. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF). The chemical, MTHF, which
can be used as a pharmaceutical solvent and an oxygenated gaso-
line additive in P-series fuel [734–738] can be synthesized from
selective hydrogenation of MF over cubic platinum nanoparticles
of 7 nm average size (Fig. 43), where the distribution of products
varies with reaction temperature (40–120 °C) [715]. At 40 °C, the
main product is 1-pentanol (~98% selectivity) formed via a ring-
opening process; while the dominant ring-opening product changes
to 2-pentanol with an increase of temperature to 95 °C (Table 9,
Entries 50 and 51). Unfortunately, the relative concentration of the
hydrogenated ring product MTHF remains low, regardless of how
temperature is varied. To solve the mass transfer limitations caused
by low solubility of hydrogen gas in the solvent, Liu et al. [739] in-
troduced a packed-bed microreactor with Pd/C catalyst offering a
safe and alternative approach to high-pressure hydrogenation of MF
into MTHF. In another case, the decarbonylation of furfural to furan
over the same Pd/C catalyst was demonstrated to be a prerequi-
site for THF formation (Table 9, Entries 52 and 53) [716]. In the
presence of a metal–acid bifunctional catalyst 2 wt% PtMo/Hβ,
Mizugaki et al. [717] demonstrated that levulinic acid (LA) could
be successively hydrogenated to 1,4-pentanediol and dehydrated to
form MTHF in a yield of 86% (Table 9, Entry 54). A synergistic effect
between Pt nanoparticles and MoOx species promotes the hydro-
genation of LA to 1,4-pentanediol, while Hβ possesses a dual function

as an effective support for high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and
MoOx, as well as acid catalyst promoting the cyclodehydration of
1,4-pentanediol to MTHF.

4.2.4. (Hydrolysis)–hydrogenation–cyclization of biomass
derivatives to γ-valerolactone (GVL)

The chemical, GVL, is useful as a solvent [740–742], intermedi-
ate [743–745], perfume and food additive [746], and in particular,
is a potential fuel additive [747,748]. One possible pathway to syn-
thesize GVL from biomass-derived LA involves an unstable
intermediate γ-hydroxyvaleric acid produced via hydrogenation, fol-
lowed by elimination of a water molecule in the intramolecular
esterification to give GVL through ring closure (Fig. 44) [749,750].
In another pathway, angelica lactone (α and β isomer) formed from
LA dehydration is hydrogenated to produce GVL [751,752]. To achieve
high performance in the synthesis of GVL from different feed-
stocks, much attention has been paid to develop environmentally
benign and cost efficient processes with heterogeneous catalysis.
Compared with in-situ hydrogen sources, the catalytic transfer hy-
drogenation (CTH) of levulinates via Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley
(MPV) reduction with alcohols is thought to be a favorable method
for GVL production. Handling liquid alcohols used in the CTH route
is not only more convenient than molecular H2 but also allows high
selectivity of the hydrogenation of alkyl levulinates to GVL without
over-hydrogenating GVL to byproducts. Furthermore, the CTH route
to GVL can be carried out over inexpensive base metal catalysts with
Zr, Ni and Sn as the active sites, which is attractive for the produc-
tion of GVL on a commercial scale.

4.2.4.1. Direct catalytic hydrogenation. In general, LA and esters can
be produced from C6 sugars via an anaerobic oxidation process

[753–757]. If furfural synthesized from C5 carbohydrates is in-situ
hydrogenated into FfA, then high yields of LA are obtained in a single
pot as well via subsequent rehydration [758,759]. Zeolites, which
are acid catalysts active for hydrolysis [760], are efficient for the syn-
thesis of LA from xylose under hot-compressed water [761]. In a
one-pot process, a maximum LA yield of 30% is achieved over 0.25 M
NaOH-treated HY zeolite at 170 °C and 1.5 MPa N2 partial pressure
in 3 h, and the in-situ generated formic acid is thought to be the
hydrogen source in the key step of furfural-to-FfA hydrogenation.
Starting from biomass derived LA, a number of studies focus on using
metal particles and oxides as catalysts to produce GVL under mo-
lecular hydrogen, formic acid, and alcohols. When different solvents
like water and alcohols are employed, reaction pathways from
LA to GVL are dissimilar (Fig. 45) [762]. In water medium, the
first step is direct hydrogenation of the keto group in LA to give
4-hydroxyvaleric acid, followed by dehydration to yield cyclic GVL,
while GVL in the presence of methanol is formed through sequen-
tial esterification of the carboxyl group to methyl levulinate (ML),
hydrogenation to methyl 4-hydroxypentanoate, and intramolecu-
lar transesterification to eliminate methanol.

Ruthenium-based catalysts often exhibit high activity in the
process of LA-to-GVL conversion, and due attention has been paid
to seek mild reaction conditions [763]. In a continuous down-flow
fixed-bed reactor system, 5% Ru/C in comparison to Pt/C and Pd/C
is found to be more active (100% conversion) and product selec-
tive toward GVL (up to 100% selectivity) in dioxane from the vapor
phase hydrogenation of LA (Table 10, Entries 1–3) [764], and com-
parable GVL selectivity (99%) and LA conversion (92%) are obtained
in methanol over the same catalyst Ru/C at a lower temperature of
130 °C (Table 10, Entry 4) [765]. When an acidic support (e.g.,
hydroxyapatite and DOWEX 50WX2-100) is used, reaction tem-
peratures tend to decrease for the one-pot conversion of LA to GVL

(Table 10, Entries 5–8) [766,767]. The complete LA conversion is ob-
tained at 130 °C in an alcohol solvent (e.g., ethanol) over ruthenium
supported with different solid acid supports such as TiO2, SiO2 and
Al2O3 (Table 10, Entries 9–12) [768]. Cross-linked sulfonated
polyethersulfone supported Ru nanoparticle catalysts highly hy-
drogenate LA (88% conversion) into GVL (100% selectivity) at 70 °C
(Table 10, Entries 13–17) [769]. The combined use of a ruthenium
catalyst (Ru/C) with an acid such as Amberlyst-70 or Amberlyst-
15, niobium phosphate, and oxides increases the reaction rate in
both esterification and hydrogenation steps, and a high GVL yields
of 99% with an activity of 558 h−1 are realized from LA over a co-
catalyst consisting of Ru/C and Amberlyst-70 (Table 10, Entries 18
and 19) [770]. Many other types of metal particles have been studied
for this catalytic process, namely iridium nanoparticles and com-
plexes (Table 10, Entries 20–22) [771–773], palladium based mono
and bimetallic catalysts (Table 10, Entries 23–25) [774–776], Raney
and supported Ni catalysts (Table 10, Entries 26–28) [777–779], and
noble-metal-free catalysts such as copper (Table 10, Entries 29–
31) [780–782], ferrous (Table 10, Entry 32) [783] and cobalt (Table 10,
Entry 33) [784] nanoparticles, which are efficient to synthesize GVL
from LA under a H2 atmosphere. Nevertheless, relative high hydro-
gen pressures and reaction temperatures are always required.

Instead of using LA as the starting material, the direct synthe-
sis of GVL from C5- and C6-sugar sources is possible without isolating
the intermediate LA from the reaction mixture, which may reduce
the number of processing steps (Fig. 46). Using molecular hydro-
gen as hydrogen donor, an acid catalyst (e.g., trifluoroacetic acid)
in combination with a hydrogenation catalyst Ru/C could produce
GVL in yields of 29–62% from glucose, fructose, sucrose and cellu-
lose via a two-step process conducted (Table 10, Entries 34–37) [785].
It is clear that a strong acid is required to produce LA from C6-
sugars in the first step, and then integration with the hydrogenation

Fig. 46. Production of γ-valerolactone (GVL) from C5- and C6-sugars involving levulinic acid (LA), furfuryl alcohol (FfA), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and furfural as
intermediates.

step over a metal catalyst yields GVL (Table 10, Entries 38 and 39)
[786,787,804,805]. Employing GVL as a co-solvent, transformation
of C6-sugars, in particular, cellulose in a biphasic reaction system
consisting of GVL and aqueous solution could eliminate the need
to purify GVL from the extraction solvent [806–808]. By adopting
a bifunctional catalytic system based on Ru/C and niobium oxide
or niobium phosphate, straight production of GVL from water slur-
ries of giant reed was realized, producing a moderate GVL yield of
17% with an almost complete conversion of intermediate LA
(Table 10, Entry 40) [788]. The acid component favors initial acti-
vation of the carbonyl group toward hydrogenation and subsequent
esterification reaction to produce GVL. In the case of C5-sugar de-
rivatives, a combination of an acidic IL [BMIm—SH][HSO4] and 5%
Ru/C catalyst is efficient for the sequential alcoholysis and hydro-
genation of FfA to GVL via the corresponding levulinic esters in
methanol, ethanol, n-butanol and isopropyl alcohol solvents
(Table 10, Entry 41) [789], while an extra hydrogenation step to
produce FfA is necessary when furfural used as substrate [809]. Since
LA is the shared intermediate for the production of GVL from both
C5- and C6-sugars, the integrated conversion of hemicellulose and
cellulose to GVL has also been proposed [810]. This process allows
for the simultaneous conversion of hemicellulose and cellulose to
small molecules in a single reactor, thus eliminating pre-treatment
steps that would be required to fractionate biomass. The inte-
grated process has great potential for directly converting sugar
components into a common product LA with improved selectivity
so that it also offers the possibility of producing downstream chemi-
cals like GVL.

4.2.4.2. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH). As an attractive al-
ternative to the hydrogenation of LA to GVL using molecular H2 over
metal catalyst, CTH with the hydrogen source being a secondary
alcohol through the MPV reaction has been proposed as in Fig. 47

[790]. Among the catalytic systems, zirconia-based catalysts are fre-
quently studied. Chia et al. [790] found that metal oxides such as
ZrO2, MgO/ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, and CeZrOx could efficiently catalyze the
transfer hydrogenation of LA and esters with 2-butanol as solvent
and hydrogen donor, giving GVL in a maximum yield of 92% (Table 10,
Entries 42–45). Basic sites in a cooperative manner with acid sites
of ZrO2-based catalysts are proposed to be active for the MPV re-
action, leading to concerted direct CTH through a six-membered
cyclic transition state. Similarly, ZrO(OH)2·xH2O is active for the con-
version of EL (94% conversion) to GVL with a selectivity of 95% when
2-propanol is used as hydrogen donor (Table 10, Entry 46) [791].
The selectivities to GVL and by-products are not affected notice-
ably by reaction temperature, duration and catalyst loading. Although
hydrogen transfer from ethanol to EL is likely to be suppressed when
temperatures exceed 240 °C, a high GVL yield of 82% with 96% EL
conversion is obtained in supercritical ethanol at 250 °C after 3 h
over an amorphous ZrO2 catalyst calcined at 300 °C with a high spe-
cific surface area and a large number of acid–base sites (Table 10,
Entry 47) [792]. After recycling of ZrO2 for 4 times, EL conversion
and the GVL yield gradually decline to 55 and 43%, respectively. The
deposition of humins, probably generated by an aldol condensa-
tion among EL, GVL and aldehyde, onto the surface of ZrO2 are
speculated to cause the partial deactivation of ZrO2. A porous Zr-
containing catalyst as well as zirconium–Beta zeolite also prove to
be robust for the transformation of EL and LA to GVL via MPV re-
duction (Table 10, Entries 48 and 49) [793,794], and the isolated
Lewis acid and base sites contribute to the high catalytic activity
[811]. The stability of zirconium enhanced by organic or inorganic
framework renders the catalysts to be reusable without notice-
able decreases in the conversion, yield and selectivity after several
consecutive cycles. Furthermore, some other metals like Raney Ni
(Table 10, Entry 50) [795,796] and Pd/C (Table 10, Entry 51) [797]
are stable and effective for the hydrogenation of LA and EL to GVL

in a secondary alcohol solvent such as 2-sec-butyl-phenol and iso-
propanol. The hydride shift is confirmed to be the rate-limiting step,
and increasing polarity of the hydrogen donor leads to a decrease
in the reaction rates. Importantly, a first-order dependence on alkyl
levulinate and secondary alcohol supports a dual-binding mecha-
nism, where the ketone and alcohol interact with a single metal site
to form a six-membered transition state [811]. A synergic effect
between base and acid sites has been demonstrated to be respon-
sible for the enhanced activity in levulinates-to-GVL conversion
[812–814], wherein basic sites (e.g., O2−) assisted with Lewis acidic
sites (e.g., Zr4+) can activate the dissociation of the hydroxyl groups
in alcohols for MPV reaction to produce an unstable intermediate
4-hydroxypentanoate, followed by intramolecular esterification or
transesterification to yield GVL promoted by acid or base sites.

Using formic acid as the hydrogen source, Deng et al. [798] state
that the transformation of LA to GVL is achieved over a heteroge-
neous ruthenium based catalyst including Ru—P/SiO2, Ru—N/SiO2
and Ru—S/SiO2 in basic water with equimolar formic acid (Fig. 48;
Table 10, Entries 52–55). The immobilized Ru2+ is speculated to act
as a bifunctional catalyst to decompose formic acid and hydroge-
nate LA in a single step, producing a high GVL yield of 96%. The only
side products, water and carbon dioxide, are easily removed and
separated from the product GVL under reduced pressure (Table 10,
Entries 56 and 57) [799,800]. Similarly, Du et al. [801] developed
a hydrogen-independent reductive process for the conversion of LA
and esters to GVL over supported gold catalysts, especially
Au/ZrO2(Table 10, Entries 58 and 59) [802]. Hydrophobic alcohols
like butanol are able to be used for the intermediate production of
levulinate and formate esters and can be recovered by extraction
protocol after elimination from the esters caused by the subse-
quent formation of GVL. Afterwards, the same group describe an
earth-abundant, inexpensive, and robust copper-based metal oxide
catalyst Cu/ZrO2 for the direct conversion of an aqueous mixture
of LA and formic acid (1:1, n/n), giving GVL in high yields (up to 100%)
(Table 10, Entry 60) [803]. The use of formic acid produced during
acid hydrolysis of biomass provides in-situ generation of H2 gas in
the system for the subsequent hydrogenation process. As com-
pared to platinum or palladium catalyst in the hydrogenation of
ketones, ruthenium generally exhibits relatively lower activity in
gas phase, but is efficient under aqueous/liquid phase conditions
[815–817]. The presence of an H-bonded water molecule has been
verified to dramatically reduce the energetic span of the reaction
pathway and to enhance catalytic activity [818]. Among various hy-
drogen sources used for GVL production, molecular hydrogen, formic
acid and secondary alcohols are always demonstrated to exhibit high
catalytic performance. However, high pressure is involved in the
storage/usage of hydrogen, which is expensive and unsafe. For using
formic acid as the H-donor, only limited number of catalysts bearing
acid-resistant property can selectively decompose formic acid into

H2 rather than CO and H2O. The use of inexpensive and abundant
alcohols as hydrogen donor and solvent over cheap acid–base bi-
functional solid catalysts appears to be promising for GVL production
through MPV reduction. In this regard, the development of
functionalized catalysts active for CTH process is of high demand.

4.2.4.3. Upgrading of GVL. GVL is a platform molecule that has many
potential applications in the production of chemicals and fuels
(Fig. 49) [819]. Through hydrogenation, 1,4-pentanediol can be
formed, which may readily undergo dehydration to give MTHF. Sub-
sequently, the in-situ generated pentanoic acid can be converted
to 5-nonanone with ketonization, followed by subsequent deoxy-
genation and oligomerization to produce nonane and C18−C27
alkanes, respectively. The decarboxylation of ring-opening product
pentenoic acid leads to the formation of butene, which is able to
be dimerized to C8 alkanes. By means of transesterification, alkyl
pentenoate is yielded from GVL, which can be transformed into
caprolactone, caprolactam, and adipic acid by hydroformylation,
hydrocyanation, and hydroxycarbonylation, respectively. More-
over, a precursor of acrylic polymers, α-methylene-γ-valerolactone,
can be created from GVL by reacting with formaldehyde [820]. All
of these reaction pathways demonstrate that GVL is a versatile plat-
form for the production of chemicals and biofuels.

Besides the complete catalytic hydrogenation of MF and furfu-
ral to produce MTHF [821,822], GVL has recently emerged as a
promising sustainable substrate as well [823]. A simple, yet versa-
tile heterogeneous catalyst system comprised of highly dispersed
copper in a zirconia matrix (Cu/ZrO2—OG) prepared by an oxalate-
gel-coprecipitation method is efficient to selectively catalyze the
hydrogenolysis of GVL in ethanol [824]. Both products 1,4-
pentanediol and MTHF can be selectively produced by controlling
the calcination temperature for Cu/ZrO2—OG catalyst. A high MTHF
yield of 91% with a remarkable conversion of GVL (up to 98%) is re-
alized at 240 °C and 6 MPa H2 partial pressure within 6 h, when the
calcination temperature is set at 300 or 400 °C. Under identical re-
action conditions but increasing the calcination temperature to above
600 °C, 1,4-pentanediol is observed to be the major product (76%
selectivity) with a very poor selectivity to MTHF (11%) for GVL con-
version of 96%. The H2 pressure and copper loading are also found
to affect the distribution of the products [825]. At a fixed temper-
ature of 265 °C with 5 wt% Cu/SiO2 catalyst in the hydrogenation
of LA with a complete conversion, the selectivity toward GVL in-
creases from 94 to ~100% with an increase in H2 partial pressure
from 0.1 to 1.0 MPa, while a further increase in pressure gives rise
to the formation of 1,4-pentanediol at the expense of GVL. An in-
crease in copper loading leads to further hydrogenation of GVL to
MTHF with a high yield of 64% at copper loading up to 80 wt%.
Notably, the addition and the formation of water in the catalytic
process of LA hydrogenation over Ru/C catalyst inhibit the

dehydration step and shift the dominant reaction toward the gen-
eration of 2-pentanol (Fig. 50). In line with this, the desired product
MTHF in a yield of 61% is obtained from LA via a two-step reac-
tion involving an intermediate removal of water [826].

In an aqueous solution at temperatures above 350 °C and water
partial pressure of 100 kPa, GVL reactant over a solid acid catalyst
undergoes ring-opening to produce 3- and 4-pentenoic acids, and
succedent isomerization to form 2-pentenoic acid, followed by ir-
reversible decarboxylation to yield 1-butene and carbon dioxide in
an equimolar amount [827]. However, the isomerization of 1-butene
to trans- and cis-2-butene essentially proceeds to equilibrium, and
only 23% of 1-butene in C4 stream is retained [828]. Unexpect-
edly, almost pure 1-butene of C4 stream (>99%) is achieved with a
Lewis acid catalyst like γ-Al2O3 for the decarboxylation of GVL in
water at 275 °C [829]. On the contrary, the decarboxylation of GVL
under anhydrous conditions is correlated strongly with the Bronsted
rather than Lewis acidity of the catalyst [830]. With an integrated
biorefining strategy [831], GVL can be produced simultaneously from
the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions using GVL as solvent, which
is converted to butene and then into butene oligomers in the pres-
ence of a number of acids and metal catalysts (Fig. 51) [832].

In the presence of acid sites, the ring-opening reaction of GVL
to pentenoic acid takes place easily, whereas further hydrogena-
tion rather than decarboxylation of the unsaturated carboxylic acid

produces pentanoic or valeric acid and its esters [833–835]. The
counterpart alkyl (mono/di) valerate esters are regarded as plat-
form chemicals for cellulosic transportation fuels [836], which can
be manufactured from lignocellulosic materials through the se-
quential hydrolysis to LA, hydrogenation of the organic acid to GVL,
ring-opening and hydrogenation to valeric acid, and esterification
with alcohols (Fig. 52) [837]. In line with this, a cooperative mech-
anism of Pt and Bronsted acid sites of HMFI zeolite has been
proposed for the case of LA conversion to valeric biofuels, in which
the formation of alkyl valerate is driven by Pt-catalyzed hydroge-
nation of LA to GVL, which undergoes proton-assisted ring-opening
by the acidic zeolite, followed by Pt-catalyzed hydrogenation and
acid-mediated esterification [838]. In particular, one-pot conver-
sion directly from LA is realized over 1 wt% Ru/H—ZSM5 catalyst,
and a moderate yield of valeric acid and its esters (46%) is ob-
tained at 200 °C and 4 MPa H2 partial pressure [839]. The GVL ring-
opening step appears to be the rate-determining step on the pathway
to valeric acid, and the increase in acid sites on the support im-
proves the selectivity to ethyl valerate and valeric acid [840]. As an
interesting alternative to noble metals, a bifunctional catalyst con-
sisting of copper supported on an amorphous material with weak
acidity (e.g., ZrO2—SiO2) converts 90% GVL directly into pentyl val-
erate with a selectivity up to 83% at 250 °C and 1 MPa H2 partial
pressure after 20 h [841]. Without using an acidic support such as

Cu/ZrO2—SiO2, the Cu/SiO2 catalyst exhibits comparable activity (91%
conversion) and improved selectivity of 92% in the one-pot trans-
formation of GVL into pentyl valerate [842]. It is speculated that the
small copper particles display catalytically relevant Lewis acidity
which is increased with reduction of CuO phase to the metallic state
[842]. The subsequent conversion of valeric acid via ketonization
leads to the formation of 5-nonanone over niobia and/or a ceria–
zirconia catalyst, and a diesel fuel n-nonane is produced from this
C9 ketone through successive hydrogenation and dehydration to a
mixture of linear C9 alkenes, followed by a second time hydroge-
nation [843]. By another way, the oligomerization of C9 alkenes can
occur at 160 °C over an acid catalyst such as Amberlyst-70 to produce

C18 alkenes, which is a precursor for jet fuel upon hydrogenation
[844]. Using different substrates (e.g., LA and cellulose) as starting
materials, the appropriate combination of acids with metals through
integrated biorefinery processes also produces corresponding hy-
drocarbon fuels via the key intermediate C9 ketone [845,846]. The
production of bio-based polymers can be achieved from further
upgrading of GVL to di-functional monomers, followed by copoly-
merization [847–852]. GVL, which has been identified as an
important precursor, is being extensively used for the production
of chemicals and fuels on the lab scale and it is likely to find at-
tractive applications in industrial manufacture in the near
future.

4.2.5. Hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation of biomass derivatives to
other hydrogenated products

Bifunctional materials have been used to prepare a number of
other products via hydrogenation-involved processes. For example,
acid–metal binary catalysts mediated selective hydrogenation of MA
to succinic anhydride or propionic acid [853–855], reduction of LA
to diols, alkenes or alkanes [856–858], reductive amination of LA
to pyrrolidones [859], hydrogenolysis of diethyl succinate to THF
[860], and selective H2 synthesis from carbohydrates [861,862] have
great potential for producing hydrogenated products derived from
biomass.

4.2.5.1. Cyclopentanone and 3-hydroxymethylcyclopentanone. Cyclo-
pentanone, which is a versatile intermediate for the synthesis of
rubbers, fungicides, pharmaceuticals, flavors, fragrances, and C15—C17
diesel or jet fuels [863–865], is generally prepared from petroleum-
based products via the vapor-phase cyclization of 1,6-hexanediol
[866] or the liquid phase oxidation of cyclopentene [867]. However,
selective rearrangement of FfA to cyclopentanone can be realized
with the promotion of hydrogen ions created by self-dissociation
of water (Fig. 53, Route A) [868]. Namely, cyclopentanone as the ex-
clusive product forms in a high yield of 95% over metal catalysts
with a low metal concentration of 0.25–1.0 wt% at 0.8–2.5 MPa H2
partial pressure. In contrast, relatively higher hydrogen partial pres-
sures and catalyst concentrations favor the formation of THFA. When
furfural is selected as the substrate, an additional hydrogenation step
is required for the production of hydrogenated intermediate FfA.
In an organic solvent like n-butanol, n-decanol and THF, the main
products of the reaction are the hydrogenated derivatives of fur-
fural such as FfA, THFA, MF, and MTHF, while furfural dissolved in

water is mainly converted into cyclopentanone at yields of up to
77% over 5wt% Pt/C catalyst at 160 °C and 8 MPa H2 partial pres-
sure along with a small amount of cyclopentanol (5% yield) [869]
generated from further hydrogenation of cyclopentanone [870]. The
attack of a H2O molecule on the 5-position of FfA contributes to the
opening and closure of the furan ring, and to the high selectivity
of cyclopentanone that is closely related to the presence of
2-cyclopentenone [871]. The stabilization of the carbocation of FfA
produced in an excess of hydrogen by the favorable scission of the
C—O bond in the alkoxide or hydroxyalkyl intermediates seems to
influence the selectivity of subsequent reactions [872]. Further-
more, the rate balance between the formation of FfA polymers on
the catalyst surface and their decomposition also results in the high
selectivity of FfA rearrangement to cyclopentanone [873]. Similar-
ly, the ring rearrangement of HMF to a cyclopentanone derivative,
3-hydroxymethylcyclopentanone, can be achieved through the hy-
drogenation with metal nanoparticles and the Lewis acid catalysis
of metal oxide supports (Fig. 53, Route B) [874], and a highest
3-hydroxymethylcyclopentanone yield of 86% is obtained over Au/
Nb2O5 catalyst at 140 °C and 8 MPa H2 partial pressure within 12 h.
By taking advantage of the selective hydrogenation on metal par-
ticles and the Lewis acid catalysis of solid supports, HMF can be
selectively converted into 3-hydroxymethylcyclopentanone. For fur-
fural, the balance between the rates of formation of furfuryl alcohol
polymers on the catalyst surface and their decomposition is likely
to be responsible for the high selectivity of furfural rearrange-
ment to cyclopentanone.

4.2.5.2. Diols. In the liquid-phase hydrogenation of FfA, THFA is gen-
erally the dominant product [875], while harsh reaction conditions

166

H. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 98–194

tend to drive the hydrogenolysis of the furan ring to synthesize diols
such as 1,2-pentanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, and 1,4-pentanediol. In the
case of 1,2-pentanediol, low pressure and high temperature favor
its generation, in which water is found to significantly enhance the
reaction rate [876]. Moreover, the cooperative catalysis of metal
nanoparticles and a basic support like HT drastically increases the
selectivity for 1,2-pentanediol [877]. However, a one-pot two-step
process with controlled temperatures is beneficial for the synthe-
sis of 1,5-pentanediol from furfural over bimetallic catalysts such
as Pd—Ir—ReOx/SiO2, Rh—Ir—ReOx/SiO2 and Pt/Co2AlO4, in which the
lower-temperature reaction step is very crucial for the total hydro-
genation of furfural into THFA intermediate and the hydrogenolysis
occurs during the high temperature step [878–880]. An integrated
conversion of furfural to 1,4-butanediol with a yield of 85% has been
realized over a multifunctional Pt/TiO2—ZrO2 catalyst with H2O2 in
HCOOH/H2O/MeOH at 120 °C and 3.5 MPa H2 partial pressure after
6 h. The conversion involves two sequential reaction steps consist-
ing of selectively oxidizing furfural to furanones and hydrogenation
of the mixture of furanones to 1,4-butanediol [881]. Likewise, the
production of 1,3-propanediol and 1,6-hexanediol has been real-
ized from the hydrogenolysis of glycerol and HMF over metal
particles with an acidic support, respectively [882,883]. In com-
parison with Bronsted and Lewis acidic supports like ZrP, HY zeolite,
Nb2O5, HZSM-5, SiO2—Al2O3, Al2O3 and SO4/ZrO2, the specific Bronsted
acidity on ZrP support can effectively accelerate the cleavage of C—O
bond in a furan ring, while the presence of a transition metal is re-
sponsible for FA dissociation, hence supplying in-situ the required
hydrogen for hydrogenation.

4.2.5.3. Upgrading of bio-oil. Bio-oil produced from biomass through
flash pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction can be upgraded to
engine fuels via HDO and zeolite cracking [884–886]. In the process
of syngas conversion to hydrocarbons, Fischer–Tropsch (FT) syn-
thesis is considered as a crucial step, while the biggest challenge
is the control of selectivity [887,888]. In this regard, the combina-
tion of acidic zeolites with an active FT catalyst considerably increases
the product selectivity toward liquid hydrocarbons [889]. As a model
reaction for bio-oil upgrading, a one-step hydrogenation–
esterification of furfural with acetic acid over a bifunctional catalyst
5 wt% Pd/Al2(SiO3)3 or Pd/Al—SBA-15 proceeds under mild condi-
tions to give FfA and ester in a selectivity of 66% [890,891]. Synergistic
effect of metal sites and acid sites for the one-step hydrogenation–
esterification over composite bifunctional catalyst of 5% Pd/
Al2(SiO3)3 is more efficient than the corresponding physically mixed
monofunctional catalysts. In a similar manner, Hf-, Zr- or Sn-Beta
zeolites effectively catalyze the coupled transfer hydrogenation and
etherification of HMF with primary and secondary alcohols into re-
newable fuel additives 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans without using
an external hydrogen source or precious metals [378,892]. Among
these zeolites, Hf- and Zr-Beta appear to be more active in the MPV
reduction whereas Sn-Beta exhibits the highest stability and se-
lectivity toward etherification.

4.2.5.4. Alkanes. Renewable routes have been developed to produce
liquid alkanes from biomass derivatives. The aqueous phase cata-
lytic hydrogenation/dehydration of furfural produces pentane over
bifunctional nickel-based catalysts [893]. On the nickel active sites
of these catalysts, some hydrogenated intermediates such as FfA,
THFA, 1,5-pentanediol, and tetrahydro-2-furancarboxaldehyde
derived from furfural, followed by migration to acid sites of the bi-
functional catalyst and undergo dehydration to form alkenes, and
in the subsequent hydrogenation step saturate the C:C bonds of
pentene to give pentane. The product distributions are greatly af-
fected by the type of metals with respect to the interaction strength
of the furan ring with the metal surface and the type of surface in-
termediates stabilized by each metal [894]. Specifically, high

selectivity to FfA is obtained over Cu/SiO2, but with only small
amounts of 2-methyl furan formed at high reaction temperatures
(ca. 290 °C). In strong contrast, furan is mainly produced from the
conversion of furfural by decarbonylation over Pd/SiO2, which is
capable of further reacting with hydrogen to give THF. For Ni/SiO2
catalyst, ring opening products such as butanal, butanol and butane
are observed in significant amounts [894]. Besides pentane, lighter
alkanes including C1, C2, C3, and C4 were also detected, which might
depend on the relative rates of C—C bond cleavage, dehydration and
hydrogenation reactions [895]. Notably, C6 alkane in minor per-
centages is observed in the products and was probably formed
through FT reactions [896]. Likewise, an aqueous-phase HDO of sor-
bitol to the gasoline-range products including C5—C6 alkanes, C2—C6
alcohols, THFs, tetrahydropyrans, and small amounts of C2—C6 al-
dehydes, ketones and organic acids could be realized in a continuous
flow reactor [897]. It was found that the gasoline-range yields on
Pt/Zr—P and Pt—ReOx/C were 67% and 44%, respectively. With respect
to the distribution of products, Pt—ReOx/C had a higher CO2 selec-
tivity than Pt/Zr—P, suggesting the Pt—ReOx/C showed a higher rate
of decarbonylation than Pt/Zr—P, while Pt/Zr—P had a higher rate
of C—O bond cleavage than Pt—ReOx/C, leading to a higher C6 product
selectivity (36% vs. 12%). With sorbitol as intermediate [898], a metal–
acid binary catalyst system composed of {Ir—ReOx/SiO2 + HZSM-5}
is effective in the one-pot conversion of cellulose in H2O/n-dodecane,
giving n-hexane yields of 83% and 78% from ball-milled cellulose
and microcrystalline cellulose, respectively [899]. The yield of
n-hexane remains above 70% even when ball-milled cellulose at a
water weight ratio of 1:1 is used. The hydrolysis of cellulose to
glucose via water-soluble oligosaccharides catalyzed by protons pro-
duced from HZSM-5 or hot water is considered to be the rate-
determining step. In a more fast reaction rate, glucose can
be hydrogenated to sorbitol over Ir—ReOx/SiO2, followed by
hydrogenolysis over Ir—ReOx/SiO2 and HZSM-5 to produce the end
product, n-hexane.

The use of extractive solvents like alkylphenol to separate GVL
from sulfuric acid following the LA hydrogenation step is an essen-
tial step for butene oligomerization [900]. The conversion of GVL
to aromatic hydrocarbons takes place over a zeolite catalyst at 500 °C,
and gives a carbon yield of 57% of aromatics from GVL with HZSM-5
(Si/Al: 25) catalyst [901]. To increase the length of carbon chains,
coupling and condensation reactions are involved [902,903]. Liu et
al. [904,905] developed an integrated catalytic process for the con-
version and upgrading of biomass feedstocks like fructose into 5,5′-
dihydroxymethyl furoin (DHMF), through self-coupling of HMF via
organocatalysis with a N-heterocyclic carbene, and subsequently into
n-C12H26 alkane over a bifunctional catalyst system consisting of {Pd/
C + acetic acid + La(OTf)3} via metal–acid tandem catalysis. In
particular, the third step HDO of DHMF is carried out with metal
(Pd/C)–acid (La(OTf)3) catalyst in acetic acid to afford 78% alkanes
with a 64% selectivity to n-C12H26 at 250 °C and 2.1 MPa H2 partial
pressure for 16 h. In combination with dehydration, aldol-
condensation/hydrogenation, and dehydration/hydrogenation
processing, Chheda and Dumesic [906] demonstrated the possibil-
ity of converting carbohydrate feedstocks to produce liquid alkanes
(Fig. 54). Initially, the catalytic hydrolysis reaction involves break-
ing C—O—C linkages to form simpler carbohydrate molecules at high
temperatures in the presence of acids. The resulting soluble car-
bohydrates could subsequently undergo acid-mediated dehydration
to produce furanic compounds (e.g., HMF and furfural) through loss
of three water molecules at moderate temperatures of 100–
200 °C. The subsequent aldol-condensation involving the C—C
coupling between two compounds containing carbonyl groups is
capable of forming larger organic molecules, which is generally
carried out over base catalysts at low temperatures in polar sol-
vents like water and water–methanol. Finally, the hydrogenation step
could saturate the C:C and C:O bonds of the aldol-adducts over a

metal catalyst, thus forming large water-soluble organic com-
pounds, followed by repeated dehydration and hydrogenation
reactions catalyzed by bifunctional materials containing acid and
metal sites to produce liquid alkanes in a four-phase reactor system.
Dedsuksophon et al. [907] reported that 15–20% maximum yields
of C5—C15 could be detected from tapioca flour and corncobs through
three sequential steps involving WO3—ZrO2 catalyzed hydrolysis/
dehydration at 300 °C for 5 min, aldol-condensation of HMF or
furfural with acetone at 80 °C within 30 h, and hydrogenation over
supported Pd particles at 120 °C after 6 h in a single pot. Notably,
the yields of hydrocarbon compounds increase with an increase in
reaction temperatures from 80 to 120 °C, but decrease at higher re-
action temperatures of 150 and 180 °C, which is possibly due to
further conversion or cracking of water-soluble organic compounds.

4.2.5.5. Cycloalkanes. Lignin-derived components are commonly used
as model chemicals for HDO to investigate possible reaction path-
ways and susceptibilities dominated by several typical oxygen
functionalities including hydroxyl groups bound to aromatic and ali-
phatic carbons and methoxy groups in phenolic compounds [908].
A large number of studies on hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of simple
aromatic compounds have been carried out, so as to facilitate the
valorization of lignin. For instance, the direct hydrogenation of phenol
to cyclohexanone is always hindered by over-reduction to
cyclohexanol, while the introduction of Lewis acid sites can se-
quentially enhance the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone
over palladium nanoparticles and inhibit further hydrogenation of

the ketone [909]. Deutsch et al. [910] found that the dehydration
of cyclohexanol derivatives was the rate limiting step in produc-
ing cyclohexane derivatives in the deoxygenation of phenols over
a copper chromite catalyst via hydrogenation, dehydration and hy-
drogenation. Likewise, the combination of noble metals (Ru, Rh and
Pt) supported on Al2O3 (or C) with solid acid zeolites tested for HDO
activity of the oligomeric technical lignins predominantly contain
8–O–4′ inter-unit linkages, to give 35–60% conversions of lignin with
65–70% product selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene
at 250 °C and 4–5 MPa for 8–12 h [911]. Specifically, high yields of
toluene (up to 100%) are obtained from the HDO of dibenzyl ether
at 250 °C and 10 MPa H2 partial pressure for 2 h when a sup-
ported FeS2 catalyst is used [912]. The chemical transformation of
FeS2 into Fe(1−x)S has been demonstrated to be responsible for the
high activity and selectivity gained in the conversion of dibenzyl
ether into toluene.

The one-pot dehydroxylation of phenols to arenes like benzene
can be realized by catalytic tandem reactions with 2-propanol as
an H-donor and concurrent use of Raney Ni and H-Beta-35 (Fig. 55)
[913]. The production of low boiling point arenes instead of high
boiling phenols from lignin can greatly facilitate the valorization of
lignin products by conventional refinery processes. Through a cleav-
age of C—O bonds in phenolics followed by an integrated metal- and
acid-catalyzed hydrogenation and dehydration, cycloalkanes-
containing transportation biofuels (>90% selectivities) are synthesized
from the full HDO of lignin-derived phenolic monomers and dimers
over a bifunctional catalyst of Ru supported in HZSM-5 at 200 °C

and 5 MPa H2 partial pressure after 4 h [914]. However, issues on
the recycling of catalysts for complex catalytic systems at relative-
ly high temperatures (200–250 °C) are not commonly studied and
it is likely that the structure of these heterogeneous catalysts
becomes deactivated with time due to the formation of chars or
humins and adsorption on the catalytic surfaces.

5. Other bifunctional materials and catalytic routes

Catalytic transformation of biomass into chemicals products via
chemical routes has been reviewed and analyzed [915], and updated
in follow-up studies [916–918]. Fuel cells coupled with biomass-
derived fuel processors are able to provide renewable energy and
chemicals in a CO2-neutral manner [919]. Electrocatalytic oxida-
tion of glucose has been extensively studied, since this reaction has
applications in glucose–air fuel cells as well as in medical and food
industries as glucose sensors [920–924].

5.1. Metals (Au, Ag, Cd, Ru, Pt, Pd, Cu, Ni) dispersed into nano-sized
particles

Gold dispersed into nano-sized scale particles or alloyed with
other metals normally has high stability and enhanced activity in
electrocatalytic glucose oxidation [925–930], in which gluconic acid
can be the final product [931]. Noble metals like Ag, Cd, Ru, Pt, and
Pd have been developed for this catalytic process [932–935], while
more attention has been paid to non-precious metal (e.g., Cu and
Ni) catalysts [936–939]. Carbohydrates including mannose, galac-
tose, fructose, arabinose and xylose can be detected through
electrocatalytic oxidation [940–942], and some interesting sugar
transformations such as simultaneous production of xylitol and
xylonic acid from xylose, isomerization of lactose into lactulose,

hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol or 2-deoxysorbitol, and oxi-
dation of sorbitol to fructose and sorbose can be realized via electro-
catalytic processes [943–946]. In parallel, electro-oxidative cleavage
of lignin is likely to be achieved through disruption of biphenyl link-
ages (a), diphenylether linkages (b), dibenzylether linkages (c), β-O-4
linkages (d), β-5 linkages (e), β–β linkages (f) and β-1 couplings (g)
(Fig. 56) [947], and further upgrading of the lignin monomers is pos-
sibly through electrocatalytic hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation [948].
The coupling of sequential electrocatalytic processes generally in-
volving degradation of biopolymers to small molecules and
subsequent hydrogenation/oxidation appears to be one of effi-
cient ways for the direct transformation of biomass resources into
biofuels and value-added chemicals.

In comparing the upgrading of biomass-derived platform mol-
ecules with heterogeneous catalysts, electrochemical catalysis offers
relatively high selectivity of products and increased reaction rates.
In electrochemical catalysis, the electrode potential and the Fara-
daic current are two additional external control parameters that allow
tuning of the thermodynamic driving force and activation energy
[949]. Over supported metal nanoparticles (e.g., Au and Pd), the
electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF in alkaline media was able to se-
lectively produce FDCA at high selectivity giving trace amounts of
DFF [950], while the corresponding hydrogenation reactions give
BHMF, BHMTF or even DMF in neutral or acidic solutions [951–953].
For furfural, attention has been paid to electrocatalytic reduction
to synthesize the dominant product FfA in different reaction media
[954–957], and THFA, MF and MTHF are found to form in a con-
tinuous electrocatalytic membrane reactor [958]. When substrate
is selected as LA, the electrocatalytic hydrogenation in parallel with
the heterogeneous bifunctional catalysts-mediated chemical process
produced GVL or valeric acid in high yields [959–962]. Likewise, a
series of organic acids or aldehydes can probably be produced from

electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass derived alcohols such as ethanol,
ethylene glycol, and glycerol [963–968].

can be coupled with fuel cell to provide renewable energy in the
future.

5.2. Cascade reactions with enzymes and electrocatalytic methods

Combining an enzyme, oxalate oxidase, with an organic oxida-
tion catalyst, 4-amino-TEMPO can allow the complete electrochemical
oxidation of the biofuel glycerol to CO2 (Fig. 57) [969]. In this hybrid
cascade process, TEMPO-NH2 catalyzes the oxidation of glycerol to
mesoxalic acid, while a combination of oxalate oxidase and TEMPO-
NH2 transforms mesoxalic acid to glyoxalic acid, oxalic acid, and finally
CO2. Importantly, CO2 possibly captured from the ambient air [970]
might be able to be directly employed in biomass processing [971]
or hydrogenated to form a range of carbon-rich fuels like CO, oxalate,
formic acid, and methanol via electrochemical catalysis [972–974].
The production of hydrogen can also be realized from water elec-
trolysis or reforming of renewable chemicals such as glucose and
ethanol [975–977]. Many types of biomass-derived fuels (e.g., ethanol,
biodiesel and biogas) as well as bio-based chemicals (e.g., HMF, glyc-
erol and LA) can be used as the feedstock for a fuel processor that

The combination of biocatalysis with inorganic catalysis is a
method for one-pot conversion of biomass-related feedstocks [978].
Vennestrøm et al. [979] provide examples on combined enzyme and
chemical catalysts for the production of commodity chemicals from
renewable feedstocks. In the case of oxidase enzymes-mediated re-
actions, oxygen was reduced to hydrogen peroxide. Pyranose oxidase,
which is an oxidase enzyme, catalyzes the oxidation of aldopyranoses
to form 2-keto sugars and H2O2 [980], and a combined chemical hy-
drogenation as a second step is capable of producing fructose from
glucosone (2-keto sugar) [981]. In fact, isomerase is able to sepa-
rately realize the glucose-to-fructose conversion [982,983]. An
integrated enzyme cascade-chemocatalytic transformation of cel-
lulose oligomers into HMF (up to 46% yield) has been achieved in
aqueous (enzyme) and organic (chemical) media with enzyme and
acid functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), re-
spectively (Fig. 58) [984]. The catalytic process generally involves
thermophilic glucose isomerase enzyme for glucose isomeriza-
tion to fructose and an acid catalyst for fructose dehydration to HMF

[985,986]. After further introduction of an HMF/furfural oxidore-
ductase into the catalytic systems, FDCA and furoic acid are formed
from hexoses and pentoses, respectively [987–989]. HMF and fur-
fural can be successively hydrogenated into BHMF and FfA through
anaerobic biotransformation by using the aldehyde (—CHO) as an
electron acceptor [990,991]. Biotransformation appears to enhance
overall metabolic capacity of other anaerobic bacteria (e.g., sulfate-
reducing bacteria and acetogenic bacteria) in anaerobic digestion
processes, demonstrating that synergetic effects exist among dif-
ferent enzymes. The introduction of chemo-catalytic methods can
play a valuable role in both upstream and downstream processing
of biomass by improving efficiency and selectivity of target products.
Chemo-enzymatic routes have been developed to produce other
biomass-derived chemicals. For instance, GVL can be produced from
LA with an integrated bioprocessing system involving the produc-
tion of intermediate 4-hydroxyvaleric acid from LA with an
intracellular enzyme P. putida, and subsequent lactonization that
occurs extracytosolically in acidic medium (Fig. 59) [992]. In a 2 L
bioreactor, the production of 4-hydroxyvalerate and GVL from
levulinate have been examined, and titers of 27.1 g L−1 and 8.2 g L−1
are achieved for the two respective compounds. Immobilized lipase
B from Candida antarctica not only afforded a high yield of GVL (90%)
from LA via EL as intermediate promoted by Amberlyst-15, but also
exhibits a remarkable enantiomeric excess of the desired (S)-GVL
(>99% ee) [993]. In the overall process, catalyst recycle is possible
especially in the case of Amberlyst-15 and C. Antarctica. Moreover,
organic solvents used in the extraction or reaction can be reused
after distillation, leading to an overall decrease in waste produc-
tion. Starting from the same substrate LA, 2-butanone is obtained

by acetoacetate decarboxylase from Clostridium acetobutylicum [994].
In this catalytic system, mediators such as methyl viologen and 2,2′-
azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) are capable of
accepting the overcrowded electrons around carboxylate group of
LA and of assisting spontaneous electron flow from β- to γ-carbon.
Through corresponding chemo-enzymatic catalysis, biorefinery prod-
ucts like methyl ethyl ketone, methane, polyhydroxyalkanoates,
xylogluco-oligosaccharides, and starch can be produced from non-
edible biomass [995–1000]. The combination of chemical and
enzymatic catalysis can be used to integrate cascade reactions in
a single pot, thus avoiding the separation of intermediates from the
reaction mixtures and maintaining the separate advantages of the
two different catalytic systems for efficient biomass transformations.
Photocatalysis shows good potential for transformation of lig-
nocellulosic biomass to valuable products [1001]. The rapid
elucidation of reaction routes mediated by functional catalytic ma-
terials can widen the scope of biomass transformations.

6. Auxiliary processes to boost catalytic efficiency

In multi-catalytic processes involving biomass conversion, cat-
alyst selectivity, on some level, is a function of the ratio and
distribution of active sites for both heterogeneous and homoge-
neous reactions. For the case of Lewis–Bronsted acid-mediated
hydrolysis and dehydration processes, presence of Lewis acid sites
responsible for sugar isomerization is necessary to accelerate the
thermokinetic performance. However, catalysts with excess of Lewis
acid sites often lead to a decrease in product selectivity that is as-
sociated with the formation of humins [1002,1003]. Therefore,

suitable adjustment of active site distribution is one of the key issues
in realizing high product selectivity. Several other factors like re-
action media, diffusion limitations, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic
environment of the solid catalysts are also important in determin-
ing the performance of catalytic systems [1004]. In these past few
years, much attention has been paid to developing integrated cata-
lytic processes for direct conversion of waste biomass, algae, and
energy crops into desired compounds like food, proteins, sugars, poly-
mers, platform chemicals, and liquid fuels. Nevertheless, solid–
solid interactions between biomass and solid catalysts are necessary
for the lignocellulose substrates to degrade. As such, coupling pre-
treatment processes with suitable auxiliaries like heating modes may
boost biomass valorization.

6.1. Biomass pretreatment

Biomass pretreatment can breakdown or weaken the tight link-
ages among cell-wall components of lignocellulosic biomass, thus
enhancing its degradation in subsequent upgrading stages
[1005,1006]. Typical physical pretreatment methods are milling, chip-
ping, grinding and thermal treatment that decrease particle size and
crystallinity of biomass, but consume much energy [1007]. Biolog-
ical pretreatment can enhance delignification and enzymatic
digestibility of lignocellulosic substrates, while it is time-consuming
and expensive [1008–1010]. For the case of chemical pretreat-
ment, acid-catalyzed processes are capable of increasing the porosity
of substrates through breakage of covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds,
and van der Waals forces in biomass [1011,1012], while alkali can
destroy linkages between lignin and carbohydrates by saponifica-
tion of intermolecular ester bonds [1013]. However, these two
processes are usually accompanied with equipment corrosion, for-
mation of side products, and issues in the recovery and recycle of
acids and bases.

6.1.1. Molten salt hydrates and dual metal salts

Molten salt hydrates including ZnCl2, CaCl2, and LiCl are able to
convert cellulose and hemicellulose into monosaccharides at mild
conditions in water, wherein the strong interaction between the ionic
species and hydroxyls promotes cleavage of the hydrogen-bonding
network [1014]. Traditional solvents like cadoxen/water, DMSO/
tetrabutylammonium fluoride, NaOH/urea, and LiCl/DMA can be used
either for biomass pretreatment or directly for cellulose dissolu-
tion [1015–1018], but these solvents have several drawbacks such
as volatility or generation of toxic gases and the need for multi-
step and prolonged process operations. Due to their low vapor
pressure and high solvation capacity, ILs have attracted much at-
tention for the homogeneous processing of lignocelluloses
[1019–1023]. Some challenges such as high solvent cost, limited toxi-
cological data, and regeneration requirements of ILs still remain to
be addressed before they can be widely used in biomass valoriza-
tion processes [1024–1027].

Chemical pretreatment of biomass has been widely studied. In
particular, some chemical agents like peroxides and high pressure

oxygen, which can dissolve lignin and loosen the remaining hemi-
cellulose from insoluble crystalline cellulose, have gained increasing
interest [1028–1030]. For example, sugarcane bagasse pretreated
in combination of dual metal salts such as MnSO4·H2O and ZnO with
H2O2 allows cellulose recovery and delignification, thus enhanc-
ing the downstream ethanol production [1031].

6.1.2. Preoxidation–hydrolysis

Two-step preoxidation–hydrolysis strategy can transform cel-
lulose into glucose (Fig. 60), in which the hydroxymethyl group is
first oxidized to a carboxyl group by preoxidation treatment using
air as an oxidant, and reduction of the polymerization degree of cel-
lulose as well as the subsequent cellulose-to-glucose hydrolysis is
realized with the in-situ generated acid sites [1032]. The combi-
nation of chemical or biological pretreatment with irradiation
including microwave, ultrasound, gamma-ray, and electron beam
can provide more efficient results than a single pretreatment method
that only possesses limited specific functioning mode and intrin-
sic disadvantages. In this case, alkali pretreatment integrated with
ultrasound or microwave is able to enhance the removal of lignin
from lignocelluloses [1033–1035]. Similarly, ultrasound-promoted
IL pretreatment [1036] and acid catalyzed steam treatment [1037]
can increase the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass. Other related
techniques for treating a broad range of biomass feedstocks for the
production of biofuels are provided in a review [1038].

6.2. Reaction media

Lignocellulosic biomass is mainly nonmelting solid material before
decomposition and charring occur in thermocatalytic processes. As such,
it is necessary to use a suitable reaction medium for controlled depo-
lymerization of lignocelluloses, as well as for subsequent upgrading of
solvent–soluble components and stabilization of products. Water is po-
tentially a green and cheap solvent for the conversion of biomass to
specific products although most biopolymers have low solubility in
water [1039–1041]. However, water at high temperatures (ca. 250 °C)
or at supercritical conditions (>375 °C, >22.1 MPa) can enhance the deg-
radation of biopolymers despite selectivity is typically low [1042–1045].
For the dissolution, fractionation and valorization of lignocellulosic
biomass components, ILs are considered to be promising candidates
[1046–1049]. Particularly, metal chlorides in chloride-based ILs are
robust catalytic systems for efficient conversion of cellulose, hemicel-
luloses, and lignin [1050]. In the case of transformation of sugars to
furanic compounds in ILs, the presence of Cl− ions can promote the for-
mation of the 1,2-enediol from the acyclic form of sugars, resulting in
a significant improvement of catalytic activity [1051,1052], while metal
cations play role in sugar isomerizations to facilitate succedent dehy-
dration [1053]. Adding a certain amount of water into ILs-mediated
reaction media seems to raise the hydrolysis efficiency of biopoly-
mers, thus increasing the yields of furan-type compounds, but too much
water promotes rehydration of products [1054–1056]. Likewise, the ad-
dition of DMSO lowers the high viscosity of ILs to facilitate the mass
transfer between the catalyst and substrate without affecting solubility

172

H. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 98–194

of biopolymers [1057–1059], and also enhances the stability of
mono-saccharides [1060] and products such as HMF and EMF
[1061,1062]. However, other high boiling organic solvents such as DMA
and N,N-dimethylformamide are not so selective for the desired prod-
ucts, and metal chlorides are required for DMA [1063–1065]. An NMR
study showed that DMSO is likely to act as a catalyst besides a solvent
for fructose-to-HMF dehydration at 150 °C via an intermediate (4R,5R)-
4-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl- 4,5-dihydrofuran-2-carbaldehyde [1066].
The functional IL 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
used as a catalyst, rather than as solvent can directly promote glucose
dehydration in DMSO, giving HMF in yields as high as 67% at 180 °C
within 1 h [1067]. In contrast, SO3H-functionalized ILs in water or ethanol
will lead to the formation of LA or EL from sugars via HMF or EMF re-
hydration, respectively [1068–1070]. As an effective way to improve LA
yields, metal salts like NaCl and KCl can interrupt the hydrogen bonding
network of cellulose at high temperatures and pressures, thus facili-
tating hydrolysis, dehydration, and rehydration processes [1071].
Moreover, the subsequent esterification of LA with long chain alco-
hols can facilitate the separation of product for reuse of ILs [1072].

In the context, ILs and DMSO are two important reaction media
to control or increase the selectivity of products especially furanic
compounds. Nevertheless, ILs are still expensive and have limited
applications in scale-up processes for biomass, while DMSO which
has a high boiling point of 189 °C requires much energy in its sep-
aration from the products. As such, organic solvents with a moderate
volatility seem to be promising alternatives [1073,1074]. In a mono-
phasic THF–water system, increased reaction performance, for either
furans or for LA is observed [1075–1078]. Notably, the increase of
electrical conductivity of water to THF can be achieved with the dis-
solution of a small amount of ionic material like NaCl, rendering
the formation of a biphasic system that will promote the in-situ sep-
aration of products like HMF and furfural from aqueous mixture
[1079–1081]. Other organic solvents such as toluene, MIBK, ace-
tonitrile, alcohols, and their mixtures have also been widely utilized
as extractive phases [1082–1087]. Among them, the use of water-
miscible solvents as organic phase is expected to dissolve HMF better
than common non-water-miscible solvents. Biomass-derived sol-
vents like MTHF, alkylphenols and GVL have been proposed as
sustainable co-solvents or extraction solvents [1088–1090]. In par-
ticular, GVL with water used as the reaction medium can mediate
the formation of monosaccharides, furfural, HMF, and even GVL di-
rectly from corresponding biomass derivatives [1091–1094]. It is
interesting to note that solvent or catalyst may act as a reagent to
directly influence product distributions. Considering LA upgrad-
ing in dimethylcarbonate as an example, K2CO3 can catalyze the
formation of methyl levulinate through methylation, as well as the
subsequent dimethylketal to produce dimethyl succinate at 200 °C
after 4 h [1095]. In this catalytic process, dimethylcarbonate is not
only a solvent but also a reagent under a basic condition. Either HCl
or HBr as an acid catalyst may react with the desired product HMF
to yield a more stable compound 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF) or
5-bromomethylfurfural (BMF) [1096,1097].

6.3. Control of functional materials

Apart from selecting suitable biomass pretreatment and reac-
tion media, design of an optimal catalytic system including the type
of reactor and heating, as well as catalyst itself is needed to achieve
the efficient and selective transformation of biomass into desired
products [1098–1100]. From the preceding sections, it can be seen
that much emphasis has been placed on the preparation and ap-
plication of the multifunctional catalysts containing acid/base sites
and/or metal particles for biomass processing. After modification
with selected functional groups [1101–1103], the resulting multi-
functional catalytic materials have many possibilities for efficiently
converting biomass through:

(1) combination of several types of active sites within a unique
solid catalyst that are incompatible in a homogeneous phase;
(2) combination of complex transformations in a single pot

process;

(3) implementation of cascade reactions and multistep conver-

sions; and

(4) elimination of intermediate separation and purification steps.

There are a number of common characteristics of the catalytic
materials such as porosity and surface polarity important in cata-
lyst design that discussed in the next sections.

6.3.1. Porosity

Porosity of solid materials directly affects surface area. Porous
materials that have high surface areas with highly accessible active
sites are crucial for substrate sorption and high activity. In general,
most of the catalytic sites of porous materials are located inside the
pore system, and the reaction selectivity can be controlled because
of the size limitation between pores and reagents, products or
transition-states [1104]. It seems that the best choice for catalytic
processes of large molecules is mesoporous and macroporous ma-
terials [1105]. Unlike micropores which hinder the contact of
substrate and active sites, if pores are too large to offer the steric
restrictions, it will reduce the transition-state selectivity. Careful se-
lection of functionalized materials and tailoring of the pore sizes
are necessary to overcome the mass transfer limitations in the pro-
cessing of polymeric species. Ordered porous materials such as metal
oxides and carbonaceous materials with narrow pore size distri-
bution show enhanced selectivity in some cases for sugar and lignin
chemistry [1106,1107]. Metal oxides are not resistant to aqueous
reaction media, while they are stable on carbon supports with ex-
clusive micropores that appear to be unsuitable for conversion of
polymeric biomolecules. Biomass-derived mesoporous carbons with
well-defined pore architecture are preferable for applications in the
catalytic conversion of biomass [1108,1109]. Modified zeolites and
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with well-tailored pore sizes and
active sites are promising candidates [1110–1113].

6.3.2. Surface polarity

Catalytic transformation of biomass via multiple steps may se-
quentially involve hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules. Therefore,
the proper adjustment of the adsorption and desorption pro-
cesses between active sites and reagents is necessary to optimize
the overall catalytic performance [1114]. Normally, the surface po-
larity of solid materials is affected by their own surface groups such
as hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, alkyl, ether, and ionic species. In most
cases, functional materials with hydrophilic surfaces can facilitate
the access of the substrates bearing many hydroxyl groups and the
desorption of the hydrophobic products, thus simultaneously op-
timizing catalytic activity and selectivity. Notably, water as a
convenient dispersant for lignocellulosic materials [1115] can be
generated in situ by dehydration and hydrogenolysis, while it is likely
to cause poisoning of active sites [1116]. From the discussion above,
solid functional catalysts with high water tolerance, adjusted surface
polarity, and tailored porosity can enhance efficiency in transfor-
mations to a large degree. Paramagnetic and nano-sized materials
have also been suggested as methods in catalyst design, however
these materials are still in their infancy stage, regarding their uni-
formity, recyclability and accessibility [1117–1119].

6.4. Heating modes including microwave and ultrasound

In past decades, valorization of biomass using conventional
heating modes, especially pyrolysis, has been extensively investi-
gated. A wide range of feedstocks ranging from organic residues to
biopolymers have been studied and simple scale-up for pyrolysis

H. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 98–194

173

is possible, while high energy consumption (T > 600 °C) and low
quality products containing the formation of polycyclic aromatic hy-
drocarbons and CO2 are issues that require urgent attention [1120].
In this respect, microwave irradiation can offer appropriate process
control by its instantaneous heating mode with rapid and conve-
nient start-up and shutdown, thus facilitating the adjustment of
reaction parameters such as time, temperature and power for
biomass processing [1121,1122]. In microwave processes, both
thermal and non-thermal effects are often involved in processing
of biomass. In the overall heating process, the rapid rise in tem-
perature resulting from microwave irradiation causes the
vaporization of intramolecular water contained in biomass, hence
increasing the intra-particle pressure to loosen the structure of bio-
polymers by expansion [1123]. The destructive effect of ultrasound
causes generation of rapidly expanding and contracting water
bubbles within the lignocellulosic units, leading to the compres-
sion and extension of the particles [1124]. Both microwave and
ultrasound are promising auxiliaries for increasing the contact area
between solid bifunctional catalysts and lignocellulosic substrates
and still need to be studied for many reaction systems [1125,1126].
Apart from biomass pretreatment using microwave or ultra-
sound irradiation, the combination of hydrothermal conditions with
microwave irradiation involving moderate temperatures of 100–
200 °C has been demonstrated to be applicable to the transformation
of many kinds of lignocellulosic biomass into molecules with a high
degree of functionality [1127]. Xie et al. [1128] found that Ni/
Al2O3 was effective for tar removal and for the fast microwave-
assisted gasification of corn stover at 900 °C, in which syngas in a
yield above 80% was produced. Little change in the structure of Ni/
Al2O3 catalyst was detected with XRD (X-ray diffraction) even after
being reused for three times, indicating the good stability of the
nickel based catalyst to resist the deactivation caused by coking or
sintering. With the assistance of char as microwave absorber, rapid
heat-up to high temperatures within seconds can be achieved in
the pyrolysis of oil palm biomass (shell and fibers) [1128]. In par-
ticular, the yields and rapid heating of microwave pyrolysis products
such as bio-oils, chars, and gases are closely dependent on the ratio
of biomass substrate to microwave absorber [1129]. Furthermore,
biomass in large particle sizes is able to be used directly in micro-
wave heating, hence saving the cost of grinding and moisture
removal.

In the presence of activated carbon under the reaction condi-
tions of temperature and retention time varied with a fixed
microwave power input of 700 W, bio-oils with high concentra-
tions of phenol (39%) and phenolics (67%) are obtained in the
catalytic microwave pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, while a high
concentration of esters (42%) is obtained in a formic acid/ethanol
reaction medium using Zn powder as catalyst [1130]. It is appar-
ent that fossil fuel substitutes are likely to be generated from biomass
pyrolysis assisted and enhanced with microwave irradiation [1131].
In parallel, the microwave-assisted conversion of carbohydrates to
make a wide range of sugar-derivative scaffolds has been pro-
posed [1132].

In comparison to conventional oil bath heating mode (100 °C,
10 h), microwave irradiation at a power of 400 W was able to sig-
nificantly reduce the reaction time (8 min) with increased yields
of reducing sugars (7% vs. 48%) in the hydrolysis of cellulose over
a solid acid like HY(5) [1133]. To some extent, this microwave-
assisted catalytic system is capable of simplifying the downstream
processing. Related studies on the efficient and rapid production of
LA and furans (e.g., HMF and furfural) from simple sugars and even
lignocellulosic biomass with microwave well confirm the promo-
tion effect of such the microwave heating mode [1134–1137]. Both
microwave and ultrasound show enhanced activity on the direct
transesterification of the as-harvested algae biomass [1138], which
was illustrated to be realized by accelerating the disruption of the

microalgae cells to promote oil release [1139]. With respect to the
production of biodiesel from as-prepared oils with the assistance
of base, acid and/or enzyme functionalized catalysts, ultrasound can
promote the mass transfer of immiscible reactants, thus shorten-
ing reaction time [1140,1141]. Nevertheless, ultrasound is less
efficient for transesterification than magnetic stirring at a low
methanol/oil ratio of <7/1 and temperature of 65 °C, but could tol-
erate excess methanol (>7/1) through vaporizing some of methanol
caused by the effect of ultrasonic cavitation [1142]. Enzymatic hy-
drolysis of lignocelluloses for bioethanol production can be
intensified with ultrasound [1143,1144], with biodiesel and
bioethanol being favorably produced from different fractions of
biomass.

7. Conclusions and future outlook

Bifunctional catalytic materials have been demonstrated to have
outstanding potential in producing chemicals and biofuels effi-
ciently and with high selectivity through multi-step conversions of
biomass in one-pot processes. The role of basicity or Lewis acidity
is mainly in sugar isomerization, as well as in upgrading of plat-
form molecules through condensation and Diels–Aldol reactions.
Simultaneous addition or presence of strong Bronsted acid sites ac-
celerates the process of dehydration and oxygen removal. By
introducing noble metals or transition metals into acid-initiated re-
actions, the oxygen removal capacity can be further enhanced
through hydrolytic hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis, notably, de-
carboxylation reactions may occur at relatively high temperatures.
On the contrary, some types of oxygenates can be produced from
bio-based small molecules over base–metal dual-functional cata-
lysts, or directly from biomass derivatives promoted by acid–
metal dual active sites. However, incompatibility issues associated
with competing reactions are often obstacles to increasing product
selectivity. For example, the catalytic production of hydrogenated
furanic compounds from mono-saccharides is likely to be realized
through cascade dehydration–hydrogenation. In fact, hexitols such
as sorbitol and mannitol are generally formed as dominant prod-
ucts through direct hydrogenation of sugars rather than HMF or
furfural in-situ generated by water-removing processes. In this
regards, several points affecting biomass valorization may be taken
into consideration for the establishment of well-defined catalytic
systems, associated with bifunctionality and relevant auxiliaries:

(1) According to specific reactions, the rate of Bronsted/Lewis acid
sites should be well adjusted so as to suppress the forma-
tion of humins or byproducts. Besides optimizing catalyst
composition, the coverage of undesirable catalytic sites with
other chemical species in a bond-binding mode could be
applied as a technique in catalyst design.

(2) The coexistence of acid and base sites can be realized by con-
currently immobilizing them into a solid material. However,
the acid/base strength and content are limited with this ap-
proach, owing to the possible neutralization caused by [H+]
liberation or leaching. In this case, the choice of appropriate
solvents is important to inhibit this phenomenon. Discrete
distribution of base and acid sites into different fractions (e.g.,
core/shell) of a solid catalyst may be another way to address
this issue.

(3) The incompatibility of cascade reactions catalyzed by acid–
metal bifunctional materials can be undoubtedly overcome
by controlling the pressure of H2/O2, hydrophilicity and hy-
drophobicity of catalysts, size/dispersion of metals, acid type/
strength, and reaction time/temperature. Therefore, the
reaction parameters must be considered with the most im-
portant ones being applicable for selective transformation of
biomass via multiple catalytic processes.

(4) In general, base–metal dual-functional catalysts are highly
active for oxidation reactions, but rarely employed for multi-
catalytic processes. In view of their basicity, the coupling of
biomass pretreatment with succedent hydrogenation should
find many new applications.

(5) Apart from organocatalysis, the valorization of biomass de-
rivatives through chemoenzymatic and electrochemical
catalysis has been developed in recent years. Within all of
these catalytic systems, biomass pretreatment is a vital step
to achieve high digestibility, productivity and practicality. It
can be expected that there will be an increase in use of
chemoenzymatic and electrochemical catalysis methods to
understand catalyst functionality as well as to develop unique
transformation systems for biomass valorization.

(6) As to the general characteristics of catalysts, functionality in
aqueous systems, recoverability and dispersibility can be en-
hanced by innovative material composites, such as the
introduction of paramagnetic cores and nano-sizing of the ma-
terials. Improvements in catalyst uniformity, stability and
recyclability are essential for bifunctional catalytic systems
to realize industrial practicality.

(7) Although bifunctional catalysts still requires experimental
trials for their effective development, computational methods
(e.g., DFT and ab initio methods) can provide some guid-
ance into the inclusion of catalytic sites and insight into
preferred configurations or site arrangements.

In conclusion, bifunctional catalytic materials have many ad-
vantages over monofunctional catalysts in efficiency and in simplicity
of operation. Bifunctional catalytic materials will play a vital role
in the development of efficient biorefinery production systems al-
though their large-scale application will depend on catalyst stability,
product selectivity, and possibly the use of creative auxiliaries such
as reactor design and heating modes. Many opportunities exist for
developing bifunctional catalytic materials on both fundamental and
applied levels. The numerous studies presented in this review serve
as the foundation for realizing practical multi-catalytic processes
with bifunctional catalytic materials.
