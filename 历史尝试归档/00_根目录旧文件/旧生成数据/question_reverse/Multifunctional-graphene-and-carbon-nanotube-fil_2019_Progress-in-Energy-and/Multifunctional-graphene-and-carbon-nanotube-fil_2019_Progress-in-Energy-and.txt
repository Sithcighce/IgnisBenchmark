Graphene and carbon nanotubes, featured with outstanding electronic, photonic and mechanical prop-
erties as well as Earth abundancy, are perfect for use as carrier-selective transport and collecting layers
in photovoltaics. In recent years, graphene and carbon nanotube films have underpinned significant ad-
vancement in the planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells, with reduced fabrication cost, improved power
conversion efficiencies approaching 20%, and the great potential for scalable deployment. Here we dis-
cuss the state-of-art progress in graphene-based and carbon nanotube-based PHJ solar cells leveraging
advanced nanocarbon technologies as well as industrial-compatible solar cell design and processing. Fab-
rication and functionalization strategies of graphene and carbon nanotube films for electronic and pho-
tonic optimization of PHJ solar cells are systematically reviewed. We also envision technological pathways
and future prospects to exploit multifunctionality of graphene and carbon nanotubes to realize ubiquitous
application of high-performance, flexible PHJ solar cells.

ture. As shown in Fig. 1 , a typical planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar
cell has three main components: a top electrode layer (or emit-
ter) to create built-in potential for separating electron-hole pairs
and selectively transporting electrons/holes, a photoactive layer to
absorb  solar  energy  and  generate  electron-hole  pairs,  as  well  as
a bottom electrode layer (or base) to collect holes/electrons. The
valence-band electrons in the photoactive material are excited by
absorbing photons with energy greater than the bandgap energy,
generating electron-hole pairs. The electric field at the junction be-
tween top electrode and photoactive layer separates the electron-
hole pairs; the holes are then collected by the top electrode once
they  drift  to  the  junction.  The  circuit  completes  once  the  holes
pass through the load and meet up the electrons in the photoac-
tive layer. Compared with p–n homojunction solar cells, PHJ solar
cells have a simpler structure and do not require high-temperature
dopant diffusion processes, which allows compatible and scalable
manufacturing and reduces fabrication cost up to 30% [1–3] . The
PHJ structure holds the promise to further improve PCE and de-
crease fabrication cost, thereby paving the way of realizing scale-
up deployment of photovoltaics as a renewable source of electric-
ity.

Currently, the most commercially competitive photoactive ma-
terials for PHJ solar cells include crystalline silicon (c-Si), cadmium
telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and per-
ovskite  materials.  The  highest  power  conversion  efficiency  (PCE)
values  achieved  for  c-Si,  CdTe  and  CIGS  solar  cells  so  far  are
26.3%, 22.1% and 21.7% [4] , respectively, approaching the theoret-
ical Shockley–Queisser thermodynamic limit. In recent years, the
PCE of lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased from
3.8% [5] to 22.1% [6] since its first embodiment in 2009. It is worth
mentioning that, although the absolute value of PCE is the most
sought-after  and  eye-catching  property  of  a  solar  cell  in  labora-
tory, it is only part of the big picture for industrial-scale applica-
tion which incorporates stability, scalability, uncertainty, risk, cost
and life cycle.

Photovoltaics are expected to be market-competitive and ready
for subsidy-free utility-scale adoption at module costs of US$0.50–
0.75 W -1 , which results in a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of
US$0.06/kWh, comparable to the current fossil fuel-based electrical
utility plants. With 75 GW installation in 2016, c-Si is dominating
the solar-cell market, taking up to 93% of market share [7] . Cur-
rently, the estimated manufacturing cost of c-Si PV is US$1.29 W -1 ,
which is approaching the target but still has space for further cost
reduction. Other inorganic photoactive materials such as CdTe and
CIGS utilize less photoactive semiconductor material per watt than
c-Si, however, both are expensive and contain rare-earth materi-
als, and have issues in toxicity. Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite
materials have low formation energies for deposition and are com-
patible with low-cost, scalable manufacturing techniques such as
roll-to-roll  printing,  spray  coating,  inkjet  printing,  etc .  However,
the low PCE stability ( < 10 0 0 h), toxicity (contains lead) and high

material cost are intrinsically limiting future prospect of PSCs, re-
quiring magnificent amount of investment in laboratory-scale re-
search as well as decades of learning curve in industry-scale instal-
lation and deployment. Therefore, c-Si and GaAs, which have been
through the process of perfection in material quality and matura-
tion in production line [8] , have the highest technology readiness
level, with superiorities over perovskite materials in terms of long-
term  durability,  low  toxicity,  abundant  raw  material  supply  and
manufacturability for cells and modules.

The  current  module  cost  of  c-Si  could  be  further  reduced
by  improving  the  photoactive  material  feedstock  utilization  and
using  cost-effective  and  eco-friendly  top  electrode  materials,
which  accounts  for  ca .  60%  of  the  total  module  cost  [2] .  In  a
PHJ  solar  cell,  the  top  electrode  layer  is  required  to  have  high
electrical  conductivity  and  optical  transparency  simultaneously,
with  appropriate  electronic  band  structure  and  Fermi  level  po-
sition  matching  the  used  photoactive  layer.  These  requirements
are  usually  realized  by  a  double-layer  design  comprising  of  a
transparent  conductive  film  (TCF)  and  a  selective  hole/electron
transport layer, as shown in Fig. 1 b. The conventional materials for
TCFs are noble metal grids (such as silver and gold) and rare-earth
metal oxides (such as indium-doped tin oxide, ITO). However, the
elemental scarcity and high cost potentially prevent their use at
scale. For the selective hole/electron transport layer, the commonly
used materials are conductive organic materials such as poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene
(PEDOT:PSS)
and  lithium  bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide-doped  2,2 (cid:3) ,7,7 (cid:3) -
tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenylamine)-9,9 (cid:3) -spirobifluorene  (spiro
-OMeTAD:LiTFSI).  PEDOT:PSS  and  spiro-OMeTAD:LiTFSI  are  in-
homogeneous  dispersions  which  suffer  from  instability  and
degradation of electrical conductivity [9] . Additionally, PEDOT:PSS
is  highly  acidic  (pH ∼1)  which  may  corrode  ITO  and  other  com-
ponents  in  PHJ  solar  cells.  Therefore,  it  is  highly  desirable  to
develop new materials for the top electrode layers of the PHJ solar
cells.

Graphene  and  single-walled  carbon  nanotubes  (SWNTs)  are
atomic-thin sp 2  hybridized nanocarbon materials. The strong co-
valent π bonds in graphene and SWNTs enable ballistic electron
and phonon transport, excellent mechanical strength and flexibil-
ity, as well as good chemical inertness and stability. The excellent
physical properties of graphene and carbon nanotubes makes them
fundamentally suitable for PHJ solar cells. As shown in Fig. 1 c, a
prototype nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cell is constructed by a pho-
toactive  layer  sandwiched  by  a  thin  nanocarbon  film  as  emitter
and a rear metal electrode. The nanocarbon film serves as both the
transparent conductive layer and the hole collecting layer, which
could effectively simplify the PHJ structure. The Fermi level of the
nanocarbon film could be shifted through doping, even for metal-
lic  SWNTs  and  graphene  which  behaves  metallic.  Therefore,  the
quantum nature of the nanocarbon materials determines that the
nanocarbon-Si junction is a planar heterojunction (PHJ) rather than

Graphene  and  carbon  nanotubes  also  have  excellent  process
flexibility and compatibility with solar cell device fabrication flow.
The nanocarbon films could be functionalized, processed and as-
sembled independently, and transferred onto the photoactive sub-
strate at room temperature through scalable deposition methods
including roll-to-roll printing, gravure printing, spray coating, spin
coating,  etc .  The  decoupled  processing  of  nanocarbon-based  PHJ
solar  cells  provides  more  freedom  in  design  of  solar  cells  and
enables  eco-friendly  fabrication  without  using  clean  room  facili-
ties  and  expensive  equipment.  On  the  other  hand,  ITO  requires
post-treatment to realize satisfying resistance/transmittance ratio
and contact with photo-active materials. The post-treatment pro-
cesses  including  plasma-enhanced  CVD  or  high-temperature  an-
nealing ( ca . 400 °C) [27] may damage the sensitive photoactive ma-
terials, which would further increase the fabrication cost and limit
the architectural design of solar cells.

PHJ solar cells comprised of multifunctional nanocarbon elec-
trodes and c-Si have drawn widespread attention, with PCEs ap-
proaching  20%  within  few  years  [28–31] .  The  disruptive  devel-
opment  of  nanocarbon-based  PHJ  solar  cells  is  benefitted  from
the accumulated knowledge of nanocarbon technologies and solar
cell mechanisms. Extensive effort s have been f ocused on chemical
functionalization, device structural design as well as light manage-
ment of the nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cells. This review focuses
on advanced functionalization strategies for improving device per-
formance of nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cells and discusses their
fundamental mechanisms. The chemical functionalization for tun-
ing Fermi level, which is the cornerstone for high device perfor-
mance,  is  discussed  first.  Molecular  adsorption  (gas-phase  dop-
ing), electrochemical gating (liquid-phase doping) and solid-state
functionalization (solid-phase doping) are evaluated based on their
effectiveness  and  stability.  Then  morphological  design  and  hy-
brid  structures  of  graphene  and  CNTs  to  achieve  higher  electri-
cal conductivity and optical transparency are reviewed. The struc-
tural  design  also  focuses  on  the  interface  between  nanocarbon
films  and  photoactive  materials  which  is  critical  to  charge  sep-
aration  and  collection.  In  addition,  photonic  design  is  discussed
including  light  trapping  of  PHJ  solar  cells  and  plasmonic-induce
field  enhancement.  In  the  last  section,  the  recent  progress  in
flexible graphene-based and SWNT-based PHJ solar cells are also
reviewed.

2. Fermi level tuning

Graphene  and  SWNTs  are  sp 2  hybridized  nanocarbon  materi-
als.  In  graphene,  the  wavefunction  overlapping  of  the  conjugate
π bonds  in  the  hexagon  of  carbon  atoms  results  in  the  delo-
calized  π and  π ∗ bands,  i.e.  conduction  band  (CB)  and  valence
band  (VB).  The  cone-shaped  CB  and  VB  intersect  at  the  Dirac
point where the Fermi level crosses, making the electrons mass-
less Dirac fermions ( Fig. 3 a). This unique electronic feature leads
to a high electron mobility ( ∼2 × 10 5 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room tem-
perature  [32] )  in  graphene.  Rolling  graphene  into  SWNTs  gener-
ates curvature-induced quantum confinement. The CB and VB of
SWNTs become discontinuous cutting lines on the cone-shaped CB
and VB of graphene. Each cutting line gives one π –π ∗ band. If the
cutting lines happen to come across the Dirac point, the SWNT is
metallic ( Fig. 3 b); if not, the SWNT is semiconducting ( Fig. 3 c) with
bandgaps up to 2 eV. SWNTs inherit the high electron mobility of
graphene.

The electronic density of states is extremely low near the Fermi
levels  of  both  graphene  and  SWNTs.  The  free  carrier  concentra-
tion is ∼10 20 cm −3 for pristine graphene (or ∼10 12 cm −2 for pla-
nar  distribution),  and  is  ∼10 17  cm −3  for  SWNTs,  both  of  which
are orders of magnitude lower than that of bulk metals. Thus, the
undoped  graphene  and  SWNTs  are  not  suitable  for  applications

parency) of different transparent electrode materials based on: HNO 3 -doped fil-
trated SWNT [17] , NO 2 -doped SWNT film [18] , welded SWNT film with HNO 3 dop-

a Schottky-barrier junction ( i.e. metal-semiconductor junction). The
strongest advantage of a PHJ over a p –n homojunction is the mini-
mized charge carrier recombination loss at the surfaces of Si wafer,
which is embodied by recent record efficiencies of 25.1% [3] and
26.3% [8] for c-Si PHJ solar cells.

Graphene and CNT films offer excellent optoelectronic proper-
ties  for  applications  in  PHJ  solar  cells.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2 ,  us-
ing advanced synthesis method [ 10 , 11 ] and appropriate chemical
functionalization,  SWNT  and  graphene  films  are  very  conductive
especially at transparency (optical transmission at 550 nm wave-
length) higher than 90%, which is difficult  to achieve for metal-
oxide based electrode materials. Moreover, the mechanical flexure
and strong light-matter interaction of nanocarbon materials could
be utilized to fabricate flexible thin-film PHJ solar cells. CNTs and
graphene can have Young’s modulus and tensile strength as high
as  1  TPa  and  80  GPa,  respectively  [12–15] .  On  the  other  hand,
ITO is a ceramic material which can have cracks and fractures at
relatively low strains of 2–3% [16] . Microcracks can propagate, and
lead  to  severe  decreases  in  electrical  conductivity  under  cyclic
tests. Leveraging the excellent optoelectronic and mechanical prop-
erties of graphene and CNTs is promising to  realize flexible and
high-performance PHJ solar cells, expanding their applications to
wearable systems as ubiquitous power source.

Productivity  and  scalability  are  also  distinctive  advantages  of
carbon  nanomaterials  towards  practical  applications  in  PHJ  solar
cells. The mass production of graphene and carbon nanotubes is
predominantly realized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) which
is a gas-phase process capable of scale-up and continuous produc-
tion. The scalability of graphene and CNTs is reflected by the ex-
ponential growth of production in recent decades [21–23] . On the
other hand, metal-oxide based electrode needs to be deposited us-
ing costly and high-vacuum sputtering process in clean-room envi-
ronment. The sputtering deposition process is quite inefficient, and
only less than 30% of the indium in the sputter target could reach
the film, which the remaining ITO is in the pre-fabricated ITO tar-
get, the grinding sludge, and the after-processing residue left on
the walls of the sputtering chamber [24] . Indium recycling is also
an energy-intensive industry which is under development [25] . It
is estimated that the life-cycle energy use of graphene and CNT
films is less than 10% of that of ITO films [26] .

in PHJ solar cells. Doping could effectively shift the Fermi levels
of  graphene  and  SWNTs,  which  increases  charge  carrier  density
in  graphene  and  SWNTs  to  realize  higher  electrical  conductivity.
Moreover,  chemical  functionalization  could  eliminate  the  Schot-
tky barrier between metallic and semiconducting SWNTs, and thus
could  further  improve  the  electrical  conductivity  of  SWNTs.  The
high tunability of Fermi level in graphene [33] and SWNTs [34] can
be demonstrated by continuous band filling through electrochemi-
cal gating. As shown in the waterfall Raman spectra in Fig. 3 d, the
remarkable shift of G and G  ́band positions of graphene was real-
ized at relatively low gate voltages [33] . The similar phenomenon
was also observed in SWNTs [34] . In the sp2 hybridized nanocar-
bon family, graphite and multiwall CNTs (MWNTs) are multi-layer
allotropes  of  graphene  and  SWNTs.  Graphite  and  MWNTs  have
much  higher  inherent  carrier  density  and  hence  are  more  chal-
lenging to be doped, although they have much lower production
cost. This chapter reviews chemical functionalization of graphene
and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through molecular absorption, elec-
trochemical  gating and  solid-state  functionalization. For  practical
applications, the stability and Fermi level tunability are the most
important criteria for evaluating the effect of chemical functional-
ization.

2.1. Molecular adsorption

The high aspect ratio and large surface area of graphene and
SWNTs  are  especially  beneficial  for  molecular  adsorption.  The
charge-transfer process occurs immediately after the direct expo-
sure of a graphene or SWNT film to functionalizing molecules in
solution  or  vapor  phase,  as  schematically  shown  in  Fig.  4 a  and
b. The functionalization process could be either p-type or n-type,
which is respectively induced by electron acceptor or donor. The
doping effectiveness and stability at room temperature are of equal
importance.

HNO
3 -doped
CNT/Si  PHJ  solar  cell  decreased  from  13.8%  to  8.4%  after  24  h
storage  in  the  ambient  [47] .  In  fact,  the  main  drawback  of  the
molecular-adsorption functionalization is the instability in the am-
bient,  which  may  degrade  the  PCEs  of  the  PHJ  solar  cells  up  to
50%  within  days.  The  effectiveness  and  stability  of  four  repre-
sentative p-type doping molecules (HNO
2  and HCl)
were  compared  in  Fig.  5 a,  based  on  their  functionalization  per-
formance in the graphene/Si PHJ solar cells [51] . All the four p-
type  dopants  significantly  increased the  PCEs  of  the  graphene/Si
PHJ  solar  cells  by  more  than  200%.  Among  the  four  molecules,
SOCl
2  was the most effective dopant which improved the PCE of
the  graphene/Si  PHJ  solar  cell  by  230%.  After  8  days  storage  in
2 and HCl showed slightly better doping stabil-
the ambient, SOCl
ity than HNO
2 , which may be resulted from the more
persistent adsorption of Cl atoms serving as the inter-tube linker
[52] .  Fluorine-based  doping  agent  bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-
amide ((CF
2 NH) (TFSA) was also applied to the graphene/Si
PHJ  solar  cell,  which  improved  the  PCE  from  1.9%  to  8.6%.  Af-
ter  3  days  storage  in  the  ambient,  the  PCE  only  degraded  by
10%  [53] .  Therefore,  halogen-containing  molecules  are  regarded
as  promising  p-type  dopants  for  graphene-based  and  SWNT-
based  PHJ  solar  cells  because  of  their  high  doping  efficacy  and
stability.

ported a doping method which combined chlorosulfonic acid and
gold chloride (AuCl
3 ), both of which were strong p-type dopants
to SWNTs [55] . A PCE of 11% was achieved after doping for the
SWNT/Si PHJ  solar  cell  in  the  dry  state.  By  measuring  J –V  char-
acteristics  under  different  operating  temperatures,  the  activation
energy  (built-in  potential)  of  the  SWNT/Si  PHJ  solar  cell  was
extracted  as  1.56  eV  using  the  Schottky–Mott  standard  model.
This  value  was  higher  than  those  of  the  conventional  metal-
semiconductor (M-S) and metal-insulator-semiconductor Schottky
solar cells. The heavily p-doped SWNT film could induce a p-type
inversion layer onto the surface of the n-type Si, resulting in an
equivalent p–n junction at room temperature. This ambient doping
method could save fabrication cost up to 35%, compared with the
conventional  high-temperature diffusion  processes  for  generating
p–n junctions [56–58] . The stability of the p-type doping could be
further improved by sealing solar cells with polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) [59] .

Unlike p-type doping, n-type doping of graphene and SWNTs
is  difficult  to  be  realized  in  the  ambient,  because  the  oxygen
adsorption  in  the  ambient  could  p-dope  graphene  and  SWNTs,
thereby  neutralizing  the  n-type  doping  effect.  Typical  electron-
donors  such  as  alkali  metals  [60–62]  could  achieve  n-type  dop-
ing  of  graphene  and  SWNTs.  However,  alkali  metals  such  as  K
and  Rb  are  unstable  in  the  ambient  and  thus  not  suitable  for
practical applications in solar cells. Li et al.  [63] realized n-type
doping  of  the  SWNT/p-Si PHJ  solar  cells  using  metallocene  [64–
66] . After evacuating in high vacuum for 48 h, the electron-rich
metallocene  – Cp
2 Ni,  as  well  as  the  closely  related
2 Cr) were spin coated onto
complex bis(benzene)chromium ((C
the  SWNT/p-Si  PHJ  solar  cells  at  room  temperature.  The  molec-
ular structures of the three organometallic compounds are given
in Fig. 5 b. Compared with the chemically stable ferrocene (18 va-
2 Ni have 19 and 20 valence elec-
lence electrons), Cp
trons  respectively,  and  thus  are  ready  to  donate  the  extra  elec-
trons. The PCE of the Cp
2 Co-doped SWNT/p-Si PHJ solar cell was
3.82%, which was 450 times higher than previously reported pris-
tine  SWNT/p-Si  PHJ  solar  cells  [67] .  The  molecular  orbital  en-
2 Ni  were  calculated  by  den-
ergies  of  Cp
sity functional theory (DFT) simulation to investigate the doping
mechanism. Fig. 5 c shows the highest occupied molecular orbitals
(HOMO) levels of the three organometallic compounds, using hy-
drazine  [68]  as  a  reference.  Cp
2 Co  was  found  to  have  the  high-
est HOMO level and the highest tendency to donate electrons to
SWNTs. The J –V characteristics of the n-SWNT/p-Si PHJ solar cells
in Fig. 5 d demonstrate that the dopant HOMO level is positively
correlated to the sheet resistance reduction of the SWNT film as
well as the performance improvement of the n-SWNT/p-Si PHJ so-

were more stable than the hydrazine-doped ones [63] , as shown
in  Fig.  5 e.  Nitrogen-containing  molecules,  such  as  tetracyano-p-
quinodimethane  (TCNQ)  [ 69 , 70 ],  triphenylmethane  carbinol  base
(TPM-CB) [71] and polyethyleneimine (PEI) [ 10 , 72 ], have been re-
ported as effective n-type dopants for graphene and SWNTs. How-
ever,  these  molecules  have  not  been  applied  to  graphene-based
and SWNT-based PHJ solar cells yet.

2.2. Electrochemical gating

In addition to molecular adsorption, electrochemical gating is
another effective functionalization method which could accurately
tune the Fermi levels of graphene and SWNTs. The electrochemical
gating is typically realized by applying a gate voltage to graphene
or SWNTs through conductive solution. The ions in the conductive

solution could accumulate on the surface of the graphene or SWNT
film, donating or extracting electrons according to the applied volt-
age type. The electrochemical doping of graphene is consecutive,
while that of SWNTs is stepwise when the Fermi level reaches the
edges of one dimensional subbands (E

ii ).

The electrochemical gating makes it possible to investigate the
effects of Fermi-level offset on the built-in potential and PCE of
the nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cells. As schematically shown in
Fig. 6 a, ionic liquid was added on the top surface of the SWNT/Si
PHJ solar cell to realize the electrochemical gating [73,74] . The PCE
of  the  electrochemical  gated  SWNT/Si  PHJ  solar  cell  was  tuned
reversibly from 4% to 11%. The applied gate voltage changed the
built-in  potential  and  the  SWNT  film  resistance,  which  resulted
in  the  modulation  of  V oc  and  FF  of  the  SWNT/Si  PHJ  solar  cell.
The negative field could also reduce the SWNT/Si interface dipole,
which unpinned the Fermi level of SWNTs. Moreover, the increased
charge carrier density in the SWNT film could increase the depth
of the depletion layer in the n-type silicon. Fig. 6 b shows the elec-
trochemical gating of the SWNT/Si nanowire (SiNW) PHJ solar cell
[75] . As SiNW arrays have much larger surface area than the bulk
Si, the electrochemical gating exhibited remarkable tunability on

the J –V characteristics of the SWNT/SiNW PHJ solar cells. The V oc
could be reversibly altered from 0.15 V to 0.58 V, which demon-
strated the effectiveness of the ionic liquid-based electrochemical
gating in the three-dimensional PHJ solar cells.

Graphene/Al
tical  loss  in  the  graphene/n-GaAs  PHJ  solar  cell  due  to  its  high
transparency, as shown in Fig. 6 c. The applied negative gate volt-
age shifted the Fermi level of graphene downwards, which resulted
in a higher V oc of the graphene/n-GaAs PHJ solar cell. The highest
V oc  was 0.96 V at the gate voltage of −15 V, while the V oc  was
0.7 V at zero gate voltage. At the gate voltage of −15 V, the PCE of
the graphene/n-GaAs PHJ solar cell reached 18.5%, which was the
highest PCE value reported so far of its kind. However, this record-
high PCE may need recalculation based on energy balance, as the
applied  field-effect  gate  voltage  would  cause  extra  energy  con-
sumption. A similar control technology of gate field was applied
to the graphene/p-InP PHJ solar cells [77] , in which a positive gate
voltage  was  used  to  shift  the  Fermi  level  of  graphene  upwards.
It was found that with the increase of the applied positive gate

creased until reaching saturation at the gate voltage of + 16 V.

The electrochemical gated nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cell be-
longs to the emerging screen field-effect photovoltaics [78–80] . It
is an improved version of the Schottky-barrier solar cell by stabi-
lizing surface state and creating p–n junction inside the MIS so-
lar  cell.  Compared  with  bulk  metals,  graphene  and  SWNT  films
could produce deeper inversion layers in the pairing semiconduc-
tors through electrochemical gating, resulting in better device per-
formance.

2.3. Solid-state functionalization

Compared with molecular adsorption and electrochemical gat-
ing,  solid-state  functionalization  is  a  more  practical  method  for
solar  cells,  because  of  its  higher  stability  in  the  ambient.  Low-
work function metal oxides could be thermally evaporated onto a
graphene or SWNT film, followed by annealing at an elevated tem-
perature (140 °C ∼ 400 °C) [81–84] . The annealing process could
create non-stoichiometric state and induce oxygen vacancies in the
metal oxides. The electron traps caused by the oxygen deficiency
would extract the electrons form graphene or SWNTs and shift the
Fermi  level  downwards  [ 85 , 86 ].  Wang  et  al  thermally  deposited
molybdenum oxides (MoO x ) onto the SWNT/Si PHJ solar cells [31] .
The MoO x layer was considered to have two main functions: as a
p-dopant of SWNTs which improved the V oc from 0.57 to 0.59 eV
and the FF from 69% to 78%; and as an antireflection layer which
improved the Jsc from 27.9 to 36.5 mA/cm 2 . However, the thermal
annealing effect on the performance of the SWNT/Si PHJ solar cells
is unclear.

Because  the  solid-state  dopants  could  not  penetrate  through
layers  of  graphene  or  SWNT  film,  the  solid-state  functionaliza-
tion usually could not achieve very high doping strength. Design-
ing solution-based dopant precursors may be a cost-effective and
scalable approach to solve this issue. Fig. 7 a shows a penetrative
and  conformal  solid-state  functionalization  method  based  on  re-
2 and SWNTs [28] . After spin-coating
dox reaction of CuCl
of CuCl
2 redox, the sheet resistance of the SWNT film de-
creased from 306.9 to 69.4 Ω /sq. immediately and did not show
noticeable increase after year-long storage in the ambient. The PCE
of the SWNT/Si PHJ solar cell was improved from 6.6% to 14.1% af-
2  redox functionalization. In addition to the
ter the CuCl
p-type doping effect, the CuCl
2  redox was also found to
unpin the Fermi level of SWNTs and enhance the charge carrier
tunneling, which significantly improved the V oc and FF.

The charge transfer induced by electron trap could also be re-
alized by deposition of fluorographene [87–89] and graphene ox-
ide quantum dots [ 90 , 91 ]. In general, fluorographene and graphene
oxide have relatively mild p-type doping effects on graphene and
SWNTs. However, because of the homogeneous π –π stacking inter-
actions, their applications in the nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cells
are very effective and stable. By drop-casting the graphene oxide
(GO) solution on top of the graphene/Si PHJ solar cells, the PCE
was increased from 3.6% to 10.6% with good stability in the am-
bient [92] . The GO layer served as an effective p-type conductor
when inserted in between graphene and Si, resulting in a deeper
inversion layer [ 93 , 94 ]. In addition, GO could serve as surfactant
to uniformly disperse SWNTs, thereby realizing conformal doping
of SWNTs [95–97] . The optimal GO/SWNT ratio was found to be
1:2.25, which was the highest SWNT concentration without precip-
itations after 16 h settlement [98] . The PCE of 6.5% was achieved

for the GO-dispersed SWNT/Si PHJ solar cell, which was slightly
higher  than  that  of  the  pristine  SWNT/Si  PHJ  solar  cell  (5.9%).
Fluorinated  graphene  (FG)  which  contains  high  density  halogen
molecules can also realize p-type solid-state doping of graphene
and SWNTs. Zhong et al. [99] prepared FG by immersing pristine
graphene in SF
6  plasma at 10 mTorr with a power of 50 W and
a gas feed rate of 100 sccm for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 7 b, af-
ter inserting FG in between graphene and Si, both the V oc and FF
increased significantly, and the PCE boosted from 3.17% to 7.52%.
Moreover, the minority carrier lifetime was increased after the in-
sertion  of  FG,  which  was  because  a  strong  inversion  layer  was
formed near the Si surface.

Photon-induced  doping  is  drawing  increasing  attention  in  re-
cent years. Constant photon exposure could cause electronic tran-
sition in graphene and SWNTs [100–102] , which could be utilized
to enhance the device performance of the nanocarbon-based PHJ
solar cells. Wang et al. [103] observed that solar irradiation could
induce  p-type  doping  of  graphene  in  the  graphene/Si  PHJ  solar
cells. After 70-min exposure to solar irradiation, a mild red-shift
of the G’ band in the Raman spectroscopy and a noticeable drop
in  the  series  resistance  of  the  graphene/Si  PHJ  solar  cells  were
observed.  Semiconductor  quantum  dots,  such  as  CdSe  [104] ,  InP
and ZnO quantum dots [105] could also effectively cause photo-
induced charge transfer from graphene or SWNTs. Li et al. [104] re-
ported photo-induced p-type doping of graphene by CdSe quantum
dots in the graphene/h-BN/GaAs PHJ solar cells. The Schottky bar-
rier height of the p-doped graphene/h-BN/GaAs PHJ solar cell was
1.02 eV, while that of the un-doped device was 0.88 eVs.

The  photo-induced  n-type  doping  of  graphene  and  SWNTs  is
more  challenging  to  be  achieved,  considering  their  sensitivity  to
the ambient environment. Ho et al. [106] observed light-induced
n-type doping of graphene, in which the inherent oxygen deficien-
cies of a non-stoichiometric amorphous TiO x thin film acted as ef-
fective hole-trapping centers in gap states. The holes in the pho-
toexcited electron–hole pairs could be trapped in gap states, while
electrons in the conduction band (CB) of the TiO x  film could be

transferred to graphene according to the band alignment [106] . As
shown in Fig. 7 c, 5 -min sunlight illumination on the graphene/TiO x
layer slowly shifted the Fermi level of graphene upwards and in-
creased the PCE of the graphene/p-Si PHJ solar cell from 2.2% to
8.2% [107] . The absorption of the near-UV light by the TiO x  layer
generated  photo-excited  electrons  which  were  subsequently  in-
jected to graphene, resulting in n-type doping and the increased
built-in potential in the graphene/p-Si PHJ solar cells.

3. Electrical property tuning

3.1. Morphological design and hybrid structure

As SWNTs are one-dimensional materials, the intra-tube elec-
tron transport along the SWNT longitudinal axis is much more effi-
cient than that across the inter-nanotube junction. The anisotropic
characteristic  could  be  utilized  through  morphological  design  to
decouple  the  optical  transparency  and  electrical  conductivity  of
SWNT  films.  For  example,  the  horizontally  aligned  SWNTs  could
maintain  the  superior  one-dimensional  transport  to  the  largest
extent.  Generally,  the  fabrication  methods  of  the  horizontally
aligned  SWNTs  can  be  categorized  into  dry  and  wet  processes.
Fig.  8 a  shows  a  typical  dry  process,  in  which  the  horizontally
aligned MWNT film was realized by drawing the vertically aligned
MWNT  arrays  [108] .  The  film  was  then  transferred  onto  a  pat-
terned n-Si substrate followed by ethanol vapor treatment for film
densification [109] . Compared with the randomly oriented MWNT
film, the horizontally aligned MWNT film showed better contact
quality with the silicon substrate. As a result, the PCE of the hori-
zontally aligned MWNT/Si PHJ solar cell was 8.4%, which was much
higher than that of the randomly oriented MWNT/Si PHJ solar cell
(2.6%) [109] . On the other hand, in a typical wet process shown
in Fig. 8 b, SWNTs were first dispersed using surfactant or chloro-
sulfonic acid, and then were drop-casted on a polished glass sub-
strate. By compressing a polished substrate on top and manually
sliding  the  two  glass  sheets  in  opposite  directions,  the  horizon-

tally  aligned  SWNT  film  was  obtained  by  the  shear  stress.  This
method was also named as ‘sliding coating method’ [ 54 , 110 , 111 ].
This  preparation  method  could  suppress  the  roughness  of  the
SWNT film and increase the contact area between SWNTs and the
silicon substrate. Thus, the effective area for photo-energy conver-
sion was increased, and the excited electron-hole carries in the Si
substrate could be separated locally at the SWNT/Si interface. Both
the dry and wet aligning processes could be carried out at room
temperature, and thus are suitable for a variety of solar cells and
optoelectronic devices. The dry process is more cost-effective and
can produce better alignment than the wet process, but it is only
applicable to MWNTs which have more atomic defects and lower
electrical conductivity than SWNTs. Recently, the thermophoresis-
based  dry  process  was  realized  to  enable  the  tailoring  of  angle
distribution of SWNTs during deposition [ 112 , 113 ], which may be
promising to design smarter SWNT structures for PHJ solar cells.

Another method to overcome the trade-off between the electri-
cal conductivity and optical transparency of the nanocarbon-based
electrodes  is  to  create  a  three-dimensional  hierarchical  architec-
ture  of  graphene  or  SWNTs  with  strategically  placed  dense  and
sparse portions. Cui et al. [114] proposed a self-assembled hierar-
chical micro-honeycomb network of SWNTs, which was achieved
by  a  ‘water  vapor  treatment’  method.  As  shown  in  Fig.  8 c,  the
micro-honeycomb  network  was  composed  of  dense  walls  and  a
buckypaper bottom, which could simultaneously increase the op-
tical transmittance and decrease the sheet resistance. The densely

cross-linked SWNT walls in the micro-honeycomb structure acted
as efficient conduction pathways to collect the charge carriers gen-
erated from the adjacent micro-honeycomb cells. The configuration
significantly shortened the carrier diffusion path, resulting in the
decreased device series resistance and increased FF value. Another
hierarchical SWNT film which was composed of sub-10-μm micro-
grids and random network was formed by a patterned flow de-
position of SWNTs [115] . Through optimizing the thickness, width
and periodicity of the SWNT grids, the sheet resistance of the hi-
erarchical SWNT film was reduced to 53 (cid:3)/sq. at 80% transmit-
tance,  which  was  46%  lower  than  that  of  the  random  network.
Shi et al[116] applied an improved concept to the PHJ solar cells
with the densified CNT grids. Fig. 8 d illustrates a hierarchical CNT
structure composed of many capillary-densified CNT strips on top
of  a  highly  transparent  CNT  thin  film  [116] .  The  densified  CNT
strips were formed by drawing CNT films out of ethanol with a
tweezer. The CNT strips only covered a small portion of the solar
cell surface, with most of the active area remaining transparent. A
PCE value as high as 10% was achieved for a large-area ( > 2 cm 2 )
CNT/Si PHJ solar cell for the first time.

Moreover, many hybrid structures were developed to increase
the electrical conductivity of the nanocarbon-based electrodes. A
hierarchical  CNT-embroidered  graphene  film  formed  by  directly
transferring a CNT film onto a smooth graphene film was reported
by Shi et al. [117] . The bi-continuous structure consists of an inter-
connected CNT spider-web uniformly embedded in the graphene

film,  resulting  in  co-existence  of  CNT/Si  and  graphene/Si  junc-
tions  ( Fig.  8 e).  By  anti-reflection  coating  and  nitric  acid  doping,
a  PCE  of  15.2%  was  achieved.  The  synergy  between  the  highly
conductive  CNTs  and  the  ultra-smooth  graphene  contributed  to
the improved device performance. Fig. 8 f shows the hybrid struc-
ture  of  the  SWNT  film  and  the  Ag  nanowires  (AgNWs).  After
the hybridization, the electrical conductivity was significantly in-
creased  with  a  slight  decrease  of  the  optical  transparency  [118] .
A  PCE  of  greater  than  10%  was  achieved  for  a  49  mm 2 -sized
AgNW-SWNT/Si  PHJ  solar  cell.  Monolayer  graphene  films  usu-
ally  suffered  from  minor  cracks  on  copper  growth  substrates,
which significantly degraded electrical conductivity [119] . The mi-
4  on top of graphene
nor cracks could be filled by coating HAuCl
( Fig.  8 g)  [120] .  The  Au  filling  effectively  reduced  the  sheet
resistance of the graphene film, resulting in a PCE of 12.3%. Wad-
hwa  et  al  reported  that  the  combination  of  the  SWNT  wide-
spaced grid and ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bistri-
fluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI-BTI)) enabled more light to reach
the SWNT/Si interface and created a deeper inversion layer near
the  interface. [73]  Other  conductive  organic  materials  such  as
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) [ 121 , 122 ], 2,2 (cid:3) ,7,7 (cid:3) -tetrakis( N , N (cid:3) -di-
p -methoxyphenylamine)-9,9 (cid:3) -spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) [123,
124] and polyvinyl alcohol(PVA)-based solid electrolyte [125] were
also  used  to  realize  high-performance  hybrid  structures  for  the
graphene-based and SWNT-based PHJ solar cells.

3.2. Junction interface engineering

Unlike  the  traditional  semiconductor  p–n  junction  solar  cells,
the nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cells are formed by simple transfer
processes of graphene or SWNT films on photoactive materials at
room temperature. This not only saves a significant amount of total
energy consumption in solar cell manufacturing, but also enables
in-depth investigation of interface mechanisms and exploration of
innovative PHJ solar cells. The dielectric layer between nanocarbon
and photoactive layers is of vital importance for alleviating Fermi
level pinning and carrier recombination in PHJ solar cells.

The interfacial oxide layer in a typical Si-based PHJ solar cell
was  composed  of  a  SiO
2  layer  sandwiched  by  two  layers  of
sub-nanometer-thick  nonstoichiometric  SiO x .  Oxidizing  agents
could penetrate through grain boundaries of graphene and inter-
tube space of SWNTs to modify the thickness of the native oxide
layer on Si in the nanocarbon/Si PHJ solar cells. Interestingly, previ-
ous studies on interfacial native oxide layer showed contradictory
results. Jia et al. [127] found that the PCE of the CNT/Si PHJ so-
lar cell increased significantly with the growth of the native oxide
layer at the interface between the CNT film and Si substrate, from
0.5% without interfacial oxide to 8.8% with an optimal oxide thick-
ness of ca . 1 nm. As shown in Fig. 9 a, the J –V characteristics of
the CNT/Si PHJ solar cell were highly reversible with the growth
3 ) and removal (treated by hydrofluo-
(treated by nitric acid, HNO
ric acid, HF) of the silicon oxide layer. The presence of the optimal
oxide layer ( ca . 1 nm-thick) could suppress the reverse saturation
current and lead to a mixture of thermionic and tunneling carrier
transport [127] . On the other hand, Jung et al. [54] observed that
the PCE of the p-SWNT/n-Si PHJ solar cell was increased after the
removal of the silicon oxide layer by HF treatment, and the ideal-
ity factor of the device was approaching unity. It was also reported
that the removal of the interfacial oxide by HF treatment could sig-
nificantly improve the performance of the n-SWNT/p-Si PHJ solar
cells  [35] .  The  above-discussed  contradictory  results  require  fur-
ther study to solidify the role of the interfacial oxide layers in the
nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cells.

Angle-resolved X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (AR-XPS) was
used to quantitatively investigate the effect of the interfacial oxide.
The interfacial states demonstrated by the AR-XPS spectra could be

directly linked to the J –V characteristics of the nanocarbon/Si PHJ
solar cells [128] . Based on the AR-XPS characterization, the optimal
thickness of the interfacial oxide layer was 0.7 nm for the PHJ so-
lar cells with pristine graphene or SWNT films [ 30 , 50 ]. As shown
in Fig. 9 b, a thicker oxide layer between the SWNT film and the
Si substrate resulted in the hysteresis between the forward and re-
verse scans of the SWNT/Si PHJ solar cell, owing to the charging
and discharging of the dielectric layer [50] . Doping could enhance
tunneling of charge carriers and suppress recombination of elec-
trons and holes, which increased the optimal thickness of the in-
terfacial oxide layer to 1.5 nm [30] , as shown in Fig. 9 c. This sug-
gests that a heavier doping combined with a thicker interfacial ox-
ide layer could lead to higher device performance of the nanocar-
bon/Si PHJ solar cells. It was also reported that RCA treatment was
a powerful tool to achieve thicker interfacial oxide layers in the
SWNT/Si PHJ solar cells [50] . As shown in Fig. 9 d, after the p-type
doping process using CuCl
2 , the PCE of the SWNT/Si PHJ
solar cell treated by RCA for 3 min was significantly improved by
148% [28] . The increased interfacial oxide layer in the SWNT/Si PHJ
solar cell could eliminate the surface states and unpin the Fermi
level, boosting the p-type doping effect of CuCl

In addition, the emerging two-dimensional materials, such as
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) [129–131] and molybdenum disul-
fide  (MoS
2 )  [132–134] ,  could  be  utilized  as  interfacial  layers  to
enhance the performance of PHJ solar cells. As shown in Fig. 10 a,
the graphene/h-BN/Si PHJ solar cell was fabricated by transfer de-
position of h-BN in between graphene and Si [135] . The PCE value
of the graphene/h-BN/Si PHJ solar cell was 20% higher than that of
the graphene/Si PHJ solar cell. Considering the metallic behavior
of  graphene,  h-BN  served  as  an  effective  electron-blocking/hole-
transporting layer, which suppressed the interface recombination.
The thickness of the h-BN layer could be tuned with atomic preci-
sion. The main advantage of the h-BN layer over the native oxide
layer was that h-BN had a similar lattice constant with graphene
and  an  atomically  smooth  surface  without  dangling  bonds  nor
charge  carrier  traps  [136–138] ,  which  guaranteed  better  contact
quality with graphene. It was also reported that the insertion of
2  could  improve  the  performance  of  the  graphene/n-Si  PHJ
MoS
solar  cells  [ 139 , 140 ],  although  the  role  of  MoS
2  needed  further
in-depth studies. Moreover, MoS
2  could be directly used as pho-
toactive  material  and  stacked  with  graphene  or  SWNTs  to  form
nanocarbon/MoS
2  PHJ solar cells. These PHJ solar cells exhibiting
strong  photo-responsive  behaviors  and  having  PCEs  of  up  to  1%
[141–144] are comparable to the best existing ultrathin solar cells
[145–147] . The vertical van der Waal stacked layer structure offers
a new direction for ultralight, ultrathin and high-efficient portable
solar cells.

trates the schematic and J –V curves of the graphene/WO
solar cell [ 148 , 149 ]. The WO
3 thin film with the optimal thickness
of 15 nm was facilely deposited on top of the Si substrate using
thermal evaporation. A PCE of 10.59% was achieved for the opti-
mized  graphene/WO
3 /Si  PHJ  solar  cell,  compared  with  3.99%  for
the graphene/Si PHJ solar cell. The band structure ( Fig. 10 b) illus-

trated  the  large  offset  between  the  Fermi-levels  of  WO
which resulted in upward band bending at the WO

and enhanced built-in potential. The WO

as  an  electron-blocking  layer  for  selective  hole  transport  toward
graphene.

based  electrode  and  the  photoactive  semiconductor  is  not  only
an  effective  way  to  improve  the  PHJ  solar  cell  performance,  but
also a platform to investigate fundamental semiconductor physics
such as Fermi level pinning [150] . Moreover, the interfaces with

multi-functions  reviewed  here  are  also  promising  to  be  applied
in the organic solar cells [151] , organic-inorganic perovskite solar
cells [152] , and other optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting
diodes [153] and photodetectors [154] .

4. Optical property tuning

4.1. Antireflection coating

For PHJ solar cells, the light reflection from the polished sur-
face of the crystalline Si or GaAs could be more than 30% [155] ,
which caused substantial energy loss in the light absorption. An-
tireflection structures such as honeycomb texture [155] , pyramid
texture  [ 156 , 157 ],  black  silicon  [158–160]  as  well  as  vertical  ar-
rays  of  semiconducting  nanowires  [161]  could  reduce  light  re-
flection  effectively.  However,  these  antireflection  structures  are
usually  fabricated  by  photolithography  and  reactive  ion  etching
of  the  crystalline  semiconductor  surfaces.  The  degraded  contact
between  the  top  nanocarbon  electrode  and  the  structured  pho-
toactive  materials  is  another  potential  issue  owing  to  the  in-
creased  surface  roughness.  Alternatively,  the  antireflection  coat-
ing  (ARC)  can  be  deposited  through  a  scalable  method  which
is  promising  for  the  graphene-based  and  SWNT-based  PHJ  solar
cells.

TiO

2  with a refractive index of 2.2 could generate destructive
2 junction, which would trap the incident
interference at the air-TiO
light in a certain wavelength range. The condition for the full de-

structive interference is given as d = λ / (4 • n), where d is the thick-
ness of the ARC, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, and n is
the refractive index of the ARC. The schematic of the antireflection
effect of the TiO
2  layer caused by the destructive interference is
shown  in  Fig.  11 a  [162] .  It  is  preferable  to  have  low  reflectance
in the wavelength range of 40 0–80 0 nm (major solar irradiance).
Both full and partial destructive interferences can decrease the re-
flectance. It was reported that a 70-nm-thick coating layer of the
colloidal TiO
2 nanoparticles decreased the light reflectance of the
CNT/Si PHJ solar cell from ca . 40% to less than 5% at the wave-
length of 600 nm ( Fig. 11 b), resulting in the significant increase
of J sc  [ 30 , 162 , 163 ]. Molybdenum oxide (MoO x ) was also an effec-
tive ARC material which could reduce the light reflectance from ca .
35% to ca . 20% [164] . In the wavelength range of 40 0–120 0 nm, the
light reflectance of the MoO x -SWNT/Si PHJ solar cell ( Fig. 11 c) did
not show an interference pattern, owing to the non-stoichiometric
composition of MoO x with a relatively broad refractive index.

Polymer  materials,  such  as  polymethylmethacrylate  (PMMA)
[165]  and  poly  (3,  4-ethylene  dioxythiophene):poly  (styrenesul-
fonate) (PEDOT:PSS) [ 166 , 167 ], could also be applied as ARC ma-
terials through spin-coating to increase PCEs of the nanocarbon-
based PHJ solar cells, as shown in Fig. 11 d and 10 e. Their thick-
nesses could be modulated by changing the concentration of the
solutions.  In  addition,  PMMA  could  block  the  ambient  environ-
ment  and  extend  the  doping  effect  of  nitric  acid  on  the  CNT/Si
PHJ  solar  cells  [165] ;  while  PEDOT:PSS  could  reduce  the  series

loidal  CuCl
2  redox,  which  served  as  both  ARC  and  p-
type dopant to SWNT films, was a multifunctional coating mate-
rial  for  the  SWNT/Si  PHJ  solar  cells  [28] .  A  50%  decrease  of  the
light  reflection  of  the  SWNT/Si  PHJ  solar  cell  as  well  as  a  five-
fold sheet resistance decrease of the SWNT film were realized by
using a 30-nm-thick CuCl
2 redox coating layer, as shown
in Fig. 11 f.

4.2. Plasmonic-enhanced absorption

Localized surface plasmon resonance is the excited electron os-
cillation when light at the plasmon resonance frequency scatters at
the surface of the metal nanoparticles (NPs). The scattering cross-
section of metal NPs can be orders of magnitude larger than the
physical cross-section, owing to the strong light-matter interaction
[168] . Therefore, plasmon-induced light trapping has been widely
used to enhance the light absorption in inorganic thin-film solar
cells  [169–173] ,  organic  solar  cells  [174–176]  and  organometallic
perovskite solar cells [177–180] . Furthermore, the plasmon-induced
electron-hole pairs could be harvested by a charge separation pro-
cess, which further contributes to the photocurrent enhancement
[174] .

The plasmonic effect could effectively improve the performance
of  the  graphene-based  and  SWNT-based  PHJ  solar  cells.  For  the
SWNT  photodetectors  [181]  and SWNT/Si PHJ  solar cells [182] ,
large-diameter SWNTs have better coupling with the localized sur-
face plasmon of NPs than small-diameter SWNTs. As shown in Fig.
12 a, the cubic-shaped Pt NPs with the average diameter of 7 nm

were  spin-coated  on  top  of  the  graphene/Si PHJ  solar  cell.  After
the  deposition  of  Pt  NPs,  the  PCE  of  the  graphene/Si  PHJ  solar
cell was increased from 4.92% to 7.04%, accompanied with the in-
creased J sc , V oc and FF [183] . The cubic-shaped Pt NPs could scatter
a broader wavelength range of sunlight than the sphere Pt NPs, re-
sulting in enhanced solar absorption and shorter penetration depth
of the sunlight, hence greater J sc values. The cubic-shaped Pt NPs
with high work function p-doped graphene and shifted its Fermi
level upwards, resulting in the increased V oc . Moreover, the PCE of
the graphene/Si PHJ solar cell with cubic-shaped Pt NPs increased
under  continuous  sunlight  illumination  [183] ,  which  may  be  at-
tributed to that the hole injection from the Si substrate neutralized
the plasmon-induced hot electron injection from noble metal NPs
[ 184 , 185 ].  As  shown  in  Fig.  12 b,  after  coating  80-nm-diameter
sphere-shaped Au NPs on graphene, the PCE of the graphene/GaAs
PHJ solar cell increased from 8.83% to 11.8% [29] . The J sc was also
increased  significantly  after  Au  NPs  coating,  but  the  V oc  and  FF
were remained almost the same. With the Au NPs surface plasmon,
the solar absorption mainly occurred near the graphene/GaAs het-
erojunction ( Fig. 12 c) where the separation and collection of charge
carriers were more efficient, resulting in the increased J sc [29] .

To  investigate  the  effect  of  the  Au  NPs  on  the  light  absorp-
tion  in  the  Si  substrate,  Luo  et  al.  [186]  used  finite  elemental
method  (FEM)  to  simulate  the  relative  electric  field  distribution
(|E| 2  =  |E
0 | 2 )  at  the  heterojunctions  with  and  without  Au  NPs,
as  shown  in  Fig.  12 d.  A  hot  spot  with  high  electric  field  inten-
sity  was  found  beneath  each  Au  NP,  owing  to  the  surface  plas-
mon resonance. Under the optimal conditions (the lattice constant
was 300 nm, and the Au NP diameter was 80 nm), the light ab-

14

K. Cui, S. Maruyama / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 70 (2019) 1–21

sorption in the Si substrate was enhanced by 5.5% at the wave-
length  of  600  nm.  The  enhancement  could  effectively  improve
the  PCE  by  limiting  the  charge  separation  near  the  graphene/Si
heterojunction.

It is worth mentioning that graphene [187] and SWNTs [188–
190]  have  inherent  plasmon  resonance  absorption.  Nevertheless,
their  inherent  plasmon  effect  has  not  been  utilized  in  PHJ  so-
lar cells so far, as the plasmonic peak positions of graphene and
SWNTs locate in the terahertz-to-far infrared and ultra-UV ranges.
Through  tuning  of  Fermi  level  and  modification  of  geometrical
size, the plasmonic peak positions of graphene and SWNTs can be
shifted to near infrared [189–194] , making it applicable to enhance
the performance of the PHJ solar cells.

5. Towards flexible PHJ solar cells

Flexible PHJ solar cells can provide portable power for ubiqui-
tous electronic sensors and devices. The electrodes and the pho-
toactive materials of the flexible PHJ solar cells are required to pos-
sess excellent mechanical flexibility and robustness. The superior
mechanical property  and  electrical  conductivity  of  graphene and
SWNTs  make  them  the  perfect  candidates  as  the  electrode  ma-
terials of the flexible PHJ solar cells. Through chemical function-
alization as well as smart morphological, electronic and photonic
designs, the performance of the graphene-based and SWNT-based
flexible  PHJ  solar  cells  is  superior  over  that  of  the  conventional
ITO-based ones [195] .

Using  c-Si  thin  films  is  an  effective  way  to  cut  material  cost
and limit total PV module cost to below US$0.50–0.75/W, which
is  critical  for  utility-scale  adoption  [ 1–3 , 196 , 197 ].  More  impor-
tantly,  the  c-Si  film  with  a  thickness  less  than  50  μm  indicates
good  flexural  rigidity,  and  its  flexibility  increases  with  the  de-
crease  of  the  film  thickness  [198] .  However,  decreasing  the  c-Si
film thickness to below 50 μm would cause insufficient light ab-
sorption  and  degraded  PCEs.  The  trade-off between  the  flexibil-
ity and the light absorption is major technological difficulty lim-
iting  the  advancement  of  the  flexible  graphene/Si  and  SWNT/Si
PHJ  solar  cells.  Ruan  et  al.  fabricated  flexible  graphene/Si  PHJ
solar  cells  using  thin  c-Si  films  with  different  thicknesses  (10,
20  and  40  μm)  for  the  first  time  [199] .  The  used  processes
included  passivation  of  the  Si  surface,  poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(P3HT)  coating  and  optimization  of  the  graphene  thickness.  The
optimal PCEs of the graphene/10-μm-thick Si and graphene/40-μm-
thick Si flexible PHJ solar cells were 2.92% and 8.42%, respectively.
Fig. 13 a shows that the PCE of the graphene/10-μm-thick Si PHJ
solar cell degraded by only 7% after 60 bending cycles at a fixed
bending radius of 8 mm [200] . Fig. 13 b shows the recently devel-
oped kerf-less mechanical exfoliation technique to obtain ultrathin
c-Si foils on the “parent” Si wafer [201] . A Nickel film with a thick-
ness of 50–55 μm was electroplated onto the back surface of the
c-Si substrate. Alternate thermal annealing and controlled spalling
processes induced thermal stress at the metal/Si interface and ini-
tiated a crack at the wafer edge for the exfoliation of ultrathin c-Si
film. The thickness of the exfoliated ultrathin c-Si film could be
tuned by controlling the temperature of the thermal cycling pro-
cess. A PCE of 7.4% was obtained for the flexible graphene/8-μm-
thick Si PHJ solar cell. The 8-μm-thick Si film was the thinnest Si
substrate ever used for the fabrication of the flexible graphene/Si
PHJ solar cells.

Despite the impressive mechanical robustness, the PCEs of the
flexible graphene/Si PHJ solar cells were relatively low due to the
insufficient solar absorption of graphene and Si. The better photon
absorption of SWNTs could be the key to improve the performance
of the flexible Si-based PHJ solar cells. Li et al. [202] realized the
flexible SWNT/Si PHJ solar cell by mounting the flexible n-type Si
wafer  (with  a  SWNT  cathode  on  top)  onto  a  thin  PET  sheet,  as

shown in Fig. 13 c. The PCEs of the flexible SWNT/12-μm-thick Si
and SWNT/50-μm-thick Si PHJ solar cells without any additional
light-trapping  structures  were  3.48%  and  7.37%,  respectively.  The
photocarrier generation in the SWNTs as well as the photocarrier
injection from the SWNTs into the flexible Si film were clarified
by the femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy method. The
strong light-matter interaction was induced by the quantum con-
finement of the SWNTs. Applying SWNTs to generate photocurrent
was promising to tackle the insufficient light absorption of the ul-
trathin, flexible Si substrate.

In addition to the flexible c-Si substrates, graphene and SWNT
films  can  be  transferred  on  various  flexible  polymer  substrates,
such  as  PEN,  PET,  PMMA  and  parylene,  to  realize  organic  or
organometallic flexible PHJ solar cells [ 203 , 204 ]. Normalized PCEs
as  a  function  of  bending  cycles  at  a  certain  bending  radius  are
usually  used  to  evaluate  the  mechanical  robustness  and  flex-
ural  rigidity  of  the  flexible  PHJ  solar  cells.  Yoon  et  al  fabri-
cated a flexible organometallic perovskite solar cell (PEDOT:PSS/Gr-
Mo/PEN) through transferring MoO x -functionalized graphene film
on  PEN  substrate. [205]  The  reference  flexible  solar  cell  (PE-
DOT:PSS/ITO/PEN) used ITO cathode and PEN substrate. After 10 0 0
bending cycles at a bending radius of 4 mm, an obvious crack was
formed  through  the  ITO  layer  and  propagated  into  the  photoac-
tive layer in the PEDOT:PSS/ITO/PEN solar cell ( Fig. 14 a), while the
graphene film in the PEDOT:PSS/Gr-Mo/PEN solar cell remained in-
tact ( Fig. 14 b). Owing to the occurrence of the fracture in the ITO
layer, the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS/ITO/PEN solar cell deteriorated sig-
nificantly from 17.3% to 4.3%, while the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS/Gr-
Mo/PEN solar cell remained 90% of its original value (16.8%), as in-
dicated in Fig. 14 c.

The  superiorities  of  graphene  and  SWNT  films  over  the  ITO
layer in terms of flexibility and mechanical robustness were also
utilized  in  the  flexible  organic  PHJ  solar  cells  [ 151 , 206 ].  Song
et al fabricated a flexible organic PHJ solar cell (Gr/Gr) by using
the  MoOx-functionalized  graphene  film  as  the  anode,  the  ZnO-
functionalized graphene film as the cathode on a PEN substrate,
70 BM  as  the  photoactive  layer.  The  reference
and  PDTP-DFBT:PC
flexible organic PHJ solar cells were ITO/Al (cathode is ITO, anode is
Al) and ITO/Gr (cathode is ITO, anode is graphene) with the same
photoactive layer. The photographs of the three organic solar cells
(ITO/Al, ITO/Gr and Gr/Gr) during bending tests at bending radii of
2.0, 1.2 and 0.7 mm were shown in Fig. 14 d. After 10 0 0 bending
cycles at a bending radius of 1.2 mm, the normalized PCE of the
Gr/Gr flexible organic PHJ solar cell remained unchanged, demon-
strating the highest flexibility, as shown in Fig. 14 e. The excellent
mechanical properties of the graphene and SWNT films could be
further exploited to realize more foldable and wearable PHJ solar
cells.

6. Challenges and future prospects

Based  on  the  above  discussions,  graphene  and  carbon  nan-
otubes  are  promising  enabling  technologies  to  reduce  Si  feed-
stock  utilization  as  well  as  realize  higher  PCEs  by  using  thinner
wafers and simplified cell architectures. Although the PCEs of the
graphene-based  and  CNT-based  PHJ  solar  cells  have  rocketed  to
14–17% in a short period, there is still plenty of room to further
improve the device performance by optimizing the preparation and
deposition processes of graphene and CNTs. First, it is still chal-
lenging to control diameter (chirality), alignment and crystallinity
of nanocarbon materials at the same time. For example, the Fermi
level of small-diameter semiconducting SWNTs could be shifted to
the largest extent, leading to a FF of 81% [207] for the nanocarbon-
based PHJ solar cells. Direct synthesis of sub-nanometer diameter
SWNT film [208] could be used to increase the J sc to 40 mA/cm 2 ,
and  V oc  to  0.75  eV,  which  leads  to  a  promising  PCE  of  24.3%.

Semiconducting  SWNT  films  could  also  absorb  solar  energy  and
contribute to the quantum efficiency of the device with suitable
choice  of  back  electrode  [209] .  Solar  energy  conversion  that  is
fully based on the bandgap of semiconducting SWNTs is also very
promising. A list of theoretical PCEs using SWNTs with different
chiralities  is  shown  in  Fig.  15 a.  As  an  example,  tandem  PHJ  so-
lar cells using (6,4), (9,1), (7,3) and (7,5) SWNTs yields a theoret-
ical PCE of 28% ( Fig. 15 b), which is extremely high considering the
narrow  bandgap  of  SWNTs  [210] .  Second,  the  interface  between
nanocarbon  film  and  c-Si  needs  in-depth  investigation.  It  is  still
not clear how the nanocarbon film would affect the growth of na-
tive  oxide  on  c-Si.  Moreover,  the  nature  of  the  contact  between

sp2 hybridized carbon and sp3 hybridized Si remains mysterious.
Third, the nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cells need standardized test
benchmark  to  make  fair  comparison.  For  example,  the  measure-
ment error can be very large for PHJ solar cells with 0.5 mm-radius
active area, as it is comparable to the carrier diffusion length [211] .
Also, there is still space to improve the stability of functionaliza-
tion of nanocarbon materials, thus more studies on the stability of
nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cells are required. Accelerated stabil-
ity test [212] at elevated temperature from 0 to 120 °C and humid
air environment needs to be established for nanocarbon-based PHJ
solar cells.

Recent advances on nanocarbon materials have been very en-
couraging  for  future  prospects  of  the  nanocarbon-based  PHJ  so-
lar cells. Direct synthesis could preserve the highest quality and
length  of  SWNTs  with  minimum  post-processing.  Breakthrough
studies on direct synthesis of mono-chiral (12,6), (14,4) and (8,4)
SWNTs  [213–216]  have  been  realized  very  recently  using  strate-
gically  designed  alloy  catalysts.  Application  of  the  mono-chiral
SWNTs in high-efficiency PHJ solar cells can be expected. More-
over, wafer-scale horizontally aligned SWNTs has been realized re-
cently  through  solution  based  method  [217] .  This  would  enable
solid-state light-matter coupling near the junction and confine the
generation of electron-hole pairs near the junction, which is crit-
ical to reduce the thickness of the photoactive materials. Another
outstanding property that has not been fully exploited is the me-
chanical flexibility of graphene and SWNTs. With few researches so
far, the PCEs of the flexible nanocarbon-based PHJ solar cells have
already achieved 8.42%, which is at the forefront of all the flexible
PHJ solar cells. We expect flexible graphene-based and CNT-based
PHJ solar cells with PCEs over 15% could be realized in the near
future, which would play a great role as ubiquitous power supply
for  portable  electronic  products  such  as  smart  phones,  wearable
devices and internet of things.

The industrial production of graphene and CNTs has been in-
creasing  exponentially  over  the  past  decades.  As  of  2013,  the
estimated  annual  production  of  CNTs  approached  5  kiloton/year
[23]  while  that  of  graphene  was  over  1  kiloton/year  [22] .  The
production  capacity  will  continue  to  increase  and  the  price  of
graphene and CNTs will be further reduced benefitted from the ex-
perience learning curve. Moreover, carbon is ubiquitous and Earth-
abundant  element,  while  indium,  as  the  major  composition  ele-
ment in ITO, is rare-earth metal with extremely limited reserve.
According to the report on the availability of indium from the Na-
tional Renewable Energy Laboratory and US Geological Survey, in-
dium reserves are an estimated 15,0 0 0 ton in total and the demand

of indium was projected to surpass the supply in 2015 [218] . The
limited supply results in very high prices of indium from $300–
900/kg,  which  makes  the  prices  of  ITO  film  even  higher  ($100–
500/cm 2 )  considering  the  complicated  processes.  The  synthesis
process of graphene and CNTs is extremely efficient and scalable.
With industrial-scale reactors and continuous production line, the
cost of graphene and CNT synthesis is orders of magnitude lower
than metal oxide based transparent conductive electrode [23] . Use
of  economic  feedstocks  such  as  industrial  exhaust  and  biomass
could further decrease the production cost substantially. Recently,
it has been reported that carbon dioxide could be used as precur-
sor to synthesize carbon nanotubes [219–221] . This could not only
further reduce the cost of graphene and CNT synthesis, but also
capture  and  solidify  carbon  emission,  making  nanocarbon-based
PHJ solar cell a negative carbon footprint device and paving the
way to address the issue of climate change.

7. Summary

The development of graphene-based and CNT-based PHJ solar
cells  relies  on  the  synergistic  progress  of  preparation  and  func-
tionalization of nanocarbon films, as well as design and fabrica-
tion of PHJ solar cells. In this review, we have summarized the key
strategies to improve the potential for practical and scalable de-
ployment of graphene-based and CNT-based PHJ solar cells. At the
nanoscale,  the  Fermi  level  of  graphene  and  CNTs  can  be  shifted
to  increase  carrier  mobility  and  built-in  potential,  which  facili-
tates selective charge transport and separation. Fermi level tuning
of graphene and CNTs can be realized through molecular adsorp-
tion,  electrochemical  gating  and  solid-state  functionalization.  By
appropriate functionalization process, the graphene/CNT top elec-
trode layer could be paired with either p-type or n-type photoac-
tive layer to form PHJ solar cells, which offers flexible design of
novel solar cell structures. At the microscale, the morphologies of

graphene and CNTs could be modified to efficiently organize charge
separation and transport near the interface. Design and fabrication
of  three-dimensional  hierarchical  architectures  of  graphene  and
CNTs  could  decouple  electrical  and  optical  conductivities,  which
overcomes the trade-off for TCFs. Hybrid or composite structures
of graphene/CNTs with other materials could also achieve multi-
functionalization and improve PCEs. At the macroscale, device level
optimization was mostly inspired by the accumulated technologi-
cal know-how of Si-based and GaAs-based solar cells. Tuning of in-
terfacial oxide thickness and insertion of atomic-thin 2D materials
could effectively change the band alignment to prevent Fermi level
pinning and charge carrier recombination. For light management,
the ARC could effectively harvest light reflection, while plasmonic
effect could confine the solar absorption near the interface. With
sophistication  of  carbon  nanomaterials  and  its  integration  with
current  c-Si  and  GaAs  production  technology,  we  believe  that
nanocarbon-based  PHJ  solar  cells  will  soon  have  an  impact  on
global energy production at the terawatt scale.

Kehang  Cui  received  Ph.D.  in  Mechanical  Engineering
from the University of Tokyo in 2014, under the guid-
ance of Prof. Shigeo Maruyama. He then worked as a
project researcher at the same group. In April 2015, he
was awarded a scientific research funding “JSPS Grant-in-
Aid for Young Scientists” and became a Principal Inves-
tigator at the University of Tokyo. Since August 2015, he
works as a postdoctoral associate at Department of Me-
chanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy (MIT), with Prof. John Hart and Prof. Brian Wardle.
His research interests include photovoltaics, solar-thermal
conversion and multifunctional nanocomposites.

Shigeo Maruyama received Ph.D. in School of Engineer-
ing from the University of Tokyo in 1988. He worked as
a research associate until 1991, as a lecturer for a year,
as an associate professor from 1993, as a full professor
from 2004, and as a distinguished professor from 2014 at
the University of Tokyo. From April 2015, he works as a
cross-appointment fellow for Advanced Industrial science
and technology (AIST). From 2016, He is also serving as
guest professor at Peking University. He joined Professor
Richard Smalley group at Rice University as visiting fel-
low for about 2 years during 1989 through 1991. During
this period, he started to study chemical physics of clus-
ters, fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes. Later, he invented
the new CVD technique of SWNTs from low pressure alcohol in 2002, so-called Al-
cohol Catalytic CVD (ACCVD). Current research topics are growth, optical charac-
terization, thermal characterization and solar cell application of carbon nanotubes
and graphene. He has been served the president of “The Fullerenes, Nanotubes and
Graphene Research Society ,” since 2011, and the co-chair of steering committee of
Carbon Nanotube conferences ( International Conference on Science and Application of
Nanotubes and Low-Dimensional Materials ) since 2016.
