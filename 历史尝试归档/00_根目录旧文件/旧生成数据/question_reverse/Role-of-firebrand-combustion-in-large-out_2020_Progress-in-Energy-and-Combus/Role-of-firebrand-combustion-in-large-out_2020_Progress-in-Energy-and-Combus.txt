Large outdoor ﬁres are an increasing danger to the built environment. Wildﬁres that spread into com- 
munities, labeled as Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) ﬁres, are an example of large outdoor ﬁres. Other 
examples of large outdoor ﬁres are urban ﬁres including those that may occur after earthquakes as well 
as in informal settlements. When vegetation and structures burn in large outdoor ﬁres, pieces of burn- 
ing material, known as ﬁrebrands, are generated, become lofted, and may be carried by the wind. This 
results in showers of wind-driven ﬁrebrands that may land ahead of the ﬁre front, igniting vegetation 
and structures, and spreading the ﬁre very fast. Post-ﬁre disaster studies indicate that ﬁrebrand show- 
ers are a signiﬁcant factor in the ﬁre spread of multiple large outdoor ﬁres. The present paper provides 
a comprehensive literature summary on the role of ﬁrebrand mechanisms on large outdoor ﬁre spread. 
Experiments, models, and simulations related to ﬁrebrand generation, lofting, burning, transport, deposi- 
tion, and ignition of materials are reviewed. Japan, a country that has been greatly inﬂuenced by ignition 
induced by ﬁrebrands that have resulted in severe large outdoor ﬁres, is also highlighted here as most of 
this knowledge remains not available in the English language literature. The paper closes with a summary 
of the key research needs on this globally important problem.

1. Introduction 

Large outdoor ﬁres represent an increasing problem of global 
importance.  Wildland  ﬁres  that  spread  into  urban  areas,  termed 
Wildland-Urban  Interface  (WUI)  ﬁres,  are  becoming  more  and 
more  prevalent  across  multiple  continents  [1] .  In  many  regions 
throughout the world, population centers are densely populated. In 
such areas, the risk exists for large urban ﬁres. The USA has a long 
history of large urban ﬁres such as the Great Chicago Fire in 1872, 
the Baltimore Fire in 1904, and ﬁres following the San Francisco 
Earthquakes in 1906. In Japan, in particular, there is also a long 
history of such urban ﬁres, such as the Meireki Fire in 1657, the 
ﬁres following the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, the 1934 Hako- 
date Fire, and the 1976 Sakata Fire [2,3] . 

In the developing world, there are many informal settlements. 
In both South Africa and the Philippines, these informal settlement 
ﬁres have resulted in vast destruction and left many homeless. As 
an example, on March 2017, more than 2900 dwellings were de- 
stroyed that resulted in more than 9500 people homeless at the 
Imizamo Yethu informal settlement in South Africa. 

A commonality in the rapid spread of large outdoor ﬁres, such 
as WUI ﬁres, urban ﬁres, and informal settlement ﬁres, are the pro- 
duction or generation of new, far smaller combustible fragments 
from the original ﬁre source referred to as ﬁrebrands. In the case 
of WUI ﬁres, the production of ﬁrebrands occurs from the com- 
bustion dynamics of vegetative and man-made fuel elements, such 
as homes and other structures. For urban ﬁres and informal settle- 
ment ﬁres, ﬁrebrands are produced primarily from man-made fuel 
elements. 

An example of the importance of ﬁrebrand processes in WUI 
ﬁres  are  collectively  named  the  October  Fire  Siege  of  2017,  that 
burnt large portions of Napa and Sonoma counties in Northern Cal- 
ifornia wine country. Videos show ﬁrebrand showers igniting veg- 
etation and structures [4] . The largest of the ﬁres in the siege, the 
Tubbs Fire, set the record at the time as the most destructive WUI 
ﬁre in California history and ranked 3rd for the most-deadly WUI 
ﬁre in California History [5] . Three other ﬁres in the siege are also 
on the CALFIRE list of the Top 20 Most Destructive California WUI 
ﬁres [6] . Altogether the ﬁre siege consisted of a peak number of 
21  major  ﬁres,  killed  a  total  of  43  people,  burned  over  10 0,0 0 0 
hectares, forced the evacuation of 10 0,0 0 0 people, and destroyed 
an estimated 8900 structures [5] . 

Later in December 2017 WUI ﬁres also raged in Southern Cali- 
fornia. The largest one, the Thomas Fire (Ventura County) became 
at the time the largest WUI in California history, burning 114,0 0 0 
hectares – more than the total area burned by all the ﬁres in the 
October Fire Siege of 2017 [7] . If this was not enough, in Novem- 
ber  2018,  again  in  Northern  California,  the  Camp  Fire  broke  all 
the  records  becoming  the  most  destructive  ﬁre  to  date  [8]  with 
a total of at least 86 people dead, an estimated 18,800 structures 
destroyed and over 153,0 0 0 hectares burnt [8] , with most of the 
damage taking place within the ﬁrst few hours. In all these ﬁres 
there are many reports of ﬁrebrand showers igniting structures and 
vegetation. While two detailed examples of WUI ﬁre destruction 
are provided for the USA, the interested reader is referred to a de- 

tailed report as part of an ISO TC92 Task Group that provides a 
global overview [2] . 

The 1934 Hakodate Fire in Japan produced more than 20 spot 
ﬁres, with wind speeds of 20 m/s (72 km/h) reported, resulting in 
more than 11,0 0 0 structures lost and 20 0 0 fatalities [9] . A more 
recent  example  of  the  importance  of  ﬁrebrand  processes  in  ur- 
ban ﬁres occurred in the City of Itoigawa Niigata Prefecture, Japan 
on December 2016. Speciﬁcally, this ﬁre broke out from a Chinese 
restaurant,  and  on  the  day  of  the  ﬁre,  strong  winds  resulted  in 
rapid ﬁre spread. With the presence of an average wind speed of 
9 m/s (32 km/h), the ﬁre quickly spread, resulting in the damage of 
147 structures, with 120 destroyed [10] . After the March 2011 Great 
East Japan Earthquake, there were many urban ﬁres as a result of 
the tsunami although these ﬁres were not linked to ﬁrebrand pro- 
cesses [2] . 

The  present  paper  provides  a  comprehensive  literature  sum- 
mary on the role of ﬁrebrands on large outdoor ﬁre spread. While 
previous reviews have explored aspects of the problem before [11–
16] , there has yet to be a focused review on the physical mecha- 
nisms governing ﬁrebrand propagation. Experiments, models, and 
simulations related to ﬁrebrand generation, lofting, burning, trans- 
port, deposition, and ignition of materials are presented. Previous 
work  from Japan, a country  that has been greatly inﬂuenced by 
ignition induced by ﬁrebrands that have resulted in severe large 
outdoor ﬁres, is also highlighted here as most of this knowledge 
remains not available in the open, English language literature. 

2. Overview of physical ﬁrebrand mechanisms 

In  the  most  simplistic  representation,  ﬁre  development  asso- 
ciated with ﬁrebrands may be divided into several sub-processes 
[12] : the generation of ﬁrebrands, their transport by plume lofting 
and drag forces with the wind, deposition onto and ignition of fuel 
beds by either ﬂaming or smoldering, and the subsequent surface 
spread of the ﬁre (these subsequent ﬁre spread processes are not 
reviewed here). These sub-processes are illustrated in Fig. 1 and 
described brieﬂy below. 

2.1. Firebrand generation 

Firebrands are primarily generated from burning wildland fu- 
els (grasses, shrubs, trees) and wooden structures (structural mem- 
bers, shakes, shingles). They are produced when the burning fuels 
that carry the ﬁre thermally decompose, lose structural integrity, 
and break into smaller burning pieces. These burning pieces may 
separate from the larger parent fuel due to the drag forces from 
the airﬂow surrounding the burning material and lofted by buoy- 
ant  ﬁre-induced  plumes  [17] .  Although  less  common,  ﬁrebrands 
can  also  be  generated  by  power  line  interactions  with  trees  or 
structures [18] . The characteristics of the ﬁrebrands depend on the 
type of the fuel (vegetation or structure), its morphology (geom- 
etry,  size,  porosity,  density)  and  the  intensity  of  the  originating 
ﬁre and buoyant plume characteristics. In addition to the physical 
characteristics of the ﬁre the ﬁrebrands may be ﬂaming or glowing 
(smoldering).

2.2. Firebrand transport 

The  transport  of  the  ﬁrebrands  by  the  ﬁre  plume  and  ambi- 
ent wind is the most studied aspect of the ﬁrebrand spotting pro- 
cess since the nature of the transport processes lends itself to sim- 
ple calculation methodologies following Newton’s laws of motion 
(see  Fig.  2 ),  although  the  combustion  characteristics  of  the  ﬁre- 
brand complicates these calculations. After the ﬁrebrands are gen- 
erated, they are lofted by the ﬁre plume and/or transported by am- 
bient winds. An important but less studied aspect of the transport 
has been the accumulation of ﬁrebrands near obstacles, which has 
been only recently studied. 

the gas phase as a ﬂame. This complex ignition process depends on 
several factors, including the characteristics of the ﬁrebrands upon 
landing (wood type, size, and state of combustion), the character- 
istics of the fuel bed on which the ﬁrebrand(s) lands (fuel type, 
temperature, density, porosity, void fraction, moisture content) and 
environmental conditions (wind speed, relative humidity, temper- 
ature). Naturally, a study of this complexity needs to be parame- 
terized so that the effects of different parameters can be analyzed, 
and predictive models can be developed.

generation processes 

2.3. Ignition induced by ﬁrebrands 

3.1. Firebrand generation studies 

Perhaps the most important aspect of the ﬁrebrand problem is 
whether a ﬁrebrand or a shower of ﬁrebrands is capable of ignit- 
ing a fuel bed after landing on it. Upon impingement on the fuel 
bed, ﬁrebrands may be in a ﬂaming state, smoldering state, or they 
may be minimally reacting and just cooling. If enough energy is 
transferred from the ﬁrebrand to the adjacent fuel bed, the fuel 
will heat up and may start to pyrolyze while the ﬁrebrand loses 
energy in the process. The heat released from the ﬁrebrand’s reac- 
tion can also initiate self-sustained smoldering of the fuel bed that 
eventually may undergo transition into ﬂaming. Alternatively, the 
pyrolyzate may quickly mix with ambient air, forming a ﬂammable 
gaseous mixture near the ﬁrebrands which can directly ignite in 

Firebrands  are  generated  from  structures  such  as  houses  and 
buildings  as  well  as  vegetation  such  as  trees  and  shrubs.  There 
is  not  yet  a  clear  understanding  of  ﬁrebrand  generation  mecha- 
nisms from structures while a fundamental understanding of ﬁre- 
brand generation from vegetation has been obtained to some de- 
gree. Generation of ﬁrebrands is complex as many factors inﬂuence 
their generation, regardless of the source. Ambient wind speeds, 
ﬁre-generated winds, and the geometry, distribution, and material 
composition  of  vegetation  or  structures  all  play  a  role.  Without 
a comprehensive understanding of this process, it is not possible 
to fully parameterize the size, shape, mass, and energy character- 
istics of generated ﬁrebrands. Numerous experiments and several 

4

numerical studies have gathered data which will help to inform 
future predictive capabilities. 

3.2. Firebrand generation knowledge collected from real ﬁres 

As each real ﬁre differs in its intensity and rate of growth, ex- 
posure conditions from the ﬁre to elements that may generate ﬁre- 
brands are often diﬃcult to determine. Parameters that may be of 
interest include the actual heat release rate (HRR) of the ﬁre, the 
makeup of fuels involved, details of the suppression effort, if any, 
and ambient conditions such as the wind speed. During a real ﬁre, 
it is diﬃcult to know that information with the spatial and tem- 
poral  resolution  necessary  to  understand  the  generation  of  ﬁre- 
brands using current limited diagnostics. Most investigations are 
performed after the event has concluded. Controlled conditions in 
the laboratory, however, can offer limited ambient conditions that 
are easier to understand and draw trends from. Nonetheless, infor- 
mation obtained from actual ﬁre events is invaluable to important 
validation and veriﬁcation on all laboratory experiments. 

Previous  post-ﬁre  investigation  reports  mentioned  ﬁrebrand 
generation from structures [19–21] , with some recent reports in- 
cluding  photos  and  videos  of  ﬁrebrands  observed  during  these 
ﬁres. While the majority of ﬁrebrands observed or reported dur- 
ing these investigations are relatively small in size, resembling a 
‘shower,’ ‘rain,’ or ‘blizzard,’ of ﬁrebrands, some observations have 
noted  lofted  ﬁrebrands  are  large.  Firebrands,  however,  may  look 
larger or smaller than they actually are during observations taken 
in  a  critical  incident,  so  care  must  be  exercised  with  regard  to 
interpretation of eyewitness accounts. The vast majority of small, 
glowing ﬁrebrands are most likely hard to observe during daylight 
hours, and even during the night ﬂaming ﬁrebrands will be easier 
to see. 

Until recently, there has been very little effort to collect actual 
information on ﬁrebrands during post-ﬁre investigations. After the 
Angora  Fire  in  California,  USA  in  2007,  a  trampoline  with  holes 
burned by ﬁrebrands was observed. In this ﬁre, the wildland fuels 
consisted of conifer forests of White Fire-Jeffery Pine. The oppor- 
tunity was used to collect samples and the size of the holes was 
analyzed [22] . This was among the ﬁrst information on ﬁrebrand 
size distributions produced in an actual WUI ﬁre. More than 85 % 
of the holes had an area less than 0.5 cm 2 , corroborating the as- 
sumption of the mostly small nature of ﬁrebrands. Another set of 
experiments were later conducted which conﬁrmed that the sizes 
of holes melted through trampoline material indeed corresponded 
to the size of deposited glowing ﬁrebrands [22] . While it is diﬃcult 
to say which holes were made from ﬁrebrands from structures or 
vegetation, the majority of ﬁrebrands were small. The same proce- 
dure was later used to investigate ﬁrebrand exposure in the Bas- 
trop Complex Fire in Texas, USA in 2011 [23] . Seven trampolines 
were collected within the burned area, and holes in those trampo- 
lines were measured. The ﬁndings were similar – more than 90% 
of ‘holes’ in 7 trampolines were less than 0.5 cm 2 . 

Firebrands have also been collected in several post urban ﬁre 
investigations  [10,24-26] .  In  the  Beppu-Fire  in  Japan  on  January 
2010 (average wind speed of 10 m/s or 36 km/h), ﬁrebrands were 
collected and compared with their travel distances [24] . The fur- 
thest travel distance was 1160 m from the origin of the ﬁre. Com- 
paring this travel distance with the thickness, projected area, and 
mass of each ﬁrebrand, researchers reported a linear relationship 
between the projected area and mass of a ﬁrebrand, and a quali- 
tative relationship between the maximum length transported and 
the projected area. They did not ﬁnd any particular correlations be- 
tween the travel distance and characteristics of ﬁrebrands. Another 
post-ﬁre investigation reported that the size and mass of ﬁrebrands 
collected from the ﬁres under low wind speeds were also linearly 
correlated [25] . 

Fig. 3.  Comparison with ﬁrebrand data from Itoigawa-city ﬁre [10] and Beppu-city 
ﬁre [24] . Five ﬁrebrands with the project area bigger than 20 cm 2 
are omitted from 
this graph to focus on the smaller ﬁrebrands. 

In  a  post-ﬁre  investigation  of  the  Itoigawa-City  Fire  in  Japan 
on  December  2016,  ﬁrebrands  were  collected  after  the  ﬁre  and 
the size and the mass of each ﬁrebrand were measured [10,26] . 
At least 10 spot ﬁres were reported. While the largest ﬁrebrands 
found in the ﬁre had a mass of 114 g, the majority of collected 
ﬁrebrands had a projected area less than 10 cm 2 , similar to data 
from  the  Beppu-City  Fire  (shown  in  Fig.  3 )  and  structure  com- 
bustion experiments described later. If the origin of the ﬁrebrands 
was assumed or known, the distance from the origin of the ﬁre 
could be compared with the characteristics of collected ﬁrebrands. 
The Tachikawa number (Ta), representing the ratio of aerodynamic 
forces to gravitational forces, was used to correlate these ﬁndings 
by treating ﬁrebrands as windborne debris, assuming size and den- 
sity remain constant [27] : 

Ta = 

ρ∞ U 2 A pro j 
2 m F g 

(1) 

where  ρ
air  is  the  density  of  ambient  air,  U  is  an  average  wind 
speed experienced by the particle, m F  is the mass of a ﬁrebrand, 
A 
proj  is  the  projected  area  of  a  ﬁrebrand,  and  g  is  the  gravita- 
tional acceleration. The larger the Tachikawa number, the further 
a windborne debris, or ﬁrebrand, can travel. While the approach is 
promising, the results were not conclusive as it was diﬃcult to de- 
termine the precise origin of individual ﬁrebrands. The same issue 
arose in post-ﬁre investigations of the Beppu-City ﬁre [24] ; how- 
ever, an experiment burning a three-story school [28] had more 
success owing to its clear, single ﬁre origin (the school building). 
This shows the diﬃculty in ﬁnding the exact travel distance and 
ﬁrebrand source location in real ﬁres. 

It must be emphasized that it is important to gather ﬁrebrand 
information  from  real  ﬁres.  While  obtaining  ﬁrebrand  data  from 
real ﬁres always comes with unknown parameters, such as build- 
ing materials, the precise ﬁre origin, and the exact ﬁre size, this 
information is still critical to be able to yield insights into the over-

3.3. Understanding ﬁrebrand generation from vegetation – laboratory 
studies 

Firebrand  production  from  vegetation  has  been  studied,  both 
theoretically and experimentally in the laboratory and in the ﬁeld. 
Early  laboratory  experiments  to  investigate  ﬁrebrands  from  full- 
scale tree combustion were performed by using Douglas-ﬁr trees 
( Pseudotsuga menziesii) 5.2 m in height with a 3 m wide maximum 
girth at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
[17] . No wind was applied, and ﬁrebrands were collected by pans 
ﬁlled  with  water.  Prior  experiments  of  Douglas-ﬁr  tree  combus- 
tion, conducted not for the purposes of ﬁrebrand collection, but for 
heat-release rate measurements, suggested three regimes of com- 
bustion based on tree moisture content (MC): a regime which was 
not possible to sustain combustion, a transition regime where trees 
would partially combust, and a vigorous combustion regime [29] . 
These MC regimes were used as a basis for the ﬁrebrand tree com- 
bustion experiments. Trees with 50% MC partially burned with no 
ﬁrebrands produced while the trees with 18% MC were engulfed 
in ﬂames after only 20 s after ignition, producing numerous ﬁre- 
brands. Firebrands collected from trees with 18% MC had cylindri- 
cal shapes with an average size of 4 mm in diameter and a length 
of  53  mm.  The  surface  area  was  calculated  and  plotted  against 
mass, shown in Fig. 4 . This relationship is useful when compar- 
ing area-based measurements of ﬁrebrands to the mass, which is 
more closely related to energy content, and its inﬂuence on igni- 
tion. In addition, another experimental series was performed with 
Douglas-ﬁr  trees  (Pseudotsuga  menziesii)  2.4  m  in  height  with  a 
1.5  m  wide  maximum  girth  [17] .  The  average  size  of  ﬁrebrands 
was 3 mm in diameter and a length of 40 mm. This relationship 
was later studied using scaling analyses between ﬁrebrand mass 
and projected area for cylindrical ﬁrebrands, ﬁnding that the sur- 
face area should be related in power-law form to the mass to the 
2/3 power [30] . While useful, this power law relationship should 
be evaluated for a more diverse set of fuel types. 

Korean pine (Pinus koaiensis) , which is native to China, Japan, 
and Korea, was combusted at the Building Research Institute (BRI) 
Fire Research Wind Tunnel Facility (FRWTF) to investigate the dif- 
ference  in  ﬁrebrand  production  from  different  tree  species  [31] ; 
no wind was applied. The height was kept constant at 4.0 m, and 
pans with water were placed around the tree for the ﬁrebrand col- 
lection.  With  no  data  available  for  Korean  pine  combustion  and 
MC, experiments were performed with different MC. In order to 
have Korean pine combusted completely with a signiﬁcant num- 
ber of ﬁrebrands produced, it was found that MC had to be kept 
below 35% without any wind applied. The burn progressed some- 
what sporadically, taking more than 2 min to complete. This was 
almost double duration for Douglas-ﬁr trees (50–60 s). Firebrands 
were found to be cylindrical in shape with an average diameter of 
5 mm and average length of 34 mm. The mass and size of ﬁre- 
brands is also shown in Fig. 4 . 

The total mass of ﬁrebrands produced from each tree size was 
normalized with the mass lost from the tree during the burn as 
well as initial mass of the tree, shown in Fig. 5 . While Douglas-ﬁr 
trees showed a decrease in ﬁrebrand production (almost half) with 
an increase in tree height (almost double), Korean pine trees pro- 
duced a larger ratio of mass of ﬁrebrands compared with Douglas- 
ﬁr trees. With the ratio of burnable parts (needles and twigs) of 
Douglas-ﬁr and Korean pine being similar, this reﬂects the differ- 
ence of burning behavior between the two species. As mentioned 
previously, it took more than 2 min for Korean pine to burn com- 
pletely while Douglas-ﬁr trees burned out completely in 50–60 s 
for  both  heights  tested.  Douglas-ﬁr  trees  also  have  a  fuller,  less 
open structure than Korean pine. The (HRR) estimated during the 
experiments in each case showed that, as for similar MC, Douglas- 
ﬁr burns produced higher HRR than Korean pine [32,33] . The au- 
thors concluded that, as most of ﬁrebrands produced or collected 
in this series were relatively small, the more intense ﬁre plume 
from higher HRR Douglas ﬁr burns might have consumed smaller 
ﬁrebrands completely before collection [31] .

following years, and ﬁrebrands were also collected [36] . This data 
also matches with ﬁrebrand data from the Angora Fire [22] . 

Another  set  of  prescribed  ﬁres  were  performed  in  2016  with 
some  improved  ﬁrebrand  measurement  technology  [37] .  Pans 
ﬁlled  with  water  were  still  used  to  collect  deposited  ﬁrebrands, 
but  without  a  plastic  ﬁlm.  The  average  ﬁrebrand  ﬂux  col- 
lected  in  the  previously-described  pans  was  correlated  to  the 
ﬁre  intensity  which  produced  these  ﬁrebrands,  ranging  between 
7.35 MW ± 3.48 MW and 12.59 MW ± 5.87 MW. The average ﬁre- 
brand ﬂux was determined based on the total number of ﬁrebrands 
collected divided by the time over which they were collected start- 
ing with the time the ﬁrst ﬁrebrand deposited in the containers to 
the last ﬁrebrand deposition in the containers. Video recording re- 
vealed that the peak ﬁrebrand ﬂux lasted for only one or two min- 
utes. As expected, higher ﬁre intensities produced more ﬁrebrands, 
peaking at 0.82–1.36 m −2 s −1 . A summary of measured ﬁrebrand 
densities from these experiments is shown in Table 1 .

studies

tion to those collected from ﬁeld scale burns. [17,31,35] . 

While leaves from trees can often be considered to burn out 
before becoming ﬁrebrands, leaves on the ground may behave as 
(ﬂaming) ﬁrebrands, especially under windy conditions. Firebrands 
from leaves have been observed during ﬂame spread experiments 
with  leaves  under  a  2  m/s  wind  and  an  18-degree  slope. When 
wind was higher than 4 m/s, spotting ﬁres by ﬂaming leaves was 
also observed [34] . 

3.4. Understanding ﬁrebrand generation from vegetation – ﬁeld 
studies 

A series of ﬁeld experiments in the Pinelands National Reserve, 
New  Jersey,  in  the  USA  has  been  performed  as  a  part  of  pre- 
scribed  burns  over  several  years,  from  2013  to  2016.  Firebrands 
were collected during the prescribed burns, and effort s were made 
to  link  ﬁrebrand  data  with  vegetation,  velocity  (wind  and  ﬁre- 
brands), combustion state (burning or non-burning), travel distance 
(distance from the ﬁre front location) and ﬁre intensity (ﬁre size). 
Unfortunately, the collection method and the obtained characteris- 
tics of ﬁrebrands were changed over years, which made compari- 
son of ﬁrebrands rather diﬃcult. In 2013, ﬁrebrands were collected 
in three locations using pans ﬁlled with water and a thin plastic 
layer on top through which only reacting ﬁrebrands would be ex- 
pected to penetrate [35] . They distinguished ﬁrebrands from bark 
and those from twigs. Most bark fragments had a 1–2 mm thick- 
ness, while 70% of branch fragments collected had diameters be- 
tween 2 mm and 4 mm. The thickness and the cross-sectional area 
of ﬁrebrands were compared with data from [17,31] in Fig. 6 , which 
shows the data from experiments in the laboratory matched well 
with those from the ﬁeld. Prescribed burns were performed in the 

Modeling ﬁrebrand generation from vegetation, such as a tree, 
ﬁrst requires a mathematical description of the shape of the tree, 
followed by a model for the mechanical strength of tree branches, 
and eventually, degradation of the mechanical strength over time. 
Description of the geometry of a tree was ﬁrst introduced by Man- 
delbrot [38] as a fractal geometry, and Collin et al. [39] incorpo- 
rated this concept into computational methods.  They assumed a 
geometry with no  leaves and where one branch splits only  into 
two. The ratio of mass between two successive branches ( m 
i + 1 and 
i , respectively) was described by the fractal similarity:

This equation shows that the mass of the branch ( m ) decreases 
as the nominal diameter decreases ( D ), with ρs the solid density, 
V the branch volume, and A the aspect ratio. This equation may 
be different if the assumed tree has either leaves or one branch 
splitting into more than two. 

In Barr and Ezekoye [40] the pyrolysis and oxidation degrada- 
tion process for a woody element was assumed; as pyrolysis hap- 
pens at lower temperature, pyrolysis was ﬁrst considered, with a 
decrease in the density and strength of branches but no associated 
oxidation or regression of the element. In a second step, a constant 
density and strength were assumed and shape and size changes 
were considered [40] . Breakage was assumed to occur either when 
the branch becomes fragile due to the decrease of strength from 
pyrolysis or when the branch becomes fragile due to the diameter 
reduction from oxidation. 

Assuming a cylindrical branch, the decrease of branch diameter 

( D ) by oxidation can be described as a function of time:

sumed for the Nusselt number, and γ and η are constants from 
the Reynolds number included in that correlation. The thermal dif- 
fusivity, the density, and the kinematic viscosity of air are repre- 
sented as αa , ρa , and v a . If the external ﬂow U is constant, it is 
possible to integrate over the oxidation time t ox  from the initial

A given branch i is subject to a different load, and the diameter 
reaches the critical diameter at which the branch fractures. Each 
branch is subjected to the force from its own weight and a drag 
force from a plume. It is assumed that the external ﬂow velocity is 
in the opposite direction of the gravitational force. Therefore, the 
bending moment, M , at the base of branch i can be described as:

The  branch  is  then  assumed  to  break  off when  Eqs.  (8)  and

This data was then used as input for ﬁrebrand transport. Barr 
and Ezekoye [40] performed three-point bending experiments on 
thermally degraded yellow poplar ( Liriodendron tulipifera ) dowels 

using  an  oven  for  heating  with  different  densities  and  found  a 
linear relationship between ﬂexural strength and density. This re- 
lationship is further conﬁrmed with poplar, birch, and oak using 
heating  provided  by  a  diffusion  ﬂame  by  Caton  [41] .  They  also 
provide a simpliﬁed nondimensional relationship between degra- 
dation  of  wooden  dowels  and  the  ﬂexural  strength  required  for

where L 0 and D 0 are the initial length and diameter of the dowel, 
νRT is the Poisson’s ratio in the radial plane R and in the transverse 
direction T in the RTL coordinate system, α is the species’ thermal 
diffusivity,  ˙m is the mass loss rate, E L is the modulus of elasticity 
in the longitudinal direction, ρs  is the density of wood cell wall 
material, and P ∞  and ρ∞  are the ambient pressure and density, 
respectively. The ﬁrst parameter can be interpreted as the ratio of 
the average burning rate of the material to its scaled mechanical 
stiffness, and the second a non-dimensional representation of the 
recoverable plastic strain in the transverse direction of the dow- 
els. Ultimately two failure modes are found, one dominated by the 
fracture strength of larger members and the other by the burning 
rate for smaller members. A fractal approach to modeling a tree 
has also been used in other work, such as estimating the radiant 
heat from a tree [32] . 

Tohidi et al. [30] modeled ﬁrebrands based on experimental ob- 
servations by Manzello et al. [17,31] , assuming a cylindrical shape. 
It was assumed that a branch or a twig is broken off from a larger 
branch by shear stresses related to bending due to weight or drag. 
This is also used as input data for transport studies. 

The challenge for these modeling studies is simply a lack of ex- 
perimental data to be able to validate these models over a broad 
parameter space. It cannot be overstated that more experimental 
data is required to guide future modeling efforts. 

3.6. Understanding ﬁrebrand generation from structures 

3.6.1. Wood crib as a surrogate 

As a part of attempts towards understanding ﬁrebrand produc- 
tion  and  providing  validation  data  for  future  simulations,  wood 
cribs have been used as surrogates for buildings [42] . Hayashi and 
Iwami investigated the effect of the size of wood cribs under dif- 
ferent wind conditions and its effect on the mass of ﬁrebrands col- 
lected downstream. Wood cribs were all 450 mm in height with 
square widths and lengths of 10 0 0 mm, 150 0 mm, and 20 0 0 mm 
( Table 2 ). The mass of the wooden cribs and number of ﬁrebrands 
produced were tracked as a function of time, with the later sam- 
pled  every  30  s.  Pans  with  water  and  an  overhead  CCD  camera 
were placed at three downstream locations for each experiment. 
A total of 2095 ﬁrebrands were collected for all the experiments 
performed, with the majority of ﬁrebrands having a mass between 
0.005 g and 0.01 g. As the wind speed increased, the average mass 
as well as the production rate of ﬁrebrands collected were also in- 
creased slowly at lower wind speeds then rapidly at higher wind 
speeds shown in Fig. 7 . The ﬁrebrand production rate also expe- 
rienced a sudden increase near the end of experiments when the 
wood crib collapsed. 

3.6.2. Structure combustion studies 

Effort s to understand ﬁrebrand generation from building struc- 
tures started with Vodvorka’s residential house burn experiments 
[43,44] , Five residential houses were burned [43] , and ﬁrebrands 
were collected using polyurethane sheets placed downwind from 
the houses, along with other data such as radiation, burning time, 
and  ﬁre  spread  rates.  Five  houses  were  tested  in  these  experi- 
ments;  three  out  of  ﬁve  were  standard  frame  construction  with

duction; the higher the total pressure was, the larger number and 
larger mass of ﬁrebrands were produced. 

Many  researchers  have  used  containers  ﬁlled  with  water  for 
ﬁrebrand collection. Without water, ﬁrebrands continue combus- 
tion to burn and it is possible for ﬁrebrands to become ash by the 
time of collection. Experiments in BRI’s FRWTF conﬁrmed some of 
these  observations.  Five  experiments  were  performed  under  dif- 
ferent conditions such as wind speeds or materials used for the 
mock-up structure built for the experiments [46] . Firebrands were 
collected in three out of ﬁve experiments. Two pans, one with wa- 
ter (wet pan) and the other without water (dry pan), were used to 
collect ﬁrebrands in two of those experiments. Pans were placed 
1 m downstream from the house symmetry. All experimental con- 
ditions are shown in Table 3 . The average mass of ﬁrebrands col- 
lected in wet pans was smaller than those collected in dry pans 
yet the total number of ﬁrebrands from wet pans was larger than 
those from dry pans. The higher wind speed produced the largest 
ﬁrebrands, along with a large number of small ﬁrebrands with a 
projected area up to 2 cm 2 . The number of ﬁrebrands in the pans 
was counted every ﬁve minutes via video recording in one case. It 
was observed the largest number of ﬁrebrands was produced and 
deposited in both pans upon ﬂashover in the structure. Increases 
in ﬁrebrand production were also noted upon wall or roof collapse 
and start of ﬂame ejections out of the structure though the roof or 
wall. 

A three-story wooden school burn with the dimension of 50 m 
(L) x 16 m (W) x 15 m (H) was conducted in Tsukuba, Japan to 
study ﬁre safety of wooden school buildings [28,47] . Along with 
heat ﬂux, temperature, and ﬁre prevention strategies tested, ﬁre- 
brands were also collected after the experiment [28,47] . The dis- 
tance from the origin of ﬁre was measured along with the charac- 
teristics of ﬁrebrands. The size and the mass of ﬁrebrands for each 
size class and for each location showed linear relationships regard- 
less of size class and location (namely, the mass of ﬁrebrands is 
proportional  to  the  projected  area  of  ﬁrebrand).  They  found  the 
values of slope decreased as the travel distance increased and as 
the size of ﬁrebrands became smaller. More than 60% of ﬁrebrands 
were between the size of 1–3 cm regardless of the location. 

While it is interesting to burn an entire structure in order to 
obtain  ﬁrebrands,  it  is  hard  to  control  all  the  parameters  which 
may or may not affect the production. Hence, a systematic series 
of  experiments  were  conducted  with  decreasing  scale  and  com- 
plexity: a real-scale structure, a simple full-scale structure combus- 
tion experiment, full-scale building components combustion exper- 
iments, and bench-scale building components [48–53] combustion 
experiments. In all experiments, ﬁrebrands were collected in pans 
with water, and the projected area and the mass of each ﬁrebrand 
were measured in the same manner for all experiments in order to 
keep consistency to directly compare results. 

First, a real-structure burn experiment was conducted in Cali- 
fornia, USA, as part of ﬁreﬁghter training [48] . Firebrands were col- 
lected in two locations, 4 m and 18 m from the structure. An av- 
erage wind velocity of 6 m/s was measured during the burn. Fire- 
brands were found to be made from wood and tar paper. All the

wood  sidings,  one  was  asphalt  siding  applied  over  sheet  rock, 
and the other was a brick veneer over a wood frame. Firebrands 
burned though the polyurethane sheets and left holes that were 
used  for  the  measurements.  The  total  number  of  ﬁrebrands  col- 
lected from these structure ﬁres was 4748. Eighty-nine percent of 
ﬁrebrands collected in these experiments were found to be smaller 
than 0.23 cm 2 . The largest number of ﬁrebrands were observed to 
be produced upon the roof collapse. Vodvorka [43,44] , also pro- 
duced another study with eight structures, ﬁve of which were two- 
and-a-half-story wood houses with varying construction types. In- 
formation on the state of burning and ﬁrebrand production were 
collected in the same manner. In total, 2357 ﬁrebrands were col- 
lected. 85% of the ﬁrebrands were less than 0.23 cm 2 in projected 
area. Only 14 ﬁrebrands had projected areas larger than 14.44 cm 2 
in three experiments. In both experimental series, ambient wind 
speeds  were  not  provided.  These  experiments  showed  that  ﬁre- 
brands with projected area of less than 0.23 cm 2 were signiﬁcant. 
Waterman [45] investigated ﬁrebrand generation from roof as- 
semblies with three different sheathings (2 in. thick ﬁr, 1 in. thick 
yellow pine and 5/16 inch thick plywood) and sidings (including 
no sidings applied, wood shingles, asphalt shingles, roll rooﬁng and 
cement-asbestos shingles), and pitch (inclination) as well as inside 
pressure  induced  by  applying  wind  from  underneath.  Firebrands 
were collected by meshes in water pools placed around the roof 
assemblies. Firebrands produced in this experimental series were 
in  the  glowing  state.  It  was  found  that  wood  shingles  produced 
far more ﬁrebrands than any other material. It was also mentioned 
that wind induced pressure had the most effect on ﬁrebrand pro-

ﬁrebrands collected in this burn had a mass of less than 1 g and 
the projected area of most of ﬁrebrands were less than 10 cm 2 . The 
effect of ﬁre suppression, as water was applied by ﬁreﬁghters dur- 
ing the burn, was not known, but could have inﬂuenced results. As 
compared to the data of Vodvorka [43] , ﬁrebrand projected areas 
were generally larger. This may be due to the difference of mate- 
rials as well as the collection methods used (sheets versus water 
pans). 

Subsequently,  an  experiment  with  a  simpler  full-scale  struc- 
ture was conducted in BRI’s FRWTF [49] . This structure was made 
simply  from  OSB  and  wood  studs  with  the  dimensions  of  3  m 
(W) x 4 m (L) x 4 m (H). Mass loss of the structure was also mea- 
sured during the burn and the peak ﬁre intensity was estimated to 
be 1.76 MW/m 2 . The applied wind speed was 6 m/s, which was se- 
lected to be similar to the wind speed in the previous, more com- 
plex real-scale structure burn experiment [48] . More than 90% of 
ﬁrebrands weighed less than 1 g and had less than 10 cm 2  pro- 
jected  area.  Comparison  with  the  ﬁrebrands  from  the  real-scale 
structure in [48] showed that the ﬁrebrands from this study were 
slightly heavier in mass, at a given projected area. Materials used 
for the structure burned in this study were OSB/wood studs with 
no siding applied while the structure that was burned in Dixon, 
CA [48] was ﬁtted with wood siding, tar paper, and plywood. It 
was suggested that this variety of materials in the structure might 
be responsible for lighter ﬁrebrands. 

As a further simpliﬁcation, full-scale building component com- 
bustion experiments were also performed with wall assemblies as 
well as rooﬁng assemblies [50–52] . A repeatable ignition method 
was developed. After the assembly was placed, a ﬂame was ap- 
plied  by  using  a  30  kW  T-shaped  burner  for  10  min.  The  igni- 
tion source was applied without wind in order to ensure the same 
amount of heat for ignition. Once the assembly was ignited, the 
burner was tuned off, and then the wind at 6 m/s or 8 m/s was ap- 
plied. This method produced a similar size and mass of ﬁrebrands 
in repeated experiments. First this method was used to the wall 
assemblies [50] and then rooﬁng assemblies [51] . Firebrands from 
simple  wall  (re-entrant  corner)  assemblies,  made  from  OSB  and 
wooden studs, under different wind speeds were investigated and 
the ﬁrebrands under 8 m/s (higher wind speed used) had larger 
projected areas than under 6 m/s winds [50] . Nonetheless, most 
of the ﬁrebrands collected in this study also had less than 1 g in 
mass and 10 cm 2 projected area. For the rooﬁng assemblies made 
from simple OSB and wooden studs, a similar experiment was per- 
formed using the same method [51] . A signiﬁcant number of ﬁre- 
brands  were  found  to  be  within  the  same  range  as  those  from 
the wall assemblies. Rooﬁng assemblies produced the larger num- 
ber of ﬁrebrands between 0 cm 2 and 0.9 cm 2 projected area. Com- 
pared with the wall assembly, where higher wind speeds produced 
larger ﬁrebrands, the roof assemblies produced larger ﬁrebrands at 
lower wind speeds. The peak of the projected areas for both as- 
semblies was 0–0.9 cm 2 , yet a larger number of ﬁrebrands were 
obtained for 8 m/s rather than 6 m/s, reducing the ratio between 
mass and projected area more sharply than 6 m/s. Average pro- 
jected area and mass were compared with rooﬁng assembly the

combustion experiment [53] . (all under a 6 m/s wind condition). 

smallest, then Itoigawa-City Fire data [10] , then wall assembly data. 
Despite a change in scale and conﬁgurations, the ﬁrebrand data in 
these experiments matched data from real events well. This same 
experimental method was applied to investigate ﬁrebrand produc- 
tion from cedar shingle sidings on wall assemblies [52] . These ﬁre- 
brands had a larger projected area than those from OSB. Firebrands 
made from tar paper, part of the assembly, were also collected and 
had a lighter mass than other ﬁrebrands collected. The peaks of 
the size distributions of ﬁrebrands collected from the wall assem- 
blies with cedar siding shifted to the smaller size compared with 
the ones with no siding. 

Finally, the wind effect on ﬁrebrand generation from building 
components was investigated carefully at the bench-scale [53] . This 
bench-scale  experimental  method  was  newly  developed  with  an 
aim to produce ﬁrebrands similar to those from full-scale build- 
ing components. The comparison of ﬁrebrand data from a series of 
experiments under the same wind speed, 6 m/s, is shown in Fig. 8 . 
The same ignition method as described earlier (a T-shaped burner) 
was applied, but for shorter ignition time (5 min compared with 
10 min). The mock-up assemblies were half the length and half the 
width of the full-scale experiments. The small-scale study showed 
that the projected area of ﬁrebrands, A 
proj has a linear relationship 
with their mass: 

m F = ρF d A pro j 

(13)

where  d  is  an  approximate  thickness  of  the  ﬁrebrand  and  ρF 
their density. Assuming ﬁrebrands had the same density, they con- 
cluded that the thickness of ﬁrebrands was affected by the wind 
speed,  as  the  higher  wind  speed  meant  a  stronger  wind  force 
which would result in higher stresses capable of fracturing larger- 
thickness  components.  This  relationship  was  compared  with  the 
literature [ 49 , 50 ], and the trend was similar. 

Clearly, ﬁrebrands are produced when structures are combust- 
ing.  Their  nature  is  not  yet  fully  known;  however,  it  has  been 
shown that these ﬁrebrands can be generated at multiple scales, 
even in the laboratory. While the ﬁre plume and wind are believed 
to be major factors in ﬁrebrand production, observations of an in- 
creased rate of ﬁrebrand production during structural collapse and 
ﬁreﬁghting operations point to other effects that, as of yet, are not 
well documented. A key feature missing from nearly all the ﬁre- 
brand generation experimental studies is quantiﬁcation of the heat 
release rate of the various building components and actual struc- 
tures. While this is very diﬃcult to obtain such information exper- 
imentally, more efforts are needed here. 

4. Detailed review on current knowledge for ﬁrebrand 
transport processes 

After  ﬁrebrands  are  generated,  they  are  lofted  by  the  ﬁre 
plume  and/or  transported  by  ambient  winds.  Plume  correlations 
or CFD simulations for axisymmetric and line ﬁres [54–61] can be 
used in conjunction with drag coeﬃcients to determine the loft- 
ing  (vertical)  force  applied  to  a  ﬁrebrand.  The  lateral  (horizon- 
tal) force components are determined in a similar way based on 
the wind’s velocity proﬁle. These calculations, however, require in- 
formation about the plume characteristics, wind proﬁle, and ﬁre- 
brand thermo-chemical properties variations [15] . Pioneering work 
in this aspect of the problem was conducted by Tarifa et al. [ 54 , 62 ] 
that experimentally determined drag and burning rates of spheres, 
cylinders,  and  plates  of  various  woods.  A  key  conclusion  of  this 
work was that ﬁrebrands could be assumed to fall at their termi- 
nal velocity, as this was reached quickly in comparison to the par- 
ticle’s longer burning time. This work was later extended by Lee 
and Hellman [63] , Muraszew et al. [64] , and Albini [65–67] , who 
considered lofting of ﬁrebrands by line thermals and ﬁre plumes 
and  provided  methods  for  simulating  their  transport  and  burn- 
ing rate, ultimately resulting in practical models for the maximum 
distance a ﬁrebrand could spot. These early works have been fol- 
lowed by several theoretical and experimental studies of the trans- 
port of ﬁrebrands addressing different aspects of the problem [68–
74] .  These  researchers  applied  different  models  of  a  buoyancy- 
dominated plume to calculate lofting and subsequent wind trans- 
port of ﬁrebrands of different shapes (spheres, cylinders, disks). Hi- 
moto and Tanaka [70] , Koo et al. [71] , Kortas et al. [75] , and Sar- 
doy et al. [73,74] , studied the transport of ﬁrebrands using differ- 
ent CFD models to predict the plume characteristics and ﬁrebrand 
transport. A model for ﬁrebrand lofting and transport has been in- 
cluded in the CFD model FIRETEC [72] by Koo et al. [71] . FIRETEC 
is a physics-based wildand ﬁre model [72] 

Another far less cited and well-known approach involved calcu- 
lating concentration distributions of aerosols (pollutants) under the 
assumption that ﬁrebrands are small enough to be considered such 
types of pollutants [76] . Kamei also investigated several ﬁres and 
plotted the number of spot ﬁres versus distance and wind speeds 
[77] . Yet another important but less studied aspect of the transport 
has been the accumulation of ﬁrebrands near obstacles, which has 
been  only  recently  studied  experimentally  [78] .  There  have  also 
been studies examining ﬁrebrands and measurements such as ﬁre- 
brand ﬂux (ﬁrebrands per unit area time) from a controlled burn 
ﬁre [37] . 

4.1. Firebrand trajectories 

Calculating  the  trajectories  of  the  ﬁrebrands  follows  directly 
from application of Newton’s laws of motion [15] . The formulation 
of the problem follows the well-established ballistic equations with 
the added complexity that the ﬁrebrands maybe burning and con- 
sequently that the temperature, size, and mass of the ﬁrebrands 
may change in time. Fig. 2 presents a schematic of the coordinate 
system used and the forces considered in the formulation of the 
problem. 

Assuming  that  the  ﬁrebrand  mass  ablates  uniformly  from  its 
surface so that net forces due to mass change sum to zero, and 
that the ﬁrebrand density is large compared to the surrounding at- 
mosphere so that buoyancy forces may be neglected, the Newto- 
nian equations of motion for a ﬁrebrand in vector form are [15] :

have only a horizontal component, does possess a vertical distri- 
bution, which is dependent on the type of terrain. A 
proj is the pro- 
jected area of the ﬁrebrand and C D is the drag coeﬃcient, which is 
a function of both the Reynolds number and the geometric shape 
of the ﬁrebrands. Fluid properties are taken at atmospheric pres- 
sure and average ﬁlm temperature of the ambient ﬂuid and the 
ﬁrebrand surface temperature. While the bulk ﬂow ﬁeld is likely 
turbulent, the turbulent scale is assumed to be much larger than 
the ﬁrebrand size, so that the ﬂuidic forces on the ﬁrebrand are 
considered to be within the laminar regime. The solution to the 
above equations with the corresponding boundary conditions de- 
scribes the ﬁrebrand trajectory. 

Although the problem looks straightforward, there are several 
issues  that  complicate  its  solution  [15] .  The  primary  one  is  the 
modeling of the ﬁrebrand burning process because its diameter d p 
and mass m p  are functions of the burning rate and consequently 
time. The time dependent variation of the ﬁrebrand mass and di- 
ameter affects the gravity and drag forces and through them the 
trajectory.  The  woody  material  of  the  ﬁrebrand  may  burn  as  a 
gas  ﬂame  or  through  a  heterogeneous  surface  combustion  reac- 
tion (glowing smolder) of the wood. Both forms of combustion are 
maintained by the heat released by the reaction. However, as the 
reaction  progresses  the  ﬁrebrand  will  char  forming  a  char  layer 
surrounding the ﬁrebrand that grows with time. The char may pre- 
vent the transport of heat to its interior preventing the release of 
pyrolyzates and the formation of the gas ﬂame limiting the com- 
bustion to the glowing surface reaction. It also may hinder the dif- 
fusion of oxygen to its interior preventing further burning of the 
ﬁrebrand. In addition, if there is a relative velocity between the 
ﬁrebrand and the wind, the char layer may be stripped by shear 
forces which would enhance the smolder reaction of the ﬁrebrand. 
Furthermore, either ﬂaming or smoldering can be hindered if the 
ﬁrebrand  is  in  the  ﬁre  plume  where  oxygen  concentrations  are

well established and heights are not included. Rotation of the el- 
ements in the air was also deemed an important consideration. A 
recent experimental study by Song et al. [61] studied a somewhat 
similar conﬁguration with smoldering disc-shaped ﬁrebrands. Their 
results showed a bimodal distribution of landing, similar to Sardoy 
et al. [73,74] , and developed correlations for this local landing dis- 
tance. 

A less cited approach was to calculate the concentration distri- 
bution of aerosols under the assumption that ﬁrebrands may be 
considered  as  pollutants  (aerosols)  [76] .  Adapting  Sutton’s  equa- 
tion  on  aerosol  distributions,  the  concentration  distribution  was 
obtained on the ground level. This approach does not consider the 
ﬁrebrand size, or combustion of ﬁrebrands. Kamei investigated ur- 
ban ﬁres by considering the number of spot ﬁres and their dis- 
tance from ﬁre origination. Two ranges of wind speeds were con- 
sidered; less than 15.0 m/s or 54 km/h (group A) or above 15.0 m/s 
or 54 km/h (group B). With wind speed higher than 15.0 m/s, most 
of the spot ﬁres are observed within 100 m from the ﬁre source. 
The number of spot ﬁres decreases as the distance increases. If the 
wind speed was less than 15.0 m/s, namely, 6.0 m/s (or 22 km/h) 
to 15. 0 m/s, most of the spot ﬁres were observed from 100 m to 
600 m from the ﬁre source [77] . 

An  enhanced  scenario  for  ﬁrebrand  generation  may  occur 
within ﬁre whirls, whose strong circulation induces larger radial 
and vertical velocities that could enhance both fracture and loft- 
ing of ﬁrebrands [85] . Muraszew et al. [64] analyzed the trajectory 
of ﬁrebrands lofted within a ﬁre whirl and performed some pre- 
liminary experiments, showing potential enhancement in vertical 
lofting. Still, further research is needed on the topic, including the 
effects of higher ﬁre intensities and velocities on the generation of 
additional material and further study of potential lofting distances. 
A connecting element between transport of ﬁrebrands and ig- 
nition  of  a  fuel  bed  is  deposition  of  the  ﬁrebrands  onto  a  fuel 
bed. While there are numerous studies which look at whether ﬁre- 
brands generated from a ﬁre can travel a speciﬁc distance, the con- 
nection between this distance and how these land and attach to 
a surface has not yet been modeled in detail. Experiments have 
shown locations where ﬁrebrands are often deposited, especially 
in  controlled  studies,  such  as  those  with  the  NIST  Dragon  [13] , 
however more detailed physical insight will be required before this 
problem can be completely modeled. 

5. Detailed review on current knowledge for ignition induced 
by ﬁrebrands 

5.1. Ignition of wildland fuels 

Ignition induced by ﬁrebrands, similar to ﬁrebrand generation, 
is much less understood as compared to ﬁrebrand transport pro- 
cesses.  Wildland  fuels  have  a  morphology  that  is  very  different 
from  that  of  a  continuous  solid.  Typically,  surface  fuels  consist 
of ﬁne, solid pieces of biomass, arranged to form a heterogenous 
porous  material.  The  morphology  of  the  fuel  could  vary  from  a 
powder  and  very  thin  pieces  (e.g.  duff,  grass,  etc.),  to  relatively 
large pieces of woody material (e.g. needles, twigs and branches). 
The state of the fuel can also change, from moist to dry and live 
to dead. Consequently, the ignition characteristics of these fuels is 
complex and presents challenges. Furthermore, the porous charac- 
ter of surface fuels allows for the direct onset of smoldering ig- 
nition. Thus, the ignition of these fuels is a highly complex pro- 
cess that depends on the size and state of the ﬁrebrand (smolder- 
ing/glowing, ﬂaming), characteristics of the fuel bed on which it 
lands (temperature, density, porosity, moisture content), and envi- 
ronmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind velocity). 

In the ignition of wildland fuels, ﬁne fuels such as grass, leaves, 
needles,  mulch,  and  compost  are  typically  the  easiest  and  most

low. Modeling of these burning processes is diﬃcult and compli- 
cates  the  accurate  prediction  of  the  ﬁrebrand  trajectory.  An  ap- 
proach is to use experimental data to develop empirical correla- 
tions of the variation with time of the ﬁrebrand diameter and mass 
as it was done in [68,73,79] , where the experiments of Tarifa et al. 
[54,62] , were used to develop an effective regression rate equation 
for spherical ﬁrebrands by ﬁtting the data with a diameter to the 
fourth power law:

√ 

where  the  burning  constant  Ɵ is  obtained  ﬁtting  to  the  data  in 
[54] . Following a similar approach Anthenien et al. [79] developed 
burning rate expressions for cylinders (twigs) and very thin disks 
(leaves). Although these studies provide a ﬁrst step in the mod- 
elling of ﬁrebrand burning, there is still a need for a more accurate 
ﬁrebrand burning characterization that would provide information 
about the transient effects in the burning process and surface tem- 
perature as char builds-up, the effect of the type of wood on the 
burning rate, and so on. 

A  characteristic  example  of  a  ﬁrebrand  trajectory  is  given  in 
Fig. 9 for cylinders in a buoyant plume from a 40 MW ﬁre in a 
48 km/h crosswind [79] . Simulation results for charring cylinders 
with extinction by a char layer and burnout with no char formed 
are shown in the ﬁgure. It is seen that large ﬁrebrands land on the 
ground closer to their initiation location, and that small ﬁrebrands 
may burn before landing. Simulations by Sardoy et al. [73,74] , in- 
cluded both a ﬂaming and smoldering combustion model, which 
resulted in a similar dual-distribution of ﬁrebrands. Larger, ﬂam- 
ing  ﬁrebrands  land  near  the  ﬁre  front,  and  a  wider  distribution 
of smaller, smoldering ﬁrebrands land further downstream [73,74] . 
Simulations by Kortas et al. [75] have also been used to charac- 
terize the mass and spatial distributions of ﬁrebrands lofted in an 
experimental wind tunnel from the ﬁrebrand generator known as 
the NIST Dragon [80] . 

More recent studies by Tohidi et al. have mostly investigated 
non-combusting brands both experimentally [81] and numerically 
[82,83] ,  examining  their  transport  through  a  three-dimensional 
wind  ﬁeld  generated  by  a  highly  resolved  CFD  simulation.  Their 
probabilistic approach to the problem is a useful framework, and 
through  their  adoption  of  Richards  [84]  fully  deterministic,  3D 
6 degree-of-freedom model, the rotation of rod-like ﬁrebrands is 
incorporated  and  examined  using  Monte-Carlo  studies.  Eventual 
transport of ﬁrebrands is shown to be sensitive to the initial con- 
ditions of the ﬁrebrand, especially the height from which they are 
released, concluding that lofting and downwind transport cannot 
be decoupled. This is an issue as generation algorithms are not yet

common  type  of  fuel  ignited  by  ﬁrebrands.  The  large  void  frac- 
tion  of  these  fuels  allows the  top  layer to  ignite  and  burn  with 
suﬃcient  oxygen  availability, while thermally  insulating the  bot- 
tom of the burning layer due to the low thermal conductivity of 
the biomass and air. Because of the low thermal conductivity, the 
fuel beds have large Biot numbers, ( Bi >  0.1), and they would be 
considered to be thermally thick following the deﬁnition that the 
heated layer would be smaller than the fuel thickness. However, 
on a hot day, when heated by the air or solar radiation, only a rel- 
atively thin outer layer of the fuel would be heated up, and the 
fuel would behave as a thin fuel in some aspects of the thermal 
problem. The fuels in this layer would reach their pyrolysis tem- 
perature much faster than if they were non-porous, while the rest 
of the fuel underneath the layer would heat up more slowly. Thus, 
although the wildland fuel bed would, theoretically, be thermally 
thick, in practice it would behave as thermally thin ( Bi < 0.1), in 
the sense that only a thin surface layer of the fuel bed would heat 
up. How fast it would heat up would depend on the heating source 
and the morphological characteristics of the fuel bed. In addition to 
the complexity that the fuel bed morphology brings, wildland fu- 
els contain moisture, so the heating and evaporation of the mois- 
ture complicates the ignition induced by ﬁrebrand processes fur- 
ther.  This  moisture  is  primarily  water,  especially  in  the  case  of 
dead biomass fuels, although recent studies have shown that the 
drying behavior can be more complex with live fuels [1] . 

5.2. Ignition of structural fuels 

In  WUI  ﬁres,  urban  ﬁres  and  informal  settlement  ﬁres,  man- 
made  structures  can  also  be  ignited  by  ﬁrebrands.  The  develop- 
ment of the NIST ﬁrebrand generators has led to advancement in 
this  topical  area  [13] .  A  review  by  Caton  et  al.  [14]  provides  an 
overview of several components of structures that have been iden- 
tiﬁed as vulnerabilities from ﬁrebrand spotting; the review high- 
lights  insights  obtained  from  the  USA  [13] .  A  review  by  Suzuki 
[16] describes studies on vulnerabilities related to Japanese con- 
struction in urban ﬁres. Speciﬁcally mentioned are: rooﬁng, gut- 
ters, eaves, vents, siding, windows, glazing, decks, porches, patios, 
fences, mulches and debris. These vulnerable components them- 
selves can serve as the fuel itself, but they can serve as a place for 
ﬁne fuels to collect, such as leaf or pine litter from nearby trees. 
These  ﬁne  fuels  tend  to  collect  in  crevices  along  the  structures, 
such  as  areas  of  roofs,  patios,  decks,  and  gutters,  easily  igniting 
once ﬁrebrands land on a dry windy day. These building features 
can also provide a path for ﬁrebrands to enter the interior of the 
home, e.g. vents and open windows. Thus, the fuels that can be ig- 
nited by ﬁrebrands in structures are much more diverse than nat- 
ural wildland fuels, encompassing synthetic fuels used in rooﬁng 
or siding and minimally-processed biomass-derived fuels such as 
decking. These fuels also span the range from very ﬁne fuels (pine 
and leaf litter) to larger wood components (decking). Large wood 
components have low porosity (small void fraction) and typically 
require more heat to ignite. Consequently, these larger materials 
require more signiﬁcant ﬂame interactions and/or accumulation of 
ﬁrebrands to overcome the demand imposed by the larger energy 
requirements. 

5.3. Individual ignition induced by ﬁrebrands – studies in the 
laboratory 

Several studies have examined the ability of single or multiple 
ﬁrebrands to ignite fuels while changing parameters related to the 
ﬁrebrand, fuel, and ambient conditions. Manzello and co-workers 
[86–89]  studied  the  ability  of  ﬁrebrands,  in  either  a  ﬂaming  or 
glowing state, to ignite vegetative fuel beds (pine straw, hardwood 
mulch, and cut grass) at two moisture content (MC) values and two 

wind speed levels [86,87] . It was found that although possible, it 
is unlikely for glowing ﬁrebrands to ignite the fuels tested even 
when they were very dry [86,87] . Flaming ﬁrebrands were capable 
of igniting the ﬁner fuels, when the fuel had a MC of 11%, but ig- 
nition was not observed for hardwood mulch and observed half of 
the time for the cut grass [87] . Similar experiments were done for 
the spot ignition of crevices in various wood-based construction 
materials [89] . 

One aspect of the ignition of a fuel bed by ﬁrebrands that has 
not been studied much is the potential of a smolder ignition of the 
fuel bed instead of a ﬂaming ignition. It is possible for ﬁrebrands 
to  ignite  a  smolder  that  would  propagate  and  eventually  transi- 
tion into ﬂaming. This is actually a very likely mode of ignition by 
glowing ﬁrebrands if the fuel and ambient conditions are appro- 
priate. Furthermore, the limiting conditions for ignition are differ- 
ent for smolder than for ﬂaming. In a related work, Urban et al. 
[90] studied the ignition propensity of low moisture crashed dry 
grass by hot steel particles and showed that smolder ignition could 
be achieved at lower particle temperatures and sizes than ﬂaming 
ignition. Although this indicates that smolder ignition is easier to 
achieve in terms of the energy requirements of the ﬁrebrand, the 
low  intensity  of  the  smolder  reaction makes  it  very  sensitive to 
heat loses to the surrounding fuel and ambient, and consequently 
more diﬃcult to self-sustain than a ﬂaming ﬁre. This, together with 
the narrow conditions that cause the transition from smolder to 
ﬂaming make these type of studies diﬃcult to conduct. 

In  work  at  the  National  Research  Institute  of  Fire  and  Disas- 
ter  (NRIFD)  in  Japan  [91] ,  ﬁrebrands  were  produced  by  igniting 
wood cubes (Japanese Cypress) using a hot plate (500 °C) and then 
extinguishing the ﬂame, keeping them in glowing state. The rea- 
son  to  use  a  hot  plate  was  to  provide  consistent  initial  heating 
to  the  cubes.  Firebrands  were  deposited  on  fuel  beds  placed  in 
front of the fan. Five different sizes of ﬁrebrands, 5 mm, 8 mm, 
12 mm, 15 mm, and 30 mm were used for this experimental se- 
ries. The fuel beds were leaves of Japanese Larch, Sawtooth Oak, 
and Japanese cedar. The inﬂuence of wind speed, MC, and fuel bed 
density was investigated. The MC as well as the wind speed had 
effect on the minimum ﬁrebrand size which could cause ignition 
under the same density. The degree of the effects depended on the 
fuel beds, Japanese Larch being the easiest to be ignited. 

In  another  study  by  Hayashi  [92] ,  after  the  3-story  wooden 
school  burn  experiment,  it  was  observed  that  ﬁrebrands  caused 
ignitions  on  bamboo  leaves  so  experiments  with  bamboo  leaves 
were performed. 1 cm or 2 cm wood cubes were heated in a cone 
calorimeter  and  placed  on  or  in  the  bamboo  leaves.  The  MC  of 
bamboo leaves was also changed, and two wind speeds, no wind 
and 1 m/s wind, were tested to investigate the ignition as well as 
ﬂame spreads. With no wind applied it was diﬃcult to ignite fuel 
beds with 4.3% MC with 1 cm cubic ﬁrebrands, and with wind ap- 
plied ignition was observed. When ﬁrebrands were placed on top 
the fuel bed with wind, ignition was observed at MC up to 60%, 
but no ﬂame spread. When ﬁrebrands are placed inside the fuel 
beds, ignition was observed at MC 80%, and ﬂame spread was ob- 
served up to 35% MC. 

Additional  laboratory  experiments  have  been  also  conducted 
attempting  to  understand  the  basic  mechanisms  of  the  ignition 
of  natural  fuel  beds  by  ﬁrebrands  [93,94] .  In  those  experiments 
wooden  cylinders  of  different  sizes  were  ignited  to  ﬂaming  or 
glowing  and  dropped  on  a  fuel  bed  of  cellulose  or  saw  dust  to 
observe the necessary conditions for a ﬁrebrand to ignite a prop- 
agating  smolder  or  ﬂaming  ﬁre.  The  work  resulted  primarily  in 
qualitative  information  about  the  smoldering  or  ﬂaming  ignition 
of cellulose fuel beds. In an extension of that work Urban et al. 
[95] conducted  experiments on the effect of the MC of the fuel 
on the smoldering ignition of sawdust by ﬁrebrands. The MC lim- 
iting boundary, which for a given size ﬁrebrand represents a 50%

chance of smoldering ignition of the sawdust, was determined by 
performing a logistic regression on the experimental results. They 
show that larger ﬁrebrands are capable of igniting sawdust with 
MC up to 40%, although with very low probability, which is rea- 
sonable since they have a larger energy content to evaporate the 
water contained in the fuel. When the ﬁrebrand is suﬃciently large 
( > 9 . 5  mm),  the  dominant  process  governing  ignition  is  whether 
the target fuel’s combustion releases more heat than the energy 
required to dry the water in the fuel and raise the temperature of 
the fuel to the temperature at which smoldering reactions will oc- 
cur. The MC ignition boundary then decreased as the ﬁrebrand size 
decreased. It was found ﬁrebrands smaller than 4 mm were unable 
to ignite a fuel smolder with a moisture content below 1%. 

An important parameter controlling spot ﬁre ignition by ﬁre- 
brands  in  all  of  these  studies  was  the  MC  of  the  fuel  bed.  The 
importance resides in the fact that the ﬁrebrand must evaporate 
the water in the fuel before the fuel can be ignited by the ﬁre- 
brand, and consequently must have enough energy to ﬁrst evapo- 
rate the water, and subsequently pyrolyze the fuel and ignite the 
pyrolyzate [96] . The fuel moisture content also affects the net heat 
released from vegetative fuels, and consequently the sustainment 
of the fuel bed burning. [97] . Statistical experiments of the effect 
of MC on the likelihood of smoldering ignition of wildland fuels 
has been used to evaluate the ignition hazard of wildland fuels by 
ﬁrebrands of several sizes [98] . 

Recent  work  by  Hakes  et  al.  [99]  isolated  heating  from  piles 
of cylindrical ﬁrebrands, comparing ignition over real fuels to heat 
ﬂuxes received by inert, instrumented surface. Tests over an inert 
sensor  array showed  that  peak and total heating increased with 
the mass of a deposited pile of ﬁrebrands; however, these were not 
sensitive to diameter and tended to plateau at higher masses, al- 
though a larger area was heated. A comparison of ambient tests, 
which  reached  a  peak  heat  ﬂux  of  ∼10  kW/m 2 ,  showed  a  dra- 
matic difference with tests when a 1.84 m/s wind applied, where 
heat ﬂuxes peaked over 25 kW/m 2 , although tests with the same 
mass  of  ﬁrebrands  decreased  in  heating  duration  due  to  faster 
burnout of ﬁrebrands. Further quantitative study with wind was 
recommended, especially understanding the mechanisms of heat- 
ing, namely the proportion of radiation vs. conduction and contact. 

5.4. Ignition theories 

Very few analytical or modeling studies have been conducted 
on  the  ignition  of  wildland  or  structural  fuels  by  ﬁrebrands  or 
by hot particles. One challenge necessary to model ignition from 
ﬁrebrands  is  characterization  of  the  transition  between  smolder- 
ing combustion to ﬂaming combustion when fuels are ignited by 
glowing ﬁrebrands. More work has been conducted related to ig- 
nition theories for hot non-reacting particles. While this is a far 
simpler  problem  than  ignition  induced  by  ﬁrebrands,  these  the- 
ories are reviewed here for completeness. It has been suggested 
that the energy content of a particle can be used as an ignition 
criterion, analogous to the minimum ignition energy concept for 
gases. Essentially, if the energy content of a particle is greater than 
a particular threshold, then ignition occurs. However, this criterion 
is insuﬃcient because it has been shown experimentally that dif- 
ferent size particles with the same energy do not necessarily re- 
sult  in  ignition  [15] .  On  the  other  hand,  the  ‘‘hot  spot’’  ignition 
theory [100,101] appears to provide a reasonable and simple ap- 
proach for the prediction of particle size-temperature relationships 
for  ignition.  Hot  spot  theory  was  originally  developed  to  model 
the  ignition  of  gases  by  hot  particles  [100,101]  and  the  ignition 
of a condense explosives [102] . Later on Jones [103–105] applied 
hot spot theory developed by Gol’dshleger et al. [102] to simulate 
the ignition of forest litter by copper particles. The application of 
this theory was also recommended by Bowes [106] for its com-

promise  between  accuracy  and  tractability  and  was  also  applied 
by Babrauskas [29] to correlate barley grass ignition by aluminum 
particles [107] . Hadden et al. [108] applied the hot spot theory to 
correlate their experiments on the ignition of a cellulose fuel bed 
by hot steel particles and found that although the theory was in 
qualitatively agreement with the experimental observations it was 
not capable of providing quantitative results. Several recent stud- 
ies have also been conducted that are critical to advance under- 
standing of hot metal particle ignition [109–111] . Here we describe 
brieﬂy the theory since it has a potential application to the predic- 
tion of wildland fuel ignition by ﬁrebrands. 

The  governing  equations  for  a  non-reactive  hot  spot  parti- 
cle/ﬁrebrand (subscript p ) completely embedded in an inﬁnite fuel 
bed are as follows: 
for 0 < x < r :  ρp c p

where ρ is the density, c p  is the speciﬁc heat capacity, T is the 
temperature,  t  is  time,  a  is  the  surface  area,  V  is  the  volume,  k 
is the thermal conductivity, A is the pre-exponential factor, (cid:13)H is 
the heat of combustion, E is the activation energy, and R is the 
universal gas constant. 

In formulating the energy equation for the particle, Eq. (18) , it 
has  been  assumed  that  the  particle  temperature  is  uniform  and 
that the particle is in good thermal contact with the surrounding 
fuel bed so that the rate of heat transfer from the particle is a p k ∇T 
where a p is the particle surface area. 

The initial conditions for Eq. (18) are: 

for 0 < x < r T p | 
and for Eq. (19) :

Eqs. (18) and (19) cannot be solved analytically and require nu- 
merical solution. Of primary interest is the value of the particle ra- 
dius at which thermal runaway (ignition) occurs. Gol’dshleger et al. 
[102] conducted numerical simulations to determine the value of 
the critical radius for ignition ( δcr ) and found that the following 
curve-ﬁt matched their numerical results within 10%: 
(cid:3)

( 2 . 25 ( n − 1 ) − θ0 ) 2 ( 1 − 0 . 5 βθ0 ) 

(cid:4)

δcr ≈ 0 . 4 

(cid:20) 

(20) 
where δcr is the Frank-Kamenetskii hot spot parameter; b the vol- 
umetric heat capacity ratio; and β, the dimensionless inverse par- 
ticle temperature are deﬁned as follows:

Once δcr is calculated from Eq. (20) the critical hot spot radius 
r cr ( i.e. , the minimum particle radius for ignition) can be calculated 
from the deﬁnition of δ ( Eq. 21 ) as: 
(cid:15)

Eq. (24) predicts qualitatively the experimental observations of 
[107,108] that the critical particle size for ignition of a natural fuel 
bed increases as the temperature of the particle decreases.

Given  the  simpliﬁed  character  of  the  hot  spot  theory  several 
numerical  models  of  differing  degree  of  accuracy  have  been de- 
veloped  to  simulate  more  accurately  the  ignition  of  a  wildland 
fuel bed by a hot particle or ﬁrebrand. Zvyagils’kaya and Subbotin 
[112] ,  Grishin  et  al.  [113] ,  and  Matvienko  et  al.  [114]  developed 
numerical models that considered a porous condensed-phase that 
represented  natural  vegetation.  However,  the  models  do  not  in- 
clude a porous condensed-phase model (to simulate the fuel bed) 
coupled to a gas-phase code (to simulate the exterior “ambient”). 
This coupled approach is required to properly simulate the igni- 
tion mechanisms of a fuel bed by a ﬁrebrand. To provide a more 
accurate insight into the spot ﬁre ignition problem Lautenberger 
and Fernandez-Pello [115] developed a 2-D coupled gas/solid anal- 
ysis of the ignition induced by a ﬁrebrand. The model consists of a 
computational ﬂuid dynamics representation of the gas-phase us- 
ing Fire Dynamic Simulations (FDS) [116] coupled to a heat transfer 
and pyrolysis model, G-Pyro [117] that simulates condensed-phase 
phenomena. The coupled model is used to simulate ignition of a 
powdered cellulose porous fuel bed by glowing ﬁrebrands made 
from pine in a laboratory experiment. The model provides qual- 
itative information regarding the mechanisms leading to ignition, 
smolder, or ﬂame propagation on porous fuel bed that agree qual- 
itatively with experimental observations. The model provides the 
foundation for a more complete study of the problem where the 
effects of different factors (moisture content, humidity, tempera- 
ture, porosity, particle size/heat content, etc.) are quantiﬁed. An- 
other notable numerical model of the ignition induced by ﬁrebrand 
problem is that of Matvienko et al. [114] . The model is a 3-D nu- 
merical  model  that  considers  the  exchange  of  heat  between  the 
fuel bed and the surrounding air, and the evaporation of moisture 
from the fuel. The objective of the model is to determine the tem- 
peratures and concentration of components for fuel-bed and gas- 
phase ignition. The model predictions for the limiting conditions 
for ignition agree well with experiments conducted to verify the 
model.

Yin et al. [118] formulated a scaling analysis based on a simple 
thermal  conservation  equation,  proposing  a  correlation  between 
the ignition time of a loose vegetative fuel bed: 
(cid:22) 
( ρF k ) / c p 
b − h T ( T F − T 0 )

where t 
ig is the time to ignition after ﬁrebrand deposition, q is the 
heat  required  for  ignition  of  moist  fuel  on  a  dry-mass  basis, ρF 
the initial density of the ﬁrebrand, k , ρ,  and c p the thermal con- 
ductivity, density and speciﬁc heat of dry pine needles in the bed, 
respectively, Z the height of the ﬁrebrand, (cid:13)H c  the heat of com- 
bustion of the ﬁrebrand in a glowing phase of combustion, h T the 
heat loss coeﬃcient, T F the ﬁrebrand temperature, and T 
0 the ini- 
tial temperature of the target fuel bed [118] . A linear relationship 
(cid:22) 
is seen between 
ig and q, which corresponds with the slope ob- 
t 
served in experiments on Chinese lodge pole pine [119,120] ; how- 
ever, the comparison is not quantitative. 

5.5. Experimentally simulating ﬁrebrand showers 

A  major  challenge  related  to  ﬁrebrand  transport  and  ignition 
understanding is related to the showers of ﬁrebrands that are gen- 
erated in actual large outdoor ﬁres. While studying the fundamen- 
tal ignition processes of individual ﬁrebrands is important, these 
studies are not able to quantify the vulnerabilities of structures to 
ignition  from  ﬁrebrand  showers  or  elucidate  the  physics  of  ﬁre- 
brand transport. To accomplish this requires measurement meth- 
ods  that  are  capable  to  replicate  wind-driven  ﬁrebrand  showers 
that occur in actual large outdoor ﬁre events. To address this prob- 
lem,  the  NIST  Firebrand  Generator  was  constructed  to  generate 
controlled,  repeatable  ﬁrebrand  showers  commensurate  to  those 

measured from actual large outdoor ﬁres [80] and then modiﬁed 
to produce the ﬁrebrand showers for continuous duration (see Fig. 
10 ). 

Both  full-scale  [121]  and  reduced-scale  versions  [122]  of  this 
experimental technology have been developed that are able to pro- 
duce a continuous ﬂow of ﬁrebrand showers. For completeness, the 
principles of operation for the full-scale continuous feed ﬁrebrand 
generator is described and the principles of operation are similar 
for the reduced-scale version of the apparatus. 

The  experimental  apparatus  consists  of  the  main  body  and 
the  continuous  feeding  component  (Dragon  component).  In  this 
experimental  apparatus,  airﬂow  required  for  ﬁrebrand  combus- 
tion/lofting was provided by a variable frequency drive blower that 
was coupled to the main body. The airﬂow speed was initially var- 
ied  to  determine  optimal  operating  conditions  for  glowing  ﬁre- 
brand  generation.  The  purpose  of  the  experimental  apparatus  is 
to simulate wind-driven ﬁrebrand showers observed in long-range 
spotting. As a result, glowing ﬁrebrands were the initial emphasis. 
Yet, due to careful design of the device, it is also possible to gen- 
erate showers of ﬂaming ﬁrebrands. 

The feeding system made use of a large air driven cylinder. A 
custom constructed receptacle was used to store the wood chips. 
Directly beneath the wood storage area, a custom metal plate was 
ﬁtted  that  allowed  changes  in  the  volume  of  wood  to  fall  from 
the storage receptacle to the ﬁrst gate. By adjusting this volume, 
the  amount  of  wood  chips  that  enter  the  main  body  (Dragon) 
for eventual combustion could be varied. When the air pressure 
was energized, the rod of the air cylinder slid forward and sep- 
arated  the  wood  pieces  from  the  storage  receptacle  to  the  ﬁrst 
gate,  where  they  were  then  deposited  towards  the  second  gate 
that led to the Dragon where they were ignited using a propane 
fueled  burner  that  was  kept  on  continuously  during  the  experi- 
ments. Since wind is an important component of large outdoor ﬁre 
spread, the full-scale version of the NIST Dragon is installed inside 
the BRI’s FRWTF. 

The  reduced-scale  continuous  feed  ﬁrebrand  generator  is  in- 
stalled  inside  the  NRIFD’s  wind  facility.  The  ﬂow  ﬁeld  is  much 
smaller than the BRI facility at 2 m by 2 m, so it is possible to 
conduct smaller scale experiments to observe the physics of ﬁre- 
brand transport and ignition. Differences in the full-scale behavior 
may be directly compared using this smaller sized facility. 

These collaborative effort s between NIST, BRI, and NRIFD have 
led to advances in the understanding of ﬁrebrand process in large 
outdoor  ﬁres.  As  some  examples,  Fig.  11  demonstrates  how  the 
full-scale ﬁrebrand generator may be used to investigate ﬁrebrand 
ﬂow  over  obstacles  on  realistic-scales.  Wind-driven  showers  of 
ﬁrebrands  have  been  used  to  investigate  the  ignition  of  whole 
building  components,  such  as  ceramic  rooﬁng  assemblies  [123–
132] . This is an important aspect of the ignition problem, as accu- 
mulated ‘piles’ of ﬁrebrands store signiﬁcantly more energy, pos- 
ing a much greater ignition hazard. In addition of studying the ef- 
fect of basic parameters, such as the characteristics of the ﬁrebrand 
and fuel bed, in the propensity of the ﬁrebrand to ignite the tar- 
get fuel, these studies address realistic scenarios such as the ig- 
nition  of  fences  and  decks  by  accumulation  of  ﬁrebrands.  These 
works conﬁrmed that ﬁrebrand showers and the accumulation of 
ﬁrebrands in deck crevices, fence corners, vertical walls and gar- 
den mulch, enhances the ability of the ﬁrebrands to ignite struc- 
tures. Manzello and co-workers [123–132] also studied the attack 
of siding and building components to ﬁrebrand showers and inves- 
tigated the vulnerabilities of the different components. An interest- 
ing ﬁnding is that ﬁrebrand showers can ignite mulch in re-entrant 
corners like those found in homes which in turn can ignite the sid- 
ing. 

Recent  experiments  have  used  the  reduced-scale  continuous 
feed ﬁrebrand generator to unravel the basic ignition dynamics of

thatched rooﬁng assemblies [132] . While it has been known that 
important cultural heritage sites that contain thatched rooﬁng as- 
semblies  are  prone  to  ignition,  it  has  not  been  possible  to  ex- 
perimentally explore the fundamental ignition mechanisms. In Fig. 
12 , a mock-up thatched rooﬁng assembly is exposed to ﬁrebrand 
showers characteristic of those produced from structure combus- 
tion using the reduced-scale ﬁrebrand generator in NRIFD. These 
experiments are useful to evaluate and develop effective counter 
measures to protect historical structures with thatched rooﬁng as- 
semblies, especially for historical buildings, such as the United Na- 
tions Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s 
world heritage sites in Japan.

6. Research needs 

Experiments, models, and simulations related to ﬁrebrand gen- 
eration, lofting, burning, transport, deposition and ignition of ma- 
terials were reviewed in the context of large outdoor ﬁres. Over the 
past several decades, the ﬁre safety science discipline has devel- 
oped a deep body of knowledge on ﬁre dynamics within buildings 
[133] . As opposed to traditional building ﬁres, there exists no vali- 
dated models to predict ﬁre spread and structure ignition in large 

16

outdoor ﬁres. As a result, the importance of ﬁrebrand processes is 
listed as a major global research focus by the International FORUM 
of Fire Research Directors [133] . While extensive progress has been 
made in ﬁrebrand research, some key areas that require further at- 
tention are delineated with an emphasis on areas where the fun- 
damental combustion research community may play a leading role. 

Well-controlled experiments on ﬁrebrand transport and deposi- 
tion under applied wind ﬁelds and different fuel bed morphologies 
are  required.  Basic  understanding  is  required  on  how  ﬁrebrands 
may deposit in the presence of various obstacles under wind. 

New  experimental  methodologies,  based  on  state  of  the  art 
imaging techniques, to characterize the ﬁrebrand ﬂux from actual 
ﬁre  sources,  from  various  building  elements,  and  vegetative  fuel 
sources. The ability to actually measure ﬁrebrand ﬂuxes and ﬁre- 
brand temperatures from various fuel sources is needed. 

To be able to better describe ﬁrebrand combustion process, im- 
proved transient models of ﬁrebrand burning (ﬂaming and glow- 
ing) including char growth, effect of the char layer on a ﬁrebrand’s 
burning  rate,  and  extinction  by  the  growth  of  a  char  layer  are 
needed. 

More experimental ignition data from structural fuel elements, 
especially with a focus small crevices and grooves. Firebrands are 
known  to  be  able  to  ignite  decking  assemblies  and  other  con- 
struction  features  due  their  ability  to  become  lodged  into  gaps 
and crevices. More experimental work is needed to better quantify 
these ignition events. 

Better  experimental  methodologies  and  associated  models  to 
characterize ﬁrebrand generation from real ﬁre sources, such as ac- 
tual WUI, urban, and informal settlement ﬁres. To be able to im- 
prove ﬁrebrand generation models requires much needed experi- 
mental data. At the same time, ﬁrebrand generation experiments 
require improved measurement methods to characterize effective 
ﬁre size coupled to the ﬁrebrand generation data. 

Understanding of the combined effects of ﬁrebrands and radi- 
ant or convective heat on ignition of diverse fuels. Nearly all the 
past research has been limited to only ignition induced purely by 
ﬁrebrand contact. Yet, it is natural to assume coupled inﬂuences of 
radiant, or convective, heat from surrounding ﬁre sources may only 
ease ignition of fuels exposed to ﬁrebrand showers. 

To be able to provide for better community resilience to large 
outdoor ﬁre exposures to ﬁrebrand showers requires internation- 
ally accepted test standards. To this end, a globally accepted test- 
ing methodology to evaluate material performance and structure 
design for ﬁrebrand exposures is needed. 

7. Summary 

Large outdoor ﬁres represent an increasing problem of global 
importance. A commonality in the rapid spread of large outdoor 
ﬁres, such as WUI ﬁres, urban ﬁres, and informal settlement ﬁres, 
are the production or generation of new, far smaller combustible 
fragments from the original ﬁre source referred to as ﬁrebrands. 
In the most simplistic representation, ﬁrebrand processes may be 
divided into several sub-processes, namely the generation of ﬁre- 
brands, their transport by plume lofting and drag forces with the 
wind, thermo-chemical degradation during ﬂight, deposition onto 
and ignition of fuel beds by either ﬂaming or smoldering, and the 
subsequent surface spread of the ﬁre. The current state of the art 
on these topics was reviewed, highlighting some recent progress. 
Yet, numerous other issues are needed in this complex process. 

The  generation  of  ﬁrebrands  remains  one  of  the  least  under- 
stood  sub-processes.  While  recent  studies  have  started  to  look 
at the mechanisms that generate ﬁrebrands, none have yet been 
adapted into a numerical formulation capable of initializing ﬁre- 
brand generation, in terms of mass, number, and so on, within nu- 
merical models. Future simulations necessitate a means to initial- 

ize ﬁrebrands from speciﬁc fuels under different burning and wind 
conditions so that past or future ﬁre events can be simulated. The 
distribution of ﬁrebrands coming off certain burning items under 
wind, mostly vegetation and structural components, has started to 
be well-detailed more recently, including distributions of size and 
mass of ﬁrebrands. Once models are developed, a host of validation 
exercises is possible. 

The  transport,  lofting  and  thermal  degradation  of  ﬁrebrands 
has  been  relatively  well  described  compared  to  other  processes. 
Starting  with  simpliﬁed  models  for  the  maximum  distance  ﬁre- 
brands can ﬂy, followed by coupled thermo-ﬂuid lofting formula- 
tions, there are a variety of well-described approaches in the liter- 
ature already adapted into numerical codes that describe the trans- 
port of ﬁrebrands both for simple 2-D surface spread calculations 
and 3D CFD simulations. While future development is still possible 
in this area, including issues such as the inﬂuence of initial loca- 
tion of the ﬁrebrand, effects of rotation in transport, further study 
of ﬁrebrand thermal degradation, and so on, the lack of an ability 
to initialize ﬁrebrands in the ﬁrst place shifts the priority to other 
aspects of the problem. 

The  deposition  of  ﬁrebrands  and  their  eventual  ignition  of 
smolder or ﬂaming vegetative spot ﬁres or structure ignition re- 
mains a critical, underserved area of study. Deposition is incredi- 
bly underserved and mostly appears only in coupled experiments 
with a ﬁrebrand generator under wind. These experiments are im- 
portant as they identify critical vulnerabilities in different struc- 
tural components, leading to changes in vent, eave, and other de- 
signs  and  test  standards  that  enhance  public  safety.  Still,  funda- 
mental experiments capable of describing the locations where ﬁre- 
brands  will  deposit  or  critical  conditions  for  ignition  based  on 
some  form  of  ﬁrebrand  deposition  properties  are  few  and  quite 
limited.  Several  studies  have  identiﬁed  critical  conditions  for  ig- 
nition of vegetative fuels and less for structural materials, but a 
theory or formulation that is more universal in nature, going be- 
yond the experimental conditions, is lacking. This is important for 
future model development, which may rely on a probabilistic ba- 
sis of ignition induced by ﬁrebrand, incorporating the even more 
complex process of transition from smoldering to ﬂaming. Identi- 
fying key thermal parameters at ignition, rather than just the ig- 
nition thresholds, may help to inform the development of these 
futures models, as well as improved modelling of both ﬁrebrand 
degradation/heating and eventual ignition of materials using state- 
of-the-art solid-phase models which already exist in the ﬁeld. The 
authors hope future research will continue to unravel this complex 
problem in an effort to better mitigate the destruction from large 
outdoor ﬁres.

Samuel L. Manzello joined the Fire Research Division of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), which is part of the United States Department 
of Commerce, in January 2001. Dr. Manzello’s research interests have been inten- 
tionally broad, and may be best described as bringing fundamental combustion 
knowledge to practical problems. His research in droplet-surface interaction was 
featured in the journal Nature. In addition to microgravity combustion, and droplet- 
surface interaction, he has led investigations on soot formation in a well-stirred 
reactor/plug ﬂow reactor, the physics of ﬁre-structure interaction, and most re- 
cently Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) ﬁres. The renown NIST Firebrand Generator 
or “Dragon” has enabled the investigation of vulnerabilities of structures to wind- 
driven ﬁrebrand showers for the ﬁrst time. Dr. Manzello has received many awards 
including a NASA Graduate Student Researcher Fellowship (NASA-GSRP), a National 
Research Council (NRC) Post-Doctoral Fellowship, a fellowship from the Japan Soci- 
ety for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), a NIST Individual Bronze Medal, NIST Engi- 
neering Laboratory (EL) Awards for best paper and Outstanding Communicator, the 
2015 Harry C. Biggelstone Award, the 2016 Tibor Z. Harmathy Award from Springer 
Nature, the 2016 Best Journal Paper Award from the Combustion Society of Japan, 
and the 2017 Samuel Wesley Stratton Award from NIST. He delivered invited ple- 
nary lectures at the 11th International Association for Fire Safety Science Sympo- 
sium in 2014, recognized as the most prestigious conference for ﬁre safety science 
research in the world, the 9th Asia-Oceania Symposium on Fire Science and Tech- 
nology Symposium in 2012, and the 2010 10th International Conference on Com- 
bustion and Energy Utilization. He has served as an invited Guest Editor for Fire 
Technology and Fire Safety Journal, is currently Associate Editor of Fire Technol- 
ogy, and on the Editorial Advisory Board of the journal Fire and Materials and Fire 
Safety Journal. He obtained his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University 
of Illinois-Chicago.
