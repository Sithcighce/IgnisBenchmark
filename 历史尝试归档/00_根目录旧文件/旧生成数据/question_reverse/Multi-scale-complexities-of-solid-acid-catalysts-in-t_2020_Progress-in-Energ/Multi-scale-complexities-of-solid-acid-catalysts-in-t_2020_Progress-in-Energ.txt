Despite remarkable progress in catalytic fast pyrolysis, bio-oil production is far from commercialization 
because of multi-scale challenges, and major constraints lie with catalysts. This review aims to intro- 
duce major constraints of acid catalysts and simultaneously to ﬁnd out possible solutions for the produc- 
tion of fuel-grade bio-oil in biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis. The catalytic activities of several materials 
which act as acid catalysts and the impacts of Bronsted and Lewis acid site on the formation of aro- 
matic hydrocarbons are discussed. Considering the complexity of catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass with 
acid catalysts, in-depth understandings of cracking, deoxygenation, carbon-carbon coupling, and aromati- 
zation for both in-situ and ex-situ conﬁgurations are emphasized. The limitation of diffusion along with 
coke formation, active site poisoning, thermal/hydrothermal deactivation, sintering, and low aromatics 
in bio-oil are process complexities with solid acid catalysts. The economic viability of large-scale bio- 
oil production demands progress in catalyst modiﬁcation or/and developing new catalysts. The potential 
of different catalyst modiﬁcation strategies for an adequate amount of acid sites and pore size conﬁne- 
ment is discussed. By critically evaluating the challenges and potential of catalyst modiﬁcation techniques, 
multi-functional catalysts may be an effective approach for selective conversion of biomass to bio-oil and 
chemicals through catalytic fast pyrolysis. This review offers a scientiﬁc reference for the research and 
development of catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Exploiting renewable energy 

Energy plays a vital role in economic development while ade- 
quate and sustainable energy is crucial for industrialization in any 
country. Global energy consumption by the entire human civiliza- 
tion is gradually increasing, and the energy consumption is com- 
paratively higher in Asia and Paciﬁc regions [1] . Fossil fuels meet a 
large part of energy demand, and according to a statistical review 
of global energy, the fractions of total energy are oil (32%), coal 
(27%), gas (22%), biomass (10%) and electricity (9%) [2] . Due to ex- 
tensive utilization of fossil fuel resources, these non-renewable re- 
sources will not last forever as oil, coal and gas will be depleted in 
about 45, 120 and 60 years, respectively. Furthermore, dependence 
on imported fossil fuels poses economic threats to the sustainabil- 
ity of a country [3] . On the other hand, open burning is a common 
practice to deal with waste materials especially in Asian countries. 
Approximately, 7.3 × 10 8 tons of biomass are burned per year in 
Asia as crop residue burning, forest ﬁres, and grassland ﬁres, etc 
[4] .  Crop  residue  burning  is  not  only  common  in  Asia  but  also 
worldwide, which is a concern for air pollutant emissions and pub- 

lic health risks [5 , 6] . Among environmental pollutants, polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkyl polycyclic aromatic hydro- 
carbons (APAHs) are reported to create mutagenic and carcinogenic 
substances, and to cause developmental, reproductive, cardiology, 
hematology, neuro and immune-toxicities in the human body [7 , 8] . 
Concerns  over  fossil  fuel  depletion  and  environmental  pollu- 
tion with greenhouse gas emission are challenging issues to ad- 
dress climate change and mitigate energy consumption [9 , 10] . The 
promotion  of  renewable  energy  production  is  essential  for  sus- 
tainable  development.  Abundant  and  low-cost  renewable  energy 
sources, such as lignocellulosic biomass, organic wastes and poly- 
mers (plastic materials) have created a wide interest to produce 
biofuels  and  bio-based  chemicals  [3 , 11] .  In  the  renewable  fuels 
standard program of the United States (US), it has been proposed 
that 1.36 × 10 8 L of renewable fuel can be generated from ligno- 
cellulosic biomass by 2022, and 56.9% production is expected from 
the agricultural residues [12] . 

1.2. Catalytic pyrolysis for bio-fuels 

A number of pathways for the conversion of biomass feedstock 
and waste materials to fuels or chemicals have been studied and

some  are  still  under  development.  Broadly,  conversion  pathways 
exist in two types: thermochemical and biological [13] . Different 
thermochemical approaches, like combustion, gasiﬁcation, liquefac- 
tion and pyrolysis are applied. Among them, pyrolysis has received 
increased attention  due  to  carbon  neutrality  and  relatively  inex- 
pensive technology for the production of renewable energy [14 , 15] . 
Based on the heating rate, the pyrolysis process can be classiﬁed 
into three types: slow (0.1-1 °C/s), intermediate (1-200 °C/s) and 
fast pyrolysis (20 0-10 0 0 °C/s or ﬂash pyrolysis) [16] . Fast pyrolysis 
enhances bio-oil yield suppressing the char formation compared to 
slow and intermediate pyrolysis [16] , and introducing catalysts in 
fast pyrolysis has become a prominent technology because of its 
potential to enhance the bio-oil quality [17-19] . 

The  application  of  solid  acid  catalysts  in  pyrolysis  of  a  wide 
range  of  feedstocks  is  of  increasing  importance  because  of  eﬃ- 
cient catalytic activity in response to aromatization, deoxygenation, 
reusability  and  thermal  stability  [20 , 21] .  In  last  decades,  various 
types of zeolites (ZSM-5, Y zeolite, MCM-41 zeolite, β-zeolite, SBA- 
15 zeolite and novel zeolite) [22-26] , hierarchical catalysts [27 , 28] , 
solid acid (silica-alumina) [29 , 30] and inexpensive solid materials 
(bentonite  clay  and  activated  red  mud)  [31-33]  have  been  stud- 
ied extensively in biomass pyrolysis and upgrading of bio-oil. Si- 
multaneously, basic catalysts, like CaO and MgO have been applied 
in biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis considering their excellent de- 
acidiﬁcation, resulting in lower acidity and higher heating value of 
bio-oil [34] . Fermoso et al. observed that MgO is an active cata- 
lyst for ketonization of carboxylic acid in catalytic fast pyrolysis of 
Eucalyptus woodchips [35] . Generally, basic catalysts are non-toxic 
and low-cost materials than solid acid catalysts [36] and have the 
potentials  to  crack  large-molecular  oxygenates,  leading  to  an  in- 
crease in smaller-molecular compounds in bio-oil [37] . The use of 
CaO was found effective to eliminate a signiﬁcant amount of sug- 
ars and nitrogen-containing compounds and increase the aliphatic 
hydrocarbon in the bio-oil, however, less effective for aromatic hy- 
drocarbon production than solid acid catalyst at the same operat- 
ing conditions of pyrolysis [38 , 39] . 

Shape  selectivity  of  solid  acid  catalysts  is  a  crucial  factor  for 
catalytic fast pyrolysis that promotes the cleavage of C-C and C- 
O  bonds  on  acid  sites  and  increases  the  selectivity  to  hydrocar- 
bons in bio-oil. Until recently, much research has been undertaken 
to determine effects of tuning the shape selectivity of catalysts in 
terms of particle size, shape, surface area, porosity and acidity in 
order to produce chemically stable and high-quality bio-oil with 
larger fractions of aromatics from catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass 
[40 , 41] . Despite several improvements, a number of constraints ex- 
ist including low yield and poor quality of bio-oil, diffusional com- 
plexity of catalyst, quick deactivation and poisoning of active sites 
of catalyst because of coke deposition. These limitations imply the 
necessity  to further  develop catalysts and catalytic  fast  pyrolysis 
[42-45] . 

1.3. Scope of work 

A  number  of  review  papers  are  focused  on  biomass  struc- 
tural complexity [46] , pyrolysis reactor [16] , operating conditions 
[24 , 47 , 48] , catalytic pyrolysis mechanism [14 , 49-51] , pyrolysis ki- 
netics [52] , multi-scale complexity [23] and modeling of pyrolysis 
[53] . To the best of our knowledge, a review of multi-scale com- 
plexities of acid catalysts in fast pyrolysis is limited in the liter- 
ature,  which  motivated  us  to  write  this  paper.  In  the  early  part 
of this review paper, the potential of each conﬁguration has been 
studied  regarding  the  catalytic  activity,  product  distribution  and 
deactivation of catalysts. 

It is necessary to study various acid catalysts before their ap- 
plication in catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass. In order to give a 
brief idea, acidic zeolite and other heterogeneous acid catalysts in- 

cluding low-cost mesoporous materials (bentonite clay and acid- 
activated red mud) have been studied in this paper. The role of 
Bronsted  and  Lewis  acid  sites  of  acid  catalysts  on  catalytic  ac- 
tivity  has  been  presented  with  reaction  chemistry.  Major  chem- 
ical  routes  including  cracking,  carbon-carbon  coupling  reactions, 
steam reforming and aromatization have been presented to pro- 
vide useful insights about the chemistry with an acid catalyst dur- 
ing catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass. Several process complexities 
with acid catalysts including low catalytic activity, diffusional lim- 
itation along with coke formation, active site poisoning, sintering 
and thermal/hydrothermal deactivation have been discussed. The 
regeneration of spent catalysts is important from the point of view 
of catalyst expense and thus, much attention is given to this fac- 
tor. Also, various approaches for catalyst modiﬁcation towards ef- 
ﬁcient biomass conversion are outlined. At the end of this review, 
special attention is paid to the importance of multi-functional cat- 
alysts in pyrolysis. Based on the above review, conclusions and rec- 
ommendations are offered to solve the current complexities of acid 
catalysts. Therefore, the review paper provides an in-depth under- 
standing of the complexities of acid catalysts and simultaneously 
addresses catalytic activity for biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis. 

2. Catalytic fast pyrolysis (in-situ and ex-situ) 

Catalytic fast pyrolysis is a promising technology offering ther- 
mochemical conversion of a range of feedstocks including ligno- 
cellulosic  biomass  and  plastics  into  renewable  energies  (bio-oil, 
char,  and  syngas)  [54] .  Bio-oil  is  a  mixture  of  a  large  number 
of  condensable  chemicals  including  more  than  300  oxygenated 
compounds and has a lower hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio than 
petroleum. The chemical composition of bio-oil can be classiﬁed 
into  four  groups  based  on  the  relative  abundance  of  functional 
groups present (see Fig. 1 ): sugar-derived compounds; a variety of 
carboxylic acids which cause acidity in bio-oil; small carbonyl com- 
pounds which increase the viscosity of bio-oil through condensa- 
tion reaction; and lignin-derived compounds which contribute to 
the  instability  of  bio-oil,  although  formation  and  relative  abun- 
dance  of  these  functional  groups  in  bio-oil  largely  depend  on 
biomass and process severity [55] . Before addressing bio-oil as a 
substitute for traditional fossil-derived oil or direct use as a fuel in 
petroleum-based  infrastructure,  massive  chemical  transformation 
is required since higher concentration of chemically bound oxygen 
(almost 40%) in bio-oil contributes several undesirable characteris- 
tics, such as low heating value, high acidity and chemical instabil- 
ity [56 , 57] . 

The application of solid acid catalysts in catalytic pyrolysis has 
a great inﬂuence on the distribution of functional groups in bio-oil, 
where channel structure, pore sizes and acidity control catalysis re- 
actions over zeolite catalysts [58] . Functional groups, for example, 
sugar compounds, acid, aldehyde, ketone, furan, and alcohol pro- 
duced from biomass degradation easily diffuse into zeolite chan- 
nels and take part in a number of reactions to release oxygen, end- 
ing up with the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and coke [59] . 
Ben et al. observed that HZSM-5 with a relatively higher Si/Al im- 
proves the elimination of methoxyl groups and causes nearly com- 
plete degradation of aliphatic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, while 
zeolite with a lower Si/Al shows better eﬃciency in cracking reac- 
tions of carboxylic acid during lignin pyrolysis [60] . Furthermore, 
the pH value of bio-oil from catalytic pyrolysis is much higher than 
bio-oil from a non-catalytic process as a result of the elimination of 
acidic groups by decarboxylation over solid acid catalysts [61 , 62] . 

Over  the  last  few  years  of  pyrolysis  research,  the  removal  of 
oxygenating fractions (deoxygenation) has been increasingly stud- 
ied to upgrade the quality of bio-oil [63] . According to the loca- 
tion of a catalyst in the pyrolysis process, catalytic fast pyrolysis 
of biomass is classiﬁed into two reaction modes: in-situ and ex-

Fig. 2.  Schematic diagram of two catalysis modes in catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass; (a) in-situ, and (b) ex-situ (adapted from [64] ) 

situ (presented in Fig. 2 ). The in-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis is a 
single reactor process where biomass and catalyst are introduced 
in a reactor to explore pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading together. 
In the in-situ catalysis mode, a pure catalyst or catalyst-sand mix- 
ture is used as a heat carrier, and pyrolysis vapors generated from 
thermal degradation of biomass diffuse into the catalyst pores and 
follow  the  catalytic  cracking  reactions  [64] .  On  the  other  hand, 
ex-situ  catalytic  fast  pyrolysis  entails  the  transferring  of  pyroly- 
sis vapors from the initial pyrolysis reactor to a secondary reac- 
tor where pyrolysis vapors contact with catalyst and undergo cat- 
alytic  cracking  reactions  [64 , 65] .  Control  of  temperatures  in  the 

primary and secondary reactors could be only achieved in the ex- 
situ  catalysis  mode  [66] .  Another  advantage  of  this  approach  is 
secondary  input  of  steam  or  hydrogen  to  the  secondary  or  up- 
grading reactor that improves the composition and quality of py- 
rolysis liquid [67] . The ex-situ conﬁguration also extends the cat- 
alyst  life  span  by  reducing  the  effects  of  coking  and  preventing 
metal contamination. Different bench-scale reactor types, such as 
ﬁxed bed for pinewood [68] , and oak [69] , circulating ﬂuidized bed 
for commercial lignocellulosic biomass  [70] , conical spouted  bed 
for miscanthus and giganteus [71] , bubbling ﬂuidized bed for pine 
wood [72 , 73] , cellulose [74] , auger-reactor for pine wood [75] have

biomass. 

2 , CO, and H 

Catalytic fast pyrolysis with in-situ or ex-situ conﬁguration re- 
moves most active oxygenates from pyrolysis vapors in the form of 
2 O [75] . The effectiveness of two conﬁgurations can 
CO 
be observed for hydrocarbon yield, deoxygenation, and selectivity 
to speciﬁc compounds. From the perspective of product selectiv- 
ity,  alkylation  and  dealkylation  reactions  play  a  vital  role  while 
alkylation occurs with the decrease in temperature and dealkyla- 
tion is vice versa in both in-situ and ex-situ pyrolysis (see Fig. 3 ). 
The in-situ process exerted more selectivity to xylene and larger 
aromatics with a carbon number of 9, and ex-situ had higher se- 
lectivity to benzene and toluene during pyrolysis of beetle-killed 
tree  over  HZSM-5  [76] .  When  the  fast  pyrolysis  of  miscanthus 
and giganteus over ZSM-5 catalyst was operated in a bench-scale 
spouted-bed reactor, ex-situ conﬁguration shows more selectivity 
to mono-aromatic hydrocarbons, whereas in-situ process resulted 
in  a  higher  yield  of  bio-oil  containing  high  molecular  naphtha- 
lene, methyl naphthalenes, dimethyl naphthalenes, and alkyl naph- 
thalenes  and  oxygenates  (carboxylic  acids,  guaiacols,  pyrans,  ke- 
tones, and aldehydes) [63] . 

In a tandem micro-reactor system, ex-situ catalytic fast pyroly- 
sis of poplar at high catalyst to biomass ratio (20:1) resulted in a 
higher yield of oleﬁns and permanent gas accompanied by a lower 
yield of aromatic hydrocarbons than in-situ mode. Longer contact 
time  in  the  in-situ  reaction  mode  favors  the  oligomerization  of 
small oleﬁns on acid sites within the zeolite pores and results in a 
high number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. A higher yield of car- 
bonaceous residue was also found in the in-situ conﬁguration with 
a lower mass transfer rate due to high loading of catalyst favoring 
coke formation and deactivation of zeolite catalyst compared to ex- 
situ mode having a lower char and coke yield [66] . In the catalytic 
fast pyrolysis of pinewood over faujasite zeolite catalysts (Na-FAU, 
0.8 -FAU, and H-FAU) in a ﬁxed bed reactor, ex-situ mode was 
Na 
found  to  be  superior  to  in-situ  mode  regarding  oxygen  removal 
degree and bio-oil quality. The inhomogeneous reaction tempera- 
ture and poor solid/solid contact (catalyst to biomass) have been 
reported for a lower rate of oxygen removal (23%) in the in-situ 
0.8 - 
mode, whereas the ex-situ mode with the same catalyst (Na 
FAU) led to 31% oxygen removal [68] . The ex-situ conﬁguration also 
provides better control and ﬂexibility in catalytic upgrading of bio- 
oil where the operating conditions and catalytic reaction could be 
individually optimized, which is absent in in-situ upgrading pro- 
cess. Furthermore, serial catalyst beds could be suggested and ap- 

0.2 H

plied to the ex-situ upgrading process if necessary [49] . In the cat- 
alytic pyrolysis of pine wood in a bench-scale ﬂuidized bed reactor, 
more deactivation of HZSM-5 catalyst was attributed to the in-situ 
conﬁguration and therefore, results in a higher bio-oil yield con- 
taining more oxygenates and acid fractions than ex-situ conﬁgu- 
ration [72] . Similarly, the in-situ reaction mode produced a higher 
amount of bio-oil and less char yield, whereas ex-situ mode was 
more selective to aromatic hydrocarbon during catalytic pyrolysis 
of  lignin  [77] .  The  ex-situ  reaction  mode  was  also  found  to  in- 
crease the deoxygenation process as syngas production increased 
with a lesser yield of CO 
2 . There was no biomass-derived ash de- 
position on catalyst surface during ex-situ mode, and consequently, 
ex-situ reaction mode shows high eﬃciency in avoiding poisoning 
than in-situ mode and prolongs the lifetime of acid catalyst [78] . A 
comparison of key features between in-situ and ex-situ modes of 
catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass is summarized in Table 1 . 

The catalytic activity of solid acid catalysts differs according to 
reaction modes, for instance, the use of catalyst lowers the decom- 
position temperature of biomass components in the in-situ mode, 
increases selectivity to polyaromatic hydrocarbons but catalyst de- 
activation is more rapid than in the ex-situ mode. It is diﬃcult to 
suggest the reaction mode of catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass be- 
cause biomass and reactor types have effects on the yield of bio- 
oil. From the point of view of selectivity to monoaromatic hydro- 
carbons and high quality of bio-oil, ex-situ conﬁguration seems to 
be better and could be an eﬃcient mode of catalytic fast pyrolysis 
of a wide range of feedstocks because of deoxygenation and better 
control. 

3. Solid acid catalysts for catalytic fast pyrolysis 

3.1. Acidic zeolite 

4 ] 4 − and [AlO 

In the catalytic pyrolysis, zeolite is one of the most commonly 
used heterogeneous catalysts because of acidity and shape selec- 
tivity where the three-dimensional framework of zeolite consists 
4 ] 5-  and possesses 
of corner-sharing tetrahedral [SiO 
channels  and  cages  with  molecular  dimension  up  to  10  ˚A  [79] . 
The  zeolite  structure  differs  in  the  channel  size  (8-,  10-,  12-  or 
14- rings), connectivity of channel and existence of cases in chan- 
nels or channel intersections [80-86] . Small pore zeolite contains 
eight-ring pores with diameters of 0.30-0.45 nm, for example, ze- 
olite A; medium pore zeolite is formed by ten-ring pores with free 
diameters of 0.45-0.60 nm, like ZSM-5; large pore zeolite consists

Advantages 

Disadvantages 

In-situ 

Ex-situ 

• In-situ reaction mode requires a lower capital investment 
because of a single reactor. 
• It is easier to perform the catalytic reaction and vapor 
upgrading. 
• The decomposition temperature of lignin is relatively lower 
and therefore, results in much higher selectivity to phenol. 

• Ex-situ conﬁguration allows individual control of operating 
conditions and catalytic reactions in the pyrolizer and upgrading 
reactor. 
• Ex-situ reaction mode is highly selective to desirable aromatics 
mainly benzene and toluene among products. 
• It allows serial catalyst beds in the vapor-phase catalytic 
upgrading process. 

• Fewer alkane products which lead to relatively lower carbon 
atom eﬃciency. 
• Selectivity to undesirable polyaromatics is higher. 

• Catalyst deactivation is rapid due to the coke formation, 
deposition, and blockage of pores of the catalyst. 
• The inhomogeneous reaction temperature and poor solid/solid 
contact (catalyst to biomass) cause a lower deoxygenation 
process. 
• The use of hot-gas ﬁlter to mitigate metal accumulation causes 
carbon loss. 

• The conﬁguration complexity of ex-situ catalysis leads to an 
increase in the total project investment than in-situ mode. 

Fig. 4.  Different zeolite pore sizes presented with oxygen packing model (adapted from [86] ) 

of 12-ring pores with 0.6-0.8 nm in free diameter, e.g., zeolite X 
and Y; and extra-large pore zeolite contains 14-ring pores with di- 
ameters of 0.7-1.0 nm (zeolite UTD-1) (see Fig. 4 ). Chemically, the 
isomorphic substitution of Si 4 + by Al 3 + induces a negative charge 
in tetrahedral (T) sites of zeolite framework while a cation is re- 
quired to balance or satisfy the Al tetrahedron and if the cation 
is a proton, it generates Bronsted acid sites (Al-O(H)-Si) [80] . On 
the other hand, Lewis acidity in the zeolite framework is a result 
of the distribution of extra-framework aluminum species, which is 
not tetrahedral-bonded in the framework. The Lewis acidity largely 
depends on the localization of extra-framework cation and coordi- 
nation with oxygen in the zeolite framework [81-83] . In an extra- 
framework cation distribution and coordination based on 3D to 2D 
transformation, a stronger interaction of a cation with the zeolite 
framework makes Lewis acid strength weaker because cation lo- 
cation and coordination with oxygen within framework determine 
the strength [81] . However, the distribution of aluminum (Al) in 
the zeolite framework is not random but largely varies depending 
on its preparation and post-synthesis modiﬁcation. Hence, acidity, 
acid strength and number of acid sites (Bronsted or Lewis acid) are 
important factors for both catalytic activity and selectivity, which 
largely depend on the composition (SiO 
3 ) and the presence 
of extra framework in the zeolite [84 , 85] . 

2 /Al 

2 O 

The amount of silicon in zeolite structure represents a key pa- 
rameter  for  the  total  number  of  acid  sites  (Bronsted  and  Lewis 
acid)  because  decreasing  silicon  aluminum  ratio  (SAR)  upon  de- 
silication  increases  the  total  acidity  in  different  zeolite  catalysts 
[87 , 88] while the increasing trend of Lewis acid site is compara- 
tively higher than Bronsted acid site [89 , 90] . The transformation 

of  some  Bronsted  acid  sites  into  weaker  Lewis  acid  sites  is  due 
to the removal of Si-OH sites during desilication with alkali. Dur- 
ing Si 4 + removal by alkali treatment, a certain amount of Al 3 + is 
extracted and precipitated on zeolite’s external surface. Thus, the 
presence of extra-framework residues on zeolite framework is at- 
tributed to the formation of a higher number of Lewis acid sites 
upon  desilication  [91] .  However,  the  desilication  process  corre- 
sponds to the decrease in the number of Bronsted acid sites, but 
the accessibility of acid sites is increased [92-94] . In the acid cat- 
alyst with low SAR, average physical spacing between acid sites is 
closer than the catalyst with high SAR and increases the likelihood 
of blocking a nearby acid site with a reactant molecule acting on 
acid site. Zeolite catalysts with lower SAR led to an increase in the 
aromatic formation and coke deposition, therefore both aromatic 
yield and catalyst deactivation are dependent upon the number of 
acid sites  in zeolites [89] . Interestingly, acid treatment has been 
noted  with  the  leaching  of  cation  tetrahedral  structure  without 
changing framework aluminum, and replacement of exchangeable 
cations with protons (hydrogen ion) results in a higher number of 
Bronsted acid sites [95 , 96] . 

The catalytic performance of zeolite largely depends on the ac- 
cessibility of the Bronsted acid site in the framework. Bronsted acid 
sites on both the external and internal surface of zeolite are ma- 
jor active sites for transferring oxygenates into aromatics through 
cracking and deoxygenation reactions [97 , 98] . Bronsted acid sites 
catalyze  the  deoxygenation  (dehydration,  cracking,  decarbonyla- 
tion,  and  decarboxylation),  hydro-cracking,  hydro-deoxygenation 
and aromatization reactions and result in an increased amount of 
non-condensable  gas  [99 , 100] .  Zeolites  with  a  higher  number  of

Bronsted acid sites are more selective to monoaromatics and phe- 
nolics compared to zeolites having moderate Bronsted and Lewis 
acid sites in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of lignin [31] . The coopera- 
tive effect of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites of zeolite is also promi- 
nent during the synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 
furfural from cellulose and hemicellulose in which Bronsted acid 
sites play a vital role in the hydrolysis of the biomass component 
to monosaccharides [101 , 102] . Isomerization of aldoses to ketoses 
occurs on the Lewis acid sites. Further dehydration of aldoses and 
ketoses and conversion into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural 
take place on the Bronsted/Lewis acid sites as illustrated in Fig. 5 . 
An overall reaction pathway of γ -valerolactone (GVL) production 
from furfural on the Bronsted and Lewis acid sites in zeolite cat- 
alyst is presented in Fig. 6 . It can be summarized that dehydra- 
tion of hemicellulose occurs on the Bronsted acid site and is fol- 
lowed by furfural conversion into furfural alcohol (FA) on the Lewis 
acid site. Conversion of FA into levulinic acid (LA) and butyl levuli- 
nate (BL) occurs through a second Bronsted acid mediated reaction 
while successive transformation of LA/BL to 4-hydroxypentanoates 
(4-HPs) can be reported on the Lewis acid conversion. Finally, lac- 
tonization of 4-HPs leads to the formation of GVL. 

From the above discussion, it can be seen that Bronsted acid, 
Lewis acid and surface acidity of zeolite catalyst can be tailored 
to enhance the catalytic activity in pyrolysis. Acid sites of zeolites 

largely  depend  on  structural  SAR  and  extra-framework  Al.  There 
is no doubt that both Bronsted acid and Lewis acid sites play a 
vital role in the conversion of intermediates, but the signiﬁcance 
of Bronsted acid site on deoxygenation, cracking, C-C reactions and 
aromatization is relatively more than Lewis acid site. Therefore, ze- 
olites with relatively higher Bronsted acid sites could be suggested 
for a high fraction of aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil. 

3.2. Other heterogeneous acid and acid-activated catalyst 

In the catalytic fast pyrolysis, metal oxides possess potential in 
catalytic  cracking  of  lignocellulosic  biomass  and  producing  more 
stable  products  due  to  their  multivalent  nature  and  acid-base 
properties.  Also,  various  metal  and  transition  metal  oxides  have 
been studied as catalysts in catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass in 
2 , silica-alumina, and sulfated metal oxides (SO4 2 −/TiO 
which SiO 
2 , 
2 , and SO4 2 −/SnO 2 ) show acidic properties.

For bio-oil upgrading, γ -Al

have also been studied in pyrolysis of different biomass and were 
identiﬁed as potential catalysts for deoxygenation [103] . The pres- 
ence of alumina shows more selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons 
and provides better stability of bio-oil with a lower amount of ke-

study using Al

2 (rutile, T

support catalysts, it has been found that catalysts with a higher 
surface  area  result  in  better  catalytic  activity  of  solid  acid  cata- 
lysts. The Al 
3  was found to be the most effective support cat- 
alyst among the four tested catalysts in terms of lower oxygenates 
mainly carboxylic acids and increased aromatics and total hydro- 
carbons [104] . The catalytic effect of γ -alumina-supported tung- 
sten carbide (W 
3 ) on cracking (decarbonylation, and de- 
carboxylation) and aromatization on the Lewis acid sites is rela- 
tively better than γ -Al 
3 in terms of selectivity 
to gasoline compounds [105] .

3.2.2. Red mud 

Red mud or red sludge is the byproduct of bauxite processing 
to alumina, which is being used in the catalytic application [32] . 
It has a complex mixture of several metallic oxides in which ferric 
oxide (53.98%) is the main component among others, aluminium 
oxide  (13.53%),  silicon  oxide  (8.91%),  calcium  oxide  (8.87%),  tita- 
nium oxide (6.18%), sodium oxide (5.83%), and magnesium oxide 
(2.7%)  [106] .  The  disposal  of  red  mud  is  a  threat  to  the  envi- 
ronment  affecting  mainly  soil  and  groundwater  due  to  its  alka- 
line nature (pH > 12) and complex chemical compositions. How- 
ever, the higher amount of iron content in red mud is expected to 
impart catalytic activity, like hydrocarbon activation. Furthermore, 
red mud can accelerate thermal decomposition of acidic species, 
for example, acidic and formic acid, which are of interest in cat- 
alytic fast pyrolysis of biomass for bio-oil upgrading. Usually, the 
catalytic activity of red mud is low, but acid treatment which is 
one  of  the  activation  methods  can  be  employed  to  partially  re- 
move sodium and calcium, leading to structural reconstruction and 
improvement of red mud catalytic activity [107 , 108] . Modiﬁcation 
of red mud has high speciﬁc surface area, a porous structure and 
active  metal  oxides  [109-111] . Acid  modiﬁcation  of  red  mud  has 
been found to be catalytically more active to modify the structural 
compositions because iron is leached in the form of FeSO 
4 , which 
can catalyze further reactions. Red mud washed with sulfuric acid 
(10 wt.%) for catalytic pyrolysis of palm fruit bunch can be used 
as an alternative metal-ions source of mainly Fe, Al, and Ti to tar- 
get chemicals [112] . Therefore, the application of acid-activated red 
mud as a catalyst in fast pyrolysis is an eﬃcient technique to man- 
age hazardous pollutants. 

3.2.3. Bentonite clay 

3 PO 

Bentonite  clay  (aluminum  phyllosilicate)  is  a  naturally  found 
lamellar aluminosilicate mesoporous material that consists of alu- 
mina octahedral sheet sandwiched between two sheets of tetrahe- 
dral silica exhibiting a crystalline structure. The interlayer space of 
bentonite clay is usually occupied with cations, such as Na + , K + 
and Ca + that can be replaced with exchangeable cations like H + , 
resulting  in  a  higher  number  of  Bronsted  acid  sites  in  the  ben- 
tonite clay [95] . Natural bentonite clay (montmorillonite) treated 
with different acids (HCl, H 
2 SO 
4 
4 treatments can result in the destruction of crystallinity 
and H 
in bentonite structure while HCl-activated bentonite clay increased 
the considerable amount of monocyclic aromatics and naphthalene 
in the pyrolysis of lignin conserving crystalline structure [95] . A re- 
markable viscosity reducing effect of bentonite clay has been ob- 
served in the pyrolysis of pine woodchips ( Pinus halepensis ) [113] . 
In addition, the use of bentonite clay for catalytic cracking of bio- 
oil in order to produce green liquid hydrocarbon fuel resulted in 
a considerable increase in phenolics, ketones and aromatics [114] . 
Considering  low  cost,  bentonite  clay  with/without  activation  has 
been used as a catalyst in the catalytic pyrolysis of lignin [95] and

[116] . 

Recently,  a  number  of  heterogeneous  solid  acid  and  low-cost 
materials  have  been  studied  as  catalysts  in  fast  pyrolysis.  Low- 
cost materials require activation prior to usage in pyrolysis to in- 
crease catalytic activity. It can be seen that acid treatment is one 
of the most used techniques in increasing the surface area and acid 
strength, which are crucial for promoting catalytic cracking of oxy- 
genates. To the best of our knowledge, there is no economic feasi- 
bility study of red mud and bentonite clay as low-cost catalysts in 
pyrolysis. 

4. Reaction conditions affecting catalytic fast pyrolysis 

Catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass is largely affected by a num- 
ber  of  reaction  conditions,  such  as  temperature,  residence  time, 
catalyst-to-biomass ratio and atmosphere [48 , 117-120] . In this re- 
view, the inﬂuences of key reaction conditions on pyrolysis prod- 
ucts have been taken into account in the following section: 

4.1. Reaction temperature 

Reaction  temperature  including  pyrolysis  temperature  inside 
the reactor and catalytic temperature in catalyst bed is an impor- 
tant parameter that has a strong effect on the cracking reaction 
of  reactants  and  inﬂuences  the  product  yields  and  the  chemical 
compositions of bio-oil. Primarily, the bio-oil yield increased due 
to cracking, decomposition, and devolatilization of organic matter 
and  then  followed  a  decreasing  trend  due  to  secondary  thermal 
cracking of bio-oil, which is dominant at high temperatures and 
produces a signiﬁcant amount of gaseous products [121 , 122] . The 
phenolic and other aromatic hydrocarbons were decreased, and the 
selectivity of furan compounds from Eucalyptus was increased at 
a  temperature  above  500  °C  [123] .  It  has  also  been  found  that 
the concentration of hydrocarbon precursors generated from lignin 
degradation was maximum at 500 °C. Furthermore, the repolymer- 
ization of lignin fractions at above 500 °C promotes secondary char 
formation [123] . Low pyrolysis temperature (400 °C) is unable to 
breakdown the intermolecular bonds of biomass which results in 
lower gas and higher char yields [124] . On the other hand, with 
increasing temperature from 400 °C to 700 °C, the amount of syn- 
gas increased, while char yield decreased. The maximum yield of 
bio-oil  (50  wt.%)  was  found  at  500  °C  and  then  started  to  de- 
crease with increasing temperature although moisture content in 
bio-oil decreased from 27.3% (500 °C) to 7.0% (700 °C) over core- 
shell ZSM-5@SBA-15 [124] . Tan et al. reported that the bio-oil yield 
increased from 51.30 wt.% to 59.48 wt.%, while the gas yield de- 
creased slightly from 22.30 wt.% to 16.79 wt.% when the tempera- 
ture increased from 400 °C to 600 °C [29] . However, the discrep- 
ancy in secondary thermal cracking temperature may be because 
of different biomass and catalyst usage in pyrolysis. 

The increase of reaction temperature enhances deoxygenations, 
and  the  fraction  of  oxygenating  species  decreased  from  7.1%  for 
450 °C to 2.3% and 1.9% for 550 °C and 750 °C, respectively [125] . 
The deoxygenation reactions result in a high abundance of aromat- 
ics in which the selective yield of total BTX (benzene, toluene, and 
xylene) increased from 49.32% to 54.44% for increasing pyrolysis 
temperature from 500 °C to 800 °C [126] . It is worth noting that 
pyrolysis  temperature  signiﬁcantly  affects  the  selectivity  of  indi- 
vidual monoaromatics, for instance, benzene selectivity increased 
from 12% to 20% and toluene selectivity increased from 28.1% to 
29.6%, while xylene selectivity lessened from 28% to 23% when the 
temperature increased from 450 °C to 750 °C, respectively [127] . 
Xylene is produced from demethoxylation and dehydration reac- 
tions of G-type and P-type phenols [128] . The insuﬃcient amount 
of  xylene  precursor  and  conversion  of  xylene  into  benzene  and

toluene could be possible reasons for the reduction of xylene se- 
lectivity at higher pyrolysis temperature [129] . 

and that leads to polymerization to form coke on the surface of 
catalysts [139] . 

4.2. Residence time of vapors 

4.4. Pyrolysis atmosphere 

To maximize bio-oil yield, the residence time of vapors is an- 
other  important  parameter  because  longer  residence  time  pro- 
motes  secondary  cracking  reactions,  which  results  in  a  high  gas 
yield,  reduced  the  liquid  yield  and  affects  the  bio-oil  quality 
[130 , 131] . In the pyrolysis atmosphere, the residence time of py- 
rolysis  vapors  is  largely  dependent  on  the  gas  ﬂow  rate  [120] . 
However,  increasing  the  residence  time  from  0.25  s  to  1.5  s 
in  the  catalyst  (HZSM-5)  bed  was  found  to  decrease  the  oxy- 
genates  from  48.7%  to  1.9%,  whereas  oxygenates  in  bio-oil  at 
a  short  residence  time  of  0.25  s  was  similar  to  non-catalytic 
pyrolysis  [125] .  It  has  also  been  reported  that  the  increase  in 
residence  time  in  the  catalyst  bed  results  in  more  contacting 
chances for pyrolysis vapors and HZSM-5, thus promoting crack- 
ing  as well as  deoxygenation of  oxygenates  to  gas  products  due 
to  the  prolonged contact  between pyrolysis vapors  and HZSM-5. 
However,  the  residence  time  of  vapors  in  the  pyrolysis  reactor 
should  be  less  than  2  s  to  promote  yield  and  quality  of  bio-oil 
by  minimizing  the  secondary  reactions  in  biomass  catalytic  fast 
pyrolysis [132 , 133] . 

4.3. Catalyst-to-biomass ratio 

The catalyst-to-biomass (C/B) ratio is a key operational variable, 
which signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the catalytic reactions and the selec- 
tivity of the pyrolysis products in catalytic fast pyrolysis [133 , 134] . 
It has been found that the BTX yield increased with a high amount 
of Z βH catalyst in catalytic fast pyrolysis of algae and the increas- 
ing trend was in the following order: 19.74% (50:1) > 12.44% (20:1) 
> 7.9% (10:1) > 3.18% (2:1) [135] . Naphthalene and methyl naph- 
thalene were prevalent at high C/B ratios (20:1 and 50:1), while 
indole and its derivatives are common polyaromatics at low load- 
ings (2:1 and 10:1). In the catalytic pyrolysis of durian rind, the 
silica-alumina was varied from 0.1 g to 0.3 g when the amount of 
biomass was constant at 3 g [29] . Results revealed that the bio-oil 
yield decreased and the gas yield increased with a high loading of 
catalyst. In the deoxygenation or cracking processes, decarboxyla- 
tion was dominant at a low amount of catalyst, and the trend of 
deoxygenation changed to decarboxylation with high catalyst load- 
ing. Oxygen-containing species, like furans, are cracked and con- 
verted  into  desirable  hydrocarbons,  mainly  neopentane  with  in- 
creased catalyst loading. 

Similarly,  an  increase  in  catalyst  loading  led  to  a  high  frac- 
tion of hydrocarbon and suppressed the formation of nitrogenated 
compounds  in  the  bio-oil  from  algae  over  Ni-modiﬁed  zeolite-Y 
[136] . Balasundram et al. studied the inﬂuence of different catalyst 
loadings from 0.5 g to 2 g with a constant amount of sugarcane 
bagasse (1 g) and found that the bio-oil yield initially increased 
from 46.2% (0.5:1) to 48.5% (1:1) and then dropped to 46.5% and 
44.2% for higher C/B of 1.5:1 and 2:1, respectively [137] . The non- 
condensable gas yield was reported to increase with a high loading 
of HZSM-5, which promoted the secondary cracking of volatiles to 
gas due to its high amount of acid sites. On the other hand, the 
aromatic  hydrocarbon  yield  increased  slightly  from  3.0%  to  3.5% 
when C/B was increased from 2:1 to 4:1, whereas further increase 
to 8:1 did not promote the production of aromatic hydrocarbons 
from beetle-killed lodgepole pine over HZSM-5 [138] . This might 
be  due  to  the  difference  in  biomass,  pyrolysis  temperature  and 
other operating conditions. However, a high amount of coke with 
increasing C/B ratio is a common phenomenon in catalytic fast py- 
rolysis [137 , 138] . The high amount of catalysts induces the diffu- 
sion limitation by trapping more pyrolysis vapors inside pores [77] , 

In general, pyrolysis is carried out in the absence of oxygen un- 
der a nitrogen atmosphere. Notably, the nitrogen ﬂow affects the 
vapor residence time by removing pyrolysis vapors from the reac- 
tor and a high nitrogen ﬂow rate minimizes the secondary reac- 
tions [140] . Low nitrogen gas ﬂow rate (400 mL/min) increases the 
vapor residence time inside the reactor, whereas a high ﬂow rate 
(700 mL/min) limits the cracking of char [141] . The maximum bio- 
oil yield (35.95%) with a 21.01% organic phase was observed at a 
nitrogen gas ﬂow rate of 600 mL/min. Kim et al. studied the role 
of the sweeping gas ﬂow rate in an auger intermediate pyrolysis 
system [142] . Results revealed that sweeping gas had a negligible 
effect on bio-oil yield; however, increasing the sweeping gas ﬂow 
rate promoted the formation of organic compounds in bio-oil. Re- 
cently, the nitrogen atmosphere in the catalytic pyrolysis has been 
shifted towards the vacuum condition while nitrogen gas ﬂow is 
turned off and a vacuum pump is connected to the pyrolysis sys- 
tem [143 , 144] . At the end of catalytic pyrolysis under vacuum con- 
ditions, nitrogen gas is introduced in order to prevent the oxidation 
of bio-oil [144] . 

Results revealed that bio-oil yields increased by 5.3% and 5.4% 
in catalytic pyrolysis of pomegranate marcs and grape marcs, re- 
spectively  under  vacuum  conditions  because  the  vacuum  system 
requires  shorter  vapor  residence  time  than  the  nitrogen  atmo- 
sphere [143] . It is also observed that char formation was remark- 
ably suppressed in the vacuum system compared to the nitrogen 
atmosphere. The use of a vacuum pump to remove primary frag- 
ments increases the mass transfer driving force of vapors, result- 
ing in short vapor residence time in the reactor. Furthermore, the 
vacuum condition decreases the boiling point of organics, lowering 
the average volatilization temperature. Thus, the vacuum pyrolysis 
system restricts the secondary reactions and lowers the char yield 
[145 , 146] . 

5. Reaction chemistry over acid catalyst 

In catalytic  fast  pyrolysis,  the  role  of  an  acid  catalyst  is  con- 
sidered to enhance the removal of oxygenating fractions in selec- 
tive ways, convert the reactive species into chemically stable ones 
and  increase  the  organic  components  in  bio-oil.  In  this  context, 
acids, aldehydes and ketones are the most active oxygenates which 
are attributed to the poor heating value and instability of bio-oil 
[54] . Major chemical routes including cracking and deoxygenation, 
carbon-carbon  coupling  reactions,  steam  reforming  and  aromati- 
zation are discussed in the following sections to understand the 
chemistry with an acid catalyst during catalytic fast pyrolysis. 

5.1. Cracking and deoxygenation 

Catalytic cracking in pyrolysis involving photolytic cracking in 
terms of cleavage of C-C bonds, hydrogen transfer, isomerization, 
side-chain scission of aromatics and deoxygenation reaction helps 
to  release  oxygen  atoms  from  bio-oil  and  convert  heavy  com- 
pounds formed from re-polymerization or fragmentation into low- 
molecular  weight  compounds.  In  particular,  dehydration,  decar- 
boxylation and decarbonylation are three main pathways for de- 
oxygenation reactions leading to a decreased amount of oxygenates 
[147 , 148] . Catalytic cracking of structural components in terms of 
deoxygenation  during  pyrolysis  of  lignocellulosic  biomass  is  de- 
picted in Fig. 7 . 

The  catalytic  cracking  of  cellulose  is  a  complicated  pro- 
cess  that  starts  with  the  breaking  of  glycosidic  bonds  and 

10

Fig. 7.  Catalytic cracking of structural components during fast pyrolysis over acid catalysts (adapted from [17 , 30 , 148] ) 

generates anhydro-sugars (anhydro-monosaccharide and anhydro- 
oligosaccharide),  anhydro-sugar  derivatives,  furans,  other  light 
oxygenates  and  ﬁnally  aromatics  (see  Fig.  7 ).  The  cracking 
of  β-1,4-glycosidic  bond  in  cellulose  initially  forms  anhydro- 
monosaccaride  and  anhydro-oligosaccharide  with  the  release 
of  water.  Further  cracking  of  β-1,4-glycosidic  bond  generates 
anhydro-monosaccharide  from  anhydro-oligosaccharide.  Levoglu- 
cosan (LGA) is the most abundant anhydro-monosaccharide result- 
ing from the sequential breaking of two glycosidic bonds (C1-O and 
O-C4 (cid:3) )  [149] .  Upon  further  dehydration,  LGA  produces  anhydro- 
sugar  derivatives  including  1,6-anhydro- β-D-glucofuranose  (AGF), 
1,4:3,6-dianhydro- α- d -glucopyranose  (DGP)  and  levoglucosenone 
(LGO). These anhydro-monosaccharide and anhydro-sugar deriva- 
tives undergo further dehydration and transform into furan com- 
pounds (FUR), whereas fragmentation and retro-aldol condensation 
reactions generate light oxygenates, such as glycolaldehyde and 3- 
heptanol [150] . In the pyran rings, the acetal reaction and cycliza- 
tion between the C2 and C5 correspond to the formation of furan 
compounds. 

In general, the formation of glycolaldehyde initiates hemolytic 
bond scission (C4-C5) and is accompanied by one glycosidic bond 
cleavage  during  intermediate  reactions.  Further  hemolytic  cleav- 
age  of  the  C1-O  bond  and  breakdown  of  the  second  glyco- 
sidic  linkage  lead  to  the  formation  of  glycolaldehyde  and  non- 
volatile intermediate (2,3-hydroxyl-succinaldehyde) [148] . On the 
other  hand,  cracking  of  glycosidic  bonds  (C5-O  and  C4-O)  pro- 
duces  a  short-lived  intermediate,  which  undergoes  further  frag- 
mentation while C1-C2 bond scission generates one unit of formic 
acid  from  glucose  intermediate.  However,  all  chemical  reactions 
for  the  transformation  of  cellulose  into  furan  compounds  and 
light  oxygenates  have  been  reported  to  occur  on  the  surface  of 
acid catalysts [148 , 150] . In the catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose, β- 
1,4-glycosidic  bond  also  plays  a  vital  role  in  BTX  and  phenol 
production  because  the  partial  cracking  of β-1,4-glycosidic  bond 
produces  anhydro-oligosaccharides  (anhydro-cellobiose,  anhydro- 

cellotriose  and  anhydro-cellotetrose)  [151]  that  can  diffuse  into 
acid catalyst pores and undergo a series of reactions, such as cat- 
alytic dehydration, decarbonylation, decarboxylation and oligomer- 
ization at active sites to convert into aromatics and phenols. De- 
spite the conversion of intermediate oxygenates of cellulose pyrol- 
2 -C 
ysis (furans and glycolaldehyde) into monocyclic aromatics, C 
4 
oleﬁns and C 
5 compounds inside the zeolite framework, anhydro- 
monosaccharides produced from cellulose, cellobiose and glucose 
can not undergo further conversion to aromatics or phenols over 
NaY [148] . 

Distinctive  from  cracking  of  cellulose,  hemicellulose  degrada- 
tion patterns can be summarized by three steps [17 , 30 , 152] , as fol- 
lows: ( 1 ) depolymerization of the xylan into xylose and double- 
hydrated xylose by glycosidic bond cleavage, (2) production of fu- 
ran and pyran ring derivatives by depolymerization, rearrangement 
and  dehydration,  and  (3)  competing  ring  scissions  of  furan  and 
pyran  derivatives  and  formation  of  light  oxygenates,  like  acetic 
acid,  formic  acid,  carboxylic  acid,  aldehyde,  hydroxyacetone  and 
2-methyl furan. Cracking of hemicellulose can either occur in the 
gaseous phase or with an acid catalyst. The cleavage of glycosidic 
bond  in  xylan  produces  xylosyl  cation,  an  unstable  intermediate 
considering the lack of carbon on the sixth position and a substi- 
tuted oxygen on the fourth position. However, further cleavage of 
glycosidic bond in xylosyl cation and dehydration produces DAXP1 
and DAXP2 (see Fig. 7 ). On the other hand, xylosyl cation can un- 
dergo cracking followed by addition of H +  and OH − in its vicin- 
ity  to  generate  xylose.  The  elimination  of  active  O-acetyl  group 
from O-acetyl-xylan leads to the formation of acetic acid, whereas 
both O-C5 bond scission and ring formation between C2-C5 po- 
sitions on the main chain of hemicellulose (xylan and mannose) 
produce  HMF  (5-hydroxymethyl-furfural)  [153] .  The  HMF  under- 
goes further conversion to 2-furaldehyde and 2-methylfuran. The 
formation of furan derivatives is restrained over the acid zeolite, 
which promotes deoxygenation reactions with the release of more 
oxygen [154] . The ultra-stable Y (USY) zeolite is found to be better 

R. Liu, M. Sarker and Md.M. Rahman et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 80 (2020) 100852 

11 

for deoxygenation of acidic compounds, while H- β is effective only 
at higher temperatures. It is reported that xylose along with light 
oxygenates, such as acetic acid (AA), carboxylic acid (CA), formic 
acid (FA), alcohols (ALC), and furaldehyde can enter zeolite pores 
and undergo deoxygenation reactions to be converted into C 
2 – C 
6 
oleﬁns, which then are further converted to aliphatic and aromatic 
hydrocarbon on acid site [155 , 156] . 

The  depolymerization  of  lignin  favors  the  formation  of  large 
alkoxyphenols and dimers, whereas cracking of C-O and C-C bonds 
in lignin produces small alkoxyphenols, such as guaiacol, vanillin 
and  creosol  [157] ,  which  are  transformed  into  mono-phenolics 
(alkylphenols)  through  cracking,  dealkoxylation,  dehydration,  de- 
carboxylation, isomerization, and oligomerization on the acid sites 
of catalysts. In the presence of Bronsted acid sites, mono-phenolics 
are converted to aromatics either via dehydroxylation, dehydration 
and cracking or via aromatization of small oleﬁns formed through 
catalytic cracking and dehydration of mono-phenolics [60] . 

Oxygen-containing  species  follow  different  deoxygenation  re- 
actions  over  acid  catalysts.  For  example,  alcohols  only  undergo 
dehydration  reaction  and  are  converted  into  oleﬁns  followed  by 
the conversion to alkanes and aromatics over zeolite catalyst. Car- 
boxylic acid and ester functionalities undergo dehydration and de- 
carbonylation reactions and release oxygen. In the furfural conver- 
sion, decarbonylation reaction generates furan from furfural, which 
is  further  converted  into  intermediate  compounds  (cyclohexene 
and 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde) inside the ZSM-5 catalyst and then 
converted into aromatics, light oleﬁns and coke following the de- 
carboxylation reaction [158] . Phenolic intermediates are very reac- 
tive for polymerization reactions and form coke instead of hydro- 
carbon production over catalysts [159] , while cracking of guaiacol 
increases coke deposition on the acid sites of catalyst [160] . Crack- 
ing and deoxygenation reactions in catalytic fast pyrolysis over dif- 
ferent acid catalysts are presented in Table S1 in the Supplemen- 
tary Material [29 , 32 , 77 , 87 , 144 , 148 , 159 , 161-168] . 

It is noteworthy that the amount of catalyst with higher num- 
ber  of  acid  sites  has  a  signiﬁcant  impact  on  deoxygenation  re- 
actions as lower loading of zeolite catalyst corresponds to dehy- 
dration  and  decarboxylation.  Whereas,  decarbonylation  is  domi- 
nant for a higher zeolite to biomass ratio ( > 0.3) that can be as- 
cribed as the extension of oxygen removal in the form of CO. A 
similar pattern of deoxygenation selectivity was found for HZSM- 
5 to biomass ratios in the range of 0.4 to 0.7 [169] . Catalytically- 
derived carbon oxides (CO x ) consisting of CO 
2 and CO were found 
higher  over  HZSM-5  than  thermally-derived  CO x  from  cellulose 
and hemicellulose, which corresponds to the overwhelming acid- 
catalyzed deoxygenations. A lower catalytic conversion of phenolic 
compounds  results  in  decreased  carbon  oxides  yield  during  cat- 
alytic  pyrolysis  of  lignin  over  HZSM-5  than  its  thermal  conver- 
sion.  However,  decarbonylation  reactions  have  been  found  to  be 
predominantly followed by dehydration or decarboxylation on acid 
sites of n-ZSM-5 [170] . On the other hand, Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst was 
found to be effective in decarboxylation reaction compared to de- 
carbonylation for the same feedstock [171] . However, most of the 
thermally-produced  oxygenated  species  undergo  decarbonylation 
reaction other than decarboxylation to expel oxygen and are con- 
verted into aromatics over parent catalysts. 

Interestingly, there is a linear relationship between the catalytic 
decarbonylation and the formation of aromatics. The aromatic yield 
from the three structural components was in the following order: 
cellulose > hemicellulose > lignin, while the highest CO yield was 
16.4%  from  cellulose  and  followed  by  hemicellulose  (13.9%)  and 
lignin (7.9%) [17] . Zeolite catalysts are noted with a high degree of 
deoxygenation potential, leading to increased amount of aromatic 
hydrocarbons in bio-oil. However, strong acid sites promote sec- 
ondary cracking and consequently, result in decrease in the bio-oil 
yield with extensive coke formation [35 , 56] . 

2  – C 

In summary, cracking and deoxygenation lead to the transfor- 
mation  of  light  oxygenates  into  C 
6  oleﬁns,  whereas  high 
molecular oxygenates, mainly lignin derivatives are converted into 
mono-phenolics  releasing  oxygen  during  catalytic  pyrolysis.  The 
amount of oxygenates is reduced, while aliphatic hydrocarbons and 
deoxygenated molecules are generated for further carbon-carbon 
coupling  and  aromatization  reactions.  Thus,  cracking  and  deoxy- 
genation over solid acid catalysts eliminate reactive species in the 
vapor phase and improve chemical stability of bio-oil than that of 
non-catalytic pyrolysis. Accelerated dehydration is one of the main 
causes of hydrogen loss during pyrolysis. On the other hand, de- 
carboxylation (CO 
2 ) is more effective to remove oxygen than decar- 
bonylation (CO). Therefore, future studies on deoxygenation should 
focus on decarboxylation followed by decarbonylation and ﬁnally 
dehydration during catalytic fast pyrolysis. 

5.2. Carbon-carbon coupling reaction 

As  discussed  in  earlier  sections,  a  wide  range  of  catalysts 
have been studied in the pyrolysis process, however, bio-oil con- 
sists of several reactive molecules (alcohols, aldehydes, acids, ke- 
tones,  furans,  oleﬁns  and  alkylphenols),  which  have  the  poten- 
tial  to  increase  the  carbon  number  of  bio-oil  through  carbon- 
carbon  (C ˗C)  coupling  reactions.  A  number  of  studies  have  fo- 
cused  on  C ˗C  coupling  reactions,  including  aldol  condensation, 
ketonization,  oligomerization,  Diels-Alder  reaction  and  alkyla- 
tion/hydroxyalkylation, and it can be seen that all these reactions 
have  a  signiﬁcant  role  in  reducing  oxygen  functionalities  along 
with increasing carbon number in bio-oil [172-175] . 

5.2.1. Aldol condensation 

The carbon-chain length of biomass-derived molecules is gen- 
erally limited to 3-9 carbon atoms. For the eﬃcient application of 
bio-oil as transportation fuel, the desired carbon-chain length of 
molecules needs to be 8 + carbon atoms. Aldol condensation is an 
eﬃcient route for C-C bond formation and also deoxygenation of 
pyrolysis vapors [176-179] that typically occurs between two car- 
bonyl compounds in the presence of a reactive α-hydrogen on one 
carbonyl (see Fig. 8 ). 

7 to C 

In  many  research,  aldol  condensation  of  different  biomass- 
derived  compounds  has  been  studied  over  different  catalysts  to 
produce hydrocarbons in the diesel fuel range [180 , 181] . While, al- 
dol condensation between HMF and other furfural products, like 
acetone  is  a  well-known  strategy  for  the  deoxygenation  of  fu- 
ran species along with the production of alkanes as illustrated in 
Fig. 9 . Aldol condensation between two carbonyl compounds takes 
place  on  acid  site  in  the  zeolite  framework  [182]  and  acid  sites 
generated  from  metal  cations  impregnation  enhance  the  overall 
process  [183] .  Interestingly,  aldol  condensation  reaction  between 
furfural/HMF  and  acetone  over  metal  oxide  catalysts  produces  a 
15 hydrocarbons [184 , 185] . The presence of 
higher yield of C 
K 
2 O in H-BEA catalyst enhances the catalytic activity in aldol con- 
densation without coke formation rather than parent H-BEA cata- 
lyst [177] . In a similar way, K 
2 O species as a strong basic site in 
USY  exhibited  higher  catalytic  activity  in  aldol  condensation  be- 
tween  furfural  and  acetone  compared  to  ion-exchange  catalysts 
[186] . Textural characteristics of zeolite catalyst signiﬁcantly inﬂu- 
ence the aldol condensation reaction. The alkane yield from aldol 
condensation of furfural and acetone is not more than 10% over 
medium pore MFI and wide pore mono-dimensional MOR zeolites, 
whereas wide pore three-dimensional structure increases transfor- 
mation to H-form and thereby, BEA zeolite results in 30% of fur- 
fural  conversion  to  alkane  [182] .  It  can  be  concluded  that  both 
acidity and crystal structure of zeolite are crucial factors for deter- 
mining the aldol condensation, and basic sites can be introduced 
in the acid catalyst in order to promote aldol condensation.

5.2.2. Ketonization 

Ketonization has received considerable attention as an effective 
strategy  to  generate  C-C  bond  formation  in  the  biomass-derived 
compounds which are catalyzed by Bronsted acid site in acid cat- 
alysts. It is also considered a partial deoxygenation reaction dur- 
ing catalytic pyrolysis [43] . In ketonization, coupling of two C n OOH 
acids generates a ketone containing 2n-1 carbon atoms, CO 
2  and 
H 
2 O as shown in Fig. 10 , and this C-C coupling reaction can also 
occur between aldehydes. To date, a number of model compounds 
have been studied for ketonization over acid, base and bifunctional 
acid/base catalysts [185 , 187 , 188] . Carboxylic acid is potent enough 
to convert into short chain oxygenates, like ketone prior to the al- 
dol condensation step, thus lowering their fraction in bio-oil. How- 
ever, ketonization of the entire pyrolysis oxygenates is challenging 
as levoglucosan and cresol show negligible conversion and furfural 
has inhibiting effects on ketonization [184] . 

The conversion of acetic acid is expected to occur on nonequiv- 
alent active sites of catalysts with preferably higher acid strength. 
Based on the framework topology of zeolite, there are 12 nonequiv- 
alent acid sites in HZSM-5 catalyst which are suﬃcient for acetic 
acid conversion. A reaction mechanism of the conversion of acetic 
acid to hydrocarbon is presented in Fig. 11 . Generally, acetic acid is 
converted to acetate ion and is adsorbed on the strong acid sites at 
temperatures below 300 °C. Acetate ions start to desorb with fur- 
ther increase in temperature, and ketonization of acetic acid starts 

with  the  formation  of  acetone.  Two  moles  of  acetone  condense 
to  form  diacetone  alcohol  which  further  undergoes  aldol  con- 
densation  reaction,  forming  mesityl  oxide  (unsaturated  carbonyl 
compound) with the release of water. Mesityl oxides undergo fur- 
ther condensation and elimination reactions and generate butylene 
and  mesitylene.  These  hydrocarbons  undergo  a  series  of  further 
reactions,  such  as  cracking,  oligomerization,  dehydrocyclization, 
isomerization, hydrogen transfer and hydrocarbon pool mechanism 
to  form  a  complex  mixture  of  oleﬁns,  paraﬃns  and  aromatics 
[189] . Thus, small acetic fractions in the pyrolysis vapors are selec- 
tively converted into valuable fuel precursors through ketonization 
and cascade aldol condensation reactions [185 , 190 , 191] . 

5.2.3. Oligomerization and Diels-Alder reaction 

Two  other  alternative  approaches  for  carbon-carbon  coupling 
are  oligomerization  and  Diels-Alder  reaction,  however,  both  ap- 
proaches  require  reactants  with  C = C  bonds.  Several  research 
studies revealed that oligomerization and Diels-Alder reaction play 
a  vital  role  to  increase  the  hydrocarbon  yield  in  bio-oil,  while 
oligomerization  of  oxygenates  and  light  oleﬁns  is  of  interest  for 
aromatization  [192-194] .  Likewise,  light  oleﬁns,  like  ethene  and 
propene produced from dealkylation of lignin pyrolyzate undergo 
oligomerization  to  form  aromatics.  The  dehydrated  oleﬁns  pro- 
duced  from  biomass-derived  alcohols  can  be  converted  to  light 
16 ),  gasoline- 
oleﬁns  with  varying  chain  length  like  jet-  (C

oligomerization  over  ZSM-5  and  β-zeolite  [195] .  Again,  furan 
derivatives  undergo  oligomerization  reaction  inside  the  zeolite 
catalyst  pores  [196] .  Interestingly,  phenolic  compounds  are  in- 
dividually  converted  into  aromatics  by  oligomerization  reaction 
along with cracking and dehydration over zeolite catalysts [197] . In 
the Diels-Alder reaction, furanic compounds (furan, 2-methylfuran, 
furfural  and  furfural  alcohol)  react  with  aliphatic  hydrocarbon, 
mainly  oleﬁn  and  form  intermediate  compounds  which  further 
undergo dehydration reaction and produce toluene and p-xylene 
[198 , 199] . However, all these reactions occur on strong acid sites 
inside zeolite pores [200] . 

5.2.4. Alkylation and hydroxyalkylation 

Alkylation  is  another  potential  route  to  increase  the  carbon 
chain length of hydrocarbon in pyrolysis oil. A range of acid cat- 
alysts, such as zeolites, alumina, heteropoly acids and WO x /ZrO 
2 
have been studied for the alkylation of phenols with alkenes or 
alcohols [201 , 202] . Friedel-Craft alkylation in liquid is largely cat- 
alyzed by both Bronsted and Lewis acid site. In contrast, alkylation 
of aromatic can only occur on the Bronsted acid site [173] . Zeolite 
catalysts have been studied for aqueous phase alkylation of phenol 
with cyclohexanol as shown in Fig. 12 . Dehydration of cyclohexanol 
produces cyclohexene on the Bronsted acid site of zeolites that acts 
as an electrophile. Cyclohexene is then followed by alkylation with 
phenols where H-BEA catalysts show a higher selectivity toward 
alkylation than with La-BEA catalysts. A series of parallel reactions 
are in operation with a simple model compound, like cyclohexene, 
which undergoes rapid dehydrogenation on the Bronsted acid sites 
and  is  converted  to  cyclohexane,  therefore reducing  the  coupled 
products [203 , 204] . 

Again,  some  strong  Bronsted  acids  favor  trimerization  of  2- 
15  alkane) [205-207] . Fig. 13 
methylfuran to a diesel precursor (C 
shows  hydroxyalkylation/alkylation  of  2-methylfuran  with  alde- 
hyde.  It  can  be  seen  that  2-methylfuran  is  hydroxyalkylated  by 
aldehyde,  and  the  corresponding  product  undergoes  alkylation 
with another 2-methylfuran producing an > C 
11 oxygenated inter- 
mediate molecule. This intermediate oxygenated molecule further 

undergoes  hydrodeoxygenation  to  form  6-alkylundecane  (diesel 
precursor). 

The above discussion has focused on the potential of carbon- 
carbon  coupling  reactions  to  increase  the  fuel  range  molecules 
over  acid  catalysts.  Acid  catalysts  show  different  selectivity  to 
carbon-carbon  coupling  reactions.  Notably,  most  of  the  carbon- 
carbon  coupling  reactions  occur  on  the  Bronsted  acid  site  and 
largely  affected  by  both  acidity  and  pore  structure  of  acid  cata- 
lysts. Therefore, proper and controlled catalyst modiﬁcation would 
offer  opportunities  for  selective  C-C  bond  formation  in  the  ﬁnal 
biomass-derived molecules. 

5.3. Catalytic steam reforming 

2 and CO 

Steam reforming, which promotes the conversion of pyrolysis 
oxygenates to renewable H 
2 in the catalytic fast pyrolysis process 
[30] , is also an important reaction that occurred in the catalytic 
pyrolysis of biomass. A typical steam reforming of an oxygenate 
from biomass pyrolysis is presented as Eq. (1) [208] . Acetic acid is 
a low-molecular-weight oxygenate and undergoes rapid coking in 
pyrolysis which can be transformed into H 
2 through cat- 
alytic steam reforming [209] . It is accepted that Ni and Co-based 
catalysts have an excellent capability to crack C ˗C and C ˗H bonds in 
the oxygenates [210 , 211] . Similarly, other light oxygenates, such as 
acetol, acetone, and m-cresol can be converted into hydrogen in a 
catalytic fast pyrolysis process via steam reforming [212] . Akubo et 
al. studied pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming of six different agri- 
cultural wastes over 10 wt.% Ni-based alumina (NiAl 
3 ) in a two- 
stage ﬁxed bed reactor [213] . The gas yield along with a high pro- 
portion of hydrogen was signiﬁcantly increased due to the addition 
of steam and catalyst to the pyrolytic system. Results also revealed 
that compared to cellulose and hemicellulose, catalytic steam re- 
forming of lignin mainly generated hydrogen at 25.25 mmol/g in 
the syngas. Thus, catalytic steam reforming restricts coke forma- 
tion by converting oxygenates into H

5.4. Aromatization 

In catalytic fast pyrolysis, cracking of cellulose and hemicellu- 
lose generates furans and other light oxygenates, such as alcohols, 
acids, ketones and esters, whereas fragmentation of lignin mono- 
lignols  produces  monomeric  oxygenated  aromatics  [65 , 120 , 214] . 
After  cracking  and  deoxygenation  reactions,  aromatic  precursors 
undergo  aromatization  along  with  further  deoxygenation  reac- 
tions. There are three possible routes for hydrocarbon formation 
in  the  catalytic  fast  pyrolysis:  [50 , 124 , 162 , 194 , 215-217]  (1)  de- 
carbonylation, decarboxylation and oligomerization of dehydrated 
sugar derivatives like furans that generate aromatic hydrocarbons; 
(2) decarboxylation of carboxylic acids leads to the formation of 
aliphatic  hydrocarbons;  and  (3)  hydrogenation  of  phenols  pro- 
duces aromatic hydrocarbons. BTX and light oleﬁns, such as ethy- 
lene, propylene and butadiene are important petrochemicals pro- 
duced in catalytic fast pyrolysis and largely depend on shape se- 
lectivity  of  catalysts.  Among  widely  used  catalysts,  acidic  zeo- 
lites  have  been  found  most  selective  for  aromatic  hydrocarbons 
while  appropriate  pore  structure  and  acid  distribution  are  pre- 
requisites  for  maximum  aromatization  [218 , 219] .  Therefore,  too 
big  or  too  small  pores  and  too  much  or  too  less  acid  sites 
are  unfavorable  for  the  conversion  of  pyrolytic  intermediates  to 
aromatization [220] . 

Dehydrogenation cracking, oligomerization and cyclization de- 
hydrogenation are major aromatization reactions over zeolite cat- 
alysts that require synergies of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites. Al- 

though Bronsted acid sites in the zeolite framework are active sites 
for  aromatization  reactions,  dehydrogenation  or  hydrogen  atom 
transfer  reaction  occurs  on  the  Lewis  acid  sites  [40] .  With  zeo- 
lite catalysts, decarbonylation of furans produces allenes that un- 
dergo further oligomerization and cracking to form oleﬁns. Typi- 
cally, oleﬁns and alkanes act as hydrogen donors and react with 
furans to produce aromatics through Diels-Alder condensation fol- 
lowed  by  dehydration.  Currently,  the  hydrocarbon  pool  mecha- 
nism  has  been  suggested  to  explain  the  formation  of  aromatic 
hydrocarbons  in  catalytic  fast  pyrolysis  [221-224] .  Fig.  14  shows 
possible  reaction  pathways  for  aromatics  formation  through  the 
hydrocarbon  pool  mechanism  over  acid  zeolite.  In  hydrocarbon 
pool mechanism, dealkylation of lignin pyrolyzates, like alkylphe- 
nols  and  eugenols  produce  light  oleﬁns  (ethene  and  propene), 
that  further  undergo  oligomerization  leading  to  aromatic  forma- 
tion [225] . Both cracking and H-transfer reaction of phenolic pool 
occur on acid site of zeolite catalysts, leading to the aromatic for- 
mation (benzene, toluene and xylene) [223] . Nonetheless, the con- 
version of methanol and ethanol to aromatics through hydrocar- 
bon pool mechanism is widely studied and accepted [30 , 224] . The 
methanol to oleﬁn conversion study reveals that “hydrocarbon pool 
2 ) n ” reacts with methanol and generates smaller hydrocarbons 
(CH 
(ethylene, propylene and butene). Further polymerization of mono- 
cyclic aromatics generates undesired polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- 
bons.  Notably,  the  reaction  between  monoaromatic  hydrocarbon 
and oxygenate also produces polycyclic aromatics like naphthalene 
[32] .

Fig. 14.  Possible reaction pathway for aromatics formation through hydrocarbon pool mechanism over zeolite catalyst (adapted from [221] ) 

Up to date, a number of acidic zeolites have been studied in 
pyrolysis,  and  it  has  been  proved  that  acidic  zeolites  promote 
secondary  cracking,  oligomerization,  cyclization  dehydrogenation, 
aromatization,  and  polymerization  leading  to  partial  deoxygena- 
tion  of  pyrolysis  vapors  [169 , 226] .  Results  revealed  that  MCM- 
22  zeolite  is  less  effective  in  aromatization  activity  because  a 
higher  proportion  of  oxygenated  aromatics  and  a  lower  concen- 
tration  of  aromatics  are  found  in  bio-oil  over  MCM-22  in  par- 
ticular  when  compared  to  ZSM-5.  A  higher  amount  of  carbona- 
ceous residues (coke) is deposited on the surface of MCM-22 ze- 
olite. The weaker acid strength and presence of large cavities in 
the  framework  are  underlying  constraints  in  the  use  of  MCM- 
22 zeolite but this catalyst can be applied for the selective pro- 
duction of phenolic compounds [87] . According to research ﬁnd- 
ings, metal impregnated zeolites, such as Fe-ZSM-5 [227] , Ni/Co- 
ZSM-5 [228] , Ga-ZSM-5 [229] increase the selectivity towards aro- 
matic  hydrocarbons  and  the  hydrothermal  stability  of  modiﬁed 
catalysts  due  to  less  coke  formation  compared  to  parent  zeo- 
lites.  The  presence  of  metal  enhances  the  hydrocarbon  yield  by 

ensuring  available  hydrogen  for  the  formation  of  hydrocarbon 
molecules. 

Hierarchical mesopores in the zeolites showed less selectivity 
to  monocyclic  aromatics  with  a  higher  amount  of  coke  forma- 
tion. The selective removal of acid sites from the surface of ZSM- 
5 decreased the aromatic products and therefore, the concentra- 
tion  of  acid  sites  inside  the  zeolite  is  crucial  for  aromatization 
[230-232] . Desilication of zeolite has revealed that tailored desili- 
cation creates mesoporous-microporous structures in which meso- 
pores promote the conversion of oxygen-derived oxygenates, while 
micropores preserve the aromatization [92] . Again, the selectivity 
to mono-aromatic compounds is much higher for hierarchical ze- 
olites, particularly when compared to microporous zeolite [233] . It 
is interesting to note that tailored mesopores signiﬁcantly enhance 
the mass transfer of large molecules, like levoglucosan inside the 
zeolite channel and the accessibility to Bronsted acid sites where 
large oxygenates are converted into aromatics. 

According  to  the  above  discussion,  the  formation  of  aromatic 
hydrocarbon through aromatization or a hydrocarbon pool mech- 

16 

R. Liu, M. Sarker and Md.M. Rahman et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 80 (2020) 100852 

anism  occurs  solely  on  the  acid  sites  of  catalysts.  Aromatization 
reactions between furan compounds and oleﬁns not only generate 
monoaromatics, but also reduce oxygen fraction. It is noteworthy 
to mention that aromatization reactions improve the fuel proper- 
ties of bio-oil by adding aromatic fraction because a high propor- 
tion  of  aromatics  than  aliphatic  hydrocarbon  is  desirable  to  im- 
prove the  octane  number  of  crude  oil.  Therefore, pore size  con- 
ﬁnement and the appropriate amount of active acid sites can en- 
hance the aromatic hydrocarbon yield in the bio-oil. Furthermore, 
the ratio of Bronsted and Lewis acid site in the catalyst framework 
should be considered for a higher fraction of monoaromatics com- 
pared to polyaromatics. 

The  reaction  chemistry  with  an  acid  catalyst  can  be  summa- 
rized that a number of desirable reactions (deoxygenation, carbon- 
carbon coupling, and aromatization) and undesirable secondary re- 
actions  occur  in  parallel  in  the  vapor  phase  that  is  one  of  the 
multi-scale complexities in catalytic pyrolysis. Considering the ad- 
verse  impact  of  secondary  reactions  on  the  quality  and  yield  of 
bio-oil, selective catalysis reaction should be given more attention. 

It has been found that ZSM-5 zeolite having smaller microspore 
opening  shows  much  higher  product  selectivity  to  p-xylene  ( > 
90%) compared to conventional ZSM-5 (see Fig. 16 ). Interestingly, 
the decreased micropore size of treated ZSM-5 catalyst was in good 
agreement  with  the  kinetic  diameter  of  the  desired  product  (p- 
xylene) [244] . It can be noted that zeolite catalyst inﬂuences the 
product selectivity by its micropore size, and it would be a renew- 
able route to employ zeolite with suitable micropore size depend- 
ing  on  desired  products.  In  addition,  the  introduction  of  meso- 
pores into the micropore zeolite framework results in a dual pore 
system  (microporous/mesoporous).  Microporous/mesoporous  zeo- 
lite catalysts facilitate the pore access for processing of molecules 
which are larger than zeolite micropores but smaller than meso- 
pores and build channels for faster diffusion and mass transfer of 
bulky molecules to the active sites inside pores [242] . Therefore, 
dual pore systems enhance catalytic activity as well as selectivity 
to the desired products, thus avoiding unwanted secondary reac- 
tions and coke formation. 

6. Process complexity of pyrolysis with acid catalyst 

6.2. Catalyst deactivation 

6.1. Structural complexity 

The  tunable  microscopic  crystalline  structure  with  intercon- 
nected porous network, regular pore size, high surface area, strong 
Bronsted,  and  Lewis  acidity,  Si/Al  ratio  and  thermal  stability  is 
of great industrial importance of zeolite catalysts as good candi- 
dates for catalysis in petrochemical and chemical conversion pro- 
cesses  [234 , 235] .  For  instance,  HZSM-5,  H- β,  and  USY  enhance 
the  reactant diffusion and  access  to  acid sites  due  to  their  high 
surface  area  and  large  pore  volume  [236] .  The  Y-type  molecular 
sieves (Na-Y and USY) showed promising catalytic effects that in- 
clude  restraining  the  formation  of  light  oxygenates  and  increas- 
ing the yield of isoalkane and aromatics than HZSM-5 and H- β, 
although a maximum weight loss of biomass was found for H- β
zeolite [237] . Depending on the connectivity of channels, zeolite 
structure can be one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and 
three-dimensional (3D) with a pore size of a molecular dimension 
less than 1 nm [79 , 238] . The zeolite channel plays a vital role in 
adsorption and catalysis, and therefore shape selectivity of zeolite 
is crucial in the catalytic pyrolysis [239] . However, shape selectiv- 
ity of zeolite largely depends on pore opening, pore size, channel 
dimension and type, Si/Al ratio and spacing of cages to the host 
reactants and intermediates. Thus, structural information of zeolite 
catalyst is essential to explore the catalytic reactivity during py- 
rolysis. The selectivity properties of some representative medium-, 
large- and mesopore zeolites are summarized in Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Material [101 , 240] . 

Zeolite catalysts with medium micropore size in the range of 
4.0-5.9  ˚A  (ZSM-5,  ZSM-11,  TNU-9,  ZSM-23,  MCM-22,  Ferrierite, 
TNU-9 and SSZ-20) have been found to yield a higher amount of 
aromatics  while  zeolites  with  large  micropore  sizes  of  6.5-7.4  ˚A 
such as SSZ-55, β and Y zeolites produced a higher fraction of coke 
instead of producing aromatics. In contrast, there was no aromatic 
hydrocarbon formation over zeolites having very small micropore 
size of 3.9  ˚A (ZK-5, and SAPO-34), which produced only oxygenated 
compounds [241] . Typically, species with similar size to or greater 
than the dimension of zeolite pores suffer from strong diffusion 
limitation by rigid zeolite microstructure. Consequently, acid sites 
inside zeolite catalysts remain inaccessible to these intermediates, 
which  leads  to  the  coke  formation  and  deposition  on  the  cata- 
lyst surface. The diffusion limitation of reactants or intermediates 
would be an underlying reason for the change in desired product 
distribution [27 , 242 , 243] . Schematic diagram of reactant selectivity 
of catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 15 . 

Catalyst deactivation with coke deposition on the surface and 
poisoning of active sites are major barriers to pyrolysis with acid 
catalysts,  constituting  a  signiﬁcant  impact  on  the  economic  eﬃ- 
ciency of bio-oil. This section will discuss in detail thermal degra- 
dation,  sintering,  coke  formation,  active  site  poisoning  and  hy- 
drothermal deactivation during catalytic pyrolysis of biomass. 

6.2.1. Coke formation 

In biomass pyrolysis, there are always some carbonaceous solid 
residues, which are a mixture of char and coke and the amount 
largely  depends  on  the  process  parameters.  The  formation  of 
carbonaceous  solid  residues  is  parallel  to  the  bio-oil  and  non- 
condensable gas products. However, several researchers presented 
different explanations for the formation of char and coke in the 
literature, and now, it is well accepted that there are two types of 
coke in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass: one is thermal coke, also 
known as char, and another is catalytic coke [42 , 245-247] . Ther- 
mal coke or char is a result of thermal decomposition of structural 
components and secondary reactions of volatiles, generally located 
on the outer surface of catalysts used in pyrolysis. On the other 
hand, catalytic polymerization of intermediate compounds leads to 
coke formation on the acid sites of catalyst. Catalytic coke can be 
formed both inside and outside of catalyst pores [42 , 246] . A large 
portion of coke can be found on the surface of microporous cata- 
lysts [158] . Catalytic coke formation largely depends on the surface 
area, acid number and pore structure of catalysts. It is well known 
that coke formation results in undesirable product selectivity and 
catalyst deactivation. However, char may or may not decrease cat- 
alytic conversion depending on its formation and location. 

Several researchers have studied the reaction chemistry and ki- 
netics for the formation of coke and char using model compounds 
related  to  bio-oil  [247-249] .  Oleﬁns,  small  oxygenates,  aromatic 
oxygenates and aromatic hydrocarbons are typical coke precursors. 
Coke formation of a model aromatic compound (toluene) has been 
proposed with a production of PAHs, as shown in Fig. 17 . The re- 
action mechanism starts with self-alkylation of toluene and/or side 
alkylation with propylene followed by carbenium ion mechanism. 
A signiﬁcant decrease in biphenyls, bibenzyl and heavy PAHs, and 
an  increase  in  coke  yield  indicate  that  self-alkylation  (R1A)  and 
cyclization  of  bibenzyl  (R1C)  are  more  favorable  reaction  path- 
ways to contribute thermal and catalytic coke over acidic ZSM-5 
[247] . Isomerization of toluene is another proposed reaction path- 
way to phenanthrene through 5-ethenylidenecyclopenta-1,3-diene. 
Furthermore, naphthalene acts as an intermediate that undergoes

radical reactions leading to the formation of coke precursor ﬂuo- 
ranthene [250] . Diels-Alder reactions followed by a series of reac- 
tions, such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking, isomerization 
and hydrogen transfer reaction are notable main reaction pathways 
for the conversion of furans to coke. 

In catalytic pyrolysis, benzaldehyde and tolualdehyde are of in- 
terest to study reaction pathways to coke formation (see Fig. 17 ). 
These oxygenates undergo a decarbonylation reaction on the Bron- 
sted acid sites of catalysts to form toluene, while toluene follows 
the  same  scheme  for  coke  formation  (see  Fig.  18 ).  The  thermal 
cracking  of  tolualdehyde  produces  4-methylphenyl  radical  with 
the  release  of  CO  and  H  subsequently,  and  the  radical  under- 
goes  self-alkylation  reactions  forming  biphenyl,  diphenylmethane 
and coke. It has also been proposed that coke formation reaction 
of tolualdehyde can proceed via aldol condensation with acetone 
followed  by  dehydrogenation  and  cyclization  to  form  PAHs  and 
coke. 

Coke formation from another model compound (furan) is pre- 
sented  in  Fig.  19 .  It  can  be  seen  that  furan  undergoes  Diels 
Alder  reactions  (R3A)  to  form  hydrocarbon  pools,  such  as  ben- 
zene, propylene and other aromatics that act as coke precursors. 
Hydrolysis  of  furan  compounds  produces  oleﬁns  (R3B)  that  take 
part in the coke formation. Moreover, self-condensation of furans 
is a different pathway for coke formation compared to other model 
hydrocarbons forming benzofuran via ring opening (R3C). Subse- 
quently, benzofuran is converted to benzene and coke with the re- 
lease of CO. It is worth noting that coke produced from furan con- 
tains mostly carbon [247] . 

Overall  reaction  routes  for  different  model  compounds  reveal 
that oligomerization and polymerization reactions of hydrocarbons 
and oleﬁns produce large amounts of coke. Coke is produced from 
catalytic  polymerization  of  oxygenated  species  in  the  pyrolysis 
volatiles and deposited within the pores or/and outer surface of 
the catalysts. Large intermediates in initial volatiles can not diffuse 
into the micropores of acid catalysts like ZSM-5 and therefore, sec- 
ondary polymerization of these molecules produces coke on exter- 

nal acid sites of catalysts. Thus, gradual deposition of coke causes 
serious blockage of pore opening and channels ﬁnally resulting in 
catalyst deactivation [233 , 247] . Nevertheless, coke formation is the 
main mechanism for catalyst deactivation. The formation of metal 
oxide in metal modiﬁed catalysts could promote catalyst deactiva- 
tion [251] . 

6.2.2. Active site poisoning 

Similar to coking, poisoning of active sites depends on biomass 
compositions and other operating conditions. Notably, catalyst poi- 
soning is attributed to oxygen-containing compounds such as wa- 
ter, produced in catalytic pyrolysis by dehydration and hydrogenol- 
ysis [219] . Catalytic cracking of phospholipids and proteins in bio- 
oil produce sulfur, phosphorous and nitrogenous compounds that 
affect deoxygenation reaction leading to poisoning of active sites 
[252 , 253] .  Similarly,  microalgae  contains  high  amount  of  protein 
resulting in higher emission of NOx [254 , 255] , while excessive ni- 
trogenous compounds cause catalyst poisoning in catalytic pyroly- 
sis [256] . Inorganic content of biomass feedstock like Ca, Mg, and 
Cu  is  retained  in  the  char  which  deposits  on  catalysts  linearly 
[257] and results in active sites poisoning of heterogeneous cat- 
alysts during in-situ pyrolysis [258] . Most importantly, there is no 
direct contact between char and catalysts in the ex-situ mode, thus 
preventing acid site poisoning by inorganic residues [78] . Further- 
more, the deposition of heavy compounds results in the poison- 
ing of active sites of heterogeneous catalysts during deoxygenation 
process [259] . 

6.2.3. Thermal/hydrothermal deactivation 

In addition to coking and poisoning by impurities, deactivation 
of solid acid catalysts due to exposure to water vapor at high tem- 
peratures is known as thermal or hydrothermal deactivation. This 
is another constraint for catalytic cracking, especially for aqueous 
phase biomass processing. In the zeolite framework, hydrothermal 
stability depends on the density of defect and free silanols, which 
shortens catalyst life span and irreversibly affects the product dis- 

18

tribution [260 , 261] . Silanols defect, Bronsted acid sites and extra- 
framework cations facilitate surface wetting and determine the hy- 
drothermal  stability  [262] .  In  catalytic  pyrolysis,  the  presence  of 
moisture vapor is inevitable because dehydration during thermal 
decomposition of biomass structure and catalytic upgrading of py- 
rolysis vapor produce water vapor. Also, oxidation of char and coke 
during catalyst regeneration produces water vapor. The combined 
effect of produced water vapor and higher temperature in pyroly- 
sis (usually 500 °C) or regeneration temperature ( ≥ 650 °C) is the 
removal  of  aluminum  species  from  the  framework,  therefore  re- 
ducing the density of acid sites and catalytic strength of catalysts. 
Hydrothermal deactivation is irreversible compared to coking and 
poisoning, and it requires replacement with fresh catalysts as de- 
activated catalysts can not be restored again to its original catalytic 
activity. Consequently, hydrothermal deactivation is detrimental to 
the economic feasibility of catalytic pyrolysis as it increases the op- 
erating cost [261] . 

Among heterogeneous solid acid catalysts, zeolite is the most 
thermally stable catalyst, but signiﬁcant hydrothermal deactivation 
of ZSM-5 has been observed at 788 °C [261] . Another hydrother- 
mal stability study reveals that the addition of steam signiﬁcantly 

affects the catalytic activity and product distribution over ZSM-5 as 
aromatic fractions decrease from 17.5% to 11.2% [263] . Steam expo- 
sure to zeolite catalysts has been observed to change the structure 
irreversibly in terms of large crystal size and agglomerative parti- 
cles. In glucose to 5-HMF conversion, SBA-15 was modiﬁed with 
2 in order to improve stability in the hydrothermal process as

2  is  hydrothermally stable.  It  has  been found that  ZrO 
15 catalyst possesses excellent hydrothermal stability compared to 
mesoporous  SBA-15  [260] .  Hydrophobization  of  zeolite  with  oc- 
tadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) also exerts higher stability in water/oil 
emulsion to catalyze the alkylation of m-cresol with cyclopentanol 
into cyclic hydrocarbons [264] . 

6.2.4. Sintering 

Sintering  of  catalysts  results  from  (1)  reduction  in  catalytic 
surface  area  as  a  consequence  of  crystallite  growth  of  the  cat- 
alytic  phase  and  (2)  reduction  in  support  area  due  to  increase 
in particle size of the support or loss of porosity, leading to low 
catalytic activity [256 , 265] . Sintering largely depends on reaction 
temperature, presence of water and promoters, metal type, metal 
dispersion,  presence  of  impurities,  texture  and  porosity  support.

catalysts [265] . Higher operating temperature is a possible reason 
for sintering of catalysts in terms of blockage of pores by inorgan- 
ics, reduced catalytic surface area, and ﬂat and glossy surface of 
catalysts [266-268] . Both melting of solid particles and sintering 
may induce hydrodynamic and diffusional limitation of pyrolytic 
volatiles [269] . It is noteworthy that sintering is dominant when 
metals of low melting point are present in the catalyst, and crys- 
tallite migration, atomic migration, and vapor transport are three 
principal  mechanisms  for  metal  crystallite  growth.  Interestingly, 
chemical  compositions  also  play  a  vital  role  in  sintering  given 
that calcium and sodium in red mud have been observed to cause 
sintering [270] . Sintering of catalysts is irreversible and increases 
exponentially with temperature. Considering the complexity of sin- 

tering, the operating temperature of catalytic pyrolysis should be 
optimized. 

Catalyst deactivation by coke deposition is apparent in pyrol- 
ysis,  and  oligomerization  and  repolymerization  reactions  are  the 
most common reaction pathways for coke formation on the sur- 
face. There is a relationship among pore opening, number of acid 
site, surface acidity, Bronsted to Lewis acid site ratio and coke for- 
mation. Active site poisoning largely depends on biomass compo- 
nents that can be controllable, and ZSM-5 is relatively resistant to 
hydrothermal deactivation among solid acid catalysts. The reduc- 
tion in surface area results in sintering of catalysts. Finally, it can 
be seen that there is a co-relation between catalyst structure and 
its deactivation. Structural and chemical properties of acid catalysts 
still require further modiﬁcation and development to prevent cat- 
alyst deactivation in catalytic pyrolysis.

6.3. Bio-oil with low hydrocarbons 

The use of catalysts in pyrolysis has been found to dramatically 
improve the composition of bio-oil by both reducing the oxygenat- 
ing fractions through catalytic deoxygenation and simultaneously 
increasing  the  concentration  of  aromatic  hydrocarbon  in  bio-oil. 
Among catalysts used in pyrolysis, solid acid catalysts like zeolites 
have been found to be effective for both deoxygenation and arom- 
atization [271 , 272] . 

The bio-oil contains both oil phase and aqueous phase, and is a 
kind of oxygenated fuel containing undesired chemicals (acid, alco- 
hol, aldehyde, ketone, phenol and ester) and desired aliphatic and 
aromatic hydrocarbons. Polar and some organic compounds can be 
found in the aqueous phase due to their aﬃnity for water. On the 
other hand, the oil phase contains a higher concentration of or- 
ganic compounds than the aqueous phase [273 , 274] . The yield and 
selectivity  of  valuable  organic  chemicals,  like  oleﬁn,  alkane,  aro- 
matics, and phenols are largely dependent on the activity of cat- 
alysts. In the catalytic pyrolysis of maize straw, the highest selec- 
tivity for hydrocarbon (9.7%) was found over ZSM-5, where ZSM- 
5@SBA-15 showed lower selectivity (8.2%) for hydrocarbon [124] . 
Cai et al. studied the catalytic fast pyrolysis of rice husks in a ﬂu- 
idized bed reactor and found that the fraction of aldehyde, acid, 
and ester decreased, while phenol, ketone, and alcohol increased 
in the presence of ZSM-5 [275] . The abundance of phenolic com- 
pounds in bio-oil from rice husk was the highest one (45.07%) and 
hydrocarbon was the least one (0.82%). 

The  use  of  silica-alumina  catalysts  in  catalytic  pyrolysis  pro- 
moted  the  deoxygenation  degree  from  9.71%  to  35.15%  and  left 
lower oxygen content (31.07%) of bio-oil from karanja fruit hulls 
[276] . The silica-alumina catalyst was found to be eﬃcient in con- 
verting methyl ketone to aromatics, which increased the yield of 

bio-oil to 30.09%. In-situ pyrolysis of rape straw was studied over 
metal  modiﬁed  HZSM-5  where  the  yield  of  bio-oil  was  in  the 
range of 17.85-19.97% [40] . According to Mendes et al., bio-oil pro- 
duced from catalytic pyrolysis of pinewood contains a considerable 
amount of hydrocarbon and ketone, while carboxylic acid, cycloke- 
tones and oxygen-containing heterocyclic compounds are abundant 
in bio-oil from catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse over ZSM-5 
[277] . 

Summarizing the observations on bio-oil quality from catalytic 
fast pyrolysis, it is noteworthy that the bio-oil contains a high frac- 
tion of oxygenates, and the aromatic hydrocarbon is not suﬃcient 
to use bio-oil as a fuel substitute. Therefore, bio-oil requires further 
upgrading to gasoline and diesel type fuels [278] . In the catalytic 
pyrolysis,  formations  of  deoxygenated  bio-oil  and  carbonaceous 
solids happen in parallel [279] . Acid catalysts extend coke forma- 
tion and therefore, a high amount of carbonaceous solids not only 
affects product selectivity but also constitutes an underlying reason 
for active site poisoning and catalyst deactivation [41 , 78 , 261] . The 
yield of pyrolytic products in catalytic pyrolysis over different solid 
acid catalysts is given in Table S3 in the Supplementary Material 
[17 , 32 , 41 , 122 , 280 , 281] . It can be observed that both pore structure 
and catalyst acidity are crucial to the formation of aromatic hydro- 
carbon. Again, the formation of carbonaceous solids including char 
and coke exerts negative effects on the yield and quality of bio-oil 
which depends on the shape selectivity of acid catalysts. The re- 
duced amount of carbonaceous solids with minimum coke forma- 
tion would be a prerequisite for higher yield of bio-oil. However, 
possible reasons for reduced bio-oil with low organic yield over 
acid catalysts can be listed as follows: (1) less catalytic activity of 
catalysts with higher carbonaceous solids; (2) coke formation due 
to  diffusion  limitation  and  aﬃnity  of  acid  catalyst;  (3)  excessive 
cracking of volatiles to syngas due to strong acidity of catalysts;

21 

and (4) lack of hydrogen in the process for hydrocarbon formation 
due to low hydrogen to carbon effective (H/C 
eff) ratio in biomass 
and loss of H 

2 due to cracking and dehydration. 

From  the  view  of  multi-scale  complexities  of  an  acid  cata- 
lyst, structural complexity, acidity, catalytic activity, and deactiva- 
tion are closely connected. Microporous structure of zeolite cata- 
lysts exhibits diffusion restriction to large molecular intermediates, 
while polymerization reactions of oxygenates form undesired car- 
bonaceous solid, which is mainly coke instead of aromatics. Low 
amount of acid sites in the catalyst is not effective for catalytic re- 
actions, while a high number of acid sites improves the catalytic 
activity. However, very high number of acid sites result in excess 
cracking reactions which produce more gas than bio-oil. Further- 
more, high number of acid sites on the surface promote coke for- 
mation, which results in catalyst deactivation and poor quality of 
bio-oil. Thus, multi-scale structural complexity of acid catalysts af- 
fects the quality and yield of bio-oil in catalytic fast pyrolysis. 

7. Catalyst regeneration 

From the earlier section, it is clear that decreased activity and 
deactivation  of  catalysts  correlate  with  coke  deposition  exerting 
negative impacts on bio-oil quality during pyrolysis and bio-oil up- 
grading.  However,  several  researchers  have  worked  on  strategies 
for coke removal and regeneration of spent catalysts and suggest 
that a regeneration process may restore the textural properties to 
a state almost identical to that of fresh catalysts [78 , 130 , 256 , 282] . 
Post oxidative regeneration treatment is a very common technique 
where the concentration of oxygen is a crucial factor for restor- 
ing structural and chemical properties of spent catalysts. The pres- 
ence of oxygen at high temperature generates exothermic heat and 
steam, which may cause irreversible dealumination, leading to de- 
creased amount of weak and medium acid sites [283] . However, 
a  minimum  temperature  of  650  °C  for  20  min  regeneration  can 
restore the activity of spent ZSM-5 [284] . Additionally, the forma- 
tion of mesopores on the framework of spent catalysts is attributed 
to catalyst steaming at higher regeneration temperatures. Catalysts 
start to be deactivated within 10-30 min of the pyrolysis process, 
and therefore, periodic catalyst regeneration could play a key role 
in industrial-scale pyrolysis. 

In the regeneration process, an operating temperature of 600 °C 
for 20 min is not high enough for catalyst regeneration, however, 
increasing the temperature to 680 °C can be observed as effective 
for coke combustion, but results in decreased speciﬁc surface of 
post-regenerated catalysts than fresh catalysts [130] . For instance, 
spent catalysts were dried at 120 °C for 1 h and subsequently cal- 
cined in a muﬄe furnace at 650 °C for 2 h for the regeneration of 
spent catalysts [161] . The regenerated catalysts exhibited less sur- 
face area than fresh catalysts and relatively higher than spent cat- 
alysts. Furthermore, regenerated catalysts showed a stronger cat- 
alytic effect on bio-oil upgrading in terms of a higher fraction of 
monoaromatic  hydrocarbon.  Oxidation  of  coke  deposited  on  cat- 
alysts  is  a  possible  reason  for  overheating  that  causes  sintering 
and recrystallization, thereby reducing the micropore volume. Fur- 
thermore, it has been stated that all deactivated acid sites mainly 
located on external surface areas can not be completely regener- 
ated [285 , 286] . Catalyst regeneration was accomplished by wash- 
ing spent catalysts followed by calcination at 450 °C in the air for 
4 h and the results revealed that textural properties, like BET sur- 
face area, total pore volume, and pore size had been restored to its 
original state [282] . 

In addition to muﬄe furnace calcination, internally and exter- 
nally connected ﬂuidized bed reactors have been studied for both 
catalytic fast pyrolysis and catalyst regeneration [261 , 287] . Inter- 
nally connected reactors have been reported for simultaneous op- 
erations in petrochemical production and regeneration by a self- 

heating process. Regeneration of HZSM-5 was conducted using di- 
electric barrier discharge plasma, and the plasma-regenerated cat- 
alyst was found to be more selective to BTX with structural stabil- 
ity in comparison to thermally regenerated catalysts [287] . The BET 
surface area, pore volume, and total acid sites of catalyst have been 
reported to decrease dramatically with an increasing regeneration 
cycle.  A  moderate  regeneration  step  could  enhance  the  product 
distribution of hydrocarbons as a decreasing trend in hydrocarbon 
yield has been reported after the third cycle of regeneration [288] . 
A lower amount of acid sites results in reduced reaction rate and 
consequently, coking rate and coke yield decreased with regener- 
ated catalysts [289] . Interestingly, metal doping of catalysts exerts 
a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on coking rate, coke composition and its re- 
generation properties. Metal impregnation enhances coke oxidation 
and reduces regeneration temperature, thus resulting in a higher 
life span with a lower strain on catalysts [290] . Similarly, 10% Cu- 
loaded ZSM-5 shows reusability for catalytic cracking of bio-oil af- 
ter three regeneration cycles [291] . In order to limit catalyst degra- 
dation during the regeneration process, two-step regeneration has 
been suggested; where the ﬁrst step at a low temperature (250 °C) 
removes water, and the second step at a high temperature (400- 
700 °C) burns coke deposited on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, 
a higher catalytic activity has been found with 2-3 cycles, which 
then started to decrease after seven regeneration cycles. 

The regeneration of spent catalysts needs to be addressed for its 
further usage as an alternative to fresh catalysts in the petrochem- 
ical industry. Therefore, a regeneration process of catalysts should 
be carefully designed as local higher temperatures (hot-spots) due 
to exothermic oxidation of cokes during repeated regeneration can 
be an underlying reason for lower catalytic activity and even per- 
manent damage through sintering and dealumination. 

8. Catalyst modiﬁcation for eﬃcient biomass conversion 

The above discussion clearly shows that catalysts exert a num- 
ber of complexities, such as diffusion limitation, low catalytic activ- 
ity, low selectivity to aromatics and deactivation due to their non- 
uniform and microporous structure, insuﬃcient surface area, and 
active sites. However, several researchers have studied the devel- 
opment of novel heterogeneous solid catalysts by tuning physical 
and chemical properties as follows: 

8.1. Catalytic pyrolysis with bifunctional solid catalysts 

8.1.1. Synergistic effect of metal and solid acid catalysts 

Impregnation of metals on support materials exerts several ad- 
vantages,  including  low  production  cost,  high  stability,  and  high 
catalytic activity. The synergistic effect of metal and solid acid cat- 
alysts in bifunctional catalysts tailors the interaction of active sites 
with pyrolysis vapors and catalytic reaction pathways, leading to 
higher  selectivity  to  target  products  [278] .  Usually,  noble  metal 
centers (Pt, Pd, and Ru) and non-noble metal centers (La, Ni, Cu, 
Zn, Co, Mo, and Fe) are impregnated to acid catalysts to develop 
bifunctional catalysts [290 , 292-296] . 

Zhang et al. prepared Fe-modiﬁed ZSM-5 using different load- 
ings of Fe for catalytic pyrolysis of rice husk [296] . The fraction 
of hydrocarbon in bio-oil increased but the yield of bio-oil from 
rice husk showed a decreasing trend over ZSM-5 with a high con- 
centration  of  Fe.  Results  also  revealed  that  Fe  loading  promoted 
secondary  reactions  and  showed  more  selectivity  to  polymeriza- 
tion  to  form  naphthalene  and  its  derivatives  than  benzene  for- 
mation through alkylation. Another study of catalytic pyrolysis of 
pine sawdust over Fe-, Zr- and Co-modiﬁed catalysts showed that 
4% Fe/HZSM-5 and 4% Zr/HZSM-5 exhibited better catalytic activ- 
ity on deoxygenation of pyrolysis vapors and promoted aromatic 
hydrocarbons in bio-oil to 45.02% and 43.62%, respectively, while 

22 

R. Liu, M. Sarker and Md.M. Rahman et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 80 (2020) 100852 

the value is much lower (23.15%) for 4% Co/HZSM-5 [297] . A high 
amount of monoaromatics was found over 4% Zr/HZSM-5, whereas 
4%  Fe/HZSM-5  promoted  the  formation  of  polyaromatics.  It  has 
been  reported  that  the  loading  of  Cu  and  Zn  reduces  weak  and 
medium acid sites and creates new strong acid sites in the zeolite 
framework. In particular, the ion exchange by Zn 2 + creates Lewis 
acid sites, which coordinate with Bronsted acid sites and thereby 
accelerate dehydrogenation and aromatization [298] . The metal ac- 
tive  sites  in  Cu/ZSM-5  resist  the  chain  reactions  and  reduce  the 
amount of polar aromatic hydrocarbons containing sulfur, oxygen, 
and  nitrogen  [299] .  Dai  et  al.  studied  metal  (Fe  and  Ga)  modi- 
ﬁed hierarchical HZSM-5 to improve the catalytic performance for 
a higher yield of aromatics from cellulose [300] . Doping of Fe on 
hierarchical HZSM-5 increased the selectivity of BTX from 51.16% 
to 58.13% while the total yield of aromatics followed a decreasing 
trend because of low polyaromatics. Meanwhile, Ga modiﬁcation at 
a lower loading content (0.5%) signiﬁcantly increased the aromatics 
yield by promoting the formation of both BTX and alkylbenzenes. 
Additionally, Fe doping on hierarchical HZSM-5 was found less ef- 
fective to lower the char/coke yield than parent and Ga-modiﬁed 
hierarchical HZSM-5. For catalytic fast pyrolysis of rice straw into 
valuable aromatics, hierarchical HZSM-5 was impregnated with dif- 
ferent concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn and Ga [301] . There was no sig- 
niﬁcant difference in the selectivity of aromatics between 0.1% and 
0.5% metal loadings. Notably, the aromatic distribution changed as 
the  metal  loading  increased  to  1%.  Higher  loading  of  metal  will 
lead to blocking of the acid sites while minimum loadings of Ni 
and Cu on hierarchical HZSM-5 are beneﬁcial to the formation of 
aromatics. 

The metal loaded γ -Al 

3 catalysts promote the conversion of 
oxygenates into aromatics and aliphatic hydrocarbons [302] . Maxi- 
mum aromatic yield and high stability were observed for 2.5 wt.% 
Zn/ γ -Al 
3 catalyst, whereas the overloading of supporting metals 
may cause the sintering of metals during the thermal process. High 
amounts of metal loading reduce pore size and surface area, lead- 
ing to diffusion limitation and catalytic activity. In addition, high 
accumulation of metal species may lead to pore blockage and low 
catalytic activity. Effects of metal loaded bifunctional catalysts in 
catalytic pyrolysis are listed in Table S4 in the Supplementary Ma- 
terial [100 , 166 , 168 , 171 , 297 , 303-309] .

From Table S4, it can be summarized that metal loaded cata- 
lysts are eﬃcient in the conversion of biomass into fuel compounds 
rather than parent catalysts. The addition of metal reduces the sur- 
face area, pore volume and the total acid sites mainly the Bron- 
sted acid sites. A lower number of strong acid sites in the metal 
loaded bifunctional catalysts is the underlying reason for reduced 
coke formation [304] . Catalytic pyrolysis vapor upgrading with dif- 
ferent metal loaded catalysts showed the selectivity of metals to 
different reaction chemistries for aromatic hydrocarbon production 
(see Fig. 20 ). The order of deoxygenation over metal loaded cat- 
alysts is Ga-ZSM-5 > Zn-ZSM-5 > Ni-ZSM-5 > Co-ZSM-5 > Mg- 
ZSM-5 > Cu-ZSM-5 > HZSM-5. The benzene production follows an 
order of H > Ni~ Zn > Ga, whereas the order for toluene produc- 
tion is Zn > H > Ga > Cu > Ni > Mg > Co, and that for xylene 
is Zn > Mg > Ga > H, Co, Cu > Ni. Nevertheless, it is remark- 
able to note that catalytic activity of metal loaded catalysts largely 
depends on metal. Some metals, e.g. Fe, Co, and Mo exert negligi- 
ble effects on the aromatization and even lead to inhibitory effects 
during catalytic pyrolysis [100] . Furthermore, it can be stated that 
Ga and Zn are highly selective to aromatics and BTX rather than 
other metals loaded with zeolites [305 , 306] .

catalysts for bio-oil upgrading [162] . Alkali metal oxides have been 
found to be effective for ketonization and aldol condensation for 
the  conversion  of  carboxylic  acids  and  other  carbonyl  groups.  It 
is important to note that in alkali metal oxides, metal cation acts 
as Lewis acid and oxide ion acts as a base [310] . Ketonization of 
oxygenates over metal oxides can be observed through carboxylate 
mechanism, surface carboxylate mechanism (ketene-based mecha- 
nism, concerted mechanism, and β-ketoacid mechanism) and cy- 
cloketonization. The order of ketonization for different oxygenates 
is: carboxylic acid > aldehyde > alcohol > ester [311] . According 
to the rheological study of bio-oil treated with ZnO [312] , bio-oil 
behaves as a non-Newtonian and strong shear thinning liquid with 
relatively low viscosity.

The large surface area of zeolite catalyst makes it an excellent 
supporting material for the dispersion and conﬁnement of metal 
oxides within the framework [27] . In the catalytic cracking of bio- 
oil model compounds (oleic acid, methyl laurate and waste cook- 
3  modiﬁed  ZSM-5,  it  has  been  observed  that 
ing  oil)  with  La 
modiﬁed catalyst increases the pore opening and consequently, re- 
duces the diffusion limitations [313] . There is no signiﬁcant effect 
of  La 
3  on  the  total  acidity,  although  weak  and  medium  acid 
sites increase while strong acid sites decrease with higher load- 
ing of La 
3  modiﬁed ZSM-5 catalyst is 
found to have a better catalytic activity and anticoking ability com- 
pared to parent zeolite. On the other hand, the addition of metal 
oxides (MgO and ZnO) decreases the concentration of both Bron- 
sted and Lewis acid sites present in the zeolite framework [35] . 
Additionally, deposited metal oxides create Lewis acid sites, tailor- 
ing the catalytic performance to avoid excessive cracking of vapors. 
This results in a higher fraction of organic compounds and a lower 
amount of undesired PAHs and coke. 

3 . Furthermore, the La 

2 O

It  is  noted  that  bifunctional  catalysts  with  metals  and  metal 
oxides  have  a  greater  potential  to  promote  deoxygenation  and 
carbon-carbon coupling reactions than parent zeolites. Transition 
metals,  especially  Ga,  Zn  and  Cu  in  bifunctional  catalysts  create 
high amount of Lewis acid sites compared to other metals and in- 
crease the selectivity to BTX. Similarly, metal oxide creates Lewis 
acid site and increases the catalytic activity of bifunctional cata- 
lysts. The addition of basic metal oxide to acidic zeolite is appar- 
ent as a base and causes a decrease in carboxylic acid and carbonyl 
groups. 

8.2. Pre-coking 

Pre-coking is a treatment of zeolite catalyst to passivate the ex- 
ternal acid sites and prolong the life span of catalyst by reducing 
coke formation on its outer surface in catalytic pyrolysis [314] . A 
pre-coked ZSM-5 shows a better shape selective effect on the for- 
mation of target products and lowers the proportion of undesir- 
able oxygenates in oil fraction [315] . Pre-coking of zeolite leads to 
higher diffusivity between p-xylene and other xylene isomers. The 
m-xylene and o-xylene have lower diffusivity over pre-coked ze- 
olite, and p-xylene selectivity is increased among xylene isomers. 
Thus, pre-coke induces the space conﬁnement of zeolite in the py- 
rolysis [198] . Kim et al. carried out a pre-coking of Zn/ZSM-5 us- 
ing 2-methyl-2-butene to apply in the aromatization of 2-methyl- 
2-butene  [316] .  The  formation  of  pre-coke  improved  the  stabil- 
ity  of  the  catalyst  and  reduced  the  amount  of  strong  acid  sites 
in pre-coked Zn/ZSM-5 restricting the conversion of C 
12 
molecules, which acts as coke precursor in catalytic pyrolysis. The 
deposition of carbonaceous compounds during pre-coking deacti- 
vates some acid sites of ZSM-5 but retains the high activity of cat- 
alyst  for  methanol  conversion  to  propylene.  In  addition,  5%  pre- 
coking combined with 95% steam treatment showed a signiﬁcant 
improvement in the selectivity of propylene to a maximum of 42% 
[317] .

However, excessive pre-coking could reduce the effective pore 
size, deactivate the internal active sites and block the pores, thus 
restricting the entrance of oxygenates and leading to a higher frac- 
tion of unwanted species [318] . Hence, pre-coking should be con- 
trolled to promote shape selectivity and extend the lifetime of a 
zeolite catalyst in a pyrolysis reactor. 

8.3. Hierarchical catalyst 

In  order  to  reduce  the  steric  hindrance  and  diffusional  limi- 
tations of zeolites, different post-synthesis approaches have been 
employed towards producing mesoporous zeolites. These have re- 
cently been named as hierarchical zeolites. Generally, zeolite cata- 
lysts having hierarchical porosity with at least two different types 
of  pores  are  referred  to  as  hierarchical  catalysts  [232 , 319] .  Be- 
sides the typical uniform micropores, there is a secondary poros- 
ity  in  which  different  pores  extending  from  supermicropores  to 
mesopores and even macropores can be observed. In most cases, 
secondary  porosity  contains  pores  within  mesopore  range  de- 
pending  on  the  synthesis  strategy.  There  exist  different  strate- 
gies for preparing hierarchical zeolites, such as removal of frame- 
work atoms (desilication, dealumination and irradiation), templat- 
ing  with  surfactants,  hard-templating,  zeolitization  of  preformed 
solids,  silanization-based  methods  as  well  as  mixed  approaches 
[320] . Different synthesis approaches for hierarchical catalysts ap- 
plied in catalytic pyrolysis in the last years are listed in Table 2 . 
It can be noted that desilication, dealumination, templating with 

surfactants  and  chemical  liquid  deposition  (CLD)  are  the  most 
widespread routes for producing hierarchical zeolites. 

8.3.1. Dealumination 

Dealumination  is  another  post-synthesis  treatment  for  zeolite 
catalysts. In earlier times, a dealumination process was introduced 
to increase the Si/Al ratio. Dealumination process can be carried 
out  by  hydrothermal  treatment  and  using  chemicals.  In  the  hy- 
drothermal  treatment,  steam  at  relatively  high  temperatures  be- 
tween 500 and 600 °C is applied for removal of structural/extra- 
framework aluminum. Hydrothermal dealumination starts with the 
breaking of Al-O bond due to the less electropositive nature of Al 
than Si. Upon the cleavage of Al-O, water molecule undergoes tri- 
coordination and forms an Al-OH group. The proton formed from 
the  hydrolysis  of  water  further  attaches  with  remaining  Al-O-Si, 
however, rapid cleavage of Al-O bonds leads to the formation of 
Si-OH. Hence, four Si-OH groups are generated from the complete 
removal of one Al [326] . Hydrothermal treatment causes a reduc- 
tion in the surface area, pore size and total acid sites of HZSM- 
5 which restricts coke formation on the catalyst surface. HZSM-5 
was hydrothermally treated with 20% steam at 450, 500 and 550 
°C for catalytic fast pyrolysis of corn stalk [327] . It has been re- 
ported that the selectivity of different valuable chemicals increased 
with increasing of hydrothermal treatment temperature. HZSM-5 
treated at 550 °C remarkably decreased the phenol content to pro- 
duce toluene and xylene aromatics. 

On the other hand, several chemicals, for example, HCl, HNO

Alkaline treatment creates some

Desilication with Na 2 CO 3 is more 
controllable. 
Both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites 
increase while the concentration of 
Lewis acid site is apparently more. 
The addition of CTAB introduces 
mesopores into the structure. 
The mesopore and total surface area 
increase, whereas the micropore

Hierarchical catalysts are found with 
improved hydrothermal stability. 

A hierarchical porous system including 
mesopores and even macropores is 
found for alkali treatment with the 
exception of TPAOH 0.2M. 
The effect of TPAOH in forming 
hierarchical structure is negligible. 
The Bronsted acid sites decrease 
dramatically with an increased 
number of Lewis acid sites for NaOH, 
whereas the total number of acid sites 
slightly increases with Na 2 CO 3 and 
decreases with TPAOH treatment.

In the presence of surfactant, silica is 
removed due to desilication process 
and further recrystallized at the 
surface leading to external terminal 
silanol groups. 
Despite the addition of surfactant, 
severe desilication results in a 
decrease in crystallinity of zeolite. 
The BET surface and pore volume 
increase but the total number of acid 
sites decreases. 
Deposition of SiO 2 around small pores 
increases pore diameter and decreases 
both BET surface area and pore 
volume. 
Dealumination using acid removes 
some acid sites on the surface but 
increases the total number of acid 
sites. 
The BET surface area, pore volume 
and pore diameter of catalysts are 
signiﬁcantly higher with 
dealumination. 

Higher activation energy is found for 
hierarchical ZSM-5. 
The yield of phenol decreases 
signiﬁcantly. 
Hierarchical HZSM signiﬁcantly 
increases the monoaromatic 
hydrocarbons.

Hierarchical catalysts with excessive 
templating increase coke formation. 

[281] 

Modiﬁed catalysts show better 
catalytic performances in methanol to 
hydrocarbon conversion. 
The aromatic yield is increased and 
coke formation is decreased over 
Na 2 CO 3 -treated zeolites under the 
same conditions compared to NaOH 
and TAPOH. 
The Na 2 CO 3 -treated zeolites are most 
effective in the conversion of 
cellulose-derived oxygenates to 
aromatics. 

The increased mesopores in 
dealuminated zeolites improve the 
accessibility of highly active sites and 
thus enhance the production of 
hydrocarbons. 
Desilication post-synthesis enhances 
the mass transfer inside the zeolite 
framework and the accessibility of 
strong Bronsted acid sites in 
micropores. 
Desilicated zeolites are more selective 
to monoaromatics. 
The formation of mesopores with 
preserved crystallinity and 
microporosity relieves the diffusion 
limitation of large molecules and 
enhances catalytic activity. 
Mesoporous MFI catalysts with mild 
desilication increase the aromatic 
yield with a lower fraction of coke 
and char.

Both post-synthesis approaches boost 
the hydrocarbon yield in comparison

H

ﬁed HZSM-5 by several leaching agents, like HNO 
4 , 5- 
sulfosalicylic acid, oxalic acid, and tartaric acid for catalytic conver- 
sion of biomass-derived oxygenates to oleﬁn and aromatics [329] . 
Modiﬁed catalyst treated with 2 M of H 
4 acid was found more 
effective to decrease coke formation by 16.7% compared with par- 
ent ZSM-5. The H 
4 -modiﬁed HZSM-5 results in the maximum 
yield of oleﬁn 13.9% and aromatics 31.8% in comparison to ZSM-5 
catalyst  (9.8%  and  24.5%,  respectively).  Recently,  acid  dealumina- 
tion of ZSM-5 was studied with different concentrations of H 
3 PO

(0.5-8 M) for catalytic fast pyrolysis of pinewood sawdust [325] . 
The  ZSM-5  treated  with  1  M  H 
4  boosted  the  production  of 
benzene, toluene and xylene by 1.58, 1.47 and 1.1 times than the 
values over parent ZSM-5, respectively. Removal of superﬁcial acid 
sites from acid-treated ZSM-5 was reported to inhibit further de- 
hydration and hydrogen transfer reactions, thus reducing coke pro- 
duction.

Though  dealumination  increases  the  catalytic  activity  better 
than  parent  zeolites,  excessive  damage  of  micropores  and  crys- 
talline structure with severe treatment conditions is a constraint 
for catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapor. Thus, it is necessary to 
explore alternative routes for generating hierarchical zeolites [27] . 

8.3.2. Desilication/Post-synthesis alkaline treatment 

2 CO 

Among the post-synthesis treatments, selective removal of sili- 
con from the framework is the most versatile method which gener- 
ates mesopores at the expense of micropores. This results in reduc- 
ing the diffusion limitation of large molecules and increasing the 
accessibility of acid sites in micropores [328 , 330] . Coke precursors 
can easily diffuse out of the micropores due to the interconnection 
of mesopores with micropores, resulting in a lower coke formation 
over desilicated zeolites. For alkaline treatment of zeolite catalysts, 
a number of alkaline solutions, such as NaOH, Na 
3 , tetrapropy- 
lammonium hydroxide (TPAOH), and tetrabutylammonium hydrox- 
ide with different concentrations have been applied in last several 
years [331] . Microporous ZSM-5 and H- β were treated with NaOH 
in order to prepare hierarchical mesoporous catalysts, which were 
used in catalytic pyrolysis of wood polymer composites [332] . Hier- 
archical H- β was found to reduce diffusivity and increase cracking 
reactions due to its pore size and a larger number of acid sites, 
however, not shape selective for aromatization. Hierarchical ZSM- 
5  had  a  longer  lifetime  and  showed  the  best  eﬃciency  to  pro- 
duce a larger amount of hydrocarbon because of the presence of 
mesopores, appropriate shape selectivity and strong acidity. Large 
molecular oxygenates, for example, phenol, guaiacol, and syringol 
released from lignin easily diffuse and are cracked into newly gen- 
erated  mesopores,  and  some  oxygenates  are  pre-cracked  on  the 
surface  of  acid  sites  and  then  diffuse  into  micropores  of  desili- 
cated  HZSM-5  for  further  aromatization  [319] .  Thus,  newly  gen- 
erated  mesopores  reduce  the  diffusion  limitation  to  bulky  oxy- 
genates  and  improve  the  catalytic  pyrolysis  to  produce  aromatic 
compounds and smaller oxygen content. 

The  substantial  loss  of  crystallinity  and  micropores  leads  to 
extra-framework deposition of aluminum and alteration of Bron- 
sted acid sites, and therefore increases the number of Lewis acid 
sites [330] . On the other hand, deposition of extra-framework sub- 
stance inside the micropores is attributed to the slight drop of mi- 
cropores  [144 , 304] .  However,  excessive  desilication  may  increase 
the loss of crystallinity, introducing heterogeneous mesopores that 
are  unexpected  due  to  lower  catalytic  activity  [93 , 331 , 333] .  The 
study of desilication in the presence of surfactant shows that sil- 
ica removal through alkaline treatment recrystallizes at the surface 
and  forms  external  terminal  silanol  groups  [323 , 333] .  Although 
alkylation  is  straight-forward,  scalable  and  economically  feasible 

[92] , mild and controlled desilication process with minimum loss 
of crystallinity, higher external surface area, generation of uniform 
mesopores and its regular distribution could be eﬃcient for cat- 
alytic cracking and upgrading. 

8.3.3. Surface templating and chemical liquid deposition 

Templating of catalyst surface is a much more eﬃcient technol- 
ogy for introducing hierarchical catalysts, although there is a prob- 
lem with structural damage due to demetalation treatment. Soft 
templating with surfactant has gained much attention as it leads 
to a desired core/shell structure with high hydrothermal stability 
and better catalytic property due to unique acidic property [334- 
337] .  In  the  early  period  of  templating  (1-3  h),  six  coordinated 
extra-framework  Al  species  are  transformed  into  tetrahedral  co- 
ordinated Al species, which increases the Si/Al ratio. Furthermore, 
templating sharply reduces the BET surface area due to lower mi- 
croporous content in the modiﬁed catalyst [321] . Compared to the 
desilication process, templating with mesopore material results in 
mesoporous structure while the introduction of a certain number 
of CTAB into bare HZSM-5 was found to increase the aromatic yield 
by 3.2 % and decrease the coke yield by 5.9 % [281] . However, ex- 
cessive templating is thought to lower the total acid sites and dam- 
age the crystal structure, leading to relatively lower aromatic yields 
with a higher coke deposition. 

Chemical liquid deposition or CLD is an external surface modi- 
ﬁcation technique that is usually used to narrow pore opening size 
and decrease surface acid sites and therefore, CLD increases shape 
selectivity of catalysts [220] . A modiﬁer with higher molecular di- 
ameter, for example, KH550 is used in a CLD process, which de- 
posits  on  the  surface  of  catalysts.  As  a  consequence  of  covering 
the external acid sites, the yield of coke precursors (indene and 
naphthalene) decreased over CLD-treated ZSM-5 [325] . Dai et al. 
reported that the CLD process reduces the pore opening due to the 
coating of SiO 
2 near the pore mouth and also reduces the meso- 
pore  volume  and  the  number  of  external  acid  sites  without  af- 
fecting the micropore structure of HZSM-5 [338] . The authors also 
2  on the surface showed the 
found that the deposition of 4% SiO 
optimal performance for the production of aromatics with the best 
coke inhibitory effects [338] . Another study of catalytic fast pyroly- 
sis over chemical vapor deposition modiﬁed HZSM-5 revealed that 
coke gradually decreased, but the bio-oil fraction decreased ﬁrst 
and  then  increased  to  maximum  of  22.6%  when  the  amount  of 
SiO 
2 deposition increased up to 5.9% [339] . Excess CLD treatment 
causes the pore opening blockage and prevents cracking reactions 
causing  the high amount  of  oxygen-containing species in bio-oil 
[340] . 

Strategies  to  develop  a  hierarchical  catalyst  induce  different 
characteristics  on  the  modiﬁed  catalysts.  For  example,  the  desil- 
ication approach creates mesopores and increases the Lewis acid 
site,  whereas  dealumination  lowers  the  Lewis  acid  site  without 
changing the crystallinity. On the other hand, surface templating 
increases hydrothermal stability. Alkali treatment is widely used to 
prepare hierarchical catalysts, whereas CLD narrows the pore open- 
ing. It is diﬃcult to note the supremacy of one strategy compared 
to another. However, soft templating with surfactant has better po- 
tentials than the other hierarchical strategies based on structure 
conservation and lower coke formation on the surface. 

8.4. Multi-functional catalyst 

Catalytic  pyrolysis  with  bifunctional  and  hierarchical  catalysts 
promotes the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons, however, bio-oil 
still exerts unfavorable characteristics for direct application. In ad- 
dition, a number of structural and chemical issues of modiﬁed cat- 
alysts constitute major concerns in both pyrolysis and the upgrad- 
ing process. Therefore, the development and application of multi- 

26

functional catalysts would have potential in the petrochemical in- 
dustry. 

Considering the potential characteristics of metals, Ni promotes 
the  formation  of  monoaromatic  hydrocarbons  and  Fe  suppresses 
the  repolymerization  of  monoaromatics  leading  to  a  lower  coke 
formation,  a  multi-functional  co-doped  Fe-Ni/ZSM-5  catalyst  has 
been developed [290] . The surface acidity of co-doped Fe/Ni cat- 
alyst mainly reﬂects the characteristics of Ni/ZSM-5, and the com- 
bined effect of Ni and Fe results in higher aromatic hydrocarbon 
and moderate coke yield. It is noteworthy that the combined ef- 
fect of metals is not always prominent, and even a multi-functional 
catalyst (Zn-Ga/ZSM-5) can show less selectivity to aromatic hy- 
drocarbons than parent catalysts, whereas the synergistic loading 
of Co and Zn promotes catalytic activity of Zn-Co/ZSM-5 and in- 
creases the BTX yield [294] . Similarly, multi-functional catalyst (Ni- 
Ce/HZSM-5) was prepared using various proportions of Ni and Ce 
metals and evaluated based on the production of C 
8 hydrocar- 
bons in bio-oil from sugarcane bagasse [293] . The least reduction 
in  BET  surface  area  and  acidity  was  observed  at  an  equal  mass 
of Ni and Ce on HZSM-5 catalysts denoted by NC3. Despite hav- 
ing high coke formation, the hydrocarbon yield is relatively higher 
with NC3 catalysts compared to parent and other modiﬁed cata- 
lysts. 

6 -C 

In  the  production  of  metal  loaded  multi-functional  catalysts 
through the conventional wet impregnation method, metal cations 
are adsorbed on the acid sites of zeolite that might be a reason for 
low catalytic activity. In this regard, a unique method of physical 
sputtering allows doping of metals or metal oxides on catalyst sur- 
faces which results in highly selective and a multi-functional cata- 
lyst [341] . Kantarelis et al. prepared nickel-vanadium (Ni-V) loaded 
multi-functional  zeolite  following  agglomeration  of  catalyst  with 
bentonite binder, HCl treatment and metal doping by dry impreg- 
nation  technique  [342] .  Results  revealed  that  most  of  the  metal 
cations are located on the surface and a fraction is diffused into the 
zeolite channel. The combination of Ni-V and HZSM-5 was found 
to increase the catalytic activity toward the production of deoxy- 
genated  pyrolysis  liquid  with  increased  hydrogen  content  [342] . 
Furthermore, metal encapsulation within zeolite structure has been 
proposed as a plausible approach to produce metal-zeolites as well 
as multi-functional metal-zeolite in terms of higher catalytic ac- 
tivity, higher metal accessibility and prolong life-span for catalytic 
fast pyrolysis [343] . 

From  the  above  studies,  it  can  be  noted  that  synergistic  and 
combined  effects  of  metals  on  the  carbon-carbon  coupling  re- 
actions  should  be  studied  prior  to  application  of  metal  loaded 
multi-functional catalysts. In addition, transition metals can be in- 
corporated  into  hierarchical  catalysts  in  order  to  prepare  multi- 
functional catalysts for catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass. 

9. Economic outlook of catalytic pyrolysis of biomass 

Estimating the economic feasibility of a bioreﬁnery process for 
given market conditions helps to ﬁgure out the risk factors for its 
commercialization. A number of studies have been focused on the 
techno-economic  assessment  of  pyrolysis,  catalytic  pyrolysis,  hy- 
drotreating and catalytic cracking of bio-oil, and bio-oil stabiliza- 
tion for petroleum reﬁneries [344-346] . Thus, this section focuses 
on the economic analysis of catalytic pyrolysis of biomass. 

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the main inﬂuenc- 
ing parameters of a techno-economic analysis of catalytic pyrolysis 
include internal rate of return, feedstock cost, total capital invest- 
ment, product yield, plant size, catalytic pyrolysis reactor, electric- 
ity input and income tax rate [347] . The total installation cost is 
calculated by applying installation factors to basic equipment costs, 
which are derived from vendors, engineering consultants and the 
Aspen Capital Cost Estimator (ACCE). Variable costs depend on ma- 

terials  and  energy  use,  while  ﬁxed  costs  are  based  on  expendi- 
tures. The minimum selling price of bio-oil can be calculated by 
a discount cash ﬂow analysis [347] . A conceptual process of ex- 
situ catalytic process in a ﬁxed bed reactor was designed to eval- 
uate the effects of conﬁguration on bioreﬁnery economics [348] . 
The addition of a hot gas ﬁlter to a ﬁxed bed reactor increases the 
total capital cost, but can be minimized by catalyst cost as it re- 
quires decreased catalyst replacement than a ﬂuidized reactor sys- 
tem.  The  ﬂexibility  of  catalysts  in a  ﬁxed  bed  reactor  is  consid- 
ered to provide better control over reaction chemistry and product 
composition. It has been highlighted that pyrolysis plant size, in- 
ternal rate of return and biomass cost have the greatest impacts 
on the minimum selling price of bio-oil [62] . The 40% reduction 
in the installed cost of the pyrolysis unit with a capacity of 20 0 0 
metric ton (MT) dry biomass/day results in a 10% reduction in the 
minimum fuel-selling price of bio-oil [349] . It has also been deter- 
mined that an increase in total plant cost by 40% results in a 5% 
increase in the minimum selling price of bio-oil. A study focused 
on the techno-economic analysis of catalytic pyrolysis of biomass 
for a 20 0 0 MT biomass/day facility estimated that 45% of the min- 
imum fuel-selling price is derived from the cost of raw biomass 
when the internal rate of return was assumed at 10% [350] . 

Therefore, biomass with high moisture content can be expected 
to  increase  the  operating  cost  along  with  the  minimum  selling 
price of bio-oil. For example, microalgae with 80% moisture were 
used in the techno-economic analysis of bio-oil production from 
two catalytic pyrolysis pathways; one is thermal drying and an- 
other  is  partial  mechanical  dewatering  prior  to  catalytic  pyroly- 
sis with a facility of 20 0 0 MT biomass/day [351] . The operational 
cost of thermal drying catalytic pyrolysis was 145.8 $ million/year, 
which was 25 $ million higher than that of a mechanical dewater- 
ing catalytic process due to the high cost of natural gas used for 
drying. On the other hand, a generation unit incorporated in the 
mechanical dewatering catalytic process results in a higher capi- 
tal cost by 63 $ million than thermal drying catalytic process of 
346 $ million. However, the minimum selling price of bio-oil was 
calculated to be 1.80 $/L and 1.49 $/L for thermal drying catalytic 
pyrolysis and partial mechanical dewatering catalytic pyrolysis, re- 
spectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that a 20% variation in the 
bio-oil  yield  has  a  signiﬁcant  effect  on  bio-oil  selling  price,  and 
therefore, a 20% increase in bio-oil yield lowers the selling price to 
1.51 $/L and 1.21 $/L for thermal drying catalytic pyrolysis and par- 
tial mechanical dewatering catalytic pyrolysis, respectively [351] . 

Vasalos et al. carried out an economic analysis of beechwood 
catalytic pyrolysis operated in a circulating ﬂuid bed with a capac- 
ity of 500 MT dry biomass/day where a total investment cost was 
calculated at 78.55 $ million and the linear depreciation was 20 
years [352] . The production cost on the basis of catalyst to biomass 
ratio of 16 was estimated to be 615 $/MT or 0.54 $/L (2.05 $/gallon) 
of bio-oil with 18 wt.% oxygen. The feedstock price had a domi- 
nant impact on the bio-oil production cost . For example, increas- 
ing feedstock price from 57 $/MT to 114 $/MT leads to higher pro- 
duction cost from 615 $/MT to 841 $/MT. It has been calculated 
that a twofold increase in plant capacity to 10 0 0 MT/day decreases 
the production cost by 43 $/MT. Catalyst usage in the pyrolysis pro- 
cess also has a major impact on the bio-oil production cost. For 
example, a fourfold increase of ZSM-5 results in higher bio-oil pro- 
duction cost by 169 $/MT. In order to address the economic un- 
certainty of catalytic pyrolysis, the best-ﬁt distribution and Monte 
Carlo methods were employed in the techno-economic analysis of 
in-situ and ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis [345] . It has been found that 
the minimum selling prices of bio-oil from the in-situ and ex-situ 
processes are 1.11 $/L with a standard deviation of 0.29 and 1.13 
$/L with a standard deviation of 0.21, respectively. According to the 
uncertainty study, feedstock price, electricity cost, total project in- 
vestment, internal rate of return, bio-oil and char yield are crucial 

R. Liu, M. Sarker and Md.M. Rahman et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 80 (2020) 100852 

27 

factors that inﬂuence the selling price of bio-oil in both in-situ and 
ex-situ reaction modes. Although the longer lifespan of a catalyst 
lowers the bio-oil production cost due to the reduction of catalyst 
replacement cost, the bio-oil yield has a dominant impact on the 
minimum selling price among all the inﬂuencing parameters. Stud- 
ies have also reported that ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis possesses a 
lower techno-economic uncertainty than the in-situ process and is 
suggested to mitigate the commercialization uncertainty for bio-oil 
production. 

From the above study, it can be concluded that the main fo- 
cusing points for commercial production of bio-oil from catalytic 
pyrolysis of biomass include: (1) low-cost biomass, (2) high bio-oil 
yield, (3) production capacity, and (4) inexpensive catalysts. 

10. Conclusion and future perspective 

10.1. Conclusion 

Acidic zeolite is one of the most used catalysts for the valoriza- 
tion of biomass to produce bio-oil. In addition to zeolites, other 
mesoporous catalysts and some low-cost materials have been stud- 
ied as catalysts in biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis. In this review, 
shape selectivity of acid catalysts, reaction chemistry in biomass 
catalytic fast pyrolysis, process complexity with acid catalysts and 
different catalyst modiﬁcation approaches to address the complex- 
ity have been presented in detail. A major challenge in the in-situ 
catalytic pyrolysis is quick deactivation of acid catalyst, which has 
a great impact on bio-oil quality and increases bio-oil production 
cost  due  to  the  replacement  of  spent  catalysts.  In  contrast,  the 
ex-situ conﬁguration provides better control and ﬂexibility in the 
upgrading of bio-oil when the operating conditions can be opti- 
mized individually. However, there is a linear relationship between 
structural complexity and catalyst deactivation. Diffusional limita- 
tion promotes the formation and deposition of coke on the surface 
of acid sites, leading to lower catalytic activity and results in cata- 
lyst deactivation. A higher amount of coke formation instead of hy- 
drocarbons and excessive cracking of volatiles during catalytic py- 
rolysis of biomass are causes for a lower yield of bio-oil with an in- 
suﬃcient amount of hydrocarbons. In the catalyst modiﬁcation, the 
synergistic effect of metal and solid acid catalyst promotes catalysis 
reactions in comparison to parent catalysts. Similarly, various metal 
oxides can be impregnated to prepare bifunctional catalysts for cat- 
alytic fast pyrolysis. Deposited metal oxides improve catalytic per- 
formance by creating Lewis acid sites and avoid excessive crack- 
ing of vapors, leading to a higher fraction of organic compounds 
with low amount of undesired PAHs. The hierarchical catalyst com- 
bines micro- and mesoporosity in which mesopores reduce diffu- 
sion limitation as larger oxygenates can easily access active sites 
on the micropores and thus, increase the selectivity of hydrocar- 
bons. In addition to bifunctional catalysts, some studies on metal 
loaded multi-functional catalysts revealed that in most cases, com- 
bination of metals increases the total acid sites and plays a crucial 
role in generating a higher yield of hydrocarbon in bio-oil. Multi- 
scale complexities of solid acid catalysts, including structural com- 
plexity,  inappropriate  acidity,  and  deactivation,  affect  the  quality 
and yield of bio-oil, however, after appropriate modiﬁcation, solid 
acid catalysts can exhibit better catalytic performance for aromati- 
zation, high thermal stability, and shape selectivity in catalytic fast 
pyrolysis of biomass. 

10.2. Future perspective 

In spite of huge progress in catalyst modiﬁcation and catalytic 
fast pyrolysis of biomass, signiﬁcant challenges still exist for the 
production of fuel-grade bio-oil. Some recommendations are sug- 
gested for the production of high-grade fuels and chemicals: 

(1) In the in-situ conﬁguration, some oxygenating species evolve at 
low temperature and leave the catalyst before pyrolysis tem- 
perature is reached. Quick deactivation of catalyst by coke de- 
position is another constraint of in-situ conﬁguration. From the 
point of selectivity to monoaromatics, improved quality of bio- 
oil and better control with ﬂexibility, an ex-situ conﬁguration 
is  suggested  for  further  studies  in  catalytic  fast  pyrolysis  of 
biomass. 

(2) Microporous  structure  induces  diffusion  limitations  for  large 
molecules and promotes secondary reactions of oleﬁns, small 
oxygenates, and aromatic oxygenates, that are typical coke pre- 
cursors.  The  study  regarding  kinetic  diameter  of  the  desired 
product is required before tuning the porosity of acid catalysts. 
(3)  Single-step oxidative regeneration treatment might be an un- 
derlying reason for hot-spots due to the exothermic oxidation 
of cokes at high temperature. As a result, lower catalytic activ- 
ity and even permanent damage could occur through sintering 
and dealumination. A two- or multi-step regeneration process 
is suggested for restoring properties of spent catalysts. 

(4) The potentials of bifunctional catalysts for pyrolysis are widely 
studied, but very little research is found regarding metal loaded 
multi-functional catalysts. The development of multi-functional 
catalysts by impregnating metal or metal oxides on hierarchical 
catalysts could provide beneﬁts in the petrochemical industry.
