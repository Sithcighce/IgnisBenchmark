---

## 📋 What Was Done

### 1. **New Generator Created**: `milestone1_compare_generator.py`

This is an enhanced version with the following improvements:

#### ✨ Key Features:
- **English Prompts**: Translated both generation and quality check prompts from Chinese to English
- **Iterative Quality Loop**: Automatically checks quality and regenerates if needed
- **90% Acceptance Threshold**: Only delivers results when ≥90% questions pass quality check
- **Maximum 3 Iterations**: Prevents infinite loops
- **Detailed Quality Metrics**: Comprehensive reporting on acceptance rates

## 🔄 How It Works

```
1. Load Paper
    ↓
2. Generate 20 Questions (using improved English prompt)
    ↓
3. Quality Check Each Question (using English quality prompt)
    ↓
4. Calculate Acceptance Rate
    ↓
5. If ≥90% → DELIVER ✅
   If <90% → Analyze issues → Refine prompt → Go to Step 2
```

| Feature | Original (`milestone1_generator.py`) | New (`milestone1_compare_generator.py`) |
|---------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Language | Chinese prompts | **English prompts** |
| Quality Check | Manual review needed | **Automated quality checking** |
| Iterations | Single attempt | **Up to 3 iterations with feedback** |
| Acceptance Threshold | None | **≥90% required** |
| Quality Metadata | Not included | **Included in each question** |
| Feedback Loop | No | **Yes - improves on failure** |

## 💡 Key Improvements

### 1. **Translated Prompts** (from `新prompt.md` and `质量检查prompt.md`):
   - Generation prompt: Comprehensive English instructions for creating high-quality questions
   - Quality check prompt: Strict English criteria for validating questions

### 2. **Quality Check Criteria**:
   - ❌ Rejects paper meta-information questions
   - ❌ Rejects time-sensitive questions
   - ❌ Rejects too open-ended questions
   - ❌ Rejects shallow definition questions
   - ✅ Passes questions with clear mechanisms and determinable answers

### 3. **Iterative Improvement**:
   - If acceptance rate < 90%, analyzes common issues
   - Generates feedback for the next iteration
   - Refines generation prompt based on feedback
   - Continues until threshold is met or max iterations reached

## 🎓 Sample Generated Questions

### Question 1 (Reasoning, Difficulty 4):
**Q**: Why does increasing pressure shorten ignition delay time in combustion systems? Explain from molecular collision and chemical kinetics perspectives.

**A**: Increased pressure raises molecular number density, causing collision frequency to increase proportionally with pressure. According to Arrhenius law, reaction rate k is proportional to collision frequency and activation energy exponential term. At high pressure, elementary reaction rates accelerate, chain reactions progress faster, leading to shortened ignition delay time τ. The quantitative relationship is τ ∝ P^(-n), where n depends on reaction mechanism, typically between 1-2.

**Quality Check**: ✅ PASS - No issues

---

### Question 2 (Concept, Difficulty 3):
**Q**: What are the fundamental differences between laminar flame speed and turbulent flame speed in combustion systems? Which one dominates in practical IC engine applications?

**A**: Laminar flame speed is a fundamental thermochemical property representing the propagation velocity of a flat flame front relative to unburned mixture under quiescent conditions. Turbulent flame speed incorporates effects of turbulence-enhanced mixing and flame wrinkling, typically being much higher than laminar speed. In IC engines, turbulent flame speed dominates due to high Reynolds numbers generating intense turbulence.

**Quality Check**: ✅ PASS - No issues

---

### Question 3 (Calculation, Difficulty 3):
**Q**: Calculate the laminar flame speed of methane-air mixture (φ=1.0) at 600K, 10atm given its reference speed is 0.4m/s at 300K, 1atm. Use the correlation SL ∝ T^α P^β with α≈2, β≈-0.5.

**A**: SL_new = SL_ref × (T_new/T_ref)^α × (P_new/P_ref)^β = 0.4 × (600/300)^2 × (10/1)^(-0.5) = 0.4 × 4 × 0.316 ≈ 0.5 m/s

**Quality Check**: ✅ PASS - No issues

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run the generator:
```bash
python milestone1_compare_generator.py
```

### Configuration (in `config.yaml` or override in code):
```python
m1_compare_config = {
    "generation_model": "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash",
    "quality_check_model": "gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    "paper_path": "main.txt",
    "output_path": "data/milestone1_compare.jsonl",
    "report_path": "data/milestone1_compare_report.md",
    "max_iterations": 3,
    "acceptance_threshold": 0.90
}
```
