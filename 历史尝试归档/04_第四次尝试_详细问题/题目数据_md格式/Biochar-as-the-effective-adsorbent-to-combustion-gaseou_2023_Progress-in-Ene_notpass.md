## Question 1

### 问题

Derive the Langmuir isotherm model for SO2 adsorption on biochar considering both physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms, and explain how nitrogen functionalization alters the adsorption parameters.

### 标准答案

The Langmuir isotherm combines physisorption (θ_phy) and chemisorption (θ_chem) terms: θ_total = θ_phy + θ_chem = (b_phy·P)/(1+b_phy·P) + (b_chem·P)/(1+b_chem·P), where b represents adsorption affinity constants. For plain biochar, physisorption dominates (high b_phy from micropores) while chemisorption is negligible. Nitrogen functionalization introduces basic sites via reactions like R2CH3N + SO2 + ½O2 + H2O → (R2CH3NH)2·SO4, increasing b_chem dramatically. The modified isotherm becomes θ_total' = (b_phy·P)/(1+b_phy·P) + (b_chem'·P)/(1+b_chem'·P), where b_chem' >> b_chem. At high temperatures (>100°C), the physisorption term diminishes (exothermic), making chemisorption dominant as observed experimentally with MDEA-modified biochar showing 156.22 mg/g capacity at 100°C.

### 原文引用

**引用 1**:
> The adsorption capacity of SO2 by unmodified biochar is generally at a low amount of less than 20 mg_SO2/g_biochar

**引用 2**:
> The MDEA mass concentration was added to 1% and 4%, the deteriorated pore structure significantly destroyed the adsorption of SO2 compared with biocharCO2

### 质量检查

- **领域聚焦**: ✅ 通过
- **答案正确性**: ❌ 未通过
- **其他合规性**: ❌ 未通过
- **总体评价**: fail

**领域聚焦分析**: The question requires expertise in adsorption mechanisms, surface chemistry, and biochar modification, which are core topics in combustion/energy research.

**答案问题**: fundamental_error, unsupported

**改进建议**: Revise the Langmuir derivation to clarify that physisorption and chemisorption cannot be simply additive (they compete for sites). Replace speculative claims (e.g., '156.22 mg/g at 100°C') with explicitly cited data from the provided references.
