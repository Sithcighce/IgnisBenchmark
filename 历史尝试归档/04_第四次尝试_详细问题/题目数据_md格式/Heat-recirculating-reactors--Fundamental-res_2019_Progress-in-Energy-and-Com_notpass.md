## Question 1

### 问题

In the context of heat recirculating reactors, particularly two-section porous media burners, why are the maximum temperatures often subadiabatic despite significant burning rate enhancements? Analyze the underlying physical mechanisms and their mathematical representations, emphasizing the roles of heat recirculation, external heat losses, and the Damköhler number in determining whether superadiabatic temperatures can be achieved. Provide a detailed explanation of the governing heat transfer processes and chemical kinetics involved.

### 标准答案

The observation of subadiabatic maximum temperatures in two-section porous media burners occurs even with burning rate enhancements because the reactor operates under conditions where external heat losses are significant. Although internal heat recirculation preheats the reactants, leading to higher reaction rates and thus increased burning velocities, the overall energy balance is constrained by the first law of thermodynamics. In a two-section burner, the upstream section with small pores (d < d_q) acts as a flame arrestor. The heat recirculation process involves convective heat transfer from hot combustion products to the solid matrix, followed by upstream conduction and radiation through the solid. This recirculated heat elevates the reactant temperature upstream of the reaction zone, which increases the reaction rate and allows for stabilization at higher flow rates. However, external heat losses through the reactor boundaries remove energy from the system. Consequently, the peak temperature T_max is less than the adiabatic flame temperature T_ad, resulting in a dimensionless temperature ̃T = T_max/T_ad < 1. The key parameters are the dimensionless heat loss ratio ̃H = h_E A_E / h_I A_I, which should be minimized for optimal performance. Even with effective internal recirculation, if ̃H is too large, the heat losses overwhelm the heat release, preventing superadiabatic conditions. The Damköhler number Da = τ_f / τ_c = L/U / τ_c must be greater than 1 for flame stabilization, but it does not guarantee T_max > T_ad because the recirculated energy is ultimately subject to dissipation. The mathematical relationship for the temperature increase (ΔT) in a propagating front (as in filtration combustion) is given by ΔT = ΔT_ad / (1 - u_w / u_t), where u_w is the combustion front velocity and u_t is the thermal front velocity. For a stationary front (u_w = 0), ΔT equals ΔT_ad. However, in a two-section burner, the flame is stabilized, so propagation velocity u_w = 0, and thus ΔT = ΔT_ad, meaning no superadiabatic effect. In contrast, superadiabatic temperatures (̃T > 1) are possible when u_w and u_t are co-current and close in magnitude, but in practice, external losses reduce T_max below T_ad, even with substantial heat recirculation, as shown in experimental results where T_max < 1750 K for φ = 0.65 (T_ad ≈ 1750 K). Thus, the balance between internal recirculation and external losses dictates that maximum temperatures remain subadiabatic in many practical designs despite burning rate enhancements.

## Question 2

### 问题

For a counter-flow channel reactor operating on a lean methane/air mixture at equivalence ratio φ = 0.5, estimate the ratio of burning velocity to laminar flame speed ̃U = U / S_L. The adiabatic laminar flame speed S_L for methane/air at φ = 0.5 is approximately 12 cm/s. If the maximum inlet velocity measured is 125 cm/s, calculate the enhancement factor. Discuss how the transverse heat transfer through the walls influences this enhancement and the flame stabilization mechanism, referencing the relevant dimensionless parameters like Biot number B and heat transfer intensity χ.

### 标准答案

The ratio of burning velocity to laminar flame speed ̃U is a direct measure of combustion enhancement. Given the laminar flame speed S_L ≈ 12 cm/s and the maximum inlet velocity U_in = 125 cm/s, then ̃U = U_in / S_L = 125 / 12 ≈ 10.42. This substantial enhancement is primarily due to the transverse heat transfer from hot combustion products in one channel through the separating wall to the cold reactants in the adjacent channel, which is the dominant heat transfer mode in counter-flow reactors. The flame speed enhancement is driven by the intense convective heat exchange between the gases and the solid walls. The dimensionless Biot number B = h_I L_c / k_s, where for a counter-flow reactor, the characteristic length L_c might be 2L^2/t, where L is the channel length and t is the wall thickness. A high B indicates that convective heat transfer dominates over solid conduction, which is beneficial in this configuration because it facilitates efficient preheating of the incoming reactants. In the model by Ju and Choi, the heat transfer intensity χ is a scale factor for convective heat transfer. When χ increases, the heat recirculation becomes more effective, leading to higher ̃U values. Additionally, the heat loss at extinction κ increases with χ. For example, as χ increases from 0.0 to 1.0, the flame temperature increases by ~75% and ̃U reaches >6. In this specific case, with U_in = 125 cm/s and S_L = 12 cm/s, the enhancement factor ̃U ≈ 10.42. This is significantly higher than in unidirectional reactors, underscoring the importance of transverse interfacial heat transfer. The mathematical representation of this effect can be derived from the energy balance, considering the transverse heat flux q_trans ∝ χ (T_hot - T_cold), which directly increases the reactant temperature and thus the reaction rate, allowing stabilization at velocities far exceeding the laminar flame speed.

## Question 3

### 问题

Discuss the differences in flame stabilization mechanisms between unidirectional flow reactors (e.g., two-section porous burners) and counter-flow reactors (e.g., Swiss roll combustors). Explain how the flow configuration (co-flow vs. counter-flow) affects the dominant heat transfer pathways (axial conduction vs. transverse convection) and their impact on operating range and superadiabatic potential. Use specific examples from the paper, such as the role of the quenching Peclet number Pe_q and the Biot number B for each design. Provide a detailed analysis of the underlying physics, including the roles of the Damköhler number Da and the dimensionless heat loss ratio ̃H.

### 标准答案

Unidirectional flow reactors, such as the two-section porous burner, rely primarily on axial heat transfer through the solid matrix for recirculation. In these reactors, heat is transferred upstream via conduction and radiation in the solid. The flame stabilizes at the interface between the two sections due to the pore size difference. The upstream section has small pores (d < d_q) such that Pe < Pe_q, which prevents upstream flame propagation. The flame is thus anchored at a fixed position, and the stabilization is sensitive to external heat losses, as indicated by ̃H. For stable operation, Da must be greater than 1. However, external losses can be significant, limiting the operating range and typically resulting in subadiabatic temperatures because the heat recirculation is counteracted by losses. In contrast, counter-flow reactors, like the Swiss roll, utilize transverse heat transfer through the walls separating adjacent channels. This provides an additional heat recirculation mechanism, where hot products in one channel heat the reactants in the neighboring channel through convection. This transverse heat transfer is highly effective and allows for a broader operating range, including ultra-lean conditions. The Biot number B is crucial here; for counter-flow reactors, a high B (minimized axial conduction) is optimal because it maximizes heat exchange between counter-flowing streams. This design inherently minimizes external surface area for heat loss (small ̃H), as the outer walls are minimized in a spiral geometry. Consequently, counter-flow reactors can achieve superadiabatic temperatures (̃T > 1) more readily because the internal channels are shielded, reducing ̃H. Consequently, counter-flow reactors often demonstrate ̃U values significantly higher than those in unidirectional reactors. For instance, a Swiss roll combustor can operate at φ as low as 0.1 with U_in up to 100 cm/s, whereas unidirectional reactors might be limited to moderate equivalence ratios. The Swiss roll's compactness further enhances performance by reducing overall heat loss pathways, enabling stabilization beyond conventional flammability limits with enhanced burning rates.

## Question 4

### 问题

Using the one-dimensional model for a flame in a tube with high thermal conductivity walls, derive the relationship for the non-dimensional burning velocity ̃U = U / S_L in terms of the flame area A_f and the cross-sectional area A_CS. Explain how the increase in flame surface area and preheating contribute to the overall burning rate enhancement. Include the effects of solid conductivity k_s and emissivity ε on the burning rate, referencing the results from Hackert et al. shown in Fig. 7 of the paper.

### 标准答案

The one-dimensional model for a flame in a tube considers heat transfer through the wall. The burning velocity U is related to the inlet velocity U_in and the flame geometry. The dimensionless burning velocity per unit flame area U_f is defined as U_f = U_b / (A_f / A_CS * S_L), where U_b is the burning velocity. For a tube with diameter d, the flame area A_f can be greater than the cross-sectional area A_CS, especially at higher U_in. For large diameter tubes (d/d_q = 2.46), the flame area A_f / A_CS can reach up to 6 for high U_in, as shown in Gauthier et al. (Fig. 6). Specifically, when U_in is low, A_f / A_CS ≈ 1, but as U_in increases, A_f / A_CS increases significantly. The non-dimensional burning velocity is thus ̃U = U_in / S_L = (A_f / A_CS) * U_f. For small diameter tubes, U_f can be as high as 2, indicating that the burning velocity per unit area is enhanced due to preheating. The overall enhancement is a combination of increased flame area and enhanced reaction rates due to heat recirculation. The effect of solid conductivity k_s is significant: increasing k_s from 5 to 15 W/mK results in a >50% increase in burning rate. Similarly, increasing emissivity ε has a modest effect, particularly for ε > 0.1. Mathematically, the burning rate is a function of k_s and ε. From Hackert et al., the burning rate increases with k_s, but for ε, the effect saturates. The governing equations include the energy equations for gas and solid phases, and the heat recirculation is quantified by the energy recycled. The burning rate enhancement is therefore ̃U ∝ f(k_s, ε, geometry). For a radially insulated tube, the heat recirculation via axial conduction is dominant. The model captures that for smaller diameters, the heat recirculation effect is stronger, leading to higher ̃U values. For example, with k_s = 15 W/mK and ε = 0.9, the burning rate can be several times the laminar flame speed, even if temperatures are subadiabatic. The derivation shows that ̃U = (A_f / A_CS) * U_f, where U_f is the burning velocity per unit flame area. When the flame is not flat, the area ratio increases, contributing to the overall ̃U > 1.

## Question 5

### 问题

Explain the phenomenon of 'flame anchoring' in filtration combustion reactors, particularly in the context of micro-fibrous porous media. Why does this phenomenon occur, and how does it differ from the typical propagation behavior described by Babkin's theory. Discuss the conditions under which a stationary reaction front can be maintained over a range of inlet velocities, contrary to the unique velocity predicted for a zero-propagation front. Provide a detailed physical explanation, including the roles of hydrodynamic instability and flame front distortion. Reference the work of Sirotkin et al. and Fursenko.

### 标准答案

Flame anchoring in filtration combustion refers to the stabilization of the reaction zone at a fixed position relative to the solid over a range of flow conditions, rather than at a single unique velocity. This anchoring regime is observed when the flame front becomes distorted due to hydrodynamic instability, which increases the flame surface area. This allows the burning velocity to match the flow velocity at different locations within the reactor, thus allowing for a range of stable inlet velocities for a given equivalence ratio. In typical filtration combustion, the reaction front propagates at a velocity u_w relative to the solid, and for u_w = 0, the temperature rise equals the adiabatic value, but in anchoring, the flame remains stationary even when the inlet velocity changes, within limits. According to Babkin's theory, for a stationary front (u_w = 0), the condition is unique. However, in micro-fibrous media with very small fibers (e.g., 4 μm diameter), the flame does not propagate upstream or downstream over a certain velocity range. This is attributed to the variation in flame shape and area with axial position. When the flame front is distorted (e.g., inclined or fragmented), the effective burning area A_f changes, so the burning velocity U_b = A_f * S_f, where S_f is the flame speed per unit area. When the flame area increases, U_b increases, compensating for an increase in U_in. Thus, the condition U_in = U_b can be satisfied at multiple flow rates. The physical mechanism involves the interaction between the flow field and the flame. Hydrodynamic instability can cause the flame to adopt a non-planar shape, such as an inclined front, which has a larger surface area than a flat flame. Therefore, the flame can anchor at different positions corresponding to different flame areas. This differs from the standard low-velocity regime where u_w is typically non-zero. In the anchoring regime, the heat recirculation and loss balance are such that the flame position self-regulates to maintain stability. For example, in a two-dimensional model with discrete pores, the flame can stabilize at various points where the local burning velocity balances the local flow velocity. For example, Sirotkin et al. predicted and observed a range of flame-anchored states. This contrasts with the unique solution for u_w = 0. The mathematical model includes the Navier-Stokes equations for the gas and energy equations for both phases. The flame anchoring is thus a result of the flame's ability to adjust its shape and thus its effective area, allowing for stabilization over a range of inlet velocities, which is not predicted by simple one-dimensional models that assume a planar flame. Thus, the phenomenon is linked to the ability of the flame to change its structure in response to flow variations, allowing the reaction zone to remain stationary over a band of operating conditions, enhancing practical operability.
