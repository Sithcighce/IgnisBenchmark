## Question 1

### 问题

In the context of biochar activation for SO2 adsorption, explain how the CO2 activation temperature affects both pore structure development and surface functional groups formation, and discuss why there exists an optimal activation temperature range.

### 标准答案

During CO2 activation, increasing temperature promotes the reaction between CO2 and carbon atoms in biochar (C + CO2 → 2CO), which develops micropores by removing carbon atoms. At lower temperatures (<800°C), this reaction gradually increases micropore volume and surface area. However, excessive temperatures (>800°C) lead to pore widening and collapse as adjacent micropores merge, reducing effective adsorption sites. Simultaneously, high temperatures decompose oxygen-containing functional groups crucial for chemisorption. The balance between these competing effects creates an optimal temperature window (~700-800°C) where micropore development peaks while retaining sufficient functional groups. Mathematically, the reaction rate follows Arrhenius behavior (k = A·e^(-Ea/RT)), explaining the temperature dependence of pore formation.

## Question 2

### 问题

Analyze the Mars-Maessen mechanism for Hg0 removal by MnOx-functionalized biochar, including the redox cycles and oxygen transfer processes, and explain why CeO2 co-doping enhances performance.

### 标准答案

The Mars-Maessen mechanism involves: (1) Hg0 adsorption on Mn4+ sites: Hg0 + 2Mn4+ → Hg2+ + 2Mn3+; (2) Lattice oxygen regeneration: Mn2O3 + 2CeO2 → 2MnO2 + Ce2O3. CeO2 enhances this via oxygen storage capacity - its Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycle (Ce2O3 + ½O2 → 2CeO2) replenishes lattice oxygen consumed in Hg oxidation. The synergistic effect arises because: (i) CeO2 prevents MnOx deactivation by maintaining Mn in higher oxidation states, (ii) Oxygen vacancies at CeO2 interfaces adsorb gaseous O2 forming reactive chemisorbed oxygen (O*), and (iii) Electron transfer between Mn/Ce creates more defects. DFT studies show the Mn-Ce interaction lowers activation energy for Hg oxidation from 173.7 kJ/mol to 31.6 kJ/mol.

## Question 3

### 问题

Calculate the Knudsen diffusion coefficient for CO2 in biochar micropores (0.7 nm) at 120°C, and compare it with ordinary diffusion to determine the dominant transport mechanism.

### 标准答案

Knudsen diffusion dominates when pore diameter (d_p) < mean free path (λ). For CO2 (kinetic diameter 0.33 nm) at 120°C (393K): λ = kT/(√2πd_gas^2P) = (1.38×10^-23×393)/(√2π(0.33×10^-9)^2×101325) ≈ 68 nm. Since d_p (0.7 nm) << λ, Knudsen diffusion applies. The Knudsen coefficient D_K = (d_p/3)√(8RT/πM) = (0.7×10^-9/3)√(8×8.314×393/π×0.044) ≈ 1.2×10^-6 m²/s. Ordinary diffusion D_AB ≈ 0.1 cm²/s (10^-5 m²/s) for CO2-N2. The ratio D_K/D_AB ≈ 0.12 indicates Knudsen diffusion dominates in micropores. This explains why biochars with 0.33-0.63 nm pores show optimal CO2 adsorption at 25°C and 1 bar.

## Question 4

### 问题

Explain how ball-milling modifies biochar's VOC adsorption performance through changes in particle morphology and surface chemistry, with emphasis on polarity effects.

### 标准答案

Ball-milling induces three key modifications: (1) Particle size reduction increases external surface area (BET ↑ 2-5×) and opens interior pores, enhancing accessibility. (2) Mechanical energy breaks C-C bonds, creating radicals that react with atmospheric O2 to form oxygenic groups (-COOH, C=O), increasing polarity (O/C ratio ↑). (3) Delamination exposes aromatic π-electron systems. For polar VOCs (acetone, ethanol), the oxygen groups enable dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding (-OH···O=C<), increasing partition coefficients (K_F ↑). For nonpolar VOCs (benzene), π-π stacking with graphitic domains dominates. The competitive adsorption follows: acetone > chloroform > cyclohexane, correlating with polarity indexes (5.1 > 4.1 > 0.2). Ball-milling time optimization (~30 min) balances these effects versus particle aggregation.
