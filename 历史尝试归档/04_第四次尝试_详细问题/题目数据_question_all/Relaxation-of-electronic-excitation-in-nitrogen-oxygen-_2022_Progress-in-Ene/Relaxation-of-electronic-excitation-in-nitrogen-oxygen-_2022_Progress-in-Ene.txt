Fast gas heating 

Fast gas heating (FGH) is an abrupt increase in gas temperature in non-equilibrium low-temperature plasma due to 
relaxation of electronically excited states of atoms and molecules. In the active flow control, fast gas heating is 
responsible for thermal frequency perturbations in the range of unstable frequencies of flow instabilities. In plasma- 
assisted combustion, abrupt temperature increase due to FGH, together with generation of radicals in plasma, induces 
acceleration of combustion chemistry providing shortening of the induction delay time and intensification of com-
bustion. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made towards the understanding of kinetics of the fast gas 
heating. New observations of fast gas heating in air and nitrogen/oxygen mixtures have been reported. The result of 
experiments, reporting heating to thousands of kelvins during tens of nanoseconds at atmospheric pressure in non- 
combustible  mixtures,  have  provided  new  opportunities  in  the  development  of  kinetic  models.  Electron-impact 
dissociation, quenching of electronically excited states of atoms and molecules, ion-molecular reactions, recombi-
nation of charged particles are reviewed analysing their role in the fast gas heating. The fraction of energy spent on fast 
gas heating ηR has been suggested as a universal parameter to generalize the results of empirical research on energy 
relaxation. This paper considers the dependence of ηR on reduced electric field, specific delivered energy, oxygen 
fraction in the mixture and other parameters. The analysis is grouped over three different ranges of the reduced 
electric field: E/N ≤ 150 Td, E/N = 150–400 Td and E/N > 400 Td. Non-numerous experimental and theoretical 
studies of the fast gas heating in hydrogen- and hydrocarbon-containing mixtures are discussed and compared to the 
results in non-flammable mixtures. This article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress of kinetics of 
fast gas heating and to indicate the lack of experimental data and consequently, the gap in the knowledge of energy 
relaxation in discharges in combustible mixtures.   

1. Introduction 

In  recent  years,  multidisciplinary  research  in  plasma  physics, 
combustion and flow control has resulted in the development of several 
new  fields,  namely  plasma  assisted  ignition  of  combustible  mixtures, 
plasma  assisted  flow  control, and  an  emerging  field  –  stabilization  of 
ultra-lean mixture combustion by combining chemical and gas-dynamic 
impact of low-temperature plasma. 

Combustion  of  hydrocarbon  fuels  is  the  world’s  major  source  of 
energy. At present, about 80% of energy worldwide (transport, electric 
power generation, heating, and so on) is provided by combustion; it is 

very much worth studying and optimizing this process. A decrease in 
ignition  delay  time  in  the  short  residence  time  systems,  such  as 
supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) engines, the development of 
detonation  engines  and  homogeneous  charge  compression  ignition 
(HCCI) engines, efficient ignition of biofuels, new lean burn engines to 
meet modern emission standards and other challenges require new non- 
standard solutions. Recently, a concept of plasma-assisted combustion 
has  been  suggested  and  developed  [1–6].  The  term  “plasma-assisted 
ignition/combustion”  (PAI/PAC)  is  used  for  combustion,  initiated  or 
sustained by low-temperature non-equilibrium plasma of gas discharges. 
Another example of the potential use of low-temperature plasma for 
airspace applications is plasma flow control [7–11]. Plasma flow control

includes  drag  reduction,  lift  enhancement,  shock  wave  control,  aero-
dynamic  noise  reduction,  boundary  layer  re-attachment.  Various  dis-
charges are used for plasma flow control, but the most efficient action is 
typically related to fast thermal energy release at specific points of flow 
in the discharge area [8–10,12]. 

Benefits of plasma-assisted combustion and plasma flow control are 
merged together [13] in the field of plasma ignition of lean combustible 
mixtures and plasma stabilization of lean flames. Specific attention to 
lean combustion is related to strict limitations for thermal NOx emission: 
as far as lean mixtures burn at lower temperature than stoichiometric 
mixtures, NOx emissions are lower [14]. 

At high pressures, ignition of combustible mixtures starts in separated 
discharge channels localized in space. Ignition in the whole volume of 
combustion chamber is driven by propagation of combustion waves. In 
lean mixtures, combustion waves are so slow (for example, in mixtures of 
methane, propane, butane with air at ER < 0.7, and T0 = 300 K, flame 
propagation velocity does not exceed 30 cm/s [15]) that even in milli-
seconds combustion can be localized near the ignition point only. One of 
the concepts discussed in [16–19] is that the speed of combustion wave 
can be increased when a system of transitory weak shock waves interacts 
with the main combustion wave front. So, ignition of lean mixtures can be 
efficient if gas heating in ignition zones occurs at characteristic times 
shorter than a typical gas-dynamic time. 

One of the solutions for efficient combustion of lean mixtures is using 
a lean premixed swirl burner. Although rotating gas flow stabilizes the 
flame  by  induced  recirculation  of  hot  combustion  products  near  the 
nozzle  [20],  the  flame  instabilities  still  can  be  high  in  these  burners. 
Recently, high efficiency of plasma control in increasing flame stability 
and  lowering  the  blow-off  limit  were  demonstrated  [21–25].  The  au-
thors used repetitively-pulsed nanosecond discharges which effectively 
generate  active  species  and  gas-dynamic  perturbations  due  to  heat 
release in the discharge. According to [23–24], pulsed nanosecond dis-
charges  allow  stabilization  of  lean  premixed  flames  in  laboratory 
burners with plasma power typically less than 1% of the power released 
by the flame. 

A few plasma “sub-classes” are distinguished in plasma physics. The 
terms  "high-temperature  plasma"  and  "low-temperature  plasma", 
"equilibrium plasma" and "non-equilibrium plasma" are widely used. The 
term  "high-temperature  plasma"  applies  to  the  cases  when  the 
temperature exceeds 106–108 K and the ionization degree is close to the 
unity  or  higher.  Classical  examples  are  plasma  of  stellar  interior  or 
fusion plasma. In this sense, any plasma used for combustion or other 
"common"  industrial  applications,  is  low-temperature  plasma.  Low- 
temperature  plasma  is  divided  into  equilibrium  and  non-equilibrium 
plasma.  Low-temperature  non-equilibrium  plasma  (typically  corre-
sponding  to  the  electron  temperature  about  thousands  of  K  and  the 
(cid:0) 3)  was  introduced  into 
ionization  degree  on  the  level  of  Ne/N  < 10
technological  processes  in  the  70th  of  the  20th  century  [26–28]. 
"Non-equilibrium"  means  that  there  is  no  (contrary  to  the  case  of 
equilibrium plasma) common temperature for all the sub-systems; due 
to the effect of the electric field and to the hindered energy exchange 
between  different  sub-systems,  such  as  translational,  vibrational,  and 
electronic  degrees  of freedom,  the  relation Tg  << Te, where  Tg  is  gas 
temperature, and Te is electron temperature, is true for non-equilibrium 
plasma. Mean electron energy for low-temperaure plasma, a few eV (1 
eV equals 11610 K), is comparable to the energy of chemical bonds in 
the  molecules,  while  gas  temperature  can  vary  between  ambient  and 
electron  temperature,  depending  upon  the  conditions.  More  details 
about physics of low-temperature gas discharge plasma can be found in 
[26–28]. 

Different  types  of  discharges  were  tested  for  PAI/PAC  including 
pulsed  nanosecond  discharges,  gliding  arcs,  microwave  discharge, 
corona  discharges,  dielectric  barrier  discharges  (DBDs)  and  plasma 
torches; the review can be found in [1,5,6]. Discharges used for active 
flow control are reviewed in [9,10]. 

A  possibility  to  control  plasma  parameters,  in  particular  mean 
electron  energy,  provides  the  opportunity  to  change  the  energy 
branching  in  plasma  mainly  from  the  excitation  of  low-energy 
vibrational  levels  to  the  excitation  of  high-  energy  electronic  states 
and ionization. At high electric fields, the main dissociation pathway is 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience91(2022)1009282N.A. Popov and S.M. Starikovskaia                                                                                                                                                                                                         

via the excitation of the electronic states of molecules by electron impact 
[26]. 

In fuel-air mixtures, the combination of the efficient excitation with 
fast quenching of electronically excited molecules and atoms provides: 
(i)  dissociation  of  oxygen  and  fuel  molecules,  partial  gas  mixture 
reforming; (ii) an increase of gas temperature (so-called “fast gas heat-
ing” [29]) triggering of a chain reaction of combustion or localized heat 
release in air initiating formation of vortices in the boundary layer for 
plasma flow control.

Reviews [2,30] describe the peculiarities of the energy branching in 
non-equilibrium  plasma  and  kinetics  of  plasma-assisted  ignition;  the 
current review focuses on the details of the fast gas heating mechanism 
in nitrogen-oxygen and fuel-air plasma. In this paper, the term "fast gas 
heating" (FGH) is used for heating occurring in the time much shorter 
than  the  time  of  VT-relaxation,  VV-  and  VV
-exchange.  At  high  pres-
sures, the discharge usually develops as a system of thin plasma chan-
nels; in this case, FGH can be faster than a typical gas-dynamic heating. 
Review [5] notices that, in spite of several significant advances in 
understanding of non-thermal and thermal effects, kinetic pathways of 
atomic  oxygen  production, experimental  proof  of  lower  lean blowout 
and flammability limits, flame regime transition of the classical ignition 
S-curve,  there  are  still  many  missing  reaction  pathways  in  plasma 
assisted  combustion.  We  believe  that  FGH  reactions  are  among  these 
missing pathways. They are uncommon either to discharge physics or to 
combustion  but  they  are  very  important  for  PAI/PAC,  providing, 
together with extra-density of radicals, an increase in gas temperature, 
and  thus  intensification  of  combustion  reactions  at  sub-microsecond 
time scale. 

Discharge/combustion  chemistry  and  hydrodynamics  are  closely 
linked  in  the  problem  of  plasma  assisted  combustion.  Papers  [31,32] 
study  so-called  thermal-chemical  instability  in  combustible  mixtures. 
Heat release due to combustion chemistry leads, at times longer than 
gas-dynamic  times,  to  expansion  of  a  plasma  channel.  Mean  electron 
energy  in  the  discharge  is  determined  by  reduced  electric  field  E/N; 
where E is the electric field and N is the number density of gas [27]. 
Decrease of a gas density results in increase of E/N, efficiency of ioni-
zation and development of ionization-heating instability accompanying 
by contraction of plasma channel [31,32]. 

We  review  the  early  papers  on  fast  gas  heating  and  discuss  the 
renewal  of  interest  in  fast  gas  heating  during  the  last  20  years.  We 
provide modern ideas on the efficiency of fast gas heating as a function 
of reduced electric field in the discharge. An analysis of experimental 
approaches and measurement techniques allows estimating the accuracy 
of the available measurements. Since most of the data is available for 
non-combustible mixtures and since most practical combustion mixtures 
contain air, we provide a detailed review of measurements/calculations 
in air and a comparative analysis of hydrogen-air and hydrocarbon-air 
mixtures. Data on FGH in pure nitrogen and nitrogen with small addi-
tions of oxygen provide supplementary ideas on the kinetics of fast gas 
heating due to quenching of electronically excited nitrogen molecules, 
and  potentially  important  for  the  development  of  FGH  models  for 
combustible mixtures. These data are given in Appendix. 

2. Early papers on fast gas heating 

Rates  of  generating  the  species  by  electron  impact  is  a  strong 
(typically  multi-exponential)  function  of  E/N.  If  the  duration  of  the 
discharge pulse exceeds a typical gas-dynamic time, gas heating results 
in a decrease in the gas number density and so, in an increase in the 
reduced electric field E/N. As a result, the ionization rate increases, the 
specific power increases and gas heating increases again leading finally 
to  discharge  constriction.  This  scenario  is  called  ionization-heating 
instability  [27];  in  this  case,  the  discharge  contraction  can  signifi-
cantly  affect  the  ignition  of  combustible  mixtures.  This  instability  is 
observed  in  direct  current  (DC)  discharges  [27,29],  microwave  dis-
charges  [33–35]  and  some  other  plasma  types.  Gas  heating  can  also 

cause different discharge modes: it was shown in [36] that transition 
from  Trichel  pulses  to  pulseless  glow  mode  of  negative  DC  corona 
discharge in atmospheric pressure air is controlled by fast gas heating. 
Early  experimental  papers  [33,37]  reviewed  in  details  in  [29] 
reported heat release at times shorter than VT-relaxation time in MW 
discharge  in  nitrogen  at  reduced  electric  fields  Е/N = 80-200  Td  (1 
Td = 0.33 V cm
C). About 10–15% of the 
total  discharge  energy  released  this  fast  way.  Early  papers  [29,33, 
37–40] concluded that fast gas heating can be explained by fast ther-
malization of a part of energy stored in electronically excited states of 
molecular nitrogen.

In [38], on the basis of observations of gas expansion, the dynamics 
of gas temperature in a pulsed, τimp = 1 μs, DC discharge in molecular 
nitrogen  was  measured  (P = 100  Torr,  delivered  energy  ≈ 0.5  J/cm3 
atm). The authors distinguish two stages of gas heating: fast, with the 
energy release about 10% of the energy stored in the discharge - within 
30  μs,  and  slow,  corresponding  to  the  energy  release  of  40%  within 
0.5 ms. Theoretical study [41] explained the slow stage using a model of 
VV-exchange  in  the  system  of  anharmonic  oscillators.  However,  any 
attempts to explain the fast stage have failed. It was underlined [41] that 
the  observed  effect  can  be  a  consequence  of  heat  release  due  to  the 
quenching of electronically excited nitrogen molecules. Similar results 
were obtained in a wide range of delivered energies in [39,40] etc. 

Later  studies  [33,37,42]  reported  time-resolved  temperature  mea-
surements in a pulsed microwave discharge. The majority of measure-
ments was  made  in  nitrogen and  air at  pressures P = 10–40 Torr  and 
reduced  electric  fields  E/N = 80–250  Td.  Details  of  the  experimental 
techniques are given in the section 4. The results confirmed an increase 
in gas temperature (as observed earlier) faster than VT-relaxation. It was 
also  shown  [33]  that  the  rate  of  fast  gas  heating  increases  with  gas 
pressure and significantly increases with reduced electric field.

A suggested theoretical explanation of fast gas heating involved the 
fact that a substantial amount of energy, up to electron volts, is released 
in collisional deactivation of electronically excited nitrogen molecules – 
and so the greater is reduced electric field, the higher is fast gas heating. 
The first proposed kinetic mechanism was based on pooling reaction of

However, the model based on pooling reaction did not explain the 
experimental  data  on  the  heating  rate  in  the  mixtures  with  different 
percentage of molecular oxygen [33,42]. According to the model, fast 
gas  heating  should  decrease  in  N2/O2  mixtures  as  a  consequence  of 
N2(A3Σ+
u )  depletion  through  quenching  by  O2  molecules,  while  the 
experimentally  measured  heating  rate  increased  with  oxygen  fraction 
[42].  In  [43],  it  was  suggested  that  quenching  of  electronically  and 
vibrationally  excited  molecular  nitrogen  at  the  levels  higher  than 
N2(A3Σ+
u , v = 3,4) (the excitation energy is 6.6 eV) in collisions with 
ground state N2 molecules results in energy release for gas heating. For 
example,  quenching  of  N2(a1Пg)-state  with  the  excitation  energy  of 
8.6 eV provides about 2 eV for FGH. This suggestion was in contradiction 
with the available experimental data [44,45] showing that quenching of 
electronically excited nitrogen by ground state N2(Х1Σ+
g ) molecules re-
sults in minimum possible energy release for gas heating. 

Thus, several models of fast gas heating [33,37,43] were suggested 
before 2000. They allowed describing a part of the experimental data in 
the narrow range of electric fields. Over the past 20 years, the devel-
opment of a comprehensive model of fast gas heating in a wide range of 
the electric fields, E/N = 50–1000 Td, has become an important task. 

3. Renewal of interest in fast gas heating during the last 20 
years. Fast gas heating in air as a function of reduced electric 
field 

The renewal of interest to fast gas heating was provoked by the study 
of  plasma  flow  control  [7–9,46–48]  and  plasma  assisted  ignition  and 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience91(2022)1009283N.A. Popov and S.M. Starikovskaia                                                                                                                                                                                                         

combustion [1,2,4,5,30,49,50,51,52] by pulsed nanosecond discharges. 
A  peculiarity  of  nanosecond  plasma  is  that  the  electric  fields  in  the 
discharge are high, on the order of 100 Td and higher [53–57]. 

Surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) plasma actuators pow-
ered by nanosecond duration pulses demonstrate flow reattachment at 
high  flow  velocities  up  to  M = 0.85  [58].  The  main  difference  of  the 
actuators powered by nanosecond pulses, comparing to the alternative 
current (AC) DBD actuators, is synchronized, on a sub-nanosecond time 
scale, start of parallel plasma channels (streamers) from the edge of the 
high-voltage  electrode.  Each  streamer  generates  weak  compression 
waves  caused  by  fast  heat  release  in  the  discharge  on  the  time  scale 
shorter  than  the  acoustic  time  scale.  In  airflow  configuration  of  the 
electrodes,  two  waves  are  observed  –  a  spherical  wave  near  the 
high-voltage electrode and a cylindrical wave along the plasma channel. 
The  resultant  of  individual  waves  from  each  streamer  generates  two 
compression waves: a cylindrical wave along the high-voltage electrode 
and a plane wave from the dielectric surface [8,59–61]. As a result, the 
nanosecond SDBD discharge, repeating with a certain frequency in the 
flow  around the airfoil, excites  shear layer  instabilities and generates 
coherent  flow  structures  (spanwise  vortices)  providing  flow  reattach-
ment [47,58,62]. 

Two important effects related to fast heat release should be noted in 
applications  of  nanosecond  plasma  for  combustion:  first,  temperature 
increase  induces  acceleration  of  chemical  reactions  providing  short-
ening  of  the  induction  delay  time  and  intensification  of  combustion 
process [2,4,5]; second, in particular case of pulse-periodic nanosecond 
discharges, fast heat release in each pulse causes gas-dynamic pertur-
bations.  Interaction  of  these  perturbations  with  already  existing  heat 
region  causes  expansion  of  the  region  over  a  large  volume  (a  cubic 
centimeter  at  atmospheric  pressure)  within  a  time  shorter  than  the 
typical ignition delay time [63]. These effects, together with fast and 
efficient production of radicals, provide significant, of a few orders of 
magnitude, reduction in the ignition delay time or sustain combustion of 
lean mixtures. 

With  the  exception  of  hydrogen  and  simplest  hydrocarbons,  the 
fraction of fuel molecules in stoichiometric and lean fuel-air mixtures is 
relatively small. Fast gas heating in these mixtures is based mainly on 
the kinetics of fast gas heating in nitrogen-oxygen mixtures. This is a 
reason why we will first analyze the mechanism of gas heating in air and 
in nitrogen with O2 admixtures, and then will review the FGH features in 
stoichiometric hydrogen-air and methane-air mixtures. 

To systematize knowledge gained from study of different plasmas, it 
was vitally important to select some universal parameters to describe

fast gas heating. The experiments were made in different discharges at 
different reduced electric fields, at different initial pressures and specific 
delivered energy. The parameter suggested in [29,64] is the fraction of a 
total energy delivered to plasma spent on fast gas heating ηR. We will call 
this parameter the energy efficiency of fast gas heating. The value of ηR is 
a function of reduced electric field in the discharge and practically does 
not depend upon the electron density and gas pressure. The available 
experimental  data  and  theoretical  curves  are  given  in  Figure  1  as  a 
function of the FGH efficiency ηR upon reduced electric field E/N.

4. Experimental approaches: measurements related to fast gas 
heating 

Only  a  few tens  of  papers  on experimental  studies  simultaneously 
quantify the rate of energy thermalization in the known electric field 
and the magnitude of temperature rise with nanosecond resolution; our 
review  of  the  experimental  technique  and  accuracy  of  measurements 
will be based mainly on these publications. Early experimental studies of 
fast  has  heating  at  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century  [37,39,40,67] 
were motivated by the use of gas discharges as active media for lasers; 
stability of volumetric discharges was influenced by the change in gas 
temperature. The results of fast energy release are available mainly for 
two gas discharges at moderate pressure: stationary DC self-sustained 
discharge powered by a voltage pulse with a 100-ns high voltage peak 
and  sub-microsecond  plateau  after  the  peak,  the  discharge  ignited  in 
molecular nitrogen at P = 76 Torr [39,40]; and pulsed microwave (MW) 
discharge in nitrogen and air with 10% of NH3 at total pressure of 8–30 
Torr [37]. 

Volumetric DC discharge in nitrogen, 2.5 × 4 × 40 cm3, was initiated 
with the help of UV pre-ionization from multiple spark discharges sit-
uated 2.4 cm apart from the grid cathode. The authors report, without 
detailed explanations, a stationary value of reduced electric field to be 
–16  V cm2. Laser interferometry (using He-Ne laser in 
around (7-8) ⋅ 10
[39] and ruby laser in [40]) provided, with a resolution of one micro-
second, the map of gas density changes. The authors observed a region of 
enhanced heat release in the discharge at the time scale shorter than 
typical acoustic time [39,40] and supposed, on the basis of theoretical 
consideration, that (i) rapid energy release is explained by relaxation of 
energy from electronic levels directly to heat; (ii) the fraction of energy 
spent to fast gas heating is a function of reduced electric field, E/N. 

The advantage of a self-sustained microwave discharge localized in 
space is that the value of electric field E can be obtained with known 
amplitude of the electric field, discharge frequency and gas density: E =
√
, where νe is the electron-neutral collision frequency, Emw and

Intracavity laser absorption was used to measure the distribution of 
population of the NH2 molecule rotational levels in pulsed (60 μs) self- 
sustained microwave discharge, freely localized in space [37]; the ac-
curacy of rotational temperature measurements was reported to be 10%. 
Spatial  resolution  of  measurements  was  limited  by  the  laser  beam 
diameter, 3 mm, and temporal resolution was determined by the laser 
generation  duration,  1.5  μs.  Rotational  temperature  was  additionally 
measured by optical emission spectroscopy of the second positive system 
(SPS) of molecular nitrogen; two techniques have shown good consis-
tency. The authors reported that during the pulsed MW discharge, the

rate of gas heating is up to 10–15 K/μs. The final rotation temperature 
was about 500 K. 

Early  experiments  on  fast  gas  heating  do  not  provide  experimental 
information about specific delivered energy, furthermore, no data on FGH 
are available for the reduced electric field exceeding 100 Td. These data 
have been obtained recently for pulsed nanosecond discharges [65,66,69, 
71,73–78]. It should be noted that measurements using laser interferom-
etry, available only in the earliest papers [39,40], appear again in the latest 
publications [79,80] combining schlieren and interferometry techniques 
with time resolution of 70 ps and spatial resolution of 3–4 μm. 

The experimental techniques to study fast energy release in nano-
second discharges include time-resolved voltage and current measure-
ments  for  all  papers  analyzed  below  and  different  supplementary 
measurements, namely capacitive probes to measure electric field [65, 
76,78]; optical emission spectroscopy to measure rotational distribution 
related to gas temperature [65,66,69,70,73,76–78], schlieren or shadow 
imaging  [66,71,74]  related  to  energy  release  and  allowing,  in  some 
cases, judgment about delivered energy or energy density; spontaneous 
Raman  scattering  (SRS)  to  measure  gas  temperature  and  vibrational 
distribution of N2  and O2  molecules in early afterglow at atmospheric

pressure  [69,75];  picosecond  CARS  spectroscopy  [74]  at  moderate 
pressure to measure time- and space-resolved gas temperature. 

A few geometries of nanosecond discharges were used to quantify 
FGH  experimentally:  surface  dielectric  barrier  discharges  similar  to 
airflow configuration at pressure between 300 Torr and 1 atm [66,77], 
pin-to-pin atmospheric pressure discharges at room or elevated (up to 
1000 K) initial temperature [69,70,71,73,75], and uniform volumetric 
discharges at moderate pressure and initial temperature T = 300 K [65, 
66,76,78]  including  the  volumetric  nanosecond  glow  discharge  not 
confined  in  the  discharge  tube  [74].  The  examples  of  experimental 
setups are shown in Figure 2. 

Obtaining experimental waveforms of voltage on the electrodes and 
electrical current is similar for all the considered nanosecond discharges. 
Commercially available or custom-made broadband voltage and current 
probes  based  on  the  principle  of  capacitive/resistive  voltage/current 
division or on the measurement of magnetic flux through the coil are 
typically  used.  It  is  important  to  take  into  account  the  time  of  the 
electromagnetic  signal  propagation  through  the  cables  (the  speed  of 
electromagnetic  wave  for  coaxial  cables  with  polyethylene  filling  is 
about  20  cm/ns)  and  to  provide  synchronization  within  a  part  of 
nanosecond between the waveforms. 

Energy deposited in the discharge is obtained by multiplying voltage 

and current waveforms, and integrating the result over time: 

∫τ

W =

U(t)Icond(t)dt,

0

U(t) is a voltage over the discharge gap and Icond  (t) is a conductivity 
current.  Special  precautions  are  usually  taken  to  extract,  before  the 
integration, the current of charging the discharge cell capacitance before 
the  development  of  conductivity  and  the  displacement  current  Idisp. 
Displacement current can be found knowing reactor capacitance C and 
time derivative of voltage dU/dt [69–71,73,75]:  

Idisp = C

Another approach to find the energy deposited in plasma was used in 
[65,66,76,77,78] where the discharge cell was inserted into a break of a 
long  coaxial  cable.  The  length  of  the  cable  between  the  high  voltage 
pulse  and the  discharge cell, several  tens of meters,  allowed separate 
measurements  of  the  incident  pulse  and  the  pulse  reflected  from  the 
discharge  cell  because  of  electrical  mismatching.  The  cable  after  the 
discharge  cell, up  to 200  m  in length  [65,76] provided  an adjustable 
delay between the discharge and the probe pulse due to the mismatching 
and  different  values  of  the  terminal  load,  for  the  measurements  of 
plasma  parameters  in  early  afterglow.  Calibrated  custom-made  back 
current shunts were installed in the cable before and after the discharge 
cell, at a distance about 15 m from the cell. The following electric cur-
rent pulses were measured: incident Iinc, reflected from the discharge cell 
Iref  and  transmitted  through  the  discharge  cell  Itr.  Attenuation  in  the 
cable  and  charging  of  the  electrode  were  taken  into  account  by  cali-
bration at well-defined conditions, at too low or too high pressure for the 
discharge development. The absence of the discharge was checked by 
the absence of the emission and the absence of ionization wave. Finally, 
the energy deposited in the discharge was found as the difference be-
tween the energy stored in incident pulse, and the sum of energies in 
reflected and transmitted pulses:

Here Z is a characteristic impedance of the cable. In case of discharge 
with  open  electrodes,  the  accuracy  of  measurements  of  total  energy 
delivered to the discharge can be as low as a few percent (3–5%). In case

positive system of molecular nitrogen in air built based on the calculations [83];

of capacitive load, such as the discharge in surface DBD configuration, 
the current for charging the electrode can be comparable to or higher 
than  the  current  flowing  when  generating  plasma,  causing  possible 
systematical  errors.  We  estimate  maximum  possible  error  of  energy 
measurements for the capacitive load as 15–20%. 

Time-resolved  emission  from  the  discharge  is  used  to  analyze  the 
discharge uniformity and to estimate the plasma volume in case of non- 
confined discharge. In case of nanosecond discharges, the main input to 
the emission in the near UV and visible range is due to transitions of the 
second  positive  system  (SPS)  of  molecular  nitrogen.  For  air,  the 
quenching time of SPS radiation is determined by collisions of N2(C3Пu) 
state  with  molecular  oxygen,  the  rate  constant  being  equal  [82]  to 
(cid:0) 1. The efficient lifetime of N2(C3Пu) is 0.7 ns at 
kq = 2.7 × 10
atmospheric  pressure,  thus  ICCD  imaging  adequately  reflects  the 
discharge spatial structure, and time resolution is limited by the camera 
gate.

Typically, to experimentally obtain specific delivered energy, total 
delivered  energy  is  divided  by  the  discharge  volume  assuming  that 
spatial  energy  distribution  is  uniform  in  plasma.  More  sophisticated 
approach  can  be  used  when  analyzing  experimental  results  with  nu-
merical  modeling:  electric  field  in  the  discharge  is  calculated  in  1D 
radial  approximation  at  a  given  initial  distribution  of  electrons  and 
waveform of the conductivity current derived from the experiments. The 
resulting E-field is used to calculate total energy delivered to plasma, 
and experimentally measured deposited energy is used to validate the 
data. Finally, we can derive specific delivered energy from the calcula-
tions for any distance from the discharge axis. 

Time- and space-resolved emission of the second positive system of 
molecular nitrogen was used in [66,77] to estimate the specific depos-
ited energy in a spatially non-uniform case of a surface DBD discharge. 
Although the idea on the proportionality between energy input and the 
intensity  of N2(C3Пu) emission  is  controversial, this was  a  reasonable 
approximation in case of a complex 3D structure of the SDBD discharge. 
Measurement  accuracy  of  plasma  volume  and  the  discharge  spatial 
uniformity influence calculation accuracy of specific delivered energy, 
and  each  case  should  be  analyzed  separately.  As  confirmation  of  the 
controversy  situation,  we  provide  (see  Figure  3)  the  results  of  calcu-
lating radial distributions of electron density and emission of the second 
positive  system  for  plasma  channel  in  atmospheric  pressure  air. 
Different FWHM values, 0.16 mm for the electron density and 0.25 mm 
for emission, are clearly seen. 

Direct  electric  field  measurement  is  a  complicated  issue.  In  non- 
confined  open  electrode  discharges  [70,74],  the  electric field  is  often 
estimated as the ratio of the applied voltage and the gap distance. The 
electric field in pin-to-pin atmospheric pressure discharge was estimated 
to be 250 Td or less [70]; the electric field in nanosecond glow discharge 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience91(2022)1009286N.A. Popov and S.M. Starikovskaia                                                                                                                                                                                                         

[74] was estimated to be equal to 120 Td, and 90 Td upon the correction 
to the voltage drop on the cathode layer. Taking into account that a few 
data are available about the cathode voltage drop in nanosecond dis-
charges, we estimate the accuracy of electric field provided this way as 
15–30%. The reduced electric field in the surface DBD discharge [66,77] 
was estimated from the ratio of the emission profiles of the first negative 
system  (391.4  nm)  of  nitrogen  ions  and  the  second  positive  system 
(337.1 nm) of nitrogen molecules. The key idea of the technique is that if 
excitation occurs by direct electron impact and the radiation comes from 
the same spatial region for both molecular bands, then the ratio of the 
emission  intensity  for  the  bands,  corrected  for  the  quenching,  is 
uniquely related to the absolute electric field value at a given point. The 
details  are  given  in  [84,85,86].  A  few  recent  papers  [87–89]  discuss 
restrictions and the accuracy of E-field measurements by optical emis-
sion spectroscopy. 

The restrictions can be significant for surface discharges: at least part 
of emission of electronically excited ions comes from a spatial region 
near a dielectric layer, while emission of excited molecules is integrated 
over all the streamer thickness [54,90]. Spatial distribution of emission 
of the two considered transitions was analyzed in [54] experimentally 
and  numerically.  The  main  conclusion  is  that  the  results  of  measure-
ments and calculations are in reasonable agreement for negative polarity 
discharges;  for  positive  polarity  discharges,  the  measured  ratio  of 
emission of two transitions corresponds to higher values of emission of 
the  nitrogen  ion  than  that  resulting  from  the  modeling,  indicating 
possible  high  electric  fields.  The  values  given  in  the  [66,77]  for  the 
reduced electric fields (1000–1200 Td) are the highest provided in the 
review;  we  estimate  their  accuracy  as  at  least  30–50%  based  on  the 
analysis in [54] for a similar discharge. 

The  difficulties  with  the  electric  field  measurement  can  be  mini-
mized  if  the  discharge  is  confined  in  the  long  tube.  In  this  case,  the 
discharge develops as a fast ionization wave (FIW), where the ionization 
front propagates with high velocities, up to a few cm per nanosecond. 
After passing the discharge front, the field is mainly longitudinal and can 
be  measured  by  calibrated  capacitive  detector  moving  along  the 
discharge  gap  in  the  slit  of  the  metallic  screen.  In  [65,76,78]  the 
capacitive divider made measurements each 1 mm along the discharge 
gap; the accuracy limit of measuring the electric field behind the FIW 
front, in the region of the main energy input, can be estimated as 5–10%. 
Over the last decade, considerable progress has been made in electric 
field measurements by picosecond laser techniques of E-field measure-
ments. We can mention four-wave mixing [55] and  the Electric Field 
Induced Second Harmonic (E-FISH) generation technique [56,57]. Time 
resolution  is  limited  by  the  laser  pulse  duration  and  the  registration 
technique  (e.g.  oscilloscope  bandwidth)  and  is  typically  sub-nano-
second. These  techniques are new, and although they are very prom-
ising, at the moment, (i) there is still questions about validation of the 
experimental approaches used [91]; (ii) no study combining the E-field 
measurement  by  laser  techniques,  specific  delivered  energy  and  gas 
temperature is known. 

Measurements of gas temperature in nanosecond discharge are often 
based on analyzing the emission of rotational lines of the second positive 
system of molecular nitrogen [65,66,69,70,73,75–78]; the details of the 
technique for measuring rotational distribution in plasma are discussed 
in [92]. Typically, rotational distribution is a Boltzmann distribution, 
exp((cid:0) Erot/(kTrot)),  with  rotational  energy  Erot,  Boltzmann  constant  k 
and  rotational temperature Trot. The relation between rotational  tem-
perature of the excited specimen and the gas temperature value depends 
upon the rate of relaxation. There are two limiting cases depending upon 
the ratio of the experimentally observed lifetime of the emitting state tcol 
in  collisions)  and  characteristic  time  of 
(including  quenching 
rotational-translational  relaxation  tRT.  If  tcol  >> tRT,  the  emitting 
atom/molecule is in the thermodynamic equilibrium with surrounding 
exp  is equal to gas tempera-
gas and measured rotational temperature Trot
ture. In another limiting case where tcol << tRT, the molecule emits light 
without any perturbation of rotational distribution initially formed in 

the discharge. 

In the last case, we should consider the history of excitation of the 
upper  N2(C3Пu)  level.  At  high  E/N  values  typical  for  the  nanosecond 
discharges, the main population of N2(C3Пu) is due to direct electron 
impact,  and  rotational  distribution  of  the  excited  state  is  similar  to 
rotational  distribution  of  the  ground  state  according  to  the  Franck- 
Condon principle. The ground state rotational temperature is equal to 
the translational one, and gas temperature can be calculated as

The disadvantage of emission optical spectroscopy technique is that 
spatial distribution of emission intensity should be taken into account. If 
plasma is axisymmetric, an Abel inversion is applied to get the optical 
emission  intensity  distribution  over  the  radius  [69,70,73,75].  If  rota-
tional temperature is different in different regions, the resulting emis-
sion contains the information about some averaged efficient rotational 
temperature  and  this  should  also  be  analyzed  [66,77,78].  Optical 
emission spectroscopy provides quite high accuracy of measurements of 
a  few  K  in  ideal  uniform  case  with  a  single-temperature  Boltzmann 
distribution  over  rotational  lines.  In  conditions  of  non-uniform  gas 
discharge plasma, the accuracy can vary from tens of K to a few hun-
dreds of K, depending upon the experimental situation and the approach 
to the treatment. 

Only a few papers studying the fast gas heating report alternative 
techniques of temperature measurements [66,69,71,74,75]. Shock wave 
propagation through the afterglow of a nanosecond pulsed gas discharge 
with  different  delays  relative  to  the  beginning  of  the  discharge  was 
studied in [66]. Heat release in the afterglow was calculated from the 
acceleration of the shock wave. The maximum observed increase in the 
shock wave velocity of 10–14% was obtained at delays of 100–200 μs 
after the discharge.  Reduced electric field and deposited energy were 
measured  in  [66]  as  in  fast  ionization  wave  using  custom-made  cali-
brated current and voltage probes. 

To determine the initial gas temperature and the fraction of energy 
transferred for ultrafast gas heating in the spatially non-uniform pin-to- 
pin  open  electrodes  nanosecond  discharge  [71],  contrast  profiles 
resulting  from  experimental  and  numerical  Schlieren  images  were 
compared. The suggested method is called “numerical Schlieren”  and, 
according  to  [71],  it  is  much  more  sensitive  to  gas  temperature  and 
fraction  of  energy  transferred  for  heating  than  direct  comparison  of 
measured and predicted shock-wave and heated channel radii. The au-
thors calculate the fraction of heating energy ηR and initial temperature 
T0 through the following procedure: (1) fit the heated channel radius to 
get ηR, (2) fit the shock-wave radius to get initial temperature T0 using ηR 
obtained in step (1), (3) check the contrast profiles to verify ηR  and T0 
calculated  in  steps  (1)  and  (2).  They  report  the  accuracy  of  gas  tem-
perature measurements by using the suggested technique to be equal to 
6–25%,  and  the  accuracy  of  ηR  value  determined  simultaneously,  to 
4–33%. 

Laser  methods  provide  the  highest  possible  spatial  resolution.  For 
example,  laser technique  was  used  for  time- and  space-resolved  mea-
surements  of  gas  temperature  in  [74],  where  picosecond  CARS  spec-
troscopy  and  phased-locked  Schlieren  imaging  were  used  to  measure 
time-resolved temperature and visualize compression waves in a nano-
second  pulsed  discharge  between  a  pair  of  spherical  electrodes  in  ni-
trogen and air at P = 100 Torr. A histogram of 80 spectra obtained under 
identical conditions yielded mean value of T = 302 K with a standard 
deviation of 1.5%. The authors reported a significant temperature rise 
up to ΔT = 200 K at 100 ns in air and at 1 μs in nitrogen, as well as the 
second temperature peak ΔT = 350 K at 100–500 μs in air.

g ) and O2(Х3Σ(cid:0)

In  pin-to-plane  atmospheric  pressure  nanosecond  discharge  in  air 
initiated by high voltage pulses of 25 kV and 25 ns [69,75], gas tem-
perature  during  pulsed  discharge  was  measured  by  OES  of  rotational 
bands in the 0-0 vibrational transition of the molecular nitrogen second 
positive system, while gas temperature in the afterglow and vibrational 
distribution function (VDF) of N2(Х1Σ+
g ) molecules were 
obtained by spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS). The SRS measurement 
resolution was equal to 180 μm. SRS was induced by the second har-
monic (532 nm) of a Nd:YAG laser; pulse duration was about 100 ns. 
Two thousand shot-averaged N2 or O2 experimental Raman spectra were 
acquired  to  get  the  desirable  signal-to-noise  ratio.  The  measurements 
were  made  at  1.5,  3.25  and  5  mm  from  the  pin  electrode,  the  inter-
electrode space being equal to 6.5 mm. The authors reported the accu-
racy  of  OES  measurements  as  ± 50  K  [69];  the  accuracy  of  gas 
temperature SRS measurements are reported to be less than 5% [75]. 
The  temperature  rose  up  to  1400  K  during  first  300  ns  of  the 
post-discharge; strong vibrational excitation of N2 and weak excitation 
of O2 vibrational levels were detected; the second peak of translational 
temperature caused by V-T relaxation was observed between 50 and 100 
microseconds. To measure densities of N2 and O2 in the ground state in 
time and space, the authors integrated the experimental SRS spectrum of 
each  species  knowing  the  Raman  differential  cross  sections,  the  tem-
perature,  collection  efficiency,  laser  power  deposited  and  the  probe 
volume length. The main error sources in these measurements were (i) 
the accuracy of temperature measurements of 5%; (ii) uncertainties in 
spectroscopic  constants  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  differential 
Raman  cross  section  which  are,  according  to  [75],  “more  difficult  to 
estimate”.  Finally,  from  the  measurements  of  N2  and  O2  vibrational 
distributions and gas temperature, the authors calculated relative dis-
tribution  (in  time  and  space)  of  the  energy  deposited  in  the  specific 
molecular modes. The energy deposited in fast gas heating calculated 
150 ns after the increasing front of the electrical current, was reported to 
be 19% of the total energy deposited. At that time instant, the authors 
observed a high dissociation ratio of O2 molecules, up to 33% on the axis 
of the discharge channel [75]. It should be noted that one of the main 
processes  leading  to  fast  gas  heating  is  the  dissociation  of  molecular 
oxygen  in  collisions  with  electronically  excited  N2  molecules.  This 
means that fast gas heating and high dissociation degree of O2 in air are 
interrelated and appear together. This fact was proven experimentally 
for  the  atmospheric  pressure  pin-to-pin  discharge  in  air  preheated  to 
1000 K [70], where the temperature increase by 900 K during 20 ns is

ygen [76].

kinetics 

This  section  contains  detailed  analysis  of  data  on  fast  gas  heating

5.1. Studies of fast air heating in the field range of E/N ≤ 150 Td 

The papers [42,94] considered the heating of N2/O2  mixtures by a 
pulsed microsecond discharge in a tube with a radius of R = 0.5 cm at 
pressures  P = 0.4–1  Torr.  The  average  discharge  current  density  was 
j = 0.5–10 A/cm2 at a pulse duration τ ≤ 100 μs. Gas temperature was 
measured with a time resolution of 1 μs from relative intensities of the

rotational  structure  (v
molecular nitrogen.

Calculations [29], performed for the conditions of the experiments 
[42], show that at t >10 μs both E/N and electron density vary insig-
nificantly,  amounting,  at  j = 1 A/cm2,  to  E/N = 95  ± 2  Td  and 
(cid:0) 3,  respectively.  At  these  times,  an  approximately 
Ne = (2–3)⋅1012  cm
constant rate of gas heating should be expected.

In [42], along with gas heating, kinetic curves of oxygen atoms in 
arbitrary units were measured. The corresponding values of [O(3P)]rel 
were  calculated  based  on  the  measurements  of  relative  emission  in-

Figure 6 shows experimental data [94] (symbols) and the results of 
calculations  [29]  (solid  curves)  of  air  heating  dynamics  near  the 
discharge  axis  at  P = 0.5  Torr.  Curves  1–3  correspond  to  the  average 
values of current density j = 4 A/cm2, 2 A/cm2, and 1 A/cm2 (I = 3.14 A,

agreement  with  experimental  data.  The  dashed  line  represents  the 
calculation for j = 4 A/cm2 without taking into account gas cooling due 
to the thermal conductivity; the difference with solid line 1 at T ≥ 800 K 
is clearly seen.

We  describe  FGH  as  fast  relaxation  of  energy  from  charged  and 
electronically  excited  species  in  reactions  with  atomic  and  molecular 
particles. This is different from relatively slow process of VT-relaxation. 
Fast gas heating is more efficient at high E/N because more energy is 
stored in high energy electronic states of atoms and molecules [26,95]. 
The effect of VT-relaxation acceleration by fast gas heating due to an 
increase in gas temperature at the initial stage of the discharge and thus 
an increase in VT-relaxation rate has been observed experimentally. In 
[67],  measurements  of  gas  heating  were  made  in  a  pulsed  glow 
discharge in air at P = 6 Torr, I = 0.9 A. The discharge tube radius was 
R = 1.5 cm. Radial profiles and time dynamics of gas temperature were 
studied  with  an  optical  interferometry  method.  Under  the  considered 
conditions, E/N varies in the range of 50-70 Td [29] and the main part of 
the discharge energy is spent to vibrational excitation of nitrogen mol-
ecules. The most of gas heating is caused by VT-relaxation in collisions 
with oxygen atoms.

provided in [69]. The discharge was ignited in the point-to-plane gap at 
interelectrode distance d = 6.5 mm and pulse repetition frequency f =
10 Hz. Gas temperature and VDF were measured by spontaneous Raman 
scattering. 

Figure 8 shows the results of discharge current [69] measurements 
(solid black curve), as well as the results of calculated [96] dynamics of 
the specific energy deposition at the plasma channel axis. The waveform 
of  electrical  current  used  in  numerical  simulations  is  shown  as  a  red 
dashed curve, it was used as input data. The main energy release in the 
discharge occurs at field values E/N = 100 ± 20 Td, the maximum value 
of the specific energy deposition reaches W = 0.75 eV/mol. The value of 
the energy deposited in the discharge of 23 mJ resulting from calcula-
tions  [96]  is  close  to  the  experimentally  measured  value  of  ≈ 20  mJ 
[69].

The main relaxation of vibrational excitation of N2(v) occurs in col-
lisions with oxygen atoms O(3P). The change in vibrational temperature

N2 at the discharge axis at t < 10 µs is insignificant. The growth of T01

the  periphery  of  the  discharge  channel  (at  r = 0.7  mm)  at  times

excited  N2(v)  molecules  from  the  near-axis  region  to  the  periphery 
because of gas-dynamic expansion of the channel.

Table 1 compares experimentally measured and calculated values of 
the specific deposited energy in a series of discharge pulses for different 
pressures  [65].  The  main  energy  input  to  the  discharge  is  at 
E/N = 200–400  Td,  which  corresponds  to  the  efficient  excitation  of 
electronic states and dissociation of molecules and, consequently, effi-
cient fast gas heating. 

Figure 12 shows the calculated kinetic curves of oxygen atoms and 
electronically  excited  N2(A3Σ+
u ),  N2(B3Пg),  N2(C3Пu)  molecules  at 
Р = 6 mbar. In addition to the calculations, the results of N2(A3Σ+
u , v = 0) 
density CRDS measurements, in arbitrary units, are shown with symbols. 
One  should  note  a  high  dissociation  degree  of  oxygen  molecules, 
reaching [O(3P)]/[O2] ≈ 10%. 

Calculated  (curves)  and  experimentally  measured  (symbols)  gas 
temperatures for P = 9 and 6 mbar, respectively, is shown in Figure 13. A 
step  corresponding  to  the  second  discharge  pulse  at  250  ns  is  clearly 
seen. A significant part of the discharge energy transforms to gas heating 
in  the  near  afterglow  due  to  quenching  of  the  electronically-excited 
states  of  nitrogen  molecules  by  oxygen  and  quenching  of  excited 
O(1D) atoms by N2. 

The results of calculations [65] show that the discharge energy dis-
tribution in the early afterglow is as follows: approximately 24% of the 
energy is spent on gas heating, 43 to 47%, depending on pressure, – on 
the dissociation of oxygen molecules, and the rest – on the excitation of 
vibrational levels of N2(v). Calculated energy efficiency of atomic oxy-
gen production in a given discharge is G = 18–19 (where G is the number

its  unperturbed  value  P = 760  Torr,  and  starting  from  this  point,  the 
parameters  of  the  channel  can  be  calculated  in  the  isobaric 
approximation. 

Figure 10 (b) shows measurement data and results of calculating atomic 
oxygen density temporal dynamics at the discharge axis. The density of

atoms reaches 2 ⋅ 1018  cm
degree  of  oxygen  dissociation.  A  decrease  in  O(3P)-atoms  density  at 
0.1–2  μs  is  explained  by  the  drop  of  gas  density  due  to  gas-dynamic 
expansion of the hot channel. At the axis, energy fraction spent on fast 
heating at t ≤ 100 ns is about 17%; about 27% is spent on dissociation and 
about 55% on vibrational excitation of nitrogen molecules [96]. 

5.2. Studies of fast air heating in the range of field E/N = 150–400 Td 

Papers [65,97,98] consider heating of nitrogen-oxygen mixtures at 
P = 3–9  mbar  in  a  pulsed  nanosecond  discharge.  The  discharge  was 
triggered by a sequence of 2–3 pulses, in a duration of 20 ns at FWHM 
and a pause between pulses was about 250 ns. Specific energy deposited 
in  the  discharge  reached  0.08–0.13  eV/molecule.  Calculations  were 
based on the measured waveform of the discharge current. Figure 11 
shows an example of the measurements (solid curves) and the calcula-
tion results (dashed curves) of E/N behavior for P = 9 mbar. It is clearly 
seen that the agreement of the calculations and measurements is rather 
good, and so allows adequate description of plasma-chemical processes 
with the model.

heating dynamics for the discharge pulse with the parameters given in 
Figure  14.  The  rate  of  gas  heating  is  extremely  high,  (3–5)⋅1010  K/s. 
About 25% of the discharge energy transforms into gas heating under 
the considered conditions [96]. The discharge is characterized by a high 
molecular oxygen dissociation degree at high E/N, a parameter closely 
linked to high efficiency of fast gas heating. 

The  density  of  O(3P)  atoms  was  measured  in  [73,101]  using  a

Evolution  of  a  single  plasma  channel  of  a  pin-to-pin  nanosecond 
discharge in atmospheric pressure air is provided in [70,73,101,102]. 
Numerical modelling of the discharge parameters was considered in a 
one-dimensional  axisymmetric  formulation  [96].  This  approximation 
seems  justified,  since  under the  conditions  of  [70,73,101,102], radial 
gradients of the plasma parameters exceed significantly axial gradients.

where U(t) measured in [73] is voltage value, Uc – the cathode potential

in the discharge under study is at field values E/N = 100–200 Td, and the 
maximum  energy  deposit  reaches  W = 0.8  eV/mol.  The  energy  input 
into the discharge (0.67 mJ) resulting from calculations [96] is close to

Quenching of N2(B3Пg, C3Пu, a
u ) can alternatively result in forma-
tion of N2(A3Σ+
u ) molecules followed by the generation of atomic oxygen 
in reaction (A5). We will call this approach "model 2"; it was suggested 
in [104] based on measurements of O(3P) atom density in the afterglow 
of  a  pulsed  nanosecond  discharge.  Results  of  calculations  [96]  using 
models 1 (curve 1) and 2 (curve 2) are shown in Figure 16. Only model 1 
is in a good agreement with experimental data [73]. This allows us to 
conclude  that  quenching  of  electronically  excited  states  of  N2(B3Пg, 
С3Пu, a

Significant  energy  release  during  a  short  time  interval  leads  to 
noticeable  hydrodynamic  perturbation.  Paper  [71]  provides  measure-
ment data and simulation results of the gas-dynamic phenomena initi-
ated by a pulsed-periodic nanosecond discharge with parameters close 
to [73].  The studies  were held  in atmospheric pressure air at various 
initial gas temperatures in the range of 300–1000 K. The discharge was 
initiated by HV pulses with a duration of 10 ns at repetition frequency 
f = 1-10 kHz. Energy deposition in each pulse was approximately 1 mJ. 
Gas  density  at  times  t = 50  ns–3  μs  after  the  discharge  was  obtained 
using Schlieren technique. The resulting data was compared with the 
results of calculations made using a 1D axisymmetric model with a given 
radial  heat  source  profile.  This  resulted  in  the  dependence  of  energy 
fraction spent on fast gas heating ηR on the value of E/N in the discharge: 
ηR varied from 25% at E/N = 164 Td to 75% at E/N = 270 Td. It should 
be noted, however, that in air at E/N = 250– 300 Td, about 40–50% of 
the discharge energy is spent on dissociation of oxygen molecules [96, 
100], therefore ηR value should not exceed 50% in this range of electric 
fields (see curve II in Figure 1). The fraction of energy that goes to O2 
O2  = 5.12 eV is the dissoci-
O2 /2G, where Ediss

ation energy of O2  molecules [93],G is the energy cost of O-atom pro-
duction [100]. That is, value ηR ≈ 75% obtained in [71] at E/N = 270 Td 
appears to be overestimated. 

One  of  the  important  parameters  used  in  [71]  for  the  analysis  of 
measurement is the radius of the heat release zone R0. Depending on 
initial gas temperature, value R0 varied from R0 = 200 μm at T0 = 300 K 
to R0 = 480 μm at T0 = 1000 K. These data were obtained on the basis of 
Schlieren  measurements  at  the  50th  nanosecond  after  the  discharge 
pulse. 

Figure 17 shows the results of comparing calculated and measured 
contrast profiles at different times for the following conditions: case 1: 
U = 7.5 kV, f = 1 kHz, d = 2 mm, T0 = 300 K; case 2: U = 8.1 kV, f = 1 
kHz,  d = 4  mm,  T0 = 1000  K  [71].  The  calculations  were  performed 
assuming a Gaussian initial distribution of the heat release source with

characteristic radius R0. In case 1, the experimental contrast curve and 
the results of modelling at R0 = 200 μm are in a good agreement, and the 
efficiency of fast gas heating is ηR = 0.25 ± 0.1. In case 2, the experi-
mental maximum "contrast", i.e. the maximum of gas density gradient, is 
achieved at smaller radii than in the calculations at R0 = 380 μm. This 
may indicate the use of an overestimated value of R0 in the model in case 
2. Besides, this case resulted in extremely high energy efficiency of fast 
gas  heating  ηR = 0.65  ± 0.15.  For  additional  validation  of  the  results 
provided by [71], it would be interesting to measure characteristic di-
mensions of the energy deposition region based on the radial profiles of 
the  radiation  intensity  of  2
nitrogen  system,  similar  to  [70],  and 
compare the resulting radius to R0 value.

5.3. Studies of fast air heating in the range of field E/N > 400 Td 

At E/N ≤ 200–300 Td, about 70% of fast gas heating is explained by 
quenching  of  N2(B3Пg),  N2(C3Пu)  electronically  excited  states  by  mo-
lecular oxygen and by quenching of O(1D) atoms by N2 [64,65]. With an 
increase  in  E/N  value,  the  role  of  electron  impact  dissociation  of  N2 
molecules and  processes involving charged  particles increases, and at 
E/N > 600–700 Td, it becomes dominant [64,66] (see Figure 4). 

Paper  [66]  considered  the  interaction  of  weak  shock  waves 
(M = 1.5–3)  with  plasma  region  generated  in  air  at  P = 20  Torr  by  a 
pulsed high-current nanosecond discharge with the following parame-
ters: pulse duration τimp  ≤ 50 ns, voltage U = 100–160 kV, maximum 
current  Imax  ≈ 2  kA.  The  results  of  measurements  of  the  shock  wave 
velocity V/V0 increase during propagation through plasma region were 
provided. The authors [66] concluded that the velocity increases due to 
heat release in plasma region and that up to 40% of discharge energy at 
E/N = 600 Td is spent on gas heating. 

Another  experiment  in  [66]  was  dedicated  to  measuring  gas  tem-
perature in a nanosecond surface dielectric barrier discharge in air at 
atmospheric pressure. These measurements were used to estimate the 
fraction  of  discharge  energy  spent  on  fast  gas  heating.  SDBD  at  high 
pressures consists of separate streamers; therefore spatial distribution of 
the specific  input energy is essentially non-uniform (see Figure 2). In 
[66], the data on emission intensity distribution for the 2
molecular 
nitrogen system were used to analyze plasma spatial distribution. It was 
assumed that emission intensity is proportional to the specific delivered 
energy, which is identical to the assumption of the constant energy cost 
of generating N2(C3Пu) molecules in the range of fields under consid-
eration. This assumption is not always correct and should be thoroughly 
analyzed for each particular case. 

+

The discharge energy fraction ηR spent on fast gas heating in a pulsed 
nanosecond  discharge  in  air  at  P = 450–760  Torr  (Figure  18)  was 
measured  in [77].  It  was  shown that the  value  of ηR  almost  does  not 
depend on gas pressure and is equal to ηR = 40–95%, depending on the 
applied voltage and oxygen fraction in the mixture (dashed curves in 
Fig. 18). The paper also provided the results of calculating ηR  depen-
dence on E/N value in the discharge. The dependence of ηR on pressure 
resulting from the calculations is stronger than in the experiment. This is 
a consequence of the fact that, at high electric fields, a significant part of 
the discharge energy goes to ionization. Further relaxation of this energy 
to heating, according to [66,77], depends strongly on gas pressure, as 
the  composition  of  positive  ions  changes  considerably  with  pressure, 
leading  to a change in the fraction of energy spent on gas heating in 
electron-ion recombination reactions. 

It is seen from Figure 18 that immediately after the discharge ηR  =
6–18%,  but  at  time  interval  t = 0.1–1  μs,  ηR  increases  to  60–90%  at 
pressures P ≥ 600 Torr. It is not possible to explain this effect using the 
existing  models  of  fast  gas  heating  which  include  quenching  of  elec-
tronically excited species and recombination of charged particles: the 
typical time of the mentioned processes is less than 100 ns. This state-
ment is confirmed by experimental data [69], analyzed in the previous 
section: according to the data given in Figure 10(a), gas temperature in 
the discharge and the afterglow increases at t < 60 ns but remains almost 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience91(2022)10092813N.A. Popov and S.M. Starikovskaia                                                                                                                                                                                                         

constant at t = 0.1–1 μs. So the explanation of a significant increase of 
gas temperature and efficiency of fast gas heating at t = 0.1–1 μs, ob-
tained experimentally in [66,77], still remains open. 

There  are  a  few  experimental  difficulties  which  can  influence  the 
results of measurements [66,77]. First, it is extremely difficult to mea-
sure the discharge region volume and specific input energy value with 
acceptable accuracy, since the SDBD discharge at atmospheric pressure 
is  significantly  inhomogeneous  in  space.  Second,  for  SDBD  measure-
ments of the efficient reduced electric field (E/N)eff at which most of the 
discharge  energy  is  deposited  in  gas  is  a  very  complex  problem.  Ac-
cording to modern considerations [54,61,105,106], the distribution of 
E/N  in  the  SDBD  discharge  at  atmospheric  pressure  is  strongly 
non-uniform: the fields are extremely high in the ionization front and 
relatively low, about 100 Td, in the discharge channel. A region of high 
electric field exists between the plasma channel and the dielectric sur-
face [54,61,90], but the electron density in this region, and thus the role 
of  this  layer  in  the  energetic  balance  of  the  discharge,  is  small.  As  a 
result, the main energy deposition should occur after the front at the 
field values E/N ≈ 100 Td, and the role of the high electric field region in 
the  front  of  the  discharge  decreases  with  an  increase  in  the  channel 
length. 

To summarize, when E/N > 600 Td, not related to the mentioned 
experimental difficulties, the processes involving charged particles play 
an  important  role  in the  mechanism of  fast  gas  heating.  For  most  re-
actions  of  electron-ion  and  ion-ion  recombination,  as  well  as  for  ion- 
molecular  reactions,  there  are  no  data  on  the  energy  distribution  in 
the degrees of freedom for the products of these reactions. Therefore, 
according  to  [66,77],  only  preliminary  estimates  of  energy  fraction 
spent  on  fast  heating  of  nitrogen-oxygen  mixtures  in  gas-discharge 
plasma at high E/N are possible at this stage. 

6. Theoretical research. Analysis of the kinetic model 

A  kinetic  model  describing  the  dynamics  of  the  main  nitrogen- 
oxygen  mixture  components  excited  by  a  discharge  with  a  relatively 
strong  reduced  electric  field  was  proposed  in  [29,64].  A  significant 
fraction of the discharge energy at high E/N is consumed by the elec-
tronic degrees of freedom, dissociation and ionization of molecules. It 
was  assumed  that  the  main  electron  impact  excitation  of  atoms  and 
molecules in the discharge is from the ground electronic state. Е/N de-
pendences of the rates of the corresponding reactions were calculated 
using BOLSIG+ free software [72]. The change of rate constants with the 
increasing  degree  of  vibrational  excitation  of  N2  molecules  was 
described similar to [107]. The main reactions involving neutral parti-
cles and rate constants can be found in [29,103,108,26]. To describe the 
dynamics of gas heating in the discharge, the model [29,64] took into 
account the following heat release processes:

Dissociation of N2 and O2 proceeds via pre-dissociation of electron-

impact  from  the  ground  state.  The  kinetic  energy  of  the  products  of 
pre-dissociation reactions εR can be significant:

where εth is the energy threshold of electron-impact excitation of the pre-

In air, at high E/N values, a significant part of the discharge energy 
can be consumed by dissociation of nitrogen molecules. As a rule, for 
E/N  > 100  Td,  the  main  source  of  nitrogen  atoms  are  rapidly  pre- 
(cid:0) 1 [111,112]) singlet states of N*
dissociating (~1010 s
= N2(b1Πu, c1Πu,
o1Πu, e1Πu, b1Σ+
, e1Σ+
, c1Σ+
) etc.  with  excitation  energy  exceeding 
12.25 eV. In [112], it was shown that these electronically excited states 
pre-dissociate with generation of N(4S) + N(2D) atoms. Thus, no more 
than  εth–εdiss  ≤ 1  eV  can  be  spent  directly  to  the  gas  heating  in  this 
process (εth  ≈ 13 eV is the effective threshold of electron-impact exci-
tation  of  these  states,  εdiss = 12.1  eV  is  the  dissociation  limit  corre-
sponding to N(4S) + N(2D) products). The generated N(2D) atoms react 
fairly fast with O2 molecules [103,108] (see reaction (R15) in Table 2) 
with the production of excited O(1D) atoms. Their quenching (see sec-
tion  6.3  below)  also  leads  to  gas  heating.  Taking  into  account  rapid 
relaxation of NO vibrational excitation, approximately 2.99 eV can be 
transformed to heat release in reaction (R15), and the total energy going 
to gas heating during dissociation of nitrogen molecules (e + N2 → e + N 
(4S) + N(2D)) can reach 4 eV, which is about of 30% of the excitation 
energy εth. 

6.2. Quenching of electronically excited states of nitrogen by oxygen

u ,v), О2(с1Σ(cid:0)

Quenching of electronically excited nitrogen molecules by O2 leads 
to the population of О2(B3Σ(cid:0)
u ,v), О2(А3Σ+
u ,v) excited states. 
Pre-dissociation of these states leads to the decomposition of O2  mole-
cules and the excess energy release into translational degrees of freedom 
of  the  generated  oxygen  atoms  [113].  Thermalization  of  “hot”  atoms 
takes place in a few collisions, and the energy released in this case is 
consumed  primarily  by  rotational  excitation  of  molecules  and  gas 
heating. 

The main reactions of electronically excited states of N2 in nitrogen-

dissociation [64,115]. The most efficient way to describe their kinetics is 
to introduce effective state N2(B), with a population rate determined by 
the total concentration of molecules in these electronic states and with a 
quenching rate determined via the corresponding data on the N2(B3Пg)

between N2(B3Пg, B
Similar considerations are also valid for the group of singlet states 
N2(a1Пg, a
u , w1Δu) [116]  described in  the model [64]  by a  single 
state N2(a). The deactivation rate of N2(a) was assumed to be equal to 
quenching rate of N2(a
u ) [117]. Analyzing the scheme of electronic 
terms of the singlet states in nitrogen molecule [29] makes it possible to 
suggest that quenching of N2(a
u ) by oxygen leads to dissociation of 
O2  molecules  primarily  through  the  B3Σ(cid:0)
u  state  (reaction  (R8)  from 
Table 2).

Consider  a  possibility  of  gas  heating  in  the  process  of  N2(C3Пu) 
quenching  by  molecular  oxygen  (R10).  The  rate  of  this  reaction  is 
(cid:0) 10  cm3/s  [82,114],  so  this  process  should  play  an 
k = (2.5–3)⋅10
important role in mixtures where the fraction of oxygen is great enough, 
for example, in the air. In [96], it was shown that the main result of 
reaction (R10) is dissociation of O2  molecules (see Table 2). To deter-
mine  the  fraction  of  N2(C3Пu,v)  excitation  energy  consumed  by  gas 
heating, we should calculate the ratio of dissociation channels leading to 
generation of O(3P), O(1D), O(1S) atoms. In [64], it was assumed that the 
ratio  of  (O(3P) + O(3P)),  (O(1D) + O(3P)),  (O(1S) + O(3P))  dissociation 
channels  in  reaction  (R10)  is  approximately  the  same  as  in  oxygen 
quenching of excited argon atoms Ar(3P0,2) (excitation energy 11.6 eV) 
and is, according to measurements [118], 0.46:0.52:0.02. Then the total 
energy of the resulting fragments of O(3P,1D,1S) + O(3P) is εdiss = 6.2 eV. 
At high dissociation degrees, [O(3P)]/[O2], quenching of electroni-
cally excited nitrogen molecules by oxygen atoms becomes important. 
For  N2(A3Σ+
u )  molecules,  this  process  was  studied  in  detail  in  [119]. 
Recently, in the afterglow of the pulsed nanosecond discharge in air at 
P = 100 Torr and T = 300–350 K [120] on the basis of experimentally 
measured kinetic curves of O(3P), N(4S) atoms and NO molecules, the 
(cid:0) 10  cm3/s,  were  ob-
rate  constant  of  reactions  (R12)-(R14),  k = 3⋅10
tained. Taking into account subsequent reactions of N(2D) quenching by 
molecular oxygen (R15) and rapid VT- relaxation of NO(v), the fraction 
of electronic excitation energy of N2(A3Σ+
u ) molecules 
consumed by gas heating in reactions (R12)-(R15), is significant. Note

Deactivation of O(1D) by nitrogen molecules has been studied in a 
number of papers where it has been shown that this reaction proceeds 
with the formation of an intermediate complex. The reaction rate values 
resulting  from  calculations  of  [121]  are  in  good  agreement  with 
experimental data, and measurements of [122] confirmed the calculated 
value of the energy fraction (30 ± 10%) spent on N2  vibrational exci-
tation. Based on the results of these studies, it was assumed [29] that 
about 70% of O(1D) excitation energy is consumed by gas heating, that 
is, for reaction (R16) ε16 ≈ 1.38 eV. 

6.4. Ion-molecular reactions, electron-ion and ion-ion recombination 

In air, for E/N > 400 Td, a significant part of the discharge energy is 
consumed by ionization of nitrogen and oxygen molecules. Therefore, at 
high E/N values, reactions involving charged particles can make a sig-
nificant contribution to gas heating [66]. The system of reactions given 
in Table 3 was used in [64] to describe the evolution of ionic compo-
sition in nitrogen/oxygen mixtures.

[124,127,128] et al. So, the energy consumed by gas heating in reaction 
(C11) does not exceed εС11 ≤ 4.6 eV. 

In [66], it was assumed that both in reaction (C11) and in reactions 
of three-body ion-ion recombination (C20)-(C23), dissociation of oxy-
gen molecules is unlikely, and the main channels are:

4 + e→2⋅O2, O(cid:0)

2 + O+

2 + O2→3⋅O2, O(cid:0)

4 + O+

4 + O2→5⋅O2,

moreover, all the energy released in these processes is consumed by gas 
heating.  The  analysis  of  this  assumption,  as  well  as  the  analysis  of 
experimental data on energy efficiency of ozone production by electron 
beams [124,127] can be found in [64]. 

Will  consider  possible  uncertainties  in  the  modeling  of  the  fast  gas 
heating linked to uncertainties in the key elementary reactions in N2:O2 
mixtures.  In  the  field  range  E/N = 60–300  Td,  the  main  reactions 
responsible  for  the  fast  gas  heating  are  quenching  of  electronically 
excited states N2(A3Σ+
u ), N2(B3Пg), N2(C3Пu) by O2  molecules, dissoci-
ation of O2 and N2 by electron impact, and quenching of excited O(1D) 
atoms by molecular nitrogen (see Figure 4). 

Production of electronically excited N2(A3Σ+

u ), N2(B3Пg), N2(C3Пu) 
molecules takes place mainly via direct electron impact from the ground 
state  of  molecular  nitrogen.  The  rates  of  excitation  are  calculated  by 
solving  the  Boltzmann equation  in the  two-term  approximation using 
the  BOLSIG+ code  [72].  Self-consistent  set  of  the  cross-sections  for 
elastic and inelastic electron collisions with N2 molecules is taken from 
[129].  These  cross-sections  have  been  tested  in  numerous  papers 
comparing  calculated  and  measured  swarm  parameters,  namely  drift 
velocities and ionization coefficients, as well as excitation of N2(C3Пu) 
state  and  excitation  of  the  sum  of  triplet  electronic  states  N2(A3Σ+
u ), 
N2(B3Пg),  N2(C3Пu)  for  different  E/N  values  (see,  for  example,  [129, 
130] etc). Using these cross-sections for calculation of the rate constants 
in air and combustible mixtures introduces an error in the rate constants 
of around 10–20% [131]. 

Table 2 contains the rate constants for the reactions of quenching of 
electronically excited states N2(A3Σ+
u ), N2(B3Пg), N2(C3Пu) by molecular 
oxygen (reactions (R1), (R2), (R6) and (R10)). The values of the taken 
rate constants are in a good agreement with numerous literature sources 
[26,82,95,103,108]. Will note that change of these reaction rates in the 
limits given in the literature will not change an absolute value of tem-
perature increase at the conditions that the considered reactions (R1), 
(R2), (R6), (R10) are the dominant channels of quenching of N2(A3Σ+
u , 
B3Пg, C3Пu). 

One of the key reactions for fast gas heating are the dissociation of O2 
molecules by electron impact. A self-consistent set of electron collision 

cross-sections for oxygen molecules is described and analyzed in [132, 
133]. In oxygen plasma using these cross-sections for calculation of the 
rate constants of O2  dissociation introduces an error of about 10-15% 
[133]. It should be noted that electronically excited O(1D) atoms can be 
produced due to O2  dissociation; their quenching is also important for 
the FGH. The accuracy of the rate constants of quenching of O(1D) atoms 
by N2 and O2 molecules (reactions (R16) and (R17) from the table 2) is 
about 20% [134]. Cross-section of N2 dissociation by electron impact, as 
well as part of energy transmitted in gas heating in dissociation is dis-
cussed in [112]. There is no enough data in the literature to estimate the 
error  of  resulting  rates  of  dissociation  (see,  for  example,  [135]),  but 
according to the calculations provided in Figure 4, curve 4, the role of N2 
dissociation in air at low and moderate electric fields is relatively small 
and does not exceed 12% at E/N < 300 Td. 

The main mechanism of production of atomic oxygen in air plasma at 
high electric fields is based on O2  dissociation by electron impact and 
dissociative quenching of N2(A3Σ+
u , B3Пg, C3Пu) states by oxygen mol-
ecules described above. This provides a solid ground for validation of the 
rate constants of key elementary reactions for the fast gas heating, since 
all the reactions of O2 dissociation are accompanied by fast heat release 
[64].  Corresponding  calculations  show  agreement in  time profile  and 
absolute values of atomic oxygen, within 30-40%, with experimentally 
obtained TALIF-data [70] (see Figure 16). Another comparison provides 
20–30% difference between calculated [30] and measured [136] energy 
efficiency of O(3P) atoms production for the reduced electric fields in the 
range E/N = 150–350 Td. 

It  should  be  noted  that  further  research  is  needed  to  develop  and 
validate the model of fast gas heating in discharge plasmas at high gas 
pressures 
reduced  electric  fields 
(E/N = 600–1000 Td).

7. Fast gas heating in discharge plasma of hydrogen-air mixtures 
and its effect on the ignition of combustible mixtures 

In hydrogen-containing mixtures, even at fuel-to-oxidizer ratio close 
to stoichiometric, the density of hydrogen exceeds the density of oxygen: 
[H2]/[O2]  ≥ 1.  This  is  the  difference  between  hydrogen-containing 
mixtures  and  mixtures  containing  hydrocarbons  where  ratio  [CxHy]/ 
[O2] < 1 even at ER = 1. At ER > 0.3, due to the relatively great fraction 
of hydrogen in the H2-air mixture, processes involving hydrogen mole-
cules can play a significant role in the thermalization of non-equilibrium 
excitation energy. 

Figure 19 shows the results of calculating the distribution of electron 
energy  loss  into  various  degrees  of  freedom  as  a  function  of  E/N  in 
stoichiometric H2-air mixture [2]. In the range of fields E/N = 8–300 Td, 
most of the discharge energy goes to electronic excitation of nitrogen 
and hydrogen molecules, as well as dissociation of oxygen molecules by 
electron impact. To describe  fast gas heating in hydrogen-air plasma, 
consider  the  possibility  of  gas  heating  in  the  relaxation  of  electron 
excitation energy for hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen molecules. Disso-
ciation of hydrogen molecules by electron impact

ergy of H2  molecules, εdiss = 4.478 eV [93], is released to gas heating 
[137]. 

As  already  noted,  in  hydrogen-air  mixtures,  at  E/N  > 100  Td,  a 
significant  fraction  of  the  discharge  energy  can  be  consumed  by  the 
electronic  excitation  of  N2(A3Σ+

cules. Compare the rates of quenching these electronically excited states

As a result, the difference between the excitation energy of N2(C3Пu) 
(11.03  eV)  and  the  dissociation  energy  of  H2  (4.478  eV)  goes  to  gas 
heating. The role of reaction (Q6) in fast gas heating can be significant, 
since  the  rate  constant  of  this  reaction  is  high  [82]  and  a  significant 
fraction of the excitation energy of N2(C3Пu) can be spent on gas heat-
ing: εQ6 ≈ 6.5 eV. 

Another important process that can make a significant contribution 
to  rapid  heating  of  H2-air  mixtures  is  the  quenching  of  electronically

Figures  23,  24  show  the  measured  data  on  the  dynamics  of  OH 
radical concentration and gas temperature after the discharge in a 30% 
H2-air mixture for various values of the energy applied [140]. Here, the 
minimum ignition energy is εmin = 0.048 mJ. According to these data, at 
t = 5–20 μs after the discharge, gas temperature reaches 1000–1100 K, 
that  is,  gas  heating  is  ΔT = 700–800  K.  Taking  into  account  the 
gas-dynamic rarefaction of the channel, which characteristic time in this 
case  does  not  exceed  500  ns,  the  specific  energy  consumed  by  gas 
heating  is  Wh  ≈ 0.226  eV/mol.  This  involves  both  heat  release  in 
quenching reactions of electronically excited atoms and molecules (see 
Figure  21)  and  heat  release  in  chemical  reactions  proceeding  in  a 
combustible mixture. 

Under  conditions  of  [140],  the  main  energy  release  is  at 
E/N = 130–150 Td. In these fields, about half of the discharge energy is 
consumed  by  vibrational  excitation  of  N2  and  H2  molecules  (see 
Figure  19).  Therefore,  relaxation  of  vibrational  excitation  of  these 
molecules  is  important.  According  to  Figure  20,  at  gas  temperature

data on the rate constants of these reactions given in Refs. [30,64,95] 
can be used. These data are shown in Figure 20. 

Figure 21 shows a comparative analysis of the distribution of energy 
consumed by fast gas heating for the reactions with excited species and 
dissociation by electron impact. These data correspond to the stoichio-
metric  H2-air  mixture.  The  fraction  of  reactions  involving  hydrogen 
molecules  increases  from  43%  to  60%  with  an  increase  in  reduced 
electric field E/N from 60 to 200 Td. The main role belongs to the re-
action of H2 dissociation by electron impact and the quenching reaction 
of N2(C3Пu) by hydrogen molecules. 

Gas temperature and the density of OH radicals under the action of a 
pulsed  nanosecond  discharge  were  measured  in  [140]  in  30%  H2-air 
mixture  at  P0 = 1  atm  and  T0 = 300  K.  To  ignite  the  combustible 
mixture, a pin-to-pin spark nanosecond discharge located in the middle 
of the combustion chamber, was used. The interelectrode distance was

Paper  [141]  provides  the  results  of  numerical  simulation  of  the 
pulsed  nanosecond  discharge  parameters  in  hydrogen-air  mixtures  at 
atmospheric pressure and initial temperature equal to T0 = 1000 K. The 
studies were made using a 2D axisymmetric model for a set of equiva-
lence ratios ER = 0, 0.3, 1 and 1.5. Nanosecond voltage of 2 ns rise time, 
5.5 ns duration and 5 kV voltage amplitude was used in the calculations. 
The processes of fast gas heating in high-pressure hydrogen-air mixtures 
were taken into account. During the streamer stage and up to the for-
mation of a plasma channel between two pin-to-pin electrodes, a change 
in  the  mixture  composition  only  weakly  influenced  the  discharge  dy-
namics and structure. Generation of main active species O(3P), H, OH 
and an increase in gas temperature occurred as a result of quenching of 
electronically  excited states N2(A3Σ+
u ), N2(B3Пg), N2(C3Пu) by oxygen 
and hydrogen molecules, and quenching of electronically excited O(1D) 
atoms by hydrogen molecules. 

Distribution of electron density, O, H atom density and gas temper-
ature along the discharge axis for H2-air ER = 0.3 mixture immediately 
after the discharge is shown in Figure 25. The densities of radicals and 
gas heating by the discharge show pronounced maxima near the elec-
trodes. This effect is due to a smaller radius of the discharge channel and, 
accordingly, higher current density and specific energy input in these 
regions.  Considering  higher  fast  gas  heating  near  the  electrodes,  it  is 
essential  to  adequately  describe  the  combustible  mixture  ignition  dy-
namics and combustion wave formation. 

8. Ignition of hydrocarbon-based mixtures and fast gas heating 

Reviews  on  plasma-assisted  combustion  [2,52]  discuss  the  lack  of 
cross-sections of interaction between electrons and hydrocarbon mole-
cules.  During  the  past  3–4  decades,  the  study  of  electron  scattering 
cross-sections for hydrocarbon-containing gas mixtures was motivated 
by the development of the microelectronics. Cross-sections available for 
acetylene  and  alkanes  from  methane  to  pentane  are  structured  and 
reviewed in [142]. Special attention is given to the presence/absence of 
the  swarm  parameters  (ionization  coefficient  and  drift  velocity), 
cross-sections  of  ionization  and  attachment,  and  comparison  of  the 
available  data  with  those  for  the  other  hydrocarbons.  Besides  these 
cross-sections,  there  are sets  of  cross-sections for  CO2,  NO2,  N2O, O3, 
H2O, NH3, CH2O2, C2H4, C2H6, CH3OH, C3H4, C2H4O, CH3NH2, C3H6, 
C3H8,  c-C3H6,  C3H6O,  C4H6,  1,3-C4H6,  2-C4H6,  C6H6,  C4H8,  1-C3H8O, 
2-C3H8O,  C5H10,  C6H14,  C6H12,  i-C4H10,  i-C8H18,  C8H18,  C4H8O, 
C5H10O2, C7H8. For complex molecules, only the selected cross-sections 
are typically known.

facilitating 

Ionization thresholds for the most of hydrocarbons are lower than for 
O2 (12.1 eV) or N2 (15.6 eV) molecules [93]. For linear alkanes CnH2n+2, 
ionization threshold decreases from 11.63 eV for C2H6  to 10.03 eV for 
C7H16, 
stoichiometric 
hydrocarbon-containing  mixtures,  the  density  of  molecular  oxygen 
dominates over the density of hydrocarbon [CxHy] << [O2]. As a result, 
the frequency of hydrocarbon ionization is low comparing to ionization 
frequency of N2 and O2. Kinetic calculations does not show crucial dif-
ference in energy branching for air and fuel-air stoichiometric mixtures; 
the  main  ionization  and  dissociation  channels  typically  remain  un-
changed. This is illustrated by Figure 26, where the rate constants of the 
main emitting state N2(C3Πu) excitation and total ionization

are compared for air and N2/O2/C2H6 = 0.76/0.19/0.05 mixture. It is 
clearly seen that 5% of ethane in air does not change the considered rate 
constants.

CH4 = 0.715/0.19/0.095, at P = 1 atm, T = 300 K [150]. 

It  should  be  noted  that  most  of  comprehensive  kinetic  studies  of 
plasma action on hydrocarbon-containing mixtures are done for strongly 
diluted  conditions  and  for  low  specific  delivered  energies  (see,  for 
example, [143,144]). In particular, it was shown in [145] that a small 
amount  of  methane  addition  (1%)  in  He  will  nonlinearly  affects  the 
electron energy and number density. These studies are very important 
for determining the kinetic pathways and for studying energy transfer 
from electronically excited atoms and molecules to dissociation of ox-
ygen  and hydrocarbon  but do  not provide  information about  fast gas 
heating.  For  this  reason,  below  we  consider  mainly  experiments  and 
modeling in fuel-air mixtures. 

For the most of discharges, whether plasma will be uniform or not, is 
determined at the stage of the discharge inception. Transient discharges 
propagate  in  the  form  of  fast  ionization  wave  at  moderate  pressures 
[52], or streamer discharge at high pressures [146] with a well-defined 
zone  of  high  electric  fields  in  the  front.  Two  processes  are  the  most 
important in the front and in the vicinity of the discharge front: ioni-
zation by electron impact and photoionization. Ionization by electron 
impact  is  typically  the  strongest  process  providing  the  majority  of 
electrons.  Photoionization, although a  few order  of  magnitude lower, 
ensures the density of seed electrons and the uniformity of plasma in the 
close vicinity of the front. 

A  classical  model  of  photoionization  in  air  is  given  in  [147]  and 
analyzed in details in [148]. The model is limited by low current dis-
charges  where  the  UV  radiation  comes  mainly  from  electronically

excited singlet states of nitrogen, namely N2(b1Π, b’1Σu
, c1Πu, c’1Σu
). 
Photoionization  occurs  upon  absorption  of  this  radiation  by  oxygen 
molecules  in  wavelength  range  λ = 98–102.5  nm  (energies  of  the  UV 
radiation  of  12.6–12.09  eV).  According  to  the  model  [147],  at  lower 
wavelength,  the  radiation  is  absorbed  by  N2  molecules,  and  at 
λ > 102.5 nm, the photon energy is below the ionization threshold of O2 
molecules. Comparison of emission spectra, absorption and ionization 
yield given in [148] shows that at λ < 98 nm, the UV emission comes 
mainly from atoms and atomic ions of nitrogen and oxygen, and their 
densities are typically low in the front of the discharge. 

Consider addition of hydrocarbons in air. Absorption of UV radiation 
by  hydrocarbons  is  very  efficient; in  the  series  of  alkanes,  the  photo-
absorption  cross-section  for  λ = 100  nm  radiation  increases  from 
(cid:0) 17  cm2  for  n-butane,  respectively 
4⋅10
[149]. 

(cid:0) 17  cm2  for  methane  to  9⋅10

As a result, different physics provide similar results for methane and 
higher  hydrocarbons.  For  methane,  absorption  of  UV  radiation  from 
singlet  states  of  molecular  nitrogen  in  the  “classical”  UV-window  of 
98-102.5 nm is high. Although the ionization yield of CH4 is low and UV 
photons mainly cause dissociation of CH4, absorption of UV radiation by 
methane  provides fast decay of  the photoionization  coefficient  or the 
photoionization rate (the ratio of the rate of production of photoelec-
trons  in  the  collector  volume  to  the  rate  of  ionizing  collisions  in  the 
discharge, divided by a solid angle, gas pressure and path length of ra-
diation)  with  distance.  This  is  illustrated  by  Figure  27,  where  the 
photoionization  coefficient  is  plotted  as  a  function  of  distance

pressure 
[150] 
N2/O2/CH4 = 0.715/0.19/0.095. It is clearly seen that even at 400 μm 
from  the  source  of  radiation  (an  emitting  atom  or  molecule  in  the 
considered case), the photoionization rate in air is more than one order 
of magnitude higher comparing to methane-containing mixture.

and

in 

For  higher  hydrocarbons,  absorption  of  UV  radiation  provides 
photoionization because of lower ionization threshold and thus higher 
values of photoionization yield at the given wavelengths. But similar to 
methane-containing mixtures, the emission is absorbed at much shorter 
distances,  and  thus,  it  is  more  complicated  to  get  uniform  plasma  in 
hydrocarbon-containing mixtures comparing to air. 

Experimental observations prove the considerations given above and 
show  formation  of  а  multi-channel  structure  and  constriction  of  dis-
charges with additions of hydrocarbon. The authors of [151] report on 
an increase in branching with the increasing fuel content in the mixture 
(Figure 28). These data are in good agreement with the data of other 
authors:  constriction  of  moderate  pressure  (P = 40  Torr)  nanosecond 
discharge in ethylene-air mixtures with ER = 0.1 and 0.01 has been re-
ported in [104]; a significant dependence of the results upon the spatial 
structure of the discharge was directly confirmed by comparative study 
of  the  ignition  of  C3H8/air  and  C7H16/air  mixtures  at  atmospheric 
pressure and temperature [152]. 

The  authors  [151]  point  out  that,  despite  noticeable  macroscopic 
differences in different mixtures – appearing of branching and the fact 
that the discharge pulses in richer mixtures were audibly louder – the 
measured electrical characteristics remained essentially identical, with 
no more than 5% variation in pulse width, peak current, peak voltage 
and energy delivered. On the contrary, the authors [3] report on sig-
nificant,  six  times  decrease  of  the  energy  delivered  in  the  discharge, 
increasing  CH4  density  in  the  CH4/O2/Ar  mixture  from  ER = 0.3  to 
ER = 1. 

The general conclusion is that noticeable branching of the discharge 
is observed when adding even a few percent of CxHy  in air. A physical 
reason for filamentation and formation of а multi-channel structure is a 
decrease in a typical absorption length and thus, a significant drop in the 
rate  of  photoinization  comparing  to  hydrocarbon-free  mixture.  Fila-
mentation leads to a local increase in the specific delivered energy, and 
inevitably, to an increased fast gas heating. 

Similar effect, namely a decrease in the density of photoelectrons, is 
observed  when  passing  from  air  to  mixtures  with  lower  densities  of 
molecular oxygen. The results of 3D PIC-MCC calculations in N2/20% O2 
and  N2/0.2%  O2  mixtures  at  time  points  t = 1.5,  2.5  and  3.5  ns,  are 
shown  in  Figure  29  [153].  A  decrease  in  discharge  uniformity  and 
branching similar to the mixtures with additions of hydrocarbons, are 
clearly seen. 

Another effect important for CxHy/O2 mixtures is thermal instability 
of  the  discharge  and  so  the  redistribution  of  the  specific  delivered 
discharge  energy.  This  effect  is  clearly  demonstrated  in  [154]  for 
pulse-periodic  discharge  in  CH4/O2/Ar = 6.6/13.4/80  mixture.  Mea-
surements of the electric field using 1D femtosecond E-FISH technique 
and gas density with laser Rayleigh scattering technique accompanied 
by  CMOS/ICCD  imaging  allowed  detailed  analysis  of  transition  from 
uniform  to  filamentary  form  of  the  discharge  with  an  increase  in  the 
number  of  pulses.  Comparing  the  results  for  CH4/Ar = 6.6/93.4  and 
O2/Ar = 13.4/86.6  mixtures,  it  was  proven  that  heat  release  in 
plasma-assisted low temperature fuel oxidation and pyrolysis provoke 
thermal-chemical instability. 

Similar  to  air,  gas  heating  by  the  discharge  in  hydrocarbon- 
containing  mixtures  can  be  divided  into  the  fast  stage  explained  by 
relaxation of electronically excited species in collisions with molecules 
or  atoms,  and  relatively  slow  stage  due  to  VV’-exchange  and  the 
following VT-relaxation. It should be noted that for a peculiar case of 
CxHy/O2 mixtures, VT-relaxation of vibrationally excited oxygen mole-
cules in reaction with hydrocarbons is fast and provides significant heat

tional relaxation of O2(ν) in reaction with C2H4 molecules was measured 
(cid:0) 7 atm⋅s for 
in [155] for T = 430–1350 K. It was shown that Pτv = 1.2⋅10

VT-relaxation is equal to

and  typical  time  of  VT-relaxation  of  O2(ν)  in  stoichiometric  C2H4/O2 
mixture is equal to 

τVT ≈ 0.5 μs⋅(1atm / P).

So,  in  stoichiometric  CxHy/O2  mixtures  at  pressures  higher  than 
1  bar,  VT-relaxation  at  the  times  shorter  than  gas-dynamic  time  can 
influence formation and propagation of the combustion waves. 

Will also note an important role of reactions of excited atoms O(1D) 
with fuel molecules [156]: it was shown in [30] that these reactions can 
be  the  main  pathway  of  CxHy  dissociation  in  hydrocarbon-air 
non-equilibrium  plasma.  In  stoichiometric  CxHy/air  mixtures,  the  fre-
quencies of reactions O(1D) with CxHy molecules can be comparable to 
the  frequencies  of  quenching  O(1D)  by  N2  and  O2  molecules  [30]; 
therefore, these reactions should be taken into account in the mechanist 
of fast gas heating. 

The  studies  of  fast  gas  heating  in  hydrocarbon/air  mixtures  are 
rather  complicated,  since  heating  due  to  quenching  of  electronically 
excited states of atoms and molecules is accompanied by intense heat 
release in oxidation reactions of hydrocarbon molecules, in particular, in 
reactions with atomic species actively generated in non-equilibrium gas- 
discharge plasma. It is very difficult to experimentally separate the stage 
of  fast  gas  heating  and  the  initial  stage  of  the  combustible  mixture 
oxidation. Several papers combining the study of discharge parameters 
and fast gas heating calculations and measurements in hydrocarbon-air 
mixtures are discussed below. 

Fast gas heating in acetylene-containing mixtures was theoretically 
studied in [77]. The authors performed kinetic calculations for C2H2 /air 
mixture based on the kinetic scheme developed earlier to describe fast 
gas heating in C2H2/O2/Ar mixtures under shock-tube conditions [131]. 
They compared the fractional electron power spent on gas heating in a 
stoichiometric C2H2 /air mixture and in air at T0 = 300 K and P = 1 atm 
versus reduced electric field E/N at which the energy was deposited. 

According to the calculations (Figure 30), at reduced electric fields in

range E/N = 100–400 Td, fractional power spent on fast gas heating is 
practically  the  same  for  air  and  C2H2/air  mixture.  At  higher  fields, 
fractional  power  in  acetylene-air  mixture  becomes  lower  than  in  air.

In the following reaction of electron-ion recombination e + C2H2

noticeable part of the energy is spent to dissociation of C2H2 molecules 
[157] which reduces the fast gas heating efficiency at E/N > 400 Td (see 
Figure 30). 

Experimental  work  [158]  compared  the  temporal  behavior  of  gas 
temperature  and  of  vibrational  temperature  of  nitrogen  molecules 
Tv(N2) in a pulsed nanosecond discharge and in the afterglow in air and 
lean  nonflammable  C3H8/air  (ER = 0.4)  mixtures  at  P0 = 1  atm, 
T0 = 300 K. Experimental data in Figure 31 are obtained at the center of 
the discharge gap, 3.25 mm from the high voltage electrode. Calcula-
tions is air (solid curve) are in good agreement with the experimental 
results.  Even  during  the  discharge,  gas  temperature  increases  to 
800-900  K  being  just  slightly  (100  K)  higher  in  propane-containing 
mixture  than  in  the  air.  Thus,  the  effect  of  small  (1.5%)  additions  of 
C3H8 does not noticeably influence the dynamics of fast gas heating. The 
only  observed  difference,  about  200  K  within  t = 300–700  ns  can  be 
related to heat release in C3H8 oxidation reactions. Temperature rise at 
t > 5 μs is due to VT-relaxation of molecular nitrogen N2(v) in reaction 
(cid:0) 3, 
with atomic oxygen (O-atoms density reaching [O(3P)] ≈ 2⋅1018 cm
see the calculation results in Figure 10b of this review). 

No  agreement  between  gas  temperatures  in  air  and  methane- 
containing  mixture  is  reported  in  [159,160].  Gas  temperature  and 
N2  were measured under identical conditions 
vibrational temperature Tv

perature  using  N2  CARS  thermometry.  High-voltage  pulse  of  19  kV 
amplitude, 70 ns FWHM and 100 Hz repetitive frequency was used in the 
experiments.  The  data  were  compared  for  air  and  premixed  CH4/air 
flows. The mixture equivalence ratio varied within the range ER = 0–2. 
Summary of the data obtained by CARS technique is shown in Figure 32. 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience91(2022)10092821N.A. Popov and S.M. Starikovskaia                                                                                                                                                                                                         

Numerical 0D simulations were performed using CHEMKIN-based code 
involving GRI Mech 3.0 mechanism with artificial addition of radicals at 
the  initial  stage  [160].  The  authors  of  [160]  claim  that  the  energy 
transfer induced by collisions between N2 and CH4 results in significant, 
up  to  2500  K,  gas  heating  at  the  very  early  stage  of  ignition  (about 
100 ns). Unfortunately, no detailed information about kinetic calcula-
tions is given in the paper, so no analysis can be done. 

If the discharge energy, taking into account relaxation of vibration-
ally excited N2(v) is completely thermalized, then the resulting increase 
in gas temperature in air will be ΔT = 640 K. Measurements in the CH4/ 
air mixture result in significantly higher heating values ΔT ≈ 2100 K, 
therefore, the main temperature rise in this mixture is associated with 
heat  release  in  methane  oxidation  reactions.  The  temperature  of 
completely burnt CH4/air mixture at ER = 0.65 is 1790 K [161], taking 
into account gas heating in the discharge (ΔT = 640 K), the final tem-
perature will be 2430 K, which is consistent with the measurement data 
(see Figure 32). Thus, the difference between gas temperature in air and 
ER = 0.65  methane/air  mixture  observed  in  the  experiments  [160]  is 
explained by the active heat release due to the CH4  combustion chem-
istry.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  reactions  chain  prolongation  are 
intensified by additional oxygen atoms generated in the discharge and 
by a rise in gas temperature as a result of the described fast gas heating 
mechanism. 

The main experimental data on fast gas heating in air, nitrogen, H2/ 
air  and  CxHy/air  mixtures, are  presented  in the  Table  4  added  to the 
Appendix 2. For each experiment gas pressure, duration of the discharge 
pulse,  E/N  range,  gas  mixture  composition,  specific  delivered  energy 
and part of energy spent for the fast gas heating are given. 

Conclusions 

The  subject  of  this  review  is  fast  gas  heating  (FGH)  —  an  abrupt 
increase in gas temperature in non-equilibrium low-temperature plasma 
due to relaxation of electronically excited states of atoms and molecules. 
In  the  active  flow  control,  fast  gas  heating  is  responsible  for  thermal 
frequency  perturbations  in  the  range  of  unstable  frequencies  of  flow 
instabilities. These perturbations, being amplified by the flow, control a 
point of laminar-to-turbulent transition, a process of mixing, noise level 
etc.  High  velocity  flows,  up  to  M = 0.85,  can  be  controlled  with  low 
power consumption. In plasma-assisted combustion, abrupt temperature 
increase  due  to  FGH,  together  with  generation  of  radicals  in  plasma, 
induces acceleration of combustion chemistry providing shortening of 
the induction delay time and intensification of combustion. 

A majority of available experiments on fast gas heating is made in 
non-combustible mixtures, typically in air or nitrogen-oxygen mixtures. 
A  detailed  overview  of  FGH  in  these  mixtures  allows  analysis  of  gas 
heating in lean and stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, and scarce experi-
ments  in  hydrogen-containing  and  hydrocarbon-containing  mixtures 
provide experimental verification of the suggested kinetic models. 

Fast gas heating was studied at different conditions and for different 
discharges.  To  generalize  the  results  of  empirical  research  within  the 
frameworks of one model as much  as possible, a universal parameter 
describing  FGH  has  been  suggested.  This  parameter  is  the  fraction  of 
energy spent on fast gas heating ηR. This paper considers the dependence 
of  ηR  on  reduced  electric  field,  gas  pressure,  oxygen  fraction  in  the 
mixture and other parameters. 

Early  papers  of  1980–1990  provided  mainly  experimentally 
measured  dynamics  of  gas  heating,  without  self-consistent  study  of 
reduced electric field and specific deposited energy, - so no parametric 
analysis of the part of energy spent on FGH was possible. This analysis 
has been made on the basis of the later papers of 2010–2021. 

Depending on the value of E/N, the distribution of the discharge en-
ergy  over  the  degrees  of  freedom  changes  significantly.  In  air,  the 
available data were analyzed for three different intervals of the reduced 
electric  field:  (a)  low  fields  E/N  < 100–150  Td,  (b)  moderate  fields 
E/N = 150–400  Td,  when  most  of  the  discharge  energy  goes  to 

dissociation of oxygen molecules and to electronic excitation of atoms 
and molecules, and (c) high fields E/N > 400 Td, when a significant part 
of the discharge energy is spent on dissociation of nitrogen molecules and 
ionization. 

The  suggested  theoretical  models  of  fast  gas  heating  in  nitrogen- 
oxygen gas-discharge plasma are based on quenching of electronically 
excited states of nitrogen molecules by O2  and quenching of excited O 
(1D) atoms by N2, and, at high specific deposited energy, quenching of 
electronically  excited  species  by  O  atoms.  At  high  E/N,  heat  release 
during  dissociation  of  N2  by  electron  impact  and  reactions  involving 
charged  particles  (namely,  ion-molecular  reactions  and  reactions  of 
electron-ion and ion-ion recombination) becomes important. It should 
be noted that in the range of electric fields E/N = 150–300 Td, a sig-
nificant part of discharge energy (50–65%) goes to the dissociation of 
molecular oxygen. As a result, a part of energy spent on FHG is limited 
for the considered interval of electric fields: ηR < 50%. 

Non-numerous experimental papers and dedicated modelling in fuel- 
containing  mixtures  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  fast  gas  heating  can 
substantially influence the earliest, sub-microsecond, stage of combus-
tion chemistry, changing the initial conditions for combustion. In gas- 
discharge  hydrogen-air  plasmas,  an  important  role  is  played  by  re-
actions of dissociation of hydrogen molecules by electron impact and 
reactions  of  quenching  of  electronically  excited  states  O(1D)  and 
N2(C3Πu)  by  hydrogen.  In  hydrocarbon-air  mixtures,  the  role  of  re-
actions  with  hydrocarbons,  in  particular  reactions  of  quenching  of 
electronically excited atoms and molecules by CxHy, decreases with a 
decrease in hydrocarbons fraction in the mixture. We suggest, basing on 
the analysis provided in this paper, that the efficiency of fast gas heating 
in air can be considered as an estimate for FGH in stoichiometric air- 
based mixtures with heavy hydrocarbons. 

With regard to prospective studies, the following should be noted. 
Direct experiments on fast gas heating in combustible mixtures require, 
at sub-microsecond scale, separation of heating caused by relaxation of 
discharge energy, namely FGH, and heat release in combustion chem-
istry. This is a challenging task complicated mainly by modification of 
combustion  chemistry  in  the  presence  of  radicals  and  electronically 
excited species generated in plasma. Direct approach demands, first of 
all, the experimental analysis of spatial uniformity of generated plasma 
and  spatial-temporal  distribution  of  the  deposited  energy;  measure-
ments  should  be  made  with  a  nanosecond  time  resolution.  Measure-
ments of  the  electric  field and  electron  density distribution,  although 
challenging, would provide extremely important information about the 
resulting discharge and post-discharge kinetics. Measurements of den-
sities of the main active species (electronically excited atoms/molecules 
and radicals) throughout the discharge region and measurements of gas 
temperature should be made simultaneously. Measurements of the ki-
netic  curves  of  main  combustion  intermediates  and  gas  temperature, 
now on the scale of combustion chemistry, should complete the exper-
imental picture. Finally, numerical modeling should provide validation 
of FGH mechanism, including combustion chemistry and fast gas heat-
ing in reactions of quenching of excited species. Special attention should 
be given to study of the fast gas heating at elevated pressures, where 
extra-high time and space resolutions will be needed.

In [162], fast gas heating was studied in a pulsed glow discharge. The discharge was initiated in pure nitrogen at pressure P = 1.5 Torr by high 
voltage pulses 120–130 μs in duration. The discharge tube diameter was 12 mm. Measurements were made for currents I = 0.5, 1, and 2 A. The electric 
field measured with probes changed in time and was E = 18–25 V/cm at t > 40 μs for electrical currents I = 1 and 2 A [162]. Gas temperature was 
calculated from the measured rotational structure of 1

bands of the nitrogen system (N2(В3Пg) → N2(A3Σ+

u ) transition).

Calculations with one-dimensional axisymmetric model similar to [163] taking into account gas-dynamic processes have shown that the discharge 
parameters are highly inhomogeneous along the tube radius. Figure 33 shows the calculated profiles of gas temperature at different time points. With 
time, the discharge concentrates in the near-axis region, where gas is more rarefied. At t > 80-90 μs, gas temperature near the axis differs significantly 
from the average over the volume. The calculated electric field in the discharge is consistent with the measurements [162], the E/N value in the near 
axis region is about 60-80 Td. 

Figure 34 compares the results of measurements (symbols) and calculations at the axis of the discharge obtained using two different approaches.

N2(В3Пg, v=1...3) are mainly populated in reaction (B1) resulted in the energy transferring to fast gas heating equal to εR ≈ 4 eV [37,64]. 

It is clearly seen that heat release in reaction (B1) is not enough to explain experimental data [162]. The blue curve represents calculation results of 
temperature  increase  assuming  that  10%  of  the  discharge  energy  is  transformed  to  gas  heating,  ηR = 10%.  Under  considered  conditions,  at 
E/N = 60–80 Td, the major part of discharge energy goes to vibrational excitation of nitrogen molecules by electron impact [26]. In order to obtain 
heating efficiency ηR = 10%, it should be assumed that the significant part of heat release comes from VT-exchange (for example, in the reactions 
between N2(A3Σ+

u ) and vibrationally excited nitrogen molecules). 

Similar value of the energy fraction transformed to gas heating, ηR = (11 ± 1)%, was reported in experiments and calculations [37]. The object of 
◦
the study was a gas discharge in nitrogen in the intersecting (θ = 60
) microwave beams at moderate pressure P = 10–40 Torr. Microwave radiation 
wavelength was λ = 0.8 cm, and pulse duration was τ ≤ 50 μs. The thickness of the plasma sheet, Δ ≈ 0.5 cm, was much smaller than longitudinal and 
transverse dimensions of plasma. Gas temperature in the discharge was determined by two independent techniques: from relative intensity of the 
rotational lines of N2(C3Пu,v=0) → N2(В3Пg,v=2) transition, and from relative population in the rotational levels of the ground electronic state of NH2 
radicals formed during ammonia dissociation used as a diagnostic additive. These data are shown in Figure 35 by points (1) and (2), respectively.

Calculations of the gas heating dynamics in [37], showed that the main energy release in the discharge occurs in the reduced electric field E/N ≈ 80 Td, 
the energy deposition reaches W ≈ 0.4 eV/molecule. The best agreement with measured data in terms of the absolute value and the temporal behavior 
of gas temperature is achieved when the fraction of energy transferred to gas heating is ηR = (11 ± 1)%, see Figure 35. 

Another moderate pressure (P = 100 Torr) discharge in nitrogen with a possible fraction of oxygen 0.01% was studied in [38]. The discharge 
generated spatially uniform plasma in 1.3 cm gap using capacitance C = 10 nF charged to 23 kV and then discharged through a thyratron. The current 
pulse duration was about 1 μs. To visualize gas-dynamic perturbations after the pulsed discharge, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer was used. The value 
of the thermalized energy fraction ηR = 11% was determined from the analysis of interferograms. It should be noted that shock waves that formed in 
the cathode and anode regions, complicate the data processing and so, the value ηR = 11% may turn out to be greatly overestimated. 

Similar  measurements  in  a  wide  range  of  specific  deposited  energies  were  made  in  pure  nitrogen  at  Р = 75  Torr  [40].  The  duration  of  the 
self-sustained discharge with pre-ionization was 0.5 microseconds, the specific delivered energy was in the range of 0.04–0.3 eV/mol at voltage 
changing from 12 to 36 kV (C = 8 nF). Holographic interferometry was used to study the dynamics of gas expansion [40]. The fraction of energy 
transformed to gas heating, ηR increased from 5.6% at 0.1 eV/mol to 9.8% at 0.3 eV/mol. 

Figure 36 summarizes the above experimentally obtained fractions of energy ηR spent on fast gas heating as a function of the delivered energy W. It 
is seen that at W ≥ 0.25 eV/mol, the fraction is almost constant: ηR = 10–11%. It should be noted that the majority of data in Figure 36 is taken at 
almost the same value of the reduced electric field: E/N = 70–80 Td. We believe that this is the main reason of the constant value of ηR, in spite of a

was emphasized. The time-dependent evolution of energy transfer to gas heating in a pure N2 discharge at low pressures P = 1–10 Torr was studied for 
different values of the reduced electric field and discharge power. The results of the rates of gas heating at P = 10 Torr and fixed reduced electric field 
(cid:0) 3) are given in Figure 37. Pooling reactions (B1) and (B2) are responsible for a smooth increase in 
(E/N = 100 Td) and electron density (Ne = 1011 cm
gas temperature before the first millisecond. For longer times, gas heating is caused by vibrational energy exchange from non-resonant V-V processes 
between N2 molecules and by vibration-translation (V-T) N2–N collisions. The fraction of energy transformed to gas heating via excitation of electronic 
levels was found to be ~ 2% while the fraction of energy transformed via vibrational excitation was in the range of 10–35% [166]. 

Important  role  of  pooling  reactions  was  demonstrated  in  [167]. In  the  same  paper,  it  was  shown  that  at  high  E/N,  when  dissociation  of  N2

molecules is significant, the reaction of quenching of excited N(2D) atoms provides noticeable input in fast gas heating. In [167], the discharge was 
initiated in nitrogen at P = 100 Torr by 10 kV high voltage pulse of 100 ns between two sphere-shape electrodes spaced 1 cm apart. Time-resolved 
temperature  and  N2(v)  vibrational  population  was  measured  by  picoseconds  broadband  coherent  anti-Stokes  Raman  spectroscopy  (CARS).  Gas 
temperature was equal to about 500 K at 5 μs. Comparison of the experimental results with the results of 1D numerical modeling (Figure 38) has 
shown that the main channels of heat release are the reaction of self-quenching of N2(A3Σ+
u ) molecules ((R1, R2, R16) in Figure 38) and the reac-
tion of quenching of excited N(2D) atoms (R9). The first channel is dominant at t < 1 μs, while the second one prevails at t > 2 μs. It was assumed [167] 
that only 20% of nitrogen atoms generated in the discharge are in N(2D) state. However, the data on molecular nitrogen dissociation obtained in [112] 
show that pre-dissociation to N(2D) + N(4S) fragments is the primary mechanism of N2 dissociation by electron impact. Thus, the fraction of nitrogen 
atoms generated in the discharge in N(2D) state obtained in [167] can be underestimated. In particular, this can be a reason of observed difference 
between experimental data and numerical modeling at t = 2–10 μs. 

Since reactions involving oxygen molecules play an important role in the mechanism of fast heating, we should expect a change in gas heating rate 
with a change in the δ - fraction of oxygen in the mixture. Figure 39 shows experimental data [42] and calculation results [64] for the dependence of 
gas heating rate on oxygen fraction in the N2/O2 mixture at P = 0.4 Torr and the average current density j = 0.8 A/cm2. At low pressures, the main 
channels for fast heating in air are quenching reactions of N2(B3Пg), N2(a
u ) molecules by oxygen, dissociation of O2  by electron impact and 
quenching of O(1D) atoms by molecular nitrogen. The contributions of these processes are proportional to the O2 concentration and, consequently, 
decrease with a decrease in oxygen fraction in the mixture. 

′1Σ(cid:0)

Heating rate as a function on oxygen fraction in the mixture for the conditions [42] was calculated in [64]. Solid and dashed curves in Figure 39 
correspond to taking or not into account reaction (B1). The solid curve describes experimental data on heating rate of N2/O2 mixtures in the entire 
studied range δ = 0–20%. So, reaction (B1) is one of the main channels of fast gas heating in pure nitrogen and nitrogen with small oxygen additions 
[42,64]. 

New processes responsible for fast gas heating emerge when the specific deposited energy and the reduced electric field are high, and so, the degree 
of electronic excitation and dissociation is high. Fast gas heating was studied experimentally and numerically under the conditions of high specific 
energy deposition (≈ 0.8 eV/molecule), and high reduced electric fields (E/N = 150–300 Td) in a nanosecond discharge in nitrogen at P = 20 Torr 
[78]. The discharge was initiated in a quartz capillary tube with an internal diameter of 1.5 mm and an inter-electrode distance of 75 mm. Three 
subsequent pulses about 30 ns FWHM at intervals of 250 ns were delivered to the high voltage electrode. Gas temperature was measured on the basis of 
distribution of emission in rotational lines of molecular nitrogen N2(C3Пg,v) → N2(В3Пg,v’) transition. A high temperature rise over the timescale of 
hundreds of nanoseconds was observed experimentally: gas temperature reached 2000 K during 600 ns after the first pulse at an initial temperature 
equal to 300 K (see Figure 40). A similar increase in gas temperature was observed in N2/O2 mixtures with 1, 10 and 20% of O2 admixture. 

Based on a comparison of experimental results with the results of numerical calculations, the mechanism of fast gas heating in pure nitrogen at high 

specific delivered energy was suggested. 

A pooling reaction between N2(B) molecules was suggested as a new process leading to heat release:

are important in kinetics of nanosecond capillary discharge under the conditions of [78]. Rate constant of reaction (B5) increases with temperature, 
and up to 90% of the released energy goes to fast gas heating [78]. 

Reactions (B4), (B5) change the branching ratio for fast gas heating: the role of reaction (B3) decreases and the role of (B5) increases. Nevertheless, 

in total, reactions (B3)–(B5) provide fast gas heating close to curve 1 in Figure 40 and are in a good correlation with measurements [78]. 

Thus, fast gas heating in molecular nitrogen at high reduced electric fields and high specific delivered energies is due to heat release in pooling

Nikolay  Popov  received  the  Ph.D.  in  Plasma  Physics  from 
Moscow Radio-Technical Institute Russia Academy of Science, 
Moscow,  in  1990  and  Dr.Sc.  degree  from  Moscow  State 
University,  in  2010.  He  is  currently  a  Leading  Scientific 
Researcher in Skobel’tsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics, Moscow 
State  University.  His  research  is  focused  on  modeling  of 
physical and chemical processes in plasma of DC discharges, 
microwave discharges and pulsed nanosecond discharges. He 
developed plasma-chemical models describing the ignition of 
combustible  mixtures  activated  by  pulsed  high-current  dis-
charges. His other areas of interest include influence of chem-
ically active particles generated in the discharge and fast gas 
heating on the induction delay times and decrease in the igni-
tion threshold of combustible mixtures. His research is also focused on the contraction of 
the discharge channel in high pressure gases (1-10 atm) during the nanosecond time scale. 
The proposed mechanism of contraction is based on the field emission instability of the 
cathode layer; in addition, the processes of stepwise ionization and dissociation of elec-
tronically excited molecules by electron impact play an important role. He is co-director of 
the  International  Associated  Laboratory  LIA  KaPPA  “Kinetics  and  Physics  of  Pulsed 
Discharge Plasma and Their Afterglow”, which unites the Russian groups of the JIHT RAS 
and the Moscow State University, as well as French groups from the plasma physics lab-
oratories  LPP  Ecole  Polytechnique  (Paris)  and  LAPLACE,  Universit´e  de  Toulouse 
(Toulouse).  

Svetlana  Starikovskaia  received  the  Ph.D.  in  Plasma  Physics 
from  Moscow  Institute  of  Physics  and  Technology  (MIPT)  in 
1993, Dr.Sc. degree from Joint Institute of High Temperatures 
Russian Academy of Sciences in 2000 and degree of Professor 
from MIPT in 2006. She is currently a CNRS Leading Scientific 
Researcher (DR) in Laboratory of Plasma Physics (LPP) at Ecole 
Polytechnique,  Palaiseau,  France.  Her  scientific  interests 
involve  molecular  energy  transfer  studies,  non-equilibrium 
plasma  research,  plasma-assisted  combustion,  plasma-living 
cells interaction, shock waves and chemical kinetics research, 
plasma conversion of CO2. She was between the pioneers in the 
field  of  plasma-assisted  ignition  and  combustion  (PAI/PAC) 
and  the  author  of  the  first  review  dedicated  to  PAI/PAC  in 
2006. On-going investigations involve the use of pulsed nanosecond discharges for plasma- 
assisted ignition of fuels at high pressure, plasma-assisted detonation; research related to 
development of pulsed discharges in a wide range of pressures (20 mbar-15 bar), wide 
range  of  specific  deposited  energy  (0.001–10  eV/molecule);  development  of  advanced 
laser diagnostics in short pulsed discharges. She is a director of the French-Russian In-
ternational Associated Laboratory LIA KaPPA “Kinetics and Physics of Pulsed Discharge 
Plasma and Their Afterglow”.
