    "question_text": "Analyze how aerosol radiative transfer impacts hybrid model performance in arid climates (B) using the radiative transfer equation.",
    "standard_answer": "The radiative transfer equation for diffuse irradiance G_d in arid climates contains significant aerosol terms: μdG_d/dτ = G_d - ω₀∫P(μ,μ')G_d(μ')dμ' - (ω₀/4π)P(μ,-μ₀)G_n exp(-τ/μ₀) where τ is aerosol optical depth, ω₀ single-scattering albedo, and P phase function. Arid regions typically have τ~0.3-0.5 from dust, with strongly forward-scattering phase functions (asymmetry parameter g~0.7). Hybrid models outperform pure NWP here because: 1) Data assimilation corrects τ biases through AOD-ground measurements closure 2) Machine learning approximates the nonlinear P(μ,μ') integrals 3) The paper notes 'HY models combine best that other classes have to offer'. This explains why arid climates show 2.1% mean nMBE (low bias) versus 1.7% in temperate climates, as aerosol scattering is better resolved.",

      "1": "The accuracy of the forecasting models significantly increased in the last decade.",
      "2": "Generally, the hybrid models have the best performance."
