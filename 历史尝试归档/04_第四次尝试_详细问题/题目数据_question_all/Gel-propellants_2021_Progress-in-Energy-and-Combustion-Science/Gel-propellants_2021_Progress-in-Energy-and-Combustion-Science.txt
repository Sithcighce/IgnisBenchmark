The transformation of a liquid propellant into a semi-solid gel state paves way for energetically improved, 
reliable, safer, and possibly green futuristic propellant for rocket and ramjet propulsion. A review of the 
progress achieved on gel propellants so far is essential to expand the capabilities of gel propellants by 
adopting new avenues for research and development towards actual space ﬂights. In keeping with this 
objective, we comprehensively present various aspects of gel propellants in this review. Physically, gel 
propellants are the ﬂuids whose rheological properties are altered by gelling agents so that they behave 
as solids at rest and can be atomized and combusted like conventional liquid propellants. The current 
deﬁnition of the gel propellants emphasizes their ability to ﬂow under shear and gel propellants are al- 
most exclusively intended to function like liquid propellants. Gel propellants have a considerable history; 
and research and development is continuously expanding across the world. Different research groups 
are working on the relevant areas of this ﬁeld and research has gathered momentum in the ﬁrst two 
decades of the present century. Hundreds of studies on all the aspects of gel propulsion including formu- 
lation, rheological behavior, atomization, combustion, and applications, have appeared. Gel propellants 
have been applied in rocket motors, ramjets, furnace combustion, and afterburners of jet engines. On this 
background, compilation and organization of the accumulated knowledge in this ﬁeld, identiﬁcation of 
relevant issues, unraveling of the links among the different areas of study, and identiﬁcation of the open 
gaps for future study have become essential and these are the chief objectives in organizing the present 
review. This review encompasses the formulation, ﬂow characterization, atomization, and combustion of 
gel propellants. We begin with a perspective on gel propellants and discuss the relevant aspects of con- 
ventional liquid propellants and previous effort s to improve their energetic performance. Inherent advan- 
tages of gel propellants and the challenges faced in their realization are considered. Formulation of gel 
propellants and their simulants is covered with emphasis on the description of different types of gelling 
agents and methods of their incorporation into the liquid propellants. Our emphasis is on the connec- 
tion between formulation parameters and ﬂow properties of gels. Of special signiﬁcance are the recent 
attempts at formulating hypergolic gel propellants other than the hydrazine class. Flow properties of gels 
are of critical importance in tailoring their behaviors. Therefore, non-Newtonian ﬂow properties of the 
gel propellants are discussed. Gels are ’complex ﬂuids’ and a number of rheological functions and mea- 
surement methods are necessary for comprehensively characterizing the complexity. Hence, we describe 
the rheological properties of many gel propellants and focus on their interpretation. Rheological matching 
of gels to develop gel propellant simulants is considered. Simulants provide a useful strategy to conduct 
ﬂow and atomization experiments for hazardous or expensive propellants. Atomization of gel propellants 
is discussed with the aid of results in which various aspects of atomization of gel propellants using con- 
ventional and specially designed atomizers have been addressed. We also discuss the role of rheological 
properties in determining the behavior of gel fragments, ligaments, and droplets. A large amount of quan- 
titative data on the spray properties are compiled and discussed in this review. Theoretical analyses of gel 
propellant breakup are reviewed. Discussion on combustion is divided into droplet combustion and spray 
combustion. In droplet combustion, we include the studies on hypergolic and non-hypergolic gel pro- 
pellants and consider the processes during heating, vaporization, and combustion of tethered and freely

falling droplets of gel propellants. Attempts at theoretical analysis of these processes are considered. In 
case of hypergolic gels, current understanding of their ignition is reviewed using modeling studies. Spray 
combustion of gel propellants is considered with reference to the modeling studies on canonical spray 
diffusion and premixed ﬂames and experimental observations corroborating their ﬁndings are discussed. 
A majority of spray combustion studies reported to date have been carried out on small-scale rocket mo- 
tors. These studies are reviewed here and the reported performance parameters are compiled. In each 
of the sections, we also review the status of metalized gel propellants with consideration to choice of 
metals and experience with metal slurries. A roadmap for future progress is proposed and recommen- 
dations are made based on the discussion in the preceding sections. We have given particular attention 
to the linkages among the four areas of gel propellant combustion. Selected data have been extensively 
tabulated for many of the speciﬁc topics considered in this review and it is supplemented by a separate 
comprehensive table.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Background and overview 

Gelled  fuels,  oxidizers,  and  monopropellants  are  the  ﬂuids 
whose rheological properties are altered by gelling agents (or gel- 
lants) so that they behave as solids at rest and can be atomized 
and combusted like conventional liquid fuels when ﬂowing under 
shear. Across the world, research and development on multiple as- 
pects of gel propellants is continuously expanding. Following para- 
graphs present an overview of these effort s. Topical review of spe- 
ciﬁc themes in this ﬁeld is covered in the subsequent sections. 

Gel propellants (both fuels and oxidizers, as well as monopro- 
pellants)  have  a  considerable  history  of  development  and  some 
early studies are important from a historic perspective. Different 
gel  fuels  were  patented  beginning  late  1930s  [1-6] .  One  patent 
[1] was about "..the production of a novel, solidiﬁed fuel in which a 
liquid, combustible component is maintained as a ﬁrm, stable, ho- 
mogeneous gel by a supporting framework of a colloidal, inorganic 
substance such as colloidal silicic acid, silica, titanic acid, and the 
like" while another [2] was concerned with "..their use in a man- 
ner analogous to solid propellants". In fact, Russian GIRD program 
used colophonium to gel gasoline. The gel fuel was then suspended 
on a wire mesh and combusted with liquid oxygen in a test ﬂight 
of 500 N thrust in 1933 [7] . Tarpley [ 4 , 5 ] disclosed a thixotropic 
oxidizer "..having the property of being unpourable under storage 
or  low  shear  conditions  and  of  becoming  ﬂuid  and  ﬂowing  un- 
der increased shear." Another patent by Tarpley [6] considered a 
thixotropic gel fuel for oil burners in which a carboniferous solid 
was used. 

McKinney and Tarpley [8] pursued gelation of liquid hydrogen 
in an early study. Ultraﬁne particles of lithium and lithium boro- 
hydride were added in liquid hydrogen (LH 
2 ) at 61.1 w/o and 58.5 
w/o, respectively by direct mixing of solid particles or in situ con- 
densation. Gelled hydrogen was prepared, mainly to improve the 
storability by reducing the rate of vaporization. These studies also 
investigated  the  scale-up  issues,  along  with  handling  steps  like 
heating and stability, pumping, rheological behavior, and cold ﬂow 
characteristics. Rapial and Daney [9] combined the advantages of 

slush hydrogen (a mixture of liquid and solid hydrogen) and hy- 
drogen gel into slush hydrogen gel using silica (Cab-O-Sil®) of 7 
nm size as gellant. Gelation of oxygen diﬂuoride oxidizer using the 
micrometric particles of solid chlorine triﬂuoride (ClF 
3 ) mixed in 
5.5 % was attempted as part of a program for the development of 
space-storable gel propellants [10] . The gellant was unique in that 
it would vaporize at ambient temperatures [10] . The resulting gels 
were  storable  for  30  days  and  were  characterized  as  "extremely 
shear thinning". The term ’shear thinning’ denotes decrease in the 
viscosity of a gel as shear rates are increased. It is one of the many 
characteristic properties of a rheologically complex ﬂuid such as a 
gel. Gelation of the cryogenic ﬂuids has been less studied in recent 
times and studies summarized in Refs. [8-10] are some of the most 
comprehensive early reports available on this topic. Table 1 sum- 
marizes the important information contained in the early patent 
literature on gel propulsion. 

The current deﬁnition of gel propellants emphasizes their abil- 
ity to ﬂow under shear. Thus, the gel propellants are almost ex- 
clusively intended to function like liquid propellants. On the other 
hand, Table 1 shows that the earliest use of gel propellants was 
for permanent immobilization of liquid fuel or oxidizer, even dur- 
ing combustion [1-3] because they were intended to be used as 
solid propellants. Eventually, they came to be employed for con- 
ventional liquid fuels and oxidizers [4-6] , and thence to gelling the 
cryogenic LH 
2 [8-10] . They continue to be considered for applica- 
tions as solid propellants in exo-atmospheric missions and divert 
and attitude control systems (see for example, Ref. [11] ). 

Rheological behavior was recognized as the mainstay of their 
use  either  as  a  solid  or  liquid-like  propellant,  leading  to  the 
concept  of  a  tailor-made  yield  stress  [ 4 , 6 ],  a  critical  stress  be- 
low  which  the  material  behaves  like  an  ideal  solid  and  above 
which  it  ﬂows  like  a  liquid.  Thixotropy,  a  general  term  that  en- 
compasses the time-dependent rheological behavior of some non- 
Newtonian ﬂuids, was also recognized [ 4 , 6 ]. Perhaps, the ﬁrst men- 
tion  of  desired  properties  of  gellants  in  the  context  of  propul- 
sion  is  also  found  in  one  of  these  studies  [5] .  Another  ﬁrst 
achieved  in  these  studies  is  the  recognition  of  gellants  that  are 
combustible  in  their  own  right,  for  example,  carbon  black  [ 4 , 6 ]

In  mid-1980s,  Varma  and  coworkers  [12-14]  investigated  the 
gelation  and  rheological  features  of  hypergolic  unsymmetrical 
dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) and red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) by 
methylcellulose and sodium silicate, respectively. They also found 
that the scale-up of process increased the gelation time for UDMH 
[12] . 

Research on gel propulsion picked up in the late 1980s at NASA 
[15] and TRW [16] . Gels were characterized as non-Newtonian ﬂu- 
ids and studies on their atomization properties began [15] . Little 
was  known  then  because  the  propulsion  community  lacked  the 
basis necessary to deal with the complex issues of these propel- 
lants. However, gels were already identiﬁed as capable of provid- 
ing answers to safety issues, as well as possessing the performance 
advantages; therefore,  they  received  signiﬁcant  attention  [16] .  In 
March 1999, ﬂight test of a carbon-loaded gelled monomethyl hy- 
drazine (MMH) and gelled inhibited RFNA (IRFNA) was successfully 
conducted by TRW [16] , a very important development that proved 
the concept of gel propulsion. 

In the mid-1990s and 20 0 0s, three sides of the scientiﬁc tri- 
angle for gel propellants: rheology, atomization, and combustion, 
were  deﬁned  in  basic  studies  conducted  at  the  Technion,  Israel 
[17] .  All  these  areas  were  studied  and  provided  a  ﬁrst  good  in- 
sight to the issues involved. The rheological properties of the gel 
ﬂuids  were  proved  to  play  the  most  signiﬁcant  role  in  the  ﬂow 
in pipes and injectors [ 18 , 19 ], in atomization [17] , and in combus- 
tion [20] . Novel injectors were developed to decrease the feeding 
pressure and achieve ﬁne atomization [21] , a problem always to be 
faced during the implementation of any practical gel fuel and oxi- 
dizer. The combustion of gel fuel droplets was studied using inor- 

ganic [22] and organic gellants [ 20 , 23 , 24 ]. The combustion mech- 
anism of gel fuels was investigated experimentally [24] and theo- 
retically [25] , and new phenomena were revealed [ 24 , 25 ]. Develop- 
mental work at Rafael led to the formulation, characterization, and 
laboratory-scale rocket combustion of hydrazine-based gel propel- 
lants [26] . 

Cooperation  between  DLR-Germany  and  Technion-Israel  that 
started  in  20 0 0  opened  the  road  to  further  scientiﬁc  achieve- 
ments. Research at DLR obtained understanding of the atomization 
regimes  (formation  of  sheets,  ligaments,  ’threads’,  and  droplets) 
based on the rheological properties, jet velocity, and generalized 
Reynolds and Weber numbers [27] . Rheological properties of gels 
using  various  gelling  agents  were  also  studied  [28] .  Signiﬁcant 
progress  was  achieved  at  the  Fraunhofer  Institute  for  Chemical

In Israel, the idea of hypergolic ignition of gelled kerosene that 
contains  catalyst/reactive  particles  with  hydrogen  peroxide  (HP, 
2 ) was proposed [ 34 , 35 ]. These propellants are non-toxic and 
H 
hypergolic ignition can be obtained only because the gelation en- 
ables particle suspension. This proposal can be used also in space 
application as a hydrazine alternative. The issue of a metalized gel 
fuel  ramjet  engine  was  investigated  in  Germany  [36]  and  Israel 
[37] . Gelled kerosene allows the suspension of metal particles such

as boron, that can burn eﬃciently inside the motor under certain 
conditions. Theoretical potential of the boron loaded Jet A1 gel fuel 
powered ramjet missile has been shown to greatly exceed that of 
a typical aluminum loaded solid rocket motor [37] with the help 
of bypass air to improve the eﬃciency of energy extraction. Same 
payload could be delivered with boron-loaded gel fuel to a longer 
range and for less total weight. In this case, the use of a gel fuel 
would be in suspending the boron particles. A theoretical assess- 
ment  of  the  performance  of  such  an  engine,  boosted  by  a  solid 
rocket motor, shows that an air-to-surface 1500 kg (total) missile 
can reach a range of 10 0 0 km within 20 minutes, obtaining an av- 
erage theoretical speciﬁc impulse ( I sp ) of ∼2190 s [37] . 

Beginning 2008, multiple universities in the United States en- 
gaged  in  basic  research  on  gels  of  hypergolic  fuels  and  oxidiz- 
ers. In addition to MMH, tetramethylethane diamine (TMEDA) and 
dimethyl  ethanamine  azide  (DMAZ)  were  used  as  hypergolic  fu- 
els in combination with white fuming nitric acid (WFNA), RFNA, 
and nitrogen tetroxide (N 
4 ) oxidizers. Gelation was achieved us- 
ing Cab-O-Sil®. These intensive effort s spurred the analysis of ig- 
nition of hypergolic gel propellants [38] , atomization studies us- 
ing the impinging jets [ 39 , 40 ], characterization of gel propellants 
[41] , and characterization of MMH gel droplet combustion [ 42 , 43 ], 
among others.

In the twenty-ﬁrst century, studies on gel propellants address- 
ing  formulation  [44] ,  atomization  [45-52] ,  ﬂow  characterization 
[51-53] ,  and  combustion  [54-58]  have  been  reported  from  Asia. 
Results presented by Padwal and Mishra addressed the relation- 
ships among formulation [44] , rheological characteristics [53] , and 
atomization [ 49 , 52 ] of Jet A1 gel fuel in which a particulate non- 
polymeric organic gellant Thixatrol ST® was used. Atomization by 
the novel two-ﬂuid internally impinging jets atomizer [ 49 , 52 ] and 
its  use  in  spray  ﬂames  was  demonstrated  for  the  ﬁrst  time  by 

9 

these authors [56] . Mishra et al. [54] undertook studies on droplet 
combustion of gel droplet. He and coworkers [55] modeled the hy- 
pergolic ignition and dynamics of a gel droplet and their model is 
a promising start to the theoretical analysis of hypergolic and non- 
hypergolic droplet combustion involving gels. Lee and Koo [46] at- 
omized water-crosslinked polyacrylic acid (Carbopol®) gels rheo- 
logically matched with metalized RP-1 gels in a conventional like- 
on-like impinging jet injector. Nanoparticles of steel (15 %) were 
suspended in similar gels by Baek and coworkers and detailed at- 
omization [47] and rheological [51] characterization was reported. 
Recent studies [ 57 , 58 ] considered the hypergolicity of ethanol and 
ethanolamine based gels formed by polymeric gellants. 

Overview of the literature on gel fuels and oxidizers given in 
the preceding paragraphs suggests that different research groups 
have been working on the four relevant areas of this ﬁeld, includ- 
ing formulation, rheological characterization and ﬂow behavior, at- 
omization, and combustion. Many specialized areas have emerged 
under these broad categories, which have been listed as shown in 
Fig. 1 . We consider all of the mentioned areas in the subsequent 
sections. 

Natan  and  Rahimi  [59]  reviewed  the  status  of  gel  propulsion 
prior  to  20 0 0s.  Since  then,  the  research  on  gel  propellants  has 
gathered momentum in the ﬁrst two decades of the present cen- 
tury and a signiﬁcant number of studies on all the aspects of gel 
propulsion appeared as seen from Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 shows the distri- 
bution of a sample of 196 studies reviewed here in terms of scat- 
ter plot ( Fig. 2 ) and a bar chart ( Fig. 2 ). We have divided the ﬁeld 
into ﬁve areas for ease of treatment. They include formulation, rhe- 
ological  behavior,  atomization,  combustion,  and  applications.  We 
have endeavored to exhaustively cover the literature on gel pro- 
pellants and  allied areas.  Majority  of  applications studied  in  the 
recent times, and the studies in areas mentioned in Fig. 1 , pertain 
to rocket propulsion, although combustion applications in furnace 
[6] and afterburners [60] were tried many years ago. Combustion 
under the conditions relevant for typical rocket and ramjet appli- 
cations using the gel propellants is discussed in Section 6.9 . 

Synthesis of the accumulated knowledge in this ﬁeld, identiﬁca- 
tion of the relevant issues, unraveling of the links among the dif- 
ferent areas of study, and identiﬁcation of open gaps for further 
study are our chief objectives in organizing the review. These re- 
quirements are fulﬁlled with a comprehensive discussion encom- 
passing  the  formulation,  ﬂow  characterization,  atomization,  and 
combustion of gel fuels and oxidizers. The remaining part of this 
review is organized as below. 

1.2. Organization of review 

Section 2 offers a perspective on gel propellants. We discuss the 
relevant aspects of conventional liquid propellants and previous ef- 
forts to improve their energetic performance. Inherent advantages 
of gel propellants and the challenges faced in their realization are 
considered. 

Section 3 covers the formulation of gel propellants with em- 
phasis on the description of different types of gelling agents and 
methods of their incorporation into the liquid propellants. We also 
discuss the gel propellant simulants in this section. Our empha- 
sis is on the connection between formulation parameters and ﬂow 
properties of gels. Of special signiﬁcance are the recent attempts 
at formulating hypergolic gel propellants other than hydrazines. 

Flow properties of the gels are of critical importance in tailoring 
their  behavior  during  formulation,  atomization,  and  combustion. 
Gels are ’complex ﬂuids’ and a number of rheological functions and 
measurement methods are necessary for comprehensively charac- 
terizing  the  complexity.  Therefore,  Section  4  describes  the  non- 
Newtonian ﬂow properties of gel propellants. We describe the rhe- 
ological properties of gels and focus on their interpretation in con-

sion  and  premixed  ﬂames  in  conjunction  with  the  experimental 
observations corroborating their ﬁndings. A majority of the spray 
combustion studies reported to date are concerned with static ﬁre 
tests on the small-scale rocket motors. These studies are reviewed 
and performance parameters reported so far are compiled. 

We  also  review  the  status  of  metalized  gel  propellants  with 
consideration to the choice of metals and experience with metal 
slurries in each of the above sections. 

Section 7 brieﬂy summarizes the state of the art in gel propel- 
lants. Section 8 presents a roadmap and offers speciﬁc recommen- 
dations on each area of study for future progress in gel propellants. 
Finally, we conclude the review in Section 9 with a few general re- 
marks.

nection to formulation, atomization, and combustion. This section 
also discusses the rheological matching of gels for effectively test- 
ing gel propellant simulants in ﬂow and atomization experiments 
where hazardous or expensive propellants might be involved. 

Section  5  focuses  on  the  atomization  of  gel  propellants  with 
the aid of many studies conducted so far, in which the physical 
mechanisms involved in the atomization of gel propellants by con- 
ventional and specially designed atomizers have been addressed. 
We also discuss the role of rheological properties in determining 
the behavior of gel fragments, ligaments, and droplets. Quantita- 
tive data on the spray properties are summarized and tabulated. 
Theoretical analyses of gel propellant breakup are reviewed. 

Section 6 considers the combustion of gel propellants. It is di- 
vided into two areas, droplet combustion and spray combustion. 
In droplet combustion, we include the studies on hypergolic and 
non-hypergolic gel propellants. We consider the processes during 
heating, vaporization, and combustion of tethered and freely falling 
droplets of gel propellants. Attempts at theoretical analysis of these 
processes are covered in detail. In case of the hypergolic gels, cur- 
rent understanding of their ignition is reviewed using a couple of 
modeling studies. Spray combustion of gel propellants is discussed 
with reference to the modeling studies on canonical spray diffu- 

Liquid  propellant,  as  either  a  mono  or  bipropellant,  is  a 
workhorse of propulsion systems. It is pumped / fed under pres- 
sure and atomization system is used to spray the liquid into the 
combustion chamber. In general, combustion of liquid propellants 
is easier to control than solid propellants. Liquid propellants can 
be in the form of highly reﬁned kerosene (JP series fuels, Jet A1, 
2 ),  or  hypergolic  propel- 
and  RP-1),  cryogenic  propellant  (LH 
lants (various compounds of hydrazine class), etc. Conventional liq- 
uid  propellants  suffer  from  a  number  of  drawbacks  depicted  in 
Fig. 3 . 

2 -LO 

With increase in the payload and costs involved in launching 
rocket vehicles, there is a need for high-performance liquid pro- 
pellants of higher speciﬁc energy density, for example, cryogenic 
propellants. An issue of major importance with all liquid propel- 
lants is sloshing in the storage tanks [61] , long been identiﬁed dur- 
ing the landing of Apollo 11 lunar module [62] . Third major disad- 
vantage of the conventional liquid propellants is the possibility of 
leakage and spills during handling, especially in case of inherently 
hazardous hypergolic liquids. Cryogenic liquid propellants are more 
diﬃcult to handle and suffer from high boil-off losses, embrittle- 
ment, and diﬃculty of storage under zero gravity. Finally, hyper- 
golic propellants are easy to ignite and control, but less energetic

than cryogenic propellants. Gelation of each of the above classes of 
liquid propellants can reduce or nullify these disadvantages. 

2.2. Slurry propellants 

Addition of metal particles in solid propellants is long known 
to enhance the performance of rocket engines. Although, a simi- 
lar beneﬁt can result from addition of metals to liquid propellants, 
several  technological  problems  must  be  addressed  to  achieve  an 
appropriate solution  [60] .  The  idea  of  suspending boron  (B)  and 
magnesium (Mg) powders in JP fuel for enhancing the thrust and 
range of ramjets and turbofan engine afterburners was successfully 
explored at NACA [60] . 

Some of the highly dense (metal particles in excess of 50-60 
%) formulations at NACA used aluminum octoate (Al-O) as gelling 
agent for JP slurries with B [63] and Mg [64] , which qualify as gel 
propellants. In many cases, superﬁne magnesium particles of mass 
median diameter ( D 0.5 ) of 24 μm and obtained from liquid metal 
atomization were used. Representative results of these studies are 
shown in Fig. 4 . 

Fig.  4 a  illustrates  the  particles  obtained  by  atomization 
( D 0.5 = 24 μm). Increase in the concentration of metal particles led 
to nearly exponential rise in the apparent viscosity ( ηapp ) of the 
slurry gel propellant as shown in Fig. 4 b 1 . Figs. 4 b 2 and 4 c indi- 
cate  that  the  stabilized  slurry  fuels  of  shelf  life  in  excess  of  six 
months could be formulated in these studies [ 60 , 65 , 66 ]. A notable 
feature of the slurries is the dependence of ηapp  on the duration 
of storage; the gradual decrease in viscosity is an indicator of the 
deteriorating stability and homogeneity of slurries (gelled or oth- 
erwise) and it is also a sign of the thixotropic rheological behavior. 
However, stability of the gelled slurries markedly improved with 
increase in the concentration of Al-O gellant from 0.2 % ( (cid:2)) to 0.4 
% ( ●), as shown in Fig. 4 b 2 . Similarly, increase in the concentrations 
of metal particles also improved the stability of slurries during the 
long-term  storage  as  seen  from  Fig.  4 c.  Stability  here  is  quanti- 
ﬁed in terms of the settling ratio, deﬁned as the ratio of metal- 
liquid  phase  height  and  total  liquid-slurry  height.  Boron  slurries 
are especially stable in this respect (compare (cid:2) with (cid:3), Fig. 4 c 1 ), 
while Mg slurry showed the maximum improvement when mixed 
with 1.2 % Al-O for 30 % base concentration. Large quantities of 
gel propellants might not be always stored in controlled environ- 

11

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 83 (2021) 100885 

ment. Therefore the effects of variations in the ambient conditions, 
chieﬂy temperature, require some attention when long-term stor- 
age is desired. One example of JP-3-30 wt % Mg slurry propellant 
stabilized by 0.56 wt % Al-O gellant is shown in Fig. 4 c 2 . The rapid 
decrease in the stability with increasing temperature is observed. 
Notably, the range of temperature is typical of normal storage con- 
ditions. 

Fig. 4 d shows two illustrative images of the sprays obtained us- 
ing plain oriﬁce injection of fuels in parallel ﬂow of air of the type 
used in afterburner combustion. The phasic velocities for the im- 
slurry = 8 m/s. At the 
ages shown in Fig. 4 d were u 
same operating conditions, and the same exposure to illuminating 
light, the spray quality of the 30 % Mg slurry gel propellant dete- 
riorated in comparison with JP-3 fuel. The spray was composed of 
large fragments of the gel moving slowly relative to the atomiza- 
tion air. Results of combustion studies using the gelled slurries of 
B and Mg are reviewed subsequently in Sections 6.8 and 6.9 . 

air = 122 m/s, u 

The stability and reproducibility of slurries was cited as a ma- 
jor concern [60] for the nongelled slurries because metal particles 
tend to agglomerate, or cluster around each other, and eventually 
settle  down  under  gravity.  Hence,  metalized  slurries  show  poor 
long-term stability and require remixing. The latter is possible only 
with Mg [60] . Hence, the capability to obtain a highly stable slurry 
formulation using a gellant is the best option as demonstrated by 
the results shown in Figs. 4 b 2 and 4 c. 

It  is  noteworthy  that  the  slurry  propellants  are  also  rheolog- 
ically  complex  and  therefore  challenges  faced  in  their  formula- 
tion, large-scale production, stability, handling, and atomization are 
similar  to  the  ones  recounted  further  for  the  gel  propellants  in 
Section 2.4 . 

Modiﬁcation of the physical state of aggregation of liquid pro- 
pellant  by  providing  a  more  robust  structural  framework  to  the 
propellant could be a viable alternative in this scenario and this 
possibility has led to the development of gel propellants [10] as 
another alternative to the conventional liquid propellants. In fact, 
improved  structural  stability  is  the  single  most  important  char- 
acteristic of the gel propellants that distinguishes them from the 
slurry fuels. Many other aspects of gel propellant formulation and 
stability have been revealed and new distinctions have been dis- 
covered. 

2.3. Gel propellants 

A gel is a ’soft matter’ behaving like solid and liquid, depend- 
ing upon the level of shear. It ﬁnds applications in various ﬁelds 
[ 67 , 68 ]. This combination of characteristics is facilitated using the 
gellants  [ 15 , 59 ].  Although  gels  can  be  deﬁned  variously  [68] ,  a 
three-dimensional solid skeleton enclosing the liquid phase along 
with some degree of elasticity is their most relevant feature [69] . 
These deﬁning features of a typical gel propellant are illustrated 
in Fig. 5 for silica based gel propellants. Fig. 5 shows the physical 
appearance of three gel propellants; p1 is a kerosene gel propel- 
lant using silica as gellant and additionally containing surfactant- 
stabilized nano-aluminum particles. p2 is a JP-8 gel propellant and 
p3 is a RP-1 gel propellant, each using 7 wt % silica as gellant. 

Their physical appearance suggests a soft amorphous solid. The 
solid  is  actually  held  together  by  H-bonded  silica  particles  that 
eventually form a network structure by clustering together and en- 
trapping the liquid propellant within the network. Nanoparticles of 
metal could remain suspended in the liquid phase. The gel evolves 
structurally over a considerable period and a spurt in viscous thick- 
ening as well as elastic build up is observed after a critical time. In 
Fig. 5 , the structural evolution is depicted in terms of the growth 
in viscosity ( η) and elastic modulus ( G’ ) with time ( t ). 

Physicochemical properties of propellants change after gelation. 
Just after gelation, and for some time during storage, viscosity in-

adopted from Refs. [70-72] . 

creases by many orders of magnitude over neat liquid propellants 
and density increases substantially, especially if metal particles are 
added in gels [73] . Heat of combustion also increases along with 
density  impulse  [59] ,  when  metals  are  added  [74] .  When  these 
changes  are  properly  exploited,  gel  propellants  could  provide  a 
greater degree of control over performance and handling, in addi- 
tion to the uniformity of composition, reproducibility of formula- 
tions, reliability, improved tendency to ﬂow under shearing action, 
and high energy content per unit mass or volume. 

2.4. Advantages and challenges 

Gel propellants combine the advantages of solid and liquid pro- 
pellants in them, as shown in Fig. 6 . Many of them, like the higher 
speciﬁc and density impulse [ 37 , 59 ], damping of sloshing due to 
the increased frequency at which the sloshing can occur [10] , re- 
duced weight,  etc.  are the improvements over liquid propellants 
due  to  their  increased  viscosity  and  improved  stability  of  metal 
suspensions  induced  by  gelation.  Gel  propellants  have  demon- 
strated a long-term storage without settling or separation for more 
than 10 years [ 15 , 16 , 33 , 75 ], and phase separation occurs only at 
high acceleration levels [15] . Other advantages, viz. no change in 
the energy management and no major problems with controls [10] , 
are fortuitous outcomes. Gel propellants have also shown promise 
in insensitive munitions (IM). The related progress in this area is 
discussed in a latter section. 

The  desirable  characteristics  of  gel  propellants  are  essentially 
the  same  as  liquid  propellants  as  far  as  the  performance,  stora- 
bility,  and  handling are  considered  [76] .  In  performance,  the  gel 
propellants should offer high speciﬁc impulse, high bulk density, 
low levels of combustion, two-phase, and expansion losses, as well 
as smooth ignition [76] . They should be safe to store, have favor- 
able bulk growth and slosh behavior, and good 0 g position control. 
Further, non-wetting and minimum remixing requirements are also 
desirable [76] . 

Colloidal state of gels permits suspension of metal particles ei- 
ther  within  the  gellant-liquid  matrix  or  on  its  surface  [51] ,  en- 
hancing the energy content, and density. Consequently, a smaller

amount  of  propellant  is  required,  which  is  advantageous  in  the 
volume-limited propulsion systems, for example in ramjet engines 
[37] , and results in the improvement of speciﬁc and density im- 
pulses. 

Due to the viscoelastic nature of many gels while stored un- 
der conditions of very low shear, susceptibility to leakage or spill 
during  storage,  transportation,  and  loading  stages  is  reduced.  In 
case of the hypergolic gel propellants, burning will occur only at 
the fuel-oxidizer interface. Tarpley [4] reported an extreme case in 
which the chemical interaction of gelled RFNA with air remained 
restricted to the exterior surface. When the contact ceases, the rhe- 
ological  nature  of  the  gels  (yield  stress  and  viscoelasticity,  com- 
bined with thixotropy) will prevent further ﬂow and chemical re- 
action [59] . Fewer vapors will be released because the volatility of 
gels is signiﬁcantly lower than the liquids [4] , thus reducing the 
toxicity levels in the immediate ambient. In case of the cryogenic 
gel  propellants,  boil-off,  geysering,  and  cavitation  might  also  re- 
duce signiﬁcantly. 

Gel propellants are less sensitive to impact, friction, and elec- 
trostatic discharge than solid propellants and hence they are less 
susceptible to accidental ignition, deﬂagration, detonation, or ther- 
mal runaway [32] . Some degree of viscoelasticity during the stor- 
age and solid to liquid transformation within the delivery system 
also eliminates the possibility of cracks in the propellant structure 
and consequent uncontrolled combustion [59] . 

However, signiﬁcant increase in the viscosity of gel propellant 
introduces diﬃculties of its own, which must be addressed satis- 
factorily since this can affect the overall performance of gel propul- 
sion system, an early example being that of JP-3 gel/Mg slurry pro- 
pellant considered previously in Fig. 4 d [66] . Fig. 7 depicts a num- 
ber of potential diﬃculties associated with a typical gel propellant. 
While the gels are known to possess exceptional stability dur- 
ing storage in some cases [ 15 , 16 , 33 , 75 ], stability usually deterio- 

rates gradually when long storage times are involved. Stability of 
gels  is  a  good  attribute  for  storage  and  safe  handling,  but  also 
poses a challenge for atomization, the process that involves frag- 
mentation of the gels and must rely on some form of structural 
instability to take advantage of the developing aerodynamic insta- 
bilities. Too much stable gel is invariably very viscous, diﬃcult to 
ﬂow, and atomize. Moreover, pressure drops required for gels in 
the pressure-fed system are higher than that of the liquid propel- 
lants at a given mass ﬂow rate due to viscosity and (to a smaller 
extent) yield stress. 

This drawback could result in a sub-optimal injector design and 
a loss of combustion stability [77] as explained in Section 5.9.2 . 
Usually, it is advisable to reduce the gel viscosity down to the mag- 
nitudes characteristic of conventional liquid propellants. An ad hoc 
measure is to provide additional means to decrease the viscosity 
and thereby control non-Newtonian behavior and enable ﬂow. At 
least one patent [78] suggested the use of heating of gel propellant 
for viscosity reduction and/or use of a radiation device to break the 
bonds of skeletal network of gellant at a predetermined frequency. 
Additionally, tubes of larger diameter are recommended to avoid 
clogging while transferring the gel propellants [10] . 

Poor quality of atomization has been observed in the gels be- 
cause of viscous resistance during the formation of ligaments from 
bulk jet, sheet, or ﬁlm and subsequently, during the formation of 
droplets from ligaments. This issue is complicated by the inﬂuence 
of multiple rheological properties of the gels and could also be- 
come important if the gels containing inorganic or organic partic- 
ulate gellants and/or metal particles are atomized in the conven- 
tional impinging jets. Some photographic evidence of the inﬂuence 
of particles on sheet breakup is now available (see, for example 
Refs. [ 77 , 79 ]). Injector clogging is another issue with the particu-

Fig. 8.  (a) Comparison of pressure drop-jet velocity curves for water and gels (data compiled from measurements reported in Refs. [ 47 , 48 , 50 , 81 ] and unpublished data 
on ISROsene-Thixatrol ST-micro-alumina gels), (b) condensed phase oxide products formed at the injector and ﬂame-holder after the combustion of 60 % Mg slurry in a 
simulated afterburner [64] , and (c) condensed phase products obtained from ramjet-type combustion of aluminized Jet A1 gel fuel [80] . 

suggest that the only solution to the diﬃculty  of atomization is 
to  operate  them  at  still  higher  pressure  drops,  or  else,  design 
new conﬁgurations. Rheological nature of the gels could also re- 
sult in delayed breakup of bulk state into ligaments and droplets in 
many cases. Consequently, larger droplet size, increased combustor 
length, and a reduced combustion eﬃciency could result. 

Further,  inherently  lower  burning  rate  of  a  gel  propellant 
than  liquid  propellant  from  which  it  was  formulated  results  in 
longer  combustor  length  (exceptions  to  this  are  discussed  in 
Section 6.8.4 ). Reduced burning rate is due to the use of inorganic 
non-combustible gellant like silica, as well as due to the delayed 
vaporization  of  liquid  propellant  trapped  in  the  skeletal  frame- 
work of the gellant. In addition, combustion of the inorganic gel- 
lant  based  gel  propellants,  or  metalized  propellants,  results  in  a 
solid residue [80] , injector clogging, combustion losses [80] , and 
restart problems [10] . All these drawbacks reduce the performance 
of the engine and decrease in combustion eﬃciency and speciﬁc 
impulse is likely. It should be noted that Fig. 6 indicates "higher 
speciﬁc impulse" as an advantage gained due to the capability of 
gel propellants to produce suspension of energetic nanoparticles so 
that the speciﬁc impulse of gel propellant is increased over that 
of the base liquid propellant. However, Fig. 7 lists "lower speciﬁc 
impulse" as a challenge because the various other challenges men- 
tioned in Fig. 7 eventually reduce the potential generated by stable 
suspension of energetic nanoparticles. This issue is considered fur- 
ther while discussing the applications of gel propellants in rocket 
and ramjet engines in Section 6.9 . 

Relationship  between  the  ﬂow  rate  through  an  oriﬁce  (sharp 
edged  sudden  contraction  or  gradually  converging)  and  the  re- 
quired  pressure  drop  can  be  represented  by  a  linear  curve  ﬁt- 
j )  against  ( (cid:4)P ) 0.5 ,  for  example 
ted  by  plotting  the  jet  velocity  ( u 
as done in Refs. [ 47-49 , 81 ]. Such a plot always results in a very 
small negative (or zero) y -intercept for Newtonian ﬂuid like wa- 
ter  [47]  and  a  large  negative  y -intercept  for  gels  [ 47 , 48 , 50 , 81 ]. 

In other terms, a minimum pressure drop ( (cid:4)P 
min ) that is partly 
due  to  the  internal  resistances  of  the  feeding  system  hardware 
and mostly due to the rheological nature of gels exempliﬁed by 
their high viscosity and ﬁnite yield stress always exists. The scat- 
ter  in  data  obtained  using  different  f eeding  systems,  oriﬁce  ge- 
ometries, and gel propellants and simulants of different viscosities 
(Refs.  [ 47 , 48 , 50 , 81 ]  and  unpublished  data  on  ISROsene-Thixatrol 
ST-micro-alumina gel system) was reduced using ( (cid:4)P- (cid:4)P 
min ) and 
u

in the pressure drop for a given feeding system and oriﬁce design. 
This observation has implications in such diverse issues as optimal 
formulation strategy and combustion instability in gel propulsion 
as discussed further in Section 3.6 and 5.9.2 , respectively. Rahimi 
(cid:4)P ) 
and Natan [82] previously deﬁned a ﬂow number ( F N =  ˙ m 
to  describe  the  ease  of  ﬂow  for  a  gel.  It  should  be  noted  that 
some studies (for example, Ref. [83] ) have presented the relation- 
j and (cid:4)P . However, the scaling introduced 
ship directly between u 
in Fig. 8 a helps to reduce the scatter in data and express the rela- 
tionship in terms of the injector parameter.

Fig. 8 b is an example of the clogging due to the oxides of mag- 
nesium when magnesium-JP-3 gel fuels were combusted in an af- 
terburner.  Metal  oxides  are  solid  phase  particles  that  agglomer- 
ate and clog the atomizer (in the center of the image) and ﬂame 
holder (shown on the periphery of combustor). 

Ramjet combustion of aluminized Jet A1-Thixatrol ST gel fuel 
further revealed the deﬁciency of low combustion eﬃciency when 
the condensed phase products were analyzed for aluminum con- 
tent. Fig. 8 c shows that very little conversion of aluminum could 
be achieved. The complete combustion of energetic metal particles 
in the available time is a major concern for metalized gel propel- 
lants. The dependence of metalized gel fuel performance on the

operating  conditions  is  further  considered  in  Sections  6.9.4  and 
6.9.5 . 

Above discussion suggests that the formulation of gel propel- 
lants  must  be  handled  carefully  because  it  determines  the  ﬂow 
behavior, atomization, combustion, and hence the overall perfor- 
mance of the gel fuel and oxidizer. In the next section, we consider 
these issues in greater detail. 

3. Formulation 

Formulation of the gel propellants is accomplished by dispers- 
ing the heterogeneous phases of gellant, solvent (optional), metal 
particles,  catalysts,  stabilizing  surfactants  (when  metals  are  in- 
cluded), and liquid propellant at room conditions or elevated tem- 
peratures, usually with the aid of a suitable impeller (mechanical 
mixing) or another mixing device (acoustic mixing). The order of 
inclusion of the above components can be speciﬁc at times and 
should be predetermined carefully. Incorporation of the metal par- 
ticles in a viscous liquid has been found more effective in some 
cases [84] . 

In this section, the composition and formulation procedures of 
gel propellants are described. Scale effects associated with the size 
of  a  gel  fuel  batch  are  also  discussed.  Formulation  is  often  the 
ﬁrst step in subsequent characterization of the behavior of the gel 
fuel. Our focus is on highlighting the complexity of the formula- 
tion stage in terms of the number of controlling factors and the 
ranges of the possible variations in their magnitudes. Possible link- 
ages and the inﬂuence the formulation stage has on the ﬂow, at- 
omization, and combustion properties of gels are also suggested in 
a number of cases. 

Many studies report on the different aspects of gel propellant 
formulation.  Chief  among  them  are,  the  choice  of  gellant  for  a 
given liquid propellant, conditions for the formulation of gel com- 
posed of a speciﬁed size and concentration of gellant, mixing rate 
and duration, temperature level during mixing, size and concentra- 
tion of energetic metal powders, concentration of other additives, 
the stability (required and inherent) and aging of a formulated gel, 
and the scale-up of formulation procedures. The preceding consid- 
erations are ultimately useful in deciding an optimal formulation 
procedure. All these aspects are considered in this section, begin- 
ning with the essential components of a gel propellant system. 

3.1. Composition 

3.1.1. Fuels and oxidizers 

Cryogenic  liquid  hydrogen  [ 8 , 85 , 86 ],  slush  hydrogen  [9]  fu- 
els,  hypergolic  fuels  including  hydrazine  [ 26 , 84 , 87 , 88 ],  MMH 
[ 5 , 16 , 26 , 42 , 43 , 84 , 88-92 ], UDMH [ 5 , 12 , 14 , 55 , 84 , 93-98 ], TMEDA [99] , 
DMAZ  [ 70 , 99 ],  various  grades  of  kerosene  based  jet  and  rocket 
fuels including JP (JP-1, JP-5, JP-8, and JP-10) [ 5 , 20 , 22-24 , 26 , 60 , 63- 
[ 27 , 31 , 32 , 36 , 44 , 49 , 52- 
66 , 71 , 87-89 , 100 , 101 , 102-105 ], 
54 , 56 , 80 , 106-112 ],  RP-1  [ 15 , 29 , 71 , 89 , 100 , 105 , 113-116 ],  ISROsene 
[ 77 , 79 ],  alcoholic  fuels  such  as  methanol  [ 1 , 91 ]  and  ethanol 
[ 1 , 57 , 117-118 ],  and  nitromethane  [ 5 , 29 , 119 ]  have  been  gelled. 
Some  studies  specify  liquid  fuel  generically  by  its  class,  for 
example kerosene [ 29 , 35 , 45 , 70 , 93 ]. 

Jet  A1 

Other liquid fuels which have been gelled include isopropanol 
[1] ,  fuel  oils  [6] ,  waste  organic  solvents  like  benzene,  ace- 
tone  and  chlorinated  solvents  [6] ,  naphtha  [6] ,  nitromethane 
[ 29 , 107 , 108 , 120 ], ethanol amine [58] , aniline [5] , nitropropane [5] , 
isooctane [29] , hexane [ 85 , 86 ], propane [86] , ethane [86] , paraﬃn 
[32] , and ethyl ammonium nitrate [121] . 

Oxidizers  that  have  been  successfully  used  in  the  gel  form 
chieﬂy belong to the class of hypergolic propellants and include 
RFNA  [ 4 , 12 , 13 , 29 , 89 , 90 , 95 ],  IRFNA  [ 4 , 16 , 26 , 88 ],  hydrogen  perox- 
ide  [ 26 , 29 , 87 , 88 , 121 ],  as  well  as  cryogenics  such  as  substituted 

bromine triﬂuoride [4] , bromine pentaﬂuoride-chlorine triﬂuoride 
[4] , liquid oxygen [ 122 , 123 ], and oxygen diﬂuoride, and also a large 
number of nitroalkanes [2] and nitrogen tetroxide [2] . 

Cryogenic  liquid  propellants  were  among  the  ﬁrst  candidates 
for  conversion  into  gel  propellants  [ 8-10 , 76 , 124 ].  Development 
work  on  cryogenic  gel  propellants  successfully  navigated  the 
unique handling requirements of low-temperature liquids and in- 
novative formulations were developed. An apparatus for cryogenic 
processing of liquid hydrogen, liquid nitrogen, and slush hydrogen 
has  been  described  by  Rapial  and  Daney  [9] .  They  used  a  com- 
mercial silica product (Cab-O-Sil®), an inert solid oxide that de- 
grades the speciﬁc impulse, and aimed to reduce its loading by us- 
ing slush hydrogen in liquid hydrogen. 

3.1.2. Gellants 

A gellant evolves a stable solid structure while aging by form- 
ing  bonds  with  the  molecules  of  liquid  propellant.  This  skeletal 
structural  framework  can  evolve  very  quickly  during  cooling  of 
the batch for some gellants and appropriate precautions should be 
taken while handling a freshly prepared batch. Gellant should be 
carefully selected because its chemical composition and concentra- 
tion, degree of achievable dispersion, gelation period, and temper- 
ature  inﬂuence  the  gellant-propellant  molecular  interactions  and 
directly affect the mechanical, ﬂow, and combustion properties of 
gels [125] . 

Signiﬁcant amount of work involving formulation has focused 
on the identiﬁcation of suitable gellant types for gelling speciﬁc 
fuel  and  oxidizer  [ 59 , 88 , 126 ].  Table  2  lists  a  number  of  gellant- 
propellant pairs  and  processing  conditions.  Extensive  list  is  sup- 
plied in the Supplementary Material. In the following, all compo- 
nent fractions are given in wt % unless speciﬁed otherwise. Most 
of the gellants are commercially available off-the-shelf compounds. 
Inorganic and organic gellants (many of them are polymeric) are 
used and a gellant is selected in accordance with the following cri- 
teria. Tarpley mentioned many of these criteria in an early work on 
gel propellants [5] and many gellant-propellant combinations [4- 
6] and methods for their formulation have been revealed, as sum- 
marized in Tables 1 and 2 . Some of the desirable characteristics of 
a good gellant for gel propellant are: it should be required in the 
minimum concentration, it should be combustible, it should pro- 
vide a reversible gel system, and it should be non-corrosive, safe, 
and economical. 

Inorganic gellants like silica, gel well with both fuel and oxi- 
dizer [ 40 , 70 ]. However, they are inert and contribute to the com- 
bustion losses and restart problems. Hence, it is essential to min- 
imize  the  concentration  of  silica  in  gel.  This  could  be  achieved 
by  inducing  more  particle-particle  interactions  [100]  as  the  hy- 
drophilic  groups  on  the  surface  of  particles  promote  hydrogen 
bonds. The solvents (liquid propellants) could then be chosen as 
hydrophobic compounds [100] and gels could form with 3-6 wt % 
silica. With hydrophilic compounds, the required silica concentra- 
tion is in the range 10-15 wt %. Acids (potential oxidizers), alcohols 
(potential  fuels),  and  water  (potential  simulant)  are  hydrophilic 
[100] . Many hydrocarbons (potential fuels) are hydrophobic [100] . 
Henceforth, all proportions of components would be expressed as 
wt %, unless noted otherwise. 

Polymeric  gellants like  Carbopol®,  cellulose  compounds,  Xan- 
than®, etc. are being utilized for gelling the water-based "gel pro- 
pellant simulants" (water is often used for laboratory tests in lieu 
of the hazardous propellants such as UDMH and MMH) in propul- 
sion  applications  [59] .  These  compounds  are  linear  or  branched 
chain polymers and form a strong entangled or cross-linked net- 
work via hydrogen bonds when dispersed in water [51] . Cellulose 
compounds  and  agar  can  gel  only  with  fuels.  Although  the  rhe- 
ology of these polymeric gels exhibits shear-thinning characteris- 
tics, molecular bonding of polymer chains with water resists the 

15

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 83 (2021) 100885 

liquid breakup and subsequent spray formation, thus impairing at- 
omization [127] . However, atomization could be achieved with agar 
as  a  gellant,  which  absorbs  water  and  forms  a  network  around 
the  liquid  phase,  rather  than  bonding  with  its  molecules  [127] . 
These examples are illustrative of the vital importance of gellant- 
liquid interaction in atomization and further underscore the need 
for proper selection of a gellant. Brandenburg et al. [128] disclosed 
an ethanol gel fuel using methyl cellulose (MC) and formulated for 
a hybrid rocket engine as 85:5:10 composition by mass of ethanol, 
water, and MC. They also claimed a combination of MC with an al- 
kali metal acetate as well as diethylene glycol dimethacrylate as a 
cross-linking agent. Rheology of a ethanol-MC (or HPMC) gel fuel 
has  since  been  studied  [ 129 , 130 ].  Elliott  et  al.  [131]  disclosed  a 
method and apparatus for gelling liquid propane and mixed ox- 
ides of nitrogen (MON-30) intended for divert and attitude control 
systems (DACS). Use of different inorganic as well as polymeric gel- 
lants along with energetic metal additives is also claimed for their 
method and apparatus. 

Unlike the polymeric gels, some organogels use low-molecular 
weight  gellants  capable  of  gelling  with  organic  liquids  [125] . 
Organogels  resemble  polymeric  gels  in  terms  of  the  framework 
of  gellant-solvent  molecular  network  and  the  entrapped  liquid 
phase  and  are  especially  suited  for  propulsion  because  their  at- 
omization  is  easier  than  polymeric  gels  due  to  the  reduced  ex- 
tensional viscosity component. Moreover, they combust along with 
the  liquid  fuel  and  oxidizer.  Castor  oil  derivative  Thixcin  R  was 
used  for  gelling  the  slurry  of  coal  and  No.  2  oil  [6]  and  for  Jet 
A1  [75] .  Many  recent  studies  used  another  castor  oil  derivative 
Thixatrol  as  non-polymeric  organic  gellant  [ 27 , 31 , 32 , 36 , 44 , 49 , 52- 
54 , 56 , 75 , 77 , 79 , 80 , 106-112 ].  Thixatrol  ST  is  another  such  gellant 
that  has  been  used  extensively  in  the  formulation  of  Jet  A1 
gels [ 27 , 32 , 44 , 49 , 52-54 , 56 , 77 , 79 , 80 , 106 , 107 , 109-112 ], characterized 
in  multiple  rheological  tests  [ 36 , 53 ],  used  in  many  atomization 
studies [ 36 , 49 , 52 , 53 , 77 , 79 , 110 , 111 ], and has also been used in ram- 
jet  combustion  [ 32 , 36 , 80 , 109 ],  atmospheric  droplet  combustion 
[ 54 , 112 ], and most recently in spray combustion on a bluff body 
assisted burner [56] . Different castor oil derivatives have also been 
used  apart  from  Thixatrol  ST,  including  MPA  60  [126] ,  Thixatrol 
289 [23] , Thixcin R [ 6 , 75 ], and Thixatrol Plus [27] . Byk gel [107] is 
another low-molecular weight organic gellant. Mention should also 
be made of colophonium, which is a gelling agent that dissolves 
directly in some fuels, especially gasoline [7] . 

the 

used 

Among 

inorganic  gellants,  and  perhaps  among 
all  the  gellants  tested  so  far,  silica  has  been  most  ex- 
[ 8 , 12 , 13 , 22 , 26 , 27 , 29 , 31 , 35 , 43 , 58 , 70 , 71 , 84 , 87- 
tensively 
Cab-O-Sil 
90 , 93 , 100 , 101 , 104 , 105 , 107 , 108 , 113-115 , 120 , 126 ] 
(henceforth  Cabosil)  and  Aerosil®.  Care  should  be  exercised 
in  the  choice  between  these  commercially  available  silica  gel- 
lants.  Silica  has  also  been  used  as  ’ﬁller’  in  combination  with 
Carbopol  [81] .  A  pumpable  monopropellant  of  hydrazine  and 
ammonium perchlorate gelled with colloidal silica [122] has also 
been considered. 

as 

Among the polymeric gellants, Carbopol®, a crosslinked poly- 
acrylic  acid,  is  the  preferred  gellant  when  water  gel  simu- 
lants  are  used  in  lieu  of  the  hazardous  hypergolic  gel  pro- 
pellants [ 15 , 17 , 18 , 21 , 26 , 39 , 46 , 47 , 50 , 51 , 81 , 82 , 85 , 88 , 126 , 127 , 132 , 133 ]. 
Many other polymeric gellants have been used, chief among them 
include  agar,  a  polysaccharide  [ 12 , 40 , 48 , 87 , 89 , 93 , 134 ]  hydrox- 
ypropyl  cellulose  (HPC)  [ 26 , 40 , 42 , 43 , 88-92 , 96 , 135 ],  Xanthan  gum 
[ 40 , 89 , 100 , 136 ], methyl cellulose (MC) [ 12 , 14 , 84 , 93 , 118 ], propyl cel- 
lulose  [57] ,  PVP  [58] ,  Cekol  [ 40 , 89 ],  ι-  and  κ-carrageenan  [89] , 
ethyl  cellulose  [93] ,  carboxymethyl  cellulose  (CMC)  [ 84 , 93 , 136 ], 
hydroxy  methyl  cellulose  (HMC)  [93] ,  organophilic  clay  complex 
(OCC) [ 45 , 93 ], hydroxy ethyl cellulose [ 26 , 84 , 88 ], PVA [84] , highly- 
substituted methyl cellulose (HSMC) [98] , guar gum [29] , kelcogel 

16 

[89] , tetraethoxysilane [86] , alkoxide (BTMSE and BTMSH) [ 85 , 86 ], 
AO [88] , polyacrylamide (PAA) [137] , and HPMC [84] . 

Among  the  cryogenic  gel  propellants, a  unique  example  is  of 
high-energy and low-density lithium and lithium borohydride solid 
fuels as gellants for liquid hydrogen [8] . The matching of gellant 
with fuel in this case is dictated by properties of LH 
2 . Experience 
with the cryogenic gel propellants underscores the connections be- 
tween propellant development and combustion. They also demon- 
strate that the reduction of gellant concentration, use of a com- 
bustible  gellant,  and  compatibility  with  fuel  in  terms  of  density 
and particle size are key factors for the development of optimal 
cryogenic gel propellant formulations. 

It appears that a large number of combinations between a liq- 
uid propellant and gellant have been proposed. Unfortunately, very 
few among them have ever been employed in the experiments on 
atomization and combustion. 

3.1.3. Energetic metals 

nanometric 

Metallic  powders  and  surface-active  chemicals  are  the 
most  common  additives  used  in  gel  fuels.  Metallic  pow- 
ders 
[ 47 , 51 , 57 , 58 , 70 , 77 , 79 , 80 , 114 , 116 , 122 ] 
are 
[ 12 , 14 , 15 , 45 , 60 , 80 , 84-86 , 93 , 106 , 107 , 113 , 115 ]. 
or  micrometric 
Size  range  for  the  nanometric  powders  is  50-320  nm 
[ 47 , 51 , 57 , 58 , 70 , 77 , 79 , 80 , 114 , 116 , 122 ]  and  1.2-60  μm  for  micro- 
metric powders [ 15 , 45 , 80 , 84-86 , 93 , 106 , 107 , 113 , 115 ]. 

Over  the  years,  metals  including  boron  [ 23 , 60 ],  magnesium 
[ 60 , 84 , 109 ], aluminum [ 15 , 16 , 29 , 45 , 70 , 80 , 84-86 , 93 , 106 , 107 , 109 , 113- 
116 ],  and  steel  [ 47 , 51 ]  have  been  used.  Additional  examples  can 
be found in the subsequent sections of this review. Applications 
of  other  additive  energetic  materials  such  as  elemental  carbon 
[ 16 , 70 ],  lithium  nitrate  [16] ,  and  boron  carbide  [ 102 , 103 ]  have 
also been reported. Recently, nano-alumina powder was also used 
[ 77 , 79 ] as relatively cheap substitute for nano-aluminum in rheo- 
logical and atomization studies. 

Concentration of the metals is an important factor if they are to 
be used as an energetic additive. Usual range of metal fraction by 
weight is 5-60 %. Fractions in the 30-40 % range are more com- 
mon  [ 12 , 14 , 15 , 23 , 45 , 47 , 51 , 70 , 80 , 84-86 , 93 , 102 , 103 , 106 , 107 , 109 , 113- 
116 , 122 ].  Relatively  low  concentrations  of  metals  are  not  useful 
for propulsion applications of gel propellants. Higher proportion of 
the metals is required in slurry propellants [ 60 , 102 , 103 ] and highly 
loaded slurry propellants are already known. 

Fig. 9 compares the heats of combustion of many liquid fuels 
and energetic metals, all of which have been considered for novel 
propellant formulations at one or other time albeit with mixed re- 
sults. For comparison purpose, heats of combustion of gases and 
hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) are also given in the in- 
set of Fig. 9 . HTPB ( (cid:3)) could be considered as a representative solid 
fuel. Gravimetric and volumetric heats of combustion are used for 
comparison and they are related by the density of fuel such that a 
higher density would increase (cid:2)H 
C,volum . Fuels in a particular cate- 
gory are numbered in the increasing order of (cid:2)H 

c,gravi . 

c,gravi = 42-48 MJ/kg and (cid:2)H 

The  most  common  hydrocarbon  liquid  fuels  (indices  10-20) 
cluster in the ranges (cid:2)H 
c,volum = 32-42 
kJ/cm 3 ( (cid:2), see inset at the top left of Fig. 9 ) and the heats of com- 
bustion of metals vary by a wide margin (metals with indices 24- 
27 are the most commonly used). The rationale for mixing metals 
with liquid fuels rests on the ability of the resulting slurries to give 
a higher net thrust per kg of oxidizer (or air). The preference is 
for using the metals with higher volumetric and gravimetric heat- 
ing values because of the increase in the range. It is known that 
Mg gives the highest net thrust per kg of air under stoichiomet- 
ric mixture ratios and is closely followed by Al [138] . In practice, 
Al 
3 is sticky and melts at normal ﬂame temperatures [ 80 , 138 ], 
while boron is diﬃcult to combust [139] . Oxides of magnesium do 
not melt and hence Mg could be the best choice of metal for met-

Use  of  water  with  speciﬁc  gellants  as  a  simulant  also  ex-

Carbopol 
or 
126 , 127 , 132 , 133 ].  Many  other  propellant-gellant  combinations 
have  been  tried  as  gel  simulants.  For  example,  Palaszewski  and 
coworkers [ 85 , 86 ] used hexane, ethane, and propane as simulant 
2  gels  along  with  gellants  such  as  alkoxides 
propellants  for  H 
(BTMSE, BTMSH) and tetraethoxysilane. 

An effective gel simulant needs what is termed as ’rheological 
matching’ [87] since similarity of rheological properties is essen- 
tial to study the atomization properties of the gel propellant under 
consideration. Rahimi et al. [87] demonstrated the procedure for 
rheologically matching a gel simulant to the actual gel propellant. 
It is discussed further in Section 4.7 . 

3.2. Formulation procedures 

In the following, we consider procedures followed for the dif- 
ferent combinations of liquids and gellants using studies selected 
based  on  the  details  given  on  the  procedures  and  the  param- 
eters  affecting  formulation.  The  procedure  for  gelation  could  be 
straightforward  in  some  cases,  especially  at  the  laboratory-scale. 
As an example [122] , gels of volatile hydrazine were prepared by 
ﬁlling  the  vessel  with  hydrazine  and  then  slowly  adding  up  to 
3  %  colloidal  silica  with  agitation.  The  suspension  was  gelled  at 
the end of two minutes. Similar procedure was adopted for RFNA 
gel with 4 % colloidal silica [122] . Table 3 summarizes the oper- 
ating  conditions  found  useful  for  gel  propellants  formulated  us- 
ing  the  four  possible  combinations  of  liquids  and  gellants;  fuel- 
polymeric gellant, oxidizer-inorganic gellant, fuel-inorganic gellant, 
and fuel-non-polymeric (particulate) organic gellant. Examples of 
these combinations are shown in Table 3 . 

Combinations involving the organic gellants and oxidizers have 
not been attempted because most of the oxidizers are highly reac- 
tive towards organic gellants. Agitation and mixing is always re- 
quired  during  formulation  and  it  is  accomplished  by  one  of  the 
available  techniques  involving  mechanical  [ 12 , 44 , 71 , 75 , 84 , 104 ]  or 
ultrasonic [ 70 , 71 ] energy. Formulations of gel propellants of these 
combinations are now described brieﬂy. 

Varma and coworkers [ 12 , 84 ] described the gelation of UDMH 
by many organic polymeric gellants. Same procedure was used for 
all  combinations.  However,  exothermic  mixing  was  noticed  with 
some gellants, with temperature rising by 12-30 °C. Such gellants 
were rejected in favor of MC and A-A because viscosity and stabil- 
ity was affected by evolution of heat. Munjal et al. [12] gelled RFNA 
using sodium silicate by following a substantially same procedure. 
Santos  et  al.  [71]  described  the  gelation  of  JP-8  by  inorganic 
silica gellant. Conventional low-shear impeller based and acoustic 
resonance based mixing methods were used. ’Stiffness’ of the so- 
lution resulted in poor mixing, long mixing duration, and less vis- 
cous gels after conventional mixing. Brandle et al. [104] used the 
conventional Cowles  blade impeller and  considered the  effect  of 
impeller diameter and mixing rate on the quality of the gel. 

Padwal  and  Mishra  [44]  and  Varma  and  Pein  [75]  described 
gelation of Jet A1 by Thixatrol ST and Thixcin R, respectively. Kim 
et al. [143] have successfully adopted the formulation procedure 
proposed  by  Padwal  and  Mishra  [44]  for  gelling  the  aluminized 
Jet A1 by Thixatrol ST. They did not use xylene as carrier solvent 
and instead required longer mixing times. Organic gellants Thix- 
atrol  ST  and  Thixcin  R  are  the  low-molecular  weight  derivatives 
of castor oil. In their search for optimal formulation, Padwal and 
Mishra [44] followed a protocol that integrated the operating con- 
ditions inﬂuencing formulation procedure with the ultimate goals 
of achieving a stable and atomizable gel. Conventional high-shear 
mixing was found adequate because the rise in viscosity of the so-

liquid, and solid fuels including metals and carbon. 

alized gel fuels. Effective use of boron needs more elaborate strat- 
egy, for example combustion in an aft-burner using the bypass air 
as suggested by Natan and Gany [ 139 , 140 ]. 

In a novel approach, Wickman experimented with metal based 
monopropellants stabilized by Cabosil [123] . Liquid O 
2 was mixed 
with metals including Al, Al/Mg (80/20), Fe, and Si and 2-3 % Ca- 
bosil was added for gelation of this mixture to create a gel mono- 
propellant. In another study [137] , pyral (ﬂaky Al) was mixed in 
aq. PAA to form a soft rubbery propellant, reminiscent of the older 
’solid’ gel propellants. 

3.1.4. Additives and solvents 

Surfactants in very small concentrations (usually less than 1 %) 
are used to achieve stable dispersion of nano-powders by wetting 
them effectively with the liquid propellant. Many surfactants were 
tested during the gel slurry studies at NACA [60] . Polyoxyethylene 
sorbitan trioleate was used during the demonstration of acoustic 
mixing technology [70] , Tween 85 was used to suspend Al pow- 
der in RP-1 [113-115] , and oleic acid was used for suspending the 
nano-alumina powders in a rocket propellant [ 77 , 79 ]. 

In  some  cases,  a  gellant  requires  another  carrier  solvent  be- 
fore it could be mixed in the liquid propellant. This is especially 
the  case  for  castor  oil  derivatives  such  as  MPA  60  [126] ,  Thix- 
cin  R  [75] ,  Thixatrol  Plus  [27] ,  Thixatrol  289  [23] ,  and  Thixatrol 
ST  [ 27 , 32 , 44 , 56 , 80 , 106 , 107 , 109 ],  which  can  be  dissolved  in  well- 
known  organic  solvents  such  as  methyl  isoamyl  ketone  (MIAK) 
[ 23 , 24 , 32 , 80 , 106 , 107 , 109 ], xylene [ 44 , 126 ], 5-Methyl 2-Hexanone or 
IMH [27] , and mineral spirit [126] . Incidentally, it is also possible 
to use xylene-MPA 60 and mineral spirit-MPA 60 as gel fuels [126] . 
OCCs [ 45 , 93 ] have been dissolved in polyethylene glycol [ 45 , 93 ]. 

3.1.5. Gel simulants 

Water is a common simulant and control ﬂuid for liquid pro- 
pellants and additives can be used to simulate the properties of 
many liquid propellants suitably by altering the density, viscosity, 
and surface tension. In a restricted sense, the resulting simulant is 
expected to possess similar properties as actual propellants and it 
should be additionally easy and economical to handle. A propel- 
lant simulant is typically useful for studying the rheological and 
atomization characteristics.

lution was not signiﬁcant during most of the mixing time. A pilot- 
scale formulation procedure capable of producing 1.2-2 kg gel pro- 
pellant was successfully implemented with relatively small mixing 
and gelation time. Varma and Pein [75] considered the effects of 
operating conditions on the gelation of Jet A1 by Thixcin R using 
conventional mixing technology. A long mixing time ( ∼90 0 0 s) was 
required for the completion of gelation, unlike the case with Thixa- 
trol ST [44] . Physical appearance of many gel propellants and their 
simulants is depicted in Fig. 10 , in which the images are arranged 
according to the type of gellant. 

Except the ﬁrst and second images shown in Fig. 10 c (for which 
acoustic resonance was used to achieve mixing), these gels were 
obtained using a conventional mixing technology. Typical solid-like 
appearance of the gel propellants is found in most of the images, 
except for the ﬁrst case shown in Fig. 10 a, where the gel is com- 
paratively less viscous and with a honey-like consistency. 

ISROsene-Thixatrol ST gel mixed with 1 % of micro-alumina par- 
ticles. Sol was poured in a laboratory beaker and allowed to cool 
under ambient conditions. The cylindrical cast was then extracted. 
Particular colorations in Fig. 10 are adopted by the gels in accor- 
dance with the color of propellant, gellant material or additives, as 
the case may be. 

Another method for the formulation of gels, and their storage at 
very low temperatures, was investigated by Vershinina et al. [144] . 
The fuels were liquid combustible wastes. The usual mixing step 
was followed by freezing at 253 K upon gelation to a low tem- 
perature. The gels retained structural stability when brought to the 
room temperature ( ∼293 K). The strength and elasticity of gels im- 
proved upon repeated freezing and thawing cycles  of  12 h each 
[144] by removing water. Gels formulated using this method have 
been investigated for their ignition and indicate signiﬁcant delays, 
as discussed in Section 6.5.1 . 

3.3. Mechanisms of gelation 

In  general,  a  gel  propellant  forms  by  de-agglomeration, 
swelling,  and  gelation  [ 68 , 69 ],  as  illustrated  schematically  in 
Fig. 11 . Gellant agglomerates and additives are introduced into the 
propellant ( 1 ) and de-agglomeration occurs under shear (may be 
induced by impeller) and/or high temperature ( 2 ). Resulting solu- 
tion (sol) contains more or less uniformly dispersed particles of the 
gellant and additives. Upon cooling ( 3 ), the gellant molecules ab- 
sorb the surrounding liquid propellant and swell to a certain de- 
gree by local clustering. They might cross-link to form bigger clus- 
ters by covalent, Coulombic, hydrogen, coordination bonds or phys- 
ical interactions ( 4 ), depending upon the type of gellant [ 68 , 69 ]. 
Clusters, as used here, could refer to the networks of polymeric 
or particulate gellants, as the case may be. The gel formation is 
usually  recognized  at  the  molecular  level,  when  the  sol  trans- 
forms  completely  into  gel  (i.e.  by  changing  its  state  from  liquid 
to semi-solid). Metal particles might also play a role in determin- 
ing the strength of the framework [51] , as described in detail in 
Section 4.3 . 

Growth  of  these  small  clusters  by  condensation  of  polymeric 
gellant  molecules  or  agglomeration  of  particulate  gellants  until 
they collide and link with the neighboring (similarly growing) clus- 
ters is the simplest phenomenological description of the gelation 
process [68] . The linking gradually forms larger clusters that even- 
tually span the entire vessel, completely immobilizing the sol so 
that it cannot be poured [68] . Gelation is a gradual process and 
many small clusters are initially in the sol state. Once the linking 
is complete, abrupt rise in viscosity and elasticity (as depicted pre- 
viously  in  Fig.  5 )  is  observed.  Rate  of  increase  or  completion  of 
gelation is a function of parameters selected during formulation. 
Thus,  gelation  time  could  vary  between  a  few  seconds  to  many 
hours [68] . Determination of gelation time could be accomplished 
by many methods that seek to interpret the dynamic rheology of 
the gel [68] . 

Moreover, gelation process could also be investigated, at least 
approximately, using theoretical analysis. Santos et al. [146] have 
tracked the Brownian dynamics and simulated the gelation of weak 
viscoelastic particulate gels. Their simulations mimic the clustering 
process depicted in Fig. 11 and also enable investigations of the 
relationship  between  microstructural  and  macroscopic  viscoelas- 
ticity  parameters.  In  particular,  they  reveal  the  stretched  expo- 
nential growth of elasticity [146] during gelation, as discussed in 
Section 2.3 and Fig. 5 . 

Gels can be scooped in portions (second image in Fig. 10 a and 
ﬁrst image in Fig. 10 b). Some gel propellants are capable of sup- 
porting  their  weight  as  freestanding  columns  without  slumping. 
Second image in Fig. 10 b shows a particular case of this type for 

It  should  be  noted  that  for  propulsion  applications,  gel  pro- 
cessing  requires  solvent  to  be  present,  unlike  many  other  ap- 
plications  of  gels  in  which  only  the  solid  structural  network  is 
useful.

Fig. 11.  Steps in gelation process. 

Continuity of the solid structure imparts elasticity to a gel be- 
cause the gellant traps the surrounding liquid propellant (and car- 
rier  solvent)  inside  itself  and  swells  in  due  course  of  time.  This 
process  transforms  the  initially  less  viscous  liquid  to  a  more  or 
less elastic solid, depending upon the processing conditions. The 
ﬁnal  gel  structure  is  a  three-dimensional  network  held  together 
by  strong  bonds  or  weak  physical  interactions  (hydrogen  bonds, 
Coulomb forces, or ionic forces) [67-69] . 

Tarpley [4] suggested that although carbon black will usually 
form unstable system with an oxidizer, carbon black prepared by 
continuous  thermal  decomposition  of  acetylene  gas  would  be  in 
the form of colloidal size particles. These particles are capable of 
forming continuous chain-like structures and hence the resulting 
three-dimensional structure is capable of trapping the oxidizer liq- 
uid,  leading  to  successful  gelation.  The  role  of  gellant  type  and 
gelation  mechanisms  has  been  discussed  in  Refs.  [ 40 , 51 , 71 ]  and 

brieﬂy  summarized  by  Padwal  and  Mishra  [53] .  Baek  and  Kim 
[51] suggested that Carbopol 934 gellant contains strongly coiled 
molecules that are tightly knotted via hydrogen bonding once hy- 
drated by water. However, neutralization by aq. NaOH to a p H = 6- 
10 speeds up the gelation by uncoiling the chains via repulsion and 
triggers swelling in the gellant as it absorbs the water molecules 
and forms a uniform gel. 

Santos et al. [71] have explained the gelation of JP-8 and RP- 
1 by fused particle chains of fumed silica on the basis of hydro- 
gen bonds between the hydroxyl and siloxane groups. Dennis et al. 
[40] found that molecular bonding between water and polymeric 
Cekol gellant molecules and entanglement are detrimental to the 
atomization of such gels. However, network structure of A-A (dis- 
cussed in more detail below and shown in Fig. 12 b) around wa- 
ter  gives  a  gel  that  can  be  atomized  relatively  easily  instead  of 
bonding. Padwal and Mishra [53] suggested that Thixatrol ST units

would form a three-dimensional network structure by joining via 
hydrogen bonds and Jet A1 would be entrapped. 

Munjal  et  al.  [12]  reported  experimental  observations  on  the 
exact  appearance  of  the  gellant  network  with  the  help  of  pho- 
tomicrographs of three types of gels. The probable mechanisms for 
gelation were then constructed using the known behavior of gel- 
lants and the photomicrographs as shown in Fig. 12 . Fig. 12 a shows 
the chainlike structure of MC particles swollen with UDMH. An en- 
tanglement of the particles and further entrapment of liquid pro- 
pellant follow the swelling. The overall gel structure is surmised to 
be miscellar and the interparticle bonding is considered to be hy- 
drogen bonds. Corresponding scanning electron micrographic im- 
age reveals a random network of MC particles and the space occu- 
pied by liquid propellant. 

A-A gave a ﬁne granular structure as shown in Fig. 12 b because 
its colloidal particles formed hydrogen bonds with water molecules 
used for dispersion [12] . SEM image showed that some of the A-A 
particles also formed lumps and ﬁbrils. In the case of RFNA-sodium 
silicate gel, the gelation is supposed to be triggered by a reaction 
between the gellant and RFNA leading to the formation of needle- 
shaped  hydrosilicic  acid  particles  [12] .  These  particles  migrated 
randomly and formed an irregular skeletal framework for immobi- 
lization of the RFNA as shown in Fig. 12 c. The three-dimensional 
skeleton  of  these  particles  is  also  seen  from  the  corresponding 
image. 

3.4. Effects of operating conditions 

Preceding sections indicate that a gel propellant is a multicom- 
ponent  mixture  of  many  chemicals  and  a  large  number  of  fac- 
tors enter into consideration while attempting its formulation. As 
shown in Fig. 13 , these factors can be grouped into mixing con- 
ditions, concentration, and particle characteristics. Evidently, all of 
them can enter into consideration in the case of metalized gel pro- 
pellants.  The  exact  requirements  and  quantitative  details  of  the 
identiﬁed operating conditions vary from case to case and a few 
studies have considered their effects on the gelation time. Some 
of these variables are considered now, and additional effects are 
taken up in the subsequent sections. 

Fig. 13.  Operating conditions considered for the formulation of gel propellants. Im- 
age adopted from Ref. [44] . 

Fig. 14 illustrates the extent of inﬂuence of the operating con- 
gelation ), a measure of the time taken 
ditions on the gelation time ( t 
to form gel after the completion of mixing. It compiles the exper- 
imental data on UDMH gels [12] . Fig. 14 a combines the effects of 
three factors, concentration of metal ( Y M = 0-40 %), type of gellant 
(MC or A-A), and type of metal (Al or Mg). The trends could be ﬁt- 
ted by exponential curves in the available range of data ( R 2 = 0.85- 
0.97). 

According  to  these  trends,  t 

gelation  decreases  exponentially  at 
high metal concentration. This behavior hints at the ability of met- 
als to inﬂuence the gelation process rather than just remain sus- 
pended by virtue of gellant. This possibility is also supported by 
the observed decrease in the minimum gellant concentration [12] . 
In fact, the highly dense slurries of Mg and B metals ( Y M = 60 %) 
in JP series fuels are known to remain stable for months [60] and 
gellant could be used to extend their stability even longer. Com- 
parison of the trends for the two metals suggest that, the other 
conditions remaining same, the gelation times of Al and Mg are 
similar and delay in the gelation of Mg particles could be due to 
their larger size in comparison to Al. 

Fig.  14 b  shows  that  gelation  time  for  the  UDMH  gels  formu- 
lated using MC and A-A depends upon the mechanism of gelation

when the temperature used during mixing is varied in the 0-30 °C 
range. In case of UDMH-MC system, the immobilization of UDMH 
is favored by a higher mixing temperature because it leads to the 
opening of miscellar structure of the gel [12] . On the other hand, 
increased  randomness  of  the  colloidal  A-A  particles  with  higher 
temperature is supposed to hinder their alignment and delay the 
formation of network structures [12] (see Fig. 12 b), leading to a 
longer t 

gelation for UDMH-A-A system. 

Besides these factors, Munjal et al. [12] also found that an 80 
% decrease in the particle size of gellant MC sped up the gelation 
process by 90 % because of the enhanced surface area per unit vol- 
ume of particles and better wetting by UDMH fuel. 

Improved  mixing  technology  could  also  reduce  the  gelation 
time, as found by Santos et al. [71] in case of JP-8-fumed silica gels. 
The eﬃciency of conventional impeller based mixer decreased be- 
cause the mixture turned more viscous during mixing. Contactless 
mixing by acoustic waves improved the wetting of gellant by JP-8 
fuel and resulted in uniform gelation with higher viscosity and bet- 
ter stability. 

3.5. Stability and aging 

Gels formed via the covalent bonding are irreversible in nature 
(chemical gels) and those formed by weaker interactions like hy- 
drogen, ionic, or coordination bonds, or by physical entanglement 
of the polymer chains, are reversible (physical) gels [67-69] . Conse- 
quently, the physical/reversible gels are less stable than the chem- 
ical gels. The issue of gel stability is relevant for storage and deter- 
mines its shelf life. Gels could be stored for years if they are sta- 
ble [ 16 , 59 ]. Therefore, it is important that the gel stability is ascer- 
tained using many tests while it is being stored and ’aged’. Gellants 
and surfactants are primarily responsible for imparting structural 
stability to the gel propellants. Indicators of an unstable or dete- 
riorating gel include the loss of propellant by vaporization, devel- 
opment of overhead pressure in the storage tanks, synerisis, onset 
of density gradients along the height of tank, separation of metal 
particles, and formation of decomposition products. 

Rapp and Zurawski [15] presented a general discussion of gel 
stability  divided  into  physical,  chemical,  and  thermal  stabilities, 
depending  upon  the  triggering  mechanisms  of  physical  stresses, 
chemical  incompatibility  among  the  components,  and  thermal 
stresses. Effects of the gellant concentration, properties of size dis- 
tributions of metal particles, concentrations of surfactant and sta- 
bilizing agents on gel stability were also outlined, along with the 
rheological effects created by the presence of a ﬁnite yield stress. 

Rapp and Zurawski [15] also outlined the methods useful for 
quantitative determination of these instabilities. To our knowledge, 

quantitative  determination  of  chemical  and  thermal  instabilities 
has not been reported yet and very few studies provided essen- 
tial quantitative estimates of physical stability [ 15 , 44 , 65 , 66 ]. Physi- 
cal stability of gel slurries was monitored for periods exceeding six 
months as part of the studies at NACA [ 65 , 66 ] using viscosity mea- 
surements while physical stability in the short term was quantiﬁed 
in the studies by Rapp and Zurawski [15] and Padwal and Mishra 
[44] . Long-term stability tests account for aging effects during stor- 
age and short-term (or accelerated stability) tests pertain to the 
physical stability under dynamic conditions imposed during trans- 
portation and ﬂight. 

A  column  of  exceptionally  stable  gel  propellant  is  capable  of 
supporting its own weight without slumping as shown in Fig. 10 b 
(Image 4 ). This visual indication is useful to qualitatively ascertain 
gel  stability  and  so  could  be  the  visual  inspection  of  the  sepa- 
rated liquid and solid phases. Test tube inversion gives qualitative 
information on gel stability by simply observing whether the gel 
ﬂows  under  its  own  weight  in  an  inverted  test  tube  [147] .  This 
is  a  quick  and  reliable  method  for  ﬁxing  the  minimum  concen- 
tration of gellant required for a stable gel. Varma et al. [84] used 
visual inspections for ascertaining the stability of MMH-HPMC and 
MMH-ASPAA gels in uncontrolled ambient conditions over a period 
of 15 weeks. They found that gelation prevented the vaporization 
of MMH and showed no physical deterioration in gels. However, 
aluminized MMH-HPMC gel suffered from settling of metal parti- 
cles  depending  upon  the  concentration  of  gellant  and  the  metal 
loading. A critical gellant concentration and higher metal content 
lessened  the  tendency  of  metal  particles  to  separate  to  a  maxi- 
mum extent of 10 % of the original metal loading. Perhaps more 
importantly, the remixing of the components restored the gels to 
their  initial  condition,  unlike  the  case  with  some  boron  slurries 
[60] . Remixing is however not feasible for gels that require high 
temperatures during mixing. 

Rheological measurements provide good qualitative indications 
of the gel stability because they are intimately connected with the 
structure of gels, which typically evolves over time. Gel stability 
is also related to the thixotropic nature of gels as discussed in the 
next section. Accordingly, Mallory et al. [135] characterized the sta- 
bility of 5 % HPC gel of water by measuring viscosity ( η) in a rota- 
tional rheometer. Their data are shown in Fig. 15 within the shear 
rate range typical of storage conditions. The contour maps reveal 
that  the  viscosity  slowly  increased  until  the  gelation  was  com- 
pleted, followed through a stable period during which gel showed 
no change in viscosity, and ﬁnally deterioration of the gel reduced 
its viscosity. It should be noted that the unsheared gel used for 
constructing Fig. 15 was less viscous and transparent than the im- 
age 2 in Fig. 10 a.

Stability index ( S I ), a measure of the extent of physical separation 
of liquid fuel from the gel matrix, was then estimated as the ra- 
tio of separated fuel volume ( V L ) and the original volume of gel 
sample ( V O ) and expressed as S I = ( V L / V O ) × 100 %. Smaller S I indi- 
cates better physical stability. It is a reliable measure of physical 
stability since the measurement of the separated liquid volumes is 
more accurate than the solid concentration in the volume of sep- 
arated liquid. Padwal and Mishra [44] used S I to characterize the 
gel stability under different operating conditions used during mix- 
ing and thereby to select the most favorable operating conditions 
that would yield physically most stable gel as shown in Fig. 16 b. 

Fig.  16 b  also  shows  the  improvement  in  physical  stability  as 
processing temperatures are increased for a ﬁxed gellant concen- 
tration ( Y G ) of 7.5 %. The most stable gel structure is observed at 
70 °C with negligibly small phase separation, indicating that higher 
processing temperature reduces the phase separation, presumably 
due  to  the  enhanced  activity  of  gellant  and  stronger  structural 
framework. Considering these observations, higher gellant concen- 
tration and processing temperatures reduce the phase separation 
under accelerated conditions, thus imparting more structural sta- 
bility to the gel fuels. As presented in Fig. 16 c, gels processed at 60 
and 63 °C and three gellant concentrations 6, 7.5, and 9 % showed 
that  lower  processing  temperature  and  gellant  concentration  re- 
sulted in the maximum phase separation ( ∼20 %) compared with 
the sample processed using the higher gellant concentration and 
temperature (2 %). 

The  centrifugal  acceleration  tests  performed  by  Santos  et  al. 
[71]  were  for  relatively  small  duration  (600  s)  but  covered  dis- 
turbances of still higher intensity (up to 1500 g ). Their results are 
shown in Fig. 16 d for two centrifugal strengths and RP-1 and JP-8 
gels. The fuels differ slightly in their carbon number (12 for RP- 
1 and 11 for JP-8). Their data indicate that the silica gellant con- 
centration of 7 % is required to obtain the gels of suﬃcient struc- 
tural stability. While viscosity increased with gellant concentration, 
higher amount of carbon in RP-1 resulted in higher viscosity of the 
RP-1-silica gel for a given gellant concentration and consequently 
imparted better stability [71] . 

However, considering once again the scientifc triangle for gel 
propellants [17] , the most stable gel is not useful for combustion 
because  it  cannot  be  atomized  due  to  its  unfavorable  rheologi- 
cal  characteristics.  These  issues  are  taken  up  during  the  discus- 
sion of rheological properties and atomization of gel propellants 
in Sections 4 and 5 , respectively. 

3.6. Scale effects 

Over  the  years,  formulation  studies  have  been  carried  out  at 
different scales, from 100 kg used in the gelled metal slurry fu- 
els [60]  to  small batches  at  the  kilo-scale (1.5-4  kg)  used  in Jet 
A1 [44] and water [17] gels. Batches of a few tens or hundreds of 
grams have been typically used for hazardous hypergolic fuels and 
oxidizers and for rheological studies (see Table 3 ). 

McKinney  and  Tarpley  [8]  successfully  scaled  up  the  gelation 
procedure of liquid hydrogen by pyrogenic silica from 0.5 to 2.2 
liter volume. During the scale-up, appropriate modiﬁcation in the 
method of contacting silica with the liquid hydrogen resulted in 
the same quality of the gel in terms of the fraction of silica, yield 
stress, and the vaporization ratio at the two scales, thus success- 
fully eliminating the scale effects, as shown in Fig. 17 a. 

On the other hand, the scale effects cannot always be avoided. 
Munjal et al. [12] reported such a case for the gels of hypergolic 
UDMH and RFNA with MC, A-A, and silica, respectively. As shown 
in Fig. 17 b, the gelation time increased dramatically for a relatively 
container ) used for gelation.

on 5 % HPC gel with water (adopted from data reported in Ref. [135] ). 

Above  discussion  on  the  stability  and  aging  of  gels  indicates 
that gels have a ﬁnite shelf-life dependent upon many factors. Met- 
alized gels are especially prone to the physical deterioration un- 
less care is exercised in the choice of stabilizing agents. Previous 
experience at NACA [ 65 , 66 ] on the selection of appropriate stabi- 
lizing agents for the metalized gel fuels and highly loaded metal 
slurry fuels should prove to be a useful starting point for in-depth 
characterization of gel stability during storage. Rapp and Zurawski 
[15]  have  also reported  the viscosity  measurements on  RP-1 gel 
samples immediately after formulation and after a 5-month stor- 
age time. However, the shear rates used by them are not represen- 
tative of the storage conditions. Their data are discussed further in 
Section 4.4 . 

It should be recognized that gel stability during the ﬂight con- 
ditions is also important because any separation during ﬂight could 
lead to inhomogeneity and possibility of clogging of tubes and at- 
omizer. Therefore, quantitative assessment of stability under phys- 
ical and thermal stresses is carried out in simulated static and dy- 
namic conditions. Gel stability in the simulated ﬂight conditions 
has been established by centrifugal acceleration of the propellant 
samples to a prescribed g -force for a ﬁxed duration [ 15 , 44 ]. Stabil- 
ity is then assessed by calculating the stability index, a measure of 
the extent of physical separation of propellant and/or metal addi- 
tives from the gellant matrix. 

Rapp and Zurawski [15] considered that the stability behavior 
at g values lower than 100 g will be much better and relevant in 
practice (e.g. space shuttle and missiles experience < 100 g force). 
Hence, they used 100 g as the centrifugal ﬁeld strength for testing 
the stability of Al-RP-1 gels in terms of the ratio ( C/C o ). These gels 
contained RP-1, methanol, Carbopol, and lauryl amine in the ratio 
77.6:8.6:3.5:10.3 by weight. C is the concentration of solids in the 
top 1 ml of liquid layer after subjecting the sample to centrifugal 
ﬁeld strength of 95 g for 6 hours. C o  is the concentration in the 
gel prior to centrifugal acceleration. Smaller ( C/C o ) indicates poor 
physical stability. As shown in Fig. 16 a, ( C/C o ) yielded reliable re- 
sults only up to a certain mass fraction of Al in the Al/RP-1 gels. 
It was less reliable when the physical separation was observed in 
these gels. 

Padwal  and  Mishra  [44]  employed  the  stability  testing  un- 
der accelerated dynamic conditions for characterizing the Jet A1- 
Thixatrol ST gel for different processing temperatures and gellant 
concentrations. First, the minimum gellant concentration required 
for  a  stable  Jet  A1  gel  was  identiﬁed by  the  test  tube  inversion 
method  [147] ,  rejecting  the  gellant  concentration  for  which  the 
sample ﬂowed down the tube. Then, accelerated dynamic condi- 
tions were simulated in a laboratory centrifuge operated at cen- 
trifugal ﬁeld strength of 100 g , following Rapp and Zurawski [15] .

3.7. Integrated scale-up and optimal formulation 

Considering the number of factors involved in the formulation 
of gel propellants ( Fig. 13 ), formulation procedure of a gel needs 
to be optimized to obtain the ﬁnal product of required stability, 
sprayability  (ability  to  atomize),  and  performance.  Stability  tests 
described above give a good indication of the suitable range of fac- 
tors. However, a gel propellant cannot be formulated optimally by 
testing its short or long-term stability alone. It invariably requires 
a careful selection of components and mixing conditions to obtain 
the required ﬂow characteristics so that atomization can be car- 
ried out to achieve the required spray properties. This is essential 
because the requirements of structurally stable (but too viscous to 
ﬂow) and easily sprayable (but prone to phase separation) are con- 
ﬂicting. 

Arnold et al. [72] investigated the optimal gelling process for 
JP-8  and  RP-1  fuels  using  fumed  silica  gellant.  Gel  quality  was 
assessed  with  respect  to  the  viscosity,  physical  appearance,  and 
structural  stability.  Amount  of  gellant  in  fuel  signiﬁcantly  inﬂu- 
enced the viscosity and stability of the gel fuels. They did not re- 
port any data on the sprayability of formulated gels. 

Through  their  kilo-scale  gel  propellant  formulation  studies 
aimed to yield the quantitative estimates about the useful range of 
gellant concentration and stability, Padwal and Mishra [44] showed 
that a smaller gellant concentration and lower mixing temperature 
were  the  favored  operating  conditions  for  determining  the  suit- 
ability  of  Jet  A1-Thixatrol  ST  gel  system  for  atomization.  A  cog- 
nizance of the stability and ability to spray the gel was required 
to obtain optimal formulation. The optimal gel formulation would 
be  stable  during  storage  and  be  sprayable  with  available  hard-

ware. Padwal and Mishra [44] formulated the Jet A1 gel propel- 
lant  with  this  criterion  and  have  found  that  Jet  A1  gel  formu- 
lated  using  7.5  %  Thixatrol  ST,  a  commercial  additive  for  paints, 
can be used for atomization and sustained combustion if mixed at 
63 °C. 

As suggested in Fig. 18 , a comprehensive formulation program 
for  gel  propellant  would  begin  with  the  identiﬁcation  of  mul- 
tiple  factors  that  determine  the  quality  of  gel  with  respect  to 
these constraints, many of which are listed in the diagram. A sig- 
niﬁcant  number  of  the  parameters  can  be  eliminated  based  on 
previous experience in the accumulated literature. Feasible range 
of each of the remaining parameters needs to be determined in 
the  next  step.  It  is  followed  by  an  adequate  number  of  experi- 
ments and tests designed to assess the suitability of the formu- 
lated gels and variations in the quality parameters deﬁned above 
with  respect  to  the  variables  of  formulation  procedure.  Large- 
scale formulation of gel propellant would have to satisfy the con- 
straints imposed by the required storage life, feasibility of atom- 
ization, and desired combustion performance. A "useful life" has 
been deﬁned in this regard [63] and it is the age at which set- 
tled components cannot be dispersed again. Another indication of 
the  limit  of  useful  life  [138]  is  the  threshold  viscosity  at  which 
the settling rate is rapid enough to trigger a rapid fall in viscos- 
ity  with  time.  The  quantitative  criteria  for  ensuring  the  compli- 
ance with these requirements should be drawn from all the ma- 
jor areas of gel propulsion. Accordingly, a prescribed yield stress, 
vaporization  ratio,  stability  index,  Sauter  mean  diameter,  and  a 
suitable  combustion  performance  parameter  are  the  quantitative 
constraints  that  must  be  satisﬁed  by  an  optimal  gel  propellant 
formulation. 

Scale-up factors also would form an integral part of the over- 
all formulation strategy and an eﬃcient method for the selection 
of experimental factors and data reduction needs to be evolved to 
eﬃciently handle the interaction effects associated with multiple 
factors. The list of objective functions is much more comprehensive 
than would be suggested by Fig. 18 ; Rapp and Zurawski [15] (see 
Table I in their report) mention 21 objective functions to obtain the 
desired properties for metalized gel propellants in the categories of 
formulation, stability, and rheology. 

4. Viscosity and ﬂuid behavior 

Shear in varying levels is manifested in all the processes involv- 
ing gel propellants as given in Table 4 . Typical length ( L c and d c ), 
velocity ( u c ), and time scales found in the surveyed experimental 
studies  [ 20 , 23 , 24 , 53 , 82 ]  were  used  to  estimate  the  characteristic 
time scale ( t ∗) and the corresponding shear rates ( ˙ γ ). 

Fig. 19 shows the co-variations of shear rate and characteristic 
time scales ( t ∗) of different processes typically concerned with gel 
propellant in the logarithmic coordinate space. The orders of mag- 
nitude of t ∗ were estimated using the velocity and length scales 
for a particular processes / locations. Orders of magnitude for  ˙ γ are 
based on the experimental data. The inset shows these processes 
/ locations on a simpliﬁed test rig. Storage represents the longest 
phase during which the gel is subjected to the lowest shear lev- 
els for extended times. It is followed by expulsion from the stor- 
age cylinder at a rate commensurate with the required ﬂow rate 
of propellant. Remainder of the downstream processes are much 
faster, ordinarily t ∗ < 1 s is required for ﬂow through atomizer, 
droplet transport, and combustion. The shear levels of these pro- 
cesses vary dramatically over a wide range ( ˙ γ = 10 1 -10 6 s −1 ) and 
could ﬂuctuate depending upon the piping elements. 

A gradual increase in the shear levels is expected for oriﬁces 
preceded by a tapered/converging upstream section. Obviously, the 
t ∗ values for the converging section would be bracketed by the t ∗

The most  direct way of  comparing some  aspects of  the  non- 
Newtonian rheology of gel propellants is in terms of ’ﬂow curves’ 
that  represent  the  relationship  between  shear  stress  and  shear 
rate. Fig. 20 shows ﬂow curves for two gel propellants and the liq- 
uid hydrocarbon propellants from which they were formulated. 

By deﬁnition, the ﬂow curves for Newtonian liquid propellants 
are linear and indicate a constant viscosity independent of applied 
shear rate. Flow curves for the non-Newtonian gel propellants are 
non-linear and when the apparent viscosity of ﬂuid decreases with 
increase in the shear rate, the resulting shearing stress is propor- 
tionately larger. This leads to a ﬂow curve (Jet A1-Thixatrol ST) that 
lies above the Newtonian ﬂow curve (Jet A1) as shown in Fig. 20 . 
Such non-Newtonian ﬂuids are inherently ’shear thinning’. 

Flow curves can be measured in rheometers and viscometers. A 
rheometer can measure the history of stress and deformation of a 
ﬂuid of unknown ﬂow model (or rheological constitutive equation) 
while viscometer is capable of measuring the steady shear viscos- 
ity as a function of shear rate ( ˙ γ ) [149] . The diﬃculty in building 
ﬂow curves as shown in Figs. 20 b and 20 c stems from the inability 
to measure stress ( τ ) at very low shear rates ( ˙ γ ) approaching zero, 
because of the inherent limitations in achieving very small ﬂow 
rates or rotational speeds. Hence, the curve shown for yield stress 
gel in Fig. 20 c can only be approximately correct. Comprehensive 
determination  of  the  rheological  behavior  of  a  gel  propellant  by 
means  of  ﬂow  curves  is  not  realistic  and  different  methods  are 
employed to independently measure or infer yield stress ( τ
yield ) as 
discussed in Section 4.3 . For the data shown in Fig. 20 for Jet A1- 
Thixatrol ST [28] , the τ
yield  was inferred from a ﬁtting procedure 
using a ’ﬂow model’, an issue discussed further in Section 4.6.1 . 
The MMH-HPC gel is likewise shown to have very low yield stress 
when 3 % HPC is added [150] and undetectable yield stress when 
4 % HPC is used [148] , subject to considerable uncertainty in its 
detection. 

In  Sections  4.2 - 4.5 ,  we  discuss  some  of  these  methods  with 
particular emphasis on those used commonly for gel propellants. 
Early studies relied on viscometers, while the versatile rotational 
rheometers in shear stress or shear rate controlled modes and us- 
ing cone-plate or parallel plate geometries are now being used for 
low-to-medium shear rate measurements, dynamic measurements, 
and oscillatory shear measurements. Velocity slip and mechanical 
fracture of the samples are the chief sources of errors in rheome- 
ters. High shear rates are accessible using the capillary viscome- 
ters, which are also used in shear stress or rate controlled mode. 
Capillary  end  effects  and  slip  velocity  at  the  walls  are  the  chief 
sources of errors for capillary rheometers. New methods and vari- 
ations of the existing methods can be found in the specialized lit- 
erature on rheometers and allied instruments. 

4.2. Viscosity 

Gels are exposed to different levels of shear during their life 
cycle;  ˙ γ → 0 − 10 −2 s −1  are  characteristic  of  storage  and  low  in- 
tensity  vibrations.  ˙ γ → 10 −2 − 10 3 s −1  are  reached  when  the  gel 
is loaded/unloaded and when it ﬂows through tubes and piping 
elements, and  ˙ γ ≥ 10 3 s −1  are typically reached when converging 
ﬂows are encountered, or when high-momentum transfer with an 
atomizing ﬂuid occurs near the exposed gel surface during atom- 
ization.  ˙ γ → 10 6 s −1  are  commonly  observed  during  atomization 
for a relatively short duration. Order-of-magnitude levels of shear 
rate reached at different stations in a simpliﬁed delivery system 
were discussed above with reference to Fig. 19 . For convenience, 
we arbitrarily use the terms low shear, medium shear, and high 
shear to denote shear rate levels in the respective ranges. Jejurkar 
et al. [79] have sketched a typical shear history of gels from stor- 
age station to droplet formation, according to which the actual ex-

velocity correlations are widely distributed, the vaporization time 
and combustion time scales and shear levels experienced by the 
droplets are also distributed. The estimated scales for the stages 5 
and 6 are therefore likely to be distributed in turn. Further, shear 
levels continuously increase in the converging section. 

Fig. 19 also reinforces the notion that shear is the primary vari- 
able that controls the behavior of gel propellant during entire life 
cycle through its inﬂuence on the rheological properties discussed 
in the following sections. 

4.1. Rheological properties 

The semi-solid physical state of gels gained by an appropriate 
formulation  procedure  provides  safety  since,  in  case  of  accident, 
the leakage and spreading of the propellant is limited. Gels also 
permit a stable dispersion of metal particles with long storage du- 
ration. All these characteristics are explained when the viscosity, 
yield stress, thixotropy, and viscoelasticity of gels are quantiﬁed. 
Gel propellants are thus rheologically complex non-Newtonian ﬂu- 
ids. Relevance of the properties mentioned above is summarized in 
Table 5 . 

Desirable rheological properties are a special consideration for 
gel  propellants  and  they  are  often  conﬂicting  [76] .  For  exam- 
ple, good slosh behavior, position control, and mechanical stability 
would require a high yield stress. On the other hand, low pressure 
drops in lines require low yield stress. Further, tendency to leave 
residue  on  surfaces  is  useful  to  cement  a  puncture  and  also  to 
cool exposed surfaces of atomizer and walls of combustion cham- 
ber. However, residue in manifold and oriﬁce is undesirable feature 
during restart or throttling [76] . 

We have already encountered shear thinning, yield stress, and 
thixotropy as important properties in the formulation and stabil- 
ity of gels in Section 3 . Role of viscoelasticity and indeed of the 
remaining properties will be discussed in detail in the present sec- 
tion. In particular, the deﬁnitions of these properties, measurement 
methods, experimental data accumulated so far on many gel pro- 
pellants, and theoretical and computational analyses are covered.

posure of shear and the duration vary from system to system in a 
typical gel propellant case. 

Apparent viscosity, the ratio of shearing stress and shear rate, 
is the most important and readily quantiﬁable property of gel pro- 
pellants. Gel propellants are shear thinning, i.e. their viscosity de- 
creases with increase in the applied shear rate ( ˙ γ ). In simple shear, 
apparent viscosity is also called shear viscosity ( η). 

4.2.1. Low and medium shear 

Fig. 21 shows the shear-thinning nature of a large number of 
gel propellants and their simulants, in all containing 31 datasets 
from a number of rheological measurements performed using the 
commercial rotational rheometers [ 28 , 36 , 51 , 53 , 77 , 79 , 88 , 151-154 ] in 
the range  ˙ γ = 10 −4 -10 3 s −1 . Individual gel propellants are collected 
in Fig. 21 a and multiple data for a given gel system of varying pro- 
portions of the gellant are shown as bounded regions in Fig. 21 b. 
It should be noted that variability in the different samples of nom- 
inally the same gel composition would be reﬂected in the uncer- 
tainty in the measured viscosity. 

All  proﬁles  indicate  shear  thinning  in  the  low-medium  shear 
rate range. A large variation in the shear viscosities of gels is also 
observed, with some gels being much less viscous than others at 

a given shear rate. Fig. 21 also shows that the slope of η- ˙ γ curves 
changes with the levels of shear. When the experimental condi- 
tions are carefully controlled, the variable slope indicates changes 
in the structure and the rate of shear thinning. Plateau region of 
MMH-HPC in the lower shear levels is notable among these curves 
as also the steep slopes of JP-8-silica and other gels in the same 
range. The latter type of gels are sometimes referred as extremely 
shear thinning. 

Flow curves of FNA and UDMH gels have been constructed pre- 
viously  using  viscometers  [ 13 , 14 ].  Slurry  fuels  stabilized  by  gel- 
lants have been formulated and tested for ramjet and tail-pipe type 
combustors at NACA. Studies at NACA utilized specially designed 
viscometers for understanding the effects of different soap-based 
gellants and their concentration on the dense n-decane-Mg slur- 
ries [155] and also to understand the effect of temperature on JP- 
5/B and JP-5/Mg slurries [156] stabilized by gellants. 

4.2.2. High shear 

Atomization  of  gel  propellants  leading  to  an  ensemble  of 
droplets of satisfactory size and size distribution is central to the 
sustained ignition and combustion in a spray ﬂame. Shear rates en- 
countered in atomization are very high ∼10 6 s −1 and not much is

Fig. 22 is that the high-shear plateau is almost reached for these 
gels.  Such  data  are  useful  in  ﬂow  modeling  of  the  gels  at  high 
shear rates. Dennis et al. [40] used the high-shear data of water- 
3 % HPC gel for ﬁtting Carreau-Yasuda ﬂow model and conducted 
simulations using the ﬂow model. Fineman [153] reported on the 
need to correct the apparent shear thickening of water-HPC gels at 
high shear using the Bagley correction procedure. 

4.2.3. Flow curves using in-line measurements 

Equilibrium conditions are not always reached in actual exper- 
iments and the intensity and duration for which the shear is ap- 
plied is also not known a priori . In fact, the shear rate history of 
the gels during their passage depends upon the type of piping ele- 
ments involved, ﬂow rate, and cross-sectional area. This shear rate 
history is sometimes diﬃcult to simulate in a rheometer because 
of the limitations imposed by the rheometer response time con- 
stants and also because of the wide variations in the shear rate 
and its duration (see for example Fig. 1 e in Ref. [79] ). Under these 
conditions, the measurements of viscosity in actual ﬂow conditions 
are  of  practical  signiﬁcance  for  modeling  the  rheological  behav- 
ior  of  gels.  These  measurements  have  been  performed  in  terms 
of the pressure drop and ﬂow rate data for in-line tubes of a gel 
propellant delivery system [ 52 , 53 , 77 , 79 ] or custom-made viscome- 
ters  integrated  in  the  atomizer  [157] .  Since  these  measurements 
are made on ﬂuids having undergone shear in actual conditions, 
they are also representative of the rheological state upstream of 
the propellant spray. Therefore, the dimensionless groups govern- 
ing the breakup of the gels can be predicated on the viscosities 
obtained by such measurements [ 52 , 53 , 77 , 79 , 157 ]. 

Mansour  and  Chigier  [157]  estimated  the  ’in-line’  extensional 
viscosity  by  measuring the  inlet  pressure and  ﬂow  rates  of  mo- 
bile polyacrylamide (PAA) solutions in an airblast atomizer and us- 
ing Binding’s contraction ﬂow analysis [158] . Fig. 23 a shows that 
the ﬂuid, a dilute PAA solution, is undergoing ’extension thicken- 
ing’, meaning that the extensional viscosity ( ηext ) increased with

lants obtained on capillary viscometers. 

known about the effects of viscoelasticity and thixotropy on the 
breakup  of  a  gel  propellant  and  dynamics  of  droplets.  Only  the 
measurements  of  controlled  shear  rate  or  shear  stress  capillary 
ﬂows or similar methods can simulate ﬂow conditions at such high 
shear rates. These ﬂows generate the required pressure drops and 
jet velocities in small-bore tubes. Ciezki and coworkers [ 28 , 154 ], 
Dennis et al. [40] , and Fineman [153] have reported such measure- 
ments, among others. These datasets are compiled in Fig. 22 . 

The  measurements  of  Ciezki  and  coworkers  [ 28 , 154 ]  indicate 
that gels retain their shear thinning behavior for  ˙ γ > 10 3 s −1 . More- 
over, viscosities could still be several orders of magnitude larger 
than a typical Newtonian ﬂuid like water ( η = 9 × 10 −4 Pa s at 25 
°C)  at  ˙ γ → 10 6  s −1 .  Another  observation  for  the  example  data  of 
paraﬃn particulate gels with Aerosil and Thixatrol ( (cid:4) ) shown in

and Chigier [157] processed using Binding’s contraction ﬂow analysis [158] showing ’extensional thickening’ compared against ’shear thinning’ (b) in-line tube data of

the stretch rate ( ˙ γext ). It should be understood that the ﬂuids were 
nevertheless, ’shear thinning’ in the same range of shear rates as 
shown in Fig. 23 a. 

As  shown  in  Fig.  23 b,  Padwal  and  Mishra  [53]  measured  the 
pressure drops in small-bore polyurethane tubes used for delivery 
of Jet A1-Thixatrol ST-xylene gels to the atomizer head and esti- 
mated the apparent shear viscosity upstream of the atomizer dur- 
ing  atomization  experiments.  Jejurkar  et  al.  [ 77 , 79 ]  followed  the 
same method for ISROsene-Thixatrol ST-xylene gel rocket propel- 
lants mixed with alumina nanoparticles. The scatter in data for the 
gels loaded with nano-alumina particles is due to different con- 
centrations of the particles in the 0-20 % range. The measurements 
show  that  Thixatrol  ST  gels  retained  shear  thinning  at  the  high 
shear rate ranges reached upstream of the atomizer. It is relatively 
easy to use the in-line tube method in a wider range of shear rates 
( ˙ γ = 72-4.2 × 10 4  s −1  in Fig. 23 b) by using appropriate tube size 
and pressure drop. The data reduction procedure is the same as 
the one followed in capillary viscometer measurements [53] and 
the accuracy of this method is also governed by the same error 
sources [53] . 

A similar method as used in Refs. [ 52 , 53 , 77 , 79 ] was previously 
employed by Chojnacki and Feikema [159] for water-Carbopol 941- 
NaOH (98.5:0.5:1) gel propellant simulant. Chojnacki and Feikema 
[159] used larger bore tubes, 6.35-12.5 mm in diameter and 1.8 m 
in length, downstream of the piston-cylinder assembly. The mea- 
sured pressure drops were used for the estimation of wall shear 
stress ( τ w ). A power law model was also ﬁtted using the measure- 
ments because the yield stress ( τ
yield ) was negligible for this gel 
system. Previous data on the same system as reported by Green 
et al. [127] using the rotational bob-and-cup viscometer and the 
in-line tube measurements are compiled in Fig. 23 c. 

Experimentally  determined  ﬂow  curves  (or  equivalently, 
viscosity-shear rate data) shown in Figs. 21-23 are reduced to the 
semi-empirical models of rheological behavior that are especially 
convenient  for  numerical  computations  and  theoretical  analyses. 
The most commonly used ﬂow models in gel propulsion literature 
are discussed in Section 4.6.1 . 

4.2.4. Extreme shear thinning 

Fig.  21  showed  that  silica  gels  are  more  shear  thinning  than 
the  gels  based  on  polymeric  HPC  and  HEC  gellants.  Such  rapid 
shear thinning appears to be a characteristic feature of some gels 
in which, a particulate gellant is used. Extreme shear thinning de- 
notes a faster decrease in the shear viscosity for relatively small 
increase in shear. Addition of metal particles could also induce ex- 
treme shear thinning in gels. Extreme shear thinning is indicated 
by nearly ﬂat ﬂow curves ( τ - ˙ γ ) in the low shear rate region and 
suggests that the shear viscosity of such gels decreases very rapidly 
with little change in shear stress over a signiﬁcant change in shear 
rate. Fig. 24 further illustrates this behavior for liquid oxygen di- 
ﬂuoride (OF 
3 ), a ﬂuori- 
nated oxidizer [124] in the higher shear rate range. 

2 gelled by chlorine triﬂuoride (ClF 

2 ) and N 

It is clear that multiple orders-of-magnitude increase in shear 
rate lead to a relatively less change in the shear stress but with 
orders-of-magnitude  decrease  in  shear  viscosity.  Extreme  shear 
thinning can complicate the attempts to correlate the structure or 
’strength’ of gel with its ﬂow properties [ 10 , 124 , 149 ]. Gel structure 
is typically indicative of its solid-like properties and yield stress is 
their most convenient quantitative description. It is described in 
Section 4.3 . 

Table 6 summarizes the additional data for ﬂow curves of dif- 
ferent gels, along with available shear rate ranges and the mea- 
surement methods employed.

4.2.5. Extensional viscosity 

Polymeric  gellants  are  commonly  used  in  gel  propellants 
[ 17 , 40 , 135 , 153 ].  The  resulting  propellants  are  viscoelastic  and  as 
discussed  further  in  Section  4.4 ,  many  non-polymeric  gels  also 
exhibit  viscoelasticity.  Viscoelastic  ﬂuids  tend  to  elongate  when 
stretched longitudinally and elongational ﬂows are commonly en- 
countered during atomization when the gels are passed through 
small-bore  oriﬁces  and  capillaries,  or  when  gel  fragments  (liga- 
ments and drops) undergo secondary breakup. Elongational ﬂows 
are always coupled with shear ﬂows in atomization. Consideration 
of the effects of elasticity on the viscosity of gels is thus impera- 
tive. 

Extensional (or elongational) viscosity can be measured by ex- 
tensional  rheometers,  devices  that  create  unconﬁned  extensional 
ﬂows of the sample, largely free of contamination by shear, using 
constant volume, constant length, entrance (contraction) ﬂow, op- 
posed jet, and capillary breakup methods [149] . For more informa- 
tion on these methods, the reader is directed to Ref. [149] . Man- 
sour and Chigier [157] integrated the entrance ﬂow method in the 
airblast atomizer for water-polyacrylamide (PAA) ﬂuids. Yarin et al. 
[132] used capillary extensional ﬂow along with image processing 
for water-0.3-1 % Carbopol gel. 

Fig.  23 a  showed  that  polymeric  solutions  have  tendency  to 
show  shear  thinning  and  extensional  thickening  while  undergo- 
ing  elongational  ﬂow  such  that  the  extensional  viscosity  would 
increase at the same time as the shear viscosity would decrease. 
In fact, this increased the net viscous resistance of the ﬂuids and 
these ﬂuids did not atomize [157] . The increased ﬂow resistance is 
considered to arise because of uncoiling of the polymer present in 
solution. The relative dominance of extensional viscosity over shear 
viscosity is expressed by Trouton ratio ( T R = ηext / η) that could be in 
the range 3-10 4 for PAA solutions [157] and smaller, in the range 
0.57-5.65, for a Carbopol gel [132] . 

Yarin et al. [132] used induced uniaxial stretch in a thread of 
water-Carbopol  ETD  2050  gel  propellant  simulant  ( Y G = 0.3-1  wt 
%) held between two plates. Near the pinch-off point,  ˙ γext = 10 2 - 
10 3 s −1 was reached. Using an approximate expression for tracking 
the changes in the thread diameter [132] and high-speed visual- 
ization of the elongation process, it was possible to estimate the 
consistency index ( K ) and exponent ( n ) of the power law rheolog- 
ical model. In separate experiments, the gel was also subjected to 
simple shear in a rotational rheometer ( ˙ γ = 1-100 s −1 ) and K and 
n were estimated using curve ﬁtting. The estimates using uniaxial 
stretch and simple shear are shown in Figs. 25 a and 25 b. 

While scatter in the data suggests lower accuracy of uniaxial 
stretch,  it  appears  that  the  behavior  of  water-Carbopol  gel  pro- 
pellant  simulant  during  elongation  could  be  inferred  from  sim- 
ple shear experiments [132] , as long as extensional thickening is

not signiﬁcant. Thus, for the low shear and stretch rates used by 
Yarin et al. [132] , Trouton ratio, T R = 3 using simple shear is brack- 
eted  by  the  range  T R = 0.57-5.65  indicated  by  the  generally  less 
accurate thread stretching experiments. Negri et al. [162] worked 
with the same gel system, this time using a capillary rheometer. 
Cogswell’s method was adopted to obtain ηext and hence, T R for ˙ γ = 
10 5 -2 × 10 6 s −1 . As discussed in the preceding sections, shear rates 
at this level are characteristic of the atomizer oriﬁce region just 
prior to atomization. The estimates of ηext  and T R  are shown in 
Fig. 25 c for water-1 wt % Carbopol 980 gel. Results for ethanol- 
10 wt % fumed silica are also shown for comparison. We observe 
signiﬁcant extensional thickening and corresponding rise in T R as 
the increase in ηext is accompanied by shear thinning. While com- 
parison of these estimates with another method have not been re- 
ported, it should be noted that both gels were successfully atom- 

ized using a doublet impinging jet atomizer, irrespective of the en- 
hanced elastic resistance [162] . 

The results of extensional viscosity discussed above suggest that 
it builds in proportion to the shear rate achieved during the feed- 
ing  and  injection  of  gel  propellant.  These  results  also  hint  that 
the dynamics of atomization process might also be important so 
that fast atomization could still beat the adverse effects of a sud- 
den rise in the elastic resistance at the time of atomization. The 
rheological effects on atomization of gel propellants discussed in 
Section 5.7 further elaborate this issue (see also Section 5.9.1 ). 

4.2.6. Radiation and thermal effects 

Just as kinetic (mechanical) energy is useful to reduce the vis- 
cosity of gel propellant, other forms of energy including electro- 
magnetic  (EM)  radiation  and  heat  could  also  be  used  to  obtain

[17] suggested that a hybrid gellant (combination of two gellants) 
could be used such that the temperature-dependence of viscosity 
of the resulting gel propellant could be reduced signiﬁcantly. This 
behavior is shown in Figs. 27 a and 27 b in terms of the consistency 
index ( K ) and exponent ( n ) of the Herschel-Bulkley (HB) gels. The 
additional degree of freedom provided by the relative proportion of 
the two gellants (represented by the mass fraction of ﬁrst gellant 
1 in their mixture) could also be used to tailor their other proper- 
Y 
ties. Another example of a gel propellant simulant that is relatively 
less sensitive to the changes in temperature within the usual range 
of variations is the aq. Polysaccharide gel shown in Fig. 27 c [164] . 
Hipsher [156] reported the thermal effects on the plastic and 
apparent  viscosities  of  JP-5/50-65  wt  %  B  and  JP-5/50  wt  %  Mg 
slurry propellants stabilized by glycerol sorbitan laurate (GSL) sur- 
factant and aluminum octoate (Al-O) gellant. Storage temperature 
range of 0-80 °C was investigated. Plastic and apparent viscosities 
decreased at high temperatures and it was possible to correlate the 
response  of  Mg  slurries  in  terms  of  the  relation  ln ηapp = aT + b . 
Hipsher [156] noted that the thermal effects are usually compli- 
cated by viscous aging of the gel propellant 

Rahimi et al. [88] have reported that the consistency index ( K ) 
of  a  water-Carbopol  gel  did  not  decrease  signiﬁcantly  at  higher 
temperature when ﬂow curves obtained at constant temperatures 
were compared. Rahimi et al. [88] also investigated the thermo- 
rheological behavior of water-Carbopol gel simulant by following a 
prescribed program of temperature variations at a constant shear 
rate.  Their  measurements  reﬂect  the  known  dependence  of  the 
gel simulant on temperature in the high-viscosity region. The re- 
lationship  between η and  T  is  however  noted  to  be  affected  by 
thixotropic effects. In fact, thermal effects are known to propagate 
to other rheological properties including yield stress, viscoelastic- 
ity, and thixotropy, as discussed in the following sections. 

4.3. Yield stress 

Yield stress ( τ

yield ), the critical stress above which a shear thin- 
ning ﬂuid starts to ﬂow, is a critical property of gels in the pres- 
ence of vibrations, acceleration, and perturbations under end-use 
conditions. As discussed in Section 5.7 , it is also a ’ﬁlter’ for the 
low amplitude perturbations during breakup and atomization. Ex- 
istence  of  yield  stress  enables  the  dispersion  of  metal  particles 
with almost no sedimentation, thus possibly increasing both the 
propellant energetic potential and energy density. 

Yield stress is not necessarily unique since it depends upon the 
measurement (observation) time [165] and the choice of observa- 
tion time should be often appropriately related to the characteris- 
tic time of the ﬂow process or application where the results are to 
be employed. By far, the most intuitive predictions of yield stress 
could be realized by interpreting it as the critical shear stress value 
at which the material begins to ﬂow. Accordingly, minimum capil- 
lary pressure drop to initiate ﬂow [85] , maximum torque required 
to rotate a rotor [ 124 , 126 ], or instruments such as cone penetrom- 
eter and rising sphere rheometer [124] have been used to estimate 
the yield stress. In addition, several rheometric procedures are also 
available for the estimation of yield stress as mentioned in Table 7 . 
Data in Table 7 show that the estimated yield stress values are 
generally very small in comparison to the pressure drops required 
to obtain self-sustained combustion at the engine conditions. These 
measurements as such serve only to mention that the tested gels 
are yield-stress ﬂuids, and the yield stress values are typically only 
meaningful when conditions relevant to the storage of gel propel- 
lants are present. 

Four rheometric procedures used to estimate the τ

yield data re- 
ported in Table 7  are sketched  in Fig. 28 .  Figs. 28a-28c indicate 
a monotonous decrease in viscosity after the yield point. Fig. 28 d 
shows the strain response on removal of a constant shear stress 

Fig. 26.  Decrease in the apparent viscosity of metalized slurry propellant of n- 
decane stabilized by polyoxyethylene sorbitol tetraoleate (A132) due to rise in tem- 
perature by ∼80 K [155] . 

viscosity reduction. Thus, effects of electromagnetic radiation and 
heat should also attract our attention. 

Electromagnetic radiation or heating to the gel propellant can 
be  imparted  in  storage  tanks,  supply  tubes,  and  atomizer  [78] . 
Choice of a viscosity reduction method depends on the chemical 
properties  of  the  gellant  and  liquid  propellant  [78] .  Ciezki  et  al. 
[78] suggest EM radiation of a frequency (for example, microwave 
range  1-30  GHz)  selected  to  break  the  bonds  in  the  skeleton  of 
gel propellant or direct/indirect heating of the gel for reducing the 
viscosity. Various scenarios for implementing such an arrangement 
are also described. 

In general, viscosity  of  liquids is a  strong  inverse function  of 
temperature. In the case of gel propellants, this dependence is re- 
tained and complicated further by their physicochemical character- 
istics, skeletal structure, liquid propellant-gellant as well as gellant- 
gellant interactions, etc. Temperature of the stored gel propellant 
is an important factor in its stability and could adversely affect the 
stability even while within the usual range, as already described 
in Section 2.2 (see Fig. 4 c 2 ). The stability of gels is impaired due 
to the decrease in apparent viscosity with increase in temperature, 
as shown in Fig. 26 for the n-decane-50 % Mg slurry propellant 
stabilized  by  poly  oxyethylene  sorbitol  tetra  oleate  (A132)  [155] . 
For a given storage temperature, the increase in viscosity of metal- 
ized slurry propellant over n-decane is due to the incorporation of 
metal powder. However, 67 % decrease in ηapp was observed in the 
metalized propellant stabilized by 0.2 % A132 for about 80 degrees 
rise in the temperature. Further, it should be noted that interpre- 
tation of thermal effects is also inﬂuenced by their inﬂuence on all 
rheological properties of the gel propellants as discussed in subse- 
quent sections. 

The effects are further complicated by other extraneous factors 
such as chemical structure of the stabilizing agent [ 155 , 163 ] and 
concentration [155] . On one hand, a reduced viscosity could mean 
the loss of stability and structure of the gel propellant, it should be 
noted that a dramatic increase in the apparent viscosity as tem- 
perature  decreases  causes  additional  diﬃculties  during  handling. 
A  moderately  temperature-dependent  viscosity  of  gel  propellant 
is desirable because the gel propellant could then respond favor- 
ably to thermal cycles; slow loss of stability or relatively moderate 
rise in viscosity. Such a tailored response could also permit use of 
various proposed heating methods so that the propellant is easily 
forced through the delivery and injection system [163] . Pour-point 
depressants or viscosity-index improvers have also been suggested 
to lessen the effect of temperatures on apparent viscosity of gel 
propellants [163] . 

In  a  variation  of  above  strategy  for  controlling  the  thermal 
effects  on  the  rheology  of  gel  propellants,  Rahimi  and  Natan

removed.  The  stress  response  is  continuously  recorded.  Fig.  28 e 
suggests that the residual stress after the removal of a constant 
shear  rate  is  indicative  of  the  yield  stress  [133] .  Care  should  be 
taken to interpret the stress level reached at the ﬁrst decay time 
signiﬁed by a sudden drop in the shear stress proﬁle as shown in 
Fig. 28 e as the latter decrease in stress could be due to thixotropy 
or procedural issues [133] . 

Creep  experiments  are  conducted  at  small  levels  of  shear 
stresses, in the so called controlled stress (CS) mode [ 88 , 166 ], and 
the difference in the behavior of ﬂuid before and after the yield 
point is used to obtain a range of shear stress values bracketing 
the actual τ
yield (see Table 2 , Ref. [88] ). To qualify as abrupt change, 
the non-linear portion of the γ (or ˙ γ )- τ in Fig. 28 a should be iden- 
tiﬁed properly, for example using the deviation from straight-line 
segment as done by Dennis et al. [150] . The difference between 
gradual  and  abrupt  change  should  also  be  clearly  identiﬁed,  as 
seen from Fig. 6 in Ref. [135] and Fig. 3 in Ref. [148] . Further, the 
extent of linear region is uncertain and large deviations in yield 
values were observed [150] , leading to physically unrealistic esti- 
mates. Hence, the data shown in Fig. 28 a should be carefully inter- 
preted. 

Indirect  estimates  of  the  yield  stress  are  obtained  using  the 
curve ﬁtting procedures to ﬂow models in which the yield stress 
is  one  of  the  adjustable  parameters.  For  this  purpose,  Casson 
[ 13 , 14 , 161 ], HB [ 51 , 88 , 161 ], HBE [ 36 , 154 ], or Bingham [161] mod- 
els have been used. These models are described in Section 4.6.1 . 
The trends in yield stress values obtained using the ﬂow models 
are discussed now with reference to Figs. 29 and 30 . 

Madlener et al. [169] have investigated the effects of metal par- 
ticle sizes on the yield stress of Jet A1 Thixatrol ST-MIAK gel pro- 
pellants  in  which,  7.5  wt  %  gellant  Thixatrol  ST  was  used  along 
with  the  same  proportion  of  solvent  MIAK.  The  gel  propellants 
were  formulated  using  different  metal  loadings  ( Y M )  and  parti-

ilar  form  are  obtained  in  stress  relaxation  experiments  [133] ,  in 
which a constant shear rate is applied for a ﬁxed duration and then

[51] .  Yield  stress  increased  with  the  gellant  concentration  for  a 
given metal concentration and it also increased with increase in 
the metal concentration before tapering off. It would appear that 
particles do not enhance the yield value after a critical concentra- 
tion. Baek and Kim [51] suggest that this could be due to the in- 
creased bonding between the particles and polymer and concomi- 
tant decrease in the polymer-polymer bonds, leading to a decrease 
in the storage modulus, an indicator of elasticity in the structure. 
Reduced elasticity would make the shear thinning easier. 

In  the  previous  sections,  the  role  of  aq.  NaOH  in  accelerat- 
ing the gelation of Carbopol based gel simulants has been men- 
tioned  [ 1 , 51 , 126 , 127 ].  Tri  ethanol  amine  (TEA)  is  also  useful  in 
neutralization of these gels [ 51 , 161 ] and both agents behave sim- 
ilarly [51] , i.e. by uncoiling the tightly knotted chains of hydrated 
Carbopol molecules. Once uncoiled, the chains swell and gelation 
is accelerated. The uncoiling is considered to happen due to re- 
pulsion between neighboring negatively charged groups [51] and 
the  desirable  p H  range  for  this  purpose  is  6-10  [51] .  Kim  et  al. 
[161] estimated the yield stress values for the non-neutralized and 
neutralized  Carbopol  chains  using  TEA.  They  used  HB  and  Bing- 
ham  models  to  estimate  the  τ
yield  and  their  data  are  shown  in 
Fig.  30 b.  Predictions  of  the  simple  Bingham  ﬂow  model  suggest 
that higher concentrations of TEA also delayed the yielding of a 
water-Carbopol941  gel  due  to  better  gelation  and  higher  viscos- 
ity. The ability of the TEA agent to increase the yield stress value 
also increased proportionately for higher Y G . However, predictions 
of the more rigorous HB model did not show the same trends for 
reasons discussed in Section 4.6.1 . 

Fig.  30 c  shows  the  variability  in  the  estimated  yield  stresses 
from  multiple  methods  on  the  water-Carbopol  gel  system  by 
Rahimi et al. [88] in the somewhat higher concentration range of 
gellant ( Y G = 0.3-1 %) than used by Baek and Kim ( Y G = 0.25-0.35

cles of sizes in the range D 32 = 0.76-84.75 μm obtained from three 
different  sources.  Al  powders  of  D 32  >  84.75  μm  could  not  be 
handled reliably by the rheometer. Rotational rheometry, followed 
by curve ﬁtting using the extended Herschel-Bulkley (HBE) model 
gave the τ
yield  estimates shown in Fig. 29 . Flow models are dis- 
cussed  in  Section  4.6.1 .  The  increase  in τ
yield  with  Y M  is  clearly 
observed and the variations in the data induced by using differ- 
ent particle sizes and sources are also evident. The trends in τ
yield 
with D 32 of the powders are not in a particular order and greatly 
masked by the variability of concentration, strength of gels, and 
their microstructure.

tration of SUS304 (steel) nanoparticles in the concentration range

%) [51] . The yield stress continued to increase almost linearly with 
the gellant concentration. In combination, data in Figs. 30 a and 30 c 
suggest that a higher gellant concentration is expected to sustain a 
higher metal loading by substantially delaying the yielding of net- 
work. 

Yield  stress  data  in  arbitrary  units  (a.u.)  obtained  from  Cas- 
son plots of the Brookﬁeld viscometer measurements are shown 
in Fig. 30 d. At a ﬁxed concentration of the gellant, the yield stress 
generally increased on increasing the metal concentration, proba- 
bly because the higher volume fraction resulted in better cohesion 
and enhanced resistance to ﬂow [14] . The smaller particle size ( D p ) 
of Al was more effective in delaying the yielding in comparison to 
Mg. The ability of metal particles to delay the yield seems to be 
limited similarly to the SUS304 nanoparticles in Fig. 30 a. It is likely 
that the tapered off yield stress after approx. Y M = 5 % in Fig. 30 d 
could have also been caused by a similar reduction in the polymer- 
polymer bonds as noted previously in case of Fig. 30 a. 

A striking feature of the data presented in Fig. 30 is the appar- 
ent variability in the yield stress data for the same system (water- 
Carbopol). Water-Carbopol is an extensively used gel system as a 
gel propellant simulant [ 51 , 88 , 126 , 127 , 133 , 161 , 166 ]. As many fac- 
tors are involved, Fig. 31 was constructed to show the scatter in 
the data in the gellant concentration levels Y G = 0.1-4 %. We ﬁnd 
that τ
yield is also affected by the type of equation used in curve- 
ﬁtting, neutralizing agent, and slip velocity, in addition to the con- 
centration and size of metal particles. 

It is easily noticed that the yield point is delayed on increasing 
the Carbopol concentration, although the scatter is signiﬁcant. As 
shown in Fig. 31 a, close correspondence is found among the data 
obtained on the same system using direct measurements (such as 
the response at low levels of shear stress [88] ) and HB model pre- 
dictions. However, HB model predictions are generally signiﬁcantly 
lower when compared to the Bingham model [161] in other cases. 
Comparison between the non-neutralized and neutralized gel sys- 
tems in Fig. 31 b also suggests that the use of neutralizing agents 
does  not  always  delay  the  yield  point.  It  appears  that  the  yield 
stress  data  of  gel  propellants  and  their  simulants  are  subject  to 
variability in the method. Hence, deﬁnitive conclusions regarding 
the  shear  stress  levels  reached  in  water-Carbopol  gel  propellant 
simulant cannot be drawn. Coussot’s review can be consulted for 
many aspects of yield stress [170] . 

Rahimi and Weihs [166] have conducted creep-recovery tests on 
water-0.3 % Carbopol gel for a range of input shear stress ( τ 0 ). The 
recovery strain and steady shear rates increase suddenly near the 
yield stress as discussed in the next section. 

Hipsher’s results [156] on the effects of storage temperature on 
the yield stress of a JP-5/Mg slurry propellant are shown in Fig. 32 .

sistent decrease in the yield stress was observed even though the 
compositional  variability  of  the  two  batches  is  clearly  visible  in 
Fig. 32 . Thus, batch 2 of the same slurry propellant would have 
been less useful below 273 K due to the unacceptably high yield 
stress imposing severe requirements on the feeding and pumping 
systems [156] . 

Varghese et al. [93] have also reported thermal effects on the 
yield values of multiple gels of UDMH. However, their data sug- 
gests inconsistent effects. 

4.4. Viscoelasticity 

Viscoelasticity refers to the relative contribution of viscous and 
elastic components in the overall rheological behavior of gels, sep- 
arated between purely elastic and purely viscous at the yield point. 
Due to the viscoelastic nature of gel propellants, leakage or spill is 
less likely during feeding, storage, or transportation, provided the 
yield point is not reached. Response of a viscoelastic gel at a given 
applied stress below the yield point indicates the possibility of par- 
tial/full recovery of the material when the stress ceases. Table 8 
summarizes the selected studies in which the viscoelastic proper- 
ties of gel propellants and their simulants have been characterized. 
The relative strengths of viscous and elastic branches are indicated 
by loss ( G" ) and storage ( G’ ) moduli, respectively. Loss modulus in- 
dicates that the energy required for starting the ﬂow is irreversibly 
lost by shear induced heat dissipation. Storage modulus indicates 
the ability to store energy due to stress. The moduli are expressed 
by the following set of equations. δ is the phase shift angle.

Fig. 33.  Measurement of viscoelastic characteristics of gels. 

Table 8 shows that the classiﬁcation of gels into viscoelastic liq- 
uids, viscoelastic solids, or elastic solids is an important function of 
the viscoelasticity measurements. Moreover, they could also reveal 
the suitable operating conditions, concentration levels ( Y G and Y M ), 
and the type of gellant. 

As shown in Fig. 33 , creep-recovery and oscillatory shear are 
the two dynamic rheological experiments for the characterization 
of viscoelasticity. Prior to the application of dynamic rheological 
procedures on a gel, the linear viscoelastic (LVE) region is deter- 
mined by performing an amplitude sweep test. The stress ampli- 

tude is gradually increased and the covariation between the stress 
amplitude and storage modulus ( G’ ) is monitored as in Fig. 33 a. 

The linear portion of this relationship indicates the region in 
which  linear  viscoelastic  characteristics  could  be  assumed.  Low- 
frequency  strain  mimics  the  storage  conditions,  whereas,  higher 
frequencies  provide  relevant  information  for  faster  conditions, 
mainly the delivery of gel propellant. Still faster processes involv- 
ing ﬂow through injector oriﬁces, breakup, and atomization are not 
covered  by  the  LVE  region  and  cannot  be  readily  simulated,  ex- 
cept perhaps by large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) measure- 
ments. Creep (and recovery) experiments provide information on

the viscoelastic nature and additionally also indicate the approxi- 
mate value of yield stress from the creep response of material un- 
der a prolonged steady shear stress [149] . In a creep experiment, a 
constant shear stress is applied for a ﬁxed duration and the result- 
ing creep increases with time [149] . The results can be plotted as 
shown in Fig. 33 b. The shear compliance is the ratio of deforma- 
tion, γ ( t ) and applied shear stress, τ 0 ( C = γ (t) / τ0 ). 

In  addition  to  the  creep-recovery  tests,  oscillatory  measure- 
ments provide valuable information on the viscoelasticity and re- 
sponse of the material at time scales pertaining to the actual pro- 
cesses. Their application rests on the observation that the response 
of ﬂuid shear stress to the oscillatory forcing function of shear is 
also  oscillatory  and  out-of-phase  if  the  imposed  strain  is  within 
the LVE region ( Fig. 33 c). Response of a gel under low strain at dif- 
ferent frequencies is determined in terms of storage modulus ( G (cid:3) , 
elastic component) and loss modulus ( G (cid:3) (cid:3) , viscous component) by 
applying an oscillatory sinusoidal shear deformation in the LVE re- 
gion [149] . Typical resulting curves are presented in Fig. 33 c. The 
trends  shown  in  Fig.  33 c  for G (cid:3) , G (cid:3) (cid:3) ,  and  phase  angle  ( δ)  depend 
strongly upon the properties of gel and variations would be evi- 
dent in Figs. 34-37 . Further, the data can be reduced variously to 
obtain useful indicators for the behavior of gel, some of which are 
discussed here. Selected studies are now analyzed with reference 
to the remarks made in Table 8 and the data collected using the 
measurement methods described in Fig. 33 . 

Fig. 34 compiles the creep responses of water-Carbopol 934-TEA 

gels [51] . In Fig. 34 a, the typical responses below yield stress ( τ
yield 
≈ 1 Pa) are clearly distinguished from the response just above the 
yield point (imposed stress τ 0 = 1.07 Pa). The gel begins to ﬂow 
without recovering its structure once the yield point is crossed ( (cid:3)). 
Effect of the metal particle fraction ( Y M ) on the creep response 
is  presented  in  Figs.  34 b  and  28 c.  The  sudden  decrease  in  the 
recovery  strain  ( γ r )  shown  in  these  ﬁgures  is  reﬂected  in  the 
increased  storage  modulus  and  thereby,  an  enhancement  in  the 

reformation  of  structure  when  the  imposed  stress  ( τ 0 )  is  be- 
low  the  yield  point  ( τ
yield = 2.65  Pa  for  Y M = 0  and  Y G = 0.35 
%,  see  Fig.  31 a).  These  results  indicate  that  the  metalized  gels 
can  show  similar  viscoelastic  behavior  as  that  of  unmetalized 
gels. 

Rahimi et al. [88] classiﬁed the JP-5-AO gels (2 and 5 %) as vis- 
coelastic solids/liquids based on their creep response as shown in 
Fig. 35 a and after ﬁtting Burger’s mechanical model. They also in- 
dicate  that  the  same  classiﬁcation  applies  to  Carbopol  gels.  This 
classiﬁcation is based on the particular features of the creep re- 
sponse discussed in detail in Section 4.8.1 . 

Fig. 35 b gives a simpler classiﬁcation of water-1 % Carbopol 941 
gel as a Maxwell ﬂuid. This is inferred because the oscillatory shear 
data for G’ and G" suggests that the gel behaves as an elastic ma- 
terial below a critical stress ( G’ > G" ) and shows the characteristics 
of a viscous Newtonian above the critical stress ( G" > G’ ). 

Fig. 35 c shows the phase angle data for MMH gels [150] as well 
as  water  gels  [134] .  Dennis  et  al.  [150]  classiﬁed  the  MMH  gels 
with HPC as viscoelastic liquids based on their high phase angle 
( δ ≈ 20 o ) and low yield stress (see Table 7 ) in comparison to the 
Aerosil gel ( δ ≈ 5 o ). On similar lines, water-A-A gel [134] can be 
classiﬁed as viscoelastic liquid based on high phase angle ( δ ≈ 20 o ) 
shown in Fig. 35 c. However, its creep response shows the charac- 
teristics of a viscoelastic solid and Maxwell ﬂuid. A-A gels of MMH 
(1 % A-A) [171] and water (2 % A-A) [134] show similar creep re- 
sponse independent of frequency. 

Fig. 35 d shows that when the yield stress is clearly identiﬁed 
as a transition point to ﬂow, the steady shear parameter ( ˙ γ∞ ) and 
the recovery parameter ( γ r ) extracted from the creep response to 
an  imposed  shear  stress  ( τ 0 )  show  a  sharp  rise.  This  feature  of 
some  gels  is  discussed  further  in  relation  to  the  validity  of  the 
yield stress concept. 
Validity  of  the  τ

yield  data  should  be  considered  carefully  be- 
cause they are inﬂuenced by the viscoelastic behavior of gels. Data

of Rahimi et al. [88] and Dennis et al. [150] can be used to demon- 
strate two such examples. Rahimi et al. [88] questioned the validity 
of τ
yield concept for JP-5-AO gels by comparing  ˙ γ∞ of the Burger 
model with water-Carbopol gel. Their data are shown in Fig. 36 . 

They found that the water-Carbopol gels showed a sharp rise 
in  ˙ γ∞ after a region in which the yield stress was obtained inde- 
pendently. This region is highlighted in Fig. 36 a and the data from 
a  companion  study  by  Rahimi  and  Weihs  [166]  are  also  shown 
for comparison. JP-5-AO gels did not exhibit a sharp rise in  ˙ γ∞ as 
shown in Fig. 36 b. Thus, even with the viscoelastic solid/liquids, 
the yield point is not always distinguished as a well-deﬁned tran- 
sition  to  ﬂow.  It  should  be  noted  here  that  the  water-1%  Car- 
bopol  gel  shown  in  Fig.  36 a  ( (cid:3))  is  also  classiﬁed  as  viscoelastic 
solid/liquid by Rahimi et al. [88] . Inherently high phase angles ( δ), 
reﬂected in small G’ and low τ
yield , led Dennis et al. [150] to clas- 
sify the HPC and HPC-Aerosil gels as viscoelastic liquids ( Fig. 35 c) 

and  also  to  question  the  validity  of  their  τ
gels.

Fig.  37  compiles  the  effects  of  operating  conditions  used  in 
the  formulation  of  gels  on  the  viscoelastic  properties  of  gels.  In 
Fig. 37 a, the increase in metal fraction led to a sudden decrease 
in G’ in the non-linear region of the curves typically observed af- 
ter  the yield stress.  This behavior occurred  once the yield point 
was  crossed  and  is  indicative  of  the  tendency  of  metalized  Car- 
bopol gels to turn brittle. The brittleness of gels is considered to be 
caused by the increasing presence of metal particles on the walls 
of the gel and decrease in the polymer-polymer bonding that im- 
parts elasticity to the gel [51] . SEM images of the gels at increas- 
ingly higher metal fraction also support this observation. It will be 
noted that the response of the gels in the LVE region, i.e. G’ inde- 
pendent of the applied stress, is typical of the one expected from 
gel propellants suitable for atomization.

and G (cid:3) (cid:3) 

Another indication of the effect of gellant type on the viscoelas- 
tic behavior if gels is given by Fig. 37 b for MMH-HPC and MMH- 
Cekol  gels,  both  of  which  are  polymeric  gellants  showing  a  dis- 
tinctly frequency-dependent G’ . Atomization of such gels is consid- 
ered in Section 5 . 

An important connection between the formulation and subse- 
quent  rheological  behavior  is  established  by  the  data  shown  in 
Fig. 37 c in which, the effect of concentration of a non-polymeric 
gellant on the viscoelasticity parameters is demonstrated. Increas- 
ing the gellant concentration leads to a frequency-dependent G’ . 
This indicates that the elastic properties of the gels would domi- 
nate at higher frequencies that are typically accessible during ﬂow 
of the gel. Similar effect of the processing temperature is demon- 
strated  in  Fig.  37 d  for  the  same  gel  system.  Figs.  37 c  and  37 d 
show that a higher gellant concentration and processing temper- 
ature lead to stronger gels but also result in the enhanced expres- 
sion of elastic component in the frequency range characteristic of 
ﬂow conditions in the delivery system. 

Magnitudes of the storage modulus ( G’ ) in the LVE region de- 
note the relative strengths of gels. In this respect, Jet A1-Thixatrol 
ST-xylene gels are inherently stronger than other gels for which G’ 
is known in the LVE region. Moreover, they are extremely shear 
thinning (see Fig. 21 a). Atomization of the gels for which the de- 
tailed rheological data are known is considered in Section 5 . 

Viscoelasticity effects under the high frequency conditions char- 
acterizing the time scales of processes occurring during atomiza- 
tion have not been reported for gel propellants, although progress 
has been made in this area in case of polymeric ﬂuids [172] . These 
studies assume importance because the viscoelastic effects domi- 
nate at low shear viscosities reached after the high shear imparted 
at the atomizer exit, as seen previously in Fig. 23 . 

Baek and coworkers [ 129 , 130 ] recently reported viscoelasticity 
and other rheological measurements of ethanol gels based on or- 
ganic polymeric gellants (HPMC and MC). 

While  the  effects  of  temperature  variations  could  be  impor- 
tant for viscoelastic behavior of gel propellants, to the best of our 
knowledge, investigations focusing on these effects and dynamic 
behavior of viscoelasticity parameters ( G’, G" , and tan δ) have not 
been undertaken for gel propellants. 

4.5. Thixotropy 

Deﬁnition  of  thixotropy  has  undergone  many  revisions  in  lit- 
erature and is still used in different contexts, as described by te 
Nijenhuis et al. [149] . In the most comprehensive sense, thixotropy 
should be essentially viewed as a time-dependent characteristic of 
the gel propellants. It is exhibited due to the structural changes 
at the micro scale and observed in many rheological effects [149] , 
including viscosity, storage modulus, and yield stress [88] . te Ni- 
jenhuis et al. [149] also explain the relationship between extreme 
shear thinning and thixotropy, another complicating factor in the 
comprehensive characterization of the ﬂow behavior of gel propel- 
lants that has not been addressed yet. 

Table 9 summarizes the available data on thixotropy of gel pro- 
pellants and their simulants and the subsequent description elab- 
orates on the ﬁndings so far with the help of additional studies. 

One  effect  of  thixotropy  is  the  decrease  in  shear  viscosity 
with  time  when  a  constant  shear  rate  is  applied,  as  shown  in 
Fig. 38 a for  ˙ γ = 10 −3 s −1 characteristic of storage conditions. A long 
time is required to decrease the viscosity marginally in this case. 
Thixotropy manifested in Fig. 38 a is relevant for slow processes as 
in long-term storage of gel propellants in which, the structural sta- 
bility deteriorates over time (see Fig. 19 ). It is also relevant for es- 
tablishing the equilibrium ﬂow curves of thixotropic gel systems 
by preshearing them to reduce the effects of shear history. When 
the shear viscosity reaches a steady state, the equilibrium between 
structural breakdown and rebuilding is indicated.

Fig. 38.  Some aspects of thixotropy observed in gel propellants (a) preshearing time is required for thixotropic gels [79] but not for purely shear thinning gels [101] , (b) 
time-dependent shear viscosities of two gels [88] , and (c) thixotropic effects at high shear revealed by qualitative loop tests [13] . 

A  purely  shear  thinning  gel  such  as  water-3  %  Xanthan  gum 
[101]  will  not  require  preshearing  as  its  shear  viscosity  is  inde- 
pendent  of  time  at  a  given  shear  rate.  However,  in  another  pa- 
per [173] , water-2 % Xanthan gum is shown to be thixotropic. Few 
other examples can be cited for the neutralized water-Carbopol 0.3 
% [173] and water-0.35 % Carbopol 934 [51] . Further, JP-10 gel com- 
posed  of  D-gluconic  acetal  supermolecules  is  claimed  to  recover 
instantaneously upon cessation of shear [167] , which means that 
it  is  also  purely  shear  thinning.  Fig.  38 b  shows  that  thixotropy 
in this sense differs in gels, being insigniﬁcant in water-Carbopol 
gel  in  comparison  to  JP-8-silica  gel  [88] ,  as  shown  in  Fig.  38 b 
for  ˙ γ = 10 2  s −1  typically  reached  in  tubes,  and  hence,  indicative 

of  the  gels  ﬂowing  at  constant  shear  levels  for  some  duration 
( Fig. 19 ). 

Since  the  time  scales  of  ﬂow  stage  of  the  gels  given  in 
Fig. 19 are small in comparison to the time required for viscos- 
ity reduction in Figs. 38 a and 38 b, thixotropy is marginally use- 
ful  property  in  the  ease  of  ﬂow  and  atomization  of  gel  propel- 
lants.  It  is  not  advantageous for  storage due  to  the  concomitant 
deterioration of stability as also seen previously in Fig. 4 b. In the 
cases shown in Figs. 38 a and 38 b, the difference between the shear 
stresses at the gel and sol state indicates the relative magnitude of 
thixotropy.  Still  another way  to  test  the  thixotropic effects  is  by 
programming the application of shear [ 100 , 101 , 168 , 174 ].

Fig. 39.  Results of parametric investigations on the thixotropic behavior of gel propellants and their simulants, (a) effect of Mg metal concentration [14] , (b) effects of Y G 
and temperature [88] , and (c) the unphysical power law exponent ( n ) in thixotropic silica gel when the shear history is not removed by preshearing [150] . 

Loop  tests  have  been  used  for  many  gels  such  as  FNA-SS 
[13] , UDMH-MC [14] , water-Carbopol [88] , JP-8-fumed silica [101] , 
and  ethanol-MC  [174] ,  among  others.  On  the  other  hand,  non- 
thixotropic behavior of water-Carbopol-TEA gels has also been con- 
ﬁrmed by Baek and Kim [51] using the loop tests up to Y G = 0.35 
%. The data are alternatively represented in terms of η- ˙ γ [ 100 , 101 ]. 
Loop test qualitatively indicates the extent of thixotropy in terms 
of  the  area  enclosed  by  the  ’up’  and  ’down’  curves,  larger  area 
corresponding  to  more  pronounced  thixotropy.  Thixotropy  might 
also  manifest  rather  feebly  in  the  higher  shear  rate  range,  as 
known from the loop tests on highly sheared samples ( ˙ γ = 10 5 s −1 ) 
in  Fig.  38 c.  It  shows  the  results  for  FNA-SS  gels  [13]  in  which, 
the  ﬂow  curves  are  traced  by  shear  stress  ramp  up-ramp  down 
measurements.  Unsheared  sample  is  more  thixotropic  than  the 
sheared sample and shearing has almost obliterated the traces of 
thixotropic behavior. Shear rates as high as 10 5  s −1  are encoun- 
tered  in  atomization  for  a  very  small  duration  (see  Fig.  19 )  and 
thixotropy is not likely to be very signiﬁcant in atomization. 

Some studies have considered the effects of different parame- 
ters used in the formulation of gel propellants on the thixotropic 
behavior of resulting gels [ 14 , 88 , 150 ]. Loop tests shown in Fig. 39 a 
in  terms  of  η- ˙ γ reveal  that  UDMH-MC  gels  would  be  more 
thixotropic if the metal fraction is increased, apparently due to the 
slower recovery of metalized gels [14] . Loop tests also revealed a 
reduced  thixotropic  tendency  of  UDMH-MC  gels  if  the  tempera- 
ture was increased. Hipsher [156] noted that higher storage tem- 
peratures reduced the degree of thixotropy in JP-5/B-Al-O gel pro- 
pellants. Fig. 39 b gives another example of the effect of temper- 
ature and gellant concentration on thixotropy, this time in terms 
of τ - ˙ γ , according to which, the smaller Carbopol concentration or 
higher temperature reduce the thixotropy. It will be noted that Car- 
bopol up to 0.35 % is also reported to show little or no thixotropy 
[ 51 , 173 ]. Further, thixotropic effects also appear when the viscosity 
of a gel propellant varies in response to the changes in temper- 

ature [88] . Generally, thixotropic effect is more signiﬁcant at low 
temperature, as observed qualitatively from Fig. 39 b in terms of a 
smaller enclosed area of the thixotropic loop at 60 °C in compari- 
son to 0 °C. 

Preshearing  is  an  essential  ﬁrst  step  for  measuring  the  shear 
viscosity of thixotropic gels. Preshearing times can be determined 
from η- t proﬁles for ﬁxed shear rates at small enough shear rates 
and  noting  the  time  required  to  asymptotically  reach  the  equi- 
librium shear viscosity. This time would be considerably long for 
small  shear  rates  and  relatively  small  for  large  shear  rates,  for 
example Padwal and Mishra [53] required 150 s  of pre-shearing 
for  Jet  A-Thixatrol  ST-xylene  gels,  and  in  other  tests,  800  s  are 
required  for  erasing  the  shear  history  of  thixotropic  ISROsene- 
3  gels  ( ● in  Fig.  38 a)  [79] .  On  the 
Thixatrol  ST -xylene-nano  Al 
other hand, Baek and Kim [51] did not preshear the water-Carbopol 
gel  simulant  because  the  loop  tests  did  not  reveal  any  appre- 
ciable  thixotropic  behavior  for  the  highest  gellant  concentration 
(0.35 %). 

2 O 

Preshearing is also important in establishing the correct theo- 
retical models of ﬂow (’ﬂow curve ﬁtting’). Kubal [152] and Dennis 
et al. [150] revealed the differences to be expected in the behav- 
ior of gels that were used in the rheological measurements, with 
or without preshearing. Dennis et al. [150] concluded that negative 
power law exponents of non-presheared MMH-Aerosil® gels could 
be attributed to their thixotropic nature and repeated shear rate 
ramping on the lines of loop tests was necessary before repeatable 
and positive power law exponents could be obtained, as illustrated 
in Fig. 39 c. It also reveals why the presence of thixotropy should 
be checked before establishing the ﬂow curves of a gel. Accord- 
ingly, if any one of the available tests detects thixotropy, the sam- 
ple should be presheared prior to the ﬂow curve measurements 
so that the ﬁtted ﬂow models predict physically meaningful data 
that could also be replicated. In the case of Fig. 39 c, a fresh sam- 
ple of MMH-Aerosil gave erroneous power law exponent ( n < 0)

Thixotropic behavior is complicated by shear dependence as re- 
vealed through Figs. 38 a and 38 b, affecting the rheological char- 
acteristics of a gel propellant across multiple stages of its life cy- 
cle, from storage to atomization, albeit with a progressively dimin- 
ishing signiﬁcance. Another aspect of thixotropy of highly sheared 
gel propellants is the necessity to distinguish the equilibrium shear 
viscosity as the intrinsic property of the gel from the instantaneous 
(true) viscosity obtained from the in-line measurements discussed 
in Section 4.2.3 and presented in Fig. 23 . 

Breakdown of the gel state is usually considered in the assess- 
ment of thixotropy of gel propellants. However, rate of structural 
recovery after the shear is removed or reduced, appears to be the 
most important feature of thixotropy for practical purposes. Recov- 
ery is usually slower than gel-sol transition rate [149] . Atomization 
processes generally build shear upstream of breakup point and ex- 
pend shear downstream of the breakup point. Initial shear building 
is slow in the tube ﬂow region of the propellant delivery system, 
rapidly peaks up in the atomizer region, and drops thereafter, usu- 
ally continuously with a long tail [79] . Thus, if the time scales gov- 
erning the transport of propellant from storage tank to the atom- 
izer and the breakup are shorter than the characteristic recovery 
times of the gel, then these processes would not be affected by 
the increasing viscosity accompanying the structural recovery of a 
so called thixotropic gel propellant. 

In  the  atomization,  shear  is  continuously  applied  to  the  gel 
and as such, thixotropy is destroyed while atomization proceeds 
through  various  intermediate  stages.  In  this  sense,  thixotropy  is 
beneﬁcial, especially in the feeding system, where the ﬂuid ﬂows 
for a considerable length of time and shear rates ( ∼100-1000 s −1 ) 
are  relatively  constant.  The  perceived  beneﬁt  of  time-dependent 
viscosity is deﬁnitely subject to the time spent by the gel propel- 
lant in the delivery system and might not be signiﬁcant [ 19 , 141 ]. 
A positive effect of thixotropy is the minor decrease in pressure 
losses [19] . 

4.6. Flow models and dimensionless groups 

4.6.1. Flow models 

Computations and theoretical analyses of the gels require a con- 
stitutive equation at least capable of describing the effects of shear 
on  rheology.  A  large  number  of  such  equations  or  ﬂow  models 
have been proposed (see for example, Ref. [175] ); some of the most 
commonly  used  for  the  gel  propellants  and  their  simulants  are 
listed in Table 10 . These equations are written in their η- ˙ γ form 
and can be converted into an equivalent τ - ˙ γ form. The range of 
applicability of these models varies depending upon the ﬂow con- 
ditions and available rheological data. Perhaps, more important is 
the fact that one model cannot fully simulate the ﬂow behavior. 
Therefore, careful consideration of this issue is required. 

Among  the  ﬂow  models,  Oswald-de  Waele  power  law  (PL), 
Eq.  (2)  is  the  most  extensively  used  ﬂow  model  for  the 

gel  propellants  [ 13 , 14 , 17-19 , 28 , 36 , 47 , 50 , 53 , 77 , 79 , 87 , 88 , 90 , 105 , 126 , 
127 , 132 , 150 , 157 , 161 , 166 , 176-181 ],  followed  by  Herschel-Bulkley 
(HB),  Eq.  (3)  [ 17 , 36 , 51 , 88 , 127 , 161 ],  and  Carreau-Yasuda  (CY) 
[ 40 , 135 , 171 , 182 ], Eq. (4). Others, which have been considered, in- 
clude the extended Herschel-Bulkley (HBE) [ 28 , 48 , 81 , 169 ], three- 
dimensional power law [132] , extensional power law [157] , Casson 
[ 13 , 14 , 161 ], Bingham [161] , Cross [161] , and the exponential decay 
[161] models. 

Among  them,  a  wide  range  of  behaviors  is  covered;  for  ex- 
ample  viscoplastic-yield  stress  (Bingham),  pseudoplastic-limiting 
viscosities (CY), viscoplastic-yield response (Casson), viscoplastic- 
yield  stress-power  law  (HB),  and  pseudoplastic-without  limiting 
viscosities (PL). Fitting a curve to the experimental data using one 
of these models classiﬁes the gel propellant or its simulant in the 
aforementioned classes in a restricted sense. 

Equations  in  Table  10  show  that  the  simplest  ﬂow  model  is 
the Oswald-de Waele ’power law’ model. The more complex mod- 
els  like  HB  and  HBE  encompass  a  power  law  regime  in  which 
the  shear  viscosity  ( η)  decreases  as  a  fractional  power  of  shear 
rate. Power law can model only a limited range of shear rates and 
could  also  be  used  ﬂexibly  to  model  the  yield  stress  ﬂuids  past 
their yield point. It has two adjustable parameters, K is the con- 
sistency  index  and  n  is  the  pseudoplasticity  index.  For  all  prac- 
tically  useful  gel  propellants,  0  <  n  <  1,  with  n → 1  indicating 
a  nearly  Newtonian  behavior  such  that  K → η in  the  Newtonian 
sense. Similarly, n → 0 indicates a dominant pseudoplasticity (shear 
thinning).  The  information  given  in  Table  10  can  be  accordingly 
used to qualitatively judge the viscosity and non-Newtonian char- 
acter  of  the  power  law  gels.  Caution  should  be  exercised  in  ex- 
trapolating the power law predictions beyond the shear rate range 
where K and n were obtained. Such a situation might arise, for ex- 
ample, in the computations of gels in converging ﬂows discussed in 
Section 4.8.2 . 

Two examples of the power law gels are given in Fig. 40 a and 
the dependence of K and n on Y M is plotted in Fig. 40 b. The shear- 
thinning nature of gels remains intact for all the metal fractions 
as shown in Fig. 40 a, but with increased viscosity as metal frac- 
tion improves. The ﬂow behavior is revealed in Fig. 40 b; it shows 
that gel propellants loaded with higher fractions of metal particles 
are also more shear thinning. This is because n decreases at higher 
Y M , while being highly viscous. This situation is reminiscent of the 
extreme shear thinning behavior of particulate gels discussed pre- 
viously in Section 4.2.4 . 

If the yield stress is detected with certainty or if the ﬂow condi- 
tions are likely to involve the effects of yield stress, then it should 
be  included  in  the  ﬂow  model.  Herschel-Bulkley  (HB)  equation 
models the ﬂow of a yield stress shear thinning ﬂuid because the 
term η0 is the apparent shear viscosity at the yield point. η0 is es- 
timated as part of a curve-ﬁtting procedure and in its τ - ˙ γ form, the 
HB equation indirectly yields τ
yield as discussed in Section 4.3 and 
Table  7 .  Water-Carbopol  gels  have  deﬁnite  yield  stress  for  Y G  > 
0.25 % and their behavior is accurately described by the HB model 
as shown in Fig. 41 a.

Correct prediction of τ

yield  is critical for such issues as analy- 
sis of surface tension data (see Section 4.9 ) and correct expression 
of Weber number during the data reduction for atomization ex- 
periments (see Section 5.8 ). Rheological parameters τ
yield , K , and 
n extracted from the HB model applied to water-Carbopol gels are 
shown in Fig. 41 b as a function of the gellant concentration ( Y G ). 
The trends shown here conﬁrm the increasing yield stress of the 
gel as the gellant concentration is increased along with nearly pro- 
portional increase in K . Pseudoplasticity of the gels does not de- 
pend on the gellant concentration as indicated by a nearly con- 
stant n and thus, shear thinning is not affected by the addition of 
gellant. 

’Extended’ HB model can be used to ﬁt the behavior of a yield 
stress  ﬂuid  in  the  high  shear  range  ( ˙ γ >  10 3  s −1 ).  For  this  pur- 
pose, η∞ is also required as seen from Eq. (5) in Table 10 because 
the gel is likely to thin to viscosity values close to the Newtonian 
viscosities. η∞ , which can also be found by curve ﬁtting, is usu- 
ally closer to the viscosity of liquid propellant, but not necessarily 
equal. However, in the absence of data at very high shear rate, such 
a simpliﬁcation is usually introduced. Results of such a curve-ﬁt 
are shown in Fig. 42 . 

Viscosities  at  higher  shear  rates  are  measured  separately  us- 
ing  a  capillary  rheometer  for  closely  approximating  the  viscosi- 
ties at still high shear rates ( ˙ γ → ∞ ). Power law will not ﬁt such 
data  because  the  slope  of  curve  changes  as ˙ γ → ∞ ,  approaching 
the so-called Newtonian plateau. Comparison of Fig. 40 a (- ●-) with 
Fig. 42 shows that the same gel could be modeled differently as 
per the requirements of analysis. 

The effects of metal loading ( Y M ) and particle sizes discovered 
earlier for τ
yield  are shown in Fig. 43 for parameters K and n of 
the HBE model, Eq. (5) [169] . An increase in the concentration of

metal particles enhances the viscous characteristics ( Fig. 43 a) and 
also seems to induce less non-Newtonian behavior ( Fig. 43 b) in the 
gel propellant. However, the variability in the values induced for 
larger Y M  introduces considerable uncertainty regarding the non- 
Newtonian behavior. 

Moreover,  similar  to  the  situation  observed  for  τ
yield 
( Section  4.3 ,  Fig.  29 ),  no  clear  trends  emerge  from  the  data 
in  Fig.  43  when  variations  according  to  the  particle  sizes  are 
considered.  Measurement  errors  in  rotational  rheometry  play 
a  dominant  role  in  the  case  of  extremely  shear  thinning  gel 
propellants such as Jet A1-Thixatrol ST-MIAK.

Another class of the ﬂow models found useful in practice for gel 
propellants includes the equations for purely inelastic and shear 
thinning (pseudoplastic) ﬂuids or ﬂuids of negligible yield stress 
in  the  entire  range  of  shear  rates,  from  storage  to  atomization. 
Carreau-Yasuda (CY) model shown in Eq. (4) of Table 10 is the rep- 
resentative example of this class. It should be noted that unlike the 
case with HB equations, η takes the limiting values η0 and η∞ as 
˙ γ → 0 and  ˙ γ →∞ , respectively ( η0 > η∞ ). These viscosities are in- 
dependent of  ˙ γ for a Carreau-Yasuda ﬂuid and respectively form 
the low and high shear plateaus. The structural parameter λ has 
the unit of time and (1/ λ) is the characteristic shear rate at which 
the viscosity begins to decrease (or at the point λ ˙ γ = 1). a is the 
width of transition region between the low shear plateau repre- 
sented by η0  and the power law region of slope ( n -1). Again, η0 
( ˙ γ → 0) and η∞ ( ˙ γ → ∞ ) can be only approximated and as such, 
they are the adjustable parameters of CY model. For the Carreau 
ﬂuid used by Yoon et al. [178] , a = 2. 

Fig. 44 describes the CY model ﬁtted to water-3 % HPC gel [40] . 
As with the extended HB model, rotational and capillary rheometer 
data were used to obtain the curve-ﬁt with good accuracy. In addi- 
tion, notable in Fig. 44 a is the distinctly visible low shear plateau. 
Such a ﬂow model is very useful in computational simulations in- 
volving gel propellants and is discussed in Section 4.8.2 . Mallory 
et al. [135] ﬁtted CY model to water-HPC gels of different Y G frac- 
tions and their data are shown in Fig. 44 b. Higher gellant concen- 
tration results in increased η0 , a, and λ, as well as decreased n . 
These trends suggest a more viscous (due to the increased η0 ) but 
also more shear thinning (decreased n ) gel that can transition into 
the power law behavior at low shear rate (due to the increased λ) 
but relatively gradually (increased a ) as more gellant is added. 

Value  of  these  results  can  be  recognized  from  the  fact  that 
water-4 % HPC gel behaves similarly to the MMH-4 % HPC gel and 
thus acts as a simulant for the latter so that the handling issues 
associated  with  MMH  are  greatly  simpliﬁed.  However,  similarity 
of the behavior need not extend to the similarity of the four CY 
model parameters, as noted from the data reported in Ref. [135] . 
CY model has been used in the computations of plain oriﬁce ﬂows 
of MMH-4 % HPC [182] . The basis for CY model is the experimental 
data of Arnold et al. [148] that showed that the MMH-4 % HPC gels 
are purely shear thinning and a low shear plateau clearly exists in 
the data. Mallory and Sojka [171] also used the CY model in their 
atomization studies as discussed further. 

Since  the  gel  propellants  always  behave  elastically  and 
thixotropically  in  some  ﬂow  regimes,  the  complexity  introduced 
by these characteristics could be avoided by using shear thinning 
but inelastic ﬂuids of negligible yield stress. Therefore, Rodrigues 
et al. [ 183 , 184 ] used aq. CMC solutions in the impinging jets. They 
measured the rheological characteristics of three aq. CMC solutions 
with  the  help  of  rotational  and  capillary  rheometers.  Rotational 
rheometers were run in the upward and downward sweeps to test 
for and rule out thixotropic effects. Low shear plateau and shear 
thinning were experimentally observed. Their viscosity-shear rate 
data could be ﬁtted using Bird-Carreau model, as shown in Fig. 45 . 
Bird-Carreau (BC) model is a special case of the Carreau-Yasuda 
(CY) model (Eq. (4) in Table 10 ) that is obtained by setting a = 2 in 
Eq. (4). Aq. CMC-7HF has higher molecular weight (700 kDa) com- 
pared to aq. CMC-7MF (250 kDa) [ 183 , 184 ]. Fig. 45 suggests that 
BC model could reasonably ﬁt the behavior of aq. CMC solutions 
under the assumed high-shear Newtonian plateau (i.e. η∞ → 0.001

sis of dilute suspension of spherical particles in a Newtonian ﬂuid. 
The  predictions  suggest  that  the  viscosity  increases  more  if  the 
suspending ﬂuid exhibits more shear thinning and the new ﬂuid 
is  also  more  shear  thinning.  Chernov  and  Natan  [185]  extended 
the results for higher particle concentrations using the integral ap- 
proach. While greater extent of shear thinning is considered ad- 
vantageous for propulsion applications [185] , in a recent review on 
the topic of non-colloidal suspensions, Tanner [186] has critiqued 
the predictions of analysis reported in Ref. [177] . 

4.6.2. Dimensionless groups 

Since  the  viscosity  of  gel  propellants  affects  their  ﬂow,  the 
usual dimensionless groups are modiﬁed to reﬂect the dependence 
on shear. Moreover, spatial dependence of the characteristic shear 
level (see Fig. 19 ) suggests that it is also essential to refer to the 
location at which the dimensionless groups are to be determined. 
This issue is often neglected in the atomization studies or not re- 
ported consistently. 

Reynolds  number  ( Re )  is  modiﬁed  into  a  generalized  form 
( Re gen ) using the underlying ﬂow model [28] . Ohnesorge number 
( Oh ) is also estimated using the shear-dependence embedded in 
the appropriate ﬂow model. A related problem is the f - Re gen  re- 
lationship for the ﬂow of gel propellants in tubes where f is the 
friction factor, either described by Fanning ( f F ) or Darcy-Weisbach 
( f DW ) friction factors. Signiﬁcant work has been done on this topic, 
beginning with Metzner and Reed [187] . According to Metzner and 
Reed  [187] ,  Re gen  emphasizes  that  the  usual  f - Re gen  relationship 
( f F = 16/ Re for laminar ﬂows) is obeyed by all ﬂuids, provided wall- 
slip does not occur and Re gen  is deﬁned appropriately. They also 
specify conformity to the f F = 16/ Re gen as a test for the consistency 
of data, accuracy of calculation, or the presence of extraneous rhe- 
ological effects embedded in power law. Madlener et al. [28] ob- 
tained the above relationship for gel propellants paraﬃn-Thixatrol 
ST-MIAK, paraﬃn-Aerosil, and Jet A1-Thixatrol ST-MIAK using the 
HBE  model  in  Re gen .  Table  11  summarizes  the  Re gen  expressions 
(Eqs. (10)-(16)), which can be derived for a speciﬁc ﬂow model us- 
ing the procedure given, for example, in Refs. [ 28 , 187 ]. Expression 
for Re gen using the CY model has also been reported [171] . Unlike 
the case with power law ﬂuids, the equations for critical Re gen for 
transition of laminar ﬂows of gels obeying other ﬂow models men- 
tioned in Table 10 are not available. 

Proposals  of  Metzner  and  Reid  are  tested  in  Figs.  46  and  47

the data obtained in pipes or tubes [ 53 , 77 , 79 , 187 ]. Dashed lines indicate deviations

Pa.s). The data could be easily interpreted following the previous 
example of CY model. 

Constitutive models capable of covering the plateau regions ap- 
proached at  ˙ γ → 0 and  ˙ γ →∞ are convenient for computational 
purposes. HBE and CY models fall under this category because they 
are valid over the complete range of shear rates encountered in 
storage, delivery, and atomization of gel propellants and do not ex- 
hibit singularity at  ˙ γ = 0, unlike the HB model. Curve ﬁtting is usu- 
ally all that is needed to obtain the adjustable parameters in the 
ﬂow models. Amount of information on the structure of gel pro- 
pellant contained in the CY model is also signiﬁcant (see Fig. 44 ). 
In this respect, shear rate range accessible to the rotational (RR) 
and capillary (CR) rheometers is also of interest. Usually, two or 
more rheometers (at least one being a CR) are required to obtain 
the required shear rate range. The most important application of 
CY model could be in the numerical computations of pseudoplas- 
tic gels and the extended HB model could fulﬁll a similar function. 
These applications are discussed in Section 4.8.2 . 

Measurements required for the viscoelastic ﬂuids to obtain the 
ﬁtting parameters of all-encompassing ﬂow models are extensive. 
Simplicity  is  thus  a  key  issue  in  the  development  of  ﬂow  mod- 
els  and  in  this  scenario,  studies  by  Yarin  et  al.  [132]  and  Man- 
sour and Chigier [157] are illustrative of the ﬂexibility of PL ﬂow 
model. Mansour and Chigier [157] used an ’extensional’ power law 
given in Eq. (7) of Table 10 to describe the extensional thicken- 
ing of water-PAA system. Their results have already been discussed 
in Section 4.2.3 (see Fig. 23 a) in connection with the estimation 
of extensional viscosity. Yarin et al. used a photographic method 
to determine the extensional viscosity of water-(0.3-1 %) Carbopol 
gel,  as  described  in  Ref.  [132] .  Their  data  indicate  that  ˙ ε = 10 2 - 
10 3 s −1 is reached in such measurements. The purely elongational 
ﬂow of the gel was then compared with purely shear ﬂow and the 
power law parameter n was ∼0.4 for both types of ﬂows. κ ( = K / σ ) 
was also similar between the two ﬂows within the experimental 
limitations. These results indicate that the viscoelastic behavior of 
Carbopol gel could be inferred by power law data obtained using 
purely shear ﬂow [132] . 

Yarin et al. [132] also suggested that the validity of power law is 
indicative of its applicability when both types of ﬂows (shear and 
extension) are present in one ﬂow ﬁeld. A possible situation of this 
ﬂow  ﬁeld occurs  in  the  atomization of  gels  when the  ligaments 
and droplets undergo breakup. However, the shear history of these 
fragments should also be considered. 

Chernov  and  Natan  [177]  used  the  approximation  of  a  near- 
Newtonian PL ﬂuid for developing a new ﬂow model of the metal- 
ized gel fuel, which considers the suspension of metal particles as 
a new ﬂuid with parameters K " and n " . They used Einstein’s analy-

on various gel propellants and power law ﬂuids by compiling the 
available data in some cases [ 28 , 187 ]. Further, we also estimated 
f F in selected cases from the published data [ 47 , 48 , 50 , 53 , 77 , 79 , 81 ]. 
The relation for transition regime (see Ref. [187] ) is also shown in 
each of these ﬁgures. 

In Fig. 46 , we observe a deviation of -1-20 % from the theoreti- 
cal relationship. The laminar region seems to extend to Re gen → 10 4 
for some gel propellants ( ●) that are loaded with up to 20 % nano- 
alumina particles [ 77 , 79 ], while power law ﬂuid composed of 14.3 
% clay in water [187] most probably ﬂows in the transition regime. 
Additional  comparisons  for  water-Carbopol  gels  classiﬁed  as 
power  law  ﬂuids  [ 47 , 50 ]  are  obtained  using  the  reported  power 
law parameters in Fig. 47 a. Large deviations from the theoretical 
relationship are found in these cases. On the other hand, at least 
one dataset for Carbopol gel loaded with 15 % SUS304 nanoparti- 
cles shows deviation on the negative side that is clearly indicative 
of a behavior other than the power law. 

It should be noted that the data in Fig. 47 a were obtained us- 
ing power law parameters extrapolated beyond the highest shear 
level of the experimental data. The extrapolation was carried out 
to a level characteristic of the oriﬁce used in the atomization stud- 
ies. Thus, the deviations shown in Fig. 47 a could indicate that the 
considered  gels  did  not  follow  power  law  behavior  at  the  high 
shear  rates  reached  during  oriﬁce  ﬂows.  Similar  conclusions  can 
be drawn from the trends of data shown in Fig. 47 b, this time for 
HBE model of A-A gel [48] . 

Madlener et al. [28] published data for Jet A1-Thixatrol ST-MIAK 
HBE  gels  using  the  Darcy-Weisbach  friction  factor  ( f DW = 4 f F )  by 
employing the curve-ﬁtting for HBE on the combined ﬂow curves 
of rotational and capillary rheometers so that the viscosity data are 
covered for an entire range of shear rates. Their results are plotted 
in Fig. 47 c and show deviations within ±20 % of the theoretical 
relationship. Deviations increased for Re gen,HBE  > 3 × 10 3  and are 
likely to be in the transition regime of pipe ﬂow, although they do

A  number  of  simulants  have  been  identiﬁed  so  far,  some  of 
which are summarized in Table 12 and more extensive listing was 
done in Section 3.1.5 . Previous sections of the present review have 
extensively  reported  on  the  many  studies  performed  on  water- 
Carbopol  gels  that  are  also  considered  simulants  for  gel  propel- 
lants, although not always matched systematically with the actual 
gel propellants. 

Matching  of  the  properties  between  the  propellant  and  sim- 
ulant  is  the  ﬁrst  step  in  the  development  of  a  suitable  simu- 
lant. The most relevant properties to match would depend upon 
the  objectives  of  comparison  and  appropriate  methods  could  be 
devised to achieve a meaningful comparison. The choice of sim- 
ulant  propellants  could  also  be  made  using  other  propellants 
of  similar  class.  A  typical  propellant  could  also  be  used  as  a 
simulant,  as  done  for  example  by  Kalyon  et  al.  [189]  for  solid 
propellants. 

Rahimi et al. [87] have presented a method for the rheological 
matching between gel propellant and its simulant. Their method 
is illustrated in Fig. 49 . The ﬁrst step would typically involve the 
selection of a gellant based on its ability to give a rheologically 
ﬂexible gel. This gel should be capable of showing a wide enough 
variation in the rheological parameters when the factors affecting 
rheology are tweaked. Multiple rheological tests were carried out 
to extract the required rheological parameters ( K and n in Fig. 49 ). 
As observed from Fig. 49 , a combination of the gellants could also 
be used to obtain a so-called hybrid gel and to increase the scope 
of variations by introducing another degree of freedom. In the sec- 
ond step, all possible variations in the factors were reduced to the 
empirical correlations of the involved rheological parameters. The 
gel propellant was then subjected to rheological tests in the third 
step so that the rheological parameters to be matched could be 
obtained. Fourth step used the developed correlations to estimate 
the factors that would give the same K and n as the actual gel pro- 
pellant. Thus, a rheologically matched simulant was achieved for 
future studies. 

Rheological matching need not be conﬁned to a simulant and 
actual gel propellant itself. Similar method can be employed for 
specifying the correct concentration of gellants when deciding the 
delivery  system  for  a  pair  of  gel  fuel  and  oxidizer  [87] .  More- 
over,  the  choice  of  rheological  parameters  to  match  would  also 
vary from case to case. For example, Green et al. [127] matched 
the  yield  stress  of  RP-1-Al  gels  with  the  simulant  water-NaOH- 
Carbopol gel in addition to the viscosity in the pseudoplastic (shear 
thinning) range. 

The rheological properties of water-Carbopol gels have been in- 
vestigated thoroughly. However, while water-Carbopol gel is usu- 
ally modeled as a yield stress ﬂuid, its properties are more com- 
plicated  [190] .  This  gel  is  also  commonly  considered  as  a  simu- 
lant for gel propellants in many investigations, as would be found 
in  this  paper.  Further,  some  instances  of  the  rheological  com- 
plexities  of  Carbopol  have  also  been  uncovered  in  the  discus- 
sion  (for  example,  Section  4.3 ,  see  Fig.  31 ).  Therefore,  it  is  ad- 
visable  to  carefully  consider  the  complexities  in  its  rheological 
behavior.

not follow the relationship describing the transition regime of HBE 
ﬂuids. 

We have previously alluded to the ever-changing shear rates in 
the gel propellant feeding and injection system (see Fig. 19 ). By far, 
the levels of shear at the extreme downstream end of the injection 
system, i.e. atomizer oriﬁce, are the most critical for successful at- 
omization. Rodrigues et al. [184] used generalized Carreau number 
( Cu gen ) for the characterization of non-Newtonian behavior at the 
oriﬁce. By deﬁnition, it is a generalization of the speciﬁc Carreau 
number Cu = λ ˙ γ used to indicate whether the ﬂuid is in the shear 
thinning  range  (after  the  low-shear  viscosity  plateau)  at  a  given 
shear rate [184] . For a Bird-Carreau (BC) ﬂuid, the Cu gen is deﬁned 
as below in Eq. (17) .

Experimentally  estimated  Cu gen  are  plotted  in  Fig.  48  against 

the dimensionless viscosities ( η∗ = η( ˙ γ ) / η∞ ). 

All the ﬂuids considered in Fig. 48 could be atomized in the im- 
pinging jets. Thus, the generalized Carreau numbers reached prior 
to atomization are > > 1, while η∗ > 1suggests that atomization is 
possible even while the ﬂuids are more viscous than DI water. 

4.7. Rheological matching 

Many of the base fuels considered for gel fuels are toxic, exam- 
ples being MMH and UDMH. Some oxidizers are diﬃcult to handle, 
for example FNA and HP. While gelation in itself is a way out of 
these diﬃculties, exposure to the toxic fuels and dangerous oxidiz- 
ers during developmental phase can be further reduced by substi- 
tuting safer and economical alternatives. Thus, the next best alter- 
native to actual gel propellants in some phases of a development 
program is a gel propellant simulant, a substance mimicking their 
behavior. Here, we are concerned exclusively with the simulants 
intended for cold ﬂow studies.

4.8. Theoretical and numerical analysis 

Flow  models  discussed  in  Section  4.6.1  are  very  useful  in 
the  theoretical  and  numerical  analyses  of  instability,  ﬂow  of 
gel  propellants  in  pipes,  atomizers,  and  combustion.  Current 
progress  in  this  area  is  now  reviewed.  Three  major  categories 
can  be  identiﬁed;  ﬂow  through  pipes  and  atomizer  passages 
[ 18 , 19 , 108 , 141 , 142 , 176 , 178-182 ]  and  atomization  itself  [41] ,  in- 
stability  of  sheets  [120] ,  jets  [ 126 , 191-196 ],  and  large  droplets 
[ 166 , 197 ], and combustion of gel droplets. In addition, the use of 
mechanical models in the phenomenological description of rheol- 
ogy  [ 88 , 197 ]  is  another  method  for  modeling  and  analyzing  the 
ﬂow of gels considered in this section. 

Among the many mechanical models used in rheological char- 
acterization,  Burger  [88] ,  Burger-Kelvin  [88] ,  Maxwell  [197] ,  Ol- 
droyd (8 constants) [192-194] , and Oldroyd B [195] , have been used 
most  commonly  to  analyze  the  breakup  [197]  and  instability  of 
viscoelastic  solids  and  liquids  [192-195] .  We  also  discuss  an  at- 
tempt  at  using  these  models  for  classifying  gel  propellants  [88] .

Our focus here is on the same four properties relevant for the 
downstream ﬂow of gels in the delivery system. These studies have 
considered them as in shear viscosity [ 19 , 176 , 180 , 182 ], yield stress 
[108] ,  viscoelasticity  [ 88 , 197 ],  and  thixotropy  [ 141 , 142 , 179 , 198 ]. 
Table 13 summarizes the selected studies in the aforementioned 
categories. 

4.8.1. Mechanical models and rheological classiﬁcation 

Rahimi et al. [88] used their creep-recovery tests and a gener- 
alized viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt solid-Maxwell liquid (GKVM) model 
to classify water-Carbopol and JP-5-AO gels. Regression analysis to 
obtain  the  model  parameters  revealed that  a  range  of  behaviors 
could be expected from these gels, depending on the applied stress 
( τ 0 ) and gellant concentration ( Y G ). As shown in Table 14 , one type 
of gel could behave as a simple Maxwell viscoelastic liquid or its 
behavior could be characterized by multiple nonlinear time factors 
extracted from a combination of two Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic solid 
and one Maxwell liquid components. 

Above classiﬁcation for water-1 % Carbopol gel is approximately 
similar to that of Kim et al. [161] (see also Fig. 35 b). We previously 
noted  the  complexity  of  viscoelastic  behavior  in  Section  4.4  for 
MMH-HPC and MMH-HPC-Aerosil gels (see Fig. 35 c) that undergo a 
change from being Maxwell liquids at low frequencies to perfectly 
elastic solids at high frequencies [150] . On the other hand, MMH- 
Aerosil gel was classiﬁed as Kelvin-Voight solid for the entire range 
of frequencies [150] . 

Rahimi  et  al.  [88]  measured  the  rheological  parameters  and 
grouped  rheologically  similar  gel  propellants  and  simulants  into 
three classes. Type A gels are shear thinning with low thixotropy

and yield stress. Gels of hydrazine and water can exhibit this be- 
havior. Type B gels generally include hydrocarbon fuels exhibiting 
viscoelasticity, and type C gels are characterized by a high yield 
stress  and  thixotropic  behavior,  observed  in  IRFNA  and  HP  gels. 
Examples  cited  in  Section  4.4  and  discussed  above  indicate  that 
water-Carbopol and MMH-HPC gels are also viscoelastic to some 
degree. Further, a Maxwell liquid like water-XG [197] could also be 
subjected to secondary breakup. 

Rahimi  and  Weihs  [166]  utilized  the  parallel  spring-dash  pot 
analogy (KV viscoelastic solid) to model the impact dynamics of 
water-0.3 % Carbopol gel droplet and solve for the position of its 
center of mass. Image processing for the position of droplet and 
the solution of KV model were compared favorably in this case and 
the damped oscillatory behavior of droplet position as it spreads 
upon impact was revealed. Such studies should be useful in future 
for investigations on droplet dynamics. 

4.8.2. Flow through pipes and oriﬁces 

Chernov and Natan [206] examined the effects of metal particle 
loading and local shear rate on the viscosity while the gel ﬂows 
through a feeding system. For this purpose, the gel was modeled as 
a dilute power-law suspension of cylindrical particles ( n → 1) and 
creeping ﬂow without bounding walls was assumed. Creeping ﬂow 
equations (in polar coordinates) were derived in the limit ( n → 1) 
such that non-Newtonian effects are additive small perturbations 
to the Newtonian ﬁeld, i.e. π = π N + επ
1 + …, where π ≡ u, v, P , 
and ε = 0.5( n − 1)takes values ε < < 1. Next, a relationship between 
the viscosity and particle volume fraction ( φ) was derived as given 
by Eq. (20). Subscript ’0 (cid:3)  indicates absence of particles in the PL 
ﬂuid.

Fig. 50 gives the nature of relationship between ( K/ K 0 ) and n as 

it is inﬂuenced by the magnitudes of parameters  ˙ γ and φ. 

Fig. 50 shows that different combinations of the parameters ( K, 
n ) are possible, although only one of them is physically realistic. It 
is expected that increasing the concentration of particles would in- 
crease K and decrease n . These trends lead to the conclusion that a 
concentrated suspension of metal particles is likely to approach ex- 
treme shear thinning behavior ( Fig. 50 b), possibly beginning from a 
high zero-shear viscosity. Fig. 50 a shows that the present approach 
predicts this behavior for high shear rates (–• –). 

Flow models are used to estimate the local viscosity in compu- 
tations of ﬂows in pipes, atomizer passages, and sprays. Thixotropy 
and yield stress have also been investigated. Flow through oriﬁces 
is often selected for these studies because this stage determines 
the viscosity of gel just before the onset of atomization and it is 
usually of a great interest owing to the very high level of shear 
rates reached for a short duration of time. Rahimi and Natan solved 
the ﬂow of power law gels through smooth converging oriﬁces an- 
alytically  [19]  and  numerically  [176]  for  small  and  large  conver- 
gence half-angle ( α), respectively. 

Analytical solutions become possible because the radial veloc- 
ity ( u r ) and its gradients ∂ u r / ∂r and ∂ u r / ∂z in radial ( r ) and axial 
( z ) directions could be neglected in the limit of small α. Moreover, 
axial gradients are ∼O ( α) compared to the radial gradients, which 
are ∼O (1) so that the power law behavior can be ascribed to the 
τ rz  component of stress tensor. Apparent viscosity ( ηapp ) was es- 
timated from the local shear rate and power law parameters for 
the  considered  gels  and  the  mean  apparent  viscosity  ( ηmean,app ) 
for  a  given  cross-section  of  the  oriﬁce  was  then  deﬁned  using 
Eq. (21) with reference to the deﬁnition sketch in Fig. 51 .

Fig. 51 a is the typical spatial distribution of apparent viscosity 
within the oriﬁce (shown up to r = 0.4 mm) of a PL-gel wherein, 
the viscosity decreases monotonously radially outward and down- 
stream due to the increasing shear. Rapp and Zurawski [15] have 
modeled Al/RP-1 gels as PL ﬂuids. Predicted effect of the Al frac- 
tion  on  viscosity  in  Figs.  51 b  and  51 c  reveals  that  Y M = 55  %  is 
an optimal concentration for Al [19] . Observation of the K and n 
data for Al/RP-1 gels ( Table 1 in Ref. [19] ) shows non-monotonic 
changes in the PL parameters with increase in Y M . Data of Jejurkar 
et al. ( Table 3 in Ref. [77] ) for ISROsene-Thixatrol ST-nano-alumina 
also shows such non-monotonic changes in K and n . It seems that 
the  non-monotonic  changes  are  related  to  the  inhomogeneity  of 
highly particulate gels [77] and their tendency to undergo extreme

shear thinning. More investigations are needed to characterize the 
causes. 

In the limit of large α, Rahimi and Natan [176] obtained ax- 
isymmetric numerical solutions to the same problem in order to 
avoid  the  deviations that  would  result  from  using  the  analytical 
approach of Ref. [19] . They noted a monotonous decrease of the 
mean apparent viscosity as in Fig. 51 d and expected improvement 
in  shear  thinning  in  response  to  the  higher  ﬂow  rate  ( Fig.  51 e) 
and smaller gellant concentration ( Fig. 51 f). For the same oriﬁce di- 
mensions, the extent of shear thinning is similar for all ﬂow rates 
in Fig. 51 e and for all gellant fractions in Fig. 51 f. Thus, α exerts 
greater inﬂuence on shear thinning. 

√ 

Further investigations on the converging ﬂows of PL-gels were 
conducted by Rahimi et al. [180] using a combined analytical and 
numerical approach on rough walls. The power law in their case 
modeled the range of behavior including Newtonian and von Mises 
perfectly plastic solid. Friction effects were modeled by introduc- 
ing slip at the walls in proportion to the wall shear stress τw = 
3 ) τe where m is the friction factor such that m = 0 for smooth 
( m/ 
wall and m = 1 for perfectly rough wall. τ e is the von Mises effec- 
tive stress [180] . Care was taken to avoid the wall slip effects in 
the rheological measurements required to obtain K and n of the 
power law for HP, MMH, and IRFNA gels [180] . The required vari- 
ables were estimated using the following relations Eqs. (22) -( (24) ), 
shown  here  for  small α and  m  with  reference  to  the  deﬁnition 
sketch of Fig. 52 . General expressions for the same quantities that 
were used to produce the results compiled in Fig. 52 can be found 
in Ref. [180] .

With reference to Eq. (22) and predictions of the detailed mod- 
els shown in Fig. 52 a for the three gels, the mean apparent vis- 
cosity decreases if the friction factor is increased. A corresponding 
increase in the pressure drop is also observed from Eq. (23) and 
Fig.  52 b.  The  viscosity  ratio  between  the  outlet  and  inlet  de- 
creases  as  the  convergence  half-angle  is  increased  as  seen  from 
Eq. (24) and Fig. 52 c. Further, Eq. (24) indicates that the viscosity 
ratio is independent of Q and analysis of the internal ﬂow ﬁeld is 
not required to estimate the reduction in viscosity [180] . Rahimi 
et  al.  [180]  point  out  that  the  reduction  in  viscosity  is  also  ac- 
companied by more pressure drop when friction is deliberately in- 
troduced in the oriﬁce walls. Thus, a trade-off exists between the 
improved atomization characteristics obtained by reduced viscosity 
and the tolerable pressure drop of the feeding system tubes. 

Thixotropic  considerations  are  incorporated  in  computations 
through the kinetics of a dimensionless structural parameter ( λ) 
[ 141 , 142 , 179 , 198 ] as a premultiplier to a suitable ﬂow model, for 
example PL [179] and HB [141] , or using some form of the evolu- 
tion equation for λ [ 142 , 198 ]. λ denotes the fraction of intact in- 
terparticle bonds with respect to the intact bonds before yielding 
[207] . λ = 1 in the fully structured state (at the zero time of shear 
application), and λ = λeq ( λeq < 1) once the rates of the simultane- 
ous breakdown and recovery processes equilibrate after suﬃciently 
long time has elapsed. Table 15 lists the relevant details. Mujumdar 
et al. [207] classiﬁed this approach as ’indirect microstructural’ and 
gave the generalized evolution equation for λ in Eq. (25) . k

As mentioned before, the breakdown and recovery of structure 
are simultaneous processes and hence, the thixotropic behavior is 
always considered reversible. At times, the recovery is much slower 
than breakdown and the characteristic ﬂow time scales would be 
much  smaller  than  the  recovery  time  scales.  Under  such  condi- 
tions, the recovery phase can be entirely neglected ( k r = 0) as con- 
sidered by Rahimi and Natan [141] and Di Salvo et al. [179] (see 
Table 15 ). Further, the ﬂow time scales might be smaller than the 
thixotropic breakdown (see Fig. 19 ), in which case, the thixotropic 
destruction of the structure itself can be entirely neglected. 

Among the surveyed papers shown in Table 15 , a and b have 
been assumed without independent estimates of λ-t . Hence, ad- 
equate  validations  are  required  before  such  a  multi-parameter 
thixotropic ﬂow model is used for predictions. So far, only limited 
progress has been achieved in this area, validations using η-t and 
(cid:2)P - Q  by  Di  Salvo  et  al.  [179]  and  C 
d - ˙ m by  Yoon  et  al.  [198]  be- 
ing  the  noteworthy  examples.  Incorporation  of  the  thixotropic 
sub-model  in  the  shear  ﬂow  model  results  in  a  complex  multi- 

parameter model. A typical ﬁtting procedure for such a model is 
illustrated in Fig. 53 using the datasets of Rahimi and Natan [141] . 
Among the six parameters ( λeq , τ
yield , K, n, a, c ), λeq , a , and c are 
shear-dependent. 

Analysis of the available data [ 141 , 179 ] suggests that extrapola- 
tions outside the range of shear rates used for ﬁtting procedures, 
in which η-t is the most conveniently used dataset [ 141 , 179 ], could 
lead to erroneous predictions. Further, as thixotropic effects are not 
limited just to the shear viscosity [ 149 , 207 ], the classiﬁcation of 
the  gel  should  be  carefully  considered  so  that  a  correct  model- 
ing approach could be adopted. In this respect, Rahimi and Natan 
[141] did not discuss the thixotropic effects on the yield stress of 
the water gel. 

Yoon et al. [ 142 , 198 ] considered purely thixotropic ﬂow based 
on the evolution equation of λ in space and time and modiﬁed it 
into an equivalent Eq. (26) for the shear viscosity by assuming that 
the instantaneous viscosity ( η’ ) is linearly dependent on λ, that is 
η’ = η∞ + c λ.

η was  estimated  by  a  ﬂow  model  (Carreau  [ 142 , 198 ]  and  CY 
[198] ).  Due  to  the  lack  of  data  on  k 
b  and  k r ,  the  rate  constants 
b λ and  c r = k r  in  the  range 
b = k 
were  prescribed  arbitrarily  as  c 
of  time  scales  prevalent  in  the  ﬂow  through  oriﬁce  problem. 
Apart from the breakdown and recovery, the extent of hysteresis 
was also to be incorporated. Hence, breakdown was represented

b and c r in the range (5 t c,o ) −1 
was presented in brief by adjusting c 
where t c,o is the time scale for ﬂow of water-4 % HPC gel through 
a plain oriﬁce [198] . 

Yoon et al. [142] previously used the same model to compute 
the ﬂow of a generic Carreau ﬂuid in the plain oriﬁce. Salient re- 
sults of that study are compiled in Fig. 54 . 

With  reference  to  Eq.  (27) ,  unlike  the  case  with  water  gel 
[141] considered in the description above for which only the break- 
down was signiﬁcant, Yoon et al. [142] also considered the recov- 
ery phase as signiﬁcant and the resulting instantaneous viscosity 
regime  is  spatially  distributed  in  the  oriﬁce  of  Fig.  54 a.  Regions 
of high shear near the wall are fully thinned, region immediately 
downstream of the vena contracta has almost fully recovered be- 
cause of reduced shear levels, while the region further downstream 
is in the intermediate stages depending upon the underlying mo- 
mentum ﬁeld. 

Vortex  shedding  occurs  from  the  vena  contracta  as  shown  in 
Fig. 54 b so that the inﬂuence of the resulting unsteady momen- 
tum ﬁeld on the rheological state of the gel shown in Fig. 54 a can 
be perceived. The details of vortex structures are however, scale- 
dependent and their dissipation is likely to be stronger in shear 
thinning and thixotropic ﬂuids. 

Fig.  54 c  distinguishes  the  response  of  shear  thinning  and 
thixotropic  ﬂuids.  A  shear  thinning  gel  would  recover  instan- 
taneously  in  the  downstream  regions  when  compared  to  the 
thixotrope that would recover at a slower rate. These differences 
b  and c r 
are however only qualitatively comparable because the c 
are chosen arbitrarily. Thus, recovery might not be appreciable in 
practice. 

Fig. 54 d shows the parametric effects of the indicated rates of 
decrease and increase of viscosity in the breakdown and recovery 
phases in terms of the spatial instantaneous viscosity distributions.

smaller l o /d o for gels be used as per Fig. 56 b. Second, C

more sensitive to ( u 1 /u 2 ) as per Fig. 56 c, so that the manifold de- 
sign should be optimized with this constraint. 

4.8.3. Instability of sheets, jets, and droplets 

High viscosity is one of the deﬁning features of a gel propel- 
lant that affects the instability of sheets. Therefore, instability anal- 
ysis applied to the sheets composed of highly viscous but Newto- 
nian ﬂuids like paraﬃn could be useful to understand the effects 
of viscosity as a ﬁrst approximation. Heislbetz et al. [208] inves- 
tigated the breakup of paraﬃn sheets formed by the doublet im- 
pinging jets. Measurements of breakup time ( t 
b ), 
and sheet breakup lengths ( L 
b ) were compared with the predic- 
tions of a linear temporal stability theory. Dominant sinuous per- 
turbations were considered in the analysis based on the dispersion 
relation ﬁrst given by Li and Tankin [209] and reproduced below 
in Eq. (28a) .

turbations  and  k  is  the  wavenumber.  The  parameter  q  is  given 
by  Eq.  (28b) .  Heislbetz  et  al.  [208]  approximated  Eq.  (28b)  by 
Eq. (28c) to account for the high viscosity of paraﬃn and solved 
Eq. (28a) for the growth rate in short- and long-wave limits. Sheet

Fig. 57 shows the results for paraﬃn in which, the variations 
in sheet velocity are expressed in terms of the sheet Weber num- 
ber ( We s ) deﬁned as W e s = ρ

Fig. 57 shows that stability theory including the high-viscosity 
approximation predicts the trends in λ
b within a restricted 
range of We s (and Re s ). Further, the analysis [208] also showed that 
predictions obtained with the high-viscosity approximation are not 
substantially  different  from  the  low-viscosity  limit  in  the  range 
Re s = 280 0-280 0 0, We s = 168-16800.

Gel  propellants  formulated  using  the  polymeric  gellants  are 
viscoelastic.  The  breakup  of  fragments  of  such  gels  during  at- 
omization  is  thus  likely  to  be  affected  by  viscoelasticity.  Goldin 
et al. [191] conducted a linear stability analysis of the viscoelas- 
tic jet and found that it was less stable than a Newtonian jet of 
equal zero shear viscosity ( η0 ), irrespective of the underlying ﬂow 
model. They also noticed the beads-on-a-string (boas) structures 
in  strongly  elastic  ﬂuids  and  recognized  this  behavior  as  due  to 
the nonlinear viscoelastic effects. It was suggested to consider the

Evidently, high breakdown and recovery rates ( c 
sult in a behavior similar to any shear thinning gel and smoother 
distribution of viscosity is observed for relatively slower processes 
b = c r = 10 5 s −1 ). Very slow recovery rate ( c r = 10 3 s −1 ) leads to a 
( c 
dramatic reduction in the viscosity in the core region. 

The symmetric ﬂow within the oriﬁce upstream of vena con- 
tracta  is  an  artifact  of  the  imposed  boundary  conditions  in  the 
computations of Yoon et al. [142] . In practice, multi-element at- 
omizers fed by a common manifold are used and the ﬂow in in- 
dividual oriﬁces (characteristic velocity u 2 ) is subject to the asym- 
metry induced by cross ﬂow in the manifold with a characteristic 
velocity u 1 [182] . Yoon et al. [182] analyzed the responses of differ- 
ent MMH-HPC gel propellants modeled as purely shear thinning by 
CY ﬂow model to the ﬂow asymmetry and compared them against 
MMH, as shown in Fig. 55 . 

The  cross  ﬂow  generates  a  stronger  recirculation  zone  at  the 
upstream side of vena contracta and the downstream side recircu- 
lation zone is weak, or entirely non-existent. The viscous damp- 
ing inherent in high viscosity manifests as gels of higher η∞ ﬂow 
through  the  manifold-oriﬁce.  Hydrodynamic  instabilities  lead  to 
vortex shedding and ﬂow asymmetry alters the velocity and vis- 
cosity  distributions  in  transverse  direction.  Viscosity  ﬂuctuations 
are set up and could change the spray patterns developing down- 
stream. 

The periodic nature of these ﬂuctuations is observed in Fig. 56 a 
in terms  of the Strouhal number ( St ).  It is clear that  higher η∞ 
damped these ﬂuctuations only marginally (although high viscosi- 
ties are not attained as ˙ γ → ∞ ), apparently because the instability 
of the reattachment point dominates the hydrodynamic instabili- 
ties [182] . On the other hand, viscous damping ( η0 / η∞ ) improves 
the discharge coeﬃcient ( C 
d ) of the oriﬁce. Results summarized in 
Figs. 56 b and 56 c lead to important conclusions regarding the de- 
sign of multi-element atomizers. First, C

elastic properties on and above the high η0 for appropriate selec- 
tion of a thickening agent (gellant) during gelation. Goldin et al. 
[126] have discussed the failure of linear stability theory in predic- 
tions for highly viscoelastic ﬂuids and provided many examples of 
ﬂuids for which the linear stability theory could fail. 

These works have been revisited and extended in recent times 
[192-194] . Brenn et al. [192] reached similar conclusions as Goldin 
et al. [191] when they analyzed the propagation of axisymmetric 
disturbance  on  the  surface  of  a  viscoelastic  liquid  jet  using  the 
corotational Oldroyd eight-constant model. Liu and Liu [193] ex- 
tended the analysis of Brenn et al. [192] for higher modes includ- 
ing the sinusoidal disturbances ( n m = 1) and again reached similar 
conclusions regarding the linear stability analysis [ 191 , 193 ] in the 
process. In particular, they found that the ratio ( (cid:20) = ( λ1 / λ2 )) of 
retardation time ( λ2 ) and relaxation time ( λ1 ) weakly affected the 
instability. 

Goren and Gottlieb [199] recognized the axial tension normal 
to the ﬂow direction ( T e ) as the stabilizing factor for a viscoelastic 
jet. Geckler and Sojka [195] used the resulting dispersion relation 
along with a term incorporating the axial tension and Oldroyd B 

This modiﬁcation helps to incorporate the nonlinear viscoelas- 
tic effects near the breakup and a correct prediction for the wave- 
length of the fastest growing disturbance is obtained. It is noted 
here  that  the  analyses  of  Refs.  [191-194]  assume  that  the  vis- 
coelastic ﬂuid is fully relaxed ( T e = 0) and consider a Maxwell ﬂuid 
(ideal viscoelastic liquid) for which (cid:20) = 0. Fig. 58 illustrates some 
of the familiar results of the linear stability analysis of viscoelas- 
tic  jets.  Ohnesorge  and  elasticity  numbers  are  deﬁned  as  ( Oh = 
η0 / 

ρσ d c and El = λη0 / ρd 2 
c ). 

(cid:2) 

Effects of unrelaxed axial tension on the breakup of viscoelastic 
capillary jets have also been investigated using the linear stability 
analyses [200-202] . Oldroyd B constitutive model has been used 
in these analyses. Most of the above investigations use the tempo- 
ral instability analysis. Xie et al. [202] performed spatial instabil- 
ity analysis of the effects of the spatially decaying unrelaxed axial 
stress on the viscoelastic jet. Viscoelasticity was modeled by Ol- 
droyd B model. For relaxation times longer than a critical value, 
competition  between  the  stabilizing  effect  of  unrelaxed  tension 
and destabilizing effect of  spatial decay determined the stability 
and breakup length of the capillary jet. Oldroyd B model has also 
been used to analyze the stability of viscoelastic sheets in terms of 
the effects of sinuous mode [203] , unrelaxed axial tension [204] , 
and varicose mode [205] with the help of weakly nonlinear tem- 
poral stability analysis. 

4.8.4. Combustion models 

We  will  discuss  the  models  based  on  phenomenological  de- 
scription of droplet vaporization and combustion as applied to gel 
fuels in Section 6 . These models (for example Ref. [25] ) use the fre- 
quency of oscillatory vaporization of the droplet to account for the 
behavior of the gellant layer formed around the fuel vapor pocket

Fig. 58.  Prediction of linear stability analyses of viscoelastic liquids in response to varicose ( n m = 0) and sinusoidal ( n m = 1) surface wave disturbances parameterized by

in  the  latter  stages  of  gel  droplet  vaporization  (see  for  example 
Refs. [ 23 , 24 ]). Any viscoelastic models are not used and the com- 
bined inﬂuence of temperature and shear/stretch is not considered 
in the current generation of droplet combustion models. 

Vaporization of gel droplet is characterized by ejections of va- 
por  jets  from  the  ruptured  surface  of  the  droplet  composed  of 
gellant layer [ 23 , 24 ]. It can be argued that the behavior of a gel 
droplet retaining residual viscoelastic properties should be similar 
to an unstable viscoelastic bubble as a ﬁrst approximation, for ex- 
ample polymer-shelled bubbles considered by Lee and Lee [210] , 
and should be affected by temperature, shear and elastic moduli of 
the gellant layer, and the ratio of droplet radius and shell thickness. 
The  droplet  is  subject  to  pressure  differential  across  the  gellant 
layer  surface.  Breakdown  of  surface  continuity  could  thus  result 
from a ﬁnite shear modulus and breakdown in the elastic structure 
of the gellant layer, leading to nucleation of a hole on the surface. 
Studies on this aspect of the gellant layer or shell are required to 
realistically model the dynamics of a vaporizing gel droplet. 

4.9. Surface tension and rheology 

Surface  tension  is  an  important  physicochemical  property 
of  gel  propellants  used  in  modeling  (see  Sections  4.6.2 ,  4.8.2 , 
4.8.3 ,  and  5.10 )  and  data  reduction  of  atomization  experiments 
( Sections  5.5.5  and  5.8 ).  Several  researchers  attempted  to  mea- 
sure  the  surface  tension  of  gel  propellants  and  their  simulants 
[ 47 , 52 , 126 , 132 , 166 , 171 , 211-213 ],  often  with  mixed  results.  Goldin 
et al. [126] heated the gels to an elevated temperature to destroy 
their  structure  temporarily  and  enable  the  measurement  of  sur- 

face tension. Extrapolation to room temperature gave the surface 
tension estimate for the gel. However, this procedure could be ap- 
plied only for xylene-MPA 60 and mineral spirit-MPA 60 gels and 
the estimated gel surface tensions (32.5 and 26 mN/m) are very 
close to the equilibrium surface tensions of the liquids (29 mN/m 
for xylene and ∼25 mN/m for mineral spirit at 15 °C). Padwal and 
Mishra [52] used the Wilhelmy plate method for mildly sheared 
Jet A1-Thixatrol ST-xylene gel fuel to estimate the surface tension 
equal to 23 mN/m, again, close to that of Jet A1 (28.6 mN/m at 
15 °C). Wilhelmy plate method has also been used by Negri et al. 
[211] for many Boger ﬂuids and by Mallory and Sojka for water-A- 
A gels [171] . 

However, Wilhelmy plate and du Nouy ring methods were not 
useful for water-HPC and Cekol gels [171] , and for water-Carbopol 
gels [47] . This could be due to the stickiness of the gels in case 
of  the  ring  [171] ,  lack  of  contact  of  yield  stress  ﬂuids  with  the 
surface  in  case  of  plate  [171] ,  and  due  to  the  elasticity  of  gels 
in case of ring and plate [47] . Thus, rheological properties might 
introduce  diﬃculties  in  the  measurement  of  surface  tension  of 
gels. 

Connell  et  al.  [213]  followed  the  method  reported  by  Boujlel 
and Coussot [212] for measuring the surface tension of dodecane- 
silica  and  dodecane-silica-NaBH 
4  gels  and  found  that  while  the 
surface tension of dodecane-silica gel was close to that of dode- 
4 substantially increased the surface tension 
cane, addition of NaBH 
of resulting gel. The measurements of Boujlel and Coussot [212] in- 
dicate  that  the  surface  tensions  of  water-Carbopol  gels  (which 
showed yield stress) were 10 % smaller than water. These results 
corroborate the ﬁndings of Baek et al. [47] , which are discussed 
now.

Fig. 59.  (a) Comparison of the surface tension of water-Carbopol 934 gel measured by the pendant drop-Laplace-Young equation method [47] with the yield stress [51] and 
(b) scatter plot of the surface tensions of liquids and corresponding gels using a number of methods. See the text for other details. 

In their search for a suitable method to estimate the surface 
tension of water-Carbopol-TEA gels, Baek et al. [47] attempted to 
use the pendant drop method along with Young-Laplace equation 
and image processing. Gels containing SUS304 did not form drops. 
In a separate study, Baek and Kim [51] also estimated the yield 
stress of these gels using the HB model (see Fig. 30 a and related 
description in Section 4.3 ). Results of these two studies are com- 
piled in Fig. 59 a in which, we observe an abrupt decrease in the 
surface tension of unloaded gels and attendant rise of yield stress 
for Y G  > 0.15 %. The range of measured surface tension for Y G  ≤
0.15 % (63-69 mN/m) is also close to that of water (72.8 mN/m), 
qualitatively similar observation to  the previous observations for 
other gel systems noted above. 

Baek et al. [47] also observed the wetting behavior of a num- 
ber of liquids on the unsheared gel for Y G = 0.35 % and attempted 
to bracket the surface tension of gel between that of the wetting 
liquids. They succeeded in obtaining the lower bound much higher 
than the pendant drop estimate. Thus, pendant drop method ap- 
parently suffers from the inﬂuence of yield stress [47] . The linear 
ﬁt for Y G = 0-0.15 % was therefore extrapolated to Y G = 0.35 % and 
used  in  subsequent  analysis.  The  backlit  images  of  drops  shown 
alongside the data in Fig. 59 a reveal that elongated droplets are 
produced for higher Y G , possibly due to the elasticity of gel. In re- 
lation to the error prone measurements of surface tension by the 
pendant  drop  method,  it  should  be  noted  here  that  Rahimi  and 
Weihs [166] obtained the surface tension of water-0.3 % Carbopol 
gel  (77  mN/m)  close  to  water  (72.8  mN/m).  Unfortunately,  they 
have not speciﬁed the measurement method and further exami- 
nation is not possible. 

Caliman  et  al.  [214]  used  another  approach  based  on  the  du 
Nouy ring method for measuring the interfacial tension between 
a  Carbopol  based  gel  and  Newtonian  castor  oil,  especially  when 
the gel is classiﬁed as a yield stress ﬂuid. The gel was placed un- 
der the Newtonian ﬂuid to avoid deformation of the interface. Mo- 
tion of the ring in the gel required an extra force over and above 
the yield stress. This force should be used to estimate the interfa- 

cial tension otherwise; the yield stress contribution would lead to 
an over-estimation of the interfacial tension [214] . Caliman et al. 
[214]  avoided  the  elasticity  effects  by  keeping  the  characteristic 
shear rate due to the motion of ring much higher than the critical 
shear rate corresponding to the yield stress. These results suggest 
that the yield stress effects are likely to be additive for the interfa- 
cial tension measurements. 

Estimates of the surface tension by different methods and for 
different gels are compared against the surface tension of liquids 
used in the gel formulation in Fig. 59 b. The closeness between the 
values for liquids and their gels can be observed in a number of 
systems compiled in Fig. 59 b. However, no systematic studies have 
been carried out to explain the observed trends and identiﬁcation 
of sources of uncertainty remains to be done. For example, infor- 
mation regarding the additivity of the rheological effects in terms 
of  the  contributions  due  to  viscosity,  yield  stress,  elasticity,  and 
thixotropy is lacking. Similarly, the contribution of liquid in deter- 
mining the surface tension of a highly sheared gel is also unknown 
at  present.  Studies  by  Baek  et  al.  [47]  and  Caliman  et  al.  [214] , 
among others could be a useful starting point to segregate the ef- 
fects of elasticity and yield stress, provided the gels are properly 
classiﬁed and their rheological state is comprehensively character- 
ized prior to the measurement of surface tension. 

Above description pertains to the estimation of equilibrium sur- 
face  tension.  Another  issue  with  the  use  of  surface  tension  is 
the need to distinguish between dynamic and equilibrium surface 
tension,  chieﬂy  because  the  gels  capable  of  being  atomized  are 
usually highly sheared. Thus, major portion of the gel fragments 
would have almost fully yielded, although the residual elastic ef- 
fects might still linger. Since atomization involves the creation of 
a new surface, the notion of surface age applies to the gel frag- 
ments undergoing breakup and estimation of dynamic surface ten- 
sion might have to be considered. Baek et al. [47] suggest that the 
surface age is usually very small, ∼2 ms for typical impinging jet 
atomizers. Some oscillating droplet techniques might be applicable 
for this purpose in some cases.

variations of the ﬁrst-mode slosh force damping ratio against the viscosity parameter. 

Unlike Oh and Re gen  for which the dependence on rheological 
state is inherent in deﬁnition, the Weber number ( We ) is almost 
exclusively assumed independent of the rheological state of the gel. 
This could be an acceptable approximation if used for the highly 
sheared gel. It is therefore advisable to estimate the surface tension 
of gel once it is brought to the rheological state existing prior to 
atomization when correlating spray data with We . 

4.10. Sloshing dynamics and rheology 

Sloshing is the transient motion of a free liquid surface in re- 
sponse to the external disturbances such as lateral and vertical dis- 
placement and spin/rotational motions imparted to the tank. It is 
a very important consideration for stability and control of space 
vehicles [215] . It is expected that sloshing would be reduced with 
gel propellants, in line with the known effect of viscous damping 
on sloshing [216] . The initial interest in gelation of LH 
2  and LO 
2 
used for large launch vehicles and boosters also resulted in inves- 
tigations on the quantiﬁcation of sloshing dynamics for gel propel- 
lants and the sloshing of thixotropic ﬂuids [217] and pseudoplastic 
gels [76] have been investigated. We discuss the available results 
on the sloshing of viscous ﬂuids [216] and pseudoplastic gels [76] . 
Sumner  and  Stofan  [216]  investigated  the  effects  if  viscous 
damping  on  the  ﬁrst-mode  sloshing  force  parameter,  F s / ( ρg D 3 ) 
and  damping  ratio,  F s,n / F 
s, ( n +1 ) between  two  successive  cycles  n 
and  ( n + 1)  of  sinusoidal  disturbances.  Viscous  Newtonian  liquids 
were  chosen  such  that  the  kinematic  viscosity  varied  in  the 
range υ = 1.14 × 10 −7 -1.1 × 10 −3  m 2 /s. Spherical tanks of diameter 
D = 0.24-0.81 m and having one degree of motion in the horizon- 
tal plane were either installed on ball bearings or suspended. They 
were subjected to sinusoidal disturbances of amplitude A = 0.254- 
0.79 cm and frequency ω = 0-20 Hz. It should be noted that the 
usual range of frequencies of interest in horizontal sloshing is 1- 
5  Hz.  This  range  is  also  suggested  by  the  time-series  of  slosh 
amplitude in yaw of the Saturn I [215] , which indicates a domi- 
nant frequency ∼1.5 Hz. Moreover, fundamental slosh frequencies 
at  the  lift-off are  ≤ 1  Hz  [215] .  All  the  tanks  used  by  Sumner 
and Stofan were kept 50 % full. Under these experimental condi- 
tions, only the ﬁrst mode was dominant after the disturbance was 
quickly stopped. The measured ﬁrst-mode horizontal sloshing force 
and damping ratios were correlated with the viscosity parameter, 
ν/ ( g D 3 ) 

, as shown in Fig. 60 . 

0 . 5 

Fig. 60 a shows that the measured slosh force continuously de- 
creases with an increase in the viscosity parameter, such that vis- 
cous damping is responsible for a reduction in the peak of ﬁrst- 
mode slosh force. It was also found that the natural frequencies of 
oscillations induced in the liquid surface were independent of vis- 
cosity. Further, the effectiveness of viscosity in reducing the ﬁrst- 

57 

mode slosh force diminished as the tank diameter and amplitude 
of excitation were increased. First-mode damping ratios were also 
found to be independent of the amplitude of excitation and they 
increased with increase in viscosity or decrease in tank diameter, 
as can be observed from Fig. 60 b. Both the parameters are accom- 
modated in the viscosity parameter. 

Price et al. [76] adopted the methodology of Sumner and Sto- 
fan  [216]  for  water,  water-0.27  %  Carbopol  940  gel,  and  water- 
5.2 % silica gel propellant simulants. In their investigations, Price 
et al. [76] identiﬁed three modes of slosh, two of which are illus- 
trated in Fig. 61 a. For this purpose, a spherical tank ( 1 ) of diameter, 
D = 0.457 m was suspended by two cables ( 2 ). A hydraulic actua- 
tor ( 3 ) measured the force per unit deﬂection ( F (cid:3) 
s ) once a prede- 
termined sinusoidal disturbance imparted using an electrodynamic 
exciter ( 4 ) was stopped. The experimental arrangement is shown in 
Fig. 61 b. Slosh was characterized by frequency ( f ), motion of ﬂuid 
(mode shape), and the decay of oscillations (damping). The mea- 
surements of F (cid:3) 
s are plotted against f in Figs. 61 c and 61 d for tanks 
70 % and 30 % full, respectively. The volumes of contained ﬂuids 
roughly correspond to the conditions during lift-off and ﬂight. We 
have shown them here in the dimensionless forms identiﬁed by 
Sumner and Stofan [216] . The peaks of the slosh force observed 
from the response curves of three ﬂuids correspond to the slosh 
mode frequencies because the effective mass of tank and ﬂuid are 
maximum at these frequencies [76] . Individual frequencies and the 
corresponding modes are listed in Figs. 61 c and 61 d. Damping of 
the slosh modes could be judged from the height of the peaks. 

Price et al. [76] noted that water behaved in accordance with 
the classical theories while the gel propellant simulants behaved 
very differently from water as well as from each other. In partic- 
ular, the fundamental slosh frequencies and damping in the slosh 
modes were higher in gels due to purely viscous effects. Slosh mo- 
tion (mode shape) was also different. The Carbopol gel did not ex- 
hibit typical pendulum-like motion of a ﬂuid sloshing in a spher- 
ical tank in the fundamental mode and instead, the ﬂuid motion 
at the walls was very damped [76] . Fluid in the center moved op- 
posite to the ﬂuid along the side of the tank. The particulate sil- 
ica gel exhibited pendulum-like motion in addition to the motion 
observed in organic Carbopol gel [76] . The less signiﬁcant higher 
slosh modes of the gels were also dissimilar from water, character- 
ized by a circular and horizontal motion in the absence of vertical 
displacement. 

It was found that the damping was very fast in gels; in partic- 
ular, sloshing continued in water for 30-40 cycles after the exci- 
tation was stopped, compared to 1-2 cycles for Carbopol gel and 
almost instantaneous damping (i.e. within one cycle) for silica gel. 
Price et al. [76] also employed vibrations ( ω > 5 Hz) in addi- 
tion to excitation in some tests to induce shear thinning and also

to create conditions where thixotropic effects could inﬂuence the 
slosh  behavior.  However,  no  signiﬁcant  effects  of  shear  thinning 
and thixotropy were observed in these tests. 

Bond  number,  Bo = ( ρg r 2 ) /σ based  on  the  tank  radius  ( r ),  as 
well  as  the  appropriately  deﬁned  Weber  and  Reynolds  numbers 
have been used extensively in the analysis of sloshing dynamics 
[215] . However, above investigations on gel propellants have not 
characterized their results in terms of these dimensionless groups. 

5. Atomization of gel propellants 

Atomization of the bulk liquid jet results in a large number of 
droplets of different sizes. Conversion into droplets increases the 
surface area and consequently improves the rate of vaporization, 
mixing,  and  combustion  [218] .  Viscosity,  apart  from  surface  ten- 
sion, is a stabilizing force that opposes the breakup of liquid jets 
into droplets, mainly by delaying the breakup via dissipation of en- 
ergy supplied for atomization and by suppressing instabilities on 
the liquid surface [218] . Lefebvre and McDonell [218] discuss many 
types of atomizers and spray properties. Incidentally, gel propel- 
lants  are  highly  viscous  and  atomizing  them  into  a  spray  of  re- 
quired droplet size is a signiﬁcant challenge, at least in some cases. 
Therefore, the breakup of gel propellants and their simulants has 
received considerable attention in literature as evident in Fig. 2 . 

The basic strategy in gel propellant atomization is to reduce the 
propellant viscosity as much as possible prior to atomization. Sig- 
niﬁcant amount of work in this area utilized the conventional im- 
pinging jet atomizers for this purpose, while some experimental 
programs identiﬁed atomizer designs inherently better suited for 
gel  propellants.  Topics  covered  under  gel  propellant  atomization 
are depicted schematically in Fig. 62 . Evidently, the effects of rhe- 
ology require consideration in primary and secondary atomization 
in terms of the properties of sheared gels. 

Fig. 62.  Overview of studies relevant for gel propellant atomization. 

In  this  section,  we  begin  with  a  description  of  the  atomiza- 
tion  methods  demonstrated  for  gel  propellants  and  their  simu- 
lant  ﬂuids.  Conventional  methods,  their  improvements,  and  en- 
tirely  novel  approaches  are  considered  here.  We  also  focus  on 
the  breakup  mechanisms  and  the  effects  of  gel  rheology  on  the 
breakup. Breakup and atomization data on selected ﬂuids are com- 
piled and discussed. Theoretical and numerical analyses of atom- 
ization are presented.

These  studies  were  done  using  essentially  the  same  experimen- 
tal arrangements and injector designs on different gels. Syed et al. 
[39] show that the Carbopol gels produced smaller droplets than 
water, while Ramasubramanian et al. [81] show that the breakup 
lengths ( L 
b ) of Carbopol-Cabosil hybrid gels were smaller than wa- 
ter. These are not however isolated cases of the behavior of gels 
and Goldin et al. [126] previously made similar observations for 
plain oriﬁce jets of gels. 

5.2. Other conventional atomizers 

Figs. 63c-63e show "two-ﬂuid" conventional atomization meth- 
ods considered for gel propellants that rely on the kinetic energy 
of propellant jet or second jet of atomizing air. Some form of mix- 
ing between the two phases is inherent in the two-ﬂuid atomiz- 
ers. Like the triplet impinging jets, mixing also results in the two- 
ﬂuid case from the intense turbulence created by the contact of 
two phases. 

Conventional  two-ﬂuid  atomizers  used  on  the  gel  propel- 
lants  and  their  simulants  mainly  belong  to  the  airblast  atom- 
izers  ( Fig.  63 c)  [ 27 , 102 , 103 , 127 , 157 , 232-236 ],  although  ultrasonic 
( Fig. 63 d) [103] and effervescent atomizer [ 195 , 237 ] have also been 
shown to be effective in the atomization of gels and viscoelastic 
ﬂuids, respectively. Fig. 63 e shows a commercial two-ﬂuid atom- 
izer used by Guglielmi [102] and Urbon [103] for atomization and 
ramjet combustion experiments on boron carbide (B 
4 C)-JP-10 gel 
slurry fuel. This atomizer includes a swirling liquid phase, inter- 
nal mixing, and ability to achieve primary and secondary breakup 
by  the  time  the  liquid  exits  the  atomizer.  Recently,  quintuplet- 
impinging jets have been used for hypergolic gels [ 26 , 213 , 227 ]. Re- 
lated developments in slurry fuels are also of interest to the at- 
omization of gel propellants, and atomizers used in NACA studies 
[60] and by Caton and Kihm [238] could prove useful in some sit- 
uations. 

Some important distinguishing features of the mixing and im- 
pinging methods are compared in Fig. 64 . The contacting patterns 
differ between the impinging and mixing type atomizers. Triplet 
and doublet atomizers rely on the impingement of two ﬂuid jets 
while they ﬂow parallel to each other in the coaxial atomizer (such 
that liquid jet is surrounded by annular high-speed air jet) [239] . 
In both types, the kinetic energy of ﬂuids is utilized to create an 
instability in the bulk jet, followed by its growth and breakup of 
jet into ligaments and droplets. Therefore, an essential requirement 
of these atomizers is the need for high-velocity ﬂuids and conse- 
quently high pressure drops. In this respect, coaxial atomizers re- 
quire higher upstream pressure than the impinging jets because of 
the limited interfacial contact [239] . 

Table 17 summarizes the current work using conventional at- 
omizers other than impinging jets and Table 18 gives a separate 
summary for the plain oriﬁce atomizers. We now discuss the im- 
portant results obtained using these atomization methods. 

5.2.1. Plain oriﬁce atomization 

Plain  oriﬁce  forms  a  capillary  jet  of  ﬂuid.  Plain  oriﬁce  atom- 
ization  of  non-Newtonian  ﬂuids  is  extensively  studied,  consider- 
ing the practical importance of these ﬂuids in ink-jet printing and 
other applications. The reader is directed to specialized reviews in 
this area [ 241 , 242 ]. In this section, we illustrate the main features 
of the problem and discuss some interesting results obtained on 
the capillary jets of viscoelastic ﬂuids [191] , gels [ 39 , 81 , 126 ], and 
slurries [ 243 , 244 ] with reference to the observations summarized 
in Table 18 . 

A striking outcome of the studies by Goldin et al. [191] is the 
ﬁnding that water is more stable than Carbopol gel even though 
the gel is more viscous. A similar result was recently obtained by 
Ramasubramanian  et  al.  [81]  using  Carbopol-Cabosil  hybrid  gels.

nally impinging (“like-on-like”) jets, (b) triplet impinging jets, (c) coaxial airblast

5.1. Impinging jets atomization 

As the name suggests, multiple jets with pre-selected and care- 
j ) impinge on each other to achieve atom- 

fully timed velocities ( u 
ization in this very common method in rocket engines. 

5.1.1. Doublet impinging jets 

Fig.  63 a  shows  the  contacting  pattern  for  doublet  impinging 
jets. Many such doublets can be required depending upon the scale 
of operation (engine power, ﬂow rates, and mixing requirements) 
[33] , resulting in increased complexity [218] . The like-on-like con- 
ﬁguration uses the same gel propellant in both jets of the doublet. 
It is also possible to use a matched fuel and oxidizer jet in a pair, 
as done typically for hypergolic propellants. 

Impinging  jet  atomization  of  single-ﬂuid  (like-on-like  dou- 
blet)  is  the  commonest  method  for  gel  propellants  and 
[ 27 , 33 , 35 , 36 , 39-41 , 45-48 , 50 , 77 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 90 , 105- 
their  simulants 
107 , 109 , 114 , 115 , 135 , 159 , 164 , 171 , 211 , 213 , 219-224 , 226-230 ].  Salient 
data  from  the  selected  studies  are  summarized  in  Table  16 . 
Detailed lists appear in the Supplementary Material. 

5.1.2. Triplet impinging jets 

Fig. 63 b shows the triplet conﬁguration in which a centrally lo- 
cated jet of propellant is impinged upon by the two jets of oxidizer 
(air). This is the commonly used triplet conﬁguration in gel propel- 
lant atomization [ 17 , 46 , 82 , 127 , 213 , 227 ]. From the limited available 
data on one water gel [231] , it appears that the triplet impinging 
jets  tend  to  produce  the  ﬁnest  droplets  (in  terms  of  the  Sauter 
mean  diameter,  D 32 )  among  the  doublet,  triplet,  and  quadruplet 
impinging  jets.  Information  on  these  studies  is  also  compiled  in 
Table 16 . 

According to the data given in Table 16 , doublet and triplet in- 
jectors have been used for atomization and combustion of gel pro- 
pellants. They are useful for gels, provided higher pressure drops 
(or jet velocities) than base liquids are employed. Interesting cases 
include those of Syed et al. [39] and Ramasubramanian et al. [81] .

Such ﬁndings have also been obtained by Golding et al. [126] in 
their later work on particulate gels as observed in Table 18 . Exper- 
imental and numerical studies of Schetz and coworkers [ 243 , 244 ] 
on the perturbed slurry jets shed light on the effects of particle 
size and motion on the surface dynamics and breakup times. Re- 
cent effort s on plain oriﬁce atomization of gels [ 39 , 81 ] considered 
the parametric effects of oriﬁce geometry on the surface dynamics 
and stability of jets and sheets. Results of the two relevant studies 
are illustrated in Fig. 65 . 

Goldin  et  al.  [ 126 , 191 ]  found  that  jets  of  weakly  viscoelastic 
ﬂuids  broke  up  after  forming  a  series  of  droplets  connected  by 
threads, the beads-on-a-string (boas) structure shown in Fig. 65 a. 
No well-deﬁned surface waves appeared on the tested viscoelas- 
tic ﬂuids even at low concentrations, while the jets of Newtonian 
(water)  and  inelastic  non-Newtonian  (water-Carbopol  934)  ﬂuids 
broke up due to the usual exponential growth in the amplitude of 
constant-wavelength surface waves. On the other hand, other par- 
ticulate silica gels broke up after turbulence accompanied by the 
distortion of jet surface such that the resulting fragments were ir- 
regular and randomly located as shown in Fig. 65 b. Surface mor- 
phologies  of  perturbed  slurry  jets  in  Figs.  65c-65e  reveal  their 
breakup mechanism. 

5.2.2. Airblast atomization 

Mansour and Chigier [157] comprehensively characterized the 
atomization of shear thinning, extension thinning, as well as ex- 
tension thickening ﬂuids using a coaxial airblast atomizer coupled 
to an extensional viscometer. They investigated the effects of rheol- 
ogy on breakup, droplet size measurements, correlations with GLR , 
Ohnesorge number ( Oh ), and Weber number ( We ). Urbon [103] re- 
ported that the ramjet combustion of droplets produced by the air- 
blast atomizer was weak and unsteady, even though the atomiza- 
tion itself was satisfactory. 

5.2.3. Pressure swirl atomization 

Yang et al. [160] attempted the pressure swirl atomization of 
polysaccharide-water gel simulants in the pressure drop range 0.2- 
1.6 MPa. As shown in Fig. 66 , they could obtain a typical hollow 
sheet created by the air core, for both water and the gel, and found 
a gradual decrease in the breakup length at higher injection pres- 
sures, in common with Newtonian ﬂuids. Fig. 66 a and 66 b show 
that it is relatively diﬃcult to form a swirling sheet of gel in com- 
parison to water. While a fully developed spray cone was observed 
in  case  of  water  at  this  pressure  drop,  only  a  helically  unstable 
circular jet could form in the case of gel. Correspondingly higher 
pressure drops were then employed to form the swirling sheets as 
shown in Figs. 66 c and 66 d for given atomizer dimensions.

Some  of  their  observations  on  the  effects  of  rheology  on  the 
breakup of these ﬂuids and breakup structures would be discussed 
in Section 5.7 . 

Guan et al. [245] have proposed using a centrifugal swirl noz- 
zle for the atomization of ammonium dinitramide (ADN) based gel 
monopropellant. They experimentally determined the spray prop- 
erties such as spray cone angle, breakup length, and droplet size 
distributions.

atomizers for atomization and combustion of JP-10-B 
A sketch of the ultrasonic atomizer is shown in Fig. 63 d, in which 
the  impingement  of  a  supersonic  airstream  produces  a  standing 
shock wave. Liquid is introduced in cross ﬂow to the expanding 
airstream for atomization by the shock wave. Ultrasonic atomizer 
produced similar droplet size as the airblast atomizer at a much 
lower pressure drop for all the tested conditions. Given suﬃciently 
high ﬂow rates of the atomizing air, the pressure drops were usu- 
ally smaller than a comparable airblast atomizer. Urbon [103] also 
cited large oriﬁce size as a useful feature of this atomizer to reduce 
the clogging. He also observed a steady combustion of the gelled 
slurry fuel. 

5.2.5. Effervescent atomization 

Effervescent  atomization  of  gels  has  not  been  reported  but 
Geckler  and  Sojka  [195]  studied  the  atomization  of  viscoelastic 
polymeric solutions of water and glycerin using polyethylene oxide 
(PEO) in a conventional effervescent atomizer shown in Fig. 67 a. 
Resulting  solutions  had  viscosity  of  0.011-0.018  Pa.s  in  the  low 
shear range and relaxation times in the range 10 −3 -10 −7 s. 

Addition of PEO resulted in an annular ﬂow of liquid and re- 
tarded the formation of ligaments. This latter effect caused thicker 
ligaments  and  adversely  affected  their  growth,  leading  to  larger 
Sauter mean diameters ( D 32 ) than the non-polymeric base solution. 
Overall structure of the near-nozzle spray in Fig. 67 b for a partic- 
ular case is representative of these thick and long ligaments. How-

Unfortunately,  the  atomizer  was  unable  to  produce  droplets 
from  the  sheets,  even  at  these  high  injection  pressures,  and  in- 
stead, a sheet with relatively long breakup length appeared. The 
smallest breakup fragments shown in the inset of Fig. 66 c were 
characterized as ’ﬂoccules’ or tangled mass of gel fragments [160] .

ever, the achieved droplet sizes shown in Figs. 67 c and 67 d sug- 
gest that they are still comparable to the expected performance of 
effervescent atomizer at characteristically low gas-liquid mass ra- 
tios ( GLR ), notwithstanding the distinct effect of molecular weight 
( MW ) of PEO in terms of the increased diﬃculty of atomization. 
Effervescent  atomization  of  gel  propellants  should  be  studied  in 
greater detail and experimental studies on combustion should also 
be taken up. 

Relevant to the atomization of gel propellants and their simu- 
lants is the use of solid fuel slurries, coal-water slurries being the 
most prominent example used along with conventional fuels such 
as diesel. Many studies on coal-water-diesel atomization have been 
performed, for instance, using the positive displacement and ac- 
cumulator fuel injection systems in diesel engines [ 246 , 247 ]. Abu- 
Qudais and Okasha [232] worked with a modiﬁed airblast atomizer 
for spraying an olive-cake and diesel slurry. 

5.3. Improved atomization methods 

In  the  preceding  sections,  shear  and  elongational  viscosity  of 
the gel is shown to limit the quality of atomization from conven- 
tional  atomizers  in  terms  of  the  delayed  breakup  and  increased 
droplet  sizes.  A  method  to  improve  atomization  quality  involves 
improvement  of  the  atomizer  designs  and  overcome  the  viscous 
resistance of gel propellants by changing the contacting/ﬂow pat- 
terns.  Some  of  these  improved  methods  of  atomization  are  pre- 
sented in Fig. 68 and are discussed subsequently. 

5.3.1. Direct ﬂow perturbation 

Sutherland  et  al.  [248]  introduced  perturbation  in  the  two- 
phase ﬂow developed in an effervescent atomizer by inserting a 
porous  disc  (pore  diameter  37  μm,  porosity  49  %)  upstream  of 
the exit oriﬁce. Liquids ranging in viscosities 0.001-0.08 Pa.s and 
surface tension in the 72-30 mN/m range were sprayed using the 
atomizer. The resulting ’ligament-controlled effervescent atomizer’ 

performed  to  yield  droplets  of  D 32  <  70  μm  for  GLR  <  0.01. 
Fig. 68 a shows the design and ﬂow paths. It would appear that the 
two-phase ﬂow pattern developed without a porous insert would 
consist of an air core surrounded by the liquid phase. Sutherland 
et al. [248] suggest that the porous disc reduced the ligament di- 
ameter while maintaining the same basic two-phase ﬂow pattern. 
Another key feature of this atomizer is the relative insensitivity of 
the droplet sizes to the viscosity of liquid. 

In  another  example  of  direct  ﬂow  perturbation,  Chernov  and 
Natan [21] used two counter-rotating wheels as shown in Fig. 68 b 
to reduce the ﬂow area of a round jet of water-Carbopol gel sim- 
ulant at a frequency 0.1-1.1 kHz and constant amplitude. External 
perturbation in this manner resulted in the destabilization of the 
jet prior to its impingement by two air jets in a triplet conﬁgura- 
tion. It signiﬁcantly improved the atomization quality by reducing 
the D 32 by 25-60 %. While their method of introducing disturbance 
to the ﬂow is diﬃcult to adopt in practice, it shows that ﬂow per- 
turbation could be useful to overcome the viscous (rheological) re- 
sistance of gels and give an improved performance of the atomizer 
as discussed in Section 5.9.3 . 

Yang and coworkers suggested using a leaf spring [249] in the 
conventional pressure swirl atomizer to atomize a polysaccharide- 
water gel simulant. However, they report that the perturbation us- 
ing the leaf spring did not appreciably improve the spray quality. 

5.3.2. Aerodynamic ﬂow perturbation 

Yang and coworkers also suggested a jet-driven Helmholtz os- 
cillator  [134]  to  perturb  the  ﬂow  of  a  polysaccharide-water  gel 
simulant  jet  and  improve  the  atomization  quality  of  a  conven- 
tional impinging jet doublet positioned downstream of the oscilla- 
tor. Their conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 68 c. However, the breakup 
structures in case of the jet-driven Helmholtz oscillator (based on 
a previous work by Morel [252] ) are same as the ones observed in 
case of the conventional impinging jets [48] . Inclusion of the os- 
cillator in the ﬂow path of the jets was observed to reduce the

breakup  lengths  of  sheets  [134] .  However,  effect  on  the  droplet 
sizes could not be investigated because the disturbance generated 
by the oscillator did not achieve complete breakup of the gel. 

Under certain conditions, non-circular liquid jets are known to 
be more unstable than their circular counterparts [253-255] . Con- 
sidering this possibility, Yang et al. [48] initially explored the use 
of square impinging jets on the polysaccharide-water gel simulant 
along with linear stability analysis. Only a slight increase in the 
dominant growth rate was predicted by linear stability analysis of 
sheets obtained with square jets. Additional studies on the non- 
circular impinging jets involving gel simulants were also reported 
by Fu et al. [250] and Zhao et al. [251] . The conﬁgurations used 
in these studies are shown in Fig. 68 d. In comparison to the cir- 
cular jet of same cross-sectional area, the square and elliptical jets 
produced more unstable sheets upon impingement. This was at- 
tributed to the onset of instability in the individual jets prior to 
impingement. Here, diﬃculty in working with misaligned jets also 
needs to be considered. In fact, the use of deliberate perturbation 
of jet in a doublet impinging jet atomizer is likely to be counter- 
productive because two perturbed (and hence misaligned) jets are 
unlikely to impinge at a ﬁxed point, or impinge with unequal pre- 
impingement lengths. Mismatched and uncontrolled resultant mo- 
mentum of the perturbed impinging jets in a pair can lead to an 
incompletely atomized and poorly mixed ﬂuid consisting of multi- 
ple coarse breakup structures. 

5.3.3. Internal impingement 

A two-ﬂuid atomizer using the ﬂow ﬁeld of multiple internally 
impinging  microjets  of  air  has  been  studied  extensively  by  Pad- 
wal and Mishra for atomization [ 49 , 52 , 110 , 111 ] and combustion of 

Jet A1 gel propellants [56] . In this atomizer, multiple (8) microjets 
of air are formed at relatively low injection pressure ( ∼0.2 MPa 
[ 49 , 52 ]) and made to impinge on each other in a region near the 
conical end of the inner tube used for delivering gel fuel. 

Narrow conﬁnement and impingement creates a sustained vor- 
tical ﬂow ﬁeld that continuously interacts with the incoming gel. 
It has been found that this arrangement leads to the formation of 
thin ﬁlm of the gel at the periphery of the oriﬁce [52] . The ﬁlm is 
usually discontinuous and consists of thin longitudinally oriented 
ligaments and droplets of the size of ligament diameter. It has been 
shown that the Sauter mean diameters as small as 50 μm can be 
obtained from this method at relatively low GLR s [ 52 , 111 ]. More- 
over,  the  method  is  shown  to  work  equally  well  on  Jet  A1  and 
to some extent on water [110] . It seems to be limited by the sur- 
face tension because surface tension of water (72 mN/m) is much 
higher than Jet A1 (28 mN/m). 

5.3.4. Other methods 

Rahimi et al. [26] used pentad-type atomizer (four oxidizer jets 
impinging on a centrally located jet of gel fuel) for hypergolic com- 
bustion of gel hydrazine/IRFNA and gel MMH/IRFNA pairs. Thomp- 
son and Rothstein [256] used ﬂat fan and hollow-cone spray noz- 
zles for wormlike micelle solutions of CTAB and sodium salicylate 
(NaSal) in deionized water. Their experiments show that unstable 
thin  sheets  of  viscoelastic  ﬂuids  could  be  produced  using  these 
nozzles. 

Gel propellants invariably contain particles and their agglomer- 
ation during storage could give rise to larger particulates and pos- 
sibility of clogging of the atomizer oriﬁce. Uninterrupted atomiza- 
tion of a gel would therefore require careful design of the gel pro-

pellant in terms of particle size distribution so that the particles 
are  small  enough  to  pass  through  the  oriﬁce  and  form  droplets 
of prescribed sizes downstream. A well-designed atomizer for gel 
propellant should account for this possibility and means should be 
provided to condition the particle size by breaking the agglomer- 
ates upstream of the atomizer if needed. This is a known issue in 
coal-water slurry fuels of very high coal particle loading and has 
been addressed, for example by introduction of a kinetic mill close 
to the atomizer [257] . 

5.4. Breakup mechanisms 

Externally  impinging  jets  of  the  type  shown  in  Fig.  63 a  are 
the most commonly used atomizers in gel propellant atomization. 
Hence, the breakup of gels in these injectors is discussed ﬁrst, fol- 
lowed by other atomizers. Detailed discussion on different breakup 
regimes governed by one of the breakup mechanisms described in 
this section appears in Section 5.5 . 

5.4.1. Sheet breakup 

Atomization by externally impinging jets begins with the for- 
mation of a thin sheet, followed by an instability in the sheet at 
its  periphery  or  the  interior  surface,  ligament  formation,  and  ﬁ- 
nally droplet generation from multiple ligament breakup events. A 
leaf-shaped  sheet  appears  at  very  low  velocities  of  the  two  jets 
and practically useful breakup regimes develop at higher jet veloci- 
ties, with the most common breakup regimes such as impact wave 
and sheetless atomization possible at much higher jet velocities. 
Newtonian and non-Newtonian sheets have been widely studied, 
for example [ 258 , 259 ] and above general mechanism of the sheet 
breakup applies equally well to either type of ﬂuids. Flat fan spray 
nozzles produce a ﬂat sheet, while pressure-swirl and hollow cone 
spray nozzles produce a conical sheet of the liquid to be atomized. 

5.4.2. Film breakup 

Some atomizers like the internally impinging atomizer [ 49 , 52 ] 
produce a ﬁlm bounded by the oriﬁce walls. This ﬁlm breaks up 
near the exit of oriﬁce. Fig. 69 shows snapshots of this ﬁlm for Jet 
A1-Thixatrol ST-xylene gel propellant. 

It is observed that the ﬁlm is discontinuous and a signiﬁcant 
amount of gel is actually already distributed as longitudinally ori- 
ented ligaments. These breakup structures very near the exit plane 

of atomizer suggest that the breakup of gel begins within the at- 
omizer body itself. Droplets are also observed in the same region. 
This mechanism is also similar to the ligament-controlled efferves- 
cent atomization observed at low GLR s by Sutherland et al. [248] . 
However, as shown in Fig. 69 , ligaments are observed in the inter- 
nally impinging atomizer at higher GLR s also, unlike the efferves- 
cent atomizer. 

5.4.3. Prompt breakup 

Sheet  or  ﬁlm  breakup  of  gel  propellants is  a  gradual  process 
since  the  jets  are  broken  up  into  droplets  through  the  interme- 
diate  steps  involving  sheet  and  ligaments.  According  to  Lefebvre 
[ 260 , 261 ], the classical breakup mechanism involving some surface 
instability  of  the  liquid  can  be  absent  if  the  impingement angle 
( θ
impinge ) is large. He cites the preﬁlming airblast atomizer of Beck 
et al. [262] as one example of such an atomizer in which ’prompt’ 
breakup  is  predominant.  Nevertheless,  jets  impinging  at  smaller 
θ
impinge  also approach the prompt breakup (sheetless breakup) at 
very high propellant jet velocity or GLR (or O/F ). Prompt breakup 
could  also  be  achieved  in  the  internally  impinging  atomizer  at 
moderate GLR s because it achieves a very high impingement angle 
and creates a dynamic internal ﬂow ﬁeld of air phase that signiﬁ- 
cantly distorts the exposed surface of jet of gel propellant. 

An illustrative sketch of the differences between the sheet and 
prompt mechanisms is drawn in Fig. 70 . Sketches at the bottom 
show externally impinging doublet jet atomizer used in gel pro- 
pellant (GP) atomization with shallow impingement angle of at- 
omization air (AA) jets and the internally impinging atomizer of 
Padwal and Mishra [49] . Corresponding photographs obtained us- 
ing Jet A1-Thixatrol ST-xylene gel propellant are shown for visual 
comparison.  Prompt  atomization  evidently  reduces  the  breakup 
length ( L 
b ) substantially and also produces droplets of a widely dis- 
tributed size range [52] . The images shown in Fig. 70 also reveal 
that prompt breakup mode can be approached by externally im- 
pinging atomizers of shallow impingement angle only if high mo- 
mentum is applied to the impinging jets, as will be found subse- 
quently. The open rim sheet breakup regime shown in Fig. 70 along 
with a typical case of breakup in the internally impinging atomizer 
[ 49 , 52 ] reinforces this point qualitatively. 

With  reference  to  the  particular  case  shown  for  the  inter- 
nally  impinging  atomizer,  no  experimental  evidence  of  prompt

breakup  at  comparable  conditions  ( u

l  ∼10 3 )  is  available  in  literature  for  the 
conventional (externally) impinging doublet or triplet jet atomiz- 
ers. For the prompt breakup, viscosity should not be allowed to 
delay the breakup [260] . This is corroborated for the internally im- 
pinging atomizer by the similar breakup structures of water, Jet A1, 
and Jet A1 gel propellant [110] . 

5.5. Breakup regimes 

Breakup of gel propellants using one of the atomizers described 
in Sections 5.1 - 5.3 via a relevant physical mechanism described in 
Section 5.4 leads to a variety of morphological states of the ﬂuids 
involved. Appearance of a particular state is intimately connected 
with the geometric conﬁguration of the atomizer, composition and 
properties of gel propellant, and the operating conditions. There- 
fore, the morphologies of breakup structures can be comprehen- 
sively documented using the photographic records of high-speed 
imaging studies and sequences of breakup events. Such records are 
then used to classify the observed states into breakup regimes for 
different operating conditions. 

5.5.1. Dimensionless groups 

Atomizer geometry, physical properties of gel propellants, and 
operating  conditions  are  combined  into  dimensionless  groups 
for  analysis  of  breakup  regimes.  Among  them,  the  generalized 
Reynolds  number  ( Re gen )  was  introduced  in  Section  4.6.2  and 
Table 11 . Additional dimensionless groups include the Weber num- 
l  and  We g ),  elasticity  number 
bers  of  liquid  and  gas  phases  ( We 
( El ), and Ohnesorge number ( Oh ). Weber number, deﬁned as W e = 
ρu 2 l /σ ,  is  the  ratio  of  inertia  and  surface  tension  forces  while 
Oh and El were previously deﬁned in Section 4.8.3 . Other groups 
involving  the  ratios  of  properties  and  geometric  parameters  can 
be  formed  by  dimensional  analysis  of  breakup  (see  for  example 

66 

Ref. [52] ) to complement the principle dimensionless groups. Many 
such groups exist. 

5.5.2. Breakup regimes in impinging jet atomization 

A  review  of  the  studies  devoted  to  the  breakup  characteris- 
tics of gel propellants and similar ﬂuids by impinging jet atom- 
ization shows that breakup regimes are named after physical fea- 
tures of  the  breakup structures  observed in visualizations. How- 
ever, largely the same features are named differently across stud- 
ies.  Thus,  Jejurkar  et  al.  [79]  use  "impact  wave  regime"  to  de- 
scribe  the  "ligament  structures  pattern"  of  von  Kampen  et  al. 
[107] ,  Baek  et  al.  [47] ,  and  Ramasubramanian  et  al.  [81] .  In  an- 
other  instance,  "fully  developed  pattern"  of  von  Kampen  et  al. 
[107]  and  Baek  et  al.  [47]  is  variously  described  in  literature  as 
"prompt" [ 260 , 261 ], "sheetless" [79] , or "catastrophic" [81] . Further, 
many transition regimes exhibiting the characteristics of two dis- 
tinct breakup regimes can also be observed [ 47 , 79 , 107 ] by ﬁnely 
controlling the operating conditions or chance observations. Then, 
some  regimes  are  of  bewildering  appearance;  see  for  example, 
Fig. 2 for u 

j = 7.5 m/s and 10 m/s in Ref. [226] . 

For  the  sake  of  simplicity  and  uniformity  of  description,  we 
therefore classify the breakup regimes in impinging jet atomiza- 
tion based on the presence of rim at the outer periphery of sheet 
as well as the presence of the sheet itself.

Any 
atomizer  capable  of  forming  a  two-dimensional  sheet  can  show 
these regimes, for example, the ﬂat fan nozzle tested by Hartranft 
and  Settles  [264]  and  by  Rothstein  and  coworkers  [ 225 , 256 ]. 
They are accessible at the low range of jet velocities for a given 
gel  propellant  in  which  the  jets  are  laminar.  These  regimes  are 
characterized by the presence of a thick rim along the periphery of

the sheet as seen in the images of Figs. 71-74 . In multiple possible 
variations, the rim could be stable [ 48 , 50 , 134 , 256 , 263 ] or unstable 
[ 40 , 47 , 50 , 79 , 81 , 90 , 105 , 134 , 171 , 256 ],  it  could  completely  close  the 
sheet  [ 40 , 47 , 50 , 79 , 81 , 90 , 105 , 134 , 171 , 255 ],  or  be  discontinuous  at 
the bottom edge of sheet [ 40 , 48 , 50 , 90 , 256 , 263 ]. Figs. 71-74 present 
the photographic records of the different breakup regimes found in 
literature for the rimmed sheets. Some examples of the variations 
involving  stable  rimmed  sheets  are  shown  in  Fig.  71 .  Invariably, 
all  stable  rimmed  sheets  open  at  the  bottom  have  holes  on 
their surface while the surface near to the impingement point is 
smooth. 

In addition to the abovementioned features of the rims them- 
selves,  rimmed  sheets  also  sometimes  exhibit  surface  waves 
at  the  interior  [ 48 , 50 , 79 , 105 , 250 , 263 ]  and  holes  in  the  periph- 
ery  and  interior  [ 47 , 79 , 81 , 225 , 256 , 263 ].  Holes  are  also  ubiqui- 
tous  on  the  rimmed  sheets  ruﬄed  by  surface  waves.  At  low 
jet momentum, relatively smooth surfaces are observed in sheets 
[ 47 , 48 , 50 , 79 , 134 , 225 , 263 ]. It should also be recognized that many 
other  possible  combinations  of  the  rim  characteristics  and  mor- 
phology  of  the  interior  surface  of  sheet  have  been  observed 
[ 48 , 225 , 250 ]  depending  upon  a  particular  combination  of  We 
l , 
Re gen , and Oh in addition to the composition and many other prop- 
erties of the gel propellant. 

Unstable rimmed sheets are observed as velocity of the jets in- 
creases, the jets themselves being still in the laminar range. Fig. 72 
is  the  compilation  of  many  features  of  unstable  rimmed  sheets 
found  in  gel  propellants  and  similar  ﬂuids.  Their  typical  feature 
is a wavy rim and appearance of ﬁnger-like structures on the rim 
near to the impingement point. Such structures eventually develop 
into the "ﬁshbone" pattern (for example, see Refs. [ 258 , 265 , 266 ]) 
of more or less symmetric distribution on either side of the long 
axis of the sheet. Such pattern is also observed for Newtonian liq- 
uids [ 258 , 265 , 266 ] and all the images shown in Fig. 72 exhibit at 
least the wavy rim, while some show the presence of ﬁshbone in- 
stability [266] . Bush and Hasha [266] have studied the nature of 
this  instability.  A  clear  distinction  should  be  made  between  the 
behavior of gels produced from particulate gellants like silica or 
containing metal particles and those produced from polymeric gel- 
lants like Carbopol and HPC, as evident in Fig. 72 . The particulate 

gels show dented interior surface and irregular jagged rims of the 
sheet in images (i) and (ii) due to the presence of particle clusters. 
Notably, the clusters also disrupt the general symmetry and order. 
Instead, smooth surfaces are observed in images (iv), (v), and (vii) 
for the polymeric gels. Remarkably smooth surfaces indicate that 
the  rim  instability  has  not  disturbed  the  sheet  surface  in  these 
cases. The composition of interior sheet surface is important for 
atomization in regimes accessible using jets of still higher velocity 
range as discussed subsequently. 

Fishbone instability is the only mechanism of atomization when 
the rim is closed at the bottom end, as seen from image (iv) of 
Fig.  72 .  However,  for  the  unstable  rim  open  at  the  bottom  end, 
holes nucleate and produce ligaments and droplets in turn as seen 
in image (vii) of Fig. 72 . Surface waves are set off in some cases 
(see bottom of image (vii)) when the ﬁshbone instability disrupts 
sheet.  Usually,  this  behavior  should  be  observed  in  the  thinnest 
portion of the sheet, i.e. bottom of the sheet with an open rim. 
Admittedly,  the  possible  variations  in  the  regimes  even  for  the 
rimmed sheets are many and examples are to be found in liter- 
ature in which, the combinations of above features are discovered. 
One such collection of visualizations is shown in Fig. 73 . 

All of them involve holes spread all over the interior surface of 
the sheet. Clusters of these holes (ﬂuid webs [225] ) ﬁrst appear on 
the periphery of the sheet (near the rim) because it is the thinnest 
part  and  then  grow  inward  and  downstream.  Similar  ﬂuid  webs 
form in the interior, predominantly in the lower portions. Sheets 
of the gels produced using particulate gellants (Thixatrol ST, fumed 
silica) and those containing nanoparticles (SUS304, Al 
3 ) are es- 
pecially affected by these ﬂuid webs (see images (ii)-(iv), (ix), and 
(x)), to the extent that peripheral holes appear very near to the im- 
pingement point (images (ii), (iii), and (ix)) unlike the cases with 
the polymeric gels (images (v)-(viii)).

b Rimless sheets 

Breakup regimes involving the rimless sheets of gels have been 
observed in Refs. [ 27 , 45-47 , 79 , 105-107 , 211 , 220 , 263 ], among others. 
They  are  accessible  at  the  medium  range  of  jet  velocities  for  a 
given gel propellant. Bow-shaped impact waves that form near the 
impingement point and travel downstream on the sheet surface are

the main feature of rimless sheets. For this reason, the observed 
regimes are also collectively called impact wave regimes [ 77 , 221 ]. 
Fluid mass riding on the waves takes the shape of transverse ori- 
ented ligaments when the liquid connecting two adjacent impact 
waves  recedes  completely.  They  gradually  break  up  into  smaller 
fragments and droplets downstream while traveling in the same 
general conﬁguration of a bow. Fig. 74 shows the visualizations of 
the impact wave regime for different gel propellants. 

Impact waves also form on an elongationally thickening Boger 
ﬂuid based on PEO as shown in Fig. 74 a [211] . The resulting liga- 
ments are continuous and roughly oriented in transverse direction. 
In other case of gel propellants, impact waves are usually accom- 
panied by holes on the peripheral and interior regions of the sheet 
as the velocity of impinging jets increases as seen from Figs. 74b- 
74f . Presence of these holes gives rise to the longitudinally oriented 
ligaments once the adjacent holes grow and coalesce, as shown in 
Figs. 74b-74d and 74f. The holes are concentrated in the regions 
close to the thinnest bottom edge of the sheet at lower velocities 
for rimless sheets and appear randomly at higher velocities almost 
anywhere. Holes provide an additional mechanism for the genera- 
tion of droplets because they contribute towards the longitudinally 
oriented ligaments. However, for the impact waves of short wave- 
length, such ligaments are usually mere fragments that might not 
break up further to produce droplets [79] , as shown in Figs. 74 c 
and 74 f. 

Several  studies  have  explored  the  processes  governing  nucle- 
ation, growth, and coalescence dynamics of the holes [267-273] for 
Newtonian ﬂuids. Recently, above observations of the holes were 
used to construct multiple competing scenarios for the nucleation 

and subsequent growth of holes on the surface of gel propellant 
sheets [79] . 

c Prompt (sheetless) breakup 

Prompt or sheetless breakup was observed in Refs. [ 81 , 106 , 109 ]. 
It is accessible at the highest jet velocities for a given gel propel- 
lant. As the name suggests, this regime involves almost direct at- 
omization  of  jets  at  the  impingement point  and  only  a  vestigial 
sheet can be visible sporadically. Impact waves, if any, are not eas- 
ily observed in this regime. Fig. 75 depicts the visualizations of this 
regime compiled for different gel propellants. 

Development of a full spray cone and transport of droplets of 
similar  size  in  large  clusters  are  other  features  observed  in  this 
regime.  Ramasubramanian  et  al.  [81]  investigated  this  regime  at 
high  chamber  pressures  as  the  ’catastrophic  regime’.  It  is  found 
that  the  impact  waves  are  completely  absent  and  the  breakup 
structures are irregular and large ( Fig. 75 d). 

Rodrigues  et  al.  [ 183 , 184 ]  have  catalogued  three  distinguish- 
ing regimes of impinging jet atomization of aq. CMC solutions, as 
shown in Fig. 76 . We have previously covered the rheological char- 
acteristics of these ﬂuids in Section 4.6.1 , according to which, the 
aq. CMC solutions [ 183 , 184 ] are inelastic ﬂuids. The three regimes 
shown in Fig. 76 are characterized in terms of the sheet morphol- 
ogy and otherwise, they belong to the impact wave regime. Regime 
shown in Fig. 76 a is characterized by a web of ligaments that forms 
once  the  holes  on  the  sheet  surface  bounded  by  successive  im- 
pact waves grow. Ligaments are oriented transversely and eventu- 
ally form drops after breakup. 

The  perforated  sheet  regime  is  shown  in  Fig.  76 b.  Similar 
regimes  were  described  above  (see  Figs.  73  and  74 ).  A  rimmed

sheet perturbed by impact waves and having wavy structures on 
the periphery along with ligaments is observed. Perforations form 
between the successive impact waves. Tangled web regime shown 
in  Fig.  76 c  is  like  the  web  of  ligaments  but  it  is  composed  of 
denser webs formed by threads. A few large drops were observed 
[ 183 , 184 ]. For the same concentration of CMC, it appears that this 
regime  at  high  shear  rates  is  probably  affected  by  extensional 
thickening. Previous examples of morphologically similar regimes 
could be found in Ref. [48] for a polysaccharide gellant and Refs. 
[ 162 , 211 ] for Boger ﬂuids (see Fig. 74 a). 

5.5.3. Breakup regimes in other atomizers 

Thompson and Rothstein [256] experimented with water-CTAB- 
NaSal  worm-like  micellar  solutions  of  varying  viscoelasticity  in 
pressure swirl (’hollow cone’) atomizers. Pressure swirl atomizer 
and its variations have also been used for the polysaccharide-water 
gel propellant simulant [ 160 , 249 ]. The breakup regimes found for 
the  polysaccharide  gels  [ 160 , 249 ]  are  easily  identiﬁed  using  the 
ones found for CTAB solutions, as shown in Fig. 77 . 

Breakup of viscous rotating jets follows the development of he- 
lical instability on the surface of jet (image (ii) in Figs. 77 a and 
77 b). The helical instability is a hallmark of the rotating viscous 
jets  [274] .  Initially,  the  jet  is  simply  twisted  as  in  image  (i)  of 
Figs. 77 a and 77 b. Increased ﬂow rates gradually lead to the de- 
velopment of a full cone and its breakup commences in the bot- 
tom regions after a critical cone angle. Thompson and Rothstein 
[256] used worm-like micellar solution and the breakup structures 
at  the  breakup  stage  of  cone  (image  (iii),  Fig.  77 a)  are  similarly 
composed of large droplets connected by thin and smooth bridges, 
just as found by Goldin et al. [191] for 0.25 % Separan solution. 
While the polysaccharide gel passed through the same stages as 
CTAB  solutions,  the  breakup  stage  of  full  cone  did  not  produce 
identiﬁable droplets and instead, interconnected clumps and mem- 
branes of the ﬂuid formed after the breakup. 

gel u 2 

gel ) or equivalently, by GLR at constant u 

Only  one  study  [27]  systematically  documented  the  breakup 
regimes for gel propellants in conventional two-ﬂuid (airblast) at- 
omizers. Investigations of Ciezki et al. [27] on the coaxial airblast 
atomizer produced the images for two gel propellants containing 
particulate gellants Thixatrol Plus and Aerosil, as shown in Fig. 78 . 
Swirling  air  of  relatively  very  high  momentum  accomplishes 
the breakup of a round jet of gel propellant of low momentum. 
The breakup regimes can be characterized by the momentum ﬂux 
a / ρ
ratio ( M = ρa u 2 
gel . 
Padwal et al. [275] have investigated the effects of M on the jet 
breakup  using  air-water  system  for  a  similar  atomizer  conﬁgu- 
ration  as  Ciezki  et  al.  [27] .  They  identiﬁed  two  breakup  mecha- 
nisms; one involving jet breakup due to the helical instability and 
another  as  jet  breakup  due  to  the  mixed  helical  instability  and 
shear breakup. The transition to the breakup regime governed by 
two breakup mechanisms is accompanied by the increase in the 
strength of recirculation zone of the annular air jet. Comparison of 
the visualizations made by Padwal et al. [275] for air-water system 
with the air-gel propellant presented in Fig. 78 shows remarkably 
similar breakup regimes, irrespective of the rheological differences. 
It should be noted that the round jet of liquid is shrouded by 
the shear layer of swirling air phase containing breakup fragments 
and droplet mist at high M [275] , a feature that is also observed in 
the case of gel propellants; images a(iii) and b(iii) in Fig. 78 illus- 
trate such a situation. Further, observations of these regimes sug- 
gest  that  the  propellant  jet  is  continuously  rotating  and  the  jet 
breakup length is approximately the same as the distance of the 
stagnation point from the exit plane of atomizer [275] . 

5.5.4. Parametric effects 

Investigations  relying  on  the  visualizations  of  breakup  events 
have uncovered many parametric effects for gel propellants, some 
are similar to the Newtonian ﬂuids and others being distinctly dif-

ferent. Parameters addressed in the visualizations include the jet 
velocity  ( u

impingement angle (2 θ ) [ 45 , 276 ], momentum ﬂux ratio between 
the  gas  and  liquid  streams  ( M )  [27] ,  nozzle  aspect  ratio  ( l o / d o ) 
[ 39 , 223 , 263 ],  atomizer  conﬁguration  [ 134 , 160 , 249-251 , 256 ],  We 
[ 250 , 256 ], Re gen [ 39 , 81 , 90 , 106 , 107 , 223 , 263 ], chamber pressure ( P C ) 
[81] ,  and  supply  pressure  ( P S )  [ 50 , 134 , 160 , 249 ]  or  pressure  drop 
( (cid:2)P ) [ 77 , 79 ]. Some of these effects are obviously not exclusive be- 
j  effect can be expressed as due to P S , (cid:2)P, M, Re gen , 
cause the u 
or We . Some uncorrelated effects also enter into the consideration 
j [40] , d o , 2 θ , L PI /d o , u 
during experiments, for example l o / d o and u 
j 
[40] , and u 

j - Y G [126] . 

Correlated effects of different parameters have been observed, 
especially  among  the  studies  which  arrange  the  results  of  visu- 
alizations in a  grid  pattern  as  in Jejurkar  et  al.  [ 77 , 79 ], and Lee 
and  Koo  [46] .  Matching  of  parameters  is  rarely  possible  for  gel 
propellants because of the uncertainties involved in the effect of 
viscosity  on  Oh,  We ,  and  Re gen  (see  for  example  Refs.  [ 277 , 278 ] 
as quoted in Ref. [279] ) and only approximate correlative effects 
of the matched parameters can be observed, as in Jejurkar et al. 
[79] and possibly in Lee and Koo [46] . The situation is further com- 
plicated because the dimensionless groups governing the breakup 
processes of gel propellants are too many (see Sections 4.6.2 and 
5.5.1 )  and  since  comprehensive  rheological  characterizations  are 
often not conducted to assign proper ranges of magnitudes to the 
available groups. 

We have listed the parametric effects above in accordance with 
their use by respective authors. Some overlap is inevitable because 

often for example, a variation in We is simply due to the variation 
j . Only the effects of geometric parameters can be clearly iso- 
in u 
lated in practice. In general, increase in u 
j (hence, related param- 
eters) would enable access to more violent breakup regimes and 
associated  morphological  features  of  the  breakup  structures  dis- 
cussed above would become apparent. 

5.5.5. Regime maps 

Dimensionless groups discussed in Section 5.5.1 reveal that a 
comprehensive  regime  map  for  the  breakup  of  gel  propellants 
would be a hyperspace bounded by many dimensionless groups, 
viz. Re gen , We 
l , We a , El, Oh , and others yet to be identiﬁed, in addi- 
tion to the ratios of thermophysical properties and geometric fac- 
tors. In practice, the literature on gel propellant breakup commonly 
considers a slice of this hyperspace bounded by We and Re gen  of 
the gel propellant to plot the different regimes of impinging jet at- 
omization [ 79 , 81 , 107 , 219 , 263 ]. Same representation works for the 
Newtonian ﬂuids also  due  to  the  use of  Re gen  (see Metzner  and 
Reed [187] for the basis of using Re gen ). Ramasubramanian et al. 
[81] suggested to modify We and Re gen  of the jet by the density 
ratio ( ρg / ρ
l ) to accommodate the cases where breakup occurs un- 
der high ambient pressures. Fig. 79 compiles the available data on 
sheet breakup of water [ 81 , 107 , 263 ] in Fig. 79 a and viscous New- 
tonian ﬂuids [ 107 , 219 ] in Fig. 79 b. 

As  shown  in  Fig.  79 a,  the  breakup  regimes  of  water  sheets 
in  the  ambient  atmosphere  are  aligned  in  one  line,  with  severe 
breakup  regimes  accessible  at  higher  We  and  Re .  The  effects  of 
ambient pressures (expressed in the form of air-liquid density ra- 
tio,  ρg / ρ
l )  on  the  breakup  of  liquid  sheets  are  known  for  long

[ 81 , 221 , 280 , 281 ], and mainly felt as an additional inertia force on 
the sheet at pressures substantially higher than the normal atmo- 
spheric pressure [ 280 , 281 ]. The same alignment of regimes is also 
to be found at higher ambient pressures. It should be noted that 
all the data points shown in Fig. 79 a would fall on one line, irre- 
spective of the ambient pressures if the multiplier ( ρg / ρ
l ) were not 
used for We and Re . 

Effects of purely viscous action on the breakup regimes are il- 
lustrated  by  Fig.  79 b  using  three  Newtonians  water,  EG,  and  98 
% glycerin of gradually increasing viscosity. The resulting breakup 
regimes are also mentioned. In these cases, the range of viscos- 
ity is 0.001-0.9 Pa.s ( Oh = 0.0044-3.83) and σ = 48-74 mN/m. The 
delayed aerodynamic instability induced breakup in glycerin is a 
notable outcome of the viscous effects. Bailardi et al. [219] have 
compiled extensive data on other Newtonians based on which the 
general trends for the appearance of a breakup regime in a given 
range of We and Re can be outlined. 

Gel  propellants and  their  base  liquid  propellants [ 81 , 107 , 263 ] 
are considered next in Fig. 80 . The trends in the breakup regimes 
when base ﬂuids are compared with gels are compiled in Fig. 80 a 
for a gel propellant and in Figs. 80 b and 80 c for water gel simu- 
lants. We consider the pairs of Jet A1/Jet A1-Thixatrol ST-MIAK-Al 
gel propellant [107] , ethanol-water/ethanol-water-Carbopol-Cabosil 
gel [81] , water/water-Carbopol gel [263] , and water/water-Cabosil 
gel  [263] for  illustration.  Data  for  NM/NM-Byk  gel  and  NM/NM- 

71 

Aerosil gel are also available in literature [107] . The simultaneous 
effects  of  multiple  rheological  properties  of  gels  could  inﬂuence 
such trends. These effects have not been studied quantitatively yet 
although the qualitative description of such effects is possible, as 
discussed in Section 5.7 . 

l ) and Re × ( ρg / ρ

Data in Fig. 80 c are mapped using We × ( ρg / ρ

l ) 
in  place  of  We  and  Re  to  indicate  the  deviations  resulting  from 
inertia force at higher ambient pressures and covers the pressure 
amb = 0.1-3.45 MPa. We remind here that the deﬁnitions of 
range P 
Re gen  depend  on  the  underlying  ﬂow  model  used  for  simulating 
the complex rheological ﬂow behavior of gel using two or more 
parameters  ( Section  4.6 ).  Fig.  80 a  shows  the  limitation  of  Re gen 
based on power law (see Eq. (10), Table 11 , Section 4.6.2 ) when 
the shear viscosity of gel exceeds the Newtonian viscosity ( η∞ ). 
The  Re gen,PL  is  invalid  for η<η∞  and  the  points  on  the  map  are 
shifted ad hoc on the map for Jet A1 based on the argument that 
the gel propellant practically behaves like its Newtonian base ﬂuid 
for η<η∞ .  Otherwise,  the  general  trends  of  Fig.  80  suggest  that 
the regime map for a gel propellant or its simulant is positioned 
on the left of its base ﬂuid such that a higher We is essential to 
obtain the same regime as the base ﬂuid. However, explanation of 
these trends based on the relative importance of surface tension 
forces, viscous forces, and inertia forces are at the least of uncer- 
tain validity since the comprehensive rheological characterization

under a particular regime is lacking and the surface age is often 
unknown. 

Not all the maps of breakup regimes involving impinging jets 
and ﬂat fan nozzles can be drawn using We and Oh; El has been 
used instead of Oh for highly elastic ﬂuids [ 225 , 256 ]. Thompson 
and Rothstein [256] also mapped the sheet breakup using pressure 
swirl (hollow cone) nozzle. Figs. 81 a and 81 b compile the data of 
Rothstein and coworkers [ 225 , 256 ] for different nozzles. Morpho- 
logical features of these regimes were discussed in Section 5.5.3 . 

Coil [282] has followed a similar method as above for the im- 
pinging  jets  and  it  was  used  by  McCabe  and  Coil  [226]  to  pro- 
duce  a  regime  map  in  the  G’-Re  coordinate  space  as  shown  in 
Fig. 81 c. The Reynolds number is estimated from the usual rela- 
tionship by inserting the viscosity prevailing at the levels of injec- 
tor shear rates. For the viscoelastic gels of SEBS (styrene-ethylene 
butylene-styrene  triblock  polymer)  dissolved  in  mineral  oil,  the 
regimes leading to sheet breakup are reached only at progressively 
higher jet velocities as found in Fig. 81 c. Further, the full develop- 
ment of gel sprays is precluded due to the elasticity. 

We further stress the importance of searching for more rele- 
vant dimensionless groups in the breakup studies of near future 
so that the multiple observations of some gels (in particular, those 
produced from particulate gellants) being easier to atomize than 
their base ﬂuids [126] could be resolved. Some help already ex- 
ists  in  the  treatment  of  Oh  by  Zhao  et  al.  [283]  in  which,  the 
Oh is shown to be composed of two dimensionless groups ema- 
nating from the ﬂow model of the CWS (Bingham model, Eq. (9), 
Table 10 , Section 4.6.1 ). This observation presents yet another mo- 
tivation for comprehensive rheological characterization of gels so 
that their ﬂow models could be accurately determined and the si- 
multaneous effects of thixotropy, yield stress, viscoelasticity, and 
shear are thereby demarcated.

Apart from the impinging jets, breakup regimes for the coax- 
l - We a  co- 
ial airblast atomizers can also be represented in the Re 
ordinate  space  parameterized  by  the  momentum  ﬂux  ratio  M 
( ρg u 2 
g / ρ
l ) between the air and gel propellant jets, similar to the 
conventional  representation,  for  example  in  Ref.  [275] .  However, 
very little has been done in this area using gel propellants, apart 
from the work of Ciezki et al. [27] discussed in relation to Fig. 78 . 
Effort s are also required for the classiﬁcation of breakup regimes 
of pressure swirl atomization of gel propellants and a systematic 
comparison of the Newtonian and gel propellant cases should also 
be undertaken. 

We would discuss the regimes for drop breakup in Section 5.6 . 
Many dimensionless groups also govern these secondary breakup 
processes of drops; see for example Hsiang and Faeth [284] and 
the review by Guildenbecher et al. [279] . A case of interest is that 
of coal-water slurry (CWS) fuels for which, Zhao et al. [283] pro- 
duced  a  regime  map  while  accounting  for  the  effects  of  shear 
thinning and yield stress of many CWS fuels. In all these works, 
the  mapping  of  secondary  droplet  breakup  regimes  is  done  on 
the  We-Oh  coordinate  space.  Rheological  effects  to  be  discussed 
in Section 5.7 indicate that additional dimensionless groups might 
be required for mapping the secondary breakup regimes of CWS 
drops. Regime maps for the CWS drops are shown in Fig. 82 .

breakup regime is also found in the Newtonians (see Fig. 83 d as 
well as Fig. 2 in Opfer et al. [287] ). 

Presence of signiﬁcant elasticity in the water-XG gel simulant 
prevents its ligaments from breaking up into child droplets in both 
the  bag  and  more  violent  multimode  breakup  regimes  ( Fig.  83 d 
and 83 e, respectively). Further, growth and stretching of the ﬁlm 
forming the bag was found to be more in XG solutions, resulting 
in a longer delay in breakup. Ligaments attached to the rim in- 
stead elongate as the ﬂow time passes. Theoretical development of 
Sojka and coworkers [ 197 , 285 , 286 ] on such solutions is concerned 
with the correlations of breakup times with We and Oh referred to 
the drop and the applicability of the Taylor analogy breakup (TAB) 
model. 

Hypergolic  bipropellants  are  commonly  employed  in  liquid 
rocket engines in the form of impinging jets. Atomization is fol- 
lowed by hypergolic ignition and ﬂame propagation throughout the 
mixture  of  fuel  and  oxidizer  droplets.  Droplets  of  fuel  and  oxi- 
dizer need to come in contact to facilitate local ignition and the 
collision processes between droplets become important precursors 
to  successful  ﬂame  stabilization.  Oblique  collisions  of  viscoelas- 
tic droplets were simulated by Mooney et al. [288] by modeling 
the  viscoelasticity  using  Phan-Thien-Tanner  model  for  stress  and 
time-accurate tracking of the droplet surfaces during the collision 
process.  Extensional  thickening  was  found  to  widen  the  regime 
in  which,  the  two  droplets  coalesce.  Mooney  et  al.  [289]  simu- 
lated breakup of shear-thinning droplets using the Carreau-Yasuda 
model  of  water-0.05  %  XG  as  an  example  in  a  volume  of  ﬂuid 
method. They found that while shear thinning did not affect the 
regime boundaries, it lengthened the growth of bag and ligament 
and caused more deformation of droplet. 

Law and coworkers [290] investigated the head-on collision of 
droplets of water-Carbomer gel propellant simulant and explored 
the various scenarios that develop after the collision. It is impor- 
tant to note here that gel propellants are generally less volatile due 
to the barriers created by gellant network and mixing of the fuel 
and oxidizer is critical. Further, for increasing the contact time, col- 
liding droplets must coalesce. Therefore, attention was focused on 
the droplets of unequal size to promote coalescence because re- 
duced deformation and viscous loss also reduce the projected area 
and loss of inertia [290] . Experiments were also conducted with 
equal-size  droplets  and  the  recorded  sequence  of  collision  pro- 
cesses is shown in Fig. 84 for water-0.1 % Carbomer gel. 

As deﬁned in Fig. 84 , the droplet Weber number ( We

This behavior is due to the increased shear viscosity of the collid- 
ing droplets that is responsible for viscous dissipation. Thus, avoid- 
ing the collision regimes that promote bouncing or separation and 
instead promoting the coalescence by use of unequal-size droplets 
and high gellant concentration are important factors for the hyper- 
golic ignition and combustion of gel propellants. 

The  collision  dynamics  of  hypergolic  propellants  and  their 
gelled counterparts have been also investigated using the volume- 
of-ﬂuid  based  interface  tracking  of  colliding  droplets  [89] .  The

cosity. These dimensionless groups were introduced to demarcate 
the boundary between the hole and tensile breakup sub-regimes 
of the multimode regime (found also in Newtonians), shown in the 
bottom panel of Fig. 82 . It is found that the boundary between the 
two sub-regimes is not distinct when We and Oh are used (see the 
top panel of Fig. 82 ). Their preliminary analysis indicates that the 
boundary is governed by yield stress ( τ
yield ), momentum ﬂux of air 
stream ( ρg u 2 

g ), and the phasic density ratio ( ρg / ρ

l ). 

5.6. Secondary breakup of non-newtonian drops 

Guildenbecher  et  al.  [279]  reviewed  the  secondary  breakup 
regimes  and  mechanisms  of  non-Newtonian  drops  and  subse- 
quently, Sojka and coworkers [ 197 , 285 , 286 ] documented the sec- 
ondary breakup regimes of gel propellant simulants composed of 
0.05-1 % XG in water. Zhao et al. [283] handled eight different coal- 
water slurry (CWS) compositions and discovered new breakup sub- 
regimes. All these studies used high-speed visualizations of the de- 
forming  drops  of  known  initial  sizes  after  being  injected  in  the 
cross ﬂow of high-speed air. 

Fig. 83 is a compilation of the breakup regimes for CWS drops 
and  water-XG  gel  propellant  simulants.  It  shows  the  morpholo- 
gies of large drops when they undergo bag, multimode, and shear 
breakup in response to the inertial force of high-speed air in cross 
ﬂow. 

Many common features of these breakup events could be ob- 
served  using  the  discussion  and  diagrams  in  Ref.  [279] .  There- 
fore, we conﬁne our attention to a qualitative description of the 
few distinguishing features of the non-Newtonian ﬂuids. CWS has 
been classiﬁed by Zhao et al. [283] as a Bingham plastic and they 
found  the  existence  of  two  distinct  sub-regimes,  hole  (conven- 
tional  bag  breakup  regime)  and  tensile  (conventional  vibrational 
breakup), which could be distinguished using the yield stress ef- 
fects. We discuss these regimes in relation to the regime maps in 
Section 5.5.5 and the rheological effects in Section 5.7 . The hole

of the coalesced drop. The mixing of liquids is also reduced in the 
case of gel droplets in comparison to the base liquid propellants. 

5.7. Rheological effects in breakup 

Chief distinction between the gel propellants and liquid propel- 
lants is the complex rheological behavior of the gels discussed at 
length in Section 4 . Similar to the conditions encountered in the 
case of non-rheological parametric effects on the breakup of gel 
propellants ( Section 5.5.4 ), the rheological properties of gels, viz. 
shear thinning, viscoelasticity, yield stress, and thixotropy are con- 
nected with each other in a complicated manner (See for exam- 
ple Ref. [149] ). Therefore, identiﬁcation and characterization of an 
observed  effect  as  due  to  a  particular  rheological  property  from 
among the above are usually only qualitatively correct. In this re-

ids was tracked in terms of the mass fraction of RFNA ( Y RFNA ) and 
Fig. 85 shows the snapshots of the collision process using states of 
the two droplets with (cid:4)t = 2 ms. It is observed that the droplets 
deform considerably upon collision and the ﬂuids mix with each 
other  as  coalescence  progresses.  Viscosity  of  the  gel  prevented 
shear-induced circulation patterns. Less sheared region of the drop 
volume also prevented deformation and thereby dictated the shape

spect, caution should also be exercised in associating the variations 
in Re gen and Oh with "viscosity effects" unless the viscosity itself is 
varied appropriately. 

Given this situation, the rheological effects on the breakup of 
gel propellants are manifested in different instances. We identify 
the  following  conditions:  when  the  breakup  of  a  base  ﬂuid  and 
its gel are compared [ 47 , 81 , 105 , 197 , 225 , 263 ], when metal/particle 
concentration in gel propellant is varied [ 47 , 79 , 106 ], when the gel- 
lant types are compared [ 27 , 263 ], when the gellant concentration 
itself is varied [53] , when the solvent type is changed [109] , and 
when the additives affecting a speciﬁc rheological property are var- 
ied [ 79 , 225 , 256 ]. Rheological effects are also manifested in the un- 
correlated [ 46 , 79 ] or approximately matched conditions [79] . Stud- 
ies arranging their results in a grid pattern afford the realization of 
simultaneous rheological effects due to many variables (for exam- 
ple Ref. [211] ). 

Breakup regimes described in Sections 5.5.2 , 5.5.3 , and 5.6 are 
observed for many types of gel propellants but not all of them are 
found in the Newtonian ﬂuids, suggesting the inﬂuence of rheo- 
logical properties of gel propellants. Different effects are observed 
in the breakup patterns depending upon the dominant rheological 
property  of  a  shear-thinning gel.  Shear  thinning  complicates  the 
viscous effect because its magnitude varies spatially and tempo- 
rally. Viscoelasticity is the second rheological property expressed in 
the breakup regimes in addition to the purely viscous effects. Yield 
stress has also been invoked to explain the secondary breakup of 
shear thinning coal-water-slurry drops [283] . 

Gel propellant jets are sometimes too viscous to be atomized by 
the plain oriﬁce atomizers, except at very high jet velocities. The 
pre-impingement Ohnesorge number ( Oh ), only an approximate in- 
dicator of the relative balance among inertia, surface, and viscous 
forces in case of gel propellants, is signiﬁcantly greater than 1 in 
such cases (for example Oh = 2.93 [21] ). Under such a condition, 
the viscous and surface forces dominate the destabilizing inertia 
force and damp out instability on the surface of ﬂuid jet. Conse- 
quently, other methods of atomization have been employed to re- 
duce the viscosity of gel propellant in which the impingement of 
high-momentum jets (liquid-liquid or gas-liquid) and creation of 
intensely turbulent regions are incorporated (see Section 5.3 ). 

Visualizations of breakup events using high-speed imaging have 
revealed  the  complexity  and  range  of  rheological  effects  mani- 
fested in the breakup of gel propellants and similar ﬂuids. Thomp- 
son  and  Rothstein  [256]  observed  that  the  sheets  of  viscoelas- 
tic  CTAB-NaSal-water  solutions  showed  stable  rims  unlike  water 
sheets emanating from a ﬂat fan nozzle. On the other hand, Je- 
jurkar  et  al.  [79]  showed  that  unstable  rims  could  also  be  ob- 
tained during the impinging jet atomization of weakly viscoelas- 
tic ISROsene-Thixatrol ST-xylene gel propellant. Since, the exten- 
sional  viscosity  increases  with  decreasing  shear  (see  Fig.  23 a, 
Section 4.2.3 for an example), it results in the formation of a thick 
rim. 

Miller et al. [225] and latter Thompson and Rothstein [256] re- 
ported the ’ﬂuid webs’ in thick-rimmed viscoelastic sheets. A ran- 
dom failure of the sheet in its interior nucleates a hole and ﬂuid 
is retracted by surface and elastic stresses, forming an internal rim 
[225] . Nucleation and growth of many such holes lead to the ﬂuid 
webs. Thompson and Rothstein [256] reported that rim instability 
was prevented by the viscoelasticity of ﬂuid. However, it resulted 
in the instability in the interior of the sheet by above mechanism. 
Further, more dominant viscoelastic component led to very stable 
sheets in the interior as well. 

Dennis  et  al.  [ 40 , 150 ]  observed  the  effect  of  frequency- 
dependent dynamic rheology of the cellulose-based MMH gels on 
their  atomization.  Mallory  and  Sojka  [171]  (See  also  Ref.  [40] ) 
investigated  the  weakly  viscoelastic  water-HPC  gels  as  well  as 
inelastic  water-agar  gels  and  demonstrated  that  the  frequency- 

independent  water-agar  gels  are  easier  to  atomize  than  the 
frequency-dependent water-HPC gels. 

Yang  et  al.  [134]  found  unstable  rims  in  the  frequency- 
dependent viscoelastic polysaccharide-water gel simulant although 
the  subsequent  breakup  of  gels  was  hampered.  They  also  iden- 
tiﬁed  the  difference  in  the  spray  patterns  of  gel  simulant  and 
water  in  pressure  swirl  atomizers.  Most  of  the  ligaments  of  a 
polysaccharide-water gel simulant did not break up into individ- 
ual droplets at once and remained as ﬂoccules due to the web-like 
molecular structure of the gel [134] . Such structures intermix with 
droplets  because  the  breakup  times  of  the  ligaments  are  widely 
distributed. Thus, these studies show that atomization of gel pro- 
pellants and their simulants not only depends upon shear thinning 
but also on the elastic response of the gel at different time scales 
of the processes. 

Since, inclusion of solid metal particles in the gel propellants 
is desirable, rheological effects are further complicated by the in- 
terference  from  these  particles  on  the  sheet  stability.  For  exam- 
ple, water exhibited the impact wave and fully developed patterns 
similar to Figs. 74 and 75 but not the ray-shaped pattern [107] . Je- 
jurkar et al. [79] have reported on the role of particle clusters in 
the nucleation of holes on the sheet surface. It can be concluded 
that the hole mediated breakup of sheet is prominently found in 
viscoelastic ﬂuids including gel propellants [ 79 , 134 , 225 , 256 ]. 

We now further discuss the rheological effects using the data 
of  visualization  studies.  However,  quantitative  information  on 
this  issue  is  still  sparse,  a  notable  exception  being  the  regime 
classiﬁcation  attempted  by  Zhao  et  al.  [283]  and  discussed  in 
Sections 5.5.5 and 5.6 (see also Figs. 79-82 ). For this purpose, we 
have selected speciﬁc examples in which these effects are the least 
affected by the unintentional variations in other properties. Fig. 86 
indicates them for the sheets of water-0.35 % Carbopol gel neutral- 
ized by TEA and loaded with 15 % 100 nm SUS304 (steel) nanopar- 
ticles [47] . Baek and Kim [51] have extensively characterized this 
gel system in a companion study. 

Conditions reported in Fig. 86 constitute a typical case with gel 
propellants, and it is an important example of the interconnected 
rheological and atomization properties. The gels used in Fig. 86 are 
classiﬁed as power law gels [47] . We also observe that multiple 
rheological properties are at work here. In fact, we see direct evi- 
dence of shear thinning and viscoelasticity. We select the breakup 
length ( L 
b , as indicated on the images) to compare the three cases. 
Gross rheological effects can be expressed as the delay to breakup 
in the form of longer L 
b when water is compared with its gels. The 
breakup regime for water is also more violent than the other cases. 
Notice that between water-Carbopol-TEA and water-Carbopol-TEA- 
SUS304 gels, the latter is more viscous (10 ×) at all shear rates 
( ˙ γ ). 

However, L 

b for the highly loaded water-Carbopol-TEA-SUS gel 
is actually smaller than the unloaded gel, even though the loaded 
gel  yields  at  a  higher  stress  than  the  unloaded  gel.  This  is  an- 
other  example  of  extreme  shear  thinning  (See  Section  4.2.4  and 
Ref. [149] ) and can be justiﬁed based on the microstructural analy- 
sis of Baek and Kim [51] which suggests that SUS304 nanoparticles 
compete with the polymer-polymer network formation and tend to 
instead form polymer-nanoparticle network. The end-result of this 
competition is a less elastic Carbopol-SUS gel and its extreme shear 
thinning. As mentioned by Baek and Kim [51] , the SUS gel tends to 
lose its structure almost instantaneously once the imposed stress 
overcomes τ

yield . 

Similar  interconnected  rheological  effects  are  responsible  for 
the  behavior  of  water  and  water-Carbopol  round  jets  [ 39 , 223 ] 
in  the  near-ﬁeld.  On  the  other  hand,  Negri  et  al.  [211]  demon- 
strate the purely elastic effects (on the background of a constant 
purely  viscous  effect)  of  Boger  ﬂuids  subjected  to  impingement.

sional viscosity ηext ) is useful here to explain the remarkable sta- 
bility  of  threads  formed  with  ﬂuids  of  higher  Deborah  number 
( De = λu 
j /d o ). Such effects are probably also relevant for the water- 
polysaccharide gels used by Yang and coworkers [ 134 , 250 ]. Goldin 
et al. [191] previously gave a similar explanation for the laminar 
capillary jets of viscoelastic ﬂuids. Additional quantitative effects 
of viscoelasticity on the breakup are described by McCabe and Coil 
[226] and will be discussed in the following. 

Another  facet  of  the  rheological  effects  is  manifested  in  the 
form of experimental observations of secondary breakup of drops 
indicating  that  some  breakup  regimes  (hole  and  tensile  breakup 
in the multimode regime [283] ) cannot be distinguished by We- 
Oh boundaries clearly and require additional dimensionless groups 
dependent on yield stress ( X and He ) for that purpose. Snyder and 
Sojka [197] also found We and Oh to be insuﬃcient for mapping 
the secondary breakup of elastic non-Newtonian drops. 

McCabe and Coil [226] provide further connection between the 
rheological  and  breakup  properties  using  proper  orthogonal  de- 
composition  (POD)  and  fast  Fourier  transform  (FFT)  (spatial  and 
temporal)  on  the  images  of  high-speed  visualization.  They  used 
mineral oil and its gels comprising of 2 % linear (G1650M) and 3 % 
branched (FG1901X) tri-block polymer (styrene-ethylene butylene- 
styrene, SEBS) gellants. The resulting gel propellants are compati- 
ble with insensitive munitions (with reference to leakage through a 
hole punctured in the storage container). Impinging jet atomization 
( d o = 0.406 mm, 2 θ = 120 o , u 
j,max = 35 m/s,  ˙ γmax = 6.9 × 10 5 s −1 ) of 
the gels and base mineral oils led to different regimes, the selected 
among which are shown in Fig. 87 . 

In the energy-spectra shown, the peak frequency corresponds 
to the largest characteristic size of the breakup structures. For the 
mineral oil, the characteristic size is on the order of the largest 
drop ∝ 2 f  -1  ( ∼198  μm).  Lack

of  sphericity of  the  breakup structures  did not  permit  the char- 
acterization of droplet size [226] . Further, the breakup fragments 
at the same shear rate (e.g.  ˙ γ = 2.95 × 10 5 s −1 ) are similarly sized 
for the gel ( - ) and base propellant ( –). Shape of the spectra differs 
between the fully developed and less developed sprays, with the 
former showing narrower peaks of high amplitude, as shown for

shear rate ( ˙ γ

spray is fully developed (i.e. majority of the breakup structures are 
droplets) and plotted the transition shear rate as a function of the

It shows that the gels are more diﬃcult to break up at higher 
gellant concentration and the size of breakup structures also in-

at lower ˙ γ

ing to McCabe and Coil [226] , invoking the effects of viscosity and

tion to average size estimates ( D 32 , D 10 , etc.), and spray cone an- 
gle (2 α’ ). In the case of impinging jets, other speciﬁc properties 
viz. frequency ( f ), wavelength ( λ), and wave propagation speed ( u p ) 
must also be measured when the breakup regime involves impact 
waves. In the following, the current literature on these spray prop- 
erties is reviewed using a number of datasets. We also include here 
discussion on the miscellaneous properties of sprays, in particular 
the hole dynamics. 

5.8.1. Breakup length 

Breakup lengths of gel propellant and their simulants were re- 
ported by von Kampen et al. [36] , Fakhri et al. [ 39 , 223 ], Mallory 
and Sojka [120] , Yang et al. [ 48 , 134 , 251 ], Baek et al. [47] , Rama- 
subramanian et al. [81] , and Jejurkar et al. [77] for the impinging 
jets. Goldin et al. [ 126 , 191 ] reported the data for plain oriﬁce at- 
omizers. Yang et al. [ 160 , 249 ], Kim et al. [143] , and recently Guan 
et al. [245] obtained the breakup lengths for pressure swirl atom- 
izers. Moreover, we have also extracted breakup length data us- 
ing the published results of visualizations of coaxial airblast atom- 
izer (see Fig. 78 ) by Ciezki et al. [27] . The reported data are com- 
piled in Figs. 89 and 90 for the doublet impinging jets [ 36 , 39 , 46- 
48 , 77 , 81 , 120 , 223 , 228 , 251 ] and in Fig. 91 for the plain oriﬁce atom- 
izers [126] . The deﬁnitions of generalized Reynolds numbers could

in Fig. 92 . In each case, the L 
ameter ( d o ) and trends are expressed in terms of relevant variables 
( Re gen , We , (cid:4)P, M ), as the case may be. 

Rodrigues et al. [184] measured the L 

b  for sheets of aq. CMC 
solutions formed with impinging jets. Due to the tendency of the 
ﬂuids to produce tangled web (see Figs. 76 a and 76 c), the data are 
subject to considerable uncertainty when images are used to es-

silica and Thixatrol ST [ 36 , 77 , 81 ] and containing particles [ 36 , 77 ] 
break  up  within  a  shorter  distance  in  comparison  to  other  gels 
composed of the polymeric gellants like Carbopol, agar, XG, etc. 

In fact, the breakup lengths of the former are comparable to 
that of impinging jets of water [ 39 , 81 , 223 ]. The breakup length (ra- 
dius) data obtained by Chojnacki and Feikema [228] used rather 
steep impingement angles (2 θ = 180 o ) which lead to the head-on 
impingement of the jets. Their results did not show any correlation 
with the results produced by Huang [292] for head-on impinge- 
ment. Particulate additives like micro-Al, nano-Al 
3 used in some 
experiments [ 36 , 77 ] seem to further contribute to the reduction in 
the breakup lengths of the Jet A1-Thixatrol ST gel propellants, as 
seen from Figs. 89 and 90 . It should also be noted that the use of 
elliptic jets [251] for water-XG gels, suggested some times to trig- 
ger the instability on jet surface, does not result in the reduction 
of breakup lengths as observed from Fig. 90 . 

2 O 

Goldin and coworkers [126] studied the breakup of round jets 
of  gels  composed  of  polymeric  and  particulate  organic  gellants. 
The breakup length data were reduced as a function of We and 
Re gen,PL as in Fig. 91 , using the proposal of Grant and Middleman 
[293]  originally  tested  on  Newtonian  ﬂuids.  In  doing  so,  Goldin 
et al. [126] used the initial jet diameters and shear dependent vis- 
cosity of the visco-inelastic gels to deﬁne We and Re . This is prob- 
ably the only attempt in which the breakup properties of differ- 
ent gels could be correlated simultaneously in terms of Weber and 
generalized Reynolds numbers. 

Goldin et  al.  [126] noted that  the data for gels would fall in 
the same region as that of Newtonians when plotted in the above 
manner and also cautioned against using the zero shear viscosity 
in the estimation of Re . According to them, this agreement indi- 
cates that the time required for structural reformation of these gels 
is signiﬁcantly longer than the breakup time of jets. 

Breakup length data are shown in Fig. 92 a for pressure swirl 
atomizers  in  terms  of  the  pressure  drop  ( (cid:2)P )  across  the  ori- 
ﬁce. Yang and coworkers obtained the breakup lengths for water- 
2%  polysaccharide  solutions  on  conventional  [160]  and  modiﬁed 
[249]  pressure-swirl  atomizers.  A  leaf  spring  was  introduced  in 
the  swirl  chamber  (dia.  18  mm)  [249] .  Resulting  trends  indicate 
that only minor differences resulted from this modiﬁcation. Per- 
haps more pertinent here is the observation that the polysaccha- 
ride gel failed to produce reasonably sized droplets (or even iso- 
lated  ligaments).  On  the  other  hand,  Kim  et  al.  [143]  recently 
used conventional pressure-swirl atomizer (nozzle dia. 2 mm, swirl 
chamber  dia.  7  mm)  to  demonstrate  that  Jet  A1-Thixatrol  ST- 
micro-Al  gel  propellants  (of  similar  composition  as  that  of  Refs. 
[ 36 , 44 , 49 , 52 , 53 , 77 , 110 , 111 ]) could break up relatively more easily 
and at lower (cid:2)P . Rheological properties of these extremely shear 
thinning gels are favorable for early breakup, perhaps due to their 
particulate  nature.  Future  rheological  studies  and  accurate  mea- 
surements of relaxation and retardation time spectra of these gels 
are essential to elucidate their behavior further. 

In Fig. 92 b, we have used the images of jet breakup taken at 
given  momentum  ﬂux  ratio  ( M )  between  atomizing  air  and  gel 
propellants for a commercial airblast atomizer [27] to obtain in- 
stantaneous breakup length data. Both streams were co-swirled at 
30 o through two coaxial tubes at a ﬁxed velocity of propellant jet 
to obtain the images. The images shown in the inset suggest that 
the ﬂuid dynamic processes governing the breakup of gel propel- 
lant jet are controlled by the swirling motion of atomizing air, as 
expected for M >> 1 [275] . However, the morphological features 
of fragments of two gel propellants in the immediate aftermath of 
breakup are different. The highly particulate silica gel breaks up 
into large fragments and droplets while ligaments and ﬁbers are 
observed for the Thixatrol gel. Breakup of the silica gel is more 
effective at higher M and qualitatively resembles the features ob- 
served for water [275] . With the limited available data, it appears

that the primary breakup of Thixatrol gel propellant is easier. It is 
also expected that the dissipation of air-phase turbulence would 
be affected by the viscosity of the gel propellant. 

5.8.2. Spray cone angle 

A  few  measurements  of  the  full  spray-cone  angle  (2 α’ ) 
have  been  reported  for  the  gel  propellants  and  simulants 
[ 27 , 45 , 46 , 52 , 256 ],  as  shown  in  Fig.  93 .  Parametric  effects  of  the 
nozzle angles (2 β) in ﬂat fan nozzles [256] , viscoelasticity [256] , 
impingement angles (2 θ ) in the doublet and triplet impinging jets 
[ 45 , 46 , 276 ], different two-ﬂuid atomizers [ 27 , 52 ], gellant concen- 
tration ( Y G ) [46] , and the type of gellants [27] are embedded in the 
available data on 2 α’ . Cone angles have been measured for varia- 
tions in the momentum ﬂux ratio ( M ) [ 27 , 52 ], injection pressure 
( P 

inj ) [45] , volumetric ﬂow rate ( Q ) [256] , and We 
Note that similar trends as shown in Fig. 93 a for M can be ob- 
served in the two-ﬂuid atomizers if the data are plotted against 
GLR when the ﬂow rate of one ﬂuid is ﬁxed. Similarly, trends ob- 
inj in Fig. 93 b can also be observed if plotted against 
served with P 
j ) in a doublet impinging jet or a ﬂat fan noz- 
the jet velocity ( u 
zle ( Fig. 93 c). Trends observed with We 
gel  and shown in Fig. 93 d 
are also observed with Re gen . However, current debate on the va- 
lidity of We 
gel and uncertainty associated with the surface tension 
of Carbopol gels (see discussion in Section 4.9 and Ref. [47] ), as 
well as lack of information on the spatial dependence of Re gen sug- 
gests that the trends against We 
gel should be considered a tentative 
proposal. 

gel [46] . 

Fig. 93 suggests that the conditions imparting larger momen- 
tum to the jet or sheet of gel for a given atomizer could contract 
the spray-cone, as in all atomizer conﬁgurations shown in Fig. 93 , 
or have minimal effect (see Figs. 93a-93c ). Factors rooted in the 
breakup mechanism [52] and elastic recoil with higher extensional 
viscosity [ 46 , 256 ] could be identiﬁed by the visualizations and rhe- 
ology of the gels for explaining these observations. 

81 

Fig. 93 a also shows an example of the variations in 2 α’ with 
the type of particulate gellant. The scatter in data suggests that the 
gellant effects are minimal in this case, perhaps due to their partic- 
ulate nature and largely similar breakup mechanisms and regimes 
from only one type of atomizer (see Section 5.5.3 and Fig. 78 ). 

Another two-ﬂuid atomizer, the internally impinging atomizer 
[ 49 , 52 ], produces narrower cone angles for Jet A1-Thixatrol ST gel 
propellant ( ●) than the coaxial airblast atomizer ( ●). These cone 
angles are closer to the cone angles typically produced in an ef- 
fervescent atomizer [294] and they are obtained at GLR lower than 
the coaxial airblast atomizer. Further, at least in some cases, small 
changes  in  the  breakup  regimes  could  also  cause  the  observed 
trends, as probably in the case of Figs. 93 b and 93 d. 

The opposite trend in two different Carbopol 941 gellant con- 
centrations ( ●, ◦ in Fig. 93 d) is also considered an example of this 
situation in which, only an expanding sheet could form [46] . Wider 
nozzle and impingement angles always expand the full spray-cone 
angle ( Figs. 93b-93d ). Viscoelasticity is observed to restrict the ex- 
pansion of spray cone, as seen from Fig. 93 c. 

Recently, Kim et al. [143] have reported the cone angles for dif- 
ferent  compositions  of  Jet  A1  gel  propellants  in  which  the  con- 
centration and particle size of micro-Al was varied. The gel pro- 
pellants  are  similar  to  the  ones  used  by  Ciezki  et  al.  [27]  and 
Padwal  and  Mishra  [ 44 , 49 , 52 ].  Kim  et  al.  [143]  have  also  com- 
pared the cone angles with Jet A1. The reported data are shown in 
Fig. 94 . 

The contraction of cone angles for gel propellants is clearly vis- 
ible  and  it  is  commensurate  with  the  increase  in  the  viscoelas- 
ticity  (as  inferred  from  the  relaxation  time  data  [143] ),  in  ac- 
cordance with the previous observations of Thompson and Roth- 
stein [256] (see Fig. 93 c). Relative trends between different micro- 
Al  particle  sizes  ( D 43 = 10,  54  μm)  are  however  not  clear  and 
the  relaxation  time  data  show  non-monotonic  dependence  on 
D 43 .

[ 39 , 45 , 47 , 50 , 77 , 109 , 120 , 222 , 223 , 226 , 231 ], 

A  sizable  experimental  database  for  the  droplets  size  dis- 
tributions  and  their  statistics  like  Sauter  mean  diameter 
( D 32 ),  mass  median  diameter  ( D 0.5 ),  and  average  diameter 
( D 10 )  is  now  available  for  many  combinations  of  atomiz- 
ers  and  gel  propellants  or  their  simulants.  In  particular,  we 
consider  the  data  for  the  conventional  doublet  impinging 
jets 
imping- 
ing  jets  [ 17 , 82 , 231 ],  quadruplet  impinging  jets  [231] ,  airblast 
[ 102 , 103 , 157 , 235 ],  and  effervescent  [ 110 , 195 , 295 ]  atomizers,  fol- 
lowed by a couple of improved atomizer designs [ 21 , 49 , 52 , 110 , 111 ]. 
However,  such  data  are  not  currently  available  for  the  pressure 
swirl atomizers. Teske and Bilanin [296] have attempted data re- 
duction for many viscoelastic ﬂuids using a form of dimensionless 
groups  for  the  non-Newtonians.  Further,  the  available  data  have 
been  presented  in  literature  with  reference  to  the  parameters 
of  the  given  atomizer,  among  which,  we  choose  the  GLR  and  u 
j 
and also use the dimensionless droplet size ( D mn /d o ) to compare 
multiple datasets. Fig. 95 shows the data compiled for airblast and 
effervescent atomizers in Figs. 95 a and 95 b, respectively. Doublet 
impinging jets are covered in Figs. 96 and 97 and triplet impinging 
jets are covered in Fig. 98 .

[ 110 , 195 , 295 ]. 

Mansour  and  Chigier  [157]  atomized  water,  visco-inelastic 
water-XG,  and  viscoelastic  water-PAA  E10  solutions  in  a  coaxial 
airblast  atomizer.  The  representative  data  for  the  concentrations 
of solutions found to be most diﬃcult to atomize are compared 
against  water  in  Fig.  95 a  in  terms  of  the  Sauter  mean  diameter 
( D 32 ). For the solutions considered, the viscoelastic solution is most 
diﬃcult to atomize in comparison to non-Newtonian visco-inelastic 
solution and water. The required GLR range to obtain the droplet 
sizes  is  typical  of  the  airblast  designs,  irrespective  of  the  non- 
Newtonian nature of XG and E10 solutions. Mansour and Chigier 
[157] also reported a detailed analysis of the droplet size depen- 
dence on the Weber and Ohnesorge numbers. The analysis and the 
visualization of breakup of droplets from ligaments suggested that 
the droplet size data of non-Newtonian shear thinning and visco- 
inelastic water-XG solutions could be reduced using essentially the 
same correlations as found useful in the past for water-like New- 
tonians. However, the exponent of Oh in general depends on the 
viscosity (or shear rate) of the ﬂuid in the oriﬁce. In this respect, 
it should be noted that some studies [ 17 , 19 , 52 , 77 , 82 ] have taken 
cognizance of the fact that it is essential to refer the Re gen and Oh 
estimates to an appropriate location within the injector while at- 
tempting the data reduction. Guglielmi’s data for JP-10-B 
4 C gelled 
slurry  propellants (consisting of 38 % JP-10,  50 % B 
4 C, unknown 
gellant, a catalyst, and small quantity of Mg) [102] is also plotted 
in Fig. 95 a to indicate the variations expected when similar pro- 
pellant compositions intended for ramjet combustion are atomized

in airblast atomizers of different types. These atomizers (Monarch 
C-170-WA and Delavan Swirl-Air® 32740) were selected based on 
their ability to give D 32 ∼40-50 μm [102] (considered essential for 
ramjets [102] ). The reported droplet sizes in Fig. 95 a show that it 
is possible to obtain the required droplet sizes when using these 
atomizers. The scatter in the data could result from inhomogeneity 
of the propellant or changes in the concentration during atomiza- 
tion. The datasets of different airblast atomizers seem to cluster in 
a region. It should be noted that the data of Mansour and Chigier

diffraction. 

Fig. 95 b shows the D 32 - GLR proﬁles obtained for effervescent 
atomizers, including the low-viscosity Newtonian Jet A1, highly vis- 
cous Newtonian glycerin-water solutions, and shear thinning vis- 
coelastic solutions of glycerin and water mixed with cellulose and 
PEO  polymers.  In  this  case  also,  for  a  given  effervescent  atom- 
izer, the viscoelastic solutions are more diﬃcult to atomize. An or- 
der of magnitude decrease in the required GLR is usually possible 
when using an effervescent atomizer instead of an airblast atom- 
izer [294] . This advantage of effervescent atomizer is also noticed 
in Fig. 95 b. Buckner et al. [295] suggest that the contacting pattern 
developed between the ﬂuid and air inside the atomizer is respon- 
sible for this improvement. It is also indicated that the decrease in 
viscosity might also be accompanied by an instability on the sur- 
face of liquid in contact with air if an appropriate ﬂow regime is 
established [ 294 , 295 ]. 

Injector parameter, the ratio ( d o / u 

j ) between the oriﬁce diame- 
ter ( d o ) and jet velocity ( u 
j ), is an important variable for the im- 
pinging jets because it is useful to compare the data of different 
impinging jets and varying jet velocities, as shown in Fig. 96 for 
doublet  impinging  jets  ( d o = 0.5-1.5  mm,  2 θ = 50 o -100 o ).  A  large 
number of data collected for different gel propellants or their sim- 
ulants  [ 39 , 45 , 47 , 50 , 77 , 109 , 120 , 223 , 297 ]  and  water  [ 39 , 45 , 47 , 223 ] 
are compiled in this ﬁgure. 

Most of the data points represent the breakup regimes inﬂu- 
enced by impact waves. Under these conditions, it is observed that 
the  injector  parameter  range  for  gel  propellants  that  can  be  at- 
omized in the impact wave regime is ∼10 −5 -10 −4 . Although not 
comprehensive,  the  droplet  size  data  fall  on  the  higher  side  of 
this range. Therefore, we can conclude that the doublet imping- 
ing jets are capable of atomization of gel propellants provided in- 
jectors of smaller oriﬁce diameter or higher jet injection velocities 
are employed. The D 32 values obtained under such favorable con- 
ditions  would  be  similar  to  a  low-viscosity  Newtonian  ﬂuid  like 
water. Moreover, the trends in D 32 are similar between the New- 
tonian and the gel propellants of complex rheological properties. 
Spread in the data also suggests that a limiting droplet size range 
is reached for smaller ( d o /u 

j ). 

Some interesting features of atomization of metalized gel pro- 
pellants are to be found in the data of Madlener et al. [169] . Jet 
A1-7.5 % Thixatrol ST-7.5 % MIAK gel propellant was metalized us- 
Al = 0-40 %, D 50 = 1.22 μm and D 32 = 0.76 
ing micro-Al particles ( Y 
μm)  and  then  atomized  using  a  doublet  impinging  jet  atomizer 
( d o = 0.7 mm, 2 θ = 90 o ). Droplet size distributions were then mea- 
sured  using  Fraunhofer  diffraction  and  the  rheological  behavior 
of  these  gels  was  modeled  using  the  extended  HB  (HBE)  equa- 
tion.  The  Sauter  mean  diameters  ( D 32 )  of  the  droplets  are  plot-

tained. 

We observe from Fig. 97 a that the sprays of metalized gel pro- 
pellants could actually produce ﬁner droplets than Jet A1 ( ●), al- 
Al = 10- 
though within a restricted u 
j . Among the metalized cases ( Y 
Al = 40 % are the smallest. Moreover, for the

dynamically  similarly  balanced  conditions  (i.e.  similar  Re gen,HBE ), 
Fig.  97 b  reveals  that  the  more  viscous  metalized  gel  propellants 
could produce smaller droplets than Jet A1. Here again, droplets 
Al = 40 % are the smallest among all tested propellants.

The variations of rheological parameters K, n , and τ

yield of the 
HBE model discussed previously in Sections 4.3 and 4.6.1 indicate 
that within the experimental uncertainty levels, viscous behavior 
( K ) and yield stresses generally increased with metalization, while 
the shear thinning ( n ) remained similar. Thus, conventionally, the 
metalized  gels  are  supposed  to  be  diﬃcult  to  ﬂow  by  virtue  of 
their higher yield stresses and viscous resistance. These results in- 
dicate that the general notion of gel propellants being ’diﬃcult to 
atomize’ is not always valid and clearly, the induced extreme shear 
thinning of particulate gels and metal particle-mediated breakup 
processes (see Section 5.5.2 and Ref. [79] ) are the two very im- 
portant enabling factors in the atomization of metalized gel pro- 
pellants. In other words, the effects of τ
yield and K are conﬁned to 
low or very low shear rates and they hardly affect the atomization 
processes occurring at high levels of shear. 

Triplet  impinging  jets  in  which,  a  round  jet  of  propellant  is 
impinged upon by two round jets of oxidizer, have been utilized 
for water-Carbopol ETD 2050 gel propellant simulants [ 17 , 82 ] and

their modiﬁcation using the pulsatile injection of propellant jet has 
also been demonstrated [21] . Nitrogen jets were used to impinge 
upon the simulant jet in these studies. Fig. 98 shows the trends in 
D 32 with changes in GLR . Variations in the GLR were obtained by 
varying the ﬂow rates of simulant gel and nitrogen. Note that u 
j is 
signiﬁcantly smaller in the triplet impinging jets than the doublet 
impinging jets and the oxidizer jets impart kinetic energy required 
to form an unstable sheet and atomize the gel. 

The experimental data have been reduced in the form of an em- 
pirical correlation shown in the inset of Fig. 98 according to which, 
the droplet size decreases with increase in the ﬂow rate of oxi- 
dizer ( ˙ m a ) and increases with increase in the ﬂow rate ( ˙ m

the  ’resistance’  due  to  the  additional  mass  (embedded  in  ˙ m 2 . 34 
gel  ) 
which  can  result  in  the  increase  of  sheet  thickness.  The  depen- 
dence on ˙ m 

gel is especially strong. 

Droplet size distributions are actually measured experimentally 
(except in the photographic methods) and size statistics are esti- 
mated from such distributions. In this respect, a couple of studies 
reported Rosin-Rammler distribution parameters [ 47 , 50 ] obtained 
by curve ﬁtting. Majority of the reported droplet size distributions 
of the gel propellants and their simulants [ 45 , 47 , 50 , 52 , 77 , 82 , 111 ] 
are bimodal or multimodal, except for the case reported by Fakhri 
et al. [223] . Hence, the simpliﬁed Rosin-Rammler functions do not 
always reasonably characterize the data. No systematic effort has 
been initiated on the origin of multimodal distributions although 
distinct sources of droplet generation [111] have been suggested. 
The  inhomogeneity  of  properties  of  the  gels  during  atomization 
further complicates the situation [ 77 , 79 ]. 

In the literature, droplet size data have also been collected to 
study  the  parametric  effects  of  gellant  and  metal  particle  con- 
centration [ 21 , 77 , 109 , 195 , 295 ], location of droplet ensemble after 
breakup [ 39 , 47 , 50 , 52 , 82 , 222 , 223 ], ﬂow rates of propellant and ox- 
idizer [ 52 , 82 ], different atomizers [ 102 , 103 ], variations in atomizer 
geometric parameters [ 45 , 49 , 50 ], etc. 

Improved atomizers for gel propellants have been designed to 
reduce  the  droplet  size  so  that  ramjet  combustion  applications 
become  accessible.  Data  shown  in  Fig.  99  suggest  that  droplet 
sizes in the sub-50 μm class have been obtained using these at- 
omizers  [ 21 , 49 , 52 , 110 , 111 , 248 , 298 ]  under  normal  ambient  condi- 
tions. We further consider the comparisons with other atomizers 
in  Section  5.9.4 .  Fig.  99 a  shows  the  droplet  size  data  obtained 
when the round propellant jet were perturbed by the teeth of a 
pair of wheels [21] (see also, Section 5.3.1 , Fig. 68 b) rotated at cer- 
tain frequency ( f ). 

Fig. 99 a clearly shows the improvement in the performance of 
the resulting triplet impinging jet atomizer with ’pulsatile injec- 
tion’ of propellant jet. The exact mechanism of the breakup of the 
perturbed jet by the pair of nitrogen gas jets is not reported yet 
and information on other spray properties is also lacking. Jet di- 
ameter of appropriate magnitude should be chosen for the pertur- 
bation to be effective [21] . Bimodal droplet size distributions were 
obtained irrespective of the pulsation frequency in these experi- 
ments. However, the contribution of smaller size-class droplets in- 
creased with the perturbation frequency driving down the D 32 in 
the 10-80 μm range. 

Sutherland et al. [ 248 , 298 ] showed that the porous insert (see 
also Section 5.3.1 , Fig. 68 a) upstream of the oriﬁce of a conven- 
tional  effervescent  atomizer  would  also  signiﬁcantly  reduce  the 
size  of  the  resulting  droplets  while  retaining  the  advantage  of 

small atomizing air mass. The modiﬁed atomizer has been tested 
on a number of ﬂuids as shown in Fig. 99 b. 

Droplet size data collected on the internally impinging atom- 
izer (see Section 5.3.3 and Fig. 70 ) for three ﬂuids; water, Jet A1, 
and Jet A1 gel propellant are shown in Fig. 99 c. The droplets are 
in the D 32 = 10-70 μm range [ 49 , 52 , 110 , 111 ]. The required droplet 
sizes  are  achieved  in  the  GLR  range  similar  to  the  usual  oper- 
ating  range  of  conventional  effervescent  atomizer  as  well  as  in 
the  higher  GLR  range.  Further,  the  upper  limit  of  the  operating 
GLR range is also considerably smaller than the conventional air- 
blast atomizers. A correlation involving M, Oh , and GLR with the 
droplet size ( D 32 ) for the internally impinging atomizer has been 
reported  by  Padwal  and  Mishra  [52]  in  the  range  M = 2 × 10 3 - 
1.15 × 10 6 ,  Oh = 0.6-3,  and  GLR = 0.027-0.64,  in  the  form:  D 32 = 
32 in μm). It is based on the di-

mensional  analysis  of  the  breakup  and  atomization  process  in- 
volved in the internally impinging atomizer [52] . Results of the di- 
mensional analysis suggest that the segregation of effects in terms 
of the dimensionless groups has not been achieved yet and more 
work is necessary in this direction before an improved empirical 
correlation emerges. 

5.8.4. Wave properties 

Characterization  of  the  impact  wave  regime,  also  described 
sometimes as ligament structures [ 36 , 81 ], invariably requires the 
knowledge of wavelength ( λ), frequency ( f ), and propagation speed 
( u p ) of the surface waves. Different instability mechanisms for the 
jets and ligaments are also characterized by wave properties. As 
described subsequently in Section 5.9.2 , wave properties are also 
important in the characterization of combustion instability induced 
by  the  impinging  jet  atomizers  [299] .  At  present,  the  reports  of 
combustion instability during combustion of gel propellants (met- 
alized or otherwise) are lacking. Still, considerable effort has been 
devoted towards the estimation of wave properties involved in the 
primary and secondary breakup stages of the gel propellants us- 
ing the impinging jet, pressure swirl, and plain oriﬁce atomization 
methods [ 46 , 48 , 77 , 81 , 120 , 126 , 134 , 191 , 226 ]. Spatio-temporal analy- 
sis  of  the  pixel  intensities  performed  on  the  images  of  a  high- 
speed visualization of the impact waves is a convenient method 
to extract these properties [77] . 

Goldin  and  coworkers  [ 126 , 191 ]  studied  the  wave-based 
breakup of many gel propellants and viscoelastic solutions by us- 
ing the plain oriﬁce atomization of laminar jets as a function of jet 
velocity. Yang et al. [134] attempted to impart surface disturbances 
on the jet by resonating waves and then measured the wavelength 
of the impact waves. The limited available data suggest that within 
the reported uncertainty limits, the diameter of resonating cham- 
ber did not affect the wavelength of impact waves at any of the 
injection pressures. 

Figs. 100 and 101 summarize the available data on the prop- 
erties of impact waves collected from the experimental studies, in 
which the gel propellant [77] or simulants [ 46 , 48 ] were used. Com- 
parison is also drawn against the data available on water [ 81 , 300 ] 
and Newtonian ﬂuids [208] . All datasets are for the doublet im- 
pinging jets. As shown, the wavelength is non-dimensionalized us- 
ing  the  oriﬁce  diameter  and  expressed  as  the  Strouhal  number 
( St = d o / λ). 

Fig. 100 a shows the scatter plot between St and jet We . Coupled 
level set-volume of ﬂuid simulations of Chen et al. [300] show that 
the St-We relationship can be divided into a linear region, in which 
the St increases linearly with We and the second region, in which 
the St is largely independent of We . Drawing on the similarity of 
this trend with the one found in case of free shear layers; Chen 
et al. [300] concluded that the impact waves are analogous to the 
unstable free shear layers. Their analysis also revealed that the im-

pact waves are controlled by the interaction of shear layers formed 
on the either side of the sheet in the post-impingement regions. 

Evidence of the observed linear trend between St and We for 
water  can  be  also  found  in  water-1  %  Carbopol  941-NaOH  gel 
once  the  data  reported  by  Lee  and  Koo  [46]  are  converted  into 
St  and  We  ( (cid:2)).  Similar  conversion  also  revealed  that  the  data 
for water ( (cid:3)) [81] and water-2 % polysaccharide [48] follow the 
same linear trend. Remaining datasets show a considerable scatter. 
Among these, the scatter in the dataset for ISROsene gel propellant 
[77] that consists of different nano-Al 
3  concentrations is most 
probably due to the inhomogeneity in local concentration at the 
sheet surface [79] . Generally, longer λ found for the gels indicates 
damping of instability on the surface as a consequence of higher 
viscosity, and, almost certainly, due to other unknown rheological 
effects. 

2 O 

Ramasubramanian  et  al.  [81]  concluded  that  the  waves  of 
shorter wavelength cause an early breakup of sheet, resulting in 
smaller  breakup  length.  This  behavior  is  depicted  for  water  in 
Fig. 100 b besides the data for ISROsene gel propellant [77] . Evi- 
dently, the data for gel propellant are considerably scattered and 
deﬁnite  conclusions  on  the  behavior  of  sheet  surfaces  disturbed 
by  the  impact  waves  of  shorter  wavelength  cannot  be  drawn  at 
present for gels. 

Rodrigues  et  al.  [183]  measured  the  maximum  wavelengths, 
λmax at the breakup location of aq. CMC sheets formed during dou- 
blet impinging jet atomization. Within the relatively large uncer- 
tainty of measurements, the maximum wavelengths decreased at 
higher Re gen . As discussed in Section 4.6.1 (see Table 10 , Eq. (4) for 
a = 2), Re gen was estimated using the Bird-Carreau model [183] . 

Another potentially important result related to the wave prop- 
agation velocity ( u p ) of the impact waves is shown in Fig. 101 a, in 
which the propagation velocity estimated from the spatio-temporal 
analysis of impact waves ( u p = λf ) is plotted against the jet velocity

( u 

j ). u p can be assumed close to the sheet velocity ( u

sheet and 
u 
j  given by Heislbetz et al. [208] for the Newtonian sheets. Inset 
of Fig. 101 a shows the correlation for a sheet of kerosene [208] . 
Jejurkar  et  al.  [77]  showed  that  the  non-Newtonian  gels  do  not 
conﬁrm to this simple linear relationship. They also suggest that 
the usual assumption of u p ∼u 
j [301] is invalid for the gel propel- 
lant sheets (see also Ref. [136] ). Conﬁrmation of these ﬁndings has 
been found in the additional measurements as provided by Collins 
et al. [136] . 

It  is  now  clear  that  the  future  analytical  treatments  of  the 
sheet atomization of gel propellants should consider this complex- 
ity, given the inﬂuence of impact waves on the breakup structures. 
In this respect, Collins et al. [136] have examined the commonly 
held assumptions of u

used in the impinging jets. With the help of aq. CMC and XG gels,

5.8.5. Hole dynamics on sheet surface 

Characterization of nucleation and growth of holes on the sur- 
face of a sheet has been undertaken by Thompson and Rothstein 
[256] for the ﬂat fan nozzle and recently by Jejurkar et al. [77] for 
the impinging jets in different breakup regimes (see Section 5.5.2 ). 
Thompson and Rothstein [256] explained the growth dynamics of 
holes according to the elasticity of the CTAB-NaSal ﬂuids. As shown 
in Fig. 102 a, the holes nucleate closer to the nozzle and their av- 
erage diameters are larger if the elasticity number ( El ) deﬁned us- 
ing  the  zero  shear  rate  viscosity, η0  and  nozzle  radius,  R n  ( El = 
λη0 / ρR 2 
n ) is large. Thompson and Rothstein [256] attribute this be- 
havior to the release of elastic potential energy and also observe 
that the growth rate over long time is determined by a balance 
between the capillary and extensional stresses while the inertial 
forces do not play a signiﬁcant role. Evers et al. [302] analyzed the 
behavior of thin CTAB ﬁlms for elucidating the hole dynamics and 

86 

estimated the ﬁlm rupture velocity using a modiﬁed energy bal- 
ance in which the elasticity effects were incorporated. 

2 O 

Hole growth tracked in the ISROsene gel propellant sheets (con- 
centration of nano-Al 
3 particles is 0 (A0) or 10 % (A10)) is shown 
in Fig. 102 b for the holes nucleated in the peripheral regions lying 
adjacent to the rim of sheet and also for the holes nucleated away 
from the sheet rims in the interior of sheet surface. Only the non- 
wave breakup regimes (rimmed sheets) are included in Fig. 102 b, 
although  growth  of  holes  in  between  the  two  adjacent  impact 
waves has also been considered [79] . We have used the oriﬁce di- 
j ) to non-dimensionalize 
ameter ( d o ) and injector parameter ( d o /u 
the hole diameter ( d 
h ) and time ( t ), respectively. Representation in 
these terms shows that the holes grow at a constant rate irrespec- 
tive of their location and composition of the gel propellant, and 
hence, the rheological properties. 

The lateral shift in A10 case (Al 

3  concentration is 10 wt %) 
is due to the higher u 
j necessary for obtaining the similar regime 
as in A0. The growth of ’pre-hole’ ( ●) is slow but it is observed 
that the hole nucleated from a pre-hole transported on the sheet 
surface follows the general trend in the hole growth. 

2 O 

Unlike the observations of Thompson and Rothstein [256] , the 
hole growth rate ( dd 
h /dt ) is constant for the ISROsene gel propel- 
lant sheets [79] , which affords deﬁnition of a constant hole expan- 
sion velocity ( V e = d d 
h / dt ). We used the estimated values of the 
sheet thickness, t s (using the Culick-like behavior, see [ 79 , 267 ]) and 
V e to deﬁne the dimensionless time ( tV e /t s ) and dimensionless hole 
diameter ( d 
h /t s ). The resulting scatter plot shown in Fig. 102 c re- 
veals that the growth of the holes is correlated in terms of a length 
scale (sheet thickness, t s ) and a velocity scale (expansion velocity, 
V e ) governing the tearing process. 

Hole  nucleation  and  growth  can  be  noticed  in  al- 
most  all  the  visualizations  of  sheet  atomization  of  gels 
[ 36 , 39 , 45 , 47 , 79 , 81 , 143 , 223 , 226 ]  and  other  non-Newtonian  ﬂu- 
ids  [ 225 , 256 ],  irrespective  of  whether  they  involve  polymeric 
or  non-polymeric  gellants.  In  fact,  it  could  be  a  critically  im-

portant  feature  of  the  sheet  atomization  of  gel  propellants  (see 
Section  5.4 ).  Majority  of  the  holes  cluster  close  together  and 
eventually form a network of interconnected ligaments. Droplets 
formed from such ligaments are of the sizes of the same order as 
the characteristic size of these ligaments. Thompson and Rothstein 
[256]  noticed  that  early  growth  of  the  holes  in  ﬂuids  of  higher 
elasticity is also accompanied by a larger fraction of the ruptured 
sheet.  Moreover,  the  interconnecting  ligaments  are  likely  to  be 
thicker if El is high. Hence, the resulting droplets would be larger 
for the ﬂuids of high elasticity. 

5.8.6. Mixing in impinging jets 

Mixing of gel propellants in the impinging jets has received at- 
tention, beginning with the study by Chojnacki and Feikema [159] . 
Their  preliminary  results  were  obtained  with  the  help  of  planar 
LASER induced ﬂuorescence (PLIF), although no quantitative data 
was extracted at the time. Recently however, two studies have ap- 
peared on this topic [ 89 , 303 ] and we discuss their results in this 
section. 

The mixing behavior of impinging jets is of primary interest for 
hypergolic gel propellants because the pre-ignition liquid-phase re- 
actions  between  a  fuel  and  oxidizer  depend  upon  the  extent  of 
mixing.  For  this  purpose,  the  optically  dense  near-ﬁeld,  the  re- 
gion immediately downstream of the impingement point, must be 
probed. X-ray radiography (XRR) and ﬂuorescence (XRF) were used 
to extract quantitative data on the liquid mass and mixing of two 
jets  with  the  help  of  Zn  and  Cu  tracer  species  in  terms  of  the 
equivalent path length ( l p ) [89] . Impingement of the jets of water 
and water-3 % HPC gel propellant simulant was investigated using 
j = 9.1 m/s, 2 θ = 60 o , d o = 0.5 mm, and L PI = 3 mm. 
jets for which u 
Proﬁles of Zn and Cu XRF in terms of l p were used to analyze the 
penetration and mixing of two jets in the xz -plane, as shown in 
Fig. 103 . The mixing occurs by bulk motion of the tracers instead 

of diffusion. The available time scales are too short for diffusive 
mixing in the near-ﬁeld [89] . 

Individual jets compress near the impingement point, as shown 
by the tracer proﬁles at z = 2 mm in Figs. 103 a and 103 c and then 
broaden outwards as the mixing progresses, as shown in Figs. 103 b 
and  103 d  ( z = 4.5  mm).  The  l p  peaks  near  x = 0  are  due  to  the 
formation of sheet. Water-3 % HPC gel jets compressed more, as 
shown in Fig. 103 c due to the suppression of instability [89] . Mix- 
ing in gels was found to be slower considering the vertical span 
mix ∼160 μs. 
required for complete overlap and the mixing time, τ
l p  obtained  by  XRR  elongated  with  attenuation  (more  ﬂuid 
mass) and it could be considered proportional to the sheet thick- 
ness in the yz -plane. As shown in Fig. 104 , the XRR sampled the 
sheet along a given z -location to yield the l p  proportional to the 
local thickness of sheet. Since it is proportional to the attenuation, 
longer l p indicates more mass and hence thicker sheet. 

The water sheet breaks up earlier than gel, as indicated by the 
gradually shrinking l p for water ( ◦, y = ± 1.5 mm) compared to a 
sharp  decrease  for  water-3  %  HPC  gel  in  Fig.  104 a.  The  delayed 
breakup of HPC gel is clearly observed in Fig. 104 b. The intact sheet 
narrows  further  downstream  for  the  gel  and  the  ﬂuid  mass  ap- 
pears to collect near the y = 0 location, as shown by the longer l p 
in Fig. 104 b. 

Notaro et al. [303] recently carried out PLIF visualizations (Rho- 
damine 6G dye and Nd:YAG LASER) of the non-gelled and gelled 
impinging jet sprays operated at high pressures using a setup pre- 
viously  reported  by  Ramasubramanian  et  al.  [81]  (see  also  the 
previous  report  by  Chojnacki  and  Feikema  [159] ).  As  shown  in 
Fig. 105 a, mixing, in terms of the mixing eﬃciency ( η
mix ), was es- 
timated by Eq. (32) .

Z is the mixture ratio and  ˙ m s  is the mass ﬂow rate of spray. 
PLIF data and image processing were used for these estimates. The 
mixing eﬃciency improves with chamber pressure ( P C ), as shown 
in Fig. 105 a. However, the situation is considerably complicated by 
the emergence of impact wave based or prompt breakup regimes 
(discussed in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 ) along with the effects of gas 
phase drag on the sheet stability at higher P C [303] . 

Complexities due to the higher momentum and turbulence of 
water jet tend to induce pre-impingement instabilities and dimin- 
ish the mixing eﬃciency [303] . However, dominance of momentum 
induced  mixing  at  higher  jet  velocities  ( u 
j )  tend  to  improve  the 
mixing of water jets over the gel simulant. The outcome of these 
effects is shown in Fig. 105 b. The interplay of aerodynamic effects 
noted above and the superimposed inﬂuence of nonlinear rheolog- 
ical properties and the presence of particulate silica in the gel sim- 
ulant leads to non-monotonic variations in mixing eﬃciency. Fur- 
ther, it should be noted that the delayed appearance of breakup 
regimes in the gels leads to the possibility that the compared con- 
ditions could not have been reasonably matched in some instances. 

5.8.7. Miscellaneous properties 

We now brieﬂy summarize some studies reporting the miscella- 
neous properties of gel sprays other than the ones discussed in the 
preceding sections. Discharge characteristics of atomizers in terms 
of the ﬂow rates, ﬂow number, and discharge coeﬃcient as well 
as the parametric effects of atomizer conﬁguration, pressure drop, 
and gellant concentration were measured in some cases. Among 
them,  Yang  et  al.  [134]  for  modiﬁed  impinging  jets,  Rahimi  and 
Natan for the triplet impinging jets [82] , Yang et al. [160] for the 
pressure swirl atomizer, and Jayaprakash and Chakravarthy for the 
doublet impinging jets [45] , are some notable studies. 

Negri  et  al.  [211]  measured  the  lengths  of  continuous  trans- 
verse  ligaments  ( L t  or  ’thread  parameter’  [211] )  formed  during 
the  impinging  jet  atomization  of  Boger  ﬂuids  composed  of  PEO. 
Their  results  show  a  good  correlation  with  the  relaxation  time 
( λ) associated with the extensional thickening of viscoelastic non- 
Newtonians but no clear dependence on We, Oh , and shear viscos- 
ity was observed due to signiﬁcant scatter in the data. Increased 
relaxation time increased the thread parameter. As mentioned pre- 
viously, extensional thickening means increased extensional viscos- 
ity ( ηext ) and relaxation time ( λ), a direct cause for the diminished 
possibility of breakup. 

Ma et al. [50] , Rodrigues and Sojka [222] reported the detailed 
phase Doppler data for doublet impinging jets. Ma et al. [50] found 
a positive correlation between the mean droplet axial velocity and 
droplet diameters. Rodrigues and Sojka [222] compared the data 
for 1 % agar and 1 % κ-Carrageenan with water and found that 
the axial velocities of the relatively larger droplets of the gels were 
also larger than water. 

5.9. Atomizer performance 

Performance of the atomizers used for gel propellant atomiza- 
tion can be characterized in the same terms as used for Newtonian 
ﬂuids. Based on the reported studies in literature on gel propel- 
lants, we discuss the atomizer performance in terms of the rhe- 
ological effects, combustion instability, and atomization eﬃciency. 
We  also  compare  multiple  two-ﬂuid  atomizers  in  terms  of  their 
ability to produce sprays considered useful for ramjet propulsion 
applications. 

5.9.1. Rheological effects 

Mallory and Sojka [120] measured the ratio between the diame- 
ters of droplets ( d 
lig ) formed in the impinging 
jet atomization of three water-based inelastic organogels and com-

lig similar to the Newtonians. However, the ratio ( d 
is  always  smaller  than  the  value  1.89  reported  for  Newtonians 
[304] and increases with viscosity. These results show that while 
it is considered diﬃcult to produce smaller droplets from the gels 
when compared with a Newtonian liquid, smaller ratios obtained 
here suggest that smaller droplets could be possibly produced in 
some cases. However, proper comparison would require matched 
breakup regime.

Padwal and Mishra [111] experimentally obtained the variations 
in droplet size (expressed as D 32 ) with shear viscosity of Jet A1 gel 
propellant by employing the internally impinging two-ﬂuid atom- 
ization method. The viscosity upstream of the impingement plane 
was controlled by varying the ﬂow rate of gel propellant at a con- 
stant ﬂow rate of the atomizing air. For a ﬁxed ﬂow rate of air, they 
parameterized  the  data  by  the  air-phase  Weber  number  ( W e g = 
a d a ) /σ ) and the resulting trends are shown in Fig. 106 b.

Under  the  inﬂuence  of  a  given  inertia  force  imparted  by  the 
eight impinging microjets of air on the gel propellant jet, a higher 
mass ﬂow rate of the propellant resulted in higher shear rate, a 
concomitant decrease in the viscosity of the gel prior to the im- 
pingement, and hence, a reduction in the droplet size, as shown in 
Fig. 106 b. Higher inertia force from the air impingement progres- 
sively reduced the droplet size further, while retaining a similar 
dependence on the apparent shear viscosity of the gel propellant 
in terms of the D 32 - η relationship. 

In  the  experiments  performed  on  water-Carbopol  gels  by

ﬂuid atomizers that could be considered for gel propellants. All the 
atomizers currently being considered for the gel fuels convert the 
kinetic energy of atomizing air or fuel jet to overcome the resis- 
tance to disturbance offered by viscosity, and to a less extent, by 
surface tension of the gels. Atomization results in an increase in 
the total surface area of liquid. Atomization eﬃciency could then 
be deﬁned as the ratio of energy required to atomize (increase the 
surface  area)  and  the  kinetic  energy  of  atomization  air  [260] .  A 
comparison of the experimental droplet size data and the average 
fuel jet velocities among Newtonian ﬂuids and gels indicate that 
the eﬃciency of impinging jets used for the gels is considerably 
less than the impinging jets used for Newtonian ﬂuids. However, 
atomization eﬃciency is very much dependent on the atomizer de- 
sign, especially on the contacting pattern between the atomizing 
gas and liquid. 

The eﬃciency estimates in some cases could be obtained using 
Lefebvre’s method for prompt atomization [260] . Atomizers used 
at  present  for  gel  propellants  approach  prompt  atomization  un- 
der the severe operating conditions (see Sections 5.4.3 and 5.5.2 c ). 
We therefore compared the performance of airblast atomizers used 
for non-Newtonian highly viscous shear-thinning ﬂuids including 
water gel [82] , polymeric solutions of Opadry-HPMC, Opadry-PVA, 
and 85 % Glycerol [233] , as well as Xanthan® and PAA [157] . These 
atomizers are chosen because they typically produce ligaments and 
droplets  simultaneously  by  using  impinging  jets  or  plain-jet  air- 
blast, contacting patterns that are considered by Lefebvre as capa- 
ble of approaching the prompt breakup [260] . ηatom was computed 
using Eq. (33) [260] and the results are compiled in Table 19 , along 
with relevant data. In Table 19 , η denotes the shear viscosity and 
ηatom is used for atomization eﬃciency.

Based  on  the  comparison  of  shear  viscosities  for  ˙ γ = 30  s −1 , 
third column of Table 19 suggests that these shear-thinning non- 
Newtonian ﬂuids are moderately viscous. Shear rates of this level 
are  usually  reached  prior  to  the  contact  between  atomizing  air 
and ﬂuids. Even with smaller viscosities, the range of GLR s sug- 
gests that a large proportion by mass of the atomizing air is neces- 
sary for these atomizers [ 82 , 157 , 233 ] to achieve acceptable droplet 
sizes. Therefore, atomization eﬃciency is smaller than 0.01 for the 
airblast atomizers used in Refs. [ 82 , 157 , 233 ]. 

He  et  al.  [309]  also  analyzed  the  atomization  eﬃciency  of 
an  improved  preﬁlming  airblast  atomizer  used  for  pseudoplas- 
tic non-particulate ﬂuids (ABS-CMC-STPP-Na 
4 -water in 
the mass ratio 30:1.4:30:6:25.6:7). Atomizer described by them is 
reported  to  be  far  more  eﬃcient  than  the  conventional  designs. 
Ability to achieve prompt breakup thus has potential to increase 
the atomization eﬃciency by a sizable fraction.

Contacting patterns maintaining a prolonged contact between 
the atomizing gas and liquid, for example pressure swirl and effer- 
vescent atomizers; are expected to perform better than the airblast 
and triplet impinging jet atomizers considered above. Recently, an- 
other  contacting  pattern  has  emerged  in  the  form  of  internally 
impinging jets [ 49 , 52 , 110 , 111 ], which establishes the required pro- 
longed contact with liquid jet and could lead to a high atomization 
eﬃciency during the atomization of gel propellants. Evidently, per- 
formance improvement could be obtained if required droplet size 
is achieved at GLR s much smaller than possible with the atomizers 
of Table 19 .

water  gel  mass  ﬂow  rate  thickens  the  sheet  and  may  delay  the 
breakup  and/or  produce  larger  ligaments  and  droplets.  The  de- 
creased apparent shear viscosity at higher gel ﬂow rates opposes 
this effect. However, decrease in the viscosity seems to be a mi- 
nor effect in their experiments and thickness of the sheet governs 
the ﬁnal droplet size, such that larger droplets are always expected 
when  the  gel  mass  ﬂow  rate  is  increased.  Urbon  [103]  obtained 
similar trends on an ultrasonic atomizer. 

5.9.2. Combustion instability 

Multiple static ﬁrings of the laboratory-scale rocket motors have 
been conducted to date using different metalized gel propellants. 
These studies are comprehensively discussed in Section 6.9 . How- 
ever, there are currently no reports to our knowledge on combus- 
tion instabilities encountered in gel propellant combustion. How- 
ever, at least one study [77] attempted to characterize the possibil- 
ity of combustion instability when the like-on-like impinging jets 
were used to obtain gel propellant sprays. Jejurkar et al. [77] ex- 
tracted the properties of impact waves using high-speed imaging 
and image processing. As shown in Fig. 107 , it was found that fre- 
quency of the wave propagation is in the range where combus- 
tion  instability  could  occur.  Their  conclusion  is  based  on  a  cor- 
relation previously established by Hewitt [305] in which the fre- 
quency of impact waves is compared against the injector parame- 
ter of the involved combination of doublet impinging jets. As evi- 
dent in Fig. 107 , the correlation has proved reliable [306] for liquid 
propellants when the data of different engines are plotted in terms 
of these coordinates. 

It is observed that the impinging jet atomization of gel propel- 
lants loaded with (0-20 %) nano-Al 
3 particles could produce im- 
2 O 
pact waves whose frequency is in the unstable region for some op- 
erating conditions essential to produce an acceptable droplet size 
[77] for a ﬁxed injector oriﬁce diameter ( d o ). Thus, the resulting 
impact wave regime is likely to cause the combustion instability. 
While, a direct correlation between the gel propellant properties 
and the impact wave frequency could not be established, it is pos- 
sible that the necessity of using higher jet velocity ( u 
j ) for over- 
coming the viscous and elastic effects of the gels results in smaller 
than the optimal injector parameter. In comparison to the gel pro- 
pellants, impinging jet atomization of Newtonian ﬂuids of low vis- 
cosity [ 221 , 307 ] results in the impact wave regime at much lower 
velocity and hence injector could perform optimally. 

5.9.3. Atomization eﬃciency 

Available data on the droplet sizes also enabled us to estimate 
the atomization eﬃciency achieved by a few designs of the two- 

5.9.4. Comparison of atomizers 

Common  ground  for  comparing  the  performance  of  different 
atomizer conﬁgurations is still not accessible for gel propellants. 
Qualitative  comparison  can  be  made  in  this  situation  using  the

omization and combustion of Jet A1 gel propellant [56] . Other at- 
omizers do not perform as good as these two atomizers because 
they require signiﬁcantly higher GLR s and otherwise produce large 
droplets. Performance of all the atomizers is expected to improve 
at higher ambient pressures although eﬃciencies would be low. 

Fig.  108 b  shows  the  SMD - GLR  proﬁles  parameterized  by  the 
frequency  of  disturbances  introduced  in  the  gel  fuel  jet  using  a 
pair of wheels in triplet atomization [21] (discussed in detail in 
Sections  5.3.1  and  5.8.3 ).  Pulsatile  injection  clearly  improves  the 
atomization at the same GLR by signiﬁcantly reducing the droplet 
sizes. We have previously discussed ( Fig. 99 a) that the increased 
frequency  of  rotation  of  the  wheels  reduces  D 32 .  This  atomiza- 
tion method is expected to work with higher eﬃciency, with ηatom 
in the range 7.4 × 10 −4 -1.77 × 10 −3 for GLR = 0.31-0.72 when com- 
pared with the data given in Table 19 for the conventional triplet 
airblast atomization (Ref. [82] ), not accounting for the energy in- 
put to the wheels. Additionally, increase in the small-size fraction 
of droplets was also observed in the presence of ’pulsatile injec- 
tion’. Chernov and Natan [21] attributed this shift in favor of the 
small droplet sizes to the mechanical damage of gels at the edges 
of wheel teeth and to a lesser extent on the smaller surface tension 
of gel in comparison to water. 

5.10. Theoretical and numerical analyses 

In this section, we review the results of theoretical and numer- 
ical analyses of atomization processes involving gels. The discus- 
sion in this section complements the description of studies cov- 
ered  previously  in  Sections  4.8.2  and  4.8.3  and  extends  towards 
the multi-dimensional computations, comparison with experimen- 
tal spray properties, and combustion. 

5.10.1. Stability analyses 

Instability  of  the  sheet  formed  after  the  impingement  of  jets 
has been extensively studied in the past. The chief goal of these 
studies has been to predict the breakup length and droplet sizes 
used for the sub-models of primary breakup in the computations 
of  spray  dynamics  and  spray  ﬂames.  Squire  [310]  observed  that 
the sinuous (anti-symmetric) wave is more effective in destabiliz- 
ing the sheet than the dilational (symmetric) wave (see Fig. 58 in 
Section 4.8.3 ). Impact waves discussed in Section 5.5.2 b travel as 
the sinuous disturbances on the surface of sheet. Beginning with 
the results produced by Squire [310] and Weber [311] , the insta- 
bility analyses of sheets and jets have gradually progressed from 
those involving aerodynamic, inertial, and surface forces on an in- 
viscid ﬁlm [310] to those considering viscous forces [304] and non- 
Newtonian effects, the latter in terms of shear-dependent viscos- 
ity and elasticity of the gel propellants, their simulants, and sim- 
ilar  ﬂuids  [ 48 , 120 , 191 , 194 , 195-197 , 228 , 233 , 312 , 313 ].  Aliseda  et  al. 
[233] and Geckler and Sojka [195] have summarized the evolution 
of instability studies of jets. Table 20 provides a few more rele- 
vant instability analyses of sheets and jets involving gel simulants

omization of gel propellants and other non-Newtonian ﬂuids at ambient pressure;

ranges of droplet sizes and one independent variable. For the two- 
ﬂuid atomizers, D 32 and GLR are the convenient variables for this 
purpose. 

Therefore, we show in Fig. 108 a the regions of D 32 - GLR covered 
currently  by  the  selected  atomizers.  The  enclosed  regions  cover 
many  gel  propellants,  their  simulants,  and  similar  ﬂuids,  apart 
from the base liquid propellants. The necessary data were culled 
from the available sources discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
of Section 5.8.3 . D 32  values are scaled with the typical D 32  ( ∼40 
μm) required in ramjet combustion [ 102 , 103 ]. D 32  ∼40 μm also 
corresponds to the droplet sizes responsible for most of the heat 
release in combustion in gas turbines [261] . Fig. 108 a shows that 
the  effervescent  atomizer  [ 195 , 295 ]  and  internally  impinging  at- 
omizer [ 49 , 52 , 110 , 111 ] operate in the GLR range typically found in 
ramjet  combustion  [ 102 , 103 ].  They  are  capable  of  producing  the 
droplets in the sub-40 μm range. The effervescent atomizer has 
not been tested for atomization and combustion of gel propellants. 
On the other hand, the internally impinging atomizer supports at-

also appeared recently [ 251 , 314 ] along with the theoretical predic- 
tions of sheet properties involving power law ﬂuids [ 315 , 316 ]. 

We now discuss the main results of the studies mentioned in 
Table 20 , emphasizing on the comparisons with experimental data. 
Chojnacki and Feikema [228] analyzed the instability of power law

¯βg is the dimensionless growth rate of a sinusoidal wave of di- 
mensionless wavelength given by the wavenumber k . The breakup 
length could be estimated from the sheet radius at breakup. Dom- 
inant wavelength or the breakup wavelength ( λmax ) is estimated 
from  the  wavenumber  ( k max )  corresponding  to  the  maximum 
growth rate ( ¯βg, max ). They also compared the theoretical predic- 
tions with experimental data collected using water-Carbopol 941 
gels and other non-Newtonians. Comparison with the experimental 
data are shown in Fig. 109 a for λmax (in terms of St max = d o / λmax ) 
and in Fig. 109 b for L 

b (in terms of L 

b / d o ). 

Jet Weber number scaled by the impingement half-angle func- 
tion is used in all the plots. Fig. 109 shows that the correspon- 
dence between the predictions of the linear stability theory and 
the experimental data are lacking (within the limitations of exper- 
imental techniques). In particular, the experimental data did not 
show identiﬁable trends. On the other hand, theory over-predicts 
the maximum wavelengths at breakup. Further, the breakup length 
data shown in Fig. 109 b also lack any trends. Comparison with the 
correlations of Huang [292] for the axisymmetric sheets also shows 
that the results obtained on Newtonian sheets are not valid for the 
non-Newtonian ﬂuids. For comparison, the breakup lengths of IS- 
ROsene gel propellant sheets [77] are also shown in Fig. 109 b. In 
that case also, the trends are not observed. 

Apart  from  the  experimental  diﬃculty,  simpliﬁed  rheological 
modeling (speciﬁcally, unaccounted effects of viscoelasticity), and 
the  unknown  effects  of  impact  waves  of  shorter  wavelength  are 
the possible causes for the discrepancies between theory and ex- 
periments  found  in  Fig.  109 a.  In  Section  5.8.1 ,  we  discussed  the 

92 

breakup length data for doublet impinging jets with reference to 
Fig. 90 . The data shown therein exhibit the behavior observed in 
Fig. 109 b. However, it should be noted that the sheets considered 
by Huang [292] and Chojnacki and Feikema [228] are axisymmet- 
ric, i.e. the jets collide head-on (2 θ = 180 o ). 

Baek  et  al.  [47]  used  the  proposals  of  Ryan  et  al.  [221]  to 
compare  their  experimental  breakup  length  data.  Ryan  et  al. 
[221]  based  their  analysis  by  substituting  Squire’s  equation  for 
maximum  growth  rate  [310]  and  Hasson  and  Peck’s  relation  for 
sheet  thickness  [317]  in  the  empirical  expression  proposed  by 
Dombrowski  and  Johns  [304]  to  yield  a  semi-empirical  relation, 
plotted  here  as  Fig.  109 c.  The  model  proposed  by  Ryan  et  al. 
[221] is valid for water and has already been shown by them to 
be rather deﬁcient even for water. Further, the discussion given by 
Ryan et al. [221] is instructive of the complexities involved even 
in the case of water-like Newtonian liquids. The data for water in 
Fig. 109 c agree with this observation. Hence, caution should be ex- 
ercised while interpreting the data for gels. 

Mallory  and  Sojka  [ 120 , 297 ]  used  the  Bird-Carreau  equation 
instead  of  the  power  law  to  model  the  rheology  of  water  gels 
containing  CMC,  agar,  or  κ-Carrageenan  and  derived  a  modi- 
ﬁed  dispersion  relation,  beginning  from  the  expression  of  Dom- 
browski and Johns [304] . Their breakup length data also did not 
show  identiﬁable  trend  with  We  for  the  inelastic  CMC  solutions 
[297] . However, the predicted λmax closely follow the experimen- 
tal data and the predictions of L 
b  signiﬁcantly improved as well 
with  the  application  of  Bird-Carreau  model.  Further,  the  experi- 
mental data of droplet diameters and the predictions of a semi-

be important here.

eff measured at the highest shear rate was used to compare 
the experimental data with model predictions. The importance of 
surface tension has been noted by Aliseda et al. [233] ; according 
to  them,  the  lower  surface  tension  of  polymers  ( σ ∼22  mN/m, 
measured by the du Nouy ring method) is responsible for success- 
ful  atomization  of  polymeric  ﬂuids  involved  in  the  experiments. 
Otherwise, the high viscosity of polymers would not allow small 
droplets.  The  predictions  of  the  resulting  model  (see  Eq.  (16)  in 
Ref. [233] ) are compared in Fig. 110 a with the experimental data 
for the ﬁxed ﬂow rates of air and liquid phases. 

As noted by the authors [233] , estimates of η

eff based on the 
shear rates near the interface of the air and liquid phase are ex- 
pected to improve the model predictions. It is also noted that a 
large fraction of the air injected for atomization is wasted since 
the model considers only the interactions at the interface and still 
obtains good predictions.

Lund  et  al.  [320]  could  be  applicable  to  the  viscoelastic  ﬂuids 
subjected to effervescent atomization. Since the model estimates 
the ligament diameter, combining the ligament formation model 
with viscoelastic properties and dispersion relation of Goren and 
Gottlieb [199] , led to Eq. (36a) given below in the dimensionless 
terms.

We previously discussed the secondary breakup experiments of 
Snyder and Sojka [197] in Section 5.6 with reference to Figs. 83 d 
and 83 e for relatively low We 
d conditions. These experiments were 
performed on water-XG drops and the secondary breakup model 
based on Taylor’s analogy (Taylor Analogy Breakup, TAB) was mod- 
iﬁed to include the elastic effects. The spring-mass analogy was re- 
cast in terms of the Maxwell mechanical model ( Section 4.8.1 and 
Table 13 ) of viscoelasticity for this purpose. A new relation for the 
dist ) was obtained on this basis as 
dimensionless distortion factor ( y 
dist > 1 and 
given below in Eq. (37) . Secondary breakup occurs if y 
the corresponding time instant is compared with the experimen- 
tally determined ’initial breakup time’.

In Eq. (36b) , λ1 and λ2 are respectively the relaxation and retar- 
dation time constants of the viscoelastic ﬂuid, η0 is the low-shear 
rate viscosity, and u avg is average velocity in the tube. Among the 
dimensionless groups found in Eqs. (36a) and ( 36b ), c 1 is a mea- 
sure of the inertial and surface tension forces, while c 2 and c 3 are 
the measures of viscoelasticity. In particular, the parameter c 2  is 
deﬁned as in c 2 = ( λ1 σ / η0 ( d o / 2 ) ) . It is a ratio measuring the com- 
bined effect of elastic, surface tension, and viscous forces and is 
also called the elasto-capillary number. As in the previous mod- 
els, breakup wavelength for the ligaments is the one correspond- 
ing to the maximum growth rate. It is also the length of ligament. 
Thus, the droplet diameter could be estimated from the volume of 
the most unstable ligament, in the absence of secondary breakup. 
Above predictive model was tested on different PEO-based solu- 
tions for which the experimental data on D 32 were obtained on a 
LASER diffraction instrument. The resulting comparisons are shown 
in Fig. 110 b. The model predictions follow the expected trends in 
experimental data, a fast decrease in D 32 at low GLR , followed by a 
reduced dependence as the GLR increases. The model could also 
follow  the  change  in  viscoelasticity  with  concentration  [195] .  It 
is somewhat deﬁcient in accuracy, probably due to the inﬂuence 
of non-linear viscoelastic effects. According to Geckler and Sojka 
2 β g << 1, i.e. if the ﬂuid is 
[195] , the model validity diminishes if ( c 
very weakly elastic) and also if the errors are accumulated in the 
measurement of viscoelastic time scales. 

Within the linear stability framework, Yang et al. [312] exam- 
ined  the  combined  inﬂuence  of  sinuous  and  varicose  instability 
modes on the stability of a linearly viscoelastic sheet. Viscoelastic- 
ity was modeled by Oldroyd-B equation and the analysis modiﬁed 
the dispersion relations of Senecal et al. [321] . They conclude that 
a viscoelastic sheet is more unstable than a Newtonian sheet. Many 
parametric effects were also revealed in this study. 

5.10.2. Computations of sheet atomization 

Multi-dimensional computations of sheet atomization of non- 
Newtonian ﬂuids showing similar properties as gels have been re- 
ported in literature [ 41 , 224 , 303 ], along with specialized numerical 
models developed for the breakup of slurry jets [ 243 , 244 ], injec- 
tion processes in plain oriﬁce [324] , and secondary breakup in en- 
gines [325] . 

Chen  et  al.  [300]  developed  a  numerical  technique  for  eﬃ- 
ciently  and  accurately  tracking  the  liquid-gas  interface.  In  this 
technique,  the  level  set  and  volume  of  ﬂuid  (VoF)  methods  are 
combined with novel solution-adaptive mesh reﬁnement schemes. 
This technique was subsequently adopted for gels using impinging 
jets [ 41 , 224 , 303 ]. Ma et al. [41] found that the simulated breakup 
patterns of an HB gel are qualitatively similar to a Newtonian ﬂuid 
when  equivalent  Re  (based  on  HB  model)  and  We  are  used  for 
comparison. In at least one pattern, they found dissimilar behav- 
ior in that the droplets appear to peel of the sheet in case of gel 
instead of shedding from the rim.

of the sheet of an extended HB gel in the impact wave regime [224] , and (c) distribution of shear rate on the surface of sheet and ligaments for an extended HB gel [224] . 
Isosurface maps are adopted from the simulations of Yang and coworkers [ 41 , 224 ]. 

Fig. 111 a exhibits this dissimilar behavior in one view. Recently, 
Notaro  et  al.  [303]  used  simulations  of  HB  gel  to  conﬁrm  the 
experimental  observations  on  the  mixing  of  ﬂuids  in  impinging 
jet atomization. Improved predictions appeared in another study 
[224]  in  which,  the  extended  HB  model  was  used  on  the  ﬂow 
curves of ethanol-water-Carbopol-silica gel [ 39 , 81 , 223 , 263 ]. 

Chen and Yang [224] obtained additional data on the near-ﬁeld 
dynamics of sheets of an extended HB ﬂuid, showing that the ir- 
regularly  peeled  off ligaments  acquire  varied  shapes  in  the  im- 
l = 6195), as in 
pact wave regime at higher jet Weber number ( We 
Figs. 111 b and 111 c. These calculations also indicate that the thin- 
ner regions of ligaments (marked 1 and 2 in Fig. 111 c) are highly 
sheared. The maps of shear rate distribution in Fig. 111 c show the 
concentration of shear in the regions undergoing breakup as well 
as  in  the  core  of  the  ﬂapping  sheet  nearer  to  the  impingement 
point. However, the shear rate decreases to very low values in a 
rather short distance, possibly due to the limitation of rheological 
model employed in the simulations. 

Such  simulations  also  capture  the  nucleation  and  growth  of 
holes followed by the formation of web-like structures on the sur- 
face of an unstable sheet (see Fig. 111 a). Further, Strouhal number 
of the impact wave regimes was found nearly independent of We 
l 
l > 10 0 0) as the Newtonian sheets [300] . Ac- 
in the same region ( We 
cording to the authors, this result indicates that the wavelength of 
impact waves does not depend on the viscosity of gel. 

Direct numerical simulations of sheet dynamics using the con- 
servation equations of phasic ﬂow ﬁeld, capillary forces, and pha- 
sic interface have been applied for Carreau-Yasuda (CY) shear thin- 
ning  ﬂuids  [89] .  These  simulations  used  ﬁnite  element  method 
and an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework for interface 
resolution, along with implicit temporal tracking. Moreover, inter- 
facial transport of surface-active species was also solved using a 
convection-diffusion equation. A key focus of these investigations 

Fig. 112.  Effects of mass ﬂow rate pulsations on the dynamics of a CY ﬂuid sheet 
[89] . 

was  the  origin  of  interfacial  instabilities  that  trigger  the  impact 
waves on sheet surface. The impact waves originated as hydrody- 
namic instabilities near the stagnation point [89] . Unsteady injec- 
tion, typical of gel propellants, was also investigated as it triggers 
the ﬂow rate pulsations. Fig. 112 illustrates the effects of mass ﬂow 
pulsations on the dynamics of sheet surface. 

Apart from the usual responses to changes in frequency ( St ) and 
amplitude  ( A )  shown  in  Fig.  112 ,  a  striking  feature  of  instability 
propagation on the surface of a gel propellant sheet ( n = 0.6, 0.8) is 
that it is less stable than the Newtonian ﬂuid ( n = 1) due to shear 
thinning [89] . 

Another application of the VoF method is in the simulation of 
perturbed slurry jets by Schetz and coworkers [ 243 , 244 ]. We have 
discussed the breakup characteristics of the slurry jets handled by 
Ogg and Schetz [243] in Section 5.2.1 and Figs. 65c-65e . Such jets 
were then simulated. A key feature of their numerical model is the 
incorporation of phasic interaction terms in the governing equa- 
tions in the form of forces exerted by the particles on the liquid

in the behavior of crests and troughs widen as shown by the pre- 
dicted curves and experimental data, although the limitations of 
the model mentioned above result in increased deviations in the 
model  predictions.  However,  it  is  clear  that  the  model  correctly 
shows the decrease in growth rate for the slurry. Ogg and Schetz 
[243] also noted that the predictions could not capture the incip- 
ient growth and long-time behavior of the disturbance due to the 
lack of means to accurately model initial conditions.

account for the effects of particle size and mass loading. Situ and 
Schetz [244] found that the particle size and mass loading inﬂu- 
ence  the  breakup  of  slurry  jets.  Thus,  larger  particles  were  pre- 
dicted to stabilize the jet ( 3 and 4 ) and the higher mass loading 
was  predicted  to  destabilize  the  jet  ( 2  and  3 ).  When  compared 
with the liquid jet ( 1 ), the dilute slurry jet is more stable ( 3 ) and 
the dense slurry jet more unstable ( 2 ). 

A  key  particle-ﬂuid  and  particle-particle  interaction  is  mani- 
fested in the velocity difference between the particles and liquid. 
When the particle volume fraction increases at higher mass load- 
ing,  the  motion  of  clustered  particles  enhances  the  liquid  phase 
velocity,  increases  the  diameter  of  crest,  decreases  the  thickness 
of trough (neck), and leads to an early breakup to form a larger 
droplet. If the radial velocity of the particle clusters is smaller than 
that  of  the  liquid,  then  the  particles  preferentially  locate  them- 
selves in the core of the jet and away from the gas-liquid interface. 
These interactions are especially relevant for the breakup of slurry 
jets having higher mass loading of the solid particles. Also shown 
in Fig. 113 b is the non-monotonic variation of the dimensionless 
breakup time with mass loading. It is governed by the interactions 
discussed above. 

A  few  observations  on  the  non-dimensional  time  coordi- 
nate  are  relevant  here.  First,  it  should  be  noted  that  the

dimensionalization causes the curves for water and slurry to su- 
perimpose on each other ( t R = 2.36 ms and 2.47 ms for water and 
slurry, respectively) in Fig. 113 a. Second, as shown in Fig. 113 b, the 
breakup time is many times t R . Thus, a simple balance between the 
surface tension and inertia forces could not describe the breakup 
of jets in these experiments. Further, the dynamics of slurry jets is 
nonlinear in comparison to the liquid jet [ 243 , 244 ]. 

6. Combustion of gel propellants 

A  large  number  of  studies  on  different  aspects  of  the 
combustion  of  gel  propellants  have  appeared  in  the  literature 
[ 20 , 22-26 , 29 , 30 , 32–38 , 42 , 43 , 54–58 , 72 , 78 , 80 , 89–92 , 94–99 , 102 , 103 , 
106 , 109 , 112-116 , 118 , 121 , 123 , 137 , 145 , 152 , 213 , 220 , 227 , 257 , 325-379 ]. 
Combustion  of  gel  propellants  has  been  extensively  studied 
using  single  droplets  and  spray  ﬂames.  A  signiﬁcant  number 
of  these  studies  is  devoted  to  the  vaporization  and  combustion 
of  gel  droplets  [ 20 , 22-24 , 29 , 42 , 43 , 54 , 55 , 89 , 91 , 92 , 94–96 , 99 , 112 , 
118 , 145 , 326 , 334 , 336 , 337 , 344 , 349 , 350 , 353 , 357 , 366 , 367 , 378 , 379 ]. 
Nevertheless,  studies  focused  on  the  physics  of  droplet  combus- 
tion  process  and  its  impact  on  spray  ﬂames  are  still  relatively 
few;  the  main  emphasis  is  still  on  the  droplet  combustion  of 
different  liquid  fuel-gellant-additive  combinations.  A  spurt  in 
the  studies  on  the  ignition  of  gelled  hypergols  is  also  noted 
[ 35 , 38 , 57 , 58 , 90 , 97 , 98 , 213 , 227 , 343 , 346-348 , 353 , 362 , 363 ].  Relatively 
less attention has been given to the spray ﬂames of gel propel- 
lants  [ 25 , 56 , 351 , 357-360 , 376 ].  In  particular,  Padwal  and  Mishra

phase [243] , separate equations for the particle motion, and the 
treatment  of  particles  as  compressible  ﬂuid.  Transport  equations 
for particulate phase do not involve the pressure term and viscous 
term, the latter being because of the assumption that the parti- 
cles are uniformly sized and sparsely distributed in the liquid car- 
rier phase. These features constitute the picture of the slurry jet as 
the ﬂow of a dense phase in the surrounding ﬂuid of low density. 
Notably, relatively simple Newtonian low-viscosity assumption was 
made for the liquid phase (water). Further, the jet perturbation was 
in the form of an anti-symmetric (sinusoidal) wave, commensurate 
with the experimental observation (see Figs. 65c-65e ). The model 
was capable of predicting the evolution in the shape of the slurry 
jet surface and these predictions were compared with the experi- 
mentally obtained data on the amplitude of waves based on the vi- 
sualization of jet breakup. Illustrative results are given in Fig. 113 , 
in which, the instantaneous growth and contraction rates of the 
crests and troughs are tracked. 

In  Figs.  113 a  and  113 b,  the  initial  sharp  change  in  the  pre- 
dictions is a numerical artifact due to the pressure discontinuity 
[243] .  Predictions  of  the  model  are  also  constrained  by  the  im- 
posed symmetry boundary condition, which precludes the growth 
by non-axisymmetric modes. On this background, a comparison of 
the predictions and the experimental data for water ( d o = 0.7 mm, 
j = 3.3 m/s, We = 112, f = 1.2 kHz, St = 0.25) shown in Fig. 113 a in- 
u 
dicates that the dimensionless disturbance amplitudes ( b/d 
j ) grow 
exponentially. The model captures the magnitude and direction of 
the differences in the behavior of the crest and trough. With slurry

[56] performed comprehensive experiments on the bluff-body and 
swirl-stabilized  Jet  A1  gel  spray  ﬂames.  Apart  from  this  work, 
experiments  on  the  properties  of  spray  ﬂames  of  gel  fuels  are 
rarely reported and it is an area in need of urgent attention. On 
the other hand, signiﬁcant progress has already been achieved in 
the theoretical analysis of gel propellant spray ﬂames [ 25 , 351 , 357- 
360 , 376 ],  although  direct  comparisons  between  the  experiments 
and theoretical predictions have not been possible yet. 

The  studies  cited  above  also  include  the  ones  focused 
on  ramjet  combustion  of  metalized  gel  propellants,  espe- 
cially  those  concerned  with  the  experimental  rocket  en- 
gines 
[ 26 , 36 , 37 , 80 , 102 , 103 , 113–116 , 121 , 325 , 327 , 331 , 332 , 335 , 341 , 
356 , 364 , 371 ]. In this respect, the periodic status reports and sum- 
maries  [ 30 , 32 , 33 , 338–340 , 345 , 368–370 , 372–374 , 380 ]  addressing 
the speciﬁc issues encountered in the development of the German 
gel propulsion technology from its inception to the rocket ﬂights 
are also instructive. 

Also  relevant  to  us  are  some  studies  in  slurry  fuel  combus- 
tion  [ 64 , 66 , 232 , 329 , 381–399 ]  and  liquid  fuel  combustion  [400–
411] , which will be referred to during the discussion. 

It  is  now  commonly  agreed  that  the  addition  of  gellant  pro- 
foundly  affects  the  vaporization  and  combustion  dynamics  of  a 
droplet and thereby spray combustion processes, primarily through 
the transient changes in the properties of droplet surface and heat 
of vaporization, and hence, by inﬂuencing the heat balance. An- 
other difference with the liquid droplets is the residual shell (hol- 
low  and  rigid)  diameter  due  to  the  presence  of  gellant  residue. 
However, as borne out by the experimental results, the gel droplets 
also obey the d 2 -law of droplet combustion in a restricted sense. It 
should be noted that the relatively large size of droplets ( ∼10 2 - 
10 3 μm) in comparison to the droplets found in spray combustion 
( < 10 2 μm) usually does not introduce appreciable size effects be- 
cause the sizes considered in droplet combustion experiments also 
combust under the diffusion-controlled conditions. 

Since gel propellants include combustion of base liquid propel- 
lants, knowledge of the ignition and combustion of liquid propel- 
lants is a useful starting point for investigations on the gel pro- 
pellants.  A  vast  amount  of  literature  is  available  for  base  liquid 
hypergolic as well as non-hypergolic propellants; for example Ref. 
[ 99 , 412 , 413 ] on hypergols and Refs. [ 414 , 415 ] on other liquid pro- 
pellants, as well as references therein. 

In the following, we review the studies on gel propellant com- 
bustion in sequence, beginning with the vaporization and combus- 
tion of slurry fuel droplets, to be followed by gel fuel droplets and 
hypergolic gel droplets. Subsequently, we consider the spray com- 
bustion of gel propellants. The technological issues are considered 
in the end. 

6.1. Slurry fuel droplet 

Slurry fuels are mainly used in the liquid-ﬁred furnaces in the 
form of coal-water and coal-oil slurries. Moreover, their use has 
also been considered for ramjet combustion in the form of Al, B, 
C, and Mg slurries (using primarily JP class jet fuels) as mentioned 
above. Detailed reviews on the slurry fuels have appeared in the 
past [ 393 , 394 ]. Combustion of slurry fuel droplets is of fundamen- 
tal importance to the gel propellant combustion due to the many 
similarities  in  the  behavior  of  slurry  fuels  and  gel  propellants. 
Therefore, we discuss the essential features of slurry fuel droplet 
combustion  primarily, with the  help of  experiments reported by 
Lee and Law [388] . 

JP-10-carbon  black  slurry  fuel  (mean  particle  size  0.3  μm, 
Y s = 56 % max.) stabilized with surfactants and other additives (3-4 
%) was formed into droplets of initial size 20 0-40 0 μm using an 
inkjet printer [388] . The free-falling droplets were exposed to am- 
bient air at 1100 K. Phenomenological description of the droplet

ferent slurry loadings. Data and micrographs are adopted from Ref. [388] . 

combustion was constructed using the observations of combusting 
droplets. As the falling droplets combust after ignition, the ﬂame 
streak behind the droplet wrinkles with distortion in the droplet 
shape and general disruption. Effective diameter of the distorted 
droplets does not vary with time, indicating that a rigid shell has 
formed. The combustion is abruptly terminated by microexplosion 
and  fragmentation.  Visual  observations  and  the  deduced  droplet 
diameters clearly indicate that the slurry droplet combustion is di- 
vided into a shrinking droplet regime, constant diameter regime, 
and microexplosion, in that sequence [388] . These features are de- 
picted in Fig. 114 in terms of the droplet diameter traces and rep- 
resentative micrographs of the fragmented shells. 

As  shown  in  the  ﬁgure,  the  d 2 -law  of  droplet  combustion, 
which is valid over the entire combustion time, t C  for JP-10, ( ●), 
is obeyed for slurry droplets in the shrinking droplet regime only 
with low loadings ( Y s,max  ∼0.1). This regime is short-lived as the 
slurry  loading  increases,  and  it  is  quickly  followed  by  the  con- 
stant diameter regime. It is noted here that the microexplosion of 
droplets occurs quickly for the highly loaded slurries. 

As shown in the micrographs in the inset of Fig. 114 , the result- 
ing shells are rigid and thin walled [388] . They exhibit relatively 
smooth exterior surface disrupted by cracks and holes created after 
microexplosion. Shell walls are porous (porosity, εp → 0.476) and 
composed of smaller carbon particles [388] . The pores are ﬁlled 
by liquid JP-10 at the time of shell formation [388] . During com- 
bustion, the remaining slurry and a fuel vapor bubble in the core 
occupy the hollow portion of shells. 

Lee and Law [388] also formulated a mathematical model for 
estimating the temporal variations in the sizes of the slurry and 
vapor layers in the constant diameter regime and found that they 
varied with time following the ’ d 3 -law’. The model also incorpo- 
rates conditions necessary to explain the transition between the 
d 2 - and d 3 - laws in terms of the shell properties. The inﬂuence of 
surfactants and stabilizers used for enhancing the storage life of 
slurries in terms of droplet swelling and shape distortion was also 
surmised. 

We now summarize the main ﬁndings of selected studies on 
slurry  droplet  combustion.  A  previous  report  of  Szekely  Jr  and 
Faeth [384] on the JP-10-55.4 % carbon black (particle size 0.3 μm) 
slurry  fuel  used  40 0-10 0 0 μm  tethered  droplets  in  a  hot  ambi- 
ent  environment  created  by  a  turbulent  diffusion  ﬂame.  Szekely 
Jr and Faeth found that the agglomerate of carbon particles con- 
sumed 90-95 % of the droplet combustion time. Mueller and Turns 
[385] studied the shell characteristics and their effects on the sec- 
ondary atomization of burning Al-RP-1 droplets initially in the 20- 
100 μm size range by using experiments and theoretical analysis 
based  in  part  on  the  model  of  Lee  and  Law  [388] .  Their  analy- 
sis predicted the minimum diameter of droplet required for dis-

ruption. Droplet combustion phenomenology and modeling based 
on the properties of nano and micro particles of Al in n-decane 
and ethanol based tethered slurry droplets were reported by Gan 
and Qiao [387] . The slurries containing 10 % metal particles were 
stabilized  by  2.5  %  sorbitan  oleate.  Particle  characteristics  were 
shown to affect the microexplosion of slurry droplets. Wong and 
Lin [389] considered the effect of surfactant on the nature of mi- 
croexplosion in case of Al-JP-10-carbon slurry droplets with par- 
ticle  loading  as  high  as  60  %.  Sirignano  and  Bhatia  [390]  com- 
piled the results of an extensive analytical and numerical modeling 
study on n-octane-Al droplet and spray combustion. The isolated 
droplet  vaporization  model  was  developed  for  use  in  the  spray 
combustion calculations. Recently, Ghamari and Ratner [396] per- 
formed tethered droplet combustion experiments using up to 3 wt 
% carbon nano particles, platelets, and tubes in Jet A fuel. These 
droplets  followed  the  d 2 -law  and  several  events  of  swelling  and 
jetting (’puﬃng’ [396] ) were observed. The droplet combustion rate 
was found to have improved when particles were added by up to 
10 % over pure Jet A fuel droplet. Guerieri et al. [397] also reported 
on the effects of relatively small concentration of Al or nitrocellu- 
lose nanoparticles on the droplet combustion rate in terms of their 
tendency to agglomerate in kerosene droplets formed from stabi- 
lized suspensions. 

6.2. Vaporization of gel propellant 

A carefully optimized gel propellant formulation using an or- 
ganic  gellant  could  have  caloriﬁc  value  very  similar  to  the  base 
liquid propellant. However, the presence of gellant also affects the 
vaporization of the gel propellant through alteration in the value 
of enthalpy of vaporization. In the case of droplet combustion, the 
enthalpy of vaporization determines the combustion time ( t C ) of 
droplet. Enthalpy of vaporization ( (cid:4)H vap ) is also signiﬁcant in the 
exchange of heat during vaporization and combustion of droplets. 
Hence, we discuss the effect of gellants on the vaporization of gel 
propellants with the help of results of two investigations [ 20 , 72 ], 
as summarized in Fig. 115 . 

Nachmoni and Natan [20] found that the gellant would signif- 
icantly increase the enthalpy of vaporization ( (cid:4)H vap ) by as much 
as 1.8 times over that of the base liquid propellant, as shown in 
Fig. 115 a. While precise causes of the observed trends were not ex- 
plored, it is suggested that they could be explained by variations in 
the heat of gelation induced by Y G [20] . The variability for a given 
gellant concentration ( Y G ) could be signiﬁcant due to the experi- 
mental uncertainty, especially at the highest Y G . 

Arnold et al. [72] employed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to probe the effects of 
inorganic Cabosil gellant on the JP-8 gel propellant. Trends in the 
mass ratio ( m / m 0 ) of the sample remained same irrespective of the 
gellant concentration and base propellant as well as gel propellant 
remained in the same 300-410 K temperature range of vaporiza- 
tion, as shown in Fig. 115 b. 

Curves  from  DSC  measurements  (heating  rate  ∼20  K/min) 
shown  in  Fig.  115 c  reveal  that  gels  and  the  base  propellant  ex- 
hibit similar behavior during vaporization prior to the endothermic 
peak. Heat ﬂow increased for the gels in the region of high tem- 
perature and the endothermic peak shifted towards right in com- 
parison to the peak of 375 K for JP-8, possibly due to the diﬃculty 
experienced by JP-8 migration into vapor phase due to the pres- 
ence of silica gellant network [72] . Temperature at the minimum 
heat ﬂow ( T 2 ) is higher for gels. While gellant concentration did 
not affect the heat ﬂow signiﬁcantly, even the minimum Y G = 5 % is 
seen to be suﬃcient to reduce the endothermic heat ﬂow, broaden 
the  vaporization  temperature  range,  and  reduce  (cid:4)H vap  [72] .  Ac- 
cording to the authors, reduction in the enthalpy of vaporization 
(see Table 5 and 6 in Ref. [72] for (cid:4)H vap  values estimated using 
DSC) is facilitated by an apparent shift of the JP-8 to a more free 
state in the presence of gellant. 

We  thus  observe  from  the  limited  available  data  that  the 
enthalpy  of  vaporization  of  gel  propellants  could  be  higher  or 
lower  than  the  base  liquid  propellant.  More  investigations  on 
the  probable  causes  behind  these  observations  and  effects  as- 
sociated  with  the  organic/inorganic  nature  of  the  gellant  are 
required.

droplet in which the gellant is an inorganic compound that in itself

6.3.1. Parametric effects 

Nachmoni and Natan [20] conducted droplet combustion exper- 
iments  using  silica-based  inorganic  gellant  and  JP-5.  The  gellant 
was mixed in 2-5 %. Experiments on the ignition and combustion 
of droplets supported on Pyrex wires were performed under the 
varying conditions of chamber pressure ( P C ) and oxygen mass frac- 
tion in the ambient air ( Y O ). Measurements including the droplet 
temperature, diameter, and heat of vaporization were carried out 
in the range P C = 0.1-2 MPa and Y O = 0.2-0.6 to draw comparison 
with the liquid propellants. Their data are compiled in Fig. 116 . 

Increasing the gellant concentration increased the droplet tem- 
perature ( T 
d ). The droplet temperature also increased at higher am- 
bient pressure for a ﬁxed gellant concentration. These results are 
shown in Fig. 116 a and suggest the increased saturation tempera- 
ture with pressure at subcritical conditions [20] . During its contact 
with  the  droplet  and  ﬂame,  the  thermocouple  records  the  tran- 
sition points 1-5 and the droplet temperature here is interpreted 
as  the  average  temperature  in  the  region  ( 3-4 )  according  to  the 
temperature history traced in Fig. 116 b. The miniature thermocou- 
ple (TC) was initially in contact with the droplet for part of the 
combustion process, as indicated. The transition points denote the 
stages of droplet heat-up ( 1-2 ), ignition ( 2 ), post-ignition heat-up 
( 2-3 ), combustion at constant temperature ( 3-4 ), and ﬂame extinc- 
tion ( 5 ). The region ( 4-5 ) covers the duration of contact with ﬂame 
as droplet regressed enough to expose the thermocouple tip to hot 
gases produced by the ﬂame. 

Fig. 116 c compares the experimental data for different gellant 
concentrations.  Increased  combustion  time  resulted  from  higher 

In Eq. (38) , D O  is the diffusivity of O 

2  and B T  is the Spalding 
number. Only the experimental data for Y G = 2 % reasonably fol- 
lowed the predictions of Eq. (38) . The scatter in data are somewhat 
large for some cases; however, the overall trends suggest that the 
inorganic gel droplet combustion followed the d 2 -law predictions 
within the limits of experimental uncertainty. The effect of gellant 
concentration enters the description of d 2 -law in terms of the la- 
tent heat of vaporization ( (cid:2)H vap ), which increased by 1.75 times 
for Y G = 5 %. The combustion rate itself was found to decrease for 
increased Y G and increase for higher P C . 

6.3.2. Combustion regimes 

The  phenomenology  of  vaporization  and  combustion  of  a 
droplet  gelled  by  an  inorganic  gellant  is  illustrated  using  the 
photographic  study  and  measurements  of  Arnold  and  Anderson 
[22] for the JP-8-4 % Cabosil gel system as shown in Fig. 117 . 

It shows the band of droplet temperatures for the gel propel- 
lant in comparison to JP-8 liquid fuel. In between the ignition ( 0 ) 
and extinction ( 4 ) events, three distinct events could be identiﬁed, 
among which the initial droplet heating and incipient vaporization 
( 1-1 and 1 (cid:2) -1 (cid:2) ) is common to both the ﬂuids. It is followed by com- 
bustion, which occurs at a constant rate for JP-8 ( 2-2 ) and with 
increasing rate for JP-8-Cabosil gel ( 2 (cid:2) -2 (cid:2) ) . Silica shell also forms 
during this event for the gel propellant. Subsequently, both kinds 
of droplets experience a period of sudden temperature rise after 
combustion ( 3-3 and 3 (cid:2) -3 (cid:2) ). In case of JP-8, it is attributed to the 
contact of ﬂame with thermocouple [22] , similar to the observa- 
tions made previously in relation to Fig. 116 b [20] . In case of JP-8

adopted from Ref. [22] . 

inorganic gel, the temperature rise could be due to the heating and 
combustion of JP-8 fuel trapped within the silica shell [22] . 

As shown in the inset of Fig. 117 , the shell formation event is 
a transient process characterized by a partial rupture of the shell 
and appearance of random cracks on its surface. Shell formation 
itself is triggered by the vaporization and combustion of JP-8 fuel 
from the surface of gel droplet at the onset of the combustion. Fuel 
vapors trapped inside the shell are released as jets and burn in 
a secondary ﬂame, as shown in the time-sequence of the images. 
The fuel vapor jetting and combustion lasted for approx. 24 ms in 
the sequence shown in Fig. 117 . Such events could repeat randomly 
during the lifetime of the droplet. However, catastrophic microex- 
plosion observed in case of slurry droplets [388] was absent. 

Fig.  118  compiles  the  variations  in  the  dimensionless  droplet 
diameter ( d 
d ) during its vaporization and combustion and reveals 
the additional quantitative differences between the gelled and non- 
gelled  liquid  fuels.  The  initial  transient  in  droplet  diameter  is 
shorter  for  JP-8-Cabosil  ( (cid:2))  in  comparison  to  JP-8  ( ◦)  (also  ob- 
served in the temperature traces of Fig. 117 ). The ﬁnal droplet di- 
ameter does not drop to zero for the gel because an inorganic gel- 
lant does not burn along with the fuel. While it increased slightly 
in this case, this behavior depends upon the structural integrity of 
the gellant shell and gellant concentration. Fig. 118 a clearly shows 
that  the  d 2 -law  is  obeyed  by  the  gel  droplet  within  the  regions 
bounded  by  initial  transient  and  ﬁnal  adjustments  in  the  shell 
diameter. The effective combustion rate constant ( K’ ), deﬁned as 
the  negative  of  the  slope  of  the  experimental  data  as  shown  in 
Fig. 118 a, is also somewhat smaller for the gel droplet in compari- 
son to the JP-8 droplet. 

The effective rate constant ( K’ ) is the local slope of the curve 
d,0 ) 2 -( t/t C ) and its variation with the droplet lifetime is also 
( d 
d /d 
shown in Fig. 118 a. Sustained combustion to extinction of the JP-8 
droplet is reﬂected in the variations of K’ , which nearly steadies to- 
wards the end of combustion. It decreases dramatically as the d 2 - 
law regime is taken over by the constant diameter regime in the 
case of JP-8-Cabosil gel droplet. The effective rate constant is itself 
a function of the gellant concentration ( Y G ) as shown in Fig. 118 b 
in which, it is expressed as the time-average ( K’ avg ) of instanta- 
neous  K’ .  The  combustion  of  droplet  slows  down  as  the  gellant 
concentration is increased. 

Recently,  Cao  et  al.  [416]  reported  enhanced  combustion  sta- 
bility  with  silica  in  kerosene  when  compared  with  an  organic 
gellant,  along  with  the  reduced  ignition  delay  and  droplet  life-

latter stages enhanced perhaps due to the higher thermal conduc- 
tivity of silica and capillary action in the porous shell [416] . 

6.4. Organic gel droplet 

6.4.1. Phenomenological description of vaporization and combustion 

Phenomenological description of the vaporization and combus- 
tion of organic gel droplet is based on the experimental observa- 
tions  reported  by  Natan  and  coworkers  [ 23 , 24 ].  The  description 
could  be  understood  with  the  help  of  Fig.  119 .  These  observa- 
tions have been conﬁrmed for many different gel propellant sys- 
tems  (both  hypergolic  and  non-hypergolic)  involving  the  organic 
gellants. The data for non-hypergolic gel droplets are summarized 
in Table 21 . 

Table 21 shows three studies [ 43 , 96 , 148 ] in which, MMH and 
UDMH fuels of the hydrazine class (typically used for hypergolic 
gel propellants to be discussed in Sections 6.6 and 6.7 ) have been 
studied  in  the  presence  of  O 
2  oxidizer.  Droplets  of  such  non- 
hypergolic  combinations  were  ignited  using  autoignition  or  heat 
supplied by an external ﬂame. We will discuss these cases sepa- 
rately in Section 6.4.3 . 

The ﬁrst distinguishing feature of the organic gel droplet com- 
bustion is the ability of the gellant to vaporize and combust. Nat- 
urally, it would depend on the melting and boiling points of the 
gellant and the gellant could be the last species to vaporize and 
combust. The rheological behavior of organic gellant (elasticity is 
the most easily recognized property here) also affects the droplet 
combustion, unlike the rigid shell of gellant formed by inorganic 
gellants and some solid components of slurry fuel droplets. Due to

these features, the combustion of organic gel droplet is only su- 
perﬁcially similar to the inorganic gel and slurry fuel droplets, in- 
cluding occasional explosion event [23] . We now discuss these fea- 
tures with the help of experimental studies cited in Table 21 and 
Fig. 119 separately for non-polymeric and polymeric organic gel- 
lants. 

Droplet heating alters the liquid-gellant network in terms of the 
realignment  of  network  and  migration  of  gellant  particles  along 
the  surface  of  droplet.  The  eventual  formation  of  a  viscous  (no 
doubt  rheologically  complex)  layer  comprising  of  liquid  (solvent 
or other component) and gellant on the surface leads to a pref- 
erential  accumulation  of  liquid  of  low  boiling  point  on  the  sur- 
face while the internally trapped multi-component mixture of liq- 
uids contains the remaining higher-boiling fractions. Vaporization 
of  the  liquid  on  the  surface  establishes  the  ﬂame  shown  for  a 
particular case [24] in the top-right corner of Fig. 119 . The core 
of droplet is turbulent [ 23 , 24 ] and is characterized by the nucle- 
ation  of  vapor  bubbles,  their  migration,  and  expansion.  The  ex- 
panding bubbles push against the gellant layer, while simultane- 
ously interacting with each other. Bubble expansion also induces a 
multi-dimensional stress ﬁeld in the gellant layer to which, it re- 
sponds by stretching and thinning. Thus, rheological complexity of 
the layer might trigger changes in its ﬂow behavior. The result is 
manifested as droplet swelling and weakening of the gellant layer 
at random locations along the surface. Eventually, hole(s) nucleate 
from these weakened regions and a fuel vapor jet is ejected. Sud- 
den increase in the fuel vapor mass fraction leads to ﬂuctuations 
in the rate of combustion and hence, in the heat released during 
combustion. Ejection of the excess fuel vapors causes the gellant 
layer to shrink, reform, and again swell in response to the expand- 
ing bubbles. Certain degree of repetitive ejection of fuel vapor jets 
is thus likely. Latter reports on the droplets of Jet A1-Thixatrol ST- 
xylene gel propellant [ 54 , 112 ] also veriﬁed the occurrence of these 
events. These studies found an early onset of fuel vapor ejection 
events (’jetting’), followed by a relatively steady droplet combus- 
tion  in  comparison  to  the  similar  gel  propellant  system  [ 23 , 24 ]. 
Differences in the porosity of the gellant layer could have intro- 
duced these variations. 

Abundance  of  interacting  bubbles  in  the  interior  means  that 
multiple  hole  nucleation  events  might  also  be  possible  in  some 
cases.  Similar  to  the  properties  of  shells  playing  important  role 
in  the  dynamics  of  combustion  of  a  slurry  fuel  droplet,  the  dy- 
namic rheological properties of the gellant layer are expected to 
govern  the  response  of  gel  droplet  to  the  ejection  of  fuel  vapor 
jet(s). These transient conditions lead to the ’oscillatory combus- 
tion’  [334]  of  organic  gel  droplets,  and  thereby,  of  their  spray 
ﬂames [25] . 

The  main  stages  of  the  combustion  of  organic  gel  droplet  as 
described above induce ﬂuctuations in the volume of a combust- 
ing droplet and temperature as shown in Fig. 120 . The tempera- 
ture ﬂuctuations are similar to a droplet composed of an inorganic 
gellant as discussed previously with reference to Fig. 117 . Hypo- 
thetical variations shown in the inset of Fig. 120 indicate a gradual 
shell ) prior to the onset of 
rise in the thickness of gellant layer ( h 
vapor ejection. Spikes in the time-trace of h 
shell would occur as a 
consequence of the repetitive vapor ejection, shrinkage, reforma- 
tion, and swelling. These transients are especially frequent in the 
later stages of droplet combustion, as shown by the time-trace of 
dimensionless instantaneous droplet volume ( V t /V 0 ) in Fig. 120 . 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  droplets  used  in  the  studies  re- 
ported  so  far  are  not  in  the  same  rheological  state  as  that  of  a 
droplet in spray as the tethered droplets are simply deposited on 
the  holder  and  typically  sheared  at  relatively  very  low  levels  of 
shear. This important distinction should be recognized while ap- 
plying  the  rheological  models  to  the  droplet  combustion,  in  ad- 
dition to the thermal effects on the rheological properties of the

gellant layer. Droplets in the spray are formed from already highly 
sheared gel propellant. 

Nevertheless, the rheology of gel propellants is also expressed 
at the droplet combustion level in all experiments. In this regard, 
we consider two recent reports [ 336 , 379 ] on the combustion of or- 
ganic gel droplets using polymeric gellants to illustrate the rheo- 
logical effects. The relevant data of these studies are summarized 
in Table 21 . Results of the experiments performed by Ghamari and 
Ratner [379] are compiled in Figs. 121 and 122 . 

Phenomenological features of droplet vaporization and combus- 
tion  in  the  presence  of  polymeric  gellant  shown  in  Fig.  121  are 
similar  to  other  cases  discussed  so  far.  Thus,  we  observe  nucle- 
ation and growth of the bubble of fuel vapors, leading to the rup- 
ture of droplet surface and ejection of fuel vapors in Fig. 121 a. The 
end-stage of the droplet is however very different from previously 
considered cases and we notice the dynamic rheological effects in- 
troduced by elasticity of the polymer macromolecules leading to 
the threads attached to the surface of droplet as in Figs. 121 b and 
121 c. 

A  mechanism  for  the  ejection  of  vapor  jets  proposed  by 
Ghamari and Ratner [379] is also shown in Fig. 121 . Viscoelastic 
effects have been noted as the predominant rheological property 
towards  the  end  of  droplet  combustion.  It  should  also  be  noted 
that the rupture sites are randomly distributed along the droplet 
surface and multiple rupture events could thus be expected. High- 
speed visualization of the combustion processes enabled the au- 
thors to identify different regimes (numbered 1-4 in Fig. 122 a) dur- 
ing the lifetime of droplet. 

Among them, the regimes ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) conﬁrm to the expected 
linear trend when the d 2 -law is obeyed. Vapor ejection events oc- 
curred in the regime ( 2 ) (also shown bracketed). Regime ( 4 ) in- 
volves the combustion of polybutadiene (PB) because the surface 
temperature was higher than the boiling point of fuel [379] . 

Ghamari  and  Ratner  proceeded  to  estimate  the  rate  constant 
( K ) for the regimes 1 and 3 and obtained the trends in K values 
and the combustion time ( t C ) for different gellant concentrations as 
shown in Fig. 122 b. Vapor ejection was not violent except for high 
gellant concentrations, with the appearance of threads as shown 
in Figs. 121 b and 121 c. Overall combustion time is a strong func- 
tion of the gellant concentration ( Y G ) and decreased signiﬁcantly at 
higher Y G , largely due to the enhanced combustion in regime ( 4 ). 
This would also account for the increased rate constant for regime 
( 3 ). Regime ( 1 ) is not signiﬁcantly affected by the increase in Y G . 
Ghamari and Ratner [379] also noted that the gel fuel combustion 
was generally slower than the corresponding nongelled fuels pri- 
marily because of the lower combustion rates in regimes ( 1 ) and 
( 3 ). They attributed this to the increased viscosity of the fuel and

Miglani et al. [336] shed more light on the nature of dynamic 
rheological effects manifested in the response of droplet to an ejec- 
tion of the fuel vapors. They suggested that the strain response of 
ethanol-HPMC gels to the applied stress on either side of the nom- 
inal yield point extracted at normal conditions could be used to 
infer that a ﬂexible and weak shell forms for low Y G as compared 
to a rigid and strong shell for high Y G . Thus, hole nucleation and 
ejection of the fuel vapors following a swelling in the droplet vol- 
ume is expected to occur frequently for an ethanol droplet gelled 
with smaller concentration of HPMC. 

It is clear that many factors, including the droplet size, compo- 
sition of the propellant, and ambient conditions govern the oscil- 
latory vaporization and combustion of gel propellant droplets. Re- 
garding the ambient conditions, it is known that a high ambient 
temperature is required for the oscillatory vaporization and ejec- 
tion of fuel vapors to set in. It is possible that heat transfer to the 
droplet increases to a level that allows suﬃcient vaporization of 
the liquid component of higher boiling point to commence once 
the  resistance  offered  by  the  solid  phase  to  the  heat  transfer  is 
overcome.  In  any  case,  the  viscoelasticity  of  gellant  layer  is  im- 
portant  because  swelling  and  surface  stretching  of  a  viscoelastic 
droplet probably allows more of the heavier liquid to boil off and 
accumulate in the vapor space.

diminished diffusion to the surface. The differences in the behav- 
ior of Jet A and diesel gel fuels are probably due to the different 
surface tension and viscosity characteristics of the base fuels [379] .

Jet  A1-Thixtarol  ST-xylene  gel  propellant  for  which  d

early onset of the events leading to fuel vapor ejection and sig- 
niﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the droplet diameter. These events always 
led to the vaporization and combustion region properly described 
by  the  d 2 -law.  In  comparison,  the  data  of  Ghamari  and  Ratner 
[379] show that the events leading to the ejection of fuel vapors 
(highlighted regions in Fig. 123 ) are preceded by a regime appro-

bubbles with thin shells towards the end of combustion, as shown 
in Fig. 124 . 

Oscillatory vaporization and combustion of the gel droplets has 
attracted  attention  [43]  in  the  form  of  high-speed  visualization 
in two-dimensions by the PLIF imaging of the OH radical formed 
during  the  combustion  of  MMH-HPC  droplet.  Fig.  125 a  shows  a 
jetting event. Subsequent to jetting, three distinct conditions, dif- 
ferentiated  by  the  speed  of  ejecting  jet,  have  been  recorded.  At 
the low ejection speed, jet of fuel vapor escaping from the inner 
core of droplet merely distorts the ﬂame surrounding the droplet 
( Fig. 125 b). At the medium speed, jet could break the ﬂame front 
before dissipating in the surrounding environment ( Fig. 125 c). At 
the high speed, the jet disrupted the ﬂame and formed its own 
’ﬁreball’ as shown in Fig. 125 d. 

The  jet  speed  ( ∼0.1-3  m/s)  depends  on  gellant  concentration 
and ambient pressure; such that higher gellant concentrations in- 
creased  the  jet  speed  and  higher  ambient  pressure  reduced  the 
speed.  It  should  be  noted  that  isolated  droplets  burn  in  the 
diffusion-controlled regime, irrespective of size, and both the sub- 
millimeter  and  millimeter  scale  droplets  show  jetting  [ 24 , 43 , 55 ]. 
Although  not  shown  for  MMH-3  %  HPC  gel  droplet,  ﬁreball  has 
been observed for 3 % HPC gel of methanol [326] as well. 

Liu et al. [96] extracted the diameter histories of freely falling 
UDMH droplets gelled with 3 % HPC under the inﬂuence of dif- 
ferent chamber pressures ( P C ) and O 
2 ) for the 
millimeter-scale droplets and then compared the estimated com- 
bustion rate constants ( K

selt number as estimated using Eq. (39c) . The resulting data are 
compiled in Fig. 126 . 

Fig. 126 a shows that the higher P C supports relatively smoother 
combustion by suppressing the oscillations, with delayed swelling 
and jetting events as indicated by the peaks, presumably due to 
an increase in the boiling temperature, longer heating of UDMH 
droplet, and suppression of perturbations generated by the move- 
ment of bubbles within the gellant layer [96] . Slower jets at higher 
P C  ( Fig.  125 )  reduce  ﬂuctuations.  Similar  trends  were  observed 
when X O 
2 decreased as shown in Fig. 126 b due to the lower ﬂame 
temperature and delayed heating, both of which should consider- 
ably affect bubble nucleation, expansion, and jetting. As shown in 
Fig. 126 c, increase in the rate constant ( K 
2 is

2 near the droplet surface 
explained by a higher concentration of O 
that causes the ﬂame to locate closer towards the droplet surface 
and intensiﬁes the heat transfer [96] . It should be noted that the 
predictions of Eq. (39) are to be viewed only as qualitative since

combinations  involving  non-polymeric  [ 54 , 112 ]  and  polymeric  organic  gellants

priately modeled by the d 2 -law and followed by another regime 
where  the  d 2 -law  holds  (see  also  Fig.  122 a  and  the  description 
in Section 6.4.1 ). Thus, the overall behavior of the gel propellant 
droplets is fundamentally altered by the structure of gellant (par- 
ticulate  or  polymeric)  and  elasticity  of  gellant  layer.  The  gellant 
type  (polymeric  or  non-polymeric)  useful  for  spray  combustion 
must be determined from atomization studies. 

We have already considered some parametric effects involving 
the  gellant  concentration,  type  of  base  fuel,  and  type  of  gellant 
in Section 6.4.1 . Other parametric effects involving the convective 
heat transfer effects due to the ﬂowing ambient ﬂuid, temperature, 
pressure, and composition of the ambient conditions need to be 
studied. 

Cho et al. [326] described the advantages of 3D hydroxyl-planar 
laser induced ﬂuorescence (OH-PLIF) imaging of gel droplet com- 
bustion  by  a  comparison  with  their  previous  2D  OH-PLIF  data 
for  the  MMH-HPC  gel,  discussed  separately  in  connection  with 
Fig. 125 . 

6.4.3. Combustion of UDMH and MMH gel droplets 

Arnold et al. [148] measured the temperature histories of teth- 
ered MMH-4 % HPC droplets suspended in ambient air and found 
that the curve previously shown in Fig. 120 is also observed for the 
MMH droplet and that the combustion of MMH gel is distinguished 
from MMH in the latter portion of the temperature trace. This re- 
gion is of  pronounced rise in temperature as  the ﬂame touched 
thermocouple [148] . It also marks the end of swelling and jetting 
events. 

As shown in Fig. 124 , these events are facilitated by the post- 
ignition  eruption  of  bubbles.  They  coalesce  as  combustion  con- 
tinues  and  this  period  is  accompanied  by  swelling  and  jetting, 
known  to  occur  for  organic  gellants.  Coalescence  leads  to  larger

considered. With reference to Fig. 127 a, two stages are included 
in the mathematical description; ﬁrst involving the consumption 
of hydrocarbon fuel ( 1 ) and formation of the gellant layer on the 
surface of droplet ( 3 ), and second covering the effects of bubble 
formation ( 4 ) to the rupture of gellant layer ( 3 ). 

Under the assumptions of spherical symmetry, binary core, and 
constant radius of the droplet [24] , model equation for the concen- 
f ) in the r-t coordinate space is governed by 
tration of liquid fuel ( C 
the diffusion coeﬃcient of fuel. It needs to be solved for the stage 
I. Values of C 
f at the surface depend upon the heat ﬂux from the 
ﬂame side received at the droplet surface and can be obtained us- 
ing the proposals of King [417] , or with the help of appropriate 
heat balance [ 334 , 344 ]. The gellant layer thickness in the second 
stage is estimated by Eq. (40) using the volumes occupied by the 
individual phases.

r 
d  is  gel  droplet  radius  and  r tot  is  the  total  gel  droplet  radius 
in  stage  II.  Rupture  of  the  gellant  layer  is  considered  to  occur 
at  the  instant  the  time-dependent  tensile  stress  σ ( t )  given  by 
Eq. (41) equals the ’rupture stress’, currently considered equal to 
the yield stress. The assigned magnitude of yield stress is arbitrary. 
In Eq. (41) , p is the pressure.

The  model  predicts  that  the  ﬁrst  stage  is  signiﬁcantly  longer 
than the second stage, as seen from the data compiled in Fig. 128 . 
The thickness of gellant layer ( h G ) depends on the initial droplet 
diameter ( d 
d,0 ). Since the smaller droplets withstand higher pres- 
sure  difference,  the  ﬁnal  gellant  layer  is  thinner,  as  seen  from 
Fig. 128 . 

Kunin et al. [344] presented the effects of vaporization rate ex- 
pressed in terms of the vaporization parameter ( E vap ’ ), viscosity of 
the  gellant  and  fuel  ( ηG / η
f ),  and  the  rate  of  bubble  growth  ex- 
b , using the model described above for 
pressed as rate constant C 
stage I and II of gel droplet shown in Fig. 127 a. Their predictions 
are complied in Fig. 129 . 

Accordingly,  higher  E vap ’  thickens  the  gellant  layer  faster 
( Fig. 129 a). A highly viscous combination of the gellant and fuel 
will suppress the growth of the gellant layer as shown in Fig. 129 b 
since it will reduce the diffusivity of liquid fuel. It is noted here 
that D ∝ η−1 
mix as given by the Wilke-Chang correlation [ 334 , 344 ]. In 
this model, the bubble growth in stage II (see Fig. 127 a) is mod-

eled as linear in t and expressed by the rate constant C 
from Fig. 129 c, the gellant layer thickness is very sensitive to C

assumptions. 

6.4.4. Mathematical modeling of droplet vaporization and combustion 
Currently  available  mathematical  models  for  the  vaporization 
and combustion of gel droplets are limited to the droplets based 
on  organic  gellants  [ 334 , 344 , 367 ].  Unlike  the  approach  followed 
in  the  case  of  hypergolic  gel  droplets  discussed  subsequently  in 
Section 6.7.2 , the models for non-hypergolic gel droplets tend to 
focus on the heat transfer processes. These ’droplet-side’ models 
have not been integrated with the ’spray-side’ models. We discuss 
different models in Sections 6.5.2 , 6.8.2 , 6.8.5 , and 6.8.6 for the or- 
ganic gel spray ﬂames. The droplet combustion models are based 
on the physical description of vaporization and combustion as ev- 
idenced by the visualizations of the gel droplets and sketched in 
Fig. 127. A recurring theme of the models presented below in two 
different contexts is that of the gellant layer thickness ( h G ). Typi- 
cally, the entire process is divided into two or three steps segre- 
gating the crucial events such as formation and rupture of gellant 
layer  [ 334 , 344 , 358 , 367 ]  and  ejection  of  metal  particles  from  the 
surface of droplet [367] . As such, the model equations aim to cap- 
ture essentially time-dependent features of the processes. In the 
following,  we  provide  only  the  equations  most  essential  for  the 
discussion and omit the rest in the interest of brevity. Relevant ref- 
erences should be consulted for the complete governing equations, 
boundary conditions, and solution methods. 

Kunin et al. [ 334 , 344 ] presented the ﬁrst model for describing 
the vaporization of gel droplets composed of a hydrocarbon fuel 
and organic gellants based on the observations of a previous ex- 
perimental program [ 20 , 24 ] and since replicated in many studies 
as described in the present section (see Table 21 for a brief sum- 
mary). Their model does not treat the mechanism of oscillatory va- 
porization and combustion, as the underlying mechanisms are still 
not known in required detail. Instead, the effects of initial droplet 
radius on the formation of gellant layer and ejection of fuel jet are

of the gellant layer, while a drastic thinning is observed for C 
It turns out that this is caused by a rapid rise in the tensile stress 
when the bubble expands at a high rate, as expected. 

Hadad and Natan [419] further examined the vaporization of or- 
ganic gel droplet using similar analysis method as described in the 
preceding paragraphs. Small droplets 50-100 μm in size (the size 
range actually found in spray combustion) and enforced spherical 
symmetry were included in the analysis. The droplet was modeled 
as a two-component mixture of gellant and fuel and heating, va- 
porization and diffusion, bubble and gellant layer expansion were 
included  with  appropriate  interface  conditions.  According  to  the 
parametric analysis, concentration of gellant on the surface, initial 
thickness, surface tension, and rupture stress are important during 
the oscillatory stage. 

Solomon et al. [418] demonstrated the feasibility of ﬁrst trap- 
ping  B  in  the  gel  fuel  droplets  and  then  using  its  timed  ejec- 
tion  from  the  surface  of  dry  layer  with  the  help  of  a  pyrotech- 
nic. Speciﬁcally, ejection of the B particle clusters is timed to oc- 
cur during the period between the end of liquid fuel combustion 
and beginning of the metal/oxide liquefaction. Among the tested 
pyrotechnic materials, perchlorates of Na and K are shown to be 
suitable for clustering with B (B:Al:XClO 
4 , 71.5:14.25:14.25 compo- 
sition, X ≡NH 
4 /Na/K) and their application led to the formation of a 
dry layer by virtue of the higher activation temperature [ 367 , 418 ]. 
The  resulting  micron-scale  clusters  ( ∼100 μm)  could  be  ejected 
and dispersed in the hot medium like droplets (subject to appro- 
priate P C ). 

The  physical  process  is  sketched  in  Fig.  127 b,  along  with  vi- 
sualization  of  boron  ejection  event.  Solomon  et  al.  [367]  used 
the  physical  model  based  on  these  experimental  visualizations 
[418] ( Fig. 127 b) and extended the two-step shrinking core model 
of Tran and Mathur [420] with the addition of a B particle (radi- 
ally outward) ejection step. This stage commences once the sur- 
face temperature reaches the pyrotechnic activation temperature. 

Subsequent pyrotechnic reactions could help in triggering the ig- 
nition of B. It is noted here that the shrinking core model already 
describes the ﬁrst two steps shown in Fig. 127 a. 

Under  the  typical  assumptions  of  the  shrinking  core  model 
[ 367 , 420 ], and by taking the cognizance of absorption of radiative 
heat ﬂux as a boundary condition, the transformed governing par- 
tial  differential  equations  for  the  temperature  of  core,  dry  layer, 
and for the regression rate of core were solved numerically for a 
kerosene  (represented  by  C 
26 )  gel  droplet  (boiling  point  490 
K) initially at 300 K injected into the hot environment. Fig. 130 
presents the important results of this study for a kerosene gel and 
pyrotechnic in 1:1 proportion.

Fig.  130  mainly  shows  the  lengthening  or  shortening  of  the 
characteristic time scales of the processes including the boiling of 
liquid fuel, pyrotechnic reactions, and the extent of vaporization in 
response to the factors such as the initial droplet diameter, B par- 
ticle loading ( Y B ), chamber pressure ( P C ), and heat ﬂux received on 
the droplet surface ( ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) ). 

Constraints  imposed  by  the  mixing  and  thermal  conductivity 
lead to heat absorption near the surface of droplet. Thus, the initial 
droplet size ( d 
d,0 ) does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the time scale 
for the initial boiling as seen from Fig. 130 a. However, this charac- 
teristic slows down the latter processes in the series and we ob- 
serve lengthened time scales of the pyrotechnic reactions and va- 
porization of core mass as the initial droplet size grows, along with 
a concomitant increase in the thickness of dry layer ( h G ). Higher 
density and heat capacity associated with higher B particle load- 
ings result in longer time scales of the associated processes as seen 
from Fig. 130 b. On the other hand, the amount of heat absorbed 
in the dry layer and the reduced fraction of kerosene available for 
boiling are the opposing conditions. However, the non-monotonic 
variations in h G observed in Fig. 130 b remain to be explained. 

The effects of chamber pressure shown in Fig. 130 c are com-

Solomon  et  al.  [367]  noted  that  the  decomposition  temperature 
of NaClO 
4 based pyrotechnic (710 K) is suﬃciently removed from 
the boiling point of gel (490 K), such that it allows the dry layer 
containing B particles to form with a suﬃcient thickness, unlike 
4  based  pyrotechnic  (decomposes  at  495  K  and  forms  a 
NH 
thin wet layer). Perhaps, better conditions prevail with KClO 
4 based 
pyrotechnic (decomposes at 771 K). It is in these effects that the 
timed sequence of B particle ejection could be realized in practice. 
4  based  pyrotechnic  cluster  main- 
tains  these  suﬃciently  removed  time  scales  in  the  case  of  in- 
volved chamber  pressures.  Further  justiﬁcation for  better  perfor- 
mance of NaClO 
4 based pyrotechnic is obtained in the effects asso- 
ciated with the heat ﬂux shown in Fig. 130 d. In this case too, the

pyrotechnic. However, NaClO

chamber temperature and also by increasing the radiation compo- 
nent of the total heat ﬂux.

6.5. Ignition of gel propellants 

In  this  section,  we  summarize  some  results  of  selected  ex- 
perimental  reports  dealing  with  the  ignition  of  gel  fuel  droplets 
using  high-temperature  particles  [ 346 , 348 ]  and  conventional  hot 
medium [347] , followed by two applications of the Semenov’s ex- 
plosion theory to the gel fuel sprays [ 337 , 349 , 350 ]. 

6.5.1. Ignition by hot particles or medium 

Glushkov et al. [ 346 , 348 ] have reported their experiments and 
simulations on the nature of heat transfer from a small hot solid 
particle  brought  in  contact  with  a  mass  of  gel  fuel  at  very  low 
temperatures. According to them, such a scenario is relevant for 

108 

waste recycling technologies using gel fuels in extremely cold en- 
vironments [346] , ﬁre safety, and ignition studies in general [346] . 
Stages in the heat transfer from a localized source of limited heat 
capacity included in the model are inert heating, melting of near- 
surface layer, vaporization, formation of combustible gas mixture, 
induction, and exothermic reactions. Factors considered include the 
effects  of  particle  shape  and  temperature  (850-1500  K),  type  of 
material (C, Cu, Al, ceramic, steel), and initial temperature of the 
gel  (80-275  K)  on  the  ignition  delay.  The  gel  itself  was  consid- 
ered to be that of hydrazine and unnamed salts of high-molecular 
weight organic acids [346] . The ignition was initiated in the layer 
of gel in immediate contact with the heating surface with a delay 
in the range 0.02-0.8 s. Characteristic size of the hot particle was 
estimated at 10 mm as the upper limit for effectively shortening 
the ignition delay. Further, the minimum heat ﬂux for ignition was 
estimated to be 60 kW/m 2 , although values as high as 950 kW/m 2 
could be achieved. Glushkov et al. [348] have further compared the 
model predictions with experimental data and conﬁrmed the lo- 
cation of ignition. The authors realized that the heat content is a 
dominant factor compared to the others mentioned above. 

Glushkov et al. [347] measured the ignition delays of tethered 
droplets of gel fuel composed of ethanol in which pine resin was 
the gellant and rapeseed oil was the carrier solvent. A fraction of 
Al nanoparticles was also added in some formulations. The data 
for different gels are combined in Fig. 131 . As shown, T C = 873-943 
K was required for the air environment surrounding the droplet. 
The ignition delay, deﬁned as the instant of gas-phase ignition be- 
ginning from the time at which the droplet was introduced in the 
muﬄe furnace, was in the range 0.1-3.3 s. 

Ignition of gel propellant by hot ambient environment was fur- 
ther investigated by Glushkov et al. [ 421 , 422 ] for the cryogels. The 
formulation  of  these  cryogels  was  discussed  in  Section  3.2  (see 
Table 3 , Ref. [144] ). The gel fuel was formulated using an oil emul- 
sion containing 40-60 vol % oil and 2 vol % emulsiﬁer that acts

for  ignition.  Number  of  thermal  cycles  correspond  to  the  12  h 
freezing-12  h  thawing  cycles  in  the  temperature  range  258-293 
K. The gels were tested in the range of even lower temperatures 
( T 0 = 188-233 K). 

6.5.2. Application of Semenov’s thermal explosion theory

as  a  fuel.  Fuel  was  gelled  by  5  and  10  %  PVA.  Glushkov  et  al. 
[422] also mixed 0-30 vol % coal dust as another component of 
fuel. The ignition of gel fuel droplets was investigated under very 
cold  conditions  ( T 0 = 188-233  K)  and  hot  ambient  temperatures 
T a = 873-1273 K. Upon ignition, the ﬂame spread from a hot spot 
(an ignited fragment of the molten droplet) and the droplet then 
fragmented by microexplosion. The measured ignition delays are 
shown in Figs. 132 a and 132 b. 

Evidently,  the  heating  and  melting  considerably  lengthen  the 
ignition delays and also would require higher ambient temperature 
to successfully ignite the cryogels, as seen from Fig. 132 a. Glushkov 
et al. [422] presented their measurements by including droplet di- 
ameter ( d p ) and velocity ( u p ) as parameters ( Fig. 132 b), and also 
obtained a map for the feasible region of ignition in terms of heat- 
ing  intensity  ( ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) ),  as  shown  in  Fig.  132 c.  The  minimum  T a  nec- 
essary for ignition increased to ∼973 K. The convecting droplets 
added convective heat transfer to the radiant heating mechanism 

Zinoviev and Greenberg [349] employed Semenov’s thermal ex- 
plosion theory to track the evolution of organic gel droplet sub- 
jected  to  pulsating  vaporization  in  a  hot  ambient  environment 
within the framework for a monodisperse spray and adiabatic con- 
ditions. It was further assumed that the heat ﬂux triggering the 
processes  is  directly  proportional  to  the  temperature  difference 
d − T ∞ ) between the droplet and ambient, pressure changes are 
( T 
negligible,  and  the  kinetics  is  adequately  represented  by  a  ﬁrst- 
order  reaction.  While  heat  ﬂux  triggers  all  the  subsequent  pro- 
cesses, only the ultimate effect, that of an oscillatory release of va- 
pors is used in the mathematical description. Under its inﬂuence, 
the droplet surface area changes and affects the ignition dynam- 
ics. Equations governing the dynamics in terms of the dimension- 
less temperature ( θ
nd ) 
were adopted from a previous study by Goldfarb et al. [350] . Os- 
cillatory release of the vapors is governed by a function ζ w ( τ ) in 
the form of a square wave, see inset in Fig. 133 .

Following  the  arguments  of  Semenov’s  theory  [423] ,  the  dimen-

for ignition is given by Eq. (43b) .

plode before vaporization is involved. From Eq. (43b) , delayed ex- 
plosion occurs for ( (cid:2)

and Greenberg [349] investigated the explosion of a monodisperse 
gel spray subject to (cid:2)
2  and obtained 
the curves shown in Figs. 133 a and 133 b for the time-histories of 
involved  variables.  Conditions  for  which  the  initial  gas  tempera- 
ture  exceeds  the  saturation  temperature  ( θ s = -1)  are  covered  in 
Fig. 133 c and they can be compared against Fig. 133 a. A decrease 
in (cid:2)

2 induces longer delay until ignition. 

Delay in explosion is also predicted to be longer when the ini- 
tial temperature of gas is higher than the saturation temperature. It 
is accompanied by initial drop in the gas temperature as seen from 
Fig. 133 c. Further, all the variables characterizing the system show 
oscillatory behavior induced by ζ w ( τ ) given in Eq. (42) , unlike the 
case with nongelled liquid droplets. Delay time was also found to 
be proportional to the reciprocal of initial gas concentration [349] . 
Goldfarb et al. [350] also explored the dynamical behavior of this 
system. 

Nave  et  al.  [337]  extended  the  application  of  Semenov’s  ex- 
plosion  theory  to  polydisperse  sprays  of  gel  droplets  in  which 
the  ’parcel’  approach  of  modeling  sprays  was  compared  against 
the  commonly  used  droplet  size  distributions  including  the  log- 
normal, Rosin-Rammler, and Nukiyama-Tanasawa functions. Proba- 
bility density function was used to implement the parcel approach. 
In  their  modeling  framework,  which  is  similar  in  some  respect 
to  the  one  used  by  Greenberg  and  coworkers  [ 349 , 350 ],  the  os- 
cillations  are  induced  in  the  heat  ﬂux  by  a  sinusoidal  function 

similar  to  Goldfarb  et  al.  [350] .  The  resulting  dynamical  system 
of  gas-phase  temperature,  fuel  concentration,  and  droplet  radius 
was solved to yield the behavior of these variables, as shown in 
Fig. 134 . 

It conﬁrms the observations previously made by Zinoviev and 
Greenberg [349] on the propagation of oscillations in the involved 
variables and also indicates that the monodisperse approximation 
tends to suppress their propagation unlike the various approxima- 
tions of polydisperse sprays. In particular, monodisperse approx- 
imation  predicts  a  longer  delay  ( Fig.  134 a).  In  their  predictions 
( Figs. 134a-134c ), the sharp oscillations are especially prominent in 
case of temperature ( θ
nd = 1), again 
similar to the predictions of Ref. [349] shown in Fig. 133 . It would 
be recalled from the discussion of Section 5.8.3 that the droplet 
size distributions in gel propellant sprays are often broad and bi- 
or multi-modal.

Conventional hypergolic propellants include many compounds 
of  hydrazine  class  such  as  hydrazine  (N

(UDMH, C

ered in many previous studies discussed in Section 3 .

6.6.1. Overview 

Ignition of the hypergolic gel propellants has received consider- 
able attention and we now discuss the state of the art in this area 
with the help of Table 22 . 

According  to  the  information  in  Table  22 ,  ignition  of  hyper- 
golic gel propellants has been studied using conventional oxidizer 
drop tests (for example, Refs. [ 35 , 353 ]) and impinging jet appara-

tus [ 90 , 152 , 213 , 227 , 362 , 363 , 424 ]. A couple of studies are devoted 
to the modeling of ignition process itself [ 38 , 361 ]. 

While  gelation  improves  handling  of  the  hazardous,  conven- 
tional  hypergolic  propellants,  less  toxic  hypergolic  bipropellants 
can also replace them. Accordingly, while kerosene-H 
2 is a non- 
hypergolic  bipropellant  by  itself,  Natan  et  al.  [35]  ﬁrst  demon-

strated  that  reactive  sodium  borohydride  (NaBH 
pended in the kerosene gel enable hypergolic ignition and com- 
bustion with hydrogen peroxide.

6.6.2. Oxidizer drop tests 

Among the possible combinations of gels and bipropellant hy- 
pergolics,  gelation  could  be  applied  to  fuel  and  oxidizer  liquid 
could  be  nongelled.  Oxidizer  drops  can  then  be  impinged  on  a 
static  gel  fuel  blob  and  the  ignition  delay  time  could  be  mea- 
sured  using  some  form  of  high-speed  imaging  techniques.  Cur- 
rently available test data shown in Table 22 (for Refs. [ 35 , 90 , 424 ]) 
suggest that some combinations of hypergolic gel propellants are 
satisfactory in that their ignition delay times are reasonably short.

Lastufka et al. [92] investigated the hypergolic ignition limit and 
dual ﬂame structures of MMH-HPC gel droplet. It was suddenly ex- 
2  at 
posed to an environment of NTO (N 
2.9 bar. Hypergolic ignition was possible for as low as 15 % NTO 
by pressure and dual ﬂame structure was not discernible near the 
ignition limit. He et al. [ 55 , 97 ] considered UDMH and a polymeric 
gellant in NTO environment and have used their observations in 
a  comprehensive  theoretical  treatment  of  the  ignition  problem. 
Recent attempts have focused on ethanol [57] and ethanolamine 
[58]  gels  in  which,  catalysts  are  used  to  induce  hypergolicity. 
Ricker  et  al.  [425]  utilized  transition  metal  based  nanoparticles

(Ag, Pt, MnO

(high test peroxide, HTP) bipropellant. The base bipropellant is not 
hypergolic  [425] .  TMEDA  was  gelled  with  a  silica  based  gellant. 
Nanoparticles were synthesized in laboratory and were of the sizes 
37.4-78.6 nm (Ag), 73.5 nm (Pt), and 67.7 nm (MnO 
2 ). The cata- 
lyst was dispersed in TMEDA, heated to 60 °C while adding gel- 
lant under continuous stirring. The solution was then cooled at 1 
°C. As expected, the quality of formulations proved to be an im- 
portant factor in the minimization of ignition delay ( t ID ). Particu- 
larly, the stabilization of catalyst using capping agents, dispersion 
in  ethanol,  and  use  of  Ag  nanoparticles  shortened  the  delay  to 
8.8 ms. 

2 ) in small quantities of 1 or 5 % for TMEDA-H 

Majority  of  these  studies  demonstrate  bipropellant  systems 
for  their  hypergolicity  in  gel  form.  However,  more  studies  fo- 
cusing  on  the  ignition  of  hypergolic  gel  droplets  are  still 
required.

6.6.3. Hypergolic ignition using impinging jets 

Doublet  impinging  jets  [ 90 , 152 , 213 , 227 , 362 , 363 , 424 ]  are  the 
most commonly used among the available impinging jet conﬁgura- 
tions. Development of the spray downstream of the impingement 
point is crucial for ignition performance as discussed subsequently 
in  Section  6.6.5 .  Since  bipropellants  of  different  physicochemical 
properties are involved, the jet diameter and ﬂow rates are appro- 
priately matched and care is taken to follow the recommendations 
of the Rupe parameter as far as possible [ 213 , 227 ]. 

Fig. 135 illustrates a false color sequence of the events leading 
up to the successful ignition of MMH-RFNA hypergolic bipropellant 
system gelled using 6 % and 3 % Aerosil in panel 1 . Images in the 
bottom panel 2 are for MMH-RFNA system. 

For the base bipropellant system, they indicate the location of 
eventually successful ignition kernel some distance below the im- 
pingement point (images at t = 0 and 2 ms instants) followed by 
another ignition kernel near the injector face ( t = 4 ms). Both the 
kernels developed and merged in the latter stages ( t = 8 ms). For 
the gel propellant, successful ignition kernel initiated near the im- 
pingement  point  ( t = 0  in  panel  1 )  and  ﬂame  propagated  down- 
stream in the latter stages ( t = 2-8 ms in panel 1 ). Flames spread 
from the ignition point in keeping with the sheet property differ- 
ences between the two propellant systems such that wider ﬂames 
existed for MMH-RFNA. 

Dennis  et  al.  [424]  suggested  that  the  ignition  events  are 
controlled  by  rheological  nature  of  the  gel  propellant  and  the

thixotropic behavior of silica gels (and resulting low viscosity after 
impingement) is likely to aid ignition when compared with HPC 
[ 150 , 424 , 426 ].  It  is  noted  here  that  the  ignition  kernel  locations 
for gel propellants made hypergolic by the addition of the reac- 
4 particles are to be found away from the impingement 
tive NaBH

6.6.4. Parametric investigations: composition and other effects 

Different kinds of parametric effects have been reported in the 
studies on impinging jets, effects of additive NaBH 
4 [227] , oxidizer 
concentration [227] , type of hydrocarbon fuel [227] , injector effects 
[213] , jet lead time effects [227] , jet velocity effects [ 213 , 227 ], and 
overall equivalence ratio effects [213] , are the chief among them. 
At the outset, we note that ignition events are probabilistic in na- 
ture  and  their  estimates  involve  considerable  uncertainty.  In  the 
results shown in the following, the uncertainty is usually expressed 
in terms of standard deviations. However, we do not show uncer- 
tainty estimates over the data points for the sake of clarity in ﬁg- 
ures.

Following  the  encouraging  demonstrations  of  Natan  et  al. 
4  additive  particles  to  transform 
[35]  on  the  ability  of  NaBH 
the  conventional  gel  propellants  into  hypergols,  Connell  et  al. 
[227] worked with the ignition characteristics of the silica based 
gels of n-dodecane (n-C 
16 ), and kerosene 
mixed with NaBH 
4 . These authors [227] also reported the formu- 
lation steps in detail and the startup transients of feed and ﬂow 
systems. Using high-speed imaging, they recorded the ’time of ﬁrst

inﬂuence of larger volumetric heat capacities and vaporization en- 
thalpies of higher hydrocarbons on the use of limited heat avail- 
able in an ignition kernel [227] . System startup effect is also ob- 
served in Figs. 136 a and 136 b and a fuel leading time of 250 ms 
over the oxidizer jet reduced the scatter and caused a signiﬁcant 
shortening  of  the  ignition  onset  for  n-dodecane.  Further,  experi- 
mental evidence of Fig. 136 b shows that the decrease in the igni-

Ignition  time  scales  shown  in  Fig.  136 c  depict  the  strong  ef- 
fect of H

It is strong enough to improve the relatively poor performance of 
kerosene (shown by ● in Fig. 136 c). It seems that H 
2 decomposi- 
tion affects the post-ignition ﬂame spread by providing additional 
heat for the sustained growth of ignition kernel.

Velocity  effects  invariably  enter  into  the  consideration  since 
propellants  of  different  physicochemical  properties  are  used  in 
the impinging jets. Accordingly, fuel and oxidizer jet velocity ( u 
j,f 
j,o ), fuel-oxidizer velocity ratio ( VR ), momentum ratio ( MR ), 
and u 
and  momentum  ﬂux  ratio  ( MFR )  are  the  parameters,  in  which 
the  velocity  effects  are  inherent.  Fig.  137  compiles  the  avail- 
able  data  [ 213 , 424 ]  related  to  the  velocity  effects  on  the  igni- 
tion time scales. Fig. 137 a shows a minor dependence on the ve- 
locity  of  fuel  jet  for  the  MMH-Aerosil  gel  impinging  on  RFNA- 

113 

Aerosil gel. The ignition delay time ( t ID ) is similar irrespective of 
gelation. 

Fig. 137 b shows the variations in which the parametric effects 
of three doublet impinging jet injector conﬁgurations on the ig- 
nition time  scales [213]  are  carefully  minimized by  using  scaled 
jo  in  the  combinations  0.98/1.89  mm  ( (cid:2), (cid:3)), 
injector  pairs  ( d 
1.27/2.46  mm  ( ◦, ●),  and  1.65/3.18  mm  ( ×,  ×))  and  proportional 
changes in the ﬂow rates such that VR is held constant. Hence, the 
onset of ignition was advanced by increasing the velocity of fuel jet 
( u 
j,f ) up to a certain velocity, beyond which the effect diminished. 
Time of ﬁrst light also decreased slightly.

Authors  [213]  have  noted  that  the  variations  in  the  ranges 
of  MR = 0.12-1.0,  MFR = 0.12-8.09,  R R = 0.12-2.84  could  be  used 
to  improve  the  mixing  and  atomization  such  that  considerable 
gains in combustion eﬃciency are likely. Additionally, such exper- 
iments  could  also  help  in  the  search  for  minimum  time  scales.

It is observed that the doublet and triplet impinging jet conﬁg- 
urations yield similar scales for onset of ignition, while they are 
signiﬁcantly lengthened for quintuplet injector, presumably due to 
the reduced interfacial area in the case of quintuplet. This reduc- 
tion is attributed to the conical shape of sheet downstream of im- 
pingement in contrast with a ﬂat sheet of the doublet and triplet

injectors. Oxidizer impingement velocities were held ﬁxed in these 
experiments. Total oxidizer injector cross-sectional area was ﬁxed 
for all injectors by making appropriate variations in the oriﬁce di- 
ameters in order to meaningfully compare different injectors. Con- 
stant  mass  ﬂow  rates  were  also  used  for  the  fuel  and  oxidizer 
streams. 

Diameters of the oxidizer injector were changed to obtain the 
data  shown  in  Fig.  138 b  over  a  range  of  fuel-lean  and  fuel-rich 
global  equivalence  ratios  ( φ).  On  an  average,  the  differences  in 
time scales were not signiﬁcant. Behavior of the impinging jets as 
noted above is governed by the kinetics of condensed phase reac- 
tion and ignition for the bipropellant system, which is discussed in 
Section 6.6.5 . 

At least one study by Dennis et al. [424] estimated the c ∗-based 
combustion eﬃciency of hypergolic gel propellants using the dou- 

blet  impinging  jets  conﬁguration.  The  high-pressure  combustion 
experiments showed greater ﬂuctuations in the traces of chamber 
pressure  and  lower  combustion  eﬃciency  (by  as  much  as  26  %) 
was obtained. At present, a large number of possible parameters 
are likely [424] and signiﬁcant further work is necessary in this 
direction. 

Ignition of TMEDA-RFNA and TMEDA-WFNA hypergols and their 
hypergolic  gels  has  been  extensively  examined  [99] .  Two  differ- 
ent  grades  of  silica  were  used.  Inert  silica  was  considered  es- 
sential  to  prevent  any  reactive  interactions  between  the  pro- 
pellant  and  gellant.  TMEDA  was  gelled  with  4.5  %  silica  (EH- 
5)  and  WFNA  or  RFNA  were  gelled  with  3  %  M-5.  Drop  tests 
and  momentum  matched  doublet  impinging  jets  were  used  to 
estimate  the  ignition  delay,  as  shown  in  Figs.  139 a  and  139 b, 
respectively.

Presence of the gellants seems to have dramatically reduced the 
ignition delay times ( t ID ) in Fig. 139 a. The ignition delay appears 
to be affected by the droplet-blob interactions after the collision 
and the continuity of contact after collision. Further, access to the 
trapped propellants might also become diﬃcult at higher Y G , lead- 
ing to longer t ID , as observed from Fig. 139 a. Momentum matched 
doublet impinging jets (momentum ratio, MR ∼1) of base propel- 
lants  and  their  gels  give  very  similar  ignition  delays.  Fig.  139 b 
shows  no  signiﬁcant  effect  of  the  presence  of  gellants  on  t ID .  It 
appears that the contact regime between fuel and oxidizer jets is 
similar.

Connell et al. [227] have modeled the kinetics of hypergolic ig-

nition involving NaBH 
tion  process  for  n-C 
16  gels  was  described  using 
single-step  condensed-phase  reaction  and  the  existing  gas-phase 
multi-step kinetics models to estimate the ignition delay times (us- 
ing the time required for rapid temperature rise in the gas phase). 
Condensed-phase kinetics was based on the reaction in Eq. (44a) . 
The  rate  constant  was  estimated  by  Eq.  (44b)  with  the  help  of 
counterﬂow T-reactor experiments in which, the temperature rise

reaction was relatively insensitive to the type of hydrocarbon fuel

6.6.6. Theoretical analysis 

Hypergolic ignition occurs at the interface between fuel and ox- 
idizer (see for example the treatment in Ref. [227] ) and theoretical 
analysis of the ignition of hypergolic gel droplets is also predicated 
on this premise. Williams [38] presented a ﬁrst-generation model 
for the ignition of a generic hypergolic gel propellant analyzing the 
heat conduction processes at the gel fuel-oxidizer interface and ac- 
tivation energy asymptotics. The analysis developed Eq. (45) for the 
ignition time ( t

In above equation, the constant c = 1.5 and the term ( k

called the thermal responsivity of the propellant ( i ≡ f, o ). We ob- 
serve that the ignition delay additionally is a function of the activa- 
tion energy ( E ) of hypergolic reaction, heat released per unit time 
and per unit area ( ˙ Q (cid:3)(cid:3) ), and the initial temperature at the interface 
( T I,0 ). Hassid and Natan [361] have noted that the exponential term 
in Eq. (45) is likely to result in a very high temperature.

Under  the  assumptions  of  high  activation  energy  and  single- 
step zero-order reaction, the ignition delay would be longer if ther- 
mal conductivity ( k ) is increased and would be shorter if thermal 
diffusivity ( α), T I , 0 , or  ˙ Q (cid:3)(cid:3) were increased. Williams [38] suggested 
that Eq. (45) could be used to correlate the ignition time data and 
also in the investigation of pressure spikes at the moment of igni- 
tion. 

Hassid and Natan [361] improved Williams’ analysis [38] by as- 
suming that propagation of the heat wave could be described by a 

In Eq. (46) , T o and Q o are the ambient temperature and initial 
heat  ﬂux,  respectively.  Integrated  heat  ﬂux  released  towards  the

Current hypergolic ignition models [ 38 , 361 ] for the gel bipro-

lants including HPC have been mainly considered. A number of the 
parametric effects including the static or convective ambient atmo- 
sphere, diluent  concentration, combustion  chamber pressure and 
temperature have been considered. High-speed imaging has been 
exclusively used in the studies, with a few cases in which temper- 
atures were measured. 

6.7.1. Phenomenological description 

Experimental  studies  published  so  far  [ 42 , 55 , 92 , 94 , 97 ]  build 
upon the processes known to occur during the vaporization and 
combustion of a hypergolic fuel-oxidizer combination (see for ex- 
ample, Refs. [ 400 , 427-429 ]). In the following, we discuss the phe- 
nomenological  nature  of  hypergolic  gel  droplet  combustion  be- 
ginning  with  the  observations  of  inner  and  outer  ﬂames.  Ref. 
[400] can be consulted for a background on the structure of hy- 
drazine droplet ﬂames. Inner ﬂame is due to the decomposition of 
3  and H 
fuel and the outer ﬂame is due to the oxidation of NH 
2 
emitted during decomposition [400] . 

Lastufka et al. [92] experimented with the combustion of MMH- 
3 % HPC droplet in NTO environment diluted by N 
2  to study the 
hypergolic ignition and dilution effects on the dynamics of inner 
and outer ﬂames. Their experimental data are compiled in Fig. 143 .

taining ∼85 % N

parison.  In  addition  to  the  phenomenological  description  above, 
Solomon et al. [42] have reported the parametric effects of droplet 
diameter, chamber pressure, and gellant concentration on the com- 
bustion and jetting frequency. Accordingly, the combustion rate de- 
pends on the initial droplet diameter similar to the known case of 
MMH but not on the chamber pressure. Results on the jetting fre- 
quency are however inconclusive. 

Feng et al. [94] studied the effects of convective velocity ( u conv ) 
and  temperature  ( T o )  of  the  NTO  oxidizer  medium  on  the  his- 
tory of droplet diameter variations using the free-falling droplets 
of UDMH, as shown in Fig. 145 . 

In contrast to the other studies, they found relatively smooth 
trace in the beginning of the vaporization and combustion process, 
to be followed by bubble nucleation, expansion and jetting for a 
period as shown in Fig. 145 . Higher convective velocity increased 
the intensity of ﬂuctuations as shown in Fig. 145 a and similar ef- 
fect was observed for increase in the initial temperature of oxidizer 
( Fig. 145 b). In both cases, the ﬂame was sensitive to variations in 
the parameters. The interactions of inner and outer ﬂames com- 
bined with favorable changes in the combustion rate leading to an 
increased swelling and jetting have been cited for the observed be- 
havior [94] . 

Experiments above thus indicate that the processes occurring 
during vaporization and combustion of a hypergolic gel droplet are 
an amalgamation of vaporization and combustion of a typical or- 
ganic  gel  droplet  and  a  hypergolic  bipropellant  droplet.  The  gel 
droplet undergoes jetting and other processes known for organic 
gel droplet [24] during its lifetime. In fact, modeling efforts by He 
and coworkers [ 55 , 97 ] discussed below rely heavily on the com- 
bined phenomenological construct of organic non-hypergolic and 
hypergolic gel droplets. 

6.7.2. Mathematical modeling 

Most detailed modeling of the vaporization and combustion of 
a hypergolic organic gel droplet to date has been attempted by He 
and coworkers [ 55 , 97 ] with the help of experiments on UDMH gel 
droplet in NTO environment [ 55 , 97 ]. The gelling was achieved with 
a synthetic polymer dissolved directly in UDMH at room tempera- 
ture. Their model is again based on the observations of oscillatory 
vaporization, ejection of jet, and combustion of organic gel droplets 
and includes elements of previous models. The details are shown 
in Fig. 146 . 

As  discussed in the  phenomenology of  hypergolic gel droplet 
vaporization and combustion in Section 6.7.1 , the model considers 
three stages 1: formation of gellant layer ( 2 ), 2: swelling due to 
bubble dynamics, and 3: rupture of the gellant layer due to jetting. 
Droplet core ( 1 ) and the two ﬂame fronts ( 3 , 4 ) are included in the 
modeling framework. A set of governing equations for continuity,

and outer ﬂames was established for the gel droplet over a range 
of dilutions as shown in Figs. 143 b and 143 c. Also apparent are the 
effects of characteristic swelling and jetting events during the life- 
time of combusting droplets. The inner decomposition ﬂame front 
approached towards the outer oxidation ﬂame front after ∼60 % 
N 
2  was added, and both fronts almost merged near the ignition 
limit, as seen from Fig. 143 c. The relative ﬂame position depicted 
in Fig. 143 d also indicates this behavior. 

Lastufka et al. [92] also noted similarities in the trends of ﬂame 
thickness obtained for gel droplet case with the data obtained by 
Lawver [427] , albeit with the ﬂuctuations due to swelling and jet- 
ting superimposed. The causes behind the observed behavior re- 
main largely unexplored at present. 

Solomon  et  al.  [42]  conducted  experiments  on  MMH  gel 
droplets in which HPC and Aerosil were used as gellants. A vis- 
cous solvent tetraglyme was used for comparison of the outer lay- 
ers. Fluctuations in the volume of droplets and their combustion 
behavior as extracted from the high-speed movies are shown in 
Fig. 144 . 

MMH-tetraglyme  droplet  was  combusted  in  the  ambient  air. 
Volume  ﬂuctuations  in  MMH-HPC  gel  droplets  occurred  during 
combustion  and  MMH-tetraglyme  droplet  experienced  increased 
frequency of ﬂuctuations. These ﬂuctuations were characterized by 
the swelling and jetting as usual. However, MMH-Aerosil droplet 
underwent shattering explosions of the shell followed by up to 50 
% shrinkage in the volume (inset, Fig. 144 ). 

This behavior is associated with the properties of the gellant 
layer covering the droplet, since tetraglyme layer is very viscous, 
HPC layer is relatively rigid, and Aerosil layer is very rigid in com-

the  far  ﬁeld  and  center  of  the  droplet  are  Neumann  type  (as- 
signed  constant  0)  while  the  droplet  surface  admits  elaborate 
time-dependent conditions [55] . Gas-phase kinetics of UDMH and 
NTO is handled using a multi-step mechanism consisting of 550 
elementary reactions among 83 species to comprehensively model 
the decomposition ( 3 ) and oxidation ( 4 ) fronts [55] . Regression of 
droplet  is  handled  by  a  coordinate  transformation  of  radius  and 
velocity variables [55] . 

During the calculation, ﬁrst stage is assumed to complete when 
Y G = 0.95  at  the  droplet  surface  beginning  from  heating  at  t = 0. 
Swelling is accompanied by a rise in the droplet temperature above 
the boiling point of UDMH in the second stage that culminates in 
the rupture of gellant layer triggered once the tensile stress in the 
layer exceeds the yield stress. Thus, one swell-rupture phase is cal- 
culated in ( ζ r , t ) space, at the end of which, location of Y G = 0.95 
is used to update the thickness of gellant layer in the next swell- 
rupture phase, until a time instant when all the liquid has vapor- 
ized or when the ratio of the instantaneous and initial droplet ra- 
dius, r 2 / r 2 
o < 0 . 1 . He et al. [97] used this model to produce addi- 
tional results on the ignition delay and droplet lifetime. 

The  model  was  validated  on  a  millimeter-scale  droplet  free- 
falling  in  a  convective  atmosphere  of  NTO  at  u conv = 0.3  m/s, 
T C = 373 K, and P C = 1 atm by comparing its predictions with the 
droplet size history [55] . It was noted that the predicted ampli- 
tudes  of  oscillations  differed  from  the  experimentally  observed 
ones due to a limiting assumption of the ejection of all vapor at 
the  rupture  stage.  Apart  from  this,  the  general  trend  of  droplet 
temperature as known from other experiments [148] , was also re- 
produced in the model [55] . We now discuss the important results 
of these studies in the following. It is noted that the droplet diam- 
d,0 = 100 μm and it is rep- 
eter considered in these simulations is d 
resentative of the droplet sizes present in practical sprays. Fig. 147 
shows the characteristic ﬂuctuations in the surface properties of

ﬂ) and standoff distances ( r 

These  ﬂuctuations  also  induced  ﬂuctuations  in  the  tempera- 
ture ( T 
ﬂ/r s ) of the inner (decomposition) 
ﬂame as in Fig. 147 c and outer (oxidation) ﬂame as in Fig. 147 d. 
The induced ﬂuctuations diminished in amplitude. Fig. 147 b shows 

119 

the instance of hypergolic ignition ( 1 ) followed by the formation of 
gellant layer ( 2 ). The regular frequency observed in the oscillations 
of the surface properties (see also Fig. 149 ) is usually not to be 
found in the experiments since many other perturbation mecha- 
nisms are at work, most of which are not considered in the model. 
Changes in the properties of liquid phase contained in the core 
of droplet are shown in Fig. 148 for liquid temperature ( T 
l ) and 
gellant mass fraction ( Y G ) as proﬁle and instantaneous values. For 
d,0 = 100 μm), the authors note that a part of the 
a small droplet ( d 
heat ﬂux from the ﬂame is utilized for vaporizing a small amount 
of UDMH and the rest is used in heating such that the droplet tem- 
perature continued to rise beyond the boiling point (335.5 K) of 
UDMH, as shown in Fig. 148 a. The consequent increase in the gel- 
lant concentration is shown in Fig. 148 b. Temperature proﬁles at 
different time instants are shown in Fig. 148 c. Since the diffusion 
of gellant is ﬁnite, we observe the proﬁles as shown in Fig. 148 d. 

In another study, He et al. [97] used the model developed in 
Ref. [55] for predicting the combustion behavior of 100 μm droplet 
under the conditions reminiscent of startup of engine ( P C = 0.051 
MPa and T C = 400 K) as well as a running engine ( P C = 0.912 MPa, 
T C = 20 0 0 K). These results are summarized in Fig. 149 . 

Using  the  ﬂuctuations  in  droplet  diameter  as  shown  in 
Figs. 149 a and 149 b, they concluded that the high working pres- 
sure resulted in a prolonged swelling and jetting period, which un- 
der the physical conditions could correspond to the diﬃculty expe- 
rienced in bubble nucleation. The effects are observed in Fig. 149 d 
in which, the ﬂame extinction occurred due to the depletion of fuel 
under the conditions similar to a running engine [97] . Fig. 150 a 
d,s ) 
shows the temporal variations of droplet surface temperature ( T 
for the two states of engine operation. 

In the startup stage marked by low temperature and pressure, 
an initial rise ( 1 ) in the temperature is noted due to ignition and 
another rise ( 2 ) in succession due to the formation of gellant layer 
and  buildup  of  heat  in  the  droplet  core.  Fig.  150 b  and  the  en- 
larged section in the adjacent panel show the temporal variations 
in the temperature of outer ﬂame. As anticipated, these variations 
are heavily inﬂuenced by the gas-phase kinetics of UDMH-NTO re- 
actions.  Accordingly,  the  time-spans  within  which  the  stages  of 
droplet heating, induction, ignition, and decomposition of UDMH 
vapors are completed depend upon the engine conditions. Hence, 
a delayed emergence of the inner and outer ﬂame can be observed 
during startup in comparison to the running state of engine. The 
observed decrease in the ignition delay time ( t ID ) and droplet life- 
time ( t 

b ) is presented in Fig. 151 . 

A  decreasing  trend  in  these  time  scales  is  observed  with  in- 
creasing  temperature  and  pressure,  as  seen  from  Fig.  151 .  How- 
ever, the low temperature condition could lead to ﬂameout (also 
observed experimentally) at some pressure, leading to an abrupt 
increase  in  the  droplet  lifetime.  This  situation  is  observed  in

sider the reactions occurring during collision of the same set of 
droplets.  In  the  simulations  performed  with  reactions,  a  multi- 
step  reduced  chemical  kinetic  mechanism  was  used  for  the  ki- 
netics  of  liquid-phase,  gas  decomposition,  and  combustion  reac- 
tions. Gellant was assumed as an inert species and superheating 
of  the  liquid  phases  is  ignored.  The  aftermath  of  reactive  colli- 
sions  for  MMH-RFNA  and  MMH-6  %  silica  /  RFNA-3  %  silica  are 
shown  in  Figs.  152  and  153 .  The  contours  of  temperature  are 
shown in blackbody scale in which T < 400 K denotes transparent 
medium. Only a slice of the temperature ﬁeld is shown in these 
ﬁgures. 

In  Fig.  152 ,  the  liquid  hypergols  are  shown  to  form  gas  lay- 
ers immediately between the droplets and mixing is stopped. Suc- 
cessful  ignition  occurs  in  the  gas  layer  in  the  regions  closest  to 
the  contact  line  where  mixing  is  suﬃcient.  A  number  of  differ- 
ences were observed between the liquid and gel hypergols [89] . 
In  the  simpliﬁed  simulations,  these  differences  are  chieﬂy  due 
to  the  rheological  complexity  of  the  gel  droplets.  As  shown  in 
Fig. 153 , MMH gel fuel droplet ﬂattened due to its lower viscos- 
ity so that gas layer formed differently than the MMH-RFNA case 
(see Fig. 152 ). This caused more separation of the gel propellant 
droplets. 

Deformation  of  droplets  is  also  observed  to  be  less  in  the 
case  of  gels  due  to  overall  high  viscosity  in  the  regions  away 
from  impact  line,  as  shown  in  Fig.  154  and  also  observed  from 
Fig.  153 .  Gel  droplets  are  also  expected  to  recover  slowly  from 
collision.  Sampling  of  the  maximum  temperature  ( T max )  reached 
in  the  gas  layer  suggests  that  gas  decomposition  occurred  ear- 
lier  in  the  MMH-RFNA  hypergols.  The  interface  easily  reached 
high  enough  temperature  for  gas-phase  ignition  and  combus- 
tion,  as  shown  in  Fig.  154 ,  even  while  the  droplets  were  drift- 
ing  apart.  On  the  other  hand,  delayed  and  weak  decomposition 
reactions  in  the  gas  phase  of  MMH-RFNA  gel  hypergols  failed 
to  ignite  combustion  as  the  droplets  were  drifting  apart.  Com- 
plete  coalescence  of  hypergolic  gel  droplets  is  thus  essential  for 
ignition.

6.8.1. Slurry fuels: experiments and modeling 

Slurry fuels in which the solid loading is high (usually in ex- 
cess of 50 %) tend to behave similar to the gel fuels, mainly due to 
the perceived role of superﬁne particles as ‘pseudo gellant’ [114] . 
Nevertheless, gellants also have been used to improve the slurry 
stability  in  some  studies  discussed  below.  Metal  slurries  are  es- 
pecially attractive for propulsion applications, be it ramjet propul- 
sion [ 60 , 114 , 391 ] or afterburners [60] , and have been studied as 
such [ 60 , 64 , 232 , 381 , 382 , 386 , 390 , 391 ]. We are concerned here with 
the  description  of  selected  experimental  and  theoretical  results

obtained for the spray combustion of highly loaded slurry fuels. 
These results are summarized in Table 24 . 

Studies conducted at NACA [ 64 , 381 , 382 ] covered performance 
measurements  of  JP-3  slurries  with  Mg  and  B.  The  loadings 
achieved in these programs are up to 60 wt %. Although the re- 
sults have not been analyzed, the available experimental data give 
an encouraging outlook for Mg (and to some extent B) slurry fuels. 
Accordingly, combustion stability of slurry fuels is better than JP- 
3 in the range φ = 0-1.4 [64] , with improvements noted as metal 
loading ( Y M ) was increased. Thus, improvements in thrust and air 
speciﬁc impulses were 51 % and 14 % over JP-3 when Y M = 60 % 
[64] , along with concomitant improvements in fuel consumption. 
Although, oxide layer deposited on the combustor walls reduced 
the heat transfer, the deposition itself was not serious [64] . High 
reactivity of Mg slurries was also noticed. Further data on the su- 
periority of Mg over B were obtained in terms of combustion eﬃ- 
ciency [381] and complexities associated with particle size, crystal 
structure, and gellant were uncovered [ 381 , 382 ]. Important conclu- 
sions of these studies are that metal can be combusted with sim- 
ilar eﬃciency as a hydrocarbon [381] and particle size of metal is 
a very important factor that affects combustion in many different 
ways. 

Peleg and Timnat [391] successfully achieved still higher load- 
ings  of  B  (up  to  80  wt  %)  and  Al  (up  to  70  wt  %)  in  kerosene 
slurries  combusted  under  ramjet  conditions  in  a  dump  combus- 
tor. They obtained average eﬃciencies (based on c ∗ velocity) in the 
range of 80 % for Al and B at fuel-air ratios 0.05-0.18 and 0.05-

(stoichiometric fuel-air ratio 0.225) and straddle the stoichiomet- 
ric ratio (0.091) for B [391] . Peleg and Timnat noted that the use 
of B is constrained by its ignition temperature and that the wall 
insulation helped in ignition of B [391] . 

Sirignano  and  Bhatia  [390]  have  used  theoretical  analysis  to 
show that the ignition of metal fraction is not possible simply by 
using the heat from combustion of liquid fuel fraction in a metal 
slurry fuel droplet. They found that ignition would require the heat 
released from combustion of surrounding droplets in the cloud and 
vitiated  air.  The  spray  ﬂame  calculations  are  thus  invariably  re- 
quired  for  realistically  treating  metal  slurry  droplet  combustion. 
Hence,  the  calculations  used  the  approximation  of  pre-speciﬁed 
metal slurry droplet streams in parallel to the ﬂow of combustion 
air, supplemented by phenomenological description of the stages 
of metal slurry droplet combustion. On these bases, Sirignano and 
Bhatia [390] found that droplet ignition is facilitated by a premixed 
vapor-air ﬂame at the inlet to the combustor, followed by two dif- 
fusion ﬂames in the downstream for remaining hydrocarbon fuel 
and metal fraction, in that sequence. 

They  also  noted  that  metal  combustion  kinetics  could  affect 
the  structure  of  these  diffusion  ﬂames.  The  number  of  parallel 
droplet streams (or packing density) did not affect metal ignition 
and burning times. Burning times would increase with metal load- 
ing and the ratio of metal particle diameter with the initial droplet 
diameter [390] . It was also reported that the minimum ambient 
temperature requirements for metal ignition in a stream of slurry 
droplets do not match that for an isolated droplet. 

In  their  detailed  studies  on  the  metalized  slurry  propellants, 
Mueller and Turns [ 329 , 330 , 385 ] noted that the large droplets of 
RP-1-Al slurries undergo secondary atomization due to the defor- 
mation of surface layer. According to them, the secondary droplets 
are of similar size as Al agglomerates and the secondary breakup is 
crucial for subsequent ignition and combustion of metal agglomer- 
ates. Mueller and Turns have published a model for the secondary 
breakup and two-phase losses [325] . 

6.8.2. Gel fuels: modeling 

Theoretical analyses  of  gel propellant spray ﬂames  by  Green- 
berg and coworkers [ 25 , 351 , 357-360 , 365 , 376 ] have used the results 
obtained from experiments on gel droplet combustion composed 
of an organic gellant (e.g. Refs. [ 20 , 23 , 24 , 378 ]). Table 25 summa- 

123 

rizes the studies done so far on these lines. These studies analyze 
the effects of oscillatory vaporization of organic gel droplets on the 
properties of spray ﬂames using the vaporization frequency ( f vap ). 
A canonical laminar Burke-Schumann type diffusion ﬂame is em- 
ployed in which, modiﬁcations due to Greenberg [404] (see also 
Refs. [406-408] ) are introduced to account for the presence of en- 
semble of liquid droplets. Treatment of the droplets is based on the 
sectional approach of Greenberg et al. [405] (see also Laurent and 
Massot  [410] ).  Schwab-Zel’dovich  variables  for  mass  fractions  of 
gas and droplets and temperature are solved. Only the distinguish- 
ing features of these models and important results are discussed 
here and the detailed equations could be found in the relevant ref- 
erences. Typically, a vaporization Damköhler number ( Da vap ) is in- 
troduced for which, the large values indicate a highly volatile fuel 
or small droplets [411] . 

Using the methodology described above, Kunin et al. [357] de- 
veloped a ﬁrst-generation model of gel propellant spray ﬂames and 
compared the combustion characteristics of gelled and nongelled 
fuels. The model considers far-ﬁeld region of the over-ventilated 
laminar  ﬂame  so  that  interactions  between  the  droplet  and  co- 
ﬂowing air stream can be ignored and relative velocity between 
them  can  be  taken  to  be  zero.  Model  equations  utilized  vapor- 
ization  Damköhler  number  ( Da vap )  to  model  the  oscillatory  va- 
porization of the organic gel fuel droplet described previously in 
Section 6.4 (also see Section 6.4.4 ). A continuously varying cosine 
function was provided as in Eq. (49) .

ηa  is the axial coordinate and η

ﬂ is the axial ﬂame front lo- 
cation. Since the oscillatory vaporization was assumed to trigger 
at the ﬂame surface, experimental observations of constant Da vap,0 
upstream of the ﬂame surface were utilized to specify Da vap  os- 
cillations in the downstrem region of the homogeneous diffusion 
ﬂame. Temporal oscillations in the vaporization rate of a droplet 
moving through the hot carrier gas are transformed into spatial os- 
cillations of Da vap . Kunin et al. [357] simpliﬁed the multi-sectional 
approach  by  adopting  mono-sectional  droplets.  Fig.  155  summa- 
rizes the key predictions of this model for a given gel fuel loading 
( δ

Fig. 155 a shows that the height of homogeneous diffusion ﬂame 
measured in terms of the axial coordinate ηa  decreases dramat-

ically as the frequency of oscillatory vaporization ( f vap ) increases, 
with attendant changes in the shape of ﬂame front. This affects the 
consumption of droplets as seen from the mass fraction of liquid 
phase ( γ
d ) in the axial direction (plotted for a ﬁxed transverse co- 
ordinate ξ t ) in Fig. 155 b. The ﬂuctuations at higher f vap occur since 
the oscillatory vaporization is characterized by non-uniform vapor- 
ization rates. Hot spots appear due to the heterogeneous droplets 
burning separately from the main ﬂame along with the reduction 
in the homogeneous ﬂame temperature, as shown in Fig. 155 c. Hot 
core of the homogeneous ﬂame also shrinks at higher frequency. 

A feature of the model [357] , shared by all the subsequent stud- 
ies, is the device of considering oscillatory vaporization once the 
gel  droplet  crosses  the  homogeneous  diffusion  ﬂame  front.  The 
problem can thus be analyzed by considering oscillatory vaporiza- 
tion  effects  in  the  downstream  and  ﬂame  properties  in  the  up- 
stream. 

Subsequent  studies  added  more  realism  and  expanded  the 
scope  of  predictions  closer  to  realistic  laboratory  ﬂames  in  the 
form of discontinuous oscillatory vaporization [358] , droplet drag 
[351] ,  droplet  polydispersity  [360] ,  temperature-dependent  fre- 
quency of oscillating vaporization [ 359 , 360 ], Lewis number ( Le ) ef- 
fects [360] , size-dependent Da vap [25] , and Peclet number ( Pe ) ef- 
fects due to the transverse diffusion of oxidizer and heat [365] . We 
discuss important results of these studies in the following. Further, 
recent effort s have f ocused on premixed laminar ﬂames [376] and 
we discuss them in Section 6.8.6 . 

A  more  realistic  picture  of  vaporization  is  achieved  by  dis- 
continuous  changes  in  Da vap  [358]  in  ηa -direction.  Kunin  et  al. 
[358] accordingly improved the previous model [357] after replac- 
ing Eq. (49) by Eq. (50) .

q  denotes  the  ’single  period  of  no  evaporation  followed  by  a 
spurt  of  evaporation’  [358] ,  q 1  is  the  ’period  of  no  evaporation’, 
and H is the Heaviside function. In practice, droplets are not neces- 
sarily in the dynamic equilibrium with their carrier gas and move 
with a different velocity. They could also be ballistic and move at 
steep angles to the main axis of the ﬂow, conditions which lead 
to a ﬁnite drag. Kunin et al. [ 357 , 358 ] did not consider the drag 
on droplets. Greenberg [351] improved their predictions by adding 
the effects of droplet drag on the height of homogeneous diffusion 
ﬂame  and  propensity  of  the  hot  spots  downstream  of  the  main 
ﬂame front, this time using a modiﬁed continuous oscillating va- 
porization function given in Eq. (51) .

d,0 .  Fig.  156 

As shown in Figs. 156 a and 156 c, droplets moving slower than 
the surrounding ﬂuid resulted in taller ﬂame over that of droplets 
in dynamic equilibrium (described by Kunin et al. [ 357 , 358 ]) and 
reduced the hot spots. Smaller drag coeﬃcient ( C 
d,l ) also increased 
the ﬂame height as shown in Fig. 156 b. These effects are attributed 
to the longer residence time of droplets. The drag and slower ve- 
locity of droplets increase the residence time of droplets in the ho- 
mogeneous  diffusion  ﬂame  region,  leading  to  an  increase  in  the 
height  of  homogeneous  diffusion  ﬂame  due  to  improved  vapor- 
ization [351] . Reduction in the available vapor in the downstream 
also eliminated the hot spots formed due to oscillatory vaporiza- 
tion and heterogeneous burning of the droplets. 

Kunin et al. [25] showed that the ﬂame shape was affected by 
initial droplet load ( δ
gel ), small droplet load broadened the ﬂame 
base due to instant availability of fuel vapor. Bigger load reduced 
the ﬂame temperature, height, and size of hot core on one hand

and eliminated the hot spots on the other hand. Eq. (49) afforded 
the  prediction  of  frequency  effects  to  show  that  the  higher  fre- 
quency decreased the ﬂame height, caused a slow and stepped de- 
crease in fuel concentration (similar to Fig. 155 b), and enabled the 
hot spots. The exponential decrease in fuel concentration at low 
oscillation frequencies (see Fig. 155 b, f vap = π ) is also observed in 
the analytical approximation of fuel concentration function γ
d (see 

Eq. (10) in Ref. [25] ), in which the higher-order effects of oscilla- 
tions are neglected.

In  Eq.  (53) ,  D  is  the  diffusion  coeﬃcient,  E  is  the  vaporiza-

are the dimensions of the largest and smallest droplets in a sec- 
tion,  respectively.  Numerical  solutions  are  necessary  when  using 
Eqs. (52) and (53) . 

Kunin et al. [360] individually analyzed the multiple effects and 
their  results  suggest  that  temperature-dependent  frequency  (see 
Eqs. (8a) and (8b) in Kunin et al. [360] ) does not affect the hot 
spots and non-unity Lewis number mildly adjusts them. Greenberg 
et al. [359] have considered the effects of temperature-dependent 
frequency in more details, suggesting that the trends qualitatively 
match with the constant f vap results of previous models. 

All  the  results  described  above  restrict  to  the  streamwise 
changes  in  accordance  with  the  original  formulation  of  Burke- 
Schumann ﬂame with droplets [404] . Kunin et al. [365] relaxed this 
restriction and thereby introduced the Peclet number ( Pe = vR / D ), 
where v is velocity of gas. The diffusion terms were of the form 
( 1 / P e 2 ) ∂ 2 var / ∂ η2 where var ≡ γ and γ T . Large Pe reduces the resi- 
dence time of droplets in the pre-ﬂame region and hence increases 
the likelihood of droplet-generated hot spots in the downstream. 
Flame height also increases with Pe , peaks at Pe = 2, continuously 
decreases  in  the  range  Pe = 2-10,  and  approaches  an  asymptotic 
value thereafter, albeit slowly. 

6.8.3. Gel fuels: experiments 

Experiments on the canonical laboratory gel spray ﬂames have 
been rarely reported. Padwal and Mishra [56] conducted experi- 
ments on turbulent non-premixed ﬂames of Jet A1 gel fuel and air. 
They used a specially designed two-ﬂuid atomizer [ 49 , 52 ] for ob- 
taining the sprays. Their objectives were to demonstrate the end- 
to-end  application  of  the  two-ﬂuid  internally  impinging  jet  at- 
omizer,  extract  information  on  gel  fuel  ﬂame  stabilization,  cata- 
logue ﬂame regimes, visualization of ﬂames using line-of-sight CH ∗
chemiluminescence imaging, and comparison of the properties of 
gelled and nongelled Jet A1 spray ﬂames. To fulﬁll these objectives, 
a bluff body burner, which used the atomizer face as a bluff body, 
was designed and ﬂames were successfully stabilized with or with- 
out swirl imparted to the combustion air [56] . Parametric studies 
using GLR , combustion air-fuel mass ratio ( A/F ), and thermal out- 
put were reported. Fig. 157 shows the different regimes of spray 
ﬂames. 

The  type  of  fuel  itself  does  not  necessarily  affect  the  ﬂame 
regimes shown in Fig. 157 . Instead, an important aspect of these 
studies is that some features of the gel fuel spray ﬂames are sim- 
ilar to those commonly observed in bluff body stabilized ﬂames 
(see  for  example  Masri  and  Bilger  [430] )  and  seem  to  be  af- 
fected more by the burner characteristics than the fuel properties. 
Thus,  anchored  ﬂames  of  Jet  A1  gel  fuel  also  exhibited  a  lumi- 
nous base, a bluish neck, and luminous jet-like propagation zone 
[56]  as  shown  in  Fig.  157 a.  Non-swirling  ﬂame  operated  in  the 
stable anchored ( Fig. 157 a), partial blow-off ( Fig. 157 b), and neck 
blow-off ( Fig. 157 c) regimes. Swirling spray ﬂames exhibited stable 
( Figs. 157 d and 157 e), oscillating ( Fig. 157 f), and lifted ( Fig. 157 g) 
regimes.  Non-swirling  ﬂame  was  taller  and  symmetric  as  com- 
pared to the swirling ﬂames, while the lifted swirling ﬂame was 
compact and symmetric. 

It was also observed that the ﬂame in the lifted ﬂame regime 
could be affected by double ﬂame structure and continuation of 
the external sheath combustion regime, or transition into the ex- 
ternal group combustion regime [56] . 

The ﬂame stability limits were mapped using parametric vari- 
ations  of  swirl  number  ( S N ),  combustion  air-fuel  ratio  ( A/F ),  and 
GLR .  Resulting  stability  maps  are  shown  in  Fig.  158  along  with 
a  sketch  of  the  bluff body  assisted  burner.  The  oscillating  ﬂame 
regime  found  in  Fig.  158 b  is  accessible  under  the  conditions  of 
high A/F and S N . It involves a dynamic ﬂame transition between 
the lifted off and anchored ﬂame regimes [56] . Moreover, the lifted 
ﬂame was found to be remarkably stable and accessible irrespec- 
tive of the direction in which a parameter was varied, attesting to 
the repeatability of these experiments. 

Recently,  laboratory-scale  spray  ﬂames  of  kerosene  (99-77  %) 
gelled with 1-5 % polyamide resin, and containing 0-25 % micro- 
B  (particle  size  ∼5  μm)  or  0-20  %  micro-Al  (particle  size  ∼5- 
100 μm) were stabilized on a coﬂow burner. The gel fuels were 
sprayed vertically upward with the help of a commercial two-ﬂuid 
atomizer in a vitiated ambient atmosphere composed of combus- 
2 -air premixed ﬂame stabilized upstream of 
4 -O 
tion products of CH 
2 was such that the viti- 
the spray injection point. Enrichment by O 
ated atmosphere contained 21 % (v/v) O 
2 . Spray ﬂames of B-loaded 
and Al-loaded gel fuels were stabilized using the above arrange- 
ment, although ﬂame characterization has not been reported. 

6.8.4. Comparison of Jet A1 gel and Jet A1 spray ﬂames 

Padwal and Mishra [56] compared the spray ﬂames of Jet A1- 
Thixatrol ST -xylene gel fuel with Jet A1 at the same nominal ther- 
mal output to investigate and describe the differences between a 
gel and base liquid fuel spray ﬂames. Both the fuels have similar

caloriﬁc value and stoichiometric air-fuel ratio [56] . Their combus- 
tion is visually compared in Fig. 159 . 

As  shown  in  Figs.  159 a  and  159 b,  spray  ﬂames  of  both  fuels 
are wide in appearance, with a stable ﬂame anchored at the base 
of the burner. This feature is controlled by the ﬂow ﬁeld and less 
by the type of fuel. However, the ﬂames differ in terms of natural 
luminosity. In general, Jet A1 gel ﬂames are more luminous at the 
base and neck than Jet A1 ﬂames [56] . Major heat release region is 
located in the jet-like propagation zone for both ﬂames as shown 
in Figs. 159 c and 159 d since it contains the fuel vapors from the 
largest ballistic droplets of spray [56] . 

Besides this, the normalized intensity of continuous emission 
due to soot is also maximized in this region and it is slightly more 
in case of gel Jet A1 spray ﬂames [56] , as shown in Figs. 159 e and 
159 f. The heat release region is more widely distributed in Jet A1, 
and in comparison to the Jet A1 gel ﬂame, signiﬁcant heat release 
occurs in the neck of Jet A1 ﬂame due to the combined effect of 
intense turbulence and a smaller droplet size [56] . 

Spray ﬂames of Jet A1 gel are shorter than Jet A1 spray ﬂames, 
irrespective of the stabilization method, as shown in the table ac- 
companying Fig. 160 . A number of competing factors identiﬁed by 
Padwal and Mishra [56] are responsible for this difference in the 

127 

M.B. Padwal, B. Natan and D.P. Mishra 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 83 (2021) 100885 

ﬂame height of Jet A1 gel spray. These factors respectively enhance 
the heat transfer to droplet, promote fuel-lean combustion, could 
increase the vaporization rate of the gel propellant droplets, and 
balance the adverse effect of a larger droplet size [56] . 

As discussed in Section 6.8.2 , theoretical studies have already 
shown that the oscillatory vaporization could introduce variations 
in the ﬂame height for laminar diffusion spray ﬂames of gel fuels 
utilizing organic gellants, in which case it is shown to decrease the 
height of homogeneous diffusion ﬂame. In any case, it is clear that 
the ultimate causes of the difference in the visible heights of Jet A1 
and Jet A1 gel spray ﬂames could be found in the gellant properties 
and rheological nature of the gel fuel. 

The spray ﬂames of gel fuel liquid fuels studied by Padwal and 
Mishra [56] achieved almost complete combustion and the reduc- 
tion in the visible ﬂame height should not be construed as a sign 
of incomplete combustion in the Jet A1 gel fuel spray ﬂames. Since 
the additional factors that could affect the ﬂame height were also 
identiﬁed in above experiments, they should prove helpful for de- 
tailed experiments in future and support the modeling effort s in 
order  to  obtain  reliable  models  of  spray  combustion  of  gel  pro- 
pellants. Apart from these experiments on gel fuel non-premixed 
spray ﬂames containing organic gellants, experiments considering 
the ﬂames with polymeric gellants and inorganic particulate gel- 
lants have not been reported. 

Predictive models discussed in Section 6.8.2 have also unrav- 
eled the differences between gel and liquid fuel spray ﬂames. As 
an example, the predictions of Ref. [358] in Fig. 161 for laminar 2D 
diffusion ﬂames using the burner of Fig. 161 a, show the decrease in 
the height of homogeneous diffusion ﬂame due to the oscillatory 
vaporization of gel droplets in Fig. 161 b. Corresponding increase in 
the concentration of droplets downstream of the ﬂame is predicted 
when the gel fuel spray is combusted, as shown in Fig. 161 c. Con- 
tours of the oxidizer mass fraction indicate that the hot spots of lo- 
cally intense combustion pockets would form as shown in Fig. 161 d 
when the liquid is substituted by a gel fuel. 

Reduced height of the main diffusion ﬂame is further illustrated 
by plotting the percentage reduction in the height of gel fuel ho-

spray ﬂames of Jet A1-Thixatrol ST-xylene gel fuel. Based on the experimental data 
and scheme proposed in Ref. [56] . 

visible ﬂame height. These factors were identiﬁed using the exper- 
imental results on atomization [52] and combustion of Jet A1 gels 
[56] conducted by these authors. The proposed scheme [56] could 
be represented in Fig. 160 . 

Accordingly,  under  the  comparable  operating  conditions  (see 
Table  2 ,  Ref.  [56] ),  larger  mean  droplet  size  of  Jet  A1  gel  spray 
tends to increase the visible ﬂame height ( H 
ﬂ). However, increased 
aromatic content of the carrier solvent (xylene), increased oxygen 
content present in the organic gellant, and oscillatory vaporization 
(induced by a highly viscous and porous gellant layer of the het- 
erogeneous gel propellant droplet [54] ) tend to reduce the visible

mogeneous diffusion ﬂame over that of liquid fuel in Fig. 162 . The 
model in Ref. [25] predicts that height of gel fuel diffusion ﬂame 
can decrease drastically when the frequency of oscillatory vapor- 
ization expressed in terms of Da vap is in a certain range. The height 
also depends upon the initial fraction of fuel in the spray jet. The 
reduction in ﬂame height pertains only to the homogeneous dif- 
fusion ﬂame at the base of atomizer. The possibility of hot spots 
forming downstream of the homogeneous core is not considered 
in the ﬂame height reported in Fig. 162 . 

Kunin et al. [25] showed that liquid and gel fuel spray ﬂames 
differed  in  a  narrow  range  of  Da vap,0 = 6-9.  Greenberg  et  al. 
[376] recently showed that this effect is speciﬁc to the diffusion 
ﬂames. 

6.8.5. Extended Burke-Schumann analysis: spray properties 

Kunin et al. [360] analyzed the effects of size distributions of 
droplets on the behavior of laminar spray diffusion ﬂames of gel 
fuel. The polydispersity of the sprays was modeled using nine sec- 
tions and a size range of 1-110 μm. Distributions having the same 
D 32 = 44.8 μm  signiﬁcantly  altered  the  ﬂame  and  the  hot  spots. 
Fig. 163 shows these effects using the ﬂame shape-height data and 
isotherms for three distributions. 

Among  the  droplet  size  distributions  used,  dist-1  is  ‘quasi- 
monodisperse’, dist-2 is bimodal with a much larger fraction of the 
largest section, and dist-3 is polydisperse with droplets of all size 
classes. It is observed from Fig. 163 a that the ﬂame heights are not 
affected by a change in the distribution function although signif- 
icant changes in the ﬂame shapes occurred. Bimodal distribution 
( dist-2 ) produced a narrow ﬂame front in the ξ t -direction, accom- 
panied by hot spots as shown in Fig. 163 c, clearly due to the larger 
fraction of the largest droplet size. 

6.8.6. Organic gel fuel premixed spray ﬂames 

Greenberg et al. [376] recently extended the phenomenological 
modeling approach developed for diffusion ﬂames [ 351 , 357 , 358 ] to 
a fuel-rich curved laminar premixed ﬂame of gel fuel. At present, 
only the mono-sectional limit of essentially multi-sectional spray 
has been treated. The classical constant density reaction-diffusion 
framework (see Kagan and Sivashinsky [431] ) was employed to de- 
scribe the ﬂow, thermal, and reaction ﬁelds of gel fuel spray pre- 
mixed with a diluted oxidizer. Continuous cosine oscillatory vapor- 
ization effects were prescribed similar to Eq. (49) , again using a 
predeﬁned temperature for their onset ( T osc ) as per the experimen- 
tal observations.

Fig. 163.  Effects of the polydispersity of gel fuel sprays on the laminar diffusion 
spray ﬂames of gel fuel in terms of (a) homogeneous ﬂame shape and height and 
(b)-(d) isotherms. Vaporization constant E = 35 × 10 3 
, f vap = 6 π , δgel = 0.9. Adopted 
from Ref. [360] . 

Fig. 164 a shows the ﬂame stability curve in terms of the ﬂame 
propagation velocity ( V prop ) and the foregoing frequency of oscil- 
latory vaporization ( f vap ), in which an unstable ﬂame is predicted 
as f vap → 0 and a constant propagation velocity for f vap → ∞ . The un- 
stable ﬂame typically propagates in an oscillatory fashion following 
the oscillatory vaporization in the low- f vap region although it is not 
apparent in the magnitude of V prop from Fig. 164 a. 

The  two  regimes  are  represented  by  f vap = 0.01  and  5  in 
Fig. 164 b, which clearly shows the oscillatory nature of vaporiza- 
tion  getting  reﬂected  in  the  concentration  of  gel  fuel  in  liquid 
phase for f vap = 0.01. Corresponding temperature proﬁles show that 
the oscillatory vaporization effects are suppressed in the thermal 
ﬁeld of the ﬂame; unlike the prominent spikes predicted for the 
diffusion ﬂames (see Section 6.8.2 , Figs. 155 and 156 ). 

In other words, unlike the diffusion ﬂames, the hot spots are 
suppressed  in  the  premixed  laminar  ﬂame  at  least  under  the 
fuel-rich conditions. Computations of Greenberg et  al.  [376] also 
yielded neutral stability curves  in T osc -Da vap  and f vap -Da vap  coor- 
dinate  spaces  as  illustrated  in  Figs.  164 c  and  164 d.  In  particu- 
lar, Fig. 164 c shows that steady ﬂame propagation commences as 
the temperature for initiating oscillation ( T osc ) is reduced. Further, 
Fig.  164 d  shows  that  steady  ﬂame  propagation  is  possible  once 
f vap ≥ 0.225. 

Greenberg et al. [376] suggest that the usual competition be- 
tween the heat loss due to vaporization and heat release in the 
ﬂame  considered  to  induce  unsteadiness  is  suppressed  by  gel 
droplets in the fuel-rich laminar premixed spray ﬂames. 

6.9. Combustion of gel propellants in rocket engines 

Combustion of gel propellants (especially metalized gel propel- 
lants) in rocket motors is their ultimate application. Many studies 
have considered this topic and signiﬁcant data on the actual per- 
formance of these propellants have been generated via static high- 
pressure combustion  tests,  mostly  in the  instrumented  sub-scale 
rocket motors. Many complexities limiting the performance of gel 
propellants have been encountered in such tests. They indicate the 
departure  from  the  ideal  behavior  of  gel  propellants  as  demon- 
strated  by  Haddad  et  al.  [37] .  Previous  experience  with  the  use

115 , 432-434 ]. 

Highly loaded metal slurries stabilized by gellants have already 
been extensively studied [ 60 , 66 , 383 , 392 , 435 ] for ramjet and after- 
burner applications. In this respect, a few slurry fuel formulations 
based on B are also noteworthy [ 398 , 399 ]. Luo et al. [392] used 
JP-10 slurry of 16 wt % nano-Al (30-50 nm) and stabilized by 2 
wt % oleic acid for combustion with oxygen in an uncooled com- 
bustor ( O/F = 1.7-1.9). Swirl coaxial injector was used for atomiza- 
tion  of  the  slurry  fuel  of  relatively  low  metal  loading.  They  ex- 
perimented  with  water  injection  during  combustion  to  improve 
the  stability  and  increase  thrust.  The  downside  was  reduction 
in  the  speciﬁc  impulse  and  combustion  eﬃciency.  Incorporation 
of  metal  resulted  in  higher  combustion  eﬃciency  while  it  was 
noted that the reduction in two-phase losses improved the speciﬁc 
impulse. 

Mueller and Turns [ 325 , 328-330 , 385 ] have extensively studied 
the combustion of RP-1 slurry with 60 % Al, treating the Al parti- 
cles as pseudo-gellants and focusing on the droplet and spray com- 
bustion. They particularly emphasized on the secondary atomiza- 
tion of large (20 0-10 0 0 μm) and small (20-100 μm) metal slurry 
droplets by shell disruption for aiding the ignition and combustion 
of Al agglomerates within the available residence time in the com- 
bustion chamber [385] . 

In this section, we begin with the theoretical performance of 
gel propellants and assess their strengths and weakness vis-à-vis 
liquid propellants, with emphasis on metalized gels. High-pressure 
combustion of gel monopropellants is then discussed. Some impor- 
tant results on heat transfer in gel propellant rocket engines are 
considered next. It is followed by a summary of metalized gel fuel 
formulations and performance parameters derived from static ﬁr- 
ings at the sub-scale. Some issues concerned with the scalability 
of gel propellant engines are considered at the end.

6.9.1. Theoretical analysis 

In this section, we review the available reports detailing the ef- 
fects of gelation on the theoretical performance of liquid propel- 
lants. The performance is described primarily in terms of the spe- 
ciﬁc impulse ( I sp ) and effects of gellant concentration ( Y G ), metal 
loading  ( Y M ),  oxidizer-fuel  ratio  ( O/F ),  equivalence  ratio  ( φ),  and 
chamber  pressure  ( P C ).  Theoretical  analysis  evaluates  the  perfor- 
mance of potential propellants in rocket engines using some form 
of chemical equilibrium and thermodynamic states of the reactants 
and products. The essential computations of the states and many 
performance  parameters  are  performed  on  non-linear  equations. 
Many applications have been developed for this speciﬁc purpose, 
the one by McBride and Gordon [436] being a well-known exam- 
ple.

A feasibility study on the use of metalized gel fuels in the boost 
stage was carried out  [356] so that a solid rocket  booster  (SRB) 
could  be  replaced  by  a  liquid  rocket  booster  (LRB).  This  possi- 
bility rests on the premise that increase in propellant density or 
I sp ,  or  both  would  allow  increase  of  the  payload  capacity  or  re- 
duction  in  the  lift-off weight  [356] .  Among  the  many  metalized 
gel propellants considered in this study (MMH/N 
4 /Al, Aerozine- 
2 /Al, RP-1/O 
50/N 
2 /Al), we discuss some results ob- 
2 /LO 
tained using RP-1/O 
2 metalized with Al. The LRB would be attrac- 
tive only if it could be ﬁtted within the same volume as a con- 
ventional  SRB  after  accounting  for  any  losses.  It  was  found  that 
pressure-fed gel propellants were not attractive in this sense, even 
with a high metal loading ( Y

Al would probably be a good option although Y

Fig. 165 a. An increase in the payload by 14-37 % was considered 
feasible with metalized RP-1/O 
2  gel propellants under these con- 
ditions. LRB is supposed to suffer from penalties in the form of a 
diminished speciﬁc impulse eﬃciency ( ηI sp ), as shown in Fig. 165 b.

Fig.  167  presents  the  analysis  of  a  UDMH-Al  gel  propellant 
and ungelled nitrogen tetroxide (N 
4 ) under equilibrium condi- 
tions. UDMH was gelled using MC and silicone and metalized us- 
ing propellant-grade micro-Al powder (particle size ∼15 μm) [93] . 
The performance of gel propellant is represented in Fig. 167 a in 
Al - O/F coordinate space for P C / P e = 70 and area ratio, AR = 10. 
the Y 
Gelation clearly improves the speciﬁc impulse up to certain Y 
Al de- 
termined by O/F , as in Fig. 167 a. The AR values simulate different 
stages of a practical launch vehicle using liquid engines [438] and 
performance gain is expected at higher AR , as in Fig. 167 b. Fig. 167 c 
also reveals that the effect of chamber pressure ( P C ) on I sp is likely 
to be negligible. 

A practical beneﬁt of improvement in I sp and propellant density 
(achieved by gelation of Al) is in terms of the higher payload ca- 
pacity. It is predicted that the payload capacity would increase by 
20 % for the polar satellite launch vehicle [438] fueled with UDMH- 
Al  gel  propellant.  However,  above  theoretical  estimates  are  still 
optimistic because they do not account for many competing fac- 
tors affecting the overall performance. Gellants inevitably degrade 
the performance because, barring a very few examples [ 9 , 85 , 86 ], 
virtually  all  gellants  are  poor  substitutes  for  energetic  materials. 
Only a signiﬁcant amount of metalization could improve the I sp - 
performance adequately. A second complicating factor inﬂuencing 
the application of gel propellants in liquid rocket engines is the 
feasibility of using a given gel propellant formulation. It turns out 
that the optimal gel propellant formulation is not necessarily the 
one with the best (maximum) performance ( I sp ). Results of Rahimi 
et al. [26] illustrate this issue for MMH-IRFNA gelled hypergols. 

As shown in Fig. 168 , the feasible region of performance is lim- 
ited  by  the  gellant  concentrations  (HPC  for  MMH  and  silica  for 
IRFNA) such that a fragile gel propellant formulation would have 
to be chosen to enhance I sp . 

Thus,  the  stability  of  gel  would  have  to  be  sacriﬁced  during 
the search for an optimal gel propellant formulation. In any case, 
Fig. 168 reveals that less energetic or inert gellants would invari- 
ably degrade the performance. 

In  another  example  of  novel  gel  propellants,  Boyer  et  al. 
[121]  used  two  monopropellants  to  form  a  gel  bipropellant.  The 
fuel  contained  ethyl  ammonium  nitrate  (EAN)  and  aq.  ammo- 
nium  nitrate  (AN)  gelled  with  nano-boron  (amorphous  powder, 
< 150  nm).  Oxidizer  was  a  mixture  of  hydrogen  peroxide  and 
aq.  ammonium nitrate called PERSOL  1 with the composition of 
2 O = 38:46:16 [121] . The goal was to obtain a fuel-rich 
H 
gel. The performance data shown in Fig. 169 was obtained by vary- 
ing Y B (0-30 %) and maintaining a ﬁxed ratio of other components 
of the gel.

A signiﬁcant increase in the performance is predicted with in-

However, an increase in the propellant density is also likely to off-

Except for the better performance of MMH/N 

4 /Al gel propel- 
lant, the remaining metalized gel propellants are less likely to be 
useful for LRB application. In another feasibility study, Palaszewski 
and Rapp [437] obtained the projections for Mars mission using 
the  same  metalized  gel  propellants  as  discussed  above.  It  was 
noted that RP-1/O 
4 suffered from low combustion 
2 O 
temperature while LH 
2 would not ﬁt economically in the avail- 
able  tank  volumes  [437] .  Starkovich  et  al.  [85]  have  shown  that 
methane (or ethane) particles could be used as gellants to improve 
2  and gain a small improvement in I sp  (by 4 s) 
the density of LH 
2 system at Y G = 5 %. Small penalty in I sp 
in comparison to LH 
would be incurred for Y G = 70 %.

radiative heat transfer from oxide particles to the chamber walls. 
The resulting estimates are shown in Fig. 166 .

cause ∼1 % loss in I sp . The losses in I sp are considered to be severe 
and could also eliminate the beneﬁts of payload increase [325] . The 
ηI sp was estimated at 94.6 % for Y 
Al = 60 % after accounting for the 
radiation and two-phase losses incurred during Al combustion.

suitable for maintaining low enough the viscosity for pumping. For 
Y B  > 15 %, best performance could be obtained at O/F ∼0.3-0.6. 
Moreover, the performance curves seem to reach a plateau so that 
a wider range of O/F could give similar performance. Such perfor- 
mance characteristics enable deep throttling and operation at off- 
design points [121] . Apart from the performance and pumping re- 
quirements, further optimization of the propellant formulation was 
achieved by consideration of low freezing point and high propel- 
lant density for upper stage application and the optimally balanced

%. In all cases, the performance curves follow a plateau for some 
values of Y M (25-40 % for Al, 35-45 % for Al/Mg, and 20-30 % for 
Si) and it is recommended to use smaller metal loadings to reduce 
the two-phase losses incurred due to the presence of solid oxide 
particles in the exhaust [123] . 

Al/Mg = 40 %. For Si, it was 272.2 s at Y 

Possibility  of  combining  a  ramjet  with  B-loaded  gel  was  ex- 
plored  theoretically  by  Haddad  et  al.  [37] .  With  reference  to 
Fig.  171 a,  the  proposal  [140]  uses  an  aft  burner  ( 2 )  for  mixing 
and further combusting the fuel-rich products of a main burner ( 1 ) 
with the help of bypass air (BA). The main burner ( 1 ) would use 
boron loaded gel propellant. An important feature of this arrange- 
ment is the cooling of fuel-rich products to condense boron oxide 
and release heat [140] . The main elements and ﬂow paths are as 
sketched in Fig. 171 a. 

In  the  analysis,  a  Jet  A1-organic  gellant  propellant  was  com- 
pared with Jet A1-organic gellant / B (60:40) metalized gel pro- 
pellant.  Atmospheric  air  at  670  K  was  used  as  oxidizer  and 
P C = 1.2  MPa  was  speciﬁed.  Temperature  reached  at  the  end  of 
ﬁrst stage combustion in the main burner are shown in Fig. 171 b 
and  mole  fractions  ( X )  of  boron  species  are  shown  in  Fig.  171 c. 
Higher stage temperatures are reached when boron is suspended 
in  the  Jet  A1  gel  propellant  ( ● in  Fig.  171 b).  Fig.  171 c  shows

in  Fig.  171 c)  in  the  gas  phase  is  maximum  (except  HBO)  and  it 
could  be  used  as  a  working  condition  for  the  ﬁrst  stage.  Corre- 
sponding temperature for boron loaded gel propellant is 2220 K 
(compared to 1830 K of the gel propellant). In the second stage, 
3 (g) was achieved by mixing of hot com- 
the condensation of B 
bustion products of the ﬁrst stage with the cold bypass air (BA) 
with a concomitant decrease in the mixture temperature shown in 
Fig. 171 d as a function of bypass ratio ( BR ). Working condition for 
the second stage would be expressed in terms of the BR for which 
2 O 
the temperature would be lower than the boiling point of B 
3 
and high enough for good performance (marked by × in Fig. 171 d 
ﬁnal ∼20 0 0 K, overall f/a = 0.04, and φ = 0.5). The two- 
at BR = 3; T 
stage combustion with B-loaded gel propellant gives a higher ﬁ- 
nal temperature than gel propellant and also when compared with 
single-stage combustion [37] . Overall performance of the two-stage 
ramjet engine is shown in Fig. 171 e for f/a = 0.04, BR = 3, P C = 1.2 
MPa, and T CA = 670 K assuming ideal conditions. Speciﬁc impulse 
( I sp ) and thrust speciﬁc fuel consumption ( TSFC ) trends show the 
improvements gained by the use of boron loading in the gel pro- 
pellant.  Balas  and  Natan  [366]  considered  three  models  for  the

the initial chamber temperature is raised to 40 °C. The effect is 
less signiﬁcant for higher P C . 

Degassing  is  one  of  the  stages  in  propellant  formulation  and 
storage. It could alter the composition and uniformity of the pro- 
pellant. Hence, the effect of degassing time on the  ˙ r 
comb was inves- 
tigated using glass tubes, as shown in Fig. 173 b. Longer degassing 
(up to 12 h) resulted in enhanced  ˙ r 
comb along with scatter, appar- 
ently due to the removal of water content.

low feeding rates and hence, hardly any possibility of ﬂashback un- 
der the actually used injection velocities and pressure drop would 
exist [121] .

Weiser  et  al.  [440]  formulated  gel  monopropellants  of  ni- 
tromethane (CH 
2 , NM). Among the gels, gel-1 was a hybrid gel 
consisting of 5 % organic gellant and 5 % fumed silica while gel- 
2  contained  NM  gelled  with  10  %  organic  gellant.  High-pressure 
combustion was carried out in quartz glass tubes held in N 
2 atmo- 
sphere for which, P C = 0.3-1.2 MPa. NM and gel-2 ignited for P C ≥
0.8 MPa and gel-1 ignited for P C ≥ 0.3 MPa. The Vis-images of the 
combustion are shown in Fig. 174 for P C = 0.8 and 1.3 MPa. 

NM ﬂame weakly emits yellow-red colors and burns smoothly 
[440] . Flame of gel-1 burns similar to NM but also shows glow- 
ing residue of molten silica. Flame of gel-2 is sooty and emits a 
continuous yellow color above the regressing surface. Near-IR spec- 
tra were acquired during combustion and processed using ICT-BaM 
analysis [440] to produce the maximum and mean ﬂame temper- 
ature  data  shown  in  Fig.  175 .  Molten  silica  residue  did  not  af- 
fect the measurements and the contribution of H 
2 O was dominant. 
Fig. 175 shows that all three monopropellant ﬂames  show simi- 
lar mean ﬂame temperatures ( T mean ) in the range 190 0-20 0 0 K for 
P C = 0.8-1.3 MPa. For gel-1, T mean  decreased linearly to 1200 K at 
0.3 MPa probably due to incomplete combustion. Trends for T max 
are similar for the monopropellants and they are ∼200 K above 
T mean and ∼300 K below T

The levels of temperatures reached by ﬂames suggest that gel- 
lants (both inorganic and organic) do not seem to have signiﬁcantly 
affected the combustion kinetics. To verify this possibility, a de- 
tailed kinetic mechanism for combustion of NM consisting of 77 
species and 484 reactions was employed to obtain the results for 
time-histories of temperature and species mole fractions, as shown 
in Figs. 176 a and 176 b, respectively. The rise in temperature in two 
steps ( Fig. 176 a) was correlated to the reactions of CH

6.9.3. Heat transfer in gel propellant engines 

Combustion of metalized gel propellants is likely to alter ther- 
mal conditions inside the combustion chamber (CC) and the con- 
verging (C) and diverging (D) sections of the nozzle. Measurements 
of heat ﬂuxes ( ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) ) during combustion could furnish important in- 
formation on this issue. These measurements were conducted by 
Palaszewski  and  Zakany  [113]  using  a  highly  instrumented  sub- 
scale  tethered  motor  consisting  of  a  combustion  chamber  of  di- 
ameter 6.6 cm, length 15 cm, and a nozzle of throat diameter of 
1.5 cm. 31 cooling channels were installed on the exterior walls 
of the motor (22 on CC; nine on C and D) and instrumented with 
thermocouples and ﬂow meters for the estimation of heat ﬂuxes. 
Water was used as cooling medium. RP-1 gelled with 0-55 % Al

ameter of the mixing chamber of aft burner, injection conﬁgura- 
tions, cruise conditions, and particle characteristics were studied 
along with the conditions when condensation was not included. 
Recommendations on the design and operation of such ramjet en- 
gines with enhanced heat content were provided. Diskin and Natan 
[364] have reported the development of a computational model for 
the ﬂow ﬁeld of the B-loaded ramjet engine in which, the oscil- 
latory combustion of droplet is included along with ignition and 
combustion of boron particles and detailed multiphase interactions 
in  a  turbulent  ﬂow  ﬁeld.  The  conditions  inside  the  engine  were 
simulated  by  separate  injection  of  gel  droplets  and  boron  parti- 
cles.  This model  incorporates some  features of  the model  previ- 
ously used by Balas and Natan [366] . 

Apart  from  above  relatively  high-thrust  applications,  Moroni 
et al. [439] explored the use of gel propellants consisting of 94-88 
% kerosene, 4-5 % organic gellant, and 1-7 % uncoated/coated nano- 
(particle size ∼170, 280 nm) or micro-Al (particle size 7-15 μm). 
The intended use was for low-thrust applications (for instance atti- 
tude control) in conjunction with a resistojet to obtain an electric- 
chemical system. The metal loading was deliberately kept low to 
keep low viscosity and also satisfy the requirements of thrust, spe- 
ciﬁc impulse, and ignition [439] . However, theoretical performance 
of the metalized gels was not improved due to the low metal load- 
ings. 

6.9.2. High-pressure combustion of gel monopropellants 

A  small  number  of  investigations  have  focused  on  the  high- 
pressure combustion of gel monopropellants [ 121 , 123 , 440 ]. Wick- 
man [123] found that the combustion of Al and 80:20 Al/Mg gelled 
with LO 
2 using 2 % Cabosil proceeded without any detonation in 
cold cylinder combustion tests. The quenching occurred at the sub- 
mergence level. A dramatic increase in the linear rate of combus- 
tion ( ˙ r 
comb ) occurred when the heat sink was removed. Wickman 
noted that Al combustion was more pulsating compared to Al/Mg 
while no sparks or energetic burning were observed. Si combus- 
tion with LO

These proﬁles could be divided into three or four sections, as 
shown  in  Fig.  177 .  Section  ’0 (cid:3)  in  the  initial  region  of  CC  near 
the  plane  of  atomizer  is  prominently  found  in  gel  propellants 
( Figs.  177b-177d )  and  indicates  the  delay  in  combustion  due  to 
the  presence  of  gellant  and  Al.  Section  ’1 (cid:3)  is  the  zone  of  stabi- 
lized  combustion  and  nearly  constant  heat  ﬂux  along  the  longi- 
tudinal  axis  ( z )  of  the  combustion  chamber.  This  section  shifted 
downstream for gel propellants, as seen from Figs. 177b-177d . Sec- 
tion ’2 (cid:3) far downstream of the atomizer is located on the diverging 
section of nozzle and represents a region of steep fall in  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) due to 
deposition of solid particles on the walls of chamber and nozzle. 

The  heat  ﬂuxes  stabilized  in  the  combustion  section  (Section 
’1 (cid:3) ) for RP-1, as shown in Fig. 177 a and decreased substantially for 
gel propellants. Section ’3 (cid:3) indicates this region in Figs. 177b-177d . 
The fall in  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) is due to the deposition of solid particles on the walls 
of combustion chamber. Thus, distribution of heat ﬂuxes is differ- 
ent in gel propellant combustion, chieﬂy due to the presence of 
solid particles in the ﬂow. While local heat ﬂuxes increased due 
to the increase in radiation heat losses, deposition of solids altered 
their distribution. In all cases, the peak heat ﬂuxes ( ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) 
max ) occurred 
near the throat section. Peak heat ﬂuxes increased for gels as in- 
dicated on the ﬁgures. In another report, Palaszewski and Zakany 
[115] observed that the formation of a protective layer of gel on the 
surface of atomizer could effectively cool the atomizer and avoid 
damage. 

6.9.4. Metalized gel fuels 

Table 26 summarizes many compositions of metalized gel pro- 
pellants tested in static rocket motors, including the typical oper- 
ating conditions during the preparation of metalized gel propellant 
and other details related to the propellant properties. Results ob- 
tained on these gels are discussed subsequently. 

Entries in Table 26 suggest that the use of inorganic and or- 
ganic gellants has been considered, with signiﬁcant variations in 
the additives. Accordingly, Mordosky et al. [114] used surfactant to 
effectively de-agglomerate the nano-Al particles, while Negri and 
Ciezki [80] avoided its use. An important observation regarding the 

morphological features of highly loaded gel propellants was made 
by Mordosky et al. [114] . They found that gels using 55 % nano-Al 
behaved more like a slurry fuel and suffered from poor structural 
stability even in the presence of a surfactant. This has implications 
on the performance of rocket motors as discussed below. 

6.9.5. Performance evaluation 

Performance data of the laboratory-scale static test motors us- 
ing  different  combinations  of  gel  propellants  and  atomizers  are 
shown in Fig. 178 . Researchers at DLR [ 36 , 80 ] have considered the 
ramjet combustion of aluminized Jet A1-Thixatrol ST gel propellant 
at chamber pressures 0.6-1.1 MPa. Some of their results are pre- 
sented in Fig. 178 a and relevant operating conditions are given in 
Table 26 . Negri and Ciezki [80] found that substituting the micro- 
Al by nano-Al did not improve the performance and somewhat re- 
duced the combustion eﬃciency. Overall, the combustion eﬃciency 
of aluminized gels was less, only in the range 0.3-0.7 [ 36 , 80 ]. Com- 
pared with the results of Mordosky et al. [114] in Fig. 178 d, the 
possible reasons for the difference could be in the operating con- 
ditions, viz. low pressure, and dilution due to the presence of N 
2 
in air. Post-combustion microanalysis of the agglomerated particles 
by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spec- 
troscopy revealed a large fraction of non-oxidized Al (see Fig. 8 c). 
Phase separation of metal particles from the main gellant net- 
work resulted in their accumulation in the feed lines and injector 
passages [114] . Further, glowing metal particles were observed for 
Y G = 30 % and above [114] . Accumulation of the alumina layer and 
the presence of unburnt Al has been noted as a serious concern for 
the metalized gel propellant based motors [ 80 , 114 ], to the extent 
that Negri and Ciezki [80] observed that nano-Al failed to improve 
the combustion eﬃciency since approx. 50-70 % Al did not oxidize. 
Thus, signiﬁcant improvements are required in the understanding 
of combustion physics and aerodynamics of rocket motors used for 
highly loaded gel propellants. 

Mordosky et al. [114] used aluminized RP-1 propellant gelled 
with  fumed  silica  in  various  combinations.  Surfactant  Tween-85 
was  added  to  stabilize  the  nano-Al  particles  of  100  nm  size.

Their results indicate that relatively less stable gel RP-1 propellant 
loaded with a high Al mass fraction led to unusual behavior in the 
pressure histories. Tests with 55 wt % Al showed the presence of 
alumina layers in the rocket engine, erosion of nozzle and coaxial 
injectors. These deﬁciencies are due to the inhomogeneity of the 
gel propellant loaded with high mass fraction of aluminum, a sit- 
uation also veriﬁed by the observations of Negri and Ciezki [80] . 
Propellants loaded with high metal mass fractions are in fact more 
akin to the metalized slurry fuels and their aging is a known is- 
sue in the stability of slurry fuels. Mordosky et al. [114] also con- 
ducted a detailed statistical analysis of their data to understand the 
causes behind the observed scatter in the performance data. One of 
the outcomes of their analysis is the conclusion that RP-1 gel pro- 
pellants loaded with high mass fractions of nano-Al were at least 
as eﬃcient as RP-1 gel propellants ( Fig. 178 d, in conjunction with 
Fig. 178 b). This could be due to the combustion of nano-Al masking 
the effect of larger droplet sizes in the metalized gel propellants. 

Rahimi et al. [26] demonstrated the laboratory scale hypergolic 
spray  combustion  of  hydrazine  gel  fuel  with  IRFNA  gel  oxidizer. 
HEC and fumed silica were used as gellants for the fuel and ox- 
idizer, respectively. Additional details are mentioned in Table 26 . 
Theoretical analysis of the propellant performance and rheological 
measurements indicated a region of operational feasibility. Rheo- 
logical behavior of the gels during transport and impingement in- 
troduced uncertainty in the measurements of mass ﬂow rates, and 
thereby, O/F estimates. They found that the pentad injector would 
not  lead  to  hypergolic  ignition  in  unconﬁned  environment  over 
a wide O/F range but readily showed ignition and combustion in 
the conﬁnement of the chamber. Fig. 178 c shows the experimental 
data as a function of O/F . Performance of gel propellants dimin- 
ished in comparison to the base liquid hypergols and also suffered 
from a narrow range of O/F . The maximum c ∗ eﬃciency was ∼90 % 
for gel propellants compared to > 95 % for the base hypergols. The 
observed difference could be partly due to the rheological charac-

teristics. As expected, HEC gellant was consumed completely dur- 
ing combustion and silica left a thin layer on the walls. 

Ellison et al. [116] conducted a small static ﬁring study using 
2 . They adapted dou- 
gelled RP-1 and 16 % nano-Al and gaseous O 
2 -RP-1 
blet impinging jet injectors originally designed for liquid O 
gel system. Three injectors were placed near the sidewall of cham- 
ber in canted position. Half of gaseous O 
2 was used in atomization 
of the gel fuel and the rest was injected at the head end of motor. 
Mixing was improved by this arrangement. Based on the operating 
conditions given in Table 26 , the c ∗ eﬃciency was in the range 72- 
97 %. However, lack of adequate control over the uncertainties in 
fuel ﬂow rates resulted in signiﬁcant uncertainties in the estimates 
of eﬃciency in their case. 

Desyatkov et al. [109] have compared the combustion eﬃcien- 
cies in a ramjet-type combustion chamber for cases in which addi- 
tive hydrocarbons of higher vapor pressure were included in met- 
alized Jet A1 gels. No signiﬁcant improvements could be gained. 

Gafni  et  al.  [355]  conducted  hundreds  of  valid  ﬁrings  on  a 
110  mm  ramjet-type  laboratory-scale  combustor  using  metalized 
kerosene  gels  and  vitiated  ambient  air  ( T a = 712-1100  K).  Paraf- 
ﬁn  and  aluminum  tristearate  (ATS)-HTPB  were  used  as  gellants. 
Microscopic  Al  or  Ni  coated  Al  (Ni/Al)  particles  were  also  used. 
Kerosene-paraﬃn gels were structurally highly stable and paraﬃn 
also acts as a fuel. Their measurements and estimates of c ∗ based 
combustion eﬃciency ( η
c ∗ ), combustion temperature ( T ), and spe- 
ciﬁc impulse ( I sp ) are shown in Fig. 179 for seven compositions of 
gels, along with kerosene data for comparison. 

In these compositions, A0 and A1 are the non-metalized gels 
of ATS-HTPB and paraﬃn in the ratio (94.8:3.8:1.4) and (71.4:28.5), 
respectively. Compositions A3 and A4 are for kerosene-ATS-HTPB- 
Ni/Al gels in the ratios (89.5:3.6:1.3:5.6) and (84.7:3.4:1.3:10.6), re- 
spectively.  A5  and  A9  compositions  are  for  kerosene-paraﬃn-Al 
gels in the ratios (68:27.2:4.8) and (55:22:23), respectively. A7 is 
the optimal formulation of metalized gel fuel containing kerosene- 

paraﬃn-Ni/Al  in  the  ratio  (65:26:9).  The  gel  fuels  were  atom- 
ized using an industrial airblast atomizer. Chamber pressures ( P C ) 
reached during these tests were in the range 0.56-1.6 MPa. Most of 
the available data from these tests are included in Fig. 179 . 

As shown in Fig. 179 a, combustion eﬃciencies in the range 0.7- 
0.92 have been achieved in these tests and estimated I sp values are 
in the range 70 0-140 0 s, as shown in Fig. 179 b. I sp  ∼1400 s was 
achieved for non-metalized A1 gel and the optimal gel A7 yielded 
I sp = 1200 s. Further, T = 2000 K and η
c ∗ = 0.9 were achieved at φ
≈ 1.75 for A7. However, as shown in Fig. 179 b, Al did not enhance 
the engine performance [355] and the performance deteriorated at 
higher Al loadings. Possible increase in the residence time could 
improve density speciﬁc impulse although heat losses should be 
considered [355] . Bypass ratio ( BR ) ∼0.7 was adequate for work- 
ing  with  A7  gel.  In  fact,  the  optimal  BR  ∼0.7  was  observed  for 
almost all compositions [355] . It is illustrated in Fig. 179 c for A7 
gel. Fig. 179 d shows that the combustion temperatures reached by 
non-metalized gels (A0 and A1) are higher than the optimal gel 
A7, indicating that the combustion of Al particles might have been 
incomplete. In this respect, these results conﬁrm the previous ob- 
servations on Al combustion in gel fuels. 

Recently, Xiao et al. [441] conducted ramjet-type combustion of 
kerosene-polyamide resin-B (57-67:3:40-30) gels at the operating 
conditions representing an engine ﬂying at M = 3 at 10 km altitude. 
They achieved η
c ∗ in the range 0.9-0.96 with reduction noted for 
Y B = 0.4.  Thermal  eﬃciencies  in  the  range  0.8-0.9  were  achieved 
with lower value attributed to higher Y B . 

The compositions of hydrazine-HEC and IRFNA-silica gel hyper- 
gols optimized for 2-4 % HEC and 3-5 % silica [26] were utilized 
for combustion in a tethered laboratory-scale rocket engine pro- 
viding a nominal thrust of 0.1 kN and shown in Fig. 180 a. Some 
results on the performance of this system were discussed above 
(see Figs. 168 and 178 c). Multiple types of ﬁrings, including short- 
bursts of 5 s, continuous ﬁrings of 25 s, and multi-pulse (10 pulses,

The combustion of aluminized Jet A1-7.5 % Thixatrol ST-7.5 % 
MIAK gel propellants was investigated in a ramjet type combustor 
by Madlener et al. [169] . These combustion experiments were con- 
ducted along with droplet size measurements reported previously 
in  Section  5.8.3  (see  Fig.  97 )  using  the  same  atomizer  mounted

jectors and three gel monopropellants have been tested. Engineers 
at Bayern Chemie have successfully conducted long-duration tests 
( > 50-80 s) of proprietary gel propellants on a throttleable rocket 
motor [374] and have previously described the use of a pintle in-

[369] . 

Dove  et  al.  [442]  compared  the  time-varying  corrosion  rates 
of IRFNA and different gel compositions containing IRFNA during 
their storage in light-weight Al-alloy vessels. Multiple assessment 
methods used by them indicate that although gels reach same low 
corrosion rates with time as the liquid IRFNA (due to the formation 
of a passivating ﬁlm on the vessel walls [442] ), restricted mobility 
and/or reduced concentration of inhibitor P 
10 (0.5-3 %) delay the 
4 O 
approach towards low corrosion rates in gels. 

6.9.6. Scalability issues 

Experiments  on  the  scalability  of  gel  propellant  rocket  mo- 
tors  [33]  have  shown  their  suitability  in  the  thrust  range  0-20 
kN for operations encompassing micro-motors, sounding rockets, 
and DACS. In these studies, conducted using the doublet impinging 
jets and mono/bipropellant gel propellants, number of injector el- 
ements varied depending upon the thrust level in the range 1-60 
or more. Propellant mass ﬂow rates in the range 0.15-3.9 kg/s were 
required at P C = 8 MPa. The tests consisted of pulsed, programmed 
pulse,  and  continuous  ﬁrings  of  up  to  85  s  duration,  depending 
on the nature of application. These tests clearly indicate that gel 
propellants have now proven their potential over a range of op- 
erational requirements, from low-thrust and long-duration deploy- 
ment to high-thrust and short-duration scenarios. 

Given these encouraging developments, we are still faced with 
the challenges associated with reliable ignition during pulsed ﬁr- 
ing, increase in speciﬁc impulse, and improvements in the operat- 
ing eﬃciencies. 

7. Summary of state of the art 

Gelling is effective within some concentration range of the gel- 
lant.  Structurally  highly  stable  gel  propellants  are  not  useful  for 
propulsion.  State  of  the  art  in  formulation  stage  of  the  gel  pro- 
pellants is conﬁned to trial formulations of many combinations of 

organic and inorganic gellants. A few experimental programs have 
been taken forward from formulation to the atomization stage, and 
still fewer to the combustion stages. Only a handful of the formu- 
latd gel propellants have been deployed for powering the rockets. 
However, the surveyed studies give adequate information on many 
formulations and considerable progress has been achieved on the 
stability of gel propellants, parametric effects of gellant concentra- 
tion, and the mixing methods. 

Gel propellants exhibit a range of rheological behaviors encom- 
passing  shear  thinning,  yield  stress,  viscoelasticity,  and  time  de- 
pendence (thixotropy). Many research groups have published ex- 
perimental data on these properties by covering varying ranges of 
shear levels and other parameters. Fundamental studies on the cor- 
relation between gel propellant structure and its rheological behav- 
ior have been undertaken. A large fraction of the available data are 
accumulated for gel propellant simulants like water-Carbopol and 
water-fumed silica. Reduction of the rheological data to ﬂow mod- 
els and mechanical models has paved way for numerical studies in 
pipes and even full atomization has been computed. 

The trend has been to employ similar atomizer designs for the 
atomization of gel propellant as used for Newtonian ﬂuids. Imping- 
ing jet atomizers are the most commonly used among them, given 
that  they  are  the  atomizers  of  choice  for  many  projected  appli- 
cations of gel propellants. The surveyed literature also shows that 
many competing atomizer conﬁgurations of the airblast type have 
already been found useful for slurry fuels. Poor quality of spray of 
gel propellant has been attributed to viscosity. It appears that the 
atomizer designs employed in earlier studies have not been able to 
reduce the apparent shear viscosity of gel propellants. The reason 
for this important shortcoming of the existing atomizers lies in the 
failure to impart necessary amount of shear to the gel propellant 
jet within the shortest possible time. This requirement has been 
recognized in some studies though. Differences in the spray pat- 
terns between nongelled and gel propellants are not drastic as the 
underlying breakup mechanisms do not change signiﬁcantly. The 
major issue however is that of breakup time. There is no tangi-

ble conclusion on quantitative aspects of breakup pattern and the 
resulting  droplet  size  measurements.  However,  the  current  state 
of the art in atomization has also produced some striking results. 
These results suggest that some gel propellants are in fact less sta- 
ble during breakup than the base liquid propellants from which 
they were formulated. No clear picture has emerged yet on this is- 
sue although many possible factors have been advanced to explain 
this behavior. 

Combustion  of  gel  propellant  droplets  is  oscillatory  because 
droplet  vaporization  rate  is  controlled  by  the  jetting  of  fuel  va- 
pors induced by an elastic (and rheologically complex) gellant layer 
surrounding the vapor bubble. Interesting effects of this property 
have  been  predicted  for  the  diffusion  ﬂames  of  gel  propellant 
fuel sprays. According to the models, gel propellant spray ﬂames 
could behave very differently from the base liquid propellant spray 
ﬂames at the same conditions and exhibit isolated hot spots in the 
downstream of main ﬂame. Many studies on droplet combustion 
have appeared and excellent visualizations of the processes have 
been carried out. The gap between theoretical developments and 
experiments is however still wide and investigations of the spray 
ﬂames  are  almost  non-existent.  Ramjet  combustion  tests  for  the 
metalized gel propellants have already commenced and consider- 
able amount of performance data have been generated. A few in- 
direct references to combustion instability have been made. 

Intensive  research  and  development  has  culminated  in  test 
ﬂights of tactical missiles and sounding rockets in which optimized 
gel bi- and monopropellants were employed along with modiﬁca- 
tions in engine hardware. New applications for sub-orbital and or- 
bital operations are on the horizon. Metalized and non-metalized 
gel propellants could be equally useful in these applications. 

8. Roadmap for future progress 

Literature on formulation, rheological characterization, atomiza- 
tion, and combustion of gel propellants has progressed signiﬁcantly 
and  many  important  results  as  well  as  practical  demonstrations 
have been achieved. In the future, our achievements in this ﬁeld 
and advent of mature gel combustion and propulsion applications 
would depend upon the progress made in the following areas. We 
recommend the necessary effort s according to the major areas of 
development. 

8.1. Formulation 

Diﬃculty  in  optimizing  high  metal  loading  in  gel  propellants 
requires attention of the research community. Studies show that 
potentially most useful highly loaded metalized gel fuels behave 
more like unstable slurry fuels and the only way out currently is 
to settle for the less energetic (though structurally stable) formu- 
lations of metalized gel propellants to retain the homogeneity of 
composition and reduce scatter in the performance data. Experi- 
ence with slurry fuels indicate that metal loadings as high as 60 % 
can be achieved. This experience should be emulated in gel propel- 
lants, mainly with the help of well-planned large-scale formulation 
programs. 

Considering the intimate connections between formulation and 
rheology (and with atomization), optimization of the formulations 
henceforth should be carried out iteratively by including the rhe- 
ological and atomization data as part of the selection process for 
ﬁnal gel formulation. 

In  above  respect,  since  the  processing  conditions  would  vary 
with many factors, we suggest that systematic methods should be 
adopted in future in search for the optimal processing conditions 
for the targeted gel propellant. 

Large-scale formulation studies on the lines of NACA studies in 
early 1950s have not been undertaken for gel propellants and met- 

alized gel propellants. Thus, information on the stability of gels and 
effects of settling and stratiﬁcation on their rheological properties, 
sprayability, homogeneity of composition, remixing, and combus- 
tion is not available. Most of the reported formulation experiments 
are done at sub-kg scale and a few in the 1-10 kg scale. Effects 
of scale on the quality of formulated gel propellant are thus un- 
known and even the studies in the relatively economical range of 
0.1-10 kg have not been reported. 

Many  gellants  have  been  shown  to  be  useful  in  gelation  al- 
though very few of them have been tested at every stage of the 
gel fuel life cycle, from formulation to combustion. Moreover, their 
stability tests have not been undertaken. Systematic studies would 
be certainly helpful in reducing the existing number of gellants to 
a useful set from which to select for atomization and combustion. 
Particulate gellants appear to be promising in this respect. 

Exploratory  studies  using  an  optimal  combination  of  non- 
polymeric  organic  particulate  gellants  with  polymeric  gellants 
should  be  undertaken.  At  the  least,  the  goal  should  be  to  com- 
bine the ’extreme shear thinning’ of the particulate gellant with 
controlled viscoelasticity in one hybrid gel to enhance the insen- 
sitivity of the gel propellant. Such pre-programmed formulations 
could offer beneﬁts over conventional gellants in all stages of the 
gel propellant development. 

Use  of  surfactants  in  case  of  nanoparticulate  metals  is  com- 
mon  to  maintain  suspension.  However,  highly  loaded  metalized 
gels have been produced without requiring gellants. Fundamental 
studies are therefore required for assessing the necessity of using 
a gellant in highly loaded (nano-)metalized gels. 

8.2. Rheological characterization 

Elucidation  of  the  effects  of  yield  stress,  thixotropy,  and  vis- 
coelasticity  on  the  breakup  structures  remains  to  be  done.  This 
area of research should also be expanded to include the secondary 
breakup  events.  New  developments  in  the  dynamic  rheological 
characterization methods can be exploited for studies in this area. 
Rheological  characterization  of  ’extremely  shear  thinning’  gel 
propellants, which are incidentally produced from particulate gel- 
lants  and  metal  particles  should  be  handled  in  more  detail  and 
greater care. 

Further, rheological properties of extremely shear thinning gels 
might play a crucial role in their atomization characteristics. Gel 
propellants of high metal loading are likely to belong to this class. 
It is therefore essential to explore the correlation between breakup 
of such gels and their rheological properties. 

Classifying the gel propellants using many of the available me- 
chanical  models  in  ﬁxed  categories  is  not  conclusive  at  present 
because  many  of  these  gels  have  not  been  tested  extensively 
and only part of the data on a particular characteristic (viscosity, 
yield  stress,  viscoelasticity,  thixotropy,  and  ﬂow  model)  is  avail- 
able. Therefore, the information provided in Tables 7-10 needs to 
be supplemented with more data from future studies, especially on 
the gel propellants that have been used in atomization and com- 
bustion. 

Studies on the methods for in situ reduction of viscosity and in- 
line measurements should be simultaneously undertaken to aug- 
ment  the  viscosity  reduction  over  and  above  that  is  currently 
achieved by shear in the delivery and injection systems. Such stud- 
ies should prove useful for the eﬃcient designs of these systems in 
the volume-limited propulsion systems. 

Thermal effects on the rheological behavior of gel propellants 
come into effect during optimization of formulation process, long- 
term storage, and operation in engines. To the best of our knowl- 
edge,  well-controlled  and  rigorous  tests  on  this  aspect  have  not 
been undertaken for gel propellants.

8.3. Atomization 

Atomization  of  gel  propellants  has  been  shown  to  be  easier 
than the base liquid propellants in some cases. No clear reasoning 
has emerged for such cases at present. 

Breakup regimes of the gel propellants need to be systemati- 
cally probed to reveal the rheological effects, especially for the im- 
pact and sheetless regimes. 

Holes  are  invariably  present  in  the  gel  propellant  sheets  and 
their nucleation seems to be affected by particles in the case of 
particulate  gellants  and  metalized  gel  propellants.  More  studies 
are  required  to  characterize  the  sprays  involving  particulate  gel- 
lant and metal particles in which the distribution of these particles 
should be characterized for providing data to the modeling efforts 
in combustion of gel spray ﬂames. 

While a large number of disparate conﬁgurations of atomizers 
have been proposed, except for the conventional airblast, imping- 
ing jets, and the internally impinging atomizer, in-depth studies on 
other atomizers are still lacking, especially in terms of their suit- 
ability  for  combustion.  Serious  consideration  should  be  given  to 
the effervescent atomizer in this respect. 

Spray characterizations of many gel propellants have not been 
carried out while many trial formulations have appeared in litera- 
ture. Therefore, signiﬁcant scope for the generation of useful em- 
pirical data on droplet sizes and their distribution, spray proper- 
ties, etc. exists for a few judiciously selected gel propellants. 

Slurry fuel technology (metalized or otherwise) has matured in 
industrial combustion. Since slurry fuels share many features with 
gel propellants, especially those using particulate gellants and en- 
ergetic metal particles, atomizers found useful for slurry propel- 
lants should be viewed as promising ﬁrst candidates for developing 
eﬃcient atomization methods for gel propellants. 

As noted in the review, ejection of fuel jet vapors is preceded 
by nucleation of a hole on the surface of droplet. Therefore, current 
droplet vaporization and combustion models should be integrated 
with equations describing the rheological effects of viscoelasticity 
and the dependence of viscosity on temperature and shear. 

While it is amply demonstrated that the models could quali- 
tatively mimic the observed combustion behavior of a typical hy- 
pergolic gel droplet, the nature and source of the oscillations re- 
main to be explained. Also hidden at present are the mechanisms 
at work and the speciﬁc mathematical terms that could contribute 
to these oscillations. Such studies assume importance because it 
has not been yet possible to comprehensively analyze the problem 
through experiments. 

Future work in droplet combustion and oscillating vaporization 
should address the interacting physical mechanisms responsible for 
oscillatory vaporization of the liquid fuel contained in the gellant 
matrix. Both experimental and modeling work is required. Also es- 
sential in this regard is the evolution of a statistical description of 
the oscillatory vaporization that could be included in the compu- 
tational models. 

Quantitative comparison between the theoretical predictions of 
spray ﬂame models and experimental data are yet to appear. This 
is however not surprising given that experiments on the canonical 
laminar spray ﬂames of gel fuels such as a premixed ﬂame and 
Burke-Schumann diffusion ﬂame have not been attempted. 

Signiﬁcant effort in understanding the fundamental properties 
of  spray  ﬂames  is  urgently  required  to  bridge  the  gap  between 
theory and empirical knowledge and improve the existing model- 
ing capability. Except for the bluff body stabilized spray ﬂames, no 
other experimental conﬁgurations have been studied. Theory needs 
extensive data from experiments on the combustion of gel propel- 
lants in canonical ﬂame conﬁgurations. 

Original approaches to the design of a new atomizer should ex- 
ploit the rheological behavior of gel propellants. Proper execution 
of such an approach should consider the effect of rheological prop- 
erties on the breakup structures. 

Very few atomizers have been actually tested in realistic labo- 
ratory ﬂames. Work should be taken forward in these cases so that 
potential of the numerous conﬁgurations can be tested and judg- 
ment as to their usefulness can be formed. 

Tendency of gels based on particulate gellants (especially silica) 
and metal particles to form irregularly shaped breakup fragments 
has been well documented. Dynamics of these fragments and their 
effect  on  spray  ﬂames  should  be  studied.  Approaches  that  com- 
bine  two  gellants,  one  of  them  being  a  polymeric,  should  prove 
useful in striking a balance between the tendency to form irregu- 
lar fragments and relatively easy atomization when particulate gel- 
lants and metal particles are incorporated in the gel propellants. 

Secondary atomization of the droplets of metalized slurry fuels 
is already known to be critically important for metal ignition and 
combustion. Similar issues are expected to arise in the metalized 
gel fuels and conﬁrmatory data are required. 

8.4. Combustion 

Ignition  of  gel  droplets  and  the  mechanisms  of  heat  transfer 
have not been investigated. The effectiveness of different ignition 
methods should be investigated, especially in terms of the attain- 
able heat transfer rates during energy deposition in a small vol- 
ume. 

Mathematical  models  describing  the  combustion  of  inorganic 
gel droplet have not been reported in literature to the best of our 
knowledge and it is anticipated that future effort s in this direction 
would consider shell formation, effects of shell properties, and the 
causes behind the reduced probability of microexplosion in inor- 
ganic gel droplet combustion. 

Only sporadic attempt has been made to quantify the effects 
of droplet size, gellant concentration, and ambient conditions on 
the frequency of oscillations during the vaporization of gel droplet 
composed of an organic gellant. 

Recent theoretical analysis predicted the stabilizing effect of gel 
droplets on the oscillations in propagation velocity of a premixed 
laminar spray ﬂame of gel droplets. Speciﬁc experiments are now 
required for the validation and improvement of such predictions. 

Theoretical models to date rely on the assumption of a ﬁxed 
temperature for the onset of oscillating vaporization and its effects. 
Effort s should now be directed towards more realistically modeled 
onset of oscillations in vaporization and avoid arbitrary assignment 
of frequencies of oscillations. 

No experimental evidence of the importance of oscillatory com- 
bustion  in  the  spray  ﬂames  appears  to  have  been  accumulated 
and its exact signiﬁcance in spray ﬂames remains unknown. Given 
this, currently available results indicate that bluff body stabilized 
spray ﬂames of a gel fuel are smaller in length than the liquid fuel 
spray ﬂames and combustion of gel propellant is almost complete. 
The many likely factors considered responsible for this observation 
should be probed further. 

Metalized  gel  fuels  are  very  important  for  ramjet  propulsion 

and fundamental studies are therefore required. 

Performance of the impinging jets in high-pressure combustion 
could be affected by a small injector parameter. As this deﬁciency 
has been shown to be a likely cause of the combustion instabil- 
ity in motors, careful investigations should be carried out in future 
for verifying the existing ﬁndings. Such studies are crucial due to 
the possible ramiﬁcations for highly loaded metalized as well as 
extremely shear thinning gel propellants. 

Effective remedial measures are required for preventing the loss 
of performance of ramjet motors using metalized gel propellants. 
Current  levels  of  eﬃciency  are  low  and  intensive  efforts  are  re- 
quired to ﬁnd solutions for the issues of eﬃcient viscosity reduc- 

142

tion in a short span of length and time, injector performance, in- 
creased metal loading, strategies for adequate oxidation of metal 
particles, management of solid oxide particles, etc. 

The role of gellant in combustion should be examined in detail 
because results show that gellant increases the combustion stabil- 
ity at the expense of reduced eﬃciency. 

Metalized gel propellants have almost exclusively use Al. How- 
ever, novel ways of using Mg and B in them should be considered 
for the mitigation of handling issues associated with Al 
3 and im- 
provement of engine performance.

9. Concluding remarks 

Gel propulsion has not yet reached maturity and additional re- 
search has to be conducted. However, the time for demonstrators 
has  come.  In  several  countries,  hydrazine  gel  for  rocket  applica- 
tions  will  be  employed,  increasing  the  safety  and  exploiting  the 
hypergolicity  advantages  of  a  proven  propellant.  However,  Euro- 
pean efforts are towards avoiding the use of hydrazine at all. Gel 
monopropellants will be used too and most probably, in the near 
future  we  will  see  applications  of  non-toxic,  hypergolic  gel  pro- 
pellants. The gel fuel ramjet engine using boron seems also to be 
very promising. Eventually, gel propulsion will ﬁnd its place among 
solid, liquid, and hybrid propulsion.
