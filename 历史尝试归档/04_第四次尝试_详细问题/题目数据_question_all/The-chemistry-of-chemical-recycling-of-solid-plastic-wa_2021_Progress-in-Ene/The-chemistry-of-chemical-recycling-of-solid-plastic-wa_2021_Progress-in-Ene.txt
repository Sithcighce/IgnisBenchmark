Chemical recycling of solid plastic waste (SPW) is a paramount opportunity to reduce marine and land 
pollution and to enable the incorporation of the circular economy principle in today’s society. In ad- 
dition to more conscious behaviors and wiser product design (“design for recycling”), a key challenge 
is the identiﬁcation of the leading recycling technologies, minimizing the global warming potential in 
an industrially relevant context. Chemical recycling technologies based on pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation are 
leading the way because of their robustness and good economics, but an improved understanding of the 
chemistry and more innovative reactor designs are required to realize a potential reduction of green- 
house gas emissions of more than 100 million tonnes of CO 2 -eq., primarily by more eﬃcient use of 
valuable natural resources. The feed ﬂexibility of thermal processes supports the potential of pyrolysis 
and gasiﬁcation, however, the strong variability in time and space of blending partners such as multiple 
and co-polymers, additives, and contaminants (such as inorganic materials) calls for accurate assessment 
through fundamental experiments and models. Such complex and variable mixtures are strongly sensi- 
tive to the process design and conditions: temperature, residence time, heating rates – severity, mixing 
level, heat and mass transfer strongly affect the thermal degradation of SPW and its selectivity to valu- 
able products. A prerequisite in improving design and performance is the ability to model conversion 
proﬁles and product distributions based on accurate rate coeﬃcients for the dominating reaction families 
established using ﬁrst-principle derived transport and thermodynamic properties. These models should 
also help with the “design for recycling” strategy to increase recyclability, for example by identifying 
additives that make chemical recycling diﬃcult. Fundamental experiments of increased quality (accu- 
racy, integrity, validity, replicability, completeness) together with improved deterministic kinetic models, 
systematically developed according to the reaction classes and rate rules approach, provide insights to 
identify optimal process conditions. This will allow shedding some light upon the important pathways 
involved in the thermal degradation of the feedstock and the formation/disappearance of desired or un- 
wanted products. In parallel, the intrinsic kinetics of the dominating elementary reaction steps should be 
determined with higher accuracy, moving beyond single step kinetics retrieved from thermogravimetric 
analysis experiments. Together with more accurate kinetic parameters, better models to account for heat 
and mass transfer limitations also need to be further developed, since plastic degradation involves at 
least three phases (solid, liquid, gas), whose interactions should be accounted for in a more rigorous way. 
Novel experimental approaches ( e.g. detailed feedstock and product characterization using comprehen- 
sive chromatographic techniques and photoionization mass spectrometry) and available computational 
tools ( e.g. kinetic Monte Carlo, liquid phase, and heterogeneous theoretical kinetics) are needed to tackle 
these problems and improve our fundamental understanding of chemical recycling of SPW.

1. The plastic waste crisis: A tale of mismanagement 

Plastics,  i.e.  a  subset  of  polymers  that  are  typically  used  for 
commodity materials, are becoming more and more present in our 
everyday life as hinted by them being the most highly demanded 
commodity materials. Production of plastics growth averaged 8.7% 
per year from 1950 to 2012, booming from 1.7 million tonnes in 
1950 to 335 million tonnes of production in 2016 [1] . The tremen- 
dous beneﬁts of plastics in our daily life are indisputable, however, 
like many great things in life, plastics also come at a cost. 

As a direct consequence of their vast production numbers, plas- 
tics are one of the main contributors to the waste management 
problem on land and in seas and rivers [ 2 , 3 ]. Reports suggest that 
95% of plastic packaging material value, or USD 80–120 billion an- 
nually, is lost to the economy only after a short ﬁrst-use cycle [4] . 
This underlines the necessity of new perspectives, in line with the 
principles of the circular economy thus closing the ‘loop‘, to tackle 
the waste management problem of plastics [5] . In this context, the 

way plastic waste is being managed nowadays should be reevalu- 
ated  by  assessing  promising  chemical  recycling  technologies  like 
pyrolysis  or  gasiﬁcation  of  plastics.  This  is  crucial  since  landﬁll- 
ing, which is one of the most common solid plastic waste (SPW) 
management strategies, poses both short-term and long-term risks 
including,  but  not  limited  to,  excessive  land  utilization,  soil  and 
groundwater contamination, air pollution, disruption of wildlife, as 
well as the emission of harmful greenhouse gasses (GHGs) [6–10] . 
On the other hand, the energy recovery route (incineration of plas- 
tics), which is another vastly prevalent route, is less favorable both 
from an environmental and economic point of view. Unfortunately, 
mechanical recycling also does not offer a perfectly sustainable so- 
lution for closing ‘the loop‘ (see Section 3.2.3), while re-use is only 
feasible to a limited extent in most cases. Therefore, chemical recy- 
cling should be complementary to mechanical recycling in achiev- 
ing a circular economy. 

Chemical recycling is a steadily growing route which has high 
potential even for heterogeneous and contaminated plastic waste

material  [11–13] .  Using  pyrolysis  and/or  gasiﬁcation  technologies 
to produce fuels and/or chemicals from plastic waste can address 
the challenges of plastic waste management and increasing global 
energy  demand  simultaneously  [ 2 , 14–16 ].  The  amount  of  energy 
and  raw  materials  required  for  producing  new  polymers  will  be 
cut  down  since  chemical  recycling  will  simultaneously  eliminate 
SPW while producing fuels and/or chemicals in return. Thus, we 
will not need to spend additional energy and crude oil which oth- 
erwise would have been incorporated as an additional burden to 
the ‘loop’. Likewise, chemical recycling of SPW has the potential to 
save ∼3.5 billion barrels of oil, which translates to an annual mon- 
etary saving of USD 176 billion [3] . Rahimi and Garcia state that 
in the U.S. alone, the economic savings related to reduced oil us- 
age due to chemically recycling SPW will correspond to a ∼USD 
38 billion/year of savings to the U.S. economy [3] . The U.S. Envi- 
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that a reduction of 1.87 
2 -equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per ton of re- 
tonnes of CO 
cycled SPW can be achieved [17] . The imperative role of chemical 
recycling in the circular economy can be seen in Fig. 1 . The overall 
goal of the circular economy is to keep the vast majority of the ma- 
terials within the ‘loop’ and to decrease fuel and natural resources 
consumption simultaneous with decreasing GHGs and waste pro- 
duction. In order to achieve this ambitious goal, the fundamentals 
of chemical recycling need to be understood thoroughly. 

In this review, the state of the art of different kinetic modeling 
approaches of the non-catalytic pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation processes 
for waste plastics is summarized. The primary aim is to bridge the 
gap between kinetic and reactor modeling aspects, with the ulti- 
mate goal of improving and/or creating state-of-the-art pyrolysis 
and  gasiﬁcation  technologies  for  the  thermal  treatment  of  solid 
plastic  wastes.  In  that  regard,  detailed  kinetic  modeling  and  re- 
lated experimental studies are covered throughout the article next 
to existing and promising technologies. This is supported by a criti- 
cal analysis of literature models and a discussion of micro-, meso–, 
and macro-scale phenomena which is presented in Section 5.

2.1. General data 

A vast number of natural and synthetic polymers ﬁnd applica- 
tion in both domestic and industrial sectors such as household ap- 
pliances, furniture, textile, packaging, agriculture, healthcare, build- 
ing and construction, medicine, electrical and electronics, automo- 
tive and aerospace components, fuel, and energy [6] . Polymers are 
so widespread all around the globe mainly because of their supe-

rior properties such as lightweight, durability, low cost, and ease 
of production [18–23] . 

On top of these, Zhou et al. state that the polymer industry pro- 
vides jobs, and spurs growth and competitiveness in a global econ- 
omy [6] . To give an overall idea, the plastics industry gives direct 
employment to over 1.5 million people and contributed close to 30 
billion EUR to the economy in 2016 in Europe [1] . For more than 
50 years, the global production of plastics has continued to rise 
steadily and nowadays nearly 8% of the crude oil consumed world- 
wide is used for the production of plastics and to power plastic 
manufacturing processes [24] . Plastics production trends between 
1950 and 2012 in Europe, as well as the whole world, can be seen 
in Fig. 2 . A more recent change in plastics production is the in- 
crease in worldwide production from 322 million tonnes in 2015 
to 335 million tonnes in 2016 [1] .

the  need  to  eventually  dispose  of  or  recycle  these  end-products 
[ 28 , 29 ]. One of the most signiﬁcant challenges regarding the sus- 
tainability of plastic usage is the wide disparity in plastic usage 
time or service life [30] . As can be seen in Fig. 4 , Geyer et al. plot- 
ted the product lifetime distributions for the eight industrial use 
sectors as log-normal probability distribution functions [31] , indi- 
cating how long different types of plastics are in use before they 
reach the end of their useful lifetimes and are discarded. As can 
be seen in Fig. 4 , the product lifetime of most packaging plastics 
is less than a year, whereas construction plastics have an average 
product lifespan of several decades. By further inspecting Fig. 3 si- 
multaneously with Fig. 4 , it can be seen that the most common 
end-use application of plastics is packaging by far and this means 
that  a  signiﬁcant  fraction  of  the  plastics  produced  has  a  useful 
service life below even one month [ 32 , 33 ]. The short useful life- 
time of plastics poses a great environmental risk in the long run 
if the waste management problem is handled inadequately and in- 
eﬃciently [34–38] . Today, we are already seeing the repercussions 
of  this  tale  of  mismanagement  such  as  gigantic  oceanic  garbage 
patches as well as microplastics pollution. It is estimated that ev- 
ery year at least 8 million tonnes of SPW leak into the ocean to 
stack on these already existing gargantuan garbage patches [39] . 
Current estimates show that, if this trend continues, the ocean will 
contain more plastics than ﬁsh (by weight) by 2050 [ 4 , 39 ]. GHG 
emissions from plastic production are also a big concern [40] : it is 
predicted that GHG emissions from plastics production will reach 
15% of the global carbon budget by 2050 unless recycling effort s 
are drastically boosted [4] . 

Together with the striking increase in the production ( Fig. 2 ) 
and utilization of plastics, the amount of plastic waste being pro- 
duced escalates rapidly as well [ 2 , 3 ]. As a result, the issue of plas- 
tic waste disposal also comes into question immediately. All the 
detailed data demonstrated above clearly point out the vast avail- 
ability of petroleum-based plastic waste, which can potentially be 
used to derive energy, fuels, and chemicals. This means that the 
plastic recycling industry has a strong potential to contribute sig- 
niﬁcantly to the global economy. 

2.2. Speciﬁc data 

2.2.1. Mixed plastic waste 

Solid plastic waste (SPW) composition varies greatly geograph- 
ically and it is imperative to characterize any waste stream pre- 
cisely before attempting to establish an optimal process design for 
pyrolysis/gasiﬁcation. Al-Salem et al. state that SPW mainly con- 
sists of HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PVC, and PET [41] . Because of PE’s vo- 
luminous  production  and  usage  rate,  it  makes  up  about  40%  of 
the  SPW  in  the  total  municipal  waste  stream  [42] .  However,  an 
accurate characterization of the feedstock composition greatly in- 
ﬂuences the ﬁnal product distributions of thermo-chemical recy- 
cling processes [42] . Before digging deeper into the composition of 

Fig. 3.  Estimated consumption of plastic by the end-use sector (adapted from [26] , 
Notes: Estimates based on data are for Europe, the United States, China, and India 
for 2002–2014). 

According  to  a  2017  PlasticsEurope  report,  the  major  plastics 
produced in Europe can be ranked in terms of their demand as 
follows: polypropylene (PP) (19.3 wt%) > low-density polyethylene 
(LDPE) (17.5 wt%) > high-density polyethylene (HDPE) (12.3 wt%) 
> poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) (10 wt%) > polyurethanes (PUR) (7.5 
wt%) > poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) (7.4 wt%) > polystyrene 
(PS) (6.7 wt%) [1] . The global plastic demand is shown in Fig. 3 , 
where  packaging  is  the  largest  end-use  segment  of  plastic  con- 
sumption by a wide margin and accounts for 36%. The packaging 
segment  includes  both  consumer  packaging,  such  as  drinks  bot- 
tles made of PET, and the packaging used for business-to-business 
transactions and in the industry [ 26 , 27 ]. The second-largest end- 
use segment is the construction industry, which accounts for 16% 
of the global consumption. An important contributor to the con- 
struction sector is PVC, as it is used for window and door frames, 
and underground pipes, due to its stiffness and durability [26] . The 
third-largest end-use segment is synthetic textiles, which account 
for 15% of the global consumption. Some of the key synthetic ﬁber 
products include rope, carpet, and clothing, alongside a large col- 
lection of specialty textile applications. For instance, Kevlar® is a 
type of lightweight, heat-resistant and strong synthetic ﬁber, used 
to e.g. manufacture bullet-proof body armors. 

One  of  the  primary  policy  goals  for  Europe,  and  the  whole 
world, is evolving into a clean and circular economy. Within the 
circular  economy  approach,  waste  management  of  SPW  holds  a 
crucial place [28] . Inside the waste management framework, chem- 
ical  recycling  must  be  used  complementary  to  mechanical  recy- 
cling so that the ‘loop‘ can be sustainably closed. Chemical recy- 
cling will aid in compensating for the drawbacks of mechanical re- 
cycling, in particular the production of lower quality products and

packaging materials, iron, aluminum), and inappropriate materials 
(paper, glass, clothing waste, wood waste) [49] . The results from 
the study underline the complexity of SPW as well as the signiﬁ- 
cance of the effective sorting of waste. 

Furthermore, in the study of Sogancioglu et al. in 2017, HDPE 
and LDPE plastic packaging wastes were pyrolyzed in the temper- 
ature  range  of  300  -  700 °C  [51] .  These  packaging  wastes  were 
obtained from the separation and transfer station of a local solid 
waste collection company (in Konya, Turkey). The elemental com- 
position of the unwashed HDPE and LDPE wastes can be seen in 
Table 1 . The carbon content of LDPE was higher than that of HDPE 
due to the presence of other elements originating from additives of 
the package such as dye, glue, etc. and from pollutants and impuri- 
ties on the package’s inner and outer surfaces. Additionally, Singh 
et al. collected different plastic waste samples from MSW at dif- 
ferent locations in Durgapur (West Bengal, India) [52] . The SPW 
was  separated  into  component  fractions  as  58.6%  PE  (HDPE  and 
LDPE), 26.7% PP, 8.7% PS, 5.6% PET and 0.4% thermosetting plastics. 
Component analysis of mixed and individual SPWs can be seen in 
Table 2 . 

Kaminsky  et  al.  studied  the  collected  plastic  fraction  from 
household separation in Hamburg – Bergedorf, Germany [53] . The 
composition of the SPW and the elemental analysis of the material 
can be seen in Fig. 7 . 

Hence, it is clear that SPW composition highly varies depend- 
ing on the geographical region. The composition of typical plas- 
tic waste mixtures is directly related to the extent of production 
of  various  plastic  types  and  the  corresponding  product  lifetime. 
The  ﬁrst  step  in  creating  an  optimal  process  design  for  pyroly- 
sis/gasiﬁcation should be the characterization of the waste stream 
to be used as feedstock. The consecutive step after accurate char- 
acterization of the feedstock is to create a comprehensive model 
that can simulate the pyrolysis/gasiﬁcation behavior of SPW. The 
complexity and diversity of plastic waste streams can pose a prob- 
lem for the accuracy of pyrolysis/gasiﬁcation models. Coupling of 
the detailed feedstock characterization with detailed modeling ap-

SPW, it is beneﬁcial to look into the municipal solid waste (MSW) 
composition. This will be helpful to understand how much plastic 
can be potentially separated from the rest of the waste and what 
can  be  potential  contaminants  in  this  post-consumer  separation. 
It should be noted that SPW resulting from home separation by 
households will be less contaminated than MSW and thus easier 
to process. Representative values for the composition of MSW in 
the U.S., China, and Europe can be seen in Fig. 5 [43–45] . 

Additionally, it is imperative to characterize the SPW to be used 
as  a  feedstock  in  chemical  recycling,  which  may  or  may  not  be 
a  part  of  MSW  as  mentioned  above.  On  average,  about  10.6  ±
5.1 wt%  of  municipal  wastes  are  calculated  to  be  made  of  plas- 
tics [ 2 , 46–48 ]. In Western Europe, approximately 63 wt% of plas- 
tic waste comes from packaging materials, which corresponds to 
about 14.5 million tonnes per year [49] . Adrados et al. conducted 
a study where they have collected real plastic waste samples from 
BZB, a local material recovery facility responsible for the separa- 
tion and classiﬁcation of packaging waste in Bizkaia, Spain [ 49 , 50 ]. 
The composition of the plastics portion of the SPW from Adrados 
et al.’s study can be seen in Fig. 6 [49] . The authors classiﬁed the 
components of the sample into three main groups: packaging plas- 
tics ( ≈60%, mainly PE and PP), other packaging materials (complex

proaches is absolutely crucial since this will give a more coherent 
understanding of the feasibility of the actual process for various 
feedstocks. Additional challenges and valorization aspects of chem- 
ical recycling will be discussed in Section 3.2. 

2.2.2. Microplastics 

Microplastics are deﬁned as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm 
in  size  [54–56] .  They  can  originate  from  primary  (small  plastic 
particles readily found in cosmetic and medical products) or sec- 
ondary (fragmentation products of physical, chemical, and biologi- 
cal processes) sources. Microplastic pollution is a concern for both 
marine and terrestrial environments [55–59] . According to the cal- 
culations of Jambeck et al., ∼1.8 - 4.6% of the total of 275 million 
tonnes of plastic waste produced in the year 2010 ended up in the 
oceans [60] . On the other hand, the major component of terrestrial 
plastic litter is the wind-blown debris of waste material which es- 
capes  into  the  environment  [61] .  All  of  the  polymers  ending  up 
in  marine  and  terrestrial  environments  are  slowly  converted  to 
microplastics by different environmental stresses [ 56 , 57 , 62 ]. Sev- 
eral studies report the composition of microplastics collected from 
different environments all around the world [63–66] . A collection 
of representative compositional data on microplastic samples col- 
lected from different locations around the world is presented in 
Table 3 . It is not surprising that the most abundant polymers found 
in microplastic are the ones with the highest production numbers 
worldwide. Although polyvinyl ester (PVE) and nylon are not pre- 
dominantly produced globally, they are still abundant in microplas- 
tics in marine environments. This is due to the fact that PVE is 
commonly used in the maritime sector and nylon pieces are eas- 
ily broken off of clothing items to end up in waterways. The mi- 
croplastic samples collected from all around the world once again 
show that the use of plastics comes at a higher price than typically 
is assumed. 

3. Current opportunities and challenges for plastic waste 
management 

A total of 27.1 million tonnes of plastic waste was collected in 
the EU28 + NO/CH in 2016, of which 31.1% was effectively recycled, 
41.6% was utilized in energy recovery and the remaining 27.3% was 
landﬁlled [1] . Lau et al.’s 2020 study established models to esti- 
mate the effectiveness of interventions to reduce plastic pollution 
for ﬁve scenarios between 2016 and 2040 [69] . It was noted that 
implementing all feasible interventions reduced SPW pollution by 
40% from 2016 rates and 78% relative to a ‘business as usual’ sce- 
nario in 2040 [69] . This means that even with the most optimistic 
best-case scenario of immediate and concerted global action, 710 
million metric tons of plastic waste were calculated to have cumu- 
latively entered aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. 

Plastics post-consumer waste treatment trends between 2006 
and 2016 can be seen in Fig. 8 . Although the fraction of total plas- 
tic waste used for recycling and energy recovery has been increas- 
ing steadily due to tighter environmental policies, almost 7.4 Mt 
of plastics waste was still landﬁlled in Europe in 2016. The vast 
amount of landﬁlled plastic waste is quite substantial since it has 
a high potential to be used for energy recovery or as a feedstock 
to produce value-added products. One of the key economic barri- 
ers in 2020 inhibiting increased recycling is the low price of fossil 
fuel-based plastics [40] , which is primarily determined by crude 
oil prices. It is important to note that recycling one tonne of plas- 
tic waste has the potential to save nearly 130 billion Joules of en- 
ergy [3] . This value assumes converting one tonne of SPW to vir- 
gin plastic with 100% eﬃciency and no energy loss. Although these 
assumptions  are  overly  optimistic,  this  value,  therefore,  provides 
merely an order of magnitude interpretation of the potential con- 
tribution of the chemical recycling of SPW. Besides, the landﬁlled 
plastic waste poses a major environmental threat due to its non-

degradability in addition to being a potential health risk for both 
aquatic and terrestrial animals [ 2 , 70 , 71 ]. Discarding plastic waste 
into landﬁlls leads to severe contamination of the earth’s surface 
because common polymers need hundreds of years on average to 
degrade in normal environmental conditions [7] . One far-reaching 
consequence  of  landﬁlling  is  waste  relocating  and  ending  up  in 
the marine and terrestrial environments. Especially aquatic animals 
are under serious threat since the human-produced waste streams 
ending up in oceans pile up in garbage patches, in which the plas- 
tic debris accounts for 60–80% of all marine litter [ 72 , 73 ]. Kunwar 
et al. reported that plastic waste in the North Paciﬁc Ocean has 
increased 100-fold in the last 40 years [2] . The disposal of SPW 
into landﬁlls also leads to the signiﬁcant concern of microplastic 
pollution, which will be discussed in Section 3.1. Plastic waste is 
also harmful because of its pigments containing many trace ele- 
ments that are highly toxic [ 7 , 74 ]. The greatest fraction of all plas- 
tic wastes is comprised of PE with a striking 69% on average and 
this is mainly because of the enormous amount of plastic bags in 
the SPW stream [ 47 , 75 ]. On top of this, PE also comprises roughly 
63% of the total packaging waste [ 2 , 76 ]. 

3.1. Microplastic pollution 

Microplastic  pollution  is  a  recent  hot-topic  in  environmental 
and ecotoxicological research and raises serious concerns amongst 
the scientiﬁc community [ 54 , 77 , 78 ]. These concerns are absolutely 
legitimate  since  microplastics  have  been  discovered  on  a  multi- 
tude of beaches around the world, on the surface of every open 

ocean,  and  inside  numerous  living  organisms  [ 57 , 79–83 ].  A  col- 
lection of representative compositional data on microplastic sam- 
ples  collected  from  different  locations  around  the  world  can  be 
seen in Table 3 . As mentioned above, abundant plastic types are 
in  line  with  worldwide  production  numbers  mentioned  in  Sec- 
tion 2.1. Characteristics such as lightweight, ﬂoatability, and shape 
allow  plastic  waste  to  travel  great  distances  across  the  globe 
[ 57 , 84–86 ].  Eriksen  et  al.  state  that  microplastics  are  so  ubiqui- 
tous in the world’s oceans that they represent approximately 92.4% 
of  the  global  particle  count  of  plastics  [87] .  As  a  result  of  this 
abundance, microplastics can be found nearly everywhere in ma- 
rine  environments:  in  sediments,  throughout  the  water  column, 
and in digestive systems and tissues of marine organisms [ 85 , 88 ]. 
It  is  suspected  that  microplastics  might  also  pose  a  higher  risk 
to marine fauna, when compared with macroplastics, because of 
their high surface area-volume ratio [55] . Furthermore, microplas- 
tics pose global environmental and health concerns since they can 
interact with other environmental contaminants and adsorb them 
at  the  surface  and  they  can  be  ingested  by  biota  [89–92] .  The 
fact that they can reside in the environment for multiple decades 
makes  all  of  these  interactions  far  more  probable.  Additionally, 
Bretas  Alvim  et  al.  state  that  due  to  the  hydrophobicity  of  mi- 
croplastics, other pollutants, such as persistent organic pollutants 
(POPs), can be sorbed by these particles that act as vectors for the 
contamination of other environments and animals, leading to bio- 
magniﬁcation [93] . 

Plastic  debris  is  broadly  classiﬁed  by  size:  mega-debris 
( > 100 mm), macro-debris ( > 20 mm), meso–debris (20–5 mm), and 

8 

O. Dogu, M. Pelucchi, R. Van de Vijver et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100901 

micro-debris ( < 5 mm) [ 56 , 94 ]. It is acknowledged that plastic par- 
ticles  in  the  environment  will  continue  to  degrade  and  become 
steadily  smaller,  eventually  forming  ‘nanoplastics’  [ 56 , 95 , 96 ].  As 
mentioned in Section 2.2.2, there are two types of microplastics: 
primary  and  secondary.  An  effective  way  of  combatting  primary 
microplastics in the environment can be governmental bans on us- 
ing  these  types  of  materials  in  the  production  of  different  con- 
sumer  products.  However,  secondary  microplastics  will  be  much 
harder to tackle. As mentioned above, secondary microplastics re- 
sult from the breaking down of larger plastic items into smaller 
fragments [ 84 , 85 ]. There are many natural contributors to this pro- 
cess.  Different  weathering  conditions  can  be  destructive  in  long 
time  scales.  For  instance,  solar  radiation  facilitates  the  oxidative 
degradation  of  polymers  [ 97 , 98 ].  On  top  of  that,  in  marine  en- 
vironments,  salinity  together  with  mechanical  abrasion  such  as 
winds,  waves,  ocean  currents  further  contributes  to  the  break- 
ing down of polymers into smaller fragments [ 85 , 97 , 98 ]. Experts 
in  the  ﬁeld  agree  that  the  majority  of  microplastics  in  the  en- 
vironment are secondary, derived from macroplastics sources via 
fragmentation [ 54 , 65 , 77 , 79 , 98 ]. However, very little information is 
present on fragmentation rates of macroplastics in the literature 
[ 54 , 99 ]. 

It should be noted that some technologies exist for the removal 
of  microplastics  from  wastewater  and  sewage  sludge  [100–105] . 
Even with high theoretical eﬃciencies (eliminating more than 90% 
of the inﬂuent microplastics), the run-off fraction from these treat- 
ment facilities is still considerably high in microplastics concentra- 
tion since the quantity of processed waste streams is colossal [93] . 
Thus, experts of environmental sciences agree that the recycling of 
SPW is a crucial step in reducing the vast amounts of plastics en- 
tering the aquatic and terrestrial environments [ 54 , 77 , 78 , 84 , 106 ]. 
To  this  extent,  chemical  recycling  complementary  to  mechanical 
recycling has immense potential to tackle the microplastic pollu- 
tion issue together with the macroplastics pollution. 

3.2. Biopolymers and biochemical recycling 

One way to combat microplastic pollution can lie in the design 
of  bio-based  plastics,  biodegradable  polymers,  and  compostable 
plastics [107–112] . Spierling et al. estimate that substituting 65.8% 
of the world’s conventional plastics with bio-based plastics would 
avoid 241–316 Mt CO 
2 -equivalent per year [113] . Bio-based plastics 
are readily available on the market in both biodegradable and non- 
biodegradable forms [110] . There is a strong consensus in the lit- 
erature that most petroleum-based plastics are prominently resis- 
tant to microbial degradation and thus will persist in the environ- 
ment for a very long time [114–119] . The main aim of the design 
of biodegradable polymers is to control the ultimate service life- 
time. This can be done by either stabilizing the polymer or chem- 
ically accelerating the degradation reactions [ 120 , 121 ]. It is impor- 
tant to state that bio-based plastics generally show lower life-cycle 
GHG emissions than their fossil fuel-based equivalents [ 122 , 123 ]. 
Additionally, the scale of production and use of biodegradable plas- 
tics are still quite limited due to their lower durability and lack of 
compatibility with existing equipment and end-of-life management 
systems  [ 24 , 114 ].  Although  a  switch  towards  biopolymers  seems 
promising, it will take a very long time in practice to adapt the 
already existing production processes towards their biodegradable 
counterparts. 

Some  examples  of  biodegradable  polymers,  that  can  degrade 
in  nature,  include  polylactic  acid  (PLA),  thermoplastic  starch 
(TPS),  polyhydroxyalkanoate  (PHA),  polycaprolactone  (PCL),  and 
poly(butylene  adipate-co-terephthalate)  (PBAT)  [ 114 , 124 ].  Among 
these  examples,  PCL  and  PBAT  are  fossil  fuel-based  while  PLA, 
TPS,  and  PHA  are  bio-based  polymers  [ 114 , 124 ].  This  points  to 
the  fact  that  the  origin  of  the  polymer  does  not  necessarily  af- 

fect its end-of-life fate and some fossil fuel-based plastics can also 
be  suitable  for  biochemical  recycling  [124] .  It  is  also  crucial  to 
note that not all of the so-called bioplastics derived from renew- 
able resources are readily biodegradable [ 118 , 119 , 125–127 ]. For in- 
stance, it is reported that 100% bio-based PE and bio-based PET 
are not biodegradable, since their chemical structure does not dif- 
fer from oil-based PET and PE [ 128 , 129 ]. There exist many reviews 
on the enzymatic degradation of biodegradable plastics in the liter- 
ature [ 118 , 130 , 131 ]. Additionally, the biochemical recycling poten- 
tial of consumer plastics has been getting increasing attention in 
the last decades and many reviews on the topic were put together 
[ 114 , 116 , 132–137 ]. 

The  acceptable  time  period  for  biodegradation  to  occur  and 
how  it  is  measured  is  quite  pivotal  in  the  ﬁeld  of  biodegrad- 
able  polymers  [138–140] .  For  practical  and  economic  purposes, 
biodegradation time should be signiﬁcantly lower than their fos- 
sil  fuel-based  equivalents  [141] .  The  proposed  time  frame  for 
biodegradation is 56 days in water environments and up to 2 years 
in soil as declared in currently employed international standards 
such as ISO and ASTM [ 128 , 142 ]. On the other hand, the proposed 
time frame for managed environments, such as home composting, 
industrial composting, and anaerobic digestion is 1 year, 180 days, 
and  15 days,  respectively  [142] .  Currently,  the  most  widespread 
disposal method for biodegradable polymers is composting [139] . 
However,  it  is  crucial  to  state  that  composting  requires  an  ad- 
vanced infrastructure, including collection systems and compost- 
ing facilities [ 139 , 141 ]. These economic and practical reasons are 
important obstacles standing in front of the global widespread us- 
age of composting. In contrast to the composting route, the feasi- 
bility of the chemical recycling of biodegradable polymers should 
also be assessed. The high resistance of polymers towards enzy- 
matic degradation mainly stems from the high molecular weight 
of the ﬁber, the strong C –C bonds, and the extremely hydrophobic 
surface [143] . As a result of the extreme recalcitrance of plastics 
to microbial degradation, hybrid methods which employ pyrolysis 
to  produce  oils,  which  are  subsequently  fed  to  bacteria  also  ex- 
ist [ 124 , 144–146 ]. In this unconventional route to connect techni- 
cal and biological parts of the circular economy, the combination 
of pyrolysis and microbiology to convert non-degradable plastics 
such as PET, PE, and PS into biodegradable counterparts, namely 
polyhydroxyalkanoates  (PHA),  have  been  previously  reported 
[ 128 , 144–148 ]. Another recent advance in biochemical recycling is 
the use of various organisms ( e.g. microorganisms, algae, worms, 
insect  larvae)  capable  of  converting  the  complex  polymers  into 
simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water [ 114 , 136 , 149–155 ]. 
For instance, Yang et al. reported that mealworms (Tenebrio Moli- 
tor) fed solely on polystyrene blocks for 16 days were able to con- 
vert up to 47.7% of the ingested carbon into carbon dioxide, while 
the remaining carbon was egested as feces [151] . In another study, 
the fungi Aspergillus niger and the bacteria Streptomyces sp. de- 
graded respectively 26.17% and 46.7% in weight of LDPE powder 
(53–75 μm)  after  6  months  [154] .  These  processes  occurring  at 
very low rates and the prerequisite of keeping the organisms alive 
for extended amounts of time are enormous challenges for indus- 
trial applications [149] . 

Enzymatic  degradation  of  plastics  is  another  interesting  area 
of  research  in  the  ﬁeld  of  biochemical  engineering.  Various  en- 
zymes such as cutinases, laccases, lipases, and enzymes involved 
in lignin metabolism have already been reported to be involved in 
the degradation of polymers [ 128 , 135 , 136 , 156–173 ]. It is stated that 
non-hydrolyzable polymers are signiﬁcantly harder to break down 
compared to hydrolyzable polymers [128] . Very recently, microbial 
hydrolases  capable  of  modifying  or  degrading  plastics  have  also 
been reported [ 114 , 124 ]. In their 2018 study, Austin et al. character- 
ized a newly discovered enzyme that can digest highly crystalline 
PET [169] . The authors have improved the enzyme’s PET degrada-

tion capacity and demonstrate that it can also degrade an impor- 
tant PET replacement, polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate, provid- 
ing new opportunities for bio-based plastics recycling [169] . Knott 
et al. make use of a recently discovered two-enzyme system for 
polyethylene  terephthalate  (PET)  deconstruction,  which  employs 
one  enzyme  to  convert  the  polymer  into  soluble  intermediates 
and  another  enzyme  to  produce  the  constituent  PET  monomers 
(MHETase)  [172] .  The  authors’  2020  study  on  the  characteriza- 
tion  of  the  MHETase  enzyme  and  synergy  of  the  two-enzyme 
PET depolymerization system may inform enzyme cocktail-based 
strategies for plastics upcycling [172] . It should be noted that cur- 
rent studies mainly involve enzymes acting on the high-molecular- 
weight  polymers  of  PET  and  ester-based  PUR.  Regrettably,  even 
the  best  PUR-  and  PET-active  enzymes  and  microorganisms  cur- 
rently researched still have moderate turnover rates [143] . Wei and 
Zimmermann state that the performance of the enzymes still re- 
quires  substantial  improvements  for  the  eﬃcient  degradation  of 
post-consumer PET plastic waste in an industrial process [174] . On 
the other hand, Tournier et al. recently reported a highly eﬃcient 
and optimized enzyme outperforms all PET hydrolases reported so 
far [158] . The authors describe an improved PET hydrolase that ul- 
timately  achieves, over 10 h,  a  minimum of  90  percent PET  de- 
polymerization into monomers, with a productivity of 16.7 gs of 
terephthalate per liter per hour (200 gs per kilogram of PET sus- 
pension, with an enzyme concentration of 3 mg per gram of PET) 
[158] . Nevertheless, no highly eﬃcient enzymes acting on the high- 
molecular-weight polymers of PE, PP, PS, PA, PVC, and ether-based 
PU are known yet [143] . Different points stated above considerably 
limit the current application potential of biochemical recycling pro- 
cesses. Hopefully, with further research and advancements, these 
types of enzymes will have the potential for complete biological 
recycling of various plastics in the future [ 124 , 143 ]. 

3.3. Recycling of solid plastic wastes 

In global waste management schemes, four main techniques are 
being implemented for the recycling of plastics. These are namely 
primary recycling (closed-loop), secondary recycling (mechanical), 
tertiary recycling (chemical), and quaternary recycling (energy re- 
covery through incineration) [ 3 , 7 ]. The only remaining obvious al- 
ternative to these techniques is the landﬁlling of the SPW. Potential 
uses  of  different  processing  techniques  for  the  recycling  of  SPW 
and their corresponding products can be seen in Fig. 9 . Primary 
recycling refers to the recycling of pre-consumer residues whereas 
mechanical (secondary) recycling refers to recovering plastics via 
mechanical processes. 

3.3.1. Primary recycling (closed-loop) 

Primary  recycling  (closed-loop)  is  deﬁned  as  reusing  a  prod- 
uct without altering it. In the case of plastics recycling, this cor- 
responds to the recycling of pre-consumer residues and it is also 

referred to as re-extrusion [ 7 , 27 , 175 ]. The pre-consumer residues 
are created either in the polymer production phase or when trans- 
forming the polymers into the ﬁnal product [176] . Primary recy- 
cling, which requires an uncontaminated and singly used plastic 
input,  constitutes  a  signiﬁcant  amount  of  current  recycling  pro- 
cesses [3] . The pre-consumer (post-industrial) products are mostly 
well-identiﬁed, clean, and homogeneous since they generally con- 
sist of a unique feedstock [175] . The primary recycling of process 
scrap from industry has the important advantage of avoiding sort- 
ing and transportation costs. For these reasons, it is already very 
well established in the industry [ 27 , 175 ]. Even in the year 2002, 
95% of the process scrap (a total of 250,0 0 0 tonnes) was primarily 
recycled in the UK [177] . However primary recycling also has some 
disadvantages which prevent it from being widespread outside the 
industry. The main drawback of primary recycling is the require- 
ment of near-pristine input in the form of uncontaminated, singly 
used plastics [ 27 , 175 ]. Thus, it is reported that primary recycling is 
not suitable for SPW obtained from MSW because it cannot process 
contaminated mixed plastics [178] . This greatly reduces the usage 
area of the technique. Secondly, another prevalent problem with 
primary recycling is the stability of the end-product [ 27 , 175 , 179 ]. 
Continuously reprocessing recycled polymers have been reported 
to have drastic effects on the mechanical properties of the post- 
recycled product [180] . This greatly reduces the total number of re- 
processing cycles, which translates to a substantial obstacle in the 
long-run [3] . Lopez et al. state that the strain-at-break (the percent 
of the length that a sample can be stretched before the sample 
breaks) value of virgin PET reduces from 42% to 0.7% after only the 
ﬁfth cycle of extrusion [181] . Primary recycling is, although very 
valuable, not a part of the scope of this review. 

3.3.2. Energy recovery (incineration) 

The  incineration  of  SPW  is  classiﬁed  as  the  energy  recovery 
route and it is also termed as quaternary recycling [ 7 , 182 , 183 ]. The 
experimentally  measured  energy  content  of  HDPE,  PP,  and  LDPE 
are all above 40 MJ/kg, which is comparable with the 44.5 MJ/kg 
caloriﬁc value of heating oil [ 184 , 185 ]. Onwudili et al. state that the 
caloriﬁc value of PS is lower ( < 40 MJ/kg) than polyoleﬁnic plastics 
due to the aromatic structure which has lower combustion energy 
than the aliphatic hydrocarbon [42] . PET and PVC have the lowest 
caloriﬁc value (below 30 MJ/kg) due to the presence of oxygen acid 
in PET and chlorine in PVC [ 42 , 186 ]. At ﬁrst glance, these types 
of  secondary  fuels,  like  plastic  waste,  might  seem  like  a  plausi- 
ble cheap source of energy. However, it should be kept in mind 
that the incineration of plastics introduces the need for costly pol- 
lution control measures, which are highly regulated in Europe by 
the EU Hazardous Waste Incineration Directive [176] . The incinera- 
tion of plastics also raises serious environmental and public health 
concerns [184] . Based on the type and composition of the plastic 
waste, incineration can lead to the emission of toxic volatile or- 

10 

O. Dogu, M. Pelucchi, R. Van de Vijver et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100901 

ganic compounds (VOCs) such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, fu- 
rans, dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzo- p -dioxins (PCDDs), polychlo- 
rinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), cyano compounds, and halogenated 
gasses [187] . Zhou et al. state that incineration is a low-value op- 
tion,  even  though  it  has  been  the  conventional  processing  tech- 
nique for high volumes of polymeric wastes [6] . In summary, the 
energy recovery route is less favorable both from an environmen- 
tal and economic point of view but can be a good option for the 
residue from a plastic waste sorting plant. The waste management 
hierarchy declared by the EU Waste Framework Directive (WFD- 
2008/98/EC) also clearly states that the recycling option should be 
favored against the energy recovery option, which in turn should 
be favored against the disposal option. 

3.3.3. Limitations of mechanical recycling 

Another frequently used waste management technique is me- 
chanical  recycling  (the  secondary  recycling  technique),  which  is 
reprocessing SPW into secondary raw materials and products by 
physical means [ 7 , 188 ]. This technique is one of the most widely 
practiced recycling methods all around the world since it requires 
relatively simple technologies and thus it represented a good start- 
ing point for recycling plastics universally. One of the critical draw- 
backs of  mechanical recycling is the inevitable involvement of a 
series of treatments and preparation steps [188] . In addition, me- 
chanical recycling is only economically feasible when costly sep- 
aration  steps  are  not  required,  i.e.  when  the  waste  is  not  com- 
plex  and  not  contaminated  [175] .  It  should  be  noted  that  a  full 
separation of individual components in SPW is rarely carried out 
since  it  is  very  burdensome  and  costly  [189] .  This  clearly  limits 
the frequency and usage areas of mechanical recycling. It should 
be mentioned that one speciﬁc type of waste which is quite suit- 
able for mechanical recycling is pre-consumer plastic waste as de- 
scribed in Section 3.2.1. As mentioned above, the recycling of pre- 
consumer  plastic  waste  is  deﬁned  as  primary  recycling  (closed- 
loop). In contrast, the post-consumer residues are a mixture of dif- 
ferent plastics generally contaminated with dirt or other residues 
[176] . This makes mechanical recycling far more diﬃcult and eco- 
nomically  unsustainable.  Moreover,  mechanically  recycled  prod- 
ucts often have reduced mechanical properties in practice, which 
strongly limits their applicability and market demand [188] . Singh 
et al. state that the mechanical recycling of virgin plastic material 
can only be done 2 to 3 times because, after every recycling cy- 
cle, the strength of the plastic material is reduced gradually due to 
thermal degradation [7] . 

In comparison to mechanical recycling, chemical recycling is a 
steadily growing route which has high potential even for heteroge- 
neous  and  contaminated  plastic  waste  material  [11] .  Among  dif- 
ferent  chemical  recycling  methods,  pyrolysis  and  gasiﬁcation  are 
the most promising technologies for plastic waste feeds which are 
complicated to be recycled mechanically and are also diﬃcult to 
depolymerize. According to Rahimi and Garcia [3] , chemical recy- 
cling has the potential to positively impact the economy introduc- 
ing major savings. However, earlier attempts in the ’80s and ’90s 
failed miserably because of the presence of impurities, feedstock 
availability, logistics, corrosion, and poor economics. 

3.3.4. Chemical versus mechanical recycling of solid plastic wastes 

Chemical recycling is used interchangeably with the term ter- 
tiary recycling. It covers processes that convert end-of-life plastic 
materials into smaller molecules (low molecular weight products 
(LMWPs)) [190] . These products can then be used as a feedstock 
for the production of new petrochemicals and plastics [ 7 , 191–193 ]. 
These processes have been termed as ‘chemical‘ since the chem- 
ical structure of the polymer is altered during the process [175] . 
Tertiary recycling aims to overcome the disadvantages associated 

with primary and secondary recycling techniques which were in- 
troduced  above.  Primary  and  secondary  recycling  techniques  re- 
quire  the  identiﬁcation,  separation,  and  sorting  of  waste  mate- 
rial using numerous operations. The strong heterogeneity of SPW 
renders it very diﬃcult to be recycled using mechanical recycling 
techniques [175] . For example, the application of these techniques 
proves to be effectively impossible for certain feedstock types such 
as  multilayer  packaging  [194] .  Chemical  recycling  can  overcome 
these problems to a certain extent with the ability to use heteroge- 
neous SPW as a raw material thus contributing greatly to a circu- 
lar economy. It should still be noted that although chemical recy- 
cling is better equipped to tackle the heterogeneity of SPW, it does 
not mean that there is no challenge. In fact, different plastics will 
still pose different reactivity, and the synergy between the differ- 
ent components is little studied. Product separation can also be a 
potential issue. 

The contribution of chemical recycling to the circular economy 
is established by eliminating waste and generating the raw mate- 
rials from which the plastics are originally made, therefore closing 
the ‘loop’ [7] . This, in turn, helps in keeping the same products and 
materials in use and thus aiding in the regeneration of natural sys- 
tems. In order to increase speciﬁc product selectivities and process 
eﬃciencies, designing chemical recycling friendly polymers is also 
compelling [195] . Research in design and recycling ﬁelds should go 
hand in hand with each other to get the most productivity out of 
both ﬁelds in the shortest amount of time [ 195 , 196 ]. Very recently, 
researchers have started designing and manufacturing completely 
recyclable polymers in different research groups around the world 
[196–202] . 

Compared  to  combustion,  pyrolysis  and  gasiﬁcation  require  a 
lower process temperature [50] . From an environmental point of 
view, pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation also provide an alternative solution 
to landﬁlling and as a result, they can potentially reduce GHGs and 
CO 
2  emissions [175] .  In  addition,  the  scale  of  pyrolysis  plants is 
considered to be more ﬂexible than incineration plants [203] . Cza- 
jczy ´nska et al. state that one of the great advantages of pyrolysis 
and gasiﬁcation is that many types of raw material can be used, in- 
cluding industrial and domestic residues [50] . Pyrolysis and gasiﬁ- 
cation also have additional economic advantages as they do not re- 
quire as many feedstock pre-treatment steps as other waste treat- 
ment methods [41] . On top of this, the products of fuels with high 
caloriﬁc values or useful chemicals can be easily marketed and po- 
tentially be sold with a proﬁt. Other possible applications of dif- 
ferent pyrolysis product fractions are also being investigated at an 
ever-increasing pace. Recently, Rodríguez et al. investigated differ- 
ent possibilities of using the wax fraction of the pyrolysis prod- 
ucts by feeding it to reﬁnery units for fuel production [ 204 , 205 ]. 
Besides, the process handling for pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation is con- 
sidered much easier and ﬂexible than common recycling methods 
since it does not need an intense sorting process, thus it is con- 
sidered to be less labor-intensive as still not every step in sorting 
is fully automated [185] . Another operational advantage is the uti- 
lization of residual output of char, which can be used as a fuel or 
feedstock for other petrochemical processes [175] . Faravelli et al. 
[206] suggest that the pyrolysis of plastic mixtures, in which dif- 
ferent polymers are decomposed together, may also offer a further 
advantage: single polymer chains in a mixture can partially decom- 
pose  at  different  temperatures  [206] .  Hence,  several  researchers 
conclude that the decomposition of mixed polymer feedstock and 
the separation of the product stream can be potentially combined 
employing a stepwise pyrolysis process at moderate temperatures 
[206–208] . 

Different  types  of  plastics  can  be  better  suited  for  particu- 
lar  types  of  chemical  recycling  techniques.  The  optimal  decision 
should  also  be  based  on  the  desired  product  spectrum.  For  in- 
stance, polyoleﬁns are considered to be an ideal feedstock for py- 

11

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100901 

rolysis  [209] .  With  current  knowledge,  it  is  remarkably  arduous 
to convert polyoleﬁns directly to their monomers, while degrad- 
ing them into valuable hydrocarbon products is effortless. The ob- 
tained product distribution employs a very wide range of carbon 
numbers.  Depending  on  the  choice  of  the  reactor  and  operating 
conditions, the product distribution can be targeted towards a cer- 
tain fraction like gas, oils, or waxes. For instance, pyrolysis of PE 
can be directed towards waxes and paraﬃns at low temperatures, 
while gasses and light oils can be obtained using high tempera- 
tures.  Furthermore,  the  produced  oligomers  can  be  subjected  to 
different processing steps to be converted into high-added-value 
building blocks [210] . Some polymers like PS, PA, PET, and PMMA 
are more suited for producing monomers using chemical recycling. 
Low-temperature pyrolysis of PS yields styrene and its oligomers, 
while  PA  and  PET  produce  their  monomers,  ε-caprolactam,  and 
terephthalic acid (TPA) respectively. High-temperature pyrolysis of 
PMMA yields its monomer methyl methacrylate. Mechanical recy- 
cling of PMMA is especially problematic since the resulting prod- 
uct often does not lead to the desired optical properties [ 211 , 212 ]. 
Chemical  recycling  of  polymer  mixtures  becomes  very  compli- 
cated  because  of  the  mixing  and  synergistic  effects.  Addition- 
ally,  it  is  reported  that  the  presence  of  some  polymers,  such  as 
PET and PVC, in the mixture are detrimental to the process and 
product [209] . Thermal degradation of PVC  produces chlorinated 
hydrocarbons  and  hydrogen  chloride,  which  causes  corrosion  in 
the reactor and renders the oil halogenated [ 209 , 213–215 ]. Ther- 
mal  degradation  of  PET  produces  phthalic  acids,  which  deterio- 
rate the oil quality and clogs piping systems [209] . Furthermore, 
the  co-pyrolysis  of  PET  and  PVC  enhances  the  formation  of  or- 
ganic chlorine [216] . Solvent extraction methods such as glycoly- 
sis, methanolysis, or hydrolysis, can completely depolymerize PET 
into  its  monomer  constituents  terephthalic  acid  (TPA),  dimethyl 
terephthalate  (DMT),  bis(hydroxylethylene)  terephthalate  (BHET), 
and ethylene glycol (EG) [ 11 , 209 ]. Methanolysis of PET mainly pro- 
duces DMT and EG, and it involves methanol treatment in the tem- 
perature range of 180–280 °C using pressures of 20–40 atm [11] . 
Hydrolysis  (hydrothermal  liquefaction)  breaks  down  PET  mainly 
into TPA and EG using water at high temperature and pressure [11] . 
PET  glycolysis  is  an  already  established  chemical  recycling  tech- 
nology in the industry worldwide [217] . In addition to the forma- 
tion of monomers (mainly BHET), glycolysis of PET also produces 
specialized  oligomeric  products  such  as  α, ω-dihydroxy  materials 
(polyols) [11] . Depending on the end-use target for the chemically 
recycled  product,  different  solvent  extraction  approaches  can  be 
preferred  over  other  chemical  recycling  techniques  for  the  recy- 
cling of PET[ 218 , 219 ]. 

3.3.5. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) 

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a different kind of thermo- 
chemical recycling technique, which involves the conversion of car- 
bonaceous feedstock into oil, gas, and char in the presence of sub- 
critical or supercritical water [220–223] . Under subcritical or su- 
percritical  conditions  water  retains  an  immense  amount  of  en- 
ergy that can break the carbon-carbon bond of organic components 
[224] .  During  the  HTL  process,  a  series  of  hydrothermal  crack- 
ing, hydrolysis, free radical reaction, nucleophilic substitution, and 
cyclization reactions occur in the reaction medium that converts 
the  waste  plastics  matrix  into  monomers  or  chemical  feedstock 
[224] . In the HTL processes, water can serve as a solvent, catalyst, 
or reactant [ 222 , 225 , 226 ]. Fluids having a temperature and pres- 
sure higher than their critical temperature (Tc) and critical pres- 
sure (Pc) are deﬁned as supercritical ﬂuids [227–229] . The physi- 
cal and chemical properties of aqueous solutions in a supercritical 
state, with a temperature above 374 °C and pressure higher than 
22.1 MPa, is dramatically different compared to water at ambient 
temperature and atmospheric pressure [ 228 , 229 ]. For instance, the 

dielectric constant of supercritical water (SCW) is as low as polar 
organic solvents [ 228 , 230 ]. Additionally, possessing a higher den- 
sity  and  ionic  product  can  promote  the  solvation  of  compounds 
in the supercritical ﬂuids, while high diffusivity and low viscosity 
can promote faster mass transfer since the reactants can penetrate 
into the polymer structure more easily [ 220 , 227 , 231 ]. Accordingly, 
the liquefaction reaction rate is believed to be controlled by the 
rate of diffusion [227] . Employing low temperatures or pressures 
in HTL results in the production of bio-oils with high viscosity but 
high temperatures and pressures result in gasiﬁcation of the mate- 
rials [220] . Unlike pyrolysis, the heating rate in HTL was reported 
to have an insigniﬁcant effect on product distribution [220] . On the 
other hand, residence time control is critical in maintaining a bal- 
ance between heavy oil and light oil yields to avoid hydrocarbon 
gas formation [220] . 

Compared to pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation, hydrothermal process- 
ing of plastics at SCW conditions has only scarcely been investi- 
gated and is starting to attract more interest in recent years. Al- 
though HTL is the dominant area of research, investigations on su- 
percritical  gasiﬁcation  and  carbonization  also  exist  [ 220 , 232 ].  To 
begin with, Watanabe et al. used SCW for the liquefaction of LDPE 
and obtained a relatively low oil yield (30 wt%) at 400 °C and 0.5 h 
of  reaction  time  [233] .  Moriya  and  Enomoto  used  SCW  for  con- 
verting HDPE into oil with a yield of 90.2 wt% [228] . Su et al. re- 
ported that the oil yield of degradation of PE to oils in SCW was 
more than 90 wt.% under a reaction temperature of 460 °C, a res- 
2 O/PE ratio of 6 [234] . It was de- 
idence time of 1 min, and an H 
clared that the H 
2 O/PE ratio not only affects the yield of products 
but also changes the composition of oil products [234] . Chen et al. 
used SCW for the liquefaction of PP and obtained the highest oil 
yield  (91  wt%)  at  425  °C  and  2–4 h  reaction  time  or  at  450  °C 
and 0.5–1 h reaction time [225] . The highest naphtha yield ( ∼80 
wt%)  was  reported  to  be  obtained  at  425  °C  and  4 h  or  at  450 
°C and 1 h reaction time [225] . Pedersen et al. studied the super- 
critical hydrothermal reaction of nine plastic wastes (PBT, PC, PET, 
PLA , PMMA , POM, PPO, PVA , and SB) at a temperature of 400 °C 
and a pressure of 25 MPa and found out that the SB liquefaction 
rate reached 80.8% [235] . Ramdoss and Tarrer investigated the HTL 
of  commingled  post-consumer  plastics  in  a  tubing  bomb  micro- 
reactor with an operating temperature of 500 °C, hydrogen pres- 
sure  of  790 kPa  cold,  and  reaction  times  of  0–30 min  [236] .  The 
authors reported that in optimum conditions total conversion as 
high as 100%, together with gas yields up to 70%, and oil yields 
as high as 60% were obtained [236] . Williams and Slaney studied 
chemical recycling of 5 different plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, and PET) 
under both nitrogen (pyrolysis at 10 MPa) and hydrogen pressure 
(liquefaction at 18 MPa) at 500 °C using a batch autoclave reactor 
and reported the product distributions [237] . Liu et al. investigated 
the catalytic cracking of PET in hot compressed water at a tem- 
perature range of 220–300  °C and found the maximum yield of 
terephthalic acid to be 90.5 wt% [238] . Zhang et al. used a con- 
tinuous SCW reactor to study the degradation of PE to produce oil 
at 500–550 °C and discovered that the oil yield was maximized at 
79% at 530 °C [239] . Dai et al. utilized post-consumer PU foam in 
SCW HTL and reported that the yield of TDA reached 72 wt% at 
250 °C for 30 min reaction time [240] . In Iwaya et al.’s 2006 study, 
nylon 6 was decomposed into LMWPs in sub- and supercritical wa- 
ter between 300 °C to 400 °C, under 35 MPa, for reaction times of 
5–60 min [241] . The highest yield of ɛ -caprolactam was reported 
to  be  85  wt%  [241] .  Liu  et  al.  utilized  SCW  gasiﬁcation  experi- 
ments for fuel gas production using ABS in the temperature range 
of 450 °C to 700 °C and a pressure of 23 MPa [242] . The authors de- 
termined the optimal reaction condition for monomer recovery as

subcritical HTL is not able to cope with polyoleﬁns and PS, how- 
ever, it represents an interesting approach to chemical recycling of 
heteroatom-containing synthetic polymers [243] . 

To  conclude,  HTL  has  different  advantages  and  disadvantages 
compared to  other  SPW  management strategies.  Firstly,  it  is  de- 
clared  that  condensation  and  coking  reactions  are  restrained  in 
HTL  processes  [ 234 , 239 , 244–246 ].  It  is  also  stated  that  HTL  has 
the ability to process unsorted, mixed, and organic contaminated 
plastics  [ 224 , 243 , 247 ].  The  water  phase  reaction  medium  makes 
the  HTL  process  superior  in  processing  high  moisture  content 
feedstocks [220] . HTL was found to need large quantities of wa- 
ter which can be considered as an important disadvantage [248] . 
The process being conducted at high temperatures and pressures 
means  that  it  is  also  highly  energy-intensive  [248] .  Another  im- 
portant drawback of the HTL process is that it requires high tech- 
nology  because  of  high-pressure  requirements,  which  translates 
into specialized instruments and materials in real-life applications 
[244] .  Besides  practical  application  problems,  the  high-pressure 
operation also raises the investment costs of HTL units [245] . For 
the same reasons, scale-up towards the industrial-scale does not 
seem straightforward. Accordingly, pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation pro- 
cesses are simpler to design and will require less optimization for 
high-eﬃciency implementation. 

3.3.6. Challenges and opportunities for pyrolysis based chemical 
recycling 

Pyrolysis  is  the  most  promising  route  today  of  all  the  differ- 
ent chemical recycling techniques. Pyrolysis is deﬁned as degrada- 
tion by heating of the feedstock material to moderate temperatures 
(30 0–70 0 °C, depending on the feedstock and reactor type) in an 
inert and oxygen-free environment. In the pyrolysis process, ther- 
mal degradation of long-chain molecules (thermochemical decom- 
position) can be accomplished in the presence of a catalyst (cat- 
alytic pyrolysis) or without (thermal pyrolysis). Different types of 
pyrolysis differing in reaction times have also been developed as 
fast, catalytic fast, intermediate, slow, vacuum pyrolysis [50] . In the 
pyrolysis process, the long chains of the organic materials degrade 
into smaller and less complex molecules by controlling the heat 
ﬂow and pressure of the operation [41] . Pyrolysis of plastics pro- 
duces liquids (condensable vapors or oil), solids (char), and gasses 
(non-condensables). The relative yields of these products are de- 
termined by the process conditions as well as the type and com- 
position  of  the  feedstock.  The  selection  of  the  reactor  type  and 
pyrolysis temperature are the two main factors that strongly af- 
fect product selectivities [190] . Ideally, a reactor conﬁguration that 
has excellent mass and heat transfer characteristics should be pre- 
ferred. Numerous types of reactors have been described in the lit- 

erature which were used in the pyrolysis of various plastic wastes. 
These include ﬁxed bed reactors, batch or semi-batch reactors, ro- 
tary kilns, ﬂuidized bed reactors, microwave-assisted reactors, and 
some innovative solutions like plasma or solar reactors [ 50 , 203 ]. 
On the other hand, for plastics pyrolysis research, thermogravimet- 
ric analyzers, micro-reactors, and batch laboratory reactors are the 
most  commonly  used  technologies  [249] .  Contrary  to  large-scale 
operations, pyrolysis technology also allows eﬃcient downscaling 
to small plants, even offering the possibility to create mobile plants 
[ 209 , 250 , 251 ]. The advantage of this can be realized in waste con- 
centration sites where the feedstock is abundant but the transport 
costs are high [209] . 

Czajczy ´nska et al. showed that pyrolysis can provide, in some 
cases,  an  opportunity  for  transforming  materials  of  low-energy- 
density into liquid energy carriers of high-energy-density, recov- 
ering, at the same time, speciﬁc high-value chemicals [50] . In gen- 
eral practice, pyrolysis is optimized to produce a high oil yield of 
(or pyrolysis oil) which can be upgraded to transportation grade 
fuels and other ﬁne chemicals [6] . Additionally, it is important to 
note  that  the  relative  yields  of  pyrolysis  products  show  similar 
trends  (such  as  increasing  or  decreasing  certain  fractions  of  py- 
rolysis products) while different process conditions are being uti- 
lized [252] . Firstly, increasing the pyrolysis temperature results in 
an  increase  in  the  gas  fraction  and  a  decrease  in  the  wax  frac- 
tion amount [253–256] . Secondly, an increase in residence times 
results in a slight decrease in the wax fraction [253–255] , despite 
a wide disparity in reactor types, materials, and ﬂuidizing agents. 
The aforementioned decrease in the wax fraction is induced by the 
cracking of the wax, leading to an aromatic fraction. 

Table 4 shows that the volatile matter for all plastics is very 
high, while the ash content is low. These characteristics indicate 
that plastics have a high potential to produce a large amount of 
liquid oil through the pyrolysis process. According to Zhou et al., 
all the volatile matter present in the feedstock can be, in princi- 
ple, pyrolyzed to condensable vapor fraction [6] . As synthetic poly- 
mers  contain  highly  volatile  matter  with  negligible  ﬁxed  carbon 
and  inorganics  like  ash,  a  high  oil  yield  ( > 90  wt%)  can  be  ex- 
pected.  The  high  potential  of  polymers  as  a  chemical  feedstock 
is  further  conﬁrmed  when  the  elemental  analysis  results  shown 
in Table 5 are combined with the proximate analysis results. Re- 
markably high carbon content together with next to non-existent 
oxygen  content  makes  polymers  perfect  candidates  for  chemical 
recycling.  However,  further challenges can be  encountered when 
commercial polymers containing additives such as ﬁllers, plasticiz- 
ers, colorants, and ﬂame retardants are being pyrolyzed. In those 
cases, the yield of char increases due to an intrinsic increase in 
the ﬁxed carbon content [6] . Additionally, contamination of SPW

( e.g. food residues) will also strongly alter product yields of pyrol- 
ysis/gasiﬁcation processes. A representative process ﬂowchart for 
producing  aviation  fuel  using  SPW  as  feedstock  can  be  seen  in 
Fig.  10 .  As  the  ﬁgure  hints,  by  using  different  processing  tech- 
niques, yields of various fractions can be adjusted according to spe- 
ciﬁc needs. 

Somoza-Tornos  et  al.’s  2020  study  explicitly  quantiﬁed  the 
economic  and  environmental  beneﬁts  of  ethylene  recovery  from 
polyethylene plastics using process modeling coupled with Life Cy- 
cle  Assessment  (LCA)  [29] .  Their  analysis  compared  PE  pyrolysis 
against both, the business as usual (BAU) process for the produc- 
tion of ethylene and two conventional end-of-life alternatives for 
the treatment of waste PE [29] . In the pyrolysis versus BAU com- 
parison for producing ethylene, the total cost of production per kg 
of ethylene was calculated as 0.386 € [29] , which corresponds to 
half  of  the  cost  of  the  BAU  process  (0.835  €)  reported  by  Spal- 
lina et al. [268] . On top of this, the environmental performance of 
the PE pyrolysis also presented clear advantages over the BAU pro- 
cess. The positive environmental effect was especially signiﬁcant in 
the category of resource scarcity, where a negative impact was ob- 
served. For the case of end-of-life processes comparison, PE pyroly- 
sis was calculated to have better environmental performance com- 
pared to both landﬁlling and incineration. The authors attributed 
this mainly to the revalorization of waste PE into multiple valu- 
able products [29] . A comparison of GHG emissions in targeting the 
production of different products (monomer or other types of fuels) 
via pyrolysis of waste PE can also be made. Somoza-Tornos et al. 
2 -eq/kg of waste PE for producing ethy- 
[29] reported 0.56 kg CO 
lene, where Benavides et al. [269] reported 0.31 kg CO 
2 -eq/kg of 
waste PE for the production of naphtha, and Faraca et al. [270] re- 
ported around 0.5 kg CO 
2 -eq/kg of waste PE for the production of 
fuel-oil. 

Different  process  performance  estimates  for  producing  virgin 
polymer  and  gasoline  are  compared  with  various  SPW  recycling 
technologies in Table 6 (detailed assumptions used in the calcu- 
lations are provided in the original article by Chen et al. [225] ). 
It should be noted that the values presented in Table 6 are com- 
parisons on the basis of neat PP production. To begin with, com- 
pared to virgin polymer production, all recycling technologies pre- 
sented in Table 6 show substantial improvements in terms of both 
economic and environmental concerns. Secondly, even though the 
energy input to the incineration of SPW is extremely low, the ex- 
tremely high GHG emissions of the process immediately diminish 
the feasibility of this approach within the circular economy prin- 
ciples. As detailed in Section 3.3.2 Incineration of SPW raises ad- 
ditional environmental and public health concerns such as the re- 
lease of various toxic compounds. Thirdly, although mechanical re- 
cycling is already more widespread compared to other chemical re- 
cycling alternatives, its high process energy input value might be 
discouraging for further expansion. Mechanical recycling becomes 
costly, complex, and more labor-intensive because of the unavoid- 
able sorting requirements. Furthermore, compared to pyrolysis, the 
process energy input is lower while the energy eﬃciency is higher 
in both solvent extraction and HTL processes. For the case of sol- 
vent extraction, the detailed environmental assessment of the use 
of potentially harmful solvents should be researched further. Addi- 
tionally, practical challenges in large-scale implementations of the 
process and the optimization of the scale-up possibilities should be 
addressed. Important economic and environmental challenges fac- 
ing the large-scale implementation of HTL are the consumption of 
large quantities of water, high technology requirements because of 
high-pressure operation, investment and operational costs, and re- 
search needed for optimization and scale-up. On the other hand, 
compared to other technologies reported in Table 6 , the pyrolysis

of SPW stands out as a promising technology showing a balanced 
and relatively high performance in all areas (process energy input, 
energy eﬃciency, and GHG emissions). Minimal direct GHG emis- 
sions (N/A in Table 6 refers to close to zero direct GHG emissions) 
resulting  from  the  process  is  an  immense  environmental  advan- 
tage. The unmistakable advantage of pyrolysis lies in its simplic- 
ity. As a result of this relative straightforwardness, pyrolysis will 
require comparatively less optimization for high-eﬃciency imple- 
mentation. Additionally, when judged against other chemical recy- 
cling technologies, the scale-up of pyrolysis towards the industrial- 
scale is more straightforward. Pyrolysis is already considered as a 
reasonably mature technology with numerous already functioning 
commercial plants for the pyrolysis of both biomass and plastics 
[ 284 , 285 ]. The gas fraction of the pyrolysis products can be used 
for energy recovery [209] . It is possible to separate and recircu- 
late the gas fraction back into the process to extract its energy for 
heating purposes, which will substantially reduce the reliance on 
external  heating  sources.  Overall,  pyrolysis  can  be  considered  to 
be simpler to design technology, a ﬂexible and suitable process for 
converting SPW that is diﬃcult to depolymerize. 

To conclude, in order to ﬁgure ways to overcome the complex 
challenges underlined in this section, a complete understanding of 
different aspects of pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation processes are imper- 
ative. A critical aspect is obtaining adequate models that can prop- 
erly identify, model, and optimize the distribution of the products 
obtained in the reactor. To achieve this goal, more competent de- 
tailed kinetic models together with accurate experimental results 
is crucial. 

3.3.7. Catalytic pyrolysis, ﬂuid catalytic cracking, and hydrocracking 

Buekens and Huang classify catalytic cracking into two groups: 
liquid  and  vapor  phase  [ 11 , 46 ].  Liquid  phase  processes  involve 
in-situ catalysis operation in which the  catalyst  is placed in the 
reactor  and  comes  in  direct  contact  with  the  molten  polymer 
phase. Vapor phase processes involve an independent catalytic bed 
(ex-situ or in-line) where the vapors formed during cracking are 
brought into contact with the catalyst. A critical challenge in de- 
veloping a continuous process for polymer pyrolysis is the contin- 
uous feeding of the feedstock in solid form into the reactor [249] . 
Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) offers a solution to this problem by 
dissolving the plastic feed in a suitable solvent, followed by pyrol- 
ysis of the solution [ 11 , 30 , 249 ]. On the other hand, hydrocracking 
involves adding hydrogen to the cracking process which is reported 
to result in higher product quality [178] . For all these applications, 
the use of solid catalysts such as silica-alumina, ZSM-5, zeolites, 
and mesoporous materials is possible [ 11 , 30 , 249 ]. 

To begin with, hydrocracking occurs at elevated hydrogen pres- 
sures, approximately 70 atm, and in the temperature range of 375–
500 °C [11] . The inorganic matter present in the SPW needs to be 
separated prior to hydrocracking since it is non-distillable. Thus, 
SPW is initially liqueﬁed via low-temperature pyrolysis and then 
ﬁltered  [ 11 , 178 ].  The  obtained  liquid  is  then  sent  over  to  a  cat- 
alyst bed. The catalyst’s role is characterized by the reduction of 
reaction temperature and an increase in the oil yield and quality 

(higher H/C ratio and lower aromatic content) [ 11 , 178 ]. Munir et al. 
state that the presence and type of catalyst do not have a signiﬁ- 
cant inﬂuence on the process at elevated temperatures [286] . Also 
in Ding et al.’s 1997 study, it was reported that the experiments for 
different types of catalysts revealed a high yield of paraﬃn [287] . 
The most important disadvantage of hydrocracking is the need for 
copious  amounts  of  hydrogen  as  it  is  quite  expensive  (roughly 
€2500 per tonne for electrically produced hydrogen) [ 11 , 178 ]. To- 
gether with the high operating pressures involved in the process, 
this translates to high capital and operational costs for the hydroc- 
racking process. Another reported challenge is the poisoning effect 
after the hydrocracking of PVC [178] . 

It has been agreed in the literature that the production of a nar- 
row distribution of products in the pyrolysis of polyoleﬁns involves 
a  signiﬁcant  challenge  [ 11 , 30 , 288 ].  In  this  respect,  the  use  of  a 
cracking catalyst was reported to favor the production of a narrow 
product distribution [289–292] . In addition to the reactor choice 
and  operating  conditions,  catalyst  properties  such  as  the  acidity 
and  pore  structure  also  play  a  decisive  role  in  the  product  dis- 
tribution obtained [ 11 , 30 , 249 ]. Multiple studies revealed that the 
selectivity of the process can be modiﬁed towards the production 
of light oleﬁns, gasoline, or diesel choosing a catalyst of suitable 
properties to shape selectivity [ 30 , 293–296 ]. For instance, it was 
reported that aromatic and naphthenic compounds are selectively 
formed in the presence of a classical FCC-catalyst [ 46 , 297 ]. Further- 
more, Schirmer et al. showed that the catalytic cracking of PE in- 
creases the gasoline yield [288] . Additionally, it was reported that 
the use of an acid catalyst may reduce the pyrolysis temperature, 
which will, in turn, reduce the energy consumption and total op- 
erating  cost  of  the  overall  process  [ 291 , 298–304 ].  On  the  other 
hand, catalytic cracking also involves several drawbacks. Carbona- 
ceous  deposits  and  inorganic  materials  can  easily  deactivate  the 
catalyst and block its pores [ 11 , 30 , 249 ]. As a direct result of this 
challenge, catalytic pyrolysis is very sensitive to the contamination 
of the feedstock [178] . Extensive pore blockage may even lead to 
the permanent deactivation of a large number of active sites [11] . 
Additionally, the chloride and nitrogen-containing components in 
the SPW can deactivate the catalyst easily [178] . In order to reduce 
deactivation,  intensive  pre-treatment  steps,  which  translates  into 
extra costs, are quite often required. Catalyst regeneration, which 
cannot  be  avoided  even  in  the  best-case  scenario,  increases  the 
process complexity and total operating cost of the overall process. 
Furthermore, developing an optimum catalyst proves to be burden- 
some because of the bulky nature of the polymers [11] . In general, 
this issue of immense molecular size translates into low catalyst 
activity and severe coking problems [289] . Lastly, the absence of 
an optimum reactor technology to employ catalytic fast pyrolysis 
is another major bottleneck in industrial applications [4] . 

In  order  to  overcome  these  challenges,  the  underlying  chem- 
istry of catalytic pyrolysis of SPW should be completely unraveled. 
However,  the  introduction  of  a  catalyst  in  the  reaction  medium 
further complicates the underlying chemistry of an already com- 
plex process. It is advantageous to attempt to tackle the detailed

underlying  chemistry  of  catalytic  pyrolysis  only  after  a  satisfac- 
tory understanding of thermal pyrolysis is achieved. For this rea- 
son, the main focus of this text has been limited to the detailed 
kinetics  of  thermal  pyrolysis  processes.  Since  catalytic  pyrolysis 
will not be discussed in further detail in this work, the reader is 
kindly invited to examine already published reviews on the topic 
[ 2 , 30 , 41 , 175 , 185 , 249 , 305–309 ]. 

3.3.8. Challenges and opportunities for gasiﬁcation of plastics 

2 ), carbon dioxide (CO 

Gasiﬁcation  processes  can  convert  any  organic  solid  material 
(coal, biomass, plastics, and organic waste) into a gaseous mixture 
2 ), and 
of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H 
methane (CH 
4 ) via partial oxidation [310–312] . For very contam- 
inated waste or unsorted plastic waste gasiﬁcation is considered 
the most promising technology. The syngas mixture (H 
2 /CO) is the 
primary objective of gasiﬁcation processes and its value strongly 
2 /CO  ratio  as  different  downstream  processes 
depends  on  the  H 
require  different  H 
2 /CO  ratios.  Syngas  can  be  used  in  Fischer- 
Tropsch  processes  (FTS)  to  produce  fuels  and  chemicals,  or  con- 
verted to methanol via catalytic hydrogenation over Cu/ZnO cat- 
alysts,  providing  a  valuable  feedstock  to  produce,  among  others, 
gasoline, gasoline additives ( e.g. MTBE), formaldehyde, and acetic 
acid [ 313 , 314 ]. Within downstream catalytic processes, methanol- 
to-oleﬁn (MTO) represents a great opportunity for the industrial- 
scale implementation of the circular economy, as it allows to pro- 
duce new polymers from recycled SPW. 

Gasiﬁcation is typically carried out in the presence of pure oxy- 
gen or air and, steam, at temperatures of 70 0–150 0 °C and atmo- 
spheric pressure [ 315 , 316 ]. Similar to the observations on the prod- 
uct distribution in pyrolysis processes, the optimization of temper- 
2 O ratio), and 
ature, stoichiometry ( i.e. the equivalence ratio, O 
residence time allows targeting a speciﬁc H 
2 /CO ratio. In principle, 
the addition of steam allows higher hydrogen production ( Eq. (1) ) 
compared to pure oxygen or pure air gasiﬁcation ( Eq. (2) ).

Unfortunately, steam gasiﬁcation is endothermic ( Eq. (1) ), thus 
requiring anyway the addition of air or oxygen to provide the re- 

16 

quired  heat  through  an  exothermic  reaction  ( Eq.  (2) ).  From  the 
economic and environmental perspectives, gasiﬁcation in pure air 
decreases the costs of gas separation compared to steam gasiﬁca- 
tion, however, the presence of N 
2 in such a high-temperature envi- 
ronment triggers the production of harmful nitrogen oxides (NO x ), 
leading to NO x control issues and higher costs. In addition, air gasi- 
ﬁcation requires higher volumes, thus negatively impacting invest- 
ment costs. Overall, gasiﬁcation is a very well-established technol- 
ogy  and  the  recent  interest  in  its  use  for  biomass  conversion  is 
pushing the development of increasingly viable and sustainable so- 
lutions, such as the combination of gasiﬁcation with pyrolysis or 
combustion and the cogeneration of different products ( e.g. syn- 
gas, heat, and power) as summarized by Heidenreich and Foscolo 
[310] . 

Speciﬁcally for SPW gasiﬁcation, the production of high caloriﬁc 
value  fuel  gas  or  synthesis  gas  (syngas)  was  reported  in  many 
different  studies  starting  from  the  1970s  as  reviewed  by  Lopez 
and  co-workers  [310] .  Despite  receiving  less  attention  than  coal 
and biomass, SPW gasiﬁcation seems a promising route for chem- 
ical recycling [317–322] . Many studies have previously addressed 
the  gasiﬁcation  of  SPW,  as  well  as  mixtures  of  coal  or  biomass 
and  SPW,  in  ﬂuidized  bed  reactors  such  as  those  reported  by 
Poho ˇrelý et  al.  [323]  ( Fig.  11 (a))  and  by  Mastellone  and  Arena 
[324] ( Fig. 11 (b)). 

Air gasiﬁcation can be a viable solution for small/medium scale 
plants (1–100 kg/h) producing a fuel gas with a lower heating value 
(LHV) of ∼6–8 MJ/kg. Despite no extensive testing at larger scales 
than laboratory reactors have been performed, steam gasiﬁcation is 
capable of producing a H 
2 rich syngas (up to 18 wt%) with LHVs in 
the order of 15 MJ/kg. Issues in its implementation are mostly re- 
lated to its endothermic nature discussed above. In addition, high 
char  yields  necessitate  the  challenging  implementation  of  dual- 
stage gasiﬁers [325] , co-feeding fuels, and char to provide the re- 
quired  energy  to  the  process.  Erkiaga  et  al.  successfully  demon- 
strated the viability of syngas production from steam gasiﬁcation 
of PE in a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) [326] . Fig. 12 shows 
the basic principles of dual-stage gasiﬁcation as reported by Wilk 
and Hofbauer, together with the 100 kW pilot plant set up used for 
the steam gasiﬁcation of mixtures of SPW [325] . 

An additional challenge in steam gasiﬁcation is related to the 
high yields of tar such as PAHs and aromatics ( ∼100 g/m 3 ), pre-

rolysis) involving cracking reactions is responsible for the release 
of permanent (non-condensable; H 
3 , etc. ) and 
condensable  gasses  ( i.e.  tar)  from  the  solid  material.  A  complex 
network  of  exothermic  partial  oxidation  reactions  occurs  in  the 
gas  phase,  under  reducing  conditions.  Endothermic  cracking  can 
also occur in the gas phase. In addition to homogeneous gas-phase 
reactions of the volatiles, heterogeneous interactions between the 
solid residue (ash and char) and the gas phase products are re- 
sponsible for the conversion of the raw material into syngas, tar, 
and fuel gas. In the context of SPW, this is the case of PET, PVC, 
and polycarbonates which are forming a residual char fraction that 
can actively participate in the heterogeneous gasiﬁcation process. 

From a mathematical modeling perspective, such a multicom- 
ponent,  multiscale,  and  multiphase  problem  constitutes  a  major 
challenge [ 328 , 329 ]. Coupling a detailed gas-phase kinetic model 
describing partial oxidation reactions to the description of the py- 
rolytic thermal degradation of the solid feedstock is, therefore, nec- 
essary for an accurate description of selectivity towards gasiﬁcation 
products. 

Notwithstanding the challenges for the industrial-scale imple- 
mentation of SPW gasiﬁcation processes, the main diﬃculties in 
SPW gasiﬁcation and pyrolysis processes are associated with the 
variability  and  the  quality  of  the  feedstock.  As  pointed  out  by 
Lopez et al. [315] , the success of chemical recycling of SPW through 
pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation lies in ﬁnding the optimal balance be- 
tween the added value of the products and the process capability 
of dealing with highly variable and contaminated feedstocks. 

3.4. Micro-, meso-, and macro-pollutants from plastic processing and 
recycling 

Chemical  recycling  of  SPW  through  pyrolysis  and  gasiﬁcation 
processes  involves  the  formation  of  harmful  pollutants  in  the 
micro-, meso–, and macroscale. Over 30 years ago, Levin [330] re- 
ported  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  pyrolysis  and  combus- 
tion products of different plastic materials. Seven different poly- 
mers  were  considered:  acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene  (ABS),  ny- 
lons,  polyester,  polyethylene,  polystyrene,  polyvinylchloride,  and 
polyurethane foams. Within the 400 different thermal decomposi- 
tion products identiﬁed, a large fraction was found to be common 
among many of the plastics. 

In general terms different families of gas species are released 

from pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation processes of SPW:

2) Monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAH) like benzene and alkylben- 
zenes ( e.g. ethylbenzene, styrene, and toluene) represent valu- 
able  feedstocks  for  the  petrochemical  industry.  However,  the 
toxicity and carcinogenic nature of benzene, as well as that of 
oxygenated MAH ( e.g. benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, and phenol), 
pose some concern as to avoid release in the exhaust gasses 
from pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation processes. Products from the hy- 
drogenation of benzene like cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes 
can also be formed.

pyrene  (C 
higher molecular weight compounds can be directly released or 
can grow from small oleﬁns or MAHs through the hydrogen ab- 
straction carbon addition mechanism [327] . In addition to their 
toxicity, PAHs are known precursors of harmful particulate mat- 
ter whose formation should be also carefully evaluated.

venting its direct use in synthesis processes. Solutions such as co- 
feeding SPW and coal or biomass reduce tar yields but also deteri- 
orate the high H 

2 content of syngas. 

Excessive  formation  of  condensable  mono-aromatic  and  poly- 
aromatic hydrocarbons (tar) is generally an issue for SPW gasiﬁca- 
tion processes. From a fundamental kinetic perspective, increased 
tar yields are explained by a different nature of released volatiles 
compared  to  coal  and  biomasses.  PET  and  PS  can,  in  fact,  lead 
to the direct formation of primary tar. Gasiﬁcation of the former 
can lead to intermediates such as benzoic and benzoylformic acid 
formation and of styrene and allyl-benzenes from PS. The yields 
of such intermediates are strongly dependent on temperature and 
residence times. In addition, light volatiles such as alkanes, alkenes 
( e.g. ethylene), and alkynes ( e.g. acetylene) can be released from 
SPW mixtures. Acetylene, for example, is responsible for secondary 
tar growth via the classical Hydrogen Abstraction Carbon Addition 
(HACA) abstraction/radical addition mechanisms [327] . Intermolec- 
ular and intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions are also a tar forma- 
tion pathway speciﬁc to SPW kinetics. 

In general terms, the gasiﬁcation of a solid material involves a 
series of exothermic and endothermic steps [ 316 , 328 ]. After a ﬁrst 
heating and drying phase, a thermal decomposition step ( i.e. py-

4) Harmful heteroatoms containing compounds such as HCN and 
NOx can be generated at typical operating temperatures of air 
gasiﬁcation  ( T > 10 0 0 °C).  In  addition  to  the  nitrogen  content 
in the air, the nitrogen content of the starting polymers ( e.g. 
polyamides, ABS, and polyurethanes) is responsible for the for- 
mation of HCN which can be converted to NOx by interactions 
with oxygen. Low molecular weight oxygenated molecules ( e.g. 
methanol,  formaldehyde,  ethanol,  acrolein)  are  also  products 
from  SPW  recycling.  In  particular,  they  can  be  formed  either 
from PET polymer chain decomposition or from gas-phase in- 
teractions with molecular oxygen. While methanol and ethanol 
are  interesting  products  for  the  petrochemical  industry  ( e.g. 
methanol) and the transport sector ( e.g. ethanol), formaldehyde 
and acrolein are toxic compounds whose formation should be 
carefully monitored. 

5) Brominated  ﬂame  retardants  ( e.g.  tetrabromobisphenol  A 
(TBBA))  are  typically  included  in  the  formulation  of  plastic 
polymers for electronic application to comply with safety re- 
quirements. TBBA decomposes to gaseous mixtures of HBr and 
harmful pollutants such as brominated phenols posing serious 
concerns  about  the  release  of  brominated  dibenzo- p -dioxins 
(PBDDs) [331–333] . 

6) Sulfur oxides (SOx) can be formed from the decomposition and 
successive gas-phase oxidation of sulfur-containing gums resid- 
ual  in  SPW  or  from  speciﬁc  sulfur-containing  polymers  with 
high thermal stability ( e.g. poly(p-phenylene sulﬁde [334] ). 
7) Thermal decomposition of PVC involves the formation of large 
amounts of hydrogen chloride (HCl) that is a sensory and pul- 
monary  irritant.  Treatments  such  as  scrubbing  or  NaOH  ad- 
sorption allow removing HCl from the off-gasses. In addition, 
chlorine (Cl) is generally incompatible with downstream reﬁn- 
ery processes (catalyst deactivation, corrosion, etc. ). Challenges 
are therefore associated with the complete removal of chlorine 
(Cl) from SPW in the form of HCl. The presence of oxygen be- 
low stoichiometric conditions in air gasiﬁcation inhibits the for- 
mation  of  dioxins  compared  to  combustion  (complete  oxida- 
tion). HCl content in the produced syngas must be appropri- 
ately managed if a combustion unit for the generation of heat 
and power follows the gasiﬁcation process. 

The  production  of  Cl-containing  oil  in  the  form  of  chlori- 
nated  aromatic  ( e.g.  chlorobenzenes,  etc. )  or  aliphatic  ( e.g. 
chloromethanes,  chloroethanes,  etc. )  hydrocarbons  would 
indeed result in damages to the downstream process units, 
and,  if  used  in  combustion  systems,  in  the  production  of 
dioxins  ( e.g.  polychlorinated  dibenzodioxins,  PCDD,  and 
polychlorinated dibenzofurans, PCDF). It is, therefore, neces- 
sary to deepen the experimental and modeling effort s aimed 
at assessing the impact of possible existing interactions be- 
tween  PVC  and  other  polymers  in  the  SPW  mixtures  on 
product  distribution,  so  as  to  conceive  appropriate  reactor 
conﬁgurations that allow complete removal of chlorine. The 
ﬁrst stage decomposition of PVC (see Sections 4.2 and 5.1.1) 
allows  in  principle  to  fully  remove  chlorine  prior  to  the 
onset of the decomposition of other vinyl polymers (PE, PP, 
PS).  However,  to  the  authors’  knowledge,  no  studies  have 
been devoted to a systematic fundamental understanding of 
interactions between PVC and vinyl polymers (PE, PP, PS) or 
polymers containing heteroatoms ( e.g. PET, PA, etc. ). Starting 
from  binary  mixtures,  this  analysis  should  be  gradually 
extended to mixtures of increasing complexity to properly 
resemble  real  SPW  mixtures.  Lab-scale  and  industrial- 
scale  two-step  pyrolysis  reactors  and  auger  reactors 
[335–339]  have  been successfully  tested  for  chlorine 
removal  from  SPW  mixtures,  aiming  at  satisfying  the  ex- 

18 

tremely low tolerances to chlorine contents in downstream 
reﬁnery processes ( < 10 ppm). 

The lack of fundamental understanding of the occurring chem- 
istry in combination with the multiphase character of the conver- 
sion are deﬁnitely some of the major limiting factors for the future 
growth of chemical recycling. For example, detailed melt-phase ki- 
netic modeling of the thermal degradation of the most common 
SPW  components  (PE,  PP,  PS,  PET,  PVC,  and  nylons)  should  be 
coupled with gas-phase kinetic models. This will allow us to de- 
scribe secondary reactions and to quantitatively assess the amount 
of unwanted products. These models will aid to optimize process 
operating  conditions,  maximizing  the  market  value  of  the  prod- 
ucts while minimizing the emissions. For example, low molecular 
weight alkanes and alkenes (C 
8 ) are largely 
2 H 
released  by  PE  and  PP.  At  high  process  severity  (high  tempera- 
ture, long residence times), these small hydrocarbons can grow via 
hydrogen abstraction, carbon addition mechanisms to MAHs (ben- 
zene), and PAHs. A careful assessment of residence times can limit 
this growth preserving the value of fuel gasses. PS and PET carry 
aromatic rings in the polymer backbone, leading to a faster release 
of  toxic  but  valuable  aromatic  species  such  as  benzene,  styrene, 
and  toluene  in  the  case  of  PS,  or  harmful  oxygenated  aromatics 
such as benzoic acid, benzaldehyde, phenol in the case of PET.

4. State-of-the-art of chemical recycling via pyrolysis: From 
experiment, over model, to process 

Several review papers have been written over the past 40 years 
discussing the experimental characterization and kinetic modeling 
of  the  pyrolysis  of  plastics.  For  instance,  Dickens  reviewed  early 
TGA  studies  for  the  pyrolysis  of  PE,  which  were  done  prior  to 
1982  [340] .  In  addition,  Paabo  and  Levin  reviewed  research  re- 
sults regarding the decomposition products of PE pyrolysis in stud- 
ies conducted until 1984 [341] . Westerhout et al. provided a de- 
tailed  literature  review  of  the  modeling  efforts  and  kinetic  data 
obtained  for  the  pyrolysis  of  PE,  PP,  and  PS  from  the  1950s  up 
until 1994 [342] . Peterson et al. compiled a comprehensive data 
set for kinetic parameters obtained from TGA experiments for PE, 
PP, and PS degradation reported until 1999 [343] . Ceamanos and 
co-workers provided a more recent compilation of the TGA data 
sets  for  PE  pyrolysis  in  2002  [344] .  Poutsma  carefully  reviewed 
all the available data sets for the pyrolysis of different polymers 
such as polyethylene (PE), polyisobutylene (PIB), polystyrene (PS), 
and poly( α-methylstyrene) in his articles published between 2003 
- 2007 [345–348] . Marongiu et al. provided a literature review in 
2007 for the modeling efforts and kinetic data obtained for the py- 
rolysis of PE, PP, and PS [349] . Importantly, Marongiu et al.’s com- 
prehensive paper incorporates the latest assessments of the litera- 
ture produced by the CRECK Modeling Lab (Politecnico di Milano) 
which also covers their earlier reviews on the topic [349] . Brems 
et al. proposed a comprehensive summary of global kinetic models 
(single-step Arrhenius type models) by comparing 21 single step 
models proposed in the literature [350] . The lack of accurate ex- 
perimental measurements of product compositions and the lack of 
accounting for the role of heat and mass transfer limitations in the 
experiments, which is typically neglected, undermines many of the 
results reported in these papers. As it is evident from the afore- 
mentioned studies, early investigations in the ﬁeld are already re- 
viewed comprehensively by various authors. 

However, to the best of our knowledge, no review paper exists 
which summarizes the detailed mechanistic approaches for the ki- 
netic modeling of thermochemical processing of polymers. There- 
fore, the main focus of this section is the detailed kinetic mod- 
eling and related experimental studies, which involve some kind 
of a detailed mechanistic modeling approach. The overall aim of

these  mechanistic  studies  is  to  create  a  comprehensive  reaction 
mechanism for polymer degradation, i.e. the pyrolysis process of 
several  polymers.  The  end-goal  is  the  construction  of  mechanis- 
tic models applicable for a very wide range of process conditions 
as well as feedstocks with varying properties. These mechanistic 
models  can  be  combined  with  ﬂow  models,  which  are  also  dis- 
cussed in this work. It should be noted that mechanistic models 
are a subset of (semi-)detailed kinetic models. Thus, in the follow- 
ing sections “mechanistic model” is sometimes used interchange- 
ably with “kinetic model”. An overview of experimental and mod- 
eling approaches used in the pyrolysis of polymers is presented in 
Fig.  13 .  Different  techniques  used  in  experimental  and  modeling 
approaches result in varying levels of detail in the produced out- 
put. 

4.1. Experimental data 

4.1.1. Lab-scale experiments for kinetic model validation 

In this section, lab-scale experimental studies of thermal (non- 
catalytic)  pyrolysis  of  plastics,  which  have  already  been  used  or 
can be potentially used for validation purposes of the kinetic mod- 
els,  will  be  presented  in  chronological  order.  A  comparison  be- 
tween modeling and experimental results will be provided in Sec- 
tion 5.1.1. Besides model validation, the data can give certain in- 
sights about the progression of the pyrolysis mechanism of certain 
polymers as well as various effects of distinct reaction conditions. 
The lab-scale experiments selected for this section consists of ei- 
ther data which has already been used in the validation of kinetic 
models or data which is appropriate for this purpose. Since it is not 
practical to describe every single experimental work in the ﬁeld, 
only some of the most “recognized” papers are reported here. To 
begin with, Anderson and Freeman experimentally evaluated the 
rate parameters for the thermal decomposition of polyethylene and 
polystyrene with 100 mg samples under a vacuum of P = 1 mmHg 
[351] . The TGA and DTG curves for the degradation of PS under 
vacuum can be seen in Fig. 14 . 

In another early work from 1976, Mucha carried out thermo- 
gravimetric studies of PEs  with different initial viscosity average 
molecular weights (different number of branches of -CH 
3  groups 
per 10 0 0 carbon atoms) in a nitrogen atmosphere [352] . The TGA 
curves of PE degradation can be seen in Fig. 15 , with molar mass 
decreasing  from  sample  A  ( M v = 53.5  · 10 3 g / mol )  to  sample  E 
( M v = 28 · 10 3 g / mol ). 

Thermal degradation of different PS samples (0.5 mg) was car- 
ried  out  under  a  helium  atmosphere  in  a  Py-GC–MS  setup  con- 
sisting  of  a  micro-pyrolyzer  connected  to  a  GC–MS  by  Audisio 
and Bertini [353] . The pyrolysis temperatures were set at 600 and

absolute temperature for the degradation of PS in vacuum ( P = 1 mmHg) (adopted

750 °C  and  the  pyrolysis  time  was  10 s,  which  was  reported  to 
be suﬃcient for complete volatilization of the sample. The pyrol- 
ysis product yields (wt%) of eight different PS samples at 600 °C 
can be seen in Table 7 . Inspection of the product yields of 8 dif- 
ferent PS standards hints that the amount of styrene formed in- 
creases with the molar mass of the sample pyrolyzed. This leads 
to  the  conclusion  that  PS  with  longer  average  chain  lengths  re-

sults in the lower total production of the side-products of benzene, 
toluene, α-methylstyrene, and ethylbenzene. It should be stressed 
that the yield of styrene seems to reach the same asymptotic limit 
and using these experimental conditions it is not possible to ob- 
tain complete depolymerization towards styrene monomer. The au- 
thors also note that the yield of styrene increases by decreasing the 
degradation temperature from 750 to 600 °C, especially for poly- 
mers having a molar mass lower than 90 0,0 0 0 g/mol. The effects 
of the properties of the starting polymer once more underline that 
the experimental data used for validation purposes of detailed ki- 
netic models should correspond to the average MM and dispersity 
deﬁned in these models. 

The  use  of  micro-pyrolyzers  has  certain  inherent  advantages 
such as small sample size (in the order of micrograms), fast heat- 
ing rates (up to 20 0 0 0 °C s -1 ), and low residence times (in the 
order of seconds). As a result of these built-in properties, micro- 
pyrolyzers are known to minimize heat and mass transfer limita- 
tions, promote the primary decomposition of reactants, and min- 
imize  secondary  reactions  [354–360] .  Thus,  they  are  considered 
more  appropriate  for  measuring  intrinsic  kinetic  data  and  per- 
forming mechanistic investigations [ 354 , 355 , 361 ]. It should also be 
stressed  that  the  introduction  of  chromatographic  analysis  tech- 
niques in polymer pyrolysis studies is an important advancement 
in the ﬁeld. Gas chromatography (GC) is an indispensable tool for 
obtaining detailed pyrolysis product distributions, which then can 
be used in the validation of kinetic models. Although obtaining the 
product distribution is absolutely vital, many researchers still con- 
duct TGA studies because of its simplicity in operation and data 
analysis. 

Experimental work in the ﬁeld starts to accelerate in the 1990s. 
Knumann and Bockhorn experimentally studied the kinetics of py- 
rolysis of PVC and mixtures of PVC with PE, PP, PS, and PA-6 using 
TGA-MS [362] . The authors presented non-isothermal TGA and DTG 
(negative ﬁrst derivative: − ( dW / dt )) curves of 20 mg PVC samples 
using helium as a carrier gas at different heating rates. Further- 
more, in Conesa et al.’s 1994 study, the authors report the pyrolysis 
product distribution of HDPE obtained in a micro-pyrolyzer reac- 
tor (Pyroprobe 10 0 0) at 50 0 °C, 60 0 °C, 70 0 °C, 80 0 °C, and 900 °C, 
with sample masses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg and 20 s of reaction 
time [253] . It was stated that the residence time of the volatiles 
in the hot zone of the probe is very short, and consequently, the 
secondary reactions do not take place. This is crucial for attesting 
to the quality of the experimental data with the speciﬁc purpose 
of kinetic modeling. In an environment where the secondary reac- 
tions can take place, the mechanism becomes even more complex 
and it becomes impossible to unravel the dominant pathways for 
the formation of certain products. The experimental product dis- 
tributions  are  reported  in  Table  8 .  Although  the  introduction  of 
mass spectrometry (MS) in-line with TGA is a valuable advance- 
ment for the identiﬁcation of pyrolysis products, it still cannot pro- 
vide  quantitative  characterization.  Extensive  characterization  and 
quantiﬁcation of pyrolysis products with a perfectly closed mass 
balance (100% of all material is accounted for) is a must for the 
accurate validation of detailed kinetic models of pyrolysis of poly- 
mers.

Additionally, in their 1997 study, Conesa et al. compare pyrol- 
ysis product distributions of two different types of PEs using the 
same  micro-pyrolyzer  mentioned  above  [363] .  The  properties  of 
the  PE  samples  used  in  the  study  are  reported  in  Table  9  and 
the product distributions are presented in Table 10 . It can be ob- 
served  that  the  product  distributions  reported  are  getting  more 
detailed  as  years  progress.  However,  the  level  of  detail  reported 
in Conesa et al.’s experimental study from 1997 is still not ade- 
quate for the validation of detailed kinetic models. Detailed iden- 
tiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of individual products up to at least 
a carbon number of 20 is recommended for the validation of de- 
tailed kinetic modeling efforts. An important challenge in exten- 
sive identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation in chromatographic systems 
is peak broadening. Advancements in chromatographic equipment 
and techniques are helping researchers to produce peaks that are 
similar  to  straight-line  spikes  in  which  no  broadening  occurs.  It 
should be kept in mind that processes and conditions used in the 
polymerization processes have drastic effects on the ﬁnal polymer 
properties and these properties in turn strongly affect the pyroly- 
sis behavior of these polymers. For this reason, the differences in 
starting materials, together with experimental conditions, strongly 
affect the product distribution of pyrolysis of waste plastics. These 
effects of the properties of the starting polymer once more under- 
line that the experimental data used for validation purposes of de- 
tailed kinetic models should be carefully selected to represent the 
properties of polymers deﬁned in these models. 

In  their  study  published  in  1999,  Bockhorn  et  al.  used  a 
gradient-free  reactor  with  online  mass  spectrometry  in  order  to 
examine the thermal degradation of PE and PP under isothermal 
conditions [364] . A representative mass spectrum of the pyrolysis 
products of polyethylene at 480 °C is available in Fig. 16 . 

In 20 0 0, De Witt and Broadbelt conducted low-pressure pyroly- 
sis experiments of HDPE at 420 °C in 3.1 mL Pyrex ampules for 30–
240 min [365] . HDPE samples were obtained from Aldrich Chemi- 
cal (MW = 125,0 0 0) in pellet form and different reactant loadings 
(12.3, 20.0, and 27.8 mg) were used. Pyrolysis product distributions 
for  different  HDPE  loadings  and  pyrolysis  times  can  be  seen  in

in which the molecules are separated based on the boiling point 
in one dimension and the polarity in the other [361] . This allows 
higher resolution and accurate analysis of pyrolysis products. In or- 
der to ﬁne-tune the characterization towards better separating dif- 
ferent compounds present in the product distribution, various col- 
umn combinations can be exploited. 

Woo  and  Broadbelt  carried  out  isothermal  experiments  with 
low  molecular  weight  PS  and  PAMS  in  a  ﬂuidized  sand-bath  at 
350 °C  for  residence  times  between  1  and  300  min  [366] .  They 
showed  that  a  higher  selectivity  to  monomer  was  obtained  for 
poly( α-methylstyrene) than for polystyrene. Additionally, in their 
work  published  in  20 0 0,  Woo  et  al.  experimentally  investigated 
the batch pyrolysis of PS in the presence of PAMS [367] . To study 
the effect of PAMS on the decomposition process of PS, different 
molecular weights and initial concentrations were tested for both 
polymers. 

Three  years  later,  Broadbelt  and  coworkers  started  to  study 
mixtures of polymers in addition to neat samples. In Wong and 
Broadbelt’s work from 2001, batch pyrolysis of PP, PS, and PP + PS 
samples  was  carried  out  at  temperatures  of  350 °C  and  420 °C 
[368] . In order to evaluate the impact of total pressure, which was 
also  a  function  of  reaction  time  and  temperature,  two  different 
loadings (20 and 10 mg) were studied for neat samples and 10 mg 
of  each  polymer  was  used  for  binary  reactions.  The  PS  samples 
( M w = 111, 800 g / mol ,  M n = 98, 100 g / mol ) were prepared in their 
laboratory by anionic polymerization [366] . The PP samples were 
obtained from Aldrich (syndiotactic; M w = 98, 100 g / mol ,  M n = 54, 
0 0 0 g / mol )  in  powder  form.  Representative  normalized  yields  of 
alkanes and alkenes from PP pyrolysis at 420 °C for a 20 mg load- 
ing are reported in Fig. 17 . These data are very detailed and are 
very useful for mechanistic modeling. They will be discussed again 
in the kinetic modeling section. 

In their work from 2002, Ceamanos et al. performed isothermal 
and dynamic HDPE thermal decomposition experiments at differ- 
ent heating rates in an inert atmosphere using a thermobalance

Table 11 . De Witt and Broadbelt’s work from 20 0 0 presents an ex- 
tensive characterization of pyrolysis products of PE with the excep- 
tion of products for carbon numbers C 
7 . Additionally, prod- 
24  were  lumped  with  respect  to  their  carbon  num- 
ucts  above  C 
bers, and information above C 
34  does not exist. This type of ex- 
perimental data is extremely valuable for the validation of detailed 
kinetic models of PE pyrolysis since the distribution of the prod- 
ucts is quite broad and employs products in every carbon num- 
ber in varying quantities. Another important challenge in exten- 
sive identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation in chromatographic systems 
is  the  overlapping  of  peaks  of  several  compounds  with  a  differ- 
ent structure, which prevents the individual quantiﬁcation of these 
compounds. This challenge can be partly overcome by making use 
of two-dimensional chromatographic techniques such as GC x GC,

isothermal) experiments can be seen in Fig. 18 . 

In Mehl et al.’s study, the thermal degradation of halogenated 
polymers  (PVC,  PCP,  and  PVBr)  was  studied  using  TGA  [369] .  It 
was  noted  that  these  polymers  show  a  complex  TGA  behavior 
characterized by a wider range of temperatures and double-step 
weight loss with a ﬁnal residue. The TGA results of PVC, PCP, and 
PVBr  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  19 ,  which  evidences  the  analogies  and 
important  differences  in  their  degradation  behavior.  Polychloro- 
prene (PCP) shows greater thermal stability and only starts to de- 
grade at about 300 °C with the formation of HCl and chloroprene 
monomer. The reason for the higher degradation temperature of 
PCP  compared  to  PVC  is  the  different  chemical  structures  sur- 
rounding the chlorine atoms, which are located on sp 2 hybridized 

carbons in the PCP structure (as opposed to sp 3 hybridized carbons 
in PVC). 

Popov and Knyazev presented an experimental study of the ki- 
netics of the initial stages of the pyrolysis of high-density polyethy- 
lene  (HDPE)  [370] .  They  performed  time-resolved  experiments 
(0 − 20 min)  at  ﬁve  different  tem peratures  in  the  400 −440 °C 
range.  They  have  recorded  the  quantitative  yields  of  gas-phase 
products ( C 
8 alkanes and alkenes) and functional groups within 
the  remaining  polyethylene  melt  (methyl,  vinyl,  vinylene,  vinyli- 
dene, and branching sites). The authors used gas chromatography 
in order to record the gas-phase product yields whereas NMR ( 1 H 
and  13 C) was used to detect the condensed-phase products. The 
use of NMR characterization in this work is quite useful for char- 
acterizing and modeling the SPW feedstock. It is important to note

that detailed characterization of the feedstock has not been com- 
mon  in  polymer  degradation  studies  and  this  has  severe  nega- 
tive implications. Additionally, NMR can also be used to identify 
and characterize the ‘defects’ or ‘weak links’ found in the polymer 
backbone. This identiﬁcation is also a big missing point in poly- 
mer degradation research. In this work, proton NMR spectroscopy 

In Miranda et al.’s 2001 study, the thermal decomposition of 
mixed  plastics  comprising  PE,  PS,  PP,  and  PVC  was  investigated 
under  vacuum  conditions  by  dynamic  thermogravimetric  analy- 
sis in the temperature range of 25–600 °C [371] . The results ob- 
tained indicated that some interactions occurred during the pyrol- 
ysis of mixed plastics, especially at higher temperatures ( > 375 °C) 
[ 371 , 372 ]. The authors concluded that PS and PVC appear to be the

polymers responsible for the interactions through their intermedi- 
ate pyrolysis products. It was reported that the chlorine from PVC 
in the mixture is released almost completely before 375 °C. 

In Bhaskar et al.’s study, the pyrolysis of PP/PE/PS/PVC mixtures 
was  performed  by  using  CaCO 
3  sorbent  to  remove  the  chlorine 
content  during  the  process  [373] .  The  pyrolysis  of  PP/PE/PS/PVC

ported that the presence of water in the SPW mixture did not af- 
fect the characteristics of liquid products or the dechlorination ef- 
ﬁciency of the CaCO

3 sorbent. 

In their work from 2002, Czégény et al. investigated the pyrol- 
ysis of different binary mixtures of PVC with other plastics [374] . 
The authors concluded that PVC generally inﬂuences the thermal 
decomposition  of  various  polymer  components  in  a  mixture  to 
some extent. In addition, the dehydrochlorination of PVC may also 
be altered by polymers containing polarized moieties. In PA/PVC 
mixtures,  the  promotion  of  dehydrochlorination  of  PVC  by  the 
amide group was observed. In PAN/PVC mixtures, dehydrochlori- 
nation of PVC with the help of PAN together with the formation of 
PAN ladder sequences promoted by PVC was observed. Lastly, no 
signiﬁcant interactions were reported when PVC was mixed with 
PP, PS, PMMA, and polyisoprene. This study highlights that an anal- 
ysis of interactions among these polymers, that have not been de- 
scribed by models yet, is necessary. 

In Brebu et al.’s 2004 study, thermal degradation of complex 
polymer mixtures containing PE, PP, PS, and ABS-Br was performed 
at 450 °C in the presence of PVC and/or PET [215] . It was found that 
PVC and PET decreased the total amount of liquid products and in- 
creased gas yields. The highest effect was observed for the simulta- 
neous presence of PVC and PET in the pyrolyzed polymer mixture. 
It was reported that more than 50 wt% of the pyrolysis oil consists 
of styrene and benzene derivatives (toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, 
cumene,  and α-methylstyrene)  but  heteroatoms  are  also  present 
as organic compounds. PET and PVC affected the amount and dis- 
tribution of nitrogen-, bromine-, chlorine- and oxygen-containing 
compounds in pyrolysis oils. 

In their work from 2012, Czégény et al. investigated the thermal 
decomposition of various mixtures of ABS, PET, and PVC in order to 
clarify the reactions between the components of mixed polymers 
[375] . More than 40 halogen-containing molecules have been iden- 
tiﬁed among the pyrolysis products of mixed samples. Chlorinated 
aromatic esters were detected from the mixtures containing PET 
and  Cl-containing  polymers.  A  series  of  chlorinated  phenols  and 
bisphenol  have  been  identiﬁed  among  the  pyrolysis  products  of 
polymer mixtures containing ABS and PVC. It was concluded that 
the DTG curves of the mixtures were not simple superpositions of 
the individual component DTG curves, which indicates interactions 
between the decomposition reactions of the polymer components. 
The dehydrochlorination rate of PVC is enhanced in the presence 
of ABS or PET. 

Poutsma at Oak Ridge National Laboratory compiled an exten- 
sive set of experimental results for the pyrolysis of polyethylene 
from the literature [345] highlighting inconsistencies inhibiting the 
mechanistic understanding of polymers pyrolysis. These inconsis- 
tencies and their effects on the validation effort s of modeling will 
be further discussed in Section 5.1.1. 

Finally, it is important to provide a scientiﬁc and technical liter- 
ature review on available reactor technologies aimed at removing 
the chlorine content from the PVC fraction of SPW mixtures. Re- 
actor technologies for pyrolysis of polymers must face heat trans- 
fer as a primary challenge, due to the low thermal conductivity of 
the processed materials. Butler et al. [294] classiﬁed available reac- 
tor technologies for the pyrolysis of plastics. This analysis pointed 
at stirred tank reactors, bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors, circulat- 
ing ﬂuidized bed reactors, and Auger reactors as the most devel-

oped technologies for the pyrolysis of solid materials. Stirred tank 
reactors are widely used for plastic pyrolysis [ 294 , 376 ]. Heat car- 
riers  can  be  used  also  in  this  conﬁguration,  together  with  cata- 
lysts to increase the selectivity to desired products. The mixer fa- 
cilitates heat transfer, allowing a homogeneous temperature inside 
the unit, and scrapes the solid materials that likely deposit on the 
reactor bottom decreasing the eﬃciency of heat transfer. Additional 
drawbacks  of  stirred  tank  reactors  are  related  to  secondary  gas- 
phase reactivity, poor mixing, and consequent temperature gradi- 
ents. Lastly, process operations need to be frequently stopped to 
allow for the cleaning of the unit from the solid deposits. If on 
one side ﬂuidized bed reactors allow high heat transfer rates and 
homogenous temperature yields, Auger reactors are attracting in- 
creasing attention as they prevent issues related to high solid par- 
ticle velocities such as agglomeration, clogging and abrasion typ- 
ically observed in ﬂuidized reactors. Auger reactors are relatively 
simple in design and are constituted by a screw conveying the ma- 
terials, also allowing mixing with inert materials with higher ther- 
mal conductivity, facilitating heat transfer. The main challenge for 
this technology is indeed the heat transfer from the walls to the 
screw axis, in particular in the case of large diameters. Auger reac- 
tors have been often used for the pyrolysis of plastics and biomass. 
Fig. 21 shows an example of the Auger reactor [376] focusing 
on  different  heat  transfer  strategies  such  as  direct  heating  with 
solid  heat  carriers  or  external  heating  through  the  reactor  walls 
by means of hot gasses. It should be noted that the “external heat- 
ing” can be obtained also utilizing electric resistances, in particular 
at the lab-scale, or through the combustion of the gaseous fraction 
released by the pyrolysis process, or through an auxiliary fuel. 

Park et al. [335] recently proposed a two-stage continuous pro- 
cess ( Fig. 22 ) to obtain pyrolysis oil with low chlorine content from 
a PE/PVC mixture. In this case, the Auger reactor is followed by a 
ﬂuidized bed reactor. The ﬁrst section ( i.e. Auger reactor) operated 
at T = 30 0–40 0 °C, removing most of the chlorine content, in the 
form of HCl, prior to the main pyrolysis process in the ﬂuidized 
bed reactor. CaCO 

3 was added to the feed to capture HCl. 

To sum up, the experimental results of polymer pyrolysis stud- 
ies became more accurate and complete over time. The use of ad- 
vanced equipment and techniques, together with the ability to set 
process conditions precisely, helped to collect higher quality exper- 
imental data. Incorporation of new capabilities such as TG-MS and 
TG-FTIR  into  TGA  analyses  expanded  the  capacity  of  these  tech- 
niques to obtain qualitative speciation data. Advancements in sen- 
sor  technologies  have  been  enabling  researchers  to  collect  more 
accurate data and achieve higher repeatability and reproducibility. 
Accurate small-scale experimental setups such as micro-pyrolyzers 
can yield kinetic data that can be almost called intrinsic, i.e. they 
are not affected by heat and mass transfer limitations. Novel chro- 
matographic techniques such as GCxGC enables researchers to re- 
ﬁne the extensive product spectrum. This is crucial for the vali-

dation of detailed kinetic models since they can predict individual 
molecules instead of lumped species. Size exclusion chromatogra- 
phy (SEC) methods such as gel permeation chromatography (GPC) 
grants the researcher the ability to measure the molar mass distri- 
bution as degradation proceeds. Together with the advancements 
in  experimental  and  analysis  techniques,  more  detailed  product 
distributions,  which  are  crucial  for  the  validation  of  detailed  ki- 
netic modeling effort s, st arted to become widespread. This, in turn, 
helped  the  kinetic  modeling  effort s  to  include  more  details  and 
offered more comprehensive validation opportunities. With more 
advanced  and  accurate  detailed  kinetic  models,  researchers  have 
stronger tools to unravel underlying reaction mechanisms in the 
formation of speciﬁc products. Even though there have been sig- 
niﬁcant  advances  in  the  modeling  activities  in  parallel  with  the 
advancements in the experimental ﬁeld, there still exist multiple 
non-idealities present in the experiments that are not accounted 
for in detailed kinetic models. These non-idealities will be further 
discussed  in  detail  in  Sections  4.5  and  5.2.  It  is  crucial  to  note 
that detailed kinetic modeling approaches such as Method of Mo- 
ments (MoM) and kinetic Monte Carlo ( k MC) require accurate Ar- 
rhenius rate parameters. Because of heat and mass transfer limita- 
tions, these parameters cannot be extracted from a pilot-scale or 
industrial-scale setup. Thus, intrinsic kinetic parameters should be 
measured using a lab-scale setup in which the process conditions 
can be set, adjusted, and controlled very accurately. 

Although  there  have  been  important  advancements  in  exper- 
imental  and  characterization  techniques,  there  is  still  room  for 
improvement  for  higher  quality  and  more  complete  experimen- 
tal  datasets.  It  is  crucial  to  note  that  there  is  still  a  need  for 
more extensive product characterization and a 100% (or close to 
100%) mass balance. Ideally, NMR characterization should be per- 
formed for analyzing the defects and initiator fragments present 
in the structure.  For characterizing the branching present in the 
structure, g-factors should be evaluated by measuring the radius 
of gyration. More accurate GPC measurements ( e.g. Triple Detec- 

tion SEC/GPC) are crucial for characterizing the time-evolution of 
the MMD of degrading polymers. Speciﬁcation of important exper- 
imental conditions, such as the MMD or other properties of the 
plastic feedstock, would  ensure  the  repeatability of  experiments. 
Unfortunately, these are not discreetly speciﬁed in many experi- 
mental studies. In addition, more systematic studies that compare 
different polymer feedstocks in a single experimental setup in ad- 
dition to comparing the same polymer feedstocks in different ex- 
perimental setups would be very valuable. 

4.1.2. Large-scale experiments 

In this section, the focus will be shifted to large-scale exper- 
imental studies of thermal (non-catalytic and under an inert at- 
mosphere) pyrolysis of plastics. It is useful to distinguish between 
lab-scale (previous section) and large-scale experiments (this sec- 
tion) because lab-scale experiments are intended for mechanism 
elucidation and measurement of (intrinsic) kinetics, whereas large- 
scale experimental studies are intended for scale-up toward indus- 
trial design. In such large-scale studies, the feedstocks are rarely 
neat polymers and often SPW with relatively unknown composi- 
tion. To begin with, a pilot plant with a capacity of 10–40 kg/h of 
plastic feed was set up and conducted at the Institute of Techni- 
cal and Macromolecular Chemistry at the University of Hamburg 
in the 1970s [53] . The composition of the SPW and the elemental 
analysis of the pyrolyzed samples can be seen in Fig. 7 . The pyrol- 
ysis oil produced was reported by Kaminsky to be comparable to 
that of a mixture of light benzene and bituminous coal tar [53] . 
Additionally, up to 60% of ethene and propene ( i.e. 60% of the gas 
phase which corresponds to 30% of the total products) were pro- 
duced using optimized operating conditions by using mixed poly- 
oleﬁns as feedstock. The composition of the components produced 
by the pyrolysis of mixed plastics in the ﬂuidized bed reactor can 
be read in Table 12 . Later on, Kaminsky et al. reported pyrolysis 
product distributions of neat PE, PP, and PS using the same pilot 
plant mentioned above [377] . The composition of the components 
produced by the pyrolysis of neat plastics can be seen in Table 13 .

In Artetxe et al.’s 2010 study, pyrolysis of poly-(ethylene tereph- 
thalate) (PET) was performed ( T = 50 0–60 0 °C) in a CSBR [379] . The 
authors  justify  their  choice  of  the  reactor  by  referencing  its  ex- 
cellent hydrodynamic behavior (heat-transfer rates and bed turbu- 
lence) and its versatility. In order to avoid the problems of particle 
agglomeration  and  deﬂuidization,  an  optimization  of  the  operat- 
ing conditions was performed. It was reported that PET pyrolysis 
led to a high yield of gas fraction, a low amount of liquids, a sig- 
niﬁcant yield of solid fraction, and a solid residue that remained 
in the reactor coating sand particles. The main products obtained 
were carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, benzoic acid, acetaldehyde, 
and other oxygenated compounds. An increase in reactor temper- 
ature  to  600 °C  resulted  in  the  formation  of  heavier  oxygenated 
compounds. 

For  some  polymer  types,  pyrolysis  offers  great  potential  in 
the direct recovery of monomers with high selectivities [ 212 , 380 ]. 
Olazar  and  co-workers  made  signiﬁcant  contributions  to  the  ex- 
perimental literature in the continuous pyrolysis of different poly- 
mers  with  the  primary  objective  of  the  recovery  of  monomers 
[381–383] . For instance, in Lopez et al.’s 2010 study, the pyroly- 
sis of poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was studied in a pyrol- 
ysis plant equipped with a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) in 
the  400–550 °C  range  [382] .  The  main  products  obtained  at  low 
temperatures are the monomers methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 
ethyl acrylate (EA). When the pyrolysis temperature was increased, 
the  yield  of  monomers  reduced  and  there  was  a  signiﬁcant  in- 
crease in the yield of gasses. The authors attributed these effects to 
the higher severity of secondary reactions at higher temperatures. 
The maximum monomer recovery was obtained at 400 °C, with the 
yields of MMA and EA being 86.5 wt% and 6.2 wt%, respectively. 

Another distinction that can be made for experimental studies 
is the employment of continuous or discontinuous (batch) feeding 
since it directly affects the residence time in the reactor. In gen- 
eral, it can be stated that studies with discontinuous feeding are 
useful for modeling purposes, whereas the results of product dis- 
tribution obtained in continuous studies will be more reliable and 
more interesting for scale-up purposes. The vitality of the differen- 
tiation in feeding mode becomes unmistakable when experimental 
setups with both functionalities are used for comparison. In Elordi 
et al.’s 2011 study, the pyrolysis of HDPE was carried out ( T = 500–
700 °C) in continuous and discontinuous mode in a pilot-plant unit 
equipped  with  a  conical  spouted  bed  reactor  [384] .  The  authors 
concluded that thermal pyrolysis in continuous mode is a suitable 
process for obtaining high yields of waxes in the 500–550 °C range. 
Lower yields of waxes were observed when operating in discontin- 
uous mode, whereas the yield of the diesel fraction was higher. 
The yield of the gasoline fraction was slightly higher in continu- 
ous mode, and that of the gas fraction was similar. The difference 
in the results observed between the two operating modes was at- 
tributed to the different compositions of the reaction media, which 
is constant in the continuous regime. The authors stated that in 
discontinuous mode experiments, the high concentration of waxes

obtained  at  short  reaction  times  enhanced  their  cracking,  which 
is explained by the higher yield of the diesel fraction, consisting 
of  components  with  lower  molecular  weights  than  those  in  the 
waxes. 

In Martinez et al.’s 2011 study, the experimentation was car- 
ried out in a pilot plant which consists of a ﬂuidized bed reac- 
tor,  a  heating  device,  cooling  and  separation  equipment,  reactor 
feeding system, ﬂuidizing gas distributor as well as a control and 
data acquisition system [385] . The feedstock was virgin HDPE (Al- 
cudia 5703-A produced by Repsol S.A.). The more abundant pyroly- 

sis gasses are methane, ethene, and propene, but the propene yield 
decreases when the pyrolysis temperature increases. The scheme 
and picture of the pyrolysis plant are reported in Fig. 24 . The yields 
of main pyrolysis gasses from 5 different experiments using differ- 
ent operating conditions are available in Table 15 . 

In  the  2015  study  of  Artetxe  et  al.,  continuous  pyrolysis  of 
polystyrene was studied ( T = 450–600 °C) in a CSBR with the main 
aim of enhancing styrene monomer recovery [383] . The primary 
products were characterized as styrene monomer, dimers as well 
as trimers, whereas the secondary products were monoaromatics

and PAH, and no solid residue was reported to be formed. It was 
found that the styrene yield is strongly inﬂuenced by both temper- 
ature and gas ﬂow rate, with the maximum yield being 70.6 wt% 
at 500 °C and a gas velocity twice the minimum spouting velocity. 
As a result of the high selectivity towards the styrene monomer in 
optimal conditions, the authors concluded that this technology is 
especially suitable for monomer recovery from PS pyrolysis. 

In  Miandad  et  al.’s  2016  study,  a  small  pilot-scale  batch  py- 
R = 20 L)  was  used  for  the  conversion  of  plastic 
rolysis  reactor  (V 
waste into liquid oil and char [386] . In all the experiments, 10 0 0 gs 
of feedstock was converted into organic vapors, which were con- 
densed into liquid oil after passing through the condenser and col- 
lected in the collection tank at the bottom. The small pilot-scale 
batch pyrolysis reactor is shown in Fig. 25 . The variation of toluene, 
ethyl-benzene, and styrene compositions in the pyrolysis oil with 
respect to temperature and reaction time is reported in Fig. 26 . In 
addition, in their 2017 study, Miandad et al. used the same small 
pilot-scale batch pyrolysis reactor ( Fig. 25 ) to study neat PS, PP, PE 
as well as different mixtures of these polymers [387] . The main 
components of liquid oils obtained from the pyrolysis of different 
types of plastic waste can be seen in Fig. 27 . The authors state that 
all the plastic waste types used in this study were converted into 
liquid oil at 450 °C and 75 min retention time, except PE which was 
converted into wax due to its long carbon chain structure [387] . 
On the other hand, it is reported that mixing of PS and PP with PE 
(50/25/25 wt%), converted PE plastic into liquid oil due to the pro- 
duction of free radicals from PS. The GC–MS results showed that 
liquid oils from different types of plastic waste consisted of mostly 
aromatic compounds with minor alkanes and alkenes with this re- 
actor type and reaction conditions [387] .

time), and (b) reaction time (at T = 450 °C) on the composition of the main products

pilot-scale batch pyrolysis reactor shown in Fig. 25 . 

There also exist different reactor technologies aimed at remov- 
ing the chlorine content from the PVC fraction of SPW mixtures in 
large-scale applications. Firstly, many examples of Auger reactors 
were tested  both at  the lab-scale and the  industrial-scale ( ∼10–
50  ton/day).  For  example,  the  Haloclean  [388]  process  has  been

conceived to treat high quantities of halogenated plastic materials, 
including PVC. Hot sands or metal spheres are added to heat the 
plastic polymers feed. 

DeWhitt [390] patented the Agilyx generation process for SPW 
mixtures pyrolysis and demonstrated the capabilities of Auger re- 
actors to process up to 10 tons/day of raw materials. 

Strode et al. [389] demonstrated the capability of an Auger re- 
actor  positioned  in  a  furnace  to  process  relatively  high  quanti- 
ties ( i.e. 1 ton/day) of various polymers and SPW mixtures. Liquid 
yields as high as 70 wt% were obtained and the presence of PVC 
resulted in a 50 0 0–10,0 0 0 ppm of chlorine content in the pyrolysis 
oil. The addition of Ca(OH) 
2  allowed to decrease such content to 
< 10 ppm when a good mixing between the feed and the additive 
was achieved. 

Concluding, it can be stated that many effort s have been done 
on pyrolyzing SPW with relatively unknown composition in large- 
scale  experiments.  However,  these  experiments  mostly  serve  as 
proof of concepts rather than acquiring quantitative data toward 
characterizing  the  physicochemical  phenomena  at  play  at  scales 
larger than the lab scale. The effort s on underst anding and mod- 
eling such physicochemical phenomena are discussed in the next 
section. In order to implement and optimize industrial-scale py-

rolysis operations, issues like the thermal eﬃciency of the system, 
operational problems and the control of pollutant emissions need 
to be further researched [206] . Obtaining extensive characteriza- 
tion and quantiﬁcation of the product distributions in large-scale 
experiments is also imperative. This kind of data can aid in the 
validation of detailed kinetic models coupled with reactor models 
and serve as a basis for advancing the scale-up effort s of pyrolysis 
processes. 

4.2. Modeling the chemical recycling of plastics 

A chemical reaction mechanism comprises all the reactant and 
product  molecules  and  intermediates  involved  in  a  process,  to- 
gether with the reactions among these species. In order to create 
a detailed kinetic model, the reaction mechanism should be com- 
bined with thermodynamic and transport properties as well as the 
reaction rate coeﬃcients and its reliability demonstrated by bench- 
marking against experiments. The equations in the kinetic model 
should describe the changes in concentrations of species, tempera- 
ture, and pressure using the laws of conservation. Plastic pyrolysis 
processes regularly consist of up to hundred-thousands of species 
and reactions occurring in large and complex free-radical reaction 
networks  [ 345 , 391–393 ].  The  complexity  of  the  schemes  mainly 
stems from the high molecular weight and polydispersity of most 
polymers [391] . In conjunction with this complexity of large reac- 
tion networks, a broad product spectrum is observed in the py- 
rolysis of plastics [388] . As evidenced in Section 4.1, the effects of 
process conditions, impurities, and mixing on the relevant reaction 
pathways in plastic waste pyrolysis are poorly understood. In order 
to increase the total amount of SPW chemically recycled, it is nec- 
essary to further develop pyrolysis techniques for resource recov- 
ery. Levine and Broadbelt underline that one crucial aspect in the 
development of this important technology is a greater understand- 
ing of the kinetics and mechanism of polymer pyrolysis [391] . Ob- 
taining detailed kinetic models is crucial to design a suitable reac- 
tor for the production of building blocks for the chemical industry 
and to increase production eﬃciency. Particularly, unraveling how 
speciﬁc  products  are  being  formed  within  the  complex  reaction 
mechanism is imperative in enhancing polymer pyrolysis technolo- 
gies [391] . On the other hand, the kinetics of the decomposition of 
plastics are of interest from different points of view. Some of which 
are (i) the production of harmful substances during ﬁres or waste 
incineration, (ii) recovering of chemical raw materials from plas- 
tic waste, and (iii) designing state-of-the-art recycling procedures 
[207] . Zhou et al. [6] state that a better understanding of the kinet- 
ics is vital for improving the yields and selectivities of the desired 
products from pyrolysis either by modifying the operating condi- 
tions or by using better catalysts. In addition, a suﬃcient under- 
standing of the underlying reaction pathways of the pyrolysis pro- 

cess will aid in the quantitative prediction of the complete prod- 
uct distribution [175] . As a further step forward, the coupling of 
kinetic models for the thermal degradation of SPW with gas-phase 
kinetic models allows further insights into the secondary homoge- 
neous chemistry, shedding light on the evolution of incondensable 
and condensable gasses (tars) and of unwanted pollutants. A simi- 
lar approach has been successfully applied to biomass gasiﬁcation 
and pyrolysis [394] . 

Different  kinetic  modeling  approaches  employed  to  simulate 
the degradation process of polymers is presented in Fig. 28 . The 
output generated by the different approaches vary in level of de- 
tail and it increases from left to right for the approaches presented 
in Fig. 28 . The vast majority of the kinetic models for the degra- 
dation of polymers presented in the literature rely on global reac- 
tions together with lumped parameters [ 206 , 345 , 367 ], as opposed 
to elementary reactions and corresponding (individual) Arrhenius’ 
parameters. On top of that, for the most part, the models in the 
literature only consider a single phase. In these reaction schemes, 
a complex reaction network can be represented by using a num- 
ber  of  individual  reaction  families.  However,  without  employing 
a mechanistic approach to gain insight into the complex mecha- 
nisms, it is only possible to characterize the apparent kinetics of 
degradation  without  being  able  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  heat- 
ing rates, temperatures, and conversion levels [ 206 , 391 ]. As a re- 
sult, it should be emphasized that the overall degradation behav- 
ior of polymers cannot be grasped fundamentally without detailed 
kinetic models. Nevertheless, creating an accurate detailed kinetic 
model is an arduous task comprised of linking a huge amount of 
species and reactions along with the numerous possible reaction 
channels available to free radicals [391] . 

4.2.1. Global kinetic models 

The main focus of chemical reaction kinetics is calculating the 
rate of an overall reaction. This goal can be achieved in a rather 
straightforward manner using global kinetic models, by simply ﬁt- 
ting a global kinetic equation without accounting for the individ- 
ual  elementary  reactions  and  the  various  reaction  intermediates 
which are formed and consumed [395] . The complex network of 
reactions  underlying  polymer  degradation  has  often  been  repre- 
sented  using  these  global  kinetic  models.  Global  kinetic  models 
try  to  describe  the  thermal  degradation  process  of  polymers  by 
means  of  either  global  apparent  kinetic  parameters  or  a  simpli- 
ﬁed reaction pathway comprising of a few steps [396] . This kind of 
models have been mostly used for the characterization of the rate 
of  weight  loss  during  the  primary  thermal  degradation  of  poly- 
mers or for the characterization of the decomposition process by 
overall kinetic parameters determined on the basis of the weight 
loss  curves  [ 207 , 350 , 364 , 397–399 ].  Most  authors  who  construct 
global  kinetic  models  obtain  the  kinetic  parameters  and  the  or-

der  of  the  reactions  from  data  produced  by  conducting  thermo- 
gravimetric  analyses  (TGA).  However,  nowadays,  it  is  widely  ac- 
cepted in the literature that intrinsic chemical reaction rate (un- 
coupled  from  the  effects  of  mass  and  heat  transfer  limitations) 
cannot be measured using TGA equipment. Westerhout et al. re- 
port  that  TGA  actually  measures  the  evaporation  rate  of  prod- 
ucts during degradation rather than the intrinsic rate of reaction 
[342] . It is stated that, since not every broken bond leads to the 
evaporation  of  a  product,  only  product  fragments  that  are  small 
enough to evaporate at the given reaction temperature will actu- 
ally evaporate and thus lead to a decrease of the polymer mass 
[342] . This circumstance reveals that both physical and chemical 
processes inﬂuence the measured rate of change of the polymer 
mass [342] . As a result, kinetics measured using TGA correspond 
to  apparent  (observed)  values  instead  of  intrinsic  ones.  As  a  di- 
rect result of this shortcoming, global kinetic models are only able 
to simulate the polymer degradation process in a narrow range of 
heating rates and operating conditions such as reaction tempera- 
ture and conversion level [396] . The variation of the rate coeﬃ- 
cients derived from these models results in scattered data because 
of possible mass and heat transfer limitations, which are generally 
not taken into account in the identiﬁcation process of the kinetic 
data [396] . Many authors report substantially different kinetic co- 
eﬃcients even for the degradation of simple polymer compounds 
like PE and PS [ 207 , 253 , 345 , 349 , 364 , 366 , 395 , 396 , 400–402 ]. These 
big discrepancies in the kinetic data are principally attributed to 
two major factors [396] . The ﬁrst crucial factor is the differences 
in  the  properties  and  characteristics  of  polymers  like  molecular 
weight, the presence of weak links, additives, which were used as 
feedstock in the experiments. The second factor is the diversity of 
reactors and experimental conditions chosen from which the ex- 
perimental kinetic data are calculated. As stated above, it is crucial 
to note that these models have very limited applicability since the 
physical and chemical background of the underlying chemical re- 
actions is overlooked. The main objective of creating a model for 
the pyrolysis of polymers is to predict the formation of low molec- 
ular weight products which are in the low carbon range [403] . The 
ultimate aim would be to reproduce the complete product spec- 
trum of polymer degradation in a time-resolved (transient) fashion. 
Unfortunately, both of these aims cannot be accomplished using 
global kinetic models and thus a more detailed modeling approach 
is necessary. Detailed intrinsic kinetic models have the possibility 
to account for the differences in the starting material and also to 
describe the phenomenon in a wide range of reaction conditions 
[396] . They also have great potential to predict the detailed prod- 
uct distribution of the polymer degradation process allowing care- 
ful process optimization. 

4.2.2. (Semi)-detailed kinetic models 

Using detailed intrinsic kinetic models, it is possible to com- 
prehensively analyze the possible reaction pathways under a wide 
range of operating conditions. Using a detailed kinetic approach to- 
gether with net rate and sensitivity analyses, it is possible to map 
the major reaction routes for the formation of LMWPs [6] . Mod- 
els created can potentially be used to predict the product yields 
and  selectivities  even  outside  the  experimental  operating  condi- 
tions. These models allow the tailoring of speciﬁc product yields by 
manipulating the operating conditions or selecting the right cata- 
lysts to accelerate the rate of a speciﬁc reaction pathway [6] . 

Intrinsic modeling of complex processes usually involves sev- 
eral hundred components and reaction intermediates, involved in 
thousands of different reactions. The number of species and reac- 
tions increases almost exponentially with increasing carbon num- 
ber, which results in extremely large reaction networks [395] . For 
this reason, the use of a computer is a must for the generation of 

a detailed chemical reaction mechanism for the degradation pro- 
cess of polymers. Even with the help of computers, the number 
of species and reactions considered in an intrinsic model can be 
overwhelming. A lumping strategy can be applied to reduce the 
chemical  complexity  of  the  system.  The  lumping  procedure  can 
be  accomplished  by  grouping  chemical  compounds  with  similar 
reactivity  into  families  or  ‘lumps’  and  grouping  individual  reac- 
tions into lumped reactions between these families [395] . Although 
some  information  on  the  product  spectrum  is  lost  by  lumping, 
the  predicted  kinetics  should  be  accurate  if  the  lumping  is  exe- 
cuted properly. On the other hand, if a detailed intrinsic modeling 
strategy is adopted, the chemical detail is generally retained at a 
deeper molecular level. Novel kinetic models are bound by strin- 
gent expectations for simulated product distributions of individual 
molecules.  These  expectations  force  cutting-edge  kinetic  models 
to predict process behaviors at the molecular level. The molecu- 
lar composition throughout the entire reactor cannot be simulated 
using the aforementioned lumping approaches. As a result, innova- 
tive research activities were attracted to build more fundamental 
and detailed kinetic models for the pyrolysis of polymers since the 
beginning of the 1990s. 

One  type  of  detailed  kinetic  models  is  the  mechanistic  mod- 
els,  which  attempt  to  relate  observed  kinetics  and  product  dis- 
tributions to the elementary rate coeﬃcients. Mechanistic model- 
ing approaches generate feedstock-independent models since they 
retain a molecular description of the reaction system throughout 
the  entire  reactor  simulation  [395] .  Of  course,  this  level  of  de- 
tail  comes  with  the  necessity  of  the  molecular-level  description 
of  the  feedstocks,  the  reaction  pathways,  the  kinetic  rate  equa- 
tions as well as the kinetic rate parameters. Mechanistic models 
are considered to be fundamental in nature since they explicitly 
describe the reaction pathways by including the reactants, the el- 
ementary steps as well as the reaction intermediates. De Oliveira 
et al. state that in this approach, only a limited number of a pri- 
ori assumptions are needed and the rate parameters are more fun- 
damental  in  nature  [395] .  Poutsma  aﬃrms  that  two  approaches 
exist for creating mechanistic kinetic models [345] . The ﬁrst ap- 
proach involves the deconvolution of composite experimental ki- 
netic  and  product  distribution  data  into  elementary  rate  coeﬃ- 
cients [345] . This approach attempts to deconvolute the global ac- 
tivation energy ( E exp ) and pre-exponential factor ( A exp ) values de- 
rived from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data into the contri- 
butions from activation energy ( E ) and pre-exponential factor ( A ) of 
elementary steps. Unfortunately, the E exp and A exp values are them- 
selves method and model dependent [343] . As a result, it is hard 
to obtain intrinsic chemical rate coeﬃcients using this approach as 
mentioned before. The shortcomings of trying to obtain intrinsic 
kinetic data from TGA results were already discussed above in the 
‘Global kinetic models’ section (Section 4.2.1). Inversely, the second 
approach mentioned by Poutsma attempts to predict experimental 
data from elementary rate coeﬃcients estimated from the behavior 
of small-molecule analogs, which is also called the thermochemical 
kinetic approach [404] . 

Detailed degradation (depolymerization) modeling methods can 
be alternatively classiﬁed into two major classes as deterministic 
(or kinetic) and statistical (or stochastic) [405] . Deterministic ap- 
proaches ( e.g. Method of Moments - MoM) are generally based on 
mass balances, whereas statistical approaches ( e.g. Monte Carlo - 
k MC)  are  generally  based  on  probabilistic  theories.  When  these 
two approaches are combined in a proper methodology, even more 
capable modeling methods arise such as kinetic Monte Carlo (Gille- 
spie’s algorithm) [405–407] . Two major methods that have been 
used more frequently for creating detailed mechanistic models for 
the degradation process of polymers are the Method of Moments 
(MoM) and kinetic Monte Carlo ( k MC). Both methods will be dis- 
cussed brieﬂy in the coming sections.

4.2.2.1. Deterministic  modeling  approach.  Three  main  solution 
methods exist to calculate the rate of the overall reaction in the 
rigorous  approach:  the  complete  solution,  the  quasi-steady-state 
approximation,  and  the  rate-determining  step  approximation 
(quasi-equilibrium approximation) [395] . In the complete solution 
case,  the  solution  is  obtained  by  solving  the  kinetics  for  the 
most general case. De Oliveira et al. state that in this approach, 
the  evolution  of  the  N  species  is  obtained  by  solving  the  set 
of  N  species  balance  equations,  without  any  approximations  or 
additional  hypotheses  [395] .  Using  this  approach,  an  analytical 
solution can only be found for extremely simple cases, so it can 
be concluded that the solution has to be obtained numerically for 
nearly all reaction mechanisms. The biggest advantage of obtaining 
a complete solution is that the model can describe the transient 
kinetic  behavior  of  the  system,  including  the  dynamics  of  all 
reaction intermediates [395] . 

The Quasi-Steady State (QSS) approximation can also be used to 
obtain species concentration by assuming that there is no net rate 
of production for the M intermediates in the reaction mechanism. 
The QSS approximation of long-term dynamics relies on time-scale 
decomposition  and  consists  of  replacing  faster  phenomena  with 
their equilibrium conditions, in order to reduce the complexity of 
the whole model and increase the computation eﬃciency of time 
simulations [395] . This assumption of replacing faster phenomena 
with their equilibrium conditions is generally valid, since most of 
the time, highly reactive intermediates will react as soon as they 
are formed. 

Rate-Determining  Step  (RDS)  approximation,  i.e.  the  quasi- 
equilibrium  approximation,  can  also  be  used  to  describe  the 
species evolution. The main assumption, in this case, is that one of 
the elementary steps determines the overall reaction rate, while all 
other elementary steps are suﬃciently fast to be considered as be- 
ing in quasi-equilibrium [395] . An advantage when using the RDS 
approximation is that even fewer kinetic parameters are needed 
to be resolved. However, as the assumptions used are stronger and 
more restrictive in nature, the time-dependent dynamics of the full 
mechanism cannot be described. In addition to that, the rate equa- 
tion from this approach is a more limited description of the reac- 
tion mechanism [395] . 

The  complete  solution  approach  is  computationally  expensive 
since it involves solving large sets of ODEs. In order to obtain the 
solution to this complex high-dimensional problem, the large set of 
differential equations needs to be reduced into a low-order system. 
Historically, it was not possible to attempt the complete solution of 
complex cases, so researchers were forced to use the approxima- 
tion methods like QSS or RDS to integrate the sets of ODEs. This is 
slowly becoming unnecessary with the increase of computational 
power  and  the  popularity  of  robust  stochastic  methods  such  as 
the kinetic Monte Carlo ( k MC) approach. However, making use of 
detailed kinetic modeling approaches also implies that all kinetic 
parameters of all elementary steps need to be known in order to 
be able to calculate the complete solution. In a broader sense, the 
QSS or RDS approximations are used to simplify the kinetic model 
layer before plugging it into a reactor model. Particularly for reac- 
tive CFD studies, making use of certain approximations might still 
be a necessary step, since the kinetic model must be resolved in 
each mesh point of the CFD. However, for more typical reactor en- 
gineering approaches, the use of an ideal reactor model such as a 
plug ﬂow or batch reactor might be deemed suﬃcient. In that case, 
with the help of increasing computational power and novel robust 
solution methodologies, the use of approximations no longer has 
much signiﬁcance. 

4.2.2.2.0. Method of moments (MoM).  As mentioned above, an 
important challenge in developing detailed intrinsic kinetic mod- 
els  is  maintaining  a  manageable  model  size  [408] .  This  effect  is 
highly pronounced when high molecular weight compounds with 

a molar mass distribution, just as in the case of polymers, are used 
as feedstock. The situation becomes even more complicated when 
the number of branches, presence, and position of a radical cen- 
ter, and location of double bonds are considered for all the poly- 
mer chains existing in the reaction system [408] . In order to cre- 
ate a detailed mechanistic model, in theory, each of these distinct 
species should be tracked individually in an ideal scenario; how- 
ever, this is extremely expensive in terms of computational power 
and time. To overcome these diﬃculties, the Method of Moments 
(MoM) approach was introduced in the 1950s and has been used 
ever since [408–418] . The MoM approach was pioneered by Bam- 
ford  and  Tampa  [ 419 , 420 ].  It  was  further  developed  signiﬁcantly 
in the 1990s by Benjamin J. McCoy and coworkers [409–418] . The 
approach uses population balance-based models together with the 
theory of reactions in so-called ”continuous” [416] mixtures in or- 
der to model molecular weight changes and small molecule evo- 
lution  simultaneously  [ 408 , 416 ].  One  of  the  major  advantages  of 
MoM stems from the fact that it simpliﬁes a theoretically inﬁnite 
number  of  the  mass  balance  equations  for  chain  species  into  a 
much smaller and more manageable set of equations [405] . MoM is 
applied to rate equations written explicitly in terms of chain length 
to  yield  differential  equations  for  the  statistical  moments  of  the 
molecular weight distribution [408] . Solving these moment equa- 
tions allows monitoring the average properties of the molar mass 
distribution as a  function of  time  [408] . Besides, if  the distribu- 
tion type is known as a priori information, these average proper- 
ties can be used to reconstruct the complete distribution as a func- 
tion of time [405] . In addition, by predicting the average properties 
of each chain population, a comparison of the properties of live 
and dead species’ chains can be accomplished [405] . A signiﬁcant 
disadvantage of MoM is that it cannot predict the complete molar 
mass distribution and branching density proﬁle but only average 
values of the corresponding distributions [405] . It is also less accu- 
rate with respect to the representation of the monomer sequences 
and structural defects compared to the approach discussed in the 
next paragraph. 

4.2.2.3. Kinetic Monte Carlo modeling approach.  The kinetic Monte 
Carlo ( k MC) algorithm was originally developed by Gillespie in the 
1970s and it utilizes a stochastic approach in contrast with tradi- 
tional  continuum  modeling  [ 406 , 407 , 421 ].  The  k MC  algorithm  is 
a proven solution of the chemical master equation (CME) which 
determines  the  probabilistic  population  of  a  reactive  mixture  of 
molecular species at a given future time [422] . Vinu and Broad- 
belt state that in the k MC approach, a stochastic simulation algo- 
rithm (SSA) is used to determine the time evolution of the species 
population  based  on  the  reaction  executed,  in  exact  accordance 
with the CME and that the SSA formulated by Gillespie is the ba- 
sis of most k MC models [ 406 , 421 , 422 ]. The k MC methodology has 
some inherent advantages. For instance, Van Steenberge et al. af- 
ﬁrm that the k MC method is easy to implement and does not rely 
on assumptions such as the QSSA for reactive species [423] . In ad- 
dition, manual ﬁne-tuning of numerical integration parameters is 
not  necessary  because  of  the  brute-force  nature  of  the  k MC  ap- 
proach [ 20 , 423–425 ]. Another important advantage of the k MC ap- 
proach is that it has the ability to explicitly describe each and ev- 
ery species in the system, so using lumping techniques is not nec- 
essary [ 422 , 425 ]. This is possible because k MC models track dis- 
crete particles in a scaled homogeneous reaction volume (micro- 
scale) instead of overall species concentrations. Unlike the require- 
ment of using numerical solvers to solve sets of differential equa- 
tions in traditional continuum models, the k MC approach utilizes 
an iterative approach [ 423 , 424 ]. Besides, k MC enables one to ex- 
plicitly track monomer sequences and thus also a direct connec- 
tion of the chain by chain deviations upon chemical recycling [20] . 
A  speciﬁc  drawback  of  the  k MC  approach  occurs  when  the  size 

32 

O. Dogu, M. Pelucchi, R. Van de Vijver et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100901 

of the system to be modeled is enormous just as in the case of 
polymers.  This is because traditionally k MC requires that all the 
possible reaction channels speciﬁc to every species in the system 
must be included in the model [422] . In that case, classical k MC 
approaches become much more computationally expensive as the 
number of reactants and reaction channels increase in the system, 
so  novel  solution  methodologies  need  to  be  implemented  [421] . 
Already, several hybrid k MC methodologies exist, typically applied 
in the ﬁeld of polymer synthesis which considerably decrease the 
computation time requirements [ 421 , 423 , 424 , 426–431 ]. 

4.2.2.4. Reaction  families  based  deterministic  models.  As  discussed 
before,  kinetic  modeling  of  the  pyrolysis  process  for  polymers 
has  been  investigated  since  the  1940s  [340] .  Nearly  all  of 
the  earliest  models  developed  are  single  step  Arrhenius  mod- 
els  (global  kinetic  models),  which  were  repeatedly  proven  by 
many  authors  to  be  incapable  of  describing  the  kinetics  of 
the  pyrolysis  systems  in  a  wide  range  of  operating  conditions 
[ 207 , 345 , 349 , 391 , 393 , 395 , 396 , 400 , 402 , 432–435 ]  and  the  product 
yields, of strong interest for chemical recycling applications. The 
lack  of  suﬃcient  computational  power  to  ensure  detailed  mech- 
anistic  approaches  was  the  main  reason  preventing  these  global 
models to be applicable to an extensive set of operating conditions. 
Preliminary modeling studies of the pyrolysis of polymers did not 
involve mechanistic modeling approaches until the 1990s.

are 
in- 
characterized  by  high-temperature 
volving  hundreds  of  species  and  thousands  of  reactions 
[ 207 , 342 , 392 , 393 , 396 , 402 , 422 , 436–438 ].  As  a  result,  As  a  re- 
sult, researchers have concluded over the past decades that only 
mechanistic  radical  kinetic  models  can  provide  reliable  descrip- 
tions  of  the  entire  dynamics  of  such  complex  systems  [392] . 
Mechanistic models explicitly track all reactions from the radical 
chain mechanism, and all this information is thus fully incorpo- 
rated into the model [439] . Using approximations such as RDS or 
QSS in kinetic models leads to some sort of error and these types 
of  models  are  only  usable  within  certain  ranges  of  conditions. 
Although these approximations may provide suﬃciently accurate 
models in certain cases, they are not reliable under all conditions. 
Models making use of approximations are not able to cover a wide 
range of heating rates, temperatures, and conversion levels using 
the  same  set  of  kinetic  parameters.  Mechanistic  models  provide 
more reliable results in a broader set of conditions since they do 
not make use of approximations such as RDS or QSS. One relevant 
aspect  of  the  complex  and  detailed  radical  reaction  schemes  is 
their  modular  and  hierarchical  structure  [ 4 40 , 4 41 ].  This  feature 
implies that pyrolysis, gasiﬁcation, and combustion reactions can 
be studied by starting from the simpler systems ( e.g. syngas and 
natural  gas)  progressively  extending  their  formulation  to  more 
complex molecules [392] . As discussed previously (Sections 4.2.2 
and  4.2.3),  chemical  recycling  of  SPW  occurs  ﬁrstly  via  a  liquid 
phase molecular/chain radical pyrolysis process which is responsi- 
ble for the thermal degradation of the plastic polymers. Successive 
pyrolysis  and/or  gasiﬁcation  reaction  steps  in  a  vast  reaction 
network  occur  also  in  the  gas  phase.  The  selectivity  to  speciﬁc 
pyrolysis products is largely affected by the strength of chemical 
bonds in the polymer backbone, by the presence of weaker bonds 
( e.g.  tertiary  hydrogens  in  PP),  and  by  the  relative  strength  of 
substituent  (side)  groups  ( e.g.  C –Cl  in  PVC,  C –CH 
3  in  PP,  etc. ). 
Taking all of these features into account  requires a fundamental 
and detailed description of the underlying chemistry of pyrolysis 
[366] . Knowledge of the product distribution throughout the entire 
dynamic of the process allows optimizing the process conditions 
to achieve industrial design speciﬁcations. 

In  order  to  form  the  link  between  reaction  families  and  the 
simulation process, modeling effort s make use of different kinds 

33 

of population balance models. The concepts of population balance 
have started to be formulated in the chemical engineering commu- 
nity in the early 1960s [442] . Population balance equations (PBEs) 
describe how the properties of a group of particles change with 
time  and  position  [443] .  The  system  that  the  balance  equations 
are formulated in is generally assumed to be a continuous phase 
[4 4 4] . Outside the ﬁeld of kinetic modeling, PBEs can be posed and 
solved for a variety of engineering problems such as crystalliza- 
tion, precipitation, deposition, granulation, polymerization, and cell 
growth [4 43–4 46] . The solution of the generic PBE usually requires 
computationally expensive and complex numerical solution tech- 
niques [ 4 4 4 , 4 47 ]. For this reason, a variety of solution approaches 
based on stochastic ( e.g. k MC) or deterministic ( e.g. MoM) methods 
has been proposed [ 4 4 4 , 4 47 , 4 48 ]. These methods help to deal with 
the high-dimensionality problem by reducing the inﬁnite system of 
differential equations into a low-order system [449] . In detailed ki- 
netic modeling approaches, the kinetic information present in the 
form of elementary reactions and their corresponding rate param- 
eters are incorporated into the PBEs  and subsequently solved to 
predict the evolution of the products. 

4.2.2.5.0. Depolymerization  mechanism.  Similar  to  other  chain 
radical mechanisms ( e.g. gas-phase pyrolysis), the chemical reac- 
tions can be organized according to three main classes: initiation, 
propagation, and termination reactions. PE, PP, and PS decompose 
according to a depolymerization process summarized in Table 16 . 
Together with representations of the different reaction families for 
a generic plastic polymer, Table 16 also denotes the reaction fam- 
ilies considered in previous studies from different research groups 
[ 349 , 391 , 450 , 451 ] highlighting some discrepancies. 

4.2.2.6.0. Initiation  reactions.  Initiation  reactions  involve  the 
random scission of the polymer backbone (chain ﬁssion). Despite 
the importance of such reaction in creating the ﬁrst radicals, there- 
fore, triggering the chain reaction, the breaking of a C –C bond in 
vinyl polymers requires relatively high activation energies (E a = 63–
90 kcal/mol [ 349 , 391 , 450 ]) thus strongly limiting the contribution 
of  such  reactions  to  the  polymer  degradation.  The  presence  of 
weak links, i.e. bonds that are more readily broken due to the pres- 
ence of catalyst residuals from production processes or due to the 
presence of impurities ( e.g. oxygen in the backbone) facilitate the 
onset of degradation. The presence of double bonds ( e.g. allylic ter- 
minal positions) also enhances the initiation step as it leads to the 
formation of resonance stabilized radicals. 

4.2.2.7.0. Propagation 

reactions.  Propagation 

reactions  are 
lower activation energy pathways dominating the thermal degra- 
dation  of  plastic  polymers  and  the  formation  of  products.  For 
pyrolysis processes, it is well known that while the radical con- 
centration  is  strongly  inﬂuenced  by  the  competition  between 
initiation and termination reactions, successive propagations ( e.g. 
H-abstractions,  β-decomposition,  etc. )  determine  the  breakdown 
of  the  polymer  and  the  selectivity  to  the  different  products.  It 
is  indeed  quite  unlikely  that  high  activation  energy  initiation 
reactions sensibly contribute to the reactive ﬂux toward products 
at temperatures typical of polymers pyrolysis ( T = 250–600 °C). 

Firstly, end-chain radicals ( i.e. primary radicals) and mid-chain 
radicals ( e.g. secondary in PE, tertiary in PP, and benzylic positions 
in  PS)  abstract  an  H-atom  from  the  polymer  molecule,  forming 
another polymer radical (E a = 11–17 kcal/mol [ 349 , 391 , 450 ]). Simi- 
lar to initiation reactions, the presence of weak links and double 
bonds favors speciﬁc sites for H-abstractions ( e.g. allylic positions). 
The  radicals  produced  via  H-abstractions  decompose  through 
β-scission reactions, producing unsaturated molecules and termi- 
nal radicals. Typical activation energies reported in the literature 
for radical decomposition reactions, involving both terminal rad- 
icals  ( i.e.  unzipping)  and  mid-chain  radicals,  are  in  the  range  of 
27–32 kcal/mol  [ 349 , 391 , 450 ].  β-scission  can  also  occur  in  spe- 
ciﬁc positions for example from an end-chain radical producing a

monomer and another terminal radical that can undergo further 
decomposition. This “unzipping” process (or depropagation) is of 
particular importance for PS as it starts from the favored forma- 
tion of a terminal resonance stabilized radical. In support of this 
observation, a mass selectivity of 70–90% towards styrene is ob- 
served from PS in the temperature range 50 0–80 0 °C as discussed 
by Marongiu et al. [349] and reported in Table 7 . In the case of 
PE, for example, the H-abstraction of the primary hydrogen in the 
terminal position is less favored compared to the H-abstraction of 
a secondary hydrogen located in the middle of the molecule. This 
observation is supported experimentally by the higher amount of 
10  volatile  compounds  released  from  PE  pyrolysis  compared 
C 
to the fraction of C 
2 species (ethene) [349] . Moreover, contrary to 
gas-phase radical processes, the higher concentrations of the liquid 
phase system favor bimolecular reactions. In other words, polymer 
radicals are more likely to abstract an H-atom instead of decom- 
posing via β-scissions or isomerizing via backbiting reactions. 

3 –C 

Backbiting corresponds to an intramolecular H-abstraction reac- 
tion, i.e. the polymer radical, through the formation of a 5-, 6- or 
7-membered ring intermediate and H-atom transfer from one car- 
bon to another, with activation energies ranging between 13 and 
21 kcal/mol for different polymers and hydrogen transfers. 

Terminal radicals formed from β-scission reactions can also add 
to unsaturated bonds. Previous studies [ 349 , 450 ] reported activa- 
tion energies for addition reactions in the order of 6–13 kcal/mol. 
According to Levine and Broadbelt [391] , intramolecular addition 
reactions  are  also  likely  to  occur  with  terminal  allylic  radicals. 
These cyclization reactions form a polymer radical carrying a ter- 
minal unsaturated cyclic structure. 

4.2.2.8.0. Termination  reactions.  Termination  of  the  radical 
chain occurs via the recombination or disproportionation of two 
radicals  to  form  one  or  two  stable  molecules.  As  discussed  by 
Marongiu  et  al.  [349] ,  the  actual  rate  of  initiation  and  termina- 
tion reactions compared to the rate of the propagation reactions, 

34 

O. Dogu, M. Pelucchi, R. Van de Vijver et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100901 

and thus the rate of the overall degradation process, is really low. 
However, these reactions families are critical for creating a radi- 
cal pool, so they have a decisive impact in determining radical and 
dead-species concentrations throughout the reaction. Thus, these 
families have great importance and far-reaching consequences in 
the modeling of free-radical processes. 

4.2.2.9.0. Side  group  mechanism.  The  availability  of  weaker 
chemical  bonds  such  as  the  C –Cl  bond  in  PVC  activates  a  “side 
group” mechanism. Initiation reactions mostly occur by C –Cl bond 
cleavage producing Cl radical and a radical on the carbon chain. 
The Cl atom abstracts an H-atom from the polymer backbone prop- 
agating the radical chain and producing HCl in the gas phase. To- 
gether with this radical dehydrochlorination reaction, a four-center 
molecular pathway is also accounted for in the kinetic model by 
Marongiu et al. [349] . Dehydrochlorination reactions are responsi- 
ble for the ﬁrst mass loss in PVC degradation ( ∼250–350 °C). The 
HCl loss leads to the formation of polyene structures that accu- 
mulate  in  the  system.  Polyenes  ultimately  form  aromatic  struc- 
tures (benzene, naphthalene, etc. ) and alkyl-aromatic structures via 
Diels-Alder  reactions  involving  one  single  polymer  molecule  (in- 
tramolecular)  or  more  polymer  molecules  (intermolecular).  Con- 
densation  of  aromatic  structures  form  PAHs  and  ultimately  the 
residual  char,  without  releasing  signiﬁcant  amounts  of  volatiles. 
These  reaction  steps  are  characterized  by  a  strong  decrease  in 
the  decomposition  rate  occurring  in  the  ∼350–450 °C  tempera- 
ture window. Further condensation and dealkylation cause the sec- 
ond mass loss ( T > 450 °C), with the release of volatile species such 
as small hydrocarbons ( e.g. C 
6 ) and aromatic compounds 
4 , C 
which are not anymore linked to the polymer chain. Addition reac- 
tions also play a role due to the availability of many double bonds. 
Such a reaction family further enhances cyclization reactions and 
PAHs growth.

The  additional  “side  group” mechanism  brieﬂy  summarized 
herein  introduces  additional  complexities  in  terms  of  the  num- 
ber  of  reactions  and  species  when  considering  PVC.  Table  17 
shows key reaction families of the “side group” mechanism for a 
generic polymer structure as described in the CRECK kinetic mod- 
els [ 206 , 349 , 369 , 393 , 397 , 432 ]. It should be noted that the deﬁni- 
tion of the side-group mechanism could be also applied to other 
vinyl polymers like, for example, PS. In such a case, the side group 
5 ). Besides the role of the formation of res- 
is the phenyl ring (C 
onance stabilized radicals through H-abstraction reactions from PS, 
detailed  kinetic  models  should  also  account  for  successive  reac- 
tions of the side group C 
5 ( e.g. H-abstractions from the carbon 
backbone, additions, etc. ).

4.2.2.10.0. Molecular  reactions.  The  presence  of  heteroatoms, 
like Cl, N, and O, can trigger four-center molecular decomposition 
reactions producing two stable molecules (last row of Table 17 ). 
The  activation  of  molecular  pathways  is  mostly  related  to  the 
weakening effect of bonds when heteroatoms are included in the 
carbon backbone. Marongiu et al. [397] observed the importance 
of  molecular  dehydrochlorination  reactions  for  low  temperature 
( T < 200 °C) degradation of PVC. Namely, this reaction directly pro- 
duces HCl forming a double bond in the polymer backbone. Addi- 
tional  four-  and  six-center  molecular  reactions  contribute  to  the 
dealkylation  and  cyclization  processes  of  the  polyene  structures 
derived from dehydrochlorination, leading to benzene and tar for- 
mation in PVC. Similar concerted molecular pathways are respon- 
sible  for  the  formation  of  carboxylic  and  vinyl  chain  end  func- 
tions and of cyclic dimers/trimers/tetramers in PET [235] and of 
monomers  and  dimers  in  polyamide  (PA)  degradation  [ 452 , 453 ] 
and should be accounted for in detailed models. 

Similar concerted molecular pathways are responsible for the 
formation of carboxylic and vinyl chain end functions ( Fig. 29 ), and 
of cyclic dimers/trimers/tetramers in PET [454] , and of monomers 
( ε-caprolactam) ( Fig. 30 ) and dimers in polyamide (PA) degrada-

tion  [ 452 , 453 ],  and  should  be  accounted  for  in  detailed  models. 
Additional lab-scale experiments such as TGA tests coupled with 
speciation measurements ( e.g. GC–MS) would be very useful to un- 
ravel the kinetic pathways responsible for the thermal degradation 
of polymers such as PET and PA and to better understand the rela- 
tive importance of radical and molecular decomposition pathways. 

4.2.2.11. Reference  kinetic  parameters.  Stemming  from  a  well- 
consolidated  knowledge  of  gas-phase  pyrolysis  kinetics  [455] , 
Ranzi  et  al.  [393]  presented  the  ﬁrst  detailed  kinetic  model  for 
PE and PP degradation. The similarities between the free radical 
mechanisms allow to directly derive reference kinetic parameters 
for the liquid phase from those established for the gas phase. Once 
a few kinetic parameters are deﬁned, the analogy between reac- 
tions belonging to the same family ( e.g. initiations, H-abstractions, 
backbiting  reactions,  β-scissions,  etc. )  allows  deriving  consistent 
estimates for every elementary reaction step involved in the degra- 
dation. 

The kinetic parameters for the liquid phase reactions can be di- 

rectly derived from the analogues in the gas phase as [404] :

Corrections  are  applied  to  every  reference  kinetic  parameter

The correction of the activation energy for the transposition to 
the  liquid  phase  is  related  to  the  number  of  carbon  atoms  ( n c ) 
characterizing the ﬂow unit for polymer diffusion, as per the free 
volume  theory.  The  polymer  molecules  move  through  the  liquid

only a small segment of the complete chain. This length ( n c ) can

Activation  energies  for  H-abstraction  reactions  are  estimated 
from Blowers–Masel relationships as reported in Levine and Broad- 
belt  [464] .  In  general,  activation  energies  are  simply  computed 
from (i) the enthalpy of reaction estimated using Benson’s group 
additivity, (ii) the intrinsic barrier, and (iii) the transfer coeﬃcient 
[436] . For each reaction belonging to the same family, the same 
frequency factor is assumed [ 366 , 465 ]. 

Table  18  compares  the  Arrhenius  rate  parameters  adopted  in 
the  kinetic  models  by  Broadbelt  and  co-workers  [391]  and  by 
Marongiu et al. [349] for polyethylene pyrolysis. 

The transposition from the gas phase to the liquid phase dis- 
cussed in the works by Ranzi and coworkers [ 349 , 393 ] mainly af- 
fects reactions with high activation energies such as chain initia- 
tion reactions and their reverse recombination steps [392] . As an 
example, compared to a gas phase initiation reaction of a linear 
alkane ( e.g. n-heptane) occurring through the breaking of a sec- 
ondary C –C bond whose activation energy is ∼81 kcal/mol, initi- 
ation  steps  in  the  liquid  phase  for  polyethylene  are  ∼3 kcal/mol 
more favored (E a = 78 kcal/mol). The entropy change is related to 
cage effects hindering translational and external rotational degrees 
of freedom. A signiﬁcant difference ( i.e. nearly two orders of mag- 
nitude) is observed between the rate coeﬃcients by Broadbelt and 
by Marongiu as expected from ∼12 kcal/mol difference in the en- 
ergy barrier and a factor of ∼10 on the frequency factor. Similar 
deviations are observed for the recombination steps. However, as 
mentioned above, contributions from initiation and termination re- 
actions to the polymer consumption are of minor importance com- 
pared  to  propagation  steps.  Much  better  agreement  is  observed 
for propagation steps, where maximum deviations up to a factor 
of ∼10 are reported. As discussed in Dente et al., “caging effects”
are negligible for these lower barrier reactions, thus allowing the 
direct estimation from similar steps in the gas phase. Overall, as 
evident  from  Table  18 ,  it  is  necessary  to  reconcile  experimental 
measurements, semi-empirical and theoretical approaches so as to 
decrease large uncertainties in some of the kinetic parameters. If 
on  one  hand  a  reaction  class-based  approach  with  reference  ki- 
netic  parameters  obtained  by  means  of  corrections  to  analogous 
gas-phase reactions is consistent and robust, additional informa- 
tion  from  fundamental  experiments  ( i.e.  rate  constant  measure- 
ments) and other estimates should be also integrated into the pro- 
cess of estimating rate parameters. This is one of the main open 

challenges in  the  development of  models  for  the  chemical recy- 
cling of SPW. 

Table  19  compares  the  Arrhenius  rate  parameters  adopted  in 
the  kinetic  models  by  Marongiu  et  al.  [349]  for  polystyrene, 
polypropylene,  and  polyethylene  pyrolysis.  Close  inspection  of 
Table 19 reveals that both the Arrhenius rate parameters and the 
rate  coeﬃcient  (k)  values  for  PE  and  PP  are  quite  similar.  This 
is already expected since PE and PP are structurally very similar. 
Compared to PE, the initiation rate coeﬃcient value is larger and 
the termination rate coeﬃcient value is smaller for PP pyrolysis at 
500 °C.  For  all  propagation  reaction  families,  rate  coeﬃcient  val- 
ues are smaller for PP compared to PE, however, the difference is 
not more than one order of magnitude in any reaction family. The 
differences in the rate coeﬃcient values can be attributed to the 
increased amount of branching present in the PP backbone. During 
PP pyrolysis, several different types of secondary radicals are be- 
ing formed, whereas, in the case of pure PE, only primary radicals 
are formed. Primary radicals are less stable compared to secondary 
radicals and this translates as slower initiation together with faster 
propagation and termination reactions. Additionally, the Arrhenius 
rate parameters and the rate coeﬃcient values for PS are signiﬁ- 
cantly different than PE and PP. This difference can be attributed to 
the structural differences between the polymers since PS contains 
numerous phenyl groups attached to its backbone. Compared to PE 
and PP, the initiation rate coeﬃcient value is considerably larger 
and the termination rate coeﬃcient value is substantially smaller 
for PS pyrolysis at 500 °C. For all propagation reaction families, rate 
coeﬃcient values are smaller for PS compared to PE and PP, how- 
ever, the difference is not as signiﬁcant as the difference in the ini- 
tiation and termination reaction families. The drastic difference of 
PS compared to PE and PP can also be attributed to the radical sta- 
bility during the degradation process. The presence of the phenyl 
groups leads to strong resonance stabilization, which means that 
the initial radicals are much more stable than for PE and PP. Initia- 
tion is thus faster and termination is slower. In addition, propaga- 
tion should be slower as well. 

It  is  also  important  to  mention  the  uncertainties  associ- 
ated  with  the  kinetic  rate  parameters  used  in  detailed  ki- 
netic  models.  Most  researchers  calculate  the  rate  coeﬃcients 
using  correlations  ( e.g.  Evans–Polanyi  or  Blowers–Masel  rela- 
tionships),  directly  obtain  the  coeﬃcients  from  existing  litera- 
ture,  or  use  a  combination  of  both  approaches  [ 206 , 252 , 344–
349 , 366 , 369 , 370 , 391 , 393 , 396 , 397 , 399 , 402 , 403 , 408 , 428 , 432 , 450 , 451 , 
464 , 466–470 ].  There  are  several  different  kinds  of  uncertainties 
important  to  rate  coeﬃcient  calculations  [471–475] .  To  begin

with,  in  the  hierarchical  structure  of  the  reaction  families,  it  is 
typical  practice  to  use  the  same  rate  coeﬃcients  for  numerous 
reactions deﬁned in the same reaction family. This is justiﬁed by 
assuming that the difference in the reactions is not in the reactive 
center but further in the molecule. Although this assumption can 
be  rationalized  as  the  distance  between  the  reactive  center  and 
the far end group of the macromolecule gets larger, it can have 
signiﬁcant  effects  especially  for  oligomers  having  a  chain  length 
of 5 or fewer monomer units. Even though assuming chain length 
independent  rate  coeﬃcients  within  reaction  families  introduces 
errors,  having  an  evaluation  of  these  errors  and  uncertainties 
is  a  massive  amount  of  work  for  one  reacting  system.  Even  in 
the  ﬁeld  of  pyrolysis  and  combustion  of  relatively  small-sized 
species,  there  is  still  no  consensus  on  which  rate  coeﬃcients  to 
use  and  how  uncertain  they  are.  Researchers  are  actively  trying 
to  evaluate  and/or  decrease  the  uncertainties  and  errors  in  rate 
coeﬃcients  of  elementary  reactions  [471–475] .  With  the  help  of 
the  advancements  in  quantum  chemical  calculations,  it  might 
be possible to obtain more accurate and chain length-dependent 
kinetic  rate  coeﬃcients  of  different  reaction  families  involved  in 
the pyrolysis of polymers. 

4.2.3. Kinetic modeling activities involving neat polymers and 
polymer mixtures 

In  order  to  initiate  kinetic  modeling  effort s  f or  pyroly- 
sis/gasiﬁcation  processes,  it  is  crucial  to  extensively  characterize 
the SPW feedstock. Without precisely knowing the detailed com- 
position of the starting material, it is an unrealistic expectation to 
be able to predict the ﬁnal product composition of the thermo- 
chemical  recycling  process.  For  that  reason,  commencing  kinetic 
modeling  using  model  compounds  or  neat  polymers  with  well- 
deﬁned compositions is more appropriate compared to using poly- 
mer mixtures or mixed SPW. Thus, this section presents a review 
of research efforts in the development of kinetic models for neat 
polymers and polymer mixtures, aiming to provide an exhaustive 
state of the art of the reported knowledge, to further highlight ex- 
isting inconsistencies and areas requiring further attention to pave 
the way for the application of chemical recycling technologies for 
SPW. An overview of the (semi)-detailed kinetic modeling studies, 
which will be discussed in the following sections, can be found in 
Table 20 . The table is organized according to the polymer feedstock 
as well as chronological order. 

4.2.3.12. Polyethylene  (PE).  Due  to  its  simple  molecular  structure 
compared  to  other  synthetic  commodity  polymers,  polyethylene 
(PE) received the widest attention from the pyrolysis kinetics com- 
munity. It is important to mention that a great majority of mod- 
els  found  in  the  literature  are  constructed  as  homogeneous  and 
isothermal. Both for the temperature and concentrations of species, 
the gradients within the considered single phase is omitted. The 

only exception to this case is the bubble phase heterogeneity in 
the work of Faravelli et al. [432] . 

Pioneering  work  in  the  ﬁeld  of  detailed  kinetic  modeling  of 
plastic pyrolysis has been carried out in the CRECK Modeling Lab 
at Politecnico di Milano since the late 1990s. Ranzi et al. present 
their ﬁrst mechanistic model to describe the radical chain pyroly- 
sis reactions taking place in the liquid phase for polyethylene (and 
polypropylene) [393] . The mechanistic model consists of elemen- 
tary reaction steps in the liquid phase, whose kinetic parameters 
are derived by making use of the analogous reactions in the gas 
phase. The authors described the polymer degradation process by 
making use of a fairly small number of independent kinetic pa- 
rameters. Faravelli et al. extended the previous study focusing on 
gas-phase products distribution from polyethylene pyrolysis [432] . 
Backbiting reactions are introduced into the kinetic scheme to im- 
prove the performances of the previous kinetic model in predicting 
the product distributions. Even though the SPW feedstock is neat 
PE, this does not imply that only bulk liquid and bulk gas phases 
are present, a dispersed gas phase in the form of bubbles and the 
related  mass  transfer  (see  also  Section  4.4)  within  the  polymer 
sample were also considered and found to signiﬁcantly affect the 
production rate and the distribution of volatiles. 

In  Poutsma’s  2003  study,  for  the  ﬁrst  time,  a  kinetic  Monte 
Carlo ( k MC) approach was adopted to generate a model capable of 
accurately reproducing product distributions for PE pyrolysis [345] . 
Poutsma deduced a radical mechanism that consisted of 19 reac- 
tion families. As expected from the energy barriers and operating 
temperatures, unzipping pathways were found to be of lower im- 
portance compared to backbiting and random scission. 

Previous  studies  did  not  describe  the  formation  of  aromatics 
and  polyaromatics.  Hence,  Mastral  et  al.  from  the  University  of 
Zaragoza presented a model for polyethylene pyrolysis in order to 
analyze the inﬂuence of the process operating conditions on the 
product distribution [252] . A mechanistic model based on a radical 
mechanism was developed for polyethylene with a carbon number 
of  10 0 0.  7  different  reaction  families  were  considered,  including 
initiation, β-scission, H-abstraction, aromatization, and radical re- 
combination reactions. Kinetic parameters were determined from 
a thorough literature review, selecting the values that provided the 
highest level of agreement with experimental data. 

A unifying approach of previous models was demonstrated by 
Marongiu et al., based on reaction families and reference kinetic 
parameters, extending previous studies to other polymers of inter- 
est for SPW recycling [349] . The onset of degradation was found to 
be controlled by the competition between initiation and termina- 
tion reactions governing the initial radical pool formation, which 
is in line with the general expectation for a chain reaction such 
as pyrolysis. The degradation of the polymer and the product dis- 
tribution  is  largely  controlled  by  propagation  steps  such  as  H- 
abstractions, β-scissions, and backbiting. 38 species and pseudo-

contane  (C

netic  modeling  of  pyrolysis  processes  with  a  well-deﬁned  feed- 
stock. Using model compounds instead of neat polymers decreases 
the  total  number  of  reactions  and  species  involved  in  the  vast 

reaction  networks.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  tetracontane  is 
the  only  perfectly  deﬁned  model  compound,  which  is  monodis- 
perse by deﬁnition, to be used in (semi-)detailed kinetic model- 
ing studies. Nemeth et al.’s model was developed according to 18 
reaction families and  parameters  adopted  from  the  earlier  study 
by Ranzi et al. [393] for propagation reactions and from Tsuchiya 
and  Sumi  [476]  for  initiation  reactions.  Overall  the  model  con-

Levine and Broadbelt published a detailed mechanistic model 
for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pyrolysis [391] . For the ﬁrst 
time, the constructed model was able to capture the time evolu- 
tion of multiple LMWPs formed in the pyrolysis process. The au- 
thors especially tried to unravel the role which unzipping, backbit- 
ing, and random scission reaction pathways play in the evolution 
of low molecular weight products. The constructed model tracked 
151 species and included over 11,0 0 0 reactions from 15 reaction 
families.  The  reacting  polymer  melt  was  treated  as  a  homoge- 
neous phase without concentration gradients. Species with molec- 
ular weight < 364 amu were assumed to be volatile and immedi- 
ately  leaving  the  reacting  melt.  All  LMW  reactants  ( ca .  C 
26 ) 
were  assumed  to  react  and  form  smaller  products  before  they 
could transport out of the melt based on the analysis of the rel- 
ative time scales for reaction and diffusion.

Gascoin et al. compared six single and multi-step HDPE pyrol- 
ysis mechanisms, as well as experimental results, from the liter- 
ature  [477] .  The  studies  considered  in  that  work  are  those  con- 
ducted  by  Al-Salem  and  Lettieri,  Johannes  et  al.,  Budrugeac,  De 
Witt and Broadbelt, a single step Arrhenius law, and Németh et al. 
[ 365 , 399 , 450 , 478–480 ]. The authors critically note that due to the 
wide diversity of experimental conditions and probably of initial 
HDPE nature, composition, and purity (presence of additives), the 
comparisons of results turned to be highly complicated [477] . This 
is  a  general  issue  for  validation  of  models  in  polymer  pyrolysis 
studies and it can be addressed using well-deﬁned feedstocks such 
as monodisperse model compounds. It is concluded that a strong 
disagreement is generally observed in the comparisons. The small- 
est difference under isothermal conditions was observed with Al- 
Salem and Lettieri [399] data at 773 K. Finally, the authors, aiming 
at applying HDPE for propulsion purposes, highlighted the scarcity 
of data available for the conditions of interest for solid propellants 
( T > 10 0 0 °C)  limiting  their  analysis  to  a  consistency  check  of  ex- 
isting works and to a parametric analysis to assess temperature, 
residence time and pressure dependences. 

Popov  and  Knyazev  proposed  two  different  reaction  mecha- 
nisms  (limited  and  extended  mechanisms)  operative  in  pyrolysis 
of HDPE, by using the steady-state approximation and numerical 
integration of the differential kinetic equations [370] . The limited 
mechanism  consisted  of  a  total  of  19  reaction  families,  whereas 
the extended mechanism consisted of 41 reaction families. Popov 
and Knyazev also optimized the gas phase rate coeﬃcients of crit- 
ical elementary reactions, namely the C − C backbone scission, two 
kinds of H-atom transfer, radical addition to the double bond, and 
β-scission of tertiary alkyl radicals. The adjusted rate coeﬃcient for 
the backbone C − C scission was found to be approximately 1 − 2 
orders of magnitude lower, supporting the assumption that a con- 
gested PE melt molecular environment impedes the tumbling mo- 
tions of separating fragments in C − C bond scission. 

4.2.3.13. Polypropylene  (PP).  Westerhout  et  al.  [342]  and  Ranzi 
et al. [393] presented the earliest detailed kinetic modeling stud- 
ies on polypropylene pyrolysis, developing upon the kinetics deter- 
mined for polyethylene and showing good agreement with exper- 
imental data. Kruse et al. [403] developed a polypropylene model 
to  quantify  the  molecular  weight  distribution  and  the  formation 
of speciﬁc products ranging from carbon numbers C 
15 . The 
model consisted of 213 species and 24,0 0 0 reactions. The method 
of moments was applied and moment equations were deﬁned for 
15 reaction families. The signiﬁcant effect of the inclusion of weak- 
links ( e.g. one peroxide bond per 180 chains) for T < 350 °C was also 
proved.

As  introduced  at  the  beginning  of  Section  4,  Marongiu  et  al. 
underlined the advantages of a systematic and unifying approach 
to the development of kinetic models for vinyl polymers (PE, PP, 
and  PS).  Likewise,  in  the  case  of  PP,  propagation  reactions  were 

found to dominate the thermal degradation also at high tempera- 
tures ( T = 650 °C). Compared to PE, the relevance of backbiting re- 
actions increases in PP, due to the higher stability of tertiary radi- 
cals compared to secondary radicals. 

4.2.3.14. Polystyrene  (PS).  Polystyrene  (PS)  received  the  second 
widest  attention  from  the  pyrolysis  kinetics  community  after 
polyethylene  (PE).  Woo  and  Broadbelt  pioneered  a  mechanistic 
model  for  PS  and  poly( α-methylstyrene)  (PAMS)  to  analyze  the 
behavior  of  styrene-based  neat  polymers  and  their  binary  mix- 
tures in pyrolysis processes [366] . The authors used in-house soft- 
ware for automated model construction and generated the reac- 
tion mechanism for α-methylstyrene and styrene trimers. The free 
radical reaction families considered in the model were bond scis- 
sion, hydrogen abstraction, β-scission, radical addition, and termi- 
nation via radical recombination. The ﬁnal model consisted of 901 
species and over 40 0 0 reactions. In order to decrease the compu- 
tational cost, the authors made use of the trimers of styrene and 
α-methylstyrene, which consisted of 6 carbon atoms in their back- 
bone,  to  mimic  the  behavior  of  PS  and  PAMS.  They  found  that 
the  rate  of  decomposition  of α-methylstyrene  trimer  was  a  fac- 
tor of 5 faster than that of styrene trimer [366] . The authors re- 
ported that the selectivity to α-methylstyrene monomer was ap- 
proximately 1.0, while the selectivity to styrene monomer obtained 
was 0.65. 

Later,  Kruse  et  al.  modeled  the  degradation  of  polystyrene 
mechanistically using population balance equations formulated via 
the  method  of  moments  [402] .  In this  study,  the  authors  devel- 
oped  ﬁve  degradation  models  of  varying  complexity.  Their  free 
radical  mechanism  includes  9  different  reaction  families  includ- 
ing chain ﬁssion, radical recombination, carbon-hydrogen bond ﬁs- 
sion, hydrogen abstraction, mid-chain β-scission, radical addition, 
end-chain  β-scission,  1,5-hydrogen  transfer,  and  disproportiona- 
tion. The most complex model included over 4500 reactions and 
tracked a total of 93 polymeric and low molecular weight species. 
The  authors  used  their  earlier  work  mentioned  above  and  suc- 
ceeded in gathering the frequency factor and activation energy for 
the Arrhenius expressions of each elementary step in their model 
[366] . 

Faravelli  et  al.  characterized  the  thermal  degradation  of 
polystyrene (PS) by creating a detailed kinetic model [396] based 
on their previously developed frameworks for PE and PP [ 393 , 432 ]. 
The  authors  introduced  a  lumping  procedure  that  grouped  the 
large molecular weight isomers into single species. This approach 
allowed  the  authors  to  signiﬁcantly  reduce  the  calculation  time 
without a major effect on model predictions. 

Kruse  et  al.  upgraded  their  previous  modeling  approach  by 
proposing a mechanistic model to describe the degradation pro- 
cess of polystyrene at the mechanistic level using the method of 
moments [408] , by incorporating chain-length-dependent rate pa- 
rameters and tracking branched species more explicitly. Their free 
radical mechanism includes 64 species and 2700 reactions belong- 
ing to 10 different reaction families. Rate parameters were taken 
from data presented in the literature [ 400 , 481 ] and previous mod- 
eling work in Broadbelt’s group [ 366 , 482 ]. 

Poutsma  approached  the  thermal  degradation  of  polystyrene 
using a kinetic Monte Carlo ( k MC) to simulate the initial distribu- 
tion of volatiles from the pyrolysis of polystyrene [347] . Along the 
same lines of his previous work on PE, Poutsma highlighted exist- 
ing discrepancies in the quite large amount of data available in the 
literature with respect to the effects of conversion level, tempera- 
ture, and reactor type on product distributions. A particular focus 
was devoted to characterizing the formation of styrene monomer, 
dimer, trimer, 1,3-diphenylpropane, and toluene. In agreement with 
the  previous  paper  from  Faravelli  et  al.  [396]  the  formation  of 
styrene monomers was found to be largely due to unzipping (de-

propagation) reactions derived from the favored formation of res- 
onance stabilized radicals. The effects of secondary reactions and 
selective evaporation were also investigated. 

Levine  and  Broadbelt  further  improved  their  earlier  detailed 
mechanistic  model  for  polystyrene  pyrolysis  [464]  by  examin- 
ing three new competing pathways for the formation of styrene 
dimers:  benzyl  radical  addition,  1,3-hydrogen  shift,  and  7,3- 
hydrogen shift. Hydrogen shift reactions were also investigated by 
Moscatelli  et  al.  [483]  for  the  high-temperature  polymerization 
of  polystyrene.  The  updated  free  radical  mechanism  adopted  in 
this model comprises 15 different reaction families: chain ﬁssion, 
radical  recombination,  allyl  chain  ﬁssion,  hydrogen  abstraction, 
mid-chain β-scission, end-chain β-scission, β-scission to LMWPs, 
depropagation  (unzipping),  general  radical  addition,  benzyl  radi- 
cal  addition,  1,5-hydrogen  transfer,  1,3-transfer,  1,7-transfer,  7,3- 
transfer,  and  disproportionation.  Overall  the  model  included  75 
species and 3500 reactions. 

An additional study was published by Poutsma aiming to fur- 
ther explain and clarify the sources of the volatile products from 
polystyrene pyrolysis [469] . The author modiﬁed his existing k MC 
degradation  model  to  incorporate  some  new  reaction  families, 
namely the 7,3-hydrogen shift pathway which involves the 1,7- and 
7,3-hydrogen shift reaction families, radical additions, and the 1,5- 
hydrogen shift. In contrast to Levine and Broadbelt [464] , Poutsma 
concluded that the ensemble of 1,5-shifts, hydrogen transfer, and 
additions  allows  to  satisfactorily  predict  monomer,  dimer,  and 
trimer  formation.  Underestimations  of  the  tetramer  were  quite 

satisfactorily  improved  by  including  1,7-shift  reactions  in  the 
model. 

The state of the art Arrhenius parameters for the pyrolysis of 
PE, PP, and PS, which was reviewed in the above sections, has been 
summarized  in  Table  21  and  Table  22  for  the  different  reaction 
families  for  the  different  vinyl  polymers,  according  to  Marongiu 
et al. [349] and Broadbelt [ 366 , 391 , 402 , 403 , 408 , 464 ] respectively. 

4.2.3.15. Detailed kinetic modeling studies involving halogenated poly- 
mers  (polyvinylchloride,  polychloroprene,  polyvinylbromide),  poly- 
isobutylene,  and  poly(styreneperoxide).  Marongiu  et  al.  developed 
the ﬁrst kinetic model for thermal degradation of polyvinylchlo- 
ride (PVC) [397] , beneﬁting from previous effort s at CRECK Mod- 
eling Lab discussed above for PE, PP, and PS. The proposed reac- 
tion  mechanism  consists  of  40  species  and  lumped  components 
interacting in 250 reactions. According to the lumping procedure 
of all species, four classes have been accounted for: real species, 
linear reference pseudo-species, aromatic and char pseudo-species, 
chlorinated aromatic, and char pseudo-species. The model success- 
fully reproduced the typical two-step decomposition mechanism of 
PVC observed experimentally. As discussed in Section 4.2.2.3.5, the 
ﬁrst corresponds to a dehydrochlorination process, while the sec- 
ond step involves the release of tar and residual char formation. 
The  model  by  Marongiu  et  al.  [397]  also  allowed  considerations 
regarding the product distribution, also in relation to the release 
of toxic components such as chlorobenzenes. Char formation is fa- 
vored for increasing temperature and increased reaction times. As 
discussed in Marongiu et al. [397] , in the case of PVC, char resid-

uals  formation  competes  with  TAR  formation  in  the  40 0–50 0 °C 
temperature range. Yields of 15% wt. of char can be obtained from 
PVC depending on the operating conditions. Increasing tempera- 
ture enhances the rate of formation of solid residuals, as well as 
high residence times. From a kinetic perspective, char formation 
is explained by cross-linking reactions between polyene molecules 
derived from successive dehydrochlorination reactions of PVC, or 
from condensation reactions of PAHs. Similar yields of char resid- 
ual have been experimentally observed by Dhahak et al. [484] . No 
detailed kinetic modeling studies have been presented yet for the 
thermal degradation of PET, however, it is expected that the aro- 
matic structures present in the polymer backbone trigger the for- 
mation of aromatic intermediates that can grow by means of addi- 
tion reactions of phenyl-like radicals. 

Based on the work by Marongiu et al. [397] , Mehl et al. pre- 
sented  a  lumped  kinetic  model  for  the  thermal  degradation  of 
polychloroprene (PCP) [369] . The proposed reaction mechanism for 
the pyrolysis of PCP consists of 38 species involved in 190 reac- 
tions. Similar to PVC, PCP shows a two-step decomposition behav- 
ior observed in TGA analysis. The authors extended the same mod- 
eling  approach  to  polyvinylbromide  (PVBr).  Relying  on  the  same 
set of reference kinetic parameters, a few modiﬁcations to the rate 
coeﬃcients adopted in the PVC kinetic model allowed them to cor- 
rectly predict PCP and PVBr decomposition. 

Poutsma compared two different models for the simulation of 
volatiles  formation  from  the  pyrolysis  of  polyisobutylene  under 
mild  conditions  using  a  k MC  approach  [346] .  The  random  scis- 
sion model was developed by Lehrle while the back-biting model 
was presented by Sawaguchi [4 85–4 88] . After careful analysis, the 
model by Sawaguchi was preferred over the Lehrle model. 

Vinu  et  al.  presented  a  detailed  mechanistic  model  for  the 
pyrolysis  of  poly(styrene  peroxide)  (PSP)  using  k MC  simulations 
[428] . The authors tested ﬁrstly the PSP model proposed by Mayo 
and  Miller  in  1956  [489] .  This  mechanism  involved  key  reac- 
tion  steps  such  as  peroxide  bond  ﬁssion,  alkoxy  radical  recom- 
bination/disproportionation, and end-chain β-scissions. Mayo and 
Miller’s  mechanism  was  found  to  be  only  qualitatively  able  to 
predict the major products ( i.e. benzaldehyde and formaldehyde) 
while the formation of minor products like α–hydroxy acetophe- 
none, phenyl glycol, and phenyl glyoxal was unsatisfactory. There- 
fore, Vinu et al. expanded their k MC model incorporating hydro- 
gen  abstraction  and  β-scission  reaction  families.  The  ﬁnal  k MC 
model  tracked  83  species  (46  stable  polymeric  species  and  rad- 
icals,  21  dimeric  species,  and  16  LMWP  species  and  radicals)  in 
949 reactions. A summary of their Arrhenius parameters is given 
in Table 23 . 

4.2.3.16. Inﬂuence of mixing effects on product spectrum.  Aiming at 
understanding  the  pyrolysis  of  SPW  mixtures  for  chemical  recy- 
cling applications, Faravelli et al. investigated the pyrolysis of PE 
and PS mixtures to characterize the distribution of products of in- 
terest for the petrochemical industry [206] . In order to accomplish 
this goal, the authors examined the effect of the extent of mixing 

of the polymers and their interactions in the melt with the sup- 
port  of  the  previously  developed  mechanistic  models.  The  study 
from  Faravelli et  al.  [206]  highlighted  that  if  the  extent  of  mix- 
ing is poor, the decomposition of each polymer behaves indepen- 
dently. On the other hand, in the case of molecular-scale mixing, 
co-pyrolysis takes place with partial interactions. 

In their work published in 2005, Kruse et al. created a mecha- 
nistic model to simulate the binary degradation of polystyrene (PS) 
and polypropylene (PP) by making use of MoM [468] . The authors 
adapted their previous models for PS and PP by implementing in- 
teractions between PS- and PP-derived species [ 403 , 408 ]. The full 
binary model developed for the pyrolysis of PS/PP mixtures con- 
sisted of over 37,0 0 0 reactions, tracking 277 species. The authors 
assumed that the PS and PP phases were immiscible and thus in- 
teractions between polymeric species of different polymers were 
not signiﬁcant. Lower molecular weight radicals, on the contrary, 
can slightly diffuse (0.037 wt%) in the other polymer and abstract 
from its backbone. 

Furthermore, real-life SPW from material recovery facilities is 
clearly more complex than samples that are artiﬁcially constructed 
for fundamental experiments needed for model development. Im- 
portant amounts of inorganics such as paper, glass, ceramics, met- 
als  ( e.g.  aluminum)  are  present  in  real-life  SPW  samples  due  to 
incomplete separation in upstream purifying processes ( e.g. wash- 
ing) [ 11 , 49 ]. Inorganics are also contained in biomass residues typ- 
ically  found  in  signiﬁcant  amounts  in  real-life  SPW  ( e.g.  wood 
residue  ∼3.3  wt%)  [ 34 , 49 ].  Other  inorganics  such  as  CaCO 
3  are 
used as plastic ﬁllers to improve the mechanical strength of poly- 
mers [490] . A very limited number of studies addressed the effect 
of such inorganic fractions on pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation processes. 
Adrados et al. observed how real-life SPW gives rise to higher solid 
yields compared to a representative surrogate mixture composed 
of PE (40 wt.%), PP (35 wt%), PS (18 wt%), PET (4 wt%), PVC (3 wt%) 
[49] . This is due to the presence of inorganics that, in such sam- 
ples, cannot be converted to gasses or liquids ending in the solid 
fraction. An additional analysis reported by Adrados et al. showed 
how pyrolysis could allow to recover and recycle inorganic mate- 
rials such as metals that remain in the solid fraction and are free 
from binding materials [490] . The amount of char produced from 
pyrolysis also increases with increasing amounts of cellulosic com- 
ponents ( i.e. paper). Unfortunately, cellulosic components also pro- 
mote the production of the aqueous phase, increasing separation 
2 in the gas phase, 
costs, as well as an increase in the CO and CO 
thus decreasing its higher heating value. This highlights the need 
for eﬃcient upstream cleaning processes ( e.g. washing) to increase 
the amount of the more valuable liquid fraction from SPW pyrol- 
ysis  [11] .  The  effect  of  ﬁllers  such  as  CaCO 
3  was  also  analyzed. 
While acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and PVC pyrolysis were 
not affected by CaCO 
3 , polyamide-6 (PA-6) and polycarbonate (PC) 
degradation were accelerated by 30–60 °C. As reported by Avella 
et al., the presence of CaCO 
3 could decrease the thermal stability of 
PA-6, due to strong interactions between the amide groups in the 
polymer chain and electron-attracting metal cations such as Ca 2 +

[491] . Bhaskar et al. observed that CaCO 
3 eﬃciently removed the 
chlorine content ( ∼99 wt.%) from a PP/PE/PS/PVC/HIPS-Br sample 
[216] . Lopez et al. also assessed the impact of calcium carbonate on 
the pyrolysis of SPW mixtures containing PVC [214] . It was found 
that  a  larger  amount  of  chlorine  was  retained  in  the  solid  frac- 
tion, and a lower amount of HCl was present in the gasses. How- 
ever, higher levels of chlorine were observed in the liquid fraction.

Higher yields of aromatics and C 
to the presence of CaCO

Compared to catalytic processes for chemical recycling, such as 
ﬂuid catalytic cracking (FCC) or hydrocracking, pyrolysis and gasiﬁ- 
cation are less sensible to the presence of inorganic contaminants, 
thus  allowing  a  feed-ﬂexible  way  to  chemical  recycling  of  SPW 
[11] . However, for an improved understanding of the effects of in- 
organic fractions, dedicated experiments aimed at careful paramet- 
ric analyses should be designed. Mixtures of pure polymers and 
mixtures of increasing complexity should be tested in the presence 
of inorganics of different nature and variable amounts, for a bet- 
ter representation of real-life SPW. Kinetic models for real-life SPW 
should be developed to account for the presence of such contami- 
nants and unravel the theoretical foundations of such interactions. 

4.2.3.17. Inﬂuences of mixing effects on kinetics.  For the case of us- 
ing  polymer  mixtures  as  feedstocks  for  pyrolysis,  it  is  crucial  to 
understand the synergistic effects of different polymers on reac- 
tion  kinetics.  The  focus  should  be  on  understanding  the  differ- 
ences in the product distributions for the individual pyrolysis fol- 
lowed by the mixing of products and the simultaneous pyrolysis of 
polymer mixtures. In the ideal no-mixing (perfect segregation) sce- 
nario, both product distributions should have the same yields for 
every compound. However, in real-life applications, some degree 
of mixing on the molecular scale might exist. This might create a 
synergistic effect to enhance certain product yields. The synergistic 
effects in the micro-scale root from the fact that different polymer 
molecules undergoing similar radical pathways involve some of the 
same LMW radicals as reactants or products. As a result, during 
the degradation process, the time-resolved concentration proﬁles 
of some of the radicals might be different in the case of mixtures 
and neat polymers. It is imperative to understand the inﬂuences of 
mixing effects on kinetics for real-world chemical recycling appli- 
cations of mixed SPW. 

For the case of PE and PS mixtures, as mentioned in Section 
4.2.3.5, Faravelli et al. report nearly no mixing on the macroscale 
and very limited mixing on the microscale [206] . The authors sug- 
gest that the low molecular diffusivities and solubility of the PE 
and PS polymers in the melt prevent the mixing of PE and PS in 
the molecular scale in the liquid melt phase. This assumption sug- 
gests that the radicals generated inside one of the polymer phases 
cannot easily diffuse into the other polymer phase. Only a slight 
enhancement  effect  of  PS  on  PE  degradation  can  be  observed. 
This enhancement is explained as being caused by the presence 
of radicals coming from PS decomposition, which starts at lower 
temperatures.  Thus,  the  rate-determining  step  in  PE  degradation 
changes  from  chain  initiation,  in  the  case  of  pure  PE,  to  propa- 
gation reactions (H-abstractions and β-scissions) [206] . Differently, 
PE does not affect PS decomposition since the reactivity of PE is 
slower compared to PS. Both in the presence and the absence of 
PE,  the  homolytic  chain  scission  of  PS  remains  as  the  dominant 
degradation pathway. The authors conclude that these results are 
fully in line with the observations of Bockhorn et al.’s 1999 study 
[ 206 , 208 ]. 

For the case of PP and PS mixtures, Kruse et al. [468] make sim- 
ilar assumptions as Faravelli et al. [206] in terms of the extent of 
mixing between two polymer phases. Their model results led them 
to conclude that the degradation rate of PS is unaffected by both 
the diffusion of LMW PP radicals into the PS phase and the diffu- 

sion of LMW PS radicals into the PP phase. On the other hand, the 
enhancement in the  PP  degradation rate  due  to  the  presence of 
PS depends upon the amount of PS radicals diffusing into the PP 
phase and this enhancement can be quite signiﬁcant. Using their 
model, Kruse et al. discovered that allowing 0.037% of the LMWR 
of PS to diffuse into the PP phase enabled the model to capture 
the enhancement of nearly a factor of four in the PP degradation 
rate [468] . A similar enhancement is also observed experimentally 
during binary degradation experiments of PP and PS. Additionally, 
Kruse et al. found that above a PS composition of 25 wt%, the en- 
hancement in the PP degradation rate was relatively insensitive to 
the PS wt% [468] . On the other hand, at very low PS compositions, 
the PS wt% had an enormous effect on the amount of enhancement 
in the PP degradation rate. 

4.3. Fluid dynamics and ﬂow studies 

Calculating model outcomes of a detailed kinetic model to ex- 
plain the pyrolysis behavior of polymers is very hard because of 
the complex composition of the feedstock and the complex under- 
lying reaction mechanism. For that reason, incorporating detailed 
kinetic models into ﬂuid dynamics studies is even more burden- 
some, as the kinetics need to be, in principle, resolved in every 
point in physical space represented in a ﬂuid dynamics simulation. 
As a result, the number of ﬂuid dynamics studies related to poly- 
mer pyrolysis is quite limited. Since accurate and detailed models 
have only been reported in recent years, the existing ﬂuid dynam- 
ics and ﬂow studies in the literature are quite recent. 

In  their  pioneering  work  from  2014,  Niksiar  and  Sohrabi  de- 
veloped a mathematical model for the unsteady-state operation of 
plastic waste pyrolysis in spouted bed reactors by considering the 
heat, mass, and momentum transport [492] . The schematic repre- 
sentation of a spouted bed reactor can be seen in Fig. 31 . Their 
model  predicts  radial  distributions  of  solid  conversion,  yields  of 
individual gas products, solid and gas temperatures, and velocity 
proﬁles  inside  the  bed.  As  a  result  of  the  extremely  high  com- 
putational  cost  of  reactive  CFD  studies,  the  authors  preferred  a 
lumped kinetic model in their work [492] . The implemented re-

action scheme involves parallel reactions for the formation of six 
different product lumps (methane, C 
8 , benzene, toluene, 
and  styrene).  Additionally,  in  2015,  Niksiar  et  al.  applied  their 
earlier  model  for  the  pyrolysis  of  PET  in  a  spouted  bed  reactor 
based on the conservation equations for heat, mass, and momen- 
tum  [493] .  In  this  work,  the  authors  implemented an  extremely 
simple  reaction  scheme  that  assumes  the  ﬁrst-order  reaction  of 
two different types of PET reactants (small and larger particle-sized 
PET) producing lumped volatile products. in two different reactions 
[493] . 

Also  in  2014,  Yin  et  al.  proposed  a  reactor  design  attempt- 
ing to exploit the phase-changing behaviors during the pyrolysis 
of plastic waste [494] . The proposed reactor consisted of vertical 
tubes in parallel with molten polymer falling down along the in- 
ner  wall  while  volatilizing.  The  feasibility  of  this  pyrolysis  reac- 
tor was checked by simulating the pyrolysis process of molten PP 
in the reactor with a tube length of 0.5 m, and by reporting the 
temperature distributions and velocity proﬁles. The tubular reactor 
structure  scheme  and  periodic  mesh  input  used  for  CFD  model- 
ing can be seen in Fig. 32 . Yin et al. implemented an extremely 
simple lumped reaction scheme in which PP is directly converted 
to two separate product lumps of coke and volatiles [494] . Addi- 
tionally, in their 2019 study, Yin et al. improved their CFD model 
by considering the interphase drag force, the ﬂow behaviors, and 
heat  transfer  characteristics  of  the  liquid  ﬁlm  during  the  falling 
ﬁlm pyrolysis of molten plastic [495] . The co-current and counter- 
current ﬂow processes of the air-water ﬁlm were simulated in the 
OpenFOAM® environment using a modiﬁed Volume of Fluid (VOF) 
method. In this work, the implemented uncomplicated lumped re- 
action scheme assumes that the molten plastics are converted to 
two separate product lumps of pyrolysis oil and non-condensable 
gas [495] . 

4.4. The role of heat and mass transfer limitations 

In order to have detailed process simulations of the pyrolysis 
and gasiﬁcation processes of plastics, detailed kinetic mechanisms 
should  be  coupled  with  the  description  of  heat,  mass,  and  mo- 
mentum  transfer  [496] .  The  unmistakable  prerequisite  for  these 
types of comprehensive process simulations is to have intrinsic ki- 
netic information. Apparent kinetic data limits the applicability of 
kinetic models in terms of different experimental conditions. For 
every new set of experimental conditions, a new set of apparent 

44 

kinetic data should be collected. The intrinsic kinetic rate is de- 
ﬁned as the reaction rate with no heat and mass transfer limita- 
tions present. Thus, in order to obtain intrinsic kinetic data, ap- 
parent kinetics should be decoupled from the effects of mass and 
heat transfer limitations. It should be stressed that no experimen- 
tal procedure can yield true intrinsic kinetic data. Even in exper- 
imental setups with minimal heat and mass transfer limitations, 
intrinsic  kinetic  data  should  be  extracted  from  experimental  re- 
sults via careful analysis. Additionally, in a big portion of current 
modeling effort s, effect s of heat and mass transfer are either com- 
pletely omitted via assumptions or incorporated using rather un- 
complicated approaches and simpliﬁcations [ 212 , 328 , 380 , 393 , 496 ]. 
Ideally, the effects of heat and mass transfer should be accounted 
for explicitly in contrast to using apparent kinetics. This will pave 
the way for establishing accurate detailed kinetic models that can 
successfully simulate the full product distribution without needing 
experimental data at/around the same operating conditions. This is 
especially valuable for scale-up studies, where some process con- 
ditions cannot be trivially replicated using experiments. Heat and 
mass transfer limitations can be encountered in all length scales 
(micro-,  meso–,  and  macro-scale)  and  the  detailed  analysis  and 
discussion of each length scale will be presented in Section 5.2. 
In this section, we will limit ourselves to a more general and in- 
troductory description of mass and heat transfer limitations. 

To begin with, the competition between degradation and evap- 
oration (vaporization) is a decisive aspect encountered in the py- 
rolysis of polymers and must be analyzed carefully [497–500] . The 
optimal extensive kinetic analysis should account for the simulta- 
neous mechanisms of degradation and evaporation; however, de- 
tailed kinetic studies of polymer degradation mostly do not con- 
sider the volatilization aspect. Polymer molecules are, in general, 
too large to vaporize. Thus, high polymers must ﬁrst degrade to 
relatively low molecular species in order to volatilize. To start the 
degradation mechanism, chemical bonds must break by a variety of 
initiation mechanisms mentioned in Section 4.2.2.3. Different phe- 
nomena taking place in the volatilization process of polymers can 
be seen in Fig. 33 . 

In  order  for  a  large  polymer  molecule  to  vaporize,  it  should 
break  into  smaller  molecules  at  the  very  beginning  via  chain 
ﬁssion  and  then  possibly  a  combination  of  different  depropaga- 
tion  reaction  families  explained  in  Section  4.2.2.3.  Formed  small 
molecules should ﬁrst diffuse through the condensed bulk phase 
in  order  to  form  bubbles  and  then  these  bubbles  can  be  trans-

ferred to the interface of the bulk and vapor phases. Finally, the 
small molecules which are able to move through the interface into 
the vapor phase are considered to have evaporated. Unfortunately, 
none  of  these  complex  intermediate  steps  taking  place  during 
evaporation have been modeled in detail previously. Instead, the 
general theory of evaporation of organic liquids/melts (in the ab- 
sence of chemical reactions) has been studied by Wall and cowork- 
ers, who divide the vaporization phenomena into three categories 
determined by the rate-controlling step of the process [497–502] . 
Volatilization  rate  ([ = ]kg/s)  can  be  classiﬁed  as  (1)  rate  propor- 
tional  to  surface  area,  (2)  rate  proportional  to  surface  area  and 
inversely proportional to thickness of the melt, and (3) rate pro- 
portional to the weight of the sample [497] . The rate-determining 
step in category (1) is the transfer of distinct molecules from their 
liquid  or  solid  phase  into  the  gaseous  phase  and  can  be  coined 
as simple molecular vaporization [497] . The surface area is critical 
since the rate of volatilization, at a given temperature, depends on 
the fraction of molecules in the surface layer that have an energy 
equal to or greater than the minimum kinetic energy needed to 
break away from the surface [497] . The minimum energy needed 
for molecular vaporization must be greater than the energy result- 
ing  from  the  Van  der  Waals  type  of  attractive  forces.  The  rate- 
determining step in category (2) is the diffusion of molecules to 
the  surface  [497] .  In  the  extreme  limit  of  category  (2),  the  va- 
porization  rate  would  be  determined  by  the  rate  at  which  the 
molecules arrive at the surface since every vaporizable molecule 
would leave the exposed surface much faster compared to the dif- 
fusion  rate.  Volatilization  of  organic  liquids  in  plastic  containers 
can be an example of this case. In this example, the rate of va- 
porization  would  be  proportional  to  the  outer  surface  area  and 
inversely  proportional  to  the  wall  thickness  of  the  vessel  [497] . 
In  order  to  eliminate  this  effect,  the  sample  size  and  thickness 
should be kept small to ensure the measurement of intrinsic ki- 
netics. This effect can be in play especially during the onset of py- 
rolytic processes in the form of a time-delay. The rate-determining 
step in category (3) is the rate of bond rupture within the polymer 
molecules [497] . Since the number of bonds is proportional to the 
weight of material, rates of volatilization for this case is propor- 
tional to the weight of polymer, not to the surface area or thick- 
ness  [500] .  Volatilization  of  most  ideal  (without  any  impurities) 
high molar mass polymers falls under this category. Thus, in small- 
scale (lab-scale) setups the rate-determining step in the volatiliza- 
tion process of polymers is the degradation process. However, in 
large-scale reactors, diffusional limitations on both the degradation 
mechanism and the overall volatilization behavior of polymers are 
expected. 

Considering the competition between degradation and evapora- 
tion mechanisms also hints at the multi-phase complexity of plas- 
tic pyrolysis. In real-world applications, it is expected that solid, 
liquid, and gas phases would be present simultaneously at some 
point during the process. Thus, an extensive detailed analysis of 
the complete process should account for the mass and heat trans- 
fer phenomena within and between all three phases. The inherent 
complexity of the problem of polymer pyrolysis such as polydis- 
perse feedstock, an enormous number of species involved, and a 
gigantic number of reaction possibilities make the implementation 
of the multi-phase simulations remarkably challenging. One con- 

tribution  towards  multi-phase  simulations  was  provided  in  1999 
by  Faravelli  et  al.  [432]  featuring  bubble  formation  and  related 
mass  transfer  within  the  polymer  sample  during  pyrolysis.  They 
found  that  these  phenomena  signiﬁcantly  affect  the  production 
rate and the distribution of volatiles. It is also expected that the 
liquid phase reaction, solid-liquid phase reaction, liquid-gas phase 
reaction, and the phase equilibrium could affect the initial degrad- 
ing process of  SPW greatly.  Unfortunately, these issues have not 
been addressed or analyzed yet in the ﬁeld of polymer degrada- 
tion. Thus, there is an important research gap, yet to be ﬁlled, re- 
garding the inﬂuences of these phenomena in the degradation be- 
havior of polymers. 

As mentioned before, in the pyrolysis of solid fuels, heat, mass, 
and transport effects on the micro-, meso–, and macroscale gain 
a  special  importance  [ 328 , 503 ].  Thus,  detailed  consideration  and 
analysis of these effects from the molecular to the reactor scale 
are crucial to ensure that the information gathered from the exper- 
iments is indeed intrinsic kinetic information [ 361 , 496 ]. To min- 
imize  the  intra-  and  interphase  heat  and  mass  transfer  effects 
on the kinetic measurement practices, reaction conditions, reactor 
conﬁgurations, as well as analytical techniques should be selected 
carefully. In terms of heat transfer limitations, it is crucial to un- 
derstand the effect of heating rates, particle size, and shape, etc. On 
the other hand, for mass transfer limitations, effects on secondary 
reaction routes and overall reaction mechanisms need to be inves- 
tigated. Another challenge that can be encountered in large scale 
pyrolysis applications is the agglomeration of particles by the fu- 
sion of melting plastic pieces inside the reactor [ 53 , 504 ]. Agglom- 
eration  can  greatly  contribute  to  heat  and  mass  transfer  limita- 
tions, especially if the formed clusters are signiﬁcant in size. This, 
in turn, will considerably affect the overall kinetics of the process. 
In the case of ﬂuidized bed reactors, agglomeration can even lead 
to the deﬂuidization of the bed [504] . In order to minimize stick- 
iness problems, special care should be given to reactor choice and 
design, together with operating conditions [504] . 

One way to assess the heat, mass, and transport effects is mak- 
ing  use  of  characteristic  times  or  using  dimensionless  numbers 
such  as  pyrolysis  numbers,  Thiele  modulus,  Biot  number,  Péclet 
number, and Lewis number [ 328 , 361 , 496 , 503 , 505–507 ]. The sum- 
mary of the dimensionless numbers which are useful in assessing 
the performance and limitations of reactors can be seen in Table 24 
together with the corresponding mathematical deﬁnitions. The def- 
initions for the symbols together with their units can be found in 
the ‘Nomenclature’ section. Among these dimensionless numbers, 
the comparison of reaction kinetics to heat transfer is covered by 
pyrolysis numbers, Py I and Py II , which are the inverse of Damköh- 
ler numbers III and IV respectively. The Biot number (Bi) describes 
the intra-particle heat transfer via conduction to that of external 
heat  transfer  through  convection.  The  Péclet  number  (Pe)  is  the 
ratio of the convective mass transfer away from a particle to the 
diffusion of gas-phase molecules through the particle. Lastly, the 
Lewis number (Le) compares the intra-particle heat transfer to the 
intra-particle mass transfer. 

The interpretation of the aforementioned dimensionless num- 
bers can promptly help in assessing reactor performance and lim- 
itations [ 328 , 361 , 496 ]. To begin with, the pyrolysis process is gov- 
erned by the reaction kinetics when Py (cid:9) 1, meanwhile Py (cid:10) 1

geneous mixtures of plastics are likely to be immiscible, the mass 
transfer effect related to the mixing of the components could be 
even more critical. Unfortunately, consideration of heat and mass 
transfer limitations during the degradation of neat polymers is not 
widespread in the literature. As detailed above, all current mod- 
els assume isothermal behavior within a single phase, and mass 
transfer within that phase is not accounted for. The only exception 
to the former statement is the model reported in 1999 by Faravelli 
et al. featuring bubble formation [432] . This attempt is somewhat 
preliminary and it needs to be detailed further. The necessity of 
multiscale modeling approaches for the pyrolysis of polymers will 
be further elaborated in Section 5.2. It should also be stressed that 
since the physical and thermochemical properties of various neat 
polymers differ, the heat and mass transfer behavior of different 
polymers  is  also  expected  to  vary.  Although  this  aspect  has  not 
been addressed or analyzed yet in the ﬁeld of polymer degrada- 
tion, further research can yield valuable insights into the distinc- 
tive degradation behavior of different polymers.

suggests that the process is governed by either conductive or con- 
vective heat transfer in the particle. In the case of Bi (cid:9) 1, intra- 
particle conduction is slower than external heat transfer through 
convection. In contrast, when Bi (cid:10) 1, the controlling parameter for 
the pyrolysis process becomes the external heat transfer. If the si- 
multaneous  consequence  of  Py  (cid:10) 1  and  Bi  (cid:9) 1  is  evaluated,  it 
can  be  concluded  that  thermal  gradients  exist  inside  the  parti- 
cles and thus the reaction rate inside the particle is considerably 
lower compared to the surface of the particle. The case of Pe (cid:9)
1  translates  to  convective  mass  transfer  from  the  particle  being 
much  faster  compared  to  the  diffusion  of  volatilizing  molecules 
through the reacting particle. For an analogous comparison in the 
heat  transfer  phenomena,  Le  (cid:9) 1  implies  that  the  intra-particle 
heat transfer occurs much faster than the mass transfer. 

Navarro et al.’s 2018 study presents data for the overall degra- 
dation kinetics of different biomass and plastic types [508] . In this 
work,  pine woodchips  (PINE-15 mm  nominal size)  and  six  waste 
plastics  (waste  tire  (WT),  polylactic  acid  (PLA),  polystyrene  (PS), 
polyethylene  terephthalate  (PET),  polypropylene  (PP),  and  high- 
density polyethylene (HDPE) were used in the experiments. Fig. 34 
presents the rate of mass loss vs . temperature of pure solids gen- 
erated at 10 0 0  °C/min heating rate. Additionally, Table S2 in the 
Supplementary materials was constructed to represent the Arrhe- 
nius rate parameters of these samples. It can be concluded from 
Navarro et al.’s result that the onset temperature for biomass is 
considerably  lower  than  plastics.  Additionally,  as  a  result  of  the 
rate coeﬃcient calculations, it can be concluded that pyrolysis of 
plastics  is  typically  slower  compared  to  that  of  biomass  by  ap- 
proximately 1 or 2 orders of magnitude [508–510] . For this rea- 
son, it might be expected that the heat transfer limitations are not 
as critical. However, the contribution of the challenge of agglom- 
eration of plastic particles in the reactor to mass transfer limita- 
tions should also be carefully assessed. Nonetheless, since hetero- 

4.5. Future trends in kinetics and ﬂuid dynamics 

Deciding on what type of reactor being operated under which 
kind  of  conditions  in  an  industrial  setting  is  the  million-dollar 
question  of  pyrolysis  of  polymers.  It  is  clear  that  creating  a  de- 
tailed kinetic model is a must in order to simulate the pyrolysis 
of polymers for a wide range of process conditions, highly vari- 
able feedstocks, and to predict the production of valuable products. 
Furthermore, creating these models will greatly aid in designing 
the most suitable reactor for the production of building blocks for 
the chemical industry (or fuels) and increase production eﬃciency. 
As mentioned above, detailed kinetic modeling of the pyrolysis of 
polymers is a rigorous task owing to its multicomponent, multi- 
scale, and multiphase nature as a mathematical modeling problem. 
The holy grail of these models should retain the chemical details at 
the molecular level for every component involved. This means that 
the simulated product distributions of a vast number of individ- 
ual molecules with respect to time and space (inside the reactor) 
should be predicted ensuring a certain level of accuracy. As previ- 
ously mentioned, ensuring this level of detail in simulations is only 
possible with the molecular-level description of the feedstocks, the 
reaction pathways, the kinetic rate equations as well as the kinetic 
rate parameters. Since all of these should be precisely deﬁned as 
inputs to the created models, meticulous research should be con- 
ducted to understand the underlying fundamental chemistry and 
gain mechanistic insights. A ﬁrst starting point for this can be the 
critical analysis of the models presented in the literature (see Sec- 
tion 5.1). Additionally, to gain a more fundamental understanding, 
the analysis of micro-, meso–, and macroscale phenomena should 
be conducted carefully and in greater detail (see Section 5.2). In- 
terdisciplinary cooperation between chemical engineering, polymer 
science, and chemistry will offer a more complete picture of these 
analyses.

As mentioned before, the pyrolysis of plastics regularly consists 
of  up  to  hundred-thousands  of  species  and  reactions  employed 
in  large  and  complex  free-radical  reaction  networks  [ 345 , 391–
393 ]. The complexity of the schemes mainly stems from the high 
molecular weight and polydispersity of most polymers [391] . One 
methodological way to overcome the complexity in both aspects is 
to build preliminary models for neat polymers using model com- 
pounds. As mentioned before, it is crucial to attempt detailed ki- 
netic  modeling  of  pyrolysis  processes  with  a  very  well  deﬁned 
feedstock. Using a monodisperse polymer model compound with 
a relatively short chain length (a representative oligomer for the 
target polymer) will aid in decreasing both the number of species 
as well as reactions involved in the kinetic mechanism. The ﬁrst of 
many goals in this procedure should be accomplishing the valida- 
tion of models with experimental results ensuring a certain level 
of accuracy (depending on the end-use application). After this is 
done,  models  can  be  systematically  developed  by  increasing  the 
maximum allowed chain length at ﬁrst and then introducing a mo- 
lar mass distribution (MMD) to the well-deﬁned input with a high 
maximum chain length. The ultimate case, employing an experi- 
mentally characterized MMD, will be able to perfectly represent a 
real-life neat polymer feedstock. 

After meticulously creating the detailed kinetic model for a sin- 
gle  neat  polymer  using  the  above  procedure,  the  same  method- 
ology  can  be  systematically  repeated  for  all  important  polymer 
types  found  in  real-life  SPW  streams  (See  Section  2.2.1).  Subse- 
quently, the synergistic effects of combinations of different poly- 
mers should be carefully analyzed and incorporated into models of 
mixtures of the previously simulated polymers. This will be a sig- 
niﬁcant step to be able to simulate the pyrolysis of real SPW mix- 
tures. Obviously, the ultimate objective for the aforementioned de- 
tailed kinetic models is to be able to be used with real-life SPW as 
feedstock. As mentioned previously, to achieve this ambitious goal, 
the ﬁrst step should be the detailed characterization of the waste 
stream to be used as feedstock. This should be done ﬁrst to under- 
stand how much of each polymer species is present in the mixture. 
Secondly, the MMD of each polymer type should be characterized 
in detail to be used as an input to the model. Because the waste 
stream is a dynamic mixture of several polymers, the above proce- 
dure to fully characterize the SPW feedstock should be frequently 
repeated. One way to circumvent this dependency of the model to 
the feedstock composition is to relate the detailed feedstock char- 
acterization to certain global properties of the mixture (molecu- 
lar reconstruction of feedstock) as is being done in steam crack- 
ing applications [ 511 , 512 ]. In addition to the above observations, 
detailed kinetic models of increasing accuracy offer the possibil- 
ity of designing experiments for further validations, exploring wide 
ranges of process conditions ( e.g. temperature, residence time, etc. ) 
by means of relatively quick parametric analysis. 

Keeping the goal of industrial scale-up in mind, these detailed 
kinetic models should be coupled with reactor and ﬂow models 
to explain the temporal and spatial evolution of the complete pro- 
cess in molecular detail. It should be stated that it is very chal- 
lenging to incorporate a detailed polymer pyrolysis kinetic model 
into a ﬂuid dynamics model [513] . Since the created kinetic models 
tend to grow in terms of the total number of species and reactions 
involved,  their  incorporation  into  complicated  reactor  and  ﬂow 
models is currently problematic in terms of computational power 
[514] . The complexity of the chemical details is generally too com- 
putationally expensive on top of the ﬂuid simulations [513–515] . 
However, knowledge of combustion ﬂow modeling could provide 
a good place to start [ 513 , 516 , 517 ]. Intelligent and effective model 
reduction techniques can be a way to spare some of the required 
computational power [ 514 , 515 ]. Model reduction techniques used 
in the combustion ﬂow modeling community could provide pro- 
ductive insights into the search for different ways to enable this

heating rates of 8 °C/min and 20 °C/min (adopted from [393] ). 

coupling [ 513 , 516 , 517 ]. Numerical optimizations of the solvers used 
in solving the associated differential equations will also help. Ad- 
ditionally, advances in computer hardware will allow meeting the 
desired computational demand, while avoiding excessive model re- 
duction to balance accuracy and computational costs. 

5. Model assessment and validity 

The ﬁrst part of this section (Section 5.1) aims to provide a de- 
scriptive overview and comparison of modeling and experimental 
results without detailed analysis. Whereas, in Section 5.2, a critical 
analysis of the discussed literature is presented focusing on differ- 
ent length scales (micro-, meso–, and macro-scale) both for neat 
and mixed polymer feedstocks. Unless otherwise stated, in the ﬁg- 
ures presented in this section, solid lines (—) represent simulated 
results and symbols ( ◦,- (cid:2)-,- (cid:7)-, etc. ) represent experimental data. 

5.1. Comparisons between model and experiments 

5.1.1. Kinetics 

Ranzi et al. validated the PE and PP kinetic models by compar- 
isons between model predictions and TGA experiments [393] us- 
ing data from Anderson and Freeman [ 351 , 393 ] at T = 30 0–50 0 °C 
and p = 1 mmHg, and newly acquired data at T = 400–520 °C and 
P = 1 atm. The comparison of experimental data and simulation re- 
sults for PE pyrolysis at 8 °C/min and 20 °C/min heating rates are 
reported in Fig. 35 . Also for PP, new experimental data were re- 
ported at T = 360–500 °C and P = 1 atm and successfully compared 
with model predictions. 

Faravelli  et  al.  further  validated  the  previous  PE  model 
[393] with experimental results obtained from a commercial ana- 
lytical pyrolyzer (Pyroprobe 20 0 0 CDS) as well as thermogravimet- 
ric analysis (TGA) [432] . As in Fig. 36 , the model reproduced sat- 
isfactorily measured product distributions highlighting a gradually 
decreasing trend towards the formation of higher carbon products 
due to additional cracking and relatively large amounts of lighter 
products typical of the backbiting reaction steps [432] . Addition- 
ally, by making use of dynamic and isothermal TGA studies from 
the literature, Marongiu et al. extended the validation targets in- 
cluding  product  distribution  measured  by  Michajlov  and  Zugen- 
maier [518] ( Fig. 37 ). 

Mastral et al. carried out experiments in a ﬂuidized bed reactor 
at different temperatures (640–700 °C) and residence times (0.8–
2.6 s)  [252] .  The  proposed  model  was  capable  of  predicting  the 
product distribution quite accurately ( Fig. 38 ). 

The model from Nemeth et al. was capable of qualitatively re- 
producing the gas phase composition with ethene, propene, and 
butene being the most abundant species [253] . The comparison of

mental values obtained from the literature can be seen in Table 25

The  model  from  Levine  and  Broadbelt  was  used  to  success- 
fully predict the product distributions for LMWPs in HDPE pyrol- 
ysis at 420 °C [ 365 , 391 ]. The values of M w (weight-average molec- 
ular weight) and M n (number-average molecular weight) used are 
125,0 0 0 and 62,500 respectively with the assumption of a poly- 
dispersity equal to 2. The authors reported that the model results 
changed  slightly  if  the  initial  polydispersity  was  assumed  to  be 
1.5. Modeling results and experimental values for the time evolu- 

tion of  alkane, alkene, and total LWMPs  are reported in  Fig. 39 . 
Finally, Popov and Knyazev [370] measured the gas-phase compo- 
sition in PE pyrolysis at T = 400–440 °C as reported in Fig. 20 . C 
3 H 
8 
and C 
6 were highlighted as the most abundant pyrolysis prod-

ucts for HDPE. 

When  polystyrene  is  the  polymer  under  consideration,  the 
model  from  Woo  and  Broadbelt  was  able  to  track  the  evolution 
of  the  molar  mass  distribution  with  respect  to  reaction  time  at 
T = 350 °C as reported in Fig. 40 [366] . 

The model results further suggested that the selectivity to α- 
methylstyrene monomer was approximately 1.0, in agreement with 
the  experimental  observations,  while  the  selectivity  to  styrene 
monomer obtained was 0.65 [366] . This is a noteworthy variation 
since the polymers are extremely similar in molecular structure. It 
was also revealed by the mechanistic model results that the rate of

decomposition of α-methylstyrene trimer was 5 times faster than 
that  of  the  styrene  trimer.  In  addition  to  that,  it  was  revealed, 
in the binary mixture experiments, that the reactivity of PS was 
enhanced in the presence of PAMS, and the selectivity to styrene 
monomer was increased [366] . The authors also reported that the 
degradation of PS was dependent on the molecular weight of the 
utilized PAMS [367] . There was only a slight change in the yields 
of PS degradation products when the initial concentrations of reac- 
tants were varied. This enhancement in the molar yields of styrene 
production from PS with the synergistic effect of PAMS can be seen 
in Fig. 41 . The authors concluded that, when the addition of an ap- 
propriate co-reactant is utilized, the co-processing of polymers is 
a viable resource recovery strategy to produce speciﬁc high-value 
chemicals. 

Kruse  et  al.  further  improved  the  predictions  from  their  pre- 
vious model [366] by including branching reactions and branched 
species [402] . The inclusion of branching is an important progress 
for the state-of-the-art in polymer degradation research. The repre- 
sentative comparison of model and experimental results is shown 
in Fig. 42 [402] . The experimentally observed difference between 
M n and M w was successfully reproduced using the model. The au- 
thors  attributed  this  improved  performance  to  the  incorporation 
of the addition by mid-chain radicals to unsaturated chain-ends to 
form large branched species. 

Fig. 42.  Comparison of results of linear decomposition model with experimental 
data for (a) M w and M n and (b) styrene yields (adopted from [402] ). 

Faravelli et al. collected various experimental results from the 
literature covering different pressure and temperature conditions, 
in  order  to  assess  the  predictive  capability  of  the  model  over  a 
wider  range  of  conditions  of  interest  [ 351 , 396 , 400 , 401 ].  Experi- 
mental  pyrolysis  products  observed  included  light  hydrocarbons, 
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene monomer, dimer, trimer, 
α-methyl-styrene, and 1,3 diphenylpropane. The comparison of re- 
sults from model simulations with experimental data from Bock- 
horn et al. [519] and Madorsky [401] are reported in Fig. 43 . De- 
spite the general good agreement, the authors underlined deﬁcien- 
cies in predicting benzene formation. 

Kruse et al. [408] compared the model results to experimen- 
tal data on the degradation of PS of different molecular weights 
( M n = 5160, 42,500, 50,550, and 98,100) and at different temper- 
atures  (310,  350,  380,  and  420 °C).  This  work  extends  the  au- 
thors’  previous  modeling  effort s  [402]  by  incorporating  chain- 
length-dependent rate parameters together with tracking branched 
species more explicitly. The comparison of the simulation outputs

experimental data for the yields of ﬁve major alkenes and ﬁve ma- 
jor alkanes. The comparison of the simulation outputs with exper- 
imental data is reported in Fig. 48 . 

Kruse  et  al.  also  incorporated  weak  backbone  links  (peroxide 
bonds) in their model in order to simulate the effect on the evolu- 
tion of polypropylene molecular weight [403] . Although the identi- 
ﬁcation and characterization of ‘weak-links’ are essential for poly- 
mer degradation research, this has never been done before. Kruse 
et  al.  advanced  the  state-of-the-art  on  PP  pyrolysis  by  consider- 
ing ‘weak-links’ for the ﬁrst time. Kruse et al.’s model was found 
in good agreement with the experimental data of Chan and Balke 
[521] . The comparison is reported in Fig. 49 . 

For the case of PVC, Marongiu et al. analyzed different sets of 
thermogravimetric data from the literature with different heating 
rates  as  well  as  various  isothermal  runs  to  validate  their  model 
[ 207 , 397 , 522–528 ]. The model could describe PVC pyrolysis for a 
wide range of operating conditions, although a need for more ex- 
perimental  and  modeling  work  was  underlined  to  solve  existing 
inconsistencies [397] . Some of these disagreements are the under- 
estimation of HCl wt% in the low-temperature condition (270 °C) 
and model inadequacies for reproducing the experimental data for 
real polymers that contain additives and/or branches. The authors 
note that the PVC pyrolysis mechanism can be considered to be a 
more complex case than PE, PP, or PS since it involves signiﬁcant 
cross-linking reactions with the formation of polyaromatic struc- 
tures (possibly chlorinated) and a carbonaceous residue (char). The 
introduction of chlorine as an additional element to the existing 
carbon and hydrogen in the case of PE, PP, and PS also signiﬁcantly 
contributes to the complexity. Thus, as the authors underline, this 
intricacy of the chemistry of PVC pyrolysis calls for several sim- 
pliﬁcations and lumping procedures to handle the huge amount of 
intermediate and ﬁnal products. The comparison of the simulation 
outputs with experimental data from Bockhorn et al. [207] is re- 
ported in Fig. 50 . 

Mehl  et  al.  further  validated  the  PVC  model  by  comparison 
with  additional  thermogravimetric  analyses  [369] .  The  complete 
model including all the reactions and their corresponding kinetic 
rate parameters can be examined in the ‘Supplementary materi- 
als’. They have progressed the state-of-the-art in PVC degradation 
by expanding and further detailing their reaction mechanism from 
their previous study from 2003 [397] . Additionally, the extension 
of the PVC model to the thermal degradation of PCP and PVBr was 
also successfully accomplished [369] . Experimental data [529] and 
model predictions for HCl release proﬁles from PCP pyrolysis are 
reported in Fig. 51 . 

For  the  case  of  PSP  pyrolysis,  Fig.  52  shows  the  time  evolu- 
tion of remaining peroxide bond concentration for different start- 
ing  numbers  of  chains  in  k MC  as  reported  by  Vinu  et  al.  [428] . 
The results are compared with the experimental data of Mayo and 
Miller  [489] .  The  model  was  found  to  predict  the  formation  of 
all the minor products quantitatively as well as matching the ex- 
perimental data of remaining peroxide bonds as demonstrated in 
Fig. 52 . 

In the case of polymer mixtures, Faravelli et al. compared model 
results for PE/PS mixtures degradation with TGA studies performed 
at different scales of mixing [206] . As can be seen from Fig. 53 , the 
authors proposed a Completely Mixed Model (CMM) and a Com- 
pletely Segregated Model (CSM), with the latter giving a satisfac- 
tory  explanation  of  several  experimental  data  from  the  thermal 
degradation of different PE/PS mixtures. The CMM overestimates 
the mutual inﬂuence of the polymers and it is not suitable for real- 
world applications. This ﬁnding conﬁrms the quite low interactions 
between PS and PE degradation processes. Deeper mixings increase 
the PE volatilization during PS depolymerization because of the at- 
tack of radicals formed during the PS conversion. Furthermore, in 
between these two asymptotic approaches, the two-phase model

[ 401 , 519 ] (adopted from [396] ). 

with experimental data for 5160 molecular weight PS at 350 °C can 
be seen in Fig. 44 . 

For the covered temperature and molecular weight ranges, the 
authors conﬁrmed the validity of the model to accurately predict 
the evolution of M n and M w as well as the yields of styrene, dimer, 
and trimer. The authors attributed the successful representation of 
different  initial  molecular  weights  in  the  model  to  the  incorpo- 
ration of chain-length-dependent rate parameters for termination 
and  chain  transfer  reactions.  The  ﬁnal  model  was  also  reported 
to be able to successfully capture the evolution of low molecular 
weight products (LMWPs) from experiments reported in the litera- 
ture [ 400 , 481 ]. The comparison of the simulation outputs with ex- 
perimental data from Bouster et al. [400] and Kim et al. [481] are 
presented in Fig. 45 . 

Different  reactor  conﬁgurations  at  T = 100 °C  were  adopted  in 
the experimental and modeling analysis on polystyrene by Levine 
and  Broadbelt  [464] .  The  model  was  validated  with  data  from 
previous  studies  as  reported  in  Fig.  46  [ 366 , 367 ],  and  Fig.  47 
[ 400 , 520 ]. This work is an extension of Broadbelt and coworkers’ 
previous modeling effort s on PS pyrolysis by constructing full poly- 
mer  MMDs  from  the  zeroth,  ﬁrst,  and  second  moments  tracked 
for each dead species [ 402 , 408 ]. The effect of the initial MMD on 
the evolution of the MMD was also investigated [464] . The authors 
crucially note that 4 of the 41 kinetic parameters were regressed to 
achieve these ﬁts: frequency factors for β-scission to low molec- 
ular weight species (LMWS), depropagation of 1,3-diphenylpropyl 
radical to monomer, 1,5-hydrogen shift, and 1,7-hydrogen shift. 

Kruse  et  al.  experimentally  analyzed  the  pyrolysis  of  PP  in  a 
batch reactor over a temperature range of 350–420 °C [403] . The 
simulated product distributions were reported to match well with

in Fig. 54 [468] . Conﬁrming the ﬁndings of Faravelli et al. [206] re- 
sults showed that the degradation rate of PS is unaffected by both 
the diffusion of low molecular weight PP radicals into PS and the 
diffusion of low molecular weight PS radicals into PP. The authors 
proposed that increasing the interfacial area between PS and PP 
through the premixing of the two polymers would further enhance 
the  PP  degradation  rate.  To  validate  this  claim,  solid-state  shear 
pulverization (SSSP) and binary compositional changes were used 
to manipulate the interfacial area between PS and PP during bi- 
nary pyrolysis. In comparison with the experimental data which 
employed no premixing, using SSSP to blend PS and PP was re- 
ported to result in a 25% increase in PP degradation rate. In order 
to incorporate this effect in their model, the authors increased the 
fraction of low molecular weight PS radicals that could diffuse into 
the PP from 0.037% to 0.10%. 

To sum up, the performance and ability of detailed kinetic mod- 
els of pyrolysis of polymers have advanced considerably in the last 
decades. An important contribution came from experimental stud- 
ies since the experimental results of polymer pyrolysis studies be- 
came  more  accurate  and  complete  over  time.  Experiments  were 
able to provide more detailed information on product distributions, 
which are indispensable for the validation of detailed kinetic mod- 
eling efforts. Additionally, with the help of accurate small-scale ex- 
perimental setups such as micro-pyrolyzers, kinetic data that can 
be  almost  called  intrinsic,  i.e.  they  are  not  affected  by  heat  and 
mass transfer limitations, was possible to obtain. As experiments 
started to provide extensive product distributions, researchers had 
the chance to expand the size and details involved in models. Im- 
provements in computer hardware and software also signiﬁcantly 
contributed  to  the  challenge  of  restricted  model  size.  Signiﬁcant 
advances in computational power and eﬃciency, together with the 
numerical  optimizations  of  the  solvers  used,  further  expand  the 
potential  size  of  forthcoming  detailed  kinetic  models.  With  the 
possibility to create more advanced and accurate detailed kinetic 
models, researchers have stronger tools to unravel underlying re- 
action mechanisms in the formation of speciﬁc products. It should 
be noted that there is still a lot of room for improvement in de- 
veloping detailed kinetic models of pyrolysis of polymers. Short- 
comings  of  existing  models  are  comprehended  in  greater  detail 
and researchers are embracing novel approaches to overcome these

(TPM) is described as a system which is composed of two com- 
pletely separate liquid phases, one in which a larger amount of PS 
is present and one where PE prevails. The authors state that the 
radicals generated are only active inside their own phase. The TPM 
produces a very good match between theoretical results and ex- 
periments since it considers the solubility of the polymers.

challenges.  General  comments  about  already  existing  approaches 
are beneﬁcial for assessing model performances. Firstly, it is im- 
portant to state that a kinetic model without population balances 
cannot predict macromolecule yields. Models based on MoM can 
overcome this shortcoming, but they are incompetent in predict- 
ing  the  chain  length  distribution  of  products.  This  is  crucial  for 
making use of extensive product information that can be obtained 
from novel experimental and analysis techniques. Secondly, using 
lumped models might be satisfactory for describing experimentally 
lumped data, but they do not allow much insight into the rele- 
vance  of  initiation  and  side  reactions.  Detailed  kinetic  modeling 
approaches like k MC allows to model initiation/side reactions ac- 
curately and has the ability to predict very small amounts of side 
products originating from such initiation/side reactions.

study  compared their  simulation  results  with  Olazar  et  al.’s  and 
Aguado et al.’s experimental results for pyrolysis of PS in a spouted 
bed [ 492 , 530 , 531 ]. The authors claimed that a satisfactory agree- 
ment was observed with a mean relative deviation of 0.8% [492] . 
A comparison of some modeling and experimental results can be 
seen in Fig. 55 . The model predictions for a scaled-up spouted bed 
demonstrated that due to the existence of an excellent gas-solid 
contact in spouted beds, the limitations imposed by heat and mass 
transfer were minimized. As a result of this, the bed was reported 
to be maintained under isothermal conditions. Another observation 
was that the inlet gas temperature highly affects the results of the 
model when compared with the effect of the mass of the initial 
plastic. The authors claimed that the total amount of inert parti- 
cles used can be reduced as long as the stable spouting of the bed 
is preserved. 

A comparison of modeling and experimental results for the lim- 
ited  number  of  studies  presented  in  Section  4.3  will  be  brieﬂy 
mentioned in this part. Modeling details of these studies can be

temperature and concentration conﬁrmed the excellent mixing of 
particles. Additionally, the inlet gas temperature and the mass of 
PET highly affect PET conversion. A comparison of some modeling 
and experimental results can be seen in Fig. 56 . Also, the amount 
of inert particles has a negligible effect on the conversion and can 
be reduced as long as a stable spouting of the bed is preserved. 
The gas ﬂow alone suﬃced to eliminate the external heat and mass 
transfer limitations, so it can be reduced to the minimum value to 
decrease compressor energy consumption. 

In Yin et al.’s 2019 study on mixed plastic (PE:PP:PS = 24:9:8), 
the comparisons show that the modiﬁed model can be used to pre- 
dict the ﬂow process of the liquid ﬁlm more accurately [495] . A 
comparison of the values for the average thickness of the liquid 
ﬁlm of co-current ﬂow between modeling and experimental results 
can be seen in Fig. 57 . It was reported that the surface of the liquid 
ﬁlm was a wavy structure and the liquid ﬁlm presents a compre- 
hensive ﬂow pattern of ﬁlm, rivulet, and droplet. The authors con- 
cluded that with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the length 
of the liquid ﬁlm and the average apparent heat transfer coeﬃcient 
decreased, and the average thickness increased slightly. Addition- 
ally, with the increase of the liquid ﬁlm inlet velocity, the liquid 
ﬁlm thickness, and the average apparent heat transfer coeﬃcient 
increased. 

5.2. Analysis of micro-, meso–, and macro-scale phenomena 

Critical  discussion  and  analysis  of  micro-,  meso–,  and 
macroscale  phenomena  in  the  scope  of  polymer  degradation 
(depolymerization)  will  offer  imperative  directions  for  future 
research activities, both in the experimental and modeling ﬁelds. 
With the advent of high-performance computing, there is a large 
potential for revisiting earlier studies for expanding the reaction 
networks  and  detailing  the  models  for  mass  and  heat  transfer 
phenomena via, for example, CFD. In order to avoid some of the 
complications  encountered  in  preceding  studies,  critical  analysis 
of  recent  advances  in  adjacent  (interdisciplinary)  research  ﬁelds, 
e.g.  (i)  chemical  kinetics  (or  kinetic  modeling),  (ii)  high-level 
experimental  characterization  devices,  (iii)  theoretical  chemistry 
/  quantum  chemistry  /  ab-initio  calculations,  (iv)  computational 
ﬂuid  dynamics,  (v)  computational  sciences,  (vi)  computational 
infrastructure  (hardware),  (vii)  reactor  engineering/design,  (viii) 

polymer chemistry is needed. For instance, a closer collaboration 
between the ﬁelds of polymer chemistry and pyrolysis kinetics can 
greatly help to get a better understanding of the molecular scale 
and the role of composition. Furthermore, advances in theoretical 
chemistry can provide more accurate rate parameters to be used 
in the kinetic models. Progress in high-level experimental charac- 
terization devices will offer more comprehensive and accurate data 
to validate simulations. Advancements in computational hardware 
and methods will enable us to solve more complex models in a 
shorter  amount  of  time.  Future  collaborations  of  scientists  from 
these  adjacent  ﬁelds  have  the  potential  to  shed  some  light  on 
questions raised in detailed kinetic modeling of plastic pyrolysis. 
Additionally,  the  improvement  in  the  understanding  of  micro-, 
meso– and macroscale phenomena will directly aid in the better 
development of multiscale models and hence reactor design. The 
representation  of  the  phenomena  taking  place  in  micro-,  meso–
and  macro-scale  together  with  their  interactions  can  be  seen  in 
Fig. 58 . 

5.2.1. Neat polymer feedstocks 

The ultimate aim for creating the detailed kinetic models, and 
thus complete overall process models, is increasing the level of de- 
tail in multiscale models using chemical reaction engineering sci- 
ence. In order to accomplish this, more detailed descriptions and 
analysis of  the  phenomena taking  place  on  each  physical length 
scale is needed. 

It  is  critical  to  note  that  the  microscale  phenomena  and  its 
consequences in polymer degradation are still not perfectly under- 
stood even after more than 70 years of active research in the ﬁeld 
[ 500 , 533–538 ]. One of the most crucial elements is the elementary 
reactions taking place during pyrolysis and the corresponding ki- 
netics. As discussed above, it is widely accepted in the ﬁeld that 
the  pyrolysis  of  plastics  involves  hundreds/thousands  of  species 
and reactions in large and complex free-radical reaction networks 
[ 345 , 391–393 ]. The reaction families inside this free-radical mech- 
anism  are  also  quite  well-deﬁned  in  the  literature  [ 6 , 345 , 391–
393 , 496 ].  However,  the  importance  of  speciﬁc  reactions  within 
these reaction families in the case of speciﬁc polymers is not en- 
tirely unraveled. If all possible reactions from all reactions families 
for all species and intermediates are taken into account, detailed 
kinetic models approach towards an unmanageable size, and that

example,  accounting  for  the  liquid  environment.  Additionally,  as 
mentioned before, the distinction between apparent and intrinsic 
kinetics is crucial for using experimental data in the determina- 
tion of kinetic rate parameters. Heat and mass transfer limitations 
of experimental setups should be carefully assessed using the ap- 
proaches mentioned in Section 4.4. 

The  mass  transport  limitations  in  the  microscale  can  have 
decisive  outcomes,  especially  for  terminations  of  radical  species. 
Macromolecules  need  to  diffuse  within  and  between  different 
phases  in  order  to  terminate.  It  is  widely  accepted  in  the  lit- 
erature  that  the  mutual  termination  of  radicals  in  pyrolyzing 
melts  is  diffusion-controlled  and  thus  termination  reactions  dis- 
play large apparent activation energies [ 497 , 539 , 540 ]. This molecu- 
lar diffusion-controlled termination originates from the large resis- 
tance for mass transport due to the large viscosity in the melt (vis- 
cous liquid) phase. This was illustrated by Buchanan and Britt us- 
ing silica-immobilized hydrocarbons [541] . The authors concluded 
that  the  termination  reactions  between  diffusionally  constrained 
radicals  are  hindered.  In  contrast,  it  is  stated  that  the  inter- 
molecular hydrogen transfer processes between diffusionally con- 
strained  species  can  be  effortless.  Nonetheless,  the  authors  also 
state that the H-transfer of such radicals is thought to strongly de- 
pend on the distance between, and the orientation of, the partici- 
pating species. It is further postulated that under optimum hydro- 
gen transfer conditions, rapid serial hydrogen transfers can occur 
and provide a means for radical sites to be translocated in the ma- 
trix without the need for physical diffusion [541] . 

26 H 

Another  underappreciated  phenomenon  on  the  microscale  is 
the  onset  of  degradation  and  the  presence  of  weak-links.  Oakes 
and Richards state that the onset for thermal degradation of HDPE 
can  start  at  temperatures  as  low  as  330 °C,  whereas  hexacosane 
54 ) is stable in the absence of a catalyst at 390 °C [542] . This 
(C 
2 –CH 
is  an  indication  of  normal  CH 
2  links  not  being  the  center 
of thermal scissions and infrared analysis conﬁrms that there are 
chain links in ethylene polymers that differ from the normal paraf- 
ﬁnic carbon-carbon link [542] . Possible weak link examples include 
bonds adjacent to carbonyl or other oxygen-containing groups de- 
rived from the polymerization catalyst or from trace impurities in 
the  monomer.  Other  potential  weak  links  are  those  adjacent  to 
branches in the polymer chain. These considerations are quite sig- 
niﬁcant for determining the initiation rate coeﬃcient values, which 
are extremely hard to obtain using ab-initio calculations. 

Another  aspect  regarding  the  thermal  random  scission  of  the 
backbone  of  PE  molecules  is  examined  by  Smith  et  al.  by  using 
Reactive Molecular Dynamics calculations [543] . The authors sug- 
gest that although thermal bond scissions occur at every location 
in the chain, there are some higher (and lower) energy bonds that 
break with greater (less) frequency. They postulate that it would be 
possible for some bonds to break more frequently than others be- 
cause of accumulated localized strain in the backbone. It is stated 
that the common practice of employing rate coeﬃcients obtained 
from measurements made on small, gas-phase molecules in kinetic 
models of the thermal decomposition of polymers (comprised of 
similar bonds and functionalities) can result in signiﬁcant errors 
[543] . Molecular dynamics modeling results of Knyazev also con- 
ﬁrm that alkane chain length has a pronounced effect on the rate 
of backbone C –C dissociation [544] . This further underlines the rel- 
evance of accounting for chain-length-dependent kinetics for ele- 
mentary reactions. 

The incorporation of more than one phase becomes important 
in the analysis of mesoscale phenomena. Mesoscale is used to de- 
ﬁne the length scale bigger than the molecular scale but not as big 
as the reactor scale. For example, evaporation is a physical phe- 
nomenon  that  is  relevant  to  the  mesoscale.  Consequently,  a  py- 
rolysis  process  model  should  capture  the  presence  of  solid,  liq- 
uid, and gas phases simultaneously. As mentioned before, Faravelli

is why this information is crucial. In addition, even with the high- 
est level of detail present in the available models in the literature 
nowadays, we still cannot adequately capture the time-resolved ex- 
perimental proﬁles. Currently available detailed kinetic models are 
able to capture certain individual experimental datasets, however, 
there exists no detailed kinetic model that can simulate a wide va- 
riety of experimental data. When assessing the performance of a 
model, it is important to make the distinction between ‘one exper- 
imental dataset’ and ‘the true chemistry represented by all avail- 
able data in the literature’. The inadequacy to represent the true 
chemistry highlights the need for an increase in the total number 
of possible reactions deﬁned in detailed reaction mechanisms. New 
elementary reaction possibilities can be incorporated by careful in- 
vestigation of already existing mechanisms and completing missing 
parts, and by designing ad hoc experiments to provide pieces of 
evidence of hidden phenomena ultimately resulting in missing ki- 
netic steps ( e.g. polymer/polymer interactions). Another crucial ex- 
tension will be the incorporation of chain-length-dependent kinet- 
ics into these reaction families, which was proven by Kruse et al. to 
have signiﬁcant effects [408] . The next step in the molecular aspect 
can be the application of model reduction techniques after reach- 
ing the full-detail level. This will make the models more ﬂexible 
and less computationally expensive. Thus, these reduced-detailed 
models can be potentially coupled with CFD models to predict re- 
actor behavior. By doing this, the interaction and collaboration be- 
tween different scales (micro-, meso–, and macroscale) would also 
be reﬁned. Another crucial aspect of the microscale phenomena is 
the determination of rate coeﬃcient values. Ab-initio calculations, 
which,  to  the  authors’  knowledge,  have  never  been  extensively 
used in polymer degradation research, are indispensable tools for 
calculating rate coeﬃcients. Although some authors pay attention 
to the distinction between gas-phase and melt-phase (viscous liq- 
uid) kinetic rate coeﬃcients, it is common (yet unfortunate) to see 
gas-phase values being directly used without any corrections, for

tion 4.4. Evidently, this will notably increase the complexity of the 
models and the computational cost. 

One instance of mass transfer between phases is the volatiliza- 
tion  of  LMWPs  from  the  viscous  melt-phase  into  the  gas-phase 
during  pyrolysis.  The  implications  of  the  competition  between 
degradation and evaporation have already been discussed in Sec- 
tion 4.4. Clearly, volatilization is a decisive mesoscale mass trans- 
fer phenomenon and needs to be captured in simulations. A pre- 
requisite for this advancement is establishing an accurate descrip- 
tion  of  the  volatilization  rate  of  different  molecules  making  use 
of a rate law form, in analogy with chemical kinetics and phys- 
ical  phenomena.  As  mentioned  before,  the  incorporation  of  the 
volatilization concept in the pyrolysis of polymers has far-reaching 
effects  since  it  means  removing  LMWPs  from  the  reactive  envi- 
ronment. This will aid in decreasing the liquid-phase concentra- 
tions of smaller molecules which will affect the degradation kinet- 
ics. Without the incorporation of volatilization, the residence time 
distribution of every molecule is assumed to be uniform regard- 
less  of  their  size  and  this  can  be  misleading.  As  a  result  of  the 
direct effect of volatilization on species concentrations, it can be 
speculated that extending models with this aspect can have major 
consequences on what researchers are using as kinetics and those 
that correspond to reality. As stated before, an approach to model 
the volatilization behavior was presented by Faravelli et al. using 
the formation of bubbles [432] . It can be conceived that volatile 
components in the melt-phase get together to form some bubbles 
in the mesoscale. Then these bubbles will leave the melt phase, 

Fig. 57.  Comparison of values for the average thickness of the liquid ﬁlm of co- 
current ﬂow (adopted from [495] ). 

et al.’s inclusion of bubble formation during pyrolysis is one of the 
ﬁrst attempts to account for this [432] . However, asides from this 
model, the integration of mesoscale phenomena in kinetic model- 
ing is completely missing in polymer degradation literature. Un- 
mistakably, additional complexities arise in a multi-phase model, 
as the heat and mass transfer between the phases and the trans- 
port  within these  phases  also  need  to  be  captured,  as  indicated 
by the discussion around dimensionless numbers presented in Sec- 

56

aided by the difference of densities of the two phases, by being 
transported  to  the  surface.  It  can  be  speculated  that  the  forma- 
tion  of  bubbles  will  enhance  the  rate  of  mass  transport  within 
the melt phase compared to individual molecules diffusing through 
the melt. In this context the physical properties and in particular, 
the vapor-liquid equilibria in these systems need to be well under- 
stood. Today this is not the case. 

Heat  management,  temperature,  and  concentration  gradients 
on  the  reactor  scale,  ﬂow  pattern,  and  non-ideality  are  impor- 
tant phenomena on the macroscale. One important contribution to 
multiscale modeling is reconciling the computational cost of the 
macroscale model layer ( e.g. CFD) by sacriﬁcing detail on the mi- 
croscale model layer, i.e. via applying model reduction on the reac- 
tion mechanisms [ 328 , 422 , 496 ]. In this way, insurmountable com- 
putational cost no longer prohibits the development of new reactor 
technology/geometry for the pyrolysis/gasiﬁcation of polymers. For 
instance, keeping the goal of CFD implementation in mind, Gas- 
coin et al. ﬁrst reduced their HDPE pyrolysis mechanism from a 
detailed model of 7541 reactions and 1014 species to a reduced 
model of 1713 reactions and 472 species [470] . Then the authors 
have implemented their reduced mechanism in a multiscale model 
of a hybrid rocket engine that uses HDPE as solid fuel [545] . These 
multiscale models can greatly help in selecting the optimal reac- 
tor type and conditions for speciﬁc feedstocks. A careful analysis 
is required on the macroscale to decide on a conﬁguration that fa- 
cilitates optimal mass and heat transfer. It should be noted that 
temperature and concentration gradients will exist in an actual re- 
actor in both the microscale and the macroscale. Thus it is crucial 
to improve the model description of heat, mass, and momentum 
transfer/limitations  in  order  to  fully  capture  the  interactions  be- 
tween the three length scales. Additionally, with the help of com- 
prehensive multiphase CFD models, it will be possible to evaluate 
the effects of viscosity inside the reactor. In addition, for reactors 
involving screws or stirrers, the shear rate will also be a signiﬁcant 

contributor to heating the reactor and possibly to the rate of radi- 
cal generation. An additional complexity brought in the macroscale 
can be the selection of a homogeneous vs . pseudo-homogeneous 
model regarding the distinction between the bubble phase and the 
melt phase. A pseudo-homogeneous model involves a single phase 
but describes a reality involving two phases. Most models found 
in the literature are homogeneous and isothermal since gradients 
within the considered single phase is omitted both for temperature 
and concentrations. Once again, the only exception is the bubble 
phase heterogeneity in the work of Faravelli et al. [432] . 

5.2.2. Mixed polymer feedstocks 

All of the characteristics presented for the neat polymer feed- 
stocks are also applicable for mixed polymers since they consist of 
individual components. However, it can be expected that there will 
be some additional mixing effect which will further shape these 
characteristics. 

Two  different  approaches  exist  for  describing  feedstock  mix- 
ing  in  the  literature  as  of  now.  As  explained  in  Section  4.2.3.5 
and  4.2.3.6,  Faravelli  et  al.  [206]  analyzed  PE  and  PS  mixtures 
while Kruse et al. [468] studied PP and PS mixtures. In Faravelli 
et al.’s approach, two different non-compartmental models, namely 
CMM and CSM, are deduced as explained above. These two mod- 
els  assume  the  extent  of  mixing  between  two  polymer  phases 
but  they  do  not  account  for  separate  phases  with  mass  transfer 
between  them.  The  TPM  overcomes  this  shortcoming  by  assum- 
ing that the system is composed of two completely separate liq- 
uid  phases  [206] .  Kruse  et  al.’s  [468]  study  also  takes  a  similar 
compartmental approach to deﬁne the interactions between two 
phases. In this work, a fraction of LMWRs of each polymer type 
was allowed to diffuse into the other polymer phase. This fraction 
was an adjustable parameter in the model and ﬁtted to experimen- 
tal results. Two different approaches exist for describing feedstock 
mixing in the literature.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100901 

Compared to neat polymer feedstocks, additional phases of in- 
dividual polymers and a mixed melt phase (or boundary) should 
be deﬁned within the liquid phase, in addition to the solid and gas 
phase. Accounting for the heat and mass transfer between these 
phases  will  prove  to  be  even  more  cumbersome,  but  the  syner- 
gistic effects of polymer mixtures can only be captured using this 
detailed approach. The decision between a homogeneous vs . het- 
erogeneous model becomes even more crucial in the pyrolysis of 
polymer mixtures. The choice should lean towards a heterogeneous 
model since we expect the extent of mixing between two polymer 
phases to be limited. If these detailed heterogeneous multiphase 
models (with the help of CFD) can be created, the optimal reac- 
tor choice and conditions can be undoubtedly deduced for differ- 
ent mixtures of polymers. Today this is not possible yet but several 
research groups in the world are working on this. 

Despite all previous effort s, as of now, there is no detailed ki- 
netic model to perfectly describe the pyrolysis behavior of real-life 
SPW. As explained in Section 5.2.1 in detail, a ﬁrst step should be 
constructing a detailed kinetic model for a neat polymer with a 
high maximum allowed chain length and a molar mass distribu- 
tion (MMD). After a successful advanced model for a neat poly- 
mer is constructed, the same methodology can be systematically 
repeated  for  all  important polymer  types  found  in  real-life SPW 
streams. These works are currently underway in the research com- 
munity and in our research group. After the individual detailed ki- 
netic models show satisfying results, the cross-reactions convert- 
ing different polymers in the models of polymer mixtures should 
be implemented as well as incorporating the synergistic and mix- 
ing effects. Finally, in order to thoroughly resolve the temporal and 
spatial evolution of the complete process in molecular-detail, the 
developed detailed kinetic models should be combined with reac- 
tor, ﬂow, and compositional models. In particular, the last point is 
not  easy  to  address  in  terms  of  how  can  the  input  composition 
be provided to these detailed models. Therefore the work done in 
petroleum  and  petrochemical  processes  can  be  an  inspiration  to 
come up with compositional modeling tools [ 511 , 512 , 546–548 ]. 

6. Conclusions and perspectives 

This work analyzes chemical recycling from a holistic and en- 
gineering/multiscale  perspective.  This  extensive  review  identiﬁes 
critical  gaps  in  the  literature  with  the  aim  of  directing  model- 
ing  and  experimental  research  in  an  adequate  path  by  suggest- 
ing  which  novel  experimental  and  computational  techniques  are 
needed in the coming decade to facilitate a smoother and faster 
transition  to  a  circular  carbon  economy.  If  rapidly  implemented, 
pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation processes will directly aid in a decrease 
in greenhouse gas emissions of more than 100 million tonnes CO 
2 - 
eq. worldwide. First, an improved understanding of the underlying 
chemistry of chemical recycling is needed next to innovative reac- 
tor designs. Linking feedstock composition, reactor type, and oper- 
ating conditions to SPW degradation and product distribution by 
means of mathematical modeling will drive the design and opti- 
mization of pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation processes allowing to recy- 
cle any plastic waste stream, sorted or not sorted. From a scale-up 
perspective, the optimal design of the ‘most suitable’ reactor in an 
industrially relevant context can only be achieved by bridging the 
kinetics, ﬂuid dynamics, transport phenomena, and reactor mod- 
eling aspects in pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation technologies. As under- 
lined in this review, the complexity of chemical recycling of SPW 
starts with the complexity of the feedstock, i.e. a multicomponent 
mixture with blending partners, such as multiple (co)polymers, ad- 
ditives, and contaminants, and with the large number of reactions 
and species needed to describe the chemical phenomena. An ex- 
tensive characterization of the SPW feedstock to unravel the ex- 
act amounts and microstructure (in particular the MMD) of each 

polymer species is an important prerequisite if one wants to use 
detailed modeling approaches. Additionally, the ﬁrst step in the ki- 
netic modeling progress should be pinpointing all the inﬂuential 
species and reaction families to be able to shed light on the im- 
portant pathways involved in the formation of products. In parallel, 
the intrinsic rate coeﬃcients of elementary reaction steps should 
be determined with higher accuracy to unravel the dominant reac- 
tion pathways. Obtaining truly intrinsic kinetic data is crucial be- 
cause apparent kinetic data limits the applicability of kinetic mod- 
els in terms of different experimental conditions a new set of ap- 
parent kinetic data should be collected and for every new set of 
experimental conditions. 

Experimental  data  are  essential  for  shedding  light  on  such  a 
complex process and for the validation of created models. To this 
extent, a crucial ﬁrst step in chemical recycling research is improv- 
ing the quality of experimental data regarding their accuracy, in- 
tegrity, validity, and completeness. Although there have been im- 
portant advancements in experimental and characterization tech- 
niques, there is still room for improvement for higher quality and 
more  complete  experimental  datasets.  It  is  crucial  to  note  that 
there  is  still  a  need  for  more  extensive  product  characterization 
and a 100% (or close to 100%) mass balance. Ideally, NMR charac- 
terization should be performed for analyzing the defects and ini- 
tiator  fragments  present  in  the  structure.  For  characterizing  the 
branching present in the structure, g-factors should be evaluated 
by measuring the radius of gyration. More accurate GPC measure- 
ments ( e.g. Triple Detection SEC/GPC) are crucial for characteriz- 
ing the time-evolution of the MMD of degrading polymers. Spec- 
iﬁcation of important experimental conditions, such as the MMD 
or other properties of the plastic feedstock, would ensure the re- 
peatability of experiments. Unfortunately, these are not discreetly 
speciﬁed in many experimental studies. Besides, more systematic 
studies that compare different polymer feedstocks in a single ex- 
perimental setup in addition to comparing the same polymer feed- 
stocks  in  different  experimental  setups  would  be  very  valuable. 
The identiﬁcation of important pathways involved in the formation 
and disappearance of products as well as the inﬂuence of possi- 
ble interactions between polymers (or between polymers and ad- 
ditives or inorganics) can only be achieved through accurate and 
systematic experimental investigations, supported and assisted by 
advances  in  model  development.  Heat  and  mass  transfer  limita- 
tions should be also assessed in a more rigorous way to better de- 
scribe the three-phase nature of chemical recycling. This is an im- 
portant deﬁciency of models available in the literature at present. 
Ideally, the effects of heat and mass transfer should be accounted 
for explicitly in contrast to using apparent kinetics. This will pave 
the way for establishing accurate detailed kinetic models that can 
successfully simulate the full product distribution without needing 
experimental data at/around the same operating conditions. This is 
especially valuable for scale-up studies, where some process con- 
ditions cannot be trivially replicated using experiments. 

It should be noted that there is still a lot of room for improve- 
ment in developing detailed kinetic models of pyrolysis of poly- 
mers. Firstly, it is important to state that a kinetic model without 
population balances cannot predict macromolecule yields. Models 
based on MoM can overcome this shortcoming, but they are in- 
competent in predicting the chain length distribution of products. 
This is crucial for making use of extensive product information that 
can be obtained from novel experimental and analysis techniques. 
Secondly, using lumped models might be satisfactory for describ- 
ing experimentally lumped data, but they do not allow much in- 
sight into the relevance of initiation and side reactions. Detailed ki- 
netic modeling approaches like k MC allows to model initiation/side 
reactions  accurately  and  has  the  ability  to  predict  very  small 
amounts  of  side  products  originating  from  such  initiation/side 
reactions.

The ultimate goal of polymer degradation research in the con- 
text of chemical recycling is to simulate the conversion of real SPW 
feedstocks at the industrial scale. Despite all previous effort s, as of 
now, there is no detailed kinetic model to perfectly describe the 
pyrolysis behavior of real-life SPW. A good starting point for creat- 
ing a detailed and accurate polymer degradation model would be 
using a monodisperse polymer model compound with a relatively 
short chain length. When this model is assembled and validated 
with experimental data, it can be expanded ﬁrstly by increasing 
the maximum allowed chain length and then introducing a mo- 
lar mass distribution (MMD) to the well-deﬁned input with a high 
maximum chain length. After a successful model for a neat poly- 
mer is constructed, the same methodology can be systematically 
repeated  for  all  important polymer  types  found  in  real-life SPW 
streams. Another big step in simulating the pyrolysis of real-life 
SPW is integrating the cross-reactions when converting different 
polymers  in  the  models  of  polymer  mixtures.  This  advancement 
is crucial to capture the interactions (mixing effects) between dif- 
ferent  polymers  found  in  the  mixture.  Finally,  to  thoroughly  re- 
solve the temporal and spatial evolution of the complete process 
in molecular-detail, the developed detailed kinetic models should 
be combined with reactor, ﬂow, and compositional models. 

Different  types  of  plastics  can  be  better  suited  for  particu- 
lar  types  of  chemical  recycling  techniques.  The  optimal  decision 
should  also  be  based  on  the  desired  product  spectrum.  For  in- 
stance,  converting  waste  polyoleﬁns  into  valuable  hydrocarbon 
products  with  a  very  wide  range  of  carbon  numbers  is  quite 
straightforward via pyrolysis. Depending on the choice of the reac- 
tor and operating conditions, the product distribution can be tar- 
geted towards a certain fraction like gas, oils, or waxes. In contrast, 
Some polymers like PS, PA, PET, and PMMA are more suited for 
producing  monomers  using  chemical  recycling.  Furthermore,  de- 
pending on the end-use target for the chemically recycled prod- 
uct, different solvent extraction approaches can be preferred over 
other chemical recycling techniques for the recycling of PET. Chem- 
ical recycling of complex polymer mixtures becomes very compli- 
cated because of the mixing and synergistic effects. 

To  tackle  the  aforementioned  problems  and  challenges,  inno- 
vative  experimental  ( e.g.  detailed  feedstock  and  product  charac- 
terization using comprehensive chromatographic techniques with 
advanced, selective detectors in combination with photoionization 
mass spectrometry for measuring radical concentrations) and com- 
putational  ( e.g.  kinetic  Monte  Carlo,  liquid  phase,  and  heteroge- 
neous theoretical kinetics) techniques are needed. This will allow 
increasing the selectivity towards monomers from the current 40% 
level to potentially 60 or 70%. It will also help in designing novel 
reactors  with  substantially  improved  heat/mass  transfer  eﬃcien- 
cies, and thus higher yields, so that the economics of chemical re- 
cycling improves.

ulate matter. The development of such models strongly rely on theoretical calcula- 
tions of rate constants through ab initio methods, also implemented in automatic 
routines allowing the calculation of a large number of accurate parameters for dif- 
ferent reaction classes of interest for pyrolysis and combustion processes. 

Ruben Van de Vijver obtained his Master of Science in 
Chemical Engineering degree from Ghent University in 
2013. He joined the Laboratory for Chemical Technology 
to pursue a PhD in Chemical Engineering the same year 
after obtaining a personal research grant from the Flem- 
ish government. His-PhD research focused on automatic 
kinetic model generation for pyrolysis and oxidation reac- 
tions. More speciﬁcally, he implemented on-the-ﬂy quan- 
tum chemistry calculations during kinetic model genera- 
tion to calculate kinetic parameters of chemical reactions. 
He defended his PhD thesis successfully in 2017. After his 
PhD, he spent 1 year as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
Combustion Research Facility at Sandia National Labora- 
tories in Livermore, California on the development of software to explore poten- 
tial energy surfaces and identify kinetically relevant saddle points. He returned 
to the Laboratory for Chemical Technology and obtained a personal postdoctoral 
grant from the Flemish government. His-current postdoctoral research includes au- 
tomatic kinetic model generation of heterogeneous catalyzed reactions and pyroly- 
sis of biomass and plastic waste. 

Paul H.M. Van Steenberge ( °1984) focuses his research 
on multiscale modeling of polymerizations in homoge- 
neous (bulk, solution) and heterogeneous (liquid-liquid 
dispersions  or  precipitation,  gas-liquid)  media,  aiming 
both at collaborations with industry toward scaling up 
sustainable production or recycling processes as well as 
collaborations with academia toward novel polymeric ma- 
terials. He has co-authored over 57 peer-reviewed full 
length research articles in top journals (incl. Progress in 
Polymer  Science  and  Nature  Communications),  1  book 
chapter and 60 presentations at international conferences.

Tiziano  Faravelli  Prof.  Tiziano  Faravelli  is  a  fellow  of 
the Combustion Institute. His-researches are mainly de- 
voted to the chemical reaction engineering of complex 
systems at Politecnico di Milano. The CRECK modeling 
group, where he is an active research member, devel- 
ops detailed models for the pyrolysis, partial oxidation 
and combustion of both traditional and renewable fuels, 
i.e. bio-gas, bio-oil and biomass. Detailed kinetic mech- 
anisms are available for gas, liquid and solid fuels. Par- 
ticularly, this activity focuses on pollutant formation, like 
NOx, SOx, PAHs and soot, from all thermal processes. Re- 
cent attention has moved to the study of circular econ- 
omy applied to the chemical recycle of waste and espe- 
cially of plastics. Detailed models of the biomass and polymer pyrolysis and gasiﬁ- 
cation have been proposed and are continuously developed and updated. Together 
with the chemical modeling at the molecular scale, he works on understanding 
the physical phenomena at the mesoscale. This activity refers to the investigation 
of solid-gas interactions in particles, or the multiphase gas-liquid ﬂow of isolated 
droplets or of bubbles in liquid streams.
