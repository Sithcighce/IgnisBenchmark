    "question_text": "Explain how flame stretch affects the measurement of laminar burning velocity in spherical flame propagation method, and discuss the differences between linear and nonlinear stretch correction models.",
    "standard_answer": "Flame stretch affects laminar burning velocity measurements through two primary mechanisms: curvature and hydrodynamic strain. For spherical flames, stretch rate is defined as K=2Sb/rf, where Sb is stretched flame speed and rf is flame radius. Linear models like Markstein's (Sb/S0b = 1-LbK) assume small stretch effects and Le≈1, but can overestimate burning velocities by up to 60% for non-unity Lewis number mixtures (Wu et al., 2015). Nonlinear models (e.g., Kelley & Law's quasi-steady model) account for higher-order terms: ln(Sb/S0b) = -2LbK/S0b + 4(LbK/S0b)^2. The key difference lies in their applicability - linear models fail for lean H2/air (Le<1) and rich heptane/air (Le>1) flames, while nonlinear models better capture the curvature effects. Experimental data shows linear extrapolation gives SL=40cm/s for CH4/air while nonlinear gives 37cm/s, highlighting the importance of proper stretch correction.",

    "standard_answer": "From Mallard-Le Chatelier's thermal theory, laminar burning velocity depends on reaction rate (SL ∝ √RR). For Arrhenius kinetics RR = k[C]^n = BT^γexp(-Ea/RT)[C]^n. The pressure dependence emerges because concentration [C] ∝ P: SL ∝ √(P^nT^γexp(-Ea/RT)). At constant temperature, this simplifies to SL ∝ P^(n/2). However, incorporating density effects (ρ ∝ P) and flame thickness (δ ∝ 1/P), the complete relation becomes SL ∝ P^(n/2-1). For typical hydrocarbon flames where n≈1.5-2: when n=2 (bimolecular), SL becomes pressure-independent (b=0); for n=1, SL ∝ P^-0.5. This explains why most hydrocarbons show decreasing SL with pressure (negative b). Experimental data confirms b ranges from -0.3 to -0.5 for CH4/air flames across different equivalence ratios.",

    "standard_answer": "The temperature exponent α in SL ∝ T^α shows fundamentally different behavior for lean H2/air due to kinetic mechanisms. For stoichiometric mixtures (φ=1), α≈1.6-1.8 as dominated by H+O2=OH+O (Chain-branching). In lean flames (φ<0.5), α increases to 3-5 because: 1) Reduced flame temperatures shift equilibrium towards radicals (H/O/OH), increasing sensitivity to temperature. 2) The third-body recombination reaction H+O2+M=HO2+M becomes dominant, whose rate has stronger T dependence (-d[OH]/dt ∝ T^-1.3P^2). 3) Differential diffusion effects are magnified at low φ. Experimental data confirms α=1.57 at φ=1 but reaches α=5 at φ=0.4 (Alekseev et al., 2015). This nonlinear response explains why simple power-law correlations fail for lean H2 flames and requires detailed kinetic modeling.",

    "standard_answer": "The heat flux method stabilizes flat flames on perforated plates with external heating to cancel heat losses (de Goey et al., 1993). Advantages: 1) No stretch correction needed (intrinsically stretch-free). 2) Direct measurement of adiabatic SL. 3) Better accuracy (±1 cm/s). Limitations: 1) Maximum measurable SL~80 cm/s (limited by flow stabilization). 2) Practically limited to P≤10 atm due to flame stabilization challenges. Spherical flame method propagates flames in constant pressure/vessels. Advantages: 1) Capable of P>60 atm (Tse et al., 2000). 2) Wider SL range measurable. Limitations: 1) Requires complex stretch corrections (±5-60% uncertainty). 2) Susceptible to cellular instabilities at high P. 3) Needs large vessels (>15cm) for minimal confinement effects. For high-P studies (>10 atm), spherical flames remain the only viable option despite higher uncertainties.",

    "standard_answer": "The dilution effect combines thermal and chemical mechanisms. Thermal effect: CO2 increases mixture heat capacity (Cp_CO2=37 J/mol-K vs Cp_N2=29). For 30% CO2 replacing N2, adiabatic flame temp Tad decreases by ~200K (from ~2200K to ~2000K). Using SL ∝ exp(-Ea/2RTad) with Ea≈160 kJ/mol, this gives SL reduction by factor exp[(-160000/2R)(1/2000-1/2200)]≈0.7. Chemical effect: CO2 participates in CO+OH⇌CO2+H, scavenging OH radicals. Kinetic modeling shows additional 10-15% reduction beyond thermal effect. Total reduction = 0.7 (thermal) × 0.85 (chemical) ≈ 0.6. For baseline SL=36 cm/s (CH4/air), predicted SL≈22 cm/s. Experimental data confirms ~35-40% reduction for 30% CO2 dilution (Galmiche et al., 2011), validating this calculation.",
