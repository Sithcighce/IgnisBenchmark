This review presents and discusses the progress in combining fast pyrolysis and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation
(HDO) to produce liquid fuel from solid, lignocellulosic biomass. Fast pyrolysis of biomass is a well-developed
technology for bio-oil production at mass yields up to »75%, but a high oxygen content of 35(cid:1)50 wt%
strongly limits its potential as transportation fuel. Catalytic HDO can be used to upgrade fast pyrolysis bio-
oil, as oxygenates react with hydrogen to produce a stable hydrocarbon fuel and water, which is removed by
separation. Research on HDO has been carried out for more than 30 years with increasing intensity over the
past decades. Several catalytic systems have been tested, and we conclude that single stage HDO of con-
densed bio-oil is unsuited for commercial scale bio-oil upgrading, as the coking and polymerization, which
occurs upon re-heating of the bio-oil, rapidly deactivates the catalyst and plugs the reactor. Dual or multiple
stage HDO has shown more promising results, as the most reactive oxygenates can be stabilized at low tem-
perature prior to deep HDO for full deoxygenation. Catalytic fast hydropyrolysis, which combines fast pyroly-
sis with catalytic HDO in a single reactor, eliminates the need for reheating condensed bio-oil, lowers side
reactions, and produces a stable oil with oxygen content, H/C ratio, and heating value comparable to fossil
fuels. We address several challenges, which must be overcome for continuous catalytic fast hydropyrolysis to
become commercially viable, with the most urgent issues being: (i) optimization of operating conditions
(temperature, H2 pressure, and residence time) and catalyst formulation to maximize oil yield and minimize
cracking, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation, (ii) development of an improved process design and reac-
tor configuration to allow for continuous operation including pressurized biomass feeding, fast entrainment
and collection of char, which is catalytically active for side reactions, efficient condensation of the produced
oil, and utilization and/or integration of by-products (non-condensable gasses and char), and (iii) long-term
tests with respect to catalyst stability and possible pathways for regeneration. By reviewing past and current
research from fast pyrolysis and catalytic HDO, we target a discussion of the combined processes, including
direct catalytic fast hydropyrolysis. By critically evaluating their potential and challenges, we finally conclude,
which future steps are necessary for these processes to become industrially feasible.

1. Introduction

Today's production and use of energy is responsible for 60% of the
global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (2016 number) [1]. With an
increasing world population and the continued industrialization of
developing countries the energy consumption will keep increasing
in the near future [2(cid:1)4]. In addition, the depletion of fossil resources
and the wide awareness of anthropogenic global warming have
intensified the search for renewable and sustainable energy resour-
ces that can support our modern way of living [5].

The increase in the anthropogenic CO2 emissions can be
traced back to the industrialization that accelerated through the
20th century [5]. In 2010, CO2 released from fossil fuels and
industrial processes constituted 65% of anthropogenic GHGs
emitted [5]. Regarding the total GHG emissions, the transport
sector contributed to 14% with the energy supply sector covering
35%, industry 21%, agriculture and forestry 24%, and buildings
6%, respectively [5]. In 2016, 20% of the human population still
lived outside the electrical grid and around 40% relied on wood,
coal, or animal waste for cooking and heating [1]. This is
expected to change and, hence, as projected by the U.S. Energy
Administration in 2016, the global energy consumption of non-
increase significantly from 330 ¢ 106 TJ in
OECD countries will
2012 to 560 ¢ 106 TJ in 2040 (see Fig. 1a) [4].

In 2011, The World Bank estimated that there were 176 vehicles
per 1000 people on average in the world. The number was 55 for
low and middle income countries, 620 for high income countries,
and 797 in the U.S. alone [6]. Especially for non-OECD countries, the
liquid fuel consumption is expected to increase (see Fig. 1b) [4]. In
order to accommodate the increasing demand from developing

countries it is crucial to develop technologies for a sustainable pro-
duction of renewable transportation fuels. Fluctuations in the crude
oil prices [4,7], which in 2016 were historically low [7], affect the
economy of emerging technologies immensely.

Today, the infrastructure of the modern society is almost solely
based on carbon based fuels due to their very high energy density
and their availability from the still large oil reserve. At the same time,
wind and solar based electricity production is reaching a mature stage
and is today cost competitive with the fossil based in some regions of
the world [8]. The major threshold for both fuel-cell and battery
driven vehicles is the necessity to build a new fuel infrastructure with
charging stations for H2 or electricity, respectively [9]. Battery driven
vehicles also struggle with a low energy density and instability of the
currently dominant lithium batteries [9]. Another obstacle lies in the
availability of wind and solar based electricity and lack of good stor-
age technologies, e.g. chemical energy storage via hydrogen is not yet
economically feasible [10]. Electricity production from photovoltaic
cells peaks during the day, whereas power consumption typically
peaks in the morning and afternoon, which results in the so-called
duck-curve [11]. Consequently, carbon based fuels currently appear
as an attractive candidate for the principal part of the transportation
energy, and biomass appears as the most promising renewable
source. Additionally, for aviation, heavy duty road transport, and
shipping industries, it is unlikely that these will be fueled by
electricity in the near future. The earth's biomass production
capacity can however not be increased to cover the total global
energy demand [12], and it is important to stress that the future
energy supply system is most likely to be based on several syn-
for
ergetic technologies, which can complement each other,
example in order to fill the gap in the duck-curve.

Biomass can be used as a raw material for the production of fuels
with low (potentially zero) carbon footprint [13(cid:1)15]. First genera-
tion biofuel processes such as bio-ethanol (from sugar cane and
corn) and bio-diesel (from vegetable oils) convert biomass into fuel
through well-established technologies [16]. However, since the
applied biomass types are edible, a political and ethical dilemma
may arise when considering that many people (e.g. 13% in
2008(cid:1)2010 [17]) in the world are starving. Additionally, the energy
efficiency per unit land is markedly lower for food grade biomass
compared to energy crops [15]. Therefore, development of second
generation biofuels is based on utilization of non-edible biomasses
such as wood, energy crops, algae, and waste material from agricul-
ture, paper production, and municipalities [18,19].

Mortensen et al. [20] reviewed the competitiveness of various
routes for biofuel generation. Based on an assessment of the fuel
price per mass of oil equivalent, it was concluded that a viable route
for renewable liquid fuel production is fast pyrolysis coupled with
catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). While fast pyrolysis is used to
increase the biomass energy density by producing a liquid product
commonly referred to as bio-oil, which can be transported more eas-
ily than solid biomass, catalytic HDO is used to enhance the fuel
properties through oxygen removal in a H2 atmosphere using a suit-
able catalyst. Another promising technology is the coupling of fast
pyrolysis and HDO in catalytic fast hydropyrolysis, where the HDO is
performed directly in the pyrolysis reactor [21]. The H2 required for
these processes could possibly be provided by electrolysis of water
powered by wind or solar energy.

This review provides an overview of the principles of biomass
pyrolysis (Section 2) followed by an extensive review of catalytic
HDO (Section 3), which leads to the discussion of coupled fast pyrol-
ysis and catalytic HDO in a continuous process such as catalytic fast
hydropyrolysis (Section 4). With respect to HDO (Section 3), the
reader is also referred to the review by Mortensen et al. [20], which
includes literature up until 2011. Compared to this former review,
Section 3 in this work expands and updates the part on catalytic
HDO. Each section (2, 3, and 4) begins with an introduction to pub-
lished reviews within pyrolysis, catalytic HDO, and catalytic fast
hydropyrolysis, respectively. The aim of this review is to compre-
hensively cover all three topics at once, in order to couple the knowl-
edge from fast pyrolysis and HDO (Sections 2 and 3) in the discussion
and evaluation of proposed processes for production of transporta-
tion fuels from biomass fast pyrolysis, catalytic HDO, and catalytic
fast hydropyrolysis (Section 4).

2. Fast pyrolysis of biomass

Fast pyrolysis of solid biomass is done by fast heating to
400(cid:1)600 °C in an inert atmosphere whereby a large fraction of the
biomass is converted to a liquid product (after condensation) with a
typical energy recovery of 45(cid:1)75% [22]. The produced oil, which is
commonly referred to as pyrolysis oil or bio-oil is a dark homoge-
neous liquid, which contains water and a wide range of oxygenates
[22]. The energy recovery of the oil can be defined as:
(cid:1)
YH 1⁄4 hoil

¢ 100%

ð1Þ

(cid:3)

¢ moil
hbiomass

Here, YH is the energy recovery, and h is the heat of combustion
(MJ/kg) of the produced oil and the feed biomass, typically defined
as the higher heating value (HHV), and moil is the mass of bio-oil
formed per kg biomass. Typically, the heating value of bio-oil is simi-
lar to the feedstock and approximately half the heating value of
crude oil [23]. In this section, the principles of fast pyrolysis and
selected reactor technologies will be discussed with emphasis on
the pyrolysis of woody biomass. More information on fast pyrolysis
of biomass can be found in the reviews by Bridgwater [23(cid:1)26],
Mohan et al. [27], Butler et al. [28], Yaman [29], and Venderbosch
and Prins [30].

Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of biomass in the
absence of oxygen, which generates gas, condensable vapors (the
bio-oil), and char. The pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, and the
residence time of the vapors and char have a significant influence
on the liquid, solid, and gas yields [30]. Fast pyrolysis operating
conditions have been optimized to obtain a maximum liquid yield
of 55(cid:1)80 wt% for wood [22,31(cid:1)35]. The main features of fast pyrol-
ysis are [23]:

- High heating rate of the biomass surface, with orders of more

than 100 °C/s.

- Short residence time of the gas and vapors, preferably below 2 s.
This minimizes the extent of secondary reactions that would
decrease the bio-oil yield and increase the gas yield. Fast cooling
of the vapors is used to collect the bio-oil and avoid secondary
reactions.

- The temperature in the reactor is carefully controlled and is in
the range of 400(cid:1)600 °C. In this temperature range high con-
version to a liquid can be achieved, while vapor cracking is
minimized.

If fast pyrolysis is performed in the presence of a catalyst, it is
called catalytic pyrolysis. This is typically performed in an inert
atmosphere at ambient pressure with a (potentially modified) crack-
ing catalyst such as HZSM-5 [36(cid:1)43], or with other materials such
as red mud [44] and alumina based catalysts [45,46]. As this review
deals with catalytic HDO and coupling of fast pyrolysis with HDO,
catalytic pyrolysis with non-HDO catalysts and upgrading of pyroly-
sis oil with zeolites without hydrogen in the gas phase is outside the
scope of this review. For an overview of the work performed within
this field, we refer to the reviews of Venderbosch [47] and Yildiz et
al. [48] for catalytic fast pyrolysis, and to the review of Rezaei et al.
[49] and Mortensen et al. [20] for upgrading of pyrolysis oil with
zeolites.

2.1. Fast pyrolysis reactor technology

In this section, we review two well-known fast pyrolysis reactor
designs; the fluid bed reactor and the ablative reactor. Descriptions
of other designs such as vacuum pyrolysis or auger pyrolysis reactors
can be found in the reviews of Bridgwater [23], Mohan et al. [27],
and Garcia-Nunez et al. [50].

2.1.1. Fluid bed reactors

In a fluid bed reactor, an inert gas is sent upwards through a par-
ticulate bed consisting of an inert heat transfer material and bio-
mass, which is continuously fed, whereby the entire bed is fluidized.
transfer are obtained
Hereby high rates of mixing and heat
[23,27,30]. Fluid beds are divided into bubbling fluid beds (BFB)
where the bed is contained in the bottom part of the reactor, and cir-
culating fluid beds (CFB), where the gas velocity is comparatively
higher and the bed material is continuously entrained out of the
reactor and returned using a cyclone [23,27,30]. For fast pyrolysis of
biomass, the BFB design shown in Fig. 2 is often used [23]. The pro-
duced char can be combusted in a separate reactor to provide the
necessary heat to the process. Alternatively, the char could poten-
tially also be exported as a soil improvement agent or used for other
purposes [51(cid:1)53], but the composition and properties of the char
should be critically addressed. Especially carcinogenic compounds
such as heavy metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are an issue.

In the BFB it is fairly easy to control the temperature and an efficient
heat transfer to the biomass is obtained by using sand as heat carrier
[23,30,54]. The residence time for the char and vapor is controlled
by the flow rate of the carrier gas. The solid particles have a higher
residence time than the vapors [27]. As shown in Fig. 2 the char is
separated by cyclones, and the bio-oil is separated from the gas by
condensation and electrostatic precipitation of the aerosol vapors
[23,27].

In the CFB, sand leaves the reactor together with the products
[23,27,30]. The sand and char particles are separated from the gas by
cyclones and sent to a combustor, before some of the gas is recycled
back to the fluid bed reactor. The heat generated through combus-
tion of char is used to heat the sand, which is then recycled back to
the pyrolysis reactor [23,27,30,55]. However, with this reactor con-
figuration solid ash can be recycled back to the pyrolysis reactor,
which can lead to undesirable ash build-up in the system, which
may decrease the liquid yield [56]. The gas velocity in the CFB reac-
tor (5(cid:1)15 m/s or higher) is larger than in the BFB reactor (1(cid:1)3 m/s),
with the choice of velocity depending on the particle size and den-
sity. The high gas velocity leads to attrition of the char particles
hence decreasing the particle size [23,27]. Since smaller particles are
more difficult to separate from the product gas stream, this may lead
to an increased char content in the bio-oil [23,27].

An important advantage of the CFB reactor is that it is suitable for
upscaling, which makes it possible to have high throughputs with
this technology compared to competing technologies [23]. Thus, the
CFB reactor is the most widely used type of fast pyrolysis reactor for
large scale plants. The CFB has been operated at commercial scale
and the technology (RTP) is sold by Envergent Technologies [57].

2.1.2. Ablative reactors

In the ablative reactor the biomass particles are pressed against a
hot surface whereby a high heating rate is obtained [27]. Biomass
melts on the surface forming an oil film, which vaporizes and gives
access to fresh biomass [23,27,28,30]. An ablative reactor design is
shown in Fig. 3. In the ablative reactor the outer part of each particle
is rapidly heated, and the generated char is then shredded from the
biomass particle. The ablative reactor is consequently limited by the
rate of heat transfer to the surface of the particle, and larger particles

high concentration of lignin has also been found to give a relatively
low bio-oil yield [74].

In the following, the effect of using different feedstocks will be
discussed. However, not all of the conducted research is performed
at conditions, which are optimal for bio-oil production. Conse-
quently some of the reported liquid yields are lower than what can
be obtained with optimized conditions.

When using wood the bio-oil yield is typically between
55(cid:1)75 wt% on dry ash free basis (daf) [22,31(cid:1)35]. This is due to the
low ash content of 0.4(cid:1)3 wt% dry basis (db), a low potassium con-
tent of 0.04(cid:1)0.4 wt% db, and a low lignin content of 10(cid:1)30 wt% daf
[22,31(cid:1)33,75(cid:1)79]. Because of the high liquid yield and a high liquid
energy recovery (»75%) [22,31(cid:1)33,75], wood is considered an opti-
mal feedstock for fast pyrolysis oil production.

Generally, the bio-oil yields from fast pyrolysis of agricultural
biomass such as wheat straw is 40(cid:1)65 wt% daf [22,31,35,80(cid:1)83]
with an energy recovery of approximately 55% [22,31,32]. The lower
yield compared to wood can be ascribed to the higher ash
(4(cid:1)10 wt% db) and particularly potassium (0.9(cid:1)1.5 wt% db) content
in straw [22,31,35,80(cid:1)84]. Rice straw gives a slightly higher bio-oil
yield (40(cid:1)70 wt% daf) than wheat straw, despite the fact that it has
a high ash content of 9(cid:1)20 wt% db [72,83,85,86]. However, the
major fraction of the ash is silicon, which has no or low catalytic
cracking activity.

Lignin can be obtained as a byproduct from paper production and
the production of second generation bio-ethanol [74,87]. Lignin is
more difficult to process than straw or wood, since lignin swells and
becomes sticky during heating. At the same time, the bio-oil yield is
lower, typically 30(cid:1)60 wt% daf, while the char yield is higher,
25(cid:1)50 wt% daf [22,62,74,87]. The energy recovery in bio-oil from lig-
nin is therefore also moderate (»45%) [22], which makes it a less
attractive feedstock for fast pyrolysis. Macroalgae have also been
considered for fast pyrolysis. However, the ash content is very high
(up to 50 wt% db) [22,88(cid:1)93], and the bio-oil yield is therefore only
around 50(cid:1)65 wt% daf [22,93,94]. Furthermore, macroalgae need to
be dried before they can be used in fast pyrolysis. Interestingly the
energy recovery for macroalgae is between 25 and 76% [22,61], as
high as for wood. The high energy recovery for macroalgae could be
due to the relatively high protein and lipid content which is easily
converted to liquid oil compared to woody biomass [95].

It is also possible to produce bio-oil from sewage sludge by fast
pyrolysis and thereby both reduce the volume of solid waste and
produce bio-oil. However, there are large variations in the ash con-
tent (25(cid:1)50 wt% db) in sewage sludge, thus the bio-oil yield varies
between 30(cid:1)60 wt% daf [61,76,96(cid:1)98]. Sewage sludge additionally
has a high moisture content and drying is needed before it can be
used [96,97].

The temperature is an important parameter in fast pyrolysis and
must be carefully controlled in order to achieve maximal bio-oil
yield [34,75,99(cid:1)101]. Generally, it is observed that increasing the
temperature increases the gas yield and decreases the char yield
[34,60,75,101,102]. The optimal temperature for bio-oil production
for fast pyrolysis is 450(cid:1)550 °C for most types of biomass, as indi-
cated in Fig. 4. Above 550 °C the bio-oil yield decreases significantly
and the gas yield increases [99], because the higher temperature
leads to cracking of the formed vapors [25,26,60].

The residence time of the pyrolysis vapors is also an important
parameter. If the residence time is too high secondary reactions such
as thermal cracking will take place, which decreases the bio-oil yield
[100,104]. The pyrolysis vapor consists of many reactive species, and
thus, a high residence time can increase the size of the molecules
due to polymerization [105]. The gas residence time should normally
be below 2 s in order to achieve a maximum liquid yield [106], and
several studies have shown a decrease in the bio-oil yield when the
residence time is increased [56,59,80,104]. The heating rate is also
an important parameter; a too low heating rate leads to a higher

Trinh et al. [22,60(cid:1)62]. Reprinted from [60] (copyright 2009) with permission from

can therefore be used [23,58]. The heat transfer, and thereby the
heating rate, increases with increasing pressure of particles onto the
reactor wall. Similarly, increasing the relative velocity between the
particles and the wall also increases the heat transfer rate [23,27].
The process is controlled by the available surface area [23] and the
capacity is therefore a linear function of the available heat transfer
area [27], which limits the capacity of this technology. Some of the
more developed ablative reactors are the rotating cone [30,59], the
auger bed reactor [28,30], and the pyrolysis centrifuge reactor [60].
One of the advantages of the ablative reactors is that they are inde-
pendent of an inert energy carrier and a gas for fluidization [30]. In
terms of commercial use, there are (to the authors’ knowledge) cur-
rently no ablative reactors operating with a feed capacity above
1 ton/h.

2.2. Influence of feedstock and operating conditions

The main constituents of biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin [19,63(cid:1)67]. The distribution between these components
varies for the different types of biomass [65]. Cellulose is a linear
polymer consisting of b-(1!4)-D-glucopyranose units [27], which is
thermally defragmented at 270(cid:1)400 °C [68(cid:1)70]. Hemicellulose con-
sists of different polymerized monosaccharides such as glucose,
mannose, galactose, xylose, arabinose, 4-O-ethylglucuronic acid, and
galacturonic acid residues [27]. The number of repeating units is sig-
nificantly smaller than for cellulose and thermal decomposition
takes place at 220(cid:1)400 °C [30,70]. Lignin is a three-dimensional,
highly branched, phenolic polymer [19,27,30], which has a broad
thermal decomposition range of 160(cid:1)900 °C [30,70].

The yield, composition, and properties of bio-oil from fast pyroly-
sis are influenced by the composition of the biomass, the residence
time in the reactor, inorganic constituents, and the temperature.
Most studies of biomass fast pyrolysis have been performed using
wood, however, other feedstocks such as straw,
lignin, sewage
sludge, and macroalgae have also been used [22,61,62,71]. A high
ash content decreases the oil yield, while increasing the char and gas
yield [30,31]. Alkali metals in the ash are generally considered to
decrease the oil yield by catalyzing cracking reactions (producing
gas) and condensation reactions (producing char). Since the pro-
duced char is rich in ash, it is catalytically active and should be
removed from the pyrolysis reactor to limit side reactions. Especially
potassium, calcium, and sodium have been reported to have a nega-
tive impact on the oil yield [30(cid:1)32,72]. Cracking increases the water
content in the oil and thereby decreases its heating value [31]. Alkali
metals have furthermore been reported to accelerate bio-oil aging
during storage [73]. Silicon and other non-alkali metals have been
reported to be inactive during the pyrolysis [30]. Biomass with a

char yield [23]. The heating rate in fast pyrolysis is more than 100 °C/
s at the biomass particle surface. In fluid bed reactors, the fluidiza-
tion velocity is also an important parameter, because it determines
the gas residence time and influences the mixing between the cold
biomass particles and the hot sand [101]. In order to achieve a high
oil yield with the fluid bed reactor, the biomass particles should
preferably be smaller than a few mm in diameter [107(cid:1)111]. A low
moisture content of the feed biomass is also preferred, because a
high moisture content limits the heat transfer and thereby increases
the char yield [112,113].

2.3. Bio-oil properties

Bio-oil is a complex mixture, consisting of hundreds of different
compounds [32,114]. It has a dark brown color and is a viscous, but
freely flowing liquid [23,30]. The water content is typically around
15(cid:1)30 wt% [23,24,115], but can be as high as 60 wt% [116]. The
water cannot be removed through conventional distillation, because
rapid polymerization occurs when bio-oil is heated resulting in the
formation of 30(cid:1)50 wt% residual solid [115]. The most important
properties of bio-oil are compared to different types of conventional
fossil oils in Table 1. It is clear that bio-oil is very different from
crude oil. Bio-oil has a high oxygen content, typically 35(cid:1)50 wt%
[22(cid:1)24,115], which significantly decreases the HHV. The resulting
less than half the HHV for
HHV for bio-oil

is 16(cid:1)21 MJ/kg;

conventional petroleum oils [22,24]. Because of the high oxygen
content bio-oil has a high polarity and is consequently immiscible
with conventional petroleum oils [23,27,30]. The density of bio-oil is
approximately 1.2 kg/L [23,24], which is significantly higher than
the density of diesel (0.82(cid:1)0.85 kg/L) [117,118]. This means that on
a mass basis (MJ/kg), the energy content in bio-oil is 37(cid:1)49% of that
of diesel, but on a volumetric basis (MJ/L), the energy content in bio-
oil is 53(cid:1)71%. The viscosity of bio-oil varies between 13 and 100 cSt
depending on the water content and the composition [24,115]. Trace
amounts of ash, alkali, chlorine, and sulfur may also be present in
bio-oil.

Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC(cid:1)MS) [32,120]
and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [114,120]
analysis of different bio-oils have revealed that the bio-oil con-
tains acids, non-aromatic aldehydes, nonaromatic ketones, fur-
ans, pyrans, sugars, benzenes, catechols, lignin derived phenols,
guaiacols, and syringols. A list of common molecules found in
bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis of wood is shown in Table 2.
Fig. 5a shows a typical carbon distribution in the compounds
present in oak bio-oil and illustrates that the organics in bio-oil are
mainly composed of a lignin-derived fraction as well as a cellulosic/
hemicellulosic fraction (C5-6), and short C2 compounds. In Fig. 5b,
the organic content is divided based on compound types.

Bio-oil derived from wood has been reported to have a high con-
centration of hydroxyacetaldehyde and levoglucosan, which are deg-
radation products from cellulose [32,132]. The cellulosic and
hemicellulosic part of biomass is responsible for the corrosive char-
acter (from acids) and instability (from light and reactive oxygen-
ates) of bio-oil, see Section 3.1. The pH of bio-oil is around 2.4(cid:1)3.2
(see Table 1) [22,24,25,115], and acid proof materials should be used
for storage [133]. Due to the high oxygen content, bio-oil contains
reactive functional groups, which make the bio-oil unstable and
polymerize when stored. This increases the molecular weight, which
in turn increases the viscosity and density of the oil. The water con-
tent also increases over time, which can lead to phase separation
[24,115,134,135].

Bio-oil contains small amounts of char (entrained from the pyrol-
ysis process), wax derived compounds and heavy molecules. The
waxy compounds tend to crystallize in the upper layer of bio-oil or
on cold surfaces [136]. The heavy compounds typically form net-
works in the bottom layer, while the water can form droplets over
time [136]. These features are part of the reason for the phase sepa-
ration that sometimes occur during storage [136]. Chlorine, sulfur,
nitrogen, and alkali metals in the bio-oil can act as poisons on cata-
lysts used for upgrading of bio-oil [23,137,138].

The phenolic content consists of aromatics with a lower O/C
content compared to the cellulose and hemicellulose derived
compounds. Additionally, these aromatics are stable and do not
readily react. In conclusion, the negative influence of aromatic
oxygenates on the fuel quality of bio-oil is less significant com-
pared to cellulose and hemicellulose fragments. It is therefore
interesting that bio-oil model compounds upgrading studies
have mainly focused on oxygen removal from phenolic species.
They may be the most difficult compounds to upgrade, but they
are also the least problematic compounds with respect to stabil-
ity upon storage and heating. This discussion is revisited and
elaborated in Section 3.

2.4. Commercial aspects of bio-oil utilization

Bio-oil can in many aspects replace crude oil as fuel in boilers and
experiments have shown that it can be used for shorter periods in
diesel engines [139(cid:1)143]. However, when using bio-oil in diesel
engines the following problems have been reported: ignition diffi-
culties, fuel injection problems, corrosion of injector needles, and
coking of combustion chamber, exhaust valve, and injection nozzles

leading to clogging [116,140(cid:1)145]. Consequently, further upgrading
of the bio-oil is necessary in order to use it as a liquid transportation
fuel. Bio-oil can also be used in gas turbines [24,116,146,147], but
corrosion of the turbine blades and deposit build-up makes it neces-
sary to modify the turbines in order to run on pure bio-oil [24,116].
It is common to use furnaces and boilers for power generation,
and bio-oil has therefore been tested as a possible fuel for this
application [24,148,149].

Even though fast pyrolysis technologies to some extent are com-
mercially available and even used in Finland for combined heat and
power generation [57,150,151], the market for bio-oil in power
plants and small boilers is currently limited. Solid biomass, such as
wood chips or pellets, is already used in power plants in Europe
with a minimum requirement for pretreatment [152], which limits
the interest in biomass pyrolysis processes that produce a fuel with
limited applicability. Bio-oil can be mixed with the produced char
and gasified to form synthesis gas, which can be converted into liq-
uid fuels [153,154]. It is also possible to co-process the bio-oil with
conventional fuels in a refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit
[155,156], but co-feeding is highly challenged in hydrotreating units
due to the high content of oxygen in bio-oil, which makes it immisci-
ble with fossil feeds and causes severe coking [157]. It should be fur-
ther noted that the alkali metals in the bio-oil can decrease the
lifetime of catalysts in both the FCC and hydrotreating processes
[48,155(cid:1)157]. It should also be mentioned that zeolites, which are
used as commercial FCC catalysts [158], typically have a high crack-
ing activity, which limits the oil yield. There are, however, some
promising results on co-feeding catalytic pyrolysis oil to FCC units at
both small [159,160] and larger scale [161,162].

3. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation

Catalytic HDO is known from hydrotreating (also called hydro-
processing) of crude oil, where it is used to remove the <1% oxygen
present in the feed [24,163]. Hydrotreating covers the removal of
sulfur (hydrodesulfurization, HDS), nitrogen (hydrodenitrogenation,
HDN), oxygen (HDO), and metals (hydrodemetallization, HDM) from
fossil crudes [163]. Since the oxygen content in bio-oil is signifi-
cantly higher than in fossil feedstocks, the requirements for catalysts
for hydrotreating of bio-oil is significantly different from those for
hydrotreating a fossil feed.

The literature on bio-oil upgrading by HDO and other techniques
has experienced a massive increase within the last decades. Saidi
et al. [164] counted the number of bio-oil related HDO papers and
found 5, 16, 73, and 131 publications for the years 2006, 2008,
2010, and 2012. Reviewing the literature published after 2012 indi-
cates a near exponential growth as seen from Fig. 6. There are 447
publications in total on “hydrodeoxygenation” in 2017 of which
189 are also within the topic "bio-oil" and 155 publications also
within the topic "model compound” .

In conclusion, bio-oil upgrading by HDO is a hot topic, which has
called many researchers to contribute to the complex task of con-
verting biomass into high quality liquid fuels. The scope of this sec-
tion is not to give an exhaustive review of the HDO literature, but
rather to provide a comprehensive overview of the most important
concepts, results, and trends.

In 2007, Elliott [166] reviewed the historical development in
hydrotreating of bio-oil produced via different pyrolysis and lique-
faction techniques. In 2014, this review was followed up by a

critical review including perspectives on industrial process integra-
tion and evaluation of techno-economic analyses [167]. Furimsky
[168] has provided a comprehensive review on catalytic HDO
chemistry in terms of reaction mechanisms and kinetics for both
petrochemical and biomass derived model oxygenates with a focus
on conventional hydrotreating catalysts. A more general review by
Furimsky [169] focuses on hydrotreating of various bio-feeds with
vegetable oil, lignocellulosic, algae, and sewage sludge origin over
different catalyst classes. A number of recent reviews focus on cata-
lytic HDO of lignocellulosic bio-oil and model oxygenates including
descriptions of the HDO chemistry over different catalytic systems
[20,121,130,170].

The majority of studies on catalytic HDO involve the conversion
of model compounds chosen to represent selected functionalities
present in bio-oil. The results from these studies aid the understand-
ing of individual reaction mechanisms for a given catalyst and set of
reaction conditions. Even though these results provide some insight
into catalytic HDO, they cannot be used to draw general conclusions
for HDO of real bio-oil due to the complexity of its composition and
impurities present. Also, the evaluation of catalytic HDO activity
should include considerations on catalyst properties such as active
phase dispersion (or particle size), surface area, and pore volume as
these features will affect the observed HDO activity.

3.1. Reactions, reactivity, and reaction mechanisms

The complex structure of biomass results in bio-oil compositions
with very high diversity as mentioned in Section 2.3 and shown in
Table 2. As a result of the complex composition, catalytic HDO of
bio-oil entails a comprehensive reaction network. An overview of
reactions that can occur during upgrading of bio-oil is shown in
Fig. 7 together with commonly applied acronyms.

Decarboxylation and decarbonylation (DCO) especially occur in
upgrading of vegetable oils due to a high content of fatty acids and
fatty acid esters [171]. HDO covers the removal of oxygen with H2
and has the deoxygenated compound and water as products. HDO
can occur as direct deoxygenation (DDO) or with saturation of dou-
ble bonds or aromatic functional groups by hydrogenation (HYD)
prior to deoxygenation. It should be noted that HYD has also been
used as an acronym for combined hydrogenation and deoxygenation
[172(cid:1)174]. Cracking reactions (CRA or HCR) are dominant in
upgrading processes with zeolites and are well-known from the FCC
of petrochemical oils [158]. Demethylation (DME), demethoxylation

(DMO), and transalkylation reactions such as methyl transfer (MT)
are acid catalyzed and are thus observed when using acidic supports
such as Al2O3 [172,173,175,176]. Coking and polymerization reac-
tions typically occur as well, and the extent depends largely on the
acidity of the catalyst support [177(cid:1)180], on the temperature [181],
and on the oxygenate functionality [166,168].

C(cid:1)(cid:1)C and C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond cleavage is the common route for upgrading
of simple oxygenates and furans, while phenols can undergo either
DDO or hydrogenation (HYD) prior to deoxygenation [121,175]. The
acid catalyzed reactions have previously been assigned the acronym
ACI
to distinguish these reactions from the HDO pathways
[172,173].

Due to the complex nature of the HDO reaction network, the HDO
reactivity can be difficult to quantify. In a simple approach, it may be
described as inversely related to the oxygen bond dissociation
energy, which follows the trend Ar(cid:1)(cid:1)OH > Ar(cid:1)(cid:1)OR > R(cid:1)(cid:1)OH > R(cid:1)(cid:1)OR’
(see Table 3) [168], with Ar representing aromatic species and R rep-
resenting aliphatic species.

More detailed reactivity scales were presented by Elliott [166]
(see Fig. 8), Yin et al. [183] (see Fig. 9), and Grange et al. [184]
(see Table 4). Figs. 8 and 9 both give a reactivity ranking, which
will depend on the catalyst identity and the thermodynamics. The
isoreactive temperature in Table 4 is the temperature required
for deoxygenation to take place, and as seen from Table 4 it is
much lower for simple oxygenates such as ketones and carbox-
ylic acids (Tiso = 203 °C and 283 °C) compared to phenolic species
(Tiso > 300 °C). The activation energy for deoxygenation follows
the same trend (see Table 4).

Phenolic species, primarily derived from lignin, are very resis-
tant to HDO owing to the strong Ar(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond and the stabilizing
nature of the aromatic ring. Hence, they have received great atten-
tion in the bio-oil upgrading literature as will be evident in the fol-
lowing sections. HDO of phenolics may (depending on the choice
of catalyst) require hydrogenation of the aromatic ring to facilitate
deoxygenation by weakening the C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond, which in turn results
in a high hydrogen demand.
it has been questioned
whether the DDO pathway is even feasible since it requires scis-
sion of a strong C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond [168,185]. Moreover, presence of other
components in the bio-oil may hamper deoxygenation of phenolic
compounds [186].

In fact,

Simple, cellulose derived oxygenates, on the other hand, are very
reactive [166,183]. Aldehydes and ketones readily undergo polymer-
ization and condensation reactions upon storage, while heating of
bio-oil above around 80 °C may cause undesired coke formation
[134,135,187]. Low temperature and high H2 pressure is typically
required to stabilize such reactive species [121,188]. Simple oxygen-
ates have received little attention in HDO studies, probably due to
their high reactivity. This is in spite of their high concentration in
bio-oil compared to aromatic species (see Fig. 5) and them being
reactive oxygenates responsible for several detrimental properties
of bio-oil (e.g. instability and acidity, and coking of catalysts and
reactor plugging). Stabilization and upgrading of simple oxygenates
has instead been targeted through other approaches such as liquid
phase ketonization and aldol condensation [189(cid:1)191]. Cellulosic
sugar (polyol) fragments such as levoglucosan and cellobiosan occur
as intermediates during pyrolysis [105,122] and are among the most
reactive bio-oil species owing to the high polymerization and coking
tendency, which directly affects catalyst lifetime and operation
stability [188].

Fig. 10 shows the enthalpy of reaction and equilibrium constant
for the HDO and DCO reactions of a range of the most abundant bio-
oil compounds (see Table 2). The HDO reactions (Fig. 10a, R1-R4) are
highly exothermic, and full conversion of an oxygenate-rich feed is
associated with a risk of thermal runaway; especially in batch and
fixed bed reactor experiments. DCO reactions (Fig. 10a, R5 and R6)
are less troublesome in terms of heat development and may even be

endothermic as is the case for 2-butenal decarbonylation. All reac-
tions in Fig. 10 (except for R1, see below) are spontaneous in the
temperature range of 100(cid:1)700 °C.

The selectivity towards HYD or DDO products does not only
depend on the choice of catalyst but to a high extent also on the
reaction thermodynamics. The DDO route for phenol HDO (Fig. 10,
R2) becomes more favorable than the HYD route (Fig. 10, R1) at tem-
peratures above »275 °C. At »450 °C, the equilibrium constant for
R1 is < 1; the Gibbs free energy is >0 kJ/mol, and hydrogenation of
the aromatic ring is unfavorable. Similar results were obtained by
Edelman et al. [192].

With the thermodynamics in mind, the consumption of hydrogen
can be (partly) controlled through the choice of operating tempera-
ture and H2 pressure. A thermodynamic calculation has shown that
the conversion of phenol into cyclohexane (Fig. 10, R1) in H2 at
25 bar is »100% at 200(cid:1)300 °C (using the software package HSC
Chemistry v.9.4.1). At > 300 °C, the conversion drops reaching 90%
at 475 °C, 60% at 590 °C, and 40% at 650 °C. A high temperature
(> 300 °C) and low H2 pressure (e.g. atmospheric) will favor the
DDO path and a low hydrogen consumption. Note that the DDO
path for phenolic species will require a high temperature to acti-
vate the strong arylic C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond.

Dwiatmoko et al. [193] studied the effect of various carbohy-
drate derived compounds (sugars, carboxylic acids, furans, furfu-
rals, and aldehydes) on the HDO of guaiacol over ruthenium
catalysts in a batch reactor, which was pressurized with 40 bar
H2 and then heated to a reaction temperature of 270(cid:1)300 °C.
Among the tested compounds, only furfural and 5-hydroxyme-
thylfurfural affected the guaiacol conversion. They observed that
the conversion of guaiacol dropped from 98% to 28% when the
molar furfural/guaiacol ratio was increased from 0.47 to 0.96
while the yield of fully deoxygenated products decreased from
50 to 14% over a Ru/C catalyst at 270 °C. Further increasing the
furfural/guaiacol ratio led to even lower conversion and yields.
Full conversion of furfural was obtained in all cases with nearly
unchanged product selectivity. The inhibition of guaiacol conver-
sion by furfural was explained by competitive adsorption, which
was supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of
the adsorption energy. A similar observation was made by Ryy-
min et al. [194] for a Ni-MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst, where methyl hep-
tanoate was reported to suppress phenol conversion without the
opposite being observed.

As reviewed by Furimsky [168], numerous mechanistic studies
exist for the HDO of bio-oil model compounds and mainly for the
conversion of phenolic species. Bui et al. [182] presented a general
reaction scheme for guaiacol HDO over transition metal sulfides
based on experiments with MoS2 and Co-MoS2 (bulk and Al2O3-sup-
ported) performed in a fixed bed reactor at 300 °C and 40 bar H2 (see
Fig. 11). The Al2O3 support was associated with DME and MT reac-
tions, while Co promotion was associated with DDO reactions. A
more detailed reaction network was presented by Runnebaum et al.
[175] based on a comprehensive experimental study on the conver-
sion of guaiacol, anisole, cyclohexanone and 4-methylanisole in a
fixed bed reactor over a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at 300 °C and 1.4 bar (see
Fig. 12).

As indicated by Figs. 11 and 12, the reaction mechanism for HDO
of even a single bio-oil model compound is rather complex. The spe-
cific reaction mechanism will depend on the type of catalyst (includ-
ing active phase particle size, promoters, and support), the operating
conditions, and the presence of inhibitors or poisons. Therefore, a
complete mechanistic and kinetic understanding of the HDO of real
bio-oil will not be obtained in the near future. However, such a
detailed understanding may not be necessary in order to develop an
industrial scale process. This is the case for conventional hydrotreat-
ing, where global, lumped kinetic models are typically applied [163].

degree of deoxygenation will result in two liquid phases, a low
polarity upgraded oil phase and an aqueous phase. Three liquid

phases may form if distinct organic phases with higher and lower
density than water are formed. This was reported in the case of high
degrees of deoxygenation [188,196]. Complete deoxygenation
according to generalized equations, similar to Eq. (2), have been
associated with an oil yield of 56(cid:1)58 wt% [197]. However, this
remains a theoretical number due to the complex bio-oil composi-
tion and variety of reactions taking place (see Fig. 7). A more realistic
reaction was proposed by Venderbosch [188] for a specific experi-
ment (gas phase not included):

CH1:47O0:56 þ 0:386H2 ! 0:742CH1:47O0:11 ðoil fractionÞ

þ 0:192CH3:02O1:09 ðwater fractionÞ þ 0:285 H2O

ð3Þ

The product consisted of two phases and the oxygen content in
terms of O/C ratio was decreased from 0.56 (feed oil) to 0.11 (prod-
uct oil fraction). Similarly, the oxygen content in the resulting water
fraction was increased compared to that in the feed oil (from 0.56 to
1.09) [188]. Cracking and DCO reactions lead to the formation of
CH4, CO, CO2, and light (C2(cid:1)(cid:1)C4) hydrocarbons [188,198], which can-
not be retrieved in the condensed oil. Depending on the catalyst,
there could also be C1 interconversion reactions such as steam
reforming/methanation and water gas shift.

The efficiency of bio-oil upgrading processes can be evaluated
(and compared) based on the bio-oil yield (Yoil) and degree of deox-
ygenation (DOD):

with m being the mass of feed and produced oil, and O being the con-
tent of oxygen in the produced oil and feed, respectively. Specifically
for catalytic fast pyrolysis (also covering catalytic fast hydropyroly-
sis), Venderbosch [47] proposed to evaluate the degree of deoxygen-
ation as the actual oxygen reduction, ξO, by comparing the oxygen
content of the produced oil to that of the “thermal oil” produced by
thermal deoxygenation in the corresponding uncatalyzed process:

ð6Þ

Venderbosch [47] additionally pointed out the importance of
considering the carbon recovery in the produced oil. The carbon
recovery is affected by DCO reactions, cracking, and coking. The
energy recovery of the upgraded oil compared to the feed is also a
very important parameter, which is often overlooked (see Eq. (1)).
Other parameters such as the resulting O/C and H/C ratios provide
valuable information on the oil quality. Full deoxygenation
(DOD = 100%) is not necessarily the ultimate goal in bio-oil upgrad-
ing. Methanol, ethanol, and dimethyl ether have high oxygen con-
tents (35 and 50 wt%, respectively) but are regarded as fuels of high
value. Additionally, there is an inherent trade-off between the
degree of deoxygenation and oil yield, in part due to the removal of
oxygen. This can be seen from the representative example on yields
of oil, water, and gas at varying degrees of deoxygenation from bio-
oil HDO shown in Fig. 13, which also shows how the energy content
of the oil (HHV) increases as a function of increasing deoxygenation.
The exact composition of the produced gas and oil was not stated
by Samolada et al. [198]. The gas phase, which was produced at
yields of <20%, was reported to consist of CO, CO2 and hydrocarbons,
and for the oil, only the weight based C/H ratio and the oxygen con-
tent was stated. The HHV in Fig. 13 was calculated assuming that the

content of C, H, and O in the upgraded oil sum to 100 wt%, and by
using the correlation fitted to liquid hydrocarbons and oxygenates
by Lloyd and Davenport [199], neglecting contributions from N and
S:

HHV 1⁄4 0:3578 ¢ wt% C þ 1:1357 ¢ wt% H(cid:1)0:0845 ¢ wt% O

ð

ÞMJ=kg ð7Þ

As the degree of deoxygenation was increased from below 80% to
100%, the HHV was improved from 40 to 46 MJ/kg, the molar H/C
ratio was increased from 1.4 to 1.8, and the molar O/C ratio was
decreased from 0.1 to zero. The product properties could thus be
tuned to match those of fossil fuels by increasing the HDO severity.

As a minimum requirement, deoxygenation should be performed
to a degree, which stabilizes the oil. This is not so much a matter of
oxygen content as it is of oxygenate identity. For a typical bio-oil
with 15(cid:1)20 wt% oxygen on dry basis, removal of the more reactive
oxygenates corresponds to a degree of deoxygenation of 30(cid:1)50%
(see Table 5). Further deoxygenation and incorporation of hydrogen

could be targeted towards increasing the heating value (see Fig. 13b)
sufficiently to allow for using the produced oil directly as a fuel
(alternatively as blend in), as a co-feed in petrochemical hydrotreat-
ing, or as a means of storing hydrogen in the oil.

An overview of different bio-oil upgrading studies is given in
Table 6. More comprehensive reviews of HDO of both bio-oil
and model compound studies are available in the literature
[20,130,168,169].

As seen from Table 6, several different catalytic systems are
active in upgrading of bio-oil with the oil yield and properties
depending on the catalyst system and applied operating conditions.
Most of the studies in Table 6 were performed at pressures above
100 bar, and at moderate temperatures above 250 °C. There is a
general trade-off between yield and degree of deoxygenation for
the obtained oil as discussed previously. Cheng et al. [204] used
non-conventional Fe2O3/SiO2, Co3O4/SiO2, and Fe2O3(cid:1)(cid:1)Co3O4/SiO2
catalysts for the HDO of pine bio-oil in a batch reactor operated at

300 °C. They achieved both a lower oil yield and DOD than in the
remaining studies listed in Table 6, showing a limited potential for
these catalyst systems. Most studies were made using batch reac-
tors, which are not suited to study catalyst stability and long term
product quality, and even for the continuous experiments the run
time was much shorter than needed industrially. In fact, several
experiments were terminated due to coking and reactor plugging
[200,206,207]. In most of the studies, where reactor plugging was
not observed, carbon deposition on the catalyst was mentioned as
a main source of deactivation [45,120,196,201,202,204,205,207].
Sheu et al. [201] were not able to conduct an attempted experiment
for HDO of pine bio-oil with a sulfided NiW/Al2O3 catalyst due to
rapid reactor plugging. Wang et al. [202] reported 21.4 wt% carbon
deposited on a spent Ni-MoS2/Al2O3 used for pine bio-oil HDO; it
was however run for more than 200 h at varying operating condi-
tions (280(cid:1)350 °C and 34(cid:1)97 bar H2). During operation at 100 bar
and 350 °C, Mante et al. [45] experienced reactor plugging and
uncontrolled temperature increases in the conversion of a loblolly
pine oil over a commercial Ni-MoS2 catalyst operated in a fixed bed
reactor setup. By increasing the operating pressure and decreasing
the temperature, they were able to run for 365 h. They did, how-
ever, experience continuous deactivation, which resulted in a sig-
nificant decrease in the DOD. At constant conditions of 138 bar and
290 °C, the DOD had decreased from 97% to 45% during 325 h on
stream. They reported carbon deposition, loss of sulfur from the
catalyst active phase, and deactivation by water exposure as poten-
tial causes.

Mortensen [203] reported rapid catalyst deactivation over a com-
mercial Ni-MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst at 300 °C and 100 bar (see Fig. 14).
Initially, 100% deoxygenation was obtained with the produced oil
being clear and colorless with an H/C ratio of 2.1, similar to crude oil.

This initial product primarily consisted of naphthenes and linear/
branched hydrocarbons. However, rapid catalyst deactivation was
observed, and after 11 h the degree of deoxygenation was down to
69%, the H/C ratio had decreased to 1.9, and the produced oil looked
more similar to the feed.

Mante et al. [45] were able to obtain both a high oil yield of
64(cid:1)82% and a high DOD of 60(cid:1)94% by hydrotreating a loblolly pine
oil. Note that they used a bio-oil obtained from catalytic fast pyroly-
sis rather than fast pyrolysis. Catalytic fast pyrolysis typically gives a
low oil yield, due to the higher degree of coke formation, decarbox-
ylation, and cracking to light gasses. This was addressed by Vender-
bosch [47], who compared the results from various catalytic and
non-catalytic pyrolysis studies and showed, that the carbon yield in
the produced oil was in the range of 5(cid:1)25% for catalytic fast pyroly-
sis and above 50% for fast pyrolysis. Catalytic fast pyrolysis can addi-
tionally be used to remove the most reactive species and produce a
more stable bio-oil, which is easier to upgrade by HDO. This makes it
difficult to compare HDO results on bio-oils from fast pyrolysis and
catalytic fast pyrolysis. Mante et al. [208] have reported a carbon
yield of 10% from their catalytic pyrolysis process. In this work, 18%
carbon was lost to an aqueous phase, 50% was lost to char (8% as
solid char and 42% as CO and CO2 from char combustion), 7% was
lost to pyrolysis gasses, and 15% was unaccounted for. In contrast to
the work of Mante et al. [45,208], information on the pyrolysis oil
yield, whether being from a catalytic process or not, is often not
reported in upgrading studies, possible because this information has
not been available when acquiring the bio-oil from external suppli-
ers. It is our opinion that the oil yield, the energy content, and the
degree of deoxygenation obtained in bio-oil upgrading studies
should also be presented and discussed on the basis of the feed bio-
mass, and we encourage researchers to do so to in future work. This
will allow for better comparison of the process efficiency and
thereby also the industrial potential between different studies.

3.3. Catalysts

As mentioned above and summarized in Table 6 several catalytic
systems have been applied for the HDO of bio-oil. This section
reviews the most widely applied catalysts for HDO, namely sulfides,
oxides, reduced transition metals, and phosphides. A brief descrip-
tion of other catalysts is also given.

3.3.1. Sulfides

As biomass and bio-oils contain sulfur, it is important to con-
sider a sulfur tolerant catalyst for HDO, and the MoS2 based sys-
tems are thus a good choice. Co- and Ni-MoS2 catalysts (also

referred to as Co-/NiMoS or sulfided Co-/NiMo catalysts) have
received significant attention in upgrading of bio-oil by HDO
[171,178,182,194,196,200(cid:1)202,209(cid:1)223] based on their well-
known activity in conventional hydrotreating [163]. Studies also
exist on noble metal sulfides such as ReS2 [224(cid:1)226] and RuS2

[227], but their much higher price most likely would prohibit com-
mercial use if the current stability issues are not solved.

Ni and Co are used as promoters as they significantly enhance the
catalytic activity and stability compared to unpromoted MoS2. Sev-
eral theories have been proposed for the role of promotion as

reviewed by Topsøe et al. [163]. It is now widely accepted that the
role of promotion is the formation of highly active CoMoS and NiMoS
phases, in which Ni or Co substitutes Mo at the edges of MoS2 slabs
[163,228,229]. For Co-MoS2, it has been shown that Co has a prefer-
ence for promoting the S-edge of the hexagonal Co-MoS2 structure,
whereas both a hexagonal and a less systematic distorted hexagonal
structure has been reported for Ni-MoS2 [228(cid:1)230]. The slabs are
stacked with the S-edge in alternating direction as shown in Fig. 15.
The size and shape of the individual particles (composed of mono-
and multilayer polygonal slabs) is determined by a complex inter-
play between catalyst composition (e.g. identity of promoter), and
sulfidation conditions [229,231(cid:1)234].

The active sites for C(cid:1)(cid:1)O (in HDO) and C(cid:1)(cid:1)S (in HDS) scission is
widely accepted to be coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) of sul-
fur at the promoted (or unpromoted) MoS2 edge [194,235(cid:1)237].
CUS can be present either as sulfur vacancies or as unsaturated sites
at the sulfur terminated edge, where more sulfur (or oxygen from
oxygenates) can adsorb, and this adsorption of a heteroatom may be
correlated with a restructuring of the S atoms at the surface.

Romero et al. [172] studied HDO of 2-ethyl phenol over MoS2
based catalysts and proposed the reaction mechanism shown in
Fig. 16. The target oxygen atom chemisorbs to a sulfur vacancy,
which is created at a MoS2 slab edge by reduction with H2. SH
groups generated from feed H2 are present at the MoS2 edges
[236,237]. They enable proton donation from S to the attached mol-
ecule, which forms a carbocation that can undergo direct C(cid:1)(cid:1)O
bond cleavage to give the deoxygenated compound [216,236(cid:1)238].
The active site is regenerated when the deoxygenated product and
water are desorbed. Another mechanism was proposed for HDO of
aromatic oxygenates, with initial saturation of the aromatic ring
[172]. In this mechanism, two adjacent vacancies are needed in
order to facilitate adsorption through a sterically more constrained

flat adsorption mode, which facilitates ring hydrogenation (see Fig.
17). As opposed to the mechanism proposed by Romero et al. [172],
a DFT study from Moses et al. [235] on HDS of thiophene showed
that C-S scission could take place on CUS on a CoMoS edge without
formation of sulfur vacancies.

Based on DFT and experimental studies with thiophene, Laurit-
sen et al. [230,239,240] found that fully sulfided brim sites at edges
of both NiMoS and CoMoS structures exhibit catalytic activity for
adsorption and hydrogenation of thiophene. These so-called brim
sites have been visualized at atomic resolution as bright brims
along the MoS2 edges using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
(see Fig. 18). They are located at the edge of the top basal plane of
a multi-slab particle and exhibit metallic character due to their
electronic properties The mechanisms of HDO and HDS therefore
seem to be governed by an interaction of two different active sites
controlling the degree of hydrogenation (over brim sites) and
desulfurization/deoxygenation (via CUS) [241]. Furthermore, it has
been proposed that different types of active sites come into play in
the HDO of different oxygenate functional groups [215]. The iden-
tity and nature of active sites as well as particle morphology and
the exact location of promoter atoms in Co- and Ni-MoS2 catalysts
is still debated, which can partly be traced back to the highly
dynamic nature of these catalyst systems.

There is some dissimilarity between HDO and HDS. One example
is the comparison between sulfur and oxygen analogues such as
thiophene and furan as they interact differently with sulfur vacan-
cies due to steric constraints [242].

It is necessary to co-feed H2S in order to the enhance activity
[209,213,243] and avoid oxidation by keeping the sulfide catalyst
systems in the active sulfided form during HDO [168,203,213,242].
Gutierrez et al. [219] proposed that H2S co-fed in the HDO of a broad
variety of model compounds is responsible for creating and retaining

nucleophilic SH-groups at the sulfided catalyst surface and that
these groups can activate oxygenates at the catalyst surface. How-
ever, H2S can also be a reaction inhibitor [214(cid:1)216], but the inhibit-
ing effect depends on the oxygenate functionality and reaction
mechanism [216,217].

A concern that has been raised is that the use of sulfide catalysts
for HDO results in incorporation of sulfur into the product, which
contradicts the increasingly strict legislation on sulfur in fuels
[117,118,244] and contaminates the otherwise sulfur scant bio-oil. It
has been shown that sulfur from the catalyst surface - regardless of
whether H2S is fed to the system - can be integrated into the deoxy-
genated compounds and thereby end up in the product oil
[216,217,245,246]. However, sulfide catalysts are used industrially
in HDS to remove sulfur from oil down to a few parts per million
(ppm) [163]. Mortensen et al. [137] investigated the HDO of phenol
in 1-octanol (50 g/L) over a Ni-MoS2/ZrO2 catalyst in a fixed bed

reactor at 280 °C and 100 bar and found that sulfur incorporation
into the product could be avoided, as long as the conversion was
kept high ((cid:2) 90%). This was obtained by keeping the residence time
high at a low weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) below 0.5 h¡1.

3.3.1.1. Role of promotion. MoS2 is typically promoted with Co or Ni,
which weakens the surface metal-sulfur bond energy [247,248] and
facilitates CUS formation. Co or Ni promotion is used to enhance the
overall catalyst performance; both in terms of providing better
hydrogenation activity [209,220,230,239,240] and in terms of a bet-
ter stability towards deactivation [209,213,242].

The activity and selectivity of Ni-MoS2/Al2O3 and Co-MoS2/Al2O3
in HDO are comparable according to a study of Laurent and Delmon
[215], who investigated the conversion of 4-methylacetophenone,
diethyldecanedioate and guaiacol in a batch reactor at 260(cid:1)300 °C
and 10 bar H2. However, promotion with Ni caused a higher decar-
boxylation activity as opposed to Co [215]. For phenolic species, it is
commonly accepted that Co promotes DDO routes while Ni pro-
motes HYD routes [182,216,217,219,220,246,249,250]. In line with
this observation, Co-MoS2/Al2O3 seems to have a higher activity for
HDO of aromatic species compared to Ni-MoS2/Al2O3, while the
opposite is the case for aliphatic species [216,217,243,246]. The
choice of Co or Ni promotion could therefore take into consideration
the feed composition (aromatic/aliphatic), but also whether the
reaction gas contains CO, which has been reported to inhibit Co-
MoS2, but not Ni-MoS2 [220]. However, the choice of temperature

affects this conclusion, as thermodynamics determine whether aro-
matic ring hydrogenation is favorable or not (see Fig. 10).

Bouvier et al. [220] studied the HDO of 2-ethylphenol over Al2O3
supported MoS2, Ni-MoS2, and Co-MoS2 in a fixed bed reactor at
340 °C and 70 bar ((cid:3) 60 bar H2) with varying H2S concentration in
the feed (0.1(cid:1)0.5 bar corresponding to »1430(cid:1)7145 ppm). Their
results are shown in Fig. 19. The HYD and ACI activity for all three
catalysts increased with increasing H2S concentration. At the same
time the DDO pathway, which primarily occurred with Co promo-
tion, was strongly inhibited by H2S. It was proposed that the inhibit-
ing effect observed for Co-MoS2 was caused by CUS saturation
inhibiting oxygenate adsorption. On the contrary, Laurent and Del-
mon [215] did not report any significant influence of H2S on the
HDO of guaiacol. For aliphatic oxygenates such as ethylene glycol
[209], 1-octanol [203], diethyldecanedioate [215], methyl hepta-
noate [217], and heptanoic acid [217], H2S has been reported to have
a promoting effect on the conversion over Ni-MoS2 and Co-MoS2 cat-
alysts, even at very high concentrations of up to 2.4% [217].

The role of Ni promotion in unsupported MoS2 was investigated
by Ruinart de Brimont et al. [171] who found that the selectivity
towards DCO of ethyl heptanoate at 250 °C and 15 bar (14.4 bar H2)
increased with increasing degree of Ni promotion, while HDO selec-
tivity followed the opposite trend. The DCO selectivity was reported
to follow the trend:

Ni3S2 > Ni (cid:1) MoS2 0:43

ð

Þ(cid:4) > Ni (cid:1) MoS2 0:2ð

Þ(cid:4) > Ni (cid:1) MoS2 0:1ð

Þ(cid:4)

> MoS2

(cid:4)

Ni=Mo molar ratio

ð8Þ

In the same study, the HDO reaction rates of heptanal had the
following trend with DCO reaction rates being insignificant for all
catalysts:

Ni (cid:1) MoS2 0:43

ð
> Ni3S2 (cid:3) MoS2 (cid:4)

Þ(cid:4) >> Ni (cid:1) MoS2 0:2ð

Ni=Mo molar ratio

Þ(cid:4) > Ni (cid:1) MoS2 0:1ð

Þ(cid:4)

ð9Þ

The reactivity was found to be more complex for heptanoic acid
and ethyl heptanoate, due to competition between HDO and DCO
reactions. Dupont et al. [251] used DFT calculations to study the
interaction and HDO pathways of methyl propionate, propionic acid,
propanal, and propanol with MoS2 and Ni-MoS2. They found that
promotion with Ni facilitated a bidentate adsorption of propanal,
which lowered the activation energy for the hydrogenation of propa-
nal into propanol. The reaction of propanol to propane was proposed
to occur via the formation of an intermediate thiol at the catalyst
surface. The rate limiting step in propanal HDO to propane was the
C(cid:1)(cid:1)O cleavage in propanol, for which the activation energy was
found to be lower over Ni-MoS2 compared to MoS2.

Based on DFT calculations, Badawi et al. [213,242] found that a
H2S/H2O partial pressure ratio > 0.025 is necessary to avoid S-O
exchanges at the S-edge of MoS2, which is similar to our recent
results [209]. Badawi et al. [213] reported promotion by Co to
enhance stability towards water with no S-O exchange at 100% Co
promotion at the S-edge in the partial pressure range of H2S/H2O of
10¡5(cid:1)102 at 350 °C. This stabilizing effect was supported by trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) studies showing that exposure

of MoS2 to water led to a decrease in slab length and stacking height,
which was explained by S-O exchange. Exposure of Co-MoS2 to
water resulted in insignificant crystallite changes. The conversion of
2-ethylphenol was studied by Badawi et al. [213] over Co-MoS2/
Al2O3 and MoS2/Al2O3 in a fixed bed reactor at 340 °C and 70 bar
with a H2S/H2O ratio of 0.04(cid:1)0.12. Deactivation of both catalysts
with decreasing H2S/H2O ratio by addition of water was seen, but for
the Co promoted sample, the deactivation was mainly reversible, as
(cid:2)90% of the initial activity could be recovered by returning to the
initial water free reaction conditions. Badawi et al. [214] also used
DFT calculations to assess the Gibbs free energy of adsorption of
known inhibitors at 350 °C for a 50% promoted Co-MoS2 edge, which
the inhibition strength followed a trend of
indicated that
CO > H2O (cid:3) H2S. We recently performed an in-situ quick extended
X-ray absorption fine structure (Q-EXAFS) study [209], in which pro-
moted and un-promoted MoS2/MgAl2O4 catalysts were exposed to
varying ratios of H2S/H2O in hydrogen at 400(cid:1)450 °C. There was
hardly any bulk transformation of the Mo sulfide phase to Mo oxide,
and only negligible changes in the active phase were observed. More
surface sensitive techniques should be used in future.

Bui et al. [182] investigated the role of Co promotion in bulk and
Al2O3 supported MoS2 for the HDO of guaiacol in a fixed bed reactor
operated at 40 bar H2 and 300 °C. They found that promotion with
Co enhanced overall reaction rates and the selectivity towards DDO
of intermediate phenol into benzene. DME reactions were observed
for unpromoted MoS2 while Co-MoS2 also exhibited DMO activity.

3.3.2. Oxides

Oxides of Mo, Ni, W, V, and other metals have HDO activity
[179,252(cid:1)259]. It has been proposed that the HDO reaction mecha-
nism for reducible oxide catalysts follows a reverse Mars-van Kreve-
len mechanism [252,253] (see Fig. 20), similar to the mechanism for
sulfides proposed by Romero et al. [172] (see Fig. 16). This implies
that low H2 pressures are necessary to avoid reduction of the active
phase into inactive species [252,254,255]. Low H2 pressures are
favored from an economical perspective but may pose difficulties
from an upgrading perspective, where higher H2 pressures can miti-
gate catalyst deactivation by coking. In this mechanism (see Fig. 20),
an O-vacancy (acting as a Lewis acid site) is created by elimination
of water (reduction with hydrogen) and facilitates adsorption of an
oxygenate at the vacancy. The C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond in the oxygenate is cleaved

through electron donation from Mo, the deoxygenated product is
desorbed and the active site is regenerated by reaction with H2.

No hydrogenation activity, enabling saturation of double bonds,
has been detected for MoO3 [252,256]. A revised HDO mechanism
has been presented for supported MoO3 suggesting that the support
enables dispersion of MoOx clusters with ZrO2 and TiO2 being capa-
ble of efficiently stabilizing Mo in the redox active intermediate
Mo+3 and Mo+5 states [256].

The activity of oxides in HDO relies on the presence and strength
of acid sites. The Lewis acidity affects the initial chemisorption step,
where the oxygen lone pair of the target oxygenate is chemisorbed
at a vacancy. Brønsted acidity influences hydrogen availability at the
catalyst surface in terms of the presence of hydroxyl groups. Auroux
and Gervasini [260] have reported the Lewis acidity, based on NH3
adsorption, of a broad range of oxides to follow the trends:

Concentration of sites : Cr2O3 >> MoO3 > ZrO2

(cid:3) WO3 > Nb2O5 > TiO2 > Al2O3 > V2O5

Strength of sites : Cr2O3 >> ZrO2

(cid:3) WO3 > Nb2O5 > TiO2 > Al2O3 > MoO3 (cid:3) V2O5

ð10Þ

ð11Þ

The contribution from Brønsted acid sites was assumed negligi-
ble. ZrO2, TiO2, and Al2O3 are amphoteric and have been reported to
have basic character as well [260]. Li and Dixon [261] reported
another relative Lewis acid strength scale based on DFT calculations:
WO3 > MoO3 > Cr2O3

ð12Þ

The Brønsted acid strength in terms of relative hydroxyl acidity

was investigated by Busca et al. [262], who found:

WO3 > MoO3 > V2O5 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > TiO2 > ZrO2

ð13Þ

Furthermore, the metal-oxygen bond strength should be weak
enough to facilitate vacancy formation but strong enough to enable
oxygenate chemisorption and C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond breaking. The catalytic
HDO activity of MoO3 has been ascribed to the formation of oxycar-
bide and oxycarbohydride phases (MoOxCyHz) [254,255] as well as
the formation of hydrogen molybdenum bronzes (HxMoO3, x = 0(cid:1)2)
[253].

Prasomsri et al. [252] have reported HDO activity of various
oxides tested for acetone conversion in a fixed bed reactor at 400 °C

Fig. 20. Proposed reverse Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for HDO of alkyl substituted phenol over MoO3 (R denotes alkyl group). Drawn on the basis of [252,256].

and < 1 bar H2. They reported the acetone consumption rate to fol-
low the trend MoO3 > V2O5 > Fe2O3 > CuO (cid:3) WO3 with a selectivity
towards deoxygenated hydrocarbon (mainly propene (cid:1) due to the
insignificant hydrogenation activity) above 88% for all oxides. Reacti-
vation of spent MoO3 was possible through calcination in O2 at 400 °
C [255,256]. Whiffen and Smith [254] compared the HDO of 4-meth-
ylphenol in a batch autoclave at 41(cid:1)48 bar and 325(cid:1)375 °C using
MoO3, MoO2, MoS2, and MoP. They reported the turn over frequency
(TOF) to decrease in the order MoP > MoS2 > MoO2 > MoO3. MoO3
was reduced to MoO2 during the reaction and based on the findings
of Prasomsri et al. [252,255,256] it can be concluded that the partial
pressure of H2 of 41(cid:1)48 bar was too high to retain the MoO3 in the
active phase.

The activity of partially reduced W and Ni-W oxides supported on
active carbon was investigated by Echeandia et al. [179] in a fixed
bed reactor operated at 150(cid:1)300 °C and 15 bar. All catalysts were
proven active for HDO of phenol with the Ni-W oxide catalysts
showing a significantly higher conversion compared to the W oxides.
It was shown that W was fully reduced after 6 hours on stream,
whereas partial reduction of Ni was achieved.

As described above, the working principle behind oxide and sul-
fide catalysts is a vacancy or CUS based mechanism, which means
that inhibition is possible if continuous regeneration of the active
site is not ensured. Water formed during HDO can oxidize the active
edge of sulfides [168,203,213,242] and inhibit further reaction (see
Section 3.3.1). The H2 required for HDO can over-reduce and thereby
deactivate oxide catalysts, and sulfur is a potential poison due to its
strong adsorption [263,264]. As a result, the active phase of both
oxide and sulfide catalysts could change during operation, and cata-
lyst preparation and reaction conditions should be chosen to push
the active phase towards the desired composition.

3.3.3. Reduced transition metals

Reduced transition metal catalysts such as Ni, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh
are active in HYD and HDO reactions [120,185,188,196,201,206,
265(cid:1)267]. The reaction rate increases with increasing H2 pressure
(as opposed to oxides, see Section 3.3.2) and these catalysts do not
require a feed of H2S to remain active (as opposed to sulfides, see
Section 3.3.1). As a down-side, most reduced transition metals are
highly sensitive to sulfur poisoning, which means that sulfur in bio-
oil must be removed upstream of catalytic HDO [137]. This would
however require either a sulfur selective adsorbent or hydrotreating
over Ni/Co-MoS2 catalysts which, as discussed above, are also HDO
catalysts.

Mortensen et al. [20] proposed that HDO over transition metals
relies on a bifunctionality combining the ability of oxygenate
adsorption (referred to as oxygenate activation) with hydrogenation
activity. It was proposed that oxygenate adsorption takes place at
the metal-support interface, while hydrogen donation is facilitated
by the reduced transition metal particles [20].

A DDO reaction mechanism, in which phenol is converted into
benzene by direct C(cid:1)(cid:1)O scission, is challenged by a high bond
dissociation energy (see Table 3), as shown by DFT calculations
for HDO of phenol over Rh [268]. Instead two other mechanisms
have been proposed for the DDO mechanism, in which the C(cid:1)(cid:1)O
bond is weakened prior to scission (see Fig. 21). Instead of a
direct C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond cleavage (mechanism A in Fig. 21), it has been
proposed that an initial hydrogenation step at the ortho position
weakens the C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond and that subsequent acid-catalyzed
dehydration then leads to the desired DDO product (mechanism
B in Fig. 21) [269,270]. This mechanism would require a bifunc-
tional catalyst comprising both hydrogenation activity and acid
sites.

cleavage. Mechanism B) Based on initial hydrogenation followed by dehydrogenation. Mechanism C) Based on initial tautomerization followed by hydrogenation and dehydration.

Resasco et al. [185,271(cid:1)274] have recently presented a mecha-
nism (mechanism C in Fig. 21), which is initialized by a tautomeriza-
tion step, i.e. the interconversion between the enol and keto form of
phenol. This proposed tautomerization step was recently supported
by Griffin et al. [275] who compared the conversion of m-cresol over
Pt supported on C and TiO2. Resasco et al. [185,271(cid:1)274] have
reported that the mechanism depends on the support acidity and
oxophilicity. While acid sites catalyze dehydration, oxophilic sites
have been proposed to facilitate interaction with the carbonyl
(C = O) group present in the tautomer keto form of phenol. This
interaction promotes hydrogenation of the C = O bond on metal par-
ticles at the metal-support interface. Nelson et al. [174] have
recently presented a thorough experimental and theoretical study of
the conversion of phenol over Ru/TiO2, which partly supports the
work of Resasco et al. [185,271(cid:1)274]. Using isotopic labelling (as
indicated in Fig. 21), they confirmed the presence of phenol tauto-
merization. They were however not able to confirm the subsequent
hydrogenation/dehydration steps as proposed by Resasco et al. (see
mechanism C in Fig. 21). Instead they proposed that the amphoteric
character of the TiO2 support plays a crucial role in activating H2O as
a co-catalyst with the ability to donate and accept electrons and to
lower the C(cid:1)(cid:1)O scission barrier by donating a proton to the abstrac-
tion of the phenolic OH group [174].

As it can be inferred, there is a consensus that the mechanism of
HDO over reduced transition metals depends on a bifunctionality
based on the interplay between the support and active material. The
reaction mechanism is however still under debate. To some extent
this may be ascribed to the complexity introduced by the bifunction-
ality, namely the dependence of choice of catalyst active phase and
support. Also, as previously pointed out, the thermodynamics deter-
mine whether ring hydrogenation is favorable or not; an important
restriction, which is often overlooked.

3.3.3.1. Noble metals. Noble metals such as Pt [175,196,201,271,
276(cid:1)282], Pd [185,196,206,274,275,281,283(cid:1)286], and Ru [188,193,
196,271,278,287] have received significant attention in the HDO liter-
ature. Oh et al. [278] studied the HDO of miscanthus sinensis bio-oil
over carbon supported noble metals in a batch reactor pressurized to
30 bar at room temperature with H2, and reached a 78.2% degree of
deoxygenation over Pt/C at 350 °C. The HHV of the bio-oil was
increased by 61% during HDO and unstable sugar fragments (acetic
acid, furfural, vanillin, and levoglucosan) were reported to be con-
verted into stable compounds.

de Souza et al. [185] converted phenol (in vapor phase) over
Pd/SiO2, Pd/Al2O3, and Pd/ZrO2 at 300 °C and atmospheric pres-
sure in a fixed bed reactor. They reported the density of acid
sites (Brønsted and Lewis) to follow the trend: Pd/Al2O3 > Pd/
ZrO2 > Pd/SiO2. Compared to the other catalysts, Pd/ZrO2 was
reported to have a two times higher activity (determined as
TOF), and a three times higher selectivity towards benzene. A
physical mixture of Pd/SiO2 and ZrO2 showed similar activity to
the Pd/SiO2 catalyst, and it was therefore proposed that the
higher activity of Pd/ZrO2 was caused by interactions at the
metal-support interface, which are governed by the oxophilic
nature of ZrO2. The positive support effect from ZrO2 was con-
firmed for a Ni/ZrO2 catalyst [185] in agreement with the work
of Mortensen et al. [265]. Another approach is to use bimetallic
catalysts, in which an oxophilic metal like Fe is combined with a
hydrogenation active metal such as Pd [283,284] or Ni [273].

Different conclusions have been made when comparing the HDO
activity of noble metals compared to conventional hydrotreating
catalysts. Gutierrez et al. [281] investigated the conversion of guaia-
col over various catalysts in a batch reactor at 100 °C and 80 bar,
where the guaiacol conversion followed the trend:
Rh=ZrO2 >> Co (cid:1) MoS2=Al2O3 (cid:3) Pd=ZrO2 > Pt=ZrO2

Fig. 22. Comparison of DOD and oil yield in HDO of beech wood bio-oil with various
catalysts [196]. Experiments were performed in a batch reactor at mild (250 °C and
100 bar) and severe (350 °C and 200 bar) conditions over 4 h. All oil obtained at severe
conditions (except for Ni-MoS2/Al2O3 and Co-MoS2/Al2O3) consisted of a heavy and a
light oil fraction and hence, this data is represented as an average of both phases.

Gutierrez et al. [281] reported that the activity of the noble metal
catalysts was too high for comparison of the tested catalysts at
300 °C. However, HDO was primarily observed in experiments con-
ducted at 300 °C, whereas hydrogenation reactions were dominant
at 100 °C [281], which might be explained by 100 °C being too low
to facilitate C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond breaking.

Results from Wildschut et al. [196] are shown in Fig. 22 (see also
Table 6). They investigated the HDO of beech wood bio-oil in a batch
reactor operated at mild (250 °C and 100 bar) and severe (350 °C and
200 bar) conditions over 4 h. Mild conditions only led to a DOD of
35(cid:1)56%, while severe conditions resulted in a degree of deoxygen-
ation of 74(cid:1)86%. Especially Ru/C and Pd/C seemed promising with an
oil yield of (cid:2) 53% and a deoxygenation degree (cid:2) 85%. As it can be
seen, the sulfided Co-MoS2 and Ni-MoS2 catalysts were among the
poorest performing catalysts at both mild and severe conditions with
lower oil yields and DOD. However, no sulfiding agent was introduced
to the batch reactor to keep these catalysts in their active sulfide
form.

Even though noble metals are active in HDO reactions, they are
commercially unattractive due to their high price and limited avail-
ability [288]. In addition, they are highly sensitive towards sulfur
[263], which is present in biomass and bio-oil (see Table 1).

3.3.3.2. Non-noble metals. A cheaper alternative to noble metals is
e.g. Ni, which is the most widely applied non-noble reduced transi-
tion metal for HDO [120,138,183,285,289(cid:1)295]. Mortensen et al.
[292] studied the HDO of phenol over Ni/SiO2 in a batch reactor
operated at 275 °C and 100 bar. They reported both hydrogenation
and deoxygenation reactions to be dependent on the Ni particle
size as shown in Fig. 23 and related the TOF to particle size as well
as theoretical distribution of different metal sites (steps, corners,
facets). The rate of deoxygenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexane
increased linearly with increasing dispersion (decreasing particle
size), and a correlation with the fraction of exposed Ni step sites
was proposed. On the other hand, the decreasing rate of hydro-
genation of phenol to cyclohexanol with increasing dispersion
could not be linked to the exposure of a specific type of site possi-
bly because of the interplay with oxygen vacancies in the support
as discussed above.

Boscagli et al. [120] reported that Ni supported on active carbon
and various oxides (Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, ZrO2) had deoxygenation activ-
ities comparable to that of a Ru/C benchmark. The experiments were

performed in a pressurized batch autoclave (80 bar at room temper-
ature) operated at 250 °C using a wheat straw bio-oil. The O/C ratio
was reduced from around 0.6 to less than 0.3 for all catalysts. The
Ru/C catalyst possessed better hydrogenation activity resulting in an
H/C ratio around 1.7, whereas those from the Ni catalysts were in
the range of 1.3(cid:1)1.5.

Yakovlev et al. have investigated the activity of Ni and bimetallic
Ni-Cu catalysts for the HDO of anisole [290,291] and real bio-oil
[183,294]. Anisole conversion experiments in a fixed bed reactor
operated at 10 bar and 300 °C showed that complete deoxygenation
was achieved with Ni-Cu supported on Al2O3 and CeO2 with the fol-
lowing degree of HDO obtained [290]:

Ni (cid:1) Cu=CeO2 > Ni (cid:1) Cu=Al2O3 > Ni=Al2O3 > Ni=ZrO2

> Ni (cid:1) Cu=ZrO2 > Ni=SiO2

ð15Þ

In a thorough study on the HDO of pine bio-oil over a Ni-Cu/SiO2-
ZrO2 catalyst, Yin and Yakovlev et al. [183] performed experiments
at up to 200 bar and varying temperatures (60(cid:1)410 °C) in both a
batch reactor and a three stage fixed bed reactor setup. They focused
on the varying reactivity of cellulose and lignin derived oxygenates
(see Fig. 9), and showed how the O/C and H/C ratio in the upgraded
oil depended on the reaction temperature (see Fig. 24). The deox-
ygenation was continuously improved with increasing temperature
while the H/C ratio showed an optimum at intermediate tempera-
tures. This was explained by different reactions dominating at differ-
ent temperatures; i.e. aldehyde and ketone hydrogenation at low
temperature, condensation and elimination reactions at medium

temperatures, and hydrogenation and deoxygenation of aromatics
at high temperature. The poorer H/C ratios obtained in the continu-
ous setup compared to the batch reactor was explained by mass
transfer limitations and shows the importance of considering the
influence of the experimental design (reactor dimension, space
velocities, catalyst pellet size, and dilution) in fixed bed catalyst
activity studies. The critical parameter in batch reactors is the mix-
ing, which is determined by the stirrer speed and the dimensions of
the impeller and autoclave.

Bimetallic Ni-Fe catalysts have also been studied [204,273,296].
Nie et al. [273] studied bimetallic catalysts and reported that the
hydrogenation activity of a Ni/SiO2 catalyst could be modified by
adding oxophilic Fe, which facilitated hydrogenation of the carbonyl
group in the tautomerized keto form of phenolic species, which
could then be deoxygenated by dehydration.

3.3.4. Phosphides

As discussed in Section 3.3.2, Whiffen and Smith [254] reported
that an unsupported MoP had higher activity for HDO of 4-methyl-
phenol compared to the corresponding sulfides and oxides at the
given reaction conditions. Metal phosphides (especially Ni2P) have
shown promising activity and stability in HDO reactions [297(cid:1)302].
Additionally, there are studies on sulfided [173] and non-sulfided
[299] NiMoP systems used for HDO of furans and aromatic oxygen-
ates. Oyama et al. [297,303] investigated the HDO activity of several
phosphides (based on Ni, Co, Fe, W, and Mo) supported on SiO2. For
the conversion of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran in a fixed bed reactor at
300 °C and atmospheric pressure [303], MoP and WP showed the
highest selectivity towards HDO products while the overall TOF
decreased according to:
Ni2P > WP > MoP > CoP > FeP

ð16Þ

All catalysts were more active than a Pd/Al2O3 reference; an
improvement compared to previous results [297]. Guo et al. [205]
used Ni, Co, and Ru phosphide catalysts supported on activated car-
bon for HDO of hardwood bio-oil in a batch reactor at 300 °C and
110(cid:1)170 bar and compared the performance with that of a bench-
mark Ru/C catalyst (see also Table 6). Similar oil yields of 59(cid:1)64 wt%
was obtained for Ru/C, NiRuP/AC, CoRuP/AC, and the best performing
monometallic NiP/AC and CoP/AC catalysts. However, the degree of
deoxygenation was markedly improved with the monometallic
phosphides (DOD = 62(cid:1)65%) as compared to the bimetallic phos-
phides and the ruthenium benchmark (DOD = 42(cid:1)48%).

Moon et al. [298] investigated the conversion of guaiacol over
Ni2P/SiO2 at 1 and 8.1 bar of H2 in a fixed bed reactor operated at
300 °C during 30 hours on stream. A conversion of »80% was
achieved at 1 bar while 100% conversion was achieved at 8.1 bar.
Furthermore, the conversion was reported to follow a DDO route at

T.M.H. Dabros et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 268(cid:1)309

291

low H2 pressure and a HYD route at high H2 pressure. At 1 bar, the
main product formed was benzene (»60% selectivity), while it was
cyclohexane (»90% selectivity) at 8.1 bar. Slight oxidation of the
active phase in the spent catalyst exposed to 1 bar was evidenced by
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), particularly EXAFS [298].

3.3.5. Alternative catalysts

A range of other catalysts have also been investigated for the
HDO of bio-oil. Transition metal carbides and nitrides (typically
based on molybdenum or tungsten) have received increasing atten-
tion within the last decade [130,304(cid:1)308]. Their potential lies in
their low cost, similar hydrotreating (HDN, HDS) properties as con-
ventional sulfides [309] as well as properties, which bear some simi-
larity to noble metals [310]. Ruddy et al. [130] have presented a
detailed overview of model compound HDO studies over a broad
range of traditional and alternative catalysts including carbides and
nitrides. While studies on nitrides remain scarce it is clear that car-
bides are less attractive as they are sensitive to water [306,311],
which is inevitable in HDO. There are also examples of other reaction
conditions and catalyst systems in the HDO literature. These include
HDO in a sub- or super-critical liquid phase [312(cid:1)314], aqueous
phase HDO where a mineral acid is used to promote hydrolysis reac-
tions [204,270,315], use of boride catalysts [316], co-feeding a
hydrogen donor such as methanol [41], and more.

3.4. Role of support

Investigations of the influence of catalyst support in HDO have
been scattered over different catalytic systems and model com-
pounds. The role of the support depends on the catalyst system (e.g.
reduced transition metals or sulfides) and on the identity of oxygen-
ates subject to HDO (i.e. reaction mechanism).

In conventional hydrotreating, g-Al2O3 is the prevailing support
[163]. In HDO, however, Al2O3 has a number of undesired properties.
The high concentrations of water present in bio-oil, and formed dur-
ing HDO, can convert g-Al2O3 into Boehmite (AlOOH) [188,317]. This
decreases the activity as the transformation into Boehmite can trap
crystals of the catalytically active material in the support lattice
[317]. Furthermore, the high acidity of Al2O3 results in high coke for-
mation propensity. Popov et al. [177] linked the acidity of Al2O3 with
a high carbon formation affinity through saturation studies using a
phenol/argon flow where 2/3 of Al2O3 was covered with phenolic
species at 400 °C.

The acidity of various supported Ni catalysts was measured by
Mortensen et al. [265] by NH3 chemisorption and was seen to follow
a decreasing trend as follows:

Ni=Al2O3 (cid:2) Ni=ZrO2 (cid:2) Ni=CeO2 > Ni (cid:1) V2O5=ZrO2 > Ni=MgAl2O4

> Ni=CeO2 (cid:1)ZrO2 >> Ni (cid:1) V2O5=SiO2 > Ni=SiO2 > Ni=C

ð17Þ

The HDO of phenol at 275 °C and 100 bar H2 revealed no clear
relation between catalyst acidity and HDO activity. Instead, Morten-
sen et al. [265] found a correlation between the oxide support
metal-oxygen (M(cid:1)(cid:1)O) bond strength and the catalyst hydrogenation
activity (see Fig. 25). This was explained by the formation of O-
vacancies that act as Lewis acid sites [318,319] at the perimeter of
the Ni nanoparticle where phenol is adsorbed and hydrogenated to
cyclohexanol. Deoxygenation of the formed cyclohexanol was con-
cluded to take place on the Ni metal sites and therefore be indepen-
dent on O-vacancy formation.

Contrarily, Lee et al. [269] reported that the catalyst acidity and
HDO activity for guaiacol conversion in a batch autoclave at 250 °C
and > 40 bar H2 followed the same trend for a noble rhodium cata-
lyst, where NAC refers to nitric acid treated carbon black:
Rh=SiO2 (cid:1)Al2O3 > Rh=Al2O3 > Rh=NAC > Rh=ZrO2

Carbon has been proposed as a promising support [178(cid:1)180,196]
due to its low acidity and thereby low coke formation tendency
[178(cid:1)180]. The correlation between low acidity and low coke affin-
ity has also been reported for SiO2 [297], where Popov et al. [177]
showed that the concentration of adsorbed phenol on SiO2 only was
12% relative to the concentration on Al2O3 at 400 °C. While phenolic
species were concluded to only interact with SiO2 via hydrogen
bonds, dissociated species were strongly adsorbed on Al2O3 acid
sites [177,320]. Another study concluded that both Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/
AC caused a lower degree of deoxygenation compared to Ni/SiO2
due to a respectively too strong and too weak interaction between
support and anisole at 180(cid:1)220 °C and 5(cid:1)30 bar H2 [289]. High acid-
ity micro- and mesoporous materials such as hierarchical zeolites
and alumina doped silicates have been applied as HDO catalyst sup-
port [321(cid:1)323]. As mentioned, zeolites, which are commercially
used in the FCC process [158], typically have a high cracking activity,
which may limit the oil yield.

ZrO2, CeO2, and ZrO2(cid:1)(cid:1)CeO2 mixtures have received attention
as promising support materials [185,218,265,274,277,281,290,300,
324(cid:1)327]. These oxophilic carriers can potentially activate mole-
cules for HDO on the catalyst surface [185,290,327]. CeO2 is addi-
tionally known to be a versatile support with redox sites (oxygen
storage and exchange) and acid-base sites [328]. Recent studies on
ZrO2 have proposed that the monoclinic crystal phase (m-ZrO2)
has a higher propensity of forming catalytically active O-vacancies
than the tetragonal phase (t-ZrO2) [329]. It was however pointed
out by de Souza et al. [272] that the reaction rate of the deoxygen-
ation step considered by Foraita et al. [329] was independent on
ZrO2 morphology. In their studies [272], they found that the t-ZrO2
had more oxophilic sites compared to m-ZrO2, which promoted
deoxygenation.

SiO2, ZrO2, and TiO2 carriers have been shown to promote an
HDO reaction route for phenols, which involves a tautomeriza-
tion step (see Section 3.3.3) and it has been proposed that the
HDO activity can be tuned through the support oxophilicity
[174,185,271(cid:1)273,275]. For MoO3, which is active in HDO at low
H2 pressures, it was shown that the support plays an important
role in stabilizing redox-reactive Mo oxidation states [256] (see
Section 3.3.2).

Wu et al. [300] investigated the conversion of guaiacol in a fixed
bed reactor at 300 °C and atmospheric pressure over Ni2P supported
on Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2. The activity declined in the order Ni2P/
ZrO2 > Ni2P/Al2O3 > Ni2P/SiO2. The adverse properties of SiO2 were
elaborated by Moon and Lee [301], who performed a combined

activity and in-situ EXAFS study on the HDO of guaiacol over sup-
ported Ni2P. Experiments conducted in a batch reactor at 30 bar and
300 °C showed that while AC and ZrO2 supported catalysts had a sta-
ble conversion over time, Ni2P/SiO2 experienced significant deacti-
vation. EXAFS studies revealed that SiO2 was very sensitive to water
and via its hydrophilic character facilitated oxidation of the active
phase to nickel phosphate [301].

Bui et al. [218] investigated the conversion of guaiacol over
MoS2 and Co-MoS2 supported on ZrO2, TiO2, and Al2O3 in a fixed
bed reactor operated at 300 °C and 40 bar H2. Al2O3 catalyzed
demethylation and methyl substitution reactions at a rate 7 times
higher than for the other supports. The HDO activity of Co-MoS2/
ZrO2 per Mo atom was four times higher than that of Co-MoS2/TiO2
and Co-MoS2/Al2O3, while MoS2 on both ZrO2 and TiO2 had an
activity two times that of MoS2/Al2O3. Co-MoS2 on ZrO2 and TiO2
was stable for >60 h operation while a constant deactivation was
seen for Co-MoS2/Al2O3. The adverse effects of Al2O3 were ascribed
to its high acidity, which was expected to enhance coke formation
on the catalyst surface.

It is crucial to acknowledge that the choice of support material
affects the activity and selectivity of HDO catalysts and to include it
in the catalyst design. Three aspects are important concerning choice
and evaluation of support in HDO catalyst design:

- Propensity of carbon formation. This generally increases with

increasing acidity resulting in undesired coke formation.

- The interaction between the support and bio-oil oxygenates.
Adsorption of HDO reactants through oxygen vacancies/oxo-
philic sites in the support is possible.

- Stability against water and possibility for regeneration, e.g. by

burning off coke at high temperatures (>400 °C).

The evaluation of catalytic HDO activity using different sup-
ports must include considerations on fundamental properties
such as active phase dispersion (or particle size), surface area,
and pore volume/size distribution in order to allow proper com-
parison of different catalysts. Ideally, catalyst activities should be
reported as TOF. This requires determination of the concentration
of active sites, which relies on identifying the active site based on
suitable characterization techniques (e.g. chemisorption, spec-
troscopy, scattering, or electron microscopy), potentially coupled
with DFT.

3.5. Choice and influence of operating conditions

Reaction conditions for HDO should be chosen to facilitate high
catalyst activity over prolonged periods of time with minimum deac-
tivation. In this regard, different requirements will arise depending
on the feedstock and catalyst identity.

3.5.1. Temperature

HDO is typically carried out in the range of 250(cid:1)400 °C (see
Table 6), which should favor full HDO from a thermodynamic per-
spective [20], see also Fig. 10. The process should be operated
below »450 °C, if both deoxygenation and hydrogenation of aro-
matics is targeted. At higher temperatures, hydrogenation becomes
unfavorable, and the exothermic nature of HDO reactions could fur-
thermore limit the choice of temperature in a batch or fixed bed
reactor as full deoxygenation could lead to generating hot spots.
Additionally, coking increases with temperature, especially above
450 °C [181].

Elliott et al. [206] investigated the influence of temperature in the
HDO of wood derived bio-oil over a Pd/C catalyst in a fixed bed reac-
tor operated at 140 bar. Increasing the temperature from 310 °C to
340 °C increased the degree of deoxygenation from 65% to 70% but
above 340 °C cracking reactions became dominant. Increasing the

temperature from 310 °C to 360 °C had a negative effect on both the
oil yield, which decreased from 75% to 56%, and on the degree of
deoxygenation which decreased from 65% to 52%. At the same time,
the gas yield increased by a factor of three.

The change in reactivity with temperature is dependent on the
bio-oil composition and reactivity of individual species with the
more reactive oxygenates coming from cellulose and hemicellulose
and the more refractory oxygenates from lignin (see Section 3.1).
The catalytic upgrading can be performed in a dual stage continuous
process to achieve high degrees of deoxygenation with limited for-
mation of gas and coke (e.g. by cracking reactions). In dual stage
the first reactor is operated at mild conditions below
HDO,
250(cid:1)350 °C to stabilize the most reactive species, while the second
reactor is operated at higher temperatures, to facilitate complete
deoxygenation of refractory phenolic species [121]. Dual stage reac-
tor setups are thus targeted at minimizing coke formation from reac-
tive compounds, while enabling HDO of all types of oxygenates. An
early review of dual stage studies can be found in the work of Elliott
et al. from 2007 [166], while a more recent brief review was pro-
vided by Wang et al. [121] in 2013. Some more recent studies are
mentioned in the following.

Elliott et al. [330] used a single reactor with separate heating
zones in the hydroprocessing of a softwood bio-oil at (cid:3) 135 bar over
a Co-MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst. The temperature was set to 240(cid:1)250 °C in
the first zone and 380(cid:1)390 °C in the second, but the exothermal
reactions caused the measured temperature to be up to 60 °C higher.
The setup was operated continuously for up to 95 h. The degree of
deoxygenation reported was 98(cid:1)99% with a decent oil yield of
55(cid:1)58 wt% db. Catalyst deactivation was reported, and plugging due
to carbon residues was reported for one experiment, which was
started in succession of a former experiment without cleaning
the spent catalyst with acetone. The composition of the spent
catalyst was not reported. Elliott et al. [331] later showed simi-
larly promising results for a dual stage setup operated with a
sulfided Ru/C catalyst in the first stage and a Co-MoS2/Al2O3 cat-
alyst in the second stage. The carbon deposition on the spent
CoMo catalyst was around 10 wt%. In this work, they investi-
gated hot vapor filtration of the bio-oil feed and showed that the
content of Ca, Na, and K could be significantly reduced for
switchgrass bio-oil. Further dual stage HDO studies from Elliott
et al. can be found in [166,332,333].

In the previously mentioned work of Yin et al. [183], both a batch
reactor and a three stage HDO setup was employed in the conversion
of pine bio-oil at up to 200 bar. They followed the influence of tem-
perature on the composition of the produced oils by GC £ GC, gel
permeation chromatography (GPC), 1H NMR spectroscopy, thermog-
ravimetric analysis (TGA), the total acid number (TAN), the carbonyl
number (CAN), and more. Based on these analyses, they presented
the reactivity scale in Fig. 9, starting at a low temperature of
80(cid:1)180 °C, at which the small and most reactive oxygenates (formic
acid, glucose, levoglucosan, aldehydes, and ketones) would decom-
pose and be hydrogenated.

A clear advantage of the dual (or multiple) stage HDO pro-
cesses is the immediate possibility to stabilize the bio-oil in steps
while it is re-heated. The different compound classes can be tar-
geted at separate temperatures using different catalysts types.
Severe catalyst deactivation as well as coking and reactor plugging
has however also been observed in dual stage HDO studies. For
example, Routray et al. [129] used Ru/C at 130 °C followed by Pt/
ZrP at 300(cid:1)400 °C to upgrade oak bio-oil in a dual stage setup
and reported that reactor plugging occurred after 55(cid:1)71 h for all
their experiments. Since thermally induced re-polymerization
reactions may occur at <200 °C [188], it is recommended to oper-
ate the first stage in a dual (or triple) stage HDO setup at lower
temperatures to reduce carbon deposition leading to plugging
and/or catalyst deactivation.

3.5.2. Residence time

A fairly low liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 0.1(cid:1)1.5 h¡1
(corresponding to a high residence time) is generally applied in HDO
processes to obtain high degrees of deoxygenation [30,137,334]. For
example, Elliott et al. [206] investigated the HDO of bio-oil over a
Pd/C catalyst at 140 bar and 340 °C and observed that the oxygen
content in the product oil decreased from 21 to 10 wt% when the
LHSV was decreased from 0.70 h¡1 to 0.25 h¡1. For sulfided catalysts,
a low LHSV also helps to prevent incorporation of sulfur into the pro-
duced oil [137]. There are, however, cases of a slight negative effect
of a lower LHSV due to enhanced cracking and coke formation [201].

3.5.3. Hydrogen pressure

A high H2 pressure of 100(cid:1)300 bar has traditionally been applied
in HDO processing of bio-oil (see Table 6). It is generally favorable in
order to saturate unstable species, suppress coke formation, and
ensure a high solubility of hydrogen in the oil leading to an increased
availability of hydrogen at the catalyst surface [188,210]. Neverthe-
less, many recent studies have been concentrated on the HDO of
model compounds at near atmospheric pressure, which allows for a
simpler process [185,252,255,256,298,303].

It has been reported how different reactions (i.e. DDO/DCO or
HYD) can be controlled through the H2 pressure [202,286,298],
which is in agreement with the thermodynamics. The thermody-
namic restrictions (see Fig. 10) should always be kept in mind, as the
equilibrium will determine which reaction pathways are favorable.
Mortensen et al. [20] looked into the hydrogen consumption in the
HDO of bio-oil, which was studied by Venderbosch et al. [188] (see
Fig. 26). The slope of hydrogen consumption increases as a function
of the degree of deoxygenation, which can be related to the differ-
ence in reactivity and hydrogen consumption of different oil constit-
uents (see Section 3.1). For HDO of the least reactive phenolic
species, a high hydrogen consumption is required (see Table 4) as it
proceeds through the HYD path, which results in a hydrogen con-
sumption surpassing the stoichiometric demand for oxygen removal
at high deoxygenation degrees. The H/C ratio of the produced oil
increases when hydrogenation (saturation of double bonds) occurs.
As a result, the heating value of the oil increases and it has been
reported that the HHV of upgraded oil is proportional to the hydro-
gen consumption with an increase of 1 MJ/kg for every mol H2 con-
sumed per kg feed [335].

Fig. 26. Measured H2 consumption as a function of degree of deoxygenation for the
HDO of forestry residue bio-oil over a Ru/C catalyst operated in a fixed bed reactor at
175(cid:1)400 °C and 200(cid:1)250 bar including proposed extrapolation until 100% DOD
[188]. Comparison with stoichiometric requirement re-calculated with 31 wt%
organic bound oxygen and a H2:O requirement of 1 (based on [20]). Adapted from

3.6. Catalyst deactivation

Catalyst deactivation is a key bottleneck in the development of
industrially robust HDO processes. Deactivation generally occurs
from exposure to water and due to coking, sintering of the active
phase, poisoning by nitrogen, sulfur (except for sulfides) or chlo-
rine species, and metal deposition (especially alkali metals)
[137,138,186,188,195,203,336,337]. Catalyst type and operating
conditions influence the nature and severity of deactivation, but
deactivation from carbon deposition and water is generally domi-
nant in HDO catalysis.

Mortensen et al. [138] studied the influence of sulfur, chlorine, and
potassium on a Ni/ZrO2 catalyst tested for HDO of guaiacol in 1-octa-
nol at 250 °C and 100 bar. The results are shown in Fig. 27. Sulfur
(added as 1-octanethiol) caused rapid deactivation of the catalyst due
to the sulfidation of Ni particles into NiSx. Both potassium (added as
KNO3 and KCl) and chlorine (added as chloro-octane) deactivated the
catalyst. For chlorine, the deactivation was shown to be reversible, as
the activity could be regained after removal of chlorine from the feed.
With all tested poisons being strong, it was concluded that sources of
sulfur and alkali metals must be removed from the feed upstream of
any HDO unit operating with reduced Ni based catalysts. Mortensen
et al. [137] also found that a Ni-MoS2/ZrO2 deactivated in the pres-
ence of alkali and chlorine, so it seems these species are general poi-
sons to HDO catalysts. Alkali metals can potentially be removed with
the ash rich char formed during pyrolysis (by filtering the pyrolysis
vapors before condensation), but the gaseous sulfur compounds are
more difficult to remove. Therefore, sulfur tolerant catalysts, mainly
sulfides, show promise as they need sulfur in the gas to stay active.

3.6.1. Water

Water is a known catalyst poison to many catalyst systems,
where it can either interact with the active phase and inhibit the tar-
get reactions or degrade the support material, e.g. by accelerating
sintering processes or in the case of g-Al2O3 by conversion into
Boehmite (AlOOH) [188,317]. Water formed during pyrolysis of bio-
mass is mixed into the bio-oil, and additional water is formed during
the subsequent HDO due to the high concentration of oxygen in the
feed. It is therefore important to develop water tolerant catalysts; an
important aspect, which is often overlooked in HDO research.

For sulfide catalysts, there is a risk that water may saturate active
sites (CUS) through chemisorption, which limits oxygenate adsorp-
tion and thereby inhibits HDO. As mentioned in Section 3.3.1.1,
Badawi et al. [213,242] performed DFT calculations showing that a
partial pressure ratio of H2S/H2O > 0.025 is needed to avoid S-O
exchanges at the S-edges of MoS2, while 100% Co promotion at the
S-edge inhibited S-O exchange in the H2S/H2O range of 10¡5(cid:1)102 at
350 °C [213]. However, as mentioned by  ̧Senol et al. [243], contradic-
tory conclusions on the effect of water have been presented in the
literature. In order to understand the influence of water on HDO, it is
important to apply both theoretical and analytical tools (as in [213]
and [174]) as well as being able to distinguish between the influence
of water from those of other parameters such as operating condi-
tions (e.g. H2, H2S, temperature), feed identity and catalyst support.

Looking into the other catalyst classes, phosphides operated at
low H2 pressures are oxidized by water and lose their activity [298].
Carbides have also been reported to deactivate as a function of water
induced oxidation [203]. Oxide catalysts may be subject to active site
saturation in a similar manner as sulfides with the difference that
oxides cannot be treated with H2S to remove water from the active
phase. For MoO3, it has been indicated that deactivation by water
can be mitigated by controlling the ratio of H2/H2O [252,253]. How-
ever, this ratio must be carefully controlled, as oxides can only be
exposed to a low (near or sub atmospheric) H2 pressure in order to
avoid reduction [254,255].

doped with 1-octanethiol (S addition) and chloro-octane (Cl addition) during the run to test deactivation induced by sulfur and chlorine, respectively. Adapted from [138] with
permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry.

3.6.2. Carbon deposition

Carbon formation occurs through polymerization condensation
reactions at the catalytic surface. The resulting polyaromatic (poten-
tially also polyaliphatic) species adsorb strongly to the catalyst sur-
face and block active sites and fill up the pore volume, which in turn
reduces reaction rates, especially during initial operation [336]. Fon-
seca et al. [338,339] reported that carbon deposition in a Co-MoS2/
Al2O3 catalyst used for hydrotreating of a fossil feed mainly occurred
during an initial deposition stage, which led to occupation of about
one third of the total pore volume by carbon. The carbon deposition
after this initial deposition was limited. A more severe carbon depo-
sition is expected for bio-oil, which has a high polymerization and
coking propensity compared to fossil oils.

The reaction rates of carbon formation depend strongly on the
feed, but process conditions can be controlled to reduce carbon for-
mation; i.e. by lowering the temperature, increasing the hydrogen
pressure, and decreasing the space velocity of the feed bio-oil.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as aromatics and alkenes have a
high affinity for carbon formation as they have a significantly stron-
ger interaction with the catalyst surface compared to saturated ana-
logues [336]. For oxygenates, the propensity of coking is increased
for compounds with more than one oxygen atom in its structure
[336,340] while carbonyls (i.e. ketones) may polymerize through
aldol condensation [341].

Carbon formation increases with increasing catalyst acidity;
Lewis acidity is responsible for chemisorbing compounds to the
catalyst surface, and Brønsted acidity is responsible for forming
polymerization active carbocations through proton donation
[336]. For HDO catalysts where the reaction mechanism involves
acid sites, coke formation on these sites is critical. Additionally,
organic acids (e.g. acetic acid) in the feed can catalyze thermal
degradation of bio-oil constituents increasing the affinity for car-
bon deposition [287].

In terms of mitigating coke formation during HDO, elevated tem-
peratures should be avoided. The rate of dehydration increases at
higher temperatures leading to increased carbon formation [336].
Furthermore, H2 can be used to stabilize reactive coke precursors.
For a Co-MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst, H2 has been shown to effectively
decrease carbon formation by saturating adsorbed species such as
alkenes [336].

A simple model for the loss of HDS and HDO activity over a Co-
MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst due to coking was proposed by Yamamoto et al.
[342]:
(cid:4)
k 1⁄4 k0 1(cid:1)Qc

ð19Þ

(cid:5)

Here, k is the apparent rate constant during deactivation, k0 is the
rate constant over the fresh catalyst, and Qc is the fraction of active
sites covered by coke. The model proposes an apparent proportional
correlation between the extent of carbon deposition on the catalytic
surface and the resulting degree of catalyst deactivation [336].

Weber et al. [341] proposed that coking during processing of bio-
oil is dominated by gelation reactions, forming 2-D and 3-D poly-
mers by thermally induced polymerization and aldol condensation
as opposed to linear chain growth. Using gelation kinetics, they suc-
cessfully modeled the increased pressure drop from carbon deposi-
tion in a dual bed setup consisting of a sulfided Ru/C catalyst
operated at »180 °C followed by a promoted MoS2 catalyst operated
at »400 °C [341].

3.6.3. Regeneration and activity control

Only a few detailed studies on regeneration of HDO catalysts
have been published. However, the need for catalyst regeneration
must be assessed in the development of HDO processes. If a catalyst
based on cheap and abundant materials is applied, it may simply be
replaced when necessary, although too frequent regeneration or
replacement may be impractical.

In industrial naphtha-reforming, the commonly applied Pt-Re/
Al2O3 catalyst deactivates over time due to coke deposition, contam-
ination with impurities from the feed, and loss of chlorine, which is
used as a promoter for the acid function of Al2O3 [343]. The regener-
ation process includes coke burn-off followed by an oxo-chlorination
step, which re-introduces chlorine into the catalyst structure and re-
disperses the metal phase, which sinters during the coke burn-off
[343]. A similar regeneration process may be possible for noble
metal based HDO catalysts.

In FCC units, continuous regeneration is ensured by letting spent
catalyst run through a coke-burnoff unit upon recycling into the
reactor. This could be favorable for oxide catalysts [255,256]. Pra-
somsri et al. [255] investigated for the HDO of various phenolic com-
pounds over a bulk MoO3 catalyst. The catalyst lost 50% of its activity
within the 24 h test, despite the low reactant concentration of
1.5 vol.%, due to a combination of reduction of the oxide phase and
carbon deposition, but could be regenerated by oxidation in pure O2
(atmospheric pressure) for 3 h at 400 °C (see Fig. 28). Deactivation
rates at such scale may require the reaction to take place in a circu-
lating fluid bed reactor or a moving bed reactor, or to have several
parallel reactors in swing operation.

If coke burn-off is used to regenerate sulfides, a separate sulfida-
tion step is needed to reactivate the active phase, which is oxidized
during the coke burn-off. Sulfidation could also be used to

295

so stable operation can be obtained by increasing the temperature
throughout the run. This should be done until catalyst deactivation
is so severe that a stable activity cannot be maintained through fur-
ther temperature increase. At this time, the catalyst should be regen-
erated or renewed. For bio-oil, this strategy may however have the
pitfall that increased temperature can lead to excessive coking of the
reactor upstream of where the catalyst is active.

3.7. Kinetic models

A comprehensive review on kinetic studies on the HDO of both
petrochemical and biomass derived model oxygenates was provided
by Furimsky [168]. Several more recent studies also provide kinetic
models for the HDO of model compounds, but only a few kinetic
studies of HDO of bio-oil have been performed. In this case, lumped
kinetic expressions have been developed due to the complexity of
the feed.

Sheu et al. [201] investigated the HDO of pine wood bio-oil over
supported Pt/Al2O3-SiO2, Ni-MoS2/Al2O3, and Co-MoS2/Al2O3 in a
fixed bed reactor at »350(cid:1)400 °C and 45(cid:1)105 bar with a WHSV of
0.5(cid:1)3.0 h¡1. The kinetics were evaluated based on the expression:

(cid:1)dwO
dZ

1⁄4 k ¢ wm
O

¢ Pn

ð20Þ

Here, wO is gram of oxygen in the hydrotreated oil divided by
gram of oxygen in the raw bio-oil, Z (cm) is the axial position in the
reactor, k is the rate constant defined by an Arrhenius expression, P
(kPa) is the total pressure (mainly H2), m is the reaction order for
oxygen in the hydrotreated bio-oil, and n is the reaction order for
the total pressure. Sheu et al. [201] assumed a first order depen-
dency on oxygen (i.e. m = 1) for all three catalysts. It was possible to
fit the pressure dependency and activation energy to the data as
summarized in Table 7. With n in the range of 0.3(cid:1)1.0, increased
hydrogen pressure had a positive effect on the rate of deoxygenation
as expected. The activation energies were found to be in the range of
45.5 to 71.4 kJ/mol with that for the platinum catalyst being the low-
est. The dependency on oxygen mass fractions and axial reactor
position limits the model to the specific experimental setup and
feed.

A similar kinetic model was presented by Su-Ping et al. [211] who
investigated the HDO of bio-oil (feedstock not stated) using a Co-

regenerate a catalyst deactivated by water, if this is not circum-
vented by adjustment of the H2S/H2O ratio during operation. Badawi
et al. [213] exposed a Co-MoS2/Al2O3 sample to water at 350 °C. This
decreased the uptake of CO (a measure for sulfide active sites) mea-
sured by infrared (IR) spectroscopy at a frequency of 2072 and
2055 cm¡1 by 28%. It was concluded that the catalyst could be regen-
erated by resulfidation as the CO uptake on the resulfided sample
was similar to that of the initial sample.

Industrial hydrotreating catalysts are regenerated by ex-situ com-
bustion to remove coke deposits [344]. Deactivation occurs throughout
the entire catalyst lifetime of several years, and thus, the operating
conditions are used to control the catalyst activity until regeneration
becomes the last option to regain activity. This deactivation occurs in
stages, initially mainly by coking and in the end predominantly by
pore blockage (see Fig. 29a) [336], and the overall activity can be
maintained by increasing the temperature. It is important to increase
the temperature stepwise according to the deactivation. If the temper-
ature increase is introduced before sufficient deactivation has
occurred, it may result in accelerated coking (see Fig. 29b) [181].

The stability of sulfides used for HDO of bio-oil is challenged by
the large fraction of water present compared to traditional hydro-
treating. As described above, adjustment of the H2S level in the feed
gas should be used to keep the catalyst in the active sulfided form,

pressure was omitted due to a low dependency observed in the
range of 15(cid:1)30 bar H2. The oxygenate reaction order of 2.3 is higher
than the assumed first order dependency of Sheu et al. [201]. Su-
Ping et al. [211] found an activation energy of 91.4 kJ/mol, which is
also higher than the values reported by Sheu et al. [201]. Neverthe-
less, the complexity and diversity of bio-oil feeds as well as differen-
ces in reactor setup, choice of catalyst, and process conditions makes
it difficult to compare kinetic models across various studies. For the
model presented by Su-Ping et al. [211], the high oxygenate reaction
order could be explained by a high initial reaction rate caused by
very reactive species. As these react and disappear, a rapid decrease
in the rate will be observed.

Massoth et al. [221] developed a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type
kinetic model for the HDO of methyl substituted phenols over Co-
MoS2/Al2O3 in a fixed bed reactor at 28.5 bar and 300 °C:

(cid:1)dx
dt

1⁄4 k1 ¢ KA ¢ x þ k2 ¢ KA ¢ x
ð

ð22Þ

Here, x denotes mole fraction of phenol, whereas C0 denotes the
feed concentration. KA (m3/mol) is the equilibrium constant for the
adsorption of phenol onto the catalyst, t ((kg ¢ h)/m3) is the space
time, and k1 and k2 (mol/kg/h) are reaction rate constants for DDO
and HYD of phenol, respectively. Nie et al. [277] presented a more
complex Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model for the HDO of m-
cresol over a Pt/SiO2 catalyst operated at 300 °C and atmospheric
pressure in a fixed bed reactor. Their model took into account the
partial pressures of m-cresol, 3-methyl-cyclohexanone, 3-methyl-
cyclohexanol, toluene, methylcyclohexane, and 3-methyl-1-cyclo-
hexene. Direct deoxygenation of the arylic C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond was consid-
ered through a tautomerization/secondary hydrogenation pathway
as opposed to hydrogenolysis. Mortensen et al. [265] took a simpler
approach for the screening of a broad range of catalysts and their
activity in the conversion of phenol in a batch reactor at 275 °C and
100 bar. They used a set of global reaction rate expressions of the
type:
ri 1⁄4 k0

ð23Þ

¢ Cy

i

Here, ri refers to the rate of hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohex-
anol (i = 1) and the deoxygenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexane
(i = 2), respectively. k’ (mL/kg/min) is the lumped rate constant
(assuming constant hydrogen pressure) and Cy represents the con-
centration of phenol (y = 1) and cyclohexanol (y = 2) in the liquid.

Clearly, working with HDO of model compounds allows for a
more detailed investigation of reaction pathways and enables a
more comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms
and kinetics over different catalysts. Setting up detailed kinetic mod-
els for HDO of real bio-oil including all possible reaction pathways is
challenging due to the high complexity of the feed, as apparent from
the still highly simplified network in Fig. 12.

General applications of kinetic models for HDO of model com-
pounds are obviously limited, but they can be used for screening of
catalyst activity, by comparing the value of the determined reaction
rate constants, as shown by Mortensen et al. [265]. Kinetic expres-
sions developed for the HDO of real bio-oil feeds describe the

deoxygenation on an overall level, but are highly dependent on the
conditions applied (e.g. feed identity, reactor configuration, and
operating conditions). On the other hand, detailed mechanistic
expressions developed for model compound HDO are limited to the
specific model compound(s) of choice, and expanding this type of
model for all bio-oil components is very complex. These compro-
mises on accuracy and applicability of kinetic models are well-
known from conventional hydrotreating, where it has been shown
that simple and generalized models (similar to Eqs. (20) and (21))
are useful tools in the development and optimization of catalysts
and reaction conditions [163].

3.8. Perspectives of HDO as upgrading technique for condensed bio-oil

Catalytic HDO studies have focused either on upgrading con-
densed bio-oil or selected model compounds. Studies on HDO of
condensed bio-oil involves the complexity of working with real
feeds. They enable application at industrially relevant operating con-
ditions and they use a diverse multi-compound feed, which means
that the experiments are subject to adverse phenomena such as inhi-
bition and coking, which must also be dealt with at large scale. On
the other hand, model compound studies allow for catalyst develop-
ment at a more fundamental stage. This is necessary in order to
understand and optimize the catalyst formulation and operating
conditions, for example via detailed investigations of reaction net-
works, thermodynamics, kinetics, and catalyst deactivation.

In short, both real feed and model compound studies are needed
to develop and optimize industrially relevant processes that com-
bine fast pyrolysis and catalytic HDO, with the latter potentially per-
formed on the pyrolysis vapors before condensation of the oil. Based
on the findings presented throughout this section, sulfided catalysts
currently seem to provide the most flexible operating window for
the HDO of bio-oil. They have a high HDO activity and they are sulfur
tolerant, water tolerant (when co-feeding H2S and using a different
support than g-Al2O3), stable against high H2 pressure (which is nec-
essary to minimize coking), moderately priced, and regenerable.
Depending on the exact process, operating conditions, and bio-oil
composition targeted, most of the catalyst types reviewed above
could be possible HDO candidates, although it seems that especially
noble metals struggle with high price, low abundance, and risk of
deactivation by bio-oil contaminants.

In Section 2.4 it was concluded that bio-oil cannot be used as an
engine fuel, partly because of its instability. This issue also limits the
potential for single stage HDO as a feasible upgrading technique for
condensed bio-oil. The reactive oxygenates, which originate from
cellulose and hemicellulose [166,168,183,187], cause severe coking
and polymerization resulting in fixed bed reactor plugging and cata-
lyst deactivation [188], which strongly challenges the development
of a continuous process. While it seems that multiple stage HDO
could overcome these issues, it is advised to assess the stability of
the feed oil during storage and mild heating. This should be done in
order to ensure that feeding and heating of the oil to the first stage is
possible, even for long times of continuous operation, which may
require that the operating temperature is increased upon catalyst
deactivation as discussed in Section 3.6.3. If instead HDO is per-
formed in vapor phase, prior to condensation of the produced oil,
reactive intermediates can be hydrogenated and stabilized immedi-
ately when formed. Processes combining fast pyrolysis and HDO are
reviewed in Section 4.

4. Combined biomass fast pyrolysis and catalytic product
upgrading

As reviewed by Resende [345], it has been considered to perform
combined fast pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading as a method for
obtaining a stabilized, higher quality bio-oil, either with a catalyst in

the pyrolysis reactor and/or with a downstream reactor for upgrad-
ing pyrolysis vapors before oil condensation. An overview of the pos-
sible reactor configurations is given in Fig. 30. The background for
this is the adverse properties of fast pyrolysis bio-oil and the difficul-
ties in upgrading by subsequent HDO as outlined in the preceding
sections. Catalytic fast pyrolysis is typically performed in fluid bed
reactors, where the bed material acts as both heat transfer material
and catalyst. Reactors for downstream vapor upgrading are typically
fixed bed reactors.

Catalytic fast pyrolysis at atmospheric pressure and without
hydrogen addition has been intensively investigated using zeolite
catalysts for cracking the bio-oil to achieve lower oxygen content
(around 24 wt%) and higher aromatic content compared to standard
fast pyrolysis [47]. Such a bio-oil is easier to upgrade by HDO. How-
ever, as discussed by Venderbosch [47], the product of catalytic fast
pyrolysis is either a low yield of bio-oil and high yield of char, with
low energy recovery in the oil, or a bio-oil resembling non-catalytic
fast pyrolysis bio-oil.

Another method, which is aimed at achieving both deoxygen-
ation and fast pyrolysis in one step, is fast hydropyrolysis, in which
the gas is changed from an inert to H2 or partial H2 (scenario a in
Fig. 30). If an HDO catalyst is present in the reactor it is called

catalytic fast hydropyrolysis (scenario b in Fig. 30). Catalytic fast
hydropyrolysis is often performed at elevated pressure to increase
the driving force for HDO. This approach has been more successful
in achieving both high energy recovery and bio-oil with low oxy-
gen content [47]. Both non-catalytic and catalytic fast hydropyrol-
ysis can be coupled with downstream HDO, performed in a fixed
bed reactor, for vapor phase product upgrading (scenario c and d
in Fig. 30).

The different concepts in Fig. 30 each have their advantages
and disadvantages. An advantage of not having a catalyst in the
pyrolysis reactor (scenario a and c) is that the optimal tempera-
ture of »500 °C for fast pyrolysis (see Fig. 4) can be applied with-
for the
out having to also consider what might be optimal
catalytic HDO reactions. Note, however, that without the HDO cat-
alyst, the H2 used in fast hydropyrolysis typically does not enable
significant HDO [346(cid:1)349]. Therefore, the advantage of in-situ
HDO is not obtained here, and it becomes crucial to have a short
residence time before the downstream HDO reactor to avoid sec-
ondary reactions such as polymerization [105]. For concepts with
a catalyst in the fluid bed (scenario b and d), the choice of catalyst
becomes crucial; a too reactive catalyst may crack all species to
light gases, and no oil phase is formed. This was observed by

pyrolysis, (c) Fast hydropyrolysis and downstream catalytic HDO (fixed bed) on pyrolysis vapors, (d) Catalytic fast hydropyrolysis and downstream catalytic HDO (fixed bed) on

Dayton et al. [350] using a commercial hydrotreating catalyst (pre-
reduced). Initially, mostly gaseous products were obtained, but
due to catalyst deactivation a liquid product was obtained after
»20 hours on stream.

4.1. Lab-scale tests

Milligram scale pyrolysis-GC setups allow for fast pyrolysis of
biomass and immediate product analysis [125,351(cid:1)356]. Catalytic
fast hydropyrolysis is achieved by mixing the biomass with a cata-
lyst and applying a flow of H2.

Investigations by Melligan et al. [351,352] using a pyrolysis-
GC setup (the CDS Analytical Pyroprobe) have shown different
bio-oil product distributions between non-catalytic fast pyrolysis
using He and H2 [351,352], particularly an increase in alkanes
and oxygen free aromatics was observed with increasing H2
pressure [352]. The oxygen content in the product was further
decreased by adding a downstream HDO reactor using a Ni based
catalyst [351,352].

Using a similar Pyrolysis-GC setup, Gamliel et al. [353,354] found
that catalytic fast hydropyrolysis at 31 bar and 600 °C using M-ZSM-
5 (M = Ni, Pd, Ru) as catalysts most resulted in increased CH4 (M = Ni
and Ru) or CO (M = Pd) yields, and decreased char and aromatics
yield compared to H-ZSM-5. Marchand et al. [355] found that Pd-
ZSM-5 increased the aromatics yield compared to H-ZSM-5 in cata-
lytic fast hydropyrolysis of lignin at 17 bar and 650 °C. However,
they used larger catalyst to biomass ratios compared to Gamliel et
al. (20/1 and 10/1 in ref. [355] vs. 5/1 in refs. [353,354]). Performing
non-catalytic fast hydropyrolysis at 650 °C and employing a down-
stream HDO reactor loaded with the Pd-ZSM-5 and operated at 300
or 400 °C increased the yield of cycloalkanes due to the hydrogena-
tion of aromatics.

Fast pyrolysis investigations by Thangalazhy-Gopakumar et al.
[356] showed minor differences between He and H2 atmos-
pheres, also for catalytic fast pyrolysis, however the H-ZSM-5
catalyst employed had no hydrogenation activity. Using H-ZSM-5
impregnated with Co, Ni, Mo, or Pt as catalysts for catalytic fast
hydropyrolysis of pinewood at 27.6 bar improved the hydrocar-
bon yield compared to using the H-ZSM-5 catalyst [125]. This
was attributed to the hydrogenation activity of
the metal
impregnated catalysts.

4.2. Pilot scale fluid bed and cyclone reactors

Fast pyrolysis of rice husks in a fluid bed reactor using sand as the
bed material reported by Meesuk et al. [346(cid:1)348] showed that
changing the atmosphere from N2 to H2 only had a minor influence
on bio-oil oxygen content and heating value. However, in combina-
tion with an active catalyst (i.e. performed as catalytic fast hydropyr-
olysis) the oxygen content was significantly reduced and the heating
value was increased. Fluid bed fast pyrolysis of biomass in N2, CO2,
CO, CH4 and H2 at atmospheric pressure reported by Zhang et al.
[349] showed only minor product differences as function of gas
atmosphere.

Pilot scale studies of fluid bed fast hydropyrolysis of loblolly pine
performed by Dayton et al. [350] showed almost no deoxygenation
at 400 °C when using inert SiC as the bed material and a low partial
pressure of H2 (0.5(cid:1)3.0 bar). The oil product of fast hydropyrolysis
contained 35(cid:1)39 wt% oxygen compared to 38(cid:1)40 wt% oxygen after
fast pyrolysis in N2. When changing the bed material from inert SiC
to a pre-reduced commercial hydrotreating catalyst, a high degree of
deoxygenation was achieved at 375 °C and 3.0 bar H2 (4.2 wt% oxy-
gen in the oil compared to 43.5 wt% in the feed). However, the oil
yield was only about 10 wt% after »20 h on stream. The catalyst for-
mulation was not published, but the oil yield improved as the cata-
lyst deactivated with a stable oxygen content in the produced oil of
2 to 5 wt% [350]. The same group later performed catalytic fast
hydropyrolysis of loblolly pine in a smaller fluid bed reactor using a
NiMo hydrotreating catalyst at 375 to 475 °C and 20.7 bar of 20(cid:1)40%
H2 [357]. The catalyst was activated by reduction rather than sulfida-
tion, and the state of the catalyst was not investigated, but it is likely
to be Ni metal on MoOx/Al2O3, where x = 2 to 3. The carbon efficiency
was 36 to 42% while the organic liquid yield was around 23 wt%
(including C4+ gasses). The typical oxygen content in the organic liq-
uid was 3 to 5 wt%, indicating high yields and good oxygen removal
efficiency. The time on stream was 90 min for these experiments.

A process referred to as H2Bioil (see Fig. 31) involving fast hydro-
pyrolysis at elevated pressure and downstream HDO of pyrolysis
vapors was published by Agrawal and Singh et al. [358(cid:1)360]. The
process combines fast hydropyrolysis with vapor upgrading to pro-
duce a bio-oil compatible with the current transportation fuel infra-
structure. The pyrolysis gas may be recycled to the pyrolysis reactor
or utilized in a gas turbine and the char is combusted or gasified to

provide heat and/or H2 for the process [358,359]. In another process,
it was suggested that the pyrolysis gas may be steam reformed to
produce H2 for the process [361]. Additional H2 for the process may
be obtained from electrolysis of water or biomass/coal gasification
[358,359]. An economic analysis based on estimated yields indicated
that the process compared very favorably to second generation bio-
ethanol production and biomass gasification combined with Fisher-
Tropsch fuel synthesis [359,360].

The H2Bioil concept was partly verified by an experimental investi-
gation using pure cellulose as biomass, an inverted cyclone fast hydro-
pyrolysis reactor operated at 550 °C and a fixed bed HDO reactor with
Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, or Ru/Al2O3 as catalysts operated at 375 °C with 9 bar
H2 partial pressure and 27 bar total pressure [362]. The degree of
deoxygenation obtained in those experiments was only 14(cid:1)27%. In a
follow-up study the HDO catalyst was improved by using Pt(cid:1)Mo sup-
ported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The residence time in the
HDO reactor was more than doubled and the conditions adjusted to
480 °C in the pyrolysis reactor, 300 °C in the HDO reactor and 25 bar
H2 pressure, resulting in close to 100% deoxygenation using both cellu-
lose and poplar wood as biomass [361]. No liquid oil was recovered,
only an aqueous phase, so the bio-oil composition and yield was only
based on GC analysis of the gas phase.

A similar concept called IH2(cid:1) (see Fig. 32) was developed by the
Gas Technology Institute (GTI) [363,364]. This process consists of a
fluid bed catalytic fast hydropyrolysis reactor at moderate pressure
(20(cid:1)25 bar) and temperature (335(cid:1)470 °C) and downstream HDO
(345(cid:1)400 °C) in a fixed bed reactor (i.e. configuration d in Fig. 30)
using unpublished, proprietary catalysts. The bio-oil can be inte-
grated in the current infrastructure and the gas should be steam
reformed to produce H2 for the process [21]. A proof of principle
experimental investigation of the hydropyrolysis and HDO steps of
the process showed that fast hydropyrolysis was possible with sev-
eral different types of biomass feedstock with a time on stream of
2(cid:1)3 h [363]. Typical oxygen contents in the bio-oil were <0.5 wt%,
and with 26 to 30 wt% bio-oil yield the energy recovery in the oil rel-
ative to the biomass feed was approximately 65%. Operation without
the downstream HDO reactor resulted in 0.5(cid:1)2.5 wt% oxygen in the
bio-oil; an oil which is likely to be stable enough and miscible with
petroleum for co-feeding in a refinery hydrotreater.

The lab-scale process was scaled up to a 50 kg/day pilot facility
where the same oil yield and oxygen contents were achieved over
750 h continuous operation using maple and pine wood [364]. Also,
a life cycle assessment (LCA) and a techno-economic analysis of an
industrial size process was published [365,366] showing 90 to 96%
GHG savings of IH2(cid:1) bio-fuels from bagasse, forest residue or corn
stover compared to fossil fuels and an minimum fuel selling price of
1.64 US$/gal (2007 values, excluding taxes, distribution, blending,
and marketing), which is favorable compared to other biomass to
fuel processes. This compares well with US gasoline prices, which in
2011 were 2.8(cid:1)3.3 US$/gal and in 2016 were 1.4(cid:1)2.1 US$/gal (range
covers several grades, excluding taxes) [367]. With the fluctuating
oil prices [4,7] and reported uncertainties in the LCA [365,366], the
resulting bio-fuel price indicates a promising potential, but should
otherwise be used with caution.

Recently Zhang et al. [368] at Philips 66 performed fast hydropyr-
olysis of red oak wood in a fluid bed reactor with inert sand as the
bed material followed by vapor phase HDO in a second fluid bed
reactor using a proprietary hydrotreating catalyst. Using 19 bar
hydrogen pressure, a pyrolysis temperature of 425 °C and an HDO
temperature of 350(cid:1)425 °C, they could adjust the oxygen content in
the bio-oil to between 17 and 2 wt%. Below 6 wt% oxygen in the bio-
oil, the most reactive oxygenates were removed. The TAN along with
the storage and thermal stability were similar to fossil diesel and
better than soybean oil used for bio-diesel, indicating that these bio-
oil products could blend into refinery streams. The carbon atom
yield for the low oxygen bio-oils was 35 to 44%, which is similar to
the results achieved with pressurized catalytic fast hydropyrolysis
by Marker et al. [363,364] and Dayton et al. [357]. In a follow up
NMR study of their bio-oils they showed that alkylation and/or
transalkylation reactions on aromatic compounds took place in the
HDO reactor with increasing significance at higher temperatures
(particularly at 425 °C) where the degree of deoxygenation increases
[369].

Similar results have also been obtained by the authors of this
review, as we have recently performed catalytic fast hydropyrolysis
of beech wood in a fluid bed reactor containing a sulfided CoMo/
MgAl2O4 catalyst with and without a downstream fixed bed reactor
containing a sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst [370]. At varying pressures

of 16(cid:1)36 bar and temperatures of 365(cid:1)510 °C, the yield of con-
densed and condensable C4+ organics was 17(cid:1)22 wt% daf. The oil
was essentially oxygen free when applying both reactors and the
energy recovery in this oil product was 40(cid:1)53%. Extensive oil char-
acterization was performed showing that most hydrocarbons were
naphthenes and aromatics, with minor amounts of paraffins, in the
gasoline and diesel boiling point range. When using only the fluid
bed reactor the oxygen content was 1.8 wt%. Interestingly, the
downstream fixed bed reactor both increased the carbon yield and
decreased the oxygen content, indicating that alkylation reactions
with olefins on aromatic compounds occurred over the NiMo/Al2O3
HDO catalyst, as also reported by the group at Philips 66 [369].

4.3. Perspectives of fast pyrolysis with ex-situ and in-situ
hydrodeoxygenation

Overall, it appears that to realize biomass to hydrocarbon fuels
using a fast pyrolysis based process, fast hydropyrolysis at elevated
pressure using a high partial pressure of H2 is a possible method.
Most likely, it is advantageous if the pyrolysis step is catalytic, and
downstream vapor HDO will be necessary to achieve a product with
low oxygen content. Alternatively, oil condensed after catalytic fast
hydropyrolysis may be co-processed in a refinery hydrotreater.
There are a number of technical challenges to overcome in the scale-
up e.g. feeding solid biomass to a pressurized fluid bed reactor. The
catalyst formulation is highly important and questions about poison-
ing and mechanical degradation in the fluid bed as well as possible
regeneration have yet to be answered.

Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass produces oil with an
increased volumetric heating value compared to its parent biomass
(see Section 2). In fact, the bulk energy density can be increased by
a factor of >6 through fast pyrolysis [153,371]. There is however
limited direct application for this bio-oil due to the high content of
oxygen which is responsible for a wide range of detrimental prop-
erties. Upgrading of this bio-oil is necessary through catalytic HDO
carried out at conditions similar to conventional hydrotreating or
even at lower temperatures and pressures. As reviewed in Section
3, several studies on catalytic HDO show promising results for this
technique. However, as the vast amount of research studies have
shown (see Sections 3 and 4), it seems advantageous to couple fast
pyrolysis and HDO into catalytic fast hydropyrolysis in order to
develop a technology which can continuously convert solid biomass
into liquid fuel. Coke formation could be minimized by maintaining
a high hydrogen pressure during catalytic fast hydropyrolysis. If
instead HDO is performed on condensed oil in a separate step, coke
formation should be limited by multiple stage processing (see Sec-
tion 3.5.1). Here, the reactive cellulose and hemicellulose derived
oxygenates are hydrogenated in the first part of the HDO reactor at
low temperature (from below 80 °C to 180 °C), and the final part of
the HDO reactor cracks and deoxygenates the refractory lignin
derived oxygenates at high temperatures (>300 °C)
[183]. A
decrease in temperature in the outlet part of HDO reactor could be
employed, if hydrogenation of aromatics is desired (according to
the thermodynamic constraint). Regarding the more traditional one
stage HDO with a single reactor operated at 250(cid:1)400 °C (see Table
6), coking during heating of the oil will be so severe that catalyst
deactivation, low energy recovery of the oil, and plugging make the
process infeasible.

It has been proposed that fast pyrolysis of biomass into bio-oil
can be implemented at delocalized sites to increase the energy den-
sity and make transportation economically feasible [20,371]. Mor-
tensen et al. [20] presented a flow sheet for this process based on
the work of Jones et al. [372] (see Fig. 33) where raw bio-oil is pro-
duced at delocalized sites and subsequent upgrading is performed at
a centralized plant. Here, HDO is used to upgrade the oil with a

downstream recovery section similar to that applied in hydrotreat-
ing processes [158,163].

Even with a seemingly promising process economy [372], imple-
mentation of delocalized pyrolysis plants is challenged by the insta-
bility of bio-oil, which cannot be reheated as required for
subsequent HDO without severe coking and polymerization. This
hurdle can potentially be overcome either by applying multiple
stage HDO to achieve bio-oil stabilization during heat-up, or by per-
forming the pyrolysis as catalytic fast hydropyrolysis. Catalytic fast
hydropyrolysis could either be performed at delocalized or more
centralized plants, since transportation of wood pellets across coun-
try boarders (and even continents) for combustion in combined heat
and power plants is already feasible [152]. The produced bio-oil will
most likely need further upgrading to achieve a fuel grade oil, which
could be realized at existing oil refineries by co-processing with fos-
sil feeds. This would eliminate the need for construction and
commissioning of new plants.

Centralized plants are more favorable in terms of the H2 require-
ment, which is significant for both catalytic fast hydropyrolysis and
catalytic HDO, and it is clear that the hydrogen consumption should
be addressed in the development of a commercially attractive pro-
cess. One option is to reform the light gasses produced in the fast
hydropyrolysis (C1-3 hydrocarbons) into CO2 and H2 which can then
be fed to the pyrolysis reactor. Additional H2 could potentially be
produced sustainably from electrolysis of water using electricity
from wind and solar power. H2 could potentially also be produced
from the gasification of char. Another utilization strategy for the
light gasses could be conversion into synthetic natural gas (SNG) by
methanation.

Techno-economic analyses or LCAs can be used to evaluate
whether a process is economically viable and allows for comparison
of different processes. Such analyses have been performed for vari-
ous fast pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading processes, for example
stating that transportation of solid biomass is viable within a radius
of <170 km [153]. As these analyses are based on a complex network
of data and assumptions (i.e. agricultural yields, energy prices, pro-
cess efficiencies, and yields), it is recommended to interpret the
results with caution, especially if an uncertainty and sensitivity anal-
ysis is left out.

It must be considered what type of product the combined fast
pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading should produce. Table 8 gives an
overview of the oil properties achieved by different methods. Even
though HDO of condensed bio-oil produces an oil with a low oxygen
content and high energy content, the instability of condensed bio-oil
is a critical drawback. Instead, catalytic fast hydropyrolysis produces
an oil similar to the HDO oil [363] but with the possibility to operate
the process continuously for several hundred hours [373]. If the cat-
alytic fast hydropyrolysis is coupled with downstream HDO, the pro-
duced oil is further upgraded; the oxygen content is markedly
decreased while the contents of carbon and hydrogen are increased.
An important parameter, which is missing in Table 8, is the carbon
based yield of the produced oil relative to the dry, solid biomass
feed. As mentioned in Section 3.2, the carbon based yield or data,
which can be used to calculate this, is most often not reported in
bio-oil upgrading studies. This makes it difficult to assess the overall
process efficiency, and it is strongly recommended to include the
carbon recovery in the produced oil in all future studies.

In catalytic fast hydropyrolysis, biomass particles are in direct
contact with the catalyst, which also acts as heat carrier. There is a
risk that this enables a detrimental transfer of poisons such as alkali
metals from the biomass or char particles to the surface of the cata-
lyst [48]. It is therefore crucial to investigate this potential (and
likely) deactivation, ideally as a function of time or at least the com-
position of fresh and spent catalysts should be analyzed to assess the
severity of any deposition of catalyst poisons. If fast pyrolysis is
applied instead, hot vapor filtering can be used to remove

contaminants upstream of the HDO upgrading, but a negative influ-
ence on the oil yield has been reported in this configuration [331].

The boiling point of oxygenates is higher than for fuel type
hydrocarbons with equivalent carbon numbers [157]. Thus, the
oxygen content should preferentially be tuned to fit the target
product, which could be a range of boiling point fractions. Fuel
compositions are complex [374], and it is necessary to look at the
specifications for the target fuel as well as what can be achieved
from the biomass and process of choice. A common goal in the lit-
erature is to go all the way from solid biomass to a high-quality
liquid fuel (cid:1) preferably in one step. Complete deoxygenation of
bio-oil is, however, often only achieved using severe operating

conditions (see e.g. Fig. 22 and Table 6), which limit the oil yield.
Furthermore, as discussed above, re-heating of condensed bio-oil
can cause severe process issues due to coking, polymerization, and
reactor plugging. Therefore, catalytic fast hydropyrolysis seems
promising as reactive oxygenates can be stabilized in-situ when
formed. It may be of interest to target a less deoxygenated product
to be used as a fuel additive (similar to ethanol or methanol) or to
be co-processed in already functioning hydrotreating plants.

The investigation of coupled fast pyrolysis and catalytic HDO,
such as catalytic fast hydropyrolysis, is still at an early stage and the
technology needs to mature before more concrete considerations,
for example based on LCAs, can be made regarding the process

economy and sustainability, and application of the product oil. Fur-
thermore, the requirements for (fluid bed) hydropyrolysis catalysts
differ from those of commonly applied HDO catalysts. Firstly, they
must have a high mechanical strength in order to ensure attrition
resistance during fluidization. Secondly, a moderate or even low
activity could be preferential in order to avoid extensive cracking or
potential generation of hot spots (in fixed bed reactors). Thirdly,
they must be tolerant against contaminants present in the feed. If
fast pyrolysis is instead performed without a catalyst, this first stage
is simplified, but the carrier gas would most likely still be hydrogen,
which is needed for downstream HDO. The catalysts and tempera-
tures selected for downstream HDO must furthermore be carefully
selected to avoid polymerization and coking related issues.

5. Conclusions and outlook

The global society is facing challenges with global warming,
depleting fossil resources, an increasing population, and a corre-
sponding increase in energy demand. Our lifestyle depends on energy
and there is a need for sustainable carbon based fuels. Lignocellulosic
biomass such as wood, energy crops, straw, and agricultural waste is
a renewable carbon based material that does not compete directly
with food; note, however, that considerations on usage of agricultural
land must be included. Fast pyrolysis is a simple and efficient way to
convert solid biomass into a liquid with an increased volumetric
energy density. The significant oxygen content (35(cid:1)50 wt% compared
to <0.1 wt% in heavy fuel oil) results in a heating value less than half
that of conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, as much of the oxygen
is present as carboxylic acids, ketones, and aldehydes, bio-oil is acidic
and unstable upon storage and heating.

Catalytic HDO is a promising technique for upgrading bio-oil, and
much research has been devoted to developing and understanding
catalyst systems as well as reaction and deactivation mechanisms.
Particularly deactivation is a major issue in HDO, where coke deposi-
tion and exposure to high water concentrations pose a severe prob-
lem for many catalysts and influence both catalytic activity and
selectivity. Due to the thermal instability of bio-oil, catalytic fast
hydropyrolysis with immediate product stabilization seems an alter-
native, promising approach compared to sequential non-catalytic
fast pyrolysis and single stage HDO of the condensed oil. Catalytic
fast hydropyrolysis can be coupled with downstream HDO of the
pyrolysis vapor for further product upgrade, prior to condensation of
the produced oil. Another option is to couple non-catalytic fast
pyrolysis with downstream HDO of the pyrolysis vapor. However,
for all three options (catalytic fast hydropyrolysis with and without
downstream HDO, and fast pyrolysis with downstream HDO), sev-
eral tasks remain, such as:

- Catalyst development for both (fluid bed) catalytic fast hydro-
pyrolysis and downstream fixed bed HDO to optimize liquid
yields: Investigation and optimization of known formulations as
well as novel catalyst materials in combination with advanced
experimental and theoretical tools such as DFT, TEM, STM, XAS,
and tomographic techniques. Catalysts operated in fluid bed
hydropyrolysis reactors and fixed bed HDO reactors must meet
different specifications. In a fluid bed, the catalyst must be
mechanically strong to avoid attrition and entrainment. Also,
the catalyst should not be too active at 400(cid:1)600 °C, which is the
temperature range for maximum oil yields, since this would
lead to an undesired loss of carbon from the biomass to cracking
products such as CO, CO2, CH4, and C2-4 hydrocarbons. Finally,
the coke formation on the catalyst surface should be minimized
to limit the need for catalyst replenishment in the fluid bed dur-
ing operation. In a down-stream fixed bed, there is greater flexi-
bility in the choice of catalyst and operating conditions, since it
is decoupled from the pyrolysis, and these choices should be

based on the pyrolysis gas composition and the target oil com-
position.

- Better understanding of the kinetics of HDO occurring during
catalytic fast hydropyrolysis including influence of impurities
(e.g. alkali metals) on secondary reactions (e.g. cracking), which
affect the selectivity towards HDO. Model compound studies
using multi compound feeds should be employed in order to
investigate how the HDO kinetics of various oxygenates are
influenced by the presence of other compounds (e.g. through
competitive adsorption). Developing a better generic under-
standing of the influence of the biomass and pyrolysis vapor
composition on the HDO kinetics and selectivity should support
the realistic scenario that a biomass to bio-oil unit should be
able to run efficiently with different feeds.

- Comprehensive investigation of catalyst deactivation (such as
attrition, coking, phase change) and poisoning by elements
abundant in biomass (such as alkali metals, chlorine, nitrogen,
water, and sulfur) for different catalyst types in order to opti-
mize catalyst performance. Catalyst deactivation should be
mitigated and/or efficient regeneration methods should be
developed.

- Investigation of catalytic fast hydropyrolysis of solid biomass
directed at minimizing coke formation and cracking, and stabi-
lizing reactive oxygenates. The influence of varying operating
conditions for catalytic fast hydropyrolysis (temperature, H2
partial pressure, space velocity, gas flows, etc.) should be inves-
tigated to optimize oil yield, deoxygenation, and energy yield in
the produced oil.

- Development of new processes and reactor configurations for
continuous processes including: fast pyrolysis with downstream
catalytic HDO, catalytic fast hydropyrolysis, and catalytic fast
hydropyrolysis with downstream catalytic HDO. This develop-
ment should cover feeding of solid biomass into a pressurized
reactor, catalyst regeneration and/or replacement, and inte-
grated utilization of by-products (such as char, light gasses,
product water, system heat). Long-term tests should eventually
be performed to test the stability and robustness of the process.
- Assessment of target product(s). The operating conditions and
catalyst type(s) should aim at the desired product composition
(e.g. oxygen content in produced bio-oil) and yields (gas vs. bio-
oil). The product could e.g. be a moderately oxygenated fuel
additive or refinery blend-in, or an oxygen free ready-to-use
fuel. A very important parameter to keep in mind when studying
and comparing the efficiency of these processes, is the carbon
yield and energy yield in the produced oil compared to the feed
biomass.

With all the work already performed on fast pyrolysis of biomass
and on catalytic HDO of the condensed bio-oil and model com-
pounds, the task at hand is to apply this knowledge in the further
research, development, and demonstration of combined fast pyroly-
sis and HDO processes. This development is in its infancy, but several
proof of concept studies already exist. Thus, what remains is a
directed scientific and commercial effort within an appropriate
political frame to ensure the development of an efficient route for
renewable liquid fuels from biomass, which can be included in the
future energy supply system.
