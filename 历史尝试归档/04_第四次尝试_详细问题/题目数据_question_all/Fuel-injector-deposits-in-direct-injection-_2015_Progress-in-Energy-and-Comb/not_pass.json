Explain the physical significance of the rate constants K₁ and K₂, and discuss how engine operating conditions (injection pressure, nozzle temperature) affect these constants.",
    "standard_answer": "Starting from the net deposit rate equation: dV/dt = K₁ - K₂·V. This is a first-order linear differential equation. Solving it: dV/dt + K₂·V = K₁. Using integrating factor e^(K₂·t): d/dt(V·e^(K₂·t)) = K₁·e^(K₂·t). Integrating both sides: V·e^(K₂·t) = (K₁/K₂)·e^(K₂·t) + C. Applying initial condition V(0)=0: 0 = (K₁/K₂) + C ⇒ C = -K₁/K₂. Thus V·e^(K₂·t) = (K₁/K₂)·(e^(K₂·t) - 1). Rearranging: V = (K₁/K₂)·(1 - e^(-K₂·t)). The fuel flow rate loss is proportional to the deposit volume V, hence: Fuel flow rate loss = -K₁/K₂·(1 - e^(-K₂·t)). K₁ represents the deposit formation rate constant, dependent on fuel thermal stability (olefin content, T90) and nozzle temperature. K₂ represents the deposit removal rate constant, dependent on fuel injection pressure and shear forces. Higher injection pressure increases K₂, accelerating deposit removal. Nozzle temperature affects both K₁ (increases with temperature via pyrolysis) and K₂ (increases with temperature enhancing removal). This model explains the observed flow loss pattern: rapid initial loss followed by stabilization as formation and removal rates balance.",

    "standard_answer": "From fluid mechanics perspective, deposits alter spray characteristics: 'spray angle and envelope are likely to be affected, and spray penetration distance as well as droplet diameter can be increased.' Larger droplets reduce evaporation rate and increase wall impingement. From combustion perspective, deposits on injector tip absorb liquid fuel, causing diffusive combustion near nozzle: 'higher soot emission was found with a fouled injector resulting from diffusive combustion near the injector tip due to liquid fuel absorbed on deposits.' This localized rich combustion generates soot particles (accumulation mode). Meanwhile, incomplete combustion increases HC emissions which form nucleation mode particles via condensation. However, the research shows 'the total PM emission of injector 1 was increased mainly because of the increase of the accumulation mode PM emissions.' The nucleation mode increase is less significant because HC condensation is secondary compared to direct soot formation from fuel-rich zones.",

    "question_text": "Explain the controversial role of T90 and nozzle temperature in deposit formation. Discuss why reducing nozzle temperature below T90 doesn't always reduce deposits, and why increasing temperature above T90 doesn't always promote them, referencing the data in Figure 6.",
    "standard_answer": "The controversy stems from two competing mechanisms. Kinoshita's hypothesis suggests nozzle temperature > T90 promotes deposit formation because 'most of the liquid fuel was evaporated resulting in the deposit precursors adhering strongly to the nozzle wall.' However, experimental data shows injector flow rate losses at 184°C were lower than at 173°C for several fuels. This is because deposit formation rate (K₁) and removal rate (K₂) both increase with temperature. At lower temperatures (<140°C), both rates are low. As temperature rises, K₁ increases faster initially. But above ~173°C, K₂ (removal rate) increases more rapidly due to enhanced fuel scouring effects. Thus, the relationship is non-monotonic: at very high temperatures, removal dominates. Additionally, the composition of deposit precursors varies with fuel chemistry. When nozzle temperature exceeds T90, light fractions evaporate but heavy fractions may polymerize slower. The transition temperature where K₂ overtakes K₁ depends on fuel properties and injector design.",

    "standard_answer": "Multi-hole injectors are most vulnerable because small deposits in micrometer-scale orifices significantly disrupt flow: 'multi-hole injectors are highly vulnerable to deposits formed inside the nozzle.' Swirl injectors have larger flow passages but suffer from 'poorly atomized pre-spray structure.' Outward-opening injectors have several advantages: 'conical shape and zero SAC volume prevents carbon formation.' The SAC volume in inward-opening designs traps residual fuel which undergoes thermal degradation. Outward-opening designs eliminate this volume. Additionally, 'the deposit built up may only influence spray pattern, not the flow rate' for outward-opening designs due to their different internal geometry. The 'robustness of the inward opening injectors against fouling can be improved by appropriately designing the needle tip and seat.' Fluid dynamically, the outward needle movement creates different shear patterns that reduce deposit adhesion. The counter-bore design in outward-opening nozzles reduces edge effects where deposits typically initiate.",
