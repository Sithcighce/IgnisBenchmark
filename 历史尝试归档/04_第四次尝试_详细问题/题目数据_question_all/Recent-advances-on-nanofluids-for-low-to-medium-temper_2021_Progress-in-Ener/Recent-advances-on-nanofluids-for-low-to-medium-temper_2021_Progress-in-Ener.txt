The eﬃcient exploitation of solar irradiation is one of the most encouraging ways of handling numerous 
environmental concerns. Solar collectors are suitable devices that capture solar irradiation and convert it 
into thermal energy and electricity. In the last years, the nanoﬂuids used in solar thermal systems have 
been studied as a useful technique for enhancing the solar collectors’ performance and establishing them 
as viable and highly eﬃcient systems. The present review paper aims to summarize and discuss the most 
important numerical and experimental studies in nanoﬂuid-based solar systems for application at low 
and medium temperature levels, while the emphasis on the fundamental physical phenomena that occur. 
In the ﬁrst part, numerous numerical models and the principal physical phenomena affecting the heat 
transfer rate in the nanoﬂuid have been analyzed. More speciﬁcally, the importance of different forces in 
nanoﬂuid ﬂows that exist in particulate ﬂows such as drag, lift (Magnus and Saffman), Brownian, ther- 
mophoretic, Van der Waals, electrostatic double-layer forces are considered. Moreover, an overview of the 
thermophysical properties, physical models, heat transfer models, and evaluation criteria of nanoﬂuids are 
included in this work. In the second part, which is the main part of this work, a comprehensive review is 
performed to gather and discuss the new advantages in the nanoﬂuid-based solar collectors that operate 
at low and medium temperatures. More speciﬁcally, the examined solar systems are the ﬂat plate collec- 
tors, the evacuated tube collectors, the direct absorption collectors, and the thermal photovoltaic systems, 
while the investigated applications are space-heating, space-cooling, household hot water production, de- 
salination, industrial activities, and power generation. The aforementioned collectors and applications are 
the most usual in the real systems, indicating the importance of the present work. Moreover, the em- 
phasis is given in the thermal, exergy, economic, and environmental evaluation of the studied systems, 
as well as in the discussion of the possible limitations of the use of nanoﬂuids like the lack of long-term 
stability, the agglomeration of nanoparticles, and the increased pumping work due to the increased pres- 
sure drop. Finally, it is found that the nanoﬂuid utilization usually enhances the collector eﬃciency up 
to 5%, while higher enhancements can be found in thermal photovoltaics. Moreover, it is concluded that 
there is a need to emphasize issues such as stability and the use of eco-friendly solar systems. Lastly, the 
ﬁeld’s future trends are highlighted, and a clear image of the present situation and the next steps in the 
ﬁeld are given.

1. Introduction 

Heat exchangers used in thermal systems had been consider- 
ing  as  a  big  challenge  for  heat  transfer  researchers  for  decades. 
The working ﬂuid in thermal systems e.g., automotive radiators or 
cooling of electronic devices were almost conventional heat trans- 
fer  ﬂuids  such  as  water;  however,  thanks  to  the  introduction  of 
“nanoﬂuids” ﬁrstly by Choi in 1995 [1] , a variety of nanoparticle 
types, shapes, concentrations, and states have been tested in dif- 
ferent  types  of  ﬂuids  to  observe  heat  transfer  enhancement  ca- 
pacity and to ﬁnd out whether such new-born nanoﬂuids can sat- 
isfy the demand for saving energy in the global thermal system 
industries.  The  nanoﬂuid  term  is  deﬁned  as  suspending  speciﬁc 
volume concentrations of nanoparticles in speciﬁc ﬂuids while the 
whole nanoﬂuid is stable, and no nanoparticle precipitation is ob- 
served [2] . One of the simple nanoﬂuids was ceramic nanoﬂuids, 
which were prepared by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) group 
[3] . Shortly afterward, a new step forward in the ﬁeld of nanoﬂu- 
ids was the emergence of metal oxide nanoﬂuids [4] . Xuan and Li 
[5] reported, for the ﬁrst time, the suspending copper nanoparti- 
cles in transformer oil as nanoﬂuids. Since then, nanoﬂuids have 

become a hot topic of research for researchers around the world 
[ 6 , 7 ].  Nanoﬂuids  are  considered  as  a  new  and  advanced  type  of 
working  ﬂuid  due  to  its  superior  properties  like  higher  thermal 
conductivity ( k ), more stability, etc. [8-10] . 

Nanoﬂuids  can  have  signiﬁcantly  better  heat  transfer  charac- 
teristics than conventional ﬂuids depending on the nanoparticles 
used, the size of the nanoparticles, and the concentration of the 
colloidal suspension [11-14] . The potential to interact with liquids 
at  the  molecular  level  contributes  to  improving  thermophysical 
properties such as thermal conductivity, thermal diffusion, viscos- 
ity, and viscosity heat transfer factors compared to those of con- 
ventional  liquids  (oil,  water,  etc.)  [ 15 , 16 ].  Several  reported  stud- 
ies  have  shown  that  nanoﬂuids  exhibit  an  improved  k  and  con- 
vective heat transfer coeﬃcient ( h ) compared to the conventional 
ﬂuids  [17-19] .  In  addition,  other  properties  such  as  the  speciﬁc 
heat ( c p ) and density ( ρ) are also signiﬁcant thermophysical prop- 
erties  of  nanoﬂuids  [20-23] .  Having  considered  the  wide  appli- 
cability  of  nanoﬂuids  in  various  energy-based  industries  such  as 
solar  thermal  collectors  [ 16 , 24-27 ],  solar-powered  air  condition- 
ing [28] , heat exchangers [29-31] , electronics cooling [32] , mini- 
mum quality lubrication (MQL) [ 12 , 33 ], aerospace [34] , nuclear re-

as  schematically  described  in  Fig.  1 ,  the  researchers  are  encour- 
aged to have classiﬁed, comprehensive, and clear insight into each 
branch. 

On the other hand, the urgent need for reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions has been clearly recognized as there is no doubt that 
the globe needs to be focused on renewable energies and should 
be renewable powered as much as every country could. The United 
Nations have cleared this pathway in the Sustainable Development 
Agenda. Technologies associated with renewable energy are con- 
sidered  sustainable  and  eco-friendly  due  to  their  lower  environ- 
mental footprint compared to traditional technologies [41] . Thus, 
renewable energy, such as solar energy [42] , has begun to attract 
more attention than before, as it provides a promising solution to 
achieve sustainable development as well as address global warm- 
ing [ 43 , 44 ]. 

The most typical devices in the commonly established solar en- 
ergy systems are Photovoltaic (PV) systems and solar thermal col- 
lectors utilization [45-47] which are used for solar energy for elec- 
tricity production (PVs) [48] and high eﬃciency and low cost for 
domestic and industrial heating [ 49 , 50 ], respectively. Since around 
80% of the solar radiation to the PV panels is converted to heat or 
reﬂected, the temperature of the panels increases which negatively 
affects the PV eﬃciency in converting solar energy to electricity 
[51] . Thus, the hybrid PVT solar collector was suggested and evalu- 
ated by many researchers [52-55] to eliminate the generated heat 
through a working ﬂuid such as water or air just like a heat ex- 
changer to use the heat for other purposes. It is also used to gen-

erate warm water or hot air or both at the same time while the 
eﬃciency of photovoltaic mainly depends on solar radiation and 
temperature [56] . 

The ﬂat plate collector (FPC) is a mature solar technology which 
is used for over 40 years without special modiﬁcations. Moreover, 
ﬂat plate solar collectors are known as the best productive solar- 
based heaters while having rather low thermal eﬃciency and out- 
put temperature. However, as the creation and installation process 
is not much complicated, and they are much suitable for low tem- 
perature solar thermal energy, such collectors are widely used in 
houses and industries. This type of collector was ﬁrst studied and 
developed in the 1950s, and numerous approaches have been pro- 
posed to enhance its thermal performance and eﬃciency during 
their 60-years life. Evacuated tubes solar collector is more eﬃcient 
than ﬂat plate collector [57] . In fact, the main part of such col- 
lectors  is  the  outer  evacuated  transparent  tube,  while  the  inner 
one is coated for maximum absorption of sunlight. There is a vac- 
uum between the cover and the absorber to eliminate the radia- 
tion thermal losses and enhance the collector thermal eﬃciency. 
In  such  collectors,  a  copper  heat  pipe  with  an  absorber  plate 
welded to it can be also utilized in the inner tube [58] , as usual 
design. 

It is evident that researchers have a great interest in different 
types of solar collectors, but the incident radiation passes through 
many thermal resistances to supply the collected heat to the user 
[59] . Consequently, improving the eﬃciency of solar collectors mo- 
tivated researchers to propose a liquid solar collector in the 1970s, 
where a black liquid was used to absorb solar radiation directly 
[60] . Due to the direct absorber of solar radiation by the liquid, 
the thermal heat losses will reduce. The liquid solar collector was 
known later as Direct Absorption Solar Collector (DASC) [61] . How- 
ever,  the  eﬃciency  of  DASC  is  limited  to  the  optical  properties 
of  the  working  ﬂuid,  mainly  the  spectral  absorptivity  and  spec- 

tral emissivity, which is poor for the conventional working ﬂuids 
[ 62 , 63 ]. The addition of nanoparticles to the working ﬂuid will in- 
crease its absorptivity and that due to the multi-absorption pro- 
cess of the scattered radiation because of the presence of particles 
within the ﬂuid [64-66] . The enhancement of the optical proper- 
ties  of  the  working  ﬂuid  after  the  addition  of  nanoparticles  de- 
pends on the particle size, shape, and optical properties of the par- 
ticles themselves as well as the optical properties of the base ﬂuid 
[ 67 , 68 ]. DASCs can also be classiﬁed as solar collectors, and they 
can operate at low, medium, and high-temperature levels [69] . This 
type  of  classiﬁcation  is  essential  for  determining  the  base  ﬂuid, 
nanoparticle option, broadband or selective solar absorption [68] , 
and the state of matter used as the heat transfer carrier [ 70 , 71 ]. 
Thermal eﬃciency improvement is one of the critical parameters 
for solar thermal systems in determining the usefulness of nanoﬂu- 
ids [ 72 , 73 ]. 

The severe diﬃculty for solar energy applications is how to en- 
hance the effectiveness of the solar collector [74] . It can be done 
by augmenting the assembly of the collector or emerging a differ- 
ent kind of heat transfer ﬂuid. Presently, water and thermal oils 
are widely used in the solar collector as a heat transfer medium. 
However, the low thermal conductivity of them as the base ﬂu- 
ids is a drawback [75] . Due to the lower thermal conductivity of 
the conventional working ﬂuids, many scholars are trying to use 
the nanoﬂuid as the heat transfer ﬂuid in solar collectors. Using 
nanoﬂuids as a heat transfer cooling within the collector can be an 
effective way to improve the eﬃciency of the system [76] . Nanoﬂu- 
ids present higher thermal conductivity than the respective base 
ﬂuids because the nanoparticles lead to higher heat diffusion in- 
side  the  ﬂuid.  Thus,  the  heat  transfer  rate  with  the  nanoﬂuids 
presents relatively high values. Moreover, the increased nanoﬂuid 
viscosity due to the addition of nanoparticles increases the heat 
transfer coeﬃcient.

Moreover,  using  nanoﬂuids  leads  to  CO 

2  reduction  and  saves 
annual electricity and fuels [77] , and The use of nanoﬂuids can re- 
sult in an overall reduction in the size and cost of the solar col- 
lector systems [78] . Another advantage of the nanoﬂuid utilization 
is the reduction the radiative and convective losses due to the en- 
hanced heat transfer between the nanoﬂuid and the absorber plate 
[79] . On the other hand, the high cost of nanoparticles [80] , their 
stability issues [ 15 , 81 ], the corrosion problems [82] , and increased 
pumping power [ 83 , 84 ] are the main disadvantages of this tech- 
nology [15] . 

Using solar energy as the main supply for electrical power and 
heating purposes guarantees several environmental, economic, and 
even maintenance beneﬁts. These beneﬁts lead to the interest and 
investment  in  this  type  of  energy  trends  to  be  growing  due  to 
the concern for the climate and environmental changes happen- 
ing  globally  [ 85 , 86 ].  The  primary  focus  of  this  article  is  divided 
into two sections. In the ﬁrst section of the paper, various math- 
ematical models and the main physical phenomena affecting the 
heat transfer rate in the nanoﬂuid ﬂows have been examined. Sev- 
eral  forces  exist  in  particulate  ﬂows,  such  as  drag,  lift  (Magnus 
and Saffman), Brownian, thermophoretic, van der Waals, electro- 
static double-layer forces, and their importance in nanoﬂuid ﬂows 
are studied. Moreover, an overview of the thermophysical proper- 
ties,  physical  models,  heat  transfer  models  and  evaluation  crite- 
ria of nanoﬂuids are included and the second part of the paper 
reviews the energy, exergy, economic analysis and environmental 
effects  of  nanoﬂuids  used  in  different  low  to  medium  tempera- 
ture solar devices to produce electricity and heat for various do- 
mestic and industrial purposes using different renewable technolo- 
gies. This paper presents various research works done in this re- 
gard  which  can  be  useful  for  further  investigations.  Due  to  the 
thermal losses linked with the absorber temperature, solar ther- 
mal systems cannot be regarded as heat exchangers practically. The 
improvement in the thermal eﬃciency parameter is considered as 
a suitable parameter for assessing the thermal development of a 
thermal system. This review article considers the energy and ex- 
ergy eﬃciency as well as the entropy generation. The review ends 
with  a  brief  discussion  on  the  challenges  and  the  research  gaps 
at the present stage, with future directions for potential research 
hotspots. 

2. The present study: Literature gap and the novelty 

Various  review  works  in  the  literature  present  the  eﬃcacy 
of nanoﬂuids’ applicability in solar collectors [ 57 , 87-98 ]. None of 
them is comprehensively dedicated to a wide range of solar col- 
lectors with various energy, exergy, economic and environmental 
analysis. A scientiﬁc gap exists in the literature, which is a lack of 
full and comprehensive review work on important and commonly 
used solar collectors considering all related aspects of solar energy 
studies. In fact, having this review paper, many researchers in the 
ﬁeld of solar energy can conduct their works with a comprehensive 
insight into the topic. It also provides researchers with the possi- 
bility of a more novel topic to conduct. As the use of nanoﬂuids in 
low to medium temperature solar collectors is a “state of the art”
technique to improve the overall performances, four widely inves- 
tigated collectors of Flat Plate Collector (FPC), Photovoltaic Thermal 
Collectors (PVT), Evacuated Tube Collectors (ETC) and Direct Ab- 
sorption Solar Collector (DASC) have been reviewed in this work. 
First,  various  mathematical  models  and  the  main  physical  phe- 
nomena affecting the heat transfer rate and signiﬁcance of various 
forces in the nanoﬂuid ﬂows have been reviewed. Moreover, the 
theoretical and mathematical modeling of nanoﬂuid’s thermal and 
thermophysical properties, which affect the heat transfer behavior 
of such working ﬂuids, have been discussed in detail. This includes 
the methods used to solve the governing equations and the suit- 

ability  of  the  existing  models.  Followed  by  the  ﬁrst  and  second 
thermodynamics laws, the principles of energy and exergy evalu- 
ating of four solar collectors have been brought and argued. After- 
ward, an in-depth discussion on the four types of solar collectors, 
including historical development, their operating principles, and a 
wide-ranged review of the literature, has been presented. Then, the 
impact of using nanoﬂuids on each kind of collectors’ overall and 
exergy eﬃciencies has been discussed and collected from the liter- 
ature. Followed by the entropy, economic and environmental anal- 
yses of the nanoﬂuid based solar collectors have been presented in 
depth. Also, a state-of-the-art review on energy, exergy, economic, 
and environmental effects of solar collectors in buildings as essen- 
tial applications of using solar energy has been introduced and dis- 
cussed. Challenges and the future scope of this ﬁeld of study have 
also been provided at the end of this paper showing the unsolved 
or un-worked prospects of using nanoﬂuids in solar collectors, and 
their actual applicability has been analyzed, while the various con- 
clusion remarks of this work have also been presented. This work’s 
novelty regards the multilateral investigation of the nanoﬂuid-solar 
systems from various points of view to provide a spherical presen- 
tation of this technology. 

3. Fundamentals and theory 

In this part below, numerous numerical models and the princi- 
pal physical phenomena affecting the nanoﬂuid heat transfer rate 
have  been  discussed.  More  speciﬁcally,  the  importance  of  differ- 
ent forces (shown in Fig. 2 ) in nanoﬂuid ﬂows that exist in par- 
ticulate ﬂows such as drag, lift (Magnus and Saffman), Brownian, 
thermophoretic,  Van  der  Waals,  electrostatic  double-layer  forces 
are considered and explained in detail in section 3 . Moreover, an 
overview of the thermophysical properties, physical models, heat 
transfer models, and evaluation criteria of nanoﬂuids are included. 
Followed  by  the  ﬁrst  and  second  laws  of  thermodynamics,  the 
principles of energy and exergy evaluating the four investigated so- 
lar collectors, details of which are discussed and explained. 

3.1. Nanoparticle motion dynamics in liquid 

In order to describe the processes of heat transfer in nanoﬂu- 
ids ﬂows, it is vital to know the dynamics of the nanoparticles in 
the base ﬂuid. When the particles are suspended in the base ﬂuid, 
many forces acting on these particles, however, due to the smaller 
size of the nanoparticles, only a fraction of these forces are impor- 
tant to the nanoparticles suspended in the base ﬂuid. These forces 
are induced by i) the base ﬂuid, ii) solid surfaces and surround- 
ing  walls,  iii)  other  nanoparticles,  iv)  electric  ﬁelds  or  external 
magnetic ﬁelds, and v) acoustic ﬁeld. Fig. 2 , shows the suspended 
nanoparticle in a ﬂuid acted by forces by numerous sources. Sec- 
tions below discuss the foremost contributing forces on the sus- 
pended nanoparticles in the base ﬂuid. 

3.2. Forces on the nanoparticles in the baseﬂuid 

The  present  section  is  devoted  to  presenting the  main  forces 
that can be found in the nanoparticle analysis when they ﬂow in- 
side the base ﬂuid. More speciﬁcally, forces such as drag, lift, Brow- 
nian, thermophoretic and unsteady forces are analyzed.

because of the nanoparticles’ ultra-ﬁne size. Therefore, Eq. (1) can 
be presented as below: 

d =

R e p 

f 

(2) 

Where, F D , C D ,V s and A are the force magnitude, drag coeﬃcient, 
slip velocity magnitude, and cross-sectional area of the nanoparti- 
cle. If ( f = 1) is used in Eq. (2) , then the original Strokes equations 
are recovered. The coeﬃcient of inertia ( C I ) also depends on the 
Reynolds number of particles. For Re p ( Re p < 1 ), C I = 1. 

The parameter Re p is the Reynolds of nanoparticle deﬁned as: 

R e p = 

ρ

f V s d p 
μ

f 

(3) 

For the transition regime of the Re p in the range of 1-800, the 

corrected inertial coeﬃcient is [99] : 

0 . 687 
C I = 1 + 0 . 15 R e p 
p 

(4) 

Higher values of Re p are not expected to happen for nanoﬂuids 
ﬂows. A good agreement was achieved in the experimental data 
and Eq. (4) [100] . Sekrani et al. [101] used Eq. (3) for estimating 
the slip velocity magnitude for their experiments, for the laminar 
range of Re p (10 0-160 0) in a 2D channel. 

Cunningham relation [102] estimates the slip correction coeﬃ- 
cient, for a small Knudsen number (ratio of the mean free path of 
λ
the baseﬂuid molecules to the diameter of the particle, K n = 
d p ) 
as: 

C c = 

1 
1 + 3 . 26 K n 

(5) 

When the Knudsen number exceeds 0.01, the slip corrections 
become signiﬁcant. Particle slip comparative to ﬂuid (gas) may be 
extremely critical. For nanoparticles suspended in liquid baseﬂuid, 
the slip effect on the drag because of the small values of a mean 
free  path  is  generally  not  very  signiﬁcant.  When  ﬂuidized  beds 
and ﬂowing through these packed beds are considered, then the 
crowding effect by the ﬂuid particles becomes signiﬁcant. 

3.2.1.1. Wall effect on the drag coeﬃcient.

face at a lower Reynolds number, then the drag coeﬃcient is

3.2.2. Lift Force 

Lift force consisting of two forces known as Saffman and Mag- 
nus independent lift forces that act on a moving nanoparticle in a 
liquid. When a nanoparticle is moving in a shear ﬂow, with both 
nanoparticle and the ﬂuid moving in the same direction (consider 
it  in  the  x-direction).  When  the  particle  moving  along  with  the 
ﬂuid  elements  experiences  a  shear-induced  force,  this  is  known 
as Saffman force, that is expressed as follows ( in the y-direction) 
[ 104 , 105 ]:

Where G represents the rate of ﬂuid shear. 
A circulating particle experiences an aerodynamic lift force in a 
moving ﬂuid, known as the Magnus effect, which was ﬁrst inves- 
tigated by Rubinow and Keller [106] . The rotation of the particle 
could be a result of a collision between the particles or could be 
the collision between the wall surface and the particle. Therefore, 
the Magnus force is the force in the y-direction, when the moving 
ﬂuid ﬂow is in the x-direction, with the rotational particle velocity 
represented by (cid:19)k , where k represents a basic unit vector in the 
z-direction.

An  asymptotic analysis was employed by Saffman, to express 
the total lift force that acts on a particle under a shear ﬂow as the 
combination of the two forces, which is expressed as:

Comparing the scale of life force to drag force, Marshall and Li 
[107] carried out a scaling analysis to compare the lift force to the 
drag force. The ratio of the Saffman lift to the ﬂuid drag differs in 

1 
/ 2 
G  , and Magnus lift to ﬂuid drag force ratio varies 

proportion to Re 
in fraction to Re G , expressed as:

V οrtex ﬂow ﬁelds are the main applications where the inertial 
pressure gradient force performs, where particles lighter than the 
adjoining ﬂuid-like gas bubbles are drawn into the vortex core by 
gradient force. 

3.2.3.2. Mass force added.  The force required to accelerate a parti- 
cle in a liquid is larger than the force required to accelerate similar 
particles in a vacuum, this is due to the acceleration that is needed 
for the ﬂuid elements which are in continuous motion by particle. 
Therefore, the moment of a particle in a vacuum in an inviscid ﬂow 
requires a lower additional force than the moment of a particle in 
a ﬂuid. The additional force required for the moment of the parti- 
cle in a ﬂuid is known as the added mass force or the virtual mass 
force, and is presented as below [107] :

D V 
f 
Dt  is the ﬂuid material derivative. Eq. (9) (by adding mass force) 
has  been  computed  for  inviscid  ﬂows,  and  at  the  same  time,  it 
has also been shown accuracy for different Re numbers for viscous 
ﬂow. 

3.2.3.3. Unsteady drag force.  The unsteady force of a particle sus- 
pending  in  a  viscous  ﬂow  due  to  velocity  change  is  known  as 
Boussinesq-Basset history or unsteady drag force. In vortex ﬂow, 
this force affects particle drift rates considerably. It is presented by 
the following expression [107] :

much greater than Magnus force for a nanoﬂuid ﬂow.

3.2.3.4. Unsteady  ﬂows  force  scales.  The  magnitude  of  inertial 
pressure  gradient  force  and  added  mass  forces  presented  by 
Eq.  (9)  concerning  particle  inertia  which  is  proportional  to  den- 
sity ratio ( ρ
) follows a similar scaling relationship. Therefore, 
for particles with lower density, the signiﬁcance of two forces be- 
comes more prominent. The signiﬁcance of pressure gradient and 
added  mass  force  for  different  nanoparticles  such  as  Cu,  Al 
3 , 
2 O

densities,  with  base  ﬂuids  includes  ethylene  glycol  (EG),  water 
and oil with densities of 1100, 1000, 900 kg/m 3 , respectively are 
presented  [108] .  Nanoﬂuid  Cu/oil  shows  the  lowest  value  of  0.1, 
while CNTs/EG shows the highest value of 0.81. Therefore, for the 
CNTs/EG nanoﬂuid, the two forces are not insigniﬁcant compared 

2 , SiO

to  particle  inertia.  Therefore,  the  ratio  of  Basset  history  force  to 
the ﬂuid drag force is written as follows [107] :

Because of the ﬁne size of the nanoparticles, the Basset history

3.2.4. Brownian Force 

In 1827, the random motion of particles in water was observed 
under a microscope which was due to the collisions between the 
pollen plants particles with water by Brown, who was a botanist 
[109] . Another name given to Brownian motion is pedesis, which 
is described as the collisions between the solid particles and ﬂuid 
molecules because of the random motion of these solid particles. 
The signiﬁcant improvement in heat and mass transfer in nanoﬂu- 
ids is due to the micro-convection and mechanical agitation of the 
nanoparticles in the base ﬂuid, which are convinced by the Brow- 
nian motion, which is a time-dependent force. The components of 
the  Brownian  force  were  simulating  as  a  white  noise  procedure 
with zero mean and ﬁnite variance and are presented by the fol- 
lowing equation [110]

In  other  studies,  Einstein  and  Smoluchowski  [ 107 , 111 , 112 ] 
showed that  after  a  period of  a  speciﬁed time  (t) being passed, 
where  t (cid:7) m p 
,  where  for  the  case  of  the  nanoparticles,  it 
3 π d p μ
could be a hundredth second, particles move from a zone of higher 
concentration of particles to a zone of low concentration of parti- 
cles via Brownian motion. The diffusion coeﬃcient for the particles 
can be written, as shown below if the concentration ∅ is expected 
to function in space and time. 
∂∅ 
∂t 

= D B ∇ 2 ∅ 
Where, D B is the Brownian diffusion coeﬃcient ( m 2 

s  ) and is pre- 

(11c) 

sented by the Stokes-Einstein relation below [113] : 

D B = 

κB T C c 
3 π μ
f d p 

The size of the particles can be identiﬁed by measuring the D B 

experimentally using the dynamic light scattering. 

Therefore,  Eq.  (11a)  for  Brownian  force  can  be  rewritten  in 

(cid:15) 

terms of D B as: 

F Bi

(11e) 

The  heat  transfer  rate  is  affected  by  the  Brownian  force  per 
unit mass magnitude. The diffusion coeﬃcient and the Brownian 
force per unit mass increases with the temperature increase and 
decrease in the size of the particles. 

3.2.5. Thermophoretic force 

In nanoﬂuids, the thermophoretic force, which is also known 
as thermomigration, is actually a drag force that results from the 
asymmetry interaction of the particle due to temperature gradient 
which is imposed by the Brownian motion) results on moving the 
particles from a hot region of high temperature to a cold region of

phenomenon of the migration of the particles schematically. 

Up to date, all the reported studies have investigated the gas- 
solid suspensions, but very few investigations have been reported 
on  solid-liquid  suspensions  such  as  nanoﬂuids.  Below  the  three 
models mostly used for solid-gas mixtures have been presented, 
which are also sometimes used for solid-liquid suspensions. The 
ﬁrst reported a study that developed the relationship of the parti- 
cle velocity and the thermophoretic force for a solid-gas mixture, 
taking  into  account  the  continuum  conditions  that  were  carried 
out by Epstein [115] . The following relationship was derived in the 
reported study:

and the ﬂuid temperature gradient represented by (cid:7)T , the thermal 
conductivities of the ﬂuid and particle are k 
f and k p , respectively. 
To obtain the steady thermophoretic velocity, Epstein [115] used 
the following relationship according to Stoke’s law, where Epstein 
assumed  that  the  drag  force  is  balanced  by  the  thermophoretic 
force which is the sole resistance:

Where,  d

nanoﬂuids, in the reported study [119] . Eq. (12g) has been derived 
from  presenting  the  thermophoretic  force  for  the  solid-gas  mix- 
tures; however, Michaelides [119] argued that the thermophoretic 
force  for  solid-liquid suspensions should  be  different due  to  the 
following points: 

a) For the continuum assumption to be valid, the Knudsen num- 
ber should be low for a solid-liquid mixture. Subsequently, the 
nanoparticle sizes are small compared to the gases that are sus- 
pended in the liquid due to the mean free path which is much 
smaller for liquids than for gas molecules ( 

(cid:7) 10 ). 

λ
air 
λwater 

b) The trend for the viscosity of gases is opposite to that of the 
liquids with the increase in temperature. With the increase in 
temperature, the viscosity of gases increases, while for liquids, 
it decreases. 

The primary dominant inertia and drag forces higher compared to 
the secondary forces. For the ﬂuid forces relative scale on the sus- 
pended nanoparticles, as  discussed earlier,  the  lift force  and the 
Basset history force are unimportant due to the small particle sizes 
in the nanoﬂuids. From a small Re number of the particle, the in- 
ertial correction of the drag force can be absent. Furthermore, the 
density of the nanoparticles can be assumed to be of similar mag- 
nitude as of the surrounding ﬂuid, in order to have the added mass 
force and the pressure gradient force are of similar magnitude as 
that of the particle inertia, which results in lumping these forces 
with inertia for ease. Therefore, the main two forces that are of 
particular attention for the nanoparticle ﬂows and have a prospec- 
tive for moving particle inertia to balance the drag force are the 
Brownian force and thermophoretic force, which are presented be- 
low. 

The particle Peclet number, Pe p  shows the signiﬁcance of the 
Brownian force in comparison to that of the particle inertia and is 
given by 

P e p = 

V s d p 
D B 

(13a) 

Where the particle slip velocity is V s = | V p − V 

f |, the particle di- 
ameter is d p and the Brownian diffusion coeﬃcient is D B which is 
given by Eq. (11d) . Brownian force to particle inertia ratio is given 
in [107] : 
(cid:2)

(13b) 

Therefore, the Brownian force is signiﬁcant for Pe p  (cid:3) O (1). V s 
represents  the  product  of  Stokes  number  St  and  the  ﬂuid  free 
stream velocity U. The St is given by the following equation: 

= 

St = 

τp 
τ
f 
Where ( τ

f = L / U ) . L is the characteristic ﬂuid length scale. For 
the slip velocity using the estimate V s = O ( StU ), the Pe p can be writ- 
ten as: 
P e p = O ( StU ) d p / D B 

(13d) 

(13c) 

If we equate the ratio of force to the thermophoretic drift ve- 
locity  magnitude  V T  ratio  to  the  inertial  slip  velocity  magnitude 
V s = O ( StU ), then the consequence of the thermophoretic force as

3.2.6. Scaling Analysis 

Marshall and Li [107] reported the scaling investigation for the 
micrometer particulate ﬂows, and Buongiorno [120] and Savithiri 
et al. [121] reported the scaling analysis for the nanoﬂuids. Partic- 
ulate ﬂows the particle motion for a micrometer scale in a ﬂuid 
is primarily controlled by the balance between the ﬂuid drag and 
particle inertia without collision, gravitational, and magnetic or ex- 
ternal  electric  ﬁelds.  To  scale  analysis,  other  forces  such  as  the 
added mass force or inertial pressure gradient force, usually hav- 
ing identical magnitude as that of the inertial particle for the ﬂuid 
are normally taken by inertia. In a non-negligible way, the resul- 
tant forces such as the Saffman and Magnus lift , Bassett history, 
and Brownian force, etc., in addition to inertia and drag can inﬂu- 
ence the motion of the particle; however, these secondary forces 
are small compared to the dominant inertia and drag forces. 

In the scaling analysis of nanoﬂuids with nanometer particulate 
ﬂows, the primary force is the ﬂuid drag force which is of signif- 
icant importance; however, the inertia force decreases adequately 
fast with the size of the particle that other forces might develop 
the same, higher or order of magnitude similar to that of inertia. 

f = ρ

f UL / μ

Where for ambient ﬂow the Reynolds number is R e 

. 
f 
Eq. (13e) is obtained using the constant values of A and B reported 
in ref. [119] , which shows that B = O (1) but ﬂuctuates in magnitude 
from O (1) to O (10 4 ) for various nanoﬂuids. As reported in the lit- 
erature and some examples presented in Ref. [120] and [121] , it 
can  be  concluded  by  Brownian  force,  and  thermophoretic  forces 
are more signiﬁcant than the particle inertia. The balance between 
them depends totally on the problem details and the material be- 
ing employed. Ref. [120] and [121] can be used to see examples 
related to scaling analysis.

Where φ is the volume fraction of the nanoparticles, m p  and 
ρπ are the mass and density of the nanoparticles, while m 
f and 
ρ
f are the mass and density of the base ﬂuid. Due to the heteroge- 
neous of the nanoﬂuid due to the agglomeration, and segregation 
of the nanoparticles in the ﬂuid, sometimes the nanoﬂuid contains 
both dilute and dense regions in the same nanoﬂuid. When the 
volume fraction of the nanoparticles is less than 0.1%, it is con- 
sidered as dilute ones (no collision occurs between the nanopar- 
ticles and that mainly due to the long distance between the par- 
ticles). The distance between the nanoparticles is another method 
for determining the nanoﬂuid status, i.e., dilute or dense. At higher 
concentrations, so nanoparticles, the nanoﬂuid is considered as a 
dense one, and in this case, forces formed between the nanoparti- 
cles and cannot be ignored. In the dense nanoﬂuid, the dominant 
forces between particles are collision forces when the volume frac- 
tion of the nanoparticles is less than 10%, while the contact be- 
tween the nanoparticles is dominant at a higher fraction of more 
than 10% [122] . 

The  relationship  between  the  distance  between  nanoparticles 
and  the  volume  fraction  (assuming  spherical  morphology  of  the 
nanoparticles with the same diameter of d p ) is as follow [122] : 

1 
/ 3 
= ( π / 6 ϕ ) 

l p 
d p 

(14b) 

Where l p  is the distance between two nanoparticles and φ is 
the volume fraction. When the distance between the nanoparticles 
is signiﬁcant, the possibility of the collision of the nanoparticles 
with each other is minimal, and thus the nanoﬂuid can be consid- 
ered as dilute and vice versa. 

Based  on  this  equation,  the  nanoﬂuid  is  considered  to  dilute 
when the ratio of the distance between the nanoparticles to their 
diameter (l p /d p ) is more than 8, as can be seen in Fig. 4 a. Fig. 4 b, 
c, and d show the different conditions of the nanoﬂuid, i.e., dilute 
when φ is less than 0.1, ( Fig. 4 b), dense collision when φ is be- 
tween 0.1 and 10 ( Fig. 4 c), and dense with a contact in case of φ
is higher than 10 ( Fig. 4 d). 

3.2.7.2. Van  der  Waals  Force.  The  Van  der  Waals  forces  between 
the particles (assuming spherical ones) of the same materials can

brid nanoﬂuid) in a ﬂuid that has a Hamaker constant of A

Van der Waals forces between the two different particles in the 
nanoﬂuid can be calculated using Eq. (3) , with the Hamaker con- 
stant A

Van der Waals forces are the attractive forces that are formed 
between  small  particles  or  molecules  that  can  be  formed  in  a 
wide range of distance between the molecules from less than 0.2 
nm to more than 10 nm [123 , 124] . Van der Waals forces consist 
of  three  different  interaction  forces  between  the  molecules,  i.e., 
dipole-dipole (Keesom force), dipole-induced dipole (Debye force), 
and dispersion (London force) [125] . 

3.2.7.3. Electrostatic double-layer force.  The ions form an electrical 
double layer (E 
dl ) using the electrolyte that surrounds the nanopar- 
ticles (charged) in the base ﬂuid. The induced potential of this dou- 
ble layer (E 
Edl ) can be calculated using the Hogg-Healy-Fuerstenau 
formula [126] (this formula is good when the surface potential of 
the nanoparticles is less than 60 mV):

thus they tend to decrease the agglomeration of the nanoparticles 
in contrary to the Wander Waals forces that tend to agglomerate 
the nanoparticles [125] .

3.2.7.4. Other  interparticle  forces.  Steric,  capillary,  hydration,  and 
solvation forces. Each one of them has its own effect on the sta- 
bility of the nanoﬂuid. Steric forces lead to an increase in the sta- 
bility of the nanoﬂuid, where it acts as repulsion forces between 
the nanoparticles similar to that of the electric double layer forces 
[125] . 

3.2.7.5. DLVO theory and stability of nanoﬂuids.  DLVO is a quantita- 
tive theory that used to describe the degree of the stability of the 
nanoﬂuids using the effect of two forces of opposite effects such as 
the Van der Waals forces (agglomeration effect and thus low sta- 
bility) and electric double layer (repulsive effect and thus higher 
stability) [124] . 

As can be seen in Fig. 5 , at the primary point, the attraction 
forces (agglomeration effect of Van der Waals forces) is high; thus, 
ﬂoccus are formed, and the nanoﬂuid is not stable; at the energy 
barrier contact, the nanoﬂuid is stable where the repulsion forces 
are high, and, the agglomeration forces are smaller than the repul- 
sion forces at the second-lowest point, and thus weak ﬂoccus are 
formed. 

3.2.8. External Forces 
3.2.8.1. Reduced gravity force.  Reduced gravity force is the change 
in the acceleration of gravity acting on ﬂuid with different density 
in contact, as a result of buoyancy forces [127] , in general form, it 
can be expressed as

Where V p  is the volume of nanoparticle ( m 3 ). Gravity force is 
proportional to the volume of the particle, and the relative den- 
sity of nanoparticle and base ﬂuid. Buongiorno, [128] evaluated the 
time taken by nanoparticles of a size 100nm to diffuse a length 
equal to its diameter under the effect of the transport mechanism. 
It  is  found  nanoparticles  take  ∼ 3 x 10 −7 s  for  turbulent  transport, 
∼ 0 . 002 s for Brownian diffusion, ∼ 0 . 05 s for thermophoresis, and 
6 s  for  gravity.  This  showed  that  the  turbulent  eddies  carry  the 
nanoparticles, and other diffusion mechanisms are negligible [128] . 

3.2.8.2. Lorentz  force.  The  movement  of  the  conductive  ﬂuid-like 
nanoﬂuid subject to electromagnetic forces is known by Magneto- 
hydrodynamic (MHD). The output of electric and magnetic ﬁeld in- 
teraction is electromagnetic forces [130] . Lorentz force is the driv- 
ing  force  in  the  electromagnets  ﬁeld;  it  is  the  total  force  on  a 
charged particle q moving through a region, containing both elec- 
tric and magnetic ﬁelds, it is given by [131] : 

F Lz = q ( E + ( V · B ) ) 

(16a) 

Where F Lz is Lorentz force, E is the electric ﬁeld, V the velocity 
of the charged particle, and B is a magnetic ﬁeld. The MHD effects 
were investigated in ﬂuid ﬂow and free convection ﬂow of nanoﬂu- 
ids. Increasing the heat transfer reduces the Hartmann’s number 
and Rayleigh number [ 132 , 133 ]. In the presence of the Magnetic 
ﬁeld,  the  velocity  of  squeezed  nanoﬂuid  decreases.  Whereas  the 
temperature and concentration increased [ 134 , 135 ]. Using nanopar- 
ticles  in  a  ﬂuid  increases  the  thermal  conductivity  [109]  signiﬁ- 
cantly. By increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles enhances 
the Nusselt number [ 136 , 137 ]. For a forced convection nanoﬂuid, 
the coeﬃcient of skin friction directly proportional to the magnetic 
parameter, while it is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio 
parameter [138] . 

Lorentz force inﬂuences the magnitude of velocity as well as 
the temperature ﬁeld in the thermal equipment [139] . For MHD 
ﬂows, the ratio of electromagnetic force to the viscous force is de- 
ﬁned by a Hartmann number (Ha) [140] .

The  auditory  radiation  force  is  a  nonlinear  acoustic  pressure 
function for nanoﬂuids, the particle’s velocity, sound velocity, and 
density of ﬂuid [ 144 , 145 ]. Increasing the particle volume will lead 
to an increase in the acoustic radiation force. However, the acous- 
tic radiation force increase can be minimal for a particle with small 
diameters [146] . 

3.3. Basic mathematical modeling of nanoﬂuids 

This section presents the necessary mathematical formulation 
of  the  most  critical  parameters  about  the  investigation  of  the 
nanoﬂuid-based  solar  collectors.  This  section  includes  the  ther- 
mophysical  properties  (density,  viscosity,  speciﬁc  heat,  thermal 
conductivity,  thermal  expansion,  and  surface  tension),  the  Nus- 
selt number, friction factor, pumping power, and pressure drop of 
nanoﬂuids. 

3.3.1. An overview of the thermophysical properties of nanoﬂuids 

Considerable  investigations  have  been  dedicated  to  advancing 
working ﬂuid to capitalize heat ﬂux removal from hydraulic sys- 
tems for several years. Solid metals show excellent thermal con- 
ductivity  as  compared  to  conventional  ﬂuids.  Maxwell  [147]  in- 
troduced  the  idea  by  dispersing  solid  particles  in  the  base  ﬂuid 
to enhance effective thermal conductivity and other heat transfer 
properties. Afterward, Hamilton and Crosser [148] , Davis [149] , Yu 
and Choi [150] , Wasp and Kenny [151] investigated the Maxwell 
model  to  compute  effective  thermal  conductivity.  But  these  sus- 
pensions  result  in  critical  challenges  due  to  large  particles,  for 
instance, fouling and pressure drop in heat exchangers, clogging, 
corrosion  and  sedimentation.  Choi  [152]  introduced  the  solution 
of the problems associated with large-sized particles by develop- 
ing nanoscale particles ranges from 5 nm to 200 nm, known as 
“nanoﬂuids”. They emerged as an innovative solid-liquid compos- 
ite that possesses remarkable properties and offering potential ap- 
plications  such  as  cooling  reactors,  solar  water  heating,  chillers, 
and cooling systems. Investigations on thermophysical properties 
of nanoﬂuids have attracted researchers for experimental and theo- 
retical studies. Akilu et al. [153] and Vanaki et al. [154] studied the 
factors  affecting  thermophysical  properties  such  as  volume  con- 
centration, temperature, nanoparticle size, and Brownian motion. 
Several investigations have performed on predicting the theoreti- 
cal, empirical analysis model for effective thermal conductivity of 
nanoﬂuids  by  Jang  et  al.  [155] ,  Leong  et  al.  [156] ,  Pal  [157]  and 
Chon et al. [158] and many others. Therefore, theoretical and em- 
pirical  analyses  have  predicted  to  be  inaccurate,  as  observed  by 
Aybar et al. [159] . Experimental investigations were performed by 
many scholars and researchers to improve thermal conductivity by 
the inﬂuence of nanoparticle size and the type and noticed that 
the temperature has a minimal effect on thermal conductivity as 
compared to nanoparticle concentration [93] . Yu et al. [160] have 
presented a comprehensive review of the effective thermal conduc- 
tivity of nanoﬂuids.

Viscosity is one of the signiﬁcant ﬂuid properties used to de- 
termine pumping power, which is highly inﬂuenced by solid par- 
ticles in the ﬂuid, and the correct understanding of the viscosity 
behavior of nanoﬂuids is required to design heat exchangers and 
cooling systems. Many models predicted that viscosity depends on 
nanoparticle concentration. Einstein [161] proposed a linear anal- 
ysis  model  to  determine  viscosity  and  observed  linear  equation, 
but  his  model  was  conﬁned  to  dilute  suspensions  of  solid  and 
spherical-shaped particles, whereas this relationship is nonlinear. 
Afterward, many investigations simpliﬁed Einstein’s model for rea- 
sonable  particle  concentrations  [ 162 , 163 ].  Some  studies  revealed 
that conventional analysis miscalculates the dynamic viscosity at 
a  low  particle  concentration  [ 164 , 165 ].  Therefore,  these  analysis 
models depicted variations with less experimental data, which sig- 
niﬁcantly limits the performance. 

Compared to thermal conductivity and viscosity, very few stud- 
ies are reported on the speciﬁc heat and density of nanoﬂuids. Lit- 
erature shows that the speciﬁc heat of nanoﬂuids, can increase or 
decrease with respect to baseﬂuid. The property is dependent on 
the volume concentration and type of the nanoparticles as well as 
temperature, however, the dependency on temperature is contra- 
dicted by some reports [166] . Most of the researchers, use the clas- 
sical mixture density model, which is based on linear approaches 
for volume  fractions and  densities, in order  to  obtain a  conven- 
tional solid-liquid mixture, however, not many studies have taken 
into  account  the  nanolayer  (that  includes  that  equivalent  void 
thickness), that exists between the nanoparticles and the baseﬂuid 
[167] . In another study, the particle size distribution was used to 
examine the volume fraction of the clusters and the average diam- 
eter to calculate the density of the nanoﬂuids. The proposed model 
of effective density took into account the interfacial layer effects 
as well as the particle clustering compared to the commonly used 
fractal theory and should good agreement with the experimental 
data [168] . 

Thermophysical characteristics of nanoﬂuids have an essential 
role in evaluating the nanoﬂuids’ applicability, especially in the so- 
lar energy sector. Numerous formulas for predicting thermophysi- 
cal properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, density, and 
speciﬁc heat have been reported in the literature based on math- 
ematical models or ﬁtting correlations on the experimental data 
as discussed. Such characteristics of nanoﬂuids are deeply depen- 
dent on several parameters, including volume concentration, bulk 
temperature, size, type and geometry of nanoparticles, and even 
the  nature  of  nanoﬂuids,  which  affects  the  Brownian  motion  of 
nanoparticles. Furthermore, the most reliable formulas seem to be 
the experiment-derived correlations, as all the possible parameters 
are considered in the experimental data. Additionally, as a draw- 
back of experimental correlations, they are almost dependent on 
just one or, in some cases, two types of nanoﬂuids and may not 
be applicable in other types of nanoﬂuids. In this review work, the 
authors try to present the most reliable experiments-derived cor- 
relations and the recently reported mathematical models for pre- 
dicting nanoﬂuids’ thermophysical properties. 

3.3.1.1. Density.  The density of the nanoﬂuid can be calculated ac- 
cording to Eq. (1) , which is an acceptable model by the scientiﬁc 
community. This model considers the volumetric concentration of 
the nanoparticle ( ϕ), the nanoparticle density, and the base ﬂuid 
density. The temperature’s impact is not direct in this model, but 
it exists through the temperature inﬂuence in the density of the 
base ﬂuid and the nanoparticle.

3.3.1.2. Viscosity.  Due to nanoﬂuids’ wide applications in thermal 
systems, dynamic viscosity is critical to be measured or calculated 

13 

because it is directly involved in pumping power and friction fac- 
tor.  Thus,  numerous  studies,  including  experimental  and  simula- 
tion, have been carried out on the viscosity of nanoﬂuids and their 
effecting  parameters,  including  nanoparticles  characteristics  (e.g., 
shape, type, size, concentration, Brownian motion, sedimentation 
types, …), and working temperature [169-173] . So, there is a great 
variety of models in order to estimate the dynamic viscosity of the 
nanoﬂuids. 

The ﬁrst model for the viscosity of nanoﬂuids is Einstein’s equa- 
tion that is presented as Eq. (18) . Although it can predict the vis- 
cosity of some of the nanoﬂuids, especially water-based, it is not 
that much accurate as it contains only volume concentration. How- 
ever, the temperature seems to be considered in the model as it 
is  inherently  in  μ
bf .  But  no  reliable  prediction  can  be  obtained 
for other non-water-based nanoﬂuids. Although it is conditioned 
by hard-sphere particle shape, and volume concentration less than 
2%, no further parameters such as type, shape, size, and motion of 
nanoparticles are included in the equation, making the model non 
100% reliable.

In  developing  more  accurate  models  for  viscosity,  Masoumi 
et al. [169] considered the Brownian motion, working temperature,

ment between the model’s predicted values and experimental data 
for CuO, TiO

Later,  Chevalier  et  al.  [170]  used  fractal  theory  to  develop  a 
model  as  Eq.  (20)  for  the  viscosity  of  aggregated  suspension  in 
higher shear rates. They used ς  as crowding factor and D 
f as the 
fractal dimension, which is 1.8 for aggregated nanoparticles.

In  a  progressing  way,  Chandrasekar  et  al.  [174]  developed  a 
theoretical  model  considering  the  composition  and  properties  of 
the  ﬂuid  phase,  the  speciﬁc  area,  density,  and  sphericity  of  the 
nanoparticles [173] as Eq. (21) .

Regarding the viscosity of nanoﬂuids, it should be asserted that 
Einstein’s equation has been modifying and several modiﬁed mod- 
els have been reported which can be used for predicting dynamic 
viscosity. Eq. (22) is the well-known Batchelor model (1977) [175] . 
Eq. (22) is a theoretical model which is an extended version of Ein- 
stein’s model, which can be used for higher nanoparticle concen- 
tration range and usually up to 4%.

concentrations.  Therefore,  developing  new  models  for  predicting

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100898 

nanoﬂuids’  viscosity  in  different  conditions  started  in  the  last 
decades, and numerous theoretical and experimental models have 
been developed till now. Table 1 shows viscosity models reported 
by different researchers for different types of nanoﬂuids. As it is 
evident from Table 1 , different parameters are involved in models. 
However, most of the models cannot be used for every single type 
of nanoﬂuids as they have been derived from small scale data set 
of viscosity, which obviously lead to models with limited outputs. 
This means that in order to have a widely applicable model for vis- 
cosity of nanoﬂuids, a big data set of measured viscosities in vari- 
ous conditions including nanoparticle type, shape, size, concentra- 
tion, temperature, type of base ﬂuid, hybrid or mono nanoparticles, 
or base ﬂuid, etc is required. It can also be a research direction for 
future works on the viscosity of nanoﬂuids. In fact, the reason be- 
hind many studies on the viscosity of nanoﬂuids is the lack of a 
widely used model for predicting the viscosity. For example, in this 
direction,  Aberoumand  et  al.  [176]  conducted  research  based  on 
this approach for the viscosity of oil-based nanoﬂuids. Their model 
Eq. (23) in predicting the viscosity of oil-based nanoﬂuids has a 
good agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, it should 
be a clear pathway for having one or several reliable models for 
any type of nanoﬂuids’ viscosity.

Table  1  provides  the  most  commonly  used  viscosity  models 
with the concluding remarks for each. There is an excellent vari- 
ety of suggested models that indicate increased nanoﬂuid viscosity 
compared to  the respective base ﬂuid.  Although  various correla- 
tions are available in the literature to estimate nanoﬂuids’ viscos- 
ity, the precision of these models is limited to a similar type of 
nanoﬂuid  and  operating  conditions.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to 
select a suitable model to determine nanoﬂuids’ viscosity with the 
minimum uncertainty concerning experimental data. In this direc- 
tion, the integration of machine learning approaches could improve 
the accuracy of these models [177] 

3.3.1.3. Speciﬁc heat capacity.  In the literature, there are two main 
formulas for estimating the speciﬁc heat capacity of the nanoﬂu- 
ids. Eq. (24) is a formula that uses the nanoparticle density and the 
baseﬂuid, while Eq. (25) is respective without the use of the den- 
sity. Both formulas have been used in the literature, but according 
to the comparative work of Khanafer and Vafai [202] , Eq. (24) is 
the most accurate one.

3.3.1.4. Thermal  conductivity.  Thermal  conductivity  enhancement 
of nanoﬂuids is known to be based on several criteria, including 1) 
the higher thermal conductivity of the nanomaterials suspended in 
the base ﬂuid, 2) the Brownian motion of the suspended nanopar- 
ticles, which comes from transferring of the momentum between 
the dispersed and stabilized nanoparticles and base ﬂuid, 3) the 
forces between the molecules of the base ﬂuid and the nanopar- 
ticles  which  led  to  creating  an  attraction  force,  and  4)  creation 
of highly conductive paths by the chain-shaped agglomeration of 
nanomaterials.  Therefore, many  models  and  correlations  for  pre- 
dicting the thermal conductivity of nanoﬂuids are available in the 
literature using one or several of the above-mentioned criteria. In 
fact, the thermal conductivity of nanoﬂuids depends on various pa- 
rameters,  including  bulk  temperature,  nanoparticle  types,  shape, 
size, concentration, stability, and Brownian motion, molecular in- 
teractions,  base  ﬂuid  type,  etc.  Since  the  lack  of  experimentally 

evidence on thermal conductivity and common disagreement be- 
tween  the  experiments  and  predicted  values,  there  is  an  argu- 
ment on the exact contributor criteria in thermal conductivity of 
nanoﬂuids  [203] .  Therefore,  similar  to  the  viscosity,  we  do  not 
have a general or widely used empirical-based model due to the 
lack of comprehensive research on the big data set of measured 
thermal conductivity. However, theoretical models have been used 
for various types of nanoﬂuids, mainly water, EG, or mixed. The 
ﬁrst model to foresee the thermal conductivity of solid-liquid sus- 
pensions with large particle size was proposed by Maxwell [204] . 
Maxwell  model  can  be  applied  in  the  cases  that  φ ≤ 1and  the 
effective thermal conductivity can be calculated through Eq. (26) . 
This is a very general model that can be used with various nanoﬂu- 
ids, but it has low accuracy.

Hamilton and Crosser [205] proposed a model to predict the ef- 
fective thermal conductivity of solid-liquid suspension, while their 
model was based on the shape of the utilized particles. If (k p /k

> 100, the mixture for the effective thermal conductivity can be 
computed through Eq. (27) :

Where  n  is  the  empirical  factor,  the  particle’s  shape  of 
n = 3/ ψ and ψ is the particle sphericity, deﬁned by the ratio of the 
surface area of a sphere with a volume equal to that of the parti- 
cle, to the surface area of the particle [202] . Eq. (27) is more gen- 
eral than Eq. (26) because it takes into consideration the shape of 
the nanoparticle. Several researchers tried to modify Maxwell or 
Hamilton–Crosser  models  considering  the  shape  of  nanoparticles 
and/or nano-layer effect. Just, for example, Yu and Choi [206] and 
[207] proposed two models as follows Eq. (28) , and Eq. (29) . The 
parameter ( β) is usually selected at values close to 0.1, which is a 
typical value. The nanoﬂuid thermal conductivity usually is called 
“effective” conductivity, and thus the symbol “k 
eff” is also used in 
the following expressions:

Eq. (28) is a very usual equation in the latest studies and it con-

over, Xuan et al. [32] , Jang and Choi [33] , and Chon et al. [34] fo- 
cused on the Brownian motion as a factor that affects the effec- 
tive thermal conductivity of nanoﬂuids. Various parameters such as 
random motion, particle size, concentration, temperature, a colli- 
sion between ﬂuid molecules, thermal diffusion of nanoparticles, a 
collision between nanoparticles due to Brownian motion, and ther- 
mal  interactions  of  dynamic  nanoparticles  with  ﬂuid  molecules, 
and Reynolds number and in the case of [208] , experimental data 
have been taken into account for developing models as Eqs. (30 -

This model is developed to predict better heat 
transfer enhancement with the experimental data. 
The model is well ﬁtted with the experimental data 
within ∼ 1 . 7% . It is strongly dependent on 
temperature. It is not a function of shear rate 
indicating Newtonian behavior of both EG and EG 
based nanoﬂuids. 
The calculated viscosities from the developed 
correlations and experimental values were observed 
within ±10% of their values. The viscosity is observed 
to be a function of temperature and volume 
concentration. 
This correlation is obtained by a least-square curve 
ﬁtting of experimental values for the nanoﬂuids. 
This model presents better agreement with the 
predictions of the traditional models for laminar ﬂow. 
These models are strongly dependent on temperature 
and volume concentration.

This correlation only depends on the volume fraction 
and shows better experimental representation and 
higher deviations, which is not always acceptable. 
- 
The model considers as the best ﬁt for data selected 
from empirical correlation with a 1.84% standard 
deviation. The nanoﬂuid dimensionless effective 
dynamic viscosity is proportional directly with the 
volume fraction and inversely proportional to the 
nanoparticle’s diameter. The nanoﬂuids dimensionless 
effective dynamic viscosity is independent of both the 
solid-liquid combination and the temperature for 
small volume fraction and room temperature. 
This expression is strongly related to volume 
concentration. It increases as the volume fraction 
increases resulting in the exponential increase. 
This correlation follows a logarithmic expression 
presented for viscosities of many liquids. It ﬁts well 
with the experimental data within ±8.4%. This 
nanoﬂuid exhibit non-Newtonian behavior at lower 
temperatures, and at a higher temperature, it exhibits 
Newtonian behavior. 
This expression ﬁts the data with a correlation 
coeﬃcient R 2 > 0.99. The maximum deviation 
between the correlation and experimental data is 
within ±8.8%.

This correlation ﬁts well with the experimentally 
measured viscosity with the maximum deviation of 
< 2% and accurately describes the observed 
viscosity-temperature dependence. 
This correlation is a function of temperature and 
volume concentration. 
The nanoﬂuid showed Newtonian behavior over a 
shear rate range of 0.5 to 10 4 
Temperature and particle concentration signiﬁcantly 
affect the shear viscosity of the nanoﬂuids; however, 
the normalized shear viscosity concerning the 
viscosity of the base ﬂuid is independent of 
temperature. 
In the low-temperature range from − 35 to 0 °C, the 
nanoﬂuid had non-Newtonian Behaviors. Whereas, in 
high temperature from 0 to 90 °C, it showed 
Newtonian behaviors. 
Non- Newtonian in all volume concentration.

This model is proposed with a standard deviation of 
9.1%. 

The proposed models are reliable to compute the 
viscosity of Fe 3 O 4 based nanoﬂuids within a speciﬁc 
range of temperature and volume concentration. The 
magnetic nanoﬂuids can easily be used as heat 
transfer ﬂuids. 
This correlation shows good agreement with the 
experimental data. The viscosity of nanoﬂuids 
reduces with temperature and increases with 
increasing volume fraction. 
Non-Newtonian with speciﬁc values of A and B in 
each temperature. The viscosity is a strong function 
of temperature and volume concentration. The 
correlation is well-ﬁtted within ± 10% of the 
experimental values. 
Non- Newtonian for 1.5 and 2% volume fraction. 

The model is applied for laminar ﬂow. 
Signiﬁcant increases in wall shear stresses occurred 
as the volume fraction of nanoparticles increased.

It showed shear-thinning behavior at 10 vol.%. The 
viscosity increases with increasing volume 
concentration. 
This formula can be obtained using experimental 
values for investigating the viscosity of SWCNTs 
nanoﬂuids as a function of temperature at 0.1 wt.%. 
Investigation of theoretical analysis with 
experimental values represents a nonlinear 
relationship between SWCNTs concentration and 
viscosity and strongly temperature dependent. 
This model is developed to consider the shape effects 
(non-spherical shape) in dilute suspensions such as 
rod-like particles. The expression is valid for viscosity 
at a higher shear rate and volume concentration up 
to 1/r 2 
( ∼0.004% in volume). This expression could 
not predict MWCNT/H 2 O based nanoﬂuids’ viscosity 
for volume fraction, exceeding 0.027%. The difference 
between experimental and numerical data increases 
with the volume concentration, showing the strong 
impact of agglomeration, which increases the 
nanotubes’ effective volume and thus, the relative 
viscosity of the nanoﬂuid.

Table 2 below provides thermal conductivity models reported 
by different researchers for different nanoﬂuids in the literature. 
In  fact,  we  tried  to  collect  the  most  cited  models  for  the  ther- 
mal conductivity of nanoﬂuids and avoid the non-popular correla- 
tions. Therefore, the models are almost theoretically, but they can 
acceptably predict thermal conductivity for the respective studied 
nanoﬂuids only. 

The standard hypothesis based on nanoﬂuids for heat transfer 
principles has summarized in this section. Due to the discrepancy 
in nanoﬂuids’ experimental measurements, a crucial investigation 
of the mechanisms was required. In the past, the methods intro- 
duced for solid composites by Keblinski et al. [231] and Eapen et al. 
[232] indicated that the various spatial composition of nanoparti- 
cles could describe published experimental results. 

Nanoﬂuids have the ability of particles to drift within the mix- 
ture because of the ﬂuid behavior of their medium. Several mod- 
els for nanoﬂuids, including Brownian motion, is subjected even in 
the absence of wide-ranging hydrodynamic structures. This mech- 
anism  has  been  the  hypothetical  basis  of  most  of  the  published 
models  for  thermal  conductivity  of  nanoﬂuids.  Nanoparticles  are 
always hypothesized to have a low drift velocity (Rep < 0.01), and 
the heat transfer due to Brownian spatial displacement is insignif- 
icant [ 216 , 233 ]. The relative dynamics between particle and carrier 
ﬂuid correspond to the Stokes regime, which avoids the particles 
from emergent convective turbulent vortices. Brownian models de- 
scribe the underlying mechanism behind the thermal conductivity 
improvement is uncertain due to two factors: 

1 Inability  to  deﬁne  the  conductivity  improvement  from  ﬁrst 

principles as they always propose “empirical” factors. 

2 Lack of generality. Currently, they have only shown the ability 
to reproduce the data that is applied to ﬁt the empirical factors. 

Aggregation  occurs  in  solid  particle  suspensions;  a  theory 
based on agglomeration could be further investigated by studying 
the relationship between nanoﬂuids and agglomerates’ geometry 
[ 234 , 235 ]. The signiﬁcant reliable model based on agglomeration 
lies in the ability to relate the geometrical properties of aggregates 
with the mixture’s thermal conductivity. There remains a signiﬁ- 
cant challenge as it is impractical to obtain both measurements at 
the  same  time.  Aggregation  or  agglomeration is  a  complex  phe- 
nomenon for numerical analysis. The agglomeration characteristic 
has  a  numerical  distribution  based  on  several  physical  variables 
that are not usually reported in experimental studies [236] . 

Another  undertaking  challenge  is  to  validate  such  numeri- 
cal  techniques.  To  assist,  Prasher  et  al.  [237]  and  Michaelides 
[238] suggested including the zeta potential of particles, pH of the 
solution,  time  after  preparation,  temperature,  volume  concentra- 
tion, and shape and size of the particles when the thermal conduc- 
tivity measurements are described. To conclude, factors such as liq- 
uid layering improves thermal conductivity [239] . In other terms, 
it is more rational to exhaust the aggregation disagreement before 
seeking out novel physics. 

Also,  as  per  the  literature  where  the  popular  models  are  re- 
ported, it is expected that these models cannot predict the ther- 
mal conductivity of oil-based nanoﬂuids. The thermal conductiv- 
ity of oils is decreasing with increasing temperature; however, it is 

increasing for water or EG. Therefore, any general model for pre- 
dicting liquids and nano liquids’ thermal conductivity needs to be 
based  on  a  big  database,  including  various  types  of  base  ﬂuids, 
nanoparticles, and different conditions applied to them. This also 
would be a direction for future research, as the lack of a widely 
used model is still available in the literature. 

3.3.1.5. Thermal  expansion  coeﬃcient.  Thermal  coeﬃcient  expan- 
sion is deﬁned as the change in nanoﬂuid volume per one-degree 
Kelvin rise in the mixture temperature (1/K). Thermal coeﬃcient 
expansion  is  vital  for  natural  and  mixed  convection  problems. 
Thermal coeﬃcient expansion is presented as follows [142] : 

β
n f = 

( 1 − ϕ ) ( ρβ ) 

f + ϕ ( ρβ ) 
p 
n f 

ρ

(33) 

For the same relationship if the densities of the nanoparticle 
and the base ﬂuid are close enough, then this expression is ap- 
proximated as follows: 
n f =  ( 1 − ϕ ) β
β

f + ϕ βp 

(34) 

3.3.1.6. Surface tension.  Surface tensions are a measure of force per 
unit length (N/m), which is utilized due to the extension of the 
liquid’s surface to overcome the intermolecular forces. For analy- 
sis of the heat transfer phenomena, surface tension is a signiﬁcant 
factor; for example, pool boiling plays a vital role as it inﬂuences 
the surface wettability and bubble development [240] . The surface 
tension of nanoﬂuids graphene/water is reported [241] ; the results 
reported show that with the increase in nanoparticle concentra- 
tion and an increase in temperature, the surface tension decreases.

This model is valid for the concentration range from 0.05% to

was reported in another study [242] for graphene/water nanoﬂu- 
ids. While the opposite effect was presented for different baseﬂuid 
and nanoparticles in another study [243] . Later, a new correlation 
was developed considering the effect of nanoparticle size for four 
2  dis- 
different nanoparticles, which are Al 
persed in propylene glycol and water mixture (60:40) [149] . The

More studies have been reported recently [ 240 , 244 ] that have 
shown the importance of surface tension of nanoﬂuids for thermal 
engineering applications, by considering different factors such as 
temperature, dispersant, morphology, the nanoparticles concentra- 
tion, and types of base ﬂuids used, along with other correlations. 
Future studies are needed to consider different nanoparticles with 
different missing shapes in the literature, resulting in more accu- 
rate correlations to understand the surface tensions for nanoﬂuids 
better. 

3.3.1.7. Concluding  remarks  on  thermophysical  properties.  The  cur- 
rent review investigation presents a considerable understanding of 
the thermophysical properties of nanoﬂuids. Most investigated the- 
oretically and experimentally thermal properties for nanoﬂuids re- 
ported in the literature are thermal conductivity, viscosity, density,

that at a certain length of CNT for 
both models, the calculated values 
increases as the increase in interfacial

more sensitive to the diameter of CNT 
and layer thickness.

This expression is proposed to 
calculate the effective thermal 
conductivity for nanotubes within 
±15%. 

This model considering effects of 
nanoparticle size and shape, 
thickness, and thermal conductivity of 
the interfacial nanolayer, the ratio of 
thermal conductivity of 
the particle to the base ﬂuid shows 
good agreement with experimental 
values. The effective thermal 
conductivity improves with 
decreasing carbon nanotube outer 
diameter and increasing nanolayer 
thickness. 

This expression takes the effects of 
particle size, volume concentration, 
temperature dependence, and 
properties of base ﬂuid and particle 
phase. The Brownian motion effect 
was effective at higher temperatures 
as observed experimentally for 
spherical particles. 

For spherical particles. 

This correlation is for spherical 
particles. The experimental results are 
within the range predicted by 
effective medium theory. Factors like 
geometry, agglomerate state, and 
surface resistance of nanoparticles 
control thermal conductivity 
improvement in nanoﬂuids. 
This correlation ﬁts perfectly with the 
experimental results. The thermal 
conductivity increases with the ratio 
of nanoparticles thermal conductivity 
to that of the base ﬂuid due to 
Brownian motion. 
This equation is for spherical particles 
used to estimate the effective thermal 
conductivity by considering the effect 
of the interfacial layer at the

and speciﬁc heat for several important thermal applications such 
as  heat  exchangers  and  solar  thermal  collectors,  etc.  It  is  found 
from  literature,  that  speciﬁc  heat  of  nanoﬂuids  is  dependent  on 
various  factors,  such  as  the  volume  fractions,  temperatures,  dif- 
ferent  types  and  sizes  of  nanoparticles,  dispersants  and  baseﬂu- 
ids.  Speciﬁc  heat  of  the  baseﬂuid  is  always  higher  compared  to 
the  base  ﬂuid.  Nanoﬂuid  density  increases  with  increase  in  vol- 
ume fraction and decreases with increase in temperature. Density 
of the baseﬂuid is lower than the nanoﬂuid. For calculating effec- 
tive density of nanoﬂuids, the effects of interfacial layer and parti- 
cle clustering must be considered for conventional mixture rule. 
Comparing  to  viscosity  and  thermal  conductivity  little  work  has 
been reported in literature for speciﬁc heat and density, which re- 
quires further investigation for  better  modeling and understand- 
ing. This review also presents the theoretical correlations to ana- 
lyze the properties of nanoﬂuids. Thermal conductivity is reported 
to be well-ﬁtted with a theoretical model, and some researchers 
reported that experimental data is over predicting when compared 

to the theoretical models. Properties like thermal conductivity and 
nanoﬂuids’ viscosity are affected by temperature, type of material, 
particle size and shape, and volume concentration. 

Nevertheless, the viscosity is not dependent on the particle ma- 
terial dispersed for lower concentration (below 4%) [233] . It was 
observed  from  the  experimental  investigations  that  the  viscosity 
of nanoﬂuids presented a Newtonian behavior for a concentration 
of less than 4%. The existing classical model neglected to estimate 
viscosity [165] and thermal conductivity [245-248] of nanoﬂuids. 
Researchers have developed a regression expression for nanoﬂuids 
based on the experimental data, but it does not provide the gen- 
eral expression valid for all nanoﬂuids. Thus, a general correlation 
should be developed in the near future for all kinds of nanoﬂuids. 
Another  critical  challenge  for  properties  is  time-dependence, 
which for viscosity and thermal conductivity of nanoﬂuids is ne- 
glected.  The  sustainable  and  dynamic  properties  of  nanoﬂuids 
are  of  great  importance  for  long-term  applications.  The  time-

mation and various nanoparticles collision. 

analyze the natural and mixed convection heat transfer in different 
closed enclosures [ 262 , 263 ]. 

The surfactants play an important role in the viscosity and ther- 
mal conductivity of nanoﬂuids. Most of the investigations are un- 
certain.  Most  researchers  observed  that  by  using  a  suitable  sur- 
factant, the nanoﬂuids show increased viscosity and reduction in 
thermal  conductivity.  Some  researchers  believed  that  surfactants 
positively impact thermal conductivity and insigniﬁcant impact on 
the viscosity and produce reduced drag. The main challenge lies 
in how to make better use of surfactants in nanoﬂuids for better 
performance. 

The  models  calculated  for  nanoﬂuids’  viscosity  and  thermal 
conductivity cannot predict for large-scale applications as it can- 
not consider the microscopic factors of nanoparticles such as clus- 
tering, collision, and charge distribution with better accuracy. The 
uncertainty of nanoﬂuids properties results in some critical chal- 
lenges in heat transfer applications since the viscosity, and ther- 
mal conductivity calculates the dimensionless parameters such as 
Nu, Re, and Pr numbers [ 249 ] but also have a signiﬁcant impact 
on  these  parameters  [250] .  Hybrid  nanoﬂuids  are  more  promis- 
ing than nanoﬂuids due to remarkable thermophysical properties 
such as thermal conductivity, viscosity, speciﬁc heat, and density. 
To conclude, the nanoﬂuids are the potential ﬂuids compared to 
the base ﬂuids. 

3.4. Nanoﬂuid heat transfer phenomenon 

Nanoﬂuids have been classiﬁed into three main categories, such 
as thermophysical properties, heat transfer analysis modeling, and 
applications.  There  are  two  methodologies,  namely  single-phase 
and two-phase models, to numerically investigate nanoﬂuids con- 
vection  for  modeling  the  velocity  ﬁeld,  temperature  distribution, 
and heat transfer rate. In the Single-phase technique, also known 
as  the  homogeneous  model,  the  solid  particles  and  ﬂuid  are  in 
thermal equilibrium and is considered to be much straightforward 
and needs minimum computational type. Some studies by using 
the  single-phase  technique  numerically  examined  the  ﬂuid  ﬂow 
and  heat  transfer  properties  of  natural  and  forced  convection  of 
nanoﬂuids  in  square  cavities  and  observed  that  the  rate  of  heat 
transfer increases by increasing the Rayleigh number and nanopar- 
ticle volume concentration [251-253] . Wen and Ding [254] investi- 
gated convective heat transfer of a nanoﬂuid in a horizontal pipe 
and observed that the nanoparticles’ distribution within the chan- 
nel is non-uniform, which states that the slip velocity between the 
nanoparticles and ﬂuid may not be zero. 

The slip velocity has been ensured by various parameters like 
drag force, Brownian motion, gravity, and thermophoresis forces. 
Manninen  [255]  considered  two  signiﬁcant  slip  velocity  mecha- 
nisms  between  solid  and  ﬂuid  phases,  such  as  drag  and  grav- 
ity.  Several  researchers  have  conducted  numerical  investigations 
on  mixed  and  forced  convection  of  nanoﬂuids  with  various  ge- 
ometries and examined that the two-phase approach signiﬁes im- 
proved approximation as compared to the single-phase by observ- 
ing deposition of solid particles on the bottom surface of the enclo- 
sure indicating higher particle concentration on the bottom surface 
than the upper one [256-259] . Later, Brownian motion and ther- 
mophoresis  force  became  another  signiﬁcant  slip  velocity  mech- 
anism  with  the  progress  of  four  equations,  a  non-homogeneous 
equilibrium analysis transport model for convective transfer, and 
observed  a  non-uniform  distribution  indicating  that  nanoparticle 
travels from a hot region to the colder one [120] . The natural con- 
vection in a differentially heated cavity (DHC) by using a transport 
model has been investigated by Sheikhzadeh et al. [260] and Cor- 
cione  [261]  and  observed  a  remarkable  trend  with  experimental 
data. Several scholars and researchers have utilized this model to 

Therefore, when using nanoﬂuids to enhance the performance 
of  thermal  systems,  it  is  necessary  to  evaluate  the  thermo- 
hydraulic characteristics of such devices. This leads to the study of 
the conservation laws through various physical simulations to solve 
heat transfer and ﬂuid ﬂow phenomena. The evaluation of the fun- 
damental ﬁelds such as velocity, pressure, and temperature are the 
subject of the resolution of transport equations, including momen- 
tum, continuity, and energy equations. Although the leading equa- 
tions  are  similar  for  both  conventional  and  nanoﬂuid,  nanoﬂuid 
ﬂow modeling’s mathematical approaches can be quite different. 
Table 3 presents the heat transfer phenomenon of nanoﬂuids. 

According  to  the  literature  and  the  different  modeling  ap- 
proaches  adopted  in  the  evaluation  of  solar  collectors  using 
nanoﬂuids,  homogeneous  models  are  more  likely  preferred  for 
their  simplicity  and  lower  computational  time.  However,  two- 
phase ﬂow models are more suitable for an accurate and concise 
solution, considering the motion of nanoparticles within the base 
ﬂuid. Nevertheless, the later models are more complex and more 
time consuming and should be used when accuracy and dynamics 
of nanoparticles are required 

3.4.1. Heat transfer and ﬂuid ﬂow modeling 

The heat transfer phenomena inside the ﬂow are critical in the 
solar systems, and they are modeled by two critical parameters; 
the Nusselt number and the friction factor. The heat transfer rates 
are associated with the Nusselt number, while the pressure drop is 
depended on the friction factor values. 

3.4.1.1. Nusselt Number.  Evaluation of Nusselt number is the other 
important part of a simulation of heat transfer performance. The 
below equations ((43a) and (43b)) can be estimated to assess Nus- 
selt number in laminar and turbulent ﬂow regimes. However, other 
well-known equations can be utilized in different conditions and 
nanoﬂuid’s type of problems. Equation 43a is for laminar ﬂow (Re 
< 2300) with constant temperature level on the ﬂuid tube,  and 
equation  43b  regards  the  turbulent  ﬂow  regime.  These  formulas 
are selected to be presented because they are usually in the liter- 
ature about nanoﬂuids and especially in applications of nanoﬂuid- 
based solar systems. 

For laminar regime: 

Nu = 3 . 6 6 + 

0 . 00 67( D 

1 + 0 . 4 ( D 

L Re . Pr ) 
0 . 67 
L Re . Pr ) 

For turbulent regime: 
Nu = 0 . 023 · R e 0 . 8 · P r 0 . 4 

(43a) 

(43b) 

The  Nusselt  number  can  be  reported  as  a  function  of  the 
Reynolds number or of the Peclet number, which is another dimen- 
sionless parameter, and it is equal to the product (Re · Pr). Table 4 
includes various suggested equations about the Nusselt number in 
the literature. Every equation can be used in its proper region and 
for the respective nanoﬂuids. At this point, it has to be said that 
the  determination  of  formulas  about  the  Nusselt  number  about 
the nanoﬂuids is a diﬃcult task which is open in the literature, 
and there is a need for conducting more experimental studies to 
develop  global  formulas  which  can  be  valid  for  a  vast  range  of 
nanoﬂuids. 

3.4.1.2. Friction Factor.  About the friction number, typical formulas 
are reported below about the calculation of this parameter for lam- 
inar and turbulent ﬂow. Moreover, it has to be stated that there is 
a need for developing global formulas about the friction factor of a 
vast range of nanoﬂuids.

For  friction  factor  assessment,  the  equation  below  is  reliable 

and widely used for laminar ﬂow [37] : 

f = 

64 
Re 

(44a) 

In  the  turbulent  regime,  the  friction  factor  can  be  calculated 

through the Blasius equation [289] : 

f = 

0 . 316 
Re 0 . 25 

(44b) 

3.4.1.3. Pumping Power and Pressure Drop.  The pressure drop in the 
solar collector can be estimated by using the friction factor: 

(cid:21)
(cid:7)p = f 

L ρ

(cid:22)
n f V 2 
2 D 

(45) 

The pumping work demand for circulating the working ﬂuid in 

the solar collector can be calculated as: 
P p = VA (cid:7)p 

(46) 

Evaluating pumping power and pressure drop has always been 
a challenging parameter in nanoﬂuids applications in not only so- 
lar  systems  but  also  other  nanoﬂuids  applications  such  as  heat 
transfer  enhancement,  lubrication,  erosion,  and  desalination,  etc. 
This is because nanoﬂuids usually suffer from a lack of good sta- 
bility,  which  can  cause  the  nanoparticles  to  be  precipitated  into 
the  nanoﬂuid.  This  phenomenon  can  increase  the  pressure  drop 
and pumping power, which can make the applicability of nanoﬂuid 
challenging. In order to have an applicable nanoﬂuid, it is required 
to evaluate the pressure drop during the nanoﬂuid-based system 
operation. Moreover, since the usual base ﬂuid that is applied in 
solar  systems  is  water,  the  most  applicable  equations  from  as- 
sessing  the  pressure  drop  and  pumping  power  are  Eq.  (42)  and 
Eq.  (43),  both  of  which  are  derived  for  Newtonian  ﬂuids.  How- 
ever,  non-Newtonian  nanoﬂuids  may  also  be  used  in  particular 
cases that need to consider the rheometry and viscosity of Non- 
Newtonian ﬂuids. 

3.4.2. Evaluation criteria of nanoﬂuids 

There  is  a  need  for  using  evaluation  criteria  to  evaluate  the 
thermal eﬃciency improvement and the immediate increase in the 
pressure decline. The most usual evaluation criteria are the exergy 
eﬃciency and the overall eﬃciency, while the performance assess- 
ment standard is also used. 

The exergy eﬃciency index ( ηex ) is a thermodynamic criterion, 
and  it  is  based  on  the  maximum  network  manufacture  by  use- 
ful  heat  production.  This  criterion  is  used  to  convert  the  useful 
heat production ( Q u ) into the corresponded maximum work, and 
then the pumping work requirement ( W p ) is deducted. Bellos et al. 
[290] developed a model for calculating the exergy eﬃciency ηex 
with ( T sun ) = 5760 K, ( T o ) = 298.15 K reference temperature, which 
is given in Eq. (18) .

(cid:12)

The logistic mean ﬂuid temperature ( T m ) is computed as follow- 
ing Eq. (48) . Moreover, it should be noted that the sun is a radia- 
tion reservoir that does not heat. This is perfect for beam irradia- 
tion but is extensively analyzed for global irradiation. 

T m =

(48) 

The  next  index  is  the  overall  eﬃciency  index  ( ηovr ) 
Eq.  (49)  which  converts  the  pumping  work  demand  into  pri- 
mary energy, and then this quantity is subtracted from the useful 

29 

heat Wirz et al. [291] . 
Q u − W p / η
Q s 

ηov r = 

el 

(49) 

While η

el is the electrical eﬃciency value, usually is close to 33% 
[291] ,  and  it  is  deﬁned  as  the  grid  mean  electrical  eﬃciency  in 
the observed position. Overall, it can be noted that the exergy ef- 
ﬁciency is needed to assess the useful, promising work production 
for  solar  collectors,  while  the  overall  eﬃciency  index  is  used  to 
evaluate the useful primary energy production of the solar collec- 
tors. 

The ﬂow inside the solar collector can be estimated by the per- 
formance evaluation criterion (PEC) of Eq. (50) . This index evalu- 
ates the Nusselt number enhancement together with the friction 
factor increase, in comparison to the reference state “o” Hasanpour 
et al. [292] . 

P EC = 

( Nu/N u 0 ) 
1 / 3 
( f / f 0 ) 

(50) 

As an explanation, PEC is an index to assess the enhancement of 
convective heat transfer in the constant pumping power in several 
test cases, and in the cases that PEC values are higher than 1, the 
ﬂow is improved, and the observed means leads to improvement 
in overall performance. 

The  energy  analysis  of  solar  collectors  (Flat  plate,  evacuated 
tube,  PVT)  mainly  includes  the  calculation  for  electrical  or  ther- 
mal performance and optimizing values of the mass ﬂow rate or 
volume concentration of nanoparticles for ﬁnding the highest out- 
come for eﬃciency [ 293 , 294 ]. The ﬁrst law eﬃciency of thermo- 
dynamics (Energy eﬃciency) in the heat exchange system is very 
much restricted. Therefore, we usually go for the second eﬃciency- 
law  of  thermodynamics,  also  known  as  Exergy  eﬃciency,  which 
mainly includes entropy generation because the calculations made 
from second law eﬃciency are correct and reliable. In nearly every 
system, second law eﬃciency or exergy eﬃciency can be deﬁned 
as the proportion of actual thermal eﬃciency at similar conditions. 
Hence, the second law-based eﬃciency can be used to examine the 
irreversibility of the entropy generation rate. The purpose of en- 
tropy generation is also essential to improve the performance of 
the system because the available work of the system can be re- 
duced from the entropy generation [295-297] . 

Lastly, further discussion of the different criteria has great inter- 
est. The exergy eﬃciency evaluates the maximum possible electric- 
ity output of the collector, while the overall eﬃciency evaluates the 
maximum possible net heat production (or primary energy) that 
the collector can produce. These criteria both evaluate the pump- 
ing work demand of the pumping system, and they are similar but 
not the same. PEC is another criterion that is characterized as a 
ﬂow criterion. It takes into consideration the increase of the Nus- 
selt number and the increase of the friction factor, and it evaluates 
it accurately. Also, the entropy generation is a thermodynamic cri- 
terion and not an eﬃcient criterion. To conclude, the PEC and the 
entropy generation criteria can be used for the initial evaluation of 
the ﬂow and the thermodynamic process, while the exergy and the 
overall criteria are the most important because they take into con- 
sideration all the phenomena and mainly the performance of the 
examined device, the solar collector. 

3.5. Eﬃciency based on the 1st law of thermodynamics or Energy 
Analysis 

The ﬁrst-law analysis of solar collectors regards their thermal 
or energy eﬃciency. It shows useful heat production, and it is the 
most straightforward index that can be calculated. However, it is 
an essential index, and it has signiﬁcant importance for the collec- 
tor performance evaluation.

3.5.1. Flat Plate Collector 

The thermal (or energy) eﬃciency of the solar ﬂat plate collec- 
tor ( η
th ) is deﬁned as the ratio of the convenient heat absorbed 
to  the  entire  energy  input.  Arithmetically,  it  can  be  written  as 
Eq. (51) : 

module operating temperature, respectively. The thermal eﬃciency 
is expressed as the thermal power ratio extracted by the ﬂuid by 
the solar incident on the collector surface. The following correla- 
tion Eq. (59) deﬁnes it:

(59) 

The  solar  collector  working  capacity  is  explained  by  energy 
equilibrium equations, which show the scattering of incoming en- 
ergy from solar into convenient energy addition, optical losses, and 
thermal losses. The radiation from solar is engrossed by absorber 
collector S per unit area. Also, losses from the thermal energy from 
the collector to the atmosphere by all the heat transfer modes can 
be  symbolized  as  the  product  of  a  heat  transfer  coeﬃcient  ( U L ) 
times the  difference between the  mean absorber plate tempera- 
ture ( T pm ) and the ambient temperature ( T a ). In steady state the 
convenient collector output energy for the area A c is the difference 
between the absorbed solar radiation and the thermal loss: 
Q u = A c [ S − U L ( T m − T a ) ] 

(52) 

Equation (52) is an energy balance equation which calculates 
the available beneﬁcial energy absorbed by using the speciﬁc ab- 
sorbed solar energy ( S ) and the total heat loss coeﬃcient ( U L ) in 
W/m 2 K. The parameter ( S ) is usually calculated as below for ﬂat- 
plate technologies (e.g., FPC and ETC): 
S = ( τ α) · I T 

(53) 

The coeﬃcient of total heat loss ( U L ) can be estimated by rela- 

tion to Eq. (54) [298] : 
U L = U t + U 

b + U e 

(54) 

The various thermal loss coeﬃcients ( U ) are calculated accord- 
ing to the literature [299] by using the proper equations for the 
FPC. The ( U t ) is the top thermal loss coeﬃcient, ( U 
b ) is the back 
thermal loss coeﬃcient and the ( U e ) is the edge thermal loss coef- 
ﬁcient 

Moreover, by introducing the heat removal factor ( F R ), it can be

3.5.3. Evacuated Tube type System 

The  energy  balance  equations  governing  the  thermal  perfor- 
mance of evacuated tube systems are like that of ﬂat-plate collec- 
tors, with the main difference being that the convective heat trans- 
fer  between  the  absorber  and  the  glass  envelope  is  eliminated. 
Based on the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, the thermal eﬃciency 
of the evacuated tube can be expressed as Eq. (61) :

Eq. (62) : 
Q u =  ˙ m C p ( T o − T i ) 

(62) 

Where ( ˙ m ), ( C p ), ( T 

i ), ( T o ) are the mass ﬂow rate, speciﬁc heat, 
ﬂuid inlet temperature, and ﬂuid outlet temperature, respectively. 
The thermal eﬃciency can be also be evaluated by calculating 

the thermal losses, as shown in the following equation Eq. (63) : 

th = F R ( τ α) − F R U L 
η

(63) 

Usually, the thermal loss coeﬃcient ( U L ) is approximated by the 
following expression. This expression includes the dependence on 
the operating temperature in order to consider the thermal radia- 
tion losses, which are more intense in high operating temperature 
levels. 
U L = c 1 + c 2 · ( T m − T a ) 

(64) 

(55) 

Therefore,  the  general  equation  for  thermal  eﬃciency  can  be 

In order to take into account, the impact of the incident solar 
angle ( θ ), the incident angle modiﬁer ( K θ ) is taken into account. 
This factor signiﬁes the optical eﬃciency ratio in the solar angle 
( θ ) to the optical eﬃciency for zero solar angle. Usually, for the 
FPC system, the following equation is used:

For a single glaze collector, a common value for the parameter

3.5.2. Photovoltaic Thermal System 

Evaluating PVT system performance is a combination of thermal 

and electrical eﬃciencies. 

(cid:26)

The electrical eﬃciency output of the collector is deﬁned as a 
function of the average temperature of the photovoltaic module. It 
is calculated using the following formula Eq. (58) [26] : 
el = η

(58) 
Where ( β) is the photovoltaic module temperature dependence 
coeﬃcient.  Moreover,  ( η

For example, Budihardjo et al. [300] determined the coeﬃcients 
in the thermal eﬃciency equation from an experimental study on 
evacuated  tube  solar  water  heater  as:  F R ( τ α) = 0.536,  c

W/m 2 K and c 

2 = 0.0069 W/m 2 K 2 . 

3.5.4. Direct Absorption Solar Collector 

For  conventional  solar  collectors,  the  incident  solar  radiation 
is captivated by the selective absorber and transformed into heat 
then transferred to heat transfer ﬂuid (HTF). In the DASC the work- 
ing  ﬂuid  is  acting  as  both  absorber  and  HTF  [94] ,  as  shown  in 
Fig. 6 . Using the nanoparticles in the base ﬂuid inﬂuence the na- 
ture of both absorption and scattering [301] . Therefore, more com- 
plex relations include particle parameters, will be used [ 64 , 302 ]. 

Fig.  7  shows  a  schematic  diagram  for  a  nanoﬂuid  ﬂowing  in 
DASC  with  the  height  of  H.  The  top  of  the  collector  is  covered 
with a transmitted glass. Thermal insulation is used to eliminate 
the bottom and edges losses. As shown in Fig. 7 in the DASC the 
transmitted solar radiation is absorbed volumetrically by nanopar- 
ticles resulting in the volumetric generation of heat and causes an 
instant heat transfer to the surroundings [ 302 , 304 ]. The heat loss 
from the top of the collector to the ambient through convection

sides, by equating Eq. (72) and Eq. (73) , the radiative properties of

3.6. Eﬃciency based on the 2 nd law of thermodynamics or Exergy 
Analysis 

The  eﬃciency  based  on  the  second  law  or  exergy  eﬃciency 
( ηex ) is calculated collectively from the 1 st  and 2 nd  laws of ther- 
modynamics.  Exergy  is  described  as  the  maximum  output  that 
can be accomplished, corresponding to the environmental temper- 
ature. In this steady-state system, the potential and kinetic energy 
both are insigniﬁcant. All the properties (mainly thermophysical) 
of nanoﬂuids at the entry and exit of the solar collector are persis- 
tent. Both the heat and work transfer from the system is positive. 
Thus the overall equation of the exergy balance Eq. (83) for pro- 
cesses which are a steady ﬂow and steady-state [ 309 , 310 ]: 

˙ E x in +  ˙ E x s +  ˙ E x out +  ˙ E x 

l +  ˙ E x 

d = 0 

(83) 

The exergy rate at the inlet calculates the ﬂow of ﬂuid, and the 
solar radiation absorbed. The exergy rate at the inlet can be evalu- 
ated from the following relation Eq. (58) [ 310 , 311 ]:

surroundings at the inlet point and ρ is the density of the ﬂuid. It 
is beneﬁcial for temperature levels in the exergy analysis must be 
in Kelvin units in order to have proper mathematical procedures.

(89) 

(90) 

where ( U L ) is the overall heat loss coeﬃcient. A typical value of 
this parameter for an FPC is around 5 W/m 2 K [310] . Due to the 
temperature difference between the absorber plate surface and the 
sun, there is a destroyed exergy rate, which can be calculated as 
Eq. (90) [314] : 

˙ E x

Due to the pressure drop, the rate of destroyed exergy is given

(91) 

Now  the  change  in  the  rate  of  destroyed  exergy  affected  by 
the difference in temperature among the absorber plate and agent 
ﬂuid can be stated as Eq. (92) [309] : 
(cid:2)

Therefore, the overall rate of destroyed exergy can be expressed 

as Eq. (93) :

(93) 

So  relating  all  the  above-mentioned  relations,  the  overall  ef- 
ﬁciency  of  exergy  for  the  solar  collector  can  be  calculated  as 
Eq. (94) [310] :

For the PVT system based on the second law of thermodynam- 
ics, the exergy eﬃciency can be estimated. It means the eﬃciency 
converted to work in an ideal Carnot process [315] . The PV mod- 
ule’s exergy eﬃciency is equal to the electrical eﬃciency genera- 
tion. The thermal exergy of the collector is the part of the energy 
that could be converted to work in an ideal Carnot process. The

3.7. Exergoeconomic and exergoenvirnmental Analysis 

The annual salvage value (ASV) of the solar energy system is 

Most  solar  collectors  are  evaluated  based  on  the  energy  ap- 
proach, whereas less work has been done on evaluating the exergy 
approach. Although the energy systems can be scrutinized and op- 
timized using the exergy analysis approach, some limitations still 
exist in disregarding the economic and environmental limits for in- 
vestigating engineering processes. Therefore, for energy-based sys- 
tems assessed on the one-dimensional exergy approach, can only 
provide rough ﬁndings because of these shortcomings. This indi- 
cates that in order to make more sensible decisions, economic and 
environmental limitations must be measured in combination with 
the exergy approach. On the economic analysis basis, various pa- 
rameters are indicated in the equations Eq. (93) - (106) , are vital for 
having information on the cost of the production and the payback 
period of any system that is operated by renewable energy. In this 
aspect, among the various procedures recognized, innovative ap- 
proaches  based  on  exergy  analysis,  such  as  the  exergoeconomic 
and exergoenvirnmental have gained the focus of researchers, as 
these methods can be used for evaluating both the ﬁnancial as well 
as environmental aspects of the energy systems [ 316 , 317 ]. 

3.7.1. Energy payback time 

The time needed to retrieve the embodied energy for solar col- 
lector systems, which is expressed in terms of energy and exergy 
approaches,  is  deﬁned  as  the  criterion  of  energy  payback  time 
(EPBT). The embodied energy also considers the amount of con- 
sumed energy in each process of fabrication for each component 
and  part  of  the  solar  collector  system.  The  following  equations 
are used to obtained both the energy and exergy EPBT as follows 
[ 318 , 319 ]: 

expressed as follows [322] : 
ASV = SSF · S 0 

(102) 

As the solar-operated systems will need some annual mainte- 
nance,  the  annual  cost  of  the  system,  incorporating  the  annual 
maintenance costs are shown by the equations presented below. 
The operational maintenance cost of the energy system yearly, i.e., 
annual maintenance cost (AMC), is assumed at 10% of the ﬁxed an- 
nual cost (FAC). Therefore, the uniform annual cost (UAC) are given 
as follows: 
AMC = 0 . 1 · F AC 

(103) 

UAC = AMC + F AC − ASV 

3.7.3. Exergoeconomic analysis 

(104) 

The economic analysis approach based on the exergy is known 
as the exergoeconomic analysis. The performance of solar energy 
systems is improved by integrating the exergy analysis with the 
conventional cost [318] . This approach aims to facilitate the design- 
ers, with an estimated cost of the optimal structure, optimal cost 
values, and different approaches for enhancing the performance of 
the energy systems.  In most  of the published works,  exergoeco- 
nomic parameters, are calculated to reduce the loss by consider- 
ing the exergy loss per unit cost. But for the solar energy systems 
that are reviewed in this paper, this approach is not suitable as 
typically  no  penalty  is  paid  for  the  exergy  losses,  and  also,  the 
solar radiation, which is input, is something that is based on the 
weather conditions and cannot be controlled. Therefore, the exer- 
goeconomic parameter (R ex ) of the solar energy systems, which is 
the ratio of the yearly exergy output to the yearly cost, can be ob- 
tained as follows [323] :

(105) 

Where,  E 

in  is  the  embodied  energy,  E en,out  shows  the  energy 
output and E ex,out shows the exergy output, during the lifetime of 
the solar collectors. 

3.7.2. Economic analysis 

The main objective of using solar collectors is to enhance the 
eﬃciency and production of these collectors and to reduce the pro- 
duction cost. For any solar energy system, considering the initial 
investment cost is P (which takes into account materials cost, such 
as the piping, aluminum, galvanized iron, etc.), where the annual 
interest rate for such capital being r (%) and the number of use- 
ful years, for which the considered system will perform, then the 
ﬁrst annual cost (FAC) [320] and the capital recovery factor (CRF) 
[321] of the solar energy system can be obtained using the follow- 
ing expressions: 

F AC = CRF · P s 

CRF = 

i ( 1 + i ) n 
( 1 + i ) n − 1 

(98) 

(99) 

Where,  the  sinking  fund  factor  is  represented  by  SSF  and  S 
0 
represents the salvage value of the solar energy system, which are 
estimated by: 

S 0 = 0 . 2 · P s 

SSF = 

i 
( i + n ) n − 1 

(100) 

(101) 

33 

The cost of carbon dioxide (CO 

2 ) is one of the main parame- 
ters  that contribute  to the  enviro-economic analysis. Using solar 
collectors,  which  are  operated  using  a  renewable  energy  source, 
which  in  turn  reduces  carbon  emissions,  which  result  in  posing 
a higher hazard to the environment. Savacool conducted a show- 
ing the electricity generation from a coal power plant, showed that 
the average carbon emission to the environment is around 980 g 
of CO 
2 /kWh. They further analyzed that about 20% of losses occur 
during the distribution, and 40% of losses occur during the trans- 
mission because of the ineﬃcient electrical equipment, therefore 
increasing the value further to 2 kg CO 
2 /kWh [324] . Therefore, an- 
nual emission of CO 
2 based on the energy and exergy analysis is 
computed as shown below: 
ψ C O 2 . E out

Where, ψ C O

protects the absorber plate from the outside environment, which 
allows  almost  90%  of  sunlight  to  pass  through  it.  The  absorber 
plate is placed just below the riser tube is usually made up of alu- 
minum and layered with unique sensitive material, which makes 
the absorber plate so eﬃcient for captivating sunlight and, in turn, 
converts that sunlight into useful heat. The riser and header tubes 
are welded together to make one hard heat exchanger for transfer- 
ring the heat to heat transfer ﬂuid ﬂowing inside the tubes [328] . 
Beginning in 2012, the improvement in heat transfer character- 
istics of FPC’s has been reviewed by many scientists. Youseﬁ et al. 
[329-331] have done numerous experiments on this topic, and they 
intensely reviewed the performance of FPC by varying different pa- 
rameters and tried to evaluate the consequence of different kinds 
of nanoparticles and other thermophysical properties of nanoﬂu- 
ids,  and  they  gave  some  new  hope  to  modify  this  kind  of  solar 
collectors. Youseﬁ et al. [329] initially evaluated the consequences 
of pH deviation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes/water nanoﬂu- 
ids on the effectiveness of FPC with Triton X-100 as an additional 
surfactant. According to their results, with the variation in pH, the 
eﬃciency of FPC changes, they have shown that the nanoﬂuids de- 
veloped extra acidic, which in turn increases the eﬃciency of ﬂat 
plate solar collectors. In their other study, Youseﬁ et al. [330] have 
measured the eﬃciency of FPC by varying the mass ﬂow rate and 
weight fraction of MWCNT/water nanoﬂuids from 0.0167 to 0.05 
kg/s and 0.2% to 0.4% respectively. There was a slight increase in 
eﬃciency  with  the  further  addition  of  surfactant  at  the  weight 
fraction of 0.2% and around 0.4% without adding a surfactant. The 
study  of  Youseﬁ and  his  group  [331]  did  not  stop  here,  Youseﬁ
et al. [330] measured the consequence of surfactant on the eﬃ- 
ciency of FPC with Al 
3 /water as nanoﬂuid, and they found that 
at the 0.2% weight fraction of nanoﬂuids, the eﬃciency of the col- 
lector was increased by 28.3% when compared to water as a heat 
transfer ﬂuid and by adding the surfactant the eﬃciency was in- 
creased by 15.63% maximally. Ali et al. [332] have investigated the 
CuO/water  nanoﬂuids  for  the  eﬃciency  of  FPC.  The  weight  frac- 
tion and particle size of nanoparticles for the experiment are 0.4% 
and 40 nm, respectively. Their ﬁndings showed an increase in ef- 
ﬁciency with nanoﬂuids, which was about 16.7% when compared 
with  water  as  a  heat  transfer  ﬂuid.  Said  et  al.  [333]  have  done 
numerous experiments on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWC-

4.1. Flat Plate Collector 

In the last 30 years, numerous designs of ﬂat plate solar col- 
lectors have been manufactured and examined [88] . Usually, slight 
changes in their manufacturing strategies and principles of opera- 
tions are performed to optimize the existing systems. The FPC is 
reported as the most useful solar heaters, and at the same time, 
they have somewhat less eﬃciency relatively [97] . FPC is the most 
usual domestic and industrial system because of its easy installa- 
tions, satisfying stability, and relatively low cost. However, it is not 
able  to  operate  in  temperature  levels  over  100 o C  and  extremely 
cold climate conditions. So, there is a need for improving this sys- 
tem to enlarge the operating conditions where the FPC can be an 
effective solar technology. Hottel and Whillier [327] made the ﬁrst 
setup  of  FPC  in  the  early  1950s.  From  that  on,  innumerable  at- 
tempts have been made to increase its thermal effectiveness. 

The internal view of a ﬂat plate which is used in the solar col- 
lector  is  displayed  in  Fig.  8 ,  while  the  whole  ﬂat  plate  setup  is 
shown in Fig. 9 . The simple ﬂat plate consists of an absorber plate, 
a glass sheet, a back sheet, a riser, header pipes, and aluminum 
bars. The glass used is toughened and transparent, which usually

ical performance of FPC for the ﬁrst time. As per their results, the 
energy eﬃciency was increased up to 95.12% maximally, but at the 
same time, the exergy eﬃciency was still low around 26.25%. 

Faizal  et  al.  [334]  and  Saleh  et  al.  [335]  have  evaluated  the

performance of SiO 
ter knowing that the thermal conductivity of SiO 
2 nanoparticles is 
comparatively low. Faizal et al. [334] calculated the improvement

a  ﬂat  plate  collector,  as  per  their  ﬁndings  the  eﬃciency  is  en- 
hanced  up  to  23.5%  with  0.2%  nanoparticles  volume  concentra- 
tion. Additionally, they have a calculated decrease in CO 
2 emission, 
which was around 170 kg. Saleh et al. [335] investigate the perfor- 
mance of FPC by varying the mass ﬂow rate of nanoﬂuids between 
the range of 0.018 – 0.045 kg/s. As per their results, the eﬃciency 
enhancement is dependent on the increase in the concentration of 
nanoparticles in nanoﬂuids from 0 to 1% and leads to an increase 
in eﬃciency up to 4% to 8%. Sarawut and Tanongkiat [336] inves- 
tigated the thermal performance of FPC at elevated temperatures 
by  using  silver  nanoﬂuids.  The  size  of  nanoparticle  and  concen- 
tration  of  nanoﬂuids  was  20  nm  and  10 0 0-10,0 0 0  ppm,  respec- 
tively, and inlet temperature varies within the range of 35-65 °C. 
The schematic diagram of the experiment is shown in Fig. 9 . As 
per their results, the eﬃciency increased at high inlet temperature 
and high concentration of nanoparticles. Faizal et al. [ 337 , 338 ] nu- 
merically investigated the potential for area reduction of FPC, and 
they found that 22.1%, 21.6%, 21.5%, 25.6% of enhancement can be

compared to operation with pure water. Their experimental setup 
is also shown in Fig. 11 . They also evaluated the effect of ﬂow rates 
of nanoﬂuids on the eﬃciency of the solar collector and reported 
that a low ﬂow rate causes more sedimentation. As sedimentation 
affects the performance, so Said et al. [340] added dispersant to 
improve the stability of the nanoparticles in their used nanoﬂuids. 
They added polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) and examined the ther- 
2 O and the maximum achieved exergy

ties of SWCNTs nanoﬂuids and its effects on exergy eﬃciency of a

for a 0.3% vol. of SWCNTs as well as improved energy and exergy 
eﬃciencies by 95.12% and 26.25% respectively with the mass ﬂow

Recently,  Kabeel  et  al.  [ 342 , 343 ]  conducted  several  experi- 
ments  to  assess  the  performance  of  ﬂat  plate  solar  collectors. 
They  [342]  experimentally  investigated  the  process  of  solar  wa- 
ter  heating  by  using  FPC  and  helical  coil  heat  exchanger  using 
Al 
3 /water nanoﬂuids. The eﬃciency of the collector, the effec- 
tiveness of the helical heat exchanger, and temperature at the out- 
let was enhanced by 11%, 98%, and 5.46%, respectively. In another 
study  [343] ,  they  evaluated  the  desalination  system  with  small- 
scale single-stage ﬂash using Cu/water nanoﬂuid as heat transfer 
ﬂuid. They have done the analysis economically and indicated the 
need to modify the solar collector area optimally for high produc- 
tion. Gianpiero et al. [ 344 , 345 ] conducted a series of experiments 
using Al 
3 /water as the heat transfer medium. In their ﬁrst exper- 
iments, they changed the shape of top and bottom headers in solar 
collectors to maintain the constant heat transfer ﬂuid ﬂow. With 
this  modiﬁcation,  they  achieved  an  enhancement  of  25%  in  the 
convective  heat  transfer  coeﬃcient.  In  another  experiment,  they 
carried out their previous experiment with more modiﬁcations. In 
this experiment, they inserted a wedge-shaped element in top and 
bottom headers, which achieved an enhancement of 11% in ther- 
mal eﬃciency. Michael et al. [346] considered Cu-H 
2 O nanoﬂuids 
with  a  constant  volume  concentration  of  0.05%.  In  their  experi- 
ments, they found an improvement of 6.3% in collector eﬃciency. 
The experimental setup used by them is displayed in Fig. 12 .

Vijayakumaar et al. [347] estimated the ﬂat plate solar collec- 
tor performance utilizing SWCNT (single-walled carbon nanotube)/ 
water nanoﬂuid. The setup used during the experiment is shown 
in  Fig.  13 .  The  nanoﬂuids  comprised  of  0.40%,  0.50%  and  0.60% 
weight  fraction.  Regarding  water,  the  eﬃciency  of  FPC  increased

to 39% at 0.5 wt%. The increment is because of the effectiveness 
of nanoparticle Brownian motion and stability of nanoﬂuid in im- 
proving thermal conductivity and heat transfer rate. Thus, accord- 
ing to their work, it can be concluded that using SWCNT/water in- 
creases the overall performance of a ﬂat plate solar collector even 
at low weight percentages. Jamal-Abad et al. [348] prepared the 
Cu-water nanoﬂuids using a single-step method and investigated 
the  performance  of  ﬂat  plate  solar  collectors.  They  used  35  nm 
Cu nanoparticle and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) as a surfactant 
for the preparation of nanoﬂuids. According to their results, the ef- 
fectiveness of FPC is directly dependent on the weight fraction of 
nanoﬂuids, and they found an increase of 24% in the eﬃciency of 
the collector compared to the water.

tions of 0.5% to 2% with the mass ﬂow rate of 0.5 lpm to 2 lpm

nanoﬂuid  leads  to  meet  the  turbulent  regimes  or  transient  ﬂow 
regime, which certainly causes higher heat transfer rates, especially 
when  combined  with  nanoﬂuid  effects.  Tora  et  al.  [350]  numer- 
ically  simulated  the  performance  of  ﬂat  plate  solar  collectors  at 
different sizes of nanoparticles (15, 30, 60, and 90 nm) and dif- 
ferent volume fractions (0.01–0.5%). According to their numerical 
results, the maximum collector eﬃciency was enhanced by 14.7% 
and  37.44%  at  0.01%  and  a  0.5%  volume  fraction.  It  means  that 
there  is  no  linear  relation  between  the  concentration  increasing 
and collector eﬃciency. It needs to ﬁnd the optimum nanoparti- 
cle concentration rate to reach the most achievable performance. 

Based on the literature review, the FPC performance is relatively 
low, and it can be signiﬁcantly enhanced by utilizing nanoﬂuids. 
Various types of nanoﬂuids have been tested in this regard, and 
various values of eﬃciency enhancements have been reported. The 
most effective nanoparticles are the SWCNT and the Cu because 
they can increase the effective thermal conductivity in a signiﬁ- 
cant way. Also, the use of other nanoparticles such as Al 
3  and 
TiO 
2  was  found  to  be  a  choice.  However,  the  use  of  nanoﬂuids 
faces problems due to the stability issues and the long-term per- 
formance of the nanoﬂuid-based FPC. The studies show for the sta- 
bility of the nanoﬂuids in FPC is not so usual, and thus there is a 
great need for conducting more studies in this area. It is crucial 
to design the proper systems with long-term stability in order to 
commercialize the nanoﬂuid-based solar FPC in the next years.

4.2. PVT System 

A Photovoltaic (PV) cell is a technology used to convert sunlight 
directly into electricity. Its typical eﬃciency varies between 8% to 
15% depending on the weather conditions and solar cell type. The 
rest of the incoming solar radiations are converted to heat when 
the photons coming from the solar spectrum do not have enough 
energy to knock electrons free from the solar cell atoms and gen- 
erate a ﬂow of electrons; this process leads to an increment in the 
solar cell temperature which decreases its electrical output [351] . 
A practical method to limit this temperature rise is to increase the 
heat capacity (the ratio of the heat removed from the cell to the 
temperature change). One technique to increase the thermal capac- 
itance is using a Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) collector [ 352 , 353 ]. 

More speciﬁcally, in the PVT collector ( Fig. 14 ), a thermal col- 
lector  is  integrated  with  the  PV  module  to  extract  the  heat  to 
cool down this module. Cooling the PV cell is beneﬁcial because 
a colder cell is more eﬃcient than a hotter cell. PVT systems can 
simultaneously produce electrical and thermal energies, leading to 
higher overall eﬃciency than conventional PV modules and ther- 
mal  collectors.  Hybrid  PV  modules  with  the  thermal  unit  (PVT) 
are known for their attractive advantages such as eﬃcient, cheap, 
practical, and ﬂexible. Also, they have a wide range of applications 
since they comply with both thermal and electrical demands. The 
research on PVT collectors started in the 1970s with an aim to in- 
crease their overall energy eﬃciency; initially, researchers focused 
on glazed PVT systems with different heat removal ﬂuids [ 26 , 354 ]. 
The  carrier  of  heat  can  be  either  water  or  air  [355] .  Accord- 
ing to Prakash [356] , the obtained thermal eﬃciency using water is 
higher than the obtained one when using air due to the low heat 

37 

transfer between the air and the absorber in the thermal collec- 
tor. Recently, researchers are focusing on using nanoﬂuids as the 
working ﬂuid in PVT systems because they have higher thermal, 
mechanical, and optical properties than the water, so the perfor- 
mance of PVT systems will be enhanced [26] . 

Several publications have demonstrated the use of nanoﬂuids 
as coolants in PVT systems from thermodynamics viewpoints fo- 
cusing on different PVT designs and types of nanoparticles with 
various concentrations and baseﬂuids. Nanoﬂuids in PVT are an ex- 
citing idea because the nanoﬂuids are more effective working ﬂu- 
ids than the conventional due to their unique thermal properties. 
More speciﬁcally, the use of nanoﬂuids can increase heat transfer 
rates and improve the heat removal process from the PV cell. Ther- 
modynamics 1 st law is used when the target of the designed PVT 
system is to obtain more overall energy output in quantity where 
energy balance is used. 

Al-Waeli et al. [357] investigated the thermophysical properties 
of  SiC/water  nanoﬂuid  experimentally  as  a  coolant  for  PVT  sys- 
tems. The schematic of the test rig is illustrated in Fig. 15 , where 
the nanoﬂuid storage tank is linked to the water reservoir using a 
heat exchanger. They discovered that the usage of 3 wt.% could en- 
hance the thermal conductivity, density, and viscosity for a temper- 
ature range of (25-60) °C, indicating a stable solution. SiC nanoﬂuid 
increased  the  thermal  eﬃciency  up  to  100.19%  compared  to  the 
water use only. The electrical eﬃciency was compared to a stan- 
dard PV module, and the overall eﬃciency increased by 24.1% and 
88.9%, respectively. The variation of electrical, thermal, and total ef- 
ﬁciency of the PVT over time for both coolant water and nanoﬂuid 
is shown in Fig. 16 . As can be observed from Fig. 16 , nanoparticles 
affect the eﬃciencies positively and signiﬁcantly. However, electri- 
cal eﬃciency increment with nanoﬂuid is not that high when it is 
compared with other types of eﬃciencies. It can be because of the 
increasing effect of nanoparticles on the viscosity of the nanoﬂuid, 
which increases the pumping power. 

2 O 

In another work by Al-Waeli et al. [358] , they tested three dif- 
ferent nanoparticles (Al 
3 , CuO, and SiC) by adding them to wa- 
ter  as  a  baseﬂuid  to  investigate  the  best  nanoparticles type  and 
concentration for PVT applications. Their results showed that SiC 
nanoﬂuid with a 4% volume fraction has the highest thermal con- 
ductivity and stability, so it enhanced the performance of the PVT 
system more than the other nanoparticles types. The effect of us- 
ing different nanoﬂuids for thermal and electrical performance of 
the PVT is depicted in Fig. 17 . It can be noted that different types 
of nanoparticles lead to a different level of stability and thermal 
conductivity. This affects the performance of the utilized nanoﬂuid 
in the applied PVT system. 

Michael and Iniyan [359] constructed a novel PVT by laminat- 
ing copper sheets to the PV cells directly to reduce the thermal 
losses between the cells and the cooling medium. They also used 
a Cu/water nanoﬂuid instead of water. They concluded the ther- 
mal eﬃciency enhancement of about 45.76%. They suggested using 
a heat exchanger with high effectiveness to improve the electrical 
output of PV modules. 

2 O 

Rejeb et al. [360] evaluated the performance of the uncovered 
sheet and tube PVT type experimentally and numerically by us- 
ing different baseﬂuids (pure water and ethylene glycol), nanoﬂu- 
ids types (Cu and Al 
3 ) and concentrations (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 wt.%). 
Their work indicated a higher PVT system performance when us- 
ing 0.4 wt.% of Cu nanoparticles with water as a baseﬂuid. Hjerrild 
et al. [361] tested using CNT and Ag-SiO 
2 nanoﬂuid in water to in- 
crease the eﬃciency of PVT collectors; they chose these materials 
because of their high solar absorptivity. The results indicated an 
enhancement in the combined eﬃciency of 30% compared to the 
baseﬂuid ﬁlter. 

Also, the application of the second law of thermodynamics is an 
exciting tool to design and optimize the PVT system to obtain more

in PVT systems under constant and variable magnetic ﬁelds. They 
noticed an improvement in the overall energy output when using 
3 wt.% of the nano ferroﬂuid by 45% and 50% under the constant 
and alternating ﬁelds, respectively. They also concluded that un- 
der the variable magnetic ﬁeld, the total exergy output increased 
to 48 W. Applicability of ferroﬂuid under magnetic ﬁelds can be 
more affecting on the performance compared to the conventional 
nanoﬂuids. It is due to the positive effect of the magnetic ﬁeld on 
4 nanoparticles to create a higher Brownian motion and better

Sardarabadi et al. [353] experimented with investigating the ef- 
fect  of  ZnO/H

by more than 13% and in the thermal output by almost 5%. The 
simultaneous use of the nanoﬂuid and PCM increased the overall 
exergy eﬃciency by more than 23%. In another work, Shojaeizadeh

optimization for nanoﬂuid Al

cle concentration, ﬂuid inlet temperature, and its mass ﬂow rate 
assuming uncontrollable ambient temperature and solar radiation. 
They obtained an exponential decrease for the optimum exergy ef- 
ﬁciency and the optimum parameters by increasing the ambient 
temperature ratio to solar radiations. They also concluded that the 
optimum exergy eﬃciency has a linear relation with the optimized

parameters, including PV cell eﬃciency, packing factor, the ratio of 
water mass to collector area, wind velocity, ambient temperature,

that using glazed collector results in higher energy eﬃciency than 
the unglazed one for all the six examined parameters. Based on 
thermodynamics  second  law,  the  unglazed  system  increased  the 
eﬃciency of PV cell, packing factor, the ratio of water mass to the 
area of the collector, and velocity of the wind.

nanoﬂuid  in  a  PVT  system  with  different  concentrations  experi-

creasing with time passing which shows the increase in the ca- 
pability  of  nanoﬂuid  by  being  heated  due  to  the  radiation.  This 
can improve the nanoparticle motions, which leads to a more sta-

of the nanoparticles, the energy/exergy eﬃciencies and heat trans- 
fer  coeﬃcient  increase.  In  literature,  Fayaz  et  al.  [369]  observed 
the effect of cooling on MWCNT/water nanoﬂuid in PVT collector 
experimentally  and  numerically  for  a  range  of  a  mass  ﬂow  rate 
from 30 to 120 L/h. Good consistency was obtained between the 
experimental and numerical results. At a ﬂow rate of 120 L/h, the 
electrical eﬃciency improved by 12.75% and 10.72% for experimen- 
tal and numerical cases, respectively, while the thermal eﬃciency 
was found to be 5.13% experimentally and 5.62% numerically. Aber- 
oumand et al. [370] analyzed the effect of different ﬂow regimes of 
Ag/water nanoﬂuid in PVT systems. Their results showed that the

case of “silica/water nanoﬂuid 3 wt.% (b) [365] . 

output power improved by enhancing the ﬂow rate and nanoﬂuid 
concentration. By using 4% of Ag/water nanoﬂuid with turbulent 
ﬂow, the power increased to 35% and 10%, compared to when using 
no  cooling  and  water  cooling,  respectively.  The  exergy  eﬃciency 
was found to be 50% higher than with no cooling and 30% higher 
than water cooling. Hassani et al. [371] evaluated the energetic life 
cycle  analysis  theoretically  of  three  various  nanoﬂuid-based  PVT 
systems arrangements and their environmental impact. Their re- 
sults indicated a higher performance of the nanoﬂuid-based PVT 
system  compared  to  a  traditional  PV  and  PVT  systems.  The  PVT 
2 O nanoﬂuid-based optical ﬁlter produced 
conﬁguration with Ag/ H 
the highest exergy output of 1.3 MWh m -2  year with 2 years of 
payback  time  compared  to  the  other  conﬁgurations;  it  also  can 
prevent 448 kg eq m -2 year -1 of CO

In  another  experimental  investigation  by  Abadeh  et  al.  [372] , 
the use of different nanoﬂuids in PVT systems has been studied. 
It  is  found  that  the  electrical  eﬃciency  can  be  improved  by  7% 
compared to a standard PV module. From the energy viewpoint, 
the  system  materials  can  be  reduced  to  21,  32,  33,  and  24%  by 
using pure water, PVT/TiO 
3 , respectively. 
From  the  environmental  viewpoint,  the  emission  production  can 
be reduced by 17% when using a nanoﬂuid-based PVT system com- 
pared to a PV unit. From an economic viewpoint that will be dis- 
cussed later in this paper, the authors considered ﬁve different sce- 
narios to calculate the payback period; they got the shortest pay- 
back period of 2.5 years for the PVT system, which has a 75% gov- 
ernment subsidy. Elmir et al. [373] conducted a numerical study 
to  understand  the  performance  of  a  photovoltaic  collector  using 
Al 
3 /water  as  the  heat  transfer  ﬂuid.  An  enhancement  of  27% 
in the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient was achieved when the 
fraction increases from 1% to 10 wt.%, which leads to the improve-

ment of their electrical eﬃciency. Hussain et al. [374] studied the 
impact of using a nanoﬂuid within a PVT collector. The maximum 
temperature of the photovoltaic module is 57.4 °C for the water 
against 53.7 °C, 50.6 °C for Al

The previous studies show clearly that there is much interest 
in  the  use  of  nanoﬂuids  as  heat  transfer  ﬂuids  in  PVT.  Numer- 
ous nanoﬂuids have been used in the aforementioned studies with 
the use of water as the baseﬂuid to be the signiﬁcant case. Dif- 
ferent nanoparticles such as ZnO, Al 
2, and 
SiC have been tested. Generally, there are found essential enhance- 
ments in the overall eﬃciency of the system and, more speciﬁcally, 
both in the thermal and the electrical output. The most promising 
nanoﬂuids are the ZnO/water and SiC/water, according to the liter- 
ature.

4.3. Evacuated Tube type 

Evacuated tube collectors (ETC) is a solar system that can op- 
erate in low and medium temperature levels (up to 180 o C). It is 
in the same classiﬁcation as the FPC because it is not a concen- 
trating technology. The important part of the ETC is the evacuated 
tubes, which have a vacuum in order to reduce the thermal losses. 
They  present increased performance compared to  the FPC  [375] , 
but they also have higher costs than FPC. The main two conﬁgu- 
rations ETC used are: the heat pipe and the U tube collector (see 
Fig.  20 ).  In  terms  of  performance,  the  heat  pipe  has  better  eﬃ- 
ciency than the U tube collector during the sunny day while the 
thermal performance of U-tube ETC is better for cloudy days [376] . 
Moreover, in many designs, there is a reﬂector under the evacu- 
ated tubes to increase the absorbed solar energy and increase the 
useful heat production. 

To  enhance  the  performance  of  ETC,  many  authors  suggested 
the suspension of nanoparticles in a baseﬂuid to form nanoﬂuid. 
The use of nanoﬂuid in ETC was pioneered by Chien et al. [377] af- 
ter using gold nanoparticles in an aqueous solution to reduce the 
thermal resistance in a disk-shaped heat pipe. A decrease of 40% in 
the thermal resistance was achieved in their experiment. Lu et al. 
[378] designed a unique thermosiphon system based on evacuated 
tubular collectors using water-based CuO nanoﬂuids. They showed 
that the concentration of mass for the CuO nanoparticles has a sig- 

40 

niﬁcant impact on the coeﬃcient of heat transfer. The thermal per- 
formance of the ETC had increased by about 30% for an optimum 
mass  concentration  of  CuO  nanoparticles  of  1.2%.  The  increased 
thermal performance is due to the increased thermal conductivity 
and enhanced heat transfer properties. In a different study, Mahen- 
2 O 
dran et al. [379] examined the eﬃciency of an ETC using TiO 
nanoﬂuid. They found out that the temperature at the exit has in- 
creased by 19% when using nanoﬂuid instead of the distilled water. 
At the same time, the eﬃciency of the system using TiO 
2 nanoﬂuid 
increased by 16.67% compared to its baseﬂuid. An extensive study 
was carried out by Al-Mashat and Hasan [380] to investigate nu- 
merically and experimentally the performance enhancement of an 
ETC using Al 
3 /water nanoﬂuid. They conclude that the system 
eﬃciency increased proportionally with the increase of the volume 
3 . A maximum enhancement of 28.4% was observed 
fraction of Al 
3, which is the optimum value for mass 
for 1 vol. % of Al 
concentration.

Sabiha et al. [381] conducted an experimental study on a heat 
pipe ETC using water-based SWCNT nanoﬂuid having different vol- 
ume concentrations. The experimental arrangement is presented in 
Fig. 21 . They observed that the maximum eﬃciency of the collector 
using nanoﬂuid is about 93.43% at 0.025 kg/s ﬂow rate and 0.2% 
volume concentration. The authors developed an empirical corre- 
lation  to  predict  the  thermal  eﬃciency  of  an  ETC  as  a  function 
of inﬂuencing parameters. Fig. 22 shows the variation of the ther- 
mal eﬃciency with the thermal conductivity at a constant 0.01kg/s 
mass ﬂow rate. As shown in Fig. 22 , increasing thermal conduc- 
tivity leads to an increase in the thermal eﬃciency of the system, 
which is shown linearly. However, the linear trend is not that much 
trustable as thermal conductivity is not the only parameter affect- 
ing thermal eﬃciency. 

In a different study, Park and Kim[382] used oxidized MWCNT 
nanoﬂuid in an ETC heat pipe. They obtained an increase in the 
thermal conductivity increased by 12.6% for a 0.1% low volumet- 
ric  ratio.  Also,  the  viscosity  of  the  oxidized  MWCNT  decreased 
by  about  11%  due  to  the  oxidization.  So,  the  viscosity  of  their 
nanoﬂuid  was  not  increased  considerably  due  to  oxidation,  high 
porosity, and high volume to the weight fraction of MWCNTs. In 
an  innovative  study,  Ghaderian  and  Sidik  [383]  investigated  the 
3 /water in a system of passive circulation ETC with 
effect of Al 
the internal spherical coil inside the horizontal tank. Under such 
conditions,  the  ETC  was  working  as  a  thermosyphon  system.  A 
schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 23 .

The eﬃciency of the ETC increased because of the higher ther- 
mal properties of the nanoﬂuid to reach 57.63% for 0.06% volume

was  calculated  for  one  year  under  Gwangiu  conditions.  The  re- 
sults demonstrated that this saving could contribute to reducing 
2  as well as a cost saving of 1750 
the emission of 1600 kg of CO 
USD for 50 collectors installed in Germany as shown in Fig. 24 . 

Kim et al. [386] established a theoretical analysis to study an 
evacuated U tube collector performance using various nanoﬂuids. 
The highest eﬃciency was obtained for 0.2 vol.% of MWCNT with 
an  improvement  of  20%  with  respect  to  the  baseﬂuid  propylene 
glycol-water. By using nanoﬂuids, as it was calculated, an annual 
reduction of 131.1 kg of coal, 345.3 kg of CO 
2  and, 1.1 kg of SO 
2 
can be achieved when 50 evacuated collectors are used. In a later 
publication, Kim et al. [387] proposed an experimental model to 
analyze  the  consequence  of  nanoparticles  and  concentration  on 
the thermal performance of a U-tube solar collector using Al 
2 O 
3 
nanoﬂuid. Their results indicated that eﬃciency increased by up to 
24.1% when using 1.0 vol. % of 20 nm Al 
3  instead of water. It 
is noted that the eﬃciency decreases by increasing in nanoparti- 
cle size which leads to decrease the stability of nanoﬂuid through 
increasing in nanoparticle precipitations. They concluded that eﬃ- 
ciency decreases by increasing the size of the nanoparticles. Few 
studies  have  examined  the  eﬃciency  of  exergy  or  entropy  gen- 
eration  in  evacuated  tube  collectors.  Ataee  and  Ameri  [388]  in- 
vestigated the exergy and eﬃciency of a U-Tube evacuated solar 
collector using CO 
2 and air as a working ﬂuid. The numerical re- 
sults showed that the highest exergy destruction is mainly due to 
the difference in temperature between the absorber and the sun. 
Recently, Naik et al. [389] conducted experimental and numerical 
work on the energy and exergy assessment of a U-Tube solar col- 
lector. Based on the obtained experimental results, empirical corre- 
lations were developed for both energy eﬃciency and exergy eﬃ- 
ciency as a function of the operating parameters and ambient tem- 
perature. The results show that the average energy and exergy ef-

fraction ad 60 l/h ﬂow rate. Another experiment [384] was carried 
out  using  the  same  setup  and  CuO  nanoﬂuid  in  which  the  eﬃ- 
ciency was enhanced to 51.4% at a volume fraction of 0.06%. Also, 
other authors used nanoﬂuids to enhance the performance of Evac- 
uated U-tube collectors. This study provides more detail that can 
be compared with MWCNT effectiveness on the ETC. A theoretical 
study was carried out by Tong et al. [385] to investigate the ther- 
mal performance of an evacuated U-tube collector using MWCNT 
nanoﬂuid as a working ﬂuid. The numerical results showed that 
the heat transfer coeﬃcient increased by 8% for 0.24% vol. concen- 
tration. The energy-saving using such solar collectors and nanoﬂuid

ﬁciency during a sunny day are about 43% and 41%, respectively. 
Fig. 25 shows the variation of energy and energy eﬃciencies dur- 
ing a sunny day. 

Based  on  the  theoretical  and  experimental  studies  of  using 
nanoﬂuid in evacuated tube collectors, the overall performance can 
be  enhanced  with  nanoﬂuid.  This  enhancement  is  supported  by 
the improvement of the thermophysical characteristics of the HTF, 
especially thermal conductivity. The introduction of nanoﬂuid will 
also affect the solar thermal installation design to meet the do-

mestic water requirements. The most usual nanoﬂuids in ETC are 
Al 
2 O. In any case, nanoﬂuid 
2 O, and CuO/ H 
cost and other limitations such as agglomeration, instability, and 
pressure drop are still challenging for industrialization.

4.4. Direct Absorption Solar Collector

sorbs the incident solar irradiation and its temperature increases. 
This collector is different from the other solar collectors because 
there is no absorber surface in the direct absorption solar collec- 
tor. Pure water is not such an adequate working ﬂuid in this col- 
lector  type,  and  thus  the  nanoﬂuids  have  been  examined  in  or- 
der to achieve higher performance. Several investigations showed 
a signiﬁcant improvement in the spectral optical properties of the 
working ﬂuid by adding less than 1% volume fraction of nanopar- 
ticles [ 63,390–393 ]. Thus, improving the thermal eﬃciency of con- 
ventional solar heaters inspired many researchers to study numeri- 
cally and experimentally the feasibility of using nanoﬂuid in DASC. 
Tyagi et al. [394] investigated numerically and compared the ther- 
mal performance of solar heaters using conventional plate absorber 
for FPC and a mixture of water and aluminum nanoparticles as an 
absorber for DASC. They found that the eﬃciency of DASC using 
nanoﬂuid is increased by 10% from conventional FPC. Another ex- 
perimental study performed by Otanicar et al. [395] used CNT, Ag, 
and graphite nanoﬂuids in DASC and recorded a 5% enhancement 
in collector eﬃciency. Luo et al. [396] built a two-dimensional nu- 
merical model for DASC using different types of nanoparticles such 
2 , graphite, and carbon nanotubes (CNT) 
as TiO 
in the base ﬂuid. The enhancing effect of nanoparticles in DASC is 
due to the increased heat transfer properties, which leads to an 
increase in the eﬃciency of the collector.

The radiation, conduction, and convection heat transfer equa- 
tions were solved numerically. The optical and thermal properties 
of the nanoﬂuids were determined experimentally and used to val- 
idate the numerical model. According to [396] an increase of 30 o C 
to  100 o C  and  2–25%  were  obtained  due  to  the  nanoﬂuid  in  the 
outlet temperature and thermal eﬃciency, respectively. An agree- 
ment occurred between numerical and experimental results. Ladje- 
vardi et al. [397] investigated the effect of using various diameters 
and volume concentration of graphite nanoparticles in the DASC 
thermal performance numerically. They recorded an enhancement 
in the extinction coeﬃcients in both UV and visible range around 
0.4 to 10 by increasing the nanoparticle diameter from 50 nm to 
300 nm. Moreover, an increase in the output temperature has been 
recorded due to the increase in volume fraction. Ladjevardi et al. 
[397]  showed  that  by  using  a  small  volume  fraction  (0.0 0 025%) 
of nanoparticles, an increase in outlet dimensionless temperature 
(from 0.27 to 0.915) compared to the conventional working ﬂuid 

43 

can  be  obtained  with  slight  additional  cost  (0.045  $/L).  Another 
study conducted by [398] , modeled the effect of various volume 
fractions  of  copper  Nanoparticles  and  Reynolds  number  in  the 
thermal performance of DASC. The study showed an enhancement 
in heat transfer rate and thermal eﬃciency of DASC for 200 < Re 
< 10 0 0 and volume fraction in the range 0% to 3%. 

Karami  et  al.  [399]  used  polyvinylpyrrolidone-Ag-coated 
nanoﬂuid at volume fractions, ﬂow rates, and collector tilt angles 
to  investigate  the  DASC  performance.  They  developed  empirical 
correlation  to  evaluate  Nusselt  number  to  calculate  the  heat 
transfer  coeﬃcient  when  Reynolds  and  Prandtl  number  in  the 
range  of  20  ≤ Re  ≤ 200  and  3  ≤ Pr  ≤ 6.  Also,  they  developed 
another  correlation  to  evaluate  collector  eﬃciency  and  proved 
their  accuracy.  Otanicar  et  al.  [400]  conduct  an  experimental 
study  on  DASC  using  CNT,  Ag,  and  graphite.  They  built  a  setup 
of 5 cm length, 2 cm width, and 0.015 cm, as shown in Fig. 26 
and  recorded  measurements  for  different  volume  fractions  and 
particle sizes. An enhancement in 5% thermal eﬃciency was ob- 
tained compared to the conventional solar collector. On the other 
hand, Otanicar et al. [400] demonstrated that maximum spectral 
absorption  could  be  obtained  in  DASC,  which  is  because  of  the 
size and type of the nanoparticles; hence various volume fraction, 
shape, size, and material of nanoparticles can be used in Fig. 27 . 
It  shows  that  a  nanoﬂuid-based  absorption  seems  to  be  a  more 
reliable  absorber  while  have  reduced  reﬂectance,  compared  to  a 
surface-based system made from the same material. Omar et al. 
[401]  modeled  DASC  to  study  the  effect  of  different parameters, 
e.g.,  collector  dimensions,  ﬂuid  ﬂow  rate,  and  nanoparticles  size 
and  concentration  on  the  collector  thermal  performance.  They 
used  four  nanoparticles  Al,  Ag,  Cu,  and  graphite  with  base  ﬂuid 
water and Therminol VP-1. As in Fig. 28 , collector eﬃciency has 
a direct relation with Ag nanoparticles volume fraction regardless 
of the base ﬂuid type. For Al, graphite, and Cu nanoparticles, the 
collector eﬃciency signiﬁcantly increases to an absolute value of 
volume  fraction  [401] .  The  studies  achieved  by  [402–406]  also 
examined the effect of the thermal performance of a DASC using 
various forms of nanoﬂuids. 

Hybrid nanoparticles were generated by blending different ra- 
tios of nanoparticles and used to investigate the eﬃciency of DASC 
by [407–410] . Lee et al. [407] used hybrid core-shell gold nanoﬂuid, 
and high eﬃciency of about 70% has been achieved. Zeiny et al.

[410] examined the enhancement of solar photo-thermal conver- 
sion based on DASC by using different nanoﬂuids (Au, Cu, Au-Cu 
hybrid, and carbon black). They found that blending increases the 
peak’s width, but the absorption peak value is reduced because of 
concentration dilution; therefore, solar energy absorption does not 
increase. Considering the economic cost and photo-thermal conver- 
sion, the carbon nanoﬂuid has more feasibility [410] . In recent in- 
vestigations achieved by [ 269 , 411-415 ], the topic has been focused 
on the effect of different dimensions and geometries of DASC us- 
ing different types of nanoﬂuids. Hatami et al. [413] used the ﬁ- 
nite element method and modeled the wavy bottom DASC shown 
2, and CuO 
in Fig. 29 using various volume fractions of Al 
nanoﬂuids. They evaluated the thermal performance and compared 
the local and average Nusselt number for the ﬂat and wavy DASC. 
The results presented that the high value of the local Nusselt num- 
ber occurred at the wavy shapes’ peak points, while the ﬂat shape 
has a higher average Nusselt number [413] . Hatami et al. [269] ex-

tended  their  work  on  a  wavy  shape  in  DASC  by  modeling  sev- 
eral cases with different wave amplitudes and wave-numbers us- 
ing FEM to estimate thermal performance and root mean square to 
obtain the best wavy proﬁle. 

A numerical model for a new conﬁguration of DASC has been 
studied by Amer et al. [416] , as shown in Fig. 30 . In their conﬁg- 
uration, the heat exchanger has been eliminated. Hence, the wa- 
ter ﬂowing inside the copper tube is submerged directly in a non- 
circulating nanoﬂuid within the glass cover. The transmitted solar 
radiation is absorbed by the nanoﬂuid, and the heat is transferred 
directly to the circulating water through copper walls. The circu- 
lating water eliminates the raising of nanoﬂuid temperature; thus, 
the thermal losses are reduced. Accordingly, the overall eﬃciency 
increased up to 65%, as reported by [416] for one meter of DASC 
with a glass-to-copper tube size ratio of ( ½). 

Based  on  the  theoretical  and  experimental  studies  in  DASC, 
it  is  clear  that  adding  an  even  low  amount  of  nanoparticles  to

To sum up, with the applicability of solar collectors, it is re- 
quired to classify them into two general classes of (i) concentrating 
and (ii) non-concentrating solar collectors. The non-concentrating 
types, which are the aim of this review paper, include Flat plate 
collectors (FPC) and evacuated tube collectors (ETC), as categorized 
in Fig. 31 . in this type of collectors, the collector area (the area that 
intercepts the solar radiation) is the same as the absorber area (the 
area that absorbs the radiation), and they are mainly designed and 
developed for solar hot water and industrial process heat applica- 
tions which require energy delivery at temperatures in the range of 
60-250 o C. These collectors mainly use both diffuse and beam sun- 
light and do not need to track the sun. They are also mechanically 
simpler and well-maintained than concentrating collectors [14] . 

5. Effect of the exergy on energy systems (solar collectors) 
using nanoﬂuids 

Exergy analysis is a thermodynamic tool to evaluate every en- 
ergy source according to its characteristics and usually according 
to its temperature levels. Moreover, the exergy analysis is used as 
an indicator in order to describe and analyze the proﬁtable side 
of green and sustainable technologies and renewable energies. Ex- 
ergy is also utilized for assessing and enhancing energy systems. 
It helps to a more evident appreciation of the beneﬁcial effects of 
renewable energies by providing the researchers with more crucial 
and useful information than energy analysis can provide. Exergy 
leads  to  identifying  enhancements  ineﬃciencies  and  decreasing 
thermodynamics drops, which align with more sustainable energy 
systems.  Furthermore,  it  can  help  more  accurately  than  energy 
analysis to understand the environmental and economic beneﬁts 
of energy systems. Enhancing energy eﬃciency can lead to reduced 
environmental effects by decreasing energy losses. These functions 
can  enhance  exergy  eﬃciency  and  decrease  exergy  losses,  inter- 
nal exergy consumption, and waste exergy emissions. However, ex- 
ergy  can  help  understand  energy  systems’  environmental  effects 
through new approaches [ 56 , 417 ]. Fig. 32 represents the correspon- 
dence between exergy eﬃciency enhancement and sustainable and 
emission index. Exergy eﬃciency enhancement leads to an increase 
in the sustainability index. On the other hand, emissions can be 
decreased with rising in exergy eﬃciency. 

In solar systems, the exergy eﬃciency indicates the exergy ﬂow 
of the produced useful heat to the incident solar irradiation ﬂow. 
The temperature level of the useful heat is the determining factor

the working ﬂuid in DASC leads to a signiﬁcant improvement in 
the overall performance of the system. This fact can be explained 
by  the  multi-absorption  of  the  scattered  radiation  by  nanoparti- 
cles  within  the  ﬂuid  as  well  as  thermal  losses  reduction.  Usual

Moreover, it has to be said that uncovered photovoltaic thermal 
provides higher exergy eﬃciency compared to cover ones because 
of  their  more  signiﬁcant  electricity  generation.  Also,  the  electri- 
cal yields increase with the increase in the nanoparticle concen- 
tration. This fact is mainly based on the increased thermal con- 
ductivity and consequently, the improved convective transfer coef- 
ﬁcient between the tube and the coolant. As a result, there is an 
enhancement in exergy performance. In this context, Abadeh et al. 
[372]  conducted  an  experimental  study  of  an  unglazed  thermal, 
photovoltaic  collector  using  water,  TiO 
3 / 
pure water, PVT/TiO 
3  as a cooling ﬂuid, 
and a conventional photovoltaic module (see Fig. 33 ). They com- 
pared  their  exergy  productions  under  the  climatic  conditions  of 
Mashhad (Iran). The annual production of electric and thermal en- 
ergy by the hybrid glass sensor is in the range of 221 kWh and 862 
kWh compared to 293 kWh and 1325 kWh provided by a classic 
photovoltaic module.

Table  5  represents  a  summary  of  the  recent  works  on  the 
exergy  enhancement  using  nanoﬂuids.  It  is  evident  that  the  re- 
searchers  emphasize the  exergy  eﬃciency  when  they  study  FPC, 
ETC, DASC, and PVT. It has to be commented that high exergy en- 
hancement has been found in the literature. For example, enhance- 
ment of about 60% has been found in Ref. [24] and 40% in Ref. 
[418] about FPC. Moreover, PVT high enhancements have been re- 
ported in Refs. [357] and [370] , for example. Generally, it has to be 
said that the use of nanoﬂuids is more effective in cases with high 
thermal losses because, in these cases, there is a higher thermal 
eﬃcient enhancement margin. Moreover, in PVT, the overall per- 
formance enhancement is high because there is both thermal and 
electrical enhancement. 

6. Effect of entropy on solar energy systems by using 
nanoﬂuids 

Entropy generation is a thermodynamic tool that aids in deter- 
mining how much every process is close to the ideal one. Low en- 
tropy generation means lower irreversibility and a process close to 
the ideal one. Bejan number is an index that aids in understand- 
ing the kind of entropy generation. It is deﬁned as the ratio of ir- 
reversibilities due to heat transfer to the total entropy generation 
and is deﬁned as Eq. (110) : 

Be =

ergy eﬃciency increasing [417] . 

of the exergetic output of the collector. A higher operating tem- 
perature level leads to a higher potential for work production and, 
consequently, higher exergetic factors. However, a higher operat- 
ing temperature means higher thermal losses, and this fact reduces 
the energy output. Therefore, there is usually an optimum operat- 
ing temperature for every collector type, which leads to the max- 
imization of its exergy eﬃciency. Moreover, it has to be said that 
the exergy input by the sun is approximately 93% of the solar en- 
ergy because the sun is a temperature reservoir of 5800 K. 

Exergy  analysis  of  energy  systems  can  be  referred  mainly  to 
the properties of the working ﬂuid, the operating temperature, and 
the  mass  ﬂow  rate.  Nanoﬂuids  are  ﬂuids  with  superior  thermal 
properties, and this fact indicates that they can present enhanced 
energy and exergy eﬃciency compared to the conventional base 
ﬂuids. Usually, nanoﬂuids present lower volumetric heat capacity 
than the conventional ﬂuids, which leads to a higher temperature 
increase  with  simultaneous  higher  thermal  and  exergetic  perfor- 
mance, something unique for creating an overall optimal conﬁgu- 
ration. Moreover, in the hybrid solar collectors (PVT), the use of 
nanoﬂuids leads to very effective cooling of the photovoltaic cell, 
something that leads to high electricity production and to signiﬁ- 
cant recovered heat rate; two factors which create high exergetic 
output.

1.1 kg of SO 2 can be achieved using 50 evacuated collectors with 
nanoﬂuids. 
- As solar radiation and nanoparticle concentration increased, the 
exergy eﬃciency improved. Whereas, increasing ﬂow rate 
reduces exergy eﬃciency. 
- A mixture of DIW with magnetite nanoparticles has maximum 
exergy eﬃciency, followed by a mixture of DIW with graphite 
then DIW with silver

power gain outlet temperature. The thermal eﬃciency of up to 
55% can be achieved without losing temperature gain. 
- Their numerical outcomes presented that the eﬃciency of

eﬃciency reached a maximum value of 90%. 
- The collector eﬃciency decreased as the irradiation time 
increased because of the increased heat loss.

better photo-thermal conversion eﬃciencies than the TiO 2 
nanoﬂuid since their absorption spectra are similar to the solar 
radiation spectrum. 
- Their numerical model has just a ±5% deviation from their 
experimental results. The collector eﬃciency was increased as 
volume fraction, and ﬂow rates of nanoﬂuids increased; however, 
this increase had an asymptotic trend. 
- Their results represent that zero-loss (maximum) eﬃciency of 
the collector for 90 l/h and nanoﬂuid with 100 ppm volume 
fraction was highest that the collector eﬃciency is about 29% 
more than that of using the base ﬂuid at similar ﬂowrate. 
The study results indicated that this new kind of collector could 
be best utilized in solar water heating applications.

- Optical and thermal conductivity characteristics of graphene 
nanoplatelets were studied as the working ﬂuid for 
low-temperature in DSAC applications. 
- Optical absorption and transmittance have been studied as a 
function of the nanoparticle concentration, and it is studied that 
the absorption increases by increasing weight percent and 
transmittance reduce. 
- An increase in nanoﬂuids weight percent reduces collector 
height indirect absorption collectors so that nanoﬂuids with 
weight percent 0.005 and 0.00025 can absorb solar energy in 
order of 2cm and 10 cm height. 
- It was determined that an increase in graphene nanoplatelets 
increases both the absorption coeﬃcient and conductivity of the 
nanoﬂuid. This increases the performance of the direct 
absorption of solar collectors. 
- The receiver eﬃciency increased with the solar concentration 
and receiver height but decreased with the graphene 
concentration. 
- The receiver eﬃciency could be maintained 0.7 under the 
conditions of 0.0005 wt.% of graphene in 5 cm receiver under 
20 ×1000 W m -2 
The collector eﬃciency with the black internal surface is about 
11.4% more than that of with reﬂective internal surface using the 
base ﬂuid at a 90 l/h ﬂow rate. The nanoﬂuids improved collector 
eﬃciency by 9–17% than the base ﬂuid. 
Their results showed different optical behaviors of the 
nanoﬂuids. In all measurements, the transmittance raised passing 
from visible to the infrared region, and in some cases, when the 
nanoparticles concentration is too low, the extinction distance 
increased to values more substantial than the typical diameter of 
a solar receiver. 
- The optical and thermophysical properties of CuO nanoﬂuid in 
DASC have been investigated. 
CuO nanoﬂuid could absorb energy 4 times more than base ﬂuid. 
- Thermal conductivity improvement of 13.7% was observed by 
100 ppm CuO nanoﬂuid. 
- Higher thermal conductivity and lower viscosity of CuO 
nanoﬂuids by increasing temperature, together with the 
appropriate optical properties, introduced this kind of nanoﬂuids 
as an appropriate candidate to enhance direct absorption solar 
collector eﬃciency effectively. 
DASC nanoﬂuid was more eﬃcient than water based. Various and 
coincident eﬃciency enhancements of 22.1%, 39.6%, 24.6% and 
18.75% have been estimated for about 0.001%, 0.005%, 0.01% and 
0.05% volume concentrations respectively.

In evaluating the Bejan number, it can be understood that when 
the share of ﬂuid friction in entropy generation is high, the Bejan 
number will be near to zero, and on the contrary, when this pro- 
portion is not as much, Bejan number is always near to one. Ac- 
cording to Fig. 34 , the Bejan number of all experimented cases on 
SiO 
2 -water, base ﬂuid in different ﬂow rates is close to one. This 
can result that the pressure drop, and ﬂuid friction do not have an 
essential role in entropy generation. 

It  needs  to  be  explained  that  the  term  η0 G t A c ( 1 
T 
P 

− 1 
)  has 
T 
S 
the most signiﬁcant contribution to the total entropy generation, 
which can be obtained from Eq. (68) . Thus, it can be concluded 
that an increase in solar radiation leads to an entropy generation 
rate to be increased. So, it can be concluded that using nanoﬂu- 
ids can decrease the entropy generation rate compared to the base 
ﬂuid because of the output temperature, and therefore the solar 
collector  plate  temperature  correspondence  to  the  base  ﬂuid  is 
lower than that of the nanoﬂuid-working solar collectors. So, the 
decreasing temperature of the plate merely increases entropy gen-

The size of nanoparticles and volume fraction of nanoﬂuids are 
other  factors  affecting  the  entropy  generation.  In  fact,  the  ther- 
mal  conductivity  of  nanoﬂuids,  which  is  dependent  on  Brown- 
ian motion and nanoparticle size and concentration, is an essen- 
tial  factor  in  heat  transfer  enhancement.  This  phenomenon  can 
decrease the entropy generation in  energy systems.  Under equal 
Reynolds number, the increase of nanoparticle concentration de- 
creases the Bejan number, which means the entropy generations 
due to the heat transfer decreases, whereas the entropy generation 
increases due to the ﬂuid friction. The increase in heat transfer of 
the nanoﬂuids is the increased nanoparticles’ thermal conductiv- 
ity,  which  increases  with  the  increasing  concentration,  therefore 
reducing the thermal irreversibility. However, simultaneously, the 
increased viscosity of nanoﬂuids results in increased irreversibil- 
ity owing to ﬂuid friction [433] . Therefore, both heat transfer and 
pumping power increase. Manipulation in the pH and mass ﬂow 
rate of nanoﬂuids are another two affecting parameters in entropy 
generation. Increasing pH and mass ﬂow rates can increase and de- 
crease the entropy generation, respectively [ 434 , 435 ].

7. Economic Analysis 

It is reported by Faizal et al. [337] that a signiﬁcant share of uti- 
lized glass and copper in the solar energy system can be cut as a 
result of the cooling ﬂuid with the use of nanoﬂuids. The utilized 
nanoparticles will then balance the overall investment in the en- 
ergy system. In fact, due to the variation of costs which is depen- 
dent on the local energy and governmental subsidies, the economic 
aspects of nanoﬂuids in the solar energy systems can be based on 
the following points [ 436 , 437 ]: 

• Electrical utilization of ﬂowing pumps. 
• Nanoﬂuids cost. 
• Annual maintenance costs can be set to the initial cost of 2%. 
• The annual interest rate of the initial cost and cumulative sav- 

ing is expected to be 2%. 

• Systems are supposed to generate electricity continuously (i.e., 

connected to the grid). 

In fact, based on the increasing trend of global investment in 
renewable energy and a decreasing trend in the prices of required 
equipment, the  cost  of  electricity  produced  by  solar  energy  sys- 
tems seems to be decreasing. Maadi et al. [437] represent a pay- 
back period of PVT systems using nanoﬂuids, which are presented 
in Fig. 35 . It can be understood that using nanoﬂuids and espe- 
cially ZnO/water nanoﬂuid, the long-term ﬁnancial performance is 
better than the pure water case. 

8. Environmental Impact

interest of energy and environmental scientists has signiﬁcantly in- 
creased the use of renewable from 2% in 1998 to 19.3% in 2015 
[439] . It is aimed that by the mid of the current century that 60% 
of the electricity and 40% of the direct fuel could be secured from 
renewable energy sources [ 439 , 440 ]. The solar usage of solar en- 
ergy, whether in FPC, ETC, and PVT has a positive impact on the 
environment where its usage improved the performance of the so- 
lar thermal and/or solar thermal/electrical conversions as the case 
of the PVT. That eventually will increase renewable energy and de- 
crease the dependence on the fossil fuel-based energies associated 
with gaseous harming the environment. 

In order to replace the consumption of fossil fuel with a sus- 
tainable energy source, there are various over-riding challenges for 
the energy sector, such as a surplus amount of energy supply and 
its impact upon the climate variations [438] . Therefore, the keen 

Among all these technologies, the nanoﬂuid based solar heaters 
are profoundly probed as it offers less space consumption by de- 
creasing the size of the heaters for the same capability as well as 
the green environmental effect of solar power consumption. More-

over, owing to unique thermophysical properties, such as thermal 
conductivity, speciﬁc heat capacity, viscosity, density, and convec- 
tive heat transfer coeﬃcients, nanoﬂuids have become an essential 
element for solar thermal engineering systems, including collectors 
and thermal energy storage systems [4 41-4 43] . From an environ- 
mental point of view, some researchers demonstrated that water- 
based nanoﬂuid is environmentally friendly in some applications, 
such as cutting tools where it will be used instead of the toxic and 
non-biodegradable oil-based cutting ﬂuid [ 4 4 4 , 4 45 ]. However, the 
usage of the nanoparticles to form the nanoﬂuids even in water 
may have some environmental concerns that will be the purpose 
of  this  section.  Besides,  in  this  section  promising  environmental 
beneﬁts and severe environmental concerns related to nanoﬂuid- 
based solar-powered renewable technologies are critically summa- 
rized. 

The environmental beneﬁts of Nano-ﬂuid based solar-powered 
technologies can be classiﬁed as less energy consumption during 
2 gas emission, and 
manufacturing, a considerable reduction in CO 
fuel  savings  [446] .  One  crucial  part  of  using  nanoﬂuid  is  that  a 
large part of the solar collector material is replaced by stainless 
steel and glass instead of copper (see Fig. 36 ), and hence reducing 
the  energy  consumption  (by  200  MJ)  during  manufacturing  that 
2 equivalent emissions during the manufacturing 
saves 34 kg of CO 
stage [ 4 43 , 4 47 ]. 

For instance, Otanicar and Golden [447] carried out an environ- 
mental comparison between conventional and nanoﬂuid-based so- 
lar collectors in Phoenix, Arizona. The nanoﬂuid based solar collec- 
tors demonstrated higher solar energy usage eﬃciency and lower 
exergy  destruction.  During  15  years’  operation  of  the  nanoﬂuid 
based  solar  collectors,  it  could  eliminate  a  CO 
2  release  to  the 
environment by 740 Kg compared to the conventional solar col- 
2  compared  to  fossil  fuel- 
lector  and  more  than  230 0 0  kg  of  CO 
based heaters. Moreover, they showed that the nanoﬂuid-based so- 
lar  collector  usage  by  50%  of  the  residents  of  Phoenix,  Arizona, 
a 1,0 0 0,0 0 0-metric ton of CO 
2  would be reduced annually. Like- 
wise, a considerable reduction in gas emission is also remarkably 
noticed, Faizal et al. [ 4 48 , 4 49 ] demonstrated that using nanoﬂuid

2 emissions by 32% kgCO 

based FPC, resulted in decreasing the size of the solar collector (for 
the same energy) with a 170 kg CO 
2 reduction during the manu- 
facturing compared to conventional solar collectors. The applica- 
tion of a nanoﬂuid-based PVT system reduced the emission by 17% 
compared  to  conventional  PVT  [450] .  In  a  similar  study  on  PVT, 
Hassani et al. [371] examined that the application of the nanoﬂuid- 
based PVT caused a decrease in the annual emissions of CO 
2  by 
2 eq m -2 . Similar results were reported by Tiwari et al. 
448 kg CO 
3 based nanoﬂuid in the FPC 
[349] , where the application of Al 
heat exchanger reduced the CO 
2 per kWh 
compared to the conventional ﬂat plate solar heaters. The survey 
done by Khullar and Tyagi [443] demonstrated that the usage of 
the nanoﬂuid based concentrated heaters would save the annual 
energy of 1716 kWh/household that can come from fossil fuel (liq- 
ueﬁed petroleum gas ), and thus reducing the annual emissions of 
CO 

2 by 2,200 kg. 
Tong  et  al.  [443]  revealed  that  the  application  of  evacuated 
U  tube  using  multiwall  carbon  nanotubes  (MWCNTs)  nanoﬂuid 
would reduce the annual emissions of CO 
2 by 32.3 kg and 
0.105 kg, respectively and would reach to 1600 kg and 5.3 kg, re- 
spectively, in case of using 50 units of the nanoﬂuid based solar 
collectors. Recently, Kim et al. [386] demonstrated that among dif- 
2 , and CuO based nanoﬂuids in U tube 
ferent Al 
solar collector, MWCNTs with 0.2 vol.% demonstrated the best per- 
formance of 63% eﬃciency that would decrease the annual emis- 
sions  of  CO 
2  by  6.906,  kg,  and  0.022  kg,  respectively, 
compared  to  the  conventional  based  solar  heater.  Based  on  the 
usage of  50 units of  the solar heaters in Gwangju, South  Korea, 
the  nanoﬂuid  based  solar  heaters  would  reduce  the  annual  coal 
2  pro- 
usage by 792.1 kg, and thus a reduction in the annual CO 
duction by 2083.1 kg and an annual reduction of the SO 
2  emis- 
sions by 6.7 kg. In another study, Abadeh et al. [450] demonstrated 
that nanoﬂuid usage increased electrical eﬃciency by 7%. The ap- 
plying of PVT/ZnO nanoﬂuid resulted in increasing decreasing the 
material by 33% compared to 21% in the case of water baseﬂuid. 
Also, the emissions in the form of CO 
3 , and CO are

life, which can be transferred to the human being on consump- 
tion [465–471] . Fig. 38 summarizes the effect of the nanomaterials 
(ENM) on aquatic life, especially the case of the bivalve mollusks. 
Kim et al. demonstrated that the nanoparticles of small size less 
than 10 nm could accumulate in the liver tissues of Zebra ﬁshes 
[472] . Also, Brittle et al. reported that the nanoparticles could ac- 
cumulate in the shrimp’s body that in turn, can harm the end con- 
sumer [473] . 

Some  researchers  proposed  a  different  method  to  minimize 
and/or eliminate the side effects of such effects. Akhavan–Behabadi 
et al. [474] recommended recycling of the CNTs used as nanoﬂu- 
ids to avoid the severe problems that could happen upon inhal- 
ing. Similarly, Ranjbarzadeh et al. [475] demonstrated that the us- 
age of nano-silica derived from rice husks (environmental friendly 
synthesis  of  nanomaterial)  is  an  excellent  example  of  the  usage 
of eco-friendly nanomaterials that derived from renewable waste 
(agriculture residue) with no environmental impact and with the 
high enhancement of the heat transfer that reached 33% (at 55 °C 
using 3% volume fraction). Prober selection of nanoparticles plays a 
role in their recycling; for instance, Said et al. [476] recommended 
CuO-based nanoﬂuid instead of Cu as the later tends to bound to 
the environment, and thus it is diﬃcult to get rid of it. 

9. Energy, Exergy, Economic and Environmental effect of solar 
combination system in the building 

Thermal energy is the slowly consumed form of energy by the 
human population, such as 40% of the building’s total energy in 
the  US  is  based  upon  thermal  energy.  Traditionally,  thermal  en- 
ergy is produced by fossil fuel combustion as a low-temperature 
heat  source  for  residential  applications,  including  space  heating 
and  hot  water.  Fossil  fuel-based  thermal  energy  sources  are  the 
apparent cause of increased greenhouse gas emissions and fossil 
fuel depletion. Therefore, signiﬁcant efforts have been devoted to 
exploring  geothermal  and  solar  energy  as  renewable  sources  for 
heat and power production. Thence, solar combination system is 
being keenly investigated for indoor space heating of residential 
buildings [477-481] . Such type of combined solar system generally 
consists of solar collectors, one or more water tanks (T) to stock 
the generated energy, an auxiliary heating source, a heat delivery 
system (often UFRH) and controls, where solar collector’s position- 
ing, orientation, and inclination are of primary concern for the op- 
timum energy yield. For instance, a steeply inclined solar collec- 
tor geometry may be useful in avoiding stagnation during summer, 
whilst maximizing the solar yield during the heating period. Like- 
wise, the required water store size is also crucial for lower capital 
costs with minimal heat losses; therefore, it is necessary to decide 
its location within the building. The water store location is mainly 
related to the distribution piping length from solar collectors to the 
store (Collector Loop) and from the store to the manifolds of the 
UFRH (Heating Loop). Thence, the boiler room, especially the water 
storage, are the main elements for integrating the piping network 
into the building. 

In this regard, Katsaprakakis and Zidianakis [482] assessed the 
hybrid power plants consists of solar ﬂat plate collectors, thermal 
energy  storage  for  water  tanks,  and  biomass  heater  for  thermal 
energy production for the indoor space heating loads ( Fig. 39 A). 
An  optimization  was  applied  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  the 
existing thermal energy storage capacity and, ﬁnally, the thermal 
power generation by solar collectors. The results of this study re- 
vealed that this hybrid solar combination could provide 100% of 
the heat load of the case study, at least for the south of Europe 
climate. Moreover, this hybrid system’s cost of produced electricity 
was about 0.154 €/kWh that it was competitive with other conven- 
tional power generation systems. This cost was less than the price 
of diesel fuel for this school’s central heater, which was calculated

based solar collectors [158] .

spectively,  based  on  100  m 2  of  the  PVT.  Tayor  et  al.  reported  a 
10% increase in eﬃciency in the case of using the nanoﬂuid so- 
lar  collector  in  solar  thermal  power  plants  that  would  result  in 
100 MW energy conservation in Tucson-Arizona [451] that is, in 
turn, saves the environment from emitted gases such as CO 
2 . Sim- 
ilar conclusions were reported, such as the case of CuO nanoparti- 
cles in ﬂat plate solar in the micro solar-geothermal CCHP system 
[452] , MgO/water nanoﬂuid in ﬂat solar collector [453] , and Al 
2 O 
3 
3 based nanoﬂuid in parabolic trough solar thermal power 
and Fe 
plant [454] . However, the usage of the nanoparticles to form the 
nanoﬂuids in such a system may have some environmental con- 
cerns which are needed to be discussed thoroughly. Such environ- 
mental concerns of the nanoﬂuidic systems are arisen because of 
the synthetic procedure and physicochemical features of nanoma- 
terials [ 26 , 446 ]. The unique physicochemical features of nanoma- 
terials, such as its surface area and size, are of primary environ- 
mental concern more than its composition. Because of possessing 
tremendous  surface  energy,  nanomaterials  are  highly  reactive  to 
penetrate rapidly within the human body and thus causing damage 
to the vital organs [455-457] . Well, this aspect of nanotechnology 
is still under discussion by the research community such as Said 
et al. [26] reported that the primary concern of the used material 
is their size that is usually lower than 100 nm, and thus it can be 
inhaled by the human beings causing a severe problem (damage) 
for the lungs, and thus a proper safety protocol must be applied. 

The  release  of  nanoparticles  in  the  atmosphere  during  their 
preparation  or  usage  would  result  in  severe  health  problems  in 
the case of inhaling with human bodies or other mammals. The 
inhaled nanoparticles in the human body can reach the blood and 
thus results in severe problems such as toxicity of the lungs, skin, 
liver, brain, and other organs [ 458 , 459 ]. These nanoparticles have 
a destructive effect on the DNA, mitochondria, cell membrane, and 
causing oxidative stress, as can be simply represented by the fol- 
lowing schematic diagram ( Fig. 37 ). 

Gutwein and Webster reported that nanoparticles result in sup- 
pressing cell growth [461] . Also, Pernodet et al. reported that less 
than 14 nm nanoparticles penetrate the cell membrane, causing se- 
vere health issues [462] . Moreover, Hany and Shaw [463] demon- 
strated that high concentrations of the nanoparticles could result 
in attacking the immune system, oxidative-stress-release disorders, 
and even brain damage. Additionally, small nanosized particles can 
deposit in the olfactory mucosa and thus reach the brain cortex 
through the olfactory nerves [464] . 

When the nanoﬂuid is discharged in water streams such as sea 
and rivers, the particular concern must be given to the effect of 
such nanoparticles on aquatic life. Several researchers have already 
summarized the effect of the discharge of nanomaterials on aquatic 
life, insisting on the toxicity of such nanoparticles on the aquatic

as 0.157 €/kWh. Zuhur et al. [483] studied the energy, exergy, and 
environmental impact of a newly designed prototype based on a 
Concentrated  Photovoltaic  Cooling  System  ( Fig.  39 B).  A  diffusion 
absorption refrigerator system was utilized for eﬃcient cooling in 
the system. The diffusion absorption refrigerator system works on 
the thermic compressor principle, where a thermal mechanism en- 
hances the pressure of the refrigerant instead of a compressor used 
for  increasing  the  pressure  of  the  coolant  in  compressive  steam 
systems. This system aimed to supply the needed electricity and 
cooling of a building on a hot summer day. It had been observed 
the thermal energy gain was not affected considerably because of 
the concentrator, and total thermal energy gain was calculated as 
approximately 30 W in the system, although the use of a concen- 
trator  increased  the  exergy  eﬃciency.  Moreover,  the  lower  elec- 
trical performance due to the concentrator can be referred to as 
the increase in panels’ backside temperature. In the present case, a 
concentrated photovoltaic cooling system was based on concentra- 
tors with a theoretical concentration ratio of around 2.4. Accord- 
ing to its basic working principle, the concentrated solar radiation 
was  converted  into  electrical  energy  via  the  photovoltaic  panel, 
whereas some of this energy was used to operate the absorption 
refrigerator, and some were stored in the battery. The economic 
evaluation  of  the  system  revealed  that  the  economic  revenue  of 
this system was 0.1$ per hour due to the reduction of CO 
2 . More- 
over, it has been noticed that due to the speciﬁc geometry con- 
centrator, the concentration coeﬃcient for the inclined panel was 
around  1.18-times  hours  when  the  sun  rays  arrived  perpendicu- 
larly. The hybrid uses of cooler/concentrator increased the exergy 
eﬃciency from 6% to 11% with the concentrator. The thermal eﬃ- 
ciency of the hybrid system was 5%; the electrical eﬃciency was 
about 10% and 11% with and without concentrator, respectively. 

In order to increase the electrical eﬃciency and working tem- 
perature of PV by utilizing the additional heat and to produce heat 
and electricity simultaneously for advantageous purposes such as 
for  fruit  and  crop  drying,  textile  production,  heating  of  building 
and spaces, regenerative of the cooling agent, the concept of a hy- 
brid photovoltaic thermal collector called PVT collector [4 84 , 4 85] . 
It has been found that in a PV system, absorption of solar pho- 
tons for electricity generation may increase the collector temper- 
ature up to 80 o C, and as a result, the power output decreases to 

0.4 to 0.6 for one temperature degree. The thermal evaluation of 
different solar collectors including; photovoltaic thermal collector 
(PVT) water and air collector, PVT with refrigerant and heat pipe 
base, concentrating and transpired PVT, and other parabolic collec- 
tors have been reported broadly. The study revealed that PVT water 
collectors had a better performance than PVT air collectors due to 
more density, better heat capacity, and better thermal conductivity 
of the water [486] . Barhim and Jemni [487] presented a detailed 
study on the history, recent advancements, and challenges, partic- 
ularly for performance and cost-effectiveness for the PVT system 
for several purposes. The cooling system of PVT was also classi- 
ﬁed based on working ﬂuid and the number of phases for work- 
ing ﬂuid. Numerous researchers presented a general type of cool- 
ing system for ﬂat plate PVT solar system for both water and air 
as a working ﬂuid individually and a hybrid of both. The eﬃciency 
of electricity and thermal generation in PVT for different conﬁgu- 
rations of cooling systems for water as the working ﬂuid are pre- 
sented in Table 6 . 

The amount of electricity can estimate the photovoltaic/thermal 
(PVT)  collector  performance  in  comparison  to  the  useful  energy 
from  the  collector,  which  is  a  crucial  part.  PVT  collector  perfor- 
mance can be evaluated by exergy eﬃciency. It is said by increas- 
ing  exergy  due  to  thermal  energy  of  around  2–3%,  an  increase 
for  12%  for  the  electrical  exergy  from  a  PVT  system,  and  over- 
all exegetic eﬃciency for about 14–15% [4 96 , 4 97] . The economic 
study  of  hybrid  PVT  collectors  can  be  conducted  through  differ- 
ent aspects such as payback time (PBT) of the system covering the 
equipment installation and operational charges, energy costs, and 
economic Figures, like ﬁnancial prices mortgages, or rate of inﬂa- 
tion. Likewise, energy reimbursement duration is related to an in- 
tegral time interval, which is required to improve the overall con- 
sumed energy consumed on material preparation of the systems. 
Besides, lifecycle analysis and life cycle savings (LCS) can also be 
done  to  achieve  the  total  cost  or  life  cycle  cost  and  of  systems 
[ 4 98 , 4 99 , 500 , 501 ].  Moreover,  economic  parameters  vary  the  fol- 
lowing time and geographic area. Evola and Marletta [502] com- 
puted the thermal energy cost produced by a water PVT collec- 
tor,  ranging  from  1  to  10  c €/kW  h,  for  an  expected  amount  of 
power from 0.18 to 0.24 €/kWh. However, it was mentioned that 
there was a lack of research on the following topics: (a) Techno-

economical optimization of the different existing conﬁguration of 
PVT systems, (b) Feasibility study of exiting PVT for different appli- 
cation more speciﬁc in domestic application, and (c) A long-term 
and environmental study of exiting PVT systems. Furthermore, the 
core  content  of  the  PVT  system  that  is  the  phase  change  mate- 
rial  is  analyzed  deeply  by  Hossain  et  al.  [503] .  They  developed 
PV/thermal-phase change materials (PVT-PCM) technique and ana- 
lyzed performance of energy, exergy and as well as economic per- 
formance shown in Fig. 40 . PCM such as Lauric acid enclosed in 
sealed aluminum foil packages are employed across the ﬂow chan- 
nel  to  allow  prolonged  period  for  thermal  storage.  The  thermal, 
electrical, and exergy eﬃciencies for the PVT-PCM  was observed 
to be a maximum of 87.72% at 2 lpm, 11.08% (4 lpm), and 12.19% 
(0.5 lpm) respectively. Electrical eﬃciency and exergy eﬃciency for 
PV have been found to be a maximum of 9.88% and 7.09%, respec- 
tively. The results represent that the PVT-PCM systems are more 
cost-effective and attractive than the PV system working individ- 
ually in the long run; thus, it is beneﬁcial for the family to use a 
solar water heater that can use up to at least 5 years. Phase change 
materials (PCM) are substances that maintain the high heat of fu- 
sion, which can store (or discharge) energy in a large amount as 

latent heat during their freezing (or melting) process, the heat is 
obtained from the environment [ 504 , 505 , 506 , 507 , 508 ]. When the 
environmental temperature of a solid PCM approaches its melting 
point, it absorbs heat from the ambient, gets melted, and stores it 
as latent heat if the temperature is above its melting point. The 
decrease in electrical eﬃciency is due to the increased tempera- 
ture of the cell is less noticeable in photovoltaic thermal systems, 
particularly for the PVT-PCM system because PCMs can have bet- 
ter control over the cell temperature rise by its natural capacity to 
absorb heat through alternative melt or freeze periods at selective 
temperatures. In a similar manner, the effect of Myristic acid 51 as 
PCM on the environmental aspect of solar systems is further an- 
alyzed by Mote et al. [509] . The comparison of electrical, thermal 
and exergy eﬃciency on PV and PVT-PCEM collector is summarized 
in Table 7 . 

Concentrated  solar  power  is  being  converted  eﬃciently  into 
thermal, electrical,  and chemical energy. The  conversion of  solar 
heat into high temperature endothermic chemical reactions is clas- 
siﬁed as solar thermochemical processes which are of great inter- 
est in solar-based technology system [508,510–515] . The three pos- 
sible ways are depicted in Fig. 41 for eﬃcient utilization of col-

lected Solar power and concentrated within a solar utility (1) PV 
systems for conversion of sunlight into electricity for the decom- 
position of inert chemical sorts such as water or carbon dioxide 
to  suitable  fuels;  (2)  photoelectrochemical  and  (3)  photothermal 
systems may be used to heat ﬂuids or to cause required chemi- 
cal reactions. These strategies are found to produce environmen- 
tally friendly solar fuels that present effective manufacture, ade- 
quate energy density, and ﬂexible transformation into heat, elec- 
trical, or mechanical energy. A new comprehensive distributed en- 
ergy system consisted of a solar thermochemical process with a 
double-axis tracking parabolic trough collector that was studied by 
Fang and his colleagues [516] to supply solar energy into fuel pro- 
duction. This hybrid system had applied for an oﬃce building in 
China to supply electricity, heating, and cooling loads successfully. 
The solar to fuel production and solar to electricity generation of 
the proposed system increased 27% more power to building rel- 
ative to the reference case, and this more power generation was 
kept almost the same for all variation of the seasons. 

An in-depth analysis related to the thermal and electrical per- 
formances  of  the  hybrid  photovoltaic  thermal  collector  (PVT)  in 
terms  of  collector  design,  double-ﬂow  air  solar  heater  collector 
with and without different obstacles on absorber plate, nature of 
PCM material, solar irradiance, air temperature, and numerous fac- 
tors such as optimum mass ﬂow rate of the working ﬂuid, packing 
factor and other speciﬁcations of the collector including tube spac- 
ing, absorption property of the plate, tube diameter, ﬁn thickness 
and has been reported [518] . Some of the essential results of this 
study could be summarized as (a) In general, the PVT solar col- 
lector generates more power per unit area relative to the PV col- 
lector. (b) a solar water collector is more eﬃcient than a solar air 

56 

collector. (c) Unglazed PVT solar collector had better electrical per- 
formance relative to a glazed PVT solar collector. Contrary to the 
thermal and electrical eﬃciencies, the environmental assessment 
of solar collector is highly inﬂuenced by the solar collector area, 
the absorbed solar radiation, and life-cycle assessment (LCA) data 
[519] . Among different solar-powered technologies [520] , the dis- 
trict energy (DE) system associated with thermal energy storage 
(TES)  has  marked  excellent  performance.  The  comparison  of  ex- 
ergy analysis of district energy (DE) system versus a combination 
of (DE) and thermal energy storage (TES) were revealed that ex- 
ergy eﬃciency varies from 23% to 27%, and total energy eﬃciency 
changes from 83% to 87%. The increased eﬃciency of (TES) can be 
referred to as the reduced heat loss and more absorption of solar 
energy by the collector. Moreover, the comparison of district heat- 
ing systems powered by renewable energy resources versus other 
fossil fuel systems revealed that the hybrid combination of renew- 
able energies, including solar and geothermal sources were more 
adequate than high-temperature energy resources [ 521 , 522 ]. 

Karegarsharifabad et al. [523] examined the integration of so- 
lar collectors in combination with heat pipes to supply needed en- 
ergy in the building and compared the exergy eﬃciency of pul- 
sating heat pipe with ﬂat plate solar collectors with conventional 
solar  collectors  in  an  experimental  rig.  Their  study  revealed  nu- 
merous facts related to increased energy and exergy eﬃciencies, 
such as (a) intense solar radiation has a negligible effect on the 
energy loss, and consequently, exergy eﬃciency increases. (b) At 
minimal heat losses, the increased optical eﬃciency of the collec- 
tor ampliﬁes the energy and exergy eﬃciencies. (c) The tempera- 
ture difference between the collector and the ambient has an op- 
timal point for exergy eﬃciency. In short, high-performance PHP 
may lead the increased energy and exergy eﬃciencies because of 
the optimum heat transfer coeﬃcient and low heat losses to the 
ambient. All these good results are referred to as simplicity, non- 
twisting structure, and independence from gravity, and high eﬃ- 
ciency [524–527] . 

Al-Waeli  et  al.  [357]  probed  the  thermophysical  attributes  of 
nanoﬂuid consisted of water and SiC nanoparticles without the use

60% with nanoparticle diameter of 45 nm [528] . 

an  increase  in  the  resulting  ﬂuid  density  up  to  0.0082%  and  an 
increase  of  viscosity  by  up  to  1.8%  and  hence  the  thermal  con- 
ductivity was increased up to 8.2% within the temperature limit 
25 o C–60 o C.  Besides,  the  synthesized  nanoﬂuid  was  stable  under 
these conditions for 6 months. The use of 3 wt% SiC nanoﬂuid in- 
creased the electrical eﬃciency up to 24.1% in comparison of bare 
PV system alone, and an increment up to 100.19% for thermal ef- 
ﬁciency  in  comparison  of  water  for  cooling.  Moreover,  they  also 
highlighted that the performance of the nanoﬂuid-based PVT sys- 
tem is inﬂuenced by the nature of base nanomaterial used, mix- 
ing method, and mixing time. Yazdanifard et al. [528] presented a 
comprehensive study related to the features, structures, and eﬃ- 
ciencies of nanoﬂuid-based PVT systems, in both laminar and tur- 
bulent regimes. Moreover, they anticipated the effects of nanoﬂuid 
parameters such as volume fraction (0–4%), size (21 nm and 100 
nm), and type of nanoparticles (TiO 
3 ), type of base ﬂuid 
(water and mixture of ethylene glycol-water). This study supported 
a few facts such as (a) better performance of concluded nanoparti- 
cles in the laminar regime as compared to turbulent (b) nanopar- 
ticles with larger diameter cause an increase in energy and exergy 
eﬃciency in the turbulent regime while conﬂicting performance is 
observed in laminar ﬂow. Table 8 presents the thermal and elec- 
trical eﬃciencies of the PVT having different attributes of nanopar- 
ticle and volume fraction. Likewise, the signiﬁcant features of ad- 
vanced solar-powered technologies are summarized in Table 9 .

Sheikholeslami et al. [529] designed an accelerated process for 
clean energy storage where a porous foam is inserted considering 
nanoparticles with paraﬃn for higher heat transfer. Results showed 
that  using  the  porous  foam  results  in  expediting  the  solidiﬁca- 
tion paraﬃn time by 21.4% and showed higher eﬃciency. Future 
works utilizing such systems for heat-absorbing during the melt- 
ing process can be utilized based on the study conducted. Different 
conﬁgurations with inclined air gaps for the airway passage can 
be investigated. Xiaojie et al. [530] investigated the effect of CuO 
nanoparticles for solidiﬁcation inside a clean energy storage unit 
using PCM. The authors reported enhanced performance using CuO 
nanoparticles, therefore, improving the solidiﬁcation rate, and the 
effect was more pronounced inside a sinusoidal surface. The en- 
tropy generation is reduced, and the discharging process is boosted 
using the nanoparticles. Sheikholeslami et al. [531] conducted an 
experimental study investigating the effect of nano-refrigerant for 
boiling heat transfer enhancement. Results showed that improving 
the % of the ﬂat area and increasing the nanoparticle concentration 
improved the heat transfer coeﬃcient. Various nanoparticles with

PCM. Based on the study, some future investigations could be the 
effect of various platelet shapes and other nanoparticles suspended 
in PCM for evaluating the performance. 

10. Challenges and outlook 

One  of  the  main  challenges  of  using  nanoﬂuids  in  solar  col- 
lector  systems  is  the  high  cost  of  the  nanoparticles.  The  stabil- 
ity  of  nanoﬂuids,  especially  in  heat  transfer  applications,  is  an- 
other drawback and requires an in-depth analysis of the different 
nanoparticles and their reactions as well as stability in different 
base ﬂuids concerning time for effective long-term results. Most of 
the studies reported in the literature show the enhanced and im- 
proved nanoﬂuid characteristics for a short period. However, lim- 
ited studies up to date have been conducted showing the enhanced 
properties of nanoﬂuids and their consistency after a long period 
[ 37 , 82 , 537 ]. Another drawback is the increased viscosity, which is 
due to the high density of the nanoparticles, which are added to 
the base ﬂuid [ 19 , 538 , 539 ]. The preparation of stable suspensions 
of  nanoﬂuids  requires  high-end  cutting  technology,  which  is  ex- 
pensive and, at the same time-consuming. No benchmarking has 
been reported up to date on the toxicity of the different nanopar- 
ticles used for different applications, the steps required, or neces- 
sary for their disposal [ 441 , 540 ]. This increase in viscosity results 
in increased pressure drop, therefore demanding higher pumping 
power for the systems. 

The  primary  strategy  to  achieve  well-dispersed  nanoﬂuids  is 
centered  upon  the  development  of  the  synthetic  procedure.  It 
has  been  observed  that  solvent  assisted  wet  mixing  has  a  bet- 
ter  effect  than  a  direct  dry  mixing  method,  and  shear  mixing 
is also helpful. Along with good dispersion and thermal stability, 
the eﬃcacious heat transfer ability can be achieved through ad- 

vanced  surface  modiﬁcations,  as  found  in  polymer  nanocompos- 
ites  [ 11 , 37 , 441 , 541 , 542 ].  Many  researchers  have  used  surfactants 
for the stability of nanoﬂuids, which is one of the recommended 
methods regarding stability. However, surfactants cannot withstand 
higher  temperatures,  due  to  their  lower  melting  point  tempera- 
ture,  affecting  the  stability  at  higher  working  temperatures.  The 
stability of the nanoﬂuids is one of the signiﬁcant factors which 
is inﬂuenced by several operating parameters such as temperature, 
salinity, structure, shear rate, conﬁnement, external magnetic, com- 
patibility between base ﬂuid, and nanoparticle, and electrical ﬁeld 
[537] . Based on the application, the nanoﬂuids material and prepa- 
ration technique should be selected. Hydrophilic nanoparticles are 
easily dispersed in a polar solvent such as metal oxide, whereas 
hydrophobic nanoparticles are preferred in non-polar solvents such 
as graphene and carbon nanotube. Further investigations should be 
performed on a hybrid stabilization technique in which different 
mechanical and chemical methods are employed at different oper- 
ating conditions to improve the stability of the nanoﬂuids. There 
are  several  investigations  on  electrostatic  and  steric  stabilization 
techniques compared to electrosteric stabilization [81] . More stud- 
ies on electrosteric stabilization techniques should be investigated 
to  enhance  the  stability  and  performance  of  nanoﬂuids  applica- 
tions. In contrast to other nanoﬂuids, hybrid nanoﬂuids are con- 
sidered promising due to their excellent physical properties. The 
investigations on the stability of hybrid nanoﬂuids are limited in 
literature, and further studies will improve its potential for large- 
scale  applications.  Therefore,  while  developing  the  mono/hybrid 
nanoﬂuids, the chemical bonding for surface modiﬁcation should 
be robust enough to tolerate high operating temperatures [543] . 

The  variations  in  viscosity  and  thermal  conductivity  make  it 
hard  to  obtain  precise  design  value  and  variation  rule.  Such 
nanoﬂuid  characteristics  are  not  aﬃrmatory  and  assessable  as 
compared to the conventional ﬂuid. The variation trends and per- 
formance rate determined by temperature or nanoparticle concen- 
tration  are  indeﬁnite.  The  pre-experiment  is  one  of  the  promis- 
ing methods for the nanoﬂuid application. There is a lack of re- 
search on thermophysical properties such as viscosity and thermal 

58

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100898 

conductivity  due  to  clustering,  collision,  and  microstructure.  The 
fundamental importance of dynamic and sustainable features for 
the long-standing nanoﬂuid applications is of utmost signiﬁcance 
in a circulatory system. The studies on viscosity and thermal con- 
ductivity inﬂuenced by a surfactant are vague and a challenge for 
future  investigations.  Many  scholars  mention  that  surfactant  ad- 
dition increases the dispersion but results in intensiﬁed viscosity 
and reduction in thermal conductivity. Some studies show a reduc- 
tion in viscosity and a rise in thermal conductivity with the addi- 
tion of surfactants. The analysis modeling for thermal conductivity 
and viscosity of nanoﬂuids imprecisely measures the microscopic 
nanoparticle factors such as collision, clustering, and charge distri- 
bution. The uncertainty causes severe diﬃculties in heat transfer 
applications due to the impacts on dimensionless numbers such 
as Nu, Re, and Pr numbers [ 249 , 250 ]. The nanoparticle clustering 
results in enhanced thermal conductivity and in sedimentation. In- 
vestigation on limiting the clustering to avoid sedimentation is re- 
quired to obtain excellent thermal conductivity to ﬁll the gap in 
research. It is practical to achieve outstanding thermal conductiv- 
ity  and  low  viscosity  nanoﬂuids  by  considering  parameters  like 
nanomaterial type, surfactant, and synthesis technique for a poten- 
tial application. Another critical challenge for properties is time- 
dependence,  modelling  for  viscosity  and  thermal  conductivity  of 
nanoﬂuids which requires attention and is a gap for future work. 
The sustainable and dynamic properties of nanoﬂuids are of great 
importance for long-term applications. The time-dependent prop- 
erties are considered unstable due to cluster formation and various 
nanoparticles collision. 

For heat transfer applications [544-546] , pressure drop, friction 
factor, the effect of ﬂow rate (Re), and particle concentration and 
fouling  factor  along  with  thermal  properties  at  different  operat- 
ing conditions should be considered in the heat exchanger, heat 
pipe,  thermosyphon,  and  microchannel.  High  concentration  and 
ﬂow rate increase the pressure drop and fouling effect. The sub- 
strate  properties  need  more  technical  investigation  affecting  the 
stability of nanoﬂuids in microﬂuidic applications because of the 
wall effect. Oil-based nanoﬂuids possess outstanding friction-drop 
properties because of the growth of the viscous ﬁlm layer between 
two  surfaces  and  minimal  evaporative  behavior  as  compared  to 
water-based nanoﬂuids. The lubrication effect of nanoﬂuid is no- 
ticeable for rough surfaces. Limited literature is accessible on the 
techno-economic performance of nanoﬂuid, the effect of stability 
at high pressure, which has importance in increased oil develop- 
ment and hydrate formation applications. The next few years will 
be  crucial  for  scholars  and  researchers  to  enhance  the  stability 
of  heat  transfer  ﬂuids  by  decreasing  the  particle  size  ( < 10 -9  or 
< 10 -12 ) and to implement it in industrial applications. 

Limited  studies  have  been  reported  showing  the  erosion  and 
corrosion  of  the  nanoﬂuids  in  systems  [ 37 , 547 ].  More  corrosion 
and erosion studies are needed to be carried out to show the long- 
term  effect  of  the  nanoﬂuids  on  the  solar  systems  compared  to 
the  conventional  coolants.  Therefore,  standardized  guidelines  are 
required  for  the  preparation  of  nanoﬂuids  that  can  be  useful  in 
normalizing the experimental results reported by different research 
groups. A proper assessment of nanoﬂuids before and after being 
used in the system is essential based on standardized guidelines. 
In-depth investigational and theoretical investigations need to be 
carried out to help understand the most contributing parameters 
preciously  in  the  nanoﬂuids’  performance.  The  contradiction  has 
been reported both in the numerical and experimental investiga- 
tions reported by different research groups [ 548 , 549 ]. The key to 
explaining this disagreement could be a precise and detailed ex- 
perimental procedure of nanoﬂuids following a speciﬁc established 
standardized approach. The traditional models for thermal conduc- 
tivity and viscosity do not provide approximation with precision 
for  hybrid-based  nanoﬂuids  as  well.  General  correlations  are  re- 

quired today that can be employed for all kinds of hybrid nanoﬂu- 
ids and other novel materials, under extensive factors. Lastly, more 
studies  are  required  to  explain  the  physical  mechanism  of  heat 
transfer of nanoﬂuids and the contributing parameters. In order to 
decrease the uncertainty between the homogenous models and the 
experimental information, temperature-dependent thermophysical 
characteristics should be considered. More physical phenomenon 
are considered in the two-phase models compared to the single- 
phase homogenous models, therefore resulting in closer agreement 
to the experimental data; however, it is widely known that the de- 
viations of the mathematical modeling from the experimental data 
is due to the various types of uncertainties such as the aggrega- 
tion/sedimentations and the uncertainty of experimental measure- 
ments. 

Using nanoﬂuids in solar collectors have shown promising re- 
sults in increasing the collector’s eﬃciency [ 294 , 333 , 550 ]. However, 
the major challenge still lies in the cost reduction of the solar sys- 
tem so that this technology can be used effectively for both do- 
mestic and industrial applications. Further studies are required to 
show the effect of nanoparticles in the base ﬂuid using a dynamic 
modeling approach. Different volume fractions are required to be 
investigated for different nanoﬂuids to establish the optimal vol- 
ume fraction for different solar collectors. Performance evaluation 
criteria should be applied to show if the nanoﬂuids are favorable 
or unfavorable, considering the enhanced heat transfer. More work 
should be carried out on preparing functionalized nanoparticles to 
be used in base ﬂuids as they are more promising both regard- 
ing long-term stability as well as effective at higher temperatures 
[82] .  Limited  studies  have  been  reported  using  hybrid  nanoﬂu- 
ids for heat transfer enhancement in solar collectors, which could 
open  doors  for  the  new  research  area  [551] .  Furthermore,  more 
optimizing and system design analysis efforts are needed to de- 
termine the energy and exergy eﬃciencies of nanoﬂuid-based so- 
lar collectors. Flat plate collectors hold the most signiﬁcant portion 
in the solar thermal collector for low-temperature applications, as 
predicted by the latest ﬁndings which present the progress more 
precisely.  There  is  an  analytical  concern  of  ﬂuid  ﬂow  conﬁgura- 
tion in the dynamic behavior of Flat plate collector where it should 
be arranged with the lowest possible pressure drop. Anti-reﬂection 
coating is desirable for glass covers to obtain remarkable thermal 
performance of the absorber material. The introduction of PCMs is 
considered more promising in solar collectors to improve the per- 
formance as well as operational ﬂexibility by resolving the heating 
and cooling issues in extreme weather. The vacuum in Evacuated 
tube collectors developed an effective heat transfer and exceptional 
operating temperature levels as compared to ﬂat plate collectors. 

Furthermore, Evacuated tube collectors require no tracking sys- 
tem as they can absorb solar energy from all directions, are con- 
sidered eﬃcient and effective thermal collectors because of the de- 
sign features of the absorber tube including the size and the ther- 
mal features. Moreover, different nanoﬂuids and the utilization of 
PCMs  have  been  described  as  reliable  and  applicable  techniques 
to increase the thermal performance of ETCs.  The electrical eﬃ- 
ciency of nanoﬂuids-based cooling PVT systems in direct channels, 
spiral channels, and microchannels is enhanced by 20.55%, 37.67%, 
and 27%, respectively [552] . The reﬂectors in the PV panel are not 
compulsory without the cooling system as the panel temperature 
will go higher. The thermal performance of a PVT system in a tur- 
bulent state is inﬂuenced by a number of channels, as the chan- 
nel output area increases, the thermal eﬃciency improves because 
of large energy and exergy ﬂow, but it is contradictory for lami- 
nar ﬂow. Few studies have presented promising and eﬃcient mi- 
crocapsule technology results compared to conventional PVT sys- 
tems [ 351 , 553 ]. The performance can be further enhanced by com- 
bining both nanoﬂuids and microcapsule technology. The perfor- 
mance of DASC is highly sensitive to the volume fraction of the 

59

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100898 

nanoparticles, therefore choosing optimal volume fractions is nec- 
essary,  as  increasing  the  volume  concentration  beyond  the  opti- 
mum values results in absorbing the incident radiation in a thin 
top  layer  of  the  nanoﬂuid  rather  volumetrically.  Long  term  and 
high-temperature stable nanoﬂuids are the future trends for DASC. 
Blended plasmonic nanoﬂuids, with controllable and broad band 
absorption properties, can be utilized for the absorption of the en- 
tire solar spectrum. 

It can be concluded from the literature review that most of the 
conducted up to date researches are focused mostly on using wa- 
ter or ethylene glycol as a baseﬂuid; similar studies can be per- 
formed using oil as a baseﬂuid for higher temperatures. Therefore, 
nanoﬂuids  of  aqueous  and  oil-based  with  single,  hybrid  as  well 
as magnetic nanoparticles experimentally investigated solar collec- 
tors. Different nanoﬂuids can be prepared at several pH levels, and 
their performance can be related both regarding eﬃciency as well 
as  corrosion.  Moreover,  the  exergoeconomic,  environmental,  and 
life cycle analysis should be accompanied by the experimental in- 
vestigations carried out to indicate the feasibility of nanoﬂuid for 
the solar systems. 

As discussed earlier, there are many novel ideas regarding the 
use  of  nanoﬂuids  in  solar  systems,  which  has  not  been  imple- 
mented yet, such as the hybrid and magnetic nanoﬂuids. Moreover, 
turbulators combinations such as the modiﬁed tubes, ﬂow inserts, 
new designs, etc. would be a promising direction, as reported in 
the literature [ 441 , 554 , 555 ]. There is a need for experimental in- 
vestigations using nanoﬂuids based solar collectors for large-scale 
applications, carrying out such experiments would prove the real 
performance enhancements, which would be a crucial step towards 
the commercialization and establishment of nanoﬂuids based so- 
lar systems. Stable nanoﬂuids at elevated temperatures are consid- 
ered as a new subject in the ﬁeld of nanoscience and nanotech- 
nology for high thermal applications. Since such high temperature 
working  conditions  offer  effective  energy  conversion  with  excel- 
lent eﬃciency. Thus, to utilize thermal nanoﬂuids in various indus- 
trial applications, it is necessary to evaluate their enhanced ther- 
mophysical  features,  appropriate  viscosity,  and  stable  dispersion. 
These features of nanoﬂuids can be well regulated by tuning the 
morphology, and size of nanoparticles, selection of scalable and ef- 
fective surface treating agents (surfactants), and base ﬂuids with 
good physicochemical ﬁrmness within the broad operating condi- 
tions. Besides, surface modiﬁcation and large-scale synthesis of ef- 
ﬁcient nanoﬂuids with affordable cost s are intensely scrutinized. 
The practical utilization of thermal nanoﬂuids in thermal engineer- 
ing  applications  has  raised  the  harsh  requirement  of  their  ther- 
mal and dispersion stability with respect to time and wide tem- 
perature range. However, high temperatures may promote the ag- 
glomeration  tendency  and  degradation  of  nanoﬂuids.  In  this  re- 
gard, high boiling point thermal oils such as oil [ 82 , 556 , 557 ] and 
ionic ﬂuids [ 558 , 559 ] have been investigated as thermally stable 
base ﬂuid. Therefore, long term stability under practical applica- 
tion conditions such as repeated heating/cooling cycles is highly 
demanded to explore [560] . Novel types of nanoﬂuids with higher 
thermal conductivity and lower dynamic viscosity are needed to 
be investigated for advanced heat transfer applications. In addition 
to all this, the effects of various parameters such as the Brownian 
motion, clustering, micro convection, and pH on the mono/hybrid 
nanoﬂuids properties are  also  important research  directions that 
require future investigation. According to the literature, exposure 
to nanoparticles can have severe effects on human health. There- 
fore, increased usage of nanoﬂuids and the speciﬁc human inter- 
face can be one of the present leading challenges. 

To fulﬁll the requirements for various applications, novel mate- 
rials, which should be carefully chosen from the 2D library, which 
consists  of  suitable  materials  with  different  structures,  composi- 
tions, and properties [ 561 , 562 ]. However, one must rationally de- 

sign  and  select  the  sizes,  functional  groups,  defects,  etc.,  rather 
than just combining the performance of all possible materials. At 
the same time, the stability, cost, and scalability of the production 
of these novel 2D materials should also be considered. Finally, it 
can be said that the exfoliation of 2D materials suspended in the 
baseﬂuid, as a dispersion, can serve as another class of solution be- 
sides the 1D materials such as the nanowires and the nanotubes, 
along with the 0D and quantum dots. One of the main appealing 
advantages that the 2D materials have is their ability to be manu- 
factured from the top-down method, resulting in exfoliated bulk 
layer  materials,  which  suggests  that  the  mass  production  would 
not be a bottleneck for industrial applications, provided with suit- 
able exfoliation techniques. These challenges require both funda- 
mental research and practical applications.

Despite  challenging 

fast  developments  of 
nanoscience  and  nanotechnology  have  enabled  the  researchers 
to  reveal  the  signiﬁcance  of  surface  modiﬁcation  for  good  dis- 
persion,  thermal  stability,  and  eﬃcient  heat  transfer  ability  of 
mono/hybrid  nanoﬂuids.  This  review  is  of  considerable  signiﬁ- 
cance  to  address  the  challenging  concerns  associated  with  the 
dispersibility and thermal stability of mono/hybrid nanoﬂuids and 
their applications in solar collectors. 

11. Summary and future prospective 

The present work covers recent studies around the nanoﬂuid- 
based solar systems for low and medium temperature levels. More 
speciﬁcally, the investigated systems are ﬂat plate collectors, evac- 
uated tube collectors thermal photovoltaic, and direct absorption 
solar  collectors.  The  emphasis  is  given  to  the  energy  and  ex- 
ergy performance of the investigated conﬁgurations, while the eco- 
nomic and environmental aspects of utilizing nanoﬂuids are also 
discussed in detail. The ﬁndings of this review paper can be instru- 
mental in easing the decision-making process to choose the appro- 
priate types of energy systems with nanoﬂuids. 

Several  outcomes,  gaps,  and  directions  are  derived  from  this 
comprehensive review paper. Having considered many review pa- 
pers in the literature on solar collectors and nanoﬂuids, this is the 
ﬁrst one that comprehensively covered all commonly used collec- 
tors together with important analysis aspects. So, it is much eas- 
ier to reach an inclusive ﬁgure of the whole solar system, which 
makes it easier to make the required decisions in this regard. There 
is also a gap in the literature that can be discovered by this review 
paper. The lack of the availability of such a widely discussed re- 
view paper is sensed. It can clear the path for researchers to de- 
cide to work on a collector, which provides optimum eﬃciency and 
outcome depends on the local climate conditions and required re- 
newable power (electricity or heat). Moreover, the focus of the pa- 
per is to discuss the applicability of nanoﬂuids and to evaluate the 
achieved outcomes in energy, exergy, economy, and environment, 
all of which are important to decision making. Furthermore, the 
point by point conclusion remarks of this paper are presented as 
follow, which cover the whole content. They are categorized into 
three sectors of a) Nanoﬂuids functionality, b) Solar collectors’ fea- 
sibility and c) Environmental, design and economical aspects. 

a) Nanoﬂuids Functionality 
b) The  forces  in  nanoﬂuids,  such  as  Brownian  motion  and  ther- 
mophoretic, have a vital function to balance the drag force for 
stating the motion of the particle and the rate of bulk ﬂuid heat 
transfer. Due to the small sizes (1-100 nm) of the nanoparti- 
cles, other forces (lift and Basset history) are insigniﬁcant. It is 
also important to state that the higher heat transfer rate was 
reported for the addition of nanoparticles and usually smaller 
nanoparticles in size.

c) Generally,  the  results  obtained  from  a  two-phase  approach 
model are more comparable to experimental information than 
those obtained by a single-phase model. To estimate the com- 
putational models’ precision, the uncertainty in the experimen- 
tal results, such as the aggregation/ sedimentation of the par- 
ticles  and  inaccuracies  in  measurements,  should  be  studied. 
Moreover, among the two-phase models, the simplest method 
to employ is the two-phase mixture model. 

d) Precise  models  for  the  thermophysical  characteristics  can  be 
used to quickly estimate the rate of heat transfer for geomet- 
rically simple diﬃculties such as natural convection in cavities 
than using a single-phase homogenous approach. Moreover, it 
must be said that in order to reduce the errors in the predic- 
tion of heat and mass ﬂow characteristics in a single-phase ap- 
proach, the use of new models for thermophysical properties 
are recommended instead of the classic models. 

e) There  are  no  consistencies  among  the  experimental  data  re- 
ported by the researchers and the mathematical models, some- 
thing that indicates the need for more work on this area. Fur- 
thermore, there is a great variety of parameters that play an es- 
sential role in the enhancement margin with nanoﬂuids such as 
nanoparticle size, nanoparticle kind, volume fraction, and pH. 
f) The increased pumping power for the nanoﬂuids must be con- 
sidered in any case. More experimental studies are required to 
be carried out to show the effect of nanoﬂuids with higher con- 
centrations on the pumping power, the pressure drop as well as 
friction factor. 

g) Solar Collectors Feasibility 
h) The nanoﬂuids can clearly enhance the energy performance of 
solar systems with improvements around 3% to 5%. Also, the 
exergy performance of solar systems increases with the appli- 
cation of nanoﬂuids. Some studies indicate high exergetic en- 
hancements (up to 60%) with the use of nanoﬂuids, especially 
in ﬂat plate collectors and in thermal photovoltaics. 

i) The  nanoﬂuid-based  thermal  photovoltaic  collectors  present 
high interest because they are practically cogeneration systems, 
and  the  nanoﬂuid  utilization  enhances  both  the  thermal  and 
the  electrical  output.  So,  the  overall  performance  can  be  im- 
proved by a great percentage. 

j) Although smaller nanoparticle and low volume concentrations 
are more preferable, there is no unique solution for enhancing 
such collector type, and the selection of nanoparticles will de- 
pend on various parameters, including cost, pumping penalty, 
and operating conditions. 

k) The most usually used nanoparticles in the solar systems are 
Al2O3,  Cu,  CuO,  Fe3O4,  SiC,  TiO2,  Au,  and  the  carbon  nan- 
otubes (CNT, MWCNT, and SWCNT). Among them, the carbon 
nanotubes seem to be promising choices, while the use of cop- 
per is also an essential choice because of high thermal conduc- 
tivity. The use of Au is eliminated due to the high cost, while 
the use of SiC has an advantage due to the low cost. 

l) Environmental, Design and Economic Aspects 

m) The use of exergy analysis is vital to design sustainable systems, 
while the environmental study also must be performed to de- 
sign global optimum systems. 

n) Although  the  nanoﬂuids  are  not  inexpensive,  the  economic 
analysis shows that using nanoﬂuids in solar energy systems is 
economically beneﬁcial for a long time. 

o) The application of nanoﬂuid in low and medium temperature 
solar thermal collectors resulted in increasing the eﬃciency of 
the different types that resulted in decreasing the material re- 
quired for the manufacturing and considerable reduction in the 
harmful gases into the environment, especially that of CO2. The 
different  studies  demonstrated  that  such  a  reduction  in  the 
harmful  gas  emissions  would  be  signiﬁcantly  increased  with 
the increase in solar energy applications. Although of the pos- 

itive impact of the nanoﬂuid on the environment, nanomateri- 
als are considered hazardous materials, and care must be done 
during their handling. Unfortunately, no studies have been done 
on the proper handling and disposal of the different nanoﬂuids. 
p) Using nanoﬂuids can result in creating more compact systems 
and reduce land use as well. Furthermore, due to the increased 
eﬃciency of solar collectors using nanoﬂuids can reduce CO2 
emissions.  Therefore,  the  incorporation  of  solar  collectors  for 
nanoﬂuids  is  an  important  area,  as  the  usage  of  nanoﬂuids 
can  provide  a  substitute,  eco-friendly,  and  sustainable  energy 
source. 

q) It  is  signiﬁcant  to  mention  that  the  control  about  nanoﬂu- 
ids  (long-term  stability,  preparations,  thermophysical  proper- 
ties, etc.) must be investigated experimentally to report accu- 
rate outcomes about the nanoﬂuids’ feasibility in solar collec- 
tors for large-scale applications. 

In addition, different research directions are also presented 

according to the review work: 

- There  is  a  need  for  developing  new  models  for  nanoﬂuid 
performance and thermal properties. The use of experi- 
mental results is essential in order to have accurate mod- 
els. 
Investigations on the effect of nanoﬂuid stability on the 
long-term  cost  of  designing  sustainable  solar  collectors 
need  to  be  carried  out.  The  development  of  large  sys- 
tems for these issues is vital for the development of the 
nanoﬂuid-based solar system technology. 
There  is  a  need  for  performing  real  installations  (pilot 
and commercial) with nanoﬂuid-based solar systems. The 
long-term  operation  of  these  conﬁgurations  can  prove 
the sustainability of this technology. 
It is important to apply nanoﬂuids in solar-driven energy 
systems. For example, desalination units, organic Rankine 
cycle, district heating systems, sorption cooling systems, 
cogeneration/trigeneration  systems,  and  power  produc- 
tion systems. 
Increasing thermal eﬃciency and the electrical eﬃciency 
of PVT solar technologies can be an effective way to ap- 
ply solar power in the building in a competitive condi- 
tion. Therefore, the cost of solar systems can be reduced. 
Moreover, the design and construction of new solar sys- 
tems following the architectural standards of the building 
are more attractive. 
-Advanced  materials  with  advanced  properties  need  to 
be  used.  It  is  suggested  to  investigate  the  Mxene  fam- 
ily  which  is  considered  as  an  advanced  2D  material 
with various properties such as high porosity, high func- 
tional  groups,  high  optical  and  conductivities  (thermal 
and  electrical),  etc.  This  family  has  not  been  tested  in 
renewable  energy-based  nanoﬂuids,  and  by  introducing 
Mxene as a potential candidate for nanoﬂuidic research, 
a window is opened for solar and nanoﬂuid researchers.
