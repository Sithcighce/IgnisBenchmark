Hydrogen (H2) is currently considered a clean fuel to decrease anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and will
play  a  vital  role  in  climate  change  mitigation.  Nevertheless,  one  of  the  primary  challenges  of  achieving  a
complete  H2  economy  is  the  large-scale  storage  of  H2,  which  is  unsafe  on  the  surface  because  H2  is  highly
compressible, volatile, and flammable. Hydrogen storage in geological formations could be a potential solution to
this problem because of the abundance of such formations and their high storage capacities. Wettability plays a
critical role in the displacement of formation water and determines the containment safety, storage capacity, and
amount  of  trapped  H2  (or  recovery  factor).  However,  no  comprehensive  review  article  has  been  published
explaining  H2  wettability  in  geological  conditions.  Therefore,  this  review  focuses  on  the  influence  of  various
parameters, such as salinity, temperature, pressure, surface roughness, and formation type, on wettability and,
consequently, H2 storage. Significant gaps exist in the literature on understanding the effect of organic material
on  H2  storage  capacity.  Thus,  this  review  summarizes  recent  advances  in  rock/H2/brine  systems  containing
organic  material  in  various  geological  reservoirs.  The  paper  also  presents  influential  parameters  affecting  H2
storage capacity and containment safety, including liquid–gas interfacial tension, rock–fluid interfacial tension,
and adsorption. The paper aims to provide the scientific community with an expert opinion to understand the
challenges  of  H2  storage  and  identify  storage  solutions.  In  addition,  the  essential  differences  between  under-
ground  H2  storage  (UHS),  natural  gas  storage,  and  carbon  dioxide  geological  storage  are  discussed,  and  the
direction of future research is presented. Therefore, this review promotes thorough knowledge of UHS, provides
guidance on operating large-scale UHS projects, encourages climate engineers to focus more on UHS research,
and provides an overview of advanced technology. This review also inspires researchers in the field of climate
change to give more credit to UHS studies.

1. Introduction

Hydrogen  (H2)  is  currently  considered  the  second-most  important
energy source after fossil fuels [1–3]. As a nonpolluting energy carrier,
H2  could be an appropriate  choice for potential energy system devel-
opment in all countries worldwide [4]. It is possible to use H2 for energy
storage and generate electricity and heat if required. Moreover, H2 has
no adverse effect on the environment and can be used in transportation
[4–6].

Infrastructure security and reliability are prerequisites for achieving
an H2  economy. The system design must be robust and demonstrate a

level of security equal to or better than the current technology. The use
of H2  for new applications is still in its infancy, and early-stage tech-
niques often suffer from “early life”  or “infant mortality”  failures [7].
Like  many  other  fuels,  H2  is  flammable,  but  there  are  also  concerns
about H2-related hazards from serious H2-related accidents, such as the
1937  Hindenburg  fire  and  the  2011  H2  explosion  at  the  Fukushima
nuclear power plant [8]. Therefore, even minor accidents in H2 systems
(storage  facilities  and  gas  stations)  can  considerably  postpone  the
development, use, and public acceptance of H2 technology. The safe and
reliable performance of these early-use systems can instill trust among
people,  and  public  opinion  significantly  affects  policy  [9].  Conse-
quently,  ensuring  a  safe  and  reliable  system  is  a  decisive  factor  in

accelerating the development and adoption of H2 technology.

One of the promising technologies regarding H2  is underground H2
storage  (UHS),  where  compressed  H2  can  be  economically  stored  un-
derground on a large scale [10–15]. Hydrogen gas is safely and rapidly
injected into geological formations using this technology. The geological
formations that can store H2  in large quantities are deep aquifers [16,
17],  empty  salt  caverns  [10,11,18],  underground  coal  seams,  and
depleted  hydrocarbon  reservoirs  [19–21].  Depending  on  the  energy
demand,  the  storage  time  can  range  from  months  to  years  [10,15].
Moreover,  UHS  has  proven  feasible  in  salt  caverns  [10,11,18,22].
However, further research is necessary for UHS in depleted hydrocarbon
reservoirs,  coal  beds,  and  deep  saline  aquifers,  which  are  available
worldwide with higher storage capacities [15,23].

An  essential  feature  of  evaluating  the  applicability  of  these  sedi-
mentary  reservoirs  (because  such  reservoirs  usually  have  carbonatic,
maceral, or siliciclastic origins, making them porous [23]) for UHS is
how H2 acts in the porous network of rocks in actual geological storage
(geo-storage)  conditions  (i.e.,  high  temperature  and  pressure).  These
effects regarding porous rocks are critical in modeling fluid dynamics in
the  reservoir  because  the  formation  brine  and  H2  coexist  in  the  sedi-
mentary rock pores and can flow concurrently due to the brine in porous
formations [24].  Consequently, through wettability, pore-scale effects
control such features as storage capacity, containment security, and H2
injection and withdrawal rates [25]. Pan et al. [26] critically reviewed
the UHS processes and their reservoir-scale effects. They also classified
these  parameters  into  three  main  categories:  fluid  properties,  solid
properties, and solid–fluid interactions.

Many reviews of H2 storage have been published [27–39], but most
have focused on the materials used for storage or the global H2 economy
[40–44]. Based on the application, diverse requirements exist for UHS.
Therefore, this paper investigates various aspects of UHS (H2 economy,
H2  energy,  and  H2  storage)  and  provides  a  general  explanation  for
readers who are not or are only partially involved in various areas of H2
technology. Moreover, in underground gas storage, wettability controls
the  gas  distribution  into  geological  formations  and  influences  the
injection/production  rates,  structural  sealing  potential,  containment
security,  and  fluid  dynamics  [45–49].  Consequently,  investigating
various factors influencing wettability is vital from an economic and safe
UHS  viewpoint.  These  factors  include  temperature,  pressure,  organic
surface contamination, salinity, surface roughness, and rock type, which
are discussed in this article. This information is essential for reservoir

simulation and evaluating the possibility of UHS, which helps engineers
make better decisions with less uncertainty.

The following section (Section 2) discusses the H2 economy, usage,
and types of geological formations used for H2 storage. Section 3 focuses
on the  experimental procedures for measuring the  contact angle, and
Section 4 provides information on the parameters influencing the con-
tact angles in both ideal (in the absence of organic acids) and actual (in
the presence of organic acids) geo-storage conditions. Sections 5 and 6
cover interfacial tension (IFT) measurements for H2/fluid and rock/fluid
systems, respectively. The adsorption and desorption of H2 in coal seam
reservoirs and shale formations are outlined in Section 7. This review
also covers H2 coreflooding in porous geological media in Section 8 and
related field experience in UHS in Section 9. Finally, Sections 10 and 11
present the conclusions and recommendations, respectively. The study
aims to provide the reader with concise and robust information on the
subsurface behavior of H2 during geo-storage.

2. Hydrogen as an energy carrier

2.1. Hydrogen usage as a clean fuel to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in 1750, as reported
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the amount of
carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased with increasing

Fig. 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and annual CO2 emissions from
1750 to 2019 [50].

anthropogenic  emissions  (Fig.  1)  [50].  As  a  result,  climate  change  is
significantly  associated  with  environmental  effects,  causing  reduced
agricultural yields, animal species extinction, the migration of people,
increased extreme weather events, and conflict [39].

Global greenhouse gas emissions are increasingly being reduced to
mitigate  climate  change.  For  instance,  France  enacted  Law  No.
2,015,992,  requiring  a  reduction  of  40%  of  greenhouse  gas  by  2030
compared  to  1990  levels  [51].  Excessive  emission  of  CO2  from  fossil
fuels is one of the most important sources of greenhouse gasses [52,53],
accounting  for  80%  of  all  greenhouse  gas  emissions  [54].  Significant
reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are  considered  to  mean  re-
ductions in fossil fuel consumption. In 2017, fossil fuels produced over
85% of energy globally [55]. Producing and burning H2 in place of fossil
fuels could potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease
global  warming  [55–58].  However,  because  H2  is  volatile  and  highly
compressible,  the  main  obstacle  to  implementing  such  energy  supply
chains is H2  storage on a large scale [15,59]. A possible solution is H2
geo-storage, where H2 is stored in subterranean reservoirs [48,60,61].
Recently, the need to consider alternative energy sources has been
the  center  of  attention  [62–65].  Environmental  problems  related  to
climate change, global warming, and the need to decrease CO2 emissions
have  aroused  interest  in  searching  for  new  technologies  to  overcome
these effects [3]. Hydrogen is currently valued as a clean fuel to reduce
CO2  emissions  and  decrease  the  effects  of  greenhouse  gasses  [46].  In
addition, fossil fuels will eventually be depleted [66,67]. Hydrogen is
the lightest and most energy-efficient element globally and can be used
as an almost infinite source on earth. Therefore, it significantly reduces
the effects of anthropogenic CO2 emissions [10,38,68]. The production
of high-purity H2 reduces the required H2 buffer storage and promotes
the development of the H2 market for automobiles and other distributed
energy consumers. Therefore, this process can be a solution to mitigate
greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2 [69].

2.2. Hydrogen economy

The concept of an H2 economy has received considerable attention in
industry and science because it promises a sustainable energy distribu-
tion system. The H2 economy is a proposed system in which H2 can be
produced and widely used as a primary energy carrier. The transition
from fossil fuel to H2 must consider significant factors, such as political,
social,  technological,  scientific,  economic,  and  environmental  chal-
lenges [70]. Projections for the global energy transition indicate that a
complete H2  market is likely by 2050 [71]. However, this can only be
achieved by raising awareness and through research and development
programs to explore and study the problems and opportunities that this
new technology poses [70].

The effective progress of the H2 economy has enormous benefits for
energy security, the environment, the economy, and end users [36,37,
72–74]. To achieve a developed H2 economy, H2 must be stored safely
and cost-effectively [35]. Fig. 2 illustrates a sustainable carbon-free H2
energy  system  that  enables  and  combines  all  the  phases,  such  as
renewable energy sources, renewable H2 production, H2 storage, and H2
supply [75]. This system is a unified H2-based energy system that allows
an  extensive  combination  of  renewable  energy  sources,  such  as  solar
energy and wind [76]. Additionally, H2 geo-storage allows energy to be
stored until it meets the demand or must be supplied for transportation.
Electricity  can  be  successfully  converted  to  H2  by  electrolysis,  which
does not produce greenhouse gasses or other pollutants [77]. Electricity
production  may  continue  to  rely  on  fossil  fuels  for  years;  however,
developing more renewable resources and efficient production methods
can result in cheaper H2 production. This combination could cause the
H2 economy to flourish. The second aspect of the future H2 economy is
production distribution. Several technologies, such as thermochemical
processes,  coal  gasification,  and  high-temperature  electrolysis,  are
suitable for centralized large-scale production processes [78].

Another  opportunity  for  the  H2  economy  in  the  future  lies  in  the
competitive  electricity  market,  considering  the  substantial  price

difference  between  peak  and  low-cost  hours,  which  may  or  may  not
match peak and low demand times [79]. The ability to convert H2 into
electricity is critical to the H2 economy. Fuel cells have been selected as
the power generation method to meet the peak power demand primarily
because fuel  cells are  as efficient  as 40% to  60% in converting H2  to
electricity [79].

An overview of an H2-based global energy system in the 21st century
was provided by several researchers [80,81] to demonstrate the poten-
tial  of  the  H2  economy  both  quantitatively  and  qualitatively.  They
investigated  the  effects  of  uncertainties  in  the  initial  stages  of  H2
development, such as the rate of technological change and energy prices.
In addition, several countries have evaluated the prospects for H2  uti-
lization depending on the circumstances of their countries, including the
United  States [82,83],  China [84],  Canada [85],  the United  Kingdom
[82,83], Japan [82,86], Poland [14], France [12], Italy [87], and Ice-
land [88].

These studies have drawn many firm conclusions regarding the H2
demand  scale,  its  role  in  energy  systems,  and  its  economic  and  envi-
ronmental benefits. Despite its undeniable advantages, the rapid tran-
sition  from  fossil  energy  to  H2  energy  systems  faces  considerable
scientific,  technological,  and  socioeconomic  barriers.  Due  to  the  very
low density of H2, its large-scale storage is a crucial point of transition
toward  an  H2  economy  [35,70].  Hydrogen  is  commonly  used  in  re-
fineries and the chemical industry, but its production, storage, and de-
livery costs are too high to be acceptable for most energy applications
[89–91]. However, the enormous advantages of the H2  economy re so
attractive that governments worldwide are investing in improving the
outlook for their energy systems [36]. A critical overview of H2 energy,
storage, and economy is presented in Ref. [35]. The economics and cost
analysis  of  various  UHS  procedures  are  available  in  the  literature
[92–96].

Hydrogen storage is one of the main challenges in implementing a
complete  H2  economy  [48].  Large-scale  storage  facilities  may  be
required  to  maintain  sufficient  buffers  between  productions,  and
small-scale storage facilities may be required to support a fully devel-
oped  H2  economy.  The  H2  economy  requires  small-scale  storage  to
distribute and use H2  for several purposes. Small storage facilities are
characterized by short storage times and relatively low volumes of H2.
Whether internal combustion engines or fuel cells, H2-powered vehicles
may require onboard H2 storage and H2 storage at gas stations. Small H2
storage  capacities  may  also  be  required  for  portable  energy  and  resi-
dential  applications,  such  as  household  refueling,  emergency  genera-
tors, and stationary fuel cells [78]. Although small-scale storage is less
efficient and has higher investment costs than large-scale storage, it has
a better chance of being implemented because its investment risk is more
manageable [97]. In contrast, storing a large amount of H2 on the sur-
face for an extended period to implement a fully developed H2 economy
is challenging due to the high volatility and compressibility of H2  [98,
99]. An appropriate option to solve this problem is the storage of H2 in
subsurface reservoirs because of their massive storage capacity, safety,
and inexpensive operation [71,100]

2.3. Where hydrogen is used and its efficiency

Hydrogen  could  be  used  as  a  low-emission  fuel  in  the  transport
sector, for heating and cooling purposes, storing surplus electricity, and
transport applications, combining the energy and transport sectors. In
pilot projects, such as Fukuoka, Japan, one can envisage an entire city
consuming H2  as fuel with almost no pollution, which is a great moti-
vation for an H2 economy [101]. The other benefit of H2 is that H2 gas
already exists in the vast global market (with an estimated market value
of $154.74 billion by 2022 [102]). Hydrogen gas is extensively used in
agriculture  (to  produce  fertilizer),  hydrocracking  and  desulfurization
refineries, methanol and ammonia production, and food processing.

The presence of this market offers a good starting point because the
industry  is  familiar  with  H2  and  already  has  some  of  the  necessary

infrastructure for production, storage, delivery, and consumption [34].
Hydrogen can be used as an energy carrier, fuel, or raw material and has
various uses in the transportation, industrial, energy supply, and con-
struction  sectors.  More  importantly,  it  is  a  clean  combustion  fuel
because it does not emit CO2 during utilization. Therefore, zero or nearly
zero  emissions  can  be  enabled  in  industrial  processes  and  economic
sectors  where  carbon  emission  reductions  are  crucial  but  difficult  to
achieve [103].

Hydrogen can currently be produced from various resources, such as
water (H2O)  [104,105], coal [106],  natural gas [107–109], hydrogen
sulfide  (H2S)  [110–113],  metal  hydrides  [114–116],  and  biological
sources,  such  as  biomass  [117–120].  Despite  the  advances  in  the  H2
market as a promising energy carrier, the conventional methods of H2
production  (i.e.,  from  fossil  fuel)  have  adverse  environmental  effects
[121]. Thus, renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and nuclear
energy, are favored when seeking clean H2 production [122]. Moreover,
H2  can  be  produced  using  the  electrolytic  method  [123]  or  biomass
using microbial or chemical methods [124,125]. Other approaches to
producing H2 include H2O electrolysis, gasification, steam reforming of
methane (CH4), H2O-splitting, photo-electrochemical, photo-biological,
and liquid thermochemical methods [126,127]. As with all renewable
energy  sources,  some  restrictions  exist  on  using  H2.  One  of  the  main
obstacles  to  using  H2  is  the  need  for  substantial  amounts  of  H2  to
continue to produce energy. For example, it takes four times as much H2
to generate the same energy as gasoline [128].

2.4. Why hydrogen geo-storage should be done

By  2050,  the  ambitious  goals  of  the  Paris  Climate  Protection
Agreement should be achieved. However, the steady rise in CO2  emis-
sions  from  fossil  fuels  has  caused  a  need  for  alternative  clean  and
renewable energy  sources [129–131].  Wind  and  solar  energy provide
discontinuous and unstable power sources that require energy storage
and  backup  solutions  on  a  scale  comparable  to  the  power  generation
capacity.  Decarbonization  is  particularly  difficult  in  some  industrial
sectors [132]. For instance, the most critical aspect is guaranteeing that
technology options are accessible at the desired scale with a satisfactory
cost [64,133–136].

A promising solution for balancing the energy supply and demand
from renewable energy sources is H2 as an energy carrier, which should
be accompanied by an energy storage system. The advantages of using
H2 are its high specific energy, nontoxicity, and low CO2 emissions after
combustion.  Nevertheless,  a  cost-effective,  flexible,  and  environmen-
tally friendly storage system is required to store and reproduce H2 suf-
ficiently  to  meet  fluctuating  energy  demands  without  affecting  the
atmosphere [75,137]. There are two types of onboard H2  storage: sur-
face storage and underground storage technology. Surface H2 storage is
mature, well-established, and characterized by  good design flexibility
[128,138], with low levels of contaminants and impurities in the stored
H2  during standard operations [94,100]. However, surface storage fa-
cilities, such as tanks and pipelines, have limited storage and discharge
capabilities [139]. This storage system also requires a special tank or
reservoir with a high cost of capital to store H2  on the ground [140].
Moreover, surface storage technologies are insufficient to meet the re-
quirements for large-scale storage. Thus, developing a safe, reliable, and
cost-effective storage system is required to facilitate the development of
an H2 economy [138].

Large-scale  gas  storage  for  various  forms  of  energy  applications
would  enable  better  integration  with  renewable  energy  sources
[141–144], regulate energy prices [145], balance energy demand and
supply [146–148], provide energy security, and more efficiently manage
energy networks [149–151]. Compared to surface storage, UHS facilities
are better protected from external threats (e.g., terrorist attacks, military
actions,  fire,  etc.)  due  to  the  upper  strata.  They  also  provide  higher
storage pressure, greater energy density, lower investment costs, and a
smaller surface footprint than surface storage [152–155].

For  decades,  large-scale  natural  gas  geo-storage  has  been  success-
fully carried out in salt caverns (8%), underground aquifers (12%), and
depleted  oil/gas fields (80%) [156]. The subterranean formations are
appropriate  places  for  holding  H2  in  times  of  excess  H2  production,
where  it  can  be  stored  for  several  months  and  recovered  for
re-electrification  if  necessary  [157,158].  Despite  the  tremendous  op-
portunities that UHS offers, maturity remains low, and multiple chal-
lenges and uncertainties exist [139]. Most of these concerns are related
to the geochemical interactions with the rock matrix and reservoir fluids
[159–161],  microbiological  interactions  [162,163],  tightness  of  the
underground storage facilities [164,165], storage efficiency, and project
economics (e.g., the amount of cushion and working gasses) [166].

Various field and laboratory studies have confirmed the viability of
UHS,  considering  safety  [167];  capacity  [167,168];  geochemical  [19,
169,170],  physiochemical  [160,171,172],  biochemical,  or  microbial
[20,162,173,174] aspects; and economic feasibility [92,175]. However,
depending on the area and type of storage system, some concerns, such
as  in  situ  reactions  [20],  large  amounts  of  H2O  extraction  during  H2
production  [16,17],  site  suitability  and  capacity  [171],  undesirable
hydrodynamics  [25,176],  leakage  [20,173],  environmental  issues
[175],  and  costs  [92],  can limit  the  efficiency of  the  storage  process.
Thus,  the  storage  process  should  be  improved  through  model  studies
[16,17,177,178] and regular monitoring for secure and safe storage.

The evaluation of the sealability of H2  (or the height of the H2  col-
umn) is essential to minimize the risk of H2  leaking upward from the
sealed caprock. The sealed rock has fine pores that create a hydraulically
tight caprock with low permeability and high capillary threshold pres-
sure. The high threshold pressure, along with the IFT and wettability
properties,  determines  the  ultimate  column  height  the  seal  can  hold,
consequently  affecting  the  final  reservoir  capacity.  Hydrogen  is  ex-
pected  to  have  higher  capillary  pressure  because  of  its  high  IFT
compared to natural gas geo-storage [179,180]. Thus, H2 can be stored
in  the  reservoir  at  a  higher  pressure  than  CH4,  reducing  the  risk  of
geomechanical failure [132].

2.5. Types of geological formations where hydrogen can be stored

Hydrogen conversion and its storage are suitable in fields with po-
tential  geo-storage  near  high  levels  of  renewable  energy  generation
[16]. The general criteria for the selection of geo-storage sites include (i)
sufficient  capacity  (i.e.,  thickness  and  porosity)  and  injectivity  (i.e.,
permeability), (ii) a suitable caprock acting as a sealing barrier, and (iii)
a stable geological environment to maintain the integrity of the storage
site [181,182]. Different types of geo-storage formations can be used for
gas (e.g., CO2) storage, including deep saline aquifers, depleted oil and
gas  reservoirs  [183,184],  coal  seams  [185–187],  organic-rich  shales
[188,189], and basaltic rocks [190,191]. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs
and deep saline aquifers are widely known as the primary storage sites
for  gas  storage.  Both  storage  sites  are  plentiful  worldwide  and  have
enormous  capacities  for  gas  storage  [184,192].  These  formations  are
usually  carbonate  or  sandstone  rocks  [193,194].  Carbonate  rocks  are
considered more permeable, allowing for large amounts of gas injection
compared to less permeable sandstones [195].

Coal seams are also considered potential formations for CO2 storage
to enhance the recovery of coalbed methane (CBM). In coal seams, gas
can be stored by three processes: 1) the pore matrix is occupied by free
gas, 2) a vast volume of gas is dissolved into the pore matrix liquid, and
3)  the  gas  is  trapped  on  the  coal  surface  as  adsorbate  [185,186].  In
addition, organic-rich shale is another candidate for CO2 sequestration.
These  formations  are  considered  impermeable  and  low-porous  rocks,
storing  significant  amounts  of  CO2.  In  these  formations,  CO2  can  be
adsorbed on highly dispersed organic matter, such as kerogens [189].
Furthermore,  basalt  has  recently  exhibited  high  potential  for  CO2
storage in a mineralized form using a method developed by the CarbFix
team [196–198]. In this method, H2O and CO2 are injected together into
a basalt formation. The injected carbonated H2O causes rapid chemical

reactions and provides permanent and safe CO2  storage in the form of
carbonates [199]. Nevertheless, not all porous media are suitable for H2
storage, and some formations may lack suitable trapping mechanisms,
caprocks, and storage environments. Fig. 3 illustrates formation types
that can be used as H2  geo-storage. The figure also summarizes the ef-
fects of geological formations and microorganisms on UHS in various
media, such as depleted gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, and salt caverns.
The most appropriate geo-storage formations for H2 are depleted oil and
gas reservoirs [200], abandoned mines [201], geo-storage aquifers, salt
caverns [128], and hard rock caverns [140].

Hydrogen  can  cause  reduction-oxidation  (redox)  reactions  and
modify rock minerals, leading to mineral dissolution and precipitation
[38]. Mineral dissolution/precipitation can affect the porosity, perme-
ability, and fluid flow behavior of the reservoir and influence the me-
chanical  properties  of  the  caprock  and  reservoir  [139,161,203,204].
Changes  in  caprock  porosity  can  either  enhance  or  reduce  its  sealing
capacity  [19].  In  addition,  H2  storage  and  structural  trapping  can  be
affected  by  the  hysteresis  effects  and  mineralogy  of  the  sealing  rocks
[139,205].  The  analysis  of  hysteresis,  caused  by  the  discrepancy  be-
tween advancing and receding contact angles [206], can facilitate the
accurate prediction of H2  injection (primary drainage), H2  withdrawal
(secondary imbibition), and H2 reinjection (secondary drainage) [205].
In  many  cases,  microbial  activity  can  have  several  effects  on  the
system,  such  as  H2  loss,  clogging,  corrosion,  and  souring  [162].  For
instance,
influence  H2
geo-storage, consuming H2  gas in the metabolic system and producing
gasses, such as H2S, CO2, CH4, and others. Therefore, the investigation of
geochemical  and  microbial activity  is  critical  for  the  sustainability  of
UHS in porous reservoirs [162]. The chemical reactions and main mi-
crobial H2-consuming processes occurring during UHS are available in
several  studies  [162,169,173,207,208].  Hydrogen  is  stored  in  forma-
tions at higher pressures than the initial preproduction pressure. Thus, it
is essential to keep the storage pressure lower than the preproduction
pressure to mitigate the possibility of geomechanical failure [179]. In
addition,  some  obstacles  hinder  the  use  of  UHS.  For  example,  the
leakage of H2 is considered dangerous because the released H2 can react
with other minerals near the storage site and produce dangerous pol-
lutants [38]. Therefore, certain conditions are needed to choose the best
location for UHS.

sulfate-reducing  bacteria  considerably

Geological  sites  used  for  underground  gas  storage  are  categorized
into two groups: i) cavern storage, where the gas is stored in solution-
mined  or  excavated  cavities  in  dense  rock,  and  ii)  porous  media,
where  the  gas  is  stored  in  the  pore  spaces  of  carbonate  or  sandstone
formations [38]. Table 1 summarizes the critical characteristics of the
geological structures for UHS.

The geological structures with the following characteristics are rated
as  good:  high  storage  capacity,  no  microbiological/geochemical  in-
teractions between the rock matrix and reservoir fluids, the best tight-
ness (sealing rigidity), a lower share of cushion gas required for pressure
maintenance during operations, and high efficiency haracterized by the
number of production and injection cycles. In contrast, structures with
low  tightness  and  microbiological/geochemical  interactions  with
adverse effects on gas storage are rated as poor [33,164].

Underground  geological  formations  are  anoxic  where  reduction
conditions occur [214,215]. These reservoirs contain enough dissolved
organic matter [216–219] to considerably change the wettability of the
rock/H2/brine  system  [46,220–224].  The  adsorption  of  organic  sub-
stances on mineral surfaces can affect the wettability of reservoir rocks
[225–231].  However,  organic  acid  contamination  may  reduce  the
geo-storage capacity and H2 containment security. Therefore, it is vital
to consider the concentrations of organic acids and their influence on H2
wettability  in  reservoir  rocks  to  ensure  optimal  conditions  for
geo-storage [232,233].

With the advent of modern analytical techniques, such as gas chro-
matography and mass spectrometry, in the late 1960s, geochemical re-
searchers have had a high interest in separating organic acids from crude

oil  streams  [234]. These  fatty  acids can be  found  in many  geological
formations, including saturated straight-chain dicarboxylic and mono-
carboxylic  acids  and  unsaturated  branched-chain  and  straight-chain
fatty  acids  [219,235].  Many  research  scientists  have  experimentally
demonstrated the presence of trace concentrations of organic acids in
geological  formations (e.g., deep  saline aquifers) from diagenesis and
fossil biodegradation of organic matter [218,236,237].

2.6. Trapping capacities and trapping mechanisms

In  contrast to  CO2,  which  is  permanently  trapped  in  underground
reservoirs [45], the stored H2 should be reproduced during peak demand
to provide electricity or energy [11,33,168]. Deep saline aquifers, coal
seams, salt caverns, basaltic formations, and depleted oil and gas res-
ervoirs have been proposed as potential H2 geological reservoirs [33,70,
75]. However, salt caverns have been the only storage place for pure H2

on an industrial scale [15,38]. Two types of rocks are needed to store
gasses in geological formations: an impermeable layer (i.e., caprock) for
trapping gasses and a permeable reservoir rock for storing gasses [38,
139].  Various  storage  mechanisms  are  available  in  underground  for-
mations  trapping  CO2  permanently  (Fig.  4),  which  include  the
following:

• structural trapping in which a tight caprock acts as a sealing barrier

that does not allow CO2 to penetrate,

• residual trapping in which CO2  plumes are split into many micron-
sized  bubbles  and  immobilized  by  the  capillary  force  within  rock
pores,

• dissolution trapping in which CO2  dissolves in the reservoir brine,
slightly increasing the brine density and submerging gas-rich brine
deep into the reservoir, and

• mineral trapping in which the injected CO2  chemically reacts with
the  formation  rock  and  reservoir  brine,  forming  solid  precipitates
[188,194,238–242].

Fig.  4  also  presents  categories  of  CO2  vol  stacked  based  on  the
increased  risk  of  leakage,  from  leaked  CO2  of  the  reservoir  (red)  to
volumes  that  are  slightly  transportable  (yellow/orange)  or  dissolved
CO2 (dark green) permanently trapped in the reservoir [243]. However,
the most important H2  geo-storage mechanisms are structural and re-
sidual trapping, where a strong relationship exists between the buoy-
ancy  and  capillary  forces  [198,206,238,244].  Consequently,  both
structural trapping (for calcite-rich caprock) and residual trapping (for
calcite-rich reservoirs) are necessary for H2  storage in calcite-rich for-
mations [240].

Understanding  the  wetting  properties  of  the  formation  rock  and
caprock is critical to studying the structural and residual trapping po-
tential in UHS [46]. Capillary sealing efficiency results from a trapping
mechanism, sometimes called structural or hydrodynamic trapping. In
this mechanism, the caprock or a sealing fault prevents rising gas plume
movement and usually maintains most of the injected gas in the reser-
voir. For this reason, it is also called primary trapping [245]. Capillary or
residual trappings are secondary trapping mechanisms in gas left during
reimbibition, which occurs behind a gas plume, remaining as separated
residual bubbles. In some cases, this mechanism maintains a significant
portion of the injected gas in the reservoir and increases containment
security [246,247]. In H2 geo-storage, capillary trapping is beneficial in
caprock but not in the reservoir.

Structural trapping may fail when rocks become H2  wet due to an
opposing  upward  suction  force,  leading  to  H2  leakage  through  the
caprock  [206,238].  Under  the  same  conditions,  the  H2  wettability  of
certain caprocks is lower than the CO2  wettability of such rocks, indi-
cating that the potential of structural trapping of the caprock is higher
during  UHS  than  CO2  storage  [46,48,248,249].  However,  the  overall
risk of H2 leakage remains high compared to CO2 due to its low density
and high mobility [250].

A large contact angle results in a smaller capillary force [251,252],
reducing the structural gas storage capacity and increasing the risk of
gas  leaks  [26].  Therefore,  the  influence  of  formation  pressure  and
temperature  (i.e.,  depth)  on  the  structural  trapping  capacities  and
containment safety of UHS projects must be considered [26].

Residual  trapping  (also  known  as  capillary  or  hysteresis  trapping)
occurs when clusters of the nonwetting phase remain in place through
capillary  forces  inside  the  pore  space  [206].  One  of  the  significant
challenges  in  reducing  H2  loss  during  UHS  projects  is  to  decrease  re-
sidual  trapping  during  the  cycling  process  [19,176].  Determining  the
residual  H2  saturation  is  especially  important  because  it  controls  the
unrecoverable portion of the stored gas and affects operation economics.
Capillary  forces  that  control  residual  containment,  drainage,  and  the
imbibition behavior of rock control the relative permeability. Further-
more, the relative permeability can change over time due to multiple H2
injection  and  withdrawal  cycles  [139].  Thus,  the  employed  experi-
mental procedures and techniques are essential for collecting wettability
data for H2 geo-storage.

In this paper, the experimental procedures, including the adsorption
mechanism and various methodologies for measuring the contact angles
and IFT, are explained in detail. Then, the influencing parameters on
wettability and their role in H2 geo-storage in the absence and presence
of organic acids are outlined. The paper ends with concluding remarks
and recommendations.

3. Experimental procedures

security, storage capacity, and safety of underground H2 projects [15,26,
38,65,253].  Wettability  is  very  complex,  and  all  properties  must  be
considered under actual geo-storage conditions to enhance this effect.
Thus, the wettability application in rock/fluid systems and its experi-
mental methods are presented to highlight the effect of the advancing
and  receding  contact  angles  on  structural  and  residual  trapping
mechanisms.

3.1. Adsorption mechanism

In the coal matrix, gas can be held in an adsorbed phase in which the
adsorption  capacity  depends  on  the  van  der  Waals  molecular  forces
between the gas and solid [254]. The gas movement in the coal matrix is
diffusive. The gas adsorption on the coal surface depends on the applied
pressure. The typical pressure of a deep coal bed is 35 to 60 bar [254]
because the reservoir depth is usually shallower than the oil reservoir
depth [255]. The chemical and physical properties of coal are key fac-
tors affecting gas adsorption on coal [256]. Therefore, other materials
must  be  inserted  to  change  the  coal  surface  and  pore  structure  to
improve  the  gas  adsorption  capacity  of  coal.  However,  scientific
research is currently underway to introduce useful chemicals into the
coal pore structure to improve its affinity for gas adsorption [257,258].
Fig. 5 presents a graphical representation of the experimental setup.
The  equipment  comprises  various  components,  such  as  a  valve  set,
pressure  transducers,  a  stainless-steel  sample  cell,  temperature  con-
trollers for the equipment and sample, a control panel, two reference
cells (one small and one large), and a data acquisition system.

The coal specimen was dried in a 60

C vacuum oven for a minimum
of 48 h. Afterward, the specimen was weighed and placed in the spec-
imen cell. About 0.9% ± 10% gr of a 0.5 to 1 mm coal specimen was
placed in the specimen holder to conduct the test. The calibration test for
volume was performed using helium gas to measure the volume of the
sample cell in which the specimen was loaded. Then, the sample cell was
vacuumed for 48 h. During all dynamic adsorption tests, the specimen

C. The temperature and
pressure data points were first recorded per second; however, the time
step gradually increased to 2 min as the gas adsorption continued. The
pressure  was  incrementally  applied  to  the  specimen  during  these  ex-
periments. The dynamic test was performed by applying 1.5 bar pressure
increments. The adsorption test was typically continued for 24 to 48 h at
each pressure step [259]. The diffusion parameters can be calculated by
Eq. (1) [259–261]:

where t0 denotes the required time for adsorption/desorption of 63.2%
of the whole gas under equilibrium conditions. The stretching parameter
β [260,261] represents the spread of the adsorption time, ranging from
0  to  1  depending  on  the  coal  characteristics.  In  addition,  M∞  is  the
amount  of  adsorbed  gas  at  the  end  of  the  experiment,  and  Mt  is  the
amount of adsorbed gas on the coal at time t.

Moreover,  the  diffusion  coefficient  (D)  can  be  experimentally
determined depending on the properties of various gasses (some have a
high  D  and  diffuse  quickly,  whereas  others  have  a  low  D  and  diffuse
slowly). In CBM, the diffusion coefficient can be determined from the
desorption time associated with the diffusion coefficient [262,263]. The
diffusion coefficient of H2 can be estimated using Eq. (2) [264]:

Underground H2 storage is strongly affected by the wetting proper-
ties of formation rocks, which determine the ability of H2 to be released
from  the  geological  reservoir.  Wetting  properties  also  control  the  in-
jection  and  withdrawal  rates  of  H2,  fluid  dynamics,  containment

3.2. Importance of rock wettability in hydrogen geo-storage reservoirs

The fluid ability of interaction with solid surfaces in the presence of
other immiscible fluids is called wettability [268]. It is defined using the
contact angle at which the fluid interface contacts a solid surface and is
usually determined in a denser phase [269,270]. The wetting phase is
defined  as  when  the  fluid  easily  adheres  to  the  surface  and  tends  to
reside in the smallest areas of the pore space. In contrast, in the non-
wetting phase, a less adherent fluid occupies the largest area of the pore
space, primarily in the center of large pores [270].

After injection, H2 coexists with in situ reservoir fluid, which can be
imaged  directly  using  x-ray  micro-computed  tomography  (micro-CT)
[62,65].  The  wettability  of  H2  to  rock  is  unevenly  distributed  under-
ground due to the heterogeneous rock surface chemistry, pore geometry,
and mineral composition [271–274]. These properties, which are sum-
med over the entire reservoir, determine the wettability of rocks [26].
The wettability of H2 to rock is critical because it governs the maximum
H2  storage  capacity,  capillary  pressure,  injectivity,  containment  secu-
rity, H2  saturation, and residual H2  saturation [241,275–279]. There-
fore,  wettability  properties  must  be  accurately  characterized.  Rock
wettability is directly related to the solid–fluid IFT (γSF) through Young’s
equation:

θ = arccos

γSG (cid:0) γSL
γLG

,

(5)

This  equation  is  derived  from  the  force  equilibrium  of  the  three
tensions, such as liquid–gas (γLG), solid–liquid (γSL), and solid–gas (γSG).
Therefore,  γSF  affects  the  H2  migration  and  distribution  in  reservoirs
[280–282]. No experimental method reliably measures this parameter;
thus, a semi-empirical method is used to predict γSF  [281–284]. If the
γLG, γSG, and γSL parameters are known, Young’s formula can be applied
to determine θ. However, the wettability of H2 under in situ sandstone
aquifer reservoir conditions has only been experimentally measured in

266]. However, the time constant (t0) at the laboratory scale differs from
the reservoir scale. Based on the Kazemi model for naturally fractured
reservoirs [267], the matrix–fracture interface area per unit bulk volume
(σ) can be described as follows:

one  publication  to  date  using  video  contact  angle  measurements  (θ)
[46].

The contact angle increases sharply with the temperature, pressure,
and organic acid concentration. Changes in temperature and pressure
physically affect the gas density and intramolecular force between the
rock and gas and, consequently, the contact angle [285,286]. Various
rocks  and  minerals,  such  as  coal,  shale,  mica,  dolomite,  calcite,  car-
bonates, and others, must be tested for future H2 wettability to reliably
evaluate the potential of UHS in a variety of other geological environ-
ments [26]. The precision of the contact angle measurement results is
affected by the fluid purity, solid surface quality, experimenter’s skill,
approach, and procedure.

Significant variations in the contact angle could be because of (a) the
effects of the surface roughness that cause a discrepancy between the
receding and advancing contact angles and (b) the contamination of the
substrate  surface  [287,288].  Therefore,  the  surface  cleanliness  of  the
substrate surface is critical. Even a trace of impurities can considerably
alter the contact angle [226]. Various approaches have been proposed to
measure contact angles [289–295]. The selection of a specific approach
depends  on  the shape  of  the system, involved  materials, and thermo-
dynamic  state  of  the  system  [296].  As  the  contact  angle  controls  the
placement of the fluid in the interstitial space, its experimental calcu-
lation  is  key  for  an  overall  understanding  of  the  multiphase  flow  in
reservoirs.  This  section  describes  various  methods  for  measuring  the
contact angle and their advantages and limitations.

3.2.1. Sessile drop method

Contact angle measurements are typically executed on a flat surface
under  ambient  conditions  using  the  sessile  drop  technique  [206,297,
298]  at  various  temperatures  and  pressures  [276].  The  sessile  drop
technique  places  H2O  droplets  on  a  mineral  surface  enclosed  by  a
low-density  fluid.  Experimentally,  a  narrow  needle  connected  to  a
high-pressure pump is used to bring the droplet into contact with the
mineral surface, and a photo of the droplet is taken with a camera after a
prespecified equilibrium time [299,300]. The schematic diagram of the
sessile drop method is presented in Fig. 7.

Bigelow et al. [301] established a simple and practical device called
the “telescope-goniometer” to determine the contact angle of different
liquids placed on a polished surface. In this method, the contact angle
can  be  easily  determined  by  the  tangent  to  the  droplet  profile  at  the
intersection of the three interfaces (i.e., the bottom of the droplet). The
contact  angle  of  a  droplet  on  a  polished  surface  is  obtained  using  a
photograph of the droplet profile or with a telescope equipped with a
goniometer eyepiece.

The advantage of this direct and quantitative technique is that it is
simple and requires only a small surface substrate (several square mil-
limeters)  and  a  small  amount  of  liquid  (several  microliters)  [302].
However, the main disadvantage of the goniometer technique is that it is
vulnerable  to  operator  error  if  a  strict  procedure  is  not  used  [299,
302–304].  Moreover,  because  of  the  small  size  of  the  substrate  and
liquid, the effect of contamination is relatively high. For precision and
reliability, the measurement depends on the operator’s consistency in

assigning the tangent line, which can cause substantial errors and dis-
crepancies between multiple users. Therefore, operators must follow the
general  guidelines  to  achieve  accurate  results.  If  the  drop  profile  is
◦
),  small  contact  angles  cannot  be  measured
nearly  flat  (less  than  20
precisely due to uncertain tangent assignments.

Furthermore, the dependency of the contact angles on the droplet
size leads to systematic problems. The heterogeneity or surface rough-
ness can result in contact point variations along the three-phase contact
line [305–307]. Despite these problems, if high precision is not essential,
the goniometer technique can be regarded as the most appropriate [43].
It is commonly accepted that the contact angle measurement of a droplet
directly  using  a  goniometer  provides  a  precision  of  nearly  ±2
[308,
309].

◦

3.2.2. Captive bubble method

Taggart et al. [310] suggested the method now called the “captive
bubble method.” In this method, the droplets (such as gas) are situated
beneath a solid surface surrounded by H2O (Fig. 8). If the plate is not
perfectly horizontal, the needle must stay inside the bubble to prevent
the bubble from moving on the mineral surface to avoid disturbing the
balance of the advancing angle. This technique enables us to change the
volume  of  the  droplets  during  the  measurement  while  recording  the
receding  and  advancing  contact  angles  [311–313].  Receding  and
advancing contact angles can be quite different. This difference can be
controlled by the surface heterogeneity or roughness [314,315]. Several
authors have reported an increase in contact angles with pressure [288,
316–319],  whereas  others  have  not  observed  such  an  increase
[320–322].  Some  researchers  have  also  measured  increased  contact
angles due to salt [318,320], whereas others have measured only slight
changes  [316,317].  Farokhpoor  et  al.  [321]  and  Sarajiet  et  al.  [319]
examined the temperature dependence of the contact angle but observed
no clear trend.

In this method, the mineral surface encounters the saturated atmo-
sphere.  This  method  reduces  the  contamination  of  the  solid-vapor
interface (e.g., oil droplets). Compared to the sessile drop method, the
liquid  temperature  can  be  monitored  much  easier  using  the  captive
bubble  technique,  through  which  the  temperature  dependence  of  the
contact angle is readily investigated. Due to the nature of the procedure,
the  captive  bubble  method  requires  much  more fluid  than the  sessile
drop method [323,324].

3.2.3. Tilting plate method

Adam and Jessop [325] proposed the tilting plate technique, which
has been preferred because of its easy implementation and relatively low
operator error. In this method, a solid rectangular plate with one end
fixed  on  top  of  the  test  liquid  and  the  other  end  rotated  toward  the
surface of the liquid until the plate end is immersed in the liquid creates
two menisci on either side of the plate. Then, the solid plate slowly ro-
tates  until  one  of  the  menisci  becomes  horizontal  (Fig.  9).  The  angle
between the solid and liquid surfaces is the corresponding contact angle
◦
[323,326].  This  method  can  have  an  error  of  ±5
due  to  liquid

immersion direction. Unlike regular shapes, the specimen should have
the same topography and composition on all sides. This requirement can
be  challenging,  especially  when  investigating  films  and  anisotropic
systems.  In  addition,  the  operator  must  use  an  adequate  amount  of
liquid,  which  can  cause  the  solid  surface  to  swell  or  absorb  vapors
inadvertently [302,331].

3.2.5. Capillary-rise method

If  a  liquid  encounters  a  vertically  wide  plate,  the  capillary  effect
causes the liquid to rise (Fig. 11). The height, h, of the capillary rise can
be calculated by integrating Laplace’s equation [332]:

sinθ = 1 (cid:0)

Δρgh2
2γlv

.

(8)

A plate approximately 2 cm wide meets the theoretical requirements
of  infinite  width.  The  Wilhelmy  plate  technique  can  be  improved  to
calculate the capillary height, h, and measure the contact angle [332,
333].  Dynamic  contact  angles  are  accomplished  by  moving  the  plate
upward and downward. This widespread approach has proven appro-
priate for calculating temperature-dependent contact angles [331]. This
method inherits most of the strengths and weaknesses of the Wilhelmy
plate method. Furthermore, Eqs. (7) and (8) can be coupled with the
relation of sin2θ + cos2θ = 1, and the liquid surface tension and contact
angle can be determined simultaneously [334].

3.2.6. Capillary penetration method

Washburn [335] suggested the capillary penetration method, which
is applied for determining powder wettability, and observed the liquid
penetration rate in a packed powder bed. The measurement is performed
by  recording  the  liquid  penetration  depth  into  a  packed  column  as  a
function of time. The contact angle can be derived from the Washburn
theory [329]:

l2 =

rtγlvcosθ
2η

,

(9)

where l is the liquid penetration depth, t denotes the penetration time
required,  r  represents  the  pore  radius,  and  η  indicates  the  liquid
viscosity.

Fig. 12 illustrates the Washburn capillary rise, where the powder is
packed into a capillary tube, and the liquid penetration depth depends
on  the  wettability  of  the  liquid  on  the  powder.  This  method  has  two
main requirements: (1) a wetting liquid to maintain the geometric factor
of the compressed powder and (2) a powder packed into multiple tubes
as uniformly as possible. If the powder cannot be not uniformly packed,
the collapsing of the powder or local channeling may occur during liquid

contamination. The main problem of contact angle measurement is the
liquid  disturbance  due  to  the  rotating  fixed  plate  and  the  need  for
considerable  operator  skill.  This  method  also  applies  to  determining
small (i.e., less than 10

) contact angles [327–329].

◦

3.2.4. Wilhelmy plate method

This technique is used widely and indirectly calculates the contact
angle  of  a  solid  sample  (Fig.  10).  When  a  smooth,  thin  vertical  plate
encounters the liquid, the weight variation is recorded on the plate. The
change in force observed on the plate is because of the wetting force and
buoyancy (the gravity force remains constant). The wetting force, f, is
described as follows [330]:

f = γlvpcosθ,

(6)

where γlv denotes the surface tension of the liquid, θ is the contact angle,
and  p  represents  the  area of  the  contact  line (i.e.,  equal  to  the  cross-
sectional  area  of  the  solid  sample).  Therefore,  the  sum  of  the  force
changes, F, recorded in the equilibrium, is as follows:

F = γlvpcosθ (cid:0) VΔρg,

(7)

where V denotes the volume of the displaced liquid, g is the acceleration
due to gravity, and Δρ represents the density difference between the air
and liquid.

Therefore, if the surface tension of the liquid and the circumference
of the solid are known, the contact angle value can be easily measured.
There are several advantages of this over traditional optical methods.
First, the contact angle can be determined by measuring only the length
and weight, which can be achieved with high accuracy and without the
operator’s subjectivity. Second, the calculated forces at any immersion
depth  are  already  averages.  Nevertheless,  this  method  has  several
drawbacks.  Solid  samples  should  have  a  uniform  cross  section  in  the

Three-dimensional  (3D)  x-ray  micro-CT  allows  the  study  of  high-
pressure  and  temperature  systems  representing  storage  reservoirs
[341–345]. The resulting image of the pore-space fluid provides a clear
understanding of the fluid configurations, gas–  H2O interfacial curva-
tures, capillary pressures, and associated contact angles [340,346,347].

3.3.1. Coreflooding flow cell

A cylindrical mini-core plug is placed in the flow cell to implement
the micro-CT coreflooding experiment. Two pipe-thread connections are
used as inlets and outlets for the micro-CT coreflooding end (Fig. 13).
Teflon and a plastic shrink sleeve cover the core plug to prevent fluid
bypass  and  are  heated  to  seal  the  core  plug  using  two  metal  ends.  A
plastic hardener can be applied to cover the core plug to improve the cell
strength and join the two metal ends together [348].

3.3.2. Micro-scale coreflooding procedure

Chen et al. [348] reported a procedure for micro-scale coreflooding,
in which the micro-scale coreflooding system was vacuumed for 24 h
before saturating the rock with salt water, as depicted in Fig. 14. Then,
the system was saturated with salt water for 24 h. Crude oil was injected
into the sample to reach the initial oil saturation. After the oil injection
into  the  core  plug  and  establishing  initial  oil  saturation,  the  x-ray
micro-CT was used to image the mini-core plug. Afterward, the core plug
was flooded with low and high salinity brine and reimaged with residual
oil  saturation  (Sor).  The  micro-CT  image  was  continued  using  a
beam-hardening filter to remove the  ring effect and beam hardening.
Next, a median filter was applied to reduce noise, and watershed seg-
mentation was applied to split the brine and oil phases (Fig. 15).

3.4. Interfacial tension measurements

Wettability is considered one of the main parameters in evaluating
the possibility of UHS. The IFT and contact angle between the reservoir
lithology and fluid naturally affect residual fluid and surface wettability.
These  two  properties  directly  affect  the  amount  of  gas  that  can  be
reserved and later recovered from the reservoir [66].

The  IFTs, or  interfacial interactions,  determine  fluid  behavior  and
distribution within porous media. Thus, the IFT between gas, brine, and
petroleum  reservoirs  considerably  influences  gas  storage  efficiency
[344]. The IFT between the gas and reservoir fluid in the presence of
impurities  is  the  basis  for  assessing  the  storage  capacity  of  sediment
formations  and  designing  a  safe  injection  pressure  [349].  The  IFT
measurements  were  performed  primarily  using  the  pendant-drop  or
capillary-rise approach. Recent studies have preferred the pendant-drop
method,  which  uses  high-speed  image  digitization  and  automatic
dependent surveillance automation for the drop profile analysis [350].
In  this  approach,  a  droplet  is  suspended  (in  the  form  of  a  dispensing
needle) from one end of a capillary tube in the presence of another fluid
at the given pressure and temperature. The droplet shape is adjusted by
balancing the surface and gravity forces under static conditions [276].
The droplet shape relates to the IFT of the liquid to a fluid according to
the Young–Laplace capillarity equation [351]:

from [348] with permission of the Elsevier).

penetration,  resulting  in  incorrect  contact  angle  values.  Likewise,
nonuniform packing leads to variations in the effective pore size from
point to point in the powder bed, making it difficult to determine the
accurate contact angle values. Furthermore, this method does not apply
to powder types a) with internal pores, b) that swell with liquid, and c)
◦
have contact angles higher than 90

[336].

The Washburn equation can be used to determine the contact angle.
This equation provides a kinetic model of the liquid rise in a cylindrical
capillary defined by [330]:

where v* represents the ability of the liquid to penetrate the porous solid

3.3. Coreflooding and micro-computed tomography

The  newly  developed  high-speed  micro-CT  allows  direct  real-time
imaging of displacement phenomena on the pore scale. Real-time im-
aging provides a more detailed understanding of the basic processes of
porous media, such as snap-off, hysteresis, and confinement of nonwet
phases. In addition, micro-CT facilitates the rigorous upscaling process
based on thermodynamic models [337], can directly determine the fluid
composition  of  rock  samples,  and  enables  the  study  of  dynamic
displacement [337,338] and H2O flooding in complex carbonate rocks
[339].  To  fully  comprehend  this  imaging  method  for  the  flow  of
immiscible fluids in porous media, see Ref. [340].

Singh et al. [273] employed x-ray micro-CT under two wettability
regimes to evaluate the local capillary pressure, in situ contact angles,
and fluid distribution through continuous oil and brine injections into
carbonate rocks. They concluded that rock wettability changes in situ
through  fatty  acids  doped  in  the  oil  phase  during  the  oil  injection,
causing the oil-filled pore space to be strongly oil-wet (θ = 180

).

pressure,  corrosion-resistant  cylindrical  chamber  with  temperature

pump connected to the gas cylinder. A transparent window is located
between the high-resolution camera and light source in the PVT cell. The
software KRUSS DSA 100 analyzes the captured images and calculates
the pendant-drop volume and IFT at preset time steps [352]. For more

Experimental measurements of the contact angle and IFT can be very
difficult and imprecise under sedimentary conditions, particularly in the
presence of toxic materials. As a result, the reported data are contro-
versial,  challenging some results  [354]. Molecular dynamics  was per-
formed to precisely measure the contact angle and IFT under extreme
conditions  (i.e.,  different  H2O  salinities,  high  temperature,  and  high
pressure) because this method can handle multicomponent systems (e.
g., the gas–brine interface) and can easily control the ion ratios, tem-
perature,  and  pressure  [355].  Furthermore,  in  molecular  dynamics
simulation studies, a clean substrate with favorable surface chemistry
can be created, which is difficult to achieve in experiments. For instance,
studies can be performed on mineral surfaces with various functional
groups to better recognize the changes in wettability caused by gas re-
actions  [356].  The  IFT  depends  on  several  parameters,  such  as  H2O
salinity, pressure, and temperature. Many scientists have been devoted
to studying these parameters [320,355,357–360].

3.5. Rock–Fluid interfacial tension calculation methodology

The  rock–fluid  IFTs  (i.e.,  rock–H2O  (γrock(cid:0) H2O)  and  rock–H2
(γrock(cid:0) H2)) are important parameters of the UHS because they affect the
spread of fluid in the reservoir, affecting the efficiency of H2  injection
and the recovery, storage capacity, and containment safety [361]. Thus,
it is crucial to accurately quantify these parameters to enable a reliable
assessment  and  estimate  of  the  H2  storage  capacity,  withdrawal  effi-
ciency, and leakage risk in the UHS. Pan et al. [282] first reported the
γrock(cid:0) H2  data  and  the  effects  of  organic  acids,  including  the  carbon
number  and  concentration,  on  γrock(cid:0) H2  under  UHS  conditions.  They
concluded that γrock(cid:0) H2 reduces with the temperature, pressure, carbon
number,  and  organic  acid  concentration,  whereas  γrock(cid:0) H2O  increases
with the carbon number and organic acid concentration.

The  comprehensive  theoretical  methods  for  measuring  the  solid-
–fluid  IFT  have  been  previously  provided  in  the  literature  [281–284,
362,363].  However,  this section  concisely presents the  corresponding
calculation method, as reported in previous studies [282,361].

The equilibrium contact angle (θe) is not experimentally accessible
under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions [284,364]; thus, it is first
calculated using the following equation:

(

θe = arccos

Nacosθa + Nrcosθr
Na + Nr

The experimental data on θa, θr, and γLG of the rock–H2O–gas system
are available in the literature [48,239,248,276,281,284,350,365–367].
Moreover,  the  γrock(cid:0) fluid  data  were  also  reported  in  a  study  [282]  to
enable  a  high  degree  of  prediction  of  the  wettability  associated  with
interfacial  properties,  further  supporting  the  implementation  of  the
UHS.

Substituting Young’s equation, Eq. (16), into Neumann’s equations,

Eqs. (17) and (18), results in Eq. (19):

where β is a constant, and γSG, γSL, and γLG are the solid–gas, solid–liquid,
and liquid–gas IFTs, respectively [282,361]. In Eq. (19), γLG and θe are
input parameters, and β and γSL are fitting parameters. In addition, γSL is
expected  to  be  constant  at  different  pressures  [281,283,284].  After
calculating the γSL  and β  parameters, γSG  can be determined using Eq.
(16) or (17).

4. Influencing parameters on wettability and their role in
hydrogen geo-storage

Generally, wettability can significantly affect many vital factors in
the  multiphase  flow  in  porous  rocks,  including  residual  nonaqueous
phase saturation [242,343,368], relative permeability [368,369], IFTs
of  rock  and  fluids  [328,346,370],  and  the  relationship  between  the
capillary  pressure  and  aqueous  phase  saturation  [45].  These  factors
determine the way fluids distribute within the reservoir [371]. There-
fore, examining the parameters influencing wettability is critical for H2
geo-storage  projects.  The  parameters  include  temperature,  pressure,
organic  surface  contamination,  rock  type,  surface  roughness,  and
salinity, which are discussed herein.

4.1. Effect of temperature and pressure on contact angles in ideal geo-
storage conditions (in the absence of organic acids)

Temperature and pressure affect the gas wettability of a particular
rock–fluid  system  on  a  polished  rock  surface  or  clean  mineral  [286,
372–377].  Some  studies  have  reported  that  pressure  highly  affects
CO2-wettability  by  increasing  CO2-wet  situations,  regardless  of  the
wetting  characteristics  and
type  [240,276,286,367,
372–374].  In  contrast,  several  studies  have  demonstrated  little  to  no
influence of the pressure on the contact angle [320,321,378].

formation

The influence of the temperature on contact angles differs and de-
pends on the formations. For example, the contact angle declines with
increasing temperatures in caprock (mica mineral) [276] or carbonate
(calcite mineral) formations [240] and rises with increasing tempera-
tures  in  sandstone  (quartz  mineral)  formations  [367].  Moreover,
wettability  has  demonstrated  various  behaviors  in  different  tempera-
tures;  for  instance,  with  increasing  temperatures,  the  contact  angle

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience95(2023)10106614

M. Aslannezhad et al.

increases  and  decreases  in  hydrophilic  and  hydrophobic  dolomite,
respectively  [379].  However,  this  perspective  glaringly  contradicts
several other studies [373,380–382]. In the following sections, the ef-
fects  of  the  temperature  and  pressure  on  H2  wettability  in  ideal
geo-storage  conditions  (pure  minerals)  are  discussed  in  much  more
detail.

4.1.1. Pure quartz

◦

◦

The injection of H2  into the aquifer displaces H2O, which is associ-
ated with θr  and corresponds to the structural storage capacity [317].
Capillary leakage can occur if θr is greater than 90
[206]. When H2 is
produced  again  at  later  stages  for  utilization,  it  is  displaced  by  H2O,
which  is correlated with θa  and associated with the  residual trapping
capacity (optimum residual trapping capacity is achieved when θa is less
than 50
) [316,383,384]. The contact angles for pure quartz increase
with  increased  pressure,  as  depicted  in  Fig.  17  [48].  The  advancing
◦
contact angles (θa) increased from 0
at
343  K  and  25  MPa.  This  finding  agrees  with  previous  experimental
studies for other gasses, such as Ar, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C3H8, He, N2, and
SF6 [285,372]. This behavior results from increased intramolecular in-
teractions of quartz and gas and increased molecular gas density [269,
385]. In addition, the contact angle increased with increased tempera-
ture. For example, θa at 10 MPa increased from 12.3
at
343 K. This trend is also similar to that observed by the measurement of
CO2, whose contact angle increased with the increased temperature of
pure quartz [372].

at 296 K and 0.1 MPa to 48.3

at 296 K to 33.7

◦

◦

◦

This outcome can be justified by the high probability of breaking the
bonds of H2 in silanol groups and H2O molecules at the surface of quartz
with increasing temperatures [386]. The decrease in the concentration
of the surface H2 bonds in quartz and H2O causes a decrease in the af-
finity between quartz and H2O. Therefore, the hydrophilicity of quartz is
decreased, resulting in higher H2 wettability. As displayed in Fig. 17, H2
is considerably less wetting than CO2. The lower density of H2  (ρH2) is
the main reason for this significant difference in wettability [48]. The
decrease in gas density leads to weaker intermolecular interactions be-
tween the quartz surface and gas [385].

4.1.2. Pure calcite

As  a  representative  of  carbonate  formations,  calcite  exists  abun-
dantly in caprocks and reservoir rocks [387,388]. Thus, residual trap-
ping  (for  calcite-rich  reservoir  rocks)  and  structural  trapping  (for

calcite-rich  caprock)  mechanisms  are  necessary  for  H2  storage  in
calcite-rich formations [240]. Fig. 18 indicates that θa  and θr  increase
with increasing pressure (i.e., water wettability decreases). For example,
◦
θa  rose from 0
(i.e., water-wet) under ambient conditions (298 K and
◦
(i.e., intermediate-wet) at 20 MPa and 298 K [389].
0.1 MPa) to 83.6
The increase in these contact angles agrees with the previous findings
[240,288,316–319,382].  This  behavior  is  described  by  the  increased
intermolecular forces in calcite and H2 at high pressures because of the
high gas density [385]. Similar behavior is illustrated in Fig. 18 for the
H2O/CO2/calcite  system.  Moreover,  the  same  behavior  has  been  re-
ported for the quartz/H2/brine and mica/H2/brine systems [18,390], in
which the contact angles of these systems are smaller than those of the
calcite/H2/brine system. This behavior is in agreement with that of CO2
systems,  including  the  calcite/CO2/brine  [240],  quartz/CO2/brine
[367], and mica/CO2/brine [276] systems.

The influence of temperature on the contact angles is presented in
Fig. 18. Both θa  and θr  decline with increasing temperatures (i.e., the
increase in the water wettability of calcite) [389]. Similar trends have
been reported for CO2 [240,382]. This behavior is due to decreasing the
H2  density  with  the  temperature  [250].  Another  possible  cause  of
decreasing  the  contact  angle  with  the  temperature  is  the  increased
rock–H2  IFT with temperature. The molecular cohesive energy density
(CED)  of  H2  decreases  as  the  temperature  rises;  however,  it  remains
constant for calcite [240]. Therefore, the H2 wettability of calcite is an
essential factor in examining the  storage capacity of carbonate layers
and  ensuring  containment  security  because  it  determines  the  storage
height or maximum column height [349,391].

4.1.3. Pure mica

Recent studies on a given mica/H2/brine system have already proven
that  wettability  is  significantly  affected  by  pressure  and  temperature
[250]. This behavior is similar to the wetting characteristics of mica/-
CO2/brine  systems  [276,283,293,316,382,392-394].  As  depicted  in

density, and the wettability of the quartz/H2/brine system depends on
the broken H2 bonds between the H2O molecules and silanol groups on
the quartz surface at elevated temperatures [372,386].

4.1.4. Pure sandstone

Only a few studies have been conducted for sandstone minerals to
measure the contact angles  of rock/H2/brine systems  in underground
storage  conditions  [46,48,395].  Hashemi  et  al.  [395]  conducted  an
experimental study using the captive bubble technique to determine the
contact angle of sandstone/H2/brine, which applies to UHS. Fig. 20 il-
lustrates the effects of various temperatures and pressures on the contact
angle of the Bentheimer/H2/brine system in the presence and absence of
NaCl. No clear relation was observed because all data points were within
the accuracy range of the performed experiments. The contact angles of
the  sandstone/H2/brine  system  are  not  influenced  by  pressure,  tem-
perature,  or  salinity.  In  all  conditions,  sandstone  wettability  was  not
affected by the presence of H2. All findings represented water-wet states

Fig. 19, θa  and θr  increase with increased pressure, resulting from the
greater molecular density of H2  at increased pressures. This phenome-
non can improve intermolecular interactions between solid surfaces and
gas  [241,394].  Consequently,  the  increased  pressure  enhances  the
intramolecular interaction between the mica substrate and H2 gas. As an
example, θr and θa on pure mica substrate are 18.3
at 5 MPa
and  323  K.  However,  when  the  pressure  increased  to  20  MPa  at  the

The low mica/H2 contact angle compared to the contact angle of the
mica/CO2  system  is  because  of  the  low  H2  density  compared  to  the
density of CO2  at the same pressure and temperature [46,48,248,249,
395]. For example, at 25 MPa and 323 K, the densities of CO2 and H2 are
834.9 and 16.4 kg/m3, respectively [48,396,397].

According to Fig. 19, the mica/H2/brine contact angle reduced with
increased temperature, indicating that the warmer reservoir has a higher
sealing capacity. For instance, at the constant pressure of 15 MPa, θr and
θa  were 47.3
and
35.4
, respectively. Similar trends were reported for CO2; however, the
variation level was greater than for H2. This finding is defined by the
decrease in the density of the H2  gas while increasing the temperature
[250]. For example, raising the temperature to 343 K, at the constant
pressure of 25 MPa, reduced the densities of CO2  and H2  to 737.7 and
15.5 kg /m3, respectively [48,396,397].

◦

The molecular CED of H2  decreases at high temperatures; thus, the
density of H2 gas declines at high temperatures. When H2 molecules are
heated, they gain kinetic energy, increasing the motion in gas molecules
and  resulting  in  stronger  collisions  and  accelerated  diffusion  (rapid
movement). Therefore, the molecular interaction between H2  and the
mica surface is reduced, increasing the water wettability with temper-
ature (decreasing the H2O contact angle) [250]. This behavior matches
that of calcite/H2/brine [389], but the contact angle of quartz/H2/brine
increases with the temperature because of the high silanol groups on the
surface [48]. This finding reveals that, like the calcite/H2/brine system,
the wettability of the mica/H2/brine system strongly depends on the H2

4.1.5. Pure basalt

For  basalt,  the  contact  angle  for  H2  can  increase  with  increased
pressure [241,248,316,367,372]. In addition, all predicted contact an-
gles for H2  are smaller than those for CO2, N2, and He with pressures
above 0 MPa, in the following order: CO2  > N2  > He > H2  (Fig. 21).
Thus, the basalt surface is highly water-wet in the presence of H2 [400]
with the largest capillary and residual trapping in its pores under storage
conditions [269,384,401].

Under storage conditions (i.e., 323 K and 20 MPa), the solubilities of
H2,  He,  N2,  and  CO2  at  molar  concentrations  (m)  are  about  0.139  m
[402], 0.078 m [403], 0.55 m [404], and 1.39 m [405], respectively. In
addition, both He and H2 have much lower solubility than N2 and CO2.
In comparison, the contact angle data (θ) obtained from the reported
capillary pressure and relative permeability measurements of the H2/
H2O system of sandstone at two storage conditions, deep (i.e., 318 K and
10 MPa) and shallow (i.e., 293 K and 5.5 MPa), are respectively equal to

0.82 (θ ~ 35
) [398]. Therefore, the data reported for
sandstone in various storage conditions also highly represent water-wet
conditions.

Cheap cushion gas (e.g., N2) must be injected before injecting H2 to
maintain the geological pressure to extract the stored H2 at high rates to
meet  high  peak  demand.  Cushion  gas  provides  pressure  support  and
improves the efficiency of the H2 production cycle [25,38,406]. A slight
H2  loss due to mixing with cushion gas is expected. However, this has
little  effect  on  the  economy  and  containment  security  during  the
injection-withdrawal  cycle.  As  depicted  in  Fig.  21,  the  water-wetting
state of basalt/H2/brine is considerably higher than that of N2. A rela-
tively  large  amount  of  N2  wetting  may  be  more  beneficial  for  stable
withdrawal  than  H2  wetting  because  increased  N2  wetting  conditions
have some advantages for further N2 injection to maintain the formation
pressure [248].

The  contact  angles  in  Table  2  can  be  calculated  using  the  known
densities of H2. For this purpose, Eq. (20) is applied using advancing and
receding contact angles, determined using experimental methods [407,
408]:

calculated from the known densities of H2 at various pressures.

Hosseini et al. [414] measured the contact angles of basalt/H2/brine
in
the  presence  and  absence  of  organic  matter  at  various
physical-thermal conditions (i.e., 308 to 343 K and 5 to 20 MPa). Based
on the experimental contact angle data, they calculated the H2 column
height, where H2 can be safely stored in the basalt layer. They concluded
that  basalts  can  be  slightly  water-wet  (at  low  pressure)  to  highly
water-wet (at low pressure) in the presence of H2. Therefore, the height
of the H2  column, determined under geo-storage conditions, indicates
that  basalt  is  a  potential  candidate  for  H2  geo-storage.  Organics  can

significantly affect wettability; thus, the possible presence of organics in
basalt should be considered.

◦
Although  all  measured  contact  angles  were  below  90

in  their
experiment, even at high stearic acid concentrations, the increased H2
wettability of basalts with organic acid concentrations reduced the H2
column  height.  Furthermore,  the  contact  angle  of  the  H2  system  is
smaller than that of the CO2 system so that, under the same geo-storage
conditions,  more  H2  can  be  safely  stored  in  basalts  compared  to  CO2
[414].

4.1.6. Pure clay mineral

For  all  clay-gas  combinations,  the  contact  angle  increases  with
pressure, as depicted in Fig. 22. These results agree with the literature
data for quartz [48,385] and other mineral/gas systems [286,317, 410],
resulting from an increase in the intramolecular interaction between the
gas and clay surface at high pressure [269,415]. As a result, the contact
angle  is  also  low  for  low-density  gas.  All  three  clay  minerals  (i.e.,
montmorillonite,  illite,  and  kaolinite)  generally  demonstrated  strong
◦
wettability with a contact angle of less than 40
Kaolinite exhibited a
lower  contact angle than illite, followed  by montmorillonite with the
highest  contact  angle  value  (i.e.,  montmorillonite  has  the  lowest
water-wetting state).

As  illustrated  in  Fig. 22,  the  contact  angle  of  the  CO2  system  was
significantly  higher.  In  addition,  the  contact  angles  of  the  clay/CH4/
brine  system  for  montmorillonite  and  kaolinite  [398]  were  highly
similar to those of the clay/H2/brine system [253], probably due to the
very  low  density  of  CH4.  Because  of  the  different  clay  structures  and
basal planes, it is reasonable to associate different wettabilities with the
diverse surface chemistries of clay. A more hydrophilic surface yields a
lower  contact  angle  of  the  H2O/gas  system;  however,  a  more  hydro-
phobic surface causes a larger contact angle [269].

Typically,  the montmorillonite contact angle  was  one-third higher
than the kaolinite contact angle under various H2  pressures (Table 3).
These findings are quantitively consistent with the literature data for a
clay/CO2/brine system under the same experimental conditions [410].
The  contact  angles  (θ)  in  Table  3  can  be  calculated  using  the  known
densities of H2, as explained in the previous section regarding basalt.

pressure, and the contact angles remain less than 40
conditions,  depending  on  the  clay  type.  This  outcome  indicates  that
residual  and  structural  trapping  of  H2  is  preferred  in  clay  minerals,
which  is  particularly  significant  because  clays  comprise  most  of  the
caprock, such as shale [253]. Similarly, the interaction of brine and rock
is critical in the presence of H2. Hydrogen may not wet the surface of the

clay/rock; however, it dissolves in the brine. Although H2  solubility is
low, the pressure in deep reservoirs can be high enough, leading to a
high concentration of dissolved H2.

Nevertheless, the influence of dissolved salt on H2  solubility is still
controversial [253]. De Lucia et al. [417] revealed that, in the presence
of up to 20% salinity, the H2 concentration measured experimentally is
higher  than  that  predicted  by  the  equation  of  states.  The  local  redox
environment is affected by these submolar concentrations, leading to the
rapid  reductive  dissolution  of  minerals  [418–422].  More  research
should be directed toward understanding the main redox reactions that
determine the fate of underground H2 and, thus, the predictions for the
long-term storage of H2.

4.2. Effect of pressure on contact angles in real geo-storage conditions (in
the presence of organic acids)

Storage  formations  have  organic  acids  in  small  quantities,  which
tend  to  increase  the  hydrophobicity  of  geo-storage  formations  [224].
Nevertheless, limited data exist regarding the effects of the types and
concentrations  of  organic  acid  on  H2  wettability  and  the  structural
trapping  capacity.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  experimental  or
simulation  studies  have  investigated  the  effect  of  temperature  on  the
contact angles of rock/H2/brine systems for actual geo-storage condi-
tions  where  the  influence  of  organic  acids  on  the  rock  surface  is
considered. Organic acids are readily available in geo-storage layers, as
geological  layers  are  oxygen-free  where  reductive  circumstances  are
overcome [46,49,238,365,366,423]. The presence of organic matter in
underground reservoirs and caprock is minimal, but its fine presence is
adequate to convert the initial hydrophilic state of storage formations to
a hydrophobic state (i.e., gas-wet). This conversion considerably affects
the  potential  of  H2  trapping  and  containment  security  [46,238,365,
366].

The  existence  of  organic  acids  in  underground  geo-storage  forma-
tions is theorized to be a potential ancestor of hydrocarbon evolution,
resulting from the availability of organic substances in biological ma-
terials  and  analogous  molecular  structures  [234,424].  Organic  acids
may include saturated linear mono- and dicarboxylic acids and unsat-
urated linear and branched fatty acids [219,235]. Several studies have
experimentally demonstrated the existence of trace amounts of organic
acids in deep aquifers due to fossil biodegradation and organic diagen-
esis  [218,236,425].  Generations  of  organic  acids  in  fossils  can  range
from  C2  to  C26  [424],  and  even-numbered  organic  carbon  acids  are
more available than odd-numbered ones [234]. These consist of acetic
(C2), butanoic (C4), hexanoic (C6), caprylic (C8), lauric (C12), myristic
(C14),  palmitic  (C16),  stearic  (C18),  behenic  (C22),  lignoceric  (C24),
and cerotic (C26) acids [217,374,377,426-431].

Thus far, all wettability studies in the presence of organic acids have
been associated with rock/oil/brine systems for enhanced oil recovery
processes [432] and rock/CO2/brine systems [45]. However, few studies
have  focused  on  the  effects  of  these  organic  acids  on  specific  rock/-
H2/brine systems. Thus, a thorough review of these studies assessing the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience95(2023)10106618

effects of organic acids on the wettability of H2/brine in various rock
minerals  is  essential.  This  section  describes  how  the  contact  angle  is
affected by mineral substrates containing organic acids. This result is the
case  for  actual  geo-storage  formations  containing  organic  acids,
although  different  formations  have  distinct  organics  with  various
concentrations.

4.2.1. Quartz substrate

Organic acids should be exposed to rock surfaces for specific periods
to simulate real scenarios for geological formations [46,48,224,282,365,
366,423]. Fig. 23 indicates that the contact angle of brine increases with
organic  acid  concentration.  Thus,  the  wettability  of  H2  increased
significantly.  As  illustrated  in  Fig.  23a,  the  surface  organic  acid  con-
centration had an apparent effect on the wettability of H2/quartz. As an
example, for a very realistic stearic acid concentration in a deep aquifer
(cid:0) 2 mol/L) [217–219], θr and θa at 323 K and 15 MPa were 63.4
◦
(i.e., 10

bility  of  H2)  declines  monotonically  with  a  decrease  in  organic  acid

concentration. However, even in minute concentrations (10
323  K  and  25  MPa,  organic  acids  have  a  considerable  effect  on  the
contact angles (e.g., θr = 41.7
for stearic-aged quartz vs.
◦
θr = 35.1
for pure quartz) [48]. These trends agree well
with the data reported for CO2 [365]. The behavior occurs because the
hydrophobicity of the quartz surface increases due to adsorbing organic
acids, leading to the dewetting of the quartz surface [415].

when the quartz is aged with 10

, respectively. In other words, the quartz surface repre-
sents  weakly/intermediate  water-wet  conditions.  Thus,  a  decrease  in
water wettability indicates a decrease in the residual trapping capacity
of H2 (i.e., θa > 50

The  tendency  of  wettability  changes  in  quartz  samples  aged  with
lauric acid is similar to that of wettability changes observed in samples
aged with hexanoic acid. For example, the contact angle of quartz/H2/

lauric  acid,  indicating  longer  alkyl  chains  (more  carbon  atoms)  in
organic  acid  and  resulting  in  less  water-wetting  of  the  quartz  surface
[46].

(cid:0) 9 M lauric acid is lower than that aged with 10

Interestingly, the tendency of wettability changes in lignoceric-aged
quartz  substrates  is  comparable  to  that  of  hexanoic  and  lauric-aged
substrates, but the magnitude of the wettability change is greater. The
change is greatly amplified due to long alkyl chains [423]. For example,
(cid:0) 2 mol/L lignoceric-aged quartz are respectively 82.7

(Fig. 23b) [46].

◦
and 55.6

At 323 K and 25 MPa, the H2 wettability of substrates aged in organic
acids is greater than that of pure quartz, even if aged in trace amounts
(cid:0) 9  M). Even minute amounts of organic acid can affect the wetta-
(10
bility of H2 under storage circumstances. This finding is similar to that
reported for the wettability of CO2 [48,236,423,425].

The reason for this influence is that the adsorption of organic acids
on the surface increases the hydrophobicity of the rock surface and in-
creases the contact angle of H2O [18,93]. Similar trends can be observed
in Fig. 24 for a H2O/CO2/calcite system at 10 MPa and 323 K, where
(cid:0) 2 mol/L causes θr

respectively.  The  reduction  of  water  wettability  with  the  increasing
stearic acid concentration agrees well with the mica/H2/brine [250] and
quartz/H2/brine systems [48]. The contact angles of these systems are
lower  than  those  of  the  calcite/H2/brine  system  because  the  calcite
surface is less hydrophilic than quartz and mica [250]. Consequently,
the contact angle of calcite is expected to be larger, and the calcite/H2
interface energy is expected to be lower [389].

4.2.3. Mica substrate

Understanding the wetting properties of geological formations and
caprock  is  essential  to  study  the  structural  and  residual  trapping  ca-
pacity of the H2 geo-storage potential [46]. Mica is an excellent caprock
mineral abundant in the shale caprock layer and has a chemical struc-
ture similar to illite [276,316,394]. A typical caprock plays the role of an
efficient seal. Therefore, the caprock is ideally highly water-wet to limit
the upward movement of H2  optimally. If θr  > 90
(H2-wet state), H2
moves to the caprock and can permeate the caprock, increasing the risk
of leakage. Therefore, the structural sealing potential of caprock can be
strongly affected by organic acids [46,206,238,241,366,423].

Ali et al. [250] demonstrated through experiments on pure mica that
if the influence of organic acids on the rock surface is not considered, the
mica  substrate  is  highly  water-wet  in  high-temperature  environments
and  remains  slightly  water-wet  in  low-temperature  environments.
However, when the mica sample was aged with various concentrations
of  acids,  higher  contact  angles  were  obtained  for  the  mica/H2/brine
system  (Fig.  25).  As  depicted  in  Fig.  25a,  the  H2  wettability  of  mica
increases with increased pressure and concentrations of stearic acid at a
constant temperature of 323 K. For example, at 323 K and 15 MPa, when
(cid:0) 2 mol/L, θr and
the stearic acid concentration increases from 10

wettability  of  mica  is  lower  than  its  CO2  wettability  under  the  same
conditions because of the lower density of H2 compared to CO2 and that
CO2 can be used as a cushion gas for H2 storage [46,248].

The  findings  indicate  that  the  structural  trapping  capacity  of  the
caprock is inevitably reduced at high pressures and in the presence of
organic  acids.  This  reduced  capacity  results  in  H2  leakage  from  the
caprock due to negative upward suction forces [46,238,365,423,434].
The high hydrophobicity of the mica sample is due to the covalent bonds
between the mica surface and hydroxyl groups of organic acids [365,
366,423].

root mean square = 341, 466, and 588 nm). They reported that, at 15
MPa  and  323  K,  both  θa  and  θr  slightly  decreased  with  an  increased
surface roughness (Fig. 26b). This reduction in the contact angles agrees
with the calcite/CO2/brine [240] and quartz/CO2/brine [372] systems,
indicating that rough surfaces are more water-wet than smoother sur-
faces. This effect is due to the penetration of the liquid into the surface
grooves  [442,443].  Consequently,  increasing  the  surface  roughness
improves the wettability resulting from the surface chemistry, but other
surface  parameters,  including  adsorption/desorption,  energy  dissipa-
tion, and the surface shape, can also influence wettability [389].

The effects of the rock type on the contact angles of a rock/H2/H2O
system  were  investigated  only  once  for  Berea  and  Bentheimer  sand-
stones [395]. However, no clear relation was observed between them
because all data points were within the accuracy range of the conducted
experiments.

4.3. Effect of salinity, surface roughness, and rock type on contact angles

5. Interfacial tension measurements of H2/Fluid systems

Hashemi et al. [395] investigated the effects of salinity (i.e., 0, 5000,
and 50,000 ppm of NaCl) at four pressures ranging from 20 to 100 bar
◦
and a constant temperature of 30
C. They concluded that changing the
salinity did not lead to a significant alteration in the measured contact
angle, indicating that the wetting state of the rock in the presence of H2
is insensitive to salinity [395]. In contrast, Hosseini et al. [389] reported
that  both  θa  and  θr  increased  slightly  with  salinity  (decreased  water
wettability; Fig. 26a). The reduction of water wettability due to salinity
is  in  agreement  with  the  calcite/CO2/brine  [240],  quartz/CO2/brine
[320],  coal/CO2/brine  [435],  and  mica/CO2/brine  [276]  systems.
Higher salinity also increases the number of ions (i.e., reduced surface
polarity)  required  to  neutralize  the  surface  charge  of  rock  substrates,
facilitating  surface  dewetting  [240,269,276].  This  effect  can  also  be
examined for divalent ions, which exhibit a higher increase in both θa
and θr  than monovalent ions [372]. As the salt concentration or ionic
potential increases, so does the zeta potential [240,394]. Consequently,
the  higher  electrolyte  concentration  leads  to  more  effective  shielding
and surface dewetting [436,437].

Surface  roughness  affects  wettability  [286,372,438].  Surface
roughness influences the wetting states in geo-storage formations and
governs parameters related to H2  storage and the production process,
including the front geometry of the H2/brine displacement, fluid flow
patterns, and the efficiency of structural trapping [439–441]. Hosseini
et al. [389] studied the effect of surface roughness on contact angles for
three pure calcite samples with various surface roughness values (e.g.,

The  phase  boundaries  of  immiscible  fluids  are  determined  by  the
intermolecular  interactions  between  the  molecules  and  the  types  of
molecules on either side of the boundary. The IFT between phases (γFF)
is a crucial characteristic of the phase boundaries because it determines
the  energy  required  to  create  more  interfaces  [33].  The  accurate  ex-
amination of the H2–brine IFT under reservoir conditions is necessary
because  it  affects  the  capillary  sealing  efficiency  of  reservoir  seals
(caprocks) and influences the structural and residual trapping capacity
for gas storage [276,444]. The IFT also controls the fluid flow and dis-
tribution mechanisms in porous media [281].

The  measurements  of  IFTs  for  brine  and  CO2  systems  have  been
extensively  studied  for  geo-storage  purposes  [276,281,391,445,446];
however, there is limited γ data for brine and H2 systems at high pres-
sures,  high  temperatures,  and  high salinities  [447].  Few  studies  have
investigated  the  IFT  between  H2  and  other  rock/liquid  systems  [282,
448-451]. Pan et al. [282] used a semi-empirical method to calculate the
IFT of rock–gas (γrock(cid:0) gas) for H2, CO2, and CH4. They concluded that
γrock(cid:0) gas follows the order of H2 > CH4 > CO2. In addition, Chow et al.
[350] examined the IFTs of H2O/H2  and H2O/H2/CO2  systems at the
pressure  and  temperature  values  of  45  MPa  and  298  K  to  448  K,
respectively.  The  experimental  results  for  the  H2O–H2  IFT  (γH2(cid:0) H2O)
indicate that γFF depends on fluid composition, temperature, and pres-
sure.  As  depicted  in  Fig.  27,  γH2(cid:0) H2O  remains  almost  constant  with
increasing  pressure,  but  it  decreases  significantly  with  increasing

temperature. Increasing the pressure from 0.5 MPa to 45 MPa at 298 K
decreased γH2(cid:0) H2O from 72 to 68 mN/m. However, at the pressure of 20
MPa,  when  the  temperature  elevated  from  298  K  to  448  K,  γH2(cid:0) H2O
reduced from 72 to 44 mN/m [350].

In  addition,  γH2(cid:0) H2O  was  also  determined  by  fitting  the  H2/H2O/
sandstone coreflooding data (obtained at 293 K with 5.5 MPa and 318 K
with  10  MPa)  with  relevant  mercury-injected  capillary  pressure  data
[398].  However,  the  directly  measured  γH2–H2O  values  were  consid-
erably higher than the estimated values [350]. This significant differ-
ence between the estimation and direct measurement results could be
due  to the  known systematic errors  related to  the conversion  of  such
mercury data [452–454].

The brine salinity influences the H2–brine IFT under ambient con-
ditions [350,455]. The IFT of H2–H2O increases considerably and line-
arly  with  an  increase  in  the  salinity  at  a  constant  temperature  and
pressure [447]. This outcome agrees well with the trends of CH4 and CO2
[391,445,446,456].  In  addition,  salinity  can  considerably  increase
saltwater  density  as  more  salt  is  packed  into  the  H2O.  At  a  constant
temperature and pressure, H2 has a low density and high Δρ, resulting in
a higher IFT than CO2 and CH4. Overall, salinity has more influence on
IFT than pressure but less influence than temperature [447].

6. Rock–Fluid interfacial tension measurements for rock/fluid
systems

The IFT of rock–fluid (γrock(cid:0) fluid) is an essential parameter in gas geo-
storage,  which  controls  the  diffusion  and  flow  of  fluids  in  a  porous
medium and the gas storage capacity, gas injection/production rate, and
containment safety [457]. Therefore, to mitigate the risk of H2 storage
projects,  a  good  understanding  of  the  interfacial  properties  of  the
rock/fluid system is necessary.

6.1. Pure quartz–fluid interfacial tension

The  IFT  of  pure  quartz/H2  (γquartz(cid:0) H2)  decreases  with  increasing
temperature  and  pressure  [282].  As  depicted  in  Fig.  28,  at  323  K,
γquartz(cid:0) H2 decreases to 88 from 101 mN/m as the pressure increases from
5 to 25 MPa. It decreases to 83 from 92 mN/m as the temperature rises
from 323 to 343 K. This effect of temperature and pressure on γquartz(cid:0) H2
agrees  with  that  of  γquartz(cid:0) CO2  [281],  γquartz(cid:0) CH4  [284],  and
γsandstone(cid:0) CO2  [363].  However,  as  the  molecular  weight  of  the  gas  in-
creases, the effect of temperature is suppressed. For instance, at 20 MPa,
when the temperature increases from 323 to 343 K, γquartz(cid:0) CO2 decreases
from 20 to 17 mN/m. Further, under similar thermophysical conditions,
γquartz(cid:0) H2  is greater than γquartz(cid:0) CH4, which is greater than γquartz(cid:0) CO2
[282].

Fig. 28. Effects of temperature and pressure on the pure quartz–gas interfacial
tension. (Reprinted from [282] with permission of the Elsevier).

At  a  constant  temperature  and  pressure  with  a  similar  gas  type,
γquartz(cid:0) H2  is greater than γbasalt(cid:0) H2  [282]. In the case of a specific gas
type with a rise in pressure and reduction in temperature, the gas density
and  rock–gas  intermolecular  forces  increase  [285,286],  reducing
γrock(cid:0) gas  [284]. Under the same thermophysical conditions, in various
gas types, the gas density follows the order of H2  < CH4  < CO2. This
result agrees with the recent literature data [198]. Moreover, γrock(cid:0) gas is
affected  by  fluid  and  rock  properties  for  certain  gasses  under  similar
temperature  and  pressure  conditions.  Ionic  strength  has  only  a  small
effect on rocks [281], so rock properties are the only factors affecting
γrock(cid:0) gas [282].

6.2. Pure mica–h2  interfacial tension

The IFT of pure mica–gas (γSG) reduces with an increase in pressure
for H2 (Fig. 29). For example, at 323 K, increasing the pressure from 5 to
20 MPa, the γSG decreases from 114 to 95 mN/m [361]. The findings also
qualitatively agree with the pressure effects on the IFT of quartz/gas and
basalt/gas systems [282,284]. However, the effect of temperature on γSG

interfacial tension. (Adapted from [361] with permission of the Elsevier).

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience95(2023)10106622

M. Aslannezhad et al.

is dependent upon the gas type. At 10 MPa, γSG of H2 decreases from 111
to  102  mN/m  when  the  temperature  rises  from  308  to  343  K.  The
decrease in mica–gas IFT with increasing pressure may be due to the
adhesion of H2  to the mica surface, resulting from the increase in the
CED of H2. These interactions are advantageous for the mica/gas system,
improving the mica–H2 wettability [281].

For  certain  gas  types  (such  as  H2),  the  gas  density  and  rock–gas
intramolecular forces increase with increased pressure [285,286], and
γSG decreases accordingly [284]. For some gas types, the CO2 density is
greater than that of H2  under the same pressure and temperature con-
ditions. Therefore, γSG follows the reverse order, and γSG of H2 is higher
than  that  of  CO2.  These  results  are  consistent  with  recently  reported
results  on  the  effect  of  gas  density  on  the  quartz–H2,  shale–CO2,  and
basalt–CO2  IFTs  [198,282,328].  The  IFT  of  mica  decreases  with  an
increased carbon number and an increased organic acid concentration
because the strong adsorption of organic acids reduces the energy bar-
rier for gas molecules to reach the mica surface [361].

6.3. Pure calcite–h2  interfacial tension

The  IFT  of  rock–gas  (γrock(cid:0) gas) for  H2/H2O systems  increases  with
increasing temperature (Fig. 30). These results agree quantitively with
the IFTs of coal/CO2, mica/CO2, and quartz/CO2 systems [281,284] but
do not agree with the IFTs of quartz/CH4 and quartz/H2  systems [52].
This result confirms that the effect of temperature on γrock(cid:0) gas depends
on the gas type. The increased γrock(cid:0) gas  with temperature is due to the
decreased CED of the gas with temperature [458], but the CED of the
rock  is  assumed  to  be  constant  at  various  temperatures  [459].  This
outcome  causes  an  increase  in  the  discrepancy  between  rock–gas
cohesive  energies  at  high  temperatures,  adversely  affecting  the  inter-
action between rock and gas [362].

As  depicted  in  Fig.  30,  the  γcalcite(cid:0) gas  values  for  H2/H2O  systems
decrease with increasing pressure at various temperatures. This reduc-
tion  agrees  well  with  the  literature  data  [198,281,282,284,328,362],
which can be justified by a decrease in the discrepancy between cohesive
rock–gas energies at high pressure. This result is due to increasing the
CED  of  the  gas,  which  approaches  the  CED  of  the  rock,  leading  to  a
desirable interaction between the rock and gas [362].

It is also vital to examine the effects of the salinity and organic acid
concentration on the rock–gas IFT. When the brine salinity increases at a
constant temperature and pressure, the γrock(cid:0) gas  decreases slightly for
the H2/H2O system but remains constant for the CO2/H2O system [457].

This outcome is consistent with the literature data [281], indicating that
salinity  does  not  significantly  affect  γrock(cid:0) gas.  In  addition,  when  the
organic acid concentration increases at constant temperature and pres-
sure,  γrock(cid:0) gas  decreases  for  both  the  H2/H2O  and  CO2/H2O  systems
[457]. This reduction is also consistent with quartz/CO2 and quartz/H2
systems [282], contributing to the fact that gas molecules require less
energy  to  propagate  on  the  rock  surface  because  hydrophobicity  in-
creases with an increased organic acid concentration [457].

7. Adsorption and desorption of H2  in coal seam reservoirs and
shale formations

It is critical to determine a new solution for large-scale H2  storage.
One option is UHS, where H2  can be stored in subsurface formations,
such as depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs or saline aquifers [48,205,224,
249,250,395]. Coal seams may be the most appropriate option for these
underground  formation  types  because  they  have  very  fine  structures.
These structures can adsorb large amounts of H2 or other gasses that can
be recovered whenever needed [259,460].

This process is like CH4 storage in subsurface geological coal seams.
Methane has been geologically adsorbed on the coal surface over time
and is now a resource produced through the production of CBM [254,
461]. Related to this is the increase in CBM production, where CO2  is
injected into deep coal seams. In addition, CO2 replaces more CH4 while
being  adsorbed  on  the  coal  surface  [259,462].  Iglauer  et  al.  [249]
determined  H2  adsorption  in  a  typical  bituminous  coal  sample  and
revealed that this approach could store significant amounts of H2 even at
moderate pressures. Increasing pressure caused a dramatic increase in
H2 adsorption (Fig. 31). Initially, this increase was very rapid; however,
the adsorption curve reached a plateau at about 4 MPa. Therefore, at a
low pressure of 0.1 MPa, only a small amount of H2 was adsorbed (0.005
mol/kg coal), but at a pressure of 3.38 MPa, about 0.23709 mol H2/kg
coal was adsorbed (i.e., an increase of 47,418 times). The amount of H2
adsorption increased 120,000 times, as pressure increased from 11.74
(at 303 K) to 14.3207 MPa (at 318 K).

Keshavarz  et  al.  [200]  measured  the  H2  adsorption  rate  of  an
Australian  anthracite  coal  sample  under  isothermal  conditions  at
various temperatures and an equilibrium pressure of 13 bar. The results
revealed  that  the  H2  adsorption  rate  increases  with  temperature.  The
adsorption of H2 achieves equilibrium faster at high temperatures. This
faster  equalization  is  because  of  an  increase  in  the  molecular  kinetic
energy of the gas at higher temperatures, resulting in a faster diffusion of
gas molecules into the micropores and nanopores of coal [463–465]. Gas

diffusion in coal is a recognized phenomenon [260,261,466,467], but
there is a severe lack of data on H2 diffusion in coal, primarily because of
the novelty of the H2 geo-storage operations [200].

The adsorption capacity of CO2 was considerably greater than that of
H2  (about five times) at various temperatures. In addition, the adsorp-
tion capacity of both gasses decreased slightly with increasing temper-
ature,  as  depicted  in  Fig.  32.  This  discrepancy  between  adsorption
capacities is because the quadrupole moment of CO2 is much higher than
that of H2. As a result, CO2 has a greater affinity for coal than H2 [200].
The quadrupole moment represents the distribution of a charge through
a  molecule,  which  is  the  gradient  of  the  electric  field  through  the
molecule  [468,469].  The  basic  functional  groups  in  coal,  such  as  hy-
droxyl and carbonyl groups, are very complex materials and typically
improve the adsorption of H2 and CO2 [435,470,471]. In particular, the
oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is the main adsorption site [472]
because H2  has a good affinity for free electron-rich functional groups
[473]. Consequently, the carbonyl group is the active adsorption site for
H2 [474].

Due  to  their  adsorptive  trapping  mechanism,  organic-rich  shale
formations  have  been  proposed  as  suitable  geo-storage  sites  for  UHS.
Hydrogen is stored as an adsorbed phase on clay minerals or kerogen
surfaces  and  displaces  CH4  at  adsorption  sites  during  competitive
adsorption. Furthermore, CH4 has been proposed as a cushion gas for H2
[475].

Abid et al. [475] measured the adsorption capacities of H2 and CH4
with a PCTpro adsorption analyzer. Due to the presence of organic acids
in geological formations, they compared the adsorption capacities of H2
and CH4 in raw and aged shale in humic acid (shale-HA) to demonstrate
the effect of organic acids on gas adsorption. The results revealed a clear
difference  in  the  H2  adsorption  capacity  between  fresh  shale  and
shale-HA samples (Fig. 33).

The  adsorption  capacity  for  H2  increases  with  increasing  absolute
pressure until a plateau reaches a saturation pressure of 35 bar, indi-
cating no more H2 molecules are adsorbed on the shale. The affinity of
shale-HA  for  H2  adsorption  is  almost  equal  to  that  of  modified  sub-
bituminous coal [476]. The H2 adsorption capacity of shale-HA is very
competitive compared to some known adsorbents (e.g., activated carbon
[477]).  Moreover,  from  an  economic  viewpoint  [478],  shale-HA  is  a
potential adsorbent  for safely storing large amounts of H2  as a  cheap
subsurface storage facility.

8. Coreflooding of hydrogen in porous geological media

We  present  the  studies  in  which  H2  was  injected  into  porous
geological media. Until recently, little was understood about the rock
physics  of  H2  in  porous  media.  Few  studies  have  investigated  the
interaction  of  H2  with  rocks  and  fluids  in  reservoirs.  The  relative
permeability, depending on the capillary number, pore structure, and
surface  wettability,  is  essential  in  determining  the  gas  injection/pro-
duction rate [479]. Yekta et al. [398] studied the capillary pressure and
relative permeability of H2/H2O systems in porous media using Triassic
sandstone samples. As H2  storage is expected to occur at depths up to
1000 m under the surface [166], the experiments were conducted under
two  situations, indicating a  deep  depth  (i.e.,  100 bar  and  45
C) and
shallower depth (i.e., 55 bar, 20
C). As a result, the receding contact

angles  of  34.92
equation  with  air  and  mercury,  respectively.  The  experiment  demon-
strated that the H2O/H2/sandstone system is highly water-wet. More-
over,  there  was  no  direct  measurement  of  H2/H2O  wettability  in  the
system,  thus  these  characteristics  were  derived  from  the  capillary
pressure and empirical scaling rules [398].

Jha et al. [62] conducted the only contact angle measurement using
a 3D micro-CT coreflooding experiment, which assessed the H2 storage
possibilities in sandstone layers. The saturation values of brine and H2 at
low injection rates were nearly 35% and 65% of the rock pore volume,
respectively. As depicted in Fig. 34, the location of H2 after injection is
primarily in large pores, and brine remains in the corner points, small
pores, and pore throats after injection. In addition, Fig. 34 displays the
intrinsic wettability of the sandstone substrate in the presence of H2. The
curvature of the grain meniscus indicates that the sandstone is strongly
water-wet. Another piece of information that can be derived from the 2D
segmented image is the discrepancy in the brine phases during the initial
and residual H2  saturation. After brine flooding, about 41% of the H2
saturation was detected, implying that the H2 residual saturation in the
sandstone pores remains very high and that sandstone layers can be used
for possible long-term storage [62].

Al-Yaseri et al. [480] experimentally described multiphase H2 fluxes
in an aquifer scenario using a nuclear magnetic resonance coreflooding
system.  A  series  of  imbibition-drainage  cycles  were  performed  with
capillary numbers representing the flow in the reservoir. Nitrogen gas
was  also  used  for  comparison.  They  chose  a  homogenous  and  clean
sandstone core plug (quartz-rich) to avoid rock–fluid interactions during
the test. The results indicated that the initial and residual H2 saturation
was significantly lower than the N2 saturation regardless of whether the

injection rates were similar. Such a contrast of low residual trapping of
H2 is typically due to the lower H2 density with considerable influence
on the contact angle.

When evaluating an H2  geo-storage project, it is crucial to identify
how  much  H2  can  be  stored  in  an  appropriate  time  frame  and  how
quickly the H2 can be recovered [26]. Recent studies have reported that
a  significant  amount  of  H2  can  be  adsorbed  on  coal;  therefore,  the
storage capacity is high in principle. However, it is now unclear how
coal swelling and related coal permeability are influenced by H2 expo-
sure. Scarce data exist to evaluate UHS as a real economic engineering
option  [26,99].  Injecting  gas  into  coal  can  swell  the  coal  and  signifi-
cantly reduce its permeability. Iglauer et al. [481] injected H2 into a coal
core  and  measured  its  dynamic  permeability  while  imaging  the  core
using micro-CT under reservoir conditions. In contrast to CO2, the in-
jection of H2  did not alter the permeability or morphology of the coal
(Fig. 35). They found that H2 geo-storage at coal seams is possible from a
petrophysical viewpoint.

9. Field experience in underground hydrogen storage

Underground gas storage in salt caverns and porous formations is not
new and has been used for town gas (coal-H2 mixtures), natural gas, and,
more  recently,  CO2  [482].  In  2015,  it  was  reported  that  680  under-
ground  gas  storage  sites  were  in  operation  worldwide  [15].  Under-
ground storage of town gas has been regularly used, primarily without
published reports [162]. Pure H2 geo-storage is still limited, and only a
few geo-storage sites have been tested. Although storage in porous rocks
and aquifers has been carried out on a field-trial scale, only salt caverns
are in operation for H2 storage [162].

Although the experience with natural gas geo-storage can be adapted
to  other  gasses,  H2  geo-storage  requires  testing  and  research  before
implementing  this  method  on  the  industrial  scale  [164].  In  the  early
1970s,  the  first  salt  cavern  for  pure  H2  storage  was  constructed  near
Teesside, UK, and is still in operation. In the 1980s, three salt caverns
were constructed for H2 storage in Texas, USA [483].

Currently, several projects worldwide are at the designing or oper-
ational phase for H2 geo-storage. Table 4 and 5 summarize successfully
operating and potential H2 geo-storage sites, respectively, including salt
caverns, aquifers, and depleted oil and gas reservoirs.

10. Conclusions

Hydrogen is considered a future low-carbon fuel for electricity, heat
generation,  and  decarbonization  of  transportation  and  fuel-intensive
industries,  including  steel  and  chemicals.  The  method  of  storing  H2
differs  according  to  the  amount  of  H2  to  be  stored  and  the  storage
duration. One efficient method of large-scale storage is UHS. As part of
the recent search concerning the effective execution of an H2 economy,
this review is presented as a robust but concise description of porous
rock/H2/brine  interactions  in  UHS  to  accomplish  a  large-scale  H2
economy. Based on these studies, the outcomes are summarized below.

1)  Mica substrates tend to be slightly water-wet at a low temperature
and high pressure and intermediate-wet with an increased organic
acid  concentration.  These  results  confirm  the  excellent  sealing
properties  of  caprock  comprising  clayey  minerals.  In  addition,  to
guarantee secure and economic industrial-scale H2  storage, the in-
fluence of organic acids must be considered.

2) The optimal states for mitigating the risk of UHS in carbonate for-
mations are low salinity, high temperature, low pressure, and a low
organic acid concentration. However, intermediate wettability at a

low concentration of organic acids does not ensure safe and efficient
storage.  Under  actual  field  conditions,  the  risk  of  calcite-rich  for-
mations is higher for H2 storage projects than for other formations.
Thus, for an efficient H2 geo-storage project, it is essential to estimate
the influencing parameters.

3)  Innate  organic  acids  in  geo-storage  formations  may  affect  the
caprock seal capacity. The failure of H2 geo-storage projects can be
avoided  if  the  thresholds  of  organic  acid  concentrations  are
measured.

4)  A significant amount of H2 can be deposited on the coal surface as an
absorption phase at a moderate temperature and pressure. The ca-
pacity of H2 absorption on the coal surface can be further increased
at high pressure. Thus, H2 storage is potentially possible in deep coal
seams.

5)  A  saline  aquifer  in  a  sandstone  formation  is  advantageous  for  H2
storage  because  the  volume  of  H2  can  remain  intact  over  a  long
period until a gas with high rock-wettability is injected (e.g., cushion
gas injection for H2 recovery). In addition, increased N2-wettability
of the rock surface, compared to H2-wettability, may be beneficial for
H2 production by injecting N2 into the reservoir.

6) The high wettability of basalt in the presence of H2 can be very ad-
vantageous for structural and residual H2 storage. Low H2 dissolution
in brine further halts H2 loss because of the mineralization process. In
addition,  the  high  N2-wettability  of  basalt  causes  N2  to  be  an

appropriate cushion gas because it can be injected to maintain the
formation pressure for stable H2 production to meet demand.

11. Recommendations and future outlook

The  authors  recommend  that  more  focused  studies,  as  outlined

below, be conducted to lay the foundation for UHS:

1) In this paper, we reviewed several organic acids with various con-
centrations and evaluated their effects on rock–fluid interactions and
UHS. However, the actual composition of organic acids can vary due
to the availability of more organics in actual formations. Thus, the
precise examination of actual large-scale H2 geo-storage formations
is required to provide a comprehensive understanding.

2)  One challenge in UHS projects is that H2  readily reacts with other
gasses because of the catalytic action of bacteria. This chemical re-
action decreases H2 and CO2 and increases CH4 in the reservoir [13].
Thus, the investigation of methanogenesis and H2S production due to
the injection of H2  in porous media in the presence of bacteria and
other gasses is recommended.

3)  Because of the significant effect of bacterial metabolism on the purity
of  the stored  H2  [391], it  is  recommended to  examine the related
microbiological  properties  at  each  geo-storage  formation  to  accu-
rately assess the possibilities of microbial side effects on safe UHS.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience95(2023)10106626

M. Aslannezhad et al.

4)  To  date,  the  fluid–fluid  IFT  (γFF)  and  contact  angle  have  been
examined only for H2/H2O [350] and sandstone/H2/brine systems,
respectively  [48].  In  addition,  the  brine  salinity  and  the  types  of
rocks and minerals are crucial parameters affecting θ and γFF [269].
It is recommended that γFF and θ are assessed using in situ formation
rocks and brine under in situ physio-thermal conditions in diverse
geological  environments,  and  the  solid–fluid  IFT  (γSF)  should  be
calculated accordingly.

5)  Current studies have been conducted on synthetic rock samples (i.e.,
chemically cleaned rocks), such as mica, calcite, quartz, sandstone,
basalt,  and  clay  minerals.  However,  the  actual  geo-storage  forma-
tions are heterogeneous with various compositions. Accordingly, the
reported data and their applicability are limited. Thus, studies on H2
wettability should be conducted in actual geological formations to
determine the potential for H2 storage.

6)  Capillary pressure and relative permeability are critical parameters
controlling  the  H2  injection  and  production  efficiency.  However,
these have been examined only once for the sandstone system in the
literature  [398].  The  capillary  pressure  and  relative  permeability
must  be  measured  for  more  lithologies  and  physio-thermal  condi-
tions,  and  repeated  tests  are  required  as  a  benchmark  to  increase
certainty. We also require coreflooding for various other parameters,
such as the relationship between relative permeability and effective
porosity.

7)  An  in-depth  analysis  of  the  hysteresis  effect  is  required,  given  the
cyclic  behavior  of  H2  injection/production.  Hysteresis  analysis  fa-
cilitates  accurately  predicting  H2  injection  (primary  drainage),  H2
withdrawal  (secondary  imbibition),  and  H2  reinjection  (secondary
drainage).

8) The  adsorption  and  desorption  of  H2  on  clay/coal/shale  may  in-
crease the H2 storage capacity [131,392], and further investigation is
needed.

9)  It is also recommended to conduct reservoir models and simulation
studies, such as molecular simulation for H2 wettability, H2 solubil-
ity,  H2  density,  and  H2  storage  capacity  studies,  and  reservoir
simulation for the large-scale influence of these factors on the overall
economic viability.
