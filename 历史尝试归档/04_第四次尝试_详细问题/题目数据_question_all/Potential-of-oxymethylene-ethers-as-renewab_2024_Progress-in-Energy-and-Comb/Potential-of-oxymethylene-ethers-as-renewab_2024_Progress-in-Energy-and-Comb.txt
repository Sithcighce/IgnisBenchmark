Oxymethylene ethers (OMEx), are a promising renewable replacement fuel for compression ignition engines.
OMEx are largely compatible with current engines, can help to significantly reduce engine-out and tail-pipe
emissions while simultaneously reducing the transport sector’s net carbon emissions by gradually replacing
fossil diesel fuel. This paper aims to compile and critically review recent research progress on OMEx, following
the entire value chain from production to engine application. First, pathways for OMEx production are compiled
and compared regarding energy efficiency, fuel production costs and life cycle CO2 balance, showcasing
advantages and disadvantages of more advanced production pathways with reduced hydrogen consumption. On
the application side, chemical kinetics play a fundamental role in understanding OMEx combustion. Recent
progress in understanding the decomposition and combustion of OMEx is discussed and resulting detailed
chemical reaction mechanisms from the literature are investigated regarding their accuracy and capabilities.
Furthermore, the liquid fuel properties of OMEx are presented and compared with conventional fossil diesel fuel
as well as selected other renewable and surrogate fuels, pointing out possible issues and potentials for engine
application. In particular, material compatibility is discussed, and suitable sealing materials are identified.
Subsequently, the application of OMEx in CI engines is discussed in detail, including the fuel’s potential for
engine efficiency increase and significant decrease in engine-out particulate and NOx emissions. Necessary and
possible changes to engine design and control, such as longer injection duration or larger injector holes, are
outlined. Finally, on a high level, the potential for large-scale application of e-fuels such as OMEx is discussed,
and necessary political incentives are pointed out.

1. Introduction

Worldwide, transport was responsible for around 24 % of total CO2
emissions from fuel combustion in 2019, with road transport account-
ing for 74 % of those emissions [1]. Despite increasing efforts to improve
fuel economy and increasingly stringent regulations, CO2 emissions
from the transport sector have grown continuously every year for
the past two decades except during the economic crisis in 2009 and
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Growing populations and increas-
ing mobility in developing countries combined with a trend towards
larger and heavier vehicles in industrial countries counteracted the
technical progress in engine efficiencies. The fuel economy improve-
ment of light duty vehicles averaged 1.8 % per year between 2005
and 2016, but slowed down to 0.7 % already in 2017 [2], showcasing
that the remaining potential for CO2 reduction by engineering mea-
sures using established gasoline and diesel technology and fossil fuels
is becoming smaller. Assuming that the worldwide mobility demand
will keep increasing, the necessary reduction in CO2 emissions from
road transport to achieve the climate goals set in the Paris agree-
ment can only be achieved by breaking the strong coupling between

economic growth and transport fossil fuel consumption. This can be
achieved by a significant increase in battery-electric vehicles (BEVs)
or by replacing the fuel burnt in state-of-the-art internal combustion
engine vehicles (ICEVs) with either biofuels or fuels synthesized us-
ing renewable energy (commonly called e-fuels), or, most likely, a
combination of all three. The focus of this review is the e-fuel group
of oxymethylene ethers (OMEx), which are oxygenated hydrocarbon
molecules with repetitive ether functionalities that exist in different
sizes. Fig. 1 visualizes the corresponding molecular structure. OMEx
have major benefits as transportation fuels. While they are not carbon-
free, they can be carbon-neutral if made from captured CO2, and while
their production from renewable electricity shows energetic efficiencies
of only about 50 % [3–5], they are liquid with high energy densities
and have combustion properties very suitable for compression-ignition
engines. It will be shown below in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 that OMEx fuels
can be competitive in cost and production energy efficiency to other
liquid e-fuels suitable for CI engines.

Here, before discussing these molecules in more detail, we will first
provide the context by discussing the major technological alternatives
for future road transport, with their main advantages and disadvantages
regarding emissions and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction.

1.1. CO2-neutral transport

A multitude of technologies, ranging from BEVs and fuel cell electric
vehicles (FCEVs) over conventional ICEVs burning renewable gaseous
or liquid fuels to hybrid vehicles of different kinds, exists to transform
the transport sector towards sustainable, renewable energy utilization.
However, all of them have their own advantages and challenges, and
as of today, it is unlikely that there will be a single one-fits-all techno-
logical solution. Apart from the different vehicle engine concepts, also
the energy supply and energy storage in the supply chain need to be
considered.

BEVs have the strong advantages of a very high energy efficiency
as well as zero local emissions, excluding PM emissions from tire and
brake wear, and their net CO2 driving emissions are directly coupled to
the increasing share of renewable power in the electrical grid. However,
battery production is both resource- and energy-intensive [6], and due
to the much lower energy densities compared to common liquid fuels,
batteries add significant weight to vehicles [7]. The achievable range
of BEVs is therefore practically limited by economically and ecologi-
cally sensible battery sizes, and refueling requires significantly more
time compared to established ICEVs [8]. This makes them unattractive
for certain fields of application, as for example long-haul transport
[9], although this could change with increasingly competitive bat-
tery prices [10]. Additionally, long-distance transmission of electrical
energy is difficult, raising the need for significant renewable power-
generation expansion in regions with high consumption such as Central
Europe. However, these regions often also have high population density
and relatively low solar potential, resulting in limited potential for
renewable power generation. For example, for Germany in 2050, with
an assumed 67 % market share of BEV in the light vehicle fleet only,
the additional electricity demand for these vehicles would already
correspond to 10 % of the total electricity production [11]. Almost all of
this additional demand would have to be covered by renewable sources
for a net climate benefit. Hybrid vehicles with a combustion engine and
a smaller battery can bring together the advantages of both ICEVs and
BEVs and increase the overall efficiency of operation by recuperation
(among other things).

A wide range of options exist in terms of fuels for ICEVs and FCEVs.
All of them have in common that energy is stored chemically, and there-
fore with much higher energy density compared to BEVs. Particularly
liquid fuels have the advantage of an extremely high energy density,
enabling long-distance transport with negligible losses, geographically
decoupling the fuel production from consumption and enabling global
trade. Renewable liquid fuels can thus be produced and exported by
countries with beneficial conditions, i.e. large agricultural potential for
biofuels or high potential for solar and wind power.

Biofuels are produced either from dedicated food crops (first gen-
eration biofuels) or from lignocellulosic or waste biomass (second
generation biofuels). The resulting fuel can be burnt in common ICEVs
and is often used in fuel blends with regular fossil fuel, e.g. ethanol in
gasoline, or biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester, FAME) or hydrotreated
vegetable oil (HVO) in diesel fuel. An overview of biofuel application in
CI engines can be found in Agarwal et al. [12]. First generation biofuels

came under scrutiny due to competition with food production [13],
and the potential for second generation biofuels is limited by the
availability of biomass. A study by the IEA suggests that only between
4.1 % and 14.8 % of transport fuel demand can be covered by second
generation biofuels in 2030 [14].

E-fuels are produced using electrolysis to break down water into
oxygen and hydrogen. If renewable power is used, the resulting hy-
drogen is also considered as a renewable fuel. Problems arise in direct
usage of hydrogen for road transport in either ICEVs or fuel cell electric
vehicles (FCEVs): due to its very low boiling point and small volumetric
energy content, it is difficult to transport and store. Thus, high-pressure
or cryogenic systems are required, incurring significant losses. Addi-
tionally, hydrogen has extremely wide flammability limits and is hence
more challenging in terms of safety. However, by activating CO2, more
easily handled renewable hydrocarbon fuels such as methane can be
synthesized. If longer-chained, liquid fuels are produced, and then the
advantages of liquid fuels in terms of transportation, storage, and order
of energy density are retained. Additionally, they can, unlike hydrogen,
be distributed using the existing fuel infrastructure and, in the best
case, unlike methane, be utilized in already existing, mature ICEVs
with no or small modifications. This would allow to also reduce CO2
emissions of the existing vehicle fleet, while it would take significant
time for BEVs to make up a large fraction of the vehicle fleet and
achieve a corresponding CO2-emission reduction even if they made
up the majority of sales in the near future, considering the average
life time of a passenger vehicle of around 16 years [15]. With wrong
political incentives, a premature exchange of the current vehicle fleet
towards BEV could lead to even larger total CO2 emissions compared
to a baseline scenario. Emissions arising from vehicle production and
shifting of emissions from the transport sector to the power genera-
tion sector [16] need to be considered, thus making renewable liquid
fuels for the existing fleet and ICEVs sold in the upcoming years an
important aspect for reaching the transport sector emission targets.
A combination of BEVs with liquid renewable fuel is likely also the
most beneficial solution of heavy-duty transport [17]. Additionally,
the synthesis of the liquid fuel from basic components enables tailor-
made fuels with advantageous properties compared to fossil fuels.
Fuels containing significant amounts of oxygen, for example, lead to
a significant reduction of engine-out particulate emissions [18], and
can thereby also contribute to cleaner air in urban areas and cheaper
aftertreatment systems.

1.2. Oxymethylene ethers

The range of possible e-fuel or biofuel molecules for internal com-
bustion engines is nearly endless, and the selection of promising candi-
dates is a significant challenge in itself [19]. On a high level, alcohols,
esters and ethers appear as the three major categories for internal
combustion engines. Methanol and ethanol as alcohols are already
widely used as gasoline substitute, e.g. ethanol in E10 fuel. The most
common esters are Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs), which exhibit a
high cetane number, making them suitable for CI engines. FAMEs are
also referred to as biodiesel. The currently least established fuel group
are the ethers, of which the most commonly considered molecules are
characterized by a very high oxygen content compared to FAMEs. One
particular fuel group among the ethers which has received increasing
attention in recent years is that of oxymethylene ethers (OMEx) with
)
x OCH3 and a chain length of 1 ≤
the molecular structure CH3
x ≤ 5.

(
OCH2

This group of fuels, as shown in Fig. 1, is also known under
the names polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (POMDME or PODE)
and oxymethylene dimethyl ethers (OMDME). In particular, OME1
is also known under various chemical names, mainly methylal and
dimethoxymethane (DMM), with DMMn sometimes also being used
for longer chain lengths. OMEx are liquid fuels that can be blended
with fossil diesel fuels and used in existing diesel engines with small

modifications. OME0 corresponds to dimethyl ether (DME), which is
a gaseous fuel, while longer chain lengths (x > 5) are solid under
standard conditions. OME1 is also used as a chemical solvent as well
as in the perfume and plastics industries [20]. OMEx share a repetition
of the unit CH2O with the engineering thermoplastic polyoxymethylene
(POM), which is widely used as injection molding material.

Oxygenated fuels have been investigated for their soot reduction
potential in CI engines already the in 1990s and early 2000s [21–
23]. Oxymethylene ethers show very promising soot suppression, even
among other oxygenates [24]. For OMEx with x ≥ 2, the cetane number
is larger than that of conventional diesel fuel, leading to improved
combustion behavior [25]. OMEx can theoretically be blended with
conventional diesel fuel and achieve highly super-linear soot reduction
in such fuel blends [26]. This blending option enables a continuous
transition towards a full replacement of fossil fuels until the point when
sufficient renewable electricity is available. However, some fuel prop-
erties which differ significantly between different chain lengths and
compared to conventional diesel fuel [25] lead to challenges regarding
engine design and operation. Additionally, material compatibility with
sealings and fuel lines is a challenge [27].

Overall, OMEx can be considered as being compatible with current
CI engine technology, similar to, e.g., biodiesel or Fischer–Tropsch
diesel. Compared to other possible renewable fuels such as methanol or
hydrogen, which lack the high Cetane numbers necessary for CI-engines
and hence require significant engine modifications, such as dual-fuel
operation, the required changes for OMEx application appear relatively
minor.

OMEx, more specifically OME1, was first mentioned by Romano
et al. [28] in 1986 as engine fuel in the context of gasoil extension
to satisfy increased gasoil demand in the patent application covering a
large group of dioxygenated methane derivates. Molton and Naegli [29]
were the first to describe OMEx with a chain length of 1 < x < 10 as
component of a diesel fuel blend with reduced smoke formation, and
gave several synthesis pathways in 1998. In the following years, BP
from 1999 to 2001 and later BASF from 2006 to 2008 investigated and
patented various OMEx synthesis routes from different feeds. Fleisch
and Sills [30] described the advantages of an OME3−8 blend as diesel
additive in terms of soot and NOx reduction. However, this work was
still in the context of a fossil gas-to-liquid production motivated by
an increase in global methanol availability. Finally, with increased
focus on coal-to-liquid, interest rose in China with various production
patents, research papers and pilot plants from 2010 onwards [31]. In
the last decade, Germany was a second driver of OMEx research, now
based on renewable P2X production. There, the two research projects
Kopernikus Power-to-X [32] and Namosyn [33] funded significant
OMEx production and utilization research on a larger scale.

1.3. Objective and structure of this paper

This work aims to critically review research conducted on OMEx
with 1 ≤ x ≤ 5. This excludes DME, as it is already extensively covered
in literature on its own [34,35], as well as oxymethylene ethers with
other chain terminating groups. For the latter, Bartholet et al. [36] and
Lucas et al. [37] highlight the impact of the different end groups on
combustion and material compatibility. Substantial work on different
end groups for oxymethylene ethers was done in the U.S. Department
of Energy funded Co-Optima research program, tackling, for example,
the water solubility and heating value issues of OMEx [38,39].

We will critically assess the potential of OMEx as diesel replacement
fuel, also considering different aspects related to production and usage
as a fuel. Concluding each major section, we also provide possible
research directions. First, in Section 2, several production pathways
for OMEx are given. This section concludes with results of life cycle
assessments. Research regarding chemical reaction kinetics of OMEx
is presented in Section 3. In particular, important reaction channels
during auto-ignition are discussed. On the fuel side, differences in

fuel properties such as viscosity, surface tension, energy content, and
cetane number compared to conventional Diesel fuel are found for
different OMEx chain lengths. In Section 4, these properties and the
consequential opportunities and challenges, including, e.g., material
compatibility and lubrication, are discussed. The resulting spray be-
havior under engine conditions is analyzed based on spray chamber
measurements. Spray and ignition behavior are then combined in Sec-
tion 5, where a large amount of experimental engine measurements and
simulation data for both neat OMEx and various blends is gathered
and analyzed regarding impact on engine efficiency, engine design,
as well as, among others, particulate and NOx emissions. A special
focus lies on the non-linear blend behavior. The paper finishes with
a discussion of production efficiency, cost and life cycle assessments,
as well as a concluding outlook on the short- and long-term potential
of the large-scale application of OMEx in Section 6.

2. Fuel production

In the competition between various bio- and e-fuels as well as
other alternatives such as BEV, the production efficiencies as well
as the associated production costs are probably deciding factors. For
OMEx, various production pathways based on different reactants exist,
resulting in a wide spread of predicted production efficiencies and
costs. To enable a better understanding, the first part of this chapter is
thus dedicated to a brief, high-level overview of the various production
pathways with their corresponding process engineering advantages and
disadvantages. First, the chemical processes necessary to produce the
base chemicals for further OMEx synthesis are outlined in Section 2.1,
focusing on production from renewable H2 and CO2. Second, in Sec-
tions 2.2 and 2.3, the production of OME1, and based on that also
of OMEx≥2 is discussed. Where available, technology readiness level
(TRL) assessments from literature, ranking from 1 to 9 using the TRL
definitions of the European Union for the Horizon 2020 program [40],
are also given. All pathways discussed here are summarized in Fig. 2.
It was shown by Peters et al. [41] that production of OMEx≥2
directly from H2 and CO2 without intermediates is thermodynamically
nearly impossible. For OME1, such synthesis is possible at high pres-
sures and low temperatures, but catalysts are necessary to suppress
the strongly favored production of DME. Thus, so far, all production
routes discussed in literature are based on methanol as base reactant,
even though formation of methanol from H2 and CO2 already involves
oxidizing part of the hydrogen, as discussed in Section 2.1, resulting in
an overall reduction of production efficiency compared to an idealized
one-step process.

As OME1 sees widespread use as chemical solvent, some production
pathways for OME1 are well-documented and on a very high TRL.
Production of longer-chain liquid OMEx, on the other hand, has only
recently started to gather research attention and only some pilot plants
exist outside of China, where OMEx production was pushed towards
an industrial scale. An overview of known Chinese plants with the
corresponding base reactants used and the plant capacities can be found
in a review by Hackbarth et al. [42].

2.1. Base chemical production

All practical OMEx synthesis pathways are based on methanol
(CH3OH) as base reactant. Methanol is a versatile precursor for various
chemical products and one of the most-produced chemicals world-wide
with around 100 million tons in 2017 [43], resulting in a TRL of this
sub-process of 9 [4]. It has also gathered attention as fuel for spark
ignition engines [44]. Methanol production is usually based on syngas
mainly consisting of H2, CO, and CO2 following

CO + 2H2 ↔ CH3OH,
CO2 + 3H2 ↔ CH3OH + H2O.

Conventionally, the syngas is produced from methane steam re-
forming or coal gasification [45]. However, production from hydrogen
produced by electrolysis of water and CO2 from direct air capture
according to Eq. (2) is also possible, enabling renewable production of
methanol [45]. In the context of methanol as reactant for OMEx produc-
tion, especially the latter methanol production pathway - making OMEx
an e-fuel - has garnered research attention in recent years, e.g., in the
German research initiative Kopernikus Power-to-X [32]. On the other
hand, the focus of Chinese OMEx research was mainly based on their
coal gasification-based methanol industry [46]. Finally, production of
syngas is also possible from biomass [47,48], so that production of
OMEx from biomass follows the same subsequent production steps.

The synthesis of OMEx can follow different routes based on different
intermediates produced from methanol. In general, an oxymethylene
monomer source and a methyl end group capping source need to be
provided. Capping sources can be methanol, DME, or OME1 (for higher
OMEx), while the monomer source is usually formaldehyde (CH2O),
which is highly unstable in monomeric form and is mostly provided
either in an aqueous solution (formalin), as trioxane (TRI, C3H6O3). or

Formaldehyde and subsequently trioxane and paraformaldehyde
can be produced from methanol via oxy-dehydrogenation of methanol
to formaldehyde on a silver catalyst (BASF process) or via the Formox
process, both with a TRL of 9 and according to the global reaction

CH3OH + 0.5O2 → CH2O + H2O

followed by synthesis of trioxane according to

3CH2O ↔ TRI,

with a TRL of 5 [4], or to paraformaldehyde

CH2O + H2O ↔ PFA1,
CH2O + PFAn ↔ PFAn+1

with a TRL of 5 as well [4].

DME can be produced via methanol dehydration according to

2CH3OH ↔ CH3OCH3 + H2O,

2.2. OME1 production

OME1 is both a potential product as well as a possible reactant for
further OMEx synthesis. Four promising pathways for OME1 produc-
tion are presented here in detail with their respective advantages and
challenges.

2.2.1. OME1 and OMEx production via established/aqueous route

The established production route corresponds to the route currently
already used on the large scale for commercial OME1 production. It
is based on methanol and formaldehyde (likely also produced from
methanol as discussed above) as base reactants, and takes place in an
aqueous solution using an acidic catalyst. The same reaction system
can also be used to produce longer-chain OMEx with the formaldehyde
concentration in the reactant feed mainly driving the tendency to
longer chain lengths. Therefore, OMEx≥2 synthesis via this pathway is
also included here. The TRL of this pathway is assessed to be relatively
high with 5 to 9 for OME1 [4,5], and 3–4 for OME3−5 [4,5].

In this pathway, methanol is used as capping source and formalde-
hyde is provided in an aqueous solution (formalin) as monomer source.
The aqueous solution contains only very low amounts of monomeric
formaldehyde. Formaldehyde quickly reacts with water, forming methy-

The reaction equilibria for these formation reactions are far on the
product side [51]. OMEx is formed from HFx and methanol by the
acetalization reaction

HFx + CH3OH ↔ OMEx + H2O

(12)

on an acidic catalyst [52]. Sequential growth of OMEx can then also
occur by insertion of monomeric formaldehyde [53] following

OMEx + CH2O ↔ OMEx+1.

with a TRL of 9 [4]. Advanced pathways with a direct DME synthesis
from syngas and thus improved efficiency are also available [50].

In the absence of OME1, OMEx≥2 are formed mainly via reactions
of hemiformals with methanol, not via sequential growth based on

H. Pitsch et al.

monomeric formaldehyde. In the presence of OME1, both pathways
become relevant [53].

Additional side products are trioxane and methyl formate formed
from monomeric formaldehyde [54]. This results in a reaction system
of competing reactions with the product composition depending on
reaction conditions, reactant feed composition, and catalysts. For a
low concentration of formaldehyde, there is no observable formation
of longer-chained OMEx, and only OME1 is found in the product feed
[52]. An increased ratio of formaldehyde to methanol increases the
yield of longer chain OMEx compared to OME1, while a higher water
content reduces the overall OMEx yield because water is a product of
the OMEx synthesis from HFx, Eq. (12).

Instead of aqueous formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde can be utilized
as monomer source. In this case, the first step is the dissociation of PFA
as

which is identical to the established route. The oxidative route does not
improve the hydrogen utilization. Its advantages and disadvantages in
comparison lie in different process engineering alone.

2.2.3. OME1 production via reductive route

To improve the utilization of hydrogen, a pathway that avoids the
partial oxidation of methanol to form formaldehyde has been formu-
lated by Thenert et al. [58]. This pathway is of particular interest when
considering OMEx as an e-fuel due to the resulting improved exergetic
efficiency of production and the fact that CO2 and H2 feedstocks are
already available, if the methanol synthesis from hydrogen and CO2 is
located in the same plant. CO2 is catalytically reduced with H2 in the
presence of methanol. Via the two intermediates methylformate and
then methoxymethanol, OME1 is formed. The resulting overall reaction
is described by

PFAn ↔ PFAn−1 + CH2O.

(14)

2CH3OH + CO2 + 2H2 ↔ OME1 + 2H2O.

(19)

Finally, trioxane can be utilized as monomer source instead of
formaldehyde. Here, trioxane is dissociated via an acidic catalyst into
formaldehyde by the reversal of the reaction in Eq. (4) first. Due to
using methanol as capping group source, water is produced in this
synthesis and the remaining process is similar to the aqueous route
described above. Trioxane is, however, an expensive reactant compared
to aqueous formaldehyde.

The practical challenge for this production route lies in the sepa-
ration of the desired OMEx from water, side products, and reactants
routed back into the feed. This is achieved by a reactive distillation
in multiple columns. The yields are lower compared to other reaction
pathways [55]. Burre et al. [56] estimate the achievable carbon yield,
defined by the carbon mass in the desired product compared to the
carbon mass in the initial reactants, to 90 %. On the other hand, the
costly synthesis of intermediates such as trioxane and also OME1 for
products OMEx≥2 can be avoided [54].

For production of OME1 from H2 and CO2, the overall reaction

balance assuming no side product formation is given by

Schieweck et al. [59] were able to achieve the same reaction pathway
using a cobalt-based catalyst instead of the ruthenium-based catalyst
proposed by Thenert et al. [58], eliminating the need for rare earth
catalyst materials.

The overall carbon yield of the reductive process is estimated to be
very high with about 97 % [56]. However, the most relevant downside
is the large heat demand for product separation due to low methanol
conversion rates in the reactor, significantly impacting the efficiency.
Moreover, with H2 and CO2, two additional reactants are required also
in the OME1 production step.

For production of OME1 from H2 and CO2, the overall reaction

balance assuming no side product formation is given by

8H2 + 3CO2 ↔ OME1 + 4H2O,

(20)

showing the advantage of the reductive route compared to the two
routes previously discussed.

9H2 + 3CO2 + 0.5O2 ↔ OME1 + 5H2O,

(15)

2.2.4. OMEx production via methanol-dehydrogenation route

Another alternative pathway, which improves the overall hydrogen

i.e., five molecules of hydrogen are oxidized to water during the pro-
duction process. Considering that H2 consumption is likely the driver
of the overall production costs as well as exergetic efficiency, most
development on more advanced routes tries to partially avoid these
oxidative reaction pathways.

2.2.2. OME1 production via oxidative route

In this pathway, the first step of formaldehyde synthesis from
methanol on a silver catalyst in a different reactor is skipped. In-
stead, methanol can be partially oxidized to formaldehyde according to
Eq. (16), which then directly reacts with methanol to OME1 according
to

CH3OH + 0.5 O2 ↔ CH2O + H2O,
2CH3OH + CH2O ↔ OME1 + H2O,

(16)

(17)

requiring a catalyst with both redox sites and acidic sites of appropriate
strength. A review of this method with an extensive overview of differ-
ent suitable catalysts can be found in Thavornprasert et al. [57]. As in
the established route, water is found in the product stream. However,
as formaldehyde instantly reacts to the desired product, it is not bound
to water, which thus can be separated more easily as it contains less
side products. As less side products are formed, yields are also higher.
Carbon yields are estimated to about 94 % [56]. Less heating of the
reactor itself is required compared to the established route, but the
product removal from the highly diluted gaseous product stream is
energy intensive [56].

balance, is based on methanol dehydrogenation,

CH3OH ↔ CH2O + H2.

(21)

Here, hydrogen is not directly oxidized to water, can be separated from
the product stream and routed back into the methanol synthesis. The
challenge in this step lies in the instability of molecular formaldehyde,
which quickly reacts to various undesired side products and interme-
diates. Two different ways to avoid this have been discussed in the
literature.

The first was described by Ouda et al. [55,60,61]. It utilizes en-
dothermic dehydrogenation of methanol at high temperatures (above
650 °C) on a selective catalyst to produce formaldehyde and hydrogen
followed by rapidly cooling down the mixture to avoid formation of
side products and then by separation of hydrogen. The second step,
the formation of OME1 or OMEx≥2, is the same as in the established
route including all side product reactions. Advantages of this method
are the improved H2 balance as well as higher product yields in the
OMEx reactor, as no water is contained in the reactant feed and thus the
overall water concentration is lower. The TRL of the dehydrogenation
process is assessed to be 3 [5].

The second way was published by Sun et al. [62]. Here, similar
to the oxidative route, a one-pot process on a single catalyst is used.
On different sites, first methanol is dehydrogenated to formaldehyde
following Eq. (21), which then on a different site immediately reacts
with more methanol to OME1 according to

For production of OME1 from H2 and CO2, the overall reaction

2CH3OH + CH2O ↔ OME1 + H2O.

(22)

balance assuming no side product formation is given by

9H2 + 3CO2 + 0.5O2 ↔ OME1 + 5H2O,

(18)

This process heavily relies on high catalyst selectivity to avoid the
formation of side products, which include methyl-formates and DME.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)1011736

H. Pitsch et al.

With the currently available catalyst, the carbon yield is relatively low
at about 77 % [56]. Additionally, the conversion rate of methanol is
low, leading to large separation energy demand. On the other hand, the
side products are valuable, and again the hydrogen extracted during the
methanol dehydrogenation can be routed back to methanol production,
improving the overall hydrogen utilization.

Consequently, for both alternatives, the overall reaction balance for
production of OME1 from H2 and CO2, including the side product H2
from the methanol dehydrogenation given in Eq. (21) and assuming no
other side product formation, is given by

9H2 + 3CO2 ↔ OME1 + 4H2O + H2.

(23)

For OMEx≥2 production based on the Ouda process, the advanta-
geous non-oxidative formaldehyde provision without water side prod-
uct formation also leads to significant improvements on overall hydro-
gen utilization compared to all other pathways.

2.3. OMEx≥2 production

The most common production process for OMEx≥2 is the aque-
ous, established route already discussed in detail in the previous Sec-
tion 2.2.1. However, also anhydrous production is possible, as de-
scribed in the following subsections. Typical for all production path-
ways is that the end product is not a single chain length, but a mixture
of chain lengths depending on the process parameters. A common
composition for diesel fuel substitution called OME3−5 typically consists
of ∼40–50 % OME3, ∼25–40 % OME4, ∼10–25 % OME5 and ∼0–15 % other
OMEx [3,5,63,64]. The exact composition of such a fuel mixture has
impact on its fuel properties, discussed in Section 4, and consequently
also on its combustion as discussed in Section 5.

2.3.1. OMEx≥2 production via anhydrous route from trioxane and OME1
When OME1 is produced in a first step and then used as end group
provider, chain growth via insertion of formaldehyde from trioxane is
a way to synthesize higher OMEx. The TRL of this pathway is assessed
to be about 5 [4]. The main reactions are given by

TRI ↔ 3CH2O,
OME1 + CH2O ↔ OME2,
OMEx + CH2O ↔ OMEx+1.

(24)

(25)

(26)

Trioxane dissociates into monomeric formaldehyde, e.g. on an HSO4
catalyst, which then in turn is inserted into existing OMEx leading to
sequential chain growth1. As all reactions are equilibrium reactions, a
mixture of reactants and OME2−10 constitute the reactor products [65,
66]. As water is not part of the reactant stream and not formed during
the process, this constitutes an anhydrous route. Burger et al. [65]
investigated the process in more detail and gave a technical production
process capable of producing 1 million tonnes per year in a single train
plant.

A slightly different variant of this reaction pathway is the utilization
of paraformaldehyde as formaldehyde source. Only reaction Eq. (24) is
replaced by the dissociation of PFA, Eq. (27).

PFAn ↔ PFAn−1 + CH2O

(27)

The product yields for the anhydrous route are very high [46] and
the product work-up through distillation much easier compared to the
aqueous route, as no water is contained in the product feed. On the
other hand, the reactants OME1 and trioxane are significantly more
expensive. No additional oxidation reactions appear in the synthesis

1 An alternative mechanism, in which trioxane does not fully dissociate into
formaldehyde, but just breaks open and is inserted into OMEx is unlikely,
as this would lead to a selective favorisation of OME4,7,10,..., which was not
experimentally observed [65].

steps described here, so that the overall hydrogen conversion rate de-
pends entirely on the processes utilized to produce the reactants OME1
and trioxane, as discussed above. A combination of either the reductive
pathway or the dehydrogenation pathway with the anhydrous OMEx≥2
process results in slightly less hydrogen consumption overall compared
to the aqueous route, but as those savings can be attributed to the
OME1 end group production, the relative effect on total hydrogen
consumption is lower for OMEx≥2 than for OME1.

2.3.2. OMEx≥2 production via anhydrous route from trioxane and DME

Using DME instead of OME1 as a capping source and the same
zeolite catalyst, trioxane is directly incorporated into DME forming
OME3

2, resulting in the overall reaction

DME + TRI ↔ OME3.

(28)

Subsequently, transacetalization reactions lead to a mixture of different
chain lengths,

OMEn + OMEm ↔ OMEn+1 + OMEm−1.

(29)

The advantage of this production path is the usage of cheaper DME
instead of OME1 compared to the other anhydrous reaction pathway.
However, it still relies on the costly trioxane. Major disadvantages are
the necessary very long residence times and significant formation of
methylformate as side product, which cannot be easily recycled [68].
The TRL of this pathway is assessed to be about 4 [4].

2.4. Future research perspectives

The development of alternative, advantageous production pathways
has received a lot of research attention in the recent years, as evident
in the number of publications discussed above. The results from the
production cost and efficiency as well as life cycle assessments, which
are all closely related to each other and presented in Sections 6.1 to 6.3,
show how significant the advantages of these production pathways
can become in comparison to the established pathway when it comes
to competitiveness with other e-fuels. However, most studies of the
corresponding reaction systems were entirely theoretical or limited
to lab-scale experiments, and the corresponding technology readiness
levels are thus still low, as also pointed out by many authors. If a fa-
vorable political framework is created, collaboration between academia
and industry will be necessary to move towards small and mid-scale
production plants to gather valuable practical information about the
underlying processes. At the same time, recent research achievements
have shown that there is still room for improvement regarding, e.g., cat-
alyst choice, so continued fundamental research in that area is still
desirable.

3. Combustion reaction kinetics

Combustion characteristics of OMEx depend on the details of chem-
ical kinetics. For instance, the auto-ignition characteristics of OMEx are
of particular importance for their CI engine applications. In Fig. 3, it is
interesting to observe a non-linear behavior of ignition delay times of
OMEx when going from small to large molecules. This is also reflected
in their cetane numbers. Detailed knowledge about these auto-ignition
characteristics and other combustion behaviors of OMEs are thus pre-
requisite to understand their engine performance and to assess their
application potential as diesel substitutes. Therefore, the fundamental
combustion behaviors of OMEx are evaluated and their underlying
chemical kinetics are explored here, which is greatly facilitated by
a series of recently published studies on OME1 [69–75] and larger
OMEs [70,76,77].

2 This was also confirmed by species measurements, which showed a

substantial peak of OME3 in the product stream [67].

Cai et al. [77], respectively.

3.1. Kinetic modeling

3.1.1. OME1

With the significantly increased interest in the application of OMEx,
OME1 as the smallest OMEx fuel, has received extensive research
attention. Based on the analogies drawn to structurally similar fuels,
a number of studies have developed chemical mechanisms for OME1.
Daly et al. [79] developed the first mechanism in 2001. It includes
the detailed reaction channels of fuel decomposition, H-abstraction of
the fuel, and fuel radical decomposition as well as global reactions for
the sequences of R + O2 → RO2 → QOOH → decomposition products.
The rate coefficients of these reactions were estimated according to
analogous reactions of DME, DEE, and small normal alkanes. Based on
this mechanism, Dias et al. [80] and Marrodán et al. [81,82] proposed
updated reaction mechanisms of OME1, which also only include the
simplified low-temperature oxidation pathways from Daly et al. [79].
A number of studies became available recently, reporting theoret-
ically and experimentally determined rate constants for elementary
reactions taking place in the oxidation of OME1. Vermeire et al. [69] ex-
plored the fate of the peroxy (RO2) and peroxy hydroperoxide (O2QOOH)
radicals of OME1 by calculating their potential energy surfaces (PESs)
and consequently estimated the thermochemical properties of species
and rate constants of reactions present on the PESs. In the same year,
He et al. [70] used quantum chemistry methods as well to calculate the
rate constants of the H-atom abstraction reactions of OME1 by OH, the
β-scission reactions of OME1 radicals (R), the isomerization reactions
of peroxy radicals, and the decomposition reactions of hydroperoxide
radicals (QOOH) in the oxidation of OME1. The rate coefficients of
the β-scission reactions of secondary hydroperoxide radicals were re-
calculated later by Jacobs et al. [71] at high level of theory, motivated
by their high impacts on the prediction of ignition delay times at low
and intermediate temperatures. The rate constants of H-abstraction
reactions of OME1 by H and CH3 were determined by Kopp et al. [83]
based on ab initio calculations at the same level, in conjunction with
those of the β-scission and isomerization reactions of OME1 radicals.
Fig. 4 shows the comparison of high-pressure limiting rate constants
of β-scission reactions of OME1 radicals [83] with those of OME0
radicals calculated by Burke et al. [78]. It is apparent from Fig. 4 that
the rate constants of secondary OME1 radicals are much larger than
others over the entire temperature range, indicating a rapid β-scission
of secondary OME1 radicals even at low and intermediate temperatures.
This favored β-scission reaction is attributed to the significantly lower
dissociation energy of the corresponding C-O bond, as discussed by

Jacobs et al. [71], and has a strong impact on the ignition propensity of
OME1, which will be discussed later in more detail. The unimolecular
decomposition reactions of OME1 were studied theoretically [72,74,
84] and experimentally [72–74,85]. Moreover, Golka et al. [73] car-
ried out shock tube experiments to measure the rate constants of the
H-abstraction reaction by H radical.

These investigations on elementary reactions have greatly promoted
the development of the chemical mechanisms for the oxidation of
OME1 in recent years. Vermeire et al. [69], He et al. [70], Jacobs
et al. [71], Shrestha et al. [86], and Li et al. [75] have constructed
detailed chemical mechanisms of OME1, respectively, by applying the
concept of reaction classes and rate rules [87–89]. Recently reported
rate constants were incorporated in these mechanisms, which were
validated against different sets of experimental measurements covering
a range of conditions.

3.1.2. Larger OMEx

While extensive research efforts have been dedicated to the reac-
tion kinetics of OME1, studies on larger OMEx are still scarce in the
literature.

Sun et al. [76] measured the laminar burning velocities of OME3
in a combustion vessel and the species profiles in a low-pressure
premixed flame with synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization
mass spectrometry. These datasets provide an initial insight into the
high-temperature reaction kinetics of large OMEx and, in addition,
serve as validation targets for a proposed chemical mechanism [76].
This mechanism was developed by incorporating only high-temperature
reactions. The rate coefficients of analogous reactions of DME and
DEE were employed as consistent rate rules for these three fuels, as
theoretical calculations of C-H and C-O bond dissociation energies
confirmed the similarity between the same bond types of OME1−3 [76].
In both experimental and numerical investigations, it was found that
the formation of C2 species is strongly inhibited, while the emissions
of formaldehyde is increased, owing to the replacement of C–C by C-O
bonds in the molecule structure.

A comprehensive kinetic mechanism for the oxidation of OME1−3
was derived afterwards by He et al. [70], which includes both low- and
high-temperature chemistry. This model was also constructed based
on the concept of reaction classes and rate rules [87–89] and its rate
rules were adopted from the theoretically calculated rate constants for
analogous reactions of OME1 or structurally similar smaller molecules.
The mechanism has been validated against the ignition delay times of
diluted OME3/air mixtures measured in an RCM for the temperature
range of 640–865 K as well as cylinder pressure and rate of heat release

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)1011738

H. Pitsch et al.

profiles of HCCI engine experiments [70]. Nevertheless, it is worth
mentioning that non-reactive volume profiles were not reported for
these RCM experiments. This can lead to large uncertainties in model
prediction, when using results of constant-volume reactor simulations
for comparison with these RCM experiments [78]. While the mech-
anisms of Sun et al. [76] and He et al. [70] were derived with a
hierarchical structure by including the relevant reaction schemes of
OME1 and OME2 as well, these respective submechanisms were not
validated, partly due to the missing experimental data at that time.
Lately, Drost et al. [90] measured ignition delay times of stoichiometric
OME2/air and OME3/air mixtures in an RCM at pressures of 3-10 bar
and temperatures of 570–690 K.

A new detailed chemical mechanism of OME2−4 was developed by
Cai et al. [77] based on the OME1 mechanism of Jacobs et al. [71]
taking advantage of the improved kinetic knowledge on OME1. The
fuel-specific mechanism was derived by using an automatic reaction-
class-based mechanism generator, which adopted the reaction classes
and rate rules from the OME1 mechanism of Jacobs et al. [71] and
then applied them consistently for larger OMEx. This approach ensures
the chemical consistency of the proposed reaction mechanism. In order
to minimize its prediction uncertainty, the model was subjected sub-
sequently to an automatic model optimization process by calibrating
some rate rules within their uncertainty limits [91,92] against the
ignition delay times of OME2−4 reported also by that study [77]. Fig. 5
compares the ignition delay times of OME3 calculated by using the
detailed mechanisms from Cai et al. [77] and He et al. [70]. While
the differences between models are minor in the high-temperature
range, the model of Cai et al. [77] predicts the ignition delay times
at low and intermediate temperatures with improved accuracy. A high-
temperature chemical mechanism was proposed by Kathrotia et al. [93]
for the oxidation of OME1−5. The model was validated successfully
against the ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds of OME1 as
well as the species profiles of laminar flames of OME1 and OME3.

A chemical mechanism of OME2 was also developed by De Ras
et al. [94], who also investigated the pyrolysis and oxidation chemistry
of OME2 in a quartz reactor and in a rapid compression machine,
respectively. The chemical mechanism was generated by using the auto-
matic kinetic model generator Genesys [95] based on reaction families
extracted from the OME1 mechanism [69]. The model incorporates
theoretically calculated parameters for species and reactions, mostly
available on PESs of peroxy radicals. Nevertheless, it is notable that,
for the sake of the reduction of computational costs, this mechanism
excludes O2 addition reactions to hydroperoxide radicals and their
subsequent reaction pathways. This may lead to large model prediction
uncertainties for the ignition delay times at lean conditions as shown
in Fig. 6 and mentioned by De Ras et al. [94]. It is also found that this
model [94] gives more satisfactory results at high temperatures than
the model of Cai et al. [77].

Very recently, Shrestha et al. [96] proposed a new chemical mecha-
nism for the oxidation of OME1−3 based on the model of He et al. [70].
The rate parameters of a number of important reactions, such as H-
abstraction of fuel by HO2, CH2, and CH3O, were updated by taking
values from literature studies [77]. The information of all mechanisms
mentioned above is summarized in Table 1. An overview of validation
experiments can be found in Fenard and Vanhove [97] and Shrestha
et al. [96]. Performance comparisons between various models can
be found in Fig. 6 and in literature works [94,96]. Note that the
mechanism of Cai et al. [77] was applied in the present work for
further kinetic analysis, as it is the only one including consistent and
comprehensive reaction chemistry of OME0−4.

3.1.3. Reduced chemical models

In addition to the detailed chemical models for the oxidation of
larger OMEx, several studies focused on the development of reduced
chemical mechanisms,
including those from He et al. [100], Ren
et al. [101], Huang et al. [102], Lin et al. [103], Jing et al. [104],

Fig. 5. Ignition delay times of OME3. Symbols denote data from Cai et al. [77]. Solid
and dashed lines show the computed results with the mechanisms from Cai et al. [77]
and He et al. [70], respectively.

Niu et al. [105], and Bai et al. [106]. These reduced mechanisms
were generated based on the detailed mechanisms mentioned above by
using various reduction techniques, such as direct relation graph with
error propagation (DRGEP) [107], isomer lumping [107], sensitivity
analysis [108], and decoupling method [105]. Some of them were ad-
ditionally optimized automatically for good model performance [105,
106]. Due to their compact sizes, these mechanisms of larger OMEx can
reduce the computational cost in CFD simulations.

3.2. Auto-ignition characteristics

Ignition delay times of neat OME1 were determined experimentally
in a rapid compression machine (RCM) [71], a flow reactor [71], and
shock tubes [71,109]. A comprehensive dataset of ignition delay times
of OME2−4 measured in a shock tube at engine-relevant conditions
was reported in the recent past by Cai et al. [77] at pressures of
10 and 20 bar for equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 covering
the temperature range of 663–1112 K. That work facilitates a direct
comparison of the ignition delay times of OME2−4 over a wide range
of initial temperatures and also allows for their comparison with the
data of OME1 [71] at identical conditions, as demonstrated in Fig. 3.
It is seen that the ignition delay times of larger OMEx are smaller than
those of OME1, while the temperature dependence follows a similar
trend for all OMEx.

By using the optimized model of Cai et al. [77], the reaction
pathways of OME1−4 were explored and compared consistently, which

provided deeper insights into the ignition kinetics of OMEx. While, as
shown in [97], the various recently developed models [69,71,86] still
provide different numerical results, for instance for ignition delay times
and species mole fraction profiles in JSR, the major reaction pathways
of OME1 predicted by the different models are similar. As shown in
Fig. 7, primary and secondary radicals are formed in the oxidation of
OME1 after the H-abstraction of fuel by small radicals, such as OH and
HO2. The consumption pathways of primary fuel radicals follow the
conventional reaction channels of alkane radicals, which decompose
via β-scission at high temperatures and are oxidized via oxygen addi-
tion at low temperatures. A notable difference is, however, observed in
the reactions of secondary radicals. As mentioned earlier, the β-scission
of secondary radicals is very favorable. Over the entire temperature
range, rather than being subject to oxygen addition and subsequent
low-temperature reactions at low and intermediate temperatures, as in
the case of secondary alkane radicals, the mechanism of the secondary

OME1 radical is governed by its decomposition, leading to methyl
radical and methyl formate. This reaction channel inhibits the chain-
branching pathway of the secondary radical almost completely. As a
consequence, the ignition propensity of OME1 at low and intermediate
temperatures is substantially reduced compared with OME0, which is
seen in Fig. 3 and, in addition, expressed in its small cetane number.
It is seen in Fig. 7 that, for larger OMEx, the β-scission reaction is
the dominant consumption path for the secondary fuel radicals with
the radical site β to the primary carbon over the entire temperature
range with more than 90%, while the primary and other secondary
fuel radicals are mainly oxidized by undergoing the conventional chain-
branching pathways at low and intermediate temperatures. This is
consistent with the findings for OME1. As mentioned earlier, this de-
composition reaction decelerates auto-ignition by inhibiting the chain
propagation in the low- and intermediate-temperature ranges. Owing
to the decreased branching ratio of β fuel radical production in the

et al. [77].

oxidation of OME2−4, which decreases from 29% for OME2 to 19%
for OME4, the ignition propensity of larger OMEx is promoted in
comparison with OME1.

In comparison to the reaction pathways of long-chain normal alka-
nes, such as n-heptane and n-dodecane, which are typical surrogate
components of conventional petroleum fuels, the polyoxymethylene
structure introduces two major features. First, the H-abstraction re-
activity is strongly promoted by the decreased C-H bond dissociation
energies. Second, the β-scission reactions of fuel radicals are facilitated
at low temperatures as well, which is not observed for alkanes. Both im-
pacts compensate each other in part leading to similar cetane numbers
between OMEx and their alkane counterparts with identical numbers
of heavy atoms.

3.3. Pyrolysis and combustion characteristics

A large number of datasets can be found in the literature for
the combustion and pyrolysis of OME1. Laminar flame speeds were
measured by Shrestha et al. [86] and Eckart et al. [110]. Specia-
tion experiments were conducted in various laboratory configurations,
including premixed flames [80,110,111], diffusion flames [112], jet
stirred reactors (JSRs) [79,113,114], and flow reactors [62,71,82].
Detailed information on these measurements was summarized in a re-
cently published mini-review by Fenard and Vanhove [97] and are thus
not repeated here. The latest studies include those by Li et al. [115],
Nativel et al. [116], and Ngugi et al. [117], who investigated the impact
of blending with OME1.

Eckart et al. [110] applied a heat flux burner to measure the
laminar burning velocities and exhaust gas compositions of OME1
and OME2 at atmospheric pressure and initial temperatures of 383–
401 K for equivalence ratios of 0.6–1.9. As demonstrated by vom Lehn
et al. [118], OMEx have faster laminar burning velocities than typical
petroleum-derived fuels, such as n-heptane and iso-octane. This can be
attributed to the large amount of reactive formaldehyde produced via
the β-scission of primary fuel radicals [76].

Efforts have been also dedicated to investigating the oxidation of
OME3 in a jet stirred reactor [119], in flow reactors [120], in low-
pressure flames [121], and in cool flames [122]. Qiu et al. [119]

obtained the concentration profiles of fuel, oxygen, products, and some
stable intermediate species of OME3 oxidation from JSR experiments at
atmospheric pressure. Reasonable agreements were observed between
the experimental data and the numerical results with the chemical
mechanisms from He et al. [70] and Cai et al. [77]. However, notable
differences were found in the reaction pathways predicted by the
two models in terms of the branching ratios of β-scission reactions
of fuel radicals. Very recently, a systematic study was carried out by
Gaiser et al. [120] to measure the speciation data of OME0−5 oxidation
in laminar flow reactors with mass spectrometry and photoelectron
photoion coincidence spectroscopy. It was found that methyl formate
is the oxygenate intermediate with the highest fraction formed in the
oxidation of OME1−5. Speciation measurements were performed by
Gaiser et al. [121] for premixed low-pressure flames of rich OME0−3/air
mixtures. The results demonstrated the enhanced reactivity for larger
OMEx. Soot precursors were not detected in experiments, which in-
dicates good application potential of OMEs in engines in terms of
soot reduction. Experiments were performed by De Ras et al. [122]
for stabilized, ozone-seeded OME2/DME/O2 premixed cool flames in a
heated stagnation plate burner at lean conditions. The quantified reac-
tion products were methoxymethyl formate, methyl formate, methanol,
formaldehyde, CO, and CO2.

Due to its importance, the pyrolysis chemistry of OMEx was inves-
tigated in the literature as well. Pyrolysis experiments of OME2 were
performed in a quartz reactor over a broad temperature range to gain
insights into the primary and secondary pyrolysis chemistry [94,98].
Major products and intermediate species were identified and it was
found that the elimination of formaldehyde is the dominant reaction
for the decomposition of OME2. In addition, both studies highlight
the importance of the radical chemistry in the pyrolysis of OME2 at
high temperatures, which is driven by the decomposition of carbenes.
The highly unstable methoxycarbene is formed via the unimolecular
decomposition of OME2 and decomposes quickly to form methyl and
formyl radicals. As reported in [98], while carbenes cannot be de-
tected during the experiments, the byproduct of the carbene formation,
methoxymethanol, was measured in significant concentrations. It was
also observed that, with the increased initial reactor temperatures,

more radicals are generated via the decomposition of carbenes, and
their chemistry becomes of increasing importance. Thus, the formation
of radicals via carbenes is identified as a characteristic feature in the
pyrolysis of OMEx [94,98]. The pyrolysis of OME1−3 was studied by
Zhong et al. [99] in a jet-stirred reactor with gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry methods. Again, formaldehyde was detected as major
intermediate species along with methyl formate. With the increased
chain length, the fuel reactivity increases significantly, which is evi-
denced by the decreased initial pyrolysis temperature. It was also found
that the fuel-specific chain initiation reactions are important in the
unimolecular decomposition of OME1−3 by providing the initial methyl
and hydrogen radicals. These reactions have a significant influence on
the production and consumption of methyl formate.

3.4. Unburnt hydrocarbon formation

The unburnt hydrocarbon formation of the oxidation of OMEx is
of high research interest. As illustrated previously, the β-scission of
secondary fuel radicals, which eliminates a methyl radical, is an im-
portant reaction channel in the oxidation of OMEx. Owing to this,
methane is supposed to be a major chemical component in combus-
tion emissions of OMEs, which is a very important issue for practical
applications as it is difficult to reduce methane in exhaust gas af-
tertreatment systems. To gain a first insight into this, a numerical
analysis was performed here to assess methane formation during the
oxidation of OMEs. The computation was carried out for the auto-
ignition of OME1−4 at a pressure of 20 bar and an initial temperature
of 825 K for three different equivalence ratios by using the optimized
model [77]. The peak mole fractions of methane formed during the
oxidation are shown in Fig. 8. For comparison, the computed results for
the auto-ignition of conventional petroleum fuel are depicted in Fig. 8
as well. The calculation was performed with a surrogate mixture of a
characterized research grade gasoline, RON95E10 [123] and n-heptane
as a single-component diesel surrogate fuel. The chemical mechanism
from [123] was used in the simulations. It is seen that the formation
of methane is promoted significantly in the oxidation of OME1−4 at the
investigated conditions. With the increase in chain length and the num-
ber of oxymethylene groups, the maximum concentration of methane
consequently decreases. Nevertheless, compared with gasoline, more
methane is emitted from the combustion of OMEx, which deserves
particular attention when applying OMEx as renewable substitutes. This
aspect will be discussed in Section 5.5.

3.5. Future research perspectives

The recently published research has greatly deepened our under-
standing on the reaction kinetics of OME1. The theoretical calculations
reported thermochemical properties for species and rate constants for
important elementary reactions. Datasets were obtained in various
experimental configurations covering a very wide range of initial con-
ditions. Detailed mechanisms were proposed to describe the oxidation
of OME1 and were validated successfully. Further insights were pro-
vided into the consumption pathways of OME1. Nevertheless, there
are still remaining limitations motivating further investigations. First,
the H-abstraction reaction of OME1 by the HO2 radical has not been
studied, which is, however, one of the most important reactions for the
OME1 oxidation at intermediate and high temperatures, as identified
by various studies [71,75,97]. Second, remarkable differences were
observed in the prediction results with different chemical reaction
mechanisms [97], which are mostly attributed to the differently as-
signed rate constants for sensitive reactions. While several theoretical
and experimental studies have reported rate constants for the same
reactions, differences can be observed between their respective values,
for instance for the H-abstraction reactions of fuel by the H radical [97],
which points to considerable remaining uncertainties. This motivates
a careful evaluation of these results, the calculation of rate constants
at higher levels of theory, or the automatic model optimization and
uncertainty quantification [91,92] to minimize model prediction un-
certainties. Third, additional research efforts should be dedicated to
understand the blending impact of OME1. The blending behaviors of
OME1 with components, such as n-heptane [124], NO [125], and diesel
surrogate [126], have been investigated in the past. However, as found
by Zhang et al. [125], the available mechanisms failed to predict the
measurements of OME1/NO mixtures, which implied that the chemical
interactions between OME1 and NO are not well understood [125].

In comparison to OME1, the knowledge on the combustion ki-
netics of higher OMEs is still very limited, despite the significantly
increased interests in their application. As the larger OMEs are fuel
candidates for compression-ignition engine application, the available
experimental works mostly focused on their auto-ignition behaviors.
Therefore, extensive efforts are required to gain more data with well-
quantified uncertainties from various fundamental configurations over
a wide range of conditions for the different OMEs to allow for a
thorough assessment of their fundamental combustion characteristics
and to provide a comprehensive database of experimental targets for
model development and validation.

The available chemical mechanisms for larger OMEs were devel-
oped with a hierarchical structure based on the model of OME1. The
rate constants of elementary reactions were specified by using rate rules
adopted from analogous reactions of OME1. While the rate constants
of some OME1 reactions were well-estimated and studies confirmed
the similarity between the corresponding C-H and C-O BDEs of OME1
and larger OMEs, this approach still inevitably introduces model un-
certainties. Moreover, rate parameters are often tuned for a particular
large OME fuel. Figs. 9 and 10 compare the rate constants of the H-
abstraction reactions of OME2 by OH and HO2 radicals used in different
chemical mechanisms, respectively. Particularly interesting here is the
fact that strong variations are observed in these rate parameters, even
though some of them were determined by modifying the same original
values [70,77,94] and important combustion targets are found to be
very sensitive towards them [94]. As a consequence, various models
yield significantly different results, for instance for ignition delay times,
as demonstrated in Figs. 5 and 6. Therefore, it is desirable, on the one
hand, to obtain accurate rate constants for the reactions of larger OMEs
from calculations and experiments directly and, on the other hand,
to explore the kinetic similarity between the analogous reactions of
OME1 and larger OMEs in depth. The advanced model optimization
and uncertainty quantification methods [91] can also be applied to cal-
ibrate rate parameters and to minimize model prediction uncertainties.

et al. [77], and He et al. [70], respectively.

Furthermore, theoretical investigations are expected to reveal potential
novel pathways initiated by the increased chain length, which are not
considered in the present mechanisms.

Finally, for practical applications in industry, development of heav-
ily reduced, yet still accurate kinetic reaction mechanisms both for neat
OMEx as well as blends with common diesel surrogates are desirable.
Fuel blends are the most likely first step in the transition phase to a fully
renewable fuel. This makes seamless transition to a fully renewable
drivetrain possible, which is a major advantages for e-fuels such as
OMEx compared with other technologies. Reduced mechanisms for neat
OMEx and relevant fuel blends can substantially support the necessary
parameter optimization of engine design and control based on CFD
methods.

4. Fuel properties and spray behavior

A renewable drop-in diesel fuel that meets the requirements of
existing standards would be desirable to assist the defossilization of in-
service diesel vehicles. However, depending on the chain-length, some
properties of pure OMEx are outside the scope of the EN590 diesel fuel
standard and present challenges for engine design and control. Some
of them impact spray behavior, mixture preparation, or combustion
and are important for efficiency and pollutant emissions. Others such

as melting points, material compatibility and toxicity are relevant for
operability, fuel handling and environment. If a drop-in fuel fulfilling
existing fuel standards (i.e., EN590 in Europe for diesel fuel) would
be desired for applications in future and existing vehicles, only a
very limited amount of the OMEx component could be blended into
diesel fuel. To increase the blending rate of OMEx into diesel fuel,
the EN590 specification would have to be modified or a new standard
developed, as the chemical properties of OMEx (higher cetane number
than diesel ≥65, higher density and maximum boiling temperature)
would violate the EN590 limits. For this reason, new standardization
activities have been initiated, e.g. the German DIN standard 51699 for
OME3−5 as a fuel for CI engines is currently under preparation [127].
In the meantime, a technical specification DIN/TS 51699 has been
published as a first step. Following the suggested specifications, the
largest differences to EN590 will be an increase of the minimum cetane
number to 70 as well as an increase of the maximum density and a
decrease of the maximum boiling temperature. This way, OME fuels
could be used even in the existing fleet, if vehicles would be adapted for
their use, for instance, in terms of engine control system and material
compatibility.

Here, we will first discuss the most interesting properties together
with their qualitative impact on engine utilization in Section 4.1. In
Section 4.2, the impact of some of these properties on liquid spray
behavior is investigated based on experimental measurements and
simulation data. For quantitative discussions about the impact of the
different fuel properties on real engine operation, the reader is referred
to the subsequent Section 5.

4.1. Liquid fuel properties

In the following, data for various fuel properties of OMEx are col-
lected, compared, and discussed. As reference, values for the range de-
fined by EN590 [128] for conventional diesel fuel, values for DME, and
typical values for HVO as renewable alternative, and for n-dodecane
and n-heptane as common single-component diesel surrogates are given.
Table 2 gives an overview of the fuel properties. Finally, the OMEx-
specific issue of sealing and fuel system degradation as well as the
miscibility with conventional diesel fuel are discussed.

4.1.1. Density

The liquid density of OMEx is generally higher than the range given
by EN590 for conventional fossil diesel fuel, and increases with the
chain length. This partly counteracts the lower heating value of OMEx
as discussed in Section 4.1.6. Injection rate measurements performed
for OME3−5 showed that for a given injection pressure, the fuel density
is governing the total injected mass [144], with minor contributions
from other fuel properties. A higher liquid density at constant injection
pressure typically also leads to longer liquid spray penetration [145,
146].

4.1.2. Viscosity

The liquid viscosity of OMEx increases strongly with the chain
length. Only OME5 has a viscosity that lies within the EN590 range,
while OME1 is an order of magnitude lower. Low fuel viscosity can lead
to issues in the fuel system, e.g. due to seal leakage, but even the low
viscosity of OME1 seems to be high enough to avoid these issues [147],
while uncontrolled fuel leakage was encountered with DME, which has
an even lower viscosity [148]. Fuel viscosity also plays a significant
role in fuel spray breakup, with a higher viscosity slowing down spray
breakup by suppressing surface instabilities and increasing the resulting
Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of spray droplets [146,149]. Finally, fuel
viscosity is closely related to the fuel’s lubricating properties, which are
discussed in Section 4.1.4.

4.1.3. Surface tension

The surface tension of OMEx is of the same magnitude as fossil
diesel fuel, about twice to thrice the surface tension of DME, and,
similar to the viscosity, increases with chain length. Surface tension
influences spray breakup, with higher surface tension delaying droplet
breakup [149]. However, the effect of surface tension was found to
be substantially smaller than that of viscosity [146], so no significant
impact of the difference in surface tension between different OMEx and
fossil diesel fuel is expected. Furthermore, in the Weber number, which
is relevant for droplet breakup, the increased surface tension for the
larger OMEx is at least partly compensated by the increased density.

4.1.4. Lubricity

In diesel engines, the fuel itself must lubricate the moving parts
of the high-pressure injection system. Fossil diesel fuel contains polar
compounds, which are mainly responsible for forming a protective
layer on metal surfaces and preventing excessive wear. As the process
of hydrotreating, commonly performed on modern diesel fuel to reduce
sulfur levels, also destroys some of these compounds, lubricity additives
were developed and are commonly employed to reach the necessary
minimum lubricity as defined by EN590 [150]. Among the group of
OMEx, only OME5 reaches this level without additives, while with
decreasing chain length, lubricity deteriorates. However, it was shown
that with appropriate additives, the necessary lubricity can be achieved.

Härtl et al. [24] used 6 %(m∕m) of a mixture of 50 %(m∕m) polyethylene
glycol dimethyl ether and 50 %(m∕m) SYNALOXTM40-D700 as an ad-
ditive in neat OMEx to simultaneously improve lubricity and cetane
number, and reported an improvement of lubricity from 759 μm to
297 μm measured on a standardized high-frequency reciprocating rig
(HFFR). In a follow-up study, Härtl et al. [151] added 300 ppm di-
n-decyl ether to a blend of OME3−6. Pélerin et al. [152] used 300 ppm
of di-n-decyl ether in OME1 to achieve a lubricity of 543 μm.

4.1.5. Freezing temperatures, boiling temperatures, and vapor pressure

The freezing point of all OMEx except OME5 is low enough to be
used even in cold climates. Even the high freezing point of OME5 is
not an issue when it is used in a blend with other short-chain OMEx.
For example, a cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of −18 °C was mea-
sured for a commercial blend of OME3−5 containing up to 30 weight%
OME5 [63]. The freezing point of a typical mass-produced mixture
containing 42.7 weight% OME3, 33.2 weight% OME4 and 24.1 weight%
OME5 is −23.3 °C, and of a blend of 20 weight% OME3−8 in fossil diesel
still −7.8 °C [153]. As comparison, DIN EN590 requires a CFFP ranging
from −20 °C during winter to 0 °C during summer for conventional
fossil diesel fuel [128]. These results confirm that long-chain OME5−8
with very high freezing points can be used in practical fuel blends up
to a certain content. Issues with the miscibility of fuel blends at low
temperatures are discussed in Section 4.1.10.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10117314

H. Pitsch et al.

The boiling point and the corresponding vapor pressure are likely
the most important difference between OME1 and longer chain OMEx.
While OME3−5 exhibit boiling points in a similar range to the initial
boiling point of fossil diesel fuel, particularly OME1 has a boiling point
close to ambient temperature, similar to gasoline, and thus must be
treated similarly when it comes to the fuel supply system.

4.1.6. Heating value

The heating value of all OMEx is significantly lower than that of
diesel fuel by about a factor of two and decreases with increasing chain
length. The simultaneous increase in density with increasing chain
length counteracts this, resulting in almost constant volumetric heating
value for all chain lengths. For a similar range compared to fossil diesel,
the fuel tank of a vehicle to be operated with any OMEx must hold
a larger volume, also increasing vehicle weight. The heating value
has significant impact on engine operation, as it directly correlates
with engine power, and changes to the injection system in terms of
injection duration, injection pressure, or injector nozzle diameter are
necessary when utilizing OMEx to achieve similar engine power as with
conventional diesel fuel. The detrimental effects of the reduced heating
value are discussed in detail in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.

4.1.7. Cetane number

The cetane number is a measure for the ignitability of a fuel in com-
pression ignition engines. The lower the cetane number, the longer the
ignition delay after start of injection, affecting the ratio between pre-
mixed and diffusion controlled combustion and thereby engine noise,
efficiency, and emissions. A higher cetane number was found to im-
prove engine efficiency and reduce engine-out emissions [154]. For
OME2−5, the derived cetane number (DCN) is above the minimum
cetane number of 51 specified in EN590 for diesel fuel. In the case
of OME1, the DCN is 28 and hence significantly lower, which might
lead to issues if used in unaltered diesel engines. The low DCN and its
consequences on the suitability of OME1 in a fuel blend are discussed
in more detail in Goeb et al. [155].

4.1.8. Safety and toxicity

The flash point of a fuel determines the temperature above which
fuel vapor ignites when exposed to an ignition source. For safety
reasons, a high flash point is desirable. For example, gasoline has a
flash point significantly below 0 ◦C, an initial boiling point below
35 ◦C and is classified as extremely flammable liquid and vapor (cat-
egory 1 flammable liquid) under the globally harmonized system of
classification and labeling of chemicals (GHS), while Diesel with a
much higher flash point is classified as flammable liquid and vapor
(category 3 flammable liquid). OME3−5 have the advantage that they
retain the GHS flammability safety classification of diesel fuel due to
their flash point above 23 ◦C, while OME1−2 are classified as highly
flammable liquid and vapor (category 2 flammable liquid). ASTM D975
requires diesel fuel #1 to have a flash point above 38 °C, and diesel
fuel #2 to have a flash point above 52 °C. The former can be met by
OME3−5, the latter by OME4−5 or blends of OMEx with high enough
OME4−5 content. Vertin et al. [147] investigated the flammability of
OME1 and blends with diesel fuel in a fuel tank, and found that for
neat OME1 the flammability range is −32 ◦C to −4 ◦C. Above the
latter temperature, the air-vapor mixture in the tank is above the rich
flammability limit, below the former temperature it is below the lean
limit. In cold climates, addition of an even more volatile component
might be benefital for safety reasons to decrease the upper flammability
limit.

OME1 is used as solvent in various chemical products ranging from
adhesives to cosmetic products and therefore has a well-documented
toxicological profile. Unlike conventional diesel fuel, it is not acutely
toxic and not hazardous to the aquatic environment. OMEx with longer
chain lengths are not as commonly used, but it is generally assumed
that these are also non-toxic [24,49,135].

For OME1, a relatively low reactivity and corresponding long atmo-
spheric life time of 2–4 days was found [156], so that it can be assumed
that most OME1 emissions into the atmosphere, e.g. from incomplete
combustion or evaporation, will be deposited by rainout before they
undergo photochemical reactions forming ozone [147].

One significant shortcoming of OMEx is their high water solubility,
which is multiple orders of magnitude higher than the water solu-
bility for diesel fuel (283–481 g∕kg compared to less than 0.1 g∕kg for
diesel) [37]. This makes separation of spilled OMEx from water much
more difficult and might thus hinder the market introduction due to
environmental concerns. The water solubility also impacts storage, in
particular in fuel blends, which is discussed in Section 4.1.10.

4.1.9. Material compatibility

OMEx are generally not corrosive to metals, with a copper strip
corrosion grade 1, the lowest category and the same as fossil diesel
fuel [27,147,157], whereas for, e.g., methanol and ethanol, steel cor-
rosion has been reported in the past [158].

However, as OMEx are powerful solvents, they are chemically in-
compatible with some common elastomers used in fuel systems, e.g., in
sealings. While the hydrocarbons constituting fossil diesel fuel are
non-polar, the presence of oxygen in the chain of OMEx and the corre-
sponding dipole moment make OMEx strongly polar molecules [159].
Typical polar elastomer sealings swell up and, worst case, lose function
when encountering a polar fuel such as OMEx. Non-polar elastomers on
the other hand are resistant to polar OMEx, but will be susceptible to
non-polar conventional diesel fuel.

Subjected to neat OMEx, fluorocarbon (FKM) and nitrile rubbers
(NBR) can exhibit volume increases in the range of 100 % [27], corre-
sponding to unacceptable increases of thickness and elongation in the
range of 25 % [147]. Swelling is less severe with lower OMEx content,
but still significant [27,147]. Ethylene propylene diene monomer rub-
ber (EPDM) shows significantly better behavior with neat OMEx, but
in turn swells in paraffinic diesel fuel [152]. Only perfluoroelastomer
(FFKM) and polytetrafluorethylen (PTFE) are suitable for operation
with both OMEx as well as diesel fuel and blends of the two [152].
Fig. 11 shows the change of weight for a range of sealing materials
after exposure to different OMEx as well as paraffinic diesel fuel,
showcasing the issues with standard FKM and NBR sealings as well
as the advantageous behavior of FFKM and PTFE. The viability of the
latter materials for operation with blends of OMEx with diesel fuel was
also shown in practice. Replacement of all sealings by FFKM [151] or
PTFE [63] allowed for extensive engine operation without any reported
sealing issues. EPDM was reportedly suitable for neat OMEx, but not for
diesel fuel [151].

4.1.10. Storage and miscibility

OMEx exhibit very good storage properties. A mixture of OME2−6
showed no residue and no property changes after being stored for 24
weeks [27]. Also with neat OME1 as well as blends of it with fossil
diesel fuel, no peroxides and no increase in gum was found after five
months at 40 °C [147].

There is large interest in using OMEx as a component in blends with
either fossil diesel fuel, or synthetic renewable diesel such as Fischer–
Tropsch (FT) diesel or HVO. This allows for utilizing its emission
reduction potential as discussed in Section 5 and to balance its fuel
properties to fulfill EN590. Fortunately, OMEx generally exhibit good
solubility in diesel fuel and diesel fuel substitutes. OME1 is soluble in
fossil diesel throughout the blending range [26,147]. This is generally
also true for longer-chain OMEx [24,65]. However, it was found that
blends containing significant fractions of OMEx>2 have a cloud point
higher than acceptable for common diesel fuel, effectively limiting
the blending range for practical applications [63]. The cloud point
increases for higher contents of OME3−5 in both fossil diesel and
HVO, indicating blend component separation [63]. This is much more
pronounced for HVO, where all of the prepared OME3−5 blends with

chamber experiments. Neat OME1 to OME4, fossil diesel fuel and two blends of fossil
diesel with 35 vol% OME1 and 26 vol% OME3−5, respectively. 3-hole piezo injector with

an OMEx volume fraction of 35 vol% exhibit a cloud point above 0 °C,
which makes such blends unsuitable for practical usage, even though
the cloud point of the examined neat HVO was much lower than that
of fossil diesel [63]. Addition of OME2 to the OMEx mixture improved
solubility and reduced the cloud point to −10 °C [63].

Theoretical calculations were able to confirm these practical find-
ings. According to calculations of the liquid–liquid equilibrium, the
miscibility of OMEx decreases with the chain length, and increases with
the aromatics content of the other blend component [160,161]. Most
common diesel additives improve the miscibility of OMEx in diesel fuel,
with the notable exception of a pour point depressant [160].

Lastly, OMEx and HVO separate when stored for a longer time. This
is rooted in small amounts of ambient water taken up by the mixture
which brings an inherent incompatibility between the components into
play, resulting in a split where the OMEx fraction contains almost all
of the water and the HVO fraction almost none of it [162]. This means
that for storing blends of OMEx and HVO, either the humidity of the
gas phase must be reduced or a solubilizer must be employed [162].

4.2. Spray behavior

Due to their different liquid fuel properties, also a significantly
different spray behavior of OMEx compared to fossil diesel fuel and
common diesel fuel surrogates can be expected. However, while various
studies on the overall engine performance and emissions of OMEx exist,
which are in the focus of Section 5, detailed investigations of the liquid
fuel spray are sparse.

Nozzle-internal flow simulation results suggest that OME1 does
not exhibit more cavitation inside the nozzle compared to the diesel
surrogate n-dodecane despite the significantly different vapor pres-
sure [163]. For OMEx>1, flash boiling is not relevant under typical
engine conditions. Only at low ambient pressure, flash boiling signif-
icantly impacts the fuel spray [164]. The macroscopic liquid spray, far
from the nozzle, also looks very similar to diesel fuel for high ambient
pressures, with the spray cone being very slightly wider for OME1 [163]
and OME3−5 [31,165] compared to diesel fuel. The penetration length
of the liquid fuel spray, however, is significantly lower for the low
boiling point fuel OME1 compared to the longer chained OME4 and
diesel fuel as shown by Ottenwälder et al. [166] and Goeb et al. [167].
Within their work, spray chamber measurements were performed with
OME1 to OME4 as well as with diesel fuel and blends of OME1 with

diesel fuel and a mixture of OME3−5 with diesel fuel. In Fig. 12, the
resulting liquid penetration lengths (LPL) and vapor penetration lengths
(VPL) are shown together with other OMEx as well as the fuel blends.
The vapor penetration is mainly driven by the injection momentum,
which is the same for all fuels. Thus, also the VPL of all fuels is very
similar, with the exception of the OME1-diesel blend. The increasing
vapor pressure (as represented by the boiling point in Table 2) and
viscosity for longer OMEx chain length lead to significant increases
in LPL, more than doubling from OME1 to OME4. Even though the
initial boiling point of fossil diesel is in the same range as the boiling
point of OME3−4, the final boiling point of fossil diesel is larger than
300 °C, and these higher boiling components likely contribute to the
longer liquid penetration in comparison. Other spray chamber mea-
surements performed by various groups using different injectors and
operating conditions largely confirm the VPL and GPL trends discussed
above [165,169,170]. Pastor et al. [169] also found that under reactive
conditions, the VPL of the fuel differs more strongly, with fuels igniting
earlier also penetrating deeper. The impact of the nozzle hole diameter
on the droplet diameter distribution is negligible, but the VPL increases
with increasing diameter [170].

The impact of the nozzle diameter on the fuel spray is generally
similar with OMEx fuels compared to common diesel fuel, n-dodecane
or HVO. With a larger diameter, liquid penetration increases due to
higher momentum flux [171].

In their work, Goeb et al. [167] also performed large-eddy simu-
lations (LES) with state-of-the-art spray breakup models, and stated
that despite the significantly different properties, the proven models for
diesel spray simulations can also be applied to OMEx with reasonable
results even without recalibration of model parameters. Parameter
studies performed as part of that work have shown that, at least in the
utilized modeling framework, vapor pressure is the dominant driver for
the different LPLs, while viscosity and surface tension play a minor role.
Overall, the available detailed spray investigations largely confirm
the expectations based on the liquid fuel properties. For OME3−5, the
liquid spray behavior is very similar to that of diesel fuel when the
same nozzle is utilized, likely also resulting in very similar mixing
as well as wall impingement. Based on these findings, no mandatory
engine geometry modifications for the utilization of OME3−5 or blends
with diesel fuel are to be expected. This assessment, however, no
longer holds when the significantly lower heating value is considered.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10117316

H. Pitsch et al.

If the injector nozzle diameter is increased to achieve similar energy
density flow, LPL as well as VPL change, so that differences in mixture
formation as well as spray-wall-interaction compared to the baseline
engine can be expected and additional optimization might be required.
For example, with an injector nozzle with doubled volume flow for
OME3−5, a reduced cone angle and thus stronger wall impingement
of the liquid spray onto the piston bowl was found [172]. This might
contribute to the higher wall heat losses, which were found in this case.
For OME1, as expected, the liquid penetration is significantly shorter.
However, for relevant blends with diesel fuel, the properties become
again similar enough to neat diesel that the assessment above likely
holds.

4.3. Future research perspectives

The discussion of fuel properties in Section 4.1 highlighted the
main differences between OMEx and diesel fuel, such as liquid density,
heating value, and cetane number.

For predictive simulations of fuel sprays, accurate temperature-
dependent fuel properties are required. For OME1, such properties are
well documented in the literature. However, for OMEx>1, only data
under standard conditions can be found. It would be highly desirable
to have such data from measurements available for accurate fuel spray
simulations. For validation of typically used mixing rules, also some
measurements of fuel blends, e.g., with common diesel surrogates,
would be helpful.

In recent years, lab experiments have significantly improved the
understanding of the material compatibility of OMEx with common
sealing materials, and suggestions for suitable materials have been
made. An appropriate next step would now be to perform long term
studies of the durability of the suggested sealings in engine operation
in actual vehicles to rule out any undesirable effects before possi-
bly a large number of vehicles is retro-fitted or manufactured using
OMEx-compatible seals and piping.

Some studies have recently been published which investigated the
spray formation with OMEx under engine-relevant conditions, but still
more research will be necessary to fully understand the differences in
mixture formation and flame characteristics arising from the different
fuel properties of OMEx compared to fossil diesel. Finally, more re-
search on the nozzle-internal flow behavior as well as, in the case of
OME1, flash boiling would be helpful to improve nozzle designs for
OME1-containing fuels.

5. Engine application and emissions

OMEx can be utilized as neat fuel in state-of-the-art compression
ignition engines after few modifications. However, due to the possibly
advantageous blending properties, blends of OMEx with other fuels,
like, e.g., fossil diesel fuel, have also gathered considerable research
attention. Overall, a large amount of experimental and some numerical
work regarding engine operation and emissions have been published
for various OMEx and OMEx blends. This section aims to condense,
compare, analyze, and consolidate these data. The focus lies on the
impact of the particularly interesting properties of OMEx, such as their
potential for soot reduction, possibly breaking the soot-NOx trade-
off by allowing for more EGR, and thus overall significantly lowered
engine-out emissions, and their chain-length dependent cetane number.
First, in Section 5.1, necessary and optional modifications for uti-
lizing OMEx fuels compared to existing conventional diesel engine
designs and control strategies are outlined. In Section 5.2, the impact of
OMEx in fuel blends on the combustion process and thus on the engine
efficiency is discussed. Engine-out emissions as well as aftertreatment
options are then compared and analyzed in Sections 5.3 to 5.6. This
work focuses on conventional CI engine combustion modes using blends
of OMEx with fossil diesel or similar fuels. For a review of advanced
combustion modes such as homogeneous charge compression ignition
or partially premixed compression ignition, as well as for an overview
of work conducted on blends including gasoline fuel, the reader is
referred to the review by Liu et al. [173].

5.1. Modifications to engine control and design

OMEx has two properties which necessarily require changes to
engine design and control. First, as described in Section 4.1.9, OMEx
are incompatible with certain sealing and piping materials, which have
to be replaced before safe long-term engine operation is possible. Sec-
ond, the reduced heating value of fuels containing OMEx necessitates
counter measures to achieve the same indicated mean effective pressure
(IMEP), since without adaption the engine power output reduces signif-
icantly [174,175]. In addition to the necessary changes due to material
compatibility and heating value, as well as the vapor pressure in case
of OME1, other optional changes are possible to reap the full benefit
of OMEx fuels. Some possible changes are discussed in the following as
well.

5.1.1. Injection duration and nozzle modifications

The required increase in injected mass can be achieved easiest
by increasing the injection duration, up to almost double for neat
OME1 [24]. This, however, has an impact on mixing and thus emis-
sions. The injection duration for OMEx is longer, thus the maximum
nozzle flow rate is already reached at low load points. Therefore,
any increase in load directly relates to a similar increase in injection
duration. In contrast, for diesel fuel, the mass flow has not yet reached
its steady maximum during the shorter necessary injection duration at
part load, as the transient run-in phase of the nozzle is not completed.
Thus, any further increase of the opening duration of the injector leads
to a doubled effect of an increased injection duration as well as of a
higher maximum mass flow. As a consequence, in contrast to OME,
only moderate increases in injection duration are required for diesel
fuel. These still increasing nozzle flow rates under increasing load in
case of diesel fuel lead to improved mixing because of higher droplet
velocities and faster break-up with load increase. This results in a
significant increase in maximum rate of heat release for diesel fuel,
and a corresponding increase of NOx and decrease of PM and unburned
hydrocarbon emissions, as discussed by Pélerin et al. [152]. Contrary
to this, there is almost no change in peak heat release for OMEx, as
the nozzle mass flow rate has already reached its maximum at lower
loads [152]. Due to the increase in maximum temperature accompanied
with a higher peak heat release, the combustion duration also reduces
for diesel fuel under higher loads. For OMEx, the combustion duration
is governed by the injection duration, which increases with higher
loads [152]. This effect reduces and, at worst, reverses the efficiency
advantage of OMEx compared to diesel fuel at high loads and indicates
that higher nozzle mass flow rates are desirable for OMEx.

Alternatively, the injector nozzle mass flow rates can be changed,
e.g., by increasing the nozzle diameters. While such change requires
higher effort, advantages in terms of engine efficiency are expected [152,
174,176–178]. This was shown, e.g., by Härtl et al. [178] in a single
cylinder engine using three different nozzle diameters, a base nozzle, a
nozzle with increased diameter corresponding to the same energy flow
rate as with diesel fuel, and a nozzle with further increased diameter to
allow for reduced rail pressure while maintaining energy density flow.
With OME1, additivized to increase the cetane number significantly,
they showed lower efficiency by about 2 percentage points throughout
the engine map with the unmodified nozzle, but improved efficiency
by about 1 percentage point for the largest nozzle with reduced rail
pressure. Soot mass remained negligible for all nozzles. When the
nozzle diameter is increased, ignition delay increases slightly as well
due to worse mixing, as shown in a comparison of the ECN Spray A
and D nozzles [171]. This effect is however not very pronounced for
OME3−5 and actually reverses for OME1, where the resulting richer
mixtures promote ignition [171,179]. Parravicini et al. [180] followed
a different approach and used injectors with an increasing number
of nozzle holes for increasing OME3−4 content in a blend with diesel
fuel, keeping rail pressure, duration of injection, and injected energy
constant. The higher number of nozzles leads to earlier interaction of

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10117317

H. Pitsch et al.

the spray cones, resulting in a limitation of the diffusion-controlled
combustion phase by oxygen availability in case of diesel fuel. With
OME3−4 blends, thus containing oxygen in the fuel, this effect was
much less pronounced, and a simultaneous increase of number of holes
and OME3−4 fraction in the fuel only resulted in an increase of the
premixed combustion heat release peak, but relatively similar diffusion
combustion heat release peak.

The typical disadvantages of lower rail pressure, which for diesel
fuel are mainly a rise in particulate emissions and CO because of
poorer mixing, are not present with neat OMEx. Thus, the rail pressures
could be decreased to improve engine efficiency and reduce component
cost [177]. This, however, requires adapted nozzle geometries to allow
for large enough injection rates as already discussed. This improved
behavior with OMEx at low rail pressure is also relevant under transient
conditions, where a load step can be immediately realized by extended
injection duration without the necessity to wait for rail pressure build-
up, if the total injection duration does not become too long to reduce
engine efficiency significantly [152].

A third option to achieve the desired injected mass, conversely,
is increasing the rail pressure to increase the mass flow through the
nozzle [48]. This is, however, accompanied by increased cost and
decreased engine efficiency.

5.1.2. OME1-specific changes due to vapor pressure

For OME1 in particular, the low vapor pressure poses an additional
challenge, which might prevent its use as a fuel component. For any
application, OME1 would have to be handled like gasoline fuel. The
fuel tank must be sealed and requires an evaporative emission control
system (EVAP) [63]. Vertin et al. [147] additionally suggest that a
quick-disconnect type dispensing nozzle equipped with a vapor recov-
ery system would be required to prevent sudden release of fugitive
emissions while refueling, which would pose a flammability hazard.
They reported a vapor pressure of up to 2.75 bar at 71 °C, temperatures
which can be reached in almost empty fuel tanks due to the way diesel
engines use fuel to cool the fuel systems. Omari et al. [26] additionally
pressurized the fuel tank when operating with OME1 to eliminate the
risk of cavitation in the fuel pump, and Härtl et al. [24] pressurized the
fuel back flow to 10 bar to avoid vapor bubbles. Zhu et al. [181] report
vapor lock in the fuel supply pump, resulting in significant power drop,
with a blend containing 50 vol% OME1.

5.1.3. Shift of injection timing and multi-injection

The injection timing may be shifted to achieve constant combustion
timing, i.e., crank angle of 50 % of fuel mass burned (MFB50 or CA50),
for different OMEx and OMEx blends, counteracting the different ig-
nition delays and combustion durations [26,152]. Without adaption
of the injection timing for OMEx-containing blends, the lower heating
value and corresponding longer injection duration lead to a delayed
MFB50 and thereby efficiency loss [144]. This was also confirmed in
a passenger vehicle study, where without changes to engine control,
engine efficiency dropped with increasing OMEx content in the diesel
fuel [174]. An ad-hoc engine control calibration by a closed loop system
or a blend detection system might be very beneficial if largely varying
fuel blends are to be burnt in the same engine.

For OME1 without cetane enhancing additives, the very long ig-
nition delay particularly at low loads can lead to an unusually large
share of premixed combustion, leading to a very high peak in heat
release rate and high mechanical stress on the engine [152,181,182].
This effect is stronger with higher EGR, which further increases ignition
delay times [182]. To avoid this, a pilot injection can be used, which
completely removes this effect and smoothens the heat release curve
similar to OME3−5 [152].

Also for more enhanced multi-injection strategies, the reduced heat-
ing value of OMEx compared to diesel fuel should be taken into
account. If the injected mass of the pilot injection, for example, is not
appropriately increased, the effect of the pilot injection on the main

ignition might be reduced due to its lower heat release [183]. On the
other side, the necessity of a pilot injection itself might be questioned
when the highly reactive OME3−5 is used as fuel, as negligible differ-
ences for the main ignition delay as well as the maximum rate of heat
release were found for a range of engine loads [152].

5.1.4. Increase of EGR and simplification of aftertreatment

In state-of-the-art CI engines fueled with fossil diesel, PM and NOx
emissions are closely coupled through the EGR rate, with increased EGR
reducing NO emissions and increasing PM emissions. OMEx-containing
fuels produce significantly less soot, and thus the EGR rate can be
significantly increased to also reduce engine-out NOx emissions. The
EGR variation impact is discussed in detail in the sections focusing on
soot emissions (Section 5.3) and nitric oxide emissions (Section 5.4),
but generally, the range of possible EGR rates increases significantly
when OMEx is part of the fuel. For fuel blends not leading to fully soot-
free combustion, the OMEx content in the blend still allows for smaller
increases of EGR due to the lower sooting tendency, without changing
the engine operation strategy entirely. The combined reduction of both
NOx and PM emissions allows for simplified after-treatment systems
while still maintaining or exceeding current emission regulations. Re-
generation intervals of a diesel particulate filter (DPF) can be increased,
reducing fuel consumption [184], and a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC)
combined with a lean NOx trap might be sufficient for NOx reduction.
Existing older vehicles can potentially achieve compliance with newer
emission regulations without the installation of costly after-treatment
when operated with a fuel blend containing significant fractions of
OMEx and corresponding changes to the engine map are made.

5.1.5. Stoichiometric CI operating strategy

The advantageous properties of OMEx, in particular breaking the
NOx-soot tradeoff, allow for entirely different engine operation and
emission aftertreatment strategies, some of which are not possible with
conventional diesel fuel in common CI engines. For neat OMEx or
blends with very high OMEx content, operation at stoichiometric con-
ditions achieved by high amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is
possible, as soot emissions remain negligible, see Section 5.3. The high
EGR also reduces NOx to extremely low values as shown in Section 5.4.
The aftertreatment can then be significantly simplified by employing
a three-way catalyst as utilized in SI engines. Operating under such
high EGR at stoichiometric conditions, however, massively increases
CO and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions, mainly methane which is
difficult to convert in aftertreatment, as discussed in Sections 5.5 and
5.6. This also results in a measurable drop in thermal efficiency, making
fully stoichiometric operation throughout the engine map unattractive.
Operation in a high EGR range, but under still lean conditions above an
air fuel equivalence ratio of λ = 1.1, similar to the strategy published by
Upatnieks et al. [185], prohibits the use of a three-way catalyst, but it
also eliminates the increased CO, the unburnt hydrocarbon emissions,
and the corresponding drops in engine efficiency, but also disables the
possibility of NOx reduction in a three-way catalyst. Limiting the engine
to high EGR, lean operation also reduces maximum power output
significantly. A combined operating strategy was suggested by Ogawa
et al. [182]. They combined a high EGR lean operating strategy for low
loads with a stoichiometric operation and a three-way catalyst at high
loads to achieve very low NOx throughout the engine operating range.
For the stoichiometric operation at higher loads, further load increases
necessitate a reduction of the EGR rates to maintain the air-fuel-ratio.
However, due to stoichiometric operation, the three-way catalyst was
able to simultaneously reduce the resulting NOx, CO, and hydrocarbon
emissions very effectively. At low to medium loads, EGR was kept at
30 % under lean λ-controlled combustion to avoid excessive emissions
of partially oxidized combustion products and achieve high thermal
efficiency. The catalyst was effective at converting remaining CO and
hydrocarbon emissions, while NOx emissions remained low without
after-treatment due to the high EGR rate.

5.1.6. Engine geometry modifications

Besides the injection system, also the piston geometry holds po-
tential for optimization and, especially for operation with neat OMEx,
adjustments might be beneficial. The different liquid fuel properties
affect fuel break-up, and so does a larger injection nozzle to accom-
modate for the reduced heating value compared to diesel fuel. Thus,
piston bowl designs for diesel fuel might be less optimal for neat OMEx.
For instance, Gaukel et al. [186] have performed an optimization of
the piston bowl shape for the highly volatile OME1 using numerical
simulations and experiments. They suggest a step-shaped bowl for
OME1 due to better mixture formation at high EGR rates.

5.2. Combustion process and engine efficiency

Sections 5.1 and 5.1.5 discussed how in particular injection timings
and durations as well as EGR rates are subject to changes when oper-
ating a CI engine designed for diesel fuel with a fuel containing OMEx.
The resulting consequences for the combustion process as well as the
impact on overall engine efficiency will be discussed in more detail in
the following.

The theoretical maximum engine power output is higher with neat
OMEx, as no smoke limit approaching stoichiometric operation ex-
ists [182]. In practice, operation near stoichiometric conditions without
EGR, however, leads to excessive NOx emissions

When trying to approach λ < 1.1 with significant EGR rates to limit
NOx, thermal efficiency with OMEx drops significantly due to higher
fresh gas temperature because of high EGR, extended burn duration,
worse process gas heat capacities, and incomplete combustion [151,
177,187]. This drop, however, appears at significantly lower air-fuel-
ratio compared to, e.g., HVO, thus still allowing for a much wider
operating range of the engine [187].

Utilization of pure OMEx or addition of OMEx to diesel fuel under
typical CI engine operation generally improves engine efficiency due to
changes to the heat release rate. Fig. 13 shows a typical heat release
profile of OMEx compared to diesel fuel.

The necessary longer injection duration due to the lower heating
value leads to a lower rate of maximum heat release and a longer main
burning phase [63,151,152,187]. However, the heat is released closer
to TDC leading to a shorter burn-out phase [24,26,63,151,152,176,187,
188]. As the latter effect is more important than the former, overall this
results in a shorter, more isochoric total combustion phase and thus
in higher efficiency. Quantitatively, engine efficiency improvements
in the range of 1–5 % were reported for neat OMEx [24,63,152] or
blends with high OMEx content above 35 vol% [26,180,181]. Without
modified injector geometry, this efficiency benefit is smaller or vanishes
entirely for high loads and high OMEx content due to the long necessary
injection durations, i.e., the maximum rate of heat release is limited
by the maximum nozzle flow rate resulting in a longer combustion
duration than desired [26,63,151,152,177]. With an injector diameter
optimized for OMEx instead of for diesel fuel, the efficiency advantage
possibly widens to up to 6 % [189]. Increasing the injection pres-
sure can also help to counteract the lower energy density of neat
OMEx, improving the efficiency [48]. Comparing different OMEx chain
lengths, the efficiency benefit decreases slightly with increasing chain
length [63,187,190] due to a slightly longer combustion duration and
lower peak heat release. As the volumetric heating value is roughly
the same between the fuels and the cetane number increases with the
chain length, which should theoretically improve engine efficiency, one
possible explanation for this could be the higher volatility of smaller
OMEx chain lengths [187]. This could lead to better mixing in the
diffusion-controlled combustion phase, resulting in higher rate of heat
release.

When blending OME3−5 into diesel fuel without optimizing the
injector nozzle diameter, thermal efficiency first drops with increasing
OME3−5 content, but then increases again towards neat OME3−5 [144,
191]. At high OME3−5 contents, the advantageous cetane number and

fast burn-out over-compensate for the long necessary injection dura-
tion [144,191].

The reason for the overall shorter combustion duration and thus
higher thermal efficiency with OMEx despite the possibly much longer
injection durations lie in the significantly faster diffusion-controlled
second combustion phase roughly between MFB50 to MFB90, resulting
in less remaining fuel to be inefficiently burned in the late burning
phase. The molecular oxygen content and thus the reduced demand
for air entrainment and mixing is commonly seen as main contributor
to this effect [152,187,189]. This can be corroborated by OH* chemi-
luminescence images and engine simulations, which show a larger
combustion zone with OMEx [183,192]. Fig. 14 shows OH* chemilu-
minescence during engine operation, comparing OMEx with diesel fuel.
Around peak heat release at about 9 CAD aTDC, there are significantly
smaller dark blue areas, corresponding to regions without combustion,
for OMEx. Please note that the absence of OH* chemiluminescence
in the piston bowl in case of diesel fuel at this time is likely due to
shielding of the radiation by soot [183,192].

Additional contributors could be the higher volatility, resulting in
faster evaporation, and the lower soot formation, resulting in less soot
oxidation in the late combustion phase [187]. The assumption that the
diffusion combustion process with OMEx is faster because it happens
closer to the nozzle due to the intramolecular oxygen [189] can how-
ever be disproved by spray chamber experiments under engine-relevant
conditions. In these experiments, the flame lift-off length (FLOL) with
OMEx was consistently similarly long or longer than with n-dodecane,
a diesel surrogate which has a similarly high cetane number, but no
fuel oxygen [166,167,169,193].

The FLOL increases with increasing OMEx fraction. This effect is
stronger at lower ambient temperatures. Here, the lower LHV of OMEx
and the resulting lower flame temperatures, which lead to a longer

FLOL, dominate over the improved ignitability of OMEx at these tem-
peratures, which on its own would lead to a smaller FLOL [193]. This is
supported by the increased fuel composition effect on ignition delay at
higher ambient temperatures, i.e., at higher temperatures, the higher
cetane number of OMEx is better able to compensate for the smaller
heating value [193].

All investigated fuels stabilize downstream of the nozzle under rich
local conditions, except OME1, where the extremely long ignition delay
leads to an FLOL at roughly stoichiometric conditions [169]. A side
effect of the longer FLOL and thus a longer distance between liquid fuel
spray and flame is expected to be an improved mixing and thus lower
sooting tendency [166]. It was also found that the maximum stationary
flame length is lower with OMEx, which is explained based on the much
lower stoichiometric air-fuel-ratio [169].

5.3. Particulate matter emissions

As all oxygenated fuels, OMEx show significantly reduced par-
ticulate matter (PM) emissions. In a screening of a large range of
oxygenated fuels blended with diesel fuel such that all blends had
the same oxygen content, Härtl et al. [24] found that OME1 led to
the highest soot reduction. The work of Cheng et al. [194] on an
older engine, however, came to the opposite conclusion, with OME1
blends exhibiting slightly higher soot emissions than other oxygenates
with similar oxygen content by mass. As the discrepancies are rela-
tively small, this might be a difference in operating and/or injection
conditions, which will have a large impact on the volatile low-cetane
OME1. Under controlled, engine-relevant conditions in a spray cham-
ber, both OME1 and a mixture of OME3−5 showed no measurable soot
luminosity [169], indicating a very good potential of OMEx for soot
reduction. The following subsection summarizes and reviews various
soot measurements in engines, while reasons for the superlinear soot
reduction are analyzed and discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.2.

5.3.1. Engine measurements

For all neat OMEx, PM emissions are close to the detection limit un-
der normal engine operation conditions, even for extremely high EGR
rates [63,151,152,174,182,195]. While a reduction of soot formation
from fuel combustion to almost zero can be expected, engine-out or
tailpipe PM emissions do not reduce to zero, as other sources of PM
such as combustion of engine oil remain. This almost full PM emis-
sion reduction also holds for blends with diesel fuel down to 80 vol%
OME1 [26]. Lower OMEx content leads to increasing PM emissions
with decreasing OMEx content and with increasing EGR rate, so that
the common soot-NOx tradeoff is weakened, but not entirely broken.
Fig. 15 shows this exemplary for different OME1-diesel blends in two
different load points [26].

Some published data from engine measurements of fuel blends are
collected in Fig. 16, showing the reduction of PM emissions compared
to a fossil diesel reference over the volumetric content of OMEx in the
blend with fossil diesel. The figure covers a wide range of engines, from
single cylinder research engines over older Euro II production engines
to modern Euro VI engines with particulate filter, and a range of load
points or driving cycles.

The spread of the data exemplary given in Fig. 16 is obvious. The
quantitative amount of PM emission reduction is, among other aspects,
highly dependent on the engine and injector design, the chosen engine
map, and the operating conditions, i.e., load and speed. For the last
point, the general trend seems to suggest that the PM reduction is
more pronounced at lower loads [26,135,191]. This might be a mixture
formation effect due to the higher required injection duration for
OMEx. At low loads, OMEx-containing fuels show improved mixing due
to higher peak mass flow rates caused by the generally longer injection
durations as already discussed in Section 5.1.1. With increasing load,
diesel mixing still improves due to increasing maximum mass flow rates
through the nozzle, but for OMEx, mixing quality does not further

change. Interestingly, the soot reduction is almost independent of the
OMEx chain length, as with increasing chain length, the increased
soot production due to increasing cetane numbers (and thus reduced
ignition delay and poorer mixing) and the reduced soot production
and increased oxidation due to slightly increasing oxygen contents
counteract each other [63]. This is also shown in Fig. 17, where a
strong but very similar PM reduction at constant NOx emissions for all
different chain lengths is apparent.

Overall though, a clear trend can be extracted from the available
data: The PM emission reduction is very high even for low amounts
of OMEx in diesel fuel, and the absolute change reduces asymptot-
ically with larger amounts of OMEx, in line with findings for other
oxygenated fuels since the 1990s. Thus, the identification of an optimal
blend ratio for commercial introduction of such a fuel blend is an
important and challenging task. For example, Omari et al. [63] suggest
a blend content of 35 vol% OMEx in diesel fuel as compromise between
very high pollutant reduction on one side and low fuel costs and high

heating value of the fuel on the other side. The possible combined PM
and NOx emissions achievable with such a blend by choosing appropri-
ate EGR rates can be seen in Fig. 17. Chen et al. [199] recommend
a maximum of 20 vol% OMEx in diesel fuel in their review on the
assumption that no changes are made to engine control and injector
to limit the negative effects of the reduced lower heating value on
efficiency and engine power.

As PM are still formed and emitted, even a vehicle fueled with a
blend containing more OMEx would still require a particulate filter
to fulfill the current emission regulations [63], so that the main ad-
vantage of the engine-out PM emission reduction is the corresponding
possibility to reduce NOx emissions due to the eliminated or weakened
soot-NOx tradeoff while still maintaining extended active regeneration
intervals of the filter. Alternatively, an open channel particulate filter
could be employed, offering higher thermodynamic efficiency due to
lower exhaust back pressure [200]. If an engine is also supposed to be
operated on neat diesel fuel (flex-fuel engine), the full aftertreatment
system needs to remain in place.

Introduction of OMEx into a blend with diesel fuel also reduces the
soot particle number [63,176,198], and leads to a shift of the mean
particle size to smaller values [63,174,175,198]. This is surprising, as
investigations for other oxygenates such as biodiesel often showed the
opposite effect of increased PN at decreased total PM [201]. Particu-
larly for neat OME3−5, a significant reduction of the mean diameter was
found, with these particles probably largely resulting from combustion
of evaporating motor oil and not from fuel-induced soot [63], as also
indicated by a large volatile organic fraction originating from engine
lube in the PM emissions [174]. An electron microscope analysis com-
bined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed that the small soot
particles below 20 nm formed in OMEx combustion contain or are made
of mostly metal particles, likely partly contained in the fuel, partly from
the injection system and the lube oil [202]. The very smallest particles
below 10 nm, on the other hand, seem to consist mostly of volatile com-
ponents, as proven by measurements with a catalytic stripper [200].
For fuel blends of OME2−6 in diesel fuel in a stationary diesel engine,
a smooth shift towards smaller mean diameters, but no second peak at
very small diameters was detected for increasing OMEx content [198].
In a different engine under medium load, just a reduction in number but
no shift in particle size distribution was found for neat OMEx compared
to HVO as diesel substitute [187], possibly because of a different
engine lubrication or wear status. The particle number increases with
increased load [152]. The small particles are still efficiently filtered by
a diesel particulate filter [184,203], in contrast to assumptions made by
Omari et al. [63], but the filtering efficiency can suffer slightly [204].
In addition, the filter loading is decreased, resulting in lower pressure
loss and longer regeneration intervals, and the required regeneration
temperature is lower due to higher particle reactivity, all in all leading
to lower fuel consumption, when even small amounts of OMEx are
blended into diesel fuel [184,204–206]. It was also speculated that
the small particles could maybe be converted in an efficient diesel
oxidation catalyst [174,207]. This was, however, not confirmed by
studies with DOC, where soot particle number and mass remained
unchanged [176]. As shown in premixed ethylene flames doped with
OME2−4, the resulting soot particles contain slightly more oxygenated
functionalities, in particular C=O, making them more reactive in both
after-treatment systems as well as possibly more toxic [208,209].

Exhaust gas recirculation is a frequently applied measure to reduce
combustion temperature and thereby NOx emissions [210], as discussed
in Section 5.4. However, particulate emissions lead to fouling of EGR
components, such as cooler, valves, and pipes. A significant reduction
of the heat transfer in the EGR cooler or even blockage of the EGR line
can be the consequence, leading to a strong rise in NOx emissions [211].
Without soot emissions and, in case of neat OMEx, no sulfur in the fuel,
fouling is less of a concern and high EGR rates are also possible from a
durability point of view. In general, smaller PM diameters and higher

volatile content, as encountered with OMEx blends, increase EGR foul-
ing as they seem to be more likely to deposit at cold walls [211],
thereby possibly counteracting the overall reduction in PM emissions
in terms of EGR fouling. However, tests with blends of OME2−6 in
diesel fuel in a stationary combined heat and power unit showed
decreased EGR fouling and thereby reduced maintenance downtimes
and cost [198].

5.3.2. Analysis of soot reduction potential of OMEx

The soot reduction potential of OMEx in particular, and oxygenated
fuels in general, is not straightforward and still a topic of ongoing
research. While some authors report almost linear soot reduction with
oxygen mass fraction in the fuel, regardless of molecular composition
and other fuel properties [212,213], others come to a different con-
clusion [24,214,215]. Most studies agree that above around 30 % to
40 % oxygen mass fraction in the fuel, soot production is completely
suppressed [212,216]. González et al. [217] report similar total PM
levels for the same oxygen mass content with different oxygenates, but
different dry PM levels indicating that while total PM emissions mainly
depend on total oxygen content, the ratio between volatile PM fraction
and dry soot PM fraction changes with the fuel structure, which impacts
aftertreatment possibilities.

Multiple different reasons exist for the total engine-out PM re-
duction with OMEx, and the final reduction of soot emissions is a
combination of these with different contributions depending on the
conditions. These reasons are listed next.

Shift of equivalence ratio for given fuel-to-air mass ratio due to fuel
oxygen: Leaner flames are known to produce less soot. In case of
oxygenated fuels such as OMEx, the stoichiometric mixture fraction
increases, as less air or more fuel mass is required for complete com-
bustion. This means that production of major soot precursors, such
as acetylene or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), also shifts
towards higher mixture fractions. Assuming similar injector nozzle
mass flow rates, the local distribution of mixture fractions in the
reacting vapor phase will be somewhat similar though, resulting in an
overall significant reduction in the production of soot precursors. This
was shown by Goeb et al. [155] based on a combination of LES and
1D flamelet computations. Fig. 18 shows this based on the acetylene
production comparing n-dodecane as reference fuel and a blend of n-
dodecane with OME1. While the peak acetylene production reduces
in 1D flamelet space for the blend compared to neat n-dodecane, this
effect is not responsible for the observed reduction by an order of
magnitude of integral acetylene production in the LES domain. The
local mixture fraction distribution in the LES does not show significant
differences at higher mixture fractions, and thus the most important
factor in the overall reduced acetylene production in the LES is the shift
of acetylene production to higher mixture fraction values. This shift
is thus likely the most important contributor to the super-linear soot
reduction with OMEx. Engine simulations were able to reproduce this
effect of significantly lower local fuel-air equivalence ratios with neat
OMEx [192] and with OMEx blended with n-heptane [218], resulting
in qualitatively significantly lowered soot formation.

Molecular structure - lack of carbon–carbon bonds: Without carbon–
carbon bonds, formation of soot precursors such as acetylene is less
likely. Carbon atoms bonded to an oxygen atom tend to keep that
bond, so that they likely do not participate in formation of soot precur-
sors [18,194,216]. OMEx, just like DME, do not contain any C–C-bonds,
but as discussed in Section 3.1, the beta-scission of the beta-fuel radical
is a dominant fuel-consumption pathway and leads to formation of
methyl radicals. These can recombine to form C2 species. Consequently,
soot formation by OMEx fuel is not entirely suppressed by its molecular
structure. More importantly, this fuel effect cannot be responsible for
the superlinear reduction of soot found with OMEx in diesel fuel, as it
only affects the OMEx fraction of the blend. Thus, it likely plays a role
when comparing different oxygenates with similar oxygen content, but

is not the main driver for the overall superlinear soot reduction in fuel
blends.

Increased air entrainment upstream of the flame: If more air is en-
trained into the fuel jet before combustion, local equivalence ratios
are lower and soot formation is reduced. A higher FLOL likely also
means higher air entrainment up to the flame and thereby lower local
equivalence ratios, leading to less rich combustion and thereby less soot
formation [215]. The stationary FLOL of OMEx and blends of OMEx
with diesel fuel are generally longer compared to neat diesel fuel or
diesel surrogates [155,166,167,193]. This should correspond to a slight
increase in air entrainment, and thus reduced soot formation. This
effect can be quantified by the overlap number [219], which describes
the normalized distance between liquid spray and flame. A small or
negative overlap number will likely be associated with higher soot
formation, as not all liquid droplets are evaporated in the region of
the flame and thus local rich regions can be expected. Based on the
results by Goeb et al. [167] under the spray chamber conditions also
shown in Fig. 12, the overlap number in the stationary spray duration is
consistently around zero for OME4, indicating no significant interaction
between liquid spray and flame. On the other hand, for diesel fuel,
the overlap number is significantly negative, reaching below −0.5 in
the early combustion phase and only going towards zero in the later
combustion phase.

Changes in combustion mode: Similar to the longer FLOL, longer
ignition delay times also cause a shift in the shares of premixed-
and diffusion-controlled combustion, which changes sooting behavior.
Longer ignition delays lead to better mixing, a higher share of premixed
combustion and thus reduced soot formation. Only for OME1 there is a
clear trend towards a higher share of premixed combustion due to the
extremely low cetane number, which might contribute to its slightly
advantageous soot reduction compared to other OMEx. For OME2−5,
there is no clear trend towards more [24,180] or less [152,189] pre-
mixed combustion, as for example a changed injector with higher mass
flow or an altered ignition timing will have significant impact on this.
Considering that the changes in combustion mode seem to be minor, it

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10117322

H. Pitsch et al.

can be assumed that this effect only plays a minor role in overall soot
reduction with OMEx.

Changes in Temperature: Fuels containing OMEx generally exhibit
slightly higher cylinder-average temperatures [63,144,198], most likely
due to the more efficient diffusion phase of combustion. In general,
higher temperatures promote both soot formation as well as soot ox-
idation. However the general consensus is that the latter effect is
more pronounced, thus likely leading to an overall reduction of soot
emissions [187].

Spray and fuel properties: Fuel properties impact mixture formation
and temperature. The high vapor pressure especially of OME1 leads to
faster evaporation and mixture formation, thus decreasing the occur-
rence of rich pockets and hence soot formation. However, considering
the minor differences in soot emissions between the different OMEx
compared to the significant differences in vapor pressure or boiling
temperature, this effect cannot play a major role.

Increased oxidation of soot precursors and soot: Even if soot precursors
or soot are formed, an increased rate of oxidation can lead to lower
engine-out soot emissions. There is still some, even though very low,
flame luminosity with OME1, indicating that at least some soot is
formed even for neat OMEx during combustion, but likely fully oxidized
again [182]. Two effects with OMEx could promote soot oxidation:
First, fuel oxygen promotes the formation of OH, which is important
for soot and soot precursor oxidation particularly in rich regions [213,
220]. Second, a faster mixing rate during the late combustion phase
could lead to increased soot oxidation. For OMEx blends, significant
contribution of increased soot oxidation to the overall soot emission
reduction is reported, with some authors attributing the engine-out PM
reduction almost entirely to increased oxidation [144,196]. However,
while some increase of OH radical concentration is found with OMEx
in the fuel [167,193,221], it is likely not significant enough to be
solely responsible for the reduced engine-out emissions. On the other
hand, the mixing rate with neat OMEx and blends containing significant
OMEx is much higher compared to diesel fuel, at least for the majority
of the combustion phase [180,189]. This could significantly contribute
to increased soot oxidation under certain operating conditions, and is
consistent with the stoichiometry effect discussed as first point above
for soot formation, as it is also related to locally leaner mixtures.

5.4. Nitric oxide emissions

It is generally assumed that the thermal NOx formation pathway is
dominant under typical CI engine operating conditions. Both a higher
peak combustion temperature as well as longer residence time of the
burnt gas at high temperatures are the leading influencing factors
for thermal NOx. Following the assumption that NOx formation is
dominated by the thermal pathway, utilization of OMEx in place of
fossil diesel fuel leads to competing effects for in-cylinder NOx pro-
duction. First, the more complete combustion close to TDC observed
with OMEx results in a higher maximum temperature in the cylinder,
leading to slightly more NOx production for most load points [26,144,
181,198]. Second, the higher mixing rates with OMEx due its oxygen
content [180] together with a shorter main combustion phase [152] can
lead to overall lower residence times at high temperatures, reducing
thermal NOx formation, possibly outweighing the first effect. Specifi-
cally for OME1 with its very low cetane number, a high blend content
at very low engine loads additionally leads to a mostly lean premixed
fuel-air mixture at ignition. Thus, combustion becomes largely lean
premixed with a reduction of NOx emissions due to the low result-
ing temperatures [26]. With increasing chain length, the combustion
duration as well as the peak temperature decrease, the latter due
to increased heat capacity of the combustion products because of
higher CO2 content, overall resulting in slightly decreasing NOx emis-
sions [187,190]. Overall, no clear trend for NOx emissions compared
to diesel fuel for unchanged EGR rates can be stated from literature

data. However, emissions generally seem to remain in the same order
of magnitude.

Increasing exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a common way to
decrease engine-out NOx emissions. To achieve similar NOx levels with
OMEx-containing fuels as for fossil diesel fuel, EGR needs to be raised
slightly in most load points. However, the significant reduction in PM
emissions as discussed in Section 5.3, and the elimination of the soot-
NOx tradeoff for neat OMEx and high blend ratios of OMEx in diesel fuel
allow for a further significant increase of EGR rate, potentially even up
to a globally stoichiometric air-fuel ratio [24,152,176,182,187]. The
impact of different blend ratios on the range of possible EGR rates can
also be seen in Figs. 15 and 17, where the soot-NOx-tradeoff is shown
for different fuel blends with the strong increase of soot emissions
limiting the maximum EGR rate. Such increased EGR allows signifi-
cant reduction of engine-out NOx emissions due to lower combustion
temperatures, down to below 0.2 g∕kWh without aftertreatment, half of
the Euro VI level, for stoichiometric operation [152]. For neat OMEx
and high blend contents, the increase of EGR is only limited by the
drop in engine efficiency below λ = 1.1 [152], as discussed also in
Section 5.2. For higher EGR rates, the effect of chain length on NOx
emissions vanishes [190].

Some apparent discrepancy exists between the moderate increase of
NOx engine-out emissions measured in lab experiments, as discussed
above, and more pronounced increases of tail pipe emissions with
modern vehicles. In a Euro VI vehicle performing an RDE drive, a strong
increase of NOx emissions by 60 % for a blend of 30 vol% OME3−5 in
diesel fuel and up to 26 % for a blend of 15 vol% OME3−5 in diesel fuel
was detected [197]. In a Euro VI engine performing a WLTC test, an
increase of tailpipe NOx emissions by about 100 % was measured for a
blend of 30 vol% OME3−5 in diesel fuel [191]. A comparison between
engine-out and tailpipe emissions after aftertreatment with the fuel
blend relative to neat diesel fuel additionally revealed a much lower
relative increase in engine-out NOx emissions compared to tailpipe,
indicating non-proper function of the aftertreatment system with OMEx
in the fuel [191,197]. These stark increases can be attributed to the
non-adapted engine control in these particular cases though, leading
to operation in a perceived higher load point with less EGR due to
the lower heating value of OMEx, resulting in higher engine-out NOx
emissions as well as lower exhaust gas temperature [191,197,222].
The exhaust temperatures in turn might be too low for the oxidation
catalyst to convert NO to NO2 to be stored in the lean NOx trap of
the Euro VI vehicles. This would explain the discrepancy between the
relative increases of engine-out and tailpipe emissions [191,195]. In
fact, after optimization of the engine control map for a fuel blend
containing 15 vol% OME3−5 in diesel fuel to achieve the same engine-out
NOx emissions, also the tailpipe emissions dropped accordingly [223].
Similarly, also the efficiency of an active SCR is reduced with lower
exhaust gas temperatures when OMEx is burnt [200]. Despite that,
taking advantage of the increased EGR range, tail pipe NOx emissions
with neat OMEx and an advanced, twin-dosing SCR system under real
driving conditions could still be reduced to below 10 mg∕kWh, more
than an order below the Euro VI limit [200].

To achieve low tailpipe NOx emissions with OMEx in the fuel,
even for relatively low OMEx content, an adaptation of the engine
map and/or of the injector geometry to account for the lower heating
value of the fuel is inevitable, as shown above. This is a limitation for
OMEx as drop-in fuel, as a rough estimate of the content in the fuel
must be made available to the engine control at all times. Then again,
due to significantly lowered PM emissions as discussed in Section 5.3,
the upper limit for EGR increases significantly and extremely low
engine-out NOx emissions are thus achievable, potentially significantly
reducing aftertreatment efforts and cost.

5.5. Unburnt hydrocarbon emissions

5.6. CO emissions

Unburnt hydrocarbon (uHC) emissions from CI engines can be
attributed to three different main effects: Injector dripping; local over-
mixed, non-combustible lean regions; and local fuel-rich regions which
have insufficient time to mix and fully burn before the end of combus-
tion [202]. The combination of these three effects makes uHC emissions
very dependent on the engine design and operating conditions. Conse-
quently, no clear trend can be extracted from various literature data
regarding the impact of OMEx addition to diesel fuel. Some authors
report uHC emissions to continuously decrease with increasing OMEx
content in a blend [26,63,224] and for neat OMEx compared to fossil
diesel fuel [152,202]. Others found the exact opposite trend [181], or
even a decrease for small OMEx contents in diesel fuel and an increase
for neat OMEx [174]. The differences in trend can be attributed to the
different impact that OMEx properties have in different engines and
operating conditions. The oxygen content in the fuel should reduce uHC
emissions from locally rich regions, but might result in more overmixed
lean regions. The different volatility of different OMEx should also
impact mixture formation. Finally, the high cetane numbers of OMEx>2
lead to a faster and more complete burn-out, reducing uHC emissions,
while the low cetane number of OME1 likely has the opposite effect.
However, the cetane number impact seems to be low [63]. Overall
though, uHC emissions are well below current Euro VI legislation
thresholds for typical CI engine air-fuel-ratios. As expected, hydrocar-
bon emissions steeply rise when approaching fuel-rich conditions as for
all fuels [202].

Methane emissions make up a large fraction of total hydrocarbon
emissions [151], with this fraction barely changing with the fuel-air
equivalence ratio [202]. The reason in terms of reaction kinetics for
the large amount of methane formation are the methyl end-groups
in OMEx. Details are is discussed in Section 3.4. At lean conditions,
methane emissions are significantly lower with OMEx than with diesel
fuel [63]. But close to stoichiometric operation with OMEx, methane
emissions rise and are barely converted in a typical oxidation catalyst
due to the high required light-off temperature, leading to rising ex-
haust hydrocarbon emissions [24,151,152,176,177,202]. As methane
is a powerful GHG, this makes operating strategies near stoichiometric
conditions challenging.

Even though OMEx are produced from formaldehyde, formaldehyde
emissions are lower than for diesel fuel for most load points [24,63,
176]. At very low loads, formaldehyde emissions for neat OME3−5 are
about twice as high as for diesel fuel [63]. However these emissions
are expected to be fully converted in the oxidation catalyst, as has
also been demonstrated [177]. Yet, this was not the case with an
aged DOC in a Euro II passenger car, where a significant increase of
formaldehyde emissions was measured compared to diesel fuel even
after the DOC [174]. To avoid toxic and carcinogenic formaldehyde
emissions with OMEx, as for the operation with diesel fuel, an efficient
and up-to-date DOC is necessary.

Different relations between the OMEx chain length and methane as
well as formaldehyde emissions are reported. The source of such emis-
sions could be the methoxy chain elements and the methyl end groups
of OMEx, respectively, of which the ratio shifts with increasing chain
length. While methane emissions are independent of chain length [152,
177], formaldehyde emissions were reported to be significantly higher
for OME3−5 compared to OME1 in a particular load point [152], and
rising with longer chain lengths for OME2−5 in another engine with
medium load [187,190], but were reported to be similar for different
chain length in a different load point [177].

PAH emissions after DOC increase with a blend of OME3−5 in diesel
fuel compared to the base fuel, but it is assumed this is likely the result
of the measured decreased conversion efficiency of the DOC due to
lower exhaust gas temperatures in their operating conditions, not a
chemical fuel effect [175].

CO emissions are moderately to strongly reduced with OMEx com-
pared to conventional diesel fuel [26,63,144,152,188,198,202,224]. A
very strong reduction by more than 70 % was found for both OME1
and OME3−5 for a heavy duty single cylinder engine in one load
point [152]. In a stationary six-cylinder engine, a reduction by 35 %
and 65 % compared to diesel fuel was measured for 20 vol% and 50 vol%
OME2−6, respectively [198]. The reason for this is likely more complete
and faster combustion due to fuel oxygen, as discussed in Section 6.1,
leaving less partially oxidized fuel for the burn-out phase. The relative
impact of OMEx is higher for higher engine loads and high speeds,
where large fuel-rich regions are expected to exist and there is less
time for post-oxidation, such that the contribution of the oxygen in
the fuel to the full oxidation is high [181,225]. The opposite happens
with particularly high OME1 contents at low load points, where the
long ignition delay leads to more non-reactive mixing, which promotes
regions too lean to fully burn, finally resulting in CO emissions [26].

Approaching stoichiometric conditions, CO emissions rise very sig-
nificantly, even up to the point where engine efficiency is signifi-
cantly affected [202]. In all cases and down to almost stoichiometric
conditions, CO is oxidized very effectively in the DOC [24,151,176].

5.7. Future research perspectives

On the fundamental level, tremendous progress has been made
over the recent years in understanding the soot reduction potential
of oxygenated fuels in general and OMEx in particular. Still, the ex-
act importance of the different impact factors is a topic of ongoing
research. A combination of recently developed detailed kinetic reac-
tion mechanisms for OMEx with state-of-the-art soot nucleation and
oxidation models under engine-relevant conditions should result in
higher completeness of data unachievable by experiments, allowing to
significantly improve understanding of the impact of OMEx on soot
formation and oxidation. At the same time, more high-fidelity exper-
imental data would help to validate and improve the aforementioned
kinetic models, in particular regarding PAH formation rates. Another
open research topic is the reduction of PM particle sizes with OMEx.
Some studies have hinted that these particles might not originate
from combustion soot formation, but, e.g., engine oil and erosion,
and investigation of the interaction of such small particles with soot
nuclei and soot precursors (or the lack thereof) could lead to interesting
insights about why these small particle sizes are less present in case of
fossil diesel. However, experiments in OMEx-doped burner-stabilized
ethylene flames have shown no significant reduction in nano-particle
formation, while formation of larger soot particles was heavily sup-
pressed with OMEx addition as expected [226]. Further research under
engine-relevant conditions is required to improve the understanding
of the formation of the smallest particles in OMEx combustion. As
discussed above, if the fuel or fuel blend used in vehicle operation is not
known beforehand, fuel sensors to distinguish between different OMEx
blend ratios are required to allow for flexible operation depending on
future OMEx availability. Typical measurement methods based on the
permittivity, as used for ethanol-gasoline-blends, are not as suitable for
OMEx blends, as the dielectric constants of OMEx and diesel fuel are
much closer to each other. Closed-loop control via exhaust gas sensors
might be possible, but this will require further testing.

On the engine application side, OMEx allow for novel combinations
of operating and aftertreatment strategies which are not possible with
fossil diesel. Optimization of the full parameter range of possible fuel
blends, different engine operating modes and aftertreatment systems
regarding engine performance, emissions, costs and climate impact
is an incredibly challenging research task. As some existing studies
already showed, significant potential could likely still be leveraged here
by deviating further from existing well-known diesel-fueled CI engine
approaches. Additionally, most research on state-of-the-art engines was

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10117324

H. Pitsch et al.

performed with light vehicles engines. However current trends hint at
the fact that application of e-fuels such as OMEx would be more likely
in heavy-duty applications. Gathering field data with state-of-the-art
heavy duty engines, e.g., in trucks, could be helpful to highlight the
potential of OMEx also for these applications.

6. Production costs, efficiency, and market perspectives

The reduction of GHG to reduce global warming becomes even
more complex and challenging if economic and social boundary con-
ditions need to be considered. This chapter focuses on the different
aspects of the market potential of oxymethylene ethers. Production
efficiencies are discussed in Section 6.1. Production cost estimates from
literature for various pathways are presented and compared to other
fuel candidates in Section 6.2, followed by a discussion on fuel life
cycle assessments from well to wheel in Section 6.3, highlighting under
which conditions OMEx-based fuels can deliver a net climate benefit.
This section closes with a high-level view on policies and market
introduction in Section 6.4.

6.1. Production efficiency

As long as the amount of renewable power available for e-fuel
production is considered a limiting factor, any increase in production
efficiency of a fuel directly relates to a global warming reduction. All
e-fuels share the first steps of electrolysis to produce H2 and, except
for carbon-free fuels such as H2 itself or ammonia, CO2 capture from
air or point sources. Thus, these steps will not be covered in this
section to avoid introducing more assumptions and scenarios than
necessary. The subsequent chemical processes, on the other hand, show
some significant differences, and for OMEx in particular, the choice
of production pathway from the wide range discussed above has a
significant impact on the overall production efficiency.

In this review, we will give production energy efficiencies collected
from literature based on H2 and CO2 as reactants and using the reactant
and product lower heating values LHVi per kg of OMEx product

η =

LHVOMEx

.

(30)

+ ̇qin + ̇wel − LHVside

̇qin is the net heat demand of production and ̇wel

LHVH2
Additionally,
is
the electrical power demand of production, each for 1 kg of OMEx
product. Other authors have denoted such efficiency as plant efficiency
or process efficiency. If no comparable efficiency was given in the
original work, we have recomputed it based on the published numbers
in the original paper and supplemental material. Fig. 19 makes an
attempt to visualize the broad range of production efficiencies which
have been reported. For comparison, some other prominent e-fuels
are also included. Table 3 serves as extended legend for Fig. 19. For
each fuel production model, Fig. 19 gives two key values: first, the
corresponding energy efficiency calculated as discussed above (lowest
bar), and second, a theoretical maximum value based on stoichiometry,
i.e., based on a process with no external energy demand and no unde-
sired side product formation (top of the stacked bars). This simplifies
Eq. (30) to:

ηth,max =

LHVOMEx
LHVH2

.

(31)

In addition, the difference between the theoretical efficiency and the
practical process efficiency is split into contributions due to undesired
side product formation (necessitating additional H2 input), electrical
energy demand, and heat demand. This allows to both investigate
differences between different production pathways and fuels, as well
as differences between different literature sources for the same fuel
production pathway.

It should be noted that an energy-efficiency based comparison as
given here based on literature data inherently assumes an equal value

of all different energy inputs. Strong arguments can be made against
this assumption. E.g., if hydrogen is produced from electrolysis with an
efficiency of 80 %, hydrogen energy input should be multiplied by 1.25.
Similarly, heat can often be provided using lower exergy sources such
as waste heat, while the analysis presented here inherently assumes
utilization of electrical power for heating at 100 % efficiency. An exergy-
based assessment, as for example done by Burre et al. [56], alleviates
this problem, however assigning exergies to educt, product, and heat
streams can be challenging. As most literature sources compute energy-
based production efficiencies, we will stick to the same metric here
despite the shortcomings outlined above.

Focussing on the theoretical maximum efficiencies first, it can be
clearly seen that OME3−5 produced using the established or the an-
hydrous pathways (P6-P18), which both rely on partial oxidation of
methanol to produce the required formaldehyde, shows clearly inferior
values compared to all shown exemplary e-fuel competitors (P22-
P24). OME1, on the other hand, is already competitive even using
the established or oxidative pathways (P1-P3) due to the more fa-
vorable ratio of methanol to formaldehyde. In contrast, using new,
reductive or dehydrogenation routes, the theoretical maximum effi-
ciency of production for both OME1 (P4-P5) and OME3−5 (P19-P21)
exceed obtainable values for FT-diesel (P22) and methanol (P23) sig-
nificantly. This surprising result stems from the stoichiometric 100 %
hydrogen conversion efficiency of the dehydrogenative or reductive
formaldehyde production from methanol, if the hydrogen byproduct is
rerouted back to methanol production. The resulting very high overall
conversion of hydrogen heating value to fuel heating value leads to a
very high achievable efficiency showcasing the theoretical potential of
OMEx fuels also from a production efficiency point of view.

However, now comparing the currently achievable production effi-
ciencies modeled by the various literature sources, it is also obvious
that for all OMEx pathways (P1-P21) there are significantly larger
gaps to the theoretical values compared to the reference e-fuels (P22-
P24). The two main contributors to this difference are side product
formation and external heat demand, with electricity demand, mostly
for compression, playing a minor role. More surprisingly, at first glance,
the established production routes actually outperform the theoretically
favored reductive and dehydrogenation routes. The reasons for this and
other findings for different pathways will be discussed in more detail
in the following.

For OME1, the two predictions for the established, aqueous pathway
by Burre et al. [56] (P1) and Schemme et al. [4] (P2) agree well, both
in terms of resulting efficiency as well as heat demand and loss due to
side product formation. The efficiency of the oxidative pathway (P3) is
slightly higher, mainly because side product formation is significantly
reduced due to the one-pot reaction, however the electricity demand
goes up due to a refrigeration machine being used in the underlying
study for product separation [56]. The efficiency of the reductive and
dehydrogenation pathways (P4-P5) drops off significantly compared
to the former two, mainly because of an enormous heat demand for
product separation due to low product yields [56]. For both pathways,
equilibrium product yields would reduce heat demand by more than
80 %, putting them significantly ahead of the established pathway
(P1-P2) [56]. Further catalyst development as well as in-situ H2 re-
moval in case of the dehydrogenation pathway could help close this
gap [56]. Additionally, side products of the dehydrogenation pathway
(P5) are valuable (MF and DME), and accrediting them as product
closes part of the gap to the reductive pathway (P4). Note that in their
work, Burre et al. [56] computed exergy efficiencies instead of energy
efficiencies and accredited side products, putting the reductive and
dehydrogenation pathways (P4-P5) ahead of the aqueous and oxidative
pathways (P1-P3) despite the high heat demand due to the relatively
low temperatures of the required heat supply.

Regarding the established, aqueous production pathway for OME3−5
(P6-P10), the stark differences between the different predicted efficien-
cies are immediately recognizable. The results by Voelker et al. [227]

(P9) are based on the same model as the results by Held et al. [3]
(P8), so these two agree well, but differ heavily from the other two
results. This has two underlying reasons: first, these process models
predict significantly less H2 consumption per unit mass fuel produced,
which means less side products leave the production chain. A major
contributor here is the assumption of perfect separation of water in the
evaporators utilized to increase the formaldehyde concentration prior
to the OME3−5 synthesis, while, e.g., in the work of Mantei et al. [5]
(P10), a considerable amount of formaldehyde is lost through the
waste water stream. Second, there are significant differences in net heat
demand. In theory, efficiency values for (P6, P8-P10) are based on
full heat integration throughout the entire production chain, but the
calculations differ both in the heat demand of the individual sub steps
as well as the level of detail of the heat integration modeling. With
an idealized pinch heat integration throughout the entire production
chain, Voelker et al. [227] (P9) and Held et al. [3] (P8) find a net heat
demand of almost zero. If heat integration is only considered within
each separate step of methanol production, formaldehyde production,
and finally OME3−5 synthesis, the overall heat demand increases signif-
icantly, and the production efficiency drops by more than 6 % as shown

by the corresponding results by Held et al. [3] (P7). With a more real-
istic heat integration concept with actually modeled heat exchangers,
again throughout the entire production chain though, Mantei et al. [5]
(P10) find a moderate net heat demand. On the other hand, Schemme
et al. [4] (P6) first of all assume a significantly higher heat demand
for the last production step, and on top of that utilize a heat supply
on three discrete pressure levels. This limits integration between the
sub-processes, resulting in a much higher total net heat demand on a
high pressure level and an unused surplus of steam on lower pressure
levels.

For the anhydrous OME3−5 production pathways (P11-P18), pre-
dicted production efficiencies drop by a few percentage points. This
is mostly due to the significant heat demand of trioxane production,
which can only be partially covered by heat integration of surplus heat
from the preceding methanol and formaldehyde production steps, and
the significantly reduced heat demand of the final OME3−5 synthesis
compared to the aqueous pathway (P6-P10) discussed above. Addition-
ally, production from DME (P17-P18) instead of OME1 (P11-P16) as
intermediate is disadvantageous from an energy efficiency perspective,

as more energetically costly trioxane is needed. While most of the
modeled efficiencies agree well, the results by Held et al. [3] (P15)
are an outlier. Their calculated heat demand for trioxane production
before heat integration with other processes is less than half of what all
other studies find, which is surprising because they consider the same
distillation-based trioxane production process [229] as all other studies,
and the significantly higher energy demand of the latter agrees with the
calculations in the original work [230]. Consequently, the results by
Held et al. [3] (P15) for the anhydrous pathway should be considered
an outlier, and thus overall this pathway is significantly behind all
other OMEx pathways (P1-P10, P19-P21) as well as all other reference
e-fuels considered in Fig. 19 (P22-P24) in terms of efficiency.

From a stoichiometry point of view, the dehydrogenation method
for OME3−5 production (P19-P21) should deliver promising results as
indicated by the very high theoretical maximum efficiency. This is,
again, due to the non-oxidative formaldehyde production which allows
to recycle the freed hydrogen. This theoretical potential is, however,
not fully leveraged yet with currently existing processes, and the prac-
tical efficiencies using similar model assumptions are on a similar
level ((P21) to (P9)) only or slightly higher ((P20) to (P10)) than the
efficiencies of the aqueous pathway. While the H2 demands of Voelker
et al. [227] (P21) and Mantei et al. [5] (P20) seem similar at first
glance, this is just the case because two different modeling assumptions
cancel each other out. Mantei et al. [5] (P20) predict significantly
more CO side product formation in the formaldehyde synthesis, but
on the other hand assume perfect separation and recycling of H2,
ending up with a similar net H2 demand as Voelker et al. [227] (P21).
Ouda et al. [61] (P19) on the other hand aim to achieve an even
lower formation of CO, and in this case we apply the assumption of
perfect recycling (as their analysis is limited to the reactant methanol)
to end up with the numbers presented in Fig. 19. In terms of heat
demand, direct comparison is difficult as again different levels of detail

in modeling are applied, and in particular different methods are utilized
for transporting the produced FA to the OME3−5 reactor, resulting in
different heat demands for separation. Voelker et al. [227] (P21) use an
aqueous reaction environment for the OME3−5 production step similar
to the established, aqueous pathway (P6-10), and can thus utilize water
to selectively purge formaldehyde and methanol from the formaldehyde
reactor product gas. Ouda et al. [61] (P19) and Mantei et al. [5] (P20)
on the other hand use a dry process with nitrogen as carrier gas. When
comparing the numbers given in Fig. 19 with the original sources, note
that Ouda et al. [61] give efficiencies based on methanol as reactant,
not CO2 and H2, and declare the recovered H2 as product instead of
recycling it to reduce the H2 educt demand in the denominator. Both
together lead to significantly, but somewhat misleadingly, higher stated
efficiencies in their work.

From this review and discussion of literature studies for OMEx

production efficiencies, the following key take-aways can be stated:

1. On a theoretical level based on stoichiometry, OMEx is more
than competitive with other e-fuels if the more advanced pro-
duction pathways avoiding partial oxidation of methanol for
formaldehyde production are used.

2. Practical efficiencies with currently existing processes for OMEx
production are significantly behind competing e-fuels, necessi-
tating further improvements and research.

3. The latter is particularly true for the advanced processes men-
tioned in point 1, which are currently even lagging behind
the more established, aqueous pathways in terms of achievable
efficiencies.

4. Heat integration throughout the entire process chain allows for
substantial energy demand reduction. The level of detail used
in modeling heat integration significantly impacts the predicted
overall efficiencies.

Table 4.

6.2. Production costs

Cost competitiveness with other propulsion technologies will likely
be a major factor in the discussion to introduce an e-fuel such as
OMEx into the market. Fig. 20 summarizes production cost predictions
from literature per liter diesel equivalent (i.e., on an energy basis),
broken down into costs for the reactants H2 and CO2 (or methanol in
cases where the production chain starts with methanol, or biomass),
operational expenses (e.g., heat, electricity), and capital expenses. For
comparison, also an EU-average price for fossil diesel with and without
taxes, online procurement prices for grey OME1 as well as production
cost predictions for some select other e-fuels are shown. It should be
noted that the prices given for diesel (C24-C25) and the price for grey
OME1 (C1) include an unknown profit margin and, in case of diesel
fuel, also shipping and distribution costs, and can therefore not be
directly compared to the production costs for the different e-fuels. An
extended legend is given in Table 4.

Clearly, for all e-fuels (C2-C8, C12, C14, C16, C18-C23), the costs
for H2 and CO2 procurement are the major drivers of total product
cost. In the studies shown here, assumed baseline prices for green H2

vary from 4121 to 5000 e∕t. All studies except Mantei et al. [5] (C8,
C19), who assume 309 e∕t for CO2, use a point source CO2 price of
70 e∕t. Two original works by Schmitz et al. [64] (C13) and Ouda
et al. [61] (C17) calculate OME3−5 costs based on grey methanol, using
prices of 285 and 336 e∕t, respectively. For these two cases, Fig. 20 also
additionally presents recomputed values (C14, C18) based on the green
methanol production cost assessment by Schemme et al. [4] (C22).
This corresponds to a green methanol price of 1078 e∕t, which is also
in the middle of the range between 608 and 1453 e∕t given by Hank
et al. [235]. In case of the dehydrogenation process (C18-C20), the H2
product stream was used to reduce the H2 demand. For the production
pathways based on biomass (C11, C15), the raw product costs are
significantly lower. However, the process costs increase due to the
additional steps of syngas production from biomass. Capital expenses
are generally low in comparison to the other expenses.

The price given for grey OME1 (C1) corresponds to online-available
prices for OME1 from China. Interestingly, such fuel could currently
be cheaper than fossil diesel (C24-C25) if it was taxed less. The same
is also true for OME3−5 based on grey methanol (C9,C13). However,
the climate impact of such fuels would likely be net negative (see

Section 6.3). Any e-fuel produced using green hydrogen is significantly
more expensive than fossil diesel fuel as of now.

For OME1, it can be seen that production based on the reductive
route (C5) can be competitive with other e-fuels such as Fischer–
Tropsch-diesel (C21) or DME (C23), with total fuel prices in the range
of 2 e per liter diesel equivalent. Here, the reduced hydrogen consump-
tion of this production pathway, as discussed in the previous sections,
comes into full effect. Despite a significantly worse energy efficiency,
production costs are significantly lower compared to the established,
aqueous pathway (C2-C3) and the oxidative pathway (C4). For the
aqueous pathway, production price predictions by Burre et al. [56] (C2)
and Schemme et al. [4] (C3) agree well at a price of about 2.5 e per
liter diesel equivalent. However, note that this is only because a higher
assumed price of hydrogen by the former roughly compensates the
higher predicted heat demands and thus higher operational expenses
by the latter.

As expected, production of green OME3−5 (C7-C8,C10,C12, C14,
C16, C17-C20) is generally more expensive per liter diesel equivalent
with a price range between 3 and 4 e per liter diesel equivalent. For
the aqueous production pathway, the significant difference between
the predictions by Schemme et al. [4] (C7) and Mantei et al. [5]
(C8) are mostly based on the vastly different assumed CO2 price. The
calculations by Tönges et al. [232] (C9) for the aqueous pathway
are based on grey methanol at 401 e∕t, and went into significant
detail regarding the underlying plant process model. Different water
separation and formaldehyde production pathways lead to a relatively
low overall spread of the production costs of around ±10% around
the mean [232]. It should be pointed out that their resulting prices
would be competitive with diesel fuel in the EU as of today. Utilizing
the methanol production calculations by Schemme et al. [4] for green
methanol instead, the resulting overall price is still low. The assumed
carbon yield is comparatively high, resulting in relatively low raw
material costs, and a significant amount of excess steam is assumed
to be sold to other processes, resulting in low net operating costs.
With an adjusted carbon yield and without selling excess steam, their
results move into the range of Schemme et al. [4] (C7). Interestingly,
production based on biomass from Mahbub et al. [233] (C11) ends up
in the same price range as the three previously discussed renewable
production routes, indicating that production of syngas from biomass
is roughly as expensive as production via electrolysis and CO2 point

capture. For the anhydrous pathways via trioxane, production costs
predicted by Schemme et al. [4] (C12, C16) are slightly higher due
to the higher heat demand as well as higher capital expenses for
trioxane production. However, the calculation by Schmitz et al. [64]
(C14), extended with the methanol production by Schemme et al. [4],
predicts notably lower costs. This is for two reasons: First, the assumed
conversion rates from methanol to OMEx product of Schmitz et al. [64]
(C14) are notably higher, in particular in the formaldehyde production
step, leading to lower H2 and CO2 procurement costs. Second, and
even more importantly, Schmitz et al. [64] (C14) do not calculate
the heat demand for the trioxane production step, but instead assume
similar heat demand to the OME1 plant. As discussed in Section 6.1
above, this is not a very good approximation, as the heat demand for
trioxane formation is significantly higher, and thus Schmitz et al. [64]
(C14) likely underestimate the total heat demand of the entire pro-
duction chain significantly despite no assumed heat integration. The
most notable outlier of the entire field though is the cost estimate by
Damyanov et al. [48] (C15) for production from full tree biomass.
Their operational expenses are extremely low, despite using the energy-
intensive process via trioxane, in comparison with Mahbub et al. [233]
(C11) who estimate very significant costs for syngas production from
biomass. Consequently, the results by Damyanov are questionable.

The dehydrogenation OME3−5 pathway (C17-C20) shows its poten-
tial compared to the other pathways in the cost analysis. The signifi-
cantly reduced hydrogen demand directly leads to significant overall
cost reductions. Again, the values given in the original work by Mantei
et al. [5] (C19) are based on very high CO2 costs from DAC. For better
comparison, their assessment was recomputed (C20) using the H2 and
CO2 costs for a point source from Schemme et al. [4] (C22), the same
that were also used for the recalculated green production assessment
from Ouda et al. [61] (C18). Both recalculated values end up at around
3 e per liter diesel equivalent, which is about 15 % cheaper on average
compared to the aqueous pathway. (C20) with CO2 from a point
source is more than 20 % cheaper than (C19) based on DAC, despite
slightly higher H2 costs, showing the significant additional costs of DAC
compared to a point source. The remaining difference between (C18)
and (C20) can be mostly attributed to much higher conversion rates
for Ouda et al. [61] (C17-C18), as already discussed in Section 6.1. In
their work, Ouda et al. [61] also gave significantly lower production
costs with a recalculated value around 1.05 e per liter diesel equivalent

for their assessment based on grey methanol if the plant capacity is
increased from 35 to 1000 kt∕a, as, e.g., used by Schmitz et al. [64]
(C13-C14). But, as they do not give further details on the break-down
of this price, it was not included in Fig. 20.

As mentioned above, shipping, marketing, and distribution costs as
well as profit margins need to be added to the e-fuel production prices
given above. In general, ship transport costs are almost negligible for
liquid fuels, as for example shown for a hypothetical e-fuel production
in Tunisia and subsequent shipping to Europe [236]. This makes the
overall e-fuel production location relatively independent of its final
destination, underlining the large advantage compared to gaseous fuels
and electrical power. Distribution costs and retail margins are typically
not public information. Numbers for petrol fuel published by the Aus-
tralian government might give an indication for other markets as well
though: they declared local wholesale costs plus retail margin to have
been around 26 % compared to the overall fuel price before taxes in
2019 [237].

Overall, to summarize:

1. OMEx production from grey methanol is cost-competitive with
fossil diesel if tax incentives are given (note that distribution
costs and profit margin need to be added to the e-fuel prices for
comparison with the given diesel fuel numbers).

2. For green OMEx, costs are mainly driven by H2 (making up

between around 60 % and 80 % of total cost).

3. CO2 price impact on total fuel cost is comparably small for CO2
from a point source, but can become a relevant cost factor for
DAC.

4. Operational costs (mostly heat and electricity demand) differ
significantly from pathway to pathway and can play a deciding
factor, as they are generally higher for OMEx than for other e-
fuels. The latter is due to production steps involving significant
heat and/or compression demand.

5. Capital costs are overall low compared to operational expenses.
6. Pathways with reduced hydrogen consumption might not yet
fully live up to their potential in terms of energy efficiency,
as discussed in Section 6.1, but they already show promising
cost advantages. Despite that, the higher TRL of the aqueous
pathways might give them the overall edge for any near-term
large-scale production plant development.

7. With current technology, production costs for OMEx span be-
tween 2 and 4 e per liter diesel equivalent. The difference of
OME3−5 in particular to other e-fuels such as Fischer–Tropsch-
diesel and DME needs to be compensated by their comparably
advantageous fuel properties. These fuel properties and their
impacts are discussed in Sections 4 and 5.

6.3. Life-cycle assessments

Determining the total life-cycle impact of a fuel is challenging, in
particular, when very different propulsion systems are compared be-
cause in that case, vehicle production and end-of-life emissions need to
be considered as well. The comparison of OMEx with other propulsion
systems such as BEV is therefore omitted here, and the focus lies on a
well-to-wheel comparison with the baseline of fossil diesel fuel.

Fig. 21 shows GW impact in gram CO2 −eq. per kilometer driven for
a CI-engine vehicle with a reference emission of 209 g∕km under diesel
operation taken from Hank et al. [238]. Table 5 gives more details
about the data in Fig. 21. All data from different literature sources has
been recalculated to gram CO2 −eq per kilometer driven using the same
vehicle as Hank et al. [238] for better comparability. All bars start in
the negative due to credited CO2 utilization, either from air or from a
point source. This CO2 is released again either as purge stream during
production or during fuel combustion. Thus, the brown parts of the bars
represent the tank-to-wheel emissions, while the other three parts com-
bined make up the well-to-tank emissions. A relative decrease of fuel

consumption by 2 % with neat OMEx due to increased engine efficiency
is assumed following the original work, otherwise fuel consumption
was converted using the fuel’s lower heating values. The CO2 tailpipe
emissions are slightly higher with OME3−5 and slightly lower for OME1
in comparison with diesel fuel due to the fuel’s molecular composition
in combination with the lower heating values.

Scenarios (L2-L4, L6-L11) assume fully renewable provision of elec-
trical power (mainly for electrolysis), representing a desirable best-case
production setup. If CO2 is provided by a point source (L2-L4, L6, L8,
L9-L11) or direct air capture (DAC) with a low carbon footprint (L7),
then neat OMEx allows for significant well-to-wheel global warming po-
tential reductions, ranging from −78 % to −95 % compared to the fossil
diesel reference depending on the scenario and production pathway. In
these scenarios, the GW impact due to hydrogen production is roughly
of the same order as the GW impact of the subsequent liquid fuel
production, which includes side product combustion and heat as well as
electricity demands. The choice of production pathway does not make
a significant difference in terms of carbon footprint, see (L2-L3) and
(L4, L6). If H2 and CO2 are provided almost burden-free, the reduced
demand in case of the reductive pathway makes less of a difference in
GW impact. However, the impact on cost can be significant, as shown
in Section 6.2. For all scenarios discussed above, the assumptions in
the original works regarding the GW impact of the supplied renewable
electricity is responsible for the majority of the differences.

Production from biomass (L5) ends up in the same ball park as
production as e-fuel using fully renewable power with a GW impact
reduction of −85 % for the scenario based on forest residue [233] shown
here. In this case, the H2 bar corresponds to provision of biomass,
and it was assumed that all CO2 released during combustion of the
resulting fuel was previously extracted from air by the trees. Together
with the results from Section 6.2, this once again underlines the similar
potential of biomass-based production, which could supplement e-fuel
production to increase the amount of available fuel.

Scenarios (L9-L10) show the GW impact of a blend of 35 vol% OME1
in diesel fuel [239]. Such blend composition was chosen because it
gives a very good compromise between heating value of the fuel and
soot reduction [26]. With such a blend, a GW impact reduction of 28 %
can be achieved, while at the same time significantly reducing soot as
well as nitric oxide emissions. This value is lower than the volumetric
OME1 content mostly due to the reduced LHV of OME1 compared to
diesel fuel, i.e., OME1 only contributes around 25 % of the total LHV of
the fuel blend. With OME3−5 and the same blending ratio, a similar GW
impact reduction can be achieved (L11) [227]. Note that the original
work by Deutz et al. [239] showed a slightly lower potential GW impact
reduction due to a lower assumed carbon footprint of diesel production
compared to the values used in this work from Hank et al. [238].

Finally, scenarios (L12-L14) were included to showcase how e-fuel
production consists of a chain of sub-processes, all of which have to be
based on dominantly renewable power supply to deliver a reasonable
net carbon footprint reduction compared to the reference of fossil
diesel. In particular, even relatively small fractions of non-renewable
power in the electricity mix have a massive impact. Mantei et al. [5]
(L12-L13) use a German grid mix from 2018 and Hank et al. [238]
(L14) add a further 40 % fully renewable power to such a grid mix,
resulting in about 500 g∕kWh and 350 g∕kWh GW impact burden, re-
spectively. It is immediately obvious how such produced fuel would still
be significantly worse in terms of GW impact compared to fossil diesel
fuel. In fact, for a high carbon footprint of the available electricity,
production of OMEx based on fossil pathways, i.e., grey methanol,
becomes favorable compared to e-fuel production based on electrolysis.
However, such fuel is also still significantly worse in terms of GW
impact than fossil diesel (around 350 g∕km), so that grey methanol-
based production would only make sense on a very short time scale to
ramp up industrial production already while green hydrogen supply is
still low. The break point for electricity carbon footprint from which
e-fuel OMEx would deliver a net climate benefit compared to fossil

diesel on a well-to-wheel assessment is at around 90–140 g∕kWh for
OME3−5 [5,227,238] and around 120–200 g∕kWh for OME1 [56,239].

If DAC is used for CO2 provision and heat demand is covered by
natural gas (L14) instead of fully renewable power (L8), well-to-wheel
GW impact rises by 114 g CO2,eq∕km [238]. For the synthesis steps,
covering the heat demand by natural gas increases GW impact by
104 g CO2,eq∕km compared to an electricity-based heat supply based on
a dominantly renewable grid [238]. The sum of these two contributions
would exceed current well-to-wheel emissions of fossil diesel, empha-
sizing that utilization of green hydrogen alone does not automatically
lead to a green fuel.

Finally, as production of large quantities of e-fuels will likely be
concentrated in regions with high renewable power potential, transport

of e-fuels to the final customer over long distances might be required.
For example, supply of Central Europe with e-fuels from the Middle East
and North Africa region would result in additional shipping emissions
not included in the assessments above. However, energy consumption
for shipping liquid fuels, and thus also corresponding CO2 emissions,
are almost negligible in comparison to the fuel’s heating value [240].

6.4. Policies and market introduction

Technological solutions for defossilization in transport, heating,
cooking, and industrial applications also need to take energy availabil-
ity, cost, and infrastructure into account, which might require different
measures in order to accelerate the transition to CO2 neutrality. Recent

studies for transport applications [241–243] have shown that low
carbon fuels are key for defossilizing the fleet of vehicles in service
(currently around 1.3 billion globally), which are dominating the CO2-
emissions in transport. Those vehicles, which typically have a lifetime
of 15–20 years, will still emit CO2 for a long time even if the sale
of ICE-powered vehicles would be stopped immediately. As a recent
study [243] has shown, the rate of defossilization on the basis of
life-cycle-GHG emissions is a function of how quickly CO2-neutral
powertrain solutions can be introduced into the transport sector. This
exemplary study focused on the European transport sector, where
the results were derived mostly from German references. Regional
differences in Europe were not examined. Fig. 22 shows the share
of carbon-neutral vehicles in the European fleet, taking into account
the rate of introduction of carbon-neutral powertrain technologies and
energy sources. In 2020, essentially all vehicles were powered by
fossil-based products that need to be replaced, as these vehicles will
remain on the road for some time. It can be seen that methanol-based
fuels like MtG (Methanol-to-Gasoline) have the potential to reduce
CO2-emissions significantly earlier than electrified solutions, since they
would already have an effect in the existing vehicle fleet. For diesel
applications, methanol-based fuels like DME or OMEx had not been
considered. However, it can be assumed that they would also support
a faster rate of defossilization in transport and beyond.

As already indicated, the speed of bringing CO2-neutral fuels to the
market has to be increased in order to achieve carbon neutrality early
while electrified solutions just slowly penetrate the vehicle stock. How-
ever, in order to accelerate fuel-production and market introduction,
the regulatory boundary conditions, standards, and policies need to be
in place in order to guarantee investment security. On a high level, e-
fuels have the significant advantage of comparably cheap and simple
energy storage and transport compared to electricity. Current energy-
importing countries will likely still import energy also in the long term,
e.g., for Germany, imports of around 25 % of the total energy demand
are still expected in a fully climate neutral scenario in 2045 [244].
For central Europe, import of hydrogen or synthetic fuels from MENA
(Middle East and North Africa) or other regions with significant re-
sources of renewable energy is a likely and possible solution to close
the gap between energy demand and domestic production, even though
cost competitiveness with local production relies on relatively cheap
transport [245]. Allocation of the imported chemical energy carriers to
the different applications in industry and transportation, in competition
with direct electrification using domestic renewable power, will be a
challenging task, and e-fuels such as OMEx can potentially make very

important contributions both for the existing fleet and new vehicles.
Introducing new fuels like OMEx can be quite challenging, and many
other promising fuels never made it to the market. Existing standards
for Diesel-like fuels (i.e., EN590 in Europe for Diesel) do not comply
with new fuels such as neat OMEx. This is particularly true for the
volatile OME1. Therefore, new fuel standards have to be developed,
which usually is very time consuming. For DME and OMEx, technical
specifications have been developed globally in recent years. But before
those fuels can be sold or used in new vehicles, they have to be included
in relevant regulations so that they can become legal products in the
relevant regions. In Europe, for example, they would need to be part
of the RED (renewable energy directive), the AFID (alternative fuels
infrastructure directive), the CVD (clean vehicles directive) and they
have to be included in the type approval for vehicles. These processes
are very complex and require a good understanding of the relevant
steps. An overview of the complex regulation network, which needs
to be considered, was discussed by Grüniger et al. [246]. The major
roadblock, however, for opening up the renewable fuel market are the
CO2 regulations, which are mostly tank-to-wheel-based, meaning that
the vehicle-CO2 emissions themselves need to be reduced independent
of how the energy carrier was produced (fossil or renewable). Although
it has been well accepted that sustainable fuels are required for de-
fossilizing the transport sector, fuel producers are hesitating to invest
because their perspective of having a profitable business when CO2-
reduction from renewable fuels is not counted is very poor. In recent
years, crediting mechanisms have been discussed allowing the car man-
ufacturers to subsidize renewable fuel production [247]. However, the
European commission stated that such a system would counteract the
CO2-saving measures and create a significant administrative overhead,
and thereby did not recommend to adopt these proposed amendments
to the standards. Recently, discussions in European authorities, who
originally had decided to phase out ICE-powered cars beyond 2035 by
restricting the Tank-to-Wheel-CO2-Output, have started to allow ICE-
powered vehicles beyond 2035 if they are fueled by carbon-neutral
RFNBO (renewable fuels of non-biological origin) fuels. Consultations
on how those RFNBOs are defined and what a technical implementation
could look like are ongoing. Synthetic fuels like renewable OMEx, DME,
or methanol would be ideal candidates for those applications and could
play a major role.

On the commercial vehicle side, the phase-out of conventional
diesel engines will likely be significantly later with, e.g., an alliance
of truck makers consisting of Daimler, Scania, MAN, Volvo, DAF,
Iveco and Ford, announcing a target of 2040 for fossil-free commercial

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10117332

trucks [248]. Full electrification of these vehicles will remain chal-
lenging, and both hydrogen and renewable fuels will likely play a
role [249]. This includes a chance for OMEx≥2, potentially both as blend
component in conventional diesel fuel to already reduce pollutant and
CO2 emissions on the road to 2040, and as a neat fuel for long-range
commercial CI engines from 2040 onwards. As the introduction of pure
electrification for heavy-duty vehicles is more challenging, synthetic
fuel solutions are a very reasonable option, especially for long-haul
applications. This is currently being discussed in the political debate on
future CO2 regulations for heavy-duty vehicles, for example in Europe.
Other potential markets for OMEx include stationary diesel engines,
e.g., for backup power production, and ship engines. In particular for
the latter, solutions to decarbonization are further away from market
readiness, and considering the long service time of most vessels, a retro-
fit of an existing engine during a scheduled major overhaul might be
an attractive option. Again, a seamless transition between fossil and
green fuel is possible, and significant pollutant emission reduction can
be achieved on the way.

7. Conclusions

Only few e-fuels have acquired as much research attention as
oxymethylene ethers, and this review attempts to provide a thorough,
compact and consolidated overview and assessment of recent research
progress in all steps along the life cycle of OMEx, ranging from produc-
tion to application. Also possible future research directions have been
provided at the end of each of the major sections of this review.

In Section 2, the various production pathways and their individual
advantages in terms of production efficiencies and costs were discussed.
In particular, the life cycle assessments summarized and compared
in Section 6.3 showed first that OMEx have significant potential to
reduce the climate impact of road transport, if produced under the right
circumstances, i.e., using predominantly renewable energy, and second
that it is also competitive to other e-fuels if advanced, more efficient
production pathways are utilized. This underlined the necessity to focus
research on these production pathways, and quickly bring them to
higher technology readiness levels for large scale production. Section 3
showed that, over the recent years, tremendous progress was made in
understanding the combustion reaction kinetics of OMEx, allowing for
high-fidelity simulations necessary to further our understanding of the
combustion processes. However, a lack of reduced but still accurate
kinetic mechanisms for OMEx and blends of it with, e.g., fossil diesel
is currently limiting the possibilities for CFD-based parameter studies
to optimize engine geometries and controls for full utilization of the
potential of OMEx. The challenges for engine combustion associated
with the fuel properties of OMEx were discussed in Section 4. Particular
attention was also paid to the material compatibility, which remains
a challenge for retrofitting existing engines to be compatible with
OMEx fuels, also showcasing that appropriate materials for sealing
and tubing exist. Finally, in Section 5, the vast amount of literature
data regarding engine performance and emissions was reviewed and
compared in an attempt to both highlight the potential of OMEx as well
as to investigate which changes to engines must or should be made
to utilize this potential. Additionally, especially the super-linear soot
reduction of OMEx in fuel blends was discussed in detail. It was shown
that this soot reduction potential can be utilized to also drastically
reduce nitric oxide emissions, but this requires knowledge of the OMEx
content in the fuel and based on this, appropriate changes to the engine
control system. With neat OMEx, PM emissions significantly below
Euro VI and even below the discussed Euro VII limits can be achieved
without aftertreatment, and in combination with a state-of-the-art SCR
NOx emissions can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude
compared to Euro VI legislation to almost the detection limit.

OMEx, with the exception of the volatile OME1, can be regarded
as promising blend components when the material compatibility of
the engine and engine components is ensured. In Section 4.1.9 we

have established that appropriate materials exist. If suitably designed,
future diesel vehicles could run on increasing shares of OMEx with
minor changes to engine control parameters such as injection duration,
timing, and EGR rate relative to conventional diesel fuel. However,
potential savings from a simplified exhaust aftertreatment system made
possible by OMEx emission reduction can only be realized if the min-
imum OMEx blend fraction is known during vehicle design. However,
smaller savings due to, e.g., less demand for SCR aftertreatment can
also be achieved if the share of OMEx changes throughout the vehicle
life time, as long as it is known during operation. In any case, possible
savings in the aftertreatment system are likely offset by increased
fuel costs. For existing vehicles, a retro-fit of sealing and fuel piping
materials is also possible. This might enable older vehicles to meet
today’s more stringent pollutant emission standards, while at the same
time reducing well-to-wheel CO2 emissions, if OMEx is utilized in the
fuel. This might also increase the life time of current vehicles as vehicle
owners living or working in low emission zones are not forced to
switch to a newer model, reducing the global warming impact of new
vehicle production. To fully leverage the soot and nitric oxide emission
reduction potential lined out in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, knowledge of the
OMEx content in the fuel and, based on this, appropriate changes to
the engine control system are required.

We have also shown in Section 6.3 that OMEx produced using
renewable energy throughout the entire production chain can achieve
significant reductions of well-to-wheel green house gas emissions by
more than 90 % compared to a fossil diesel base case. From a GWP
perspective, such an e-fuel is thus more than capable of achieving
the desired reduction in well-to-wheel CO2 emissions to reach current
climate change prevention goals. As showcased in Sections 6.1 and 6.2,
in particular the advanced production pathways for OMEx can also be
competitive in terms of production efficiency compared to other e-fuel
candidates if the advanced production pathways are utilized and the
net heat demand can be efficiently covered. For the latter, e.g., usage
of low-exergy waste heat from other industrial processes would be
desirable to reduce the demand of high-exergy H2 or water for heat
generation. Even without such measures, high energetic production
efficiencies of up to around 60 % are estimated in the literature. In terms
of production costs, OMEx are more expensive than other e-fuels such as
methanol, DME, or FT-diesel, with costs between around 2 and 4 e per
liter diesel equivalent. However, they also have significant application
advantages compared to them, such as massive soot reduction com-
pared to FT-diesel and advantageous liquid fuel properties compared
to DME and methanol such as lubricity, handling, and toxicity.

The simultaneous reduction of pollutant emissions and GHG en-
visioned for different applications in the mobility sector requires a
range of technological solutions to find a good compromise providing
GHG reduction with minimum social challenges and costs. Several
sustainable forms of energy including electricity, hydrogen, but also
synthetic fuels such as OMEx could be valid alternatives. In order to
evaluate their impact on GHG reduction, they need to be compared on
a cradle-to-grave basis. At present, particularly in the transportation
sector, solutions are compared on a tailpipe basis (tank-to-wheel),
which does not consider the large scale environmental impacts, for
instance in terms of carbon emissions, associated with well-to-wheel
part of the energy and the difference in vehicle production. Appropriate
regulation (i.e., including emissions trading in the transport sector)
would be helpful globally and could minimize the cost of the required
transition to a carbon-neutral society. In addition to electrification,
especially for the defossilization of the existing fleet in the trans-
portation sector, carbon neutral fuels, such as OMEx, are needed. The
different technologies are not in competition with each other, but are
rather complementary to provide efficient, cost-effective solutions in
a timely manner. However, to enable these technologies for any of
the potential applications discussed in the preceding Section 6, the
numerous remaining research questions lined out in this review will
have to be addressed.
