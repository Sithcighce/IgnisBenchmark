Over the last decade, many computational models have been presented to describe the complex ther-
momechanical behaviour of solid oxide fuel cells. The present study elucidates a detailed literature re-
view of the proposed numerical models, ranging from a single channel or unit layer, up to coupled 3D
high-end system models. Thermomechanical modelling foundations, including material properties and
thermomechanical stress sources in SOFCs are emphasized. Employed material models for SOFC com-
ponents are highlighted. Thermomechanical modelling issues such as geometrical idealisation, initial and
boundary conditions for the highly coupled fluid and solid mechanics problem, as well as numerical
solutions have been discussed. Thermomechanical stressestrain formulation of the common fuel cell
components is highlighted. Finally, an overview of the numerically solved thermomechanical modelling
studies in solid oxide fuel cells is given. Case studies are used throughout this review to exemplify and
shed light on several modelling aspects.

1. Introduction

Fuel cells are one of the oldest energy conversion technologies,
originating back to the 19th century [1e4]. Like batteries and wind
power technologies they provide low CO2 and SO2 emissions. Their
advantages, including high efficiencies, low pollutant emission,
high volumetric and gravimetric power densities, no re-charge
duration makes them attractive in terms of an electricity source,
as well as an energy converter. This extendable list of traits makes
the fuel cell technology a serious high-end competitor against
technologies like batteries and internal combustion engines. One of
the most important fuel cell types has been the high temperature
operating solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology. It has a wide
range of application due to its compactness and ease of
manufacturing [5]. It can be utilised as a combined heat and power
generation system for stationary, military, portable or mobile ap-
plications [6e11]. The fundamental mechanism of a solid oxide fuel
cell lies in the oxidation of a fuel at an anode electrode and the
reduction of oxygen at a cathode electrode, as to generate a po-
tential difference. More specifically, these phenomena occur among
four major interacting components namely, the interconnector
plates, electrolyte, cathode, and the anode. The electrolyte is a
membrane that separates the oxygen electrode (called as cathode)
and the fuel electrode (called as the anode). The exploded view of
typical SOFC components is shown in Fig. 1.

Oxygen ions from air that are supplied to the cathode electrode
via the channels present in the interconnector plates is reduced to
O2(cid:2) at the cathode side, transported across the dense electrolyte
and reacts with H2 fuel at the anode side releasing electrons [Fig. 2].
The electrons released at the anode are transported through an
external circuit where electrical power can be drawn. The fuel cell
can be typically operated at temperatures 600(cid:3)Ce1000 (cid:3)C. This is
the range the electrolyte becomes conductive to oxygen ions, but
nonconductive to electrons. The high operating temperatures of
including the minimisation of
SOFCs have some advantages,
polarisation losses and fuel impurity tolerance [12,13].

In solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) several functional materials,
including the electrolyte, cathode, anode interconnector plates, and
sealants have to be joined together as to form an assembly.
Therefore, effort has been given by many researchers to develop
and investigate materials with similar thermomechanical proper-
ties. Each material has to fulfill different requirements, thus this has
been a challenge for many years. Investigations about the compo-
sitions of those materials have been elucidated in several studies, in
detail [14e20]. Today, it is commonly accepted that the dense
electrolyte materials are usually made of yttrium stabilized zirconia
(YSZ), or composite materials like nickel oxide and polycrystals of
zirconia etc. [15,17]. The adjacent porous electrodes, namely the
cathode and anode are variants of calcium doped manganite
compositions and Ni-YSZ, respectively. The metal components i.e.,
the interconnector plates and frames are usually made of ceramics
or of metallic alloys [20]. From a thermomechanical analyst point of
view, the properties of the materials are of interest rather than
which and why a particular material has been chosen. However,
experienced scientists and engineers, particularly in research and
development are strongly encouraged to read, understand and
educate themselves in those areas, as to perform from scratch
meaningful analyses. Hence, their contribution to the design and
development of the technology will be extremely beneficial.

Despite the tremendous effort in many SOFC research areas, full
commercialisation of the technology still encounters many tech-
nological problems. Apart from the large scale implementation
problems, the reliability and robustness of an SOFC design are of
concern. Thermomechanically induced stress within fuel cells have
attracted the attention of the community after hermeticity prob-
lems or mechanical degradation issues became significantly pre-
sent in practice. Thereby, two focal points are investigated. The
mechanical stability of the membrane electrolyte assembly (MEA)
is one area, as the failure of the MEA will lead to failure of the stack
operation. Many researchers have been focused to this problem, as
to gather detailed insight about the mechanical or thermo-
mechanical behaviour of the MEA. The second important challenge

i.e., the hermetic sealing of the whole fuel cell components is
required as to prevent gas leakage, separating the fuel and oxidant
within the fuel cell and to hold the fuel cell components together.
The sealants must be chemically and mechanically compatible with
the different oxide and metallic cell components. Moreover, they
have to be electrically insulating. Currently, there are three types of
sealants utilised; namely, compressive, compliant and rigid.
Compressively bonded sealants require an externally applied load,
whereas compliant sealants are susceptible to chemical reactions
and are electrically conductive. Rigid sealants, regarded as glass and
glasseceramics are rigidly bonded to the cell components, can
prevent leakage and mixing of gasses and are electrically insulating.
Moreover, they are flexible in design, easy to manufacture, and
cost-competitive.

One of the major challenges in sealing is the hermetic and
structural reliability. The sealants must endure thermal cycling,
because the brittle material can exhibit static, dynamic as well as
thermal fatigue [17]. An extended overview about sealant re-
quirements, as well as current technologies of sealant materials in
SOFC technology has been given by Fergus [18] and Mahapatra [19].
To investigate and improve the structural reliability and thermo-
mechanical behaviour of the sealants and the SOFC components,
numerical modelling has gained importance. However, among
various SOFC models introduced in the literature, particular focus
has still been given to the thermofluid flow and electrochemical
behaviour [12,21e23], whereas less attention has been given to the
thermomechanically induced stress within SOFCs and its compo-
nents. But to compete with traditional power systems and ensure
the same structural reliability and long-term stability, a better

understanding and management of

the component

susceptible to thermomechanical stress and strain need to be
assessed. Accordingly, the present article aims to elucidate the
current status of
the numerically solved thermomechanical
modelling activities in SOFCs. Thermomechanical foundations and
mathematical
formulations are highlighted. Complementary
studies have been used to shed light on some important modelling
issues and the effect on the thermomechanical behaviour of SOFCs.

2. Thermomechanical modelling foundations

The current section is focussing on some fundamental aspects
that explain and shed light on numerically modelling the thermo-
mechanical behaviour of SOFCs.

2.1. Thermomechanical material properties

To simulate and predict the thermomechanical behaviour of
SOFCs requires reliable values for the thermal and mechanical
properties of the materials used. The results of the thermo-
mechanical analyses strongly depend on the thermophysical pro-
cesses considered and the material data utilised in the model. Since
material properties are temperature dependent [24e26], the actual
temperature experienced by the fuel cell will affect the overall
thermomechanical stress results by altering the physical properties.
Thus, ignoring temperature dependency of the material properties
will significantly lead to inaccuracies in the predictions. In general,
thermal properties of the fuel cell materials describe how they
respond to a change in thermal energy, i.e., heat. The atoms of the
materials are in vibration, which constitute to the thermal energy of
like thermal
the material. Thermal properties of the material

conductivity, thermal diffusivity, thermal expansion and heat ca-
pacity are all occulted phenomena of this vibration. The mechanical
response and the reliability of the SOFCs are determined by the
state of thermomechanically induced stress to which the assembly
components are subject to. Prior to thermomechanical analysis, the
analyst requires thermal properties of the used fluid media for the
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses, as well. However,
properties of gases are commonly known by scientists over the
years, even a particular study for SOFC applications is given [27].
Hence, the present thermal properties are outlined briefly and
limited to the solid state fuel cell materials used. Moreover, the
analyst requires useful data as to proceed with the work, thus
sources from the literature are given. The thermal properties pro-
vided to perform analyses will comprise the typical SOFC materials
i.e., interconnector plates, wire-mesh, anode, cathode, electrolyte
and the sealant materials.

2.1.1. Heat capacity

The heat capacity of a solid relates the temperature of a body
with the energy supplied to it. DSC measurements are employed to
determine the heat capacity of the SOFC materials. For thermo-
mechanical analyses, values between 20 (cid:3)C and 1000 (cid:3)C are
determined. Anode materials like Ni-YSZ are measured within inert
gas environment as to avoid oxidation of Ni. The effect of porosity,
which is important for continuum modelling approaches, is usually
assumed as negligible low for anode and electrolyte materials [28].
For the use of effective material properties for wire mesh struc-
tures, it can be referred to Ref. [29]. Useful data for the analysts are
provided by Ref. [30]. Table 1 illustrates some sample values.

2.1.2. Thermal conductivity & thermal diffusivity

The temperature of a material cannot be altered spontaneously,
but depends on its thermal conductivity. As known, the thermal
conductivity of solids varies considerably. In the present section, it
has been targeted to shed light on the link between the thermal
conductivity and thermomechanics. Lower thermal conductivities
avoid reaching steady state temperature distributions fast, which
after sometime result in large thermal gradients. These gradients
are a measure between the cold and warm ends of the material; as
for instance, it is the case of the operation and shut-down stages of
a fuel cell system. As a result of thermal gradients, thermally
induced strain and stresses are triggered. The exposure time of
materials to those stresses play at high temperatures a significant
role; as this contributes to the long-term strain behaviour of a fuel
cell. The importance of the thermal conductivity can be interpreted
using the definition of thermal diffusivity (a) as:

which is not beneficial thermomechanically. On the other hand, it
should be noted that fuel cell auxiliary components like heat ex-
changers desire exactly such a thermal effect, as to store the heat
within the solid body and not retain it in the carrier fluid. This
property is one of the reasons ferrite steels are choices in fuel cell
technologies compared to austenitic steels with their higher ther-
mal conductivities and diffusivities. Moreover, due to the different
thermal conductivities, different temperature distributions would
develop when those steels are compared at steady state, as lower
thermal gradients in ferritic steels result in lower thermal strain.
Typical thermal conductivities useful for thermomechanical simu-
lations are given in Refs. [12,28]. Table 2 depicts some sample
values.

2.1.3. Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)

The coefficient of

thermal expansion differences between
assembled fuel cell materials are of paramount importance. The
behaviour of the joined components is based on the variation of
potential energy stored and linked between atoms as a function of
their spacing. Considering a typical potential energy curve vs.
interatomic distance diagram, the vibrational energy of the atoms
rise during heating and due to the asymmetry of the curve, the
mean interatomic spacing r0 i.e., distance between them increases
(shown as ri, r2 etc.) [Fig. 3]. As the initial low temperature is
increased, the energy read in the diagram increases from E1, E2 up
to Ei. The mean separation of atoms, meanwhile changes to r1, r2 up
to ri. The centre point is displaced and as a result an expansion
occurs. The slope of the curve indicates the strength of the bonds
among the atoms, with the stronger bonds the deeper slope. The
bonding strength determines whether or not the atoms are willing
to depart from each other. Hence, a higher slope results in a lower
rate of increase in interatomic distance, yielding to lower desire to
expand.

In general, materials subject to thermal load are willing to
expand, so are the materials used for the fuel cell applications.
However, some materials due to their supramolecular structures

The specific heat capacity (Cp) and density (r) for solids remain
approximately constant. However, at low thermal conductivities
(k), a high thermal gradient develops within the material wall even
at steady state. Compared to a material with higher thermal con-
ductivity, the wall temperatures within the material will be higher,

act inversely upon heating. Therefore they contract, showing a
negative thermal expansion coefficient, as it is the case for some
metal oxides [31e34]. In fuel cell technologies, it is important to
choose materials with thermal expansion coefficients close to
another, as they will be joined together. This will affect the strain
capability of the components within the assembly, contributing to
the stress tensor. The interconnector plates and the MEA materials
together with the very important sealants require matching of CTE,
as to limit thermomechanically induced stress. The CTE of a sealant
should not differ by more than 1 (cid:4) 10(cid:2)6 K(cid:2)1 with the interfacing
SOFC components, in order to obtain pore and crack free interface.
In practice, a CTE of 10.0 (cid:4) 10(cid:2)6 K(cid:2)1e12.0 (cid:4) 10(cid:2)6 K(cid:2)1 is required for
seal glass [19]. Thermal expansion coefficients used for modelling
input requires several values as a function of temperature, other-
wise the solver will interpolate between two temperature values
leading to inaccuracies. Fig. 4 depicts a sample data, enabling the
analyst to extract the values that may be useful for analyses.

Recent computer models of SOFCs [35e37] were developed
using non-destructive X-ray holotomography that are based on
synchrotron or sample sectioning using focus ion beam (FIB)
combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These enabled
to compare and extend the use of experimentally determined
including thermal expansion coefficients
material properties,
[38e41]. Studies like these show that morphological properties like
porosity or formation factor have negligible effect on the thermal
expansion coefficient, suggesting for the analyst the use of bulk
coefficient of thermal expansion data for their continuum models
based on the theory of porous media.

2.1.4. Young's modulus

There have been various studies about the Young's modulus of
SOFC materials. As the Young's modulus is an indication of the

stiffness of a material and is temperature dependent, it is exceed-
ingly important to consider its temperature dependency during
modelling the thermomechanical behaviour of SOFC materials and
components. A constant elastic deformation would only be valid for
a linear approach. However, the SOFC applications are highly non-
linear due to the high temperatures they are employed; thus, ma-
terial non-linearities have to be considered. Temperature depen-
dent properties useful for non-linear thermomechanical SOFC
analyses can be obtained from Refs. [42e47].

2.1.5. Poisson's ratio

The Poisson's ratio is a parameter required by the modeller to
evaluate the lateral dimensional change of a material or component
under load. Most of the metals show values within a range of
0.25e0.35. Useful data for the SOFC materials can be used from
Refs. [48,49]. Table 3 gives some examples.

2.2. Sources inducing thermomechanical stress in SOFCs

The thermomechanically induced stress within a fuel cell as-
sembly results mainly due to sources, affecting the overall stiffness
of the joined composite assembly. Basically, the stiffness is a
function of material properties, shape and the constraints between
each constituent within the assembly. Most of these properties are
influenced particularly through the manufacturing process, the fuel
cell operation environment, operation stages and type, as well as
the geometrical fuel cell configuration and the employed flow type.

2.2.1. Stresses due to fuel cell manufacturing processes

Residual stresses are a source of stress that can be investigated
within this category. It can be considered within the effect of ma-
terial properties with combined thermal effects. The coefficient of
thermal expansion plays a role after the fuel cell assembly is cooled
down to room temperature. The residual stresses reach their
maxima by cooling down the assembly to room temperature.
Mismatch in the thermoelastic properties of constituents, stresses
associated with constraints and external forces required to package
the fuel cell interact altogether; finally, a resultant stress arises. It
should be noted that the numerical modelling of residual stresses
during the manufacturing process assumes a stress free tempera-
ture value around 800(cid:3)Ce1400 (cid:3)C, depending on the materials
joined together. In an earlier study by Yakabe et al. [96], this effect
was studied comparing the results with X-ray measurements

was assumed and a steady state of approximately 6 min after start-
up was predicted for the used three-cell stack model.

As the thermal profile will change over time, the thermo-
mechanical behaviour of the stack is affected, as well. Heating-up
can be performed electrically, or via fluid flow or both. Modelling
of the transient heating-up stage should account both for the
thermofluid flow and thermal radiation [52e57]. Moreover, the
temperature dependent material properties need to be considered,
as over time the temperature and the associated material proper-
ties at the specified temperatures change. This has a significant
effect on the mechanical properties of the materials at elevated
temperatures. The material models used have to account for the
non-linearities, as well; in particular, for the ductile metal com-
ponents that show elastoplastic behaviour. Recent studies using full
scale fuel cell stacks account for the elastoplastic behaviour, as well
as the material non-linearities [49,50]. Studies reveal that the non-
linear behaviour of metal components dominate the thermo-
mechanical behaviour of the joined sealant materials, leading to
leakage [50,53]. High-end models, simulating whole fuel cell sys-
tems in 3D, show the complex thermomechanical behaviour of
interacting system components [58]. Studies like [54,55], empha-
size the importance of the effect of interacting fuel cell system
components during heating-up, as the whole thermomechanical
fuel cell behaviour and hermeticity is depending on this interaction
[Fig. 8]. Moreover, the initial stages of the heating-up seems to be
the most critical one, thus optimising the heating-up process is of
paramount importance. Research in this direction has usually been
in only accounting for the transient thermal behaviour [12]. How-
ever, the thermomechanical response needs to be considered, as
the temperature profile and gradients are not the only factors that
determine the overall behaviour.

2.2.2.2. Operation stage. It is the stage where the electrochemical
reactions of the fuel cell starts, thus internally heat is released. It is
this stage in which the long-term thermomechanical reliability is of
importance, as to fulfill the general desire to operate around
40,000 h. Modelling the long term behaviour i.e. steady state oper-
ation requires additional experimental data. The temperature, time
and stress rate dependent material behaviour of the used SOFC
components need to be addressed; in addition, to the temperature
dependent material properties and the rate independent elasto-
plastic behaviour. Detailed experimentally validated 3D analyses
with the aid to understand leakage and hermeticity problems show
clearly that the long-term behaviour is strongly affected by the creep
strain of the metal components, as the creep strain leads to an extent
of stress relief after long-term operation. This behaviour affects the
joined brittle sealants as the high deformation tendency of the steel
components, which are stiffer and pull the sealant and subject them
to tensile stresses [Fig. 9]. Moreover, the effect of the operation
environment [51] and operating conditions affect the thermo-
mechanical behaviour significantly [59]. If a standalone component
analysis of a stack is performed within a furnace, it is important to
account for the furnace domain, as the angle or view factors calcu-
lated by the used radiation model is affected through the shape,
distance of the fuel cell stack to the emitting parts of the furnace.

2.2.2.3. Shut-down stage. The shut-down stage is the period the
fuel cell system is cooled from the steady operation stage to room
temperature. 3D detailed thermomechanical analyses show that
the initial stages of the cooling phase shows higher thermal gra-
dients [53]. These become significant at the manifold regions as the
inner regions are still warmer. The effect of the local temperature
difference was determined to be the main cause, as the thermal
expansion coefficient decreased just 8%, whereas the temperature
decreased 60%, indicating that the local temperature difference

(Fig. 5). Predicted values depicted the effect of the joining tem-
perature on the electrolyte residual stress. The Principal stresses
varied from 550 MPa to 670 MPa.

Moreover, it should be considered that the manufacturing pro-
cess is a transient one. For instance, transient thermal modelling
must consider the overall thermal mass of the assembly; i.e., to
assume a channel model and cooling it ten hours will not give the
same result as cooling the whole fuel cell stack for ten hours.
Models that consider the whole components are likely to be rep-
resenting the actual over time behaviour. Fig. 6 presents some
computational models used for predicting the thermomechanical
behaviour of SOFCs. Full assembly models like [49e53] should be
used for the transient thermomechanical behaviour of fuel cells.
Accounting for the heat loss in simpler geometries will not give
sufficient information about the thermomechanical behaviour of
the fuel cell stack and the interacting interconnector plates, seal-
ants and MEA, over time.

2.2.2. Stresses due to fuel cell operation

Thermomechanically induced stress due to fuel cell operation
has several reasons. First of all, it should be borne in mind that if the
SOFC components would not be joined together and have a uniform
temperature distribution, they would be freely deforming, thus no
stresses would arise. If a temperature profile would be present, only
stresses within each material would arise locally, but not due to the
neighbour components. However, as the SOFC materials are joined
together, arbitrary motion is hindered because the materials are
constrained. The stress increases as the resistance to motion is
increased. This is in association with the stiffness of a material (as
mentioned it is a function of the constraints, preventing the ma-
terial to move arbitrarily). The thermomechanical modelling within
this section requires both transient and steady state coupled
thermofluid-thermomechanical approaches, as to predict
the
complex multiphysics behaviour.

2.2.2.1. Heating-up stage. The heating-up stage is the period the
fuel cell stack is heated from room temperature to an operateable
temperature of 650(cid:3)Ce750 (cid:3)C (or even more). During the transient
process, a temperature distribution will occur and the induced
strain and stress will change with time. A transient numerical study
performed by Lin et al. [49] depicts the unsymmetrical and non-
uniform thermal profile evolution, considering the thermo-
electrochemical reactions [Fig. 7]. A current density of 640 mAcm(cid:2)2

dominates the thermal strain and the stress within the early stages
of the cooling process [53]. For simulating the cooling-process, it is
important to account for the initial thermal profile from the oper-
ation stage and the natural convection around the fuel cell or the
heat loss through the insulation material. Moreover, if the stack is
cooled down through air, this needs to be considered.

introduced in Chapter 4 has been one sample of these. These should
be one of the potential research areas still to be investigated, as to
improve the understanding of geometrical design effects on issues
like hermeticity and fuel cell gas leakage. The effects of sealant designs
are however, depicted in the literature as to shed light on different
sealant layouts [30,51e53,59e61].

2.3. Stresses due to design and configuration

3. Material models

The geometrical effect on the thermomechanical fuel cell behav-
iour is directly related to the stiffness of the material or component, as
it has been depicted previously. The different geometrical models and
flow configurations used in the reference studies throughout this
article have different effects on the thermo fluid flow behaviour of
SOFCs. These are usually depicted within those studies. However,
there are very few studies depicting the thermomechanical compar-
isons those thermal fields influence. The response and effect of
simplifying their geometrical features is also underpinned. The study

The numerical modelling of the SOFC materials and components
requires carefully mimicking the response of the utilised materials
and components that are subject to loading of pure mechanical or
loads. For this purpose, a
coupled nature,
mathematical description of the relation between the stress and
strain tensor in the SOFC materials is necessary. This mathematical
description is named as a constitutive model. In general, the
stressestrain behaviour of SOFC materials can be grouped into two
major approaches, namely the linear and non-linear material

including thermal

modelling approaches.
In order to understand the thermo-
mechanical material modelling of SOFC components, it is necessary
to comprehend linear and non-linear material models.

3.1. Linear thermoelastic approach

The linear thermoelasticity theory is a common approach used to
describe the thermomechanical behaviour of materials. One of the
most important characteristics of materials, obeying the linear

approach is their low tensile strength. Tensile cracking is observed
under low stress compared to compressive cracking. Each material
has a unique curve, but for most materials, the initial curve is a
straight line, reflecting this linear relationship between the stress
and strain. This is called the 'Elastic' range. Hooke's Law only applies
in this range. Most of the SOFC sealant materials, including glass-
eceramics have only an elastic range, thus can be described using
this model. The term 'stiffness' defines the fundamental difference
between the linear and non-linear approach. Stiffness is a property

of a material, part or assembly that characterises its response to the
applied load. Shape, material type and part support i.e. constraints
change the stiffness of the component. When a structure deforms
under a load its stiffness changes, due to one or more of the factors
listed above. If it deforms a great deal, its shape can change. If the
material reaches its failure limit, the material properties will change.
On the other hand, if the change in stiffness is small enough, it
makes sense to assume that neither the shape nor material prop-
erties change at all during the deformation process. This assump-
tion is the fundamental principle of a linear analysis. That means
that throughout the entire process of deformation, the analysed
material or component model retained whatever stiffness it
possessed in its undeformed shape prior loading. Regardless of how
much the material or component deforms, whether the load gets
applied in one step or gradually, and no matter how high the
stresses that develop in response to that load may be, the used
model retains its initial stiffness.

and εxy denote the shear strains in each plane. The Poisson's ratio is
shown as n and the modulus of elasticity as E. The thermo-
mechanically induced stress is calculated as:

3.2. Non-linear approach

At elevated temperatures the real material behaviour departs
from the idealised elastically treated material behaviour. The ma-
terial behaviour becomes non-linear and can no more be treated
using the theory of thermoelasticity. For this kind of materials, the
theory of plasticity is valid.

3.2.1. Rate-independent non-linear approach

To explore the non-linear

rate independent elastoplastic
behaviour of the SOFC components used, it is indispensable to
know how the stress induced from particular loads characterise the
deformation of the material. Experimental data needs to be ac-
quired to imitate the behaviour and be implemented in numerical
models. Unlike elastic materials, non-linear materials change their
stiffness during the deformation process, which must during the
numerical simulations be updated. Those iterations increase the
amount of time it takes to obtain accurate results. Hence, a non-
linear analysis becomes necessary when the stiffness of the
component changes. If change in stiffness comes only from changes
in shape, the non-linear behaviour is defined as geometric non-
linearity. If the material properties change as well, material non-
linearity is also of concern. The non-linear materials behave such
that once they are stressed past their elastic limit, they will
permanently deform. The non-linear deformation is plastic; i.e.,
upon unloading only the elastic strain part can be recovered from
the total strain, whereas the plastic strain retains.

This means the material has yielded and will stretch easily with
little additional load. Next, the material cross-section will become
smaller, which is called “necking”. Since the cross-sectional area is
reducing, the effective or true stress increases. However, many
times the stress calculations will use the original cross sectional
area (called the nominal area) and this makes the stressestrain
curve appear to decrease. Fig. 10 illustrates the steps a non-linear
material goes through upon loading.

Typically, the used SOFC steel components of ductile nature are
modelled as non-linear, accounting both for the elastic and plastic
behaviour of the materials. The MEA parts, as well as wire-mesh
structures are also modelled within this approach. It is vital to
understand and accurately characterise the material behaviour of
the used fuel cell components as to choose the right approach prior
to performing the thermomechanical analysis.

where {εel}, {εpl} are the elastic and plastic strain vectors respec-

the hardening rules it is referred to [62,63]. The hardening rule
states that the yield criterion changes with isotropic hardening.

the elastic strain part that solely contributes to the mechanical
strain within the linear approach. The thermal strain vector {εth} is
analogue to Equation (3).

Based on the mathematical theory of plasticity, the plastic
deformation behaviour of the material can be described by the
three components of the rate-independent plasticity model i.e.
yield criterion, flow rule and hardening rule. The yield criterion (e.g.
Von Mises or Tresca) determines the stress level at which yielding is
initiated. This is represented by the equivalent stress seq, which is a
function of the individual stress vector components {s}. The
yielding of most solids is independent of the sign of the stress state.
This is the reason why for most materials, the yield strengths in
tension and compression are equal. Plastic strain is developed in
the non-linear SOFC parts when the equivalent stress is equal to a
material yield parameter sy; finally, the flow rule determines the
direction of plastic straining and is given by Ref. [50]:

where, the plastic multiplier l determines the amount of plastic
straining and Q denotes the plastic potential that establishes the
direction of plastic straining.

The hardening rule describes the relationship of stressestrain to
increase further the amount of stress to produce additional strain
after having reached the elastic limit. The isotropic hardening rule
is used where the yield surface remains centred about its initial
centreline and expands in size as the plastic strains develop. Ki-
nematic hardening is the expanded version of the isotropic hard-
ening, as it represents the translation of the yield surface in stress
space by shifting its reference point from the centreline, thus the
length of the stress interval representing the elastic region remains
constant. Hence, in practice these mean that if the equivalent stress
computed using elastic material properties exceeds the material
yield, then plastic straining must occur. Plastic strains reduce the
stress state so that it satisfies the yield criterion. For details about

3.2.2. Rate-dependent non-linear approach

The second important non-linear approach that describes the
material behaviour of fuel cell components comprises the stress,
strain rate and time dependence. When the fuel cell components
are subjected to a constant mechanical load, the change in di-
mensions needs to be considered. This permanent inelastic defor-
mation differs from the rate independent plasticity, as it occurs
below the yield point of the material, whilst subject to long term
stress. This phenomenon is called creep and needs to be included
within the numerical calculations. Equation (6) becomes an added
creep strain vector for this type of analysis. Unlike the rate inde-
pendent plasticity, rate dependent creep does not need a higher
stress value to develop more strain. It can develop at all non-zero
stress values [51]. Under constant load, the strain vs. time behav-
iour of creep shows three typical regimes. The first one i.e., primary
creep includes the stage in which the strain rate over time de-
creases, whereas the secondary stage shows a constant strain rate.
The tertiary creep is the last stage that describes the strain,
increasing until failure takes place. The implementation of creep
strain into numerical analyses requires experimental data and
statistical analysis, thus is usually omitted. However, with the
increasing experimental studies in creep strain of fuel cell com-
ponents [46,60,64e69], the inclusion of rate dependent material
models increased. Modelling the thermomechanical creep strain

effect and its stress relieving behaviour in whole fuel cell stacks has

4. Thermomechanical modelling issues

Numerical thermomechanical modelling in SOFCs requires great
care. Beginning from the considered geometrical model up to the
mitigation of numerical problems several aspects need to be
considered. The current chapter aims to shed light on some
important numerical modelling issues often seen in practice.

4.1. Computational geometry idealisation

The computational domain used for the solution of the ther-
momechanical problem in fuel cells is very important, as it in-
fluences the accuracy and reliability of the predicted results. This
section investigates the effects and limits of the assumptions on the
solution of the thermomechanical analysis. The objective is to un-
derstand some differences in modelling assumptions and simpli-
fications. The thermomechanically induced stress of the fuel cell
components will be in particular the focus.

4.1.1. Two dimensional vs. three dimensional approaches

A typical issue in thermomechanical modelling of fuel cells is
whether to use a 3D analysis or to employ a 2D approach. All
components used in fuel cell technologies are 3D in nature, but
geometrical approximations are usually made to facilitate simple
stress analyses. Usually, a preliminary geometrical design of the
structure is proposed by employing a trial section of the whole
component. The loads that may act on the component are esti-
mated and the mathematical models to be tested. The detailed
geometry is used in design and detailing stage where the constit-
uents are designed to satisfy safety and long-time service re-
quirements. Hence, the characteristics of the real fuel cell must be
represented as accurate as possible by a substitute model. This must
be such that the thermomechanical response predicted by the
analysis is relevant to the real structure.

If the geometry and loads of a problem can be completely
described in one single plane, a 2D model approach can be adopted;
otherwise the analyst needs to perform a 3D analysis. Simplifica-
tion is only possible if the geometry of the structure and the loading
conditions have the same symmetry. But how far can a 2D

thermomechanical analysis of fuel cell components deviate from a
3D approach? The answer certainly depends on many factors,
including load distribution, material homogeneity, constraints,
shape etc. A micro model of a fuel cell section will be used to shed
light on the issue. The used section has been assumed to be cut out
of the hottest region of a fuel cell unit layer. This is considered as
753 (cid:3)C. The considered section is within a uniform temperature
region. This also ensures to neglect the variation of mechanical
properties of all constituents due to temperature change. Therefore,
the comparison can be performed based on the third dimension
effect. A mechanical force of 10 N is applied on the interconnector
plate as to imitate the mechanical load applied on fuel cells. Fig. 11
illustrates the difference in thermomechanically induced stress.

The stress distribution plots illustrate the stress distribution
within the composite multilayer assembly. To focus on the
geometrical effect, only the wire-mesh component has been illus-
trated with its distribution, whereas only the edges of the
remaining components are visible. The bodies are plotted as
translucent. The wire-mesh has been considered as behaving
elastically, which is sufficient for the purpose of relative compari-
son. This explains the higher stress value. It can be seen that the 2D
model predicts all over the wire-mesh compressive or low tensile
stress illustrated dark blue. The 2D plane that has been cut-off the
3D analysis shows that higher tensile stresses are present and that
these depart considerably from the uniformly distributed dark blue
region into multi-coloured distribution. The quantitative difference
can be noticed when the 3D full analysis is viewed. The results
reveal that the tensile stress around the wavy portion on each
thread shows a tensile stress value located in the 26e40 MPa range,
whereas higher values are predicted at the contact regions between
each wire thread. When at a contact region the upper wire thread
pushes down the beneath one, the neighbour thread in the second
row is pushed up. This effect is ignored in the 2D approach, thus the
stress is distributed much lower as it should be. The tensile stress is
due to the effect of the third dimension, giving rise to stress as the
component is hindered in different angles to strain. In practice,
these undulated regions are the contact areas to the anode, thus the
effect gives an indication of the strain behaviour of the wire-mesh
and the associated contact to the anode component, for instance.
The 2D model is not capable to capture the effects due to the un-
dulation, present in the real 3D structure. The wavy design results
in local stress zones at the contact regions of the undulated wire

mesh. Hence, the 2D model cannot describe the loads in a single
plane, which results in limited information and suggests for the
particular case the use of a 3D analysis.

Influence of geometrical simplifications on the

4.2.
thermomechanical behaviour

Another issue that needs to be resolved is that the analyst
usually has difficulties in how far simplifications in geometry can
be performed for thermomechanical analyses. Apart from the
structural model (3D or 2D), this needs more experience and care,
as significant differences in the results may occur. Depending on
the region and level of simplification, valuable information may
be lost. Fig. 12 illustrates a typical example where a physical wire-
mesh model has been compared to a hypothetical wire mesh,
modelled as a continuum [50]. A uniformly distributed mass of the
solid body is considered, using the porosity of the continua. The
stress and thermal strain distributions illustrated in 3D and 2D
plane, respectively, shed light on the approach differences. The
loss of information at local contact regions present in the real
physical model could not be captured by the uniformly distributed
continuum model based on the theory of porous media. Hence,

the decision of which approach to choose must be carefully
planned; as for instance, contact problems observed in fuel cells
might require a detailed physical model to capture precisely these
local regions.

Another coupled CFD/FEM comparative analysis performed by
using the same thermofluid boundary conditions is illustrated in
Fig. 13 [70]. It shows the thermomechanical effect of simplifying
the fillet regions within a fuel cell component. Accordingly, Case1
with no fillet radius claimed to have the highest thermal gradients
and stress results compared to Case2, whereas Case3 showed the
lowest thermal gradients and also the lowest stress values visible
from the smooth transitions and horizontal behaviour of the lines
[Fig. 13]. The detailed stress analyses inside the region suggested
that the use of higher fillet radius results in higher thermo-
mechanically induced stress, whereas the use of small radii or no
radius increases the induced stress [Fig. 14]. The study clearly
gives an idea of the possible effects on the thermomechanical fuel
cell behaviour when local geometrical regions are arbitrary
simplified.

Hence, the computer model design of the components is of
particular importance. This includes the sealant layout, as well as
the details of the components at the exemplified manifold regions.

4.3. Effect of the initial and boundary conditions on the
thermomechanical behaviour of SOFCs

4.4. Solution methods in thermomechanical SOFC modelling

For the modelling activities a question is, whether or not a
fully coupled computer model
integrated with chemically
reacting species transport and electrochemical reactions is
required. First of all, the temperature profile of the fuel cell is an
important initial condition for the thermomechanical analyses,
thus needs to be obtained either experimentally or numerically.
There have been various attempts to predict the temperature
profile in SOFCs employed to different configurations, geome-
tries, different dimensions and scaling levels [12,22]. The fuel cell
indeed is a heat source, releasing heat due to several factors.
These include and are not limited to Ohmic polarisation (due to
charge transport), activation polarisation (due to electrochemical
reactions at the electrode interfaces), concentration effects (due
to species transport within the porous zones) and due to the
chemical reactions (due to the amount of energy that could not
be converted into electricity) and hot gas temperatures [71]. The
literature shows that some of those effects are omitted or
partially accounted for. These heat sources were assumed to be
released at different locations of the cell and interconnector
plates [72e76].

However, the thermomechanical analyst is particularly inter-
ested in the thermal profile, no matter due to what effect, as the
profile obtained is a boundary condition applied on the ther-
momechanical model. Therefore, it is a step and not the ultimate
goal. The disadvantage of applying heat sources would be the
difficulty of determining the maximum temperature location
within the cell region, as this is dependent on the total polar-
isation and the electrochemical activity, chemical reactions etc.
However this can be mitigated using a simple 1D electrochemical
model and locate the heat source at this region or use the source
as distributed. This approach is a far better assumption rather
than employing an arbitrary constant heat flux or temperature
value. Another option might be depending on region of interest,
to apply experimentally determined data as boundary conditions.
This can be useful to apply where a particular region shows close
to constant values, for instance. Advanced finite element tech-
niques can be utilised to investigate in such a way local ther-
momechanical issues [59,77]. In either approach it is important
to carefully plan what is targeted and upon this the choice of
approach should be determined. The effect of mechanical con-
straints and forces applied coupled on models using thermal load
needs attention, as this will have an effect on the strain and
stiffness behaviour of the analysed component or assembly. A
study by Lin et al. [52] is a typical example, depicting the effects
on component constraints in terms of different support condi-
tions and varying mechanical loads on the thermomechanical
fuel cell behaviour.

Thermomechanical modelling of SOFCs has several basic steps,
which are pretty well known. In general, an idealised computer
visualisation of the physical component or assembly is used to
construct a numerical grid on which calculations are performed.
Governing equations that describe the thermomechanical behav-
iour are utilised and the fixed, free parameters of the model, as well
as any constraints are imposed. Ultimately, an iterative method is
used to solve the non-linear thermomechanical problem and esti-
mate the unknown variables. However, great care and expertise is
needed to adopt smoothly and appropriately the procedure to solve
and evaluate the thermomechanical problem. The goal of this
section is to shed light on some of the difficulties that occur, whilst
thermomechanical modelling and possible solution strategies are
discussed.

4.4.1. Numerical methods and software utilisation

Unfortunately, components and assemblies in the SOFC tech-
nology are not of simple nature. Thus, apart from the complex non-
linear multiphysics and geometry, the thermomechanical boundary
conditions are difficult to describe using closed solutions. There-
fore, the thermomechanical solution is performed numerically. To
make numerical simulations practical, it is necessary to reduce the
number of degrees of freedom to a finite number. This procedure is
called discretization. The ultimate goal is to approximate the gov-
erning equations of thermomechanics by a system of algebraic
equations. This can be done at locations in both time and space,
depending on the steady or transient nature of the problem. To
solve the complex thermomechanical problem, many numerical
approaches are present, where the most important approaches are
the finite element method (FEM), including its variants such as X-
FEM, E-FEM etc. [78e84] and the finite difference method (FDM)
[85] together with its variants, including FVM [86e90]. These ap-
proaches have been developed over time into an indispensable
technology within the thermomechanical modelling and simula-
tion. Both approaches cover a vast field of details, requiring atten-
tion on its own for a thorough description, which is not the focus of
the article. As the thermomechanical problem is a non-linear case,
the iterative solution based on an initial guess that is linearised and
improved, is the fundamental approach. Direct numerical methods
like Gauss elimination or variations of it are usually on low cost;
however are not always applicable, as parallelisation or the use of
irregular, complex geometries is usually an issue. These limit the
use of direct methods to 1D or simple channel SOFC applications,
where parallelisation and geometrical non-linearities play a minor
role. The advantage would be their low cost and fast solution times
together with no iteration errors, as they are on direct basis,
meaning solving non-iteratively. An extensive work in grid ap-
proximations, smoothing and iterative methods, including Jacobi

and Gauss-Seidel or LU decompositions together with comparison
to gradient methods, as well as remarks on software have been
given by authors like Ferziger [88], Versteeg [89], and Wesseling
[91]. For extended details about matrix compositions and the iter-
ative solvers, the reader may refer to Horn and Johnson [92]. Today,
apart from in-house codes, many commercial software developers
implement numerical methods successfully, as to solve thermo-

mechanical problems. ANSYS
are some of the leading software developers enabling complex
thermomechanical analyses, just to mention a few.

4.4.2. Convergence and stability issues

Thermomechanical simulations may sometimes require special
procedures during the numerical calculation. These may arise
during the mechanical analysis or the thermal field calculations.
This may be of particular importance when convergence problems
arise in fuel cell system processes like reforming or combustion,
involving many species and chemical reactions. Furthermore, when
material and geometrical non-linearities are of concern, usually
numerical stability problems occur [93]. The ultimate goal for the
modeller is to keep the calculations robust, fast and cheap. How-
ever, solution techniques are problem specific and cannot be
generalised. Moreover, most of the solution attempts will be
depending on the used software and the implemented algorithm.

Hence, there is no universal solution for the thermomechanical
modeller. However, it is aimed to give some general points, which
the modeller may consider to improve the numerical analyses.

For example, the thermal field is an initial load used in ther-
momechanical analyses. In SOFC applications, this is usually ob-
including thermofluid flow,
tained through CFD analyses
electrochemistry and chemically reacting species transport. The
effect of species transport on the fluid flow distribution may be so
strong that the interaction between the governing equations,
describing the mass and momentum, as well as the species trans-
port requires a strong coupling. Density changes due to the released
heat by chemical reactions lead to fluctuations in the flow. These
may result in convergence difficulties. In practice, when flow
properties are in close association with species concentrations, the
modeller should refer to a stepwise analysis. The principle is soft-
ware independent, thus can be adopted universally. The procedure
relies on that the modeller starts solving the equations for flow,
energy, and species equations without considering the chemical
reactions among the species. This procedure is usually known as
cold-flow analysis. Having obtained an initial flow distribution, the
modeller enables then the reactions of species. Convergence diffi-
culties due to large density change or turbulence may be mitigated
by lowering the under relaxation. Convergence difficulties during
the mechanical analyses are usually due to non-linearity. A large

16

number of contact surfaces that lead to rigid body motion or if the
surfaces are open would result in difficulties. When large de-
formations due to plastic or creep strain occur, some sections of the
mesh can become highly distorted elements. This can cause the
non-linear solution to stop, which may be corrected with element
shape checking options or using load and time subsets and a
damping factor that calculates an artificial velocity, reducing the
displacements at the degree of freedom and stabilises the solution.

5. Literature review of the numerical thermomechanical
modelling in SOFCs

In 2001, Yakabe et al. [94] presented a three dimensional unit
model with bipolar channels that was considered to be chosen from
the centre of a whole SOFC stack. Temperature profiles were ob-
tained for co-flow and counter-current flow configurations. The
analysis neglected the external forces. Thus, only thermally induced
free elongation was considered. Their finding showed that the in-
ternal reforming of the fuel cell would induce a steep drop of fuel
temperature near the inlet, leading to large stresses in the elec-
trolytes. The used material models and properties were not
mentioned.

Two additional studies by Yakabe et al. [95,96] were presented
in 2004. The former study investigated residual stresses within the
electrolyte. Constant thermal boundary conditions were assumed
between neighbour components, as to obtain the temperature
distribution. Experimental measurements were presented to
demonstrate the accuracy of the model. The latter study focused on
the effects of the cell geometry, fabrication method and the flat-
tening treatment of the electrolyte.

Selimovic et al. [97] introduced a coupled thermal structural
analysis, giving emphasis on the thermal stresses due to tempera-
ture gradients and the effect of thermal expansion coefficient on
the cell components. The numerical solution of current density,
species transport and the flow within the air channels was depic-
ted. The mechanical analysis was solely performed on the cell
components, having neglected the interconnector plates. A linear
approach was used and the cell components were assumed to be
free of constraint. Steady state, as well as transient analyses were
conducted.

Nakajo et al. [98] presented in 2006 a study, investigating the
effect of the temperature profile characteristics on the stress field of
the cell components in a tubular SOFC design A simplified Weibull
analysis was performed to evaluate the evolution of the probability
of survival of the cell components in steady and transient state.
Their results revealed that high stress values are achieved within
the whole anode and the edges of the electrolyte. This was attrib-
uted to the thermal expansion coefficient differences. Critical
values were obtained for the probability of survival.

Weil et al. [99] introduced a concept for planar SOFCs. The finite
element method was used to aid in scaling up a bonded compliant
sealant design. The stress of the cell, foil, brazes and frame were
calculated and compared to experimental fracture and yield stress
results. A quarter symmetrical model was used. Thermal cycling
from elevated temperature to room temperature was performed.
Used materials were mentioned; however, no properties were
given. Regarding the structural analysis boundary conditions and
the employed failure criteria, material models were not depicted.
The following year, Lin et al. [49] introduced their 3D thermal
stress results, utilising a multiple cell SOFC stack model. The ther-
mal stress distribution of the planar SOFC stack was investigated for
various process stages, including shutdown and operation stages.
Effects of bottom support conditions, thermal expansion coeffi-
cient, temperature profiles and viscous behaviour of the considered
glasseceramic sealants were investigated. A counter-current flow

thermofluid analysis, including the thermoelectrochemical behav-
iour of the stack was performed to obtain a temperature profile
during the start-up and steady operating stages. Plastic deforma-
tion of the metal parts was implemented using in house experi-
mental data. Their predictions revealed that the glass ceramic is the
most critical part of the investigated stack. The commercialization
of the stack was mentioned not to be feasible. It has been the first
example in which the glasseceramics were considered within the
numerical analysis. Their results implied that the maximum stress
the glasseceramic and cell
occurs around the borders of
components.

Weil et al. [100] presented another study in 2007, considering
bonded compliant sealants. The thermally induced stressestrain
behaviour of the cell, sealant and frame components was inves-
tigated using the 3D finite element method. The assembly was
heated and cooled uniformly. A one-quarter
section was
modelled. The cell was treated computationally as one sole ma-
terial, considering the anode properties. A bilinear elasticeplastic
constitutive model was employed for the interconnector plate.
Material properties obtained from the literature were used. The

considered. They found that some bending results during cooling
down, and that the stress is transferred to the sealant foil and soft
silver braze that were used in the study. The component stresses
were found to be lower in a second thermal cycle compared to the
first cycle.

In 2008, Weil et al. [101] investigated three different bonded
sealant designs, considered as bonded compliant, glasseceramic
and silverecopper oxide air brazed. A finite element model,
including an anode structure, frame and the sealant was used to
calculate the mechanical behaviour of the assembly. A uniform
thermal load was applied for the operational and shut down stage
simulations. A slow heating rate furnace was imitated. The same
boundary conditions as employed in their previous studies were
adopted. The interconnector plates were assumed to be offering
little resistance to the out of plane deformation, thus interpreted as
negligible. The metallic components were treated, using a bilinear
kinematic hardening model, whereas the cell was treated as linear
elastic. The material properties were given in graphic representa-
tion. The results showed highly overpredicted stress values, in
particular using glasseceramics.

In 2009, Lin et al. [52] investigated the thermal stress distribu-
tion of a multi-cell SOFC stack, consisting of three cells joined
together. Interconnector plates, cell, frame, nickel mesh (as con-
tinuum) and glass sealants were considered in the 3D finite
element model. Mica based compressive gaskets were used to seal
the cell, supporting frame and the interconnectors. A counter-
current flow configuration was used to obtain the thermal field of
the used model. A mechanical load ranging from 0.06 MPa to 6 MPa
was investigated. Various instant stages during an operating cycle
were investigated. For the steady operation, results from Lin et al.
[49] were implemented. Information about how the model was
cooled to room temperature or heated up has not been given. The
stress results for the cooling stage and heating up stages were given
for the instant end time of the stages, thus considering a uniform
temperature distribution. Plastic deformation of the metallic parts
was evaluated using the Tresca criterion. Glass sealants were
considered to be linear at room temperature and nonlinear at
operating temperature. Their results implied that a mechanical load
of 0.6 MPa results in optimum bending behaviour. The stresses of
cell, frame, interconnector plates and nickel mesh were claimed to
be mainly resulting from thermal expansion differences and ther-
mal gradients. The use of mica sealant gasket joint resulted in lower
stress values, but considerably higher values compared to glass-
eceramic sealants were achieved at the operating stage.

A comprehensive numerical study, using a bonded compliant
sealant design was introduced by Jiang et al. [30] in the same year. A
unit cell composing of single air and fuel channels, cell, and inter-
connector plates was numerically analysed. The temperature dis-
tribution of the unit cell was obtained. It was assumed that the
whole plate had the same distribution in width, thus the results
were extended to the remaining channels of one single plate. A co-
flow design was selected, employing half of the plate and consid-
ering twenty unit cells for the solution of the structural analysis.
The cell, considered as one layer with anode properties was
assumed to behave elastically; whereas the metallic parts were
considered to behave elasticeplastically, following a bilinear stress
strain relationship. They mentioned that the non-uniform tem-
perature distribution has a significant effect on the stress distri-
bution. The temperature gradient effect on the thermal stress of the
compliant sealant would be comparable to the glasseceramic
sealant design.

Fischer et al. [102] investigated the impact of temperature
profile on the thermal stress, arising in tubular SOFCs. A 2D model
was employed. Constant material properties were used for speci-
fied temperatures. Free expansion was allowed. The effect of ab-
solute temperature and thermal gradients together with the
internal reforming (direct and indirect) was elucidated. Their re-
sults suggested a strong coupling between the reforming method
and the stress distribution. They mentioned that thermal gradients
in tubular SOFCs are less relevant to thermal stress. Nakajo et al.
[103,104] investigated the structural stability issues in planar solid
oxide fuel cells in two articles. The first focussing on cell cracking
and the second one on tightness issues, considering the mismatch
between the coefficients of thermal expansion of the components.
A repeating unit model has been used. They claim that the thermal
gradients and the shape of the temperature profile during opera-
tion induce significant decreases of the contact pressure on the
gaskets near the fuel manifold, at the inlet or outlet, depending on
the flow configuration.

Wenning et al. [105,106] investigated the creep behaviour of
glasseceramic sealants and interconnector plates by having
employed a one-cell [105] and a three-cell SOFC stack model [106],
operating with cross-flow. A continuum approach was attempted,
as the presented geometry showed no physical resolution details of
the components. Their results implied that the creep effect of the
glass and interconnector would change the channel dimensions in
long term operating conditions.

In 2010, Chiang et al. [107] presented a 3D study investigating
the thermofluid and thermal stress behaviour of a single SOFC cell.
The used model included an electrolyte, sandwiched between two
aluminum gas distributors. A uniform load was applied on the top
IeV
surface. The edge points were constrained. Experimental
curves were used for justifying their results. The predicted thermal
stress within the cell was lower at lower temperature gradients.
Their results implied that the stress within the cell is dominated by
the thermal gradients and the thermal expansion coefficient.

Again,

in 2010, a thermomechanical analysis for a micro
tubular SOFC was presented by Serincan et al. [108]. Thermal
stresses arising from the fabrication of the cell, exterior con-
straints, as well as the fuel cell operation was considered. An
axisymmetric 2D approach has been presented. The model
considered aluminum tubes as well as the anode, cathode and the
electrolyte. The predicted thermal field was used in a mechanical
that considered the ceramic sealant. Materials were
model
considered to behave elastically. The properties were calculated
using the composite sphere method. Results suggested that both
compressive and tensile stresses may arise simultaneously in the
same layer, due to interactions among cell and the supporting
structures.

Peksen [109] filed a patent, describing the geometrical design
relations of fuel cell components, affecting the thermomechanically
induced stress behaviour. All dimensions of an interconnector plate
were considered and described as a function of the width of the
plate. The relations clarify the requirements for a robust and ther-
momechanically reliable geometrical design.

Liu et al. [48] presented a numerical study that considered
thermal stress and crack nucleation of a three layer SOFC short
stack model. The model comprised the anode, electrolyte and a thin
interface layer between them. The shear stress and peeling stress
were investigated using the Paris Law. The model considered solely
the cell components, having neglected the remaining metallic and
sealant parts. It was aimed to estimate the life duration of the cell
under thermal cycling for different cell configurations.

A systematic approach combining experimental measurements
as well as post-mortem stack analyses coupled with numerical
analyses were given by Blum et al. [110]. Their results revealed that
even small thermal gradients lead to stress zones within the stack,
in particular at the vicinity of the manifolds. Furthermore, the stack
operating in furnace would not explicitly reflect the stack behav-
iour operating during a real process.

In 2011, a coupled 3D CFD/FEM analysis of an SOFC stack was
presented by Peksen [50]. The study depicted detailed insight about
the limitations of usual assumptions employed within the litera-
ture, including continuum approach vs. discrete approach, as well
as a production scale thermofluid, thermomechanical analysis. The
study investigated a full production scale thirty-six layer stack,
considering its whole components including the cell, sealant, and
metal components. The manifold regions, as well as the channel
regions were presented in physical resolution. Moreover, a broad
the material non-linearity effect was given,
comparison of
including the thermoelastic and plastic strain effect on the ther-
momechanical behaviour of the SOFC stack.

Within the same year, the author presented a hierarchical 3D
modelling approach to model fuel cell system components in 3D,
accounting for the thermomechanical interactions of neighbouring
components. The study showed a road map for modelling whole
systems in 3D [58].

In 2012, Nakajo et al. presented a 3D single layer SOFC model to
investigate several effects in two articles. The first part comprises
effects of operation parameters on the mechanical reliability of the
component [61], whereas the second part [111] attempts to inves-
tigate the electrochemical and/or the mechanical degradation on
the structural behaviour of a planar type single SOFC layer. The
model is not a coupled one, neglecting the time and stress rate
dependence of the long-term creep deformation within the steel
parts. Their results reveal that the system layout has an effect on
the electrochemical degradation. Uncertainty of determining the
critical layer was reported due to the modified thermal profile as a
result of the electrochemical degradation.

Punbusayakul et al. [112] investigated the thermomechanical
behaviour of grove gasket sealing designs for SOFC applications
using FEM modelling. Silver was used as a sealant material. Material
properties between 200 (cid:3)C ad 800(cid:3) have been interpolated. The
Young's modulus of the interconnector plate has been kept con-
stant over the whole temperature range. Their findings suggest that
the use of U shape configuration shows the best leakage perfor-
mance compared to triangular and square cross sections.

In 2012, a high-end model was introduced by Peksen [113]. It
was the first published 3D SOFC system model, comprising all
relevant system components in full scale, including a 36 layer fuel
cell stack, afterburner, heat exchanger, pre-reformer, heating and
baffle plates together with all their sub-components. The 1:1 true
scale coupled thermofluid-thermomechanical model included all
modes of thermofluid flow and heat transfer, as well as the material

18

and geometrical non-linearities. Moreover, experimentally deter-
mined material models, including the rate independent elasto-
plastic material behaviour and the temperature, time and stress
dependent creep strain were implemented. The experimental
validation of the 18 h transient heating-up of the Julich SOFC sys-
tem was demonstrated. Thermomechanically critical
locations
within the demonstrated system were determined and the baffle
plates were determined to affect the hermeticity of the fuel cell
system.

In 2013, two studies of Peksen were published. The first one
utilising a full scale 6 layer SOFC short stack demonstrated a full
cycle coupled thermofluid-thermomechanical behaviour [53]. The
model included all components of an SOFC including the sealant
materials. The thermomechanical behaviour of the stack has been
found to be steered by the deformation behaviour of the metal
components. It has been shown that the local temperature differ-
ence during the important initial stages of the cooling phase has
more impact on the thermomechanically induced stress compared
to the thermal expansion coefficient, which were compared for a
specified location of the predicted results intensively.

The latter study compared the thermomechanical behaviour of
SOFC stacks operating in system and furnace environment [51]. The
same full scale short stack was utilised with an extended furnace
domain to accurately predict the thermal radiation of the furnace.
The model has been validated using experimentally determined
creep strain data. The most important outcome was that the long-
term creep strain behaviour after 1000 h resulted in higher defor-
mation within the steel components whilst reducing stress within
the steel. However, this pulled the joined sealant material and
tensile stresses arose. The use of higher creep resistant steel com-
ponents was suggested.

In 2014, Pengfei Fa et al. [114] introduced a half single unit solid
oxide fuel cell model to investigate the effects of temperature
profile, electrodes and electrolyte thickness, and coefficients of
thermal expansion (CTEs) mismatch between electrolyte, anode,
cathode and interconnector plates. Their findings show that the
chemical reduction of NiO to Ni in the porous anode lowered the
absolute stress level in the MEA structure by 20%. The large tensile
stresses in the anode and the large compressive stresses in the
electrolyte component relaxed partly when the SOFC operated at
high temperatures.

6. Concluding remarks

The solid oxide fuel cell technology has been developing
tremendously and the commercial use has started to be seen all
over the world. Significant research has been performed to
improve the understanding and knowledge of the unique SOFC
features, as to compare and compete with traditional energy
conversion technologies. During the past decade, an increasing
interest in the thermomechanical behaviour of SOFCs has been
remarkable. Technological challenges like hermeticity issues and
degradation has been a motivation for increasing the synergy of
experimental studies and numerical modelling activities within
these complex phenomena. The overview of the numerically
solved thermomechanical SOFC model evolution reveals that
many researchers have focused on the development and use of
numerically solved models with the aid to understand the ther-
momechanical behaviour within solid oxide fuel cells and to in-
crease their thermomechanical reliability. The evolution of the
modelling development has been remarkable so far. The
geometrical representation level of the fuel cell components has
increased. The progress in the advanced material models, as well
as the non-linear models has increased the knowledge about the
thermomechanical processes present in SOFCs. However, there

are some important points for the practical use of future ther-
momechanical modelling within SOFCs and SOFC systems that
needs to be discussed.

important aspects of
modelling of SOFCs. As SOFCs are operating at high temperatures,
the used material properties need to be implemented as tem-
perature dependent, as this affects the overall thermomechanical
behaviour. In most of the studies, thermal analyses still focus on
electrochemical and chemically reacting thermofluid flow, omit-
ting thermal radiation. As thermal radiation with and without
participating gases has a significant effect on the thermal behav-
iour, this requires attention, particular at high temperatures. The
attempt on using coupled thermofluid-thermomechanical ana-
lyses needs to be increased, as the fuel cell nature is based on
multiphysics, occurring simultaneously. Thermomechanical in-
formation should be gathered through a complete analysis rather
than obtaining limited information, relying on thermal gradient
results, as this is a partial information omitting the mechanical
strain component of the thermomechanical description. The ac-
curate description of the physical model is also a missing issue.
The importance of 3D analyses for structural analyses associated
with the geometrical non-linearities and effect on stiffness needs
more consideration. This is very important as 2D analyses are
limited by the accurate representation of the geometrical features
and loads in a plane, which is for SOFC components only for local
investigations valid. The level of geometrical simplifications re-
quires more care, as this influences directly the stiffness of the
component, thus the result will be affected, significantly. The
criteria of geometrical simplification should not be limited to the
thermofluid analysis, as geometrical aspects have a direct impact
on the structural behaviour. The use of full stack analyses is of
thermofluid flow
paramount
behaviour is a function of thermal mass and the mechanical
response is again a function of the constraints present among the
participating components. The use of non-linear material models
is very limited. As experimental studies regarding material
behaviour are increasingly published, analyses in the future
should consider non-linear rate independent models as well as
rate, temperature and stress dependent creep strain models. The
evaluation of the thermomechanical predictions need to be done
using experimental data and post-mortem investigation, leakage
tests, x-ray diffraction etc. Further research is required in imple-
menting model boundary conditions from stack analyses or ex-
periments into the used micro models. As the fuel cell operates
within a system, the researchers are highly encouraged to develop
high-end thermomechanical models, investigating whole fuel cell
systems in 3D. This will determine the thermomechanical in-
teractions among the fuel cell and auxiliary components, each
having different multiphysics and geometrical details. Despite the
tremendous evolution of the numerical modelling activities over
the past years, immense research opportunities are still present in
the large field of the solid oxide fuel cell technology. More
advanced models are expected to be developed within the future
together with the improving computational resources to assist
and develop the technology further.
