    "question_text": "How does the Thermal Annealing process affect char reactivity during coal combustion? Explain the structural changes occurring at each stage and their impact on heterogeneous reaction kinetics.",
    "standard_answer": "Thermal annealing significantly reduces char reactivity through structural reorganization in four distinct stages: Stage 1 (<700°C) involves release of aromatic CH groups, reducing hydrogen content while maintaining small (<1nm) basic structural units (BSUs). Stage 2 (700-1500°C) sees BSUs coalescing face-to-face into distorted columns as heteroatoms release. Stage 3 (1500-2000°C) involves disappearance of misoriented BSUs and edge-to-edge connection of layers. Stage 4 (>2000°C) results in perfect graphite-like structures. These structural changes decrease reactivity through: 1) Reduction in specific surface area as small pores collapse, 2) Destruction of active sites where reactions occur, and 3) Formation of thermally stable graphitic structures. The reactivity decreases follow Arrhenius behavior with activation energies typically 160-400 kJ/mol for desorption steps. The relative reactivity of CHAR-H:CHAR-C:CHAR-G species is approximately 40:20:1 at 1173K.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The thermal annealing hinders the reactivity of char during oxidation and gasification because of the collapse of pores, which diminishes the surface area available for the heterogeneous reactions.",
      "2": "Stage 1 (<700°C): The individual scattering domains [basic structural units (BSUs)] are less than 1 nm in diameter and are isometric. They are also about 1 nm thick with 1 to 3 layers."

    "question_text": "Compare the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism versus nth-order global kinetics for char oxidation, highlighting under what conditions each approach is most appropriate.",
    "standard_answer": "The Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism better captures adsorption/desorption physics through active site theory: Cf + O2→C(O) + O (k1); Cf + O→C(O) (k2); C(O)→CO (k3). This gives rate R = k3θ = k1k3PO2/(k1PO2 + k3). LH excels when: 1) Temperature varies widely (showing variable reaction orders), 2) High pressures where adsorption saturation occurs, 3) Detailed product selectivity (CO/CO2 ratio) is needed. The apparent order shifts from 1 (low T, O2-complex control) to 0 (moderate T, desorption control) to 1 again (high T, adsorption control). In contrast, nth-order kinetics R = kc(T)C_s^n are simpler but only valid over limited conditions. They're useful for: 1) High-temperature Zone III combustion where film diffusion dominates, 2) Quick engineering estimates, 3) Cases where surface area evolution is empirically accounted for.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The classic Langmuir-Hinshelwood model can be slightly adjusted for char oxidation, dividing adsorption into two steps: Cf + O2→C(O) + O k1; Cf + O→C(O) k2; C(O)→CO k3",

Characterization involves solving linear equations balancing atomic masses: α·ω_C^RC1 + β·ω_C^RC2 + γ·ω_C^RC3 = ω_C^Sample (carbon balance); α·ω_H^RC1 + β·ω_H^RC2 + γ·ω_H^RC3 = ω_H^Sample (hydrogen balance); α·ω_O^RC1 + β·ω_O^RC2 + γ·ω_O^RC3 = ω_O^Sample (oxygen balance). For example, German anthracite (85.23%C, 3.03%H, 3.31%O) is characterized as 14.79% COAL-1, 43.83% COAL-2, and 41.38% CHAR-C. The model accounts for metaplastic species formation through competing pathways: low-T decomposition (R1: COAL-1→5 CHAR-H + 0.1 CHAR-C + volatiles) versus high-T depolymerization (R3: COAL-1→G{TAR-1}).",

    "standard_answer": "Char conversion exhibits three distinct regimes: Zone I (kinetic control, Da<<1) occurs at T<900K where chemical kinetics dominate (η≈1). The Damköhler number Da_I = k_vR_p^2/D_eff < 0.1. Zone II (pore diffusion control, Da≈1) at 900-1400K shows decreasing η as φ increases from 0.3-3. The apparent reaction order becomes n_app = (n+1)/2. Zone III (film diffusion control, Da>>1) occurs at T>1400K where external mass transfer dominates (η≈3/φ). The critical particle size separating regimes scales as d_p,crit ∝ (D_eff/k_v)^(1/2). For typical conditions: sub-50μm particles remain in Zone I up to 1500K, while 100μm particles enter Zone II by 900K. The transition to Zone III occurs when Sh≈2 (Sh = k_gd_p/D_m) where k_g is film transfer coefficient. In Zone III, the ash layer forms an additional resistance δ_ash obeying 1/k_obs = 1/k_g + δ_ash/D_ash.",
