Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier and feedstock alike for decarbonizing the energy, transport, and chemical 
sector and mitigating the effects of global warming. Identifying and realizing environmentally friendly hydrogen 
production  pathways  is,  however,  significantly  impeded  by the  need  for  step-wise  transformation  of  national 
energy  systems.  This  paper  reviews  the  current  level  of  hydrogen  production  technology  development.  Nine 
process configurations based on four different process technologies were considered comprising steam methane 
reforming,  steam  methane  reforming  with  carbon  capture  and  storage,  methane  pyrolysis  and  polymer  elec-
trolyte membrane electrolysis. Hydrogen from these technologies is often associated with the respective colors 
grey, blue, turquoise, and green. The critical comparison of the technologies is objectified and quantified based 
on  the  methodology  of  life  cycle  assessment.  For  this  purpose,  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  hydrogen 
production technologies are gathered and the most promising solutions with respect to the progressing energy 
transition identified thereby differentiating the approaches for their short, medium-, and long-term benefit. By 
considering sixteen impact categories, both, environmental co-benefits and burden shifting resulting from the 
transition  to  more  climate-friendly  hydrogen  production  technologies  were  taken  into  account.  The  environ-
mental  impact  of  the  hydrogen  production  technologies  was  found  to  be  determined  to  large  extend  by  the 
underlying electricity and natural gas supply chains. Anticipating technology shifts and taking regional differ-
ences  and  future  advances  in  national  supply  chains  into  account,  technology  recommendations  deviate  sub-
stantially for the countries considered.   

1. Introduction 

One  key  strategy  to  slow  global  warming  and  mitigate  harmful 
environmental effects comprises reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
sions by substituting fossil carbon-based energy sources and commod-
ities with renewable carbon-free resources [1,2]. A promising approach 
for  this  so-called  decarbonization  [3]  is  utilizing  hydrogen  in 
energy-intensive  industrial  sectors  such  as  the  energy,  transport,  and 

chemical sector [4,5]. Global hydrogen use was about 120 Mt/a in 2020 
[6] and is expected to rise to 530 Mt/a in 2050 [7]. More than 70 Mt/a of 
hydrogen are used for oil refining (39 Mt/a) and ammonia production 
(32  Mt/a).  In  addition,  around  50  Mt/a  of  hydrogen  are  used  in 
carbon-containing  gas  mixtures,  syngas,  for  methanol  production  (14 
Mt/a) and steel manufacturing (5 Mt/a) as well as for electricity and 
heat generation (30 Mt/a) [6,8]. 

Hydrogen  may  be  produced  from  a  variety  of  technologies  and

resources, of which many are regarded as renewable (Fig. 1). Current 
hydrogen  production,  however,  is  far  from  being  renewable;  it  relies 
almost  entirely  on  reforming  and  gasification  of  fossil  hydrocarbon 
sources, such as natural gas (76%) and coal (23%) resulting in 830 Mt/a 
CO2  emissions [8]. Alternative hydrogen production technologies such 
as  methane  pyrolysis  [9–11]  and  water  electrolysis  [12–14]  are 
emerging  to  the  forefront.  These  constitute  viable  technologies  for 
reducing the environmental impact, yet only, if energy and raw mate-
rials  are  largely  supplied  from  renewable  sources  [15].  Exploitable 
renewable energy sources (RES) include wind and solar energy, biomass, 
hydropower, as well as tidal, geothermal and wave energy. There is an 
enormous global potential of these sources [7] that far exceeds the entire 
worldwide energy demand [16]. Nevertheless, only part of this potential 
is  accessible  for  exploitation  due  to  geographic,  social,  and  technical 
constraints [17]. Moreover, manifold technologies compete for renew-
able energy and raw material supplies promising to provide ready access 
to these resources. 

Many of the processes for hydrogen production, such as water elec-
trolysis  are  best  run  both  in  continuous  operation  and  for  extended 
operating  hours  to  be  economically  competitive  to  conventional 
hydrogen  production  [18].  However,  most  RES  for  generating  elec-
tricity, such as wind energy and solar radiation, are intrinsically char-
acterized by high volatility [19]. Whereas conventional industrial plants 
are commonly operated in steady state for up to 8,000 hours on-stream 
time  per  year  [20],  wind  and  photovoltaic  power  plants  intrinsically 
have  to adjust to the availability  of the underlying natural resources. 
Wind turbines do not produce electricity during wind lulls, while pho-
tovoltaics does not provide electricity during the night. In 2018, global 
average capacity factors of onshore and offshore wind power plants and 
photovoltaics accounted for 34%, 43%, and 18%, respectively [21]. This 
corresponds  to  2978,  3667  and  1577  full  load  hours.  Consequently, 

hydrogen  production  often  cannot  rely  exclusively  on  RES  exploited 
on-site, but rather needs to be built on the electricity grid mix at the 
respective production site during a particular time. 

Hence, to decarbonize the industrial sectors, the share of RES in the 
electricity grid mix needs to be bolstered by expanding both renewable 
electricity  generation  and  storage  capacities  [22–24].  During  the  last 
decade, many countries have significantly increased the share of RES in 
their respective electricity grid mix and have set ambitious targets to 
augment this share further [25]. Even so, energy system transformations 
involve  multi-step  long-lasting  transitions  that  cannot  occur  abruptly 
[26,27]. The time-frame required for the energy system transition also 
substantially impedes the implementation of the environmentally least 
harmful pathways for hydrogen production. Even though a particular 
technology  might  be  most  preferable  in  the  far  future,  it  may  cause 
significant  environmental  effects  nowadays  within  the  current  frame-
work. Short-term feasible processes, so-called “bridging technologies”, 
may offer near- and middle-term solutions until the long-term solution 
can be realized [9,28]. Such bridging technologies may help to reduce 
GHG  emissions  with  immediate  effect  and  support  in  advancing  the 
development of a suitable hydrogen infrastructure, which ultimately can 
be used for deploying the optimal long-term sustainable solution [29]. 
Previous studies focused mostly on assessing the environmental im-
pacts of present-day hydrogen production [30,31] and comparison with 
specific future scenarios [32–34]. The energy demand was considered to 
be met entirely from RES [35–38] or the particular energy mix charac-
teristic for a certain region during a specific time interval [39–41]. 

This  study  focusses  on  assessing  the  relation  between  the  trans-
forming  energy  systems  and  the  environmental  impact  of  hydrogen 
production  technologies.  The  current  state  of  hydrogen  production  is 
reviewed  with  focus  on  four  different  hydrogen  production  technolo-
gies,  i.e.,  steam  methane  reforming  (SMR),  steam  methane  reforming

with  carbon  capture  and  storage  (SMR-CCS), methane  pyrolysis  (MP) 
and  polymer  electrolyte  membrane  electrolysis  (PEMEL).  Hydrogen 
from  these  technologies  is  often  associated  with  the  respective  colors 
grey,  blue,  turquoise,  and  green  (Fig.  2).  Then,  the  environmental 
impact of hydrogen production based on these technologies is compar-
atively  assessed.  The  review  serves  to  identify  and  obtain  reliable, 
verified process data for each of the hydrogen production technologies 
considered. These data are then harmonized with regard to the inves-
tigated  system  boundaries  and  functional  units and  set  into  the  same 
context, the so-called background system. By comparing the present and 
projected environmental impact of hydrogen production technologies, 
we aim to answer the following questions:  

-  How  sensitive  are  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  respective 
hydrogen production technology with regard to the energy system 
transformation?  

-  Which  hydrogen  production  technology  will  be  environmentally 

most favorable in the long run? 

environmental  impact  of  hydrogen  production  in  a  reasonable  time 
frame. Consequently, this study is focused on technologies that are likely 
to  be  suitable  for  large-scale  production  of  hydrogen  in  the  near  to 
medium-term future. The selected technologies rely on feedstocks with 
an existing large-scale distribution network, i.e. natural gas and water, 
and are preferentially characterized by a high technology readiness level 
(TRL). Furthermore, the hydrogen production technologies are selected 
to comprise one example for each of the hydrogen colors: (i) hydrogen 
obtained by steam methane reforming (“grey”), (ii) hydrogen obtained 
by  SMR  with  carbon  capture  and  storage  (“blue”),  (iii)  hydrogen  ob-
tained by methane pyrolysis (“turquoise”), and (iv) hydrogen obtained 
by polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (“green”). Table 1 
schematically  summarizes  the  considered  hydrogen  production  tech-
nologies with their respective technology readiness level (TRL), primary 
feedstock,  and  process-related  CO2  emissions.  Each  considered  tech-
nology  is  associated  with  one  of  the  four  hydrogen  colors.  A  more 
detailed  definition  of  the  respective  technology  is  given  in  the  first 
paragraph of the corresponding technical section. 

- Which role will bridging technologies play in promoting the transi-
tion  from  conventional  to  sustainable  hydrogen  production 
technologies? 

The  following  section  reviews  the  current  state  and  future  de-
velopments  of  the  four  hydrogen  production  technologies  and  nine 
process configurations considered for this study. 

- When and under what circumstances does a certain hydrogen pro-
duction technology evolve to be the environmentally most favorable 
option? 

We will show that electricity production that is based on RES and 
supply chains that are compatible with a circular economy are decisive 
factors  that  determine  the  environmental  impact  of  a  particular 
hydrogen production technology. 

2. Hydrogen Production 

Hydrogen  production  technologies  differ  regarding  the  state  of 
development,  the  required  feedstock  and  resources  (natural  gas,  oil, 
coal, biomass, water), and the associated GHG emissions. Conventional, 
low-CO2, CO2-free, and carbon-free production routes are often referred 
to by the color terms “grey”, “blue”, “turquoise”, and “green” as illus-
trated in Fig. 2 [42]. 

In a prospective hydrogen economy, industrial scale processes will be 
needed  to  match  the  high  demand  of  hydrogen  and  reduce  the

rization according to the primary feedstock, their respective technology readi-

2.1. Steam methane reforming 

Steam  reforming  (SMR)  is  the  most  frequently  applied  process  to 
produce hydrogen today [8]. Consequently, steam reforming was chosen 
as  benchmark  for  this  study.  Currently,  steam  reforming  is  based  on 
fossil resources and is related to substantial process-related CO2  emis-
sions. With present-day annual emissions of about 530 Mt/a, this process 
considerably contributes to climate change [8]. Hydrogen from steam 
reforming is often referred to as conventional or grey H2 [42]. 

2.1.1. Process description 

◦

Fossil hydrocarbons are catalytically cracked into carbon monoxide 
(CO) and hydrogen (H2) in the presence of steam (H2O) at temperatures 
of 700–900 
C [43] and pressures of 3-35 bar [4,44]. Typical hetero-
geneous  catalysts  are  nickel  (Ni)  [45]  and  precious  metal  alloys  like 
Ni/Al2O3  [46,47] or Ru/ZrO2  [48]. On industrial scale, natural gas is 
commonly  used  as  hydrocarbon  feedstock.  With  a  molar  fraction  of 
75–99%,  methane  (CH4)  is  the  main  constituent  of  natural  gas  [49]. 
Consequently,  this  process  is  often  referred  to  as  steam  methane 
reforming (SMR) [50]. The primary process steps of SMR are depicted in 
Fig. 3. 

Apart  from  methane,  natural  gas  consists  of  varying  amounts  of 
higher  alkanes  (ethane,  propane,  butane),  inert  gases  (nitrogen,  heli-
um), as well as acidic, so-called “sour” gases (mostly carbon dioxide and 
hydrogen sulfide) [49]. As component of the feed for downstream pro-
cesses,  hydrogen  sulfide  (H2S)  shows  particularly  adverse  effects, 
because sulfur compounds cause catalyst poisoning by chemisorption to 
metal centers on the active surface of catalysts [51]. Hence, H2S must be 
removed from the hydrocarbon feed [52]. Commonly, H2S is removed 
by hydrotreating or absorption on activated zinc oxide [45] 

After suitable pre-treatment of the feed, the steam reforming step is 
initiated. The chemical equation of the conversion of hydrocarbons in 
general  and,  specifically,  of  methane  is  given  in  Eq.  1  and  2,  respec-
tively. This step is strongly endothermic and, thus, demands a substan-
tial external heat supply [50]. Heat is introduced into the system in form 
of  steam and/or by externally heating the reactor.  Common fuels are 
natural gas and off-gases from hydrogen purification [4]. Additionally, 
heat  from  the  exothermic  water-gas  shift  (WGS)  reaction  (Eq.  3),  the 
subsequent process step in SMR, can be integrated [50].

The reforming step yields a hydrogen stream that contains more than 
10 vol-% CO [48]. By means of the WGS, CO and H2O are converted to 
CO2  and H2,  thereby further increasing the hydrogen yield. There are 
two particular WGS concepts which differ from one another with respect 
to  the  temperature  range  and  catalyst  concept.  The  high-temperature 
shift takes place at temperatures of 310–500 
C and pressures of 25-35 
catalysts.  The

low-temperature shift is performed at temperatures of 190–280 
C via 
CuO/ZnO [53] or brass [48] catalysts. Usually, both concepts are carried 
out in a two-stage reactor. Downstream of the two-step WGS the content 
of  residual  carbon  oxides  in  the  product  stream  has  decreased  to 
approximately  1%  [48].  To  produce  pure  H2,  final  purification  steps 
may  be  necessary.  Depending  on  the  application  field,  such  methods 
include  freezing,  gas  scrubbers,  methanization,  selective  catalytic 
oxidation,  pressure  swing  absorption  (PSA),  storage  in  hydrides  and 
membrane diffusion [4,44,45]. 

The  performance  of  SMR  is  increased  through  applying  high  tem-
peratures, and low pressures according to Le Chatelier´s principle, as well 
as addition of excess steam to avoid coke formation [44]. The latter is 
expressed by the steam-to-carbon ratio. Common ratios are between 2 
[50] and 5 [43,44], whereas ratios between 2.5 [45] and 3.5 [50] are 
often considered to be an optimal value in terms of purified H2  yield, 
efficiency,  and  plant  dimensions.  Further  developments  of  SMR  are 
specifically  aimed  at  improving  the  energy  efficiency  of  steam  pre-
heating in order to minimize fuel consumption and improve the outlet 
temperature of the reformer [55]. SMR is a mature and well-established 
technology (TRL 9) [44,47]. The largest plants have production capac-
ities  of  up  to  120,000  Nm3/h  H2  and  are  operated  for  downstream 
production  of  ammonia  (NH3)  [56].  The  overall  process  efficiency  of 
SMR on a higher heating value (HHV) basis is about 65–70% [57,58]. 

2.1.2. By-product steam 

Excess heat generated as steam [59] from both the convective section 
of the flue gas and intermediate cooling of the product stream may be 
used for supplying nearby industrial plants or for generating electricity 
in steam turbines. The practical process efficiency limit of SMR is esti-
mated to be 88.9–90.7% on a HHV basis [59]. 

2.2. Steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage 

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are promising ways 
to reduce process-related CO2  emissions and enable the production of 
low-CO2  hydrogen. The SMR-CCS approach is based on the same pro-
duction  process  and  fossil  resources  as  grey  H2  from  SMR. Instead  of 
releasing it into the atmosphere, most of the arising CO2 is sequestered 
and stored in geologic sites. Since most of the direct CO2 emissions are 
thus avoided, H2 produced from SMR-CCS is often referred to as low-CO2 
or blue H2, yet only, if the captured CO2 is stored permanently [42]. 

2.2.1. Process description 

Depending on the CO2  sequestration technology, one distinguishes 
between  pre-,  post-,  and  oxyfuel  combustion.  In  the  case  of  pre- 
combustion, the carbon contained in the fuel is converted in upstream 
processing  to  CO2.  The  CO2  by-product  is  then  captured  prior  to  the 
combustion  process.  The  CO2  is  separated  from  the  feed  gases  by 
physicochemical  absorption  of  CO2  into  aqueous  washing  solutions 
containing  amines  such  as  2-aminoethan-1-ol  (monoethanolamine, 
MEA), or physical absorption into polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether at 
slightly  elevated  pressures  (selexol™),  cold  methanol  (rectisol™),  or 
other solvents [60,61]. By contrast, post-combustion is characterized by

the  sequestration  of  CO2  from  the  flue  gas  stream  in  a  downstream 
process.  Suitable  technologies  are  absorption  by  MEA,  adsorption  on 
solid sorbents such as porous organic structures, cryogenic separation, 
and  pressure  swing  adsorption  (PSA)  [62,63].  Oxyfuel  combustion  is 
applied on an industrial scale during the combustion processes. Thereby, 
pure oxygen is used for combustion to obtain a CO2-enriched flue gas 
stream, which simplifies the sequestration of CO2 [62]. 

In the case of hydrogen production by SMR, CO2 may be captured at 
three different steps along the process chain (Fig. 4). The options include 
CO2 removal from (1) the shifted syngas, (2) the tail gas, or (3) the flue 
gas stream [64].  

(1)  Pre-combustion CO2 capture from the shifted syngas by chemical 
absorption  with  aqueous  methyldiethanolamine  (MDEA)  solu-
tions  is the state-of-the-art technology for SMR-CCS due to the 
high partial pressure of CO2 in the syngas stream at this point of 
the process chain (16 vol-% CO2 at 25 bar) [66].  

(2)  On  the  contrary,  capturing  CO2  from  the  tail  gas  is  often 
considered economically disadvantageous due to the lower par-
tial pressure of CO2 in the tail gas stream (51 vol-% at 2 bar) [66], 
although this option is likewise explored further [65].  

(3)  For  post-combustion CO2  capture from the flue  gas stream  (21 
vol-%  CO2  at  1  bar)  [66],  chemical  absorption  using  MEA 
scrubbing predominates [35,67,68]. In chemical absorption, the 
gas  stream  is  brought  into  contact  with  a  solvent,  commonly 
aqueous MEA or MDEA, in an absorption column, separating CO2 
from the gas stream. The loaded solvent is then regenerated by 
means of heating in a stripper unit, whereby the CO2 is released 
for  further  utilization.  A  make-up  stream  of  the  solvent  is 
required to account for evaporation losses and degradation [67]. 

Capture  efficiencies  range  from  53  to  95%,  and  can  be  increased 
albeit on expense of higher energy demands [35,67–69]. It should be 
noted  that  the  SMR  plant  efficiencies  are  reduced  by  5–14%  upon 
implementing CCS [63]. 

In  addition  to  sequestration  of  CO2,  CCS  comprises  transport  via 
pipeline,  ship  or  other  means  to  long-term  storage  sites  in  geologic 
formations [70]. The implementation of CCS to a great extend necessi-
tates the build-up of a suitable transport infrastructure [69]. To increase 
the  transport  density  of  CO2  to  a  technically  manageable  level, 
compression,  liquefaction,  or  solidification  of  CO2  is  required.  At 
◦
ambient temperatures (20
C) CO2  becomes a liquid at 57.28 bar [71]. 
◦
The critical point is at 31.04 
C and 73.83 bar [71]. At ambient pressure 
(1 bar), CO2 solidifies at -78,46 

C [71]. 
Carbon dioxide may be transported as compressed gas or in liquid, 
supercritical  or  solid  state.  Pipes  are  the  most  efficient  way  of  trans-
porting CO2. CO2-pipelines are operated typically at pressures of 110 bar 
transporting CO2 as supercritical fluid. Liquefaction requires significant 

◦

energy input of 0.11 kWh/kg CO2 [72]. For specific purposes, CO2 may 
also be stored in solid form as dry ice. This option has a high energy 
C 
demand that is required to cool CO2  to temperatures below -78.00 
[71]. 

◦

For temporary storage of large quantities of CO2, physical storage in 
salt caverns is suitable [63]. For long-term sequestration, however, CO2 
needs to be transferred to suitable geological formations such as aqui-
fers, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, or coal bed formations [73]. For this 
purpose, CO2 is compressed and introduced into the geologic site typi-
cally  under supercritical  conditions [68].  A  monitoring  project at  the 
Williston Basin, a geological structure in Canada and the United States, 
performed by the IEAGHG research program between 2000 and 2012 
did not give rise to any signs of CO2 leakage from the geological reser-
voir  [74]. Annual  leakage  rates of 0.00001  to 1% have  been  forecast 
depending  strongly  on  the  permeability  of  the  rock  formation  [62]. 
Within  the  geologic  sites,  CO2  gradually  reacts  chemically  with  sur-
rounding rock formations [75,76]. Thus, silicates slowly react with CO2 
to carbonates and silica (eq. 4).

The quantity of CO2  that needs to be stored via CCS to limit global 
◦
warming to 1.5 
C strongly varies among the scenarios developed [77]. 
Globally, estimated annual capture rates in the 21st century range from 
zero to more than 1,200 Gt/a [77]. In Europe, capture rates are esti-
mated  to  be  300  Mt/a  by  2050  [77].  Recent  estimates  of  global  CO2 
storage capacities range from 3,900 to 55,000 Gt CO2  [77,78]. Associ-
ated  hazard  concerns  may  result  in  social  or  legislative  restrictions. 
Taking these restriction into consideration, the CO2 storage capacity in 
Europe is estimated to 134 Gt CO2  [79]. This corresponds to a storage 
capacities that is sufficient for CO2 storage for the next 400 years [70]. 
The first CCS facility started operation in 1972 in the United States as 
part of an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project [80]. In Europe, the first 
plant  that  included  permanent,  dedicated  CO2  storage  was  built  in 
Norway in the Sleipner oil field; it has been operating since 1996 [70]. 
Currently, 26 commercial CCS facilities are operating worldwide, which 
have a total annual CO2 capture capacity of 40 Mt/a [81]. Among them, 
six facilities are used for dedicated geological storage; the remaining 20 
plants provide CO2 for EOR operations to generate revenue [81]. Apart 
from this, 34 pilot and demonstration plants are in operation or devel-
opment [81]. Thus, SMR-CCS has been verified on an industrial scale 
(TRL 8-9) [70]. 

2.3. Methane pyrolysis 

In methane pyrolysis (MP), also referred to as methane “decompo-
sition”  and  methane  cracking,  CH4  is  cleaved  into  gaseous  H2  and 
elemental carbon (C) [82,83].

As in the case of SMR, considerable amounts of CH4, supplied mostly 
in form of natural gas and, thus, a fossil hydrocarbon source, are used 
here.  In  fact,  even  higher  amounts  of  CH4  are  required  for  hydrogen 
production by MP, by considering that the molar ratio of H2  to CH4  is 
2:1,  compared  to  4:1  for  SMR.  Nevertheless, from  MP,  no  direct  CO2 
emissions arise. Consequently, H2 from MP is often referred to as CO2- 
free or “turquoise” H2 [42]. MP is considered a possible bridging tech-
nology for climate-friendly hydrogen production [9]. 

2.3.1. Process description 

As depicted in Fig. 5, the primary process steps of MP comprise (1) 
the cleavage of methane into gaseous hydrogen and solid carbon, (2) the 
removal of the solid carbon from the gas stream, e.g. through a filter or 
cyclone system, and (3) the purification of the gas stream, mainly by 
means of PSA or a membrane. 

There is considerable ongoing research on reaction mechanism, ki-
netics,  and  optimal  catalyst  choice  for  MP  that  aim  at  developing  a 
scalable process concept [84]. A variety of reactor concepts have been 
proposed,  including  plasma  [85–87],  packed  bed  [88],  (circulating) 
fluidized bed [89–91], monolithic [92,93], liquid bubble column [82, 
94–99],  and moving bed reactors [10]. So  far most of these concepts 
have been explored on a laboratory scale (TRL 3–4) [10]. 

Common challenges that need to be overcome for scale-up of MP to 
commercial H2 production are: (1) supplying the significant demand for 
heat to obtain reasonable space-time-yields, (2) handling the deposition 
of solid carbon on the surface of the catalyst and inside of the reactor, (3) 
using natural gas instead of pure methane as a feedstock including the 
impact of the gas composition on process performance and product gas 
purity, and (4) further treating and commercially exploiting the solid 
carbon [10]. 

◦

As CH4 is chemically highly stable, high temperatures are necessary 
to for methane pyrolysis [100]. Thermal (non-catalytic), catalytic, and 
plasma-based  process  concepts  have  been  investigated  (Fig.  6).  The 
thermal,  non-catalytic  conversion  of  methane  occurs  at  temperatures 
above  700 
C  [101].  By  using  a  suitable  catalyst,  the  conversion  of 
methane can be triggered already at lower temperatures of > 500 
C 
[26]. The higher the temperature, the higher the obtained reaction rates 
and product yields [83,102]. For realizing reasonable space-time-yields, 
temperatures of above 800 
C for non-catalytic, 
and up to 2000 
C for plasma-based processes [10,103,104] are antici-
pated for industrial-scale applications.

2.3.2. Catalyst design 

Metal catalysts based primarily on nickel [105–107], iron [108,109], 
and cobalt [110,111], as well as carbonaceous materials [89,112–115], 
and  molten  media  [96–99,116]  have  been  tested  for  increasing  CH4 
conversion  and  H2  selectivity  at  moderate  temperatures.  Among  the 
metals tested, nickel showed the highest catalytic activities [117,118], 
followed by cobalt, and iron [119]. Nickel-based catalysts, in particular, 
suffer  from  rapid  deactivation  due  to  carbon  accumulation  on  the 

catalyst surface [120–122]. The deposition of solid carbon on the active 
sites  of the  catalysts  and  within  the reactor  results  in catalyst  deacti-
vation [123], decline in heat transfer [124], as well as reactor clogging 
[102,125].  This  progressively  interrupts  the  reaction  and  leads  to  a 
decline in H2 yield. Thus, the catalyst must be regenerated periodically 
[84].  Suitable  methods  are  carbon  oxidation  and  steam  gasification 
which, however, cause the undesired formation of CO2  and contradict 
the  purpose  of  producing  CO2-free  hydrogen  [95,102,116].  Further-
more,  nickel-based  catalysts  are  relatively  expensive  [126],  and  the 
carbon  by-product  may  contain  catalyst  residues  [84].  Cobalt-based 
catalysts,  showing  a  lower  activity  than  nickel-based  catalysts  [111, 
127],  are  even  more  expensive  [102],  and  their  use  likewise  raises 
toxicity  concerns  [106,128].  By  contrast,  Iron-based  catalysts  have 
displayed higher resistance to carbon accumulation [129,130], and lead 
to  lower  costs  [126]  and  environmental  issues  [131,132].  However, 
iron-based catalysts are less active and provide limited conversion rates 
at moderate temperatures [127]. 

Catalysts based on carbonaceous materials such as activated carbon 
[133], carbon black [134], or graphite [135] combine many desirable 
characteristics for use in MP, including resistance to high temperatures 
[100,136], low costs [113], non-toxicity [84], and tolerance to impu-
rities such as sulfur compounds [114]. Furthermore, there is no need for 
regenerating the carbon catalyst [113], thereby avoiding the undesired 
formation of CO2. Nevertheless, carbon catalysts commonly show lower 
activities  than  metal  catalysts,  necessitating  considerably  higher  tem-
peratures to achieve reasonable H2 yields [137]. 

Moreover,  certain  metals  (Ti,  Pb,  Sn)  [82,83,94,95],  metal  alloys 
(Ni-Bi, Cu-Bi) [98,99], and salts (KBr, NaBr, NaCl, NaF, MnCl2, KCl) [96, 
97] have been proposed for catalyzing the thermal cleavage of CH4  in 
form  of  molten  media  [116].  For  this,  CH4  is  entrained  in  a  bubble 
column reactor filled with the molten medium. The gaseous CH4 forms 
bubbles,  which  are  buoyed  according  to  Archimedes´ principle.  The 
cleavage  of  CH4  occurs  at  the  surface  of  the  bubble,  respectively  the 
phase boundary of the gas and the molten medium. Since two moles of 
gaseous H2 are formed for each mole of CH4, the volume of the bubbles 
increases, leading to an increasing buoyant force. The bubbles rise faster 
until  they  burst  open  at  the  surface.  Gaseous  H2  and  remaining  CH4 
escape upwards and the solid carbon separates from the molten medium 
and  floats  on  the  surface  [116,125],  where  it  can  be  removed  and 
collected [95]. Effective heat transfer occurs between the molten me-
dium  and  the  entrained  CH4  that  leads  to  constant  recurrence  of  gas 
bubbles  and  prevents  the  deposition  of  carbon  on  the  catalyst  [138]. 
Liquid tin turned out to be a suitable heat transfer medium, because it 
allows for operation temperatures of more than 1,200 

C [95,125]. 

◦

Carbon particles, carried out with the gas stream, are removed by 
means of a filter system. Subsequently, unconverted CH4  is separated 
from the product gas stream by PSA or metallic membranes and recycled 
into the reactor [9,125,139]. The H2 product stream is very pure and can 
be  used  directly  for  its  intended  purpose  without  further  treatment. 
Tests of this technology on a laboratory scale have shown that H2 can be 
produced over many hours without reactor clogging [83,95].

2.3.3. Natural gas as feedstock 

Industrial applications of MP initially involve the use of natural gas. 
At a later stage, methane from biogas plants may likewise be employed 
as feedstock. Only few studies concerned the influence of trace compo-
nents in the feed gas on crucial process parameters such as selectivity, 
product quality and conversion [10,84]. Nickel- and iron-based catalysts 
progressively deactivate by contact with H2S [114]. Small amounts of 
higher alkanes may have no negative, or even a positive effect on CH4 
conversion, and may reduce the deactivation of carbon catalysts [112, 
140]. Consequently, conditioning of the feed may be required. Natural 
gas components other than CH4 can initiate side reactions, causing the 
formation of undesired by-products such as (un)saturated hydrocarbons 
and  (poly)cyclic  aromatic  compounds  [104,141,142].  Consequently, 
purification of the product hydrogen stream may be necessary, when the 
hydrogen is intended for sensitive applications such as use in fuel cells 
and as feedstock in the chemical industry [10]. 

2.3.4. By-product carbon 

On a mass basis, MP yields a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of 1:3, which 
means that only 25% of the product mass attributes to the primary target 
product H2 [10]. Consequently, utilizing the carbon by-product will be 
crucial for economic feasibility as well as environmental performance of 
the process. The carbon by-product of MP is obtained as highly disperse 
elemental  carbon  with  small  particle  sizes,  similar  to  the  currently 
marketed carbon black [143]. Carbon black is used mainly as reinforcing 
filler in tires and other rubber products and as black pigment in plastics, 
paints,  coatings,  and  printing  inks  [125,144].  Smaller  applications 
include  the  manufacturing  of  dry  cells  and  electrodes,  and  the 
improvement  of antistatic and conductive  properties of  polymers and 
resins  [145].  Each  field  of  application  requires  a  different  grade  of 
carbon black with narrow specifications with regard to its physical and 
chemical  properties  [146].  As  in  the  case  of  MP,  carbon  black  is 
conventionally produced  from hydrocarbon feedstocks. Depending  on 
the feedstock and whether the heat is generated externally or internally 
by combusting parts of the feedstock, furnace black, gas black, channel 
black, lamp black, acetylene black, and thermal black are distinguished 
[143]. Among them, the internally heated furnace black process, which 
is based on petrochemical oil and coal tar oil feedstock, is used most 
frequently today due to its wide range of accessible carbon black grades 
and its economic viability [147]. Nevertheless, the other processes are 
likewise used to produce special grades of carbon black that cannot be 
obtained by the furnace black process [143]. The thermal black process 
produces carbon blacks specialized for mechanical rubber goods with 
high  filler  contents.  As  for  the  MP  technology,  natural  gas  is  used  as 
feedstock,  and  heat  is  supplied  externally.  Mostly  due  to  economic 

reasons, industrial plants for the thermal black process by e.g. the US 
company  monolith  materials  have  been  decommissioned  and  produc-
tion has focused on carbon black [147] using the non-purified, H2-rich 
product stream solely for heating purposes [10,143]. 

Consequently,  it  remains  an  open  question  if  MP  is  suitable  for 
producing two economically valuable products at the same time [10,85, 
148]. In principle, the carbon by-product can be used as a substitute for 
conventional  carbon  black.  Nevertheless,  the  usability  of  the  carbon 
by-product  depends  on  the  prevailing  process  concept,  as  the  use  of 
metal catalysts based on cobalt or nickel leads to metal contaminations 
in  the  carbon  by-product  [84].  Moreover,  the  existing  carbon  black 
market has an insufficient size considering the sheer scale of a possible 
future hydrogen production by MP [149–151]. The worldwide annual 
carbon black consumption in 2025 is forecasted to grow beyond 15 Mt/a 
[144]. In comparison, meeting the current annual demand of pure H2 of 
around  70  Mt  [8]  by  MP  would  lead  to  approximately  210  Mt/a  of 
carbon by-product and, thus, exceed the estimated market demand for 
carbon black by a factor of 14. 

The discrepancy between supply and demand grows further, when 
considering the expected increase in H2 demand in the future. Moreover, 
it is unlikely that the entire range of carbon black grades can be pro-
duced solely by MP. Possible new applications may increase the future 
carbon black demand [113,149], but are unlikely in the short- or me-
dium  term  [9,149].  Finally,  a  material  utilization  of  the  carbon 
by-product,  e.g.,  as  filler  in  polymeric  materials,  would  result  in 
renewed CO2-emissions at a later stage of the life cycle. To realize a truly 
CO2-free H2  production by MP, the carbon by-product must be perma-
nently removed from the atmosphere. The sequestration and storage of 
the carbon by-product would be energetically and technically advanta-
geous to SMR-CCS, because the carbon by-product is in a solid state and, 
thus, could be more easily deposited than gaseous CO2 [10]. While this 
type of storage does not contribute to value generation, the use of carbon 
fillers  in  concrete  and  for  other  construction  purposes  may  fulfil  the 
criteria  of  long-term  removal  of  the  carbon  from  the  atmosphere. 
Carbon-reinforced cement could likewise contribute to material savings 
and reduced energy demand [152–154].

relying  on  fossil  resources  nor  causing  any  process  related  GHG 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)1009967M. Hermesmann and T.E. Müller                                                                                                                                                                                                            

emissions. In fact, no carbon feedstock is directly consumed by water 
electrolysis. Consequently, H2 from water electrolysis is often referred to 
as carbon-free or “green” H2 [42]. Nevertheless, a considerable impact 
in  the  category  climate  change  may  arise  from  plant  manufacturing, 
infrastructure development and the underlying supply chains of water 
and electricity. 

2.4.1. Thermodynamic principles 

The  basis  of  water  electrolysis  is  formed  by  the  electrolytic  cell, 
consisting  of  two  electrodes  and  an  ion-conducting  electrolyte  [19]. 
Electricity is supplied in form of a direct current to produce a difference 
in  electric  potential,  i.e.  voltage,  between  the  electrodes  [155].  If  a 
sufficiently  high  voltage  is  applied  to  the  electrolysis  cell,  an  endo-
thermic (ΔHR > 0), non-spontaneous (ΔGR > 0) redox reaction is initi-
ated [156]. Depending on the type of electrolyzer, deionized water is 
electrochemically decomposed to either O2 and positively charged ions 
(cations)  by  oxidation  or  H2  and  negatively charged  ions  (anions)  by 
reduction at one of the electrodes [19]. Subsequently, the ions migrate 
to the other electrode, attracted by its opposite charge. The electrodes 
are named based on the ions they are attracting. Cations migrate to the 
so-called cathode, whereas anions migrate to the anode [157]. At the 
second  electrode,  the  second  part  of  the  redox  reaction  takes  place, 
forming either H2 by reduction at the cathode or O2 by oxidation at the 
anode [14]. 

As depicted in eq. 6, the reaction enthalpy of water splitting (ΔHR) 
can be divided in a thermal part, indicated by entropy change (ΔSR) and 
process temperature (T) and an electrical part, indicated by the change 
in Gibbs free energy (ΔGR) [156,158,159]. According to the first prin-
ciple of thermodynamics, the required amount of electricity to electro-
chemically decompose 1 mole of water is equal to the respective change 
in  Gibbs  free  energy  (eq.  7)  [158].  Consequently,  the  theoretically 
required  voltage  (Uth)  of  a  water  electrolysis  cell  may  be  calculated 
based  on  the  number  of  electrons  that  are  exchanged  per  mole  of 
decomposed  water  (n  = 2)  and  the  Faraday  constant  (F  = 96, 
485C/mol), which quantifies the electrical charge per mole of electrons 
(eq. 7) [158,159]. 

ΔHR = ΔGR + ΔSR × T

ΔGR = Uth × n × F

[160]. If all required process heat is provided externally, this results in a 
minimum, so-called reversible, cell voltage for water splitting of 1.23 V 
[156,158,159].  However,  both  the  electrical  and  the  thermal  energy 
and,  thus,  the  entire  reaction  enthalpy  ΔH0
R  is  commonly  supplied  in 
form of electricity, resulting in a so-called thermo-neutral cell voltage of 
1.48 V  [156,158,159]. It  should be noted that the actual cell voltage 
(Ucell)  is  considerably  higher  in  practice,  due  to  an  cell  overpotential 
resulting from activation losses at the electrodes, mass transport limi-
tations, as well as ohmic resistances [159]. As shown in eq. 8, this ul-
timately  decreases  the  voltage  efficiency  of  the  electrolysis  cell  (ηV) 
defined as ratio of actual and theoretical cell voltage [158].

Depending on the aggregate state at which water is supplied, either 
its lower heating value (LHV) or higher heating value (HHV) is used for 
calculating the voltage efficiency [158]. If liquid water is applied, the 
HHV of water is used. Contrarily, the efficiency of electrolyzers supplied 
by  steam  is  based  on  the  LHV,  as  energy  for  water  evaporation  have 
already  been  supplied  before  the  water  is  fed  to  the  electrolyzer.  It 
should further be distinguished whether the produced H2 is used ener-
getically (LHV) or chemically (HHV) and if the oxygen by-product will 

be further utilized [161]. 

One  further possibility for  calculating the  efficiency of  an electro-
lyzer is the ratio between the energy content of the product H2 based on 
its  HHV  (3.54  kWh/Nm3)  or  LHV  (3.00  kWh/Nm3)  and  the  specific 
electricity  consumption  to  produce  1  Nm3  H2  at  standard  conditions 
(Wel) [161]. By incorporating the energy demand of the entire process 
equipment,  the  efficiency  of  the  overall  H2  production  system  is  ob-
tained (eq. 9).

2.4.2. Electrolysis technologies 

The three most common electrolysis technologies to produce H2 are 
alkaline water electrolysis (AEL) [162], polymer electrolyte membrane 
water  electrolysis  (PEMEL)  [163]  and  high-temperature,  respectively 
solid  oxide  water  electrolysis  (SOEL)  [164].  Electrolysis  technologies 
mainly  differ  in  (1)  stage  of  development,  (2)  electrolyte  and  charge 
carrier, (3) typical operating conditions, and (4) suitability for dynamic 
operation  forced  by  a  discontinuous  power  supply  from  renewable 
power plants [19]. 

There are both advantages and disadvantages for each of the elec-
trolysis technology. AEL is the most developed and commercially rele-
vant electrolysis technology today  [12]. In this study, the  focus is on 
PEMEL,  due  to  its  particular  suitability  for  the  dynamic  operation  in 
accordance with the availability of electricity generated from intermit-
tent renewable energy sources [13,165]. Further promising character-
istics of PEMEL comprise high current densities, compact system design, 
safe high-pressure operation avoiding subsequent compression efforts, 
energy-efficient  stand-by  operation,  short  response,  start-up,  and 
shut-down times, and broad partial load range while maintaining high 
product gas purity [12,159,166,167]. For a more detailed comparison of 
the three electrolysis technologies, including the key parameters as well 
as the main technological advantages and disadvantages, see [19]. 

2.4.3. Process description 

As depicted in Fig. 7, a common PEMEL cell consists of (1) a solid 
polymer  electrolyte,  (2)  two  electrodes,  anode  and  cathode,  with 
precious  metal  catalysts, (3)  two  porous  transport  layers  and  (4) two 
bipolar plates [33,163]. 

A  proton-conducting  membrane  of  highly  porous  polymeric  mate-
rial,  commonly  Nafion™  [163]  or  fumapem™  [166],  is  used  as  elec-
trolyte.  The  porosity  of  the  membrane  (thickness  60  [33]  –200  μm 
[159])  enables  an  improved  current  flow  as  well  as  water  and  gas 
transport. The electrodes (thickness 10 μm [33]) are directly coated on 
the membrane to minimize ohmic resistances [159]. The membrane is 
coated  with  precious  metal  catalysts,  commonly  based  on  iridium 
(anode)  and  platinum  (cathode)  [166,169].  The  surrounding  porous 
transport layers (thickness 280 μm [170]) are made from carbon paper 
(cathode)  and  sintered  titanium  foam  or  felt  (anode).  The  porous 
transport layers are firmly attached to bipolar plates, usually made from 
titanium [159,171]. Engraved flow channels in the plates enable water 
and  product  gas  transport  [161].  In  addition,  the  channels  ensure  a 
harmonized distribution of the current density to ensure that the entire 
area  is  used  equally  for  water  separation  [171].  Multiple  electrolysis 
cells are connected electrically in series to form one single electrolyzer 
stack. Critical, scarce, and expensive materials, i.e. platinum, iridium, 
and titanium, are required, due to their resistance to high potentials at 
the  anode  side  and  the  corrosive  acidic  environment  caused  by  the 
proton conducting ionomer [172]. Current research efforts are striving 
for  (1)  higher  current  densities,  (2)  lower  catalyst  loading,  and  (3) 
savings in critical materials [33]. 

In PEMEL, liquid, deionized water is supplied to the anode side [173, 
174], where the application of voltage initiates the oxidation of water

into  O2  and  protons  (eq.  8).  The  by-product  O2  leaves  the  system  in 
gaseous form. The protons migrate through the membrane to the cath-
ode, where they combine with electrons to form H2 (eq. 9), which is also 
removed in gaseous form [163].

Typical operating conditions of PEMEL are temperatures of 20 [159, 
161] – 150 [55] 
C and pressures of up to 200 bar [163]. So far, elec-
trolyzers with pressures higher than 30 bar have only been tested on a 
small scale [156]. With current densities of up to 4.0 A/cm2 [55] and cell 
voltages of 1.4 [55] –2.2 [161,166] V, the voltage efficiency for PEMEL 
stacks accounts for 67–82% [161,166]. Development of PEMEL started 
in the 1960s [175]. PEMEL electrolyzers are commercially available on 
medium and small scale (TRL 9) [13]. In 2020, the world´s largest plant 
for  green  hydrogen  production by  PEMEL,  based  on  four  5 MW  elec-
trolyzers, began commercial operation in Qu´ebec, Canada [176]. The 
plant has a total capacity of 20 MW, producing about 3,000 t/a of H2 per 
year. Both hydrogen [167] and oxygen [177] are produced in high pu-
rity and can be used directly without further treatment. 

2.4.4. By-product oxygen 

On a mass basis, PEMEL yields a hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio of 1:8, 
which  means  that  only  11.11%  of  the  product  mass  attributes  to  the 
desired main product H2. As in the case of MP, the utilization of the by- 
product, thus, will be crucial for economic feasibility as well as envi-
ronmental performance of the process [19]. 

Present-day  applications  of  commercial  oxygen  comprise,  among 
others,  wastewater  treatment,  gas  cutting,  artificial  ventilation, 
bleaching of wood pulp, and the chemical synthesis of, e.g., ethylene and 
propylene  oxide,  vinyl  chloride,  and  caprolactam  [178,179].  One 
important  application  of  oxygen  are  combustion  processes,  where 
oxygen-enriched  air  is  used  to  overcome  mass-transfer  limitations  as 
well as increase flame velocity and temperature [180]. Commonly, air is 
the preferred oxidizing agent due to economic reasons. However, if large 
volumes of compressed air are required, oxygen enrichment displaces 
nitrogen  in  the  system,  thereby  avoiding  by-products,  reducing 
compression  effort,  and  enabling  higher  production  capacities  at 
reasonable equipment sizes [178,180]. The use of highly-pure oxygen by 
means of oxyfuel combustion processes, however, is no common prac-
tice in industry today due to economic reasons and material properties 
limitations [178]. A promising application of commercial oxygen on a 
large  scale  may  be  the  combination  of  oxyfuel  combustion  with  CCS 
technologies [181]. 

Conventionally, commercial oxygen is obtained through liquefaction 
and distillation of ambient air by means of cryogenic air separation, also 
known as the  Linde process [178]. Alternative concepts  comprise the 
production from air via adsorption or membrane separation [178]. At 
◦
C; the critical 
ambient pressures, the boiling point of oxygen is -182.96 
◦
point is -118.57 
C and 50.43 bar [182]. Oxygen may be transported as 
compressed  gas  (≥13.79  bar)  or  cryogenic  liquid  (<13.79  bar  and 
C) by rail, road, water, air, or pipeline [183–185]. For decen-
-146.50 
tralized  small-scale  applications,  oxygen  is  stored  in  compressed, 
gaseous form in steel cylinders, high-pressure tanks, or tube trailers at 
pressures  up  to  300  bar  [180,186].  For  industrial  large-scale 

◦

applications,  liquefaction  of  oxygen  enables  more  reasonable  storage 
sizes [178], as oxygen density increases by a factor of 860 compared to 
ambient  conditions  [179].  The  decrease  in  storage  sizes,  however,  is 
achieved at the expense of energy efficiency, as oxygen liquefaction is an 
energy-intensive  process.  Liquefied  oxygen  is  stored  in  powder-  and 
vacuum-insulated  cryogenic  storage  tanks  with  a  net  capacity  of 
approximately  2–80  m3  at  pressures  of  18-36  bar  and  vaporized  if 
needed  [179,187,188].  Combining  multiple  vaporizers,  discharge  ca-
pacities of 180–750 Nm3/h are reached [187]. Depending on the storage 
size,  boil-off  losses  account  for  0.12–0.42%  of  stored  oxygen  per  day 
[187,188]. At present, oxygen from PEMEL is primarily vented or stored 
until  it  is  needed.  In  the  future,  further  areas  of  applications  such  as 
oxyfuel  combustion  processes  may  arise  due  to  the  abundance  of 
highly-pure  oxygen  as  a  valuable  by-product  of  PEMEL,  thereby 
enabling its continuous industrial utilization. 

3. Life Cycle Assessment 

The environmental performance of hydrogen production technolo-
gies  was  assessed  following  the  methodology  of  life  cycle  assessment 
(LCA). In LCA, products and services are comprehensively and system-
atically  analyzed  regarding  their  associated  environmental  impacts. 
Thereby,  holistic LCA studies span the entire life cycle of the investi-
gated system, ranging from the acquisition of resources to production, 
transportation, storage, product use, recycling,  and treatment to final 
disposal [189]. Since this methodology is widely used, structured and 
internationally standardized through ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, the LCA 
approach is comprehensive, consistent and transparent [190,191]. Ac-
cording to ISO 14040, a LCA is divided into four phases: (1) goal and 
scope definition, (2) inventory analysis, (3) impact assessment, and (4) 
interpretation 
rational 
decision-making basis, ensures comparability of different products and 
processes through quantified impacts on the environment and serves to 
identify  improvement  potentials.  Hence,  LCA  is  a  feasible  tool  for 
environmental  assessment  of  production  routes  and  is  applicable  to 
compare alternative hydrogen production technologies. Regarding the 

[190].  This 

procedure 

provides 

a 

environmental  impact,  we  considered  the  most  important  16  impact 
categories  and  focused  on  the  category  climate  change  in  the  main 
section of this paper. For more details, please refer to the Supplemental 
Information section (SI). 

3.1. Goal and scope definition 

This  LCA  aims  at  quantifying  and  comparing  the  environmental 
impacts caused by the production of H2 by conventional and emerging 
technologies  while  focusing  on  transforming  energy  systems.  Four 
different  H2  production  processes  were  investigated  in  this study:  (1) 
steam  methane  reforming  (SMR),  (2)  SMR  with  carbon  capture  and 
storage (SMR-CCS), (3) methane pyrolysis (MP), and (4) polymer elec-
trolyte  membrane  electrolysis  (PEMEL)  with  altogether  nine  different 
process configurations elucidated below. 

The  scope  of  the  performed  LCA  is  from  “cradle-to-gate”,  which 
means from resource extraction to the factory gate (before a product is 
transported  to  the  consumer).  Subsequent  life  cycle  stages  such  as 
hydrogen  transport  and  storage  and  their  associated  environmental 
impacts do not depend on the applied hydrogen production technology. 
Hence, the consideration of these life cycle stages will not significantly 
change the overall conclusions of the study, making it non-relevant for 
the comparative assessment of hydrogen production technologies. Thus, 
in congruence with ISO 14044, all life cycle stages that are following the 
production  of  hydrogen  have  been  omitted  in  the  environmental 
assessment.  In  contrast,  all  life  cycle  phases  up  to  and  including  the 
production  of  hydrogen  were  considered  to  be  within  the  system 
boundaries (Fig. 8). 

The  function  of  the  product  systems  considered  is  quantified  by 
means of a so-called functional unit, which enables an objective com-
parison [190,191]. Here, the functional unit was chosen to be 1 kg H2 at 
30 bar pressure that becomes available at the production site. All the 
input  and  output  data  of  each  product  system  are  normalized  to  this 
reference (in a mathematical sense). 

Fig. 8. Overview of hydrogen production technologies considered in this study, comprising steam methane reforming (SMR), SMR with carbon capture and storage 
(SMR-CCS) with pre- (56%) and post-combustion (90%) capture technologies, methane pyrolysis (MP) with heat supplied from hydrogen (H2), carbon (C), natural 
gas (NG), or electricity (E), and polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis at state-of-the-art (PEMEL today) and future-state (PEMEL future). The dashed 
boxes indicate the technology choices investigated.

3.1.1. Multifunctionality 

Apart  from  H2,  other  valuable  by-products  are  produced  via  the 
investigated foreground processes, i.e., electricity generated from low- 
pressure steam  by SMR, carbon black by  MP, and oxygen by PEMEL. 
Several  well-established  approaches  exist  to  treat  by-products  within 
LCA, such as system expansion, allocation, and avoided burden [192, 
193]. This study includes by-products by means of the avoided burden 
method. This method assigns environmental credits for by-products to 
multifunctional  processes,  by  assuming  that  the  production  of  a 
by-product avoids its production by alternative processes. Considering 
avoided burdens allows one to compare alternative product systems and 
is  often  applied for assessing the  abatement potential in relation to a 
benchmark process. Here, environmental credits were assigned to SMR 
for electricity generated from excess steam by means of steam turbines. 
Likewise, carbon and oxygen production were given credit in MP and 
PEMEL. 

For the background system, data on multifunctional processes were 
obtained from the Ecoinvent v3.6 cut-off model and, thus, are already 
based on allocation [194]. Thereby, environmental impacts of a process 
were  allocated  to  commercially  viable  products  based  on  measurable 
criteria such as economic value, mass, and energy content. The supply 
chains and chemical processes are briefly described as follows. 

3.2. Inventory analysis 

All mass and energy flows within and crossing the boundaries of the 
investigated product system are quantified during the inventory analysis 
phase. The resulting dataset is referred to as Life Cycle Inventory (LCI). 
The LCI data for the considered hydrogen production processes are given 
in Table 2, 3, and 4, respectively. An overview of the database processes 
is given in the SI. Here, the foreground and the background system are 
distinguished from one another. 

3.2.1. Foreground system 

The following section describes the assumptions made regarding the 
LCI data for producing hydrogen by SMR, SMR-CCS, MP and PEMEL. LCI 
data  were  derived  from  the  cited  literature  and,  if  the  data  were 
incomplete, they were supplemented by process data from the Ecoinvent 
v3.6 database. By considering common operating hours, lifetimes and 
specific capacities of the technologies, the in- and output data of each 
production pathway was mathematically normalized to the functional 
unit of 1 kg H2. For industrial plants, operating hours of 8,000 h/a were 
assumed [20].

3.2.2. Steam methane reforming 

LCI data for SMR operation –  comprising  feedstock  pre-treatment, 
(pre-)reforming, high-temperature shift, and final purification by pres-
sure  swing  adsorption  (PSA)  –  were  taken  from  process  simulations 
published by the International Energy Agency (Fig. 9) [66]. 

Material  demands  for  SMR  plant  manufacturing  were  taken  from 
Spath et al [30]. and adapted based on the scale-up approach for process 
plants by Remer et al. [195]. The plant was considered to be operated as 
standalone, which means the possibility of heat integration within an 
industrial complex was neglected. Instead, produced excess steam was 
considered  to  be  converted  to  electricity  via  a  steam  turbine  and 
exported to the local grid. Consequently, this electricity was included as 
avoided burden that reduces the electricity which would be provided 
otherwise by the local technology mix. Electricity export increases the 
overall  process  efficiency  of  SMR  from  81.13%  to  83.40%  on  a  HHV 
basis [66]. A production capacity of 100,000 Nm3/h H2, annual oper-
ating hours of 8,000 h/a and a lifetime of 20 years were assumed. The 
LCI data used for SMR in this study are presented in Table 2. 

3.2.3. Steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage 

Few LCI data are available for the entire steam methane reforming 
with  carbon  capture  and  storage  (SMR-CCS)  process  sequence 
comprising  H2  production  by  SMR,  CO2  sequestration,  compression, 
transport,  and  storage.  Therefore,  data  were  combined  from  multiple 
studies  and  harmonized  to  the  same  plant  capacities  and  conditions. 
Data for SMR-CCS plant manufacturing and operation were taken from 
the same data sources as for SMR without CCS [30,66]. Like for con-
ventional  SMR,  a  production  capacity  of  100,000  Nm3/h  H2,  annual

Fig. 9. Block flow diagram of hydrogen production by conventional steam methane reforming (top), steam reforming with pre-combustion CO2  capture from the 
shifted syngas using aqueous methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) (middle), and post-combustion CO2 capture from the flue gas using aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) 
as absorbent (bottom), adapted from [66]. 

operating hours of 8,000 h/a and a lifetime of 20 years were assumed for 
the  SMR-CCS  plant.  Two  sequestration  technologies  were  considered, 
resulting in different capture efficiencies (Fig. 9). 

CO2  sequestration from the  shifted syngas  by chemical  absorption 
using  aqueous  methyldiethanolamine  (MDEA)  was  considered  as  the 
state-of-the-art  pre-combustion  technology,  reaching  capture  effi-
ciencies of approximately 56%. Alternatively, CO2  was assumed to be 
sequestered by post-combustion. Absorption from the flue gas was based 
on aqueous MEA as solvent, which is considered a promising technol-
ogy, enabling capture efficiencies of around 90% [66]. In both cases, the 
implementation of CCS technologies results in a higher natural gas de-
mand and less excess electricity that can be supplied to the local grid. 
Overall process efficiencies on HHV basis were calculated to 78.89% and 
74.47%  for  SMR-CCS  with  pre-  and  post-combustion  capture, 

respectively.  For  LCI  data  of  the  SMR-based  production  processes 
considered in this study, we refer the reader to Table 2. 

LCI data for the construction of a CO2 pipeline were approximated by 
a natural gas pipeline dataset from the Ecoinvent v3.6 database [194] 
and concur with related studies [67,68,72]. A capacity of 14,010 t CO2 
and a transport distance of 300 km were assumed, similar to Viebahn et 
al [72].. For compression during transport, an energy demand of 0.0171 
kWh/kg CO2 and fugitive CO2 emissions of 2.320 kg CO2 per kilometer 
and year were derived [68]. Storage of CO2  onshore in geological for-
mations requires suitable injection wells. Data for the construction and 
operation of injection wells were taken from Koornneef et al. and involve 
six wells at a depth of 3,000 m for a storage capacity of 7.3 Mt/a CO2 
annually.  For  the  storage  pressure  of  150  bar,  compressors  consume 
0.007 kWh/kg CO2 of electricity [68]. The injection wells are driven by

diesel fuel with 15.4 kg diesel/kg CO2 according to Verma et al [39].. 

3.2.4. Methane pyrolysis 

LCI data for MP refer to H2  production in a liquid bubble column 
reactor  using  tin  as  molten  media  and  were  taken  from  Postels  et  al. 
(Fig. 10) [139]. 

The  LCI  data  were  obtained  from  laboratory-scale  experiments, 
simulations,  and  literature  and  subsequently  scaled  to  a  prospective 
industrial  scale  process.  The data have  been  related to the  functional 
unit of 1 kg hydrogen and, therefore, do not include further information 
on plant capacities or lifetime. For the MP plant, a lifetime of 20 years 
with 8,000 hours of operation per year was assumed, analogous to the 
other technologies considered. 

Due to its significant heat demand, the environmental performance 
of MP strongly depends on the underlying heat supply. Renewable heat 
sources enable the production of climate friendly H2 by this technology. 
Promising  sources  for  renewable  heat  comprise  the  combustion  of 
fractions of the produced H2  (MP-H2), as well as conversion of renew-
able electricity into heat by means of inductive heating or power-to-heat 
technologies (MP-E). Alternatively, heat may be provided by combust-
ing natural gas (MP-NG) or the solid carbon by-product (MP-C), if the 
arising  CO2  is  subsequently  sequestered  and  stored  permanently  by 
means of a suitable CCS process. Heat supplied from external combus-
tion  was  calculated  based  on  the  lower  heating  values  of  hydrogen 
(120.00  MJ/kg),  carbon  (32.80  MJ/kg),  and  natural  gas  (36.60  MJ/ 
Nm3) [196], respectively. For natural gas combustion, a thermal boiler 
efficiency  of  85%  and  specific  emissions  of  56.10  kg  CO2/MJ  were 
assumed [197]. Associated CO2  emissions from heat supplied by com-
bustion  of  the  carbon  by-product  were  calculated  to  3.67  kg  CO2/kg 
carbon,  assuming  complete  combustion.  The  energetic  efficiency  of 
electricity-based  heating  was  estimated  to  95%.  On  HHV  basis,  this 
resulted in the following overall process efficiencies: MP-H2  (45.60%), 
MP-NG  (50.83%),  MP-C  (59.37%),  and  MP-E  (52.28%).  Additionally, 
the by-product carbon was included as an avoided burden for conven-
tional carbon black production Table 3. presents the LCI data of the four 
considered  MP-based  H2  production  processes  with  different  heat 
sources. 

3.2.5. Water electrolysis 

LCI data for water electrolysis refer to H2 production by PEMEL and 

were based on the study by Bareiß et al. (Fig. 11) [33]. 

For  present-day  production,  an  electrolyzer  capacity  of  1  MW  per 
stack with a specific electricity consumption of 55 kWh/kg H2 (ηHHV =
71.59%) was assumed. For industrial scale hydrogen production, mul-
tiple stacks are combined to form a large-scale electrolysis plant. In the 

future, the electrolyzer capacity was assumed to increase to 50 MW per 
stack, and the specific electricity consumption was assumed to decrease 
to  45  kWh/kg  H2  (ηHHV  = 87.50%).  Furthermore,  the  use  of  critical 
materials was assumed to decrease due to design improvements [33]. In 
both cases, annual operating hours of 8,000 h/a were considered. The 
lifetime of the stack was estimated at 10 years and the plant lifetime at 
20 years. Benefits due to economies of scale were accounted for in form 
of  material  savings  for  the  plant  following  the  scale-up  approach  of 
Remer et al. with a scaling factor of 0.7 [195]. In contrast, material in-
puts for stack construction are assumed to scale linearly with increasing 
electrolyzer capacity [198]. The LCI data of the PEMEL-based hydrogen 
production processes are presented in Table 4. 

The  by-product  oxygen  was  included  as  avoided  burden  for  con-
ventional  production  via  cryogenic  air  separation  [178].  Oxygen  is 
assumed  to  exit  the  electrolyzer  at  30  bar  and  25 
C.  To  ensure 
comparability to conventionally produced oxygen, the by-product oxy-
gen from PEMEL is assumed to be liquefied after leaving the electrolyzer. 
LCI data for oxygen liquefaction and storage were calculated based on a 
multi-stage compression process simulated in ASPEN Plus, following the 
concept of the Linde cycle as described in Johnson et al. [199]. Liquified 
◦
oxygen leaves the process at 18 bar and -178.9 
C. Electricity consumed 
for oxygen liquefaction was calculated to 0.8479 kWh/kg O2.

3.2.6. Background system 

The  background  system  includes  all  environmentally  relevant  ac-
tivities prior to the hydrogen production processes. For the background 
system,  LCI  databases  are  an  appropriate  data  source  [200].  In  this 
study,  the  LCI  database  Ecoinvent  v3.6  cut-off  was  used.  Ecoinvent 
provides two basic types of processes for modelling parts of the product 
system,  i.e.,  unit  processes  and  aggregated  processes.  A  unit  process 
comprises all in- and outputs of a single process of the product system 
("gate-to-gate"), whereas an aggregated process represents the LCI of one 
process  including  all  environmentally  relevant  flows  of  its  entire  up-
stream  system  (“cradle-to-gate”)  [194].  A  subcategory  of  aggregated 
processes  are  so-called  regional  market  datasets,  including  multiple 
production routes for a product in a specific region. The extent to which 
a certain production route is used thus depends on the considered re-
gion. By  using regional market datasets, it  is  possible to  consider the 
environmental  impacts  of  a  supply  chain  in  a  specific  region  without 
modelling each life cycle step individually. To consider the hydrogen life 
cycle  from  cradle-to-gate  and  to  not  underestimate  the  associated 
environmental impacts [201], the supply chains in this study were based 
on regional market datasets [194]. The datasets were chosen based on 
their respective regional allocation in a pre-defined order of prioritiza-
tion. If certain processes were unavailable for the preferred region, the

taken into account, i.e. combustion of part of (1) the natural gas (NG) feedstock, (2) the hydrogen (H2) product, (3) the solid carbon by-product (C), or (4) heat 
generation from electricity by inductive heating or power-to-heat technologies (E).

next  closest  region  was  selected.  For  domestic  H2  production  in  Ger-
many, the following prioritization of regions was chosen: Germany (DE), 
Europe  (RER),  Europe  without  Switzerland  (EWS),  global  (GLO),  and 
rest of the world (RoW). For country-specific results, datasets of natural 
gas and electricity supply have been adapted to the grid mixes in the 
respective country. A list of the background data applied in this study is 
provided in the SI. 

3.2.7. Electricity supply 

Electricity  was  either  assumed  to  be  supplied  by  country-specific 
electricity  grid  mixes  or  exclusively  from  RES.  Electricity  grid  mixes 
were characterized by the share of electricity generated by each tech-
nology. Technologies considered were photovoltaic and wind, as well as 
coal,  nuclear,  gas,  biogas,  and  hydropower  plants.  LCI  data  for  the 
electricity generation technologies were taken from the Ecoinvent v3.6 
cut-off  database  [194].  For  all  technologies,  resulting  environmental 
impacts  from  plant  manufacturing  and  infrastructure  development  as 
well as associated electricity losses from power transmission and voltage 
transformation  were  considered.  Current  electricity  grid  mixes  were 
represented  by  country-specific  technology-mixes  for  electricity  pro-
duction on high-voltage level based on statistics from the International 
Energy  Agency  and  the  European  Network  of  Transmission  System 
Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) [202,203]. As depicted in Table 5, 
future electricity grid mixes for Germany are based on studies from the 
Jülich  Research  Centre  (JRC)  [204]  and  the  Federal  Ministry  for

Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) [205] and include the predicted 
share of electricity production technologies in 2030 and 2050. Thereby, 
a decrease in the national GHG emissions by 80%, respectively 95% until 
2050 was taken as a basis. For onshore wind power, a turbine with a 
capacity of 4.5 MW, average full load hours of 2,000 h and a lifetime of 
20 years was assumed. For offshore wind power, the dataset included a 
turbine with a capacity of 2.0 MW, average full load hours of 4,000 h 
and  a  lifetime  of  20  years.  Photovoltaic  power  was  considered  by  a 
multi-Si panel with a total capacity of 570 kWp, average full load hours 
of 1,000 h and a lifetime of 30 years. Plant capacities and lifetimes of the 
power plants are based on the respective ecoinvent v3.6 dataset [194], 
whereas  assumed  average  full  load  hours  are  based  on  statistics  on 
electricity generation in Europe published by ENTSO-E [206]. 

3.2.8. Natural gas supply 

The  natural  gas  supply  was  included  in  form  of  regional  market 
datasets from the Ecoinvent v3.6 cut-off database [194], describing the 
extraction of natural gas in various countries and its subsequent supply 
by  means  of  high  pressure  pipeline  distribution  networks. 
Country-specific  data  were  characterized  by  the  share  of  domestic 
extraction  and  import  demands  from  various  places  of  origin,  which 
results in average transport distances [207,208]. All associated energy 
consumptions  and  upstream  emissions  from  gas  processing  and  leak-
ages,  i.e.  fugitive  emissions  are  included  [207,208].  No  significant 
technology improvements and, thus, no future decreases in the associ-
ated environmental impacts were assumed. 

3.3. Impact assessment 

The  life  cycle  impact  assessment  (LCIA)  step  uses  the  previously 
obtained LCI data to determine the environmental impact that is asso-
ciated with the considered product system. Hence, the individual envi-
ronmental  impacts  of  all  flows  crossing  the  system  boundaries  are 
assigned to multiple impact categories. The contribution of each flow in 
a  certain  category  is  quantified  by  means  of  characterization  factors. 
These factors are measurable quantities, which are set into relation to a 
reference  indicator.  Thereby,  both  the  characterization  factors  and 
reference  indicators  of  a  category  depend  on  the  impact  assessment 
model. The selected impact categories depend on the predefined goal 
and scope of the study as well as on the investigated product system, 
because  only  impact  categories  relevant  to  this  system  should  be 
considered. 

This study focused on the category climate change since the climate- 
friendly  production  of  hydrogen  and  its  implementation  in  energy- 
intensive sectors are primarily seen as a contribution towards reducing 
the GHG emissions. However, changes in supply and production chains 
motivated by the mitigation of climate change effects may lead to un-
expected environmental trade-offs and burden shifting to other impact 
categories [209,210]. Thus, a wider set of impact categories needs to be 
included in the assessment. 

To  ensure  an  internationally  recognized  and  consistent  approach, 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099614M. Hermesmann and T.E. Müller                                                                                                                                                                                                            

environmental  impacts  were  assessed  here  by  means  of  the  Environ-
mental Footprint (EF) 2.0 method. The underlying impact categories and 
characterization models are recommended by the International Refer-
ence Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) [211] and revised by the European 
Commission´s  Joint  Research  Centre  [212]  to  establish  a  best-practice 
approach.  The  models  of  the  Environmental  Footprint  2.0  method 
applied in this study are depicted in SI. Depending on the reliability of 
the  model  and  its  associated  characterization  factors,  the  models  are 
ranked  into  three  levels  of  recommendation  [212].  The  16  recom-
mended  impact  categories  are  referred  to  as:  climate  change,  ozone 
depletion, human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer effects), particulate 
matter,  ionizing  radiation,  photochemical  ozone  formation,  acidifica-
tion, eutrophication (terrestrial, freshwater, marine), ecotoxicity, land 
use, water scarcity, and resource use (minerals and metals and energy 
carriers). 

4. Environmental Impacts 

In the following, the environmental impact in the category climate 
change  associated  with  each  hydrogen  production  technology  is 
assessed first based on the currently prevailing conditions in Germany as 
reference case. Here, the main contributors to the GWI are identified. By 
considering a best-case scenario in which electricity is supplied exclu-
sively by offshore wind power plants, the improvement potential upon 
implementation  of  the  energy  system  transformation  is  estimated  for 
each  technology.  This  allows  identifying  which  hydrogen  production 
technology will be the environmentally most favorable one regarding 
climate  change  in  the  long  run.  To  identify  possible  burden  shifting 
between different environmental impact categories, the impact of the 
technology was briefly assessed for the remaining 15 impact categories 
of the EF 2.0 method. 

By varying the underlying supply chains for electricity and including 
future scenarios for the German electricity grid mix, we subsequently 
investigated how the performance of a certain technology is affected by 
the  energy  system  transformation.  Likewise,  we  assessed  when  and 
under which circumstances a specific hydrogen production technology 
will become the environmentally most favorable alternative. This allows 
identifying suitable bridging technologies for environmentally favorable 
hydrogen production as well as anticipating how long it will take until 
the long-term solution becomes environmentally superior. 

Finally, by taking account of regional differences in the underlying 
electricity and natural gas supply chains, specific datasets for selected 
countries were obtained (Table 6). It is estimated, how much the CO2 
footprint of a specific national electricity grid mix must be reduced until 
the long-term solution is reached. 

4.1. Case study 

Fig. 12 illustrates the Global Warming Impact (GWI) caused by the 
present-day production of 1 kg hydrogen in Germany with regard to the 
technologies considered in this study. The contributions to the total GWI 
are summarized in Table 7. 

4.1.1. Reference case 

With electricity supplied from the current grid mix in Germany and 
without  considering  the  utilization  of  by-products,  the  resulting  GWI 
ranges  from  3.94  to  34.85  kg  CO2-eq/kg  H2.  Conventional  “grey”

hydrogen production by SMR causes 11.57 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. Here, the 
main contributors are process-related GHG emissions with a GWI of 9.00 
kg CO2-eq/kg H2  (77.75%) and the supply of natural gas with 2.56 kg 
CO2-eq/kg H2 (22.13%). 

The combination of SMR with CCS technologies for producing “blue” 
hydrogen  leads  to  a  considerable  decrease  in  process-related  GHG 
emissions  and,  thus, the  total  GWI. State-of-the-art  CO2  sequestration 
from shifted syngas with a capture efficiency of 56% results to a total 
GWI of 6.87 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, of which 4.12 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, respec-
tively  60,0%  are  caused  by  process-related  emissions.  Higher  capture 
efficiencies of 90% obtained by post-combustion capture of CO2  from 
the flue gas further decreases the total GWI to 3.97 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 and 
the contribution of process-related emissions to 24.9%. The increasing 
demand in electricity and natural gas due to the additional CCS process 
steps showed only a marginal effect with respect to the GWI. 

Producing “turquoise” hydrogen by MP-based processes results in a 
GWI of 9.91, 7.65, 6.45, and 3.94 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, when heat is pro-
vided  by  electricity,  carbon,  natural  gas,  and  hydrogen,  respectively. 
Thus, the source of heat generation considerably affects the total GWI of 
MP-based hydrogen production technologies. As for SMR, a high share 
of the overall GWI of MP is associated with the supply of natural gas. The 
GWI caused by the underlying natural gas supply chain ranges from 3.01 
kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for the systems heated by electricity (30.4%), carbon 
combustion (39.4%) to 3.53 and 3.93 kg CO2-eq/kg H2  for the natural 
gas (54.8%) and hydrogen (71.7%) heated system, respectively. Thus, 
the natural gas supply of the hydrogen-heated system causes a higher 
GWI than the system heated by natural gas which is related to conver-
sion losses linked with the production of additional hydrogen for heating 
purposes.  No  process-related  GHG  emissions  are  associated  with  the 
production of hydrogen by MP, if the process is heated by electricity or 
the combustion of hydrogen. Process-related GHG emissions account for 
1.73 and 3.44 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for the natural gas (26.8%) and carbon 
(45.0%) heated systems. For a truly CO2-free hydrogen production by 
MP, the GHG emissions associated with heat supply, thus, would need to 
be sequestered and stored for the long term. 

The contribution of electricity supply to the total GWI of MP differs 
significantly between the alternatives considered for heat supply. In the 
case of heat from electricity, the supply of electricity from the current 
grid mix accounts for 6.52 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (65.78%) of the total GWI. 
For alternative heat sources, the contribution of the electricity supply to 
the total GWI ranges from 0.81 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for the natural gas- and 
carbon-heated system to 1.06 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for the hydrogen-heated 
system.  The  supply  of  tin  for  charging  the  reactor  with  liquid  metal 
causes 0.35 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for the hydrogen-heated and 0.27 kg CO2- 
eq/kg H2 for the other MP-based systems. The higher GWI of the supply 
chains of the hydrogen-heated system is caused by the necessary pro-
duction of additional hydrogen for heating purposes. 

The production of “green” hydrogen by state-of-the-art PEMEL with 
electricity from the present-day grid mix results in the highest GWI of 
34.85 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. With 34.83 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (99.92%), most of 
the total GWI is caused by the supply of electricity. This concurs with the 
results  of  previous  studies  [15,36].  The  remaining  impacts  on  global 
warming  are  traced  back  to  plant  manufacturing  (0.07%)  and  water 
supply (0.02%). No process-related emissions arise during the produc-
tion of hydrogen by PEMEL. Further improvements in PEMEL technol-
ogy  may  decrease  the  total  GWI  to  28.50  kg  CO2-eq/kg  H2  which, 
however,  is  still  not  competitive  to  the  other  hydrogen  production 
technologies considered. 

The contribution of plant manufacturing to the total GWI is marginal 
for  all  technologies  considered,  which  is  a  common  observation  in 
process-based LCA studies [31,213]. Likewise, the supply of process and 
cooling water does not represent a considerable proportion of the total 
GWI.

reference case that is associated with each hydrogen production tech-
nology  considered  is  presented  in  Table  8.  Supplying  electricity  from 
offshore wind power plants instead of the present-day grid mix does not 
result in a change in the GWI of “grey” hydrogen production by SMR due 
to its self-sufficiency in electricity. For all other hydrogen production 
technologies  considered,  the  GWI  decreases.  For  producing  “blue” 
hydrogen by SMR-CCS, additional electricity is necessary for the sub-
sequent  CCS  process  steps.  Thus,  the  change  in  electricity  supply  de-
creases the total GWI by 0.08–0.13 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 in the case of pre- 
combustion and post-combustion capture, respectively. This results in a 
total  GWI  of  6.79  and  3.83  kg  CO2-eq/kg  H2  for  producing  “blue” 
hydrogen in the best-case scenario, which corresponds to a reduction of 
1.13, 3.35% relative to the reference case, respectively. 

The  production  of  “turquoise”  hydrogen  by  MP-based  processes 

shows improvement potentials of 0.79– 6.36 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 compared 
with the reference case. The lowest decrease with respect to the GWI is 
assigned to the carbon and natural gas-heated systems. The total GWI in 
the best-case scenario accounts for 6.85 for the carbon heated and 5.65 
kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for the natural gas heated system, which corresponds 
to an improvement by 10.38 and 12.30%, respectively. The hydrogen- 
heated system has a higher demand for electricity, due its higher pro-
duction capacity required for producing additional hydrogen for heating 
purposes. Thus, it shows a higher improvement potential upon reducing 
the  GWI  of  the  underlying  electricity  supply  chain.  Compared  to  the 
reference case, the total GWI of the hydrogen-heated system decreases 
by 1.03 kg CO2-eq/kg H2  (18.87%), which results in a remaining total 
GWI  of  4.44  kg  CO2-eq/kg  H2.  Among  the  MP-based  processes,  the 
electricity-heated  system  is  characterized  by  the  highest  electricity

demand. Consequently, its GWI is reduced the most, when electricity is 
supplied by offshore wind power plants instead of being taken from the 
present-day grid mix. In comparison to the reference case, the total GWI 
of  the  electricity-heated  system  is  reduced  by  6.36  kg  CO2-eq/kg  H2 
(64.17%), which results in a total GWI of 3.55 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 in the 
best-case scenario. 

The  production  of  “green”  hydrogen  by  state-of-the-art  PEMEL 
shows the highest improvement potential among all hydrogen produc-
tion  technologies  considered.  If  electricity  is  supplied  exclusively  by 
offshore  wind  power  plants,  the  total  GWI  of  “green”  hydrogen  de-
creases by 34.0 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (97.8%), which results in a total GWI of 
0.88  kg  CO2-eq/kg  H2.  Hydrogen  production  by  future  state  PEMEL 
shows  an  improvement  potential  of  27.8  kg  CO2-eq/kg  H2  (97.5%), 
which  results in  the lowest total GWI of 0.70 kg CO2-eq/kg H2  of all 
technologies  considered.  Note  that  in  case  of  directly  supplying  the 
PEMEL with 100% renewable electricity, significant energy storage ca-
pacities are needed to deal with the intermittency of RES. Moreover, a 
direct supply of electricity from renewable power plants often requires 
an  oversizing  of  the  electrolyzer,  which  may  induce  higher  costs  and 
environmental impacts. 

The herein reported impacts in the category climate change for both 
the reference case (electricity from present-day grid mix) and the best- 
case scenario (electricity from wind) are in high congruence with the 
results reported in previous studies, e.g., [30,31,36,139,214]. 

4.1.3. Other environmental impacts 

Substituting conventional SMR  by future-state PEMEL leads to co- 
benefits  in  other  environmental  impacts.  In  total,  7  of  16  environ-
mental impacts are reduced by 52–98%. The highest relative reductions 
are realized for ozone depletion (98%), depletion of energy resources 
(96%), and climate change (94%). Co-benefits in other environmental 
impacts resulting from decarbonization have already been observed and 
recently discussed in other studies [210,215], but with a focus on energy 
systems instead of hydrogen production technologies. However, apart 
from environmental co-benefits, hydrogen production by PEMEL instead 
of SMR also results in environmental burden shifting in 9 of 16 cate-
gories, and, thus, significant increases in other environmental impacts. 
For  instance,  impacts  increase  with  respect  to  mineral  and  metal 
depletion  (3792%),  freshwater  ecotoxicity  (431%),  water  scarcity 
(225%), and land use (140%). As in the case of climate change, elec-
tricity supply is the main contributor to all environmental impacts of 
PEMEL, being responsible for at least 90% of the impacts in each cate-
gory. Studies focusing on the energy transition often reported increases 
in  the  same  environmental  impacts,  especially  metal  depletion  [210, 
216,217].  Environmental  burden  shifting  due  to  “green”  hydrogen 
production  is  mainly  caused  by  the  expansion  of  renewable  power 
plants, which is necessary to meet the significant electricity demand of 
PEMEL. Remaining hurdles such as freshwater consumption in regions 

suffering water scarcity as well as the high demand of scarce materials 
for electrolyzers and renewable power plants needs to be overcome to 
fully justify the implementation of a green hydrogen infrastructure. Note 
that 6 of 9 categories with increasing impact are characterized by a high 
level of uncertainty (II/III–III, cf. SI). Thus, an improvement in LCA and 
LCIA methods is necessary to satisfactorily assess and fully understand 
the  consequences  that  result  from  the  ongoing  energy  system  trans-
formation as well as the transition towards green hydrogen production. 
If “blue” and “turquoise” hydrogen production by SMR-CCS and MP 
is accordingly implemented, environmental impacts increase in all cat-
egories except climate change. As for PEMEL, impacts increase the most 
regarding metal depletion. For SMR-CCS, infrastructure development, as 
well as higher energy and material demand for applying CCS technology 
results in reasonable increases of environmental impacts by 3–36%. By 
contrast, hydrogen production by MP leads to much higher increases in 
all categories except climate change. In accordance with Postels et. al 
[139],  increases  in  impacts  mainly  stem  from  the  higher  demand  of 
natural gas compared to SMR, as well as the considerably higher demand 
of metals for plant manufacturing and charging the reactor with liquid 
tin.  Noteworthy  is  that  MP-based  hydrogen  production  is  still  being 
developed and considerable improvements are feasible. For further in-
formation, please see the SI. 

4.1.4. Utilization of by-products 

Following the avoided burden method, the use of by-products would 
lead to a considerable decrease in the GWI of all hydrogen production 
technologies considered. However, with a proceeding energy transition, 
the GWI caused by the conventional production of the by-products will 
also  be  reduced.  Consequently,  the  avoided  burden  caused  by 
substituting  the  conventional  production  of  these  products  will  be 
reduced equally and the utilization of by-products becomes less crucial. 
For “grey” hydrogen production by SMR, exporting the excess elec-
tricity from hydrogen production to the current grid would decrease the 
total  GWI by  0.70 kg CO2-eq/kg  H2,  which  corresponds to  6.04%. If, 
however, the excess electricity is used for substituting electricity from 
offshore wind power plants, as assumed in the best-case scenario, the 
avoided burden decreases to 0.02 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. 

For “blue” hydrogen production by SMR-CCS, the avoided burden of 
excess electricity decreases compared with the conventional SMR pro-
cess,  because  additional  electricity  is  needed  for  the  sequestration, 
transport, and storage of CO2. The avoided burden for the overall pro-
cess sequence of SMR-CCS with a capture efficiency of 56% amounts to 
0.03 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 in the reference case and is marginal for the best- 
case scenario. For post-combustion capture with efficiencies of 90%, no 
excess electricity remains that can be exported to the local grid. Instead, 
the excess electricity generated during hydrogen production by SMR is 
used entirely for the subsequent CCS system. 

The  overall  GWI  of  MP-based  “turquoise”  hydrogen  production 
would significantly decrease if the conventional production of carbon 
black is avoided by utilizing the carbon by-product. Here, the avoided 
burden is the same for both the reference and the best-case scenario, as 
conventional  carbon  black  production  does  not  consume  significant 
amounts of electricity and, thus, is assumed not to improve regarding its 
GWI, when electricity is supplied from offshore wind power plants. The 
highest avoided burden with respect to the GWI is obtained in case of the 
hydrogen heated system. Here, the total GWI is decreased by 7.33 kg 
CO2-eq/kg H2, respectively 133.9%, leading to a net-negative GWI for 
hydrogen  production.  For  the  other  MP-based  processes,  the  avoided 
burden accounts for 3.86 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for carbon (50.5%) and 5.62 
kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for electricity (56.8%) and natural gas (87.2%) heated 
systems. 

Avoiding the production of oxygen by cryogenic air separation under 
present-day conditions and, instead, using oxygen from PEMEL, would 
lead to an avoided burden of 2.89 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. This would decrease 
the overall GWI of “green” hydrogen production by PEMEL by 8.29% for 
the  state-of-the-art  and  10.10%  for  the  future-state  technology.  The 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099617M. Hermesmann and T.E. Müller                                                                                                                                                                                                            

production  of oxygen by  cryogenic air separation consumes consider-
able amounts of electricity. Thus, the GWI of this technology will also 
decrease  with  the  GWI  of  the  supplied  electricity.  Consequently,  the 
environmental credit given for substituting oxygen from cryogenic air 
separation by oxygen from PEMEL is considerably lower in the best-case 
scenario. Here, the avoided burden amounts to 0.07 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. 
In the following, environmental credits were assigned to SMR-based 
processes for excess electricity since electricity is an easily usable by- 
product  and  energy  recovery  from  excess  steam  is  already  common 
practice in industry today. By contrast, carbon and oxygen production 
was no longer given any credit in MP and PEMEL due to the questionable 
quality, respectively market size of the by-product. 

4.2. Supply chain analysis 

In the following sections, the influence of electricity and natural gas 
supply chains are analyzed, because these have been identified as the 
main contributors to the environmental impacts of hydrogen production 
processes.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  on  these  most  critical 
parameters, considering country-specific grid mixes and supply chains. 

4.2.1. Electricity supply variation 

Fig. 13 depicts the impacts in the category climate change associated 
with  the  production  of  1  kg  hydrogen  by  SMR,  SMR-CCS,  MP,  and 
PEMEL  (ordinate)  as  a  function  of  the  GWI  of  electricity  supply  (ab-
scissa). The GWI of each hydrogen production technology is indicated by 
a  curve  colored  according  to  the  hydrogen-production  color  code 
(Table 1). The gradient of a curve represents the sensitivity of the GWI of 
the respective technology to the GWI of electricity supply and, thus, the 
change  in  their  impact  in  the  category  climate  change  due  to  a 

proceeding energy transition. The GWI of hydrogen production by each 
technology which is not caused by electricity supply is represented by 
the ordinate intercept of each curve. 

4.2.2. Sensitivity to electricity supply 

The  considered  hydrogen  production  technologies  strongly  differ 
with respect to their sensitivity to the GWI of electricity supply. In the 
case of hydrogen production by SMR and SMR-CCS with a capture ef-
ficiency of 56%, excess electricity is generated by steam turbines and 
exported to the local grid. If the GWI of the local electricity grid mix 
decreases,  the  environmental  credit  given  for  producing  electricity  is 
reduced as well. Thus, the GWI of these technologies increases with a 
decreasing GWI of electricity supply. By contrast, the GWI of hydrogen 
production  by  SMR-CCS  (90%)  is  reduced  with  a  proceeding  energy 
transition,  because  the  overall  process  sequence  demands  additional 
electricity supply. 

Likewise,  the  GWI  of  hydrogen  production  by  MP  and  PEMEL  is 
continuously reduced if the GWI of electricity supply is reduced. For MP, 
the sensitivity to the underlying electricity supply depends on the form 
of heat generation. Here, the highest sensitivity to electricity supply is 
associated with the electricity-heated system, followed by the hydrogen- 
heated, and, finally, the natural gas- and carbon-heated system. Among 
all considered technologies, the GWI of “green” hydrogen production by 
state-of-the-art PEMEL is characterized by the highest sensitivity to the 
GWI  of  electricity  supply,  even  if  a  further  development  of  the  tech-
nology will decrease this sensitivity due to a lower specific electricity 
consumption of the electrolyzer. 

4.2.3. Anticipated technology shifts 

Due to their different sensitivities to the GWI of electricity supply,

lines represent the estimated GWI of electricity supply from renewable power plants and grid mixes of today and for future scenarios (cf Table 5.). 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099618M. Hermesmann and T.E. Müller                                                                                                                                                                                                            

the  environmentally  least  harmful  hydrogen  production  technology 
with respect to the GWI changes with a proceeding energy transition. If a 
high share of electricity is generated from fossil fuels as under present- 
day  conditions,  “green”  hydrogen  production  by  PEMEL  causes  the 
highest GWI of the considered technologies, whereas SMR-CCS and MP 
may decrease the GWI caused by conventional hydrogen production by 
SMR (see reference case). With a rising share of RES in the electricity 
grid mix, the GWI of hydrogen production by PEMEL is decreased most 
significantly and has the potential to emerge as the least harmful tech-
nology with respect to climate change (see best-case scenario). The GWI 
of electricity supply at which PEMEL becomes environmentally favor-
able with respect to a certain technology is indicated by the intersection 
point  between  their  respective  curves  in  Fig.  13.  The  intersections  of 
future-state PEMEL with all other hydrogen production technologies are 
given in Table 9. 

By considering the estimated GWI of electricity supply from renew-
able power plants and the grid mix in Germany of today and for future 
scenarios,  the  time  for  recommended  technology  shifts  in  hydrogen 
production  can  be  anticipated.  Accordingly,  hydrogen  production  by 
PEMEL  becomes  environmentally  competitive  to  conventional  SMR  if 
the GWI of electricity supply decreases to 250.78 g CO2-eq/kWh, which 
corresponds to a reduction by 60.40% compared to present-day condi-
tions. Considering the GWI of future electricity grid mixes in Germany 
ranging from 49.06 to 478.24 g CO2-eq/kWh (cf Table 5.), Germany is 
anticipated to reach this milestone between 2030 and 2050. 

For surpassing the production of hydrogen by SMR-CCS and MP, the 
GWI  of  electricity  provided  for  PEMEL  must  be  reduced  further.  To 
become the environmentally least harmful technology with respect to 
climate  change,  the  GWI  of  electricity  provided  for  PEMEL  must 
decrease  to  at  least  85.25  g  CO2-eq/kWh,  which  corresponds  to  a 
reduction  by  86.54%  compared  to  current  conditions.  Consequently, 
electricity must be supplied almost exclusively from wind or photovol-
taic power plants, which is, considering current national policies, not 
anticipated to take place before 2050. 

For a higher GWI of electricity supply, “blue” hydrogen production 
by  SMR-CCS  with  a  capture efficiency  of 90%  is  the  environmentally 
most favorable technology with respect to climate change. Likewise, in 
the  case  of  Germany,  all  other  technologies  for  producing  “blue”  or 
“turquoise”  hydrogen  by  SMR-CCS  or  MP  are  anticipated  to  be  envi-
ronmentally  favorable  to  SMR  and  PEMEL  with  respect  to  climate 
change  for  the  upcoming  decades.  Thus,  these  technologies  may 
immediately decrease the GWI of hydrogen production under present- 
day  conditions  and  trigger  the  development  of  a  suitable  hydrogen 
infrastructure until hydrogen production by PEMEL becomes environ-
mentally favorable. 

4.2.4. Country-specific impact of hydrogen production 

Fig.  14  and  Fig.  15  illustrate  the  impacts  in  the  category  climate 
change associated with the production of 1 kg hydrogen by SMR and

of  electricity  supply  (abscissa)  and  natural  gas  supply  (ordinate).

the set of 15 European countries are depicted in Fig. 16. 

4.2.5. Present-day setting 

The GWI of hydrogen production by SMR, SMR-CCS, MP, and PEMEL 
varies  considerably,  because  the  environmental  performance  of  these 
technologies is highly sensitive to the underlying electricity and natural 
gas supply. Conventional “grey” hydrogen production by SMR results in 
a GWI ranging from 9.01 to 13.55 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. The variations in the 
GWI associated with SMR can primarily be ascribed to differences in the 
underlying natural gas supply, since the export of excess electricity to 
the  grid  and,  thus,  the  GWI  of  electricity  supply  contributes  only 
marginally  to  the  total  GWI  of  SMR.  For  instance,  Norway,  Ireland, 
Denmark,  the  Netherlands,  and  the  United  Kingdom  hold  extensive 
amounts  of  natural  gas  reserves  and  primarily  meet  their  natural  gas 
demand by domestic production. In contrast, countries such as Germany 
and France highly depend on imports of natural gas. The long-distance 
transport and distribution of natural gas is suffering from gas leakages 
and energy consumption for regular gas compression, which ultimately 
leads to a higher GWI of natural gas supply for countries relying mainly 
on natural gas imports [194]. 

Hydrogen production by SMR-CCS results in a GWI of 4.70–9.35 kg 
CO2-eq/kg H2 and 1.71–6.65 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for capture efficiencies of 
56% and 90%, respectively. The production of hydrogen by MP results 
in  a  GWI  of  1.40–11.56  kg  CO2-eq/kg  H2.  As  in  the  case  of  “grey” 
hydrogen,  the  GWI  associated  with  producing  “blue”  and  “turquoise” 
hydrogen mainly depends on the GWI of natural gas supply. Compared 
to  the  other  technologies  for  “grey”,  “blue”,  or  “turquoise”  hydrogen 
production, the GWI of MP-E is more sensitive to the GWI of electricity 
supply, due to its higher electricity demand for heating purposes. 

The  GWI  of  “green”  hydrogen  production  by  PEMEL  varies  most 
widely from 0.99 to 36.94 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, and from 0.80 to 32.42 kg 
CO2-eq/kg H2 for state-of-the-art and future-state PEMEL, respectively. 
As PEMEL does not consume any natural gas, the wide variation in the 
GWI of hydrogen production can entirely be traced back to the differ-
ences in electricity supply (cf Fig. 13.). 

Under  current  conditions  in  the  respective  15  countries,  conven-
tional hydrogen production by SMR causes either the highest (in 4 of the 
15 countries) or second highest (11/15) impact in the category climate 
change of all considered technologies. Furthermore, as it is a mature and 
already well-developed technology which only marginally benefits from 
the energy transition because of its low electricity demand, it is expected 
to  show  the  lowest  improvement  potential  among  the  technologies 
considered. 

Through the reduction in process-related GHG emissions, the intro-
duction  of  any  of  the  “blue”  and  “turquoise”  hydrogen  production 
technologies  has  the  potential  to  immediately  decrease  the  GWI  of 
hydrogen  production  in  all  countries  considered.  Under  present-day 
conditions, SMR-CCS with a capture efficiency of 90% is the environ-
mentally most favorable technology with respect to climate change in 13 
of the 15 countries considered. Depending on the country considered, 
the  substitution  of  conventional  SMR  by  SMR-CCS  (90%)  would 
decrease the GWI of current hydrogen production by 50.9–81.4%. The 
highest  mitigation  potentials  could  be  reached  in  Norway  (81.4%), 
Ireland (81.0%), Denmark (79.5%), and the United Kingdom (78.8%). 
As previously mentioned, these countries are characterized by domestic 
natural gas reserves and, consequently, a low GWI of natural gas supply. 
Hence,  the  burden  of  higher  natural  gas  demand  caused  by  the  CCS 
technology (cf Table 2.) is more than offset by the associated benefit of 
GHG mitigation. The lower the GWI of natural gas supply is, the higher 
the benefit of implementing CCS technologies. 

Among all considered technologies, “green” hydrogen production by 
PEMEL shows the greatest variation in GWI, mostly resulting in either 
the lowest or the highest impact in the category climate change. In fact,

the-art  PEMEL  is  the  least  favorable  technology  concerning  climate 
change in 12 of 15, whereas it shows the lowest GWI in 2 of 15 countries 
considered. The impact in the category climate change of present-day 
hydrogen production by PEMEL is mainly caused by the respective na-
tional electricity supply. Specifically, the GWI of the electricity grid mix 
in Germany and the Netherlands is high, since most of their electricity is 
generated from fossil resources via, e.g., natural gas and coal-fired power 
stations.  Substituting  conventional  SMR  by  state-of-the-art  PEMEL 
supplied  from  grid  electricity  would  increase  the  GWI  of  present-day 
hydrogen production in Germany and the Netherlands by 220.6% and 

254.1%,  respectively.  However,  for  Norway,  Sweden,  France,  and 
Switzerland,  conventional  hydrogen  production  by  SMR  is  the  envi-
ronmentally least favorable technology with respect to climate change. 
For  these  countries,  the  GWI  of  hydrogen  production  by  PEMEL  is 
considerably lower, because their electricity already originates mostly 
from either nuclear or renewable power plants, resulting in a low GWI of 
electricity  supply.  Here,  a  technology  shift  to  state-of-the-art  PEMEL 
would lead to an immediate decrease in the GWI of hydrogen produc-
tion. The potential decrease in GWI amounts to 50.0%, 57.2%, 73.7%, 
and 89.8% for Switzerland, France, Sweden, and Norway, respectively.

Fig. 16. Global Warming Impact (GWI) caused by the production of 1 kg hydrogen by (1) PEMEL future, (2) SMR, (3) SMR-CCS (56%), (4) SMR-CCS (90%), (5) MP- 
H2, (6) M-C, (7) MP-NG, and (8) MP-E for 15 selected European countries in dependence of their electricity and natural gas supply chains. 

Among the countries considered, Norway and Sweden show the lowest 
GWI of electricity supply. Here, hydrogen production by PEMEL is the 
environmentally  most  favorable  technology  with  respect  to  climate 
change under current conditions. 

Through a proceeding energy transition, a rising share of renewably 
generated  electricity  in  the  national  grid  mixes  will  lead  to  a  signifi-
cantly decreasing GWI of the electricity supply. The GWI of the natural 
gas supply, however, will be only slightly affected by a proceeding en-
ergy  transition,  because  the  electricity  consumed  for  operating  the 
technical equipment such as compressors only contributes marginally to 

the  overall  GWI  of  natural  gas  supply.  Furthermore,  since  exploiting 
natural gas as an exhaustible natural resource may be more difficult in 
the future, this may ultimately lead to an increasing GWI of natural gas 
supply.  As  hydrogen  production  by  PEMEL  is  characterized  by  the 
highest  sensitivity  to  the  underlying  electricity  supply,  “green” 
hydrogen may have the potential to outperform conventional hydrogen 
production by SMR and even to become the most favorable technology 
with respect to GWI in the future.

4.2.7. PEMEL future vs. SMR-CCS (90%) 

Fig. 14  shows the impacts  in the  category climate  change of  elec-
tricity  and  natural gas  supply  for which  future-state  PEMEL  will sup-
posedly become favorable to conventional hydrogen production by SMR 
regarding the GWI. Assuming a constant GWI of natural gas supply in the 
future, the GWI of electricity supply for these recommended technology 
shifts has been anticipated (cf Table 10.). 

The  GWI  of  electricity  supply  for  which  future-state  PEMEL  is 
anticipated to become environmentally favorable to SMR with respect to 
climate change ranges from 207.30 to 304.95 g CO2-eq/kWh. Supplying 
electricity entirely from RES in, e.g., Germany, would result in a GWI of 
31.52, 15.43, and 82.50 g CO2-eq/kWh, for onshore and offshore wind 
power plants and photovoltaics, which is well below the required GWI. 
Consequently,  hydrogen  production  by  PEMEL  has  the  potential  to 
become favorable to conventional SMR with respect to climate change in 
all countries considered. 

Present-day  technology  mixes  for  electricity  generation  and,  thus, 
the  required  reductions  in  GWI  of  electricity  supply  to  justify  the 
introduction of PEMEL strongly vary between the countries considered. 
In countries such as Norway, Sweden, France, Switzerland, and Finland, 
no further reductions in the GWI of electricity supply are required and 
future-state  PEMEL  would  already  be  the  most  climate-friendly 
hydrogen  production  technology  under  current  conditions.  For  the 
remaining  countries,  the  required  reduction  in  the  GWI  of  electricity 
supply varies widely between 0.67% and 63.91%, so it is likely that the 
time at which PEMEL outperforms conventional SMR will significantly 
differ for each country. For countries which require a high reduction in 
the  GWI  of  electricity  supply,  such  as  the  Netherlands  (63.91%)  and 
Germany (60.40%), either an import of more climate-friendly hydrogen 
or the introduction of bridging technologies may be suitable until the 
national energy transition advances further. 

Whether  the  introduction  of  a  bridging  technology  is  suitable  de-
pends on its lifetime. From an economic perspective, the assets of a new 
hydrogen production plant and its associated infrastructure should be 
fully depreciated before it is decommissioned. A full depreciation of a 
new production plant, however, may take multiple decades. Here, we 
consider  the  required  reduction  in  the  GWI  of  electricity  supply  for 
which  a technology shift becomes suitable as an estimate of the time 
span a bridging technology may be preferable. The time at which the 
required  GWI  of  electricity  will  be  reached  greatly  depends  on  the 
country considered. An approximation may be possible by considering 
the national strategies on climate change mitigation. 

Under current conditions, either PEMEL or SMR-CCS (90%) are the 
environmentally most favorable hydrogen production technologies with 
respect  to  climate  change  in  the  countries  considered  (cf  Table  12). 
Thus, after outperforming SMR-CCS (90%), PEMEL would become the 
environmentally  most  favorable  technology  with  respect  to  climate 
change  in  all  countries  considered. For  more  information  about  tech-
nology  shifts  between  PEMEL  and  the  other  hydrogen  production 
technologies, please refer to the SI. 

The  impacts  in  the  category  climate  change  of  the  electricity  and 
natural  gas  supply  for  which  future-state  PEMEL  is  anticipated  to 
outperform  SMR-CCS  (90%)  and,  thus,  become  the  most  favorable 
hydrogen production technology with respect to the GWI are depicted in 
Fig. 15. The GWI of electricity supply for these recommended technol-
ogy shifts has been anticipated (cf Table 11.). 

The GWI of electricity supply for which future-state PEMEL would 
become environmentally favorable to SMR-CCS (90%) with respect to 
climate change ranges from 36.14 to 146.46 g CO2-eq/kWh and, thus, 
would be much lower than the technology shift from conventional SMR 
to PEMEL. Even so, the electricity supply from renewable power plants 
results in lower impacts in the category climate change than required for 
justifying the technology shift from SMR-CCS (90%) to PEMEL. Conse-
quently, PEMEL may emerge as the least harmful hydrogen production 
technology with respect to climate change in all countries considered. 
However, a GWI of electricity supply in this order of magnitude requires 
generation of electricity almost entirely from RES. For many countries 
this is not expected to occur before 2050. Thus, for the next decades, 
SMR-CCS (90%) will likely remain the environmentally most favorable 
hydrogen  production  technology  regarding  climate  change  in  many 
countries. 

Considering the required reductions in the GWI of electricity supply 
to establish PEMEL as the environmentally most favorable technology in 
a  specific  country,  it  can  be  anticipated,  if  the  implementation  of 
bridging technologies such as SMR-CCS (90%) would be a suitable near- 
and medium-term solution. 

From an environmental perspective, countries which require a low or 
even  no  further  reduction  in  the  GWI  of  electricity  supply  (Norway, 
Sweden) could focus on “green” hydrogen production technologies. In 
contrast,  countries  where  electricity  is  currently  generated  to  a  large 
extent from non-renewable resources (Ireland, The Netherlands, United 
Kingdom) and where the energy transition is expected to take further 
years,  could  either  bridge  this  time  gap  by  implementing  suitable 
bridging technologies or rely on renewable hydrogen imports, until the

national energy transition has proceeded further. Imports of renewable 
hydrogen may be a suitable long-term solution for a specific region, if 
the  local  potential  of  renewable  energy  sources  is  limited  due  to 
geographic, social, or technical constraints. Nevertheless, the impacts of 
hydrogen imports should be verified from an environmental perspective 
thereby  considering  also 
techno-economic  and  socio-economic 
constraints. 

5. Conclusions 

This study examines hydrogen production technologies with regard 
to  their  environmental  impact  to  identify  the  most  promising  short-, 
medium-, and long-term opportunities. The study is set into the context 
of the proceeding energy transition. Altogether, nine process configu-
rations based on four different process technologies, i.e., steam methane 
reforming  (SMR),  steam  methane  reforming  with  carbon  capture  and 
storage  (SMR-CCS),  methane  pyrolysis  (MP)  and  polymer  electrolyte 
membrane electrolysis (PEMEL), were analyzed. These technologies are 
often  associated  with  the  colors  grey,  blue,  turquoise,  and  green, 
respectively. Regional differences and future developments in national 
supply  chains  were  considered  to  assess  the  environmental  impact  of 
hydrogen production under the currently prevailing conditions as well 
as to anticipate recommended technology shifts and develop country- 
specific  recommendations.  For  this,  environmental  impacts  of  the 
hydrogen  production  technologies  were  analyzed  in  a  standardized 
manner by comparative life cycle assessment. 

Conventional  hydrogen  production  via  SMR  (“grey”)  shows  the 
highest impacts in the category climate change in most of the countries 
considered.  The  technology  relies  on  fossil  feedstocks,  leads  to  vast 
quantities  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  and  has  a  limited 
improvement  potential  in  terms  of  the  proceeding  energy  transition. 
Thus, to reach climate change mitigation targets, this technology ought 
to be considered to be substituted by alternative technologies. 

In the long run hydrogen production via PEMEL (“green”) shows the 
potential to emerge as the least harmful technology regarding climate 
change.  Hurdles  resulting  from  an  increasing  demand  for  water  and 
scarce materials needs to be overcome to fully justify the implementa-
tion  of  a  green  hydrogen  infrastructure.  Implementing  PEMEL  would 
lead to environmental co-benefits with decreasing impacts in 7 of the 16 
categories  considered.  Nevertheless,  it  would  also  result  in  burden 
shifting with increasing impacts in the remaining 9 categories. Note that 
6 of the 9 categories with increasing impact are characterized by a high 
level of uncertainty. Thus, improvements in the LCA and LCIA methods 
will be necessary to satisfactorily assess and fully understand the con-
sequences that result from the technology shift. For certain, utilizing the 
oxygen by-product for oxyfuel combustion and as industrial feedstock 

will enhance the environmental and economic performance of PEMEL 
further. Hydrogen production by PEMEL is highly sensitive to the un-
derlying electricity supply and, to be environmentally favorable, PEMEL 
requires a high share of renewable electricity sources in the electricity 
supply which has not yet been achieved in most national grid mixes. 

Hydrogen production via MP (“turquoise”) shows a lower impact in 
the  category  climate  change  than  SMR,  especially  if  the  carbon  by- 
product is utilized in industrial applications. Implementing MP would 
lead to considerable increases in all other environmental impact cate-
gories except climate change. Thus, there would be considerable burden 
shifting. Furthermore, most MP-based processes are still at an early stage 
of  development.  Accessible  qualities  and,  consequently,  the  market-
ability of the carbon by-product is as yet an unexplored field. 

Hydrogen  production  via  SMR-CCS  (“blue”)  has  a  higher  techno-
logical maturity, a lower impact in the category climate change and less 
significant  increase  in  the  remaining  impact  categories  than  MP.  The 
dependence on natural gas as a finite resource, and the necessity of long- 
term CO2 storage in limited suitable geologic storage sites restricts the 
suitability of SMR-CCS as a long-term solution. Nevertheless SMR-CCS 
may  be  an  interesting  bridging  technology  that  could  facilitate  the 
technology transition. 

Substituting conventional hydrogen production by either SMR-CCS 
or MP would cause burden shifting by increasing impacts in other cat-
egories except climate change. Regarding impact in the category climate 
change, both SMR-CCS and MP cannot compete with PEMEL based on 
renewably generated electricity. This ultimately limits their suitability 
as  long-term  solutions.  Nevertheless,  both  SMR-CCS  and  MP  could 
contribute to immediately lowering the impact in the category climate 
change associated with conventional hydrogen production and, thus, are 
possible bridging technologies. As such, these technologies may promote 
the  transition  from  hydrogen  production  from  fossil  resources  to 
hydrogen production from renewable resources in the near and medium 
term. 

Regional differences in electricity and natural gas supply chains lead 
to significantly deviating  scenarios when  assessing the  environmental 
impacts of hydrogen production technologies. Hydrogen production by 
PEMEL is highly sensitive to the underlying electricity supply and ben-
efits from a proceeding energy transition but is independent of natural 
gas.  Hydrogen  production  by  SMR, SMR-CCS,  and  MP  consume  large 
quantities  of  natural  gas  as  feedstock  or  heating  fuel  and,  thus,  are 
highly sensitive to the underlying natural gas supply chain, i.e., their 
proximity to natural gas deposits but are less sensitive to the supplied 
electricity  mix.  Accordingly,  at  which  point  hydrogen  production  by 
water  electrolysis  will  become  environmentally  favorable  will  signifi-
cantly  differ  for  each  country.  The  transformation  of  national  energy 
systems proceeds at different speeds. Natural gas deposits are unevenly

distributed around the world. The faster the national transition towards 
renewable electricity generation proceeds and the larger the distances to 
natural  gas  deposits  in  a  certain  region  are,  the  earlier  PEMEL  will 
overtake the other technologies considered here as the environmentally 
most favorable technology. 

After  all,  there  will  always  be  a  trade-off  in  choosing  the  most 
environmentally friendly way to generate hydrogen. Even though this 
trade-off depends on geographical and economic constraints, the polit-
ical will to harmonize energy policies and to substantially increase the 
share of RES in the grid mix is crucial for driving the energy transition 
towards green and sustainable hydrogen production, to secure the eco-
nomic viability and to protect the environment. Establishing technolo-
gies for producing hydrogen in an environmentally friendly way takes 
time  and  depends  on  the  corresponding  regulative  and  social  frame-
works. Weaving bridging technologies into national policies may help 
immediately mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. In addi-
tion  to  the  environmental  perspective  presented  here,  hydrogen  pro-
duction  pathways  should  also  be  elaborated  from  a  variety  of  other 
perspectives 
socio-economic 
considerations.

Matthias Hermesmann, M.Sc., studied Mechanical Engineering 
at  RWTH  Aachen  University  in  Germany,  and  University  of 
Sk¨ovde and Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, 
Sweden. He received his master´s degree in 2019 from RWTH 
Aachen University. Since 2019, he is PhD student at the Chair 
Carbon Sources and Conversion at Ruhr-Universit¨at Bochum, 
Germany.  His  strength  is  predictive  life  cycle  assessment, 
which  he  applies  for  assessing  the  environmental  impact  of 
sustainable  production  chains  in  the  chemical  industry.  His 
research  interests  comprise  evaluating  the  supply  and  inte-
gration  of  renewable  secondary  energy  sources  such  as 
hydrogen in prevailing chemical production chains by means 
of Power-to-X technologies.  

Prof. Dr. Thomas Ernst Müller (MRSC), having studied chem-
istry at LMU Munich, ETH Zurich and Imperial College London, 
received his PhD from Imperial College London in 1995. After 
positions  as  postdoctoral  fellow  at  the  University  of  Sussex, 
habilitation at the Technical University of Munich and visiting 
professor at the NUS Singapore (2005) and the University of 
Tokyo (2005), he took up the position as head of CAT Catalytic 
Center,  Covestro  Deutschland  AG  in  2007.  With  his  strong 
background  in  organometallic  chemistry  and  heterogeneous 
catalysis, he focuses on introducing innovative catalytic con-
cepts  in  industrial  processes.  He  envisions  building  a  bridge 
between basic research and industrial application. For this, he 
expanded CAT Catalytic Center to a leading research center at 
the interface between the industrial partner Covestro and the academic partner RWTH 
Aachen University. He then devoted himself at Covestro to the topics of innovation and IP 
protection as well as on evaluating modern chemical processes. From 2018 to 2019 he held 
the position as professor for process engineering at RFH Cologne and was appointed to the 
endowed  professorship  Carbon  Sources  and  Conversion  at  Ruhr-Universit¨at  Bochum  in 
March 2019. Key topics of his research concern establishing sustainable processes based on 
the  use of  renewable  raw materials  in the  energy  sector  and  in  chemical  industry.  His 
achievements include more than 80 publications in leading scientific journals as well as 
more than 70 patent applications in the areas of sustainability, CO2  chemistry, hydroge-
nation of multifunctional molecules and high-performance polymers.
