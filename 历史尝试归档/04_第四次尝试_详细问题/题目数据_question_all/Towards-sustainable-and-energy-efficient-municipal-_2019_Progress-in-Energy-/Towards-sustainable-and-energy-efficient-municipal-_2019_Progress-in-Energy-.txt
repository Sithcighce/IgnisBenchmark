In the last decades, energy scarcity has become an important issue globally. Renewable energy sources
have gained importance due to limited fossil fuel reserves and increased concerns on climate change. In
this regard, municipal wastewater is a remarkable energy source since huge amounts of wastewater are
generated and treated all over the world every day. Conventional activated sludge (CAS) process, which
has been in use for more than a century, is the most widely applied treatment method for municipal
wastewater. In spite of its reliability and proven success, CAS process suffers from intensive energy re-
quirement and lack of capability to capture a high amount of organic matter from wastewater. In order
to recover the energy present in wastewater efficiently, it is crucial to up-concentrate the organics in
wastewaters. Several physicochemical and biological processes may be employed for up-concentration of
organics and capturing them onto sludge. Capturing of organic matter in sludge phase allows improved
energy recovery through anaerobic digestion. This study aims to present a comprehensive evaluation of
the current practices applied to up-concentrate organic matter in municipal wastewater. The paper dis-
cusses the most frequently used up-concentration methods by addressing lab-scale and full-scale applica-
tions with typical operational parameters as well as providing their strengths and constraints. In addition,
various up-to-date treatment configurations are introduced in order to provide a future perspective in this
field.

1. Introduction

Rapid  population  increase  and  urbanization  have  led  to  an
increase  in  wastewater  generation;  thus,  sustainable  wastewater
treatment has gained importance in the last decades. Sustainable
wastewater  treatment  does  not  only  deal  with  water  reuse  and
recovery options, but also deals with recovery of energy and re-
sources,  i.e.,  nutrients.  Due  to  the  increase  in  energy  prices  and
depletion of nutrient sources, i.e., phosphorus rocks [1] , conven-
tional wastewater treatment must evolve into a more resource ori-
ented  concept.  This  paradigm  shift  has  led  to  the  perception  of
wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  as  resource  recovery  fa-
cilities where a number of products such as reusable water, en-
ergy in different forms (heat, electricity, fuel etc.), bioplastics, and
nutrients can be produced. In order to achieve energy neutrality
in  WWTPs,  innovative  treatment  technologies  are  needed  to  be
developed, which require less energy input for carbon and nutri-
ent removal [2] . This goal is also achievable by retrofitting existing
WWTPs as reported by Bertanza et al. [3] . Despite the remarkable
achievements in resource recovery in the last decades, WWTP op-
erators are still far from reaching this goal as shown in Papa et al.
[4] .

Wastewater  mainly  contains  two  types  of  energy:  chemical
and  thermal  energy.  Chemical  energy  potential  of  the  wastew-
ater  is  originated  from  its  organic  matter  content  and  it  is
available  in  chemical  bonds  of  organic  molecules  [5] .  Carbona-
ceous matter has the highest share in total energy content with
1.66 kWh/m 3  and  nitrogenous  matter  presents  an  additional  en-
ergy content of 0.30 kWh/m 3 [2] . Once the chemical bonds of the
organic molecules are broken, a certain amount of energy is re-
leased.  Chemically  bound  energy  content  of  municipal  wastewa-
ter can also be expressed per mass of chemical oxygen demand
(COD),  which  is  around  3.49 Wh/g  COD  or  12.6 kJ/g  COD  [6] .  In
fact,  the  COD  parameter  is  a  good  indicator  to  represent  en-
ergy recovery potential of wastewater and COD  concentration of
medium strength municipal wastewaters is typically between 400
and 500 mg/L [7] . COD concentration of municipal wastewaters can
be much lower in some regions where storm water and ground-
water  penetrations  are  high.  Thus,  some  precautions  should  be
taken  to  prevent  wastewater  dilution  in  sewers  [8] .  In  addition
to its chemical energy content, municipal wastewater itself is also
considered as a thermal energy source. Temperature of municipal
wastewater is almost fixed throughout a year [9] . Since wastewa-
ter is transported in sewer lines, change in ambient temperature
does not significantly affect the temperature of wastewater. Ther-
mal energy content of municipal wastewater is around 7 kWh/m 3
[10] and heat pumps can be run in order to recover this energy for
both heating and cooling purposes [9] . Annual municipal wastew-
ater generation holds around 70–140 GW of a continuous energy
supply all around the world with its oil equivalence of 52–104 mil-
lion tons of oil [11] .

A  comprehensive  study  was  conducted  by  Shizas  and  Bagley
[12] to determine energy content of raw municipal wastewater. The

results  showed  that  chemical  energy  content  of  the  wastewater
was about 3.2 kJ/g dry matter, which was 9.3 times higher than the
energy required for its treatment. Appropriate treatment technolo-
gies should be implemented to recover this energy potential [12] . It
was reported that available energy in municipal wastewater is four
times higher than the energy requirement of most widely applied
conventional activated sludge (CAS) processes for its treatment [2] .
The CAS processes are designed mainly to remove COD by apply-
ing an intensive aeration, and they are not principally designed for
energy recovery from the wastewater [13] . In order to recover the
chemical energy content of wastewater, anaerobic processes should
be implemented. By means of either anaerobic wastewater treat-
ment or sludge digestion, biogas is produced and energy recovery
can be achieved.

Municipal  wastewater  is  typically  characterized  with  medium
to  low  COD  content,  which  makes  its  direct  anaerobic  treat-
ment  less  feasible.  Some  advanced  technologies  can  be  adopted
to up-concentrate and increase COD concentration of the wastew-
ater  such  as  dynamic  sand  filtration  (DSF),  dissolved  air  flota-
tion  (DAF),  membrane  filtration,  and  biological  adsorption  [1] .
COD  capturing  from  municipal  wastewater  can  also  be  achieved
by  applying  chemically  enhanced  primary  treatment  (CEPT)  or
high  rate  activated  sludge  (HRAS)  processes  [14] .  An  organically
rich  sludge  can  be  obtained  with  an  up-concentration  process
and  the  concentrated  sludge  can  be  valorized  in  anaerobic  di-
gestion.  Increased  methane  production  can  decrease  the  energy
demand  of  WWTPs  and  provide  an  energy  efficient  wastewater
treatment [15] .

To  harvest  the  chemical  energy  from  municipal  wastewater,
the  organic  matter  content  of  the  wastewater  should  be  cap-
tured and anaerobically digested to produce biogas. This concept
can  be  achieved  efficiently  by  applying  alternative  methods,  i.e.
HRAS, CEPT or membrane bioreactor (MBR) process instead of CAS
technology,  for  concentrating  the  organic  matter  present  in  the
wastewater.  Within  this  view,  this  paper  presents  a  comprehen-
sive  evaluation  of  technologies  used  for  up-concentration  of  or-
ganics  enabling  maximum  energy  recovery  in  wastewater  treat-
ment.  Constraints  of  conventional  wastewater  treatment  systems
to recover the chemically bound energy in organic molecules were
discussed in this study. Several well-known, and innovative treat-
ment technologies were presented together with their fundamen-
tal backgrounds. Various operational experiences in both lab-scale
systems and large-scale WWTPs from the literature were assessed
in  order  to  demonstrate  the  advantages  and  drawbacks  of  the
introduced  treatment  systems.  By  this  way,  the  amount  of  or-
ganic  matter  that  can  be  captured  in  conventional  and  alterna-
tive wastewater treatment systems were compared. Energy recov-
ery  potential  of  up-concentrated  sludge  was  discussed  by  refer-
ring to anaerobic digestibility studies, providing methane yield of
different  excess  sludge  samples.  Differences  in  energy  recovery
potential  of  various  excess  sludge  treatment  systems  were  also
highlighted.

2. A brief overlook to common wastewater treatment
technologies and energy use in conventional WWTPs

In CAS processes, while the carbonaceous organic matter is con-
verted to CO
2 , the nitrogenous organic matter is hydrolyzed to am-
monium at first. Afterwards, ammonium is converted to nitrite and
nitrate by nitrification, and then nitrate is reduced to to nitrogen
gas by denitrification. The WWTPs designed for nitrogen and phos-
phorus removal are referred as biological nutrient removal (BNR)
plants.  Energy  requirement  for  phosphorus  removal  can  be  ne-
glected carbon and nitrogen removal [16] . High energy input for
aeration  is  the  most  important  drawback  of  CAS  and  BNR  pro-
cesses. Meerburg et al. [17] reported that the total electrical en-
ergy consumption of CAS plants is responsible up to 1% of total
national energy consumption in the developed countries. If the en-
ergy consumption of wastewater transfer within sewer lines and
entire treatment processes are included, this share can reach up
to 3% [2] . Aeration has the highest share in total energy require-
ment of WWTPs and can comprise up to 50–60% of the total en-
ergy consumption [18,19] . In terms of energy demand, aeration is
followed by sludge treatment process and pumping with 30% and
15% of the total energy consumption, respectively [19] . Anaerobic
digestion is the main energy consumer in sludge treatment pro-
cesses  [10,20]  and  it  is  followed  by  the  other  sludge  treatment
processes such as thickening, conditioning, dewatering, drying, de-
odorization, and operation of combined heat and power (CHP) gen-
eration plants [21] . Aerobic stabilization of excess sludge is another
important energy consumer process due to aeration requirement
and its energy consumption can be in similar magnitude with that
in anaerobic digestion. Moreover, some of the thickening and de-
watering  processes  such  as  DAF  and  centrifuge  have  higher  en-
ergy  consumption  compared  to  other  thickening  and  dewatering
methods [20] . In addition to electrical energy, several chemicals are
used in WWTPs and the embodied energy of these chemicals are
around 14% of the total electrical energy consumption [22] .

Current energy offset in WWTPs is generally based on valoriza-
tion of excess sludge through anaerobic digesters [23] . Biogas is the
principle product of anaerobic digestion which consists of mainly
methane (55–65%) and carbon dioxide (30–40%) as well as other
minor gases such as hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, siloxanes and wa-
ter vapor [24]. Energy recovery through anaerobic digestion varies
in a wide range depending on the applied sludge treatment tech-
nology  and  sludge  composition  [25] .  Excess  sludge  is  character-
ized  with  low  carbon  to  nitrogen  (C/N)  ratio  and  low  anaerobic
biodegradability; hereby, addition of carbonaceous rich wastes en-
hances the performance of anaerobic digestion [26] . There are sev-
eral  successful  applications  for  co-digestion  of  sludge  and  other
solid wastes. For instance, food waste [27] , olive waste [28] and
garden waste [29] have been asserted as co-substrates to enhance
process performance in anaerobic digestion. In addition to balanc-
ing  of  nutrients,  biogas  yield  and  biosolids  dewaterability  prop-

erties  can  be  enhanced  by  co-digestion  [30] .  Application  of  co-
digestion approach can close the energy gap of a WWTP, even can
provide energy positive wastewater treatment (up to 28% of en-
ergy surplus) [25] . Thermophilic sludge digestion that takes place
between  50  and  57  °C  is  another  alternative  to  achieve  energy
neutrality  in  WWTPs  [24] .  Jenicek  et  al.  [31]  stated  that  cou-
pling of sludge disintegration and thermophilic digestion in Prague
WWTP  (Czech  Republic)  increased  biogas  yield  by  50%  and  en-
ergy  self-sufficiency  of  the  plant  reached  over  70%.  Implement-
ing thermophilic anaerobic digestion could cover the whole energy
requirement  as  reported  in  Tilburg-Noord  WWTP  in  the  Nether-
lands [32] . Sludge pre-treatment methods such as ultrasonic, ther-
mal and temperature phased methods could also enhance methane
yield and improve energy efficiency of WWTPs [33] .

The  reduction  and  optimization  of  energy  consumption  in
WWTPs are carried out with benchmarking studies. The purpose
of benchmarking studies is to investigate the processes and prac-
tices  that  are  applied  in  energy  efficient  WWTPs  and  adopt  the
best management practices into the other WWTPs [34] . There is an
increased interest in benchmarking [35] and several studies have
been  conducted  in  order  to  enhance  energy  balance  of  WWTPs
by  applying  good  management  practices  [36] ,  i.e.,  sludge  diges-
tion and incineration [37] . Some countries, including Germany and
Switzerland, published energy manuals for WWTPs to illustrate en-
ergy balance more clearly [38] . Data quality and reporting are very
important to evaluate existing energy balance of WWTPs and pro-
pose upgrades [39] . Not only mass and energy balances on water
line but also on sludge line can highlight various upgrading options
for sludge management [40] .

Energy  consumption  in  WWTPs  is  based  on  several  parame-
ters such as applied treatment technology, equipment and mainte-
nance operations [10,21] . For a typical WWTP, energy consumption
is given between 0.3 kWh/m 3 and 2.1 kWh/m 3 of treated wastew-
ater [21] . Energy requirement increases as the treatment process
becomes more sophisticated. Energy requirement of different treat-
ment configurations are given in Table 1 .

Panepinto  et  al.  [21]  stated  that  advanced  biological  WWTPs
(applying  nutrient  removal  and  filtration)  consume  1.5  times
higher energy in comparison to CAS systems, which is in line with
the values in Table 1 . Rahman et al. [41] investigated different dis-
charge criteria for nutrients and they found that higher electric-
ity  and  chemical  consumption  are  required  to  meet  more  strin-
gent  discharge  criteria.  In  some  countries,  municipal  wastewater
can be reused after treatment, but more advanced treatment units
(i.e., desalination) should be applied in these cases, which increase
energy consumption of WWTPs significantly [42] . From this per-
spective, applied treatment technology and desired effluent qual-
ity have important impacts on energy balance of WWTPs. Proper
equipment selection, e.g., pumps, blowers and mixers [39] , as well
as regular maintenance of the equipment can enhance energy effi-
ciency of WWTPs [21] .

Reducing  aeration  energy  demand  is  the  most  concerned  is-
sue  in  improving  energy  balance  of  WWTPs.  Since  aeration  en-
ergy  (55–70%)  has  the  highest  share  in  total  energy  demand  of
a  typical  CAS  plant  [21] ,  using  modern  aeration  equipment  can
play  a  major  role  to  reduce  total  energy  demand  [16] .  Besides,
adjusting air input according to ammonia concentration in nitri-

fication through on-line monitoring can decrease aeration demand
[38] . On-line dissolved oxygen (DO) monitoring is an effective tool
for minimizing energy demand of aeration process. For instance,
DO monitoring and control at Käppala WWTP (Sweden) reduced
air  input  by  26%.  Setting  the  lowest  and  highest  DO  concentra-
tion  is  another  method  for  controlling  the  operation  of  aeration
equipment, which can decrease energy consumption between 15%
and  19%  [20] .  Nitrification  of  ammonia  consumes  an  important
amount of oxygen in WWTPs. Up to 50% of aeration energy drop
was reported after implementation of on-line ammonia control in
a WWTP  in the United Kingdom  [43] . A  similar monitoring and
control system resulted in 36% higher nitrogen removal and 19%
lower aeration energy at a WWTP in Connecticut (the USA) [44] .
Baroni et al. [45] implemented a fuzzy logic system on a full-scale
WWTP  in  Italy  and  fluctuations  of  ammonia  and  DO  concentra-
tions reduced significantly in the operation. By applying the fuzzy
controller  only  on  one  fourth  of  the  reactors,  4%  energy  saving
was attained in the WWTP. Using energy efficient pumps for in-
fluent wastewater pumping can also be taken into account to re-
duce energy consumption of WWTPs. By this way, between 5% and
30% of electricity saving can be achieved [46] . The benchmarking
studies conducted in Texas (the USA) showed that valorizing ex-
cess sludge through anaerobic digestion and incineration of the di-
gested sludge could reduce electricity consumption of WWTPs by
up to 27% and 83%, respectively [37] . Jonasson [34] reported that
Austria could succeed to decrease total energy demand in WWTPs
by  30%  in  2004  compared  to  1999  by  implementing  good  man-
agement practices in water line and improving sludge valorization
units.

BNR  process  increases  energy  requirement  of  WWTPs  due  to
the extra aeration demand of nitrification step [47] and additional
pump requirement for nitrate recycling. Innovative side and main-
stream nitrogen removal technologies can be introduced in order
to reduce energy demand for nitrogen removal. Coupling the in-
novative technologies with anaerobic sludge digestion can reduce
energy requirement drastically and even the whole WWTP can be
energy neutral [2] .

3. Proposed technologies for up-concentration of organics

3.1. High rate activated sludge (HRAS) process

CAS  process  is  a  very  old  treatment  technology,  which  cele-
brated its 100th anniversary in 2014 [48] . CAS process is the most
widely applied wastewater treatment technology; however, many
drawbacks and constraints have been realized in this process espe-
cially in terms of energy and resource recovery. These constraints
increase  operational  costs  and  induce  a  decline  in  the  potential
economic gain from energy and resource recovery [49] .

HRAS  system  seems  to  be  an  appropriate  treatment  alterna-
tive  in  comparison  to  CAS  system  by  means  of  carbon  and  en-
ergy recovery. HRAS process was revealed in 1923 at first [50] , but
it is still under development by implementation of good manage-
ment practices. The main remarks that make HRAS process differ-
ent from CAS process, are operational parameters such as sludge
loading rate, sludge retention time (SRT), and hydraulic retention
time  (HRT)  [50] .  HRAS  process  is  characterized  with  quite  high
sludge loading rates of 2 g BOD/g VSS/day, short SRT below 2 days
[49] and quite low HRT between 2 and 4 hours [50] . In contrast
to HRAS processes, a typical CAS process has a sludge loading rate
of around 0.25 g BOD/g VSS/day and an SRT greater than 10 days
[51] .  Low  aeration  requirement  to  remove  a  significant  portion
of  organic  constituents  in  wastewater  is  another  important  fea-
ture of HRAS systems [52] . Low energy consumption for aeration,
capturing  of  organic  matter  in  wastewater  through  adsorption
rather  than  mineralization  and  production  of  an  organically  rich

excess  sludge  make  the  HRAS  process  significantly  cost-efficient.
HRAS process can be applied for municipal wastewater treatment
as well as for industrial wastewater treatment [15,53] .

There  are  many  variants  of  HRAS  technology.  Adsorption-
Biooxidation (AB) process is the most well-known HRAS configu-
ration and it was developed by Böhnke in 1977 [54] . A-stage of
AB process is the high loaded part of the process, where high or-
ganic matter loading conditions exist. Nitrogen removal takes place
in the B-stage and long SRTs are applied to ensure nitrification and
denitrification [55] . High rate contact stabilization process (HiCS)
is another configuration of HRAS technology and it combines the
benefits  of  HRAS  process  and  contact  stabilization  [17,54] .  Oper-
ating membrane bioreactors (MBRs) under high loading but short
HRT conditions can be another variant of HRAS process [56,57] .

3.1.1. Biosorption and bioflocculation

Biosorption is the transfer of organic molecules in wastewater
onto sludge flocs [58] . During the biosorption, physicochemical re-
actions take place and occur very rapidly. Different COD fractions
require different durations to reach steady-state conditions in ad-
sorption. It was reported that to reach steady-state conditions for
colloidal  COD  adsorption,  less  than  20 min  is  sufficient,  whereas
around  40 min  is  required  for  soluble  COD  adsorption  [58] .  In  a
similar study, Kördel et al. [59] investigated the biosorption rates
of some specific organic matters (i.e., atrazine, linuron, fenthion, 4-
nitrobenzamide etc.) present in wastewater and they found longer
equilibrium times (between 2 and 6 hours) compared to those re-
ported by Guellil et al. [58] . The authors stated that biodegradabil-
ity is an important parameter that determines biosorbed fraction
of organic matters in a given time.

There  have  been  some  studies  for  understanding  the  mech-
anisms  of  organic  matter  removal  by  adsorption  or  biosorption.
Zhao  et  al.  [60]  set-up  a  lab-scale  contact  stabilization  treat-
ment  system  including  bioflocculation-adsorption,  sedimentation,
and stabilization processes to investigate organic matter removal
by physicochemical processes. They summarized the organic mat-
ter removal in three consecutive steps. The first step took a very
short time and colloidal matter was adsorbed onto the biomass.
Secondly, some portion of organic matter was released and it in-
creased  the  biochemical  oxygen  demand  (BOD)  concentration  in
the media. In the final step, a slight decline in BOD was observed
due to mineralization in the reactor. It should be emphasized that
while adsorption was the main driver in BOD reduction in the first
step, biological respiration was responsible for BOD reduction in
the third step.

The documentation about the COD adsorption capacity and rate
are not so detailed in the literature. The equations for adsorption
capacity and rate can be summarized below, respectively [61] ;

The adsorption rate of organic matters can be in various ranges
with  respect  to  loading  and  aeration  conditions.  In  the  batch
experiment of Tsiboe et al. [61] , COD adsorption rate and adsorp-
tion capacity were examined under different sludge storage con-
ditions. An important difference in both adsorption rates and ca-
pacities was determined for non-aerated and 4 hours pre-aerated

sludge. While the adsorption rate was 1.07 g COD/g TS/h for non-
aerated  sludge,  it  increased  up  to  5.03 g  COD/g  TS/h  after  aera-
tion. The adsorption rate did not increase further for 24 hours pre-
aerated sludge and it decreased to 4.01 g COD/g TS/h. It should be
pointed out that the given rates are maximum rates and began to
drop after 2 minutes of contact time. The study of Modin et al.
[52] helps to distinguish the adsorption of activated sludge based
on particles and dissolved organic matter. The reported rate coeffi-
cients for particles were quite higher than those of dissolved forms,
which  were  between  0.05–0.16 L/g  VSS/min  and  0.014–0.065 L/g
VSS/min, respectively.

2 /VSS and 244 mg O

SRT  is  another  operational  parameter  affecting  biosorption
yield. Rahman et al. [62] calculated the sorption yields of COD as
50 mg O
2 /VSS for SRTs of 2.2 and 0.8 d, re-
spectively.  It  was  found  that  until  a  threshold  SRT,  the  sorption
yield increased as SRT decreased. In their study, the sorption yield
was determined by conducting oxygen uptake rate (OUR) experi-
ments and the reported yields referred that mineralization played
an important role in sorption of organic matter. Reducing the SRT
from 0.8 to 0.2 d caused a slight decline in the sorption yield in
the same study, which indicated that the sorption capacity reached
saturation at 0.8 d and thus, this SRT was found to be optimum in
terms of favoring sorption yield.

COD fractionation is an important issue when dealing with the
biosorption.  By  considering  the  particle  size,  COD  can  be  cate-
gorized into three groups such as particulate, colloidal and solu-
ble  fractions.  Additionally,  colloidal  particles  can  be  divided  into
two sub-groups and the fraction that has larger particles can be
called supra-colloidal. According to Ødegaard [63] , the COD of mu-
nicipal wastewater consists of approximately 25% soluble (particle
size (cid:3) 0.08 μm), 15% colloidal (0.08–1.0 μm), 25% supra-colloidal (1–
100 μm) and 35% particulate ( (cid:4) 100 μm) fractions. On the other side,
it should be noticed that this distribution could vary for different
wastewaters. For instance, in another study, while total COD was
comprised of 60% of particulate COD, the shares of colloidal COD
and soluble COD fractions were measured as 17% and 23%, respec-
tively [50] . Guellil et al. [58] also reported the particulate, colloidal
and soluble COD fractions of municipal wastewater as 45%, 31% and
24%, respectively. In the same study, the authors investigated the
biosorbed COD fractions in a lab-scale biological treatment system
and found that about 45% of particulate fraction as well as 26% of
colloidal and 18% of soluble fractions could be adsorbed. The re-
sults indicated that not only particulate fraction but also colloidal
and soluble fractions could be adsorbed onto the biomass to some
extent.

Microbial flocculation (also can be referred as bioflocculation)
is an important step in activated sludge systems. Activated sludge
flocs should have an adsorption site for colloidal and soluble mat-
ters present in wastewater [64] . Different microbial products (i.e.,
poly- β-hydroxy butyric acid, nitrogen compounds, polysaccharides)
and uptake of metal ions affect surface charge of flocs and thereby,
bioflocculation properties [64] . Extracellular polymeric substances
(EPS)  play  a  key  role  in  the  bioflocculation  process  by  serving
as  flocculants  [65] .  Liao  et  al.  [66]  indicated  that  in  addition  to
amount of EPS, physical characteristics and composition of EPS are
also important in the bioflocculation mechanism.

Faust et al. [67] investigated the effect of SRT on bioflocculation
in a high loaded MBR and found that as SRT increased, biofloc-
culation  was  improved.  EPS-protein  concentration  was  found  to
be the most dominant fraction affecting the bioflocculation prop-
erties.  Bioflocculation  is  also  a  promising  process  to  concentrate
wastewaters such as grey water. The effect of SRT/HRT ratio on the
up-concentration of grey water was investigated by Hernandez Leal
et al. [65] . They applied different SRT/HRT ratios in a lab-scale MBR
and could concentrate the grey water from 1014 to 7233 mg COD/L
at an SRT/HRT ratio of 12. This shows that up-concentration of or-

150

ganic matter through bioflocculation can significantly improve car-
bon harvesting and energy recovery in anaerobic digestion.

There  is  a  threshold  for  the  minimum  SRT  in  order  to
keep  bioflocculation  at  sufficient  levels.  Ng  and  Hermanowicz
[56]  showed  the  relationship  between  SRT  and  bioflocculation
within the scope of EPS production in mixed liquor. Minimum 2
days of SRT was recommended for adequate bioflocculation. EPS
concentration can be regarded as an important parameter to mon-
itor bioflocculation; however, it should not be considered as the
only  parameter  regulating  bioflocculation.  The  structure  (soluble,
loosely bound and tightly bound) and components (i.e., polysac-
charides, proteins) of EPS also play a role in settling and biofloccu-
lation [68] . Experimental procedures to extract EPS, reactor con-
figuration,  type  and  strength  of  wastewater  may  also  lead  to
different  conclusions  about  the  effect  of  EPS  on  bioflocculation
[62] .

3.1.2. Sludge properties

From the point of solids-liquid separation in activated sludge
systems,  several  researchers  have  focused  on  floc  characteristics
and  sludge  properties.  Sludge  bulking  due  to  excessive  EPS  pro-
duction, filamentous biomass growth, and presence of small flocs
and dispersed biomass are given as the main causes of poor solids-
liquid separation [69] . To ensure efficient settling and compaction
of biomass in a reactor mixed liquor, large, dense and strong flocs
should exist. Liao et al. [70] concluded that large and dense flocs
always tend to have good settling and dewatering properties. Size
distribution and morphology are important in this regard to deter-
mine floc properties, which can vary profoundly depending upon
conditions in WWTPs [71] .

Due  to  the  different  operational  conditions  in  CAS  and  HRAS
processes, produced excess  sludges have different characteristics.
As mentioned previously, one of the main purpose of HRAS pro-
cess is to produce a more concentrated sludge in order to improve
energy production in the downstream processes of WWTPs. Espe-
cially for the parameters such as total suspended solids (TSS) and
COD, there are considerable differences between the excess sludges
of HRAS and CAS processes. Another important difference between
these two sludge types is the volatile solids content as expressed
by Cagnetta et al. [72] . Since HRAS sludge is much younger than
secondary sludge, its volatile organic matter fraction is generally
higher than that of secondary sludge. Cagnetta et al. [72] reported
VS content as 58% and 78% for secondary sludge and HRAS sludge,
respectively.

Operation conditions have also significant impacts on floc size
and  morphology  of  activated  sludge.  Typical  operating  parame-
ters such as DO, biomass concentration, organic loading rate (OLR)
and  SRT  can  affect  the  floc  size  and  thus,  settling  properties  of
sludge.  Liao  et  al.  [70]  found  that  median  floc  size  slightly  de-
creased  at  shorter  SRTs  (4  and  6  d)  and  shape  of  the  flocs  be-
came less uniform. They found that at longer SRTs (between 9 and
20 d), floc sizes were larger and floc size distribution (FSD) was
more stable. OLR and Food/Microorganisms ratio (F/M) are linked
to each other and alteration of substrate loading affects the floc
size distribution (FSD). The FSD at low loading conditions is rela-
tively lower than that at high loading conditions. Barbusinki and
Koscielniak  [73]  tested  different  OLRs  varying  between  0.17  and
1.8 kg COD/kg MLSS/day and concluded that decreasing of OLR to
around 0.26 kg COD/kg MLSS/day weaken floc structure suddenly
by  deteriorating  effluent  quality.  There  are  also  some  controver-
sial arguments about the relationship between high organic load-
ing  rates  and  the  floc  size  of  activated  sludge  such  as  given  by
Liao et al. [70] .

DO concentration is another parameter affecting the floc size
and its distribution. It was discovered that increase in DO concen-
tration led to a decrease in floc size. The pilot-scale experiments

conducted at an SRT of 1.25 days showed that reducing DO con-
centration from 2 mg/L to 0.5 mg/L resulted in an increase in floc
size and a reduction in sludge volume index (SVI) [74] . The ratio
of DO/(F/M) was also suggested as a parameter to get an indica-
tion  about  the  floc  size  [73] .  Some  studies  ascertained  that  SRT
could affect the floc size in activated sludge processes. Jin et al.
[71] made a comparison between several activated sludge samples
from different WWTPs having different SRTs (4–35 d) and reported
huge differences in floc sizes. In contrast to findings of Liao et al.
[70] , the largest mean floc size was measured in the sample from
a WWTP operated at an SRT of 4 days.

The  parameters  such  as  SVI  and  zone  settling  velocity  (ZSV)
are  highly  correlated  with  the  floc  size.  These  two  parameters
represent the compressibility and settleability of activated sludge.
High settleability and compaction of sludge refer high flocculation,
which coincides with low SVI and high ZSV [71] . The study of Se-
untjens et al. [75] showed that as the particle size increased, SVI
decreased  and  sludge  settling  properties  were  improved.  Kinyua
et  al.  [68]  operated  a  pilot-scale  HRAS  system  at  two  different
SRTs (0.28 and 0.56 d) and different DO concentrations in order
to observe treatment performance and sludge properties. The re-
sults showed that SVI was lower at the SRT of 0.28 d compared to
0.56 d regardless of DO concentrations. At the SRT of 0.28 d, DO
concentration had no remarkable effect on SVI, which was slightly
higher  than  50 mL/g.  SVI  can  be  used  as  an  indicator  to  deter-
mine improvement in COD and TSS removal efficiencies. The study
of Guven et al. [76] showed that improvement in effluent quality
in terms of COD and TSS concentrations was observed with a de-
crease in SRT. SVI was found to be lower than 50 mL/g throughout
the study, and the best effluent quality was observed when the SVI
reduced to around 20 mL/g. Shorter SRTs cause lower EPS produc-
tion and hereby, dewaterability characteristics of HRAS sludge are
superior than those in CAS sludge regarding capillary suction time
(CST) and required polymer dosage for dewatering [77] . Nonethe-
less, higher COD diversion to sludge in HRAS systems [78] and high
water content in sludge [79] may complicate dewatering process.
In contrast to organic substances, the presence of inorganic sub-
stances does not affect dewatering properties negatively. They can
even constitute a rigid structure in sludge matrix, which improves
dewatering. Inorganic coagulants (i.e., ferric chloride, alum, lime)
are found to be skeleton builders in dewatering which makes the
process easier [80] .

There  are  some  studies  focusing  on  the  relationship between
EPS and sludge settleability and compressibility, but further effort s
are  required  to  understand  the  effects  of  EPS  on  sludge  proper-
ties. Kinyua et al. [68] reported that 50–80% of the organic mat-
ter in activated sludge consisted of EPS. The constituents of EPS
were given as carbohydrate, protein, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA),
humic  substances  and  lipid  [66,69] .  EPS  intensity  is  an  impor-
tant  issue  in  HRAS  systems  and  its  production  changes  at  dif-
ferent  SRTs.  Jimenez  et  al.  [50]  monitored  EPS  production  at  a
pilot-scale HRAS system under different SRTs and stated that av-
erage EPS production increased linearly from 50 to 105 mg COD/g
VSS with increase in SRT from 0.3 to 1.0 d A similar correlation
was also found between DO and EPS concentrations. EPS produc-
tion  increased  with  increase  in  DO  concentration  from  0.5 mg/L
to  2.0 mg/L  at  an  SRT  of  1.0  day.  Rahman  et  al.  [62]  also  re-
ported similar results with two separate HRAS systems, a continu-
ous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a contact stabilization (CS) re-
actor. While average EPS production increased from 230 mg COD/g
VSS to 367 mg COD/g VSS with a change in SRT from 0.2 to 2.2 d
in the CSTR reactor, it increased from 258 mg COD/g VSS to 294 mg
COD/g VSS with a change in SRT from 0.4 to 0.8 d in the CS reac-
tor. Higher EPS production enhances bioflocculation, colloidal and
particulate COD removal efficiencies [50] as well as TSS removal
efficiency [66,81] .

3.1.3. Laboratory scale experiments

In the last decades, from energy recovery point of view, HRAS
systems have received a considerable attention [54,82] . In this re-
spect, extensive efforts have been dedicated to determine the opti-
mum operating parameters as well as to understand the behavior
of the microbial community under high loading conditions. Table 2
gives a summary of recent studies on HRAS process.

As seen from Table 2 , most of the studies about the HRAS pro-
cess  have quite  short  SRTs  and  HRTs,  which are generally lower
than 1.0 day and 60 min, respectively. This situation results in high
OLR and F/M values in the investigated studies. DO concentration
is  an  important  operational  parameter  addressed  in  the  studies.
DO concentration was generally kept below ∼2.0 mg/L as Kinyua
et al. [68] stated. The only exception was reported by Rahman et al.
[62] for the stabilization tanks of CS systems. Total COD removal
efficiencies of aerobic CAS processes can be up to 95% regardless
of the type of treated wastewater due to high HRTs [85] . The av-
erage total COD removal efficiency for HRAS system was between
40–70%  in  the  reported  studies  ( Table  2 ).  The  main  objective  of
HRAS process is to maximize energy recovery through capturing
COD  onto  the  sludge flocs  and mineralization of  COD  should  be
suppressed to divert more COD to sludge stream. From Table 2 , it is
seen that Kinyua et al. [68] found the total COD removal efficiency
as  around  68%,  and  46%  of  influent  COD  was  removed  through
adsorption. SRT is the main parameter determining adsorbed and
mineralized COD fractions. Jimenez et al. [50] investigated the ef-
fect of SRT on COD adsorption and found that COD captured on
sludge increased from 23% to 48% when the SRT decreased from
2.0 days to 0.3 days. Increase in COD capture is corresponded to
a decrease in mineralized COD. Ge et al. [15] reported the min-
eralized portions of influent COD at the SRTs of 4.0 and 2.0 days
as 50% and 25%, respectively. The correlation between SRT and the
fate of influent COD in the treatment shows that COD capture on
sludge and hence, energy recovery through anaerobic digestion is
higher in HRAS in comparison to that in CAS process. It should be
noticed that the given percentages for COD capture on sludge and
COD  mineralization are study  specific  values and  are  not  only  a
function of SRT but also several other parameters such as wastew-
ater characterization (particle size distribution and biodegradabil-
ity of organic matter) and DO level in the operation and reactor
configuration.

At very short SRTs, slow growing microorganisms cannot sur-
vive  and  only  fast  growing  microorganisms  can  maintain  their
metabolic  activities.  Some  portion  of  COD  may  not  be  degraded
by  the  selected  microorganisms  in  HRAS  systems  and  can  be
regarded  as  inert  COD.  Haider  et  al.  [86]  measured  inert  COD
concentrations  as  67  and  28 mg/L  in  the  effluent  of  two  differ-
ent activated sludge systems operated at SRTs of 0.4 and 1.0 day,
respectively.  In  other  respect,  it  should  be  noted  that  the
biodegradability of organic matter is mainly related to its chem-
ical  structure  rather  than  operational  parameters  in  the  treat-
ment process. The study of Haider et al. [86] was conducted on
the applicability of Activated Sludge Model No.1 (ASM1) at short
SRTs. It was found that effluent COD concentration increased when
SRT decreased from 1.0 to 0.4 dayspossibly due to an increase in
biodegradable COD rather than the increase in non-biodegradable
COD. Jimenez et al. [50] applied short SRTs in a HRAS process and
found that 0.1 days of SRT was not suitable in terms of soluble
and particulate COD removal efficiencies. They observed that max-
imum soluble COD removal efficiency was achieved at SRT > 0.5 d
and  HRT > 15 min.  In  the  same  study,  it  was  also  expressed  that
there was a strong correlation between SRT and effluent COD frac-
tion. While the particulate COD removal was limited ( < 20%) at the
SRTs shorter than 0.3 d, it approached to 80% at the SRTs greater
than 1.5 d One of the significant aspects about HRAS process is
about the calculation of SRT in the system. Despite the reduction

of effluent TSS concentrations till around 50 mg/L in A-stage treat-
ment [62,68] , higher concentrations than those measured in CAS
systems might be encountered in some cases [84,87] . When high
concentrations of TSS leave the system via effluent, calculating the
actual SRT can be somehow tricky. The SRT, that is calculated by
taking into account both wasted sludge and washed out TSS, can
be defined as corrected SRT as Haider et al. [86] proposed. Washed
out TSS can be an important factor in operation of HRAS systems
in terms of SRT control. No sludge wasting from final clarifier is
sometimes required to control SRT when effluent TSS is in consid-
erable amount [62] . It should be noted that optimized sludge sep-
aration in the final clarifiers is very critical from energy recovery
point of view [54] .

Ge et al. [15] applied short SRTs and HRTs for the treatment
of slaughterhouse wastewater that had total COD and soluble COD
concentrations  of  2900 mg/L  and  1000 mg/L,  respectively.  In  that
study,  loading  conditions  were  comparable  with  HRAS  process
while SRTs and HRTs were higher than those reported in the stud-
ies  given  in  Table  2 .  While  the  SRTs  were  between  2.0  and  3.8
d, the HRTs varied between 0.5 and 1.0 d It was shown that the
minimum removal efficiencies for total and soluble COD were 85%
and 72%, respectively. The results revealed that removal efficien-
cies did not change significantly under different operating condi-
tions. The striking finding about the study was the degree of COD
oxidation,  which  was  doubled  when  the  SRT  increased  from  2.0
to 3.8 d. 50% of total influent COD was mineralized at the SRT of
4 days. The study of Rahman et al. [62] also showed the similar
trend between SRT and oxidized COD fraction in HiCS configura-
tions, whereas they observed no drastic change in oxidized COD
fractions at different SRTs (from 0.4 to 0.8 d). Furthermore, it was
exhibited that biosorption of COD increased and biomass synthesis
decreased with the reduction of SRT in HiCS configurations.

Nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency of HRAS process is
generally low since it is mainly designed for carbon removal. De-
spite this, there can be nitrogen and phosphorus removals to some
extent by means of settling of particulate forms and biological as-
similation [50] . The study of Ge et al. [82] showed that total ni-
trogen (TN) removal of 14.6%-49.6% and total phosphorus (TP) re-
moval of 8.1%-34.2% could be attainable in a HRAS system operated
under low SRTs (0.6 and 2.9 d).

Carbon  capture  from  wastewater  is  one  of  the  key  issues  in
energy efficient wastewater treatment. Routing organic carbon to
sludge stream as much as possible is a key approach for energy
recovery through anaerobic digestion. It also leads to less miner-
alization, and thus reduces the aeration demand that is the most
energy  consuming  process  in  wastewater  treatment  [14] .  Carbon
redirection and carbon harvesting have become very popular phe-
nomena in this context. Several studies have focused on capturing
organic content of wastewater in excess sludge [14,62] and valoriz-
ing it in further treatment steps that can recover energy to a con-
siderable extent [17] .

Carbon redirection aims the maximization of energy recovery,
but there should be a tradeoff between COD capture by biomass
and oxidized COD in order not to compromise to meet discharge
criteria  [50] .  SRT  is  suggested  as  the  main  operating  parameter
to control and minimize oxidized COD fraction in activated sludge
systems. Short HRT and SRT provide less oxidation of organic mat-
ter  while  deducting  the  aeration  requirement.  These  parameters
also boost the transfer of organic matter to the biomass [15] . For
this  reason,  oxygen  consumption  per  removed  organic  matter  is
less in HRAS systems in comparison to that in CAS systems [52] .
Miller et al. [83] found the average oxygen consumption as 0.22 kg
removed  in a  lab-scale HRAS  system,  whereas  it  could
O
2 /kg  COD
be 0.70 kg O
removed  in CAS systems (at an SRT of 10 d)
[88] . Chan et al. [89] stated that the biodegradability of sludge de-
creased by 10% for each additional day at short SRTs. Therefore,

shorter SRTs produce more biodegradable excess sludge; however,
very short SRTs ( ∼0.1 d) are not found suitable due to the decrease
in COD diversion to sludge and effluent quality [50] .

Treatment  efficiency  of  HRAS  systems  is  generally  evaluated
with removal of different COD fractions. The COD oxidation degree
is an important performance indicator of HRAS processes and the
oxidation should be minimized as much as possible [54] . In a lab-
scale study of Meerburg et al. [17] , in which a synthetic wastewa-
ter having 800 mg/L of COD was treated, the effect of SRT and HRT
on the removal efficiency of different COD fractions were investi-
gated. A high rate CS system was operated as SBR in the study. Un-
der all operational conditions, particulate COD removal efficiencies
were in the same range and between 80–93%. The highest solu-
ble COD removal efficiency was 34% at 1.3 d of SRT and 40 min of
HRT (stabilization time). The removal efficiency decreased sharply
till 5% at below 1.0 day of SRT and 15 min of HRT, which was likely
due to very limited mineralization of soluble COD at such a short
HRT  [17] .  Regarding  the  relationship  between  COD  removal  effi-
ciency and mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration in
a bioreactor, Miller [90] concluded that MLSS concentration was
not a limiting factor in A-stage and COD removal efficiency was
not improved for the higher MLSS concentrations than 30 0 0 mg/L.

3.1.4. Full-scale applications

The first full-scale HRAS plants started to serve about 40 years
ago. Systems including HRAS process (e.g., AB process) have been
largely employed in some European countries including Germany,
Austria and the Netherlands. There are also some plants in China
applying this treatment technology [91] . USA, Sweden, Spain, Korea
and Denmark are the other countries that have full-scale AB plants
[51] .  While  the  total  numbers  of  plants  were  only  five  in  1985
[55] , it has reached about fifty in the last decade [87] . Meerburg
[51] listed the full-scale AB plants around the world. Blue Plains
Advanced WWTP (Washington DC, USA, (CEPT + A-stage + B-stage))
was reported as the largest installation with a design capacity of 6
million population equivalence (PE).

The first full-scale plant employing AB process was constructed
in  the  second  half  of  1970 s  and  put  into  operation  in  1981  at
Krefeld WWTP (Germany). The average flowrate of the plant was
143,0 0 0 m 3 /day and half of the flow was originated from industrial
sources. The capacity of the plant was enlarged to 180,0 0 0 m 3 /day
in 1993. Depending on the intrusion of high industrial effluents,
wide fluctuations were reported in influent wastewater character-
ization.  It  was  seen  that  the  AB  process  was  very  successful  to
meet the discharge limits while treating such a wastewater having
high amount of industrial discharge [92] . After the construction of
Krefeld WWTP, new WWTPs having the similar configuration have
been built in Germany. Table 3 summarizes the operational data
of five full-scale AB plants, which were the first examples at full-
scale. The table shows that the removal efficiency of BOD varied
between 44% and 62% in the A-stage. The following B-stage is ca-
pable of reducing the BOD concentration below 10 mg/L and the
COD concentration to 60 mg/L at all plants [55] .

Strass WWTP (Austria) is one of the good examples of success-
ful  AB  plants.  The  maximum  capacity  of  the  plant  was  220,0 0 0
PE  [6] .  While  the  high  loaded  A-stage  has  an  SRT  of  0.5  days,
the  low  loaded  B-stage  has  a  target  SRT  of  10  days  enabling
nitrogen  removal.  The  energy  self-sufficiency  of  the  plant  was
reported  as  112%  in  2006,  which  is  the  most  remarkable  point
about the plant [38] .

There  are  also  a  number  of  AB  plants  in  the  Netherlands.
Rotterdam-Dokhaven WWTP  is  one  of  the  first  AB  plants  in  the
country and it began operating at the end of 1980s– [93] . The op-
erational data of the A-stage of four AB plants in the Netherlands
were investigated and a design guideline was proposed to increase
energy  efficiency  of  the  process  [87] .  Comparison  of  operational
data for the investigated WWTPs is given in Table 4 .

As discussed above, the main distinction of the A-stage from
CAS  system  is  high  volumetric  and  sludge  loadings.  The  sludge
loading rates vary between 2.2–3.5 g BOD/g MLSS/day in the four
Dutch WWTPs as given in Table 4 . At Krefeld WWTP, while the
loading rate of the A-stage was 4.3 g BOD/g MLSS/day, it decreased
to 0.13 g BOD/g MLSS/day at the B-stage to maintain nitrogen re-
moval.  Loading  rates  of  2.7 g  BOD/g  MLSS/day  and  0.3 g  BOD/g
MLSS/day were applied at the A-stage and B-stage, respectively in
Dokhaven WWTP [55,93] . Considering Table 4 , MLSS concentration
in the A-stage was between 1.4 and 2.6 g/L and discharge criteria
for the phosphorus parameter could be met by adding various fer-
rous solutions into the A-stage.

Extremely short SRTs and HRTs are also applicable in AB pro-
cess configuration. According to the operational data of four Dutch
AB plants, while the SRTs were between 0.30 and 0.65 d, the HRTs
were in the range of 24 min to 51 min [87] . Although the SRTs of
Dutch plants ( Table 4 ) are below the recommended value (2 d) to
sustain sufficient bioflocculation [56] , these WWTPs are operated
with a high efficiency. This suggests that operational results from
full-scale  reactors  may  be  different  from  the  conclusions  drawn
from lab-scale reactors. Moreover, as noted previously, the extent
of bioflocculation does not rely on only SRT parameter. SRT and
loading rates applied at the B-stage are generally comparable with
CAS systems with nutrient removal. It was reported that the SRT
of the B-stage was kept around 10 days in Strass WWTP in order
to achieve sufficient nitrogen removal [38] .

Full-scale  operational  experience  of  AB  plants  proved  that  A-
stage is very successful in buffering organic shock loadings as well
as  pH  variations  and  toxic  loadings.  This  is  of  great  importance
especially for WWTPs receiving high flows of industrial effluents.
For  example,  20  days  of  operational  data  of  Krefeld  WWTP  re-
vealed that effluent COD concentration could be stably kept below
60 mg/L although the sludge load at the A-stage occasionally has
risen to about 60 g BOD/g MLSS/day [55] .

3.1.5. Modeling studies

Modeling  of  activated  sludge  processes  is  a  beneficial  tool  to
understand the biological interactions in wastewater treatment and
improve performance of WWTPs. In WWTPs, by employing an SRT

longer than 5 days, almost whole biodegradable matter is degraded
and  effluent  COD  is  mostly  consisted  of  inert  soluble  COD  [86] .
This  assumption  is  not  acceptable  for  HRAS  process,  which  has
quite lower SRTs in comparison to CAS systems. Under these condi-
tions, only some fast growing bacteria, which can grow on readily
biodegradable organic matter, can survive [94] . Slow growing bac-
teria cannot thrive under the operation conditions of HRAS systems
and are washed out from the reactor [86] . Due to the limitations
about estimations of adsorbed and mineralized fractions of organic
matter at very short SRTs, standard activated sludge models do not
fit well in HRAS systems modeling [82] .

Adsorption and bioflocculation of organic matter are very im-
portant mechanisms in HRAS processes [50] . In contrast to HRAS
systems,  inclusion  of  these  mechanisms  do  not  have  a  prior-
ity in the modeling studies carried out for activated sludge sys-
tems  operated  at  long  SRTs.  Due  to  the  lacking  of  biofloccula-
tion and adsorption processes in the Activated Sludge Model No.1
(ASM1),  particulate  and  colloidal  COD  (pCOD  and  cCOD)  are  as-
sumed to be removed completely and the high cCOD concentra-
tion in the effluent of HRAS systems cannot be explained. More-
over, current models overestimate the removal efficiency of soluble
COD (sCOD) in HRAS process since sCOD is removed partially at
short SRTs [94] . Overlooking of some important issues that are to
be intrinsic for HRAS process, development of new mathematical
models or modification of the activated sludge models (i.e., ASM
models) is necessary. Optimization of HRAS systems via modeling
can help to determine optimal SRT and to maximize energy recov-
ery from excess sludge generated from the process [54] .

Growth and decay of biomass, ammonification of organic nitro-
gen, and hydrolysis of particulate organics are the basic processes
that are taken into account in the ASM1. In these processes, vari-
ous state variables for soluble and particulate matters are consid-
ered  [95] .  No  state  variables  for  colloidal  organic  matter  are  in-
cluded in the ASM1. Nogaj et al. [94] introduced two new terms
named as colloidal biodegradable organics and non-biodegradable
organics in the ASM1 to develop a new mathematical model for
HRAS systems. The colloidal biodegradable organics are adsorbed
onto particulate biodegradable organics and then transformed into
slowly biodegradable soluble organics. The non-biodegradable frac-
tion of COD leaves the system without any conversions [52] . Smit-
shuijzen et al. [96] also conducted a study on modeling of A-stage
and they used the same state variables given in the ASM1. In con-
trast to the study of Nogaj et al. [94] , they did not prefer to define
separate variables for colloidal fractions for simplicity. The descrip-
tion  of  the  adsorption  process  was  also  expressed  differently  in
these two studies. It was defined as a kinetic process (with a rate
coefficient of 0.07 day −1 ) by Nogaj et al. [94] . A lumped param-
eter called f
settler  (0.984 on average) was developed by Smitshui-
jzen et al. [96] , which represented the removed fraction of slowly
biodegradable organics.

Determination of kinetic parameters plays a significant role in
the activated sludge modeling since these parameters have key role
in WWTP design [97] . Respirometric tests are the most common
applications  for  measuring  both  kinetic  and  stoichiometric  coef-
ficients [98] . Respirometry can also be used to identify different
COD fractions in wastewaters [99] . The most important parameters
in WWTP modeling and design can be given as follows: Maximum
specific growth rate, endogenous decay rate, sludge yield and sub-
strate half saturation (affinity) constant [97] . In Table 5 , some sto-
ichiometric  and  kinetic  parameters  used  in  the  ASM1  and  those
developed for modeling of the HRAS process are given.

As  shown  in  Table  5 ,  heterotrophic  yield  for  HRAS  process
model is slightly lower than that of ASM1 and taken as 0.5 g COD/g
COD. Sludge yield for CAS systems is provided in a wide range in
the literature. Hadei et al. [97] reviewed the kinetic coefficients of
activated  sludge  modeling  and  reported  biomass  yields  between
0.3 g VSS/g COD and 1.78 g VSS/g COD. Rahman et al. [62] calcu-
lated sludge yields of a lab-scale CSTR system that was operated
under three different SRTs and reported as 0.45, 0.47 and 0.54 g
COD/g COD at 2.2, 0.8 and 0.2 d, respectively. It can be concluded
that the average sludge yield of this study agrees well with the
value proposed by Smitshuijzen et al. [96] .

The difference between CAS system and HRAS system with re-
spect to sludge yield was also investigated by conducting lab-scale
experiments. It can be noticed that sludge yield increases as SRT
decreases [49] meaning that higher amount of organic material can
be transferred to sludge at short SRTs. Meerburg et al. [49] oper-
ated a high rate CS under four different SRTs varying from 0.24 to
2.8 d and the results showed that while sludge yield was around
0.6 g COD/g COD at 2.8 d, it increased above 1.0 g COD/g COD at
0.24 days. Meerburg et al. [54] investigated the effect of both long
and short SRTs on sludge yield. While sludge yield was 0.25 g TSS/g
COD
removed at
1.1 d

removed at 12 days, it reached up to 0.80 g TSS/g COD

The differences in reported sludge yields showed the difficul-
ties in evaluating the results of respirometry studies, which was
also mentioned by Lagarde et al. [99] . Consequently, while sludge
yield is higher and half saturation constant is lower in compari-
son to those in CAS systems, maximum specific growth rate and
endogenous decay rate are in the same range with those in CAS
systems. It should also be noted that with respect to the magni-
tude of the kinetics, maximum specific growth rate was found to
be more dominant on the active biomass fraction in comparison to
endogenous decay rate at very short SRTs [100] .

As noted previously, HRAS process is characterized with high
loading rates and high sludge yields. Meerburg et al. [54] showed
that  sludge  yield  of  HRAS  process  was  significantly  higher  than
that  of  CAS  system.  Short  SRTs  promote  sludge  yield;  however,
there is a threshold for the minimum SRT, and sludge yield does
not increase further beyond this lower limit. The study of Jimenez

et al. [50] showed that sludge yield increased gradually as SRT de-
creased from 2 to 0.3 d When SRT decreased from 0.3 to 0.1 d, a
slight decline in sludge yield was observed. Limited bioflocculation
was suggested as the reason for the decrease in sludge yield at 0.1
d It can be attributed to poor bioflocculation due to the low EPS
production under extremely short SRTs [62] .

3.2. Chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) process

CEPT process is the addition of coagulants to bring suspended
particles  together  in  order  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  primary
settling tanks [101] . Researchers have given many different names
to  CEPT  process  such  as  chemically  assisted  primary  sedimenta-
tion  (CAPS),  chemically  enhanced  primary  sedimentation  (CEPS),
chemically enhanced mechanical treatment (CEMT) and advanced
primary treatment (APT) processes [102,103] . A typical layout for
CEPT process is provided in Fig. 1 .

Sarparastzadeh et al. [103] reported that CEPT process required
only  the  half  of  the  area  of  the  conventional  primary  sedimen-
tation.  This  issue  is  very  substantial  for  the  megacities  where
the WWTPs are surrounded by residential and commercial zones
and there is a very limited space for plant extension. Sustainable
and cost-effective solutions should be proposed for these regions
[105,106] . CEPT process is also characterized with low energy re-
quirement, simple operation and maintenance, high treatment ca-
pacity  and  high  removal  efficiencies  [107] .  Thus,  it  makes  CEPT
process an interesting treatment option particularly for megacities
[108] . In contrast to this argument, Guan et al. [109] claimed that
introduction of chemicals to primary treatment could lead to an in-
crease in operational costs; however, recovery of alum (Al
3 )
rich sludge was encouraged to reduce operational costs.

2 (SO

Conventional  treatment  processes  cannot  meet  the  hydraulic
peak  loads  during  intensive  rain  conditions  so  bypass  lines  are
required to discharge excess loads without any treatment. Mouri
et  al.  [102]  suggested  applying  CEPT  process  in  regions  where
flood risk exist, since it has the capability to treat whole wastewa-
ter during extreme weather conditions. If the operating conditions
are optimized, it was reported that 151–168 m/day of surface over
flowrates (SORs) at peak hours are attainable in CEPT process [110] .

Especially  for  the  touristic  areas,  overloads  can  be  a  problem  in
certain periods during the year. Capability of CEPT process to re-
sponse overloads may bring a solution for this problem [111] . The
WWTPs that receive industrial discharges can also be retrofitted
with the CEPT concept to minimize the adverse effects of indus-
trial wastewater inputs [112] . Despite many benefits of CEPT pro-
cess, sludge production related to the process and chemical costs
for coagulation are the main drawbacks of it [102] .

Applicability of CEPT process can also be determined by con-
ducting a life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis. It was stated that
CEPT  process  contributes  improving  water  quality,  reducing  CO
2
emissions and energy consumption in aerobic treatment processes.
From a LCA perspective, CEPT process is an eco-friendly treatment
process in wastewater management [102] .

CEPT  process  can  be  regarded  as  an  efficient  way  to  remove
the non-soluble fraction in primary wastewater treatment systems
[102] . Removal of TSS may also increase the performance of sub-
sequent biological treatment processes such as up-flow anaerobic
sludge blanket (UASB) process. Slow hydrolysis of suspended solids
causes  solids  accumulation  especially  in  UASB  systems  without
heating and this accumulation negatively influences methanogenic
activity  of  the  anaerobic  biomass.  Soluble  COD  to  volatile  sus-
pended solids (VSS) ratio is given as a critical operating parameter
to perform UASB process successfully. CEPT process can increase
this ratio to an acceptable range, which improves the process per-
formance [113,114] . Coupling of CEPT with other treatment configu-
rations was also suggested in the study of Diamantis et al. [115] , in
which 20 mg Fe 2 + /L was dosed to raw wastewater prior to a lab-
scale HRAS system. The results showed that adding iron slightly
enhanced soluble COD removal and more importantly, more than
95% of phosphorus could be removed.

One of the most important advantage of CEPT process is to min-
imize organic load for subsequent biological processes in WWTPs
[116] .  When  the  volumetric  load  (B v )  and  F/M  ratio  are  exam-
ined, it can be clearly seen that both of the these parameters de-
creased in case of performing CEPT process compared to conven-
tional primary clarifiers as demonstrated by Nenov [111] . They im-
plied that while B v  and F/M of an activated sludge plant (having
an HRT of 1 h and MLSS concentration of 20 0 0 mg/L) were 3.50 kg

156

BOD/m 3 /d and 1.75 kg BOD/kg MLSS/d, respectively following con-
ventional  primary  treatment,  after  introducing  CEPT  process,  B v
and F/M were decreased to 2.06 kg BOD/m 3 /d and 1.03 kg BOD/kg
MLSS/d, respectively. The reported values proved that implemen-
tation of CEPT process reduced the organic load in the subsequent
activated sludge systems. The effluent quality was also improved in
the same study [111] . Apart from the enhancement in the effluent
quality,  hydraulic  capacity  could  be  increased  since  the  required
foot-print decreased [116] . The reduction of organic load to sub-
sequent biological processes results in a decrease in the required
reactor size. It reduces the aeration tank size for carbon removal
as well as for nitrification.

In  CEPT  process,  larger  flocs  are  formed  and  these  flocs  are
prone to settle faster [117] . The treatment efficiency also increases
with the increase of floc size significantly. According to a survey
study done with 100 WWTPs in the USA, CEPT process has suc-
cessfully removed 85% and 57% of TSS and BOD, respectively. Re-
ported  removal  efficiencies  were  lower  in  conventional  primary
treatment systems which are only 50–70% for TSS [104] and 30%
for COD [5,16] . Satisfying COD removal efficiencies are also achiev-
able  in  CEPT  process.  Kalogo  and  Verstraete  [114]  conducted  a
study on a CEPT process for a period of 180 days and reported that
46% of total COD and 28% of soluble COD were removed on aver-
age. Much higher COD and SS removal efficiencies were also at-
tained such as 76% and 85%, respectively [113] . The impact of poly-
mer addition in COD removal has also been investigated by some
researchers. Yu [118] obtained 20% higher COD removal efficiency
by adding a metal salt and an anionic polymer together in compar-
ison with adding the metal salt solely. It should be noted that there
are also contradictory results in some studies, which pointed out
that addition of polymer does not contribute to the performance
in each case [119] . In CEPT process, soluble COD can also be re-
moved to some extent in addition to particulate COD. It enhances
the  transfer  of  COD  from  the  liquid  phase  to  the  sludge  phase.
Yagci et al. [13] reported that 79% of total influent COD passed into
the sludge phase. It is a remarkable merit from the point of energy
recovery.

3.2.1. Coagulant selection

It is important to select the most appropriate coagulant type
and  dosage  in  CEPT  systems.  There  are  some  aspects  in  this  is-
sue such as maximizing the COD reduction, minimizing the neg-
ative  effects  on  the  following  biological  processes,  easy  imple-
mentation and chemical costs. As a well-established method, jar
tests should be conducted in order to select the coagulant and its
dosage that will be used in wastewater treatment. Different coag-
ulants in different dosages are applied in jar tests for this purpose
[105] . Jar test is also beneficial to select the most suitable coagu-
lant/flocculant combination [113] .

4 )

2 (SO

3 ) and ferric chloride (FeCl

Colloids  in  wastewater  generally  have  high  stability,  which
causes them to repel each other [103] . Cationic substances should
be applied to neutralize the negative charges on colloid surfaces
and remove the stability in the suspension. These cations could be
either inorganic or organic substances. Inorganic coagulants such
as alum (Al
3 ) are the most preva-
lent coagulants used in CEPT process [120] . Besides, different raw
materials such as fly ash could be used as well [121] . Increase in
sludge production due to the use of inorganic coagulants should
not be overlooked and it should be considered for sludge disposal.
Sludge production is higher in chemical precipitation in compari-
son to conventional primary sedimentation. Thus, avoiding excess
sludge generation is an important optimization issue. Yagci et al.
[13]  emphasized that  utilization  of  polyaluminum  chloride  (PAC)
causes less sludge generation in comparison with conventional co-
3 . Ødegaard [63] offered an equation for the
agulants such as FeCl
total sludge production for chemically assisted sedimentation pro-

cesses as follows:

SP = S S in − S S out + K prec D

where

(3)

SP = Sludge production (g SS/m 3 )
SS

in , SS out = Suspended solids concentration in the influent and
effluent (g SS/m 3 )

K prec = Sludge  production  coefficient  (g  SS/g  Metal),  4–5  for

Fe 3 + and 6–7 for Al 3 +

D = Dosage of metal coagulant (g Metal/m 3 )

It  was  reported  that  alum  does  not  provide  a  higher  surface
overflow rate and a better removal efficiency in settling tanks com-
pared to lime [117] . In addition to that, the dewaterability of alum
sludge is more troublesome. The lab-scale study of Sarparastzadeh
et al. [103] makes a comparison between ferric chloride and alum
by  means  of  the  treatment  performance.  In  terms  of  COD  and
phosphorus  removals,  using  alum  showed  a  worse  performance
compared to ferric chloride.

Organic coagulants could bring a solution for extra sludge pro-
duction since they do not lead to too much sludge production com-
pared to inorganic coagulants [120] . Polyamines and chitosan are
some of the examples for organic coagulants. Especially, chitosan
has a wide spread application for many types of wastewater [104] .
Some organic residues such as plant seeds and husks can also be
used as coagulants [114] . In spite of the advantages of organic co-
agulants, the previous studies about using them solely showed that
removal efficiencies are not as high as inorganic (metal) coagulants
[63] . The other constraint about organic coagulants is the elevation
of sCOD in the treated wastewater [114] .

3.2.2. Optimum dosage determination

Optimization  of  coagulant  dosage  is  crucial  in  CEPT  process
[103] .  To  avoid  excess  dosage  of  chemicals  is  also  important  for
minimizing sludge production and thus, reducing the sludge dis-
posal cost [105] . As described above, an experimental procedure
called jar test is carried out to determine the optimum dose of co-
agulant [122] . Six identical beakers are used in a typical jar test
and different amounts of coagulants are added to each beaker. Af-
ter mixing and settling, the supernatants of the samples are taken
and some analyses (i.e., turbidity, suspended solids) are performed
on the supernatants to determine the optimum coagulant dosage
[123] .

The recently conducted jar test studies focused on the determi-
nation of the most appropriate coagulant dosages and mixing con-
ditions. Researchers have carried out different coagulant dosages
up to 500 mg/L [13] ; however, the concentrations around 500 mg/L
is too high and the optimum concentration was generally found to
be lower than 100 mg/L ( Table 6 ). As an indicator, several param-
eters  such  as  sCOD/COD and sCOD/VSS could  be used for  deter-
mining the optimum dosage [113,114] . Contrary to the conventional
coagulants, the use of some synthetic coagulants minimize the re-
quired dosage. For instance, in a recent study, PAC was dosed in a
range of 0.1 mg/L to 1.2 mg/L and the optimum dosage was found
to  be  between  0.5  and  0.8 mg/L  depending  on  polymer  addition
[13] .

Most of the studies included flocculant addition as well. It was
revealed that  combination  of  coagulant  and  polymer  (flocculant)
gave  much  better  results  compared  to  sole  coagulant  usage.  Be-
sides that, polymer usage could also reduce the coagulant dosage
[118] . The decrease in required coagulant dosage proves the syn-
ergistic effect of flocculant addition [105] . Satisfying TSS removals
are attainable by coupled usage of low dosages of a metal coag-
ulant with a cationic polymer. Therefore, extra sludge production

will be minimal and the sludge production will be in a  reason-
able range [63] . Obviously, chemical sludge production leads to a
slight  increase  in  the  sludge  management  cost.  The  increase  in
sludge  management  costs  may  be  balanced  with  the  decreasing
aeration costs in subsequent CAS process [110] . Nevertheless, there
are  some  studies  indicating  that  polymer  addition  does  not  im-
prove  removal  efficiency  [119]  or  can  even  reduce  the  efficiency
[13] . It should be pointed out that high amount of polymer addi-
tion does not enhance the removal efficiency in fact it deteriorates
the treatment efficiency [101] . This is most plausibly due to the na-
ture of polymers and it is not surprising that excessive addition of
such organic substances could increase COD of the treated wastew-
ater. He et al. [119] conducted a lab-scale study for the treatment
of a real wastewater in China and investigated three different co-
agulants (PAC, polyaluminum ferric chloride and polyferric sulfate)
solely and with a polymer (polyacrylamide). The authors concluded
that the polymer addition resulted a marginal contribution on the
overall treatment performance; however, the settling time could be
reduced by the addition of 0.5 mg/L of polyacrylamide as the poly-
mer.  Some  investigators  studied  the  usage  of  polymer  solely  in-
stead of a coagulant; however, they could not obtain a sufficient
treatment performance in these trials [117] . The different results
from the CEPT studies showed that case-specific laboratory studies
are important to find out the optimum coagulant, dosage as well
as to observe the impact of polymer addition. Some examples of
the jar test procedures for municipal wastewater found in litera-
ture are reviewed in Table 6 .

Coagulant selection and determination of the optimum dosage
are  also  very  important  in  terms  of  toxicity  in  anaerobic  diges-
tion.  PAC  was  found  to  be  more  toxic  than  FeCl
3  regarding  the
hydrolysis  step  in  anaerobic  digestion  of  CEPT  sludge.  Different
3 dosages were investigated in the study of Lin et al.
PAC and FeCl
[108] and the results showed that while the FeCl
3 addition had no
important effect on hydrolysis of CEPT sludge, as PAC dosages in-
creased hydrolysis stage was hampered. The experiments showed
that PAC had an important inhibitory effect at 24 mg Al/L [108] .
3  toxicity  was  reported  as  1.3 mL/L,
The  threshold  value  for  FeCl
which corresponded to about 1.9 g/L (specific gravity = 1.45 g/cm 3 ,
concentration = 40%  w/w),  which  was  much  higher  than  that  of
PAC  [124] .  Conversely,  Ju  et  al.  [125]  found  that  the  same  FeCl
3
dosage in CEPT could increase methane yield by 54% compared to
3 dosage increased, improvement
control reactor; however, as FeCl
in methane yield decreased gradually and it dropped to 38% for
addition of 5.0 mL/L (7.2 g/L). The result of this study propounded
that there was an optimum coagulant dosage for valorization of
CEPT sludge and beyond that, anaerobic digestion could be ham-
pered.

3.2.3. Full-scale applications

CEPT process is reported as an innovative and affordable treat-
ment  alternative  to  capture  available  carbon  present  in  wastew-
ater  and  it  is  proposed  as  an  energy  efficient  wastewater  treat-
ment  technology  [14,126] .  Implementation  convenience  and  cost
effectiveness  of  CEPT  process  make  this  technology  more  ap-
propriate  especially  for  metropolitans  [106] .  There  are  different
techniques  and  structural  alternatives  (lamella  clarifiers,  double-
decker  rectangular  settling  tanks)  in  CEPT  technology  regarding
the full-scale applications. The first CEPT plant in Hong Kong was
established with multilevel sedimentation tanks and its minimum
TSS and BOD removal efficiencies were reported as 70% and 55%,
respectively  [112] .  Average  performance  data  of  some  full-scale
CEPT plants are given in Table 7 .

The full-scale CEPT plants can be operated with low dosages of
chemicals ( Table 7 ). De Feo et al. [105] also emphasized this is-
sue and stated that the required coagulant and flocculant dosages
vary  generally  between  10–50 mg/L  and  0–1 mg/L,  respectively.
There  may  be  some  exceptions  in  typical  coagulant  dosages  for
cold climate countries. In order to meet the effluent objectives in
some Norwegian WWTPs, quite high dosages around 100 mg/L to
250 mg/L were applied [106] . In Norway, there were 28 WWTPs in
1990 s, which had only CEPT process without any further biolog-
ical treatment. With the aid of low sCOD content in wastewater,
82% and 87% of BOD and TSS removal efficiencies were achieved in
these plants, respectively [117] .

Coupling CEPT and lamella clarifiers presents the advantages of
introducing a high overflow rate and efficient coagulation. The re-
moval efficiencies are comparable with the multilevel configuration
and around 70–90% and 50–80% for TSS and BOD, respectively. In
addition to the CEPT plant in Hong Kong, there are some plants
in France and Canada using CEPT process and lamellas for primary
treatment [106,112] .

Not  only  lamella  clarifiers  but  also  ballasted  clarifiers  can  be
coupled with CEPT process. Ballasted sedimentation has been used
in water and wastewater treatment for many years. Microsand is
used in sedimentation and this creates larger flocs in the process.
Thus, high settling velocities are achievable and the removal effi-
ciency  is  enhanced.  It  was  reported  that  both  CEPT  process  and
ballasted sedimentation are capable of responding peak flows and
the  removal  efficiencies  are  comparable.  Coupling  CEPT  process
with ballasted sedimentation are widely applied in France and the
performance of the treatment plants are at the same levels given in
Table 7 [110,112] . There is another configuration that is very simi-
lar to the latter one. The only difference is the presence of a return
flow of chemically conditioned sludge to the influent. This stream
contributes to denser floc formation. It should be noted that the

The data for the facilities in Buffalo, New York, Benton Harbor, Michigan and Cleveland,

last two configurations (ballasted sedimentation and adding a re-
turn flow to the head of the sedimentation tank) are referred as
high rate clarification processes [112] .

From the economical point of view, the costs of upgrading ex-
isting plants to CEPT plants or building new CEPT plants are not
too high. This makes CEPT process affordable especially for devel-
oping countries. In Mexico City, a feasibility study was conducted
for a WWTP and different alternatives were evaluated by means
of treatment performance and economic considerations in 1995. It
was revealed that the cost of CEPT plants were 1.85 times lower
than the activated sludge plants with conventional primary treat-
ment systems [106] . Considering the treatment capacity of 15 m 3 /s
(El Salto, Mexico), annual operational cost of CEPT plant and CAS
plant with primary treatment were given as US4$ and US7$ mil-
lion, respectively which corresponded to 3.1$ and 5.4$ per m 3 of
treated wastewater, respectively [106] . The extra sludge production
can be considered as a cost increasing factor, but when all the as-
pects about treatment (i.e.; aeration requirement, sludge handling,
reactor sizes) are taken into consideration, there is a net decrease
in total cost with CEPT process [117] .

3.2.4. Additional remarks

pH  is  an  important  operational  parameter  especially  for  bio-
logical treatment. Microorganisms can sustain their metabolic ac-
tivities  in  a  certain  pH  range.  Thus,  the  CEPT  process  effluent
should also be monitored in this respect. High amount of coagulant
dosages may result in acidic pH which can damage downstream
processes. It was emphasized that pH correction may be required
to sustain nitrification process in some cases [117] . Neutral pH val-
ues should be preferred in CEPT to get maximum benefit from the
process [103] . Operation at neutral pH also does not require any pH
pre-adjustment since the original pH of raw municipal wastewater
is around neutral values.

CEPT  sludge  is  distinguished  from  the  conventional  sedimen-
tation  sludge  in  terms  of  settleability  and  dewaterability.  It  was
propounded  that  lower  than  100 mL/g  of  SVI  was  attainable  for
CEPT sludge. The characteristics of CEPT sludge were discussed by
Chu  et  al.  [127]  and  they  reported  that  CEPT  sludge  had  better
settleability and dewatering properties in comparison to raw and
digested sludge. A SVI of 68 mL/g indicated that the CEPT sludge
could settle very well. Poon and Chu [101] found that the usage
of polymers in CEPT process may increase SVI of the sludge. For
determining the dewaterability of sludge, centrifugal settleability
index (CSI) was proposed [101,127] . It is computed as given below:

CSI ( % ) = ( C O −C C ) / C O x 100

(4)

where

O = Initial sludge suspended solids concentration (mg/L)
C
C = Supernatant  suspended  solids  concentration  (mg/L)  (it  is
C
measured after applying centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 15
minutes on 50 mL of sludge sample)

Higher CSI values indicate that dewaterability of sludge is im-
proved and TSS concentration of supernatant is minimized [128] .
Particle size distribution (PSD) of the CEPT process effluent shows
different  characteristics  from  the  conventional  primary  sedimen-
tation  tank  effluents.  Mean  size  of  the  particles  in  the  effluent
significantly decreased in CEPT process in comparison to that in
conventional primary sedimentation. Zhang et al. [129] stated that
the particles having a diameter in excess of 110 μm could be com-
pletely eliminated after CEPT process.

3.3. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) process

MBR  is  a  combination  of  an  activated  sludge  process  with
a  low-pressure  membrane  (microfiltration  (UF)  or  ultrafiltration
(UF)) used for solid-liquid separation in wastewater treatment [6] .
MBRs  achieve  higher  effluent  quality  compared  to  the  CAS  pro-
cesses [130] . Less space requirement is another advantage of MBRs
over CAS plants since MBR plants do not need any settling tanks
after biological treatment [131] . The first commercial MBR was in-
troduced  in  the  late  of  1960 s  [132]  and  then,  MBR  market  has
grown  continuously  all  around  the  world.  Nowadays,  there  are
hundreds  of  full-scale  installations  (with  a  capacity  greater  than
10,0 0 0  m 3 /day)  and  it  is  anticipated  to  increase  in  the  future
[133] . There are two basic MBR configurations commonly applied
in wastewater treatment as shown in Fig. 2 . In the external config-
uration, return activated sludge (RAS) stream is recirculated out-
side  of  the  bioreactor  and  passed  through  a  membrane  unit.  A
pump is used to pressurize the sludge stream and following the
membrane separation, concentrate is sent back to the bioreactor
and  permeate  is  discharged  ( Fig.  2 a).  The  membrane  unit  is  lo-
cated in the bioreactor in the submerged configuration and a neg-
ative pressure (vacuum) is applied to force water pass through the
membrane pores ( Fig. 2 b) [134] .

MBRs produce particle and pathogen free effluents in many in-
stallations  [135] ;  however,  the  energy  demand  of  MBR  plants  is
reported  as  their  main  bottleneck.  The  energy  demand  of  MBRs
changes in a wide range (0.64–2.3 kWh/m 3 ) due to different treat-
ment capacities, effluent requirements as well as operational con-
ditions  [6] .  As  seen  from  Table  1 ,  average  energy  demand  of
WWTPs that produce water for reuse could be five or six times
higher  compared  to  that  of  CAS  plants.  MBR  effluents  can  be
reused for various purposes and the submerged MBRs are recom-
mended due to their lower energy demand and higher resistance
to fouling [134] . MBRs can be classified in terms of presence or
absence  of  oxygen  during  the  operation.  Aerobic  and  anaerobic
MBRs are able to produce effluent with similar quality; however,
aerobic  MBRs  are  typically  more  energy  intensive  systems  espe-
cially due to aeration demand [136] . Various different MBR config-
urations such as anaerobic fluidized MBRs, MBRs employing com-
pletely  autotrophic  nitrogen  removal  (CANON)  process,  fluidized
bed membrane bioelectrochemical reactors and algae-based MBRs
were also tested [137] . MBR operation under high loaded condi-
tions was also propounded to overcome the drawbacks of MBR op-

eration at long SRTs (i.e., intensive aeration, problems in membrane
scouring) [138] and increase organic matter recovery [139] .

3.3.1. High loaded MBRs

Instead  of  the  discussed  processes  in  the  previous  sections,
MBRs can also be used for carbon harvesting in wastewaters. In
this context, some MBR studies have been devoted to trap organic
matter from wastewater and to obtain energy rich sludge to re-
cover biogas in anaerobic digestion [56,57] . Membrane processes
were introduced as a promising technology to concentrate wastew-
ater [140] and they have similarities with conventional HRAS sys-
tems in terms of some operational parameters (i.e., loading rates,
SRT, DO level). Ng and Hermanowicz [56] operated CSTR and MBR
at  different  SRTs  varied  between  0.25  and  5.0  d  Results  of  the
study  indicated  that  MBR  outperformed  CSTR  at  each  operating
condition and the difference in treatment performance increased
as  SRT  decreased.  Besides,  total  COD  concentration  in  the  efflu-
ent of MBR was lower than 11 mg/L regardless of the operational
conditions.  High  OLRs  such  as  6–13 kg  COD/m 3 /day  [57]  as  well
as high F/M ratios up to 9.67 kg COD/kg MLVSS/day [56] are ap-
plicable in high loaded MBRs. Faust et al. [67] compared the COD
fractions of the concentrate stream of a high loaded MBR at short
SRTs  and  found  that  as  SRT  decreased  pCOD  fraction  increased.
The  optimum  SRT  was  found  to  be  in  the  range  of  0.5  and  1.0
d, which provided a pCOD fraction of 92–96% in the concentrate
and a limited COD mineralization between 4 and 10% of influent
COD. It was reported that only 1% of influent COD was mineral-
ized at an SRT of 0.125 day. Akanyeti et al. [141] investigated the
energy recovery in a high loaded MBR and could recover 35% of in-
fluent COD as methane. The importance of bioflocculation was also
highlighted for high loaded MBR reactors and SRT/HRT ratio, DO
level and shear were listed as the most important parameters for
optimization of bioflocculation [141] . Sözen et al. [142] developed a
high loaded MBR configuration called super fast membrane biore-
actor process (SFMBR) and could recover 54–77% of energy content
of influent at the SRTs between 0.5 and 2.0 d

In spite of some constraints of anaerobic municipal wastewa-
ter  treatment,  coupling  anaerobic  processes  with  MBR  technolo-
gies would be a promising option for recovering energy content
of wastewater. Wan et al. [14] showed that an anaerobic MBR (An-
MBR), which serves as an A-stage treatment, can remove 92% of
COD and almost 100% of solids. One of the most important find-
ings in this study is that the AnMBR effluent was rich in terms
of nutrients with nearly no pathogens, and thereby, effluent may
be reused in agricultural irrigation especially in populous countries
such as China and India.

3.3.2. Alternative filtration processes

Dynamic  MBR  technology  is  a  promising  option  for  up-
concentrating  organics  in  wastewater.  The  principle  of  dynamic
MBRs relies on a self-forming biological filtering layer on a sup-
port material [143] . Wang et al. [144] examined the organic matter

recovery by operating a dynamic MBR and could recover 80% of
influent COD. The HRT was set at 50 min in this study and the au-
thors stated that COD was mainly adsorbed onto biomass rather
than undergoing to mineralization under this condition. HiCS fol-
lowed by MBR configuration was also suggested as an alternative
to high loaded MBRs to improve organic matter harvesting. In the
lab-scale study of Dai et al. [139] , while 40.5% of influent COD was
captured in the concentrate of the high loaded MBR, it increased
to 47.5% in the HiCS plus MBR configuration operated at a SRT of
1.2 days.

Forward  osmosis  (FO)  is  another  alternative  configuration  for
up-concentration of municipal wastewater as well as excess sludge,
and high concentrated streams can be produced with an energy
efficient  way  [72] .  FO  cannot  only  treat  many  different  types  of
wastewater  but  also  produce  a  high  quality  effluent.  Distinctly
from pressure driven membrane processes, osmotic pressure dif-
ference  is  the  driver  force  in  FO  [145] .  Wang  et  al.  [140]  em-
ployed  a  pilot-scale  FO  treatment  and  achieved  to  increase  COD
content of municipal wastewater to 2335 mg/L by mixing concen-
trated wastewater and captured solids in the pre-treatment (a di-
rect membrane filtration (DMF)) stage. In the same study, it was
claimed that an energy neutral treatment could be possible when
the concentrated stream is valorized in an anaerobic downstream
process. Coupling of FO and A-stage treatment was also asserted
to enhance carbon capture. Cagnetta et al. [72] applied a volumet-
ric concentration ratio of 10 on domestic water and A-stage sludge
samples through passing a FO membrane directly. They could con-
centrate COD contents of domestic wastewater and A-stage sludge
by 8.2 and 4.8 times, respectively.

Microscreens  are  proposed  as  primary  and  tertiary  treatment
of  wastewater  and  the  working  principle  is  based  on  flowing
of wastewater through a drum which has openings with around
200 μm for primary treatment [146] . When the microscreen was
used for primary treatment, it could remove TSS with a high effi-
ciency about 80–90% as well as BOD

5 with 60–70% [147] .

DMF of wastewater was also recommended to recover organic
matter content of municipal wastewater. The idea behind DMF is
to  capture organic matter  with a porous membrane and to pre-
vent its degradation [148,149] . Membrane fouling is encountered
to a lower degree compared to MBRs due to low biomass inven-
tory of raw wastewater [150] . Chemically enhanced backwash for
DMF was suggested by Lateef et al. [148] to overcome fouling prob-
lems if necessary, which included addition of cleaning chemicals
to improve the efficiency of backwash. As an alternative to foul-
ing control, Kimura et al. [151] proposed physical cleaning by the
combination of vibrating membrane modules and mixing. Mezohe-
gyi et al. [150] applied two consecutive filtrations through a 0.4 μm
of membrane and in each step, a volumetric up-concentration ra-
tio  of  5  was  employed.  The  results  showed  that  while  the  COD
of raw wastewater was 497 mg/L, it reached up to 11,386 mg/L for
25  times  up-concentrated  wastewater.  Moreover,  the  study  gives
an insight about aerated and vibrated filtration at a fixed flux of

160

18 L/m 2 /h. It was concluded that vibrated filtration had better pro-
cess performance in terms of fouling mitigation and energy utiliza-
tion. Kimura et al. [151] attained a higher concentration factor in
DMF of municipal wastewater and could concentrate wastewater
50 times, which corresponded to 75% of organic matter capture.
When DMF is coupled with CEPT process (coagulation and floccu-
lation), the effluent quality can meet discharge criteria with a rela-
tively low energy consumption if nutrient discharge limits are not
so  stringent  [135] .  Some  innovative  technologies  like  membrane
adsorption  hybrid  system  (MAHS)  [152] ,  photo-anaerobic  mem-
brane bioreactor (PAnMBR) [153] and membrane photobioreactor
(MPBR) [154] were proposed for nutrient removal.

4. Valorization of organically rich sludge

Anaerobic digestion is the most common sludge treatment tech-
nology  that  produces  biogas  containing  methane.  The  produced
biogas can compensate 25–50% of energy consumption of a typi-
cal WWTP that employs activated sludge process [10,155] . Energy
self-sufficiency of a WWTP can vary in a wide range based on en-
ergy consumption of the applied treatment processes and energy
recovery in anaerobic digestion. The self-sufficiency can be more
than 100% like the example of Strass WWTP in Austria [19] . En-
ergy recovery potential via anaerobic digestion depends on many
parameters such as sludge characteristics of activated sludge pro-
cess, sludge pre-treatment and sludge source [156] . In the litera-
ture, there is a broad range for the biogas yield of the treatment
sludge.  The  yield  can  vary  between  300–700 L  biogas/kg  VS
added
[31] or 160–500 L CH
added for sludge [156] . The biogas yield
of waste activated sludge (WAS) is reported as lower than that of
mixed sludge (primary and WAS) due to presence of high amounts
of metabolic end products in WAS, which are resistant to biodegra-
dation [157,158] .

4 /kg VS

SRT is one of the driving factor that determines the biogas yield
of WAS.  The  accumulation  of  cellular  residues  and  inert  materi-
als should be regarded as the primary reason for the lower biogas
yields of activated sludge with long SRTs. Cellular materials can be
considered as low biodegradable or non-biodegradable under typi-
cal HRTs in anaerobic digesters [15,159] . Hydrolysis stage is gener-
ally the rate-limiting stage in anaerobic digestion, and cell walls of
bacteria and EPS have to be degraded in this stage in order to pro-
ceed with acidogenesis stage [24] . Ge et al. [15] implied that each
extra one day SRT in activated sludge process causes a 10% of de-
cline in sludge degradability. Accordingly, Bolzonella et al. [157] de-
veloped the below given empirical equation to show the relation-
ship between SRT in WWTP and biogas yield in anaerobic diges-
tion.
SGP = 0 . 23 exp ( −0 . 028SRT )

(5)

where

SGP = The specific biogas production (m 3 /kg VS)
SRT = Solid retention time in the activated sludge process (day)

Hence, the sludge degradability is strongly effected by SRT in
activated sludge process and as SRT increases, the biogas produc-
tion in anaerobic digestion decreases. The effect of SRT in an ac-
tivated sludge process on biogas and methane yield of the excess
sludge is demonstrated in Table 8 .

As  shown  in  Table  8 ,  as  SRT  increases,  biogas  and  methane
yield decreases gradually. The decrease can be more dramatic at
very long SRTs (35–45 days) [157] . It was also reported that the
valorization of A-stage sludge can provide a methane yield of 0.7
Nm 3 /kg COD
removed ) in Rotterdam-Dokhaven
WWTP  [50] .  The  results  showed  that  readily  biodegradable  COD
amount in HRAS sludge is higher than that of activated sludge with

removed (0.5 kg/kg COD

long SRTs that are more stabilized during aerobic treatment pro-
cess.

CH4 /g COD

In a WWTP, that includes both primary and secondary settling
tanks, 33% of influent COD can be recovered as methane in line
with  typical  removal  efficiencies  [14] .  Meerburg  et  al.  [54]  per-
formed a lab-scale anaerobic batch study to demonstrate energy
recovery potential of various excess sludges and found that only
inf ) could be recovered as
7% of influent COD (0.07 g COD
methane from CAS excess sludge. Wan et al. [14] compared two al-
ternative wastewater treatment configurations for COD recovery. It
was concluded that 43% and 47% of influent COD can be recovered
by CEPT and HRAS systems, respectively. The study of Kinyua et al.
[68] proved this argument experimentally and presented that 40–
55% of influent COD could be transferred to WAS of HRAS process
and valorized in anaerobic digestion. Meerburg et al. [17] also con-
ducted a detailed study and it was reported that COD recoveries
were 39% and 40% for SRTs of 0.5 and 1.3 d, respectively. For HRAS
systems, carbon redirection and harvesting should be improved to
utilize  COD  in  valorization  through  anaerobic  digestion.  As  dis-
cussed previously, considering effluent TSS in calculation of actual
SRT is quite important in HRAS systems and hence, sludge wast-
ing flowrate should be adjusted by regarding the sufficient efflu-
ent quality [62] . It should be noted that wasted sludge amount di-
rectly affects energy recovery in a WWTP. Higher energy recovery
potential of HRAS sludge can also be confirmed by higher volatile
fatty acid (VFA) production from it. Up to 420 mg COD/VSS
added of
VFA production is achievable from HRAS sludge, which is higher
than the reported VFA productions from WAS which were 298 and
368 mg  COD/VSS
added  at  mesophilic and  thermophilic  conditions,
respectively [160] .

4 /kg  VS

CEPT process provides higher organic matter diversion to anaer-
obic  digesters  [161]  and  overall  COD  diversion  to  sludge  can  be
increased  from  40%  to  60%  if  the  conventional  primary  settling
process is upgraded to CEPT process [162] . CEPT sludge can also
be used as a substrate in co-digestion with food waste and ele-
vated methane yields can be obtained in comparison with mono-
digestion of food waste [124] . Ju et al. [125] conducted a compre-
hensive study on anaerobic digestion of CEPT sludges coagulated
3  and reported VS removal effi-
with aluminum chloride and FeCl
ciency as 58% and biogas production as 920 L/kg VS
removed  (602 L
removed ).  In the  study of  Ju et  al.  [163] ,  four lab-scale
CH
semi-batch  anaerobic  digesters,  having  SRTs  of  7,  9,  12  and  16
days, were operated for CEPT sludge digestion. The methane yields
from all reactors were found to be satisfactory and maximum yield
was obtained as 0.66 L CH
4 /L/day for a SRT of 9 days. As already
noted, determination of optimum dosage is quite important to ob-
tain maximum biogas yield in anaerobic digestion. Diamantis et al.
[164] dosed iron and aluminum based coagulants in incrementally
increasing  concentrations  (0.23,  0.35,  0.70  and  1.05 mmol/L)  and
found that maximum yields were obtained at the lowest dosages
for both coagulants. Phosphate and trace elements deficiency due
to metal hydroxide formation as well as toxicity effects of coagu-
lants were responsible for the decline in biogas yield.

5. Nutrient removal

The most important constraint of HRAS and CEPT processes is
restriction of nutrient removal in subsequent processes. High COD
removal  in  these  processes  causes  insufficient  carbon  supply  for
downstream biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes
[91,126] . For instance, high carbon removal efficiencies in A-stage
limits denitrification efficiency in B-stage, thus it becomes very dif-
ficult to meet total nitrogen discharge standards [87] .

Only  a  limited  nutrient  removal  is  achievable  at  activated
sludge systems operated with short SRTs and HRTs [17] . The study
of Guven et al. [76] showed that average ammonia and TN removal

efficiencies were 15% and 21%, respectively for a pilot-scale HRAS
system.  In  the  same  study,  average  TP  removal  was  reported  as
27%.  de  Graaff et  al.  [87]  reported  total  kjeldahl  nitrogen  (TKN)
and TP removal efficiencies as 18–38% and 44–68%, respectively in
A-stages of some full-scale WWTPs in the Netherlands.

Nutrient  removal  is  also  achievable  to  some  degree  by  CEPT
systems. Nitrogen removal is not very likely due to the presence
of nitrogen mostly in soluble form in municipal wastewater, but
15–40% nitrogen removal efficiencies were reported in some stud-
ies [101,114] . In another study, only 22.6% and 7.2% removal effi-
ciencies were reported for TN and ammonium, respectively [119] .
In spite of its low performance on nitrogen removal, phosphorus
removal efficiency is higher in CEPT systems as chemical precipi-
tation is a well-known method for phosphorus removal. Complex
formation and adsorption of coagulants onto flocs or chemical pre-
cipitates are the main removal mechanisms of phosphorus [103] .
Up  to  95%  phosphorus  removal  was  attainable,  but  it  should  be
mentioned that 80% of phosphorus removal could be taken as an
average value [101,114] .

Conventional nitrification and denitrification processes require a
COD/N ratio of 9/1 to achieve nitrogen removal [165] . It should be
emphasized that A-stage solely cannot remove nitrogen sufficiently
and  further  treatment  units  should  be  implemented  in  order  to
comply with the discharge standards [82] . A typical B-stage of AB
process is designed to remove nitrogen and there are successful
full-scale  examples.  Versprille  et  al.  [55]  presented  some  opera-
tional data for nitrogen removal in B-stages of Dutch AB plants.
It was stated that BOD concentration can be below 10 mg/L in the
effluent and full denitrification can take place when F/M ratio of
A-stage and B-stage is 4 kg BOD/kg MLSS/day and 0.15 kg BOD/kg
MLSS/day, respectively. Strass WWTP is another good example that
can remove 80% of influent nitrogen and achieve a maximum am-
monia  effluent  concentration  of  5 mg/L  [38] .  It  should  be  noted
that mainstream nitrogen removal process is augmented from side
stream deamonification (also called partial nitritation and anam-
mox)  process  in  Strass  WWTP.  This  operation  method  improves
both B-stage treatment capacity and ammonia removal efficiency
[166] .  The  robustness  of  AB  process  may  be  affected  negatively
when treating low strength wastewaters. For instance, it was re-
ported that Luofang WWTP (China), that includes AB process, was
suffering from insufficient nitrogen removal in B-stage due to lack
of organic carbon for denitrification. Therefore, some operational
retrofits  were  required  to  optimize  both  nitrogen  and  phospho-
rus  removals.  The  B-stage  of  the  plant  was  shifted  to  a  modi-
fied University of Cape Town (MUCT) process to enhance nitrogen
and phosphorus removal efficiencies. Controlling COD removal effi-
ciency of the A-stage was another operational strategy, which pro-
vides sufficient amount of organic carbon and keeps COD/N ratio
at a desirable level for the B-stage [77] .

Several BNR processes can be applied for phosphorus removal
from wastewater. Anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A 2 /O) process is the most
common  one  among  them,  that  includes  anaerobic,  anoxic  and

oxic  basins  sequentially.  In  spite  of  the  successful  A 2 /O  process
configurations, biological phosphorus removal is not an easy pro-
cess  to  maintain  due  to  difficulties  ensuring  optimal  conditions
for  polyphosphate  accumulating  organisms  (PAOs)  and  presence
of nitrate in RAS stream to anaerobic basin [167] . Chemical pre-
cipitation was introduced  to  overcome  the  limitations in biolog-
ical  phosphorus  removal;  however,  overdosing  of  chemicals  can
lead to extra removal of organic carbon and it can damage bio-
logical nitrogen removal in wastewaters with low C/N ratio [168] .
The full-scale biological phosphorus removal in HRAS process has
not been well investigated so far. The WWTPs employing AB pro-
cess  generally  apply  chemical  precipitation  for  phosphorus  re-
moval [89] . Ferrous sulfate, ferric chloride and ferric chloride sul-
fate can be added to either A-stage or final treatment unit before
discharge [87,92] .

5.1. Up-to-date processes

The effort s f or developing efficient nitrogen removal configura-
tions for carbon poor effluents have been mainly based on inno-
vative processes that require low COD/N ratios. Non-conventional
nitrogen removal processes such as nitritation/anammox and nitri-
taiton/denitritation require quite low COD/N ratios such as 3/1 and
7/1, respectively [165] . In this respect, the suggested processes are
promising for nitrogen removal from the effluents of the processes
used for carbon capturing. Lower oxygen demand and less sludge
production in comparison to conventional nitrification and denitri-
fication processes are other superiorities of the innovative nitro-
gen removal processes [166] . Nitritation is also called partial ni-
trification. Distinctly from nitrification, ammonium is partially ox-
idized in nitritation and is mainly converted to nitrite instead of
nitrate  by  ammonium  oxidizing  bacteria.  Subsequently,  nitrite  is
converted to nitrogen gas, which is referred as denitritation pro-
cess [169] . Nitritation process can also take place partially, which
means a certain amount of ammonia remain while some nitrite is
produced at the end. Partial nitritation is the preceding stage of
coupled nitritation/anammox processes. Anaerobic ammonium ox-
idizing bacteria use non-oxidized ammonium and nitrite to pro-
duce  nitrogen  gas  in  anammox  process  [166] .  From  the  micro-
biology  point  of  view,  the  main  requirement  for  anammox  pro-
cess is suppression of the nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and het-
erotrophic denitrifying bacteria. It is reported that for the wastew-
aters having C/N ratio greater than two, heterotrophic denitrifying
bacteria can outcompete anammox bacteria. In order to outcom-
pete NOB, some operational parameters such as pH, DO concentra-
tion, aeration regime can be adjusted in such a way that anammox
bacteria favor [14,75] . Nevertheless, eliminating NOB is practically
not applicable since adjusting the parameters given above are not
attainable  generally  for  mainstreams  [170] .  Process  vulnerability
to  the  temperature  is  another  important  challenge  in  anammox.
Anammox can take place in warm temperatures (20–30  °C) and
high nitrogen removal efficiencies were reported in these tempera-

162

tures. Strass WWTP in Austria and Changi WWTP in Singapore are
two examples, which carry out mainstream nitritation and anam-
mox. The reported removal efficiencies are low for cold anammox
and the process is almost interrupted at temperatures below 15 °C
[166] .

Many mainstream deammonification processes were proposed
for the removal of nitrogen from carbon poor effluents in the re-
gions  where  nutrient  discharge  standards  are  strict  [166] .  Fig.  3
shows a typical mainstream deammonification process for carbon
poor effluents. pH shocks, influent solids concentration and mixing
problems can be given as examples for the main operational prob-
lems for deammonification [171] . In addition to those, anammox
bacteria are slow growing microorganisms and influent ammonium
concentration  and  temperature  can  limit  their  growth  [166,172] .
Typical influent ammonium concentration of municipal wastewa-
ter and winter temperatures do not favor the growth of anammox
bacteria  [172] .  Cold  anammox  (at  10–20  °C)  can  suffer  to  meet
stringent nitrogen discharge limits due to process infirmity [166] .
Lotti et al. [173] demonstrated a pilot-scale mainstream anammox
experiment for an A-stage effluent (Dokhaven WWTP, the Nether-
lands)  and  stated  that  only  up  to  46%  of  nitrogen  removal  was
achievable.  The  authors  reported  that  the  average  ambient  tem-
perature is below 19  °C during 6–7 months throughout a year at
Dokhaven WWTP, which shows the impact of temperature on the
process. Hereby, several carbon capture and nitrogen removal pro-
cesses with their combinations are provided in Fig. 4 .

Processes relying on granular sludge can also be employed for
nutrient  removal  as  well  as  carbon  removal  simultaneously.  The
granular  sludge  processes  have  advantages  over  floc-based  ones
with  respect  to  low  footprint  and  superior  SVI  [174] .  Granular
sludge  reactors  can  also  be  used  in  mainstream  deammonifica-
tion  and  high  nitrogen  removal  efficiencies  can  be  achieved  at
warm temperatures. Similar to mainstream deammonification, con-
cerns about operation at low temperatures are also valid for gran-
ular  anammox  reactors  [166] .  Wang  et  al.  [175]  proposed  a  si-
multaneous nitrification, denitrification and phosphorous removal
(SNDPR)  process  in  a  SBR  reactor  for  low  C/N  ( ≤3.5)  wastewa-
ters. They achieved 78% TN removal and the phosphorus concen-
tration in the effluent was only 0.2 mg/L. Additionally, it was stated
that the SNDPR process can be performed in either granular, hy-
brid or biofilm systems. Biological phosphorus removal was not the
scope of the first AB plants and the phosphorus has been gener-
ally eliminated from wastewater by means of chemical precipita-
tion. Short SRT in HRAS process has been regarded as an important
drawback  to  provide  optimum  growth  conditions  for  PAOs  [89] .
Mulkerrins et al. [176] reviewed SRTs of some WWTPs employing
biological  phosphorus  removal  and  apart  from  some  exceptional
cases, SRTs were around 10 days. These SRTs can enhance biolog-
ical phosphorus removal; however, long SRTs promote the growth
of glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) that can outcompete
PAOs and deteriorate phosphorus removal process [177] . There are
various  groups  of  PAOs,  which  were  characterized  with  distinct

metabolic processes. Ge et al. [178] conducted a study about bio-
logical phosphorus removal at short SRTs and found out a specific
group of PAOs that can remove phosphorus at the SRTs of about
2–4 days. Several studies were conducted for phosphorus removal
at  short  SRTs  and  the  studies  showed  that  phosphorus  removal
was achievable at the SRTs of around 3–4 days with specific PAOs
group [89,179] . The contributions of the researchers indicate that
enrichment of specific PAOs and augmentation of them in biolog-
ical phosphorus removal are the key elements for biological phos-
phorus removal from wastewater at short SRTs.

6. Future perspectives

In Fig. 5 , a process layout example, dedicated to maximum en-
ergy  and  material  recovery,  is  provided  for  municipal  wastewa-
ter treatment. In order to capture the carbon content of wastew-
ater  as  much  as  possible,  an  A-stage  treatment  is  proposed
in  the  process  layout.  The  A-stage  treatment  has  been  suc-
cessfully  implemented  in  some  Austrian  WWTPs  such  as  Strass
WWTP  (220,0 0 0  PE)  and  Wolfgangsee-Ischl  WWTP  (50,0 0 0  PE).
Intensive control on aeration, improved digestion process, energy
efficient  CHP  units  and  deammonification  of  reject  water  of  de-
watering  equipment  are  the  main  elements  to  increase  energy
efficiency  in  both  WWTPs.  The  average  electricity  produced  in
anaerobic digestion are 21.4 kWh/PE/year and 20.6 kWh/PE/year in
Strass WWTP and Wolfgangsee-Ischl WWTP, respectively [6] . Coag-
ulant addition to primary clarifiers contributes extra carbon diver-
sion to sludge stream and thus, enhancing biogas yield in anaer-
obic digestion [3] . Chemical phosphorus removal from A-stage re-
actor effluents can also be achieved to some extent with chemi-
cal addition to primary clarifiers [87] . Organic fraction of munic-
ipal solid waste (OFMSW) is introduced to the sewer system to-
gether with municipal wastewater after a physical pre-treatment
stage (removal of inorganic material and maceration of organics)
[180] . Co-digestion of A-stage sludge and different organic wastes
is another option to increase methane yield of anaerobic digestion.
It was reported that kitchen waste and molasses can be used in
co-digestion process in order to increase methane yield of A-stage
sludge [181] .

Aerobic  granular  sludge  reactor,  one  of  the  most  recently
developed  wastewater  treatment  technology,  was  proposed  for
the  removal  of  nitrogen  and  residual  COD  in  A-stage  effluent.
Aerobic granules consist of different layers and each layer has a
different task. While aerobic processes take place in outer layers,
anoxic  and  anaerobic  processes  are  carried  out  in  inner  layers.
High  settling  velocities  of  granules  ensure  outstanding  settling
properties and the settling is nearly completed in 5 min [174] . In
a typical WWTP operation, supernatant of the sludge dewatering
is recirculated to the head of the WWTP; however, COD/N ratio in
conventional nitrification and denitrification processes can be im-
balanced due to high nitrogen content of digester effluents [182] .
In the proposed layout, magnesium ammonium phosphate (stru-

vite) precipitation was propounded for not only providing a stable
mainstream  nitrogen  removal  but  also  recovery  of  phosphorous
rich fertilizer [183] . Shu et al. [184] reported that 1 kg of struvite
can be recovered from 100 m 3 of wastewater having a phosphorus
concentration  of  4 mg/L.  This  value  shows  that  struvite  recovery
from  digester  supernatant  has  a  huge  potential  since  phospho-
rus  concentration  of  supernatant  is  in  the  order  of  100 mg/L
[185] .  Deammonification  (one-stage  partial  nitritation  and
anammox/DEMON)  can  be  applied  on  struvite  precipitation
process  effluents  and  it  can  reduce  total  energy  demand  of  a
WWTP  by  about  50%%  which  employs  conventional  mainstream
nitrification and denitrification [186] .

Limited freshwater resources necessitate water reuse and mu-
nicipal wastewater is a reliable source after some reclamation pro-
cesses.  Reclaimed  water  can  be  used  for  non-potable  purposes
(i.e., municipal irrigation, industrial uses, road cleaning) [42] and
potable  purposes  (i.e.,  groundwater  recharge,  direct  injection  to

water network) [187] . The study of Pollice et al. [188] showed that
advanced filtration can produce reclaimed water from secondary
effluents to be used in agriculture. This study reported that both
physicochemical and microbiological criteria in agricultural reuse
could be met by employing advanced filtration. Combination of re-
verse osmosis (RO) and disinfection should be carried out follow-
ing secondary treatment, if effluent is used in potable reuse [6] .
The  reclaimed  water  can  be  either  recharged  to  groundwater  or
directly injected to a water distribution system [187] . The thermal
energy in effluents of WWTPs can be recovered by heat pumps for
the internal use on-site (i.e., digester heating) [6] or can be dis-
tributed to the residential areas for heating, cooling and hot wa-
ter supply [189] . Hepbasli et al. [190] expressed that 700 MWh of
energy  can  be  produced  by  a  temperature  difference  of  1  °C  in
60 0,0 0 0 m 3 of wastewater. If there is a sufficient elevation differ-
ence between discharge point and receiving water body, hydraulic
energy recovery can also be possible. The effluent flow rate and the

164

head pressure are the main parameters determining energy recov-
ery potential [191] . A WWTP in Vienna (Austria) treating 560,0 0 0
m 3 /day of wastewater has a drop of 5 m and can met 2.6% of its
electricity demand from hydraulic energy recovery [10] .

Bioplastic  production  from  secondary  wastewater  sludge  is
an  eco-friendly  option  in  sustainable  wastewater  management.
Polyhydroxyalkanoates  (PHAs)  are  one  of  the  natural  bioplastics
that  accumulate  inside  the  cell  structure  of  bacteria.  PHAs  are
biodegradable materials and have similar mechanical properties as
well as thermal properties with those in synthetic plastics [192] .
Several methods can be performed in PHA extraction such as sol-
vent extraction method, enzymatic digestion, mechanical cell dis-
ruption  and  the  use  of  supercritical  carbon  dioxide  [193] .  Simi-
lar to primary sludge digestion, secondary sludge can also be val-
orized in anaerobic digestion as an alternative to bioplastic pro-
duction, although biodegradability of secondary sludges is not as
high as primary and HRAS sludges. Bertanza et al. [3] suggested
thermal hydrolysis for the pre-treatment of excess sludge to im-
prove sludge degradability and biogas production and it can be ap-
plied on B-stage excess sludge. Bougrier et al. [194] reviewed ther-
mal pre-treatment processes in the literature and concluded that
biogas/methane production can increase between 20 and 100%. It
was  reported  that  the  process  is  generally  conducted  at  around
170  °C for 30–60 min. As a common practice, the produced biogas
is converted to heat and electricity through CHP plants, whereas
some  countries  like  Sweden,  Germany  and  Switzerland  produce
important amounts of vehicle fuel from biogas [195] . Energy con-
tent  of  the  upgraded  biogas  is  same  as  that  of  pure  methane
(9.7 kWh/Nm 3 ) and 1 liter of diesel fuel with an energy content
of 9.87 kWh can be replaced by 1 m 3 of upgraded biogas [196] .

7. Conclusions

WWTPs  have  begun  to  serve  as  energy  and  resource  recov-
ery facilities to extract  energy content of wastewater and to re-
cover valuable compounds such as carbon, nitrogen and phospho-
rus present in wastewater in various forms. Several attempts have
been done within this concept in the last decades, but more ad-
vanced processes should be developed or the existing ones should
be retrofitted in order to valorize the constituents in wastewater
as much as possible.

Up-concentration  of  organic  matter  present  in  the  municipal
wastewater is as an important issue to approach energy neutrality
in wastewater treatment. As described in Table 1 , typical energy
demand of a CAS system is 0.33–0.60 kWh/m 3 and it corresponds
to around one fifth of held chemical energy in municipal wastew-
ater. It is possible to recover a significant portion of organics from
municipal wastewater and hence, to improve energy efficiency by
applying appropriate techniques. HRAS and CEPT systems are the
most common practices applied for this purpose and there exists
valuable operational experience about them. The main objective of
HRAS process is to minimize COD oxidation, but to promote COD
capture on sludge. The recent studies have showed that it is also
possible to operate MBRs under high loading conditions as well as
to use other membrane processes in order to obtain sludge rich
with organic matter. Biogas potential of organically rich sludge is a
few times higher than that of CAS sludge and more energy through
anaerobic digestion can be recovered from A-stage sludge. On the
other side, there are still some gaps about nutrient removal from
carbon  poor  effluents.  Suggested  configurations  to  overcome  the
limitations  about  removing  nutrients  from  carbon  poor  effluents
(having a COD/N ratio smaller than 9/1) are still developing and
there  is  a  lack  of  full-scale  experience  for  those  configurations.
Especially  mainstream  deammonification  process  is  a  promising
technology  to  remove  nitrogen,  but  still  some  improvements
should be done especially for low operational temperatures.

A  detailed  process  flow-diagram  is  depicted  in  Fig.  5 ,  which
aims  to  maximize  material  and  energy  recovery  in  wastewater
treatment. Some valuable products such as sludge cake and stru-
vite to be used on soil as well as reclaimed water to be used in
irrigation can be produced. Strategies to improve energy efficiency
can offset energy demand of WWTPs by 100% and make them en-
ergy neutral. When other good management practices (i.e., inten-
sive process control, choice of energy efficient equipment and use
of some renewable energy sources on-site such as hydropower if
there is a geometric head for effluent discharge) are also realized,
it can be possible to approach energy neutrality or even energy
surplus in municipal wastewater treatment systems.
