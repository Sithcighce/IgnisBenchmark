At lower temperatures, alkyl radicals (R) react with O2 to form alkylperoxy radicals (ROO), which propagate through QOOH intermediates to produce chain-branching OH radicals via reactions like ROO → QOOH → OOQOOH → 2OH + products. However, as temperature increases within the NTC regime, the ROO ⇌ R + O2 equilibrium shifts backward, reducing QOOH formation. Concurrently, QOOH decomposition to less reactive HO2 radicals via pathways like QOOH → olefin + HO2 becomes dominant over second O2 addition. This shift from chain-branching to chain-terminating pathways creates the NTC effect, where higher temperatures suppress overall reactivity. The phenomenon is particularly pronounced in hydrocarbon fuels with multiple CH2 groups (e.g., n-heptane) due to their complex low-temperature oxidation mechanisms.", "original_text": {"1": "The highly nonlinear and complex phenomena that take place inside an ICE, has made it difficult to predict, control, and optimize them using either conventional physics-based or data-driven approaches.

The pressure rise rate (PRR) directly influences RI through the squared term (∂P/∂t)^2_max, which scales with the square of the local heat release rate during end-gas autoignition. The proportionality constant (a/2πf) accounts for acoustic energy dissipation, where f ≈ (nπa)/L (n=1,2,...) depends on combustion chamber dimensions L. For typical engines, f ≈ 5-15kHz.

(2) Kolmogorov-scale eddies (η ≈ (ν^3/ε)^1/4) create fine-scale Φ fluctuations that alter local ignition delay times τ_ign ∝ exp(E_a/RT)·[Fuel]^a[O2]^b. (3) Turbulence-chemistry interaction via Damköhler number (Da = τ_turb/τ_chem) determines whether combustion occurs in flamelet (Da>>1), distributed reaction (Da≈1), or well-mixed (Da<<1) regimes. For CFD modeling, transported PDF methods coupled with detailed chemical mechanisms (e.g., 54-species PRF mechanism) outperform flamelet-based approaches because they directly resolve Φ-PDF-TPDF correlations.
