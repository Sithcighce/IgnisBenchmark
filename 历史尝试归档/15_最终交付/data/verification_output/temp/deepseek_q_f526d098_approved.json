  "question_text": "How do the different chemical forms of alkali metals in biomass and coal (water-soluble, NH4Ac-soluble, HCl-soluble, insoluble) affect their release behavior during thermochemical conversion, and what general patterns are observed regarding which forms contribute most to gas-phase release?",
  "standard_answer": "The release behavior of alkali metals during thermochemical conversion is strongly influenced by their initial chemical forms in the fuel. Water-soluble alkali metals, present as ions held by water inside biomass and coal pore structure as water-soluble salts, are highly mobile and readily released. NH4Ac-soluble compounds, which are present as exchangeable ions organically bound with carboxyl groups, also contribute significantly to release. In contrast, HCl-soluble compounds (coordinated metal ions organically bonded with nitrogen- or oxygen-containing functional groups) and insoluble compounds (present as silicate minerals) show much lower release tendencies. The general pattern observed is that with increasing combustion temperature, the release ability of alkali metals is enhanced, but this enhancement primarily comes from water-soluble and NH4Ac-soluble alkali metals, while HCl-soluble and insoluble alkali metals are almost not released. These patterns are established through sequential extraction procedures that categorize alkali metals into these four solubility fractions, providing insight into their relative mobility and release potential during thermal conversion processes.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Generally, the alkali species in biomass and coal can be divided into two types, i.e., organic compounds and inorganic compounds. Further determination of their forms in biomass and coal can be investigated using sequential extraction procedures with water, ammonium acetate solution and hydrochloric acid solution, respectively.",
    "2": "It is generally believed that with increasing combustion temperature, the release ability of alkali metals will be enhanced, among which, the release of alkali metals mainly comes from water-soluble and NH4Ac-soluble alkali metals, while the HCl-soluble and insoluble alkali metals are almost not released."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and provides correct elaboration on the chemical forms of alkali metals. It correctly identifies the four categories (water-soluble, NH4Ac-soluble, HCl-soluble, and insoluble), accurately describes their chemical nature and bonding characteristics, and correctly states the release pattern that water-soluble and NH4Ac-soluble forms are primarily released while HCl-soluble and insoluble forms are almost not released. The answer also correctly notes that release ability increases with temperature. The additional details about the specific chemical bonding (e.g., ions held by water, exchangeable ions with carboxyl groups, coordinated metal ions with N/O functional groups, silicate minerals) are consistent with standard combustion science understanding of sequential extraction procedures. No factual errors or logical contradictions are present.",
