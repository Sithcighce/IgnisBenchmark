  "question_text": "How does the turbulent Weber number quantitatively characterize droplet deformation and breakup in spray atomization processes, and what specific relationships were identified between droplet aspect ratio and turbulent Weber number?",
  "standard_answer": "The turbulent Weber number provides a quantitative framework for characterizing droplet deformation in spray atomization by relating turbulent kinetic energy to surface tension forces. Kourmatzis and Masri defined the turbulent Weber number as We' = ρg(u')²d/σ, where ρg is gas density, u' is RMS velocity fluctuation, d is droplet diameter, and σ is surface tension coefficient. This dimensionless parameter captures the competition between turbulent disruptive forces and cohesive surface tension effects. Experimental studies revealed a linear relationship between droplet aspect ratio and turbulent Weber number, where higher We' values correspond to more deformed, non-spherical droplets. Additionally, turbulent fluctuations were found to delay the evolution from deformed to more spherical droplet shapes by continuously introducing velocity gradients across droplet surfaces. The turbulent Weber number thus serves as a key predictive parameter for droplet morphology evolution in turbulent spray environments.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately represents all key information from the original text. It correctly states: (1) the turbulent Weber number definition as We' = ρg(u')²d/σ with proper identification of all variables, (2) the linear relationship between droplet aspect ratio and turbulent Weber number, and (3) that turbulent fluctuations delay the evolution from deformed to more spherical droplets. The answer provides appropriate context and explanation of the physical mechanisms (competition between turbulent disruptive forces and surface tension) which is consistent with the fundamental physics of the Weber number. All factual statements align with the original text, and the logical flow is sound.",
