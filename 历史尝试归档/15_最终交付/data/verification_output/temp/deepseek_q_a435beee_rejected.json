  "question_text": "What are the key differences between the boundary condition scheme and source term scheme for handling conjugate heat transfer in unsteady pore-scale simulations, and under what conditions does each scheme maintain second-order accuracy?",
  "standard_answer": "The boundary condition scheme treats phase interfaces as explicit boundaries between different domains, implementing the continuity conditions (Tf = Ts and -λf∂Tf/∂nf = λs∂Ts/∂ns) through specialized LB boundary operations. This scheme maintains second-order accuracy when the interface is located at the midpoint between lattice nodes, as it uses interpolation schemes that preserve the geometric interface position. The source term scheme reformulates the energy equation to match the form recoverable from standard LB models by introducing source terms at interface nodes. This approach avoids explicit boundary treatment but achieves only first-order accuracy when interfaces are not at midpoints because it doesn't account for the exact interface location. The boundary condition scheme's accuracy depends on proper geometric representation and interpolation, making it superior for curved interfaces and moving boundaries. The source term scheme is computationally simpler but less accurate for complex geometries. For unsteady heat transfer with significant (ρCp) differences between phases, the boundary condition scheme is preferred as it directly enforces the physical interface conditions, while the source term scheme may introduce numerical diffusion at interfaces. The choice depends on the interface geometry, property contrasts, and required accuracy for transient thermal analysis in porous media.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "These schemes generally can be divided into two categories: the boundary condition scheme and the source term scheme.",
    "2": "The test results indicate that when the material interface is not located at the midpoint, the boundary condition scheme is of second order accuracy, while the source term scheme is at best of first-order accuracy because such scheme does not consider the exact location of the interface."
