  "question_text": "How do differential diffusion effects (e.g., non-unity Lewis numbers) influence flame propagation in stratified mixtures, and what are the implications for modeling turbulent stratified combustion?",
  "standard_answer": "Differential diffusion effects, arising from non-unity Lewis numbers (Le ≠ 1), significantly influence flame propagation in stratified mixtures by altering local flame structure, speed, and stability. Key mechanisms include: (1) Preferential diffusion of light species (e.g., H₂, H) compared to heat can lead to local enrichment or depletion of reactants in the flame zone. For example, in a lean stratified flame, if Le_fuel < 1, fuel diffuses faster than heat, causing local equivalence ratio increases that enhance flame speed and may prevent extinction. Conversely, if Le_oxidizer > 1, oxygen diffusion lags, potentially leading to local quenching. (2) These effects are amplified in mixture gradients, where differential diffusion can cause thermo-diffusive instabilities, manifesting as cellular flame structures or altered flame curvature. (3) In turbulent stratified flames, the interaction between differential diffusion and turbulence scales modifies flame wrinkling and burning rates. For instance, small-scale turbulence can amplify differential diffusion effects by enhancing scalar gradients. Modeling implications are profound: standard presumed PDF methods that assume equal diffusivities (Le=1) fail to capture these phenomena. Advanced approaches like flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) or transported PDF methods must incorporate differential diffusion by solving additional transport equations for key species or using tabulated chemistry with Le corrections. This is crucial for predicting pollutant formation (e.g., NOx, soot) and flame stability in practical devices like DI SI engines or gas turbines, where mixture stratification is common.",

Key points verified: (1) Non-unity Lewis numbers alter flame structure, speed, and stability - matches original text exactly. (2) The mechanism of preferential diffusion (light species like H₂, H diffusing faster than heat) is physically sound. (3) Examples given (Le_fuel < 1 causing local enrichment, Le_oxidizer > 1 causing oxygen lag) are correct applications of differential diffusion principles. (4) Thermo-diffusive instabilities and cellular structures are well-established phenomena. (5) The interaction between differential diffusion and turbulence modifying flame wrinkling and burning rates directly matches the original text. (6) Modeling implications are logically sound - presumed PDF methods assuming Le=1 would indeed fail to capture these effects, and advanced methods like FGM and transported PDF with differential diffusion corrections are appropriate solutions. (7) Applications to practical devices (DI SI engines, gas turbines) and pollutant formation are relevant extensions. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions.",
