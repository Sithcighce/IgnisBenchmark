  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how the global energy balance concept for smouldering systems differs from traditional local energy analyses, and describe how this global perspective enables prediction of smouldering fate before global heat exchange effects impact the reaction.",
  "standard_answer": "The global energy balance concept for smouldering systems fundamentally differs from traditional local energy analyses by considering the cumulative integration of energy processes across the entire fuel bed over time, rather than focusing solely on instantaneous local phenomena. Traditional local analyses emphasize processes occurring within thin reaction fronts, such as reaction rates, mass transfer, and local heat exchange. In contrast, the global perspective recognizes that smouldering behavior at the system scale depends on the integral, in space and time, of many key processes. This approach is particularly important for applied smouldering where predicting reaction fate ahead of time allows operators to modify conditions to maintain self-sustained propagation. The global energy balance enables prediction before global heat exchange impacts the reaction because it accounts for the continual feedback between heat and mass transfer processes and chemical kinetics that determines smouldering fate. This cumulative approach considers that the evolution of a smouldering front, while a local process, is determined by a global energy balance that integrates processes across the entire system, allowing operators to anticipate whether conditions will lead to increasing temperatures, self-sustaining propagation, or decaying propagation leading to extinction.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately captures and elaborates on the key concepts from the original text. It correctly distinguishes between local and global energy analyses, explaining that the global perspective considers 'cumulative integration of energy processes across the entire fuel bed over time' which aligns with the original text's statement that the global energy balance is 'cumulative in time and has to be integrated in space.' The answer correctly explains the practical importance for applied smouldering, matching the original text's point about predicting reaction fate to allow operators to modify conditions. The answer appropriately elaborates on how this global perspective enables prediction before global heat exchange impacts the reaction through continual feedback between processes. All physical principles are correctly stated, there are no contradictions with the original text, and the logical flow is sound. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors.",
