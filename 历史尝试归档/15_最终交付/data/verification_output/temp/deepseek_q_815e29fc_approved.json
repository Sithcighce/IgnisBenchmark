  "question_text": "Calculate the theoretical Faradaic efficiency (FE) for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis if the current density for EAS is 0.5 mA cm⁻² and the total current density is 2.0 mA cm⁻², and explain how competing HER affects this efficiency.",
  "standard_answer": "Faradaic efficiency (FE) is calculated as FE = (I_EAS / I_total) × 100%, where I_EAS is the current used for EAS and I_total is the total current. Here, I_EAS = 0.5 mA cm⁻² and I_total = 2.0 mA cm⁻², so FE = (0.5 / 2.0) × 100% = 25%. Competing HER reduces FE because it consumes electrons and protons that could otherwise be used for N2 reduction. HER is a 2-electron process kinetically favored over the 6-electron EAS process, especially on metals with strong H-binding energies. For instance, on pure transition metals, HER often dominates due to lower activation barriers, leading to FEs below 10%. Strategies to suppress HER include using catalysts with weak H adsorption (e.g., early transition metal nitrides) or engineering surfaces to repel H⁺ (e.g., positively charged single-atom catalysts), thereby increasing the proportion of current directed toward EAS.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly calculates FE as 25% using the proper formula. It accurately explains that HER is a competing reaction that reduces FE by consuming electrons and protons, which is consistent with the original text stating HER is 'much more kinetically favorable than EAS' and is 'the main competing reaction to EAS, especially on the surface of pure transition metal'. The answer correctly identifies HER as a 2-electron process versus the 6-electron EAS process, explains the kinetic favorability on metals with strong H-binding, and provides valid strategies to suppress HER. All physical principles, cause-effect relationships, and mechanisms are scientifically sound and align with the original text.",
