  "question_text": "How do pyrolysis temperature and residence time affect gas composition and aromatic formation in polyolefin pyrolysis, and what general relationships can be established from the available evidence?",
  "standard_answer": "The available evidence indicates that pyrolysis temperature and residence time significantly influence both gas composition and aromatic formation in polyolefin pyrolysis, though the specific mechanisms remain limited by the provided citations. Regarding gas composition, increasing pyrolysis temperature enhances hydrogen concentration in the gas product, while having no effect on the formation of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. This suggests that higher thermal energy promotes hydrogen evolution through dehydrogenation pathways without altering CO/CO2 production. For aromatic formation, longer residence time is favorable for the evolution of aromatics, indicating that extended reaction times allow for secondary reactions that transform primary pyrolysis products into aromatic compounds. The relationship between temperature and aromatic formation is less clearly established from the citations, though the general trend shows that both higher temperatures and longer residence times promote cracking reactions that can lead to more complex hydrocarbon transformations. These findings highlight the importance of carefully controlling both temperature and residence time to achieve desired product distributions in polyolefin pyrolysis processes.",

    "1": "It was also found that the increase of pyrolysis temperature enhanced the concentration of H2 in the gas product, however, there was no effect on the formation of CO or CO2",
    "2": "longer residence time is favorable for the evolution of aromatics"
