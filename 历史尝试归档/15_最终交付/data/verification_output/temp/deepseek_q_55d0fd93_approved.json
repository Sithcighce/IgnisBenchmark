  "question_text": "What are the key physicochemical properties of tyre pyrolysis oil that limit its direct use in automotive compression-ignition engines, and how do these properties affect combustion and emissions?",
  "standard_answer": "TPO's high viscosity (typically 3-6 mm²/s at 40°C, but can exceed standards), elevated sulfur content (often 1000-1500 ppm), and high polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations are primary limitations. High viscosity impairs atomization in fuel injectors, leading to larger droplet sizes, poorer air-fuel mixing, and incomplete combustion—increasing particulate matter (PM) and unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions. Sulfur compounds poison aftertreatment catalysts (e.g., diesel oxidation catalysts and SCR systems), reducing NOx conversion efficiency and increasing sulfate PM. PAHs contribute directly to soot formation through nucleation and surface growth mechanisms during combustion, exacerbating PM emissions. Additionally, TPO's lower cetane number (CN) compared to diesel prolongs ignition delay, elevating premixed combustion phases and peak temperatures, which can increase NOx formation via the Zeldovich mechanism. These properties collectively challenge compliance with EN 590 and emission regulations like Euro VI.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Generally, a well-known fact is that crude TPO complies with neither EN 590 nor ASTM D-2 as a standalone, drop-in fuel because of its high viscosity and large amounts of impurities [17].",
    "2": "Sulphur is limited in automotive diesel fuel because it is a catalyst poison for diesel oxidation catalysts, catalysts for NOX reduction by urea SCR, and NOX adsorbed catalysts."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately addresses the key physicochemical properties limiting TPO use in compression-ignition engines. It correctly identifies high viscosity, elevated sulfur content, and high PAH concentrations as primary limitations, consistent with the original text's mention of 'high viscosity and large amounts of impurities' and non-compliance with EN 590/ASTM D-2. The explanation of sulfur poisoning aftertreatment catalysts (DOC, SCR, NOx adsorbers) directly matches the original text. The mechanistic explanations are scientifically sound: viscosity affecting atomization and combustion quality, PAHs contributing to soot formation, lower cetane number increasing ignition delay and NOx via Zeldovich mechanism are all correct combustion science principles. While the answer is detailed and goes beyond the minimal information in the original text excerpts, all additional technical details (specific viscosity ranges, sulfur content values, combustion mechanisms) are factually accurate and represent legitimate elaborations consistent with combustion science fundamentals. No contradictions or errors detected.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground truth: crude TPO does not meet EN 590/ASTM due to high viscosity/impurities, and sulfur poisons aftertreatment catalysts. The extended mechanisms—poor atomization from high viscosity increasing PM/UHC, sulfur increasing sulfate PM and degrading DOC/SCR performance, PAHs promoting soot formation, and lower cetane increasing ignition delay and NOx via Zeldovich—are scientifically sound and consistent with combustion principles. Minor quantitative ranges may vary, but do not contradict the core conclusions.",
