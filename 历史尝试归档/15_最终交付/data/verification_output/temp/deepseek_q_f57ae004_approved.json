  "question_text": "What are the key mechanisms by which carbonate formation degrades AAEMFC performance, and how do solid alkaline anion exchange membranes mitigate these issues compared to liquid electrolytes?",
  "standard_answer": "Carbonate formation in AAEMFCs degrades performance through two primary mechanisms: (1) reduction of hydroxide ion concentration due to the side reaction between OH⁻ and CO₂, forming carbonate ions (CO₃²⁻), which decreases ionic conductivity and reaction rates; (2) precipitation of metal carbonates that block pores in porous electrodes, impeding mass transport of reactants and products. Solid alkaline anion exchange membranes (AAEMs) mitigate these issues by replacing liquid electrolytes, thus eliminating the bulk liquid phase where carbonate precipitation occurs. AAEMs provide a fixed-phase pathway for OH⁻ transport, reducing CO₂ solubility and carbonate formation kinetics. Additionally, the solid membrane structure minimizes electrode flooding and drying problems associated with liquid electrolyte management. However, AAEMs are not entirely immune to CO₂, as surface reactions can still occur, but their impact is significantly reduced due to the absence of free liquid electrolyte and improved membrane chemical stability.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "One significant factor preventing widespread commercialization is the use of the alkaline liquid electrolyte, which may cause two problems. One is the carbonate, the product of the side reaction between hydroxide ions in the liquid electrolyte and carbon dioxide in the air, reducing the concentration of hydroxide ions and potentially blocking the pores of the porous electrode via the precipitation of the metal carbonate",
    "2": "The use of solid electrolyte membranes in fuel cells can remove the carbonate problem and avoid the liquid electrolyte management"

The answer correctly states that solid AAEMs mitigate these issues by eliminating the bulk liquid phase where carbonate precipitation occurs.
