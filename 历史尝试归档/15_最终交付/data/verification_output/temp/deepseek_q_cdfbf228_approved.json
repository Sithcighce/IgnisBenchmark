  "question_text": "How does the 'back-supported combustion' phenomenon in stratified flames enhance local burning rates compared to homogeneous premixed flames, and what are the key physical mechanisms driving this effect?",
  "standard_answer": "Back-supported combustion in stratified flames occurs when a flame propagates from a region of higher equivalence ratio into a leaner mixture, leading to enhanced local burning rates due to heat and radical diffusion from the richer combustion products. The key mechanisms include: (1) Preheating of the unburned lean mixture by thermal conduction from the hotter products of the richer combustion, which increases the local temperature and reduces ignition delay. (2) Diffusion of reactive radicals (e.g., H, O, OH) from the richer flame zone into the lean region, accelerating chain-branching reactions. (3) The local flame speed is modulated by the mixture gradient, with the flame experiencing a 'push' from the higher reactivity zone behind it. This results in a higher displacement speed than in a homogeneous lean flame. The effect is particularly pronounced when the mixture gradient is aligned with the flame normal, allowing efficient transport of enthalpy and species. In turbulent stratified flames, this can lead to significant local variations in heat release rate and flame structure, complicating modeling approaches that assume uniform mixture composition.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes back-supported combustion in stratified flames and is fully consistent with the original text. It correctly identifies the core phenomenon (flame propagating from rich to lean regions with enhanced burning rates due to heat and radical diffusion) as stated in the original text. The answer provides detailed mechanisms including: (1) preheating via thermal conduction, (2) radical diffusion accelerating reactions, and (3) modulation of flame speed by mixture gradients - all of which are consistent with the 'push' from higher reactivity zones mentioned in the original text. The explanation of displacement speed being higher than homogeneous lean flames directly matches the original text. Additional details about mixture gradient alignment, turbulent effects, and modeling complications represent reasonable elaborations that are physically sound and do not contradict the source material. All physical principles (thermal conduction, radical transport, chain-branching reactions) are correctly stated.",
