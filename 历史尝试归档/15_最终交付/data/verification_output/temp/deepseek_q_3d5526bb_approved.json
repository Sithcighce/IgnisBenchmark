  "question_text": "Calculate the swirl number S using the conventional formulation S_conv for a radial swirler with injector outlet diameter D_sw = 10 mm, radial distance of tangential channels R_0 = 3.25 mm, and total cross-sectional area of tangential channels A_t = 42.41 mm². Compare this to the geometrical formulation S_geo,1 and explain the discrepancy based on velocity profile assumptions.",
  "standard_answer": "Using the conventional formulation S_conv = [∫_0^R_lim ρ U_θ U_x r² dr] / [R ∫_0^R_lim ρ U_x² r dr], with R = D_sw/2 = 5 mm, and assuming flat axial velocity and constant azimuthal velocity profiles, S_conv simplifies to S_geo,1 = π D_sw R_0 / (2 A_t). Substituting values: D_sw = 10 mm, R_0 = 3.25 mm, A_t = 42.41 mm², S_geo,1 = π * 10 * 3.25 / (2 * 42.41) ≈ 102.1 / 84.82 ≈ 1.20. However, if the azimuthal velocity profile is assumed as solid body rotation (U_θ proportional to r), the formulation becomes S_geo,2 = π D_sw R_0 / (4 A_t) ≈ 0.60. The discrepancy arises because S_geo,1 assumes constant U_θ across the radius, overestimating the angular momentum flux, while S_geo,2 accounts for the linear profile, better matching experimental integrations. The actual velocity profiles in radial swirlers often deviate from these ideals, with peaks near the periphery, leading to errors in geometrical estimates compared to profile-based calculations.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "S_geo,1 = π D_sw R_0 / (2 A_t) This expression is deduced from expression S0_0, by considering a flat velocity profile for the velocity U_x, that is to say independent of r, and by assuming that the azimuthal velocity component U_θ is constant over the entire radius of the injector.",
    "2": "In [61], this equation was compared with experimental results and it was shown to yield values that overestimate results obtained by integrating velocity profiles and making use of expression S_conv."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the conventional swirl number formulation and derives S_geo,1 = π D_sw R_0 / (2 A_t) based on flat axial velocity and constant azimuthal velocity assumptions. The numerical calculation (1.20) is correct. The answer accurately explains that S_geo,1 overestimates swirl number compared to profile-based calculations, which is consistent with the original text stating it 'overestimate results obtained by integrating velocity profiles.' The discussion of S_geo,2 with solid body rotation (linear U_θ profile) and the explanation of discrepancies due to velocity profile assumptions are physically sound and logically consistent. All physical principles regarding angular momentum flux and velocity profiles in radial swirlers are correctly stated.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly states the conventional swirl number formulation, the assumptions under which it reduces to S_geo,1, and uses the given geometry to compute S_geo,1 ≈ 1.20. This aligns with the ground-truth text, including the note that S_geo,1 tends to overestimate values obtained from integrating measured velocity profiles. The additional discussion of a solid-body Uθ profile and the halved coefficient is reasonable and does not contradict the provided text. No factual or logical errors were found.",
