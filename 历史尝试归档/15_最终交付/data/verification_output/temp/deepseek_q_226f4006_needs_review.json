  "question_text": "Calculate the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for biodiesel (C19H36O2) and petrodiesel (approximated as C12H26) using combustion chemistry principles. Then, based on the provided research findings, explain the emission performance differences between biodiesel and petrodiesel, focusing specifically on which emissions are reduced and which are increased.",
  "standard_answer": "The stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (AFR) is calculated from complete combustion equations. For biodiesel C19H36O2: C19H36O2 + 26.5O2 → 19CO2 + 18H2O. Molecular weight = (19×12) + (36×1) + (2×16) = 228 + 36 + 32 = 296 g/mol. Oxygen required = 26.5 moles × 32 g/mol = 848 g. Using standard combustion engineering with 23.2% oxygen by mass in air, air required = 848/0.232 = 3655 g. Stoichiometric AFR = 3655/296 ≈ 12.35. For petrodiesel C12H26: C12H26 + 18.5O2 → 12CO2 + 13H2O. Molecular weight = (12×12) + (26×1) = 144 + 26 = 170 g/mol. Oxygen required = 18.5 × 32 = 592 g. Air required = 592/0.232 = 2552 g. Stoichiometric AFR = 2552/170 ≈ 15.01. Biodiesel's lower AFR results from its oxygen content, which reduces the external air requirement. According to the research findings, 'Biodiesel outperforms petrodiesel in terms of most regulated emissions exhausted (i.e., carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC), particulate matter (PM), and smoke) except the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx).' This indicates biodiesel reduces CO, UHC, PM, and smoke emissions but increases NOx emissions compared to petrodiesel. The inherent oxygen in biodiesel promotes more complete combustion, leading to reduced incomplete combustion products, though the specific mechanisms for NOx increase are not detailed in the provided citations.",

The combustion equations are balanced correctly, molecular weights are calculated accurately, and the oxygen mass fraction in air (23.2%) is appropriately applied. The emission performance comparison accurately reflects the original text, stating that biodiesel reduces CO, UHC, PM, and smoke emissions but increases NOx emissions compared to petrodiesel. The explanation linking biodiesel's inherent oxygen content to more complete combustion is chemically sound. All factual statements are correct and consistent with the original text.",
