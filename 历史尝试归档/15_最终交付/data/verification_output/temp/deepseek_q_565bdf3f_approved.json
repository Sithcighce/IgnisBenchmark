  "question_text": "Using the Semenov thermal explosion theory framework, explain how the sequential exothermic reactions during thermal runaway in a LiCoO2/graphite cell create a positive feedback loop that overwhelms the system's heat dissipation capacity. Specifically address the temperature-dependent reaction sequence and how each stage contributes to progressive temperature escalation.",
  "standard_answer": "According to Semenov thermal explosion theory, thermal runaway occurs when heat generation exceeds heat dissipation, creating a positive feedback loop. In LiCoO2/graphite cells, this begins with SEI layer decomposition at relatively low temperatures: 'The SEI layer may decompose at relatively lower temperature of 69°C.' This initial exothermic reaction raises the cell temperature, accelerating subsequent reactions through Arrhenius kinetics. As temperature increases further, 'As temperature increases, the battery undergoes the following chemical transformations: the SEI layer decomposition, reaction between the anode material and electrolyte, reaction between the cathode material and electrolyte, electrolyte decomposition, and the reaction between the anode and the binder.' The decomposition of the SEI layer exposes the lithiated graphite anode, allowing direct reaction with electrolyte solvents. This anode-electrolyte reaction generates additional heat, further elevating temperature. The progressive nature of these reactions creates a cascading effect where each exothermic stage provides the thermal energy needed to initiate the next, more energetic reaction. The heat generation from these sequential and parallel reactions follows exponential temperature dependence, while heat dissipation to the environment increases only linearly with temperature. Once the critical temperature (T_NR) is reached where heat generation curves become tangent to heat loss lines in Semenov plots, the system enters thermal runaway as the positive feedback loop becomes self-sustaining, overwhelming the cell's limited heat dissipation capacity through natural convection and conduction pathways.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies Semenov thermal explosion theory to LiCoO2/graphite cell thermal runaway. It accurately quotes the SEI decomposition temperature (69°C) and the sequential reaction stages from the original text. The explanation of positive feedback loops, Arrhenius kinetics, exponential heat generation vs. linear heat dissipation, and the critical temperature (T_NR) concept are all consistent with established combustion theory and thermophysics. The cascading nature of exothermic reactions and the mechanism by which heat generation overwhelms dissipation capacity are correctly described.

It explains how each exothermic stage elevates temperature to trigger subsequent reactions, creating a positive feedback loop that surpasses the cell’s heat dissipation capacity.
