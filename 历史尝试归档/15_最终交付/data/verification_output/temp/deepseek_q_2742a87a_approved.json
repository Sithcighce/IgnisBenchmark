  "question_text": "How do reactor configurations like downers, spouted fluidized beds, and vortex reactors influence light olefin selectivity during polyolefin pyrolysis, based on their heat and mass transfer characteristics?",
  "standard_answer": "Reactor configurations significantly impact light olefin selectivity in polyolefin pyrolysis through their heat and mass transfer properties. Downers, spouted fluidized beds, and vortex reactors are specifically designed to achieve short residence times (<1 second), which is crucial for minimizing secondary reactions that convert valuable light olefins to undesirable by-products like methane, aromatics, and coke. These reactor types provide enhanced heat transfer that enables rapid heating of polymer particles, reducing temperature gradients that can cause non-uniform cracking. The improved mass transfer in these reactors facilitates quick removal of pyrolysis vapors from the reaction zone, preventing bimolecular reactions that would otherwise lead to aromatic formation and coke deposition. The paper emphasizes that designing reactors with minimum temperature gradients and nearly isothermal temperature profiles can significantly prevent undesirable by-products. These advanced reactor configurations are envisaged to result in optimal yields of C2–C4 olefins by better controlling the reaction environment and suppressing secondary reactions that reduce light olefin selectivity.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and demonstrates sound understanding of combustion science principles. It correctly identifies that downers, spouted fluidized beds, and vortex reactors are designed to achieve short residence times (<1 second) to minimize secondary reactions, which aligns with the original text's statement that these reactors are 'envisaged to result in optimal yields of C2–C4 olefins.' The answer appropriately explains the mechanisms: enhanced heat transfer for rapid heating, improved mass transfer for quick vapor removal, and the importance of minimizing temperature gradients to achieve nearly isothermal profiles. These explanations are consistent with fundamental principles of reactor design and pyrolysis chemistry. The causal relationships (short residence time → reduced secondary reactions → higher light olefin selectivity) are logically sound. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all additional explanations (e.g., prevention of bimolecular reactions, aromatic formation, coke deposition) are scientifically accurate and represent reasonable elaboration of the core principles stated in the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the original text by attributing improved light olefin selectivity to reactor designs that minimize temperature gradients and approach isothermal operation, and by indicating that downers, spouted fluidized beds, and vortex reactors are envisaged to optimize C2–C4 yields. The elaborations on rapid heating, enhanced heat/mass transfer, quick vapor removal, and suppression of secondary reactions are physically sound and consistent with established pyrolysis principles. The only minor issue is the specific numerical residence time claim, which is not in the provided text.",
