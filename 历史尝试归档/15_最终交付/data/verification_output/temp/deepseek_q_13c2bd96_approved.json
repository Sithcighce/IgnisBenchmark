  "question_text": "Using the provided paper content, derive the steady-state mixture fraction field solution for a non-premixed jet flame with step inflow boundary conditions, neglecting axial diffusion (Model Problem A). Explain the physical significance of the Peclet number (Pe = U₀R_f/D) in this context and how it appears in the solution. Then, describe how this steady solution is used to determine the flame position and discuss the implications for flame structure.",
  "standard_answer": "The steady-state mixture fraction field solution for Model Problem A (neglecting axial diffusion, b=0) is derived from the Z-equation with step inflow boundary conditions. The solution is given by: Z₀ = R_f/R_w + Σ[2/(nπ)sin(A_n)cos(A_ny/R_f)exp(-A_n²x/PeR_f)] where A_n = nπ(R_f/R_w) are the eigenvalues. The Peclet number Pe = U₀R_f/D physically corresponds to the relative time scales for convective and diffusive processes to transport mass over a distance R_f. In the solution, Pe appears in the exponential decay term exp(-A_n²x/PeR_f), showing that transverse modes decay more rapidly with axial distance at lower Pe values where diffusion dominates, leading to broader mixture fraction profiles. The flame position is determined by solving the implicit equation Z₀(x,y=ξ₀(x)) = Z_st, where Z_st is the stoichiometric mixture fraction. This means the flame sheet lies along the contour where the mixture fraction equals its stoichiometric value. The steady solution shows that mixture fraction gradients are sharpest near the burner exit and decay downstream, with the decay rate controlled by Pe. Higher Pe values (convection-dominated) maintain sharper gradients further downstream, while lower Pe values (diffusion-dominated) lead to more rapid smoothing of concentration gradients, affecting flame length and shape.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reproduces the steady-state mixture fraction solution and Peclet number definition from the original text. The physical interpretation of Pe as representing the ratio of convective to diffusive time scales is correct and matches the original text. The explanation of how Pe appears in the exponential decay term exp(-A_n²x/PeR_f) is accurate, and the discussion of how Pe affects the decay rate of transverse modes is physically sound. The description of flame position determination via Z₀(x,y=ξ₀(x)) = Z_st is correct for non-premixed flames. The implications regarding mixture fraction gradients, their decay with axial distance, and the effect of Pe on flame structure (higher Pe maintaining sharper gradients, lower Pe leading to broader profiles) are all logically consistent with the governing equations and physical principles. While the answer is more detailed than the original text excerpts, all additional explanations are accurate extensions of the core concepts.",
