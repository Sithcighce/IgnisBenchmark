  "question_text": "How do temperature gradients in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) lead to material degradation through thermal stresses, and what are the specific degradation mechanisms mentioned in the literature?",
  "standard_answer": "Temperature gradients in SOFCs create thermal stresses due to differential thermal expansion between adjacent materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion. These thermal stresses can exceed the mechanical strength of the ceramic components, leading to material degradation. When the temperature in SOFCs exceeds critical values, it causes electrode sintering where the pore structures collapse, reducing reactive sites and diminishing triple-phase boundaries essential for electrochemical reactions. Simultaneously, unwanted chemical reactions occur between electrodes and electrolytes, forming insulating phases that reduce ionic conductivity. The thermal stresses produced by temperature gradients combined with sintering effects lead to thermal cracking and delamination at material interfaces. Delamination occurs when interfacial stresses exceed the bonding strength between functional layers, separating them and increasing ionic transport resistance. These degradation mechanisms collectively reduce SOFC performance and lifetime by compromising structural integrity and electrochemical activity.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the degradation mechanisms in SOFCs caused by temperature gradients. It correctly identifies: (1) thermal stresses from differential thermal expansion, (2) electrode sintering with pore structure collapse when temperature exceeds critical values, (3) unwanted chemical reactions between electrodes and electrolytes forming insulating phases, (4) thermal cracking and delamination from combined thermal stresses and sintering effects, and (5) delamination occurring when interfacial stresses exceed bonding strength. All statements are consistent with the original text and represent sound physical principles. The answer provides appropriate elaboration (e.g., explaining differential thermal expansion, triple-phase boundaries, ionic conductivity reduction) that is factually correct and enhances understanding without contradicting the source material. The causal relationships are logically sound throughout.",
