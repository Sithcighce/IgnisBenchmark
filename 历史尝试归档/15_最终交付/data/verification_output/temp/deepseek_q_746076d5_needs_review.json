  "question_text": "Calculate the axial location of the first interference maximum in a non-premixed flame subjected to bulk axial forcing at frequency f, given U₀ = 2 m/s, R_f = 0.01 m, and explain the physical mechanism behind this interference pattern.",
  "standard_answer": "For a non-premixed flame with bulk axial forcing, the flame position fluctuation is given by ξ₁,ₙ(x,t) ∝ [1 - exp(i2πStx/R_f)] where St = fR_f/U₀ is the Strouhal number. The interference pattern arises from the term 1 - exp(i2πStx/R_f) = 2sin(πStx/R_f)exp[i(πStx/R_f - π/2)]. The first maximum occurs when |sin(πStx/R_f)| = 1, which requires πStx/R_f = π/2, giving x_max = R_f/(2St). Substituting St = fR_f/U₀, we get x_max = U₀/(2f). For U₀ = 2 m/s and R_f = 0.01 m, the first maximum occurs at x_max = 2/(2f) = 1/f meters. Physically, this interference pattern results from the superposition of two effects: wrinkles generated at the flame base (x=0) due to flame attachment, and disturbances excited locally throughout the flame length. The term '1' represents the spatially uniform response from the boundary condition, while exp(i2πStx/R_f) represents wrinkles convecting downstream at speed U₀. When these two components are in phase (constructive interference), maxima occur; when out of phase (destructive interference), nodes form. The first maximum at x = U₀/(2f) corresponds to a phase difference of π radians between the boundary-generated and locally-excited disturbances, where the convective time delay x/U₀ equals half the forcing period 1/(2f).",

The original text directly uses 1 - e^(i2πfx/U₀) without invoking St = fR_f/U₀. Although mathematically the approaches are equivalent and lead to the same answer, the standard answer's formulation with ξ₁,ₙ(x,t) ∝ [1 - exp(i2πStx/R_f)] is not how the original text presents it. The original text uses the direct form 1 - e^(i2πfx/U₀). This represents a deviation in presentation approach, though not a fundamental error in the final physics or result. Given the instruction to check consistency with the original text, this deviation in formulation approach, while arriving at correct conclusions, represents an inconsistency with how the original text frames the problem.",
