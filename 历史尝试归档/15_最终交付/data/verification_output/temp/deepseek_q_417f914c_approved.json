  "question_text": "Using the principles of heat transfer and fluid mechanics, explain how temperature affects Li-ion cell capacity through changes in ion mobility and solid-state diffusion, and describe how these mechanisms influence internal impedance and overpotential during discharge.",
  "standard_answer": "Temperature significantly impacts Li-ion cell capacity through fundamental heat transfer and fluid mechanics principles. Higher temperatures improve ion mobility in the electrolyte due to reduced viscosity, which enhances transport properties and facilitates ion movement through the cell. Simultaneously, solid-state diffusion coefficients increase with temperature, allowing more efficient lithium ion movement within electrode materials. These combined effects reduce the cell's internal impedance and overpotential during discharge. The reduced overpotential means the cell can discharge more capacity before reaching the lower voltage cutoff limit, effectively increasing accessible capacity. Conversely, at lower temperatures, the electrolyte becomes more viscous, significantly reducing ion transport properties and setting a lower limit on performance. The temperature-dependent changes in ion mobility and diffusion directly affect the internal resistance components, creating larger overpotentials that cause premature voltage cutoff during discharge, thereby reducing the measured capacity under identical discharge conditions.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Higher temperatures cause both ion mobility and solid-state diffusion to improve, thus reducing a cell's internal impedance and overpotential. This means that a cell can discharge more capacity before the lower voltage limit is reached",
    "2": "At lower temperatures, the electrolyte is more viscous and ion transport properties are reduced, setting a lower limit on performance and consequently a lower capacity"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the temperature effects on Li-ion cell capacity and is fully consistent with the original text. It correctly describes: (1) higher temperatures improving ion mobility through reduced electrolyte viscosity, (2) increased solid-state diffusion coefficients at higher temperatures, (3) the resulting reduction in internal impedance and overpotential, (4) how reduced overpotential allows more capacity discharge before voltage cutoff, and (5) the reverse effects at lower temperatures with increased viscosity and reduced ion transport. The answer appropriately connects these mechanisms to heat transfer and fluid mechanics principles as requested. While more detailed than the original text, all additional explanations (e.g., mentioning transport properties, internal resistance components) are scientifically accurate and enhance understanding without introducing errors. The cause-effect relationships are logically sound throughout.",
