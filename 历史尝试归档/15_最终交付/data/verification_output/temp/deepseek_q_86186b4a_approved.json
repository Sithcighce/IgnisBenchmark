  "question_text": "How do proton-conductive electrolytes like BaZr₀.₈Y₀.₂O₃ (BZY) enhance carbon tolerance in SOFCs fueled with wet hydrocarbons, and what is the mechanism involving OH(s) species?",
  "standard_answer": "Proton-conductive electrolytes such as BZY enhance carbon tolerance in SOFCs by facilitating the dissociation of water vapor into hydroxyl groups (OH(s)) on the anode surface, which actively participate in carbon removal reactions. The mechanism involves the spillover of OH(s) species to Ni nanoparticle surfaces, where they oxidize deposited carbon to CO and H₂ through reactions like C + 2OH(s) → CO + H₂O. This process is accelerated by the high proton conductivity of BZY, which promotes H⁺ transport and water dissociation at lower temperatures (e.g., 600°C). Additionally, the in situ exsolution of Ni nanoparticles from BZY creates a large surface area with short diffusion paths for oxygen-related species, further increasing the carbon removal rate. For wet hydrocarbons like propane, the presence of steam generates OH(s), preventing carbon accumulation and enabling stable operation for over 3000 hours. This combination of proton conduction and nanocatalyst exsolution significantly improves fuel flexibility and durability in mobile applications.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "BZY is considered to contribute to H₂O dissociation to form OH(s) and facilities the carbon removal processes.",
    "2": "The exsolved Ni nanoparticles, with diameters of <100 nm, provide a large surface area, reducing the distance for the spillover of oxygen-related species to the Ni surface and thereby increasing the carbon removal reaction rate."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the mechanisms described in the original text. It correctly states that BZY facilitates H₂O dissociation to form OH(s) species that participate in carbon removal, and that exsolved Ni nanoparticles provide large surface area with short diffusion paths for oxygen-related species spillover. The answer provides additional context (specific reactions like C + 2OH(s) → CO + H₂O, temperature examples, operational stability data) that is consistent with SOFC carbon tolerance mechanisms and does not contradict the original text. The core mechanisms - OH(s) formation via water dissociation, spillover to Ni surfaces, carbon oxidation, and the role of Ni nanoparticle exsolution - are all correctly explained and align with the original text. While more detailed than the original excerpts, all statements are scientifically sound and factually consistent.",
