  "question_text": "Calculate the total energy stored in a latent heat storage system using a PCM with a melting point of 300°C, specific heat of 1.5 kJ/kg·K (solid) and 2.0 kJ/kg·K (liquid), latent heat of fusion of 250 kJ/kg, for a temperature cycle from 250°C to 350°C. Compare this to a sensible heat storage system using the same material without phase change over the same temperature range.",
  "standard_answer": "For the latent heat storage system, the total energy stored (Q_LHS) is calculated using the equation: Q = m [C_ps (T_m - T_L) + ΔH_m + C_pl (T_H - T_m)], where m is mass (assume 1 kg for comparison), C_ps = 1.5 kJ/kg·K, C_pl = 2.0 kJ/kg·K, T_m = 300°C, T_L = 250°C, T_H = 350°C, and ΔH_m = 250 kJ/kg. Thus, Q_LHS = 1 × [1.5 × (300 - 250) + 250 + 2.0 × (350 - 300)] = 1 × [75 + 250 + 100] = 425 kJ. For the sensible heat storage system without phase change, the energy stored (Q_SHS) is Q = m × C_p_avg × (T_H - T_L), where C_p_avg is the average specific heat over the range. Using an approximate average of 1.75 kJ/kg·K (mean of solid and liquid values), Q_SHS = 1 × 1.75 × (350 - 250) = 175 kJ. The latent heat storage stores 425 kJ/kg, which is 2.43 times more than sensible storage (175 kJ/kg), demonstrating the advantage of PCMs in compact energy storage due to the latent heat contribution.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Latent heat storage (LHS) makes use of the heat absorbed or released by the storage material when it experiences a phase change between solid and liquid or liquid and gas. The storage capacity of a LHS system with phase change materials is given by: Q = m [∫ C_ps dT from T_L to T_m + ΔH_m + ∫ C_pl dT from T_m to T_H]",
    "2": "Sensible heat storage (SHS) stores thermal energy by raising the temperature of a solid or liquid without the occurrence of a phase change. The following equation expresses the SHS potential: Q = m ∫ C_p dT from T_L to T_H when C_p ~ constant"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the latent heat storage equation from the original text. For LHS: Q_LHS = m[C_ps(T_m - T_L) + ΔH_m + C_pl(T_H - T_m)] = 1×[1.5×50 + 250 + 2.0×50] = 425 kJ is mathematically correct. For SHS, using an average specific heat of 1.75 kJ/kg·K (mean of 1.5 and 2.0) to calculate Q_SHS = 1×1.75×100 = 175 kJ is a reasonable approximation for the sensible heat storage case. The comparison showing LHS stores 2.43 times more energy (425/175) is accurate and demonstrates the advantage of PCMs. All calculations are correct, the physical principles are properly applied, and the conclusion is logically sound and consistent with the original text.",

The SHS comparison excludes latent heat and integrates Cp over the same range; using either segment-wise integration [1.5*(300−250) + 2.0*(350−300)] or the average Cp (1.75) over a 100 K span yields 175 kJ/kg. Arithmetic and units are consistent, and the result aligns with the PECS expressions. The ratio (≈2.43) is correct.",

The calculation for latent heat storage (LHS) correctly sums the sensible heat of the solid phase, the latent heat of fusion, and the sensible heat of the liquid phase. The calculation for sensible heat storage (SHS) uses a reasonable average specific heat for comparison, which is a valid approach for this type of problem. All numerical calculations are accurate, and the final conclusion is logically derived from the results and consistent with established thermophysical principles.",
