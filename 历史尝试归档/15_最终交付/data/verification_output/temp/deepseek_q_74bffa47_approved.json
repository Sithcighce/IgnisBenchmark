  "standard_answer": "The efficiency of GHG removal in an SCPP-photocatalysis hybrid system is governed by mass transfer and fluid dynamics principles that enable continuous contact between atmospheric GHGs and photocatalyst surfaces. The SCPP creates a controlled airflow through the stack effect, where 'the chimney at the center of the SCPP induces the air to flow from the collector inlet and also increases the flow velocity due to the stack effect: the higher the chimney, the faster the fluid flows.' This induced airflow provides the necessary transport mechanism to bring non-CO₂ GHGs into contact with photocatalyst-coated surfaces. The mass transfer process is critically limited by 'the principal method limitation is the transport of the pollutants towards the active surfaces,' which determines how effectively GHGs can reach the photocatalytic sites. The large-scale deployment of these systems enables significant atmospheric processing, as 'worldwide installation of 50,000 SCPPs, each of capacity 200 MW' would result in processing '1 atmospheric volume each 14-16 years,' demonstrating how the combination of fluid flow dynamics and mass transfer principles enables atmospheric cleansing of non-CO₂ GHGs through continuous air processing over extensive photocatalyst surfaces.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains how mass transfer and fluid dynamics govern GHG removal efficiency in SCPP-photocatalysis systems. All three key mechanisms are correctly presented: (1) the stack effect creating controlled airflow through the chimney, with accurate quotation about flow velocity increase; (2) mass transfer limitation being the transport of pollutants to active surfaces, correctly quoted; (3) the atmospheric processing capacity with accurate citation of 50,000 SCPPs at 200 MW processing 1 atmospheric volume every 14-16 years. The answer correctly identifies the causal relationships (chimney height → flow velocity, airflow → GHG transport to catalyst surfaces, large-scale deployment → atmospheric processing). The physical principles are sound: stack effect driving buoyancy-induced flow, mass transfer limitations in heterogeneous catalysis, and the scaling of atmospheric processing with deployment. No factual errors, logical contradictions, or inconsistencies with the original text were found.",
