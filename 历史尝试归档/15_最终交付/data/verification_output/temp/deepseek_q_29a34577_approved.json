  "question_text": "How do contaminants like phosphine and chlorine chemically interact with nickel-based electrodes in SOCs, and what are the resulting degradation mechanisms that lead to irreversible performance loss?",
  "standard_answer": "Phosphine (PH3) and chlorine contaminants interact with nickel-based electrodes in solid oxide cells through distinct chemical pathways that cause irreversible degradation. Phosphine exposure results in the formation of new phases, mainly nickel phosphides, but also nickel phosphates, which is identified as an irreversible change and negatively affects the overall performance. These nickel phosphide phases permanently deactivate catalytic sites and alter electrode morphology. For chlorine contaminants, the degradation occurs in two stages: the first stage is identified as reversible adsorption and blocking of the nickel catalyst surface, while the second stage is observed to be irreversible degradation and formation of nickel chloride compounds on the surface. The formation of nickel chloride compounds represents an irreversible morphological change that damages the fuel electrode structure. Both contaminants lead to performance deterioration through chemical interactions that modify the electrode composition and microstructure, with phosphine forming stable nickel phosphide phases and chlorine progressing from reversible adsorption to irreversible nickel chloride formation.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the chemical interactions and degradation mechanisms of phosphine and chlorine contaminants with nickel-based electrodes in SOCs. For phosphine, it correctly states the formation of nickel phosphides and phosphates as irreversible changes that deactivate catalytic sites and alter morphology, consistent with the original text. For chlorine, it accurately describes the two-stage degradation process: reversible adsorption/blocking in the first stage and irreversible nickel chloride formation in the second stage, matching the original text exactly. The answer correctly identifies the irreversible nature of both degradation pathways and their effects on electrode structure and performance. All factual statements align with the original text, and the physical/chemical principles are correctly stated.",
