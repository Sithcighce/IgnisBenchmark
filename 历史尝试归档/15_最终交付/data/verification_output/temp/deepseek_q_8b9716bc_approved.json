  "question_text": "Why do biofuels and electrofuels require blending with conventional kerosene despite their cleaner combustion characteristics, and what specific physical property necessitates this limitation?",
  "standard_answer": "Biofuels and electrofuels typically exhibit lower aromatic content compared to conventional kerosene, which creates compatibility issues with existing aircraft engine seals. Elastomeric seals in jet engines are designed to swell and maintain proper sealing when exposed to aromatic compounds present in traditional kerosene. When exposed to low-aromatic alternative fuels, these seals can shrink due to the lack of aromatic-induced swelling, potentially leading to fuel leaks and safety hazards. The ASTM D7566 standard specifically mandates a minimum aromatics content of 8% by volume to prevent this issue. While alternative fuels offer cleaner combustion with reduced soot, particulate matter, and sulfur emissions due to their paraffinic nature, the material compatibility requirement forces blending with conventional kerosene to maintain the necessary aromatic content for proper seal function. This represents a fundamental trade-off between combustion performance and material engineering constraints in aviation systems.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "On the other hand, a low aromatic content has the disadvantage to cause shrinkage of some elastomers in the engine seal",
    "2": "Reflecting this risk, ASTM D7566 requires a minimum aromatics content of 8% by volume, and as a result alternative fuels have been used as blends with conventional kerosene"

The answer provides additional context about seal swelling mechanisms, combustion benefits of alternative fuels, and the trade-off between performance and material compatibility - all of which are scientifically sound elaborations that don't contradict the original text. The physical principles regarding aromatic-elastomer interactions and seal function are correct. No factual errors or logical contradictions detected.",
