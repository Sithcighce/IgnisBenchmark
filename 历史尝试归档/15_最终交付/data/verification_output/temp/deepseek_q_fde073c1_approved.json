  "question_text": "How does the critical viscosity model predict particle adhesion in gas turbines, and what are the physical mechanisms behind the relationship between particle viscosity and sticking probability?",
  "standard_answer": "The critical viscosity model predicts particle adhesion by comparing the particle's dynamic viscosity at impact temperature to a critical viscosity threshold, typically set at the particle's softening temperature. When particle viscosity (μ) is below or equal to the critical viscosity (μc), the sticking probability is unity, indicating certain adhesion. For viscosities above μc, the probability decreases inversely with viscosity according to P_visc = μc/μ. Physically, this relationship arises because lower viscosity enables greater particle deformation upon impact, increasing the contact area with the substrate and enhancing energy dissipation through viscous forces. The kinetic energy of the particle is absorbed by viscous deformation work and surface energy interactions, reducing the energy available for rebound. Additionally, lower viscosity facilitates the flow of molten or softened phases at the particle-substrate interface, promoting adhesion through capillary forces and improved wettability. The model's reliance on viscosity reflects the transition from solid-like (high viscosity, elastic rebound) to liquid-like (low viscosity, plastic deformation and sticking) behavior as particles heat up in the turbine environment.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The sticking probability was assumed to be inversely proportional to viscosity. In terms of sticking probability, viscosity at or below the critical viscosity is assumed to have a sticking probability of unity whereas at other particle temperature, according to the relation P_visc = μc / μ",
    "2": "This model is implemented assuming that the critical viscosity value corresponds to the particle viscosity at the softening temperature (μ_soft). Softening temperature is a predetermined temperature value, and it is a function of the particle material that could be calculated/measured according to the standard ASTM – D1857-04"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the critical viscosity model as described in the original text. It correctly states that: (1) sticking probability is unity when μ ≤ μc, (2) sticking probability follows P_visc = μc/μ for higher viscosities, and (3) the critical viscosity corresponds to the softening temperature. The answer provides additional physical mechanisms (particle deformation, contact area increase, energy dissipation, capillary forces, wettability) that explain WHY viscosity affects sticking - these are scientifically sound elaborations consistent with the model's physical basis. The transition from elastic rebound (high viscosity) to plastic deformation (low viscosity) is a correct interpretation of the viscosity-dependent behavior. While the original text is more concise and focuses on the mathematical relationship, the standard answer's expanded physical explanations are accurate and do not contradict the source material.",
