  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, what are the observed effects of SO₂ and NO on homogeneous mercury oxidation by chlorine in coal combustion flue gas, and what specific experimental evidence supports these effects?",
  "standard_answer": "According to the paper content, SO₂ inhibits Hg⁰ oxidation with the presence of HCl in the gas mixture. The paper specifically states that 'an SO₂ concentration of 500 ppmv decreases the percentage of Hg²⁺ from 27% to 20% at an HCl concentration of 200 ppmv.' This demonstrates a clear inhibitory effect where SO₂ reduces mercury oxidation efficiency. For NO, the paper indicates that 'NO significantly decreased mercury oxidation with the addition of chlorine (Cl = 500 ppmv).' These experimental observations show that both SO₂ and NO act as inhibitors to mercury oxidation by chlorine species in homogeneous reactions. The effects are concentration-dependent, as shown by the specific ppmv values provided. The paper does not provide detailed chemical mechanisms for these inhibitory effects, but presents the experimental evidence of reduced Hg²⁺ formation when these gases are present alongside chlorine compounds in the flue gas environment.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the original text content. It correctly states that SO₂ inhibits Hg⁰ oxidation and provides the exact experimental evidence (500 ppmv SO₂ decreases Hg²⁺ from 27% to 20% at 200 ppmv HCl). It also correctly reports that NO significantly decreased mercury oxidation with chlorine addition (Cl = 500 ppmv). The answer appropriately notes that both gases act as inhibitors, that effects are concentration-dependent, and acknowledges that detailed chemical mechanisms are not provided in the paper. All factual statements align with the original text, and the logical presentation is sound. The answer is somewhat detailed but contains no errors.",
