  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, what specific limitations and performance degradation factors affect optical regression rate measurement methods (such as laser beam reflection and video photography) at elevated pressures, and how do these factors impact measurement accuracy and resolution?",
  "standard_answer": "According to the review paper, optical regression rate measurement methods face several specific limitations at elevated pressures that degrade their performance. The laser beam reflection method exhibits reduced resolution and bandwidth as pressure increases. Citation 1 states: 'The experiments were conducted at pressures 0.1–1.7 MPa with a resolution becoming lowered at rising pressure. When going to pressure 1.7 MPa, the measuring system bandwidth comprised 20 Hz and specimen height resolution 0.08 mm.' This demonstrates a clear pressure-dependent degradation in both temporal resolution (bandwidth reduction to 20 Hz) and spatial resolution (0.08 mm height resolution). Additionally, multiple optical interference factors contribute to performance degradation. Citation 2 explains: 'In addition, the flame emits the light which has to be compensated by the recording system whereas the combustion products typically contain radiation scattering particulates generated via dispersion of the surface layer and/or due to formation of condensed combustion products.' These factors - flame luminosity requiring compensation and radiation scattering by combustion particulates - reduce signal quality and spatial resolution. The paper also notes that burning surface roughness of 20–200 μm due to typical oxidizer grain size further complicates optical measurements. Combined, these factors lead to reduced signal-to-noise ratio, decreased spatial resolution, and limited effective bandwidth, making optical methods less suitable for high-frequency transient measurements at elevated pressures compared to alternative techniques like microwave methods.",

It correctly identifies: (1) pressure-dependent degradation with specific values (20 Hz bandwidth and 0.08 mm resolution at 1.7 MPa) matching Citation 1; (2) optical interference factors including flame luminosity and radiation scattering by particulates matching Citation 2; (3) appropriate interpretation of these factors leading to reduced signal quality and measurement limitations. The answer also adds contextually appropriate information about burning surface roughness (20-200 μm) and comparison to microwave methods, which, while not directly quoted, represents reasonable technical elaboration consistent with combustion diagnostics principles.
