  "question_text": "Explain the mechanisms of carbon deposition (coking) on Ni-based SOFC anodes during methane conversion, focusing on how it blocks active sites and degrades performance, and discuss mitigation strategies based on thermodynamic considerations.",
  "standard_answer": "Carbon deposition on Ni-based SOFC anodes occurs primarily through methane decomposition and side reactions that form solid carbon on catalytic surfaces. This process blocks access to surface active sites from reacting species, leading to deactivation of the catalytic activity of the anode and subsequent degradation of cell performance. Thermodynamically, carbon formation is favored under reducing conditions with low oxygen chemical potentials, where carbon activity exceeds unity. Mitigation strategies include using alternative anode materials that resist coking, doping Ni with other elements to alter surface chemistry, and operating with steam or CO2 co-feed to shift equilibria toward gasification reactions that remove carbon. These approaches leverage materials science to suppress carbon formation while maintaining electrochemical activity for efficient methane conversion in SOFC systems.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains carbon deposition mechanisms on Ni-based SOFC anodes, correctly identifying methane decomposition as the primary pathway and accurately describing how carbon blocks active sites leading to deactivation and performance degradation. The thermodynamic explanation (carbon formation favored under reducing conditions with low oxygen chemical potential when carbon activity exceeds unity) is scientifically sound. The mitigation strategies listed (alternative anode materials, Ni doping, steam/CO2 co-feed for gasification) directly align with the original text. While the answer provides more detail than the original text (e.g., thermodynamic considerations, carbon activity), all additional information is factually correct and relevant to the question.

The added thermodynamic framing (favoring carbon under low oxygen potential and carbon activity > 1) is accurate and consistent with SOFC anode environments. No factual or logical errors detected.",
