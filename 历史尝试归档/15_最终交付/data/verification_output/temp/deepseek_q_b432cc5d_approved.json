  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how incomplete spray evaporation leads to liquid film and deposit formation in SCR systems, and describe the role of spray characteristics and system geometry in this process.",
  "standard_answer": "Incomplete spray evaporation in SCR systems occurs when UWS droplets do not fully evaporate before reaching surfaces in the mixing section. This leads to droplet impingement on walls and mixing elements, resulting in liquid/wall contact. The paper states that 'Due to highly transient conditions and short mixing lengths, incomplete spray evaporation can result in liquid/wall contact and formation of solid urea deposits lowering ammonia selectivity and homogeneity.' When spray impinges on surfaces, 'high thermal and kinetic energies dominating spray impingement lead to secondary atomization, which is beneficial in terms of ammonia generation. For low thermal and kinetic energies, spray impact may result in partial wetting of the surface. Consequently, the surface temperature is decreased by evaporative cooling enhancing further liquid deposition. By accumulation, liquid films are formed on the mixing elements and tailpipe walls.' Spray characteristics play a crucial role as 'Spray quality is generally characterized by global and local spray parameters, including the initial jet velocity, the spray angle, spray penetration and both the droplet size and velocity distribution.' System geometry also significantly influences this process since 'For pressure driven, airless injection, the spray cone width is continuously increasing by the initial spray cone angle, resulting in a larger area of potential droplet impingement at the opposite wall.' These liquid films then undergo thermal decomposition, but undesired reactions can form solid by-products that modify surface properties and impair ammonia uniformity.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the mechanism of incomplete spray evaporation leading to liquid film and deposit formation in SCR systems. It correctly incorporates both original text excerpts verbatim (marked with quotes) and provides accurate contextual explanations. The answer properly describes: (1) how incomplete evaporation leads to droplet impingement and liquid/wall contact, (2) the role of thermal and kinetic energies in determining whether secondary atomization or surface wetting occurs, (3) how evaporative cooling and accumulation lead to liquid film formation, (4) the importance of spray characteristics (velocity, angle, penetration, droplet size/velocity distribution), and (5) how system geometry affects impingement area. The physical principles are sound - the cause-effect relationships between spray quality, impingement dynamics, surface wetting, and deposit formation are logically consistent with combustion and fluid mechanics principles. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and consistent with the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly reflects the original text: incomplete evaporation causes liquid/wall contact leading to solid deposits and reduced ammonia selectivity/homogeneity, and airless injection geometry increases impingement area via the expanding spray cone. The elaborations on spray impingement energy, secondary atomization, partial wetting, evaporative cooling, and accumulation into liquid films are physically sound and logically consistent with deposit formation mechanisms.
