  "question_text": "Calculate the working capacity of an MOF for CO2 capture given adsorption capacities of 8.6 mmol/g at feed conditions (40°C, 0.15 bar CO2) and 2.0 mmol/g at desorption conditions (200°C, 0.01 bar CO2). How does this compare to the energy required for regeneration if the heat of adsorption is 40 kJ/mol?",
  "standard_answer": "The working capacity is calculated as the difference between adsorption capacity at feed and desorption conditions: 8.6 mmol/g - 2.0 mmol/g = 6.6 mmol/g. This represents the net CO2 captured per cycle per gram of MOF. To assess energy requirements, the heat required for regeneration per gram of MOF is determined by the working capacity and the heat of adsorption. For 6.6 mmol/g of CO2 desorbed, the energy is (6.6 mmol/g) × (40 kJ/mol) = 264 J/g, since 1 mmol = 0.001 mol, so 6.6 mmol = 0.0066 mol, and 0.0066 mol × 40 kJ/mol = 0.264 kJ/g = 264 J/g. This energy must be supplied to break adsorbate-adsorbent bonds during desorption. Compared to other processes, such as amine-based capture which may require higher temperatures and have heats of adsorption around 60–80 kJ/mol, this MOF shows favorable energy characteristics due to its moderate heat of adsorption and high working capacity, but practical systems must also account for sensible heat to heat the MOF bed and heat losses.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Working capacities (defined as the difference between CO2 uptake capacity of MOFs at feed condition and desorption condition at the end of purge step) comparable to the amine process, the MOF must be heated to around 200 °C.",
    "2": "Mg-MOF-74 possesses the highest working capacity for post-combustion CO2 sequestration at 5.87 mmol g−1 at ambient temperature."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly calculates the working capacity as 6.6 mmol/g (8.6 - 2.0 mmol/g), which is consistent with the definition provided in the original text. The energy calculation is mathematically correct: 6.6 mmol/g × 40 kJ/mol = 0.0066 mol/g × 40 kJ/mol = 0.264 kJ/g = 264 J/g. The answer appropriately compares this to amine-based capture systems and notes the favorable energy characteristics due to moderate heat of adsorption. The mention of 200°C desorption temperature aligns with the original text. The comparison to Mg-MOF-74's working capacity of 5.87 mmol/g from the original text provides context that the calculated 6.6 mmol/g is reasonable and competitive. All thermodynamic principles are correctly stated, and the reasoning about regeneration energy requirements is sound.",

        "reasoning": "The working capacity calculation (8.6 − 2.0 = 6.6 mmol/g) is correct per the definition. The regeneration energy estimate using the heat of adsorption is computed correctly: 0.0066 mol/g × 40 kJ/mol = 0.264 kJ/g = 264 J/g. The answer aligns with the ground truth on working capacity definition and acknowledges additional practical energy components.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly calculates the working capacity by subtracting the desorption capacity from the adsorption capacity (8.6 - 2.0 = 6.6 mmol/g), which is consistent with the definition in the original text. The calculation for the regeneration energy is also correct: (6.6 mmol/g) * (40 kJ/mol) = 0.264 kJ/g = 264 J/g. The comparison with amine-based capture, noting their typically higher heats of adsorption (60-80 kJ/mol), is factually accurate. Finally, the answer correctly points out the importance of sensible heat in practical systems, which is a crucial aspect of process energy analysis. All statements are factually and thermodynamically sound.",
