  "question_text": "Calculate the Knudsen diffusion coefficient for O2 molecules at 1500 K in a char pore with mean radius of 100 nm, and explain how this value compares to bulk diffusion and affects overall mass transport in char conversion.",
  "standard_answer": "The Knudsen diffusion coefficient for O2 molecules can be calculated using the formula D_Kn,i = (2r_pore/3)√(8R_uT_p/πM_i). For O2 with molecular weight M_i = 0.032 kg/mol, at T_p = 1500 K, with pore radius r_pore = 100 nm = 1×10^-7 m, and universal gas constant R_u = 8.314 J/(mol·K): D_Kn,O2 = (2×1×10^-7/3) × √(8×8.314×1500/(π×0.032)) = (6.67×10^-8) × √(99768/0.1005) = (6.67×10^-8) × √992,000 = (6.67×10^-8) × 996 = 6.64×10^-5 m²/s. This Knudsen diffusion coefficient of approximately 6.6×10^-5 m²/s should be compared to typical bulk diffusion coefficients for O2 in combustion environments, which are on the order of 1×10^-4 to 5×10^-4 m²/s at similar temperatures. Since D_Kn and D_bulk are comparable in magnitude, both mechanisms contribute significantly to overall transport. The effective diffusion coefficient follows the harmonic mean relationship 1/D_eff ∝ 1/D_bulk + 1/D_Kn, meaning the smaller of the two coefficients dominates. In this case, since D_Kn ≈ 0.66×D_bulk (assuming D_bulk ≈ 1×10^-4 m²/s), the effective diffusivity would be reduced to about 40% of the bulk value. This demonstrates that in mesopores around 100 nm, Knudsen diffusion substantially limits mass transport and therefore char conversion rates, particularly in Zone II conditions where both diffusion and reaction rates are important.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly applies the Knudsen diffusion formula D_Kn,i = (2r_pore/3)√(8R_uT_p/πM_i) from the original text. The numerical calculation is accurate: using r_pore = 1×10^-7 m, T_p = 1500 K, M_i = 0.032 kg/mol, and R_u = 8.314 J/(mol·K), the result D_Kn,O2 ≈ 6.64×10^-5 m²/s is correct. The comparison to bulk diffusion coefficients (1×10^-4 to 5×10^-4 m²/s) is reasonable for high-temperature combustion environments. The explanation of the harmonic mean relationship for effective diffusivity (1/D_eff ∝ 1/D_bulk + 1/D_Kn) is physically sound and correctly identifies that the smaller coefficient dominates. The conclusion that Knudsen diffusion substantially limits mass transport in 100 nm mesopores is consistent with the original text's statement that Knudsen diffusion is important when molecules collide with pore walls as often as with each other. All physical principles, calculations, and logical reasoning are correct.",

        "reasoning": "The formula used for Knudsen diffusivity matches the ground-truth expression, the numerical calculation is correct (D_Kn ≈ 6.6×10^-5 m^2/s for r = 100 nm at 1500 K for O2), and the comparison to typical bulk diffusion values at high temperature is reasonable. The use of the Bosanquet (harmonic mean) relationship and the conclusion that the smaller diffusivity limits overall transport are correct. The discussion appropriately connects Knudsen effects to mesoporous char and mixed control (Zone II). No factual or logical errors found.",
