  "question_text": "In the context of level set methods for atomization and evaporation simulations, how does the hyperbolic tangent level set method improve mass conservation compared to the basic signed distance function approach, and what is the primary trade-off regarding interface representation?",
  "standard_answer": "The hyperbolic tangent level set method improves mass conservation by replacing the standard signed distance function with a hyperbolic tangent profile that maintains a constant interface thickness controlled by parameter ε. This formulation creates a bounded level set function between 0 and 1, which reduces numerical diffusion that typically causes mass loss in conventional level set methods. The method achieves second-order accuracy and provides satisfactory mass conservation in the region bounded by the interface. However, this improved mass conservation comes at the cost of reduced interface sharpness. The hyperbolic tangent formulation, while roughly conservative, diminishes the sharpness of the level set method compared to the basic signed distance function approach. This trade-off between mass conservation and interface sharpness represents a fundamental compromise in the method's application to atomization and evaporation simulations where accurate interface tracking is crucial for predicting droplet formation and evaporation dynamics.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Instead of the signed distance function, Olsson et al. [64,65] proposed to use the hyperbolic tangent function as the level set function. It is of second-order accuracy and satisfactory of mass conservation in the region bounded by the interface.",
    "2": "Through this hyperbolic tangent level set method, the mass loss can be considerably reduced [66-69]. However, this method also reduces the sharpness of the level set method in spite of its roughly conservative property."
