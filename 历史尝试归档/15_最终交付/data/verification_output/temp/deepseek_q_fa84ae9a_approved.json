  "question_text": "How does the presence of solid bed material in fluidized-bed reactors enhance ammonia combustion stability and reduce ignition energy requirements compared to traditional flow reactors?",
  "standard_answer": "The solid bed material in fluidized-bed reactors significantly enhances ammonia combustion stability and reduces ignition energy requirements through multiple mechanisms. First, the bed particles act as a massive heat reservoir due to their high thermal capacity, maintaining temperatures above ammonia's autoignition point (~930 K) even during flow fluctuations. This thermal inertia prevents flame extinction and ensures continuous ignition. Second, the intense gas-solid mixing in fluidized beds creates excellent heat and mass transfer conditions, promoting more uniform temperature distribution and faster reaction rates. Third, the bed material provides surface area for heterogeneous reactions and radical recombination, potentially catalyzing ammonia oxidation. As evidence, fixed-bed studies show onset reaction temperatures ~20% lower than flow reactors (1050 K vs 1300 K at stoichiometric conditions), demonstrating the bed's ignition-enhancing effect. The fluidized state further improves this by eliminating channeling and ensuring complete reactant-bed contact. This combination of thermal stability, enhanced transport, and potential catalytic effects allows fluidized beds to overcome ammonia's high minimum ignition energy (~20 mJ) and poor flame stability characteristics.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the mechanisms by which solid bed material enhances ammonia combustion stability and reduces ignition energy requirements. Key points verified: (1) The bed material acts as a heat reservoir maintaining temperatures above autoignition point - consistent with original text [1]. (2) The numerical data (onset reaction temperature ~20% lower, 1050 K vs 1300 K at stoichiometric conditions) matches original text [2] exactly. (3) Additional explanations about gas-solid mixing, heat/mass transfer, heterogeneous reactions, and catalytic effects are physically sound and represent reasonable elaborations beyond the original text. (4) The mention of ammonia's autoignition point (~930 K) and minimum ignition energy (~20 mJ) are consistent with established combustion science literature. (5) The causal relationships (thermal inertia prevents flame extinction, enhanced transport improves reaction rates) are logically correct. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all statements are factually accurate and consistent with combustion science principles.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer is broadly consistent with the ground-truth points: the fluidised-bed's hot solids act as a large heat reservoir that stabilizes ignition, and fixed-bed onset temperatures are ~20% lower than flow reactors (1050 K vs 1300 K at φ = 1). However, it introduces a significant factual error by giving ammonia's MIE as ~20 mJ and labeling it high, and it suggests radical recombination on bed surfaces as a mechanism that could catalyze oxidation, which is logically inconsistent since such recombination tends to suppress combustion. These issues warrant marking the answer as incorrect despite the otherwise sound thermal and mixing arguments.",
