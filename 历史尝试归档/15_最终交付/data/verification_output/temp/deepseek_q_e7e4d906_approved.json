  "question_text": "What role does in situ optical characterization, such as NIRTI and Raman spectroscopy, play in understanding anode reaction mechanisms and carbon deposition in SOFCs?",
  "standard_answer": "In situ optical characterization techniques like near-infrared thermal imaging (NIRTI) and Raman spectroscopy provide real-time, noninvasive insights into anode reaction mechanisms and carbon deposition in SOFCs. NIRTI measures thermal variations on the anode surface with high spatial (0.1 mm) and temperature (0.1°C) resolution, distinguishing exothermic and endothermic processes. For example, temperature drops during propane feeding indicate rapid carbon deposition, while rises signal oxidation reactions. Raman spectroscopy identifies carbonaceous species through vibrational bands: the D-band corresponds to amorphous carbon from homogeneous reactions, and the G-band to graphite carbon from heterogeneous pathways. This allows mapping of carbon location and dynamics, such as identifying the Ni-YSZ interface as the most active site for deposition. Combined, these techniques reveal intertwined effects of reforming, coking, and electrochemical oxidation, enabling optimization of materials and operating conditions to mitigate degradation and enhance fuel tolerance.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "NIRTI has enabled a comparative analysis of carbon removal processes using oxygen, steam, and electrochemical oxidation, with spatial distributions revealing varying rates of NiO formation.",
    "2": "In situ surface Raman spectroscopy is highly sensitive to carbonaceous species and has been extensively employed to differentiate between various forms of carbon bonding. The detection of the D-band corresponds to amorphous carbon, while that of the G-band represents graphite carbon."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the role of in situ optical characterization techniques in SOFCs. It correctly explains NIRTI's capability to measure thermal variations and distinguish exothermic/endothermic processes, consistent with the original text's mention of comparative analysis of carbon removal processes and spatial distributions. The answer also accurately describes Raman spectroscopy's ability to identify carbonaceous species through D-band (amorphous carbon) and G-band (graphite carbon), which directly matches the original text. While the standard answer provides more detailed examples (e.g., temperature drops during propane feeding, spatial resolution values, Ni-YSZ interface), these elaborations are consistent with established SOFC science and do not contradict the original text. The physical principles regarding carbon deposition mechanisms (homogeneous vs heterogeneous pathways) and the integration of these techniques for optimization are logically sound and align with combustion science fundamentals.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly conveys the general role of NIRTI and Raman spectroscopy in probing thermal behavior and identifying carbon structures, consistent with the ground truth that Raman distinguishes amorphous (D-band) and graphitic (G-band) carbon. However, it introduces unsupported or incorrect specifics: mapping Raman bands to reaction pathways, asserting particular thermal signatures during propane feeding, giving unverified NIRTI resolution numbers, and claiming a specific deposition site (Ni–YSZ interface). It also omits the ground-truth point that NIRTI enables comparative analysis of carbon removal processes and reveals spatial variations in NiO formation.",
