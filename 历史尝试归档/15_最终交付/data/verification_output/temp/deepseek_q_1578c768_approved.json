  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain the mechanisms of inertial impaction in ash deposition processes and discuss how particle viscosity and kinetic energy influence the sticking behavior of silicate-rich ash particles upon impact with heat exchanger surfaces.",
  "standard_answer": "Inertial impaction is a key ash deposition mechanism where particles with sufficient momentum deviate from fluid streamlines and impact surfaces. The paper states that 'Inertial impaction occurs when particles with sufficient inertia deviate from fluid streamlines and impact surfaces, dominating for larger particles in high-velocity flows near obstacles like tubes.' For silicate-rich ash particles, the sticking behavior upon impact is primarily governed by particle viscosity and kinetic energy. The paper emphasizes that 'the particle viscosity is confirmed as a key parameter for silicate-rich ashes' and that 'the sticking and rebound threshold is a function of the particle kinetic energy, the angle of impaction, and the particle viscosity.' During particle impaction, if all kinetic energy is dissipated through viscous deformation, the particle will remain on the surface. The paper explains that 'if all kinetic energy is dissipated during the impact, the particle will remain on the surface' and further notes that 'the majority of depositing particles are dominated by the work of deformation against viscosity, rather than surface tension effects.' This highlights that for silicate-rich ashes, accurate prediction of temperature- and composition-dependent viscosity is crucial for determining whether impacting particles will stick or rebound from heat exchanger surfaces.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains inertial impaction mechanisms and the role of particle viscosity and kinetic energy in ash deposition. All key points are correctly extracted from the original text: (1) inertial impaction occurs when particles deviate from streamlines due to sufficient inertia, dominating for larger particles in high-velocity flows; (2) particle viscosity is a key parameter for silicate-rich ashes; (3) sticking/rebound depends on particle kinetic energy, impact angle, and viscosity; (4) particles stick when all kinetic energy is dissipated during impact; (5) deformation work against viscosity dominates over surface tension effects. The answer correctly paraphrases and integrates these concepts with appropriate direct quotations. No factual errors, logical contradictions, or misrepresentations of the physical principles are present.",

The brief mention of temperature- and composition-dependent viscosity is a reasonable, non-contradictory elaboration. No factual or logical errors found.",
