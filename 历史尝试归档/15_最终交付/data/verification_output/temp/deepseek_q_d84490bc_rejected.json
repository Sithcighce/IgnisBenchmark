  "question_text": "What is the critical radius for autoignition (rc) from a hotspot according to the Frank-Kamenetskii criterion, and how does it depend on thermal conductivity and activation energy? Explain the physical mechanisms behind these dependencies.",
  "standard_answer": "The critical radius for autoignition (rc) is derived from the Frank-Kamenetskii criterion for thermal explosion in a reactive mixture. It represents the minimum hotspot size required to overcome heat losses and sustain spontaneous ignition. The equation is: rc = (δc k Ta / A Q En exp(-En))^(1/2), where δc is the critical Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, k is thermal conductivity, Ta is ambient temperature, A is the pre-exponential factor, Q is fuel mass per volume multiplied by reaction enthalpy, and En = E/(R Ta) with E as activation energy. The dependence on thermal conductivity is inverse with the square root - higher k increases rc because enhanced heat dissipation from the hotspot to cooler surroundings retards the temperature rise needed for ignition. For activation energy, the relationship is more complex due to the exp(-En) term. Since En = E/(R Ta), higher activation energy E increases En, which increases exp(-En) in the denominator, thereby increasing rc. This means higher activation energy makes autoignition more difficult, requiring a larger hotspot to overcome the energy barrier and initiate self-sustaining reactions. The physical mechanism involves balancing chemical heat generation against conductive heat losses - when the hotspot is too small, heat dissipation dominates and prevents thermal runaway.",

The correct reasoning should be: higher E increases En, which DECREASES exp(-En), thereby DECREASING the denominator, which INCREASES rc. While the final conclusion (higher E increases rc) is correct, the intermediate logical step contains a clear mathematical error that misrepresents how the exponential function behaves.",
