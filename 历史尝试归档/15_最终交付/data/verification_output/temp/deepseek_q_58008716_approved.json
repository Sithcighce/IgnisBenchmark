  "question_text": "How does the use of a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) in continuous-flow CO2 electrolyzers overcome mass transport limitations and enhance current density compared to batch reactors?",
  "standard_answer": "Gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) overcome mass transport limitations in continuous-flow CO2 electrolyzers by creating a three-phase interface where CO2 gas, liquid electrolyte, and solid catalyst interact directly. In batch reactors, CO2 solubility in aqueous electrolytes is low (~30 mM), limiting the maximum current density to ~60 mA cm⁻² due to semi-infinite diffusion constraints. GDEs allow CO2 to be supplied directly as a gas to the catalyst layer through a porous, hydrophobic gas diffusion layer (GDL), bypassing dissolution limitations. This increases the effective CO2 concentration at the catalyst surface, enabling current densities exceeding 300 mA cm⁻². The continuous flow of electrolyte prevents product accumulation, reduces diffusion layer thickness, and maintains a stable local pH, further enhancing reaction rates. The GDE's porous structure extends the electroactive surface area and ensures efficient electron transfer from the current collector, while the microporous layer optimizes wetting for sustained ionic conductivity without flooding, which would favor H2 evolution.",

    "1": "This arrangement overcomes most of the problems associated with the other setups, namely: (i) current limitation due to the low concentration of CO2 at the electrode; (ii) H+ crossover from the anode and the consequent acidification of the catholyte;",
    "2": "Using a simple semi-infinite diffusion model, the limiting current density attainable at this concentration is approximately IL = 60 mA cm‒2 under vigorous stirring [22]."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains how GDEs overcome mass transport limitations in CO2 electrolyzers. Key facts are correct: (1) CO2 solubility limitation of ~30 mM in batch reactors, (2) current density limit of ~60 mA cm⁻² from semi-infinite diffusion, (3) GDEs enabling >300 mA cm⁻² by direct gas supply. The answer correctly describes the three-phase interface mechanism, the role of the hydrophobic GDL in bypassing dissolution limitations, and how continuous flow prevents product accumulation and maintains stable pH. The explanation of the microporous layer preventing flooding while maintaining ionic conductivity is consistent with electrochemical engineering principles. While the answer is more detailed than the original text excerpts, all statements are factually accurate and logically sound, with no contradictions to the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly identifies the mass transport limitation in batch CO2 electrolysis due to low CO2 solubility and aligns with the semi-infinite diffusion limiting current (~60 mA cm⁻²) stated in the original text. It accurately explains how GDEs create a three-phase interface and deliver gaseous CO2 directly to the catalyst through a hydrophobic porous layer, mitigating solubility and diffusion constraints and enabling higher current densities. The points on flow mitigating product buildup, maintaining more stable local conditions, and preventing flooding (reducing HER) are consistent with established principles and do not contradict the ground truth. Overall, the reasoning is sound and matches the core mechanisms highlighted in the source.",
