  "question_text": "In a countercurrent fixed-bed biomass combustion experiment with multiple thermocouples placed along the bed height, the distance between adjacent thermocouples is 0.1 m and the raw bed bulk density is 400 kg/m³. The time differences for a reference temperature of 300°C to pass between consecutive thermocouple pairs are: 200 s between positions 1-2, 210 s between positions 2-3, and 190 s between positions 3-4. Calculate the ignition front velocity using the proper averaging method and determine the ignition rate. Explain the physical significance of these parameters and their relationship to the pyrolysis process in fixed-bed combustion.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate the ignition front velocity, we must use the averaging method specified in the literature. First, we calculate the velocity between each thermocouple pair: v₁₂ = 0.1 m / 200 s = 0.0005 m/s, v₂₃ = 0.1 m / 210 s = 0.000476 m/s, v₃₄ = 0.1 m / 190 s = 0.000526 m/s. With NT = 4 thermocouples, the ignition front velocity is the average of these three values: v_ig = (0.0005 + 0.000476 + 0.000526) / 3 = 0.0005007 m/s ≈ 0.0005 m/s. The ignition rate is then calculated as m''_ig = ρ_b × v_ig = 400 kg/m³ × 0.0005 m/s = 0.2 kg/(s·m²). Physically, the ignition front velocity represents the propagation speed of the reaction zone through the bed, where fresh fuel particles undergo heating, drying, and pyrolysis. The ignition rate quantifies the mass of fuel entering the devolatilization phase per unit time and cross-sectional area. As the ignition front advances, it initiates pyrolysis in successive fuel layers, releasing volatile gases that mix with air and combust. The ignition rate is directly proportional to the pyrolysis rate since it determines how quickly fuel mass transitions into the volatile release phase. This relationship is crucial for designing air supply systems to match volatile production and ensure complete combustion while minimizing emissions.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Finally, the ignition front velocity vig is obtained by the average of the ratios estimated in the previous step: vig = 1/(NT-1) * Σ [(H_{i+1} - H_i) / (t(T_ref)_{i+1} - t(T_ref)_i)]",
    "2": "The ignition rate m''_ig is directly related to the bed's release rate of volatile gases, also called the pyrolysis rate. The ignition rate is the result of the product of the ignition front propagation velocity (vig) and the raw bed bulk density (ρ_b): m''_ig = ρ_b vig"
