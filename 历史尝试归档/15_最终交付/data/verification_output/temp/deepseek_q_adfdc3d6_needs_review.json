  "standard_answer": "The energy yield (EY_p) and mass yield (MY) for torrefied biomass can be calculated using the empirical correlations: EY_p = 10.0379 - 0.0144M + 0.9278T - 0.00721M^2 - 0.002461T^2 and ML_p = 95.68 - 1.0396T + 0.2491M + 0.00284T^2, where ML_p is predicted mass loss, MY = 100 - ML_p, T is temperature in °C, and M is moisture content in wt% dry basis. For example, at T=250°C and M=10%, ML_p = 95.68 - 1.0396*250 + 0.2491*10 + 0.00284*250^2 = 95.68 - 259.9 + 2.491 + 177.5 = 15.77%, so MY = 84.23%. Then EY_p = 10.0379 - 0.0144*10 + 0.9278*250 - 0.00721*100 - 0.002461*62500 = 10.0379 - 0.144 + 231.95 - 0.721 - 153.81 = 87.31%. The physical significance: Temperature (T) dominantly affects decomposition rates, with higher T increasing devolatilization and reducing MY but enhancing energy density. Moisture content (M) influences the initial drying phase, where higher M requires more energy for vaporization, slightly offsetting mass loss. The quadratic terms account for non-linear effects, such as accelerated decomposition at high T and moisture's role in reaction pathways. These correlations help optimize torrefaction conditions for desired fuel properties, balancing energy retention and mass reduction.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly reproduces the empirical correlations from the original text (EY_p and ML_p equations). The numerical calculation example is mathematically correct: ML_p = 95.68 - 259.9 + 2.491 + 177.5 = 15.771% (≈15.77%), giving MY = 84.23%, and EY_p = 10.0379 - 0.144 + 231.95 - 0.721 - 153.8125 = 87.3104% (≈87.31%). The physical significance explanations are sound and consistent with the original text's statement that temperature is the most significant variable affecting reaction rates. The discussion of moisture content's role in drying, the quadratic terms representing non-linear effects, and the optimization considerations are all scientifically accurate and logically consistent with torrefaction principles.",
