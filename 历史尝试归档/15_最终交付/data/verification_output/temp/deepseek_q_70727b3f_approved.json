  "question_text": "What mathematical formulations describe the heat transfer in PCMs during phase change, and how do these equations account for latent heat absorption/release?",
  "standard_answer": "The heat transfer in PCMs during phase change is described by modified heat conduction equations that incorporate latent heat effects. The fundamental equation derives from Fourier's law with an additional source term for latent heat. The one-dimensional form is: ∂T/∂t = α(∂²T/∂x²) + (1/ρcₚ)(dH/dt), where T is temperature, t is time, x is position, α is thermal diffusivity, ρ is density, cₚ is specific heat capacity, and dH/dt represents the rate of latent heat absorption/release. This formulation accounts for both sensible heat (temperature change) and latent heat (phase change) components. The total energy stored or released is given by Q_total = mcₚΔT + mL, where m is mass, L is latent heat of fusion/solidification, and ΔT is temperature change. During phase transition, the latent heat term dominates while temperature remains nearly constant, creating the characteristic plateau in temperature profiles. These equations form the basis for numerical simulations of PCM behavior in thermal energy storage systems, requiring careful treatment of the moving boundary between solid and liquid phases.",

    "1": "The basic heat conduction equation in one dimension is given by Fourier's law as in Equation (1): ∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²",
    "2": "During the phase change, the PCM absorbs or releases a significant amount of heat, known as latent heat, without a temperature change. To incorporate this into the heat conduction equation, an additional source term is added to represent the latent heat as in Equation (2): ∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x² + 1/ρcₚ dH/dt"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the mathematical formulations for heat transfer in PCMs during phase change. It correctly presents the modified heat conduction equation with the latent heat source term (∂T/∂t = α(∂²T/∂x²) + (1/ρcₚ)(dH/dt)), which matches the original text's Equation (2). The answer properly explains all variables and their physical meanings. The total energy equation (Q_total = mcₚΔT + mL) correctly separates sensible and latent heat components. The description of the temperature plateau during phase transition and the dominance of latent heat is physically accurate. While the answer provides additional context about numerical simulations and moving boundaries not explicitly mentioned in the original text excerpt, these are correct extensions of the core concepts and do not contradict the original text. All physical principles are stated correctly and the reasoning is logically sound.",
