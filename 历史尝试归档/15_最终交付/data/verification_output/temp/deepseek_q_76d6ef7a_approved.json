  "standard_answer": "Intraparticle heat transfer governs torrefaction kinetics in large biomass particles due to finite thermal conductivity, leading to significant temperature gradients and thermal overshoot. For particles larger than 2 mm, internal heat transfer resistance becomes dominant, causing the centerline temperature to exceed the surface temperature during devolatilization. This overshoot accelerates reaction rates locally, as described by the proportionality ΔT_c-s ∝ (-Q_r R^2)/k, where ΔT_c-s is the center-to-surface temperature difference, Q_r is the volumetric heat release rate from exothermic reactions (e.g., hemicellulose decomposition), R is particle radius, and k is effective thermal conductivity. The derivation stems from the energy balance within the particle: assuming steady-state heat conduction with internal heat generation, the temperature profile follows ∇·(k∇T) + Q_r = 0. For a spherical particle, solving this yields T(r) = T_s + (Q_r/(6k))(R^2 - r^2), showing that the maximum temperature at the center (r=0) is T_c = T_s + (Q_r R^2)/(6k). Thus, the overshoot scales quadratically with particle radius. This phenomenon is critical because it reduces the required residence time for complete torrefaction but can lead to non-uniform product quality if not controlled. As the paper notes, 'the centerline temperature overshoot to increase with particle size, with larger particles showing higher temperatures and accelerated reaction rates.'",

It accurately states the proportionality relationship ΔT_c-s ∝ (-Q_r R^2)/k from the original text, correctly derives the temperature profile from the energy balance equation ∇·(k∇T) + Q_r = 0, and properly solves for the spherical case to obtain T_c = T_s + (Q_r R^2)/(6k). The quadratic scaling with particle radius is correct. The threshold of 2 mm for heat transfer limitations matches the original text. The physical principles (heat conduction with internal generation, exothermic reactions causing overshoot) are sound. The quoted text matches the original source.

However, it contains a clear internal contradiction in the sign of the ΔT_c–s relation: it first presents a negative proportionality, then derives a positive expression. This sign inconsistency constitutes a logical error. Other aspects (particle-size threshold and mechanism) are consistent.",
