  "question_text": "Based on the Glarborg et al. (2018) review, explain the chemical mechanisms through which reburning reduces NO in combustion systems, focusing on the role of hydrocarbon radicals and the specific pathways described in the paper's reburning section. Include the key chemical transformations and how local conditions affect these processes.",
  "standard_answer": "Reburning reduces NO through chemical interactions between NO and hydrocarbon radicals (CHn-radicals) that convert NO into cyanides and isocyanides, diverting nitrogen away from NO formation pathways. Under fuel-rich conditions, the chemistry shifts from oxidation pathways to reactions that generate CHn-radicals like CH3, which are precursors to more reactive radicals such as CH. These CHn-radicals react efficiently with NO to form cyanides (HCN) and isocyanides (HNC), as supported by the paper: 'Recycling of amine radicals and NO back to HCN through reaction with hydrocarbon radicals becomes dominant. At richer conditions the reactions of CH3 leading to CHn-radicals are favored compared to the oxidation pathways leading to formaldehyde.' Additionally, 'Reactions between the CHn-radicals and NO then efficiently convert NO to cyanides and isocyanides.' The efficiency of reburning is highly dependent on local equivalence ratio and temperature; under reducing (fuel-rich) conditions, high concentrations of CHn-radicals enhance these conversion reactions, while under lean conditions, oxidation pathways dominate, limiting NO reduction. In practical systems, reburning is implemented by injecting secondary fuel to create a reducing zone where these reactions occur, but the paper does not specify quantitative reduction percentages like 50-60%, focusing instead on the chemical mechanisms.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the reburning mechanism for NO reduction. It correctly explains that: (1) CHn-radicals react with NO to form cyanides (HCN) and isocyanides (HNC), (2) under fuel-rich conditions, CH3 reactions favor CHn-radical formation over oxidation pathways to formaldehyde, (3) amine radicals and NO are recycled back to HCN through hydrocarbon radical reactions, and (4) local conditions (equivalence ratio and temperature) affect process efficiency. All statements are directly supported by the original text quotes and are consistent with established combustion chemistry principles. The answer appropriately notes that the paper focuses on chemical mechanisms rather than quantitative reduction percentages. No factual errors or logical contradictions detected.",
