  "question_text": "Calculate the total thermal energy storage capacity of a nano-enhanced PCM system containing 2 kg of paraffin wax (latent heat 200 kJ/kg, specific heat 2.0 kJ/kg·K) with 1 wt% nanoparticles, where the nanoparticles cause a 5% reduction in latent heat capacity. The system operates over a 15°C temperature range during sensible heating, followed by phase change. Assume the nanoparticles have negligible specific heat capacity compared to the PCM.",
  "standard_answer": "The total thermal energy storage capacity Q_total consists of sensible heat during temperature change and latent heat during phase change. For the nano-enhanced PCM system: Mass of PCM = 2 kg, Mass of nanoparticles = 0.02 kg (1% of total). The effective latent heat is reduced by 5% due to nanoparticle inclusion: L_effective = 200 kJ/kg × 0.95 = 190 kJ/kg. The sensible heat component occurs over ΔT = 15°C during heating before phase change. Using Q_total = m_PCMc_p,PCMΔT + m_PCML_effective, where the mass terms apply specifically to the PCM portion since nanoparticles have negligible specific heat and don't contribute to latent heat storage. The sensible heat storage: Q_sensible = (2 kg) × (2.0 kJ/kg·K) × (15 K) = 60 kJ. The latent heat storage: Q_latent = (2 kg) × (190 kJ/kg) = 380 kJ. Total energy storage capacity: Q_total = 60 kJ + 380 kJ = 440 kJ. This calculation demonstrates the trade-off between enhanced thermal conductivity (enabling faster charging/discharging) and reduced latent heat capacity due to nanoparticle inclusion. The 1% nanoparticle loading provides significant thermal conductivity improvement while maintaining most of the original energy storage capacity, consistent with research showing 80-150% thermal conductivity enhancement at 1-2% nanoparticle loading.",

    "2": "With nanomaterial NePCM displayed 80–150 % increment in organic PCM as their proportion of nanomaterial inclusion is about 1–2 %, whereas for form and shape stable PCM enhancement of 700–900 % in thermal conductivity is noticed; however, there was a drop in heat storage enthalpy owing to the inclusion of nanomaterial in weight fraction of 5–20 %."

          "Incorrect mass calculation: The problem states '2 kg of paraffin wax with 1 wt% nanoparticles', meaning the total system mass is 2 kg, not that there are 2 kg of pure PCM plus additional nanoparticles",

When a system contains '2 kg of paraffin wax with 1 wt% nanoparticles', this means the total mass is 2 kg with 1% being nanoparticles and 99% being PCM. The answer incorrectly treats it as 2 kg of pure PCM plus 0.02 kg of nanoparticles (total 2.02 kg). This leads to incorrect numerical results.
