  "question_text": "Analyze the temperature-dependent mechanisms of chlorine-induced corrosion in municipal solid waste incineration plants, focusing on the critical temperature threshold for superheater tube corrosion and the role of alkali chloride eutectic compounds. Explain how these temperature effects influence plant operational parameters and efficiency constraints.",
  "standard_answer": "Chlorine-induced corrosion in MSW incineration plants exhibits strong temperature dependence that significantly impacts superheater tube degradation. The paper establishes that 'At temperatures > 450 °C, boiler tubes consequently suffer from Cl-initiated corrosion,' indicating this temperature threshold as critical for corrosion initiation. This temperature dependence forces WtE plants to operate at lower steam temperatures (typically below 470°C) to minimize corrosion rates, thereby reducing electrical efficiency to only 15-25%. The corrosion mechanisms involve 'Corrosion by alkali chloride eutectic compounds' that form on tube surfaces. These eutectic compounds create aggressive corrosive environments specifically at elevated temperatures, where their chemical reactivity and transport properties are enhanced. The temperature limitation represents a fundamental constraint on plant efficiency and operational parameters in MSW incineration facilities, as higher temperatures would accelerate corrosion rates while lower temperatures reduce thermodynamic efficiency.",

It correctly identifies the >450°C threshold for Cl-initiated corrosion and the role of alkali chloride eutectic compounds. The explanation of operational constraints (steam temperatures below 470°C, electrical efficiency of 15-25%) and the temperature-dependent corrosion mechanisms are logically consistent with established combustion science. The cause-effect relationships between temperature, corrosion rates, and efficiency constraints are correctly stated. While the answer provides additional context beyond the minimal original text, all elaborations are scientifically accurate and relevant to the question.",
