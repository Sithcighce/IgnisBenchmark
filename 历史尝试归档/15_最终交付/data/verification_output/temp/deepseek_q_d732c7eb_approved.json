  "question_text": "Calculate the theoretical specific energy of iron (Fe) when combusted with air to form Fe₂O₃, given the standard enthalpy of formation of Fe₂O₃ is -822 kJ/mol and atomic mass of Fe is 55.85 g/mol. Compare this with the specific energy of aluminum (Al) combusted to Al₂O₃, with enthalpy of formation -1676 kJ/mol and atomic mass 26.98 g/mol.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate the specific energy, use the formula: Specific Energy = |ΔH_f| / (molar mass of fuel). For iron: Reaction: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃; ΔH_f for Fe₂O₃ is -822 kJ/mol, so for 2 moles of Fe₂O₃, ΔH = 2 * (-822) = -1644 kJ. Mass of iron consumed: 4 mol * 55.85 g/mol = 223.4 g = 0.2234 kg. Specific Energy = 1644 kJ / 0.2234 kg = 7358 kJ/kg ≈ 7.36 MJ/kg. For aluminum: Reaction: 4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃; ΔH_f for Al₂O₃ is -1676 kJ/mol, so for 2 moles, ΔH = 2 * (-1676) = -3352 kJ. Mass of aluminum: 4 mol * 26.98 g/mol = 107.92 g = 0.10792 kg. Specific Energy = 3352 kJ / 0.10792 kg = 31058 kJ/kg ≈ 31.06 MJ/kg. Comparison: Aluminum has a specific energy of 31.06 MJ/kg, which is over four times higher than iron's 7.36 MJ/kg, making aluminum more suitable for high-energy applications despite iron's abundance and lower cost.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer provides accurate thermochemical calculations for both iron and aluminum combustion. The stoichiometry is correct (4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ and 4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃), the enthalpy calculations are properly executed (multiplying formation enthalpies by 2 moles), mass calculations are accurate, and the specific energy calculations follow the correct formula. The numerical results (Fe: 7.36 MJ/kg, Al: 31.06 MJ/kg) are mathematically sound. The comparison correctly identifies aluminum as having approximately 4 times higher specific energy than iron, which is consistent with the original text's statement that metals have high energy densities and can be used as fuels. The conclusion about aluminum being more suitable for high-energy applications is a reasonable inference supported by the calculations. No factual errors, logical contradictions, or inconsistencies with the original text were found.",

Energy release is properly referenced per mass of metal consumed: Fe → 7.36 MJ/kg and Al → 31.06 MJ/kg, using 4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3 and 4Al + 3O2 → 2Al2O3. Comparison (Al ~4.2× Fe) is accurate. Consistent with metals as fuels burned in air; nitrogen does not affect ΔH. No factual or logical errors.",

The mass of the fuel consumed is calculated correctly from the stoichiometry and atomic masses. The final specific energy values are derived correctly from these quantities.
