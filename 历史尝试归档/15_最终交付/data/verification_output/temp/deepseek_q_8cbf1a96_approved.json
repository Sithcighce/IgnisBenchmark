  "question_text": "How does the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of surfactants determine the emulsion type (water-in-oil vs oil-in-water) and affect droplet size distribution in emulsion fuel formulations?",
  "standard_answer": "The HLB value quantitatively represents a surfactant's affinity for water versus oil phases, calculated as HLB = 20 × (Mw,h/(Mw,h + Mw,t)), where Mw,h and Mw,t are molecular weights of hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail groups. For water-in-diesel emulsions, surfactants with low HLB values (typically 3-6) are required because they preferentially partition into the oil phase, stabilizing water droplets dispersed in diesel. According to Bancroft's rule, the continuous phase is the one in which the surfactant is more soluble. When multiple surfactants are used, the effective HLB follows a weighted average: HLBmix = Σ(HLB)iXi. The HLB directly influences droplet size distribution through interfacial tension reduction and steric stabilization mechanisms. Lower HLB surfactants like Span©80 (HLB=4.3) promote smaller water droplets in diesel by effectively reducing oil-water interfacial tension and forming stable interfacial films. The paper states: 'A lower HLB value indicates that the surfactant has a higher lipophilicity, and the resulting emulsions are more likely to be water-in-oil.' Furthermore, 'The Bancroft rule states that the continuous phase is one in which the surfactant is more soluble. Therefore, the affinity of the surfactant to the oil phase is an essential factor in formulating water-in-oil emulsions.' For mixed surfactant systems: 'The HLB of a surfactant mixture can be calculated as a weighted average: HLBmix = Σ(HLB)iXi where HLBi and Xi respectively refer to the HLB value and mass fraction of ith surfactant.'",
