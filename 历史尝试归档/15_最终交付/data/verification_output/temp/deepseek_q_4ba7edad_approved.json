  "question_text": "Why does CO2 hydrate form more readily than CH4 hydrate under similar pressure-temperature conditions, and how do differences in solubility, diffusion, and thermodynamic stability drive this behavior?",
  "standard_answer": "CO2 hydrate forms more readily than CH4 hydrate due to superior CO2 solubility in water, higher diffusion rates, and greater thermodynamic stability. CO2's higher solubility (e.g., ~0.6-0.7 mol% in TBAB solutions at 290 K and 6 MPa) increases its concentration at the water interface, promoting faster nucleation. The diffusion coefficient of CO2 in aqueous phases is also higher, accelerating transport to nucleation sites. Thermodynamically, CO2 hydrate has a lower formation pressure requirement at a given temperature; for instance, at 276 K, CO2 hydrate forms at ~1.8 MPa versus ~3.6 MPa for CH4 hydrate. This stability arises from CO2's larger molecular diameter and stronger guest-host interactions in hydrate cages, leading to a more negative free energy change. Additionally, CO2's dissociation enthalpy is about 20% higher than CH4's, reflecting stronger binding in the hydrate lattice, which further favors CO2 enclathration over CH4 under equivalent conditions.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Due to the greater solubility and diffusion rate of CO2 in liquid water, CO2 forms hydrate more quickly than CH4.",
    "2": "At 276 K, the minimum pressure to generate pure CO2 CH4, N2, and H2 hydrates are about 1.8, 3.6, 22, and 366 MPa, respectively."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains why CO2 hydrate forms more readily than CH4 hydrate. It accurately cites the key mechanisms from the original text: (1) greater CO2 solubility in water, (2) higher diffusion rate, and (3) superior thermodynamic stability. The pressure values at 276 K (1.8 MPa for CO2 vs 3.6 MPa for CH4) match the original text exactly. The additional details about solubility values in TBAB solutions, diffusion coefficients, molecular diameter effects, guest-host interactions, and dissociation enthalpy differences are all consistent with established hydrate science and provide valid mechanistic explanations that extend but do not contradict the original text. The thermodynamic reasoning (lower formation pressure indicating greater stability, more negative free energy change) is sound. No factual errors or logical contradictions detected.",

          "Introduces a specific CO2 solubility figure in TBAB solutions (~0.6–0.7 mol% at 290 K and 6 MPa) that is not supported by the provided ground truth and may be inaccurate or irrelevant to the pure-water comparison."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly attributes faster CO2 hydrate formation to higher solubility, higher diffusion in water, and greater thermodynamic stability, consistent with the ground truth and correctly cites the lower formation pressure for CO2 vs CH4 at 276 K. However, it includes a likely inaccurate quantitative claim about dissociation enthalpy (~20% higher) and an unsupported, possibly irrelevant TBAB solubility example. These factual issues warrant marking the answer as incorrect despite the otherwise sound logic.",
