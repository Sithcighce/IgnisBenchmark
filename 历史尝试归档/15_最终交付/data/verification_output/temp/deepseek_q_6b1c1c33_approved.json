  "question_text": "What physical mechanisms cause current crowding in conventional LED chip designs, and how does this phenomenon lead to localized heating and performance degradation?",
  "standard_answer": "Current crowding arises from the lateral current flow geometry in conventional LED chips where electrodes are arranged on the same surface. The finite resistance of Ohmic contacts and confinement layers creates a non-uniform current density distribution, with current concentrating near electrode edges. This occurs because the path resistance increases with distance from the electrodes, causing carriers to preferentially flow through the lowest resistance paths. The resulting current density can vary dramatically, dropping from ~99 A/cm² near the n-pad to ~11 A/cm² near the p-pad. This localization creates several thermal and performance issues: (1) High local carrier density increases recombination rates, generating concentrated heat that forms hot spots while leaving other regions underutilized. (2) The non-uniform current distribution increases series resistance and promotes electromigration, leading to void formation and reliability issues. (3) Localized overheating accelerates non-radiative recombination processes, further reducing light output efficiency. The problem exacerbates at high power operation where current densities are higher, making thermal management increasingly challenging.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains current crowding mechanisms consistent with the original text. It accurately describes: (1) the lateral current flow geometry causing non-uniform distribution, (2) finite resistance of Ohmic contacts and confinement layers as the root cause, (3) current concentration at electrode edges due to path resistance variations. The answer provides additional valid details about consequences (thermal issues, series resistance, electromigration, efficiency degradation) that are logically sound extensions of the core mechanism. The specific current density values (99 A/cm² to 11 A/cm²) illustrate the non-uniformity quantitatively. All physical principles stated are correct, and the cause-effect relationships are properly established. The answer is more detailed than the original text but contains no factual errors or contradictions.",

The reasoning is sound and aligns with established device physics.
