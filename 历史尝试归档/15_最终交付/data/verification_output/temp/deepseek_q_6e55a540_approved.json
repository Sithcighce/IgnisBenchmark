  "question_text": "How does crosswind affect the flame structure and burning characteristics of pool fires, particularly in terms of flame tilt, base drag, and heat feedback mechanisms?",
  "standard_answer": "Crosswind significantly alters pool fire behavior by modifying the flame structure and combustion dynamics. The wind imposes horizontal momentum that tilts the flame downstream, with increased wind speed causing greater flame tilt (more horizontal orientation) due to the balance between wind-induced forces and buoyancy. This tilted flame geometry changes air entrainment patterns, reducing vertical buoyancy-driven flow. A critical phenomenon under crosswind is flame base drag, where the flame attaches to the downwind pool edge and extends horizontally along the fuel surface, creating a stretched flame zone with enhanced mixing efficiency. The altered flame geometry affects heat feedback distribution: radiation typically decreases due to reduced flame volume facing the fuel surface, while convective heat transfer increases, particularly at the downwind edge where the dragged flame provides direct impingement. The overall burning rate response depends on the complex interplay between improved mixing (which can enhance combustion) and reduced radiative feedback (which can suppress vaporization). These changes in flame structure also modify oscillation behavior and can lead to flame streak formation as the wind disrupts the natural puffing frequency and vortex shedding dynamics in the wake region.",

          "The standard answer uses the term 'flame sag' in one place but 'flame tilt' throughout - the original text mentions 'flame sag' as the distinct behavior, though these may be related phenomena",
          "The answer is quite detailed and elaborates extensively beyond what is stated in the brief original text, but the elaborations appear physically sound"
        ],
        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly identifies the key phenomena mentioned in the original text: flame tilt/sag, flame base drag, and flame streaks. The physical mechanisms described (momentum balance causing flame tilt, enhanced mixing at flame base drag zone, altered heat feedback patterns, modified oscillation behavior) are consistent with established combustion science principles. The answer does not contradict the original text, though it provides much more detail than the brief original excerpt. The terminology 'flame sag' vs 'flame tilt' may refer to the same or closely related phenomena - both describe the flame being pushed from vertical orientation by crosswind. Since the original text is very brief and the answer's elaborations are physically sound and consistent with the mentioned phenomena, I mark this as correct despite the significant difference in detail level.",

It correctly explains how crosswind alters momentum and entrainment, tilting the flame, creating base drag at the downwind edge, and shifting heat feedback from radiation toward increased convective impingement.
