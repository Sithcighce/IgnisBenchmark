  "question_text": "How do catalytic susceptors like Fe and Co nanoparticles influence the morphology and graphitization of carbon nanomaterials during microwave-assisted pyrolysis of biomass, based on the specific experimental findings reported in the literature?",
  "standard_answer": "Catalytic susceptors such as Fe and Co nanoparticles influence the morphology and graphitization of carbon nanomaterials during microwave-assisted pyrolysis through their role as microwave absorbers and catalysts. The experimental findings show that these metallic susceptors lead to the formation of distinct nanostructures: 'incorporation of Fe and Co as susceptors led to the formation of small graphitic flakes and fine nanotubes.' This indicates that both metals promote graphitization, resulting in graphitic carbon structures. Furthermore, the research demonstrates that 'the individual susceptor gives different morphological output,' suggesting that Fe and Co nanoparticles produce different types of nanostructures, though the specific differences in morphology between Fe and Co are not detailed in the provided citations. The microwave pyrolysis technique, enhanced by these metallic susceptors, is described as 'a promising technique to tailor the morphological features of biochar with the used metallic susceptors,' highlighting their ability to customize the nanostructure of the resulting carbon materials. This tailoring occurs through the combined effects of improved microwave absorption, which generates localized heating, and catalytic activity that facilitates carbon rearrangement into graphitic forms during the pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks like sugarcane bagasse.",
