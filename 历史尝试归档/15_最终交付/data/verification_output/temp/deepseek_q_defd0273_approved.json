  "question_text": "How does the applied voltage in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) overcome the thermodynamic barrier for hydrogen production from acetate, and what are the primary sources of voltage losses in practical systems?",
  "standard_answer": "The applied voltage in an MEC overcomes the thermodynamic barrier by providing the necessary energy to drive the non-spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction. For acetate oxidation at the anode (CH3COO⁻ + 4H2O → 2HCO3⁻ + 9H⁺ + 8e⁻), the theoretical anode potential is -0.300 V vs. SHE under standard biological conditions. At the cathode, hydrogen evolution (2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H2) has a theoretical potential of -0.414 V vs. SHE. The equilibrium voltage (Eeq) is calculated as Ecat - Ean = -0.114 V, indicating the reaction is endergonic and requires an external voltage >0.114 V. In practice, applied voltages range from 0.2 to 0.8 V due to significant losses: (1) bacterial metabolic losses at the anode (~0.04 V) from energy dissipation during microbial respiration; (2) activation losses at the cathode (>0.28 V) due to overpotentials for hydrogen evolution on non-ideal catalysts; (3) ohmic losses from electrolyte and electrode resistances; and (4) mass transport losses from concentration gradients. These collective losses necessitate higher applied voltages to achieve practical hydrogen production rates.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The negative Eeq clearly implies that the conversion of remaining acetate to hydrogen is not spontaneous. Thermodynamic limitations thus make dark fermentation less cost-efficient to harvest energy from renewable biomass.",
    "2": "Under operational conditions, the applied voltage (Eap, 0.2–0.8 V in practice) would be larger than Eeq because of voltage or energy losses, mainly arising from bacterial metabolic losses, activation losses, ohmic losses, and mass transport losses in the system."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains how applied voltage overcomes the thermodynamic barrier in MECs. It accurately identifies that the equilibrium voltage (Eeq = -0.114 V) indicates a non-spontaneous reaction requiring external voltage input, which is consistent with the original text stating 'negative Eeq clearly implies that the conversion...is not spontaneous.' The answer provides detailed electrochemical calculations (anode potential -0.300 V, cathode potential -0.414 V vs. SHE) that are standard for acetate oxidation and hydrogen evolution. The four primary sources of voltage losses listed (bacterial metabolic, activation, ohmic, and mass transport losses) directly match those mentioned in the original text. The practical voltage range of 0.2-0.8 V is correctly cited from the original text. While the answer is more detailed than the original text (providing specific potential values and quantitative loss estimates), all statements are factually accurate and consistent with established electrochemical and microbial fuel cell principles. The additional detail enhances understanding without introducing errors.",

The cited practical voltage range (0.2–0.8 V) matches the original text. Added numerical examples are plausible and do not contradict the source.",
