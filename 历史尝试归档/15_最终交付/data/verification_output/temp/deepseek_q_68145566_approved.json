  "question_text": "Explain the mechanism of urea oxidation over Ni catalysts in alkaline media, focusing on why CO₂ removal is the rate-determining step and how it leads to catalyst degradation through nickel carbonate formation.",
  "standard_answer": "Urea oxidation on Ni catalysts in alkaline media proceeds through both indirect and direct mechanisms, with NiOOH as the active site. In the indirect pathway, Ni(OH)₂ is electrooxidized to NiOOH (Ni(OH)₂ + OH⁻ ↔ NiOOH + H₂O + e⁻), which then chemically oxidizes urea to N₂, CO₂, and H₂O. In the direct mechanism, urea adsorbs on NiOOH, forming intermediates that decompose via sequential dehydrogenation and C-N bond cleavage steps. Density functional theory studies reveal that in all reaction paths, the last reaction (CO₂ removal) is the rate-determining step, as clearly supported from the highest free energy and the lowest reaction rate constant as confirmed by other researchers. Moreover, CO₂ is found to be the main reason for the degradation of urea oxidation compared to CO because it reacts with the Ni catalyst to form inactive nickel carbonate. This step involves desorption of CO₂ from the catalyst surface, which is thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically slow, limiting overall oxidation efficiency and causing catalyst degradation through carbonate formation.",

It correctly identifies: (1) NiOOH as the active site with both indirect and direct pathways, (2) CO₂ removal as the rate-determining step supported by highest free energy and lowest reaction rate constant (consistent with original text [1]), and (3) CO₂ as the main cause of catalyst degradation through nickel carbonate formation (consistent with original text [2]). The answer provides additional mechanistic details (electrooxidation equation, dehydrogenation steps, thermodynamic/kinetic explanations) that are scientifically sound and do not contradict the original text. All physical and chemical principles stated are correct, and the cause-effect relationships are properly established.",
