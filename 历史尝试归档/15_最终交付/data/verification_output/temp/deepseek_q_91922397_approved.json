  "question_text": "In wavelength-modulation spectroscopy (WMS) with 1f-normalization, how does large absorbance affect measurement accuracy in combustion diagnostics, and what approaches are suggested to address these challenges according to the provided paper content?",
  "standard_answer": "In WMS with 1f-normalization, large absorbance leads to substantial errors in measurement accuracy, particularly problematic in combustion diagnostics where high-pressure conditions can result in broadened absorption lines and significant absorbance values. The paper specifically identifies '1f-normalization with large absorbance' as a measurement challenge that can cause significant deviations from expected results. When absorbance becomes large, the fundamental assumption of linear response in the WMS-2f/1f signal ratio breaks down, leading to non-linear behavior that distorts the relationship between the measured signal and the target gas properties like concentration and temperature. This is especially critical in high-pressure combustion environments where collisional broadening increases linewidths and can push systems into large absorbance regimes. The paper indicates that these errors motivate the use of more advanced lineshape models that can better account for the complex spectroscopic behavior under such conditions. Additionally, the development of improved, calibration-free WMS models suitable for large modulation depths has been an important advancement, as these methods were first applied to TDLAS sensors for temperature and H2O sensing in internal combustion engines and scramjet combustors where large absorbance conditions are encountered.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and demonstrates sound understanding of WMS spectroscopy principles. It correctly identifies that large absorbance in 1f-normalization leads to substantial errors (directly supported by original text [1]), explains the physical mechanism (breakdown of linear response assumption, non-linear behavior), and appropriately contextualizes this in combustion diagnostics with high-pressure conditions and collisional broadening. The answer correctly states that advanced lineshape models are motivated by these errors (supported by [1]) and accurately references the application to IC-engine and scramjet combustor sensors (supported by [2]). All physical principles regarding WMS, absorbance, and spectroscopic behavior are correctly stated. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions with the original text.",
