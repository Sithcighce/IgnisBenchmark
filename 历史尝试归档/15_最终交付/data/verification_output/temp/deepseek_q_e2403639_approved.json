  "question_text": "How do Bronsted and Lewis acid sites in zeolite catalysts influence the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass, and what are the key reaction pathways they facilitate according to the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "Bronsted and Lewis acid sites in zeolite catalysts play complementary roles in aromatic hydrocarbon formation during catalytic fast pyrolysis. Bronsted acid sites are major active sites for transferring oxygenates into aromatics through cracking and deoxygenation reactions, facilitating the conversion of biomass-derived oxygenates into aromatic precursors. The cooperative effect of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites is prominent during the synthesis of key intermediates like 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural from cellulose and hemicellulose, where Bronsted acid sites play a vital role in the hydrolysis of biomass components to monosaccharides. Lewis acid sites contribute to isomerization reactions, converting aldoses to ketoses, while both acid sites participate in further dehydration steps to form furan derivatives. These reactions collectively build toward aromatic hydrocarbon formation through carbon-carbon coupling and cyclization pathways. The balance between these acid sites is crucial for optimizing aromatic yield while minimizing undesirable side reactions like coke formation.",

However, the answer includes substantial additional mechanistic details (Lewis acid isomerization, carbon-carbon coupling, cyclization, coke formation) that are not present in the provided original text. While these additions appear to be scientifically reasonable and consistent with zeolite catalysis principles, I cannot verify their accuracy against the provided source material.
