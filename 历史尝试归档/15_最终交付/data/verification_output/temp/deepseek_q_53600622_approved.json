  "question_text": "Explain how the octane index (OI) framework accounts for the temperature dependence of fuel autoignition in spark-ignition engines, and discuss why octane sensitivity (S) becomes increasingly important for knock resistance prediction under boosted operating conditions.",
  "standard_answer": "The octane index (OI) extends traditional octane metrics by incorporating the temperature dependence of autoignition chemistry through the equation OI = RON - K × S, where K is an engine-dependent parameter reflecting the pressure-temperature history of the end-gas. Under boosted conditions, higher in-cylinder pressures and temperatures accelerate low-temperature oxidation pathways, making fuels with high octane sensitivity (S = RON - MON) more resistant to knock. The OI framework captures this by weighting S based on the engine's K-factor, which increases with boost pressure, emphasizing the importance of S for accurate knock prediction in downsized, turbocharged engines. This relationship is critical because boosted engines operate at higher loads where knock resistance becomes the limiting factor for efficiency, and fuels with higher octane sensitivity provide superior knock resistance under these elevated pressure-temperature conditions compared to what would be predicted by RON or MON alone.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the OI framework and its relationship to temperature-dependent autoignition chemistry. It correctly states the OI equation (OI = RON - K × S), properly defines octane sensitivity (S = RON - MON), and accurately describes how K increases with boost pressure. The explanation of why high-S fuels are more knock-resistant under boosted conditions is consistent with the original text - higher pressures and temperatures accelerate low-temperature oxidation pathways. The additional context about downsized turbocharged engines and the limitations of RON/MON alone represents valid elaboration that doesn't contradict the original text. All physical principles regarding autoignition chemistry, pressure-temperature effects, and knock resistance are correctly stated.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately restates the OI = RON - K × S formulation and correctly interprets K as reflecting the pressure–temperature history of the end-gas. It correctly explains that boosted conditions increase in-cylinder pressure/temperature and enhance low-temperature oxidation pathways, thereby increasing the importance of octane sensitivity (S) for knock resistance—fully consistent with the provided ground truth. The added point that K increases under boost aligns with the OI framework and does not contradict the original text. No factual or logical errors detected.",

          "The answer incorrectly states that the K-factor 'increases with boost pressure'. For high sensitivity (S) fuels to exhibit higher knock resistance (higher OI) under boosted, low-temperature combustion regimes, the K-factor must be negative. As boost increases and the engine operates further in this regime, K typically *decreases* (becomes more negative), thus amplifying the positive contribution of S."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer contains a significant factual error regarding the trend of the K-factor. The Octane Index is defined as OI = RON - K*S. The answer correctly states that high sensitivity (S) fuels are more knock-resistant under boosted conditions. For a higher S to result in a higher OI (more knock resistance), the term -K*S must be positive, which means K must be negative. As conditions become more severe in the low-temperature regime (e.g., with more boost), the K-factor becomes more negative (decreases), not increases. This error misrepresents how the OI framework models the effect.",
