  "question_text": "Using the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism as described in the provided paper, explain how transition metal nitrides function in electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis and discuss the role of nitrogen vacancies in completing the catalytic cycle. Your explanation should be based strictly on the information provided in the citations.",
  "standard_answer": "According to the provided paper content, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in transition metal nitrides operates through a cyclic process involving surface nitrogen vacancies. The mechanism is described as playing an important role in electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis. The process involves nitrogen vacancies that serve as active sites where nitrogen molecules from the electrolyte can be adsorbed and activated. Specifically, the paper states that 'the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism based on the surface nitrogen vacancies (NVs) was also considered to play an important role' and that 'the N2 molecule from electrolyte can be adsorbed and activated by the NV(s) to complete the catalysis cycle.' This indicates that nitrogen vacancies are crucial for adsorbing and activating nitrogen molecules from the electrolyte, which then allows the catalytic cycle to continue. The mechanism enables continuous operation by regenerating active sites through the vacancy-mediated adsorption and activation process. The citations do not provide detailed information about specific reduction steps of lattice nitrogen atoms or electronic structure effects on selectivity enhancement, so the explanation is limited to the documented role of nitrogen vacancies in adsorbing and activating nitrogen molecules to complete the catalytic cycle.",
