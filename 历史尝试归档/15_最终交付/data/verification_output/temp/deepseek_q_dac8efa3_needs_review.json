  "question_text": "How does atomic layer deposition (ALD) achieve precise control over metal loading and dispersion in single atom catalyst synthesis for energy applications, and what are the specific operational requirements and limitations of this approach according to the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) achieves precise control over metal loading and dispersion through self-limiting gas-surface reactions that deposit metal atoms in a layer-by-layer manner. Each ALD cycle involves alternating exposures of metal precursors and reactants where each precursor pulse saturates the support surface, ensuring uniform coverage. The self-limiting nature prevents multilayer formation and promotes atomic dispersion by relying on chemisorption that terminates once all available sites are occupied. Metal loading can be finely tuned by altering the number of ALD cycles - for example, Pt loading of 2.1 wt% or 7.6 wt% on N-doped graphene nanosheets can be achieved via 50 and 100 ALD cycles respectively, while 150 ALD cycles can increase Pt loading on graphene to 10.5 wt%. However, the ALD process requires ultraclean surfaces and is relatively slow, demanding greater energy consumption. These operational requirements lead to higher fabrication costs, which represents a significant limitation for large-scale production in energy system applications. The method has been successfully applied to synthesize Pt-graphene SACs for methanol oxidation reaction, N-doped graphene supports for hydrogen evolution reactions, and CeO2 supports for CO oxidation, demonstrating its utility in various energy conversion processes.",
