  "question_text": "Calculate the particle relaxation time for a 50 μm water droplet in air at 20°C, given air density ρf = 1.2 kg/m³, air viscosity μf = 1.8×10^-5 Pa·s, water density ρp = 1000 kg/m³, and determine the Stokes number in a turbulent flow with Kolmogorov time scale τη = 0.01 s.",
  "standard_answer": "First, calculate the particle relaxation time in the Stokes regime using tp = (ρp/ρf) × (dp²)/(18νf), where νf = μf/ρf = 1.8×10^-5/1.2 = 1.5×10^-5 m²/s. Substituting the values: tp = (1000/1.2) × (50×10^-6)²/(18×1.5×10^-5) = 833.33 × (2.5×10^-9)/(2.7×10^-4) = 833.33 × 9.26×10^-6 = 7.72×10^-3 s. Now verify the particle Reynolds number assumption: The terminal velocity in Stokes regime is Up∞ = tpg = 7.72×10^-3 × 9.81 = 0.0757 m/s. The particle Reynolds number is Rep = |Ur|dp/νf ≈ 0.0757 × 50×10^-6/1.5×10^-5 = 0.252, which is less than 1, confirming the Stokes regime validity. The Stokes number is St = tp/τη = 7.72×10^-3/0.01 = 0.772. This indicates moderate particle inertia where some preferential concentration effects would be expected, as particles cannot fully follow the smallest turbulent eddies but still respond significantly to fluid motions.",

All calculations are accurate: νf = 1.5×10^-5 m²/s, tp = 7.72×10^-3 s, Rep = 0.252 (confirming Stokes regime validity since Rep < 1), and St = 0.772. The physical interpretation is sound - the Stokes number of 0.772 correctly indicates moderate particle inertia where particles cannot fully follow the smallest turbulent eddies. The verification of the Stokes regime assumption through Reynolds number calculation demonstrates proper understanding of the applicability conditions.
