  "question_text": "Explain the role of sulfation reactions in reducing alkali-induced slagging and corrosion by transforming alkali chlorides into less problematic sulfates, including the kinetic and thermodynamic factors involved.",
  "standard_answer": "Sulfation reactions convert highly corrosive and sticky alkali chlorides (e.g., KCl) into less volatile and less corrosive sulfates (e.g., K2SO4), mitigating slagging and corrosion. Thermodynamically, sulfation is favored in the presence of SO2, O2, and H2O, with reactions like 2KCl(g) + SO2(g) + 1/2O2(g) + H2O(g) ↔ K2SO4(g) + 2HCl(g) driving the transformation. Kinetically, the process is limited by the oxidation of SO2 to SO3, which is slow and temperature-dependent. Below 923 K, sulfation involves gas-solid reactions with low activation energies, while above 923 K, it shifts to gas-liquid reactions due to eutectic mixture formation. The reaction rate is influenced by SO2 concentration and is independent of O2 and H2O at higher temperatures, as adsorption of SO2 on alkali chloride surfaces is rate-limiting. This transformation reduces the concentration of gaseous KCl, decreasing its condensation on surfaces and thus lowering slagging propensity and chloride-induced corrosion.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The sulfation rate is limited by the oxidation of SO2 to SO3. This finding is supported by a recent industrial study conducted by Kassman et al., who reported that the injection of ammonium sulfate, which serves as a source of SO3, is more efficient than the injection of elemental sulfur in promoting KCl sulfation.",
    "2": "Below 923 K, the reactions are essentially controlled by physical adsorption because of low activation energies; however, at around 923 K, they transform from gas–solid reactions to gas–liquid reactions probably because of phase transition from solid to eutectic mixture of potassium chlorides and sulfates."

        "reasoning": "While the answer correctly describes sulfation converting alkali chlorides to sulfates and notes the gas–solid to gas–liquid transition near 923 K due to eutectic formation, it introduces kinetic assertions that contradict the ground truth. Specifically, the rate-limiting step is the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 (not surface adsorption at higher T), and dependence on O2/H2O cannot be dismissed. These errors render the answer incorrect.",

It claims that SO2 adsorption is rate-limiting at higher temperatures, which directly contradicts the original text stating that this control mechanism is dominant below 923 K.
