  "question_text": "Why does the H2/CO electrochemical co-oxidation mechanism in SOFC anodes require careful modeling of competitive adsorption and surface diffusion processes?",
  "standard_answer": "H2/CO electrochemical co-oxidation in SOFC anodes requires careful modeling of competitive adsorption and surface diffusion because both species compete for the same active sites at triple phase boundaries, and their oxidation mechanisms involve different intermediate steps with varying kinetics. Hydrogen typically oxidizes directly through H2 adsorption, dissociation, and reaction with O2- ions, while CO oxidation may proceed through direct electrochemical oxidation or via the water-gas shift reaction followed by H2 oxidation. The competitive adsorption arises because both H2 and CO molecules adsorb on Ni sites, with CO having stronger adsorption affinity that can potentially poison active sites and reduce overall cell performance. Surface diffusion becomes critical because reactants must transport from gas pores to active sites, and the presence of multiple species creates diffusion limitations that affect local concentrations and current distribution. Proper modeling must account for the different electrochemical kinetics (exchange current densities, activation overpotentials), adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Temkin), and surface coverage effects that modify the effective reaction rates. The co-oxidation behavior also depends on operating conditions - at lower temperatures, CO oxidation kinetics become sluggish, while at higher temperatures, both species contribute significantly to current generation, requiring accurate representation of their competitive and synergistic effects on overall cell performance.",

It accurately describes: (1) competition for active sites at triple phase boundaries, (2) the electrochemical oxidation reactions (H2 + O2- → H2O + 2e-, CO + O2- → CO2 + 2e-) consistent with the original text, (3) the water-gas shift reaction pathway, (4) competitive adsorption with CO having stronger affinity, (5) surface diffusion limitations, and (6) temperature-dependent kinetics. The answer provides appropriate elaboration on mechanisms (adsorption isotherms, exchange current densities, surface coverage effects) that are consistent with fundamental SOFC science and the original text's mention of 'surface diffusion and competition absorption' and 'elementary heterogeneous mechanisms'.
