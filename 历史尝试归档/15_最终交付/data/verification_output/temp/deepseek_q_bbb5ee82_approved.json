  "question_text": "Analyze the evolution of coal permeability during underground coal thermal treatment (UCTT) based on the dual-porosity system and pyrolysis-induced changes. Explain the mechanisms driving permeability changes and how these affect mass transport of pyrolysis products.",
  "standard_answer": "Coal permeability during UCTT evolves through two interconnected systems: the natural dual-porosity structure and pyrolysis-induced permeability development. Initially, coal exhibits a dual-porosity system consisting of matrix pores and cleats (natural fractures), where mass transport occurs through diffusion in matrix pores and convection through cleats. As pyrolysis proceeds, heating releases moisture and volatiles, causing significant structural changes. The release of moisture and volatiles during pyrolysis drastically increases permeability due to the creation of additional pore networks and expansion of existing cleats. The naturally occurring pores and cleats can change significantly in the pyrolysis process, creating enhanced pathways for mass transport. Once diffusing out of the matrix pores, gases and liquids form streams in the cleats, facilitating efficient extraction of synthetic fuels. This permeability evolution is crucial for mass transfer as it enables the transport of pyrolysis products from the coal matrix to extraction wells without requiring rubblization, unlike oil shale retorting where low initial permeability necessitates mechanical fracturing. The combined effects of volatile release and structural changes create a self-enhancing permeability system that supports efficient fuel extraction during UCTT operations.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes coal permeability evolution during UCTT and is fully consistent with the original text. It correctly explains: (1) the dual-porosity system with matrix pores and cleats, (2) mass transport mechanisms (diffusion in matrix, convection in cleats), (3) pyrolysis-induced permeability increase due to moisture/volatile release and structural changes, and (4) the formation of gas/liquid streams in cleats. The answer appropriately elaborates on these mechanisms with additional context about extraction efficiency and comparison to oil shale retorting, which are logical extensions that don't contradict the source material. All physical principles regarding mass transport, permeability enhancement, and pyrolysis effects are scientifically sound.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately reflects the dual-porosity framework (diffusion in the matrix, convection in cleats) and the pyrolysis-induced increase in permeability due to release of moisture/volatiles and increased porosity. It correctly notes that gases and liquids, once leaving the matrix, flow in cleats, and that the poreâ€“cleat system can change significantly during pyrolysis. Mechanistic statements are physically sound and consistent with the provided text. The only minor issue is an unnecessary and potentially overgeneralized comparison to oil shale rubblization, which is not required to address the question.",
