  "question_text": "Explain the empirical correlation for surface wavelength (λ_s) in the shear breakup regime of a non-turbulent liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow, including the specific conditions under which this correlation is valid according to the cited literature.",
  "standard_answer": "The empirical correlation for surface wavelength in the shear breakup regime is given by λ_s/d_j = 3.4 We_g^(-0.45), where λ_s is the surface wavelength and d_j is the jet diameter. This correlation was developed based on experimental observations of liquid jet breakup in crossflow conditions. The correlation is specifically valid for gas Weber numbers greater than 4 (We_g > 4), Ohnesorge numbers less than 0.12 (Oh < 0.12), and jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratios in the range of 3 to 8000 (q = 3-8000). The surface wavelength λ_s represents the wavelength of periodic disturbances along the sides of the liquid column where liquid stripping occurs during the breakup process. In the shear breakup regime, which occurs at higher Weber numbers, the surface wavelength becomes significantly smaller than the jet diameter, typically λ_s/d_j < 0.1, indicating the dominance of surface stripping mechanisms over column deformation. The correlation demonstrates that surface wavelength decreases with increasing gas Weber number, reflecting enhanced aerodynamic effects that promote finer-scale surface disturbances and more efficient liquid stripping from the jet surface.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Sallam et al. [29] proposed a correlation as follows: λ_s/d_j = 3.4 We_g^(-0.45); which is valid for 4 < We_g, Oh < 0.12, and q in the range of 3–8000.",
    "2": "Mazallon et al. [28] concluded that these wavelengths are mainly a function of We_g, and there is a clear relationship between λ_c and λ_s and the properties of bag, bag/shear, and shear breakup of a liquid jet in a crossflow."
