  "question_text": "Explain how chlorine and sulfur influence alkali metal mobility and speciation during biomass/coal combustion, focusing on the roles of oxygen-rich versus reducing atmospheres and the transformation between alkali atoms and hydroxides.",
  "standard_answer": "Chlorine and sulfur significantly enhance alkali metal mobility during combustion by facilitating the formation of volatile alkali species. Chlorine increases mobility by promoting alkali release as alkali chlorides, while sulfur facilitates transformation to alkali sulfates. The combustion atmosphere plays a critical role in alkali speciation: in oxygen-rich environments, adequate oxygen can oxidize alkali atoms into alkali hydroxides. Conversely, in reducing atmospheres, the presence of H radicals can reduce alkali hydroxides back into alkali atoms. These transformations affect the fate of alkali metals during combustion, influencing their potential to cause operational problems such as corrosion and deposition. The interplay between chlorine, sulfur, and atmospheric conditions determines whether alkali metals remain as reactive atoms or transform into hydroxide compounds, with important implications for combustion system design and operation.",

It correctly states that: (1) chlorine and sulfur enhance alkali metal mobility by forming volatile alkali chlorides and sulfates; (2) oxygen-rich atmospheres oxidize alkali atoms to alkali hydroxides; (3) reducing atmospheres with H radicals reduce alkali hydroxides back to alkali atoms. The answer appropriately elaborates on the practical implications (corrosion, deposition, system design) without introducing factual errors. The cause-effect relationships are logically sound and consistent with combustion chemistry principles.
