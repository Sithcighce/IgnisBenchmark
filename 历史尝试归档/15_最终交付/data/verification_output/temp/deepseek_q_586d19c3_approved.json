  "question_text": "How do sorption-enhanced reactors mitigate the inhibitory effects of H₂O in CO₂ methanation, and what role do zeolitic materials play in this process according to the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "Sorption-enhanced reactors mitigate the inhibitory effects of H₂O in CO₂ methanation by incorporating adsorbents that remove the produced water during the reaction. This approach reduces the negative effects of water accumulation, which can otherwise inhibit the methanation process. Zeolitic materials serve as effective water sorbents in these systems due to their selective water adsorption capabilities. Specifically, zeolites Y, 13X, and 5A have been reported to enhance water sorption during CO₂ methanation, leading to comparable performance outcomes. The paper states: 'the sorption-enhanced reactor has gained attention as a promising concept. Accordingly, the catalyst support or some additive sorbents can adsorb the produced H₂O during methanation, which can reduce the negative effects of water' and 'Utilization of zeolites Y, 13X and 5A has been reported to enhance water sorption during CO₂ methanation resulting in comparable performance.' These citations confirm that zeolites function as water adsorbents in sorption-enhanced reactors, directly addressing water inhibition without extrapolating to unsupported mechanisms like Le Chatelier's principle application or specific regeneration methods.",

It correctly identifies zeolitic materials (Y, 13X, and 5A) as effective water sorbents and directly quotes the original text to support these claims. The answer appropriately notes that it does not extrapolate to unsupported mechanisms like Le Chatelier's principle or specific regeneration methods, staying faithful to what the original text states. All factual statements align with the provided original text, the logical flow is sound (water removal reduces inhibition), and the core mechanisms are properly explained. The answer is detailed but contains no errors.",
