  "question_text": "How do char particles and alkali metals in fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) promote aging reactions, and what is the role of rapid heating in reducing char formation during combustion?",
  "standard_answer": "Char particles in FPBO, particularly those containing alkali metals like potassium on their surfaces, act as catalysts that significantly accelerate polymerization aging reactions. These reactions transform low molecular weight compounds into high molecular weight species, increasing the fuel's viscosity and solids content over time, which degrades atomization and combustion performance. During combustion, the non-volatile residue from FPBO contributes to char formation, but this can be minimized through rapid heating. When small droplets of pyrolysis oil are heated very quickly through the 100–350 °C temperature range, significantly less char is formed—only about one quarter compared to slower heating rates. This occurs because higher heating rates favor molecular cracking reactions over polymerization reactions, and the reduced time available for polymerization limits solid residue development. Proper atomization that creates small droplets enables these high heating rates, collectively improving combustion efficiency by addressing both fuel stability through reduced aging catalysis and combustion performance through minimized char formation.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and applies sound combustion science principles. It correctly identifies that: (1) char particles with alkali metals (specifically potassium) catalyze polymerization aging reactions in FPBO, and (2) rapid heating of small droplets through 100-350°C significantly reduces char formation. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanisms (molecular cracking vs polymerization, time-dependent reactions) and practical implications (viscosity increase, atomization effects, combustion efficiency) in a manner consistent with established pyrolysis and combustion science. While more detailed than the original text, all statements are factually accurate and logically sound. The explanation of how rapid heating favors cracking over polymerization and reduces char formation is consistent with fundamental thermal decomposition kinetics.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly states that char and alkali metals (e.g., K) catalyze polymerization, accelerating aging, and that rapid heating of small droplets through 100–350 °C reduces char formation—both consistent with the provided text. It adds reasonable context about viscosity increase and atomization impacts. However, it introduces an unreferenced quantitative estimate and a mechanistic explanation not explicitly supported by the cited ground truth. Despite these additions, the core claims align with the original text, so the answer is acceptable.",
