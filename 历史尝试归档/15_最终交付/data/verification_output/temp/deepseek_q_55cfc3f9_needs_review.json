  "question_text": "A mixed electronic and carbonate-ionic conductor (MECC) membrane with thickness L = 1 mm operates at T = 900 K. Given σ₀ = 0.5 S cm⁻¹, porosity ε = 0.4, tortuosity τ_p = 2.5, feed-side partial pressures p_CO₂_feed = 0.5 atm and p_O₂_feed = 0.2 atm, and sweep-side partial pressures p_CO₂_sweep = 0.1 atm and p_O₂_sweep = 0.05 atm, calculate the CO₂ permeation flux J_CO₂ using the simplified flux equation for MECC membranes. Show all derivation steps, unit conversions, and explain how the membrane microstructure (ε, τ_p) and operating conditions (T, p_i) influence the flux.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate the CO₂ permeation flux for the MECC membrane, we use the simplified flux equation from the paper: J_CO₂ = (3RT / 8F²L) * (ε/τ_p) * σ₀ * [(p_CO₂_feed * p_O₂_feed^(1/2)) - (p_CO₂_sweep * p_O₂_sweep^(1/2))]. First, convert units: L = 1 mm = 0.001 m, T = 900 K, R = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹, F = 96485 C mol⁻¹. Calculate the pre-factor: 3RT / 8F²L = (3 * 8.314 * 900) / (8 * (96485)² * 0.001) = 22458 / (8 * 9.31e9 * 0.001) = 22458 / 7.448e7 ≈ 3.015e-4 mol m⁻² s⁻¹ Pa⁻¹. Now compute the pressure terms: p_CO₂_feed * p_O₂_feed^(1/2) = 0.5 * (0.2)^(0.5) = 0.5 * 0.4472 ≈ 0.2236 atm; p_CO₂_sweep * p_O₂_sweep^(1/2) = 0.1 * (0.05)^(0.5) = 0.1 * 0.2236 ≈ 0.02236 atm. Difference = 0.2236 - 0.02236 = 0.20124 atm. Convert atm to Pa: 0.20124 atm * 101325 Pa/atm ≈ 20390 Pa. Multiply all terms: J_CO₂ = 3.015e-4 * (0.4/2.5) * 0.5 * 20390 = 3.015e-4 * 0.16 * 0.5 * 20390 = 3.015e-4 * 0.08 * 20390 = 3.015e-4 * 1631.2 ≈ 0.492 mol m⁻² s⁻¹. The flux depends on temperature (higher T increases pre-factor), microstructure (higher ε/τ_p enhances carbonate-ion transport), and partial pressures (driving force from p_CO₂ p_O₂^(1/2) difference).",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the MECC flux equation from the original text. All calculation steps are accurate: (1) Unit conversions are correct (L=0.001m, constants properly stated), (2) Pre-factor calculation: 3RT/8F²L = 22458/7.448e7 ≈ 3.015e-4 is correct, (3) Pressure term calculations are accurate (0.2236 atm feed side, 0.02236 atm sweep side, difference 0.20124 atm ≈ 20390 Pa), (4) Final flux calculation: 3.015e-4 × 0.16 × 0.5 × 20390 ≈ 0.492 mol m⁻² s⁻¹ is mathematically sound. The physical interpretation correctly identifies that flux depends on temperature (increases pre-factor), microstructure (ε/τ_p enhances carbonate-ion transport), and partial pressure driving force, all consistent with the original equation and the linear relationship mentioned in the original text. No factual errors or logical contradictions detected.",
