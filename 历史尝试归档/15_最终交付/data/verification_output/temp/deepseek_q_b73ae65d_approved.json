  "question_text": "How does the spatial distribution of CO adsorption evolve along PEMFC anode flow channels, and what transport mechanisms (advection vs. diffusion) govern the observed distribution patterns under different flow conditions?",
  "standard_answer": "The spatial distribution of CO adsorption in PEMFC anode flow channels exhibits significant heterogeneity due to competing transport mechanisms. Advection dominates along the channel direction, creating higher CO coverage at the inlet where fresh CO-rich gas first contacts the catalyst surface. Lateral diffusion through the porous electrode structure distributes CO perpendicular to the flow direction, but this transport is slower than advection. The interaction between these two mechanisms creates distinct distribution patterns depending on flow conditions. At low flow rates, diffusion creates anisotropic distributions of CO away from the channel, resulting in non-uniform coverage across the electrode. Higher flows produce more uniform distributions due to enhanced convective mixing that overcomes the limitations of lateral diffusion. Under galvanostatic control and in the absence of self-sustained potential oscillations, the distribution of surface coverage by CO is uneven as the adsorption of CO is faster at the inlet than at the outlet. The dispersion of CO along the channel is fundamentally a result of the competition between advection along the channel and lateral diffusion through the electrode structure, with the relative dominance of each mechanism determining the final poisoning pattern observed in segmented cell studies.",

The answer provides additional correct elaboration (e.g., explaining why advection creates higher inlet coverage, why diffusion is slower than advection) that is consistent with fundamental transport phenomena in PEMFCs.

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the ground-truth points: competition between advection along the channel and lateral diffusion through the electrode governs CO dispersion; low flow yields anisotropic, non-uniform coverage, while higher flow leads to more uniform distributions; and under galvanostatic control without oscillations, inlet coverage is higher due to faster adsorption. The added explanations are consistent and physically reasonable, with only a minor overgeneralization about relative transport rates.",
