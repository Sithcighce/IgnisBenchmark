  "standard_answer": "Ozone enhances combustion through two distinct chemical pathways with different temperature requirements and radical production mechanisms. Ozone decomposition (O₃ + M → O₂ + O + M) requires elevated temperatures to release atomic oxygen, typically occurring in the preheat zone of flames. This atomic oxygen then initiates fuel oxidation reactions, accelerating the overall combustion process. In contrast, ozonolysis reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes) are rapid even at room temperature due to the cycloaddition mechanism where ozone forms a primary ozonide that decomposes into a carbonyl compound and an excited Criegee intermediate. While the direct reactions between O₃ and alkanes is immeasurably slow and therefore of little importance in many systems, reactions of alkenes with O₃ can be fast. The decomposition of POZ produces a Criegee intermediate (a carbonyl oxide) and a carbonyl compound. The Criegee intermediate is in an excited state. These ozonolysis pathways initiate low-temperature fuel reactions directly, bypassing the need for thermal initiation. In low-temperature combustion systems like HCCI engines, ozone addition provides early radical supply that reduces cool flame onset temperature and advances ignition timing. The combination of both mechanisms—high-temperature atomic oxygen production from decomposition and low-temperature direct fuel oxidation from ozonolysis—makes ozone particularly effective for combustion enhancement across different temperature regimes.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the fundamental differences between ozone decomposition and ozonolysis reactions. It accurately describes: (1) thermal decomposition of O₃ producing atomic oxygen at elevated temperatures, (2) ozonolysis of alkenes proceeding rapidly at low temperatures via cycloaddition mechanism forming primary ozonide (POZ), (3) POZ decomposition producing excited Criegee intermediates and carbonyl compounds, and (4) the statement that O₃-alkane reactions are immeasurably slow while O₃-alkene reactions are fast. All statements are consistent with the original text and established combustion chemistry principles. The answer appropriately addresses temperature requirements, radical production mechanisms, and implications for low-temperature combustion systems as requested in the question.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly distinguishes ozone thermal decomposition (producing atomic O at elevated temperatures, e.g., flame preheat zones) from ozonolysis of alkenes (fast at room temperature forming a primary ozonide that decomposes into a carbonyl and an excited Criegee intermediate). It aligns with the ground-truth statements that O3–alkane reactions are negligible and that ozonolysis yields an excited Criegee intermediate. The implications for low-temperature combustion (early radical supply, advancing ignition) are consistent with established combustion behavior. No factual or logical errors detected.",
