  "question_text": "Why does the thermal conductivity of molten salts present significant measurement challenges, and how do radiation and convection effects introduce systematic errors in steady-state methods?",
  "standard_answer": "Molten salt thermal conductivity measurement faces multiple challenges: the samples are electrically conductive, corrosive liquids at high temperatures where radiation heat transfer becomes significant. In steady-state methods, radiation contributes additional heat flux that is misinterpreted as conductive transport, overestimating thermal conductivity. Convection currents in the liquid sample create non-uniform temperature distributions and additional heat transfer pathways not accounted for in the Fourier conduction model. The sample thickness control is problematic due to salt creeping and thermal expansion effects, and since thermal conductivity calculation depends linearly on thickness (k = Q·d/(A·ΔT)), small dimensional uncertainties create large errors. Molten salts typically have low thermal conductivity (~0.5 W/m·K), making accurate measurement difficult as parasitic heat losses become significant relative to the measured conductive flux. Transient methods like laser flash analysis partially mitigate these issues but introduce other complexities in handling liquid samples at high temperatures.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the measurement challenges for molten salt thermal conductivity and is consistent with the original text. It accurately describes how radiation and convection introduce systematic errors in steady-state methods: radiation adds heat flux misinterpreted as conduction (overestimating k), and convection creates non-uniform temperature distributions violating the Fourier conduction model. The answer provides additional valid technical details (electrical conductivity, corrosiveness, sample thickness control issues, low k values ~0.5 W/m·K, transient method alternatives) that are physically sound and enhance understanding without contradicting the original text. All physical principles stated are correct, including the linear relationship k = Q·d/(A·ΔT) and the significance of parasitic heat losses for low-conductivity materials. The answer appropriately addresses both parts of the question.",
