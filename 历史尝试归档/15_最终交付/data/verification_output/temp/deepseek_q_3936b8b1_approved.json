  "question_text": "In zinc-air batteries, how does the continuous precipitation of ZnO lead to dendrite formation and eventual short-circuit, and what role does hydrogen evolution from zinc corrosion play in increasing internal pressure during cycling?",
  "standard_answer": "In zinc-air batteries, the continuous precipitation of ZnO during cycling leads to the formation and growth of dendrites. These dendrites are formed as zinc undergoes dissolution and precipitation cycles during battery operation. As the ZnO dendrites grow, they can eventually extend far enough to physically contact the positive electrode, creating a direct electrical connection between the electrodes. This results in an internal short-circuit that compromises battery performance and safety. Additionally, hydrogen evolution caused by the corrosion of zinc represents another significant drawback. This gas evolution leads to increased pressure within the battery during cycling, which can cause mechanical stress on battery components and potentially lead to safety hazards if not properly managed. Both dendrite formation and hydrogen gas evolution contribute to the degradation of battery performance over multiple cycles.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The continuous precipitation of ZnO forms and grows a dendrite, that eventually touches the positive electrode, which results in a short-circuit.",
    "2": "In addition to Zn's precipitation problem, the evolution of hydrogen (H2) gas, caused by the corrosion of Zn, is also a major drawback, resulting in an increased pressure in the battery during cycling."
