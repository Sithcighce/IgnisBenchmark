  "question_text": "How do the structural differences in methoxyl group substitution among H, G, and S lignin units influence their thermal decomposition behavior and product distribution during pyrolysis, and what experimental evidence supports these differences?",
  "standard_answer": "The structural differences in methoxyl group substitution significantly influence lignin pyrolysis behavior and product distribution. H units lack methoxyl groups, G units have one methoxyl group, and S units have two methoxyl groups on their aromatic rings. These differences affect thermal stability and product selectivity. Experimental studies using Py-GC/MS show that softwood lignin (dominated by G units) produces more guaiacol derivatives due to the single methoxyl group facilitating specific cleavage pathways. Hardwood lignin (mixture of G and S units) generates syringol derivatives from S units, where the two methoxyl groups create steric hindrance that influences bond cleavage preferences. Grass lignin (containing H, G, and S units) exhibits intermediate behavior with products reflecting all three unit types. The methoxyl content correlates with decomposition temperature, with higher methoxylation generally leading to lower thermal stability due to electron-donating effects that weaken certain bonds. Citation 1 confirms the fundamental structural difference: 'The H, G and S units have none, one and two methoxyl groups, respectively.' Citation 2 provides biomass-specific evidence: 'Softwood lignin has a high content of guaiacyl units, hardwood lignin presents a mixture of guaiacyl and syringyl units, and grass lignin contains a mixture of all three units.' These structural variations directly impact the pyrolysis mechanism through differences in bond dissociation energies and radical stabilization during thermal decomposition.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains the structural differences among H, G, and S lignin units (0, 1, and 2 methoxyl groups respectively) as stated in Citation 1. It accurately describes the biomass-specific lignin compositions (softwood=G-rich, hardwood=G+S mixture, grass=all three units) consistent with Citation 2. The mechanistic explanations about pyrolysis behavior, product distribution (guaiacol vs syringol derivatives), and the influence of methoxyl groups on thermal stability are scientifically sound and logically consistent with established combustion and thermophysics principles. The answer appropriately uses the citations to support its claims and provides reasonable elaboration on mechanisms (bond dissociation energies, steric effects, electron-donating effects) that are consistent with fundamental organic chemistry and thermal decomposition theory. While the answer is detailed, all statements are accurate and no factual errors or logical contradictions are present.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly states the methoxylation levels of H/G/S units and the typical unit composition of softwood, hardwood, and grasses, matching the ground-truth statements. It accurately links methoxyl substitution to pyrolysis product distributions (guaiacol from G, syringol from S) and cites Py-GC/MS as experimental evidence, which is standard in the literature. The mechanistic rationale (electron-donating methoxy groups, steric effects in S units reducing condensation and influencing cleavage pathways) and the general trend of higher methoxylation correlating with lower thermal stability are consistent with established findings.

        "reasoning": "The answer is factually and logically correct. It accurately describes the structural differences in H, G, and S lignin units (methoxyl group count), consistent with Citation 1. It correctly links these units to different biomass types (softwood, hardwood, grass) and their characteristic pyrolysis products (guaiacols, syringols), which is consistent with Citation 2 and standard experimental findings (Py-GC/MS). The explanation that higher methoxylation leads to lower thermal stability due to electron-donating effects weakening ether bonds is a sound and accepted principle in lignin pyrolysis.
