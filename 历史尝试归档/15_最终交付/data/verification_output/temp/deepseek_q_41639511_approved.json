  "question_text": "How does the Biot number influence the selection of thermal state metrics and the design of battery thermal management systems?",
  "standard_answer": "The Biot number (Bi = hL/k) quantitatively determines the relative importance of internal conduction versus external convection in battery heat transfer, directly guiding metric selection and BTMS design. When Bi << 0.1, internal thermal resistance is negligible compared to surface convection, resulting in uniform temperature distribution; thus, surface temperature suffices for monitoring, and passive cooling may be adequate. When Bi > 0.1, significant internal gradients exist, necessitating core temperature or distribution monitoring to capture peak temperatures. For BTMS design, low Bi scenarios allow simpler, cost-effective solutions like natural convection, while high Bi conditions require active cooling (e.g., forced air/liquid) to enhance h and reduce Bi, or anisotropic material optimization to increase k. In large-format cells with low k⊥, Bi often exceeds 0.1, mandating distributed temperature sensing and advanced cooling strategies to mitigate hotspots and ensure safety during high-rate operations like extreme fast charging.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "If the Biot number of the cell is sufficiently small (i.e., Bi = hL/k≪0.1, where h is the heat transfer coefficient, L is the characteristic length of the cell, and k denotes the thermal conductivity of the cell), the heat conduction inside the cell is much faster than the heat convection at the surface.",
    "2": "For cylindrical batteries under forced convection cooling conditions or with a larger radius, the Biot number could be larger than 0.1 so that the temperature at the battery center could be significantly higher than that at the surface."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the influence of Biot number on thermal state metrics and BTMS design. It accurately states that Bi = hL/k and correctly interprets the physical meaning: when Bi << 0.1, internal conduction dominates over surface convection leading to uniform temperature (consistent with original text [1]); when Bi > 0.1, significant internal gradients exist requiring core temperature monitoring (consistent with original text [2]). The design implications (passive vs active cooling, material optimization) follow logically from these principles. The answer appropriately applies these concepts to battery systems, particularly large-format cells. All physical relationships and cause-effect logic are sound and consistent with the original text.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly relates small Bi to near-uniform internal temperature and large Bi to significant internal gradients, consistent with the ground truth. However, it contains a key factual error: claiming that enhancing h reduces Bi. Since Bi = hL/k, increasing h increases Bi, not decreases it. While other points (monitoring core temperature for high Bi, anisotropy effects, and distributed sensing for large cells) are sound, the incorrect h–Bi relationship warrants marking the answer as incorrect.",

          "The statement 'enhance h and reduce Bi' contains a minor imprecision. While increasing thermal conductivity 'k' does reduce the Biot number, enhancing the heat transfer coefficient 'h' (e.g., via active cooling) actually increases the Biot number (Bi = hL/k). The primary goal of enhancing 'h' is to lower the overall cell temperature, not necessarily to reduce Bi. This nuance does not invalidate the correctness of the recommended BTMS strategies."
