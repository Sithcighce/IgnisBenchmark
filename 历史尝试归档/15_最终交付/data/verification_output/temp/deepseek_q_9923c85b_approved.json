  "question_text": "Why does the phase of the flame transfer function become fixed to multiples of π at marginal stability in systems with fully reflecting boundary conditions, and how does this constrain the oscillation frequency?",
  "standard_answer": "In systems with fully reflecting boundary conditions (e.g., closed inlet and open outlet), the jump conditions and acoustic wave propagation impose a real-valued constraint on the flame response at marginal stability (σ = 0). The combined equations from momentum and energy conservation across the flame and boundaries lead to the relation 1 + θF(ω) = (ξ/α) cot(φ₂) cot(φ₀ + φₑ + φ₁), where the right-hand side is purely real. Since F(ω) = |F(ω)|e^(iφ), this necessitates that the phase φ must be an integer multiple of π (φ = -kπ for k ∈ N₀) to ensure the left-hand side is also real. Consequently, the oscillation frequency ω is determined solely by the phase condition φ(ω) = -kπ, which for an n-τ model F(s) = ne^(-iωτ) implies ω = kπ/τ. This phase locking occurs because the acoustic field's symmetry under full reflection forces the heat release fluctuations to be in phase or anti-phase with velocity perturbations, eliminating imaginary components in the stability criterion.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Note that the right-hand side of Eq. (51) is real valued. Accordingly, the frequency response F(ω) = |F(ω)|e^(iφ) must be also real, which in turn makes necessary the condition φ = -kπ for k ∈ N₀.",
    "2": "This observation has been recently made in Yong et al. [20] for a duct configuration, where αc = α = 1. Mukherjee and Shrira [41] arrived at an equivalent formulation to the one of [20]."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the phase-locking mechanism at marginal stability. It accurately states that the right-hand side of the governing equation is real-valued, which necessitates that F(ω) must also be real, requiring φ = -kπ for k ∈ N₀. This is consistent with the original text from Eq. (51). The answer provides appropriate physical context about fully reflecting boundary conditions, jump conditions, and acoustic wave propagation. The explanation of how this constrains oscillation frequency (ω = kπ/τ for an n-τ model) is logically sound. The physical interpretation about phase locking due to acoustic field symmetry is correct and adds helpful context without contradicting the original text. All factual statements align with established thermoacoustic stability theory.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly identifies that, at marginal stability, the governing relation becomes real-valued, which forces the flame transfer function to be real and thus fixes its phase to integer multiples of π. This directly matches the ground-truth statement. It also correctly explains that this imposes a phase-only frequency selection, and for an n–τ model yields ω = kπ/τ. The added physical explanation about symmetry and elimination of imaginary components is consistent. Minor unverified specifics do not contradict the core, which aligns with the provided PECS text.",
