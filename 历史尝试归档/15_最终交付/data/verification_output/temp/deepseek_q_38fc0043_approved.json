  "question_text": "How does the position of the C=C double bond in hexene isomers (1-, 2-, and 3-hexene) influence their low-temperature reactivity and the presence of negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior?",
  "standard_answer": "The position of the C=C double bond significantly affects low-temperature reactivity by altering the availability of alkyl chain sites for O2 addition and subsequent chain-branching pathways. In 1-hexene, the terminal double bond leaves a longer alkyl chain (C5H11) that undergoes conventional low-temperature oxidation: alkyl radicals (R) add O2 to form ROO, which isomerizes to QOOH radicals. These QOOH species can further add O2, leading to chain-branching via ketohydroperoxide decomposition that produces OH radicals, enhancing reactivity and exhibiting NTC behavior. In contrast, 3-hexene has the double bond centrally located, resulting in shorter alkyl fragments (e.g., C3H7) that favor decomposition or termination pathways over chain-branching, suppressing NTC. 2-hexene shows intermediate behavior due to mixed chain lengths. The paper notes: 'For 3-hexene, they found the ignition behavior to be dominated by the properties of the double bond, whereas for 1-hexene, reactivity is dominated by the properties of the alkenyl chain.' and '1-hexene behaved similar to alkanes and showed NTC behavior, while 3-hexene exhibited negligible NTC behavior.' This mechanistic difference arises because longer alkyl chains in 1-hexene facilitate multi-step O2 additions and isomerizations that are crucial for low-temperature chain-branching, while central double bonds promote resonance stabilization or direct decomposition, reducing reactivity.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains how double bond position affects low-temperature reactivity and NTC behavior in hexene isomers. It accurately states that 1-hexene shows NTC behavior similar to alkanes due to its longer alkyl chain enabling conventional low-temperature oxidation pathways (R→ROO→QOOH→chain-branching), while 3-hexene exhibits negligible NTC because the central double bond creates shorter alkyl fragments that favor decomposition over chain-branching. The answer directly quotes the original text and provides mechanistically sound explanations consistent with established combustion chemistry principles. The detailed mechanistic description (O2 addition, isomerization, ketohydroperoxide decomposition) is accurate and enhances understanding without introducing errors. All factual statements align with the original text and combustion science fundamentals.",

However, it contains factual errors in the stated alkyl substituent sizes (C5H11 vs. correct C4H9 for 1-hexene; C3H7 vs. correct C2H5 for 3-hexene). These structural inaccuracies warrant marking the answer as incorrect despite generally sound mechanistic reasoning.",
