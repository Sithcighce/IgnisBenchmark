  "question_text": "How does carbon accumulation on nickel-based catalysts in methane pyrolysis affect catalyst deactivation, heat transfer, and reactor performance according to the provided research?",
  "standard_answer": "Carbon accumulation on nickel-based catalysts in methane pyrolysis leads to catalyst deactivation by covering the active sites, which progressively interrupts the methane decomposition reaction and causes a decline in hydrogen yield. This deposition of solid carbon also results in a decline in heat transfer efficiency within the reactor system. Additionally, the carbon buildup causes reactor clogging, which disrupts continuous operation and requires periodic maintenance or regeneration. These combined effects significantly impact overall reactor performance by reducing catalytic activity, compromising thermal management, and creating operational challenges that affect process reliability and efficiency.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Nickel-based catalysts, in particular, suffer from rapid deactivation due to carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface [120â€“122].",
    "2": "The deposition of solid carbon on the active sites of the catalysts and within the reactor results in catalyst deactivation [123], decline in heat transfer [124], as well as reactor clogging [102,125]."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key points from the original text. It correctly identifies three main effects of carbon accumulation: (1) catalyst deactivation through active site coverage leading to reduced hydrogen yield, (2) decline in heat transfer efficiency, and (3) reactor clogging requiring maintenance. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanisms (e.g., 'covering active sites' explains how deactivation occurs, 'disrupts continuous operation' explains the consequence of clogging) while remaining factually consistent with the original text. The cause-effect relationships are logically sound and align with established principles in catalysis and reactor engineering. No contradictions or factual errors detected.",

The mention of declining hydrogen yield and maintenance/regeneration needs are reasonable implications of deactivation and clogging and do not contradict the original text.",
