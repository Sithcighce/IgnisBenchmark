  "question_text": "What is the Rayleigh criterion for thermoacoustic instability, and how does the spatial distribution of unsteady heat release relative to pressure oscillations determine stability in non-compact flames?",
  "standard_answer": "The Rayleigh criterion states that thermoacoustic oscillations are self-excited when the net energy added to the acoustic field by unsteady heat release over an acoustic cycle is positive. Mathematically, this requires the volume integral of the product of pressure and heat release rate oscillations to be greater than zero over a cycle: ∫∫∫ p₁(x,t)q̇₁(x,t) dV dt > 0. Physically, this means heat release must occur when pressure is high (in phase within ±90°) to do work on the gas through dilatation. For acoustically compact flames (dimensions ≪ acoustic wavelength), only the spatially integrated heat release matters. However, for non-compact flames, the spatial distribution becomes critical because local regions can add energy while others remove it. The relative phase between local heat release and pressure oscillations varies spatially due to wave propagation effects. Regions where heat release leads pressure by 0-90° add energy, while those lagging by 90-180° remove energy. The net instability depends on the integral over the flame volume. This explains why flame shape and position relative to pressure nodes/antinodes significantly influence stability boundaries in transverse modes, where the pressure field has strong spatial variations.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "A necessary condition for the oscillations to be self-excited is that net energy must be added to the acoustic disturbance field by the heat release. It can be shown that this occurs when the phase of the heat release rate and pressure oscillations is within ±90°, i.e., the 'Rayleigh criterion'.",
    "2": "In contrast, the spatial distribution of the unsteady heat release is very important in non-compact flames, as it is the relative phase of the local heat release and pressure that controls the value of the Rayleigh integral."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the Rayleigh criterion and its application to non-compact flames. It accurately states that thermoacoustic instability occurs when the integral of pressure and heat release rate oscillations is positive over a cycle, consistent with the original text's requirement that heat release and pressure be within ±90° phase. The answer correctly distinguishes between compact flames (where only spatially integrated heat release matters) and non-compact flames (where spatial distribution is critical due to varying local phase relationships). The explanation that regions with 0-90° phase lead add energy while 90-180° lag regions remove energy is physically sound and consistent with the Rayleigh criterion. The mathematical formulation and physical interpretation align with the original text's statements about phase requirements and the importance of spatial distribution in non-compact flames. The answer provides appropriate elaboration without introducing factual errors or contradictions.",
