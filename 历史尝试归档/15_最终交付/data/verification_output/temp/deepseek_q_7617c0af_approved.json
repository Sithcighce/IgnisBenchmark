  "question_text": "Calculate the lower heating value (LHV) on both mass and volumetric bases for a gasoline surrogate containing 60% isooctane, 30% toluene, and 10% n-heptane by volume, given their individual LHVs and densities. Explain why volumetric energy density is more relevant for vehicle fuel economy.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate the composite LHV, we use the typical values: isooctane LHV = 44.3 MJ/kg, density = 0.692 g/cm³; toluene LHV = 40.5 MJ/kg, density = 0.867 g/cm³; n-heptane LHV = 44.6 MJ/kg, density = 0.684 g/cm³. First, convert volume fractions to mass fractions. The mass of each component per unit volume: isooctane = 0.60 × 0.692 = 0.415 g/cm³, toluene = 0.30 × 0.867 = 0.260 g/cm³, n-heptane = 0.10 × 0.684 = 0.068 g/cm³. Total mass = 0.743 g/cm³. Mass fractions: isooctane = 0.415/0.743 = 0.558, toluene = 0.260/0.743 = 0.350, n-heptane = 0.068/0.743 = 0.092. Mass-based LHV = (0.558 × 44.3) + (0.350 × 40.5) + (0.092 × 44.6) = 24.72 + 14.18 + 4.10 = 43.0 MJ/kg. Volumetric LHV = mass-based LHV × density = 43.0 MJ/kg × 0.743 g/cm³ × (1000 cm³/L) × (1 kg/1000 g) = 31.95 MJ/L. Volumetric energy density is more relevant for fuel economy because vehicles are refueled by volume (liters), and distance traveled per tank is directly proportional to the energy content per liter. Lower volumetric energy density (e.g., from oxygenated additives) reduces range unless compensated by higher efficiency.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Gasoline fuels are typically sold on a per unit volume basis, so it is often useful to understand the amount of energy per unit volume (e.g., MJ/L).",
    "2": "This has an impact on vehicle fuel economy, which is measured in units of L/100 km (or miles per gallon), because distance travelled per unit of fuel is directly related to the volumetric energy density of the fuel."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly performs the LHV calculation using proper methodology: (1) converts volume fractions to mass fractions using component densities, (2) calculates mass-based LHV using weighted average, (3) converts to volumetric LHV by multiplying by mixture density. The numerical calculations are accurate (mass-based LHV = 43.0 MJ/kg, volumetric LHV = 31.95 MJ/L). The explanation of why volumetric energy density is more relevant for fuel economy is consistent with the original text, correctly stating that vehicles are refueled by volume and that distance traveled per tank is directly proportional to energy content per liter. The additional context about oxygenated additives is a reasonable extension that doesn't contradict the original text. All physical principles and calculations are sound.",
