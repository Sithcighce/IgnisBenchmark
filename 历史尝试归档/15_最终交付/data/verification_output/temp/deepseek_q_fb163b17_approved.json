  "question_text": "In post-combustion CO₂ capture using MOFs, how do temperature swing adsorption (TSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) cycles optimize working capacity and what are the key regeneration requirements?",
  "standard_answer": "Temperature swing adsorption (TSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) cycles optimize working capacity in post-combustion CO₂ capture by exploiting different regeneration mechanisms. TSA operates by adsorbing CO₂ at flue gas conditions (typically 40-60°C) where MOFs exhibit high adsorption capacity due to favorable thermodynamics, then regenerating the adsorbent by increasing temperature. According to the paper, 'To achieve working capacities (defined as the difference between CO₂ uptake capacity of MOFs at feed condition and desorption condition at the end of purge step) comparable to the amine process, the MOF must be heated to around 200 °C.' This thermal regeneration releases CO₂ by reducing adsorption affinity at elevated temperatures. PSA, in contrast, uses pressure variations where adsorption occurs at flue gas pressure (approximately 1 bar) and regeneration is achieved by pressure reduction. The paper describes that 'PSA is also run in a four-steps cycle, i.e. adsorption of a target gas from gas mixture stream, co-current blow-down of gas using vacuum pump, counter-current evacuation of the column from the free-end, and light product pressurization with the help of outlet stream from the adsorption step.' The key trade-off involves TSA requiring significant thermal energy for heating to 200°C versus PSA requiring mechanical energy for vacuum pumping and compression operations.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes both TSA and PSA mechanisms for CO₂ capture using MOFs. It correctly states that TSA requires heating to around 200°C for regeneration (directly quoted from original text [1]) and accurately describes the four-step PSA cycle (consistent with original text [2]). The answer properly explains the fundamental difference between thermal regeneration (TSA) and pressure-based regeneration (PSA), including typical operating conditions (40-60°C flue gas temperature, ~1 bar pressure). The thermodynamic principles are correctly stated - TSA exploits temperature-dependent adsorption affinity while PSA uses pressure variations. The trade-off between thermal energy (TSA) and mechanical energy (PSA) is a valid and accurate characterization. All factual statements align with the original text and established adsorption science principles.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately explains how TSA and PSA adjust temperature or pressure to maximize working capacity and correctly states key regeneration requirements. It cites the need to heat MOFs to around 200 °C for TSA to achieve amine-comparable working capacities and describes the standard four-step PSA cycle, both consistent with the provided PECS text. The energy trade-off between thermal input for TSA and mechanical energy for PSA is also correctly described. No factual or logical errors were found.",
