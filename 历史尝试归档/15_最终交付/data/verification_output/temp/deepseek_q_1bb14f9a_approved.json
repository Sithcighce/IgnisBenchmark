  "question_text": "How do non-noble metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) such as Fe, Co, and Ni achieve comparable catalytic activity to noble metal SACs in CO oxidation reactions, and what specific molecular interactions contribute to their enhanced performance?",
  "standard_answer": "Non-noble metal SACs achieve comparable catalytic activity to noble metal SACs in CO oxidation through specific molecular interactions that lower activation barriers. For Ni-based SACs, the molecular interaction between a Ni atom and an adsorbed CO gas molecule is weaker than CO binding irreversibly with Pt1 and Ir1 atoms. This weaker binding leads to a lower barrier in CO2 formation, enhancing the CO oxidation process. Computational studies have confirmed that Fe-, Co- and Ni-based SACs are capable of providing comparable catalytic activity for CO oxidation as compared with noble metal-based SACs (e.g., Pd-, Pt-, Ru- and Rh-based SACs). The weaker CO binding in non-noble metals prevents strong adsorption that could poison active sites, while still maintaining sufficient reactivity for the oxidation reaction to proceed efficiently.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Liang et al. [68] found that the molecular interaction between a Ni atom and an adsorbed CO gas molecule is weaker than CO binding irreversibly with Pt1 and Ir1 atoms. This further leads to a lower barrier in CO2 formation (i.e., enhances the CO oxidation process) under the use of Ni.",
    "2": "A recent computational study also suggested that the Fe-, Co- and Ni-based SACs were capable of providing a comparable catalytic activity for CO oxidation as compared with the noble metal-based SACs (e.g., Pd-, Pt-, Ru- and Rh-based SACs) [87]."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information from the original text. It correctly states that: (1) Ni-based SACs have weaker CO binding compared to Pt1 and Ir1, leading to lower barriers for CO2 formation; (2) Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based SACs provide comparable catalytic activity to noble metal SACs (Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh) for CO oxidation; (3) The weaker CO binding prevents site poisoning while maintaining sufficient reactivity. The answer appropriately synthesizes the key mechanisms and adds reasonable interpretation about the balance between preventing poisoning and maintaining reactivity, which is consistent with fundamental catalysis principles. No factual errors or logical contradictions are present.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately reflects the core points of the source: Ni exhibits weaker CO binding than Pt1/Ir1, lowering the barrier for CO2 formation and enhancing CO oxidation, and computational work indicates Fe/Co/Ni SACs can be comparable to noble metal SACs. The added rationale about avoiding site poisoning is reasonable and consistent with catalytic principles. Minor issues are wording strength ('confirmed' vs 'suggested') and slight generalization beyond the explicitly detailed Ni case.",

It correctly identifies that the weaker molecular interaction (binding) of CO with non-noble metal SACs is the key factor. This weaker binding leads to a lower activation barrier for CO2 formation, as stated in the text. The answer's additional explanation that this prevents catalyst poisoning from strong CO adsorption is a correct and logical extension of the provided information, consistent with established principles in catalysis (Sabatier principle).
