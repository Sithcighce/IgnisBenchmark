  "standard_answer": "Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) controls heat release rate and reduces knocking probability in low temperature combustion engines primarily through mixture dilution. The paper explicitly states that 'Mixture dilution by EGR also reduces HRR, thereby reducing knocking probability.' This mechanism works by introducing recirculated exhaust gases into the combustion chamber, which dilutes the fuel-air mixture and moderates the combustion process. The dilution effect slows down the chemical reactions and heat release, preventing the rapid pressure rise that characterizes knocking combustion. The paper further emphasizes that 'EGR reduces HRR, thereby reducing knocking probability,' indicating that the primary mechanism is the direct relationship between EGR-induced mixture dilution, reduced heat release rate, and consequent knocking suppression. This control strategy is particularly important in LTC engines where achieving optimal combustion phasing while avoiding destructive pressure oscillations is critical for stable operation across different engine loads.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the mechanisms described in the original text. It correctly identifies mixture dilution as the primary mechanism by which EGR reduces heat release rate (HRR) and knocking probability. The answer properly explains the causal chain: EGR → mixture dilution → reduced HRR → reduced knocking probability. The physical principles are sound - dilution does slow chemical reactions and moderate combustion, preventing rapid pressure rise characteristic of knocking. The additional context about LTC engines and combustion phasing, while not in the original excerpts, represents reasonable and accurate elaboration that doesn't contradict the source material. All factual statements are correct and logically consistent.",
