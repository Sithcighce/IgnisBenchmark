  "question_text": "In biochar used for combustion flue gas adsorption, how do the hierarchical pore structures (macropores >50 μm, mesopores 2–50 μm, micropores <2 μm) facilitate gaseous pollutant transport and adsorption? Explain the roles of bulk diffusion, surface diffusion, and Knudsen diffusion in this context, and describe how pore size relative to the mean free path of gas molecules influences the dominant diffusion mechanism in microporous biochar.",
  "standard_answer": "The hierarchical pore structure in biochar enables efficient transport and adsorption of gaseous pollutants from combustion flue gas. Macropores (>50 μm) function as primary conduits for bulk diffusion, allowing rapid mass transfer of gas molecules from the flue gas stream into the biochar interior. Mesopores (2–50 μm) serve as transmission channels where surface diffusion predominates, guiding molecules toward adsorption sites. Micropores (<2 μm) are the main physisorption sites where volume filling occurs due to enhanced adsorption potentials from overlapping van der Waals forces, rather than layer-by-layer coverage. In microporous biochar, Knudsen diffusion becomes the primary transport mechanism when pore sizes are smaller than the mean free path of gas molecules, causing frequent molecular collisions with pore walls to govern transport. This diffusion regime is particularly relevant for biochar with dominant microporosity, where the Knudsen diffusion coefficient can be predicted from kinetic theory by correlating biochar pore size with the adsorbate's mean free path. The hierarchical arrangement ensures optimal accessibility to active sites while maintaining efficient mass transfer throughout the pore network.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "In the gas-solid reaction system occurred in gas adsorption process of porous biochar, the macropore (>50 μm) in solid sorbent serves as a gate of gas flow, allowing the gas molecules transporting into the biochar interior rapidly for the following diffusion into the narrower pores; the mesopore (2–50 μm) serves as a molecule transmission channel from the surface to adsorption sites; and the micropore (<2 μm) serves as the main physisorption sites for gas molecule.",
    "2": "For gas-phase adsorption onto biochar which is dominantly microporous, gas molecular transfer via Knudsen diffusion primarily, and the Knudsen diffusion coefficient can be predicted from kinetic theory by correlating the pore size of biochar with the mean free path of the adsorbate."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and provides correct scientific explanations. Key points verified: (1) Hierarchical pore structure roles are correctly described - macropores for bulk diffusion/rapid transport, mesopores as transmission channels, micropores as main physisorption sites. (2) The answer correctly identifies Knudsen diffusion as the primary mechanism in microporous biochar when pore sizes are smaller than mean free path. (3) The explanation of Knudsen diffusion coefficient prediction from kinetic theory matches the original text. (4) Additional details about van der Waals forces, volume filling, and surface diffusion are scientifically sound and consistent with established adsorption theory. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent. The elaboration on diffusion mechanisms and adsorption phenomena represents valid scientific knowledge that complements rather than contradicts the source material.",

It correctly identifies Knudsen diffusion as the dominant mechanism in microporous biochar when pore size is smaller than the gas mean free path and notes that the Knudsen coefficient can be derived from kinetic theory via pore size and mean free path. The added explanations on bulk diffusion in macropores, surface diffusion in mesopores, and micropore filling mechanisms are consistent with established principles and do not contradict the ground truth.",

          "The answer incorrectly states that surface diffusion 'predominates' in mesopores (defined as 2–50 μm). In pores of this size, which are significantly larger than the mean free path of gas molecules under typical flue gas conditions, the dominant transport mechanism in the gas phase is bulk diffusion or slip-flow, not surface diffusion."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer contains a factual error regarding the dominant transport mechanism in mesopores. It claims surface diffusion predominates in pores of 2-50 μm. For pores of this size, gas-phase transport (primarily bulk diffusion) is the main pathway for molecules through the pore volume. Surface diffusion is a parallel mechanism occurring on the pore walls, but it is not generally the predominant mode of transport in such large pores. The original text more accurately describes mesopores simply as 'transmission channels' without making a specific, and in this case incorrect, claim about the dominant diffusion type.",
