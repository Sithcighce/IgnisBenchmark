  "question_text": "What is the energy partitioning in methane hydrate combustion, and why does water evaporation dominate the energy sink despite the hydrate's ice-like structure?",
  "standard_answer": "The energy partitioning in methane hydrate combustion reveals that water evaporation consumes the majority of combustion energy due to its high latent heat relative to other phase changes. For an ideal hydrate with 5.75:1 water/methane molar ratio, the total energy needed to convert solid hydrate to gas phase is 2.64 MJ/kg, with evaporation alone requiring 1.96 MJ/kg (74% of total). Comparatively, melting ice requires only 0.288 MJ/kg, and sensible heating to boiling temperature needs 0.392 MJ/kg. This dominance occurs because the enthalpy of evaporation (2260 kJ/kg) is nearly 7 times greater than the enthalpy of fusion (333 kJ/kg). The combustion heat from methane (LHV 50 MJ/kg) must therefore primarily overcome water vaporization, leaving only 39-48% of energy available depending on hydrate saturation. This explains why continuous combustion requires liquid water drainage rather than complete evaporation, as flame temperatures would otherwise drop below sustainable levels (~1252K adiabatic for 7:1 ratio versus ~1700K observed).",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and applies correct thermophysical principles. Key facts verified: (1) Water evaporation is the dominant energy sink, consuming 1.96 MJ/kg out of 2.64 MJ/kg total (74%), matching the original data. (2) The 39-48% range for percentage of combustion heat needed aligns with the original table values (39%, 42%, 48%). (3) The physical explanation is sound: evaporation enthalpy (2260 kJ/kg) being ~7 times fusion enthalpy (333 kJ/kg) correctly explains the dominance. (4) The comparison values for melting (0.288 MJ/kg) and sensible heating (0.392 MJ/kg) are thermodynamically reasonable. (5) The mechanistic explanation about flame temperature and the need for liquid drainage is logically consistent with combustion thermodynamics. The answer provides additional detail beyond the original text (e.g., specific temperature values, LHV of methane), but these additions are factually correct and enhance understanding without contradicting the source material.",

However, it inverts the meaning of the 39–48% figure from the original text: that percentage is the portion of combustion heat required for hydrate phase transformation, not the portion left available.
