  "question_text": "How do catalyst–support interactions, such as oxygen spillover in Pt/CeO2 systems, enhance methane oxidation rates, and what nanoscale effects govern the reduction in oxygen vacancy formation energy?",
  "standard_answer": "Catalyst–support interactions, particularly oxygen spillover, enhance methane oxidation by facilitating oxygen transfer between the support and metal catalyst, increasing active oxygen species availability. In Pt/CeO2 systems, reducible CeO2 donates lattice oxygen to Pt nanoparticles via spillover, creating oxygen vacancies on ceria. This process is driven by nanoscale effects: DFT calculations show that oxygen vacancy formation energy (E_vac) drops from 2.25 eV on bulk CeO2(111) to 0.80 eV on Ce40O80 nanoclusters, making reverse spillover (oxygen from ceria to Pt) energetically favorable. The lower E_vac in nanostructured ceria arises from increased surface-to-volume ratio and undercoordinated sites, which stabilize oxygen vacancies and promote redox cycles. Spillover supplies activated oxygen to Pt surfaces, where it reacts with adsorbed CH4, lowering the activation barrier for C–H bond cleavage. Additionally, electron transfer from Pt to ceria creates Ce3+ sites, further enhancing oxygen mobility and catalytic activity. This synergy reduces sintering and improves durability, as oxygenated Pt surfaces bond strongly to reduced ceria. Thus, nanoscale engineering of support morphology and metal–support interfaces optimizes oxygen transport and reaction kinetics, significantly boosting methane oxidation rates beyond what either component achieves alone.",

    "1": "Spillover of oxygen to Pt is accompanied by increase in the concentration of Ce+3 in ceria, and is a nanoscale effect, which requires nanostructured Pt particles in intimate contact with ceria.",
    "2": "Formation of oxygen vacancies is heavily favored by nanostructuring, where energy of oxygen vacancies is reduced significantly from 2.25 eV for the bulk CeO2(111) surface to 0.80 eV for Ce40O80."

Key facts are verified: (1) oxygen vacancy formation energy decreases from 2.25 eV for bulk CeO2(111) to 0.80 eV for Ce40O80 nanoclusters, matching the original text exactly; (2) the answer correctly identifies this as a nanoscale effect requiring nanostructured Pt in intimate contact with ceria; (3) the answer correctly mentions the increase in Ce3+ concentration accompanying oxygen spillover. The additional mechanistic details provided (DFT calculations, spillover mechanisms, C-H bond cleavage, electron transfer, reduced sintering) are consistent with established catalysis principles and do not contradict the original text. The answer appropriately elaborates on how these nanoscale effects enhance methane oxidation rates through improved oxygen transport and reaction kinetics, which is scientifically sound and addresses the question comprehensively.",
