  "question_text": "How does the specific energy density limitation of current lithium-ion batteries fundamentally constrain electric aviation applications, and what are the key technological challenges that must be overcome to enable larger aircraft deployment?",
  "standard_answer": "The specific energy density limitation of current lithium-ion batteries (300-400 Wh/kg) fundamentally constrains electric aviation by severely limiting flight range and payload capacity. This represents only about 2.5-3.3% of the specific energy density of Jet A-1 kerosene (approximately 12,000 Wh/kg), making battery-powered aviation impractical for long-range commercial flights. The key technological challenge this poses is the development of energy-dense batteries that are as light and compact as possible. Current lithium-ion battery technology has been applied as a sole energy source only for small aircraft capable of carrying fewer than 20 passengers per flight mission. For larger aircraft, electric aviation requires hybridization with conventional or alternative kerosene systems due to insufficient energy storage capacity. The fundamental constraint forces electric aviation to remain limited to small-scale applications, while overcoming this limitation requires breakthroughs in battery chemistry, materials science, and energy storage systems to achieve the necessary weight-to-energy ratios for commercial aviation viability.",

    "1": "One challenge this poses is the development of energy-dense batteries as light and compact as possible, which is challenging with today's lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology (around 300–400 Wh kg⁻¹), relative to Jet A-1 (approx. 12,000 Wh kg⁻¹)",
    "2": "Current Li-ion batteries have nevertheless been applied as a sole energy source for small aircraft capable of carrying less than 20 passengers per flight missions"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text. It correctly states the specific energy density of Li-ion batteries (300-400 Wh/kg) and Jet A-1 kerosene (~12,000 Wh/kg), accurately calculates the percentage ratio (2.5-3.3%), and correctly notes that current Li-ion batteries have only been applied to small aircraft carrying fewer than 20 passengers. The answer appropriately identifies the fundamental constraint on electric aviation and the need for hybridization for larger aircraft. The additional context about technological challenges and the need for breakthroughs in battery chemistry is a reasonable elaboration that doesn't contradict the original text. All physical principles and cause-effect relationships are correctly stated.",

It is consistent with the statement that Li-ion has been applied as a sole energy source only for small aircraft (<20 passengers).

It correctly identifies the specific energy density values for Li-ion batteries (300-400 Wh/kg) and Jet A-1 (approx. 12,000 Wh/kg), and accurately calculates the relative percentage (2.5-3.3%). The conclusion that this disparity severely limits flight range and payload, restricting current all-electric applications to small aircraft (<20 passengers), is sound and aligns perfectly with the source material and established principles in aviation engineering.",
