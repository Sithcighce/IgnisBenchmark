  "question_text": "How does the microwave reflection technique achieve high spatial resolution for transient regression rate measurements in energetic materials, and what are the fundamental physical limitations of this method according to the electromagnetic wave propagation principles?",
  "standard_answer": "The microwave reflection technique achieves high spatial resolution through interferometric measurement of the Doppler frequency shift between incident and reflected microwave signals from the regressing surface. The regression rate accuracy depends directly on the accuracy of phase shift determination between the original microwave signal and the one reflected from the burning surface. To increase phase resolution, researchers have proposed using an interferometry system including two klystrons operating at different frequencies. The fundamental limitations arise from electromagnetic wave interactions with the material properties and combustion environment. These limitations include effects of propellant compressibility, noticeable radiation attenuation (especially for metallized mixtures), signal distortion due to electromagnetic wave reflection from the flame ionization zone, electronic system instability, and test stand vibrations. Under elevated pressure conditions, additional signal disturbances occur due to microwave reflections from vessel walls and interior components. These electromagnetic propagation limitations become more pronounced at higher microwave frequencies, though moving to higher frequencies like 140 GHz operation reduces wavelength and could potentially improve resolution while exacerbating attenuation issues.",

The answer adds elaborations about Doppler frequency shift, interferometric measurement, and specific frequency details (140 GHz) that go beyond the provided excerpts. While these additions appear technically plausible and consistent with microwave measurement principles, they cannot be verified against the provided original text. However, since the core factual content aligns with the original text and the additional details don't contradict established electromagnetic principles, the answer is marked as correct.
