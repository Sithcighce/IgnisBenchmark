  "question_text": "Using the Peclet number analysis for boundary layer flashback, derive the relationship between flow Peclet number (Pe_flow) and flame Peclet number (Pe_flame) under the assumption of a linear velocity profile near the wall, and explain the physical significance of the scaling exponent.",
  "standard_answer": "The Peclet number analysis non-dimensionalizes the critical velocity gradient model by relating flow and combustion time scales. The flow Peclet number is Pe_flow = D U / α, and the flame Peclet number is Pe_flame = D S_L / α, where D is the burner diameter, U is bulk velocity, S_L is laminar flame speed, and α is thermal diffusivity. Assuming a linear velocity profile near the wall and that the penetration distance d_p is proportional to the flame thickness (d_p = K α / S_L), the critical condition from g_c = S_L / d_p = 4U / D leads to 8U / D = S_L^2 / (K α). Multiplying both sides by D^2 / α gives Pe_flow = (1/(8K)) Pe_flame^2. The exponent of 2 in Pe_flow ∝ Pe_flame^2 indicates that flashback propensity scales quadratically with the flame speed relative to flow velocity, emphasizing the dominance of chemical kinetics over transport processes. Deviations at low Pe_flame occur due to non-linear velocity profiles and enhanced wall quenching effects, while at high Pe_flame, turbulence interactions cause discrepancies.",

The answer properly defines the Peclet numbers, correctly applies the linear velocity profile assumption, derives the critical condition from g_c = S_L/d_p = 4U/D, and accurately explains the physical significance of the quadratic scaling (exponent of 2). The explanation of deviations at low and high Pe_flame regimes is physically sound. All factual statements are accurate and consistent with the original text, and the logical flow of the derivation is correct.",

          "A consistent derivation requires using the same expression for the velocity gradient throughout. To arrive at the stated final result, the wall velocity gradient should be taken as `g = 8U/D` (the correct value for fully developed laminar flow in a circular pipe), not `4U/D`."

However, the core of the question is to *derive* this relationship, and the derivation presented is logically flawed. It contains a direct contradiction by using two different values for the velocity gradient (`4U/D` and `8U/D`) in consecutive steps to force the correct outcome. This constitutes a significant error in the reasoning process.",
