  "question_text": "How do the different decomposition behaviors of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin during pyrolysis affect the porosity development and final carbon structure in biomass-derived anodes?",
  "standard_answer": "The three main biomass components exhibit distinct pyrolysis behaviors that significantly influence final carbon structure. Cellulose decomposes between 200-400°C with high oxygen content leading to extensive evolution of H2O, CO2, and CO, creating abundant micropores through volatile release. Its crystalline nature and high polymeric degree facilitate formation of well-defined porous structures. Hemicellulose decomposes at 200-320°C, being amorphous and highly branched, it contributes to mesopore formation but with less structural regularity. Lignin decomposes slowly over a broader temperature range (200-500°C) and, despite its lower oxygen content, its complex cross-linked aromatic structure resists pore formation and tends to produce nonporous carbon. The oxygen from functional groups in cellulose and hemicellulose transforms into gases more readily, enabling easier activation and micropore generation. In contrast, lignin's aromatic subunits and short-range ordering lead to denser carbon structures with limited porosity. The relative proportions of these components in biomass determine the final pore architecture, with cellulose-rich materials typically yielding higher specific surface areas and better-developed pore networks suitable for ion storage in battery applications.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "During pyrolysis, oxygen from the functional groups in cellulosic and hemicellulosic biomass transforms easily into H2O, CO and CO2 and enables an easier activation and generation of micropores. By contrast, the aromatic subunits in lignin conduct to form nonporous carbon despite the presence of oxygen-containing groups, because these are less effective in pore creation.",
    "2": "The thermal decomposition of lignin is slower over a broader temperature range (200-500°C) than that of cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellulose decomposes between 200-400°C, whereas hemicellulose decomposes in the 200-320°C range."

Additional elaborations (e.g., crystalline nature of cellulose, lower oxygen content of lignin, impacts on specific surface area) are reasonable and do not contradict the source.",
