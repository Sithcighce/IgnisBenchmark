  "question_text": "Using the mechanisms described in the provided paper, explain how injector deposits in GDI engines alter spray characteristics and how these changes subsequently affect combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions. Include the specific spray parameters affected and the resulting combustion consequences.",
  "standard_answer": "Injector deposits in GDI engines fundamentally alter spray characteristics through multiple mechanisms. Deposits accumulate on nozzle surfaces, reducing the effective flow area and consequently decreasing fuel flow rates. This leads to significant changes in spray morphology: spray angle and envelope are likely to be affected, while spray penetration distance and droplet diameter can be increased. The distorted spray pattern results in poor fuel-air mixing, which directly impacts combustion efficiency. The direct consequence is increased fuel impingement and non-optimum combustion, or even misfire; thus engine power output is reduced and emissions are increased. Particulate matter emissions dramatically increase as the fuel injector becomes fouled due to the compromised spray quality. These effects are particularly pronounced in stratified combustion modes where precise fuel-air mixing is critical for efficient combustion. The combination of reduced flow rates, altered spray patterns, and larger droplet sizes creates conditions favorable for incomplete combustion and higher emissions across multiple pollutant categories.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key mechanisms from the original text. It correctly explains that deposits reduce effective flow area and fuel flow rates, alter spray characteristics (angle, envelope, penetration distance, droplet diameter), and lead to poor fuel-air mixing. The combustion consequences are properly identified: increased fuel impingement, non-optimum combustion/misfire, reduced power output, and increased emissions (especially particulates). The answer adds contextual details about stratified combustion modes and the relationship between spray quality and incomplete combustion, which are reasonable elaborations consistent with combustion science principles. No factual errors or logical contradictions are present.",
