  "question_text": "Explain the combustion mechanisms of organic carbonate electrolytes during lithium-ion battery thermal runaway, focusing on how their thermophysical properties contribute to flammability and jet flame formation. Discuss the role of electrolyte vaporization, decomposition products, and aerosol formation in creating combustible mixtures that can be ignited by various sources.",
  "standard_answer": "Organic carbonate electrolytes pose significant fire risks during thermal runaway due to their inherent flammability properties and the formation of combustible mixtures. When batteries are exposed to high temperatures, the solvents vaporize and decompose, creating a mixture of aerosol droplets, electrolyte vapor, and decomposition products. This mixture can be ignited by various ignition sources such as electric sparks and hot surfaces. The low flash points of carbonate solvents like EC, DMC, and EMC make them easily ignitable, facilitating rapid combustion initiation. During thermal runaway, the electrolyte mass fraction constitutes approximately 10% of the cell mass, contributing significantly to the total combustion energy. When ejected under pressure during venting events, these flammable mixtures can form jet flames that enhance heat transfer to adjacent cells, promoting fire propagation in battery packs. The combination of low flash points, substantial energy content, and gas generation mechanisms makes carbonate electrolytes a primary contributor to LIB fire hazards, with the mixture of aerosol droplets, electrolyte vapor, and decomposition products creating ideal conditions for ignition and sustained combustion.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The mixture of the aerosol droplets, electrolyte vapor and its decomposition products can be ignited by an ignition source, such as an electric spark and hot surface.",
    "2": "EC, DMC and EMC have a low flash point and thus can be easily ignited. The chain and cyclic organic carbonates have different strength and weakness, so the mixture of different solvents is chosen in practice in order to gain better electrochemical performance.",
    "3": "Generally, the mass fraction of the electrolyte is about 10% of the cell mass. In Ribière's study, the maximum effective combustion heat was determined to be 4.03 ± 0.34 MJ kg⁻¹ of cells, and the electrolyte contributed up to 1.92 MJ kg⁻¹."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key points from the original text and contains no factual errors. It correctly describes: (1) ignition of aerosol/vapor/decomposition product mixtures by sparks and hot surfaces, (2) low flash points of EC, DMC, and EMC making them easily ignitable, (3) electrolyte mass fraction of ~10% and its contribution to combustion energy (consistent with the cited values of 4.03 MJ/kg total and 1.92 MJ/kg from electrolyte). The answer appropriately elaborates on jet flame formation and fire propagation mechanisms, which are logical extensions consistent with the combustion science principles and the original text. The physical and chemical principles stated are correct, and the cause-effect relationships are sound. While the answer is more detailed than the original text excerpts, all additional explanations are accurate and relevant to the question.",

        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground-truth statements: it correctly notes that aerosol/vapor/decomposition mixtures are ignitable by sparks/hot surfaces, that EC/DMC/EMC have low flash points and are easily ignited, and that electrolyte mass is ~10% with significant contribution to combustion energy. The mention of jet flame formation during pressured venting is accurate and consistent with known behavior, without contradicting the provided text.
