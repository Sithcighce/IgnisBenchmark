  "question_text": "Using the Arrhenius parameters for bridge scission in the CPD model (Eb = 55.4 kcal/mol, Ab = 2.6e15 s^-1), calculate the characteristic time for labile bridge decomposition at a particle temperature of 800 K and explain how this timescale influences the devolatilization rate under high heating rate conditions.",
  "standard_answer": "The characteristic time for labile bridge decomposition is the inverse of the rate constant: τ = 1/k, where k = Ab * exp(-Eb/(RG*T)). Using Eb = 55.4 kcal/mol = 231.8 kJ/mol, RG = 8.314 J/mol·K, T = 800 K, and Ab = 2.6e15 s^-1, first convert Eb to J/mol: 231,800 J/mol. Then, k = 2.6e15 * exp(-231,800/(8.314*800)) = 2.6e15 * exp(-34.85) ≈ 2.6e15 * 7.5e-16 ≈ 1.95 s^-1. Thus, τ ≈ 0.513 seconds. This timescale indicates that at 800 K, bridge scission is relatively slow, meaning devolatilization is kinetically controlled. Under high heating rates (e.g., >10^4 K/s), the particle temperature rises rapidly, reducing τ exponentially (e.g., at 1200 K, τ ≈ 0.001 s). Consequently, the devolatilization rate becomes limited by heat transfer to the particle interior rather than kinetics, leading to metaplast accumulation and potential tar cracking. The distributed activation energy (σb = 1.8 kcal/mol) further broadens the reaction distribution, causing sequential bridge breaking across a temperature range, which must be coupled with intra-particle heat conduction models in CFD to predict volatile release accurately.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly applies the Arrhenius equation to calculate the characteristic time for bridge scission. The numerical calculation is accurate: k = 2.6e15 * exp(-231800/(8.314*800)) = 2.6e15 * exp(-34.85) ≈ 1.95 s^-1, giving τ ≈ 0.513 s. The physical interpretation is sound: at 800 K, bridge scission is relatively slow (kinetically controlled), but at higher temperatures under rapid heating, the timescale decreases exponentially, shifting the rate-limiting step to heat transfer. The discussion of metaplast accumulation, tar cracking, and the role of distributed activation energy (σb = 1.8 kcal/mol) is consistent with CPD model principles. All parameters match the original text (Eb = 55.4 kcal/mol, Ab = 2.6e15 s^-1, σb = 1.8 kcal/mol). The answer provides appropriate context for high heating rate conditions and CFD coupling, which are relevant extensions of the core calculation.

According to the verification criteria, numerical errors should be penalized, and this error is substantial enough to make the answer incorrect.",
