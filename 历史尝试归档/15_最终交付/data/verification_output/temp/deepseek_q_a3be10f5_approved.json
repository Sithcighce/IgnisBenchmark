  "question_text": "Why does ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis configuration generally yield higher monoaromatic hydrocarbons and lower coke compared to in-situ configuration?",
  "standard_answer": "The ex-situ configuration separates pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading into distinct reactors, allowing optimized control over temperature and vapor-catalyst contact time, which enhances monoaromatic selectivity and reduces coke. In ex-situ mode, pyrolysis vapors are generated in the primary reactor and then directed to a secondary catalyst bed, where temperature can be precisely set to favor deoxygenation and aromatization without promoting excessive cracking or polymerization. This separation minimizes the exposure of catalysts to biomass ash and char, reducing active site poisoning and metal contamination. Additionally, shorter and more controlled vapor residence times in the catalyst bed limit secondary reactions that form polyaromatics and coke. In contrast, in-situ configuration co-locates biomass and catalyst, leading to inhomogeneous temperatures, longer contact times, and higher likelihood of vapor condensation and coke deposition on catalyst surfaces. The ex-situ setup also facilitates the use of serial catalyst beds or steam/hydrogen co-feeding, further improving deoxygenation and suppressing coke-forming pathways.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains why ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis yields higher monoaromatic hydrocarbons and lower coke compared to in-situ configuration. The core mechanisms are accurate: (1) separation of pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading allows independent control of operating conditions, which is directly supported by the original text; (2) enhanced selectivity to monoaromatics (benzene, toluene) is explicitly confirmed by the original text. The answer provides additional mechanistic details (temperature control, reduced catalyst poisoning, controlled residence times, minimized secondary reactions) that are scientifically sound and logically consistent with combustion science and catalytic pyrolysis principles. These elaborations do not contradict the original text but rather explain the underlying reasons for the observations stated in the original text. The physical and chemical principles regarding deoxygenation, aromatization, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are all correctly stated. No factual errors or logical contradictions are present.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains that ex-situ separates pyrolysis and upgrading, enabling independent control of temperatures and contact times, which increases selectivity to monoaromatics and reduces coke—fully consistent with the ground truth. Additional points about minimizing ash/char exposure and limiting secondary reactions are physically reasonable and align with known mechanisms. Minor speculative details do not undermine the core correctness.",
