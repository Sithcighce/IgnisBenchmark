  "question_text": "How does turbulence-chemistry interaction (TCI) affect ignition delay time in low-temperature combustion (LTC) strategies, and what are the underlying physical mechanisms?",
  "standard_answer": "Turbulence-chemistry interaction significantly prolongs ignition delay time in LTC strategies through multiple mechanisms. At low initial temperatures (e.g., 850 K), turbulent fluctuations enhance the dissipation of heat and radical species during the first-stage ignition process, retarding the transition to high-temperature combustion. The transport probability density function (PDF) model shows that unresolved turbulent fluctuations broaden the thermochemical state distribution, increasing mixing timescales and delaying autoignition. Compared to well-stirred reactor models, TCI consideration reveals a 0.95 ms longer ignition delay at 850 K versus only 0.27 ms at 1000 K, demonstrating stronger TCI effects at lower temperatures. This occurs because turbulence enhances molecular interdiffusion through eddy breakup, steepening concentration gradients while simultaneously dissipating critical intermediate species like H2O2 and CH2O that drive low-temperature chemistry pathways.",

    "1": "At lower gas temperatures, the reactivity of the mixture is reduced. The already formed heat and intermediate radicals can be transported outside owing to the gradients.",
    "2": "A high turbulence intensity results in the dissipation of heat and radicals during the first-stage ignition process, thereby retarding the ignition process"

Key points verified: (1) Turbulence prolongs ignition delay through heat and radical dissipation - matches original text [2]; (2) Lower temperatures show stronger TCI effects due to reduced reactivity and enhanced transport - consistent with original text [1]; (3) Physical mechanisms (eddy breakup, concentration gradients, intermediate species dissipation) are scientifically sound; (4) Specific numerical examples (0.95 ms vs 0.27 ms delay differences) provide quantitative support without contradicting principles; (5) The explanation of PDF models and thermochemical state distribution broadening represents valid elaboration beyond the original text but contains no errors. The answer is detailed but all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with established combustion science.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly aligns with the ground-truth: at low temperatures, reduced reactivity combined with turbulence-induced dissipation/transport of heat and radicals during first-stage ignition retards ignition and prolongs ignition delay. It appropriately emphasizes stronger TCI effects at lower temperatures and the role of turbulent fluctuations in broadening thermochemical states. Minor terminology and unverifiable quantitative details do not undermine the core correctness.",

It accurately states that turbulence prolongs ignition delay by dissipating heat and radicals, which is directly supported by the original text.

The quantitative example correctly illustrates the stronger effect of TCI at lower temperatures, a well-established phenomenon.",
