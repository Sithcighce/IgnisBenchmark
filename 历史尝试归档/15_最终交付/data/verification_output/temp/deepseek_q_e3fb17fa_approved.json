  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper excerpt, explain how particle size and gas residence time affect bio-oil yield in fluid bed fast pyrolysis reactors, and describe the underlying mechanisms supported by the cited content.",
  "standard_answer": "The paper states that 'in order to achieve a high oil yield with the fluid bed reactor, the biomass particles should preferably be smaller than a few mm in diameter [107-111].' Smaller particle sizes enhance heat transfer by increasing the surface area-to-volume ratio, allowing for more efficient heat conduction from the hot sand to the biomass. This rapid heating promotes primary pyrolysis reactions that generate condensable vapors while minimizing secondary char-forming reactions. Additionally, 'the gas residence time should normally be below 2 s in order to achieve a maximum liquid yield [106].' Short residence times limit vapor cracking and repolymerization, which would otherwise convert valuable condensable compounds into permanent gases or char. The combined effect of small particles and brief vapor contact ensures that pyrolysis vapors are quickly quenched, preserving the bio-oil yield by reducing thermal degradation pathways. These mechanisms align with the principles of fast pyrolysis, where high heating rates and minimal vapor residence time are critical for maximizing liquid product formation.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the original text and provides scientifically sound explanations. It correctly states that biomass particles should be smaller than a few mm (citing [107-111]) and that gas residence time should be below 2 s (citing [106]). The mechanistic explanations are consistent with established fast pyrolysis principles: (1) smaller particles enhance heat transfer through increased surface area-to-volume ratio, promoting rapid heating and primary pyrolysis while minimizing secondary char formation; (2) short residence times prevent vapor cracking and repolymerization that would reduce bio-oil yield. The cause-effect relationships are correct, the physical principles (heat transfer, reaction kinetics) are accurately stated, and the answer logically connects particle size and residence time to bio-oil yield maximization. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all additional explanations are scientifically accurate and relevant to the question.",
