  "question_text": "Why do multichannel minireactors outperform conventional fixed-bed reactors in CO₂ methanation, particularly in terms of heat management and reaction efficiency?",
  "standard_answer": "Multichannel minireactors excel over conventional fixed-bed reactors in CO₂ methanation due to superior heat and mass transfer characteristics. The exothermic nature of methanation (ΔH = -164.63 kJ/mol) can cause hot spots in fixed-beds, leading to catalyst deactivation, reduced selectivity, and safety risks. Minireactors feature small channel diameters (e.g., in multichannel designs), which enhance surface-to-volume ratios, improving heat dissipation to cooling surfaces and minimizing temperature gradients. This prevents localized overheating and maintains isothermal conditions, crucial for controlling side reactions like RWGS. Mass transfer is also enhanced through shorter diffusion paths, ensuring efficient reactant-catalyst contact and higher volumetric productivity. For example, a multichannel minireactor achieved 96.1% CO₂ conversion and >99% CH₄ selectivity at 350°C and 15 bar, handling 820 Nm³/h CO₂ per m² of channel, outperforming fixed-beds where hot spots are inevitable even with dilution. The compact design allows for better scalability and integration with heat recovery systems, making it ideal for high-intensity exothermic processes.",

    "1": "The multichannel minireactor showed a superior performance compared to a fixed-bed reactor. A maximum CH₄ selectivity higher than 99% at 96.1% CO₂ conversion was obtained at 350°C",
    "2": "The small channel diameter results in better gas/particle contact while enhancing heat transfer, which could avoid the hot spot formation"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains why multichannel minireactors outperform conventional fixed-bed reactors in CO₂ methanation. Key points verified: (1) The exothermic nature and enthalpy value (ΔH = -164.63 kJ/mol) are correct for CO₂ methanation. (2) The answer correctly identifies hot spot formation as a major issue in fixed-bed reactors, consistent with original text [2]. (3) The mechanism of enhanced heat transfer through small channel diameters and improved surface-to-volume ratios is accurately described and aligns with [2]. (4) The performance data (96.1% CO₂ conversion, >99% CH₄ selectivity at 350°C) matches [1] exactly. (5) The explanation of enhanced mass transfer through shorter diffusion paths and better gas/particle contact is consistent with [2]. (6) The physical principles regarding heat management, isothermal conditions, and prevention of side reactions (RWGS) are thermodynamically sound. While the answer is detailed and includes additional context beyond the original text (e.g., pressure conditions, volumetric productivity, scalability), all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with combustion science and reactor engineering principles.",
