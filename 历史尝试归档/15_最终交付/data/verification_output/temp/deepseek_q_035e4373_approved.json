  "question_text": "How does the particle size distribution of REY-bearing minerals in coal influence their partitioning behavior in fly ash during combustion, and what specific mechanisms drive this size-dependent enrichment according to the provided paper content?",
  "standard_answer": "The particle size distribution of REY-bearing minerals in coal significantly influences their partitioning behavior in fly ash through combustion dynamics and ash formation mechanisms. According to the paper, 'The particle size of most of REE-bearing phase in REY-rich coal is considered in the size of < 10 μm and some fractions are even sub-micron particles.' This fine particle size distribution leads to preferential entrainment in flue gas streams due to lower inertia, allowing these particles to remain suspended longer in the boiler environment. During pulverized coal combustion, REY-bearing minerals undergo transformation and retention processes. The paper states that 'REY partitioning in various emission streams, the size distribution, and their enrichment behavior in coal ash were discussed,' indicating that finer particles tend to concentrate in fly ash fractions rather than bottom ash. Two key retention mechanisms are proposed: 'the incorporation of the individual REY phases into the glass as inclusions and the diffusion of REY phases throughout Si-Al glass structures in the melting process.' The fine particle size enhances surface area for these retention mechanisms, particularly the diffusion into aluminosilicate glass matrices that form during ash melting. Additionally, the spatial distribution within coal particles matters - included minerals within coal char experience different thermal conditions than excluded minerals, affecting their transformation behavior. The enrichment typically increases with decreasing particle size due to enhanced surface interactions and better incorporation into glassy phases during ash formation.",
