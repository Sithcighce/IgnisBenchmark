  "question_text": "Calculate the temperature difference between the core and surface of a cylindrical lithium-ion battery with a radius of 10 mm, thermal conductivity of 1 W/m·K, heat transfer coefficient of 50 W/m²·K, and volumetric heat generation of 50,000 W/m³. Assume steady-state conditions and radial symmetry.",
  "standard_answer": "For a cylindrical battery under steady-state conditions with radial symmetry, the temperature difference between core and surface (ΔT = T_core - T_surface) can be derived from the heat conduction equation. The volumetric heat generation q_gen = 50,000 W/m³, radius R = 0.01 m, thermal conductivity k = 1 W/m·K. The heat generation per unit length Q = q_gen * πR² = 50,000 * π * (0.01)² = 15.708 W/m. For a cylinder, the temperature distribution is parabolic: T(r) = T_surface + (q_gen / (4k)) * (R² - r²). Thus, at the core (r=0), T_core = T_surface + (q_gen * R²) / (4k) = T_surface + (50,000 * (0.01)²) / (4 * 1) = T_surface + (50,000 * 0.0001) / 4 = T_surface + 5 / 4 = T_surface + 1.25°C. The Biot number Bi = hR/k = (50 * 0.01) / 1 = 0.5, which is >0.1, confirming significant internal gradients. The calculated ΔT = 1.25°C represents the core-to-surface difference due to internal heat generation, but actual values may be higher under dynamic operations or with anisotropic conductivity.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Under high-rate operations or forced convective cooling conditions, the temperature difference between the battery core and the surface in some cylindrical cells with a large radius could be larger than 10°C.",
    "2": "The Biot number could be larger than 0.1 so that the temperature at the battery center could be significantly higher than that at the surface."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the heat conduction equation for a cylindrical geometry with volumetric heat generation. The calculation of ΔT = 1.25°C is mathematically correct using the given parameters (q_gen = 50,000 W/m³, R = 0.01 m, k = 1 W/m·K). The Biot number calculation (Bi = 0.5) is accurate and correctly interpreted as indicating significant internal temperature gradients (>0.1 threshold). The answer appropriately notes that the calculated 1.25°C is for the specific conditions given, and acknowledges that actual values may be higher under different operating conditions (high-rate operations, anisotropic conductivity), which is consistent with the original text's statement that temperature differences 'could be larger than 10°C' under high-rate operations or forced convective cooling in large-radius cells. The answer does not contradict the original text; rather, it provides a specific calculation for the given parameters while recognizing that other conditions can produce larger temperature differences. All physical principles and mathematical derivations are sound.",

The Biot number calculation (0.5) is correct and aligns with the original text’s note that Bi > 0.1 indicates significant internal gradients. The result does not contradict the ground-truth statement that larger cells or more extreme conditions can yield >10°C differences.",
