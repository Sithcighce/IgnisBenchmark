  "standard_answer": "Transverse acoustic oscillations excite hydrodynamic instabilities through several mechanisms. First, the transverse acoustic velocity field creates an asymmetric pressure distribution around bluff bodies or swirlers, leading to periodic vortex shedding from alternating edges. This occurs because the acoustic velocity component perpendicular to the mean flow direction imposes a time-varying pressure gradient across the flame holder. For a bluff body, when the transverse acoustic velocity is directed from one side, it accelerates flow separation on that edge while suppressing it on the opposite side, creating a vortex that sheds into the wake. As the acoustic cycle reverses, the shedding switches to the other side. These vortices convect downstream and interact with the flame, causing fluctuations in flame surface area through roll-up and stretching. The enhanced mixing in vortex cores can also alter local equivalence ratio and reaction rates. The synchronization between the acoustic period and vortex convection time to the flame midpoint creates a phase-locked heat release oscillation. This mechanism is particularly effective when the Strouhal number (St = fL/u0) is near unity, ensuring optimal timing between vortex generation and flame interaction.",

    "1": "In all these studies, asymmetric vortex shedding from alternating edges of the flame-holder were observed, driven by the asymmetry of the transverse acoustic mode relative to the combustor centerline.",
    "2": "These data show synchronization between transverse velocity fluctuations in the chamber and vortex rollup on the flameholder."

It accurately describes: (1) asymmetric pressure distribution and vortex shedding from alternating edges due to transverse acoustic velocity, which is consistent with the original text's statement about 'asymmetric vortex shedding from alternating edges driven by the asymmetry of the transverse acoustic mode'; (2) synchronization between acoustic oscillations and vortex dynamics, matching the original text's observation of 'synchronization between transverse velocity fluctuations and vortex rollup'; (3) correct physical mechanisms including flow separation, vortex convection, flame-vortex interaction, and heat release fluctuations; (4) appropriate mention of Strouhal number for timing optimization. The answer provides additional mechanistic detail (pressure gradients, mixing effects, phase-locking) that is physically sound and does not contradict the original text. All cause-effect relationships are correct, and the thermophysical principles are accurately stated.",
