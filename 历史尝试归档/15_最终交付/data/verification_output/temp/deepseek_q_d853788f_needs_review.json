  "question_text": "How does the inverse jet diffusion flame (IJDF) configuration fundamentally alter soot formation mechanisms compared to normal jet diffusion flames (NJDF), and what are the key fluid dynamic and chemical kinetic factors responsible for reduced soot volume fraction in IJDF?",
  "standard_answer": "The IJDF configuration fundamentally alters soot formation by reversing the reactant delivery mode, with central air surrounded by annular fuel, which decouples soot oxidation from evolution. In NJDF, soot forms on the fuel-rich side of the flame sheet, remains in high-temperature zones for extended residence times, and undergoes significant surface growth and oxidation, leading to higher soot volume fractions (∼10⁻⁷). In contrast, IJDF's flow dynamics cause incipient soot particles to be carried across the flame sheet by the high-velocity central air jet, reducing residence time in high-temperature regions and inhibiting surface growth. Key factors include: (1) Enhanced fuel entrainment and mixing due to the relative momentum between air and fuel jets, which limits soot precursor (e.g., PAH) accumulation. (2) The annular sooting zone in IJDF is sandwiched between inner OH and outer PAH layers, preventing soot from crossing into oxidizer-rich regions, thus minimizing oxidation and maturation. (3) Numerical simulations show surface growth rates are slower in IJDF, with peak soot volume fractions an order of magnitude lower (∼10⁻⁹) than NJDF. This is supported by experimental observations where soot particles in IJDF are smaller (3–5 nm) and less carbonized, indicating incipient characteristics due to reduced thermal and chemical exposure.",

    "1": "The soot formation, evolution and morphology in inverse jet diffusion flame differ fundamentally from that of the normal jet diffusion flame (NJDF) due to its distinct reactant delivery mode and fluid dynamics.",
    "2": "In IJDF, the soot formation strongly depends on the air and fuel jet velocities. This is due to the fact that the incipient soot particles in the fuel-rich annular region are carried across the flame sheet by the high-velocity central air jet, which gives less residence time for the soot particles to stay in the high-temperature flame zone and hence inhibits their surface growth."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer is consistent with the two key mechanisms stated in the original text: (1) IJDF's distinct reactant delivery mode (central air, annular fuel) fundamentally alters soot formation, and (2) incipient soot particles are carried across the flame sheet by the high-velocity central air jet, reducing residence time and inhibiting surface growth. However, the answer contains many specific quantitative details (soot volume fractions, particle sizes, layer structures) that go well beyond what can be verified from the provided original text excerpts. Since the original text is limited to two sentences, I cannot verify these additional claims, though they appear physically plausible and logically consistent with combustion science principles. The core mechanisms are correctly explained and match the original text, so the answer is marked as correct, but verification confidence is medium due to inability to confirm the extensive additional details.",

It correctly states that soot is carried across the flame sheet but then incorrectly claims in point (2) that the flame structure prevents this crossing.
