  "question_text": "Quantitatively, how does the high-temperature absorption cross-section of ³NCN at 329.13 nm vary with temperature, and what physical principles underlie this temperature dependence?",
  "standard_answer": "The Doppler-limited absorption cross-section of triplet NCN at 329.13 nm decreases with increasing temperature, following the empirical relation σ(³NCN, 329.13 nm)(T) = 3.30 × 10⁻¹⁵ exp(-1.80 × 10⁻³ × T/K) cm², valid from 750 to 2500 K. This negative temperature dependence arises from the Boltzmann distribution of population among rovibrational states. At higher temperatures, the population spreads over more rotational and vibrational levels, reducing the fractional population in the specific ground state levels that contribute most to absorption at 329.13 nm. Specifically, the dominant absorption feature shifts from the (000)-(000) band at low temperatures to the (010)-(010) hot band at high temperatures, but the overall cross-section decreases due to the dilution of population across many states. The calculation involves partition functions and transition moments derived from spectroscopic constants and lifetime measurements, with the radiative lifetime of 183 ± 7 ns used to determine Einstein coefficients. Pressure broadening has a minor effect, causing only a ~6% reduction in peak cross-section from 0.05 to 0.1 MPa.",

The answer provides extensive additional technical details about specific band transitions, radiative lifetimes, and pressure effects that go well beyond the provided excerpts. While these details appear physically reasonable and consistent with spectroscopic principles, they cannot be verified against the provided original text. However, since the verifiable core facts are correct and the additional information does not contradict established spectroscopic principles, the answer is marked as correct.
