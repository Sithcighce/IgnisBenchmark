  "question_text": "How does the mode of arsenic occurrence in coal influence its volatilization behavior during combustion, and what are the general temperature ranges associated with the staged release of different arsenic species?",
  "standard_answer": "The mode of arsenic occurrence in coal significantly influences its volatilization behavior during combustion through differences in chemical bonding stability and thermal decomposition characteristics. Arsenic primarily exists in coal as pyritic (associated with iron sulfides), organic-bound, and arsenate (As5+) species. Organically bound arsenic is easily vaporized during the devolatilization stage at lower temperatures due to weaker molecular associations with carbon matrices. Arsenic bound to Fe-Mn oxides and pyrite is unstable and tends to vaporize at intermediate temperatures below 1000°C, primarily through decomposition or oxidation processes. Arsenates are very stable and usually decompose only at relatively high temperatures due to stronger chemical bonds. The staged release follows temperature-dependent patterns: arsenic that vaporizes below 600°C is mainly organically bound, while arsenic vaporized at 800-900°C is primarily due to the decomposition or oxidation of arsenic in sulfide forms. This explains why coals with high proportions of organic or pyritic arsenic show greater low-temperature volatilization, while arsenate-rich coals retain arsenic in ash until higher combustion temperatures are reached.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "It is generally accepted that exchangeable and organic-bound arsenic are easily vaporized during the devolatilization of coal, and arsenic bound to Fe–Mn oxides and pyrite is unstable and tends to vaporize at temperatures lower than 1000 °C, while arsenates are very stable and usually decompose at relatively high temperatures.",
    "2": "Liu et al. [62] concluded that arsenic that vaporized at lower than 600 °C was mainly organically bound, while arsenic vaporized at 800–900 °C was mainly due to the decomposition or oxidation of arsenic in sulfide forms."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text. It correctly identifies the three main arsenic species (pyritic/sulfide-associated, organic-bound, and arsenate), their relative thermal stabilities, and the temperature-dependent release patterns. The answer properly states that organic-bound arsenic vaporizes at lower temperatures during devolatilization, arsenic in Fe-Mn oxides and pyrite vaporizes below 1000°C, and arsenates are stable until higher temperatures. The specific temperature ranges cited (below 600°C for organic-bound, 800-900°C for sulfide forms) match the original text exactly. The chemical and thermodynamic principles regarding bond strength and thermal decomposition are correctly applied. While the answer is more detailed and explanatory than the original text, all additional elaborations (e.g., explaining the mechanism through 'weaker molecular associations with carbon matrices' and 'stronger chemical bonds') are scientifically sound and consistent with combustion chemistry principles. No factual errors or logical contradictions detected.",
