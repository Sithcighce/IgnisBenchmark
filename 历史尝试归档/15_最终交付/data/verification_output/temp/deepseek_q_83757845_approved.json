  "question_text": "Based on the review by Grégoire et al. (2025), what are the primary limitations of existing ammonium perchlorate (AP) gas-phase chemical kinetics mechanisms, and what specific improvements are needed to address these deficiencies according to the authors?",
  "standard_answer": "The primary limitation of existing AP gas-phase chemical kinetics mechanisms is their inadequate validation against fundamental experimental data, unlike the rigorous validation procedures common for hydrocarbon fuels in combustion science. The authors note that 'the few existing AP mechanisms have never been fully vetted against an applicable database of experimental results, certainly not in the manner that mechanisms are typically validated within the combustion science community for fuels such as hydrogen and various hydrocarbons.' This lack of systematic validation leads to significant performance gaps. Specific improvements needed include leveraging recent developments in ammonia oxidation chemistry modeling, as 'significant improvements in our ability to model the gas-phase chemical kinetics of AP combustion can be made by taking advantage of recent developments in ammonia oxidation chemistry modeling.' Additionally, the compilation of a comprehensive experimental database for both ammonia (NH₃) and perchloric acid (HClO₄) families is essential, along with addressing the scarcity of fundamental data for chlorine-based species and cross-system reactions involving nitrogen and chlorine chemistry to enable robust mechanism development.",
