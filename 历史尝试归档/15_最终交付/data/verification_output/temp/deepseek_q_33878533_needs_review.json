  "question_text": "What mechanisms cause deactivation of sulphonated resin catalysts in continuous biodiesel production, and how do impurities like metal ions and water exacerbate these effects through ion exchange and adsorption?",
  "standard_answer": "Deactivation of sulphonated resin catalysts in continuous biodiesel production arises from multiple mechanisms, primarily ion exchange with metal impurities and water adsorption. Metal ions (e.g., Fe³⁺, Na⁺, Ca²⁺) present in feedstocks undergo cation exchange with H⁺ sites on the resin, irreversibly replacing protons and reducing acidity. This is particularly severe at high alcohol:FFA ratios where increased viscosity enhances metal dispersion, promoting exchange. Water deactivation occurs through two pathways: (1) solvation of acid sites to form hydrated protons (-H₃O⁺-SO₃⁻), which are less reactive, and (2) physical adsorption in pores, blocking access to FFA molecules. Macroporous resins are more vulnerable due to their high surface area, as 'water causes the catalyst to deactivate (i.e. the water layer would prevent the access of acid and alcohol to the catalyst).' Additionally, water can hydrolyze esters, regenerating FFAs and shifting equilibrium backward. The paper notes that 'resins showing a permanent porous structure seem to deactivate more easily than gel-type resins, due to their greater capacity to adsorb the water,' and 'metal ions impurities (e.g., Fe+3) through metal exchange may be observed... particularly for high alcohol: FFA molar ratios.' Regeneration via acid washing can restore activity by displacing metals and removing water, but mechanical degradation from swelling/shrinking cycles further contributes to long-term deactivation.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the deactivation mechanisms of sulphonated resin catalysts. It correctly identifies: (1) ion exchange with metal ions (Fe³⁺, Na⁺, Ca²⁺) replacing H⁺ sites and reducing acidity, (2) water deactivation through solvation of acid sites and physical adsorption blocking pore access, and (3) greater vulnerability of macroporous resins compared to gel-type resins. All three key points from the original text are accurately incorporated with proper quotations. The answer also provides scientifically sound elaborations (e.g., hydrated protons being less reactive, water hydrolyzing esters, mechanical degradation from swelling/shrinking) that are consistent with established catalyst chemistry principles. The explanation of high alcohol:FFA ratios enhancing metal dispersion is a reasonable mechanistic interpretation. No factual errors, logical contradictions, or inconsistencies with the original text were found.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly identifies key deactivation mechanisms aligned with the ground truth: metal ion exchange on sulfonic acid sites and water adsorption forming a blocking layer, and it notes macroporous resins are more susceptible and that high alcohol:FFA ratios are associated with metal exchange. However, it contains a clear internal contradiction about the reversibility of ion exchange and introduces an implausible, unsupported explanation about viscosity at high alcohol ratios. These issues warrant marking the answer as incorrect despite overall alignment with the core points.",
