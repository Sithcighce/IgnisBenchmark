  "question_text": "According to the paper 'Progress in dynamic simulation of thermal power plants' by Alobaid et al., how does dynamic simulation contribute to reducing lifetime consumption in thermally stressed components during transient operations, and what specific applications does the paper mention for dynamic simulation in thermal power plants?",
  "standard_answer": "The paper by Alobaid et al. explains that dynamic simulation plays a crucial role in reducing lifetime consumption of thermally stressed components during transient operations by enabling feasibility checks of load changes and optimizing operating strategies. Specifically, dynamic simulation is used during the proposal stage of power plant projects to verify whether load changes according to customer requirements can be implemented without causing unacceptable lifetime consumption in thick-walled components. This is achieved by modeling transient temperature distributions and stress evolution, allowing engineers to identify and avoid operating conditions that lead to excessive thermal fatigue. Additionally, the paper notes that lower minimal load operation can reduce the number of shutdown/startup procedures, thereby decreasing the cumulative lifetime consumption of these components. The paper identifies several key applications of dynamic simulation in thermal power plants, including optimization of control structures, stress assessment for critical components, plant safety analysis during malfunctions, and improving flexibility for load changes and startup procedures across various technologies like combined-cycle, coal-fired, and nuclear power plants.",

It correctly explains that dynamic simulation is used at the proposal stage to check feasibility of load changes without unacceptable lifetime consumption in thick-walled components. It accurately describes the mechanism involving transient temperature distributions and stress evolution. The statement about lower minimal load reducing shutdown/startup procedures and lifetime consumption is consistent with the original text. The applications mentioned (optimization of control structures, stress assessment, plant safety analysis, and improving flexibility) align with the original text, though the answer adds reasonable context about combined-cycle, coal-fired, and nuclear power plants which is a valid elaboration.
