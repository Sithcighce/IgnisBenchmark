  "question_text": "How does pyrolysis temperature affect the yield and composition of tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO), and what are the underlying chemical mechanisms driving these changes?",
  "standard_answer": "Pyrolysis temperature critically influences TPO yield through competing decomposition and cracking mechanisms. At lower temperatures (300-400°C), primary pyrolysis dominates, breaking weaker bonds in rubber polymers like natural rubber (NR) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) to produce volatile hydrocarbons, maximizing liquid yield. As temperature increases to 500-600°C, secondary cracking becomes significant: longer hydrocarbon chains crack into lighter fractions, increasing gas yield at the expense of TPO. Specifically, alkenes and cycloalkenes formed during initial decomposition undergo Diels-Alder reactions and aromatization, converting to benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Above 600°C, extensive cracking reduces TPO yield further while increasing gas production and PAH content due to enhanced ring-opening and recyclization reactions. The optimal TPO yield typically peaks around 500°C, balancing primary decomposition and minimizing secondary cracking.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The existence of a distinct extremum (maximum) in TPO yield with pyrolysis temperature was noted by many researchers, including: Murillo et al. [89], Rombaldo et al. [104], D ũng et al. [108], Pradhan and Singh [50] and Luo and Feng [115].",
    "2": "As the reactor bed temperature increases, alkenes and cycloalkenes undergo a series of reactions such as the Diels-Alder reaction and aromatisation, forming benzene and its derivatives."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the temperature-dependent mechanisms of tyre pyrolysis oil production. It correctly identifies: (1) the existence of a maximum TPO yield with temperature (confirmed by original text [1]), (2) the transition from primary pyrolysis at lower temperatures to secondary cracking at higher temperatures, (3) specific chemical mechanisms including Diels-Alder reactions and aromatization forming benzene derivatives (confirmed by original text [2]), and (4) the formation of PAHs at higher temperatures. The answer correctly explains the competing mechanisms (primary decomposition vs. secondary cracking) and their effects on product distribution. The optimal temperature range around 500°C is consistent with the literature references cited in the original text. All physical and chemical principles stated are sound, and the causal relationships are logically correct. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or contradictions with the original text.",

          "Mechanistic phrasing: attributing increased PAH content to ‘ring-opening’ is imprecise; PAH growth is more associated with cyclization/aromatization/polymerization pathways (e.g., HACA), though this is a minor issue."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground truth on two key points: (1) TPO yield exhibits a maximum with temperature, and (2) alkenes/cycloalkenes undergo Diels–Alder reactions and aromatization to benzene derivatives at higher temperatures. However, it contains a logical/factual inconsistency by stating that liquid yield is maximized at 300–400°C while also asserting the peak near 500°C. This contradicts typical observed trends and undermines the answer’s correctness.",
