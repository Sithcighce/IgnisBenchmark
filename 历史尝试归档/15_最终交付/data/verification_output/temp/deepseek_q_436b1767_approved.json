  "question_text": "Analyze the competitive adsorption mechanism between CO and H₂ on platinum anode catalysts in PEM fuel cells, explaining how the difference in adsorption energies leads to performance degradation through site blocking and increased anode overpotential. Describe the key thermodynamic factors governing this competitive adsorption process based on the provided paper.",
  "standard_answer": "CO poisoning in PEMFCs occurs through competitive adsorption where CO molecules preferentially occupy active platinum sites due to their significantly higher heat of adsorption (134 kJ mol⁻¹) compared to H₂ (87.9 kJ mol⁻¹). This thermodynamic advantage allows CO to outcompete hydrogen for adsorption sites under normal anode operating potentials. The preferential adsorption of CO blocks active sites required for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), reducing the available surface area for hydrogen oxidation and increasing the anode overpotential, which consequently reduces the overall cell voltage. The magnitude of surface coverage by CO is determined by the competition between CO adsorption and/or re-adsorption processes, the electroreduction of CO₂, and CO removal through oxidation via the reactant pair mechanism. These competing processes establish a dynamic equilibrium that depends on operating conditions, with CO's stronger adsorption thermodynamics enabling it to dominate site occupation despite lower concentrations in the fuel stream.",

    "1": "CO competes with hydrogen for the active sites on the platinum under normal anode operating potentials. CO adsorbs on the Pt surface more easily than H₂ (heat of adsorption of CO on Pt is 134 kJ mol⁻¹, and for H₂ is 87.9 kJ mol⁻¹).",
    "2": "The magnitude of the surface covered by CO is determined by the CO adsorption and/or re-adsorption, the electroreduction of CO₂, and the CO removal through oxidation, which occurs through the reactant pair mechanism."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text. It correctly states: (1) CO's higher heat of adsorption (134 kJ/mol) vs H₂ (87.9 kJ/mol), (2) competitive adsorption mechanism where CO preferentially occupies Pt sites, (3) the consequence of site blocking leading to reduced HOR and increased anode overpotential, and (4) the dynamic equilibrium determined by CO adsorption/re-adsorption, CO₂ electroreduction, and CO oxidation via reactant pair mechanism. The answer provides appropriate elaboration on the performance degradation mechanism (reduced cell voltage) which logically follows from the original text's description. All thermodynamic principles are correctly stated, and the cause-effect relationships are sound. The additional detail about 'lower concentrations in fuel stream' is a reasonable inference consistent with CO poisoning literature and does not contradict the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The answer is factually correct and logically sound. It accurately uses the provided heats of adsorption (134 kJ/mol for CO vs. 87.9 kJ/mol for H₂) from the original text to explain why CO preferentially adsorbs on platinum. The causal chain—stronger adsorption leads to site blocking, which increases anode overpotential and reduces cell voltage—is a correct and fundamental explanation of CO poisoning. The answer also correctly incorporates the dynamic factors determining surface coverage as listed in the original text.",
