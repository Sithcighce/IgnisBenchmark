  "question_text": "How do the operating parameters in thermo-chemical processing of plastic waste influence heat and mass transfer mechanisms, and how can these parameters be manipulated to control product yield and selectivity toward specific chemicals and fuels?",
  "standard_answer": "The thermo-chemical processing of plastic waste involves complex heat and mass transfer phenomena that are governed by key operating parameters. Temperature directly affects the thermal energy available for bond cleavage, with higher temperatures promoting more extensive cracking but potentially leading to over-decomposition. Heating rate influences the thermal gradient within the plastic material, where rapid heating can minimize secondary reactions by quickly volatilizing primary products. Residence time controls the duration for which volatiles remain in the reaction zone, with shorter times preserving primary decomposition products while longer times promote secondary cracking and recombination reactions. The reaction medium (such as inert gas or steam) affects mass transfer by altering the diffusion environment and can participate in chemical reactions. Reactor type determines the dominant heat transfer mechanism - conduction in fixed beds, convection in fluidized beds, or mixed modes in screw pyrolyzers. Catalyst species modify both heat and mass transfer by providing alternative reaction pathways with lower activation energies. By strategically manipulating these parameters, the distribution of thermolytic products can be precisely tailored toward target chemicals like monomers, light olefins, and BTEX, or fuels including transportation fuels and syngas, despite the compositional complexity of plastic waste.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Precise control over yield and selectivity towards target chemicals (monomers, light olefins, and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers (BTEXs)) and fuels (transportation fuels and syngas) is achievable by manipulating operating parameters for the thermo-chemical platform despite the possibly marked influence of the waste composition on product distribution.",
    "2": "The distribution of resulting thermolytic products from plastic wastes can be precisely tailored by manipulating operating parameters (temperature, heating rate, residence time, reaction medium, reactor type, and catalyst species).",
    "3": "Section 7 highlights the pyrolytic conversion of plastic wastes into transportation fuels, such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and syngas. The technical strategies to attain higher yield and selectivity towards target or specific chemicals are described."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains how operating parameters influence heat and mass transfer in thermo-chemical processing of plastic waste. It accurately describes: (1) temperature effects on bond cleavage and decomposition, (2) heating rate influence on thermal gradients and secondary reactions, (3) residence time control over product distribution, (4) reaction medium effects on mass transfer and chemical reactions, (5) reactor type determining heat transfer mechanisms, and (6) catalyst effects on reaction pathways. The answer is consistent with the original text's assertion that product distribution can be precisely tailored by manipulating these parameters to achieve target chemicals (monomers, light olefins, BTEX) and fuels (transportation fuels, syngas). All physical and chemical principles stated are correct, including thermal decomposition kinetics, mass transfer phenomena, and catalytic mechanisms.

        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground truth by identifying key operating parameters (temperature, heating rate, residence time, reaction medium, reactor type, and catalyst species) and explaining how they influence heat/mass transfer and product distribution. It correctly describes cause-effect relationships (e.g., higher temperature promotes cracking, fast heating reduces secondary reactions, shorter residence times preserve primary products). It also matches the stated capability to tailor yields/selectivity toward monomers, light olefins, BTEX, transportation fuels, and syngas. Minor simplifications do not constitute factual errors.",
