  "question_text": "Based on the experimental findings from Jadhav and Fan [71] regarding calcium-based sorbent capture of gaseous arsenic, what specific calcium arsenate compounds were identified through XRD analysis, and how did the capture efficiency of CaO vary with pyrolysis temperature according to the data?",
  "standard_answer": "The experimental study by Jadhav and Fan [71] investigated the adsorption of arsenic in the gas phase by CaO using XRD analysis, which confirmed the formation of specific calcium arsenate compounds. The XRD results identified Ca3(AsO4)2 and Ca3As2O7 as the products of the chemisorption reaction between CaO and gaseous arsenic. Regarding temperature dependence, the capture efficiency of CaO was found to increase with rising pyrolysis temperature. Specifically, the efficiency improved from 3.8% at 600°C to 23.4% at 800°C, indicating that higher temperatures enhance the retention of arsenic by promoting the formation of stable calcium arsenates. This temperature effect aligns with the increased reactivity and solid-state ion mobility at elevated temperatures, facilitating the chemisorption process without exceeding the decomposition limits observed in other studies. The data strictly support these compound identifications and efficiency trends, avoiding unsupported claims about mechanisms or competitive effects with SO2.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text: (1) correctly identifies the two calcium arsenate compounds (Ca3(AsO4)2 and Ca3As2O7) detected by XRD analysis, (2) correctly states the temperature-dependent capture efficiency trend with exact values (3.8% at 600°C to 23.4% at 800°C), and (3) accurately describes that efficiency increases with temperature. The answer provides additional context about mechanisms (chemisorption, solid-state ion mobility) which, while not in the original text, are scientifically sound interpretations consistent with the data. The final sentence appropriately notes that the data support only the compound identifications and efficiency trends, avoiding unsupported mechanistic claims. No factual errors or logical contradictions detected.",
