  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain the varying co-removal efficiencies of air pollution control devices (APCDs) for VOCs (55.8-87.6%), PAHs (74.7-89.8%), and CPM (36.3-81.5%), focusing specifically on the removal mechanisms in SCR, WFGD, and WESP devices as supported by the cited evidence.",
  "standard_answer": "The varying co-removal efficiencies across APCDs stem from differences in pollutant physical properties and the dominant removal mechanisms in each device. For SCR systems operating at ~300°C, high VOC and PAH removal occurs primarily through catalytic oxidation where organic molecules undergo complete combustion to CO₂ and H₂O. As Citation 2 states: 'When the VOCs and PAHs in the flue gas move from the boiler into the SCR device, they will be oxidized into small molecular compounds such as CO₂ and H₂O, due to the higher temperature (~300°C) and the presence of a denitrification catalyst.' WFGD provides CPM removal through washout in desulfurization slurry, with Citation 3 specifically noting: 'The removal efficiency of WFGD and WESP for organic components in CPM was 32.5 % and 10.4 %, respectively. This is mainly attributed to the washing effect of WFGD and the dusting effect of WESP.' WESP offers additional CPM capture through dusting effects, though the efficiency remains lower than for larger particles. The fundamental differences in removal mechanisms - catalytic oxidation for VOCs and PAHs in SCR, and physical capture processes for CPM in WFGD and WESP - explain the efficiency variations across pollutant classes, with Citation 1 confirming the overall efficiency ranges: 'They can remove VOCs, PAHs, and CPM at efficiencies of 55.8–87.6 %, 74.7–89.8 %, and 36.3–81.5 %, respectively.'",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the varying co-removal efficiencies across APCDs based on the original text. It correctly identifies: (1) SCR operates at ~300°C with catalytic oxidation as the primary mechanism for VOCs and PAHs (supported by Citation 2), (2) WFGD removes CPM through washing effects and WESP through dusting effects (supported by Citation 3), (3) the efficiency ranges match Citation 1 exactly (55.8-87.6% for VOCs, 74.7-89.8% for PAHs, 36.3-81.5% for CPM). The answer correctly attributes the efficiency variations to differences in pollutant physical properties and removal mechanisms - catalytic oxidation for organic compounds in SCR versus physical capture for particulates in WFGD/WESP. All citations are properly integrated and the physical/chemical principles are sound. No factual errors or logical contradictions detected.",
