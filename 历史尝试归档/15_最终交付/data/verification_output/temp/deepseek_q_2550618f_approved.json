  "question_text": "How do alkali chlorides and sulfates contribute to the formation of alternating multi-layered slagging structures in biomass combustion systems, and what are the key deposition mechanisms involved?",
  "standard_answer": "Alkali chlorides and sulfates drive the formation of multi-layered slagging through their release as volatile species during combustion, followed by condensation and deposition mechanisms. Initially, KCl and K2SO4 aerosols form from volatile alkali metals and condense on heating surfaces via thermophoresis and turbulent diffusion, creating a sticky initial layer. This layer acts as an adhesive, capturing coarse fly ash particles through inertial impaction. Fine particles enriched in K, Na, Cl, and S are repeatedly deposited and enriched, while coarse particles with high Si and Al content are trapped, leading to alternating layers. The process is enhanced by chemical transformations such as sulfation of KCl to K2SO4, which reduces gaseous alkali concentrations but promotes aerosol formation. The alternating structure arises from cycles of fine-particle enrichment and coarse-particle capture, with the initial slagging layer being critical for bonding subsequent deposits to the surface.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Fine particles that contain high concentrations of K, Na, Cl, and S, in the forms of KCl and K3Na(SO4)2, are initially deposited and enriched on the heating surfaces; then, they trap coarse and large particles containing high Si, Al, and other elements.",
    "2": "The accumulation of submicron alkali metal ash particles and the capture of coarse ash particles result in the construction of an alternating overlapping multi-layered structure."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the multi-layered slagging formation mechanism and is consistent with the original text. It correctly identifies that fine particles enriched in K, Na, Cl, and S (as KCl and K2SO4/K3Na(SO4)2) are initially deposited, followed by capture of coarse particles with high Si and Al content, creating alternating layers. The answer provides additional mechanistic details (thermophoresis, turbulent diffusion, inertial impaction, sulfation reactions) that are scientifically sound and commonly accepted in combustion science. These elaborations do not contradict the original text but rather explain the underlying physical and chemical processes. The core mechanism - fine particle deposition followed by coarse particle capture leading to alternating multi-layered structures - is correctly presented and matches the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly describes that fine alkali salt particles (chlorides/sulfates) deposit first and subsequently trap coarse, Si/Al-rich particles, producing alternating multi-layered structures. The cited mechanisms—volatile release, condensation to aerosols, thermophoresis/turbulent diffusion for fine particles, and inertial impaction for coarse particles—are physically sound and consistent with the original text’s core message. The added note on sulfation of KCl to K2SO4 is reasonable and does not contradict the ground truth, though the original specifically mentions K3Na(SO4)2.",
