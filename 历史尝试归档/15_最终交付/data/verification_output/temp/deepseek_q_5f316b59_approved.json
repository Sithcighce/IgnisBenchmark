  "question_text": "In the context of high-temperature pyrolysis synthesis for single atom catalysts, explain the mechanistic role of strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) in preventing metal atom agglomeration at elevated temperatures, and describe how coordination site strategies create stable environments for isolated metal atoms during thermal processing.",
  "standard_answer": "Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) prevent metal atom agglomeration by creating favorable thermodynamic conditions that reduce the probability of atomic aggregation, which is a common challenge during SAC synthesis. The enhanced precursor-support interactions under high-temperature conditions create strong adhesive bonding between metal atoms and support materials, effectively anchoring individual atoms and preventing their migration and coalescence into clusters. Coordination site strategies function by assigning specific support sites with chemical linkers that adsorb or bind metal atoms through coordinate bonds. These chemical linkers create stable coordination environments that immobilize metal atoms and prevent their migration even under elevated thermal conditions. The combination of SMSI and coordination site engineering creates a dual stabilization mechanism where strong interfacial interactions work synergistically with chemical bonding to maintain atomic dispersion throughout high-temperature synthesis processes.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains both SMSI and coordination site strategies consistent with the original text. SMSI is correctly described as reducing aggregation probability through favorable thermodynamic conditions and strong adhesive bonding that anchors atoms and prevents migration/coalescence. Coordination site strategy is correctly explained as using chemical linkers to bind metal atoms through coordinate bonds, creating stable environments that immobilize atoms and prevent migration at high temperatures. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanisms (thermodynamic favorability, interfacial interactions, chemical bonding) while remaining factually consistent with the original text. The description of dual stabilization through synergistic effects is a reasonable inference from the combined mechanisms described in the original text. No factual errors, logical contradictions, or inconsistencies with established combustion/materials science principles are present.",
