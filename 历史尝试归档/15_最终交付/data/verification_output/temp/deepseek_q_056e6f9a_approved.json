  "question_text": "Calculate the energy efficiency of a tyre pyrolysis process producing TPO, given a tyre feedstock lower heating value (LHV) of 35 MJ/kg and TPO yield of 45% with LHV of 42 MJ/kg, considering only the liquid product energy output.",
  "standard_answer": "The energy efficiency based on TPO output is calculated as the ratio of energy in TPO to energy in the tyre feedstock. For 1 kg of tyre feedstock: Energy input = 35 MJ. TPO mass produced = 0.45 kg. Energy in TPO = 0.45 kg × 42 MJ/kg = 18.9 MJ. Energy efficiency = (18.9 MJ / 35 MJ) × 100% = 54%. This calculation assumes no energy recovery from gaseous or solid fractions, which would improve overall efficiency. In practice, pyrolysis processes often utilize gaseous products to power the reactor, achieving energy self-sustainability. The high LHV of TPO (42 MJ/kg) compared to diesel (∼45 MJ/kg) makes it a viable fuel, but the 54% efficiency highlights the importance of optimizing yield and leveraging by-products for comprehensive energy balance.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Pyrolysis process efficiency is high and feedstock for TPO is both available and flexible.",
    "2": "The gaseous fraction can be reused to power the pyrolytic reactor and make the process self-sustainable in energy terms."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly calculates the energy efficiency (54%) using sound thermodynamic principles: Energy efficiency = (TPO energy output / feedstock energy input) × 100% = (0.45 kg × 42 MJ/kg / 35 MJ) × 100% = 54%. The calculation is mathematically correct and logically sound. The answer appropriately notes that this calculation considers only liquid product output and acknowledges that gaseous and solid fractions could improve overall efficiency. The statement about gaseous products powering the reactor aligns with the original text's mention of process self-sustainability. The comparison of TPO LHV (42 MJ/kg) to diesel (~45 MJ/kg) is factually accurate. No contradictions with the original text exist - the answer elaborates on the efficiency calculation while remaining consistent with the original text's statements about high process efficiency and energy self-sustainability through gas reuse.",
