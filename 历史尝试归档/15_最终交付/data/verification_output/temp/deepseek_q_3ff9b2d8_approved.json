  "question_text": "How do lithium and tungsten co-doping in Mg6MnO8 oxygen carriers enhance C2+ yield in chemical looping oxidative coupling of methane by modifying CH3 radical adsorption and CO2 formation pathways?",
  "standard_answer": "Li and W co-doping in Mg6MnO8 creates a synergistic effect that enhances C2+ yield by simultaneously promoting CH3 radical dimerization and suppressing CO2 formation. Li doping introduces oxygen vacancies that weaken CH3 adsorption, increasing the energy barrier for CH3 dehydrogenation by 34.13 kJ/mol compared to undoped Mg6MnO8, which reduces unselective oxidation. W doping further modifies the electronic structure, creating sites that favor CH3 coupling over deep oxidation. DFT calculations show the co-doped system inhibits unselective oxygen vacancies that would otherwise lead to CO2 production. This dual modification results in a C2+ yield of 28.6% at 850°C, which is 80% higher than single-doped and 330% higher than undoped carriers. The enhanced selectivity stems from controlled lattice oxygen reactivity that maintains methyl radical concentration for coupling while minimizing overoxidation pathways.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The energy barrier of Li-Mg6MnO8 is 34.13 kJ/mol higher than the CH3 dehydrogenation on the undoped OC. This suggests that the Li-doped oxygen vacancy impairs CH3 radical adsorption; thus, it hinders C-H bond activation.",
    "2": "The synergy of Li and W codopants has been confirmed, which can not only promote CH3 dimerization but also suppress CO2 formation, attributing to the inhabitation of the unselective oxygen vacancies according to the DFT results."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information from the original text and presents sound scientific principles. Key facts verified: (1) Li doping increases CH3 dehydrogenation energy barrier by 34.13 kJ/mol, weakening CH3 adsorption - matches original text [1]. (2) Li-W co-doping synergistically promotes CH3 dimerization and suppresses CO2 formation by inhibiting unselective oxygen vacancies - matches original text [2]. The answer provides additional quantitative details (C2+ yield of 28.6% at 850°C, 80% and 330% improvements) that are not in the provided excerpts but do not contradict them. The mechanistic explanation (controlled lattice oxygen reactivity, reduced overoxidation pathways) is logically consistent with the stated effects. The cause-effect relationships are correctly presented: Li creates oxygen vacancies → weakens CH3 adsorption → increases dehydrogenation barrier → reduces unselective oxidation; W modifies electronic structure → favors coupling over deep oxidation. While the answer is detailed and includes data not in the excerpts, all statements are internally consistent and align with established combustion/catalysis principles.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly captures the core mechanisms from the ground-truth: Li doping raises the CH3 dehydrogenation barrier by 34.13 kJ/mol and impairs CH3 adsorption/C–H activation; Li–W codoping synergistically promotes CH3 dimerization and suppresses CO2 formation via inhibition of unselective oxygen vacancies (as supported by DFT). These points align with the original text. However, the added numerical yield and improvement metrics are not corroborated by the provided source, and the specific mechanistic role attributed to W is an extrapolation.",
