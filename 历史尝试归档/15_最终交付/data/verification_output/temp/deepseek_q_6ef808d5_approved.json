  "question_text": "How does the fuel injection strategy in RCCI combustion create reactivity stratification to control combustion phasing and heat release rate according to the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "RCCI combustion utilizes a dual-fuel injection strategy to establish controlled reactivity stratification that governs combustion behavior. A low reactivity fuel is typically introduced through port-fuel injection, creating a premixed background charge. The high reactivity fuel is then directly injected into the combustion chamber, with research showing that 'by altering the global charge reactivity in combination with one or more direct injections, complete control over the combustion phasing and HRR can be accomplished.' This strategic injection creates a fuel reactivity stratification gradient where regions near the direct injection sites have higher reactivity while areas farther away maintain lower reactivity. The paper emphasizes that 'RCCI combustion mode relies heavily on the fuel reactivity stratification gradient to achieve clean and efficient combustion.' This gradient enables sequential ignition initiation in high reactivity zones, which then propagates to lower reactivity regions, allowing precise management of the combustion process. The degree of stratification can be tailored through injection timing and quantity adjustments to optimize the heat release profile and maintain combustion stability across different engine operating conditions.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the RCCI fuel injection strategy and reactivity stratification mechanism. It correctly incorporates both key quotes from the original text: (1) that RCCI relies on fuel reactivity stratification gradient for clean and efficient combustion, and (2) that altering global charge reactivity with direct injections enables control over combustion phasing and HRR. The answer provides a sound technical explanation of the dual-fuel strategy (low reactivity fuel via port injection, high reactivity fuel via direct injection), correctly describes the resulting reactivity gradient, and accurately explains the sequential ignition mechanism. The physical principles are correct, the cause-effect relationships are logical, and there are no contradictions with the original text. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and consistent with established RCCI combustion science.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately describes RCCIâ€™s dual-fuel strategy: a low-reactivity premixed background (typically via port-fuel injection) combined with direct injections of a high-reactivity fuel to create a controlled reactivity stratification. It aligns with the ground-truth statements that RCCI relies on the reactivity gradient and that adjusting global charge reactivity together with DI can control phasing and HRR. The causal logic and thermophysical principles are sound, with only a minor phrasing nuance regarding ignition propagation.",
