  "question_text": "How does flue gas recirculation in oxy-fuel combustion systems affect mercury oxidation efficiency compared to air-fired conditions, considering the documented effects of SO₂ inhibition and mercury concentration changes?",
  "standard_answer": "In oxy-fuel combustion with flue gas recirculation, mercury oxidation efficiency decreases compared to air-fired conditions due to two key documented effects. First, the recirculation process concentrates mercury in the flue gas, with mercury concentration in oxy-fuel combustion case with 72.1% flue gas recycle being approximately two times higher than that in air-firing case. Second, during flue gas recirculation, the high-concentration SO₂ inhibits the transformation of Hg⁰ to Hg²⁺ and Hgₚ. The mechanism involves SO₂ competing with mercury for available oxidants and potentially reducing oxidized mercury back to elemental form. In air-fired conditions, nitrogen dilution maintains lower SO₂ partial pressures, allowing more effective mercury oxidation. The combined effect of higher mercury concentration and enhanced SO₂ inhibition through recirculation leads to reduced overall oxidation efficiency despite the potentially favorable chlorine chemistry in oxy-fuel environments.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly addresses all key points from the original text and demonstrates sound understanding of the mechanisms. It accurately states that: (1) mercury concentration in oxy-fuel with 72.1% recycle is approximately 2x higher than air-firing [matches original text [1]], (2) high-concentration SO₂ during recirculation inhibits Hg⁰ to Hg²⁺ and Hgₚ transformation [matches original text [2]], (3) the mechanism involves SO₂ competing for oxidants and potentially reducing oxidized mercury (reasonable elaboration consistent with known chemistry), and (4) nitrogen dilution in air-fired conditions maintains lower SO₂ partial pressures (correct physical principle). The answer also correctly concludes that these combined effects lead to reduced oxidation efficiency in oxy-fuel systems. While the answer is detailed and includes some elaboration beyond the original text (e.g., chlorine chemistry mention, competition mechanism details), all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with combustion chemistry principles. The answer directly addresses the question's focus on comparing oxy-fuel to air-fired conditions considering SO₂ inhibition and mercury concentration changes.",

        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the provided ground-truth points: (1) oxy-fuel with flue gas recirculation yields about double the Hg concentration relative to air-firing at 72.1% FGR, and (2) high SO2 in recirculated flue gas inhibits Hg0 oxidation to Hg2+ and particulate Hg. It logically concludes that these effects reduce mercury oxidation efficiency in oxy-fuel FGR relative to air-firing. Additional mechanistic context (SO2 competition for oxidants and possible reduction pathways) is reasonable and does not contradict the original text.",

It accurately incorporates both points from the original text: the concentration of mercury due to flue gas recirculation (FGR) and the inhibition of mercury oxidation by the consequently higher SO₂ concentration. The provided mechanistic explanation for SO₂ inhibition (competition for oxidants and potential reduction of Hg²⁺) is consistent with established combustion chemistry principles. The overall conclusion that oxidation efficiency decreases is well-supported by the premises.",
