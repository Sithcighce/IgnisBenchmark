  "question_text": "Derive the mathematical relationship between the heatfunction H and the total heat transfer rate for forced convection over a flat plate, explaining how the boundary condition H(1,0) relates to the Nusselt number.",
  "standard_answer": "For forced convection over a flat plate with length L, the dimensionless heatfunction H(X,Y) satisfies ∂H/∂Y = f'θ and -∂H/∂X = 1/2X^(-1/2)(ηf' - f)θ - (1/Pr)∂θ/∂η, where f is the Blasius function and θ is dimensionless temperature. The analytical solution gives H(X,η) = X^(1/2)[f(η)θ(η) + (1/2Pr)θ'(η)]. At the wall (Y=0, η=0), H(X,0) = (1/2Pr)θ'(0)X^(1/2). The total heat transfer rate Q_total to the plate equals the dimensional heatfunction value at the downstream edge: h(1,0) = ρCpU∞(T∞-T0)LRe_L^(-1/2)H(1,0). Since the average Nusselt number Nu = Q_totalL/[k(T∞-T0)], substituting gives Nu = H(1,0)PrRe_L^(1/2). For Pr>0.5, H(1,0) = 0.664Pr^(-2/3), yielding Nu = 0.664Re_L^(1/2)Pr^(1/3), which matches the classical Blasius solution. This demonstrates that the heatfunction boundary value directly quantifies the overall heat transfer performance.",
