  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, how do temperature, pressure, and coal particle size affect the formation and emission characteristics of organic pollutants during coal pyrolysis and combustion, and what are the specific mechanisms and quantitative relationships described?",
  "standard_answer": "The paper provides specific evidence about how pyrolysis and combustion conditions affect organic pollutant formation. Temperature significantly influences VOC release patterns - the paper states that 'The VOCs were mainly released between 300°C and 600°C' with alkanes, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and phenols showing distinct temperature-dependent release profiles. Pressure has a measurable impact on organic matter yield, as 'increasing the pressure from 0.1 MPa to 5 MPa reduced the amount of released organic matter, but the total output of coke was increased.' This indicates that higher pressure suppresses volatile release while promoting char formation through enhanced repolymerization reactions. Coal particle size affects the composition of released organics - the paper notes that 'coal with large particles (0.9-1 mm) released more monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and PAHs than small coal pulverized particles (120-140 μm), and the content of aliphatic compounds was lower.' This suggests that larger particles experience different thermal gradients and residence times that favor aromatic compound formation over aliphatic species. The mechanisms involve competing thermal decomposition pathways where temperature governs bond cleavage energetics, pressure affects vapor residence time and secondary reactions, and particle size influences heat transfer rates and internal temperature profiles during devolatilization.",

    "1": "The VOCs were mainly released between 300°C and 600°C, as shown in Fig. 9. With increase in temperature within this temperature range, the alkanes (CnH2n+2, n > 1) and aromatic hydrocarbon (BTEX) reached a maximum value at around 520°C, whereas the concentration of the CH4 reached its maximum value closer to 600°C.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text. It correctly states: (1) VOCs release between 300-600°C with temperature-dependent profiles, (2) pressure increase from 0.1 to 5 MPa reduces organic matter release while increasing coke output, and (3) larger coal particles (0.9-1 mm) release more MAHs and PAHs with lower aliphatic content compared to smaller particles (120-140 μm). The mechanistic explanations provided (thermal decomposition pathways, pressure effects on vapor residence time and secondary reactions, particle size effects on heat transfer and temperature profiles) are scientifically sound and consistent with established combustion science principles. While the answer is detailed and includes interpretive mechanisms beyond the direct quotes, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately captures the key quantitative trends: VOCs mainly released between 300–600°C; increased pressure (0.1→5 MPa) suppresses volatile organics and increases coke; larger particles emit more MAHs and PAHs with lower aliphatic content. Mechanistic interpretations (bond cleavage with temperature, pressure-enhanced secondary reactions/repolymerization, particle-size-driven heat transfer and residence time effects) are reasonable and consistent with combustion/pyrolysis principles. Minor overreach occurs by referencing alkenes and phenols explicitly, which the provided text does not mention, and it omits the stated peak temperatures for specific species. Overall, no factual contradictions or logical errors.",
