  "question_text": "Calculate the thermal efficiency of a conventional parabolic trough collector operating at a mean absorber temperature of 400°C with ambient at 25°C, given an optical efficiency of 75%, concentration ratio of 30, direct beam irradiation of 800 W/m², and thermal loss coefficient of 10 W/m²K. Explain the impact of each parameter on efficiency.",
  "standard_answer": "Using the thermal efficiency formula: η_th = η_opt,max·K(θ) - [U_L·(T_r - T_am)] / (C·G_b). Assume K(θ) = 1 for normal incidence. Convert temperatures to Kelvin: T_r = 400 + 273 = 673 K, T_am = 25 + 273 = 298 K. Substitute values: η_th = 0.75 * 1 - [10 * (673 - 298)] / (30 * 800) = 0.75 - [10 * 375] / 24000 = 0.75 - 3750 / 24000 = 0.75 - 0.15625 = 0.59375 or 59.375%. Parameters impact: Optical efficiency (η_opt,max) directly increases η_th proportionally; a 1% increase in η_opt,max raises η_th by ~1%. Concentration ratio (C) reduces the denominator, lessening the relative effect of thermal losses; doubling C decreases the loss term by half. Thermal loss coefficient (U_L) linearly increases losses; halving U_L (e.g., to 5 W/m²K) would increase η_th to 0.75 - (5*375)/24000 = 0.75 - 0.078125 = 67.1875%. Temperature difference (T_r - T_am) magnifies losses; a 50 K reduction in T_r boosts η_th to 0.75 - [10*(623-298)]/24000 = 0.75 - 3250/24000 = 0.6146 or 61.46%. Solar irradiation (G_b) inversely affects the loss term; higher G_b dilutes losses, improving η_th. Thus, optimizing these parameters is crucial for high-temperature operation.",

All calculations are accurate: temperature conversions (400°C = 673 K, 25°C = 298 K), substitution of values (0.75 - [10×375]/24000 = 0.59375 or 59.375%), and the final result. The parameter impact analysis is physically sound: optical efficiency has direct proportional effect, concentration ratio reduces relative thermal losses, thermal loss coefficient linearly increases losses, temperature difference magnifies losses, and solar irradiation dilutes losses. All numerical examples for parameter variations are correctly calculated (e.g., halving U_L to 5 W/m²K yields 67.1875%, reducing T_r by 50 K yields 61.46%). The answer demonstrates proper understanding of solar collector thermodynamics and is fully consistent with the original text.",
