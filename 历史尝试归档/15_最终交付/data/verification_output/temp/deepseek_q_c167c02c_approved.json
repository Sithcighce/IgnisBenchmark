  "question_text": "Based on the 2020 review paper by Gao et al., what specific research gaps were identified regarding catalyst development for sewage sludge thermochemical conversion processes, and how do these gaps relate to process intensification and energy recovery? Provide a detailed analysis of the catalyst-related challenges mentioned in the paper.",
  "standard_answer": "According to the 2020 review paper by Gao et al., the primary research gaps in catalyst development for sewage sludge thermochemical conversion focus on three key areas that directly impact process intensification and energy recovery. First, there is a significant need for more research on catalyst selectivity toward targeted desired end-products, which is crucial for optimizing the quality and composition of outputs from pyrolysis and gasification processes. Second, the paper identifies that optimization of parametric conditions requires further investigation to enhance process efficiency and energy recovery. Third, the development of innovative reactor technologies that effectively integrate catalytic functions represents another major research gap. These catalyst-related challenges are directly tied to the paper's emphasis on promoting environmental sustainability through process intensification and energy recovery from pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion processes involving catalyst use. The selection and design of catalysts are identified as vital for enhancing the selectivity of thermochemical pyrolysis or gasification processes, but current limitations in these areas prevent optimal energy recovery and process intensification. The paper specifically notes that addressing these gaps would enable better control over product distribution and improve the overall efficiency of energy recovery systems from sewage sludge treatment.",
