  "question_text": "Explain how vapor retention time and pressure influence char yield during cellulose pyrolysis through secondary charring reactions, based on the provided paper content.",
  "standard_answer": "Secondary charring reactions play a crucial role in determining char yield during cellulose pyrolysis by converting primary volatiles into additional char. The extent of these reactions is strongly influenced by vapor retention time and pressure conditions. When the retention time of volatiles in the solid matrix is increased, secondary reactions are promoted, leading to higher char yield. This occurs because longer residence times allow more primary tars to undergo secondary decomposition reactions that form additional char. Pressure also significantly affects char yield through its impact on secondary reactions. At lower pressures, fewer secondary reactions take place, which reduces the char yield. This pressure effect is attributed to reduced molecular collision frequency and altered reaction kinetics under vacuum conditions. The combined influence of retention time and pressure demonstrates that char yield is not solely determined by temperature but is governed by transport limitations and reaction conditions that control the extent of secondary charring processes.",

    "1": "Secondary charring reactions can be produced at the same place as primary pyrolysis or when the volatiles leave the particle.",
    "2": "When the retention time of the volatiles in the solid matrix is increased, secondary reactions are promoted increasing the char yield.",
    "3": "At lower pressures, fewer secondary reactions take place, reducing the char yield."
