  "question_text": "How do the fundamental combustion characteristics of ammonia affect flame stabilization strategies in gas turbine combustors, and what specific design modifications are required?",
  "standard_answer": "The fundamental combustion characteristics of ammonia necessitate significant modifications to conventional gas turbine flame stabilization strategies. Ammonia's low laminar burning velocity (<0.010 m/s), high ignition energy (2-3 orders magnitude higher than hydrocarbons), and narrow flammability limits (18-28% fuel mole fraction) challenge standard swirl-stabilized combustion approaches. These characteristics require enhanced recirculation zones with higher swirl numbers to increase residence time for complete combustion. The high auto-ignition temperature (930 K) demands higher preheat temperatures or pilot flames for reliable ignition. Additionally, the formation of NOx through both thermal and fuel-bound nitrogen pathways requires careful management of flame temperature distributions. Combustor designs must incorporate staged fuel injection to control local equivalence ratios and temperature peaks, potentially using rich-quench-lean configurations. The paper notes that 'ammonia blends have been assessed and compared to conventional and higher hydrocarbon fuels' in terms of Wobbe Index, indicating that fuel delivery systems may need modification to account for different volumetric flow requirements. Advanced mixing systems with finer atomization and enhanced turbulence generation are essential to overcome ammonia's slow chemical kinetics and ensure stable operation across the load range while minimizing unburned ammonia and NOx emissions.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information from the original text and applies sound combustion engineering principles. Key facts are correctly stated: ammonia's low laminar burning velocity (<0.010 m/s, consistent with 'more than four times less than methane'), high ignition energy (2-3 orders of magnitude higher than hydrocarbons), and high auto-ignition temperature (930 K). The answer correctly identifies the narrow flammability limits (18-28% fuel mole fraction) as a challenge, which is consistent with ammonia's known combustion characteristics. The proposed design modifications (enhanced recirculation zones, higher swirl numbers, staged fuel injection, rich-quench-lean configurations) are logical engineering responses to the stated fundamental characteristics. The discussion of NOx formation through thermal and fuel-bound nitrogen pathways is accurate for ammonia combustion. While the answer is detailed and goes beyond the minimal information in the original text, all statements are factually correct and logically sound. The additional technical details about combustor design strategies are appropriate elaborations that don't contradict the original text.",

          "States flammability limits as 18–28% NH3; commonly cited LFL is closer to 15–16% at ambient, so 18% is likely too high.",
          "Mentions 'finer atomization' as a design need; this is not applicable if ammonia is supplied as a gaseous fuel (premixing/mixing enhancement would be more accurate).",
          "Refers to a paper on Wobbe Index comparisons without citation; while generally true that ammonia’s Wobbe Index drives injector/flow modifications, this specific reference is not verifiable from the provided ground-truth text."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground-truth points: ammonia has a high autoignition temperature (~930 K), requires much higher ignition energy (2–3 orders of magnitude above hydrocarbons), and has a very low laminar burning velocity (<0.010 m/s). It logically connects these properties to needed combustor modifications: stronger recirculation/higher swirl to increase residence time, higher preheat or pilot flames for reliable ignition, and staged/rich-quench-lean strategies to manage NOx from fuel-N and thermal pathways. The only issues are minor: slightly off flammability lower limit, an arguably inapplicable note on atomization for gaseous fueling, and an uncited Wobbe Index remark. Overall, the technical content and causal reasoning are sound and consistent with the provided ground truth.",
