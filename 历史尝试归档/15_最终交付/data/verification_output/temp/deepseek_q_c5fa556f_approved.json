  "question_text": "How do the competing requirements of spatial resolution and computational cost influence the choice between pore-scale modeling and continuum-scale modeling for reactive transport in porous electrodes?",
  "standard_answer": "The choice between pore-scale and continuum-scale modeling involves trade-offs between resolution of microstructural effects and computational feasibility. Pore-scale modeling explicitly resolves complex pore geometries and interfacial phenomena, providing detailed distributions of concentration, potential, and reaction rates at the triple-phase boundaries. This enables direct investigation of structure-performance relationships and identification of local transport limitations. However, it requires high-resolution digital structures from imaging techniques like XCT or FIB-SEM and computationally intensive simulations. Continuum-scale modeling uses volume-averaged equations with effective parameters (permeability, tortuosity, effective reaction rates) that lump microstructural effects, making it computationally efficient for engineering-scale simulations. But it cannot capture local heterogeneities, interfacial transport resistances, or the effects of pore morphology on reaction distribution. For reactive transport in porous electrodes, pore-scale modeling is essential when interfacial processes dominate (e.g., in low-catalyst-loading fuel cells) or when designing optimized microstructures, while continuum models suffice for system-level optimization where averaged behavior is sufficient. The decision depends on whether the research objective requires understanding fundamental mechanisms or predicting macroscopic performance.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Pore-scale modeling is an efficient tool for the simulation of pore-scale transport and reactions in porous media because of its ability to accurately characterize these processes and to provide the distribution details of important variables",
    "2": "Continuum-scale models have been widely adopted for predicting large-scale transport processes which are of interest in the engineering field. However, since the average length of a computational element in the continuum-scale models is usually much larger than the typical pore size of a porous medium, the microscale heterogeneity of porous media is neglected"

It correctly states that pore-scale modeling provides detailed distribution of variables and accurately characterizes transport/reaction processes (consistent with original text [1]), while continuum-scale models use volume-averaged equations and neglect microscale heterogeneity (consistent with original text [2]). The answer appropriately elaborates on computational costs, resolution capabilities, and application contexts (e.g., triple-phase boundaries, fuel cells) which are logical extensions consistent with combustion science and electrochemistry principles. No factual errors or contradictions with the original text were identified. The additional details about imaging techniques (XCT, FIB-SEM), effective parameters (permeability, tortuosity), and decision criteria based on research objectives are all scientifically sound and represent reasonable elaboration beyond the original text.",
