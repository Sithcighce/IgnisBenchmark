  "standard_answer": "Shock wave reflection-induced detonation (SWRID) is a key mechanism for detonation initiation in super-knock, occurring under high energy density conditions. The process begins with pre-ignition or an initial auto-ignition event, causing rapid heat release and generating a pressure wave. This wave propagates at acoustic speeds and reflects off combustion chamber walls, doubling in amplitude due to the impedance mismatch. The reflected shock compresses the near-wall unburned mixture adiabatically, significantly raising its temperature and pressure. This compression drastically shortens the ignition delay of the end gas through increased collision frequencies and activation of high-temperature kinetic pathways. If the energy density is sufficient, the compressed mixture auto-ignites almost instantaneously, forming a reactive shock front that couples with the pressure wave, transitioning to a detonation wave. This detonation propagates supersonically, characterized by Chapman-Jouguet velocities, and produces extreme pressure peaks (e.g., over 10.5 MPa) and oscillations. SWRID is favored in boosted engines where pre-ignition provides the initial energy release, and wall reflections focus the shock energy, making near-wall regions critical for detonation onset. This mechanism explains why super-knock often causes severe engine damage near walls.",

    "2": "Compared to the effect of shock compression and negative temperature coefficient (NTC) combustion on ignition delay, shock wave reflection is the main cause of near-wall auto-ignition/detonation."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the SWRID mechanism and is consistent with the original text. It correctly identifies SWRID as the most frequently observed detonation initiation mode and properly emphasizes that shock wave reflection is the main cause of near-wall auto-ignition/detonation (not just shock compression or NTC effects). The physical principles are sound: pressure wave generation from pre-ignition, acoustic propagation, amplitude doubling upon wall reflection due to impedance mismatch, adiabatic compression raising temperature/pressure, shortened ignition delay, and transition to detonation. The cause-effect relationships are correct, and the explanation of why near-wall regions are critical aligns with the original text's emphasis on shock wave reflection as the main cause. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with established combustion science.",

          "States the initial pressure wave propagates at acoustic speeds; in SWRID the incident disturbance is often a finite-amplitude compression that steepens into a shock, so 'acoustic' can be misleading.",
          "Says the reflected wave 'doubles in amplitude'; in linear acoustics the reflected amplitude equals the incident and doubling occurs at the wall due to superposition, not necessarily in the reflected wave itself.",
          "Describes shock compression as 'adiabatic'; shock processes are non-isentropic (though heat transfer is negligible), so phrasing could be refined."

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains that shock wave reflection at the wall compresses and heats the near-wall unburned mixture, shortens ignition delay, triggers near-wall auto-ignition, and couples a reactive front with the shock to form a detonationâ€”consistent with the ground truth that SWRID is the primary mode and reflection is the main cause of near-wall auto-ignition/detonation.
