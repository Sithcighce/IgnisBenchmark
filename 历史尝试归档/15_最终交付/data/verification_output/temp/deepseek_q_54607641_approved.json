  "question_text": "For a dodecane/nitrogen system at P_∞=100 bar, with fuel injected at T_F=450 K and coflow at T_O=1000 K, describe the persistence and evolution of the transcritical interface downstream of the injector orifice. Explain the thermodynamic principles that enable surface tension to persist at these high pressures and how the interface eventually vanishes at the supercriticalization edge.",
  "standard_answer": "In the dodecane/nitrogen system at P_∞=100 bar, a transcritical interface forms between the fuel and coflow streams despite the high pressure because of the intrinsic diffusional instability resulting from mixing the two propellant streams. This diffusional instability leads to separation of the propellants by a transcritical interface that bears large composition gradients and is accompanied by surface tension. The interface persists downstream of the injection orifice over distances comparable to the characteristic thermal-entrance length of the fuel stream. As the fuel stream is heated by the hot coflow, the mixture approaches the diffusional critical point of the system. The interface terminates at an edge located at a supercriticalization distance x = L_TR, where the flow attains fully supercritical conditions. At this edge, the interface vanishes, surface tension disappears, and the propellants mix by molecular diffusion across a growing compositional mixing layer. The structure of the edge reveals the crucial role played by the diffusional critical point in supercriticalizing the system. The evolution of the surface-tension coefficient along the transcritical interface shows a gradual decrease as the mixture approaches the supercritical region, eventually reaching zero at the interface edge where phase coexistence ceases to exist.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the transcritical interface phenomenon in the dodecane/nitrogen system. It correctly identifies that surface tension persists at high pressure due to diffusional instability from mixing the two propellant streams, which is consistent with the original text [1]. The answer properly describes the interface evolution, including the thermal-entrance length concept, heating by coflow, approach to the diffusional critical point, and termination at the supercriticalization edge (x = L_TR). The explanation that the interface vanishes at an edge giving rise to a fully supercritical mixing layer matches the original text [2]. The thermodynamic principles are correctly stated: large composition gradients accompany surface tension, the diffusional critical point plays a crucial role in supercriticalization, and surface tension gradually decreases to zero where phase coexistence ceases. All physical mechanisms, cause-effect relationships, and logical flow are sound. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or contradictions with the original text.",
