  "question_text": "How does the use of molten media in methane pyrolysis reactors enhance heat transfer and prevent carbon deposition, and what specific operational advantages does this provide according to the cited research?",
  "standard_answer": "Molten media reactors in methane pyrolysis utilize liquid metals like tin as both catalyst and heat transfer medium, enabling efficient thermal management. The high thermal conductivity of molten tin facilitates rapid heat distribution to methane bubbles as they rise through the column. This effective heat transfer between the molten medium and entrained CH₄ leads to constant recurrence of gas bubbles, which prevents the deposition of carbon on catalyst surfaces. The buoyancy-driven bubble dynamics cause carbon particles to separate from the molten medium and float to the surface, where they can be continuously removed. Liquid tin's suitability as a heat transfer medium allows for operation temperatures exceeding 1,200°C, enabling high conversion rates while maintaining stable temperature control. This continuous carbon separation mechanism prevents reactor clogging and eliminates the need for periodic shutdowns required in other reactor configurations where carbon accumulates on surfaces.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Liquid tin turned out to be a suitable heat transfer medium, because it allows for operation temperatures of more than 1,200 °C [95,125].",
    "2": "Effective heat transfer occurs between the molten medium and the entrained CH4 that leads to constant recurrence of gas bubbles and prevents the deposition of carbon on the catalyst [138]."

Key points verified: (1) Liquid tin as heat transfer medium enabling >1,200°C operation is correctly stated per [1]. (2) Effective heat transfer between molten medium and CH4 leading to bubble recurrence and preventing carbon deposition on catalyst is correctly stated per [2]. The answer provides additional mechanistically sound details about bubble dynamics, carbon separation via buoyancy, and operational advantages (preventing clogging, eliminating shutdowns) that are logical extensions of the stated mechanisms and consistent with combustion/thermophysics principles.

However, it contains a factual error by labeling tin as a catalyst and adds several operational claims (continuous removal, no shutdowns, high conversion rates) not supported by the provided citations.
