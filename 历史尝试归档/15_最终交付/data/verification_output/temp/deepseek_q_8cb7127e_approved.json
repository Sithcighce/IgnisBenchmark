  "question_text": "How does the reaction zone Péclet number (PeRZ) capture the similarity of monotonic MIE transition across different ignition sources, turbulent flows, and fuel types?",
  "standard_answer": "The reaction zone Péclet number (PeRZ) is defined as the ratio of small-scale turbulence diffusivity to reaction zone thermal diffusivity, which effectively characterizes the competition between turbulent mixing and thermal diffusion in the flame kernel. In monotonic MIE transition, PeRZ serves as a unifying parameter because it scales the turbulent strain effects relative to the chemical reaction timescale. When PeRZ is low (indicating dominant thermal diffusion over turbulent mixing), the flame kernel develops similarly to laminar conditions, and MIET increases gradually with turbulence. As PeRZ exceeds a critical value, turbulent mixing disrupts the reaction zone structure, leading to exponential increases in MIET due to enhanced heat and mass losses. This scaling holds regardless of ignition source (electrode vs. laser), flow configuration, or fuel type because PeRZ intrinsically accounts for the turbulence-chemistry interaction, making it a universal descriptor for the transition from flamelet to distributed combustion regimes.",

    "1": "In particular, the ratio of small-scale turbulence diffusivity to reaction zone thermal diffusivity, a reaction zone P ́eclet number, captures the similarity of monotonic MIE transition, regardless of different ignition sources (conventional electrodes versus laser), turbulent flows, pressure, and fuel types.",
    "2": "The monotonic MIE transition was first reported between two distinct modes on spark ignition in near-isotropic turbulence of methane-air mixtures with Le ~1 depending on a critical turbulent Karlovitz number (Kac) [24,60,61], where Kac ≈ 8–26 depending on φ with the minimum Kac ≈ 8 occurring near φ = 1 [61]."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains how PeRZ captures the similarity of monotonic MIE transition. It accurately describes PeRZ as the ratio of small-scale turbulence diffusivity to reaction zone thermal diffusivity, which matches the original text. The explanation of the physical mechanism is sound: low PeRZ corresponds to thermal diffusion dominance (laminar-like behavior with gradual MIET increase), while high PeRZ indicates turbulent mixing disruption of the reaction zone (exponential MIET increase). The answer correctly identifies that this scaling is universal across ignition sources, flow configurations, and fuel types because PeRZ intrinsically captures turbulence-chemistry interaction. The description of the transition from flamelet to distributed combustion regimes is consistent with established combustion theory. While the answer provides more mechanistic detail than the original text, all statements are physically accurate and logically consistent.",
