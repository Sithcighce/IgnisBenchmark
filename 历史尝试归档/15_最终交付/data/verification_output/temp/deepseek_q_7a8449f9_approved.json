  "question_text": "Calculate the approximate energy required to pyrolyze 1 kg of waste tire rubber from 25°C to 500°C, assuming an average specific heat capacity of 1.5 kJ/kg·K for the rubber and a heat of pyrolysis of 500 kJ/kg. How does this energy compare to the higher heating value (HHV) of tire char (∼23 MJ/kg)?",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate the energy required for pyrolysis, we consider the sensible heat to raise the temperature and the heat of pyrolysis for decomposition. Sensible heat Q_sensible = m * c_p * ΔT = 1 kg * 1.5 kJ/kg·K * (500 - 25) K = 712.5 kJ. Heat of pyrolysis Q_pyrolysis = m * ΔH_pyrolysis = 1 kg * 500 kJ/kg = 500 kJ. Total energy Q_total = Q_sensible + Q_pyrolysis = 712.5 + 500 = 1212.5 kJ or 1.2125 MJ. The HHV of tire char is about 23 MJ/kg, which is significantly higher than the energy input (1.2125 MJ), indicating that the pyrolysis process is energy-efficient, as the char's energy content is nearly 19 times the required input. This favorable energy balance highlights the potential of tire pyrolysis for net energy recovery, though practical systems must account for heat losses and reactor efficiency.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly calculates the energy required for pyrolysis using proper thermodynamic principles. Sensible heat calculation (712.5 kJ) and heat of pyrolysis (500 kJ) are correctly computed and summed to 1212.5 kJ (1.2125 MJ). The comparison with HHV of tire char (23 MJ/kg from original text, cited as ~23 MJ/kg in answer) is accurate, and the ratio calculation (~19 times) is correct (23/1.2125 ≈ 19). The conclusion about energy efficiency and favorable energy balance is logically sound. The answer appropriately notes practical considerations regarding heat losses and reactor efficiency. All physical principles are correctly applied, and there are no contradictions with the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the principles of thermophysics to calculate the total energy required for pyrolysis. The calculation is broken down into sensible heat (Q = m*c_p*ΔT) and the heat of pyrolysis (Q = m*ΔH_pyrolysis), and both components are calculated correctly. The total energy is then accurately compared to the higher heating value (HHV) of the char, which is consistent with the value provided in the original text (~23 MJ/kg vs 23.69 MJ/kg). The reasoning and conclusions drawn about the energy balance are sound and factually correct.",
