  "question_text": "How does the Biot number influence heat transfer control in torrefaction reactors, and what are the implications for reactor design and particle size selection?",
  "standard_answer": "The Biot number (Bi = hL/k) determines whether heat transfer is controlled by internal conduction or external convection in torrefaction reactors. When Bi << 1, external convection dominates, and particles heat uniformly, making kinetics the rate-limiting step. When Bi >> 1, internal conduction resistance prevails, leading to significant temperature gradients and potential thermal overshoot. For torrefaction, Bi values close to 1 indicate balanced internal and external resistances, optimizing heat transfer efficiency. This has critical implications for reactor design: for small particles (<2 mm), Bi is low, enabling rapid heating and uniform torrefaction, suitable for fluidized beds with high convective coefficients. For large particles, Bi increases, necessitating longer residence times or higher temperatures to achieve uniform treatment, which is typical in moving bed or rotary kiln reactors. The paper highlights that 'for smaller biomass particles (<2 mm), torrefaction is free from heat and mass transfer limitations,' whereas larger particles require careful design to manage thermal gradients. Thus, selecting particle size and reactor type based on Biot number ensures efficient energy use and consistent product quality, avoiding issues like incomplete torrefaction or over-pyrolysis due to localized overheating.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains the role of Biot number in torrefaction heat transfer control. It accurately describes the three regimes (Bi << 1, Bi >> 1, and Bi ≈ 1) and their physical implications. The statement about small particles (<2 mm) being free from heat and mass transfer limitations directly matches the original text [1]. The interpretation of Bi ≈ 1 indicating balanced internal and external resistances is consistent with original text [2]. The reactor design implications (fluidized beds for small particles, moving bed/rotary kilns for larger particles) follow logically from the Biot number analysis. All physical principles regarding heat transfer, conduction, and convection are correctly stated. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly defines Bi, accurately distinguishes internal vs external heat transfer control with Bi, and aligns with the source that small particles (<2 mm) are free from heat/mass transfer limitations and that Bi ≈ 1 reflects balanced resistances. The implications for reactor design and particle size are reasonable and consistent. No substantive factual or logical errors found.",
