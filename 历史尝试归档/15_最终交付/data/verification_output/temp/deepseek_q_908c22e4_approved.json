  "question_text": "How does the steam-to-methane ratio influence the reaction order with respect to steam in methane steam reforming kinetics on Ni-based catalysts, and what empirical evidence supports this relationship?",
  "standard_answer": "The reaction order with respect to steam in methane steam reforming on Ni-based catalysts exhibits a strong dependence on the H2O/CH4 ratio. Experimental studies have shown that the steam reaction order transitions from positive to negative as the steam-to-methane ratio increases. At low H2O/CH4 ratios (much less than 2), steam is necessary for the reaction and shows a positive reaction order. As the ratio approaches the stoichiometric value of approximately 2, the reaction order becomes zero as competing effects balance. When the H2O/CH4 ratio becomes significantly greater than 2, the reaction order becomes negative, typically in the range of -0.35 to -0.8. This behavior has been observed across different Ni-based catalyst formulations, with specific studies showing first-order dependency with respect to methane (m = 0.85-1.4) and slightly negative-order dependency with respect to steam (n = -0.35 to -0.8) under high steam-to-methane conditions. The empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that the reaction order of steam is dominated by the H2O/CH4 ratio, with the transition occurring around the stoichiometric ratio of 2.",

    "1": "In their work, about a first-order (m = 0.85–1.4) and a slightly negative-order (n = –0.35» –0.8) dependency with respect to methane and steam were found, respectively.",
    "2": "The reaction order of steam (n) is dominant by the H2O/CH4 ratio, i.e. n > 0 at the H2O/CH4 ratio much less than 2, n = 0 as the H2O/CH4 ratio is close to 2, and n < 0 when the H2O/CH4 ratio is much greater than 2."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text. It correctly states: (1) the reaction order for methane is approximately first-order (m = 0.85-1.4), (2) the reaction order for steam is slightly negative (n = -0.35 to -0.8) under high steam-to-methane conditions, (3) the steam reaction order depends on H2O/CH4 ratio with n > 0 when ratio << 2, n = 0 when ratio ≈ 2, and n < 0 when ratio >> 2. The answer provides additional context and explanation that is consistent with fundamental catalytic kinetics principles.
