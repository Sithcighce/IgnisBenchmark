  "question_text": "Quantitatively, how does the equilibrium carbon activity for methane cracking and the Boudouard reaction vary with temperature, and what implications does this have for selecting SOFC operating conditions with carbon-containing fuels?",
  "standard_answer": "The equilibrium carbon activity for methane cracking (CH4 → C + 2H2) and the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2) exhibits opposing temperature dependencies due to their thermodynamic properties. Methane cracking is endothermic (ΔH > 0), so its equilibrium constant increases with temperature according to the van't Hoff equation. Thus, carbon formation from CH4 is favored at higher temperatures (e.g., >700°C), where the reaction becomes spontaneous. Conversely, the Boudouard reaction is exothermic (ΔH < 0), leading to a higher equilibrium constant at lower temperatures (500–700°C). For example, at 600°C, the Boudouard reaction can produce significant carbon from CO, while at 800°C, methane cracking dominates. This has critical implications for SOFC operation: with high-CO fuels (e.g., syngas), lower operating temperatures (<700°C) risk carbon deposition via Boudouard, necessitating high steam or CO2 concentrations to gasify carbon. With high-CH4 fuels (e.g., natural gas), higher temperatures (>750°C) increase carbon risk from cracking, requiring optimized steam-to-carbon ratios (S/C > 2) to suppress carbon through reforming reactions. Operating outside these thermodynamic windows, or using equilibrium calculations, helps prevent carbon deposition and ensures stable performance.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "If the operating temperature is increased, a higher amount of carbon is expected to occur due to methane cracking, while amount of carbon formed due to Boudouard reaction is higher at lower operating temperatures.",
    "2": "Such equilibrium calculations are also used as simple prediction tools, which enable the user to adjust the operating conditions to prevent the undesired degradation effects."

Key points verified: (1) Methane cracking favored at higher temperatures (>700°C) - matches original text statement about 'higher amount of carbon...due to methane cracking' at increased temperature; (2) Boudouard reaction favored at lower temperatures (500-700°C) - matches original text statement about 'amount of carbon formed due to Boudouard reaction is higher at lower operating temperatures'; (3) Thermodynamic reasoning (endothermic vs exothermic, van't Hoff equation) is sound; (4) SOFC operating implications and use of equilibrium calculations align with original text's mention of 'equilibrium calculations...used as simple prediction tools...to adjust operating conditions to prevent undesired degradation effects'. The answer provides extensive detail with specific temperature ranges and S/C ratios, which goes beyond the original text but contains no factual errors or contradictions. All physical principles and cause-effect relationships are correctly stated.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly states that methane cracking is endothermic and becomes more favorable at higher temperatures, while the Boudouard reaction is exothermic and favors carbon formation at lower temperatures. These trends align with thermodynamic principles (van't Hoff) and match the ground-truth text. The operational implications for SOFCs—greater coking risk from CO at lower T and from CH4 at higher T, mitigated by added steam/CO2 and equilibrium calculations—are sound. Minor simplifications and lack of numerical carbon activity values do not contradict the core mechanisms.",
