  "question_text": "Based on the provided emission data for organic components in condensable particulate matter (CPM) from global coal-fired power plants, analyze how the particle size characteristics of CPM influence its health impacts and atmospheric behavior. Explain the physical mechanisms by which CPM formation occurs during coal combustion processes, specifically addressing how temperature changes in flue gas treatment systems affect CPM generation. Discuss how the non-uniform geographic distribution of coal-fired power plants might impact regional CPM concentrations and associated health risks.",
  "standard_answer": "The analysis begins with the particle size characteristics of CPM, which directly determine its health impacts and atmospheric behavior. According to the paper, 'Due to its particle size often falling within the range of 1–2 μm (belonging to PM2.5 level), CPM can penetrate the human respiratory system, leading to the development of asthma and cardiovascular disease.' This fine particle size enables deep lung penetration and systemic circulation, causing significant health risks. The physical mechanism of CPM formation involves temperature-dependent condensation processes during coal combustion. As the paper states, 'CPM is predominantly present in gaseous form in the flue. Its production is not significant until the flue gas temperature decreases to around 50°C, which occurs when the gas leaves the chimney (stack).' This temperature-driven condensation occurs because organic pollutants (VOCs and PAHs) and inorganic components in the flue gas undergo phase change and polymerization when temperatures drop below their condensation points. The formation is further enhanced by the complex chemical interactions between organic and inorganic components during temperature reduction in air pollution control devices. The non-uniform geographic distribution of coal-fired power plants significantly impacts regional CPM concentrations. Based on emission data showing 'the VOCs, PAHs and CPM contents emitted by global coal-fired power plants are estimated to be 88.1 Gg, 6.76 Gg (2.22 Gg in flue gas and 4.54 Gg in fly ash), and 600 Gg (organic components: 328 Gg, inorganic components: 272 Gg), respectively,' regions with high coal consumption like Asia experience elevated CPM concentrations. This geographic concentration leads to localized health risks, as areas with dense coal power plant clusters face higher exposure to fine particulate matter that can penetrate respiratory systems and cause chronic health conditions. The combination of fine particle size, temperature-dependent formation mechanisms, and uneven geographic distribution creates significant regional variations in air quality and public health impacts.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately addresses all three main aspects of the question: (1) particle size characteristics and health impacts - correctly cites the 1-2 μm size range and PM2.5 classification with respiratory penetration effects; (2) physical mechanisms of CPM formation - accurately describes temperature-dependent condensation at ~50°C when flue gas exits the stack, and correctly explains phase change and polymerization processes; (3) geographic distribution impacts - appropriately uses the global emission data (88.1 Gg VOCs, 6.76 Gg PAHs, 600 Gg CPM) to discuss regional concentration variations. All direct quotes match the original text exactly. The answer provides reasonable elaboration on mechanisms (e.g., 'complex chemical interactions,' 'systemic circulation') that are scientifically sound extensions of the core facts.

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer accurately reflects the key points from the provided text: CPM size (1–2 μm) and related health impacts, predominance in gas phase with significant formation upon cooling to ~50°C near the stack, and global emission magnitudes. It reasonably connects non-uniform plant distribution to regional CPM exposure. The only substantive concern is the added notion of polymerization during cooling, which is not in the source and is not a primary CPM formation pathway; however, this does not contradict the core facts. Overall, the reasoning is sound and consistent with the ground truth.",
