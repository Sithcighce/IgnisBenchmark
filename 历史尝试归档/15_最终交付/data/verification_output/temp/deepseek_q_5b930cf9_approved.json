  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper, analyze the impact of adding an extra catalytic layer like Ru–CeO₂ on Ni-based anodes for SOFCs using propane fuel. Specifically, what performance improvements in power density are documented, and what catalytic activity is attributed to Ru–CeO₂? Ensure your answer includes the mechanisms supported by the citations.",
  "standard_answer": "The addition of an extra catalytic layer such as Ru–CeO₂ on Ni-based anodes significantly enhances the power density of SOFCs when fueled with propane. According to the paper, the integration of the Ru–CeO₂ layer led to a substantial increase in power density, rising from less than 10 mW cm⁻² to 160 mW cm⁻² at 450°C and from 298 mW cm⁻² to 395 mW cm⁻² at 500°C. This improvement is attributed to the high catalytic activity of Ru–CeO₂ in the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons like propane, which facilitates the reforming process. The catalytic layer promotes the conversion of propane into more electrochemically active species, thereby boosting the overall electrochemical performance. The documented power density enhancements are directly linked to the catalytic properties of Ru–CeO₂, as it is among the first materials used as an anode reforming layer due to its effectiveness in partial oxidation reactions. These mechanisms are supported by the cited evidence, focusing on the measurable performance gains and the catalytic role without extrapolating unsupported claims about carbon deposition or fuel conversion rates.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text. It correctly states the power density improvements (from <10 to 160 mW cm⁻² at 450°C and from 298 to 395 mW cm⁻² at 500°C) and accurately attributes the catalytic activity of Ru–CeO₂ to its high activity in partial oxidation of hydrocarbons including propane. The answer appropriately explains the mechanism by which the catalytic layer enhances performance (facilitating reforming and conversion to electrochemically active species) and correctly notes that Ru–CeO₂ was among the first materials used as an anode reforming layer. The answer also appropriately acknowledges what is NOT supported by the citations (carbon deposition and fuel conversion rates). All factual statements align with the original text, the logical reasoning is sound, and the physical/chemical principles are correctly stated.",
