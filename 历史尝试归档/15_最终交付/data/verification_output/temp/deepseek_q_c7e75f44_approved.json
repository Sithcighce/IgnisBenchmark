  "question_text": "How does the spatial distribution of active material in catalyst particles (e.g., egg-shell configuration) affect heat and mass transport resistances in CO₂ methanation reactors, and what are the implications for material consumption and reactor performance?",
  "standard_answer": "The spatial distribution of active material in catalyst particles significantly influences heat and mass transport resistances in CO₂ methanation reactors. In egg-shell configurations where the active layer is concentrated near the particle surface, the diffusion path lengths for reactants and products are minimized, leading to reduced intraparticle mass transfer resistance. This configuration places the active catalytic sites closer to the external surface, allowing faster access for reactants (CO₂ and H₂) to reach active sites and facilitating more efficient removal of products (CH₄ and H₂O). The proximity to the surface also enhances heat dissipation from the exothermic methanation reaction to the bulk fluid, reducing thermal gradients within the catalyst particle. From a practical perspective, using egg-shell particles enables lower consumption of expensive catalytic material in the reactor while maintaining equivalent performance levels. This optimization balances reaction efficiency with material utilization, making it particularly valuable for industrial-scale CO₂ methanation processes where catalyst costs and transport limitations are critical considerations.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "particles with radial distribution of the active material in the porous matrix have been considered frequently. Amongst these, ‘egg-shell’ particles were regularly preferred, since they had active layers close to the catalyst surface, which reduce the heat and mass transport resistances",
    "2": "using such particles led to lower consumption of expensive material in the reactor without reducing the performance"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the egg-shell catalyst configuration and its effects on CO₂ methanation reactors. It correctly identifies that: (1) active material near the particle surface reduces diffusion path lengths and intraparticle mass transfer resistance, (2) proximity to the surface enhances heat dissipation from the exothermic reaction, reducing thermal gradients, and (3) this configuration enables lower consumption of expensive catalytic material while maintaining performance. All statements are consistent with the original text and represent sound physical principles in catalysis and transport phenomena. The answer provides appropriate elaboration on the mechanisms (reactant access, product removal, heat transfer) without introducing factual errors. The cause-effect relationships are correctly stated, and the practical implications align with the original text's assertions about material consumption and performance.",
