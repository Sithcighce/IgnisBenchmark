  "question_text": "How does methane addition to syngas mixtures affect ignition characteristics, and what specific chemical reactions are responsible for the observed ignition-inhibiting effects?",
  "standard_answer": "Methane addition to syngas mixtures exhibits complex ignition-inhibiting effects through specific chemical reaction pathways. Even with low methane concentrations (~6%), CH4 demonstrates an ignition-inhibiting effect due to OH radical consumption through the reaction CH4 + OH → CH3 + H2O. This consumption of OH radicals competes with chain-branching reactions that accelerate ignition, thereby increasing ignition delay times. The effect is particularly pronounced at high temperatures where OH radicals play a crucial role in the ignition process. For syngas mixtures containing >50% methane by mole fraction, CO with low concentrations (≤30%) shows no inhibiting effect, while methane itself remains the primary inhibitor. The presence of methane can also lead to two-step ignition behavior with separate regions of fast pressure increase, characterized by τign1 and τign2, indicating complex ignition chemistry. This behavior arises because methane's oxidation involves multiple intermediate species and competing pathways that can delay the transition to rapid heat release.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information from the original text and provides sound scientific explanations. Key points verified: (1) CH4 at ~6% mole fraction shows ignition-inhibiting effect via CH4 + OH → CH3 + H2O reaction consuming OH radicals - matches original text exactly. (2) For mixtures with >50% CH4, CO at ≤30% shows no inhibiting effect - consistent with original text. (3) The mechanistic explanations (OH radical consumption competing with chain-branching, temperature dependence, two-step ignition behavior) are scientifically sound and logically consistent with combustion chemistry principles. The answer provides additional context about ignition chemistry that is correct and enhances understanding without contradicting the source material. No factual errors or logical inconsistencies detected.",
