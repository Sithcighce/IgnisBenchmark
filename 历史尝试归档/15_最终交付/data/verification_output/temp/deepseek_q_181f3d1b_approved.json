  "question_text": "Explain the mechanisms by which temperature gradients in lithium-ion batteries during high-rate operations lead to non-uniform current distribution and accelerated local degradation.",
  "standard_answer": "Temperature gradients in LIBs during high-rate operations induce non-uniform current distribution through several interconnected mechanisms. First, the Arrhenius dependence of electrochemical reaction rates means that warmer regions exhibit lower charge transfer resistance and higher ionic conductivity, attracting more current. This localized current concentration generates additional Joule heating (I²R), further elevating temperature in a positive feedback loop. Second, the temperature-dependent solubility and diffusion coefficients of lithium ions cause preferential intercalation in hotter zones, leading to uneven state of charge (SOC) distribution. Third, this non-uniform current and temperature profile accelerates local degradation: in warmer areas, enhanced side reactions like solid electrolyte interface (SEI) growth and electrode decomposition occur, while in cooler regions, lithium plating may dominate during charging. The combined effect of thermal and current inhomogeneity results in spatially varied aging rates, potentially causing local failure due to overcharge or mechanical stresses from differential expansion.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the mechanisms by which temperature gradients lead to non-uniform current distribution and accelerated degradation in lithium-ion batteries. It accurately describes: (1) the positive feedback loop where temperature gradients cause non-uniform current distribution via Arrhenius-dependent reaction rates, which then generates additional Joule heating that further increases temperature gradients - this is fully consistent with the original text's statement that 'inhomogeneous current distribution in turn aggravates the temperature gradient'; (2) the consequence of local failure due to overcharge/over-discharge mentioned in the original text; (3) additional mechanistic details about lithium ion diffusion, SEI growth, and lithium plating that are scientifically accurate and represent reasonable elaboration beyond the original text. All physical principles (Arrhenius dependence, Joule heating, electrochemical kinetics) are correctly stated, and the cause-effect relationships are logically sound. The answer is more detailed than the original text but contains no factual errors or contradictions.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately explains that temperature gradients lead to non-uniform current due to temperature-accelerated kinetics and lowered resistances in warmer regions, and that this uneven current intensifies local heating, creating a positive feedback consistent with the original text. It also correctly links these gradients to localized degradation mechanisms (SEI growth, electrode decomposition in hot spots, lithium plating in cold spots), aligning with established thermophysical and electrochemical principles. No factual or logical contradictions with the ground-truth statements were found.",
