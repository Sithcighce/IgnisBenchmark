  "question_text": "How do catalysts in catalytic flow reversal reactors (CFRRs) enable methane oxidation at concentrations as low as 0.1%, and what general steps are involved in the catalytic combustion process according to the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "Catalysts in CFRRs enable ultra-lean methane oxidation by reducing the minimum methane concentration required for sustainable autothermic reactions. According to the paper, the minimum CH4 concentration for sustainable reaction in thermal flow reversal reactors (TFRRs) is around 0.2%, but this reduces to 0.1% in corresponding CFRR technology with catalyst use. The catalytic combustion process involves multiple sequential steps: diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface, adsorption of species onto the catalyst surface, chemical reaction on the catalyst, and desorption of product species from the catalyst surface followed by diffusion back into the bulk gas phase. This multi-step process allows catalytic systems to achieve methane oxidation at lower concentrations than thermal-only systems by altering the reaction pathways through surface-mediated reactions rather than relying solely on gas-phase combustion mechanisms.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Catalytic combustion provides an effective means to enhance ignition and flame propagation. For instance, the minimum CH4 concentration at which the reaction is sustainable or autothermic for the TFRR technology is around 0.2%, which reduces to 0.1% in a corresponding CFRR technology with the use of a catalyst.",
    "2": "Catalytic combustion is usually a multi-step process involving diffusion to the catalyst surface, adsorption onto the catalyst, reaction, and desorption of the product species from the catalyst surface and diffusion back into the bulk."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text. It correctly states that: (1) catalysts in CFRRs reduce the minimum sustainable CH4 concentration from 0.2% (TFRR) to 0.1% (CFRR); (2) the catalytic combustion process involves the multi-step sequence of diffusion to catalyst surface, adsorption, reaction, desorption, and diffusion back to bulk gas; (3) the mechanism enables lower concentration operation through surface-mediated reactions rather than gas-phase combustion. The answer provides appropriate elaboration on how catalysts alter reaction pathways, which is consistent with fundamental catalysis principles and does not contradict the original text. All factual statements are accurate and the logical flow is sound.",
