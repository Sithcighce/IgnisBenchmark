  "question_text": "Why does dry reforming with CO2 offer the highest thermochemical recuperation potential but is prone to fast coking compared to steam reforming?",
  "standard_answer": "Dry reforming (e.g., CH4 + CO2 → 2CO + 2H2) offers superior thermochemical recuperation because it utilizes CO2 from exhaust gas as a reactant, converting low-value CO2 into syngas (CO + H2) with a high enthalpy increase per mole of primary fuel. The endothermicity of dry reforming (ΔH > 0) allows efficient waste heat recovery, and the reaction produces two moles of H2 and two moles of CO per mole of CH4, significantly boosting the reformate's heating value. However, dry reforming is highly susceptible to coking due to the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2), which is thermodynamically favored at typical reforming temperatures (600–900 K) and low H2/CO ratios. The absence of steam in dry reforming eliminates the protective effect of steam gasification (C + H2O → CO + H2), which in steam reforming continuously removes carbon deposits. Additionally, CO2 is a weaker oxidizing agent than H2O, leading to slower kinetics for carbon removal. Catalysts in dry reforming often deactivate as carbon blocks active sites, whereas steam reforming's higher H2O partial pressure suppresses carbon formation through equilibrium shifts and enhanced oxidation pathways.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains why dry reforming offers superior thermochemical recuperation (utilizes CO2 from exhaust, high enthalpy increase, efficient waste heat recovery) and accurately identifies the coking mechanisms (Boudouard reaction, absence of steam gasification protection, weaker oxidizing agent). The chemical equations, thermodynamic principles, and temperature ranges are accurate. The comparison with steam reforming is sound - steam does provide protective effects against coking through gasification and equilibrium shifts. All statements are consistent with the original text's assertion that dry reforming offers best recuperation but is prone to fast coking, and that carbon deposition is a major concern in catalytic reforming. The answer provides detailed mechanistic explanations that are factually correct and logically consistent.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly captures that dry reforming offers high thermochemical recuperation and is prone to coking and explains the role of endothermicity, lack of steam gasification, and weaker oxidation by CO2. However, it includes a factual error about typical operating temperatures and incorrectly asserts that the Boudouard reaction is thermodynamically favored at those typical temperatures.
