  "question_text": "In the context of sustainable aviation fuels, how does the energy density of Fischer-Tropsch synthetic kerosene compare to conventional jet fuel, and what molecular characteristics account for these differences?",
  "standard_answer": "FT synthetic kerosene exhibits a gravimetric energy density slightly higher than conventional jet fuel due to its molecular composition. Conventional jet fuel contains aromatics (10-20%) and naphthenes, which have lower hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratios compared to paraffins. FT kerosene is predominantly linear and branched paraffins (high H/C ratio), resulting in greater heat of combustion per mass as C-H bonds release more energy than C-C bonds upon oxidation. However, the volumetric energy density of FT kerosene is slightly lower because branched paraffins have lower density than aromatic-rich conventional fuels. The absence of sulfur and nitrogen in FT fuels eliminates heteroatom oxidation penalties, further enhancing gravimetric efficiency. For aviation, where mass directly impacts fuel consumption, the higher gravimetric energy density of FT kerosene reduces the fuel mass required for a given flight range. The molecular characteristics—high paraffin content, controlled branching from zeolite isomerization, and lack of heteroatoms—make FT synthetic kerosene a superior sustainable alternative, though slight volumetric trade-offs require optimized fuel tank design.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly states that FT synthetic kerosene has slightly higher gravimetric energy density and slightly lower volumetric energy density compared to conventional jet fuel, which is consistent with the original text. The molecular explanations provided (high H/C ratio in paraffins vs. aromatics/naphthenes, C-H bond energy release, lower density of branched paraffins, absence of heteroatoms) are all scientifically sound and represent valid combustion chemistry principles. While the answer is significantly more detailed than the original text, all additional explanations are factually accurate and logically consistent. The answer does not contradict the original text but rather elaborates on the molecular mechanisms underlying the energy density differences mentioned in the original text. No factual errors or logical contradictions detected.",

          "The benefit from absence of sulfur and nitrogen on gravimetric energy density is minor in practice, though directionally correct."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground truth: FT kerosene has slightly higher gravimetric and slightly lower volumetric energy density than conventional jet fuel. The molecular rationale—higher paraffin content, higher H/C ratio, lower aromatics leading to lower density—is correct and consistent with thermochemical principles. Minor imprecision in the bond-energy explanation does not undermine the core correctness.",
