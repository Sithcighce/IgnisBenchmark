  "question_text": "Calculate the CO2 permeability in Barrer for a PIM membrane with a thickness of 50 μm, steady-state CO2 flux of 2.5 × 10⁻⁴ cm³(STP)/(cm²·s), and a pressure difference of 2 atm. Assume standard conditions and explain how thickness reduction impacts industrial applicability.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate CO2 permeability (P_CO2) in Barrer, use the formula: P_i = (N_i * L) / Δp, where N_i is the steady-state gas flux, L is membrane thickness, and Δp is pressure difference. Given: N_CO2 = 2.5 × 10⁻⁴ cm³(STP)/(cm²·s), L = 50 μm = 0.005 cm, Δp = 2 atm. Note that 1 Barrer = 10⁻¹⁰ cm³(STP)·cm/(cm²·s·cmHg), and 1 atm = 76 cmHg, so Δp = 2 * 76 = 152 cmHg. First, compute P_CO2 in base units: P_CO2 = (2.5 × 10⁻⁴ cm³(STP)/(cm²·s) * 0.005 cm) / 152 cmHg = (1.25 × 10⁻⁶ cm³(STP)·cm/(cm²·s)) / 152 cmHg ≈ 8.22 × 10⁻⁹ cm³(STP)·cm/(cm²·s·cmHg). Convert to Barrer: P_CO2 = (8.22 × 10⁻⁹) / (10⁻¹⁰) = 82.2 Barrer. Reducing thickness (L) directly increases permeability, as P ∝ 1/L for a given flux and pressure. Industrially, thinner membranes (e.g., 0.1–1 μm in TFC membranes) enhance permeance (P/L), reducing module size and capital costs. For example, halving thickness doubles permeance, improving efficiency in CO2 capture processes by lowering energy requirements and operational expenses, though it may challenge mechanical integrity and defect formation.",

    "1": "The permeability of gas i in a polymer, P_i, is defined as P_i = (N_i * L) / Δp, where Δp, N_i, and L are the pressure differences across the membrane, steady-state gas flux, and membrane thickness, respectively.",

However, the answer contains a fundamental conceptual error regarding the relationship between permeability and thickness.

The answer confuses permeability (an intrinsic material property) with permeance (P/L, which does increase as thickness decreases).
