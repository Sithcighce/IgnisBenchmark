  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, what combustion characteristics of pure ammonia contribute to its significantly lower laminar burning velocity compared to methane, and how do these characteristics affect flame propagation in practical combustion systems?",
  "standard_answer": "The paper identifies several key combustion characteristics of pure ammonia that contribute to its significantly lower laminar burning velocity compared to methane. According to the cited text, ammonia exhibits 'relatively high ignition energy (2–3 orders of magnitude higher than common hydrocarbons) and low laminar burning rate more than four times less than methane (< 0.010 m/s).' This high ignition energy requirement indicates that ammonia molecules require substantially more energy to initiate combustion reactions compared to hydrocarbon fuels like methane. The low laminar burning velocity directly impacts flame propagation in practical combustion systems by making flame stabilization more challenging, requiring specialized burner designs or flame holders to maintain stable combustion. Additionally, the paper notes that 'ammonia has a high heat of vaporization (1371 kJ/kg compared to ~271 kJ/kg of gasoline) and can be handled as a liquid in thermally insulated containers,' which affects fuel preparation and mixing processes in combustion systems. These combustion characteristics collectively result in slower flame propagation speeds, making ammonia combustion more difficult to sustain in conventional combustion devices without modifications to account for its unique properties.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately represents all key facts from the original text: (1) correctly states ammonia's ignition energy is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than hydrocarbons, (2) accurately reports laminar burning velocity is more than four times less than methane (<0.010 m/s), (3) correctly cites the high heat of vaporization (1371 kJ/kg vs ~271 kJ/kg for gasoline), and (4) appropriately explains the practical implications for flame stabilization and combustion system design. The logical connections between these properties and their effects on flame propagation are sound. While the answer provides additional context about practical implications (flame holders, burner designs), these elaborations are reasonable engineering inferences that don't contradict the source material. All numerical values and comparative statements match the original text exactly.",
