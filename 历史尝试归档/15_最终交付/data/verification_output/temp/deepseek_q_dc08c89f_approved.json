  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, how do temperature, excess air factor, and residence time influence combustion efficiency and carbon content in residues during fluidized-bed combustion of WPCBs? Provide a detailed explanation of the mechanisms and parameter effects, supported by specific experimental results.",
  "standard_answer": "In fluidized-bed combustion of WPCBs, temperature, excess air factor, and residence time critically influence combustion efficiency and residual carbon content through distinct mechanisms. Higher temperatures (800–1400°C) accelerate reaction kinetics by increasing molecular collision frequency and activation energy, promoting complete oxidation of organic components. The excess air factor (1.2–1.9) determines oxygen availability for combustion reactions; insufficient oxygen leads to incomplete combustion, while excessive air can cool the bed, reducing reaction rates. Residence time (0.25–0.75 s) affects the duration for fuel-oxidizer mixing and reaction completion. Experimental results demonstrate optimal conditions at 1200°C, excess air factor of 1.3, and residence time of 0.75 s, where CO concentration in flue gas decreases to approximately 40 mg Nm⁻³ and carbon content in residues falls below 1 wt%. This combination ensures sufficient thermal energy for decomposition, adequate oxygen supply for oxidation, and prolonged contact time for complete carbon conversion, minimizing unburned carbon and maximizing combustion efficiency.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and provides scientifically sound explanations. Key factual elements are correct: (1) temperature range (800-1400°C), excess air factor (1.2-1.9), and residence time (0.25-0.75 s) match the original text; (2) optimal conditions (1200°C, excess air factor 1.3, residence time 0.75 s) are correctly stated; (3) performance metrics (CO ~40 mg Nm⁻³, carbon content <1 wt%) are accurate. The mechanistic explanations are scientifically valid: higher temperatures do accelerate reaction kinetics through increased molecular collision frequency and activation energy; excess air factor does control oxygen availability with the described trade-offs; residence time does affect mixing and reaction completion. The cause-effect relationships are logically sound and consistent with combustion science principles. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all additional explanations (e.g., mechanisms of temperature effects, oxygen availability impacts) are correct and enhance understanding without introducing errors.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly describes how temperature, excess air, and residence time affect combustion efficiency and aligns with the reported experimental result (CO ≈ 40 mg Nm⁻³ and <1 wt% carbon at 1200°C, excess air factor 1.3, residence time 0.75 s). However, it contains a factual error by claiming temperature increases activation energy, which necessitates marking the answer as incorrect.",
