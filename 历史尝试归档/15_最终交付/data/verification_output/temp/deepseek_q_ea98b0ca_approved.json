  "question_text": "Using principles of combustion science and energy systems, explain the fundamental mechanisms by which metal chalcogenide catalysts resist anode poisoning in fuel cells, with specific focus on how chalcogens facilitate the oxidation and removal of poisoning intermediates. Your explanation should include the dual mechanisms mentioned in the paper and discuss how these mechanisms contribute to maintaining catalyst activity during fuel oxidation reactions.",
  "standard_answer": "Metal chalcogenides resist anode poisoning through two primary mechanisms supported by the paper. First, chalcogens facilitate the oxidation of poisoning species for the accompanying catalyst. This means that when poisoning intermediates like CO form during fuel oxidation reactions, the chalcogen component actively participates in oxidizing these species, converting them into less harmful compounds that can be removed from the catalyst surface. Second, chalcogens weaken the adsorption of poisoning species on the catalyst surface. By reducing the binding strength between poisoning intermediates and active metal sites, chalcogens prevent strong, irreversible adsorption that would otherwise block catalytic sites permanently. These dual mechanisms work synergistically - while weakened adsorption makes it easier for poisoning species to detach, the facilitated oxidation ensures their rapid conversion and removal from the system. This combination allows metal chalcogenide catalysts to maintain their activity during prolonged fuel cell operation, particularly important for complex fuels like methanol and ethanol that tend to produce strong poisoning intermediates during oxidation processes.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "MCs have attracted significant attention as anodic catalysts because of their antipoisoning characteristics; chalcogens facilitate the oxidation of poisoning species for the accompanying catalyst or weaken their adsorption on the catalyst surface.",
    "2": "SnS2 exhibits such an activity while supporting Cu- and Co-based catalysts. Furthermore, SnS2 possess a graphene like 2D nanosheet structure, yet, it possesses lower inertness, which provides higher possibilities of doping when it is used as support."
