  "question_text": "Calculate the minimum fluidization velocity for Geldart B particles with a Sauter mean diameter of 500 μm and density of 2500 kg/m³ in air at 20°C and 1 atm, using the Ergun equation. Explain the physical significance of the terms in the calculation.",
  "standard_answer": "The minimum fluidization velocity (U_mf) is calculated using the Ergun equation at the point where pressure drop equals the weight of the bed per unit area. The Ergun equation for pressure drop in packed beds is: ΔP/L = 150[(1-ε)^2/ε^3](μU/d_p²) + 1.75[(1-ε)/ε^3](ρ_g U²/d_p), where ε is voidage (typically 0.4-0.45 for Geldart B), μ is gas viscosity, ρ_g is gas density, d_p is particle diameter. At minimum fluidization, ΔP/L = (ρ_p - ρ_g)(1-ε)g. For air at 20°C and 1 atm: μ = 1.8e-5 Pa·s, ρ_g = 1.2 kg/m³. Assume ε_mf = 0.42. Substituting: (2500-1.2)(1-0.42)*9.81 = 14200 Pa/m. Setting equal to Ergun: 14200 = 150[(1-0.42)^2/0.42^3]*(1.8e-5*U/0.0005²) + 1.75[(1-0.42)/0.42^3]*(1.2*U²/0.0005). Simplifying: 14200 = 150*2.07*(1.8e-5*U/2.5e-7) + 1.75*7.82*(1.2*U²/0.0005) = 150*2.07*72*U + 1.75*7.82*2400*U² = 22356U + 32844U². Solving quadratic: 32844U² + 22356U - 14200 = 0 → U ≈ 0.22 m/s. The first term in Ergun represents viscous losses (laminar flow), dominant for small particles/low velocities; the second term represents inertial losses (turbulent flow). At U_mf, these balance the gravitational force, indicating transition from fixed to fluidized bed where drag supports particle weight.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer provides a detailed, methodologically sound approach to calculating minimum fluidization velocity using the Ergun equation. The physical principles are correctly stated: (1) the Ergun equation form with viscous and inertial terms is correct, (2) the condition at minimum fluidization (pressure drop equals bed weight) is correct, (3) the physical interpretation of viscous vs inertial terms is accurate. The original text confirms Geldart B classification exists and that empirical equations are used for fluidization transitions, which is consistent with the answer's approach. While the original text doesn't provide detailed validation of the specific calculation, it doesn't contradict it either. The answer demonstrates proper understanding of fluidization physics and the Ergun equation. The calculation methodology and physical explanations are sound based on established combustion/fluidization science principles.",
