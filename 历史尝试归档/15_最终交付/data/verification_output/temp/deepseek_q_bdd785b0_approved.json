  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain the fundamental differences between bubbling and circulating fluidized-bed regimes for ammonia combustion, focusing specifically on how gas velocities, bed material behavior, and heat buffering capabilities differ between these two regimes and their implications for ammonia combustion performance.",
  "standard_answer": "The transition between bubbling and circulating fluidized-bed regimes is governed by fundamental differences in gas velocities and bed material behavior. A bubbling fluidized-bed operates at lower gas velocities, creating a less violent fluidization environment where all bed material remains within the reactor. This regime provides superior heat buffering capacity due to the dense bed structure and higher residence times resulting from the lower fluidization velocities. In contrast, a circulating fluidized-bed operates at significantly higher gas velocities that exceed particle terminal velocities, causing substantial particle entrainment that requires external cyclone separation and recirculation systems. The intense mixing in circulating beds enhances mass transfer but reduces the effective heat buffering capacity compared to bubbling beds. For ammonia combustion specifically, the bubbling fluidized-bed's superior heat buffering, combined with its lower fluidization velocities and higher residence times, makes it particularly suitable for combustion of lower calorific fuels like ammonia, which benefits from the stable thermal environment and extended reaction times to overcome its challenging combustion characteristics including high autoignition temperature and low flame speed.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "A bubbling fluidised-bed features lower gas velocities and thus a less violent bed than in the circulating scenario so that all bed material remains in the reactor",
    "2": "In the bubbling regime, the bed more effectively buffers the heat than in the circulating fluidised-bed which, together with its lower fluidisation velocities and thus higher residence times, makes the bubbling fluidised-bed more suitable for combustion of lower calorific fuels"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately captures all key points from the original text and extends them appropriately. It correctly states: (1) bubbling beds operate at lower gas velocities with less violent fluidization where all bed material remains in reactor, (2) circulating beds operate at higher velocities exceeding terminal velocities causing particle entrainment requiring cyclone separation, (3) bubbling beds provide superior heat buffering due to dense bed structure, (4) bubbling beds have lower fluidization velocities and higher residence times, (5) these characteristics make bubbling beds more suitable for lower calorific fuels like ammonia. The answer also correctly explains the physical mechanisms (intense mixing in circulating beds, stable thermal environment in bubbling beds) and appropriately connects these to ammonia's challenging combustion characteristics (high autoignition temperature, low flame speed). All statements are consistent with fundamental fluidized bed principles and the original text. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions.",

It appropriately applies these differences to ammonia as a lower-calorific, hard-to-burn fuel, noting benefits of the bubbling regime. No factual or logical contradictions were found.",
