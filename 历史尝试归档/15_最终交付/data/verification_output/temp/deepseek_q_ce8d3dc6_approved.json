  "question_text": "How do computational analysis methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), enhance the understanding of charge transfer mechanisms and electronic properties in metal-organic framework (MOF) photocatalytic systems for combustion-related applications like CO₂ reduction and pollutant degradation?",
  "standard_answer": "Computational analysis methods, especially density functional theory (DFT), provide critical insights into the electronic properties and charge transfer mechanisms of MOF photocatalysts by modeling orbital energies, bandgap structures, and excited-state dynamics. DFT calculations reveal that photo-redox reactions in MOF networks primarily occur through ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), where delocalized π electrons in organic ligands (acting as valence bands) transfer to secondary building units (SBUs acting as conduction bands) via π→π* and/or n→π* transitions. The MLCT mechanism in MOF photocatalysis is found rather rarely due to the well-separation of metal centers from each other by ligand molecules in the MOF frameworks (i.e., fast recombination of charge carriers). Computational simulations demonstrate how functionalization strategies, such as amino-group substitution in ligands, narrow bandgaps by altering HOMO-LUMO energy levels, shifting absorption to visible light regions. Additionally, computational studies predict bandgap tuning through ligand modifications and guest encapsulation, which improve photoconductivity via structured donor-acceptor interfaces. These insights enable optimization of MOF design for enhanced photocatalytic efficiency in redox reactions relevant to combustion processes, such as CO₂ reduction and pollutant degradation, by aligning electronic properties with reaction thermodynamics.",

Key points verified: (1) Correctly describes LMCT mechanism with π→π* and n→π* transitions from organic ligands (VB) to SBUs (CB), matching original text [1]. (2) Accurately explains why MLCT is rare in MOFs due to metal center separation and fast charge recombination, consistent with original text [2].
