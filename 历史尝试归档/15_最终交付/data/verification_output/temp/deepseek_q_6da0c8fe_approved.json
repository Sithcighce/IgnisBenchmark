  "question_text": "How does combustion temperature influence the volatilization-condensation behavior of different trace element groups in coal fly ash, and what are the resulting enrichment patterns in particle size fractions?",
  "standard_answer": "Combustion temperature critically affects the volatilization-condensation behavior of trace elements in coal fly ash through thermally-driven phase transformations. The volatilization-condensation theory distinguishes three groups of elements with distinct behaviors: Group I elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti), classified as 'lithophiles', show little or no enrichment in smaller fly ash particles due to their lower volatility and refractory nature. Group II elements (As, Cd, Mu, Pb, Sb, and Se), defined as 'chalcophiles', display increasing concentration with decreasing particle size because they volatilize more readily at high combustion temperatures and subsequently condense on the surfaces of finer particles during flue gas cooling. Group III elements (Be, Cu, Ni, V, and Co) exhibit intermediate behavior, being enriched in smaller particles but to a lesser extent than elements in Group II. Higher combustion temperatures increase the extent of volatilization of mineral elements, thereby changing the characteristics of the ash produced. The finer fly ash fractions become enriched in glass, whereas minerals such as mullite, quartz, and lime characterize coarser fractions, creating a particle-size-dependent distribution of elements governed by temperature-dependent volatilization and condensation kinetics.",

It correctly describes: (1) the three-group classification of trace elements (Group I lithophiles with little enrichment, Group II chalcophiles with increasing concentration in smaller particles, Group III with intermediate behavior); (2) the specific elements in each group matching the original text; (3) the temperature-dependent volatilization mechanism; (4) the enrichment patterns showing finer fractions enriched in glass while coarser fractions contain mullite, quartz, and lime. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanisms (thermally-driven phase transformations, volatilization-condensation kinetics) which are consistent with combustion science principles and implied by the original text. No factual errors or logical contradictions are present.",
