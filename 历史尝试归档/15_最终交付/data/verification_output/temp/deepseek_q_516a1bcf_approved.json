  "question_text": "Explain the role of the Biot number in determining the thermal behavior of biomass particles during fixed-bed combustion, and how it influences the selection of modeling approaches for particle conversion.",
  "standard_answer": "The Biot number (Bi) characterizes the relative importance of internal versus external thermal resistance in solid fuel particles during combustion. When Bi < 0.1, internal temperature gradients are negligible, allowing the particle to be treated as thermally thin. This simplifies modeling by assuming uniform temperature throughout the particle, where heat transfer is dominated by external convection and radiation. The particle rapidly equilibrates with its surroundings, and conversion processes like drying, pyrolysis, and char oxidation occur simultaneously across the entire volume. Conversely, when Bi ≥ 0.1, significant internal temperature gradients exist, requiring the particle to be modeled as thermally thick. In this case, internal heat conduction must be accounted for, leading to sequential conversion fronts propagating from the surface inward. For biomass particles, which often have irregular shapes and varying sizes, the Biot number dictates whether detailed internal heat diffusion equations are necessary. High Bi values indicate that particle size, orientation, and thermal conductivity critically affect conversion rates, necessitating more complex numerical models that resolve intra-particle transport phenomena.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The Biot number provides a criterion for any modelling involving transport by convection and diffusion. When Bi < 0.1, the internal temperature and concentration gradients may be neglected, simplifying the problem by a thermally thin particle approach. On the other hand, when Bi ≥ 0.1, the particles are considered thermally thick and inner heat diffusion must be considered.",
    "2": "The propagation speed of such a front depends on the particle size, its orientation in the airflow, and the external conditions, which are related to the Biot number (Bi)."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the role of the Biot number in determining thermal behavior of biomass particles. It accurately states that Bi < 0.1 indicates thermally thin particles with negligible internal gradients, while Bi ≥ 0.1 indicates thermally thick particles requiring internal heat diffusion modeling. The answer correctly describes the implications for modeling approaches (uniform temperature vs. sequential conversion fronts) and properly identifies that propagation speed depends on particle size, orientation, and external conditions as related to the Biot number. All physical principles are sound, consistent with the original text, and logically coherent. The additional detail about simultaneous vs. sequential conversion processes and the need for complex numerical models at high Bi values represents valid elaboration that does not contradict the source material.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains that Bi < 0.1 supports a thermally thin treatment with negligible internal gradients, while Bi ≥ 0.1 requires modeling internal heat diffusion (thermally thick) and leads to conversion fronts. It aligns with the ground-truth thresholds and notes that front propagation depends on particle size, orientation, and external conditions related to Bi. The principles and causal relationships are sound; only a minor overstatement about simultaneous conversion is noted.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly defines the Biot number as the ratio of internal to external thermal resistance. It accurately uses the Bi < 0.1 criterion for the thermally thin assumption (uniform temperature, simplified model) and Bi ≥ 0.1 for the thermally thick assumption (internal gradients, complex model with heat diffusion). This aligns perfectly with the original text. The answer correctly elaborates on the physical consequences, such as simultaneous conversion in thin particles and propagating fronts in thick particles, which is consistent with fundamental combustion principles and implied by the original text.",
