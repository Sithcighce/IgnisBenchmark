  "question_text": "In thermal pyrolysis of polyolefins, how does temperature variation from 600°C to 900°C affect light olefin yields, considering the complex relationship described in the literature? What specific temperature range is identified as optimal for maximizing light olefin production, and how do radical mechanisms and secondary reactions contribute to the observed temperature dependence?",
  "standard_answer": "The temperature dependence of light olefin yields in polyolefin pyrolysis exhibits a complex, non-monotonic relationship rather than a simple increase from 600°C to 900°C. According to the literature, 'In thermal pyrolysis, the optimum temperature range to obtain a high yield of light olefins is between 750 and 900°C.' This indicates that temperatures below 750°C are suboptimal, while very high temperatures approaching 900°C may lead to over-cracking and reduced selectivity. The thermal decomposition mechanism involves radical formation through homolytic bond scissions, where 'The thermal decomposition of polyolefins during pyrolysis is initiated by homolytic bond scissions. During those homolytic scissions, initial radical intermediates are formed that react with the polymer chains and result in further decomposition through a radical mechanism.' At lower temperatures (600-700°C), radical formation is limited, resulting in incomplete conversion and lower light olefin yields. As temperature increases within the optimal range (750-900°C), radical chain mechanisms become more pronounced, enhancing chain scission and light olefin production. However, at prolonged residence times or very high temperatures, 'the produced light olefins can act as intermediates in bimolecular reactions and are then converted to aromatic compounds and coke,' explaining why careful temperature control within the 750-900°C range is crucial for maximizing yields while minimizing undesirable secondary reactions that reduce overall selectivity.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text. It correctly identifies the optimal temperature range (750-900°C), accurately describes the radical mechanism initiated by homolytic bond scissions, and properly explains secondary reactions converting light olefins to aromatics and coke at prolonged residence times. The answer provides a logical explanation for the non-monotonic temperature relationship: lower temperatures (600-700°C) have limited radical formation, the optimal range (750-900°C) enhances chain scission, and very high temperatures or prolonged residence times lead to undesirable secondary reactions. All physical and chemical principles are correctly stated, with proper cause-effect relationships. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or contradictions with the original text.",

          "Non-monotonic yield behavior is inferred and reasonable, but not directly stated in the ground text."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground text on the optimal temperature range (750–900°C), initiation via homolytic bond scission and radical mechanisms, and the role of prolonged residence time leading to bimolecular reactions producing aromatics and coke. It correctly frames the temperature dependence as complex and explains lower yields at 600–700°C via limited radical activity. The only minor extrapolation is linking very high temperature itself to reduced selectivity; the ground text explicitly links secondary reactions to residence time rather than temperature alone. Overall, the core mechanisms and trends are consistent with the provided literature.",
