  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how SO₂ inhibits the transformation of elemental mercury (Hg⁰) to oxidized mercury (Hg²⁺) in coal-fired flue gas, focusing on the specific mechanisms and complex compound formation mentioned in the citations.",
  "standard_answer": "SO₂ inhibits mercury transformation primarily through two key mechanisms supported by the paper. First, during flue gas recirculation in oxy-fuel combustion systems, high-concentration SO₂ directly inhibits the transformation of Hg⁰ to Hg²⁺ and Hgₚ. Second, SO₂ reacts with mercury species to form various complex compounds including HgSO, ClHgSO, BrHgSO, and ClHgSO₂. These complex compounds alter the mercury speciation pathways and reduce the availability of mercury for oxidation to Hg²⁺ species. The formation of these sulfur-containing mercury complexes represents an alternative reaction pathway that competes with the oxidation reactions, thereby reducing the overall efficiency of mercury oxidation. This inhibition effect is particularly significant in oxy-fuel combustion systems where SO₂ concentrations are elevated due to flue gas recirculation, leading to reduced mercury transformation efficiency compared to systems without significant SO₂ presence.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects both mechanisms described in the original text: (1) SO₂ inhibition of Hg⁰ transformation to Hg²⁺ and Hgₚ during flue gas recirculation in oxy-fuel combustion, and (2) formation of complex sulfur-containing mercury compounds (HgSO, ClHgSO, BrHgSO, ClHgSO₂). The answer correctly explains the mechanistic basis - that these complex compounds create alternative reaction pathways competing with oxidation reactions, thereby reducing mercury oxidation efficiency. The chemical principles are sound: formation of stable intermediate complexes can indeed inhibit oxidation by reducing availability of reactive species. The answer appropriately contextualizes the significance in oxy-fuel systems with elevated SO₂ concentrations. While more detailed than the original text, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with established combustion chemistry and mercury speciation principles.",
