  "question_text": "Explain how sulfur dioxide (SO₂) in flue gas promotes the conversion of alkali chlorides (NaCl, KCl) to hydrogen chloride (HCl) during municipal solid waste incineration, describing both homogeneous gas-phase and heterogeneous surface reaction pathways as documented in the provided paper.",
  "standard_answer": "The presence of SO₂ in flue gas facilitates HCl formation from alkali chlorides through both homogeneous gas-phase reactions and heterogeneous surface reactions. Homogeneously, SO₂ reacts with alkali chlorides and oxygen in the gas phase to form sulfates and release HCl, following the reaction: 2NaCl + 1/2O₂ + SO₂ + H₂O → 2HCl + Na₂SO₄. This sulfation process converts volatile alkali chlorides that would otherwise condense on boiler tubes into less problematic sulfates. Heterogeneously, SO₂ interacts with deposited alkali chlorides on heat exchanger surfaces, where conversion occurs at the solid-gas interface. The paper specifically notes that 'Some species that exist in the incineration chamber, such as SOx, facilitate the formation of HCl from inorganic chlorides (NaCl and KCl), either homogeneously in the gas phase or heterogeneously in the deposit.' This dual-pathway mechanism is crucial for mitigating corrosion in waste-to-energy plants by reducing the availability of chlorine for corrosive alkali chloride deposition. The reaction 2NaCl + 1/2O₂ + SO₂ + H₂O → 2HCl + Na₂SO₄ represents the key transformation where sulfur dioxide captures alkali metals to form stable sulfates while liberating hydrogen chloride.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes both homogeneous gas-phase and heterogeneous surface reaction pathways for SO₂-promoted conversion of alkali chlorides to HCl. It correctly quotes the original text stating that 'SOx facilitate the formation of HCl from inorganic chlorides (NaCl and KCl), either homogeneously in the gas phase or heterogeneously in the deposit.' The chemical equation 2NaCl + 1/2O₂ + SO₂ + H₂O → 2HCl + Na₂SO₄ is accurately reproduced. The answer provides appropriate context about sulfation processes, corrosion mitigation, and the dual-pathway mechanism, all of which are consistent with established combustion chemistry principles. The explanation of how SO₂ captures alkali metals to form stable sulfates while liberating HCl is chemically sound and aligns with the original text. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent.",
