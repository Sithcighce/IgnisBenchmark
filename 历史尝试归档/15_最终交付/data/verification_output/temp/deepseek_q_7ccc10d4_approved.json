  "question_text": "How do phase change materials (PCM) function in battery warm-up systems at subzero temperatures, and what specific improvements are achieved through the application of nanomaterials like nano-enhanced PCM?",
  "standard_answer": "Phase change materials (PCM) function in battery warm-up systems by storing thermal energy during phase transitions and releasing it to heat batteries from subzero temperatures. The paper specifically notes that 'Improvements on ameliorating the heat transfer rate and enhancing the heating efficiency in the external preheating systems, including the applications of nanomaterials such as nanofluids and nano-enhanced phase change materials (PCM)' are key advancements. This indicates that nano-enhanced PCMs improve thermal conductivity, which accelerates heat transfer rates during the warm-up process. Additionally, the paper states that 'PCM heating uses phase change materials for thermal energy storage and release during battery warm-up processes,' confirming the basic mechanism of latent heat storage. The integration of nanomaterials into PCMs addresses limitations in traditional external heating methods by reducing thermal resistance, leading to more uniform temperature distribution and faster warm-up times, which are critical for restoring battery performance in cold climates without excessive energy consumption.",
