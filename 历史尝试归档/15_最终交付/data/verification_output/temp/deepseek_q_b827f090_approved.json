  "question_text": "What are the fundamental differences between linear thermoelastic and rate-dependent non-linear material modeling approaches for SOFC components, and how do these differences affect long-term thermomechanical predictions?",
  "standard_answer": "Linear thermoelastic modeling assumes constant material stiffness throughout deformation, where stress-strain relationships follow Hooke's law and thermal strains are purely elastic and recoverable. This approach uses the constitutive relation σ = D(ε - αΔT), where only elastic strain contributes to mechanical response. In contrast, rate-dependent non-linear modeling accounts for time-dependent inelastic deformation through creep strain, where materials undergo permanent deformation even below yield stress under sustained loading. The key difference lies in the strain decomposition: linear models use ε_total = ε_mechanical + ε_thermal, while non-linear rate-dependent models use ε_total = ε_elastic + ε_plastic + ε_creep + ε_thermal. For SOFC components operating at high temperatures (600-1000°C), the rate-dependent approach captures creep phenomena that significantly affect long-term behavior. Creep strain develops in three regimes: primary (decreasing strain rate), secondary (constant strain rate), and tertiary (accelerating strain until failure). This time-dependent deformation leads to stress relaxation over long operation periods (up to 40,000 hours), which linear models cannot predict. The inclusion of creep is particularly important for metal components where stress relief occurs over time, affecting sealant integrity and overall stack hermeticity.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Unlike the rate independent plasticity, rate dependent creep does not need a higher stress value to develop more strain. It can develop at all non-zero stress values.",
    "2": "Under constant load, the strain vs. time behaviour of creep shows three typical regimes. The first one i.e., primary creep includes the stage in which the strain rate over time decreases, whereas the secondary stage shows a constant strain rate."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly distinguishes between linear thermoelastic and rate-dependent non-linear modeling approaches. Key points verified: (1) The answer correctly states that rate-dependent creep can develop at all non-zero stress values, consistent with original text [1] stating 'rate dependent creep does not need a higher stress value to develop more strain. It can develop at all non-zero stress values.' (2) The description of creep regimes (primary with decreasing strain rate, secondary with constant strain rate, tertiary with accelerating strain) matches original text [2]. (3) The constitutive relations and strain decomposition equations are physically sound. (4) The application to SOFC components at high temperatures and long operation times is appropriate. (5) The explanation of stress relaxation and its effects on component integrity is logically consistent. While the answer is detailed and comprehensive, all statements are factually accurate and consistent with the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly distinguishes linear thermoelastic (Hookean, purely elastic thermal strains) from rate-dependent non-linear modeling that includes time-dependent inelastic strains (creep). It aligns with the ground truth that creep occurs at all non-zero stresses and proceeds through primary and secondary regimes, and appropriately adds the commonly recognized tertiary stage without contradiction. It accurately notes stress relaxation and long-term effects relevant to SOFC operation, which linear thermoelastic models cannot capture. No factual or logical errors detected.",
