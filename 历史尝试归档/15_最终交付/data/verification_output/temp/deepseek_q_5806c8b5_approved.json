  "question_text": "Using principles of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and CFD modeling, explain how high catalyst-to-biomass ratios in catalytic fast pyrolysis lead to increased coke formation through diffusion limitations and polymerization reactions, and how this affects catalyst deactivation and bio-oil quality.",
  "standard_answer": "High catalyst-to-biomass ratios in catalytic fast pyrolysis significantly increase coke formation through enhanced diffusion limitations and polymerization reactions. From a fluid mechanics perspective, higher catalyst loading creates more porous pathways for pyrolysis vapors to diffuse into, but simultaneously increases the probability of vapor trapping within catalyst micropores. This trapping effect creates localized high concentrations of reactive intermediates, favoring polymerization reactions that form coke deposits. The high amount of catalysts induces the diffusion limitation by trapping more pyrolysis vapors inside pores, and that leads to polymerization to form coke on the surface of catalysts. From a heat transfer standpoint, the increased catalyst mass provides more surface area for heat distribution but also creates thermal gradients that promote secondary reactions. In terms of catalyst properties, zeolite catalysts with lower silicon-to-aluminum ratios (SAR) led to an increase in the aromatic formation and coke deposition, therefore both aromatic yield and catalyst deactivation are dependent upon the number of acid sites in zeolites. CFD modeling would show how vapor flow patterns change with increased catalyst loading, revealing stagnation zones where residence times are prolonged, further enhancing polymerization reactions. The resulting coke deposits block active sites, reduce effective surface area, and decrease catalyst activity, ultimately lowering bio-oil quality by diverting carbon from desirable aromatic hydrocarbons to solid carbonaceous residues.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly incorporates both key facts from the original text: (1) high catalyst amounts induce diffusion limitations by trapping pyrolysis vapors in pores, leading to polymerization and coke formation, and (2) zeolite catalysts with lower SAR increase aromatic formation and coke deposition due to higher acid site density. The answer expands appropriately on these core mechanisms by discussing fluid mechanics perspectives (vapor trapping in micropores, localized concentrations), heat transfer aspects (surface area and thermal gradients), and CFD modeling implications (stagnation zones, residence times). All additional explanations are consistent with established combustion science and catalysis principles. The cause-effect relationships are correctly stated (diffusion limitation → polymerization → coke formation → catalyst deactivation → reduced bio-oil quality). No factual errors or logical contradictions detected.",

          "Heat transfer claim that higher catalyst mass creates thermal gradients is somewhat speculative; in many CFP systems increased solids improve heat transfer and reduce macroscopic gradients, though micro-scale intra-particle gradients and coke-induced insulation can still occur.",
          "Phrase 'more porous pathways' is ambiguous; higher catalyst loading reduces reactor voidage but increases total catalyst pore volume. The intended meaning appears to be more available catalyst pore volume for vapor diffusion."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground-truth statements: high catalyst loading induces diffusion limitations by trapping vapors in pores, promoting polymerization and coke; and lower SAR (more acid sites) increases aromatics and coke, linking aromatic yield and deactivation to acidity. It correctly adds fluid mechanics/CFD aspects (longer residence/stagnation zones) and the consequences for catalyst deactivation and bio-oil quality. No factual contradictions or major logical errors are present; minor phrasing and a somewhat speculative heat-transfer point do not undermine overall correctness.",
