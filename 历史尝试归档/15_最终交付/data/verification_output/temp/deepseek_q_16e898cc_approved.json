  "question_text": "According to the paper 'Chemical looping combustion of solid fuels' by Adánez et al. (2018), what specific challenges must be addressed during scale-up of CLC systems to reduce unburnt compounds at the fuel reactor outlet, and how do the proposed solutions relate to achieving high CO₂ capture efficiency?",
  "standard_answer": "The paper identifies that for further scale-up of CLC systems, it is essential to reduce unburnt compounds at the fuel reactor outlet. Operational experience in iG-CLC has shown that complete fuel combustion is not possible, making an additional oxygen polishing step necessary. The presence of unburnt products increases oxygen demand and reduces combustion efficiency. However, CO₂ capture near 100% has been reported using a highly efficient carbon stripper, highly reactive fuels (such as lignites and biomass), or by the CLOU process. Proposals to reduce unburnt compounds include both improvement to the gas-oxygen carrier contact and new design concepts based on the current scheme for iG-CLC. Additionally, CLOU based on copper materials has shown that complete fuel combustion could be achieved. These approaches address the core challenge of incomplete combustion in scaled systems while maintaining high CO₂ capture efficiency through optimized reactor design and material selection.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key points from the original text. It correctly identifies: (1) the need to reduce unburnt compounds at fuel reactor outlet for scale-up, (2) that complete fuel combustion is not possible in iG-CLC requiring oxygen polishing, (3) that CO₂ capture near 100% has been achieved using highly efficient carbon strippers, highly reactive fuels (lignites/biomass), or CLOU process, (4) proposals include improving gas-oxygen carrier contact and new design concepts for iG-CLC, and (5) CLOU with copper materials can achieve complete fuel combustion. The answer also correctly explains the relationship between these solutions and CO₂ capture efficiency. While the standard answer is more detailed than the original text, all additional statements (e.g., about unburnt products increasing oxygen demand and reducing combustion efficiency) are logically sound and consistent with combustion science principles. No factual errors or contradictions detected.",
