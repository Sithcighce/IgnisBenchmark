  "question_text": "Using the independent parallel reaction (IPR) model for torrefaction kinetics, derive the rate equations for hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin decomposition, and explain how their different decomposition temperature ranges reflect their thermal stabilities based on their structural characteristics.",
  "standard_answer": "The IPR model treats hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin as decomposing independently with first-order kinetics. The rate equations are: dα_i/dt = k_i (1 - α_i), where α_i is the conversion fraction, k_i = A_i exp(-E_i/RT) is the Arrhenius rate constant, A_i is the pre-exponential factor, E_i is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. The overall biomass decomposition is the sum of these individual reactions. Hemicellulose, with branched structures and weak bonds, has the lowest thermal stability and decomposes at 220-315°C. Cellulose, with higher crystallinity and strong hydrogen bonding forming crystalline micro-fibrils, has higher thermal stability and decomposes at 260-400°C. Lignin, being a complex phenolic polymer with a highly branched, three-dimensional structure, has the broadest decomposition range due to its heterogeneous nature. The IPR model sums these rates to predict overall mass loss, with hemicellulose dominating early torrefaction stages due to its lower decomposition temperature range.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The decomposition temperature of hemicelluloses is between 220°C and 315°C. Hence, when biomass is torreﬁed, a drastic impact on hemicelluloses is always observed.",
    "2": "The decomposition temperature of cellulose is normally between 260 and 400°C, where the initiation period has been explained as the formation of 'active cellulose' through the depolymerization process."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly presents the IPR model with first-order kinetics rate equations (dα_i/dt = k_i(1-α_i)) and proper Arrhenius formulation. The decomposition temperature ranges for hemicellulose (220-315°C) and cellulose (260-400°C) exactly match the original text. The structural explanations are scientifically sound: hemicellulose's branched structure and weak bonds explain lower thermal stability, cellulose's crystallinity and hydrogen bonding explain higher stability, and lignin's complex phenolic polymer structure explains its broad decomposition range. The statement that hemicellulose dominates early torrefaction stages logically follows from its lower decomposition temperature. All physical and chemical principles are correctly stated with no contradictions to the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The rate expressions dα_i/dt = k_i(1 − α_i) with Arrhenius k_i are consistent with the IPR model treating hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin as independent first-order decompositions. The temperature ranges for hemicellulose (220–315°C) and cellulose (260–400°C) match the ground-truth PECS text. The structural explanations—hemicellulose being less thermally stable due to branched, weaker bonding; cellulose more stable due to crystallinity and strong hydrogen bonding; lignin having a broad decomposition range due to its complex, heterogeneous aromatic structure—are sound and logically consistent.
