  "question_text": "Using computational analysis principles from combustion science and energy systems, analyze how ligand functionalization in MOF photocatalysts affects their optical absorption properties and charge carrier dynamics for solar energy conversion. Specifically, explain the mechanisms behind bandgap reduction and quantify the resulting changes in absorption wavelength ranges based on the provided research, focusing on environmental/energy applications.",
  "standard_answer": "Computational analysis reveals that ligand functionalization in MOF photocatalysts significantly alters their electronic structure through charge transfer mechanisms. The bandgap of MIL-125(Ti) (3.6 eV) was reduced to 1.3 eV (λ = 950 nm, red/IR region) when diaminated ligands (e.g., 90% BDC-NH₂ and 10% BDC-(NH₂)₂) were incorporated. This substantial bandgap narrowing extends light absorption from UV to near-infrared, enabling broader solar spectrum utilization. The functional ligand motifs play a key role in determining excited-state lifetime by controlling charge carrier interactions. Computational simulations show that electron-donating amino groups modify HOMO-LUMO energy levels, facilitating ligand-to-metal charge transfer processes. This molecular-level engineering demonstrates how MOF structures can be computationally modeled to optimize performance in solar energy conversion systems, with absorption ranges shifting from approximately 345 nm (UV) to 950 nm (NIR), representing significant improvement in photon harvesting capability for environmental and energy applications.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information from the original text and applies sound scientific principles. Key facts are correct: (1) MIL-125(Ti) bandgap reduction from 3.6 eV to 1.3 eV with diaminated ligands (90% BDC-NH₂ and 10% BDC-(NH₂)₂), (2) absorption wavelength extension to 950 nm in red/IR region, (3) functional ligand motifs controlling excited-state lifetime through charge carrier interactions. The answer correctly explains the mechanism of bandgap narrowing through electron-donating amino groups modifying HOMO-LUMO levels and facilitating ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The wavelength conversion from 3.6 eV (~345 nm UV) to 1.3 eV (950 nm NIR) is mathematically correct (E=hc/λ). The additional context about computational modeling and solar spectrum utilization is scientifically sound and consistent with MOF photocatalysis principles. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with the original text.",
