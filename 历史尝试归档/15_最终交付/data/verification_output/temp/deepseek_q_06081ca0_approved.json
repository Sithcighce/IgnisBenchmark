  "question_text": "What are the mechanisms of alkali-induced slagging and fouling in boilers, and how do the melting temperatures of alkali compounds correlate with deposit formation?",
  "standard_answer": "Alkali-induced slagging and fouling occur through a multi-step mechanism initiated by the release of volatile alkali species (KCl, KOH, K2SO4) during combustion. These compounds condense on heat exchanger surfaces when flue gas temperatures drop below their dew points (e.g., KCl condenses at ~700°C). The process involves: (1) Condensation of alkali chlorides/sulfates forming a sticky initial layer due to their low melting temperatures (KCl mp: 770°C, K2SO4 mp: 1069°C). (2) Capture of fine ash particles by this sticky layer, which then undergo re-enrichment with alkali, maintaining adhesion. (3) Deposition of coarse particles trapped by the sticky surface, building a multi-layer slag structure. The low melting temperatures of alkali chlorides (e.g., NaCl mp: 801°C) are critical, as they remain molten or semi-molten on surfaces, promoting adhesion and growth. Fuels with high chlorine content favor KCl formation, which has lower melting points than sulfates, increasing slagging propensity. The presence of silica and alumina can form eutectics with alkali, further lowering ash fusion temperatures. This deposition insulates heat transfer surfaces, reducing efficiency and causing operational failures.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Alkali-induced slagging and fouling are attributed to the low melting temperature of alkali compounds formed in thermochemical conversion processes.",
    "2": "Due to the low melting temperatures, alkali chlorides and sulfates condense on the heating surface at lower flue gas temperatures, causing the formation of an initial sticky layer. Fine particles containing alkali metals, chlorine, and sulfur deposit on the initial layer, and capture coarse large particles."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes alkali-induced slagging and fouling mechanisms consistent with the original text. It correctly identifies: (1) the role of low melting temperature alkali compounds in forming sticky initial layers, (2) the condensation process when flue gas temperatures drop below dew points, (3) the sequential deposition mechanism where fine particles deposit on the sticky layer and capture coarse particles. The specific melting point values (KCl: 770°C, K2SO4: 1069°C, NaCl: 801°C) are factually correct. The answer provides additional detail about volatile alkali species, eutectic formation with silica/alumina, and operational impacts, which are accurate elaborations beyond the original text. The cause-effect relationships are logically sound, and all thermophysical principles are correctly stated. While more detailed than the original text, the answer contains no factual errors or contradictions.",

          "K2SO4 is not typically a volatile species; it generally forms via gas-phase reactions (sulfation of KCl/KOH) and condenses as fine particles rather than being released directly as a volatile."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer matches the ground truth: it attributes slagging/fouling to low-melting alkali compounds, describes condensation of alkali chlorides/sulfates forming a sticky initial layer, subsequent capture of fine and then coarse particles, and connects lower melting temperatures (and eutectic formation) with enhanced deposit formation. Numerical melting points cited are correct and the mechanisms align well. The only notable inaccuracy is labeling K2SO4 as a volatile species; otherwise the explanation is sound and consistent.",
