  "question_text": "Using the Arrhenius equation and equilibrium principles, explain why the water-gas shift reaction is typically operated in two stages (high-temperature followed by low-temperature) in industrial hydrogen production.",
  "standard_answer": "The water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O ↔ H2 + CO2) is exothermic (-41.1 kJ/mol), so lower temperatures favor higher equilibrium CO conversion per Le Chatelier's principle. However, kinetics governed by the Arrhenius equation (k = A exp(-E/RT)) show that reaction rates increase with temperature. Thus, a single-stage reactor faces a trade-off: high temperatures (350–500°C) with fast kinetics but lower equilibrium conversion, or low temperatures (150–250°C) with high conversion but slow rates. To resolve this, industrial systems use two stages: HT-WGS with Fe-Cr/Ni catalysts at 350–500°C for rapid initial conversion, followed by LT-WGS with Cu-Zn catalysts at 150–250°C to approach equilibrium. This sequential approach leverages kinetics in the first stage and thermodynamics in the second, maximizing H2 yield efficiently. The equilibrium constant KP decreases with temperature (e.g., KP ≈ 10^3 at <100°C vs. ~5 at 500°C), guiding stage design.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The Arrhenius principle reflects the importance of elevated reaction temperature for an enhanced reaction rate whereas Le Chatelier’s principle recommends lower reaction temperature for higher CO conversion.",
    "2": "Therefore, in practice, WGS is implemented in two stages where HT-WGS is followed by LT-WGS."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the two-stage WGS process using both thermodynamic and kinetic principles. It accurately states that the reaction is exothermic (favoring lower temperatures per Le Chatelier's principle for higher equilibrium conversion) while also correctly applying the Arrhenius equation to explain why higher temperatures are needed for faster reaction rates. The answer properly identifies the trade-off between kinetics and thermodynamics, and correctly describes the industrial solution: HT-WGS (350-500°C) for rapid initial conversion followed by LT-WGS (150-250°C) to approach equilibrium. The equilibrium constant trend (decreasing with temperature) is correctly stated. All statements are consistent with the original text and fundamental combustion/thermodynamic principles. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly applies Arrhenius kinetics and Le Chatelier’s principle to justify the high-temperature then low-temperature staging of the WGS reactor, fully consistent with the original text. It also provides reasonable temperature ranges and equilibrium trends. However, it introduces a factual inaccuracy by listing Ni as an HT-WGS catalyst; standard industrial HT-WGS catalysts are Fe–Cr, with LT-WGS typically Cu–Zn–Al.
