  "question_text": "Based on the provided research, how does the reversibility of sulfur poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) depend on operating temperature, and what specific temperature thresholds determine whether the degradation is reversible or irreversible?",
  "standard_answer": "The reversibility of sulfur poisoning in SOFCs is critically dependent on operating temperature, with distinct temperature thresholds determining whether the degradation process is reversible or irreversible. According to the research, sulfur poisoning exhibits reversible behavior at higher operating temperatures around 800°C, where performance deterioration can be recovered by removing sulfurous species from the fuel stream. This reversibility was demonstrated in studies using synthetic product gas from wood steam gasification containing 1-10 ppm H2S, where performance regeneration was achieved after sulfur removal. In contrast, operation at lower temperatures such as 700°C results in irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered. The temperature dependence of sulfur poisoning reversibility has been confirmed across different SOFC configurations, including both fuel electrode-supported and electrolyte-supported cells, indicating this is a fundamental thermal effect. The specific temperature threshold between reversible and irreversible behavior appears to lie between 700°C and 800°C, with the higher temperature facilitating regeneration while lower temperatures lead to permanent performance loss.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Sulfur poisoning as a reversible process under short exposure times was also reported in [47,48]. In the recently published study by Pongratz et al. [48], synthetic product gas from wood steam gasification including 1–10 ppm H2S was used as a fuel for SOFC, while the operating temperature varied between 750∘C and 800∘C.",
    "2": "Appari et al. [49], however, reported, that sulfur poisoning is reversible only at higher temperatures such as 800∘C, while the operation at lower temperatures such as 700∘C resulted in irreversible degradation."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text. It correctly states that sulfur poisoning is reversible at higher temperatures around 800°C and irreversible at lower temperatures such as 700°C, which directly matches the findings from Appari et al. [49]. The answer also correctly references the Pongratz et al. [48] study regarding synthetic product gas with 1-10 ppm H2S at 750-800°C showing reversible behavior. The identification of the temperature threshold between 700°C and 800°C is a reasonable inference from the original text. The mention of different SOFC configurations (fuel electrode-supported and electrolyte-supported cells) is not explicitly in the provided excerpt but does not contradict it and represents reasonable elaboration. All physical principles and cause-effect relationships are correctly stated.",
