  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how preferential diffusion effects are addressed in turbulent flame modeling using the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) approach, and describe the computational strategy employed to handle these effects efficiently.",
  "standard_answer": "The paper identifies that preferential diffusion phenomena can have a significant impact on flame structure and dynamics, particularly when hydrogen enrichment is involved. These effects arise from differences in molecular diffusion rates between species, which can alter local mixture compositions and flame behavior. In turbulent flames with strong preferential diffusion effects, the FGM approach addresses these challenges by incorporating an additional control variable specifically designed to capture changes in element mass fractions and enthalpy. This computational strategy allows the model to efficiently account for the variations caused by differential diffusion without requiring full resolution of all chemical species transport equations. The inclusion of this single additional control variable enables the FGM model to maintain accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost, making it suitable for practical combustion simulations where preferential diffusion plays an important role in flame dynamics and stability.",
