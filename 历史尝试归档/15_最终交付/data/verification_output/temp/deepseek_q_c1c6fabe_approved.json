  "question_text": "What are the primary failure mechanisms for thermoelectric generators in automotive exhaust applications, and how do thermal cycling, mechanical vibration, and high-temperature operation collectively degrade system performance over time?",
  "standard_answer": "Automotive thermoelectric generators face multiple synergistic failure mechanisms. Thermal cycling from engine start-stop cycles and load variations causes thermo-mechanical fatigue due to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches between semiconductor materials, metal electrodes, and ceramic substrates. This leads to crack formation at interfaces, increased contact resistance, and eventual delamination. Mechanical vibration from engine operation and road irregularities exacerbates these issues by introducing additional stress concentrations. High-temperature operation accelerates several degradation processes: oxidation and sublimation of thermoelectric materials above their stability limits, interdiffusion at semiconductor-metal interfaces creating high-resistance layers, and degradation of thermal interface materials reducing heat transfer efficiency. The combined effect of these mechanisms progressively increases both thermal and electrical contact resistances, reducing the effective temperature gradient across the thermoelectric elements and decreasing power output. Additionally, material property degradation from thermal aging reduces the Seebeck coefficient and increases electrical resistivity. The brittle nature of most thermoelectric materials makes them particularly vulnerable to fracture under these combined thermo-mechanical stresses. Successful automotive TEG designs must incorporate CTE-matched materials, robust interfacial engineering, vibration damping systems, and thermal management to mitigate these failure mechanisms and ensure long-term reliability over the required 10,000+ thermal cycles.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately addresses all primary failure mechanisms mentioned in the original text and provides scientifically sound elaboration. It correctly identifies: (1) thermal cycling challenges from >10,000 cycles with CTE mismatch issues, (2) mechanical vibration and shock effects, and (3) high-temperature degradation including oxidation, sublimation, and interface degradation. The answer provides appropriate technical depth explaining thermo-mechanical fatigue, crack formation, contact resistance increases, interdiffusion, and material property degradation - all consistent with established thermoelectric and materials science principles. The causal relationships (e.g., CTE mismatch → crack formation → increased resistance → reduced performance) are logically sound. While more detailed than the original text, all additional explanations (Seebeck coefficient reduction, thermal interface material degradation, brittle fracture vulnerability) are factually correct and relevant to automotive TEG failure mechanisms. The answer appropriately concludes with mitigation strategies consistent with the reliability requirements stated in the original text.",

          "Electrical contact resistance primarily reduces electrical performance (and causes local Joule heating) but does not directly reduce the temperature gradient across the thermoelectric legs; thermal contact resistance is the main contributor to lowering effective ΔT."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer is consistent with the ground-truth text: it correctly identifies thermal cycling (CTE mismatch, fatigue, cracking, delamination), mechanical vibration (added stress), and high-temperature operation (oxidation, sublimation, interface degradation) as key failure mechanisms. It logically explains how these mechanisms increase thermal/electrical interfacial resistances and reduce power output, and mentions long-term cycling (10,000+). The added details (interdiffusion, Seebeck/resistivity degradation, brittleness) are accurate and aligned with established thermoelectric reliability knowledge. Minor nuance regarding electrical contact resistance’s effect on ΔT does not undermine overall correctness.",
