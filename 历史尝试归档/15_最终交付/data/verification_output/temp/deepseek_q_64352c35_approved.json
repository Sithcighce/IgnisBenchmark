  "question_text": "How does the assumption of local thermal equilibrium simplify the energy equation in wood combustion models, and under what conditions is this assumption valid based on Peclet number analysis?",
  "standard_answer": "The local thermal equilibrium assumption simplifies the energy equation by considering a single temperature for all phases (solid, liquid, gas), reducing computational cost by avoiding separate energy equations. This is valid when heat transfer between phases is rapid compared to internal gradients, typically justified by high Peclet numbers (Pe = d * u * ρ * c_p / λ), where convective transport dominates over conductive transport. For wood combustion, large Peclet numbers indicate that gas flow through pores efficiently couples phase temperatures, supporting equilibrium. However, deviations occur if phases have significantly different thermal capacities or if flow rates are low, leading to errors such as overestimated conversion times. The assumption is more accurate for smaller particles or higher flow velocities, but in large logs with slow heating, separate phase temperatures may be needed for precision.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains that local thermal equilibrium simplifies the energy equation by using a single temperature for all phases, reducing computational cost - consistent with the original text stating it 'reduces the number of required temperature equations to one.' The answer accurately describes the Peclet number definition (Pe = d * u * ρ * c_p / λ) and correctly explains that large Peclet numbers justify this assumption when convective transport dominates over conductive transport, matching the original text. The additional discussion about conditions where the assumption breaks down (different thermal capacities, low flow rates, large particles) represents reasonable elaboration based on sound physical principles and does not contradict the original text. The cause-effect relationships are correct: high Pe → rapid inter-phase heat transfer → thermal equilibrium valid. While more detailed than the original text, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly states that LTE reduces the energy formulation to a single temperature equation, lowering computational cost, and that high Peclet numbers (Pe = d u ρ c_p / λ) justify the LTE assumption—both consistent with the provided ground truth. The additional context about conditions (small particles, higher velocities) is reasonable. One minor overreach is the claim about specifically overestimating conversion times, which is not universally true.",

          "The answer incorrectly states that deviations from local thermal equilibrium (LTE) lead to 'overestimated conversion times'. In a typical heating scenario, the solid phase temperature will lag the gas phase temperature. An LTE model assumes a single, averaged temperature that would be higher than the actual solid temperature. Since wood conversion (pyrolysis) rate is strongly dependent on the solid temperature, using a higher-than-actual temperature in the model would predict a faster conversion rate, leading to an *underestimated* conversion time, not an overestimated one."

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains how the LTE assumption simplifies the energy equation (one temperature equation) and correctly links its validity to high Peclet numbers, which is consistent with the provided original text. However, it contains a significant logical error regarding the consequences of the assumption's failure. By stating the conversion times would be 'overestimated', it reverses the expected physical outcome. This constitutes a factual error in the cause-effect relationship.",
