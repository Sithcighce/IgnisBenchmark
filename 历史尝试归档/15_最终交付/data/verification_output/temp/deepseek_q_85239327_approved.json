  "question_text": "Analyze the thermodynamic limitations of methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) at 700°C and 1 bar, explaining how hydrogen accumulation restricts conversion and how membrane reactors can overcome this limitation. Discuss the practical methane conversion limitations mentioned in the literature and explain the role of hydrogen-permeable membranes in shifting reaction equilibrium.",
  "standard_answer": "Methane dehydroaromatization (6CH₄ ⇌ C₆H₆ + 9H₂) is fundamentally limited by thermodynamics, particularly hydrogen accumulation within the reactor. According to the paper, 'Even at 700 °C and 1 bar, methane conversion is limited around 12% and the benzene yield is limited to approximately 8%.' This practical limitation arises because the reaction reaches equilibrium with only a fraction of methane converted due to hydrogen buildup, which thermodynamically favors the reverse reaction. The paper explicitly states that 'In both cases, the extent of methane conversion is thermodynamically limited by hydrogen accumulation within the reactor. In other words, the reaction can equilibrate with only a fraction of the methane being converted.' Hydrogen-permeable membranes provide a solution by selectively removing H₂ from the reaction zone, thereby reducing its partial pressure and shifting the equilibrium toward higher methane conversion. As the paper notes, 'Ideally, a hydrogen-permeable membrane that selectively removes H₂ can promote increased conversion and product yield.' This membrane-based approach represents a process intensification strategy that addresses the fundamental thermodynamic constraint while potentially improving benzene selectivity, though membrane materials and reactor integration present additional engineering challenges in practical implementation.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately represents all key information from the original text. It correctly states: (1) the specific conversion and yield limitations at 700°C and 1 bar (12% and 8% respectively), (2) the thermodynamic limitation due to hydrogen accumulation, (3) the equilibrium constraint preventing complete conversion, and (4) the role of hydrogen-permeable membranes in shifting equilibrium by selective H₂ removal. The answer includes direct quotes from the original text and provides sound thermodynamic reasoning consistent with Le Chatelier's principle. The additional context about process intensification and engineering challenges, while not in the original text, represents reasonable and accurate elaboration that does not contradict any established principles. All chemical equations, physical relationships, and cause-effect explanations are correct.",
