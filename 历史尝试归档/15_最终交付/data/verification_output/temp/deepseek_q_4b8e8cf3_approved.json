  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how SO₂ addition affects aromatic hydrocarbon and soot formation in hydrocarbon flames, focusing on the general oxidation mechanisms supported by the citations.",
  "standard_answer": "SO₂ addition reduces aromatic hydrocarbon and soot formation primarily through oxidation mechanisms. The paper states that 'the addition of SO₂ to hydrocarbon flames helps to reduce the concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons and soot through their oxidation by SO₂.' This indicates SO₂ acts as an oxidizing agent that converts aromatic precursors and soot particles to less harmful oxidation products. The oxidation process is temperature-dependent, as 'both experimental and theoretical studies show that BTEX oxidation by SO₂ takes place at temperatures above 540°C.' Since typical flame temperatures in industrial processes like Claus furnaces exceed this threshold, SO₂ can effectively oxidize benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEX) and other aromatic intermediates that serve as soot precursors. The oxidation disrupts the molecular growth pathways that lead to larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ultimately soot particles. While the specific reaction mechanisms aren't detailed in the provided citations, the general principle involves SO₂ participating in oxidative reactions that convert carbonaceous species to CO₂ and other oxidation products, thereby reducing the pool of available material for soot nucleation and growth.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and provides sound scientific reasoning. It correctly states that SO₂ reduces aromatic hydrocarbons and soot through oxidation mechanisms, directly citing the original text. The temperature threshold of 540°C for BTEX oxidation by SO₂ is accurately reported. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanism by explaining that SO₂ acts as an oxidizing agent, disrupts molecular growth pathways to PAHs and soot, and converts carbonaceous species to oxidation products. These elaborations are consistent with established combustion chemistry principles and do not contradict the original text. The answer also appropriately acknowledges that specific reaction mechanisms aren't detailed in the citations while providing reasonable general principles. All cause-effect relationships are correctly stated, and there are no factual errors or logical contradictions.",
