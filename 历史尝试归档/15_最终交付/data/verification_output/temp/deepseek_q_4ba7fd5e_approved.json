  "question_text": "Derive the scaling for the laser deflagration speed U_a in terms of laser irradiance I and wavelength λ_laser, starting from energy conservation in the rarefaction wave. Show the complete derivation including the relationship between critical density and laser frequency, and explain how the wavelength scaling differs from the original incorrect formulation. Ensure your derivation aligns with the proportional relationships provided in the paper citations without introducing unsupported numerical constants.",
  "standard_answer": "The laser deflagration speed U_a is derived by considering energy balance in the isothermal rarefaction wave behind the critical surface. The energy equation integrated over the flow, with laser energy absorption as a delta function at the critical surface (U_R = I δ(z - z_c)), yields I = 4 ρ_c c_Tc^3 for a completely ionized plasma (γ = 5/3). Using the isothermal sound speed c_Tc = √(P_c/ρ_c) and mass conservation ρ_a U_a = ρ_c U_c, with U_c = c_Tc at the critical surface, we substitute to get U_a = (ρ_c/ρ_a) c_Tc = (ρ_c/ρ_a) (I/(4ρ_c))^(1/3). The critical density ρ_c depends on laser frequency through ρ_c ∝ ω_laser^2, where ω_laser = 2πc/λ_laser. Substituting gives U_a ∝ ρ_c^(2/3) I^(1/3)/ρ_a ∝ ω_laser^(4/3) I^(1/3)/ρ_a. Since ω_laser ∝ 1/λ_laser, the correct scaling is U_a ∝ I^(1/3) λ_laser^(-4/3), not λ_laser^(4/3) as originally stated. This derivation highlights the inverse relationship between deflagration speed and wavelength due to the frequency dependence of critical density, consistent with the proportional relationships in the paper without unsupported numerical constants.",

    "1": "Then we find the laser deflagration speed from the mass conservation law, Eq. (10), as U_a = (ρ_c c_Tc)/ρ_a = (ρ_c/ρ_a)^(1/3) (I/(4ρ_c))^(1/3) ∝ ρ_c^(2/3) I^(1/3).",
    "2": "Evaluating for simplicity the plasma density at the ablation surface ρ_a by the initial density of the target, and invoking the dependence of the critical density on the laser frequency, Eq. (4), we find the laser deflagration speed determined by the laser light intensity and frequency as U_a ∝ I^(1/3) ω_laser^(4/3)."
