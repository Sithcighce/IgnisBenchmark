  "question_text": "In waste tire pyrolysis, how do secondary cracking reactions at high temperatures (600-900°C) affect the yield and composition of tire char, and what mechanisms drive the reduction in char yield with increasing temperature?",
  "standard_answer": "Secondary cracking reactions at high temperatures (600-900°C) in waste tire pyrolysis reduce tire char yield and alter its composition by promoting further decomposition of primary pyrolysis products. As temperature increases, volatile matter from initial rubber degradation undergoes cracking into lighter gases (e.g., methane, hydrogen) and aromatics, which escape the solid matrix, decreasing char mass. Mechanisms include radical-initiated scission of long-chain hydrocarbons and dehydrogenation reactions, which convert fixed carbon into gaseous products. For instance, at 700-900°C, char yield drops from 59.4 to 46.8 wt.% due to enhanced cracking rates, governed by Arrhenius kinetics where higher temperatures exponentially increase reaction rates. Additionally, secondary reactions can lead to carbon deposition from volatiles, but net char reduction dominates due to gasification and volatilization of carbonaceous material. This temperature-dependent behavior underscores the trade-off between char yield and quality, as higher temperatures may improve char porosity but at the cost of lower mass recovery.",

    "1": "The second stage involves secondary cracking of the produced pyrolysis products that mainly takes place in the temperature range of 660-850 °C, which has also been reported in the works of Han et al. [78] and Li et al. [76].",
    "2": "Increasing pyrolysis temperature from 700 to 900 °C, tire char yield was shown to decrease from 59.4 to 46.8 wt. % when one tonne of waste tire feedstock was pyrolysed in a rotary kiln reactor with a capacity of 4.3 m³ [168]."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes secondary cracking reactions in waste tire pyrolysis and is consistent with the original text. Key facts verified: (1) Secondary cracking occurs at high temperatures (600-900°C range aligns with the 660-850°C mentioned in original text), (2) The specific char yield reduction from 59.4 to 46.8 wt.% when temperature increases from 700 to 900°C matches exactly with the original text, (3) The mechanisms described (radical-initiated scission, dehydrogenation, Arrhenius kinetics) are scientifically sound and consistent with established pyrolysis chemistry, (4) The explanation of volatile escape, gasification, and the trade-off between char yield and quality are logically coherent. While the answer provides more mechanistic detail than the original text (e.g., specific mention of methane, hydrogen, aromatics, carbon deposition), these additions are scientifically accurate and do not contradict the source material. The answer appropriately addresses all aspects of the question regarding effects on yield/composition and mechanisms driving char reduction.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground truth: secondary cracking mainly occurs at high temperatures and increasing temperature from 700 to 900°C reduces char yield from 59.4 to 46.8 wt.%. The explanation that enhanced cracking of volatiles to gases and aromatics lowers char mass is sound and Arrhenius-based rate increase is correct. Minor mechanistic imprecision regarding dehydrogenation and gasification does not undermine the core correctness.",

        "reasoning": "The answer is factually and logically correct. It accurately explains that higher temperatures (600-900°C) promote secondary cracking of primary pyrolysis volatiles into lighter gases, which reduces the final char yield. The mechanisms described (radical-initiated scission, dehydrogenation) are correct for high-temperature pyrolysis. The answer correctly incorporates the numerical data from the original text (char yield decrease from 59.4 to 46.8 wt.%) and correctly attributes this trend to Arrhenius kinetics. The mention of the competing effect of carbon deposition versus the dominant effect of gasification/volatilization shows a nuanced and correct understanding of the process.",
