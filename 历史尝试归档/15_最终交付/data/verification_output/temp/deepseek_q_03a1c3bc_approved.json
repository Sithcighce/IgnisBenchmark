  "question_text": "How does the temperature glide in zeotropic mixtures during phase change enable better thermal matching with heat source and sink temperature profiles in ORC systems, and what role does mixture composition play in controlling this temperature glide?",
  "standard_answer": "Zeotropic mixtures exhibit non-isothermal phase change behavior characterized by a temperature glide, which provides significant advantages in ORC systems through improved thermal matching. The fundamental mechanism involves the varying volatility of mixture components during evaporation and condensation processes. As the mixture undergoes phase change, the more volatile components vaporize first at lower temperatures while less volatile components require higher temperatures, creating a gradual temperature increase during evaporation and a corresponding decrease during condensation. This temperature glide enables the working fluid temperature profile to better align with the temperature profiles of both the heat source (during evaporation) and heat sink (during condensation), reducing thermal mismatches that lead to exergy destruction. The degree of temperature glide is directly controlled by the mixture composition - specifically, the difference in boiling points between components and their relative concentrations. Changing the mixture percentage has a direct influence on the amount of temperature glide observed, allowing system designers to optimize the thermal matching for specific heat source and sink temperature profiles. This composition-dependent control provides immense flexibility in working fluid selection for ORC applications, making zeotropic mixtures particularly valuable for systems where the heat source and sink exhibit significant temperature variations.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the temperature glide phenomenon in zeotropic mixtures and its benefits for ORC systems. Key points verified: (1) Zeotropic mixtures exhibit non-isothermal phase change with temperature glide - consistent with original text [1]; (2) Temperature glide enables better thermal matching with heat source/sink - directly supported by original text [2]; (3) Mixture composition controls the temperature glide amount - confirmed by original text [2]. The answer provides additional mechanistic detail (volatile components vaporizing first, exergy destruction reduction) that is thermodynamically sound and consistent with established ORC principles. The explanation of how composition affects temperature glide through boiling point differences and relative concentrations is physically correct. No factual errors, logical contradictions, or inconsistencies with the original text were found.",
