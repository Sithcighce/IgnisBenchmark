  "question_text": "Calculate the volumetric storage capacity difference between Solar Salt operating at 290-565°C versus a thermal oil system at 290-400°C, given Solar Salt density = 1900 kg/m³, cp = 1.5 kJ/kg·K and thermal oil density = 900 kg/m³, cp = 2.5 kJ/kg·K.",
  "standard_answer": "For Solar Salt: ΔT = 565 - 290 = 275°C = 275 K. Volumetric storage capacity Q_v = ρ·cp·ΔT = 1900 kg/m³ × 1.5 kJ/kg·K × 275 K = 783,750 kJ/m³. For thermal oil: ΔT = 400 - 290 = 110°C = 110 K. Q_v = 900 kg/m³ × 2.5 kJ/kg·K × 110 K = 247,500 kJ/m³. The ratio is 783,750 / 247,500 = 3.17, meaning Solar Salt provides 3.17 times more storage capacity per unit volume. This substantial improvement arises from both the larger temperature difference (275K vs 110K) and favorable density, despite thermal oil's higher specific heat. The increased ΔT is possible because molten salts maintain thermal stability at higher temperatures than organic oils, which degrade above 400°C. This volumetric advantage directly reduces tank sizes and costs for equivalent energy storage.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly applies the volumetric storage capacity formula Q_v = ρ·cp·ΔT from the original text. All calculations are accurate: Solar Salt (1900 × 1.5 × 275 = 783,750 kJ/m³) and thermal oil (900 × 2.5 × 110 = 247,500 kJ/m³), yielding a ratio of 3.17. The explanation correctly identifies that higher ΔT increases storage capacity per volume, consistent with the original text's statement that 'successively higher ΔT increases the storage capacity per volume which allows for capital cost reduction.' The physical reasoning about molten salt thermal stability and the practical implications for tank sizing are sound and align with established thermophysical principles in thermal energy storage systems.",
