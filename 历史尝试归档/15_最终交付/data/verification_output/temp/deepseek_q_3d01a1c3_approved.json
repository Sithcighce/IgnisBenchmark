  "question_text": "Based on the literature review, how do combustion temperature and coal volatile content influence the concentration trends and ring distribution of PAHs during coal combustion, and what are the underlying mechanisms driving these relationships?",
  "standard_answer": "Combustion temperature and coal volatile content significantly influence PAH concentration trends and ring distribution through distinct mechanisms. The concentration of PAHs increases with temperature from 600 to 800°C due to enhanced pyrolysis-driven release of organic compounds, then decreases above 800°C as thermal cracking fragments larger aromatics into smaller molecules. At lower temperatures, PAHs detected primarily have a large number of rings (>4 rings), mainly attributed to free state PAHs released during coal pyrolysis. Higher volatile content promotes PAH generation by producing more organic free radicals at high temperatures, which facilitates PAH formation through complex chemical reactions. The temperature-dependent fragmentation shifts the ring distribution, with more three- and four-ring PAHs forming at higher temperatures due to molecular cleavage of large aromatics. These mechanisms explain why bituminous coal combustion releases the highest amount of PAHs, as it combines optimal volatile content with appropriate combustion conditions for PAH formation and preservation.",

    "1": "The concentration of PAHs increased with the increase in temperature from 600 to 800°C, while the opposite occurred in the temperature range from 800 to 1000°C.",
    "2": "At the low temperature stage, the PAHs detected had mainly a large number of rings (>4 rings), mainly attributed to the free state PAHs released during coal pyrolysis.",
    "3": "The higher the volatile content, the more organic free radicals are produced at high temperatures, which promotes the generation of PAHs."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key points from the original text: (1) PAH concentration increases from 600-800°C then decreases above 800°C, (2) low temperatures favor large-ring PAHs (>4 rings) from pyrolysis, (3) higher volatile content promotes PAH generation through organic free radicals. The answer correctly explains the underlying mechanisms including thermal cracking fragmentation at high temperatures and the shift to smaller ring PAHs (3-4 rings) due to molecular cleavage. The conclusion about bituminous coal is a reasonable inference based on the volatile content relationship.
