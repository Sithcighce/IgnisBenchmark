  "question_text": "What transport mechanisms govern water movement across polymer electrolyte membranes in vanadium redox flow batteries, and how do they impact battery performance and electrolyte balance?",
  "standard_answer": "Water transport across polymer electrolyte membranes occurs through three primary mechanisms: electro-osmotic drag, concentration-driven diffusion, and pressure-driven hydraulic permeation. During operation, protons moving through the membrane carry hydration shells via electro-osmotic drag, transporting water from anode to cathode. Simultaneously, water diffuses from regions of higher concentration to lower concentration due to osmotic gradients. Hydraulic permeation occurs when pressure differences between half-cells force water through membrane pores. These transport phenomena cause net water transfer between compartments, leading to electrolyte imbalance. Excessive water transport can cause cathode flooding (reducing active surface area) or anode concentration (increasing viscosity and precipitation risk). This imbalance degrades battery performance by increasing polarization losses, reducing capacity retention, and potentially causing mechanical stress on the membrane. Membrane design must therefore control water transport through pore size tuning, cross-linking, or surface modification to maintain proper electrolyte balance during long-term operation.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The polymer electrolyte membrane for VRFBs should also be able to suppress the preferential transport of water between two half-cells for proper electrolyte balance, to avoid dilution/flooding and precipitation/over concentration of electrolyte solutions.",
    "2": "During the operation of VRFBs, the transport of different species including water, vanadium ions, and protons are highly coupled."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly identifies and explains the three primary water transport mechanisms (electro-osmotic drag, concentration-driven diffusion, and pressure-driven hydraulic permeation) in VRFB polymer electrolyte membranes. It accurately describes the consequences of water transport imbalance (flooding, precipitation, performance degradation) which aligns with the original text's emphasis on avoiding 'dilution/flooding and precipitation/over concentration.' The answer also correctly notes the coupled nature of transport phenomena and provides sound mitigation strategies through membrane design. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with established electrochemical principles and the ground truth provided.",
