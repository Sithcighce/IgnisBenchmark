  "question_text": "In direct air capture systems using physical sorbents like zeolites and MOFs, how does ambient moisture affect CO₂ adsorption capacity, and what are the key mechanisms driving this behavior according to the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "Moisture significantly reduces CO₂ adsorption capacity in physical sorbents due to competitive interactions and structural impacts. For zeolites, the paper states that 'moisture in the air will lead to a significant decrease of adsorption capacity of zeolite' (Citation 1), indicating water molecules interfere with CO₂ binding sites. Similarly, for MOFs, 'two kinds of MOFs (HKUST-1 and Mg-MOF-74) are impaired by exposure to humidity' (Citation 2), suggesting water exposure degrades their performance. The mechanisms involve water molecules competing for adsorption sites, potentially blocking pore access or altering the sorbent's surface properties. In zeolites, water may interact with polar sites created by aluminum substitution, displacing CO₂. For MOFs, humidity can lead to structural changes or reduced affinity for CO₂. This competitive adsorption is particularly problematic in materials with high surface affinity for water, where moisture occupancy directly reduces available sites for CO₂ capture, impacting the efficiency of direct air capture systems.",

It correctly states that moisture reduces CO₂ adsorption capacity in zeolites (Citation 1) and that HKUST-1 and Mg-MOF-74 are impaired by humidity (Citation 2). The proposed mechanisms - competitive adsorption, site blocking, water interaction with polar sites in zeolites, and potential structural changes in MOFs - are all scientifically plausible and consistent with established adsorption science. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanisms while remaining faithful to the core facts from the original text.

It accurately reflects the information from the original text, stating that moisture negatively impacts CO₂ adsorption in both zeolites and MOFs. The provided mechanisms, such as competitive adsorption for active sites and potential structural degradation (especially for MOFs), are well-established principles in materials science and physical chemistry. The explanation that polar water molecules outcompete the less polar CO₂ for adsorption sites is a core concept in this field and is correctly applied here.",
