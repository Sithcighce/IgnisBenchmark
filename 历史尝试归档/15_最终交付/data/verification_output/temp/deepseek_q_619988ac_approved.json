  "question_text": "Using the distributed activation energy model (DAEM), derive the relationship between conversion degree (α) and temperature for WPCBs pyrolysis, and explain how this model accounts for the complex multi-step decomposition kinetics observed in thermogravimetric analysis. Focus specifically on the activation energy distribution and stages supported by the provided paper content.",
  "standard_answer": "The distributed activation energy model (DAEM) describes pyrolysis kinetics by assuming a continuous distribution of activation energies due to heterogeneous reactions in WPCBs. The fundamental equation is: dα/dt = ∫[A exp(-E/RT) f(E) dE], where α is conversion degree, A is frequency factor, E is activation energy, R is gas constant, T is temperature, and f(E) is the distribution function of E. For WPCBs pyrolysis, the decomposition involves multiple stages with varying activation energies. According to the paper, Stage I (α < 0.075) has an activation energy of 119 kJ mol⁻¹, while Stage II (0.075 < α < 0.85) shows activation energy gradually increasing from 119 to 357 kJ mol⁻¹. The average activation energy value was determined as 337.0 kJ mol⁻¹ by the DAEM method, which was comparable to that of FWO. DAEM fits this complex behavior by representing f(E) as a distribution function that captures the varying energy barriers across different conversion stages. This model avoids assuming a single reaction mechanism, instead integrating over all possible pathways, which aligns with the multi-step decomposition observed in TG analysis where activation energies change significantly with conversion degree.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains the DAEM model and its application to WPCBs pyrolysis. All factual statements are accurate: (1) The fundamental DAEM equation dα/dt = ∫[A exp(-E/RT) f(E) dE] is correct; (2) Stage I activation energy of 119 kJ mol⁻¹ matches the original text; (3) Stage II activation energy range (119 to 357 kJ mol⁻¹) is correctly stated; (4) Average activation energy of 337.0 kJ mol⁻¹ by DAEM method matches the original text; (5) The comparison with FWO is accurately mentioned; (6) The explanation of how DAEM accounts for complex multi-step decomposition through activation energy distribution f(E) is physically sound and logically consistent. The answer appropriately explains that DAEM integrates over all possible pathways rather than assuming a single mechanism, which correctly captures the model's strength in handling heterogeneous reactions.

It correctly explains that DAEM accounts for complex pyrolysis by assuming a distribution of activation energies, which corresponds to the multiple parallel reactions occurring in a heterogeneous material like WPCBs. The numerical values for activation energy at different conversion stages (Stage I and Stage II) and the average activation energy are cited correctly from the original text.
