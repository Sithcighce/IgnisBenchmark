Waste valorization 

As the world races toward its urban future, the quantity of wastes, one of the vital by-products of an en- 
hancement in the standards of living, is exponentially rising. The treatment of wastes employing plasma 
is an upcoming area of research and is globally used for the simultaneous processing of diverse wastes 
coupled with the recovery of energy and materials. Ground-breaking and cost-effective thermal plasma 
technologies with high eﬃciencies are a prerequisite for the growth of this technology. This paper deliv- 
ers an evaluation of the fundamentals such as the generation and characteristics of the thermal plasma 
along with the various types of wastes treatable by thermal plasma and the related issues. Furthermore, 
the authors discuss different types of advanced technologies as well as the material and energy recovery 
techniques and their present status worldwide, at lab-scale and industrial scale. The application of dif- 
ferent thermal plasma technologies is discussed as a means to promote this technology into alternative 
applications, which require higher ﬂexibility and greater eﬃciency. Mathematical modeling studies are 
also assessed with an objective to derive ideal conditions and permissible limits for the reactors and to 
test a variety of waste materials. A strategy to improve the feasibility and sustainability of waste utiliza- 
tion is via technological advancement and the minimization of environmental effects and process eco- 
nomics. This paper sheds light on diverse areas of waste utilization via thermal plasma as a potentially 
sustainable and environmentally friendly technology.

1. Introduction 

The 21st century has been marked by an exemplary progress 
in the ﬁelds of information, technology, research and development 
(R&D) coupled with a remarkable increase in the standards of liv- 
ing.  However,  the  ﬂip  side  is  the  rising  population  and  growing 
energy demand. As the world hurtles toward its urban future, the 
amount of wastes, one of the most important by-products of an 
urban lifestyle, is rising even faster than the rate of urbanization. 
It pressurizes the waste managers who are charged with a huge 
task:  get  the  waste  out  from  underfoot  and  do  so  in  the  most 
economically, socially, and environmentally optimal manner pos- 
sible. Waste management, especially solid waste management, is 
almost always the responsibility of local governments and is often 
their single largest budget item, particularly in developing coun- 
tries. Additionally, solid waste is one of the most malicious local 
pollutants - uncollected and improperly treated solid waste is usu- 
ally the leading contributor to local ﬂooding and pollution at all 
three levels, namely, air, water, and soil; and poses many potential 
kinds of risks which have a signiﬁcant impact on society and the 
environment at large. 

In 2016, the European Union (EU) generated around 272 mil- 
lion tons [1] whereas the US generated around 262 million tons 
[2] of municipal solid waste (MSW). The rapid growth in popula- 
tion with growing standard of living coupled with the rising in- 
dustrialization has enhanced the production of wastes in several 
streams, which is assumed to enhance further, in the near future. 
The thought provoking side of this story is the adverse inﬂuence 
which current routes deployed for waste management have. Land- 
ﬁll forms the leading route for waste disposal with its inherent but 
grave effects [ 3 , 4 ]. This pathway causes pollution and greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change, as well as 
signiﬁcant  losses  of  materials  -  a  particular  problem  for  the  EU 
which is highly dependent on imported raw materials. 

It is worth noting that the world produces around 2.1 billion 
tons of MSW per year and is anticipated to rise to 3.40 billion tons 
by 2050 [5] . At about 23%, the East Asia and Paciﬁc are produc- 

ing most of the global wastes. On the other hand, the Middle East 
and North Africa are generating the least (~ 6%) ( Fig. 1 ). As per 
the World Bank projections, by 2050, the fastest growing regions 
in waste production would be Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and 
the Middle East and North Africa, where the total waste generation 
is predicted to rise by more than three times, two times, and two 
times, respectively [5] . The grave side is that more than half of the 
wastes is currently openly dumped in these regions, consequently, 
the rising curves of wastes would have adverse implications for the 
environment and health, thus calling for urgent action. 

Thermal waste processing pathways such as pyrolysis, gasiﬁca- 
tion and incineration hold promises for more eﬃcient treatment 
and energy recovery from the wastes [ 6 , 7 ]. In recent years, inter- 
est in the application of advanced thermal plasma technology for 
wastes treatment has increased enormously, primarily because of 
its ability to supply elevated temperatures with high energy den- 
sities,  independence  from  the  type  of  waste,  potential  to  gener- 
ate saleable co-products coupled with a high destruction eﬃciency, 
control of the processing environment, environmental compatibil- 
ity and energy recovery [8-10] . By thermochemically treating the 
combustible parts (either in the absence of O 
2 in py- 
2 in sub-stoichiometric amount or 
rolysis, or in the presence of O 
in  the  presence  of  H 
2  or  syn- 
2  in  gasiﬁcation)  into  H 
2 O  or  CO 
gas  for  heat  and  power  generation,  and  vitrifying  the  noncom- 
bustible parts simultaneously into dense, inert, leach-resistant vit- 
riﬁed slags, pollutants emission can be reduced to almost zero and 
valorization of all the components of the wastes can be achieved.

The  history  of  the  application  of  plasma  processes  goes  back 
to nineteenth century when the metal working industries devel- 
oped and employed plasma to supply elevated temperatures in fur- 
naces [11-17] . In early twentieth century, chemical industries used 
plasma to generate acetylene employing natural gas as the feed- 
stock.  Plasma  deployment  for  MSW  processing  has  started  since 
early 1980s and its successful applications in processing diﬃcult 
wastes (hazardous wastes and others) clearly reﬂects the maturity 
of  this  technology  [18-23] .  As  far  as  specialized  plasma  reactors 
are concerned, Goldberger et al. [24] have reported plasma spout

They placed a RF plasma generator below the ﬂuidization distribu- 
tor of a ﬂuidized bed composed of sand, zirconia and graphite. In 
early 1970s, Bal and co-authors [26] employed spout bed to carry 
out coal pyrolysis in DC Ar-H 
2 plasma. Albeit fundamental devel- 
opments of waste treatment using plasma started taking place in 
1980s and 90s, actual enactment and operation at commercial level 
initiated around two decades ago [9] . 

Plasma is usually considered as the fourth state of matter and 
is composed of electrons, ions, neutrals in the ground state, excited 
species and photons. It is worth noting that overall the plasma is 
electrically neutral. It is interesting to know that more than 99% of 
the known universe is in the plasma state, e.g. in the sun [ 27 , 28 ]. 
Plasma is the state of matter with the highest energy per particle. 
The high energy content of the plasma makes it very useful for a 
wide variety of applications. When the heavy particle temperature 
approaches the electron temperature, local thermodynamic equi- 
librium is obtained and such plasmas are known as thermal plas- 
mas [27] . Types of plasmas and types of thermal plasma generators 
are depicted in Fig. 2 . 

Fundamentally,  the  heat  transfer  which  occurs  between  the 
plasma and a particle when the latter is in contact with the for- 
mer is depicted in Fig. 3 . The heat transfer in thermal plasma pro- 
cess is similar to that of conventional thermal proces. As thermal 
plasma is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), it may be de- 
scribed as a ﬂuid with speciﬁc thermodynamic and transport prop- 
erties. Therefore, heat transfer in ThP can be described in terms of 
heat convection, conduction and radiation. Comparing to other ﬂu- 
ids, thermal plasma is characterized by very high enthalpy, ther- 
mal  conductivity  and  radiation  intensity,  and  thus,  heat  transfer 
in thermal plasma is extremely high. The net energy required for 
the heating and subsequent melting of the particle is denoted by 
Q and it is the difference between the conductive and convective 
heat transferred from the plasma to the particle and the radiative 
energy loss from the surface of the particle to the environment. 

The particle is also heated by the radiation coming from plasma 
denotes  as  q r A ,  where  q r  is  radiative  power  from  the  plasma  to 
unit surface area of the particle [29] . The heat transfer equation is 
given as Eq. (1) . 

Q = hA ( T p − T s ) + A q r − σ (cid:3)AT 4 
s 

(1) 

Where h is heat transfer coeﬃcient (heat transferred per unit 
area  per  Kelvin),  A  is  the  surface  area  of  the  particle,  T p  is  the 
plasma temperature, T s is the surface temperature of the particle, 
q r is the radiation heat ﬂux (heat transferred per unit area per unit 
time) from plasma to unit surface area of particle, σ is the Stefan- 
Boltzmann constant and (cid:3) is the particle emissivity (ratio of the 
energy radiated from the particle’s surface to that radiated from 
a black body). In simple terms, Eq. (1) depicts the heat transfer 
mechanisms taking place in early stages as the surface of the par- 
ticle vaporizes after absorbing the heat and form gaseous products 
leading to heat transfer and as a result the mechanisms change. 

Investigators have used the thermal plasma pathway to treat a 
variety of wastes and produce fuel gas which in turn was employed 
for diverse applications. Interestingly, the inert glassy slag which is 
obtained as a by-product in the plasma assisted waste treatment 
can  be  upgraded  to  value  added  products  such  as  glass  ceram- 
ics, road ﬁller material, building construction material, etc. [ 19 , 30 ]. 
On the other hand, some researchers have employed plasma tech- 
nology  to  synthesize  carbon  nano-spheres  (CNs)  from  methane 
[ 31 , 32 ], acetylene [33] , propane [34] , polymers [35-37] , waste tires 
[38] and waste rubber [15] along with the generation of gaseous 
products. Furthermore, plasma technology is also applied for the 
treatment of metal containing wastes for metal recovery and reﬁn- 
ing. Valuable metals such as Ag, Au, Cu, Al, Fe, Zn, etc. can be re- 
claimed for a wide variety of wastes such as waste circuit boards, 
red mud, galvanic sludge, etc. [39-44] . 

The aim of this article is to evaluate different thermal plasma 
based  waste  treatment  pathways  as  depicted  in  the  cartoon 
( Fig. 4 ). In the next section, we explain thermal plasma generation 
technologies along with their properties. In Section 3 , we discuss 
various types of waste and issues related to some special kinds. 
Section 4 explains diverse thermal plasma assisted routes to pro-

ence of LTE in a plasma does not mean that plasma is in com- 
plete  thermodynamic  equilibrium  [27] .  One  of  the  cardinal  rea- 
sons for the deviation from complete thermodynamic equilibrium 
is the lack of excitation equilibrium. However, this deviation does 
not have any impact on a large number of engineering applications 
[28] . 

The ratio of electric ﬁeld to pressure ( E/p ) plays a key role in 
reﬂecting the kinetic equilibrium in a plasma. The heavy particles’ 
temperature approaches the electron temperature for small values 
of E/p (either small E or greater p or both). This is considered to be 
the fundamental requirement for LTE in a plasma. Other require- 
ments  are  excitation  and  chemical  equilibrium  along  with  some 
limitations on the gradients in the plasma [45-47] . In general, pres- 
sures in LTE plasmas are higher than 10 kPa as pressures below 10 
kPa cause the electron temperature to surpass the heavy particles’ 
temperature. In Eq. (2) , Ohm’s law establishes the relation between 
current density and electric ﬁeld.

Where j is current density and σ e is electrical conductivity.

current state of the art and classify inspiring novel technologies. 
This paper also sheds light on the various mathematical modelling 
studies and their associated limitations. It is followed, in Section 6 , 
by a discussion of plasma assisted waste treatment at industrial 
scale and its current scenario worldwide. The environmental im- 
pact and economics of thermal plasma (hereafter called ThP) based 
processing plants are also discussed in the Section 7 . Conclusions 
are  drawn  and  perspectives  for  future  applications  are  given  in 
Section 8 . In spite of the large volume of R&D conducted in the 
aforementioned areas, there is no all-inclusive review on ThP based 
waste utilization with an emphasis on related areas. This article 
will assist R&D effort s into the scale-up of ThP based waste treat- 
ment plants.

2.1. Generation of thermal plasma vis-à-vis treatment of waste 

Basically, plasmas are generated by passing an electric current 
through  a  gas.  In  general,  gases  are  insulators  at  ordinary  room 
temperatures and therefore, in order to make it an electrical con- 
ductor,  ample  amount  of  charge  carriers  need  to  be  generated. 
Plasmas are generated via many routes such as by high intensity 
arcs, by microwaves, by shock waves, by a radio frequency induc- 
tion (RF) and by laser or high energy particle beams. In addition, 
plasmas can be generated by heating gases in an elevated temper- 
ature furnace. However, this pathway is only employed with metal 
vapors with low ionization potentials on account of inherent tem- 
perature limitations [ 27 , 28 ]. 

For waste treatment, most ThPs are produced either by an elec- 
tric arc or by RF. Some plasmas are also produced by microwave or 
DC-RF combination. However, arc plasmas are leading and widely 
employed on account of their insensitivity to the alterations in pro- 
cess conditions. Table 1 represents different plasma systems with 
respect to the waste treatment. 

2.1.1. Arc plasma 

Electric  arc  generated  plasma  is  classiﬁed  in  two  categories 
namely, transferred arc and non-transferred arc. In transferred arc 
conﬁguration, the waste material (to be treated) is made as one of 
the electrodes and is directly exposed to the arc plasma. The tem- 
perature of the arc is normally in the range of 120 0 0–20 0 0 0 K and 

is a function of 4 factors – (1) arc power, (2) plasma gas, (3) loca- 
tion in the arc and (4) cooling of the arc [9] . One of the attractive 
features of transferred arc conﬁguration is the requirement of min- 
imum plasma gas ﬂow rates. The reactors employing transferred 
arc  are  available  for  a  broad  range  of  power  from  few  hundred 
watts to tens of megawatts. Another unique feature of this conﬁg- 
uration is the ability to have multiple rod electrodes (MRC). MRC 
enables the arcing between two rod electrodes which in turn aid 
in indirect heating of the material. Moreover, it permits the cre- 
ation of multiple series arcs between the waste and the electrode. 
In addition, it allows the operation in AC or three-phase mode. 

In the non-transferred arc conﬁguration, the plasma jet leaving 
the torch (which holds the arc), is employed to treat the wastes. 
The temperature of the plasma jet leaving the water-cooled plasma 
torch is from 10 0 0 0 to 20 0 0 0 K and is dependent upon the plasma 
gas and, power level and design of the torch [52] . In real scenarios, 
the plasma starts to decay after exiting the torch and therefore, the 
waste is not usually exposed to these elevated temperatures. 

Transferred  arc  conﬁgurations  are  more  desirable  as  far  as 
waste treatment is concerned. It is on account of the availability of 
high heat ﬂuxes and high total heat ﬂows as major fraction of the 
heat ﬂux is linked with the current ﬂow. Eq. (5) depicts the heat 
ﬂux ( q A ) given to the anode where the ﬁrst two terms constitute 
around 50% of the total heat transfer [ 53 , 54 ].

trical  conductivity,  k  is  Boltzmann’s  constant,  e  is  the  electronic 
charge, T e and T a are the electron and heavy particle temperatures, 
respectively, K e  and K a  are the electron and heavy particle ther- 
mal conductivities, respectively, x 
i  is the ionization energy of the 
plasma gas and Q 
rad is the radiation transfer. The principal limita- 
tion of transferred arc systems follows from the fact that treated 
waste must be electrically conducting material. 

For non-transferred arc conﬁguration, convective heat transfer 

relation is employed as mentioned in Eq. (6) . 
q P = h T  ( T O − T S ) + Q 

rad 

(6) 

where h T is the heat transfer coeﬃcient. It is a function of plasma 
thermal conductivity, Reynolds number and Prandtl number and, 
therefore,  it  is  dependent  upon  ﬂuid  dynamic  situation  [ 55 , 56 ]. 
T 0 is the plasma temperature and T S is the waste temperature. It 
should be noted that the characteristics of the gas change sharply 
in  the  thermal  boundary  layer,  the  use  of  properties  at  an  av- 
erage ﬁlm temperature between the free stream and the surface 
temperatures  may  direct  to  ﬂawed  outcomes  and  consequently, 
an average over an integral quantity should be taken to account 
for  plasma  reactions  increasing  the  heat  transfer.  For  instance, 
Eq. (7) reﬂects the same principle for thermal conductivity ( K ).

Plasma torches employing AC or 3-phase have been commonly 
used  since  about  40  years  before  especially  for  transferred  arc 
reactors.  One  of  the  many  3-phase  designs  worth  mentioning  is 
given  by  Rutberg  which  is  a  three-  electrodes  non-transferred 
conﬁguration [ 50 , 57 ]. The electrodes contain water-cooled copper 
tubes. The erosion of the electrodes was minimized by the move- 
ment of the arc attachment employing the self-magnetic ﬁeld of 
the current in the electrodes. However, DC is the ﬁrst choice in 
the majority of the newer installations. It is on account of reasons 
such as improved control over the arc position, lower noise level, 
more stable operation, lower electrode consumption, comparatively 
lower  refractory  wear  and  lower  power  consumption  [ 20 , 58 ].  A 
simple comparative schematic of DC non-transferred plasma torch 
and DC transferred plasma torch is depicted in Fig. 5 . 

As  far  as  plasma  gas  is  concerned,  the  most  commonly  em- 
ployed gas is air on account of two reasons - (1) to supply oxygen 
to carbonaceous waste for reactions and (2) to reduce the process 
cost. Oxygen is also used as a plasma gas. It decreases the total gas 
ﬂow in the plasma reactor and also reduces the nitrogen content of 
the produced gas, which is desirable in some applications. Usage of 
oxygen as plasma gas is limited by higher electrodes erosion rate 

in oxygen atmosphere. In some cases, nitrogen and carbon diox- 
ide are also employed as the elevated arc voltages enhance the jet 
power. It is worth noting that a similar or higher impact can be ob- 
tained by steam plasmas, although at a cost of enhanced electrode 
erosion due to the mixture of H 
2  and OH radicals. The Insti- 
tute of Plasma Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences and the 
Tokyo Institute of Technology employ plasma torches with steam 
for waste treatment [ 59 , 60 ]. Argon is also used as a plasma gas 
with an advantage of enhanced electrode life. The ﬂip side of ar- 
gon is its low speciﬁc heat which culminates in low torch power 
levels and enthalpy ﬂuxes of the gases exiting the torch, along with 
low energy transfer rates.

2.1.2. Radio frequency induced (RF) plasma 

RF plasma is generated by high frequency current usually in the 
range of 2 to 27 MHz ﬂowing in a coil surrounding the plasma 
chamber  [47] .  The  electric  ﬁeld  is  induced  inside  the  chamber 
and  initiates  a  current  along  a  ring  shaped  route  inside  the  re- 
actor producing the plasma. In the absence of electrodes, neither 
plasma is contaminated by metallic vapors nor electrode erosion 
takes place. However, immense care is required in optimization of 
the injection location of the waste into the torch and of the gas 
ﬂow  rates.  Moreover,  RF  torches  lack  ﬂexibility  as  far  as  plasma 
gas ﬂow rates and torch power are concerned [9] . Furthermore, the 
heating eﬃciencies of the torches are generally lower. Typically, RF 
plasma torches are employed for hazardous waste destruction. A 
RF plasma torch is shown in Fig. 6 . 

2.1.3. DC-RF combinations 

Hybrid plasma systems are developed to compensate the lim- 
itations of individual systems, for instance, RF plasma has many 
attractive features such as high purity, large plasma volume and 
low gas velocity. The ﬂipside of RF system is diﬃcult ignition and 
an easy extinction under some operating conditions. On the other 
hand, easy ignition and stable operation are cardinal advantages 
of DC plasma system. Consequently, DC-RF combination was de- 
veloped to overcome the limitations of RF system. Kawajiri et al. 
[61] designed and developed a DC-RF system, where RF-ICP (where 
ICP is Inductively coupled Plasma) ﬂow (6 kW) was employed as 
the main plasma and DC plasma jet (1 kW) was used as the auxil- 
iary. DC plasma jet was mounted on the RF-ICP torch and was used

to ignite RF-ICP ﬂow and stabilize it during the course of operation. 
Ar was the working gas whereas alumina micro-particles were em- 
ployed as the tracers to examine the in-ﬂight particle properties. 
They reported strong interaction between DC ﬂow and RF-ICP ﬂow 
which culminated in complex ﬂow structure for the hybrid system. 
This, in turn, has also resulted in instability and ﬁnally, the hybrid 
ﬂow was extinguished. It highlights the need of further studies re- 
lated  to  interactions  between  the  different  ﬂows  and  also  about 
the characteristics of hybrid ﬂow. 

2.1.4. Microwave (MW) plasma 

MW plasma is generated by electromagnetic radiations in the 
frequency range from 300 MHz to 10 GHz. In general, MW plasmas 
(usually 2.45 GHz) are denser as compared to RF plasmas (13.56 
MHz) [ 28 , 62 ]. In addition, MW plasma zone is larger, too. MW in- 
duced plasma can further be sub-classiﬁed into several categories 
such as surface wave discharges, cavity induced plasma, electron 
cyclotron resonators, free expanding atmospheric plasma, etc. All 
these MW induced plasmas work under a wide range of operating 
conditions where power ranges from few W to several hundred kW 
and pressure ranges from around 0.1 Pa to over hundred kPa, ap- 
plied for both noble and molecular gases [62] . A MW plasma torch 
is shown in Fig. 7 . 

2.2. Characteristics of thermal plasma 

The  key  characteristics  of  ThP  are  determined  by  its  compo- 
sition  followed  by  the  thermodynamic  properties  and  transport 
properties. The latter two are functions of the former. The database 
of these properties plays a vital role in the modeling of ThP pro- 
cessing and plasma reactors. 

2.2.1. Plasma composition 

If a thermal plasma is produced from a monoatomic gas such 
as argon (Ar) as shown in Eq. (8) , then the following three species 
compose  the  plasma,  namely  electrons,  neutral  Ar  atoms  with 
some in excited state and positive Ar ions with some in excited 
state. 

Ar ↔ A r 

+ + e 

(8) 

The  Eggert-Saha  equation,  Dalton’s  law  and  the  condition  for 
quasi-neutrality of the plasma determine the plasma composition 
for the aforementioned case, as depicted in Eqs. (9) –(11) [ 27 , 28 ].

(12) emphatically reﬂect that the species in excited states follow 
a Boltzmann distribution. It is worth noting that the Eggert-Saha 
equation is treated as a ‘mass action law’ for the ionization process 
as it can be derived from the principles of thermodynamics. 

2.2.2. Thermodynamic characteristics 

The thermodynamic characteristics of plasma consist of many 
properties such as the mass density, the internal energy, the en- 
thalpy,  the  speciﬁc  heat  and  the  entropy.  Moreover,  free  energy 
(Helmholtz  function)  and  free  enthalpy  (Gibbs  function)  are  de- 
rived thermodynamic properties. The mass density (as mentioned 
in  Eq.  (14) )  can  easily  be  derived  from  the  plasma  composition 
where n 
i re- 
ﬂects the analogous mass [ 27 , 28 ].

The other thermodynamic properties such as the internal en- 
ergy, the enthalpy, the speciﬁc heat, the entropy, the free energy 
and the free enthalpy are derived from the partition functions and 
play a vital role in the assessment of the thermodynamic functions. 

2.2.3. Transport characteristics 

In real world scenarios, ThPs are not uniform in nature. They 
exhibit gradients in characteristics such as particle number den- 
sities ( n ), velocity components ( v x ), temperatures ( T ) and electric 
ﬁeld  intensity  ( E ).  Fluxes  are  generated  by  these  gradients  and 
have linear relationships with these gradients provided the latter 
is within certain limits. These linear relationships may be deduced 
from Fick’s law, Ohm’s law and Fourier’s law [ 27 , 63 ]. 

Energy and momentum are transferred among particles by col- 
lisions and consequently, ample details about the collision interac- 
tions are required to calculate the transport coeﬃcients as these 
coeﬃcients are a function of collision cross sections among par- 
ticles [28] . Theoretical calculation of collision processes is a chal- 
lenging task on account of complex structures of molecules and 
atoms.  Highly  simpliﬁed  models  for  deﬁning  collision  cross  sec- 
tions were generated in some cases but experimental data are very 
limited [27] . Therefore, for intricate mixtures, the transport coeﬃ- 
cients are usually unknown or uncertain. This problem has further 
grown in ThPs in real scenarios, as they deviate from LTE. 

3. Different types of wastes vis-à-vis thermal plasma treatment 
and issues related with them 

Thermal  plasmas  are  employed  to  treat  a  wide  spectrum  of 
wastes for example, hazardous waste (HW), municipal solid waste 
(MSW), medical waste (MW), etc., as it delivers high heat ﬂuxes 
at elevated temperatures and high ﬂuxes of reactive species, which 

8

• Wastes  with  large  fraction  of  halogens:  These  types  of 
wastes  also  include  a  wide  spectrum  of  plastic  materi- 
als which necessitates elevated temperature treatment and 
quenching. It is often diﬃcult to get a saleable co-product. 
• Inorganic solid materials: They are commonly treated for the 
recovery of valuable components. The volume reduction for 
these kind of wastes is achieved via melting. They can also 
be  oxidized  and  restrained  in  the  form  of  a  non-leaching 
slag. 

In general, wastes are also categorized based on their form of 
appearance and on the fraction of hazardous material in them. A 
commonly employed list of various waste materials is: 

(1) Municipal  solid  waste  or  MSW  is  the  major  waste  stream 
in any country with typically a low level of contaminants. 
MSW  is  more  commonly  known  as  trash  or  garbage  and 
consists of everyday items that are used and then discarded, 
such as product packaging, grass clippings, furniture, cloth- 
ing, bottles, food scraps, newspapers, appliances, paint, etc. 
The  most  common  pathway  for  its  treatment  is  landﬁll- 
ing.  Increasing  pressure  on  landﬁll  sites  has  imposed  the 
use  of  other  volume  reduction  methods  such  as  incinera- 
tion which is commonly employed to extract the heat from 
the waste. Thermal plasma technology is widely employed 
to treat MSW around the globe. Detailed discussions can be 
found in Section 4 . 

(2) Medical solid waste (MW) contains a wide spectrum of con- 
taminated  material.  However,  the  high  heat  content  is  fa- 
vorable  for  incineration.  But  as  compared  to  incineration, 
plasma  assisted  treatment  decreases  the  exhaust  gases  to 
as  low  as  10%.  The  plasma  treatment  plants  not  only  of- 
fer the possibility of small local treatment plants but also 
a volume reduction of the wastes by 90% vis-à-vis inciner- 
ation plants [75] . The thermal plasma based process offers 
many attractive features including the generation of syngas 
for electricity production. Any treatment of MW should be 
cost-effective and should also be supported by the regula- 
tions. However, a hybrid process which includes plasma pro- 
cess  coupled  with  incineration  or  any  other  thermal  pro- 
cess offers better utilization of the caloriﬁc content of the 
wastes. 

(3) Hazardous liquids and gases including commonly employed 
solvents, PCB containing oils and CFCs. Most of these ﬂuids 
have high caloriﬁc content except CFC, still they cannot be 
treated via incineration on account of halogen content which 
may lead to other toxic formations during incineration. 
(4) Residues from incinerators which usually consists of bottom 
ash and ﬂy ash and contain large chunks of heavy metals. 
Incineration  of  wastes  such  as  MSW  is  widely  adopted  in 
many nations, especially in those where landﬁlling is strictly 
regulated  such  as  Japan.  About  70%  of  total  MSW  gener- 
ated in Japan is incinerated with a total production of about

enable the destruction of any kind of waste. In addition, the heat 
source is directional in nature with sharp interfaces which can be 
controlled independently of the chemistry. ThP can produce a tem- 
perature of up to around 20 0 0 0 K which is almost ten times more 
than what is generated via fossil fuel combustion [20] . Both the 
commonly employed classiﬁcations of various types of wastes are 
shown in Fig. 8 . 

High throughput coupled with compact reactor geometry, very 
high quench rates in the order of greater than 10 6 K/s which en- 
able the formation of speciﬁc gas and solid material and, low gas 
ﬂow rates as compared to fossil fuel combustion, form the other 
attractive features of waste treatment by ThP [ 20 , 64 ]. On the other 
hand, the ﬂipside of this kind of waste treatment is the employ- 
ment of the most useful and expensive form of energy – electricity 
[65] . However, a complete comparative cost evaluation frequently 
exhibits  the  economic  viability  of  ThP  assisted  waste  treatment. 
Table 2 reﬂects diverse types of waste treated via different plasma 
systems. 

3.1. Types of wastes vis-à-vis plasma treatment 

Heberlein  and  Murphy  [9]  have  given  the  classiﬁcation  of 
wastes on the basis of composition as mentioned below with an 
objective to choose an optimal treatment pathway: 

• Wastes  with  high  organic  material  content:  These  kind  of 
wastes have high caloriﬁc content. The retrieval of this heat 
via syngas employing a ThP process is a lucrative option.

15–30%  as  ﬂy  ash  or  bottom  ash  [ 9 , 48 ].  Where  ﬂy  ash  is 
collected  in  the  ﬁlters,  bottom  ash  is  collected  below  the 
grate.  The  major  fraction  of  toxic  materials  such  as  heavy 
metals is found in ﬂy ash as they easily evaporate during 
the  processing  of  the  wastes  [76] .  Many  nations  including 
Europe  have  stringent  ﬂy  ash  treatment  regulations.  Ther- 
mal plasma treatment of these incinerator residues is widely 
adopted  on  account  of  several advantages such  as  volume 
reduction by 50% and conversion of toxic heavy metals to 
a non-leaching slag. When high temperature ﬂuxing agents 
are mixed with these toxic materials at around 1800 to 20 0 0 
K, they generate a glassy slag which is non-leaching in na- 
ture  and  fulﬁlls  the  leaching  norms  for  the  slag  [ 9 , 77 ].  A 
considerable  amount  of  work  was  carried  out  to  demon- 
strate  the  stability  of  such  slags  along  with  the  leaching 
rates of heavy metals from such slags. Typical composition 
of MSW incinerated ashes is shown in Table 3 . 

(5) Sewage sludge and other sludge with high organic and mois- 
ture  content,  and  contaminated  soil  with  harmful  organic 
materials. The contaminants and moisture are removed from 
these  kind  of  wastes  by  treating  them  at  comparatively 
lower temperatures. A volume reduction by a factor of 20 
is usually achieved [9] . Other considerations are similar to 
those applied in incinerator residue wastes. 

(6) Low level radioactive waste (LRW) and, military waste and 
other wastes which may range from nerve gas ordinance to 
asbestos materials. All these wastes have high negative val- 
ues. In majority of cases, commonly employed waste treat- 
ment techniques (incineration and landﬁlling) are not feasi- 
ble. In general, the ThP pathway can be used for all these 
wastes  and  offers  a  volume  reduction  by  a  factor  of  3.  In 
addition,  it  also  enables  the  separation  of  radioactive  ma- 
terial from the non-hazardous portion with the encapsula- 
tion of the hazardous part in a glassy non-leaching slag. It 
is worth noting that the low boiling point radioactive ma- 
terial should be captured from the exhaust gases in a ﬁlter 
and reprocessed. 

(7) Asbestos  containing  waste  is  hazardous  in  nature  and  can 
cause  fatal  pulmonary  diseases  even  with  traces  of  it  in 
the lungs [78] . Conventional methods include its solidiﬁca- 
tion using cement or polymeric resins [ 79 , 80 ]. However, ThP 
treatment provides complete destruction. A commercial fa- 
cility named INERTAM treats asbestos wastes and converts 
them into a non-leachable product, with an elevated tem- 
perature plasma vitriﬁcation route employing air as plasma 
gas [78] . 

(8) Manufacturing waste such as electric arc furnace dusts, alu- 
minum dross, etc. For example, steel making industries pro- 
duce  large  amounts  of  dust  and  sludge  which  contains 
metals  (for  example,  iron,  zinc,  lead,  molybdenum,  nickel, 

chromium,  etc.).  The  quantities  of  theses  metals  are  often 
very  motivating  for  their  extraction  and  recycling.  Leacha- 
bility  of  harmful  fractions  from  these  wastes  make  them 
hazardous.  Basic  oxygen  furnaces,  blast  furnaces  and  elec- 
tric  arc  furnaces  used  in  manufacturing  sectors  produce 
huge  amount  of  dust  and  slag  which  need  to  be  treated 
[81] . These wastes can be transformed to glassy slag cou- 
pled with the recovery of metals by oxide reduction. Ther- 
mal  plasma  technology  offers  all  these  features.  Reducing 
plasma gas or reducing additive such as carbon may be em- 
ployed  for  reduction  of  metal  oxides.  On  the  other  hand, 
zinc  and  lead  can  be  condensed  from  the  vapor  phase  or 
can be collected as a melt [77] . Post recycling, vitriﬁcation 
is also carried out as enabled by elevated plasma temper- 
atures. Electroplating industries also produces waste water 
containing nickel chromium and zinc. They can be treated 
by DC non-transferred arc at reduced pressures employing 
various plasma gas environments [ 73 , 82 ]. Furthermore, ThP 
pathways (plasma arc technology) are employed to dissolve 
and recover the aluminum dross produced as a by-product 
in aluminum smelting processes. It should be noted that the 
plasma  treatment  is  especially  useful  in  the  case  of  auto- 
mobile shredder waste as the high amount of metal content 
present in the waste can easily be separated from other ma- 
terials and recovered [ 83 , 84 ]. 

3.2. Issues related with some kinds of wastes and their treatment 

Some  of  the  wastes  mentioned  in  Section  3.1  are  associated 
with speciﬁc issues and consequently, should be dealt with great 
care.  For  example,  ThP  pyrolysis  with  non-transferred  plasma 
torches (as high heat ﬂuxes are not required) can easily treat haz- 
ardous liquids and gases but their exhaust contains gases which 
could contribute to global warming and ozone destruction and that 
need to be treated appropriately [ 9 , 48 , 64 ]. 

In general, decontamination is desired (often required) for all 
contaminated solid wastes coupled with volume reduction and en- 
capsulation of inorganics. Most solid waste treatment facilities em- 
ploy transferred arc technology on account of the requirement for 
high heat ﬂuxes. The exception to this approach is provided by Eu- 
roplasma and by Westinghouse [85] . They employ non-transferred 
plasma  torch  which  provide  a  part  of  the  process  heat  for  fur- 
naces while rest of the heat is either provided by the partial com- 
bustion of coke or of the caloriﬁc content of the wastes. Another 
exceptional approach is pursued by Pyrogenesis for the treatment 
of shipboard waste where plasma is employed to provide reaction 
heat in a minimal space [ 86 , 87 ]. 

Two considerable limitations of transferred arc technology are 
the very high concentration of heat ﬂux over a small area, and the 
requirement  of  electrically  conducting  waste.  RETECH  eliminated 

10

the  former  limitation  by  stirring  the  waste  in  a  rotating  reactor 
[ 9 , 88 ].  Tetronics  mitigated  this  limitation  by  moving  the  plasma 
torch  whereas  other  companies  installed  multiple  arcs  in  series 
[ 9 , 48 ]. The second limitation can be overcome by employing either 
of the three pathways: (1) by initially operating the torch in non- 
transferred mode until the waste material has ample conductivity, 
(2) by inserting a metal strip in the waste which may serve as an- 
ode until the waste become conducting or (3) by using multiple 
arcs where an initial arc can be generated between the two elec- 
trodes heating the waste indirectly until it can conduct the current 
[85] . 

4. Advanced thermal plasma technologies for waste treatment 
with energy and material recovery 

Thermal plasma assisted waste treatment has emerged as one 
of the waste treatment technologies in current era on account of 
several inherent characteristics. They can be employed to treat a 
very wide spectrum of waste because of their high heat ﬂuxes at 
elevated temperatures coupled with high ﬂuxes of reactive species. 
In addition, fast reaction times provide large throughput even with 
a  small  scale  reactor.  Furthermore,  the  reforming  of  toxic  com- 
pounds from the species exiting the reactor is lowered consider- 
ably  due  to  steep  thermal  gradients  which  permit  fast  quench- 
ing rates. Plasma gasiﬁcation and pyrolysis are widely employed to 
treat a variety of waste with or without energy and material recov- 
ery. ThPs are also used for compaction and vitriﬁcation. Moreover, 
they are employed to recover metals and other material, as well as 
energy from waste streams. In some cases, plasma heating is also 
coupled with some other thermal technology such as incineration 
or resistive heating to enhance process eﬃciency and an interest- 
ing account of this coupling can be found elsewhere [89] . 

It  should  be  noted  that  a  plasma  torches  operate  simultane- 
ously both as plasma-chemical and as a thermal apparatus. Mainly, 
three  types  of  reactions  take  place  during  the  gasiﬁcation  pro- 
cess, namely, thermal cracking, partial oxidation and reforming re- 
actions. The ﬁrst reaction is thermal cracking where the complex 
molecules are dissociated into lighter molecules, forming hydrocar- 
bon gases and hydrogen. These reactions are endothermic. 

The  second  type  of  reactions  generate  combustible  gases  by 
partial oxidation. These partial oxidation reactions essentially form 
carbon monoxide, and limit the formation of carbon dioxide and 
water. Carbon dioxide and water are complete oxidation products, 
and therefore, have a negative inﬂuence on the caloriﬁc value of 
synthesis gas. Furthermore, the metals contained as the inorganic 
fraction  of  the  waste  also  undergo  partial  oxidation.  It  is  worth 
mentioning that it is essential to control the amount of oxygen en- 
tering the reactor to ﬁx all the carbon molecules and optimize the 
CO/CO 
2  ratio. All of these partial oxidation reactions are exother- 
mic in nature. 

The third type of reactions are reforming reactions which are 
endothermic. The  reactions between the products  resulting from 
different reactions, group the components into new sets. For in- 
stance,  the  reaction  between  carbon  and  water  to  form  carbon 
monoxide and hydrogen, or the carbon can react with carbon diox- 
ide to form carbon monoxide. These reactions contribute both to 
the formation of a combustible gas, and to the consumption of ox- 
idized material which would otherwise decrease the caloriﬁc value 
of the synthesis gas. 

In addition to the energy consumption by different types of re- 
actions, the factors such as ‘speed of reactions’ (kinetics) and ‘de- 
gree of completion of reactions’ (thermodynamics) must be taken 
into account. Taken together, these three factors indicate that the 
formation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen increases as the reac- 
tor temperature rises. 

Due  to  the  high  temperature  and  high  energy  density  gener- 
ated by thermal plasma, a large throughput can be accommodated 
with  a  small  scale  reactor.  The  high  ﬂux  densities  generated  by 
the plasma at the reactor boundaries lead to a rapid attainment of 
steady state conditions, effectively reducing the start-up and shut- 
down times [90] . Hybrid torches such as the one employed at In- 
stitute of Plasma Physics have numerous advantages vis-à-vis other 
torches ( Fig. 16 ). Due to the principle of arc stabilization by a wa- 
2 O + 0.2 
ter vortex, the ﬂow rate of plasma gas (typically 0.3 g/s H 
g/s Ar) is very low, but the plasma enthalpy is higher than 200 
MJ/kg, and the mean plasma temperature is higher than 150 0 0 K 
[48] . By changing the argon ﬂow rate, the hybrid torch provides 
the possibility of controlling the parameters of the plasma jet and 
the plasma composition (O–H–Ar) in a wide range from high en- 
thalpy, low density plasmas typical for water stabilized torches to 
lower enthalpy, higher density plasmas generated in gas stabilized 
torches. An important characteristic feature of this hybrid torch is 
the very low mass ﬂow rate of plasma. As low amount of plasma 
carries  high  energy,  the  power  needed  for  heating  of  plasma  to 
reaction  temperature  is  very  low,  and  the  eﬃciency  of  utilizing 
plasma power for waste valorization is extremely high. 

Commonly, air and nitrogen are employed as plasma gases. The 
advantage of these gases is the low cost and in case of nitrogen, an 
additional advantage of low erosion rate of torch electrodes. These 
gases are used especially in systems with high power torches. The 
main  problem  is  a  dilution  of  produced  syngas  by  nitrogen  and 
consequently, low caloriﬁc content of syngas [48] . Steam or CO 
2 
are used when better quality of syngas (basically mixture of H 
2 
and CO) is needed. The presence of oxygen in plasma gas leads to 
higher erosion rate of electrodes which results in lower life time of 
the torch. Other gases such as methane or other hydrocarbons are 
also sometimes employed. 

It is worth noting that the ﬂow rate of plasma gas in plasma 
torch is mainly determined by the necessity to reduce plasma tem- 
perature and consequently, to reduce the overheating of torch elec- 
trodes and nozzles [ 48 , 91 , 92 ]. This determines minimum ﬂow rate 
for a given arc power. However, higher reaction rates and higher 
energy eﬃciency is achieved in plasma reactor with high plasma 
temperatures and enthalpies, which are achieved for low plasma 
gas ﬂow rates. An optimum plasma gas composition and ﬂow rate 
must be found for speciﬁc torch and reactor conditions and treated 
material. 

In general, a thermal plasma assisted solid waste disposal sys- 

tem consists of the following subsystems: 

(a) Thermal plasma reactor: A vessel with the supply of ther- 
mal plasma coupled with power supply, cooling water sup- 
ply and gas supplies. It also has control and data acquisi- 
tion  equipment.  Moreover,  it  has  continuous  collection  of 
slag and metal at the bottom. 

(b) Auxiliary combustion chamber: It assists in complete gasi- 
ﬁcation of soot due to ample residence time at high tem- 
peratures. Thermal energy is either supplied by a low-power 
non-transferred plasma or by a burner. 

(c) Quenching chamber: It offers quenching of the exiting gases 
by some liquid (usually water) to prevent the generation of 
furans and dioxins. 

(d) Cyclone: It is employed to remove the particulates. 
(e) Filters: They are used to eliminate small particulates. 
(f) Scrubber: It is used to remove acidic gases. 
(g) Activated carbon ﬁlter: It is employed to remove heavy met- 

als. 

(h) Fan: It is used to produce sub-atmospheric pressures in the 

entire system. 

(i) Hydrogen sulﬁde absorber (depending upon the waste). 
(j) Waste preparation system (depending upon the waste).

4.1. Gasiﬁcation/pyrolysis 

2 + CO 

2 + CH 

Pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation are two cardinal routes to treat waste 
material eﬃciently and in eco-friendly manner employing ThP. Py- 
rolysis is deﬁned as the breaking of chemical components with the 
application of thermal energy provided by the ThP, without oxida- 
tion. On the other hand, plasma gasiﬁcation is the production of 
fuel gas (CO + H 
4 + other gases in minor amounts) 
by the incomplete oxidation of the material. The fuel gas has mul- 
tiple uses including the production of H 
2 , production of chemicals 
and fuels (e.g. Fisher Tropsch fuels, Dimethyl Ether, Synthetic Nat- 
ural Gas, etc.) generation of electricity via gas engines, combustion 
in sterling engine, generation of steam to run a steam turbine, etc. 
The  cardinal  objective  of  gasiﬁcation  is  to  generate  fuel  gas 
(product gas). It should be noted that all the carbon and hydro- 
gen atoms from the organics present in the waste can be used for 
fuel gas generation provided the waste and the produced gases are 
heated to an amply high temperature. Maximum conversion eﬃ- 
ciency  (waste  to  fuel  gas)  is  obtained  when  all  carbon  is  trans- 
2 ) is added 
formed to CO. An oxidizing agent (O 
when  the  carbon  molar  fraction  is  higher  than  the  oxygen  mo- 
lar  fraction  to  avoid  the  generation  of  solid  carbon  and  guaran- 
tee complete carbon gasiﬁcation. Eqs. (15) –(17) represent common 
gasiﬁcation pathways [48] :

centrations of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in the processed waste 
material M with mass fractions of C, H

o respectively. The resultant composition of reaction products is a 
function of many variables such as composition of waste, plasma, 
added gases, temperature etc. The elevated plasma temperatures 
and high enthalpies aid in establishing thermodynamic equilibrium 
inside the plasma reactor. Consequently, the ﬁnal composition of 
generated gases can be obtained via thermodynamic computations.

rolysis and gasiﬁcation simplistically, respectively. 

2 and O 

Detailed investigation of a wide variety of waste and other ma- 
terials  was  conducted  at  the  Institute  of  Plasma  Physics  of  the 
Czech  Academy  of  Sciences  by  Hrabovsky  et  al.  [93]  employing 
steam plasma. Materials tested were ﬁr sawdust, wooden pellets, 
sunﬂower seeds skins, lignite powder, polyethylene pellets, shred- 
ded waste plastics from bottles, RDF and low temperature pyrolysis 
oils from used tires. All materials were processed under the same 
conditions in a reactor with a volume of 0.2 m 3 . The power of the 
plasma torch was between 110 and 140 kW with an eﬃciency of 
65%, therefore, plasma enthalpy ﬂow was between 72 and 91 kW. 
The temperature of the reactor walls was in the range of 1100–
1400  °C  with  18  g/m  as  the  mass  ﬂow  of  steam.  They  reported 
maximum H 
2 generation as 61% for coal and maximum LHV of the 
produced gas as 11.3 MJ/m 3 for RDF. 

Some  key  pyrolysis  and  gasiﬁcation  investigations  for  plasma 

waste treatment are depicted in Table 4 . 

Thermal  plasma  assisted  waste  treatment  is  dependent  upon 
numerous factors such as plasma power, reactor temperature, type 
of  plasma gas,  ﬂow  rate  of  plasma gas,  residence time  of  waste 
inside the reactor, physical and chemical properties of the waste, 
etc. The impact of all these factors was investigated by many re- 
searchers around the globe. Some examples are given below. 

Hrcak and co-authors [112] and, Yoon and co-authors [111] em- 
ployed microwave plasma whereas Tu and co-authors [105] used 
RF  plasma  and  demonstrated  that  the  conversion  ratio  of  waste 
material to syngas is directly dependent upon the power consump- 
tion of the plasma system and can reach up to 99% provided the 
power level is high. Huang and co-writers [38] used capacitive cou- 
pled RF plasma to treat tire wastes. They reported an indirect de- 
pendence of gasiﬁcation performance and conversion eﬃciency on 
the particle size; i.e., increasing the particle size decreased both 
the parameters. The conversion of waste was found to be between 
40 and 78% for particle sizes ranging from 200 μm to 600 μm. Uhm 
and  co-workers  [113]  and,  Shin  and  co-workers  [114]  employed 
MW plasma for coal gasiﬁcation. The former reported a cold gas 
eﬃciency of 84% at 1640 °C reactor temperature whereas the lat- 
ter demonstrated an increase in generated syngas for the increased 
ratio of the rates of steam ﬂow to coal ﬂow. In the Czech Academy 
of Sciences, Hlina and co-authors [115] employed 110 kW Ar-H 
2 O 
plasma system to evaluate the waste (woody biomass, oils, plas- 
tics) treatment. They demonstrated that the best performance is 
given by wood followed by plastics and oils. A parametric study 
was conducted by Yoon et al. [111] , taking glycerol as the feedstock 
and employing MW plasma system. They reported the highest cold 
2 /fuel ratio condition, but at the cost of 
gas eﬃciency at a zero O 
lowest carbon conversion (~80%). With a rise in O 
2 /fuel ratio a de- 
cline in the cold gas eﬃciency was observed with an increase in 
carbon conversion. The authors suggested to keep the O 
2 /fuel ra- 
tio between 0 and 0.4 in order to obtain optimum values for car- 
bon conversion and cold gas eﬃciency. In addition, it was demon- 
strated that when glycerol was fed to the reactor using a gas-liquid 
nozzle, the H 
2 and CO fractions were enhanced whereas the CO 
2 
content declined with an improvement in carbon conversion and 
cold  gas eﬃciency  by 4.5% and 7%,  respectively. In addition, the 
fuel droplet size, the mixing effect and the retention time inside 
the plasma ﬂames were reported as the critical factors that have 
a profound impact on the product gas yield and the gasiﬁcation 
eﬃciency. 

In a novel investigation, Wang and co-authors [116] investigated 
ThP assisted treatment of textile dyeing sludge (a hazardous waste 
with complex constituents) using a rotating DC arc plasma system 
with a rated power of 50 kW with CO 
2 and Ar as ﬂow gases. A uni- 
form and stable jet at around 30 0 0 K coupled with proper mixing 
of waste and working gas, are major two advantages of employing 
rotating arc. They reported carbon conversion eﬃciency as 99.9%, 
energy conversion eﬃciency as 71.8% and lower heating value of 
syngas as 8.91 MJ/Nm 3 for a feed rate of 36 g/min and a CO 
2 ﬂow 
rate of 14.08 g/min. They also demonstrated a volume reduction 
ratio of the sludge as 41.19%. The ﬁxing eﬃciency of the heavy met- 
als in the solids were reported to be more than 99% with the con- 
ﬁrmation from leaching tests that the solid products were harm- 
less in a wide environmental pH range. It is worth noting that this 
new pathway to treat textile dyeing sludge has eliminated all the 
ﬂipsides of conventional treatment technologies such as ineﬃcient 
degradation of harmful organics, incomplete ﬁxation of heavy met- 
als and water/soil contamination. 

Jamroz and co-workers [117] used a 1.8 kW MW plasma reac- 
tor for the disposal and steam reforming of tar compounds. They 
performed the experiments in a N 
2 stream on tar surrogates such 
as benzene, toluene and 1-methylnapthalene. They examined the 
impact of tar conversion, gas ﬂow rate and steam addition on con- 
version eﬃciency. With  the initial tar amounts of 10 g/Nm 3 ,  N 
2 
ﬂow at 30 L/min and steam-to-carbon ratio as 3, the process ef- 
ﬁciency was reported to be around 98%. The conversion eﬃciency 
was found to be inversely proportional to the tar amounts and gas 
ﬂow rate. The conversion rate was enhanced with an increase in 
steam addition. Acetylene, soot, benzene derivatives and cyanides 
were found to be the main products of plasma assisted tar con-

2 by reducing 

Thermal  plasma  assisted  thermochemical  treatment  is  espe- 
cially  useful  for  radioactive  wastes  on  account  of  the  availabil- 
ity  of  high  ﬂuxes  of  reactants  from  a  plasma  to  drive  the  de- 
sired thermochemical reactions. Based on this principle, many pro- 
cesses are in their infancy stage. They are based on selective oxi- 
dation, ﬂuorination, chlorination or evaporation to isolate radioac- 
tive fractions from the waste. In the water cleaning systems of nu- 
clear plants, the ion exchange resins are treated where gasiﬁcation 
of carbon-rich material and oxidation of radioactive material (Co 
and Cs) employing an O 
2  plasma take place. In this process, not 
only hazardous fractions are trapped but also a weight reduction 
of about 95% is achieved [60] . In addition, metal alloys contami- 

nated with radioactive substances are treated with selective ﬂuori- 
nation and chlorination, for instance, uranium contaminated struc- 
tural components undergo ﬂuorination and gasiﬁcation, or cobalt 
undergoes  ﬂuorination  followed  by  the  removal  of  ﬂuoride  with 
water  [ 60 , 118 , 119 ].  Furthermore,  radioactive  Nb  can  be  isolated 
from  Nb–Zr  alloy  by  plasma  ﬂuorination  of  Zr  at  around  3500–
4500  K  [118] .  These  and  alike  processes  employ  plasmas  gener- 
ated  by  means  such  as  microwaves,  dielectric  barrier  discharge, 
DC  plasma  torch,  containing  high  concentrations  of  Cl  and  F 
reactants.

ber  of  studies  especially  demonstration  projects  employed  ﬁxed 
bed reactors. Entrained ﬂow reactors were the second choice of the 
researchers whereas few investigations were also done using spout 
/ spout-ﬂuid reactors. 

(a) Fixed/moving bed 
Fixed or moving bed reactors have the simplest design with a 
bed of solid waste in particles form, a solid waste feeding unit, ash 
removal unit and gas exit system [95] . The waste is kept in the 
center of the ﬁxed bed reactor while waste enters from the top 
(or side) of the reactor in case of moving bed, considering batch 
mode for the former and continuous feed mode for the latter. The 
organic fraction is transformed to fuel gas and exit at the top of 
the reactor whereas the ash and the metals form the slag at the 
bottom of the reactor, after they come in contact with the ionized 
gas. Fixed bed is depicted in Fig. 10 whereas moving bed is shown 
in Fig. 11 . 

Typically,  two  different  approaches  are  linked  with  ﬁxed  bed 
/ moving bed design, namely, location of plasma outside the bed 
and immersion of plasma inside the bed. Westinghouse and Hi- 
tachi  employed  the  former  strategy  where  a  water-cooled  non- 
transferred torch is placed outside the reactor. The gas at elevated 

temperature ﬂows from the torch to the waste inside the reactor 
and gasiﬁes it. In the latter strategy, plasma torch (either trans- 
ferred or non-transferred) is placed inside the reactor. The power 
source in either case is DC. Both the approaches were applied to 
treat  MSW  and  medical  wastes  at  small  scale  [ 95 , 96 ].  Thermal 
plasma waste processing unit was developed at Utashinai, Japan 
in  2002  to  process  MSW  and  automobile  shredder  residue  with 
a capacity of 170 tons/d, which has now grown to 300 tons/d. It 
generates 7.9 MWh electricity selling 4.3 MWh back to grid. An- 
other such plant with Westinghouse design is currently operating 
in Rome, Italy with a capacity of 336 tons/d. Fixed bed reactors 
were also employed in such investigations which required longer 
contact between plasma jet and waste [49] . 

The foremost advantages of this kind of reactor design are sim- 
ple construction, eﬃcient heat transfer to the waste and continu- 
ous contact with the plasma resulting in the ability to treat almost 
any kind of waste. On the other hand, the continuous contact be- 
tween plasma jet and the waste limits further improvement in ar- 
eas where selectivity of the intermediate products is desired. 

(b) Entrained ﬂow bed 
The commonly employed design in major studies was entrained 
ﬂow bed reactor where waste in the pulverized form was fed into 
the tail ﬂame of plasma jet [ 11 , 15 , 38 , 51 , 97 , 98 , 105 , 106 , 108 , 120-124 ]. 
This design is considered as a unique multiphase ﬂow reactor de- 
sign with a high potential especially for processes where elevated 
temperature, ultra-short contact time reactions where speciﬁc in-

termediate products are required. It is usually employed for coal 
pyrolysis in hydrogen plasma to generate acetylene. It is also used 
for cracking polymer such as polypropylene to monomer. In cur- 
rent  years,  some  investigations  are  also  done  on  waste  process- 
ing  employing  entrained  ﬂow  reactor  [ 11 , 15 , 97 , 105 , 106 ].  A  sim- 
ple schematic showing entrained ﬂow bed reactor is reﬂected in 
Fig. 12 . 

Zhao and co-authors [98] used an arc entrained ﬂow reactor to 
evaluate the degree of pyrolysis at different times and to exam- 
ine the generation of different products at different stages of py- 
rolysis. The plasma generator was placed at the upper portion of 
the reactor apparatus whereas waste material injector was placed 
below  the  plasma  generator.  Pulverized  waste  was  injected  into 
the  plasma  jet  using  Ar.  The  reacting  biomass  feed  and  plasma 
jet then entered an extended reaction zone. Four sampling areas 
were  made  at  different  locations  in  the  reaction  cavity  vis-à-vis 
core  temperatures and residence times,  with a 200  mm spacing 
4 were re- 
between any two sampling points. H 
ported to be the main gases. They achieved a carbon conversion 
eﬃciency of 79% and oxygen conversion of about 72% with speciﬁc 
power consumption under optimal conditions as 3.7 kWh/Nm 3 .

The key advantages of entrained ﬂow design are the short res- 
idence time of solids in the plasma resulting in rapid heating and 
quenching rate are achieved. The other unique features are plug 
ﬂow reactor performance and comparatively uniform ﬂow struc- 
ture. The limitation is low energy eﬃciency on account of conduc- 
tive, convective and radiative losses. In addition, electrode pollu- 
tion of DC plasma reduces the product purity and also limits the 
generation of desired intermediate products [ 51 , 108 ]. 

(c) Spout/spout-ﬂuid bed 
Basically,  the  underlying  principle  of  a  plasma  spout  bed  is 
same as of a standard spout bed. The major difference is that in 
a  plasma  spout  bed,  the  heat  for  the  process  is  given  by  a  DC 
plasma jet which forms the spout as shown in Fig. 13 [ 26 , 99 , 100 ]. 
On the other hand, a plasma spout-ﬂuid bed reactor is a hybrid 
reactor with the characteristics of ﬂuidized bed and plasma spout 
bed. It combines the plasma ﬂow of a single central opening as 
in  a  spout  bed  with  the  supplementary  ﬂuid  ﬂow  through  the 
distributor plate as in a ﬂuidized bed [ 101 , 109 ]. They are mainly 
employed for combustion and gasiﬁcation processes, for instance, 
for hydrocarbon pyrolysis, for minerals processing and for materi- 
als processing. As far as plasma generators are concerned vis-à-vis 
spout and spout-ﬂuid bed, DC arc torch, MW system and induc- 
tive plasma torch are employed. In general, DC arc torches are used 
for hydrocarbon pyrolysis or minerals processing whereas RF sys- 
tems are employed for gas and materials synthesis [ 26 , 99-101 , 109 ].

located outside the bed whereas Fig. 14 (b) shows the same reactor 
with plasma jet immersed inside the bed. 

The major advantages of plasma spout bed are higher rate of 
mixing, better solid-ﬂuid contact, improved heat and mass transfer 
with high conversion eﬃciencies with short residence times. The 
cardinal limitation is lack of bed stability. 

4.1.2. Different plasma working gases 

2 , N 

Gases are used in many plasma generating systems. These gases 
(air, Ar, He, H 
2 , steam, etc.) are called as plasma working gases. 
Heat and momentum transfer of the plasma are functions of the 
type and characteristics of the plasma gas. It can be an inert gas or 
it may take part in the reaction. One should look for the heating 
value and cost effectiveness while selecting a plasma gas for a par- 
ticular system. Usually, plasma gasiﬁcation of wastes with signiﬁ- 
cant carbon content is carried out in the presence of steam to ob- 
2 rich high quality product gas. Researchers have employed 
tain H 
steam reforming to accomplish this objective [ 49 , 125 ]. In addition, 
ThP pyrolysis of waste polymer can generate good quality syngas 
by the addition of water steam in the reaction system. It was found 
2 or Ar plasma 
to produce large amounts of CO as compared to N 
2 fraction and total gas 
pyrolysis with a considerable increase in H 
yield. 

(a) Mixed gas-water steam 
In  industrial  applications,  the  major  consideration  for  any 
plasma generator system is to avoid electrodes damage by plasma 
gas and consequently, enhance the life of the electrodes. In DC/AC 
plasma systems, it is diﬃcult as well as unsuitable to employ pure 
water steam as plasma gas. Therefore, Ar and N 
2  are commonly 
used gases to enhance the stability. The ﬂipside is that the product 
gas contains large amounts of N 
2 or Ar which signiﬁcantly reduces 
2 or 
the caloriﬁc value of the fuel gas. On the other hand, if pure O 
water steam is employed, the caloriﬁc content of the product gas 
increases. 

Many studies have employed a combination of water steam or 
2 and Ar as the DC/AC plasma working gas [ 104 , 126 , 127 ]. The In- 
N 
stitute of Plasma Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences devel-

oped a unique DC plasma torch where the electric arc is stabilized 
by a water vortex in combination with gas ﬂow [127] . The plasma 
gas consists of steam with a small amount of Ar. The ﬂow rate of 
plasma gas is very low with mean plasma temperature of more 
than 150 0 0 K and plasma enthalpy as high as 20 0 MJ/kg. The ma- 
jor advantage of hybrid gas-water stabilization is the ﬂexibility in 
controlling the parameters of the plasma jet and the plasma com- 
position in a very wide range from high enthalpy low density plas- 
mas to low enthalpy high density plasmas. The high temperature 
and plasma composition in such system are very favorable for the 
waste  treatment  processes.  Furthermore,  this  hybrid  torch  has  a 
low mass ﬂow rate of plasma, which in turn reduces the power 
needed to heat the plasma to reaction temperature which ﬁnally 
enhances the eﬃciency of plasma utilization for waste processing. 

(b) Water steam 
Microwave  or  radio  frequency  plasma  systems  without  the 
problem  of  electrode  corrosion  employ  oxidizing  plasma  gases 
such as O 
2  or water steam [ 38 , 128 ]. Sekiguchi et al. [128] inves- 
tigated  plastic  treatment  in  a  MW  system  employing  steam  as 
plasma gas along with Ar. The reactor operated at 2.45 GHz and 
600 W. Polyethylene was treated in batch operation. When steam 
addition took place, the color of plasma was changed from bluish- 
white to reddish. Emission spectra revealed several high peaks in 
Ar plasma between 700 and 850 nm generated from Ar excitations. 
When steam was added, the intensities of these spectra were re- 
duced  and  spectra  derived  from  H 
2 O  dissociation  were  reﬂected 
at 300, 650 and 780 nm corresponding to OH, H and O with OH 
exhibiting the strongest peak. The major products generated were 
CO and H 
2 . While treating PVC by using steam plasma, Cl was cap- 
tured by H and transformed into HCl which can easily be removed 
by scrubber. Therefore, this process can be adopted for any kind of 
waste including those containing halogens with simultaneous gen- 
eration of fuel gas. 
(c) Methane 
For special purposes, apart from other gases, methane can also 
be used as a plasma gas. Microwave plasma system was employed 
to transform brown coal to important fuels and fuel gas (C 
2 , 
CO) in a single step using methane plasma gas [129] . It upgraded 
the carbon content of the residue without the application of high 
pressure H

4.2. Compaction and vitriﬁcation 

Plasma compaction and vitriﬁcation of solid wastes can be de- 
ﬁned  as  the  melting  of  inorganics  (and  gasiﬁcation  of  organics) 
present in the waste to remove voids and bind toxic material in 
a  ceramic  matrix  by  the  addition  of  suitable  ﬂuxes.  A  block  di- 
agram  representing  the  plasma  vitriﬁcation  process  is  shown  in 
Fig.  15 .  Vitriﬁed  ceramics  with  low  leaching  rates  are  produced 
with the aid of elevated plasma temperatures which enable melt- 
ing by high heat ﬂuxes. Some important studies related to plasma 
assisted waste vitriﬁcation are listed in Table 5 .

2 O, 16.2% CaO and 7.7% Fe 

Thermal plasmas are employed worldwide to treat, recycle and 
utilize incineration residues, i.e. ﬂy ash and bottom ash. As major 
hazardous substances are contained in ﬂy ash, its eﬃcient treat- 
ment is required and the standards are regulated by governmen- 
tal norms. At a temperature range at the bottom of the reactor of 
around 1650–1800 K, inhomogeneous bottom ash can be converted 
into homogeneous glassy slag. Post vitriﬁcation, the average com- 
3 , 52.1% SiO 
position of the product comprises of 12.2% Al 
2 , 2.3% 
3 and on an average, 82% 
MgO, 4.2% Na 
Fe, 12% Cu and small fractions of P, S and C are recovered [141- 
144] . Numerous investigations vis-à-vis mobility and volatilization 
of toxic compounds, potential to reuse and removal of hazardous 
elements have been carried out. In a latest study by Sobiecka and 
co-authors [145] , hospital incineration ﬂy ash, which is considered 
a hazardous waste, was transformed with the aid of ThP to a glassy 
product,  which  can  be  landﬁlled  without  any  adverse  effect  on 
the environment, or can also be turned to colored tiles with the 
addition  of  some  additives.  The  objectives  of  the  study  were  to 
optimize  temperature  and  energy  to  enhance  process  economics 
and to stabilize the produced vitriﬁcates (colored and non-colored 
tiles) by differing the composition of waste mixtures. A 20 kW arc 
plasma was employed using Ar as the purge gas. The leaching tests 
proved the immobility of toxic materials in both kind of tiles. In 
addition, compression strength of the tiles without the addition of 
commercial pigments in the raw material was found to be higher 
than the ones where the pigments were added. They also reported 
that the physical and chemical properties along with the internal 
structures of the vitriﬁcates are a function of the composition of 
the wastes.

Post  vitriﬁcation,  the  cardinal  crystalline  phase  of  the  slag  is 
found  to  be  Ca 
2  nearly  1 
[ 146 , 147 ].  Ioanna  et  al.  [140]  investigated  the  formation  of  geo- 
polymer  glass  composites  of  considerable  strength  from  air  pol- 
lution control (APC) residues by employing DC plasma treatment. 
The compressive strength was reported to be around 130 MPa with 
a high density of 2070 kg/m 3 and low porosity. Kuo et al. [131] ex- 
amined the properties (crystalline characteristics and mass distri- 
bution of metals) of the generated slag after plasma vitriﬁcation of 
MSW incinerator ﬂy ash located in Southern Taiwan. They demon- 
strated that the low boiling point metals such as Cd, Zn, Pb va- 
porized in ﬂue gas as particulate phase whereas metals with high 
boiling points remained in the slag. High concentrations of Zn (226 
g/kg) and Pb (315 g/kg) made it attractive to reclaim the partic- 
ulate  phase.  The  Institute  of  Nuclear  Energy  Research  in  Taiwan 
used a 100 kW non-transferred arc plasma to treat MSW incin- 
erator ash where Ar was employed for ignition while N 
2 was used 
as a carrier gas [ 12 , 19 ]. The vitriﬁed slag captured all the heavy 
metals  originally  present  in  the  feedstock  and  it  had  very  low 
leachability. 

In an interesting investigation, Sobiecka et al. [148] used a ThP 
arc  system  to  treat  a  mixture  (in  varying  fractions)  of  two  haz- 
ardous wastes, namely MSW incinerator ﬂy ash and Cr rich sewage 
sludge  to  generate  less  toxic  inert  glassy  products.  The  leaching 
tests results were within the limits set by European agencies. Silica, 
Ca and Al formed around 72% of the ﬂy ash composition whereas 
about 95% on the inorganics in the sludge contained Zn, Cr and 
Cu. It was demonstrated that the energy required and the melting 
temperature are inversely proportional to the amount of sludge in 
the feedstock mixture. Moreover, hardness tests reﬂected that the 
hardness is directly dependent upon the amount of ﬂy ash in the 
mixture whereas the sludge fraction reduces the hardness. 

Fibre reinforced polymer matrix composites (FRPMC) are ther- 
mosetting or aramid polymers, therefore, they are non-combustible 
in  nature.  They  are  usually  employed  in  maritime  applications, 
for  e.g.,  in  boat  hulls,  superstructures,  chemical  tanks,  aircrafts, 
etc. Due to their unique chemical composition, conventional waste 
treatment  pathways  are  not  feasible  to  dispose  them.  Thermal 
plasma vitriﬁcation not only disposes them but also produces glass 
ceramics which can be utilized as construction materials. Typical 
composition  of  glass  ceramics  is  provided  in  Table  6 .  Chu  et  al. 
[70] evaluated the feasibility of plasma treatment on a mixture of 
FRPMC, gill net and waste glass using DC non-transferred arc sys- 
tem with Ar to generate the plasma followed by air as the main 
ambient gas. Different ratios of the wastes were examined for 1 h 
at 1523 K and all the slags produced were amorphous. Glass ce- 
ramics were generated by heat treating the vitriﬁed slag with the 

addition of additives. They reported that the leachability tests are 
well below the speciﬁed limits. 

In Cenon, France, the compaction of incinerator residue is car- 
ried  out  by  Europlasma  employing  a  non-transferred  arc  system 
with 500 kW torch capacity with air as the plasma gas [9] . The in- 
cinerator treats around 120 0 0 0 tons/y of MSW whereas the plasma 
reactor processes around 3650 tons/y of the ﬂy ash generated from 
the incineration plant. The energy consumed is around 1300 kWh/t 
of  ﬂy  ash.  Many  large-scale  installations  are  based  in  Japan,  for 
instance, a plasma plant at Shimonoseki which treats around 42 
tons/d  of  ﬂy  ash  and  bottom  ash  employing  a  reactor  with  two 
torches, each rated at 1.3 MW. The energy required is about 800 
kWh/t.  All  these  reactors  are  functioning  for  many  years  with  a 
nominal maintenance requirement of 1 h for every 300 h of oper- 
ation. 

The Inertam plant at St. Denis, France was designed by Euro- 
plasma to process asbestos containing waste using three plasma 
torches placed at different locations with 500 kW as the capacity 
of one torch while other two are rated at 2 MW each [150] . The 
energy consumption is 1300 kWh/t. The vitriﬁed product is utilized 
as road construction material. It is worth noting that Europlasma 
employs a post combustion chamber in many of their designs to 
meet the incinerator regulations by ensuring complete combustion 
of carbon containing gases. 

With the tightening regulations to prevent ocean pollution, the 
compaction of shipboard waste has become a grave issue. The ad- 
vantage with the plasma system is the requirement of minimal vol- 
ume and small footprints. In this context, Pyrogenesis Corp., Mon- 
treal, Canada developed a plasma system (non-transferred plasma 
torch) for the volume reduction of shipboard waste with a process- 
ing capacity of 200 kg/h [151-153] . The waste undergoes pretreat- 
ment  in  which  the  metallic  fraction  is  separated  from  the  com- 
bustible content, followed by the shredding and milling of the lat- 
ter. The torch operates at 109 kW and supplies around 15% of the 
energy whereas the remaining 85% comes from the caloriﬁc con- 
tent  of  the  waste  [153] .  The  energy  requirement  is  around  665 
kWh/t excluding the energy required for waste preparation. Rapid 
start-up  time,  rapid shut-down  time,  small reactor  size,  low  gas 
ﬂow rate, no requirement of fuel gas, etc. are some of the attrac- 
tive features of this system. 

Tetronics, Faringdon, UK, developed a twin torch reactor design 
where one of the torches acts an anode while other serves as cath- 
ode [9] . The electrodes can be water cooled metal or graphite. The 
waste material is injected into the plasma between the two elec- 
trodes. The twin arc arrangement can be operated either in non- 
transferred mode or in transferred mode, depending upon the con- 
ditions  and  the  requirements.  A  twin  torch  reactor  is  employed 

18

with  a  rated  power  of  250  kW  to  process  bottom  ash  at  a  rate 
of 50 kg/h [88] . The speciﬁc energy consumption is around 50 0 0 
kWh/t. Comprehensive leaching tests have proved that the leaching 
rates of heavy metals are far below the permissible limits [ 86 , 88 ]. 
A large scale installation with 2800 kW capacity treats 3300 kg/h 
of  ash.  Although  ash  processing  is  the  major  application  of  this 
kind of torches, they are also employed to process sewage sludge, 
solid hospital waste, low level radioactive waste, incinerator ashes, 
etc. in an installation with rated capacity of 480 kW at the rate of 
70 kg/h [9] . Tetronics has also addressed the issue of energy re- 
covery from large waste streams. The Gasplasma process which is 
a hybrid of ﬂuidized bed gasiﬁcation coupled with syngas cleaning 
by plasma, recovers more than half of the heat in the form of syn- 
gas [ 9 , 86 ]. Additionally, around 60% of the produced power can be 
exported. 

Vitriﬁcation  of  hazardous  and  non-hazardous  wastes  via  ThP 
treatment result into an inert product which meets the safety cri- 
teria set by European Union and consequently, it can be utilized 
as construction material or can be landﬁlled. The generated gran- 
ulated slag is usually employed to produce decorative permeable 
brick, pavement brick, and concrete aggregates whereas cast slag is 
used for interlocking blocks, tiles and bricks [ 66 , 154 ]. The products 
meet the performance criteria on account of their ample strength. 
The slag from a commercial plasma plant based in Japan is used to 
make water permeable blocks and pavement bricks as they satisfy 
the product standards and leaching norms [ 66 , 155 ]. Moreover, the 
plasma treatment of incinerator wastes results in a slag which can 
be transformed to value added product such as glass ceramics post 
heat treatment [ 88 , 156 ]. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  ThP  technology  should  not  only 
be weighed in terms of technical performance but should also be 
evaluated vis-à-vis process economics. In this perspective, ThP vit- 
riﬁcation suffers from a major drawback of employing the most us- 
able form of energy, namely, electricity. However, this limitation is 
countered by the fact that plasma treatment aids in saving landﬁll 
tax and simultaneously produces value added reusable by-products 
and end products, within the regulatory framework. Therefore, it 
should be seen as a recovery route rather than a disposal pathway 
for waste treatment. 

4.3. Recovery of metals 

Wastes containing metals such as e-waste, aluminum dross, zir- 
con, red mud, galvanic sludge, incinerated ash, etc. are quite dif- 
ﬁcult to deal with, however, they have immense potential for re- 
cycling. Worldwide researches are going on to develop metal re- 
covery  processes  to  enhance  the  economics  of  the  primary  pro- 
cess from which metal containing wastes are generated and to pre- 
vent environmental pollution. Conventional methods namely, py- 
rometallurgical (such as incineration, pyrolysis, melting, etc.) and 
hydrometallurgical have signiﬁcant limitations [ 157 , 158 ]. The for- 
mer technologies generate toxic gases along with dioxins and fu- 
rans whereas the latter generate a huge amount of acidic waste 
liquid  [159] .  Thermal  plasma  assisted  processes  employing  DC 
extended  transferred  arc  plasma  reactor,  DC  non-transferred  arc 
plasma torch, RF thermal plasma reactor, etc. are considered eco- 
friendly  and  eﬃcient  pathways  for  metal  recovery  from  wastes. 
Table 7 reﬂects some major investigations vis-à-vis metal reclama- 
tion and puriﬁcation. 

4.3.1. Metals from electronic waste 

E-waste  or  electronic  waste  is  derived  from  a  diverse  circuit 
board waste where engineering plastics are the main component 
containing huge fractions of heavy metals, namely, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, 
Cu  and  ﬂame  retardants.  Nowadays,  the  deployment  of  ThP  in 
a wide variety of studies has grown to recover the metals from 

wastes on account of inherent advantages such as very high tem- 
peratures which enable the separation of the slag metal, and the 
presence of reactive species to increase the reaction kinetics and 
reduce the reaction time. Rath and co-workers [40] employed a DC 
extended arc plasma torch system with a rated capacity of 35 kW 
to treat the e-waste (crushed form) via pyrolysis. The reactor was 
operated between 1675 and 1875 K using Ar. During the treatment, 
the e-waste was melted and the metals (Cu, Al and Fe) present in 
the form of mixture were then leached with the aid of HCl in the 
presence of H 

2 as depolarizer. 

2 O 

Few researchers [ 173 , 174 ] also performed e-waste treatment in- 
vestigations without any pretreatment. A sample weighing 17.4 kg 
was reduced by 71% where 10.6 kg solid products were remaining 
in which 7.1 kg was slag whereas 3.5 kg were recovered metals. It 
emphatically demonstrated the effectiveness of plasma application 
to e-waste for metals reclamation. They also reported the gener- 
ation of huge quantities of CO which may be employed as energy 
gas. This method was found to have high economic value with con- 
siderable energy eﬃciency [165] . 

4.3.2. Iron from red mud 

Investigators [41] have employed DC extended arc plasma sys- 
tem to recover Fe from red mud by reducing the dried red mud 
powder.  Lime  was  employed  as  the  ﬂux  agent  whereas  low  ash 
metallurgical coke was used as a reducing agent. The plasma re- 
actor temperature was between 1675 and 1875 K. They reported 
the  presence  of  metallic  iron  in  the  metal  phase  and  C,  Si,  O 
and  P  as  the  impurities  in  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  analysis.  Car- 
bon came from incomplete reaction of the reducing agent, i.e. coke. 
The metal recovery rate was a function of reducing agent, alkalin- 
ity and reaction time. 

Rath  et  al.  [39]  used  a  plasma  arc  furnace  and  employed 
graphite (with ﬁxed C as 99%) as the reducing agent. Limestone, 
dolomite, ﬂuorite and pure calcium carbonate were used as ﬂux- 
ing agents in the study whereas Ar was the working gas. The ma- 
jor composition of red mud was Fe, Al, Si, Na and TiO 
2 with traces 
of S and P. The heat treatment was applied for 5–18 min. The re- 
sults demonstrated that the metal recovery rate enhanced till the 
treatment  time  was  15  min  and  then  gradually  started  decreas- 
ing.  The  concentration  of  the  reducing  agent  was  varied  from  9 
to 14%. It was reported that a concentration above 11% has nega- 
tive impact on the recovery rate. In addition, the energy consump- 
tion was found to have an inverse relationship with metal recovery 
rate. 

4.3.3. Metals from electroplating sludge 

Electroplating industries generate large amounts of electroplat- 
ing  sludge.  It  has  a  complex  composition  which  includes  Cr,  Fe, 
Ni, Cu, Zn along with heavy metal compounds and soluble salts 
[157] .  The  research  work  demonstrated  that  the  plasma  assisted 
treatment  recovers  heavy  metals  as  well  as  transforms  the  ex- 
cess sludge into an inert slag. Ramachandran et al. [73] employed 
DC  non-transferred  arc  plasma  (7–16  kW)  under  reduced  pres- 
sure  conditions  with  three  different  working  gases,  namely,  Ar- 
H 
2  to process electroplating sludge with recovery of 
metals. The powder was collected from the top, bottom and walls 
of the reactor post treatment and was treated to recover Zn, Cr 
and Ni.

Leal and co-workers [169] in their study employing DC ThP ex- 
posed the electroplating sludge (water content ~ 64%) to elevated 
temperatures which vitriﬁed the sludge and deactivated the met- 
als  such  as  Fe,  Zn  and  Cr.  They  used  both  transferred  and  non- 
transferred arc plasmas in two different sets of experiments with 
Ar as the working gas. The ThP pyrolysis was followed by leach- 
ing  tests  to  evaluate  the  quality  of  the  vitriﬁed  slag.  Fe,  Zn,  Al 
and Cr were reclaimed in signiﬁcant quantities. The investigations

demonstrated  that  transferred  arc  plasma  is  more  eﬃcient  than 
non-transferred arc plasma. However, the limitation with the for- 
mer is the diﬃculty to ignite. It should be noted that the addition 
of quartz sand is of paramount importance vis-à-vis inactivation of 
the metals. Moreover, the generated inert by-products can be dis- 
posed without any ecological risks or can be utilized as construc- 
tion materials. 

4.3.4. Metals from metallurgical waste 

Researchers [42] used a transferred arc plasma system to re- 
cover metals from zircons with air and Ar. It was found that the 
zircon disintegrated into zirconia and silica when it is exposed to 
a temperature of 1950 K or higher [ 162 , 175 ]. The rated power of 
the system was 25 kW. The investigators evaluated the impact of 
input power, processing time and other variables on the outcomes 
of the experiments. Zirconium oxide and zirconium were formed at 
low power and short treatment duration. With the enhancement in 
the input power coupled with control on treatment time, the de- 
composition rate of zircon was raised. It is on account of the fact 
that the input power is proportional to the arc temperature, which 
in turn increases the stability, thereby upsurges the heat transfer 
and consequently enhances the extent of disintegration of zircon 
[44] . Similarly, the decomposition of zircon increased when power 
remains the same but the duration of treatment is increased. Sil- 
ica  is  transformed  to  SiO  gas  leaving  zirconium  oxide  when  the 
heat treatment time was increased. It was also reported that the 
impact of plasma working gas was negligible at higher power. It 
was  noted  that  the  product  (zirconium  oxide)  was  a  monoclinic 
crystalline phase with amorphous silicon. The studies prove that 
the  ThPa  methods  are  better  than  the  conventional  methods  to 

reclaim metals from metallurgical wastes due to its high produc- 
tion rate, short treatment duration and bulk production ability. It 
is worth noting that the production eﬃciency can be further im- 
proved by altering the torch conﬁgurations and optimizing the op- 
erational conditions. 

4.3.5. Metals from slag 

The aluminum production process generates huge fractions of 
aluminum slag (dross) which contains large amounts (50 to 75%) 
of Al and consequently, this waste is termed as hazardous waste 
[9] . Thermal plasma process to recover Al is considered eﬃcient 
and eco-friendly. Researchers from the Brazilian Institute of Tech- 
nology employed 300 kW plasma torch to process aluminum slag 
and reclaim Al [176] . They reported an expenditure of 82% of in- 
put  energy  for  material  processing  as  compared  to  66%  in  the 
salt  furnace.  However,  the  aluminum  recovery  rate  in  the  salt 
furnace pathway was around 88% whereas plasma assisted route 
was 94%. 

Canada Alcan International Corp. employed the Westinghouse 
non-transferred arc plasma torch system in a plasma ignition ro- 
tary kiln device to reclaim Al from slag and scrap, using air as the 
plasma gas [ 30 , 161 ]. They did not add any additives rather they di- 
rectly heated the wastes which resulted in direct separation of Al 
from Al slag. The rate of recovery was exemplary with high quality 
Al and an extraction eﬃciency of almost 100%. On the other hand, 
the processed slag was value added and was used for building ma- 
terial and ceramic material. In another study, American Bock Group 
employed  an  AC  plasma  system  to  recover  Al  from  dross  [157] . 
They reported high rate of recovery with a comparatively stable 
process.

4.3.6. Metals from dust 

The electric arc furnaces are employed in steel making process. 
These furnaces produce huge amounts (16 kg of dust per ton of 
steel) of dust which have large quantities of heavy metals in the 
form  of  oxides  [ 177 , 178 ].  Consequently,  this  waste  is  not  only  a 
threat to the environment but also to the health of humans and 
animals. Plasma processes are gradually replacing the conventional 
processes (pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical) on account of 
the inherent advantages to treat the electric arc furnace dust. 

Tetronics  in  collaboration  with  Bethlehem  Steel  developed  a 
transferred arc plasma system with a rated capacity of 700 kW to 
treat the furnace dust with metals recovery [ 179 , 180 ]. Graphite was 
used as the cathode. The waste material (dust) was injected from 
the hollow cathode. The iron was reclaimed in the smelting fur- 
nace whereas Zn was recovered in the condenser. In another study, 
furnace dust was treated in a water cooled plasma torch melting 
furnace with the recovery of Cu and Co [160] . The process dealt 
with the lead containing blast furnace slag and recovered Pb, re- 
ducing the toxicity of the waste.

2 has 
4730 K. In addition, it was reported that the application of H

negligible impact on the reduction of SiO

ditions. When the SiO

hanced Al fraction in the collected material.

a small fraction of Cr from CrO

in the plasma melting temperature. In addition, the leachability of 
Cr in the slag was low on account of the fact that the chromium in 
the slag reacts with silica to form a stable product at elevated tem- 
peratures. Post plasma treatment reduced toxic CrO 
3 and 
Cr. The interconnected Cr-O-Si species was detected in the slag. In 
the temperature range of 110 0–130 0 K, the residence time was de- 
creased resulting in the reduction of more soluble Cr.

4.4. Carbon nanospheres (formation and) recovery 

Carbon nano-spheres (CNs) are available in different morpholo- 
gies  and  are  synthesized  in  diverse  ways.  For  instance,  Carbon 
Black (CB), one of the most useful CNs can be produced either by 
incomplete combustion or by thermal decomposition of hydrocar- 
bons [33] . Almost 95% of CB is being produced with the furnace 
process. This process relies on the incomplete combustion of differ- 
ent types of heavy carbonaceous feedstock and is characterized by 
2 emissions with an average amount of around 4 kg CO 
direct CO 
2 
eq. per kg of CB, giving rise to more than ﬁfty million tons of CO 
2 
emissions annually [9] . The carbon nano-spheres can also be syn- 
thesized by other technologies including ThP arc discharge, laser 
ablation, chemical vapor deposition, and plasma-enhanced chemi- 
cal vapor deposition [34] . The CNs have diverse applications such 
as reinforcing ﬁllers in tires and rubber products (belts, hoses, etc.), 
color pigment in plastics, paints and inks, on account of their me- 
chanical, thermal, optical and electrical properties. Another novel 
application of CNs is in the Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells, 

which represent a clean and eﬃcient alternative energy source. Re- 
cently, CN is also recognized as an advanced material for other ap- 
plications such as electrodes of the fuel cell, battery storage, ﬁller 
of  polymer,  nano-composite  of  solar  cell,  high  surface  area  cat- 
alysts, carbon adsorbent and super-capacitors [ 181 , 182 ]. Theoret- 
ically,  it  is  possible  to  synthesize  CNs  from  organic  wastes  with 
simultaneous H 
2 (or syngas) generation with the aid of ThP, pro- 
vided  right  process  conditions  are  met.  The  process  can  be  de- 
picted  as  follows:  organic  waste  +  ThP  →  CN  +  H 
2  (or  syn- 
gas) + vitreous slag. Many researchers [ 11 , 15 , 36 , 37 , 182 , 183 ] have 
produced high quality carbon nanospheres by ThP pyrolysis em- 
ploying a diverse range of wastes such as waste rubber, old tires, 
polymers etc. 

5. Mathematical modeling investigations 

The nature of the product, product composition and other gen- 
eral performance measures such as process economics and energy 
eﬃciency  in  ThP  assisted  waste  treatment  processes  depend  on 
several factors like the selection of a suitable plasma torch, plasma 
gas, concentration and ﬂow rate of feedstock and other variables. 
Operational conditions such as pressure, temperature and gas ﬂow 
inside  the  reactor  need  to  be  optimized  to  achieve  the  desired 
performance.  Evaluation  of  optimal  conditions  is  frequently  car- 
ried out through experiments which are quite costly and time con- 
suming [184] . The solution to this problem is partially provided by 
mathematical modelling, where models can be generated to assess 
a wide spectrum of conditions, quickly and cheaply [185] . The sim- 
ulation work saves time and resources and imparts qualitative data 
for real-life scenarios, although not as accurately as the experimen- 
tal work [186] . Such models can be employed to derive ideal con- 
ditions and permissible limits for the reactors and are also very 
helpful in testing a variety of waste materials and their behavior 
in different kinds of reactors without actually building them. 

A model was developed by Minutillo and co-workers [187] to 
evaluate the composition of product gas and the energy required 
for the gasiﬁcation of RDF (around 70 MW thermal power input 
with waste). The results demonstrated that, for a better plant so- 
lution, the plasma gasiﬁcation eﬃciency is 69.1% (LHV) and LHV 
of  the  produced  syngas  is  about  9  MJ/kg.  The  authors  analyzed 
the  integration  of  the  optimum  plasma  gasiﬁcation  system  with 
a  gas  turbine  combined  cycle  (GTCC)  to  assess  the  feasibility  of 
this technology for the energy recovery from solid wastes and the 
performance of the resulting integrated plasma gasiﬁcation com- 
bined cycle (IPGCC) was investigated. The system eﬃciency (LHV 
~ 31%) was found to be very high as compared to the eﬃciency 
of conventional incineration based technologies (20%). Galeno and 
co-workers [188] also employed RDF as the waste feedstock and 
assessed  the  usage  with  a  net  eﬃciency  of  31%  of  fuel  gas  for 
solid oxide fuel cell. 12.9 MW was termed as the thermal input 
from the RDF. They reported a net electrical eﬃciency as 32.7% af- 
ter subtracting the power consumption by the torch and the air 
separation. Few researchers [ 189 , 190 ] employed a different tech- 
nique where they gasiﬁed the waste via conventional gasiﬁcation 
followed by deployment of plasma for product gas cleaning and 
tar cracking, consequently enhancing the quality of fuel gas to feed 
into the engine. Ray et al. [191] developed a model and calculated 
the net electrical eﬃciency for a commercial scale plant as more 
than 25%. In addition, Lombardi et al. [192] applied the same ap- 
proach for RDF where fuel gas is supplied to internal combustion 
engine and reported a net electrical eﬃciency of 25.3%. This eﬃ- 
ciency was enhanced to 27.4% when paper residues are also added 
into the waste stream. 

In an interesting development, Mountouris et al. [193] devel- 
oped  a  model  called  GasifEq  based  on  ﬁrst  and  second  law  of 
thermodynamics  for  ThP  gasiﬁcation  of  solid  waste  using  recent

thermodynamic data. Thermal plasma treatment process was ana- 
lyzed for the impact of parameters, namely, moisture, amount of 
oxygen  and  gasiﬁcation  temperature  on  the  product  gas  compo- 
sition and on the energy and exergy analysis. The predictive ca- 
pabilities of the model include the formation of soot, selection of 
optimal variables and the need for drying of the feedstock.

Agon and co-authors [194] investigated the single stage plasma 
gasiﬁcation  using  RDF  as  the  feedstock  employing  four  different 
combinations  of  gasifying  agents  (CO 
2 O 
and  O 
2 O).  The  composition  of  the  generated  syngas  was 
compared  vis-à-vis  the  theoretical  composition,  assuming  ther- 
modynamic  equilibrium.  The  performance  of  the  different  cases 
was  evaluated  based  on  the  process  yields  and  energy  eﬃcien- 
cies.  The  temperature  range  of  the  investigation  was  from  1400 
to 1600 K and for all the cases, they reported the generation of 
a medium caloriﬁc value syngas with lower heating values up to 
10.9 MJ/Nm 3 , low levels of tar, high levels of CO and H 
2 and the 
results were in agreement to the equilibrium composition. 

Messerle  and  co-workers  [195]  developed  a  thermodynamic 
model  for  the  plasma  gasiﬁcation  of  MSW  waste  using  air  and 
steam separately as working gases. They deduced that the max- 
imum  yield  of  product  gas  was  achieved  at  1600  K.  For  plasma 
air  gasiﬁcation,  a  concentration  of  84%  product  gas  with  CO  as 
31.7%, H 
2 as 50.7% and speciﬁc heat of combustion as 14267 kJ/kg 
were predicted whereas with steam as the working medium, 94.5% 
product  gas  with  CO  as  33.6%,  H 
2  as  60.9%  and  speciﬁc  heat  of 
combustion  as  19414  kJ/kg  were  calculated.  The  speciﬁc  power 
consumptions were reported as 1.92 kWh/kg and 2.44 kWh/kg for 
air  and  steam,  respectively.  The  calculated  parameters  were  uti- 
lized to design and install a gasiﬁcation plant where experiments 
were conducted. In both the modeling work and experimentation, 
no toxic contaminants were found. In addition, fuel gas with high 
heat content was generated with the production of slag (mainly 
iron  carbide,  calcium  silicate,  silica  and  iron).  Modeling  results 
were in close agreement with the experimentally deduced results. 
In a unique approach, Huang and co-authors [196] developed 
a model based on density functional theory (DFT) to understand 
the reaction routes of model compounds (hemicellulose, xylose, O- 
acetyl  xylose  and  4-O-MeGlcA)  and  to  assess  the  mechanism  of 
biomass pyrolysis in the presence of hydrogen ThP. Several feasible 
reaction pathways were taken into account and the most favorable 
route was proposed after evaluation. This most desirable pathway 
2 as the major products of hemicellu- 
predicts CO, H 
2 H 
lose pyrolysis in ThP with H 
2 as the working gas. It was reported 
that all three cardinal components of biomass, namely, cellulose, 
hemicellulose and lignin play a key role in the formation and dis- 
2  were  generated  by  cellu- 
tribution  of  ﬁnal  products.  CO  and  H 
lose, hemicellulose and lignin whereas CO 
2 was mainly produced 
by hemicellulose and C 
2 coming from hemicellulose. They also 
reported that active H in plasma was found to be vital for dehydro- 
genation reactions in DFT calculations, which were the main source 
of extra hydrogen. This study emphatically reﬂects the usefulness 
of DFT as a tool to understand different mechanisms related to ThP 
assisted waste treatment.

Nowadays,  advanced  3-D  CFD  codes  are  employed  in  combi- 
nation  with  the  chemical  reaction  kinetics  to  develop  advanced 
models  for  the  optimization  of  the  plasma  reactor  design.  The 
phenomenon of the mixing of waste stream with plasma is pre- 
dicted by many modeling studies along with the reactions of the 
volatile  species  inside  the  plasma  reactor  [ 65 , 197 , 198 ].  Colombo 
et al. [199] used arc in a twin torch reactor to develop the model 
whereas  Barthelemy  et  al.  [200]  illustrated  the  twin  torch  reac- 
tor  along  with  the  melting  of  the  waste  in  a  cold  wall  crucible 
with the creation of the skull. On the other hand, investigations 
conducted by Murphy et al. [198] and Hanus et al. [197] coupled 
their ﬂuid dynamics models with reaction kinetics. This technique 

was especially useful in calculating the destruction eﬃciency while 
treating the organic matter. 

The modeling investigations are also carried out to evaluate the 
ThP  vitriﬁcation  process.  These  studies  assessed  the  relation  be- 
tween  the  leaching  behavior  and  the  composition  of  the  waste 
(or  of  the  glassy  slag)  [ 201 , 202 ].  The  modeling  of  oxide  glasses 
or the evaluation of solubility limits of some pollutants in oxide 
glasses  enable  the  prediction  of  phase  separation  or  crystal  for- 
mation, where both have signiﬁcant impact on leaching behavior 
[ 203 , 204 ]. Lapa and co-authors [205] , examined the risks posed by 
leachates from the waste (ﬂy ash) derived glasses and reported a 
minimum ecological risk in using such products, thereby, encour- 
aging the generation of such glasses at commercial level. 

Modeling  studies  are  conducted  out  around  the  globe  to  en- 
hance the energy recovery from the waste coupled with the reduc- 
tion in adverse ecological impact. These objectives can be achieved 
by coupling ThP assisted waste treatment with high energy con- 
version system such as highly eﬃcient fuel cells or combined cycle 
power plants. Galeno and co-workers [188] have carried out an in- 
vestigation with the same approach to assess the performance of 
a combined ThP gasiﬁcation-fuel cell system vis-à-vis energy eﬃ- 
ciency and impact on the environment. They performed the anal- 
ysis  by  integrating  thermochemical  model  of  plasma  gasiﬁcation 
and electrochemical model of solid oxide fuel cell employing As- 
pen Plus. RDF was used as waste material in a plasma arc gasiﬁer 
with air as the plasma gas. Product gas composition and the en- 
ergy balance of the reactor were deduced from a thermochemical 
model whereas stack performance with regard to electrical power 
and eﬃciency were predicted by an electrochemical model. They 
reported a power generation of 4.2 MW per kg of RDF (net power 
~ 87 kW) by the integrated system, with an electrical eﬃciency of 
33%. It is worth noting that this eﬃciency is higher than what is 
obtained with conventional RDF incinerators, which is around 20%. 
In addition, it should be taken into account that even if the power 
output is less than 100 kW, the integrated system is conceived and 
designed for 1 MW so that the constraints on the size on account 
of costs and components availability can be overcome. 

6. Deployment of thermal plasma waste treatment worldwide 
and at industrial level 

The market of ThP assisted waste treatment is gaining momen- 
tum globally. It is on account of various reasons such as the capa- 
bility of plasma to treat any kind of wastes (especially hazardous 
waste), potential to recover energy and other value added prod- 
ucts, high destruction eﬃciency, and environment-friendliness. In 
addition,  the  plasma  system  does  not  require  much  space  as  it 
is compact in design. Consequently, it is also employed on board 
cruisers to treat ship board wastes. Due to the rising popularity, 
the demand for plasma torches and plasma systems are encourag- 
ing the companies to design and manufacture them at industrial 
scale. In the following sections, a brief overview of plasma waste 
conversion at industrial scale along with the present status of ThP 
plants for waste treatment in the USA, the European Union and 
Asia is given. 

It is worth noting that in waste valorization, arc plasmas are 
preferred vis-à-vis other sources of plasmas on account of its rel- 
ative insensitivity to process conditions. On the other hand, tra- 
ditional  MW  discharges  necessitates  the  discharge  to  be  a  part 
of  the  MW  circuit.  Consequently,  it  limits  the  ﬂexibility  of  dis- 
charge parameters (conﬁguration and size of plasma volume) for 
MW plasma [27] . As far as RF plasma is concerned, vigilant op- 
timization of the injection location and of the gas ﬂow rates are 
demanded while feeding waste into the RF torch. In addition, ﬂex- 
ibility in RF plasma with respect to torch power and plasma gas 
ﬂow rates and its heating eﬃciencies are comparatively lower than

The water-cooled walls of the reactor are detached from the inner 
reactor volume by 400 mm thick sandwich ceramic walls in or-

of ceramic insulation is measured at several positions as depicted 

in Fig. 17 . The power loss to the walls at different locations of the 
reactor is analyzed from calorimetric measurements on cooling cir- 
cuits. The waste is fed into the reactor by screw feeder which is 
regulated. The material enters the plasma jet at a location about

ically regulated ﬂow rate. Then, the gas is exhausted by the water 
jet pump into the ﬁlter and cyclone where solid particles are sep- 
arated. A water ejector installed between the ﬁlter and the cyclone 
maintains the reactor slightly under-pressure (of several hundreds 
of Pa). Finally, the gas is combusted in the afterburning chamber. 

6.1. Thermal plasma assisted waste conversion at industrial scale 

Presently,  the  major  fraction  of  the  market  for  high  power 
plasma  torches  is  shared  by  four  companies,  namely,  Westing- 
house,  Europlasma,  Tetronics  and  Phoenix  Solutions  Company. 
Technologies developed and employed by Phoenix, Europlasma and 
Westinghouse are based on DC torches (both transferred and non- 
transferred) using water cooled metal electrodes [ 8 , 127 , 206-210 ]. 
On the other hand, Tetronics employs transferred DC torches with 
two graphite electrodes [ 211 , 212 ]. A schematic of Europlasma reac- 
tor in CENON for ﬂy ash vitriﬁcation is depicted in Fig. 18 . Tetron- 
ics  in  collaboration  with  Advanced  Plasma  Power  is  developing 
and  commercializing  ThP  assisted  waste-to-energy  plants  based 
on transferred DC technique [213] . Westinghouse and Europlasma 
have established plasma waste-to-energy processes based on their 
own technologies. They have also developed market turnkey plants 
via  subsidiaries  such  as  Alter  NRG  for  Westinghouse  and  CHO 
Power for Europlasma [ 214 , 215 ]. Cardinal DC based plasma tech- 
nologies for waste treatment are listed in Table 8 . 

Apart from these developments at industrial scale, some com- 
panies namely, Plasma Arc Technologies, Plasco Energy Group, En- 

ersol  Technologies,  Bellwether  Gasiﬁcation  Technologies,  Startech 
Environmental,  Green  Power  Systems,  Hitachi  Metals,  etc.  have 
adopted  the  designs  and  technologies  of  Europlasma,  Westing- 
house and Phoenix to develop their own facilities whereas others 
(such as Pyrogenesis, PEAT, InEnTec) have adopted to make home- 
made torches [216-224] . These homemade technologies are largely 
based  on  DC  torches,  however,  there  is  a  lack  of  information  in 
the published literature. Many laboratories such as Applied Plasma 
Technologies in USA, PERSEE MINES Paristech in France, Institute 
of Electrophysics and Electric Power in Russia are developing and 
testing other plasma torch technologies such as AC and RF at pilot 
scale [8] . However, these technologies are not yet validated at in- 
dustrial scale for waste treatment. A three-jet plasma reactor (200 
kW) with electric arc plasma generators for the destruction of pes- 
ticides is reﬂected in Fig. 19 whereas Tetronics single-torch trans- 
ferred  arc  reactor  is  shown  in  Fig.  20 .  The  operating  powers  of 
Tetronics  single  torch  reactor  may  vary  widely  from  200  kW  to 
1200 kW for metal cathodes and it may extend up to 2.75 MW 
for high current graphite cathodes [9] . 

A live example of industrial scale ThP assisted waste-to-energy 
is  a  plasma  gasiﬁcation  facility  at  Ottawa,  Canada  developed 
by  Plasco  Energy  Group  to  treat  garbage  from  Trail  Road  land- 
ﬁll  [ 48 , 226 ].  This  facility  can  process  the  waste  at  the  rate  of 
94 tons/d and generates electricity and vitriﬁcates which is used 
as road construction material. The garbage undergoes pretreatment 
(shredding + metal recovery) prior to being fed to the plasma re- 
actor.  The  waste  is  heated  up  to  around  970  K  before  reaching 
the  gasiﬁcation  zone  which  at  1270  K.  The  raw  product  gas  is 
exited from the top of the reactor, cooled with the removal of con- 
taminants such as acidic gases and sulfur. The product gas is fed 
to  an  internal  combustion  engine  and  steam  turbine  to  produce 
electricity. The off-gases are passed through air emission control 
equipment prior to their release to the atmosphere. The bottom 
ash  undergoes  vitriﬁcation  in  the  presence  of  plasma,  recovered 
from the bottom of the reactor and employed as road ﬁller ma- 
terial. The power plant generates ample electricity to sustain itself 
as  well  as  to  sell  to  the  grid.  It  should  be  noted  that  air  emis- 
sions from this plant are considerably lower than the permissible 
limits.  Moreover,  the  economic  evaluation  reﬂects  a  net  positive 
cash ﬂow.

ature is around 400 °C) together with the  limitation of  the ﬂue 
gas temperature in the super-heater below 650 °C, which results 
in lower eﬃciency of electricity production [227] . In modern in- 
cinerators, higher steam parameters are sometimes used (for ex- 
ample, 60 bar and 500 °C or even higher), but this leads to the 
need to use corrosion-resistant materials (such as Inconel 625) to 
protect the exchangers, which also results in increased investment 
costs, which pays off, however, for larger installations [230] . The 
possibility for increasing the electrical eﬃciency is the reheating of 
steam, which is again ﬁnancially feasible only for the large devices 
[231] . 

Plasma gasiﬁcation, as other gasiﬁcation technologies, has the 
possibility to prevent high-temperature corrosion by applying the 
ﬁltration  of  produced  caloriﬁc  gas  at  temperatures  40 0–50 0  °C. 
When the gas is cooled to this temperature, the alkaline corrosive 
chlorine compounds condense on solid particles in the gas, which 
are  ﬁltered  off on  the  ceramic  ﬁlters  at  this  temperature  [232] . 
Additionally, the ﬁlter can be dusted by suitable sorbents to en- 
hance the sorption of corrosive compounds. This can signiﬁcantly 
enhance the resistance of the technology to high-temperature cor- 
rosion. 

6.2. Current scenario of thermal plasma assisted waste conversion 
around the globe 

Plasma assisted waste treatment plants are established world- 
wide.  Most  of  them  are  situated  in  North  America,  Japan  and 
China. In general, the waste fed to these plants are low-moisture in 
nature with almost ﬁxed composition and characteristics which do 
not vary considerably with time, for example, ﬂy ash, bottom ash, 
hazardous waste, medical waste etc. These facilities have capaci- 
ties ranging from 1 t/d–100 t/d with major fraction in the range of 
5–30 t/d. China is leading the Asian nations in plasma waste treat- 
ment. The Chinese Academy of Science employed AC plasma arc 

Fig. 20.  Tetronics single-torch transferred arc reactor (200 kW–2.75 MW) [9] . 

It is worth noting that waste-to-energy units are limited in op- 
eration by the need to prevent signiﬁcant high-temperature acid 
corrosion caused by metal chlorides in ﬂy ash and high concentra- 
tions of hydrogen chloride (HCl) in ﬂue gases [227-229] . The de- 
gree of high-temperature corrosion depends mainly on the surface 
temperature of the metal; thus, to prevent high temperature cor- 
rosion, the surface temperature of evaporators and super-heaters 
must be limited by limiting the evaporating pressure and super- 
heating temperature. In addition, it is necessary to prevent the risk 
of condensation during steam expansion in steam turbines, which 
in turn means an additional limitation for the selected evaporating 
pressure [230] . For these reasons, conservative steam parameters 
are usually chosen (normally the maximum superheating temper-

technology in the early 1990s to process medical waste, hazardous 
waste and ﬂy ash. In the past decade, China has formed lucrative 
policies to attract plasma companies to install plasma waste pro- 
cessing facilities to treat the waste as well as to produce energy 
and value added materials. Municipal solid waste which has the 
highest generation worldwide contains high water fraction and its 
composition varies signiﬁcantly, which necessitates more investi- 
gations to explore an eﬃcient treatment coupled with energy and 
material recovery. Table 9 reﬂects major plasma waste processing 
facilities worldwide along with the feedstock, capacity and year of 
commissioning. 

A number of the plasma gasiﬁcation facilities are for research 
and/or demonstration purposes. The conﬁguration of these instal- 
lations differs in the type of gasiﬁer, the type of thermal plasma 
used (AC or DC, transferred or non-transferred and water-stabilized 
or  gas-stabilized  torches),  in  the  position  and  purpose  of  the 
plasma  unit  (single-  or  two-stage  systems),  the  material  treated 
and the oxidizing medium. 

It should be noted that there exists only a limited number of 
industrial-scale  plasma  waste  treatment  installations  which  have 
been in operation for some years, but the plasma gasiﬁcation de- 
velopment  is  further  increasing  all  over  the  world.  The  publicly 
available  information  about  industrial-scale  commercial  plasma 
gasiﬁcation facilities is often very scarce. A rather high number of 
launched plasma gasiﬁcation projects have failed or have been de- 
commissioned (for example, in Table 9 , plants in Hawthorne, Rich- 
land,  Honululu  and  Utashinai,  Japan,  along  with  the  plant  oper- 

ated by US army), not only due to the ﬁnancial, organizational and 
planning faults, but also due to a number of technological bottle- 
necks which proved to be insurmountable in some cases. Further- 
more, the availability of these plants is lower than for combustion 
(80 0 0 h per year). 

One of the important elements for a project to become success- 
ful is the location of the plasma gasiﬁcation unit. The location is 
crucial in securing a constant availability of waste for the plant. 
The development of a plasma treatment facility is therefore often 
a cooperative effort between local private and/or intercommunal 
(waste) syndicates, the technology providing company and possi- 
bly a company for the downstream use of the gasiﬁcation prod- 
ucts. Similar to the availability of the input, there should also be a 
stable market for the output of the plant, whether it is electricity 
and/or heat, or chemicals. It is clear that a well-deﬁned structure 
and direct ion for the purpose of the plasma gasiﬁcation unit from 
the input to the output is needed. 

Plasma gasiﬁcation reactors need to be able to handle multiple 
tons of waste per hour in order to be ﬁnancially viable. Because 
the technology is relatively new, many of the technology providers 
only have a pilot -scale installation capable of processing a cou- 
ple of tons per day. This means that the capacity of the proposed 
reactor  systems  is  often  up  to  two  orders  of  magnitude  larger 
than  the  proven  demonstration  unit.  One  of  the  consequences 
of  design  ﬂaws  due  to  overambitious  up-scaling  are  cold  spots 
leading  to  incomplete  gasiﬁcation.  Other  technological  problems 
can  include  the  material  for  refractory  lining,  high  temperature

corrosion, and particulates build-up and clogging of piping and the 
afterburner. 

Adding these challenges to the technological barriers inherent 
to  plasma  torches  (such  as  torch  eﬃciencies  and  electrode  life- 
time), it becomes evident that a plasma gasiﬁcation project needs 
to be very well engineered in order to beneﬁt from the potential 
of the technology. 

Thermal  plasma  is  employed  around  the  globe  for  metal  re- 
covery from metal containing wastes such as red mud, electronic 
wastes, waste circuit boards, galvanic sludge, aluminum dross, in- 
cinerated ash etc. Several nations (USA, Canada, China, Japan, Aus- 
tralia, Brazil, India, etc.) have conducted studies based on thermal 
plasma technologies to  treat these wastes and reclaim the valu- 
able metals. Most of the investigations have used DC transferred 
and non-transferred arc plasma systems. However, some have em- 
ployed RF based systems as well. A vast number of assessments 
have used Ar, N 
2 and air as the working gas while few have used 
H 
2 or combinations of them. Valuable metals such as Ag, Au, Cu, 
Pt, Fe, Ni, Co, Al, Zn, etc. were successfully and eﬃciently recov- 
ered from the wastes and recycled. Table 10 shows various inves- 
tigations around the globe to process the metal containing wastes 
with reclamation of valuable metals. 

The studies related to the recovery of metals from metal con- 
taining wastes are still at infancy stage and there is a lack of data 
to establish large-scale facilities. In addition, there is still a huge 
potential to improve the process eﬃciency. As far as waste pro- 
cessing is concerned, the world is moving ahead with successful 
operation of plasma waste treatment plants on account of its high 
destruction  eﬃciency  and  eco-friendly  nature.  Moreover,  plasma 
plants have reduced a considerable amount of pressure from the 
already overﬂowing landﬁlls. It is worth noting that plasma treat- 
ment plant can be more economical than a conventional incinera- 
tion plant provided energy and value added products are reclaimed 
as discussed in Section 7.2 . 

7. Impact on environment and economics 

The plasma assisted waste conversion is found to have no ad- 
verse  inﬂuence  on  the  environment.  The  off gases  are  well  be- 

low the permissible limits and the leaching of toxic materials from 
the glassy slag is within the regulations [10] . As a matter of fact, 
the plasma waste treatment reduces the already existing load on 
the environment by safely treating the hazardous waste and other 
wastes which are sent to the overﬂowing landﬁlls. Although the 
costs associated with installation and operation of plasma plants 
are  very  high  on  account  of  expensive  equipment,  demand  for 
large amounts of electricity and necessity of highly skilled techni- 
cians and labor, the successful operations of various plants around 
the globe reﬂects positive economics [235-237] . The tipping fees 
coupled with value added by-products and end products improves 
the  economics  of  plasma  treatment.  The  ﬂipside  is  the  usage  of 
the most useful form of energy, i.e. electrical energy. However, this 
limitation  can  be  countered  by  making  the  plant  self-sustaining 
w.r.t energy and reducing the operational costs by recycling and 
utilizing the energy content of the materials [238] . 

7.1. Effect on environment 

As  seen  in  the  previous  sections,  the  product  gas  formed  in 
the  plasma  process  is  cleaner  in  nature  on  account  of  the  very 
high  temperatures  compared  with  the  conventional  gasiﬁcation 
processes and there is no need for product gas cleaning. The ﬁnal 
emissions to the atmosphere is a function of the extent of clean- 
ing of the fuel gas with an exception of NO x which is not formed 
during gasiﬁcation, though NO x can be formed during the combus- 
tion of the producer gas. Another advantageous feature of thermal 
assisted reductive waste treatment processes is the prevention of 
the formation of dioxins and furans. They are avoided on account 
of elevated temperatures during plasma treatment, however, they 
can reappear during the cooling of product gas. Rapid cooling or 
quenching can inhibit the reappearance of dioxins and furans at 
the cost of heat loss. Emissions to water comes up with the fuel 
gas cleaning process and will lead to the increase of salts in the 
water which necessitates processing to generate a solid residue or 
disposal to sewer. The vitriﬁed ash has low leachability which is 
within the permissible limits and can be used in a variety of ap- 
plications including road construction, building materials, ceram- 
ics, etc. Table 11 lists the major pollutants likely to be generated

during the process along with their impact and how to get rid of 
them [ 235 , 239-247 ]. 

As  suﬃciently  high temperatures  and homogeneous  tempera- 
ture distribution can be easily maintained in the whole plasma re- 
actor volume, the production of complex hydrocarbons, tars and 
other molecules is substantially reduced in comparison with incin- 
eration. 

Due  to  a  lack  of  publicly  available  data  from  commercial  in- 
stallations, an example of tar analysis of syngas performed after 
plasma gasiﬁcation of RDF in the research reactor at the Institute 
of Plasma Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague is 
given in Table 12 [ 91 , 194 ]. The solid phase adsorption/extraction 
(SPA/SPE) method was used for tar sampling. Tar vapours were ad- 
sorbed on to aminopropyl-bonded silica (Discovery DSC-NH2). The 

SPE  tubes  were  preconditioned  with  2.5  ml  of  dichloromethane 
(DCM). Three syngas samples of 60 0–90 0 ml were taken from the 
gas  ﬂow  over  the  course  of  the  experiment.  Analytes  were  des- 
orbed  by  DCM  and  the  fractions  were  analyzed  by  GC-FID.  The 
total  tar  content  of  these  samples  varied  between  132  and  543 
mg/Nm 3 . From Table 12 , it can be seen that the condensed tertiary 
products (such as naphthalene, acenaphthylene and phenanthrene) 
were most abundant in the syngas samples, while the concentra- 
tion of the benzene–toluene–xylene (BTX) fraction remained very 
low. This is in line with the chemical components generally found 
with high-temperature steam gasiﬁcation. 

The  measured  tar  content  in  the  syngas  produced  from  RDF 
plasma gasiﬁcation was higher than the tar content in the syngas 
from biomass plasma gasiﬁcation (10 mg/Nm 3 ) in the same reactor 
[115] , most likely because of the heterogeneous nature of the RDF 
and the coarser particle size. On the other hand, the tar level was 
lower than in the syngas obtained from conventional RDF gasiﬁca- 
tion, which is typically in the range of 1–100 g/Nm 3 , depending on 
the type of gasiﬁer. Nevertheless, a cleaning step would be neces- 
sary prior to downstream application of the syngas produced from 
RDF plasma gasiﬁcation to a gas engine, gas turbine or fuel cell, 
which have tar tolerance levels of about 50, 5 and 1 mg/Nm 3 , re- 
spectively. 

In an interesting and valuable study conducted by Herva and 
Roca [248] , the impact of different MSW treatment pathways was 
assessed based on ecological footprint and multi-criteria analysis. 
They employed numerous environmental and sustainability indica- 
tors in their investigation. In addition, they highlighted integrative 
frameworks to obtain a more all-inclusive evaluation. Their objec- 
tives included identiﬁcation of the most advantageous waste treat-

ment pathway from an environmental viewpoint and, comparison 
of the results obtained from two different methods (1. ecological 
footprint as single composite indicator and 2. multi-criteria anal- 
ysis which integrates ecological footprint with other material ﬂow 
indicators). They compared four different routes for MSW process- 
ing, namely, thermal plasma gasiﬁcation, incineration with energy 
recovery, biological processing of organic fraction with energy re- 
covery from RDF, and landﬁlling. The acquired results in both the 
cases proved that thermal plasma gasiﬁcation is the best method 
to treat the wastes followed by biological treatment, incineration 
and landﬁlling (as the worst route). It should be noted that the 
ranking obtained was in agreement with the general hierarchy rec- 
ommended by the governmental agencies which prefer waste pro- 
cessing technologies with energy and/or materials recovery. 

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an inﬂuential tool that assists in 
the quantiﬁcation of environmental impacts caused throughout the 
waste treatment process, from waste reception to its treatment and 
ﬁnally to disposal of the residues. Ramos and co-workers [249] in 
an important study conducted LCA of 2-stage plasma gasiﬁcation 
of MSW which comprised of MSW gasiﬁcation (ﬁrst stage), plasma 
treatment of tars and gases (second stage), syngas processing and 
landﬁll of the inert products. A comparison to a typical inciner- 
ation plant was also carried out regarding environmental perfor- 
mance and eﬃciency. They reported plasma gasiﬁcation pathway 
to offer savings up to 260 tons of energy resources, 130 tons of 
material resources and similar amount of emissions to fresh water 
as main ﬂows whereas incineration achieved an avoided burden of 
more than 20 tons of deposited goods, albeit with an environmen- 
tal threat of 5 tons of material resources and 4 tons of emissions to 
air. In addition, Global Warming Potential (GWP) of -31 kg CO 
2 eq., 
Eutrophication Potential (EP) of -1.55 × 10 3 kg PO 
4 3 − eq., Acidiﬁ- 
cation Potential (AP) of -39.7 × 10 −2 kg SO 
2 eq. and Photochemi- 
cal Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) of -2.23 × 10 −2 kg ethene eq. 
were found emphatically reﬂecting environmental beneﬁts vis-à- 
vis savings of natural resources coupled with decreased pollutant 
emissions. 

Tagliaferri et al. [250] in an interesting work, evaluated the en- 
vironmental eﬃcacy of traditional and advanced MSW processing 
pathways (anaerobic digestion, incineration and dual stage plasma 
gasiﬁcation) to generate Bio-SNG. Two different approaches were 
adopted, namely, (1) best waste treatment pathway vis-à-vis envi- 
4 generation, with functional units 
ronment and (2) renewable CH 
as 1 kg of MSW and 1 MJ of CH 
4  generated, respectively for the 
two  approaches.  As  far  as  GWP  was  concerned,  thermal  plasma 
technology did not emerge as a favorable alternative as it was in 
its infancy state and also as a result of the current UK energy mix. 
The authors also examined the projection of GWP for the processes 
studied till 2035 accounting for future energy scenarios and found 
that when the problem of renewable energy generation was solved 
(functional unit 1 MJ of CH 
4 ), the current GWP reﬂected that the 
best pathway for MSW processing would be the two stage thermal 
plasma gasiﬁcation as a result of a higher eﬃciency in CH 
4 gener- 
ation. 

Evangelisti and co-workers [251] compared the environmental 
effects of three different advanced MSW processing routes (gasiﬁ- 
cation followed by plasma gas cleaning, fast pyrolysis followed by 
combustion, and gasiﬁcation with syngas combustion) with tradi- 
tional technologies (landﬁll with electricity generation and inciner- 
ation followed by electricity production). They demonstrated that 
the  environmental  eﬃcacy  of  two  stage  plasma  gasiﬁcation  was 
considerably higher than the conventional waste treatment path- 
ways and slightly better than an advanced incineration plant (at 
Lincolnshire in the UK). It was on account of higher net electri- 
cal  eﬃciency  of  dual  plasma  gasiﬁcation.  The  ﬁnest  eﬃcacy  for 
GWP was reﬂected by plasma process with GWP as 0.18 kg CO 
2 
eq./kWh which was only 30% of the Sheﬃeld incineration plant, 

40% of the impact of the air blown gasiﬁer system and 45% of the 
fast pyrolyzer with gasiﬁer. For the EP impact category, the best 
performance with 1.4 × 10 −4 kg phosphate eq. was again shown by 
the plasma pathway. However, the incineration process reﬂected a 
lower POCP impact vis-à-vis the plasma process with -1.5 × 10 −4 
kg ethane eq. for incineration and -8.6 × 10 −5 kg ethane eq. per 
kg of waste for dual plasma process. It was on account of higher 
amounts of secondary aggregates which can be reclaimed from in- 
cineration plant. These conclusions emphatically reveal the poten- 
tial of plasma pathway to emerge as an environment friendly tech- 
nology for MSW processing as compared to other traditional and 
advanced technologies. 

7.2. Economics 

Wastes, in principle, have a negative value and therefore, the 
technique  or  process  which  adds  value  to  it  should  ideally  de- 
crease  the  cost  of  treatment  /  disposal.  The  cost  of  waste  dis- 
posal is dependent on governmental framework and consequently, 
it  is  more  for  hazardous  wastes  than  for  non-hazardous  wastes. 
The cardinal advantages with thermal plasma assisted waste trans- 
formation  processes  vis-à-vis  other  processes  are  comparatively 
reduced  exit  gases,  higher  volume  reduction,  installations  with 
smaller footprints, faster start-up and shut-down times and, lower 
costs for a speciﬁed throughput. Strict emission based standards 
make  combustion  based  waste  treatment  costly  whereas  storage 
costs  and  lack  of  space  makes  landﬁlling  diﬃcult  or  impossible. 
In these cases, (especially in the cases of hazardous wastes such 
as low level radioactive wastes), plasma processing becomes more 
economical and thus, attractive. Although smaller mobile plasma 
waste processing plants sound attractive on account of zero waste 
transportation cost and lower investment cost, in reality they are 
costly  due  to  enhanced  labor  costs  [9] .  Mustoe  and  co-authors 
[252] examined diverse operating cost elements that are accounted 
in the process economics per ton of waste, for a plasma vitriﬁca- 
tion plant.  They assumed 24  h operation for 300 days per year. 
They constituted four operating groups with three persons in each 
group. The total lifetime of the installation was taken as 8 years 
with linear depreciation with electricity cost as USD 0.06 per kWh. 
They deduced that electricity costs can be reduced to a signiﬁcant 
extent  by  employing  the  exhaust  gases  for  power  generation.  In 
addition, they revealed that operating with a throughput of more 
than 100 t/d was advantageous. 

Heberlein and co-authors [9] have provided an interesting anal- 
ysis  of  proﬁtability  of  destruction  of  ozone  depleting  substances 
(OD) by thermal plasma as compared to incineration. In general 
ODs  are  found  in  concentrated  form  and  therefore,  thermal  en- 
ergy is not used in heating non-hazardous fractions. Moreover, ODs 
have a high value for halogen-to-carbon ratio and consequently, a 
major cost associated to ODs destruction is due to neutralizing the 
released acid gases. Although this is the same for all the pathways, 
the cost enhances with high gas ﬂow rates. Plasma treatment with 
lower gas ﬂow rates is therefore economical. Furthermore, incin- 
eration  is  impaired  by  high  ﬂuorine  concentrations  (HF)  in  ODs 
which necessitates alterations in the scrubbing systems. Even then, 
the ﬂuorine content in the feed should be restricted to 1%. Nothing 
of this sort is required in plasma treatment. 

Researchers  [10]  have  examined  the  process  economics  for  a 
MSW plasma gasiﬁcation plant with a treatment capacity of 600 
tons/d. The total investment was USD 99.3 million whereas the ex- 
tracted gains were on account of electricity, glassy slag, foam glass 
and subsidy. They assumed the selling price of power as 9.7 cents 
per kWh and they sold around 350 kWh/t. Therefore, the income 
was around USD 6.67 million per year. The glassy slag and foam 
slag were generated at the rates of 90 0 0 0 tons per year and 10 0 0 0 
tons per year respectively. The former was sold at a rate of USD 

V.S. Sikarwar, M. Hrabovský and G. Van Oost et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 81 (2020) 100873

105/t whereas latter was sold at USD 1080.8/t making the earnings 
as USD 9.45 million and USD 10.81 million per year respectively. It 
was assumed that the plant got a subsidy of USD 9.26/t making it 
USD 1.85 million. Thus, the total revenue generation for a year was 
around  USD  28.87  million.  On  the  other  hand,  the  income  from 
conventional incineration plants does not exceed USD 9.5 million. 
According to this study, the economic returns are almost 3 times 
vis-à-vis traditional incineration units. 

E.N. Kalogirou [253] in his book titled “Waste-to-Energy Tech- 
nologies  and  Global  Applications” discussed  a  waste-to-energy 
tool/business  model.  It  pre-calculates  and  predesigns  different 
types of waste-to-energy plants worldwide, taking into consider- 
ation multi-parameters such as the composition and caloriﬁc value 
of  the  input  waste,  local  climate  conditions,  the  gross  domestic 
product (GDP), social/ﬁnancial conditions, and so on. An indicative 
range of initial capital expense (CAPEX) for the construction of a 
WTE plant is 450–900 USD per ton of annual capacity (tpa). The 
annual operational costs (OPEX) are inﬂuenced by various factors. 
A safe range to be used in case of lack of suﬃcient data, is from 2% 
to 3% of the facility’s capital investment. As an example of thermal 
plasma WTE, an installation in South Korea for 10 tpd (3300 tpa) 
MSW is mentioned with a CAPEX of 3 million USD. 

From  the  scarce  published  literature  and  private  communica- 
tions, some more examples of ThP WTE plants are (i) China [10] : 
MSW plasma gasiﬁcation plant with a treatment capacity of 600 
tons/d.  The  estimate  of  CAPEX  was  about  USD  99.3  million,  (ii) 
Saudi Arabia [254] : 100 tpd of mixed solid waste was produced 
during  the  pilgrimage  season  in  Makkah.  The  ﬁrst  estimate  of 
CAPEX was around 37 million USD, and (iii) Morocco (private com- 
munication): 250 0 0 0 tpa of MSW with an estimate of CAPEX as 
100 million USD. These examples indicate that the CAPEX for ThP 
WTE plants is within the range mentioned by Kalogirou [253] , but 
at the higher side, as expected. 

There are some other economic indicators such as Net Present 
Value  (NPV)  and  Internal  Rate  of  Return  (IRR)  which  reﬂect  the 
proﬁtability and return characteristics and serve as assets to com- 
pare different technologies vis-à-vis economics. NPV is the present 
worth of an investment and basically represents the difference be- 
tween the present value of the expenses and the present value of 
the revenues, recognizing the money update. On the other hand, 
IRR represents the interest rate that equals the present value of 
the future incomes to the initial cost [255] . Therefore, IRR deﬁnes 
the interest rate that causes the NPV to be zero. It denotes a prof- 
itability measure deﬁning the maximum rate of return for viability. 
Positive NPV indicates that the investment is economically feasi- 
ble, negative NPV designates an unfeasible investment and neutral 
NPV shows a potentially feasible investment with a return equal to 
the IRR. An interesting account of NPV/IRR evaluation for a plasma 
waste treatment plant can be found elsewhere [255] . 

In  order  to  completely  assess  the  economics  of  a  thermal 
plasma based waste treatment plant, cost of the plant including 
off gases  treatment,  cost  of  required  energy,  ﬂexibility  vis-à-vis 
waste  composition,  economic  incentives  from  government,  regu- 
lations  associated  with  handling  /  processing  /  recycling  of  haz- 
ardous wastes must be taken into account. Lack of published liter- 
ature disable to conclude ﬁrmly about how a more eﬃcient trans- 
formation of heating value of waste to fuel gas or electricity would 
impact  the  economics  of  the  plasma  assisted  processes  vis-à-vis 
conventional incineration processes. 

8. Conclusions and perspectives 

A  sense  of  concern  is  required  among  different  governments 
on account of the inﬂuence of traditional waste processing path- 
ways such as landﬁlling, incineration, etc. on climate change be- 
cause of greenhouse gas emissions and due to their contribution 

to air, water, land and soil pollution. This calls for sustainable al- 
ternatives which have the potential for climate change mitigation 
with minimum (or negative) greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, 
these pathways should be economical and should not have an ad- 
verse inﬂuence on the ecology or the society. Thermal plasma as- 
sisted waste processing technologies have the potential to include 
all these characteristics. However, lack of understanding of the pro- 
cess coupled with high installation and operation costs, and the 
utilization of the most useful form of energy (electricity) as input, 
are  the  key  obstacles  in  the  deployment  of  plasma  processes  to 
a greater extent. These issues should not be allowed to divert us 
from taking the essential steps to exploit the major potential ad- 
vantages of plasma processes and encouraging them more widely. 
A  deep  understanding  and  knowledge  of  the  plasma  assisted 
waste treatment processes along with the alternative approaches 
are  required  for  optimization  and  advancements  in  an  economi- 
cal manner. The in-depth survey throughout this paper has pro- 
vided evidence about various kinds of wastes and their applicabil- 
ity to the plasma process. The impacts of different plasma torches 
and reactor designs on the properties and yields of the byprod- 
ucts  and  co-products  have  been  discussed  with  the  aim  to  help 
the  optimization  of  future  research  and  the  process  as  a  whole. 
Plasma gasiﬁcation / pyrolysis coupled with vitriﬁcation are inter- 
esting and potentially economical ways to optimize wastes utiliza- 
tion. More novel technologies, such as plasma assisted metal re- 
covery and puriﬁcation from metal containing wastes could be the 
inﬂuential pathways to extract the maximum possible value from 
the wastes and it also demonstrate the developments and opportu- 
nities in plasma processes. The progress in modelling is paving the 
way for future expansion in discovering and designing new plasma 
torches and new processes, to make the process cost-effective and 
operate with a higher eﬃciency. Although plasma processes have 
some ﬂip sides such as the utilization of electricity as input and 
high installation costs, they can be minimized through appropriate 
technological (for e.g. using renewable and off-peak electricity) and 
policy implementations (for e.g. subsidies). In addition, the current 
scenario of plasma waste processing facilities around the globe has 
been explored. This paper presents a positive case for plasma as- 
sisted processes for waste treatment coupled with material and en- 
ergy recovery as a promising, viable and economically beneﬁcial 
technology. It has been shown that the process is not limited to 
a particular feedstock and speciﬁc product, but is ﬂexible towards 
the treatment of wide variety of wastes that may be toxic or con- 
taminated, for the generation of diversiﬁed usable products. 

The market of ThP assisted waste treatment is gaining momen- 
tum globally. It is on account of various reasons such as the capa- 
bility of plasma to treat any kind of wastes (especially hazardous 
waste), potential to recover energy and other value added prod- 
ucts, high destruction eﬃciency, and environment-friendliness. In 
addition, the plasma system does not require much space as it is 
compact in design. 

The challenges should be taken as an encouragement to design 
and develop advanced plasma based technologies for waste pro- 
cessing  with  the  recovery  of  energy  and  value  added  materials. 
More investigations on metal reclamation and processing of high 
moisture  content  wastes  are  required  to  understand  them  com- 
pletely and to ensure their holistic and sustainable implementa- 
tion. As plasma process is a clean pathway to synthesize impor- 
tant  chemicals  and  other  value  added  products  using  renewable 
electricity, more in-depth studies are needed in this area. In ad- 
dition, plasma technology can play a vital role in P2X concept due 
to its regulation possibilities (e.g. from 10 to 100% of power in- 
put). The scale-up of the existing plants should be explored, em- 
ploying new technologies with favourable governmental policies. In 
this regard, a collective effort by scientists and engineers, environ- 
mentalists and policy-makers is very crucial to ensure the effective

incorporation of plasma waste processing in our society for a sus- 
tainable and eco-friendly future. 

Some examples of perspective applications are: 

• Nowadays sewage sludge utilization is one of the main issues of 
waste treatment industry. High-temperature decomposition of 
sludge (for example by using a plasma torch) enables safe waste 
recovery and excludes contamination by heavy metals of the re- 
sulting P-rich product. The plasma technology has the beneﬁt 
that besides of a P-rich product, which can be practically free 
of heavy metals, also offers very interesting co-products. 

• The produced tar-free synthesis gas (syngas) can be used in the 
next  cycle  of  the  waste  treatment  as  a  fuel  for  a  gas  engine 
or gas turbine to produce (peak) electrical and thermal energy 
in a combined mode (CHP). The process can be also driven to 
produce  less  CO  and  purer  solid  carbon  with  gas  rich  in  H 
2 
(plasma pyrolysis). The high-temperature plasma treatment al- 
lows reaching high degree of product conversion and safety due 
to an extremely high process enthalpy. All those advantages can 
be combined into new advanced valorization strategy. 

• A plausible industrial installation could be the sustainable de- 
centralized production of hydrogen from MSW, sludge or agri- 
cultural waste. The production of pure hydrogen from the rel- 
atively pure syngas is a well-established, eﬃcient and simple 
procedure. 

• More than 75% of the methanol volume produced comes from 
natural gas which is steam reformed into syngas. The plasma 
gasiﬁcation technology can be an economical and environmen- 
tally  friendly  alternative  for  producing  syngas  which  in  turn 
can  be  used  to  produce  methanol,  where  the  syngas  is  pro- 
duced from biomass (and also from waste) with CO 
2  being a 
co-reactant. The main use of methanol is as a raw material for 
making other chemicals. A second limited use of methanol is 
to provide internal combustion engines with (sustainable) fuel. 
Therefore, plasma technology can be regarded as a carbon cap- 
ture and utilization (CCU) route. 

• Another possible application is the use of the syngas for the 
production  of  electricity  via  steam  and  gas  turbines.  There 
are  already  several  large  integrated  gasiﬁcation  cycle  cycles 
(IGCC) that produce electricity from lignite as raw material. The 
plasma  gasiﬁcation  reactor  can  provide  some  additional  pro- 
ducer gas for the already installed combined cycle.
