Biomass is available from many sources or can be mass-produced. Moreover, biomass has a high energy-
generation potential, produces less toxic emissions than some other fuels, is mostly carbon neutrality,
and burns easily. Biomass has been widely utilized as a raw material in thermal chemical conversion,
replacing coal and oil, including power generation. Biomass firing and co-firing in pulverized coal boilers,
fluidized bed boilers, and grate furnaces or stokerfed boilers have been developed around the world because
of the worsening environmental problems and developing energy crisis. However, many issues hinder
the efficient and clean utilization of biomass in energy applications. They include preparation, firing and
co-firing, and ash-related issues during and after combustion. In particular, ash-related issues, includ-
ing alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), agglomeration, corrosion, and
ash utilization, are among the most challenging problems. The current review provides a summary of
knowledge and research developments concerning these ash-related issues. It also gives an in-depth anal-
ysis and discussion on the formation mechanisms, urgent requirements, and potential countermeasures
including the use of additives, co-firing, leaching, and alloying.

Alkali species, particularly alkali chlorides and sulfates, cause alkali-induced slagging during biomass
combustion. Thus, the mechanisms of generation, transformation, and sequestration of alkali species and
the formation and growth of alkali-induced slagging, formed as an alternating overlapping multi-
layered structure, are discussed in detail. For silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), the evolutions
of chemical composition of both the elements and minerals in the ash during combustion and existing
problems in testing are overviewed. Pseudo-4D phase diagrams of (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-
MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3 are proposed as effective tools to predict ash fusion characteristics and the properties
of melt-induced slagging. Concerning agglomeration that typically occurs in fluidized bed furnaces, melt-
induced and coating-induced agglomeration and coating-forming mechanisms are highlighted. Concerning
corrosion, seven corrosion mechanisms associated with Cl2, gaseous, solid/deposited, and molten alkali
chlorides, molten alkali sulfates and carbonates, and the sulfation/silication of alkali chlorides are com-
prehensively reviewed. The effects of alloying, salt state (solid, molten, or gaseous), combustion atmosphere,
and temperature are also discussed systematically. For ash utilization, potential approaches to the use
of fly ash, bottom ash, and biomass/coal co-fired ash as construction and agricultural materials are explored.
Several criteria or evaluation indexes are introduced for alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration,
and chemical equilibrium calculation and multicomponent phase diagrams of silicate melt-induced slagging
and agglomeration. Meanwhile, remedies, including the use of additives, co-firing, leaching, alloying, and
the establishment of regulations, are discussed.

It is suggested that considerable attention should be focused on an understanding of the kinetics of
alkali chemistry, which is essential for the transformation and sequestration of alkali species. A combi-
nation of heterogeneous chemical kinetics and multiphase equilibrium modeling is critical to estimating
the speciation, saturation levels, and the presence of melt of the ash-forming matter. Further practical

evaluation and improvement of the existing criterion numbers of alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration
should be improved. The pseudo-4D phase diagrams of (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-SiO2-
Al2O3 should be constructed from the data derived from real biomass ashes rather than those of simulated
ashes in order to provide the capability to predict the properties of silicate melt-induced slagging. Apart
from Cr, research should be conducted to understand the effects of Si, Al, and Co, which exhibit high
corrosion resistance, and heavy metals such as Zn and Pb, which may form low-melting chlorides that
accelerate corrosion. Regulations, cooperation among biomass-fired power plants and other industries,
potential technical research, and logistics should be strengthened to enable the extensive utilization of
biomass ash. Finally, alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging, agglomeration, and corrosion
occur concurrently, and thus, these issues should be investigated jointly rather than separately.

1. Introduction

Biomass as a sufficiently “green” renewable and CO2-neutral
energy source has attracted worldwide attention because of the
worsening energy crisis and environmental issues. By switching from
coal and natural gas to biomass, the net CO2 emission per unit heating
value can be reduced by 93% and 84%, respectively [1]. In 2004, the
total global biomass power installed capacity reached 39 GW, and
the annual energy generation achieved was approximately 200 billion
kWh [2]. Data show that biomass power installed capacity in the
USA has reached 10 GW [3], and a similar increase to 30 GW by 2020
is expected in China [4].

Biomass fuel is defined as any solid organic material that can be
burned and used as a source of fuel [5]. Biomass can be classified
into four major categories, according to its source, i.e., woody, ag-
ricultural, waste, and excrement. Among these, woody biomass is
the largest biomass energy source; it covers forest residues (e.g., dead
trees, branches and tree stumps, leaves), landscaping residues (yard
clippings), industrial wood residue (wood chips, sawdust, etc.), waste
wood residues, and so on. Agricultural biomass contains straw and
other harvesting residues from agriculture, energy plants from ag-
riculture, residues from the food industry, and grass. Waste includes
municipal solid waste, domestic wastewater, commercial waste, and
construction waste. Excrement includes farm slurry/excrement and
organic waste from households and industry.

Despite its well-known advantages such as high-energy-
generation potential and carbon dioxide neutrality that encourage
the rapid development of biomass-fired power plants, biomass com-
bustion remains challenging for several reasons. These include
problems in the pre-preparation of biofuel (referring to collection,
transportation, upgrading by leaching, torrefaction and pelleting,
and milling), firing and co-firing technologies (encompassing direct

firing, injection co-firing, co-milling co-firing, pre-gasification co-
firing, and parallel co-firing in pulverized coal (PC) boilers, FB boilers,
and grate or fixed bed furnaces), and ash-related issues that occur
both during and after combustion [5]. As shown in Fig. 1, ash-
related problems, including alkali-induced slagging [6,7,11–14],
silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion) [3,7,9,14–16], agglom-
eration [8,14,17–20], corrosion [10,14,21–24], and ash utilization
[25,26], are the most intractable issues. Whether in FBs or grate
furnaces, high concentrations of Cl and alkali metals (K and Na) in
biomass result in the rapid buildup of unmanageable deposits on
the fired surfaces, particularly alkali-induced slagging on the su-
perheater [3,6,7,9,11–16,27,28] and silicate melt-induced slagging
on the water wall [3], which inhibit heat transfer and reduce boiler
efficiency [26,29]. Furthermore, accumulated ash with a high Cl
concentration on tube surfaces may lead to corrosion underneath
the deposit [14,22,28]. Meanwhile, agglomeration, which origi-
nates from fused or partly fused ash, is another major challenge in
biomass combustion in FBs and frequently results in defluidization
and unscheduled shutdown of
the entire power plant
[8,14,17–20,28,30]. However, the corresponding mechanisms and
countermeasures for alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced
slagging (ash fusion), agglomeration, and corrosion, and the
utilization/disposal principles of ash residues from biomass-fired
power plants remain unclear [28]. Unlike coal, biomass has various
sources. For example, woody biomass is low in Si and K, yet high
in Ca. Agricultural residues are high in Si and K, yet low in Ca. In
contrast, animal residues are high in both P and Ca [28,31]. Fur-
thermore, even for a specific biomass, different planting
environments [12,32], harvest seasons [20,33], and different parts
of the biomass [34,35] can produce distinct ash contents and com-
positions. This results in unpredictable and highly variable ash-
related issues.

KCl and K2SO4 are the dominant alkali-containing substances that
influence biomass ash-related issues [36]. While K2SO4 is a domi-
nant species that nucleates when the gas temperature is reduced
[37], KCl condenses on the K2SO4 nuclei at a low temperature [38].
Similar results were reported by Reichelt et al. [39] and Nutalapati
et al. [31] from both experimental data and FACTSAGE simulation
calculations. They found that K2SO4 mainly accumulates on high-
temperature heating surfaces, whereas KCl accumulates on low-
temperature heating surfaces. In addition, Li et al. [3] and authors
[6] have indicated that both K2Ca(SO4)2 and K3Na(SO4)2 play a sig-
nificant role in slagging.

A number of experimental studies concerning additives [40,41],
co-firing [42,43], chemical pretreatment [44,45], and alloying [46,47],
all of which change the generation and transformation processes
of alkali chlorides and sulfates, have been conducted to solve ash-
related problems. However, these are all possible targets because
of the variability in biomass species, plant environment, combus-
tion temperature, and atmosphere [40,48–51]; remedial methods
that may be effective under one set of conditions may prove inef-
fective for other types of fuel and under different conditions. As an
alternative, to solve these troublesome ash-related problems fun-
damentally and provide useful guidelines for the selection of co-
firing fuels, additives, and biomass fired in utility boilers, several
researchers began to focus on criterion numbers or evaluation
indexes such as the alkali index (K2O + Na2O) kg·GJ−1 [52],
(Na + K+2Mg+2Ca)/S ratio [53], (K + Na)/(Ca + Mg) ratio [54], and S/Cl
ratio [55].

Aside from the experimental research on additives, co-firing,
chemical pretreatment, and evaluation indexes, several research-
ers studied ash transformation by means of thermal-balance
calculation software such as FACTSAGE, which is based on Gibbs free
energy minimization [31,56–58]. However, Bostrom et al. [48]
pointed out that the ash transformation reactions may be influ-
enced by temperature, residence time, air supply, flue gas velocity,
and other factors. Because in the flame of a powder burner or PC
furnace, short residence times limit the interactions and encoun-
ters between the ash and gases; the system is far from being at
equilibrium. The main challenges are not only to predict local com-
positions and implement relevant transport equations for particles,
but also to obtain a reasonable estimate of the speciation of inor-
ganic matter, i.e., ash-forming elements, in each volume cell rather
than in the pseudo-final state.

Although several studies including experiments, evaluation index
analysis, and thermal-balance calculation/simulations have been con-
ducted, ash-related problems remain unresolved, and knowledge
about their causes is fragmentary. Therefore, the focus of this study
is to review the progress of research and to reveal the formation

mechanisms, urgent requirements, and potential countermea-
sures to solve the abovementioned ash-related problems. The paper
consists of three main parts, divided according to the amount of re-
search attention they have received and their importance in current
practical operations in biomass power generation:

Part I presents the main ash-related issues, including alkali-
induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), and
agglomeration, as well as countermeasures related to the use of
additives, co-firing, and leaching.
Part II presents a discussion of the additional ash-related issues,
i.e., corrosion, including various corrosion mechanisms and coun-
termeasures or influence factors.
Part III focuses on biomass ash utilization as construction ma-
terials and agricultural soil ameliorants. Limitations and
counterplans are also discussed.

2. Part I. Main ash-related issues during combustion: alkali-
induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion),
agglomeration, and customized countermeasures including
additives, co-firing, and leaching

A schematic of ash formation and transformation mechanism
in biomass combustion is shown in Fig. 2. Similar to pulverized
coal combustion [59], during the combustion of biomass particles
and the formation of char particles, volatile organo-metallic com-
pounds (containing Cr, V, etc.) are first released followed by
devolatilization; then, partial alkali and alkali-earth elements
(e.g., K, Na, and Ca) and volatile trace elements (eg., Hg, As, and
Se) diffused out of the char. As the gas temperature decreases, the
volatile components nucleate and condense to form submicron-
sized particle. Also, some volatile material condenses on residual
fly ash. The high concentrations of K and Na (especially K) through
nucleation, condensation, and reactions result in a variety of
severe ash-related problems such as alkali-induced slagging, sili-
cate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), and agglomeration (Figs. 1
and 3).

Fig. 3 shows the formation mechanisms of alkali-induced slagging,
silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), agglomeration, and fly
ash. KCl is considered the most stable gas-phase alkali-metal-
containing substance in the entire combustion process and the
dominant substance that influences biomass slagging [6,36,60].
During the process of combustion, alkali metals undergo complex
chemical reactions and transformation and are released as KOHaerosol,
KClaerosol, K2SO4aerosol, NaClaerosol, Na2SO4aerosol, and other compounds
[61]. As flue gas temperature decreases, some alkali metal aero-
sols grow and form submicron ash particles by mechanisms that

include nucleation, adsorption, condensation, and chemical reac-
tion. These then condense on the heating surfaces and form a sticky
initial slagging layer via thermophoresis and turbulent diffusion;
this sticky layer serves as an adhesive that bonds subsequent fly ash
to the heating surfaces [60,62] . Some alkali metal aerosols con-
dense on the surface of the fly ash and either form a sticky layer
or form low-melting substances by reaction with SiO2 [49] and Fe2O3
[62] contained in the fly ash. Furthermore, some alkali metal aero-
sols form low-temperature eutectic mixtures; for example,
Na2SO4 + NiSO4, which melts between 944 K and 1157 K [62], and
KCl + K2SO4, which melts at 823 K [63]. Subsequently, coarse fly ash,
with or without a self-surface sticky layer, is deposited on the surface
of the sticky initial slagging layer by inertial impaction [6,36]. Once
the initial slagging layer loses sufficient adhesion to accumulate
further coarse fly ash, a new sticky layer, mainly containing sub-
micron ash particles enriched in alkali metals, re-forms. The
accumulation of submicron alkali metal ash particles and the capture
of coarse ash particles result in the construction of an alternating
overlapping multi-layered structure [6]. This process of alkali-
induced slagging is shown in the top part of Fig. 3.

Aside from playing a supporting role in the formation of over-
lapping layered slagging, alkali metals, when combined with SiO2,
lead to agglomeration, as shown in Fig. 3. Accompanied by alkali-
induced slagging, partial alkali metals react with SiO2 in the fly ash
or bed material and transform into molten silicates, typically in FBs
or at FB temperatures [64,65]. For woody biomass containing K and

relatively low amounts of Si, a low-temperature K-silicate melt is
formed on the bed particle surfaces through a reaction with gaseous,
aerosols, or liquid K compounds. For agricultural biomass with high
K content and organically bound Si, agglomeration is attributed to
the direct adhesion of bed particles by partly molten ash-derived
K-silicate particle/droplet [64,65].

Unlike alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration where alkali
metals play a dominant role, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash
fusion) is more dependent on Si, Al, and other elements present in
the ash. Once the furnace temperature exceeds the melting point
of the ash, the ash undergoes deformation and melting and then
adheres to the heating surface by inertial impaction. Several studies
have indicated that the initial deformation temperature (IDT) in-
creases with reduced K2O and increased MgO, CaO, Fe2O3, Al2O3, and
SiO2 content in the ash [15]. Increased Si/Al leads to a decrease in
IDT because Al2O3 causes a greater increase than SiO2 in the ash
fusion temperature [7]. Meanwhile, refractory minerals (quartz,
metakaolinite, mullite, rutile, etc.) increase the ash fusion temper-
ature, whereas fluxing minerals (anhydrite, calcium silicate, hematite,
etc.) reduce it [66].

During combustion, only a small part of the inorganic compo-
nents are involved in alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced
slagging (ash fusion), and agglomeration; most are discharged along
with flue gas in the form of fly ash. Additionally, the large quanti-
ty of fly ash produces themselves product a problem. Given the
detailed schematics and discussions of the main ash-related issues

6

Y. Niu et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 52 (2016) 1–61

during biomass combustion shown in Figs. 1 and 3, alkali-induced
slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), and agglom-
eration may occur concurrently and should be studied in conjunction
rather than separately [67].

2.1. Alkali-induced slagging

Alkali-induced slagging is mainly associated with alkali metals,
especially alkali chlorides and sulfates. Therefore, for alkali-
induced slagging, more attention should be paid to the generation,
transformation, and sequestration of the corresponding volatile alkali
species, formation mechanisms, and criterion numbers or evalua-
tion indexes.

2.1.1. Mechanisms of the generation, transformation, and
sequestration of alkali species

During combustion, accompanied by the decomposition of the
organic structure (mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses,
lignin, lipid, protein, etc.), alkali metals are released and trans-
ported either in the form of solid particles or vapor species in the
combustion gas. Alkali metals in solid particles exist mainly as
M-silicates and M-aluminosilicates (M represents K and Na), and
alkali vapor species exist mainly in the forms of M(g), MCl(g),
(MCl)2(g), M2SO4(g), and MOH(g) [61]. Initially, alkali metals in
the form of both organic and inorganic Na and K compounds
enter the gas phase [68]; subsequently, in comparison with all
other ash-forming elements, the alkali metals form less stable
oxides [48], and the oxides may also be reduced by the carbon-
hydrogen fuel matrix into metal vapor at high combustion
temperatures. Then these alkali species readily react with water
vapor to form more stable and relatively volatile hydroxides
[KOH(g) and NaOH(g)]. During the in-flight process, some alkali
vapor species encounter a chemical environment that affects the
final transfer out of the flame (postflame conditions). Possible
gas-phase chemical reactions, including sulfation (R 1-R 3), chlo-
rination (R 4 and R 5), and carbonation (R 6), are listed below
[69,70]. Consequently, alkali sulfates, chlorides, and carbonates
together with silicates and aluminosilicates enter the postflame
flue gas and influence the ash-related issues.

Focusing on different types of biomass, Dayton and Milne [71]
identified the alkali vapor species by experiments in a variable-
temperature quartz-tube reactor equipped with a molecular beam
mass spectrometer (MBMS) system. They found that alkali sul-
fates are the primary alkali metal species released from the
combustion of woody biomass with relatively low alkali metal
content. Alkali chlorides are the primary alkali metal species
released during the combustion of herbaceous biomass, grasses,
and straws with high alkali metal and chlorine contents. Alkali

hydroxides are the most abundant alkali metal species in
the vapor during the combustion of biomass with high alkali
metal and low chlorine contents. Alkali cyanates are the domi-
nant alkali metal species released from biomass with high
alkali content and fuel-bound nitrogen. Similarly, Wei et al. [61]
studied K release during the processes of combustion and gasifi-
cation by means of the thermodynamic calculation tool, FACTSAGE,
and showed that for straw biomass with high K, Cl, and Si and low
S content, the main potassium species are KCl(g), KOH(g),
and K2Si4O9(l) above 1100 K; K2SO4(s2) and K2Si4O9(s,s2) from 800
to 1100 K; and KCl(s), K2SO4(s), and K2Si2O5(s) from 400 to 900 K.
For woody biomass with low K, Cl, and Si and high S content,
KCl(g), K2SO4(g), and KOH(g) are the primary potassium species
above 1100 K; KAlSi2O6(s,s2) and K2SO4(s2) are the major species
from 800 to 1100 K, and K2SO4(s) and KAl(SO4)2(s) from 400 to
900 K.

Thermodynamic calculations have also shown that the chlo-
rine content of biomass is an important parameter that facilitates
alkali release [61,69,71]. During combustion between 673 and
1273 K and with a constant K(g)/Cl(g) molar ratio of 1.0, KCl(g) is
the dominant product based on the calculation using HSC ignor-
ing the condensed phase of the alkali compounds; however, the
quantity of KCl(g) decreases with decreased concentrations of
Cl(g) and K(g) and results in an increased fraction of KOH(g),
which is attributed to the reverse reaction of R 4. When the
K(g)/Cl(g) molar ratio is lower than unity, a high chlorine content
promotes the release of KCl(g) from R 4 as expected, and there
almost no KOH(g) formed because of the presence of excess
chlorine that is released as HCl(g). When the K(g)/Cl(g) molar
ratio is higher than unity, above 1073 K, the excess potassium is
released in the form of KOH(g), whereas, below this temperature,
K2CO3 (g) is formed because of the carbonation of KOH(g) from R
6 as expected [69].

Fig. 4 illustrates the release of chlorine and alkali metals during
the combustion of Swedish wood and Danish straw with varying
air excess coefficients, up to a temperature of 1800 K, the results
are similar with above mentioned [61]. Fig. 4a shows that when the
concentrations of Cl and K are low (Swedish wood), the fraction of
KOH(g) is high at temperature above 1400 K. KCl(g) and KOH(g)
coexist between 1000 and 1800 K, but the concentration of KCl(g)
becomes greater than that of KOH(g) below 1400 K. Due to the con-
siderably large S/Cl mole ratio, the quantity of K2SO4(g) peaked at
1250 K occurs between 1400 and 1100 K. Detailed analysis of the
K balance and the slopes of the curves for KCl(g), KOH(g), HCl(g),
and K2SO4(g), shown in Fig. 4a, reveals that from 1800 to 1400 K,
the chlorination of KOH(g) by R 4 results in an equivalent reduc-
tion in KOH(g) and HCl(g) and an equivalent increase in KCl(g). From
1400 to 1250 K, the sulfations of both KCl(g) and KOH(g) (primar-
ily the sulfation of KOH(g) above 1250 K), i.e., R 1 and R 2, increase
the amount of K2SO4(g) and decrease that of both KOH(g) and KCl(g)
proportionally. However, between 1250 and 1100 K, the conden-
sation, silication and alumina-silication reactions shown as R 7-R
9 result in reduced K2SO4(g). Alternatively, the continuous de-
crease in KOH(g) and KCl(g) is attributed to silication and alumina-
silication reactions (R 10-R 13) between 1250 and 1000 K.

Fig. 4b shows that for straw biomass with high Cl, K, Si, and
K/Cl and low S/Cl, KCl(s) and KOH(g) exist above 900 and 1400 K,
respectively; these are the primary alkali vapor species in this
temperature range. From 1800 to 1000 K, both KCl(g) and KOH(g)
decrease because of either silication or alumina-silication reac-
labeled as R 10-R 13, and the amount of produced
tions,
HCl(g) increases. Below 1000 K, KCl continually decreases
because of condensation (R 14). This is good agreement with
experiment that indicate that potassium losses are positively
correlated with temperature and that the KCl(s,l) in ash disap-
pears completely above 1273 K during combustion or ashing [70].
The authors also found that Cl and KCl exist in ash incinerated

below 1088 K and disappear completely at increased tempera-
tures because of alumina-slication or sulfation or the evaporation
of KCl [15].

Fig. 4 also shows that oxygen has a certain influence on alkali
species transformation. Besides O2, the concentrations of SO2(g) and
H2O(g) also have considerable effects on alkali species transforma-
tion. Rs 1-6 indicate that the appearance of SO2(g), O2(g), and H2O(g)
promote sulfation and inhibit chlorination and carbonation. The ki-
netics effects of SO2(g), O2(g), and H2O(g) on KCl(s,l) and K2SO4(s,l),
i.e., the sulfation of KCl(s,l) expressed by R 15 have been studied
in detail. The kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Below
923 K, the reactions are essentially controlled by physical adsorp-
tion because of low activation energies; however, at around 923 K,
they transform from gas–solid reactions to gas–liquid reactions prob-
ably because of phase transition from solid to eutectic mixture of
potassium chlorides and sulfates [74,75]. The activation energy for
the gas–solid/liquid sulfation of MCl is approximately 146 ± 11 kJ/
mol, and the reaction orders of SO2(g), O2(g), and H2O(g) vary with
the changing conditions. These global kinetic descriptions provide
useful information on the kinetic simulation of sulfation of solid/
liquid alkali chlorides.

Focusing on the global gas–solid/liquid sulfation reactions of R
15, Henriksson and Warnqvist [76] proposed detailed reaction
mechanisms, which were subsequently adopted and improved by
Boonsongsup et al. [77] and Li et al. [78]. Henriksson and Warnqvist
[76] reported that SO2(g), O2(g), and H2O(g) are first adsorbed on
the surface of MCl. Then SO2(ads) reacts with O2(ads) to form
SO3(ads). H2O(ads) reacts with SO3(ads) to form H2SO4(ads). The prod-
ucts, M2SO4(s) and HCl(g), are obtained from the reaction between
H2SO4(ads) and MCl(g) with NaHSO3(ads) as an intermediate. The
researchers pointed out that adsorption of SO2(g) on the surface of
MCl(s) is the rate-limiting step, and O2(g) and H2O(g) are not in-
volved. Similarly, Boonsongsup et al. [77] emphasized that the
reaction rate is independent of O2 and H2O concentration under the
conditions employed (listed in Table 1). That is, oxygen and water
vapor are involved in a fast reaction step that does not control the
overall rate of reaction. The detailed Henriksson and Warnqvist re-
action mechanisms are shown below.

Most studies focused only on the gas–solid/liquid sulfation
reaction of alkali chlorides R 15. Research into the kinetics of the
gas–gas reactions of R 1–R 6 and gas–solid/liquid reactions of R
7–R 14, which are essential to understand the alkali transforma-
tions, is scarce. Li et al. [78] recently studied the homogenous
sulfation of KCl(g) from 950 to 1400 K in a multi-jet burner by
means of spectroscopy and elastic scattering. Experimental and
model predictions (Chemkin 4.1.1) showed that the gas-phase
sulfation of KCl(g) to K2SO4 (g) by the homogeneous nucleation of
K2SO4(g), a mechanism by which aerosols form, is favorable; in
addition, the sulfation rate is limited by the oxidation of SO2 to
SO3. This finding is supported by a recent industrial study con-
ducted by Kassman et al. [79], who reported that the injection of
ammonium sulfate, which serves as a source of SO3, is more
efficient than the injection of elemental sulfur in promoting KCl
sulfation.

As summarized in Table 2, the preliminary mechanisms of alkali–
salts generation and transformation, which clarify the alkali metal
chemistry during biomass combustion to a certain extent, are
deduced. During the process of combustion, alkali chemistry is af-
fected by the species, temperature, atmosphere, and concentrations
of K, Cl, and S. For biomass with high concentrations of Cl and K
and fired above 1400 K, KCl(g) is the dominant alkali vapor species.
KOH(g) is present when the Cl/K molar ratio is lower than unity.
K-silicates and K-aluminosilicates, which originate directly from ex-
ternal mineral sources or are generated by both alumina-silication
and silication reactions (R 10-R 13), are the major nonvolatile alkali
salts. As the temperature decreases to 1000 K, the concentration of
KCl(g), which remains the dominant alkali vapor species, de-
creases because of aumina-silication and silication reactions (R 10–R
13), whereas KOH(g) disappears completely because of sulfation (R
1 and R 2) and chlorination (R 4) reactions. When the flue gas tem-
perature is less than 1000 K, the remaining KCl(g) is transferred into
KCl(s,l) by condensation (R 14) or transferred into K2SO4(s,l) through
R 15.

For biomass with low concentrations of Cl and K and fired above
1400 K, KCl(g) remains the dominant alkali vapor species regard-
less of whether the Cl/K molar ratio is higher or lower than unity.
By contrast, the fraction of KOH(g) is higher than that of KCl(g) when
the Cl/K molar ratio is lower than unity. Meanwhile, the KOH(g) frac-
tion increases with the decrease in Cl(g) and K(g) concentrations,
i.e., when the concentrations of Cl and K are low, the KOH(g) frac-
tion is high, and the KCl(g) fraction and the mole ratio of KCl(g)/
KOH(g) are low. Between 1400 and 1000 K, KCl(g) and KOH(g) remain
the primary alkali vapor species. However, K2SO4(g, l) is generated
via R 1, R 2, and R 7 when S is present in the fuel. Below 1000 K,
the remaining K vapor is transformed into KCl(s,l) and K2SO4(s,l).
Although research on the sulfation of MCl is relatively compre-
hensive, kinetics research, particularly on R 1–R 14, which are
essential for the transformation and sequestration of alkali species,
requires further investigation. Moreover, the existing kinetics mecha-
nisms should be checked carefully.

2.1.2. Mechanisms of the formation and growth of alkali-induced
slagging

Primary deposits form directly on the tube itself very rapidly
because of mineralogical reactions. These deposits have a high
content of alkali sulfates and chlorides, which, because of their low
melting points, both function as glue for the secondary deposits.
Wang et al. [80] conducted a biomass combustion experiment
in a drop-tube furnace and pointed out that sulfates and chlorides
are the key species that contribute to the formation of ash depos-
its in a biomass furnace, particularly sulfates. Gaseous KCl and SO2
are released during high-temperature biomass combustion. Some
of the SO2 is further oxidized into SO3, which then reacts with KCl
to form K2SO4 and KHSO4. The concentration of KCl in the flue gas
is significantly reduced after sulfation. As the gas temperature further
decreases, alkali sulfates begin to nucleate and condense forming
nanoscale aerosols. A part of the K2SO4 reacts with SO3 to form K2S2O7,
which has a low melting point. The K2SO4 and K2S2O7 aerosols tend
to deposit on low-temperature tube surfaces, resulting in an in-
crease in the ash deposition rate, as observed in many biomass-
fired power plants. The transformation of SO2 to SO3 has a relatively
low reaction rate and is a major limiting step in the sulfation and
deposition processes. For crop straw, the alkali and chlorine con-
tents are high, and the alkali elements are mainly released as
chlorides at high temperatures. The chlorides are then converted
into sulfates in the presence of SO2 and SO3. A decrease in temper-
ature causes the sulfates to nucleate and condense, form aerosol
particles, and finally deposit on the tube wall surface. The alkali
content of wood is high but the chlorine content is low; conse-
quently, the alkali elements are mainly released as NaOH and KOH,

which then react with SO2 and SO3 to form sulfates. The high silicon
content in wood means that there are many silicates nuclei for use
as nuclei for the nucleation and condensation of sulfates.

Recently, as shown in Fig. 5, a detailed alkali-induced slagging
formation and growth mechanism was proposed [12] based on com-
parable experimental data from utility furnaces [6,81]. The slagging
formation is governed by the re-enrichment of fine particles, re-
capturing of coarse particles, and the existence of an initial slagging
layer. Fine particles that contain high concentrations of K, Na, Cl,
and S, in the forms of KCl and K3Na(SO4)2, are initially deposited and
enriched on the heating surfaces; then, they trap coarse and large
particles containing high Si, Al, and other elements. Fine particles
are re-enriched when they are unable to adhere to coarse and large
particles, which promotes the layer-by-layer formation and the
growth of slagging. A fatal initial layer that primarily contains fine
KCl and K3Na(SO4)2 particles evidently bonds the slagging tightly
onto the heating surface before the formation of the alternating
layers. The slagging process will be retarded if the initial layer is
destroyed or inhibited.

The slagging growth mechanisms for biomass are further refined
by factoring in the alternating layered structure that is observed in
biomass utility boiler (Fig. 5). K is released into the gas flow during
the combustion process as KCl(aerosol) and K2SO4(aerosol), both of which
undergo complex chemical reactions and transformations. For
example, volatile S is oxidized into SO2. Some alkali chloride aero-
sols are then sulfated or alumina-silicified, whereas some alkali
sulfate aerosols generated by the sulfates of alkali chlorides or that
originate directly from biomass combustion may also be alumina-
silicified. This reduces the concentration of both alkali chloride and
sulfate aerosols in the flue gas. When the Cl ratio ((Cl + K2O + Na2O)/
(SiO2 + Al2O3)) and S ratio ((SVolatile + K2O + Na2O)/(SiO2 + Al2O3))
decrease, the concentration of both alkali chloride and sulfate aero-
sols in the flue gas decrease, which is advantageous to slagging
reduction. However, when both the Cl and S ratios increase, the con-
centrations of alkali chloride and sulfate aerosols in the flue gas
increase, thereby promoting slagging. Some alkali metal aerosols
condense on the heating surface at lower flue gas temperatures and
form an initial sticky slagging layer by thermophoresis and turbu-
lent diffusion. This sticky layer functions as an adhesive that bonds
the subsequent deposits and heating surfaces together. Partial alkali
metal aerosols condense on the surface of fly ash and result either
in the formation of a sticky layer or further react with SiO2 and Fe2O3
to generate low-temperature melting substances. Coarse fly ashes
with or without a sticky layer are then deposited on the surface of
the sticky initial slagging layer by inertial impaction. Fine par-
ticles that contain high concentrations of K, Na, Cl, and S in the form
of KCl and K3Na(SO4)2 are initially deposited and enriched; they then
capture coarse and large particles that contain higher Si, Al, and other
elements. When the fine particles are unable to adhere to coarse
large particles, they undergo re-enrichment. This process pro-
motes the layer-by-layer formation and growth of slagging. These
alternating overlapping multi-layered slagging structures have also
been reported in References 3,6,81,82.

2.1.3. Criterion numbers or evaluation indexes

Several researchers have recently focused on criterion numbers
or evaluation indexes to solve alkali-induced slagging fundamen-
tally and provide useful guidelines for the selection of co-firing fuel,
additives, and the type of biomass fired in utility boilers. Davidsson
et al. [52] estimated the extent of biomass slagging through the alkali
index (AI = kg(K2O + Na2O)/GJ) that is used for the evaluation of coal
slagging. Slagging is probable when the AI is in the range 0.17–
0.34 kg GJ−1 and is almost certain at greater value. Oleschko and
Muller [53], Diaz-Ramirez et al. [54], and Vamvuka et al. [55] pro-
posed (Na + K+2Mg+2Ca)/S, (K + Na)/(Ca + Mg), and S/Cl as evaluation
indexes, respectively. In addition, Jenkins et al. [83] and Jiang et al.

[84] employed the base-to-acid ratio used for coal (Rb/a
= (Fe2O3 + CaO + MgO + K2O + Na2O)/(SiO2 +TiO + Al2O3)) to esti-
mate biomass slagging. However, Ye [85] and Hu et al. [86] have
emphasized that the evaluation indexes of coal cannot reliably
predict the slagging behavior of biomass and proposed a new
biomass slagging evaluation index (MgO + Al2O3 + Fe2O3)/(CaO + P2O5).
When the index value is less than 0.7, the softening temperature
(ST) is less than 1000 °C; when it is above 1.7, ST is greater than
1200 °C. Although many evaluation indexes have been investi-
gated, most are based on laboratory data, and few originate from
commercial utility boilers or were verified based on industry prac-
tice. Moreover, the key elements, Si, Al, K, Cl, and S, which are
essential for alkali transformation and alkali-induced slagging, are
not accounted for simultaneously.

Alternatively, a set of criterion numbers for alkali-induced slagging
(Exp 1), based on a series of experimental results on utility boilers
(Table 3 shows a summary of the Cl and S ratios for different fuels
burning in different utility boilers), was recently established by the
authors [12].

slight slagging

Severe slagging occurs when the Cl ratio and S ratio are greater
than 2.4 and 1.9, respectively. Slight slagging occurs when the Cl
ratio and S ratio are lower than 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. Slagging
becomes severe with increasing Cl ratio and S ratio in the ranges
of 1.0–2.4 and 0.5–1.9, respectively. Elled et al. [27] and Wang et al.
[87] conducted research on deposit by co-firing in utility and small-
scale furnaces. They further verified the abovementioned suggestion.
Elled et al. [27] conducted deposit research on high potassium fuels
(wood and straw) in a 12 MW CFB furnace and reported that the
slagging rate decreases by co-firing with sludge that contains high
Si2O + Al2O3 and low K2O + Na2O that results in lower Cl and S ratios.
Similar results were reported by Wang et al. [87]. They added sewage
sludge with low Cl ratio and S ratio to wood to reduce slagging.
Therefore, the quantitative criterion numbers (Cl ratio and S ratio)
can provide a useful guideline for the selection of biomass, addi-
tives, and co-firing fuel fired in utility boilers.

Although the criterion numbers (Cl ratio and S ratio) consider
the essential elements (Si, Al, K, Cl, and S) that influence both alkali
transformations and alkali-induced slagging, they must be further
evaluated and improved because of the limited numbers of sur-
veyed items listed in Table 3. Also, a criterion number that can
provide a practical guideline must be repeatedly verified and
improved.

2.2. Silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion)

Biomass ash-related problems are not only related to chlorine
and alkali metals but are also closely related to the biomass ash
fusion characteristics (AFC). AFC is an important factor in deter-
mining the propensity of fuels to form fused or partly fused slag
deposits on heating surfaces in boilers [14]. Although thermal anal-
ysis (TGA/DTA), thermochemical calculations, and lab-scale sintering
tests [13,54] can be used to predict silicate melt-induced slagging,
the ash fusion test is a more useful method to quantitatively provide
information on the properties of different biomass. This is espe-
cially true for the initial deformation temperature (IDT), which is
dependent on the proportions of the elements in the biomass ash,
and is employed to guide biomass boiler design [7]. Meanwhile, many
AFC assessment methods, such as ternary phase diagrams

Fig. 6. Schematic of the ash fusion tester and an example for testing (adapted from references 7,15).
Upper image: system diagram of AFC tester; bottom-left image: testing process; bottom-right image: IDT identification

[48,67,88–93] and stepwise regression [94,95] involving a large
number of predictors that are expected to influence AFC, can be ac-
quired from the results of ash fusion test and ash composition
analysis.

2.2.1. Ash fusion test

Ash fusion temperatures (AFT), including IDT, ST, hemisphere tem-
perature (HT), and fluidized temperature (FT), comprise the most
effective and direct methods of AFC evaluation. Generally, ash fusion
testing is conducted with an automatic ash fusion temperature ana-
lyzer, which mainly consists of a temperature controllable electric
heating furnace and a high-precision digital read-out and photo-
graphic record camera (Fig. 6). IDT, ST, HT, and FT are identified from
the ash cone with the camera.

In ashing, which is the first step in biomass AFC research, the
selection of the correct ashing temperature is vital. For example, a
low ashing temperature results in unburned carbon in the ash and
affects the AFC assessment; in contrast, a high ashing temperature
leads to over-volatilization and sintering, and these also influence
the AFC assessment. Unfortunately, the ideal ashing temperature
for biomass remains uncertain to date. For example, the America
ASTM/E870-82 employs 600 °C, European SS-ISO540 employs 550 °C
[96], and Chinese GB/T212-2001 adopts 815 °C that is used for the
coal ashing process because of the lack of biomass ashing stan-
dard. Thy et al. [70], as individuals, used an ashing temperature of
525 °C. With the aim of establishing a consistent biomass ashing
temperature, Xiao et al. [97] recommended the adoption of 600 °C
through analysis of the physicochemical properties of biomass at
different ashing temperatures. Wang et al. [84] studied the fusion
characteristics of three seaweed ashes and reported that neither
600 °C nor 815 °C was suitable for seaweed biomass because the
generation of high-melting material at these temperatures influ-
ences the identification of ash fusion points. Consequently, they
proposed that a lower ashing temperature (530 °C) is a more suitable.

Although the ashing fusion test can provide information on the
propensity of silicate melt-induced slagging for a specified fuel, the
testing procedure used has considerable effects on the results [90].
Firstly, an aluminous cement tile is usually employed to support the
specimen, but it is attacked by the basic ash that forms after the
experiment, which may lead to unreliable readings. The ASTM stan-
dard specifies the adoption of a kaolin/aluminum oxide support and
ignores altogether the problem of its being attacked by ash. Mean-
while, the DIN standard specifies the use of a platinum tile. Secondly,
several samples display swelling during melting because of the con-
tinuous combustion of unburned carbon in the ash, which affects
the identification of IDT. Therefore, all observations showing swell-
ing and measurement on re-ignited ash should be discarded.

Although ash fusion testing as an effective method to predict sil-
icate melt-induced slagging during combustion has many problems
(including identifying the ashing temperature, selection of the ashing
container or specimen support, and even the choice of an ashing
standard) that must be overcome, the method remains in wide
application.

2.2.2. Effects of chemical compositions on AFC

As a major inducing factor for melt-induced slagging and bed
agglomeration, AFCs depend not only on chemical composition but
also on mineral composition [88]. For example, IDT as an evalua-
tion index for AFC increases as MgO, CaO, Fe2O3, and Al2O3 content
increase, and decreases with increasing K2O content in ash [15]. Re-
fractory minerals (quartz, metakaolinite, mullite, rutile, etc.) increase
AFTs, whereas fluxing minerals (anhydrite, calcium silicate, hema-
tite, etc.) reduce them [66]. The main elements in the slag are silicon,
aluminum, calcium, potassium, and oxygen, and the principal mineral
components are Ca2MgSi2O7, KAlSiO4, SiO2, and others [13,15,16].
Hence, related research has mainly focused on the analysis of the
elemental and mineral compositions of ashes prepared by the ashing
of pure biomass or simulated ash by adding various metal oxides

into biomass or mixing various metal oxides directly at a certain
temperature by XRF, ICP, SEM-EDS, XRD, TG and AFC testing instru-
ments [7,15,16,84].

For coal analysis, ST is widely used as an evaluation index. For
biomass, it is suggested that IDT should be adopted because of the
lack of sensitivity of ST, HT, and FT to the elements present in biomass
ash [15,16]. Ashing experiments conducted on three agricultural resi-
dues at 400, 600, 815, 1000, 1200, and 1400 °C showed that IDT
increases as K2O concentration decreases and as MgO, CaO, Fe2O3, and
Al2O3 concentrations in the ash increase. ST, HT, and FT are obviously
unaffected by both the concentrations of each element and the ashing
temperature. Li et al. [7] further extended the biomass species or cor-
responding ash species by means of 8 biomass ashes and 27 simulated
ashes prepared by mixing organic and inorganic oxides at 580 and
815 °C, respectively, and obtained similar results. Recently, the authors
[67] conducted research on silicate melt-induced slagging on basis
of the ash properties of 30 biomasses burned in operating power plants
and found that IDT can be used as the evaluation index for silicate
melt-induced slagging. IDT increases as Al2O3 and SiO2/K2O increase,
but decreases as K2O, SiO2, SiO2/Al2O3, and (SiO2 + K2O)/Al2O3 in-
crease. As shown in Fig. 7, which presents a statistical analysis of
the effects of various components on IDT, these compounds can
be arranged in order of
their decreasing effect on IDT:
Al2O3 > K2O > SiO2 > SiO2/K2O > SiO2/Al2O3 > (SiO2 + K2O)/Al2O3. However,
because of the limited number of samples, more research is re-
quired before the use of IDT in a practical setting.

On the other hand, the authors [15] pointed out that the eval-
uation of biomass AFC should not be based simply on their elemental
composition, except IDT, but also on the high-temperature molten
material that provides structural support for the skeleton-like struc-
ture in biomass ash. Neither the high-temperature molten material
nor the skeleton structure in biomass ash is influenced by ashing
temperature. Fig. 8 shows the TG-DTG curves of capsicum straw
ashed at 400, 600, and 815 °C, respectively. The ashes prepared by
ashing at 400, 600, and 815 °C experience three, two, and one weight
loss peaks, respectively, and these weight loss peaks overlap. Re-
gardless of the ashing temperature, when the heating temperature
is higher than a certain value (860 °C for the ashes of capsicum
straw), the compositions of the ash are found to be either similar
or to contain the same high-temperature molten material. The
authors [16] further pointed out that the skeleton structure con-
sists of quartz, potassium iron oxide, and silicates through crystal
identification in the corresponding ashes further ashed at 1000, 1200,
and 1400 °C. The silicates mainly exist in the form of potassium mag-
nesium silicate, potassium aluminum silicate, potassium calcium
silicate, calcium silicate, mullite, diopside, pyrope, monticellite, and
other minerals. Therefore, aside from the elemental compositions,
we should also pay attention to the mineral species present in the
ash. Furthermore, Vassilev et al. [66] reported that refractory min-
erals (quartz, metakaolinite, mullite, rutile, etc.) increase AFTs,
whereas fluxing minerals (anhydrite, calcium silicate, hematite, etc)
reduce them.

2.2.3. Evolution of chemical compositions in ash during combustion

To determine the effects of both elemental and mineral com-
positions on AFC, the evolution of the chemical composition of the
ash during combustion has been widely investigated [15,98].

2.2.3.1. Effects of temperature on mineral compositions. In the past
five years, our research group has devoted considerable attention
to the evolution of the chemical composition of the ashes over dif-
ferent ashing temperatures and presented the substances existing
forms and provided detailed reactions by analyzing the ash com-
position from different combustion temperatures [15,16]. The
identification of the crystalline phases of capsicum straw ashed at
400, 600, 815, 1000, 1200, and 1400 °C is shown in Fig. 9. The main
components of capsicum straw ashes formed at 400 °C are quartz,
sylvite, arcanite, fairchildite, calcite, potassium iron oxide, and mag-
nesium oxide. As the ashing temperature increases, calcite and
fairchildite disappear and calcium silicide is generated at 600 °C by
R 23 and R 24; meanwhile, at 600 °C when carbon is completely
burned off, Ca2SiO4 is substituted by CaSi2 through R 25. At 815 °C,
sylvite disappears and this is accompanied by the appearance of
zeolite (R 26) and leucite (R 27). At 1000 °C, periclase and calcium

silicate disappear and are converted into akermanite (R 28-R 30)
and calcium magnesium silicate (R 28, R 31, and R 32), respective-
ly. At 1200 °C, arcanite and calcium silicate react together to form
potassium calcium silicate and SO2 (R 33). At 1400 °C, the ash is fully
molten, and quartz, pyrope, and monticellite are identified as the
major components. In addition, potassium aluminum silicate and
potassium iron oxide are identified as the minor components. This
is summarized in detail in Table 4. Li et al. [7] also reported that
K2Ca(CO3)2 and KCl are the major phasese at 580 °C, and KCl, CaO
and MgO at 815 °C.

For low-temperature ash properties, Vamvuka and Zografos [99]
conducted similar research at 600, 780, and 900 °C. They reported
that both calcium and fairchildite exist in the ash prepared at 600 °C
and disappeared at temperature greater than 600 °C; potassium va-
porizes between 780 and 900 °C. The results are consistent with the
above observation. Thy et al. [70] conducted similar research using
wood, rice straw, and wheat straw ashed between 525 and 1425 °C
and reported that larnite emerges at 718 °C accompanying the dis-
appearance of calcium. Furthermore, aluminum silicate pericline
forms at approximately 815 °C, and sylvite completely disappears
at 1011 °C. Overall, the research results are similar except for the
temperature at which sylvite disappears. However, this may be
caused by the lack of precision of XRD analysis or the experimen-
tal conditions. Consequently, further studies are required.

2.2.3.2. Effects of

temperature on elemental compositions.
Accompanied by the changes in mineral compositions of the ash,
the elemental content of the ash also change significantly; in par-
ticular, the changes in the presence of volatile elements directly
influence the formation of submicron particles that accelerate alkali-
induced slagging.

Johansen et al. [100] studied the release of K, Cl, and S during
the pyrolysis and combustion of corn. The results showed that the
release of K and Cl is closely related. K is released in significant quan-
tities in the temperature range of 700–800 °C in the form of KCl,
and only 5%–10% of mass loss occurs at temperature below 700 °C.
Cl is fully released at 800 °C, and Cl in excess of K is released in the
form of HCl. Organic S is released below 500 °C, and inorganic S is
released above 900 °C in the form of aerosolized K2SO4 and SO2,
which is formed by the decomposition of K2SO4. A similar result was
achieved by analyzing the elemental concentrations of the ash by

XRF. The release properties of the volatile element K, S, and Cl are
illustrated in Fig. 10 [15,16].

Fig. 10 shows that because K, S and Cl are increasingly released
as the temperature increases, the ashing ratios of the three straws
decrease until 1200 °C. Then they remain either unchanged or de-
crease slightly between 1200 °C and 1400 °C. Below 600 °C, the
reduced ashing ratios are mainly attributed to the release of K and
organic S. Between 600 °C and 815 °C, the reduction is mainly caused
by the release of K and Cl, possibly in the forms of KCl aerosol [100]
and HCl (via R 26 and R 27). Cl concentration is essentially zero at
815 °C. However, between 815 °C and 1200 °C, K concentration de-
creases because of the volatility of KOH and K2SO4 aerosols [100].
Meanwhile, inorganic S is released in the form of SO2 by the de-
composition of K2SO4 (R 33). All these conditions result in the
continuing decrease of the ashing ratio as temperature increase until
1200 °C. At temperature above 1200 °C, ash melts and the ashing
ratios remain constant or decrease slightly.

2.2.4. Chemical equilibrium calculation

Compared with experiment, chemical equilibrium calculations
are economically feasible and quick. They can also provide system-
atic information on the behavior of different fuels and can be further
utilized to reduce or prevent ash-related issues inherent in the
thermo-conversion of biofuels [18]. Therefore, simulation tools such
as FACTSAGE [31,56–58,70] and HSC [69] have been used exten-
sively. Utilizing FACTSAGE, Brus et al. [56] and Chen et al. [57]
reported that during biomass combustion, K exists mainly in the
forms of KOH(g), K2SO4(g), KAlSiO4(s), KAlSi2O6(s), and KCl(s,g). Sim-
ilarly, Nutalapati et al. [31] employed FACTSAGE to study the effect
of temperature on the existing forms of K, and pointed out that
gaseous potassium mainly exists as KCl(g) below 900 °C, whereas
KCl(g) and KOH(g) co-exist between 900 °C and 1600 °C, and K2SO4(g)
only exists at approximately 1200 °C. The KOH(g) concentration de-
creases as temperature decreases.

However, Thy et al. [70], who compared the results of FACTSAGE
simulation calculations and experiment concerning the high-
temperature elemental loss of rice straw ash, wheat straw ash, and
wood ash from 525 °C to 1425 °C, reported that FACTSAGE has sig-
nificant drawbacks. For example, for wood ash, FACTSAGE fails to
predict the formation of phosphor-nearing larnite that is ob-
served experimentally; In addition, the release of potassium is

restricted to temperatures near or above its liquidus; in contrast,
low temperature release is experimentally observed. Further-
more, for rice straw, the FACTSAGE results are in contrast with
experiment. Additionally, for wheat ash, FACTSAGE calculation sug-
gests a very low initial melting temperature and a high liquidus in
comparison with the experimental results [70].

The ash transformation reactions during slagging may be influ-
enced by temperature, residence time, air supply, flue gas velocity,
and other factors [48]. Ash transformation reactions in both grate
furnace and FB environments can reach equilibrium because of their
long residence time and the good contact between gaseous mate-
rials and solid initial ash. However, in the flame of a powder burner,
although the gas-phase reactions are promoted because of high tem-
perature and turbulence that favor the formation of chlorides,
sulfates, and carbonates, the interactions between ash and gas are
limited because of their limited residence times; the system is far
from being in equilibrium [48].

Simulation tools can provide guidance, but should be further per-
fected because deviations from experiment results. A combination
of heterogeneous chemical kinetics and multiphase equilibrium
models is essential, and good chemical estimates of the specia-
tion, saturation levels, and the presence of a melt of the ash-
forming matter must be available to obtain reliable results [48].

2.2.5. Multi-component phase diagram

Multi-component phase diagrams have been proposed as an ef-
fective tool to forecast AFC, i.e., the propensity of an ash with a given
composition to form a molten slagging. Phase diagram allow rapid
assessment of the AFC of a particular fuel in comparison with du-
plicate AFC experiments. They can also provide a general guide to
the major mineral phases present via comparison with the phase
diagrams of the major oxides [90]. Many phase diagrams, includ-
ing those of SiO2-CaO-Al2O3 [88], SiO2-CaO-Fe2O3 [88], SiO2-Al2O3-
K2O [67], K2O-Na2O-CaO-MgO-SiO2 [48], K2O-CaO-SiO2 [48], Al2O3-
SiO2-TiO2 [89], Al2O3-Fe2O3-SiO2 [89], Al2O3-CaO-SiO2 [89], and CaO-
SiO2-Al2O3-Fe2O3 [90], have been proposed. Given the limited
dimensions of the multi-component phase diagrams, Bostrom et al.
[48] employed a pseudo-ternary phase diagram, K2O-CaO-SiO2, as
a substitute for the K2O-Na2O-CaO-MgO-SiO2 phase diagram and
used this to predict the molten slagging tendencies of woody
biomass (shown in Fig. 11). Owing to the high melting tempera-
ture, the propensity to form silicate-based molten slagging is low
for fuel that has a relatively high basic oxide/silica ratio, i.e.,
((K2O + Na2O + CaO + MgO)/SiO2). However, fine particle formation
increases toward the “K2O(+Na2O)” corner of the triangle, particu-
larly close to the basic oxide binary component. This may be the
reason that Li et al. [7] found that, for high potassium samples, the

18

Y. Niu et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 52 (2016) 1–61

[15], IDT is mainly related to the concentrations of K2O, MgO, CaO,
Fe2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2. Therefore, multicomponent phase diagram that
includes the major components K2O-Na2O-CaO-MgO-SiO2-Al2O3-
Fe2O3-TiO2 will be more accurate.

As indicated by the abovementioned proposed ternary phase dia-
grams, biomass AFC evaluation diagrams can be expressed by alkali
metals or fluxing basic oxides (K2O + Na2O for oxidizing and
K2O + Na2O + FeO for reducing)–alkali earth metals or non-fluxing
basic oxides (CaO + MgO)–fluxing acidic oxides (SiO2 + TiO2 + P2O5))–
non-fluxing acidic oxides (Al2O3 + Fe2O3 for oxidizing and Al2O3 for
reducing). Indeed, several other components, such as the fluxing
acidic oxide B2O3, fluxing basic oxide Mn2O4, and the non-fluxing
basic oxides BaO and SrO, are ignored because of their minor or trace
concentrations. Therefore, two triangular prism AFC phase dia-
grams, namely, (K2O + Na2O)–(CaO + MgO)–(SiO2 + TiO2 + P2O5)–
(Al2O3 + Fe2O3) for oxidation and (K2O + Na2O + FeO)–(CaO + MgO)–
(SiO2 + TiO2 + P2O5)–Al2O3 for reduction, can be used to reveal the
propensity to form melt-induced slagging for ashes with a given
composition and predict their mineral composition determined by
crystalline phase identification from experiment.

Although (K2O + Na2O)–(CaO + MgO)–(SiO2 + TiO2 + P2O5)–
(Al2O3 + Fe2O3) for oxidizing conditions and (K2O + Na2O + FeO)–
(CaO + MgO)–(SiO2 + TiO2 + P2O5)–Al2O3 for reducing conditions can
effectively predict the AFC, having the phases cover all elements
with weight or mole percentages from 0% to 100% is unrealistic.
Therefore, further simplification is necessary by approximating
the behaviors of Mg and Na to be similar to those of Ca and K,
respectively. Considering that both Fe2O3 and Al2O3 increase IDT
[7,15,101] and the lower concentration of Fe2O3 in ash than that of
Al2O3, the phase diagram can be expressed as (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-
Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3. Ma denotes alkali metals,
including K and Na. Mae denotes alkaline earth metals, including
Ca and Mg. Al is the sum of Al and Fe. Therefore, the acquisition of
the pseudo 4D phase diagrams (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-
MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3 can provide a more effective guideline for AFC
than a simple ternary phase diagram. Acquisition of the data to
build this phase diagram, of course, requires much experimental
work.

As shown in Fig. 12, the authors [67] recently constructed a SiO2-
Al2O3-K2O ternary phase diagram based on the ash properties of 30

ash fusion test cannot correctly predict ash slagging and deposi-
tion trends because potassium is released during the ashing
procedure under the ash fusion testing conditions.

For coal, Gray [90] also considered all the components and pro-
posed a ternary diagram where the vertical axes are percent base
((CaO + MgO + FeO + Na2O + K2O + etc.) for reducing atmosphere and
(CaO + MgO + Na2O + K2O + etc.) for oxidizing atmosphere)), percent
fluxing acidic oxides (SiO2 + TiO2 + P2O5 + B2O3), and percent non-
fluxing acidic oxides (Al2O3 for reducing and Al2O3 + Fe2O3 for oxidizing).
Al2O3 always behaves as a non-fluxing acid. Fe behaves as a non-
fluxing acid for the oxidizing condition in the form of Fe2O3 and as a
basic oxide under a reducing atmosphere in the form of FeO. Unfor-
tunately, no experimental determination of such a phase diagram exists,
and further specification and simplification are necessary. However,
according to the research results of Li et al. [7] and our previous study

biomasses burned in operating power plants. Surprisingly, the ternary
phase diagrams well predicted the IDT of the pure biomass, and the
predicted values of pure biomass based on the ternary phase diagram
are consistent with the experimental values; however, the exper-
imental IDTs of biomass containing additional SiO2 and kaolin are
approximately 220 and 80 K lower than the predicted values, re-
spectively. Therefore, although both pure biomass and biomass
containing additional aluminosilicate compounds share the same
K2O-SiO2-Al2O3 construction, the latter has a lower IDT because of
the additional low-melting substances generated from the silication
reaction (R 8) induced by the addition of aluminosilicate com-
pounds. As a result, the K2O-SiO2-Al2O3 ternary diagram constructed
based on pure K2O, SiO2, and Al2O3 underestimates the IDT and is
unsuitable for predicting the AFC of pure biomass because of the
excessive generation of low-melting substances.

To easily predict the AFC or potential melt-induced slagging prop-
erties, the pseudo-4D phase diagrams, both (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-
Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3, which provide a more effective
guideline for AFC than the simple ternary phase diagrams, should
be constructed based on statistical data from real biomass ashes
rather than from simulated ashes obtained by the addition of certain
metal oxides to the biomass/biomass ashes or by the direct mixing
of different metal oxides.

2.3. Agglomeration

With the advantages of being insensitive to changes in fuel prop-
erties and having low operating temperatures, fluidized bed boilers
are particularly suitable for biomass combustion. However, bed ag-
glomeration induced by the inorganic fuel components is a major
problem. In the worst case, it results in defluidization and unsched-
uled shutdown of the entire power plant [30]. Generally, the
agglomeration tendency depends on the bed material [20,91,102],
fuel [17,19,20,91], and operating conditions [20,91].

2.3.1. Effects of bed materials and fuels

The chemical composition of the bed particle layer exhibits a
strong dependence on the bed material and the fuel ash composi-
tion. An agglomerated bed particle generally consists of several
superimposed layers with different properties and compositions
[19,56]; the inner layers are more dependent on the bed material
composition, and the outer layers have a composition that is more
similar to those of the fuel ash [56,91,102]. Generally, the thick-
ness of the coating around the bed material grains is approximately
2–50 μm, whether measured in a laboratory reactor or a commercial-
scale FB [19,103,104]. The elemental composition of the
homogeneous inner layer formed on the quartz bed materials is
dominated by Si, K, and Ca, which are responsible for the agglom-
eration of quartz sand [56,102]. For an olivine bed, the inner
composition layer consists mainly of Mg, Si, and Ca [102]; in com-
parison with a quartz bed, the agglomeration is slight because Mg
increases the melting temperature of pure potassium silicate [17].
For blast-furnace slag as the bed material, the granular outer coating
layer is the main component of the “glue” in the formed bed ag-
glomeration necks and melts at the higher temperature range of
800 °C to 1000 °C; thus, it can reduce agglomeration to a certain
extent. According to chemical equilibrium calculations using
FACTSAGE, the reduced agglomeration tendency of olivine and blast-
furnace slag, when used as the bed materials, is due to the low
chemical driving force for K to react with and be retained on the
bed materials [56,102]. Otherwise, K-feldspars and plagioclase, which
are the two main components of natural sand, have distinct influ-
ence on the agglomeration tendency of different fuels [17]. They do
not influence the agglomeration of K- and Si-rich fuels (such as wheat
straw); however, plagioclase reacts with fuel potassium increas-
ing the initial defluidization temperature for K-rich biomass residues

by forming leucite. K-feldspars aggravates the agglomeration of K-
and Ca-rich fuels (such as bark) because the introduction of Al to
a potassium silicate melt lowers the melting temperature at high
K/Al and low (K2 + Al2)/Si ratios [17].

Ohman et al. [19] reported that the layers covering the bed par-
ticles are homogenous, but that the elemental distributions of the
coating vary significantly between bed samples from different fuels.
Generally, compared with trace amounts of Na, Mg, and Al, the dom-
inant elements are Si, K, and Ca in all coatings, as shown in Fig. 13.
The distribution of Si, K, and Ca matches that of the sample well.
The lights regions in the SEM-EDS images represent the element
distribution. A SiO2-CaO-K2O ternary system is therefore proposed
to evaluate the melt behavior of typical woody biomass fuels that
contain high Ca and K and low Si [102]. For K- and Si-rich agricul-
tural residues such as wheat straw, agglomeration is not influenced
by the bed material; the major coating elements are Si and K, and
the fuel ash itself melts causing the bed agglomerate before layer
can develop [17]. For P-rich fuels, alkali and alkali earth phos-
phates should be formed first followed by sulfates, chlorides, silicates,
carbonates, and hydroxides. This is probably because of the greater
acidity of P2O5(g) than SO2(g)/SO3(g), HCl(g), SiO2(g), and CO2(g) in
the competition for the basic components, i.e., KOH(l,g), NaOH(l,g),
CaO(s), and MgO(s). K-Ca phosphates and K-Mg phosphates favor
agglomeration reduction because of the high stability of phos-
phate compounds [65].

2.3.2. Agglomeration formation mechanisms

Agglomeration is dependent on the chemical characteristics and
melting behavior of the coating, which are sensitive to the rela-
tive amount of calcium and potassium in the fuel [19]. Increasing
Ca content moves the composition toward regions with high melting
temperatures, whereas increasing K concentration moves the com-
position toward regions with low eutectic temperatures [92]. Grimm
et al. [102] reported that bed particle layer formation and bed ag-
glomeration are associated with the direct adhesion of particles by
partly molten fuel ash derived from K-Mg phosphates in fuels rich
in S, P, K, and Mg, and from K-silicates in fuels rich in Si and K.
Melissari [14] agreed with these reports and defined agglomera-
tion as a result of two phenomena: (1) accumulation of low-
melting salts of potassium and phosphorous, and (2) reaction of
potassium phosphate with Si and Ca to generate low-melting sili-
cates of potassium and calcium.

As shown in Fig. 14, Visser et al. [20,105] summarized two dif-
ferent routes for agglomeration, namely, “melt-induced”
agglomeration (a) and “coating-induced” agglomeration (b). In “melt-
induced” agglomeration, the bed particles adhere together via a
molten phase because of the high local peak temperature, which
roughly matches the chemical composition of the ash. In “coating-
induced” agglomeration, which is commonly observed in
commercially operated fluidized-bed combustors, a uniform coating
is presented on the surface of the bed material grains. Along with
coating thickness and/or temperature increase, a neck formation may
occur between coatings of the individual grains; such formation ini-
tiates agglomeration [20]. After the first neck formation,
defluidization of the bed particle results in a localized high-
temperature zone that favors melt formation and promotes
agglomeration. Similarly, Liu et al. [30] pointed out that the for-
mation of agglomeration is caused by “melt-induced” agglomeration
mechanisms (ash particle size approaching 30 μm) and “coating-
induced” agglomeration mechanisms (ash particle size approaching
10 μm); large ash particles (>10 μm) and small ash particles (<10 μm)
are responsible for the formation of melt and coating, respectively.
Ohman et al. [19] further detailed the formation process of ag-
glomeration, especially concerning the formation of coating layer,
as shown in Fig. 15. Firstly, ash deposition occurs on the bed ma-
terial by a combination of: (a) attachment of small particles to the

20

bed particle surfaces, (b) condensation of gaseous alkali species (KCl,
KOH, K2SO4, K) on bed particles, and (c) chemical reaction of gaseous
alkali on the surface. Secondly, accompanied by continuous depo-
sition on the bed particles, the inner layer of the coating is probably
homogenized and strengthened via sintering. Thirdly, the melting
behavior of the homogeneous silicate layer controls the adhesive
force, which is responsible for the final temperature-controlled ag-
glomeration process and defluidization.

Meanwhile, Brus et al. [64] and Grimm et al. [65] classified ag-
glomeration mechanisms into three categories according to fuel
properties: (a) bed layer formation initiated by potassium silicate
melt (formed on the bed particle surfaces by a reaction with gaseous
or liquid K compounds) accompanied by diffusion/dissolution of Ca
into the melt, viscous flow sintering, and agglomeration (behavior
typical for woody fuels containing Ca, K, and relatively low amounts
of Si); (b) direct reaction of gaseous or aerosolized K compounds
with the bed particle surface, thereby forming a low-melting
K-silicate layer with the subsequent development of a viscous flow
sintering and agglomeration (behavior typical for fuels with high
alkali and relatively low silicon content); and (c) direct adhesion
of bed particles by partly molten ash-derived potassium silicate
particles/droplets (typical for fuels with high potassium and or-
ganically bound Si in biomass, and low content of other ash-
forming elements) and K-Ca/Mg-phosphates particles/droplets
(typical for biomass rich in P, K, and Ca/Mg). Generally, the bed ma-
terial plays an active role in the agglomeration processes dominated
by mechanisms (a) and (b) but a much less obvious role in (c)
because of the limited interaction between the ash-forming com-

pounds and the bed material. For mechanism (c), the cause of
agglomeration is more dependent on the compositions of the fuel
ash [17]. These findings were further verified by Grimm et al. [65],
who studied the coating compositions of logging residues, bark,
willow, wheat straw, and corresponding mixtures by adding P-rich
fuels or phosphoric acid in a 5 kW bubbling FB by SEM-EDS and
XRD. They pointed out that for combustion of P-rich fuels and fuel
mixtures, melting is heavily dependent on the content of alkaline
earth metals in the fuel.

2.3.3. Coating forming mechanisms

Coating-induced agglomeration, which results in a uniform
coating on the surface of bed material grains, is commonly ob-
served in commercially operated FB combustors. The formation of
the coating layer is a result of an interaction between the ash-
forming elements in the fuel and the bed particles [17]. Based on
experimental data, Visser [20] proposed a coating growth model
(Fig. 16). According to experimental research, the coating can be clas-
sified as a two-layer (left illustration) or three-layer (right illustration)
model. In the two-layer model, the major components in the inner
layer are Si and Ca, and the outer layer mainly contains Ca, Si, P, K,
and S. In the three-layer model, the major elements in the inner-
most layer are Si, K, and Ca, and the intermediate layer mainly
contains Si and Ca, which have concentrations comparable to those
of the inner layer of the two-layer model. In common with the two-
layer model, the major elements in the outmost layer are Ca, Si, P,
K, and S. The coating layer consists of two or three layers depend-
ing on K. The two-layer model with a Ca-silicate layer as the inner

layer is preferable when K is not present. However, when surplus
K is present, it is more likely that a K-silicate layer will form first.
As residence time increases, K and Ca in the inner or the inner-
most layer increase, in part, because of the diffusion/dissolution of
K and Ca into the quartz grains. In the outer or outermost layer, only
K and S gradually increase with time. For thicker coating, K input
becomes faster than its diffusion, resulting in some K in the outer
layer. The presence of S in the outer coating may be attributed to
the reaction of K in the outer coating gas phase S. Excluding the in-

creases in K, Ca, and S, the changes in the concentrations of other
elements can be ignored.

Similar coating structures were reported by Nuutinen et al. [91].
They found that 1–3 superimposed coating layers exist on differ-
ent bed particles. The innermost layer is K-rich and mainly contains
alkali-silicates; the outmost layer is Ca- or Mg-rich depending on
the composition of both the fuel and bed. Coating layers that contain
potassium or sodium may be adhesive and cause the formation of
agglomerates by reaction with SiO2. Hence, quartz and natural sand

bed materials are problematic when fuel with high alkali metal
content is combusted. Owing to the magnesium-containing coating
layers on the ground blast-furnace slag granule particles, it can serve
as bed material and overcome the problems caused by the absence
of SiO2 in the bed material.

Ohman et al. [19] attempted to determine the formation mecha-
nisms for the coating and proposed that their formation is dominated
by a combination of the attachment of submicron-sized particles
and the condensation and chemical reaction of gaseous alkali-
metal species such as KCl, KOH, or K2SO4 on the bed particles
surfaces; consequently, the sintering and melting behaviors of the
homogeneous silicate layer improve agglomeration. Latva-Somppi
et al. [106] further detailed the mechanisms of reaction between
fuel-K and SiO2: (1) diffusion of vapor to the surface of the bed par-
ticle, followed by a surface reaction; (2) deposition of submicrometer-
sized K2SO4 particles on the bed material and release of sulfur from
the reaction between K2SO4 and SiO2 as SO2; and (3) deposition of
supermicron particles on the bed material followed by a reaction
between SiO2 and K that originates from the submicron particles.

2.3.4. Agglomeration indicator

Evaluation indexes as an effective tool to predict the changing
tendency of targets has been widely applied in various fields. The
most comparable evaluation indices, e.g., basic/acid ratio, Si/Al ratio,
and fouling index [107], are used with success to predict coal slagging
and fouling. They are also used for biomass slagging evaluation
[83,84]. To predict the tendency for bed agglomeration, Visser [20]
proposed three agglomeration indicators (Exp 2–Exp 4) based on
certain simplifications and hypotheses. The first indicator predicts
the formation of alkali-silicates on the bed material, the second pre-
dicts the formation of a refractory outer coating, and the third
predicts the agglomeration potential induced by an alkali-silicate
melt phase.

THEN Occuring melt-induced sintering in quartz bed.

The first agglomeration indicator, I1, reflects the probability that
an excess of alkali metals over sulfur and chloride leads to the for-
mation of alkali metal silicates. It is based on the general observation

that the initial gas phase alkali concentration can be attributable
to their concentration in the fuel, the bed temperature, and the pres-
ence of S and Cl. The latter leads to gas-phase release and binding
in relatively volatile compounds at temperature over 800 °C. This
estimation assumes that all the S and Cl present in the fuel react
with the fuel alkali species and ignore both the release of S and Cl
in the forms of HCl and SO2 and their combination with other cations.
The second agglomeration indicator, I2, describes the probabil-
ity of the formation of a refractory outer coating. This is based on
the fact that the coating build-up around SiO2 grains often devel-
ops an inner alkali-silicate reaction rim and a refractory outer rim
relatively rich in Ca, P, and Mg. The outer rim has a much higher
melting temperature, and hence, a lower potential to lead to ag-
glomeration. A fuel with a ratio in which (Ca + P + Mg) is larger than
(K + Na + Si) is believed to form such a non-sticky outer layer.

Contrary to the two indicators above involved in “coating-
induced” agglomeration, the third agglomeration indicator, I3,
indicates the probability of “melt-induced” agglomeration in a quartz
bed.

However, the successful application of the above indictors must
consider the following points. Firstly, agglomeration indicators I1
and I2 are applied consecutively because of the faster gas phase re-
action of alkali-halides and sulfates formation than the reaction of
K with Si in the bed material; however, if I1 is larger than 1.0, I2 is
considered. Secondly, the consecutive use of I1 and I2 would suggest
that the concentration of alkalis equivalent to the total concentra-
tion of (Cl+2S) would be subtracted from the total concentration
in the fuel before the ratio of I2 is calculated. The subtracted con-
centration represents the fraction being expelled to the gas phase
and unavailable for alkali-silicate formation in the bed. Third, the
ash components of the mixture are thoroughly mixed on an ele-
mental scale; therefore, elements of both fuels can be added up in
the calculation of I1 and I2.

Using agglomeration indicator I2, Piispanen et al. [18] success-
fully predicted the bed agglomeration propensity of a mixed fuel
(containing 60% peat, 20% woodchip and sawdust, and 20% forest
residue) burned in a 315 MW CFB boiler. They developed the in-
dicator I2 in a quasi-ternary diagram as (Na + K + Si)-(Mg + P + Ca)-
(Al + S + Cl + Ti + Fe). Several other quasi-ternary diagrams have been
proposed according to the coating composition and with respect
to the melting properties, such as (Si + Al)-(Ca + Fe)-(Na + Mg + K + Ti)
[91], K2O-CaO-SiO2 [92], CaO-MgO-SiO2 [93], K-Mg-P [102], and Ca-
K-P [102].

In the K2O-CaO-SiO2 ash system, increasing Ca content results
in high melting temperatures, whereas increasing K concentra-
tion moves the composition toward regions with low eutectic
temperature [92]. Fuels with low Ca/K ratio result in a high degree

23

of agglomeration. Mg-K-P and Ca-K-P phase diagrams indicate that
the ash composition close to the binary K2O-P2O5 region exhibits
eutectic temperatures as low as 590 °C, whereas an increase in either
Ca or Mg content strongly shifts the melting temperatures to over
1000 °C. Mg-K-phosphates generally have a lower melting tem-
peratures and result in a higher degree of agglomeration compared
with Ca-K-phosphates [102]. In the CaO-MgO-SiO2 ash system, no
melts are found below 1320 °C [93]; thus, no agglomeration prob-
lems should occur when both Ca and Mg content in the quartz bed
is high. Several other agglomeration indexes exist; for example, BAI
that is equal to the ratio of Fe2O3 to (K2O + Na2O). Bed agglomera-
tion occurs when the BAI value is lower than 0.15 [108]. Nevertheless,
the solution to agglomeration requires further study, especially to
investigate the most effective combinations of fuel and bed mate-
rial as well as practical and available agglomeration indicators.

2.4. Countermeasures for the main ash-related issues: additives

As mentioned previously, KOH, KCl, and K2SO4 are the domi-
nant alkali metal species generated during combustion. In particular,
KCl and K2SO4 are the primary components of the sub-micrometer
particulate matter in the flue gas produced from biomass combus-
tion [48,80]. Meanwhile, KCl and K2SO4 have low melting
temperatures of approximately 770 and 850 °C, respectively, and
binary systems containing these two potassium salts may melt at
lower temperatures of around 550 °C [63]. Therefore, as the prin-
cipal causative agents for ash-related problems during biomass
combustion, KCl and K2SO4 content must be reduced. There are
various countermeasures for this, including the use of additives
[41,109,110], co-firing [87,111], and leaching [99,112,113]. Leach-
ing removes K directly from the source, and additives and co-
firing aim to change the ash composition and further reduce the
existence of volatile alkali species [110].

2.4.1. Effects of single oxide or element additives

The inorganic content in biomass mainly comprises Si, Al, Ca, Mg,
K, Na, Fe, P, S, and Cl. Most of these elements act as nutrients and
have essential biological functions for living plants, except for Al,
which has no known biological function and is considered to have
originated from external mineral matter such as feldspars and clay
mineral. Bostrom et al. [48] simplified the classification of the main
ash-formation elements as Si, Al, Ca, Mg, K, Na, P, S, and Cl after con-
sidering the most important ash transformation reactions responsible
for ash-related problems during biomass combustion. Fe and other
elements such as Mn are excluded because they are often found in-
dividual oxides with limited interactions with the other ash-
forming elements.

As listed in Table 5, Bostrom et al. [48] further divided the ash-
forming compounds into two categories: basic and acidic. Roughly,
the compounds are arranged according to their reactivity from
highest to the lowest. Using K as an example, if P2O5(g) is con-
sumed, K will react with SO2(g)/SO3(g), and then SiO2(s) and HCl(g)
in turn. That is, K-phosphates will be the first species to form, fol-
lowed by K-sulfate, K-silicate, K-chloride, K-carbonate, and

K-hydroxide according to their thermodynamic stability [109].
However, the order is solely based on thermodynamic consider-
ations, i.e., reflecting a system at equilibrium. In a real system, further
reactions will occur and generate K-Ca- and K-Mg-phosphates and
-silicates because of the lower formation energies of these phases.
For example, along with the burnout of the fuel particle, the molten
K-silicate particles with eutectic temperatures as low as 600 °C will
aggregate, and form large droplets that initiate slagging and ag-
glomeration; then alkali earth metals may also react with or dissolve
into the melt K-silicates [48].

In addition, SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO, P2O5, K2O, and Na2O have a
statistically significant effect on silicate melt-induced slagging and
AFC. For example, Al2O3 shows a positive effect on IDT increase [67],
an increase in the Al2O3 content significantly increases AFT, which
is at its highest when the Al2O3 concentration is at its maximum
level [89].

2.4.1.1. Alkali metals: potassium and sodium. Potassium (K) is the
alkali metal present in the greatest concentration in biomass, and
its volatilization during firing is directly linked to the formation of
intransigent surface deposits, agglomeration, and corrosion. The more
alkali metals and chlorides the fuel contains, the lower its ash melting
point is and the more easily slag appears [84]. K is the root cause
of slagging, bed agglomeration, and corrosion in biomass combus-
tion and is mostly present in a soluble form. However, a small
amount exists in the form of insoluble silicate contamination of the
fuel (i.e., clay and others).

Soluble K, which can be present either in an ionic form in salts
or as directly organically bound K ions (e.g., as counterions to car-
boxylic groups), is released as K(g), KOH(g), KCl(g), and other species
during combustion and is thus readily available for further reac-
tions with other compounds of the flue gas. When no chlorine is
present in the furnace gas, the dominant vapor contains K(g),
K2CO3(g), and KOH(g). In contrast, when Cl is available, KCl(g) is the
dominant K-containing vapor. The vapor undergoes several subse-
quent reactions (described as Rs 1-15) in the flue gases depending
on the presence of other elements. Using S as an example, when
no sulfur is available, K(g) and KOH(g) may condense as a carbon-
ate aerosol (melting point: ~ 890 °C) by reaction with CO2, and KCl(g)
will condense as KCl aerosol particles or onto the existing fly ash.
The condensed KCl(s, l) becomes molten again at furnace operat-
ing temperatures (melting point: 770 °C). Moreover, KCl reduces the
first melting temperature of the fly ash, thus making the ash sticky
at low temperatures and increasing slagging. When S is present, the
alkali metal chemistry changes dramatically. According to the kinetic
model proposed by Glarborg and Marshall for the sulfation of alkali
species in combustion, SO3 reacts with KCl or KOH and transforms
into KHSO4 or KSO3Cl, which may then be converted to K2SO4 [51].
The reactions lead to Cl-free fly ash and a significant decrease in
slagging of the superheater. Several techniques, such as the addi-
tion of elemental sulfur and ammonium sulfate in a controlled
manner to the fuel or introducing them into the upper furnace, have
been developed to promote this reaction [79,111].

Alkali metals also react with silica in the residual ash and are
transformed into silicates with very low melting points (<800 °C)
[114]. Furthermore, a sticky coating is generated on the surface of
inert particles, enhancing their tendency to stick together by forming
large clusters, which leads to subsequent bed agglomeration and
defluidization. Potassium is one of the main elements in the coating
layers on bed particles as well as in the adhesive material of ag-
glomerates [30].

The authors [15] conducted the research on AFC of biomass
incinerated at temperatures from 400 to 1400 °C and found that IDT
decreases with increasing K concentration. Eldabbagh et al. [115]
conducted comparative research on particle-metal interactions
at a continuous temperature range of 1000–1400–1000 K

(Low-High-Low temperature, or LHL) and isolated 930 K (classical
FBC combustion mode). They found that in the LHL case (Fig. 17a),
the concentrations of Na + K and Ca are the highest in the region
nearest the surface, contrary to irregular distribution in the FBC par-
ticle (Fig. 17b). Meanwhile, because of high combustion temperature
in the LHL case, the surface dominated by the alkali metals is where
the bonding of the submicron particulates occurs. Na and K act as
links between supermicron and submicron particles. The continu-
ous temperatures of 1000–1400–1000 K (or the LHL case) means
that the fuel was initially fed into the low-temperature region
(<1000 K) of the pilot-scale multimode combustion facility and then
subjected to high-temperature treatment (~1400 K), followed by
quenching in the second low-temperature zone (⪡1000 K).

For the purposes of analysis, sodium in biomass can be approxi-
mated by potassium in biomass because the concentration of sodium
in biomass is generally lower than that of potassium and their func-
tions and roles in the ash transformation reactions are similar [48].
Moreover, the effect of potassium is more considerable than that
of sodium; for example, the diffusion coefficients of potassium
(53 ± 14 × 10−9 cm2/s) is approximately four times that of sodium
(2 ± 6 × 10−9 cm2/s) at 1300 °C [98]. Generally, the above descrip-
tions of potassium are valid for sodium, and sodium is treated as
simply potassium in some conditions.

2.4.1.2. Alkaline earth metals: calcium and magnesium. Alkaline earth
metals, typically calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in biomass, have
low mobility and vapor pressures and cause fewer deposition prob-
lems. Generally, as Ca and Mg content increases, the melting
temperatures increase and slagging decreases [48,99]. Alkaline earth
metals also contribute to the formation of high-temperature melting
calcium potassium phosphates and silicates [116], and thus inhibit
the occurrence of silicate melt-induced slagging and bed agglom-
eration. However, calcium sulfate deposits are frequently observed
on the surface of the cold reactor. Moreover, calcium is typically a
major constituent of the alkali silicates that form on combustion
[114].

Ca, the element present in the highest concentration in woody
biomass, can be divided into three forms: organically bound, acid-
soluble, and acid-insoluble. Generally, acid-insoluble Ca, most of
which is in the form of Ca-silicates, is inert under combustion con-
ditions and does not influence the flue gas chemistry. Organically

bound and acid-soluble Ca transfer into CaO during thermochemi-
cal conversion and exists as small micrometer-sized particles
participating in further reactions in the furnace and flue gases. On
the one hand, CaO can react with SO2 and further influence the
sulfation of alkali chlorides that worsens slagging; on the other hand,
the recarbonation of CaO may cause sintering at 600 °C to 800 °C.
Mg is chemically similar to Ca but exists at much lower con-
centrations. The combustion chemistry of Mg is less reactive than
that of Ca. Reactions that involve Ca also occur with Mg, but, in most
cases, MgO can be regarded as an inert compound during combus-
tion [117].

2.4.1.3. Phosphorus. Phosphorus (P) may be present in biomass fuels
either as soluble phosphate salts such as K3PO4 or as organic mol-
ecules containing phosphorus. In woody biomass, the ratio of
inorganic and organic P is around 3, and in several annual plants,
the organic P content may be very high (up to 0.2 wt.%) [117]. During
combustion, phosphates of both alkali metals and calcium may form.
The former may melt at low temperatures (eutectics) and cause bed
sintering or agglomeration. However, calcium phosphates do not
appear to cause sintering problems. Thus, the Ca/K ratio in the fuel
or fuel mix appears to control undesirable deposit formation when
P is present. Potassium silicates and phosphates with low Ca(Mg)/K
ratio with low melting points may result in severe ash sintering and
agglomeration during combustion [110,118]. K-rich phosphates have
melting temperatures as low as 700 °C [116]

Moreover, P dominates over Si in the competition for base cations
(K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+). Consequently, K-Mg-Ca-phosphates form prior
to the corresponding silicates [109]. The effect of P on ash-related
problems is confusing and requires further study. Grimm et al. [65]
suggested that phosphorus is the controlling element in the ash
transformation reactions during biomass combustion in fluidized
quartz beds because of the high stability of phosphate com-
pounds; however, Steenari et al. [110] pointed out that the presence
of phosphorus in biomass ash increases the risk for troublesome
ash sintering or melting behavior.

2.4.1.4. Sulfur. S is present in biomass both in the form of inorgan-
2− and organic S. Organic S is fully released during combustion
ic SO4
2− may also be released as SO2 because
as SO2, and most inorganic SO4
of the decomposition reaction of the alkali sulfates [16]. In summary,

25

most of the S in the fuels is released during combustion and ulti-
mately yields SO2. The only significant exception is CaSO4, which
may be present in some fuels.

After release, SO2 affects the alkali metals by sulfation of KCl and
KOH, as described in R 1, R 2, and R 15. Alkali sulfates are the dom-
inant alkali species that induce ash-related problems in high-
temperature zones. Both experimentation and thermo-chemical
calculations show that the transformation of SO2 into SO3 is the lim-
iting step that influences the sulfation of alkali species [78,79]. This
influence is discussed in Section 2.4.2.4).

2.4.1.5. Chlorine. Chlorine acts as a shuttle in reactions that facil-
itate the transfer of potassium in the gas phase. Alkali chlorides may
either participate in further reactions or be deposited on cold sur-
faces where chlorine may be substituted by sulfur by sulfation
reaction or by reaction with the protective oxide layer of the metal
surface, thereby initiating corrosion [114,117]. A common consen-
sus is that chloride evaporates easily and acts as a high-temperature
transport medium for potassium [70]. Generally, the higher the
amount of chlorine is, the more severe the ash-related problems
are.

Cl, most forms of which are water soluble, is present in biomass
fuels as chloride compounds that vaporize during combustion as
alkali chlorides (KCl(g) and NaCl(g)) [48]. Volatilization increases
with temperature and the Cl/Me molar ratio. At 1100 °C, Na vola-
tilizes at molar ratios (Na/Cl) ≤ 0.07, whereas K does so at a molar
ratio (K/Cl) ≤ 0.5. The effect of chlorine is therefore more signifi-
cant for K than Na [119]. Similarly, these primary Cl compounds may
undergo a number of further reactions with other ash-forming com-
pounds; for example, the metal chlorides may react with SO2 into
sulfates and release HCl.

2.4.1.6. Silicon. Si, being the major insoluble inorganic species in se-
lective leaching, is generally present as silica (SiO2) or as various
silicate minerals in the residual fraction. Under FB conditions, most
silicate remains in a crystalline form and does not cause slagging,
fusion, or corrosion because of their high melting points.

However, silica, together with potassium present in large con-
centrations, is directly linked to the formation of tenacious surface
deposits on firesides and heating surfaces [120]. SiO2-K2O eutec-
tics have melting temperatures as low as 550 °C [121]. Generally,
silicon and potassium concentrations are low in stem wood (dead
tissue) with less ash-related problems. However, their concentra-
tions are high in the bark, foliage, living tissues, and most annual
growth plant materials. Contamination from sand and/or soil (either
naturally or artificially) is preferentially present in bark, foliage, and
agricultural residues [34]. For agricultural residues such as straw,
which contain high and almost equal concentrations of Si and K that
are finely distributed throughout the fuel organic matrix, low-
melting K-silicates cause severe ash-related problems during
combustion [117]. A relatively good correlation exists between silicon
content in fuel ash and the fraction of fuel ash that forms slag con-
sisting of a large number of different particles held together by a
sticky K-silicate melt [13]. However, research indicates that ashes
with less than 47 wt.% SiO2 show significant alkali metal losses, and
ashes with high contents of SiO2 retain alkalis in the melt and crys-
talline structures [120].

Lindstrom et al. [34] conducted combustion research on five
woody biomass pellets in an underfed pellet burner (20 kW) and
reported that the slagging tendency of silicon rich forestry biomass
assortments is greater than that of the silicon poor assortments. Con-
tamination by sand and/or soil results in enhanced silicon content
in the residual ash, which promotes slagging. To reduce the risk of
slagging, there are several recommended remedies such as delimbing
or defoliation of forestry rejects, avoiding unnecessary contamina-

tion of sand and soil during harvesting, transport, and storage of
fuel, and debarking of logs prior to upgrading.

Silica and its silicates can affect the chemistry of other ash-
forming elements, especially K, Na, and Ca, through secondary
reactions and thus indirectly affect the deposition and corrosion
properties of fly ash. The most important secondary reaction is the
conversion of alkali vapors (e.g., KOH(g), KCl(g), K2SO4(g)) into cor-
responding alkali silicates.

2.4.1.7. Aluminum. Al is present in many forms in biomass fuels and
wastes. Organically bound Al or precipitated Al-salts are found in
the acid-soluble leaching fraction. During furnace processes, they
all form alumina (Al2O3), which is a solid nonreactive compound that
does not appear to participate significantly in the ash chemistry of
fluidized bed systems. In some biomass fuels, Al may be present
in the form of silicates when clay or other impurities are present;
moreover, they may react with alkali vapors, thus affecting the alkali
chemistry in flue gas. In addition, metallic aluminum, Al(s), which
may be present in certain waste-derived fuels, has a tendency to
oxidize into Al2O3 during combustion.

In summary, Al compounds are usually nonreactive compounds
that do not participate significantly in the ash chemistry of fluid-
ized bed systems. An exception is the capability of aluminosilicates
to capture alkali [117] and increase AFT [89].

2.4.2. Effects of mineral additives

The minerals in biomass can be classified into internal and ex-
traneous. Internal minerals such as whewellite (calcium oxalate
hydrate), phytolish (amorphous silica), or phytate (phosphate) are
probably significantly much more reactive in comparison with ex-
traneous minerals such as quartz, feldspars, and clays. Therefore,
several extraneous minerals such as lime, calcite, kaolin, and feld-
spars are utilized as additives and are expected to improve ash-
related problems during biomass combustion.

When blended with fuels or added into combustion systems, the
additives can (1) enhance ash melting temperatures by altering or
diluting the ash composition with refractory elements (i.e., Si, Al,
and Ca); (2) bind and convert low-melting species into less trou-
blesome compounds with high melting temperatures; and (3) reduce
concentrations of problematic ash species (i.e., KCl) in the com-
bustion system by means of physical adsorption [121].

2.4.2.1. Lime or calcite. The addition of lime (CaO and Ca(OH)2) or
calcite (CaCO3) significantly reduces slag formation during biomass
combustion [9,110,122]. For P-rich fuels such as cereal grains (barley,
rye, and wheat), the addition of lime or calcite benefits the forma-
tion of more high-melting-temperature calcium potassium
phosphates in the ash residues [122]; similarly, for Si-rich fuel such
as agro/forestry residues, the addition of lime or calcite contrib-
utes to the formation of high-melting-point calcium magnesium
silicates, which in turn reduces slagging [9].

Xiong et al. [9] conducted research on the slagging characteris-
tics of corn stover with and without added calcite and kaolin during
combustion and found that both additives can increase melting tem-
peratures by 100 °C to 200 °C. Also, calcite is more effective than
kaolin in reducing molten slagging, which decreases by two-
thirds and one-half, respectively. The corresponding morphologies
of molten slagging are shown in Fig. 18. The samples containing ad-
ditive calcite have the smallest and most fragile particles, followed
by those containing kaolin and, lastly, those with no additives. Similar
results were reported by Steenari et al. [110], and the best anti-
slagging effect is achieved when both additives (lime and kaolin)
are used; however, lime alone provides almost the same effect.

Bostrom et al. [109] conducted research on the small-scale com-
bustion of oat in a horizontal burner and reported that calcite as
an additive increases molten slagging and is accompanied by an

increasing concentration of K-sulfate and KCl in flue gas and de-
creasing concentration of both HCl and SO2. These observations are
inconsistent with the common view that calcite prevents slagging
formation. The abovementioned distinct results are more likely
caused by the different fuel properties or fuel ash compositions.
Therefore, the effect of lime or calcite on slagging requires further
comprehensive study in consideration of the variation in ash or fuel
compositions.

2.4.2.2. Kaolin. Kaolin, which mainly contains kaolinite
(Al2Si2O5(OH)4), has been identified as an efficient sorbent for the
sequestration of potassium. It decomposes at temperatures between
450 °C and 600 °C by releasing water and forming an amorphous
mixture of alumina and silica called meta-kaolinite. The meta-
kaolinite suppresses the release of potassium from the biomass and
removes gaseous potassium species by reacting with potassium com-
pounds into potassium aluminum silicates with high melting
temperatures. The binding of potassium compounds from biomass
fuels by kaolin can be described by R 34-R 42 [109,110,121].

The two main products from the above reactions, KAlSiO4
(kalsilite) and KAlSi2O6 (leucite), which have melting tempera-
tures of greater than 1600 °C and 1500 °C, respectively, and have
also been identified in biomass ash and deposits, have been widely
investigated [9,15,41,110,121]. Kaolin reduces the concentrations of
troublesome alkali chlorides and sulfates in flue gas and ashes, and
thus reduces alkali-induced slagging and coating-induced agglom-
eration; it also forms refractory alkali aluminum silicates and
eliminates both melt-induced slagging and melt-induced
agglomeration.

However, the temperature has an impact on the capacity of kaolin
to react with KCl; the amount of gaseous potassium captured by

kaolin decreases with increasing temperature [123]. Firstly, the po-
rosity of kaolin particles decreases at high temperatures, thereby
limiting the pore diffusion of gaseous alkali chlorides and sulfates
into the kaolin particles and their corresponding capturing capac-
ity [124]. Secondly, the reduction in the active surface areas of the
kaolin particles with increased temperature restricts the chemical
reaction intensity and rates between kaolin and potassium chlorides/
sulfates [123]. Thirdly, as the temperature rises above 950 °C, meta-
kaolinite dissociates into amorphous silica and alumina-silica spinel,
which transfer converts to pseudomullite at 1000 °C [123]. Both
alumina silica spinel and pseudomullite have low potential to react
with KCl in comparison with meta-kaolinite [121]. Thus, kaolin
appears to be a good choice to solve ash-related problems in CFBs
or at CFB combustion temperature. For grate and pulverize fur-
naces, the effect of kaolin requires further investigation. Although
kaolin can be utilized as an additive to solve ash-related prob-
lems, the high costs involved limit its application and require further
assessment [9].

Alternatively, the presence of a soil component in wood fuel can
be advantageous in reducing high-temperature alkali losses and may
help reduce alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration because the
admixed soil increases viscosity and the opposite effect of viscos-
ity on agglomeration. However, these possible benefits are offset by
the negative effects of soil addition, namely, reduction of the melting
temperature and increase in the probability of melt-induced slagging
formation, increased required load, and increased cost for ash-
handling facilities and ash disposal [120].

2.4.2.3. Zeolites. Zeolites, which are members of the aluminum sil-
icate family similar to kaolin, have drawn much interest for their
capacity to capture alkali during biomass combustion. One of the
most important applications of zeolites is to act as water soften-
ers to increase detergent performance during washing and
laundering. As a core component of detergents, a large amount of
detergent zeolites is carried in the wastewater and subsequently
enters the municipal sewage systems, finally being deposited in
sewage sludge after wastewater processing. Therefore, sewage sludge
is rich in zeolites, which remain as aluminum silicates and carry
various cations (i.e., Ca + and Na+) [27]. Aluminum silicates (mainly
zeolites) in sewage sludge are the main compounds that bond
gaseous KCl from the fuel and alleviate ash deposition consequent-
ly [27,73].

Wang et al. [121] studied the sintering and melting behaviors
of wheat straw and barley husk with kaolin and zeolite additions
and reported that even when heated at 1000 °C, no significant
melting is observed from the mixtures of kaolin/KCl and zeolite
24A (containing mainly (Na2O)(Al2O3)(SiO2)2·2H2O)/KCl. However,
the mixture of zeolite Y (containing mainly (12(SiO2)·(Al2O3))/KCl
sinters severely into hard aggregates and is blocked at heating

temperatures above 800 °C. The elimination of ash melting by the
addition of kaolin and zeolite 24A is attributed to the reaction with
KCl to form high-melting potassium aluminum silicates [121] such
as KAlSiO4. Zeolite Y worsens aggregates, which may be caused by
the high Si/Al ratio that decreases IDT [7,67] and improves the for-
mation of low-melting potassium silicates. Therefore, zeolite
composed of high Al/Si is favorable for the reduction of slagging and
agglomeration. However, zeolite that possesses high Si/Al re-
quires further discussion.

2.4.2.4. Sulfur. K released from fuel during combustion predomi-
nantly exists as chlorides and hydroxides. Once released, it is easily
available for chemical reaction with other components. Sulfur
reduces the formation of KCl in the flue gas by sulfation. During com-
bustion, elemental sulfur or other sulfur/sulfate-containing additives
can be utilized for the sulfation of alkali chlorides and converting
them into alkali sulfates via both homogeneous (gas phase) and het-
erogeneous (liquid or solid phase) mechanisms, which have been
proposed for the formation of alkali sulfates from alkali chlorides
identified in deposits or ash particles [79,111,125].

Fig. 19 shows the principal migration and transformation path-
ways of KCl in biomass combustion. During combustion, KCl(g), either
formed directly or from the reaction between KOH(g) and HCl(g)
(1), may be captured in the combustion chamber by means of re-
actions with ash minerals that originated either from the fuel or
additives (2), and sand particles in the CFB (3); it may also be sul-
fated (4) in the combustion chamber. The remaining KCl(g) that is
not captured/sulfated in the chamber flows into the flue gas and

may be further sulfated by SO2(g)/SO3(g) (5). Along with a reduced
flue gas temperature, KCl(g) condenses into KCl (s, l) as deposits,
which are then silicated, aluminosilicated, and sulfated by heter-
ogeneous reactions.

The presence of gaseous SO3 is of greater importance than that
of SO2 for the sulfation of gaseous KCl; this was confirmed by Kassman
et al. who used elemental sulfur (S), ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4,
and peat in their experiments [79,111]. They reported that the
sulfation of gaseous KCl is more efficient with (NH4)2SO4 even when
the S/Cl molar ratio is around half of that of elemental sulfur and
peat. For example, KCl is reduced from 30 ppm to 5 ppm at an S/Cl
molar ratio of 2.1 when using (NH4)2SO4, but only to 10 ppm at an
S/Cl molar ratio of 6.4 when using sulfur. These results can be clearly
identified from the SEM-EDX maps of the deposits in the 12MW
CFB, as shown in Fig. 20, where the lighter parts represent the pres-
ence of a specific element in the particles [79]. The deposit mainly
consists of potassium and chlorine in the reference case, and the
distribution of these elements is highly correlated (Fig. 20a). At a
low S/Cl molar ratio achieved by the addition of elemental sulfur
(Fig. 20b), the deposits consist of mainly potassium and chlorine.
However, with an increased S/Cl ratio achieved by the addition of
elemental sulfur (Fig. 20c), the deposits instead mainly consist of
potassium and sulfur, and these elements have corresponding dis-
tributions. However, the effect is incomparable with the addition
of (NH4)2SO4 (Fig. 20d), which converts KCl into K2SO4 completely.
Aside from the homogeneous sulfation reactions of KCl by SO2/
SO3, a heterogeneous sulfation reaction by ash components also
exists. The heterogeneous sulfation reaction should be valued even
though it is less significant than the homogeneous reaction. Fig. 21
shows a comparison of the results of elemental S and peat with high
S content during the sulfation of KCl. In comparison with elemen-
tal sulfur, although the addition of peat possesses lower S/Cl, it better
reduces the amount of KCl in flue gas and Cl in the deposits. Thus,
chlorine in the deposits is reduced by K-capture of ash minerals in
parallel to sulfation during co-combustion with peat.

Although (NH4)2SO4 can effectively convert KCl into K2SO4 and
therefore reduce corrosion induced by the Cl present in deposits,
it results in a higher rate of deposit formation and serious depos-
its, as shown in Fig. 22 where the deposit formation rate of biomass
with the addition of (NH4)2SO4 is significantly higher than that of
the pure biomass without any additives. Meanwhile, chlorine and
sulfur accelerate the formation of ash deposits, whereas peat as co-
firing fuel can not only reduce the Cl content of the deposits and
minimize corrosion but can also eliminate ash deposition. Materi-
al containing sulfur can be utilized as additive, but the other
protective elements (e.g., aluminum and silica), which function as
the main alkali sequestration path by the formation of alkali alumina
silicates, are more important than sulfur and its associated sulfation
reactions [126,127]. Consequently, whether the aluminum and silica
are sufficient for KCl capture or not, the effect of corrosion and
deposit should be balanced when sulfur or sulfur-containing fuels
and additives are required.

In summary, the effects of the additives on ash-related prob-
lems during biomass combustion require further investigation with
respect to the following points.

(1) To clarify the dependence or applicability of additives in
biomass species. For example, the effects of calcium dis-
cussed in the section titled “Lime or calcite” may be effective
for certain biomass, but ineffective, or even have the oppo-
site effect, for other types of biomass and conditions;
(2) To reveal the effects of temperature and other factors on re-
activity. For example, the declining K sequestration
effectiveness of kaolin discussed in the section titled “Kaolin”
is essential for the selection of additive under different com-
bustion conditions.

(3) Differences between similar additives. For example, kaolin,

“Zeolite”.

(4) Balancing the comprehensive influences on various ash-
related problems such as how to balance the effects of S on
corrosion and slagging, as discussed in the section titled
“Sulfur”. Meanwhile, synthesizing consider alkali-induced
slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), and ag-
glomeration that may occur concurrently rather than
separately.

(5) Unifying the economic and technical indicators or evalua-

tion indexes through further study.

2.5. Countermeasures for main ash-related issues: co-firing

2.5.1. Co-firing benefits and classifications

Co-firing in existing coal-fired boilers is a promising biomass uti-
lization approach and is widely used in Europe and the USA [128].
Most of the newly built coal power plants in Europe have a require-
ment of 10–20 cal% co-firing capability [129]. Biomass co-firing can

(2) Reduced emissions of NOx, SO2, and CO2 [26,42,135]. Biomass,
particularly plants with a short growth cycle, is a “neutral”
renewable energy, that is, the next generation of biomass can
effectively reabsorb the CO2 released by the combustion of
the previous generation. The ash of biomass contains large
quantities of alkali metals [15,16] such as KCl, which can
capture sulfur during combustion and reduce SO2 emis-
sions [73,136]. A high concentration of the volatile
hydrocarbon of biomass can react with NOx [137,138]. Thus,
co-firing favors lower NOx, SO2, and CO2 emissions. However,
the emission of HCl/Cl2 may be enhanced because of the high
chlorine content in biomass.

(3) Reduced fuel costs and investment [42]. Generally, biomass
purchase prices are lower than those of coal; for example, ag-
ricultural residues are usually discarded or incinerated in the
field. Thus, biomass co-firing has lower fuel costs than tra-
ditional fuels.

Currently, biomass co-firing technologies mainly involve co-
firing in FB and PC furnaces [139,140]. In comparison with the
relatively simple FB co-firing, the co-firing technologies for PC
furnaces can be classified into injection co-firing, co-milling co-
firing, pre-gasification co-firing, and parallel co-firing [139], as
shown in Fig. 23 [26]. Co-milling co-firing, which uses a single
boiler to burn biomass together with coal, is the most extensive
approach. This method entails the least investment and is favor-
able when a small proportion of biomass is co-fired. However,
mill capacity limits co-firing ratio [141]. Injection co-firing, which
also uses a single boiler to burn biomass together with coal, needs
to be coupled with dedicated biomass combustion and logistics
systems that result in large investment. However, the co-firing
ratio can be improved. Pre-gasification and parallel co-firing in-
crease biomass co-firing ratio significantly, even with 100% biomass,
but both methods require the construction of two systems (com-
bustion and gasification) and are expensive [142]. Pre-gasification
co-firing requires an extra gasifier to convert solid biomass into a
gaseous fuel, which is then burned together with the coal in the
boiler. Parallel co-firing employs a separate boiler for biomass
combustion, and the steam generated from the biomass-fired
boiler is then mixed with steam from the coal-fired boiler. Thus,
currently, both co-milling co-firing and injection co-firing are the
most widely used.

the combustion of biomass by addition of S from different sources (adapted from
reference 111).

not only eliminate or reduce various ash-related issues that inev-
itably occur in dedicated biomass-fired furnaces [6,129–132], but
can also utilize and exploit renewable energy. Moreover, co-firing
has the following advantages:

(1) Increased boiler efficiency [5,26,42]. The equivalent coal con-
sumption of co-firing in large PC furnaces (~330 g/kWh with
a modest co-firing ratio) is basically half of that in dedi-
cated biomass firing furnaces (for example, ~ 630 g/kWh in
grate furnace) with a thermal efficiency of approximately 50%
[133]. According to the assessment of National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL, DOE, U.S.) [134], the power gen-
eration efficiency of biomass co-firing remains either
unchanged or slightly decreases, and their efficiency can be
maintained at 33%–37% even with an elevated co-firing ratio
of 15 cal %. Therefore, co-firing can utilize the high boiler ef-
ficiency of large PC furnaces.

erence 111).

2.5.2. Co-firing in CFB

Fluidized bed combustion technology has been successfully dem-
onstrated at a large scale. Also, it has been shown to meet the
technical requirements necessary for the co-firing processes because
of its inherent advantages over conventional systems, e.g., simple
design, fuel flexibility, high efficiency, and low pollutant emission
[5]. The relatively low and uniform temperature and the good mixing
of bed material disfavor slagging; however, bed agglomeration easily
occurs [135].

Fig. 24 shows a typical commercial CFB boiler built at Chalmers
University of Technology; it has been widely utilized to study the
effects of additives and co-firing on deposits [27,111]. Kassman et al.
[111] conducted research on gaseous KCl and chlorine in deposits
by means of IACM (on-line measurements of gaseous KCl), deposit
probe measurements, and ash analysis in the co-firing testing of peat

and a mixture of wood and straw pellets. They reported that the
chlorine content of the deposits is reduced remarkably because of
the capture of potassium by the reactive components of peat ash
(Al, Fe, Ca, and Si) and the sulfation of KCl during co-combustion.
Elled et al. [27] further pointed out that the formation of alkali chlo-
rides in the flue gas and deposits can be controlled by the addition
of municipal sewage sludge. Despite the fact that the fuel is highly
contaminated with chlorine, it can be used because of the relative-
ly high content of sulfur and other reactive ash components (Si, Al,
Ca, Fe, and P) in the sludge. Similarly, Nordin [135] conducted re-
search on co-combustion of high sulfur coal and lucerne in a 5 kW
pilot-scale CFB and found that agglomeration, which occurred when
lucerne was burned alone because of the formation of K-rich sili-
cates from the bed and ash particles and K from the grass, did not
occur. Among the reactive ash components, Ca presents the highest

effectiveness in anti-slagging. This finding was confirmed by Wang
et al. [87], who studied the effects of sewage sludge mainly con-
taining Si, Al, Ca, P, and Fe and marble sludge composed of 95.12
wt.% CaO and 2.99 wt.% MgO on the slagging characteristics during
combustion of wood waste pellets in a 1.2 MWth STEPFIRE boiler.
When 4% and 8% of marble sludge was added, only 1.5% and 2.5%
of the ingoing ash formed slagging. The addition of 4 wt.% of sewage
sludge reduced the slagging formation fraction from 34% to 26%, but
increased it to 38wt.% with 8% addition fraction. Meanwhile, in com-
parison with sewage sludge, the slagging was fragile and could be
pressed into power using fingers after the addition of marble sludge.
The aforementioned research indicated that co-firing in CFB can
reduce slagging and agglomeration. However, the degree of de-
crease is highly dependent on the co-firing fuel and the co-firing
ratio.

2.5.3. Co-milling co-firing in PC furnace

As illustrated in Fig. 23, in co-milling co-firing where coal and
biomass blends are co-milled in the existing coal mills, biomass is
blended with the coal either on-site or off-site. Therefore, addi-
tional dedicated biomass mills are not required. In the UK, all power
stations that perform biomass co-milling co-firing employ on-site
blending to satisfy Ofgem’s audit requirements [142].

Fig. 25 shows an on-site fuel blending system utilized in co-
milling co-firing technology. Conventionally, coal is transferred by
a belt conveyor and biomass is discharged into the coal evenly and

from reference 143).

continuously by a blanking hopper. The mixture is then trans-
ported into the coal mills for pulverization. This is the preferred
approach in many stations embarking on co-firing for the first time
because it requires only minimal retrofitting and low investment
for the boiler system. Basically, a biomass co-firing ratio up to 5–10
cal% is permitted; at higher co-firing ratios, the capability of the coal
mills to co-mill biomass becomes the barrier [143].

Savolainen [130] implemented co-milling co-firing testing with
varied sawdust/coal ratios in a 315 MW PC furnace. The results
showed that co-firing does not cause slagging and can reduce SO2
emissions. However, when the co-firing ratio is increased to 2.5 cal%,
milling deteriorates and results in increased unburned carbon in
fly ash and decreased boiler efficiency. Fortunately, with torrefied
biomass or bio-char, the co-firing ratio can be increased [143].

2.5.4. Injection co-firing in PC furnace

As illustrated in Fig. 23, injection co-firing involves a com-
pletely separate feed line for the biomass fuel with separate handling,
drying, milling, and burners/injectors. Although this is more ex-
pensive to install, it allows for greater flexibility in handling and
processing biomass, with a low potential for adversely affecting the
primary coal stream. The milling properties of biomass are typi-
cally different from those of coal. Biomass also has a significantly
greater content of volatile matter (around 80%) than coal (45% for
bituminous coals and 10% for anthracite). Separate handling streams
for biomass and coal can allow co-firing to occur in plants with strict
limits on the volatile content of fuels used [144].

As shown in Fig. 26, existing injection co-firing modes were clas-
sified into four basic modes by Livingston [143]; all injection co-

Fig. 27. Proposed co-firing mode of agricultural/forestry residues and coal (reprinted from reference 26, with permission of MDPI).

firing systems involve the pneumatic conveying of the pre-milled
biomass from the fuel reception and handling facility to the boiler
chamber. The processes are as follows: 1) direct injection of pre-
milled biomass into the pulverized coal pipework, 2) direct injection
of pre-milled biomass into modified coal burners, 3) direct injec-
tion of the pre-milled biomass through dedicated biomass burners,
and 4) injection of the pre-milled biomass directly into the furnace.
Biomass has a high moisture and fibers content, which is unfa-
vorable for milling; as a result, the mill, pipework, and burners may
become blocked. Furthermore, the high volatility and low ignition
temperature negatively affect the operation of the unadapted coal
mill. In addition, without a burner, i.e., without an air supply system
for the biomass, the biomass cannot ignite timely and burn com-
pletely. Therefore, considering the cumbersome maintenance and
low investment of co-milling co-firing and the high co-firing ratio
of injection co-firing, a new co-firing mode was proposed and dem-
onstrated in a previous study [26].

As illustrated in Fig. 27, the proposed co-firing mode is more de-
pendent on injection co-firing combined with co-milling co-
firing. Firstly, various agricultural/forestry residues are collected and
pretreated by a crusher and a molding machine; Secondly, the crush
and pellet mixtures are transported to power plants; Thirdly, blends
of coal and the pellet/shred of agricultural/forestry residues are in-
jected into a specific burner system (top or bottom burner system)
after co-milling, and the other burner systems are fed with pure coal.
The agricultural/forestry residues are injected into only one burner
system similar to injection co-firing and are mixed and co-milled
with coal before injection similar to co-milling co-firing. Hence, the
co-firing mode is a combination of injection co-firing and co-
milling co-firing. In an injection co-firing furnace, pure biomass is
injected into the specific burner system after milling, whereas in
a co-milling co-firing furnace, biomass and coal mixture are in-
jected into each burner system after co-milling. The advantages of
this new proposed co-firing mode are as follows.

(1) Compared with dedicated biomass firing, the proposed co-
firing mode entails lower investment with immediate benefits,
lower pollution emissions, lower coal consumption, and higher
boiler efficiency. The proposed co-firing mode also elimi-
nates slagging and reduces the dependence on seasonal
biomass, such as that on the agricultural/forestry residues.
(2) Unlike injection co-firing, there is no need to construct a spe-

cific logistics system; hence, saving is made.

(3) Compared with co-milling co-firing, agricultural/forestry resi-
dues are only injected into one burner system rather than into
all burner systems; this condition reduces the shutdown prob-
ability caused by the blockage of the mills, which results from
the uneasy milling property of agricultural/forestry residues.
(4) Co-firing by the top or bottom burner system provides in-
creased boiler efficiency in comparison with dedicated PC
combustion. Generally, several layers of burner systems exist
in boiler units. Thus, the injection location of the biomass,
which influences the boiler efficiency and polluting emis-
sions, make plant operator more difficult [143]. The authors
[26] conducted co-firing testing based on the proposed co-
firing mode in a 300 MW PC furnace that contains six layers
of burner from bottom to top; detailed description are avail-
able in reference 138. The results showed that the boiler
efficiency of co-firing is 0.05% to 0.31% higher than that of
dedicated PC combustion when the co-firing ratio is below
5 wt.%. The boiler efficiencies are approximately 0.2% higher
with agricultural/forestry residue co-firing in the bottom and
top burner systems than that in the middle burner system;
however, a high co-firing ratio (>10 wt.%) results in reduced
boiler efficiency [145]. These results were partly confirmed
by Wang et al. [138], who also performed co-firing testing in
the same units and found that boiler efficiency decreases by
between 0.19% and 0.52% with a co-firing ratio from 9.68 wt.%
(6.53 cal%) to 22.7 wt.% (16.1 cal%). Hughes and Tillman [145]
also reported that the boiler efficiency decreases slightly with
a co-firing ratio of 9.7 wt.% to 13.5 wt.% in Plant Hammond,
Georgia, USA. Notably, a low biomass co-firing ratio (<5 wt.%)
increases boiler efficiency, particularly the biomass injected
into the bottom and top burner systems. By contrast, a high
biomass co-firing ratio decreases boiler efficiency.

However, research on ash-related issues conducted in large PC
furnaces is scarce and requires more practical demonstrations, par-
ticularly concerning the co-firing ratio.

2.6. Countermeasures for main ash-related issues: leaching

Although the inherent chlorine and alkali species extracted from
soil during growth are notorious for ash-related issues during
biomass combustion, the Cl and alkali content of certain grasses
and straws can be reduced by using Cl-free fertilizers [146] and

Y. Niu et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 52 (2016) 1–61

33

restricting the use of inorganic fertilizers such as potassium fertil-
ization, which may have undesirable consequences for crop yield
and farm revenue [113]. Simple screening can also remove unde-
sirable components such as adventitious soil that is added during
harvesting and handling processes that contributes to fouling and
slagging [32,113]. Also, leaves with higher alkali content than the
trunk and larger branches can be removed [112]. However, most
undesirable constituents are inherent to the biomass and dis-
persed throughout the entire fuel. Thus, power plant operators
currently rely on the selection of fuel that contains low amounts
of ash, chlorine, and alkali metals; consequently, many fuels that
may be available at lower cost are excluded [113].

Leaching is an effective pretreatment strategy to remove inher-
ent inorganic species, particularly alkalis, sulfur, and chlorine in
biomass to mitigate ash-related issues [14,33,147]. During com-
bustion, alkali metals are relatively volatile; they form hydroxides,
chlorides, and sulfates, which produce molten salt mixtures on ac-
cessible surfaces, and result in slagging and fouling. Chlorine is a
facilitator of alkali evaporation. It leads to the condensation of alkali
chlorides on heating surfaces in the boiler and promotes corro-
sion of these surfaces [99]. Leaching can remove these key ions and
reduce the formation of their corresponding salts.

The inorganic species in biomass can be classified into three cat-
egories [31,148]: water-soluble portion (i.e., salts readily soluble in
water, including alkali chlorides, sulfates, carbonates, and alkali earth
chlorides), dilute-acid leachable portion (i.e., organically bound in-
organic species and minerals that are water-insoluble but acid
soluble, including alkali earth carbonates, sulfates, and sulfides), and
residual (other acid insoluble minerals, including silicates and el-
ements that are bound to the organic matrix with a covalent bond).
According to the above categories, leaching strategies can also be
classified into water, acetate, and acid leaching. Approximately 100%
of Cl and 90% of alkali metals are water soluble; thus, much atten-
tion has been devoted to water leaching [99,112,113].

Compared with natural water leaching (rain and snow) that is
weather dependent, technical leaching can address the problems
of the unpredictability of weather and rainfall-induced biomass
losses. Overall, it constitutes a more reliable measure of quality op-
timization of biomass; nevertheless, leaching by natural precipitation
remains an alternative [14,113,147].

2.6.1. Technical water leaching (batch leaching)

When water leaching is mentioned, most people will recall batch
leaching. In batch leaching, the targeted materials are immersed in
a water container under controlled conditions, and the targeted ma-
terials not only come into contact with the leaching solution but
are also in continuous contact with the leachate.

Vamvuka and Zografos [99] reported that batch water leaching
can result in a significant reduction in ash (up to 40%) and prob-
lematic elements such as K (up to 93%), Na (up to 96%), P (up to
85%), and Cl (up to 97%); it can also improve fusibility behavior [83].
Both Dayton et al. [113] and Bakker et al. [149] reported similar
results. Dayton et al. [113] conducted batch water leaching experi-
ments on rice straw, wheat straw, switchgrass, mixed wood fuel,
bana grass, and sugarcane bagasse, and reported that K was de-
pleted by an average of 82%, Cl by an average of 95%, both Na and
S by an average of over 50%, and P by an average of 43%. As a result,
the alkali index decreased by 81%. Bakker et al. [149] conducted re-
search on untreated and leached rich straw as well as untreated and
leached rice straw blended with commercial wood fuel in a lab-
scale FB combustor. They discovered that K, Cl, P, and S in leached
straw ash are significantly lower than that in untreated straw. The
combustion of unblended leached straw was stable and without ag-
glomeration, whereas the combustion of untreated rice straw under
similar conditions resulted in extensive bed agglomeration, rapid
bed defluidization, and unstable combustion temperatures. The com-

bustion of a wood-based fuel blend containing 25% untreated rice
straw also resulted in rapid bed agglomeration, whereas the com-
bustion of similar fuel blends containing leached rice straw did not
result in any difficulties in controlling combustion temperatures and
bed fluidization. Ash deposition on the heat exchanger declined when
25% leached rice straw was blended into the commercial wood fuel
relative to firing commercial wood fuel along with no leached straw.
Thus, ash-related problems originating from high Cl and alkali
metals in biomass, including bed agglomeration, slagging, and cor-
rosion, can be mitigated by batch water leaching [113,147].

2.6.2. Technical semi-continuous leaching

Although batch leaching has been widely applied because of its
simple operation, it over-leaches the water-soluble inorganic species
because of the extensive and lengthy contact between the acidic
leachate and biomass sample [148,150,151].

Liaw and Wu [148] revealed that under conventional batch leach-
ing conditions, the leachate is acidic because of the extraction of
several organic acids from the biomass sample such as acetate,
formate, and oxalate; the cation/anion ratios (Na + K+2Mg+2Ca)/
(Cl+2S+3P) of the leachate are 2.5 and 3.3 for wood and leaf,
respectively. This suggests that at least some of the alkali and al-
kaline earth metals leached from the biomass samples do not exist
in the biomass samples as water-soluble salts. Therefore, under batch
water leaching conditions, the organic acids leached from biomass
samples remain in the leachate system. Some of the acid soluble
(but water-insoluble) alkali and alkaline earth metals are leached
because of the extensive and lengthy contact between the acidic
leachate and the biomass sample. Conventional batch water washing
of biomass overestimates the contents of water-soluble inorganic
species in biomass samples. Similar reports were presented by Wu
et al. in another reference [150] and also by Ho et al. [151].

Aiming to eliminate the overestimation of the contents of water-
soluble inorganic species in biomass samples through conventional
batch water leaching, Liaw and Wu [148] proposed the semi-
continuous leaching method. Unlike in a batch leaching reactor
where various amounts of water-insoluble inorganic species (but
soluble in the acidic leachates) are leached out because of the ex-
tensive and lengthy contact between the acidic leachate and the
biomass sample, the leaching products in semi-continuous leach-
ing method are rapidly separated from the biomass particles. The
process ensures that it is the fresh water (rather than the acidic lea-
chate) that continues to perform the leaching action in the biomass
sample.

Fig. 28 shows a comparison of batch leaching and semi-
continuous leaching; it clearly shows that batch leaching over-
leaches alkali and alkaline earth species. Furthermore, Fig. 29 shows
a comparison of the various inorganic species leached by the con-
tinuous leaching process (water leaching + dilute acid leaching (HCl/
H2SO4)) of mallee wood under batch and semi-continuous leaching.
All of the alkali and alkaline earth species over-leached by batch
water leaching are acid soluble, and the leachate of batch water
leaching contains some acid. The majority of Na and K com-
pounds are water-soluble, but a large proportion of Mg and Ca
compounds are only acid soluble. The water insoluble but acid-
leachable Mg and Ca might bond with the organic structure of the
biomass and become leachable through ion exchange with hydro-
gen ions from the diluted acid or form water insoluble salt such as
calcium/magnesium oxalate and/or calcium/magnesium carbon-
ate [148].

The effects of water and acid leaching on straw ash compo-
nents and structures are illustrated in Fig. 30. Comprehensive analysis
of the ash components and structures shows that unleached straw
ash is coated with molten material (mainly alkali silicates) with a
high concentration of alkali and alkaline earth metals. Water leach-
ing can reduce the concentration of K and Na in the ash.

Fig. 28. Percentages of various inorganic species leached from water washing of mallee wood under batch and semi-continuous leaching conditions (adapted from refer-
ence 148).

Consequently, the formation of low-melting alkali silicates is reduced.
With increased acid concentration, K and Na contents in the ash and
the outmost molten material of the ash particle are reduced [152].
Compared with the internal part of the ash particle (point b), the
external part of the ash particle (point a) contains fewer alkali and
alkaline species because of sufficient contact with the leaching solute.

Although semi-continuous leaching is more precise in quanti-
fying the water-soluble concentration of alkali and alkaline earth
species, conventional batch leaching is a better choice in industri-
al applications because of its simple operation and water
conservation. Moreover, the ion-exchangeable alkali and alkaline
earth species that are partially over-leached out during batch

leaching are also responsible for slagging, agglomeration, and cor-
rosion. Therefore, extraction can mitigate ash-related issues.

2.6.3. Natural water leaching by rain and snow

Although technical leaching can extract Cl, S, alkali, and alka-
line earth metals in biomass and further reduce slagging, bed
agglomeration, and corrosion [113,147], batch leaching and semi-
continuous leaching require the consumption of large quantities of
water and energy and entail the need to construct a leaching field.
Natural leaching can overcome these problems.

The reduction in unwanted elements by leaching from rainfall
has been recommended as a post-harvest quality optimization
process even though leaching by natural precipitation is highly de-
pendent on suitable weather conditions [147]. High precipitation
during a short period is an ideal condition; for example, thunder-
storms during warm weather periods. However, natural leaching is
dependent on the weather, and no certainty exists as to whether
suitable weather will occur at the right time in any given year. Mean-
while, natural precipitation during the field period always results
in biomass losses such as leaf loss [147].

Compared with technical leaching strategies, leaching by natural
precipitation is more weather dependent and reduces unwanted el-
ements less; however, it has some advantages that technical leaching
lacks, such as lower costs, little or no need for additional energy
input, and independence from external facilities [147]. Although
natural precipitation always results in leaf losses, incorporating the
leaf back into the soil benefits the recycling of key inorganic nu-
trients [148]. It can also reduce the content of high-risk alkali species
in the entire woody biomass and further alleviate ash-related prob-
lems because the leaf has a higher alkali content than the other parts
of the plant [112]. Therefore, reducing the concentrations of Cl, S,
and alkali metals in biomass by rain and snow during the field drying
period should be encouraged as an option in bio-fuel quality op-
timization [33,113,147].

2.6.4. Effect of leaching intensity: amount of water and/or time

In batch leaching, semi-continuous leaching, and natural leach-
ing, the amount of water or leaching time has significant effects on
the removal on Cl, S, alkali metals, etc. For example, Smith and Brown
[153] reported that, for the same quantity of water, low leaching
efficiency is more associated with a water application rate of
40 mm h−1 than with 20 mm h−1. By simulating natural rain leach-
ing by means of a lawn sprinkler and plastic lined with fine mesh,
Tonn et al. [147] revealed that the concentrations of Cl, S, K, and
ash in dry herbage decrease with increased duration of simulated
rain.

Fig. 31 shows the changes in Cl, K, and ash concentrations in
grassland garbage under three leaching methods: simulated rain (i.e.,
natural rain leaching), high-intensity irrigation (i.e., approximate
semi-continuous leaching), and laboratory batch leaching. With in-
creased amount of water application during simulated rain and high-
intensity irrigation leaching and increased duration of leaching time
during laboratory batch leaching, the concentrations of Cl, K, and
ash decrease, i.e., the leaching efficiency, increase. For batch leach-
ing, the extraction of Cl, K, and ash occurs mainly at the initial stage
and prolonging the duration of leaching has a slight effect. For both
simulated rain and high-intensity irrigation, the leaching efficien-
cies increase with either increased amount of water application or
leaching time. In theory, a critical point exists after which the con-
centrations of Cl, K, and ash will change only slightly, even though
both the amount of water application and leaching time increase
continuously.

Similar results were reported by B. Tonn et al. in another paper
[33]. Fig. 32 shows the effects of initial contents of K (Fig. 32a) and
Cl (Fig. 32b) on leaching efficiencies for different leaching times. As
shown in the figure, for both Cl and K, the leaching efficiencies in-
crease with time. The elemental contents before and after leaching
show a strong linear relationship; that is, for the same leaching time,
the greater is the initial content, the greater is the residual content.

(min)

Furthermore, Tonn et al. [147] determined the relationship
between the amount of water required by simulated rain and that
required by high-intensity irrigation on the leaching efficiencies for
Cl, K, and ash, as shown in Fig. 33. A close linear relationship exists
between the effects of simulated rain and high-intensity irriga-
tion on the concentrations of Cl and K. For K, the slope is close to
1.0, indicating that in spite of the large difference in water appli-
cation rates, the change in K concentration per mm of water applied
is nearly identical. In the case of Cl, the leaching efficiency per mil-
limeter of water is low at a high water application rates. For ash,
the leaching efficiency per mm of water is very high at a high water
application rate. These different relationships may be attributed to
the synthetic effects of diffusion and the mechanical processes [147].
If the diffusion of leachable components from the interior of the
biomass particle to the surface plays a considerable role, the dif-
fusion time may be the limiting factor in the leaching process at
high rates of water application. Alternatively, mechanical pro-
cesses such as the washing-off of surface dust or the movement of
water through the plant cell walls may also affect the leaching
process. If mechanical processes are dominant, then high leaching

efficiencies will be obtained at a high rate of water application. High
rates tend to be associated with large raindrop sizes and veloci-
ties, similar to batch leaching (complete immersion), and the
mechanical action imposed by the shaker in laboratory leaching.
Therefore, diffusion processes appear to play a dominant role for
Cl; ash is more dependent on mechanical processes, and both dif-
fusion and mechanical processes influence K.

These comprehensive analyses indicate that, for industrial ap-
plications, batch leaching is a better choice than semi-continuous
leaching because of its easy operation and extra extraction of acid-
soluble alkali and alkaline earth metals, especially alkali metals that
are responsible for intractable ash-related problems. In contrast to
batch leaching, which overestimates the water-soluble inorganic
species because of the extensive and lengthy contact between the
acidic leachate and the biomass sample, and thus, leads to the extra
extraction of water-insoluble (acid-soluble) ions, semi-continuous
leaching, which can exactly extract water-soluble alkali and alka-
line species, is more suitable for experimental determination. To
eliminate the problematical chlorine, alkali, and alkaline earth
species, natural leaching is a more economical technology, but

mission of Elsevier).

considerable attention must be paid to the harvest season [33]. In
addition, the leaching effect presents a certain dependence on
biomass species; for example, leaching can prevent the formation
of deposits and agglomerates of olive residues burned in bubbling
FBs, whereas the effect on Danish wheat straw is minimal [114].

In sum, in either technical leaching or natural leaching, leach-
ing intensity (including the amount of leaching water, leaching
duration or time, water application rate, and others) should be con-
sidered. For low-ash biomass, such as stem wood, the diffusion of
leachable components from the interior of the biomass particle to

the surface plays an important role, and long leaching duration and
low water application rate are preferable. For high-ash biomass, such
as bark and straw that are easily contaminated by clay and dust,
strong leaching (high water application rate and big liquid parti-
cle size) should be applied.

3. Part II. Corrosion

3.1. Corrosion mechanisms

During combustion, the flue gas containing Cl2(g), HCl(g),
NaCl(aerosol), KCl(aerosol), and others species may cause direct cor-
rosion by accelerating the oxidation of the metal alloys. It may also
influence the corrosion caused by other mechanisms such as the
corrosion of superheater tubes by molten alkali salts. Alkali chlo-
rides deposited on superheater tubes are well known to cause
corrosion in boilers burning biofuels and waste, and they are also
the main factor that limits the final steam temperature, and con-
sequently, the efficiency of biofuel and waste boilers [117,154]. A
detailed classification and discussion of corrosion mechanisms based
on its various possible origins are provided below.

3.1.1. Corrosion associated with Cl2
3.1.1.1. Oxidation atmosphere. In oxidation atmosphere, metal grad-
ually oxidizes and forms a smooth and dense oxide scale adjacent
to the metal. The oxide scale provides a barrier for further diffu-
sion of oxygen and most other gaseous species to the metal and,
as a result, oxidation corrosion is limited. Regular oxidation corro-
sion of metal presents a parabolic trend [155]. However, chlorine
can penetrate the protective oxide layer through the pores and cracks
and reacts with the metal alloys to form metal chlorides at the scale-
metal surface via R 43 [156,157].

where M represents Fe, Cr, and Ni. At the scale-metal surface,

thermodynamically stable because of the very low concentration
of oxygen (O2 is consumed to produce the metal oxide scale, which
hinders the inward diffusion of oxygen). However, metal chlorides
have high vapor pressures at the metal-scale interface, and con-
tinuous evaporation takes place via R 44.

The volatile metal chlorides diffuse outward to the scale surface,
and oxygen concentration increases with increasing distance from
the metal surface, leading to the oxidation of the volatile metal chlo-
rides to solid metal oxides by R 45 and R 46 [156,157].

The resulting oxides form a very loose metal oxide layer that pro-
vides no protection against further attack [157]. Through R 45 and
R 46, the released chlorine diffuses either to the bulk gas or back
to the metal surface; thus, a cycle that, with little net consump-
tion of chlorine, provides a continuous transport of metals away from
the metal surface toward regions with higher oxygen partial pres-
sure is formed [22,156]. The net result is that the metals are oxidized
into oxides according to R 47 [22].

The above process is called active oxidation corrosion
[21,22,156–158], as shown in Fig. 34. The process can be summa-
rized in five steps [47,159]: a) release of Cl-containing compounds;
b) transport of Cl2 through the scale; c) chlorination of iron, chro-
mium, etc.; d) volatilization of MCl2 (outward transport to the inner
oxide layer and to the outer oxide layer) accompanied by the crack-
ing of the oxide layer; and e) oxidation of the metal chlorides and
release of chlorine.

Although there are arguments about the corrosion rate (i.e.,
whether it depends on the outward diffusion of volatile metal chlo-
rides through the porous scale or inward diffusion of Cl2), the
common belief is that active oxidation begins with little incuba-
tion time after chlorine is introduced [160]. More attention should
be paid to the effects of temperature [154,156,157,161], atmo-
sphere [157,162], potassium compounds present [157,163], alloying
elements including concentrations [21,23,159] and species (such as
Cr, Ni, Si and Al) [23,155,159,162,164], and the formation mecha-
nisms on the layered corrosion structure [23,156,161].

Ma et al. [23] studied the high-temperature corrosion of pure
Fe, Cr, and Fe-Cr binary alloys in O2 containing trace KCl vapor at

750 °C and the detailed formation process of the multilayer oxide
structure (shown in Fig. 35a). In the initial corrosion stage, Cr2O3
is formed prior to oxidation, and an enriched zone of Fe is formed
near the surface of the substrate. In the presence of KCl vapor, Cr2O3
reacts with KCl and releases Cl2, which induces active oxidation. Cl2
diffuses inward and reacts with the substrate, and the reaction prod-
ucts, FeCl2 and CrCl2, diffuse outward. In addition, FeCl2 is prone to
form because of the enrichment of Fe near the substrate; then FeCl2
diffuses outward through the Cr2O3 layer because of high vapor pres-
sure and is further oxidized on the Cr2O3 surface (as shown by the
arrow in Fig. 35b(a)). During active oxidation, the formation of chlo-
rides and the transformation from chloride to oxide result not only
in the detachment of scales from the substrate but also in the for-
mation of a pore structure in the scales. O2 and Cl2 penetrate into
and react with the substrate, an internal layer of Cr2O3 is formed
and Fe-enriched zone near the surface generated again (Fig. 35b(b)).
The above corrosion process is a cycle, and multilayer oxide scales
are generated (Fig. 35b(c)).

3.1.1.2. Reducing atmosphere. In a reducing atmosphere where oxygen
is absent or insufficient, metal chlorides form directly on the metal
surface through R 43. Therefore, the volatilization of metal chlo-
ride, which is strongly dependent on temperature, governs the rate
of corrosion [22]. The entire process (illustrated in Fig. 36) can also
be divided into five steps [47]: a) release of Cl-containing com-
pounds; b) transport of Cl2 through the scale; c) chlorination of iron,
chromium, etc.; d) volatilization of MCl2 (outward transport to the
inner oxide layer and to the outer oxide layer) accompanied by the
cracking of the oxide layer; and e) escape of chlorides from scales
by evaporation.

In a reducing atmosphere, metal chlorides may evaporate straight
into the atmosphere and result in the depletion of chlorine, which
may be recycled back into the scale in an oxidizing atmosphere. In
molten corrosion, along with the depletion of chlorine, the corro-
sion process slows with time. The first melting temperature of the
deposit increases as the chloride content of the deposit decreases
[47]. Even though some H2S may exist under a reducing atmo-
sphere and a corrosive environment can be created by sulfate
deposits, corrosion is much slower than that in the presence of
chloride-containing melt [47].

3.1.2. Corrosion associated with gaseous alkali chlorides

To inhibit high-temperature corrosion, various alloying materi-
als, such as chromium, have been added in Fe- and Ni-based alloys.
Metallic chromium forms protective oxide layers that mainly contain
Cr2O3, which can prevent chlorine corrosion effectively. However,

Once the chromium oxide and chromium are transformed into
potassium chromate, the protectiveness of the oxide scale is de-
stroyed, and iron oxides grow rapidly. However, the corrosion

associated with gaseous alkali chlorides is highly dependent on the
supply rate of gaseous alkali chlorides, which depends on the dis-
tance from the sample surface to the salt source at constant
temperature [164].

The chlorine released by R 48–R 51 can further react with the
alloy to form iron, nickel, and chromium chlorides and accelerate
corrosion through the mechanism described in Section II.1.1.

3.1.3. Corrosion associated with solid/deposited alkali chlorides

Biomass combustion is associated with severe slagging contain-
ing high concentrations of alkali chlorides and sulfates. The innermost
layer of deposits is generally composed of KCl and K2SO4 [6]. The
presence of KCl and K2SO4 in the deposit can cause a very high cor-
rosion rate, even at temperatures below the melting point of pure

salts. Concerning these two species, KCl is more worthy of concern.
Also, NaCl has a similar corrosive behavior to KCl [46].

High partial pressures of chlorinated species generated in the
deposit close to the metal surface can lead to a corrosion mecha-
nism similar to the gaseous phase corrosion attack described in
Section II.1.2. The potential reactions are listed below:

The reaction products, (K, Na)2CrO4 and (K, Na)FeO2, have been
observed in corrosion testing. Compared with (K, Na)FeO2, (K,
Na)2CrO4 is more stable and can exist in the presence of higher Cl
content. When a much high partial pressure of Cl is obtained from
R 52 and R 53, R 54 and R 55 move to the left side where iron oxide
coexists with chloride salt [164].

Several other reactions corresponding to the transformation of

Both R 56 and R 57 are much faster than R 52 and R 53 [46]. In
short, R 52–R 57, which generate Cl2, indirectly induce the corro-
sion described in Section II.1.1.

3.1.4. Corrosion associated with sulfation/silication of alkali
chlorides

As discussed in Section I.1.1, alkali chlorides can be trans-
formed into silicates and alumina-silicates through silication ( R 58)
and alumina-silication ( R 59), respectively, and they are also easily
sulfated in the presence of SO2 ( R 60). HCl generated through R 58–R
60 is responsible for corrosion. Even in the absence of water vapor,
alkali chlorides can also be sulfated by the release of Cl2 ( R 61)
instead of HCl.

Some metal chlorides diffuse out through the deposit to

The Cl2 and HCl released by the reactions can also diffuse toward
the metal surface again. Thus, the net reaction leads to the contin-
uous transport of metal from the metal-scale interface to high
oxygen-scale in the bulk gas. After sulfation or silication, the cor-
rosion mechanisms are similar to those described in Section II.1.1
for gas-phase Cl attack.

3.1.5. Corrosion associated with molten alkali chlorides

Pure NaCl, KCl and K2SO4 have melting points of 801, 774, and
1069 °C, respectively. However, together they can form low-
temperature eutectics. Using NaCl/KCl and KCl/K2SO4 as examples,
NaCl-KCl and KCl-K2SO4 can melt at temperatures as low as 657 °C
[46,165] and 694 °C [22], respectively. Fig. 37 shows the binary phase
melting diagrams for NaCl-KCl [165] and KCl-K2SO4 [22] eutectic mix-
tures. The melting trend line has a “V” shape with reduced KCl
concentration in the binary systems. The eutectic temperature can
be as low as 657 °C and 694 °C for the NaCl-KCl and KCl-K2SO4 mix-
tures, respectively.

Table 6 shows the melting points and eutectic temperatures of
compounds and mixtures that probably exist during the corrosion
processes that occur during biomass combustion. When the metal
surface temperature becomes sufficiently high for molten phases
to form in the deposit, corrosion may increase [22]. The molten
phase increases the corrosion rate by three methods: 1) molten
deposits may form a flux with the protective oxide layer [47], 2)
chemical reactions may be faster than solid-solid reactions in the
liquid phase [21,46,47], and 3) a liquid phase provides an electro-
lyte or a pathway for ionic charge transfer for electrochemical
attack [22,47].

Aside from the high solvencies and diffusivities of oxygen and
chlorine in the molten phase which accelerate the corrosion kinet-
ics [21,46], the corrosion mechanisms that occur in the molten phase
should be similar with those presented for solid/deposited alkali
chlorides described in Section II.1.3.

However, Li et al. [46] studied the corrosion behavior of various
model alloys with NaCl-KCl coatings at 670 °C in air and found that
a breakdown of the protective oxide readily occurs by dissolution
into the melt; the degradation rate can be especially fast if the oxide
has a high solubility. The corrosion resistance is reduced as the Cr
component dissolves in the molten chlorides under an oxidizing at-
mosphere. Cr2O3, which is corrosion resistant in other cases, acts
as chromate in NaCl-KCl melt. The corresponding reactions contain
Rs 64–66.

R 67

As indicated by R 64–R 67, a self-sustaining corrosion process
exists in the molten system without alkali chloride consumption.
Meanwhile, the high reactivity of Cr2O3 in the molten alkali chlo-
rides makes the protective chromic scale disappear or become more
porous, which further deteriorates corrosion [164].

3.1.6. Corrosion associated with molten alkali sulfates

The most common form of accelerated corrosion in super-
heater tubes in a coal-fired conventional boiler is caused by the
presence of molten alkali-metal-trisulfates. In a biomass-fired
furnace, deposits with a white layer rich in alkali sulfates are widely
reported. The deposited alkali sulfates cause corrosion by reacting
with SO2 and iron oxide to form liquid alkali-iron-trisulfate (R 68
and R 69).

Below 550 °C, the ash deposit is a porous layer that allows
relatively free gas diffusion between the tube surface and the bulk
flue gas; the corrosion rate increases with increasing tempera-
ture, which improves gas diffusion [166]. However, the corrosion
rate, which is highest when the deposit forms a molten layer of
alkali-metal-trisulfates next to the tube surface, decreases along
with a further increase in temperature because of the disappear-
ance of pores.

During biomass combustion, the presence of chloride acceler-
ates the corrosion of molten alkali sulfates. Firstly, chlorides may
cause the breakdown of the normally protective scale, through which
SO2 and SO3 cannot diffuse. Once the protective scale is destroyed,
SO2 and SO3 can penetrate the oxide layer through the ruptures in
the scale and result in further corrosion. Secondly, the presence of
chlorides in alkali sulfate can form eutectics and decrease the melting
temperature of the salt mixture, thus accelerating corrosion. Fig. 38
shows the effects of the coating of NaCl-Na2SO4 on steel corrosion.
The Na2SO4 coating on the steel surface exacerbates corrosion, and
the corrosion rate significantly increases even when as little as 1
wt.% NaCl is blended into Na2SO4.

Generally, corrosion in molten salts can be characterized in two
steps: oxidation of the metal and basic or acidic dissolution of oxide
scales. For oxidation, oxygen provided by dissolution from the gas
phase or by dissolution of oxygen-bearing molecules in the molten
salt has to diffuse through the melt layer to the metal surface. The
corrosive oxygen species in molten sulfates are formed by the dis-
sociation of the sulfate ion in the melt.

A concentration gradient of O2- and dissolved species is estab-
lished during the corrosion process. As the concentration of O2-
decreases throughout the melt, the solubility of dissolved species
decreases and precipitation occurs [167]. Therefore, a gradient of
2- and a solubility gradient exist for dissolved species in the melt,
O2
and basic fluxing becomes possible, as illustrated in Fig. 39. As a
result, the dissolved species re-precipitate in regions with a low con-
centration of O2- and a high concentration of O2, and voluminous
and porous scales are formed.

The re-precipitation of oxide according to R 75 leads to the sup-
pression of SO3 evaporation from the melt. The high-solubility SO3
in the sulfate melt dissolves by chemical reaction with the melt as
a pyrosulfate.

3.1.7. Corrosion associated with molten alkali carbonates

Compared with sulfate melts, the chemistry of carbonate melts,
and therefore, their corrosion mechanisms, are quite different. The
formation of O2 by the decomposition of the carbonate ion, given
by equilibrium reactions R 78-R R 80, is unlikely because of the highly
positive values of the Gibbs free energy for R 79 (being 198–224 kJ/
mol in the temperature range of 400–700 °C). The Gibbs free energy
for R 71 is lower than 35 kJ/mol in the same temperature range.

This reaction produces oxide ions; therefore, basic dissolution
of oxide scales can occur according to R 86. Compared with the melt/
gas interface, a higher concentration of O2- ions is established at the
oxide/melt phase boundary. Therefore, a solubility gradient of the
dissolved species exists throughout the melt, and basic fluxing might
be possible as observed in sulfate melts. The reaction sequence,
taking place by oxidation (via O2

2- ions), is shown in Fig. 40.

The dissolution of oxide scales may also occur by peroxide ions

in carbonate melts according to R 87.

in Fig. 41. The figure shows a schematic of the basic dissolution of
2- ions responsible for cor-
metal in carbonate melts initiated by O2
rosion caused by molten alkali carbonates. In this case, no fluxing
of oxide occurs because no solubility gradient is established in the
2-
melt [167]. If the corrosion product is soluble (as in the case of CrO4
from Cr2O3), the melt will be saturated with chromate without pre-
cipitation of Cr2O3. If it is insoluble, stable layers of corrosion products
will be formed.

3.2. Corrosion countermeasures or influence factors

3.2.1. Alloying and salts

High-quality alloys are recommended to prevent or reduce cor-
rosion. Alloyed chromium is known to improve steel by forming a
protective oxide layer consisting of either a corundum-type solid
solution or, if the chromium content of the steel is sufficiently high,
even pure Cr2O3.

Ma et al. [23] studied the high-temperature corrosion of pure
Fe, Cr, and Fe-Cr binary alloys in O2 containing trace KCl vapor at
750 °C and reported that the corrosion rate of Fe-Cr alloys is reduced
as the concentration of Cr increases (shown in Fig. 42). Mean-
while, a multilayer oxide scale consisting of an outer Fe2O3 layer and
an inner Cr2O3 layer is formed. The corresponding corrosion mecha-
nisms associated with gaseous KCl are clearly described in Section
II.1.2. In the presence of KCl vapor, the Cr and/or formed Cr2O3 will
react with KCl and release Cl2. The released Cl2 induces active ox-
idation and forms cracks and pores oxide scale. When the protective
Cr2O3 layer is destroyed, further corrosion of the metal substrate is

accelerated by the reaction of O2 and Cl2 that have penetrated into
the metal.

Li et al. [46,164] conducted research on gaseous and solid KCl
and eutectic KCl/NaCl concerning the corrosion of Cr, Si, and Al modi-
fied Fe- and Ni-based alloys, as shown in Fig. 43. Eutectic KCl/NaCl
can be regarded as molten or liquid KCl because of the equally cor-
rosive behavior of the individual KCl and NaCl components that has
been observed in various Fe-Cr, Fe-Al, and NiAl model alloys, ferrite,
austenite, AISI347, and Sanicro 28 [46,154]. Fig. 43 shows that the
corrosion strength of KCl (and also applicable to NaCl) is in the order
molten state > solid state > gaseous state. This result may be attrib-
uted to the different corrosion mechanisms or coexisting multi-
corrosion mechanisms between molten and solid KCl and the
substance. For example, the breakdown of protective oxide layer
occurs by dissolution into the melt, the corrosion rate is fast if the
oxide is highly soluble in the melt, and the breakdown facilitates
oxide activation [46]. Otherwise, both low melting K2Cr2O7 and eu-
tectic KCl-K2CrO4 that are attributed to the reaction between Cr2O3
and solid KCl can also induce local molten corrosion and acceler-
ate it [46]. However, this phenomenon remains unclear and requires
further investigation.

Fig. 43 also indicates that the alloying element Si has the best
corrosion resistance followed by Al and Ni. For corrosion associ-
ated with gaseous KCl, high chromium content presents good
resistance because of the low partial pressure of oxidation, which
allows the formation of a protective Cr2O3 layer near the sub-
strate. For corrosion associated with both molten and solid KCl,
higher chromium content has a detrimental effect because of the
high dissolution of Cr2O3 in the molten salts [46]. Alloying with alu-
minum facilitates the formation of a dense aluminum chromium
oxide mixture, which restricts further corrosion at the initial stage;
however, the chromium from the surface layer is gradually con-
verted into potassium chromate and eventually overgrown by a
porous iron oxide. Addition of Si provides a protective support by
forming a continuous inner layer of silica that effectively pre-
cludes the active oxidation of iron [164].

Lehmusto et al. [157,163] systematically studied the effect of KCl
and K2CO3 deposits on the corrosion of 10CrMo, 304L, and alloy 625
at 500, 550, and 600 °C, as shown in Fig. 44. The corresponding com-
positions of the three alloys are listed in Table 7, according to
references 21,22,162. The presence of potassium induces initial ac-
celerated oxidation, whereas, the presence of chloride or chlorine

is essential for it to continue based on the average corrosion layer
thickness shown in Fig. 44 and the structure presented in the paper.
The oxides formed in the presence of K2CO3 are more homoge-
neous with well-adhered thin layers, whereas the oxides formed
in the presence of KCl are multilayered with poorly adhering layers.
The formation mechanisms are explained in Fig. 35. Similar results
(corrosion is initiated with potassium and potassium chromate as
the intermediate, and the presence of chlorides and chlorine is es-
sential for it to continue) have also been reported elsewhere
[161,162]. As shown in Fig. 44, temperature also plays a key role in
the corrosion process. Corrosion accelerates with increasing tem-
perature, which improves the diffusion of the gas reactants (Cl2 and
O2) and gaseous reaction products (KCl and CrCl2). Meanwhile, a high
chromium content inhibits corrosion. Generally, the corrosion be-
havior of an alloy depends on the relation between chromium loss

by evaporation and the supply of chromium to the oxide by diffu-
sion into the alloy [162]. If chromium loss is rapid in comparison
with chromium diffusion, the protective scale becomes severely de-
pleted in chromium, resulting in rapid oxidation, for example, in
10CrMo. By contrast, alloy 625 shows good corrosion resistance. Fe-
based alloys with low Cr exhibit rapid corrosion, but highly alloyed
steel such as austenitic stainless steel or Ni-based alloys have good
resistance to corrosion [159]. 18Cr-8Ni stainless steel is bordering
regarding the formation of protective oxide scales [21]. Aside from
the use of Cr as an alloying element, Si [164], Al [46,164,169], and
Co [155,170] give high corrosion resistance when used as the coating
or alloying element.

Low-alloy Fe-based steels suffer from severe corrosion in Cl-
containing environments because the partial pressure of iron chloride
is high at elevated temperature (ΔG = −238 kJ/mol, 550 °C). Ni-
based alloys are more resistant than steels because the partial
pressure of nickel chloride (1.3 × 10−5, 550 °C) is significantly lower
than the partial pressure of iron chlorides (2.1 × 10−4, 550 °C), and
the Gibbs energy change of NiCl2 (ΔG = −181 kJ/mol, 550 °C) for-
mation is less negative than that of FeCl2 (ΔG = −238 kJ/mol, 550 °C)
formation [47]. For CrCl2, the partial pressure and Gibbs energy
change are 2.0 × 10−7 and −292 kJ/mol, respectively [47]. The data
above support the conclusion that the corroded oxide scale is

46

Y. Niu et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 52 (2016) 1–61

composed of an outermost iron oxide layer followed by an oxide
layer containing chromium, iron, and nickel, and then a nickel-
rich region before the bulk metal [163].

Therefore, during the combustion of biomass with high alkali
chlorides and sulfates that induce various corrosions, the corro-
sion caused by molten alkali chlorides is the most severe and should
be avoided first, followed by the corrosion caused by solid/deposited
alkali chlorides and gaseous alkali chlorides. For gaseous corro-
sion, a high Cr content inhibits the process by forming a protective
Cr2O3 oxide layer because of the higher amount of Cr supply than
the amount of Cr loss by evaporation. For molten and solid/
deposit corrosion, a high Cr content accelerates corrosion. Therefore,
other alloying elements such as Si, Al, and Co, which possess high
corrosion resistance, should be investigated. Meanwhile, more at-
tention should be focused on the effects of heavy metals, particularly
Zn and Pb. These two metals may form the low-melting-point com-
pounds ZnCl2 and PbCl2, which accelerate the corrosion reactions
[161].

3.2.2. Atmosphere and temperature

Accompanying the combustion of biomass, H2O, SO2, Cl2, and HCl
as reactant gases enter the flue gas and influence the corrosion re-
actions listed in Section II.1. A study has reported that 0.1 wt.%
chlorine in biomass corresponds to approximately 100 ppmv chlo-
rine in the gas phase; commonly, biomass contains around/more
than 1 wt.% chlorine [22]. The effects of HCl and Cl2 on corrosion
have been investigated extensively and are believed to be essen-
tial for continued corrosion and the formation of a multilayer
structure [157,161–163].

Mayer and Manolescu [171] investigated the effect of HCl on the
morphology of the protective oxide layer. Without HCl in the syn-
thetic flue gas, a continuous, nonporous scale is formed. At 0.1 vol%
HCl, although some blisters occur in the Fe2O3 layer, the scale is still
continuous. At 0.2 vol% HCl, the layer becomes porous and non-
continuous. At 0.8 vol% HCl, the Fe2O3 layer becomes completely
disintegrated, and the Fe3O4 layer becomes irregular and porous. At
2 vol% HCl, the continuity of all the layers is destroyed, and the cor-
rosive gases have free access to the FeO layer and Fe. HCl and Cl2
can be mutually transformed in oxygen and water vapor atmo-
spheres (R 91), and metal oxides acting as catalysts improve the
generation of Cl2 [22,156].

For H2O, when the concentration is above 1 ppm, R 89 becomes
more probable. At a temperature above 400 °C, water vapor is known
to destroy the protective chromium oxide layer even when no other
corrosion compounds are present [172]. This condition is due to the
formation of Cr(VI) oxide hydroxide vapor (R 92), which converts
the protective chromium oxide-rich surface into a poorly protec-
tive Fe-rich oxide [162,163].

Fig. 45 shows a comparison of the corrosion results of humid O2
and dry O2. H2O significantly deteriorates the corrosion of low alloy
steels such as 304L, whereas the effect on high alloy steels such as
Sanicro 28, is minimal [162].

Lehmusto et al. [157,163] investigated the effects of water vapor
on the corrosion of 10CrMo, 304L, and alloy 625 covered with KCl
or K2CO3 at 500, 550, and 600 °C. Without potassium salts, H2O de-
teriorates the corrosion of low alloy steels because of the formation
of Cr(VI) oxide hydroxide vapor, which converts the protective chro-
mium oxide-rich surface into a poorly protective Fe-rich oxide.
However, for high alloy steels such as alloy 625, the effect is un-
identified. The different effects can be attributed to the competitive
relationship between chromium loss by evaporation and supply of

O2 and O2 + H2O (reprinted from reference 162, with permission of Elsevier).

chromium to the oxide by diffusion in the alloy [162]. For low alloy
steels such as 10CrMo, chromium supply from the substrate fail its
evaporation as Cr(VI) oxide hydroxide vapor, thus H2O accelerates
corrosion, whereas for high alloy steels such as alloy 625 because
of the high chromium content in the substrate, chromium diffu-
sion from the substrate is far greater than the evaporation; thus,
corrosion is inhibited.

However, when the steel surfaces are covered with potassium
salts, the effect of H2O becomes more complicated. For KCl, H2O de-
creases corrosion in two possible ways: (1) in the presence of H2O,
a denser oxide layer might form; and 2) water vapor might inhibit
the reaction between the steel and the salt [157]. For K2CO3, the op-
posite trend is observed. Therefore, the effect of H2O on corrosion
requires further discussion.

The effects of temperature on the corrosion behavior of 10CrMo,
304L, and Alloy625 in dry and wet conditions are illustrated in Fig. 46.
With or without coating (K2CO3 and KCl), temperature, which ac-
celerates corrosion, has a significant effect. Generally, high
temperature means a large amount of corrosion. Grabke et al. [160]
studied the corrosion behavior of Cr-Mo steel at different tempera-
tures by adding NaCl, as shown in Fig. 47. Below 450 °C, the effect
of temperature is slight; with increased temperature up to 550–
600 °C, the corrosion rate presents a parabolic shape with time, and
becomes nearly linear at 650 °C. This result may be due to the dif-
ferent corrosion mechanisms or corrosion kinetics, which both
require further study.

4. Part III. Ash utilization

With the rapid development of biomass combustion power gen-
eration, the large volume of ash by-product has become an
intractable problem throughout the world. According to statistics,
the worldwide annual output of biomass ash, which is compara-
ble to that of coal ash with an annual production of 780 million tons,
is approximately 476 million tons [173]. Therefore, an eco-friendly
and economic solution to recycle this by-product is essential.

According to the statistics provided by the American Coal Ash
Association (ACAA) from 2000 to 2012 (Fig. 48) [174], the utiliza-
tion rates of the three major by-products of coal combustion, namely,
fly ash (average annual production of 67.6 Mt), bottom ash (average
annual production of 17.6 Mt), and boiler slag (average annual pro-
duction of 2.1 Mt) range from 32% to 45%, 29% to 48%, and 61% to
83%, respectively. Approximately 70%–84% of fly ash are used in
construction, including concrete and concrete products, blended

cement/raw feed for clinker, flowable fill, structure fill/embankments,
and road base/sub-base. Less than 1% is used in agriculture and soil
modification and stabilization. Approximately 48%–75% of bottom
ash is used in construction materials, less than 6% is used in agri-
culture and soil modification and stabilization, and 17%–30% is used
for snow and ice control. For boiler slag, 81%–98% are used as blast-
ing grit/roofing granules. These different utilization approaches are
mainly related to the respective properties of the three by-products.
For example, fly ash and bottom ash have high pozzolanic activity,
durability, and abrasion resistance, which allow them to be uti-
lized as cement and concrete replacements. Meanwhile, bottom ash
is coarse and porous and can thus be used as a filler. Boiler slag has
a low density, so it is widely utilized as roofing granules.

Similar reports were presented by the European Coal Combus-
tion Products Association e.V (ECOBA) as shown in Fig. 49 [175]. In
2003, 2004, 2006, and 2010, the utilization rates of fly ash (average
annual production of 40.4 Mt), bottom ash (average annual pro-
duction of 5.5 Mt), and boiler slag (average annual production of
1.7 Mt) in the EU-15 countries ranged from 44% to 50%, 39% to 51%,
and 100%, respectively. The by-products were also mainly used as
construction materials and in soil improvement/stabilization. In
several countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Italy, and Denmark) with a
fly ash production of approximately 2 Mt/y, fly ash is recycled com-
pletely. In France (3 Mt/y), Canada (6 Mt/y), Australia (10 Mt/y), the
UK (15 Mt/y), and Germany (40 Mt/y), fly ash utilization rates range
between 50% and 85%. In India (112 Mt/y), China (100 Mt/y), and
the USA (75 Mt/y), which are the top three countries in terms of

lightweight concrete applications; however, it has less durability than
conventional aggregates [199].

Many studies on ash as a constituent of cement or construc-
tion materials [177–194] and on its use in agriculture/forest
fertilization and improvement [176,178,195–197] have been con-
ducted. However, most studies focused on coal ash rather than
biomass ash. Research on biomass ash utilization is scarce.

4.1. Physico-chemical properties of biomass ash

Ash produced during biomass combustion mainly consists of fly
ash and bottom ash. With reference to the definitions of fly ash [198]
and bottom ash [199] during the process of coal combustion, biomass
fly ash (BFA) is a fine, powdery substance that “flies up” from the
biomass combustion chamber (boiler) and is captured by emis-
sion controls such as electrostatic precipitator, fabric filters
“baghouses”, and scrubbers [177]. Biomass bottom ash (BBA) com-
prises angular, porous, agglomerated ash particles formed in biomass
furnaces that are too large to be carried with the flue gases and
impinge on the furnace walls or fall through open grates to an ash
hopper at the bottom of the furnace [177]. In the USA, more than
half of the concrete produced today uses coal fly ash at a propor-
tion of 40%–70% as a substitute for traditional cement. Bridges,
skyscrapers, roads, dams, massive walls, girders, and foundations
are built by using high-performance fly ash concrete mixes to achieve
superior strength and longevity [198]. Coal bottom ash can be uti-
lized as a replacement for aggregates, because it is sufficiently well-
graded in size and avoids the need for blending with other fine
aggregates to meet gradation requirements. Its porous surface struc-
ture makes it lighter than conventional aggregates and useful in

BFAs are also employed as raw materials in the cement and brick
industry in Austria and the Netherlands, as construction materials
for landfill in Sweden, and for grouting mines or as asphalt or con-
crete fillers in several other countries. BBAs, or mixtures of bottom
and coarse fly ashes from clean biomass fuels, are commonly uti-
lized as fertilizer on agricultural or forest soils in Finland and Sweden,
as an additive for compost production in Austria, and as a liming
agent for forest soils in Austria and Germany [25]. However, the prop-
erties of biomass ash are diverse because of the variety of biomass
fuel sources [15,177,185,186,200]. For example, agricultural resi-
dues and bark generate a high ash content (5% to 10% and even up
to 30% to 40%), whereas woody biomass generates low ash content
(typically less than 2%) [201,202]. The properties of biomass ash also
vary depending on the soil type where the biomass was grown
[12,200], harvesting seasons [200], combustion technologies
[177,185] (fixed beds that burn particles with a size of 1–10 cm typ-
ically have a combustion temperature of 1000–1200 °C [186,201,203],
FBs that burn particles with a size of 10−2–1 cm typically have a com-
bustion temperature of 800–900 °C [186,201,203], and PC furnaces
that burn particles with a size of 10−4–10−2 cm typically have a com-
bustion temperature above 1200 °C [138,203]), and collection
location [201]. Thus, no single application is suitable for all types
of ash [202].

Ash utilization as a raw material in cement manufacture is pri-
marily dependent on its chemical composition [200], as expressed
in the usual oxide convention in Table 8. Similar to coal ash, the
chemical composition of biomass ash exhibits certain similarities
to those of cement and soil, such as its oxide content, loss on

ignition (LOI), particle density, water-holding capacity, and poros-
ity. These similarities ensure that it can be used as a substitute or
used as an additive for cement and as a soil ameliorant. Physical
properties (such as LOI, bulk density, water-holding capacity, po-
rosity, specific surface area (SSA), pH, trace and heavy element
content, etc.) further dictate special applications, including use as
a cement additive/replacement and use in soil/forestry stabilization/
fertilization. Heavy metal content such as As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn,
V, B, and Hg are severely restricted. Table 9 shows a summary of
the heavy metal concentration limits for the utilization of biomass
ash as a soil conditioner in forests and agriculture. As shown in the
table, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Lithuania, Germany, and Finland
have strict standards.

4.2. Utilization for construction materials

4.2.1. Relative standard on ash utilization in cement

According to a report by KEMA [25], shown in Table 10, most fly
ash and bottom ash from wood firing or low co-firing ratios (up to
20 wt.%) can be utilized as a cement/concrete component. For EN
450-1:2005 + A1:2007 [224], 10% of fly ash, derived from biomass/
coal co-firing with a ratio up to 20 wt.%, is currently used as additive
for cement provided that it fulfills the above requirements. Addi-
tionally, fly ash from biomass/coal co-firing is also used as concrete
or asphalt filler [25]. However, several existing standards exclude
the use of BFA in cement. For example, ASTM C-618 explicitly states
that the fly ash used in the concrete industry must be completely
derived from coal [181,184]; EN 197-1 [225] and BS 12 [226] state
that fly ash should be obtained by electrostatic or mechanical pre-
cipitation of dust-like particles from the flue gases of furnaces fired
with pulverized coal, and the ash obtained by other methods cannot
be used in cement. Although the revised EN 450-1:2012 permits

a

it

lists

requirements,

less than 30% of ash derived from co-combustion material with a
high co-firing ratio of 40% (for green wood, up to 50%) to be used
in cement,
including
set of
SiO2 + Al2O3 + Fe2O3 ≥ 70%; reactive SiO2 ≥ 25%; reactive CaO ≤ 10%;
MgO ≤ 4%; total alkalis ≤ 5%; SO3 ≤ 3%; Cl- ≤ 0.1%; soundness ≤ 10 mm;
LOI equal or less than 5, 7, and 9 for categories A, B, and C, respec-
tively; and an initial setting lower than twice that for the test cement
alone [227,228]. In addition, EN 450-1 defines that fly ash has to
be derived from the burning of pulverized coal with or without a
co-combustion material [224,227]. This means that the ash from a
dedicated boiler where the finely ground fuel is burned above
1300 °C can be used, whereas ash from grate furnaces and fluid-
ized bed boilers cannot be used.

Ash as a blended cement component shares some of the
requirements of both raw materials and direct concrete admix-
ture use. However, given that little or no adjustment can be
provided at the concrete mixing stage, its utilization in blended
cements must involve consistent and uniform chemical and phys-
ical characteristics [200]. Table 11 provides a summary of the
main Portland cement standards, which provide useful guidelines
for ash selection and pretreatment. For example, Cl-, alkalis, and
unburned carbon (which are higher in biomass ash than in coal
ash and seriously compromise the durability of the cement-based
material) can be removed [177,185,201] or partially replaced
[177] before use. According to the standards of EN 197-1:2000
[225], GB175-2007 [230], and JIS R 5210-1997 [231], the content
of SO3 should be equal to or lower than 4.0, 3.5, and 3.0, respec-
tively; the content of Cl- should be equal to or lower than 0.1, 0.06,
and 0.02, respectively; the equivalent alkalis should be lower than
or within the range of 0.60–0.75; and the LOI should not exceed
5.0 (EN 197-1:2000), 3.0 (GB175-2007), and 2.5 (ASTM C150-07).
For more standard limits, refer to Table 11.

4.2.2. BFA

Many types of BFA such as those from wood [177,181], olive
residue [182], rice husk [232], and sugar cane straw [233] have
similar pozzolanic properties as coal fly ash and have been added
in concrete to improve performance. Aside from the economic fea-
sibility, fly ash use has a number of other positive effects on the
resulting concrete when used as an additive to Portland cement. Such
positive effects include improved pumpability, reduced water
demand and water/cement ratio, low heat evolution, strong and
stable protection cover to the embedded steel framework against
natural weathering action, increased corrosion and abrasion resis-
tance, improvement in the packing of particles, and reduced air
entrainment in the concrete [200]. However, reduced air entrain-
ment adversely affects the initial freeze and the durability of the
concrete. However, if the fly ash concrete is allowed to cure fully,
the effects would be minimal, and the concrete mix will perform
satisfactorily [200]. Generally, biomass ashes contain high quanti-
ties of alkali and alkaline earth metals. Soluble alkali metal salts (KCl
and K2SO4) in ash cause the precipitation of gypsum and portlandite
during the first hydration stages of the pastes and consequently
enhance their apparent viscosity. CaO and MgO present in ash could
potentially improve the 28d strength, provided that the silica content
in the ashes is higher than that in the cement [184]. In contrast, a
high alkali content in biomass ash can cause a serious alkali silica
reaction (ASR) and expansion of the cement [181], and the alkali
reaction coupled with a progressive dissolution of K salts present
in the starting ashes causes a long term decline in the material’s
mechanical behavior [184]. In addition, high LOI or unburned carbon
leads to an unstable air content and decreased binding properties
when used in construction, leading to poor durability if not dealt
with properly [181,191,202].

Wang et al. [181] conducted durability research on BFA con-
crete, where the fly ash includes co-fired fly ash from biomass/
coal co-firing, wood fly ash, and blended fly ash (wood fly ash mixing
with coal fly ash). Freezing and thawing tests showed that all types
of fly ash concrete have a statistically equal or lower weight loss

than pure cement concrete. Furthermore, all types of fly ash con-
crete have lower chloride permeability. Cuenca et al. [182] studied
the effect of olive residue BFA as a filler in self-compacting con-
crete and pointed out that BFA concrete has a compressive strength
that is equal to or greater than that of conventional concrete.

Maschio et al. [184] systematically studied the compressive
strength of mortar pastes obtained by replacing a commercial cement
with the equivalent mass of 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt.% of BFA or BBA
from fir chips combustion (Fig. 50). They observed that the mate-
rials containing 5 wt.% ash (used as the reference composition) have
acceptable compression strength after 28 days; however, a pro-
gressive increase in ash causes a continuous decline in material
strength because of increased water adsorption. Moreover, the
samples tested after 180 days display a marked decline in com-
pressive strength because of potassium elution and alkali silica
reaction during curing. Rajamma et al. [201] characterized cement-
based materials, where cement is replaced by BFA from a grate
furnace and a bubbling fluidized bed at proportions of 10, 20, and
30 wt.%. They found that the basic strengths (both flexural and com-
pressive) maintained with 10% fly ash decrease by 25% at 20%
replacement ratio. Fernandez-Pereira et al. [179] also pointed out
that the addition of 20% BFA to a clay mixture reduces strength, but
the material can be used commercially as low-density clay masonry
units with good thermal insulating capacity. Therefore, the maximum
amount of ash that can be used to replace cement is approximate-
ly 5–10 wt.%; large quantities do not lead to good physico-mechnical
behaviors.

4.2.3. BBA

Carrasco et al. [177] evaluated the potential of bottom ash from
a biomass plant (mixture of olive pomace and agricultural residue)
as a mass replacement in proportions ranging from 10% to 90% for
cement in building blocks. They reported that the addition of BBA
increases the material’s porosity and consequentially decreases its
thermal conductivity and compressive strength, as shown in Fig. 51.
Meanwhile, with a 1:1 Si/Ca ratio, both the compressive strength

(61.11 MPa) and thermal conductivity (0.773 W m−1 K−1) are accept-
able and can potentially be utilized in products, such as blocks.
Cabrera et al. [180] reported that BBA, as stated in the Spanish tech-
nical specification PG-3 that assesses the potential of using BBA in
construction materials, has acceptable properties to be used as a
filler material in road embankments and that, by reducing the level
of organic matter, can be used in a wider range of civil infrastruc-
tures projects. However, if BBA contains high amounts of organic
matter, Hinojosa et al. [185] suggested that it should not be used
in building materials because the high chloride content from the
organic matter is disadvantageous for the manufacture of rein-
forced concrete. However, it can be utilized in bulk concrete at a
defined percentage of replacement. Rajamma et al. [201] agreed with
Hinojosa et al.’s suggestion and pointed out that the presence of
chlorides and sulfates in cement materials can reduce durability by
causing deterioration of the microstructure.

4.2.4. Biomass/coal co-fired ash

Wang et al. [181] conducted durability research on BFA con-
crete, where the fly ash includes co-fired fly ash from biomass/
coal co-firing and blended fly ash (wood fly ash mixing with coal
fly ash). They reported that all types of fly ash concrete have a sta-
tistically equal or less weight loss and lower chloride permeability
than pure cement concrete. Biomass/coal co-fired ash normally does

not noticeably alter the bulk cement chemistry, and the produced
materials have equal or even better performance (strength, alkali
silica reaction, durability, deformation, and permeability) than that
of coal ashes [178].

In our previous research [26], we found that the cement char-
acteristics of the fly ash produced by agricultural/forestry residue
co-firing in a PC furnace are more dependent on the primary fuel
coal; a modest co-firing ratio (<20 wt.%) does not affect the fly ash
used for cement alternative significantly. The detailed results are
presented in Table 12. With or without co-firing, the condensa-
tion starting/ending times, expansion and water demand ratio satisfy
GB/T1596-2005, although compressive and flexural strengths, as well
as the activity index, are lower than the indicators of GB/T1596-
2005. Notably, the compressive and flexural strengths and activity
index of the fly ash of co-firing (approximately 6% decline) are com-
parable with the corresponding parameters of the fly ash of coal,
and other researchers have presented similar results [138], where
co-firing also resulted in decreased compressive and flexural
strengths and activity index even though the testing results satisfy
GB/T1596-2005; compressive strength and activity index de-
creased by 5%–6% with co-firing ratio of 9.68 wt.% and 22.7 wt.%.
Given that coal ash as a replacement for cement can improve
durability [186,187,194], strength [191,192], abrasion resistance [189],
heat evolution [188] and shrinkage [190], we believe that biomass

4.3. Utilization in agriculture and other fields

Soil acidification is aggravated by the extensive use of nitrogen
fertilizers. Lime has been widely utilized as an effect approach to
neutralize or optimize the soil pH value to 6.5–7.0, a value that
is preferred by most crops and maximizes the availability of most
nutrients to plants [176,196]. However, its application contributes
to global warming because, as the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) assumes, all carbon in agricultural lime is
finally released as CO2 to the atmosphere [197]. Therefore, the
use of fly ash as an effective substituent for lime in soil improve-
ment has been recommended to reduce net CO2 emission
and global warning [197,234]. Fly ash used as a soil ameliorant
brings not only economic benefits but also environmental and
ecological benefits compared with conventional disposal,
which leads to the degradation of arable land and contamination
of ground water [195]. Moreover, the use of fly ash as a soil
ameliorant significant promotes the growth and yield of plants
[196,235–240] because of the high concentration or increased
availability of nutritional elements (K, Na, Zn, Ca, Mg, Fe, etc.)
[176,197].

As summarized in Table 13, which shows the application of fly
ash to improve problematic soil systems, the effects of FA on soil
(shown below) are extensive.

(1) Optimization of the pH value. FA as a substitute for lime can
be utilized to buffer the soil pH between 6.5 and 7.0 [176,234],
which is essential to plant growth. At very low pH, i.e., acidic
soil, Mn and Al are toxic to plants because of their dissolu-
tion and resultant bioavailability [176].

(2) Alteration of soil texture. Soil and FA mixtures tend to have
lower bulk density, higher porosity, higher water-holding ca-
pacity, and lower hydraulic conductivity than soil alone
[197,220,222,241,242].

(3) Biota improvement. FA can activate microorganisms in acidic
soil [243] and improve enzymatic activity such as invertase,
amylase, dehydrogenase, and protease [244].

(4) Accommodation of plant nutrients. FA in soil can improve the
availability of sulfate, carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, P, K,
Ca, Mg, Mn, etc. [222,240] but decrease the amount of Ni, C,
Pb, etc. [222].

(5) Stabilization/immobilization of heavy metal. For heavy metal-
contaminated soil, FA addition can inhibit the transport of
contaminants into deeper soil layers and into groundwater
by metal immobilization [176] and alkalizing effects, which
are more significant in acidic soils [245].

(6) Reduction in global warming. FA is a feasible alternative to
lime for treating acidic soil, and lime brings additional CO2
emission [197,234]. And so on.

Although FA has numerous benefits for soil amendment and crop
growth, almost all studies are related to coal FA. Research on BFA
is scarce, and extensive research is urgently needed.

Aside from its use as construction materials (cement substituent/
additive and aggregate) and in soil amelioration, biomass ash can
be utilized in other fields such as flue gas cleaning (as adsorbents
for SOx, NOx, mercury, and other toxic metals), wastewater treat-
ment (removal of dyes and heavy metals), synthesis of zeolite,
production of ceramic, mine backfill, forestry, and wasteland rec-
lamation. All these applications have been reviewed comprehensively
in references 176,178,195,200; thus, a review of the literature is not
made in this paper.

Although there are numerous utilization approaches for biomass
ash, and many studies have verified their feasibility, the majority
of biomass ash is discarded. Technical, economic, institutional, and
legal regulations should be established to address the lack of uti-
lization of biomass ash.

Technical verification is essential for the practical use of biomass
ash. However, several key parameters such as biomass ash yield, ash
properties, commercial validation, user requirements, and related
specifications and standards are scarce and sporadic.

Economic balance is another key barrier. For biomass ash utili-
zation that brings extra income, whether or not the income can
overcome the logistical costs is the key factor for the producer. There-
fore, economic incentives play an important role in biomass ash
utilization.

Institutional and legal regulations serve as guidelines for the uti-
lization of biomass ash. Besides the lack of knowledge on potential
ash utilization, compositional inconsistencies and changes in the
products, belief that other raw materials are readily available, and
scarce data on environment and health effects, the lack of state guide-
lines and laws and rigid or incomplete industry and environment
regulations further limit the utilization of biomass ash.

To promote the extensive utilization of biomass ash, firstly, the
state or local government should formulate or revise relevant legal
regulations to force the implementation of recycling and establish
incentive policies that can act as a strong driving force for busi-
nesses to strengthen their technological research, various application
verification, and market development. Secondly, the cooperation
between biomass-fired power plants and other industries should
be strengthened; this is the bridge between biomass ash utiliza-
tion and extending/developing/introducing new applications. Thirdly,
technical research on existing potential approaches (e.g., use of
biomass ash as construction materials, soil ameliorant, and
adsorbents and use in metal recovery) should be intensified. Finally,
the logistics between the operator of biomass-fired plants and the
users of the ash should be improved concerning ash removal, treat-
ment, storage and transport. At last, ensuring stable biomass and
ash qualities is also essential for biomass ash utilization.

5. Conclusions

Although biomass firing and co-firing power plants have been
rapidly developed around the world, these power plants continue
to face various challenges that arise during combustion. This study
focused on intractable ash-related issues, namely, alkali-induced
slagging, silicate melt-induce slagging (ash fusion), agglomera-
tion, corrosion, and ash utilization, as well as potential remedies,
including the use of additives, co-firing, leaching, alloying, and others.
For alkali-induced slagging, which is mainly associated with alkali
metals especially alkali chlorides and sulfates, preliminary alkali-
salt generation and transformation mechanisms have been presented
to clarify the alkali chemistry during biomass combustion. Alkali
chemistry is affected significantly by the fuel species, ash compo-
nents (such as the concentrations of alkalis, S, Cl, Si, Al, etc. as well
as the ratios of alkali/Cl and S/Cl), combustion temperature, and com-
bustion atmosphere (concentrations of SO2, O2, H2O, etc.). The
formation of alkali-induced slagging, shown as an alternating over-
lapping multi-layered structure, and its growth mechanisms are
discussed in detail. The formation is highly dependent on the re-
enrichment of fine particles containing high concentrations of K,
Na, Cl, and S in the forms of alkali chloride and sulfates, the re-
capture of coarse particles containing high Si, Al, etc., and the
existence of an initial slagging layer primarily containing fine alkali
chloride and sulfate particles. The criterion numbers or evalua-
tion indexes, particularly the Cl ratio (Cl + K2O + Na2O)/(SiO2 + Al2O3)

Reduce hydraulic conductivity by 25% and improve water-holding capacity

At application rates > 25%, there was a consistent increase in water-holding capacity
(except domino loam), and a decrease in bulk density and modulus of rupture in all soil
tested. The hydraulic conductivity increased with small amounts of fly ash, but declined
rapidly as fly ash volume increased. At a low applicant rate, fly ash amendment
appeared useful in improving certain agronomic properties of soils.

Fly ash addition reduced density and swelling, and increased void ratio, shear strength
and value of cohesion. The fly ash may be effectively utilized in soil to get improvement
in shear strength, cohesion, and thus improvement in the bearing capacity.
Increased the porosity, water holding capacity, pH, conductivity, sulfate, carbonate,
bicarbonate, chloride, O, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn and B. While significant reduced N content.
Plant growth, yield, carotenoids, and chlorophylls were mostly enhanced in the
treatment with 40–80% fly ash, being optimal at 50 or 60%. From 60 or 70% onward, the
measured parameters tended to reduce, and considerably reduced at 100% fly ash.
All rates of lime tested and FA rates at or above 20 g/kg increased the spoil pH, and FA is
a feasible alternative to lime for treating acidic coal spoils in the regio.

Integrated use of fly ash, organic wastes and chemical fertilizers was beneficial in
improving crop yield, soil pH, organic carbon and available N, P and K in sandy loam
acid lateritic soil.
FA can be a good soil amendment for rice production without B toxicity.
Improved physical properties of soil and growth and yield of rice at 10Mg/, ha

40% fly ash caused a higher increase in growth and yield than did 20%; while 60%, 80%,
and 100% fly ash had an adverse effect on growth and yield
The application of fly ash at 40 t/ha in conjunction with P. striata inoculation improved
the bean yield and P uptake by grain. The available phosphorus of soil also showed an
upward trend. The fly ash did not exert any detrimental effect on the population of
inoculated bacteria.
Improved physical properties of soils (water-holding capacity, plant available water, and
water retention capacity)
Both types of amendments reduced bulk density, and increased saturated hydraulic
conductivity and moisture retention capacity of soil.

High rates of FA to soil may hinder normal decomposition and nutrient cycling
processes.
Invertase, amylase, dehydrogenase and protease activity increased with increasing
application of fly-ash up to 10 t/ha, but decreased with higher levels of FA application.
Alkalizing effects of FA can be utilized to reduce plant accumulation of potentially toxic
elements, particularly in poorly buffered acidic soils.

3% FA amendment on sandy loam soil enhanced decomposition rate of soil organic
carbon in comparison to control.
Higher microbial activities in soil amended with up to 8% FA and combined application
of FYM and FA proved to be beneficial in augmenting proliferation and activity of
microorganisms in acid soil.
FA incorporation in texturally variant soils modifies the soil physical and physico-
chemical environment that in turn may influence the crop yields.

Helped to reduce metal solubility and availability to plants
Improved physico-chemical properties of soil and plant grown, net primary
productivity, leaf area and photosynthetic pigments.
The electrical conductivity and pH of both recipient soils were raised, but more so for
the sandy soil. The increase in electrical conductivity may limit the availability of soil
water because of the high osmotic pressure and the increased pH would alter the
availability of micro-elements to plants.
FA at the highest rate raised the pH of sandy soil and sandy loam from 7.3 and 6.7 to 9.7
and 8.6, respectively. Both accumulation and reduction of metals in plant tissue were
significantly correlated with the pH of FA-amended soils.
Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may make a substantial contribution to successful
crop establishment in soils overlying areas of coal fly ash.

and S ratio (Svolatile + K2O + Na2O)/(SiO2 + Al2O3), that influence the for-
mation and growth of slagging are also discussed. Subsequently,
considerable attention should be focused on research into the ki-
netics of R 1–R 15, which are essential for the transformation, and
sequestration of alkali species. Meanwhile, further evaluation and
improvement on the existing criterion numbers of alkali-induced
slagging based on industry practice are necessary.

Silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion) depends not only
on the elemental composition, where the initial deformation
temperature increases as the contents of MgO, CaO, Fe2O3, and
Al2O3 increase and decrease with increasing K2O and SiO2 con-
tents in the ash, but also on the mineral components, where
refractory minerals (such as quartz, metakaolinite, and mullite)
increase ash fusion temperatures and fluxing minerals (such as
anhydrite, calcium silicate, and hematite) reduce them. The effects
and evolution of both elemental and mineral components during
combustion should be addressed together. In addition, the pseudo
4D phase diagrams of (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-
SiO2-Al2O3 can serve as effective tools to forecast the ash fusion
characteristics or the potential properties of melt-induced slagging;
however, the diagrams should be constructed according to statis-
tical data from real biomass ashes rather than from simulated
ashes obtained by the addition of partial metal oxides to biomass/
biomass ashes or the direct mixing of metal oxides. A combination
of heterogeneous chemical kinetics and multiphase equilibrium
models is essential to estimate the speciation, saturation levels,
and the presence of melt of ash-forming matter and to obtain
reliable guidance.

Agglomeration, which typically occurs in FB, results from the in-
teraction between ash-forming elements in the fuel and the bed
particles. For fuels containing K and relatively low Si content, bed
agglomeration is initiated by molten potassium silicates formed on
the bed particle surfaces by reaction with gaseous or liquid K com-
pounds. The bed material plays an active role in the agglomeration
processes. For fuels with high alkali metal and organically bound
Si or P content, bed agglomeration is initiated by the direct adhe-
sion of bed particles by partly molten ash-derived potassium silicate
particles/droplets and potassium phosphates particles/droplets; ag-
glomeration is more dependent on the compositions of the fuel ash.
The former is called “coating-induced” agglomeration, and the latter
is called “melt-induced” agglomeration. Generally, quartz and natural
sand bed materials are problematic when fuels with high alkali metal
content are combusted. Olivine and blast-furnace slag can be suc-
cessfully used as bed material substituent. However, the optimal
solution for agglomeration requires further study, particularly to find
effective combinations of fuels and bed materials, as well as prac-
tical agglomeration indicators.

Corrosion that occurs in biomass combustion is initiated by Cl2,
gaseous alkali chlorides, solid/deposited alkali chlorides, molten alkali
chlorides, molten alkali sulfates, molten alkali carbonates, and
sulfation/silication of alkali chlorides. High temperatures improve
the diffusion of gas reactants (Cl2 and O2) and gaseous reaction prod-
ucts (KCl and CrCl2) and, thus, result in accelerated corrosion. For
certain alkali chlorides, the corrosion strength of the molten state
is the highest followed by that of the solid state; the gaseous state
causes the smallest degree of corrosion. The presence of potas-
sium induces initial oxidation acceleration with potassium chromate
formed as the intermediate. The presence of chlorides and chlo-
rine is essential for corrosion to continue. For molten state corrosion,
high Cr content accelerates corrosion by forming low-melting K2Cr2O7
and eutectic KCl-K2CrO4. For other types of corrosion related to active
oxidation to some extent, high Cr content inhibits the process by
forming a protective Cr2O3 oxide layer because of higher Cr supply
than loss by evaporation. Aside from Cr, research on Si, Al, and Co,
which exhibit high corrosion resistance when used as coating or
alloying elements, should be strengthened. Meanwhile, heavy metals

such as Zn and Pb, which may form low melting chlorides and ac-
celerate corrosion, need scruple.

Alkali chlorides and sulfates, as the dominant alkali species re-
sponsible for the mentioned ash-related issues, can be controlled
by using additives, co-firing, and leaching. Lime/calcite, kaolin, zeo-
lites, and sulfur are effective additive candidates for certain problems;
however, in practice, the combined effect of these additives on all
aspects of the ash-related problems should be balanced. For example,
sulfur can reduce corrosion initiated by chlorine present in depos-
its, but it may result in a high deposit formation rate and could
worsen slagging. Co-firing, as the most effective remedy, also re-
quires further industrial practice verification. Through leaching, the
elements (K, Na, Cl, and S) that cause significant problems during
combustion can be completely removed, solving the ash-related
problems. However, a proper leaching process (including water
amount, water application rate, and leaching duration/time) should
be implemented because of the combined effect of both diffusion
control and mechanical processes. In addition, as a supplement for
technical leaching, natural leaching by rain and snow during the field
drying period should be encouraged as an option in bio-fuel quality
optimization.

With the rapid development of biomass combustion power gen-
eration, the large volumes of ash produced as a by-product have
become an intractable problem throughout the world. The major-
ity of biomass ashes is discarded because the standards for ash
utilization of various countries are restrictive; in particular, in the
two main potential fields of construction material and agricultur-
al soil ameliorant. To promote the extensive utilization of biomass
ash, legal regulations, cooperation between biomass-fired power
plants and other industries, potential technical research and logis-
tics should be strengthened.

Lastly, alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash
fusion), agglomeration, and corrosion occur concurrently and should
thus be investigated jointly rather than separately.
