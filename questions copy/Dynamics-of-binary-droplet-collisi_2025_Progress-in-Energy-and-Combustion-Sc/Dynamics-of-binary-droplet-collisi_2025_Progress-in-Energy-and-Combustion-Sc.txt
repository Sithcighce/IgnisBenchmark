Binary droplet collisions, relevant for various natural phenomena and technological processes, embodies a rich 
fluid-dynamical platform covering a wide range of physical scales. This review begins with the collision between 
two identical droplets to reveal the underlying physics of the transition between droplet coalescence, bouncing, 
and separation. The interplay between the macroscopic droplet motion, the internal flow, and the microscopic 
interfacial gas film dynamics involving rarefied flow and van der Waals molecular force reflect the essential 
multi-scale and multi-physics characteristics of the collision dynamics. The review then discusses the collision 
between unequal-sized droplets, non-Newtonian fluids, dissimilar fluids, and the analogical jet-jet collisions. 
Fundamental understanding on the basic binary droplet collisions phenomena and its inference on practical 
processes is emphasized.

1. Introduction
The size and interaction between the constituent droplets within a 
spray are of inherent interest in myriad natural and technical processes. 
Ancient Chinese has a mythological interpretation that the intensity of 
rainfall, related to cloud formation, is controlled by Yinglong (“應龍”), a 
winged dragon deity, whose sneeze leads to drizzles and spit to showers 
(Fig. 1a). As examples of practical interest, meteorologists need to know 
the size distribution of raindrops in order to interpret the radar data 
measured through a rain fall [1], while in various industrial and engine 
applications, such as diesel, gas turbine, and rocket engines, the liquid 
fuel is broken into multitudes of droplets through spraying in order to 
increase the total liquid surface area to facilitate gasification.
Early studies on spraying suggested that it is unlikely that the 
droplets would collide due to their dilute nature or if they move along 
divergent paths, as in the widely used hollow cone sprays shown in 
Fig. 1b. However, droplet collision is expected in the initial dense near- 
nozzle zones, as well as for sprays that are oriented to intersect to 
facilitate atomization, also shown in Fig. 1b. The droplet collision

probability would increase substantially for the jet-jet impingement 
sprays that are widely used in, for example, high-thrust rocket engines 
[2–4] and opposed-piston compression ignition engines [5–7]. For spray 
applications in daily life, such as in urban and forest firefighting and the 
use of humidifier with atomizer, shown in Fig. 1c, droplet collisions are 
expected to significantly affect the droplet size distribution. Indeed, 
droplet collisions are considered in various studies [8–13] which satis­
factorily reproduce the experimental observations of liquid jet sprays.
Given that droplet collisions do occur within a spray, it is then 
essential to assess if the collision between two droplets would lead to 
their coalescence or rebound [14–18]. An earlier, much noted work by 
O’Rourke and Bracco [19] and O’Rourke [20] attempted to explain the 
experimental observation of the increasing droplet size in the 
dense-spray region near the injection nozzle of an engine by assuming 
that collision always leads to coalescence.
Subsequent to the work of O’Rourke and Bracco [19], it was noted 
that the earlier studies [21,22] on droplet collision have involved water 
droplets colliding in atmospheric air, while the liquid for applications in 
internal combustion engines are hydrocarbons whose rheological 
properties are quite different from those of water, and that the engine 
pressure can be substantially above atmospheric. Subsequent studies 
[22,23] showed that droplet collision not only could result in bouncing, 
the bouncing event actually straddles the coalescence outcome with 
increasing impact inertia, resulting in a non-monotonic response of 
coalescence, bouncing and coalescence again. Furthermore, bouncing is 
promoted at elevated pressures.
The above results have subsequently motivated extensive studies on 
the underlying physics controlling droplet coalescence and bouncing, 
ranging from continuum fluid mechanics governing the droplet dy­
namics and its internal motion, to the rarefied flow of the gas film be­
tween the impacting interfaces, and the van der Waals molecular 
attraction describing possible merging of the interfaces. The richness of 
the phenomena, and the potential for further fundamental advance and 
practical utility, merit a review of these worthy contributions, recog­
nizing that several recent reviews have focused on droplet coalescence 
[15], bouncing [18], and the physicochemical hydrodynamics of droplet 
systems [24]. The present review distinguishes and extends the coverage 
on the general droplet impact phenomena by emphasizing the 
underlying physics ranging from the molecular length scale of the van 
der Waals force to the continuum scale of droplet deformation and 
viscous loss, leading to a comprehensive description of the various 
outcomes. Only the most representative papers are cited in this review to 
highlight the fundamental fluid dynamics of droplet collision, so as to 
avoid unnecessarily redundant literature citations.
The present review starts from defining the problem of collision 
between two identical droplets, for which the distinct collision response 
of coalescence, bouncing, and separation subsequent to coalescence are 
described, in Sec. 2. Richer phenomena emerge when the collision 
symmetry is broken by size disparity and liquid dissimilarity, in Sec. 3
and Sec. 4 respectively, and for collision of non-Newtonian fluids, in Sec. 
5. Jet-jet collisions, as an analog of droplet-droplet collisions, is dis­
cussed in Sec. 6 to demonstrate their fundamental similarity. Energy- 
related applications and suggestions for future works are presented in 
Sec. 7. It will be demonstrated that the superficially simple problem of 
droplet collision turns out to be a rather rich phenomenon comprising 
various dynamical and surface processes operating over a wide range of 
physical scales.
2. Collision of identical droplets
2.1. Phenomenology and regime nomogram
We first consider the collision of two identical droplets along an 
oblique path, as schematically shown in Fig. 2a. The inertial frame of 
reference moves with the center of mass of the two-body system, such 
that the centers of the droplets (O1,O2) have initial velocities U1 and U2 
with respect to the reference frame. In general, the relative velocity U =
U2 −U1 is not aligned with the connection O1O2 of the centers of mass 
of the droplets, and the perpendicular distance from O1 to U is χ. The 
density and viscosity are denoted by ρ and μ for the liquid and ρ∞ and μ∞ 
for the gas, respectively. The diameters of the droplets are D1 = D2 = D, 
and the surface tension coefficient is σ. The center of mass coordinate 
frame is generally used for the droplet collision problem, in which the 
center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the 
coordinate system so that the linear momentum of the entire system 
remains zero. For collision between two identical droplets with a

relative velocity U, the velocity for each droplet is simply U/ 2.
Experimentally observed collision outcomes are often presented in a 
We −B nomogram, where We = ρDU2/σ is the collision Weber number 
and B = χ/D the impact parameter, as shown in Fig. 2b. It is seen that, 
for head-on (B = 0) or near head-on collisions, with increasing We to 
about 100, the collision outcome transitions from “soft” coalescence 
(Regime I), to bouncing (Regime II), to “hard” coalescence (Regime III), 
and to “reflexive” separation (Regime IV). For sufficiently off-center 
collisions with larger B, the regime transition with increasing We 
mostly follows the same trend as that for near head-on collisions, with 
separation at large B, often referred to as “stretching” separation 
(Regime V).
We now consider the collision impact and response in the various 
regimes, as shown in Fig. 2c. In Regime I the droplets have small velocity 
and/or small size and coalesce after minor deformation; hence “soft” 
coalescence. Mechanistically, upon close contact, the gas between the 
droplets is readily drained out by the impacting droplet interfaces. When 
the interfacial distance reaches O
(
10−8)
m, the van der Waals attractive 
force between the interfaces becomes effective [26], and rapidly pulls 
the interfaces together, leading to their coalescence. Since mass, mo­
mentum, and energy must be simultaneously conserved upon merging of 
two spherical masses into one, the coalescence event would be accom­
panied by various extents of internal motion and shape deformation, 
which viscously dissipates the excessive energy so that the coalesced 
mass would remain as a single droplet. As such, droplet coalescence is 
inherently inelastic.
In Regime II, the increased impact velocity reduces the time avail­
able for the drainage of the gas film, which is also prolonged by the 
larger stretched deformation of the interfaces. Consequently, if the 
droplet impact inertia is dissipated before the interfaces are close 
enough to activate the van der Waals force, the interfaces will not coa­
lesce. Instead, they will repel each other as the droplets attempt to 
restore their spherical shape under the action of surface tension, and 
consequently rebound.
In Regime III, with the further increase of We and hence impact 
inertia, the interfacial gas film can now be successfully drained out, 
resulting in (hard) coalescence with large deformation.
In Regime IV, the coalesced mass from Regime III now has an excess 
kinetic energy that cannot be completely damped, which will overcome 
the surface tension of the coalesced mass to cause it to separate. 
Furthermore, the reflexive separation during the symmetrical head-on 
collision between two identical droplets must always be accompanied 
by the generation of at least one satellite droplet [27] to accommodate 
all the residue kinetic energy through surface tension of the new droplets 
generated (see Fig. 2c), unless the droplet viscosity is substantially large 
or by breaking the mirror symmetry with size disparity or 
off-centeredness.
In Regime V, the off-centered colliding droplets undergo coalescence 
followed by separation. Different from that in Regime IV, the coalesced 
mass rotates due to the global angular momentum of the collision, 
leading to its substantial stretching during separation.
In addition to the above five regimes, either for We beyond ~100 or 
for B close to zero, the merged mass forms a liquid sheet following 
coalescence and subsequently breaks into many tiny droplets due to the 
instabilities of the sheet [25], for example, the rim transverse instability 
[28], 
Rayleigh-Taylor 
instability 
[29,30], 
followed 
by 
the 
Rayleigh-Plateau instability [30]. This regime is referred to as droplet 
splashing (Regime VI). Apart from the canonical stretching separation 
regime caused by the stretching flow with sufficient off-centeredness, 
Pan et al. [31] found a new regime, termed “rotational separation”, in 
the We −B parameter space, showing remarkable rotational motion 
before separation, recognizing that rotation itself dissipates energy 
without directly causing separation [31,32]. The rotational separation is 
not instantly activated at the initial droplet contact and subsequent 
stretching, rather the droplet rotation appears to accompany the delayed 
reflexive or internal motions to cause eventual separation.
Based on the broad overview of the collision dynamics and the 
outcome described above, we now study in detail the mechanisms 
governing the key individual phenomena of soft coalescence (Regime I), 
transition from soft to hard coalescence via bouncing (Regimes I-II-III), 
and reflexive and stretching separations (Regimes IV & V). Subsequently 
we shall demonstrate that the environment pressure and composition, 
and the rheological properties of the droplets, exert essential influence 
on the collision response.
2.2. Soft coalescence
We first consider soft coalescence from the perspective that surface 
tension is a thermodynamic potential that drives the colliding droplets 
to coalesce in order to minimize their surface energy [33]. The Weber 
number represents the ratio of the initial total kinetic energy of the 
droplets, Et = (π /24)ρD3U2, and the initial surface energy, ES = 2πσD2, 
such that Et/ES = We/48; noting that the “total kinetic energy” Et de­
notes the integration of the kinetic energy for each mass point within the 
droplet. Consequently, for soft collision with sufficiently small We, 
surface energy dominates and the droplets tend to coalesce to minimize 
it.
Gas film drainage has also been considered in phenomenological 
models of the coalescence process [34], in which coalescence occurs if 
the characteristic collision time, τc = D/U, is larger than the charac­
teristic film drainage time, τd; otherwise bouncing occurs. It is however 
generally difficult to analytically express τd as a function of the collision 
parameters except for the limiting cases such as constant interaction 
force or constant approach velocity [34]. Determining τd in general re­
quires analyzing the gas film dynamics [18,35]. Microscopically, droplet 
coalescence occurs if the van der Waals force eventually destabilizes the 
thin gas film between the impacting interfaces. The destabilization takes 
the form as the growth of small perturbation and its characteristic time is 
significantly shorter than τd.
Dynamically, coalescence is manifested by the drastic reduction of 
the time-dependent characteristic film thickness, h, as shown in Fig. 3. 
Fig. 3. Schematic of the evolution of gas film, divided into three stages. Stage I: 
fast approaching stage with the droplets having slight deformation, and the 
intervening pressure about to be built up; Stage II: slow approaching stage 
when the gas film is formed and drained; and Stage III: fast merging stage when 
the van der Waals force is dominant. Critical film thickness hcr is defined as the 
inflection point of the h(t) curve and film drainage time τd is dominated by 
Stage II.

The van der Waals force between macroscopic objects in different ge­
ometries can be assessed by using the Hamaker model [26], for which

2.3. Coalescence-bouncing-coalescence transition
The occurrence of the bouncing Regime II, separating the soft and 
hard coalescence Regimes I and III, was experimentally observed only 
relatively recently [22], in 1992. This observation has substantially 
enriched understanding of the underlying physics and the subsequent 
response of binary droplet collisions. Mechanistically, as anticipated in 
the previous sub-section, since the collision outcome depends on the 
interaction between the two colliding interfaces separated by a gaseous 
layer which is continuously being squeezed out, the macroscopic me­
chanics, based on the continuum description of the droplet dynamics 
and surface morphology, must be functionally coupled to the micro­
scopic mechanics implementing the intermolecular force responsible for 
interface merging.
Zhang and Law [36] modelled the transition, as shown in Fig. 4, in 
which the gas film is approximated as flat with thickness h(t), and the 
droplet as a spherical cap with radius R(t) of the sphere and radius a(t) of 
the base of the cap. Mass, momentum and energy conservation then 
yields three fully coupled ODEs for the three geometric quantities. The 
Boltzmann equation with the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model for 
the rarefied gas flow between the two radially expanding parallel disks 
are analytically solved through asymptotic matching, leading to an 
expression for the gas pressure as 
pg = 3μ∞/Δ(Kn)

8.7583Kn1.1551 (Kn ≥1)
(2) 
For Kn≪1, Eq. (1) degenerates to the lubrication pressure of the gas flow 
between two mobile flat interfaces with an approaching velocity dh/dt 
and a strain rate κ = a−1(da /dt). Consequently, the estimated pressure 
within the gas film is the sum of the corrected pressure by rarefied gas 
effects and the van der Waals negative pressure pvdW. By further 
simplifying droplet deformation as a rapidly expanding or contracting 
disk, analogous to the von Karman rotating disk flow, in which the 
viscous effects are mainly restricted to a thin layer close to the flattened 
interface

The result shows the boundary-layer-like characteristics of the 
internal-flow-induced viscous dissipation Φ during the radial expansion 
process, which has been verified by numerical simulations [37,38]. This 
model qualitatively predicts the coalescence-bouncing-coalescence 
transition and their dependence on the gas pressure. It has been used 
to predict droplet coalescence and bouncing in various computational 
studies [39–42].
It is also important to recognize that while the above analysis can 
describe the merging versus bouncing outcome, it misses a crucial 
feature of the merging event. That is, since the pressure build-up within 
the interfacial film is the highest at the center, the interface would be 
dimpled (Fig. 4), being convex towards the droplet interior. Conse­
quently, merging of the impacting interfaces would take place at the rim, 
and thereby generate a central gas bubble within the merged mass. For 
the soft coalescence with slight deformation, the interface merging point 
is close to the mass center line, and hence less likely to form a bubble. 
Furthermore, even if a bubble is formed, its size would be significantly

smaller in volume than the hard coalescence with large deformation. 
This evolution of the gas film geometry has been reported in various 
studies [38,43–45], while the presence of an entrapped bubble has also 
been experimentally observed [21,46]. We shall show later that the 
presence of the trapped bubble can lead to an interesting development of 
the merged mass, such as causing it to rupture violently due to internal 
nucleation and gasification.
2.4. Reflexive and stretching separations
Most studies on reflexive and stretching separations (Regimes IV and 
V) were focused on delineating the boundaries between them and hard 
coalescence (Regime III). In these regimes, the Weber numbers are so 
large that Et/ES > 1, and hence a significant portion of the initial total 
kinetic energy is retained in the coalesced mass. Whether or not the 
excess kinetic energy can be dissipated rapidly determines separation or 
coalescence. This has two important implications. First, coalescence and 
particularly the gas film dynamics play a secondary role in the analysis 
of droplet separation. Second, the accumulated viscous dissipation 
throughout the entire separation process depends on evolution of the 
droplet internal flow, which is not accessible in most experiments and 
therefore requires additional modelling or numerical simulation. It is the 
separation criteria and the models of viscous dissipation that differen­
tiate the theoretical studies.
The reflexive and stretching separation has a unified schematic 
shown in Fig. 5. The entire process is separated into three stages. In the 
impacting stage (Stage I), the colliding droplets coalesce and then 
deform to attain the maximum surface area. In the contracting stage 
(Stage II), the droplet contracts under surface tension, and the surface 
energy is converted to the kinetic energy of the internal flow. Due to 
flow inertia, the contraction motion does not stop when the droplet at­
tains the minimum surface area. In the stretching stage (Stage III), the 
droplet keeps contracting in one direction and stretching in the other 
direction. Eventually, a liquid filament is formed and then broken due to 
the end-pinching mechanism [23].
For stretching separation, the coalesced mass rotates through the 
finite angular momentum, which is approximately a constant due to the 
negligible torque exerted by the surrounding gas. However, the rota­
tional velocity changes with time because the moment of inertia of the 
coalesced mass changes due to the droplet deformation. As a result, the 
concomitant conversion between translational kinetic energy (calcu­
lated by translational mass center velocity) and rotational kinetic energy 
is an important feature of stretching separation.
Qian and Law [23] proposed a criterion for reflexive separation, 
based on energy balance, that separation occurs when the excess kinetic 
energy is non-vanishing at the end of stage III, 
Et + ES0 −ESf −Φ > 0
(4) 
where Et is the initial total kinetic energy, ES0 and ESf the surface energy 
at the beginning of stage I and the end of stage III, respectively, and Φ 
the accumulated viscous dissipation in the three stages. This expression 
indicates that the initial total kinetic energy of the droplets leading to 
separation can be divided into two parts, namely for overcoming viscous 
dissipation and interface oscillation, and for compensating the addition 
of surface energy due to the deformation. The viscous dissipation in 
stage I is found to be independent of the viscosity coefficient and is 
proportional to We [22]. This independence can be understood in that a 
larger viscosity coefficient causes a smaller strain rate by damping the 
droplet internal flow, hence rendering a neutral influence on the accu­
mulated viscous dissipation. The viscous dissipation in stages II and III 
are estimated by the surface tension driven flow determined by the 
balance between the dynamic and capillary pressures [23]. Conse­
quently, it is found that the critical Weber number Wec of 
coalescence-separation transition is a linear function of the Ohnesorge 
number Oh, as 
Wec = βOh + γ

and III) with the kinetic energy, surface energy, and viscous dissipation rate varying with time. The other modelling consideration from the perspectives of energy 
balance, force/momentum balance, and singularity formation, focuses on the characteristics of droplet deformation at a certain time instant.

where β is a geometric parameter independent of the fluid properties, 
while γ the additional surface energy induced by the droplet deforma­
tion. This result has been verified in Gotaas et al. [47] and Tang et al. 
[48].
Following the insights of “rotational separation” of Pan et al. [31], 
He et al. [49] extended the above model to include stretching separation 
by subtracting the rotational kinetic energy (Er) on the right-hand side of 
Equation (4). The rotational kinetic energy tends to reduce the reflexive 
or stretching kinetic energy, which respectively accounts for the re­
flexive and stretching separation, and promotes droplet coalescence. For 
head-on collision, this model degenerates to that of Qian and Law [23].
For stretching separation, Brazier-Smith et al. [50] observed that the 
rotating drop has concave poles as increasing the spin angular speed and 
the drop tends to separate once the opposite poles meet, and proposed a 
criterion that the merged droplet will separate for Er > ES if its rotational 
kinetic energy Er exceeds the surface energy ES required to re-create the 
two parent drops from the temporarily united drop. Both energies are 
estimated at the end of stage II. Based on the force/momentum balance 
at the end of stage III, Jiang et al. [22] argued that stretching separation 
occurs if the centrifugal force F (by shearing flow) exceeds the bonding 
force by the surface tension S and the viscous force D by the shearing 
flow layer between the sliding masses, with F ≥S + D. This criterion is 
of the same form as that of Brazier-Smith et al. [50].
Ashgriz and Poo [21] ignored the viscous dissipation energy and 
separated the droplet internal flows into reflective and stretching parts 
at the beginning of stage I, which respectively account for the reflexive 
and stretching separations. Reflexive separation occurs when the 
effective reflexive energy, equal to the kinetic energy of the drop mass 
which directly interacts with each other, as the dashed region shown in 
Fig. 5, is more than 75 % of its nominal surface energy. Stretching 
separation occurs when the effective stretching kinetic energy, namely 
the leftover initial kinetic energy of the parent drops, is larger than the 
surface energy of the region of interaction. This model, with some 
modifications, yields good agreement with the experiments [47,51,52].
It is further noted that, from the singularity formation perspective, 
droplet separation is caused by the formation of a certain number of 
singularities [53,54] on the substantially deformed droplet. Al-Dirawi 
et al. [55] experimentally found a critical dimensionless length of the 
stretching filament Lc/D = 3.35, beyond which separation occurs.
To summarize the modeling of droplet coalescence and separation, 
while the usually used energy budget perspective is convenient for 
modeling, it requires sufficient detail about the complex droplet defor­
mation and inner flow to model the viscous dissipation. The currently 
reviewed models by merely using the energy budget analysis [21,23,48,
49] are incomplete to describe the entire separation. Alternatively, the 
instantaneous force/momentum balance analysis [22,50] at a certain 
instant can characterize the local droplet deformation and internal flow 
that account for the separation – such as the formation of a certain 
number of singularities [53,55] triggering separation. However, such 
analyses disregard the droplet deformation history and require corre­
lation with the initial collision conditions. Thus, a comprehensive 
droplet collision model must include both: the energy budget during the 
entire collision process and the local force/momentum balance to 
generate the singularities.

2.5. Effects of gas properties
Following the observation of Jiang et al. [22] that, unlike the case of 
water droplets, the collision of hydrocarbon droplets, also at 1 atm 
pressure, could lead to bouncing instead of merging, as discussed earlier, 
Qian and Law [23] conducted experiments at reduced and elevated 
pressures, from 0.6 to 12 atm, and showed that bouncing actually 
occurred for water droplets at elevated pressures, while coalescence is 
promoted for hydrocarbon droplets at reduced pressures, as shown in 
the regime diagrams of Fig. 6a and b.
This outcome is physically intuitive as higher pressure and hence 
high gas density increases the mass inertia of the gas film to be drained, 
hence promoting bouncing at higher pressures and retarding it at lower 
pressures, and as such unifies the collision outcomes of water and the 
hydrocarbons. Their different surface tension and viscosity simply shift 
the respective transition boundaries between coalescence and bouncing.
The pressure effect on the regime transition was also qualitatively 
demonstrated in the theory of Zhang and Law [36] and confirmed in 
modeling sprays at elevated pressures [12,56–58], especially for its 
relevance in modeling spray processes in internal combustion engines.
Gas pressure and hence density is not the only gas property influ­
encing the collision outcome. Qian and Law [23] experimentally 
demonstrated that, while the nitrogen gas density at 1 atm is almost the 
same as the helium gas density at 7.5 atm, bouncing is more prominent 
in helium, as shown in Fig. 6c. This difference is caused by the higher 
viscosity of helium, which increases the lubrication gas pressure and 
therefore promotes droplet bouncing.
Apart from the gas density and viscous effects, Park [59] experi­
mentally observed that coalescence of water drops was progressively 
facilitated by increasing the humidity of a nitrogen environment. Qian 
and Law [23] experimentally studied the tetradecane droplet collision in 
mixtures of nitrogen and ethylene, where ethylene has the same mo­
lecular weight as nitrogen and is structurally like tetradecane, both 
being aliphatic compounds. They found that, as shown in Fig. 6d, the 
propensity to bounce is greatly reduced and only off-center bouncing 
was observed. This again is physically reasonable as the presence of the 
fuel vapor of the colliding droplet reduces the surface tension, hence 
promotes coalescence. The practical implication is significant as the 
spray interior invariably consist of pre-vaporized liquid fuel, hence 
promoting coalescence.
3. Collision of unequal-sized droplets
3.1. Collision outcomes
The symmetry of droplet deformation is broken for the collision 
between two droplets of unequal sizes, as shown in Fig. 7a, where the 
size ratio Δ = D2/D1 ≥1 quantifies the effects of the size disparity. The

velocity for each droplet under the center of mass coordinate frame can 
be calculated as UΔ3/
(
1 +Δ3)
for the smaller droplet and U/
(
1 +Δ3)
for 
the larger droplet [48], respectively. The kinetic energy and momentum 
are then calculated based on each relative velocity.
Tang et al. [48] studied the head-on collision of two unequal-sized 
droplets for different liquids (water, n-decane, and n-tetradecane) and 
found that, for a given liquid, the transition We from bouncing (Regime 
II) to hard coalescence (Regime III) is slightly influenced by Δ, whereas 
that from hard coalescence (Regime III) to reflexive separation (Regime 
IV) increases significantly with increasing Δ, as shown in Fig. 7b. They 
attributed the suppressed separation regime to the enhanced 
internal-flow-induced viscous dissipation and hence the reduced excess 
kinetic energy for separation. This was verified by subsequent compu­
tational studies [37,61,62]. In addition, they extended the separation 
model, Equation (5), to account for the size-ratio effects; the model re­
duces to Equation (5) for Δ = 1. Based on the energy budget analysis of 
Testik [60] and Testik et al. [63], the We −Δ parameter space can be 
divided into three regimes, as shown in Fig. 7b, with Et < ES1 for 
bouncing, ES1 < Et < ES2 for coalescence, and Et > ES2 for separation. 
This model also qualitatively describes the collision regimes for rain­
drops [60,63] and reflects the competition between surface energy and 
kinetic energy.
As also shown in Fig. 7b, the soft coalescence of regime (I) was not 
observed in the head-on collision between two unequal-sized droplets. 
This absence is likely due to insufficiently low Weber numbers in these 
experiments, because the collision between two droplets of very large 
size ratio is difficult to accomplish in traditional experimental ar­
rangements. For off-center collision shown in Fig. 7c, a prominent 
finding is that the colliding droplets show suppressed separation with 
increasing Δ [21,51], which is manifested by an extended coalescence 
regime, with the boundary between coalescence and reflexive separa­
tion moving towards smaller B, whereas the boundary between coales­
cence and stretching separation moves towards larger B. Brazier-Smith 
et al. [50] explained that there is less angular momentum to pull the 
two droplets apart at larger Δ.
3.2. Internal jet formation
A prominent feature of unequal-sized droplet collision is internal 
mixing within the coalesced droplet. Anilkumar et al. [64] first observed 
an interesting mushroom-like jet formation upon coalescence between 
two initially stationary droplets of unequal sizes. Tang et al. [46] sub­
sequently observed a non-monotonic variation of mushroom-like jet 
structure with increasing We, shown in Fig. 8. Specifically, a 
mushroom-like jet structure occurs at small We (type I), disappears with 
increasing We, and re-emerges with another mushroom-like jet structure 
(type II) with further increasing We, albeit with a different jet 
configuration.
The type I mushroom-like jet at small We (Fig. 8a) is surface-tension- 
driven. Two droplets start to merge at the perimeter of the axis, which is 
generally the case occurring in the soft coalescence regime with minor 
droplet deformation, followed by the neck expansion and bulge forma­
tion of the small droplet. Then the bulge starts to merge into the large 
droplet with the bulge contracting, leading to either it being completely 
merged into the large droplet, or pinched off with the ejection of a 
secondary droplet by the interface Plateau–Rayleigh instability [54], as 
shown in Fig. 8a.
The type II mushroom-like jet at larger We is driven by impact 
inertia, schematically shown in Fig. 8b. Here the two droplets merge at 
the rim of the contact interface to spread the small droplet with a crater 
formation, which is generally the case occurring in the hard coalescence 
regime with large droplet deformation. Then a radially converging flow 
is formed during the crater restoration under capillary pressure to 
detach the spreading smaller droplet from the surface towards the axis. 
The competition between the opposite remaining impact inertia and the 
crater restoration results in either no jet formation, owing to the strong 
damping of the remaining impact inertia, or the mushroom-like jet (type 
II) formation with sufficiently large impact inertia.
Xia et al. [65] and Sun et al. [66] correlated the mushroom-like jet 
with the formation of a main vortex ring during droplet coalescence. 
Two mechanisms were observed, namely vortex-ring growth and 
vortex-ring detachment, that are essential to internal jet formation. The 
bulge merging tends to generate a significant amount of vorticity and a 
shorter duration for type I jet formation at smaller We, where the main 
vortex generation at high We becomes weaker to induce a vortex-ring 
structure and type II jet formation [66]. This vortex-ring generation 
has also been observed in droplet coalescence into a liquid pool [68–71]. 
Both type I and II jets are promoted with increasing Δ and We while

suppressed with increasing Oh [46].
Zhang et al. [67] experimentally determined a Δ−
Oh regime 
nomogram, showing that pinch-off occurs above a critical Δ at a certain 
Oh. Xia et al. [65] computationally supplemented the nomogram, where 
there exists a maximum Oh above which the mushroom-like structure is 
absent. The similar pinch-off phenomenon has also been observed in 
droplet-pool impact [72,73], which can be treated as the limiting case of 
infinite Δ.
4. Collision of Non-Newtonian droplets
Many fluids in engineering applications show the non-Newtonian 
fluid characteristics that the liquid viscosity is a function of the local 
shear rate instead of being a constant. It is however noted that the 
collision behaviors between two non-Newtonian droplets can be 
approximately assumed as the collision between two Newtonian drop­
lets with an effective viscosity [74,75]. Thus, it is logical to review the 
effects of liquid viscosities on droplet collision first, and then to review 
the non-Newtonian effects.
4.1. Effects of liquid viscosities
Liquid viscosity (Oh) has significant effects on droplet collision, 
which are not explicitly reflected in the typical We −B nomogram. This 
is because Oh is a weak function of the droplet size and hence has been 
treated as a constant in earlier experiments for a given liquid. Pan et al. 
[31] first plotted the 3D regime of We −B −Oh parameter space to 
explicitly reflect the appreciable effects of Oh. The apparent suppression 
of separation (Regimes IV and V) by increasing Oh is due to the increased 
viscous dissipation. Consequently, recent studies [47,52,57,76–78] have 
focused on the transition of bouncing (Regime II) to hard coalescence 
(Regime III) with widely varying Oh = 0.014 ∼0.216. It was found that 
for the collision between two identical droplets [76], increasing Oh 
tends to promote droplet coalescence, while Krishnan and Loth [57] 
showed that increasing Oh increases the bouncing probability, as shown 
in Fig. 9. Al-Dirawi and Bayly [76] attributed this to the different gas 
film structure and drainage mechanism with increasing Oh.
Gas film drainage is a significant feature of droplet collision, which 
accounts for when and how droplet bouncing occurs, as recently 
reviewed by Sprittles [18]. The gas drainage phenomenon can be un­
derstood by the interface mobility mechanism [76] at relatively small 
Oh and the flattening mechanism at large Oh. Specifically, the interface 
mobility [79] is defined as m = λ−1(a/h)1/2, where a is the characteristic 
length of the thin film in its span-wise direction, h the gas film thickness, 
and λ = μ/μ∞ the liquid-gas viscosity ratio. The interface is denoted as 
“fully mobile” (m≫1), “immobile” (m≪1), and otherwise “partially

mobile”. An increase of liquid viscosity μ causes a decrease of m showing 
decreased interface mobility, which equivalently results in an increase 
of the gas film thickness h and a decrease of the absolute value of the van 
der Waals pressure pvdW = −AH/6πh3 as discussed in Sec. 2.2, and 
consequently suppresses droplet coalescence at the rim induced by the 
van der Waals attractive force and promote droplet bouncing. It can also 
be understood as that decreasing interface mobility leads to decreasing 
gas film length a in its span-wise direction, in which gas drainage 
determined by the area of surface flattening can be suppressed by the 
reduced tangential stress along the interface, and consequently promote 
droplet bouncing again.
4.2. Shear-thinning liquids
Shear-thinning liquids are typical non-Newtonian fluids whose vis­
cosities decrease with increasing shearing rate, being opposite to the 
common shear-thickening liquids with the opposite viscosity-shear rate 
response.
Motzigemba et al. [80] studied the collision between two identical 
droplets of water/carboxymethylcellulose aqueous solution and found 
that droplet deformation is enhanced by shear thinning, as shown in 
Fig. 10a. Finotello et al. [77] studied the collision between two xanthan 
droplets and observed a thick toroidal rim during droplet spreading, as 
shown in Fig. 10b. The diameter of this thick toroidal rim expands 
significantly with increasing We without separation or film breakup for 
We up to 211. At such high We, splashing and film instability readily 
occur for Newtonian droplets.
Experimental studies on non-Newtonian droplet collision are few, 
probably because of the difficulties in generating spatially and tempo­
rally stable droplets with a large low-shear-rate viscosity. Focke and 
Bothe [75] computationally showed that collision between two identical 
shear-thinning droplets can be reproduced with two Newtonian droplets 
of an equivalent effective viscosity. Sun et al. [81,82] computationally 
found that internal mixing can be promoted by shear-thinning effects 
while droplet separation can be suppressed by shear-thickening to allow 
sufficient mixing, which is a promising concept for hypergolic 
fuel-oxidizer ignition in rocket engines [83–87].
5. Collision of dissimilar liquids
5.1. Miscible liquids
Compared with the collision between two identical droplets, the 
collision between two equal-sized droplets of different fluids [76,88–95] 
shows some distinct phenomena owing to the asymmetry in either vis­
cosity or surface tension. Droplet collision of dissimilar liquids can be 
further divided into two main types, namely those involving miscible 
and immiscible liquids.
Focke et al. [90] studied two miscible equal-sized droplets with 
sufficiently large viscosity disparity. The viscosity difference leads to the 
low-viscosity droplet moving faster and overlaying the interface of the 
high-viscosity droplet. For unequal-sized droplets, the smaller 
high-viscosity droplet would penetrate the larger low-viscosity droplet 
with partial encapsulation, as shown in Fig. 11a. This is because mass 
diffusion between the two miscible liquids is suppressed by the large 
viscosity, so the characteristic time of mass diffusion is sufficiently 
longer than the droplet coalescence time.
Al-Dirawi and Bayly [76] observed “partial bouncing” between two 
droplets with different viscosities, in which the low-viscosity droplet has 
a larger deformation and forms a ligament that retracts quickly into the 
low-viscosity droplet without significantly influencing its original vol­
ume, as shown in Fig. 11b. In fact, this “partial bouncing” is phenome­
nologically similar to droplet separation. The coalescence is shown in 
Fig. 11b, where the gas film could rupture either in the droplet 
impacting stage, that is before the droplets reach their maximum 
deformation, or the droplet bouncing stage [43]. However, the neck 
expansion [15,96–99] motion at the merged interface rim is sufficiently 
slower than the reflexive flow, as shown in Fig. 11b, leading to sepa­
ration of the ligament.
Chen [88] studied the collision between a diesel droplet and an 
Fig. 12. Collision between droplets of different immiscible liquids: (a) Coalescence and overlaying coalescence between water and diesel droplets for increasing 
Weber number (adapted from Chen and Chen [89]); (b) “quasi-reflective separation” and “crossing separation” between a glycerol solution droplet and a silicon oil 
mixture droplet at larger Weber number (adapted from Planchette et al. [93]); (c) schematic of the force balance at the three-phase contact line; and (d) evolution 
from complete encapsulation to the Janus state (adapted from Pannacci et al. [106]). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is

ethanol droplet, as shown in Fig. 11c, and found similar droplet defor­
mation as that between two identical diesel droplets. This is because 
diesel and ethanol have similar surface tension coefficients and densities 
although the viscosity of diesel is approximately twice that of ethanol. 
Prominent asymmetric droplet deformation and separation is observed 
for the collision between water and ethanol droplets [91], as shown in 
Fig. 11d. The Marangoni flow [100] induced by the surface tension 
difference drives the ethanol droplet, with a smaller surface tension, to 
move on the surface of the water droplet, with a larger surface tension, 
and eventually converges to eject satellite droplets.
5.2. Immiscible liquids
Different from the miscible droplet collision involving mass diffu­
sion, the collision between two immiscible droplets forms a moving 
three-phase contact line [101,102] that significantly affects the collision 
outcome.
Chen and Chen [89] observed a diesel droplet, with a smaller surface 
tension, overlaying on a water droplet, with a larger surface tension, as 
shown in Fig. 12a. This can be understood from either force imbalance 
or energy budget considerations: the force imbalance on the three-phase 
contact line upon coalescence pulls the liquid with the smaller surface 
tension overlaying the liquid with the larger surface tension; or the 
minimum surface energy consideration which allows the liquid with 
smaller surface tension to overlay the liquid with larger surface tension 
in order to reduce the total surface energy. The overlaying coalescence 
leads to the “transparent” diesel droplet about to separate either from 
the upper or bottom side of the merged droplets depending on the 
impact inertia, as shown in Fig. 12a.
Planchette et al. [93] studied the collision between a glycerol solu­
tion droplet and a silicon oil droplet and observed the so-called “qua­
si-reflective separation” and “crossing separation” after an overlaying 
coalescence, resulting in two encapsulated drops containing both glyc­
erol solution and silicon oil, as shown in Fig. 12b.
For “overlaying coalescence”, also referred as liquid encapsulation 
by Planchette et al. [92,103], the encapsulating droplet either overlays 
partially over the encapsulated droplet to form a “Janus droplet” [104] 
or completely to form a “liquid shell” [103]. Regardless of dynamical 
encapsulation, the equilibrium states between the two immiscible 
droplets (complete engulfing, partial engulfing, and non-engulfing) 
involving the three-phase contact line (Fig. 12c) can be determined by 
a spreading parameter [95,105] defined by Si = σjk + σik −σij (i,j,k = 1,
2,3). There are only three possible sets of values of Si that satisfy (S1 < 0,
S2 < 0, S3 > 0) for complete engulfing, (S1 < 0, S2 < 0, S3 < 0) for par­
tial engulfing, and (S1 < 0,S2 > 0, S3 < 0) for non-engulfing, as shown 
in Fig. 12d, which are also indicated by Pannacci et al. [106] in a regime 
of spreading parameters. The detailed mechanism governing droplet 
encapsulation, possibly correlated to the time scale of overlaying and 
droplet deformation processes, requires further study.
5.3. Internal bubble entrapment and collision-induced micro-explosion
It was theoretically postulated [107] that the gasification and com­
bustion of a miscible, multicomponent droplet spanning a wide extent of 
volatilities, and hence boiling points, could undergo internal gasification 
leading to violent droplet rupturing, which has been termed “micro-­
explosion”. Its occurrence enhances droplet/spray atomization, espe­
cially for high-boiling-point fuels such as diesel. Mechanistically, it is 
hypothesized that upon initiation of droplet gasification, say upon 
ignition, the more volatile components in the droplet’s surface layer are 
preferentially gasified. This subsequently sets up a concentration 
gradient within the droplet, with the surface layer becoming progres­
sively more concentrated with the less volatile, higher boiling point 
components and the interior with the more volatile, lower boiling point 
components. Furthermore, due to the extremely slow rate of 
liquid-phase mass diffusion, this state of concentration stratification 
persists, with the attainable droplet temperature controlled by the 
higher boiling points of the more abundant and less volatile components 
at the surface. Consequently, the more volatile, lower-boiling-point 
components trapped in the droplet interior would experience a 
high-temperature environment imposed by the less volatile, higher 
boiling point component, which could easily exceed the boiling point of 
the trapped volatile component. As an example, the normal boiling 
points of n-heptane and n-hexadecane, which are representative of the 
more and less volatile components of gasoline fuel, are 100oC and 256oC 
respectively. The more volatile component, however, does not readily 
gasify even it is subjected to a temperature higher than its boiling point 
unless there is some form of nucleation site. Consequently, it will only 
gasify when the internal temperature reaches the thermodynamic 
nucleation temperature to trigger homogeneous nucleation.
Various approaches have been implemented to facilitate internal 
gasification of the volatile components, such as increasing the envi­
ronment pressure and hence the boiling point of the less volatile com­
ponents [109,110], or to provide heterogeneous nucleation sites such as 
Fig. 13. Collision-induced bubble formation and micro-explosion between two miscible droplets: (a) Bubble formation from collision between two water droplets 
[21,46]; (b) micro-explosion between a heptane droplet and a hexadecane droplet (adapated from Wang et al. [108]).
C. He et al.

mixing solid particles in slurry fuels [111,112]. Another approach is to 
provide a gas-liquid interface within the droplet to facilitate gasification 
and hence micro-explosion, which can be realized through trapping of a 
gas bubble upon droplet coalescence – the phenomenon considered 
here.
In light of the above discussion, it is then of interest to note that no 
micro-explosion has been observed for single droplets consisting of two 
miscible liquids with vastly different boiling points, such as heptane and 
hexadecane, while prominent micro-explosion has been observed when 
the bi-component droplet is formed by colliding a heptane droplet with a 
hexadecane droplet, as respectively shown in Fig. 13 for burning droplet 
streams of either premixed or collision-generated heptane-hexadecane 
fuels [108]. This is because with collision an air bubble is trapped within 
the merged mass, whose interface would facilitate nucleation and hence 
rapid internal gasification of the superheated droplet mass, leading to 
explosion of the entire droplet.
6. Jet-jet collisions
Jet-jet collision [2,3,113] is often used in industrial applications to 
enhance liquid atomization in a limited space. Referring to what we 
have studied on droplet-droplet collision, Bush and Hasha [114] and 
Wadhwa et al. [115] first observed the analogous bouncing (II) and hard 
coalescence (III) phenomena for jet-jet collision with increasing impact 
inertia, followed by Li et al. [116] on the soft coalescence (I) at very low 
impact inertia, as shown in Fig. 14a. Consequently, there is a complete 
analogy between droplet-droplet and jet-jet collision for the four major 
regimes of response.
Apart from those parameters shown in Sec. 2 for droplet collision, jet 
collision has an extra parameter representing the jet collision angle α, 
defined as the (half) angle between the two jets, in which the jet velocity 
U can be separated into the head-on and parallel components, U sin α 
and U cos α, respectively, with the normal component bringing the jets 
closer while the tangential component continuously entrains the envi­
ronment gas into the interfacial region.
To be more specific, the nonmonotonic coalescence-bouncing- 
coalescence transition with varying α and U is shown in Fig. 14b. It 
was found that the transition between soft coalescence and bouncing at 
small U is insensitive to α, whereas the transition between bouncing and 
hard coalescence strongly depends on α, with the critical U decreasing 
with increasing α. This is because the coalescence-versus-bouncing 
transition is attributed to the effective head-on impact inertia U sin α. 
A critical α beyond which there is no gas film exists since the two jets will 
always merge in the limit of head-on collision (α = 90◦) [116,117]. 
Furthermore, experimental results suggest that the critical α decreases 
with decreasing Oh.
7. Applications and future work
7.1. Droplet collision in energy applications
Droplet-based two-phase flows are extensively utilized in energy- 
related applications. As examples, we note the application for heat 
transfer enhancement in microchannels [118,119] and in the 
high-temperature heat storage system involving the collision of molten 
salt droplets [120]. The field of biomedicine utilizes droplet regulation 
in microfluidic chips [121,122] at microscale, in which droplets act as 
micro-reactors, controlling the droplet size for inhalation drugs [123] or 
droplet adhesion and rupture behavior for target drugs. In the field of 
chemical engineering, enhanced heat and mass transfer in miniaturized 
droplet reactor systems [124,125] via coupling electric field can sig­
nificant increase the rate of chemical reactions by eliminating diffusion 
limitations. In the field of environmental and climate science involving 
the interaction between multiple droplets in turbulent environment, 
droplet collision efficiency [126] and artificial rainfall enhancement can 
be achieved by regulating the interaction between turbulence and 
charge or seeding hygroscopic particles [127] in clouds to promote 
droplet collision aggregation and coalescence.
In the field of materials and metal additive manufacturing [128], 
where the initial fusion process, the morphological evolution, and so­
lidification between molten droplet and pool play significant roles in the 
material’s mechanical properties. New materials can be formed by 
colliding and merging droplet streams of different constituents [129], 
which could either remain distinct upon merging, form a heterogeneous 
composite, or react and form a new material. Indeed, by manipulating 
the size of the colliding droplets, materials of different properties and 
grain sizes, possibly even with distinct internal structure of the indi­
vidual grains, can be manufactured [130]. Another example is 
multi-color and multi-material electronic and ink-jet printing [131], in 
which droplets of different color/material and luminosity are formed by 
merging two droplet streams of the constituent liquids and sizes.
7.2. Fundamental studies
For future works and potential applications of binary droplet colli­
sions, it is suggested to extend the present review, which mainly focused 
on the fundamental process of binary droplet collisions under initially 
stationary gas environment, to more complex but practical environ­
ments, such as high pressures and high temperatures in practical engine 
conditions, electronic and magnetic fields in engineering spray pro­
cesses, and molten droplet/pool fusion and solidification in additive 
manufacturing.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 111 (2025) 101252

The present review also mainly focuses on collisions in an initially 
stationary gas environment, in which the droplet collision theory and 
modelling in the spray are locally applicable if the droplet collision scale 
is much smaller than the turbulence flow scale. Otherwise, the droplet 
collision behaviors would be influenced by the turbulent flow and non- 
stationary gaseous environment, which requires additional studies.
The droplet collision theory covered in the present review is not 
directly applicable to supercritical droplet vaporization and combustion, 
which merits an independent review in its own right. However, the 
liquid injection into the practical supercritical environment often in­
volves the transition between subcritical to supercritical states and the 
coupling between droplet collision, supercritical droplet evaporation, 
and combustion when the collision time and heat transfer time are on 
comparable scale. The understanding of droplet collision dynamics in 
the present review would be still useful for the coupling between 
subcritical and supercritical spray combustion.
If the multi-component mixture droplets are approximately consid­
ered as a uniform phase, for example the immiscible water-in-fuel 
emulsion droplet [132,133] or the miscible polyvinylpyrrolidone solu­
tion droplet [52,90], the collision behavior should not be much different 
from that of the collision between two pure droplets, except with some 
shifting of the transition boundaries between coalescence, bouncing, 
and separation with the controlling parameters. However, if droplet 
vaporization or combustion are considered, the collision phenomena for 
multi-component mixture droplets could be quite different from pure 
droplets, for example the collision-induced bubble formation and 
micro-explosion [107,108] between two multi-component droplets.
The collision phenomena between two droplets of unequal sizes or a 
droplet impacting on a liquid pool [134–136] should not be funda­
mentally different from that of the collision between two identical 
droplets. The most prominent difference is that the impact mirror 
symmetry is broken by the size disparity showing asymmetric gas film 
drainage process on the small droplet side and the large droplet or liquid 
pool side, leading to some shifting of the transition boundaries between 
coalescence and bouncing, changed gas film rupture position or time 
instant, or different sizes of bubble formation, and inducing some 
modification to define the gas film thickness in the analysis. The colli­
sion between two droplets of very large size ratio is unavailable and 
difficult in existing experimental settings, which merits further studies 
to reveal the approximately infinity size ratio effects on the droplet 
coalescence and separation.
As the developed regime boundary lines for describing various 
collision outcomes reviewed by Sommerfeld et al. [12], and some recent 
advances [8–11,13] in modelling binary droplet collision outcomes 
complete the framework to accurately predict the behaviors of spray 
systems. However, to further accurately predict the behavior of spray 
systems in numerical simulations, a more comprehensive droplet colli­
sion model should be established, by considering both the global energy 
budget perspective during the entire collision process and the local 
force/momentum balance analysis to generate the singularities that 
account for the droplet separation. In addition, machine learning algo­
rithm [137–140] is expected to be powerful for droplet collision pre­
dictions by importing various experimental data to address the 
prediction bottleneck of traditional physical models in strongly 
nonlinear, multi-scale scenarios.
8. Concluding remarks
In this review we have considered the fundamental advances made 
on droplet-droplet collisions since the early 1990s, triggered by the 
recognition that with varying impact inertia and extent of off- 
centeredness, the event could lead to myriad outcomes of permanent 
coalescence, bouncing, and transitory coalescence followed by frag­
mentation of various modes. The underlying physics, globally controlled 
by the thermophysical properties of surface tension and viscosity, ranges 
from continuum fluid mechanics of the impact dynamics, the shape 
distortion and the generated internal motion within the droplet, the 
rarified flow within the interface region, and the inter-molecular van der 
Waals attraction between the interfaces. The essential role of the ther­
mophysical properties is further highlighted with the shear-thinning and 
miscible-vs-immiscible fluids, while the unique phenomena of internal 
jet formation and potential micro-explosion from the trapped internal 
air bubble are noteworthy. The analog of jet-jet collision also suggests 
the application of the understanding gained herein to other impacting 
systems such as the extensively studied problem of droplet impacting a 
liquid pool or film.
We close this review by further highlighting the practical relevance 
of droplet-droplet collisions. First, we note again that droplet collision 
and coalescence can significantly affect the spray statistics, and hence its 
ignition and combustion response, in liquid-fueled engines and burners. 
Second, for rocket engines at high-temperature and high-pressure en­
vironments [5,6] including supercritical conditions [141,142], the 
gradual weakening of the surface tension and enhanced distortion of the 
droplet morphology would significantly affect the collision response. It 
is also noted that atomization of fuels that are difficult to gasify can be 
promoted through trapping of an air bubble upon droplet merging, 
which would induce internal gasification and then micro-explosion. 
Examples of such fuels are hypergolic green propellants with low vola­
tilities [143], and coal and aluminum oil slurries [144] which tend to 
form large particle shells upon depletion of the oil component.
The richness of the elemental phenomena of droplet-droplet colli­
sions is, as such, highly motivating.
