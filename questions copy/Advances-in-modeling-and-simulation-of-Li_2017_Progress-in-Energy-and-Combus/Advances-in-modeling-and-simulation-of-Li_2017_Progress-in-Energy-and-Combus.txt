Li(cid:1)air batteries have potential to be the next generation power sources for various applications, from portable
devices to electric vehicles and microgrids, due largely to their significantly higher theoretical energy densi-
ties than those of the existing batteries. The commercialization of this technology, however, is hindered by a
variety of technical hurdles, including low obtainable capacity, poor energy efficiency, and limited cycle life.
Breakthrough to these barriers requires a fundamental understanding of the complex electrochemical and
transport behaviors inside the batteries. Mathematical modeling and simulation are imperative in gaining
important insight into the mechanisms of these complex phenomena, which is vital to achieving rational
designs of better materials for high-performance batteries. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review
of the latest advances in modeling and simulation of Li(cid:1)air batteries and offer our perspectives on new direc-
tions of future development. Unlike previous reviews that centered mainly on continuum modeling of non-
aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, the present paper focuses on mathematical descriptions of the detailed transport
and electrochemical processes in different types of Li(cid:1)air batteries. We start with a brief introduction to the
working principles of Li(cid:1)air batteries. Then, the governing equations for mass transport and electrochemical
reactions in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries are formulated, including lithium ion and oxygen transport in the
porous air electrode, the formation of solid discharge products, the kinetics of electrode reactions, the evolu-
tion of electrode structure, the distribution of active sites, the effect of the side reactions during cycling, the
phenomena of the volume change, and the charge process. In addition, the mo\deling and simulations of
aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries are reviewed, highlighting the phenomena that are different from those
in the non-aqueous ones. Finally, the challenges facing the modeling and simulation of Li(cid:1)air batteries are
discussed and perspectives for the development of a new generation of Li(cid:1)air batteries are outlined.

1. Introduction

PThe rapid development of advanced electronic devices and electric
vehicles results in a great demand for high-energy-density storage
systems [1]. To date, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are the most
widely used power sources for portable and mobile applications
because of their reasonable energy density, rate capability, and cycle
life [2]. During charge, lithium ions are extracted from a positive elec-
trode material (e.g., a layered intercalation compound LiFePO4 or
LiCoO2) and inserted into or reacted with a negative electrode mate-
rial (e.g., graphite). During discharge, all the electrochemical processes
proceed in the reverse direction [3]. The low theoretical capacity of
the positive electrode materials, however, limits the energy density of
the existing lithium-ion batteries to about 500¡700 Wh kg¡1, which
is insufficient for many emerging applications (e.g., electric vehicles)
[4]. Thus, the exploitation of new energy storage technologies with
much higher energy density is still a grand challenge.

PAmong various emerging energy storage technologies, metal(cid:1)air
batteries have the greatest potential for dramatically enhancing
energy density, especially lithium(cid:1)air, aluminum(cid:1)air, and zinc(cid:1)air
batteries [5]. In these types of batteries, a pure metal is used as the
negative electrode rather than an intercalation compound. Different
from the intercalation reaction mechanism, oxygen enters the
porous air electrode and participates in the oxygen reduction reac-
tion (ORR) during the discharge process. The charge process is the
reversed one through the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to pro-
duce metal and oxygen. As oxygen can be obtained directly from
ambient air, minimizing the required mass and volume of the air
electrode, the energy density of a metal(cid:1)air battery theoretically
relies on the metal electrode only. Among the metal(cid:1)air batteries,
the lithium(cid:1)air (Li(cid:1)air) battery has garnered the most attention,
due largely to the lowest equivalent weight of lithium metal, corre-
sponding to a theoretical energy density of »11,680 Wh kg¡1, which
is close to that of gasoline (»13,000 Wh kg¡1) [6].

PA prototype rechargeable Li(cid:1)air battery was demonstrated by
Abraham and Jiang in 1996 [7], in which a polymer electrolyte

Pcomposed of a lithium salt and carbonate-based solvents was used,
and the reversibility was achieved through the hypothesized forma-
tion and decomposition of
lithium oxides. Since then, many
advancements have been made due to worldwide attention, and var-
ious types of Li(cid:1)air batteries have been proposed and developed [6].
During discharge, lithium metal is oxidized at the lithium electrode
(or anode), producing electrons and lithium ions. Oxygen is reduced
at the air electrode (or cathode) and combined with lithium ions in
the electrolyte to form the discharge product. During charge, the
electrochemical processes are reversed. The discharge product is
electrochemically oxidized at the air electrode, producing electrons,
lithium ions, and oxygen [8]. Notably, the discharge product depends
on the type of electrolytes used in the battery. In aqueous electro-
lytes, the product dissolves first and starts to precipitate when
reaching its solubility. In non-aqueous electrolytes, on the contrary,
the product is insoluble and deposits on the electrode surface from
the beginning. Accordingly, careful design of the air (positive) elec-
trode is vital to the performance of Li(cid:1)air batteries based on differ-
ent types of electrolytes.

PThe development of a high-performance rechargeable Li(cid:1)air bat-
tery requires a profound understanding of the electrochemical and
transport processes, the utilization of suitable electrolyte and elec-
trode materials, and the design of proper battery structures. Tremen-
dous efforts have been made in the recent decade to make Li(cid:1)air
batteries commercially viable. Various electrolyte and electrode
materials have been fabricated and tested [9,10]. The reaction, deg-
radation, and failure mechanisms have been investigated and pro-
posed [11]. Advanced characterization techniques and devices have
been developed and utilized [12,13]. Although some breakthroughs
have been made, the development of Li(cid:1)air batteries is still in the
early stage with many technical difficulties, such as the relatively
low obtainable discharge capacity, poor rate capability, low energy
efficiency, and limited cycle life [11]. In addition to the experimental
explorations, modeling is a powerful and economical tool for under-
standing the working processes, evaluating the material capabilities,
and improving the battery performance [14].

PAn overview of modeling techniques used for battery-related
applications is shown in Fig. 1, which presents the modeling meth-
ods’ relative computational cost (not to scale) versus the approxi-
mate characteristic time and length scales that they can resolve [15].
At the most fundamental level are ab initio molecular dynamics and
ab initio methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which
allow the calculation of reaction pathways and the corresponding
activation energies to predict the stability, electrical conductivity,
and catalytic activity of materials. However, the expense of these
methods depends on the time scales of the electronic structure and
the numerous interactions between atoms and molecules, and the
computing power limits the size of the unit cell to roughly 100
atoms [16]. Molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC)
approaches use predetermined force fields to dictate molecular
interactions instead of detailed calculations of the electronic struc-
ture [17]. Thus, the computational load can be reduced tremen-
dously, allowing the treatment of a considerably larger system of
molecules. Possible applications include the determination of diffu-
sion coefficients and kinetic parameters (MD) or properties of phase
equilibrium like surface tension and vapor pressure (MC) [18]. Dis-
crete element and phase field methods are often used to study the
formation and evolution of grain and microstructure. The transport
phenomena in discrete microstructures may be captured using
methods built upon the Boltzmann transport equation like the lat-
tice Boltzmann method (LBM), which is applicable from free molecu-
lar to the continuum scales and enables the use of a low resolution
and regular mesh [19]. Continuum modeling methods rely on the
conservation equations for mass, momentum, and total energy, such
as species equation, Navier(cid:1)Stokes equations, and energy equation.
These methods are typically discretized using a finite element or

Pfinite volume approach and have a large range of applications such
as studying transport and reaction mechanisms in electrochemical
systems [20]. Generally, the computational cost tends to decrease
with increasing time and length scales [21]. Combining the contin-
uum models at the macroscopic level with high predictive capabili-
ties
toward the material atomistic, chemical and structural
properties (microscopic level) results in a multiscale modeling, and
two strategies are usually used [22]: top-down approach and bot-
tom-up approach. For a top-down approach, a system is broken
down into its compositional sub-systems, each of which is then
refined in greater detail, until the entire specification is reduced to
base elements. While the bottom-up approach is the opposite pro-
cess, in which original sub-systems are pieced together to give rise
to a more complex system. For instance, the electrolyte properties
and the electrode architectures are first determined, and then give
more accurate performance prediction of the battery system. Owing
to the comprehensive scope and information of the battery system, a
multiscale modeling is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms of cou-
pled electrochemistry and transport behaviors as well as shed light
on the methods for performance improvement [23].

PIn the past decade, an impressive amount of review papers about
Li(cid:1)air batteries have been published with focuses on the electrolyte
solvents and salts [24(cid:1)26], electrode materials and structures
[27(cid:1)33], and mechanism investigations [34,35]. For example, Franco
and Xue discussed the scientific and technological challenges for car-
bon-based electrodes from a modeling perspective [36]. Yuan et al.
reviewed the transport governing equations commonly used for
macroscopic continuum models [37]. Li et al. summarized the mac-
roscopic modeling studies and relevant property data for numerical
investigations [38]. These reviews focus on modeling Li(cid:1)air batteries
with non-aqueous electrolytes. However, a comprehensive review
that summarizes the modeling of Li(cid:1)air batteries with other types of
electrolytes, comparing the similarities and differences in modeling,
is still lacking. In addition, the mathematical descriptions about
some detailed phenomena, especially those that are hard to capture
through continuum models, such as the product morphology forma-
tion, the transport through the Li2O2, and the pore structure

Pevolution, have been rarely summarized and discussed. In this arti-
cle, we try to provide a comprehensive review of the latest develop-
ments in modeling and simulation of different types of Li(cid:1)air
batteries. Although ab initio models (e.g., DFT) play a crucial role in
unraveling the reaction routes and selecting suitable materials
[39(cid:1)44], the present paper focuses on models describing the trans-
port and electrochemical processes in Li(cid:1)air batteries. We first
introduce the working principles and challenges of different types of
Li(cid:1)air batteries. Then, the governing equations for mass transport
and electrochemical reactions in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries are
presented in detail, including lithium ion and oxygen transport in
the porous air electrode, the precipitation of the solid product Li2O2,
the kinetics of electrode reactions, the evolution of electrode struc-
ture, the distribution of active sites, the effect of the side reactions
during cycling, the phenomena of the volume change, and the charge
process. Moreover, the similarities and differences in modeling non-
aqueous, aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries are summarized.
Finally, remaining challenges and new directions for modeling Li(cid:1)air
batteries are highlighted and discussed.

2. Working principles of Li(cid:1)air batteries

PBased on the type of electrolyte used, Li(cid:1)air batteries can be clas-
sified into four types: non-aqueous, aqueous, hybrid non-aqueous/
aqueous (or “hybrid” for short), and solid-state Li(cid:1)air batteries, as
schematically shown in Fig. 2. The working principles, important
findings, and remaining challenges are introduced in this section.

2.1. Non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries

PA typical non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air battery consists of a lithium metal
electrode, a porous air electrode with active materials, and an elec-
trolyte made of a lithium salt in an aprotic solvent, as shown in
Fig. 2a. In order to prevent the internal short-circuit between the
lithium metal electrode and the air electrode, a porous separator
(glass microfiber filter or propylene membrane) is usually used
between them [45].

Pexpected [71]. However, various kinds of Li2O2 morphologies have
been observed, from films with thicknesses of several nanometers
[71,72] to large particles of a few hundred nanometres and even
micrometers [73,74]. To explain the formation of different Li2O2
morphologies, Bruce and coworkers proposed two mechanisms: the
solution mechanism and the surface mechanism [75]. In the solution
mechanism, two soluble LiO2 molecules disproportionate to form
Li2O2 with particle-like morphology (Reaction IIIa). In the surface
mechanism, two sequential one-electron transfer steps to yield
insoluble Li2O2 at the electrode surface with film-like morphology
(Reaction IIIb). Hence, the detailed mechanism is governed by the
competition between the LiO2 solubility and the adsorption free
energy of LiO2 on the air electrode. For an electrolyte, both the sol-
vent and the dissolved lithium salt can determine the LiO2 solubility
[76(cid:1)78], affecting the reaction route. When the electrolyte is given,
as different cathode surfaces have different adsorption energies, the
electrode material can thus affect the reaction mechanism as well
[79(cid:1)81]. For instance, an electrode made of reduced graphene oxide
with added iridium nanoparticles is able to stabilize the intermedi-
ate product LiO2, achieving a non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air battery based on
LiO2 instead of Li2O2 [82].

PDuring charge, the decomposition of solid Li2O2 to lithium and
oxygen is needed to make the battery rechargeable. The reaction is
thought to be a direct two-electron process:

Li2O2 ! 2Liþ þ2e¡ þ O2

(V)

and/or a one-electron process involves the formation of LiO2 as:
Li2O2 ! Liþ þ e¡ þ LiO2

(VI)

PDue to the insulator nature of bulk Li2O2 [70], the charge overpo-
tential is surprisingly high (>1.0 V) [12], leading to low energy effi-
ciency. In addition, such a high charge potential can cause the
decomposition of electrolyte and electrode materials, rendering the
irreversible side products, which cover the active surfaces and con-
sequently limit the battery's cycle life [83]. To facilitate the OER pro-
cess, various kinds of catalyst materials have been used in the air
electrode, and improved energy efficiency has been achieved
[84(cid:1)86]. However, the detailed mechanisms of Li2O2 oxidation are
still under investigation [87(cid:1)91]. It is also worth noting that differ-
ent from the OER process in aqueous solutions, the kinetics of the
OER in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries is not only determined by the
electrode materials, but also affected by how the solid Li2O2 is pro-
duced (e.g., morphology, composition), which is correlated with the
ORR process [92]. Hence, the study of the OER process should also
take the ORR process into consideration.

PIn short, the discharge process for non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries is
the formation of solid Li2O2 at the two-phase boundaries between
the electrolyte (liquid) and the active material (solid) in the porous
cathode [93], and the electrochemical decomposition of Li2O2 during
the charge process enables the rechargeability. However, a practical
battery suffers from the low discharge capacity, low energy effi-
ciency, and limited cycle life. Searching for stable electrolyte and
electrode materials, optimizing the cathode structure to improve
transport kinetics, and applying effective catalysts to increase reac-
tion rates are the keys for solving these issues. In addition, most
reported non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries were operated in a pure oxy-
gen atmosphere rather than the ambient air [94] to avoid contami-
nation from other gases (e.g., CO2, H2O), which may cause the
formation of irreversible side products [95], leading to rapid perfor-
mance degradation or even operation failure [96]. In an open atmo-
sphere, how to suppress the evaporation of liquid electrolytes
during long-term operation is another important topic [97,98].
Moreover, due to the crossover of oxygen and other soluble species,
the reactions on the interface between the lithium electrode and the
electrolyte are complicated and result in a severe contamination of
lithium metal [99(cid:1)101]. Consequently, protecting the lithium metal

PIn the early stage, carbonate-based electrolytes (e.g., ethylene
carbonate, EC; dimethyl carbonate, DMC) were applied in non-aque-
ous Li(cid:1)air batteries due to their successful application in lithium-
ion batteries. However, the battery performance was poor with short
cycle life [46(cid:1)48]. It was quickly found that due to the poor stabili-
ties of electrolytes to the formed highly oxidative species [49,50],
the discharge products were irreversible lithium carbonate and lith-
ium alkylcarbonate rather than reversible lithium peroxide (Li2O2)
[51(cid:1)53]. Accordingly, other non-aqueous electrolyte systems with
improved stabilities against superoxide radicals and oxidation
potentials were formulated to ensure longer cycle life, such as dime-
thoxyethane (DME) [54(cid:1)57], tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether
(TEGDME) [58(cid:1)65], and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) [66(cid:1)68]. During
discharge, lithium metal is oxidized at the anode, producing elec-
trons and lithium ions as:

Li ! Liþ þ e¡

(I)

POxygen dissolved in the electrolyte first reduces at the cathode

active surfaces through a one-electron transfer:

O2 þ e¡ ! O2

¡

(II)

PThe formed superoxide ions combine with lithium ions to form
the intermediate product lithium superoxide (LiO2), followed by a
disproportionation reaction:

2LiO2 ! Li2O2 þ O2

(IIIa)

and/or a second one-electron-transfer electrochemical process as:
LiO2 þ Liþ þ e¡ ! Li2O2

(IIIb)

to form the final product Li2O2. The total reaction is
O2 þ 2Liþ þ 2e¡ ! Li2O2 (E0 1⁄4 2.96 V vs. Li/Liþ)

(IV)

PSince Li2O2 is insoluble in the non-aqueous electrolyte, it deposits
on the surface of the porous air electrode and accumulates in the
void volume with an increase in the capacity, and eventually may
block the electrode pores, affecting the transport of oxygen and lith-
ium ion [69]. In addition, due to the insulator nature of Li2O2, it is
believed that the thickness of Li2O2 should have a limitation other-
wise the electron transport will be blocked as well [70]. As a result, a
film-like morphology of Li2O2 covering the air electrode surfaces is

Pthrough suitable membranes or passivation films, as well as solving
the safety issues (e.g., dendrite formation) [102(cid:1)106], are also cru-
cial for practical applications of non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries.

2.2. Aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries

PTo address the issues caused by the solid product Li2O2 in non-
aqueous systems, a new type of Li(cid:1)air batteries based on the aque-
ous solution was proposed by Visco et al. in 2004 [107]. As schemed
in Fig. 2b, an aqueous Li(cid:1)air battery is basically made up of a lithium
electrode and a porous air electrode with an aqueous electrolyte,
and a solid-state membrane in between as the separator [108(cid:1)113].
Different from that in non-aqueous systems where the separator is a
porous structure saturated with non-aqueous electrolyte, the sepa-
rator in the aqueous system is a dense lithium ion conducting mem-
brane (e.g., NASICON-type glass ceramics) so that the lithium
electrode can be protected from the aqueous electrolyte. To avoid
the reaction between the lithium metal and the solid membrane (e.
g., Li1þxAlxTi2-x(PO4)3, LATP) and to facilitate lithium ion transport, a
polymer buffer layer is usually used [114]. Replacing the polymer
buffer layer with a non-aqueous electrolyte leads to a hybrid non-
aqueous/aqueous system [115(cid:1)120], as shown in Fig. 2c.

PThe basic reaction mechanisms in aqueous solutions are general

ORR and OER processes as:

O2 þ 2H2O þ 4e¡ $ 4OH¡

(VII)

PCombining with the reaction in the lithium electrode (Reaction I)

leads to the whole reaction as:

4Li þ O2 þ 2H2O $ 4Liþ þ 4OH¡ (E0 1⁄4 3.45 V vs. Li/Liþ)

(VIII)

PInstead of forming solid Li2O2, the discharge product is lithium
hydroxide (LiOH), which can dissolve in aqueous electrolytes. Hence,
the active surfaces in the air electrode are not affected and a high
power density may be delivered [115]. Besides, electrocatalysts
applied in aqueous solutions can be used to lower the overpotentials
during discharge and charge [9]. However, the solubility of LiOH is
limited to 5.25 M at room temperature, otherwise LiOH ¢ H2O precip-
itates as:

Liþ þ OH¡ þ H2O ! LiOH ¢ H2O(deposit)

(IX)

which results in the similar phenomena as observed in non-aqueous
Li(cid:1)air batteries. The solubility of LiOH can be effectively increased
through the use of lithium acetate salts [109,110], since water acts
as one reactant in the discharge process. However, the amount of
discharge products is limited to the amount of available solvent,
resulting in the lower theoretical energy densities of aqueous/hybrid
Li(cid:1)air batteries than those of non-aqueous ones [121,122].

PIn aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries, an important component
is the solid-state membrane, which not only protects lithium metal
but also transports lithium ions from the anode to the aqueous elec-
trolyte. Hence, a membrane with high stabilities in aqueous electro-
lytes and high lithium ion conductivity is required [110,112,123]. In
addition, for the safety concern, the battery structure should be
robust enough in various operating conditions [111]. Moreover,
searching for inexpensive alternative catalysts to noble metals (e.g.,
Ru, Ir), especially with bifunctional catalytic activities, is an ultimate
target for performance improvement and cost reduction [124,125].

2.3. Solid-state Li(cid:1)air batteries

PThe above-mentioned three types of Li(cid:1)air batteries are mainly
based on liquid electrolytes, which may cause the leakage and safety
issues. A solution is to develop a solid-state Li(cid:1)air battery without
using any liquid electrolytes, as schemed in Fig. 2d. A typical solid-
state Li(cid:1)air battery contains a lithium electrode, a solid-state

Pelectrolyte membrane, and a porous air electrode [126]. The electro-
chemical reactions occur at the triple-phase boundaries among the
solid electrolyte (lithium ion conductor), the air electrode skeleton
(electron conductor), and gaseous oxygen. Similar to non-aqueous
Li(cid:1)air batteries, the discharge product in solid-state Li(cid:1)air batteries
is identified to be solid Li2O2 and the charge process involves its elec-
trochemical decomposition [126], but detailed reaction mechanisms
are still lacking in the literature [127].

PSolid-state Li(cid:1)air batteries have attractive features in better
safety and stability than others with liquid electrolytes. However,
the obstacles for a high battery performance lie in the high lithium
ion transport resistance in the solid-state electrolyte membrane and
limited reaction boundaries among the solid-state electrolyte, the
air electrode, and gaseous oxygen. Till now, various types of solid-
state electrolyte have been proposed and tested, including NASI-
CON-type glass ceramic [127(cid:1)132], single-crystalline silicon mem-
branes [133], and polymer-based membranes [134], while a
membrane with a high lithium ion conductivity is in an urgent
demand. To extend the reaction boundaries, novel air electrode
architectures should also be developed [135].

PAmong the four types of Li(cid:1)air batteries, the non-aqueous sys-
tem has the simplest structure and also shows the high reversible
capacity [136], and thus attracts the most research attention [137].
Since each configuration has specific pros and cons but with definite
scientific and engineering challenges, the ultimate choice for the
best one is still an open question [36]. It should be noted that in dif-
ferent systems, some phenomena are similar. For instance, in both
aqueous and non-aqueous electrolyte, oxygen dissolves into the liq-
uid electrolyte and then transports to the active sites. When the dis-
charge product (Li2O2 or LiOH) reaches its solubility, precipitation
occurs in the porous electrode, leading to decreased amount of the
active sites and an increase in the resistance for lithium ion and oxy-
gen transport. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to conduct
mathematical modeling and simulation to gain important insight
into the mechanisms of these complex phenomena so as to achieve
rational design for performance improvement.

3. Modeling of non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries

PAs introduced in Section 2.1, a typical non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air battery
is made up of a lithium electrode (or anode) and a porous air elec-
trode (or cathode) with a non-aqueous electrolyte, and a porous sep-
arator (not shown in Fig. 2a). However, as the separator is saturated
with electrolyte, oxygen can be dissolved and easily transported to
the lithium metal which consequently cause severe contaminations
[100]. A solution to address this issue is to use an anode protective
layer (APL, e.g., LATP) to block the oxygen crossover as demonstrated
experimentally [138,139]. In the modeling work, the concept of APL
has also been assumed to avoid the complex descriptions of side
reactions occurring on the lithium surface. The computation domain
of a non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air battery is schematically shown in Fig. 3a
[140]. Although lithium dissolution and deposition during the dis-
charge and charge processes are important for the lithium electrode
102,103,141(cid:1)143], as both ORR and OER occur in the porous air
electrode, the transport process inside this electrode considerably
affect the battery performance [144]. Hence, the main modeling
domain is the electrolyte saturated parts, including the porous sepa-
rator (LA¡L) and the air electrode (LC¡L), but the analyses usually
focus on the air electrode. At the lithium electrode/separator inter-
face (x 1⁄4 LA), lithium metal is electro-oxidized to compensate the
consumption of Liþ and electric migration in the electrolyte, while
the oxygen concentration is set to be zero. At the separator/air elec-
trode interface (x 1⁄4 LC), the continuous boundary conditions are
specified for the fluxes of species (lithium ion, oxygen). At the air
electrode/oxygen interface (x 1⁄4 L), the oxygen concentration is esti-
mated from the oxygen solubility and the external concentration

P(oxygen partial pressure), and the flux of each species (lithium ion,
oxygen) is set to be zero. It is noted that there are two types of air
electrodes reported, as schematically shown in Fig. 3b. One type is
an integrated electrode directly made of active materials decorated
substrates/current collector (e.g., nickel form, stainless steel felt)
[145(cid:1)150] with the thickness of 100 ¡ 800 mm. In this case, the air
electrode is homogeneous and is considered in most modeling works
[38]. Due to the low transport coefficients of lithium ion and oxygen
in non-aqueous electrolytes, a non-uniform distribution of species
can be found, resulting in the low utilization of the electrode.
To improve the transport kinetics and the utilization of active mate-
rials, the other type of electrode is composed of a thin active layer
(< 10 mm) on a gas diffusion layer/current collector (>100 mm, e.g.,
carbon paper) [151(cid:1)153] or a porous support (>25 mm) [154,155].
Hence, the real part that participates in reactions is the thin
active layer rather than the whole electrode. In this review, unless
specified otherwise, the term “air electrode” still refers to the
active layer. Since the values of parameters used in modeling can
tremendously affect the accuracy, we focus on introducing the
mathematical descriptions of transport and electrochemical pro-
cesses occurring at the air electrode instead of judging the accuracy
of results. Owing to the low current densities in present non-
aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, the temperature changes are found to be
negligible [156,157] so that the thermal effects are not considered
in the introduced works.

3.1. Lithium ion transport

PIn the early models of non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, the lithium
ion (Liþ) transport was not considered [158,159] since its concentra-
tion in the electrolyte is sufficiently higher (1.0 M) than that of
dissolved oxygen (»10¡3 M) [160,161]. Later on, to develop a com-
prehensive model of non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, the Liþ transport
part was also included [162,163]. This problem is very similar to that
in lithium-ion batteries, for which numerous attempts have been
made to deal with the Liþ transport in the electrolyte. Generally,
three modeling approaches have been developed [36]: i) the coupled
Poisson(cid:1)Nernst(cid:1)Planck equation that treats the transport of cations
and anions as independent [164,165]; ii) the concentrated solution
theory that considers the transport of both cations and anions and
the role of solvent [166(cid:1)168]; iii) the approach based on the electro-
neutrality assumption and a strict convection-free condition [169].
Since the lithium salt concentration in the electrolyte is usually
1.0 M or higher [170], the concentrated solution theory has been
widely used in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries [171(cid:1)173]. In the
porous air electrode, the conservation of Liþ in the electrolyte is

and the electrical conductivity of the electrode, respectively. In sim-
ple dilute electrolytes containing fully dissociated species, the
Nernst(cid:1)Einstein equation can be used to relate conductivity and ion
diffusivity [174,175]. However, this framework does not necessarily
apply to concentrated electrolytes or electrolytes that contain ion
clusters. For example, in the liquid electrolytes consisting of binary
mixtures of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and
perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) with different end groups, some samples
with high diffusivities exhibited low conductivities [176]. This result
indicated that an insightful investigation of the relationship in the
concentrated solution is required.

PHowever, the Liþ transport in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries is dif-
ferent from that in lithium-ion batteries in several aspects. The first
one is that in lithium-ion batteries, Liþ intercalates into the solid
particles across the electrochemical double layer (EDL) region and
then diffuses away. In the concentrated solution theory, although
the strict electroneutrality condition forbids its application to the
EDL region, the high conductivity of the concentrated solution ren-
ders the EDL region to be very narrow, justifying its application in
modeling the electrolyte phase transport in lithium-ion batteries
[36]. In non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, Liþ reacts with oxygen species
to generate the solid product Li2O2 through different routes (Reac-
tions IIIa and IIIb), making the mechanism complex as introduced in
Section 3.3. To capture the detailed kinetics, an explicit treatment of
the EDL region is significant, but related works in non-aqueous
Li(cid:1)air batteries are still absent [177]. The Poisson(cid:1)Nernst(cid:1)Planck
equation may be a useful framework since it allows for the charge
separation to describe the regions close to or inside the EDL of the
electrodes [164,165], but adjusting it to the concentrated solution is
challenging. Second, the electrolyte velocity (Eq. (3)) is usually taken
as zero in modeling without considering the convection effect [37].
While the consumption of lithium metal and the deposition of the
solid product will cause a flow and thus the convection of the elec-
trolyte, which will be introduced later in Section 3.8. Third, due to
the formation of the solid product that affects the air electrode
structure, the effective diffusion coefficient changes during the dis-
charge process, resulting in the coupled lithium ion transport and
reaction kinetics. Besides these aspects, as the electrolyte is a

Pcrucial component in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, some novels
approaches have been reported to adjust the electrolyte properties
for performance enhancement. For instance, room temperature ionic
liquids have been used as the solvents to improve the electrochemi-
cal stability [178(cid:1)180]; mixed solvents were applied to improve the
stability [181(cid:1)183] and change the reaction route [184]; more than
one kind of lithium salts with different concentrations (e.g., 50 mM
LiI and 1 M LiTFSI) were dissolved in the solvent to facilitate the
charge process [185]. In these cases, the electrolytes cannot be sim-
ply treated as binary solutions and the corresponding modeling may
require the development of new theories and methods.

3.2. Oxygen transport

PIn most reported non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, the air electrode
is flooded with the electrolyte [186], as schemed in Fig. 4a [187].
Gaseous oxygen needs to dissolve in the electrolyte first at the air
side of the air electrode (Fig. 3a, x 1⁄4 L) and then transport to the reac-
tion sites. Similar to the governing equation of lithium ion transport,
the conservation for oxygen in the electrolyte is expressed as:
@ðeecO2;eÞ
@t

1⁄4 (cid:1) r ¢ N O2;e þ SO2;e

ð11Þ

where cO2;e is the bulk concentration of oxygen in the electrolyte
which is averaged over the volume of the electrolyte in the pores,
N O2;e is the molar flux of oxygen in the electrolyte. SO2;e is the gener-
ation or consumptions rates of oxygen due to reactions and is rele-
þ according to Reaction IV. The molar flux of oxygen in the
vant to SLi
electrolyte becomes:

where DO2;e is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the electrolyte.

PIn practical non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, due to the limited rate
of oxygen transport in the electrolyte [11], the oxygen concentration
decreases from the air side to the separator during discharge. The
insufficient supply of oxygen near the separator side limits the reac-
tion, causing a large polarization, low utilization of the surface areas
and low discharge capacity [74]. Hence, for a given air electrode,
how to optimize the distribution of electrolyte inside electrode pores

Pfor facilitating the transport of species is a critical issue. It has
been proposed that a wetted electrode is preferred for a battery
[162,188], as schemed in Fig. 4b [187]. In this scenario, all surfaces of
the air electrode are fully wetted by a thin electrolyte layer. In addi-
tion, the channel for gaseous oxygen transport from the air side to
the inner side is maintained so that gaseous oxygen can rapidly pen-
etrate the entire pore and quickly transport to the reaction sites
through the thickness-reduced electrolyte. Since lithium ions are
also present on the surface, all areas can be used for electrochemical
reaction, resulting in an increased capacity [189(cid:1)192]. To describe
this phenomenon, the oxygen transport in the gas channel region
should be considered [193]. The conservation for gaseous oxygen is
expressed as:
@ðegcO2;gÞ
@t

1⁄4 (cid:1) r ¢ N O2;g þ SO2;g

ð14Þ

where eg represents the volume fraction of the gas channel in the
electrode, and Eq. (2) should be rewritten as:

small (usually around tens of nanometer), the gaseous diffusive

molecule to wall collisions as well as molecular diffusion caused by
molecular collisions [194]. The Knudsen diffusion coefficient, DK

can be computed according to the kinetic theory of gases as:

porosity and tortuosity of the air electrode using the Bruggeman cor-
relation as:

Preactors, should be described according to DGM.
In another
research on gas transport in the anode of a solid oxide fuel cell
(SOFC) without considering the pressure effect, the accuracies of
FM, SMM, and DGM were compared [197]. It was found that SMM
is a good approximation of DGM when the pore size is sufficiently
large. However, when typical pore size of SOFC anode is used, the
error of SMM is significant. For a binary diffusion system, FM can
well approximate DGM when the current density is not too large.
When treating the ambient air as a binary system (O2 and N2),
DGM seems not to be a complicated approach. However, a compre-
hensive comparison between FM and DGM for the wetted electrode
in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries is still absent, and further investi-
gation is needed.

PIn the wetted electrode, an expanded interface between the elec-
trolyte and the air ensures a more uniform distribution of oxygen
through the electrode. The oxygen transport resistance through the
electrolyte film to the reaction sites, RO2;e, is expressed as a function
of the electrolyte film thickness de and the oxygen diffusion coeffi-
cient DO2;e as
RO2;e 1⁄4 de
DO2;e

ð20Þ

PThe conservation of oxygen in the air electrode requires that the
consumption rate of oxygen by the ORR is equal to the rate of oxygen
diffusion through the electrolyte film, which is represented by:

cO2;e

a

1⁄4 Rf

RO2;e

ð21Þ

where a and Rf denote the ratio of active surface area per unit elec-
trode volume and a roughness factor of the electrochemically active
area per unit geometric area, respectively.

PThe above-mentioned modeling of oxygen transport considers
both scenarios of flooded and wetted electrodes. In a flooded elec-
trode, the consumption of lithium metal and the deposition of the
solid product will cause a flow of the electrolyte so that the electro-
lyte velocity should be considered in Eq. (12). While for a wetted
electrode, the deposition of the solid product can cause a change of
the electrolyte film thickness, resulting in a moving boundary which
should be carefully addressed. In both kinds of electrodes, the forma-
tion of the solid product alters the electrode structure and the corre-
sponding effective diffusion coefficients. Thus, the oxygen transport
and the electrochemical reaction are coupled and should be solved
simultaneously.

PEqs. (17)(cid:1)(19) are based on the Fick model (FM), while more
complex transport mechanism such as the Stefan Maxwell model
(SMM) and the dusty-gas model (DGM) can also be applied [195].
SMM is suitable for multi-component diffusion, but the effects of
Knudsen diffusion and pressure gradient in porous media are
neglected. For comparison, FM and DGM are more frequently used
for simulating transport in porous media. FM is the simplest model
with analytical solutions for the flux terms, thus it is the most fre-
quently used in fuel cell and battery simulations. DGM is considered
as the most accurate model for porous media transport. However,
DGM usually requires numerical solutions for fluxes and its advan-
tage is significant for multi-component transport. The validations of
FM and DGM in solving the mass transport accompanied by chemical
reactions in porous media were investigated by Veldsink et al. [196].
The results showed that the fluxes of reactants predicted from FM
are in reasonable agreement with the DGM results, but the mass

PThe formation of solid discharge product Li2O2 is a unique feature
of non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, which not only decreases the active
surfaces, but also affects the transport kinetics. The formation of
solid Li2O2 is a complicated process with different reaction routes,
mechanisms, and morphologies, which are closely linked to the bat-
tery performance. Hence, a comprehensive model considering all
these aspects is needed.

P3.3.1. Formation mechanism

PAs introduced in Section 2.1, two formation mechanisms of Li2O2
have been proposed, namely the solution mechanism and surface
mechanism, depending on the LiO2 solubility in the electrolyte and
the adsorption energy of LiO2 on the electrode surface [75]. A kinetic
model has been developed by Nazar and coworkers [198] to describe
the detailed ORR process. As schematically shown in Fig. 5, an equili-
brated process of the adsorption of oxygen on the surface free/active
sites (S) is considered as:

meaning that solution mechanism dominates in the Li2O2 for-
mation. Thus, the effect of non-aqueous electrolyte on the reac-
tion mechanisms can be described. In addition, the ξesc value is
also highly sensitive to current because the current decides the
amount of intermediate species near the surface. At the given
electrolyte and current where ξesc is a fixed value, x(r) is a
function of pore radius so that the relationship between the
product morphology and electrode microstructure can be
described.

PThe results demonstrate that the current density dramatically affects
the product morphology in a very systematic way. Generally, a low
current density results in a high potential and particle-like product,
whereas a high current density leads to a low potential and film-like
product [201]. To accurately model the battery behaviors under dif-
ferent current densities, a clear description of the corresponding
Li2O2 morphology is essential.

PHorstmann et al. developed a nanoscale continuum model for the
initial stages of Li2O2 growth based on a theory of electrochemical
nonequilibrium thermodynamics, as schematically shown in Fig. 8a
[205]. The ORR process (Reaction IV) on a carbon surface is modeled
in (1 þ 1)-dimensional space through the height of the Li2O2 crystal
h as a function of the surface coordinate x. In this way, Li2O2 mole-
cules align in columns growing at the electrochemically controlled
rate @h/@t. The potential of Li2O2 was expressed as:

P3.3.2. Morphology of Li2O2 versus current

PThe above-mentioned modeling works enable the discrimination
of formation mechanisms of Li2O2, and the different morphologies
are qualitatively described through Eqs. (30) and (31). While for a
given non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air battery, the product morphology also
depends on the operating conditions (e.g., current density, tempera-
ture, oxygen pressure) [201(cid:1)203]. Nazar and coworkers investigated
the discharge performance at current densities ranging from
5¡100 mA cm¡2, as shown in Fig. 7 [204]. The discharge overpoten-
tial increases while the overall capacity decreases with the increas-
ing current density. The significant differences in capacity are
correlated to a distinct change in the surface structure: low current
densities in the range of 5¡25 mA cm¡2 give rise to large toroidal
morphologies of Li2O2 (Fig. 7b¡d), whereas the highest current den-
sities of 50 and 100 mA cm¡2 give deposition products on the carbon
that are scarcely visible (Fig. 7e and f), forming the film-like Li2O2.

in which k0 is the rate constant and is determined by Tafel analysis,
ach is the charge transfer coefficient, and g z is the activity coefficient
of the transition state. For galvanostatic discharge, Eq. (34) is solved

PThe modeling results are shown in Fig. 8b. At a very low surface
specific discharge rate (2 nA cm¡2), distinct disc-like particles nucle-
ate and evolve into toroid-like ones. At an intermediate rate
(50 nA cm¡2), small particles are coated on the surface. At a very
large rate (400 nA cm¡2), a film is presented.

PThis model well predicts the experimental observations in the ini-
tial discharge stage. However, how Li2O2 nucleation and growth affect
the shape of the discharge curve or the final discharge capacity has
not been considered. To this end, Lau and Archer took the Li2O2 nucle-
ates and grows as discrete nanosized particles (Fig. 8c) and analyzed
the effect of the current density [206]. First, because the high electrical
resistivity of Li2O2, the current through the Li2O2-covered portion may
be considered negligible compared to the uncovered part. The overpo-
tential could be written using a modified Tafel equation

PThe atomistic theory of electrolytic nucleation was adapted to
model the Li2O2 nucleation kinetics [207]. Solid Li2O2 is regarded to
form through the disproportionation route (Reaction IIIa) with the
nucleation rate:

effective overpotential for this step. The second exponential repre-
sents the effect of overpotential on the rate of adsorption. J0 is the

where Kþ0 is a frequency factor, N0 is the surface concentration of

PDuring galvanostatic discharge, the O2

¡ concentration reaches a
steady state so that the growth rate can be modeled by a constant
flux of Li2O2 at the electrolyte-facing surfaces. For simplicity, the
particle shape is taken to be hemispherical and all particles
are assumed to grow at the same radial growth rate, which scales
with 1=r2
for a fixed amount of Li2O2 precipitate, where rLi2O2
is the Li2O2 particle radius. Under these assumptions, the Li2O2
growth rate can be derived from a simple conservation of current for
a set of non-overlapping particles. As the coverage increases, the
growth fronts begin to overlap, which is described as:

where Vex is the extended volume, Vmax is the maximum volume
defined by the system boundaries, and V is the real volume. Since
the maximum volume is confined by the surface area of the cathode,
the volume fraction V/Vmax can be approximated by the surface cov-
erage uLi2O2 . The real volumetric growth rate is simply derived from
the conservation of current and thus the equation for the radial
growth rate was obtained as:

PWith this model, Li2O2 particle sizes at different current densities
can be estimated. When compared with those observed experimen-
tally, as shown in Fig. 8d, the predicted size is in good agreement
with the experiments. Moreover, the particle size distribution can be
simulated with this model at a low current density, and it is found
that the sharp voltage drop at the end of discharge is caused by an
increased kinetic overpotential due to the coverage of Li2O2 on the
active surfaces.

P3.3.3. Transport through Li2O2

PIn addition to describing the reaction mechanism and product
morphology, understanding the transport process through the solid
Li2O2 is important for analyzing the limiting factor. Three different
transport mechanisms have been proposed, as schematically shown
in Fig. 9 [208].

PThe first mechanism (I) is that Li2O2 growth is controlled by elec-
tron exchange at the discharge-product/solid interface. In this case,
the Li2O2 layer is not compact and can be permeated by the liquid

backbone and the dashed line). Reprinted from [208] with permission of The Royal
Society of Chemistry.

Pelectrolyte. Current exchanged between the liquid phase and the
solid backbone is carried by ion transport through the liquid electro-
lyte within the product layer, and the electron exchange occurs at
the solid surface. Since the electron-transfer site is on the solid sur-
face, the area associated with electron exchange keeps constant as
discharge progresses. As no electron transfer through the Li2O2
layer, the voltage loss due to the electronic resistance (DfLi2O2
) is set
as zero.

PFrom Jung's work, the thickness of the porous deposit layer,

dLi2O2;por, is estimated as [171]:

and thus the species molar concentration at the backbone surface
becomes:

, is estimated by:

ð46Þ

PThe second mechanism (II) is that Li2O2 growth is controlled
by electron exchange at the electrolyte/discharge-product-layer
interface. In this case, the Li2O2 layer is not compact but electron
propagation across it supports electrochemical formation at sites
displaced from the native porous-electrode surface. Hence, the
transport of species in the porous Li2O2 layer is no need to be consid-
ered (Eq. (45)) but the electronic resistance should be considered
as [171]:

ð47Þ

PThe third mechanism (III) is that Li2O2 growth is controlled by
electron transfer through a compact product film, which is also
widely applied in modeling works [38]. This case is similar to the
second mechanism, in which the electronic resistance must be
considered. Based on the specific cathode microstructure [209,210],
different formulas for DfLi2O2
have been given [38], while the key is
established according to Ohm's law as:
DfLi2O2

where sLi2O2 is the electrical conductivity of Li2O2, which is very low
(»10¡19 S cm¡1) [211], dLi2O2 is the thickness of the compact Li2O2

that the conductivity of the Li2O2 thin film decreases with an
increase in the thickness [70], resulting in a fitted power law as
[212]:

ð49Þ

PDue to the extremely high electrical resistance, it is suggested
that the charge transport through Li2O2 at practical current densities
is based principally on hole tunneling [213], and the tunneling cur-
rent through the film can no longer support the electrochemical cur-
rent when the thickness of Li2O2 film reaches »5 to 10 nm [70].
Based on this, Franco and coworkers considered the resistance of
transport through Li2O2 as a decrease of the available surface area
(aava) instead of voltage loss as [214]:

PThe above-mentioned three mechanisms are based on either
porous Li2O2 layer or compact Li2O2 film with electron tunneling as
the main transport mechanism. Siegel and coworkers proposed a
new continuum transport model to explore an alternative scenario,
in which the charge transport is mediated by polaron hopping [215].

where Si is the source term of species i (Liþ, O2) in the electrolyte as

coefficient. Hence, the reaction kinetics is coupled with transport
processes and also changes with time during the whole discharge
region. Wang et al. assumed the exchange current density to be uni-
formly distributed across the cathode and neglected the transient
term, through which they presented an analytical expression of the
total voltage loss with the Damk€ohler number (Da) [216(cid:1)218]. As
the discharge process in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries accompanies
with the solid product deposition, which changes the species trans-
port, reaction kinetics, and surface areas, detailed analyses of the
transient behavior is still needed.

3.5. Electrode structure evolution

PThe solid Li2O2 precipitates in the porous air electrode during dis-
charge, covering the surface and occupying the void volume. From
Reaction IV, the volume change due to the accumulation of solid
Li2O2 can be easily obtained as:

PHowever, the change of surface area is more complicated which
is related to the pore size, pore shape, as well as product morphol-
ogy, and should be carefully treated.

P3.5.1. Continuum models

PUnlike the thick-layer or low-current regime, the overpotential in
the thin-layer limit is asymmetric when the polaron concentrations
at the layer/electrolyte and layer/electrode interfaces are different.

PIn macroscopic continuum models, the effective local surface
area per unit volume of the air electrode due to Li2O2 coverage is
commonly written by a geometric relation as [38]:

3.4. Discharge reaction kinetics

the lithium anode, as

anode and electrolyte interface (ja) can be given by the general Bul-

of p, corresponding to a plate-like morphology as experimental
observations [204].

PUsually, the solid Li2O2 is treated as a compact film covering the
air electrode surface. As the pore structures in the air electrode are
different due to various electrode materials as schematically shown
in Fig. 10 [210], the specific surface area changes from the macro-
scopic view are expressed as:

PAlthough Eq. (63) describes the specific surface area changes for
different pore structures, it is worth noting that the actual pore
structure may evolve during the discharge process. For instance, for
the electrode made of cylindrical nanoparticles (e.g., nanotubes and
nanofibers, Fig. 10c), the effective radius is continuously increasing
because of the deposition of the Li2O2, resulting in an increase in
specific surface area. However, when the deposit layer growth on
one fiber congregates with the growth on adjacent fibers, the struc-
ture changes to the cylindrical pores (Fig. 10a). Hence, a hybrid
model that can correctly capture the structure change is needed
[210].

PIn continuum models, the porous air electrode is usually charac-
terized by porosity, specific surface area, and average pore radius,
and some important guidance can be obtained for performance
improvements. For instance, from the modeling investigation, Li
and Faghri found that the Li2O2 volume fraction gradually decreases
from the air side toward the separator side due to the concentra-
tion gradient of oxygen [27]. Based on this result, they proposed
that a cathode structure with a gradient porosity which is higher
closer to the air side and lower at the separator side can improve
the discharge capacity. This concept was proven to be effective
through experiments [21]. Although the geometrical changes
can be captured through Eq. (63), for a practical electrode with
various kinds of pores, directly using these parameters may result

Pin inaccurate results. Tonti and coworkers prepared four kinds
of porous carbons with the similar specific surface areas and
total pore volumes, namely C233 (596 m2 g¡1, 1.50 cm3 g¡1), C235
(638 m2 g¡1, 1.20 cm3 g¡1), C250 (603 m2 g¡1, 0.85 cm3 g¡1), and
C237 (641 m2 g¡1, 0.55 cm3 g¡1), but with different pore size distri-
bution (PSD), as shown in Fig. 11a and b [219]. When tested in a
battery with an ionic liquid-based electrolyte, they delivered differ-
ent discharge capacities (Fig. 11 and d). In particular, C250 with the
pore radius of 22 nm showed the largest specific capacity, in agree-
ment with the literature that mesopores are the most effectively
used by the discharge product [220]. This result indicated that the
capacity could not be established through a simple correlation
between the specific surface area or total pore volumes. As sche-
matically shown in Fig. 12, when the surface area is mainly contrib-
uted from micropores, a lot of available surface area will be lost if
these pores are clogged by the solid product (shaded area); but this
phenomenon cannot be described using the average pore radius.
Therefore, the pore structure of the carbon materials has a signifi-
cant influence on the discharge capacity. To more precisely capture
the surface area change during the discharge process, considering
the PSD is needed [210,214,221(cid:1)223].

PAssuming the air electrode is composed of spherical pores, the
relationship between the surface area and pore radius is expressed
as [214]:

sider the resistance caused by the compact Li2O2 film, Eq. (50)
should also be combined to describe the electron tunneling
effect.

P3.5.2. Other methods

PThe continuum approach can give good results of the electrode
structure changes from the macroscopic view. However, it may
reach its limit when the investigation scales down to the meso-level
where the collision frequency of species with boundaries (e.g., pores,
channel walls) is comparable with the intermolecular collision fre-
quency. Besides, continuum models use representation geometrical
parameters of the electrode (e.g., porosity, pore volume), while in
reality pores can have different shapes and coordination (number of
interconnections with the neighbors). Such a simplification may
lead to misinterpretation of experimental data and inaccurate
modeling results. Therefore, to detailedly describe the electrode
microstructure, other modeling approaches are required.

(cid:7)

PA three-dimensional (3D) Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model was
developed to describe the coupled transport and reaction processes
inside a pore as a representative of a porous air electrode, as shown
in Fig. 13 [224]. The geometry of the modeled pore is assumed to be
a spherical cavity with two cylindrical channels linking with the
sources of O2 and Liþ, respectively. The radius of the pore, channel,
and the channel length are within the range of 5 to 15 nm. Cubic
meshes are used to build the 3D grid network with the mesh size of
, which is similar to the size of solvated Liþ in DMSO. Four species

that get involved in the electrochemical or chemical reactions (Liþ,
O2, LiO2, and Li2O2) are considered, in which each Liþ or O2 occupies
one grid unit, each LiO2 occupies two adjacent grid units, and each
Li2O2 occupies three grid units (Fig. 13d). The impact of the electro-
lyte on the particles motion and reactions is captured implicitly by
the related kinetic and diffusion parameters. Through this method,
the impacts of geometric parameters, i.e., pore radius and channel
radius, were investigated considering four systems with a pore
radius of 10 or 15 nm combining channels with a radius of 7.5 or
5 nm. Results showed that the enlarged channel was preferred, as
the benefit from the growth of O2 population counteracted and even

Poverwhelmed the loss from the decrease of collision frequency. In
addition, the pore size had an effect on the reaction rate, especially
after the passivation of the channel surface.

PTo probe the effect of precise electrode microstructures on the
battery performance, a pore-scale transport resolved model was
developed by Sun and coworkers [212], which can take any micro-
structure of the electrode and solid Li2O2 as a geometric input. The
microscale computational domain (V) consists of three distinct
phases: electrolyte (V1), electrode (V2), and Li2O2 (V3), and the spe-
cies and charge conservation are given in each domain. Different
from Sections 3.1 and 3.2 where only bulk values (volume-averaged
values) are applied, localized values of concentration and voltage
near the active surface are used in governing equations in each
domain without any approximations regarding the surface quanti-
ties. The effects of cathode nanostructure on the discharge perfor-
mance were investigated through numerical implementation with
an implicit 2D finite-volume method. As shown in Fig. 14a, at the
same electrode surface area (S þ W 1⁄440 nm), different nanostructure
spacings can have different effects on the battery performance.
At a constant height of the nanostructure (H), as presented in
Fig. 14b, the specific discharge capacity increases monotonically
with increasing nanostructure spacing (S), while the discharge volt-
age does not change significantly. In addition to the finite-volume
Jithin et al. employed a multi-relaxation time lattice
method,

PBoltzmann method to solve the multi-physics coupling of transport
and electrochemistry at the pore-scale of a non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air bat-
tery [225]. They generated an idealized electrode(cid:1)electrolyte porous
media from the known macroscopic variables. Then, the mass trans-
port and electrode structure changes due to Li2O2 formation were
investigated. Through the pore-scale model, a detailed electrode
microstructure can be systematically studied [226], contributing to
the understanding of the electrode morphological evolution.

P3.5.3. Multiscale three-dimensional reconstruction

PTo precisely model the discharge behavior, Bao et al. used a mul-
tiscale modeling approach where the mesoscale (10¡1000 nm) and
nanoscale (0.5¡100 nm) features of a real air electrode were cap-
tured by effectively reconstructing its porous structure [227]. The
porosity, surface area per unit volume (a), and pore size distribution
were captured through a Monte Carlo sampling technique, and a
cross section of the reconstructed 3D pore structure is shown in
Fig. 15a, which is a good representation of the real electrode. The
species transports, electrochemical reactions, and electrode struc-
ture evolutions were numerically solved on the reconstructed 3D
mesoscale structure (Fig. 15b). The modeling framework is schemed
in Fig. 15c. The nanoscale model calculates the correlation between
the active surface percentage and the Li2O2 layer thickness in the
nanoscale structure, which is passed along to the mesoscale model

Pto calculate the constitutive relation of a as a function of the aver-
aged Li2O2 concentration in the mesoscale structure. In addition to
the Li2O2 layer, the Li2O2 particles are also considered. The result is
then put into the device-scale model to calculate the discharge
curves. Therefore, this approach offers a reliable guidance to opti-
mize the air electrode microstructures.

3.6. Catalyst distribution

PCatalysts are usually used in the air electrode to improve the
electrochemical performance. As introduced in Section 2.1, the reac-
tion kinetics and reaction mechanisms can be changed due to the
different activities and adsorption free energies of catalyst materials.
However, catalytic sites will become deactivated when passivated
by the solid product. As introduced in Section 3.5, the accumulation
of the solid product can affect the species transport (e.g., O2), and
eventually result in a low utilization of the catalyst sites and low dis-
charge capacity. Hence, understanding the effects of catalyst distri-
bution inside the air electrode is crucial
for the performance
optimization.

PTaylor and coworkers introduced discrete Pd nanoparticles dis-
tributed on the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) nanopore walls to
investigate the effect of catalyst position on mechanistic function, as
schematically shown in Fig. 16 [228]. They found that in both cases
with and without Pd, the discharge product grows from the oxygen
electrode side and infiltrates into the separator side during dis-
charge. In addition, the product morphology transforms from planar
to particulate structures due to the disproportionation reaction
(Reaction IIIa). However, in the case of the AAO membrane without
Pd, isolated partial products remain on the pore walls due to the
inefficiency of the charge reaction. While in the case of Pd-decorated
AAO membrane, the geometrically dispersed Pd catalyst sites result
in uniform migration of the product interface during discharge and
improved kinetics of oxidation, resulting in the improved energy
efficiency and reduced irreversible capacity.

PTo model the catalytically-induced growth of Li2O2 on selected
sites along the pore surface, Ciacchi and coworkers. developed a
model through treating the air electrode as a set of cylindrical pores
with radius rp [229]. The decrease of free pore volume was modified
by a catalytic function catt

PFig. 17a shows that the discharge product grows solely at the cat-
alytic site initially. Once the threshold is reached, growth starts also
at the neighboring sites. Due to the oxygen concentration difference
(oxygen enters the pore from the left), the deposition rate is higher
on the left than that on the right. Consequently, the threshold is
reached earlier at the pore entrance side, leading to an asymmetric
growth profile, as shown in Fig. 17b. Using a greedy algorithm with
the free volume of a single pore after clogging as the objective func-
tion, the number and distribution of catalysts that lead to the mini-
mum free pore volume can be optimized analytically, providing
useful guidance for catalyst decoration along the thickness of the
electrode.

3.7. Side reactions

PIn the discharge process of non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries,
the desired reaction is the formation of Li2O2 as the final product.
However, due to the appearance of superoxide radical anions

P(Reaction II) which are highly active, the decomposition of electro-
lyte and electrode materials generally occur [83]. Even with ether-
based electrolytes (e.g., DME, TEGDME) with improved stabilities,
their decompositions have also been reported with the formation of
side products as lithium carbonate, lithium formate, lithium acetate,
CO2 and H2O [53,230]. Hence, considering the side reactions and
analyzing their effects on the battery performance are meaningful.

PThe modeling of electrolyte degradation and corresponding
cycling behaviors was first reported by Sahapatsombut et al. in
which Li2CO3 was considered as the main side product [231]. Two
mechanisms were proposed for the Li2CO3 formation. The first one
involves the superoxide radical anions as:

tion in the Tafel region and considers the irreversible formation of

[232], so that the other reaction (Reaction XIVc) was considered

PWith these side reactions being considered, the modeling results
for initial ten cycles of a battery are shown in Fig. 18a. The discharge
voltage during cycling was around 2.5¡2.7 V, whereas the charge
voltages increased over time around 4.0¡4.25 V. The increase in
the charge overpotential could be attributed to the loss of active sur-
faces due to the accumulation of irreversible Li2CO3 during discharge
(Fig. 18b), consistent with the experimental observations [234].

PUsing the similar method, the operation in ambient air has also
been modeled considering the low oxygen pressure and the forma-
tion of Li2CO3 [235]. However, when operating in ambient air, in
addition to the proposed side reactions (Reactions XIV¡XVI), the
following side reactions also occur in the air electrode:

where k1 and k2 are the rate constants for the electrochemical
reaction, aCO2 is the transfer coefficient which is given the value as
0.43 § 0.05.

which include not only the electrochemical reactions but also the
chemical reactions to form the solid side products LiOH and
Li2CO3, both are irreversible in the carbon electrode [95,236]. In
addition, it has been shown that H2O has a more detrimental
influence on the battery performance due to the surface passiv-
ation by LiOH [96]. Therefore, to more realistically model the
operating behavior in ambient air, more side reactions should be
taken into account.

3.8. Volume change

PIn non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, a porous separator is usually
applied and the electrolyte is in contact with the lithium anode. Vol-
ume change can occur due to the lithium metal oxidation/reduction
in the lithium electrode and the formation/decomposition of solid
Li2O2 in the air electrode during discharge/change [237], which
affects the electrolyte distribution, resulting in the changes of two-
phase boundaries [188]. In most modeling works, although a solid
separator (APL) is assumed so that the electrolyte is confined in the

which indicates that the effective area for the reaction is also

PIn addition to the electrolyte movement caused by lithium metal
and solid Li2O2, another issue that leads to the volume change is the
electrolyte evaporation during operation, especially for those sol-
vents with high vapor pressure [25]. Huang and Faghri developed a
model to analyze the electrolyte change with including the air cham-
ber that provides oxygen to the battery [239]. The velocity of the
moving electrolyte level (v1) consists of two parts:

PA key finding from this work is that the volume fraction of Li2O2
shows a peak in the middle of the air electrode when the electrolyte
level drops during discharge [239]. This finding is different from the
previously predicted Li2O2 distribution which decreases from the air
side to the inner side, indicating the importance in considering the
electrolyte movement to more realistically predict the discharge
behaviors.

3.9. Charge process

process. In Sahapatsombut's work [140,231,235], the decomposition

Pair electrode, the electrolyte movement due to the volume change of
solid Li2O2 is still seldom considered.

PDutta and coworkers developed a model to account for the
movement of lithium electrode interface during charge and dis-
charge using the moving boundary method [238]. Fig. 19 shows
the interface location of the lithium electrode at the beginning of
discharge and at an instant time t, indicating a change in the
volume of DVLi1⁄4d(t)Scs, where d(t) is the length between the lith-
ium interface and the separator, and Scs is the cross-section area of
the battery (assume anode and cathode share the same superficial
surface area). Considering the conservation of lithium, the volume
change is expressed as:

where MLi, rLi, sLi are the molecular weight, density, and stoichio-

moving coordinate (ξ) is at the reaction interface of the lithium elec-
trode. If the origin of fixed coordinate system (x) is located at the

Pof Li2O2 is assumed to be the reversible process of Li2O2 formation
based on Reaction IV. However, the charge process is much more
complex with various proposed mechanisms [87(cid:1)91], among which
the reversible reaction is seldom reported [82]. Hence, various fac-
tors in the charge process should be considered in modeling.

P3.9.1. Effect of Li2CO3

PLithium carbonates are formed during the working processes of
non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries. In Section 3.7, Li2CO3 is treated as
an irreversible side product that covers the surface areas of the
air electrode, resulting in the capacity fading in cycling [231].
McCloskey et al. found that Li2O2 reacts with the carbon electrode
and forms approximately a monolayer of Li2CO3 at the carbon(cid:1)
Li2O2 interface, while the reaction with the electrolyte forms
approximately a monolayer of carbonate at the Li2O2(cid:1)electrolyte
interface during charge, as schematically shown in Fig. 20a [241].
They developed an electrochemical model to demonstrate the effect
of Li2CO3 on the discharge and charge processes. On charge, the
current associated with the OER of Li2O2, occurring at a low overpo-
tential of about 0.3 V, was given by:

tion, the reaction associated with the oxidation of Li2CO3 was cho-
sen to occur at a high potential of about 4.2 V with the overall
current of:

þ iLi2CO3

PThe modeling results are shown in Fig. 20b, which qualitatively
matches well with the experimental data. The charge potential
depends on the relative surface concentrations of Li2O2 and Li2CO3,
and the existence of one monolayer of carbonate at the Li2O2-elec-
trolyte interface drives the charging potential to be larger than 4 V.
The result indicated that eliminating the formation of this mono-
layer of carbonate at the interface is essential for a low charge
voltage.

P3.9.2. Effect of Li2O2 morphology

PAs introduced in Section 3.3, various kinds of Li2O2 morphologies
have been observed during the discharge process. The impact of
Li2O2 morphology on the charge process has been modeled by
Franco and coworkers [242]. As shown in Fig. 20c, the thin film and
the large particles are set to coexist after discharge, and the thin film
is assumed to be composed of small particles. Both the thin-film and
the large particles are assumed to be hemispherical. In addition, dif-
ferent decomposition mechanisms are adopted for Li2O2 based on
their particle sizes, as presented in the chart of Fig. 20c. For the large
particles (Li2O2(p)), the oxidation starts with the deintercalation of
Liþ from its particle surface to form LiO2-like species (LiO2(s)). Then,
the LiO2(s) is dissolved into the electrolyte in the form of ion pair
(LiO2(ip)), followed by a further oxidation on the electrode surface to
produce Liþ and O2. For the thin film particles (Li2O2(f)), a two-step
decomposition mechanism is adopted to directly form LiO2(ip),
followed by its subsequent oxidation. Because of the very fast
decomposition of LiO2(ip) during the third step of charge, the oxida-
tion of Li2O2(f) can be regarded as a one-step reaction involving
two electrons.

PWith this model, the simulated charge voltage curve is shown in
Fig. 20d, which is a two-step process. During the initial stage of the
charge process, decomposition of small particles takes place, which
continues until its complete removal, and then the decomposition of
large particles starts. This stepwise behavior of the charge curve
implies that small particle oxidation accounts for the lower potential
plateau whereas large particle oxidation is related to the higher
potential plateau, fitting well with experimental results [243].

P3.9.3. Effect of redox mediator

PThe charge voltages for non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries are usually
high, owing to the difficulties in charge transport between solid
Li2O2 and electrode surface. To facilitate the charge process, a redox
mediator (RM) is introduced into the electrolyte. On charge, the RM
is oxidized to RMþ at the air electrode surface as:

RM ! RMþ þ e¡

(XXI)

which in turn oxidizes the solid Li2O2 and results in the regeneration
of RM:

Li2O2 þ 2RMþ ! 2Liþ þ O2 þ 2RM

(XXII)

including tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) [244],

PConsequently, the RM acts as an electron-hole transfer agent that
permits efficient oxidation of solid Li2O2, resulting in the low charge
potential and long cycle life. Until now, various kinds of RMs have
been reported,
lithium
iodine (LiI) [185], iron phthalocyanine (FePc) [245], 2,2,6,6-tetrame-
thylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) [246], indium tri-iodide (InI3) [247],
and lithium bromide (LiBr) [248]. To elucidate the impact of the
major factors of RMs, Janek and coworkers derived an electrochemi-
cal model using TEMPO as an example [249]. The model is restricted
to the intermediate space between Li2O2 and an uncovered part of
the carbon electrode with a constant distance d, as shown in
Fig. 20e. On the steady state conditions, the concentrations of RM
and RMþ at the carbon electrode (x1⁄40) control the electrode poten-
tial by the Nernst equation:

failed in reproducing the particular shape of the experimental charge
curve, implying the complexity of the reaction mechanism for fur-
ther investigation.

3.10. Critical challenges for non-aqueous systems

PAccompanied with experimental findings of non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air
batteries, modeling and simulation have been adopted to under-
stand the working process, predict the performance, and optimize
the electrode and battery structures. We summarized the reported
modeling works in Table 1. The critical challenges facing the model-
ing and simulation are discussed here.

PThe simulation results of lithium ion and oxygen transport in
non-aqueous electrolytes rely on the accuracies of experimental
data, such as the electrolyte properties and the reaction rates. How-
ever, most of these data are lacking in the literature. For instance,
the transport properties (e.g., oxygen solubility, diffusion coeffi-
cient) used in calculations are usually based on carbonate-based
electrolytes (e.g., EC, DMC) [38], which are proven to be unstable
and no longer applied in experiments. Whereas the related proper-
ties of the most widely used solvents (e.g., DME, TEGDME, and
DMSO) have rarely been reported [257], causing difficulties in
quantitatively prediction of the electrochemical performance. To
improve the result accuracies, efforts should be made to character-
izing and measuring these fundamental data.

PFor the solid discharge product Li2O2, a lot of works have
been devoted to revealing its properties. Until now, the reaction
route, morphology formation, and transport mechanism have
been considered. To get a profound understanding of its influen-
ces on the discharge performance, more factors should be
included. First, although the effects of electrolyte properties on
the reaction routes have been modeled, the role of electrode sur-
face in the route determination has not been considered yet. In
addition, the product morphology is usually taken as a compact/
porous film, hemisphere, or sphere in modeling, whereas the
description of the unique toroid-like particles has not been
reported [258]. Besides the current density, the operating condi-
tions (e.g., oxygen pressure) can also alter the product morphol-
ogy [202,203], while their influences have not been modeled.
Moreover, the reported electronic and ionic conductivities of
Li2O2 are not in consistency due to its complex composition and
crystal structure [57], causing difficulties in assessing the limit-
ing factor for charge transport [259].

PDifferent modeling approaches have been used to describe the
structure changes of the air electrode during discharge. A prerequi-
site of the modeling accuracy relies on the accurate geometrical
parameters of the pristine electrode. As carbon materials have been
widely used in the air electrode, their properties (e.g., specific sur-
face area, pore distribution) are sometimes directly used in modeling
[214]. However, the fabrication of the air electrode involves the use
of binders, which may cover the carbon surface and decrease signifi-
cantly the actual surface area [260]. Hence, to precisely capture the
structure evolution, a multiscale three-dimensional model with
actual electrode reconstruction is needed. Because the two-phase
boundaries also depend on the electrolyte distribution [188], the
electrolyte movement has to be included in modeling the transport
and reaction processes.

PCompared with the models for the discharge process, the
works for the charge process are quite limited. The main obstacle
lies in the lack of reaction mechanism [250]. Although the effects
of some aspects, including the Li2CO3 layer, the Li2O2 morphol-
ogy, and the redox mediator, have been considered, more practi-
cal situations should be taken into account [202]. Meanwhile,
the transport process should be coupled with the above-men-
tioned phenomena, such as the electrolyte movement and the
electrode structure evolution. It is noted that although the irre-
versibility of LiOH and Li2CO3 in carbon electrodes has been
demonstrated [95,236], recent studies found that these products
catalysts
might be decomposed with the introduction of

P[261(cid:1)266]. For instance, Ru/RuO2 can demonstrate high activity
towards the oxidation of LiOH [261,262], and NiO can promote
the decomposition of Li2CO3 [263,264]. The influence of catalyst
and the corresponding novel mechanisms during the charge pro-
cess should be further included in modeling.

PIn most non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, diffusion dominates in the
transport mechanisms. To improve the transport kinetics, some
novel structures have been developed. For instance, a non-aqueous
Li(cid:1)air flow battery with the transport domination of convection has
been reported [267(cid:1)269], and the corresponding analyses have also
been made [270,271]. However, to estimate the whole battery sys-
tem, a comprehensive model incorporating the energy consumption
through the pump or flow field should be presented, instead of ana-
lyzing the performance improvement in the air electrode only.

4. Modeling of aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries

PAs shown in Fig. 2b and c, a typical aqueous/hybrid Li(cid:1)air
battery is made up of a lithium electrode, a porous air electrode
with an aqueous electrolyte (water as the solvent), and a dense
lithium ion conducting membrane as the separator. A buffer
layer (for aqueous) or a non-aqueous electrolyte (for hybrid) is
filled between the lithium metal and the solid membrane. At the
active surfaces of the air electrode, oxygen and water electro-
chemically react to form hydroxide ions (OH¡). At the lithium
metal electrode, lithium ions are electrochemically formed, pass-
ing the lithium ion conducting membrane and dissolving in the
electrolyte. Lithium hydroxide monohydrate particles will nucle-
ate when the ion concentration increases sufficiently beyond its
solubility limit (Reaction IX). When analyzing the transport pro-
cess, as both ORR and OER processes occur in the air electrode,
the key modeling domain is still the porous air electrode. Differ-
ent from non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries in which the air electro-
des are generally flooded by the liquid electrolytes, in aqueous
and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries gaseous oxygen and liquid electrolyte
may coexist in the air electrode due to the hydrophobic binders
(e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE) and carbons (e.g., Ketjen
black) [118], as schematically shown in Fig. 21 [272]. When esti-
mating the battery voltage, due to the low ionic conductivity of
the solid-state membrane and the high contact resistance [24],
the modeling domain is extended to the whole battery. In Sec-
tion 3, we have introduced the models for non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air
batteries in detail. So in this section, we will omit the duplicate
process but emphasize the different electrochemical phenomena.

4.1. Air electrode coexisted with liquid electrolyte and gas

PDifferent from non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries where most organic
solvents can flood PTFE and the carbon electrode pores [273], the
hydrophobic materials in the air electrode results in the coexistence
of liquid electrolyte and gas in aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries
(Fig. 21). Hence, the description of the phase states in the air elec-
trode is essential for the following modeling works.

PHorstmann et al. tracked the states of the coexisting phases
through macroscopic parameters and balanced their pressures with
an empirical coarse-grained approach [272]. The volume fraction (e)
depend on the pressures (P) of the phase, and only liquid and gas are
considered to depend on pressures. Hence, Eq. (101) represents a
condition for the pressures of the gas phase Pg and the liquid phase
Pe. In the hydrophobic environment, the aqueous phase has a larger
pressure than the gaseous phase, which is analogous to regular cap-
illary depression with the empirical law as:
Pcap 1⁄4 Pg (cid:1) Pe 1⁄4 (cid:1) JðsaÞ
ð101Þ
where J(sa) is the Leverett function and sa1⁄4 ee(ee þeg) ¡1 is the satu-
ration of the liquid phase in the free pore space. The equation of state
eg is given by the ideal gas law:
PgVg 1⁄4 NgRT
and the equation of state ee is:

which follows from basic thermodynamics valid for any phase. The
partial molar volume of species i contains the partial molar volume
V at standard pressure P0 and the partial molar compressibility k as:

ð104Þ

PIn this method, details of the complex pore network containing
hydrophilic/hydrophobic and microscopic/mesoscopic pores are
neglected. To more precisely describe the air electrode, Gr€ubl et al.
applied the Lattice(cid:1)Boltzmann method (LBM) to describe two-phase
flow on the pore-space domain considering the wetting properties of
multiple solid materials [274]. 3D reconstructions of a model elec-
trode were first employed [20], in which the binder phase was
reconstructed using a random walk algorithm on the particle sur-
face. Simulations were then performed using unity density and vis-
cosity ratio. The calculated capillary pressure of the simulation

cap was rescaled according to:

1ðluÞ
Dx

DPLBM

ð105Þ

cap

st

Pwhere sst and sLBM
are the surface tension of the real fluids and
simulation, respectively. Dx is the one lattice unit (lu) and is
determined by the reconstructed electrode geometry. In experi-
mental studies, the capillary pressure/saturation characteristics
are typically measured during the dynamic imbibition and drain-
age of the liquid phase. These two processes are possible to be
mimicked by a suitable choice of initial conditions. For instance,
for the simulation of the drainage process, it can be assumed that
the electrolyte preferentially remains on the hydrophilic elec-
trode surface.

PThe results of 3D LBM simulations are presented in Fig. 22. An
exemplary distribution of liquid electrolyte at a saturation of 60% in
fluid mechanical equilibrium is shown in Fig. 22a. The final distribu-
tion can be used for the calculation of the diffusivity in the gas and
liquid phase at varying saturation. From the results in Fig. 22b, the
liquid phase diffusivity consistently increases with saturation as the
tortuosity of transport pathways decreases. While at low satura-
tions, more and shorter transport pathways are available for the gas
phase. The saturation behavior of the air electrode and correspond-
ing effective transport properties are important input parameters
for further simulations.

4.2. Species transport

PDifferent from the scenario in non-aqueous electrolyte in which
the total number of anions and cations remains constant during dis-
charge, in aqueous electrolytes the Liþ and OH¡ concentrations
increase with the discharge process until reaching the saturation of
(cid:1) 3mol cm(cid:1) 3). In addition, the poros-
LiOH in water (csat
Li
ity of the air electrode remains constant before saturation, but
decreases afterward due to the precipitation of LiOH ¢ H2O. The oxy-
gen transport can be described through the similar approached
introduced in Section 3.2, but the lithium ion transport should be
carefully addressed considering these different characters.

þ 1⁄4 5:17 (cid:8) 10

P4.2.1. Before saturation

PThe transport of lithium ions can be basically described using the
similar equations in non-aqueous electrolytes. Due to the different
reaction mechanism, the relationship between SLi
þ and SO2;e is con-
verted according to Reaction VII. It is worth noting that in aqueous
electrolytes, the Liþ concentration increases with the discharge pro-
cess and can reach the value at saturation as high as 5.25 M. At low
Liþ concentrations (e.g., initial discharge stage), the dilute solution
theory should be used in modeling. The current density il is [275]:

PHere the relationship between the conductivity and ion diffusiv-
ity can be in principle established by using the Nernst(cid:1)Einstein
equation [174,175], different from that in Eq. (4). At higher Liþ con-
centrations (e.g., 1.0 M), the concentrated solution theory should be
applied using the similar equations as introduced in Section 3.1.
Since the formed product is soluble in the electrolyte, the porosity of
the cathode remains constant. However, the solvent (water) is con-
sumed according to:

dmH2O
dt

1⁄4 (cid:1) IappMH2O

2F

ð107Þ

where MH2O is the molecular weight of H2O, mH2O is the amount of
water. As a result, the concentrations of species (Liþ and OH¡)
change during the discharge process due to the electrochemical
reaction and the consumption of water. Hence, the transport coeffi-
cients should be updated due to the changed concentrations.

P4.2.2. After saturation

Paqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries, when the lithium ion concen-
tration increases sufficiently beyond the solubility limit, small
stable crystal clusters nucleate and start to grow (Reaction IX). The
nucleation of seed crystals and the subsequent growth of LiOH ¢ H2O
were modeled by Horstmann et al. using the classical theory of
nucleation and growth [272]. The reaction enthalpy of formation of
a single crystal nucleus of size n consists of a bulk and a surface
term:
DG 1⁄4 DGbulk
1⁄4 (cid:1) n2kT lnSr þ AðnÞg s
ð113Þ
where A(n) is the surface area of LiOH ¢ H2O nucleus, g s is the macro-
scopic surface energy and the factor of 2 arises for a binary salt. The
supersaturation ratio Sr 1⁄4 cLi
þ is the driving force for nucleation.
For larger nucleus sizes the bulk energy is increasingly negative,
whereas the surface energy is increasingly positive. To grow in a sta-
ble way, crystal clusters must exceed a critical size. In the case of
heterogeneous disc-shaped nucleation, the critical formation energy
is expressed as [276]:

þ DGsurface

þ =csat
Li

PWhen reaching the saturation of LiOH in water, precipitation of
LiOH ¢ H2O occurs according to Reaction IX. First, the equation for the
lithium transport is slightly modified to consider the Liþ and OH¡
consumption due to precipitation (PrLi

@t

þ þ PrLi

and the concentrated solution theory should be applied. Second,
because water is also consumed during the precipitation process,
Eq. (107) is modified to:

2F

ð109Þ

1⁄4 (cid:1) 3IappMH2O

dmH2O

PAfter saturation, the discharge product LiOH ¢ H2O decreases the
local volume in the air electrode. The volume fraction of electrolyte
changes as:
@ee
@t
where MLiOH and rLiOH are the molecular weight and mass density of
deposited LiOH ¢ H2O, respectively. ns is the number of moles of LiOH

PIn aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries, the solvent (water) trans-
port is a major issue for two reasons [272]: First, water is consumed
during discharge, making a constant flux of water into the GDE nec-
essary. Second, in the GDE with the phase coexistence of gas and
liquid, a pressure gradient drives water transport. The electrolyte
velocity should also be considered, which is determined from Dar-
cy's law as:

and the gas velocity obeys the analogous equation as:

4.3. Nucleation and growth of LiOH ¢ H2O

PIn Section 3.3.2, the nucleation and growth of solid Li2O2 in
non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries have been modeled to determine the
resultant surface coverage [206]. In contrast to the situation that
the solid Li2O2 deposits in the air electrode from the beginning, in

is predicted by the bulk diffusion model at large supersaturation

PWhen applying Eqs. (115) and (116) in aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air
batteries, two cases were considered in Horstmann's work [272].
The first one is that nucleation occurs on the surfaces of the air elec-
trode (Fig. 21). The disc-shaped heterogeneous nucleation was
assumed to be valid for nucleation on crystal material itself. The area
supporting the nucleus evolves as:
@a

where a is the surface area per unit electrode volume, rcrit is the criti-
cal radius, and Ns 1⁄4 a0=L2
LiOH ¢ H2O. LiOH ¢ H2O can subsequently crys-
tallize on top of these discs according to Eq. (116), where a constant
diffusion layer thickness ddl is assumed to be determined by the
pore structure. The crystal growth is described with a single volume
fraction:

PThrough this approach, the nucleation and growth of column-

shaped precipitations in the air electrode can be simulated.

PThe other case is that a reservoir of pure electrolyte is applied
between the solid membrane and the air electrode, as schematically
shown in Fig. 2b. In this liquid reservoir, the crystal nuclei sediment
due to gravity and form a reservoir of precipitations at the bot-
tom [278]. Under this condition, crystal nuclei of different sizes can
coexist [279], and the size distribution of spherical crystal nuclei
was described as:

PThis approach expands the precipitation area to the whole region
of the battery with the aqueous electrolyte. Actually, this phenome-
non was also observed in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries in which
solid Li2O2 particles were coated on the glass fiber separator that sat-
urated with the liquid electrolyte [204]. Hence, although in non-
aqueous and aqueous systems the solid products are formed from
different mechanisms, they may share some similar nucleation and
growth characters. Developing a general approach to describe these
processes, therefore, is in great need for future modeling work.

4.4. Performance estimation

P4.4.1. Power density

PAlthough the discharge process of aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air bat-
teries has two regimes and may introduce complex transport issues
as those in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, the unique feature of the
aqueous-based batteries is that the air electrode structure does not
change in the first regime. Hence, if the battery structure is well
designed with refreshing the electrolyte [122], the second discharge
regime may be avoided so that a stable power can be delivered.
Andrei and coworkers developed a model to predict the maximum
theoretical power density [281] of aqueous-based Li(cid:1)air batteries,
from which the battery voltage (Vbat) was written as:

Vbat

1⁄4 E0 (cid:1) ha

(cid:1) hc

ð124Þ

Pwhere RSep is the resistance of the separator including the separator-
anode and separator-cathode interfaces, R0 is the combined resis-
tance of the electrolyte, electrons, and contacts.

PThe overpotential at the anode was obtained through setting the

charge transfer coefficient b as 0.5 to obtain:

where sinh¡1 is the inverse sinh function. To obtain a closed-form
solution for the cathode overpotential, the cathode reaction is
assumed to be limited by oxygen diffusion due to the slow oxygen
diffusion coefficient. Considering the steady-state one-dimensional
mass transfer along the cathode thickness (LCat) and setting the
charge transfer coefficient as 0.5, the overpotential at the cathode
was obtained as:

where pO2 is the outside partial pressure of the oxygen.

PThe resistance of the separator can be written as the sum of the
bulk resistance of the separator (Rbulk) and the resistances of the sep-
arator/anode (RSA) and separator/cathode (RSC) interfaces:
RSep 1⁄4 Rbulk

PThe validation of this model is made by comparing the theoreti-
cal predictions of the voltage and power of the battery with experi-
mental data [115], which shows good agreement
(Fig. 23a).
Because the oxygen diffusion coefficient is expected to become a
limiting factor for achieving high power density, the maximum
power density as a function of the oxygen diffusion coefficient and
partial pressure can also be analyzed, as presented in Fig. 23b. A
ten-fold increase in pO2 results in a slightly better improvement on
power density than a ten-fold increase in DO2;e. This result indicates
that to achieve higher power densities, decreasing the internal
ohmic losses, especially those caused by the solid-state electrolyte
membrane, is needed.

P4.4.2. State of charge

PAlthough the first discharge regime (dissolved LiOH discharge
product) can yield a high power density, the second discharge
regime (solid LiOH ¢ H2O discharge product) can yield a high specific

et al. defined the state of charge (SOC) in the first regime as the con-
centration of dissolved LiOH relative to its solubility limit (csat

PBesides the solubility of oxygen, other properties such as the
electrolyte density, the diffusion coefficient, and the ionic conductiv-

empirical equations or data fitting [272]. In addition to considering
the transport and kinetics changes in the air electrode, an important
feature for aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries is that temperature
can tremendously affect the ionic conductivity of the solid-state lith-
ium ion conducting membrane [284]. Thus, the performance at high
temperatures, including the discharge capacity, cell voltage, and the
power density, should be carefully addressed through taking this
into account [285].

4.5. Temperature effects

4.6. Critical challenges for aqueous systems

PAs shown in Fig. 24a, the solubility of LiOH in water increases
apparently with temperature, indicating that a higher operating
temperature can lead to a longer first discharge regime. In the sec-
ond regime, the surface energy of LiOH ¢ H2O was taken from the the-
oretical prediction as [282]:

batteries, the corresponding modeling works are also limited, as
listed in Table 2. Due to the two regimes during discharge, aqueous
and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries share some similar features of alkaline
fuel cells and non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, so that some well-devel-
oped theories and models can be adopted. Even so, some unique
aspects are worth attention, and the critical challenges are shown
below.

Pboth gas and liquid electrolyte coexist in the electrode. Various
approaches have been applied to describe the phase states, while
more precise results are in the great demand for further analyses.
Different from the wetted electrode in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries,
the electrolyte solvent (water) in aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batter-
ies also participates in electrochemical reactions. In the first dis-
charge regime, although the electrode structure does not change,
the total amount of liquid electrolyte solvent decreases due to the
consumption of water. In the second regime, both the electrochemi-
cal consumption and the solid product precipitation change the dis-
tribution of the electrolyte inside the electrode. The electrolyte
movement not only introduces convection into the transport mecha-
nisms, but also continuously changes the phase states inside the air
electrode, resulting in a complex moving boundary problem.

PSecond, the transport and reaction kinetics during discharge
should be well addressed. In non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries, atmo-
spheric oxygen molecules dissolve first into the non-aqueous elec-
trolyte, and then are reduced at the two-phase boundaries. While in
aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries, the coexisted liquid electrolyte
and gas may enable the electrochemical reactions to occur at the tri-
ple-phase boundaries among gaseous oxygen (gas), electrolyte (liq-
uid), and active material (solid) [93]. Although in some reported
modeling works only dissolved oxygen was considered [275], a
detailed description of the transport and reaction processes among
different phases is essential for a practical air electrode.

PThird, the electrolyte components are complex in practice. In
modeling works, the electrolyte is usually taken as a binary solution
(LiOH solution). To improve the theoretical specific capacity and
energy density, acid solutions such as HCl and HClO3 with a high sol-
ubility of discharge products may be applied [122]. In addition, as
the aqueous electrolytes with high or low pH can cause stability
issues of the solid-state electrolyte membrane [114,288], some
buffer additives are used in the aqueous electrolytes [289,290]. As a
result, the electrolyte is no longer a binary solution but with com-
plex anions and cations.

PFourth, the solid discharge product, LiOH ¢ H2O, receives little
attention. In the second discharge regime, the precipitation of LiOH ¢
H2O occurs, which is similar to the formation of solid Li2O2 in non-
aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries. In modeling works, the nucleation and
growth of LiOH ¢ H2O have been considered [272], and the corre-
sponding influence on the electrode structure has also been analyzed
[275]. However, the morphology of the precipitation is usually taken
as a disc or a sphere, while the actual formation of more complex
morphologies, along with the corresponding influences on the elec-
trode microstructure (e.g., pore size, shape, and distribution) and the
transport kinetics, have been rarely considered in modeling. Besides,
the relationship between nucleation and surface conditions (e.g.,
with or without catalysts) has few been investigated [286]. To give a
better description of this phenomenon, more experimental works
with advanced characterization techniques are required.

PFifth, the charge process has not been modeled yet. Although the
charge performance of aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries has been
investigated experimentally [124,291], no relevant modeling works
have been conducted. To describe the charge process, a lot of aspects
should be considered, including the catalytic activities, transport
kinetics, etc. Moreover, the charge process started from the solid
LiOH ¢ H2O involves its dissolution with the formation of water, caus-
ing another moving boundary issues and aggravating the modeling
complexity.

PLast but not least, analyses on novel aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air
battery systems are important. To facilitate the transport kinetics, a
new Li(cid:1)air flow battery system has been proposed and experimen-
tally demonstrated [292]. Model is a powerful tool in evaluating the
feasibility of different battery structures and concepts [287]. How-
ever, it is worth noting to evaluate the feasibility of a new battery
structure, not only the performance improvements but also the extra

Penergy consumptions due to the introduction of new components (e.
g., the energy consumption of the pump for a flow system) should be
considered in a system level [274].

5. Summary and outlook

PLi(cid:1)air batteries have potential to be the next generation of power
sources for many emerging technologies due largely to the high the-
oretical energy density. To commercialize this promising technology,
tremendous efforts have been devoted to overcoming the technical
hurdles through experimental and computational approaches. In
this paper, we have reviewed the latest developments in modeling
and simulation of different types of Li(cid:1)air batteries. Unlike previous
reviews that focused mainly on the continuum models, we center on
the modeling and simulation of the detailed physical, chemical, and
electrochemical phenomena associated with the discharge and
charge processes. We have outlined the modeling descriptions of
various transport and reaction processes in non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air bat-
teries, including the lithium ion and oxygen transport in the porous
air electrode, the formation mechanism, morphology, and transport
of the solid product Li2O2, the kinetics of electrode reactions, the
evolution of electrode structure, the distribution of active site, the
side reactions, the volume change phenomena, and the charge pro-
cess with considering the effects of Li2CO3, Li2O2 morphology, and
redox mediator. Undoubtedly, substantial challenges still remain for
modeling non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air batteries as we summarized in Section
3.10. The modeling works of aqueous and hybrid Li(cid:1)air batteries,
especially the phenomena that different from the non-aqueous ones,
have also been reviewed. The unique aspects that worth attention
and the critical challenges are also discussed in Section 4.6. To
develop more powerful predictive models that can be used for ratio-
nal design of high-performance Li(cid:1)air batteries, attention should be
paid particularly to the following areas:

PFirst, a better understanding of the reaction kinetics on the sur-
face of porous air electrodes is needed. For non-aqueous Li(cid:1)air bat-
teries, although detailed descriptions have been proposed for
different reaction steps and routes during discharge (Section 3.3.1),
a simplified overall reaction has always been used (Section 3.4)
when considered together with the transport processes, which may
result in inaccurate results. During charge, the related modeling
descriptions are quite limited due to the lack of detailed reaction
mechanisms. Similar scenarios exist in modeling aqueous and hybrid
Li(cid:1)air batteries, with less detailed reaction steps being taken into
account. For solid-state Li(cid:1)air batteries, unfortunately, the related
modeling and simulation are not yet reported in the literature, due
largely to the lack of reaction mechanisms, especially the formation
and growth mechanism of the solid product Li2O2 in an all-solid-
state battery system. In addition, most reported modeling works
have only considered the ORR and OER processes. When operating
in ambient air, the other gases and contaminants encountered in
ambient air may participate in the reactions and lead to side prod-
ucts; their corresponding influences on the battery performance
should be further investigated.

PSecond, the reliability and accuracy of the input parameters are
essential for predictive modeling and simulation. The values of
many parameters may critically affect the predicted performance of
Li(cid:1)air batteries, including the electrolyte properties (e.g., oxygen
solubility, lithium ion conductivity), the electrode geometries (e.g.,
specific surface area, porosity, pore size distribution), and the reac-
tion kinetics (e.g. reaction rate constant). However, some of these
parameters are often unavailable or incomplete, limiting the accu-
racy in prediction and evaluation of battery performance. Efforts
should be devoted to advancing characterization and measurement
techniques in order to provide accurate values for these important
parameters.

PThird, a comprehensive modeling of the whole battery system is
required. Most reported models focus mainly on the reactions occur
in the air electrode. To assess the performance of the whole battery
system, the behavior of the lithium electrode should also be
included, considering the lithium dissolution and deposition pro-
cesses with possible dendrite formation and growth. In addition,
temperature effects are usually ignored when the current densities
are relatively low. However, for Li(cid:1)air batteries or cell stacks of large
power, thermal management could become critical to battery per-
formance, such as start-up in cold areas. Thus, thermal transport and
temperature distribution may have to be taken into consideration.
Moreover, the mass flow (e.g., air) arrangement may also affect bat-
tery performance. A comprehensive model considering all battery
components and the effects of operating conditions (e.g., current,
temperature, air flow) is required in the performance assessment
and optimization.

PFourth, multiscale and multiphase modeling, in which the physi-
cochemical processes occur in different scales and different phases
can be solved simultaneously, is in great need. With the develop-
ment of modeling technology, the transport and electrochemical
processes from micro to macro scale and the detailed phase transi-
tion in Li(cid:1)air batteries can be taken into consideration. With the
help of experimental validation, predictive models can be used to
optimize a specific design and tune the operating conditions for
improved performance.

PThese advances will not only accelerate the development of
Li(cid:1)air battery technologies, but also provide useful guidance for bet-
ter designs of other electrochemical energy systems such as lith-
ium(cid:1)sulfur batteries and sodium(cid:1)air batteries.
