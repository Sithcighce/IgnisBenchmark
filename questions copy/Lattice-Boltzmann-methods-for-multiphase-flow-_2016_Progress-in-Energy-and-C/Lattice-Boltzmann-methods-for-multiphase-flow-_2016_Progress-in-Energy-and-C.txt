Over the past few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the development of particle-based
discrete simulation methods versus the conventional continuum-based methods. In particular, the lattice
Boltzmann (LB) method has evolved from a theoretical novelty to a ubiquitous, versatile and powerful
computational methodology for both fundamental research and engineering applications. It is a kinetic-
based mesoscopic approach that bridges the microscales and macroscales, which offers distinctive advantages
in simulation fidelity and computational efficiency. Applications of the LB method are now found in a
wide range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials, biomedicine and various branches of
engineering. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the LB method for thermofluids and
energy applications, focusing on multiphase flows, thermal flows and thermal multiphase flows with phase
change. The review first covers the theoretical framework of the LB method, revealing certain inconsis-
tencies and defects as well as common features of multiphase and thermal LB models. Recent developments
in improving the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consistency, reducing spurious currents, enhancing
the numerical stability, etc., are highlighted. These efforts have put the LB method on a firmer theoretical
foundation with enhanced LB models that can achieve larger liquid-gas density ratio, higher Reynolds
number and flexible surface tension. Examples of applications are provided in fuel cells and batteries,
droplet collision, boiling heat transfer and evaporation, and energy storage. Finally, further develop-
ments and future prospect of the LB method are outlined for thermofluids and energy applications.

1. Introduction

Energy and combustion systems typically involve fluid dynam-
ics, chemical reactions, heat transfer, multiphase flows and phase
change that occur over scales ranging from macroscale via me-
soscale to microscale. Extensive examples are found in batteries,
fuel cells, gas turbines, fluidized beds, coal-fired power plants,
solar thermal power plants and nuclear power plants. The perfor-
mance, reliability and safety of these technologies depend crucially
on how to organize the fundamental thermal-fluids processes,
which in turn requires accurate and reliable predictive and diag-
nostic methods. Since the 1970s, general-purpose computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) based on solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–
Stokes (RANS) equations, pioneered by D. B. Spalding and others,
has been developed to compute fluid flow, heat transfer and com-
bustion with considerable success. With the emergence of
supercomputers in the 1990s, more accurate but computationally
demanding methods such as large eddy simulation (LES) and direct
numerical simulation (DNS) have been in increasing use. These
macroscopic methods, however, are all based on the assumption
of continuum, which makes it difficult or even impossible to
treat certain physical phenomena, especially at micro- and
meso-scales.

More fundamental approaches are particle-based (i.e. molecu-
lar cluster-based) discrete methods, such as molecular dynamics (MD),
direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), and dissipative particle dy-
namics (DPD). These methods are capable of simulating phenomena
where the continuum assumption breaks down. On the other hand,
the high computational cost renders these methods impractical for
the majority of problems of practical concern in energy and com-
bustion. The lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, sitting in the middle
of the hierarchy of modeling and simulation methods (see Fig. 1),
is a mesoscopic approach based on the kinetic theory expressed by
the original Boltzmann equation. The LB equation can be either viewed
as a special discrete solver for the Boltzmann equation or a minimal
form of the Boltzmann equation in which the microscopic kinetic
principles are preserved to recover the hydrodynamic behavior at

the macroscopic scale [2]. Therefore, the LB method is based on a
particle picture, but principally aims to predict macroscopic prop-
erties [3]. This scale-bridging nature of the LB method is a fundamental
advantage, which allows it to incorporate the essential microscop-
ic or mesoscopic physics while recovering the macroscopic laws and
properties at affordable computational cost.

In the last 25 years, the LB method has been developed into an
efficient and powerful simulation method for a wide range of phe-
nomena and processes [1–16], such as single-phase flows, multiphase
flows, turbulence, heat transfer, and phase change, as well as a nu-
merical tool for nonlinear partial differential equations [17–22]. It
exhibits many distinctive advantages over conventional numeri-
cal methods [3,23]. First, in the LB equation the convective operator
(the streaming process) is completely linear, whereas the convec-
tive terms of the Navier-–Stokes equations are nonlinear. Second,
in conventional numerical methods it is usually necessary and costly
to solve a Poisson equation for the pressure field of incompress-
ible flows, while in the LB method the fluid pressure can be simply
calculated with an equation of state [3] (such an advantage can also
be found in the artificial compressibility method, but only for steady-
state flows). Third, complex boundary conditions in the LB method
can be formulated with elementary mechanical rules such as bounce-
back and reflection according to the interactions of the LB
“molecules” with solid walls [23]. Moreover, the LB method is ideal
for parallel computing because of its explicit scheme, local inter-
actions, and consequently very low communication/computation
ratio. It is ideally situated to exploit the massively parallel super-
computers based on either CPUs or GPUs or heterogeneous
architectures. Meanwhile, it should be noted that, as a natural-
born dynamic scheme, the LB method is not a method of choice for
steady-state computations [16]. In addition, the standard LB method
is not well suited to body-fitted coordinates and adaptive time-
stepping [16].

Since the emergence of the LB method, its application in
multiphase flows has always been a very important theme of the
method. With the development in the past two decades, many
multiphase LB models have been proposed. These models mostly

fall into one of the following categories: the color-gradient LB method
[24–30], the pseudopotential LB method [31–39], the free-energy
LB method [40–44], and the phase-field LB method [45–53]. In ad-
dition, several multiphase LB models were recently developed based
on the entropic LB method [54] and the discrete Boltzmann equa-
tion [55]. The color-gradient LB method was introduced by Gunstensen
et al. [24], who employed red and blue particle distribution func-
tions to represent two different fluids. Besides the standard collision
operator, an additional collision operator was also utilized in this
method, which can be regarded as a source term for generating the
surface tension. Furthermore, to separate different phases and main-
tain interfaces, a recoloring process is required in the color-
gradient LB models [24–30,56].

The free-energy LB method was proposed by Swift et al. [40,41]
based on thermodynamics considerations. The second-order moment
of the equilibrium density distribution function was modified to
include a non-ideal thermodynamic pressure tensor. The phase sep-
aration was therefore described by a non-ideal equation of state in
the thermodynamic theory such as the van der Waals equation of
state. However, the original free-energy LB model suffered from the
lack of Galilean invariance owing to some non-Navier–Stokes terms
[57], which resulted from the incorporation of pressure tensor using
the equilibrium distribution function. To restore the Galilean in-
variance, some correction terms should be added to the equilibrium
distribution function [41–44]. A similar problem also exists in the
color-gradient LB method, in which the pressure is changed by modi-
fying the equilibrium distribution function. Therefore, the color-
gradient multiphase LB models also need some correction terms to
eliminate the non-Navier–Stokes terms in the recovered macro-
scopic equations [58–60].

The pseudopotential LB method, which is the simplest multiphase
LB method, was devised by Shan and Chen [31,32]. In this method,
the fluid interactions are mimicked by an interparticle potential,
through which the separation of fluid phases or components can
be achieved automatically, without resorting to any techniques to
track or capture interfaces [61]. In fact, the interparticle potential
will lead to a non-ideal pressure tensor, although it is different from
that in the free-energy LB method. The pseudopotential LB method
has become very popular in the multiphase LB community due to

its conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency [3,12,62–64]
and has been applied with great success to many problems.

The fourth category, the phase-field LB method, represents the
multiphase LB models that are based on the phase-field theory, in
which the interface dynamics is described by an order parameter
that obeys the Cahn–Hilliard equation or a Cahn–Hilliard-like equa-
tion [65]. In 1999, an incompressible multiphase LB model was
proposed by He et al. [45]. In this model, the liquid-gas interface
was captured with the evolution of an index function (order pa-
rameter). Meanwhile, the recovered interface-capturing equation
was found to be a Cahn–Hilliard-like equation. In this regard, He
et al.’s model is a phase-field LB model, even though the model was
not directly built on the phase-field theory. Similarly, the multiphase
LB model devised by Lee and Lin [47] also belongs to this category.
Much progress has been made in the above four categories of
multiphase LB methods since the aforementioned early studies.
However, these multiphase LB methods exhibit different perfor-
mances in simulating dynamic multiphase flows at large liquid-
g ∼ 103 in real world), which may be related
gas density ratios ( ρ ρl
to the following issues. First, it can be found that in these multiphase
LB methods, the physical quantities that need to be evaluated across
the liquid-gas interface are different. For instance, in the free-
energy and the pseudopotential LB methods, the density and the
pseudopotential are used, respectively. Second, as just mentioned,
the free-energy and the color-gradient LB methods need some cor-
rection terms to remove the non-Navier-Stokes terms in the
macroscopic equations. These correction terms will introduce ad-
ditional sources of numerical instability as they involve many
density-gradient terms such as v∇ρ and v·∇ρ, where v is the ve-
locity [41–44,58–60]. This is one of the reasons why the free-
energy and the color-gradient multiphase LB methods usually suffer
from severe numerical instability in simulating dynamic multiphase
flows at large density ratios and high Reynolds numbers, although
they are successful in static or quasi-static cases with large density
ratios.

In comparison with the free-energy and the color-gradient LB
methods, the pseudopotential LB method and the phase-field LB
method have been successfully applied to dynamic multiphase flows
g ∼ 103) and relatively high Reynolds
at large density ratios ( ρ ρl

numbers (e.g., droplet splashing and droplet collision)
[39,46,47,49,66–72]. Moreover, the pseudopotential and the phase-
field multiphase LB methods have been widely employed to simulate
multiphase flows in fuel cells (water-gas two-phase transport) and
batteries (the electrolyte transport dynamics) [73–93] as well as
phase-change heat transfer (boiling, evaporation, etc.) [94–116]. It
is noticed that these two multiphase LB methods play an increas-
ingly important role in modeling multiphase flow and phase-
change heat transfer that are involved in energy science and
technologies from the viewpoint of a mesoscopic numerical
approach.

With the increase of practical applications of the LB method, it
is very necessary to review the related theories and clarify some
theoretical issues that are crucial to applications. The purpose of
this article is therefore to present a comprehensive review of the
advances in the pseudopotential and the phase-field multiphase LB
methods. Various theoretical aspects will be addressed, such as the
fundamental theory and basic models, the elimination of
thermodynamic/hydrodynamic inconsistency, the surface tension
treatment, the adjustment of interface thickness, and the imple-
mentation of contact angles. Meanwhile, the thermal LB models
based on these two multiphase LB methods for simulating liquid-
vapor phase change will also be critically reviewed. Furthermore,
we will summarize several forcing schemes that are widely used
in the LB method, which also play a crucial role in the multiphase
LB methods. In addition, the thermal LB approaches on standard lat-
tices, which are extensively involved in the LB simulations of phase-
change heat transfer, will be discussed in detail.

It is worth mentioning that there have been some excellent books
on the LB method, covering different aspects of theories and ap-
plications, e.g., by Succi [2], Wolf-Gladrow [11], Sukop and Thorne
[12], Mohamad [14], and Guo and Shu [15]. There have also been
several comprehensive reviews in the field, e.g., by Benzi et al. [10],
Chen and Doolen [3], and Aidun and Clausen [13]. The rest of the
present paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the fun-
damentals of the LB method, the forcing schemes, and the thermal
LB approaches on standard lattices. The pseudopotential and the
phase-field multiphase LB methods are comprehensively re-
viewed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 reviews some
applications of the multiphase and thermal LB methods, including
the applications in fuel cells and batteries, droplet collision, boiling
heat transfer and evaporation, and energy storage with phase change
materials. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the key points of the present
review and gives a brief discussion about the further develop-
ments and future prospects of the multiphase and thermal LB
methods for thermofluids and energy applications.

2. The basic LB formulations

2.1. The LB-BGK formulation

Historically, the LB method [4–9] originated from the lattice gas
automata method [6,117], which can be considered as a simpli-
fied fictitious molecular dynamics model in which the space, time,
and particle velocities are all discrete. Later it was demonstrated
[118,119] that the LB equation can be rigorously derived from the
Boltzmann equation in the kinetic theory, which not only estab-
lishes a direct connection between the LB method and the kinetic
theory but also greatly solidifies the physics base of the LB method.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the LB method is not limited
to dilute gases (a limitation of the Boltzmann equation) because it
can be extended to incorporate non-ideal interactions through the
effective interactions in the spirit of density functional theory. In
this paper we start with the Boltzmann equation [2,11], which can
be written as (without external forces)

From Eqs. (6) and (7) we can see that the collision process is
completely local and the streaming process is completely
linear. Actually, many advantages of the LB method arise from
such a feature. For instance, it can be seen that most of the
computations take place locally at the collision process,
which makes the LB method highly amenable to parallel comput-
ing [2,23].

In the literature, the set of the lattice velocities {eα} is often
denoted as the DdQn lattice model [9], where d and n represent the
spatial dimension and the total number of the lattice velocities, re-
spectively. The widely used two-dimensional nine-velocity lattice
model is named “D2Q9” and its lattice velocities {eα} are given

2.2. The LB–MRT formulation

Owing to its extreme simplicity, the BGK collision operator is still
the most frequently used operator in the LB community. Neverthe-
less, the LB-BGK equation usually suffers from severe numerical
instability at high Reynolds numbers (the relaxation time τ is close
to 0.5). Hence several alternative collision operators, such as the
multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator [120–123] and
the two-relaxation-time collision operator [124–126], have been pro-
posed. The entropic LB method [127–132] and the cascaded LB
method [133–136] have also attracted significant attention.

The MRT collision operator is an important extension of the re-
laxation LB method proposed by Higuera et al. [5,6] and the standard
LB–MRT equation is given by [14,120–123]:

The Chapman–Enskog analysis can be applied to the LB–MRT

procedure, readers are referred to References 137,139–141. In the
literature [123,140,142–148], it has been demonstrated that the MRT
collision model is superior over the BGK collision model in terms
of numerical stability because the relaxation times in the MRT col-
lision operator can be individually tuned to achieve “optimal” stability
[122].

The forcing scheme, which is used to incorporate an
external force into the LB equation, plays an important role in the
LB method. It determines whether the force of the system
is correctly implemented and therefore affects the numerical ac-
curacy of the LB model. Here we focus on introducing several
forcing schemes that have been demonstrated to be accurate in
recovering the unsteady macroscopic equations at the Navier–
Stokes level in the low Mach number limit. In addition, a
forcing scheme proposed by Kupershtokh et al. [149] will
also be reviewed. For steady problems, readers are referred
to the studies of Mohamad and Kuzmin [150] and Silva and Semiao
[151].

Using the transformation matrix, fα and its equilibrium distri-
bution function f eq
α can be projected onto the moment space. For
the D2Q9 model, the following results can be obtained [121,137]:

2.3.1. He et al.’s scheme and Guo et al.’s scheme

In 1998, He et al. [152] proposed a forcing scheme based on the
complete Boltzmann–BGK equation with an external body force,
which is given by

(17)

where a is the acceleration due to the body force F = ρa [139] and
∇ξf
f= ∂ ∂xx . Considering that the equilibrium distribution func-
tion f eq is the leading part of the distribution function f and the
gradient of f eq has the most important contribution to the gradi-
ent of f, He et al. [152] assumed that ∇ ∇ξ
f eq
. With the aid of
ξ
Eq. (2), they obtained ∇ξf
RT
. Then the discrete
Boltzmann–BGK equation with an external force can be written as
follows:

Comparing Eqs. (25) and (26) with Eqs. (21) and (22), we can
find that He et al.’s scheme and Guo et al.’s scheme are basically
the same except that the form of the forcing term is different. Ac-
tually, Guo and Zheng [137] have shown that the difference between
these two forcing schemes lies in the second-order moment of the
forcing term:

The third-order velocity term in Eq. (28) is an error term result-
ing from the deviation between the third-order moment of f eq
α and
that of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution function f eq . However,
for low Mach number flows, the third-order velocity term can be
neglected and then the two forcing schemes will be equivalent.

The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (21) is just the

density and velocity should be calculated by [152]

To sum up, Eq. (21) together with Eq. (22) constitutes He et al.’s
forcing scheme. In fact, it can be seen that Eqs. (21) and (22) are
self-consistent; hence the hat “−” of f α in Eqs. (21) and (22) can be
dropped in practical applications. However, the transformation given
by Eq. (20) should be kept in mind in some cases, which will be men-
tioned below.

A similar forcing scheme was later devised by Guo et al. [153]
in 2002. The major difference is that Guo et al.’s forcing term is
written in a power series of eα:

(23)

Previously we have mentioned that the hat “−” of f α in Eqs. (21)
and (22) can be dropped in practical applications. Nevertheless, we
should keep Eq. (20) in mind in some cases, e.g., in the case of cal-
culating the strain rate tensor using the second-order moment of
the non-equilibrium distribution function, which is often required
in the LB simulations of non-Newtonian flows [154–157] and in the
LB-based simulations of turbulent flows [158,159]. According to the
Chapman–Enskog analysis of the standard LB-BGK equation, namely
⎤⎦
v T 2
Eq. (5), we can find that the strain rate tensor ff =
can be computed locally as follows [154,158]:

(29)

The above formulation is also valid for Eq. (19). Hence, when Eqs.
(21) and (22) are used, fα in Eq. (29) should be evaluated accord-
ing to Eq. (20), which yields

f ≈ −

(30)

Moreover, it can be found that fα in Eqs. (25) and (26) is actu-
ally equivalent to f α in Eqs. (21) and (22). Hence, for Guo et al.’s
forcing scheme, one can replace f α in Eq. (30) with fα and remove
the third-order velocity term [160].

where B and C are functions of the force F and determined by re-
quiring that the moments of the forcing term Fα are consistent with
the target macroscopic equations. Using the Chapman–Enskog anal-
ysis, Guo et al. [153] found that B and C should be chosen as follows
so as to recover the correct unsteady macroscopic equations at the
Navier–Stokes level:

2.3.2. Wagner’s scheme and the exact-difference-method scheme

where the forcing term Fα,Wa satisfies the following constraints (see
Eqs. (20), (21), and (59) in Reference 161 and neglect the high-
order term beyond the Navier–Stokes level):

The LB equation with Guo et al.’s forcing term is then given by

By conducting the Taylor expansion analysis of Eq. (31), Wagner
stressed that the forcing term must satisfy Eqs. (32) and (33) in order
to recover the correct unsteady macroscopic equations at the Navier–
Stokes level. It can be seen that, in Wagner’s forcing scheme, the

Substituting v u

into Eq. (27), we can find that Eq.

(36) is the same as the result of Guo et al.’s forcing scheme, which
means that Wagner’s forcing scheme is identical to Guo et al.’s forcing
scheme, although they were given in different forms.

A forcing scheme, which was named “exact-difference-method
(EDM) scheme” by Kupershtokh et al. [149,162], is now reviewed.
On the basis of He et al.’s work [152], Kupershtokh et al. [162] found
that ∇

Actually, Wagner’s forcing scheme and the EDM forcing scheme
belong to the same class of forcing schemes, in which the velocity

, respectively. For this class of forcing schemes, the
usual Chapman–Enskog analysis in the literature should be revised
so as to derive the actual macroscopic equations recovered from
these forcing schemes. For the EDM forcing scheme, the following
macroscopic momentum equation can be obtained at the Navier–
Stokes level:

where Π is the viscous stress tensor. The last term on the right-

In 2005, McCracken and Abraham [139] proposed a

equation:

respectively. Note that the third-order velocity terms have
been omitted in Eq. (51). When Gα in Eq. (46) is taken
following Guo et al.’s [153] approach, the same S will be
obtained.

The macroscopic density and velocity are also calculated via Eq.
(22). Through the Chapman–Enskog analysis, McCracken and
Abraham [139] demonstrated that the macroscopic equations at the
Navier–Stokes level with an external force can be correctly recov-
ered using the above MRT forcing scheme. Moreover, according to
the Chapman–Enskog analysis [137,139], we can find that, due to
the freedom of the MRT collision model, the MRT forcing term or
any other source terms in the LB–MRT equation can be directly con-
structed in the moment space [15,137] without resorting to their
BGK forms.

In the LB–MRT method, the strain rate tensor ff =

2.4. The thermal LB method on standard lattices

In this section, the thermal LB method for simulating thermal
flows on standard lattices is introduced. The standard lattices [166]
represent the lattice models that are commonly used in the LB
method, such as the D2Q9, D3Q15, and D3Q19 lattice models [9].
The earliest attempts to construct thermal LB models were made
by Massaioli et al. [167], Alexander et al. [168], and Qian [169] in
1993. Since then, many thermal LB models have been developed
and most of these models can be classified into the following cat-
egories [15,137,170]: the multispeed approach [145,168,169,171–188],
the double-distribution-function approach [189–211], and the hybrid
approach [51,104,111,212–216].

The multispeed approach is a straightforward extension of the
isothermal LB method. In this approach, high-order lattices are uti-
lized and the equilibrium distribution function usually includes the
higher-order velocity terms so as to recover the energy equation
at the macroscopic level [174]. Numerous studies have been con-
ducted within the framework of the multispeed LB approach and
deserve a comprehensive review, which is beyond the scope of the
present work. Readers can refer to References 2,15,179 and the ref-
erences therein. Here we briefly introduce the DDF approach and
the hybrid approach, which are often constructed on the standard
lattices and widely encountered in the simulations of thermal
multiphase flows with the pseudopotential and the phase-field LB
methods.

2.4.1. The double-distribution-function (DDF) approach

Unlike the multispeed LB approach, in which only the density
distribution function is involved, the DDF LB approach utilizes two
different distribution functions, one (the density distribution func-
tion) for the flow field and the other for the energy or temperature
field. In the literature, various DDF LB models have been devised
from different points of view [189–195,197–202]. For conve-
nience, these models are classified according to their target
macroscopic energy equation.

Firstly, we give the macroscopic energy equation of ideal gases
in terms of the internal energy and the total energy, respectively,
which can be found elsewhere:

where e = cvT is the internal energy, E
. v is the total energy,
λ is the thermal conductivity, p is the pressure, Π is the viscous stress
tensor, p∇·v denotes the compression work, and Π : ∇v is the viscous
heat dissipation.

e= + 0 5 2

The above two equations are equivalent for an ideal gas system
without external forces. In the presence of an external force F, a term
F·v should be added to the right-hand side of Eq. (57). When the
compression work and the viscous heat dissipation can be ne-
glected, the internal energy equation (56) will reduce to

According to the target macroscopic equations, most of the ex-
isting DDF LB models fall into the following three types: the internal-
energy-based model, the total-energy-based model, and the
temperature-based model.

2.4.1.1. The internal-energy- and total-energy-based DDF models. The
internal-energy-based DDF LB model, which is also the most well-
known DDF model in the LB community, was proposed by He et al.
[189], who introduced an internal energy distribution function gα
to simulate the internal energy field, while the density and veloc-
ity fields are still modeled with the density distribution function
fα. The two distribution functions fα and gα satisfy the following dis-
crete Boltzmann equations [189]:

where τg is the relaxation time for the internal energy, which cor-
responds to the thermal conductivity λ τ ρ=

α is the equilibrium internal energy distribution func-
(
v∇ . The LB equations of fα and gα
tion, and q
e
can be obtained by adopting a second-order integration for Eqs. (60)
and (61) [189]. He et al. [189] showed that their model has excel-
lent numerical stability and the viscous heat dissipation together
with the compression work done by the pressure can be taken into
account. The internal-energy-based DDF model has received much
attention since its emergence and has been applied in many
applications.

From Eq. (61) we can see that a complicated term qα, which
involves the temporal and spatial derivatives of macroscopic
variables, exists in the evolution equation of the internal energy dis-
tribution function. Guo et al. [190] pointed out that such a
complicated term may introduce some additional errors and affect
the numerical stability of the model. Based on He et al.’s work,
Shi et al. [192] found that fαqα in Eq. (61) can be simplified as
v: ∇ and demonstrated that such a change
f q
α α
does not influence the recovered macroscopic equations at the
Navier–Stokes level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the velocity gra-
dient term ∇v is still required.

To solve this problem, Guo et al. [190] proposed a total-energy-
based DDF LB model by introducing a total energy distribution
function hα to replace the internal energy distribution function gα.
In Guo et al.’s model, the density distribution function fα still obeys
Eq. (60) but Gα is different. The evolution equation of the total energy
distribution function was also derived from the Boltzmann equa-
tion and is given by [190]

several simplified internal-energy-based DDF models have been pro-
posed by Peng et al. [191], Shi et al. [192], and Li et al. [194],
respectively. The simplified thermal LB equation for gα is given by

where the equilibrium internal energy distribution function can be

ered from Eq. (63) [195]:

where γ λ=

Chapman–Enskog analyses of Eq. (63) and the LB equation with a
forcing term. To be specific, it is attributed to the evaluation of ∂t 0v
in the Chapman–Enskog analysis of Eq. (63), which can be seen from
Eq. (68). To eliminate the error term in Eq. (64), a correction term
should be added to Eq. (63) [195]:

The correction term does not affect the calculation of the mac-
roscopic internal energy as its summation over α is zero. In 2009,
Li et al. [196] mentioned that a correction term is needed for Eq.
(63) in the presence of a body force, but also pointed out that the
correction term can be neglected. Recently, Li and Luo [195] showed
that the error term arising from the external force will lead to sig-
nificant numerical errors in certain cases, e.g., in the pseudopotential
LB modeling of thermal flows.

2.4.1.2. The temperature-based DDF models. Now attention turns to
the temperature-based DDF LB models, which are usually devised
for solving Eq. (59). For incompressible flows with negligible density
variations, the right-hand side of Eq. (59) can be rewritten as
⋅ (
∇ ∇
, where χ is the thermal diffusivity. The
most well-known temperature-based DDF LB model may be attrib-
uted to Shan [197], who treated the temperature as a passive
scalar and introduced a temperature distribution function, which

related to the external force F. Similarly, the LB equations of fα and
hα can be attained by integrating Eqs. (60) and (62) with a second-
order integration [190]. From Eq. (62) it can be found that there are
no complicated terms that consist of the gradients of macroscopic
quantities. Hence in the total-energy-based DDF model, the inclu-
sion of the compression work and the viscous heat dissipation is
simpler and easier than that in the internal-energy-based DDF model.
Recently, a similar total-energy-based DDF model has been devel-
oped by Karlin et al. [193]. In addition, based on Guo et al.’s work,
Li et al. [144] have constructed a coupling DDF model on the stan-
dard D2Q9 lattice, which can recover the equation of state of ideal
gases, p = ρRT.

In some applications, the compression work and the viscous heat
dissipation are negligible; thus Eq. (58) can be taken as the target
macroscopic energy equation. On the basis of this consideration,

recent years, several temperature-based DDF LB–MRT models have
also been developed [146,217,218], in which the LB-BGK equa-
tions of the density and temperature distribution functions were
replaced by an isothermal LB–MRT equation and a thermal LB–
MRT equation, respectively. Numerical results showed that these
temperature-based DDF LB–MRT models have better numerical sta-
bility than their BGK counterparts [146,217,218].

one error term is proportional to ∇

of these error terms because in certain cases they may result in con-
siderable numerical errors, e.g., if the hydrodynamic model is a
multiphase LB model, then ∇ρ ρ cannot be neglected. For the
temperature-based thermal LB equation on the D2Q4 or D2Q5 lattice,
similar error terms can be found, whether using the BGK or MRT
collision operator.

A couple of improved DDF LB models [199,200] have been re-
cently developed to eliminate the error terms in Eq. (67). Based on
the isothermal LB model proposed by He and Luo [219], Chai and
Zhao [199] have devised an improved DDF LB model by introduc-
ing an additional term into the equilibrium temperature distribution
function as well as a source term into the thermal LB equation. Huang
and Wu [200] have developed an improved thermal LB–MRT equa-
tion by modifying the collision process of the distribution functions
in the moment space, which prevents the generation of ∂ (
t T0 v in
Eq. (67). Therefore, the error terms resulting from ∂ (
)
t T0 v were
removed. Meanwhile, the term ∇ ⋅ (
T vv in Eq. (67) was elimi-
nated by dropping the second-order velocity terms in the equilibria.
Besides the above three types of DDF LB models, several DDF LB
models have been developed based on the enthalpy and the total
enthalpy [201,202], which are similar to the models based on the
internal energy and the total energy, respectively.

2.4.2. The thermal boundary treatments

In this subsection, the thermal boundary treatments for the
DDF LB approach are briefly summarized. In LB simulations,
after the streaming step, the distribution functions pointing
into the fluid domain are unknown at the boundary nodes [2].
Evaluating these unknown distribution functions plays a crucial
role in the LB method. For isothermal LB models, many boundary
treatments have been devised [142,220–225]. However, com-
pared with the hydrodynamic boundary conditions, the thermal
boundary conditions have not been satisfactorily addressed because
the number of the unknown distribution functions at the bound-
ary nodes is usually larger than the number of the constraints
[184].

For the internal-energy-based DDF LB model, an early thermal
boundary treatment was developed by He et al. [189]. In their work,
the non-equilibrium bounce-back rule proposed by Zou and He [221]
was extended to impose thermal boundary conditions. Later, D’Orazio
et al. [226] and D’Orazio and Succi [227] devised a counter-slip
thermal boundary treatment for the internal-energy-based DDF LB
model through calculating the unknown internal energy distribu-
tion functions from the equilibrium internal energy distribution
functions with a counter-slip internal energy. In 2002, Guo et al. [198]
proposed a non-equilibrium extrapolation treatment for their
temperature-based DDF LB model. The temperature distribution
functions at the boundary nodes were decomposed into equilibri-
um and non-equilibrium parts. Meanwhile, the non-equilibrium part
was evaluated with an extrapolation of the non-equilibrium part
of the distribution functions at the neighboring nodes. Inspired by

Guo et al.’s non-equilibrium extrapolation scheme, Tang et al. [204]
have developed a thermal boundary treatment for the internal-
energy-based DDF LB model. In addition, Guo et al. [190] have
extended the non-equilibrium extrapolation scheme to their total-
energy-based DDF LB model.

Furthermore, Ginzburg [228] has proposed a multi-reflection
scheme to mimic the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condi-
tions in the LB models for advection and anisotropic dispersion
equations with arbitrarily shaped surfaces. In 2007, Kao and Yang
[229] used the bounce-back scheme to implement the adiabatic
boundary condition and employed the equilibrium distribution
functions to treat boundaries with a constant temperature. Later,
Kuo and Chen [230] developed a non-equilibrium mirror-
reflection boundary treatment for the Dirichlet boundary condition
and the adiabatic boundary condition, in which the relationship
between the heat flux and the first-order moment of the non-
equilibrium temperature distribution function was considered. In
2010, Liu et al. [231] suggested that the unknown energy distribu-
tion functions at the boundary nodes can be chosen to be functions
of the local known energy distribution functions together with
some corrections.

Recently, Zhang et al. [232] have proposed a general bounce-
back scheme to implement thermal and concentration boundary
conditions. In addition, Li et al. [233] have also developed a thermal
boundary treatment based on the bounce-back scheme and the
interpolation of the distribution functions. Inspired by the idea of
Yin and Zhang’s [234] method, Chen et al. [235] have developed
an improved bounce-back boundary treatment for thermal bound-
ary conditions, in which the midpoint temperature value was utilized
to modify the bounced-back population. It was shown that the
improved treatment has a simple algorithm and can easily deal
with the boundaries of complex geometries [235]. Besides the
above thermal boundary treatments, several immersed-boundary-
method-based thermal boundary schemes have also been proposed
[236,237]. Moreover, Huang et al. [238], Chen et al. [239], and Li
et al. [233] have developed thermal boundary treatments for curved
boundaries.

2.4.3. The hybrid approach

The concept of hybrid thermal LB approach was formally intro-
duced by Lallemand and Luo in 2003 [214]. Before that time,
Filippova and Hänel [212,213] had practically implemented such
an approach in modeling low Mach number combustion. Similar
to the flow simulation in the DDF LB approach, in the hybrid ap-
proach the LB flow simulation is also separated from the solution
of the temperature field, which is usually solved with convention-
al numerical methods, such as the finite-difference or finite-
volume method [51,104,111,212–216,240].

Various finite-difference schemes can be found in the text-
books of computational fluid dynamics. Here we just take the
second-order Runge–Kutta scheme as an example to illustrate the
implementation of a finite-difference scheme in the hybrid LB ap-
proach. With a constant thermal conductivity, Eq. (59) can be written
as

v are still at the t time level since they are given by the hydrody-
namic LB model.For the spatial discretization, a second-order
difference scheme can be used. In the framework of the LB method,
a widely used scheme is the second-order isotropic difference scheme
[47,241], which is constructed based on the following Taylor series
expansion:

are the same as those in Eq. (9). Similarly, the second-order isotro-

Note that both Eq. (70) and the second-order isotropic differ-
ence schemes are only applied in the interior field, namely the whole
computational field except the boundaries. For the Dirichlet thermal
boundary condition, the temperature at the boundary is known,
T = Tw. For the Neumann thermal boundary condition, the temper-
ature at the boundary can be extrapolated from the interior flow
field, where the temperature at the t + δt time level has been ob-
tained according to Eq. (70).

3. The pseudopotential multiphase LB method

3.1. The basic theory

3.1.1. The interaction force

The pseudopotential multiphase LB method was proposed by
Shan and Chen around 1993 [31,32]. They introduced an interpar-
) to mimic the interactions among the particles
ticle potential ψ x(
on the nearest-neighboring sites. Theoretically, ψ x(
) is not a po-
tential as it depends on space only through the intermediate of the
fluid density. This is why it is now widely called “pseudopotential”.
For single-component systems, the interaction force acting on the
particles at site x is given by [32,242]

where G is a parameter that controls the strength of the interac-
tion force and wα are the weights. For the nearest-neighbor
interactions on the D2Q9 lattice, the weights w α = 1 3 for eα
2 1=
and w α = 1 12 for eα
[242]. In some studies, the weights wα
are set to ωα in f eq
2 is used in Eq. (75) instead of G. The con-
version of G between these choices should be noticed.

2 2=
α or Gc s

The most distinctive feature of the pseudopotential LB method
is that the phase segregation between different phases can emerge
automatically as a result of the particle interactions, namely the in-
teraction force Eq. (75). As highlighted by Succi [16], the magic of
the simple interaction force lies in that it not only gives a non-

monotonic equation of state supporting the phase transition but also
yields non-zero surface tension. Therefore the interface between dif-
ferent phases can arise, deform and migrate naturally without using
any techniques to track or capture the interface. Owing to its con-
ceptual simplicity, computational efficiency and kinetic features, the
pseudopotential LB method has attracted significant attention and
has been applied in a variety of fields. In this section we will review
some recent advances in the pseudopotential LB method as well as
thermal pseudopotential LB models for simulating phase-change heat
transfer.

3.1.2. The Shan–Chen forcing scheme

In the original pseudopotential LB model devised by Shan and
Chen [31,32], the interaction force was incorporated into the LB equa-
tion by shifting the velocity in the equilibrium density distribution
function and the evolution equation is given by

The shifted equilibrium velocity ueq is defined as u

v u
by averaging the moment before and after the col-
lision process [243]. The forcing scheme given by Eq. (76) is referred
to as the Shan–Chen forcing scheme.

Shan–Chen forcing term can be written in the general form of forcing
schemes, i.e., Eq. (23), and the velocity in the forcing term is given
by v SC . With this result, the differences between the Shan–Chen
forcing scheme and Guo et al.’s forcing scheme, which has been dem-
onstrated to be capable of correctly recovering the unsteady
macroscopic equations at the Navier–Stokes level, can be clearly
observed.

Another forcing scheme that has received much attention in the
pseudopotential LB method is the EDM forcing scheme proposed

Section 2.3.2. It has been shown that several assumptions were used
in the derivation of the EDM forcing scheme. A theoretical com-
parison between the Shan–Chen scheme, the EDM scheme, and Guo
et al.’s scheme has been made by Li et al. [163], and can be found
ρ. From the table we can see that the
in Table 1, where u
Shan–Chen scheme is identical to the EDM scheme when the non-
dimensional relaxation time τ = 1, which was numerically reproduced
by Sun et al. [246] (see fig. 3 in the reference). Moreover, both the
Shan–Chen and the EDM forcing schemes suffer from the discrete
lattice effects and therefore cannot recover the correct macroscop-
ic equations. In addition, it can be found that the Shan–Chen and
the EDM forcing schemes share the following feature: the velocity
in f eq
is u, while the actual fluid velocity is defined as
α
= +
v u
F
. In Section 2.3.2, we have mentioned that the
usual Chapman–Enskog analysis should be revised for this
class of forcing schemes so as to derive the actual macroscopic
equations.

Huang et al. [245] and Sun et al. [246] have numerically inves-
tigated the performances of the Shan–Chen and the EDM forcing
schemes in the pseudopotential LB modeling of multiphase flows.
It was found [245] that the coexistence liquid-gas densities given
by the Shan–Chen forcing scheme significantly vary with the non-
dimensional relaxation time τ. Using the EDM forcing scheme, the
effects of the relaxation time τ were greatly reduced. Neverthe-
less, Huang et al. [245] found that the density ratios obtained by
the EDM forcing scheme still change with τ to some extent in the
cases of large density ratios. Meanwhile, Huang et al. showed that
the coexistence curves given by He et al.’s forcing scheme are es-
sentially independent of τ.

3.1.3. The mechanical stability condition

In this subsection, the mechanical stability condition in the
pseudopotential LB method is introduced, which can be estab-
lished according to the pressure tensor given by a pseudopotential
LB model. When the interaction force is recovered in the momen-
tum equation without any additional terms at the Navier–Stokes
level, the pressure tensor P can be defined as [247]

In 2008, Shan [242] clarified that in the pseudopotential LB
method the discrete form of the pressure tensor must be used, which
can be derived from the volume integral of Eq. (81). This point has
also been demonstrated by Sbragaglia and Belardinelli [248] for
multi-component systems. The corresponding discrete form of Eq.
(81) is given by

e.g., for the case of ψ0 = 4 and ρ0 = 200 [12], G = −40 leads to ρl ≈ 514
and ρg ≈ 79.5 [12,249]. Similarly, it can be found that when ψ0 = 1
and ρ0 = 1, G = −10 3 gives ρl ≈ 2.78 and ρg ≈ 0.367 [242,250].

Actually, the interaction force given by Eq. (75) is nothing but a
finite-difference scheme, which can be seen by comparing Eq. (75)
with Eq. (73). Fortunately, this formulation can lead to a non-ideal
pressure tensor, Eq. (84). For a standard free energy functional in
thermodynamics, the following non-ideal pressure tensor can be
obtained [40]:

The Maxwell equal-area construction can be derived from the
above pressure tensor [251]. It is obvious that Eq. (84) deviates from
Eq. (92) in general. However, it has been shown that, with an ap-
propriate choice of ψ ρ(
), the Maxwell construction can be
reproduced from Eq. (84). From this point, the pseudopotential LB
method can be regarded as a “pseudo” free-energy approach [252],
but note that in the pseudopotential LB method the non-ideal pres-
sure tensor is established through the interaction force rather than
changing f eq

α , which suffers from the loss of Galilean invariance.

Numerically, to guarantee thermodynamic consistency, an ac-
curate forcing scheme should be employed even though the
pseudopotential is chosen to be proportional to exp −(
)1 ρ . In the
literature, Yu and Fan [250] have shown that the numerical coex-
istence densities of liquid and gas phases obtained using the
−(
pseudopotential ψ ρ ψ
together with Guo et al.’s
forcing scheme are basically independent of the non-dimensional
relaxation time τ and consistent with the results given by the
Maxwell construction (see table 1 in Reference 250).

The problem that the Shan–Chen forcing scheme results in
τ−dependent coexistence curves was found to be attributed to the ad-
ditional terms introduced by the scheme into the macroscopic equations,
which make the mechanical stability condition dependent on τ and
ψ ρ2
[163]. For the EDM forcing scheme, the mechanical stability

condition still depends on ψ ρ2
in Eq. (45), although the relaxation time τ is seemingly not in-
volved. Obviously, when an additional term is introduced into Eq.
(81), the pressure tensor will be modified, and then the mechan-
ical stability condition will be changed correspondingly.

Here pEOS represents a non-ideal equation of state in the ther-

Starling, and the Peng–Robinson equations of state. Similar
statements can be found in References 34,253. In 2006, Yuan and
Schaefer [33] numerically found that the achievable largest density
ratio of the pseudopotential LB method can be significantly en-
hanced by choosing an appropriate equation of state in Eq. (93). For
static cases, a liquid-gas density ratio in excess of 1000 was suc-
cessfully modeled, however, with very large spurious currents at
τ = 1 [254]. Usually, when the relaxation time τ decreases, the spu-
rious currents will be further enlarged. Moreover, Eq. (93) will lead
to thermodynamic inconsistency: the liquid-gas coexistence densi-
ties given by the mechanical stability condition Eq. (90) are
inconsistent with the results of the Maxwell equal-area construction.
In 2012, Li et al. [163] pointed out that, when using Eq. (93), the
thermodynamic consistency can be approximately restored by ad-

where ε is a produced parameter that controls the mechanical sta-
bility condition. For the standard pseudopotential LB model with
the nearest-neighbor interactions, we can obtain the numerical
results of the case ε = 0 (namely Eq. (90)) by employing an accu-
rate forcing scheme in the standard LB approach, such as Guo et al.’s
scheme or the MRT forcing scheme in Section 2.3.3. It can be found
that the results of ε = 0 significantly deviate from those given by the
Maxwell construction when Eq. (93) is applied. The Shan–Chen and
the EDM forcing schemes usually yield a positive ε (ε > 0); however,
the specific value of ε depends on τ and/or ψ ρ2
. Analytically, the
liquid-gas coexistence densities can be obtained by solving Eq. (94).
For example, when ε = 2, Eq. (94) gives

By taking the Carnahan–Starling equation of state as an example,
Li et al. [163] have compared the analytical solutions of the me-
chanical stability condition at ε = 1 and 2 with the solution given
by the thermodynamic consistency requirement (i.e., the Maxwell
construction). The results can be found in Fig. 2. It can be seen that
there are nearly no differences in the liquid-phase density between
the analytical solutions of ε = 1 and ε = 2, which are both in good
agreement with the results given by the Maxwell construction.
Meanwhile, it can be observed that the gas-phase density given by
the Maxwell construction is larger than the gas-phase density of

ε = 1 but is smaller than that of ε = 2, which indicates that there exists
a value of ε (1 < ε < 2) that can make the mechanical stability so-
lution approximately identical to the solution given by the Maxwell
construction [163]. In other words, thermodynamic consistency can
be approximately restored by producing a suitable value of ε in the
mechanical stability condition. According to Fig. 2, the value of ε that
can provide thermodynamically consistent results falls into the in-
terval ε∈[

and is close to 2.

where Poriginal denotes the original pressure tensor given by Eq. (83).
With the modification of the pressure tensor, the mechanical sta-
bility condition is changed and the produced parameter ε is given
by ε = −16Gσ [163]. Note that, when the pseudopotential ψ is cal-
culated via Eq. (93), the only requirement for G is to ensure that
the whole term inside the square root in Eq. (93) is positive [33,34]
and the value of G does not affect the numerical results. In many
cases, G can be set to G = −1. For the EDM forcing scheme, an ad-
)∇ ∇ will be
ditional term that is proportional to ψ ρ ψ ψ
introduced into the pressure tensor owing to the term ∇ ⋅ (

FF ρ in
Eq. (45). As a result, the parameter ε yielded by the EDM forcing
scheme will be dependent on ψ ρ2

where the parameter A is utilized to tune the mixed interaction force.
Such a treatment has been applied in several studies [96,149,255],
but no physical explanation was given about the reason why it is
able to adjust liquid-gas coexistence densities. Actually, using the
Taylor series expansion and evaluating the discrete form pressure
tensor, one can find that Eq. (100) will introduce a term propor-
tional to ∇ψ∇ψ into the pressure tensor. In this regard, the treatments
given by Eqs. (97) and (100) share the same feature, i.e., thermo-
dynamic inconsistency is approximately eliminated by modifying
the mechanical stability condition. Similarly, they also share the same
weakness, namely the surface tension will be affected because a term
proportional to ∇ψ∇ψ has been added to the anisotropic part of the
pressure tensor. Recently, Hu et al. have conducted theoretical and
numerical analyses of the mixed interaction force given by Eq. (100)
and the details can be found in Reference 256.

To overcome the above weakness, Li et al. [39] in 2013 pro-
posed an improved forcing scheme based on the LB–MRT equation,
which utilizes the following forcing term:

condition is tuned by changing the isotropic part of the pressure
tensor rather than the anisotropic part, therefore avoiding affect-
ing the surface tension term. Moreover, it can be found that F in
the additional terms of v new and Eq. (101) actually serves as an ap-
proximation for ψ∇ψ. At large density ratios, the higher-order terms
in F will also exert an influence on the liquid-gas coexistence den-
sities. For the BGK scheme, the additional term in v new is proportional
to F τ−(
. As a result, the coexistence densities at large density
ratios will vary with viscosity to some extent when τ changes with
viscosity. Using the MRT scheme, the influence of viscosity at large
density ratios can be significantly reduced because only τv changes
with viscosity and the other relaxation times including τe and τς in
Eq. (101) remain unchanged.

For the Carnahan–Starling equation of state, Li et al. [39] nu-
merically found that thermodynamic consistency can be
approximately achieved when ε∼ 1 7.
, which agrees with the the-
oretical analysis that 1 < ε < 2 and ε is close to 2. The numerical
coexistence curves obtained by the improved MRT forcing scheme
for the Carnahan–Starling equation of state can be found in Fig. 3,
which shows that the numerical coexistence curves are in good
agreement with the results given by the Maxwell construction and
are essentially independent of the viscosity (the relaxation time τv).
Using the improved MRT forcing scheme, Li et al. [39] have simu-
lated droplet splashing on a thin liquid film at the density ratio
ρ ρl
g ∼ 750 ( T Tc = 0 5. ) and Re = 1000. Several treatments have
been introduced to reduce the spurious currents and increase the
achievable highest Reynolds number. Some numerical results can
be found in Fig. 4. The approach has been applied to simulate droplet

impact on a solid surface at a large density ratio by Zhang et al. [70],
who have extended the improved MRT forcing scheme to three di-
mensions using the D3Q19 lattice [71]. The three-dimensional
scheme has been applied to study coalescence-induced droplet
jumping on superhydrophobic textured surfaces and liquid con-
densate adhesion on slit and plain fins [257]. Moreover, Xu et al.
[258] have proposed an alternative three-dimensional version using
the D3Q15 lattice.

Finally, it should be stressed that adjusting the mechanical sta-
bility condition is an approximate approach to achieving
thermodynamic consistency for Eq. (93) because a fitting proce-
dure is required. Recently, Khajepor et al. [259] proposed a multi-
pseudopotential interaction force to eliminate thermodynamic
inconsistency, which consists of several exponential pseudopotential
)λ ρ , where the subscript i
,(cid:2) (n is the
interactions, G i
total number of the pseudopotential interactions). A fitting proce-
dure is utilized to adjust Gi and λi so as to match the results given
by the prescribed equation of state such as the Carnahan–Starling
equation of state (see appendix B in Reference 259). Because the
exponential pseudopotential interaction does not contain the tem-
perature, the parameters Gi and λi should change with the reduced
temperature T Tc .

3.3. Spurious currents and the interface thickness

Despite its undeniable success, the pseudopotential LB method
has also drawn much criticism because of the large spurious cur-
rents produced near curved interfaces [36]. The spurious currents,
which are also called spurious velocities, have been observed in

almost all the simulations of multiphase flows involving curved in-
terfaces. When the spurious currents are as large as the characteristic
velocities of the problem under study, it is difficult to distinguish
the physical velocity from the spurious velocity and then the flow
physics may be misinterpreted [260]. Therefore, it is very impor-
tant to suppress or reduce the spurious currents when simulating
multiphase flows. In 2006, Shan [261] pointed out that the spuri-
ous currents produced by the pseudopotential LB models mainly
arise from insufficient isotropy of the discrete gradient operator and
can be reduced by using high-order isotropic gradient operators in
calculating the interaction force.

Later, Sbragaglia et al. [36] extended the idea of Shan to include
more neighbors. They showed that the spurious currents can be
further reduced when higher-order isotropic operators are em-
ployed to calculate the interaction force. However, it was also pointed
out that, when additional neighbors are included, the implemen-
tation of boundary conditions (particularly for wall boundaries) will
become complex [36,260]. Moreover, Sbragaglia and Shan [262]
found that, when using the high-order isotropic operators,

so as to satisfy the thermodynamic consistency, where ε is deter-
mined by the mechanical stability condition of the higher-order
interactions.

In 2009, Yu and Fan [38] developed an MRT version of the
pseudopotential LB model and found that the MRT collision model
can reduce the spurious currents as compared with the BGK colli-
sion model, which can be seen in Fig. 5. For the studied case, it was
shown that the maximum magnitudes of the spurious currents
given by the BGK and MRT models are 0.028 and 0.0053, respec-
tively [38].

(

) =

Besides the above approaches, a refinement of curved inter-
faces is also capable of reducing the spurious currents, which is based
on the fact that a better resolved interface provides a better reso-
lution for the density gradient and thus can give a reduction of
spurious currents. Sbragaglia et al. [36] found that, for the
[
pseudopotential ψ ρ
, the interface thick-
1 exp
ness can be adjusted by tuning ρ0. They stressed that increasing the
interface thickness is more effective than the use of high-order iso-
tropic gradient operators in terms of reducing the spurious currents,
as the former treatment is found to give a numerical reduction of
the maximal spurious current up to a factor of 10 by only dou-
bling the interface thickness, while a 10th-order (or even higher)
isotropic gradient operator is required to reach similar level of ac-
curacy [36].

It was found that lowering p0 can increase the interface thickness
and the achievable largest density ratio can be enhanced by wid-
ening the interface thickness, which can be seen in Fig. 6. A similar
treatment has also been proposed by Hu et al. [264] for the
pseudopotential LB method.

Moreover, Huang et al. [245] found that the parameters a and
b in the equations of state [33] affect the interface thickness. Sim-
ilarly, Li et al. [39] found that the interface thickness is approximately
proportional to 1 a when the other parameters are fixed. Mean-
while, it was shown that the interface thickness decreases when
the reduced temperature T Tc decreases (see fig. 3 in Reference 39).
With the usual choice of the parameters a and b, such as a = 1 and

b = 4 for the Carnahan–Starling equation of state [33], the inter-
face will become very sharp in the cases of small T Tc (corresponding
to large density ratios). Using a sharp interface, the spurious cur-
rents will be magnified dramatically. This is one of the reasons why
the spurious currents shown in Yuan and Schaefer’s work [33] are
very large at high density ratios. Montessori et al. [265] recently also
found that the spurious currents can be significantly reduced when
decreasing the parameter a (see fig. 5 in the reference). Here it should
also be mentioned that, at a given density ratio, the interface thick-
ness produced by different equations of state is often different, unless
an adjustment of the interface thickness has been made.

Using p

or tuning the parameter a in the equation of
state will not change the liquid-gas coexistence densities given by
the Maxwell construction [39,264]. However, the coexistence den-
sities produced by the pseudopotential LB models will be affected,
because the mechanical stability condition will be changed due to
the term ′ψ ψ in Eq. (90). Accordingly, the constant σ in Eq. (101),
which is used to tune the mechanical stability condition, should be
slightly changed with the parameter a [39].

Furthermore, it should be noted that the sound speed (related
∂p ρ) in both the liquid and gas phases will decrease when p0
to ∂
is lowered [263]. A similar trend can be found when decreasing the

3.4. The surface tension treatment

Another drawback of the original pseudopotential LB model is
that the surface tension given by the model cannot be tuned inde-
pendently of the density ratio [36]. This problem can be found from
the definition of the surface tension. For a flat interface, the surface
tension θ can be evaluated as

In other words, for the classical equations of state in the ther-

Starling equations of state, the variations of the liquid-gas coexistence

liquid-gas interface) will be magnified when the interface is widened

p ρ . To reduce such an influence, for isothermal
systems an alternative choice may be adopting a piecewise equa-
tion of state proposed by Colosqui et al. [268], through which

tude as the lattice sound speed cs so that the dependence of
the coexistence densities on the droplet size can be significantly
reduced.

where
justed by G in Eq. (108). However, in the original pseudopotential
LB model, G controls the interaction strength. Different values of G
correspond to different liquid-gas coexistence densities. For the
square-root pseudopotential given by Eq. (93), G in front of the in-
tegral in Eq. (108) and 1/G in ψ′2 will cancel each other out. As a
result, G has no influence on the surface tension. This conclusion
is also applicable to circular and spherical interfaces, although Eq.
(108) is the analytical expression for flat interfaces. For circular and
spherical interfaces, the surface tension can be numerically evalu-
ated via Laplace’s law. Here it should also be noted that the definition
of the surface tension in the pseudopotential LB method is differ-
ent from that in thermodynamic theory, in which the surface tension
is defined as θ

to the standard interaction force given by Eq. (75). Later, based on
Sbragaglia et al.’s work, Falcucci et al. [37] and Chibbaro et al. [269]
proposed a two-belt multi-range interaction force. In addition,
Falcucci et al. [270] have shown that the cooperation between the
short- and mid-range interactions permits the achievement of phase-
separation at liquid-gas density ratios in excess of 500. Using the
Taylor expansion, Sbragaglia et al. have obtained the following con-
tinuum form pressure tensor of the multi-range interaction force

In 2011, Huang et al. [245] found that the density ratio of the
system changes when the multi-range interaction force is em-
ployed to adjust the surface tension. The results can be found in
Table 2, which shows that the multi-range interaction force can
provide a tunable surface tension at a given T Tc ; nevertheless, the
density ratio changes considerately with the surface tension. In fact,

the multi-range interaction force is capable of separating the equa-
tion of state from the surface tension. However,
in the
pseudopotential LB method, the liquid-gas coexistence densities are
not only related to the equation of state but also dependent on the
mechanical stability condition.

In 2013, following the statement of Shan [242], i.e., in the
pseudopotential LB method the discrete form pressure tensor should
be used, Li and Luo [249] derived the discrete form pressure tensor
of the multi-range interaction force and found that the mechani-
cal stability condition given by the multi-range interaction force
depends on the parameters G1 and G2, which may be the reason why
the density ratio of the system changes when the multi-range in-
teraction force is used to adjust the surface tension.

An alternative approach was therefore proposed by Li and Luo
[249] based on the LB–MRT equation. The basic idea is adding a
source term into the LB–MRT equation and then Eq. (49) becomes

where the constant κ is used to tune the surface tension. It can be
seen that Q is based on the standard discrete form pressure tensor
defined by Eq. (83) and is consistent with the calculation of the
pseudopotential interaction force, Eq. (75). Through Chapman–
Enskog analysis, it can be found that Eqs. (111) and (112) lead to
the following second-order discrete form pressure tensor

ψ∇2ψI has also been changed, which ensures that the normal pres-

dition, which determines the coexistence densities, will not be

Numerical results showed that the surface tension can be ad-

for the surface tension and not shown in Eq. (114), may notice-
ably contribute to the surface tension when the coefficient in front
of the term ψ∇∇ψ is very small. Recently, following the above ap-
proach, Xu et al. [258] have devised a three-dimensional
pseudopotential LB–MRT model with flexible surface tension. In ad-
dition, the approach has been employed by Hu et al. [271] to adjust
the surface tension given by the mixed interaction force, Eq. (100).
It is worth noting that the theoretical frameworks of all the ex-
isting multiphase LB methods are based on second-order Chapman–
Enskog analysis. Wagner [161] argued that second-order Chapman-
Enskog analysis may be insufficient for a multiphase LB model
because the higher-order derivatives are seemingly not derivable
with a second-order expansion. By taking the free-energy multiphase
LB method as an example, Wagner [161] has conducted a high-
order Taylor expansion analysis to identify the high-order terms
recovered in the macroscopic equations (see Eq. (49) in the refer-
ence). Nevertheless, Wagner also stressed that there is still much
debate about whether a Taylor expansion analysis is equivalent to
a Chapman–Enskog analysis in high orders. Moreover, Wagner [161]
has proposed a forcing scheme based on the Taylor expansion anal-
ysis, which has been introduced in Section 2.3.2 and shown to be
identical to Guo et al.’s forcing scheme.

Recently, based on Wagner’s work, Lycett-Brown and Luo [272]
have performed a high-order Taylor expansion analysis for the stan-
dard pseudopotential LB model. An assumption F = c s
2∇ρ was
employed (see eq. (A8) in Reference 272). The surface tension was
tuned in a way that is similar to Eq. (113). In addition, a forcing
scheme similar to Eq. (97) was utilized to adjust the mechanical sta-
bility condition. Without the adjustment of the surface tension, the
forcing term in Reference 272 satisfies the following relationship
(see eqs. (34) and (37) in the reference):

The first three terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (115) are the
results of Wagner’s forcing term (δt = 1), which can be seen from
Eq. (33). The last terms in Eqs. (98) and (115) are similar since σ
in Eq. (98) is given by σ ε= − 16G and ε0 in Eq. (115), which was
numerically determined by Eq. (35) in Reference 272, corresponds
to ε = ε0. The appearance of c s
2 in Eq. (115) is due to its existence
in the interaction force in Reference 272.

3.5. The contact angle treatment

Wetting phenomena are widespread in natural and industrial pro-
cesses. The wettability of a solid surface by a liquid is often quantified
via the contact angle [273–275]. There have been many studies of
wetting phenomena using the pseudopotential LB model since its
emergence. The first attempt was made by Martys and Chen in 1996
[276]. In their study, a fluid-solid interaction force was introduced
to describe the interaction between the fluid and the solid
wall

the pre-sum factor is the pseudopotential ψ x(
). For simplicity, these
two types of fluid–solid interaction are referred to as the ρ−based
interaction and the ψ−based interaction, respectively. In the liter-
ature, Kang et al. [279,280] have extended Martys and Chen’s ρ−based
fluid-solid interaction to the D2Q9 lattice model.

In 2006, Benzi et al. [281,282] introduced a parameter ψ ρw(
) to
fix the pseudopotential at the solid wall via a virtual wall density
ρw. By introducing a suitable value for ρw, the contact angle can be
adjusted between 0o and 180°. Some numerical results obtained with
such a treatment can be found in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the contact
angle approaches 0o and 180° when the virtual wall density ρw is
close to the liquid-phase density ρl and the gas-phase density ρg,
respectively.

In 2013, Colosqui et al. [284] proposed a new fluid–solid inter-
action, which is composed of a repulsive core and an attractive
tail

nevertheless, they pointed out that their approach is stable and
robust at low and moderate density ratios ( ρ ρl

when Gw > 0, the ρ−based interaction performs much better than

fore formulated in Reference 285 for liquid contact angles with Gw > 0

When the fluid–solid interaction force is exerted on the lattice
nodes adjacent to the solid wall, it can be found that the mechan-
ical stability condition at these lattice nodes will be affected. As a
result, the liquid-gas coexistence densities at these lattice nodes will
be changed. This is the reason why the maximum and minimum
densities deviate from the equilibrium liquid and gas densities, re-
spectively [285]. Moreover, it should be noted that the status of the
fluid–fluid interaction force (namely Eq. (75)) at the solid wall will
also affect the contact angle according to Young’s law. For a given
contact angle, the values of Gw are usually different between the cases
with and without the fluid-fluid interaction force at the solid wall.
Although substantial progress has been made in simulating
contact angles with the pseudopotential LB method, many more
efforts are still required to address several critical issues, such as
the large spurious currents around the three-phase contact line in
the cases with low relaxation times and the problem that the value
of the contact angle cannot be simply prescribed before simula-
tions. Recently, Hu et al. [286] presented an alternative treatment
to implement contact angles in the pseudopotential LB modeling
of wetting based on the geometric formulation approach, which was
proposed by Ding and Spelt [287] within the framework of the phase-
field method and has been demonstrated to be capable of exactly
reproducing a given contact angle. The geometric formulation ap-
proach will be reviewed in Section 4.4.

3.6. Thermal models for liquid-vapor phase change

In this subsection, the thermal pseudopotential LB models for
simulating liquid-vapor phase change are reviewed. Historically, the
first thermal pseudopotential LB model may be attributed to Zhang
and Chen [94]. They devised a new force expression and success-
fully modeled the nucleate boiling. Later, an important contribution
was made by Házi and Márkus [95,96], who established the target

In the thermal pseudopotential LB method, the liquid-vapor phase
change is driven by the equation of state pEOS . Hence no artificial
phase-change terms need to be added to the temperature
equation. A similar treatment can also be found in References
289,290. With such a treatment, the rate of the liquid-vapor
phase change is a computational output rather than a prerequisite
input.

Since v·∇T and ∇ ∇⋅ (

In 2012, Biferale et al. [98] proposed a three-dimensional thermal

part of the equation of state, p
model by modifying the equilibrium density distribution func-
tion. Similar treatments can be found in the free-energy and the
color-gradient multiphase LB models. It is now widely accepted that,

when the equation of state or the pressure is changed by modify-
ing the equilibrium density distribution function, the Galilean
invariance is lost [42,43]. Some correction terms, which usually
involve the derivatives of the density, should be added to either the
equilibrium distribution function or the LB equation to restore the
Galilean invariance [42,43,137].

Gong and Cheng [99,100] have also proposed a thermal
pseudopotential LB model and simulated bubble growth and de-
parture. The model has been applied to simulate film condensation
by Liu and Cheng [101]. In 2013, Kamali et al. [102] constructed a
thermal pseudopotential LB model based on the energy conserva-
tion equation of mixtures and successfully simulated the evaporation
of a liquid film upon heating. Similarly, in Kamali et al.’s work the
energy equation was mimicked by a thermal LB equation with a
source term. Here it is stressed again that, when a thermal LB equa-
tion is employed together with a multiphase LB model, special
attention should be paid to the correct recovery of the target tem-
perature or energy equation. Some error terms, which are very small
in single-phase incompressible flows, are non-negligible in
multiphase flows. Li and Luo [195] have shown that, in the
pseudopotential LB modeling of thermal flows, the error term in
the recovered energy equation will lead to significant numerical
errors. Recently, Li et al. [104] developed a hybrid thermal
pseudopotential LB model, in which the pseudopotential LB method
was used to simulate the density and velocity fields and a finite-
difference scheme was employed to solve Eq. (121). Its applications
will be discussed in Section 5.3.

3.7. Multi-component formulations

Besides its use in modeling single-component multiphase flows,
the pseudopotential LB method has also been widely applied to sim-
ulate multi-component multiphase flows. Here we briefly summarize
the multi-component formulations of the pseudopotential LB
method. For multi-component systems, the fluid–fluid interaction
force is given by [12,31,243]

form of the pseudopotential ψk and the initial densities. Some em-

[248,292], and the square-
root form adopted in several studies [294,295]. In spite of the fact
that much progress has been achieved in the multi-component
pseudopotential LB method, significant efforts are still required as
its theory is far from being complete.

problem, they extended He et al.’s forcing scheme to multi-

scheme was employed, the velocity used in the equilibrium
distribution function and the forcing term is defined as

The latter treatment is seemingly more reasonable, but further
studies are still needed to clarify this issue.

In Section 3.1.3 we have mentioned that Sbragaglia and
Belardinelli [248] demonstrated that the discrete form of the pres-
sure tensor should also be used in the multi-component
pseudopotential LB models. For single-component models, it has
been shown that the discrete form pressure tensor leads to a me-
chanical stability condition like Eq. (90), from which the coexistence
densities can be analytically obtained via numerical integration.
Meanwhile, the form of the pseudopotential can be determined ac-
cording to thermodynamic consistency or the requirement of
reproducing a non-ideal equation of state in the thermodynamic
theory. When the thermodynamic consistency is satisfied or ap-
proximately restored, the coexistence densities obtained from the
Maxwell construction can serve as the initial densities in numer-

4.1.1. Governing equations

The phase-field theory is a descendant of van der Waals [296]
and Cahn–Hilliard’s [297,298] classical field theoretical approaches,
in which the local state of matter is represented continuously by a
) that moni-
single variable known as the order parameter φ x, t
tors the transition between different states or phases. The set of
values of the order parameter over the whole occupied space is the
so-called phase-field.

merical performances of these two forms are usually different as
the variations of φ and μφ across the interface are different. There
are also some other forms of the surface tension force, which can
be found in Reference 301. Khan [302] remarked that the exis-
tence of so many forms of the surface tension force is because further
efforts are needed to simulate the problems with large density and
viscosity ratios.

The coupled Cahn–Hilliard–Navier–Stokes equations, Eqs. (132),
(133), and (134), have been demonstrated to be valid for both
density-matched binary fluids [65,303] and two-phase fluid flows
with a density contrast [304]. For density-matched binary fluids,
the density ρ in Eq. (134) is the average density, which is nearly a
constant, while for two-phase fluid flows the density ρ is function-
al of the order parameter φ.

4.2.1. Early models

In 1999, He et al. [45] proposed an incompressible LB model for
simulating multiphase flows, in which they used an index func-
tion to track the interface between different phases. Two distribution
functions were employed in the model, the index distribution func-
tion fα and the pressure distribution function gα, which satisfy the
following evolution equations [45,308]:

where λφ is related to the relaxation time. In Reference 309, Eq. (148)
was interpreted as a level-set-like equation. Lee and Lin [310] pointed
out such an interpretation is not appropriate. It is more appropri-
ate to regard Eq. (148) as a Cahn–Hilliard-like equation. From this
point, He et al.’s model is the first phase-field LB model for incom-
pressible multiphase flows. Nevertheless, this model was found to
be limited to moderate density ratios.

Later, an incompressible multiphase LB model was proposed by
Inamuro et al. [46] for multiphase flows at large density ratios.
Inamuro et al.’s model also utilized two different particle distribu-
tion functions: one for the order parameter and the other for solving
the velocity field without the pressure gradient. The model is then
supplemented by a relationship between the velocity correction and
the pressure gradient, which is determined by solving a Poisson equa-
tion at every collision-streaming step. Inamuro et al. [46] showed
that their model recovers the following macroscopic equations:

where θM is the mobility coefficient, P is the thermodynamic pres-

Equation (149) is the recovered phase-field advection-diffusion equa-
tion for the order parameter φ. Using the model, Inamuro et al.
successfully simulated rising bubbles in a square duct at the density
ratio ρ ρl

g = 1000 .

In 2005, Lee and Lin [47] devised a three-stage stabilized LB model
for simulating incompressible multiphase flows at large density
ratios. Similarly, two particle distribution functions were used in
their model: the density distribution function fα and the pressure
distribution function gα, which obey the following discrete
Boltzmann–BGK equations, respectively

Lee and Lin pointed out that μ c s

2 in Eq. (154) acts as the mo-
bility in the Cahn–Hilliard-like equation [47]; thus in this model the
density ρ serves as the order parameter. To stabilize the LB scheme
at large density ratios, the second-order discretizations of Eqs. (152)
and (153) were solved in three steps and the gradient terms were
evaluated using different forms before and after the streaming step
[47]. A second-order mixed difference scheme, which is a combi-
nation of a second-order central difference scheme and a second-
order biased difference scheme, was introduced to evaluate some
spatial derivatives, e.g., for the directional derivatives (of a vari-
able φ), the second-order central and biased difference schemes are

Numerical results showed that Lee and Lin’s model is capable
of simulating multiphase flows at the density ratio ρ ρl
g = 1000 .
Nevertheless, Chiappini et al. [311] analytically demonstrated that
the different discretization of the streaming operator along the di-
rections of molecular versus fluid motion is in principle non-
conservative. Lou et al. [312] also found that the second-order mixed
difference scheme, which plays a critical role in Lee and Lin’s model
for enhancing the numerical stability at large density ratios, is non-
Galilean invariant and does not conserve the total mass of the system.
Meanwhile, it was shown [312] that the second-order isotropic dif-
ference scheme (see the appendix in Reference 47 or Eqs. (73) and
(74) in the present paper) can ensure that the total mass of the
system is conserved, although the isotropic difference scheme is
seemingly inefficient at large density ratios.

4.2.2. Improved models

In 2006, Zheng et al. [48] pointed out that the above three models
cannot correctly recover the Cahn–Hilliard equation, which can be
seen by comparing Eqs. (148), (149), and (154) with Eq. (132). A
new model was therefore developed in Reference 48. To recover the
Cahn–Hilliard equation, Zheng et al. [48] proposed a modified LB
equation for the order parameter distribution function

that their model works well at the density ratio ρ ρl
g = 1000 for
static cases. For dynamic multiphase flows, the achievable highest
liquid-gas density ratio decreases to around 10.

In 2010, Lee and Liu [49] proposed a modified phase-field LB
model based on Lee and Lin’s model [47]. In the modified model,
the pressure distribution function gα still obeys the discrete
Boltzmann equation given by Eq. (153), but the density distribu-
tion function fα is replaced by an order parameter distribution
function hα, which satisfies the following equation so as to recover
the Cahn–Hilliard equation [49]:

To enhance the numerical stability at large density ratios, the
second-order mixed difference scheme was employed to evaluate
some spatial derivatives; thus the weakness of the mixed differ-
ence scheme [312] was retained.

Wang et al. [67] have developed a multiphase LB flux solver for
simulating incompressible multiphase flows at large density ratios
and high Reynolds numbers. The LB flux solver was based on the
following hydrodynamic equations:

The above equations were then transformed to the governing
equation of the density distribution function, which was solved by
the finite-volume method and the flow variables were updated using
a third-order Total-Variation-Diminishing (TVD) Runge–Kutta tem-
poral scheme. The convective Cahn–Hilliard equation was solved
with the finite-difference method and the convective term
was discretized by a fifth-order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory
(WENO) scheme [67]. Owing to the use of these contact disconti-
nuity capturing schemes, which are widely adopted in the
simulations of compressible flows with shock waves [179,316–318],
the multiphase LB flux solver works well at the density ratio of
1000 [67]. Recently, Wang et al. [319] have improved their
multiphase LB flux solver and developed a three-dimensional version
using the D3Q15 lattice. Some numerical results can be found in
Fig. 11.

Similarly, in a recent study carried out by Shao and Shu [68], the
convective Cahn–Hilliard equation was solved with a third-order
TVD Runge–Kutta scheme for the temporal discretization and an
upwind WENO scheme for discretizing the convection term. The in-
compressible Navier–Stokes equations were still mimicked by an
LB model [68]. Using such a hybrid phase-field LB model, Shao and
Shu [68] successfully simulated droplet splashing at ρ ρl
g = 1000
and Re = 500. Their work implies that the numerical stability of a
phase-field LB model at large density ratios may mainly depend on
the solver for the Cahn–Hilliard equation.

4.3. Hydrodynamic inconsistency

In 2012, Li et al. [50] found that, in most of the previous incom-
pressible multiphase LB models, the recovered momentum equation
is inconsistent with the target momentum equation of incompress-
ible multiphase flows, i.e., Eq. (134). Most of the above-mentioned
models use the pressure distribution function gα to simulate the
Navier–Stokes equations and the equilibrium pressure distribu-
tion function g eq

α usually satisfies

Previously it has been mentioned that the phase-field theory is
valid for both density-matched binary fluids and two-phase fluids
with a density contrast. For density-matched binary fluids, the
density ρ in Eq. (134) is the average density. The first LB model for
binary fluids was devised by Swift et al. [41]. A couple of LB models
for binary fluids can also be found in Xu et al.’s studies [313–315].
Actually, Zheng et al.’s model is also an LB model for density-
matched binary fluids since the density in Eqs. (163) and (164) is
)
the average density n
B 2. This point was demonstrated by
Fakhari and Rahimian [305], who showed that Zheng et al.’s model
gives the same results for the cases with an equal average density,
e.g., for the case nA = 1 and nB = 1000 with the case nA = 500 and
nB = 501, which can be seen in Fig. 10.

To simulate two-phase fluid flows with a density contrast,
Fakhari and Rahimian [305] presented a modified phase-field LB
model based on Zheng et al.’s work. A similar LB equation was
used to mimic the Cahn–Hilliard equation. Meanwhile, following
the line of He et al.’s work [45], Fakhari and Rahimian employed
the pressure distribution function gα to solve the incompressible

Obviously, an additional term F
a

is included
in the recovered momentum equation as compared with Eq. (134).
According to Eq. (172), Fa is zero in every single-phase region but
nonzero at the interface. Li et al. [50] pointed out that Fa can be in-
terpreted as an additional interfacial force and can be eliminated
by adding −Fa into the forcing term of the LB model. It was numer-
ically found that [50], with the increase of the velocity or the
Reynolds number, the additional interfacial force gradually has an
important influence on the evolution of the interface and affects the
numerical accuracy, which can be seen in Fig. 12.

from that of Eq. (134) because [50]

of the order parameter φ. As a result, the usual mass conservation

It can be found that, when the phase-field theory with a Cahn–
Hilliard-like interface capturing equation is applied, the
incompressibility condition and the usual mass conversation cannot
be simultaneously satisfied at the interface (the mixing layer)
[65,300,304].

Hence the recovered momentum equation (170) should be re-

written as

In some recent studies of the phase-field multiphase LB method
[51,320,321], the elimination of the additional interfacial force was
taken into account. In addition, Liu et al. [51] found that a similar
error term exists in the recovered Cahn–Hilliard equation of Lee and
Liu’s model if the additional interfacial force is not eliminated (see
eq. (30)-eq. (32) in Reference 51). Moreover, Liang et al. [320] have
proposed an improved LB–MRT model to solve the Cahn–Hilliard
equation. A source term was added to the LB–MRT equation to
remove the error term in the recovered Cahn–Hilliard equation. Liang
et al. showed that their LB–MRT model is better than some previ-
ous models in terms of numerical accuracy and stability. Recently,
Zheng et al. [322] have also constructed an improved LB model for
the Cahn–Hilliard equation.

Finally, it should be noted that, although mass conservation
+
t ρ
∂
0 is not satisfied at the interface when the incom-
pressibility condition is imposed, the total mass of the whole system
can be conserved as long as there is no interfacial diffusion flux across
the boundaries (M∇μφ denotes the interfacial diffusion flux), which
can be found by integrating Eq. (172) over the occupied space and
then using the divergence theorem [304]. Hence, in phase-field
models, the no-flux boundary condition should be applied to the
chemical potential μφ, i.e., n·∇μφ = 0, where n is the normal unit
vector.

4.4. The contact angle treatment

In this section, the approaches used in the phase-field method

for simulating contact angles are briefly reviewed.

4.4.1. The surface energy density

In the phase-field method, the first study about the implemen-
tation of contact angles might be attributed to Cahn [323], who
assumed that the interaction between the solid surface and the fluid
is sufficiently short-range so that it contributes a surface term to
the total free energy of the system. With such an assumption, the
free energy defined by Eq. (129) can be rewritten as [324,325]

(174)

where S is the solid surface bounding the volume V, φs is the value
of φ on the solid surface, and the surface energy density H φs(
) rep-
resents the influence of the surface on the free energy.

To implement wetting boundaries in the phase-field method, the
key issue is to find the relationship between the boundary condi-
tion of the order parameter φ and the value of the contact angle θW.
According to Reference 324, the natural boundary condition of φ is
given by

posed in the literature. The simplest H φs(

becomes

(176)

From Eq. (176) it can be seen that the boundary condition of φ
has been linked to λc. Meanwhile, the contact angle can be deter-
mined by the Young’s law [324]

where θ, θsg , and θsl are the liquid-gas, solid-gas, and solid-liquid
surface tensions, respectively. For the linear surface energy density
(

For a given contact angle, the value of λc can be obtained from

Moreover, Pooley et al. [329] have investigated the perfor-
mances of the BGK and MRT collisions models when the above
approach is employed to implement the contact angles. It was found
that, for the BGK collision model, strong spurious currents appear
when the relaxation time τ ≠ 1. Pooley et al. demonstrated that the
spurious currents mainly arise from two effects: the long-range con-
tribution to the equilibrium distribution function near the contact
line and the bounce-back boundary treatment. They suggested using
the MRT collision model for cases when the simulated two
components/phases have different viscosities. Recently, Taghilou and
Rahimian [330] successfully applied the above approach to simu-
late the penetration of a liquid droplet in a porous media with
wetting boundaries. Some numerical results can be found in Fig. 13.
Besides the linear form of the surface energy density, some other
forms can be found in References 331–333. For example, a qua-
dratic form surface energy density and a cubic form surface energy
density were proposed in Reference 331, with the relationship
between the boundary condition of φ and the contact angle being
derived in a similar way. Numerical investigations on the perfor-
mances of these different forms have been conducted by Liu and
Lee [331] and Huang et al. [333].

4.4.2. The geometric formulation

In 2007, Ding and Spelt [287] found that the approach based on
the surface energy density cannot give a slope of the interface that
is completely consistent with the prescribed value of the contact
angle. The detailed explanations can be found in Section II.B in Ref-
erence 287. To solve this problem, Ding and Spelt proposed a
geometric formulation to implement wetting boundaries in the
phase-field method.

4.5. Thermal models for liquid-vapor phase change

(183)

where n is the unit vector normal to the wall and ns = −∇ ∇φ φ
is the normal unit vector.

Equation (183) is the so-called geometric formulation for com-
puting the contact angle θW. Its discretized form (using a central
finite-difference scheme) is given by [287]

In this section, the thermal phase-field LB models for simulat-
ing liquid-vapor phase change are reviewed. The existing thermal
phase-field LB models can be classified into three types. The first-
type thermal phase-field LB model was proposed by Dong et al. [106]
based on Zheng et al.’s binary-fluid model, in which the phase change
was defined by adding a source term to the Cahn–Hilliard equa-
tion:

Here the index i represents the coordinate along the solid wall.
Ding and Spelt [287] pointed out that the geometric formulation
can provide a good approximation for the contact angle θW as long
as enough grid points (usually 4–8) are used to resolve the inter-
face and the diffuse interface is at equilibrium or near equilibrium
at the solid substrate. It was found [287] that the geometric for-
mulation gives more accurate results in comparison with the surface-
energy-density-based approach. Nevertheless, it should also be noted
that the geometric formulation requires more neighboring infor-
mation; therefore, its application to rough surfaces may need more
careful treatment.

rameter φ ranges from −φ∗ to φ∗, but the complete Eqs. (185) and
(186) are only applied in the region φ < 0; when φ ≥ 0, the source
terms are ignored. In other words, the phase change terms are con-
sidered in the vapor region only [106]. The model has been employed
to simulate bubble growth on and departure from a superheated
wall [106–108] and has been extended to three dimensions by Sun
and Li [109]. Some numerical results can be found in Fig. 15.

The second-type thermal phase-field LB model was developed
by Safari et al. [110,111] based on Lee and Liu’s isothermal phase-

by redefining the divergence of the velocity field. From the conti-

where λ is the thermal conductivity and hfg is the latent heat of

lating a one-dimensional Stefan problem and two-dimensional
droplet evaporation. Recently, this model has been applied by
Begmohammadi et al. to simulate bubble growth on and depar-
ture from a superheated wall [112]. Using Lee and Liu’s mixed
difference scheme, Begmohammadi et al. successfully simulated
bubble growth at a large density ratio ( ρ ρl
g = 1000 ). With the mass
flux defined by Eq. (189), an initial small bubble is often placed on
the wall for simulating bubble growth because there will be no
liquid-vapor phase change when the order parameter φ is uniform
in the whole computational domain.

The third type of thermal phase-field LB model was devised
by Tanaka et al.
Inamuro et al.’s
[113] on the basis of
isothermal phase-field model [46]. Similar to the thermal
pseudopotential LB models, Tanaka et al.’s model also employs
φ
2
a
the temperature T in the equation of state p
[113] to drive the phase change from the liquid state to vapor
state. Hence in Tanaka et al.’s model the rate of the liquid-vapor
phase change is also a computational output, while in the above
two types of thermal phase-field LB models, the phase change
rate is a prerequisite input. Owing to this feature, the bubble
growth and departure can be simulated by Tanaka et al.’s
model without placing an initial bubble on the superheated wall
[113,114].

5. Some applications of multiphase and thermal LB methods

In the above sections, we have introduced the fundamentals of
the LB method and reviewed the advances in the theories of two
popular multiphase LB methods. In this section we shall review some
applications of these two multiphase LB methods as well as the ap-
plication of thermal LB approaches in energy storage with phase
change materials.

5.1. Fuel cells and batteries

A fuel cell, which consists of an anode, a cathode, a membrane,
and an electrolyte, is an energy conversion device that converts the
chemical energy stored in fuels and oxidants into electricity through
electrochemical reactions [336,337]. Fuel cells can be classified into
different types according to the electrolyte in use, among which the
proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, also known as the
polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, is widely regarded as one
of the most promising types of fuel cells [336,338–340] due to its
advantages such as low operating temperature, high power density,
and zero/low emission. There are many phenomena involved in a
PEM fuel cell, e.g., heat transfer, species and charge transport,
multiphase flows, and electrochemical reactions. In particular, the
water-gas two-phase flow in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) has been
identified as an important phenomenon because it affects the amount
of water in the catalyst layer and membrane, and plays a crucial role
in the water management of PEM fuel cells.

In the literature, the first attempt of applying a multiphase LB
model to simulate the water-gas transport in the GDL of a PEM fuel
cell was attributed to Niu et al. [73] and Sinha et al. [74] in 2007.
By employing a three-dimensional MRT version of Zheng et al.’s
binary-fluid phase-field LB model, Niu et al. [73] investigated the

effects of the pressure drop, the wettability, and the viscosity ratio
on the liquid-gas transport process in the GDL of a PEM fuel cell.
They observed that an increase in the viscosity ratio results in a de-
creased relative permeability of the liquid phase. Meanwhile, Sinha
et al. [74] utilized a multi-component pseudopotential LB model to
simulate the liquid water distribution in an initially air-saturated
carbon paper GDL. The influence of the capillary pressure was in-
vestigated and some results can be found in Fig. 16, which show
that, at a low capillary pressure, the invading front overcomes the
barrier pressure only at some preferential locations depending upon
the pore size. With the increase of the capillary pressure, it can be
seen that the liquid water gradually penetrates into the domain oc-
cupied by air. Moreover, the difference of the liquid water distribution
between a hydrophobic GDL and a mixed wettability GDL has also
been studied [74].

Later, Koido et al. [75] employed a combination of the standard
single-phase LB method and the pseudopotential LB method to
predict the relative permeabilities of liquid and gas phases versus
the saturation of the GDL of a PEM fuel cell. The shape of the curve
of the experimentally measured gas-phase relative permeability was
correctly captured by the numerical prediction. The effect of
wettability on the liquid water distribution in the GDL was also in-
vestigated. It was found that the liquid water tends to be present
in large pores as spheres in a hydrophobic GDL and in small pores
as thin films in a hydrophilic GDL [75]. In the meantime, by adopt-
ing the pseudopotential LB method, Park and Li [76] carried out a
numerical study on the two-phase flow through a complicated
porous medium, which represents a carbon paper GDL.

In 2009, using Inamuro et al.’s phase-field LB model, Tabe et al.
[77] studied the dynamic behavior of condensed water and gas flow
in a PEM fuel cell with a simplified GDL. Their results showed that
the wettability of the flow channel has a strong effect on the two-

91

phase flow in PEM fuel cells. Tabe et al. suggested that controlling
the wettability of the porous separator can be used to produce an
efficient distribution of the water and gas flow. At the same time,
Mukherjee et al. [78] employed the pseudopotential LB method
coupled with the stochastic microstructure reconstruction method
to investigate the influences of the pore structure and the surface
wettability on the liquid water transport, and the flooding dynam-
ics in the catalyst layer and the GDL of a PEM fuel cell. In addition,
Hao and Cheng [79] used a binary-fluid phase-field LB model to sim-
ulate the formation and removal of water droplets in the micro-
gas flow channel of a PEM fuel cell. It was found that increasing the
gas flow velocity and enhancing the GDL hydrophobicity can promote
the formation of small droplets and thus reduce the time of water
droplets adhering to the GDL surface near the emergence pore. More-
over, Hao and Cheng [80,81] have also studied the effect of wettability
on the water transport dynamics in a carbon paper GDL. It was
shown that, for high hydrophobicity, the water transport in the GDL
falls into the regime of capillary fingering, whereas for neutral
wettability, the water transport exhibits stable displacement char-
acteristics even for a capillary force dominated flow.

Zhou and Wu [82] have applied the pseudopotential LB method
to study the liquid water transport mechanism in the GDLs of PEM
fuel cells. It was found that the distribution of the fibers and the
spatial mixed-wettability play an important role in the liquid water
transport. Chen et al. [83] investigated the pore-scale flow and mass
transport in the GDL of an interdigitated PEM fuel cell using the
pseudopotential LB method. The GDL was reconstructed with the
stochastic microstructure reconstruction method. They showed that
the pore-scale behavior of the liquid water in the GDL can be clas-
sified as slow creeping in the regions with slow air flow and quick
moving in the regions with fast air flow. Ben Salah et al. [84] uti-
lized Inamuro et al.’s phase-field LB model to study the droplet
behavior in the gas flow channel of a PEM fuel cell. They found that
hydrophilic channel walls result in better gas transport character-
istics than hydrophobic walls. Using the pseudopotential LB method,
Han et al. [85] have also studied the liquid droplet dynamics in the
gas flow channel of a PEM fuel cell. The development and interac-
tion of two liquid droplets were simulated. It was found that
increasing the gas stream velocity and the liquid pore distance can
prevent the interaction of liquid droplets and enhance the removal
of droplets. In addition, Han and Meng [86] have simulated the liquid
water transport in two different types of serpentine gas channels
of PEM fuel cells. They found that a smooth U-shaped turning region
is beneficial to the liquid water removal in a serpentine gas channel.
Moreover, Han and Meng [87] have applied the pseudopotential
LB method to investigate the interfacial phenomena of liquid water
transport in the porous diffusion layers of PEM fuel cells. They
showed that the liquid water moves preferentially through the
regions with large perforated pores. In addition, Gao et al. [88] have
simulated the water and gas flow in porous GDLs reconstructed from
micro-tomography and found that, with an increase in hydropho-
bicity, the liquid water transport in GDLs changes from piston flow
to channel flow. Recently, using the pseudopotential LB method,
Molaeimanesh and Akbari [89] studied the two-phase flow through
the GDL of a PEM fuel cell with the non-homogeneous and aniso-
tropic transport properties being considered. Furthermore, they have
studied the pore-scale flows in three reconstructed GDLs with dif-
ferent anisotropic parameters using a three-dimensional
pseudopotential LB model [90]. Some results can be found in Fig. 17.
In case a the carbon fibers are mostly oriented normal to the cat-
alyst layer, while in case c the carbon fibers are mostly oriented
parallel to the catalyst layer. The results showed that, when the
carbon fibers are more likely oriented normal to the catalyst layer,
the distributions of the oxygen and water vapor become more dis-
turbed. Moreover, Kim et al. [91] have investigated the effects of
in PEM fuel cells using the
micro-porous layers (MPLs)

pseudopotential LB method. It was found that the liquid water inside
the GDL is reduced as the thickness of the MPLs increases.

Recently, the LB method has also been applied to batteries
[92,93,341]. The first study was conducted by Qiu et al. [341]. In
their study, the flow of electrolyte through the pore space in a va-
nadium redox flow battery [342] was modeled by the standard
single-phase LB method with the species and charge transport being
solved using the finite-volume method. Recently, Lee et al. [92] suc-
cessfully applied the pseudopotential multiphase LB method to
simulate the dynamic behavior of a liquid electrolyte in the porous
electrode of a lithium-ion battery, which is a member of recharge-
able batteries family. In lithium-ion batteries, the lithium ions move
from the negative electrode to the positive electrode during the dis-
charge process and move back when charging. Lee et al. found that
the wettability in a porous electrode was strongly affected by the
two-phase liquid electrolyte and gas flow, and enhanced wettability
can be achieved through controlling the material properties. Fur-
thermore, Lee and Jeon [93] have studied the influence of the
electrode compression ratio on the wettability of a lithium-ion
battery. Some results can be found in Fig. 18: it can be seen that a
higher compression ratio leads to a reduced liquid electrolyte
distribution.

5.2. Droplet collisions

Understanding droplet collisions is of crucial importance in many
industrial processes such as inkjet printing, spray cooling, and spray
combustion [343]. Here droplet collisions include droplet–droplet
collisions and droplet–wall collisions. The first study of droplet col-
lisions in the LB community may be attributed to Schelkle and Frohn
[344], who applied the pseudopotential LB method to simulate binary
collisions between equal-size droplets. Owing to the limitations of
the original pseudopotential LB model, the liquid-gas density ratio,
the Reynolds number, and the Weber number in Schelkle and Frohn’s
study are relatively low.

In 2004, Inamuro et al. [46,345] studied binary droplet colli-
sions at a high Reynolds number (Re = 2000) with their phase-
field LB model. The liquid-gas density ratio is 50. Three types of
collisions were reproduced, i.e., coalescence collision, reflexive sep-
aration collision, and stretching separation collision. The results of
a stretching separation collision can be found in Fig. 19. The impact

+
parameter is defined as B X R
2 , where R1 and R2 are the initial
radii of the two droplets, respectively, and X is the distance between
the centers of the droplets, perpendicular to their direction of motion.
It can be seen that at t* = 1.38 only a portion of the droplets con-
tacts directly due to the high impact parameter. The remaining
portions of the droplets still move in the direction of their initial
velocities and the collision finally leads to two major droplets with
a small satellite droplet [345].

Later, Premnath and Abraham [346] studied binary droplet col-
lisions using both axisymmetric and three-dimensional MRT versions
of He et al.’s multiphase LB model. For head-on collisions, it was
shown that the droplet coalescence occurs at low Weber numbers
and the coalesced droplet entraps a micro-bubble. When the Weber
number increases, the colliding droplets separate rather than co-
alescing permanently. Furthermore, the effects of the droplet size
ratio were also studied in Premnath and Abraham’s work [346]. Sim-
ilarly, Sakakibara and Inamuro [347] have investigated binary
collisions of two unequal-size droplets with a three-dimensional
version of Inamuro et al.’s phase-field LB model. They showed that
the available theoretical prediction of the boundary between the
coalescence collision and the stretching separation collision fails in
the case of a low diameter ratio (0.25). Furthermore, Mukherjee and
Abraham [348] have simulated collisions between a droplet and a
flat solid wall with an axisymmetric version of He et al.’s model.
They reported two outcomes of droplet–wall collisions: deposi-

were observed under different Weber numbers, Reynolds numbers,
and surface wettability. They found that large Ohnesorge numbers

Re) can prevent the phenomenon of bubble entrap-
ment from occurring. In addition, using Inamuro et al.’s phase-
field LB model, Tanaka et al. [351] have simulated the collision of
a falling droplet with a stationary droplet on a solid surface. The
influence of the Weber number on the dynamic behavior of the drop-
lets and the mixing process of the collision were studied. Shen et al.
[352] have investigated droplet collisions on the surface of a cir-
cular pipe with the pseudopotential LB method. They found that
the droplets drip down on hydrophilic surfaces and splash when
the impact velocity increases, while on hydrophobic surfaces the
droplets splash even at a small impact velocity.

Zhang et al. [70] have also simulated droplet collisions on a cir-
cular pipe. A high density ratio ( ρ ρl
g = 580) was achieved using
Li et al.’s improved MRT forcing scheme for the pseudopotential LB
models. According to the dynamic behavior of the droplets, three
temporal states were observed: the initial droplet deformation state,
the inertia dominated state, and the viscosity dominated state. The
effects of the Reynolds number, the Weber number, and the Galileo
number on the dynamic behavior were analyzed. Later, Zhang et al.
[71,353] studied three-dimensional droplet collisions on flat and
spherical surfaces using a three-dimensional pseudopotential LB
model. Recently, Lycett-Brown et al. [354] investigated three-
dimensional binary droplet collisions with a cascaded
pseudopotential LB model. Head-on and off-center collisions were
mimicked under various Weber and Reynolds numbers. More-
over, Lycett-Brown et al. [354] have studied the effects of the droplet
size ratio and found that the numerical errors (compared with the
theoretical analysis) decrease as the droplet size ratio increases.

Sun et al. [355] have investigated head-on collisions of equal-
size droplets and unequal-size droplets using an axisymmetric phase-
field LB model. They found that, in the axial deformation cases,
“coalescence” occurs at a low Weber number and “reflexive sepa-
ration with satellite droplets” appears at a high Weber number.
Moreover, by incorporating Li et al.’s axisymmetric LB–MRT scheme
[143] into Lee et al.’s phase-field LB model, Sun et al. [72] success-
fully simulated head-on collisions of unequal-size droplets at a large
density ratio ( ρ ρl
g = 830) and a low viscosity. It was shown that,
in the cases of low Ohnesorge numbers, the smaller droplet tends

tion and rebound, and found that the transition between deposition
and rebound is influenced by the Weber number, the Ohnesorge
number, and the advancing and receding static contact angles.

. Re .

In 2010, Gupta and Kumar [349] employed a three-dimensional
pseudopotential LB model to simulate droplet collisions on a dry
solid wall. The effects of the impact Reynolds number, the Weber
number, and the Ohnesorge number were analyzed with the density
ratio around 10. It was found that the maximum spreading factor
obeys the power law 0 5
. In the meantime, Lee and Liu [49]
investigated micro-scale droplet-wall collisions at a large density
ratio ( ρ ρl
g ≈ 842) using their phase-field LB model. Some results
can be found in Fig. 20, from which the spreading and retraction
processes can be clearly observed. In addition, it can be seen that
the droplet rebounds in the final stage but fails to lift off from the
solid surface. Lee and Liu [49] found that the influence of the Weber
number emerges in the later stage of spreading. Lycett-Brown et al.
[66] have studied binary droplet collisions using a multi-speed
pseudopotential LB model. The simulations were conducted at a large
density ratio but small Reynolds and Weber numbers.

Furthermore, Huang et al. [350] have investigated the phenom-
enon of bubble entrapment during the collision of a droplet on a
solid wall with a phase-field LB model. Four types of entrapment

to penetrate deeply into the larger one. With the increase of the
Ohnesorge number, the smaller droplet spreads on the surface of
the larger one. Recently, Zhou et al. [356] studied collisions between
multiple droplets and a solid wall with a phase-field LB model. Some
results of two droplets can be found in Fig. 21. It can be seen that
in the early stage, the two droplets behave independently of each
other. Later, during the spreading process the two droplets contact
each other. Subsequently, droplet coalescence occurs and a large
droplet is formed. The collisions between an array of droplets and
a solid wall have also been studied in Zhou et al.’s work.

5.3. Boiling and evaporation

Boiling heat transfer is used in a wide field of applications: from
cooking activities in everyday life to various energy conversion and

heat exchange systems as well as cooling of high-energy-density
power/electronic devices [357,358], such as boiling water reactors
in nuclear power plants. While boiling phenomena can be encoun-
tered in daily life, the boiling processes are extremely complex and
elusive because many physical components are involved and in-
terrelated, such as the nucleation, growth, departure, and coalescence
of vapor bubbles, the transport of latent heat, and the instability
of liquid-vapor interfaces [290].

Boiling of stationary or non-flowing fluid is known as pool boiling
with three boiling stages: nucleate boiling, transition boiling, and
film boiling [359]. Nucleate boiling, which is a very efficient mode
of heat transfer, occurs when the temperature of the heating surface
is higher than the saturated fluid temperature by a certain amount
but the heat flux is below the critical heat flux. Film boiling, which
is of great interest to certain applications such as quenching of steel

95

and spray cooling of very hot surfaces, appears when the surface
temperature is increased above the so-called Leidenfrost temper-
ature. In film boiling, the heating surface is completely covered with
a continuous vapor film. Transition boiling is an unstable boiling
mode between nucleate boiling and film boiling [359].

In spite of the fact that boiling heat transfer has been inten-
sively studied in the past years, many aspects of boiling are still not
well understood. For example, the physical mechanism causing the
critical heat flux has not been satisfactorily addressed, because the
correlations developed by experiments rely heavily on empirical pa-
rameters that are only valid in a narrow parameter range and
numerical simulations based on traditional numerical methods
mostly involve many assumptions and empirical correlations [360].
In Sections 3.6 and 4.5, we have introduced the thermal models for
simulating liquid-vapor phase change within the frameworks of the
pseudopotential and the phase-field multiphase LB methods. In this
section, some applications of these models are reviewed. In par-
ticular, we put our focus on boiling and evaporation. The simulations
of bubble growth and departure using point heating will not be dis-
cussed here.

The first numerical simulation of boiling using the LB method
was reported by Zhang and Chen [94]. By considering a standard
Rayleigh-Bénard setup, in which the upper and lower solid walls
obey the no-slip boundary condition and the horizontal boundary
condition is periodic, they successfully reproduced a nucleate boiling
process, which can be seen in Fig. 22. To enhance bubble forma-
tion, small temperature fluctuations were added to the equation of
state in the first grid point layer near the bottom solid wall. From
the figure, two nucleation sites can be clearly observed. In addi-
tion, the bubble rising and coalescence phenomena can also be seen
in Fig. 22. Zhang and Chen [94] have analyzed the corresponding
temperature distribution and found that the temperature is rela-
tively low in the vapor-phase domains near the liquid-vapor
interfaces.

In 2011, Márkus and Házi [96] simulated a heterogeneous boiling
process using their thermal pseudopotential LB model. A uniform
heat flux was applied at the bottom of a plate and a cavity was placed
at the center of the plate with the heat conduction in the heated
plate being taken into account. The bubble formation from the cavity
was well simulated. Later, Márkus and Házi [97] investigated the
influences of the heated plate configuration. Three different con-
figurations were considered and a film boiling process was
reproduced in the configuration when the heated plate is repre-
sented by a constant heat flux boundary. The results can be found
in Fig. 23, which shows the variation of the surface temperature
against the heat flux. From the figure a thin vapor film can be ob-
served in the case with a high heat flux. However, an important
feature of boiling heat transfer was not captured in Márkus and Házi’s
study. It is well-known that, in a surface-heat-flux-controlled boiling
system, the boiling process will instantly enter into the film boiling
regime (see Fig. 25(b), from point “C” to point “E” along the straight
line) when the surface heat flux reaches the critical heat flux, which
will result in a sharp and large increase in the surface tempera-
ture. Nevertheless, there is no such feature in Fig. 23.

In 2012, by conducting a three-dimensional simulation of nu-
cleate boiling, Biferale et al. [98] demonstrated that the
pseudopotential LB model with a non-ideal thermodynamic pres-
sure tensor can lead to a consistent definition of latent heat with
the Clausius-Clapeyron relation being satisfied. Using Tanaka et al.’s
thermal phase-field LB model, Sattari et al. [114] have also simu-
lated a boiling process (see fig. 11 in the reference). They found that
the boiling phenomenon begins with generating bubbles at the
center of a surface and then starts to spread along the surface. More-
over, Gong and Cheng [103] have investigated the effects of mixed
surface wettability on nucleate boiling heat transfer using their model
proposed in Reference 99. The corresponding target temperature

equation is similar to Eq. (190), namely the first term on the right-
hand side of Eq. (121) was replaced with ∇ ∇⋅ (
)χ T . The mixed
wettability was obtained by placing hydrophobic spots on smooth
hydrophilic surfaces. The influences of the size of the hydropho-
bic spots and the pitch distance between the hydrophobic spots were
analyzed. Gong and Cheng [103] showed that mixed wettability sur-
faces can promote bubble nucleation, enhance boiling heat transfer,
and reduce the nucleation time as compared with uniform hydro-
philic surfaces.

Recently, Li et al. [104] reproduced the three boiling stages of
pool boiling using a hybrid thermal pseudopotential LB model, as
shown in Fig. 24. In transition boiling, it can be seen that a great
portion of the heating surface is covered by vapor patches, which
essentially insulate the bulk liquid from the heating surface, while
in film boiling the whole surface is covered with a continuous vapor
film. Some other features of pool boiling heat transfer were also cap-
tured, such as the severe fluctuation of transient heat flux in the
transition boiling and the feature that the maximum heat transfer
coefficient lies at a lower wall superheat than that of the critical
heat flux. A boiling curve obtained in Li et al.’s study can be seen
in Fig. 25(a), which reproduces the features of a typical boiling curve

by Safari et al. [110] using their thermal phase-field LB model; they
simulated a two-dimensional droplet evaporation process and found
that the well-known D2 law was satisfied. The so-called D2 law was
firstly found in the study of an evaporating fuel droplet in com-
bustion [362,363], which predicts that the square of the evaporating
droplet diameter varies linearly during the lifetime of the droplet.
Later, Safari et al. [111] investigated the evaporation process of a
droplet in a laminar forced convective air environment. The effects
of the Reynolds number and the Schmidt number were studied and
compared with an empirical correlation. Recently, Ledesma-
Aguilar et al. [115] studied the evaporation of a sessile droplet on
a flat chemically patterned surface using a binary-fluid phase-
field LB model. They showed that the flow pattern of the droplet
is reversed when the contact line moves from a hydrophobic ring
to another hydrophobic ring. Moreover, Albernaz et al. [116] have
employed a thermal pseudopotential LB model to simulate droplet
evaporation under convective effects. It was shown that the evap-
oration rate increases when the convection becomes stronger.
Furthermore, they found that the evaporating droplet exhibits an
oscillatory behavior at higher Reynolds and Peclet numbers.

5.4. Energy storage with phase change materials

In recent years, phase change materials have attracted signifi-
cant attention due to their ability to store thermal energy and have
been widely used in thermal energy storage systems [358,364–368]
for heat pumps, solar engineering, and spacecraft thermal control
applications. Unlike conventional (sensible) storage materials, phase
change materials are latent heat storage materials and capable of
storing and releasing large amounts of energy at a nearly constant
temperature [368]. The solid-liquid phase change is the most used
phase change process for phase change materials. The correspond-
ing thermal energy transfer occurs when the material changes from
solid to liquid (melting), or liquid to solid (solidification) [358].

In recent years, the LB method has been extensively used to sim-
ulate solid-liquid phase change problems with complicated moving
boundaries of solid-liquid interface and variable thermophysical
properties. Generally, the existing LB models for solid-liquid phase
change problems can be classified into two major categories: the
solid-liquid phase-field LB method [369–373] and the thermal LB
method with an enthalpy-updating scheme [374–383]. Addition-
ally, a couple of models were recently constructed based on interface-
tracking methods [384,385]. In the solid-liquid phase-field LB
method, the governing equation of the order parameter, namely the
interface-capturing equation [386,387], is different from that in the
phase-field method for liquid-gas two-phase flows. This method was
first introduced by Miller et al. [369], who have applied the method
to simulate the melting of gallium, anisotropic crystal growth [370],
dendritic growth of a pure crystal [371], and binary-alloy solidifi-
cation [372]. In addition, Medvedev and Kassner [373] have
employed the solid-liquid phase-field LB method to study the crystal
growth in external flows.

The thermal LB method with an enthalpy-updating scheme is
a commonly used method in the current LB simulations of solid-
liquid phase change. Both the DDF thermal LB approach and the
hybrid thermal LB approach have been applied to investigate solid-
liquid phase change phenomena. The first work was conducted by
Jiaung et al. [374], who proposed an extended temperature-based
thermal LB model in conjunction with an enthalpy formulation in
which the interfacial position of solid-liquid phase change was de-
termined through the liquid-phase fraction. The net enthalpy is
defined as H c T
, where cpT is the sensible enthalpy and Lafl
p
is the latent enthalpy in which La is the latent heat of phase change
and fl is the liquid-phase fraction (fl = 1 and 0 represent the liquid
and solid phases, respectively). A source term was added to the
thermal LB equation to account for the latent heat source term

of pool boiling in Fig. 25(b). Moreover, they have investigated the
effects of the heating surface wettability on the boiling curve and
found that an increase in contact angle promotes the onset of boiling
but reduces the critical heat flux [104], and makes the boiling process
enter into the film boiling regime at a lower wall superheat. Similar
trends have also been found by Gong and Cheng [105].
Besides the applications in boiling heat

the
pseudopotential and the phase-field LB methods have also been
applied to simulate droplet evaporation, which is of great impor-
tance to many scientific and technical applications, such as liquid-

. Using the model, Jiaung et al. [374] successfully simu-
lated some melting and solidification problems. Nevertheless,
iterations were needed in Jiaung et al.’s work because the tran-
sient term ∂tfl was calculated by a forward finite-difference scheme
and the liquid-phase fraction at the t + δt level was a priori unknown.
Later, following the line of He et al.’s internal-energy based DDF
LB model, Chatterjee and Chakraborty [201,375,376] proposed a
series of enthalpy-based DDF LB models for solid-liquid phase
change. In their models, a fixed-grid enthalpy-porosity approach was
utilized. Moreover, the morphology of the phase change region (i.e.,
the mushy zone) was treated as an equivalent porous medium that
offers a resistance force toward the fluid flow through the phase
change region, thus one does not need to impose hydrodynamic or
thermal boundary conditions at the interface. Using the models,
Chatterjee and Chakraborty have simulated the dendritic growth
[375], the melting of gallium [201], and the Bridgman crystal growth
[376]. In addition, Chakraborty and Chatterjee [377] have pre-
sented a hybrid thermal LB model for studying convection-diffusion
phenomena with solid-liquid phase change. The thermofluidic
aspects of solid-liquid phase change were also handled with the
fixed-grid enthalpy-porosity approach, but the temperature field was
solved by a control-volume-based fully implicit finite-difference
method.

Using a modified version of Jiaung et al.’s model, Huber et al.
[378] proposed a temperature-based DDF LB model for simulating
melting coupled with natural convection. The model was em-
ployed to investigate convection melting in a porous medium. Later,
Parmigiani et al. [379] developed an LB model for simulating
multiphase flows with phase change (melting/solidification) of the
solid phase in a porous medium by coupling the pseudopotential
LB method with Huber et al.’s model. The effects of melting on the
flow of an invading non-wetting fluid in a buoyancy-driven capil-
lary channel were studied. Fig. 26 shows the influence of the Stefan
number on the stability of the non-wetting fluid channel. From the
left panel of Fig. 26 it can be seen that the non-wetting fluid channel
is well-defined and stable at a low Stefan number. However, with
the increase of the Stefan number, the channel becomes less stable
and the fluid eventually breaks into slugs or bubbles.

Gao and Chen [380] have developed a temperature-based DDF
LB model for melting with convection heat transfer in porous media
at the representative elementary (REV) scale on the basis of the gen-
eralized non-Darcy model. The effects of the Rayleigh number, Darcy
number, and porosity on the melting processes were investigated.
In addition, Liu and He [381] have presented an temperature-
based DDF LB–MRT model for solid-liquid phase change with natural
convection in porous media at the REV scale. However, to deal with

the latent heat source term, iterative schemes were used in most
of the aforementioned studies, which may greatly increase the com-
putational cost and reduce the efficiency of the model. To overcome
this drawback, Eshraghi and Felicelli [382] proposed a modified
temperature-based thermal LB model for simulating solid-liquid
phase change phenomena, in which the latent heat source term was
treated by an implicit approach, but iterations were avoided by
solving a group of linear equations. Using the model, Eshraghi and
Felicelli [382] successfully simulated binary-alloy solidification and
showed that their model is superior over the finite-element method
in terms of computational efficiency.

By combining the transient term ∂ (

pc T with the latent heat
source term ∂ (
, Huang et al. [383] developed a novel enthalpy-
based DDF LB model for solid-liquid phase change. In their model,
the equilibrium distribution function for the energy field was modi-
fied so as to recover the target governing equation of enthalpy. The
temperature field and the liquid-phase fraction were determined
by the enthalpy, which avoids iterations or solving a group of linear
equations in numerical simulations. The efficiency of the model was
demonstrated by the problems of conduction-induced melting and
melting coupled with natural convection.

Furthermore, Huang and Wu [384] have proposed an immersed
boundary DDF LB–MRT model for simulating solid-liquid phase
change problems. In the model, the usual enthalpy-updating scheme
was not used and the solid-liquid interface was viewed as a bound-
ary with no thickness immersed in the fluid and traced by the

Lagrangian grid. The velocity and thermal boundary conditions at
the solid-liquid interface were handled by the immersed bounda-
ry method. The model was successfully applied to simulate
convection melting in a circular cylinder with the motion of the solid
phase being considered. The effect of the motion of the solid phase
on the melting processes at different Fourier numbers (the Fourier
number Fo = αt lc
2 ) were investigated, which can be found in Fig. 27.
When the solid phase is free, it can be seen that the solid phase is
pushed toward the bottom of the circular cylinder as time pro-
gresses, while the fluid rises to the top. The numerical results showed
that the motion of the solid phase accelerates the melting process
[384].

Recently, Li et al. [385] have also developed an LB model for simu-
lating solid-liquid phase change. In their model, the Navier–
Stokes equations and the temperature equation were mimicked by
a DDF LB model, while the melting front location was tracked by
an interface-tracking scheme. The model has been validated by both
conduction- and convection-dominated melting problems. In some
of the aforementioned studies, the enthalpy, which consists of the
sensible enthalpy and the latent enthalpy, was claimed to be “total”
enthalpy. It should be noted that in thermodynamics the total en-
thalpy is the enthalpy at a stagnation point. For the liquid phase,
the total enthalpy contains a term associated with the kinetic energy
of the liquid [202].

Using Huang et al.’s model, Luo et al. [388] have investigated con-
vection melting in a shell-and-tube energy storage system filled with
phase change materials. The influences of the Rayleigh and Stefan
numbers as well as the arrangements of tubes on the melting dy-
namics of the shell-and-tube energy storage system were studied
in detail. The effect of the number of inner tubes can be seen in
Fig. 28. Luo et al. [388] showed that the melting time decreases as
the number of inner tubes increases, which was found to be at-
tributed to the increase of the surface area and the enhancement
of the convection around the tubes.

Furthermore, Huo and Rao [389] have employed Huang et al.’s
model to study the solid-liquid phase change phenomenon of phase
change materials under constant heat flux. Three kinds of heat flux
distributions were investigated. It was found that increasing the
uniform heat flux accelerates the rate of the solid-liquid phase change
process. Nevertheless, the ability of the phase change material for

maintaining the temperature becomes poorer after raising the heat
flux. In addition, Talati and Taghilou [390] have applied Eshraghi
and Felicelli’s model to simulate the solidification of phase change
materials within a rectangular finned container. It was shown that
the maximum required time for the solidification process of phase
change materials inside the container occurs when the container
aspect ratio equals 0.5 and changing the fin’s material from alumi-
num to copper has no significant impact on the freezing history even
at low aspect ratios.

6. Summary and outlook

As a latecomer to the family of modeling and simulation tools,
the LB method has witnessed an astonishing growth in its meth-
odology development and application over the past quarter of a
century. It fills a vital gap between the macroscopic continuum ap-
proaches such as the Navier–Stokes solvers and the particle-based
microscopic approaches such as molecular dynamics. Such a
mesoscopic approach has found applications in almost all areas of
energy and combustion. The present review has focused on
multiphase flow and phase-change heat transfer, in which the LB
method has demonstrated distinctive strengths in comparison with
both macroscopic and microscopic approaches. On the other hand,
the LB method is still an evolving methodology yet to reach its ma-
turity, where both theoretical exploration and new applications are
continually appearing.

For multiphase flows, the pseudopotential LB method and the
phase-field LB method have been particularly successful and popular.
They have been developed and applied to study the dynamics of a
wide range of multiphase flows at realistic density ratios, Reyn-
olds numbers and Weber numbers. In the latest development, the
dynamics process of droplet collision has been successfully simu-
lated by a cascaded-based pseudopotential LB model with an
improved forcing scheme at a density ratio of 1000, Reynolds number
of 6200 and Weber number of 440 [391].

In the pseudopotential multiphase LB method, the interfacial dy-
namics and phase separation are described by interparticle
interactions. As a result, in the pseudopotential LB simulation of
multiphase flows, the interface can arise, deform and migrate nat-
urally without resorting to any techniques to track or capture the
interface. In recent years, advances have been made in eliminat-
ing the thermodynamic inconsistency, reducing the spurious
currents, adjusting the surface tension and the interface thick-
ness, etc. These developments have significantly enhanced the
capability of the pseudopotential LB method for multiphase flow
simulations. It should be noted that the forcing scheme plays a very
important role in the pseudopotential LB method because it affects
the mechanical stability condition, which determines the coexis-
tence densities given by the pseudopotential LB models. Moreover,
to decouple the surface tension from the density ratio, the me-
chanical stability condition should remain unchanged. Future
developments can focus on the enhancement of numerical stabil-
ity at lower relaxation times and further reducing the spurious
currents around the three-phase contact line.

In the phase-field multiphase LB method, the interface is cap-
tured with the evolution of an order parameter, which is governed
by the Cahn–Hilliard equation or a Cahn–Hilliard-like equation. In
this paper, the basic formulations of the phase-field theory have been
described and the different definitions of interface thickness have
been clarified. Moreover, developments in the phase-field multiphase
LB method for isothermal models, elimination of hydrodynamic in-
consistency, implementation of contact angles, and thermal models
for liquid-vapor phase change have been discussed in detail. With
the aid of a mixed difference scheme or a finite-difference solver
for the Cahn–Hilliard equation, the phase-field LB method has been
successful in modeling dynamic multiphase flows at large density

ratios. Nevertheless, further efforts are still required as the mixed
difference scheme suffers from the lack of Galilean invariance.

For thermal applications, we have reviewed thermal LB ap-
proaches on standard lattices. In particular, a simplified internal-
energy-based DDF LB model and the usual temperature-based DDF
LB model have been analyzed, showing the error terms in the re-
covered macroscopic equations (see Eqs. (64), (67), and (68)). It is
worth mentioning again that, when employing a multiphase LB
model together with a thermal LB model to simulate thermal
multiphase flows, special attention should be paid to the correct
recovery of the target temperature/energy equation. Some error
terms, which may be very small in single-phase flows, are non-
negligible in multiphase flows.

Finally, applications of multiphase and/or thermal LB methods
have been highlighted for fuel cells, batteries, droplet collisions,
boiling, evaporation, and energy storage with phase change mate-
rials. For instance, the liquid-gas transport in PEM fuel cells has been
extensively investigated with the pseudopotential and the phase-
field LB methods, leading to detailed information about the dynamic
features of PEM fuel cells under various conditions. Moreover, it is
very inspiring that a typical boiling curve of pool boiling and the
three boiling stages have been numerically reproduced by the LB
method without using the empirical assumptions involved in con-
ventional algorithms. There is no doubt that ever more applications
of the LB method as a powerful mesoscopic numerical tool will be
found in a variety of fields including energy and combustion. An
important future development will be in the hybrid methods, which
will significantly expand the capability of the LB method. For
example, the combination of the LB method with the immersed
boundary method [16] can tackle phase change problems with
complex boundaries and/or solid-structure interactions, e.g., boiling
flow in rod-bundle geometries, which is a critical issue in boiling
water reactors in nuclear power plants. Furthermore, applications
of the LB method in micro energy systems and energy system anal-
ysis and optimization [392] also have great potential.
