Underground coal gasification can convert deep coal resources into synthesis gas for use in the production
of electricity, fuels and chemicals. This paper provides a review of the various methods of undertaking
underground coal gasification and observations from demonstrations of the process in the field. A general
representation of the underground process is presented, along with an identification of the various zones
and associated governing phenomena. The main factors affecting the performance of underground coal gas-
ification, such as coal rank, depth and thickness and oxidant composition and injection rate are examined in
detail. A brief assessment of the economic and environmental considerations relevant to underground coal
gasification projects is presented. Finally, guidelines for site and oxidant selection are provided based on
the learnings from prior demonstration projects.

1. Introduction

PUnderground coal gasification (UCG) is the process of converting
hydrocarbon materials into synthesis gas in-situ. Underground coal
gasification is sometimes referred to as in-situ coal gasification
(ISCG). The process has been developed over more than a century,
though only a few projects currently operate on a continuous basis.
Various articles and studies indicate that UCG is technically feasible
and economically attractive as a method to utilise the energy of
deep coal resources (e.g. [1(cid:1)6]). Recent reviews on the fundamen-
tals, applications and modelling have been reported by Bhutto et al.
[7], Shafirovich et al. [8] and Khan et al. [9], respectively. Fig. 1 shows
the worldwide locations of UCG commercial and demonstration
projects as well as areas that are thought to be prospective for car-
bon sequestration.

PIn its simplest form UCG involves: i) drilling an injection well into
the coal seam and linking it with a production well, ii) igniting the
coal seam and iii) injecting an oxidant (e.g. air, oxygen/steam etc.)
and iv) recovering syngas from the production well. In practice, the
process involves performing coal gasification within an open system
located hundreds of metres below ground and controlling it though
a limited number of injection and production wells to convert and
extract the hydrocarbons. Like surface coal gasification, under-
ground coal gasification, requires high temperatures, management
of dangerous fluids such as pure oxygen and handling of hot raw
products of syngas, tars and produced water. In addition, the process
is undertaken in a geo-reactor, wherein the natural surrounding
strata are used to contain the process and provide adequate barriers
to ensure isolation, in terms of chemical, thermal and mechanical
impacts.

PThe treated product syngas from UCG can then be used in a vari-

ety of processes such as:

P(cid:3) combustion of syngas in a combined cycle gas turbine to pro-

duce electricity (e.g. [10,11])

P(cid:3) conversion of syngas into synthetic crude oil to produce naph-
tha, diesel and kerosene via the Fischer(cid:1)Tropsch process (e.g.
[12])

P(cid:3) conversion of syngas into methanol, which may be further
refined into dimethyl ether (a potential transport fuel), olefins
and acetic acid

P(cid:3) conversion of syngas into hydrogen to produce ammonia and

urea or for use in fuel cells (e.g. [13(cid:1)15])

P(cid:3) conversion of syngas into synthetic natural gas, via the metha-

nation reaction

PFig. 2 shows a schematic of the important products that can be
made with UCG. Carbon dioxide may be separated from the syngas
and used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or sequestered in geologi-
cal formations in so-called carbon capture and storage (CCS) proj-
ects.

PThe focus of this paper, which is Part I of a two-part series, is on
describing the main methods of undertaking underground coal gasi-
fication, summarising the results of field demonstrations, analysing
the factors which affect the process performance and reviewing the
economic and environmental considerations of developing projects.
In Part II of the series, a detailed examination of the fundamental
phenomena in various zones of the process is performed, including
at the cavity sidewall, in the permeable bed of ash and char, in the
void spaces and in the near- and far-fields surrounding the active
gasification zones.

2. Underground coal gasification methods

PThe main methods for underground coal gasification are:

P(cid:3) chamber method
P(cid:3) stream method
P(cid:3) linked vertical wells method
P(cid:3) controlled retracting injecting point method
P(cid:3) steeply dipping beds method

PThe dependent variables in underground coal gasification are
shown in Table 1. Like mining and oil and gas extraction, site selec-
tion determines most of the important independent variables which
determine the technical and economic performance.

PA schematic of several of the methods is shown in Fig. 3. Several
other methods, such as the blind-borehole method, a small-bore
method and the long tunnel system of gasifying manually-mined
channels have also been trialled [17(cid:1)20]. Table 2 provides a sum-
mary of significant underground coal gasification projects world-
wide since the 1930s.

2.1. Early efforts in former Soviet Union

PEfforts to develop UCG methods started in the 1930s in the for-
mer Soviet Union. Initial experiments were conducted on a range of
coals in three coal basins: the Moscow, Donetsk and Kuznetsk with
some of the early attempts aimed at gasifing pillars left behind from

Proom and pillar underground coal mining using the chamber method
[35]. Fig. 4 shows the configuration of the first UCG experiment con-
ducted at the Krutova mine in the Moscow basin in 1933 [36,37]. A
panel of 10 £ 10 m coal was separated from the seam using brick
walls, with air injected on one side and produced gas extracted from
the other side. In these early UCG experiments the flame front prop-
agations were found to be difficult to control due to the heteroge-
seams and were judged to be

unsatisfactory.

the coal

PIn 1933 a group of engineers from the Donetsk Institute of Coal
Chemistry (DUKhI) suggested gasifying coal in a channel [35]. The
method involved mining two shafts to the coal seam and mining a
drift shaft between them. Oxidant would be injected via boreholes
in one shaft and syngas extracted from boreholes in the second.
They applied this technique, which became known as the stream
method, in a dipping coal seam in the Donetsk basin [35]. Fig. 5
shows a schematic of the stream method.

PIn the 1940s the Soviets began to experiment with using a pat-
tern of boreholes drilled into the coal seams [21,35,38,39]. The early
shaftless methods used rectangular and circular arrays of boreholes
spaced very close together (on the order of several metres). The in
situ combustion process was started by dropping hot charcoals
down one set of wells, while using another set of wells to inject air
and a third set of wells to recover the produced gases. These meth-
ods were generally called “percolation” methods. Due to the low nat-
ural permeability of the coal seams, the Soviets struggled to achieve
satisfactory performance, and the costs were prohibitively high due
to the need for boreholes spaced extremely close together.

2.2. Linked vertical wells method

PThe linked vertical wells (LVW) technique evolved over a period
of several decades as the Soviets experimented with a number of so-

Pcalled “linking” methods, to increase the permeability of the coal
seams between boreholes, including reverse combustion, electric
resistive heating, hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling
[35,40,41]. Reverse combustion linking was found to be a reliable
method, in relatively shallow and relatively low rank coals (lignite,
sub-bituminous coal) and could be operated with well centres
between 20 m and 50 m apart. Fig. 6 shows a typical example of the
well array and sequence of gasification for shaftless UCG methods
developed for flat lying coal seams. This method was used at the
Shatskaya UCG station in the Moscow basin, producing several hun-
dred million m3 of syngas each year from a 2 to 4 m thick lignite at
shallow depth [22]. Reverse combustion linking remains a major
limiting factor for the LVW concept as it requires relatively perme-
able coal seams, short distances between wells and is slow to com-
plete a link, with typical linking speeds of between 1 and 4 m/day
[42].

2.3. Steeply dipping coal seam method

PMany coal seams dip at significant angles, and for these the
Soviets developed an alternate technique. The scheme involved
using the shaft mined to access one seam to provide access to an
overlying seam and the mining of a firing drift. Injection boreholes,
typically inclined, were drilled from the surface and production
boreholes were drilled into the underlying seam to act as production
wells [38]. The gasification of a steeply dipping coal seam was per-
formed at the Rawlins site in the United States of America
[35,43,44]. Coal char is converted at the bottom of the gasifier and
the produced gases move upwards causing moisture and volatile
matter in the coal to be released, which in turn, results in the coal
falling into the gasification region below as seen in Fig. 3. Gas quality
from steeply dipping coal seams is very good [24] (cid:1) probably
because of the high surface area for reaction (cid:1) however, application
of this technique is limited by the availability of steeply dipping coal
seams in suitable locations. Since ash, slag and rock rubble has the
propensity to create a zone of low permeability above the injection
well, multiple injection wells are needed to gasify a steeply dipping
coal seam [38].

2.4. Controlled retracting injection point method

PThe CRIP technique uses directional drilling to locate an injection
well, low and horizontal in the seam, as seen in Fig. 7 [45]. By having
a retractable igniter/injector, the injection location can be moved by
the operators at the surface, allowing a staged access of the coal
seam. In the first stage, the injection point is located close to the pro-
duction well. In the second and subsequent stages the injection
point is retracted away from the production well to form a new gasi-
fication cavity in fresh coal. The technique was first implemented at
scale in the Partial Seam CRIP test at Centralia [46]. An advantage of

Fig. 3. Schematic of the several techniques used for conducting underground coal
gasification: (a) linked vertical wells, (b) controlled retracting injection point (CRIP),
and (c) steeply dipping coal seams.

Pthe CRIP technique is that injection location remained low in the
seam, injection well damage from subsidence was minimized and
large amounts of coal could be gasified with a single injection/pro-
duction well pair. Various embodiments have been reported (e.g.
[47]) and well configurations include a linear CRIP (L-CRIP), a knife-
edge CRIP (K-CRIP) and a parallel CRIP (P-CRIP). The US R&D pro-
gramme culminated with the Rocky Mountain I demonstration proj-
ect in Hanna, Wyoming, in which 11,000 tons of coal were gasified
in 100 days using a knife-edge CRIP gasifier [26].

2.5. Long tunnel method

PThe long tunnel method has been developed at the Chinese Uni-
versity for Mining and Technology (CUMT) and is a mixture of a shaft
and shaftless UCG method [29,49,50]. The process is called the “long
tunnel, large section, two stage” UCG method by the Chinese [29]. It
involves boreholes, an airflow tunnel and a gasification tunnel as
shown in Fig. 8. The size of each gasifier is approximately

P200 m £ 200 m [51]. In the first stage of operation, air is injected into
the gasifier, to support combustion, heating the face of the coal
seam to over 1000 °C. In the second stage, steam is injected and
reacts with the coal at high temperature to form carbon monox-
ide and hydrogen, with the H2 concentration reaching about
50 vol% in the produced syngas [52]. The main objective of the
method is to access additional coal resources from existing mine

Pshafts and it has the advantage of producing a high quality syn-
gas when using air as the oxidant [53]. Production capacities for
each gasifier are reported to be on the order of 1500 Nm3/h of
syngas [29]. Since the 1990s over 15 long tunnel gasifiers have
been constructed and operated [51].

PWashington in the Tono basin [54]. The coal at this location was sub-
bituminous with considerable ash in the form of stringers and each
experiment lasted between 3 and 7 days and affected between 20
and 50 m3 of coal. Steam/oxygen ratios of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 along
with air were used as the oxidant. Table 3 provides a summary of
the operating conditions and performance of the experiments.

PFig. 9 shows pictures of the excavated cavities from the tests.
Inspections showed an ellipsoid profile in plan view with cavity
cross-sections having an oval shape, with vertical to horizontal
aspect ratios of between 1:1 and 2:1 [55]. The cavities were found to
contain a permeable pile of dried coal, char, ash and in most cases
roof rock material. In no case was there a completely open channel
through the coal seam. Grens and Thorsness report that in many cir-
cumstances the cavity is filled with char rubble, fused and rubblized
roof rock, with a void space at the top and an ash layer on the cavity
floor [56].

P3.1.2. Partial Seam CRIP

PFollowing on from the large block experiments, the LLNL devel-
oped a larger experiment at the WIDCO coal mine to field test the
controlled retracting injection point concept, called the Partial Seam
CRIP trial. The project utilized the high wall geometry of the Cen-
tralia open pit mine to gasify coal over a thirty day period in 1983
[58,59]. The project included a horizontal injection well, a slant pro-
duction well (PRD-1) and a vertical production well (PRD-2). A
30 day operations period resulted in 2000 tons of coal being con-
verted into syngas using mostly an oxidant of oxygen and steam.
Fig. 10 shows a plan view of the 14 slices through the affected coal
that were made during the post-burn excavation activities.

PThe volume of coal affected was calculated from excavations to
be 1150 m3, while material balance estimates were 1388 m3 with a
char accumulation ratio of 0.3 [46]. Fig. 11 shows the schematic of a
typical slice through the cavity in the vicinity of the injection point
location. It can be seen that the cavity grew upwards consuming
coal to the roof of the seam and then expanded into the overburden.
Cavity shapes exhibited an hourglass shape with pinching around
the midpoint of the coal seam height. Ash accumulated around the
injection point, with unconverted char present at the lateral extrem-
ities of the cavity. Spalled and collapsed overburden materials were
present above the ash and char and were distinguished by various
colours during the excavations. According to Cena et al., the ash and
char appeared highly permeable, while the rock rubble was less

3. Summary of field demonstrations

PObservations of performance of UCG, excavations and post-burn
coring of the cavities are important to develop fundamental insights
into the gasification phenomena, to develop conceptual models of
the process, and finally, to formulate mathematical models by which
the process can be described quantitatively. In this section, pertinent
observations from projects conducted in the USA, Europe, Australia
and Canada are summarized.

3.1. American era experience

PThe excavations and post-burn coring activities of UCG projects
conducted as part of the American program in the 1980s still provide
the most detailed and illustrative insights into how coal gasification
proceeds underground.

P3.1.1. Large block experiments

PA series of five experiments (LBK-1 to LBK-5) were conducted by
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1981/82 in
an exposed coal face in the WIDCO coal mine near Centralia,

Ppermeable, having large areas where the material had been fused
together at high temperatures [46].

PThe outflow channel consisted of packed char rubble with aver-
age particle size of 1
2 cm or less. A V-shape channel formed from
shrinkage and slumping of the heated coal leading to the formation
of a void space. The hot syngas dries coal to the sides and above the
void space, while the sagging and slumping dried coal insulates the
bottom [46]. As more coal is dried and falls down, the gas flow
migrates upwards leading to the creation of V-shaped channel.

P3.1.3. Rocky Mountain I

PThe Rocky Mountain I project was conducted in south western
Wyoming near the town of Hanna and was designed to demonstrate
the technologies of CRIP and ELW (Extended Linked Well) alongside
each other in the same coal seam at a commercial production scale
[48,60]. The coal was sub-bituminous, at a depth of 110 m with a
thickness of approximately 7.6 m.

PThe CRIP module ran from November 1987 to February 1988
operating for 93 days and converting 11,023 tons of coal [48]. The
CRIP module included a horizontally drilled injection and production
well and a vertical well used only for linking. The ELW module
included a horizontally drilled production well and two vertical
injection wells.

PDue to the depth of the Rocky Mountain I project, the gasification
cavities could not be excavated. Instead an 18 well post-burn coring

Pprogram was developed to delineate the areal extent of the cavities,
identify the extent of roof collapse, obtain samples of cavity materi-
als and to characterise the area near the ignition and CRIP locations
[61]. Fig. 12 shows the interpretation of a section through the cavity
in the vicinity of the initial ignition. An ash and slag layer is found on
the bottom of the cavities, with unconverted char thought to exist
on the lateral regions of the cavity. Unconverted coal remains in
place below the level of the wells and remains unaffected due to the
insulative properties of the ash and slag. In the bulk of the affected
zone, rubblized rock material is found to account for between about
25 and 50% of the cavity height. Void spaces are found, but are rela-
tively small and not uniform across the cavity cross section. Altered
over-burden roof material is found and penetrates up to 50% of the
seam height into the overlying rock layer [61].

3.2. Thulin, Belgium

PIn the 1980s a first UCG experiment at great depth was carried
out within the framework of the Belgo(cid:1)German project on under-
ground coal gasification [62,63]. The coal at this location was a low
volatile semi-anthracite, with a thickness of 4 (cid:1) 6 m at a depth of
860 m [64]. Two vertical wells (TH1 and TH2) were drilled into the
coal seam separated by 35 m. The plan was to link the wells by
reverse combustion, however after two years of unsuccessful

PThree post-burn wells (PB1, PB2, PB3) were drilled to examine
the affected materials from the test. Analysis of the samples col-
lected from the post burn drilling revealed that temperatures at least
900 °C and possibly up to 1100 °C existed in the vicinity of PB2, while
lower temperatures not exceeding 450 °C were observed in well PB1
[62]. Post-burn drilling showed affected and rubblized overburden
material along with affected coal and samples of ash and slag. Minor
void spaces were also identified, but due to the high pressure, the
gasification process is thought to have operated mostly in the

Pattempts it was decided to link the wells using short radius drilling
[62].

PGasification operations started on 2nd October 1986 and ended
on 25th May 1987. The process gradually transitioned to a filtration
gasification process under high pressure (20(cid:1)30 MPa) through the
coal seam, leading to the generation of medium BTU gas with a high
methane content [62]. During the project’s duration three oxidants
were tested: air, oxygen enriched air and a mixture of oxygen and
foamy water. Flow modelling during the gasification operations
showed that the flow behaviour was relatively dispersive [64].

Pcombined Macalister A and B seams within the Juandah Coal Meas-
ures, located circa 130 m below the surface and with an average of 6
and 4 m in thickness, respectively. The overburden (Springbok For-
mation Sandstones) comprises a sequence of medium grey inter-
bedded carbonate cemented lithic-feldspathic siltstones and fine
sandstones with minor carbonaceous mudstone, mudstone and coal
stringers. Between the surface and the bottom of the Macalister coal
seams, there are no high yielding aquifers. The coal quality at the
site is sub-bituminous with a calorific value between 15 to 21 MJ/kg,
with an average of 19 MJ/kg.

PTable 4 provides a summary of the five gasifiers operated at Chin-
chilla. Gasifier 1 operated from 1999 to 2002 and has been described
in detail elsewhere [30,65(cid:1)67]. Gasifier 2 and 3 used variants of the
linked vertical well concept with varying degrees of success [12].
Gasifier 4 used a parallel CRIP design with uncased open hole hori-
zontals. Around 14,759 tons of coal were converted to syngas over
two years of operations, mostly using air as an oxidant [31]. Trials of
O2 enriched air (up to 40 mol%) and CO2/air gasification were also
undertaken [68].

PGasifier 5 was commissioned in October 2011 and consisted of a
modified Linear CRIP design with three vertical service wells, and
with directionally drilled injection and production wells, with the
main well heads spaced 900 m from each other [31,69]. The injection
and production horizontals intersected the service wells as seen in
Fig. 15, forming a drilled link from the injection side to the produc-
tion side. The production well was directionally drilled, mostly as a
precaution, so that coiled tubing tools could be run in the well to
remove any particulate or tarry matter that might build up after
ignition of the gasifier. The injection well used a proprietary 4 1/200
liner which had alternating sections of blank casing and casing sec-
tions with laser-cut apertures encased in a HDPE sheath [70]. The

3.3. Chinchilla, Australia

PThe Chinchilla site located approximately 350 km west of Bris-
bane, Australia was the site of five demonstration gasifiers from
1999 to 2013 conducted in a sub-bituminous coal seam up to 10 m
thick. At its peak, the Chinchilla Demonstration Facility consisted of
UCG facilities, a 5 to 10 bpd GTL plant, a waste water treatment
plant, a tank farm, chemical laboratory and supporting infrastruc-
ture, see Fig. 14 [31]. The coal seam targeted for UCG was the

Fig. 15. Schematic of the well layout used in Gasifier 5 at Chinchilla, Australia (from Perkins et al. [31]).

Pproduction well liner was 700 and included laser-cut apertures along
the horizontal section to increase the collection surface area for the
produced syngases. A total of 20 thermocouples were installed on
the liner of the injection well and 12 thermocouples were installed
on the liner of the production well and provided real-time tempera-
ture measurement over the life of wells’ operation. The length of the
in-seam horizontal was limited to 360 m by the surface layout of the
site. The initial ignition of Gasifier 5 was performed using a down-
hole electrical heater in Service Well 2. Subsequently, the location of
the active gasification zone was moved using a natural gas/air
burner deployed on coiled tubing or through operational changes to
the air injection rate. A water quench system was installed into Ser-
vice Well 1 to control the downhole temperature at the heel of the
production well to below 350 °C.

PGasifier 5 operated continuously from October 2011 till Novem-
ber 2013, converting more than 19,000 tons of coal into syngas [31].
The average coal conversion rate over 24 months was circa 27 tpd,
while the peak conversion rate of circa 45 tpd was achieved using
oxygen blown gasification (see Table 10 for performance data). Over
the gasifier’s life the active gasification zone was retracted more
than 300 m from the ignition point close to Service Well 2, to
» 30 m in front of the heel of the injection well.

PFor oxygen blown gasification, liquid oxygen was supplied by
truck and stored at site and vaporized at surface. Oxygen and water
injection was achieved by using a concentric coiled tubing consisting
of 3.500 outer diameter tubing, a 200 stainless steel coil to convey the
pure oxygen and a thermocouple. The oxygen and water were mixed
downhole in a nozzle designed to handle temperatures of over
1000 °C and sprayed into the active gasification zone. Fig. 16 shows
a picture of the oxygen-water nozzle being tested at surface in the
presence of natural gas burners used to simulate the high tempera-
tures present downhole near oxidant injection zone. The nozzle also
included check-valves to prevent syngas from entering into the
coiled tubing.

PFor gasification operations on air, the oxidant was injected into
the main injection wellbore and the dry syngas heating value was 4
to 5 MJ/Nm3 with an oxygen utilization of » 950 MJ/kmol. The

Poxygen utilization (MJ/kmol) is a key measure of performance for
UCG:

O2 utilization 1⁄4

Energy in syngas ðMJ=sÞ
Injected oxygen rate ðkmol=sÞ

ð1Þ

PFor UCG it is a more reliable indicator than the cold gas efficiency,
which relies on a calculation of the coal converted to syngas, which
can not be measured directly. On oxygen blown gasification the syn-
gas heating value was in the range 10 to 11 MJ/Nm3 and the oxygen
utilization was around 1200 MJ/kmol.

3.4. Bloodwood Creek, Australia

PThe Bloodwood Creek site located near Kogan west of Brisbane,
Australia was the site of two UCG gasifiers operated by Carbon
Energy [33,71]. The UCG projects were conducted in the Macalister
seam of the Walloon coal measures (cid:1) the same one targeted at the
nearby Chinchilla site. At the Bloodwood Creek location the coal was
deeper at » 200 m below the surface with a thickness of up to 13 m
[72].

ther studies concluded that safe levels of benzene would exist within
27 m of the cavity and that the best long term remediation method is

3.5. Swan Hills, Canada

PBetween 2009 and 2011 Swan Hills Synfuels LP undertook a dem-
onstration project of UCG in Alberta, Canada [34]. The target was the
Mannville formation with a coal seam located » 1450 m below
ground level, a reservoir pressure exceeding 100 bar, a permeability
less than 1 md, an average thickness of 4.5 m and a lower calorific
value of » 29 MJ/kg. Fig. 19 shows a schematic of the well layout
and surface facilities of the Swan Hills UCG project.

PLiquid oxygen and nitrogen were vaporized and pumped through
a coiled tubing unit into the injection well. The Swan Hills project
used the L-CRIP configuration with a directionally drilled injection
well of 4 1/200 diameter and a horizontal section of » 1600 m. A
coiled tubing unit (see Fig. 20) using a concentric coil with 2 3/800
outer coil, an instrument string and a 1/200 ignition tubing was used
to deliver oxygen and ignition fluids into the injection well, with
water delivered via the annulus between the coiled tubing and cas-
ing. The production well was drilled vertically and incorporated a
water quench to control the bottom hole temperature.

PSuccessful ignition with a pyrophoric fluid and operations using
water and oxygen injection at mass ratios of between 2:1 and 3:1
were conducted at the site [34]. While the design coal conversion
rate was 118 tpd, it is unlikely this was achieved, due to the presence
of a restricted flow path between the toe of the injection well and
the production well [34]. Swan Hills experimented with hydraulic
pumping, water jet micro-drilling, forward combustion and direct

Fig. 17. Aerial view of the Bloodwood Creek UCG site in Australia in 2010 showing
location of Panel 1 (from Mallett [32]). Panel 2 was later drilled parallel to Panel 1 in
2011.

PCarbon Energy used a P-CRIP gasifier design, which was ignited
via a vertical well positioned at the apex of the two horizontals each
having 500 m of in-seam length and which were spaced 30 m apart
[32,72]. Panel 1 was started up in October 2008 and was operated
mostly on air with a short period of steam/oxygen gasification. Panel
2 operated from March 2011 to October 2012, converting more than
10,000 tons of coal
into syngas. Carbon Energy also built and
commissioned a 5 MWe gas engine power plant which used the syn-
gas from UCG to generate up to 1.5 MWe of electricity and export
this into the local grid. Fig. 17 shows an aerial view of the Bloodwood
Creek site.

PFig. 18 shows the injection and production flow rates and the
higher heating value of the produced syngas from a period of opera-
tion of Panel 2. While the injection flow is stable, it is observed that
periodically the syngas flow rate and quality will drop steeply, due
to poor gasification efficiency (poor contact of reactants with coal,
combustion of produced syngas, excess heat losses). This drop in
performance is used to indicate when its time to move the oxidant
injection zone to a new location. Fig. 18 shows that after a CRIP
manoeuvre, the syngas flowrate and quality improves back to its
baseline value. Thus, a field of UCG gasifiers is able to provide a con-
sistent production flow and quality of syngas to a downstream user.
PThe main environmental concern of UCG is contamination of
local groundwaters by pyrolysis products formed during the gasifi-
cation process. Carbon Energy has published several reports of the
environmental performance of the Bloodwood Creek UCG projects
during and after operations [72,73]. Table 5 shows estimates of the

PWhile Swan Hills Synfuels applied to redrill the injection and pro-
duction wells after the incident, these applications do not appear to
have been successful [75]. The Swan Hills project highlights the chal-
lenges of conducting UCG at high pressures. The combination of high
temperatures, pure oxygen, water and corrosive and flammable
gases poses challenges for materials selection and for the design of
safety systems. Applying the lessons learnt from this project and the
operating experience from Gasifier 5 on oxygen/water mixtures will
be critical for future UCG projects at high pressures, where an oxy-
gen/steam mixture can not be used.

3.6. “Barbara” and Wieczorek, Poland

PThe Central Mining Institute in Poland has been actively
researching and developing UCG methods for application in aban-
doned and working underground coal mines as part of the HUGE
(Hydrogen-orientated Underground Gasification for Europe) and
HUGE 2 research projects (e.g. [76(cid:1)79]). A 6 day UCG pilot test was
undertaken during August 2013 in the “Barbara” coal mine in South-
ern Poland [79]. The target coal was located in coal seam 310 at a
depth of 30 m and the gasifier was operated with oxygen blown gas-
ification at a pressure of » 1 bar. A total of 5.3 tons of coal was con-
verted with an overall cold gas efficiency of 70% [79]. The average
gas composition and gas heating value for the first 4 days of the
experiment are shown in Table 7.

PIn 2015, a larger and longer duration UCG pilot was undertaken at
the Wieczorek hard coal mine in Poland located in the central part of
the Upper Silesian Coal Basin [28]. The target coal, was the no. 501
coal seam, which has lower calorific value of 25.5 MJ/kg, a thickness
of 5.5 m and is located at a depth of 464 m below ground level at the
gasification site.
Injection and production piping of diameters
200 mm and 300 mm, respectively, was run to and from the UCG
gasifier via the existing mine shafts. The research program for the
gasification test, included operation on air + oxygen (Phase I), air
(Phase II), air + carbon dioxide (Phase III), air (Phase IV) and air +
nitrogen (Phase V) [28]. The gas composition versus time for these
five phases is shown in Fig. 21.

PDuring the 60 day operations period, a total of 230 tons of coal
was gasified yielding an average syngas heating value (LHV) of
3.4 MJ/Nm3. The average coal consumption rate was » 4.3 tpd, the
average gas production rate was 786 Nm3/h, and the maximum gas
production rate reached 2400 Nm3/h [28].

PThe UCG pilot tests in coal mines show that the coal gasification
can be undertaken in this manner, however the production rates
demonstrated to date are moderate and the gas quality is only suit-
able for combustion in furnaces. There is a lot of further work
required to demonstrate a technically feasible operation at a com-
mercially viable scale.

3.7. General representation of the UCG process

PThe excavations and post-burn drilling of both small scale and
large scale and both low pressure and high pressure UCG projects,
complemented by laboratory experiments enable the development
of a general conceptual view of how coal is affected and converted
into syngas during the in situ gasification process. Figs. 22(cid:1)25

Pintercept drilling to improve the connection between the injection
and production wells, with limited success [34]. Table 6 provides the
forecast syngas compositions from the Swan Hills demonstration.
Due to the high pressures, the syngas contains high proportions of
methane and carbon dioxide. Between February and April 2011 the
temperature at the oxygen injection nozzle installed at the end of
the coiled tubing ranged from 200 to 350 °C, which is comparable to
that measured during oxygen blown operation in Chinchilla, Gasifier
5 [34]. The major advantages of undertaking UCG at depth, including
isolation from shallow water aquifers and the generation of high
quality syngas were achieved.

PHowever, on October 10th 2011, a complex sequence of events
led to a blowout of the injection well and an explosion and fire in
the surface facilities [74]. The root cause analysis identified a long
list of factors that contributed to the incident. A major factor was
that the coiled tubing was corroded by an oxygen and water mixture
at high pressure, which caused syngas and oxygen to mix, leading to
an ignition event in the vertical section of the injection well which
continued until it reached the surface, resulting in the blowout and
fire. The mixing and ignition of oxygen and syngas in the injection
well and uncontrolled burn-back to surface should have been pre-
vented. The controls which could have mitigated the ignition and
burn-back include: better operating procedures, automatic oxygen
shut-off and water quench on the injection well, use of check-valves
on the oxygen supply coil and the installation of a fire-break mate-
rial at the heel of the injection well (see detailed list prepared by
Alberta Energy Regulator [74]). These control systems were imple-
mented in the Gasifier 5 project at Chinchilla, and successfully pre-
vented failure and uncontrolled burn-back of the oxygen filled
coiled tubing when operating on pure oxygen.

Poperated at a pressure lower than the surrounding pressure (hydro-
static) and this results in water and gas to flow towards the produc-
tion well.

PFig. 24 shows a schematic of the coal wall where it interfaces
with the hot cavity. From the void space, hot turbulent gas radiates
heat towards the surface of the wall, leading to the subsequent dry-
ing, pyrolysis and gasification of the coal. Steam, volatiles and syngas
from the gasification process migrate into the void space. Ash may
build up on the surface as the carbon is consumed. Invariably, cracks
develop in the weakened and pyrolyzed coal, leading to small pieces
of coal breaking off from the wall and spalling into the cavity. The
length scale over which the coal is converted is only a few tens of
centimetres depending upon the conditions [81,82].

PIn a commercial project multiple UCG gasifiers will be operated
simultaneously to produce the syngas required for the downstream
process. Fig. 25 shows a schematic of how multiple Linear CRIP gasif-
iers operating in parallel could be drilled and operated.

PFrom this general picture, we can identify several regions within
the UCG process: i) the void space formed above the permeable bed
of ash and char and below the roof, ii) the permeable bed of ash and
char formed due to spalling, iii) the sidewall and roof boundaries
where coal is heated, pyrolyzes, reacts and spalls, iv) a near field
region around the gasification cavity where thermal, mechanical
and chemical changes occur due to the formation of the cavity itself
and v) the far field region which is mostly affected by the gasifier in
terms of changes in the pressure and concentration of components
from their natural values. Table 8 provides a summary of these zones
and the relevant processes and physics that dominate in each of
them.

4. Factors affecting process performance

PAttempts have been made to gasify a wide range of coal types
in different coal seam conditions using the techniques discussed in
Section 2. Table 2 provides a summary of the underground coal gasif-
iers that have been operated in the past. Table 9 shows a set of key
performance indicators (KPIs) for UCG. Fundamentally, it is desirable
to have low cost, high efficiency, high resource recovery and reliable
operations with low environmental impacts! In practice there are
many decisions and trade-offs to be made in order to achieve a

Fig. 21. Gas compositions versus time for the Wieczorek UCG pilot project (from
Mocek et al. [28]).

Pprovide depictions of this general picture using the Linear CRIP con-
figuration, from the scale of a coal block up to the scale of multiple
gasifiers. The observations are consistent with descriptions of the
process as reported in the former Soviet Union (e.g. [38,80]), the
demonstration projects in America and Europe (e.g. [27,62]) and
recent demonstrations in Australia, Canada and Poland. Fig. 22
shows a general representation of the UCG process from a sideview
perspective. As the coal is converted, ash builds up above the hori-
zontal well. Injected oxidant disperses through the bed, gasifying
the char within the bed and generating high temperatures. Above
the bed, combustion and gasification reactions occur in the void
space, producing a hot radiant turbulent gas. Heat is transferred to
the walls of the cavity causing wall recession by chemical reaction
and thermo-chemical failure (spalling) of coal and overburden rock
as shown in the cross-sectional view provided in Fig. 23. Spalled
char and ash fall onto the top of the ash bed. As the hot gases move
towards the production well they cool down due to the endothermic
gasification reactions, the heat required to dry and pyrolyze coal and
from heat losses to the over- and under-burden formations. Towards
the production well, pyrolyzed coal leads to a build up of char form-
ing a permeable bed. In the coal seam surrounding the growing cav-
ity, water and gases flow through the porous media of the coal
driven by the local pressure gradient. Typically the gasifier is

Pconditions and does not extract sensible energy from the reaction
zone. These results are typical of UCG projects conducted in sub-
bituminous coal seams at relatively low pressure.

PIn the USA demonstration projects conducted in the 1980s,
steam/oxygen ratios of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 were trialled. Table 11 shows
the effect of changes in the steam/oxygen ratio of the oxidant on the
resulting product gas composition. Increases in the steam/oxygen
ratio lead to significant drops in the CO content of the syngas, and
smaller rises in the H2 and CO2 content [54]. Hill and Thorsness also
report that changes in the system were most pronounced at low oxi-
dant injection rates [54]. In the Rocky Mountain I demonstration a
steam/oxygen ratio of 2:1 was used. Subsequent analysis showed
that the optimum steam/oxygen ratio would have been 1.3:1. [83].

PIn the long tunnel method, a two-stage gasification technique is
utilized. In the first stage air is used to heat up the coal face and then
in the second stage steam is injected to produce a high quality syn-
gas. During the steam gasification stage, the gas quality is typically
11(cid:1)12 MJ/m3 and the gas composition is reported to be: H2
47(cid:1)58 vol%, CO 8(cid:1)14 vol%, CO2 19(cid:1)23 vol%, CH4 9(cid:1)12 vol% and N2
5(cid:1)9 vol% [29]. The influence of the oxygen content in air on the
product syngas quality from field tests of the long tunnel method is
shown in Fig. 26. The use of high O2-enrichment levels in air, leads
to higher CO, H2 and CH4 content in the product gas and lower N2
content, causing the overall heating value of the syngas to increase.

PThe gas from UCG typically has a methane content similar to
moving bed gasification due to the low exit temperatures which is
insufficient to completely crack the volatiles from pyrolysis [84]. In
high pressure operations, the formation of methane via the reaction
of H2 with char is favoured. Yields of hydrocarbon liquids (tars) from
UCG are typically lower than in moving bed gasifiers, because some
of them are cracked in the high temperature zones and others
remain trapped in the underground cavity.

PThe concentration of CO in the UCG product gas is lower than in
entrained flow systems due to the lower temperatures, and the con-
centration of CO2 is correspondingly higher. However, in a well
designed and operated underground gasifier, it is expected that the
greater production of methane can offset the lower CO content, thus
making the overall product gas heating value comparable to that
obtainable from surface gasification [48].

4.2. Effect of coal properties

PCoal properties have a substantial effect on the operation and
performance of UCG. Historically, demonstrations have mostly been
conducted in low rank coals which are reactive and which spall

Pviable process. While performance should be comprehensively
judged by considering efficiency, economic and environmental
aspects, this section looks at a more limited set of factors, including
the effect of oxidant, coal properties, coal seam depth, coal seam
thickness, process scale, gasifier design and site conditions.

4.1. Effect of oxidant

PThe injected oxidant is usually either air, enriched air, or a mix-
ture of steam/oxygen or water/oxygen. The rate of gas production
and its composition varies widely depending upon the oxidant used,
operating conditions such as gas injection rate and site conditions,
including type of coal, and the behaviour of the surrounding strata
and hydro-geological conditions. When air is used, the product gas
has a lower heating value of 3(cid:1)6 MJ/m3 (STP), and the nitrogen con-
tent of the gas is 40(cid:1)50 vol%. When a steam/oxygen mixture is used
as the oxidant, the product gas heating value can reach 11 MJ/m3 or
more. Table 10 shows the performance of Gasifier 5 at the Chinchilla
site in Australia for both air blown and oxygen blown operations.
Under air blown conditions the gas heating value was typically
around 5 MJ/Nm3 while under oxygen blown conditions (with water
injection) the gas heating value was around 10 MJ/Nm3 [31]. It can
be seen that the oxygen utilization is improved under oxygen blown
conditions, as nitrogen does not need to be heated up to process

Pupon heating, which help the conversion of coal into gas [85]. Some
of the most successful UCG demonstrations such as Rocky Mountain
I, Bloodwood Creek Panel 2 and Chinchilla Gasifier 5 have been
undertaken in sub-bituminous coals with relatively high volatile
fractions, moderate moisture contents and moderate ash contents
[26,31,33].

PLi et al. have conducted a controlled set of experiments in large
coal blocks to establish the influence of coal rank on the likely per-
formance of UCG [29]. Table 12 shows the produced gas composi-
tions, syngas heating value and gas production rate from three types
of coal. It can be seen that sub-bituminous coals give high methane
content, moderate to high heating value and a high production rate
of gas per unit of coal. Lignites produce a syngas with lower heating
value and produce less gas per ton of coal. In the laboratory experi-
ments, bituminous coals produce a syngas lower heating value simi-
lar to that of sub-bituminous coals with slightly higher gas
production per ton of coal.

PThe rank of the coal, its propensity to spall when heated and the
behaviour of mineral matter upon heating are key factors in deter-
mining the performance of large scale UCG. Low rank coals generally
shrink and spall upon heating, enabling renewal of the sidewall and

Proof surfaces and the establishment of a permeable bed of coal and
ash through which the injected oxidant can readily flow and pene-
trate to the surface in order to gasify the remaining fixed carbon
[86]. The excavations of UCG projects summarized in Section 3 were
all performed with low rank coals. High rank coals are less reactive
and have a tendency to swell upon heating, potentially causing prob-
lems with diffusion of volatiles from within the pore structure to
reach the surface of the coal. In addition, the spalling behaviour of
high rank coals is not well understood.

PThe behaviour of the mineral matter during gasification is impor-
tant. If an ash layer builds up on the coal, then this will significantly
impede the diffusion of oxygen, steam and carbon dioxide to the car-
bon, becoming a rate limiting step in the conversion of the coal into
syngas [82]. Similarly, if the mineral matter has a propensity to slag,
it may also significantly impede the gasification process.

PField demonstrations of the UCG process in high rank coals have
highlighted a number of challenges. The Pricetown project was the
first attempt to gasify bituminous Eastern coals of the United States
[87]. A poor link resulting from reverse combustion linking and
swelling of the high rank coal led to operational problems and only
17 days of forward gasification [24,87,88].

PThe Thulin UCG project conducted in the mid-1980s envisaged
creating a permeable link between two vertical wells in a deep
anthracite [62]. However, all attempts to link the wells failed and
short radius drilling was used to evenutally connect the injection
and production wells. The anthracite, being a high rank coal, was not
very reactive as evidenced from field data showing the presence of
oxygen in the product gases [63]. Thus, satisfactory gasification con-
ditions could not be established and less than 300 tons of coal were
converted to syngas.

PThe Pricetown and Thulin trials highlight that when applying
UCG in high rank coals, a good flow path between the injection and
production wells must be established and the area available for reac-
tion maximized. The low moisture and volatile content of anthracite
and bituminous coals, together with low permeability, mean that
there are few reactants (steam, CO2, volatiles) for gasification that
can be supplied from within the coal itself. Thus, oxygen blown gasi-
fication together with the injection of steam or water should be used
under these conditions to ensure high enough reaction temperatures
and a sufficient supply of reactants for the steam gasification reac-
tion.

PHigh rank coals, generally have lower volatile contents than low
rank coals, and together with the low reactivity are therefore harder
to ignite. High sulphur levels, high chlorine levels and other contam-
inants have significant implications for the design of the surface
facilities, raw gas treatment and syngas clean up. The presence of
CO2 and water at high temperature and pressure is potentially very
corrosive. The presence of minor species such as sulphur and chlo-
rine can significantly exacerbate the situation. The selection of mate-
rials for production tubings and surface piping are impacted by the
syngas composition, temperature and pressure. In general, high sul-
phur, chlorine and other contaminants lead to higher costs for han-
dling and treating the produced syngas.

4.3. Effect of coal seam depth

4.4. Effect of coal seam thickness

PThere are many site factors which influence the UCG process,
and coal seam depth is a significant one. The operating pressure
is determined by coal seam depth. As a rule of thumb, the oper-
ating pressure increases by » 1 MPa ( » 10 bar) for every 100 m
of depth.

PFig. 27 shows prior UCG projects plotted against mean coal seam
depth and mean coal seam thickness. The cutoffs shown delineating
thin/thick and shallow/deep coals have arbitrarily been set at 5 m
and 300 m, respectively. It can be seen that field demonstrations can
be grouped into two categories (cid:1) those conducted at shallow depth
( < 300 m) and those conducted in thin seams ( < 5 m). For example,
there are no trials which have been conducted in thick seams at
appreciable depth. Qualitatively it can be expected that at shallow
depths there is likely to be increased interaction between the cavity
and the surface and operating pressures will be low. As a rule of
thumb, UCG should be undertaken in coals deeper than 200 m to
ensure sufficient containment pressure from surrounding ground-
waters [72]. As the depth increases, operating pressure increase and
so do drilling costs.

PThe effect on performance with coal seam depth is shown in
Table 13 using the gas composition and heating value results
from four demonstration projects. As the pressure increases,
there is a general trend towards more CO2 and CH4 in the syngas
and lower amounts of CO and H2, which is consistent with ther-
modynamic calculations. In general, the (nitrogen free) heating
value of the syngas increases with pressure. It is expected that
the oxygen utilization should also increase in well designed and
operated projects due to higher cold gas efficiencies from lower
gas migration, lower water influx and lower heat loss from low
permeability deep coals.

Fig. 27. Summary of UCG projects in terms of mean seam thickness and mean seam
depth.

PApplication of UCG in thick coal seams ( > 5 m thick) has been
identified as being attractive in many parts of the world [91]. Thicker
seams offer a proportionately higher potential resource per unit of
projected surface area, which should translate into lower costs per
unit of coal gasified. On the other hand the gradient of hydrostatic
pressure is proportional to seam thickness, so water influx may be
more difficult to control in thick seams which are also generally
more permeable (cid:1) though this does not seem to have been borne
out in field demonstrations to date [24].

PFig. 28 shows the effect of coal seam thickness on the heating
value of the syngas from air blown gasification as measured by the
Soviets and reported by Gregg et al. [21]. The syngas heating value is
very low ( < 4 MJ/Nm3) when the coal seam is less than 3 m thick
and when the specific water inflow (ton-water/ton-coal-gasified) is
greater than 2 ton/ton. Thicker coal seams lead to less heat loss per
unit volume of coal affected and hence higher syngas heating values.

4.5. Effect of process scale

PLike other gasification methods, the economics of UCG are a func-
tion of the scale at which the process is undertaken. Here, the pro-
cess scale, refers to the syngas production capacity per injection-
production well pair. If the process scale is small, then many well
pairs will need to be drilled to deliver the desired syngas capacity
for the downstream process making the economics less attractive.
On the other hand, process wells have standard sizes and drilling
large diameter wells can be very expensive and may not be feasible.
PA succession of gasification tests at different process scales under
similar process conditions were performed in the USA by the LLNL,
starting with small scale laboratory experiments in drums, followed
by the Large Block Tests, and then by the Partial Seam CRIP test and
ending in the Rocky Mountain I field demonstration. Key process
characteristics are provided in Table 14. As can be seen the UCG
development was conducted across significant scales: about five
orders of magnitude in terms of coal affected and about three orders
of magnitude in terms of the rate of coal conversion. Across these
process scales, despite some differences in pressure and steam/oxy-
gen ratios, performance was relatively stable. The main observations
with regards to the process scale are:

P(cid:3) CO content decreased with scale
P(cid:3) CH4 content increased with scale
P(cid:3) H2 and CO2 content were reasonably stable with scale
P(cid:3) Oxygen utilization increased with scale

PThe CO, CH4 and oxygen utilization observations are thought to
be related to the residence time and also to the relative increase in
size of the pyrolysis zone in the outlet channel. Heat loss characteris-
tics of the different tests would also have played a role. Greater resi-
dence time, lower temperatures and heat loss, lead to reduced CO
content in the syngas. While a larger pyrolysis zone would lead to
higher CH4 content in the syngas and better oxygen utilization.

4.6. Effect of gasifier design

PFig. 30 shows schematics of the common UCG designs: Linked
Vertical Wells, Linear-CRIP and Parallel-CRIP. The K-CRIP design is
an approximation to the P-CRIP design, where straight injection and
production wells intersect at a point. In the Partial Seam CRIP and
the Rocky Mountain I field demonstrations a K-CRIP design was
implemented, largely due to limitations with directional drilling
technologies at the time. Generally,
in the K-CRIP and P-CRIP
designs, a vertical well is also drilled which is used as the ignition
well for the gasifier. The Gasifier 4 project at Chinchilla and Panel’s 1
and 2 at the Bloodwood Creek project used a P-CRIP design
[12,31,33]. In the L-CRIP design a horizontal injection well connects
to a vertical production well. The Swan Hills Synfuels project in
Alberta, Canada used a L-CRIP design [34]. In the case of Gasifier 5 at
Chinchilla, a modified L-CRIP design was used with a directionally
drilled production well [31]. In future, the P-CRIP and L-CRIP designs
are most likely to be used, along with variants involving the use of
multiple injection and/or production wells.

PThe main characteristics of the L-CRIP and P-CRIP designs are
summarized in Table 15. While there are many issues, the main ones
relate to the performance of each design over a full life cycle from
start up to shut down.

PThe L-CRIP design is economically attractive due to the require-
ment for only a single horizontal well, however care needs to be
taken in the design to avoid potential geomechnical impacts on the
production well and to manage high temperatures that exist at start
up. The design is suited to geological settings where the overburden
material is strong and has low propensity to undergo bulk collapse.
While the concept of using discrete ignitions was the basis of the L-
CRIP method, recent operational experience with Gasifier 5 at Chin-
chilla in Australia, shows that continuous retraction and gasification
can be undertaken under air blown conditions and also appears fea-
sible for oxygen blown gasification [31]. A remaining uncertainty is
how very long L-CRIP gasifiers ( > 500 m) will perform in terms of
the impacts of heat loss on gasification performance towards end of
life.

PThe P-CRIP design is attractive for geological settings which may
have a high propensity to collapse, as the goafing behind the

Fig. 28. Effect of coal seam thickness on the syngas heating value for various specific
water inflow rates using air blown gasification (data from Gregg et al. [21]).

PThe fact that even relatively small scale experiments were able to
provide a meaningful representation of the UCG process is very
encouraging, as such experiments are significantly cheaper to con-
duct than full scale UCG demonstrations. The results of laboratory
experiments should be combined with mathematical modeling to
enable greater scale up factors when commercializing the UCG pro-
cess in future.

PFig. 29 shows the effect of coal gasification rate on the syngas
heating value as measured by the Soviets and reported by Gregg
et al. [21]. Greater coal gasification rate leads to higher syngas heat-
ing value, due to the lower specific heat loss and specific water
inflow. Generally, coal gasification rates between 100 and 200 tpd
look attractive for delivering a reasonable quality syngas ( > 4 MJ/
Nm3 air blown) with specific water inflows of between 0 to 1 ton/ton.
If the specific water inflow is high and the coal gasification rate is
low, then the cold gas efficiency suffers and the syngas quality is
poor.

Pgasification front will not catastrophically block the flow path of the
oxidant and syngas. However, as the P-CRIP design requires the dril-
ling of two horizontal wells it is generally more costly than the L-
CRIP design. A major uncertainty of the P-CRIP is whether a perpen-
dicular retraction of the gasification face can be made over a long
distance ( > 500 m). In the case of the Bloodwood Creek Panel 2 proj-
ect, the transition from the Knife-edge section to the parallel well
section was not completed and the electroseismic data indicate that
the gasification front was elongated towards the production well
[33]. However, Haines and Mallett indicate this was because of low
oxidant injection rates required by regulators [33]. In principal, irre-
spective of the flow rate, the temperatures in the combustion zone
(near injection well) should be hotter than those in the reducing
zone (near production well), implying that the front should move
along the injection well more quickly than along the production
well, leading to a skewed gasification front and incomplete resource
recovery between the two wells. In extreme situations, the cavity
development of the P-CRIP could evolve into something similar to a
very long L-CRIP. If the coal in the vicinity of the production well can
not be converted to syngas, then the addition of the horizontal pro-
duction well may increase the cost of producing syngas. Another
issue with the P-CRIP design is the propensity of tars to cool and
restrict or block the production well during start up. This issue was
observed during the Gasifier 4 project at Chinchilla and was a con-
tributing factor to the selection of the L-CRIP design in Gasifier 5.
However similar issues were not reported at the Bloodwood Creek
project. If the target coal is high in volatiles and produces significant
tar then the start up operations of a long cold horizontal production
well may become very challenging. It is often hard to distinguish
between design and operational effects when evaluating the perfor-
mance of a particular design. For example, it is not known whether a
more aggressive ramp up of oxidant flows in Gasifier 4 could have
avoided the condensation of tars and what role coal cuttings left
over from drilling operations played in the start up operations.

PThere is sufficient experience with both the L-CRIP and P-CRIP
design to state that they appear feasible from both the technical and
economic perspectives. Each design has its own characteristics and
the specific gasifier design should be chosen with respect to site con-
ditions, in particular the propensity of the over-burden to spall and
collapse. Despite the very different nature of the gas flow paths in
the L-CRIP and P-CRIP design, the process performance of the two
methods appears quite similar. Table 16 shows a comparison of the
Rocky Mountain I K-CRIP performance with steam/oxygen with the
Chinchilla Gasifier 5 L-CRIP performance on water/oxygen. Gas com-
positions, gas heating values and oxygen utilization efficiency are

Fig. 30. Common gasifier designs: (a) Linked Vertical Wells, (b) L-CRIP and (c) P-CRIP

Pquite comparable. Table 17 shows a comparison of the Bloodwood
Creek Panel 2 P-CRIP performance on air with the Chinchilla Gasifier
5 L-CRIP performance on air (these two projects are operated in the
same coal). The gas compositions show an effect of the water gas
shift, especially in the P-CRIP design and the gas heating values and
oxygen utilization efficiency are quite comparable. It appears that
the P-CRIP design led to a slightly higher heating value of syngas in
the Bloodwood Creek demonstration and this may have been due to
the longer pyrolysis zone in the P-CRIP design and/or the slightly
higher pressure of the gasifier at the location of this particular site.

PIn the Rocky Mountain I demonstration a P-CRIP module and a
ELW module were operated in the same coal seam using the same
facilities. This side-by-side demonstration enables some insights

Pinto the effect of the well configuration and gasification method on
process performance. The CRIP process had better process efficiency
and better resource recovery than the ELW module [26,96].

PIn summary, it can be concluded that a CRIP design will have
superior performance to a LVW or ELW design and that a P-CRIP and
L-CRIP design will likely give similar process performance in the
same coal. The choice of CRIP design should therefore take into
account the details of the under- and over-burden properties and
coal behaviour upon heating and make an evaluation of the costs of
syngas production in each case. Uncertainties in both designs relate
mostly to the overall resource recovery and changes in performance
which may occur from start up to shut down due to very long hori-
zontal well lengths.

4.7. Effect of site conditions

PThere are many site factors which influence the process, includ-
ing under- and over-burden properties and hydro-geological proper-
ties of the formation, in addition to those already considered such as
oxidant and coal properties.

PFig. 32 shows the effect of specific water inflow on the syngas
heating value using air blown gasification. In general the higher the
specific water inflow then the lower the syngas heating value. To
achieve high gasification efficiency and a good quality syngas, the
specific water inflow should be between 0 and 1 ton/ton based on
this data. The specific water inflow will be a function of the perme-
ability and saturation of the formations in the vicinity of the UCG

PThe overall performance of the project generally depends simul-
taneously on a number of factors related to the coal properties, site
conditions, gasifier design and operations. A common performance
goal is to successfully convert large quantities of coal into syngas.
Therefore, for the purposes of reviewing the effect of site conditions,
the quantity of coal converted is taken to be the primary indicator of
success. On this measure, Table 18 shows some of the more success-
ful and some of the less successful UCG demonstration projects that
have been conducted. Based on the historical data, the more success-
ful projects have typically been performed in relatively shallow coals
( < 300 m), which are moderately thick (6(cid:1)10 m), have low rank
(sub-bituminous coals or lignite), surrounded by shales, clays or
sandstones and have utilized a CRIP gasifier design. The less success-
ful projects have been performed in either very shallow or relatively
deep coals, which are reasonably thin ( < 7 m) and which are of
higher rank, such as bituminous coals and anthracites.

PExamination of each individual project can reveal the particular
issues which led to the poor results and can now serve as lessons to
be heeded in future development. For example, in the Hoe Creek tri-
als conducted in the USA, the shallow nature of the Felix coal seams
( < 50 m deep, with Felix #1 and #2 separated by only 5 m) and the
very weak and wet sandy over-burden materials were the main site
factors which lead to poor process control and eventually to signifi-
cant subsidence and release of volatile hydrocarbons into the envi-
ronment [97,98]. The removal of large amounts of coal in the Hoe
Creek II and III trials served to hydraulically connect three aquifers
(two coal seams and a sand aquifer) via collapse of over-burden rub-
ble [99]. The Hoe Creek trials highlight that UCG should be under-
taken with sufficient competent over-burden materials and away
from good quality water aquifers. Care must also be taken, when
performing UCG in locations with multiple coal seams, where there
is a chance that operations in the deepest coal, may interact with the
overlying coal seam.

PThe El Tremedal project was highly sophisticated using modern
directional drilling and coiled tubing technologies to drill and con-
trol the processes within the wells. Unfortunately, the site chosen
had a very sandy over-burden and overlying acquifer. Oxygen injec-
tion volumes were relatively low at 100 to 400 Nm3/h [100]. An
explosion occurred in the underground reactor, and within a short
time, uncontrollable water influx made control of the gasification
process very difficult. A second attempt at gasification operations
was made, however it only lasted a few days [90].

PThe Swan Hills project used oil and gas technology and equip-
ment and successfully produced syngas in a very deep coal
( > 1400 m) for the first time [34]. However, the blow out of the
injection well highlights the challenges of undertaking UCG reliably
at high pressures.

PFrom a bird’s eye perspective, this summary indicates that future
UCG projects in high rank and/or relatively deep ( > 500 m) coals
will need to pay particular attention to design and operational
issues, in order to mitigate the historical challenges of operating

PUCG under these conditions. From an environmental and economic
perspective, development of UCG technology to operate successfully
in deeper coals is of particular importance.

5. Economics of syngas production

PThe economics of UCG has been reported on extensively over the
years, particularly for specific project conditions [5,102,103]. The
major capital cost items associated with UCG are: 1) oxidant produc-
tion facilities, 2) injection piping and surface facilities, 3) well dril-
ling and completion, production piping and surface facilities.
Recently, Perkins and Vairakannu have developed a simplified model
which estimates the oxidant and drilling costs [104]. The net present
cost of syngas ($/GJ) is given by Eq. (2):

PUsing the above relation, it is possible to derive that the cost
of syngas is a function of the following main variables as shown in
Eq. (3):-

where a is the areal energy density a 1⁄4 GCVrH; GCV is the gross cal-
orific value of the coal, r is the density, L is the length of the horizon-
tal well, H is the thickness of the coal seam, W is the width of a
cavity, h is the ratio of width to height, z is the cavity shape factor
and e is the cold gas efficiency, which is adversely affected by heat
loss and excessive water influx. Therefore, the unit cost of syngas is
reduced by: higher areal energy density, a; higher cold gas effi-
ciency, e; higher shape factor, z ; higher width to height ratio, h;
_msyngas. The cost of syngas is
thicker coal, H and larger project scales,
increased by: higher fuel costs, pfuel and higher drilling costs, Cwells.

PThe cost of drilling wells may be estimated as a function of the
depth (pressure) and length of the horizontal well, i.e.: Cwells/f(Poper-
ating, L). Typically, longer horizontal wells lead to lower costs per vol-
ume of coal accessed, up to a point. Similarly, higher operating
pressures, Poperating, increase drilling costs but lead to improved cold
gas efficiency. In the following sections, the economic impacts of
several design and operational choices are examined in detail. Base
case conditions and further details of the model are given in Perkins
and Vairakannu [104].

5.1. Impact of oxidant choice

PFig. 33 shows indicative syngas costs based on the oxidant and
drilling cost for air, steam/O2 and water/O2 blown gasification. Per-
kins and Vairakannu have discussed the considerations for oxidant
and gasifying medium selection in UCG [104]. When considering

Fig. 34. Effect of areal energy density on the cost of syngas due to oxidant and drilling
costs for a range of drilling costs per well pair.

Ppair drilling costs of 1(cid:1)5 $million USD. It can be seen that costs
decrease inversely with areal energy density. For coal seams with
a (cid:4) 100 GJ/m2 oxidant and drilling costs are very high. For coal
seams with a (cid:5) 200 GJ/m2 the oxidant and drilling costs are rela-
tively low and do not reduce significantly with further increases in
the areal energy density [104]. Table 19 shows the calculated areal
energy density of the coal seams from a variety of UCG projects con-
ducted in the past. Also note, that the more successful UCG projects
generally had high areal energy density.

5.3. Impact of production well capacity

PWhen considering an injection-production well pair, what is a
preferred production capacity? The cold gas efficiency drops off at
low oxidant injection rates [54,55]. In addition, if the production
capacity of each well-pair is low, then more well pairs must be
drilled to produce the syngas required by the downstream user.
Therefore, it is generally desirable to have high syngas production
capacity per well pair. However, there are practical limits to drilling
wells suitable for handling high temperature syngas. Fig. 35 shows
the oxidant and drilling costs as a function of the syngas flow per
production well for four different oxidants. It can be seen that higher
syngas flow per well reduces the syngas cost, but if the syngas flow
per production well is » 10,000 Nm3/h then any additional cost sav-
ings are relatively small. Fortunately, at » 10,000 Nm3/h, production
tubing sizes of 400 to 700 are satisfactory, which is within the range of
typical oil and gas well sizes. The successful UCG demonstration
projects at Chinchilla and Bloodwood Creek both produced up to
5000 Nm3/h of syngas [31,33].

Fig. 33. Effect of oxidant selection on the cost of syngas due to oxidant and drilling
costs: (a) Effect of production scale and (b) Effect of well pair drilling cost (data from
Perkins and Vairakannu [104]).

Pproduction scale, Fig. 33(a) indicates that air yields the lowest syngas
costs for demonstration and small scale projects, however above an
energy production rate of » 200 MWch (which corresponds to
approximately 50 MWe using open-cycle and 100 MWe using com-
bined-cycle gas turbines) oxygen blown gasification with water and
(potentially) steam become more attractive. Fig. 33(b) shows the
impact of the cost of drilling an injection-production well pair for an
underground coal gasifier on the costs at a scale of 300 MWch.

5.2. Impact of coal areal energy density

PFig. 34 shows the cost of oxidant and drilling costs as a function
of the coal’s areal energy density, a, for injection-production well

Pindustries, in particular using experience from thermal wells used
for heavy oil recovery [111]. UCG production wells which can handle
temperatures up to 400 °C have been operated for several years
without issue, when designed and constructed according to these
guidelines [31]. Operational procedures and safety systems must
also be implemented to prevent well blowouts like the one experi-
enced at Swan Hills [74].

PSubsidence of the surface ground due to UCG is another potential
impact, and it depends heavily on the formation depth (D) and thick-
ness (H), strength of formation materials and the width (W) of the
zones of coal conversion [112,113]. The subsidence, d, from UCM is
correlated as d / W ¢ H ¢ D(cid:1)1 [114]. Thus, surface subsidence has been
observed in many UCG projects operated at shallow depth and in
moderate to thick coal seams. For example, the Hoe Creek III demon-
stration developed a substantial surface crater, because the chosen
site was only 40 m deep and also had weak and wet over-burden
material [97,98]. Derbin et al. reports on Soviet experience where
subsidence of up to 2.2 m was measured in projects at depths of
50 m or less; and subsidence of up to 1.2 m was measured in projects
at depths with clay overburden at depths up to 120 m [112]. When
UCG has been conducted in deeper coal seams with strong over-bur-
den materials there has been negligible surface subsidence. For
example, there have been no recorded subsidence issues at the dem-
onstration projects conducted at Chinchilla and Bloodwood Creek in
Australia [31,65]. Similarly, when UCG has been conducted in deeper
coal seams at El Tremedal, Thulin and Swan Hills there have been no
surface subsidence impacts [27,34,62,115]. The risk of surface subsi-
dence can be mitigated through site investigation and selection and
via application of geomechanical models to appropriately design the
gasifier field layout.

6.2. Groundwater pollution

PThe major concerns for pollution of the groundwater comes from
the release of organics such as BTEX, phenols and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) during coal pyrolysis and gasification, the
release of heavy metals during gasification and from leaching of
inorganic materials from residual char and ash once gasification has
ceased [116]. The main inorganics include a wide range of ionic spe-
cies, such as sodium (Naþ), calcium (Ca2þ), sulphate (SO2(cid:1)
4 ), bicarbon-
3), chlorine (Cl(cid:1)), ammonia (NH3), fluoride (F(cid:1)) and bromide
ate (HCO(cid:1)
(Br(cid:1)) [116]. Other substances of interest include metals, arsenic and
boron.

PThe extent and concentration of groundwater pollution depends
primarily on groundwater flow velocity, dispersion and the reaction
and adsorption of various contaminants. Managing the risk of
groundwater contamination in the vicinity of UCG needs to be a
major focus for site selection, design and operational activities.

PMany organic contaminants such as BTEX, phenols and PAHs are
dense in comparison to syngas and condense preferentially into the
liquid phase at lower temperatures, thus they do not travel far from
the UCG cavity. In addition, they are not very soluble in water [109].
According to field results reported by Mead et al., the phenols con-
centration decreases rapidly with time and with distance from the
gasification zone [117]. The adsorption of coal and surrounding
strata makes a substantial contribution to the decrease of contami-
nant concentrations over time and with distance from the gasifica-
tion zone. Table 20 shows the decrease of phenolic concentrations
measured as a function of distance and time in the vicinity of the
Hoe Creek I UCG demonstration project. The reduction of phenol
concentration with time has been attributed to the sorption of phe-
nols by coal, as confirmed in laboratory experiments [117]. Similar
results have been reported for UCG projects conducted in the former
U.S.S.R [116].

PIn regards to organic contaminants, Table 21 shows the concen-
trations of various substances at 6, 83 and 762 days after gasification

Fig. 35. Effect of syngas capacity per production well on the cost of syngas due to oxi-
dant and drilling costs for four different oxidants.

5.4. Summary

PIn summary, this simple analysis of syngas production economics
facilitates the development of two rules of thumb: 1) to select sites
with areal energy density of » 200 GJ/m2 or greater and 2) to size
each injection-production well pair to produce » 10,000 Nm3/h or
more of syngas.

PRecently, Pei et al. compared the costs of UCG combined cycle
(UCGCC) power projects with conventional pulverized coal (PC)
plants, natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) and integrated gasifica-
tion combined cycle (IGCC) configurations [105,106]. UCGCC was
forecast to cost » 45 $/MWh and provide the lowest cost of power
when the natural gas (NG) price was less than » 4.50 $/GJ [105].
When carbon capture and storage (CCS) was also included, NGCC-
CCS had the lowest generation costs when the NG price was less
than 4.50 $/GJ and UCG-CCS had the lowest generation costs when
NG was priced more than 4.50 $/GJ [105].

6. Environmental considerations

PIn UCG, the process considerations cannot be separated from the
environmental considerations because they are intimately related.
Unlike with conventional surface coal gasification facilities wherein
the reactor environment is totally engineered and controlled, the
performance of in situ gasification is significantly impacted by the
geologic and hydrogeologic setting in which it is operated [107]. As a
result the design and operation of any UCG operation must be based
on a fundamental knowledge of the gasification site. Fig. 36 shows a
schematic of how a UCG operation could impact on the air, surface
soils, surface waters, underground rocks and groundwaters. In the
following sections the potential surface impacts, subsurface impacts
and greenhouse gas emissions are briefly reviewed.

6.1. Surface impacts

PUCG operations can in principle lead to the escape of product
gases into the air and surface soils and the deformation and subsi-
dence of the surface topography. The most likely pathway for prod-
uct gases to reach the surface air or shallow soils is via the wells
(injection, production, monitoring) drilled from the surface. There-
fore, the design of the casing and cement of the wells is very impor-
tant. Younger and Bhat discuss various well design issues [108,109].
High temperature cements are available from major oil field service
companies (e.g. [110]). To reduce the risk of well integrity issues,
design rules and best practices can be adapted from the oil and gas

Fig. 36. Potential environmental impacts of UCG.

Pmeasured in a well 44 m from the UCG cavity. It can be seen, that
within 2.5 years after gasification, the concentrations of almost all
organics of interest were zero. Trace concentrations of toluene, ethyl
benzene and xylene were present.

PSeveral studies have identified inorganic substances in ground-
water due to the coal gasification process. In general it is expected
that the concentration of inorganic contaminants increases as a
result of leaching of the ash and char materials left behind after gasi-
fication. Table 22 shows results of water analyses before and after
the Hoe Creek I experiment.

PDuring the Rocky Mountain I project, thorough investigation and
analysis of the baseline water conditions, the produced water quality
and the water quality in the coal seam after gasification was con-
ducted. In addition, reports of the project from site characterisation
through operations to shutdown are available. Detailed reports of
the changes in groundwater quality have been published (cid:1) see
for example Barbour et al. [60], Boysen et al. [96], Lindblom
[61,119,120] and Covell et al. [121]. Table 23 shows a comparison of
the baseline water analyses, the produced water analyses and the
highest reported concentrations in the coal seam wells for the CRIP
module. It can be seen that the water produced from the process is
high in phenols, organics, ammonia, total dissolved solids and some
metals. This produced water is collected from the production well
during operations and is often considered representative of that
which could be in the cavity (if temperatures were low enough).
However, within less than three years of the gasification operations,

the coal seam wells surrounding the project. As of June 1991 the
only baseline condition that was not met, was the elevated levels of
boron detected in both the ELW and CRIP modules of the project
[119].

chilla, Australia showed that the concentration levels of benzene,
phenol and PAHs in the vicinity of the gasifier were » 10 mg/L,
» 100 mg/L and » 10 mg/L, respectively [66]. Outside of the active

Pgasification zone concentrations were less than 1 mg/L and within
the range of the measured background values for the region [66].

PMallett has reported on the environmental performance of the
UCG projects at the Bloodwood Creek site in Australia [72,73]. In
Panel 2, within 48 h of the air injection being halted, the gasification
reactions had ceased and the gasifier pressure was reduced to pro-
mote groundwater inflow, to produce steam and reduce the cavity
temperatures below 300 °C [72]. Groundwater inflow and steam
production continued for nine months, during which time » 92% of
the organic chemicals were entrained in the vent gases produced to
surface (see Table 5). Contaminant fate and transport modelling
showed that a safe concentration of benzene of 1 mg/L would be
obtained within 27 m of the cavity; a safe concentration of phenol of
85 mg/L would be obtained within 4.5 m of the cavity and that a safe
concentration of naphthalene of 2 mg/L would be obtained within
0.5 m of the cavity [72]. Since in situ groundwater does not pose any
significant health or environmental risk, and no use of the ground-
water is envisaged over the period of declining concentrations, the
remedial approach adopted is monitored natural attenuation; i.e.
wait for groundwater conditions to recover [72].

PThe Rocky Mountain I, Chinchilla and Bloodwood Creek UCG
projects show that groundwater pollution is not intrinsic to the UCG
process and impacts can be managed with appropriate site selection,
gasifier design and operations [122]. In these projects, the so-called
“Clean Cavern Concept” was implemented, in which the gasfier is
operated such that:

P1. the operating pressure is kept below the surrounding formation
pressure during and after operations to minimise escape of
pyrolysis products and ensure a positive flux of groundwater
towards the cavity

P2. once gasification is terminated, pyrolysis products are vented

from the cavity

P3. cavity temperatures are reduced via groundwater influx as
quickly as possible once gasification is terminated, to minimise
the release of more pyrolysis products

PWhile Boysen et al. argue that injection of steam in the post-gasi-
fication cavity is beneficial to strip residual hydrocarbons from the
cavity [96], the results from Rocky Mountain I and Bloodwood Creek
show that most of the steam used to entrain the organic chemicals is
made from the evaporation of groundwater flowing into the hot cav-
ities. In the Rocky Mountain I project, the cavity water was pumped
twice and treated before being released into the environment at sur-
face. The total water pumped and treated per ton of coal gasified
was circa 0.85 t/t.

PRecent European work on the potential of groundwater contami-
nation from organic and inorganic pollutants generated in the pro-
cess of coal gasification has been reported [77,123(cid:1)126].

6.3. Groundwater depletion

PMost of the UCG demonstration projects that have been con-
ducted show a drawdown of the formation pressure during opera-
tions. This is a result of the fact, that the operating pressure of UCG
is kept below that of the surrounding formation pressure, thus pro-
viding a driving force for water influx. The coal gasification process
consumes water to produce CO and H2 via the steam gasification

Preaction. The drawdown in pressure during operations implies that
the UCG surface facilities will need to be designed for a range of
pressures. This is one reason why targeting deeper coal seams for
UCG in the future should be attractive, as in these cases, the draw-
down as a percentage of the baseline pressure will be much lower,
making the design of surface facilities much easier.

PThe impacts of groundwater depletion may be mitigated by
injecting freshwater or re-injecting treated produced water back
into the formation surrounding the UCG gasifiers. The effectiveness
of this approach will likely depend on a variety of factors, including
the permeability of the coal and over-burden formations. There is no
reported literature examining these issues using numerical models.

6.4. Greenhouse gas emissions

PThe carbon emissions of energy technologies are of high social
importance. It is generally accepted that global carbon emissions
must fall if the world is to limit greenhouse gas warming to within
1.5(cid:1)2 °C of pre-industrial levels [127]. While coal is generally plenti-
ful and relatively cheap, it is a high carbon fuel, which releases high
levels of CO2 when combusted per unit of energy produced.

PFig. 37 shows a comparison of the lifecycle grenhouse gas emis-
sions from conventional power generation technologies and UCG,
with and without CCS. The reported values of IGCC and UCG with
CCS exclude the use of a water gas shift unit. Beath et al. calculated
that with the inclusion of CCS and shift the greenhouse gas emis-
sions would be 149 kgCO2eq/MWh for IGCC and 333 kgCO2eq/MWh
for UCG [91]. The emissions for the IGCC unit with shift are lower
than for UCG due to the fact that almost all of the carbon in the syn-
gas is in the form of CO, whereas in UCG the carbon present in CH4
cannot be shifted to H2 and CO2. A recent study by Hyder et al. com-
pared the emissions for power generation from UCG using combined
cycle gas turbines (CCGT), integrated surface gasification with CCGT,
pulverized coal combustion with supercritical steam and pulverized
coal combustion with saturated steam [128]. This work estimated
greenhouse gas emissions of UCG to power projects of 774 kgCO2eq/
MWh. A recent study by Doucet et al. estimates that a UCG project
with combined cycle gas turbines and CO2 capture from the syngas
(without a water gas shift unit) would emit 389 kgCO2eq/MWh
which is similar to both the emissions from a surface IGCC plant
with CO2 capture and the emissions from natual gas using combined
cycle gas turbines [11].

Fig. 37. Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of UCG for power generation as compared
with conventional coal and natural gas technologies (data from Wibberley et al. [129],
Beath et al. [91], Hyder et al. [128] and Doucet et al. [11]).

Fig. 38. Emissions of SOx and NOx from UCG for power generation as compared with
conventional coal and natural gas technologies (data from Blinderman and Jones
[65]).

PIn the case of making liquid fuels, Perkins et al. estimate that the
well to wheels emissions from a coal to liquids project using UCG
with CO2 capture for use in enhanced oil recovery would be similar
to existing emissions from crude oil based transportation fuels [12].
PThe emissions of SOx and NOx from a variety of coal and natural
gas power generation technologies are summarized in Fig. 38. The
UCG SOx emissions are much lower than pulverized coal combustion
due to the gas clean up unit (typically either Amine, Selexol(cid:1) or Rec-
tisol(cid:1)). The NOx emissions are also very low when compared to both
pulverized coal and natural gas combustion.

6.5. Carbon capture and storage

PWhile CCS has been implemented on a large scale for several nat-
ural gas production projects, its application to coal is much less
widespread. The major challenges with coupling CCS with coal com-
bustion and gasification are both technical and economic. From the
technical perspective, finding suitable geologic storage sites within
the vicinity of locations where coal is being used has been a chal-
lenge. From the economic perspective, when using coal, there is a
much greater amount of CO2 per unit of energy produced. Thus sepa-
ration and re-compression of CO2 from either coal derived syngas or
coal derived flue gas is energy intensive and expensive. Where proj-
ects have been undertaken, the CO2 is mostly being used for
enhanced oil recovery and therefore can be assigned a monetary
value in producing more oil. A number of coal projects with CCS
have recently been constructed including Saskpower’s post-combus-
tion capture Boundary Dam project in Saskatchewan, Canada [130];
the Petra Nova post-combustion capture project in Texas, USA [131];
and the Kemper County IGCC project with pre-combustion capture
located in Mississippi, USA [132].

PAssessment of the potential to sequester CO2 inside UCG cavities
has been reported by several authors (e.g. [3,109,133]). Estimates
show that only a portion of the CO2 emitted from UCG could be
stored in the cavities based on the volumes available [134]. Younger
has proposed that the excess CO2 could be stored in the deformed
strata above the coal seam and has calculated that a height of
between 10 and 60 times the coal seam thickness would be suffi-
cient to store all of the CO2, depending upon the porosity of the over-
lying strata [109]. There are significant uncertainties regarding the
ability of the formations subjected to UCG to safely contain the CO2
[134,135]. The concept may be technically feasible, if the coal is
located deep enough and the formation materials are suitable.

7. Guidelines for site and oxidant selection

PIt is now well established that the use of the CRIP technique with
directionally drilled wells provides compelling advantages over
methods like the linked vertical wells (LVW) or the extended link
well (ELW). As such the main decisions that a UCG project designer
will need to make to achieve both economic and environmental KPIs
are related to the selection of the site and selection of the oxidant to
be used in the project.

PTable 24 provides a summary of guidelines for the selection of a
suitable UCG site, based on a combination of experience and prior
work [51,109,136(cid:1)138]. It should be recognized that since experi-
ence with UCG at large scales is still immature, the site selection
parameters can only be considered as guidelines, and can not be

Pconsidered as criteria. In any particular project, there could to good
reasons to vary one or more parameters. In general a good UCG site
will have several characteristics including: flat lying sub-bituminous
coal at a moderate or greater depth, with a thickness of more than
6 m and with low structural complexity, surrounded by strong and
low permeability formations in a location with a high existing
hydraulic pressure and no significant acquifers in the vicinity. When
projects are proposed with parameters substantially outside of these
proposed guidelines, additional risk management strategies should
be utilized to address the fact that there is a lot less experience with
UCG in the proposed conditions.

PIn terms of oxidant selection, Table 25 provides guidelines based
on the coal properties, coal depth and desired end use for the syngas.
In general air blown gasification may be considered for

Enriched-air blown gasification may be suitable for power genera-
tion applications. For large scale projects and/or when coal seams
are deeper, oxygen blown gasification using water/O2 and steam/O2
should be considered [104]. There is very little experience with the
use of CO2/O2 oxidant mixtures in UCG projects.

8. Conclusions

PThis paper has provided a comprehensive review of underground
coal gasification, with a particular emphasis on describing UCG
methods and the results of previous field demonstrations. Under-
ground coal gasification is not a new concept, however despite
many decades of development, the process has not been imple-
mented commercially outside of the former U.S.S.R. The complexity
of UCG results from the fact that there are strong interactions
between chemical, thermal and mechanical processes occurring dur-
ing gasification. The UCG process is strongly impacted by the proper-
ties of the coal, surrounding strata and the environment. The factors
which affect the performance of UCG such as oxidant choice, coal
properties, coal seam depth and thickness, process scale, gasifier
design and site conditions have been reviewed. Work in the past sev-
eral decades has shown that application of the controlled retracting
injection point (CRIP) method has many advantages over earlier
methods such as linked vertical wells and results in superior perfor-
mance. A brief review of the economic factors and environmental
considerations for undertaking UCG projects has been performed.
Guidelines for the selection of sites and the choice of oxidant in
future UCG projects have been provided.
