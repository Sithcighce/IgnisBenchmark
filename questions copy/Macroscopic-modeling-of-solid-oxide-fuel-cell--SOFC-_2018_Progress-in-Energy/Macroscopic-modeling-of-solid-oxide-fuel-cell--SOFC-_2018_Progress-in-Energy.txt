Contents

In addition to high energy conversion efficiency and considerable fuel flexibility, the advantage of high-
quality exhaust energy of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) allows it to be combined with gas turbines (GT) to
form a SOFC/GT hybrid generation system. This article makes a comprehensive review on the state of the
art of macroscopic SOFC models and model-based control of the SOFC/GT hybrid system. Several topics in
modeling of electrochemistry and transport in SOFC are first presented, including multi-component mass
transfer, internal reforming, detailed radiative heat transfer, surface diffusion, and our new viewpoints on
H2/CO electrochemical co-oxidation and physical resolution of electrochemical impedance spectra, etc.
Then the SOFC models are summarized in different dimensions and from steady-state to transient. After a
basic summary of the balancing unit models, the issues of system layout, safe operation region, off-design
and part-load operation, load following, control strategies, decentralized/centralized controllers, and hard-
ware-in-the-loop simulation of the SOFC/GT hybrid system are investigated. Some useful data have been
sorted out in tabular form for easy access. The analytical solutions can play an important role in bridging
the gap between mechanistic and system-level models. Some perspectives on the advanced models and
model-based control are finally presented.

1. Introduction

PSolid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a device which directly converts the
free energy of a chemical reactant to electrical energy and heat. Not
restricted by the Carnot cycle, SOFC has a high energy conversion
efficiency up to 60% to 80%, and it is very suitable for distributed
generation system and has a broad application prospect. Besides the
properties of high efficiency, low emission and high-quality exhaust
heat, which allows forming a hybrid system with gas turbine (GT) or
micro gas turbine (MGT), fuel flexibility is another significant advan-
tage of SOFC compared to the low-temperature fuel cells [1(cid:1)14].

PModeling and simulation are essential for research and develop-
ment of SOFC and SOFC-based systems [15]. Fig. 1 describes the
multi-level modeling of SOFC and SOFC/GT system from the elec-
trode level to the system level. The component of SOFC and the qual-
ity of SOFC models are the core to distinguish the SOFC/GT hybrid
system to other kinds of energy systems. The modeling work on
SOFC and system can be simply divided into steady-state and tran-
sient models from the aspect of whether the dynamic behaviors are
considered or not, and ranges from zero-dimensional (0D) to three-
dimensional (3D) according to the spatial perspective of models
[16]. The 3D and two-dimensional (2D) SOFC models are generally
used in the analysis of cell structure accounting for the detailed
mass and heat transfer, while the 0D and 1D SOFC models have
advantages in the analysis of thermodynamic performance, a funda-
mental study of electrochemistry and process control with control-
oriented modeling. How to present the dominant phenomena of
electrochemistry and transport is the key of a SOFC model with a
proper complexity. There is generally a big gap between the mecha-
nistic and system-level SOFC models, as the latter cannot afford the
high computational cost of the former. With this regard, deep under-
standing the fundamentals, and meanwhile making a balance
between model accuracy and computational cost are big challenges,
as a solution, the analytical approximations and efficiently computa-
tional algorithms arepredicted to play an important role. There are
also steady-state & transient and multi-dimensional models in GT,

Preformer and other key balancing units in the hybrid system, for dif-
ferent requirements of analysis.

POptimization, analysis of transient behaviors and system control
is of great significance to the system integration and commercial
operation of fuel cell system. The optimal steady-state performance
determines the design point of a system and also the objective of
system control. Following the load variation, a fuel cell system
should make the proper generation output at the part-load and off-
design point. A safe operation should be always met without violat-
ing the limit of some key performance, including the SOFC operating
temperature, maximum temperature gradient, turbine inlet temper-
ature, steam/carbon ratio, compressor surge margin, etc. Parametric
analysis is generally implemented to identify the influence of some
key variables, e.g. fuel/air flow rate and current, etc., on the system
performance. Different system layouts could result in different pro-
files of parametric analysis in the amount or even in the trend. At
present, the research of SOFC/GT hybrid generation system is gener-
ally based on numerical analysis, at the same time, the Siemens-
Westinghouse Power Corporation (SWPC) 220 kW demonstration
hybrid system is the most widely used prototype for model valida-
tion [17]. In addition, hardware-in-the-loop simulation technology
has been used for system pre-integration.

PA fuel cell system is typically multi-input-multi-output (MIMO),
in which manipulated and controlled variables are normally charac-
terized by nonlinear strong couple. Different control strategies of the
fuel cell system have been widely discussed, for example, the strat-
egy of constant fuel utilization or constant cell temperature, or both
at the same time, etc. Especially, to meet the real-time variation of
the electric load, which is determined by consumers’ demand and
therefore acts as an external disturbance of the system, the strategy
of load following has been paid much attention to. The multiple
objectives with multi-scale time constants (e.g. fuel/air flow control
and SOFC temperature control) and their interactions make chal-
lenges of the controller design. Correspondingly, different control
algorithms have been investigated, including decentralized control-
ler with multiple control loops, centralized controllers, linear and

generally used as the power control unit, in this aspect, the control
algorithms of power electronic devices and microgrid are also
involved in.

PFig. 2 shows a macroscopic modeling framework of natural gas
internal reforming (IR) SOFC- MGT hybrid generation system, of
which the main concept is multi-level and hierarchical modeling
[18]. Taking an example of SOFC modeling, (1) in electrode level:
there are general models including H2/CO electrochemical co-oxida-
tion and multi-component mass transfer, advanced models with
surface diffusion and competition absorption, elementary heteroge-
neous mechanisms, approximate analytical solutions of electro-
chemistry and transport in porous electrode; (2) in cell or stack
level: there are multi-dimensional models for spatial profiles of cur-
rent density, temperature, overpotential with detailed hydraulic/
thermal modeling of channel flow. The models of balancing units,
including GT, reformer, heat exchangers, etc., are also developed
with different complexity. So the model libraries are established and
can be configured flexibly according to different requests of simula-
tion on various process flowsheets. Then, in both time and frequency
domains, the transient behaviors of the system are analyzed and the
controllers are designed based on appropriate control strategies.
Furthermore,
the hardware-in-the-loop simulation could be
designed for system pre-integration. Note that, as a unique feature
of this framework, the analytical approximations is paid much atten-
tion to establish a bridge between mechanistic and empirical models
and contribute fast and accurate computation, especially for control-
ler design and real-time simulation.

PIn this paper, we carry out a comprehensive review of study on
modeling of SOFC, and also model-based optimization and control
of the SOFC/GT hybrid system. The state of the art of the SOFC
models in different dimensions will be firstly summarized, mean-
while, some specific topics on electrochemistry and transport will
be emphasized. For the SOFC/GT hybrid system, models of balanc-
ing units, especially the MGT models, are simply summarized and
different system layouts are introduced. Then the model-based
analysis is investigated in the region of safe operation, design/off-
design, part-load and dynamic characteristics, control strategies
and controller designs. Finally, conclusions and some perspectives

modeling and control of molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) and

Ppolymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems are also
included.

2. SOFC

2.1. Working principle

PThe core of SOFC is the sandwich combination of anode, cathode
and electrolyte layer, which together are often called the membrane-
electrode assembly (MEA) or positive-electrolyte-negative (PEN). The
electrolyte layer is a good conductor of oxygen ions, which plays a
key role in separating fuel (e.g. H2, CO, CH4) from oxygen. The anode
and the cathode are typically formed by a mixture of electronic (el)
conductor and ionic (ion) conductor materials, and also the porous
structure is presented, as a result, to make the triple phase bound-
aries (TPBs) for electron, ion, and gas transport. In the cathode, oxy-
gen ions are generated from reduction of oxygen (1/2O2 + 2e¡!
O2¡), and then conducted through the electrolyte layer to the anode.
In the anode, as shown in Fig. 3, when methane is used as fuel, the
reforming reaction (CH4 + 2H2O $ 3H2 + CO2) and the water gas shift
reaction (CO + H2O $ H2 + CO2) take place, and also electrochemical
oxidation of H2, CO (H2 + O2¡ ! H2O + 2e¡, CO + O2¡! CO2 + 2e¡)
and even CH4 itself (CH4 + 4O2¡ ! CO2 + 2H2O + 8e¡) occur and the
electrons flow through the external electric load and generate cur-
rent. During this process, the Gibbs free energy of the overall oxida-
tion reaction of
is
converted into electricity, and the irreversible part is released as heat
[1]. Meanwhile, some side reactions, e.g. carbon deposit due to CO
hydrogenation (CO + H2 $ C + H2O) and Boudouard reaction (2CO $
C + CO2), etc., might also take place.

PThere have been different geometric designs of SOFC [1], anyway,
planar and tubular configurations are still the two most principle
and important designs. The planar design has advantages of the sim-
ple preparation process, low cost, short current path, uniform cur-
rent collection and high power density. However, it brings stringent
request on the gas seal and has a poor performance against thermal
cycling. Compared to the electrolyte-supported design at an early
stage, the high performance of the anode-supported planar SOFC
(PSOFC) has attracted a lot of interests. With a geometry closed at
one end, the tubular design alleviates the problems with gas seals
and thin layer structure fabrication, and therefore, the tubular SOFC

P(TSOFC) can be much easier for scale-up of the stack. However, the
high ohmic loss and the low power density due to long current path
limit the performance of TSOFCs, although it could be somehow
compensated by being operated at high temperature and gas pres-
sure. Fig. 4 shows the section in an anode-supported planar design
and in the SWPC tubular design of SOFC [19].

2.2. Macroscopic modeling topics

PThe complex phenomena in SOFC, including flow, heat transfer,
multicomponent mass transfer, electrochemical and chemical

Preactions, have attracted a lot of interests of modeling work [20].
The study of modeling and simulation on SOFCs have entered the era
of multiscale. The recent review [21] has highlighted a variety of
studies on modeling and simulation techniques across the length
scales in orders for chemical and physical processes in the SOFC sys-
tem. The micro-scale approaches (e.g. Density Functional Theory,
Molecular Dynamics and Quantum Chemistry, etc.) aim to provide
fundamental analysis of quantum (sub-atomic) to atomistic behav-
iors. The mesoscale approaches (such as Monte Carlo and Lattice-
Boltzmann method, etc.) are usually applied to implement the pore-
scale simulation based on the reconstruction model of the electrode

Pmicrostructure. In comparison, the macroscopic approaches, like
Finite Difference Method, Finite Element Method and Finite Volume
Method, etc. make the continuum framework [22]. With much lower
computational cost and generally acceptable prediction of the over-
all performance, the macroscopic models constitute one of the wid-
est efforts for fundamental and engineering-oriented representation
of SOFC and system [23,24]. Focused on the analysis of the V-I per-
formance of cells, steady-state operation, transient behaviors and
process control of the system, we only survey here the macroscopic
models in different dimensions. Again, to be focused on the electro-
chemistry and transport, other topics in macro scale, e.g. the study
on thermal stress in SOFC [25], are not included in this paper.

P2.2.1. Mass and heat transfer

PIn terms of the macroscopic modeling, conservative continuum
theories are used to describe interactions in the chemically reacting
flow system [26,27]. The physics include mass, momentum, energy,
in which the kinetics of chemical/electrochemical reactions are
included as the terms of mass/heat transfer source or sink. Different
from the general reacting flow system, mass and heat transfer in fuel
cells are coupled to charge transfer, which is generally governed by
the Ohm's law.

P2.2.1.1. Multi-component mass transfer.
PThe Fickian model (FM), Ste-
fan(cid:1)Maxwell model (SMM) and dusty gas model (DGM) have been
extensively studied in multi-component gas transport through
porous media [26,28(cid:1)31]. Up to now, following the technologies of
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and numerical heat transfer
[32], the most frequently used approach is based on the convective-
diffusion framework. As the simplest model, the Fick's law is suitable
for molecular diffusion in binary system or dilute multi-component
system, and can be extended to account for Knudsen diffusion by
correcting the diffusion coefficient as [33]

(cid:1)
Di;Fick 1⁄4 1= 1=Di;m=DiK
ð1Þ
where Di,K is the Knudsen diffusion coefficient, Di,m is the mixture
continuum diffusivity and can be estimated by Wilke formula [29]

PFor binary system, D1,m D D2,m D D12, and Eq. (1) becomes the
Bosanquet formula. Considering the convection flux due to the pres-
sure gradient, it results in the extended Fickian model by adding the
Darcy flow to the diffusional transport [33]. The generalized FM
(GFM),
invented by Curtiss and Bird [34], further provides the
explicit flux terms driven by concentration, pressure and tempera-
ture gradients. The commercial package, COMSOL, uses the GFM as
the built-in model for multi-component mass transport between
concentrated species [35].

PCompared to the GFM, in which the Onsager reciprocal relation-
ship generally does not hold in the diffusivity pairs [26,29,30], the
Maxwell-Stefan approach seems to provide a more robust solution.
With an implicit flux-force formulation [29], the SMM describes the
balance between the driving forces (i.e. chemical or electrochemical
potential gradient) and frictional resistance between components.
The DGM evolves from the SMM, as that the porous solid wall is con-
sidered as an additional “dust” species (‘M’) with large molecular
weight, constrained to be stationary by external clamping forces
[28,29]. As a result, the DGM has the ability to indicate the pore-gas
interaction (i.e. Knudsen diffusion) and its influence on pressure gra-
dient, and therefore the DGM has been one of the most recognized
solutions to represent combined viscous flow, bulk diffusion, and
Knudsen diffusion. Sometimes, the extended SMM (eSMM), by cor-
recting the binary diffusivity as Eq. (3), can also be used to account
for the Knudsen diffusion in the standard SMM framework [36].

approaches of
FM, SMM and DGM were generally used
[21,22,37(cid:1)39], and some minor used the Binary friction model
(BFM) [40(cid:1)42]. A proper model of mass transfer is important for
accurate predicting the profile of the gas species, the concentration
overpotential and also the activation overpotential with dependency
on species’ concentrations at the active site. Suwanwarangkul et al.
[43] made a comparison between the FM, SMM, and the DGM in
terms of predictive capability of the concentration overpotential for
an anode-supported PSOFC anode.

Psame time, calculated the flux ratio between different fuel species in
P
1⁄4 0Þ, i.e. flux is inversely
the DGM by the Graham's law (
proportional to the square-root of the species molecular weights
(N1=N2 1⁄4 (cid:1)
). For the binary-fuel cases (H2 ¡ H2O and
CO ¡ CO2 systems), the equimolar-counter transport holds physi-
cally due to the stoichiometries of the electrochemical reactions.
Therefore, when accounting for the Knudsen diffusion, a pressure
gradient inside the anode establishes. Tseronis et al [44] carried out
a 2D calculation, but attributed the inaccuracy of simulation by
Suwanwarangkul et al. [43] to their 1D calculation. With the view-
point of the flux-ratio approaches and pressure gradient, Bao et al.
[45] implemented a comprehensive survey among FM, SMM, and
DGM. Validated by the experiments by Yakabe et al. [46], the DGM
combined with the ‘Stoich’ flux-ratio approach, i.e. dictating the spe-
cies flux with its stoichiometry of the electrochemical reaction, won
the best performance. And the ‘Graham’ flux-ratio approach (i.e. dic-
tating the species flux with the Graham's law) in all models underes-
timated the concentration overpotential, especially when the
species molecular weights are much different. The eSMM model can
be an alternative to the DGM, although it somehow overestimates
the pore-gas interaction. The SMM and the FM are useful in the cases
of high reactant concentration, low operating current density and
low pore-gas interaction (large pore size). Bao et al. [47] further
extended the DGM combined with the ‘Stoich’ flux-ratio approach to
the H2 ¡ H2O ¡ CO ¡ CO2 fuel mixture, where the ‘Graham’ law fails
to determine the fluxes of each species when both the H2 and CO
current output are accounted for.

the
Navier-Stokes (NS) equation and Darcy's law are generally used for
flow in the channel and the porous electrode, respectively. Such an
approach requires data exchange between velocity and pressure
profiles of the channel flow and the porous flow at the channel/elec-
trode interface. To avoid this, the general Navier-Stokes equation or
the Brinkman equation provides an alternative and simple approach
to make a uniform description of channel/porous flow

where r, p, m and u are the density, pressure, dynamic viscosity and
velocity vector of the fluid, respectively, I* is the unit tensor, ep and
B0 are the porosity and permeability of the porous media, respec-
tively. For channel flow, ep D 1 and B0 ! 1, the last item in Eq. (4)
vanishes and Eq. (4) reduces to the standard NS equation. For porous
flow, the last item in Eq. (4) dominates the inertial item and stress
items and then Eq. (4) reduces to Darcy's law. Such an approach has
also been widely used in modeling of polymer electrolyte membrane
fuel cell (PEMFC) [48].

PThe transport properties of materials, reaction kinetics, and the
characteristics of parameters distribution are all
temperature-
dependent. There are various heat effects in SOFCs, including con-
vective heat transfer at the solid/gas interfaces, conductive and radi-
ant heat transfer within and between solid elements, the heat of
chemical reactions, heat generation due to irreversibility in electro-
chemical reactions at TPBs, etc. [37,38]. Especially, radiant heat
transfer plays a significant role in the operation of high-temperature
reactors like SOFC. Hajimolana et al. [38] summarized the empirical
expressions of Nusselt number (Nu) correlations for calculation of
the convective heat transfer coefficient. It is commonly thought that,
in the context of SOFC modeling, Gienelinski's equation is the most
accurate expression, which correlates Nu with the friction factor (f),
Reynolds number (Re), Prantl number of fluid (Pr) and geometry of
the duct. Yuan et al. [49] numerically studied the fully developed

Plaminar heat and mass transfer in rectangular and trapezoidal fuel
cell ducts, in which the electrochemical interface was replaced with
a porous wall with uniform injection/suction mass. Compared to the
transport through a duct with all impermeable walls, the simulation
results showed that the mass injection increase f and decreases Nu,
and vice versa for the mass suction. It had also been verified that the
injection/suction mass rate, the aspect ratio of width to height, and
the base angle of the duct have significant effects on thermal-
hydraulic parameters (f and Nu). However, for a typical SOFC opera-
tion, the mass-transfer Reynolds number (Rem) is small enough for
safe usage of the classical hydraulic/thermal correlations.

PIn some cases, some reasonable assumptions are taken to sim-
plify the models, e.g. gas velocity in the flow channel is considered
to be constant, only the along-the-channel temperature gradient is
taken into account to make a quasi-2D simulation, electrochemical
oxidation of fuel species is considered that only occurs at the anode/
electrolyte layer (A/E) interface (i.e. interface-type modeling), rather
than in the anode everywhere, etc.

PAs an example, Fig. 5 shows a distributed-parameter, interface-
type model for mass and heat transfer along the flow channel. In the
following equations, a uniform description is used for both the
PSOFC and TSOFC [19]. More importantly, the detailed radiation
model (see the Section 2.2.1.2 for details) was also included.

P2.2.1.3. Internal reforming.
PThe hydrocarbon fuel, such as methane
and biofuel, etc., can be used as reactants in a SOFC by direct internal
reforming (DIR) and indirect internal reforming (IIR) [1]. The IR-
SOFC operation needs less steam by utilizing the product water
vapor from electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen, also the strong
endothermic effect of the steam reforming process decreases the
requirement of surplus air for cell cooling. As a result, it would
improve the system efficiency and meanwhile require more elabo-
rate heat management [50].

PA lot of literature has been involved in modeling of the internal
reforming [22,38]. The simplest approach is to assume thermody-
namic equilibrium of the methane steam reforming reaction (MSRR)
and the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) [19,51(cid:1)56]. There are

Pgenerally two approaches for global kinetics, i.e. volume- and area-
specific rate corresponding to reactions inside the catalyst pellets or
at the surface of catalysts, respectively. Table 1 lists some represen-
tative expressions of the global rates of MSRR and WGSR.

PThe Arrhenius form was commonly used for the global kinetics,
some of them only took the forward rate of the reactions into
account. Seen the following equation, the global kinetics of the
MSRR was normally correlated to the temperature and partial pres-
sure of methane and steam

PIn this formulation, different sets of parameters were put for-
ward. In addition to many different values of the activation energy
(Ea) and frequency factor (k0), a wide range of variation occurs in the
reaction order of H2O, which might be positive, zero or negative.
Achenbach and Riensche [57] presented the most widely used area-
specific reforming kinetics from their experiments on the surface of
a Ni-ZrO2 cermet. The results showed only a first-order reaction of
methane, with little effects of the steam concentration (n D 0).
Ahmed and Foger [58] investigated a Ni-YSZ anode (anode A) and a
modified Ni-YSZ anode (anode B). In their work, about a first-order
(m D 0.85(cid:1)1.4) and a slightly negative-order (n D ¡ 0.35» ¡ 0.8)
dependency with respect to methane and steam were found, respec-
tively, and the activation energy (95(cid:1)208 kj mol¡1) and the pre-
exponent factor (2550(cid:1)8440 mol m¡2 s¡1) were found to be signifi-
cantly dependent on the electrode composite. Sanchez et al. [56]
studied the effect of reforming models, via a comparison between
the rates of Achenbach and Riensche [57] and Ahmed and Foger
[58]. Dicks et al. [59] studied the MSRR rate carried out in a typical
thin electrolyte-supported Ni/ZrO2 SOFC anode. Assuming Langmuir
adsorption isotherms, a non-Arrhenius form of reaction rate was fit-
ted. Within the range of temperature (700(cid:1)1000 °C) and the partial
pressure of CH4 (2(cid:1)40 kPa), H2 (10(cid:1)70 kPa) and steam (10(cid:1)70 kPa),

Note: rref and rshift mean the volume-specific rates with unit [mol m¡3 s¡1], rref,cat with unit [mol s¡1 gcat¡1] means the volume-specific rate related to the catalyst density, Rref
and Rshift mean the area-specific rates with unit [mol m¡2 s¡1], pressure is in unit [bar], temperature is in [K].

Pthe reaction rate was first order in methane with a weak positive
effect of hydrogen, and a stronger negative effect of steam.

PThe volume-specific rate was also normally expressed with
respect to the catalyst density, with the unit [mol gcat¡1 s¡1]. Nagata
et al. [60] proposed the reforming rate similar to those of Achenbach
and Riensche [57], Ahmed and Foger [58], with the first-order
dependence on the partial pressure of CH4, however, the zero-order
dependence on the concentration of steam was found in their study.
Belyaev et al. [61] got the similar results and correlated the reform-
ing rate to the molar fraction of CH4, as the experiments were stud-
ied at atmospheric pressure.

PHou and Huges [62] studied the MSRR and WGSR over a commer-
cial Ni-Al2O3 catalyst (ICI 57(cid:1)4) in an integral reactor under condi-
tions of no diffusion limitation. Experiments were implemented
with the steam/methane ratio of 4»7. They put forward the mecha-
nism that both methane and steam are adsorbed on the catalyst
with dissociation, with the methane dissociated into CH2 and H2
or adsorbed H, and the suggestion that surface reactions between
adsorbed species are rate controlling. Seen Table 1, derived by using
the Langmuir(cid:1)Hinshelwood(cid:1)Hougen(cid:1)Watson (LH(cid:1)(cid:1)HW) approach
and Freundlich's adsorption concept, the intrinsic rate equation also
showed the negative order of steam. Lee and Huber [63] carried out
the catalytic reforming experiments in a continuous stirred tank
reactor. Two different Ni/ZrO2 cermets, with 30% (N3Z3) or 40%
(N4Z4) zirconia content, were studied. Among the conditions with a
steam-to-methane ratio equal to or greater than 2 (2(cid:1)8), the

Preaction order obtained for steam was approximately ¡1.25 for both
cermets. After a review of the reforming rate on different Ni-based
catalysts, they summarized that the reaction order of steam (n) is
dominant by the H2O/CH4 ratio, i.e. n > 0 at the H2O/CH4 ratio much
less than 2, n D 0 as the H2O/CH4 ratio is close to 2, and n < 0 when
the H2O/CH4 ratio is much greater than 2. This contention supports
the experiments above-mentioned.

PRecknagle et al. [64] expressed the reforming kinetics with
respect to the partial pressure of CO2, rather than that of H2O. The
rate expression is the result of tests performed under atmospheric
conditions in a plug flow reactor (designed to minimize concentra-
tion and thermal gradients) using Ni-YSZ catalytic powder, using
steam-carbon ratio (cid:2) 2 and CH4: H2 (cid:2) 10 to prevent coking and deac-
tivation of the catalyst. The expression showed that there is a slight
hindering effect due to the presence of CO2, the conversion rate is
proportional to the methane concentration and not dependent on
the content of hydrogen and water. They also presented another
expression with both forward and backward reaction rates, which
drops the nearly zero CO2 dependence and gives the same rate as
the previous one at 800 °C and at both 1 and 5 atm.

PTo ensure thermodynamic consistency and an asymptotic
approach to an equilibrium state, some researchers derived the
global reforming kinetics with both the forward and the backward
rates. Haberman and Young [65] fitted the volume-specific kinetics
of the two catalyzed reactions from the data of Lehnert et al. [66]. In

Preformed gas mixture, Ni [67] compared the profiles of current den-
sity and species concentration along the main flow stream between
the different chemical models of Haberman and Young [65] and Leh-
nert et al. [66]. Klein et al. [68] gave an area-specific fitting of the
MSRR rate and a different volume-specific fitting of the WGSR rate,
based on the same data [66]. Nagel et al. [69] implemented a com-
parison between five different MSRR kinetics models, which were
found to have a considerable role in the temperature profile along
the cell channel length. Andersson et al. [70] applied a value of
7 £ 106 m2 m¡3 for the active area to volume ratio to make a vol-
ume-specific MSRR modeling based on the area-specific rate of Klein
et al. [68], meanwhile, the volume-specific WGS rate of Haberman
and Young [65] was used.

PModeling elementary heterogeneous chemistry is the other
approach. The most recognized heterogeneous chemical reaction
mechanism of methane reforming was developed by Hecht et al.

P[71]. The reaction mechanism, seen in Table 2, is constituted by 42
irreversible reactions among 6 gas-phase species and 12 additional
adsorbed species, of which the reaction rates are represented in the
Arrhenius-type formulation or as a sticking coefficient. Although the
reaction mechanism was written as pairs of irreversible reactions,
the reverse rate coefficients depend on the forward rate coefficients
and the thermodynamics. Because the reaction mechanism was
based on elementary molecular processes, it represents all the global
processes in an SOFC anode, including MSRR, WGSR, and surface-
carbon coverage. The elementary steps sound to make better funda-
mentals than the global kinetics does, for example, it could present
coking and NiO formation as it includes surface-adsorbed carbon C
(Ni) and oxygen on the surface up to one monolayer O(Ni). At the
same time, a set of the elementary steps means larger computational
cost (in seconds) than that in the global rate (in milliseconds), and
the difference will be significantly multiplied by the number of
numeric grids when they are embedded into a CFD code. On the
other hand, the elementary kinetics do not give the same overall
rate as the state-of-the-art global kinetics. Hofmann et al. [72] com-
pared the global reforming kinetics of Achenbach and Riensche (the
WGSR was assumed to be always at equilibrium) and the detailed
elementary heterogeneous mechanism of Hecht et al. [71] in their
quasi-2D PSOFC model. The results showed that the global model
has got much faster reforming rate than the elementary heteroge-
neous mechanism.

were generally considered non-interaction (transparent) with radia-
tive heat transfer, i.e. only radiation between solid surfaces were
taken into account. Compared to the models that only account for
conductive and convection heat transfer, the introduction of radia-
tive heat could promote the uniformity of temperature within the
cell [73]. A proper configuration of radiative heat transfer is also
helpful for improvement of thermal management in the SOFC sys-
tem. In the SWPC demo SOFC/GT hybrid system, the reforming heat
is provided by the radiant heat between the SOFC stack and the pre-
reformer [17,74,75]. Krist and Jewulski [76] implemented an initial
analysis underlying the design consisting of a kW-scale SOFC stack
and a radiant air preheater (RAP) module.

PA spectral radiative heat-transfer analysis is powerful but usually
computationally expensive. Murthy and Fedorov [77], Damm and
Fedorov [78] measured the refractive index and absorption coeffi-
cient of a polycrystalline YSZ electrolyte and analyzed the spectral
radiative heat transfer near the electrolyte/electrode interface in a
PSOFC. Governed by the radiative transfer equation (RTE), the spec-
tral radiative heat transfer was then incorporated into a global 3D
thermo-fluid model in a commercial CFD program, FLUENT. The dis-
crete ordinate (DO) method was used to solve the RTE. Alternately, a
simplified radiation model and further a one-dimensional heat
transfer approximation were also developed based on the Schuster-
Schwartzchild two-flux approximation, of which the accuracy was
comparable to that of the computationally expensive DO scheme
[79].

PThe most widely used approach for radiative heat transfer in
thermal models of SOFCs is the radiosity method, which provides a
simple computation with acceptable accuracy to get an overall eval-
uation among the whole bands (i.e. all the spectra) [80]. There are
generally two approaches, i.e. ‘simple’ and ‘detailed’ radiant model,
which are distinguished by the complexity of the evaluation of the
slice-to-slice configuration factor or view factor. The ‘simple’ radiant
model just accounts for the radiation exchange between two directly
opposed elements, i.e. the view factor between the two finite surfa-
ces or even differential elements is considered identical to that
between two infinite diffuse interchange surfaces. Most of the exist-
ing literature used the ‘simple’ radiant model due to its simplicity
[37,38,60,73,74,81(cid:1)83]. Some other researchers considered the

Pradiation exchange among several (normally three) adjacent finite
volumes, but the fixed view factors strongly rely on the number of
discrete grids [84,85].

PThe ‘detailed’ radiant model accounts for radiant heat exchange
between all the surfaces, and therefore are more accurate and more
computationally expensive than the ‘simple’ radiant model. In addi-
tion to more complex calculation of view factors, the ‘detailed’
brings a hybrid differential-integral calculation with respect to the
governing equations for the global thermal-fluid model (cf. Eqs. (7)
and (8)). More and more researchers paid attention to the ‘detailed’
radiative heat transfer. Calise et al. [86] presented a finite-volume
model of an IR-TSOFC, in which detailed radiative heat transfer
inside the AST and between the tube and the AST was calculated
based on the slice-to-slice view factors and corresponding radio-
sities. Contributing up to about 70% of the total heat transfer, the
radiative heat transfer was found to significantly influence the tem-
perature profile inside the cell. Sanchez et al. [87] compared the per-
formance between the ‘simple’ and ‘detailed’ radiant model with
respect to the axial cell temperature and pointed out that using a
‘simple’ model can result in a non-negligible underestimation of the
cell temperature. However, only the tubular geometry was consid-
ered and the configuration factors were not clear in their simulation.
Based on the Hottel's zone method, Brus et al. [88] modeled the radi-
ative heat transfer between the surfaces of fuel reformer and all
other components. The view factors were also calculated numeri-
cally. Zeng et al. [89] developed a global thermal-fluid model with
emphasis on quantifying the detailed radiative heat transfer process
in the fuel and air flow channels in PSOFC. Based on the commercial
CFD package, COMSOL, the view factors were calculated numerically.
The predicted results revealed that the radiative heat transfer should
not be neglected in SOFC simulation, and the radiation for co-flow
has more significant influence on the performance of SOFC than for
counter-flow operation.

PThe ‘detailed’ radiant model normally requires analytical formu-
las of the view factors. View factors in many configurations can be

Pfound in the catalog [90]. Especially, Kee et al. [91] developed a rela-
tively simple (compared to a full 3D simulation) model for rapid
evaluation of design configuration and operating conditions for
TSOFC stacks, in which the tube cells were assumed to be arranged
in hexagonal arrays in which the distance between tubes centers
form equilateral triangles. By using the crossed-string method, they
presented a new configuration-factor model to represent arrays of
staggered long cylinders. With the analytical formulas, it got an effi-
cient computation within a few seconds on a personal computer.
However, the global convection and radiation model and simulation
was not implemented.

PAiming at ‘detailed’ radiation in along-the-channel thermal
modeling, Bao et al. [92] developed analytical differential view-fac-
tor models for both planar and tubular configurations. As an exam-
ple, Fig. 6 shows the infinitesimal view factor (dFdPEN1,dCON2)
between a PEN element (dPEN1) and a CON element (dCON2) in
PSOFC, where X D Dch/Wch, Y D |Z2 (cid:1) Z1|, Z D z/Wch, and the infinitesi-
mal view factor (dFdPEN1,dPEN2,in) between two PEN elements (inte-
rior surface of the PEN tube) in the SWPC tubular configuration,
where D D rin/rAST,out, H D |Z2(cid:1)Z1|, Z D z/rAST,out, A D (D + 1)2 + H2,
B D (D(cid:1)1)2 + H2. The differential view factor model generally
requires an enough small size of differential elements to obtain an
accurate calculation. For a typical SOFC, the cell length is usually
much bigger than its characteristic size, i.e. L > > Dch and L > > Wch
in PSOFC and L > > rout in TSOFC. So a considerable number of grids
are required by distributed SOFC modeling, which leads to a large
amount of computation. On the other hand, there are numerical dis-
continuities in the differential view factors of planar configuration (i.
e. f1(X,Y) ! 1 when Y D 0 cf. Fig. 6). At these points, Bao et al. [92]
further developed the analytical finite-difference view-factor mod-
els, cf. Fig. 6. For a classical problem of convective and radiative heat
transfer for gas flow in a gray-wall tube, the finite-difference view-
factor model realized a very small relative error of the overall heat
balance by keeping a default grid number in all the range of length-
diameter ratio, and avoid extra complex mathematical derivations

Pof governing equations like what Siegel and Perlmutter did [93], who
transformed the integral equation of radiant energy balance into a
second-order differential equation. A full thermal-fluid computation
of SOFC was further implemented [19]. The results showed that the
‘detailed’ radiant model leads to a more uniform distribution of the
along-the-channel current density and cell temperature than that
from the ‘simple’ radiant model.

PIn addition, in some cases, the radiation heat transfer might not
play a big role. Using a 3D simulation code, Tanaka et al. [83] studied
the radiative heat transfer between the PSOFC stack surfaces without
the manifolds and the surrounding walls with the ambient tempera-
ture. In this configuration, the center of the stack is free from the
radiation. Therefore, the radiative heat transfer model did not show
an essential role in predicting the maximum cell temperature and
the cell voltage. However, the details of the radiation model were
not explained clearly in this study.

P2.2.2. Electrochemistry

PAs for the electrochemical reactions, both the elementary kinetics
and the global kinetics are used in macroscopic modeling of SOFC.
Researchers such as Kee and Deutschmann, to name just two, have
had a fair amount of success using microscopic models to describe
the electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbon mixtures. The elemen-
tary models provide a fundamental explanation on homogeneous
steps of gas-phase chemistry and surface dissociation and reactions
between adsorbed species, and heterogeneous steps including sur-
face reactions of ad/desorbing species and charge-transfer reactions
[94]. Meanwhile, they bring additional uncertainties (e.g. the path-
ways) and difficulties (e.g. the kinetic data) due to the complex
framework. Even if for the most studied H2 electrochemical oxida-
tion in Ni-YSZ anode, there have been some different mechanisms
including hydrogen spillover, oxygen spillover, interstitial hydrogen
charge transfer, and other combined mechanisms, etc. [94]. All these
mechanisms of H2 are still in dispute, and the elementary mecha-
nisms of CO and H2/CO are now in the initial stage [94]. Due to its
simplicity and feasibility in predicting the overall performance, the
Butler-Volmer (BV) equation (or its simplified version, e.g. Tafel
equation) or the general current-overpotential equation has been
the standard approach for the global kinetics.

PThere are gener-

ally two kinds of BV-type formulations in SOFC modeling, i.e. control
volume (CV-) type modeling and interface (INT-) type modeling
[19]. In the CV-type modeling, TPB is treated as a control volume
[95], in which electrochemical reactions (also chemical reactions, if
applicable) occur everywhere. Based on differential equations, the
CV-type modeling is able to provide the detail profiles of the elec-
tronic/ionic phase potential and ionic current [19,96(cid:1)101]. Based on

face, i.e. taking TPB as a non-dimensional interface area [95]. This
approach is called the INT-type modeling and has been widely used
in cell- and system-level modeling [19,43(cid:1)45,47,53,55,60,82,

PThe electrochemical kinetics acts as source/sink terms or bound-
ary conditions to affect the governing equations of momentum,
heat, and mass transport in different modeling framework. Table 3
lists some representative formulations and related data of BV-type
kinetics in CV-type, INT-type and charge-transfer-resistance (CTR)
approach. It is interesting that the parameter values could be quite
different among some expressions with the same (or similar) formu-
lation. Therein, the transfer coefficient (a and b) and reaction orders
(g i) play important roles. Iwata et al. [105] and Nagata et al. [60] pre-

Pand cathodic transfer coefficients and with ne D 3 in the overall elec-
trochemical reaction in the anode. Rather than the normally used pos-
itive reaction orders of all the gas species, in some expressions, the
product species (H2O) [97,111] and even the reactant species (H2)
[100] show a negative reaction order. Starting from the elementary
heterogeneous chemistry and electrochemistry, assuming the not
rate-limiting steps are in equilibrium, Zhu et al. [110] introduced
a nonlinear expression of the exchange current density in BV formula-
tion. For PEMFC modeling, based on the elementary mechanism by
Sha et al. [118], Bao and Bessler [119] also correlated the global kinet-
ics of electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in BV formula-
tion, in which the reaction order could be also negative. Tanner et al.
[120] and Virkar et al. [121] derived an expression for the effective
charge-transfer resistance (Reff
) with the grain size and porosity and
ct
microstructural parameters of the electrode.

PCorresponding to the CV- or INT-type models, volume- and area-
specific exchange current density is the most important variable in
the BV equation, respectively. In the state-of-the-art literature, they
were linearly linked by a simple geometric factor, i.e. j0 D fgeoi0,
where fgeo is a geometric factor with unit [m2 m¡3] and can be
physically interpreted as the specific area per effective volume
[19,70,98,99]. This is a kind of empirical approaches and lacking the-
oretical fundamental. For an identical process in physics, a suitable
relationship between these two exchange current densities is
required to get an equivalent performance, such as the overall over-
potential-current behavior, i.e. ht,V D ht,A. Under this rule, based on
the analytical approximation of charge transfer model in electrode,
Bao and Zhang [122] presented a novel nonlinear expression to
interconvert the two exchange current densities as

PAlong with different mathematical paths, the nonlinear relation-
ship was obtained equivalently in both Cartesian and polar coordi-
nates. In addition to the independence on geometric configuration
and the operating current density, accounting for j0 and i0 D f(T, pi,
g i) in Eqs. (11) and (16), respectively, the nonlinear correlation fur-
ther shows the effect of temperature and species partial pressure,
which cannot be explained by the empirical and linear one.

advantage of SOFCs. It is promising to use reformed gas and synthe-
sis gas (syngas) as fuel (with proper desulfurization) in SOFC, with-
out the problem of catalyst poisoning in a low-temperature fuel cell.
The hybrid-fuel (in presence of both H2 and CO) operation brings
more complicated phenomena over than the typical H2-fuel opera-
tion, including multi-component mass transfer, chemical reactions
(MSRR, WGSR, and possible side reactions) and especially H2/CO
electrochemical co-oxidation. The competitive electrochemical oxi-
dation between H2 and CO is one of the key topics and difficulties, in
both experiments and modeling studies.

PThe kinetics data for electrochemical oxidation of H2/CO fuel
mixture or even CO are still not rich in literature. The open circuit
voltage in the CO(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2 atmosphere was found comparable to that in
H2(cid:1)(cid:1)H2O fuel at the same molar fraction of H2(cid:1)(cid:1)H2O and CO(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2,
while the polarization in CO(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2 fuel is higher [123]. Matsuzaki
and Yasuda [124] prior investigated the behaviors of a Ni-YSZ cermet
anode in the H2(cid:1)(cid:1)H2O(cid:1)(cid:1)CO(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2 fuel system. In this work, the rates
of CO oxidation at 800 °C and 1000 °C were observed to be 1.9»2.3
and 2.3»3.1 times lower than that of H2, respectively, and the WGSR
was much faster than the electrochemical oxidation. O'Brien and
Giorgi [125] recently reported the similar results on NiCo-YSZ cer-
met anode. In the experiments of Weber et al. [126], a significant
degradation of cell performance was found when CO content is high
up to 90%. In the basis of investigation on current-voltage and
impedance characteristics, the work of Sasaki et al. [127] indicated

Pthe important role of water content on the thermodynamic equilib-
rium of H2/CO composition. A comprehensive investigation was
made, by Jiang and Virkar [128], on the effect of fuel composition on
gas transport and current-voltage characteristics of an anode-sup-
ported button cell. The electrochemical performance in CO(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2
fuel was claimed much worse than that in H2(cid:1)(cid:1)H2O fuel. However,
in the hybrid-fuel atmosphere, the CO-rich operation showed com-
parable performance to the H2-rich operation, and therefore the
WGSR was ensured to play an important role in converting CO into
H2. Further on patterned Ni-YSZ anodes in presence of H2, CO, and
H2/CO mixtures, the experiments by Sukeshini et al. [129] did not
show a significant increase of impedance as the H2 molar fraction
decreases to 25%, while the results showed the effect of water con-
tent on the open circuit voltage.

PA lot of modeling work on H2/CO hybrid-fuel operation have been
implemented in the context of the macroscopic framework. The
early-stage models assumed that there is only H2 current and CO
should be first converted into H2 by the WGSR before electrochemi-
cal oxidation [64,65,72,82,85,98,99,130]. Such treatment is unac-
ceptable for operation in presence of high CO concentration. Lehnert
et al. [66] first considered the CO current output but did not clarify
how to determine each of the H2 and CO current densities. Based on
the experiments by Matsuzaki and Yasuda [124], Suwanwarangkul
et al. [131,132], Andersson et al. [133,134], Aloui and Halouani [135],
Nagel et al. [109], Ni [67,136] and Bao et al. [19] assumed the pre-
exponential factor or the exchange current density in BV-type kinet-
ics of the CO oxidation reaction is several times (generally 2.5 times)
lower than that of H2. Besides that, the similar ratio of activation
resistance in Arrhenius's form was alternatively used for H2 and CO
polarization [19,116,137].

PA natural and simple idea for H2/CO electrochemical co-oxidation
is to directly extend the single-fuel electrochemistry to the hybrid-
fuel atmosphere. With this regard, the state-of-the-art models
assume the constant H2 and CO electrochemical kinetics, no
matter in single-fuel or hybrid-fuel operation. Take exchange

CO2 (cid:3)f ðhÞ, where f(h) is the current-
overpotential function in BV formulation, j0;H2;ref and j0,CO, ref are the
reference exchange current density of H2 and CO, which are constant
at a given temperature and gas composition. Based on the fixed ratio
=j0;CO;ref , this approach establishes a linear superposition
of j0;H2;ref
rate of single-fuel kinetics (H2 and CO) and has at least two weak-
nesses. (1) Firstly, the role of the WGSR kinetics (usually in equilib-
rium) and reaction orders (g) is not enough to represent the
significant effect of electric load and fuel composition on the com-
petitive oxidation between H2 and CO, which is usually nonlinear.
(2) Secondly, this approach can just make a case-by-case answer on
contribution share of H2 and CO in the total current, just from
numerical results (still with the first weakness) at variable current
densities and fuel compositions, lacking an analytical cognition.

PWith this regard, Bao et al. [138] have originally developed a non-
linear/adaptive superposition rate of H2-fuel and CO-fuel kinetics for
H2/CO electrochemistry. The approach still starts from a global BV-
type kinetics, i.e. j 1⁄4 1⁄2j0;H2 #H2 þ Gj0;CO#CO(cid:3)f ðhÞ, where the exchange
current density (j0) is function of temperature and gas composition,
#H2 and #CO 1⁄4 1(cid:1) #H2 is the weighting factor accounting for the H2/
CO composition, G is the key variable defined as ‘enhancement fac-
tor’ to describe the enhanced effect of hybrid-fuel atmosphere on
the electrochemical oxidation rate of CO relative to the single CO-
fuel rate.

PNote that G varies with the current density and fuel composition,
rather than a constant. When G D 1, it reduces to the linear-superpo-
sition rate. In cases of low CO concentration and high H2O concentra-
the value of G could be up to 102»104 and therefore
tion,
compensates the CO current contribution, that is why it was named
as ‘enhancement factor’. Under the action of WGSR in physics or of
the high value of G in numeric, the V-I characteristics in CO-rich or
H2-poor fuel mixture did not show a significant degradation com-
pared to the single H2-fuel performance, as that shown in Jiang's and
Virkar's experiments [128] and experiments by Sukeshini et al. [129].
If Gj0,CO is taken as the effective exchange current density of CO, such
algorithm first establishes a nonlinear and adaptive superposition
mechanism of single H2-fuel and CO-fuel electrochemistry for hybrid-
fuel operation, without introducing any additional parameters.

PWith the analytical expressions of v and G, this approach
answered explicitly and quantitatively at the first time about contri-
bution share of H2 and CO in the total electrochemical reaction rate
and how great the WGSR plays roles in. Bao et al. [47] further applied
the approach in area-specific modeling and found that the values of
v and G were significantly dependent on how to calculate the effec-
tive diffusivities, i.e. Wilke formula (Fickian) or Maxwell-Stefan
approaches, which illustrates the importance of a proper mass-
transfer model.

P2.2.2.3. Ohmic loss.
PThe ionic and electronic conductivity of cell
components (anode, cathode, electrolyte layer and also current col-
lection) is the most influential to the ohmic loss of an SOFC. There
have been a lot of development in materials of cell components, any-
way, YSZ has been most successfully employed for the electrolyte,
lanthanum manganite with properly doped rare earth and alkaline
elements (e.g. LSM, LSC, LSF, LSCF, etc.) is typically used for the cath-
ode, Ni/YSZ is the most used for the anode [1,2]. As the dominant fac-
tor, temperature affects the conductivities of component materials
in the Arrhenius formula

Bessette [140] published a similar set of temperature-dependent
data and equations excluding for the interconnector. Ahmed et al.
[141], Hirano et al. [142] and Nagata et al. [60] published their
respective data for the resistivity of the cell components at 1000 °C.
Li and Chyu [53] summarized these data and pointed out that the
expression of Ferguson et al. [139] leads to a higher predicted resis-
tivity for the anode and a lower prediction for the cathode compared
to the other expressions.

PCurrent collection pathway, which varies with the different
geometries of fuel cells, is another important factor affecting the
ohmic loss. In PSOFCs, oxide ions move perpendicularly across the
electrolyte layer, while the current flows in a network circuit, i.e.
move in the in-plane direction of the electrodes and then collects
through the channel walls or ribs, as modeled by Iwata et al. [105].
For simplification, most of PSOFC models in literature neglected the
current collection pathways due to ribs and considered only the per-
pendicular current flow through the PEN. In TSOFCs, in addition to
the current flow perpendicularly across the PEN (i.e. in the radial
direction), the current flows in the circumferential direction is
also significant. With this regard, various network-circuit models
current pathways
were developed to investigate
[55,60,73,142,143]. In this way, the potentials of the central grid
point (P) should be linked to its neighboring points (east (E), west
(W), north (N) and south (S)) and the corresponding grid P, by apply-
ing the Kirchhoff's loop rule [53]. Such an approach is also applicable
like the flattened tubular configuration
to other geometries,

PThe network-circuit model requires multi-dimensional calcula-
tions of detailed profiles of the potential and the overpotential. How-
ever, in some cases, to simplify the problem, we are more interested
in part of the parameter distribution. For example, in a tubular con-
figuration, the longitudinal current variation is much more signifi-
cant than the circumferential one. Based on the transmission-line
model by Nisancioglu [146], along-the-channel computations were
feasible to be implemented accounting for the ohmic loss due to the
circumferential current flow, without introducing the circumferen-
tial coordinate [19,60,85]. The general idea of the transmission-line
model is to describe the complex geometries by a set of five standard
cell sub-units, each of them has a characteristic current path pattern
and accordingly analytical formula for the equivalent resistance cal-
culation. For tubular geometry, the resistivity of unit length, RV is

P2.2.3. Surface diffusion

PCompetitive adsorption and surface diffusion play an important
role in heterogeneous chemical and electrochemical reactions. The
Matsuzaki's and Yasuda's experiment [124] showed that electro-
chemical oxidation rate was prevented to increase due to surface dif-
fusion and charge-transfer resistance when the temperature is
higher than 1000 °C. Surface diffusion has always played a great role
in the pathway in microscopic models, and might even be the rate-
determining step [94]. Vogler et al. [147] suggested the significance
of surface diffusion to the electrochemical behavior. Considered the
rate-limiting step to be Langmuir-type adsorptions of H with O,
Ihara et al. [148] investigated the dependence of V-I performance
and interfacial conductivity of Ni-YSZ cermet anode on the hydrogen
partial pressure. The detailed surface diffusion model investigated
by Williford and Chick [149] indicated that oxygen surface diffusion
on the metal particle is the rate-limiting step in the electro-catalytic
process. Anyhow, surface diffusion had been seldom included in the
state-of-the-art macroscopic models.

PPorosity (e) and tortuosity (t) or tortuosity factor are generally
used to characterize the porous electrode. In a fair amount of litera-
ture for macroscopic modeling, the porosity/tortuosity ratio was
taken as a fitting variable for correcting the effective diffusivity, i.e.
Di,eff D DiK with K D e/t or K D e/t2. In cases of high fuel utilization
and high electric load, to get the sharp slope of V-I characteristics in
the region of concentration overpotential, the value of K is normally
made quite lower than that at low current densities and high fuel
concentrations [101]. Corresponding to a typical value of e D 0.4, the
value of t could be fitted up to 14, which is normally within the
range of 2(cid:1)6 [150]. Alternatively, based on the Fickian model, Cayan
et al. [151] proposed an empirical expression to directly correlate
the effective diffusion coefficient with the limiting current density.
With a big success in macroscopic modeling, the variable porosity-
tortuosity-ratio approach (i.e. different value in different regions of
V-I performance) has obvious weaknesses. First, the tortuosity itself,
defined as a kind of geometric or kinematic parameter [22], should
be invariable with respect to different current density and fuel com-

Ppositions. More importantly, as a purely mathematical treatment,
this approach makes decreased effective diffusion coefficients in
critical conditions in numeric, while it actually builds an unex-
plained or virtual mass-transfer resistance in physics.

PThe virtual mass-transfer resistance is thought to come from sur-
face diffusion. In the fundamental of heterogeneous catalysis, the
phenomena of transport and chemical/electrochemical reaction in
porous media consist of multiple elementary steps of gas diffusion
and ab-/desorption, which undergo two sequential processes, as
modeled by Williford et al. [150]. First, reactant species diffuse from
the bulk site to the sites adjacent to TPB via the pore, correspond-
ingly the concentration gradient of species i is established from the
bulk concentration (ci,b) to the local intrinsic concentration (ci). In
this process, governed by the FM, SMM or DGM, the mass transport
consists of the molecular diffusion, Knudsen diffusion, and viscous
flow. Then, via relatively slow surface diffusion, reactant species
arrive at the TPBs and participate in the electrochemical reaction.
Correspondingly, the species concentration varies from ci to the real
reactive concentration at TPB (ci,TPB). Under normal conditions, there
are plenty of the active reaction where surface diffusion is negligible.
When current density and fuel utilization is high, the absorbed spe-
cies occupy most of the active reaction sites, as a result, surface dif-
fusion from the absorbed sites (via competitive absorption between
gaseous species) to TPB becomes dominant. Williford et al. [150]
proposed an analogous circuit model for the mass-transfer resistan-
ces in these two processes, which were considered parallel and seri-
ally connected at low or high current density, respectively.

PMost of the state-of-the-art macroscopic models have just taken
the first process into account, i.e. taking ci,TPB in Eq. (11) as ci without
considering surface diffusion. Based on Williford's work [150], Shi
et al. [152] and Bao et al. [101] introduced the series-connected dif-
fusion equivalent circuit, cf. Fig. 7, to represent the total mass-trans-
fer resistances. According to linear form of the Fick's law,

Fig. 7. Comparison between simulated syngas-fuel V-I curves by nonlinear and linear superposition rates of H2 and CO electrochemistry, and validated by Jiang's and Virkar's
experiments [129]. At the low inlet H2 concentration (20% H2 ¡ 80% CO), the linear superposition rate (i.e. G D 1) leads to an under-estimation of hybrid-fuel kinetics, as G > 1 gen-
erally holds, that is why we named it `enhancement factor’. Based on the serially-connected diffusion equivalent circuit model at high fuel utilization [102], the mechanism of
competitive absorption and surface diffusion was introduced to predict well in full range of operation and avoid the widely-used approach of correcting effective diffusivities
with variable porosity/tortuosity ratio. Reprinted from Bao [18].

PIt is noted that this approach introduced the mechanism of com-
petitive adsorption and surface diffusion in a compact way. Although
empirically somehow, it keeps the simple framework of macroscopic
modeling, instead of being involved in the elementary pathways. Val-
idated by the experiments of Jiang and Virkar [128], this approach
[101] predicted well the V-I characteristics of H2-fuel and CO-fuel
system, and also that of H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CO and H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2 hybrid fuel system,
accounting for both the H2/CO electrochemical co-oxidation and the
surface diffusion [153], as shown in Fig. 7. In all predictions, the
porosity-tortuosity ratio was kept fixed in the whole range of current
density and fuel compositions. The approach was further extended
and validated in the context of area-specific modeling [47].

P2.2.4. Electrochemical impedance spectra

PAs a powerful tool for the experimental and theoretical analysis,
providing more information than the conventional voltage-current
polarization, electrochemical
impedance spectra (EIS) has been
widely used in the measurement and analysis of dynamic character-
istics, verification of reaction mechanisms and characterization of
electrode microstructure, etc. for SOFC and its reverse operation, i.e.
solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) and also PEMFC, etc., as summa-
rized in the recent reviews [154(cid:1)158]. Especially, the elementary
kinetic models are normally coupled with the EIS analysis [94].

PThe conventional EIS calculation is based on equivalent circuit
model, i.e. analogizing the transport resistance and lead or lag char-
acteristics of general potential-flux pairs to combination of ideal
(resistor, inductor and capacitor, etc.) or non-ideal (constant phase
element (CPE), Warburg element, etc.) electric elements in series
and parallel, and then generating frequency response from the
electric circuit [159]. With the advantage of simplicity, the equiva-
lent-circuit model has achieved great success in SOFC study
[154,155,160(cid:1)164]. However, identifiability is the usual problem in
the equivalent-circuit fitting, i.e. identical impedance spectra may
be either obtained from the same equivalent circuit with different
parameters (the problem of structural global identifiability) or from
different circuit structures configured by the same elements (the
problem of structural model distinguishability). Based on physical
phenomena and governing equations, the state-of-the-art EIS calcu-
lation prevents from the uncertainty of identification. Moreover,
the physics-based impedance calculation is suitable for frequency

Presponse analysis with respect to arbitrary input/output variables,
not limited to voltage and current.

PSpringer et al. [165] opened a precedent to discuss the behaviors
of PEMFC using AC impedance spectroscopy based on a 1D mecha-
nistic model. Follow that, various impedance simulation was imple-
mented, of which the approaches normally include time-domain
sinusoidal excitation and frequency-response analyzer based on
Fourier transform techniques [166(cid:1)175], and some specific techni-
ques, like distribution of relaxation time (DRT) [163,176], etc. Due to
the high computational cost of sinusoidal excitation technique with
frequency-by-frequency computation, most of the physics-based EIS
calculation was based on 1D model accounting for the dominant
transport in the direction of PEN thickness. However, the impedance
spectra in segmented-in-series SOFC and large-sized, stackable cells
revealed the contributions of gas conversion impedance in the flow
field, of which the magnitude strongly depends on the gas flow rates
[177,178]. Schneider et al. [179] also suggested the presence of the
additional low-frequency impedance spectroscopy in PEMFC, which
is attributed to the along-the-channel profile of oxygen concentra-
tion. All these demonstrate the necessity of physics-based EIS calcu-
lation from multi-dimensional models. With this regard, Kulikovsky
[180] studied the impedance spectra of segmented cells, Mainka
et al. [181] discussed the Warburg diffusion impedance due to oxy-
gen depletion along the air channel. All these researchers, also Bar-
icci et al.
[183]
implemented a 2D EIS calculation and discussed the effects of along-
the-channel gas transport and temperature distribution on the
impedance spectra, in which the sinusoidal voltage perturbations at
different frequencies were imposed. However, the physics-based EIS
calculations starting from fully multi-dimensional models is still
limited by its high computation cost. Instead of the frequency-by-
frequency excitation technique with a sinusoidal signal, a step signal
can provide the complete frequency information at one excitation,
and therefore make a solution for rapid impedance modeling [184].

[182] used quasi-2D approach. Shi et al.

PHofman and Panopoulos [185] implemented a physics-based EIS
calculation, in which the multi-step heterogeneous reaction mecha-
nism of methane reforming was included. Spatial discretization was
applied for button-cell (1D), counterflow and coflow (2D) and cross-
flow (quasi-3D) geometries. Each of the considered main transport
processes can be attributed to an impedance arc. The mass transport
above the electrodes produces a low-frequency impedance arc called
Nernst impedance. Mass transport through the porous electrodes
(due to diffusion) causes the concentration impedance arc in mid-
dle-frequency range of the EIS. In case of hydrocarbon fuels, the
reforming reactions additionally affect this arc. The double-layer
charge transport induces a current at the TPB, which is related to the
activation overpotential and is responsible for the high-frequency
arc. However, general overlapping or merging of several arcs makes
it difficult to assess the underlying loss mechanisms in EIS measure-
ments. The sinusoidal excitation was used and the parametric analy-
sis of the SOFC inherent losses (overpotentials) was used to
deconvolute the impedance spectra.

PDue to plentiful dynamic behaviors, a Nyquist diagram of fuel cells
usually presents a plurality of impedance arc and overlap in a certain
frequency range. With much clearer physical view compared to the
equivalent-circuit-based EIS analysis, the physics-based EIS calcula-
tion has at the same time more difficulties to resolve the multi-arc
impedance plots. With this regard, Bao et al. [186] have invented the
methodology of ‘configuration of system dynamics (CSD)’ to resolve
the impedance plot from physics-based EIS simulation. The idea of
CSD approach is to subsequently or flexibly switch on or off the indi-
vidual transient terms in the governing equations: the charge-transfer
dynamics due to the double-layer capacity (Cdl@h/@t), the mass-trans-
fer dynamics and flow dynamics in gas channels and gas diffusion
layers (GDLs) (@u/@t, @r/@t and @vi/@t), etc. Based on the step excita-
tion/Fourier transform algorithm [184] and the CSD approach, Bao

Pet al. [186] implemented an EIS simulation based on a fully 2D model
for a PEMFC with long gas flow channel [119], in which the main
transient behaviors, including the water-transport dynamics in PEM,
were captured. At different cell voltage, different impedance spectra
reveal. As shown in Fig. 8, in case of medium current density (region
of ohmic overpotential), the Nyquist plot exhibits a three-arc feature:
a high-frequency charge-transfer (in a double layer) arc, a medium-
frequency transport arc (mass transfer and flow along the channel
and GDL), and a low-frequency water-transport (in PEM) arc. In case
of high current density (region of concentration overpotential), the
Nyquist plot has got a multi-arc feature again, anyway, the transport
arcs are larger than the charge-transfer arc, and the small water-
transport arc is shielded and not recognized. Further calculations in
some cases, not shown here, exhibited the inductive impedance arc
due to water transport, which demonstrates again the necessity of
physics-based calculations. Although qualitatively somehow, not lim-
ited to fuel cell analysis, the CSD approach is applicable for imped-
ance analysis of any electrochemical system, for system identification
and controller design for the transient system.

2.3. State-of-the-art SOFC models

PIn this part, with some representative literature, we introduce
the macroscopic SOFC models in a brief way, along with the

Pclassification in different dimensions. Meanwhile, both the steady-
state and transient models will be studied in each dimension. With
higher computational cost, the high-dimensional models (3D and
2D) have the ability to provide profiles of the species concentrations,
the local current densities, the solid/gaseous temperatures, the
ionic/electronic potentials and all kinds of the overpotentials, which
are of great significance for the safe and healthy operation of the
cell. As an approximation or simplified edition, the low-dimensional
models (0D and 1D) treat the cell or stack as a lumped plant, or a
black box, or a plant with only parameter distribution in one domi-
nant dimension. As a result, they are more widely used for system-
level analysis and optimization, and especially for control-oriented
study.

PUnder development, the transient models of SOFC are still not as
plenty as the steady-state models. Among the electrochemistry and
mass/heat transport, SOFCs show inherently multi-timescale behav-
iors. As listed in Table 4, summarized by Gemmen and Johnson
[187], the characteristic time scales in a PSOFC can be over nine
orders of magnitude. The complexity of the model depends on the
time scales of its interest. In order to study the transient characteris-
tics of SOFC, step changes of fuel/air flow and electric current or volt-
age were generally utilized.

multi-arc characteristic, i.e. the high-frequency arc (‘arc 1') due to charge transfer in the double layer, the arcs at medium and low frequency, details in (b) (‘arc 2A’ and ‘arc 2B’)
due to transport in GDL and along the gas flow channel, and the low-frequency arc (‘arc 3') resulting from water-transport in PEM. Impedance plots were resolved by the CSD
approach. Reprinted from Bao et al. [186] with the permission of Elsevier.

P2.3.1. 3D models

PWith the full spatial lengths, the 3D models are normally based
on the numerical technology of CFD simulation. There has been
some commercial CFD package, like FLUENT, COMSOL, CFD-ACE + ,
gPROMS, etc., which contains the fuel cell module. The effects of the
cell structures (basically planar and tubular) and the different flow
patterns (basically counter-, co- and cross-flow) were paid much
attention. For PSOFCs, it generally shows that the counter-flow oper-
ation has the advantage in current output, while the co-flow opera-
tion makes the most uniform temperature profile along the gas flow
channel. The transient models further consider the time-variant
behaviors of some crucial parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure,
concentration, and current density, etc.).

P2.3.1.1. Steady-state models.
PBessette et al. [188] presented pioneer-
ing a 3D mathematical model of a tubular SOFC. The complete elec-
trochemical and thermal factors were accounted for in a rigorous
manner, in which the methane reforming by Lee et al. [63] was
adopted and the detailed radiation based on accurate calculation of
view factors was implemented. Validated with the test data of SWPC
single cell, the model made a good agreement with electrochemical
and thermal results within 5%, and for most points, much better. Pre-
diction of power-voltage characteristics, irreversibilities, and pro-
files of temperature and current density were shown under various
operations.

PFerguson et al. [139] put forward earlier a 3D computation on dis-
tributions of the potential, temperature and species concentrations.
Based on the finite volume method, a local balance approach was
adopted in the mathematical model. In the aspect of energy balance,
ohmic heat, reaction heat of the WGSR and the reforming reaction,
and also the convective heat between solid/gas phases were taken
into account. However, this model did not consider the thermal radi-
ation, which normally has a significant effect on the operation of
high-temperature reactors. The results which were obtained with
the code were in good agreement with the IEA workshop for the H2-
fuel test case. The planar and tubular geometries and the cross-/co-/
counter-flow modes were analyzed and compared. The simulation

Pshowed that the counter-flow case has the best efficiency of genera-
tion. Furthermore, the code was applied to compute the optimal val-
ues of some given parameters, such as the rib width or the anode
thickness (using methane as fuel).
In addition, the comparison
between performances with the tubular, planar and cylinder geome-
tries was implemented.

PYakabe et al. [189] improved the model by Ferguson et al. [139]
by introducing the thermal radiation. Based on the commercial pack-
age, STAR-CD, the finite volume method was employed for the fun-
damental conservation laws of mass, energy, and charge. The
distributions of species concentrations, temperature, potential, and
current densities were correspondingly calculated. In addition, the
effects of cell size and thermal conductivity of the solid phase were
also investigated. Considering the strong endothermic reaction of
the internal reforming reaction, they also discussed the steep decre-
ment of gas temperature near the fuel inlet and the resulting big ten-
sile stresses on the solid phase. Yakabe and Sakurai [190] further
studied the electric current path in PSOFCs, which was treated pre-
cisely in calculating the cell performance. Simulation results showed
the presence of the diagonal electric currents inside the electrolyte
and the interconnector, and that the geometry of interconnector sig-
nificantly influences the cell performance.

PFor the modeling of PSOFC stacks, Recknagle et al. [191] demon-
strated an advanced simulation tool which combined CFD simulation
code, in the commercial package, STAR-CD, with a validated method
of electrochemistry calculation. The three flow patterns were exam-
ined in the cases of constant inflow rates and variable inflow tem-
peratures. The profiles of fuel species concentrations, temperature,
and local current densities were correspondingly investigated. The
radiant heat was neglected accounting for a large length/height ratio
of the gas flow channels, roughly 100:1 and 200:1 on the cathode
and anode side, respectively. With respect to a similar average cell
temperature and fuel utilization, the co-flow operation had got the
smallest temperature gradients. Wang et al. [192] obtained the simi-
lar results by using the commercial CFD code ANSYS-CFX.

PHaberman and Young [65] developed a 3D method for solving the
multi-component steady-state gas flow with chemical reaction in

Pthe porous support structure of an integrated-planar SOFC (IP-SOFC).
A novel feature of the method is its ability to compute the velocity
boundary layers at the edges of the porous structure, which is partic-
ularly important at the interface with the fuel channel. The results
highlighted the significance of the MSRR kinetics and the thermal
boundary conditions, both of which have a significant effect on the
flow field within the porous structure. After that, they further imple-
mented a detailed simulation of an IP-SOFC stack [193]. The geome-
try of the stack was considered to be adequately described by using
a computational domain with just two modules, where the physical
and chemical processes of flow, heat transfer and chemical/electro-
chemical reactions occur. The results showed that temperature was
well distributed within each fuel channel and increased steadily in
the air flow direction.

PYuan et al. [194] implemented a 3D simulation and analysis on
transport phenomena in an anode duct of intermediate temperature
SOFC. Mass transfer relevant to the interfacial gas permeation and
electrochemical reaction, and the combined thermal boundary con-
ditions on solid walls were applied. Three characteristic ratios, i.e.
the hydraulic diameter ratio Dhr (ratio of diameter of the porous
layer to diameter of the flow duct), the permeation rate ratio PRr
(ratio of the pressure gradient at the entrance to the permeation
resistance), the permeation length ratio PLr (ratio of width of the
porous layer to width of the flow duct), were discussed and then gas
flow and heat transfer were investigated in dimensionless forms, i.e.
associated with the terms of friction factors (f) and Nusselt numbers
(Nu). For anode-supported configuration, the properties of the
porous layer and the duct geometry were revealed to have a signifi-
cant influence on both gas flow and heat transfer. Via proper adjust-
ment of the duct configuration and/or flow parameters, a uniform
fRe (Re is the Reynolds number) in the main flow direction can be
found to be achieved. However, any radiation effects had not been
included in this study.

PLu et al. [145] investigated the mass/heat transfer and gas flow in
a flat-tube high power density (HPD) SOFC with a 3D steady-state
model. For the new design developed by SWPC, the electric circuit
network of a discretized cell stack was applied to study the current
path. The flow fields, temperature and species concentration of the
fuel and air stream were strongly coupled inside and outside the var-
ious chambers. With hydrogen as fuel, the variation of the gas flow
fields, temperature, and species concentration was studied with
respect to the current output

PBased on a 3D thermo-fluid-electrochemical model, Ji et al. [195]
evaluated the mass/heat transfer and electrochemical behaviors for
a thin-film miniaturized SOFC, which has got a better performance
at lower operating temperature compared to conventional electro-
lyte-supported SOFC. A parametric study was carried out to investi-
gate the effects of the operating temperature and rib width on the
profiles of local temperature, current density, overpotential, and
species concentration. It was found that decrement of the flow chan-
nel height can reduce the average cell temperature and improve the
cell efficiency, because of both a shorter current path and a higher
heat/mass transfer coefficient at the solid/gaseous interface. The
decrement of channel/rib width ratio was found to be a feasible way
to reduce the ohmic overpotential and therefore improve the cell
performance.

PNikooyeh et al. [196] implemented a 3D investigation on the
thermal and electrochemical behaviors of an anode-supported DIR-
PSOFC using methane as fuel. The profiles of temperature and spe-
cies concentration along the gas channels and through the PEN
structure were studied. The most impressionable region for carbon
deposit and thermal stress was identified with respect to the
CH4/H2O ratio and temperature gradients, respectively, and the
result indicated that the identification of the temperature gradients
within the cross section of the cell is only possible with the use of a
3D model. It was predicted that there are substantial temperature

Pgradients both along the cell length (up to 16 K cm¡1) and within the
cross-section of the cell (up to 35 K cm¡1), specifically at the inlet to
the cell. Furthermore, the technology of anode gas recycling, which
changes the composition of the inlet fuel, was discussed to reduce
the large temperature gradients. The anode recycling rate was opti-
mized to be about 60% under the studied conditions, with an objec-
tive to get a significant decrement of the temperature gradients and
a lower possibility for the carbon deposit at the anode, without cut-
ting down the operating current density.

PIn the 3D multi-physics model of Liu et al. [197], electronic and
ionic conduction, mass transport and electrochemical reactions on
the TPBs were considered. The simulation was implemented in the
FEM-based software package COMSOL MULTIPHSICS. In order to
improve the computation efficiency in the 3D numerical models and
alleviate the effect of thin film in the meshing step, a mathematically
equivalent method was presented to scale the ionic conductivity
related to the variable electrolyte layer thickness, and the model
was also used to find the optimal rib widths for given channel-rib
pitch widths. Also in COMSOL MULTIPHSICS, Akhtar et al. [198]
implemented a 3D simulation for a single-chamber SOFC, in which
the hydrodynamic and electrochemical effects with respect to the
variable porosity of the electrodes were predicted.

PA 3D CFD model was presented by Autissier et al. [199] in the
commercial package, FLUENT, to optimize the geometry of repeat
elements in a whole stack, based on predicting fields of the gas flow,
temperature, current density and species concentration. Radiant
heat transfer between inner surfaces was taken into account. Dani-
lov and Tade [200] developed a 3D FLUENT model of a PSOFC with
internal reforming for anode flow field design. The model reflected
the influence of various factors on fuel cell performance including
flow field design and kinetics of chemical and electrochemical reac-
tions. The boundary conditions for charge balance with the electro-
chemical reaction of both hydrogen and carbon monoxide oxidation
were also included. As an application, the new flow field ‘N2’ was
designed to intensify transfer processes coupled with the chemical
and electrochemical reactions, and the maldistribution for different
flow designs was evaluated. Also by using the FLUENT code, Qu et al.
[201] developed a 3D model for an anode-supported PSOFC with
corrugated bipolar plates serving as the gas channels and the current
collector. The add-on FLUENT SOFC module was implemented for
modeling the electrochemical reactions, loss mechanisms associated
with the electric parameters. The spatial profiles of flow velocity,
pressure, temperature and gaseous concentrations along the gas
channels and through the cell structure were investigated. The rele-
vant variables such as the local potential, local current density, and
fuel utilization were calculated and studied. The modeling results
indicated that, for the proposed SOFC design, reasonably uniform
distributions of current density over the active cell area can be
achieved. It was also pointed out that the design could be further
improved by decreasing the cross section of side channels outside
the active region of the cathode.

PRecently, Peksen et al. [202] presented a 3D model with CFD-FEM
coupled technologies for thermofluid and thermomechanical analy-
sis of a 36-layer planar unit cell layers composing of interconnector
plate, frame, wire mesh, cell and glass-ceramic sealants. The nonlin-
ear elastoplastic behavior of the interconnector plate, as well as the
mal flow behavior that may result in thermomechanical differences
within the stack, were accounted for in the coupled computational
mechanics study. The results showed that the sealant is subjected to
high tensile stress as they are bonded together, and therefore, the
sealant is susceptible to failure at locations guided by the steel
behavior. Schluclzner et al. [203,204] implemented experimental
and 3D numerical investigation of carbon deposition on an indus-
trial-sized SOFC using diesel reformat as fuel, for mobile applications
such as Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). The surface-to-surface and the
Discrete Ordinates (DO) model were used for radiation modeling.

PDifferent global kinetics and the detailed heterogeneous chemical
reaction mechanism of methane reforming by Hecht et al. [71] were
employed and compared. It was shown that radiative heat transfer
within the flow channels homogenizes the temperature distribution.
The steady-state investigations indicated that elementary carbon is
permanently adsorbed onto the catalytic active sites in the anode,
and the inlet region of the porous anodic structure is especially sus-
ceptible to coking.

P2.3.1.2. Transient models.
PAchenbach et al. [115] proposed a 3D,
time-dependent model of a planar stack, considering the internal
reforming of methane and the anode gas recycling. The simulation
was then implemented to analyze the effect of cross-/co-/
counter-flow patterns, and in particular to obtain the distribution
of the gas (e.g. CH4, H2, H2O, etc.) composition, the solid temper-
ature and the current density across the cell. The effects of radia-
tion from the outer stack surface to the surroundings were also
considered. It was found that recycling of the anode gas provides
to supply the cell with steam also contributed to a higher plant
efficiency and more uniform current density distribution and
that the response time for load changes was strongly coupled
with the solid-temperature.

PA 3D dynamic model for the SOFC system was developed by Pet-
ruzzi et al. [137]. Based on MATLAB programming, the code is able to
provide the time-dependent profiles of temperatures, currents,
gases concentrations, and electrical/thermal power intensity. The
thermo-electrochemical behaviors during the transient processes
were investigated, including from heating-up to about 600 °C, from
start-up to normal operation at the design cell temperature, the pro-
cess of energy delivering and cooling down. The heating-up and
start-up simulation could give the response time, check the steepest
temperature gradients in solid phases and aid to determine the pre-
operating strategy. The energy-delivering simulation allowed to
define the guidelines in system-controlling and the cooling-down
simulation gave advises about insulation designing. The results
showed that air mass flow seemed to be the most appropriate regu-
lating parameter for managing the heating, starting and steady-state
operations.

PMenon et al. [205] developed a novel numerical algorithm for 3D/
2D SOFCs models, in which only representative cells based on the
clustering algorithm, rather than every individual cell in the stack,
were chosen for detailed simulation. Two different
transient
responses to load variation, i.e. constant voltage and constant cur-
rent, were implemented to get the stack dynamics. Furthermore, the
effect of boundary conditions and stack materials on response time
It was
and internal temperature distribution was investigated.
observed that both the load-change modes excited almost the same
response between the two steady states when the adiabatic/Neu-
mann boundary conditions were adopted.

PA 3D CFD model had been developed and tested by Al-Masri and
Peksen et al. [206] to simulate the transient heating-up process of a
full-scale APU PSOFC short stack. A significant advantage of the pre-
sented model was that the obtained temperature field could be
transferred to a solid finite-element mesh, which could be used for a
thermo-mechanically induced stress analysis. Hotspots and high
gradients were found to arise at the gas inlet region in the first stage
of the heating-up process, while higher gradients appeared in the
outlet area at the end stage of the heating-up process. Moreover, the
model was applicable to optimization analysis of the heating-up pro-
cess. Peksen [207] developed a CFD/FEM coupled model to elucidate
a fully 3D thermomechanical analysis of the PSOFC short stack over
a whole thermal cycle. The interaction between typical stack compo-
nents i.e., cell component, wire-mesh, metal frame, interconnector
plates and sealant materials have been considered. The study gives
an insight into the transient thermal behavior of a full-scale fuel
cell stack and its thermomechanical response, determining the

Pmechanisms that trigger the thermo-mechanically induced stress
during the heating-up, operation and shut-down stages, over time.

PHo [208] recently presented a 3D model-based simulation on
transient behaviors of an anode-supported SOFC, in which the elec-
trochemical reactions were assumed to take place within a layer
with finite thickness at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Step
changes in the output voltage and fuel concentration were employed
to evaluate the transient characteristics of SOFC. Transient profiles of
the current density, temperature and activation overpotential along
the cell length were investigated. An overshoot in the activation was
observed everywhere along the cell length in the case of voltage
decrease, and vice versa. Consistent with our natural understanding,
the response time for temperature variation was found to be the
largest among all the parameters.

P2.3.2. 2D models

PRelevant to 3D modeling, by neglecting the spatial properties in
one dimension, which has generally a minor role in the cell perfor-
mance, the 2D domain can represent the entire spatial dimensions
[95]. Similar to the 3D models, the 2D calculations also widely used
the CFD technology, meanwhile, the complex elementary reaction
kinetics are also included. For the steady-state models, besides the
distribution of key parameters, the model reduction techniques,
such as quasi-2D modeling, and sensitivity analysis are generally
contained. To the aspect of dynamic models, the transient cases
including load variation, shutdown, step changes of stack voltage
and fuel/air flow rates, as well as of the inlet temperatures are nor-
mally included.

P2.3.2.1. Steady-state models.
PCostamagna and Honegger [111] pro-
posed a 2D model as a function of the radial and axial coordinates of
a cylindrical stack integrated with an air preheater. Convective and
radiative heat transfer between the lateral surface of the stack and
the shell were taken into account. The predictions of both the tem-
perature distribution along the stack radius and the electrochemical
performance at low fuel utilization were validated by experiments
on a laboratory-scale stack. The results showed that the characteris-
tic curves are almost linear up to fuel utilization factor above 80%;
afterward, there is an increase of the slopes of the characteristic
curves due to an increase of the anodic polarization resistance. For
the electrochemical kinetics of H2, two alternative expressions of
the exchange current density, with positive or negative reaction
order of the steam vapor, were included in the model and compared.
The results for temperature distributions at high fuel utilization
were discussed further, indicating that the benefit of integration of
SOFC and an air preheater, i.e., an almost even distribution of solid
temperature on the cell plane, is still valid at high hydrogen utiliza-
tion factors.

PIwata et al. [105] developed a quasi-2D and quasi-3D program,
for co-/counter-flow and cross-flow PSOFC, respectively, considering
charge, mass and heat balances along the flow directions and per-
pendicular to the PEN. The along-the-channel profiles of tempera-
ture and current density were focused. A modified BV-type kinetics
with the asymmetrical anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients was
proposed for the electrochemistry. The equivalent network circuit
was used for modeling current path. The radiant heat transfer
between the furnace inner surface and the cell outer surface was
also considered as a boundary condition. With adiabatic boundary
conditions, the results indicated that the along-the-channel temper-
ature profile increases monotonically in the co-flow case and shows
a maximum close to the anode inlet in case of counterflow. The
effects of the view factor, gas recycling ratio and operating pressure
on the spatial profiles of current density and solid temperature were
studied. It was found that in co-/counter-flow case, by increasing the
recycling ratios of fuel and air, and by increasing the operating pres-
sure, the temperature increase is suppressed, however, the current

Pdensity profile cannot be flattened. Such an influence was found to
be more significant in a cross-flow cell.

PPalsson et al. [209] put forward a 2D steady-state cross-flow
stack model which was integrated into the AspenPlusۛ simulation
tool for SOFC/GT system analysis. Different from previous studies,
resistive cell losses, kinetics for reforming reaction, heat conduction
through the solid part of the cell stack were introduced in a detailed
way. At the same time, formulating constitutive laws were used for
the solid parts and the gas phase. However, two factors were
neglected in this study, one is radiation between gases and solid, the
other is pressure drop along the channels.

PLi and Chyu [55] proposed a 2D model to analyze the flow, mass/
heat transfer and chemical/electrochemical performance of a SWPC
TSOFC stack, in which the mass species and heat were assumed not
to exchange between one cell and its neighboring cells. Computa-
tions for were performed and compared with test data of three dif-
ferent TSOFCs available from publications by different researchers,
especially the test by Hirano et al. [142]. The model-predicted cell
voltage agrees with the experiments with an error of no more than
7.4% for all the test data. The profiles of temperature and species
concentration were also validated well by the test data. It was found
that the temperature hotspot locates near the closed end of the cell
tube when the operating current density is low, and shifts toward
the open end of the cell tube as the electric load increases, in that
case also the hotspot temperature decreases and there is a better
uniformity of temperature distribution along the gas channel.

PAckmann et al. [210] proposed a 2D mathematical model for the
mass transport in the substrate type PSOFCs. Coupled with the mass
transfer in the porous substrates, energy equations were integrated
into the model accounting for the electrochemical rate and MSRR
and WGSR kinetics. Based on the mean transport pore model
(MTPM), the 2D study allowed to optimize the substrates structure
for the best cell performance. Performed in the commercial CFD
package, FLUENT, simulation were presented and discussed for both
anode and cathode substrate type SOFC using partially pre-reformed
methane as fuel. In addition, the mathematical model was used for
sensitivity analysis and for optimization of cell performance by regu-
lating the structure parameters, which could have great influence on
manufacturing methods and conditions.

PThe model of Janardhanan and Deutschmann [211] employed the
heterogeneous chemical reaction mechanism of methane reforming
in the anode [71], modified BV formulation for the electrochemistry
and the DGM for the porous-media flow and diffusion. The flow field
was solved in the commercial package, FLUENT, and the source
terms & fluxes and electrochemistry model were programmed using
user-defined functions (UDF). Although the mechanism was in the
basis of elementary steps, it covered the global aspects of MSRR,
WGSR and Bouduard reactions. Although humidified CH4 was used
as fuel in an anode-supported IR-SOFC button cell, the study anyway
assumed only H2, without CO, as the electrochemically active spe-
cies. The simulation results showed that the polarization losses and
surface coverages of species at TPBs were significantly affected by
the inlet steam content.

PStiller et al. [85] proposed 2D steady-state models for methane-
fueled SOFC with planar and tubular geometries. Finite volume
method was used for modeling heat/mass transfer of the chemical
reactive flow. The transmission-line model was applied for calculat-
ing ohmic loss in the SWPC tubular geometry. For tubular configura-
tion, radiative heat transfer between the cell tube and the injector
tube was considered, and radiation heat was not included for planar
design. The cell model was then integrated into a SOFC/GT model to
investigate a baseline operation and a parameter study on the effects
of air flow rate, air inlet temperature, air pressure, and anode gas
recycling ratio.

PA 2D model was developed by Suwanwarangkul et al. [131] for a
syngas-fuel button cell. The model is isothermal without introducing

Pheat transfer to focus on momentum, mass/charge transport includ-
ing the kinetics of chemical/electrochemical reactions. A linear
superposition rate of the electrochemical kinetics of single fuels (H2
and CO) was proposed for the syngas-fuel global electrochemistry,
with the assumption that the pre-exponential factor of the CO elec-
trochemical oxidation in BV formulation is 40% of that of the hydro-
gen. However, only operations on relatively small operating current
density (< 0.1 A cm¡2) were simulated and validated. The effects of
fuel flow rate, N2 dilution, CO2 dilution and H2/CO composition were
investigated. Based on the thermodynamics of the Boudouard reac-
tion, the possibility of carbon form on the anode surface was pre-
dicted to determine a suitable range of conditions. Also using a 2D
model, Suwanwarangkul et al. [73] investigated the heat/mass trans-
fer in a SWPC TSOFC, in which a ‘simple’ radiation model and net-
work-circuit model for ohmic loss were included.

PSanchez et al. [212] presented a 2D axisymmetric model of chem-
ically reactive flow in a TSOFC with methane as fuel. A mixed
method was used to describe the transition between the two scenar-
ios, i.e. equilibrium and kinetics, of the reforming reactions, which
should be much dependent on fuel composition and temperature.
The simulated along-the-channel distributions of temperature and
species concentration indicated that equilibrium is reached close to
the cell entry and the MSRR is kinetically controlled afterward.
Besides the radiation between the grey walls describing by a ‘simple’
radiative model, the gas-solid radiation heat exchange in the anode
was also included. The simulation showed that the effect of the
anodic gas radiation on global performance is negligible under most
conditions, however, in some cases, the deviations might be up to
1%. The effects of the fuel utilization factor on voltage-current den-
sity curve, along-the-channel temperature, and Nernst voltage were
also investigated.

PShi et al. [152] developed a 2D isothermal model of an anode-
supported SOFC with button-cell geometry. The effective hydrogen
diffusivity was determined by using the electric analog circuit model
by Williford et al. [150], in which the bulk diffusion, Knudsen diffu-
sion and also surface diffusion were included. As a result, a good pre-
diction of the concentration overpotential was obtained in cases of
different H2/H2O composition, including operation region close to
diffusion limitation. The spatial profiles of current density and spe-
cies concentration were predicted and the effects of gas components,
anode thickness and cathode size on the cell performance were stud-
ied. Also by a 2D numerical approach, Shi et al. [213] studied the
behaviors of a composite multi-layer anode-supported button cell
(Ni-YSZ|Ni-ScSZ|ScSZ|LSM-ScSZ). The volume-specific electrochem-
istry was taken and the BV-type expression by Zhu et al. [110] was
used for the electrochemical kinetics in the cathode. After being cali-
brated by the experimental V-I characteristics, the model was then
validated well via comparing the predicted detached overpotential
in anode, cathode, and electrolyte, with the EIS measurements on a
symmetric cell.

POn the other hand, quasi-approximation allows much lower
computational cost and meanwhile good accuracy, when physics in
the two dimensions are weakly coupled. This condition is easy to
satisfy in an along-the-channel SOFC modeling, as that the size along
the channel length is usually much larger than that in other dimen-
sions. Li et al. [214] presented a quasi-2D model for a single unit of
TSOFC in practical operation, in which a network-circuit model was
introduced for the electric potential field, ohmic and thermodynamic
heat generation. A few simulation under conditions of different inlet
fuel and air flows with various thermal and composition were car-
ried out to test the proposed model. The detailed fields of the veloc-
ity, temperature, and concentration in the cell in addition to the
local electrochemical characteristics and the overall cell perfor-
mance were obtained. The predicted results were qualitatively and
quantitatively agreeable with experimentally known features of the
TSOFC, which showed that the quasi-2D approximation adopted in

Pthe model to effectively mitigate the computational cost can work
reasonably well. However, because of the simple treatment adopted
for the activation and concentration polarization, the cell terminal
voltage was overestimated in case of the low operating current
density.

PA quasi-2D model by Song et al. [74] was proposed for a SOFC
system composed of internal reformers and bundles of tubular cells.
Decoupled with the mass and heat transport, which was mainly
taken into account in the axial direction of the system, the electro-
chemical reactions were considered in the transversal direction. A
‘simple’ radiative heat transfer was introduced between the stack
and reformers. The along-the-channel temperature profile showed
that there is a peak near the cell entrance due to the exothermic
electrochemical reaction, and then the heat was released to provide
the heat request of reforming reaction in the internal reformer. Dif-
ferent flow directions of the fuel streams outside of TSOFCs showed
different patterns of the longitudinal cell temperatures. It was found
that the co-flow case will provide a high mean cell temperature,
compared with the counter-flow alternative. The results were fur-
ther applied in performance analysis of a TSOFC/MGT hybrid system.
PZhu et al. [110] presented a new computational framework for
modeling chemical reactive flow in an anode-supported SOFC using
H2, CO and methane fuel. The framework covers channel and
porous-media flow and transport, electrochemistry, as well as the
heterogeneous chemistry of methane reforming and partial oxida-
tion. The quasi-2D approach was used to make a 1D steady laminar
plug flow was considered in the gas channels by neglecting variation
of the gas composition in the direction of PEN thickness, along which
the DGM was used for multicomponent transport. The most impor-
tant highlight of the model is the capability to represent heteroge-
neous electrochemical and chemical kinetics in the form of
elementary steps. For H2 electrochemical oxidation and O2 electro-
chemical reduction, the charge-transfer chemistry was represented
with global kinetics in a modified Butler-Volmer setting that was
derived from elementary reactions but assuming a single rate-limit-
ing step and thermodynamic equilibrium of other steps. However,
the global kinetics of electrochemical oxidation of CO was not
included. Two examples, the first used button-cell experiments by
Jiang and Virkar [128] for parameters fitting, and then used in a one-
channel PSOFC with methane reforming, were served to demon-
strate the model capabilities.

PBased on a quasi-2D approach, Hofmann et al. [72] compared a
detailed model for elementary heterogeneous chemical kinetics of
reforming (HCR) with a global kinetic model (a simplified approach
where methane reforming was considered via a global kinetic rate
and the WGSR was assumed to be always in equilibrium) in the Ni-
YSZ anode of a high-temperature electrolyte-supported (ESC) PSOFC.
Although incorporated into SOFC model is much more complicated,
the HCR model allows to predict carbon coverage, and thus can be
used for carbon formation prediction calculations over Ni-catalyst
surfaces. With a much slower reforming rates, compared to the
global kinetic model, the HCR predicts a more uniform profile of the
solid temperature and a smaller power generation. The two models
result into predictions that differ greatly if high methane content
fuels are used. The cross-flow channel configuration was divided
into 10 (fuel channels) £ 10 (air channels) D 100 control volumes.
However, the radiation heat transfer between different solid compo-
nents (anode, cathode, electrolyte, and interconnector) was not
taken into account.

PLai et al. [215] recently presented a quasi-2D finite volume model
for simulating the steady-state co-flow and counter-flow behaviors
of PSOFC stacks, in which internal distributions of temperature, cur-
rent density, species concentration and voltage were available. To
get a balance between detailed physics and computational speed,
the model reduction techniques and model scalability, engineering
approximations and numerical procedures (coupling between

Pdifferent programming codes, two loop iterations (temperature field
and current), etc.) were used and discussed. For hybrid-fuel electro-
chemistry, only oxidation of hydrogen was taken into account. Simu-
lations for single cell benchmark, i.e. with humidified hydrogen fuel
or reforming fuel, and also simulations for multi-cell stack example,
i.e. with electrolyte- or anode-supported cells, were implemented
and compared. Be relative to baseline operation of a 96-cell stack,
the effect of reforming, measurement plates and flow maldistribu-
tion were discussed. The influence of reduced fuel/air flow and cell
electrochemical performance on the maximum current density and
cell temperatures was also demonstrated.

PXue et al. [216] proposed a transient
P2.3.2.2. Transient models.
model of a single TSOFC unit. In order to make the model tractable
while capturing the highly interactive dynamic behaviors of mass/
heat transport and effects of electrochemical reaction, a quasi-2D
analysis was implemented based on the changes along the gas flow
direction using the control volume method. In other words, while
the flow field within each channel was considered as 1D respec-
tively, the cross-sectional effects (e.g., heat transfer, species trans-
port, etc.) between the two concentric channels were fully taken
into account. An external step voltage change (step load voltage
experiencing sudden change from 0.6 to 0.5 V) was applied to ana-
lyze the systems overall transient response. The polarization perfor-
mance and output power density were determined by a variety of
interacting fuel cell state variables such as fuel/gas partial pressure
distribution, heat transfer between cell body and gases. After the
load voltage experiences sudden change, there were overshoots in
current contributions from sub-cells. Moreover, there are also
(delayed) overshoots in both hydrogen consumption and vapor
production.

PUsing Matlab/Simulink programming, Mueller et al. [217] devel-
oped a discretized physical model for the SWPC TSOFC stack and
other major components (external steam reformer and combustor),
in an integrated 25 kW SOFC system located at the University of Cali-
fornia, Irvine. Radiation between the cell tube and AST was included.
The quasi-2D approach was used for simplification. Each model of
the individual component was discretized in the principal flow
direction to resolve physical and chemical processes such as heat
transfer, chemical reaction, and ion flow as they occur in the cross-
wise direction. Within each discretized element or node, control vol-
ume method was used. Only the physicochemical processes with the
time scale of interest (> 10 ms) were considered in the transient
simulation. Typical open loop response of power, voltage, current,
fuel utilization, centric cell temperature and H2 outlet concentration
of fuel cell was investigated following a load resistance drop of 5%.
The characteristic dynamics of the cell voltage associated with varia-
tion of H2 concentration was shown to have a time scale on the order
of seconds, while the characteristic dynamics of temperature is on
the order of hours. The results reinforced the significance of keeping
fuel utilization during the transient process. The effect of the time
delay of mass flow controller or valve was also discussed.

PIn the Matlab environment, Li et al. [218] presented a 2D dynamic
model of a DIR-SOFC stack, in which the MSRR kinetics, electro-
chemical model and conversation laws of mass/heat transfer were
introduced. The transient profiles of local current density, tempera-
ture, gas composition were presented and discussed under the con-
dition of cross flow. Step changes in air flow rate (10% relative
decrease), fuel flow rate (15% relative increase) and stack voltage
(0.7(cid:1)0.8 V) were employed to investigate the dynamic performance
of the stack. The results revealed the different transient responses at
the five representative points. As an example, corresponding to the
step change of fuel flow rate, it took about 20,000 s for the mean
temperature to reach the stable value, however, the region near the
fuel and air inlet approaches the stable value rapidly, while others
take more time to stabilize. The transient behavior of the current

Pdensities was similar, and also the current density near the fuel and
air outlet showed an overshoot at first.

PXie and Xue [219] established an isothermal 2D transient model
for the anode-supported SOFC. The transient effects of both charge
migration and species transport in PEN assembly were taken into
account. Subjected to a step voltage decrease, the average current
density had a quick transient response and then followed by a slow
transient increase due to the slow nature of species diffusion effects
within porous electrodes. The transient response of the operating
current density was found to be sensitive to oxygen concentration
change at cathode/channel interface, whereas the current response
is slow when step change of hydrogen concentration is applied at
anode/channel interface.

PIn the COMSOL Multiphysics modeling framework, Serincan et al.
[220] developed a 2D, axisymmetric transient CFD model for an
intermediate temperature micro TSOFC. The internal current leak
which is a common problem with ceria-based electrolytes was also
included in the model. Transient responses of the current density,
average temperature in PEN were investigated when subjected to
single-step and sequentially three-step variation of cell voltage from
0.7 V to 0.4 V, as a result, the multiple input case induced a slower
response. An overshoot was observed in the transient response of
the current density due to the hybrid effect of rapid electrochemical
reaction (in order of 10 ms) and slower dynamics of the mass trans-
fer (in order of 3 ms). With a time-scale in the order of 20 s, the tran-
sient behaviors were predicted to be governed by the thermal
dynamics. Dynamic behavior as a result of a failure in fuel supply
was also investigated, and it was found that the external current
drops to zero in less than one second in the micro SOFC.

PRecently, Tseronis et al. [221] implemented a 2D parametric and
transient analysis of non-isothermal PSOFC. The DGM was employed
for mass transport and was explicitly written/constructed in the
COMSOL Multiphysics modeling framework. Besides the dynamics
of mass and heat transfer, the dynamics of electronic and ionic
charge density were also included. Corresponding to a step change
of the cell voltage, the transient response of the average current
shows an overshoot or undershoot, and its time constant is of the
order of a few hundred seconds, which is attributed mainly to the
slow dynamics of the energy transport phenomena. When subjected
to step change of fuel and air inlet temperatures, slower dynamic
behaviors of the average current density was induced, and more sig-
nificant overshoots or undershoots appeared, compared to the case
of the voltage step change.

P2.3.3. 1D models

PCorresponding to the two dominant coordinates, there are two
kinds of methods for the 1D modeling. In a first way, the dominant
coordinate is along the length direction of gas flow channel., Fuel/air
channels, anode/cathode, electrolyte and interconnects are treated
as a series of layers. This kind of models is mainly focused on gas
flow and heat transfer. In a second way, the available coordinate is
along the thickness direction of the PEN. Due to the small thickness,
this kind of models are generally focused on the electrochemistry
and mass/charge transfer in the PEN, i.e. are isothermal without
accounting for heat transfer.

P2.3.3.1. Steady-state models.
PLehnert et al. [66] developed a 1D (in
the thickness direction of the PEN) numerical simulation program to
describe the porous-media flow in the anode coupled with the
MSRR kinetic and the electrochemistry. A volume-specific kinetics,
with both the forward and backward rates of the MSRR and the
WGSR was fitted from the experimental study at different tempera-
tures. Simulations were performed to study the methane conversion
rate with baseline (experimentally determined) and parametric
analysis of structural properties of the anode. A decrement of 12.24%
of the methane conversion rate was harvested with respect to a

Preduction of 26.28% of the porosity-tortuosity ratio. The mean pore
radii also affect the methane conversion rate, although it does not
play roles as most as the porosity-tortuosity ratio. The electrochemi-
cal oxidation of CO was mentioned, however, not explained clearly.

PNagata et al. [60] proposed a special design of a tubular internal
reformer with adjusted catalyst density to avoid the inhomogeneous
temperature distribution due to the strong endothermic MSRR at
the entrance of the internal reformer inserted into the TSOFC stack.
The output characteristics of this configuration were simulated using
a 1D mathematical model along the flow direction. An Arrhenius-
form volume-specific kinetics, with only forward rate, of the reform-
ing reaction, was applied. The ‘simple’ radiant model to indicate the
radiosity between the neighboring control volumes. A modified BV-
type relationship with the asymmetrical anodic and cathodic trans-
fer coefficients was used for the overall electrochemical kinetics in
the anode, however, only the electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen
was considered for H2/CO hybrid-fuel operation. With a proper
arrangement of graded catalyst density, the temperature and molar
distributions showed that the raw fuel flows along the axis of the
internal reformer to be moderately reformed and returns at the end
of the internal reformer as a sufficiently reformed fuel. The effects of
fuel/air recirculation and fuel/air inlet temperature were also exam-
ined, under the condition that the maximum temperature of the
stack was kept at 1300 K by adjusting the air flow rate

PA finite volume model of a TSOFC was established by Campanari
and Iora [108] . The model is a 1D one along the gas flow direction.
The detailed electrochemical and thermal analysis to a TSOFC was
available if geometry & material properties were given and input
flows were assigned. The ohmic, activation and diffusion losses were
taken into account, in which the ohmic loss was calculated based on
the equivalent circuit model. Anode and cathode activation polariza-
tion sensitivity analysis was performed by varying four operating
parameters: activation overpotential pre-exponential coefficient
and activation energy of anode and cathode. Some parametric analy-
sis was also performed to investigate the effects of interconnect
resistivity, operating temperatures, the Nusselt number for convec-
tive heat transfer, and different parameters for reforming reaction
kinetics, on the cell performance. The results showed that the impor-
tance of the adoption of appropriate parameters for the evaluation of
activation polarization, as well as the relevance of a kinetic model for
reforming reactions, while diffusion losses only slightly affect the
fuel cell operation due to the high operating temperatures of SOFCs.
PAguiar et al. [116] developed a steady-state model of IIR-SOFC
system, in which a 1D SOFC model is coupled with a heterogeneous,
2D steam reforming packed-bed reactor model. Thermal couple
between the endothermic MSRR and the exothermic electrochemical
reactions was analyzed. The model considered energy balances of
fuel channel, air channel and solid structure, in which a ‘simple’ radi-
ative model was used for radiation heat transfer. Both the H2 and CO
current output was considered by using a linear superposition rate
of H2 and CO polarizations with activation resistances in Arrhenius's
form. Some analyses of parameter sensitivity had been performed to
investigate the effects of the catalyst activity, current density, fuel
inlet temperature and operating pressure. Operating at a high pres-
sure was shown to be an effective way to alleviate the thermal mis-
match between the heat requested by the reforming rate and the
heat available from SOFC. Simulation for both co-/counter-flow con-
figurations had also been performed and compared. The main short-
coming of the SOFC model is to assume the constant gas velocity
in the flow channel. With this regard, Iora and Aguiar et al. [222]
further compared the fuel cell performance with two DIR-PSOFC
models, i.e. taking the constant or variable local flow properties
throughout the system. The two models were found to make good
consistency in predicting the overall cell performance, however,
there are increasing discrepancies in details between them, espe-
cially the fields in the fuel channel as the current density increases.

P2.3.3.2. Transient models.
PIn the commercial software package,
gPROMS, Aguiar et al. [82] developed a dynamic intermediate-tem-
perature (IT) DIR-SOFC model along the flow direction for both co-
and counter-flow operation. The model considered energy balances
of fuel channel, air channel and solid structure, in which a ‘simple’
radiative model was used for radiation heat transfer. Only the elec-
trochemical oxidation of hydrogen was considered. The steady-state
cell performance and the effects of variation of fuel/air inlet temper-
atures, electric load, fuel utilization, and flow configuration were
first studied. Under the same operating conditions, the co-flow oper-
ation was shown to result in smoother current density profile and
more gradual temperature gradients than the counter-flow running.
Then the model-based dynamic performance with respect to load
change was investigated [223]. With respect to a positive/negative
load step change, the open-loop transient response exhibited an
undershoot/overshoot of the cell voltage, accompanied with an
increment/decrement of the overall SOFC temperature. The time
constant of the transient response of the temperature change of the
IT DIR-SOFC was found to be in the order of 1000 s. The transient
model was further integrated with a master controller of fuel/air
flow rates and a feedback temperature controller, and the closed-
loop dynamic behaviors and control strategies were investigated.

POta et al. [224] simulated dynamic behaviors of a micro TSOFC by
using a 1D model, in which the cell was discretized into a series of
sliced cells along the flow direction. The distributions of current, gas
concentration and temperature at the steady/transient states were
investigated. The transient electrical and temperature response to a
load change was simulated for both cells with the diameter of
22 mm (standard SWPC TSOFC) and the diameter of 2.4 mm (micro
TSOFC). The steady-state simulation showed that the temperature
gradient in the micro cell is six times steeper than that in the stan-
dard cell. On the other hand, the results of the transient simulation
showed the much quicker response to a load change in the micro
TSOFC.

PZhu and Kee [170] proposed a transient model of an anode-sup-
ported SOFC membrane-electrode assembly. A button-cell configu-
ration was used, with the fuel and air flows modeled as perfectly
stirred reactors. Porous-media transport was represented by the 1D
dusty-gas model, which includes elementary heterogeneous chemi-
cal reaction, ion conduction, and electrochemical charge transfer.
Dynamics of mass transfer and double-layer charge transfer were
considered. The model was then used to fulfill physics-based EIS pre-
diction for both the cases with hydrogen fuel and methane fuel.
Impedance spectra were determined by imposing oscillating electric
currents over a range of frequencies and observing the resulting cell
voltage. The results showed that internal-reforming chemistry
affects impedance spectra significantly.

PJiang et al. [225] put forward an improved 1D dynamic model of a
TSOFC stack, integrated with an external reformer. The novel point
of this article is that the system was carried out in the virtual test
bed (VTB) simulation environment. Without considering the radia-
tion heat transfer between solid surfaces, the along-the-channel gas
temperature gradient was assumed to be only dependent on the
convective heat exchange between the gas/solid phases. The param-
eters such as pressure ratio, stack temperature, fuel/air inlet temper-
ature, fuel/air mass flow rate, external reforming degree and stream/
carbon ratio were investigated. However, analysis of the dynamic
behaviors of the stack was not included.

PCheddie and Munroe [226] developed a 1D dynamic SOFC model,
in which comprehensive transport phenomena and three kinds of
polarization were proposed in control volumes along the flow direc-
tion. Some assumptions, e.g. uniform distribution of current density,
cell potential and therefore heat generation due to cell irreversibil-
ities at each nodal points, were employed to meet the real-time
fidelity with a computational time of 3.8 ms at each iteration. The
simulation results The temperature difference across the cell was

Pindicated to be over than 100 K. With respect to the current step
change, there was the expected overshoot and undershoot of the cell
voltage followed by a period of stabilization, and the temperature
took a longer relaxation time to get steady. The dynamic response of
the anode and cathode outlet temperature to the load change were
also studied.

PKang et al. [227] proposed a reduced 1D dynamic model for co-
flow DIR-PSOFC. Two simplifications called integration and average
were employed for system study: (a) The PEN, gas channels and
interconnects were integrated together to make an average solid
temperature along the cross-wise direction. (b) Uniform distribution
of the current density was considered, and the cell voltage was
assumed dependent on the average cell temperature and the average
gas molar fractions. Compared with the dynamic responses of the
detailed model without these two assumptions, with respect to load
current disturbances, the accuracy of the reduced model was not sig-
nificantly compromised in the prediction of the outlet gas flow rates
and molar fractions, the outlet temperatures, and the cell voltage,
whereas the computational time was significantly decreased. The
reduced model had an advantage over the lumped one in accuracy,
as it can be viewed as a series of scale-down lumped models to pro-
vide the spatial characteristics of SOFCs to some extent.

P2.3.4. 0D models

PThe 0D model is the simplest one without considering the model
size and the distribution of crucial parameters in the space and has
been widely used for system-level simulation. Just like the black-
box model, only the changes between the input and output are taken
into account. For steady-state analysis, the 0D models are quasi-
equilibrium, i.e. the conservation laws simply express a mass/energy
balance between the inflow and outflow in each component, and the
chemical reactions are considered in equilibrium. For transient anal-
ysis, the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model with the
lumped dynamics (e.g. the filling dynamics of the manifold, global
kinetics of chemical reactions) is usually adopted for the control-ori-
ented study. On the other hand, the 0D approach has been also
widely used in the studies focusing on modeling the elementary
electrochemical mechanisms [166,167,172]. Here, we only pay
attention to the 0D transient or control-oriented cell-level or stack-
level (not considering the inter-cell difference) models. The 0D SOFC
models involved in the hybrid system and power system will be
introduced in next sections.

PA zero-dimension SOFC model was previously proposed by Debe-
nedetti and Vayenas [228], to present a model describing the steady-
state behavior of SOFC and to identify the important dimensionless
numbers and consequent scale-up criteria for their efficient design
and operation. Similar to usual well-mixed chemical reactors, SOFCs
were found to exhibit steady-state multiplicity over a wide range of
parameters. The relative importance of the pertinent design and
operating parameters were discussed in order to maintain stable
self-sustained ignited steady states corresponding to high current
densities and nearly complete fuel conversion.

PPadulles et al. [229] developed a control-oriented SOFC model
for dynamic simulation of a power system. Based on the control
theory, the dynamics of the SOFC model was constructed with the
transfer functions in the Laplace transform domain, rather than by
the conservation laws in the time domain. The flow of hydrogen,
oxygen, and water in the plenum were represented simply by a
first-order lag model of their respective time constants. As that the
response time of PCU is similar to the simulator integration step
(10 ms), the dynamics of the PCU (switching model of the solid-
state devices) was not included to avoid the risk of potential
numerical instabilities.

PSorrentino et al. [230] presented a hierarchical control-oriented
modeling and analysis of PSOFCs. At the high level, a 1D (along with
the flow direction), the steady-state physical model was developed

Pbased on the conservation laws. At the low level, a lumped (CSTR),
the control-oriented model was developed by assuming the SOFC
behaves as a first-order time-variant system, with the only state of
the gas outlet temperature. The performance data provided by the
physical model was also used to generate a black-box model of the
cell voltage, as a nonlinear function of the electric load, the gas out-
let temperature and the excess of air fed to the stack. Relevant to
the fast process of electrochemistry and mass transfer, the thermal
dynamics was the rate-limiting process for the whole system.
Based on performance metrics of voltage undershoot magnitude
and voltage relaxation time, the SOFC dynamics was found to be
significantly dependent on the load-step magnitude and terminal
current. A proportional-integral (PI) controller was also employed
to keep the temperature difference between the gas inlet and out-
let temperatures.

PAlso based on the hierarchical approach, a lumped, control-ori-
ented dynamic model was established by Zhang et al. [231]. The spa-
tial characteristics of the temperature and gas composition in the
streamwise direction were fitted by both the exponent decay func-
tion and the exponent associate function. Based on the distributed
performance obtained by simulation of a detailed 3D physical model,
the spatial characteristics was introduced into the lumped transient
model by fitting the two used functions. The transient simulation
showed that most of the state variables are first-order response
except the CO molar fraction which is a second-order term.

PIn the control-orient model developed by Xi et al. [232], the mini-
mum Gibbs free energy (MGFE) method was exploited to achieve a
balance between simplicity and model accuracy for the mass conser-
vation of the fuel flow. A transient lumped model was first derived
for the baseline (detailed) mass conservation of individual fuel gas
species. Using the MGFE approach, the baseline model with 11 states
was simplified to the control-orient model with 6 states, i.e. a signifi-
cantly lower order model. Compared with the baseline model for
steady-state and transient operations, in time/frequency domain,
the control-orient model had got acceptable accuracy under normal
conditions. However,
in steady-state
responses were observed in cases of the high CH4 molar fraction in
fuel and low fuel utilization, also in transient responses at high-fre-
quency disturbances.

significant deviations

PAs both the high-temperature reactors, molten carbonate fuel cell
(MCFC) and SOFC have some common features and processes, like
internal reforming, thermal management, etc. Lukas et al. [233]
developed a lumped dynamic model to study transient effects on a
direct reforming MCFC stack, which was part of the largest demon-
stration of MCFC technology in California's 2-MW Santa Clara Dem-
onstration Project (SCDP). Both IIR and DIR design were discussed in
the system layout, in the IIR design, at intervals of ten cells in the
stack there is a Ni-based catalyst reforming unit (RU). The CSTR
approach was used to lump the cathode, anode and its coupling with
the RU. Considering the equilibrium assumption used for the WGSR,
which results in an implicit differential and algebraic equation (DAE)
set, an explicit set of differential equations was derived by eliminat-
ing the time-dependent term of H2O molar fraction associated with
the WGSR. With respect to a sudden load change, transient results
were provided for the response of anode and cathode gas composi-
tion, fuel utilization, anode and cathode pressures, stack tempera-
ture and stack voltage. The dependence of electrode polarization
losses on the inlet fuel composition was further proposed by experi-
mental correlations with the same model framework [234].

PBesides the fundamental modeling, black-box or fitting modeling
provide an alternative approach. Arriagada et al. [235] developed an
artificial neural network (ANN) model to fit the I-V characteristics of
SOFC. The ANN model was trained well with part of the data gener-
ated by a validated mechanistic model, as the average error was less
than 1% and the maximum error was below 4%. Then the ANN model
can predict various operation parameters of the fuel cell (e.g. gas

Pflows, current density, voltage, etc.), avoiding a detailed description
of the fuel cell processes. With much faster computation, such an
approach is suitable for generation of performance maps and large-
scale system optimization.

PTable 5 made a summary of the representative SOFC models. A
similar review for both SOFC and PEMFC can be found in [236], here,
we made more details in the SOFC part.

P2.3.5. Semi-empirical and analytical models

PWith the advantage of low computation cost, the semi-empirical
models aim to obtain coarse evaluations of the overall performance
of cell or system. Campanari [237] proposed a SOFC model aiming at
a thermodynamic and parametric study on SOFC and hybrid system.
A ‘‘reference’ ’ voltage-current curve was firstly defined, which was
obtained by interpolation of experimental data measured at the
same fuel composition, fuel/air utilization coefficients, and operating
temperature and pressure. Under different values of these variables,
the actual fuel cell voltage was calculated using semi-empirical cor-
relations. These correlations were expressed by the logarithmic cor-
rections, derived by the Nernst potential equation, and modified
with the adoption of an empirical multiplying coefficients. Such an
empirical approach deliberately avoids a detailed description of the
physical properties and structural parameters of the cell, like poros-
ity, conductivity, etc. As all of the equations were implemented fol-
lowing algebraic computation, the model can run very fast, and it
was calibrated on the overall thermodynamic performance for a
demonstrated TSOFC prototype plant. The simplified approach also
enables to implement the parametric analysis for variation of the
operation current, fuel utilization, and steam to carbon ratio.

PFocusing on the thermodynamic performance, the 0D SOFC
model of Lazzaretto et al. [238] designed the variables including fuel
molar flow/air rate and temperature at the SOFC inlet, SOFC operat-
ing pressure, fuel and air utilization factors, and the steam to carbon
ratio of the anode recycle. Both the reforming reaction and the
WGSR were assumed in equilibrium, and the ohmic losses were
evaluated considering that electrolyte resistance is 12% of the overall
ohmic resistance in the tubular design. Aiming at a life-cycle evalua-
tion of combined cycle with SOFC and gas turbine, Tanaka et al.
[239] assumed that the constant activation overpotential in the
anode, and correlated the cathodic activation overpotential to the
operation current density by a simple polynomial fitting.

PCelik et al. [240] proposed a new semi-empirical SOFC model,
which was formulated to calculate the potential differences at the A/
E and cathode/electrolyte (C/E) interfaces separately. Based on a
reduced reaction mechanism with several elementary steps, the
model accounts for the oxygen ion activity at the two electrode
interfaces, and splits the overall Gibbs free energy of H2 oxidation
reaction (H2 + 1/2O2 ! H2O(g)) into two parts one for the overall
reaction occurring at the C/E interface, and one for those occurring
at the E/A interface. The model also suggested an empirical equation
to estimate the transfer coefficient with the dependence on temper-
ature, b D 0.5(1 + bmin) + 0.5(1 ¡ bmin)tanh[g(T ¡ Ts)], where g and Ts
are the fitting parameters. According to the data of Godickemeier
and Gauckler [241], the typical values were recommended as
bmin D 0.2, Ts D 900 K, g D 0.06, or bmin D 0.2, Ts D 950 K, g D 0.02 for
the anode, and bmin D 0.16, Ts D 1035 K, g D 0.006 for the cathode
[240].

PChan et al. [102] proposed a complete polarization model of a
SOFC to show the effect of the thickness of the respective fuel cell
components on the drop in cell voltage. For calculating the relation-
ship between voltage and current density, the general expression
was used

in which E0 is the electromotive force (emf) governed by the Nernst
equation, h is the overpotential. For calculating the activation

Ppolarization, symmetry of the anodic and cathodic transfer coeffi-
cients (a D b D 0.5) in Butler-Volmer equation was assumed to get a
hyperbolic sine (sinh) formulation (cf. Table 3). Following the Fick's
law, the concentration polarization was derived from the equimolar
diffusion for the H2(cid:1)(cid:1)H2O binary fuel system. With all of the alge-
braic calculations, this model eliminates the ambiguity of its suit-
ability under different design and operating conditions.

PAlso accounting for the three kinds of polarizations for H2(cid:1)(cid:1)H2O
fueled operation, Kim et al. [103] analytically proposed a voltage-
current density relationship as

PThe equation contains five fitting parameters, namely, a, b, Ri, ias

form as a (cid:6) ¡ RTlni0/(4aF) and b (cid:6) ¡ RT/(4aF), where i0 the exchange
current density, a the transfer coefficient. The overall resistance is in
the form of Ri D Rel + Reff

effective charge-transfer resistance modeled by Tanner et al. [120]
and Virkar et al. [121], in which Rct D RT/neFi0 is the intrinsic charge-
transfer resistance, Vv is the fractional porosity, B is the electrolyte
grain size in the composite electrode. The anode-side and cathode-
side limiting current densities, ias and ics, can be estimated from the
mass-transfer model (DGM in [103]), or be determined by the short-
circuit current density in experiments. For an anode-supported Ni-
YSZ|YSZ|LSM-YSZ cell operated with H2(cid:1)(cid:1)H2O binary fuel, a typical
set of values was given as Ri D 0.068 V cm2, a D 0.05 V, b D 0.0247 V,
i0 D 0.132 A cm¡2, ias D 5.65 A cm¡2 at 800 °C [103].

PAn accurate electrode-level and cell-level model with low
computational cost are valuable for system-level analysis, especially
for controller design and real-time simulations. Approximate analyt-
ical solutions of the differential equations provide a trade-off
between mechanistic models and semi-empirical approaches. Gurau
et al. [242] proposed an exact solution of a 1D transport model by
assuming constant overpotential in the catalyst layer of PEMFC. Tsai
et al. [243] derived an analytical solution of a 2D oxygen transport
model in a PEMFC, where the cathode catalyst layer was handled to
be infinitely thin. With the assumption of constant exchange current
density and gas concentration, Costamagna et al. [244] obtained an
analytical profile of the activation overpotential in SOFC electrodes.
Some approximate analytical expressions were also developed for
modeling channel flow and heat transfer in fuel cells [245,246]. An
overview of analytical fuel cell models was given in Kulikovsky's
book [247].

PWe have also paid much attention to the analytical solutions of
electrochemistry and transport in SOFC. Based on the regular and
singular perturbation method, Bao et al. [248] developed an analyti-
cal approximation of electrode-level model with coupled charge/
mass transfer for binary fuel system

where Y D neFh/RT is the dimensionless overpotential, z is dimen-
sionless coordinate along the anode thickness, xH2;b is the bulk molar
fraction of hydrogen, e is the perturbation variable, b, C6, C8, λ1 and λ2
are parameters. The overpotential profile contains a logarithmic
term due to mass transfer and two exponent terms resulting from
electrochemistry, which reflect the boundary-layer effects in two
ends of the anode. The dimensionless thickness of the boundary

Player of electrochemical reaction and utilization factor of catalysts in
the anode have also been analytically obtained [248].

PThe intrinsic linearization of exponent item in Butler-Volmer for-
mulation limits the accuracy of the perturbation method at medium
and high overpotential. In this regard, Bao et al. [36] further devel-
oped a hybrid algorithm of the power-law approach and the WKB
(Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin) perturbation method [249] to
keep the nonlinearity of BV-type electrochemical kinetics. One of
the highlights of the algorithm is to solve the exact dimensionless
overpotential at the A/E interface, YA/E, which can be generally taken
as the overall anode overpotential, considering the electronic con-
ductivity is much larger than the ionic conductivity. Using the
exact dimensionless overpotential as a parameter in the model, the
approach is therefore significantly accuracy in the full range of appli-
cations. Moreover, due to starting from decoupled mass and charge
transfer, this approach is suitable for the multi-component gas mix-
ture, not limited to the binary fuel system.

to pure mathematical methods, like the ADM (Adomian decomposi-

explicit formulation and provides clearer physical meaning.

In addition, when compared to the 1D + 1D computation, the 1D
(along with the thickness of electrode) model was revealed to get
the best performance when the logarithmic mean of reactant con-
centrations at the inlet and outlet is taken as the bulk concentration
at the A/C interface. Bove et al. [251] noticed the effect of the along-
the-channel variation of gas composition on 1D modeling along the
thickness of the electrode, anyway, only three kinds of bulk concen-
trations i.e.
inlet/outlet gases compositions, and the arithmetic
mean of the previous two, were discussed in their work.

PIn the aspect of analytical solution of the electrode-level mecha-
nistic model, Bao et al. [122] developed a novel nonlinear expression
to interconvert the volume- and area-specific exchange current den-
sities (cf. Section 2.2.2.1), and developed a nonlinear superposition
rate of global kinetics H2/CO electrochemical co-oxidation by a
mathematical approach [47,138] (cf. Section 2.2.2.2). For heat trans-
fer in channel flow, Bao et al. [92] analytically presented both the dif-
ferential and finite-difference view factor models for detailed
radiative heat transfer in both the planar and tubular configurations
(cf. Section 2.2.1.2).

3. Balance of plant

PThe balance of plant (BOP) is needed even for the stand-alone
SOFC operation. The BOP refers to the supporting equipment and
auxiliary components that are required to operate a power plant or
energy system. Although it is not inevitable, GT is generally config-
ured to further utilize the energy of the high-temperature gases at
SOFC outlet. As the second power source for electricity output, and
with good transient performance to compensate the large thermal
inertia of SOFC stack, GT is the most important unit of BOP. External
reformers, usually steam reformers in the SOFC system, are usually
required to pre-reform hydrocarbon fuel into H2-rich gas. Heat
exchangers are naturally inevitable for heat recovery of high-tem-
perature exhaust fluid and preheating of cold inlet fluid. Tube-shell
heat exchangers are the most used configuration, and compact heat
exchangers are widely used for high effectiveness. Ejectors are usu-
ally used for anode or cathode gas recirculation, e.g. anode outflow
is generally pumped into pre-reformer to use the water product and
high-temperature enthalpy in the anode outlet gas. Combustors or
burners are used to utilize the chemical energy of the fuel, and they
may also play important roles in transient, e.g. start-up, operation.
There are also other balancing units, such as mixers, splitters, pipe-
lines, and shafts, for mass distribution, fluid transportation, and
mechanic transmission, etc.

PIt is hard to evaluate the pros and cons of the existing technolo-
gies of balancing units in one word, as it is quite dependent on the
system size, layouts, fuel type, etc. For example, pressurized and
atmospheric layouts make a different requirement on heat exchang-
ers, single-/double-shaft GT make difference in system cost and flex-
ibility, large-/small-size GT have different adjustment method (and
therefore different auxiliary units), multiple combustors may be
configured for better startup behaviors, etc. Coupled with SOFC also
brings different requirements on balancing units compared to their
stand-alone operation. For example, the conventional GT design
should be updated, as that the SOFC anode outlet gas has quite a dif-
ferent composition and heat value, and burner takes the function of
the conventional combustion chamber of GT. Also, for example, the
heat surfaces of pre-reformer should be redesigned if it is provided
heat by radiation from the SOFC stack. In general, the optimum point
of the whole system does not mean the optimal operation of every
unit. We can understand these in the subsequent details about
SOFC/GT hybrid system. Relative to the detailed modeling of SOFC, a
basic summary of BOP unit models is made next for general purpose.

P3.1.1.2. Performance-based models.
PModeling of the compressor and
turbine (C/T) in the fuel cell system are normally based on fitting
their performance curves or map. There are four basic parameters of
turbomachinery's performance, namely pressure ratio (p), efficiency
(h), mass flow rate ð _mÞ and rotational speed (N, usually in unit

PTwo kinds of formulation, i.e. ’ D f(Ncr,p) and p D f(Ncr,’), are
both frequently used in system-level models, especially in transient
simulation. In a typical performance of a centrifugal compressor,
the speed contours near the surge region is almost perpendicular
to the axis of pressure ratio. Corresponding to a small variation of p,
the form of ’ D f(Ncr,p) could generate a large variation of ’, and
even multiple values of ’. With a sharp rate of performance, the
form of p D f(Ncr,’) has the similar mathematical problem near the
choke region.

P(2) Jensen & Kristensen model
PThe Jensen & Kristensen (J/K) model has been widely used for
modeling turbocharger in internal combustion engines [253]. The
core of the J/K compressor model is two dimensionless parameters,
i.e. the dimensionless head parameter (C) and the dimensionless
flow rate (F)

PThe b line model is the most widely used one for fitting perfor-
mance map of turbomachinery. The value of b itself has no physical
meaning and b lines work as a set of auxiliary lines. Designed to
solve the above-mentioned problem of large slope rate of perfor-
mance curves, b lines are a set of equally-interval curves, normally
straight lines or parabolas, which have got only one intersection
point with each speed contour [112,254(cid:1)256]. By setting two auxil-
iary lines at b D 0 and b D 1, corresponding to the lower and upper
bound of performance map, respectively, all the polynomial coeffi-
cients of b lines in the middle can be determined by equal-interval
interpolation. Thus the property variables (’, p, h) can be corre-
lated to the normalized rational speed and b in the form of nonlinear
polynomials

PThe turbine model can be handled similarly using b line grids.
However, gas chokes at the turbine inlet above a certain pressure
ratio, in this case, the mass flow rate keeps constant with respect to
the variation of pressure ratio and b. Instead of a polynomial func-
tion, an elliptic form is used to get the asymptotic characteristics of
mass flow rate

P(4) Neural network model
PThe b line model is an intrinsic approach of interpolation, as that
all the data are required to be within the envelope of b line grids.
With a layout of feed-forward multilayer perceptron, the neural
network has the ability to approximate any function with a finite
number of discontinuities, and therefore it has much better generali-
zation property for extrapolation.

PIn order to have the network trained well, some preprocessing,
such as normalization is inevitable. Moraal and Kolmanovsky [253]
compared four methods treating the map of the centrifugal com-
pressor/turbine and found the neural network has the best perfor-
mance. Anyway, due to the problem of sharp slope in performance
map, they failed in training the network to approximate the nonlin-
ear relationship ’ D f(Ncr,p) instead of p D f(Ncr,’). With this respect,
Bao et al. [257] presented the technology of coordinate transform (i.
e. Givens transform) for data preprocessing.

PFig. 9 shows the flow chart of a neural network model of com-
pressor and turbine (C/T) [75,257]. The network is trained by using
the preprocessed (similarity and coordinate transform) sample data.
A method called early stopping is usually used to improve generali-
zation and avoid overfitting in network training, by this technique,
the available data are divided into a training set, a validation set, and
a test set. The network output is post-processed by inverse coordi-
nate transform and inverse similarity to the real domain of the out-
put variable. Appendix A gives the trained back-propagation (BP)
neural networks for fitting the most common used C/T maps in
SOFC/GT system, in which the compressor map is based on a DLR
centrifugal compressor map, while the turbine map is for a NASA-
CR-174646 axial turbine [258]. The surge line can be easily fitted by
a simple polynomial.

P3.1.2. Transient models

PA lot of interests have been raised on the dynamic characteristics
of turbines for power system, in which the control-oriental models
of turbine are generally implemented based on transfer functions in
the classical control theory, i.e. the frequency response with respect
to the time-domain dynamics handled by Laplace transform, or
based on state space in the model control theory [24,259(cid:1)262]. The
review [263] summarized wind turbine models for transient simula-
tion in power system.

PThe transient models of a gas turbine for SOFC/GT simulation are
somehow simple. According to Newton's second law, for a single-
shaft turbine generator, there is

where J is the moment of inertia, v D 30p/N is the angular speed, Tt
and Tc is the torque of turbine and compressor, respectively, Pe is the
electricity generation power. The variation of mass flow rate, pres-
sure ratio, and efficiency are normally considered to be simultaneous
with respect to the variation of revolutionary speed, which is defined
by the steady-state performance map.

PBesides the mechanical inertia, the thermal inertia of recuperator
and combustor plays also a great role in the transient behaviors of
the gas turbine unit [264]. Li et al. [265] established a mathematical
dynamic model of MGTs for all operating modes, which was solved
by the modular modeling method and fluid networks. The dynamic
characteristics of MGTs were studied in their full operating range
from 100% to 0% load and those of sudden load rejection. The MGT
showed a second-order system feature, and the heat storage in the
recuperator walls had a remarkable bearing on dynamic characteris-
tics of MGTs.

3.2. Pre-reformer

PA pre-reformer is usually composed to partly or fully reform the
hydrocarbon fuel before it enters the fuel cell. Working at a lower
temperature than the SOFC temperature, this layout can alleviate
the carbon deposit in the SOFC anode [266]. There are generally
three kinds of the reformer of methane, i.e. steam reforming, partial
oxidation or autothermal reforming, among which the steam
reforming is the most used for SOFC running [1].

PAs discussed in Section 2.2.1.2, the conversion rate of the MSRR
over a nickel catalyst is first order, or nearly first order in methane,
while it shows different dependence on steam partial pressures due
to differences in catalyst activities and the range of experimental
conditions. Lee et al. [63] summarized the MSRR rates from seven of
the investigations that were performed at total pressures ranging
from atmosphere to 41 atm, two of which included zero steam
dependence, while the remaining five showed steam reaction orders
of 1 or greater. In general, for total pressure up to 1 atm and high
temperature (T > 800 °C), the effect of steam could hinder the meth-
ane conversion, and for total pressures of 1(cid:1)15 atm and lower tem-
perature (T < 800 °C) the effect of steam could result in an increased
reforming rate.

PA multi-level modeling framework of steam methane reformer
can be set up with quasi-equilibrium steady-state, lumped and dis-
tributed-parameter transient models. The most widely used reform-
ing rate in a fixed bed with Ni-based catalyst was developed by Xu
and Froment [267], in which the standard Langmuir-Hinshelwood
expression was introduced for the MSRR, WGSR and their overall
reaction (CH4 + 2H2O $ 4H2 + CO2)

Pclassical plug flow and heat transfer in a tubular packed bed reactor

PDue to the strong endothermic reaction of methane reforming,
the energy balance of the pre-reformer is usually coupled with the
system configuration. For example, the reforming heat is supplied
by radiation from the SOFC stack in the SWPC 220 kW demo system
and alternatively, is supplied by the high-temperature exhaust gas
out of the SOFC stack in the 25 kW integrated reformer system
[269].

3.3. Heat exchanger

PThe logarithmic mean temperature difference method and the e
(effectiveness)-NTU (number of heat transfer units) method are the
broadest for 0D heat exchanger models. Table 7 collected some ana-
lytical e-NTU expressions of the heat exchanger in various flow
modes [270].

PFor compact heat exchangers, there are some key variables,
including the ratio of the total heat transfer area (A) to the volume
(V), i.e. a D A/V, ratio of the free flow area (Afree) to the frontal area
(Afr) at a given fluid side, i.e. s D Afree/Afr, and the hydraulic radius of
flow path, i.e. rhyd D LAfree/A, where L is the length of flow path. The
relationship among them is [270]

3.4. Ejector

PWithout moving components, an ejector utilizes high-pressure
fluid to inject and compress the low-pressure fluid. As shown in
Fig. 10, the working fluid (subscripted as P) flows across the nozzle
and inhales the injected fluid (H) into the receiving chamber, and
then the two fluids mix and exchange energy and momentum and
become the compressed fluid (C) in the mixing chamber. After that,
the kinetic energy is further turned into the pressure energy in the
expansion section or diffuser. The key geometries of an ejector are
the minimum section area of the nozzle, fP1, and the section area of
the mixing chamber, f3.

PSome thermodynamic variables could be first defined according
to the theory of gas ejectors [272]. The first one is the normalized
isentropic velocity (λ), i.e. the ratio of the adiabatic velocity va to the
critical velocity a* (local velocity of sound)

where yi is the mass fraction of species i, ’1»’4 are correction coeffi-
cients accounting for friction loss and machining process, and could
be generally set to ’1 D 0.95, ’2 D 0.975, ’3 D 0.9, ’4 D 0.925 [272].
The variable fP2 is the area occupied by the working fluid at section
2, i.e. the entrance of the mixing chamber (cf. Fig. 10). As the working
fluid and the injected fluid are considered to be unmixed before
entering the mixing chamber, there is fP2 D fP*/qPH, where fP* is the
local area of the working fluid when the local sound velocity is
reached.

PThe pressure difference between pH and pC in the anode recycling
loop is generally small. In this case, both of the injected fluid and the
compressed fluid can be considered to be inelastic, i.e. kP D kC D 1,
P D 1 ¡ λ2, q D λ, e D 1, kP* D 2, and therefore used to simply the
computation. Bao et al. have used such an approach in modeling
anode gas recycling in both PEMFC and SOFC system [273,75].

PThe injection coefficient, u D WH/WP,

i.e. the content of the
injected fluid injected by a unit mass of the working fluid, is the key
variable to evaluate the performance of an ejector. In addition, three
limiting conditions should be considered [272]. The first two limiting
conditions is that the injected fluid reaches the local sound velocity
at the entrance (cf. section 2 in Fig. 10) or at some section (e.g.
section S in Fig. 10) of the mixing chamber, i.e. λH2 D qH2 D 1 or
λHS D qHS D 1, the corresponding injection coefficients are respec-
tively [272]

PUnder the similar framework, Marsano et al. [274] presented the
quasi-static model of the ejector and analyzed the influence of ejec-
tor performance on a SOFC anodic recirculation system. Ferrari et al.
[275] further proposed a transient ejector model with the hypothesis
of adiabatic flow and semi-ideal gas, i.e. there is the equation of state
of ideal gas and variable specific heats, resulting from temperature

Pand composition. Based on the one-dimensional Euler fluid dynamic
equations with source terms, integrated using an explicit scheme,
the method was useful and effective for plant simulations, because it
showed the main fluid dynamic phenomena with a good flexibility
for the introduction of source terms for viscous pressure losses, heat
exchanges, and so on. The “dynamic” and “lumped volume” ejector
models were then tested and validated and used to analyze the
effect of transient behaviors of the ejector on the SOFC recirculation
circuit, such as time-dependent steam-to-carbon ratio.

3.5. Others

POther balancing units, such as combustor, mixer, splitter, pipe-
line, and shaft, etc., can be simply modeled in zero dimension by
mass and energy balance in thermodynamics or in CSTR models
with dynamics of filling/releasing manifolds.

4. SOFC/GT hybrid system

PAs listed in Table 8, there have been a lot of studies on modeling
and simulation of the hybrid system combined with SOFC or MCFC
and gas turbine.

PThe model-based study on high-temperature fuel cell system are

generally focused on:

P(1) System configurations, including pressurized/atmospheric lay-
out and new layouts, e.g. FC-Reformer-FC concept, placement of
additional external combustor and bypass valves, etc.

P(2) Design and off-design performance, system optimization based

on energy and exergy analysis.

P(3) Safe and healthy operation region and constraints to operating

parameters.

P(4) Transient behaviors and load following, e.g. characteristic
time constants and dynamics response with respect to the

Pvariation of gas flow rate and electric load, and various con-
trol strategies.

P(5) Different controller designs, e.g. Proportion Integration Differen-
tiation (PID) controller, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) con-
troller, and model-predictive controller (MPC), etc.

P(6) Hardware-in-the-loop simulation and system integration.

PAlso, some research groups have developed their own simulation
tools for high-temperature fuel cell systems, like advanced power
system analysis tool (APSAT) by National Fuel Cell Research Center
(NFCRC), TRANSEO code by University of Genova, gPROMS code by
NTNU, etc. Based on a commercial package of gPROMS, Bao et al.
[276] developed an in-house simulation platform for integrated
optimization, dynamics analysis and controller design of SOFC/GT
hybrid system. A multi-level model library of natural gas fueled
IRSOFC was developed, and some specific work on balancing unit
models was also included [19,75]. With graphic specification, the
simulation platform can be easily used for flexible configuration and
modular design among individual unit models with proper complex-
ity. Validated by the steady-state experimental data of SWPC demo
system, the simulation platform overperforms the APSAT. More
importantly, it can be applied for sizing/rating problem, off-design,
and transient analysis.

4.1. System layout

PThe layout of a SOFC/GT hybrid system depends on several design
parameters, such as operating temperature, pressure, fuel type,
reforming type (external/internal,
IIR/DIR), supplying type for
reforming heat (radiation, fuel burning, exhaust heat recovery) and
steam (anode recirculation or boiling), type of combined Bryton
cycle, etc. [15]. There are two basic configurations of high-tempera-
ture fuel cell and gas turbine hybrid system, i.e. top cycle and bottom
cycle, or pressurized cycle and atmospheric cycle [1,15,277].

PMassardo and Lubelli [52] presented four layouts of IRSOFC/GT
hybrid system, as shown in Fig. 11. In bottom cycles, the outlet air of
the compressor is preheated in the heat exchanger by the high-tem-
perature exhaust gas of the SOFC cathode (cf. Fig. 11(a)) or of the
combustor (cf. Fig. 11(b)), and then enters the SOFC cathode after
propelling the gas turbine. As SOFC does not act as the combustion
chamber of the turbine unit, SOFC and GT can be decoupled to work
at atmospheric pressure and high pressure, respectively. As a result,
the system flexibility is improved and the problem of material and
sealing of SOFCs is alleviated, meanwhile, there is relatively low sys-
tem efficiency at low-pressure operation and high requirement of
heat exchangers. The bottom cycle is more popular in MCFC/GT
hybrid system.

PIn the top cycle, SOFC works under high pressure as the combus-
tion chamber of the turbine unit. Opposite to the bottom cycle, the
top cycle has got higher system efficiency and lighter requirement
on the recuperator, while it gets more challenges for SOFC materials.

PIn Fig. 11(c), there is a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) in addi-
tion to the gas turbine, which makes a combined cycle with Brayton
cycle of gas turbine and Rankine cycle of the steam turbine. In
Fig. 11(d), steam is alternatively introduced to improve the working
ability of the high-temperature inlet gas of the gas turbine, which
reduces the system cost by deleting the steam turbine. Such a layout
is called Cheng cycle, i.e. introduce steam as additional working
substance. Some researchers presented the similar concept of
SOFC(cid:1)(cid:1)HAT (humid air turbine) system [278], i.e. used a humidifier
to replace the HRSG, in which the liquid water is mixed with the out-
let air of compressor. The top cycle is the most popular in SOFC/GT
hybrid system. In addition to the general configuration of the top
cycle (without HRSG, HAT), anode gas recirculation is also config-
ured in the SWPC 220 kW demo hybrid power system, as shown in
Fig. 12, which has been the most widely used prototype for modeling
validation. More layouts of SOFC/GT hybrid system for combined
heat and power have been summarized in the recent review [277].

Psevere vibration of the whole unit may cause the blade fracture
and fly out in a few seconds. So anti-surge protection of the unit
is indispensable. The compressor surge margin (SM) is defined by
SM D [psurge(’) ¡ p(Ncr,’)]/p(Ncr,’), where p(Ncr,’) and psurge(’) is
the actual pressure ratio and the surge pressure ratio at the actual
mass flow and shaft speed, respectively [279]. Higher SM means
safer operation, but meanwhile the lower efficiency of the compres-
sor. Choking is another unstable phenomenon in compressor opera-
tion, which occurs at high air flow rate under a certain speed.

PAn ejector fails to work when the pressure of the working fluid is
lower than the pressure of the injected fluid in the entry of the mix-
ing chamber. In the SOFC/GT system, this situation often occurs
when the gas pressure in the combustor, i.e. the pressure in the
anode recirculation loop (cf. Fig. 12) goes abnormally high. This will
cause the deterioration of ejector performance, and therefore the
strong drop of the SCR and the system vibrations. The gas backflow
from the combustor to the anode channel will also lead to exposing
the anode to the oxygen-containing atmosphere and therefore make
the Ni catalyst oxidized (i.e. anode oxidation) and deactivated.

PCorresponding to the design point, the safe operation region of
SOFC/GT hybrid system is often spanned by the relative fuel flow
rate and the relative air flow rate. Stiller presented the safe regime
for steady-state operation based on a configuration of the SWPC
demo SOFC/GT hybrid system [255]. As shown in Fig. 13(a), it is
enclosed by the unsafe issues including high temperature, voltage
too low, turbine speed too low and too high, compressor speed too
low and also ejector malfunction. The carbon deposition in the
reformer was found not to be critical according to the calculation.
The upper and left zone of the performance map means the over-
heating (mainly SOFC) issue, as the fuel flow rate is higher than the
air flow rate, relative to the design-point air/fuel ratio. Vice versa,
when the air/fuel ratio is too high, the low SOFC temperature occurs
and leads to the low cell voltage. Too low fuel and air flow rates
result in a low speed of turbine and compressor. It is interesting that
the small fuel flow rate and the high air flow rate lead to the high
turbine speed. This is because that the high air/fuel ratio makes the
low SOFC temperature and therefore the low current output, i.e.
the high fuel stoichiometric ratio even at the low fuel flow rate. At
the very low fuel flow rate, the ejector malfunction occurs due to the
negative pressure difference between the working fluid and the
injected fluid.

PLv et al. [280] proposed the safe zone for an intermediate-tem-
perature SOFC/GT hybrid system fueled by biomass gas. As shown in
Fig. 13(b), at the too low air flow and high fuel flow, and oppositely
the too high air flow and low fuel flow, there is two energy unbal-
ance zones due to mismatched air/fuel ratio. At the higher fuel flow,
the more anode outlet fuel is burned in the combustor and therefore
the higher TIT and the higher SOFC temperature. When the fuel flow
rate is critically high, overheating and even SOFC cracking occur. It is
interesting that the overheating zones decrease at the lower air
flow. Vice versa, the low fuel flow and especially the high air flow
cause the overcooling and too low TIT operation. The lower fuel flow
also decreases the working temperature and leads to carbon deposi-
tion. Note that, the safe region is greatly influenced by the system
layout. In this work, the anode gas recirculation was not configured,
as a result carbon deposition occurs, which was not found in Stiller's
work [255].

PCostamagna and Honegger [111] evaluated the performance of a
planar circular SOFC stack. The model was verified via a comparison
between the simulated and experimental data of temperature profile
and the I-V characteristics in case of the low FU. Temperature gra-
dients of the solid were almost negligible. When the FU reached 90%
(1.5 g h¡1 cell¡1 of hydrogen, 6000 A m¡2 of current density), the
maximum temperature gradient was up to 4.2 K cm¡1. The results
also showed that the I-V curve was close to being linear if the FU
was beyond 80%.

4.2. Safe operation region

PTo ensure system stability and health operation, a comprehensive
consideration of safe operation region is very necessary. The safe
operation region in the performance map means the zone enclosed
by boundaries or limits of unsafe and critical operational issues. To
avoid component malfunctions and heavy system performance dete-
rioration, the feasible operating domain of a SOFC/GT hybrid system
is restricted by the constraints of thermal runaway (too high or too
low temperature), thermal cracking, thermal fatigue, carbon deposi-
tion in reformer and/or SOFC, compressor surge and choke, over
speed, carbon deposition and ejector malfunction, etc.

PThe SOFC operating temperature (TSOFC) is the most important
factor for healthy operation of the stack. If the temperature is far
below the normal value, the electrochemical reaction cannot even
occur. If it is too high, lots of problems will happen, like the stack/
cell sealing problems and the matching problem between compo-
nents (e.g. a higher temperature of the combustion chamber), aging
deterioration and lifetime problem, etc. Furthermore, when the tem-
perature gradient of the solid-phase materials is too large, the ther-
mal stress will increase and the safety of the system operation will
also be threatened.

PThe turbine inlet temperature (TIT) is another important variable
to be monitored. The higher TIT is beneficial to improve the output
power and system efficiency of MGT. On the other hand, the TIT
must be controlled due to the limitation of high-temperature resis-
tant materials. More importantly, the high TIT is easy to cause the
high compressor pressure and also the over speed of the compressor,
which leads to compressor surge and ejector malfunction. Also,
overheating of other components, including reformer, recuperator,
etc., should also be avoided.

PElementary carbon is formed via Boudouard reaction and crack-
ing reactions of hydrocarbon fuel. The carbon deposit causes cover-
ing of the catalyst in the reformer and/or clogging of the pores at the
anode required for gas diffusion. Improving the steam/carbon ratio
(SCR) of the system can effectively avoid the phenomenon of carbon
deposition in the fuel cell. But the negative effect is that the power
efficiency will decrease and the combustible anode exhaust gas will
be much diluted. There should be a balance between these two
points.

PCompressor surge occurs at small air flow rate and high-pressure
ratio. The surge malfunction will not only decrease the compressor
pressure ratio and efficiency sharply but also affect the working con-
dition of combustion chamber and turbine. Correspondingly, the
common situations are just like the flameout within the combustion
chamber and the overheating of the turbine exhaust. Moreover, the

PIn the SOFC stack model for power systems simulation proposed
by Padulles et al. [229], some limits of the plant were mentioned, e.
g. the FU ranging from 70% to 90%. If the FU was lower than 70%, the
cells voltage would rise rapidly, while the cells may suffer from fuel
starvation as well as the permanent damage when the FU was more
than 90%. When the stack voltage was too low, the PCU would lose
synchronism with the network. It was considered that the use of
voltage-current and power-current plots had been revealed as a use-
ful tool to define the safe operating areas associated with the stack
operation.

PStiller et al. [279] proved the feasible methods for safe running of
a simple SOFC/GT hybrid system in case of off-design operation and
load variation. As shown in Fig. 14, a design point was chosen at full
load operation and part-load steady-state characteristic was pre-
sented in the form of performance maps. The variables of shaft
speed, fuel flow rate, and the current were dominant on the system
power. With respect to a constant FU, the part-load operation at low

Pshaft speed and high fuel flow exhibited the presence of unstable
regions, in which the air-to-fuel ratio must be properly increased.
And vice versa, operation at low fuel flow and high shaft speed made
unhealthy regions with quite low SOFC temperature. The operation
line (cf. Fig. 14) which approximates the unstable regime, was pre-
sented as the average SOFC temperature was kept constant within
80(cid:1)100% load range. Below 80% load, temperature feedback control
must be composed to avoid thermal runaway. Manipulating the fuel
flow, rather than the shaft speed, was more recommended to per-
form a quick load change.

PIn order to get the safe and efficient operation, Wu [281] pointed
out that the system parameters should be stable at ideal levels. In
her work, the ideal values of FU, SOFC working temperature, and TIT
were set to 85%, 1200 K and 1113 K, respectively. In addition, the sin-
gle cell voltage, SCR, and gas turbine speed were also considered.
According to the operation characteristics of SOFC/GT system, Li
[282] calculated a safe operation region, which considered the

Panalysis is the typical and powerful approach in literature to analyze
the performance-parameter relevance. As the parameters of the sys-
tem are coupled, when one or more considered parameters are
changed, the parameters with or without considerations may be
changed or even beyond the scope of the safe operation region. As a
result, the system efficiency may be reduced or it even leads to
unstable operation of the system. The key parameters include
manipulated variables, like fuel/air temperature, pressure, and mass
flow rates, current, etc., and also controlled variables, like power,
efficiency, temperatures of components, safety margins, and so
forth. Among them, the most significant variables are fuel/air
flow rates and SOFC current, or in another word the fuel and air
utilization.

PThe fuel utilization (FU) and air utilization (AU) are the ratios of
the stoichiometric fuel/air flow rate with respect to the SOFC current
to the actual gas flow rates. At a given electric load, the constant FU
or AU is equivalent to the constant fuel or air flow rate. For a stand-
alone SOFC reactor, the high FU will increase the activation overpo-
tential, rapidly increase the internal temperature of the cell and pro-
mote the thermal cracking. When the FU is significantly high, it will
cause “hunger” of the cell and even permanent damage to the cell.
As the SOFC stack is cooled by excessive air flow, the lower AU
means the stronger cooling and vice versa. The FU has a significant
influence on the system efficiency and is also closely related to the
operating cost of the system. At the lower FU, more fuel out of the
anode is chemically burned in the combustor (rather than electro-
chemically reacted in fuel cells) and the power generation efficiency
of the system will decrease. As the stack and GT are strongly coupled
in hybrid systems, FU and AU not only simply mean the gas flow
rates, but also significantly influence the fuel/air inlet temperature,
the SOFC temperature (therefore the SOFC current), TIT, turbine out-
let temperature, etc. The low FU will also reduce recycled vapor con-
tent of the anode and increase the TIT, which may cause carbon
deposition and surge of the compressor. For a simple part-load oper-
ation strategy of running the hybrid system at constant air flow rate
(i.e. lower AU at lower electric load), a global decrease of all the com-
ponent temperatures take place due to the overcooling effect.

PCostamagna et al. [117] addressed the design and off-design anal-
ysis of a hybrid system, coupling of an MGT (about 50 kW) with an
SOFC reactor (about 250 kW). The layout of the hybrid system is sim-
ilar to that of the SWPC demonstration system. The different behav-
iors of the SOFC reactor at off-design conditions were presented for
two cases. In the first case, i.e. the SOFC reactor temperature was
fixed, the cell efficiency versus cell power and the cell power versus
current density showed a parabolic profile. In the second case, i.e.
the SOFC reactor temperature was evaluated on the basis of the com-
plete reactor heat transfer analysis, the corresponding curves were
different due to the strong influence of the cell temperature on the
electrical resistance, the air utilization factor, etc. The off-design sys-
tem performance had been further analyzed with respect to the
fixed or variable MGT rotational speed. At fixed rotational speed, the
system performance was considered to be limited only by the mini-
mum TIT and SOFC temperature, while the MGT always operates
near its design point, and at part load the compressor surge margin
increases. As a result, the off-design system efficiency decreases
from 61% at the design point to 56.4% at 70% of the nominal power.
At variable MGT rotational speed, it was possible to obtain very high
efficiency also at very low part load conditions, i.e. the efficiency
was always higher than 50%, also at 30% nominal power. In all runs,
the air utilization factor and the cell temperature could be variable,
anyway, the fuel utilization factor was always kept constant. Besides
on the system efficiency, the MGT variable speed control also
affected the power ratio between MGT and SOFC, i.e. it is about 20%
at the design point and increases at part load when using fixed rota-
tional speed, and decreases from 20 to 15% when the variable rota-
tional speed control was used.

ation of a sub MW SOFC/GT hybrid system. Adapted from Stiller et al. [279].

PTIT < 1273 K, combustion chamber temperature (Tcomb < 1573 K),
SM > 0.15, SOFC operating temperature (1023 K < T < 1373 K), as
well as the relative speed of gas turbine (0.47 < Ncr < 1.12). Liu [283]
studied the part-load performance of SOFC/MGT hybrid system.
Detail limitations for system safe operation were considered, includ-
ing the SOFC operating temperature which was not lower than 700 °
C, TIT did not exceed 850 °C, and the constant of SCR and fuel effi-
ciency. With the change of cell output power, the best fuel utilization
was taken to be 0.89(cid:1)0.92.

PZhang et al. [284] studied a 5 kW SOFC system with consideration
of the cooperative control of the safe operation and system efficiency
during load tracking. The bypass valve was introduced to adjust the
temperature and efficiency. Meanwhile, a horizontal optimization
process was proposed to achieve maximum efficiency based on ther-
mal safety. Furthermore, the time delay caused by fuel depletion was
also considered. According to the experimental data and experimen-
tal platform practice, the range of corresponding parameters were
considered e.g. TIT was lower than 1273 K, the PEN plate tempera-
ture gradient was no more than 8 K cm¡1 and the working tempera-
ture ranged from 873 K to 1173 K, and the difference between the
inlet air and fuel temperatures was less than 200 K.

PSharifzadeh et al. [285] recently studied the integrating energy
efficiency and operational safety of SOFC triple combined-cycle
power generation systems. As for the safety constraints and physical
limitations in their multi-objective optimization program, the TIT
was maintained below 1550 K and the TSOFC was maintained below
1440 K to avoid thermal shock and thermal degradation, the SM was
kept larger than 10%, the SCR was maintained above 2, the fuel utili-
zation was maintained in the range of 75(cid:1)90%, the minimum cell
voltage was considered as 0.52 V, and the maximum current density
was limited to 5000 A m¡2.

4.3. Part-load and off-design operation

PAs a stand-alone power plant, the power output of a SOFC/GT
hybrid system should be able to adjust quickly to follow the load
demand. This means that the hybrid system will generally work at
off-design and part-load conditions. The first and second law of ther-
modynamics has been usually used in the analysis of steady-state
performance, especially energy efficiency and exergy destruction,
and also system optimization and analysis from thermal, economic,
and environmental points of view [286(cid:1)290].

PSimilar to the analysis of safe operation region, which is focused
on the boundaries of safe/unsafe issues, a study on part-load and off-
design operation pays more attention to the optimal steady-state
and transient performance within the safe regime. Parametric

PMagistri et al. [291] modeled design and off-design operation of
Rolls-Royce IP-SOFC pressurized hybrid systems on the power scale
of 250 kW(cid:1)20 MW. An in-house general purpose transient system
analysis code (TRANSEO code) was developed and embedded in Mat-
lab/Simulink environment. Two different cases, at fixed or variable
gas turbine rotational speed were reproduced for off-design opera-
tions. For part-load runs at the fixed gas turbine rotational speed,
the constant fuel utilization was kept and the airflow rate was inde-
pendent to regulate the operating temperature of SOFC as near as
possible to the design value. In this case, the GT always operates
near its design point and the compressor surge margin increases at
part load, the performance of the hybrid system was limited by the
minimum TIT and SOFC temperature. The part-load simulation
showed the fundamental importance of control strategy of variable
turbine rotational speed for operating the plant at high efficiency
even if at low part-load conditions (50% of the nominal power), as
shown in Fig. 15. However, in consideration of the compressor surge
margin, it is necessary to decrease the TIT and consequently all the
temperatures in the plant, which will greatly reduce the system effi-
ciency. In the case of large hybrid system (20 MW), where the vari-
able speed control is not applicable, bypassing the fuel cell was
recommended to keep the operating temperature in the rage of the
efficient and safe operating point. Two different fuel-cell bypasses
ware considered: upstream and downstream from the recuperator.
Further, the influence of the ambient conditions had also been inves-
tigated. To avoid the operating temperature rise or fall due to varia-
tion of the ambient temperature, bypassing control was also
introduced: when the ambient temperature is lower than the design
value, a part of the airflow bypasses the fuel cell, but if the ambient
temperature is higher it is necessary to bypass the cold side of the
recuperator.

PCalise et al. [292] presented a full- and part-load energy and
exergy analysis of a hybrid SOFC/GT power plant. Thermodynamic
chemical and electrochemical models of main components were
included. Maps were introduced and properly scaled to evaluate the
partial load performance of a centrifugal compressor (based on
ASME 95-GT-79 map) and a radial turbine (based on NASA-CR-
174646 map). A maximum electrical efficiency of 65.4% was
achieved at full-load operation. In order to avoid the control strategy
of the variable rational GT speed, three different part-load strategies
were introduced: (A) constant air mass flow rate, variable fuel flow
rate, no combustor bypass (i.e. no fuel was bypassed to the combus-
tor); (B) constant air to fuel mass flow rate ratio, no combustor
bypass; (C) constant air mass flow rate, variable fuel flow rate, and
combustor bypass. In addition to the three control items, GT bypass

Pfactor (i.e. air bypass ratio for the high-temperature recuperator)
was automatically handled by the simulation code in order to match
the constraints about the maximum cell temperature and the maxi-
mum TIT. Results showed that the strategy of constant air/fuel mass
flow rate ratio won the most efficient part-load operation and that
the strategy of constant air mass flow rate can reach the lowest part-
load operation, by reducing the fuel mass flow rate. A further optimi-
zation procedure was recommended by introducing the turboma-
chinery design with the optimum values of map scaling factors.

PCampanari [293] implemented a thermodynamic investigation
on the integration of the SOFC/GT system, with the objective of
ultra-high electric efficiency, small capacity and the possibility of
heat cogeneration. Some assumptions were introduced, e.g. the min-
imum temperature difference on the recuperator was set to 45 °C
and the combustor outlet temperature was set to 900 °C. The mutual
dependence of the involved variables, which are the current density,
the air utilization, and the cell module exhaust temperature, were
discussed. Two different techniques for cell power reduction (part-
load operation) had been considered: (a) at constant air flow, which
is suitable for matching the gas turbine operation at constant speed,
almost constant air flow and reduced TIT, (b) at constant air utiliza-
tion, which is suitable for matching the gas turbine operation at
reduced speed, reduced mass flow and constant TIT. The partial load
analysis demonstrated the possibility of high-efficiency operation
even at reduced plant electrical output, exploiting the fuel cell char-
acteristic performance improvement at low current densities and
MGT variable-speed optimization.

PChan et al. [256] presented the full-load and part-load analysis on
an IRSOFC/GT system, which consists of two C/T units, two recupera-
tors, an external combustor and a HRSG. The b line model was used
for fitting the DLR centrifugal compressor map and the NASA-CR-
174646 axial turbine map. A good full-load performance was
achieved with a net electrical efficiency of 60% and a total system
efficiency of 80%. A new approach was proposed for system start-up
and part-load operational control, in which the external combustor
plays a critical role, In particular, the part-load operation incorpo-
rates the inherent properties of the SOFC/GT hybrid system by
adjusting the system power output through bypassing part of the
fuel to the combustor. This strategy enhances the condition of the
GT and hence improves the part-load system performance.

PKomatsu et al. [294] studied numerically the performance of
SOFC/MGT hybrid system under the part-load operation. The analy-
sis code there included a distributed-parameter model of the cell
stack module for comprehensive energy balance, electrochemical
process, and fuel reformation process. It was made evident that the

Ppower generation efficiency of the hybrid system decreases together
with the power output. The major reason for the performance degra-
dation was the operating temperature reduction in the SOFC mod-
ule, which was caused by decreasing the fuel supply and the heat
generation in the cells, and also connected to the air flow rate sup-
plement. The variable rotational speed technique of the MGT was
employed as the part-load operation mode, at the same time, the
fuel utilization factor was kept constant. The variable MGT rotational
speed control requires flexible air flow regulations to maintain the
SOFC operating temperature, meanwhile, it leads to high-efficiency
operation of the hybrid system. In the power output range from
100% to 60%, the power generation efficiency was kept over 50%
(LHV). Furthermore, the performance characteristics of the whole
system strongly depended on the SOFC performance, and the tem-
perature gradient in the electrolyte and electrodes of the cell tended
to be larger as the load factor was decreased.

PYang et al. [295] studied the part-load performance of a SOFC/GT
hybrid system in three different control modes: only fuel flow con-
trol, air flow control by rotational GT speed or/and variable inlet
guide vane (VIGV). In fuel-only control mode, air supply was main-
tained constant and fuel supply was manipulated. The latter two
modes simultaneous manipulated both air and fuel flow, so they can
maintain the cell temperature and TIT as high as possible, while
reducing the relative amount of power generated by the GT in part-
load cases. Among the three control modes, the rotational speed
control harvested the best part-load performance, and the VIGV con-
trol mode can be a good option for large-scale systems in which the
turbine works at constant rational speed. Yang et al. [296] further
discussed the hot air bypass (HAB) or cold air bypass (CAB) control
modes for part-load operations. Compared to the rotational speed
control and VIGV control modes, the air-bypass modes combined
with fuel control can extend the system operation range, although it
reduces the system efficiency somehow. These work demonstrated
the significance of GT, working as a relatively smaller power source
in the hybrid system.

PBakalis and Stamatis [297] implemented an exergetic study on
the full- and part-load operation of a SOFC/GT hybrid system. The
SOFC stack was the SWPC TSOFC configuration and the data for MGT
was taken from Capstone C30 single-shaft gas turbine. In the com-
mercial package of AspenPlusۛ, the Rgibbs reactor and the separator
block Sep were used to simulate the anode and cathode components,
respectively. Similar to the exergetic analysis from Calise et al. [287],
the irreversibilities and thermodynamic inefficiencies of the system
were evaluated by examining the full and partial load performance
with the amount of exergy destruction and the exergetic efficiency
of the main components. Results showed that the SOFC stack and
the burner were the devices with the higher exergy destruction rate,
and the recuperator showed lower exergetic efficiency. At full load
operation, the system achieved an exergetic efficiency of 59.8%.
Unlike the first law analysis, in which operations at the design point
has got higher energy efficiency, the second law showed that the
system works more efficiently at part-load conditions due to the
smaller irreversibilities, as a variable MGT speed control method
was utilized. The exergetic system performance was affected signifi-
cantly by the stack temperature.

PNote that the system configuration has a significant influence on
off-design performance with respect to the variation of parameters.
Different system layouts could result in different profiles, in the
amount or even in the trend, of parametric analysis. Saebea et al.
[298] recently studied a SOFC/GT hybrid system with a steam
reformer of ethanol. Two kinds of system layouts were presented:
one is with the recuperative heat exchanger (RHE), the other is with
the cathode gas recirculation (CGR). The parametric analysis shows
that the higher FU leads to the higher SOFC electric efficiency, lower
TIT and lower GT to SOFC power ratio in both systems. However, the
RHE system is more sensitive to the variation of FU. The system

Pefficiency of the RHE system decreases and that of the CGR system
increases with the increasing FU, as the increased SOFC efficiency in
the RHE system cannot compensate the decreased GT output, but
the CGR system can. The FU also significantly influence the required
recuperator effectiveness and cathode recirculation ratio of the RHE
and CGR system, respectively. On the other hand, the GT to SOFC
power ratio in the CGR system shows higher sensitivity to the cur-
rent variation, than that in the RHE system.

4.4. Dynamic modeling

PThe dynamic operation of hybrid system means the off-design
runs with a variation of time. There is a close relationship between
the dynamic analysis and control strategies/controller design. In the
aspect of the transient behaviors of fuel cell and system, there are
multi-scale time constants relevant to the phenomena of electro-
chemical reaction, mechanical rotation, mass and heat transfer. The
objective of transient modeling is up to the characteristic time con-
stants to be interested in. For example, the dynamics of the electric
double layer should be included for a fundamental study on electro-
chemistry. For process control of fuel cell system, the time constants
in the range of 10¡1 s (cid:1)101 s are often taken into account, which is
the typical frequency domain of processes of manifold filling/releas-
ing, movements of flow-control devices and variation of mechanical
revolution, etc. [273,299]. At this point, the fast dynamics of electro-
chemical reaction and transport in the electrodes are usually
neglected in the control-oriented models, and the solid temperature
can be considered constant in cases of the fast process of flow con-
trol. Bhattacharyya and Rengaswamy [300] discussed the dynamics
of the electrode kinetics and charge transfer in double layer, the
mass, and energy transport dynamics of SOFC systems with reform-
ers, which have characteristic time constants in the order of millisec-
onds, seconds, minutes or hours, respectively. Furthermore, the
transient behavior of the hybrid system is also significantly influ-
enced, or even dominated by the dynamics of balancing compo-
nents, like acceleration or deceleration of the GT, the thermal inertia
of the recuperator and heat exchangers, and so on. In order to study
the dynamic characteristics of the system, parametric analysis, e.g.
step changes of fuel flow and electric current, as well as variable
speed operation of the gas turbine when keeping the constant SOFC
operating temperature, are generally utilized.

PWith the in-house TRANSEO code, Magistri et al. [291] considered
in detail the time-variant behaviors of chemical reactive flow. The
1D approach was used in the along-the-channel stack model and the
axial heat exchanger model to capture the spatial profile of the main
transient phenomena during the transient process. For simplifica-
tion, the MSRR and WGSR were assumed to be equilibrium (rather
than the chemical kinetics) within the anodic flow and the current
distribution was not considered among all the cells of the module. In
addition to 0D models of turbomachinery, the thermal storage in the
walls of the turbomachinery was included, which was thought to be
significant during start-up and shut-down process. A preliminary
time-dependent investigation of a pressurized hybrid system behav-
ior was presented with response to a fueling step. Corresponding to
a 10% reduction in the fuel ejector nozzle total pressure, the anode-/
significant
cathode-side pressure difference demonstrates
increase, and the SOFC inlet SCR shows an oscillation. Since the GT
rotational speed and the fuel utilization were kept to be constant,
the cathodic-side transient behavior was dominated by temperature
variation, while the anodic-side was driven by three different time-
scale phenomena, i.e. the very fast fluid dynamic delay (less than
one second), the pressurization/depressurization delay (about 100
seconds), and the long-term thermal inertia (about 300 seconds).

Plocated at the NFCRC. The CSTR approach with reforming and shift
reaction rates was used for bulk modeling of SOFC. The gas com-
pressibility and mass storage were considered in transient models of
compressor and expander. The transient system model was vali-
dated well by the experimental start-up process. Besides the control
of SOFC load and fuel flow, the recuperator bypass and the SOFC
bypass was set to manipulate the air temperature and mass flow at
the inlet of SOFC, respectively. Due to the configuration of dual-shaft
turbines in SWPC system, the total air mass flow rate was decoupled
with the SOFC load, and the SOFC bypass plays an important role in
turbine speed (i.e. mass flow) control. Corresponding to a fall of
SOFC power, the SOFC bypass valve responded quickly in the experi-
mental system to bypass more air across the SOFC.

PIn Matlab/Simulink environment, a transient model for the opti-
mization of a SOFC/GT hybrid system was proposed by Barelli et al.
[302]. With the aim to guarantee a certain inertia of the system and
evaluate the system global performance (efficiency, time response),
a right dimensioning of the main plant components, with particular
attention to the heat exchangers, were carried out. The interaction
between the system components was investigated during transients,
especially the inertial effect of gas turbine and heat exchangers on
the fuel cell. The transfer functions based on Laplace's transform
were used for transient modeling of the main components. The
results showed that, in case of GT load following conditions, SOFC
current delivery was affected by a non-negligible delay and SOFC
transient behavior was influenced by the delays of its inputs (cath-
ode input air, H2 flow rate). The cathode inlet air was characterized
by a significant thermal delay, which was of about 4500(cid:1)5500 s,
respectively for load steps of 14.5 and 21.5 kW (starting from a load
base at 22.5 kW). A proper design of the heat recovery section to per-
form a plant optimization was proposed at the same time.

4.5. Load following

PThe load following is a specific topic of dynamic characteristics.
To be subjected to a frequent variation of power demand which is
determined by consumers’ demand, knowledge of dynamic behavior
and strategies of load following have been paid much attention, in
operation of both stand-alone power plant and power sources
embedded in the power grid. From the point of thermodynamic sys-
tem and process control, different structures of GT (e.g. single-shaft,

Pdual-shaft), different system layouts (e.g. w/ or w/o external
reformer, configuration of burners and/or bypass valves, size match
between SOFC and GT generator, etc.), different control strategies (e.
g. constant SOFC operating temperature, fixed/variable GT speed,
etc.) and controller designs were taken into account. From the per-
spective of power system, control of power electronics was generally
introduced, e.g. adjusting the modulation coefficient and phase shift
of the inverter, changing the trigger angle to regulate the active
power, tie-line mismatches to adjust generator set points, configur-
ing the energy storage units to store electricity in the off-peak and
discharge during peak period and auxiliary circuit branches, etc.

PMueller et al. [303] studied the load following process for a 5 kW
simple cycle SOFC system, which consists of six primary compo-
nents: a SOFC stack, steam reformer, steam preparation boiler, com-
bustor, heat exchangers, and blower. A detailed quasi-2D integrated
dynamic system model was used to resolve the physics of mass/heat
transfer, chemical kinetics, and electrochemistry within the system.
As shown in Fig. 16(a), a baseline control strategy was first designed
to meet the system power demand and maintain the SOFC operating
requirements, which includes six features: (1) manipulate current to
follow the system power demand, (2) manipulate fuel flow to main-
tain fuel utilization, (3) provide water from steam preparation boiler
to maintain a high SCR, (4) manipulate cold air bypass the heat
exchangers to maintain the fuel cell inlet temperature, (5) manipu-
late the cathode airflow rate by the variable speed blower to main-
tain the SOFC temperature, and (6) limit the amount of current
drawn to assure that electrochemically active fuel species are not
depleted in the SOFC and that the cell voltage remains at reasonable
values. Corresponding to an instantaneous system load demand
increase from 2 to 5 kW, the simulation results showed that the
baseline control design produced a SOFC system with very effective
dynamic load following capability. However, in the baseline control-
ler, it brought the tradeoff problem between hydrogen depletion
and the combustor temperature blower parasitic power. Considering
that the air flow rate cannot increase as fast as the fuel flow rate
without affecting the system power, a new approach of the combus-
tor temperature controller was designed to manipulate the fuel cell
current to control the combustor inlet stoichiometry. To limit the
effect of the blower power demand on load following, varying the
fuel cell current will vary the amount of hydrogen consumed, which
will affect the amount of hydrogen entering the combustor and thus

Pthe combustor temperature. The integrated novel control scheme
was shown in Fig. 16(b). With a faster power output, the simulation
results showed that the novel control was more effective at mitigat-
ing reformer flow delay effects on the system than the baseline con-
troller. In both control strategies, due to the reformer flow delay, the
hydrogen depletion in the anode limits fundamentally the SOFC sys-
tem load following capability. The authors also suggested some
approaches to improve load following capability of SOFC system, e.g.
configuration of external power sources, variable fuel utilization for
more hydrogen storage in the anode compartment (if the transient
load is predictable), and fully internal reforming inside the anode
compartment.

PBased on finite-volume discretization model of SOFC, Oh and
Sun [304] examined the load following issues and optimal opera-
tion a TSOFC/GT system with a rated power of 5 kW served as APU
for military and commercial applications. Two distinct SOFC/GT
designs, i.e. single-shaft and dual-shaft design, were discussed. The
steady-state optimal set points for current density, fuel flow rate,
and generator load were firstly achieved as a function of load, and
they were found to be on the boundary of the feasible operation
region. When the optimal set points used as goals for load transi-
tions, some advanced control algorithm is essential to manage the
sensitive system dynamics. Corresponding to a load step from
4.7 kW to 5.7 kW, the open-loop response showed that the single-
shaft system ended up in air hunger and shut-down condition if
there is no a rate limiter to slow down the aggressive load change,
while the double-shaft system showed a more robust performance
without such a vicious running. Correspondingly, sensitivity study
on various combinations of the three control inputs, fuel flow, SOFC
current and generator load, had been performed. The combination
of fuel flow and SOFC current control, and the combination of fuel
flow and generator load control were thought to be suitable for sin-
gle-shaft and dual-shaft system, respectively. The results demon-
strated the potential of leveraging multivariable control to achieve
fast load following while satisfying operational constraints such as
the maximum cell temperature, constant TIT, and GT speed. How-
ever, the detailed control strategy and controller design were not
included.

PIn the conventional recuperating-SOFC/GT (R-SOFC/GT) design,
the SOFC works as the primary power sources (contributes 80% of
the total power), as a result, the load-following performance is lim-
ited by the SOFC slow thermal dynamics. Jia et al. [305] proposed a
system layout by augmenting an energy storage unit (e.g., battery)
and a dual operating generator/motor (G/M). Taking full advantage
of the bi-directional operation of G/M, i.e (a) pre-conditioning of the
generator power for load step-up transients; (b) absorbing the
excessive power by motoring operation for load step-down transi-
ents, trade-offs between power tracking and thermal management
was achieved, power and energy requirements for the battery was
reduced, and overall system performance was enhanced. Further-
more, a concept of sprinter-SOFC/GT (S-SOFC/GT) system was pro-
posed by Jia et al. [306]. In the S-SOFC/GT design, the SOFC is
downsized (the generator power could be up to 80% of the SOFC
power) to work as a baseline power source, and therefore it was
designed to take full advantage of the rapid dynamic capability of
the GT-generator. A procedure was designed for size configuration
and baseline operation of the system. For a big step from the base-
line load to the peak load, a PI-type shaft speed control was designed
to stabilize the S-SOFC/GT system, and also the substantial FU varia-
tion (90% » 50% from baseline power to peak power) was adopted to
get the desired air flow, burner temperature and therefore the gen-
erator power tracking. Then a first-order transfer function was
applied to alleviate the power tracking error and the over-aggressive
adjustment of the air flow in the PI-type shaft speed control. Over
the entire load range for mobile applications, the SOFC can be kept
stable with power variation less than 2% and temperature variation

Pless than 2 K, and the compressor surge margin was safely kept
above 5(cid:1)10%.

PLi and Tomsovic, et al.

investigated some possible
[307]
approaches to load following at the distribution level (such as fuel
cells, MGT, and energy storage devices). A three-phase power flow
algorithm which is essentially a Gauss-Seidel approach was pro-
posed. Different from the traditional load following and regulation
functions, the authors proposed a similar concept for distribution
systems that neglects frequency deviation and considered only tie-
line mismatches to adjust generator set points. With the energy stor-
age capacitor (ECS) responding to faster load fluctuations, the slower
response MGT can manage to track the load. Zhu and Tomsovic
[308] presented the dynamic model and evaluated the stand-alone
dynamic performances of a distribution system embedded with a
split-shaft MGT plant and a SOFC power plant. Similar to the SOFC
dynamic model of Padulles et al. [229], in which the electrochemical
and thermodynamic process in SOFC were approximated by first-
order transfer functions, the chemical process in the fuel processor
was represented simply by a first-order lag model of the time con-
stant. The split-shaft MGT was modeled as a simple-cycle, single-
shaft one with the GAST governor model without the droop. Corre-
sponding to 5% load increase of the base load, the MGT picked up the
major increase in the load and reached the peak output much faster
than the SOFC and the tie-line flow. Different from the MGT with a
PI controller for real power control, the authors had not presented
any analysis on how the SOFC was to be controlled (except for con-
stant fuel utilization).

PBased on the work of Padulles et al. [229] and Zhu and Tomsovic
[308], Li et al. [309] studied the load-following service of a SOFC
power plant with a fuel processor in an isolated system. A feasible
operating area was introduced to correlate the stack voltage
fuel utilization (0.7(cid:1)0.9), and stack current
(0.95(cid:1)1.05 p.u.),
(0.1(cid:1)1.1 p.u.). Two kinds of control strategies, i.e. constant fuel utili-
zation and constant voltage, were introduced for load tracking.

PTo utilize the linear control theory, the model was further simpli-
fied through the small-signal analysis of the nonlinear system. For
constant fuel utilization control, the input hydrogen fuel was set to
be in proportion to the stack current, and a pulse-width-modulation
(PWM) inverter in the PCU was thought to be able to easily handle
the resulting small change of voltage on the FC terminals. For con-
stant voltage control, an additional external voltage-control loop
was incorporated by a PI controller, and the stack current feedback
used in the constant fuel utilization control scheme was still
included in this instance to mitigate the disturbance that originates
upstream of the stack. Both the simulation results in the two control
modes showed the feasibility of using a SOFC-based distributed gen-
eration as a slow-acting energy source.

PAccounting for thermal dynamics and cell polarizations, Sed-
ghisigarchi and Feliachi [310] developed a lumped SOFC model in
MATLAB and incorporated it with a power system stability analysis
package called the power analysis toolbox (PAT). Corresponding to
the step change of load and fuel flow in a stand-alone SOFC plant,
the SOFC dynamics were simulated in terms of the stack voltage
response. Simulation results showed that stack temperature
dynamics plays an important role in dc output voltage level and
that temperature and species dynamics is negligible for very fast
load change. Then the dynamics of SOFC-based distributed systems
were analyzed to boost the system stability with proper control of
the SOFC [311]. Fuel-cell power/voltage control actions were
through the PCU specifically: 1) Power control: done by adjusting
the firing angle of the PWM inverter for fast transient variations.
2) Voltage control: done by adjusting the modulation index of the
dc/dc converter, which affects the magnitude of the converter out-
put voltage. The one-megawatt load was represented by an imped-
ance load. Two cases of load tracking were simulated, the first was
with only GTs, and the second was with both GT and SOFC. When

Pall the distributed generators were gas turbines with different
time constants, the smaller GT can respond quickly to the load dis-
turbance and can increase the output quickly in order to supply
power to buses. However, the frequency drop was more than 13%,
which is outside the standard limits. When the SOFC and GTs were
integrated, by setting suitable voltage PI controller gains, simula-
tion results showed that it can help control frequency fluctuations
(the frequency drop was less than 1%), and supply power after
system islanding. Also, it was suggested that the grid-connected
fuel cell needs to have a battery as an auxiliary energy source or
storage.

PKandepu et al. [312] proposed a load-following simulation of an
autonomous power system constituted with SOFCs and GTs. A
dynamic, lumped SOFC model was described for control-oriented
study. Compared to a distributed transient SOFC model, the one-vol-
ume model can cover the dominant time-variant behaviors, while a
two-volume model was proposed to get the spatial characteristics
of important variables. All the system components, including SOFC,
GT, and synchronous generator, were modeled in the commercial
package, gPROMS. Four types of loads were categorized as constant
current, constant impedance, and constant power and induction
motor. For the load-tracking scenario, a PI-type controller was
designed for constant FU and constant SOFC operating temperature.
Correspondingly, the fuel flow rate and the air blow off at the com-
pressor outlet were selected as manipulated variables for FU and
SOFC temperature control, respectively. The control structure with
PI controllers showed satisfactory results during the load change,
however, several effects were not considered, e.g. anti-surge and TIT
constraints, optimal air-blow-off utilization, and single-shaft GT
design.

4.6. Control strategies and controller designs

P4.6.1. Control strategies

PThe control strategies mean how to select the control objectives
under constraints and determine the corresponding control input
variables for a transient operation. Different emphases, e.g. trade-off
between performance optimization and system complexity and cost,
usually formulate different control plans. For example, a constant GT
speed strategy provides a simple and low-cost air control, while a
variable GT speed strategy leads to a more efficient part-load opera-
tion of the turbomachinery and the hybrid system. Generally speak-
ing, the control strategies can be classified by the type of controlled
variables (CV) and/or manipulated variables (MV) of the SOFC/GT
hybrid system,

P(1) Electrical variables,

including SOFC current density, voltage,
SOFC power and generator power, and also variables of the
power grid and power electronics, etc. Correspondingly, there
are constant voltage control, current control (when the SOFC
current drawn can be treated as a MV, rather than a disturbance
variable fully determined by the users), power distribution
between SOFC and generator, etc.

P(2) Thermodynamic and hydrodynamic variables, including fuel/air
flow rate, fuel utilization, fuel/air pressure, fuel/air inlet and out-
let temperature, SOFC temperature, TIT, combustor temperature,
reformer temperature, SCR, etc. Correspondingly, there are
constant/float FU control, fuel/air flow control, fuel/air flow tem-
perature, constant SOFC temperature control, combustor tem-
perature control, temperature gradient control, anodic/cathodic
pressure difference control, etc.

P(3) Mechanical variables, including the GT rotational speed, bypass
opening, etc. Correspondingly, there are fixed/variable GT speed
control, variable inlet guide vane control, air bypass valve con-
trol, fuel bypass valve control, etc.

PA proper control strategy is essentially combination of several
above-mentioned controls. Table 9 summarized some representative
control studies proposed for SOFC/GT hybrid system. [313(cid:1)340]

PPower tracking of SOFC/GT hybrid system, as a power source, can
be considered the only or ultimate goal of its control. For SOFC
power control, the SOFC current was often taken as the MV
[301,303,313,316,317,319,324,328] or as a disturbance, at the same
time, the cell voltage or the convertor voltage [311,329] can be kept
constant [309,320(cid:1)323,326(cid:1)328,331,334,337,338] or vary within a
safe range. Manipulating the power ratio between SOFC and GT is
also an effective strategy of load following of the hybrid system, in
some cases, the generator load [306,313,319] or the power ratio
between SOFC and GT [317] was directly used as the MV for the GT
speed control. Correspondingly, process control of fuel/air flow
(mass flow rates, temperature, and pressure) of the hybrid system,
as a chemical reactor, are the fundamental means for a safe opera-
tion under power demand. Stiller et al. [279] directly proposed the
operation lines, describing the relative net power as a function of
the relative fuel flow and the relative shaft speed (i.e. the relative air
flow). Some researcher also directly took the CV/MV pair of power/
fuel flow rate [256,279,292,306,320] or power/air flow rate [293].

PConstant FU control is the most used strategy for fuel flow control

[117,223,291,294(cid:1)296,309,312(cid:1)314,316(cid:1)319,323(cid:1)328,330,331,
333(cid:1)336,338]. The constant FU means to keep the mass flow rate of
fuel proportional to the SOFC current, with regard to variation of the
current and fuel composition. The current-based fuel control pro-
posed by Mueller et al. [217] is just the constant FU control. The
strategy of constant FU was also discussed in the National Energy
Technology Laboratory (NETL) control mode of
the MCFC/GT
hybrid system [315]. As a simple and fast way to ensure a proper
excess of fuel flow rate for power output, the constant FU strategy
feedforward controller designs
has been widely used for
[223,303,309,313(cid:1)316,318,319].

POn the other hand, the variable or float FU could be an effective
strategy for fuel flow control. In the S-SOFC/GT design, Jia et al. [306]
proposed a substantial FU variation (90% » 50% from the baseline
load to the peak load) to get the desired air flow, burner temperature
and therefore the generator power tracking. When the control of
combustor or burner temperature is introduced, variable or float FU
is often available if considers the ratio of the consumed fuel rate to
the total fuel flow rate (not the anode inlet fuel flow rate). Mueller
et al. [303] proposed the approach of the combustor temperature
control to manipulate the SOFC current, i.e. the amount of hydrogen
consumed, to control the combustor inlet stoichiometry. They also
suggested the strategy of variable FU for more hydrogen storage in
the anode compartment to improve load following capability. Calise
et al. [292] presented the strategies of variable fuel flow and with/
without fuel bypassed to the combustor. Chan et al. [256] proposed
the external combustor control for part-load operation, by adjusting
the system power output through bypassing part of the fuel to the
combustor. Mueller et al. [316] and Wu et al. [324] also introduced
the TIT control loop by manipulating fuel flow bypass to the burner.
Roberts et al. [315] compared and validated the NETL/NFCRC control
modes for MCFC/GT hybrid system, in which the NFCRC mode actu-
ally adopted the float FU as that the fuel flow was manipulated to
maintain the burner temperature by a PI controller.

Pthe air flow rate and temperature through recirculation, bypass or
variable mass flow turbomachinery. Proposed strategies for air con-
trol mainly include fixed/variable GT shaft speed, air bypass, variable
inlet guide vanes (VIGV), etc. Cathode recirculation is also an effec-
tive way to control the cathode air flow, although it requires addi-
tional actuators of blowers [319] or variable flow ejectors [341].
Compressor bleed or air blow off [312] was also used in some partic-
ular instances to increase the stall/surge margin and alleviate mis-
match between the SOFC air flow demands and that supplied by the
compressor.

PGT shaft speed is the most used to manipulate the air flow rate.
Typically, large MW-scale GT with synchronous generators, and
dual-shaft MGT generators with a free turbine and a generator
assembly, are designed to operate at constant speed. Correspond-
ingly, the fixed GT shaft speed was often used as the baseline strat-
egy [117,291,292,293,314],
in which the GT always operates
nears its design point, and at part load the compressor surge
the MGT performance and
margin increases. To improve
therefore the system efficiency at part
the strategy of
speed was adopted by much more studies

load,

Pvariable blower power [303] or manipulation of mass flow controller
downstream the blower [325] were used to get variable air flow rate
for some simple SOFC systems. In the NETL control mode of MCFC/
GT hybrid system, the variable GT speed was also proposed for the
catalytic oxidizer temperature control [315]. Some researchers com-
pared both the fixed and variable speed strategies [117,291,314]. For
the fixed speed cases, additional actuators (cathode bypass or auxil-
iary combustor) were required to maintain the SOFC temperature
and avoid the limitation of the minimum TIT. As trade off, the bypass
control resulted in an unacceptably high oxygen utilization in the
cathode as well as a decreased recuperator temperature, and the
auxiliary combustor resulted in a less efficient system. The variable
GT speed control design can offer a straightforward system design
that meets all operational constraints. Still, additional air controls,
like the air bypass and VIGV, are often introduced to get more
detailed thermal management.

PBy splitting part of flow across a device, air bypass is able to pro-
vide much quicker air flow control than the inertia-affected shaft
speed. Table 10 summarized air bypass at different locations. The
SOFC bypass means to split part of the SOFC inlet air flow across the
SOFC, to the turbine inlet [291,292,296,301,318], or in some cases, to

Pthe burner inlet [306,340]. Across the recuperator, air at the cold side
[303,319] or exhaust gas at the hot side [301,306,318,320] can be
bypassed to adjust the preheated temperature of the air. In the
SWPC demo system, a SOFC bypass valve and a hot-side recuperator
bypass valve (cf. Fig. 12) have been used to control the cathode inlet
air flow rate and temperature, respectively [301]. The GT cold
bypass, splitting part of the air flow at the compressor outlet to the
turbine inlet [291,296,317,319], or in some cases, to the burner
inlet [340], was usually used to directly or indirectly control the TIT,
cathode inlet/outlet temperature, and combustor temperature. The
operation range of air bypass is limited by the opening and also the
thermal stability of bypass valves.

PAdjusting the angle of the VIGV located in front of the compressor
inlet is a simple and fast way for air flow control. The VIGV control
strategy can be a good option for large-scale systems in which the
GT works at constant rational speed, and it can also be applied to
small-scale GT operated at a constant rotational speed [295]. How-
ever, the operation of VIGV is also limited. If the angle of the VIGV is
increased above a certain value (e.g., 40°), it causes the compressor
to stall and limits the gas turbine operation [296]. The range of air
flow reduction from VIGV is typically small, ca. 30%, while the vari-
able GT speed can control air flow over a larger range, ca. 50% [319].
PDifferent control schemes can be proposed with respect to the
same control strategy. Choosing a proper control scheme is an artis-
tic work. There are decentralized and centralized (multivariable cou-
pled) control schemes.

P4.6.2. Decentralized control

PFor a fuel cell power plant, which is typically a MIMO system, the
CVs and MVs are usually coupled, i.e. adjusting a MV can lead to
varying degrees of several CVs and a CV can be adjusted by various
MVs. For example, the cell voltage is the overall outcome of all oper-
ating variables, the TIT can be manipulated by both the air bypass
flow and the supplementary combustor fuel flow. Bhattacharyya and
Rengaswamy [333] studied the MIMO control problem of SOFC, in
which cell power and FU were the two CVs, voltage, and H2 flow
were the two MVs, and therefore it leads to two control options:
[(power, voltage), (FU, H2 flow)] pairs and [(power, H2 flow), (FU,
voltage)] pairs. The first CV/MV pair exhibited a stable operation,
and the second pair made unstable oscillation. For a proper

Pdecentralized control of MIMO system, it is essential to determine
the dominant MV/CV pairs. Control of the single-input single-output
(SISO) and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system was also
considered as decentralized controls in Table 9.

PParametric sensitivity analysis is a simple way to determine
MV/CV pairs. Hajimolana and Soroush [321] studied the transient
responses of voltage, current, and cell temperature with respect to
step variation of § 5% in the velocity, pressure and temperature of
the inlet fuel and air flow. Then the mapping relationship between
the MVs and the CVs was arranged in terms of relative steady-state
gain around the nominal conditions. The air inlet temperature and
the air inlet pressure were therefore selected as the dominant MVs,
because they brought the largest percentage changes in the cell tem-
perature and the cell voltage, respectively. The advantage of the
parametric sensitivity analysis is that computation is implemented
only in the time domain, which is natural for physics-based govern-
ing equations.

PAnalysis of the relative gain array (RGA) of the system substanti-
ates the choice of control structure, by giving insightful nature of
input/output (I/O) pairing for decentralized control. To provide a
measure of the interactions caused by using various I/O pairing
choices, the RGA is a normalization of the transfer function, defined
as [342]

where v is angular frequency, G(v) is the transfer function, £ is the
element-element product. The RGA analysis is implemented in the
frequency domain.

PThen, the RGA number is calculated to measure diagonal domi-
nance as follows, i.e. pairings that have a RGA number close to 0 at
these frequencies are preferred to avoid instabilities due to interac-
tions in the crossover region.

PMueller et al. [316] implemented the RGA analysis of the SOFC/GT
system at several operating points for decentralized control. Four
input variables, i.e. GT load power (u1), supplementary combustor
fuel flow (u2), SOFC current (u3) and anode fuel flow (u4), were
selected as MVs. Five output variables, i.e. GT shaft speed (y1), SOFC

Ptemperature (y2), combustor temperature (y3), system power (y4)
and cell voltage (y5), were selected as CVs. The RGA analysis of two
possible I/O pairings, [(u3, y4), (u4, y5)] and [(u3, y5), (u4, y4)], indi-
cated that the second pairing resulted in a less-coupled system pair-
ing at lower frequencies, but a more-coupled system at higher
frequencies. As a result, the MV/CV pairs of [(SOFC current, system
power), (anode fuel flowrate, cell voltage)] were selected. Sendjaja
and Kariwala et al. [323] proposed the voltage control of SOFC, with
the current disturbance and constraints of FU, anode/cathode pres-
sure difference, and ratio between H2 and O2 flow. Corresponding to
the two MVs, i.e. fuel flow rate (qf) and O2 flow rate (qO2), RGA analy-
sis resulted in much different control scheme for different CV selec-
tions. When the voltage (Vr) and FU were taken as CVs, the RGA
matrix showed a perfect diagonal pairing of [(Vr, qO2), (FU, qf)]. How-
ever, when the measurement combination of voltage, fuel flow rate,
O2 flow rate and current were taken as CVs, the RGA matrix recom-
mended an off-diagonal pairing of [(Vr, qf), (¡ qO2 + 0.98qf, qO2)]. Cao
and Li [325] took the pairing of (FU, H2 flow rate) with respect to the
current disturbance, and implemented the RGA analysis to deter-
mine the paring of [(stack inlet temperature, bypass air flow), (stack
outlet temperature, air flow)]. In their work, the RGA analysis was
similar to the parametric sensitivity analysis by introducing step
changes of MVs in time domain, instead of the standard relative gain
matrix of transfer function in frequency domain.

PThe simplest control scheme is the feedforward (FF). Some stud-
ies [314,318] had just introduced the FF control to improve open-
loop performance. For better close-loop performance, the control
schemes are generally feedback, or combination of feedforward and
feedback. In Table 9, most of the decentralized control designs con-
tain one or two control loops for power and temperature control. As
that the time constants are very different corresponding to different
control issues, e.g. the fast GT speed dynamics and the very slow
thermal dynamics, a multi-loop control strategy for a SOFC/GT
hybrid system was proposed by Stiller et al. [313]. Fig. 17 shows the
control scheme, including SOFC power control, FU control, air flow

Pcontrol and temperature control. The CV/MV pairs were selected as:
[(SOFC power, SOFC current), (FU, fuel flow), (air flow, generator
power, i.e. GT shaft speed), (mean cell temperature measured by
exhaust fuel temperature, air flow set point)]. The interaction among
the control loops made no influence in stability of the system due to
the different in control time scales: SOFC power control in order of
one second, FU control in order of seconds, air flow control in order
of minutes, and temperature control in order of hours. Under this
control scheme, the system operated stably at all the tests with
respect to load following, a variation of ambient air condition, events
of degradation and malfunction.

PMueller et al. [316] proposed a multi-loop and cascade control for
a 275 kW bottoming SOFC/GT hybrid system. The time constants of
interest are those larger than 10 ms. A wide-ranged operation of
15(cid:1)100% nominal power was realized by manipulating the supple-
mentary fuel flow into the combustor and the variable speed of the
GT. According to the power demand, the operating requirements
and limitations were considered as the maximum SOFC temperature
must be < 1073 K, the temperature difference between the cathode
inlet temperature and the fuel cell electrolyte temperature must
be < 200 K, hydrogen must not be depleted in the anode, the com-
bustor temperature must not exceed 1150 K, and the maximum GT
shaft speed is 97,000 rpm. The final system design contained four
main controllers: a system power controller, a cascaded GT shaft
speed/SOFC temperature controller, a combustor temperature con-
troller, and an anode fuel flow controller. To enhance the system
response, the CV of power was paired with SOFC current instead of
fuel flow rate, as that the current-generation time scale is almost
instantaneous, whereas the time scale of species transport is in
the order of seconds. The thermal management controller con-
tained two control loops: (a) a cascade control scheme, in which
a slow outer loop for the SOFC temperature control provides the
set point for a fast inner loop for the GT shaft speed control, (b)
a TIT control loop by manipulating the supplementary fuel flow
into the combustor. To prevent fuel starvation at a constant FU,

Pthe anode fuel flow was supplied proportion to the stack current
as the feedforward control. The final system control design was
found to be robust to ambient temperature and fuel concentra-
tion variations, to have rapid load following capability, and to
have a wide range of system operating power. Based on the simi-
lar control scheme, Wu and Zhu [324] implemented the multi-
loop control of SOFC/GT system, with a different type of control-
ler instead of the standard PID controller. As mentioned previ-
ously, the control scheme proposed for a 5 kW simple cycle SOFC
system was also multi-loop and cascade [303].

PThe control scheme, proposed by Ferrari [317], was based on two
PID and three PI controllers. To control the MGT speed during load
increases, a PID controller was configured to manipulate the frac-
tional opening (FO) of a bypass valve, which has a small FO
(FO D 0.05) at design condition. The power-sharing between the
stack and the turbine was obtained through a sharing-out coefficient
calculated by a slow PI controller, which operates with the objective
of keeping the bypass valve fractional opening at the setpoint posi-
tion. Then a very fast response PID, simulating the inverter control-
ler, calculated the SOFC current with the objective of nullifying the
deviation of power tracking. Fuel was controlled by an apt valve
whose fractional opening was calculated by a slow response PI with
the objective of keeping the FU constant. The last controller was a
very slow response PI in order to calculate the GT speed set point to
keep the SOFC average temperature constant. A comparison of two
different load step decreases and a load step increase was then stud-
ied. With load steps smaller than 5%, limited by the maximum allow-
able step increase for the 5% on-design fractional opening of the
bypass valve, the control system layout was proved to be effective in
good power regulating and safe operation of the pressurized SOFC/
GT hybrid system.

PMcLarty et al. [319] proposed multi-loop schemes for both two
scenarios, the baseline control and the combination of baseline/addi-
tional control of a pressurized hybrid topping cycles. The baseline
control scenario included the minimum combination of power, fuel,
and speed control: a power controller to manipulate the fuel cell
stack current, a fuel controller to maintain fixed fuel utilization as
the current fluctuates, and a generator load controller to maintain
the GT rotational speed. The additional controls: a) post-FC fuel
injection (i.e. injecting supplemental fuel into an anode tail gas oxi-
dizer or a downstream combustor), b) pre-FC fuel injection (i.e. fuel
injection upstream of the anode, which means float FU), c) VIGV con-
trol with blower recirculation control, and d) FC air bypass with
blower recirculation control, were then evaluated. Besides the VIGV
control for SOFC/GT system, the GT speed control was also presented
for MCFC/GT system. A combined feed-forward and cascade PI con-
trol strategy was utilized. The additional controllers realized a high-
efficiency (>65%) and a wide range of power tracking (4:1 and 2:1
turndown ratio for SOFC and MCFC system, respectively), with alle-
viated temperature gradient and surge/stall risk.

PIn addition to the standard PID control, a lot of control algo-
rithms have been used for decentralized controls,
like MPC,
Fuzzy, Neural network, etc. As an attractive option for SOFC sys-
tems, MPC uses a system model and an online optimization to
calculate appropriate actuation commands, and it can directly
handle constraints on both the input and output variables. Fuzzy
and neural network (NN) are kinds of technologies of artificial
intelligence, and therefore provide the ability to handle the non-
linear system. Cao and Li [325] proposed the feedback controllers
with a single neuron adaptive PID algorithm, which has the
advantages of robust control and PID control, can automatically
adjust control parameters when the system encounters uncer-
tainties and disturbances. Based on the Mac-Vicar Whelan rule
base, Sakhare et al. [329] developed the fuzzy logic controllers of
dc/dc converter and dc/ac inverter for stand-alone operation and
grid connection of fuel cells. Wu and Zhu [324] proposed an

Padaptive PID decoupling control scheme for the temperature
control, a MPC scheme for power control, and a single neuron
adaptive PID controller for FU control, respectively. Wu et al.
[326] proposed the MPC algorithm for cell voltage control,
besides that a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)
identification model was used and optimized by the genetic algo-
rithm (GA) was used. As part of a MPC strategy, a fuzzy Ham-
merstein (FH) model was presented by Jurado [328]. The FH
model captured the static nonlinearity with the fuzzy part and
the linear dynamics with an autoregressive with exogenous input
(ARX) model. Huo et al. [327] also proposed a MPC controller
based on a Hammerstein model, in which the nonlinear static
and the linear dynamic part were approximated by a RBFNN and
an ARX model, respectively.

P4.6.3. Centralized control

PA centralized controller has a more optimal and comprehensive
nature to consider the interactions between MVs and CVs than a
decentralized controller. A variety of centralized control approaches
have been proposed for fuel cell systems, ranging from simple linear
state feedback controllers, like LQR, to more advanced control tech-
niques such as MPC, Fuzzy, H-infinity (H1), etc.

PWhen the working point fluctuates near the stable point within a
small scale, the linear control theory is powerful and has been
widely used in nonlinear systems. Mueller et al. [330] proposed a
control study on a bottoming SOFC/GT hybrid system with supple-
mental oxidizer fuel and variable speed GT. With respect to the
control loops of system power, temperature and FU, and also distur-
bances of ambient temperature and fuel composition, the RGA anal-
ysis exhibited their strong coupling in the time scale of interest.
With this regard, based on a reduced-order linearization of the
nonlinear model, the LQR algorithm including state estimation via
Kalman filtering was developed for centralized implementation.
Besides that, the LQR controller was augmented by GT speed control
and also integral system power control with a small integral gain to
eliminate the error of power tracking. For a 20% reduction in the
fuel's methane mole fraction and a 40 °C diurnal temperature pertur-
bation, both the LQR and the decentralized controller exhibited good
performance of power tracking, anyway, the LQR controller mean-
while made the better performance of constraints of cell voltage and
temperature.

PWhen stronger disturbances and uncertainty factors are intro-
duced, the linear controller could be dissatisfactory or even fail due
to nonlinear characteristics of the system. In Table 9, the MPC is the
most used choice for nonlinear centralized control implementation.
Murshed et al. [331] performed both linear and nonlinear MPCs sim-
ulations for the stand-alone fuel cell and the fuel cell/capacitor
hybrid system. For the nonlinear MPC (NMPC) design, the orthogonal
collocation method was used for discretization, and the unscented
Kalman filter was used to estimate unmeasured states. The NMPC
can control the system for larger load disturbances within the sys-
tem design capacity. In all simulation cases, NMPC outperformed lin-
ear MPC with regard to rejection of load disturbance. Yang et al.
[332] proposed a predictive controller based on an improved Taka-
gi(cid:1)Sugeon (T-S) fuzzy model to maintain the stack temperature. In
the predictive control design by Bhattacharyya and Rengaswamy
[333], the nonlinear additive autoregressive with exogeneous input
(NAARX) model was used for system identification. In terms of tran-
sient response to a load step change, the NMPC controller outper-
formed a well-tuned PID controller in the overshoot of power and
FU. To implement MPC for coupled control of power and FU, Sanan-
daji et al. [335] developed a locally linear parameter varying (LPV)
with reduced order, which was identified by systematic perturba-
tions of the high-order physical model at certain steady-state opera-
tion points that span the expected operating space. In addition to
the LPV-based MPC controller, a standard PID controller was

Pseparately designed for the slower temperature control. Spivey and
Edgar [336] proposed two MPC control loops for a TSOFC system
with ejector and pre-reformer: one is MIMO for control of power,
minimum cell temperature, maximum radial temperature gradient,
SCR, and FU, and the other is SISO for air utilization control. Kalman
filters were used for state estimation. The closed-loop simulation
with the constrained MPC algorithm demonstrated effective and
safe load-following and disturbance rejection.

PUnlike model-based approaches, Wang et al. [334] proposed a
data-driven predictive controller. Certain subspace matrices were
calculated from open-loop input-output data, and then the subspace
matrices were used directly for control law, without explicit calcu-
lating the system matrices. The robustness of the proposed predic-
tive controller was verified by simulations when only partial on-line
outputs measurements are available. Zhang and Feng [337] also pro-
posed a data-driven modeling framework for an integrated SOFC/
capacitor system. An offset-free input-to-state stable fuzzy predic-
tive controller was developed and combined with a T-S fuzzy identi-
fication model. The simulation results validated the satisfactory
load-tracking performance of the proposed SOFC control strategy
even in the existence of input constraints.

PThe robust controllers have also been used for the SOFC system.
Sedghisigarchi and Feliachi [338] designed a H1 controller to regu-
late the stack voltage due to small load variations and meanwhile to
keep the fuel cell utilization in a limited safe region. To use the linear
control theory, the SOFC nonlinear dynamic model was linearized.
Corresponding to 70 A increase and 50 A decrease of stack current,
the controller showed good robustness. Fardadi et al. [339] proposed
a H1 controller based on a transient mechanistic model of a single
co-flow SOFC repeat cell. The full nonlinear quasi-2D model for spa-
tial temperature response, with 60 states, was linearized and
reduced to a single 11 state feedback linear system around a baseline
operating condition. Simulation results showed that the robust con-
troller has the ability to realize small and smooth monotonic tem-
perature response to rapid and large load perturbations, as that
temperature variations of less than 5 K were obtained for load per-
turbations of § 25% from nominal. Tsai et al. [340] proposed a multi-
variable robust control of the NETL hybrid performance (HyPer)
simulator facility. System identification was first implemented to
provide empirical transfer functions for the linear window of fuel
cell operation. Via frequency analysis and singular value decomposi-
tion of the transfer-function matrix, a reduced-order linear model
was obtained for better controllability. Then the H1 synthesis
against disturbance was designed to control the cathode airflow and
temperature and speed of the turbomachinery. This work proposed
a multivariate state-space method to manage fuel cell airflow solely
with the use of bypass valves.

4.7. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation

PMaking use of real and virtual components of the fuel cell system,
the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation plays an important role
in narrowing the gap between numerical simulation and system
integration, especially for the development of SOFC/MGT technol-
ogy. The power splitting ratio between SOFC and GT is 3:1(cid:1)5:1 in a
typical SOFC/GT hybrid system. This means that it is not easy to con-
figure a 100 kWe SOFC stack with a commercial 30 kWe or larger
MGT, or reversely, to configure a kWe MGT with a lab-class SOFC
stack. With this regard, HIL technology is very helpful to simulate
SOFC/MGT system, with SOFC simulator and/or MGT simulator
[343].

PUnder the framework of hybrid performance (HyPer) project, the
NETL established a test facility of 250 kW pressurized SOFC/MGT
hybrid system [344]. Controlled by a real-time SOFC model, a pre-
combustor was used as SOFC simulator to mimic the real SOFC stack,
of which the exhaust gas burns with supplementary fuel in a post-

Pburner and then impel a commercial MGT. Because of using the con-
ventional combustor, the experimental cost and risk are significantly
reduced. The test facility can operate under conditions of baseline,
compressor bleed, hot bypass, cold bypass, post fuel cell bleed, etc.
Moreover, the system performance during the transient process and
corresponding control strategies and control algorithms were evalu-
ated [340,345,346,347].

PTo develop a 200 kW high-efficiency SOFC/GT hybrid system, the
Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) also adopted HIL technol-
ogy, using a burner to simulate SOFC stack for system test and pre-
integration [348]. Lai et al. [349] proposed a feasibility study by
using two mimic burners, i.e. the primary burner was used to simu-
late the SOFC, downstream of it, the secondary burner was com-
posed to simulate the combustor. A vehicular turbocharger was used
as MGT simulator and a water injection system was also integrated
to simulate the water mist addition at external reformer in a real
SOFC/GT hybrid system.

5. Conclusions and perspectives

PModeling and simulation have a significant influence on the
development of SOFC technology, in which the macroscopic model-
ing is essential for fundamental and engineering application. The
state of the art of modeling and control of SOFC/GT hybrid system
has been comprehensively reviewed here. Some key topics on mac-
roscopic modeling of electrochemistry and transport in SOFCs were
firstly focused, which include multicomponent mass transfer in
porous electrode, global and elementary kinetics of internal reform-
ing, radiative heat transfer, volume-/area-specific modeling frame-
work, H2/CO competitive electrochemistry, surface diffusion, and
physics-based EIS calculation and methodology of impedance analy-
sis. Then representative macroscopic SOFC models along the classifi-
cation in different dimensions, and commonly used models of
balancing units of the hybrid system were summarized. Among
them, the transient models were paid much attention. With regard
to the hybrid system, the off-design and part-load performance,
load-following characteristics, control strategies and decentralized/
centralized controllers were especially investigated. Some useful
data have been sorted out in tabular form for easy access. Some of
our specific work were also introduced [18], including analytical sol-
utions of decoupled mass/charge transfer (hybrid approach of power
law and perturbation method) [36,248], efficient 1D + 1D thermo-
electrochemical computation [36], nonlinear relationship between
volume-/area-specific exchange current densities [122], diffusion
equivalent circuit model for surface diffusion [101,138], detailed
radiant model based on analytical view factor models [92], nonlinear
and adaptive superposition rate of global H2/CO electrochemical
kinetics [138,153], and in-house multi-level simulation platform for
natural gas IRSOFC/GT system [19,75,276].

PNext, some perspectives on the advanced models and algorithms

and model-based controller design, are discussed below:

P(1) H2/CO global electrochemistry and its relevance to elemen-

tary electrochemistry and mesoscale modeling:

PH2/CO competitive electrochemistry in the anode is the basis of
modeling of hydrocarbon fuel, biomass fuel, and coal fuel operation.
Studies on elementary mechanisms of H2/CO hybrid fuel have
attracted a lot of attention, anyhow, it is still at initial stage. Finding
the kinetic data of elementary steps is first a big challenge. In experi-
ments, impedance analysis on patterned/point anodes was widely
used to realize a clear configuration of TPBs, at the same time these
elegant designs lose information of transport in the real cermet ano-
des [94]. Because of the complexity of details in the elementary
they are generally validated by the overall V-I
mechanisms,

Pperformance and impedance spectra. On the other hand, as a repre-
sentative of mesoscale modeling, Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)
has been increasingly developed in SOFC modeling. However, the
state-of-the-art LBM-SOFC models have many needed to be
improved, e.g. generally modeling single-fuel behaviors, only
accounting for H2 current output (although the complex elementary
mechanism of internal reforming of methane has ever been included
[350]), assuming that the electrochemical reaction only occurs at the
anode/electrolyte interface, etc.

PThe nonlinear/adaptive superposition rate of H2 and CO electro-
chemistry, mentioned in Section 2.2.2.2, gives a new insight of global
kinetics and its relevance to elementary electrochemistry and meso-
scale modeling. Developed via mathematical approaches, the nonlin-
ear global kinetics, when embedded into chemical reactive flow
models, is hopeful to provide more detailed spatial and transient
behaviors, which are not easy to be obtained in experiments, and
can be used to make mutual validation with the elementary mecha-
nisms. On the other hand, as the LBM itself requires compatibility of
macroscopic and mesoscale models based on Chapman-Enskog
expansion, the nonlinear global kinetics could be smoothly intro-
duced (taken as source/sink terms) into the framework of mesoscale
porous-media chemical reactive flow model, and is hopeful to bring
something new to the state-of-the-art LBM-SOFC computation.

P(1) Surface diffusion in macroscopic modeling framework:

Surface diffusion contributes significantly to the overall mass trans-
fer resistance at the high operating current density and high fuel uti-
lization. Surface diffusions are inevitable steps in elementary
mechanisms, however, they have been seldom included in macro-
scopic modeling framework. The diffusion equivalent circuit model
provides a solution with this regard, anyway, it is still a semi-empiri-
cal approach and does not work so well in some cases, e.g. predicting
I-V performance for CO(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2 and H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2 fuel system. Considering
the occupied sites or coverage of species in micro-pores, the Max-
well-Stefan approach provides a further solution to introduce sur-
face diffusion in macroscopic modeling framework [29].

P(1) Thermo-electrochemical-mechanical modeling

Although the review in this paper is focused on electrochemistry and
transport in SOFC, the heat shock, heat stress and heat deformation
are important topics for the ceramic cells. Prediction and estimation
of hot spots is also requested for safe region and controller design.
The fully coupled thermo-electrochemical-mechanical study on
SOFC is currently quite less. Such a fully coupled SOFC model is
costly in computation, with this regards, reasonable simplifications
and the related analytical solutions are valuable for system-level
analysis.

P(1) Analytical solutions and efficient computation algorithms

Explicit analytical solutins are valuable to narrow the gap between
fast and physics-based computation. Moreover, analytical solutions
could provide better physical explanations, and even new mecha-
nisms. As an example, the nonlinear/adaptive superposition rate of
H2/CO global kinetics has come out when we studied the analytical
solutions of electrochemistry and transport. More analytical solu-
tions and efficient computation algorithms should be studied with
more comprehensive and reasonable assumptions of physicochem-
ical phenomena, especially for spatial and transient modeling. On
the other hand, analytical solutions and efficient computation
algorithms are also very beneficial to controller design, e.g. for
feedforward controller and physics-based state estimator, as
explained next. There are quite a few the advanced controllers

P(like MPC, etc.) in practical use, part of the reason is they are not
real-time qualified.

P(1) Physics-based state estimator and nonlinear controller

design

PNot all outputs, especially the inner states, is available for feedback
control for SOFC. State estimation, therefore, plays an important role
in SOFC control, e.g. estimating temperature profile for temperature
gradient control [236,351]. Different kinds of state estimators have
been used, e.g. Kalman filter, NAARX, neural network/Fuzzy identifi-
cation model, all of these work started from the viewpoint of control
theory and signal process. Physics-based state estimation should be
paid much more attention. Mueller et al. [316] used the cell voltage
as a sensor and showed that it is a potential solution for a good dis-
turbance rejection of fuel compositions. With the similar context of
multi-variable, nonlinear and strongly-coupled features, the study
on the PEMFC system is worth learning. Pukrushpan [299] and Bao
et al. [352] also proved that introducing the cell voltage can signifi-
cantly improve the state observability of PEMFC system. Analytical
solutions will play significant roles in physics-based state estimator
design, and also, analytical solutions with time-variant behaviors
can be directly used for dynamic feedforward control, with much
less computation cost than centralized algorithms, like model pre-
dictive control. On the other hand, the strong nonlinearity in fuel
cell system may lead to failure of linearization at the design point,
especially in cases of large disturbance and switch between different
operating modes. Analytical solutions are helpful for identification
of system structure and smooth mode switching.

P(1) Sizing problem of system design and optimization

Most of the modeling study took the prototype of the SWPC demo
hybrid system, due to the open data for validation. Besides the rating
problem, models should be powerful for the sizing problem. The new
applications of SOFC and gas turbine, e.g. various types of fuel (bio-
mass, ammonia, even carbon or direct coal, etc.), combined heat and
power (CHP), combined cool, heat and power (CCHP), integrated gas-
ification combined cycle (IGCC), etc., mean the different, more com-
plex, or even unknown system layouts. High-quality (good accuracy,
detailed spatial profiles, acceptable computational cost for system-
level analysis, maybe also environment-economy relevance) models
of SOFC and the BOP units are essential for system design and opti-
mization to get a comprehensive consideration of energy efficiency,
energy cascade utilization (or exergy efficiency), size and cost, part-
load performance, and energy-environment-economy analysis, etc.
The energy cascade utilization itself is a big issue in thermodynamics
of energy systems.

P(1) Condition management for system control

Most of the control strategies were designed for normal operation at
a continuous mode. As a matter of fact, the operation of a fuel cell
system includes different discrete states, like a start-up, standby,
warm up, shut down, and also switch between different control
modes, etc. A higher hierarchical controller is needed for a smooth
condition management. Based on the mechanism of finite state
machine, the Matlab/Stateflow toolbox is a good option with this
regard. Hajizadeh and Golkar [353] proposed a Stateflow-based
advance supervisory controller in the first layer which captures all of
the possible operation modes of a hybrid fuel cell/battery distributed
generation system. Also in the Stateflow environment, Bao et al.
[354] designed the condition management controller on the first
10 kWe distributed natural gas-fueled PEMFC power plant in China.
As a typical discrete-state running, fault diagnosis is an important
component of condition management, should be studied more.
Hybrid control of discrete and continuous states is a challenge.

P(1) Rapid control prototype for system integration

Controller development needs a lot of iteration of hardware and
software. Rapid control prototype (RCP) and automatic generation of
source code can significantly speed up the controller design and has
been widely used in the development of automobile electronic con-
trol unit. The Real-Time-Workshop(cid:1) toolbox and xPC target toolbox
in Matlab/Simulink environment is good solutions for real-time sim-
ulation and RCP design. Camporeale et al. [261] used the Real-Time-
Workshop(cid:1) toolbox for HIL simulation of the gas turbine. There have
been some practical applications of this technology in PEMFC sys-
tems. Bao et al. implemented xPC-based HIL for real-time pressure
tracking in fuel recirculation subsystem of PEMFC system in the
first-generation Chinese Fuel Cell City Bus [355], and designed the
xPC-based controller in the PEMFC cogeneration system, which was
demonstrated in the Taekwondo Stadium for Beijing 2008 Olympic
Games [354].
