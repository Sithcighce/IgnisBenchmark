Catalyst layers (CLs) are a key component of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, where electrochemical
reactions occur. The future development of catalysts, catalyst supports, ionomer electrolytes, and CL architec-
tures, along with their preparation, is of great importance for achieving high-performance and low-cost PEM fuel
cells. Developing novel CLs involves complex multi-parameter optimization, posing significant challenges for
time-consuming experiments. Due to CL’s nanoscale structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an
appropriate method to investigate transport and structural characteristics in CLs, playing an crucial role in CL
development. This review aims at the fundamentals of MD simulations, overview of MD simulations in CL ap-
plications, latest developments of catalysts, catalyst support, ionomer materials, CL architectures, and roles of
MD in CL development, as well as associated challenges and prospects. This review is invaluable for guiding
researchers in understanding the mechanisms of transport and structural evolution mechanisms in CLs and
developing novel CLs through MD modeling.

1. Introduction

1.1. PEM fuel cells and catalyst layers (CLs)

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell directly converts the
chemical energy stored in hydrogen to electrical energy, which is
regarded as a promising next-generation power device due to its ad-
vantages of high efficiency and low emissions [1,2]. PEM fuel cells have
been used in many fields, such as transportation, submarines, drones,
and stationary power. Fuel cell vehicle (FCV) driven by PEM fuel cells
has successfully achieved commercialization, including Toyota Mirai,
Honda Clarity, and Hyundai Nexo [3–5]. The volumetric power density
(cid:0) 1, whereas there is
of PEM fuel cell stack is improved to over 4.0 kW L
(cid:0) 1
still a large gap between the current level and the goal of 9.0 kW L
[6–9], as shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, the cost of a PEM fuel cell system,
(cid:0) 1 at an annual manufacturing
including stack, decreases to 60 $ kW
volume of 500,000 systems, which is still about 100 % more expensive
than the internal combustion engine (ICE). In future, the fuel cell system

(cid:0) 1) in order
cost needs to be reduced to <30 $ kW
to improve its competitiveness in transportation sector [6–9], as shown
in Fig. 1. Therefore, major challenges still exist in the aspects of PEM fuel
cell performance and cost.

(cid:0) 1 (stack cost <15 $ kW

A PEM fuel cell is composed of several components, including flow
channels, gas diffusion layers (GDLs), catalyst layers (CLs), and mem-
brane (MEM) [10] as shown in Fig. 2a. CLs provide the sites of elec-
trochemical reactions, which highly affect the performance of PEM fuel
cells. CLs consist of precious catalysts and ionomer electrolytes, ac-
counting for ~40 % of the stack cost at a large production volume [8].
Therefore, decreasing the loading of precious catalyst (i.e., Pt) in CLs to
develop low-Pt loading fuel cells with a high-power density attracts
much attention in PEM fuel cell research and development (R&D).
However, major technologies need to be overcome to meet the challenge
of low Pt loading, including the mass transfer resistance and stability of
CLs [9,11]. In a CL, the catalyst/support particles are mixed with the
ionomer electrolytes, finally self-organizing into a porous structure as
shown in Fig. 2b. In a cathode CL, protons are conducted in the hy-
drophilic network of hydrated ionomer electrolytes, while electrons are
conducted in the electrode. Oxygen molecules need to permeate through
CL’s pores and ionomer films on electrodes to reach the reaction sites of
catalysts. A portion of water product can hydrate the ionomer electro-
lytes to form the proton transport network and the other needs to be
removed in order to avoid water accumulation, which may block the gas
transport pathway. Therefore, developing effective transport paths for
reactants and products and increasing the reaction sites are key to
improving the performance of PEM fuel cells. However, a lower Pt
loading can significantly increase the mass transfer resistance in CLs due
to the smaller catalyst surface area for reactions, reducing fuel cell
performance [9,11,12]. Moreover, a CL with low Pt loading faces the
major challenge of severe degradation [9,12]. A small catalyst surface
area due to the low Pt loading will lead to a large percentage decrease in
the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and large increases in the mass
transfer resistance after degradation. Therefore, understanding the un-
derlying mass transfer and structural evolution mechanisms relevant to

reaction sites in CLs is urgent for designing the next-generation CLs of
low Pt loading.

1.2. Research methods for CLs

Experiment measurement and numerical simulation are important to
obtain physical information in CLs. Electron microscopy can be used to
obtain the catalyst/support morphology in a CL, while N2 adsorption
measurement to obtain the pore size distribution [13–16]. Electro-
chemical measurement technologies, such as the rotating disk electrode
(RDE), electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS), and cyclic voltam-
metry (CV), can be employed to measure the catalyst activity, voltage
losses, and ECSA, respectively [9,15,16]. The oxygen transport resis-
tance in CLs can be measured by the limiting current density method,
using the fuel cell test system and a customized single fuel cell [15,16].
The liquid water in PEM fuel cells can be probed using visualization
techniques, such as X-ray and neutron radiography [17–19]. However, it
is difficult to observe the liquid water distribution in CL’s nanoscale
pores due to the limit of resolution. Advanced nano X-ray computed
the CL’s 3D
tomography (nano-CT) can be used to reconstruct
morphology [20,21]. However, the Pt particles, ionomer films, and
smaller primary pores are difficult to be resolved. Moreover, other
state-of-the-art experimental technologies, such as X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spec-
troscopy (EDS), etc., also play an important role in obtaining the CL
structural
features [22,23]. At present, state-of-the-art experiment
technologies cannot obtain all the nanoscale information in CLs,
including transport and structural characteristics. Furthermore, many
experiments are expensive, time-consuming, and non-in-situ, which are

limited for novel CL development.

Simulation methods are widely used in the fields from microscopic to
macroscopic level because they are flexible, high-efficient, and easy to
reveal underlying mechanisms. The commonly used simulation methods
include quantum mechanics (QM) method at electronic scale, molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation and Monte Carlo (MC) at atomic/molecular
scale, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and Lattice Boltzmann (LB) at
mesoscale, and finite volume method (FVM) at macroscale [24–27] as
shown in Fig. 3. The QM methods, such as density functional theory
(DFT) and Hartree-Fock (HF), solve the Schr ̈odinger equation to obtain
the electron-level information. MD and MC consider atoms as mass
points and calculate the potential energy applied to atoms without
taking into account the quantum effects. MD simulation tracks the
atomic trajectories by integrating Newton’s equations of motion to
statistically obtain thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of a
simulation system, while MC method is mainly used to get the ther-
modynamic characteristics of a simulation system. DPD considers
groups of molecules in continuous space as beads, whose interactions
include the conservative repulsive force, dissipative force, and random
force. LB methods involve a set of lattices in discrete space, which have
demonstrated a good application for complex multiphase flow. FVM
follows the continuum assumption of fluid mechanics and is usually
applicable at macroscale. In PEM fuel cells, the main components
contain structures in a wide range of sizes and different simulation
methods have been applied. For example, FVM is used for flow channel
and GDL; LB methods for GDL, MPL, and CL; MD simulation for CL; and
QM methods for catalysts in CL, as shown in Fig. 3. MD simulation has
both high resolution and high computation efficiency, in comparison
with LB and QM methods, and can play a significant role in the devel-
opment of CLs.

MD simulation plays an important role in disclosing detailed infor-
mation that is difficult or impossible to be obtained experimentally,
which can be used in many fields. In previous reviews, the applications
of MD simulations in membrane permeability [28], liquid electrolyte for
rechargeable batteries [29], ionic liquids [30], electrocatalysis [31],
combustion [32], and other fields have been summarized. CL design has
become the priority in PEM fuel cell development to address perfor-
mance and cost challenges. MD modeling can provide insights to un-
derstand the underlying transport and structural evolution mechanisms
in CLs and bridge CL novel design and performance in a real fuel cell
working environment. In this review, we focus on emerging novel CLs
and MD applications for CL development, which are largely unaddressed
by previous reviews. We first discuss the fundamentals of MD modelling,
including the basic theory, different MD methods, potential energy
models for CLs, simulation procedures, and model validation (Section
2). Then we review the current MD works of CLs, including those of
ionomer morphology, proton conduction in ionomers, gas permeation in
ionomers, mechanical deformation of ionomers, O2 adsorption on cat-
alysts,
triple-phase boundary (TPB)
morphology, local O2 transport, ice nucleation, ionomer dispersion in
inks, and ionomer assembly on Pt/C (Section 3). The recent develop-
ment of novel catalysts, catalyst supports, ionomer materials, and CL
architectures as well as the applications of MD in CL development are
discussed (Section 4). Finally, we discuss the challenge and prospect of
MD modeling in CL development (Section 5).

2. Molecular dynamics simulation

MD is an important method to study transport and structural prop-
erties at nanoscale level by analyzing the physical movements of atoms
and molecules [33]. In the 1950s, Alder and Wainwright [34] studied
the movements of rigid spherical molecular systems, which can be
regarded as the earliest MD simulation. Through over 70 years of
development, MD simulation has been widely used in physics, chemis-
try, biology, materials, and other fields. The MD simulation works on
PEM fuel cells can trace back to the early 21st century [35,36]. MD
simulations can be categorized into a few groups, including classical

molecular dynamics (CMD), reactive molecular dynamics (RMD), ab
initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), coarse-grained molecular dynamics
(CGMD), and latest machine-learning molecular dynamics (MLMD)
[31]. The CMD follows the principles of classical mechanics and uses
empirical formulas to describe interactions among atoms, in which the
bond breaking and formation are unavailable [28,29], while the RMD
uses reactive fields to achieve the simulation of bond breaking and
formation [32]. The AIMD uses the QM method to obtain the potential
energy of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, which is high
in accuracy but expensive in computational cost [29]. The CGMD re-
places the groups of atoms by coarse-grained beads to avoid explicitly
representing every atom in a molecular system, which can improve
computational efficiency and extend simulation length and time [28,
29]. Recently, machine learning potentials (MLPs) are trained by ma-
chine learning using the data from QM calculations and then are applied
into MD simulations for MLMD [29,37]. Similarly, MLPs for CG beads
can also be trained [38–40]. MLMD is promising to construct a bridge
between AIMD and CMD, whereas it is under development and has many
challenges that need to be overcome [41]. The comparison among
different MD methods is listed in Table 1.

2.1. Basic theory

From the viewpoint of classical mechanics, molecular system can be
considered as a mechanical system with atoms as units. Atom can be
considered as a mass point due to its nucleus contributing most of the
mass as shown in Fig. 4. The motion of atoms in the molecular system
can be governed by Newton’s second law:

F = ma

(1)

Where F, m, and a are the force, mass, and acceleration of atoms,
respectively. This expression can be described in terms of potential en-
ergy, velocity, and coordinate.

(cid:0) dU
dr

= m

dv
dt

= m

d2r
dt2

(2)

where U, r, and v are the potential energy, coordinate, and velocity of
atoms, respectively, and t is the time. As shown in Fig. 4, if the initial
coordinate and velocity of atom 1 (as an example) and the interaction
between the atom 1 and other atoms are defined, the coordinate and
velocity of atom 1 in the next timestep can be computed via Eq. (2).
Therefore, the position and velocity evolution of any atoms with time
can be tracked. Ensemble is a significant concept in statistical me-
chanics, which represents the combination of numerous thermodynamic
systems with identical macroscopic properties but various microscopic
states. The ensemble can be divided into microcanonical ensemble, ca-
nonical ensemble, isothermal-isobaric ensemble, and grand canonical
ensemble. For microcanonical ensemble, the number of particles (N),
volume (V), and total energy (E) of system are constant, also named NVE
ensemble, which represents an isolated system without exchanging en-
ergy and particles with its environment. For canonical ensemble, the
number of particles (N), volume (V), and temperature (T) of system are
constant, also named NVT ensemble, which is also an isolated system but
exchanging energy with its environment. Different from the above two
ensembles with constant volume, isothermal-isobaric ensemble (also
called NPT ensemble) has constant number of particles (N), temperature
(T), and pressure (P), allowing for volume change. Moreover, grand
canonical ensemble (also called μVT ensemble) has constant chemical
potential (μ), volume (V), and temperature (T), allowing for energy and
particle exchange with its environment. For MD simulations on CLs, NPT
[36,42,43] and NVT [44–46] ensembles are commonly used. The
Nos ́e-Hoover thermostat and barostat are commonly employed to con-
trol the temperature and pressure of simulation systems, respectively
[47–49]. The thermostat method is to couple a dummy heat bath to the
simulation system and alter the atomic velocities to maintain the

average temperature T at the target T0. Similarly, the barostat method is
also to alter the system volume to maintain the average pressure P at the
target P0. The standard Nos ́e-Hoover thermostat suffers from the
drawbacks of the ergodicity violation in the case of simple harmonic
oscillator [50]. Martyna et al. [51] proposed an extension that uses
multiple thermostats connected in a chain, so-called Nos ́e-Hoover-chain
method.

After getting the velocities and coordinates of atoms, the structural,
thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of system can be calculated by
taking the average over a large number of atoms. For example, the
structural property of radial distribution function (RDF), the thermo-
dynamic property of Gibbs free energy, and the kinetic property of self-
diffusivity. Specifically, the RDF is defined as the probability of finding
particle B at the radius r from particle A, of which the expression is

gA(cid:0) B(r) =

(

nB
4πr2dr

) / (

)

NB
V

(3)

where nB is the number of particle B in the dr-thick shell at the radius r
from particle A, 4πr2dr is the volme of the shell, and NB is the total
number of particle B in the simulation system with the volume of V. The
calculation of free energy is more complex. Many methods have been
developed to compute the free energy. For example, thermodynamic
integration (TI) is the method to compute the free energy difference
between two states, by constructing a path between states and inte-
grating the thermodynamics information along the path [52]. However,
challenges for TI method remain on the selection of integration path and
expensive computational cost [53]. Thermodynamic perturbation (TP)
method is another method for computing the free energy difference
between two states [54]. This method is suitable for the problem that
has a minor potential energy difference. Moreover, the non-quilibrium
method based on Jarzynski’s intensity [55] has a high efficiency in
computing the free energy change. Wang et al. [56] carried out the
steered MD based on the non-quilibrium method to compute the free
energy profile of oxygen adsoption on catalysts in PEM fuel cells.
Moreover, enhanced sampling methods, such as Umbrella Sampling
(US) [57], Transition Path Sampling (TPS) [58], Forward Flux Sampling
(FFS) [59], Metadynamics [60], and Seeding MD [61], have been used to
more effectively and precisely compute the free energy profile. Kikkawa
et al. [62] used the US approach to compute the free energy profile of
ionomers through the micrpores of porous carbon in PEM fuel cells.
Besides, the self-diffusivity can be computed by two approaches. One
approach is to compute self-diffusivity from the mean squared
displacement (MSD) of diffusion molecules based on the Einstein rela-
tion [63]. The self-diffusivity (D) is defined as:

D = 1
6N

lim
t→∞

1
t

∑N

i=1

〈|ri(t) (cid:0) ri(0)|2〉

(4)

where r is the coordinate of diffusion particles, and N is the total number
of diffusion particles. Another approach is to compute self-diffusivity by
integrating the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) of diffusion
molecules based on the Green-Kubo formula [64,65]. The self-diffusivity
(D) is expressed as:
∫ ∞

∑N

〈vi(0) ⋅ vi(t)〉dt

(5)

D = 1
3N

i=1

where v is the velocity of diffusion particles, and N is the total number of
diffusion particles.

In theory, the simulation system must contain enough atoms and be
carried out for enough time to ensure the high prediction accuracy of
macroscopic properties. However, the simulation size and time are
limited by the computational cost. Therefore, the periodic boundary
condition (PBC) is commonly employed in MD simulations to mitigate
this obstacle [66]. As long as PBC is implemented, the particle leaving
the simulation box enters the opposite boundary with the same velocity

5

L. Fan et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101220

as shown in Fig. 4. When calculating short-range interactions, the dis-
tance between atoms in a certain direction should be less than or equal
to half the length of simulation box in such direction. Moreover, PBC can
be combined with the Ewald summation method to calculate long-range
electrostatic interactions. After using PBC, the boundary effect of
simulation box can be eliminated to improve computational accuracy.
For example, PBC is used in three directions when simulating the bulk
ionomers [36,42,43,67]. However, PBC is inapplicable in the ionomer
film thickness direction when simulating ionomer films on catalyst
surfaces [44–46,68].

2.2. Molecular dynamics

2.2.1. Classical molecular dynamics

In CMD simulations, the potential energy functions are expressed by
empirical formulas (Eqs. 6–11). The intramolecular interactions include
the bond stretching interaction between two atoms, bond angle bending
interaction among three atoms, dihedral torsion interaction among four
atoms, and other interactions. Moreover, the intermolecular interactions
include the short-range van der Waals interaction and long-range elec-
trostatic one. For complex molecules, especially long-chain molecules,
the non-bond interactions between atoms belonging to one molecule
should be also considered. In CLs, the perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) is a
representative long-chain molecule. The bond stretching and angle
bending are high-frequency motion, which can reach equilibrium
quickly. They are commonly expressed in the form of harmonic oscil-
lators as expressed in Eqs. (7) and (8). However, the dihedral torsion is
low-frequency motion and has a lower potential energy but highly af-
fects the molecular structures. The dihedral torsion interaction is more
complex, of which the potential energy function needs more parameters
as expressed in Eq. (9). Several potential energy functions have been
developed to describe the van der Waals interaction, such as the
Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential, Morse potential, and Buckingham po-
tential. The L-J potential is commonly used, expressed by Eq. (10). Even
in neutral molecules, atoms generally have local charges. Therefore, the
Coulombic interactions are widely existed in molecules, expressed by
Eq. (11).

To perform MD simulations, several simulation platforms have been
developed, such as LAMMPS (large-scale atomic/molecular massively
parallel simulator) [71], GROMACS [72], DL_POLY [73], CHARMM
[74], and NAMD (NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics) [75].

During the last several decades, numerous force fields have been
developed to be applied for many fields. Force field is a group of po-
tential energy functions that describe the intramolecular and intermo-
lecular interactions, including the function forms and corresponding
parameters. A function form is commonly applicable for the identical
type of interaction. Generally, the potential parameter values are
different for different types of atoms. However, the potential parameter
values are regarded to be the same as long as the local molecular

computational

structure is similar, i.e., the potential parameter values are transferable,
to decrease the complexity. The parameters in potential functions can be
obtained through experiments or QM [29]. Therefore, universal force
fields were developed for molecules composed of any atoms in the pe-
riodic table. The common universal force fields include DREIDING [76]
and UFF [77]. These force fields have a strong universality but are
disadvantageous
accuracy. Therefore, more
high-accuracy force fields were developed for specific fields, such as the
COMPASS (condensed-phase optimized molecular potentials for atom-
istic simulation studies) for small organics, polymers, and pharmaceu-
tical molecules [78],
the OPLS (optimized potentials for liquid
simulations) for peptides, small organics, and ionic liquids [79], the
AMBER (assisted model building with energy refinement) for bio-
molecules [80], the GAFF (general AMBER force field) for biomolecules,
small organics, and pharmaceutical molecules [81], and the CHARMM
for biomolecules and small organics [82]. To improve computational
efficiency, the united-atom (UA) force fields were developed, which for
example treats the CH4, CH3, CH2, and CH groups as a united atom. The
common UA force fields include GROMOS (Groningen molecular
simulation) [83], COMPASS (condensed-phase optimized molecular
potentials for atomistic simulation studies) [78], TraPPE (transferable
potentials for phase equilibria) [84,85], and NERD [86]. The commonly
used force fields for CLs are introduced in Section 2.3. CMD is more
popular when studying morphologies of ionomers and TPB, mass
transfer, gas adsorption, and ice nucleation in CLs, of which the appli-
cations of CMD are introduced in Section 3.

2.2.2. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics

CMD is time-consuming due to the massive calculation of the in-
teractions among numerous atoms, limiting the system size and physical
time. It will significantly reduce the calculation quantity when multiple
atoms are mapped to a coarse-grained bead. CG force field in CGMD is
highly dependent on the CG mapping. Martini force field is the popular
CG force field, which has been used in CGMD works of CLs [87–89]. The
Martini force field can describe the bonded and nonbonded interactions
as:

where the terms on the right represent the bond stretching, angle
bending, dihedral torsion, van der Waals interaction, and Columbic
interaction. The parameters are determined according to the topology of
the mass center of CG beads. The Martini force field is continuously
under development. However, the predefined beads in the database of
Martini force field can’t exactly match the CG beads of real materials,
affecting the computational accuracy [90].

Alternatively, the iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) becomes a
commonly used approach for the parametrization of CG force field
corresponding to specific materials. The IBI employs the structural
properties (RDF) of CMD simulations to construct the CG force field of
CG beads. The scheme of IBI is shown in Fig. 5 [90]. Different from
Martini force field only with predefined database, the IBI provides a
scheme to refine the CG force field for specific materials and has been
used in CGMD works of CLs [91,92]. However, the IBI is time-consuming
due to performing extra CMD simulations and multiple iterations for
parametrization. Moreover, reverse mapping can be performed after
CGMD simulations to restore the atomistic structures. Specifically, the
CG beads are reversely replaced by the all-atom groups. Therefore, the
final structure contains all atoms and can provide more detailed infor-
mation. The typical reverse mapping methods are the predetermined
fragment database method and the fragment rotation method [90]. Kuo

et al. [93] combined the two methods to study the PFSA ionomer
morphology, which achieved a high prediction accuracy. CGMD pro-
vides a bridge from microscopic to mesoscopic simulations and achieves
a larger system size and longer physical time. However, the computa-
tional accuracy of transport properties using CGMD is limited due to
ignoring fine molecular structures. CGMD can be employed to investi-
gate the morphologies of ionomers and TPB.

2.2.3. Reactive molecular dynamics

To describe the bond breaking and formation of chemical reactions,
the reactive force fields have been developed for RMD simulations. The
reactive force fields are more complex than classical force fields, which
contain many parameters that are commonly listed in the form of tables
or documents. In CLs, the bond breaking and formation occur in the
processes of HOR and ORR reactions and proton conduction via hipping.
RMD simulations have been applied for CLs. For example, Li et al. [94]
conducted RMD works using the ReaxFF force field to simulate the
formation of Pt nanowires by leaching Ni atoms from PtNi alloy nano-
wires. ReaxFF force field defines each element as one atom type and the
potential energy is represented as a sum of distinct contributions [95]:

Utotal = Ubond + Uangle + Utorsion + UColumbic + Uvdw + Uunder + Uover + Upen

+ Ulp + Ucoa + Uconj

(15)

where the terms on the right represent bond stretching, angle bending,
dihedral torsion, Coulombic interaction, van der Waals interaction,
undercoordinated stability, overcoordinated penalty, angle penalty,
long pairs, three-body conjugation, and four-body conjugation, respec-
tively. Mabuchi et al. [50] performed RMD works using the anharmonic
two-state EVB (aTS-EVB) model [96] to simulate the proton hopping in
PFSA ionomers. The EVB model describes a reactive potential energy
surface in terms of a linear combination of reactant and product wave
functions:

where U is the energy; i and f represent the initial and final states,
respectively; and Uif is the interaction matrix term. Besides, the reactive
force fields contain EAM (embedded-atom method) [97], MEAM
(modified embedded-atom method) [98], SW (Stillinger-Weber) [99],
REBO (reactive empirical bond order) [100], AIREBO (adaptive inter-
molecular REBO) [101], etc. RMD simulations can simulate a larger
system for a longer physical time, which is out of capability of AIMD
simulations when studying chemical reactions. However, complex
parameterization of force fields limits the development of reactive force
fields. Due to the complexity in parameterization, the computational
accuracy of complex or special chemical reactions is limited [32].
Although few RMD works have been carried out for CLs, the applications
of RMD to study reactions and proton hopping are promising.

where α and β represent nuclei; i and j represent electrons; mα and me are
the nuclei mass and electron mass, respectively; ε0 is the permittivity of
vacuum; e is proton charge; ħ is defined as h/2π, where h is the Planck
constant; rαβ is the distance between nuclei α and β with atomic numbers
Zα and Zβ; riα is the distance between electron i and nucleus α; and rij is
the distance between electron i and j. The terms on the right side of Eq.
(18) are the operators for the kinetic energy of nuclei, kinetic energy of
electrons, potential energy of the repulsion between nuclei, potential
energy of the attraction between electrons and nuclei, and potential
energy of the repulsion between electrons, respectively [102]. It is
noteworthy that Eq. (18) is a high-dimensional eigenvalue problem,
which poses significant challenges in terms of solution methodology.
Therefore, approximation must be made to reduce complexity, while
maintaining the prediction accuracy. As the well-known mathematical
approximation, the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) method assumes that the
wave functions of atomic nuclei and electrons can be treated separately
based on the fact that the former are much heavier than the latter [103].
Therefore, nuclei are treated to be approximately fixed, while electrons
are dynamic [104,105]. The motions of nuclei and electrons are

decoupled and the electronic Hamiltonian

To solve the electronic Hamiltonian, different QM methods such as
HF, DFT, Configuration interaction (CI), and Perturbation theory have
been proposed [102,106].

AIMD directly solves the Schr ̈odinger equation to describe atomic
interactions and predicts atomic trajectories using the Newton’s equa-
tion. In theory, AIMD has a higher accuracy than CMD that uses

8

empirical formulas to approximate quantum effects and can effectively
describe bond breaking and formation. Born-Oppenheimer molecular
dynamics (BOMD) is one type of AIMD, which is dependent on the BO
approximation [106]. During BOMD simulations, the potential energy of
a system will be minimized at each timestep. Therefore, BOMD is too
time-consuming and computationally expensive to simulate a large
system. To address this issue, Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics
(CPMD) was developed to improve computational efficiency [107,108],
in which the electronic degrees of freedom is described by an improved
coupled electron-ion dynamics that keeps electrons close to the instan-
taneous BO surface. In this case, an explicit potential energy minimi-
zation at each timestep is not needed, which accelerates AIMD
simulation for a large system with a few thousand atoms for a couple of
nanoseconds [107]. Both BOMD and CPMD regard nuclei as classical
particles and the quantum effects in the motions of nuclei are ignored.
Different from BOMD and CPMD, path integral molecular dynamics
(PIMD) introduces the nuclear quantum effects into MD via Feynman
path integrals [109]. During PIMD simulation, each nucleus that con-
siders quantum effects is mapped to the P beads following Boltzmann
statistics, which are interconnected by springs to form a ring. Each bead
is assigned with a virtual mass and evolves following Newton’s equation
[109]. PIMD is generally employed when studying hydrogen properties
(such as tunneling effect) [110]. AIMD can be employed to study the
reactions on catalysts and the proton hopping, as well as the proton
tunneling in CLs. Due to QM calculations, AIMD simulation is
time-consuming and only feasible when simulating a small system
(<100 atoms). Ingenious design of simulation system is essential to
reveal underlying mechanisms using the limited number of atoms.

2.2.5. Machine-learning molecular dynamics

AIMD utilizes

interatomic interactions

stemming from high-
precision QM calculations, which requires a high computational cost,
while CMD utilizes the interatomic interactions stemming from empir-
ical force fields, which is usually unsatisfactory in computational pre-
cision. MLMD is promising to bridge the gap between the accuracy of
AIMD and the efficiency of CMD [111]. ML is employed to construct
high-precision interatomic interactions based on QM calculations for
MD simulations [112], as shown in Fig. 6. A well-trained MLP can be
embedded into high-precision MD simulations for a larger system [113].
Therefore, MLPs are expected to be accurate, effective, and transferable.
The most important parts of constructing MLPs are to choose ML
methodologies and perform reference data sampling [111], which will
be discussed in the following paragraphs.

Two ML methodologies of kernel-based methods [114,115] and
neural networks [108,116,117] have been widely used to train MLPs, as
shown in Fig. 6. The kernel-based methods utilize linear classifiers to
solve nonlinear problems, among which a popular member is the
support-vector machine (SVM). In this case, the kernel-based descriptor
is employed to describe the potential energy of a system, which is
composed of the pair potential and many-body terms based on kernel
basis functions as follows [118,119]:

functions; Ri is the collection of relative position vectors from the
reference atom i to its neighbor atoms; and the kernel function K(Ri, Rs)

quantifies the similarity of the neighbor atoms, describing the depen-
dence of energy on atomic neighboring environment. The neighboring
density of a specific atom is expressed as a basis of Gaussian functions
within a cut-off radius (Fig. 6b).

Besides, neural networks utilize a neural-network-based descriptor
to describe the potential energy of a system (Fig. 6c). The neural-
network-based descriptor adopts the atom-centered symmetry function
(ACSF) to describe the contribution of neighboring atoms within a cut-
off radius, in which the cartesian coordinates of each atom are con-
verted into a set of symmetry functions to describe atomic local struc-
tural environment [120]. Similar to many classical empirical force
fields, the total potential energy E in the MLP is a sum of energies Ei of
every atom. In addition to the classic ACSF descriptor, deep potential
provides an alternative approach to constructing potential energy sur-
face (PES), which directly uses information such as the atom types, co-
ordinates, and forces to create the descriptor [121]. When choosing ML
methodologies, kernel-based methods are preferred when data points
are less than ~103-104, otherwise neural networks are the better choice
[111]. Generally, kernel-based methods can achieve more accurate
prediction even with fewer training data, while neural networks require
a large amount of training data to obtain an excellent MLP [122].

Accurate and representative data of molecular configurations are
necessary to train a high-quality MLP. However, the dimensionality of
the configurational space of a molecule system is usually too vast to
identify the representative geometries. AIMD is a significant approach
for reference data sampling, which is a straightforward way to appro-
priately obtain the configurational space of a molecule system. To get
abundant data that covers entire PES, a long-time AIMD is required,
which is expensive due to the large amount of QM calculations. To
address this issue, an effective way, called sampling by proxy, can
generate long-time trajectories that cover most regions of PES through
sampling the PES using a low-precision QM method [111]. Then, a
representative set of geometries are collected to perform single-point
calculations using a high-precision computation method such as CCSD
(T). Another way to reduce the computational cost of AIMD is to
accelerate the sampling process using the adaptive sampling (or
on-the-fly ML) [123] and metadynamics sampling [124,125], in which a
small set of reference data are used to train a preliminary MLP and then
the unreliable conformations are collected during MD simulations and
used to retrain MLP. Moreover, the normal mode sampling method starts
from a PES minimum and generates diverse configurations with random
atom displacements along eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix, which
does not need to perform MD simulations like the former samplings
[126]. A well-trained and tested MLP can be employed to simulate a
large system similar to the reference system. Under new conditions, it is
necessary to check its accuracy by using more reference data given that
the MLP may not perform well in extrapolation [111]. Although MLMD

has the potential to bridge the gap between the accuracy of AIMD and
the efficiency of CMD, many challenges still exist in terms of training
data generation, long-range interactions (e.g. electrostatic interaction),
transferability, scalability [41,111]. Currently, the MLMD is under
development and commonly applied in small molecules [41]. To the best
knowledge of authors, there are still no MLMD works of CLs.

2.3. Representative potential energy models for CLs

2.3.1.

Ionomers

PFSA ionomers are commonly used as the materials of membrane
and electrolyte in PEM fuel cells. PFSA is a long-chain molecule
composed of hydrophobic backbones with CF2 groups and hydrophilic
(cid:0)
side chains with SO3
groups. Therefore, one of the major challenges of
MD simulations for CLs is to develop an appropriate potential energy
model for PFSA. In previous MD simulations, many potential energy
models for PFSA have been used, such as DREIDING [36,127–130],
modified DREIDING [42,131–133], GAFF [43,68,134,135], OPLS-AA
[136], CAMPASS [137,138], and UA potential [67,139,140]. Jang
et al. [141] optimized the parameters of DREIDING force field [76] for
perfluorinated n-alkanes, which were further developed for PFSA [36].
The corresponding potential energy parameters are listed in Table 2 and
the partial charges are shown in Fig. 7. Mabuchi et al. [42] further
modified the potential energy parameters of DREIDING force field [76]
to improve the prediction accuracy of PFSA density. The main parameter
modifications are to decrease the torsion force constants to the half of
original values. Moreover, Cui et al. [142] developed a UA potential
energy model for CFx groups, which was further used for PFSA model
[67].

2.3.2. Water and hydroniums

Water is one of the most common materials in MD simulations, of
which over 100 models have been proposed since the first model of
water namely Bernal-Fowler (BF) model [143]. The models can be
divided into rigid water models and flexible water models based on the
bond interactions. The flexible water models permit the bond stretching
and bond angle bending of water molecules, while the rigid ones
consider the bond length and bond angle as constants. Commonly used
water molecule models include TIP3P [144], SPC/E [145], SPC [146],
and F3C [147], etc. TIP3P, SPC/E, and SPC models are rigid models,
while F3C is a flexible one. Moreover, TIP3P, SPC/E, and SPC water
models just consider the van der Waals potential between O atoms,

while F3C model considers the van der Waals potential between O and H
atoms. These water models have been used for hydrated PFSA ionomers
in previous MD works [36,42,43,127–140], of which the potential pa-
rameters and local charges are listed in Table 3. Additionally, Fan et al.
[25] evaluated these water models in predicting temperature-dependent
O2 dissolution and self-diffusion in liquid water for electrochemical
energy devices, such as fuel cells, using MD simulations.

These water models in general perform poorly in simulating icing
phenomenon. The coarse-grained mW models have been widely used to
study this phenomenon, which well reproduces the anomalies and
structures of liquid water, ice, and amorphous solid water, as well as the
transitions between them [148–150]. Zhang et al. [149] used the mW
model to investigate the icing phenomenon on Pt surfaces, while Moore
et al. [150] used the mW model to investigate the freezing and melting
of ice in hydrophilic nanopores. Moreover, TIP4P/ICE model [151] was
developed for simulating water crystallization phenomena, which was
adopted by Haji-Akbari et al. [152] for the ice nucleation rate in
supercooled water-independent nanomembranes. The potential param-
eters and local charges of TIP4P/ICE model are listed in Table 3.
Although few MD simulations on the icing in CLs have been reported, it
is still essential to develop potential energy models below the freezing
point in order to understand the icing phenomenon during the cold start
of PEM fuel cells.

Since the bond breaking and formation are infeasible in CMD, pro-
tons in hydrated PFSA ionomers are considered in the form of hydro-
niums, which have a similar chemical structure as water. Jang et al. [36]
developed a 4-site model for hydronium, in which the charges of O and
H atoms are (cid:0) 0.3819 and 0.4606 e, respectively, with the bond
stretching, bond angle bending, and van der Waals potentials listed in
Table 3. Moreover, Urata et al. [153] assumed the potential parameters
of hydroniums to be identical to those of the TIP3P water model, with
the charges of O and H atoms in hydroniums set as (cid:0) 0.554 and 0.518 e,
respectively. These hydronium models have been widely used in
exploring the hydronium transport
in PFSA ionomers [36,42,43,
127–140].

2.3.3. Carbon and Pt catalysts

The first carbon model is the Tersoff model [100], which was
developed in 1988 and well fitted experimental data in terms of the
lattice constant, binding energies, bulk modulus of diamond, and
binding energy of graphite and DFT data in terms of the energies of
carbon-carbon bond and simple cubic, body-centered cubic and
face-centered cubic phases. Moreover, the REBO model [154] was pro-
posed to improve computational efficiency by only considering 1st- and
2nd-nearest-neighbor interactions. Despite successful applications in
many works, there are still several drawbacks in the REBO model, such
as difficulty in simultaneously fitting equilibrium distances, energies,
and force constants for all types of C-C bonds. Therefore, an extension
model named AIREBO [101] was developed, which modified both the
repulsive and attractive pair interactions in REBO to fit bond properties

and takes into account the long-range interactions and single bond
torsion interactions. Although many high-accuracy carbon models have
been developed, most MD simulations of CLs treated carbon as a rigid
body, neglecting C-C interactions to decrease computational cost. The
interactions between carbon and other atoms are simplified to the L-J
function as listed in Table 4 [140,155–157].

Metals are special from the viewpoint of potential energy functions,
whose interactions are usually described by metal potentials [158].
Currently, most of the widely used metal potentials are based on the
EAM proposed by Daw and Baskes in 1984 [97], which is a many-body
potential based on the contribution of surrounding electron density.
Specifically, the EAM potential energy of an atom is the sum of the

11

pair-wise interaction energy, and the one required to embed this atom
into an electron cloud formed by its neighbors. Later, variants of the
EAM potential were proposed, such as the MEAM [98], which considers
directional coupling. The Sutton-Chen many-body potential [159] is one
type of EAM potential, which provides the potential parameters of Pt
metal. The Sutton-Chen potential is described by Ref. [159]:

Lamas et al. [128] and Cheng et al. [160] employed the Sutton-Chen
potential to simulate the Pt-Pt interactions in their MD simulation of
CLs. However, many MD works of CLs regarded Pt particles as many
rigid bodies, neglecting the Pt-Pt interactions [44,140,155–157]. A L-J
potential is used to represent the interactions between Pt and other
atoms as listed in Table 4. The hypotheses of rigid Pt catalysts and
carbon are reasonable to some degree when the ionomer film on
carbon-supported Pt particles is focused.

2.4. Simulation procedures

CMD is widely applied in CLs. In this subsection, the CMD simulation
procedures used in CLs are introduced. Equilibrium configurations are
essential to statistically analyze the molecular-level properties. To effi-
ciently get equilibrium configurations, MD simulation procedures
should be carefully designed. In previous MD simulations of bulk PFSA
ionomers, the simulation box contains PFSA chains, a given number of
hydroniums to ensure the electric neutrality of system, and a specific
number of water molecules based on the defined water content. PFSA
chains, hydroniums, and water molecules are randomly inserted into a
simulation box to establish the original configuration. Afterwards, the
commonly used annealing procedure by varying the system temperature
between a high and low value several times is carried out to relax the
original configuration and eliminate the initial bias. Moreover, some
researchers [42,161] performed a period of MD simulations before the
annealing procedure, in which the L-J potential parameter (ε) among all
the PFSA atoms were initially reduced by 2 orders of magnitude at high
temperatures and subsequently restored to its original value during the
cooling process. This simulation procedure can avoid the aggregation of
PFSA chains, making them move freely and quickly to eliminate any
initial bias.

Moreover, the simulation procedures of ionomer films covering

are

placed

randomly

and water molecules

carbon-supported catalysts in CLs are more complex. Firstly, Pt catalysts
and carbon support should be reconstructed based on their structural
properties, as shown in Fig. 8a–c [157]. It is worth mentioning that some
of previous MD simulations treated catalysts as multiple Pt layers and
neglected carbon support [44–46,162,163], while some adopted gra-
phene as the carbon support due to the easy reconstruction of ordered
graphene [155,157] as shown in Fig. 8b. Recently, Ran et al. [164]
employed the Hybrid Reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC) method to recon-
struct the commercial amorphous carbon particle as the carbon support,
as shown in Fig. 8c. After reconstructing the carbon-supported catalysts,
the crucial procedure is to obtain the equilibrium ionomer film. Similar
to the simulation procedures of bulk ionomers, the PFSA chains, hy-
on
droniums,
carbon-supported catalysts, followed by similar annealing procedure to
eliminate any initial bias. It is noteworthy that a dummy wall is sug-
gested to be placed on ionomer films to avoid the escape of water
molecules during the annealing procedure. When studying oxygen
transport, the oxygen molecules can be placed onto the obtained equi-
librium ionomer films. Unfortunately, there are only several oxygen
molecules in such a small simulation box under a real working pressure
of CLs, which leads to a large error due to the small number of samples.
To increase statistical samples, the number of oxygen molecules needs to
be increased [44–46]. In principle, oxygen consumption due to the
electrochemical reaction cannot be simulated because the bond
breaking and formation are neglected in CMD simulations. However, the
oxygen molecules that reach the catalyst surface are assumed to be
immediately consumed and removed from the simulation system in
previous CMD simulations, on the basis of the hypothesis that the re-
action is quicker than the mass transfer [44,46,165]. The water distri-
bution in such a small region where oxygen is consumed is assumed to
reach a new equilibrium state before the next oxygen molecule reaches
this region, based on the hypothesis that oxygen transport is slow [44,

46,165]. Therefore, the water content in the ionomer film is considered
to remain constant throughout the simulation. Finally, the high-profile
oxygen transport through the ionomer film can be simulated via CMD
simulations. The main simulation procedures are shown in Fig. 8d.

2.5. Model validation

2.5.1. Sources of errors

Although MD is the microscopic simulation method that finely con-
siders the atoms in molecules and their interactions, the inherent
approximation of this method still exists. The force fields of CMD are
commonly described by empirical formulas, which are obtained by
approximately fitting the QM or experimental data [29]. Therefore,
force fields constitute a primary source of error in MD simulations. The
commonly used force fields and potential models for CLs have been
discussed above. Although AIMD based on QM calculations exhibits a
higher precision, its computational cost is unacceptably expensive and
can be only used for small systems with <100 atoms [32]. Besides, the
simulation settings, including cut-off distance, boundary condition,
integration algorithm, and timestep also lead to different degrees of
simulation error. Moreover, the MD simulation results are statistically
obtained using the positions, velocities, and potentials of atoms in a long
simulation time. Therefore, a larger simulation system with more atoms
will theoretically enhance the simulation precision. For example, Kuo
et al. [131] developed a large simulation system with a length of 40 nm
to comprehensively explore the morphologies of ionomers. Neverthe-
less, computational cost and computational accuracy need to be
balanced in the majority of scenarios.

2.5.2. Model validations

Validation of MD simulations is a major challenge because the
molecular-level properties obtained by MD simulations are difficult or

The ionomer morphologies are the
channel-network structure at low water
contents and tortuous layered structure
at high water contents.
The ionomer morphologies are the
tortuous layered structure with shorter
side chains and swollen network
structure with longer side chains at high
water contents.
The hydronium diffusivities in the
overlapped solvation shells and isolated
solvation shells dominate the total one
at low and high water contents,
respectively.
Proton hopping becomes more
important when the water content is
over 5.6.
At high water contents, protons hop via
the percolated water network to visit
multiple sulfonic acid groups, thereby
decreasing the barrier of proton
transfer.
The O2 diffusivity increases, O2
solubility decreases, and O2 adsorption
site transforms from small cavities to
large surfaces as the water content
increases.
Small cavities exist and block O2
diffusion in ionomers with longer
ionomer side chains at high water
contents.
When the ionomers are stretched, the
backbone ordering increases, while the
side chain ordering increases at low
water contents and decreases at high
water contents. Young’s modulus and
yield stress of ionomers decrease as
water content increases.
The O2 adsorption and residence time
on catalysts scale with the ORR rate.
The O2 adsorption on the catalyst
surface generally increases with
increasing pressure and decreases with
rising temperature.
The morphology is the sandwich and
inverted micelles on hydrophobic
surfaces and bilayer and multilamellar
on hydrophilic ones at high and low
hydrations, respectively.
The hydrophilic Pt surface is mainly
covered by water clusters, while the
hydrophobic carbon surface by PFSA
backbones.
The water molecules, hydroniums, and
sulfonic acid groups concentrate on the
Pt surface, while the ionomer backbones
concentrate on carbon surface.
Pt particles on carbon support are
mainly covered by water molecules. The
adhesion of Pt particles on carbon
support is strengthened when they are
covered by ionomer films.
Larger Pt particles can attract more
PFSA side chains that are be either
perpendicular or inclined with respect
to the Pt surface.
High I/C ratios lead to the self-
aggregated ionomers and the
encapsulation of Pt particles, disrupting
both the proton and gas/liquid channels
at 0.2 mgPt cm
The local O2 transport resistance of the
ionomer-Pt interface accounts for over
80 % of the total transport resistance,

while the one of the ionomer-gas
interface is lowest.
The local O2 transport resistance to the
edges and corners of Pt particles is much
lower than that to Pt facets.
Stronger local electric field and adding
ionic liquids suppress the dense
ionomer-Pt interface, thereby
decreasing local O2 transport resistance.
Increasing the hydrophilic nanoparticle
loading on the substrate inhibits
nucleation.
Ice nucleation of supercooled water is
highly sensitive to Pt surface roughness.
Larger atomic spacing of Pt surface than
the ice crystal distance inhibits icing.
Ionomer aggregate morphologies are
cylindrical-shape particles and random
coil conformations at low and high
ethanol contents, respectively.
Ionomer dispersion increases
significantly as the water/isopropanol
solvent increases, and more ionomer
backbones are directly exposed to the
solvent.
The deposited ionomers gradually
concentrate onto Pt particles due to the
strong attraction of Pt to ionomer
sulfonic acid groups during the solvent
evaporation.
The hydrophilic groups form a water-
filled channel network that gradually
evolves the primary pore structure in
aggregates.

even impossible to access through experiments [166]. The macroscopic
properties statistically acquired by MD simulations, such as density,
diffusivity, and RDF, can be compared with experiment data. For PFSA
ionomers, model validation is mainly made in terms of the PFSA density
and self-diffusivity of water and oxygen molecules in bulk PFSA ion-
omers at different water contents [42–44,46,127,128,131,133,161,
167–175], as shown in Fig. 9. The potential energy model of PFSA
developed by Mabuchi et al. [42] achieved a high prediction accuracy of
PFSA density, with an error of less than 0.16 % at the water content
higher than 4 as shown in Fig. 9a. Although the errors of predicted
self-diffusivities, solubilities, permeabilities, are a little large due to the
smaller simulation systems in most cases, their change trends at different
water contents are accurate as shown in Fig. 9b and d-f. Moreover, Jang
et al. [36] and Cui et al. [67] computed the structure factor through RDF
and compared it with small-angle X-ray scattering and neutron

scattering data.

Moreover, model validation becomes more difficult when exploring
the Pt/C-ionomer interfaces in CLs. First, to achieve real catalyst
reconstruction, the size, morphology, and atom arrangement informa-
tion of catalysts can be measured by TEM, STEM, XRD, etc. For example,
Li et al. [94] reconstructed nanowire catalyst based on fcc Pt crystal
structure and the exposure of some (100) facets along the nanowire axis
observed by experiments. Furthermore, the local oxygen transport re-
sistances through ionomer films to catalysts can be measured by the
limiting current method. The limiting current density is the maximum
current density when the oxygen concentration on catalysts approaches
zero. The oxygen transport resistances are obtained based on the oxygen
concentration difference and transport flux converted from the current
density. Similarly, they can also be computed through MD simulations.
Fan et al. [44] carried out MD simulations on oxygen transport through
ionomer films, in which the oxygen molecules reaching the catalyst
surface are removed to ensure the zero concentration of oxygen on the
surface. Additionally, the oxygen transport flux was computed by
counting the number of oxygen molecules that reach the catalyst surface
within a certain simulation time. As shown in Fig. 9c, the oxygen
transport resistances are compared between MD simulations and ex-
periments [44–46,175].

Besides, some microscopic information has been measured by ex-
periments. For example, Wood III et al. [176] and Masuda et al. [177]
used neutron scattering (NR) and surface X-ray scattering (SXS) tech-
nologies to show that the hydrophobic fluorocarbon groups were the
main species adsorbed on the Pt (111) surface. DeCaluwe et al. [178]
observed the interfacial lamellar structure of ionomer films adjacent to
the Pt surface using NR measurements. These observations provide
strong support for the MD results about ionomer film morphologies [44,
46,165]. Lopez-Haro et al. [179] obtained the ionomer coverage on
catalysts using HAADF-STEM electron tomography and 3D reconstruc-
tion, which proved the change trend of ionomer coverage with different
I/C ratios obtained by MD simulations [180]. Ren et al. [181] used the
dynamic light scattering to observe the ionomer aggregation behavior at
different IPA contents, which was consistent with the MD results by
them. However, comparisons of microscopic structure and transport
properties between experimental results and MD simulations are limited
due to the challenges in experimental observation, warranting further
investigation.

3. Overview of MD simulations for CLs

CLs have complex physicochemical processes and nanometer-sized
structures. Therefore, many MD simulations including CMD, CGMD,
RMD, and AIMD have been carried out to reveal the bulk ionomer
morphology, proton conduction in bulk ionomers, gas permeation in

sembly on Pt/C, as shown in Fig. 10. The representative MD works with
subjects, brief descriptions, and methods are listed in Table 5. Specif-
ically, MD, as a powerful tool, has been employed to reveal the mor-
phologies of bulk ionomers with different side chain lengths at different
water contents, proton conduction properties via hydroniums and
hopping in bulk ionomers, gas diffusion, solution, and permeation
properties in bulk ionomers, the mechanical deformation properties of
ionomers including Young’s modulus and yield stress, oxygen adsorp-
tion properties on catalysts with the co-adsorption of oxygen and other
species, the ionomer film morphologies on catalysts; the morphologies
of TPB, the local oxygen transport through ionomer films to catalysts,
the ice nucleation properties on catalysts, the ionomer dispersion
properties in inks, and the ionomer assembly on Pt/C, especially during
solvent evaporation, which will be further elaborated in the subsequent
discussions.

3.1. Ionomer electrolytes

3.1.1. Morphologies of bulk ionomers

PFSA ionomer is commonly used as an electrolyte in CLs. PFSA
and

a hydrophobic fluorocarbon backbone

contains

ionomer

hydrophilic side chains, and it absorbs water molecules to form the
proton transport network. Many MD simulations have been carried out
to explore the structural properties of bulk PFSA ionomers. Meanwhile,
several morphological models of PFSA ionomers have been proposed,
including the cluster-network model [193], lamellar model [194], par-
allel cylinder model [195], local order model [196], rod network model
[197], and random model [36,198], as shown in Fig. 11a. In early MD
simulations, the length of simulation box was usually less than 10 nm,
which is too small to probe the bulk ionomer morphology. Knox et al.
[130] developed a large-size simulation box with a length of ~30 nm to
compare the main morphological models of PFSA ionomers and found
that all the models showed fast formation of connecting bridges among
water clusters and hence network percolation, in which the sulfonic acid
groups played a significant role. However, the structure factor or RDF
could not be used to distinguish the different morphological models of
PFSA ionomers. Recently, Kuo et al. [131] used a larger-size simulation
box (~40 nm in length) to further probe the morphologies of bulk PFSA
ionomers at different water contents. They found that the ionomer
morphology highly depended on the water content, showing a
channel-network structure at low water contents and a tortuous layered
structure at high water contents, as shown in Fig. 11b. Moreover, they
[182] also explored the effects of PFSA side chain length on the ionomer
morphologies and indicated that the ionomer morphology with longer
PFSA side chains (LSCs) converted into the swollen network structure at

high water contents and remained the channel-network structure at low
water contents, as shown in Fig. 11b.

3.1.2. Proton conduction in bulk ionomers

Proton conduction is the main function of PFSA ionomers in CLs. The
significant proton conduction phenomenon was also investigated using
MD simulations. In CMD simulations, the protons are mostly considered

in the form of hydroniums [42,67,82]. Cui et al. [67] found that the
hydronium ions were hydrated by less than two water molecules at low
water contents, thereby limiting the structural diffusion of hydronium
ions, while they were fully hydrated to be capable of forming Eigen ions
at high water contents and thus the structural diffusion of hydronium
ions was significantly enhanced. Karo et al. [82] observed that the water
channels in PFSA ionomers played a significant role in proton

conduction and the velocity of protons in the middle of water channels
was higher than that close to the interface of PFSA backbones and water
channels, where the PFSA side chains had a strong attraction to protons.
Moreover, Mabuchi et al. [42] detailly analyzed the structural properties
of the sulfonic acid groups in PFSA in terms of isolated and overlapped
solvation shells, as shown in Fig. 12a. The hydronium diffusivity in the
overlapped solvation shells dominated the total diffusivity at low water
contents (≤6), while that in the isolated solvation shells dominated at
high water contents (>6).

Besides, the Grotthuss mechanism via the proton hopping has been
considered as another key mechanism of proton transport [50,186,187,
199]. The details of Grotthuss mechanism remain unclear. The CMD fails
to simulate the proton hopping phenomenon considering that it is un-
able to simulate bond breaking and formation. Therefore, the RMD and
AIMD simulations were carried out to explore the proton hopping.
Mabuchi et al. [50,199] found that the Grotthuss mechanism became
more important under the water contents of over 5.6 using RMD simu-
lations as shown in Fig. 12b. Moreover, the Grotthuss mechanism
dominated the proton transport in the free water region close to the
middle of water channels. Considering both the vehicular and Grotthuss
mechanisms, the difference between experimental and simulated diffu-
sion coefficients of protons became smaller comparing with only
considering the vehicular mechanism as shown in Fig. 12c. Devanathan
et al. [187] carried out AIMD simulations, indicating that proton

transport was dominated by proton hopping regardless of water content.
At high water contents, protons could hop via the percolated water
network to visit multiple sulfonic acid groups, thereby decreasing the
energy barrier for proton transfer from SO3-H3O contact ion pair to a
solvent-separated ion pair. Zelovich et al. [186] explored proton trans-
port in PFSA ionomers at low water contents using AIMD simulations.
Few water molecules were present close to the sulfonic acid groups and
the water molecules were non-uniform at low water contents, and as a
result, it is difficult for proton transport via the vehicular mechanism. In
(cid:0) +
this case,
+↔SO3H + H2O could be an essential part of proton conduction.

the proton hopping according to the reaction SO3

Quantum mechanical tunneling has attracted much attention [110,
200–202]. It can be viewed as a process where a particle can penetrate a
finite potential energy barrier, although there is not sufficient energy to
overcome it [201]. The tunneling commonly occurs for light atoms,
particularly hydrogen, which will affect the rates and selectivities of
chemical reactions. Cassone et al. [110] used path integral AIMD sim-
ulations to explore the nuclear quantum effects (e.g. tunneling) on the
proton transfer in liquid water. They found that the proton conductivity
was ~50 % larger when the nuclear quantum effects were taken into
account. However, the study on the proton tunneling phenomenon in
ionomers is lacking. So far, no appropriate simulation method can get

insights into all complex proton transfer processes in ionomer electro-
lytes. Therefore, multiple simulation methods are needed considering
that complex processes, such as proton hopping, proton tunneling, and
hydronium diffusion happen on different lengths and time scales.

3.1.3. Gas permeation in bulk ionomers

Besides, CMD simulations were also carried out to study gas molecule
permeation in PFSA ionomers. Ben et al. [161,188] and Fan et al. [133]
found that the solubility of oxygen molecules in PFSA ionomers
decreased while the diffusivity increased, as the water content increased
(Fig. 13a and b). And with increasing water content, the oxygen
permeability with respect to the oxygen solubility and diffusivity in
PFSA ionomers increased. Oxygen molecules were mainly located in the
coral-like framework of PFSA ionomers and adsorbed close to the in-
terfaces that were formed by hydrophobic backbones or hydrophilic side
chains. At low water contents, the small cavities in the framework of
PFSA ionomers confined gas molecules, thereby resulting in low diffu-
sivity but high solubility as shown in Fig. 13c. As the water content
increased, the small cavities gradually vanished and the adsorption sites
of gas molecules transferred from small cavities to larger surfaces,
thereby enhancing the diffusion of gas molecules as shown in Fig. 13d.
Fan’s work [133] revealed that the small cavities still existed in the PFSA
ionomers with longer side chains even at high water contents, as shown
in Fig. 13d. Therefore, oxygen diffusivity in the ionomers with longer

PFSA side chains was lower than that in the PFSA ionomers with shorter
side chains, while oxygen solubility in the PFSA ionomers with longer
side chains was higher. Water transport phenomena through PFSA
ionomers were explored via Daly’s works [139,203]. At low water
contents, the water molecules at the interface of the rod-like water
clusters in PFSA ionomers diffused via a mechanism, in which trans-
lations were much faster than rotations, different from the diffusion
mechanism in liquid water. However, at high water contents, the water
diffusion mechanism in PFSA ionomers became the same as that in
liquid water, because of more water molecules in ionomers. When water
molecules penetrated PFSA ionomers, the hydrophobic PFSA backbones
at the interface were the dominant cause for high water permeation
resistance. The water permeation resistance greatly decreased when the
PFSA ionomer was placed in contact with liquid water.

3.1.4. Mechanical deformation of bulk ionomers

The structural and mechanical characteristics of bulk PFSA ionomers
were also investigated via CMD simulations [132,134,182,204]. Kuo
et al. [132] explored the mechanical properties of bulk PFSA ionomers
by stretching ionomers along a direction as shown in Fig. 14a and found
that the PFSA ionomers had a higher Young’s modulus and yield stress at
low water contents. When the PFSA ionomers were stretched along a
particular direction, the PFSA backbones were extended along the
stretching direction to increase the backbone ordering which enhanced

proton conduction as shown in Fig. 14b. However, the PFSA side chains
were extended laterally in the stretching direction to decrease side chain
ordering and strongly combine with free protons at high water contents
as shown in Fig. 14c, thereby limiting the proton mobility. It is note-
worthy that the proton tunning was not considered in this MD work. The
phenomena were also observed by Allahyarov’s work [204]. They also
found that the ionomers with longer side chains showed lower and
higher mechanical strengths than the ones with shorter side chains at
lower and higher water contents, respectively [182]. Xie et al. [134]
found that PFSA ionomers had a slit-like crack perpendicular to the di-
rection of imposed strain,
leaving thin fibrils composed of a few
extended PFSA chains.

3.2. Catalysts and triple-phase boundary

3.2.1. Oxygen adsorption on catalysts

Initial oxygen adsorption to the catalyst surface is the first step for
ORR, which directly determines the performance of CLs. Oxygen
adsorption is dependent on many factors, such as catalyst surface

structure, electrolyte types, temperature, etc [56,189,205]. Wang et al.
[56] used CMD simulations to explore the oxygen adsorption on the
catalyst-electrolyte interface and explained the correlation between
oxygen adsorption and ORR activity for the first time. They found that
the adsorption free energies of oxygen molecules in direct with Pt(110),
(cid:0) 1,
(111), and (100) surfaces were (cid:0) 1.54, (cid:0) 1.03, and 0.83 kcal mol
respectively, as shown in Fig. 15a–c. The oxygen affinity to Pt surfaces
increased in the order of Pt(100) < Pt(111) < Pt(110), which followed
the trend of ORR activity observed in experiments. The location and
height of water density peaks shown in Fig. 15d correlated with the O2
adsorption barriers and regulated O2 permeation. Moreover, as shown in
Fig. 15e–g, the rough Pt(110) surface promoted corrugation of the water
adlayer (Fig. 2e) and formed many hydrogen bonds between the first
water adlayer and bulk water molecules, which favored the oxygen
adsorption, compared with Pt(111) and (100) surfaces. Furthermore, the
oxygen adsorption on the irregular surface structures of catalysts,
including nanowire, jagged nanowire, and nanoplate, was also investi-
gated. Some sites on the corrugated surfaces of nanowire and nanoplate
had considerably higher oxygen retention and adsorption than the flat Pt

(110), Pt(111), and Pt(100) surfaces. And the sites with strongest oxygen
adsorption often had higher Pt-Pt coordination numbers. Therefore,
locally
special catalyst structures with corrugated, slightly curved,
concave surfaces, etc., certainly increase the contact time of oxygen
molecules to catalyst surfaces, and as a result, the ORR rate can be
improved. Furthermore, the competitive adsorption of electrolytes
(cid:0)
highly affects oxygen adsorption. They found that the HSO4
and H3PO4
showed a stronger affinity to the catalyst surface than oxygen molecules,
especially for Pt(111) surface. Moreover, Li et al. [205] also found that
water adsorption decreased the stability of oxygen adsorption using
CMD simulations. Moreover, Lin et al. [189] found that the oxygen
adsorption on the catalyst surface generally increased with increasing
pressure and decreased with rising temperature using RMD simulations.
Therefore,
the initial adsorption on the catalyst surface is both
structure-sensitive and environment-sensitive. To evaluate the whole
ORR reaction process, only MD simulations are not enough. Many
studies employed DFT method to obtain insights into possible reaction
intermediates and energy barriers [206–209]. Combining multiscale
simulation methods is essential to reveal underlying reaction mecha-
nisms and guide the designs of catalysts.

3.2.2. Morphologies of ionomer films on catalysts

The thickness of ionomer films that cover catalysts in CLs is several
nanometers, where the structural properties are different from those in

bulk PFSA ionomers. MD simulations can be applied to reveal the ion-
omer film morphology. Borges et al. [68,183] explored the ionomer film
morphologies at unstructured surfaces with different hydrophilic prop-
erties, in which the hydrophilic surface was more like the Pt surface and
the hydrophobic one was more like the carbon surface. They found that
the film morphology on a hydrophobic surface was like a sandwich
structure at high water contents and an inverted micelle structure at low
water contents. On an intermediate surface, it was converted into a large
cluster structure at high water contents and a small cluster structure at
low water contents, while on a hydrophilic surface it was converted into
a bilayer structure at high water contents and a multilamellar structure
at low water contents, as shown in Fig. 16a and b. Furthermore, water
diffusion properties were different at different surface wetting proper-
ties. Water diffusivity was improved above the average value in the
region close to the surface and highly suppressed in the region close to
the ionomer-air interface when the surface became more hydrophilic. In
addition, the morphology of capped ionomer films between two un-
structured surfaces was investigated in Sengupta’s work [210]. For the
more hydrophilic surface, water clusters in the ionomer film became
smaller and more isolated, but water channels became less tortuous,
leading to higher in-plane water diffusivity. Mashio et al. [135] explored
the ionomer film morphology on a graphite sheet and found that the
hydrophobic PFSA backbones were attached to the graphite sheet, while
the hydrophilic side chains were oriented away from the graphite sheet.

L. Fan et al.

Water molecules in the ionomer film formed small and isolated clusters
at low water contents, and large and interconnected water clusters at
high water contents. They also investigated [91] the effects of electrode
surface wetting on the structural properties using CGMD simulations.
The hydrophilic Pt electrode surface was covered by water clusters,
while the hydrophobic carbon electrode surface was by PFSA backbones.
Increasing Pt content could convert the surface of Pt/C electrodes to be
more hydrophilic, thereby changing the ionomer film morphology.
Similarly, You et al. [211] observed that the concentration of hydro-
philic components on the electrode surface increased with a higher
loading of single-atom Pt catalysts. Meanwhile, the MD simulations by
Kang et al. [162] also demonstrated that the hydrophilic components of
water molecules, hydroniums, and sulfonic acid groups tended to
concentrate on the Pt surface as the water content increased, while the
hydrophobic backbones tended to concentrate on the carbon surface, as
shown in Fig. 16c. Therefore, the ionomer film morphology is signifi-
cantly dependent on the surface wetting properties, which vary between
Pt catalysts and carbon support is different. The structure of ionomer
films in the thickness direction is heterogeneous, different from that of
bulk PFSA ionomers.

3.2.3. Morphologies of TPB

The TPB in CLs are the sites where multiple physicochemical pro-
cesses occur. The TPB morphology is complex and directly affects the
performance of PEM fuel cells. The ionomer-Pt/carbon interface in CLs
was investigated using CMD simulations in He’s works [140,157,190].
As shown in Fig. 17a and b, a thicker ionomer film could achieve a better
coverage of carbon surface, higher water retention, and less balling up.
Carbon surface oxidation through epoxidation could easily lead to the
partial delamination of the ionomer film as shown in Fig. 17c, while the
one through hydroxylation could strengthen the film adhesion. More-
over, the Pt particle had a strong attraction to water molecules and thus
many water molecules concentrated on the Pt particle as shown in
Fig. 17d, compared with the case without the Pt particle. In addition,
they also explored the adhesion of Pt particles on the carbon support
[157,190]. The adhesion of Pt particles could be strengthened when
adding the ionomer film and increasing the Pt particle size. The tetra-
hedral Pt particle showed a stronger adhesion than the cubic, octahe-
dral, and truncated octahedral particles due to its unique anchor-like
structure. The hydroxylation of carbon support enhanced the Pt particle
adhesion, while the epoxidation of carbon support weakened it. Lamas
et al. [128] found that a portion of Pt particles were covered by the

hydrophilic region of ionomer films, while the rest were exposed to the
gas region using CMD simulations. Cheng et al. [160] found that the Pt
particle size highly impacted the structural properties of the interfaces
among ionomers, Pt, and carbon using CMD simulations. Most of the
PFSA side chains were oriented away from smaller Pt particles with
smaller surface area as shown in Fig. 17e, while they were concentrated
near larger Pt particles and either perpendicular or inclined with respect
to the Pt surface as shown in Fig. 17f and g. Two possible proton con-
duction mechanisms were proposed based on their simulation results,
one was the dissolution into water and the other was the Pt surface
diffusion. Wang et al. [138] found that increasing the water content in
ionomer films could strengthen the adhesion of Pt particles on the car-
bon surface using CMD simulations. Jim ́enez-García et al. [212]
computed the active area of TPB using CMD simulations. In their sim-
ulations, the active area was defined as the Pt atoms in contact with
sulfonic acid groups, water molecules, and hydroniums, which was also
compared with the experimental results measured by cyclic voltamme-
try (CV) tests. They found that the high ionomer content decreased the
active area (i.e., catalyst utilization) due to the strong interaction be-
tween sulfonic acid groups and Pt atoms increasing the coverage of
hydrophobic backbones onto the Pt surface. All-atom MD simulations
only contain a few catalyst particles due to the limitation of computa-
tional capacity. Jiang et al. [89] used CGMD to explore the TPB
morphology, in which dozens of catalyst particles were considered as
shown in Fig. 17h. They observed the proton transport channels and
gas/liquid transport channels and found that the I/C ratio should care-
fully match with Pt loading. For example, under a Pt loading of 0.2 mg
(cid:0) 2, the high I/C ratio could lead to the self-aggregated ionomers and
cm
the encapsulation of Pt particles, thereby disrupting both the proton and
gas/liquid channels. Therefore, this CGMD approach could be used to
optimize the key parameters, such as I/C ratio and Pt loading, that affect
TPB. Therefore, the structural properties of TPB are influenced by the
morphology and size of Pt particles, the surface properties of carbon
support, as well as the thickness, content, and hydration level of ionomer
films.

3.2.4. Local oxygen transport

Local oxygen transport resistance through ionomer films towards the
Pt surface leads to severe voltage loss, significantly limiting PEM fuel
cell performance. The oxygen transport behavior near Pt catalysts is
difficult or impossible to be experimentally observed. Therefore, MD
simulations have played an important role in revealing oxygen transport
properties. Kurihara et al. [46,165] developed the MD model of oxygen
transport through ionomer films to the Pt substrate. They found that
ionomer films could be divided into three different regions: the
ionomer-gas interface, bulk ionomer, and ionomer-Pt interface, as
shown in Fig. 18a. The oxygen permeability in the ionomer-Pt interface
played a dominant role in the total oxygen permeability, due to its dense
structure. The oxygen transport resistance computed by the phenome-
nological equation showed that the one of the ionomer-Pt interface
accounted for over 80 % of the total one, while the one of the
ionomer-gas interface was lowest, as shown in Fig. 18b. However, Jin-
nouchi et al. [45] indicated that the two free energy barriers at the
ionomer-gas and ionomer-Pt interfaces limited the oxygen permeation
through ionomer films, and the latter played a dominant role. Fan et al.
[44,155,163,191] also found that the ionomer films on a Pt surface
contained three regions and the dense structure with the tight
arrangement of PFSA chains in the ionomer-Pt interface due to Pt atoms’
strong attraction resulted in the high oxygen transport resistance, and
oxygen molecules penetrated the ionomer-Pt interface mainly via water
sites [44]. Therefore, suppressing the dense ionomer-Pt interface and
increasing the number of water sites could reduce the oxygen transport
resistance. They also simulated the oxygen transport phenomenon
through ionomer films on a carbon-supported Pt particle and found that
the ionomer film near Pt edges and corners showed a lower density than
that on Pt facets, thereby leading to a higher oxygen density near Pt

edges and corners [155], as shown in Fig. 18c. Finally, approximately
90 % of oxygen molecules reached the corners and edges of the Pt
particle due to the denser structure on the particle’s facets, as shown in
Fig. 18d. It was suggested that the oxygen permeation route was through
the ionomer films close to the corners and edges of the Pt particle, as
shown in Fig. 18e. The design of Pt particles with additional corners and
edges might be a potential way to reduce oxygen transport resistance.
Moreover, the local electric field strength of Pt electrode can be tuned by
altering the Pt particle’s structure. Stronger local electric field could
suppress the dense ionomer/Pt interface and make the ionomer matrix
and water clusters more uniform, thereby forming more oxygen trans-
port paths and reducing oxygen transport resistance [191]. Further-
more, adding ionic liquids on the Pt electrode not only increased the
mass activity of catalysts but also decreased the local oxygen transport
resistance through ionomer films [163]. The ionic liquids could suppress
the tight arrangement of PFSA chains on the Pt surface and thus enhance
the oxygen permeation through the ionomer-Pt interface. Recent ad-
vancements have led to the development of high oxygen-permeability
ionomers designed to mitigate the dense structural characteristics and
improve oxygen transport, which will be discussed in the next section.

3.3. Ice nucleation during cold start

PEM fuel cells as a power device in the transportation sector inevi-
tably face the challenge of cold start at sub-freezing temperatures. In this
case, the water generated by the electrochemical reaction in CLs may
freeze [213]. The accumulation of ice tends to block the transport paths
of gaseous reactants and damage the CL structure, thereby affecting PEM
fuel cell performance and durability [214,215]. Generally, ice genera-
tion undergoes nucleation and growth. As shown in Fig. 19a, Dursch
et al. [216] found that the isothermal number-average induction times
of ice nucleation in the CLs with (black triangle symbols) and without
(purple cube symbols) Pt particles at different subcooling temperatures
were the same, while those in the CLs with different types of carbon
support (blue triangle symbols, blue diamond symbols, and black cycle
symbols) were different. Therefore, the structure of carbon support
played a dominant role in the ice crystallization process in CLs instead of
Pt catalysts. Although the aforementioned experiments were carried out
to explore water freezing in CLs, the detailed mechanisms of ice nucle-
ation remain experimentally elusive and are not yet fully understood.

MD simulations are a powerful tool to investigate both homogeneous
and heterogeneous ice nucleation. Molinero et al. [148] developed a
coarse-grained model of water (mW), which could reproduce the energy,
density, and structure of liquid water with a high accuracy and was
widely adopted in MD simulations to simulate ice nucleation. Moreover,
the TIP4P/ICE model developed by Abascal et al. [151] could also
accurately simulate ice nucleation. Ice nucleation is a rare event that
needs a long-time simulation, which poses a challenge to the computa-
tional cost of MD simulations. Therefore, different methods have been
embedded into MD simulations to calculate the free energy barriers and
ice nucleation rates, such as Umbrella Sampling (US) [57], Transition
Path Sampling (TPS) [58], Forward Flux Sampling (FFS) [59], Meta-
dynamics [188], and Seeding MD [61]. Using MD simulations, Moore
et al. [150] found that the melting temperature of ice in confined pores
was lower than the normal melting temperature and could depend on
the pore size. Therefore, the water in porous carbon’s pores may be
difficult to freeze during cold start. Zhang et al. [149] investigated the
effects of Pt surface roughness on ice nucleation and found that the
nucleation behavior of the supercooled water was highly sensitive to the
groove size as shown in Fig. 19b. When the groove size well-matched the
ice crystal size, the ice nucleation could be significantly promoted.
Metya et al. [184] investigated the ice nucleation on a graphite substrate
with nanoparticles and found that increasing the loading of hydrophilic
nanoparticles could inhibit nucleation. The more hydrophobic nano-
particles stayed at the vapor-liquid interface, while more hydrophilic
ones stayed inside the liquid droplet as shown in Fig. 19c. Wang et al.

[192] explored the effects of different Pt crystalline surfaces on the ice
nucleation as shown in Fig. 19d. Based on their MD results, the Pt(211)
surface could inhibit icing considering that the atomic spacing of (211)
surface was much larger than the distance of ice crystal as shown in
Fig. 19e. Specifically, the buckling of water overlayer that acted as a
template for ice layers. Yan et al. [217] found that the electric field could
heterogeneously nucleate ice even at the temperature higher than the
freezing point. Haji-Akbari et al. [218] used TIP4P/ICE model and FFS
to directly simulate the homogeneous nucleation of ice at 230 K and
found that the icing transition state contained abundant cubic ice crys-
tals rather than thermodynamically stable hexagonal ones. Although
some MD simulations of ice nucleation have been conducted, studies
specifically addressing ice nucleation in CLs with catalysts, catalyst
support, and ionomers as well as their effects on mass transfer and re-
actions remain scarce.

3.4. Structural evolution during preparation processes of CLs

3.4.1.

Ionomer dispersion in inks

The CL preparation processes, including the mixing process of ion-
omers, catalysts and solvent, and the evaporation process of solvent, are
complex and difficult to accurately control. MD simulations have been
developed to reveal the structural evolution behavior during the prep-
aration processes and guide the optimization of preparation. First, the
ionomer dispersion behavior in inks has been explored. Kuo et al. [185]
explored the aggregation behavior of PFSA ionomers in water-ethanol
mixtures using CGMD simulations and found that the PFSA ionomer
morphologies were different at different ethanol contents due to the
electrostatic interactions among the charged groups. Specifically, the
PFSA ionomer morphologies were cylindrical-shape particles at low
ethanol contents and random coil conformations at high ethanol con-
tents, as shown in Fig. 20a. In addition, they compared the predicted
diameters of cylindrical particles at different ethanol contents with the
SAXS experimental data [219], to verify their CGMD results. Mabuchi
et al. [220,221] explored the PFSA ionomer morphology in 1-propanol/-
water mixtures. Based on their simulation results, the ionomers would

self-organize into a cylindrical aggregate with a diameter of ~2–3 nm in
the solvent. The aggregates would become bigger as the ionomer content
increased and became longer as the solvent mixture content increased.
Therefore, excess 1-propanol did not necessarily benefit the ionomer’s
dispersion, especially at high ionomer contents. Ghelichi et al. [222]
also observed the cylindrical aggregates of PFSA ionomers in the dilute
solvent, with a core of hydrophobic backbones. The aggregate size was
dependent on the backbone hydrophobicity, electrostatic interaction
strength between charged groups, side chain content, and counterion
valence. Moreover, Ren et al. [181] carried out MD simulations to find
that the ionomer aggregation mitigated significantly as the water/-
isopropanol solvent increased, and more ionomer backbones were
directly exposed to the solvent. This behavior has been verified by them
through the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement.

Ionomer self-assembly on Pt/C electrodes

In addition, the ionomer self-assembly behavior on Pt/C electrodes
was also investigated using MD simulations. Mashio et al. [223]
explored the
in a
solvent-saturated environment. Based on their CMD results, the ionomer
coverage rate was highest in a water-rich solvent for low equivalent
weight ionomers, while the ionomer coverage rate of high equivalent
weight ionomers could be improved by adding alcohol into the solvent.
Liu et al. [224] compared the ionomer self-assembly on the Pt surface
when the side chain lengths of ionomers were different. Based on their
CMD results, the ionomers with longer side chains were closer to the Pt
surface and the ionomer chains were more tightly aggregated, which
increased the difficulty of oxygen transport to the Pt surface. Further-
more, they measured the oxygen transport resistances and found that the
one through the ionomers with longer side chains was higher, which
verified the CMD results. Mabuchi et al. [180] observed the evolution of
ionomer morphologies on a substrate during solvent evaporation using
CGMD simulations. As shown in Fig. 20b, the ionomer film coverage on
the surface increased with the increase of the ionomer-to-carbon mass
ratio. Moreover, a discontinuous ionomer film with low coverage was

formed on a hydrophobic substrate, while a high-coverage ionomer film
was formed on a hydrophilic substrate at low ionomer contents. The
predicted ionomer coverage has been compared with the experimental
results using the HAADF-STEM electron tomography and 3D recon-
struction [179]. Moreover,
the ionomer film morphology was a
lamellar-like structure with multiple water layers at high ionomer con-
tents. They also investigated the morphological evolution of ionomer
films on Pt/C during water evaporation [87]. During evaporation, the
deposited ionomers gradually concentrated onto Pt particles due to the
strong attraction of Pt to ionomer sulfonic acid groups. With the increase
of the I/C ratio, the ionomer network gradually formed. In the case of
fast evaporation, ionomers aggregated in advance before depositing
onto Pt/C surface, which highly affected the ionomer dispersion. Xiao
et al. [88] simulated the whole CL preparation processes, including the
dispersion of Pt/C in the solvent, the addition of PTFE, the solvent
removal during heating and the drying process, the addition of PFSA
ionomers, and the evaporation of residual solvent using CGMD simula-
tions, as shown in Fig. 20c. The important finding was that the hydro-
philic groups formed a water-filled channel network, which gradually
evolved the primary pore structure in aggregates. Although MD simu-
lation is an appropriate method to investigate CL preparation processes,
current MD works are still few, especially for the structural evolution
phenomena during solvent evaporation.

4. Recent CL development and MD applications

CL is the key component of PEM fuel cells. Recently, CLs with respect
to catalysts, catalyst support, ionomer materials, and CL architectures
have been carefully developed. Moreover, MD simulation plays an
important role in revealing underlying mechanisms and guiding designs.
In this section, we summarize the recent CL development and the ap-
plications of MD simulations. The representative applications of MD in
CL development are summarized and listed in Table 6. For example, in
the development of nanowire catalysts, MD simulations demonstrated
that the enhanced ORR activity was attributed to the structural

carbon and N-modified carbon, ionomer materials including PFSA with shorter side chains and ring-structured backbone, CL architectures including gradient CL,

characteristics of nanowires and the reduced local oxygen transport
resistance was due to the ionomer film morphology on nanowires. In Fe-
N-C catalysts, MD simulations revealed increased stability in terms of
the vibration and amplitude of the chemical bonds of Fe-N4. In porous
carbon, MD simulations elucidated the effect of ionomer penetration
into micropores and the transport behavior of oxygen and protons
within these micropores. In N-modified carbon, MD simulations inves-
tigated the interactions between ionomers and N-modified carbon sur-
face. In ring-structured ionomers, MD simulations showed increased
oxygen permeability in ionomers with ring-structured backbones.
Further discussions are elaborated in the subsequent sections.

4.1. Catalysts

Catalysts with high activity and stability are key for developing high-
performance PEM fuel cells. The main design strategies of catalysts
include reducing the catalyst size, alloying Pt with transition metals,
developing novel catalyst architectures, and developing Pt-free cata-
lysts, as shown in Fig. 21. Jagged nanowires developed by Li et al. [94]
(cid:0) 1 in the RDE testing.
showed the highest ORR mass activity of 13.6 A mgPt
They suggested that
the highly stressed and undercoordinated
rhombus-rich architectures of the jagged nanowires enhanced ORR mass
activity. Moreover, they employed RMD to simulate the formation of
jagged nanowires. Furthermore, they comprehensively analyzed the
structural properties of nanowires to explain how the jagged nanowire
could deliver high ORR activity based on RMD results. Specifically, they
computed the coordination number of surface atoms in jagged nano-
wires and confirmed the high-crystalline nature of jagged nanowires,
which was beneficial to the increased ORR activity. The considerably
high atomic stress could decrease the binding energy of adsorbents on
close-packed surfaces and enhance the surface activity. Additionally, the
unusually high number of rhombic structures on the surface was also
favorable for high activity. Huang et al. [233] developed a PtCo nano-
wire catalyst and fabricated the membrane electrode assembly (MEA).
The ORR mass activity of PtCo nanowires in MEA had a high level of

activity of 4.2 A mgPt
these nanowires showed excellent stability in accelerated tests. More-
over, Fan et al. [225] explored the morphologies of ionomer films and
the properties of oxygen transport near different catalysts including
nanowires using CMD simulations. Based on their CMD results, the
well-layered structure of ionomer films on nanowires formed broader
and shorter oxygen transport paths. Therefore, the local oxygen trans-
port resistance near nanowires was much lower than those near the
catalysts of nanosphere, core-shell, and nanoframe.

(cid:0) 1 at an ultralow Pt loading of 0.047 mgPt cm

The core-shell structure is also effective for improving ORR activity
and stability. The core-shell catalysts have Pt atoms as the ultrathin shell
and other metal elements as the core, which is effective for reducing the
Pt loading. G ̈ohl et al. [234] synthesized a Pt-based core-shell catalyst
with the titanium tungsten carbide core, which showed a higher specific
(cid:0) 2 and better stability than commercial Pt/C
activity of 0.69 mA cm
catalysts. Li et al. [208] developed a PtCo core-shell catalyst with a
2-atom-thick Pt shell (Fig. 21), which demonstrated a high mass activity
(cid:0) 1 and a low mass activity loss of 19 % after 30000
of 0.56 A mgPt
accelerated durability test cycles. Chong et al. [23] also developed a
PtCo core-shell catalyst with an extremely high mass activity of 1.77 A

(cid:0) 1 in the MEA testing. Moreover, the design of
mass activity of 0.52 A mgPt
atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles is also a promising
approach. The ordered intermetallic structure can effectively enhance
the ORR activity and stability, as well as the homogeneity of active sites.
Yang et al. [235] synthesized 46 kinds of ordered intermetallic catalysts

(cid:0) 1 and a high-power density of 1.17 W cm

using Pt with 16 other metal elements (Fig. 21) to develop a small
database and search for catalysts with high ORR activity. They found
that PtFe, PtCo, PtNi, and PtCu3 demonstrated high mass activities of
(cid:0) 1 in the MEA testing. Song et al. [236]
1.27, 1.52, 7.84, and 1.50 A mgPt
synthesized 18 Pt intermetallic catalysts using a novel small molecule
assisted impregnation method and achieved a high ORR mass activity of
(cid:0) 2 of MEA. Cheng
1.08 A mgPt
et al. [226] synthesized the subsize order intermetallic catalysts that
were confined in the mesopore carbon, achieving a high mass activity of
(cid:0) 1, and a high stability with only 18.5 % mass activity loss
0.92 A mgPt
after 30000 accelerated durability test cycles. Furthermore, they used
CMD simulations to reveal the transport behavior of oxygen and protons
in mesopore-confined subsize catalysts. Based on their CMD results, the
5 nm pores inside the mesopore could avoid ionomers from densely
covering catalysts, which exhibited the best performance for oxygen and
proton diffusion.

(cid:0) 2 with H2/O2 and 1 W cm

To thoroughly eliminate the use of Pt in CLs, Pt-free catalysts, such as
Fe-N-C in Fig. 21 [237], are also active in development. Adabi et al.
[238] developed a high-performing Fe-N-C cathode catalyst and ach-
(cid:0) 2
ieved a high peak power density of 2 W cm
with H2/Air and a good durability of more than 150 h. The Fe-N-C
catalyst developed by Li et al. [239] achieved a peak power density of
(cid:0) 2 using a ceria-assisted strategy, which preferentially hel-
0.496 W cm
ped generate active single-atom Fe sites in Fe-N-C catalysts. He et al.
[240] fabricated an atomically dispersed Co-doped C catalyst with a
C-shell confinement structure using the surfactant-assisted metal
organic framework (MOF) method and achieved a high-power density of
(cid:0) 2 with H2/O2. Wan et al. [241] optimized the cathode CL
0.87 W cm
structure with Fe-N-C catalysts to improve the exposure of inaccessible
Fe-N4 moieties and enhance the mass transfer in the CL. The power
(cid:0) 2 with
density with this novel design reached a high level of 1.18 W cm
2.5 bar H2/O2. Moreover, Wan et al. [227] synthesized a type of Fe-N-C
catalyst with nitrogen-coordinated iron clusters surrounding Fe-N4
active sites, to increase the stability of Fe-N4 active sites by 60 %. CMD
simulations were used to observe the vibration and amplitude of the
chemical bonds of Fe-N4 at different temperatures and further reveal
underlying mechanisms of increasing stability. Based on CMD results,
the existence of iron clusters yielded a pinning effect that inhibited the
thermal vibrations of the satellite Fe-N4, thereby reducing their ten-
dency for demetallation.

MD simulations have been applied in catalyst development as listed
in Table 6. MD method can simulate Pt atoms and other atoms as well as
their interactions. Hence, the RDF, coordination number, atomic dis-
tance, structure of multiple atoms, etc., all of which are related to the
catalytic activity of catalysts [94], can be comprehensively analyzed by
show the
MD simulations. Moreover, MD simulations
catalyst-electrolyte interface and the oxygen transport and adsorption
onto catalysts, which also highly affect reactions on catalysts [56,189,
205,225]. In theory, AIMD based on QM calculations can directly
compute the multi-step reaction process and catalytic activity of cata-
lysts, which is promising in catalyst development [242]. However,
AIMD has rarely been applied in catalyst development so far, due to its
expensive computational cost.

4.2. Catalyst support

Catalyst support forms the CL’s skeleton and conducts electrons. As
mentioned above, ionomer films cover the catalyst/support agglomer-
ates, increasing local oxygen transport resistance. Therefore, accessible
porous carbon as shown in Fig. 21 was proposed by Yarlagadda et al.
[243] to avoid the ionomer film coverage over catalysts. The accessible
porous carbon contains abundant nanoscale pores, which connect the
interior and exterior of carbon and hence protect the catalysts inside the
carbon from the ionomer film coverage. Moreover, oxygen molecules
and protons can easily penetrate pores to reach the catalyst surface. The
porous carbon has achieved high performance at a low Pt loading (<0.1

(cid:0) 2) in PEM fuel cells. Ramaswamy et al. [15] explored the ef-
mgPt cm
fects of pore size on the transport of oxygen molecules and protons and
found that too small pores (<2 nm) did not benefit the oxygen transport
to the catalyst surface, while too large pores (>8 nm) did not benefit the
homogeneous and continuous distribution of ionomer films and thus the
proton transport. Moreover, Ko et al. [16] found that a thinner carbon
shell was beneficial to the formation of shorter and less tortuous oxygen
transport paths, while larger interior mesopores had a larger space for
oxygen transport. Therefore, appropriate designs of nanoscale channels
and interior mesopores of porous carbon are necessary to enhance both
oxygen and proton transport. Moreover, Padgett et al. [244] found that
the interior pores of porous carbon could effectively restrict catalyst
migration and suppress catalyst coalescence and thus mitigate catalyst
degradation. Furthermore, MD simulations were used to explore the
oxygen and proton transport mechanisms in micropores and the
blockage effect of micropores on ionomers. You et al. [229] found that
the denser ionomer layer on the carbon surface near micropores could
restrict oxygen molecules from diffusing towards the pore opening. In
addition, the oxygen molecules that already entered micropores tended
to migrate along the pore’s inner surface with a specific and short
diffusion pathway. Zuo et al. [228] compared the ionomer permeation
through pores of 2 nm, 4 nm, and 6 nm, and found that the pores with an
opening of <6 nm could effectively block the entering of ionomers.
Moreover, the water molecules mainly existed in the middle of pores,
and as a result, the protons migrated via the water network close to the
middle of pores and the oxygen molecules migrated along the inner
surface of pores. Kikkawa et al. [62] computed the free energy profiles of
ionomer permeation through micropores using CMD simulations.
Computed free energy showed that the ionomer penetration in the water
solvent was more favored than that in the water/ethanol mixed solvent.
Therefore, the ionomer distribution inside micropores can be altered by
changing the solvent composition of catalyst inks.

Besides, the surface modification of catalyst support can improve the
homogeneous distribution of catalysts and ionomer films. The N-modi-
fied carbon developed by Islam et al. [245] achieved a highly homo-
geneous distribution of catalysts and ionomer films and reduced the
oxygen transport resistance by over 50 % at a low Pt loading of 0.034
(cid:0) 2 in comparison with traditional designs. Orfanidi et al. [246]
mgPt cm
also found that the N-modified carbon support could make ionomer
films distribute more homogeneously to avoid the local thicker ionomer
films and thus the high oxygen transport resistance. Ott et al. [247]
modified the carbon surface with N-functional groups (Fig. 21) and
found that the interaction between ionomers and N-functional groups
could effectively achieve a homogeneous coverage of ionomer films on
catalysts, which significantly reduced local oxygen transport resistance
at the low Pt loading. However, they also found that the N-modification
did not always result in a homogeneous distribution of ionomer films in
CLs [248]. The improved homogeneity may be attributed to other
physicochemical processes, which are still unclear. Hu et al. [249]
confined catalysts with an N-doped carbon shell, making catalysts
distribute more homogeneously on the carbon support and prevent the
catalyst agglomeration and detachment. Moreover, Yoshimune et al.
[230] carried out CMD simulations to investigate the interaction be-
tween ionomers and N-modified carbon. They found that the sulfonic
acid groups of ionomers were tightly adsorbed on the N-modified carbon
surface due to the electrostatic interaction, to form a water-rich layer on
the carbon surface. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the
homogeneous coverage of ionomer films on the N-modified carbon
surface have not been elucidated through MD simulations. Both porous
carbon and N-modified carbon are the promising catalyst support, which
can increase catalyst utilization, reduce local transport resistance, and
mitigate degradation due to catalyst agglomeration and detachment.

The applications of MD simulations in catalyst support development
are listed in Table 6. The TPB morphology that consists of catalysts,
catalyst support, and ionomers can be observed by MD simulations
(Fig. 21). Moreover, the critical oxygen transport behavior near the TPB

can be revealed using MD simulations (Fig. 21). The findings of TPB
morphology and mass transfer behavior are highly valuable for guiding
the optimization of catalyst support.

4.3. Ionomer materials

Ionomer films provide transport paths for protons and gas. There-
fore, developing ionomer electrolyte materials with high proton con-
ductivity and gas permeability is essential for improving PEM fuel cell
performance. PFSA, as a common ionomer material, has been modified
corresponding to its side chains and backbones to enhance the transport
of protons and gas molecules as shown in Fig. 21. Chowdhury et al.
[250] explored the effects of PFSA chemistry and found that the PFSA
with shorter side chains showed a better chain alignment and stronger
interactions between sulfonic acid groups and catalysts,
thereby
increasing the interfacial resistance between ionomers and catalysts.
The PFSA with a lower equivalent weight had low crystallinity and
improved the water uptake in PFSA ionomers, which increased the
thin-film permeability. They suggested PFSA ionomers with bulky
groups and large free volume to enhance mass transfer. Kodama et al.
[251] suggested that the two ways of shortening side chains and
modifying anionic groups needed to be considered to mitigate the
PFSA-induced ORR suppression (Fig. 21). Similarly, Poojary et al. [252]
found that the CL with short-side-chain ionomers showed 2–5 times
higher ORR activity than that with long-side-chain ionomers. Moreover,
the CL with short-side-chain ionomers exhibited higher proton
conductivity.

Moreover, the backbones of PFSA ionomers have also been modified
to enhance oxygen and proton transport. Macauley et al. [253] altered
ionomer backbones using a ring-structured group (Fig. 21) to achieve a
(cid:0) 2. This novel ionomer films on the
high MEA performance of 1.25 W cm
catalyst surface had porous structure that enhanced oxygen permeation.
Moreover, the novel ionomer film had a higher coverage of catalysts,
more homogeneous distribution, and lower
sulfonic acid group
adsorption on catalysts (i.e., low catalyst poisoning), all of which
improved fuel cell performance. Jinnouchi et al. [232] developed a
novel ionomer material using similar ring-structured backbones. More-
over, they used MD simulations to reveal the effect of ring-structured
backbones on oxygen permeation. Based on their MD results, the high
oxygen permeability was ascribed to the suppression of densely ar-
ranged structure near catalysts by incorporating the ring-structured
matrix. Similarly, Fang et al. [231] also employed MD simulations to
observe the oxygen transport behavior through the ionomers with
ring-structured backbones towards catalysts. They computed the oxygen
diffusivity and radial distribution function between the oxygen atoms in
oxygen molecules and carbon atoms using MD simulations and found
that the oxygen diffusivity was significantly increased and the oxygen
molecules more easily penetrated ionomer films to reach the catalyst
surface when using this novel ionomer. In addition, Zhang et al. [254]
developed an ionomer by incorporating ionic covalent organic frame-
work nanosheets in PFSA ionomers. The new ionomer’s porous structure
greatly enhanced proton conduction and oxygen permeation.

The applications of MD simulations in ionomer development are
listed in Table 6. The ionomer morphology highly affects the TPB and
local mass transfer. MD can explore the ionomer morphology, proton
conduction, and gas transport (Fig. 21), thereby evaluating the perfor-
mance of ionomer materials and guiding their designs.

4.4. CL architectures

CL architecture is also crucial for mass transfer and catalyst utiliza-
tion. At present, commercial CLs are usually fabricated by spraying the
catalyst inks onto a membrane or GDL to form a porous structure with
randomly arranged catalyst/support agglomerates as shown in Fig. 21.
This kind of fabrication technology has the advantages of low cost and
the unordered porous
easy large-scale manufacturing. However,

26

L. Fan et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101220

structure has a large tortuosity, leading to a high mass transfer resistance
and low catalyst utilization, as well as poor durability. For example,
Wang et al. [255] showed that the ORR activity was higher near the
cathode CL-membrane interface at high currents and thus lower catalyst
utilization occurred in other location. To mitigate these issues, gradient
design strategies, including the gradient distributions of Pt loading,
ionomer content, wettability, etc., were developed in many works. For
example, dual- [256] and multi-layered [257] CLs have been proposed
to improve the uniform distributions of the ORR rate and catalyst uti-
lization by adjusting local Pt loading and ionomer content. Roh et al.
[258] designed a hydrophilic-hydrophobic dual CL that had a hydro-
philic inner layer close to the membrane and a hydrophobic outer layer
close to GDL to better hydrate the membrane and avoided water
flooding at low humidities. The maximum fuel cell power density with
this novel dual-layer CL was improved by 28 %. Wang et al. [255,257]
detailly explored the distributions of local current density and over-
potential for the muti-layer configuration of CL using a theoretical
model. They found that the sub-layer adjacent to membrane played a
dominant role in the local reaction and overall current
for the
multi-layered CL. Lee et al. [259] developed grooved CLs and found that
the grooved structure enhanced the proton and oxygen transport,
achieving a 50 % higher performance compared to conventional CLs.

The ordered CL architectures with catalyst arrays or support arrays
have been developed to improve mass transfer, catalyst utilization, and
durability as shown in Fig. 21. Lagrichi et al. [260] fabricated a
support-free CL with well-ordered and oriented PtNi nanowires or
nanotubes directly embedded in the membrane. This novel CL with
(cid:0) 2 with
catalyst arrays achieved a low Pt loading of less than 0.1 mg cm
greatly improved mass activity and catalyst stability. Mardle et al. [261]
fabricated a catalyst array CL by depositing PtNi nanowires onto the
GDL, which showed a 2.84-fold enhancement in power density in
comparison with traditional Pt/C CLs. Moreover, they also developed a
novel ordered CL formed by aligned N-doped carbon nanotubes sup-
porting short Pt nanorods, which were deposited directly onto the GDL
[262]. This novel design achieved a 1.23-fold improvement in power
density with less than half of Pt loading, compared with traditional Pt/C
CLs. However, this design of nanotube-supported catalysts easily causes
the aggregation of catalyst particles and thus reduces the ECSA [263].
Moreover, water flooding more easily occurs in this ordered CL at high
current densities [9].

Besides, electrospinning technology has been employed to fabricate
a novel CL architecture with layered fibers as shown in Fig. 21. This kind
of CL architecture has a more ordered structure and higher porosity that
provides more space for gas supply and water removal, compared with
traditional Pt/C agglomerate CLs. The electrospun nanofiber CL devel-
oped by Waldrop et al. [264] achieved a power density increase of
20–40 % in comparison with traditional CLs. At low humidities, the
electrospun nanofiber CL could store more water to hydrate the mem-
brane and electrolyte, thereby achieving a higher proton conductivity
and ECSA. Yoshino et al. [265] fabricated an ionomer nanofiber scaf-
folding CL architecture, which had continuous pores for gas supply and
water removal. This kind of CL showed a better performance than the
traditional Pt/C CL under the relative humidities of 30–100 %. Addi-
tionally, Chan et al. [266] fabricated a carbon nanofiber scaffolding CL
architecture, which showed a 5-fold power density in comparison with
traditional CLs. Liu et al. [267] evaluated the cold start capability and
durability of electrospun nanofiber CLs. Based on their experimental
results, more micropores inside the nanofibers possibly reduced the
freezing probability of super-cooled water and thus achieved a better
cold start. However, electrospinning has strict requirements on the ink
properties, electric field, and environmental setting, which make it
difficult to control the preparation processes of CLs [264]. As a future
direction, these novel CL architectures with low mass transfer resistance,
low Pt loading, and high degree of order are promising approaches for
the development of high-performance low-cost PEM fuel cells.

Due to the limitation of computational cost, MD is difficult to be

applied for the porous structure at a larger scale in CLs (Fig. 21). In this
case, the mesoscale or macroscale simulation methods, such as LB [268,
269] and FVM [270,271], are more appropriate to investigate the mass
transfer and reaction behavior at a larger scale in CLs. Although MD
simulation plays an important role in CL development, it can’t simulate
all the phenomena in CLs. Therefore, combination of multiple simula-
tion methods is essential in developing CLs (Fig. 21).

5. Challenges and future prospects

(cid:0) 1 and 30 $ kW

Nowadays, major efforts on the PEM fuel cell development have been
made to achieve the ambitious targets of high power density, low cost,
and high durability. The volumetric PEM fuel cell stack increases to over
(cid:0) 1, while the cost of PEM fuel cell system, including stack,
4.0 kW L
(cid:0) 1 at an annual manufacturing volume of 500,000
decreases to 60 $ kW
systems [6–9]. However, there is still a gap between the current level
(cid:0) 1 [6–9]. The designs of
and ultimate goals of 9.0 kW L
CLs are crucial to achieving these ambitious goals on basis of the fact
that the cost of precious catalysts accounts for ~40 % of the stack cost in
large-scale production [9] and the catalyst activity and mass transfer
capability directly affect the output performance of PEM fuel cells.
Therefore, the novel catalyst designs, including the nanowire [94,206,
207,233], core-shell structure [208,209,234], ordered intermetallic
structure [226,235,236], and Pt-free catalysts [237–241], have been
developed to achieve perfect activity and stability. However, major
challenges are present in their catalytic performance when applied in
actual PEM fuel cells [9]. Further optimization designs of TPB and CL
architecture are highly needed to increase ECSA and decrease mass
transfer resistance, thereby maintaining their high activity in actual
applications. Furthermore, catalyst
to be further
improved to increase catalyst utilization, reduce mass transfer resis-
tance, and improve catalyst stability. Therefore, accessible porous car-
bon [243,244] and surface-modified carbon [245–249] are preferred.
The micropore size and mass transfer behavior inside porous carbon
deserve more studies. For ionomer materials, improving proton con-
ductivity and oxygen permeability, and mitigating catalyst poisoning
are the main development trends. Therefore, tailoring the side chains,
such as shortening the side chains [250–252], and altering the back-
bones, such as adding a ring-structured matrix [232,253] are promising
approaches. Moreover, the novel ordered CL architectures with gradient
distribution [256–258], ordered arrays [260–262], and fiber arrange-
ment [264–267] deserve further studies for enhancing mass transfer and
reducing Pt loading. In addition, the CL fabrication processes, including
the mixing of ionomers, catalysts, and solvent and the solvent evapo-
ration process need to be further optimized, in order to reasonably
control the morphology of TBC. Therefore, the structural evolution
mechanisms during ionomer dispersion and solvent evaporation pro-
cesses need to be further revealed.

support needs

CL development involves complex multi-parameter optimization,
which poses a big challenge to the costly and time-consuming experi-
ments. For CLs, the ionomer film thickness and catalyst particle size are
approximately several nanometers. Therefore, MD is an appropriate
method to investigate the transport and structural characteristics of CLs
and can play an important role in CL development. In catalyst devel-
opment, CMD simulations can investigate the gas adsorption and
transport onto catalysts as well as the ionomer film morphology, while
AIMD and RMD simulations can investigate chemical reaction processes
on catalysts. The size, morphology, atomic types, and atomic arrange-
ment of catalysts can be optimized based on the underlying mechanisms
revealed by MD simulations. In catalyst support development, CMD
simulations can explore the morphology and local mass transfer of TPB.
Moreover, a larger system with more Pt/C particles can be simulated
using CGMD, to investigate the TPB morphology among multiple Pt/C
particles. TPB in actual CLs highly impacts the catalyst utilization and
local mass transfer resistance, which can be evaluated by MD simula-
tions. In ionomer development, CMD simulations can study the ionomer

morphology, proton conduction, gas permeation, and mechanical
deformation, while AIMD can be applied to study the proton conduction
taking into account the quantum effects. The various ionomer properties
revealed by MD simulations can effectively guide the optimization of
ionomer materials. In the preparation of CLs, CMD and CGMD can
observe the structural evolution behavior in the processes of the ink
mixing and the solvent evaporation to form pores. Therefore, the pa-
rameters of preparation, including the solvent type, solvent content,
ionomer content, catalyst content, temperature, etc., can be optimized
using MD simulations. Moreover, the ice nucleation behavior in CLs can
also be explored by CMD simulations, in order to guide the CL designs to
improve the cold start capability. In short, most of the crucial behavior
in CLs can be comprehensively understood through MD simulations,
thereby providing theoretical support for CL development.

To meet the demands of CL development, MD simulations still face a
few major challenges as shown in Fig. 22. The first challenge is regarding
force fields (potential energy models), which impact simulation accu-
racy. Although the potential energy models for ionomers [36,42,43,67,
136,137], water [144–147], hydronium [36,153], Pt [44,45], and car-
bon [140] have been used as discussed above, the specific potential
energy models to describe the interfacial interactions among different
components are still rare, leading to the diffusivity in simulating the
interfacial properties. Additionally, none of previous MD simulations on
PEM fuel cells aimed to investigate the ice nucleation process in CLs
involving ionomers, catalysts, and carbon. It is questionable whether the
current potential energy models are still applicable at subzero temper-
atures. Therefore, specific high-precision potential energy models with
respect to CLs need to be developed and verified. MLPs through training
the QM data are promising to increase accuracy of potential energy
models. However, the problems of MLMD in training data generation,
long-range interactions (e.g. electrostatic interaction), transferability,
and scalability remain to be solved. In addition, the initial simulation
systems, including the initial velocities and coordinates of atoms, are
random, thereby affecting simulation accuracy. A small difference in the
initial molecular systems may lead to completely different simulation
results. Therefore, multiple simulations with different initial configu-
rations under one identical condition need to be performed to eliminate
any random bias.

Secondly, the number of atoms in simulation systems and simulation
time are greatly limited by the computational burden. The numbers of
atoms in AIMD, RMD, and CMD are about ~100, ~300000, and ~mil-
lions, respectively, with the physical time of ~100 ps, ~10 ns, and ~100
ns, respectively [32]. The CGMD, that represents groups of atoms by CG
beads has the potential to significantly reduce the computational burden
of pair-wise interactions and can allow up to ~100 billion atoms in
system and the physical time of >1 ms [32]. Currently, developing ac-
curate CG potential through training MD data using machine learning is

a promising approach. For example, previous works constructed the
frameworks of CGnets [272], CGSchNet [40], and deepCG [38] to ach-
ieve the CG mapping and develop CG potentials. Moreover, most of the
mass transfer and structural evolutions in CLs are long-timescale events.
However, most of the MD simulations can simulate a time only from
nanoseconds to microseconds, which can even take a few days. At pre-
sent, enhanced sampling techniques have been developed to allow MD
simulations to capture longer-timescale phenomena, such as TPS [58],
FFS [59], Metadynamics [60], and Integrated Tempering Sampling (ITS)
[273]. In addition, GPUs are useful to accelerate MD simulations
considering that the calculations of pair-wise interactions are simple.
The GPU accelerator package has been implemented in the LAMMPS
software.

Thirdly, extracting and analyzing useful

information from MD
simulation data presents a significant challenge. A large amount of data
with the velocities and coordinates of over millions to billions of atoms
for over billions of time steps can be created by a single MD simulation.
Some macroscopic properties, such as density, diffusivity, solubility,
permeability, and resistance, can be computed based on pre-specified
functions. However, in many cases, the desired phenomena are diffi-
cult to specify in advance, such as the oxygen transport paths in ionomer
films. Although the commonly used post-processing software, such as
VMD and OVITO, provides ready-to-use analysis methods, such as visual
analysis, we need to develop customized analysis scripts with respect to
specific phenomena, which is challenging. For example, Fan et al. [155]
computed the oxygen density distribution near catalysts and the oxygen
number reaching different positions of catalysts by developing custom-
ized analysis scripts to reveal the oxygen transport paths near catalysts.
Using machine learning to train a large amount of MD simulation data is
a promising approach to revealing underlying mechanisms and
achieving multi-parameter optimization. For example, Li et al. [274]
extracted the structural features from MD simulation data and used a
customized deep learning framework to reveal water transport mecha-
nisms in ionomer films.

Finally, model validation is a crucial part in evaluating the model
reliability. Although MD is an atomic- or molecular-level simulation
method, certain simplification and assumption are also made to enable
MD simulations as discussed in Section 2. Verification of MD simulations
is a big challenge because microscopic information is difficult or unable
to be experimentally obtained. In the past, major validation activities on
CLs were to compare the macroscopic properties statistically obtained
by MD simulations with experimental results, such as density [42,43,
127,131,133,161,167–169], diffusivity [42,133,169–171], solubility
[44,46,161,175], permeability [44,46,161,175], and transport resis-
tance [44–46,175]. However, the accuracy of macroscopic properties
cannot ensure the reliability of the microscopic results obtained by MD
simulations. In future, more detailed microscopic information needs to

28

L. Fan et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101220

be obtained by emerging state-of-art experiment technologies to support
MD simulation validation.

Furthermore, it is essential to assess whether the issues at hand can
be effectively addressed through MD simulations. Limited by the
computational cost of MD, a large space that requires a long physical
time is difficult to be simulated by MD. Other methods, such as LB and
FVM, are more appropriate to explore the mass transfer and electro-
chemical reactions at a larger scale in CLs instead of MD method. Efforts
have been made to develop a multiscale simulation method by coupling
MD, LB, FVM, and other methods. For example, Tong et al. [275]
coupled MD and LB by exchanging velocities of fluid, while Chen et al.
[276] coupled LB and FVM by exchanging velocities and concentrations.
However, the computational efficiency and transferability of these
coupled methods should be further improved.

5.1. Summary and concluding remarks

In this review, MD modeling aspects in CL development for PEM fuel
cells are discussed. This work presents the fundamentals of MD simu-
lation, overview of MD simulations in CL applications,
latest de-
velopments of catalysts, catalyst support,
ionomer materials, CL
architectures, and roles of MD in CL development, as well as associated
challenges and prospects. CLs are a key component of fuel cells since
they are the sites where the electrochemical reactions take place. CL
development is essential for achieving a high-performance cost-effective
PEM fuel cell. Simulation is an effective tool for CL development and
optimization, in addition to experimental study which is usually limited
in some aspects such as considerable time of implementation, high cost,
and non-in-situ. Considering that the catalyst particle size and ionomer
film thickness are usually about several nanometers, MD simulations are
suitable to study CL’s transport and structural properties.

The main findings are summarized as follows.

1) MD simulations can be categorized into a few groups, including
CMD, RMD, AIMD, CGMD, and latest MLMD. The computational cost
and accuracy decrease in the order of AIMD, RMD, CMD, and CGMD.
MLMD represents a promising approach to bridge the gap between
the computational efficiency of CMD and the accuracy of AIMD.
AIMD and RMD are capable of exploring chemical reactions on cat-
alysts and proton conduction in ionomers by allowing the bond
breaking and formation. Moreover, AIMD can simulate the detailed
quantum effects (e.g. proton tunnelling) in CLs. CMD simulations,
which are most commonly used, can study morphologies, gas
adsorption, mass transfer, and ice nucleation in ionomers and TPB.
They can also explore nanoscale mechanical deformation of CLs.
Furthermore, CGMD enables the study of larger systems with more
Pt/C particles and ionomers, facilitating the exploration of complex
TPB morphologies among multiple Pt/C particles and structural
evolution during ink mixing and solvent evaporation. MLMD can
effectively obtain specific potential energy models for CLs, such as
interfacial interaction potentials at TPB, by training QM data using
machine leaning. Currently, the model validation of MD simulations
primarily involves comparing macroscale properties, such as density,
diffusivity, solubility, permeability, and transport resistance, ob-
tained from experiments. Validation of microscopic structures and
transport properties is rare due to the experimental challenges
associated with obtaining these data.

2) MD simulations have been conducted to reveal the structural and
transport properties in CLs. These studies encompass a wide range of
phenomena, including the morphologies of bulk ionomers with
varying side chain lengths at different water contents; proton con-
duction properties via hydroniums and hopping in bulk ionomers;
gas diffusion, solution, and permeation properties in bulk ionomers;
mechanical deformation properties of ionomers such as Young’s
modulus and yield stress; oxygen adsorption properties on catalysts
with the co-adsorption of oxygen and other species; ionomer film

morphologies on catalysts; morphologies of TPB;
local oxygen
transport through ionomer films to catalysts; ice nucleation proper-
ties on catalysts; ionomer dispersion properties in inks; and ionomer
assembly on Pt/C during solvent evaporation. As a powerful tool, MD
simulations enhance our understanding of crucial underlying
mechanisms in CLs.

3) In CL development, MD simulations have been extensively utilized to
elucidate key experimental observations and guide design optimi-
zations. Specifically, in nanowire catalyst development, MD simu-
lations revealed the increased ORR activity with respect to structural
characteristics of nanowires and the decreased local oxygen trans-
port resistance with respect to ionomer film morphology on nano-
wires. For Fe-N-C catalysts, MD simulations demonstrated increased
stability in terms of the vibration and amplitude of the chemical
bonds of Fe-N4. In porous carbon development, MD simulations
revealed the effect of ionomer penetration into micropores and the
transport behavior of oxygen and protons inside micropores. In N-
modified carbon development, MD simulations revealed specific in-
teractions between ionomers and N-modified carbon surface. Addi-
tionally, in ring-structured ionomer development, MD simulations
highlighted the increased oxygen permeability in ionomers with
ring-structured backbones. Overall, MD simulations hold significant
promise for broader applications in CL development.

4) However, challenges persist in MD applications in CLs. The devel-
opment of specific force fields (potential energy models) for CLs re-
quires further advancement. Although traditional potential energy
models have been employed in MD works of CLs, models that accu-
rately describe the interfacial interactions among different compo-
nents remain rare. MLPs hold promise in addressing this issue.
However, challenges such as training data generation, modeling
long-range interactions, ensuring transferability, and achieving
scalability remain to be overcome. The computational burden limits
both the number of atoms in simulation systems and simulation time.
CGMD can significantly reduce the computational burden of pair-
wise interactions, allowing for systems with approximately 100
billion atoms and simulations exceeding 1 ms. However, designing
appropriate CG mappings and developing high-accuracy CG force
fields present significant challenges. Furthermore, enhanced sam-
pling techniques are helpful to allow MD simulations to capture
longer-time phenomena. Analyzing large volumes of MD data and
extracting useful information pose substantial challenges. Using
machine learning to train a large amount of MD data is a promising
approach to reveal underlying mechanisms and achieving multi-
parameter optimization. Moreover, improving the validation of MD
models by considering both the macroscopic and microscopic prop-
erties obtained experimentally is essential. Not all problems in CLs
can be fully addressed by MD simulations largely due to the limita-
tion of computational cost. Developing multiscale simulation
methods by integrating MD with other methods, such as LB and FVM,
offers a viable pathway to simulate the mass transfer and reactions in
whole CLs.
