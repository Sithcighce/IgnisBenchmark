    "standard_answer": "The NH2 + HO2 → H2NO + OH reaction serves as a crucial chain-branching pathway in ammonia combustion kinetics. At intermediate temperatures (800-1200K), HO2 radicals become significant due to suppressed H + O2 → OH + O reactions. When NH2 reacts with HO2, it produces H2NO and OH radicals. The OH radical then participates in NH3 + OH → NH2 + H2O, sustaining the chain reaction. The H2NO intermediate subsequently decomposes via H2NO + O2 → HNO + HO2, regenerating HO2 radicals and forming HNO which leads to NOx formation. This reaction sequence accelerates ammonia consumption while influencing NOx emissions, as shown by Glarborg et al.'s kinetic modeling studies where the branching ratio between NH2 + HO2 pathways determines combustion efficiency.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Reaction R17 (NH2 + HO2 → H2NO + OH) is highly sensitive in the NO formation mechanism [241], and reaction R17 has been reported as the RDS [196,428].",
      "2": "As R17 is a chain-propagation reaction vital under lean [315,429] and high pressure conditions [196], Miller and Glarborg first tried to estimate the rate constants."

    "standard_answer": "Using RRKM theory for NH3 → NH2 + H unimolecular decomposition: The high-pressure limit rate constant k∞ = A·T^n·exp(-Ea/RT) = 5.00×10^15 T^-0.45 exp(-105000/RT) s^-1. The pressure-dependent rate is calculated via the inverse Laplace transform of the master equation solution. For ΔEdown = 130·(T/298)^0.8 cm^-1, the collision efficiency βc = ΔEdown/<E> where <E> ≈ 2kT. The reduced pressure k/k∞ = [M]/([M] + k∞/βcZ), with Z ≈ 10^10 s^-1 as collision frequency. At 1000K and 10 atm: ΔEdown = 130·(1000/298)^0.8 = 328 cm^-1, βc ≈ 328/(2×0.695×1000) = 0.236.

    "standard_answer": "Hydrogen blending enhances laminar burning velocity (SL) of NH3 through three mechanisms: 1) Radical pool augmentation: H2 → H + OH via H + O2 → O + OH increases [OH] by 3-5x compared to pure NH3 flames (measured via LIF). The OH accelerates NH3 consumption via NH3 + OH → NH2 + H2O (k=2.8×10^13exp(-1750/T) cm³/mol/s). 2) Thermal effect: H2 oxidation raises adiabatic flame temperature by ~200K (from 1950K to 2150K at φ=1.0), exponentially increasing reaction rates. 3) Transport enhancement: H2's high diffusivity (DH2-air ≈ 0.78 cm²/s vs DNH3-air ≈ 0.23 cm²/s) improves radical transport to flame front.

The Sherwood number Sh ≈ 3.66 (laminar flow) gives kmt ≈ DNH3/dh ≈ 0.2 cm/s for DNH3=10^-5 m²/s, requiring washcoat thickness <50 μm to avoid pore diffusion limitations. 2) Thermal management: The endothermic reaction (ΔH=46 kJ/mol NH3) creates axial temperature gradients (>50K/cm). The Nusselt number Nu ≈ 4.36 gives h ≈ 500 W/m²K, necessitating conjugate heat transfer analysis. 3) Pressure drop: For L=5 cm, u=1 m/s, ΔP ≈ 32μLu/dh^2 ≈ 0.5 bar (μ=2×10^-5 Pa·s), risking membrane integrity.
