Fouling in gas turbines is caused by airborne contaminants which, under certain conditions, adhere to
aerodynamic surfaces upon impact. The growth of solid deposits causes geometric modifications of the
blades in terms of both mean shape and roughness level. The consequences of particle deposition range
from performance deterioration to life reduction to complete loss of power.

Due to the importance of the phenomenon, several methods to model particle sticking have been pro-
posed in literature. Most models are based on the idea of a sticking probability, defined as the likelihood
a particle has to stick to a surface upon impact. Other models investigate the phenomenon from a de-
terministic point of view by calculating the energy available before and after the impact. The nature of
the materials encountered within this environment does not lend itself to a very precise characterization,
consequently, it is difficult to establish the limits of validity of sticking models based on field data or
even laboratory scale experiments. As a result, predicting the growth of solid deposits in gas turbines is
still a task fraught with difficulty.

In this work, two non-dimensional parameters are defined to describe the interaction between inci-
dent particles and a substrate, with particular reference to sticking behavior in a gas turbine. In the first
part of the work, historical experimental data on particle adhesion under gas turbine-like conditions are
analyzed by means of relevant dimensional quantities (e.g. particle viscosity, surface tension, and kinetic
energy). After a dimensional analysis, the data then are classified using non-dimensional groups and a
universal threshold for the transition from erosion to deposition and from fragmentation to splashing
based on particle properties and impact conditions is identified. The relation between particle kinetic
energy/surface energy and the particle temperature normalized by the softening temperature represents
the original non-dimensional groups able to represent a basis of a promising adhesion criterion.

1. Introduction

Gas  turbines  never  operate  in  perfectly  clean  air.  Land-based
and  offshore  units  ingest  salt  and  particulate  present  in  the  at-
mosphere at low altitudes. Aircraft engines ingest large amounts
of sand during operation in desert environments, or during flight
through  volcanic  ash  clouds.  Solid  particles  can  also  make  their
way inside a gas turbine through the fuel, e.g. as coal fly ash in
units burning pulverized coal. The effect of solid particles on gas
turbine components is twofold: the particles can erode the blade
surfaces or they can stick to them. In both cases the impact on
performance and operability is negative.

The  behavior  of  solid  particles  impinging  on  a  wall  is  deter-
mined by the flow conditions, properties of the particles and by
the temperature. As demonstrated in [1] , particle adhesion is not
a  linear  phenomenon  for  which  several  contributions  affect  the
final  result  of  particle  impact  at  the  same  time.  Depending  on
the material, temperature and impact conditions (related to both
particle and substrate) the adhesion or rebound is not easily ex-
trapolated by using similar experimental tests or numerical mod-
els. Starting from the result collection reported in [1] , in the coal
combustion  field  of  research,  many  efforts  have  been  made  in
estimating  and  improving  the  comprehension  of  deposition  and
slagging.  Material  characterization,  experimental  procedure,  and,
sometimes,  equations  model  and  basic  criteria  can  be  borrowed
from this research field to the gas turbine field. Starting from these

findings, two main conclusions can be drawn. At low temperature,
the particles are likely to bounce off the wall and cause damage
by  erosion.  At  high  temperatures,  the  particles  become  soft  and
can stick to the wall. As a consequence, erosion is the dominant
damage mechanism in fans and compressors or in turbines oper-
ating at low Turbine Entering Temperature (TET). In this case, the
damage is irreversible and is related due to an increase in rough-
ness and to uncontrolled modifications of the shape of the blades,
typically around the leading edges. Adhesion is the primary dam-
age mechanism at high temperature and takes place mainly around
the first turbine stage in machines operating at high TET – where
gas and wall temperature values are the highest. Therefore, sur-
face modification afflicts all parts of a gas turbine: coated and un-
coated, cooled and uncooled surfaces all experience shape and sur-
face modification from the baseline [2] .

Contaminants are able to stick to blade surfaces in very differ-
ent ways. The deposits can contaminate multiple stages of the ma-
chinery as a consequence of the different type, nature, and path
of a single particle. Several experiments are reported in the liter-
ature concerning the deposition to hot components. Particle adhe-
sion to hot parts has a number of adverse effects on the operation
of the gas turbine. Solid deposits can incapacitate cooling holes –
or entire cooling passages if the particles are carried by the cool-
ing air itself – leading to reductions in component life [3] . Further-
more, solid deposits modify the effective shape of the airfoils, their
roughness  and,  most  crucially,  the  capacity  of  the  nozzle  vanes.

Fig. 1.  Gas turbine nozzle contamination: a) land-based power unit in which the contaminants are due to the operation with low-grade fuels (sub-bituminous ash derived
from coal mined) [12] , and b) aero engine contamination due to volcanic ash particle [9] .

When the capacity of the nozzle vanes is reduced, the compres-
sion system is moved to a higher working line and can eventually
stall, leading to interruption of power.

Land-based turbines are usually exposed to relatively low con-
centrations of contaminants over long periods of time and can be
protected by suitably designed filters. The main impact on land-
based turbines of solid particles in the air or in the fuel impact is
normally represented by the loss of performance – permanent or
reversible [4–7] . Filters cannot be used in aeronautical applications
– except  in  the  smallest  units.  In  aircraft  engines,  damage  usu-
ally appears through erosion in the compressor and fouling in the
turbine. It is known that erosion damage progresses rather slowly
whereas fouling in the turbine can lead to loss of power in a mat-
ter of seconds, as reported in several encounters with volcanic ash
clouds [8–10] . A formalization of these phenomena is reported in
[11] that define a predictive model for estimating the engine sus-
ceptibility to volcanic ash by means of several parameters related
to the sticking and shedding phenomena.

In Fig. 1 , an example of the turbine section contamination due
to different sources is reported. As mentioned, land-based gas tur-
bines are well protected by the filtration system, but, in the case
of low-grade fuel operation, the contamination of the first turbine
nozzle represents one of the primary causes of the performance
losses. In this sense, Fig. 1 a reports a first nozzle contamination
[12]  that  involves  the  entire  blade  surface  as  well  as  the  cool-
ing holes. Regarding the aircraft engine contamination, the volcanic
ash particles affect the turbine nozzles as reported in Fig. 1 b [9] .
The deposits appear more localized with respect to the previous
example, but at the same time, these deposits are characterized
by a higher hardness due to the solidification process of the semi-
molten particles.

Particle  deposition  on  gas  turbine  components  has  attracted
much  attention  because  of  its  practical  implications  and  a  large
number of experimental studies is available [13,14] . These studies
cover  the  whole  range  of  conditions  of  (i)  full  scale  gas  turbine
unit, (ii) wind tunnel testing or hot gas facilities using stationary
cascades, able to reproduce the same conditions of gas turbine op-
eration and finally, (iii) wind tunnel testing or hot gas facilities us-
ing coupon as a particles target. The experimental analyses have
been supported by - and have given inspiration to - increasingly
realistic  mathematical  models.  These  models  are  widely  used  in
the computational fluid dynamic analysis for the study of this phe-
nomenon.

Two types of model exist according to the approach followed
to  describe  particle  sticking.  The  first  model  type  relies  on  the
definition  of  a  quantity  called  sticking  probability.  The  sticking
probability  represents  the  likelihood  a  particle  has  to  stick  to  a
substrate (clean surface or pre-deposited layer). This probabilistic

approach is required to overcome inaccuracy and the uncertainty
of the experimental tests on which these models are based. The
sticking probability value may be regarded as the statistically rep-
resentative outcome of a series of independent experiments car-
ried out under the same conditions. For example, turbulent phe-
nomena may afflict the particle dynamic changing the impact ve-
locity which could assume a different value for every single impact
for the same test conditions. In addition, the definition of a prob-
ability function may consider the actual variation experienced by
the gas turbine in terms of particle size and shape, material com-
positions, operating conditions and conditions of the blade surface
that are difficult-to-be-considered in the laboratory tests.

The  second  model  type  is  related  to  the  comparison  of  the
properties of a particle and a threshold value which considers the
particle dynamics, its material properties and energy available be-
fore and after the impact. This deterministic approach can only be
used when the conditions of the flow, the substrate and the parti-
cles are known in detail.

The validity of the available models could be assessed, in prin-
ciple, by applying them to the wealth of experimental data pub-
lished  on  particle  deposition.  However,  these  data  cover  a  very
wide range of flow velocities, temperatures, particle materials, and
target surfaces. Therefore, they cannot easily be grouped or com-
pared to each other unless suitable non-dimensional quantities are
defined. Non-dimensional maps and non-dimensional correlations
which describe the behavior of molten or liquid particles are avail-
able in literature [15–19] and can be used with advantage to study
the problem at hand because the solid particles ingested in a gas
turbine are heated by the combustor and are thereby softened or
completely molten before hitting the walls of the turbine.

From a physical point of view, the conditions for adhesion, re-
bound or break-up are determined by how much of the initial ki-
netic energy of the particle is absorbed by the deformation work
upon impact and by the adhesion energy with the substrate and
how much is still available to remove the particle, or its fragments,
from the wall. In addition to these forces, the surface tension in-
teracts with the particle deformation, and the resulting surface en-
ergy is a function of the contact area between the particle and the
substrate [15] that is directly related to the particle deformation.
These relations are conveniently expressed in terms of the particle

where the density ρ, normal impact velocity v , diameter d , sur-
face tension γ , and viscosity μ represent the particle properties
and motion prior to the impact [16] . Both the Reynolds and We-
ber numbers change with temperature because of the temperature
dependence  of  viscosity,  surface  tension  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,
density.

Using  non-dimensional  parameters,  generalized  maps  can  be
formed showing different regimes as stick, rebound, spread, break
up, and splash for the interaction between sprays and heated walls
[17] . Moreover, it is possible to predict the droplet behaviors like
stick, rebound, spread, break-up and splash in terms of only two
parameters, one non-dimensional (Weber number) and one dimen-
sional  (wall  temperature).  A  similar  approach  has  been  adopted
to  describe  the  performance  of  droplets  deposition  for  printing
[18] . In this case, by using two non-dimensional parameters (We-
ber number and Reynolds number), it has been possible to define
whether ink droplets splash or not during printing [19] .

1.1. Contributions

The  aim  of  the  present  work  is  to  identify  particle  deposi-
tion  regimes  in  the  hot  parts  of  gas  turbines  in  terms  of  non-
dimensional quantities. To this effect, over seventy (70) particle de-
position tests reported in the literature are studied. The collected
tests are selected because they were conducted using similar ma-
terials (silica-based type contaminants, such as silty, coal-like, and
volcanic particles) and took place in conditions relevant to depo-
sition on the hot parts of gas turbines. The tests were carried out

in a number of configurations, covering full engines, single blades,
coupons or blade cooling channels. The tests provide particle stick-
ing results as a function of particle velocity, temperature, dimen-
sions,  etc.  Only  in  a  few  cases,  the  sticking  phenomenon  is  re-
ported in detail with the quantitative estimation of mass deposits
determining the per-order-of-magnitude approach adopted in the
present work.

Details  about  particle  size  and  chemical  composition  used  in
each  experimental  test  are  listed  as  well  as  the  flow  conditions
such as velocity and temperature values. In addition, the target ty-
pology and its dimension are reported (if available in the litera-
ture) in order to characterize each impact test. Starting from this
collection,  a  critical  post-process  is  carried  out  by  means  of  di-
mensional (e.g. particle kinetic energy, temperature, etc.) and non-
dimensional groups (e.g. particle Reynolds number, particle Weber
number, etc.). With more details, the first part of the present re-
view paper includes the following points:

• collection  and  comparison  of  the  literature  on  experimental

particle impact tests related to gas turbine fouling;

• application of the most used particle sticking models for gas
turbine particle adhesion, highlighting how each model works
and where it fails if compared with the actual test results;

• a detailed review of the predictive model for particle viscos-
ity is added and a sensitivity analysis coupling particle charac-
teristics (e.g. chemical composition) and impact conditions (e.g.
temperature) with the experimental results is proposed in or-
der to highlight the implications of the use of different sticking
models together with particle viscosity models.

In the second part, an innovative approach gives the opportu-
nity to link the present experimental results with some new per-
spective.  The  phenomenology  reported  in  literature  dating  back
thirty (30) years is summarized in terms of two non-dimensional
parameters representing the ratio between the particle tempera-
ture and the glass transition temperature on one hand, and the ra-
tio between the available kinetic energy and the surface energy on
the other hand. The non-dimensional map clearly shows a num-
ber of different regimes, fitting very well with reported observa-
tions in terms of deposition and erosion phenomena. Furthermore,
the map shows that the phenomena taking place in gas turbines
are amenable to generalizations in different fields of research (e.g.
printable fluids). The non-dimensional map proposed by the Au-
thors  represents  a  prediction  tool  in  relation  to  the  particle  de-
position and erosion phenomena and give a new insight into the
gas turbine fouling prediction. The conceptual steps, as well as the
overall scenario in which the present work is developed, are re-
ported diagrammatically in Fig. 2 .

2. Particle sticking mechanisms and models

The adhesion of contaminant particles to the blade surfaces is
determined by (i) the material of the interacting bodies (particle,
surface, third substance and carrying medium), (ii) the surface con-
ditions, (iii) the particle size, (iv) the impact velocity and (v) the
impact angle. The conditions under which these contaminants stick
to blade surface are still unclear. Over the years, several contribu-
tions related to the fouling phenomenon have been proposed and
this paragraph aims to summarize the models describing the par-
ticle sticking. Three particle sticking models have been considered
for the data post-process, which is mainly referred to as the basic
criteria, such as particle viscosity, velocity, and energy. Other for-
mulations which are derived from these basic criteria are listed as
well, but they are not considered for the data-process.

The  present  section  reports  in  detail  (i)  the  sticking  models
used for predicting particle adhesion on hot gas turbine sections
and (ii) the predictive models for estimating particle characteris-
tics (viscosity, surface tension and softening).

2.1. Particle sticking models

2.1.1. Critical viscosity model

This model, widely used in the literature, compares particle vis-
cosity to a reference viscosity at which sticking starts. In addition,
the  model  could  account  for  the  stickiness  of  the  deposit  itself
[20] . The sticking probability was assumed to be inversely propor-
tional to viscosity. In terms of sticking probability, viscosity at or
below the critical viscosity is assumed to have a sticking probabil-
ity of unity whereas at other particle temperature, according to the
relation
P visc = μc /μ
(cid:3)
P visc =

μc /μ μ > μc
μ ≤ μc
1

(4)

(5)

where P
visc is the sticking probability related to the viscosity effect
and μc  is the particle critical viscosity while μ is the viscosity of
the particle at its temperature. This model is implemented assum-
ing that the critical viscosity value corresponds to the particle vis-
cosity at the softening temperature ( μsoft ). Softening temperature is
a predetermined temperature value, and it is a function of the par-
ticle material that could be calculated/measured according to the
standard ASTM – D1857-04 ( Standard test method for fusibility of
coal and coke ash ) [21] . This standard definition allows a univocal
and reproducible application of the critical viscosity method.

Many authors have applied this method and, in some cases, val-
idated its results with experimental tests [22–27] . Other contribu-
tions have improved the model by introducing a transition across
the critical viscosity value [22] and by extending its validity at a
lower temperature (lower compared to the melting temperature)
[28] . A detailed explanation of these models can be found in the
paragraph  Predictive  models  for  particle  properties  of  the  present
Chapter.

At a lower temperature, energy losses due to particle-surface
impact will determine whether an impacting particle will be able
to leave the surface. These energy losses are a function of impact
parameters such as the properties of the particle, impact velocity
and angle. This last formulation of the model states the probability
of sticking should be a function of energy losses during a collision
and is calculated from the coefficient of restitution model as
P e = f ( e ) = e

−c R

(6)

The  coefficient  of  restitution  R  is  therefore  considered  as  an
index of the energy dissipated at the impact: the lower it is the
higher the dissipative viscous effect of the impact. Its effect is ac-
counted  for  through  an  exponential  law  where  the  coefficient  c
∼6.5. Since the model for the sticking must still depend on the
viscosity  of  the  particle  (with  respect  to  μsoft  considered  as  the
threshold for ideal adhesion), the final formulation of this model
is the one reported below:
P = min ( P e + P visc ; 1 )

(7)

Another formulation is related to the definition of the critical
value  of  the  viscosity,  which  could  relate  the  effects  of  particle
softening with the particle kinetic energy. In this case, the defi-
nition of the critical viscosity is the following
μc = A E B
kin
where A and B are two coefficients able to fit the experimental
results related to the specific material. For example, in the case of
glass particles [29] , A = 5 ·10 −12 and B = −1.78.

(8)

This model is strongly dependent on the particle material com-
position. Low-melting elements or mixtures could be responsible
for early particle adhesion. For this reason, this model is only suit-
able when the characterization of the material particle and its be-
havior according to the temperature is available.

2.1.2. Critical velocity method

This  model  is  based  on  the  comparison  between  a  threshold
value of velocity and the particle velocity [30] . Other contributions
are related to the representation of the particle-boundary layer in-
teraction. Numerical studies on the interaction between the parti-
cle and boundary layers are reported in the literature [31] , with
greater attention to the effect of turbulence on particle dispersion,
deposition on turbine blade surfaces and detachment from the sur-
faces [32,33] .

As mentioned, the velocity of an impinging particle is one of
the parameters that drive the sticking process. If its value is lower
than a threshold (critical velocity) the particle sticks to the surface.
The threshold value is strongly dependent on the particle material
and its mass. The formulation suggested in [30] for the critical ve-
locity uses the following equation

v 2
c =

2 W A
m

−1 + μ2
R 2
where W
A is the work of adhesion and R is the coefficient of resti-
tution. According to the formulation of Brach and Dunn [30] , the
critical velocity is referred to the normal direction with respect to
the target surface. The work of adhesion [34] could be expressed
as

where C and p are constants that can be derived from experimental

as a material index (particle or substrate), the parameter k
i is de-
fined according to Young’s modulus E

Y and Poisson’s ratio ν as

k i =

(12)

Also for this model, the particle properties, and in particular its
Young’s modulus, are sensitive to the temperature and need to be
estimated using empirical correlations. This model was applied in
the case of gas turbine contamination by ash using the following
relation for the particle’s Young modulus [35]

The application of the present model requires accurate values
of the Young modulus of the particle and surface. This procedure is
not a standard (contrary to the critical viscosity method for which
the definition of the critical viscosity equal to the particle viscosity
at  the  softening  temperature  allows  the  results  standardization).
The lack of universally accepted ways to evaluate material prop-
erties may be the reason for discrepancies in predictions obtained
(i) in different conditions with the same material or (ii) with dif-
ferent materials for the same test conditions.

A  deposition  model  that  includes  elastic  deformation,  plastic
deformation, adhesion, and shear removal is reported by Bons et al.
[37] . Its predictions were compared to five literature cases: quartz
on aluminum, ash on stainless steel, sand on stainless steel, ash on
Inconel at high temperature and ash on vane cascade. This model
is used in the numerical analysis reported by Prenter et al. [38] and
Forsyth et al. [39] after tuning the model parameters. A different
model was proposed by Agati et al. [40] for the numerical mod-
eling of particle deposition that occurs in gas turbine hot sections
from 500 K to 1500 K. The transition between these two extreme
conditions is modeled through a temperature-driven modification
of the mechanical properties of both particles and target surface.
A third method is proposed by Yu and Tafti [41] as a modification
of the former model [42] and it is based on the relation between
particle temperature and yield stress at a high temperature start-
ing from 10 0 0 K. The model prediction was compared against ex-
perimental data obtained with sand particles. As mentioned, more
details about these models are reported in the paragraph Predictive
models for particle properties of the present Chapter.

diameter.

2.1.3. Energy-based model

Energy  balance models are  based on  comparing the  available
energy just before the impact to the energy dissipated by the par-
ticle during its deformation. The model predicts sticking if all the
available  energy  is  dissipated  to  deform  the  particle  and  to  ad-
here to the surface. The main parameters are the kinetic energy
of the particle, its viscosity and surface tension, and the surface
energy  or  contact  angle  [43,44] .  The  method  can  study  deposi-
tion  on  an  existing  layer  by  a  suitable  choice  of  the  properties
of the substrate. It can even be used to obtain the restitution co-
efficient for use in critical viscosity model calculations [45] . This
model takes into account the particle deformation due to the im-
pact,  without  considering  the  behavior  of  particle  viscosity  such
as non-Newtonian effects or possible sintering effects after particle
impact. Fig. 3 reports the phases involved in the particle impact
phenomenon.

The model is based on the estimation of the parameter E ∗ that
stands for the excess of energy and indicates whether all energy
is dissipated during wetting and deformation. The particle will re-
bound if E ∗ > 0 and it will stick otherwise. The parameter E ∗ is
defined according to Kleinhans et al. [43] :

∗ =

E

ξ 2 ( 1 − cos α) +

25
172

50
129

ξ −1 − 3
43

ξ 2 . 3 (1 − cos α) 0 . 63 − 1 > 0

where α is the contact angle and ξ is the particle spread factor.
The  spread  factor  represents  the  particle  maximum  deformation
and, if d max is the maximum footprint particle diameter when the
particle hits the surface, the spread factor is defined as

(17)

ξ =

d max
d

(18)

Several empirical tests and spread factor quantifications are re-
ported  in  the  literature  [46–51]  and,  for  this  reason,  a  detailed
evaluation of the particle spread factor value predictions will be
carried out in the present work.

As mentioned, the model compares the kinetic energy to the
energy dissipated by viscosity and the work done against surface
tension to modify the surface area of the particle. These energies
are evaluated using semi-empirical correlations. The criterion E ∗ >
0 is determined mainly by the value of the spread factor ξ . This
can be appreciated by inspecting Fig. 4 , where E ∗ is shown as a
function of ξ for different values of α. In particular, it can be seen
that particle adhesion takes place for ξ > 0.4 for most values of α
of practical interest. Therefore ξ = 0.4 will be used as the threshold
value in the present work for particle adhesion.

Sticking  mechanisms  and  deposit  formation  mechanisms  are
based on the presences of a third substance or second phase at the
particle/surface interface [52] . The presence of a third substance is
usually invoked at low temperature. An example is the formation

from  the  basic  ones  and  tuned  according  to  the  experimental
results  obtained.  All  of  these  models  were  used  for  estimating
the particle deposition in the gas turbine and in agreement with
their  hypothesis,  they  could  be  used  for  fouling  prediction  with
a certain confidence. In Table 1 , these models are listed together
with their peculiarities, such as, the basic criterion on which the
model is based and the main positive and negative peculiarities.

The analysis proposed by Srinivasachar et al. [29] , shows that
the  particle  kinetic  energy  affects  the  critical  viscosity  value  at
which  sticking  starts.  The  experiments  have  shown,  for  a  single
sample of coal, that the critical viscosity value decreases for a spe-
cific particle impact velocity and diameter. The sticking efficiency
transition as a function of temperature was not as sharp, due to
the  overlaying  effects  of  ash  size  and  composition  distributions.
It  increases  the  reliability  of  the  former  critical  viscosity  model.
The models proposed by Sreedharan and Tafti [22] and Singh and
Tafti [57] are based on the critical viscosity criterion as well, but,
in these attempts, the Authors have extended the prediction ca-
pability of the model to lower temperature. Hypothesis related to
the energy dissipation at the impact imposes to the precise charac-
terization of the particle structural characteristics. The last model
based on the critical viscosity criterion is proposed by Jiang et al.
[58]  and  is  able  to  account  for  the  wall  temperature  effects  on
the particle sticking capability. The model takes into account ash
thermo-physical properties, particle viscosity and metal wall tem-
perature by means of simplified relation and two model constants.
Moving to the critical viscosity criterion, the proposed model
involves the mechanical properties of the particles. The model pro-
posed by Agati et al. [40] , is based on the critical velocity criterion:
the model is developed according to the correlation between tem-
perature and material properties by means of the chemical com-
position, Temperature based model considers material properties
(such as Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio) and material com-
position for a temperature range between 500 K and 1500 K. This
interval is modeled through a temperature-driven modification of
mechanical properties of particles and target surfaces. The model
can also predict the coefficient of restitution for particles bouncing
region.

Based  on  the  aim  of  estimating  the  coefficient  of  restitution,
four models are developed. In this case, the sticking phenomenon
can be detected when the restitution coefficient is null. The model
reported  in  Yu  and  Tafti  [42] ,  takes  into  account  the  contact
models  for  elastic,  elastic-plastic  and  plastic  compression  stages,
followed by a recovery model based on the model of Stronge [59] .
Then,  a  new  elastic  recovery  model  is  proposed  with  molecular
adhesive  forces  acting  on  the  contact  area.  The  model  is  more

of deposits on compressor blades, where particles encountered wa-
ter droplet or oily substances [53] . The third substance could gen-
erate favorable conditions for particle sticking especially when the
particle  is  solid  and  its  adhesion  is  driven  only  by  electrostatic
forces. In this case, in fact, the presence of third substance could
change the action of capillary forces as well as the effects of the
inertia and the correspondent energy dissipation during impact al-
lowing particle sticking. The presence of a second phase is invoked
also  to  model  deposition  on  hot  gas  turbine  sections  in  which
contaminants are softened or completely molten [54] . For adhesion
of particles to occur, either they must be semi-molten or a molten
phase  must  be  present  on  the  blade  surfaces.  The  low-melting
compounds generated by the increment of the particle temperature
act as a bridge between the particle and the blade surface. There-
fore, the sticking probability is dependent on a number of char-
acteristics, such as particle temperature, viscosity, surface tension
and wettability [55,56] . In the light of this background, the pre-
diction of particle adhesion is based on a two-step approach. The
first step deals with the prediction of the particle/surface proper-
ties while the second step deals with the estimation of the sticking
probability (or any other measure of adhesion) based on them.

2.1.4. Predictive sticking models

With the reference of basic models presented in the latter para-
graphs (critical viscosity, critical velocity, and energy-based mod-
els), in this paragraph, different model formulations are reported.
In the literature, several predictive sticking models exist starting

110

accurate  in  predicting  the  coefficient  of  restitution  compared  to
the Stronge and Jackson-Green [60] models. The model is largely
sensitive on the mechanical properties of sand to the grain size.
With the reference of this model [42] , the Authors have improved
the formulation in [41] for modeling the collision of micro-sand
particles by means of the adhesion forces, size and temperature
dependency  of  particle  mechanical  properties.  The  base  model
is  validated  and  the  proposed  temperature-dependent  model  is
validated  against  experiments  on  the  impact  of  micro-sand  par-
ticles for impact velocities at different temperatures. However, it
is validated only against experiments that involve sand particles.
Bons et al. [37] proposed a physics-based model which includes
elastic  deformation,  plastic  deformation,  adhesion,  and  shear
removal. The model accounts for fluid shear removal, elastic and
plastic deformation, and adhesion. The model is not fully validated
in terms of the deposition prediction because of the dependency
between temperature and material properties.

A different approach is adopted in [61] . The model proposed by
Casari et al. [61] , investigates the deposition process under a sta-
tistical perspective. This fouling model uses only the energy con-
tent of the particles, based on temperature and kinetic energy, to
estimate the sticking probability. However, in a similar way of pre-
vious models, the model constants and the applicability limits are
not checked against experimental results.

After this brief review of the present sticking models, it is clear
how the major issue is related to the extension of predictive ca-
pability as a function of different particle chemical compositions,
mechanical  properties  etc.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  improve
the models in order to extend the prediction capabilities together
with the limitation of the use of model constants which are usually
specifically tuned for each application.

2.2. Predictive models for particle properties

Different  predictive  models  used  for  particle  characteristics
such  as  viscosity,  surface  tension,  softening  and  density  are  re-
ported.  The  formulations  reported  in  the  following  sections  are
useful for the subsequent data post-process based on literature ex-
perimental data.  The  particle deposition on  hot  gas  turbine sec-
tion  experiments  was  carried  out  using  similar  materials  that
affect  the  power  unit  in  the  actual  operating  conditions  such
as  sandy,  volcanic  and  coal-type  particles.  All  of  these  contami-
nants belong to the class of material called silica-based and are
characterized  by  well-known  interaction  between  their  constitu-
tive ions. Silica melts are based on the strong covalent bonding be-
tween silicon and oxygen forming a network structure. The glassy
silica  network  can  accommodate  many  different  cations.  Three
main categories exist, depending on the interaction of cations and
network: (i) glass formers (Si 4 + , Ti 4 + , P 5 + ) which form the basic
anionic  polymer  unit,  (ii)  modifiers  (Ca 2 + ,  Mg 2 + ,  Fe 2 + ,  K + ,  Na + )
which disrupt the polymeric chains by bonding with oxygen and
terminating  chains,  and  (iii)  amphoteric  (Al 3 + ,  Fe 3 + ,  B 3 + )  which
act either as glass formers or as modifiers. Modifier ions disrupt
the glass structure and thus tend to lower viscosity. Amphoteric
ions can act as glass formers when they combine with modifiers
ions which balance their charge, thus forming stable metal-oxygen
anion groups that can fit into the silicate network. If insufficient
modifier  ions  are  present  in  the  glass,  amphoteric  cations  (Al 3 +
and Fe 3 + ) can act as modifier ions [62] .

2.2.1. Particle viscosity models

Several test methods exist to measure silica melts viscosity: ro-
tating crucible, rotating bob, falling body, oscillating plate, oscillat-
ing viscometer and Static Light Scattering (SLS) [63] . The methods
contain provisions to guarantee uniform temperature zone during
the measuring processes. Each method has its applicability range,

confidence band and requires additional data (such as density and
surface tension). The rheological behavior of silica melts [64] can
be assess using standard test methods, according to ASTM D 2196–
15 [65] , which are able to evaluate whether the slag has transi-
tioned  from  Newtonian  to  non-Newtonian  flow  at  the  measure-
ment temperature. Unfortunately, these test methods are defined
for a specific range of shear rate (0.1 – 50) s − 1 and developed for
measuring the rheological properties of the liquid phase only.

Although  the  widespread  use  of  rotational  test  methods  for
the assessment of rheological properties of non-Newtonian flows,
several oscillatory tests can also be used to examine all kinds of
viscoelastic  materials  from  low  viscosity  materials  to  melts  and
dispersions.  The  rheological  behavior  of  both  viscous  and  elas-
tic portion can be investigated by using these tests which allow
the determination of the values of dynamic rheological properties,
such as complex shear modulus (G ∗), shear storage modulus (G’)
and shear loss modulus (G’’). In particular, G ∗ can be supposed as
the rigidity of material, while G’ is the deformation energy stored
by  the  material  during  the  test  and  it  describes  the  elastic  be-
havior of the material. The G’’ modulus represents the viscous be-
havior of the material and the deformation energy employed and
then dissipated due to frictional forces that occur during the test.
Moreover, another important rheological parameter is the loss fac-
tor or damping factor (tan δ) that is calculated as the quotient of
the loss and the storage modulus and it represents the ratio be-
tween the viscous and the elastic portion of the viscoelastic de-
formation behavior. This parameter is useful for the evaluation of
tacky behavior of the material and, more specifically, the presence
or the absence of stringiness characteristics. In particular, values of
tan δ lower than one and storage modulus (G’) greater than shear
modulus (G’’) are typical characteristics of viscoelastic gels or solid
materials [66] .

Oscillatory  tests  can  be  performed  at  different  conditions  in
which specific parameters, such as frequency, amplitude, and tem-
perature, can be kept at a constant value or can be free to vary.
For  example,  dynamic  mechanical  analysis  (DMA)  test  provides
that frequency and amplitude, together with dynamic-mechanical
shear conditions are kept at a constant value, while in dynamic-
mechanical thermoanalysis (DMTA) tests, the only variable param-
eter is the temperature. In this latter case, this test provides infor-
mation about the influence of temperature on physical properties
of the material, such as specific structural modifications. According
to ISO 6721–10 [67] , an oscillatory rheometer with parallel-plate
geometry is used to determine the dynamic rheological properties
of polymer melts with complex shear viscosity values up to ∼10
MPa ·s. Widespread measuring systems can be used to perform os-
cillatory tests, such as a concentric cylinder, cone-and-plate, and
the aforementioned parallel-plate systems. For the sake of brevity,
in this review, the measuring systems have been named in a brief
list. For an up-to-date overview of rheological tests and a meticu-
lous summary of typical measuring systems, please refer to Mezger
[66] .

Each  material  has  its  own  temperature-dependent  charac-
teristics,  furthermore,  each  particle  is  subjected  by  different
temperature-history in a gas turbine flow path. For this reason, the
aim of the present analysis is to compare the experimental data
with dimensional and non-dimensional parameters using the avail-
able data reported in the literature.

Over  the  past  century,  several  equations  have  been  proposed
relating the viscosity of arbitrary melts to temperature-dependent
characteristics and to specific composition constants [68] . Most of
these  are  proposed  for  predicting  material  viscosity  for  specific
material  composition  and  sometimes,  their  validity  is  limited  to
a certain viscosity ranges. In the present review, seven (7) meth-
ods  are  considered.  They  are  based  on  data  extrapolation  from
temperature-viscosity trends of coal and volcanic samples similar

to those responsible for gas turbine hot section fouling. In addition,
all of the selected methods are able to predict the particle viscos-
ity based on the composition and temperature. Each method is ap-
plied considering its limits according to the particle composition,
beyond of the absolute value of the predicted viscosity [69–75] . In
this way, each method can be included or excluded a priori only
based on the particle composition useful for automated calculation
or routine easy-to-be-implemented in numerical simulations.

The  considered  models  are  based  on  different  correlations
obtained  considering  different  physical-chemical  criteria.  The  S 2
[70] and Watt-Fereday (WF) [71] postulate that the viscosity de-
pends on temperature following Arrhenius’ law. This corresponds
to a description of the flow of silicates in terms of transition prob-
ability and vacancy distribution in the structural lattice. The NPL
model  by  Mills  and  Sridhar  [69]  is  also  based  on  the  Arrhenius
equation used to describe the temperature dependence of slag vis-
cosity and correlates the slag composition to the optical basicity
of the material. In 1962, Weymann [76] proposed another equa-
tion resulting from the same deduction considered for the Arrhe-
nius model with the addition of an extra temperature-dependent
parameter. This model demonstrated a valid correlation with ex-
perimental  data  and  a  successful  description  of  the  relationship
between  viscosity  and  temperature.  The  models  that  are  based
on  Weymann  equation  [76]  are  Sreedharan  and  Tafti  [72]  (S&T),
Riboud  et  al.  [73]  (RRLG)  and  Streeter  et  al.  [74]  (SDS).  Another
equation that links the viscosity with temperature was indepen-
dently  proposed  by  Vogel  [77] ,  Fulcher  [78]  and  Tamman  and
Hesse [79] in the 1920s and it is the base of the model presented
by Giordano et al. [75] (GRD). In this case, a third adjustable com-
position parameter is introduced into the equation to improve the
performance of the model and to better emphasize the dependence
of  temperature  on  silicate  melts  viscosity.  This  model  is  specif-
ically realized for predicting temperature-viscosity trends of vol-
canic ashes.

All model coefficients, constitutive equations, and applicability
limits are reported in Appendix A divided according to the model.
In addition, the accuracy of the model coefficients and the confi-
dence band related to each model are described in details.

2.2.2. Particle softening model

In addition to the particle viscosity, another basic particle char-
acteristic is the particle softening temperature. This property is the
key value for calculating particle adhesion according to the criti-
cal viscosity method. In order to post-process the literature data
related to the particle deposition on hot gas turbine sections, the
calculation of the present quantity is required.

For  the  estimation  of  the  softening  temperature,  three  main
approaches exist. The first one is related to a visual method de-
scribed in the standard procedure of ASTM – D1857-04 ( Standard
test method for fusibility of coal and coke ash ) [21] , the second one
is carried out with a ThermoMechanical Analysis (TMA) approach
while  the  third  one  is  related  to  a  thermal  analysis  by  means
of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) approach. The setup of
these different methods has been carried out over the years due
to the controversial question related to the deformation tempera-
ture. In the literature, in fact, it has been emphasized that the ini-
tial deformation temperature is not the temperature at which the
ash melting begins, and many coal ashes have been found to start
melting at temperatures far below the initial deformation temper-
atures  [80] .  Therefore,  in  this  section,  the  three  approaches  are
briefly described.

In accordance with ASTM – D1857-04 ( Standard test method for
fusibility of coal and coke ash ) [21] , the softening temperature (ST)
is  defined  as  the  temperature  at  which  triangular  pyramid  pre-
pared from the material (see sketch n °1 in Fig. 5 ) has fused down
to a spherical particle which is characterized by the height equal

Fig. 5.  Critical temperature points taken from ASTM – D1857-04 [21] .

to  the  width  at  the  base  (see  sketch  n °3  in  Fig.  5 ).  The  soften-
ing temperature has been accepted as the critical temperature that
is commonly referenced in the evaluation of the characteristics of
coal  ash  [81] .  The  ash  fusion  test  (AFT)  is  considered  the  most
widely used procedure for determining the temperature at which
the different stages of the ash transformations (softening, melting
and flow) take place in order to assess the deposition characteris-
tics of the material [82] . The fusion temperature values are deter-
mined by heating a prepared sample of molded coal in a gas-fired
or electric furnace conforming to ASTM D1857-04 [21] . The defor-
mation of the molded ash cone is monitored during the increase of
temperature and, according to Fig. 5 , the four (4) critical temper-
ature points (fluid – FT; hemispherical – HT; initial deformation
– IT;  softening  – ST)  are  determined.  Moreover,  the  response  of
the sample to thermal treatment is generally quantified by optical
pyrometer or thermocouple. An alternative approach for the eval-
uation of the four (4) critical temperature values, applied to vol-
canic  ash  samples,  consists  in  the  use  of  thermogravimetry  and
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) [83,84] . Mechanically, the
evolution of characteristic temperature and the geometrical trans-
formations of the cone define the ability of the sample to sinter,
stick or spread and wet the surface [85] . Nevertheless, the standard
test [21] can be susceptible to subjective assessment because of the
visual evaluation of critical temperature points [86] . The standard
procedure is recognized as not a very precise method failing the
prediction of the fusibility temperature by over 40 K [87] as a func-
tion of the amphoteric content. In addition, it was found that the
deformation temperature is not the temperature at which initial
melting begins as normally perceived and the hemisphere temper-
ature is below the liquidus temperature.

The TMA methodology evaluates the progressive shrinkage of
ash and it is suitable for characterizing the sintering and melting
behavior at temperatures lower than the standard method. In ad-
dition, the precision of this technique is greater than the standard
one,  reducing  the  inaccuracy  due  to  the  measurement  method.
However,  this  accurate  methodology  cannot  be  applied  to  ashes
from biomass combustion [80] and in this case, the use of the DSC
technique  appears  the  best  solution.  This  methodology  is  based
on the evaluation of any mass changes by means of the compari-
son between the ash behavior against the reference material. With
this procedure, any deviation in terms of energy corresponds to an
evaporation or melting process with an accurate estimation of the
most ash fusibility temperature values.

Despite  the  background  of  conventional  techniques  for  deter-
mining the transformation temperature, the evaluation of the crit-
ical temperature values from the chemical composition can be a
difficult task because of the unknown correlation between the in-
teracting  factors.  In  the  present  paper,  starting  from  the  parti-
cle characteristics reported in the literature, empirical relations to
compute the particle softening temperature as a function of the
composition proposed by Yin et al. [88] were used. This model is
much easier and direct than other statistical methods through the
possibility to omit the mathematical correlation between the vari-
ables. In addition, the aim of the present study is to compare the
experimental literature data and, for this reason, particle softening

2.2.3. Particle surface tension model

The third particle characteristic useful for applying the particle
sticking methods is the particle surface tension. In the literature,
several  contributions  are  related  to  the  measurement  of  surface
tension values of slags and silicate melts [89–96] . Ternary or more
complex slags, as well as coal ashes, are taken into consideration.
These analyses are mainly focused on the estimation of the tem-
perature effects on the surface tension values. Even if, these contri-
butions report very detailed slags and ashes characterizations, both
in terms of chemical composition and surface tension values, they
are mainly focused on the high-temperature values at which these
materials  are  characterized  by  the  liquid  phase.  For  this  reason,
the actual slag and ash characterization cannot be applied to the
present study,  due  to  the different temperature ranges at  which
gas turbine operates (lower temperature values than the slag/ash
characterization). Therefore, in the present work, the particle sur-
face tension is calculated using a chemical-temperature dependent
correlation based on the principle that the surface tension can be
expressed as a linear function of the composition [97]
γ = (cid:9) ( γi m i )
(24)
where γ is the surface tension corresponding to each oxide i and
m is its molar fraction. The surface tension of each oxide is taken
from literature correlations [98,99] . Table 2 reports the equation of
the relation γ = f ( T ) used in the present analysis. The contribution
of potassium oxide and titanium dioxide are not considered.

By means of this approach, the different chemical composition
can be considered in the estimation of particle surface tension. In
addition, with the use of the linear function, the particle surface
tension is computed according to the precise correlation between
temperature and surface tension of every single oxide.

2.2.4. Particle density model

Several  models  for  density  calculation  have  been  provided
through the years [100–102] . The possibility to calculate the par-
ticle density starting from the chemical composition give the pos-
sibility to overpass the experimental characterization, even if, the
approximation related to the use of a general correlation may af-
fect the validity of the results. However, the measurement and/or
the calculation of the particle density is usually used for the esti-
mation of the particle mass that is, based on the present literature,
less important than other particle characteristics such as viscosity,
softening temperature, and surface tension. One of the most com-
mon methods is proposed by Bottinga et al. [103] , based on the
sum of the contribution of all components except Al
3  and the
other due to the contribution of Al
3 . This distinction is due to
the different approach used in literature to estimate the apparent
partial volume fraction of the aluminum silicate. With this model,
the densities, ρ, of molten slags can be obtained by the following
two equations

where the sum of Eq. (25) is taken over all oxide components ex-
cept the aluminum trioxide. In the Eq. (25) X is mole fraction of
component i , while V 0 terms represent the apparent partial volume
of slag constituents. They are constant and derived independently
from an analysis of volume-composition relations in alumina-free
silicate  liquids.  In  Eq.  (26) ,  M  represents  the  sum  of  the  molar
weight for the given slag. The apparent partial molar volumes of
3  are  polynomial  functions  of  composition  in  the
SiO
density  model  proposed  by  Mills  and  Keen  [104]  for  multicom-
ponent slags. Based on [103] , the Authors adjust the partial mo-
lar volume values ( V 0 ) achieving certain success in calculated data
with an uncertainty of 2%. Different model constants provided by
Bottinga et al. [103] and Mills and Keene [104] for calculating V 0 of
various slag constituents are listed in Table 3 . In the present work,
the apparent partial volume of slag constituents reported [104] are
used.

3. Experimental data of gas turbine particle deposition

Deposition tests in conditions representative of the hot parts of
a gas turbine have been conducted over the years with a number
of different materials. The tests involve five principal types of par-
ticles [105] : sand, ash, coal, bituminous coal, and lignite.

ment of the deposit thickness by means of the three-dimensional reconstruction based on laser scanner detection [120] .

Sand is defined as mineral particles of diameter 2 mm to mi-
cronized powder. In the gas turbine field of research, sandy parti-
cles are usually referred to Arizona Road Dust (ARD) silty samples.
This sandy powder takes inspiration from the standard powder of
ISO 12103–1 (A1, A2 A3, and A4) [106] , but the size and chemical
composition of particle used in the deposition tests could be dif-
ferent from the standard one due to the mixing, filtration, sieving,
and processes applied before the tests.

Ash  comprises  all  pyroclastic  particles  or  fragments  ejected
from  a  volcano,  irrespective  of  size,  shape  or  composition.  The
term is usually applied to an air-fall material characterized by a
characteristics diameter less than 2 mm.

Coal is a carbon-rich mineral deposit formed from the remains
of fossil plants. The process of coalification results in the produc-
tion  of  coals  of  different  ranks  such  as  bituminous  coal,  lignite,
and anthracite. Each rank marks a reduction in the percentage of
volatiles and moisture and an increase in the percentage of car-
bon. According to this definition, ASTM standard [107] proposed a
detailed coal classification based on the content of carbon, volatile
matter and calorific limits. Unfortunately, this classification is not
completely useful to understand the physical characteristics of the
contaminants involved  in  gas  turbine  degradation.  Physical  char-
acteristics such as viscosity and surface tension are dependent on
the chemical composition and structure (e.g. crystalline or amor-
phous)  of  the  contaminants.  In  addition,  it  is  important  to  note
that the chemical composition of slag and its correspondent origi-
nal coal ash could be different. As reported by Streeter et al. [74] ,
slags chemical composition could change due to the depletion of
iron oxides species or to the enhancement in alumina content dur-
ing heating/melting processes. At the same time, high-temperature
values generate the volatilization of the sodium oxide that could
change the slag viscosity. These behaviors enhance the difficulties
related  to  the  characterization and classification of  the contami-
nants that affect hot sections.

Particle deposition is investigated in order to understand tur-
bine  section  contamination  and  the  interaction  between  cooling
holes and particle deposition. Accelerated tests are frequently used
to recreate the actual gas turbine condition using in-house exper-
imental test bench. For example, accelerated deposition testing is
realized within 4 h that cover 10,0 0 0 h of actual gas turbine op-
eration [108] . Sometimes, in order to study specific problems, de-
position tests are conducted using a coupon instead of gas turbine
cascade [109–124] . In this type of test, the particle deposition oc-
curs on specifically-designed target, usually characterized by sim-
plified geometry in order to guarantee a certain flow and temper-
ature  fields.  In  this  case,  the  experimental  procedure  allows  the
proper correlation between particle impact conditions and deposi-
tion phenomenon based on the criterion that, all of the injected
particles are characterized by the same impact conditions such as
temperature, velocity, and incoming angle. In addition, given the
simplified geometry of the coupon, detailed evaluation of several
peculiarities such as (i) surface roughness of the deposited layer,
(ii)  effects  of  the  cooling  hole  array,  (iii)  deposits  thickness  and

(iv) influence of the substrate temperature on the particle sticking
capability can be easily carried out. In Fig. 6 , an example of this
evaluation is reported. In particular, Fig. 6 a shows the evaluation of
deposit surface roughness, Fig. 6 b depicts the influence of the pres-
ence of cooling holes on the particle deposition pattern and, finally,
Fig. 6 c reports an evaluation of the deposit thickness by means of
a three-dimensional detection carried out with a laser scanner.

Earliest contributions are related to deposits due to fuel con-
tamination.  Several  studies  can  be  found  in  literature  [125–135]
but  no  specific  details  about  particle  sticking  probability  is  re-
ported,  or  the  chemical  compositions  is  too  different  from  the
silica-based  materials  [136] .  Analytical  schemes  were  developed
for extracting sticking coefficients from the measured weight gain
data,  particle  size  spectrum,  and  particle  density  and  composi-
tion  [56] .  The  influence  of  the  particle  temperature  was  one  of
the first studies reported in the literature [137] . The particle tem-
perature determines the appearance of different composites with
different characteristics. For example, in the temperature interval
(80 0 – 180 0) K, the multi-component solution comprises oxides,
sulfates, silicates, and aluminosilicates. Below 1100 K, low-melting
alkali sulfate solutions are the predominant components, whereas
above  about  1500 K,  molten  oxides  constitute  most  of  the  liq-
uid phase. At high temperature, vapor deposition driven by ther-
mophoresis force becomes important. Differences in deposits were
encountered for pressure and suction sides where diffusion phe-
nomenon works as a leading actor [138,139] .

At  the  same  time,  the  first  studies  on  the  effects  of  volcanic
ash  on  aero-engines  were  published.  Tests  with  different  power
unit using a unique facility able to generate realistic environmen-
tal conditions of particle-laden clouds under controlled laboratory
conditions are carried out [140–142] . The results show the varia-
tion of the power unit performance during the test (a few minutes)
highlighting the deterioration over a small period. Evaluations of
blade erosion and deposition patterns are also proposed. This type
of  studies  are  not  widespread  in  literature  and  only  in  the  last
years, new studies have been proposed related to simply particle
deposition [143–145] , cooling holes blockage [146,147] and inter-
nal cooling hole clogging [148] . Cooling holes clogging represent
the most detrimental phenomenon that occurs in gas turbine hot
section, especially for aero-engines. Fig. 7 reports literature experi-
mental results showing the occupied area due to particle adhesion
inside the cooling hole. More recently, Shinozaki et al. [149] and
Naraparaju et al. [150] use a micro gas turbine for studying vol-
canic ash adhesion at different load and for different blade coating
materials, respectively.

With the increase in usage of gas turbines for power genera-
tion and given that natural gas resources continue to be depleted,
alternative types of fuel have been tested. Examples of alternative
fuels  are  coal-derived  synthetic  fuels.  Coal-derived  fuels  could
contain  traces  of  ash  and  other  contaminants  that  can  deposit
on  vane  and  turbine  surfaces.  Experimental  tests  and  numerical
analyses are devoted to the comprehension of the effects provided
by  bituminous  and  sub-bituminous  particles  on  the  gas  turbine

114

deposits thickness influences the heat transfer and, through exper-
imental tests, it is possible to correlate the thickness and the heat
transfer over the operating time [160] .

Finally, some attempts to use a sort of thermal similitude for
studying particle adhesion were proposed [161–164] . These exper-
imental tests were based on the similarities between melting ash
and wax/PVC particles. Latter materials have lower values of melt-
ing temperature and, using thermal scaling techniques, the deposi-
tion pattern could be assumed as representative of actual gas tur-
bine particle deposition.

4. Literature data collection

The experimental results related to particle deposition on cas-
cade and/or coupon reported in the literature, are obtained with
different (i) material (ii) size and (iii) working conditions such as
velocity and temperature. These different working conditions im-
ply  several  difficulties  in  comparing  deposition  results  obtained
from different experimental tests. Different material compositions
determine, for example, different values of particle viscosity even
if the tests are carried out at the same particle temperature. The
same phenomenon affects also the surface tension value (closely
related to the surface energy), that, in addition with the viscos-
ity, drives the adhesion phenomena at the particle/surface interface
[34] . On the other hand, differences in impact velocity and particle
dimension values determine different im pact mechanisms and par-
ticle deformation related for example to the particle kinetic energy.
In the light of these considerations, in this paragraph, all the
experimental results related to particle deposition on the hot gas
turbine section are summarized. Starting from the information re-
ported in every single work, particle composition and temperature
are used to calculate viscosity and surface tension based on the re-
lations available in literature and reported earlier. Coupling these
values with particle velocity, density, and dimension, the calcula-
tion  of  the  particle  adhesion  according  to  the  analytical  models
(critical  viscosity,  critical  velocity,  and  energy-based  models)  are
performed, highlighting pro and cons of each method. Special at-
tention is given to the particle viscosity which is considered the
most important parameter for judging the particle adhesion or re-
bound phenomena.

4.1. Experimental test conditions

Tables 4–6 report the experimental data available in literature
related to particle deposition in gas turbine hot sections for silty,

nozzle [151] . Several studies were realized in order to increase the
effects of these contaminants on gas turbine hot section fouling,
especially in the presence of film cooling. Different types of ash
(e.g. coal bituminous, lignite, etc.) have been used for performing
particle deposition on a gas turbine nozzle [12,26,152] . Such tests
allow  the  proper  analysis  of  the  flow  dynamic  behavior  in  the
particle  impact  and  adhesion  phenomena,  giving  the  possibility
to realize the same flow conditions of the actual application. By
contrast, the complexity of the flow structure and the effects of
geometric features that characterize an actual gas turbine nozzle
could  represent  an  obstacle  in  the  definition  of  general  rules
and trends related to particle sticking. In Fig. 8 , the comparison
between the deposits pattern without and with film cooling using
bituminous ash is reported. The effect of cooling holes on parti-
cles  deposition  pattern  is  still  under  investigation.  Experimental
tests [153] , also run with high gas temperature [154] , attempt to
improve the comprehension of particle deposition.

Other specific contributions can be found in relation to the ef-
fects of the electrostatic charge on particle deposition [155] and
[156] , the assessment of the thermophoresis force on the particle
deposition in the gas turbine engine secondary air system [157] ,
the investigation of sintering process of the deposits [158] , and the
influence of the deposit on the heat transfer and the influence of
the  free-stream  turbulence  on  the  particle  deposition  [159] .  The

EYJA 2 has different chemical compositions with respect to EYJA.
The chemical composition in terms of oxide weight fraction was derived starting from the element count% reported in [144] (Si 17.5%, Al 7.1%, Na 3.4%, Ca 3.2%, Mg 3.6%,

Ti 0.6%, K 0.2% and Fe 3.4%).

volcanic and coal particles, respectively. Each material is indicated
with the same name used in the respective reference. In the case
of more than one contribution that uses the same material, with
different test conditions, a progressive number is adopted. For each
test (grouped according to the reference), the particle characteris-
tics such as dimension and density are reported. The particle di-
mension indicates the variability range or the mean mass diame-
ter used in each test (if provided). Unfortunately, detailed data on
other interesting parameters such as d
75 , which represents
the diameters for which the 50% and 75% of the particles measured
are less than the stated size, are not reported.

50 and d

The  test  conditions  are  also  indicated  and,  in  absence  of  de-
tailed  information,  particle  velocity  is  assumed  equal  to  the  gas
velocity  and  particle  temperature  is  assumed  equal  to  the  gas
temperature. Fixed value or the indicated variability range is also
specified. Regarding the velocity, in the case of test realized on a
full-scale gas turbine, a representative particle impact velocity of

100 m/s is chosen because no-data related to this variable is re-
ported [141,142] .

Finally, Tables 4–6 report also the type of target (TT), used in

the experimental tests, with a reference of:

• T, the test is realized on a full-scale gas turbine;
• B, the test is realized on wind tunnel provided with cascade or

single blade target;

• C, the test is realized using a coupon;
• I,  the  test  is  realized  in  order  to  discover  particle  deposition

inside the internal cooling hole.

All of this information (dimension, density, velocity, and tem-
perature)  provide  the  first  overview  of  the  experimental  con-
tribution  related  to  particle  deposition  and  fouling  on  gas  tur-
bine hot sections. Particle velocities span from 15 m/s to 350 m/s
while the temperature values range from 850 K to 1900 K, approx-
imately. Wind tunnel tests allow the best control in terms of test

calculated according to CoolProp library [165] .

Starting  from  this  detailed  information,  the  particle  Stokes
number and the particle relaxation time can be calculated. In Ap-
pendix B data about the geometrical features of the target for each
experimental test are reported. Particle Stokes number and particle
relaxation time are listed in relation to the airflow characteristics

4.2. Experimental uncertainties

The  uncertainty  related  to  the  experimental  test  condi-
tions  and  at  in  turn,  the  accuracy  of  the  particle  deposition

results,  are  not  always  reported  in  literature  even  if  a  con-
siderable  number  of  tests  indicate  the  experimental  uncertainty
[12,26,56,108,111,112,115,116,118–120,122,148,152,153,159] . The diffi-
culties are especially related to the not-clear correlation between
the uncertainties related to test conditions like flow velocity and
temperature and mass deposits or sticking coefficients. Measure-
ment uncertainties have to be considered different from the vari-
ability of the test conditions even if, both of them determine the
amount of deposits. The present data collection allows the defini-
tion of a sort of tolerance band of the experimental data reported
in the present review.

Given the sticking model relations which are based on the par-
ticle characteristics strongly related to the temperature, one of the
most important uncertainties related to the experimental results
is that which characterizes the temperature measurements. Uncer-
tainties related to the temperature values are estimated equal to
0.11% [148] , 1.3% [116] and 2% [12,26,152,159] . These values have
to  be  correlated  with  the  actual  temperature  in  order  to  high-
light  the  influence  of  the  measurement  uncertainty  on  the  par-
ticle  characteristic and thus,  on  their sticking capability. Accord-
ing  to  the  aforementioned  percentage  values,  the  uncertainty  in
terms  of  Kelvin  become  equal  to  1 K  [148] ,  19 K  [116] ,  and  27 K
[12,26,152,159] .  Given  the  high  temperature  at  which  the  tests
were carried out (up to 1500 K), these uncertainty values appear
in line with those reported in literature even if, according to the
analysis  reported  in  the  following  paragraphs,  a  slight  deviation
could be determined between the sticking prediction provided by
the models and the actual results of the experimental tests.

In  the  same  way  of  the  temperature  measurement,  even  the
uncertainties  related  to  the  mass  flow  rate  are  useful  to  im-
prove the comprehension of the experimental results. In particu-
lar, these uncertainty values could be used to estimate the uncer-
tainty in the particle impact velocity. For the collected data, these
uncertainty  are  estimated  to  be  equal  to  about  0.80%  [148]  and
4%  [12,26,115,159] .  According  to  the  percentage  values,  the  un-
certainty  of  the  mass  flow  rates  in  [148]  is  equal  to  0.0074 g/s,
while in [12,26,115,159] , the maximum uncertainty value is equal
to 0.015 kg/s.

Regarding the uncertainty of the particle concentration used to
contaminate the main air flow, data are not commonly reported.
Only in [108,115] , the accuracy in the particle contamination is re-
ported and is equal to 6 ppmw (parts per million weight). Other
uncertainties are related to the geometry and position of the target
[120,122] , in the capture efficiency evaluation [118,119] and mass
measurements  [116] .  Proper  methods  for  uncertainty  estimation
are adopted in [148] by applying [12,152,166] using the procedure
reported in [167] . In other cases, the uncertainties were estimated
by duplicating the tests as reported in [112,119] .

In relation with the variability of the tests condition during the
deposition tests, the variability of the flow temperature is between
3 K [159] (for a tested flow temperature of 1353 K), 6 K [12] (for
a  tested  flow  temperature  in  the  range  of  1314 K  – 1385 K)  and
5 K  in  [153]  (for  a  tested  flow  temperature  of  866 K).  Regarding
the variability of the mass flow rate, in [159] is declared equal to
0.005 kg/s (that corresponds to the 2.8% and 1.4% for a tested mass
flow rate values of 0.181 kg/s and 0.363 kg/s, respectively) while in
[12] is declared equal to 0.01 kg/s (that corresponds to the 1.8% and
2.7% for a tested mass flow rate values of 0.557 kg/s and 0.365 kg/s,
respectively).  Other  inaccuracies  are  especially  related  to  the  ef-
fects of radiation on the flow temperature measures [56,111,116] .

Data collection covers about thirty (30) years of particle deposi-
tion tests, realized using several different facilities and instrumen-
tations.  The  amount  of  data,  their  variability,  and  their  different
nature  give  the  possibility  to  discover  the  widest  view  of  parti-
cle deposition on the gas turbine hot section. The present analy-
sis is based on the data available in open literature, and the data

post-process reported in the following paragraph allows the com-
prehension of the basic phenomena using per-order-of-magnitude
variations.

4.3. Chemical composition

The particle behavior depends on the relationship between par-
ticle viscosity and temperature and this is strongly dependent on
the chemical composition. Tables 4–6 report the chemical compo-
sition as a weight fraction of sodium oxide Na
2 O, potassium ox-
2 O, calcium oxide CaO, magnesium oxide MgO, silicon dioxide
ide K
SiO
2, and iron oxide
3 .  Obviously, these oxides do not cover the entire composi-
Fe
tion for each material but these components characterize each ash,
powder, and particle determining their physical characteristics.

2 , aluminum oxide Al
2 O

3 , titanium dioxide TiO

2 O

This  wide  compositional  range  is  related  to  the  process  for-
mation of the ash or powder and might include particles formed
from new materials as well as those derived by the fragmentation
of  pre-existing  components  which  are  subjected  to  degradation
or combustion processes. In this context, Srinivasachar et al. [29]
have carried out combustion and deposition experiments with coal
(San Miguel Texas lignite) to assess critical viscosity hypothesis for
deposition processes. These experiments have highlighted that fi-
nal ash composition is independent of combustion conditions and
the analysis of individual combustion ash particle have shown that
there are negligible interactions between the particles which are
characterized by similar final chemical composition. In light of the
above, bulk composition can thus provide an overall indication of
each particle behavior and its relation between viscosity, tempera-
ture, and chemical composition. However, a certain degree of non-
uniformity  could  be  represented  by  the  initial  formation  of  liq-
uid phase due to the low temperature eutectic during the parti-
cle heating, such as the combination between sodium oxide with
silica and aluminum dioxides, that generates a liquid fraction start-
ing from 1200 K. Similar findings are reported in [169] , where the
presence of sodium sulfate generates a condensed phase that in-
creases the particle sticking capability. This sort of inhomogeneity
represents the first phase of particle softening process, that rep-
resents one of the most important parameters for estimating the
particle adhesion capability. A graphical description of this occur-
rence  can  be  realized  by  means  of  the  ternary  plot.  Fig.  9  de-
picts two different ternary plots according to the triplets Al
3 -
SiO
3 with the indication of the liquidus
curves [170] together with the correspondent temperature value.
The liquidus temperature can be compared with the temperature
value at which the deposition test is carried out. The deposition
tests  are  reported  by  means  of  different  markers  based  on  the
chemical  composition  reported  in  Tables  4–6 .  A  higher  content
of silica dioxide corresponds to higher liquidus temperature, and
in turn, the deposition test is carried out when particles are not
melted yet. Another element of information that can be drawn, is
related to the effects of each oxide on the particle behavior. For
example,  for  the  majority  of  the  considered  tests  reported  in
Tables  4–6 ,  the  presence  of  iron  dioxide  does  not  influence  the
liquidus temperature that can be assumed equal to 1673 K due to
the higher presence of silica dioxide. In addition, it can be high-
lighted that the ash composition of several tested coals occurs in
mullite phase field. Mullite is the predominant phase of coal ash
that is formed due to kaolinite and other clays decomposition dur-
ing combustion [171] .

With this qualitative data representation (due to the approxi-
mation of this data post-process based on only three oxides) it is
clear how the correlation between particle composition and tem-
perature could determine different phenomena during the impact
process.  The  different  amount  of  oxide  content  in  each  test  in-
crease the complexity of the result comparison process and thus,

each test condition has to be considered as fundamental informa-
tion coupled with the particle chemical composition.

The final consideration is related to the literature data. The ma-
terial  characterization  is  often  reported  but  sometimes  it  is  not
complete or, in the worst cases, completely absent. Material char-
acterization is fundamental for calculating physical properties such
as viscosity and surface tension which are the most important pa-
rameter in the particle adhesion phenomenon. For this reason, in
this work, two characterizations related to the volcanic rock, are
taken from literature. In details, the composition of Twin Mountain
basaltic rock [172] and St. Helens rock [173] are taken from litera-
ture. For completeness, in Appendix C , the compositions in term of
molar fraction values are also reported.

4.4. Particle size, temperature and mineral/glass ratio

With the reference of the data reported in Tables 4–6 , it is clear
how each test is characterized by several peculiarities, as well as
different  particle  size  and  temperature.  This  evidence  introduces
some critical aspect into the determination of a proper framework
under which a useful comparison can be carried out.

According  to  the  contamination  source,  three  families  can  be
recognized such as silty, coal and volcanic particles even if, only
the  volcanic  ash  particles,  are  created  by  instantaneous  and,  in
many cases, explosive processes. For these reasons, in the litera-
ture, detailed analyses are reported in relation to their dimension
and material structure. Volcanic ashes are characterized by differ-

ent fractions of crystals and amorphous solids (juvenile fragments)
created during explosive volcanism phenomena. Specific volcanic
events  (phreatomagmatic  eruptions,  pyroclastic  density  currents,
and  explosive  eruptions)  determine  variations  in  terms  of  crys-
tals/volcanic  glasses  fractions  and  changes  in  chemical  composi-
tions. The intrinsic structural nature of the ash, comprised of fine
fragments of magmatic glasses, magmatic crystals, and other lithic
materials, influences the temperature-dependent material charac-
teristics causing, for example, significant modification in sintering
and/or melting conditions of ash particles. This wide variability in
chemical and physical ash characteristics makes it difficult to eval-
uate the behavior of volcanic ash and the proper characterization
of the material structure is often tedious due to the structurally
complex  nature  of  ash  components.  Regarding  the  coal-like  par-
ticles, a description of the generation of ash particles is reported
in [169] . Large particles are formed by the mechanism of coales-
cence, while fine particles are the result of vaporization and the
subsequent condensation of volatile inorganic elements. This im-
plies that a certain degree of inhomogeneity in terms of size and
composition  can  be  found  after  the  combustor,  but,  no  detailed
analyses are available in this sense, especially related to the com-
bustion process in a gas turbine.

A lack of contaminant characterization in terms of temperature-
dependent  material  characteristics  implies  hypotheses  and  un-
avoidable inaccuracies that should be the main reason for push-
ing new strategies and tests procedures forward. For example, in
volcanic  ash  analysis,  the  relation  between  ash  composition  and

119

melting temperature (and in turn, ash viscosity) is very difficult to
predict in detail [143] . Other contributions [83,85,174] , show the
influence of the heating rate on the evolution of the wettability
and spreading of volcanic ash. More specifically, the wetting effi-
ciency of volcanic ash is dependent on particle size and particle
temperature together with mineral/glass ratio [95,145] . As reported
by Taltavull et al. [143] , these factors are related to the adhesion
rate for normal surface incidence.

Regarding  the  dimension,  as  mentioned  before,  non-precise
data are reported but, some general consideration can be drawn. It
is clear that the adhesion rate is more influenced by a larger parti-
cle because its weight is comparable to that of several smaller par-
ticles (e.g. one 50 μm particle weighs the same as a thousand 5 μm
particles). Particle size also affects the rate at which the particle
temperature  achieves  the  substrate  temperature:  fragments  with
smaller diameters are capable of reaching more quickly the sub-
strate temperature compared to larger particles and this is at the
base of the theoretical effect of heat transfer to different particle
sizes [95,96] . In this context, the mineral/glass content of the ash
can play a key role in the deposition rate. When glass transition
temperature is reached, most of the amorphous (glassy) particles
are expected to rapidly become very soft promoting the particle
adhesion phenomenon. Finally, the mechanical properties are re-
lated also to the particle diameter. As reported in [175] , the particle
Young’s modulus may increase when particles are smaller. In par-
ticular, in [175] an exponential dependence of the particle Young’s
modulus on the grain size is reported because, when the particle
is small, the material structure is less affected by inhomogeneity
and defects.

All of these effects affect the experimental results carried out
over the years and, in turn, influence the present data post-process.
By contrast, given the number of tests which involve several mate-
rials, particle sizes and test conditions, can be concluded that the
present data post-process can be considered robust against these
effects within a certain tolerance band, allowing the comprehen-
sion of the particle deposition phenomenon based on per order of
magnitude considerations.

5. Particle sticking models and viscosity methods: mutual
interaction and critical analysis

The previous analysis has shown that the deposition tests listed
in Tables 4–6 are carried out with temperature values lower than
liquidus  temperature  and,  thus,  they  are  characterized  by  semi-
molten  particles  which  impact  on  a  solid  surface.  For  this  rea-
son, the measurement of the particles viscosity is not straightfor-
ward and, it implies several difficulties. Fig. 10 shows the isovis-
cosity contour plot based on the ternary plots of the triplet Al
3 -
2 –CaO and gives the possibility to compare the collected data
SiO
with  the  viscosity  values  measured  at  1773 K  [170] .  The  regions
not  covered  by  the  isoviscosity  lines  are  due  to  the  lack  of  lit-
erature data and, in some instances the presence of solid matter
(higher content of silica dioxide). Despite the fact that this qualita-
tive representation is not useful for carrying out the analysis of the
deposition process (the temperature value is constant and higher
than the experimental particle temperature), it gives the opportu-
nity to highlight how the particle chemical composition influences
the particle impact behavior. By a slight modification of mass frac-
tion oxide content, the particle viscosity changes by an order of
magnitude for the same temperature value.

5.1. Particle viscosity: quantification and model application

Based on the chemical composition of the material, in this sec-
tion, the particle viscosity is calculated as a function of the tem-
perature. Using the listed models (NPL [69] , S 2 [70] , WF [71] , S&T

[72] , RRLG [73] , SDS [74] and GRD [75] ) it is possible to calculate
the viscosity values as a function of the material composition and
temperature.  This  allows  the  comparison  between  different  tests
(carried out with different materials and temperature) in terms of
viscosity. The viscosity values are calculated for all materials re-
ported in Tables 4–6 following the models reported.

As  mentioned,  based  upon  the  viscosity  model  analysis  (re-
ported in details in Appendix A ) the NPL model works with all the
considered  materials  due  to  the  absence  of  specific  applicability
limits (in terms of chemical composition) allowing for the compar-
ison among the deposition tests without restrictions. Due to this,
for the cross-comparison between the viscosity model reported in
the following paragraph, the NPL model represents a sort of refer-
ence giving the chance to compare several models (applied accord-
ing to their applicability limits) with respect to the same reference
values. For each analysis, all the viscosity models which are suit-
able (in terms of particle composition) for the analysis are used,
in  order  to  improve  the  completeness  of  the  present  data  post-
process.

Based on viscosity calculation and by applying the critical vis-
cosity method, it is possible to define the capability of each parti-
cle to adhere to the surface, by comparing the instantaneous par-
ticle viscosity and the critical viscosity value. The critical viscosity
values could be calculated using one of the reported viscosity mod-
els, where the particle temperature corresponds to the softening
temperature T
soft . According to Eqs. (19) –(23) , the particle soften-
ing temperature is calculated according to the materials composi-
tions. Even if in some instances the particle softening temperature
is reported, in order to compare all tests under the same condi-
tions, the particle softening temperature is calculated for all tests.
Table 7 shows the softening temperature for all materials listed in
Tables 4–6 .

Therefore,  starting  from  the  particle  characteristics,  it  is  now
possible to compare the viscosity ratio ( μ/ μc ) trends at the critical
condition related to the sticking model. Fig. 11 reports the variation
of the particle viscosity ratio ( μ/ μc ) as a function of the tempera-
ture, according to the NPL model, while Fig. 12 reports the viscos-
ity prediction according to the different models (S 2 [70] , WF [71] ,
S&T [72] , RRLG [73] , SDS [74] and GRD [75] ). Each model is ap-
plied within its validity limits. According to the critical viscosity
method, two regions for each material can be defined according to
the viscosity ratio ( μ/ μc ) identifying the sticky and rebound con-
ditions. As can be seen in Fig. 11 , experimental tests are mainly
conducted in the sticky regions excluding a few cases in which the
results of test conditions lie inside the rebound region due to the
lower particle temperature of deposition tests. State the analysis
of Figs. 11 and 12 , it is clearly visible the immense variability in
the viscosity obtained for the same substance from different mod-
els and also that, using such widely different values will result in
contrasting predictions if different sticking models are applied. For
the sake of completeness, the viscosity values as a function of the
particle temperature are reported in Appendix D , with the use of
similar plots of Figs. 11 and 12 . Appendix D reports several data
related to the material type and contaminant sources used for the
materials listed in Tables 4–6 and, in addition, the critical viscosity
value is shown for each test as a function of the viscosity model.

In details, the following analysis reports a distinction between
the tests according to the viscosity method. At the same time, the
softening temperature is calculated with the same aforementioned
model proposed by Yin et al. [88] . The first analysis, reported in
Figs. 13 and 14 , shows silty and coal particle tests respectively. The
marker shape indicates the test while the color indicates the vis-
cosity method. In this case, silty particle tests mainly belong to the
rebound region, while coal particle tests are located in the sticky
region even if, some of these tests are conducted with the same
temperature as silty tests. This difference is due to the different

relationship between particle viscosity and temperature generated
by the different chemical compositions. As reported by Kueppers
et al. [84] , differences in chemical composition must be taken into
account and the similarities between different particle impact tests
have to be drawn considering these differences. Therefore, the use
of ARD particles instead of coal particles for carrying out exper-
imental  tests  in  laboratory  test  facilities  could  generate  several
mismatches with respect to the actual applications. Figs. 13 and
14 show, in addition, the different viscosity ratio ( μ/ μc ) predictions
provided  by  the  viscosity  methods.  The  variations  between  the
NPL model and the GRD and S&T models increase towards lower
temperature. In addition, the NPL predictions appear more close
to the critical value ( μ/ μc = 1) than other models. Considering the
comparison reported  in  Fig.  15 ,  it  can  be  noted  that  predictions
are  not  aligned  with  the  straight  dashed  line  (provided  as  a
reference for the reader), but the trends change according to the

tests  and  according  to  the  viscosity  ratio  μ/ μc .  For  high  values
of viscosity ratio, NPL and GRD model predictions (see Fig. 15 a)
are very different (several orders of magnitude), while, across the
critical point (see Fig. 15 a and b), the predictions appear similar
even if characterized by different slopes. A detailed description of
the  relations  between  the  viscosity  method,  sticking  model  and
particle characteristics will report in the following sections.

Given that there have been a considerable number of tests of
volcanic  ash  deposition,  a  dedicated  analysis  is  carried  out.  The
viscosity  method  proposed  by  Giordano  et  al.  [75]  is  expressly
based on several volcanic ash samples (see Appendix A for com-
pleteness) and, in this section, it will be compared with the more
general method proposed by Mills and Sridhar [69] .

According  to  the  chemical  classification  proposed  in  [176] ,
Fig. 16 reports the Total Alkali-Silica (TAS) diagram with the super-
imposition of the fourteen (14) volcanic ashes considered in this

review. The TAS classification can be used to categorized volcanic
rocks based upon the relationships between the alkali and the sil-
ica contents. This distinction, that represents the relative propor-
tions  of  alkalis  and  silica  which  are  fundamental  for  an  easier
determination of the volcanic mineralogy based on the chemical
composition. This classification was firstly reported in [176] with
the endorsement of the International Union of Geological Sciences
(Subcommission of the Systematics of Igneous Rocks).

Tests can be classified according to six (6) different categories
called  basalt,  basaltic-andesite,  dacite,  rhyolite,  basaltic  trachy-
andesite, and trachydacite. These subalkaline series are character-
ized by a lower amount of alkali and a progressive increase in silica
dioxide content and are included in the GRD model limits.

Fig. 17 reports the viscosity ratio as a function of the tempera-
ture for volcanic ashes using the GRD and NPL models. Thirteen
(13)  tests  out  of  seventeen  (18)  are  shown.  Laki  2,  3,  4  and  5
and Twin Mountain tests are characterized by a particle compo-
sition out of the validity range indicated by Giordano et al. [75] .
In a different way of coal particles, about half of these tests be-
long to the sticky region. As mentioned above, by using different
viscosity prediction models, the viscosity ratio ( μ/ μc ) can vary no-
ticeably, but the mutual variation between NPL and GRD methods
appears very similar to those reported for silty and coal particles

(see Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 ). This means that even if the GRD model is
based only on volcanic ash materials (by means of a data regres-
sion,  as  reported  in  Appendix  A ),  it  performs  similar  prediction,
in comparison with the NPL model, even for the material derived
from different sources (silty and coal particles).

Fig.  18  shows  the  comparison  between  the  critical  viscos-
ity  ratio  calculated  according  to  the  NPL  and  the  GRD  viscos-
ity models. Sticking and rebound regions are superimposed onto
the  graph  dividing  the  two  regions  as  a  function  of  the  viscos-
ity model. The comparison highlights how the choice of the vis-
cosity  model  affects  the  particle  adhesion  prediction.  It  can  be
noted  that  predictions  are  not  aligned  with  the  straight  dashed
line (provided as a reference for the reader), but the trends change
according  to  the  tests  and  according  to  the  viscosity  ratio  μ/ μc .
This  evidence  has  to  be  matched  with  the  trends  reported  in
Fig. 17: by changing the test temperature by 50 K, the particle vis-
cosity  may  change  by  an  order  of  magnitude  and,  by  consider-
ing the different relation between viscosity and temperature, this
could imply different predictions in terms of a particle sticking or
rebound.

This  analysis  shows  how  important  the  correct  estimation  of
particle temperature is, as well as the choice of the viscosity and
sticking models in the prediction of particle adhesion.

5.2. Particle velocity: application of the critical velocity method

In line with the viscosity analysis, it is possible to apply the
critical  velocity  method  defining  the  rebound/adhesion  regions.
This  analysis  is  carried  out  using  Eq.  (16)  for  the  calculation  of
the Young modulus and using Eq. (15) as a reference. This rela-
tion is used in literature for both ash contaminants [36] and JBPS
B 2 particles [23] . The Young modulus of the surface is set equal to
200 GPa, while the Poisson coefficient is equal to 0.3 for both par-
ticle and surface. The Young modulus for the particle is calculated
according to Eq. (14) that is suitable for coal-ash contamination.
Fig. 19 shows the comparison between a representative test (JBPS B
2) condition at v = 79 m/s and the consequent critical velocity. The

dashed line in the picture is representative of the particle velocity
used in the tests and the critical velocity is reported as a func-
tion of temperature and diameter. In this case, the overall range of
particle diameter (2 – 20) μm, instead of the mass mean average
diameter equal to 11.6 μm has been considered. In the same way,
temperature values in the range of (1273–1373) K instead of single
temperature value equal to 1366 K have been considered for the
analysis. This assumption is based on the experimental evaluations
reported in [151] . The Authors in [151] reported the temperature
map across the vane, showing a non-uniform temperature pattern.
If the particle velocity is lower than the critical velocity value, the
particle is able to stick to a surface.

Taking into consideration the critical velocity trends, for a given
particle diameter, the particle velocity ranges for which the par-
ticle  is  able  to  stick  increases  according  to  temperature  values.
This trend is related to Young modulus variation with temperature
(see Eq. (14) ). Analogous results can be obtained by fixing particle

temperature and decreasing particle diameter. In this case, the crit-
ical velocity value is inversely proportional to the particle diameter
(see Eq. (15) ).

As can be predicted by the critical velocity model, particle ad-
hesion occurs in the case of smaller diameter and higher temper-
ature values. In this case, according to the critical velocity model,
several experimental conditions lie outside the adhesion region. In
this case, the actual non-uniform temperature pattern, instead of
the single value taken as the reference for this test, shows how for
a single adhesion test, different predictions may occur as a func-
tion of the local flow conditions.

Critical  velocity  model  takes  into  account  particle  diameter
while  the  classic  formulation  of  the  critical  viscosity  model  ac-
counts  only  for  the  particle temperature  and  its  composition.  In
literature,  several  analyses  show  that  increasing  particle  diame-
ter  the  average  sticking  coefficient  decreases,  probably  due  to  a
not-complete particle heating during the experimental tests [150] .
Analytical  observations  have  highlighted  the  influence  of  surface
temperature [34] . In particular, in presence of blade cooling, the
sticking coefficient decreases due to the increment of the Young
modulus (molten particle starts to solidify).

5.3. Energy-based model: particle spread factor and overall
comparison

The  last  analysis  related  to  particle  adhesion/rebound  using
literature  sticking  model  refers  to  the  energy-based  model.  This
model is based on the estimation of particle deformation during
the impact and its correspondent energy balance between the dis-
sipative and conservative forces. The peculiarity of this approach is
related to the estimation of particle deformation as a consequence
of the impact. Beyond the target characteristics (such as elastic-
ity, hardness, surface roughness, etc.), one of the major challenges
is represented by the identification of the particle condition (such
as  solid  particle,  liquid  particle  or  semi-molten  particle)  upon
impact. As reported in the literature [177] the deformation process
is strongly dependent to the particle/droplet viscosity and surface
tension.

5.3.1. Particle surface tension

Fig. 20 reports the variation of the particle surface tension as a
function of the temperature according to the material reported in
Tables 4–6 . Therefore, each trend includes the particle surface ten-
sion variation due to the composition and temperature, while, each

dot  provides  the  particle  surface  tension  value  fixing  both  tem-
perature and composition when that material is tested at a fixed
temperature. The particle surface tension values are estimated in
agreement  with  Eq.  (24)  and  the  model  coefficient  collected  in
Table 2 . In the same fashion as seen for viscosity, particle surface
tension values decrease according to the temperature even if, the
variation over the temperature range is lower. The majority of data
are comprised within 0.35 N/m to 0.45 N/m.

5.3.2. Particle spread factor analysis

Several  types  of  research  are  devoted  to  model  the  parti-
cle/droplet deformation process by means of the non-linear rela-
tionship  between  non-dimensional  numbers  such  as  We  and  Re
and  the  contact  angle  realized  on  the  target.  As  demonstrated
by Kleinhans et al. [43] relationship derived from droplet impact
[50] could be used for representing semi-molten particle impact,
successfully.  In  particular,  in  [43] ,  the  sticking  behavior  of  soda
lime glass particles are well represented using the non-linear equa-
tion reported in [50] obtained for water mixture with a viscosity
value in the range (1–100) mPa s. Starting from this result, in this
section,  a  collection  of  the  relationships  able  to  model  the  par-
ticle deformation process are reported. In order to give an over-
all overview how these models tackle the problem of semi-molten
particle impact, six (6) relationships are used to calculate the par-
ticle  spread  factor  for  three  (3)  representative  tests  taken  from
Tables 4–6 , named ARD 2 (sandy particle), Eldgja (volcanic parti-
cle) and Coal (bituminous) 4 (coal particle) are considered.

Spread correlations available in the literature refer to the dif-
ferent  type  of  fluid/semi-molten  substances  and,  as  reported  in
[177]  are  characterized  by  some  limitations.  Most  of  these  are
related  to  the  difficulties  of  scaling  the  complex  interactions  of
liquid  properties,  surface  wettability,  dynamic  contact  angle  and
liquid velocity implying several difficulties to extend the validity
beyond the fluid tested. Unfortunately, all the models available in
the literature are based on studies of droplet impact having vis-
cosity  values  lower  than  that  involved  in  the  present  study.  For
example, very low viscosity fluid (3.9e-5 Pa s) was used by Jones
[46]  taken  inspiration  from  the  Madejski’s  model  [178]  charac-
terized by higher viscosity value (about 1 Pa s). Other models as
Pasandideh-Fard et al. [47] and Ukiwe and Kwok [48] are based
on experimental results obtained with droplet water. Similar fluid
viscosity  (n-heptane)  is  adopted  also  by  Chandra  and  Avedisian
[49]  while,  fluids  with  higher  viscosity  values,  are  used  by  Mao
et  al.  [50]  (fluid  viscosity  equal  to  100  mPa  s)  and  Sheller  and

Bousfield [51] (fluid viscosity equal to 300 mPa s). Table 8 shows
the non-linear equations used for calculating particle spread factor
for the three (3) considered experimental tests. As reported, each
equation depends on non-dimensional numbers (particle Reynolds
and/or Weber numbers) and, in some cases, on the contact angle
θ assumed equal to π /2 in the present study.

According to the relations reported in Table 8 , Figs. 21 and 22
show  the  spread  factor  trend  as  a  function  of  particle  diameter
and particle viscosity, respectively. In order to simplify the anal-
ysis,  particle  viscosity  is  calculated  according  to  the  NPL  model,
only.  Each  figure  reports  the  results  obtained  for  the  three  con-
sidered tests (ARD 2, Eldgja and Coal (bituminous) 4). Taken into
consideration  Fig.  21 ,  trends  appear  very  similar  for  particle  di-
ameter  higher  than  20 μm,  even  if,  the  spread  factor  values  are
widespread. In the case of smaller diameter, the trend provided by
Jones [46] deviates significantly with respect to the other. There-
fore,  in  the  case  of  small  particle  diameter,  data  dispersion  is
greater and the prediction of particle spread factor become more
affected by the selection of the spread factor model.

Similar  evidence  can  be  found  by  considering  the  sensitivity
analysis  reported  in  Fig.  22 .  In  this  case,  spread  factor  values
are  shown  as  a  function  of  the  particle  viscosity  values,  and,  it
is  visible that  for  lower particle viscosity,  the model  predictions

of particle spread factor values are very close to each other (see
Fig.  22 c,  for  example).  Moving  towards  higher  viscosity  values,
the  data  appear  very  dispersed  highlighting  the  variation  of  the
slope  among  the  models  (see  Fig.  22 a).  The  trends  ξ /μ appear
very different from each other and it is in the opposite way than
that reported in Fig. 21 , where, the ξ / d trends show very similar
slopes. This result derives from the relationship between particle
spread factor and the non-dimensional numbers Re and We (see
Table 8 ). Particle viscosity contributes only to the particle Reynolds
number while particle diameter contributes in both characteristic
numbers (Re and We). This implies that, from a particle deforma-
tion estimation point of view, the variation of particle viscosity in
more detrimental than particle diameter. Taking into consideration
the analyses reported in Figs. 21 and 22 , trends can be identified
and correlated with the droplet characteristics used for obtaining
model  equations  ( Eqs.  (27) –(32) ),  reported  in  Table  8 ).  Models
based  on  liquid  droplet  characterized  by  lower  viscosity  (Jones
[46] , Pasandidhed-Far et al. [47] and Ukiwe and Kwok [48] ) predict
lower particle spread factor values than the other models, which
are obtained with higher droplet viscosity.

The  energy-based  models  are  built  on  the  definition  of  a
particle spread factor threshold value ( ξ = 0.4 for the present work,
see  Fig.  4  for  the  full  explanation),  and  with  the  reference  of

particle sticking phenomenon, different spread factor models give
a different prediction of particle deformation for the same particle
in  the  same  impact  conditions.  According  to  the  energy-based
model, for a particle spread factor ξ equal or less than 0.4, particle
sticks to the surface, otherwise, it bounces. On the basis of these
analyses, the model prediction of particle spread factor plays a key
role when particle sticking prediction is based on the estimation
of  the  energy  dissipation  provided  by  the  particle  deformation
during the impact. Therefore, with this approach, particle sticking
prediction  is  affected  by  (i)  the  model  assumptions  related  to
the spread factor equation and, taking into consideration also the
estimation of particle viscosity and surface tension, (ii) the models
used for estimating the particle characteristics upon the impact.

In the following sections, the model of Mao et al. [50] is taken
as a reference for analyzing the literature results, comparing the
spread factor values with a threshold value ( ξ = 0.4). As reported
by Kleinhans et al. [43] , Mao et al.’s [50] model is able to well-
recognized particle sticking in the case of high viscous substance
(e.g. soda lime glass particle).

5.3.3. Spread factor values

Starting  from  the  particle  Reynolds  number  and  particle We-
ber number and using Eq. (31) it is possible to calculate the cor-
respondent spread factor for each deposition test. To perform this,
the particle surface tension has to be calculated according to the
Eq. (24) with the reference of Table 2 . Based on the derived parti-
cle surface tension values, Fig. 23 reports a three-dimensional vari-
ation of the spread factor as a function of We and Re for a repre-
sentative fixed value of contact angle [50] equal to 90 °. In Fig. 23 ,
red and black dots represent all the data reported in Tables 4–6 .
The threshold value of the spread factor ( ξ = 0.4) is marked with
a white line that divided the grey region from the pale-grey re-
gion. The grey region represents the sticking region ( ξ ≥ 0.4) in
which the red dots represent the energy-based model prediction
in agreement with the literature deposition tests, while the pale-
grey region represents the rebound region ( ξ < 0.4) in which the
black  dots  represents  the  energy-based  model  prediction  in  dis-
agreement with the literature deposition tests. Therefore, some de-
position tests belong to the rebound region instead of the sticky re-
gion. In this case, particle diameter, velocity, and temperature are
the  main  contributors  in  the  to  spread  factor  values.  The  three-
dimensional surface We-Re- ξ shows, in correspondence of lower
values of particle Weber number, a curvature variation due to the
roots of the cubic relation reported in Eq. (31) .

5.4. Comparison between critical viscosity and energy-based sticking
models

The comparison proposed in Fig. 24 is related to the critical vis-
cosity method and the energy-based model calculated according to
the NPL viscosity model. Trends are related to a fixed particle di-
ameter and particle temperature variation (if present) that implies
the contemporary variation of particle viscosity and spread factor
values. The trend lines report the variation of particle spread as
a function of the viscosity for a fixed particle diameter. In some
cases, experimental tests are conducted with a certain particle di-
ameter dispersion with a constant temperature value. In this case,
no trend-lines are depicted because no-relation between particle
spread and particle viscosity depend on the diameter.

The data summarized in Fig. 24 are subdivided according to two
lines: the vertical line divides rebound/adhesion regions according
to critical viscosity method while the horizontal line divides re-
bound/adhesion regions according to energy-based model.

From the comparison, it is clear the difference in the particle
sticking prediction related to these models. From the present sub-
division,  two  regions  could  be  clearly  detected  according  to  the
two models. The adhesion region is recognized using the simul-
taneous conditions of μ/ μc < 1 and ξ ≥0.4 for which both methods
predict adhesion as a result of the particle impact. The other re-
gion,  characterized  by  μ/ μc > 1and  ξ < 0.4,  is  the  region  of  parti-
cle rebound. For the other two combinations ( μ/ μc > 1; ξ ≥0.4 and
μ/ μc < 1; ξ < 0.4) the two models are in disagreement, showing op-
posite  predictions.  It  can  be  remarked  that  all  data  collected  in
Tables 4–6 refer to experimental tests showing particle adhesion.
The overall analysis of the ( μ/ μc ; ξ ) trends is reported in Fig. 25
where the viscosity ratio and the spread factor values are calcu-
lated  according  to  the  other  six  (6)  viscosity  models  considered
(S 2  [70] , WF [71] , S&T [72] , RRLG [73] , SDS [74] and GRD [75] ).
As highlighted, different viscosity models predict different results
(see for example the test called Arkwright and Arkwright 3 with
the reference of Table 6 ) that could differ from sticking to rebound
results (see the predictions of S 2 and WF).

Therefore, the analyses reported in Figs. 24 and 25 show the
effects of the viscosity model on the particle sticking probability
as a function of particle composition. For example, looking at the
ARD tests, three different compositions (ARD, 2, 3, 4 with respect
to ARD 5 and ARD 6 tests, for details see Table 4 ,) characterized
by a high value of silica dioxide comprises in the range of (72.8
– 85.0) wt% are available for the comparison. In addition, due to

the preparation processes (e.g. filtration), different particle diame-
ter ranges characterize the literature value. Several tests belong to
the rebound region for which both sticking models fail the predic-
tion. In particular, even if the ARD and ARD 6 tests are conducted
with the same particle temperature 1373 K and 1363 K respectively,
the viscosity ratio is one order of magnitude different. The ARD 6
particles are characterized by a higher silica dioxide content that
reflects in higher softening temperature (see Table 7 ).

This mismatch between the actual experimental results and the
model prediction can be explained with two reasons: (i) the stick-
ing  models  are  not  able  to  represent  all  of  the  ARD  deposition
tests and/or (ii) for a specific test, the deposits are generated by
a certain combination of particle diameter, temperature, and ve-
locity. Therefore, even if the particle impact tests give particle ad-
hesion, this results could be generated by a small portion of pow-
der (in term of diameter) or by specific flow conditions (in term of

temperature). In the next sections, a detailed analysis of their mu-
tual interaction is proposed according to material composition.

5.4.1. Influences of particle composition

In this section, several specific analyses are realized considering
volcanic ash and coal-like tests. Volcanic ashes are characterized by
a lower content of silica dioxide than ARD, allowing the application
of three viscosity models (NPL, S&T, and GRD) matching the ash
composition and the applicability limits.

Fig. 26 a reports a detailed analysis of Basalt and Andesite tests
according to NPL, S&T, SDS, and GRD viscosity models. The marker
shape  indicates  the  test  while  the  color  indicates  the  viscosity
method. According to the volcanic ash classification, basalt and an-
desite  are  characterized  by  a  different  content  of  silica  dioxide.
With this comparison, clearly visible is the effects of the viscosity
model on the sticking/rebound prediction. The NPL method gives
higher values of particle spread factor, but at the same time, pro-
vides a viscosity ratio ( μ/ μc ) prediction closer to the threshold μ/ μc
= 1. The SDS model provides the lowest values of particle spread
factor  determining  conflicting  predictions  in  the  case  of  energy-
based sticking model.

In Fig. 26 b, Laki tests are reported. The NPL model determines
closer viscosity ratio value to the threshold ( μ/ μc = 1) in the stick-
ing region but, the effect affects also the rebound region. Consid-
ering the data distribution according to the abscissa, the viscosity
ratio values provided by the NPL model are the most squeezed to
μ/ μc = 1. This behavior is related to the formulation of the viscosity-
temperature  relation.  Taking  into  consideration  the  formulas  re-
ported for each model (see Table A3 in Appendix A ), the viscosity
values are based on specific and not univocal data extrapolation.

Moving to the coal-like particle tests, Fig. 27 considers Coal (bi-
tuminous) and North Dakota tests. These materials are character-
ized by the different content of silica dioxide and calcium oxide:
2 and 9.5%wt
Coal (bituminous) particles have about 50%wt of SiO
of  CaO  while  North  Dakota  particles  have  about  20%wt  of  SiO
2
and  23%wt  of  CaO.  As  can  be  seen  from  the  graph,  similar  ef-
fects on the viscosity ratio and spread factor values are generated
by the viscosity models. The NPL formulation determines a viscos-
ity ratio ( μ/ μc ) prediction closer to the threshold μ/ μc  = 1 for the
same test condition. This effect is more visible in the case of North
2 and a higher
Dakota test characterized by a lower amount of SiO
amount of CaO. Given that the present analysis, for a particle ma-
terial similar to North Dakota, the SDS model appears more suit-
able for calculating particle adhesion according to the critical vis-
cosity method. Opposite results can be obtained with the reference
of the energy-based method. North Dakota tests appear closer to

viscosity  value  (M)  obtained  considering  the  magnitude  of  the
model’s  constants.  As  highlighted  by  the  trends,  each  model  is
characterized by a different slope and thus, different sensitivity to
the temperature. NPL and S 2  models are less sensitive to a tem-
perature  variation  while  other  models  (e.g.  WF  and  GRD)  show
a strong dependence to the temperature value. By increasing the
temperature value of two (2) times, the normalized viscosity val-
ues increase by thirty (30) orders of magnitude.

This  analysis  shows  the  implication  of  particle  temperature
estimation  or  measurement  as  well  as  the  interaction  between
viscosity and sticking models in the prediction of particle adhe-
sion and/or rebound. Summarizing the outcomes of the analysis,
Table 9 reports the model equations, the basis on that each model
is based and, in addition, the dependences of model coefficients
to  the  particle  chemical  composition.  This  information,  together
with the sensitivity analysis reported in this work, could be useful
for  the  proper  selection  of  the  viscosity  model.  Beyond  the  NPL
model, that is based on the optical basicity, the other methods are
based on a specific material, that could be used as a reference for
the proper application of the model. For example, the RRLG model
is more suitable for slags instead of GRD, that is more appropriate
for volcanic ashes. Other considerations can be done taking into
consideration the model equation. The strong correlation between
viscosity  and  temperature  is  different  among  the  models,  as
reported  in  Fig.  28 ,  and,  for  this  reason,  models  characterized
by  steeper  viscosity-to-temperature  trends  are  more  suitable  for
the  cases  in  which  the  particle  experience  higher  temperature
gradient (such as gas turbine nozzle equipped with cooling holes).
A  reported  in  Table  7 ,  each  model  has  a  different  tem perature-
viscosity relation. Quadratic dependency (see WF model) or linear
(see GRD model) show a greater variation of the viscosity for the
same temperature variation.

Regarding  the  particle  chemical  composition,  each  model  is
characterized by different model coefficients which depend on the
oxides contents. In Table 9 , a qualitative description of the influ-
ence of particle chemical composition on the viscosity-temperature
trends are reported for each viscosity model. Peculiarities can be
noticed for the RRLG method, that is not related to the silica diox-
ide content, but only to the calcium and magnesium oxides and

for the S 2 and WF where aluminum trioxide and magnesium oxide
are not considered, respectively.

With this first model overview, it is clear how the selection of
the proper viscosity model has to be related to the chemical com-
position of the particle and to the source of the given contaminant.
In Appendix A , all model equations and coefficients are reported
with the correspondent applicability limits and uncertainty.

In conclusion, if the sticking model is based on the energy dis-
sipation,  the  viscosity  model  prediction  is  fundamental  in  order
to estimate the proper energy dissipation. In this case, a viscosity
model that predicts lower viscosity values, for the same particle
characteristics, is suitable for predicting the particle adhesion with
a wider confidence band. Besides the dedicated experimental test
that represents the greatest method used to discern the actual re-
sult, it could be useful to find a new method, based on the present
evidence, able to represent the combined effects related to particle
deformation and its material characteristics.

6. Dimensional analysis

Given  the  literature  data  related  to  different  research  fields,
the analysis of non-dimensional numbers characterizing the physic
of  the  present  phenomenon  may  represent  valid  support  for
improving  the  comprehension  of  the  particle  impact  behavior.
Starting  from  the  particle  characteristics  involved  in  the  three
sticking  models  considered  in  the  present  review,  the  Bucking-
ham  Pi  Theorem  [179]  is  applied.  The  relationships  between
the  particle  sticking  capability  and  several  particle  characteris-
tics  by  means  of  non-dimensional  groups  are  reported  in  the
first  part  of  the  present  section.  From  the  results  and  the  lit-
erature  models  reported  above  (critical  viscosity,  critical  veloc-
ity,  and  energy-based  models),  six  (6)  independent  variables
are  identified.  The  set  of  independent  variables  is  reported  in
Table  10  where  they  are  express  in  terms  of  its  fundamental
dimensions.

As can be seen from Table 10 particle temperature is not in-
cluded in the set of independent variables. The effect of the tem-
perature on the particle sticking phenomenon is included in the
viscosity and Young modulus variation.

Therefore,  excluding  the  particle  Young  Modulus,  particle
Reynolds number and particle Weber number appear suitable for
representing the particle sticking behavior.

Thanks to the data related to particle dimension, density, vis-
cosity and surface tension it is possible to calculate the particle
Reynolds number and the particle Weber number, defined accord-
ing  to  Eqs.  (1),  (2)  supposing  that  the  particle  velocity  is  equal
to the gas velocity. Therefore, starting from the literature data re-
ported  in  Tables  4–6 ,  and  the  computation  of  the  viscosity  and
surface tension, Fig. 29 reports the logarithmic chart with the re-
lationship of particle Reynolds number and particle Weber num-
ber. As mentioned, the calculation is performed using the viscosity

values obtained with the NPL model. The overall analysis of the
We-Re trends is reported in Fig. 30 where the particle Reynolds
numbers are calculated according to the six (6) viscosity models
considered (S 2  [70] , WF [71] , S&T [72] , RRLG [73] , SDS [74] and
GRD [75] ). The regions related to the printable fluids [19] are also
reported.

The trends related to the mono-parametric variation of particle
diameter, velocity and temperature are traced. In several cases, the
experimental tests are carried out using a powder sample charac-
terized by specific size distribution. For this reason, the data are
aligned with the particle-diameter trend. The variation of the tem-
perature determines the variation of particles properties like vis-
cosity and surface tension. The test named ARD 5 is characterized
by the lowest temperature (see Table 4 ) and for this reason, the
particle Reynolds number assumes the lowest values. For the sake
of clarity, this test is not reported in Fig. 36 .

Following  the  conceptual  framework  reported  in  Fig.  2 ,  non-
dimensional numbers allow the generalization of the present data
and the comparison between the present results with those ob-
tained  in  other  fields  of  research.  Comparing  the  We-Re  regions
involved in the gas turbine particle adhesion with the We-Re re-
gions related to the analysis of printable fluids [19] , see Fig. 29 ,
some  similarities can be  noticed.  The interactions between indi-
vidual drops and the substrate as well as between adjacent drops
are important in defining the resolution and accuracy of the print-
ing  process.  The  accuracy  of  the  printing  process  is  limited  by
the issues related to the droplet spread and/or overlap processes
of  adjacent  drops.  In  particular,  no-data  related  to  gas  turbine
conditions belong to the region called Satellite droplets , in which
the primary drop is accompanied by a large number of satellite
droplets,  but  almost  all  data  belonging  to  the  region  called  Too
viscous .

According to the literature findings [19] , the majority of the gas
turbine  fouling  data  have  shown  little  tendency  to  create  satel-
lite droplets and splashing. This means that, for these experimen-
tal test conditions, particles are very viscous and their deformation
during the impact is too low to break themselves up. In this con-
dition and considering the chemical composition of a particle that
characterizes the fouling phenomenon, the adhesion could be pro-
moted by low-melting substances, which performed a sort of glue
action at the impact region [55,87,137] . Given this, particle sticking
models have to consider the different interaction between particle
and substrate according to the chemical composition of the parti-

and particle temperature, while We-Re regions related to the analysis of printable fluids [19] are superimposed.

fouling tests can be done. For the majority of the collected tests,
no  evidence  related  to  deposition  under  splashing  conditions  is
reported.  However,  it  is  possible  to  extrapolate  some  consider-
ations  looking  at  the  appearance  of  the  deposits.  In  a  general
way,  the  splashing  process  is  a  rebound  condition  characterized
by  a  particle  deformation  and  breakup  able  to  generate  several
smaller  particles.  Taking  into  consideration  the  tests  carried  out
in [143] for volcanic ash particles, the comparison between Laki 2
and Laki 4 tests shows the particle impact behavior very similar to
those characterizing the splashing phenomenon. Fig. 32 reports the
appearance of the deposited particle for the Laki 2 and Laki 4 tests
with their correspondent detailed view. These two tests are charac-
terized by the same particle diameter, but different impact velocity
and temperature values. Laki 4 test is carried out with higher tem-
perature and impact velocity values than Laki 2 test.

Laki 4 test is clearly characterized by a very high particle defor-
mation: the deposited layer appears thinner and the splat process
of  the  particle  higher  than  those  reported  in  the  case  of  Laki  2
test. With the reference of Fig. 29 , Laki 4 test belongs to the onset
splashing region while Laki 2 test belongs to the too viscous region
confirming the experimental findings. In addition to the shape of
the deposited layer, it is possible to note the presence of several
smaller particles that surround the bigger one in the case of Laki
4 test. Higher impact velocity (that leads with higher Weber num-
ber) and higher temperature (that means lower viscosity and then
higher Reynolds number) determine a more favorable condition for
particle splashing.

Finally, an interesting aspect is related to the limit of particle
Weber number. As reported by Derby [19] , for the condition We
< 4, the energy is insufficient to generate suitable droplet for the
printing  process.  This  means  that  the  sticking  process  does  not
take  place  and  in  fact,  considering  the We-Re  plane  reported  in

cle, especially when the impact conditions imply the modification
of the surface interaction.

A particular condition named onset splashing is also highlighted
and  for  which  qualitative  cross-validation  with  the  hot  section

Fig. 29 , only two test conditions, related to the smallest particle
diameter, of the tests named ARD 3 and ARD 5 belong to this re-
gion. According to the literature review reported in [4] , these tests
are carried out for studying the sticking phenomenon in cooling
holes, and they are characterized by the lowest temperature val-
ues. In the light of these test conditions, the sticking phenomena
detected by the Authors for these tests, are probably related to the
influence of external parameter, as for example, flow structures.

Similarities  with  the  printable  fluids  highlight  the  possibility
to use non-dimensional numbers to generalized particular exper-
imental tests (i.e. gas turbine particle deposition) findings possible
original explanations of such phenomena. In this analysis, specific
information obtained a priori about splashing phenomena, could
be useful for settings the best experimental test avoiding inaccu-
racy or misinterpretation of the results. With the reference of that
background, a more general approach is reported in the following,
in order to give a general post-process (not only based on print-
able fluids field of research) applied to the hot section fouling phe-
nomenon.

As mentioned, the We-Re relationship seems to be strongly cor-
related  in  the  particle  deposition  phenomena.  This  result  is  line
with  the  literature,  where  it  is  reported  how  the  contemporary
use  of  Weber  number  and  Reynolds  number  allows  the  model-
ing of both surface and viscous behaviors [15] . Starting from this
consideration, non-dimensional parameters allow the definition of
the type of regime involved in particle impact. It may happen that
molten or quasi-molten particle impacts the blade surface, deform-
ing itself according to Fig. 3 . Assuming a certain degree of similar-
ity, when a droplet (e.g. semi-molten or molten particle) impacts a
wall, it may result in three different conditions: rebound, breakup
or  adhesion.  According  to  the  approach  adopted  in  [15] ,  the  re-
bound  condition  is  promoted  by  the  elastic  forces,  the  breakup
condition is due to the break of the interconnection forces and fi-
nally, the adhesion condition is reached when the droplet deforms
itselff (spreading process), generating a sort of film on the surface
by a dissipative process due to its viscosity force. Thus, the com-
prehension  of  the  spreading  process  assumes  paramount  impor-
tance for particle sticking modeling [16] . In order to do this, parti-
cle Ohnesorge number (see Eq. (3) ) is used coupled with particle
Weber number in order to define the particle spreading process
[16] . Particle Weber number is related to the force that generates
particle spread: at higher We the force is due to particle velocity
and particle diameter while at lower We the force is due to surface
tension.

Particle Ohnesorge number is related to the force that opposes
particle spread: at higher Z the force is due to the viscosity, while
at lower Z the force is due to the inertia. Fig. 32 shows the chart
We-Z defined according to the literature [16] , in which the data
reported in Tables 4–6 , are superimposed (the viscosity values are
calculated  according  to  the  NPL  model).  Present  data  belong  to
the region characterized by highly viscous particle and with the
impact-driven  particle  spread.  Therefore,  the  particle  kinetic  en-
ergy works against the viscous force. In this case, capillary force,
and then, surface tension, does not influence the particle spread
[16] . At the same time, the region called Impact driven puts the
attention on phenomena such as satellite droplets and splashing
which may influence the particle impact process in a gas turbine.
In this case, the first particle impact generates negligible deposits
but generates several smaller semi-molten particles with greater
capability to stick due to their low energy content. Analogous re-
sults can be obtained using the six (6) viscosity models considered
(S 2 [70] , WF [71] , S&T [72] , RRLG [73] , SDS [74] and GRD [75] ) re-
ported in Fig. 33 .

This analysis allows the comparison between the particles be-
havior  involved  in  gas  turbine  fouling  and  other  research  fields.
The non-dimensional analysis confirms the importance of particle
viscosity,  but  at  the  same  time,  highlights  the  relationship  with
particle velocity and diameter. Viscous force act related to parti-
cle temperature but the particle spread is driven also by particle
kinetic energy.

7. Generalization of the particle impact behavior

Neither  the  critical  viscosity/velocity  nor  the  energy-based
methods appear able to predict particle sticking for the overall par-
ticle adhesion tests adopting a general approach. The mismatch be-
tween the prediction and the actual results of the tests can be ex-
plained by two reasons. For a specific test, deposits are generated
by a certain combination of particle diameter, temperature, and ve-
locity and therefore, by considering the overall variation of these
quantities during tests, some conditions may generate particle re-
bound. At the same time, particle characteristics such as viscosity
and softening temperature are difficult-to-be-represented by a sin-
gle model able to conceive a wide range of particle chemical com-
positions.

Summing up, a particle impact test reporting adhesion can be
the outcome of multiple superimposed effects in terms of parti-
cle size, temperature and impact conditions. In the last part of the

present work, the generalization of particle impact behavior in a
gas turbine is proposed. Non-dimensional groups listed above (We-
ber, Reynolds, and Ohnesorge numbers), allow for the generaliza-
tion of particle impact/deposition data but describe only the effects
of the impact into particle spread and no information about stick-
ing phenomenon can be gathered.

In order to give a perspective view regarding particle adhesion,
the data reported in Tables 4–6 have to be accompanied by ex-
perimental results related to the other phenomena related to par-
ticulate impact. During gas turbine operation, surface erosion, par-
ticle adhesion, and particle splashing could affect hot sections of
the machinery. Erosion and fouling are generated by the same type
of particles (especially rock-derived particles and coal ashes) and
could take place under different or even the same conditions (such
as temperature, velocity, size). Therefore, the data related to parti-

cle deposition are compared with literature data related to erosion
[149,180,182] and splashing phenomena [144] .

In Table 11 , the data associated with erosion tests are collected
in the same way as the previous ones. Particle dimensions, den-
sity, velocity, temperature, and composition are reported as well as
the softening temperature calculated applying Eqs. (19) –(23) . These
tests refer to hot erosion measurements realized using dedicated
test benches. It is possible to notice how erosion tests are char-
acterized by lower temperature with respect to those involved in
particle deposition tests. In particular, Laki 6 test is very similar to
the Laki 5 test (see Table 5 ) but it is characterized by lower particle
temperature.

In Table 12 , data associated with splashing tests are collected.
These  materials  are  also  among  the  ones  reported  in  Tables  4–
6  and  used  for  the  deposition  tests,  but  in  this  case,  tests  and

Fig. 34.  Particle spread regime using non-dimensional numbers including erosion and splashing tests (particle viscosity values were obtained using the NPL model). Particle
deposition data are reported with grey dots.

particle dimensions are different. These tests consist of a spherical-
pellet of volcanic ash projected at high velocities towards a sub-
strate. Particle splashing is evaluated by checking the digital im-
ages taken during the particle impact during the test [144] . In this
case, particle splashing is the only effect known and no data re-
lated  to  erosion  issues  are  reported.  All  materials  refer  to  three
different  volcanic  ashes  and  the  particle  size  involved  in  these
tests is higher with respect to the previous one. Also, in this case,
the softening temperature values are calculated applying Eqs. (19) –
(23) .

The first analysis shows the plane We-Z, Fig. 34 , populated by
the data reported in Tables 4 –6, Tables 11 and 12 (the viscosity
values are calculated according to the NPL model). Data related to
particle deposition, shown in details in Fig. 32 , are reported using
grey dots in order to highlight the differences with the erosion and
splashing data.

As shown in Fig. 34 , splashing data completely belong to the
region called impact driven , while erosion data belong to the highly
viscous region characterized by very high values of particle Ohne-
sorge number. This non-dimensional analysis shows quite different
impact  regimes  involved  in  particle  deposition  and  particle  ero-
sion/splashing. In the latter cases, the particle is characterized by
size  and/or  velocity  much  more  high  with  respect  to  the  adhe-
sion case. Higher particle Weber number implies a spread regime
driven by the dynamic pressure gradient while lower values of par-
ticle Ohnesorge number implies a resistance force driven by parti-
cle inertia [16] . Erosion data are collected at a lower temperature
with respect to the splashing ones, and as shown in Fig. 34 , vis-
cous effects are much greater and the inertia force is less. There-
fore, erosion phenomenon seems to be characterized by a partic-
ular combination of particle kinetic energy and viscosity able to
determines  particle  impact  with  material  removal  from  the  tar-
get, without adhesion. Even if this distinction appears suitable for
adequately  representing  the  erosion  occurrences,  it  is  important
to note that, especially for higher temperature, erosion issues are
related also to the substrate characteristics [181] . The concurrent
presence of erosion and deposition has been found also in some
numerical analyses performed by the Authors [183] .

From this analysis, a quite clear pattern can be recognized: de-
position, erosion and splashing data belong to different regions in

the We-Z plane, with the particular characteristic that deposition
and erosion regions have in common the values of particle Weber
number (in this case, the most discerning parameter is the particle
viscosity), while deposition and splashing regions have in common
the values of particle Ohnesorge number (in this case, the most
discerning parameter is the particle velocity). Therefore, the com-
bination  of  particle  kinetic  energy  and  surface  tension  seems  to
well describe the deposition, erosion and splashing phenomena.

Starting  from  these  considerations,  two  (2)  new  non-
dimensional  groups  are  proposed.  Based  on  the  Pi  Theorem
proposed in the previous section, by imposing a proper set of co-
efficients, the relation between kinetic energy and surface tension
are
(cid:13)3 = ρd v 2 γ −1
and  by  re-arranging  the  terms  the  third  non-dimensional  group
can be expressed as

The  first  term  represents  the  particle  kinetic  energy  and  the
second  term  represents  the  particle  surface  energy.  As  shown
above, particle kinetic energy and the surface energy work in the
opposite way. If kinetic energy increases, the particle/surface in-
teraction is driven by inertia, while if surface energy increases the
particle/surface interaction is driven by surface energy (i.e. capil-
lary forces). Defining the particle kinetic energy as

The second parameter is related to particle softening. As high-
lighted above, the viscous force determines how particle dissipates
the  kinetic  energy  at  the  impact.  In order  to  represent this,  the

is chosen. As reported, particle viscosity is directly related to parti-
cle temperature via its composition. Each material has proper char-
acteristics and its specific value of softening temperature. This ratio
represents how far the particle is from the softening state, over-
passing the definition of absolute values of particle viscosity, that,
as reported, is difficult-to-be-known. At the same time, the use of
(cid:14) ratio “relative” parameter allows the comparison among differ-
ent conditions. As reported in [84] , working with particle temper-
ature “pure” parameter could misalign the actual operating condi-
tion with the test operating conditions. As described in [84] , glassy
volcanic  ash  softens  at  temperature  values  that  are  considerably
lower than those required for crystalline silicates to start to melt
and,  for  this  reason,  the  use  of  standard  materials  in  laboratory
tests (e.g. MIL E 5007C test sand) instead of actual volcanic ash,
determines no-reliable particle deposition results.

Softening temperature is already used as a threshold value in
the particle sticking model (such as the critical viscosity model)
representing  the  discerning  values  between  sticky  and  no-sticky
particles. As reported in this work, the determination of the soft-
ening temperature for a given material is well defined as a stan-
dard procedure (such as test devices, atmosphere, thermal gradi-
ent, specimen preparation, etc.) that allows the determination of
the characteristic temperature (FT, HT, IT and ST) with a specific
confidence band (see Fig. 5 ) [21] . With the reference of the previ-
ous description, the standard method is affected by a greater inac-
curacy than other ash fusion temperature tests methods (such as
the TMA and DSC) but, for the aim of the present investigation,
this does not represent a limitation due to the fact that the post-
process is based on the particle softening temperature estimation
by means of the Yin et al. [88] model (see Eqs. (19) –(23) for de-
tails). By contrast, the definition of a critical viscosity value and
its relation with temperature are not discovered in details yet [64] .
Differences in viscosity values are detected during tests with con-
stant shear and cooling rates compared with those measured in
variable shear rate and stepwise cooling experiments [64] running
with standard test conditions [65] .

With the present approach, the estimation of the particle be-
havior according to the temperature variation become easier, more
accurate and reproducible rather than the particle viscosity mea-
surement  that  could  be  affected  by  non-univocal  test  methods
[63,184]  and  by  rheological  behavior  due  to  the  possible  non-
Newtonian effects. In fact, silica melts viscosity measurements are
affected  by  three  categories  of  inaccuracy  due  to  (i)  device,  (ii)
material and (iii) fluid behavior [63] . The first one is responsible
for  inadequate  temperature  control  and  geometric  misalignment
within the viscometer while the second determines several uncer-
tainties related to the inhomogeneity due to evaporation, molecu-
lar degradation, improper mixing and phase separation. The latter
category introduces several inaccuracies due to flow instability and
transient phenomena related to non-Newtonian effects.

Using the non-dimensional groups K- (cid:14), Fig. 35 shows the data
collected  for  particle  deposition  ( Tables  4–6 ),  erosion  ( Table  11 )
and splashing ( Table 12 ). Data belonging to the three (3) categories
are clearly subdivided. Particle erosion data are divided from par-
ticle  deposition  data  due  to  the  different  values  of  the  ratio  (cid:14).
Also  splashing  data  are  clearly  distinguished  and  belonging  to  a
region characterized by higher temperature and kinetic energy. In
this case, the ratio K discerns the phenomena.

In the light of the present considerations, specific regions can
be recognized and they are superimposed on the data collection.
In the chart, different impact behaviors are identified as a function
of the literature data. With the reference of Fig. 35 , in the following
description, each region will be analyzed in detail:

• deposition :  this  region  comprises  the  data  reported  in
Tables  4–6 .  The  combination  of  particle  temperature  and
softening  temperature  allows  the  dissipation  of  the  impact
energy by particle deformation determining adhesion. Particles
with these characteristics are too soft to cause erosion issues
and  do  not  have  enough  kinetic  energy  to  determine  the
splashing  phenomenon.  In  fact,  when  particle  temperature  is
higher  than  the  softening  temperature,  the  ratio  K  does  not

136

allow  particle  splashing.  The  erosion  phenomenon  is  related
to  the  strength  of  the  surface  that  strongly  depends  on  the
temperature  values  [185–187]  and  for  this  reason,  a  certain
superimposition  between  the  deposition  and  erosion  regions
has to be considered. Beyond this behavior due to the charac-
teristics of the surface, the overlapping region is related to the
definition  of  the  temperature  ratio  (cid:14) (see  Eq.  (49) ).  As  well
reported in [87] , the melting fraction at the softening temper-
ature  could  be  equal  to  60%  depending  on  the  composition
of  the  ash.  The  correspondence  of  the  melting  fraction  and
the  different  ash  fusion  temperature  values  demonstrate  that
the sticking process starts in correspondence of lower value of
melting fraction. Such experimental evidence confirms that the
sticking process could be characterized by lower temperature
values (than the softening one) and, the extension of the depo-
sition region reported in Fig. 35 seems to be representative of
the phenomenon. The last consideration of the present region
could be related to the non-Newtonian effects during particle
impact. As reported by Giehl [145] , for particles characterized
by a lower content of silica dioxide, the highest velocity impact
does not determine the particle adhesion but, due to the high
value of strain rate, particles bounce off driven by the increased
stiffness;

• erosion/rebound : in this region, the kinetic energy is high and
some particles could rebound determining the associated sur-
face erosion. Particles are characterized by the lower capabil-
ity to deform itself, and, for this reason, the dissipation of the
kinetic  energy  that  characterized  the  particle  upon  impact  is
dissipated through the surface generating dimples and cracks.
Kinetic  energy  associated  with  the  particle  dimension  and
velocity  is  able  to  generate  surface  erosion  as  a  function  of
the substrate resistance. As reported in the literature [188] the
proper prediction of the erosion issue it is possible only when
the particle and substrate characteristics are well known as well
as the kinematic impact condition such as velocity and incom-
ing angle. Due to this fact, the evaluation of the magnitude of
the erosion issue it is not possible with the use of the present
approach,  even  if,  it  is  very  useful  to  identify  which  impact
conditions may be more detrimental (in terms of erosion) than
other;

• erosion/deposition : in this region, particle viscosity plays a dou-
ble role. It is still suitable for generating particle adhesion (the
particle is sufficiently soft) but at the same time, it can deter-
mine erosion issues as well [110] . The particle assumes a vis-
coelastic  property  related  to  a  semi-solid  state.  Experimental
tests conducted in this region should consider the double ef-
fects of particle deposition and particle erosion. The deposits
obtained  during  these  tests  are  affected  by  two  phenomena
and, is not suitable for generating/validate deposition or erosion
models. The outcome of such tests may be the result of the si-
multaneous occurrence of the two effects. Thus erosion might
falsify the final deposition since part of the build-up have been
removed;

• erosion  and  fragmentation :  this  region  is  characterized  by  a
higher  value  of  particle  viscosity  and  higher  kinetic  energy.
Particle  deposition  does  not  take  place,  confirming  the  role
of  the  particle  softening  [189]  (with  the  reference  of  ero-
sion/deposition region explanation). For example, several ero-
sion tests at high temperature (1255 K) using alumina particles
are reported. In this case, (cid:14) is equal to 0.54 and K is equal to
40 and no deposition is detected during tests [190] . Increasing
the particle kinetic energy, the fragmentation increases as well
as the erosion issues [191,192] . Fragmentation is due to the part
of kinetic energy absorbed by the particle during the impact.
This  part  of  the  energy  is  dissipated  by  the  particle  through
its fragmentation. The amount of energy dissipated during this

process is a function of particle velocity and mass, or in other
words, of its kinetic energy. Therefore, starting from a certain
amount of kinetic energy, the erosion phenomenon is accom-
panied by fragmentation. This effect occurs for lower values of
(cid:14) for which the viscoelastic properties of the particle do not
allow sufficient deformation able to dissipate this part of en-
ergy;

• erosion/splashing:  this  region  is  strongly  related  to  the  frag-
mentation one, but the higher values of (cid:14) determine different
particle behavior. As shown in the literature [144] , tests con-
ducted with high particle temperature (1473 K), impact velocity
of 100 m/s and particle diameter equal to few millimeters, gen-
erate an impact characterized by breaking up (yet during the
flight) and extensive deformation on impact with the substrate.
In these tests, the particle kinetic energy is equal to about 1e-
2 J considerably higher than the kinetic energy involved in the
particle deposition tests realized with hot gas turbine section.
Therefore,  even  if  the  viscosity  values  are  suitable  for  gener-
ating particle adhesion, the high values of kinetic energy de-
termine particle break-up (splashing) and limiting particle ad-
hesion, and then, deposits. Particle splashing occurs when the
inertia  force  is  higher  with  respect  to  the  viscous  and  capil-
lary forces. At the same time, the particle splashing generates
a large amount of smaller semi-molten droplet, re-entrained by
a flowing gas [193] , having lower kinetic energy. In this case,
the particle behavior is very similar to the one characteristic of
the deposition region;

• rebound/slip/rivulets : when the kinetic energy diminishes and/or
the particle surface energy increases the particle that impacts
on the surface rebounds or, in the case with very low kinetic
energy particles slip on this. This phenomenon is known as a
lotus  effect  [194–196]  particle/drop slips/rolls on the surface
driven  by  capillary  forces.  Elastic  phenomena  could  influence
the particle impact or by contrast, the particle has extremely
lower energy that the rebound it is not possible;

• no data: in this region, no literature data are available but, in
the track of the former considerations, some hints can be re-
ported. In this region, the values of the ratio (cid:14) imply the vis-
coelastic behavior of particle that could promote rebound (and
the associated erosion issues), but at the same time, the lower
values of  the ratio  K  do  not generate surface  erosion.  There-
fore, if particle adhesion occurs, it is probably due to particu-
lar conditions or to the presence of a third substance or an at-
traction force (for example Van der Walls force) that promotes
particle  sticking.  One  of  the  particular  condition  is  described
well by Sacco et al. [197] . In this experimental test, the ARD
particles impact the surface of the internal cooling holes with
very low velocity and significantly low temperature ( < 728 K).
In these conditions, some particles are trapped in recirculating
and stagnation zones and they repeatedly impact the hot sur-
face at low velocity [197] . Regarding the presence of the third
substance, experimental results [198] have shown that, in the
case of dry conditions, particles are able to stick to the surface
if the impact velocity (in the normal direction) is lower than
a certain limit. When the values of kinetic energy are lower,
due to the smaller particle diameter (0.1–1.5) μm, rather than
lower  velocities,  and  if  a  third  substance  is  present,  particle
sticking  is  promoted.  This  condition  is  very  to  that  found  in
the gas turbine compressor sections. Sub-micro-sized solid par-
ticles are a class of particles that determine compressor fouling
[4] , or in other words, these particles stick under cold condi-
tions. As reported in the literature, compressor fouling is pro-
moted by the presence of third substances at the particle sur-
face interface [53,199] and for these reasons, the adhesion ca-
pability that characterizes this region, could be due to the ef-
fects  of  particular  surface  conditions.  Unfortunately,  detailed

experimental analyses are not reported in the literature. A small
number of contributions (compared to those reported for hot
sections) involved particle sticking analysis relate to cold condi-
tions. On-field detections [199,200] have revealed that only the
first stages are affected by deposits and are driven by the pres-
ence of liquid water at the particle surface interface. Regarding
wind tunnel tests, Kurz et al. [201] reported an experimental
investigation that provides experimental data on the amount of
foulants in the air that stick to a blade surface under dry and
humid conditions. The tests show a higher deposition rate pro-
vided by wet surfaces compared to dry ones. Similar results are
reported in [202] where glue agents on the blade surface en-
hance the particle adhesion rate dramatically. In hot sections,
glue agents are described with the name of vapor deposition
[55,137,169,190,203] . This phenomenon, due to the presence of
a condensed phase downstream the combustor sections, can in-
crease  the  adhesion  capabilities  of  nanoparticles  (mass  mean
diameter  <  0.1 μm)  dragged  in  the  vicinity  of  the  surface  by
diffusion and thermophoresis forces, especially in the presence
of film cooling. Vapor particles migrate through the boundary
layer toward the cool wall. If the boundary layer temperature
is below the dew point, condensation takes place at the wall
[204] .

8. Remarks

In this final part, the impact behavior map, early proposed, was
checked against several different cases. The first analysis refers to
the particle sticking data already used for the map identification,
for which a detailed subdivision between the reported results (see

Tables  4–6 )  is  performed  (if  possible).  In  particular,  Fig.  36  re-
ports the impact behavior map with the superimposition of sev-
eral different tests divided according to silty ( Fig. 36 a), coal-like
( Fig. 36 b), and volcanic ash particles. Volcanic ashes are reported
in both Fig. 36 c and d for improving the readability. Each bounded
region represents the covered region on the impact behavior map
according to the test conditions, while the solid-colored red-region
represent the test condition for which the Authors have reported
the most detrimental effects related to particle sticking. Clear vis-
ible is the presence of contradictory results in the region named
erosion/deposition  (see  the  map  description  early  reported)  for
which,  tests  conducted  with  silty  and  coal-like  particles,  do  not
show a high amount of deposits, while tests carried out with vol-
canic ashes show the greatest sticky conditions. Therefore, even if
each test is carried out for studying particle adhesion, not all of the
particle impact conditions generate particle sticking, or in a better
way, a particular condition could be more detrimental than other.
This distinction, carried out in a qualitative way (due to the lack of
information that characterizes the test reports), shows how each
impact test is characterized by its own peculiarities, and, only by
unpacking the impact behavior into its fundamentals, the compar-
ison between different tests can be done.

Looking into the analysis, it is clear how the data is very dis-
persed, but, at the same time, it can draw two major considera-
tions: (i) particle sticking is greater moving towards high values of
(cid:14) while (ii) the relationship between the ratio K and the sticking
condition is not univocal. This means that the effects of particle in-
ertia and the interaction between the particle and substrate are not
straightforward. For example, the combination of particle size and
velocity changes the heating process and may affect the deposition

process [145] . For the same velocity, smaller particles (lower values
of K) are heated-up quicker than bigger particles (higher values of
K) changing the results of the particle impact.

In the second analysis, K- (cid:14) map presented in Fig. 35 is checked
against  two  different  cases.  The  first  one  is  related  to  experi-
mental tests for measuring the coefficient of restitution (COR) at
high temperature [205–207] . Tests were performed with ARD and
Table 13 reports their characteristics. The second one is related to
experimental tests for evaluating the erosion due to droplets im-
pact [208–210] . Tests were performed with water and Table 14 re-
ports their characteristics.

Fig.  37  shows  the  superimposition  of  literature  data  reported
in Tables 13 and 14 on the K- (cid:14) map. The tests performed with
ARD are collocated in the erosion/rebound region. These tests are
realized with the aim of measuring the rebound characteristics of
ARD particles confirming the region highlighted in the K- (cid:14) map.
In  particular,  ARD  COR  3  tests  conducted  with  higher  tempera-
ture (close to 1373 K) belong to the mixed region erosion/rebound-

deposition. Deposition effects are recognized during the tests real-
ized for measuring COR of ARD particles at high temperature [206] .
In detail, starting from about 1250 K (corresponding to (cid:14) = 0.92) to
about 1370 K (corresponding to (cid:14) = 1.01) particle deposition takes
place. A certain number of particles stick to the target surface as
well  as  the  remaining  particles  bounce  on  the  target  defining  a
specific value of COR. This experimental evidence, obtained with
an experimental apparatus design for calculating rebound charac-
teristics of micro-sized particles, confirms a particular region char-
acterized by particle rebound/erosion and particle deposition.

The tests performed with water droplet are located in the ero-
sion/splashing  region.  These  tests  are  realized  with  the  aim  of
measuring the erosion provided by water droplets. Bigger droplets
and/or higher impact velocities are collocated in the upper region,
where splashing is higher. The K- (cid:14) map provided also, in this case,
a good prediction of the actual behavior even if, the comparison
with water droplets over-stresses the hypotheses under which the
K- (cid:14) map exists. In fact, across the T
soft , all materials considered
for the K- (cid:14) map identification, show a continuous trend of the re-
lation μ-T . By contrast, water is characterized by a step function of
the μ-T trend across the T

soft (that represents ice melting).

8.1. Limitations and perspectives

Particle  sticking  tests,  collected  in  the  present  review,  cover
all materials responsible for the gas turbine fouling phenomenon
(silty,  volcanic  ash  and  coal-like  particles).  Starting  from  these
tests,  an  original  data  post-process  based  on  non-dimensional
groups has generated the K- (cid:14) Map, in which several different re-
sults of a generic particle impact can be a priori determined. The
identification  of  the  K- (cid:14) Map  by  means  of  several  independent
experimental results related to the evaluation of restitution coef-
ficients  and  droplet  erosion  has  confirmed  that  the  adopted  ap-
proach  seems  promising  for  using  the  K- (cid:14) Map  as  a  predictive
tool. The K- (cid:14) prediction is can be considered reliable as the im-
pact conditions (particle chemical composition and substrate char-
acteristics) are similar to those considered in the present literature
data collection.

After a detailed analysis of the literature, two main aspects have
to be considered for the proper interpretation of the results: (i) the
effects of the local temperature variation due to the film cooling on
the blade surface and (ii) the effects of mutual interaction between
particle and the substrate at a given temperature. Particle thermal
characteristic (such as conductivity, specific heat, etc.) and the ef-
fects of glue agent due to the particular combination of chemical
composition and temperature, could affect the result of a particle
impact. These aspects should be considered in the use of K- (cid:14) Map
and may represent the basis for further improvements in particle
deposition research.

9. Conclusions

The present analysis is based on literature data related to the
experimental  tests  on  particle  deposition  carried  out  with  hot
gas turbine sections-like conditions. Several considerations about

particle adhesion were highlighted associated to the physical be-
havior of particle impact. Analyzing the particle deposition mod-
els,  it  is  clear  how the  modeling of  particle deposition is still  a
challenge. Different analytical models exist, based on experimen-
tal evidence or on basic physics principle. The model applied the
most is the critical viscosity model. This model is easy to be im-
plemented (also in a computational fluid dynamic model) but at
the same time does not consider other influences on particle de-
position like surface tension and particle kinetic energy. Regard-
ing  other  models,  for  example,  the  energy  balance  model,  the
spread  factor  parameter  seems  not  to  be  completely  exhaustive
of the particle adhesion. Erosion phenomena are characterized by
higher values of particle viscosity and particle kinetic energy but,
the  energy-based  model  still  predicts  an  adhesion-like  behavior.
The interaction between particle and surface is driven by the par-
ticle characteristics at the impact (e.g. velocity and particle mass)
and the characteristics of the surface (e.g. surface tension or the
presence of a third substance). At the same time, the sticking mod-
els  are  based  on  the  calculation  of  particle  viscosity  that  is  es-
timated  by  means  of  predictive  models  accounting  for  the  par-
ticle  chemical  composition.  As  demonstrated,  the  estimation  of
particle  viscosity  variation  according  to  temperature  is  not-
univocal depending on the test method or the set of materials used
for model data regression.

Based  on  over  seventy  (70)  experimental  tests  related  to  gas
turbine hot sections reported in the literature, the proposed non-
dimensional particle impact behavior map summarizes all the pos-
sible effects of particle impact on surfaces. The non-dimensional
parameters,  used  to  identify  the  results  of  particle  impact,  are
based on the assessment of particle velocity, temperature, mass,
surface tension and softening temperature. On this basis, a proper
characterization of particle material is required using (i) standard
tests (if exist) or (ii) predictive model of particle density, surface
tension and softening temperature.

The  generalization  of  the  results  is  provided  by  using  non-
dimensional  groups  able  to  represent  different  particle  im-
pact  behavior.  All  of  the  recognized  regions  ( deposition ,  re-
bound/slip/rivulets , erosion/rebound , erosion and fragmentation, and
erosion/splashing )  are  related  to  specific  experimental  evidences
found in literature which highlight several effects involved in gas
turbine fouling.

A particular region named no data is also proposed. This region
is characterized by lower particle kinetic energy, higher viscosity
values, and no available literature data. Therefore, what is the rea-
son for this lack of data for interpretation? Are these particle con-
ditions involved in gas turbine particle deposition? Are these con-
ditions easy to be studied by experimental tests?

These questions are still open and further studies will be de-
voted to discover particle impact behavior and improve the knowl-
edge about all recognized regions. Therefore, with reference to the
sensitivity analysis and data post-process reported in the present
work, three main outcomes can be drawn:

• the mutual correlation between the particle sticking predictive
model and the model used for estimating particle characteris-
tics  (in  particular  particle  viscosity)  determine  the  quality  of

the sticking prediction. Given this, the selection of the predic-
tive models has to be pondered according to the particle chem-

• the use of non-dimensional groups may represent the starting
point for improving the knowledge of the gas turbine fouling
and,  in  a  wider  scenario,  could  represent  a  valid  support  for
extracting general laws useful for improving the capability of
numerical tools, in the particle impact simulation;

• the predictive map can be used for estimating the particle stick-
ing capability as well as the effects of a generic particle impact
(such as erosion, splashing, etc.) characterized by specific im-
pact conditions and particle characteristics. This approach could
be useful for designing an experimental test (such as the selec-
tion of the particle chemical composition, gas temperature, etc.)
or, the analysis in greater detail, for characterizing a specific op-
erating condition of the power unit.

Experimental analyses and analytical models have to take into
account the effects of the presence of third material (such as water,
oily substances, etc.) at the particle/surface interface, implying sev-
eral difficulties for modeling gas turbine particle deposition. All of
these aspects represent the upcoming challenges, considering that
both experimental and numerical analyses have to reflect the ac-
tual conditions in which the gas turbine operates.

Appendix A

In the present Appendix, the constitutive equations of the seven
(7) viscosity methods with all model coefficients and applicability
limits are reported. In the following equations, viscosity values are
expressed in [Pa s] while temperature values are expressed in [K].

A.1. NPL model

The first method, called the NPL model (National Physical Lab-
oratory) [69] , is based on the optical basicity. The optical basicity
is a quantity related to the mole fraction χ and number of oxygen
atoms n in the melt and is used to classify oxides on a scale of
acidity referred to the same O 2 − base. Optical Basicity of glasses
and slags is derived from the Lewis acidity/basicity concept. The
expression of the Non-Corrected (NC) optical basicity (cid:16)NC is

(cid:16)NC =

(cid:12) χ
(cid:12) χ

i n i (cid:16)i
i n i

where the values of the theoretical optical basicity (cid:16) are listed in
Table A1 .

Optical basicity can be corrected for the cations required for the
charge balance of the aluminum oxide according to the correction
proposed by Duffy and Ingram [211] , used in [212] , the Corrected
(C) optical basicity (cid:16)C is calculated as

As  reported  in  [70] ,  the  model  coefficients  reported  in
Eq.  (A9)  were  calculated  by  data  regression  of  the  temperature-
viscosity trends based on sixty-two (62) samples of slags that cov-
ered the range of chemical composition in term of weight fraction
listed below:

• CaO = (1 – 37) wt%;
• MgO = (1 – 12) wt%;
2 = (31 – 59) wt%;

• Al

• Fe

In addition, the model is valid when the silica ratio value is in
3 is in the
the range of 45 – 75 and the value of the ratio SiO
range of 1.2 – 2.3. These values represent the applicability limits
of the present model. The model will be applied only for the gas
turbine contaminants which chemical composition match with the
listed limits.

This model is the oldest considered in the present review. Its
accuracy is estimated in [70] and in [68] by considering the pre-
dicted temperature correspondent to a determined viscosity value.
In both cases, the model underpredicts the temperature values. In
particular, Hoy et al. [70] estimated an accuracy band of 44 K while
Vargas et al. [68] estimated an accuracy band of 66 K. All the pre-
dicted points correspond to a lower temperature than the experi-
mental data. This means that for a given temperature, the S 2 pre-
dict a lower value of particle viscosity.

A.3. Slope and intercept model

The third method is based on the slope and intercept model,
usually called Watt and Fereday (WF) model [71] . The basis of the
model is a recalculation of the composition identical to that of the
S 2 model, reported in the Eq. (A7) . The viscosity can be calculated
according to

(A6)

log μ =

m WF 10 7
( T − 423 ) 2

+ c WF

(A10)

The two parameters, m

WF , should be calculated from
the species concentrations recalculated in weight percent accord-
ing to the following expressions

WF  and c

m WF = 0 . 0 0835 Si O 2 + 0 . 0 0601 A l 2 O 3 − 0 . 109

+ 0 . 0160 CaO − 3 . 92

(A12)

The correlation was derived by data regression of British coal
ashes on the basis of measurements on one hundred and thirteen
(113) ashes samples that covered the range of chemical composi-
tion in terms of weight fraction listed below:

• CaO = (2 – 30) wt%;
• MgO = (1 – 10) wt%;
2 = (30 – 60) wt%;
• SiO
3 = (15 – 35) wt%;
• Al

The correction for optical basicity is not required when χCaO +
χMgO ≤ χ
3 because at this condition, the aluminum oxide will
behave as basic oxide and the Al 3 + ions will not incorporated into
the  Si 4 +  chain  or  rig.  In  this  case,  the  Eq.  (A1)  is  applied  as  is,
without correction.

ered in the present work estimates the viscosity according to

The accuracy of the present method is not reported in the orig-
inal work [69] . However, by using the data proposed by Duffy and
Ingram [211] , it is possible to estimate the deviations between the
theoretical and the experimental optical basicity values. The data
refers  to  glassy  materials  and  they  are  reported  in  Fig.  A1 .  The
confidence  band  is  ± 8.7%  wide  and  it  is  representative  of  the
maximum deviation between theoretical and experimental values
(dashed lines in the graph).

A.2. Modified silica ratio model

The second method is the modified silica ratio S 2 model [70] .
The  S 2  is  based  on  studies  of  coal  ash  slags,  containing  silicon,
aluminum,  iron,  calcium  and  magnesium  as  major  components.
The model relates the viscosity-temperature characteristics of liq-
uid  slags  with  their  chemical  composition,  and  it  is  based  on  a
recalculation  of  the  compositional  analysis  of  the  slag  in  which
all ferrous is assumed in the presence of Fe
3  according to the
weight fraction
Si O 2 + A l 2 O 3 + Equiv . F e 2 O 3 + CaO + MgO = 100%

In addition, the model is valid when the silica ratio value is in
the range of 40 – 80 and the value of the ratio SiO
3 is in the
range of 1.4 – 2.4. These values represent the applicability limits
of the present model. The model will be applied only for the gas
turbine contaminants which chemical composition match with the
listed limits.

2 /Al

As mentioned, this model is based on the S 2 model, and in the
same way, underpredicts the temperature for a determined viscos-
ity value. In particular, for a viscosity equal to 25 Pa s this model
underpredicts the temperature values up to 180 K [68] . In the work
of Watt and Feredey [71] , there is a detailed description of the un-
certainty related to three sources (instrumental error, analytical er-
ror, and error due to irregularities in the behavior of the slag). A
confidence band equal to ± 0.29 log unit in Poise at 95% is also
indicated by the Authors [71] .

In  order  to  evaluate  the  accuracy  of  this  model,  it  is  neces-
sary to make reference to the earlier model proposed by Urbain
et al. [213] . With the isothermal deformation method, the uncer-
tainty  related  to  the  viscosity  values  is  equal  to  ± 10%  [68] .  By
considering the prediction of temperature values for a given vis-
cosity, the confidence band is ± 4.5 K wide for temperature values
higher than 1873 K, while is ± 10 K wide for temperature values
lower than 1875 K.

A.4. Urbain model

A.5. RRLG method

The fourth method is based on Urbain’s formulation [213] used
for the viscosity estimation of silicate and aluminosilicates melts at
high temperature. An improved physical model of this formulation
is  proposed  by  Senior  and  Srinivasachar  [214]  extending  the  va-
lidity of the equation to low temperature. The same temperature-
composition correlation is applied by Sreedharan and Tafti (S&T)
[72] . Starting from this formulation, the particle viscosity is calcu-
lated with adjusted coefficients reported in [68] obtained for pre-
dicting the viscosity of ash particles in combustion systems up to
10 9 Pa  s.  This  model  is  used  to  predict  particle  viscosity  in  sev-
eral  studies  related  to  particle  impact/deposition  on  gas  turbine
hot sections [23,28,215,216] . This model is able to predict the par-
ticle viscosity with the following limits:

• SiO

showed a relative difference with a maximum deviation equal to

thors in [74] proposed a correction term based on viscosity mea-
surement of seventeen (17) Western US lignite and sub-bituminous
coal slags belonging to low-rank coal over the temperature range
of (1423 – 1753) K. The viscosity is calculated according to the ex-

Table A3 summarizes the constitutive equations and the appli-
cability  limits  (if  present)  of  all  viscosity  models.  The  limits  are
shown in terms of weight fraction or molar weight according to
the model definition. Additional notes are added for limits related
to silica ratio, SiO
3  ratio and minor constituents (e.g. tita-
nium oxide).

Appendix B

The  particle  deposition  tests  collected  in  Tables  4–6  are  re-
ported in this Appendix with the reference of particle Stokes num-
ber and particle relaxation time values. For each test, the geometric
features of the target are included in the related reference. Particle
Stokes number is calculated according to

St =

ρ d 2 v
18 μg L

(B1)

where the characteristic target length L is affected by inaccuracy
as reported below. Particle relaxation time is not affected by these
inaccuracies and is calculated according to

τ =

ρ d 2
18 μg
In the presence of a certain variability range of particle diam-
eter and temperature, a single average value is assumed as rep-
resentative of the entire test. The values of the former variables
of  Stokes  number  and  particle  relaxation  time  are  reported  in
Tables B1 –B3 as well as the type of target and its shape. In several
cases, the geometric characteristics of the target are not reported
in  detail  and  for  this  reason,  they  are  estimated  using  sketches

(B2)

and figures reported in the correspondent reference with unavoid-
able inaccuracies. In these cases, the target dimensions reported in
Tables B1 –B3 are marked with a cross.

According  to  the  type  of  target,  the  characteristic  length  L  is

calculated according to the following rules:

• tests performed on a full-scale gas turbine (T): a representa-
tive chord equal to 50 mm was assumed as characteristic length
L for all the tests, excluding the tests called EYJA (Naraparaju
et al. [150] ) and Laki 5 (Shinozaki et al. [149] ) for which the
chord  of  the  first  nozzle  was  estimated  using  the  sketch  re-
ported in the reference;

• tests performed on wind tunnels provided with cascade or sin-
gle blade targets (B): the airfoil chord was assumed as charac-
teristic length L ;

• tests performed using a coupon (C): the diameter (if circular)
or the hydraulic diameter (if rectangular) of the coupon holder
were assumed as the characteristic length L ;

• tests performed in order to discover particle deposition inside
the internal cooling hole (I): the diameter of the circular holes
was assumed as characteristic length L .

The dynamic viscosity of the carrier gas is assumed equal to
that of pure air at the same temperature and calculated according
to CoolProp library [165] for a reference pressure (absolute) equal
to  2 bar.  In  some  tests,  the  carrier  gas  came  from  a  combustion
chamber in which natural gas or other types of fuels (syngas or
heavy fuels) were burned.

For  all  of  these  reasons,  the  Stokes  number  and  particle  re-
laxation time, as well as the characteristics length L reported in
Tables B1 –B3 , are only useful for an order of magnitude analysis.

Appendix C

In  this  Appendix,  the  molar  fraction  values  for  the  materials
collected  in  Tables  4–6  are  reported.  Since  the  correspondence

of  weight  fraction  and  the  molar  fraction  values  are  based  on
the specific chemical composition, Tables C1 –C3 complete the in-
formation  of  particle  chemical  composition  used  in  the  present

Appendix D

In this Appendix, the data related to the particle viscosity are
reported. Figs. D1 and D2 show the viscosity-temperature trend,
while  in  Tables  D1 –D3  the  viscosity  critical  values  are  reported
according to the viscosity model. Finally, in these tables, several
data related to the source of contamination, typology, and material
characteristics are also reported.

Fig.  D1  reports  the  variation  of  the  particle  viscosity  as  a
function  of  the  temperature,  according  to  the  NPL  model.  For  a
given  temperature,  the  viscosity  variation  is  almost  six  (6)  or-

ders  of  magnitude  for  lower  temperatures  and  three  (3)  orders
of  magnitude  for  higher  temperatures  while  the  majority  of  the
data  is  localized  in  the  range  of  (1  – 10 4 )  Pa  s.  Fig.  D1  re-
ports  the  viscosity  prediction  according  to  the  different  mod-
els  (S 2  [70] ,  WF  [71] ,  S&T  [72] ,  RRLG  [73] ,  SDS  [74]  and  GRD
[75] ). Each model is applied within its validity limits and, in or-
der to highlight the differences, the viscosity prediction obtained
with  the  NPL  model  are  reported  in  red.  Therefore,  the  shape
and  grey-scale  color  (empty  with  black  bound,  solid  black  and
grey) represent the model predictions according to the chart la-
bel,  while  the  red-scale  (empty  with  red  bound,  solid  red  and

pale  red)  represent  the  NPL  predictions.  Considering  all  predic-
tions, the viscosity values vary in a sixteen-orders-of-magnitude-
wide  range.  The  trends  are  very  similar  to  each  other,  even
if  the  predictions  provided  by  the  WF  model  show  a  different
trend.  The  values  reported  in  Figs.  D1  and  D2 ,  in  conjunction
with those reported in Figs. 11 and 12 , represent the comprehen-
sive  analysis  of  the  viscosity  behavior  of  the  considered  particle
materials.
