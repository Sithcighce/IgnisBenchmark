The gaseous Inverse Jet Diffusion Flame (IJDF) is a unique nonpremixed flame that can be established in a simple
coaxial burner when central air jet surrounded by annular fuel jet is ignited. The active research on laminar IJDF
was initiated in the early 1980’s, with a primary focus on its sooting characteristics. The soot formation, evo-
lution and morphology in inverse jet diffusion flame differ fundamentally from that of the normal jet diffusion
flame  (NJDF)  due  to  its  distinct  reactant  delivery  mode  and  fluid  dynamics.  The  unique  feature  of  the  IJDF
configuration is its reduced soot formation as compared to the NJDF configuration, particularly at higher air-fuel
velocity ratio, even for hydrocarbon fuels. The literature has reported six types of laminar IJDF based on visual
appearance  and  air-fuel  velocity  ratio.  Furthermore,  laminar  IJDF  is  mainly  utilized  as  a  lab-scale  flame  by
various researchers for the fundamental investigation of soot evolution in nonpremixed flames. Unlike normal jet
diffusion flame, which is established with the fuel jet enveloped by an oxidizer jet, the post-flame emissions and
the flame stability aspects of turbulent IJDF are relatively less understood. From a global perspective, coherence
in  the  research  on  inverse  jet  diffusion  flame  is  lacking  and  there  is  a  need  for  an  extensive  investigation  to
understand this special type of nonpremixed flame. The present review identifies different emerging areas related
to IJDF that the combustion researchers can pursue in the future.

Various aspects of laminar and turbulent IJDF, such as flame structure, soot formation, flame height, flame
stability, thermal and emission characteristics are discussed in this review. This review may serve as a reference
that contributes to the research perspectives on laminar and turbulent inverse jet diffusion flames for adapting
the favourable aspects of this flame configuration in a wide range of industrial and domestic applications.

Combustion  has  widespread  applications  in  power  generation,
transportation, process industry, household and industrial heating [1].
However, developing a combustion system with low pollutant emissions
and high efficiency is challenging and continued to be pursued by the
combustion community [2–5]. Several clean and efficient combustion
technologies  have  been  adopted  in  practical  combustors,  namely
flameless combustion [6–9], high-temperature air combustion [10–12],
and excess enthalpy combustion [13]. These technologies use exhaust
heat  recovery,  resulting  in  low  NOx  emissions  [14,15],  uniform  tem-
perature distribution and high thermal efficiency [16].

Practical  combustion  systems  generally  prefer  nonpremixed  or
diffusion mode of combustion due to wider operating range and safety
aspects as compared to premixed combustion. Moreover, conventional
combustors usually manifest air-fuel jets in coaxial tube configuration to
realize  diffusion  flame,  commonly  referred  as  the  jet  diffusion  flame.
The  jet  diffusion  flame  can  be  classified  into  two  types  based  on  the
relative  position  of  air  and  fuel  delivery  in  the  coaxial  tubes.  The  jet
diffusion  flame  established  in  the  coaxial  burner  with  the  ignition  of
central fuel jet surrounded by annular air/oxidizer jet is called Normal
Jet Diffusion Flame (NJDF). In contrast, the ignition of annular fuel jet
and central oxidizer/air jet in coaxial burner configuration results in a
unique  jet  diffusion  flame,  called  Inverse  Jet  Diffusion  Flame  (IJDF)
which  is  the  main  subject  of  this  review. Both  laminar  and  turbulent
inverse jet diffusion flames will be denoted by the acronym “IJDF”  in
this review article. Moreover, the present review is concerned only with
axisymmetric IJDF stabilized in circular port burners with gaseous re-
actants. Due to the change in the relative position of fuel and oxidizer
injection in this flame configuration, soot and its precursors, i.e., Poly
Aromatic  Hydrocarbons  (PAH),  evolve  in  the  annular  fuel  stream
without crossing into the high-temperature flame zone resulting in the
formation of unoxidized incipient soot in the exhaust [17–20]. The peak
soot  volume  fraction  in  laminar  IJDF  is  also  smaller  by  an  order  of
magnitude than the NJDF for same air-fuel velocity ratio [17]. In the
case of turbulent IJDF, the higher relative velocity (Ve) between air and
fuel jets ensures better fuel entrainment and enhanced mixing, resulting
in shorter visible flame height than the NJDF [21,22].

1.1. Motivation for inverse jet diffusion flame research

Laminar  inverse  jet  diffusion  flame  (IJDF)  is  a  canonical  lab-scale
flame  configuration  suitable  for  extracting  incipient  soot  particles

from the flame  zone with minimal interference compared to the con-
ventional normal jet diffusion flame configuration. This is mainly due to
the relative port arrangement of fuel and oxidizer jet streams in IJDF and
its  unique  jet  flow  dynamics.  In addition,  IJDF  is  one  of  the  simplest
configuration suitable for investigating soot formation and the associ-
ated flame radiation in microgravity environments which, in turn, can
provide valuable information on flame spread in microgravity that are
crucial for crew fire safety in long duration space explorations [23–25].
The understanding gained from investigating laminar IJDF (particularly
from soot formation and radiation studies in terrestrial and microgravity
atmospheres)  can  provide  critical  information  for  developing  more
advanced and robust numerical combustion codes for predicting more
complex soot evolution phenomena accurately. Also, reliable data from
IJDF  obtained  using  nonintrusive  advanced  laser  diagnostics  such  as
Laser-Induced  Incandescence  (LII)  for  soot  radiation,  Particle  Image
Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) can be
utilized  from  benchmarking  numerical  simulation  codes.  Apart  from
that,  the  IJDF  configuration  has  been  used  extensively  to  synthesize
nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide, silica and Carbon Nano Tubes
(CNTs) with wide-reaching applications in aerospace, mechanical, and
electronics domain [26,27].

Turbulent inverse jet diffusion flame is a typical flame configuration
utilized  in  furnaces  for  flame  impingement  heating  of  metal  load
because  of  its  capability  for  optimally  controlling  the  air-fuel  mo-
mentum ratio to alter the flame temperature and radiation characteris-
tics [28–32]. In addition to its superior fuel-air mixing, enhanced flame
stability can be observed in turbulent IJDF, making it a suitable candi-
date for aerospace and industrial combustors [33–36]. Also, turbulent
IJDF provides an extended region of partial premixing of oxidizer and
fuel jets without flame flashback as compared to flashback-prone pre-
mixed flames [37,38]. The rocket combustors employ inverse jet diffu-
sion flame configuration with central liquid oxygen (LOX) and annular
hydrogen/methane jets from multiple coaxial injectors in high-pressure
supercritical  environments  to  avoid  excessive  oxidation  of  the
combustor  walls  [39].  In  order  to  consolidate  the  research  outcomes
related to IJDF and assess its present status, there is a need for a review

that critically analyses the various aspects of this unique type of non-
premixed flame. Hence, the current work aims to review the literature
on laminar and turbulent gaseous IJDF to gain a broad perspective and
analyse its scope in practical combustion applications. Further, this re-
view is expected to highlight the research gaps on IJDF and encompass
future perspectives.

1.2. Organization of this review

This review article is organized into different sections. subsection 1.3
discusses  various  burner  types  utilized  by  researchers  for  stabilizing
laminar and turbulent IJDF. Section 2 and its subsections elaborate on
the flame structure of IJDF. This will be followed by section 3 on soot
formation and a subsequent discussion on flame height (section 4) of
IJDF along with various semi-empirical correlations available in litera-
ture for estimating IJDF flame height. The flame stability and the post
flame  emission  characteristics  of  IJDF  are  reviewed  subsequently  in
section  which  help  in  designing  and  developing  low-emission  IJDF
based combustion systems for various industrial and domestic applica-
tions.  A  section  on  emerging  applications  of  IJDF  follows  post  flame
emission  characteristics  discussion.  Based  on  the  above  sections,  a
summary of challenges and research prospects of IJDF is synthesized.

1.3. Lab-scale IJDF burner configurations and operating conditions

Turbulent  coaxial  air-fuel  jets  are  often  preferred  in  combustion
applications to improve fuel-air mixing and enhance heat release rate.
The turbulent jets can effectively entrain and mix the surrounding fluid,
moving with relatively low momentum as compared to the laminar jets
[21,22,40].  Interestingly,  the  turbulent  central  air  jet  in  the  IJDF
configuration is expected to enhance the entrainment and mixing of low
momentum  annular  fuel  jet,  which  can  produce  a  nonluminous  blue
flame with shorter visible flame height.

The distinct features of a typical turbulent inverse jet diffusion flame
is shown in Fig. 1. The initial study on laminar IJDF by Wu and Essen-
high  [42]  was  extended  to  the  turbulent  regime  by  Wenzell  [43],
Sobiesiak and Wenzell [21], who investigated the turbulent natural gas
IJDF characteristics using color schlieren visualization. The separated
red and blue streaks in the color schlieren on either side of the central air
jet in IJDF were attributed to the unmixed air-fuel region by them. The
even-colored regions from the schlieren indicated a well-mixed zone in
the shear region and the jet central axis. This study concluded that the

air-fuel jet velocity ratio affected the flame stability, thermal and flame
height  characteristics  of  turbulent  IJDF.  However,  present  authors
consider  the  air-fuel  momentum  ratio  to  be  an  appropriate  global
parameter to characterize IJDF in place of the air-fuel velocity ratio. The
air-fuel velocity ratio does not consider the effect of fuel/oxidizer den-
sity ratio in describing the extent of fuel-oxidizer mixing in IJDF. Apart
from  this  study,  various researchers  have  experimentally  investigated
IJDF in CoA burner configuration in the laminar and turbulent regime,
as  summarized  in  Table  1.  The  tabulated  literature  indicates  that the
operating  range  of  fuels,  namely  natural  gas,  methane,  and  LPG,  is
restricted to the laminar regime. On the other hand, the operating range
of air-jet velocity varies from transition to turbulent regime for most of
the studies reported. The research works tabulated in Table 1 reported
the  flame  height,  visible  appearance,  and  stability  characteristics  of
IJDF, which will be extensively discussed in the subsequent sections.

The  literature  on  CoA  and  circumferentially  arranged  port  (CAP)
burner  stabilized  inverse  diffusion  flame  is  severely  limited  when
compared to NJDF. Table 2 lists the various literature available on CAP
burners, along with their geometry details and operating conditions. The
CAP burner stabilized IJDF appears bluish and compact as compared to
its  CoA  counterpart.  Despite  these  observations,  the  flame  stability
characteristics of CAP stabilized IJDF and their blowout mechanism for
a wider operating range are not reported in literature. Sze et al. [47]
observed shorter flame height and intense mixing in butane IJDF sta-
bilized in circumferentially arranged fuel ports. The comparison of IJDF
with  premixed  impingement  flame  showed  that  uniform  heating  was
achieved  with  inverse  diffusion  flame  around  the  stagnation  point.
However, this investigation was limited to a fixed number of circum-
ferential fuel ports in the CAP burner.

Recently Miao et al. [55] investigated the effects of hydrogen addi-
tion, oxygen concentration, and overall equivalence ratio on the flame
structure  of  the  LPG  CAP  IJDF.  They  reported  that  the  oxygen
enhancement significantly improved the combustion characteristics. All
these reported experimental works on CAP stabilized IJDF are devoid of
semi-empirical correlations  for characterizing CAP IJDF in a  range of
operating conditions, which can help to design and develop robust CAP
burner configuration.

Different  burner  configurations  namely  Recessed  and  Unrecessed
Coaxial  (CoA)  burner,  Swirl  burner,  Backstep  burner,  and  Circum-
ferentially Arranged Port (CAP) burner, have been developed by various

researchers  for  stabilizing  inverse  jet  diffusion  flame  [58,59,61–65,
67–70,83].  However,  most  conventional  designs  incorporate  CoA
configuration, as shown in Fig. 2(b), where high-velocity central air jet is
surrounded by an annular, low velocity fuel jet. Compared to the NJDF,
the  relative  momentum  between  air-fuel  jet  interface  enhances  fuel
entrainment and air-fuel mixing for a CoA burner stabilized Inverse Jet
diffusion Flame. As fuel jet issues from the annular gap of CoA burner, it
is in contact with both central air jet and outer ambient air. Hence, there
can  be  formation  of  secondary  flames  between  annular  fuel  jet  and
ambient air. However, this secondary flame formation depends upon the
air-fuel velocity ratio and burner diameter ratio. For the investigation of
laminar  IJDF  related  to  flame  structure,  soot  formation,  flame  height
etc., researchers have utilized an outer annular inert co-flow to suppress
these secondary flames as it may hinder the understanding of certain
phenomena  such  as  soot  formation.  The  backstep  burner  is  a  burner
configuration with the inner tube recessed below the burner exit along
with a backstep region present in the fuel delivery stream, as shown in
Fig. 2(c). The backstep and recessed coaxial burners enhance the extent
of  air-fuel  partial  premixing  before  reaching  the  burner  exit,  thereby
influencing the thermochemical nature of IJDF [58,59,70,83,84].

The  Circumferentially  Arranged  Port  Inverse  Jet  diffusion  flame
configuration replaces the annular fuel port with several circular fuel
ports around the turbulent central air jet (Fig. 2(a) and d). This modi-
fication  enables  to  achieve  higher  interaction  between  air-fuel  jets
through  increased  surface  area  contact.  The  swirl  in  the  inverse  jet
diffusion flame configuration is induced in the swirl burner either by
incorporating vanes in the duct or injecting air through tangential ports
as shown in Fig. 2(e). The swirl flow creates a recirculation zone of re-
actants and hot products, which acts as a radical pool for igniting the
incoming reactants and anchoring the flame at high velocities. The flow
pattern of an unconfined swirl IJDF is shown in Fig. 3, for SN = 9.12 and
air Re = 8000. The flame visualization indicates the development of the
internal recirculation zone in CAP IJDF due to axial adverse pressure
gradient  caused  by  swirling  air  jet  [72].  The  swirl  IJDF  produces
jet-vortex  interaction,  which  results  in  low-velocity  air  pockets  that
enhance flame stabilization in high Re flows [71].

Rocket  engines  and  staged  combustion  systems  are  some  of  the
diverse fields where inverse jet diffusion flames are employed [35,36,73,
145].  In  rocket  engine  combustion  chambers,  the  center  oxidizer  is
injected with an annular hydrogen jet to reduce combustor wall oxida-
tion [39].

2. Flame structure of inverse jet diffusion flame

The examination of flame structure helps in understanding various
physical processes taking place in the flame zone. The species concen-
tration profiles, temperature, OH, PAH and soot distributions measured
in the flame zone provide a detailed description of the IJDF structure.
Furthermore, the species concentration measurements in the flame will
help formulate a detailed chemical kinetics model that can predict the
flame structure well [74,75]. Besides this, the visible appearance and the
flame luminosity help to decipher the extent of soot formation and its
associated radiation.

2.1. Flame appearance through visual observation and
chemiluminescence

Wu and Essenhigh [42] carried out the first detailed experimental
and computational study on laminar methane IJDF. They classified six
different types of laminar IJDF (namely Type I-Type to VI flames) based
on air-fuel jet velocities at the burner exit and stoichiometry as shown in
Fig. 4.

These types of flames are (I) Weak blue stable flames (II) Stable blue
flame with faint orange-yellow cap (III) stable intense blue flame with
larger intense yellow zone (IV) Unstable weak blue flame (V) Unstable
weak blue flame with yellow cap (VI) Unstable blue overventilated type

flame. However, only Type III flame (Va = 31.5 cm/s and Vf = 10.76 cm/
s, Va/Vf = 2.9) was investigated in detail by them. The schematic of the
Type  III  flame  shown  in  Fig.  5(a)  has  a  parabolic  blue  flame  at  the
bottom enveloped by an annular orange-yellow flame at the top. These
flame  portions  were  referred  to  as  blue  zone  and  orange-yellow  cap,
respectively.  The dark zone was  the  region  enveloped by  the orange-
yellow cap above the blue zone. Unfortunately, no visible photograph
of the Type III flame was provided in Ref. [42] for comparison with the
schematic flame profile in Fig. 5(a). In the present review, this schematic
flame  profile  reported  by  Wu  and  Essenhigh  is  compared  with  the
photograph  of  ethylene  IJDF  (Fig.  5(b))  observed  by  Sidebottom  and
Glassman  [76].  Although  the  air-fuel  jet  velocity  ratio  of  the  flame

shown in Fig. 5(b) is different from that of the schematic flame profile
depicted in Fig. 5(a), the existence of three flame zones, as reported by
Wu and Essenhigh [42] is evident in Fig. 5(b). A recent study by Wang
[77,80] compared the double blue zones in NJDF and IJDF as shown in
Fig. 5(c–e). The visualization indicated that spectral emissions of C2*,
CO2*, CH* and OH* in IJDF are three times higher as observed in NJDF
due to higher scalar dissipation rates in the IJDF. A comparison between
NJDF and IJDF shown in Fig. 5(c) indicates that the outer flame zone is
having an opening on the upper portion flame along the axis [80].The
effect  of  reaction  mechanism  on  OH*  chemiluminescence  was  exten-
sively discussed by Yan et al. [78] and Yang et al. [79]. The IJDF in their
study  was  characterized  based  on  OH*  chemiluminescence  which

formation of this double-flame structure in laminar IJDF shown in Fig. 5
(a) in terms of air-fuel velocity ratio. It can be observed that the central
air jet velocity for this flame is approximately three times higher than
that  of  the  annular  fuel  jet  velocity  (Fig.  5(a)).  Hence,  this  high  mo-
mentum central air jet is expected to effectively entrain and mix a part of
the low momentum fuel jet to form partially premixed reactants near the
flame base. The burning of this premixed air-fuel might be the reason for
the  blue  zone  closer  to  the  flame  base.  Furthermore,  the  part  of  the
annular fuel jet that has escaped the entrainment by the central air jet
might travel above the blue zone due to buoyancy-induced flow around
the flame. The diffusion of this escaped fuel with the ambient air and
their subsequent ignition by the hot products from the blue zone cause
formation  of  the  annular  orange-yellow  cap.  On  the  other  hand,  a
comparison between NJDF and IJDF as shown in Fig. 5(c) indicates the
outer flame zone is having an opening on the upper portion flame along
the axis [80]. The unfiltered CCD images exhibited a double blue zone
for both NJDF and IJDF [80] as shown in Fig. 5(d). The images with 515
nm band filter indicate distinct double blue zone (green in figure due to
change in image color), images with 430 nm also indicate double blue
zone whereas images with 455 nm and 310 nm have only one blue zone
corresponding to stoichiometric regions in IJDF. Fig. 5(e) indicates that
C2*,  CH*  are  located  in  fuel-rich  zone  which  makes  it  visibly  bluish
green whereas CO2* and OH* emissions are positioned at stoichiometric
zone. However, the flow field structure in and around the flame zone
must be investigated in detail to support this interpretation.

The  flame  structure  of  IJDF  is  closely  associated  with  the  air-fuel
mixing characteristics. The present literature on IJDF does not provide
a  concrete  study  on  air-fuel  mixing  quantification.  However,  many
studies provide a qualitative representation of partial premixing occur-
ring in IJDF. An unverified but exciting aspect of IJDF, claimed by many
researchers [21,70,81,82], especially for CoA IJDF configuration, is the
existence  of  air-fuel  partial  premixing  within  IJDF.  Enhanced  air-fuel
mixing  region,  referred  as  premixed  zone  was  identified  by  Mahesh
and  Mishra  [83]  using  the  CH*  chemiluminescence  signature  for  tur-
bulent LPG-air IJDF as seen in Fig. 6. Sobiesiak and Wenzell [21] used
color schlieren to visualize unmixed and rapid well mixed air-fuel re-
gions in turbulent natural gas air IJDF. The regions corresponding to the
well-mixed  areas  identified  from  schlieren  visualization  overlapped
with the peak temperature locations and were attributed to the partially
premixed zones within IJDF. However, attributing a well-mixed region
from  schlieren  visualization  to  a  partially  premixed  zone  in  IJDF  is
ambiguous  and  requires  further  investigation.  In  addition,  they
concluded  that  the  degree  of  partial  premixing  qualitatively  impacts
IJDF stability. The observations by Sobiesiak and Wenzell [21], Mahesh
and  Mishra  [83]  regarding  the  extent  of  the  partially  premixed  zone
occurring in IJDF needs to be investigated further and this remain an
open-ended question to the combustion community.

Recently,  Kapusta  and  co-workers  [81]  suggested  that  a  partially
premixed zone within turbulent IJDF could be identified by comparing
OH-PLIF, acetone PLIF and cold flow acetone PLIF images. However, the
above studies indicate the partially premixed zone in IJDF qualitatively
and lack quantitative representation in terms of local equivalence ratio
of these regions.

A  recent  investigation  by  Elbaz  and  Roberts  [46,85]  presented
high-speed OH-PLIF images of turbulent methane-air IJDF with varia-
tion in the central air jet Reynolds number. The OH-PLIF images of IJDF
with increasing air jet Reynolds number for a constant fuel flow rate are
depicted in Fig. 7. It can be observed that the annular OH ring broadens
and  merges  with  the  jet  centreline  due  to  reaction  zone  propagation,
indicating the formation of a well-mixed region for Vr = 20.7. Further-
more, for Vr > 49.8, the higher strain and turbulence intensity lead to the
breakdown of the inner OH layer, indicating the main flame extinction.

exhibits diffusion mode on both sides of the flame and and a combina-
tion of premixed and diffusion mode on the flame tip. Importantly, these
studies can help in understanding the extent of partial premixing in the
IJDF configuration from the chemiluminescence perspective.

In the present discussion, an attempt has been made to interpret the

species concentration profiles of a laminar methane IJDF were reported
by Wu and Essenhigh [42] as shown in Fig. 8. They related the species
concentration variation along the axial and radial directions of the flame
to the blue, orange-yellow cap and the dark zone boundaries. The con-
centration of 6 species (CH4, CO, CO2, N2, H2, and O2) were plotted at 12
locations along the flame axis without mentioning their respective un-
certainty level. The axial concentration profiles of all species excluding
CO  and  H2  obtained  from  experiments  were  compared  with  the  nu-
merical trends.

From the experimental and computational plots shown in Fig. 8, it
can  be  noted  that  the  oxygen  concentration  reached  zero  at  the  blue
zone tip, and no trace of it was found in the dark zone. Interestingly, the
height of the blue zone denoted by Hb, as shown in Fig. 8(a), coincided
with  the  height  where  the  centerline  oxygen  concentration  reached
almost a zero value [refer to Fig. 8(b and c)]. But, no trace of oxygen was
observed  in  the  dark  zone,  and  no  explanation  was  provided  for  this
interesting observation. In addition, the presence of 5 % CO and 4 % H2
concentrations in the dark zone were observed in the experimental re-
sults. Furthermore, the presence of 0.5 % H2  along the blue zone was
observed experimentally, which was attributed to the high diffusivity of
hydrogen.  The  axial  concentration  trends  of  CH4,  CO2,  N2,  and  O2
computed by the model matched satisfactorily with experimental pro-
files except for CO2 concentration level.

The radial concentration measurements in the flame were performed
at two axial locations, as shown in Fig. 8(b) and (c), respectively. It was
observed that the peak concentrations of N2, CO2, CO, and H2 coincided

with the flame surface at Z = 4.1 mm; hence, the blue zone boundary
could be characterized by the position of the peak concentration of these
species.  However,  at  Z  = 18.4  mm,  the  peak  concentration  of  these
species moved closer to the flame axis away from the dark zone - orange-
yellow cap boundary. Hence, the demarcation between the two flame
zones could not be identified with the peak concentration of these spe-
cies. This ambiguity in the precise separation of flame zone boundaries
when the peak concentration of species moved closer to the flame axis
needs to be addressed.

The experimental investigation of the OH, PAH, and soot distribution
studied by Mikofski et al. [86] provides some insight into the location of
OH, soot, and PAH layers in laminar IJDF. They reported the distribution
of OH-radical, PAH, and soot in laminar ethylene and methane IJDFs at
different air jet velocities for a constant fuel jet velocity. The location of
the reaction zone was mapped with the help of peak OH PLIF intensity in
the  flame  zone.  In  contrast  to  NJDF,  the  sooting  zone  in  IJDF  was
observed in the annular region sandwiched between inner OH and outer
PAH zones (Fig. 9(a)). Most importantly, the relative positions of OH,
PAH,  and  soot  layer  in  IJDF  and  NJDF, shown  in  Fig. 9(b),  exhibit  a
fundamental difference in flame structure between these two types of jet
diffusion flame.

To  summarize,  the  flame  structure  of  laminar  methane  IJDF  com-
prises three zones, namely (i) lower blue zone enveloped by (ii) orange-
yellow cap and (iii) dark zone [42]. The extent of the blue zone along the
centerline from the burner rim could be determined from the centerline
position  along  the  flow  direction,  where  almost  zero  oxygen

by Wu and Essenhigh [42], as shown in Fig. 10(a). Their results indi-
cated  a  steep  increase  in  centerline  gas  temperature  in  the  blue  zone
C/mm, which might  have resulted from the
with an increase of 500
higher level of partial premixing between air-fuel jets in this zone.

However, the centerline gas temperature showed a steep decline in
the dark zone, where the temperature decreased at the rate of 500
C/
cm, which  might be caused due to the radiation heat losses from the
flame  sheet  by  the  soot  particles  to  the  ambient  atmosphere.  Besides
these, the maximum centerline temperature was observed in the dark
zone with an offset of 3 mm from the blue zone tip, as shown in Fig. 10
(b).  Later  on,  Takagi  et  al.  [91]  made  a  comparative  study  between
laminar nitrogen diluted hydrogen JDF and IJDF both numerically and
experimentally.  The  numerical  simulation  incorporated  the  detailed
chemical  kinetics  and  thermal  diffusion  of  H2  and  H  species.  They
observed a higher flame tip temperature greater than the adiabatic flame
temperature in IJDF. In contrast, JDF exhibited a lower flame tip tem-
perature as compared to the adiabatic flame temperature, as shown in
Fig. 10(c), respectively. The reason for higher flame tip temperature in
IJDF  was  attributed  to  the  preferential  diffusion  of  heat  and  species,
which enhances the accumulation of excess enthalpy in the central part
of the flame zone.

In order to understand the flame structure of turbulent IJDF, reacting
flow simulation using probability density function (PDF) based mixture
fraction approach with equilibrium chemistry was performed by Mahesh
and Mishra [60]. The fuel jet velocity was kept constant at 0.56 m/s and
the air jet is maintained at 21.2 m/s in this simulation. The radial pro-
files of temperature and mass fractions of CH4, O2 and CO2 plotted axial
location (z = 30 mm) from the burner exit are shown in Fig. 11. The
temperature,  fuel  and  CO2  mass  fraction  profiles  display  peak  values
along the central air-fuel jet interface indicating the location of the flame
front. Besides this, oxygen mass fraction is found to reach zero along the
central air-fuel jet interface. Moreover, the broadening of the tempera-
ture, oxygen and product mass fraction profiles can be observed with an
increase in axial distance from the burner exit. In addition to this, the
fuel mass fraction is observed to reduce with an increase in axial dis-
tance from the burner exit indicating the consumption of fuel. As the fuel
jet  is  placed  between  the  central  air  jet  and  ambient  air  in  IJDF
configuration, the fuel mass fraction profile becomes zero at the central
air jet and ambient sides respectively. The flame structure of IJDF ob-
tained from the temperature and mass fraction profiles indicate that it is
distinct from the flame structure of normal jet diffusion flame which is
established with central fuel jet and annular air jet.

2.3. Flow-field characteristics in IJDF

The  streamline  data  obtained  from  the  PIV  measurements  on
ethylene-air IJDF by Shaddix and Williams [92] for the fuel flow rates of
1 slpm and 1.4 slpm for a fixed coflow air shown in Fig. 12 revealed that
the soot layer develops in the region where the flow starts to converge
towards the centreline  after maximum expansion.  The reason for this
observation is attributed to rich stoichiometry in this region which fa-
vours the growth and graphitization of soot precursor particles. How-
ever,  evidence of local equivalence ratio and temperature field is  not
provided  in  this  work  and  this  needs  to  be  explicitly  investigated  to
support the reason stated by the authors. Apart from this work, experi-
mental studies on laminar IJDF velocity field does not exist in literature
to  the best  of  the  authors’  knowledge and  there  is  a  need for further
detailed  studies  for  understanding  the  role  of  velocity  field  on  soot
formation in laminar IJDF.

The velocity field of transitional and turbulent methane IJDF with
the variation in central air jet velocity for a fixed fuel jet velocity was
experimentally investigated by Elbaz and Roberts [69] using simulta-
neous PIV and OH-PLIF measurements. Correlation of the velocity field
with  OH-PLIF  data  confirmed  that  impinging  of  high  velocity  air  jet
towards the flame neck results in high local strain rate resulting local
extinction of turbulent IJDF. However, correlation of the velocity field

concentration was observed. However, the reason for the formation of
different flame zones in laminar IJDF needs to be identified in order to
explain certain interesting observations reported by Wu and Essenhigh
[42], such as zero oxygen concentration in the dark zone, presence of H2
in the blue zone and offset in the position of peak centreline tempera-
ture. A recent numerical study by Demarco et al. [89,90] indicated the
overlap  of  maximum  centreline  temperature  with  complete  oxygen
consumption in a coflow ethylene IJDF. Furthermore, the flame struc-
ture of laminar ethylene IJDF and NJDF exhibited distinct differences in
the  positions  of  soot,  PAH,  and  OH  distribution  in  the  reaction  zone
[87]. However, the laminar IJDF structure based on the temperature,
species  concentration,  OH  radical,  PAH  and  soot  distributions  for
different hydrocarbon fuels has to be studied extensively to enhance the
existing knowledge on its flame structure.

The temperature distribution in the laminar IJDF can be helpful in
understanding  the  characteristics  of  the  three  different  zones.  In  this
regard,  the  axial  and  radial  temperature  distributions  of  laminar
methane IJDF at 7 mm axial and 12 mm radial locations were reported

with the locally reignited flame region after local extinction is lacking
presently  and  pursuing  research  in  that  direction  can  help  in  better
understanding of the stabilization aspect of IJDF in turbulent flow field.

3. Soot formation

The  sooting  characteristics  of  IJDF  differ  fundamentally  from  the
soot formation mechanism of NJDF. In IJDF, soot is formed along the
outer  periphery  of  the  reaction  front  and  does  not  cross  the  reaction
front to the oxidizer thus decoupling completely the soot oxidation from
the evolution process [90]. The series of steps involved in soot formation
in co-flowing JDFs are (1) fuel pyrolysis, (2) PAH growth, (3) particle
inception, (4) surface growth, (5) carbonization, (6) agglomeration and
(7)  oxidation.  In  the  case  of  NJDF,  soot  is  generally  formed  in  the
annular region through precursors such as PAH on the fuel-rich side of
the flame sheet. This incipient soot formed in the fuel-rich region re-
mains  in  this  zone  for  a  longer  time  resulting  in  enhanced  particle
growth followed by oxidation resulting in bigger soot particles. How-
ever, in IJDF, the soot formation strongly depends on the air and fuel jet

velocities. This is due to the fact that the incipient soot particles in the
fuel-rich  annular  region  are  carried  across  the  flame  sheet  by  the
high-velocity central air jet, which gives less residence time for the soot
particles to stay in the high-temperature flame zone and hence inhibits
their surface growth. As a result, soot formed in IJDF is mostly incipient
(young  soot);  hence,  the  total  mass  of  soot  generated  is  one  order  of
magnitude  lower  than  that  of  the  NJDF  [17].  This  reduction  in  the
amount  of  soot  production  makes  IJDF  configuration  distinct  from
normal  jet  diffusion  flame.  Furthermore,  the  soot  samples  from  IJDF
were studied by various techniques such as TEM (for soot morphology),
Elemental analysis (for C/H ratio), Thermal optical analysis (for organic
fraction), Laser microprobe mass spectroscopy, and Gas chromatogra-
phy/mass  spectroscopy  (for  analyzing  PAH  content)  by  Blevins  et  al.
[93]. They observed that the C/H ratio, organic fraction and PAH con-
tent exhibited characteristics of incipient soot.

Soot formation in flames is a health and environmental issue; how-
ever, soot is an unavoidable by-product in most practical combustion
applications. The preliminary numerical investigation of soot formation
in  laminar  normal  and  inverse  jet  diffusion  flame  was  carried  out  by

Their work was extended to study the effect of hydrogen addition on
overall  pollutant  emissions  which  included  soot  volume  of  inverse
diffusion flame. It was inferred that a small amount of hydrogen could
increase soot volume, whereas a large amount of H2 can reduce soot
levels. However, no information on reaction pathways are mentioned in
their  work.  The  factors  like  local  temperature,  species,  velocity,
vorticity, and strain rate are closely related and intertwined with soot
inception and evolution. The detailed analysis of such areas is pertinent
for effectively controlling soot emissions, which helps in the effective
design and development of high turbulent intensity burners.

A  recent  study  by  Guo  et  al.  [95]  investigated  the  effect  of  soot
inception models on PAHs. They concluded that temperature-dependent
collision  efficiency  along  with  radical  effects  can  provide  better  soot
predictions. The dilution effects on soot formation need to be studied in
detail due to its relevance from the industrial perspective. Some of the
relevant literature related to the effect on soot due to dilution effects are
discussed here. The enrichment of oxygen in oxidizer stream is used to
enhance thermal efficiency but this promotes both soot and PAH for-
mation in IJDF [90]. The increase in soot can be attributed to higher
temperatures that thermodynamically favour PAH formation [106,107].
Stelzner [108] reported that oxygen enrichment leads to high temper-
atures  and  higher  concentrations  of  radiating  species  (CO2,  H2O)  in
IJDF. Liu et al. [109] also reported that lowering the oxygen concen-
tration promoted soot formation in IJDF. Another study by Zhu et al.
[110] experimentally investigated the effect of CO and H2  in laminar
IJDF.  Escudero  et  al.  [111]  experimentally  investigated  the  effects  of
oxygen in an ethylene IJDF based on a normalized oxygen index (OI)
parameter. The radiant fraction of IJDF due to soot radiation was found
to be lower than NJDF for similar operating conditions implying ma-
jority of available energy is converted to sensible heat for heating the
burner  or  surrounding  gases.  Moreover,  the  radiation  loss along  with

Kaplan and Kailasanath [17], as discussed earlier in this review paper.
However,  soot  characterization  of  turbulent  IJDF  is  sparsely  studied
compared  to  its  laminar  IJDF  and  NJDF  counterpart  [56,90,94–105].
The soot characterization of a turbulent IJDF is practically relevant but
challenging  due  to  the  turbulence-combustion  coupling.  Moreover,  a
precise  measurement  with  spatial  and  temporal  follow-up  of  PAH
chemical pathways is required.

The  effect  of  hydrogen  addition  on  OH  distribution  of  LPG/Air
circumferential inverse diffusion flame was reported by Miao et al. [55].

soot volume fraction increased linearly with oxygen index [89] in IJDF.
Further,  Demarco  et  al.  [90]  studied  the  sooting  characteristics  for
ethylene laminar IJDF numerically and found that soot particles do not
cross  the  flame  front  to  oxidizer  front.  To  summarize,  the  literature
discussed in this section highlights that soot particles in IJDF undergoes
significant variations in thermal and chemical environments than NJDF.

3.1. Effect of velocity-ratio and pressure on soot formation

The flame aerodynamics immensely affects soot generation in IJDF
[104].  Katta  et  al.  [18,19]  performed  an  unsteady  simulation  with
detailed chemistry on ethylene IJDF in order to understand the cause of

soot  maturation  in  IJDF.  In  the  numerical  simulation,  they  observed
large toroidal vortices formed outside the flame surface and their growth
was found to be predominant downstream of the flame tip as compared
to NJDF. Furthermore, vortices were observed to entrain benzene which
was responsible for the formation of PAH in the flame (see Fig. 13). In
addition, nonparticipating particle of 20 nm diameter was injected along
the  1200  K  temperature  contour  to  predict  the  particle  trajectory  as
shown in Fig. 13(c). As most of the soot formation in diffusion flame
commenced  around  temperature  contour  of  1200  K  [19],  they  chose
1200 K contour for injecting the particles.

Interestingly, entrainment of injected particles with gaseous benzene
by the buoyancy-induced vortices outside the flame was evident from

the  simulation,  as  seen  in  Fig.  13(c).  They  speculated  that  the  soot
maturation process in IJDF might be due to the entrainment of primary
particles  by  the  vortices  formed  in  the  flame.  This  phenomenon  was
expected to increase the residence time of soot particles in the temper-
ature regime suitable for various processes such as surface coagulation
and surface growth. Recent research on laminar methane-air IJDF with
plasma-assisted  combustion  indicated  that  under  the  effect  of  plasma
discharge,  there  is an enhanced  amount of soot  on the  outer layer of
methane-air IJDF [112–115].

However, the observations are purely qualitative and needs exten-
sive investigation to understand the soot mechanism in plasma-assisted
IJDF  combustion  [116].  Through  numerical  simulations,  Kaplan  and
Kailasanath  [17]  investigated  the  sooting  characteristics  of  laminar
methane  IJDF  and  NJDF.  The  variation  of  soot  volume  fraction  and
residence time along the path line going through the maximum sooting
region in NJDF and IJDF is shown in Fig. 14. Their numerical results
indicated that the peak soot volume fraction in IJDF was in the order of
10(cid:0) 9 as compared to 10(cid:0) 7 for NJDF for the same air-fuel exit velocities
(see Fig. 14). They showed that surface growth rate of soot particles was
observed to be slower in IJDF than NJDF, which resulted in generation
of less amount of soot. On the other hand, for NJDF, increase in pressure
causes  flame  narrowing  due  to  enhanced  gas  density  [117–119].
Moreover with pressure a rise in PAH concentration was observed pro-
moting soot formation in NJDF displayed a power law relationship [120,
121].  Ying  and  Liu  [122]  studied  the  effects  of  n-butanol  doping  on
flame  morphology,  reactivity  and  nanostructure  of  soot  particles  at
different locations in ethylene JDF and IJDF. The study concluded that
the incipient soot particle size was smaller and less carbonized in IJDF as
compared to NJDF irrespective of doping [122].

Most  of  the  studies,  have  exhibited  that  PAH  adsorption  to  soot-
surface growth is enhanced with pressure [123–125] in NJDF. Howev-
er, very few literatures discuss about the effect of pressure in PAH for-
mation in IJDF. A recent study by Liu et al. [109] studied high pressure
IJDF  with  enriched  oxygen  in  the  oxidizer  stream.  This  study  high-
lighted the fact that increasing pressure promoted linear increase in PAH
formation and thereby resulted in enhanced soot formation which was
different from NJDF. Moreover, subdued oxygen content also promoted
soot formation in IJDF. In short, the literature discussed in this section
confirms that the soot particle properties and its morphology structure
are  interlinked  with  the  flame  configuration  and  relative  position  of
reactant delivery.

3.2. Incipient soot in laminar IJDF

Lee et al. [102] experimentally reported that IJDF configuration is
ideal for investigating incipient soot as soot particles do not experience
the  oxidation  process  significantly.  The  work  concluded  that  soot
inception was weakly dependent on temperature than fuel dilution. The
measurement  of  soot  formation  in  a  laminar  ethylene/air  IJDF  was
primarily reported by Makel et al. [126].

The evolution of soot in laminar ethene IJDF studied by Oh et al.
[127] from TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) images revealed
the presence of incipient soot particles of size ranging from 3 to 5 nm
closer to the burner exit. However, primary particle size was observed to
increase in diameter with an increase in flame height. They attributed
this observation to the surface growth process that takes place along the
particle  pathline  in  the  flame.  However,  the  soot  particle  diameter
remained constant beyond a certain distance from the burner exit, as
seen in Fig. 15(a).

Interestingly, the aggregate of soot particles exhibited an increase in
size  even  after  the  particle  growth  has  stopped.  The  cluster-cluster

aggregation by collisional growth was found to be the possible reason
behind this observation. The evolution of primary particles into aggre-
gates along the height of laminar IJDF is evident from the TEM images as
shown in Fig. 15(b). Jung et al. [128] studied the effect of incipient soot
particles in ethylene fuelled IJDF with oxygen enrichment. The oxygen
enrichment  caused  reduced  flame  height  pushing  the  soot  scattering
signal  towards  the  burner  tip.  Moreover,  C/H  ratios  increased  with
residence time with oxygen enrichment causing the incipient soot par-
ticles to reside in high temperature zones which get gradually carbon-
ized  which  is  different  from  NJDF.  The  TEM  images  for  this  IJDF
revealed that young soot have a larger clump of PAHs condensation and
surface growth. The accurate soot predictions play an indispensable role
in understanding the thermal effects. However, effect of soot radiation in
IJDF is covered sparingly in this review paper due to non-availability of
adequate literature. A notable work by Demarco et al. [89] as discussed
earlier, mentioned that optical-thin approximation is applicable to in-
verse diffusion flames. However, this approximation hinders the accu-
rate prediction of soot characteristics in such flames. The radiative heat
transfer is another aspect mentioned in their work which influences the
PAH  formation.  Radiative  heat  transfer  gets  enhanced  with  fuel  soot
propensity and adds additional hurdle for accurate predictions of soot
characteristics.  Furthermore,  they  concluded  that  Optically  Thin
Approximation (OTA) can be applied to IJDF soot radiation modelling
when  flame  optical  thickness  based  on  flame  radius  and  Plank  mean

absorption coefficient is less than 0.05.

3.3. Effect of equivalence ratio and Reynolds number on soot formation

Wu et al. [104] experimentally investigated the effect of Reynolds
number  and  gas  mole  ratio  between  actual  and  stoichiometric  condi-
tions,  [O/C]e  (or  indirectly  equivalence  ratio)  on  the  soot  emission
characteristics of methane-oxygen inverse diffusion flame using hyper-
spectral imaging. Their results indicated that the 2D soot emission in-
tensity  distribution  from  methane-oxygen  IDF  gets  reduced  with  an
increase in the [O/C]e as shown in Fig. 16. They attributed this effect to
the enhanced oxygen content which supports complete combustion of
fuel.

The effect of mean flow Reynolds number (Rem) on the axial soot
emission intensity of methane – oxygen IJDF was reported by Wu et al.
[104]. Here, the luminous flame height and region of soot emission is
observed  to  increase  monotonically  when  the  mean  flow  Reynolds
number is varied from 1400 to 3400 as evident from Fig. 17(a). More-
over, high soot radiation is observed in the mid portion of the visible
flame. Furthermore, the axial location of peak soot intensity is observed
to increase with Rem as shown in Fig. 17(b). However, the reasoning for
the observed trend in Fig. 17(a) and (b) was not provided in this paper. A
close observation reveals that gas mole ratio and mean flow Reynolds
number  are  related  parameters  and  it  is  not  possible  to  vary  one
parameter while keeping the other one fixed. Hence, further studies are
needed to explain the diametrically opposite observations as made in
Figs. 16 and 17(a and b).

In  another  experimental  study,  Li  et  al.  [129]  experimentally
investigated the effect of elevated stoichiometric mixture fraction (Zst)
on the structure and soot formation in CO2 diluted ethylene – oxygen
IDF  with  outer  annular  N2  coflow  using  Laser  Induced  Breakdown
Spectroscopy (LIBS). The results revealed that the annular axial location
of  the  soot  inception  point  in  laminar  IJDF  increases  with  Zst  (refer
Fig.  18).  In  addition,  the  width  of  the  sooting  zone  is  observed  to
decrease with an increase in Zst. Furthermore, they reported that the C/O
atomic ratio should be in the range of 0.5–0.6 for soot inception in IJDF
and An elevated Zst reduces the C/O atomic ratio which curtails the soot
formation.

fuel  flow  and  variable  air-jet  velocities  experimentally.  The  OH  PLIF
(Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence) mapping was utilized to visualize
the  stoichiometric  flame  height  of  IJDF.  From  their  observation,  the
stoichiometric flame height of ethylene IJDF was found to increase with
an increase in the air jet velocity for fixed fuel flow rate, as shown in
Fig.  19(a).  Interestingly,  the  HFV  of  methane  and  ethylene  IJDF  was
found  to  be  higher  than  the  HFS  as  seen  in  Figs.  19(b)  and  Fig.  9(c)
respectively.

Mikofski  et  al.  [130]  modified  the  original  Roper’s  formula  for
laminar  NJDF  [66]  to  calculate  the  stoichiometric  flame  height  of
laminar IJDF. The stoichiometric flame height of methane IJDF calcu-
lated from Roper’s formula showed good agreement with a flame height
estimated  from  OH  PLIF  measurements.  However,  the  predicted  stoi-
chiometric flame heights for ethylene IJDF from modified Roper’s cor-
relation had significant deviation from OH PLIF measured flame height.
The discussion on this modified Roper’s formula is provided in the next
section. Besides this, Kapusta [81] reported that the flame appearance of
IJDF remained similar for two different air nozzles at a similar equiva-
lence ratio (φ) and Reynolds number (Re). Therefore, they argued that φ
and Re should be considered instead of the air-fuel velocity ratio as a
global parameter to characterize the flame height of IJDF. However, this
claim needs to be verified for burners with different geometrical shapes
and sizes. Furthermore, the shear layer between the air and fuel stream,
which aids air-fuel mixing due to induced turbulence, cannot be char-
acterized using only Reair  and φ. Instead, the MFR and GMR are better
parameters in this context, which will be discussed elaborately. Mahesh
and Mishra [83] characterized the visible flame height of IJDF with a
new parameter, Global Momentum Ratio (GMR), which is the product of
the fuel-air velocity and overall equivalence ratio. The GMR correlated
well with the visible flame height for the backstep IJDF. However, the
validity of GMR needs to be tested, as the extent of partial premixing

diffuse into the oxidizer and react completely. The flame height is an
essential characteristic of non-premixed flames, which helps determine
the combustor length and validate the computational models. Further-
more, the flame height helps in estimating the residence time of soot
particles and hot products in the flame zone. According to Mikofski et al.
[130], the height of the flame perceived by the naked eye was defined as
the visible flame height.

The height of the flame from the burner exit to the point along the
centerline where φ = 1 is defined as the stoichiometric flame height [87,
130]. Different methods were adopted in the past by various researchers
for estimating the stoichiometric flame height, such as (i) Measurement
of maximum centerline peak blue intensity on the flame, (ii) Measure-
ment of peak centerline gas temperature, (iii) Measurement of centerline
gas concentration. Mikofski et al. [87,130] measured the stoichiometric
flame heights of laminar coaxial methane and ethylene IJDF at constant

varies for different IJDF configurations.

4.1. Flame height correlation

The  analytical  solution  for  the  estimation  of  stoichiometric  flame
height  in  coaxial  laminar  diffusion  flame  was  obtained  by  Burke-
Schumann [66,130–132]. In the Burke-Schumann analysis, only radial
diffusion of fuel and oxidizer was considered. Besides this, the mixing
between fuel and oxidizer was assumed to take place through diffusion
only  and  coefficient  of  inter-diffusion  between  fuel  and  oxidizer  was
kept constant in the analysis. Extending their work, Roper obtained a
correlation  for  predicting  the  laminar  jet  diffusion  flame  height  by
modifying  certain  assumptions  in  Burke-Schumann’s  analysis  and
compared with experiments. In the case of Burke-Schumann’s analytical
solution,  the  velocity  of  fuel  in  the  flame  region  was  assumed  to  be
constant and equal to the velocity at the burner exit. However, it could
be understood that the velocity of the fuel increases across the flame
zone  owing  to  the  buoyancy  forces.  Hence  considering  the  physical
nature of the problem, Roper [66,132] relaxed this assumption by taking
the fuel velocity parallel to the flame axis equal to the flame gas velocity
prevailing in the reaction zone. The flame gas velocity was obtained by
taking a momentum balance between the inlet reactants and combustion
products in the flame zone. For laminar coaxial normal diffusion flames,
the  stoichiometric  flame  height  given  by  Roper  [66,132]  is  provided

used in place of the stoichiometric air to fuel volume ratio in Roper’s
formula. Besides this, Roper [66,132] used a binary diffusion coefficient
between  air-nitrogen  at  the  ambient  temperature  of  293  K  in  their
analysis.  However,  Mikofski  et  al.  [130]  incorporated  the  average  of
flame  adiabatic  flame  temperature  and  inlet  temperature  of  fuel  for
determining the diffusion coefficient D’. Further, the Diffusion coeffi-
cient corresponded to the minimum of the binary diffusion coefficients
between  oxygen-nitrogen  and  fuel-nitrogen.  It  can  be  observed  from
Fig.  20  (a) and  (b)  that  the  predicted  (from  modified  Roper  model)
stoichiometric  flame  heights  of  laminar  ethylene  and  methane  IJDF
depend on the diffusion coefficients of fuel and air and are essential to
note that the predicted stoichiometric flame height is sensitive to the
temperature at which the diffusion coefficient is computed. Hence, the
modified Roper’s formula for predicting the stoichiometric flame height
in laminar IJDF has to be experimented with different fuels to check its
predicting capability.

The discussion above qualitatively represents the effect of air-flow
rate  on  flame  height.  The  impact  of  other  parameters  on  IJDF  flame
height is quantitatively expressed in certain correlations based on air-
fuel diameter and air-fuel velocity ratios obtained from open literature
and  listed  in  Table  3.  The  correlations  for  normalized  flame  height
depend on the air-fuel velocity, area, and fuel-air density ratios. Sobie-
siak and Wentzell [21] normalized the flame height for CoA IJDF using
air-jet tube diameter for an air-fuel velocity ratio (Vr) greater than five

but normalized Hf  with the fuel jet diameter for the rest of the cases.
However, this relation does not bring out the applicability of other pa-
rameters like the overall equivalence ratio (φ) or momentum flux ratio
(MFR). Mahesh and Mishra [84] reported that the flame height corre-
lates well with the air-fuel velocity ratio when normalized by df  for a
backstep burner and by da for a recessed IJDF burner. The difference in
the  normalizing  parameter  of  the  flame  height  can  be  attributed  to
variations  in  the  premixing  level  for  the  backstep  and  recessed  IJDF
burner. However, the effect of air-jet recession on the flame height is
negligible due to inadequate air-fuel partial premixing [83].

Table  3,  indicates  that  various  researchers  express  flame  height
correlations  in  multiple  parameters.  The  velocity  ratio  cannot  be
considered a global parameter to characterize flame height as it does not
incorporate the density of air/fuel species, subsequently cannot capture
the mixing mechanism. The Re and φ represent flow characteristics for
single stream flow. Apart from these parameters, only MR (Momentum
Ratio) describes the flow physics and qualitatively represents the air-fuel
mixing, which could govern the flame height variation under various
nozzle conditions.

Fig. 21(a) indicates a comparison study of flame height with velocity
ratio for CoA and Backstep IJDF [58,83]. This comparison study brings
out  a  very  interesting  observation  that  the  correlating  parameter  for
flame  height  based  on  velocity  ratio  is  erroneous  as  different  flame
height values are obtained for a same value of velocity ratio, as evident
from Fig. 21(a–c). This can be attributed to the inability to capture the
flow physics arising from air-fuel mixing at various air-fuel operating
conditions by velocity ratio. However, correlations based on MFR can
overcome the drawback of velocity ratio as the physics of flame height
variation relies on entrainment characteristics. Even though many re-
searchers attribute variation of flame height to the entrainment char-
acteristics,  proper  quantification  of  entrainment  is  necessary  to
understand these underlying physics. The flame height reduction in CAP
IJDF burners compared to CoA IJDF burners was due to the enhanced
entrainment and augmented ambient air-jet interactions [53].

An attempt has been made to compare the flame height correlations
for  different  CoA  IJDF  configurations  and  obtain  a  global  correlating
parameter  to  characterize  flame  height.  Table  3 indicates  that  flame
height is normalized with different parameters and correlating param-
eters for various CoA configurations. Lee et al. [44] and Wentzell [21,
43] have reported the semi-empirical correlations based on Vr, whereas
Mahesh and Mishra [134] have used MR as the correlation parameter. In
this review, the semi-empirical correlations reported are plotted based
on the MFR to compare the correlations on common grounds. The flame
height  increases  monotonously  with  fuel  jet  velocity  at  lower  MFR,
indicating the flame is in the diffusion mode of combustion, as shown in
Fig. 21 (b). This rearrangement of correlations based on MFR indicates
the  transition  from  diffusion-dominated  to  momentum  dominated
flame.  An  exponential  increase  of  flame  height
is  noted  for
diffusion-dominated flame (lower MFR), but flame height decreases and
remains
a
momentum-dominated  flame.  Moreover,  in  the  diffusion-dominated
flame,  the  air-fuel  mixing  is  less  intense,  dominated  by  buoyancy  ef-
fects due to Fr, which the MFR cannot dictate. A similar observation was
reported by Elbaz and Roberts [85] where a significant change in fuel
entrainment  and  mixing  led  to  a  change  in  flame  height  with  Vr  in
methane IJDF, as shown in Fig. 21(d).

Sobiesiak  and  Wenzell  [21]  investigated  the  flame  characteristics
and  structure  of  turbulent  IJDF  with  natural  gas  and  normalized  the
flame height based on the air-fuel velocity ratio. They concluded that the
inner air to fuel jet velocity ratio, fuel/air nozzle diameter  ratio, and
fuel/air jet equivalence ratio could be adequately optimized to improve
the uniform temperature region.

The IJDF  flame  height  is  the  net sum  of  the  base and  main  flame
height (Fig. 1). The fuel entrainment zone occurs within the base flame
region,  especially  when  the  central  air  jet  momentum  is  significantly
high [22,135]. The measure of entrainment of the fuel jet is character-
ized by base flame height. The base flame is termed the necking zone
[134],  entrainment  zone  [22,53],  and  pinched  flame  region  [44]  by

various researchers. A comparison study of base flame height with ve-
locity ratio (Va/Vf) for CoA and CAP burner is presented in Fig. 21(c).
The results indicate a steep decrease in base flame height with an in-
crease in air-jet velocity for methane CoA IJDF [22,133,134]. The CAP
burner with natural gas as the fuel displays a smaller base flame height
than the CoA burner, indicating that the port geometry profoundly im-
pacts base flame characteristics. The fuel-fuel jet interaction is promi-
nent when the annular fuel jet in CoA is distributed to smaller fuel ports,
which can initiate fuel-air mixing closer to the burner exit.

5. Flame stability

The  flame  stability  studies  can  help  to  identify  and  optimize  the
stability regimes in the Inverse jet diffusion flame configuration and aid
in estimating the operating range of the burner. A recent study indicated
that  burner  rim  geometry  and  incidence  angle  parameters  influenced
flame  stability  [136].  They  reported  that  the  flame  lift-off  velocity
increased with burner rim thickness. Moreover, the flame lift-off height
observed in the burner with a greater incidence angle was higher as the
radial shear velocity of the flame decreased for this case.

Song  et  al.  [136]  demonstrated  the  dependence  of  burner  rim
thickness and burner rim incidence angles on static flame stability for
the  inverse  jet  diffusion  flame.  The  flame  regimes  mentioned  in  the
study were attached flame, lift-off, and blowout regimes observed for a
fixed fuelling rate and at a constant air Reynolds number. Unlike lift-off
velocity, the blowout limit showed an inverse dependence on burner rim
thickness. However, the mechanisms related to the flame stability issues
were not described.

The IJDF behaves as a normal jet diffusion flame with increased fuel
jet velocity [60,84]. At a high fuel flow rate, the IJDF lifts off the burner
base and tends to be unstable. Hariharan and Mishra [137] extensively
studied flame stability characteristics for a circumferentially arranged
fuel  port  IJDF.  This  systematic  study  has  characterized  various  flame
stability regimes: stable flame zone, flame lift-off, local extinction and
ignition, and main flame extinction flame regime.

Another study by Xie et al. [138] experimentally investigated lift-off
characteristics  in  methane-oxygen  IJDF  with  the  aid  of  OH*  chem-
iluminescence. The study indicated that OH* signal peaks in the root of
the flame and main flame indicate two major reaction zones in a lifted
IJDF. The dominant reaction at the root of the flame is CH* + O2 =
OH*+CO (R1) due to increased presence of CH reactant and H + O + M
= OH*+M (R2) reaction is dominant at the main flame region due to the

increased presence of oxygen content.

5.1. Flame blow-off mechanism

The blow-off mechanism in IJDF  was investigated  by Mahesh and
Mishra [84] in a backstep LPG IJDF burner. The blow-off mechanism at
higher air jet velocity was attributed to a higher local strain rate at the
vicinity of the burner rim, leading to a leaner overall equivalence ratio
and higher heat dissipation. The tearing of base flame is another cause of
blowoff,  as  reported  in  this  study.  The  blow-off  mechanism  in  a  cir-
cumferentially  arranged  port  IJDF  burner  was  reported  by  Hariharan
and  Mishra  [50,137].  The  main  flame  extinction  was  identified  as  a
precursor  of  the  flame  blowoff  phenomenon  for  IJDF  configurations
which was depicted through high-speed imaging of base flame, as shown
in  Fig.  22.  The  local  attachment  and  detachment  of  base  flame,  to
counterbalance  the  local  flow  velocity  and  flame  propagation  speed.
Beyond a critical air flow rate, the base flame cannot sustain the higher
local strain rate due to greater heat dissipation rates leading to flame
blow-off [137].

5.2. Dynamic flame stability diagnosis in IJDF

The  real-time  flame  stability  diagnosis  help  understand  the  pre-
cursors of undesirable flame stability events like flame blow-off and lift-
off non-intrusively. The statistical analysis of CH* intensity variation on
the base flame of IJDF can detect such events. It is to be noted that the
base flame of IJDF is susceptible to undesirable flame stability events
like  flame  lift-off  phenomenon  and  flame  blowout.  Moreover,  the  ac-
quired  CH*  signals  exhibit  slowly  varying  trends  and  abrupt  changes
during  these  events.  Preliminary  work  on  the  diagnosis  of  dynamic
flame stability sensing was reported by Mahesh and Mishra [139] for a
CNG  inverse  jet  diffusion  flame.  They  utilized  the  Normalized  Root
Mean Square (NRMS) parameter, which physically indicates the devia-
tion from the normalized CH* value, as shown in Fig. 23. However, this
study was restricted to detecting the onset of blow-off. Further, sensing
the dynamic flame stability of IJDF in the CAP burner using a statistical
parameter called the coefficient of variation, as shown in Fig. 23(b) was
reported by Hariharan and Mishra [51].

The emission and thermal characteristics must be tracked closely to

a flame consisting of a laminar flame base and turbulent main flame. The
axial  temperature  profiles  and  NO,  NO2,  and  CO  emissions  were  re-
ported in this study. However, although they concluded a reduction in
NOx  characteristics and increased CO emissions with increased air-jet
velocity due to lower overall temperature, detailed thermal character-
istics were not reported in this study. Dong et al. [140,141] studied the
heat transfer characteristics of an impinging inverse diffusion flame jet
to identify a suitable Reynolds number range for impingement heating.
Fig.  24 indicates  the  temperature  contour  comprising  the  base  flame
zone,  mixing zone, reaction  zone, and  post-flame zone  as reported in
Ref. [141]. The potential core contained within the base flame zone is
attributed  to  the  low-temperature  cold  central  region.  However,  the
low-temperature  region  does  not  always  correspond  to  potential  core
and can exist in the regions of local extinction. A gradual temperature
increase is reported above the flame neck, attributed to air-fuel mixing
initiation.  This  cold  central  region  completely  disappears  within  the
reaction  zone,  and  subsequently,  complete  combustion  is  observed  at
the post-flame zone. The reaction zone in Fig. 24 exhibited a higher CO
concentration  in  the  base  flame  and  mixing  zones  due  to  fuel-rich
combustion.  They  reported  that  the  CO  gets  consumed  in  the
post-flame region due to the larger entrainment of ambient air, which
converts CO to CO2. Moreover, it was found that the heat transfer rate
(characterised by Nu) from the impinging IJDF is higher than that in the
premixed jet due to higher temperature at the post-flame zone [140],
enabling such configurations for industrial and domestic applications.
However,  these studies  need to be extended  to investigate post-flame
emission,  which  enables  these  configurations  for  wide  practical
applications.

Generally,  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)
database and other industry measurements of NOx  use emission index
(EI), in units of grams of NOx (as NO2) per kilogram of fuel. All NOx EIs
reported in this work are derived from the sum of the measured NO and
NO2 emission ratios and reported as grams of NO2 per kilogram [142].
Table 4 summarizes the EINOx  reported for different IJDF burner con-
figurations along with the maximum temperature. The increase in the
NO  emission  indices  is  due  to  increased  flame  temperature  and
enhanced air-fuel mixing. The maximum flame temperature reported is
for  the  backstep  IJDF  due  to  the  enhanced  air-fuel  premixing  level.
Hence, the burner geometry is pertinent in determining the flame tem-
perature  and  emission  characteristics.  The  literature  indicates  that
post-flame CO emissions were reported only by Ganguly et al. [133] for
CoA IJDF. Altogether, it can be noted that post-flame emissions, espe-
cially  CO  emissions,  need  to  be  studied  in  detail  for  the  design  and
development of low emission burners.

Zhen et al. [48] experimentally studied combustion characteristics
and noise pollution characteristics in short and long nozzle CAP burner

pitch  circle  radius  exhibited  higher  noise  radiation  but  lesser  NOx
emissions.

This was attributed to a higher heat release rate and higher flame
temperature. Also, a smaller central air jet da  results in a higher air jet
velocity, which enhances air-fuel mixing due to the low-pressure zone at
the  root  of  the  air  jet.  However,  these  studies  do  not  reveal  the  flow
physics of CAP burners and air-fuel mixing capabilities. Apart from these
investigations on CAP burners, the flame stability characteristics vary
drastically  with  increased  fuel  ports  due  to  enhanced  air-fuel  in-
teractions. Moreover, the limit of the number of fuel ports to optimize
CAP IJDF needs deeper investigation on entrainment characteristics.

Fig. 26 compares NO emission indices for recessed and unrecessed,
swirl,  backstep,  and  CoA  burner.  The  difference  in  EINOx  can  be
attributed  to the variation of fuel composition  and air-fuel premixing
level due to the difference in burner geometry. Sze et al. [143] experi-
mentally investigated the heat transfer characteristics of the IJDF with
circumferentially  arranged  fuel  ports.  They  studied  the  flame  charac-
teristics and effect of air velocity in co-axial diffusion flames (CoA) and
circumferentially arranged port (CAP) designs. The CAP and CoA show
bell-shaped  distribution  with  decreasing  EINOx  up  to  φ  = 3.  They
concluded that CAP exhibited intense mixing and lower NOx emissions,
attributed to the reburn mechanism of inner fuel-lean partially premixed
flame and outer diffusion flame. However, the evidence on the reburn
mechanism was not presented in this work. Moreover, they reported that
CAP designs unveiled an increase in EINOx  for a lower overall equiva-
lence ratio due to increased flame temperature and premixing capabil-
ities.  However,  these  observations  are  not  supported  by  quantitative
evidence.

Table  5 summarizes  the  post-flame  emissions  reported  for  CAP
burners  along  with  peak  temperature.  The  peak  temperature  remains
almost similar for all the reported CAP configurations. The increase in
EINOx  is  attributed  to  an  increase  in  flame  temperature.  At  a  higher
equivalence ratio greater than one, the NO formed within the partially
premixed  zone  burns  in  the  luminous  zone,  reducing  the  NO  formed
[49]. Zhen et al. [48] has reported EICO along the central jet line, as
shown in Table 5. The CO concentration increases with fuel jet velocity
and peaks out for φ = 1.6, beyond which it remains flat, burning in pure
diffusion mode of combustion.

The Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) measurements of thermal NO
emissions from laminar IJDF produced by a central air jet surrounded by
annular fuel-rich premixed Ethane-air flame was studied by Partridge
et al. [145]. The flame produced in this configuration is a kind of IJDF
that closely models the flame observed in staged air combustion. The NO
concentration  distribution  maps  indicated  that  the  NO  concentration
remained uniform in the region surrounded by fuel-rich premixed flame.
But it decreased in the region surrounded by the Argon curtain and in
the central region with an unreactive air jet. They also confirmed that a
higher  NO  concentration  occurs  at  the  tip  of  central  IJDF,  which  is
consistent with the observation in normal diffusion flames.

urations with the overall equivalence ratio.

flames. The centerline temperature in the short nozzle configuration was
higher in the inner reaction zone due to stronger and faster mixing in the
short nozzle flame. The CO emission is nearly zero in the base flame,
peaks out in the reaction zone, and decreases in the post-flame zone. The
decrease in the post-flame zone is attributed to dilution caused by the
entrained air and effective oxidation into CO2. These observations on CO
emission are in line with the emission studies of impinging IJDF carried
out by Dong et al. [140]. It was also noted that a higher noise level with a
long  nozzle  flame  was  due  to  increased  low-frequency  noise  due  to
substantial heat release rate fluctuations. Choy et al. [49] explored noise
and pollutant emission characteristics under open and impinging IJDFs
from five burners of different air-port diameters da and air-fuel spacing.
The NOx  emission characteristics at fixed pitch circle distance (S) and
varying air-port diameter da  and vice versa are plotted in Fig. 25. The
study was also extended to conclude the effects of variation in da, φ, and
H (nozzle to plate distance). The smaller air nozzle diameter and larger

7. Emerging applications

7.1. Nanomaterial synthesis

Jet diffusion flame configuration is extensively used for the synthesis
of different metal-oxide nanopowders which are utilized for the fabri-
cation of semiconductors and advanced ceramics [146,147]. The syn-
thesis  of  metal-oxide  nanoparticles  using  flame  reactor  is  a  simple
method compared to the wet chemistry processes and it can be scaled
easily  for  producing  commercial  quantities  of  silica,  titania,  and  tin
oxides  at  a  low  cost.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  size  and
morphology of the flame synthesized nanoparticles depend on various
factors  such  as  (i)  reactant  and  (ii)  precursor  delivery  mode  in  the
burner  (iii)  precursor  concentration  (iv)  oxygen  mole  fraction  in  the
oxidizer stream. The mode of delivering the reactants in the burner at
different velocities effectively modifies the flame temperature distribu-
tion and the flame length and hence the particle residence time within
the flame. Earlier Zhu and Pratsinis [146] compared the flame temper-
ature of normal and inverse jet diffusion flames in a triple port burner
used for the synthesis of silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide. In these
experiments, respective vapour precursors of SiO2 and TiO2 are carried
by inert gas argon which passes through the central port of the triple
port burner. The delivery of the precursor and the reactants in IJDF and
NJDF configurations are depicted in Fig. 27.

Zhu and Pratsinis [146] noticed two important aspects related to the
flame temperature distribution in IJDF and NJDF configurations which
affect the nanoparticle size. For the same flow rates of precursor and
reactants, maximum temperature of IJDF is found to be lower than that
of the NJDF with the variation in oxygen flow rate. In addition, location
of maximum flame temperature is offset from the center in the case of
IJDF as compared to the NJDF. The observed temperature distribution
accompanied by short flame length (particle residence time) in the IJDF
lead to less sintering rate of SiO2 and TiO2 that results in synthesis of
these oxide nanoparticles with small diameter as compared to the NJDF
configuration. In another study, Zhu and Pratsinis [146] reported that
titania  (TiO2)  nanoparticles  with  higher  BET  (Brunauer,  Emmett  and
Teller)  surface  area  can  be  synthesized  using  IJDF  configuration  as
compared to NJDF variant as shown in Fig. 28.

Panda et al. [148] observed that the oxygen and the inert flow rates
in  the  triple  port  burner  affect  the  temperature  distribution  of  IJDF
which  eventually  influences  the  particle  size  of  silica  nanopowders.
Sahoo and Mishra [149] demonstrated that the choice of fuel type in the
inverse jet diffusion flame affects the impurity content in the SiO2 syn-
thesis. The comparative study performed using CNG and pure H2 as fuel
revealed that the impurities in flame synthesized SiO2 nanoparticles can
be easily eliminated when CNG is replaced with Hydrogen fuel in IJDF
configuration.

It can be observed that the ambient oxygen enhancement resulted in
higher soot emission and luminosity of IJDF in microgravity environ-
ment as compared to the normal gravity [61]. This observation points to
increased fire hazard from IJDF in microgravity. Moreover, the flame
width  is  observed  to  increase  in  microgravity  with  ambient  oxygen
enhancement due to the absence of buoyant flow surrounding the flame.
In addition, microgravity IJDF is observed to reach steady state condi-
tions with short transient time as observed from Fig. 30 which helps in
probing IJDF global flame shape and thermochemical structure through
ground-based microgravity experiments.

Later  Krishnan  et  al.  [151]  predicted  the  flame  profiles/shapes  of
IJDF  with  variable  oxygen concentration  levels  in  normal and  micro-
gravity  conditions  using  Spalding  and  extended  Roper  models.  The
analytical model for flame profile prediction helps in scaling the heat
release  rates  and  soot  radiation  which  are  important  in  microgravity
conditions with respect  to fire hazard.  The results  (Fig. 31) indicated
that the flame profile prediction with extended Roper model compared
reasonably well with experiments as compared to the Spalding model.
Even though Spalding model predicted the flame heights reasonably, it
under predicted the flame width. The extended Roper model incorpo-
rated linear temperature profile along with accelerating velocity profile
at different axial locations for closely matching the predictions with the
experimental results.

8. Challenges and future prospects

• An extensive body of research on the soot formation characteristics
of laminar inverse jet diffusion flame exists in the literature. How-
ever,  the  mechanism  of  soot  formation  has  not  been  explored
adequately.  Besides  this,  the  effect  of  flow  modulation  such  as
acoustic excitation, fully modulated flow through a solenoid valve,
and the role of microgravity and sub-atmospheric pressures on the
soot formation aspects of IJDF has not been investigated to the best
of  the  author’s  knowledge.  Such  studies  can  help  to  enhance  the
fundamental knowledge for soot control in inverse jet flame-based
combustion systems.

• There is a need for generating extensive database on temperature,
species  concentration  distribution  and  soot  volume  fraction  in
laminar IJDF for well-defined inlet conditions like Tu-Delft, Adelaide
Jet Flame configuration using time resolved ultra-high speed laser
diagnostics for developing accurate chemical mechanism and vali-
dating numerical codes.

• The semi-empirical  correlations  for flame  stability  limits based  on
the momentum flux ratio of air-fuel jets, and other scaling laws need
to be developed as it will be helpful in the design and development of
IJDF-based combustion devices.

• It has been observed that only very few fuels have been investigated
in  this  flame  configuration.  Hence  experiments  with  different  hy-
drocarbon  fuels,  ammonia  and  hydrogen  are  required  for  better
understanding of the characteristics of laminar and turbulent IJDF.
• In  the  case  of  laminar  IJDF,  there  is  an  ambiguity  regarding  the
mismatch  between  the  visible  and  stoichiometric  flame  heights  as
predicted from the correlation, which requires further investigation.
• The  existence  of  double  flame  structure  in  laminar  IJDF  has  been
conjectured through indirect measurements such as centerline tem-
perature and oxygen concentration. The mechanism for the forma-
tion of double flame structure in laminar and turbulent IJDF through
PIV and PLIF techniques needs to be explored.

• Understanding of fundamental issues such as turbulence – chemistry
interaction, soot-turbulence interaction, and description of detailed
chemical kinetics in the case of turbulent IJDF is lacking and needs
further attention in the future.

• It  is  well  known  that  Poly  Aromatic  Hydrocarbons  (PAH)  are  the
building blocks of incipient or early soot [93] and gas phase PAH also
contribute to the growth of soot size by attaching to the outer surface

7.2. Microgravity inverse jet diffusion flames

Research on IJDF under microgravity conditions is reviewed in this
section. These studies focused mainly on the luminous flame height and
global flame shape of laminar IJDF in microgravity environment. The
studies on laminar flames under microgravity provide a simple model to
understand  complex  turbulent  flames  [150,151].  In  addition,  these
studies also provide valuable information with regard to crew fire safety
in microgravity environment which are crucial for long duration space
explorations [150].

The first experimental study on ethane free jet IJDF in microgravity
investigated  the  effect  of  oxygen  enhanced  ambient  conditions  on  its
luminous flame height and visible flame shape. The microgravity con-
ditions were simulated in the drop tower for 2.2 s [61]. The comparison
between visible appearance of IJDF in normal and microgravity condi-
tions  is  shown  in  Fig.  29.  The  100i  label  in  Fig.  29 denotes  ambient
oxygen mole fraction (XO2) of 1 whereas 21i label corresponds to XO2 =

of soot. The modelling of gas phase PAH leading to the formation of
incipient soot is important and essential for understanding the evo-
lution and control of soot particles from combustion systems. Vali-
dation of soot inception models require that the samples of incipient
soot be collected through intrusive probes from the normal diffusion
flames  through dedicated measurements. However, physical intru-
sion of the probe into the flame disturbs the flow field and alters it. In
contrast, Inverse Diffusion Flame (IJDF) is one such unique diffusion
flame configuration, which due to its fuel-oxidizer port arrangement
and velocity ratio, is suitable for extracting incipient soot from the
periphery of the flame envelope without any physical intrusion to it.
It is due to fact that in IJDF, oxidizer jet is surrounded by fuel jet and
hence, soot is formed on the annular fuel side which gets convected
axially along the flame edge without passing through the flame tip
[93]. Hence it does not undergo carbonization and oxidation as in
the case of normal diffusion flame (NJDF), rather remains as incip-
ient soot being swayed away as the exhaust. Because of the advan-
tage of extracting large quantities of incipient soot without invading
the flame, IJDF configuration can be utilized as a model flame for
understanding the early stages of soot formation and subsequently
develop more realistic and robust soot inception models.

• It has been observed that GMR and MFR are better correlating pa-
rameters for the visible flame height of turbulent IJDF. However, the
efficacy of this correlation needs to be tested further with different
kinds of hydrocarbon and other fuels.

• The blow-off mechanism of turbulent IJDF is presently unclear from
the reported research, which needs further relook to understand the
stability aspects of IJDF better. Developing a proper correlation for
predicting blowout limits over a wide operating range is essential for
designing and developing IJDF based combustion systems.

• The emission characteristics of both laminar and turbulent IJDF with
respect  to  unburnt  hydrocarbon  and  carbon  monoxide  is  less
explored and needs extensive research.

• An extensive experimental effort must be undertaken to understand
the  IJDF  flame  structure  in  in  terms  of  temperature  and  species
concentration  profiles  using  advanced  nonintrusive  diagnostic
techniques. As discussed in this paper, the validation studies of some
simple IJDF arrangements that explain the cold and hot flow patterns
using  PIV  and  PLIF  pave  the  foundation  for  understanding  IJDF
structure in more detail. Parallely, extensive numerical simulations
can  divulge  more  insights  into  the  flame  structure  of  IJDF,  which
needs to be pursued.

• Optimizing the fuel ports and the bluff body spacing/sizing in CAP
burners  can  impact  the  recirculation  zone.  Such  aspects  help  to
comprehend  the  flame  stability  and  anchoring  capabilities  of  cir-
cumferentially  arranged  fuel  port  stabilized  inverse  jet  diffusion
flame configurations.

• The aspect ratio variation of the central port in IJDF burners impacts
the flow dynamics in the flame. Proper optimization of the aspect
ratio of central air-port in IJDF burners needs to be investigated to
achieve  better  flame  characteristics.  Moreover,  other  asymmetric
central  air  ports  like  square  or  triangular  shapes  in  various  IJDF
burners  can  be  explored  further  to  enhance  air-fuel  mixing  effec-
tiveness in IJDF based combustion systems.

9. Concluding remarks

In  this  paper,  the  characteristics  of  laminar  and  turbulent  Inverse
Diffusion Flame (IJDF) based on visible flame appearance, flame height,
species and temperature distribution, soot formation, flame stability and
emission characteristics have been reviewed extensively. In the case of
laminar IJDF, six different flame types have been identified based on
visible appearance and air-fuel velocity ratio. However, the literature
reported  a  detailed  investigation  only  for  one  flame  type,  i.e.,  the
laminar blue flame with yellow soot cap (Type III flame). Furthermore,
the  reason  for  the  existence  of  three  different  zones,  namely  blue,

22

orange–yellow cap, and dark zones in the Type III laminar IJDF, remains
unexplored. The centreline gas temperature and oxygen concentration
profiles  indicate the  possible  existence  of  a  double  flame  structure in
laminar IJDF, which needs to be confirmed. The flame height of laminar
IJDF corresponding to the centreline peak OH intensity (stoichiometric)
is found to be shorter than the flame height obtained from the position of
peak  flame  luminosity.  Besides  this,  the  stoichiometric  flame  height
estimation in laminar IJDF using the modified Roper’s correlation calls
for further investigation as it is observed to be sensitive to the choice of
diffusion coefficient. The numerical simulations predicted the reduction
in the soot volume fraction of laminar IJDF to be almost one order of
magnitude than that of the normal jet diffusion flame (NJDF) for the
same air-fuel velocity ratio. In addition, the experimental studies on the
soot  formation  mechanism  of  laminar  IJDF  reveal  the  existence  of
incipient soot in the exhaust. The NOX emissions from the laminar IJDF
in a staged air burner indicate that maximum NO concentration occurs
at the IJDF tip, whose mechanism is yet to be understood. Moreover,
similar emission characteristics have not been reported in laminar IJDF
with different fuels and burners, which need to be investigated.

The port arrangement and the relative momentum between fuel and
air  jets  profoundly  influence  the  turbulent  inverse  jet  diffusion  flame
characteristics. However, the distinct peculiarities  between NJDF and
IJDF characteristics based on the air-fuel momentum ratio has not been
reported in literature due to the unavailability of appropriate similarity
parameters  for  their  comparison.  Nevertheless,  it  is  clear  that  the
aerodynamics  of  air-fuel  jets  and  their  relative  position  of  injection
partly accounts for the differences in IJDF characteristics as compared to
the NJDF configuration. However, the fluid dynamics aspects such as
entrainment,  mixing  quantification  of  coaxial  jets  with  high  inner  to
outer  fluid  density  ratio  and  high  outer  to  inner  jet  momentum  ratio
need to be investigated in future in order to appreciate the differences in
the characteristics of IJDF and NJDF. The formation of the necking zone
in the case of turbulent IJDF have a consequence on its flame stability.
The non-intrusive real-time flame stability diagnosis of turbulent IJDF
help understand the precursors of undesirable flame stability events like
flame blow-off and lift-off with temporal sensitivity. An increase in the
air-fuel momentum ratio has been observed to result in the formation of
the necking zone in turbulent IJDF. The fluid dynamics near the necking
zone can help to understand the blowout mechanism in turbulent IJDF.
The flame luminosity and the visible flame height of turbulent IJDF get
reduced considerably with an increase in the air-fuel momentum ratio.
The  Global  Momentum  Ratio  and  MFR  appears  to  be  an  appropriate
correlating  parameter  for  the  visible  flame  height  of  turbulent  IJDF.
However, there is a need for acquiring more extensive data on the cor-
relation of visual flame height of different fuels with GMR and MFR to
extend  its  range  of  applications.  Previous  research  indicates  IJDF  ap-
pears to be partially premixed flame at a higher airfuel momentum ratio.
However,  this  remains  an  open-ended  question  which  needs  to  be
addressed.  Flame  impingement  heating  and  large-scale  metal-oxide
nano  powder  synthesis  prefer  IJDF  configuration  due  to  its  unique
temperature  distribution  and  thermo-chemical  structure.  However,
there is a need for more systematic studies to optimize the IJDF char-
acteristics  for  realizing  (i)  flame  impingement  heating  with  desired
uniform temperature distribution using minimum power level and (ii)
large yield of nanopowders with desired particle size and morphology
through flame synthesis.
