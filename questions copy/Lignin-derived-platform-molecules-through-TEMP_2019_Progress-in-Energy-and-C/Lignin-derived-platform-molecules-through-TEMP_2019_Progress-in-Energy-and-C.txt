Lignin is currently an under-used material of the pulping and cellulosic ethanol production plants. The
first and foremost objective in dealing with lignin is to augment the use of this aromatic compound
and financial profitability of lignin-based processes. Of particular interests are lignin oxidation and de-
polymerization methods that harvest either the aromatic subunits of polymers or monomeric/oligomeric
aromatic products used as platform chemicals. In this context, many studies have focused on the catalytic
processes in which a nitroxyl catalyst, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), was employed to ox-
idize hydroxyl groups in lignin structure and selectively depolymerize lignin via cleavage of the ether and
C –C bonds. In discussing the advanced studies especially over the last decade on the oxidation of lignin
models with TEMPO catalyst systems, this review provides a description of promising methods that can
be employed for authentic lignin conversion. In the present review, a particular emphasis is dedicated to
the proposed mechanisms for the oxidation of lignin and lignin models.

1. Introduction

main section then discusses the challenges and prospective aspects
of lignin functionalization and depolymerization.

Lignocellulosic biomass, an important resource for the produc-
tion of fuels, materials and chemicals, comes from wood and non-
wood  species  and  consists  of  three  main  components:  cellulose,
hemicelluloses and lignin ( Fig. 1 ). Lignin is a three-dimensional hy-
drophobic  polymer  that  acts  as  glue,  binding  different  layers  of
cell  wall  of  biomass  [1,2] .  It  is  one  of  the  important  sources  of
aromatic  compounds  in  nature  and  a  by-product  of  the  pulping
industry,  representing  an  excellent  alternative  feedstock  for  sus-
tainable product development [3,4] . Annually, more than 50 mil-
lion tons of lignin are produced in the pulping industry [5] . The
current  utilization  of  lignin  is  limited  in  that  only  about  2–5%
of  lignin  is  commercially  used  for  producing  fillers  [6] ,  binders
[7] and dispersing agents [8] . The rest is either burned for energy
or treated in wastewater [9,10] . Recent economic studies have re-
ported that effective routes for lignin valorization would result in 5
times more value compared with burning it for energy production
[11,12] .

Lignin  has  an  amorphous,  complex  and  robust  structure.  The
adverse  effect  of  such  complexity  is  apparent  in  the  low  chem-
ical  reactivity  of  lignin,  which  hampers  its  conversion  to  value
added products [13] . Various pathways, such as pyrolysis, reduction
and oxidation, have been employed for lignin valorization, yield-
ing value added chemicals [14–23] . Among these methods, the ox-
idation of lignin has attracted considerable interest as a promising
method to form polyfunctional aromatic compounds [24–27] .

Oxidation  can  be  performed  with  a  variety  of  oxidants,  such
as bleaching agents (e.g. chlorine, chlorine dioxide, hypochlorite),
H
2 is highly desirable because it
is inexpensive and no toxic byproducts are generated from the oxi-
dizing agent itself [33,34] . However, it is kinetically unyielding. Uti-
lizing an economical and effective method that can be employed
under mild condition to produce desirable products is one of the
greatest  challenges  in  oxidation  processes.  In  this  circumstance,
most of studies were dedicated to the selective catalytic oxidation
of lignin.

Recently,  2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl  (TEMPO)  cat-
alyzed oxidation processes generated promising interesting lignin
oxidation results. However, the available review papers on lignin
oxidation do not provide detailed studies on TEMPO oxidation of
lignin  [23 , 35–39] ,  which  is  the  focus  of  the  present  work.  Here,
we aim to offer a detailed analysis regarding the TEMPO oxidation
of  lignin,  which  covers  the  modification  of  technical  lignin  and
lignin model compounds. The progress achieved on oxidation and
depolymerization  of  lignin  into  valuable  chemicals  and  fuels  is
covered  in  this  review  article.  It  is  notable  that  a  summary  of
lignin  structure,  technical  lignin  isolation  methods  and  TEMPO
reactivity is provided in the beginning of this review paper. The

2. Lignin structure

2.1. Dilignols, monolignols and linkages

The  present  section  provides  an  overview  of  lignin  struc-
tures and models. Complexity of lignin structure comes from the
linkages  formed  between  the  building  units  of  lignin.  From  the
chemistry  standpoint,  lignin  is  produced  through  the  enzyme-
mediated dehydrogenative polymerization of the phenylpropanolic
units namely, synapyl (3,5-dimethoxy 4-hydroxycinnamyl) alcohol,
coniferyl (3-methoxy 4-hydroxycinnamyl) alcohol and p -coumaryl
(4-hydroxycinnamyl) alcohol which form the syringyl (S), guaiacyl
(G), and hydroxyphenyl (H) lignin subunits, respectively ( Fig. 2 (a))
[40–45] . Softwood lignin is predominately G type (90 −95%), while
hardwood  lignin  is  mostly  G  and  S  types  [46–50] .  These  sub-
units  can  be  manipulated  to  alter  the  lignin  degradation  [51] .
The subunits are linked by ether and C –C bonds where the com-
mon interunit linkages are generally seen at the β-position of the
monolignol  species,  arylglycerol- β-aryl  ethers  ( β–O–4),  phenyl-
coumarans ( β–5), pinoresinols ( β–β), and diphenylethane dimers
( β–1) [52] . Dilignols and higher oligomers preferentially couple at
the 4 and 5 positions, yielding diaryl ethers (4–O–5) and biphenyls
(5–5) (see Fig. 2 (b)) [11,37,53] . The 4–O–5 linkages bear ether func-
tionalities while the β–5, β–β, 5–5 and β–1 linkages connect two
monolignols via a C –C bond. Of the lignin linkages, the most abun-
dant is the β–O–4 [54] which corresponds to a bond formed be-
tween  the  β carbon  of  the  aliphatic  side  chain  and  the  oxygen
atom attached to the C
4 position of the aromatic moiety [26] . The
occurrence values (%) for a range of lignin linkages are presented
in Fig. 2 (b) [46,55] .

2.2. Bond distances and dissociation energy

Understanding the properties, such as bond distances and bond
dissociation energies, of various linkages in lignin is essential for
estimation  of  lignin  resistance  toward  depolymerization.  Density
functional  theory  (DFT),  a  quantum  chemical  approach,  can  be
used to predict the bond dissociation energies and reactivity trends
[57] . Table 1 presents the bond distances and bond dissociation en-
ergies for lignin model compound linkages. In general, the ether
bond linkages are shorter than the C –C bond linkages, and 4–O–5
is the shortest one. Calculations reveal that the β–5 and 5–5 link-
ages are among the strongest bonds. The presence of substituents
on the arene rings tends to make the ether linkages weaker. The
bond dissociation energy (BDE) calculations suggests that the pres-
ence  of  carbonyl  group  at  the  C α position  and  ortho-methoxy

substitutions in the arene ring results in a lower BDE for the β–
O–4 linkages, but a negligible effect on the BDEs of C –C bond link-
ages [58] . Moreover, oxidation of either the primary or secondary
alcohol  in  the  β–O–4  lignin  model  decreases  the  average  BDEs.
Lignin models with ketone forms have lower BDE than do the alde-
hyde forms, which is attributed to the delocalization of the result-
ing radicals into the carbonyl and the aromatic ring for the ketone
[59] .

3. Industrial lignins

The properties of lignin, which are affected by the pulping con-
ditions and wood species, alter their targeted applications [60] . In
addition, the composition, solubility and molecular weight of lignin
differ  depending  on  the  isolation  process  of  lignin  from  pulping
spent liquors. Lignin with a high molecular weight is desirable to

be used as an adhesive and binder, whereas low molecular weight
lignin is attractive for phenol or aromatic chemical production [33] .
Most abundant industrial lignin is currently produced in kraft
pulping process and is generally recovered by acidification of black
liquor [61] . Recently, LignoBoost, which is commercialized by Dom-
tar in North Carolina, and LignoForce, which is commercialized by
WestFraser in Alberta, were designed according to the acidification
concept to isolate kraft lignin from black liquor [13 , 62–64] . Acid-
ification of the alkali black liquor protonates the phenoxy groups,
affording phenolic, water insoluble kraft lignin [65,66] . Main char-
acteristics and impurity contents of kraft lignin along with other
industrial lignins are presented in Table 2 .

Currently, the majority of kraft lignin is burned in the recovery
boiler to produce energy for the process [67] . Major non-fuel uti-
lization of kraft lignin includes its modification to produce lignin
based dispersants, lignin based thermoset plastic, resin, and carbon

fibers [68] . These products are mainly produced via sulfomethy-
lation  or  amination  following  the  Mannich  type  reaction.  Today,
WestRock and Domtar are the main producers of lignin derivatives
and kraft lignin worldwide [69] . Their products are mainly known
by commercial names of Indulin series, Polyfon series, kraftsperse
series and Reax series, and the BioChoice lignin [24,70] .

Lignosulfonates (LS) are produced at the rate of 1 million tons
annually  [71] .  LS  are  amphiphilic  and  water-soluble  lignins  in
forms of  metal or  ammonium salts. The  introduction of sulfonic
acids and cleavage of bonds at propane chains in sulfite pulping
process  degrade  lignin  into  smaller  fractions  and  make  it  water
soluble [72] . However, C α and C
6 positions in lignin structures in-
crease  the  molecular  weight  of  lignosulfonate  under  acid  sulfite
pulping conditions [73] . LS has a relatively high molecular weight
(10 0 0–150,0 0 0 g/mol) and high ash content ( Table 2 ), and is used
as a surfactant, dispersant and binder at industrial scales [74,75] .
LS can be oxidized to produce vanillin, or chemically modified by
carboxylation,  amination,  and  graft  copolymerization  to  produce
miscellaneous products [11,76] . The largest producer of LS is Bor-
regaard  Ligno  Tech.  Tembec,  La  Rochette  Venizel,  Nippon  Paper
Chemicals, Cartiere Burgo and Domsjo Fabriker AB are also impor-
tant lignosulfonate producers [57,77] .

Similar to kraft lignin, soda lignin has a hydrophobic character-
istic. Soda lignin is produced via soda or soda anthraquinone pulp-
ing processes. Unlike kraft lignin, soda lignin is sulfur free. Total
hydroxyl groups content in soda lignin is reported to be around
0.8–0.9  per  phenyl  propane  unit,  equally  split  between  aliphatic
and phenolic hydroxyl groups ( Table 2 ). Soda lignin is suitable for
animal feed and nutrition applications as well as binding applica-
tion. High purity soda lignins are mainly produced by GreenValue
SA company [78] . Unpurified soda lignins are offered by Northway
Lignin Chemical company in 50 wt% liquid form, which are used as
a low end binder [79] .

A  pulping  medium  containing  a  mixture  of  organic  solvent,
such  as  ethanol,  methanol,  or  acetone,  with  water  is  used  to
produce  the  Organosolv  lignin  (OL)  [80] .  Lignin  retains  much
of  its  original  native  structure  in  the  form  of  β–O–4  inter-unit
linkages,  but  it  contains  some  condensed  structures  [81,82] .  OL
products are usually pure with low carbohydrate contents due to
the  hydrolysis  of  ether  bonds  that  links  lignin to  hemicelluloses
[83] .  Compared  to  kraft  pulping  process,  the  organosolv  method
has lower environmental impacts due to the absence of sulfur in
the pulping process [84] . Being highly hydrophobic, OL is insoluble
in  water,  but  soluble  in  dilute  aqueous  alkaline  and  many  polar
organic solvents such as methanol and ethanol. The lower molecu-
lar weight and high chemical purity (sulfur free compound) make
OL attractive as a source of low molecular weight compounds for
phenol or aromatic chemical production [81,85] . The high cost of
organosolv process [86] , which is due to the complexity of solvent
recovery  process  [57] ,  hampers  the  expansion  of  the  process  at

a commercial scale. The most common organosolv processes are
Alcell  process,  using  ethanol/water  as  a  solvent,  and  Acetosolv
process, which uses acetic acid combined with a small amount of
mineral acid, e.g., HCl, as solvent [79,80] .

Acid and enzymatic hydrolysis are two methods to produce the
hydrolysis lignin (HL). Diluted or  concentrated acids are used in
acid hydrolysis process, where both of them have drawbacks, e.g.,
high temperature and pressure requirements in the hydrolysis pro-
cess and low recovery yield of lignin in the dilute acid hydrolysis
process and acid recovery process in the concentrated acid hydrol-
ysis method. The abovementioned obstacles have limited the use
of acid hydrolysis (AH) processes. Unlike the AH process, enzyme
hydrolysis (EH) process has attracted more interest. EH lignin has
high  chemical  reactivity,  which  makes  it  a  favorable  additive  in
polymer preparations [87] . The glass transition temperature of HL
is  lower  than  that  of  other  lignins.  This  could  be  attributed  to
the  presence  of  high  amounts  of  carbohydrates  in  HL  ( Table  2 ),
which in turn increases the amount of retained water molecules
in  the  lignin  structure  [88] .  The  hydrolysis  lignin  has  been  pro-
duced in both pilot and industrial scales. HL is insoluble in polar
organic solvents and alkaline solutions due to the strong conden-
sation/polymerization occurring in the hydrolysis route [84] .

4. Lignin valorization strategies

As mentioned earlier, different strategies, e.g., pyrolysis, oxida-
tion and hydroprocessing, are performed for catalytic transforma-
tion of lignin into value added products. Although the scope of the
present review is limited to oxidation processes, a brief explana-
tion  of  the  methods  is  presented  in  this  section  to  provide  the
reader with insights into these key processes.

4.1. Pyrolysis

6 , and CO

Pyrolysis,  a  thermochemical  process,  is  a  rapid  heating  of
feedstock  at  high  temperature  (450–600  °C)  often  under  oxygen
free  environment  to  produce  small  fragments  [26,94] .  Various
products  can  be  generated  in  primary  stage  (20 0–40 0  °C)  and
secondary stage (40 0–70 0 °C) of pyrolysis. A mixture of gases (e.g.,
2 ), volatile liquids (e.g., methanol, acetone,
H
and acetaldehyde), monomers (e.g., phenol, guaiacol, syringol) and
char are formed in the pyrolysis of lignin [95] . The compositions
of  products  are  strongly  affected  by  lignin  type.  For  example,
hardwood  lignin  having  more  methoxy  group  in  syringyl  units
4 and char compared to softwood
affords a higher yield of CO
lignin [50] . Presence of a catalyst during the pyrolysis reaction is
favorable  with  respect  to  the  yield  and  distribution  of  products.
Catalysts  not  only  facilitate  the  conversion  of  depolymerized
intermediates  into  valuable  compounds,  but  also  favor  less  char
production by preventing the repolymerization and condensation

of intermediate products. Ma et al. [96] studied the role of pore
structure  and  acid  sites  of  zeolites  in  fast  pyrolysis  of  lignin.
They showed that the larger molecules can be stabilized through
adsorption on large pores of the catalyst and further converted to
desired products [97] .

Although pyrolysis seems a simple method for lignin depoly-
merization, several drawbacks hinder its application. For example,
formation of char having limited functional groups is an obstacle
for further utilization of char in various applications, e.g., pollutant
adsorption and energy storage devices [95] .

4.2. Hydroprocessing

Lignin  depolymerization  through  hydroprocessing  has  been
vastly studied over the last few years [97–101] . There are various
hydroprocessing  reactions  such  as,  hydrogenolysis,  hydrodeoxy-
genation  and  hydrogenation.  Hydrogenolysis  involves  cleavage  of
a single bond and is an important reaction for lignin depolymer-
ization, particularly in cleaving of C –O bonds [23] . Hydrogenation
2 across an unsaturated C = C or C = O bond, and hydrodeox-
adds H
genation  often  involves  alcohol  dehydration  followed  by  hydro-
genation. One of the important issues in lignin upgrading through
reduction  is  hydrogenation  of  benzene  rings  yielding  fully  satu-
rated products, which do not readily undergo further hydrogenoly-
sis [98] . Moreover, hydrogen consumption management should be
considered as one of the main parameters to expand the reductive
cleavage methods [26] .

4.3. Oxidation

In  opposition  to  reduction  catalytic  reactions  that  generate
chemicals with reduced functionality, oxidation methods produce
platform  chemicals  with  enhanced  functionality.  Owing  to  the
presence of various functional groups in lignin structure, function-
alization through oxidation is one of the promising approaches for
lignin upgrading. Oxidation methods favor the formation of vari-
ous  monomeric  and  fine  chemicals  including  aldehydes,  ketones
and carboxylic acids. For example, production of vanillin and sy-
ringaldehyde as platform chemicals have been reported [102,103] .
A wide range of catalysts including metal-free, organometallics
and nitroxide compounds are used for lignin oxidation [57] . Of ni-
troxides, TEMPO is the most frequently used compound for alcohol
oxidation processes because of its stability and availability [104] .
The following sections are organized based on the type of lignin
modifications via TEMPO oxidation process. Prior to discussion on
the mechanism of the reactions, general aspects of TEMPO are pre-
sented.

5. TEMPO reactions

5.1. TEMPO structure

TEMPO, a red-orange solid with low melting point (36–38 °C),
is  an  inexpensive  stable  nitroxyl  radical,  which  is  used  for  the
conversion of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds,
e.g., aldehydes or ketones [105,106] . TEMPO was first introduced
in 1960 by Lebedev and Kazarnovskii [107] . TEMPO  can be syn-
thesized  through  a  reductive  step  of  triacetoneamine  (a  fre-
quently used material as a light stabilizer for plastic) to 2,2,6,6-
tetramethylpiperidine  followed  by  an  oxidation  step  to  TEMPO
( Fig. 3 (a)) [108,109] .

The  structure  of  TEMPO  and  examples  of  its  derivatives  are
shown in Fig. 3 (b). Intensive studies into the electronic and chem-
ical structures of TEMPO have been performed in order to under-
stand the parameters associated with its reactivity [104 , 110–113] .
It is stated that the NO bond bears “partial double bond” character
(bond order of 1.5 and the bond length of 1.25 0 A) attributed to

the delocalization of the free electron between the nitrogen and
oxygen  atom  [104] .  The  delocalization  energy  estimated  for  the
free electron is approximately 120 kJ/mol [113] . The two resonance
structures of TEMPO as the indications of the electron delocaliza-
tion are shown in Fig. 3 (c). Generally, the spin density distribution
is toward the oxygen, hence the spin density at oxygen is larger
than at nitrogen [112] . The pair of bulky gem-dimethyl groups in
the molecular structure of TEMPO increase its stability by inhibit-
ing dimerization via O –O, N –O or N –N bonds [33] .

5.2. TEMPO/Solvent interactions

In  lignin  oxidation  and  depolymerization  reactions,  TEMPO  is
generally accompanied by a solvent to enhance the yield and con-
versation rates in reactions. The catalytic compounds need to be
dissolved  in  solvent  to  minimize  the  mass  transfer  limitations
[116,117] . Several important factors including polarity and hydrogen
bond donating/accepting influence the solvent choice for TEMPO
reactions [118] .

One  of  the  parameters  affecting  the  reactivity  of  the  catalyst
is the electronic distribution in a radical obtained from the dipole
moment [110] , which is involved in the solvatochromism. The sol-
vatochromism is considered when a solute dissolved in solvents of
varying polarity manifests a pronounced change in position, inten-
sity, and shape of an absorption band [119] . TEMPO having a dipole
moment of 3D corresponds to a polar molecule. The results pre-
sented by Lalevee et al. [110] for dipole moment, spin and electron
densities of the TEMPO in different solvents are shown in Table 3 .

6. TEMPO-catalyzed oxidation and depolymerization of lignin
models

As mentioned earlier, lignin structure consists of a variety of al-
cohols linked by different bonds. Benzylic alcohols and allylic alco-
hols can be considered as the representatives for monomeric lignin
model compounds. Therefore, most of the mechanisms developed
for  alcohol  oxidation  can  be  applied  for  lignin  oxidation.  Lignin
oxidation  investigations  can  be  conducted  either  on  monomeric
or dimeric lignin models. Owing to lignin’s complex structure, re-
search  on  TEMPO  oxidation  of  lignin  mostly  use  dimeric  lignin
model  compounds  with  specific  linkages  and  functional  groups
similar  to  native  lignin  [120] .  Taking  synthesized  lignin  model
compounds instead of native lignin for oxidation studies provides
the possibility for detailed analysis of reactions, resulting in a bet-
ter  understanding  of  oxidation  and  depolymerization  processes.
Fig. 4 presents examples of lignin models utilized for TEMPO ox-
idation and depolymerization studies.

The phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyl groups in lignin provide re-
active sites for producing quinones [94,135] , aldehydes or ketones
[131,136]  by TEMPO  catalyzed oxidation.  Fig. 5  depicts examples
of products from TEMPO oxidation and depolymerization of lignin
with and without C –C and C –O bond cleavage.

6.1. Oxidation of lignin models without bond cleavage

Lignin  oxidation  without  bond  cleavage  can  be  interpreted
as  lignin  functionalization  where  the  linkage  remains  intact.  As
described,  although  lignin  structure  has  many  functionalities,
they are often sterically hindered by the highly crosslinked lignin
macromolecule [57] . Depending on the lignin’s structure and reac-
tion conditions, different products are formed from the oxidation
of lignin. Examples of oxidized products without bond cleavage are
presented in Fig. 5 (a). It has been speculated that TEMPO oxidation
can  weaken  C –C/C –O  bonds  adjacent  to  the  C α hydroxyl  group,
which may lead to lignin depolymerization (see Sections 6.2 and
6.3 ).

6.1.1. TEMPO catalytic systems containing transition-metal-free
components

The transition-metal-free TEMPO catalytic oxidation process of-
ten goes through N-oxoammonium salt pathway. N-oxoammonium
salt ( Fig. 6 ) is produced via one-electron transfer reaction during
the TEMPO oxidation and can be isolated as an oxidant [141] . In
alcohol oxidation mediated by oxoammonium salt, a two-electron

reduction of the oxoammonium species results in a hydroxylamine
(TEMPOH). Various stoichiometric oxidants, such as bleach, hypo-
halides, or combination of O
2 with NO x can be used in combina-
tion with TEMPO to conduct the alcohol oxidation process.

For  example,  hypochlorite  (NaOCl)  has  been  mentioned  in
Anelli-Montanari protocol ( Fig. 7 ) where the reaction takes place
via the oxoammonium salt [142–144] . In this method, potassium

bromide is used as cocatalyst. It is noted that this is an alcohol
oxidation protocol, which is applied for lignin oxidation as well.

Depending on the pH, the mechanisms for oxidations are differ-
ent ( Fig. 8 ). In basic conditions, the reaction complex formed be-
tween oxoammonium species and alkoxide could be generated by
the attack of an alkoxide on the oxygen or nitrogen atom of the
cation. A study affirmed the favourability of the pathway involving
the nitrogen atom [145] . Under basic conditions, in the presence

of both primary and secondary alcohols, the steric effects in the
formation of an alkoxide adduct with the oxoammonium species
result in chemoselective oxidation of primary alcohols attributed
to the faster oxidation of primary alcohols in comparison with the
more hindered secondary ones [146] . As the primary alcohols are
somewhat more acidic than secondary alcohols in solution, there
will be a higher concentration of a primary alkoxide than a sec-
ondary  one  in  solution  [145] .  In  acid  conditions,  the  selectivity

changes and the mechanism involves a bimolecular hydride trans-
fer, which favors more-electron-rich substrates, and the adduct is
more likely to be a reactive intermediate [108,112 , 146] . Notably, the
higher the pH, the higher the oxidation rate for both primary and
secondary alcohols [145] .

Aerobic oxidation is a frequently used method for alcohol and
lignin oxidation [147] . From the sustainability perspective, O
2 as a
terminal oxidant is favorable and safe [148] . The number of studies
on aerobic TEMPO oxidation systems is increasing vastly. Rahimi

et al. [120] investigated various catalytic systems, e.g., metal and
metal-free containing catalytic systems, for aerobic oxidation of the
secondary benzylic alcohol within a lignin model compound corre-
sponding to β–O–4 linkage ( Table 4 , entry 1–8). Most of the cata-
lysts resulted in a high conversion (66 −100%) and acceptable selec-
tivity in oxidation of lignin model 1S. Only bleach/ TEMPO catalyst
system at pH 9 exhibited acceptable selectivity for primary alcohol
oxidation ( Table 4 , entry 1). Acetonitrile (MeCN)/water as a solvent
afforded higher conversion (100%) in oxidation of 1S than MeCN

alone ( Table 4 , entries 5 and 6). Presence of the NO x sources, such
as NaNO
3 as the recyclable dioxygen activators, appears
to be favorable for an aerobic metal-free oxidation of lignin. The
mechanism of alcohol oxidation via TEMPO/HCl/NaNO
2  was pro-
posed by Wang et al. and shown in Fig. 9 [149] . It was found that
hydrochloric  acid,  an  inexpensive  and  readily  available  inorganic
acid, cooperated exquisitely with NaNO
2 /TEMPO for facilitating the
aerobic oxidation of the substrate to the corresponding aldehyde
under mild conditions. According to the suggested hypothesis, the
acidic reaction conditions and the existence of chlorine or bromine,
whether positive, negative or neutral, is crucial for obtaining the
overall catalytic activity of the TEMPO/NaNO

2 catalyst.

The catalyst system consisting of 4-acetamido-TEMPO (5 mol%;
3 and HCl (10 mol% each)
AcNH-TEMPO) in combination with HNO
( Table 4 , entry 6) showed very good selectivity for secondary al-
cohol oxidation. Comparison of the reactions of benzylic alcohols
showed that electron-rich substrates reacted more rapidly and led
to higher yields of ketones [120] . Stahl and co-workers [120] also
reported excellent yields of ketone for the oxidation of the S-type
models with or without phenols ( Table 4 , entries 7 and 8). It was
shown that the presence of acidic O –H group in phenolic lignin
structure could lead to catalyst inhibition [150] . Moderate to excel-
lent yields of ketones 1P (53%) and 8P (96%) were obtained from
2 /O
the oxidation of lignin models 1S and 10S using TEMPO/NaNO
2
in the presence of dichloromethane (DCM) ( Table 4 , entries 9 and
10) [124] .

Encouraging results were reported for the aerobic oxidation of
2 /NaCl ( Table 4 , entries 11–13),
lignin models using TEMPO/NaNO
where the corresponding ketones 5P,6P and 7P were produced in
97%,75% and 84% isolated yield, respectively. However, this method
was not successful for the oxidation of components containing free
phenolic hydroxyl groups where they converted to insoluble prod-
ucts [105] . The proposed method may not be efficient on native
lignin  owing  to  the  presence  of  unprotected  phenolic  hydroxyls
in  lignin.  Moreover,  bromination  of  the  highly  electron-rich  aro-
matic ring using TEMPO/Br
2  and TEMPO/1,3-dibromo-5,5-
dimethylhydantoin/NaNO

2 systems was reported [105] .

2 /NaNO

A transition metal free catalytic system containing TEMPO and
(diacetoxy)iodobenzene  (DAIB)  was  recently  reported  for  oxida-
tion  of  primary  hydroxyl  groups  over  secondary  ones  ( Table  4 ,
entry 14) [121] . No product resulting from the secondary alcohol
oxidation  was  observed  confirming  the  high  chemoselectivity  of
oxidation.

6.1.2. TEMPO catalytic systems containing transition metal
components

TEMPO catalytic systems containing transition metals, e.g., Cu,
Fe  and  V,  have  emerged  as  effective  systems  for  alcohol  oxida-
tion [136 , 151–153] . Wang and co-workers [128] used β–O–4 lignin
models  with  C β –OH  and  C γ –OH  bonds  to  test  the  performance
of vanadyl sulphate (VOSO
4 )/TEMPO catalyst system ( Table 4 , en-
tries  15  and  16),  which  were  introduced  for  alcohol  oxidation
4 exhibited a higher oxidation activity than other vana-
[154] . VOSO
dium compounds, e.g., V
3 . It was suggested
that the oxidation process probably occurred through a non-radical
pathway. V(IV) in the presence of TEMPO and acetonitrile (CH
3 CN)
was oxidized by dioxygen and a V(V) complex was formed, which
resulted in alcohol oxidation [154] .

Cu/TEMPO  catalysts  are  one  of  the  practical  systems  for  al-
cohol  oxidation.  As  one  of  the  earliest  works,  the  application
of  CuCl/TEMPO  for  the  oxidation  of  primary  benzylic  and  al-
lylic alcohols was reported by Semmelhack and co-workers [155] .
Later  Stahl  and  co-worker  [150]  used  a  Cu(I)  salt  with  a  non-
coordinating  anion  (CuOTf,  where  OTf  is  trifluoromethanesul-
fonate).  The  catalyst  containing  (bpy)Cu(I)/TEMPO  (where  bpy  is
2,2 ʹ-bipyridine) was effective in the oxidation of alcohols ( Fig. 10 ).
A two-step mechanism including catalyst oxidation and substrate
oxidation  has  been  proposed.  The  oxidations  of  Cu(I)  and  TEM-
POH  by  O
2  taking  place  in  the  first  step  and  alcohol  oxidation
mediated by TEMPO radical and Cu(II) was processed in the sec-
ond step. This system applies for the oxidation of a broad range of
primary alcohols, including allylic, benzylic, and aliphatic deriva-
tives to generate aldehydes. The aforementioned system has some
advantages:  (i)  the  reaction  can  be  carried  out  at  room  tem-
perature  with  ambient  air  as  the  oxidant,  (ii)  system  is  com-
patible  with  a  wide  range  of  functional  groups,  (iii)  the  cat-
alytic system affords a high selectivity for primary alcohols, and
(iv) the reactions show excellent selectivity for primary over sec-
ondary  alcohols  without  overoxidation  of  aldehyde  to  carboxylic
acid [156] .

The  catalyst  containing  CuCl/TEMPO  was  applied  for  the  oxi-
dation  of  lignin  models  bearing  primary  and  secondary  alcohols
( Table 4 , entries 17 and 18) [131] . As seen in Table 4 (entries 1–
3 and 8), the lignin model compounds are mostly oxidized at the
secondary position and clearly the number of reports devoted to
the oxidation of primary hydroxyl group over the secondary one is
limited.

6.2. TEMPO oxidation of lignin models followed by bond cleavage

Reactions  could  occur  in  series  for  producing  lignin-based
value-added materials. In this case, an intermediate lignin based
product, e.g., ketone, could be converted to generate valuable ma-
terials, such as acids [157–159] . In these conversions, a bond cleav-
age reaction of lignin is needed.

A selective oxidation of β–O–4 lignin model into more labile
ketone or aldehyde that could be further oxidized into low molec-
ular weight aromatic products was proposed in a two-step oxida-
tive depolymerization of lignin in Fig. 11 [122,123,160] . A function-
alized  lignin  compound  is  produced  as  an  intermediate  product,
which is followed by cleavage of the bonds to form fragments. In
such a process, TEMPO is often used in the first step to convert the
alcohol to ketone or aldehyde.

6.2.1. Bond cleavage initiated by oxidized ketone

Such  a  strategy  was  used  by  Wang  et  al.  [128]  to  produce
aromatic  acids  from  a  model  lignin  containing  β–O–4  linkage
( Table  5 ,  entry  1).  In  the  proposed  protocol,  the  oxidation  of
4 /TEMPO  catalyst  afforded  β–O–4  ke-
lignin  model  using  VOSO
tone ( Table 4 , entries 17 and 18). In the second step, ketone ox-
2 /1,10-phenanthroline  complex  results  in
idation  using  a  Cu(OAc)
C –C bond cleavage. The proposed reaction mechanism is shown in
Fig. 12 . The copper-oxo-bridged dimer generated from the reaction
2 /1,10-phenanthroline with oxygen was the catalytically
of Cu(OAc)
ß–H bond, which was
active site for hydrogen-abstraction from C
the rate-determining step for the C –C bond cleavage [128] .

A wide range of β–O–4 ketones, e.g., ketones with and without
methoxy groups and ketones with C γ –OH, which were formed in
the first step, was successfully transformed to acids with yields of
80–95%. The yield of acids and reaction conditions are affected by
the β–O–4 ketone’s structure. For example, C γ –OH bond of the ke-

tone makes the C α–C β bond more resistant and therefore a higher
temperature  is  needed  for  the  reaction.  Phenolic  β–O–4  ketone
also causes a lower yield of acid. Notably, the proposed catalyst
was not efficient for bond cleavage of β–1 lignin and the major
products resulted from C –H bond oxidation [32,128] .

Metal-free  aerobic  alcohol  oxidation  using  TEMPO  in  combi-
nation with an inorganic nitrogen oxide, such as nitric acid and
sodium nitrite, could also be used for the aforementioned purpose
[94,120] . Targeting the bond cleavage of the benzylic ketone (1P)
(see Table 4 , entries 1a–1h), H
2  under basic conditions can be
2 O
used  in  the  second  step  where  veratric  acid  (34P)  and  guaiacol
(35P)  are  the  final  products  ( Table  5 ,  entry  2)  [122] .  The  treat-
ment  performed  with  excess  sodium  formate  in  aqueous  formic
acid (85–90 wt%) was also effective for C –O bond cleavage ( Table 5 ,
entry  3).  Considering  the  difference  in  the  raw  materials,  it  can
be concluded that the presence of C α ketone is important for suf-
ficient bond cleavage [122] . The mechanism of lignin depolymer-
ization using formic acid was explained by Wang [161] in which
formic acid plays two roles; first as a substrate, where the hydroxyl
group of oxidized lignin is converted to a better leaving formate
group and second its formate anion and its proton are used for H β
abstraction and protonation of C β = C γ , respectively.

Photochemical  reactions  gained  attention  in  the  subject  of
lignin  conversion  [123,162,163] .  In  this  approach,  the  excited
electron–hole  pairs  are  generated  upon  light  irradiation  of  a
wide-band gap semiconductor, which can be applied in chemical
processes  to  create/degrade  specific  compounds  [164] .  There  are
several reports regarding the bond cleavage using photochemical
reactions [163,165,166] . In one report, the chemoselective benzylic
oxidation utilizing [4-AcNH-TEMPO]BF
4  and silica was performed
in  the  first  step,  and  the  fragmentation  products  were  gener-
ated in high yield from C –O bond cleavage via the photocatalyst
6 ( Table 5 , entries 4–6) and in the subsequent
[Ir(ppy)
step [125] .

6.3. TEMPO oxidation of lignin models with bond cleavage

Efficient  depolymerization  methods  must  be  able  to  cleave
the  strong  C –O  and/or  C –C  bonds  and  tolerate  a  large  variabil-
ity  of  lignin  structures  derived  from  different  types  of  biomass
[167,168] . Metal complex catalysts are commonly used for this pur-
pose [142,169 , 170] . A copper(II)/TEMPO catalyst was developed by
Gamez et al. [170] for the oxidation of primary alcohols to alde-
hydes. Benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde (100% con-
version)  after  2.5 h  of  reaction  using  a  CuBr
2 (Bipy)-TEMPO  cat-
alytic system. It was stated that the presence of ligand in the cop-
per  catalytic  system  was  an  important  factor  affecting  the  con-
version rate of substrates [136,137] . For example, only 6% of ben-
zaldehyde  (53P)  was  obtained  from  benzyl  alcohol  in  a  CuBr
2 -
TEMPO catalytic system (no ligand) in 1.5 h of reaction. The poor
solubility  of  the  copper  catalyst  was  proposed  as  a  main  rea-
son  for  this  low  conversion.  Notably,  the  conversion  rate  in-
creased  to  83%  in  the  presence  of  2,2-bipyridine  as  a  ligand.  In
this type of reaction, TEMPO is proposed to serve as a hydrogen
acceptor.

A  possible  pathway  for  the  reaction  involves  coordination  of
TEMPO to copper, followed by a hydrogen atom abstraction [129] .
Contrarily, no reaction occurred for secondary alcohols in the same
catalytic system due to steric hindrance resulting from presence of
methyl groups in secondary alcohol structure [136,170] .

Progress  has  been  made  in  alcohol  conversions  using  cata-
lysts containing copper for lignin conversion. Bond cleavage was
observed  in  treatment  of  1,2-diphenyl-2-methoxyethanol  (19S),
benzoin  methyl  ether  (24P)  and  1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-
methoxyphenoxy)  propane-1,3-diol  (6S)  by  CuCl/TEMPO  in  pyri-
dine system ( Table 6 , entries 1 to 4)). It has been proposed that
a single electron transfer pathway operates in the copper/TEMPO
system  [129,171] .  Direct  C –C  bond  cleavage  of  lignin  model  19S

6.2.2. Bond cleavage initiated by oxidized aldehyde

A  retro-aldol  reaction  was  reported  for  bond  cleavage  of
product  2P  generated  in  situ  from  a  lignin  model  compound
( Table 5 , entries 7–11). Product 2P was obtained from the oxida-
tion of primary hydroxyl groups using TEMPO/DBID catalytic sys-
tem (see Table 4 , entry 14). Dl-proline as an organocatalyst was
used  to  effect  the  bond  cleavage  of  the  product  afforded  in  the
first  step.  The  benzaldehyde  derivatives,  methoxyphenols  and  2-
aryloxyacetaldehydes were obtained from bond cleavage step.

was reported without generation of ketone intermediate [172] . No-
tably,  pure  oxygen  atmosphere  and  high  catalyst  loading  are  vi-
tal to achieve a high conversion rate in the aforementioned sys-
tem. However, the instability of the active copper catalytic species
in these systems necessitates the requirement for multiple addi-
tions  of  CuCl/TEMPO  during  reaction.  The  oxidation  of  8P  with
2 /TEMPO results in the C –C bond cleavage ( Table 6 , entry 5).
CuCl
An increase in the amount of TEMPO in the system decreased the
conversion and yield of by-products, suggesting that the reaction
was governed by a free-radical mechanism [137,173] .

Reactivity  of  phenolic  and  non-phenolic  β–O–4  lignin  mod-
els with [Cu(OTf)]/ 2,6-lutidine/TEMPO was investigated by Baker
aryl  bond  was  re-
[126] .  The  selective  bond  cleavage  of  the  C α-C
ported for phenolic β–O–4 lignin model ( Table 6 , entries 6 and 7).
Oxidation  of  non-phenolic  lignin  model  in  2,6-lutidine  mediated
by stoichiometric CuOTf/TEMPO afforded a high yield of aldehyde
( Table  6 ,  entries  8  and  9).  However,  the  formation  of  undefined
by-products limits its utility in reactions. Hanson and coworkers
[127] used β–1 linked diols as a substrate to further investigate
the  potential  of  aerobic  oxidation  of  lignin  with  copper/TEMPO
catalyst  systems.  Nonphenolic  and  phenolic  models  were  chosen
to simulate β–1 lignin structure [127] . Under the treatment with
CuOTf/2,6-lutidine/TEMPO in toluene ( Table 6 , entry 10), the non-
phenolic  lignin  model  compounds  generated  products  resulting
from  C –C  bond  cleavage.  The  oxidation  of  phenolic  lignin  using
the  stoichiometric  copper  leads  to  fragments  ( Table  6 ,  entry  11)
while utilizing catalytic copper ( Table 6 , entry 12) afforded ketone
(30P) as a major product. As previously described, the copper cat-

alyst is inhibited by the phenolic functional groups. Therefore, the
requirement of stoichiometric amount of copper to facilitate C –C
bond cleavage can be considered as one drawback of this catalyst
system [127] . Treatment of 1:1 mixture of β–1 and β–O–4 lignin
model compounds with catalytic amount of copper ( Table 6 , entry
13) resulted in aldehyde as the major product along with ketone
in low yield. The analysis revealed that the β–1 lignin model re-
acts slightly faster than the β–O–4 lignin model with the copper
catalyst.

7. TEMPO oxidation strategies for technical lignin

Most TEMPO oxidation strategies have been employed for the
oxidation of lignin models. Currently, limited information is avail-
able for TEMPO oxidation of technical lignins, which is discussed
in this section.

In a study performed by Diaz-Urrutia et al. [15] , the Organo-
solv  lignin  was  subjected  to  different  catalyst  systems  such  as
CuOTf/TEMPO and 4-acetamido-TEMPO/HNO
3 /HCl, and the perfor-
mance  of  the  catalytic  systems  was  reported  according  to  the
quantitative  heteronuclear  single  quantum  coherence  (q-HSQC)
and gel permeation chromatography data ( Fig. 13 and Table 7 ). The
catalyst breaks the major units of A, B, C and D, oxidizing S2/6 to
S ʹ and S ʺ in which (S ʹ+ S ʺ)/S2/6 increased from 0.26 (in the control
sample with no catalyst) to 0.73.

The results provided in Table 7 reveal that CuOTf/TEMPO/2,6-
lutidine  produces  the  ketones  with  a  lower  molecular  weight
(413 g/mol). Comparison between entries 2 and 4 (Table) suggests

Attempts for oxidation of organosolv Alcell lignin, which was
rich in syringl units and a high proportion of β–O–4 linkages, re-
sulted in only 36% of lignin oxidation [128] . Dabral et al. [121] re-
ported  one-pot  two-step  method  for  degradation  of  organosolv
beechwood  lignin  (OS-BWL)  ( Table  8 ,  entry  1).  The  catalyst  sys-
tem containing TEMPO/DAIB in CH
3 CN (a similar catalyst system
reported  for  lignin  models,  see  Table  5 ,  entries  7–11)  was  used
for  chemoselective  oxidation  followed  by  degradation  using  DL-
proline.  The  organic  fraction  (15 wt%  of  the  starting  lignin)  was
analyzed  by  gas  chromatography-mass  spectrometry  (GC-MS)  in

which various monomeric aromatics, e.g., 0.3 wt% guaiacol (35P),
2.5 wt% syringaldehyde (39P) and 1.1 wt% vanillin (40P) were de-
tected.

Very  recently,  the  same  group  studied  the  structural  changes
in OS-BWL subjected to the mechanochemical oxidative transfor-
mation in the presence of HO –TEMPO (0.2 equiv), KBr (0.2 equiv),
and  Oxone  (1.5  equiv)  [139] .  The  two-dimensional  (HSQC)  NMR
spectra  (see  Fig.  14 )  from  the  untreated  and  mechanochemical
treated OS-BWL samples presented the substantial changes in the
aliphatic regions, where integrals values corresponding to the β–
O–4 (cid:4)  aryl ether linkages and phenylcoumaran substructures were
diminished.  The  treatment  after  90 min  resulted  in  40%  benzylic

oxidation with increased integrals for the cross peaks correspond-
ing to oxidized syringyl S (cid:4) and guaiacyl G (cid:4) units. The degree of ox-
idation also increased to 84% after 180 min milling. The analysis of
the organic-soluble phase was presented in Table 8 , entry 2. These
monomers resulted from the oxidation of terminal phenolic groups
present in the lignin sample. It is notable that, by using a vibrating
disk mill, a wider range of monomeric products was obtained in
less time (30 min) ( Table 8 , entry 3) [139] .

A method for the oxidation of C α alcohols to ketones in tech-
nical  lignin  using  AcNH-  TEMPO/HNO
3 /HCl  catalyst  system  re-
sulted in a 90% conversion to oxidized lignin [120] . Following this
progress in lignin oxidation, a two-step protocol was examined for
technicallignin degradation [122] . The method was first examined
on Poplar lignin isolated from an enzymatic pretreatment method
( Table 8 , entry 4). The oxidized lignin afforded 51.2% yield of low
molecular-weight aromatics, while the yield decreased to approx-
imately  10 wt%  for  non-oxidized  lignin  [122] .  Recently,  the  same
research  group  applied  the  above-mentioned  method  on  divers
lignin samples derived from different plant sources (poplar, maize,
and  maple)  and  pretreatment  methods  (see  Table  8 ,  entries  5–
12)  [140] .  The  pretreatment  methods  included  a  mild  acidolysis
pretreatment  employing HCl/dioxane  (acidolysis),  extraction  with
γ -valerolactone  containing  dilute  sulfuric  acid  (GVL),  an  extrac-
tive  ammonia  process  (EA),  and  a  copper-alkaline  hydrogen  per-
oxide  (Cu-AHP).  Comparing  to  the  conventional  processes,  such

as kraft which extensively altered lignin structures, these GVL, EA
and Cu-AHP pretreatment methods have been known to generate
Native-like  lignins.  A  variety  of  low-molecular-weight  aromatics
with various yields ranging from 3–42%, depending on the lignin
source and pretreatment method, was generated after the reaction
[140] . These compounds can be used as the primary components
of phenol-resins, including resorcinol-formaldehyde-resins. Produc-
tion of vanillin (41P) is of great interest in the proposed method, as
it is the only lignin-derived building block used to create bio-based
amines from lignin [174] . Nowadays, such macromolecules are used
in different fields, such as biofuel and energy storage [175] .

The observations revealed that the loss of the β-ether subunit
resulted  from  pretreatment  process  or  presence  of  components
(for example, hydroxycinnamate components with alkenes), which
could lead to the inhibition of radical NO x -based cocatalysts, af-
fected the catalytic cleavage of lignin, resulting in a lower yield of
aromatics.

8. Novel potential routes for TEMPO oxidation of lignin

As stated earlier, alcohol oxidation is a key reaction in lignin
oxidation. In view of recent developments in alcohol oxidation us-

conventional TEMPO catalytic systems. This section aims to draw
the researchers’ attention to these new strategies.

8.1. Implementation of ionic liquids

To simplify product isolation and catalyst recovery, the use of
binary supported catalysts or ionic liquids (ILs) offers an alterna-
tive  [176,177] .  Recently,  various  studies  on  the  alcohol  oxidation

have been directed toward the use of IL-supported TEMPO catalysts
[178–180] . ILs are organic salts with low melting points and very
low vapor pressures [181,182] . Most ILs are viscous liquids, which
sometimes hampers mass transfer in reaction systems [183] . How-
ever, the possibility to tune its polarity makes the IL a favourable
medium for synthesis [176,184,185] .

for oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes [186] . High yields
( > 70%) of ketones and aldehydes could be obtained through the
aerobic  oxidation  of  primary  and  secondary  alcohols  using  the
TEMPO/CuCl catalytic system in 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hex-
afluorophosphate ([bmim][PF6]), one of the most widely used ILs),
in  which  no  trace  of  overoxidation  to  carboxylic  acids  was  ob-
served  [187] .  Following  this  reaction  pathway,  benzylic  and  al-
lylic  alcohols  were  oxidized  with  excellent  conversions  ( > 90%),
whereas aliphatic alcohols were slow and less reactive [187] . Ox-

idation of lignin model compounds (1S, 10S, 25S and 26S) using

[124] . Notably, comparing to the conventional solvents (see Table 4 ,
entries 4, 11 and 12), the oxidation rates were lower in the IL sol-
vents [124] . One of the problems associated with using ILs in lignin
oxidation includes difficulty in the separation of aromatic products
derived from lignin. It was stated that the aromatic products can
often be soluble in the ionic liquid due to the π - π interactions be-
tween the ionic liquid and aromatic moieties, which hampers the

extraction of aromatic products from the reaction mixture [24] . In
addition, separation and recovery of TEMPO must be considered.
Difficulties in recycling the TEMPO in presence of the IL originate
from TEMPO leaching into the organic solvent extraction medium.
In this regard, utilizing TEMPO derivatives containing polar func-
tionalities has been suggested [188] . ILs can also be functionalized
for specific applications, known as “task-specific ILs” [189] . TEMPO-
derived task-specific IL (TEMPO/IL) has been implemented as a cat-
alyst in the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols [178,183] .
Metal-free catalysts NaOCl/KBr/H
2 O (at pH 8.6) in the presence of
TEMPO/IL  ( Fig.  15 ) afforded  aldehydes  and  ketones  with  86–96%
yield [178,183] . In these reactions, the catalysts and oxidant could
often be recovered and recycled [178] .

Ammonium-tagged TEMPO ( Fig. 16 ) was used for the oxidation
of a variety of alcohols in IL; its synthesis is illustrated in Fig. 16 (a).
This compound was used for oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol in an
IL (24S, primary alcohol represented as a monomer lignin model),
affording cinnamaldehyde in 99% yield ( Fig. 16 (b)). Moreover, fur-
ther experiments revealed that the TEMPO derivative bearing an
ammonium moiety is a more effective mediator for alcohol oxida-
tion than TEMPO itself [188] . In this case, the ammonium tag leads
to ease of recycling N-oxy radicals in the IL and increasing the ox-
idation rate [188] .

8.2. TEMPO immobilization

Progress  in  chemistry  provided  a  new  class  of  TEMPO  cat-
alysts  produced  by  immobilization  onto  various  supports,  e.g.,

silica  and  polymers,  facilitating  recyclability  [182] .  As  an  ex-
ample,  poly(ethylene  glycol)-supported  TEMPO  (PEG/TEMPO),  in
which  a  TEMPO  moiety  is  attached  to  the  polymeric  backbone
through  a  benzylic  ether  linkage,  is  one  of  the  most  studied
TEMPO-polymeric catalyst systems (see Fig. 17 (a)) [190] . Such cat-
alysts mostly exhibit high solubility in both aqueous and organic
solvents  and  the  dissolved  polymer-supported  catalysts  can  be
recovered  by  precipitation  with  a  suitable  solvent,  such  as  di-
ethyl  ether.  A  combination  of  PEG/TEMPO  and  Co(NO
2 and
Mn(NO
2  as  co-catalysts  used  for  alcohol  oxidation  afforded  a
conversion of mostly higher than 90% [191] . For example, oxida-
tion of cinnamyl alcohol (24S) with a mixture of 2 mol% Mn(NO
2 ,
2 and PEG/TEMPO (10 mol%) in acetic acid at 40 °C
2 mol% Co(NO
for 6 h resulted in excellent conversion and selectivity ( > 99%) (see
Fig. 17 (b)) [191] .

In  order  to  increase  the  interaction  between  TEMPO  and  the
surface  support,  Beejapur  and  co-workers  suggested  the  modifi-
cation of TEMPO with an imidazolium tag [133] . In this context,
Bis(imidazolium)-tagged TEMPO catalysts were adsorbed on differ-
ent silica gels, i.e., silica gel modified with highly crosslinked poly-
meric imidazolium networks ( Fig. 18 ), and magnetic particles en-
trapped with highly crosslinked polymeric imidazolium networks.
A  variety  of  products  were  obtained  with  high  yields  from  the
oxidation  of  primary  and  secondary  aliphatic  and  benzylic  alco-
hols.  The  combination  of  catalyst  and  support  acts  as  a  catalyst
reservoir, where solvent removal after reaction completion leads to
readsorption of catalyst on the support. In this case, solvent extrac-
tion of the product did not dissolve the adsorbed catalyst. After 12

cycles, the morphology of the material appeared to be similar to
that of the starting material ( Fig. 18 (b) and (c)). Notably, one of
the substrates in the study corresponded to a lignin model com-
pound mimicking the α–1 linkage. Substrate 23S was oxidized us-
ing supported catalysts in the presence of [bis(acetoxy)iodo] ben-
zene (BAIB) in DCM at room temperature. The catalysts afforded an
excellent yield (95%) of product 31P [133] .

8.3. Electrocatalytic oxidation

Most  of  the  investigations  on  electrocatalytic  TEMPO  oxida-
tion  were  reported  for  alcohols  and  not  specifically  for  lignin.
Nonetheless, the information provided in the following paragraphs
may shed light on TEMPO electrooxidation of lignin.

The electrochemical oxidation method provides an alternative
to the chemical oxidation of alcohols [192–197] . However, TEMPO
exhibits high reactivity with alcohols, and the need for high elec-

trode  potentials  to  generate  the  reactive  oxoammonium  species
limits  its  application  in  electrochemical  oxidation  [198] .  Table  9
summarizes the catalytic activity of TEMPO and its derivatives by
means of the ratio of the peak oxidative catalytic current divided
by the peak reductive catalytic current ( i pa / i pc ) cat , which is approx-
imately equal to

nitroxyl radical. (Adapted from Ref. [199] with permission of American Chemical Society).

TEMPO is electrochemically oxidized from a nitroxyl radical T ∗
to the oxoammonium cation T + , i.e., the catalytically active species
corresponding to an oxidation potential of E a 1 . A TEMPO derived
intermediate complex is then formed through an alcohol substrate
nucleophilic  attack  on  the  nitrogen  of  T + .  In  the  next  step,  the
aldehyde and reduced hydroxylamine form of TEMPO (TH) are gen-
erated  via  a  two-electron  oxidation  of  the  substrate.  The  active
form of the catalyst is then electrochemically regenerated by an
overall one proton coupled-two-electron oxidation of TH. The sec-
ond oxidative step occurs at an oxidation potential defined as E a 2 .
E a 1 is independent of pH, while E a 2 decreases with the increase in
pH. The catalytic activity of TEMPO is proportional to the inverse
of the difference in E a 1 and E a 2 [199] .

A protocol for the TEMPO-mediated electrooxidation of primary
and secondary alcohol using a microfluidic apparatus was devel-
oped  by  Hill-Cousins  and  co-workers  [200]  and  a  high  conver-
sion  of  alcohols  to  aldehydes  and  ketones  was  reported  in  an
aqueous tert -butanol ( t BuOH) system at ambient temperature. As
an example, a high yield of cinnamaldehyde (77%) was obtained
with corresponding lignin model 24S. Bosque et al. [132] showed
that  TEMPO  is  too  weak  to  abstract  the  benzylic  hydrogen  of
C –H = 84 Kcal/mol), which is attributed to its low BDE
lignin (BDE
(71 Kcal/mol). Initial experiments showed a low conversion (maxi-
mum 8%) of lignin source14S to product 12P in the bulk electrolysis
experiments using TEMPO (and carbonate buffer (pH = 10)/MeCN
at potential 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl as a media) [132] .

Considerable  effort  in  the  electrochemical  oxidation  field  has
shown  that  a  dual  catalyst  containing  TEMPO,  as  an  electron-
proton  transfer  mediator,  and  transition  metals,  such  as  copper,
could be used to form TEMPO · at much lower potential compared
to  that  needed  for  TEMPO +  [198] .  Badalyan  and  Stahl  [198]  re-
ported the oxidation rates of six para-substituted benzyl alcohols
with both (bpy)Cu(I)OTf/TEMPO/triethylamine (Et
3 N) ( Fig. 20 ) and
TEMPO/N-methylimidazole  (NMI),  where  the  former  exhibited  a
higher  oxidation  rate.  The  electrochemical  oxidation  of  alcohols
using  (bpy)Cu/TEMPO  catalyst  proceeds  at  the  (bpy)Cu(II)/
(bpy)Cu(I)  redox  potential.  In  the  oxidation  reaction,  Cu(II)  and
TEMPO act as a one-electron oxidant and an electron-proton ac-
ceptor, respectively. The catalyst system exploits the low-potential,
proton-coupled  TEMPO/TEMPOH  redox  process  rather  than  the
high-potential TEMPO/TEMPO + process.

An  interesting  development  in  the  use  of  TEMPO  for  elec-
trochemical  oxidation  of  alcohols  involves  the  functionalization
of  electrodes  with  TEMPO  [194] .  The  crucial  factors  in  develop-
ing  electrochemical  processes  are  long-term  stability,  good  reac-
tivity,  and  a  broad  range  of  applicability  of  electrodes  to  differ-
ent alcohols. These factors have encouraged a focus on integrating
the polymeric, sol–gel and nanostructured electrodes with TEMPO
[194,201] . Following the above-mentioned strategies, a thin layer

of organosilica doped with TEMPO electrodeposited on the surface
of an ITO-coated glass was used for alcohol oxidation [195,202] .
Fig. 21 shows the synthesis process for silane precursor function-
alized with TEMPO moiety named “TEMPO@DE” [202] . In the first
step, the addition of 3-aminopropyl(trimethoxy) silane to a 4-oxo-
3 CN  (95%)  in  MeOH  resulted  in  an  organosi-
TEMPO  and  NaBH
lane precursor solution. Then, the coated electrode was obtained
through stirring a solution containing organosilane precursor so-
lution,  methyltrimethoxysilane,  ethanol  and  a  buffer  solution  at
pH  4  in  the  presence  of  constant  negative  potential  of  1.1 V  vs.
Ag/AgCl. The electrode can be fabricated with the favorable surface
hydrophilicity-lipophilicity balance (HLB) where its positive effects
were illustrated by its impact on the oxidation of alcohols in water
and inhibition of overoxidation to acids. The TEMPO@DE electrode
exhibited excellent selectivity (99%) and good conversion (87%) for
cinnamyl alcohol (24S) oxidation affording cinnamaldehyde as the
primary product [195] . Despite the advantages associated with use
of TEMPO@DE electrode (in terms of high stability and reusabil-
ity), the process suffers from prolonged reaction times (e.g., 90 h
for cinnamyl alcohol oxidation) caused by the low surface area of
electrodes and amorphous nature of the organosilica layer.

Development  of  electrodes  that  provide  high  accessibility  to
the active sites can be achieved using ordered mesoporous silica
with  the  desirable  pore  size.  The  electro-assisted  self-assembly
method  [203]  was  reported  to  prepare  ordered  mesoporous
silica  films  consisting  of  hexagonally  packed  channels  of  the

lignin model 1S resulted in complete and selective oxidation of the
primary hydroxyl groups.

mesoporous  molecular  sieve,  MCM-41  [204]  (Mobil  composition
of  matter  number  forty-one),  perpendicular  to  the  electrode
surface.  Desirable  pore  size  and  channel  orientation  are  two
challenging parameters in this approach. The silica channels func-
tionalized with TEMPO afforded a high conversion for benzylic and
allylic substrates [205] . Recently, there has been a surge of interest
in  utilizing  nanoparticles  for  alcohol  oxidation  owing  to  their
high surface area resulting in high activity under mild conditions.
Swiech and co-workers [206] developed a new electrode using the
gold nanoparticles decorated by TEMPO with well-defined cover-
age and narrow size distribution. The catalytic ability of fabricated
electrode was evaluated for oxidation of benzyl alcohol in anhy-
drous  acetonitrile  and  in  the  presence  of  2,6-lutidine  as  a  base.
Compared to the TEMPO monolayer electrode with no nanoparticle
participating, the TEMPO-gold coated electrode was more efficient
for electrocatalytic oxidation, in which its catalytic current was 20
times greater than that for the TEMPO coated electrode [206] .

Recently,  Stahl  and  Rafiee  [125]  employed  an  electrochemi-
cal  catalytic  oxidation  method  using  TEMPO  to  selectively  oxi-
dized  primary  hydroxyl  groups  on  β–O–4  linkage  to  carboxylic
acids  while  the  secondary  hydroxyl  groups  remained  unchanged
( Fig.  22 ).  The  oxidation  afforded  polycarboxylated  lignin  in  the
form  of  a  polymeric  β-hydroxy  acid.  Using  this  method  lignin
model  17S  (as  a  monomeric  1 ° alcohol  model)  completely  con-
verted to acid (67P). Similarly, the oxidation of the dimeric β–O–4

Diversity  in  lignin  structure  is  the  most  critical  challenge  in
lignin oxidation. Presence of different linkages and aliphatic alco-
hols  in  lignin  structure  affects  the  types  and  yields  of  products.
TEMPO oxidation approaches have mostly been applied on lignin
models.  Therefore,  effective  oxidation  methods  for  actual  lignin
streams still need to be developed.

9.2. Chemoselectivity

High levels of chemoselectivity are desired in lignin oxidation,
but selective oxidation of one alcohol in lignin structure is a chal-
lenge. Targeting aldehydes, the major challenge for the oxidation of
primary hydroxyl groups over secondary ones is to avoid overoxi-
dation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids that results in reduced cat-
alyst turnovers and consequently a low conversation of the sub-
strate. Understanding the interaction between TEMPO with either
other  catalytic  components  presents  in  the  reaction  medium  or
with lignin is difficult. The overoxidized products have also been
reported for other polysaccharide materials such as cellulose [207–
209] .  In  order  to  give  readers  insights  into  the  overoxidation  of
aldehydes to carboxylic acids, the following explanations provide
a brief summary of TEMPO oxidation of cellulose to afford overox-
idized products.

9.2.1. Cellulose oxidation

The conversion mechanism of primary hydroxyl groups of cellu-
lose to carboxylates via aldehydes using TEMPO/NaBr/NaClO cata-
lyst system is presented in Fig. 23 . The oxidation process proceeds

Fig. 23.  Regioselective oxidation of C6 primary hydroxyls of cellulose to C6 carboxylate groups by TEMPO/NaBr/NaClO oxidation in water at pH 10–11 (Adapted from Ref.
[207] with permission of Royal Society of Chemistry).

under alkaline condition and primary hydroxyl groups are oxidized
to carboxyl groups through C6-aldehydes. In the case of native cel-
lulose crystals, the oxidation resulted in the conversion of primary
hydroxyl groups to carboxylate groups while the crystallinity was
maintained  and  no  water-soluble  products  were  observed.  Com-
pared  to  native  cellulose,  regenerated  and  mercerized  celluloses
are more reactive toward TEMPO oxidation owing to their lower
crystallinity index [210] . Almost all C6 primary alcohol groups pre-
sented in regenerated cellulose, i.e., the cellulose II allomorph, are
oxidized to carboxyl groups, resulting in water-soluble β-(1,4)-d-
polyglucuronic acid, named cellouronic acid [211–213] .

Cellouronic acid prepared by TEMPO/NaBr/NaClO at pH 10 often
have  a  very  low  weight-average  degree  of  polymerization  (DP w )
[207] . For example, cellouronic acid with DP w of 40 was obtained
from oxidation of Bemliese regenerated cellulose [209] . Applied to
the  same  cellulose,  4-acetamide-TEMPO/NaClO/NaClO
2  system  at
pH 4.8–6.8 afforded cellouronic acid with higher DP w values rang-
ing from 220 to 490 [209] . Low DP of oxidized samples especially
under an alkaline condition can be attributed to the depolymer-
ization phenomenon due to  over oxidation  of  glucosyl repeating
units. Oxidation at secondary hydroxyl groups increases the chance
for β-elimination reactions and results in the cleavage of glycosidic
bonds [210,212,214] .

9.3. Separation

The separation of products from the reaction mixture is a ma-
jor concern that needs to be addressed in future. In general, sep-
aration in heterogeneous systems is simpler than that in homoge-
neous catalyst systems [215] . It has been reported that the func-
tionalized  TEMPO  can  probably  make  the  separation  step  easier
[188] .

9.4. Implementation of novel methods

In  addition  to  the  conventional  catalysts  for  lignin  oxidation,
the novel methods, such as implementation of IL, immobilization
of TEMPO onto different supports (e.g., polymers), and electrocata-
lyst oxidation deserve adequate consideration for lignin oxidation.
However,  there  is  insufficient  data  on  the  use  of  these  systems
on lignin oxidation, and further studies are emphatically recom-
mended. Use of IL offers many benefits; one of them is the rela-
tively easy recovery of the final products. ILs are good candidates

for  immobilization  of  catalytic  compounds.  The  affinity  of  such
compounds  towards  IL  can  be  enhanced  by  tuning  the  polarity
of IL.

9.5. Yield and price

Despite  the  great  studies  on  lignin’s  potential  for  producing
valuable  materials,  concerns  regarding  yield  and  price  of  prod-
ucts obtained from lignin modification and depolymerization ham-
per the extension of processes to commercial scales. The available
studies on the oxidation of lignin models showed that the products
can be obtained in reasonable yields, while oxidation of technical
lignin affords a low yield of low molecular-weight components (as
mentioned in Table 8 ). Oxidation of technical lignin is an active
area  of  research  that  shows  a  path  for  further  studies.  As  a  re-
sult, more scientific and technological developments are required
for making lignin oxidation industrially worthwhile.

10. Conclusions

Lignin is available in a large quantity from numerous pulping
and biorefinery industries. In order to functionalize and transform
lignin to value-added green products, TEMPO catalytic oxidation is
a promising method that converts lignin into small molecules or
macro-monomers. An efficient TEMPO catalytic oxidation of lignin
results in a high yield of a target chemical. The results from de-
polymerization of diols with ether and C –C bonds at C( β) position
are proposed to forecast the reactivity of authentic industrial lignin
samples, providing an important foundation for future efforts fo-
cused on selective cleavage reactions of technical lignins by TEMPO
depolymerization.

Regardless of the types of lignin structure, TEMPO-copper cat-
alytic systems have shown strong affinity for C –C and C –O bond
cleavage of a variety of lignin structures. In contrast, the metal-free
systems are often used for lignin functionalization. As described,
co-catalysts  and  ligands  play  vital  roles  in  enhancement  of  the
conversion  rates.  Most  reactions  of  TEMPO  catalytic  systems  are
conducted at temperatures not higher than 100 °C, which can be
counted as an advantage. It has been stated that the chemoselec-
tivity can be tailored by pH adjustment. The oxidation of primary
hydroxyl groups over secondary ones or vice versa has also been
reported.  Electrochemical  oxidation  is  highly  desirable,  in  which
the generation of waste can be prevented. Promising results have

been achieved in the electrocatalytic oxidation of lignin monomer
using TEMPO-functionalized electrode.

The  approaches  developed  for  lignin  valorization  have  been
vastly improved over past years, opening new avenues towards the
production  of  platform  molecules.  Undoubtedly,  close  collabora-
tions between academic and industry scientists are needed to over-
come the present obstacles hindering the practicability of TEMPO
oxidation of lignin.
