Worldwide emphasis on fuel efficiency, low emissions, and use of low-quality fuels such as biogas con-
tinues to drive the development of combustors that operate over a wider range of fuel/air ratios and with
higher burning velocities than their conventional counterparts. Enhancement of reaction rates is required
to increase burning velocities and widen fuel/air operating ranges over values achievable in conventional
combustors, and extensive research over the last few decades has shown that transferring heat in a re-
actor from hot combustion products to incoming reactants can accomplish this enhancement without
external energy addition. These reactors, called heat recirculating reactors, use various geometries and
flow strategies to optimize the heat transfer. In this paper, research on heat recirculating reactors is re-
viewed with an emphasis on the most important designs and applications. The basic characteristics of a
heat recirculating reactor are encompassed in a simple configuration: a flame stabilized in a tube with
high thermal conductivity. More complex designs that have evolved to further optimize heat transfer and
recirculation are then described, including porous reactors with or without flame stabilization and chan-
nel reactors consisting of parallel tubes or slots. Advanced designs introduce additional means of heat
transfer, such as transverse heat transfer from hot products through channel walls to incoming reactants,
thereby leading to the counter-flow channel reactor. The flexibility of heat recirculating reactors to op-
erate on a variety of fuels and over wide operating ranges has led to many applications including fuel
reformers, radiant heaters and thermal oxidizers, and important work on these applications is reviewed.
Finally, future research directions are discussed.

1. Introduction

The  importance  of  heat  transfer  to  premixed  combustion  is
firmly established in both theory and practice, often defining the
nature of the combustion process or whether it will occur at all.
This basic principle was established by Mallard and Le Chatelier
[1] who proposed that self-sustaining combustion of a premixed
fuel/air reactant mixture was achieved by the transfer of heat from
the flame zone such that the unburned mixture was brought up to
the  ignition  temperature.  Their  groundbreaking  work  resulted  in
a simple expression showing that burning rate, or flame speed, is
positively related to thermal diffusivity. In this simple model of a
laminar flame, the thermal diffusivity of the gas, which determines
the gas phase heat transfer, is set by the particular fuel/oxidizer
mixture  and  cannot  be  altered  to  enhance  flame  characteristics.
The reaction rate, however, can be changed by heat transfer into
or out of a reactant mixture, thereby increasing or decreasing the
reactant temperature and altering the reaction rate. As a result, the
flammability limits of the reactant mixture can be broadened or
narrowed [2–4] . Explosion limits are also a function of heat trans-
fer; an explosion is produced when heat transfer raises the temper-
ature of a fuel/oxidizer mixture such that heat release from run-
away exothermic reactions is greater than heat loss. Heat transfer
also plays a critical role in flame quenching when heat loss from
the reaction zone overwhelms heat release, thus resulting in extin-
guishment of the chemical reactions [5] .

These fundamental theories demonstrate that heat transfer into
and out of the reaction zone has the potential for profound effects
on  combustion  characteristics.  Enhancing  heat  transfer  from  hot
combustion gases to lower temperature reactants can be achieved
by exposing the combustion gases to solid surfaces, which provide
an effective conductive and radiative pathway to transfer heat from
hot combustion products to relatively cold reactants. This idea has
given rise to heat recirculating reactors, which are purposely de-
signed to use solid surfaces to enhance the heat transfer from the
reaction zone to the unburned reactants [6,7] .

within  the  conventional  flammability  limits  (Regime  I),  heat  ad-
dition  is  not  necessary  for  combustion  stability  although  it  may
enhance the burning rate. As the mixture approaches the lean or
rich  flammability  limit  (Regime  II),  the  flame  becomes  less  sta-
ble, which is unsuitable in practical applications, and these mix-
tures  benefit  from  heat  addition  to  enhance  flame  stability.  Be-
yond the flammability limits, a flame is not self-sustaining because
the exothermic reactions cannot overcome heat losses (Regime III).
Heat addition in this regime must produce reaction temperatures
above  the  temperature  predicted  by  equilibrium  (superadiabatic
temperatures) in order for combustion to be sustained.

2 ) and water (H

Heat recirculating reactors may operate within the conventional
flammability  limits  or  beyond  these  limits,  in  the  ultra-lean  or
ultra-rich regimes. Reactors operating in each of these equivalence
ratio  regimes  have  different  applications  as  described  in  Fig.  2 ,
which shows a distribution of the adiabatic and constant pressure
equilibrium products for methane/air at different equivalence ra-
tios  calculated  using  Cantera  [9] .  Combustors  may  operate  near
stoichiometry  where  thermal  energy  output  per  unit  of  reactant
mixture  is  maximized  and  major  products  include  carbon  diox-
ide (CO
2 O). There are practical advantages to op-
erating near the lean flammability limit for low emissions of both
carbon  monoxide  (CO)  and  nitric  oxide  (NO).  Thermal  oxidizers,
which have applications in emissions control, operate beyond the
lean flammability limit in the ultra-lean regime where significant
amounts  of  oxygen  (O
2 )  are  in  the  reactants
2 )  and  nitrogen  (N
and only trace amounts of fuel are available. The ultimate goal of
a  lean-burning reactor  is  robust  operation  in  terms  of  operating
range while minimizing emissions such as NO, CO and unburned
hydrocarbons (UHC). On the rich side of stoichiometry, near and
beyond the rich flammability limit, the reactor is a fuel reformer
2 ),
and converts the fuel to syngas consisting of CO, hydrogen (H
and other products. Since performance is driven by heat transfer
rather than catalytic reactions, heat recirculating reactors tend to
be fuel flexible, operating similarly with different fuels and insen-
sitive to fuel impurities.

1.1. Fundamental principle of heat recirculating reactors

1.2. Important parameters for design and performance

The basic principle behind heat recirculating reactors is that en-
ergy is recycled from the flame to the reactants to increase the re-
actant temperature such that reactions will proceed at enhanced
rates, without any energy addition from an external source. One of
the interesting features of heat recirculating reactors is the possi-
bility that maximum temperatures may exceed those predicted by
chemical equilibrium [6] . This gave rise to the terms superadiabatic
or excess enthalpy combustion and presented the possibility of two
other distinct but related phenomena: stable combustion of fuels
at equivalence ratios significantly beyond conventional flammabil-
ity limits [6–8] , and flame speeds that exceed the laminar flame
speed. It is important to note that the terms superadiabatic or ex-
cess enthalpy refer to local quantities, i.e. the maximum peak tem-
perature or enthalpy may exceed that of an adiabatic flame with-
out heat recirculation, but the overall energy balance as restricted
by the first law remains unchanged.

The impact of heat addition varies according to the equivalence
ratio of the mixture, as shown in Fig. 1 . At equivalence ratios well

Heat recirculating reactors are based on the concept of an em-
bedded flame, i.e. the flame is stabilized within and not at the sur-
face of the reactor. This characteristic distinguishes these reactors
from those in which combustion takes place at the exit of a tube
and places a number of limits on design and operating parameters,
described by the Damköhler number ( Da ), quenching Peclet num-
ber ( Pe q ), dimensionless heat loss ratio (  ̃ H ), and Reynolds number

f and τ c are the residence and chemical times scales, re-
where τ
spectively; L and U are the reactor length and inlet velocity, respec-
tively; S L , d q and α are the laminar flame speed, quenching diame-
ter, and thermal diffusivity, respectively; h E is the convective heat
transfer coefficient between the external surface and the environ-
ment and h I is the convective heat transfer coefficient between in-
ternal surfaces and the gas; A E and A I are the external and internal
areas for heat transfer, respectively; and d p and v are the pore di-
ameter or channel height and the kinematic viscosity of the gas,
respectively.

Gas residence time, dependent upon reactor length and reactant
velocity, is highly influential in whether an embedded flame can be
sustained in a reactor. The required reactor length and maximum
reactant velocity is suggested by Da , as an embedded flame is able
to exist when its chemical reaction time is smaller than the reac-
tor residence time ( Da (cid:3)1). There is no minimum reactor length L
for infinitely fast kinetics ( Da = ∞ ), so it is important to consider

finite rate kinetics when developing a reactor design; for example,
accommodation of finite rate kinetics is critical for fuel reforming
where relatively slow reactions are significant contributors to the
production of hydrogen ( Section 4.4 ). Limits on reactant velocity
are reflected in Re limits, which define the stability characteristics
of the reactor; at low Re heat losses overwhelm heat release and
the flame extinguishes, and at high Re the flame blows off due to
insufficient residence time ( Da (cid:5)1) [10] . Re also specifies the flow
regime; heat recirculating reactors generally operate either in the
laminar regime or the transitional regime, where modeling of tur-
bulence becomes important [11] .

The pore diameter or channel height is an important param-
eter for embedded flames because the solid surfaces can lead to
quenching of the flames, as described by Pe q . With typical quench-
ing  distances  on  the  order  of  millimeters  and  flame  speeds  of
10–50 cm/s depending on equivalence ratio, typical Pe q values for
flames in tubes or channels are in the range of 10 to 60 [12,13] and

provide guidance on minimum length scales for reactor design. Pe q
is  also  relevant  for  flame  stabilization  in  porous  media  burners;
it has been shown that quenching occurs when a flame interacts
with a cold porous medium if Pe q < ∼ 65 [14] , so flame stabiliza-
tion within porous media can be achieved at the interface of two
sections of porous media with different characteristic length scales
as in a two-section burner ( Section 2.2.2 )

As  for  all  combustion  devices,  heat  losses  substantially  affect
operating limits. Solid surfaces provide a means of internal heat
recirculation but also provide pathways for heat loss to the envi-
ronment at the external boundaries. The balance between external
losses and internal recirculation highlights a challenge of heat re-
circulating reactor design and operation, which is to maintain the
ratio   ̃ H  as small as possible. The defining characteristic of inter-
nal heat recirculation is achieved through convective heat transfer
between gas and solid phases, conduction within the solid and ra-
diation between solid surfaces. The relative roles of convection and
conduction in sustaining embedded flames can be characterized by
a Biot number

where k s is the solid conductivity and L c is a characteristic length
scale for a given reactor geometry (e.g. L c has been given as 2 L 2 / t
for a counter-flowing reactor, where L is the channel length and
t is the wall thickness [15] ). B has different implications for dif-
ferent  designs.  For  a  reactor  with  counterflowing  channels,  the
main  mode  of  heat  transfer  is  through  the  walls  and  transverse
to  the  flow  direction,  and  streamwise  conduction  is  less  impor-
tant, or even detrimental, so a maximized value of B is optimal.
For example, a counterflow reactor with infinitely thin walls divid-
ing the channels would have B → ∞ . For a reactor with co-flowing
channels,  however,  the  only  means  of  heat  transfer  upstream  is
through axial conduction  and radiation and subsequent solid-to-
gas heat transfer, so a finite value of B is necessary for optimal
performance.

Performance of the heat recirculating reactors is characterized

by the non-dimensional temperature,   ̃ T  and velocity,   ̃ U

where T max and T
ad are the local maximum temperature in the re-
actor and the adiabatic flame temperature for the reactant mixture,
respectively. These two parameters describe the enhancement of
the combustion process over that of an adiabatic premixed laminar

flame; values of nondimensional temperature and velocity greater
than  unity  indicate  superadiabatic  or  enhanced  combustion.  For
example,   ̃ T  has been predicted and measured at 2.3 for a filtra-
tion reactor operating on a methane/air mixture with an equiva-
lence ratio of 0.15 [16,17] . Similarly,   ̃ U  gives a measure of burning
velocity relative to the adiabatic laminar flame speed for a spe-
cific fuel/oxidizer mixture. This ratio is a measure of the burning
rate enhancement over that of a conventional laminar flame and is
typically in the range of 2 to 5, though these values are still signif-
icantly lower than turbulent flames speeds with enhancements of
over 20 times the laminar flame speed [18] .

1.3. Operating regimes of heat recirculating reactors

In  early  work,  Jones  et  al.  [7]  proposed  many  different  con-
cepts to enhance the heat recirculation in a reactor. Most of the
research since then, however, has focused on a few major designs
which are dominated by different flow and heat transfer processes
( Fig.  3 ).  One  of  the  simplest  designs  is  a  reactor  made  of  two-
sections of porous media, a bundle of tubes, or parallel channels.
Heat is recirculated by axial conduction through the solid and ra-
diation between solid surfaces, and the operating range is in mod-
erate equivalence ratios. Filtration reactors, typically a single sec-
tion of porous media, are more complex in that the reaction front
propagates relative to the solid. In a frame of reference fixed to a
downstream-propagating reaction front, the hot solid moves into
the reaction zone and is an additional mode of heat recirculation
as described by Babkin [19] . These reactors are capable of oper-
ation at moderate-to-extreme rich and lean equivalence ratios. In
contrast  to  these  reactors,  which  utilize  unidirectional  flow  and
heat transfer, a third type of reactor is the counter-flow reactor in
which the gas flows in opposite directions in neighboring chan-
nels. In counter-flow reactors, there is an additional mechanism of
transverse heat transfer through the walls. These reactors are capa-
ble of operation near and beyond flammability limits. In this paper,
we focus on these major designs, the principles of operation, and
applications.

1.4. Scope of this review

Many review articles on heat recirculating reactors have been
published,  the  first  in  1995  by  Howell  et  al.  [20] ,  which  pro-
vided  an  overview  of  work  in  porous  media  combustion.  Since
then, more specific reviews have focused on lean combustion in
porous  reactors  [21] ,  production  of  syngas  [22] ,  practical  appli-
cations  [23,24] ,  microcombustion  [25] ,  modeling  of  porous  me-
dia  combustion  [26] ,  and  combustion  of  liquid  fuels  in  porous

to consider porous media reactors as well as other non-catalytic
heat recirculating designs and a variety of applications.  The im-
portant  underlying  mechanisms  of  major  reactor  designs  based

ies  published  since  the  last  review  articles  on  this  topic  are

2. Unidirectional flow reactors

In a unidirectional flow reactor, the bulk flow of the gas is in
one direction and the solid surfaces provide conduction and radia-
tion pathways for heat transfer upstream from hot products to cold
reactants ( Fig. 4 ). Solids, especially porous media such as packed
beds or reticulated foams, generate axial and transverse dispersion
of mass and energy through the open-cell structure, which is an-
other heat transfer enhancement pathway [28,29] .

2.1. Operating principle of unidirectional flow reactor

The fundamental principle of unidirectional reactors is that the
heat release produces a locally high temperature in the gas that
is  greater  than  that  of  the  surrounding  solid  ( Fig.  5 ).  Heat  is
transferred from the gas to the solid and subsequently upstream
through conduction and solid-to-solid radiation, producing an up-
stream solid temperature that is greater than the surrounding gas.
Heat is then transferred from the solid to the gas, thereby preheat-
ing it without any external addition of energy.

The  basic  concept  of  a  unidirectional  heat  recirculating  reac-
tor can be demonstrated by a one-dimensional model of a flame
in  a  single  tube  with  convective  internal  and  external  boundary
conditions  as  well  as  axial  conductive  heat  transfer  through  the
wall.  Critical  insights  gained  from  one-dimensional  studies,  and
confirmed  by  experimental  studies,  include  the  observation  that
burning speeds greater than the adiabatic laminar flame speed pre-
dicted by one-dimensional laminar flame theory can be achieved,
flammability limits can be extended, and combustion can be sus-
tained at tube diameters less than the classical quenching distance
[30,31] . Additional insights gained from these models highlight the
impact of wall properties and heat loss on stability of near-limit
flames. Thus, one-dimensional modeling captures many of the fun-
damental aspects of heat recirculating reactors.

Additional important insights into flame stabilization have been
gained by two-dimensional modeling of combustion in tubes. No-
tably, the burning rates of a flame in a tube were investigated by
Gauthier  et  al.  [32,33]  who  developed  a  two-dimensional  model
using  the  Navier–Stokes  equations  for  low  Mach  number  react-
ing flows including the effects of solid conduction and solid-to-gas
heat transfer. Their results showed burning rate enhancement is at-
tributed to two factors: increased flame surface area over that of a
one-dimensional flame and preheating of the incoming gases. Their
calculations of flame surface area as a function of non-dimensional
in , equivalent to   ̃ U  defined in Section 1.2 , for var-
inlet velocity, U
ious  non-dimensional  tube  diameters  is  shown  in  Fig.  6 a.  These
computations represent an idealized case of combustion and heat
recirculation because external heat loss, which could significantly
reduce flame velocities, was not included. For small inflow veloci-
in < 1), the non-dimensional flame areas are all close to one,
ties ( U
indicating  that  those  flames  are  nearly  flat.  As  inlet  velocity  in-
creases, the surface area increases. Larger diameter tubes show a
stronger effect with a tube of 2.46 times the quenching distance
exhibiting flame areas up to six times those of a flat flame. The

dimensionless burning velocity per unit area, U
f = 1, the flame
inlet velocity is shown in Fig. 6 (b). At a value of U
velocity  per  unit  of  flame  area  is  the  same  as  that  for  a  one-
dimensional flame. For large diameter tubes ( d
f is close
d q
to one for all inlet velocities indicating that the increase in burn-
ing velocity, U
in , is due to the increase in flame area rather than
due  to  enhanced  reaction  rate  brought  about  by  preheating.  For
smaller diameter tubes, the flame velocity per unit area is as high
as 2 times that for a flat laminar flame. In these tubes, heat recir-
culation due to the solid walls is an important factor in enhancing
the burning velocity.

Both conduction and solid-to-solid radiation are important con-
tributors to heat transfer in a heat-recirculating tube reactor [34] .
Hackert  et  al.  [12]  included  both  solid  conduction  and  radiation
in two-dimensional simulations of a flame in a radially insulated
cylindrical tube of diameter 1.1 mm. Fig. 7 shows predictions of the
effect of solid conductivity and emissivity on the burning rate of
a methane/air mixture with an equivalence ratio of 0.6. Increasing
the conductivity from 5 to 15  W

crease in burning rate. Increasing the emissivity had a more mod-
est effect, particularly for values greater than 0.1. Radiation exiting
the tube, important for applications to radiant heating, is similarly
sensitive to conductivity and emissivity.

To  better  understand  flame  stabilization  in  burners  like
these, some researchers have investigated flame stabilization and

dynamics in heated channels with length scales on the order of
or  smaller  than  the  quenching  distance  [25,35–37] .  Various  dy-
namic and steady phenomena have been observed [25,38,39] and
predicted by models [36,40–42] , including the complex phenom-
ena of FREI (flames with repetitive extinction and ignition). As de-
scribed by Nakamura et al. [36] , FREI was observed when reactants
flowed through a small heated channel; when a sufficiently high
gas temperature was reached, combustion initiated and the flame
propagated in both directions until extinction, and then the pro-
cess restarted as fresh reactants flowed through the heated chan-
nel.  In  addition  to  FREI,  researchers  have  reported  a  variety  of
other stable and unstable flame types such as cool flames, pulsat-
ing flames, stable symmetric and asymmetric flames, and mixed
modes of these flame types [37] . Though the surfaces of the re-
actors  were  heated  externally  in  these  experiments  and  models,
in contrast to heat-recirculating reactors which have no external
heat addition, the flame behavior observed can take place in heat-
recirculating reactors since many of these devices are composed of
channels or pores with dimensions on the order of the quench-
ing distance and with an axial temperature gradient. An example
is the oscillatory behavior in a two-section heat recirculating re-
actor ( Section 2.2.2 ) described by Vogel and Ellzey [43] . At the ex-
treme operating conditions for this reactor, the reaction zone prop-
agated upstream into the cold porous solid and extinguished at the
interface between the highly porous downstream solid and a less
porous solid upstream as heat losses overcame heat release. After
the reaction extinguished, fresh reactants filtered through the hot
solid and reignited, beginning the process again, and an analogy
with FREI behavior in heated channels [44] was noted.

2.2. Unidirectional reactor designs

Practical  designs  of  unidirectional  reactors  include  multiple
tubes  with  either  solid  walls  or  an  open  pore  structure.  These
solid geometries are generically referred to as porous media. Fig. 8
shows  the  various  unidirectional  flow  reactor  designs  that  have
been studied, including a bundle of tubes or stacked channels, a
single section of open-cell porous media, or two sections of porous
media stacked one on the other.

2.2.1. Reactors with self-stabilizing flames

Reactors  such  as  those  shown  in  Fig.  8 (a)  and  (b),  consisting
of a single section of channels or reticulated media, do not have
internal flame arrestors. Consequently, the flame stabilizes at the
point where the burning velocity balances the incoming flow, re-
sulting in different flame locations for different operating condi-
tions. Weak flames will tend to stabilize nearer the center of the
burner where radiative losses out the exit are smaller and stronger
flames will stabilize closer to the exit [45] .

A single section reactor was explored theoretically by Takeno
et al. [46,47] who predicted burning velocities much greater than
the laminar flame speed and extended flammability limits. Subse-
quent experimental work confirmed the attainment of high burn-
ing rates as well as stable combustion beyond the lean flamma-
bility limit [48] . These effects were attributed to the enhanced ax-
ial conduction provided by the porous media that recirculated heat
from the flame zone to the incoming mixture. Later modeling stud-
ies showed the importance of solid radiation [49] . Similar to the
results of earlier research [47,48] , Hackert et al. [12] concluded that
the dominant heat transfer mechanism was axial conduction.

An  example  of  a  well-characterized  unidirectional  reactor  is
the ceramic honeycomb combustor studied by Min and Shin [50] .
Their combustor was 76 mm in diameter with a cell density of 400
square cells per square inch, a cell hydraulic diameter of 1.1 mm,
and an overall porosity of 75%. In comparison to random porous
matrices,  the  geometry  of  this  combustor  was  simple  and  well-
defined honeycomb which made it amenable to theoretical anal-
ysis. Experimental results showed   ̃ U  up to 4.5, and a modest ex-
tension of the lean flammability limit. Though experimental data
for separate gas and solid temperatures are not often presented for
these burners due to the difficulty of measurement, Min and Shin
obtained gas and solid temperatures by cutting a slit of 1.1 mm in
the axial direction of the burner and measuring the solid temper-
ature  in  the  cell  next  to  the  slit  ( Fig.  9 ).  The  measured  profiles
show the fundamental characteristics of a heat recirculating reac-
tor: a peak gas temperature greater than the adiabatic flame tem-
perature (  ̃ T ≈ 1 . 15 ), downstream gas temperature greater than the
solid  temperature,  and  upstream  solid  temperature  greater  than
the gas temperature. Computations, which included heat losses to
the environment, showed good agreement with experiment. Simi-
larly, Schoegl and Ellzey [45] confirmed these essential character-
istics using a simplified analytical model of combustion in parallel
channels.

Fig. 10.  Computed isotherms for a flame in a 13-channel parallel plate burner in-
cluding external heat losses. Flow is from left to right. Plate separation is 0.55 mm
and wall thickness is 0.17 mm. The upstream isotherm is 400 K and the far down-
stream isotherm is 1450 K. Maximum isotherm is 1800 K. Predicted burning speed
is 62.8 cm/s at equivalence of 0.6 for methane/air compared to ∼12 cm/s for lam-
inar flame speed using same simplified chemistry (Reprinted from Hackert et al.
[12] with permission of Elsevier).

Min  and  Shin  [50]  also  examined  soot  lines  formed  in  the
burner to determine flame location and curvature. The center of
the  flames  that  were  stabilized  entirely  within  the  burner  were
one-dimensional except near the wall where heat losses resulted
in curvature. Further details of the flame shape were elucidated by
the numerical modeling of this burner by Hackert et al. [12] . In
cases where heat losses to the exterior were included, the individ-
ual flames stabilized at different locations along the tube. Fig. 10
shows the results of a simulation of 13 parallel plate channels with
a separation of 0.55 mm and wall thickness of 0.17 mm. For chan-
nels near the exterior, there is more external radial heat loss and
the flame stabilizes closer to the center where there is less radia-
tive heat loss from the ends of the channels. These results show
that the flames are two-dimensional on two different scales: the
individual flames within the channels are elongated and the overall
flame in the burner is curved, which indicates heat loss via transfer
in the transverse direction from the inner tubes where heat losses
are minimum to the outer tubes where heat loss is maximum.

The  relationships  between  heat  recirculation,  heat  loss,  flash-
back  and  blowoff for  a  large-aspect  ratio  microreactor  partially
filled with a porous medium were studied by Li et al. [51] . The sta-
bility limits (blowoff and flashback) were described for lean mix-
tures of H
2 and air in terms of the ratio of preheating to heat loss,
which was calculated using the heat transfer in the location up-
stream of the reaction zone and within the reaction zone defined
as the region bounded by the 5% and 95% H
2 contours. Stable re-
action was observed for an equivalence ratio down to 0.35 when
the ratio of preheating to heat loss was the maximum calculated
value of 9, and the ratio of preheating to heat loss increased with
decreasing equivalence ratio. The results of this study illustrate the
importance of low   ̃ H for stable combustion of mixtures with equiv-
alence ratios far from stoichiometry.

2.2.2. Reactors with flame stabilization

Early papers on combustion in channel reactors led to signifi-
cant work in the research and development of reactors filled with
porous media. One obstacle to practical utility of these burners was
the tendency of the flame to propagate slowly through the porous
medium.  Consequently,  significant  work  has  focused  on  holding
the  flame  in  a  fixed  position  or  region. With  this  idea  in  mind,
Hsu et al. [52] proposed a new design consisting of two sections
of porous media: an upstream section with small pores through
which the flame could not propagate followed by a section with
larger  pores  in  which  conductive  and  radiative  heat  transfer  re-

from Mathis and Ellzey [55] ).

circulated energy ( Fig. 8 (c)). Both experimental and computational
research has confirmed that this design is successful at stabilizing
the flame at or near the interface between the two sections [53–
58] . In these designs, the upstream section has pores sizes such
that d <  d q and Pe < Pe q which halts potential upstream propaga-
tion and stabilizes combustion in the downstream section. Fig. 11
shows the temperature profiles at various operating conditions for
a burner consisting of two sections of reticulated ceramic foam: an
upstream section with 23.6 pores per centimeter (ppcm) followed
by  a  downstream  section  with  3.9  ppcm  [55] .  The  interface  be-
tween the two sections is at x = 5 cm, and the results clearly show
the effectiveness of the small pores at stabilizing the flame over a
range of inlet velocities from 15 to 75 cm/s, corresponding to firing
rates of 313 and 1563  kW
m 2 , respectively. These results demonstrate
a significant enhancement in burning speed achieved over the adi-
abatic laminar flame speed of 15.7 cm/s at an equivalence ratio of
0.65, with a maximum   ̃ U  of more than 4.5 at the highest tested
operating condition reported.

Unlike  some  other  heat  recirculating  reactors,  the  maximum
temperatures in a two-section reactor are at most only modestly
greater than the adiabatic flame temperature. Despite the enhance-
ment in burning rate observed in Fig. 11 , the maximum tempera-
ture is less than the adiabatic flame temperature of ∼1750 K for an
equivalence ratio of 0.65. Similar results of enhanced burning rates
with temperature below the adiabatic value ( Fig. 12 ) were found
by  Brenner  et  al.  [56]  who  conducted  experiments  and  compu-
tations including heat losses. For comparison, the adiabatic flame
temperature  for  methane/air  at  an  equivalence  ratio  of  0.90  is
∼2130 K. At a fixed equivalence ratio, the firing rate is increased
by increasing the inlet speed of the fuel/air mixture. At high fir-
ing rates, the relative losses to the surroundings are less and the
maximum temperature is close to but still less than the adiabatic
flame temperature. Conversion of the firing rates to velocities show
burning rate enhancement of greater than 6.5 at an equivalence ra-
tio of 0.67. Barra and Ellzey [53] modeled the two-section burner
of Smucker and Ellzey [54] consisting of reticulated foam with up-
stream and downstream pore densities of 60 and 10 ppi, respec-
tively.  Their  one-dimensional  model  included  full  kinetics,  solid
and  gas  conduction,  solid-to-solid  radiation,  and  interfacial  heat
transfer. Assuming no radial heat losses, the maximum tempera-
tures were 5% greater than the adiabatic flame temperature at an
equivalence ratio of 0.55, and 5% less at an equivalence ratio of
0.90.

Although maximum temperatures in the two-section burner do
not  typically  exceed  those  predicted  by  equilibrium  by  a  large

amount, superadiabatic performance is often attributed to this de-
sign due to the burning speeds, which can be significantly greater
than the laminar flame speed, as noted above. Using the model de-
veloped by Barra et al. [58] , Smucker and Ellzey [54] compared the
experimental and computational operating limits of a two-section
burner  operating  on  propane  ( Fig.  13 ).  The  laminar  flame  speed
is  lower  than  any  of  the  flow  velocity  limits  shown  for  opera-
tion in the porous burner. At the upper experimental limit mea-
sured  at  equivalence  ratio  of  0.65,  the  burning  velocity  is  more
than  7  times  the  laminar  flame  speed  at  that  condition.  Since
temperature measurements do not indicate superadiabatic values,
other  factors  must  influence  the  burning  rate.  Barra  and  Ellzey
[53] showed computationally that there was effective heat recir-
culation from the flame zone upstream to the preheat zone in a
two-section  burner  consisting  of  reticulated  foams  even  without
significant superadiabatic temperatures. Using results of their nu-
merical model, they predicted that as much as 25% of the energy
release was recirculated. In addition, an important characteristic of
flow in a reticulated foam is fluid dispersion arising from the tor-
tuous path a fluid particle must follow through the interconnected
pores. With a similar model, Henneke [59] showed that dispersion
significantly affects the maximum stable burning velocity in a re-
actor of reticulated foam with 3.9 pores per cm and a methane/air
mixture of equivalence ratio 0.7. Using two different correlations
from  the  literature  for  axial  dispersion,  the  maximum  burning

methane/air flame at an equivalence ratio of 0.6 in 50 mm burner consisting of up-
stream section of 3 mm packed balls followed by downstream section of ceramic
foam with different pore densities (10 ppi = 3.9 ppcm; 30 ppi = 11.8 ppcm). For
comparison, laminar flame speed of methane/air at equivalence ratio 0.6 is 11.7 cm/s

velocity  increased  by  approximately  20%,  or  68%  over  the  value
predicted with no dispersion. It is important to note that the mod-
els are one-dimensional using volume-averaged techniques and so
the details of the intra-pore flow and flame shape are not captured.
Further investigation of these characteristics might provide impor-
tant insights into the performance of two-section burners.

The  development  of  the  two-section  design  has  continued  to
evolve with a focus on various materials and pore characteristics
[55,60,61] .  The  pore  density  has  a  significant  effect  on  the  sta-
ble  operating  range  as  shown  in  Fig.  14 .  Larger  pore  density,  or
smaller pores, in the downstream section quench the flame more
readily and therefore limit the operating range. This is consistent
with quenching studies on flames in tubes [33,34] . The maximum
velocity of 70 cm/s represents a burning rate enhancement   ̃ U of ∼6.
Two-section porous reactors have been shown to operate effec-
tively on a wide variety of fuels including conventional gaseous fu-
els such as methane and propane [54,62,63] , liquid fuels [27,64,65] ,
and unconventional fuels like syngas [66] and biogas [67] . This fuel
flexibility is an advantage of using heat recirculation to enhance re-
action rates as compared to catalysts which often have restrictions
on operating conditions, fuel chemistry and fuel quality.

In addition to the two-section burner, other designs have been
proposed to stabilize the flame in a fixed region [22,24,68] . No-
tably,  several  researchers  have  designed  reactors  in  which  the
porous section was tapered such that the flow velocity decreased
with the wider cross-sectional area, effectively extending the op-
erating range [69,70] . Recently Song et al. [71] built a reactor with
porous media in an annular geometry which stabilized lean mix-
tures over a wide range of conditions. The tapered geometry, the
annular  geometry  and  the  two-section  geometry  were  recently
compared  experimentally  and  computationally  by  Bedoya  et  al.
[72] .  Based  on  their  experimental  results,  the  tapered  geometry
demonstrated the best performance in terms of operation beyond
the lean flammability limit and maximum burning enhancement   ̃ U
of ∼10 as compared to ∼5 and ∼3 for the two-section and radial
burners, respectively.

2.2.3. Filtration reactors

A  single-section  porous  reactor  in  which  the  reaction  zone
propagates is called a filtration reactor. This design contrasts with
the two-section reactor in which an intentional design feature is
the stabilization of the flame in a fixed position within the reactor.

Fig. 15.  Heat transfer processes in filtration combustion.

Though a reaction zone in a filtration reactor can remain in a fixed
position, the location is not stable; changes in flow rate or mix-
ture composition will cause the reaction zone to propagate relative
to the solid. The inherently transient nature of filtration combus-
tion sets it apart from the other heat-recirculating reactors, which
can operate indefinitely. The complex heat transfer processes are
described in Fig. 15 , which shows a generic filtration reactor. Af-
ter an initial startup period, a reaction zone establishes within the
porous solid. The downstream solid is hot from combustion prod-
ucts and the upstream solid is cool from incoming reactants. Heat
transfers upstream from the reaction zone by solid conduction and
radiation, and reactants are preheated by the solid as they near
the reaction zone. This heat transfer mechanism is shared with ax-
ial flow reactors in which the reaction zone does not propagate. In
a filtration reactor, however, the reaction zone is not constrained,
and propagation relative to the solid provides an additional heat
transfer  mechanism  that  is  not  present  in  other  types  of  heat-
recirculating reactors in which the reaction zone is stabilized [19] .
If the flow velocity is greater than the burning velocity, the com-
bustion front propagates downstream into the hot solid, and heat
is transferred from the solid to the gas. If the flow velocity is less
than the burning velocity, then the reaction zone propagates up-
stream into the cold solid, and heat is transferred from the gas to
the solid.

As described by Babkin [19] , the transient operation can take
many  forms,  which  are  generally  described  by  the  propagation
speed  of  the  reaction  zone,  u o ,  within  the  porous  medium:
a  low-velocity  regime  ( u o ∼= 10 − 4  m/s),  a  high-velocity  regime
( u o ∼= 10 m/s),  a  sound  velocity  regime  ( u o ∼= 10 2  m/s),  a  low-
velocity detonation ( u o = 800 − 1500 m/s) and a normal detonation
with losses ( u o = 1500 − 2000 m/s). The differences between these
regimes have been well-characterized [14,19,73] along with transi-
tion between the regimes [74,75] . Studies on the various regimes
and the controlling parameters show that the principle factor that
determines  the  behavior  is  the  magnitude  of  the  thermal  inter-
action  between  the  porous  solid  and  the  gases  [75] .  The  high-
velocity, sound velocity and detonation regimes will occur when
the porous medium has relatively large pores (pores with scales
greater than the flame thickness); the flame propagates with lim-
ited interaction with the solid. Alternatively, a reactor with pores
of  the  scale  of  the  reaction  zone  or  smaller  will  support  low-
velocity reaction zone propagation where the thermal interaction
between the solid and the gas is large, and this review focuses on
low-velocity regime filtration combustion.

action  zone  will  propagate  downstream,  and  if  the  flame  speed
increases,  the  reaction  zone  will  propagate  upstream.  Almost  all
modeling and experiments have indicated that the reaction zone
is stationary for a unique velocity at each equivalence ratio, how-
ever some papers have reported the observation [77] and predic-
tion [78,79] of “anchoring regimes” where the reaction zone is sta-
tionary over a range of velocities in micro-fibrous porous media
with ceramic fibers 4 μm in diameter. Hydrodynamic changes to
the shape and therefore area of the reaction zone are proposed as
the reason for anchoring, though further investigation is warranted
(see discussion on modeling below). In addition, some observations
of oscillating reaction zones have been reported [44,68] . Advanced
two-dimensional and potentially three-dimensional modeling is re-
quired to understand the full range of the transient behavior of fil-
tration combustion.

The propagation of the reaction zone can be observed exper-
imentally  by  temperature  measurement  ( Fig.  17 )  and  by  photo-
graph  ( Fig.  18 ).  Downstream  and  upstream  propagation  rates  in
low-velocity-regime  filtration  combustion  have  been  observed  to
reach  ∼1 cm/s,  and  stable  combustion  can  be  achieved  with  gas
flow velocities on the order of 10–100 cm/s. According to theory
[74] , the direction and magnitude of the propagation velocity de-
pends  on  many  parameters  including  porous  medium  character-
istics, reactant composition (including diluents), equivalence ratio
and inlet velocity, and multiple researchers have described experi-
mental observations of these complex relationships [16,17,80,81] .

In many experiments with filtration reactors, instability of the
propagating reaction zone has been observed; the shape of the re-
action  zone  changes  or  the  reaction  zone  breaks  into  fragments
as  shown  in  Figs.  19  and  20 ,  respectively.  As  noted  by  Minaev
et al. [82] , the operation of a practical reactor would be difficult
or impossible with an unstable reaction zone. Vainshtein first at-
tempted to explain this instability by creating a theoretical model
that included both hydrodynamic and thermal instability sources
[83] . Vainshtein showed that propagating reaction zones are more
stable when the reaction front propagates upstream relative to the
solid porous media rather than downstream as has been observed
in many experiments. Later, Minaev reported on experiments and
modeling undertaken to further understand observations of stable
upstream-propagating  reaction  zones  and  unstable  downstream-
propagating reaction zones [82] . In addition to confirming the sta-
bility of upstream propagating fronts relative to downstream prop-
agating  fronts  using  a  hydrodynamic  model,  Minaev  found  criti-
cal reactor diameters (for cylindrical reactors) under which insta-
bility would not be observed. Dobrego et al. [84] performed ex-
periments and created a two-dimensional numerical simulation to
provide simple expressions for the size of the reaction zone incli-
nation, a measure of reaction zone instability. The inclination size
and  growth  rate  were  found  to  increase  with  the  reactor  diam-
eter and reaction front velocity. Kakutkina [85] found criteria for
the production of fragmented reaction zones, and recent work has
shown that even small inhomogeneity in initial preheating of the
solid will produce flame instability [86] .

Filtration  combustion  has  been  demonstrated  for  both  liquid
and gaseous fuels, and a typical experimental reactor is an insu-
lated cylindrical tube filled with a porous medium. Porous mate-
rials include aluminum oxide spheres [89] , silicon carbide grains
[90] ,  metal  balls  [19] ,  ceramic  foams  [91]  or  sand,  as  was  de-
scribed in one of the earliest works published in English literature
on gaseous filtration combustion [68] . The effects of porous media
material and pore size on low-velocity filtration combustion has
been studied by multiple researchers [6 8,92,93] . De Soete [6 8] ex-
perimented with a reaction front submerged in sand grains with
varying  diameters.  Minimum  grain  sizes  for  supporting  a  stable
combustion  zone  were  found  by  comparing  the  chain  branching
probability  with  the  chain  breaking  probability,  which  increases

Fig. 16.  Nonreacting and reacting fronts in porous media (a) thermal front in inert
gas propagating at velocity u t (b) combustion front of reacting mixture propagating

A critical relationship between propagation velocity and ther-
mal  energy  in  filtration  combustion  in  the  low-velocity  regime
can be understood by comparing a thermal front and a combus-
tion  front  propagating  in  a  porous  medium  ( Fig.  16 ).  If  an  inert
gas  is  introduced  into  a  porous  medium  and  flows  from  left  to
right with an initial single impulse of thermal energy, the gas and
solid temperature will change as a function of time as shown in
Fig. 16 (a); the maximum temperature decreases as the front prop-
agates  downstream,  but  the  total  energy  remains  constant  until
energy begins to exit the system at Time = 3. The rate of propa-
gation and the shape of the temperature profile depends on the
gas  and  solid  properties  and  the  inlet  velocity  of  the  incoming
gas. Fig. 16 (b) shows the gas temperature for an exothermic react-
ing gas flowing through a porous medium; in this case the max-
imum temperature does not decrease as it propagates, and ther-
mal energy increases over time [76] as described by Zhdanok and
Kennedy [16] .

The direction of propagation is inherently linked to other char-
acteristics of the combustion front such as maximum temperature.
The theoretical analysis by Zhdanok and Kennedy [16] showed that
the maximum gas temperature increase (cid:5)T is described by

(cid:5)T =

(cid:2)

(cid:5)T
ad
(cid:3)
1 − u w
u t

where (cid:5)T
ad is the temperature increase across an adiabatic com-
bustion  front,  and  u w  and  u t  are  the  velocities  of  the  combus-
tion front and a thermal front, respectively, as shown in Fig. 16 .
The  temperature  increase  may  be  significantly  greater  than  that
due to adiabatic combustion when u w is less than u t but close in
magnitude so that the thermal and combustion fronts shown in
Fig. 16 are nearly aligned. According to Zhdanok’s theory, superadi-
abatic temperatures only occur when the combustion front is prop-
agating in the same direction as the flow (co-currently). The analy-
sis also indicates that if u w and u t are of opposite signs, indicating
that the combustion front and thermal front are moving away from
each other, then (cid:5)T is less than the adiabatic temperature rise;
this is called subadiabatic combustion. At the unique condition of
u w = 0 (stationary front), the temperature increase is that predicted
from an adiabatic calculation. In this case the reaction rate exactly
balances the rate of reactants flowing into the reaction zone. When
the equivalence ratio increases or decreases, the reaction rate and
flame speed of the mixture increase or decrease accordingly; if the
inlet velocity is maintained and the flame speed decreases, the re-

packed bed for fuel reforming, though reticulated ceramics have a
propensity for cracking and fast reaction zone propagation, which
are undesirable traits for practical application.

The propagating front in filtration combustion produces a prac-
tical difficulty: the reactor cannot be operated indefinitely. In order
to  move  past  this  limitation,  some  groups  have  developed  reac-
tors in which the direction of propagation is reversed periodically.
These reactors have been termed reciprocal flow reactors [94] or
reactors  with  reciprocating  superadiabatic  combustion  in  porous
media  [95] .  In  a  superadiabatic  reciprocal  flow  reactor,  combus-
tion is initiated, and operating conditions are selected that produce
a downstream-propagating reaction zone. When the reaction zone
nears one end of the porous medium, the  flow is reversed, and
the  reaction  zone  propagates  in  the  reverse  direction.  Repeating
this procedure results in pseudo-steady operation. The basic design
and description of the physical parameters are shown in Fig. 21 for
a reactor used to generate electricity when coupled with a ther-
moelectric device. The concept was introduced in the literature by
Hanamura et al. [95] with the objective of developing a practical
device for the destruction of paint vapors. This original numerical
study was followed by experiments with the intended applications
of radiative heating or generating electrical power by coupling a
reciprocal flow reactor with a thermoelectric device [96] , experi-
ments and modeling on the conversion of ultra-rich mixtures of
methane/air to syngas [97] , and a numerical study of integrating
the reciprocal flow reactor with a heat exchanger for process heat-
ing [98] . Other methods of reaction zone stabilization are possible,
such as variation of the flow area in the flow direction [68,99] , but
if the reaction zone is stationary relative to the solid, then the key
heat transfer mechanism of filtration combustion, relative motion
of the hot solid, is lost, and the reactor operates as a unidirectional
flow reactor with a consequent reduction in operating range.

These results, along with the lower pressure drop across a more
porous solid, indicate that reticulated ceramics are preferable to a

One  of  the  more  significant  experimental  advances  that  has
been made in recent history is experimentation with a wider vari-
ety of fuels, particularly for the purpose of producing syngas [22] .
Many early studies focused on gaseous fuels such as hydrogen and
methane [62,68,74,97,100] while liquid fuels have been tested in
more recent work [27] . Smith et al. demonstrated the conversion
of  wet  and  dry  ethanol  and  jet  fuel  and  butanol  [101]  to  syn-
gas using a filtration reactor of alumina spheres. Recently liquified
petroleum gas, diesel fuel, and heavy fuel oil were converted to
syngas in a filtration reactor [102] . Vaporization, mixing and de-
livery  of  the  reactants  to  the  porous  medium  are  the  principle
difficulties in working with liquid fuels, and these issues are dis-
cussed in depth by Mujeebu [27] . Filtration combustion was first
described as a reaction zone propagating through a porous solid
fuel [103,104] , and some workers have used solid fuels in conjunc-
tion with gaseous fuels in a hybrid filtration reactor. In this type of
reactor a porous bed is formed by mixing inert material with solid
fuel such as wood pellets [105] or coal [106] . A mixture of fuel
and  oxidizer  flows  through  the  bed,  and  the  oxidizer  consumes
both the gaseous and solid fuels. Further investigation on burning
solid fuels included the gasification of coal dust with water addi-
tion [107] .

Since the beginning of research in this field, numerical and an-
alytical studies have provided insights into the theory and opera-
tion of filtration combustion. Babkin et al. [74] reported an analyt-
ical model that included finite-rate heat transfer between the gas
and the solid (a two-temperature model), and showed predictions
of superadiabatic and subadiabatic temperatures that agreed well
with their experimental data. In further modeling work, the effect
of heat loss was included, and the predictions of this model were
compared with experimental data where the heat loss was varied
by using reactors of varying tube diameters and thicknesses [108] .
These analytical models as well as early finite-difference numeri-
cal models [95,100] generally employed one-step global reactions
instead of full chemical kinetic models, which were first included
in filtration combustion models by Henneke and Ellzey [17] and
Kennedy et al. [109] . Many modeling studies since then have em-
ployed full chemical kinetic models [110] , which enable investiga-
tion of the chemical structure of the reaction zone and the predic-
tion of product species. Since filtration reactors enable the burn-
ing of mixtures far outside the conventional flammability limits,
chemical  kinetics  models  are  sometimes  used  beyond  the  range
of equivalence ratios for which they have been validated. GRI 1.2
produced accurate predictions of hydrogen and carbon monoxide
for rich methane combustion [109] , but numerical predictions for
more complex fuels like heptane and ethanol [110] have not shown
adequate agreement with experiments at very high equivalence ra-
tios as can be seen in Fig. 22 .

Most  modeling  of  filtration  combustion  has  treated  the  solid
heuristically  [17]  or  as  a  continuum  with  effective  properties
derived  from  volume-averaging  [87,111]  with  some  exceptions
[12,79,112–114] . Recently, Sirotkin et al. [78] developed a model of
filtration combustion in which the porous media was modeled in
two dimensions with discrete pores ( Fig. 23 ). The conditions for
which  the  front  was  not  propagating,  which  they  referred  to  as
the flame anchoring regime, were studied specifically. Their main
finding was that they observed and predicted reaction zone prop-
agation velocities of zero over a range of inlet velocities at a given
equivalence ratio (for equivalence ratios greater than ∼0.6), though
no  mechanistic  reason  was  given  for  the  observation.  The  pre-
diction  of  a  range  of  flame-anchored  states  was  consistent  with
their  own  experimental  observations  [115] ,  but  this  result  is  in
contrast  to  results  from  similar  experiments,  in  which  standing
waves were observed for unique equivalence ratios at a given inlet
velocity [109] and models with continuous porous media, which
showed  a  unique  inlet  velocity  for  a  zero-velocity  reaction  zone

beads. Open markers are computational results, closed markers are experimental
results and lines are equilibrium calculations (Reprinted from Smith et al. with per-
mission of Elsevier).

at  a  given  equivalence  ratio  [74] .  A  two-dimensional  model  by
Fursenko [79] also predicted flame anchoring, which was observed
in experiments on filtration combustion in micro-fibrous media, i.e.
media  with  ceramic  fibers  4  μm  in  diameter  [77] .  Fursenko  ex-
plained the flame anchoring as a consequence of hydrodynamic in-
stability, which distorts the flame front and thus the burning area.
The change in flame front shape and area allows for an anchored
flame over a range of flow rates since a flame will anchor when-
ever the flow velocity matches the burning velocity. It is reason-
able to find a range of flame-anchored inlet velocities in a two-
dimensional non-uniform model like Sirotkin’s because the flame
shape and area varies in the flow direction, and the condition of
matching flow velocity to flame speed can be met when flames
stabilize in different locations. It is also important to consider that
the  model  included  many  simplifications,  such  as  a  single  step
reaction, adiabatic boundaries and the calculation of the velocity
field independent of the solution of the energy equation, each of
which could have effects on stability [12,41] . Further refinement
of multidimensional and discrete models will enhance the under-
standing of the complex and unique phenomenon of propagating
reaction zones in filtration combustion.

3. Steady state counter-flow reactors

In  early  work  on  a  unidirectional  reactor,  Kotani  and  Takeno
[48] observed that performance was improved when the exhaust
flow was directed around the external walls of the reactor, thus
providing  an  additional  means  of  heat  transfer.  They  referred  to
this as external heat transfer, as compared to internal heat transfer
associated with the embedded solid matrix. This formed the basic
idea of another type of reactor, referred to here generally as the
counter-flow reactor, in which internal heat transfer is enhanced
as compared to an axial flow reactor via transverse heat transfer
from combustion products across channel walls.

3.1. Operating principle of counter-flow reactors

The  fundamental  processes  of  a  counter-flow  reactor  are  il-
lustrated for two channels with counter-flowing fluids in Fig. 24 .
Cold reactants enter the channel and heat is transferred through
the wall separating the two channels. In addition, heat is trans-
ferred internally through wall conduction and radiation from the

hot zone surrounding the flame upstream to colder walls which
then transfer energy to the cold reactants. Several studies have de-
veloped the theoretical basis for counter-flow heat recirculating re-
actors, including the importance of conductive and internal con-
vective heat transfer on heat recirculation and the impact of exter-
nal convective heat losses on flame stability and operating range
[15] .  The  ability  of  flames  to  self-regulate  their  positions  in  ad-
jacent channels in response to operating conditions is a key fea-
ture  of  counter-flow  reactors;  this,  and  the  criterion  of  relative
flame position for stability, have been demonstrated through theo-
retical analyses [115,116] . Later, the theoretical analysis of Kurdyu-
mov and Matalon [117] demonstrated the importance of transverse

heat  transfer;  namely  that  an  increase  in  the  surface  area  of  a
separating wall between cold reactants and hot products increases
heat exchange, thereby enhancing the burning speed and sustain-
ing combustion at higher reactant flow rates as compared to adi-
abatic conditions (increased   ̃ U ). This increased area for transverse
heat exchange, along with the insulating effect of adjacent chan-
nels against external heat loss [12] , are significant distinctions be-
tween counter-flow and unidirectional reactors, which rely solely
on axial heat transfer, and single channel reactors, which consist
solely of outside walls which are prone to heat loss. These differ-
ences translate to a much broader range of flame stabilization in
terms of equivalence ratio and burning rates [15] .

3.2. Counter-flow reactor designs

Counter-flow reactors offer a number of advantages over unidi-
rectional flow reactors; for example, counter-flow reactors can be
designed to be compact for portable applications. Large external
surface area-to-volume ratios at small scales can lead to significant
external heat loss, however, which can cause instability in micro-
scale combustors [116] . Thus, counter-flow reactor designs seek to
incorporate large internal surface areas for heat recirculation while
minimizing  external  surface  area  for  heat  loss  (i.e.  small   ̃ H  de-
signs). A number of counter-flow reactors have been devised which
harness  the  improved  heat  transfer  characteristics  of  small-scale
channels to effectively recirculate heat while also reducing exter-
nal wall area where heat loss occurs. Examples of these geome-
tries are illustrated in Fig. 25 . The folded and dual folded channel
reactors are continuous channels formed in a U-shape ( Fig. 25 (a)
and  (b),  respectively).  The  spiral  reactor  is  similar  in  concept  to
the folded channel, except that the counter-flowing channels are
rolled together with reactants flowing in the outside channel and
products  produced  at  the  center  flowing  out  of  the  neighboring
channel ( Fig. 25 (c)). The counter-flow channel reactor consists of
straight channels with counter-flowing fluid in neighboring chan-
nels ( Fig. 25 (d)).

3.2.1. Folded channel reactor

Perhaps the simplest counter-flow geometry is a folded channel,
sometimes referred to as a U-shaped or bent channel ( Fig. 25 (a))
in  which  reactants  enter  one  channel  and  flow  around  a  bend
where combustion occurs. Combustion products then flow into the
adjacent  channel  and  exit  the  other  side  of  the  reactor.  Varia-
tions on the simple folded reactor have included dual folded chan-
nels on both sides of the inlet tube in a planar configuration or
utilized  a  cylindrical  design  to  surround  the  inlet  tube  with  an
annular  tube  ( Fig.  25 (b)).  The  objective  of  these  variants  on  the
folded channel is to increase heat recirculation from product gases
to  reactant  gases  while  shielding  the  preheated  reactants  from
heat loss to the surroundings. Heat is transferred from hot com-
bustion  products  through  the  inner  wall  of  the  bent  channel  to
preheat the incoming reactants, and the other walls are exterior
walls through which heat loss or external heating can occur. An
early model was developed of such counter-flow heat recirculat-

ing combustors that included transverse heat transfer from prod-
uct  to  reactant  gases  through  a  thermally  thin  wall  via  convec-
tion on both sides of the wall, combustion in a well-stirred reactor
at the end of the reactor, ambient losses and axial heat conduc-
tion through the wall in the streamwise direction [15] . The critical
role of heat loss in reactor stability was highlighted by the rela-
tively modest dimensionless heat loss ratio (  ̃ H ) of 0.05 which re-
sulted in significant decrease in reactor temperature. This model
of a folded reactor was compared to that of a single tube with a
flame stabilized at the exit of the tube with heat recirculation oc-
curring via conduction along the axial direction of the tube. The
flame  at  the  exit  of  the  tube  required  a  higher  minimum  fuel
concentration  for  stable  operation  as  compared  to  the  counter-
current configuration for a range of Biot number ( B ), ( Fig. 26 ). Re-
sults also showed that axial conduction has a significant impact
on the operating limits of counter-flow combustors by providing
an  avenue  for  heat  redistribution  from  the  combustion  zone  ar-
eas of the reactor where losses to ambient occur. As B decreases,
the  relative  importance  of  solid  conduction  increases  and  heat
is less effectively recirculated into the mixture, preventing stable
combustion.

Another mathematical model examined a U-shaped combustor
with insulated outer walls and showed that the dividing wall be-
tween  the  two  sides  of  the  channel  effectively  acted  as  a  heat
sink, removing heat from combustion products, and a heat source,
heating the incoming gas, thereby permitting the stabilization of
methane/air  flames  below  the  standard  condition  lean  flamma-
bility  limit  [118] .  Experimental  studies  have  compared  the  per-
formance  of  straight  and  folded  channels  and  demonstrated  im-
proved  performance,  in  terms  of  extended  stable  reactant  flow
rates and equivalence ratios, when counter-current heat recircula-
tion was implemented [119,120] . An experimental investigation of
methane/air by Maruta et al. [38] used external heating of a folded
reactor, which allowed for heat recirculation independent of heat
release by combustion, to substantially broaden flammability limits
and stable inlet velocity operating range as compared to a straight
channel. Consistent with work on other reactors, the authors con-
cluded that heat recirculation enables stable combustion beyond
standard condition flammability limits and at reactant flow rates
above the adiabatic flame speed, and that the folded geometry en-
hances these effects.

methane/air flame stability, as indicated by the critical heat loss coefficient above
which combustion cannot be sustained. Results are shown for a single channel re-
actor and a dual-folded channel (“Heat recirculating”) reactor in which the center
channel is encased by two exhaust channels (Reprinted from Chen et al. [121] with
permission of Elsevier).

The impact of materials on stability of combustion in a folded
channel  reactor  has  been  studied  for  various  designs,  and  these
studies have shown that wall thermal conductivity plays a key role
in flame stability. Fig. 27 shows the critical external heat loss co-
efficient, above which combustion cannot be sustained due to ex-
cessive convective and radiative heat losses, evaluated in numeri-
cal simulations for a single channel combustor and a dual-folded
channel combustor, in which the center channel is encased in two
exhaust channels, for a range of wall thermal conductivities [121] .
The folded combustor sustains combustion at higher critical heat
loss coefficients than the single channel, except at high wall ther-
mal conductivities where no additional significant advantage over
axial wall conduction was offered by the additional transverse heat
recirculation in the folded reactor. At low wall thermal conductivi-
ties, the single channel did not achieve sufficient heat recirculation
via axial conduction alone to sustain combustion against significant
heat losses. An experimental study of folded channel reactors by
Lee et al. [122] supports these findings, as lower thermal conduc-
tivity quartz combustors supported wider flammability limits than
stainless steel combustors, which was attributed to the ability to
achieve higher local temperatures for effective heat recirculation.

3.2.2. Swiss roll combustors

A variation on the folded channel is the spiral channel or Swiss
roll combustor ( Fig. 25 (c)) [8] . As a result of the spiral geometry,

stable combustion of propane in Swiss roll combustors with a range of geome-
tries (W – wide combustion chamber and shallow channels, S – narrow combustion
chamber and shallow channels, D – narrow combustion chamber and deep chan-
nels) and construction materials (all reactors constructed of stainless steel except
two S-type reactors have quartz caps with and without insulation – Sq and Si, re-
spectively) (Reprinted from Kim et al. [125] with permission of Elsevier).

there  is  a  significantly  larger  ratio  of  internal  heat  transfer  area
to external heat loss area (smaller   ̃ H ) as compared to folded re-
actors [123] . A number of experimental and modeling studies have
been undertaken to understand the performance of Swiss roll com-
bustors. Results have shown two extinction regimes: one at high
flow rates and Re where insufficient residence time for combustion
leads to blow-off of the flame, and another at low flow rates and
Re where external heat losses exceed the heat release rate; in fact,
these two modes of extinction are critical for all small-scale reac-
tors and are observed in many heat recirculating reactor studies
[124] . An experimental study by Kim et al. [125] of multiple Swiss
roll combustors with varying channel and combustion chamber ge-
ometries and constructed of multiple materials examined the min-
imum inlet velocities at which each combustor supported stable
combustion over a wide range of propane equivalence ratios. The
results of that study, summarized in Fig. 28 , show that minimum
velocities ranged from near to well above the maximum laminar
burning  velocities  of  propane,  which  is  approximately  0.44 m/s.
Blow-off was not observed over the range of inlet velocities tested
in this study.

Experimental testing and three-dimensional modeling of Swiss
roll  combustors  have  been  conducted  to  guide  combustor  de-
sign  and  operating  conditions  [123,126] .  Comparison  of  a  three-

serted in the combustion chamber showed higher reactant velocity
blow-off limits and lower heat loss as compared to quartz and SiC
reactors (high ε). This increased stability was attributed to lower
external radiative losses induced by stainless steel as compared to
other materials. These findings are consistent with the modeling
work of Hackert et al. [12] who showed that increased emissiv-
ity  led  not  only  to  increased  burning  rate  via  heat  recirculation
but also increased radiant fraction (i.e. heat loss) in a honeycomb-
type reactor structure; notably, the model of Hackert et al. did not
account for radial losses from the reactor which could affect the
impact of radiative heat transfer on burning rate if increased heat
losses were incurred along the length of the reactor. In summary,
the effect of radiative heat transfer is not only additional heat re-
circulation but also the redistribution of heat, similar to the effect
of axial conduction along reactor walls, which can increase exter-
nal losses and reduce reactor stability.

3.2.3. Counter-flow channels

A variation on the folded geometry is the counter-flow chan-
nel reactor in which isolated streams flow in opposing directions
in neighboring channels ( Fig. 25 (d)). Heat is transferred between
these channels in a similar way to the folded reactor except each
channel  contains  reactants,  a  combustion  zone  and  combustion
products. The combustion products in each channel heat reactants
in one adjacent channel or multiple adjacent channels depending
on the geometry of the reactor. Heat transfer is dominated by con-
vective heat transfer between the solid walls and the gases in such
reactors due to the use of thin and highly conductive separating
walls between the channels. One-dimensional models have been
developed which capture this transverse heat transfer to study the
dynamics of the flames in a two-channel counter-flow geometry
[115,116,130] . Fursenko et al. [130] used a one-dimensional model
to study the stabilization location of flames in a counter-flow re-
actor  in  response  to  changes  in  reactant  velocity  and  heat  loss.
Results showed that the separation distance between flames de-
creased with increase in gas velocity and increase in heat loss. Ju
and Choi also conducted one-dimensional modeling to study the
stabilization of methane flames below their flammability limit in a
two-channel reactor Ju and Choi [116] . External heat losses were
shown  to  be  influential  in  flame  stability  and  could  lead  to  ex-
tinction,  in  contrast  to  the  model  results  of  Ronney  [15]  which
revealed  no  extinction  limit  at  low  mass  fluxes  in  the  absence
of streamwise conduction in the separating wall. While Ronney’s
model demonstrated the potentially significant impact of axial con-
duction along a separating wall on extinction in a parallel chan-
nel reactor via heat redistribution and subsequent loss, the use of
a well-stirred reactor (WSR) did not capture the effects of flame
thickness and thermal diffusion on external heat loss. Ju and Choi
did include these effects and demonstrated that external heat loss
is sufficient to quench flames, even without heat conduction along
the inner wall. Thus, between these two modeling studies, the crit-
ical importance of heat loss, whether directly via external losses or
indirectly via heat distribution within the channel and subsequent
external losses, has been demonstrated. Fig. 29 shows the temper-
ature distributions of flames in two adjacent channels for different
levels of heat transfer intensity between channels, or heat recir-
culation; a scale factor ( χ ) was used to artificially vary the rate
of convective heat transfer to the walls, calculated using Newton’s
Law of Cooling, for which larger values of χ indicate higher rates
of heat transfer and recirculation [116] . The presence of heat re-
circulation ( χ = 0.002) created a significant convective preheating
zone ahead of the convective-diffusive zone of the flame observed
with and without heat recirculation ( χ = 0.0). Additionally, the im-
pact of heat recirculation on peak temperature can be observed in
the results, with subadiabatic peak flame temperatures (  ̃ T , denoted
by T in Fig. 30 , less than unity) produced without heat recirculation

Fig. 29.  Numerical temperature profiles, non-dimensionalized by adiabatic flame
temperature, are shown for flames in adjacent (upper and lower) channels of a
counter-flow channel reactor with and without heat recirculation ( χ = 0.002 and
χ = 0.0, respectively) at a flame separation distance (L) of zero and a given normal-
ized flame concentration (Y F ) and external heat loss scale ( κ) (Reprinted from Ju
et al. [116] with permission of Elsevier).

dimensional  model  and  experimental  results  showed  excellent
agreement with a two-dimensional model that incorporated a vol-
umetric  sink  term  into  the  energy  equation  for  external  losses;
this similarity was attributed to a minimal temperature gradient
along the height of each channel within the combustor. The three-
dimensional results also showed the importance of turbulence in
damping  out  Dean  vortices  that  form  when  a  turbulence  model
is included [126] . A two-dimensional representation of an element
of the Swiss roll combustor near the center section was achieved
by modeling a folded channel that had adiabatic walls except near
the turn in the channel where heat exchange was permitted, and
showed that the flame stabilized in or near the turn in the chan-
nel, analogous to the center section of the Swiss roll combustor
[117] .

The effects of materials on flame stability in a Swiss roll reac-
tor are similar to those observed in folded channel studies: high
thermal conductivity walls are detrimental to flame stability be-
cause of the increased heat loss incurred by the reactor. An ex-
perimental study by Vijayan and Gupta [127] examined the con-
struction of Swiss roll combustors from steel, aluminum and ce-
ramics and found that the metal combustors were not able to sus-
tain  propane/air  flames  without  external  heating  because  of  the
high thermal conductivity of the material, which produced a low B
for the reactor. The extinction induced by high thermal conductiv-
ity materials was also observed when a high thermal conductivity
viewing window was installed on the reactor in place of quartz.
A two-dimensional numerical model has shown similar results in
which the fuel mole fraction of lean propane/air mixtures at ex-
tinction decreased significantly with decrease in thermal conduc-
tivity [11] . The benefits observed from decreasing thermal conduc-
tivity do not extend to the limit at zero conductivity, however, be-
cause wall conduction is required for heat recirculation; therefore,
optimum  reactor  material  properties  which  produce  the  widest
possible operating range can be found for a given reactor geome-
try [10] . Additionally, low emissivity materials have been shown to
be required for ultra-lean combustion in the Swiss roll combustor
[128] . A numerical study by Fan et al. [129] highlighted the impor-
tance of material emissivity in addition to thermal conductivity, as
a stainless steel Swiss roll combustor (low ε) with a bluff body in-

due  to  external  heat  losses,  and  superadiabatic  temperatures
(  ̃ T  > 1) produced with heat recirculation.

The  impact  of  heat  recirculation  intensity  on  extinction  limit
flame speed and temperature, as well as critical heat loss level at
extinction,  were  quantified  and  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  30 .  As
heat transfer intensity was increased from χ = 0.0 (no convective
heat transfer) to χ = 1.0 (convective heat transfer equal to that cal-
culated for fully developed internal flow), the flame temperature
increased by approximately 75% of its adiabatic value while flame
speed increased dramatically to greater than 6 times its adiabatic
value (  ̃ U = 6 ) and the heat loss at the extinction limit ( κ) increased
to 38 times the natural convection heat loss. Thus, the ability of
heat recirculation to extend combustion stability by counteracting
external  loss-induced  extinction  was  demonstrated.  Furthermore,
an increase in throughput was achieved relative to a reactor with-
out heat recirculation.

The  results  of  Ju  and  Choi  [116]  also  demonstrated  that  the
flame separation distances change in response to changes in heat
loss and recirculation. A one-dimensional model was constructed

which approximated a two-channel geometry, neglecting the ther-
mal conductivity along the channel walls. This model was used to
evaluate the range of heat loss, mixture composition and reactant
velocity over which flame stabilization could be achieved. Analyti-
cal and experimental results showed that reaction zones were sta-
tionary only if the flame fronts are positioned at positive separa-
tion distances, upstream of the location of the flame fronts in the
adjacent channels; once the flame fronts pass each other, the con-
figuration is no longer stable [116] . Similar results were presented
in other studies of folded channels, for which a flame position be-
fore the bend in the channel constitutes a stable flame [115,122] as
illustrated in Fig. 31 .

Fig. 32 shows the maximum flame separation distance for dif-
ferent values of heat transfer intensities over a range of lean equiv-
alence ratios at and below the lean flammability limit of methane
in a counter-flow channel reactor. The flames can freely propagate
in the channel at and above the lean flammability limit as they do
not require heat recirculation to stabilize, making control of flame
position within the channel difficult. Below the flammability limit,

two flame separation distances are shown: one positive and one
negative. The positive, stable separation distances were found to
decrease as the reactant mixture became leaner, as an increase in
heat recirculation is needed to increase the flame speed of leaner
mixtures and permit stabilization. Conversely, less heat recircula-
tion and increase in flame speed were needed for higher equiva-
lence ratios to stabilize at a given reactant flow rate, leading to an
increase in flame separation distance.

The  importance  of  transverse  interfacial  heat  transfer  as  the
dominant  heat  transfer  mode  in  counter-flow  reactors  has  been
elucidated  in  one-  and  two-dimensional  models  of  counter-flow
reactors of finite lengths [45,131,132] . A one-dimensional analyti-
cal model was developed by Schoegl and Ellzey [45] to study and
compare co-flow and counter-flow configurations in finite length
channels; finite length channels allowed for more substantial loss
of enthalpy via hot products exiting the reactor as compared to in-
finite length channels, which allow sufficient time for equilibration
of  temperature  between  exiting  products  and  entering  reactants
in adjacent channels. The impacts of equivalence ratio, reactor ge-
ometry and heat transfer parameters on axial flame position over
a range of flow rates were examined, some results of which are
shown in Fig. 33 for variations in equivalence ratio ( φ), inlet tem-
perature ( T
0 ), axial conduction and gas/wall heat transfer. Notably,
a wide range of equivalence ratios beyond the upper flammability
limit of methane could be stabilized, although the stable position
and flow rate ranges narrowed as equivalence ratio increased due
to the need for increased heat recirculation for a stabilized flame
to be achieved. Also noteworthy, stability was shown to be more
sensitive to increases in gas/wall heat transfer as compared to axial

conduction, indicating that transverse heat transfer between gases
and dividing walls is the dominant heat transfer mechanism in the
counter-flow reactor. For comparison, the same model was adapted
to a co-flow or unidirectional configuration, which was found to
be dominated by axial conduction and interfacial heat transfer and
had a far more limited stable operating range. A two-dimensional
model  of  a  finite  length  counter-flow  reactor  was  developed  by
Belmont et al. [131] to study the impact of variation in height and
length of reactor channels. Results showed that heat recirculation
was more effective at smaller channel heights, supporting the de-
duction of a significant impact of transverse interfacial heat trans-
fer in other studies.

The  concepts  developed  in  the  models  for  combustion  in
counter-flow combustors have been implemented in experimental
studies of ultra-rich [133–135] and ultra-lean [136,137] methane,
propane and heptane combustion using four-channel counter-flow
reactors  with  opposing  flow  in  adjacent  channels.  These  stud-
ies  confirmed  key  characteristics  of  heat  recirculating  counter-
flow  combustors  that  were  elucidated  by  modeling  studies,  in-
cluding sub-limit flame stabilization, superadiabatic temperatures,
and self-regulation of flame positions within the channels. Stable
operating  points  were  achieved  for  all  tested  fuels  beyond  their
respective  upper  and  lower  flammability  limits  and  at  tempera-
tures above their adiabatic flame temperatures, confirming that su-
peradiabatic operation was achieved by heat recirculation through
the channel walls. Models of counter-flow reactors have indicated
that, for meso-scale combustors, external heat loss remains highly
influential  on  flame  stabilization  and  peak  temperatures  despite
the insulating effects of adjacent channels. Counteracting external

heat losses are the rates of heat release and internal heat trans-
fer within the combustor channels, and the balance between these
heat transfer rates determines the level of superadiabatic opera-
tion achieved in the channels [131] . The significant impact of flow
rate on peak temperatures within the channels was observed in
experimental studies of counter-flow channel reactors. Peak chan-
nel wall temperatures and unburned hydrocarbons measured for
ultra-lean combustion are shown in Fig. 34 for three different fu-
els. Peak wall temperatures were observed to increase from sub-
adiabatic to superadiabatic with an increase in reactant velocity,
although  model  results  indicate  that  gas  temperatures  were  sig-
nificantly higher than wall temperatures, suggesting superadiabatic
conditions at all velocities [131,132] . Similar results were observed
in  studies  of  ultra-rich  combustion  as  well.  The  observed  trend
shows that the increased volumetric heat release associated with
increased velocity is relatively more important than external heat
loss resulting in higher reactor temperatures. Additionally, the im-
pact of these temperatures on the extent of fuel conversion was
shown  to  be  substantial,  such  as  the  observed  increase  in  un-
burned hydrocarbons at lower reactant velocities and peak tem-
peratures in studies of ultra-lean combustion [136,137] .

4. Applications of heat recirculating reactors

The ability of heat-recirculating reactors to burn mixtures out-
side the conventional flammability limits and at burning rates far
exceeding  the  adiabatic  laminar  flame  speed  at  standard  condi-
tions opens up a wide range of applications [7] . Stable combus-
tion  of  lean  and  ultra-lean  reactants  provides  a  pathway  to  in-
crease fuel efficiency and destroy low levels of contaminants. The
high radiant output of solid surfaces is useful for industrial heat-
ing applications and electricity generation through thermoelectric
and thermophotovoltaic generation. Finally, ultra-rich combustion
can produce syngas, which is useful as a fuel or chemical input
to other processes such as fuel cells. These applications depend on
the range of equivalence ratios that can be stably burned and burn-
ing velocities that can be achieved in these reactors; a selection
from the literature is shown in Table 1 .

As Table 1 indicates, stable burning at equivalence ratios that
are nearly 5 times the rich flammability limit [97] and 5% of the
lean flammability limit [96] have been achieved. For lean operation
the reciprocal flow reactor was operated at the most extreme con-

dition of an equivalence ratio of 0.026, with a filtration reactor and
the Swiss roll reactor also operating at very low equivalence ra-
tios (0.1 and 0.15, respectively). For rich conditions, the two-section
reactor and reciprocal flow reactors were operated at the highest
equivalence ratios of 9.0 and 8.0, respectively. Such comparisons
can be informative, but it is important to interpret any compar-
isons with the understanding that operating at the most extreme
equivalence ratio or burning velocity was not necessarily a study
goal  and  so  the  limits  of  stable  operation  might  not  have  been
evaluated. Laminar flame speeds for typical hydrocarbons at near-
stoichiometric conditions are ∼40 cm/s, with the flame speed de-
creasing  as  the  equivalence  ratio  deviates  significantly  from  sto-
ichiometry.  For  both  lean  and  rich  conditions,  burning  rates  far
exceeding  the  laminar  flame  speeds  were  achieved.  The  highest
burning rates were demonstrated in the Swiss roll reactor, which
achieved a burning velocity of ∼500 cm/s with lean methane/air
mixtures.

Applications of heat-recirculating reactors are considered at var-
ious scales, including micro- and meso-scales for portable applica-
tions as reviewed by Ju and Maruta [25] and larger scales for fuel
reforming [22] . In this section, a summary of recent work done in
each of the various major application categories is reviewed.

4.1. Lean combustion

One of the principle applications of heat-recirculating reactors
is to burn fuels as lean as possible. A survey of the literature shows
very lean operation with a variety of fuels and reactors [21] . The
reactors  generally  achieving  the  leanest  operating  conditions  are
spiral and filtration reactors, though the filtration reactors cannot
operate indefinitely, as discussed, unless they are designed as re-
ciprocal flow reactors.

Significant research has focused on the two-section reactor as a
low emissions combustor. Keramiotis et al. [65] conducted a study
on a two-section burner consisting of a layer of Al
3 followed by
a  3.9  ppcm  layer  of  SiSiC  foam.  As  shown  in  Fig.  35 ,  CO  emis-
sions are more sensitive to thermal load than NOx emissions are
at a fixed equivalence ratio. The results also illustrate the advan-
tage of operating at very lean conditions. The emissions of both
CO and NOx roughly double between λ of 1.4 and 1.2 (equivalence
ratios of 0.71 and 0.83). This wide variation illustrates the need to
carefully consider burner operating conditions such that emissions

are appropriate for a desired application. The fuel flexibility of this
burner is demonstrated by stable operation with two different fu-
els, methane and liquefied petroleum gas, and by the similarity of
the emissions profiles at similar conditions.

Filtration reactors have been used to burn very lean mixtures
of fuel and oxidizer, making them appropriate as thermal oxidiz-
ers. Hoffman et al. [96] successfully operated a reciprocal flow re-
actor  on  methane/air  at  an  equivalence  ratio  of  0.026.  The  sys-
tem  was  shown  to  be  effective  at  oxidizing  very  small  amounts
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and was further studied nu-
merically to find the relationships between the lowest flammabil-
ity  limit  (lean  combustion  limit)  and  reactor  parameters,  noting
that porous media particle size was the most important parameter
[140] .

A unique application of lean combustion for pollutant destruc-
tion was described by Chen and Ronney [126] . Their small Swiss
roll reactor, which burned mixtures of propane and air at equiv-
alence ratios as low as ∼0.1 [124] , was proposed for integration
with a gas mask to destroy chemical or biological agents; if nox-
ious agents could be burned sufficiently lean, the CO
2 level in the
exhaust would be breathable.

4.2. Radiant heating

motivated  studies  of  the  two-section  burner  as  a  radiant  heater
[57,62,63,141,142] . In Fig. 36 , radiant efficiency, defined as the per-
centage of the energy in the fuel emitted as radiation, is shown
for different downstream porous media, referred to as the flame
support layer. The thickness of the flame support layer does not
appear to significantly affect the radiant efficiency in contrast to
the pore density (ppc). Increasing the pore density, which results
in an increase of optical thickness, significantly decreases the radi-
ant output.

The magnitudes of heat transfer to the environment by radia-
tive and convective modes have been quantified in a study of small
scale Swiss roll combustors designed to be used as heaters [125] .
Fig. 37 (a) summarizes the experimentally measured mean combus-
tor temperature over a range of mean velocities for a variety of
combustor geometries and shows a positive dependence of tem-
perature on mean velocities or firing rate. Fig. 37 (b) compares cal-
culated natural convective and radiative heat loss over the range
of  experimentally  measured  combustor  temperatures  and  shows
that radiative heat transfer dominates for combustors constructed
of high emissivity materials. Furthermore, comparison of Fig. 37 (a)
and (b) indicates that heat transfer to surroundings is directly de-
pendent on inlet velocity.

4.3. Thermoelectric power generation

The hot porous medium is a very effective radiant emitter that
can be used to generate radiant heating from gaseous fuels such as
methane, which have low sooting tendencies and therefore would
not  otherwise  be  useful  for  radiant  heating.  This  characteristic

Heat-recirculating reactors are unique in their ability to gener-
ate and sustain high temperatures from lean reactant mixtures, as
demonstrated by their use as radiant heaters. This has led some

combustor-converter without heat recirculation [147] . The practi-
cal production of electrical power from thermoelectric devices still
faces  significant  hurdles:  the  thermoelectric  generator  efficiency
is generally low ( ∼10 − 15% ), and system level efficiency is even
lower [148,149] ; the standard material (Bi
3 ) for thermoelectric
power generation cannot operate above  ∼ 200 ◦C [150] , so the de-
velopment of materials that can operate at high temperatures is an
active research area [149–151] ; lastly, system-level design, includ-
ing the minimization of heat losses and the design and integra-
tion of hot and cold side heat exchangers, remains challenging and
costly [144,149,151] .

2 Te

An  alternative  to  coupling  of  combustors  and  thermoelectric
generators is the use of thermophotovoltaics with combustors. A
thermophotovoltaic generally consists of three components: a heat
source, an emitter and photovoltaic cells. When a combustor is in-
tegrated into a thermophotovoltaic system, the combustor wall can
serve as the emitter. Heat recirculating reactors have been shown
to be favorable for use in thermophotovoltaic systems because of
the  high  and  uniform  wall  temperatures  that  can  be  achieved.
Studies have examined single and two-section porous media and
counter-flow combustors, and found operating conditions and ge-
ometry to significantly impact system performance, largely through
combustor  wall  temperature  magnitude  and  distribution  unifor-
mity [152–154] . One numerical and experimental study of such a
system utilized a tubular combustor with and without a heat recu-
perator, where the heat recuperator was the addition of an axisym-
metric outer quartz cylinder to form a folded counter-flow tubu-
lar combustor [155] . Results of the study showed that reactor tem-
perature and electrical power generation were increased with the
counter-flow configuration as compared to the unidirectional com-
bustor.

4.4. Fuel reforming

The ability to combust rich and ultra-rich fuel mixtures in heat
recirculating reactors provides opportunities to reform gaseous and
liquid fuels into hydrogen- and carbon monoxide-rich syngas. The
production  of  syngas  is  desirable  for  a  number  of  applications,
including the subsequent combustion of the syngas as a cleaner
burning  fuel  than  the  original  hydrocarbon.  Rich  combustion  in
porous media reactors was reviewed in 2010 [99] and in 2016 [22] .
These reviews detailed studies where many heat recirculating reac-
tor types were used to convert various fuels to syngas and hydro-
gen. A selection of hydrogen and carbon monoxide production for
various reactors and fuels is shown in Table 2 .

researchers to investigate their use in generating power with ther-
moelectric devices, which operate most efficiently with large tem-
perature differences [25,96,143–145] . This potential was evaluated
by Weinberg [144] in a theoretical analysis of three different heat
exchanger/thermoelectric  converter  configurations.  He  found,  for
the most practical of the configurations, that the maximum possi-
ble system efficiency could be as high as 22.6%, which is a 58% im-
provement over a design with no heat recirculation, thus demon-
strating the potential of this approach. Thermoelectric generators
have been coupled to porous media combustors [145] and recip-
rocal flow filtration reactor [95,96] , with results generally show-
ing higher thermoelectric power output with increased combustor
temperature. Efficiencies, varying from experimental values of less
than 0.2% [23] to modeling values of > 5% [146] , were far from the
maximums predicted by Weinberg. A combined heat-recirculating
combustor  and  thermoelectric  converter  concept  using  a  folded
channel  combustor  was  shown  to  theoretically  achieve  a  nearly
60% increase in system efficiency by preheating as compared to a

2 + CO

2 O → H

Hydrogen  yields  are  near  50%,  while  CO  yields  are  generally
closer  to  75%,  and  those  yields  are  consistent  with  exhaust  gas
concentrations of ∼20% H
2 and ∼15% CO. Many authors have com-
pared  their  experimental  results  with  both  equilibrium  calcula-
tions and various reactor models. Generally, the models show ad-
equate prediction of concentrations and yields for moderately rich
equivalence ratios and do not agree as well with experiments at
higher equivalence ratios. This is also true for equilibrium calcula-
tions, which overpredict hydrogen concentrations at high equiva-
lence ratios ( Fig. 22 ), indicating that finite-rate kinetics are impor-
tant. Because of this, key parameters related to finite rate kinetics
have been studied in detail [97,156,157] . Studies on fuel reforming
kinetics  have  indicated  that  hydrogen  production  occurs  in  both
the primary reaction zone and downstream in which the relatively
slow steam-reforming reaction ( C n H m + n H 2 O → ( n + m
2 ) H 2 + nCO )
and water gas shift reaction ( CO + H
2 ) take place. Al-
Hamamre [156] showed that  above ∼1300 K, the hydrogen mole
fraction after long times ( > 10,0 0 0 s) was ∼0.25 and insensitive to
temperature, but reaching ∼0.25 required ∼10 0 0 s when the tem-
perature was 1400 K and only ∼0.1 seconds when the temperature
was 1900 K using a zero-dimensional kinetics model. These find-
ings indicate that a sufficiently large Da in the post-flame region
must be obtained for maximum production of hydrogen, so the pa-
rameters affecting Da (length, flow velocity and temperature) must
be considered in reactor design. The possibility of converting water
to hydrogen via the steam reforming and water gas shift reactions
has also led researchers to investigate the enhancement of hydro-
gen production by adding water to the reactants [99,158,159] as is
done with catalytic steam reforming [160] . Dobrego et al. numer-
ically [158] and Araya et al. experimentally [159] studied the ad-
dition of water to the reactants in noncatalytic reforming in heat
recirculating reactors, finding that water addition substantially im-
proved hydrogen yields, with Araya reporting 98% hydrogen con-
version  efficiency  for  methane  (where  the  hydrogen  in  water  is
not counted in the denominator of the conversion efficiency cal-
culation). A similar idea was tested by Smith et al. who converted
wet ethanol to syngas in a filtration reactor. Wet ethanol is ethanol
that  has  not  been  fully  dehydrated  by  energy-intensive  separa-
tion  processes,  so  a  systems-level  energy  savings  was  demon-
strated  by  converting  wet  ethanol,  rather  than  dry  ethanol,  to
hydrogen.

Besides raw production efficiency, other practical considerations
are important when comparing reactors for hydrogen production.
Filtration reactors can operate at the most extreme conditions but
require flow reversal for pseudo-steady operation. Hydrogen pro-
duction  generally  increases  with  equivalence  ratio  up  to  a  cer-
tain point, generally near the rich flammability limit, and then de-
creases  ;  therefore,  reactors  without  propagating  fronts  that  op-
erate  at  more  moderate  equivalence  ratios  can  be  used  for  fuel
reforming though potentially having suboptimal hydrogen produc-

tion. Another important consideration when reforming heavy fuels
is soot formation [60,161] and reactor clogging, which depend on
operating conditions and reactor design. Parallel channel reactors
can require periodic burning off of carbon deposits [134] , and to-
tal reactor clogging has been observed in filtration reactors [101] .
Butanol and jet fuel were converted [101] to syngas and hydrogen
in a filtration media reactor, but it was noted that soot buildup
clogged the reactor when burning jet fuel, and for this reason the
tested equivalence ratios were limited to 3.58. Experiments with
externally-preheated reactants have shown, promisingly, that the
soot point can be shifted rich with preheat [156] .

5. Conclusions and future work

Heat transfer into and out of reactants has a significant impact
on combustion phenomena due primarily to the strong tempera-
ture  dependence  of  chemical  kinetics.  Research  on  the  coupling
of heat transfer and combustion has provided great insights into
the major combustion phenomena of flame stability, flammability
limits, and burning rates. In the last few decades, significant effort
has focused on managing the heat transfer in reactors such that it
enhances all of these phenomena. The resulting heat recirculating
reactors have wider flammability limits, higher burning rates, and
greater flame stability than those of a conventional premixed lam-
inar flame. These greater operating ranges have provided opportu-
nities for novel reactors that may be thermal oxidizers to eliminate
trace VOCs, fuel reformers to convert hydrocarbons to syngas, or
lean reactors for low emission operations. Further development of
this important technology requires advancement in several areas.

The nature of heat recirculating reactors is that they are char-
acterized by small channels and/or tight bends, making fabrication
difficult. New fabrication methods, such as additive manufacturing
(AM), would create possibilities for both research and manufacture
of novel reactors. At the current time, AM has not been applied
extensively to devices which have the harsh thermal and chemical
conditions of a reactor, particularly when the flame is impinging on
the solid surface. Laser sintering, one AM technique, allows the use
of ceramics or metal infilled ceramics which would greatly expand
the temperature limits over conventional materials [162] . Though
not restricted to AM, topology optimization, which is a method for
computational optimization of geometry, has been applied to fluid
systems [163,164] . Topology optimization algorithms produce ge-
ometries that are often ill-suited for traditional manufacturing pro-
cesses, so the development of AM for high-temperature reacting
systems presents an opportunity for the design of optimal geome-
tries. In the future, these algorithms can be used to search for opti-
mal heat-recirculating reactor chamber geometry for the purposes
of expanding operating range, increasing firing rate or increasing
target species production as in the case of fuel reforming.

AM also opens up possibilities to tailor the material properties
such as conductivity to enhance or diminish heat transfer in a par-
ticular direction or to vary the conductivity in a single material as
has been achieved with gradient alloys of titanium, stainless steel,
invar and inconel [165] , which could be useful for flame stabiliza-
tion or other forms of control. This idea has been explored by Veer-
aragavan [166] who developed a two-dimensional computational
model that permitted different axial and transverse wall solid con-
ductivities. The results indicate that by controlling the conductiv-
ities, the operating range of the reactor may be tailored to differ-
ent specifications. Recently, Sobhani et al. [167] developed a one-
dimensional model of a two-section reactor with topology grada-
tion such that the interface had spatially graded properties rather
than a discontinuity. An experimental reactor consisted of sections
of stacked ceramic foams. Experimental and computational results
agreed qualitatively and showed that the reactor with the graded
interface had a larger stable operating range than the one with a
discrete interface. These results provide further evidence that AM
is a promising tool for development of novel reactors.

Since  the  heat-recirculating  reactors  described  in  this  review
require high interaction between the gas phase and solid phase,
the length scales (for example, pore diameter and channel widths)
are often small in order to accommodate high rates of heat trans-
fer, and the reaction zones are submerged within the pores, limit-
ing access for measurement [168] . This is especially true for com-
bustion in porous media; detailed understanding of the intra-pore
flame characteristics is still lacking due to the challenges of mak-
ing  measurements  in  the  combined  solid  and  gas  environments.
Knowledge  of  flame  shape  and  thickness  would  provide  impor-
tant insights into burning rate enhancement and flame stabiliza-
tion,  two  critical  characteristics  for  practical  designs.  Since  tem-
perature and temperature difference are the driving forces behind
combustion and heat transfer, greater understanding would allow
optimization of existing designs and provide guidance for new con-
cepts. Thermocouple and probe measurements are often limited by
the size and location of the measurement point; pore sizes must
be greater than thermocouple bead size, and many surfaces must
be  passed  through  if  the  location  is  not  at  the  outer  surface  of
a porous medium. Some careful attempts at measuring the differ-
ence between the gas and solid phase temperatures in pores have
been made [168,169] with useful results, but more work is needed.
Imaging techniques, such as x-ray computed tomography [170] and
LIF [171] , show promise to provide greater detail and advance our
understanding as they are applied to more types of heat recircu-
lating reactors.

Detailed  multi-dimensional  modeling  of  heat  recirculating  re-
actors has been limited by inherent characteristics of large time
scales  in  the  solid  and  short  time  scales  in  the  gas.  Differences
between one-dimensional and two-dimensional models show the
importance of accurately representing the detailed character of the
flow  within  these  reactors  [126] .  Chemical  kinetics  schemes  are
typically  not  optimized,  or  perhaps  not  validated  at  all,  at  ex-
treme equivalence ratios that are of interest to designers of ther-
mal oxidizers and fuel reformers. In particular, reduced schemes
which  make  computations  more  tractable,  are  rarely  validated
beyond  conventional  limits.  Three-dimensional  modeling  which
would reveal the spatial variations in temperature and concentra-
tions would be useful for design and optimization, but the compu-
tational requirements for these simulations are prohibitive [78] .

Heat  recirculating  reactors  are  often  envisioned  as  parts  of
larger systems. Examples include a fuel reformer coupled with a
fuel cell to produce electrical power [101] , a stable and efficient
heat source for thermoelectric [145] or thermophotovoltaic power
generation, and  a  radiant heater  for  manufacturing and  material
processing  [21] .  As  described  previously,  much  of  the  basic  the-
ory of heat recirculating reactors is understood. Models of varying

complexity that include coupled heat transfer, fluid mechanics and
chemical  kinetics  have  been  developed  and  validated,  and  many
hurdles in practical operation, such as operation with heavy liq-
uid fuels and experimentation with a wide variety of reactors and
materials, have been surmounted. Both model-based systems en-
gineering [172] and multidisciplinary design optimization [173] are
becoming common methods in the design and optimization of sys-
tems,  especially  in  aerospace.  Utilization  of  these  techniques  re-
quires fast-running phenomenological models (surrogate models),
as opposed to long-run-time computational fluid dynamic models
with finite-rate kinetics. Systems engineers, combustion engineers
and specialists from other disciplines will need to work together
to develop and integrate these models into systems-level models,
which can guide applications for the future
