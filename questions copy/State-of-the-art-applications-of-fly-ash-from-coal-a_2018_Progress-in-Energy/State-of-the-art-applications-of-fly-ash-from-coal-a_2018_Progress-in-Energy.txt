Over the years, the production of waste ash from many sources (e.g. coal, biomass, industrial, animal, and
municipal solid waste) and from conventional and renewable energy technologies has increased, generating
environmental problems due to the increasing amount of material disposed of in landfills.
Fly ash from coal and biomass represent the foremost waste products produced by fossil fuel combustion
and alternative natural energy sources, respectively. These waste materials are most widely utilized in agri-
cultural applications, soil stabilization, and the cement and concrete industries. Among the various methods
proposed for the reuse of fly ash, conversion to zeolite offers the greatest benefits; the process diverts ash
waste materials from disposal sites and transforms them into useful secondary products for applications
ranging from environmental mitigation to catalysis. The vast amount of literature on fly ash application is
the fruit of growing waste production and the consequent need to find innovative methods to reduce the
amount of waste deposited in landfills.
This article summarizes studies concerning both coal and biomass fly ash. The characterization and poten-
tial applications of these materials are analysed in detail through reference to the numerous studies pub-
lished on fly ash worldwide over the last number of decades. A considerable number of experiments have
been conducted using ash as a raw material for zeolite synthesis, and many others concern the utilization of
the newly-formed mineral. This paper discusses the key factors affecting zeolite synthesis, primarily from
coal fly ash; the drawbacks of each approach are also analysed.

1. Introduction

PAs the second largest-energy source worldwide, coal provides
almost 30% of the world's non-renewable primary energy, although
this is likely to decline to 27% by 2021 [1]. Unfortunately, coal is also
responsible for 45% of all energy-related carbon emissions and con-
tributes significantly to degraded air quality (e.g. through emission
of Mg, As, SO2, and NOx) [2(cid:1)11].

PChina, the USA, and Europe are the world's major coal producers.
In 2000, Europe and North America accounted for about half of the
coal demand worldwide, while Asia accounted for less than half. By
2015, Asia accounted for almost three-quarters of total coal demand,
while coal consumption in Europe and North America declined
sharply to less than one quarter. China's coal reserve, at 114 billion
tons, constitutes nearly 12% of the total proven reserves, and Chinese
primary coal demand is projected to grow from 1308 Mt in 2002 to
2402 Mt in 2030 at an average rate of 2.2% [1,5,12]. More than 80% of
total Chinese power generation comes from coal power plants [13].
The USA has an estimated 27% of the world's coal reserves distrib-
uted across more than 30 states. In 2012, the USA produced 915 Mt,
exported 113 Mt, and imported 8 Mt of coal. A total of 810 Mt was
domestically consumed, and 92% of this was used for electricity gen-
eration. In the United States, 42% of electricity was produced from
coal over the five-year period from 2009 to 2013 [13]. However, coal
consumption dropped by 15% in 2015 and another substantial
decline is expected in 2016 due to competition from cheaper renew-
able power sources and air pollution mitigation regulations that led
to coal plant retirement [1]. Coal is also one of the EU's most impor-
tant energy sources, meeting 17% of the EU primary energy demand
in 2014 [14]. However, while coal consumption in the EU measured
about 300 Mt in the early 1990s, it did not exceed 200 Mt after 2008.
In 2014, EU coal consumption totalled 179 Mt, constituting a
decrease of 41% (or 126 Mt) [15].

PFig. 1 displays global coal consumption for 2012 as reported by

Bukhari et al. [16].

PThe large quantities of coal consumed generate a large amount of
coal ash, which is the major solid product of coal combustion in ther-
mal power plants. About 800 Mt of this industrial by-product are
produced per annum worldwide [17(cid:1)20], of which approximately
500 Mt are generated in China, 140 Mt are produced in India, and
115 Mt are produced in the USA & EU (Fig. 1) [19]. The utilization of
coal ash has varied widely from a minimum of 3% to a maximum of
90%. Yao et al. [21] estimated fly ash utilization rates of 50% for the
US, over 90% for the EU, and 60% for India; for China, this rate has
increased annually, but has remained around 67% in recent years.
However, the world average has increased from 16% [22] to only 25%
[23,24] of the total ash produced. These data indicate that a substan-
tial amount of coal ash is disposed of in landfills and highlight the
mismanagement of ash in many parts of the world, which may con-
tribute to numerous environmental problems both past and future
[25(cid:1)28].

PSuch environmental impacts, along with the increasing attention
paid to the natural environment, have sparked worldwide interest in
renewable energy sources such as wind, sun, geothermal heat, and
biomass; among these, biomass is considered to show the most
promise [20,29(cid:1)39]. The literature reports global biomass produc-
tion of between 112 and 220 billion tonnes per year [20,40(cid:1)45]; the
2013 global production of biomass with energy application potential
was estimated at between 1.1 and 3.1 billion tonnes from agricul-
tural residue [20,43,46,47] and about 3 billion tonnes from forest
residue [20,43]. Biomass ash is produced during the combustion of
these renewable resources. Vassilev et al. [20,35,48] indicate that
approximately 48 Mt of biomass ash could be generated annually
worldwide if 7 billion tonnes of biomass were burned; they also dis-
cuss the environmental problems and possible benefits related to
the growing production of ash [49,50].

PIn addition to traditional coal combustion and more innovative
biomass combustion methods, technologies based on the co-com-
bustion of fossil fuels and renewable resources have been developed
in many countries worldwide over the past several years [51(cid:1)55].
Co-combustion processes have attracted great attention from the

Putility industry due to their potential for carbon dioxide emission
reduction and relatively low required investment [52,56(cid:1)60]. In
2005, Baxter [52] wrote that the International Energy Agency Bioen-
ergy Task 32 group was drafting a position paper indicating co-com-
bustion to be among the lowest risk, least expensive, most efficient,
and most rapidly actionable options for renewable-based electrical
power generation. However, Baxter also emphasized that most of
these positive outcomes arise only in comparison to other renewable
options; he concluded that, although there are many reasons to pur-
sue biomass and coal co-combustion, there are also a number of
issues related to the process that require careful consideration,
including fuel selection, boiler design, and boiler operation condi-
tions. Sahu et al. [55] also hoped to improve co-combustion technol-
ogy and boiler design, highlighting the numerous uncertainties
related to devolatilization and burning during the co-combustion of
biomass and coal. They conclude that the advantages of using bio-
mass outweigh the associated constraints.

PFocusing now on the final products of co-combustion, the diver-
sity of the biomass used in co-combustion leads to great variability
in the properties and composition of the ash produced, increasing
the challenges associated with potential ash utilization [61(cid:1)63].
Kalembkiewicz and Chmielarz [61] indicate that ash from co-com-
bustion is characterized by higher bulk density and lower pozzolanic
activity as compared to coal fly ash. Also, the chemical composition
features higher anhydrite and hematite contents and lower illite and
amorphous material contents. According to these authors, all of
these factors favour the use of co-combustion ash in agriculture and
limit its application in construction and cement production.

PMajor questions regarding coal, biomass, and co-combustion
remain based on the research outlined above, including issues sur-
rounding management of the growing amount of ash produced and
the maximum possible ash utilization. Therefore, this study aims to
summarize the current research characterizing ash residue materials
and the major uses thereof. The manuscript consists of two main
parts: Part I is devoted to the study of ash characterization and com-
mon uses, while Part II is focused on different zeolite synthesis pro-
cesses and major zeolite applications.

2. Part I. Waste ash: characterization and uses

2.1. Types of ash and characterization

PFly ash is the combustion product obtained from burning coal,

biomass, or a mix of both materials.

PNumerous studies have been performed worldwide on the char-
acterization and potential applications of fly ash. This paper focuses
on coal ash from bituminous coal and biomass ash from natural bio-
mass, which is comprised primarily of rice husks, wood and forest
residue, and sugar cane bagasse. For a brief but exhaustive descrip-
tion of co-combustion ash, refer to the review of Kalembkiewicz and
Chmielarz [61]; the review investigates both the physical and chem-
ical compositions of co-combustion industrial waste and focuses on
the properties that determine its numerous applications, which
include agriculture, cement production, and zeolite synthesis.

P2.1.1. Coal ash

PCoal is the most important fuel resource used worldwide. Coal is
ranked according to relative amounts of organic and inorganic mat-
ter of which it is composed into the following categories [64]:
anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite. Coal classifica-
tion depends on the coal age (or degree of maturation), amount of
carbon, and amount of heat energy that the coal can produce
[26,65]. Anthracite contains 86%(cid:1)97% carbon and generally has the
highest heating value among the various types of coal. Bituminous
coal contains 45%(cid:1)86% carbon and is most widely used for generat-
ing electricity, while subbituminous coal has a lower heating value

Pand carbon content (35%(cid:1)45%). Finally, lignite contains 25%(cid:1)35%
carbon and has the lowest energy content among the various types
of coal [66].

PThe mineralogical composition of coal is characterized by the
presence of silicates, oxides and hydroxides, sulphates, and carbo-
nates [67]. Silicate phases are the most characteristic minerals of
bituminous and sub bituminous coal, while sulphates are limited in
comparison with lignite [68,69]. Some lignite deposits are enriched
in gypsum and calcite [68]. Chemically speaking, coal is typically
composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, oxygen, silicon, alumin-
ium, and iron in large amounts and other elements,
including
sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, titanium, and
chlorine, in lower amounts. Other elements are usually in trace con-
centrations in coal and can be enriched or depleted according to the
plant constituents and regional, depositional, and paleoenvironmen-
tal conditions involved in coal formation [70].

PAs mentioned in the previous paragraph, the coal combustion
process produces a large amount of solid residue, which is com-
monly called coal ash. The mineralogical and chemical compositions
of coal ash are strongly influenced by the type of coal burned and
the combustion processes used, as well as the post-combustion cool-
ing method [12,67,71(cid:1)77]. Therefore, the chemical composition of
coal ash can also be used to fingerprint the composition and geologi-
cal setting of deposits [78(cid:1)80]. Bituminous coal ash contains the
highest amounts of SiO2 and Al2O3 (at 43.4% and 24%, respectively)
and lowest CaO content (6%) and is rich in Fe2O3 in comparison with
biomass ash [79].

PCoal ash is commonly divided into two categories: bottom ash
and fly ash. Bottom ash is composed of the residual coal ash that set-
tles on the bottom of the boiler after the combustion process, while
fly ash is the finer coal ash that floats into the exhaust stacks and is
collect by electrostatic precipitators during the coal burning process.
Fly ash is typically composed of 90%(cid:1)99% inorganic material, 1%(cid:1)9%
organic material, and <0.5% fluid components [81]. The inorganic
material is composed of 34%(cid:1)80% amorphous materials and crystal-
line phases (e.g. quartz, mullite, hematite, goethite, and calcite),
which contribute between 17% and 63% [81]. The fly ash organic
component is characterised by unburned carbon. Fig. 2 displays typi-
cal scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of coal fly ash, which
show a composition characterized by cenospheres and plenospheres
of sizes varying from tens of nanometres to approximately one hun-
dred micrometres (Fig. 2a-d). The spherical particles generally
exhibit bumpy surfaces; highly vesiculated glassy fragments, carbon
blocks, and small and spongious grains are also found in coal fly ash
(Fig. 2e-f).

PFly ash constituents can be categorized as primary materials,
which arise from the original coal minerals (e.g. silicates, oxides, sul-
phates, phosphates, and carbonates); secondary materials, which
form during coal combustion; or tertiary materials, which result
from fly ash transport and storage (e.g. portlandite, brucite, gypsum,
calcite, dolomite, and amorphous material) [67].

PBased on the chemical and mineralogical composition, fly ash is
commonly classified as Class F or Class C [82]. Class F fly ash is char-
acterized by a total Si2O3, Fe2O3, and Al2O3 content greater than 70%
and a CaO content less than 5%; the percentage of unburned carbon
is generally high at (cid:1)6.0% and up to 12%. Class F ash is produced pre-
dominantly from bituminous and anthracite coal combustion and is
quite chemically reactive with alkaline materials (i.e. it generally
displays cementitious properties, which include high chemical reac-
tivity or the potential to be chemically activated). In contrast, Class C
ash is characterized by CaO content higher than 20% and is produced
by peat and lignite coal combustion processes. This class of waste
material possesses a low amount of unburned carbon. Due to their
considerable chemical and physical differences, Class F and Class C
ash are used differently [83]. Table 1 shows the normal range of the

minous, lignite and anthracite).

PAlthough fly ash classifications based on the ASTM C618 specifi-
cations are most commonly used, there are also other approaches,
which have been summarized by Vassilev and Vassileva [67] and are
briefly described below. Canada classifies fly ash based on CaO and
LOI contents. Fly ash is grouped according to CaO concentration into
Type F (<8%), Type CI (8%(cid:1)20%), or Type CH (>20%) or according to
LOI content into Type F ((cid:1)8% and up to 12%, based on performance)
or Types C, CI, or CH ((cid:3)6%) [67]. The UNO suggests a four-group

Pchemical classification for fly ash consisting of Group I, which
includes silico-aluminate fly ash with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio >2 and CaO
content <15%; Group II, which includes alumino-silicate fly ash with
a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio <2, CaO content <15%, and SO3 content <3%;
Group III, which includes lime sulphate fly ash with CaO content
>15% and SO3 content >3%; and Group IV, which includes basic fly
ash with CaO content >15% and SO3 content <3% [67]. Yet another

Palso be chemically classified as Sialic, Modic (or Ferrocalsialic), Fersic
(or Ferrosialic), Calsialic, Ferric, Fercalsic (or Ferrocalsic), and Calcic
[67]. The Russian classification system is based on coal type and
divides fly ash into four groups (for each acidic and basic fly ash
type), while the EU countries use the EN 450 standard (1995),
although each European country also has its own separate specifica-
tions.

PVassilev and Vassilleva [67] propose a new combined approach
based on the origin, mineral-chemical composition, properties, and
behaviour of fly ash; this new system begins by representing the
bulk chemical composition. The first system is organized taking into
account the contents, common geochemical associations, and any
significant positive or negative correlations between ash-forming
elements; one of four chemical fly ash types (Sialic, Calsialic, Ferri-
sialic, and Ferricalsialic) and one of three dominant tendencies (high
acid, medium acid, and low acid) are determined for the given sam-
ple (Fig. 3a). The second is based on the contents, associations, corre-
lations, properties, and behaviours of the minerals characterizing the
fly ash. This classification system distinguishes four phase-mineral
types of fly ash (Pozzolanic, Inert, Active, and Mixed) and three dom-
inant tendencies (high pozzolanic, medium pozzolanic, and low poz-
zolanic; Fig. 3b).

PFinally, fly ash is also chemically characterized by the presence of
trace elements, such as Se, Mo, Ni, As, Sb, Cd, Zn, Cr, Cu, and V, that
render the material potentially toxic [84(cid:1)90]. Borm [85] published a
review paper in which the presence of metals, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and silica were analysed and discussed as markers of
coal fly ash toxicity. Jegadeesan et al. [87] investigated the risks asso-
ciated with the reuse of coal fly ash by studying the mobility of As,
Cr, Pb, Fe, Cu, and Zn as function of pH. The authors conclude that
Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, and Fe are not leached under most pH conditions due
to their distribution among less soluble residual silicates. However,
extreme environmental conditions (pH < 4 and pH > 9) result in
arsenic mobilization due to dissolution at low pH or desorption at
high pH. In 1996, Querol et al. [90] demonstrated that trace element
mobility in coal fly ash depends on the elemental mode of occur-
rence; the authors show that most labile elements are associated
with oxides (as is the case for Ge, Mn, Mo, Se, V, W, and Zn) and salts
such as sulphates, borates, and arsenates. Elements with low extrac-
tion rates (including Cr, Ga, Rb, Sb, Sn, Th, Zr, and REE) are generally
found in more refractory phases. Large fractions of Mo, Sr, and V are
extractable in water and readily exchangeable.

P2.1.2. Biomass ash

PBiomass is a complex heterogeneous mixture of organic and inor-
ganic matter [48]. Biomass material arises mainly from wood (i.e.
wood and woody biomass) and herbaceous agricultural waste such
as grasses, flowers, straw, husks, pits (together, agricultural bio-
mass), although other specific waste materials (including commer-
cial and construction biomass waste such as demolition debris and
paper pellets), household and industrial organic waste, animal and
human biomass waste, and aquatic biomass (including algae) are
also included (Fig. 4).

PBiomass ash is comprised of the solid residue resulting from the
combustion of different types of biomass. As for coal, biomass ash
consists of fly ash and bottom ash, which are based on the location
of ash collection after the combustion process. Biomass fly ash con-
sists of the fine ash fraction (i.e. particles with a median size below
4 mm(cid:1)100 mm [91(cid:1)93]) that ``flies” from the biomass combustion
temperatures
chamber
between 800 °C and 1600 °C) and is captured by emission control
devices such as electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) [94,95].

(or boiler, which commonly features

PEven for a specific type of biomass, many factors, such as growing
processes and conditions, plant age, pesticide use, harvest time, soil
composition, and contamination, as well as the specific part of the
plant used, contribute to variations in ash composition [35,36,49,56,

tem of coal fly ash. P: pozzolanic; I: Inert; M: Mixed; and A: Active (adapted from ref-
erence [67]).

P95(cid:1)104]. Vassilev et al. [49] show that biomass ash may potentially
include the entire contents of the periodic table. However, the chem-
ical composition of biomass ash is generally dominated by a mixture
of SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO, K2O, P2O5, and SO3, although the relative
abundances of these compounds are influenced by the biomass type
[20,35,50,105,106]. Representative chemical compositions are given
for ash derived from 86 varieties of biomass divided into main
groups and sub-groups (such as specific grasses and straws among
the general herbaceous and agricultural biomass groups) by Vassilev
et al. [20,35]. Representative data are reported in Table 2 [35,107-
128].

Pcontrol variation in the chemical and mineralogical composition of
biomass ash [48,102,105,134,136-141]. Baxter et al. [102], in a paper
published in 1998, summarized the results of the comparative Alkali
Deposits Project (ADP), describing biomass ash characteristics and
combustion behaviour for many biomass fuels (e.g. wood and urban
wood fuels and agricultural residues); this study produced chemical
and physical data on ash deposits collected from several locations in
the boiler and focused on major inorganic species such as silicon,
potassium, calcium, sodium, aluminium, magnesium, and iron, as
well as sulphur, phosphorus, and chlorine. Trivendi et al. [142]
confirms that the combustion temperature is an important factor
in controlling ash products affecting the surface and pores of
biomass ash along with, of course, the chemical properties of the
biomass (Fig. 5).

PAs mentioned before, the origin of the mineral phases in biomass
ash is similar to that in coal ash [68,69]; therefore, the heavy metals
present in the biomass volatilize to some extent at combustion tem-
peratures and condense on the fine fraction of the fly ash when the
off-gassed material cools [20,143(cid:1)146]. Through this mechanism,
elements such as As, Cd, Pb, Ni, Hg, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn become
part of the chemical composition of ash; this process is one of the
most serious aspects of biomass conversion in terms of environmen-
tal risk [49,50,147]. The majority of these toxic elements are accu-
mulated in biomass through soil, pesticides, and fertilizers before
mobilization and volatilization during biomass combustion and the
the significant water-soluble phases
subsequent
detected in the final fly ash. The combustion conditions also control
the amount of unburned carbon in biomass fly ash, the proportion of
unburned material to inorganic material, and the nutrient concen-
tration [93,105,148,149]. Giron et al. [105] compared the properties
of ash produced from forest biomass combustion using two different
processes: a grate furnace and a fluidized bed; they conclude that
the latter is more efficient, as the fly ash is characterized by low
amounts of unburned carbon.

2.2. Effects of combustion processes on ash composition and properties

PIt is well known that combustion processes, among other factors,
influences both the composition and properties of ash. Coal and bio-
mass combustion produces coarse particles accumulated at the bot-
tom of combustion chamber (bottom ash) and a fine fraction (fly
ash) transported by flue gases into the chimney and collected by
electrostatic precipitators and fabric filters [150]. The final ash min-
eral composition, glass composition, portion of unburned carbon,
distribution of elements, and particle mass are influenced by the
combustion temperature, air-to-fuel ratio, coal particle size, and
combustion rate. Vassilev and Vassileva [80] correlated the fly ash
mineralogical composition with the combustion temperature.
Although the ash fusion temperatures of biomass are more variable
and generally lower than those of coal, the ash formation mecha-
nisms and phase-mineral transformations are comparable [69]. In a
recent review, Vassilev et al. [141] explained that greater concentra-
tions of Ca, Al, and Ti and lower K, Si, P, S, Fe, Na, and Mg contents
(excluding select highly enriched Si varieties) generally contribute
to increased biomass fusion temperatures (from about (cid:3)1100 °C to
(cid:3)°C). The authors also indicated the common ash formation mecha-
nisms in biomass, which can be represented by a sequential phase-
mineral transformation starting with the formation of intermediate
and less-stable chlorides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulphates, phos-
phates, and inorganic amorphous material and ending with the for-
mation of silicates and glass with variable salt content and the
carbonation of newly-formed phases during biomass ash cooling. In
a previous manuscript, these authors detailed the formation mecha-
nisms of glass, amorphous material, char, organic minerals, and
other inorganic phases in biomass fly ash with increases in combus-
tion temperature between 200 °C and 1500 °C [48]. They observed:

Fig. 4. Classification of biomass materials.

PAs far as the mineralogical composition is concerned, silicates,
oxides and hydroxides, sulphates, phosphates, carbonates, chlorides,
and nitrates are the main mineral phases [20,107,129(cid:1)134]. Sili-
cates, represented by quartz, cristobalite, feldspars, clay minerals,
opal, and, more rarely, pyroxenes-olivines, are mostly secondary in
biomass ash [20,79]; their origin is similar to that in coal ash, as
described by Vassileva et al. [68,69]. In addition, the oxide and
hydroxide formation mechanisms in biomass ash are comparable to
those in coal fly ash; these molecules typically originate from the
decomposition and oxidation of organic matter, oxalates, carbo-
nates, phosphates, sulphates, chlorides, and nitrates, and, to a lesser
extent, from melt crystallization during biomass combustion [20].
However, iron compounds (siderite and hematite) are abundant
only in forest residue ash. Hematite can be produced by the oxida-
tion of organic iron or siderite during the combustion process
[79,135]. Some oxy-hydroxides are primary minerals and can be
considered unchanged during combustion, as they have relatively
high decomposition and/or melting temperatures during heating
[20]. The mineralogical composition of biomass ash is also character-
ized by the presence of sulphates, which are commonly formed by
interactions between acidic gasses and oxides of the above elements
generated mostly from organic matter during biomass combustion
[20] and by newly-formed phosphates, which are attributed to inter-
actions between oxides and phosphorus. Phosphorous is generated
predominantly from organic matter during biomass combustion
[20]. Carbonate and amorphous material (glass) represent the final
two important mineral phases in biomass ash. Ca-based minerals
are present in biomass in the form of calcite, anhydrite, and dolomite
due to the high calcium content naturally occurring in (mainly)
wood [79]. Finally, glass, a secondary phase, forms from the fusion of
inorganic material in biomass during combustion and the following
abrupt cooling of the melt [20,93,136].

PCombustion processes, and in particular combustion duration
and temperature, constitute other important parameters that

PFor coal fly ash, many literature studies have focused on the
mechanism that determines the large amount of inorganic com-
pounds and toxic elements that vaporize and condense onto fly ash
particles during combustion at high temperatures (400 °C(cid:1)1500 °C).
Volatilization-condensation theory distinguishes three groups of
elements [151,152]: Group I elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti),
which are classified as `lithophiles’, show little or no enrichment in
smaller fly ash particles; Group II elements (As, Cd, Mu, Pb, Sb, and
Se) are defined as `chalcophiles’ and display increasing concentration
with decreasing particle size; and, finally, Group III elements (Be, Cu,
Ni, V, and Co) exhibit intermediate behaviour, being enriched in
smaller particles but to a lesser extent than elements in Group II.
However, combustion temperature affects the extent of volatilisa-
tion of mineral elements and thus changes the characteristics of the
ash produced [153]. The finer fly ash fractions are enriched in glass,
whereas minerals such as mullite, quartz, and lime characterize
coarser fractions. A schematic representation of the fly ash particle
formation mechanism is shown in Fig. 6.

PBased on the analysis above, we conclude that the combustion
temperature conditions the chemical and mineralogical composition

Pof ash and, as a consequence, their properties and their potential use
in the different contexts analysed in the following paragraph.

2.3. Diffuse fly ash utilization

PWith increasing coal power plant activity and the rapid develop-
ment of energy production from biomass [38,154(cid:1)157], the amount
of ash by-product generated has increased and become a serious
problem worldwide [50,158]. Therefore, extensive investigations are
underway worldwide to develop different fly ash utilization
approaches, many of which aim to transform the waste into an eco-
nomical new industrial source.

PAs such, fly ash direct application is widespread and includes ash
utilization in agricultural soil modification, roadway and pavement
construction, cement and concrete products, ceramic materials,
soil and water treatment, and catalytic applications [24,50,61,
63,89,98,159(cid:1)185]. In the past few years, studies on fly ash as a
potential source of rare earth elements (REEs) have also been per-
formed [186(cid:1)190]. Blisset et al. [189] show that the enrichment of
REEs together with Y and Sc (also known as ‘rare earth elements
with yttrium’, or ‘REY’) in coal fly ash provide a feasible REY source.
The authors focused their study on the speciation of these very use-
ful elements, showing that REY are generally associated with inor-
ganic matter. Specifically, La, Ce, Pr, and Nd are largely associated
with silicates and aluminosilicates, while the rest of the REEs
(excepting Sm and Yb) are associated with carbonates and sulphates.
Franus et al. [190] emphasised the importance of REE extraction

Pfrom fly ash and, with this aim, examined the REE content of coal fly
ash samples from ten Polish power plants.

PAccording to statistics provided by the American Coal Ash Associ-
ation (ACAA) from 2000 to 2012 [191], due to differences in ash com-
position and properties, the utilization of coal fly ash (which has an
average annual production of 67.6 Mt) ranged from 32% to 45%;
approximately 70%(cid:1)84% of this amount was used in construction
sectors and less than 1% was used in agriculture and soil modifica-
tion and stabilization. Similar reports were generated by the Euro-
pean Coal Combustion Products Association e.V (ECOBA) [95,191]. In
2003, 2004, 2006, and 2010, the utilization rates of fly ash in Euro-
pean countries (where the average annual production was 40.4 Mt)
ranged from 44% to 50%. In some European countries in which the
production of this raw material is generally low (e.g. about 2 Mt/y),
it is recycled completely; however, in Canada (6 Mt/y), Australia (10
Mt/y), the UK (15 Mt/y), and Germany (40 Mt/y), coal fly ash utiliza-
tion rates range between 50% and 85% [95]. In the three principal fly
ash-producing countries (India, China, and the USA, which produce
112 Mt/y, 100 Mt/y, and 75 Mt/y, respectively), the utilization rates
are low [95].

PAlthough biomass ash production is increasing and can be con-
sidered comparable with that of coal fly ash, data on both biomass
ash production and utilization are scarce. However, all ash use is
closely related to the ash chemical and mineral composition, as well
as the properties of the raw materials. In addition, the percentage of
unburned carbon predisposes the ash to certain fields of application
[92]. The application of fly ash must therefore be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis and include careful analysis many factors, such as
the highly variable composition and properties of biomass ash and
risks due to the potential presence of large amounts of toxic ele-
ments and/or water-soluble hazardous compounds in both coal and
biomass ash [79,92,102,141,192,193]. According to various regula-
tions, there are limits to the amount of heavy metals in fly ash that
may be use in different contexts [50,194(cid:1)196]. However, legislation
is not sufficient to entirely mitigate environmental risk, as other
parameters, such as the elemental mode of occurrence, content,
behaviour, and fate, are more important than the bulk element con-
centration (which is the only regulated value).

PThe following sections detail the utilization of both coal and bio-
mass fly ash, giving a brief description of research activities that

roots to penetrate soil layers, with subsequent positive effects on
vegetative grown. The positive effects of fly ash addition on soil
properties can also be attributed to fly ash pH, where the fly ash
interacts with acidic soils to cause the release of plant nutrients
[211(cid:1)216] and improve crop growth in low-fertility soils
[198,217(cid:1)222]. Matsi and Keramidas [211] investigated the use of
alkaline coal fly ash for acidic soil amendment with respect to phyto-
toxicity and environmental impacts. The experiments were per-
formed using two soils and two different samples of fly ash; the
results indicated that both pH and total biomass yield increased after
fly ash application in both soils. Moreover, the authors stated that
the cumulative plant uptake of boron and phosphorus in the two
acidic soils increased following fly ash application, and that the
increase in these elements, which occurred without corresponding
increases in the amount of B and P available in the soils, can be
attributed to better root development in the treated soils. However,
the authors stressed the need to carefully consider boron concentra-
tions in soil because of its potential toxicity to plants. The mobility
of inorganic and organic phosphorous is also affected by coal fly ash
application to soils and was studied by Seshandri et al. [220] through
column leaching experiments. Their results indicate that the pres-
ence of fly ash decreases the leaching of inorganic P and increases
the leaching of organic P in soil. The decreased leaching of inorganic
P is due to the presence of Ca in coal fly ash, which plays an impor-
tant role in the adsorption of inorganic phosphorous. The increased
leaching of organic P is connected to the mineralisation of organic
phosphorous according to the pH.

PInteresting, innovative uses of coal fly ash in agriculture include
use as a substrate for ornamental plant production [223(cid:1)226] and
insecticide applications [164,227]. Basu et al. [164], in their extensive
and complete review on the potential utilization of fly ash in agricul-
ture (among other applications), dedicate a paragraph to the use of
fly ash as a pesticide. The authors analyse abundant literature data
that show the effectiveness of fly ash in deterring pests from vegeta-
bles and, according to some of these results, indicate the ability of
ash to control crop pest larvae by affecting their mouthparts and
digestive systems. The authors also report on the prospect of using
fly ash as a dust insecticide and discuss results obtained on this topic.

fuse fly ash utilization approaches.

P2.3.1. Environmental uses of fly ash

PSoil amendment and agricultural use
PThe literature documents the extensive use of coal and biomass
ash to improve agricultural soil. Ash is used to support plant growth
by suppling nutrients and elements; improve the balance in the sys-
tem; improve texture, aeration, and water-holding capacity; reduce
Al, Mn, and Fe plant toxicity by decreasing the exchangeable Al, Mn,
and Fe content in acidic soils; and reduce the acidic leaching of haz-
ardous elements from soil into water by lessening their mobility and
bioavailability.

PThe application of coal fly ash amendment on soil has been per-
formed widely, and the beneficial effects on soil have been investi-
gated extensively [27,153,164,173,197(cid:1)200]. However, research
and new approaches are still needed for, primarily, full-scale appli-
cations and the replacement of trace elements in soil to improve the
soil mineral content [26]. The use of fly ash as a source of essential
plant nutrients has been documented widely. Kumar et al. [201]
show that fly ash consists of all of the elements present in soil,
including essential macro- and micronutrients such as P, K, Ca, Mg,

PIn spite of the advantages of using fly ash in agricultural fields,
adverse effects have also been documented, most of which are con-
nected to the high levels of soluble salts, which inhibit microbial res-
piration and enzymatic activity, and the presence of potentially toxic
trace elements [27,153,211,228(cid:1)236]. In a manuscript published in
1990, Pichtel [232] investigated, among other subjects, the influence
of ash pH, electrical conductivity, and the concentrations of poten-
tially toxic ions on microbial respiration; the results indicate that
high fly ash pH is responsible for decreases in microbial respiration,
whereas soil electrical conductivity and concentrations of boron,
molybdenum, and soluble anions are not closely associated with res-
piration inhibition. These data, like those from other studies, indicate
that the positive and negative effects of fly ash use are firmly con-
nected with the amount and duration of ash use, as well as the fly
ash and soil properties and types and the climatic conditions [217].

PBiomass fly ash utilization in agriculture and soil amendment has
been extensively investigated. Vassilev et al. [50] indicate that the
addition of biomass ash (e.g. wood ash, forest residue, straw, meat-
bone meal, shells, olive residues, and rice husk ash) produces higher
pH and salinity as well as lower mobilization and bioavailability of
hazardous elements. Moreover, amendment with biomass ash
enhances the biological activity of some microorganisms and
improves the texture, aeration, and water-holding capacity of soil.
However, the authors emphasise that biomass ash soil amendment
requires long-term monitoring and careful analysis of risks arising
from the potential occurrence of hazardous trace elements, salinity
problems, pH shock, and plant damage from chemical burns. Numer-
ous studies have been performed on the influence of ash from spe-
cific biomass types, such as wood ash, on soil properties and
nutrient uptake [148]. Demeyer et al. [98] show that wood ash appli-
cation drives increases in the contents of most major elements (e.g.
P, Ca, Mg, K, and B) and decreases in Al, as well as minor element,
availability. The authors conclude that wood ash amendment is
appropriate for the management of tropical acidic soils as well as
forests in the Northern hemisphere. They stress that the application
of wood ash in agriculture and silviculture does not present major
environmental risks as long as excessive amounts are not applied
and only ash from the burning of pure wood (i.e. ash that originates
solely from the burning of forest residues or untreated wood) is
used. Goodwin and Burrow [237] also show that wood ash amend-
ment improves the physical properties of forest soils, while other
authors [104,148] confirm that the use of wood ash as a soil amend-
ment is predominantly governed by the amount and rate of applica-
tion, as well as the soil type. Wood ash may contain several harmful
organic compounds and variable concentrations of heavy metals,
which are potentially toxic to humans and the environment
[98,104,238(cid:1)241].

PEnvironmental remediation
PCoal fly ash has been widely used as an adsorptive material for
inorganic and organic contaminants in polluted water, and studies
indicate that the removal efficiency is generally dependent on the
properties (surface area, porosity, and CaO percentage), carbon con-
tent, and amount of fly ash used [242,243], as well as the concentra-
tion of toxic elements, pH, temperature, and contact time [244].

[162,262(cid:1)264], showing the important

PSeveral authors have shown fly ash to have good adsorption
capacity for heavy metals such as Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn
[245(cid:1)261], and this material has also been evaluated for As and
Hg removal
role of
unburned carbon in elemental mercury adsorption [265(cid:1)268].
However, although the retention of mercury by coal fly ash has
attracted the attention of many scientists, the exact nature of
the mercury-fly ash and mercury-unburned carbon interactions
is still unknown; all of the variables involved should be further
investigated. Ahmaruzzaman [26] provides a quite satisfactory
overview of the topic.

PThe utilisation of fly ash in the treatment phosphorus and humic
acid in aqueous solution has also been frequently examined in litera-
ture [24,166,269(cid:1)272]; some authors have focused on the relation-
ship between the phosphate retention mechanism and calcium
content in fly ash.

PUsing fly ash with high and low calcium contents, Cheung and
Venkitachalam [273] conclude that phosphate removal is primarily
achieved through the precipitation of phosphate with CaO ions in
solution. The removal of phosphate by a medium-calcium fly ash
takes place predominantly through the precipitation mechanism,
ion exchange, and weak physical interactions between the adsorbent
surfaces and metallic phosphate salts [274]. Singh [275] investigated
the adsorption of herbicides by fly ash, while other studies have dis-
cussed the pesticide sorption potential of coal fly ash [276(cid:1)279].

PFinally, the literature documents successful coal fly ash utiliza-
tion for heavy metal immobilization in polluted soils. Kumpiene
et al. [280] demonstrated that soil amendment with fly ash reduced
the leaching of Cu and Pb by 96% and 97%, respectively, and these
data have been confirmed by numerous other laboratory and field
experiments [281,282].

and

elements

PDue to their chemical and mineralogical composition, biomass
ash has also been successfully used as an adsorbent for the removal
of inorganic (As, Au, B, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, F, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and/
or organic (e.g.amines, organophosphates, phenols, toluene, and pes-
ticides)
from polluted water
compounds
[109,283(cid:1)285]. The literature has shown that, under alkaline condi-
tions, some biomass ash minerals exhibit a negative surface charge
and thus adsorb or precipitate positively-charged metal ions in
aqueous solution [286]. Among the types of biomass, rice husk ash
has been widely studied for wastewater treatment and metal ion
adsorption kinetics [110,287(cid:1)290]. Gupta et al. [291] used other
types of biomass (specifically, bagasse fly ash) to investigate Cd and
Ni removal from wastewater ash, while Srivastava et al. [292] deter-
mined an equilibrium model for these elements.

these

composition of

PThe literature data indicate that the cement and concrete indus-
tries are the predominant consumers of fly ash due to the chemical
and mineralogical
residue materials
[21,26,50,293,294]. The pozzolanic properties of fly ash allow its use
as partial replacement for clinker, the major component in ordinary
Portland cement, as has been widely documented in the literature
[181,293,295,296]. Due to the morphology of fine and spherical par-
ticles, the use of fly ash in concrete produces lower permeability
and, when using Class F fly ash in particular, a lower heat of hydra-
tion [297(cid:1)302]. Moreover, the literature has shown that coal fly ash
improves concrete workability without compromising strength,
which should encourage fly ash utilization in fibre-reinforced con-
crete [244].

PWhen used in cementitious materials, fly ash generally consti-
tutes about 15%(cid:1)25%; however, high volume fly ash (HVFA) con-
crete, which contains more than 50% fly ash, has also been widely
studied. HVFA exhibits excellent mechanical properties [303,304],
very low permeability to chloride ions [305,306], high rheological
constants [307,308], high abrasion resistance [309(cid:1)311], and high
corrosion resistance [306,312]. Nassar et al. [313], who used HVFA
concrete in pavement construction, demonstrate that this material
forms a denser and less permeable microstructure because of pozzo-
lanic reaction involving fly ash and the filling effect of submicron fly
ash particles. Moreover, these authors show that this new material
displays enhanced sorption, chloride permeability, and abrasion
resistance.

PUnfortunately, other studies have documented negative effects,
such as low workability and strength, in some types of concrete with
more than 50% fly ash [172,314]. To achieve desirable concrete char-
acteristics, researchers have proposed various methods, such as the

Paddition of nano- and micro-particle calcium carbonate [172,315]
and the incorporation of nanosilicates and silica fumes [316]. Hema-
latha et al. [172] performed laboratory experiments to determine
the mechanical responses of fly ash mixes at various percentages
ranging from 0% to 80%, finding that a decrease in strength occurs at
all curing stages with increasing fly ash content; the decrease in
strength is attributed to reduced calcium hydroxide production in
cement rich in fly ash, an increased water-to-cement ratio, or both.
After much effort, the authors overcame the deficiencies induced by
high volume fly ash replacement by incorporating nano- and micro-
particle calcium carbonate. However, the authors conclude that, in
order to utilize high volume fly ash in cement composites without
affecting the required concrete properties, it is necessary to compre-
hensively study the microstructural behaviour and chemical kinet-
ics. Moreover, the amount of calcium carbonate added to HVFA
concretes must be optimized for each replacement level in order to
reap maximum benefits.

PThe use of biomass and mixed coal-biomass ash in cement has
also been widely investigated [92,179,317], although Vassilev et al.
[20] stated that, according to some standards (e.g. ASTM C618, En-
450, and En 197-1), the use of biomass ash as a concrete additive is
constrained if not completely precluded by quantity and quality.
However, various papers have indicated that construction compo-
sites produced from various types of biomass ash are comparatively
cheaper, have lower thermal conductivity, and are durable, light-
weight, and environmentally friendly in comparison to coal fly ash.

PDue to its pozzolanic kinetic properties, many studies have
described the successful application of bagasse ash as a cement
replacement in concrete [293,318(cid:1)322]. Suvimol and Daungruedee
[323] demonstrated good cement properties underground ash
replacement ranging from 20% to 40%. Jaturapitakkul [324] also
revealed the pozzolanic properties of biomass ash such as palm oil
fuel ash, and documented that its use improves the sulphate resis-
tance of concrete. In addition, the filling effect of the ultrafine par-
ticles contained in palm oil fuel ash further decreases the porosity of
concrete, lowering its permeability to chloride, air, and water [325].
Finally, a number of recent papers have discussed the application of
rice husk ash in concrete industry; this biomass ash enhances
strength and reduces water adsorption in concrete [159,326(cid:1)329].
Tuan et al. [330] demonstrate that the utilization of rice husk ash
with a mean particle size of 3.6 mm(cid:1)9 mm produces ultra-high-per-
formance concrete, and that, compared to the effects of silica fumes,
this biomass residue is more effective for the development of UHPC
compressive strength. Rukzon et al. [331] also show that high-per-
formance concretes can be produced through ultrafine rice husk ash
replacement at 10%, 15%, and 20%; the authors indicate that the
strongest performance is obtained at 20% replacement, although
Cordeiro et al. [332] found that concrete workability decreases as
the percentage of cement replaced with rice husk ash increases.
However, Chao-Lung et al. [333] found that the addition of rice husk
ash up to 20% does not generate adverse effects on the strength and
durability of the concrete. A number of studies have also analysed
the effects of
rice husk ash on self-consolidating concrete
[326,334(cid:1)337].

P2.3.3. Ceramic industry

POver the last few years, vitrification has been considered for the
conversion of waste into useful new raw material; fly ash is a good
candidate for vitrification methods. The chemical and mineralogical
composition of coal fly ash, characterized primarily by SiO2, Al2O3,
CaO, and Fe2O3, makes it particularly suitable for the manufacture of
glass-ceramics [338(cid:1)340], although Erol et al. [169] also show good
coal fly ash performance in the production of glass and ceramic
materials with no additives and almost no pre-treatment. Similar
results have also been obtained by other authors using additive
materials, and the final products possess physical and chemical

Pproperties comparable to literature values for ceramics derived from
non-waste sources [341(cid:1)345]. Moreover, in some cases, coal fly ash
mixed with traditional raw material displays improved physical and
mechanical properties compared to ‘normal’ ceramic products [346].
Numerous papers have documented the use of coal fly ash as a
replacement for kaolinite in the manufacture of ceramic cordierite
[347,348], pressed ceramic tiles [349,350], and fired bricks with a
crushing strength compared to normal clay bricks [175,351]. In
addition, due to the properties and attractive appearance of
select glass-ceramics, which can be similar to those of natural
granites and marbles, these materials have also been applied in
wall-covering panels, floors, roofs, and so on in industrial and
public buildings [352(cid:1)355].

PRice husk and other biomass ash (e.g. sugar cane bagasse ash) is
also used in the production of ceramic materials, mainly in ceramic
brick manufacture [356(cid:1)360]. To a lesser degree, rice husk ash has
been used in the generic ceramic sector [361(cid:1)366]. Recently, Eliche-
Quesada et al. [367] published a paper in which they demonstrate
the feasibility of using rice husk and wood fly ash as a substitute for
clay in high-quality bricks. The authors show that it is possible to
produce ceramic bricks that equal the technological standards and
mechanical properties of control bricks using 20 wt% of wood ash,
and demonstrate that the use of rice husk and wood ash makes clay
bricks lighter. However, the authors also indicate that a maximum of
10 wt% rice husk ash can be used to produce bricks that meet water
adsorption standards. Regarding glass-ceramic production, select
papers have documented the use of rice husk ash to synthesise lith-
ium aluminium silicate [368]. In a recent manuscript, Andreola et al.
[160] demonstrate the ability to produce nepheline-forsterite-based
glass-ceramics using rice husk ash as the main silica raw material;
the authors report that the bending strength values and Mohs hard-
ness of the product are, respectively, similar to and higher than com-
mercial glass-ceramics and showed that materials obtained by
thermal treatment at 900 °C have a density similar to the nepheline
density reported in the literature. Moreover, the results indicate that
the presence of a high amount of nepheline (due to the use of bio-
mass fly ash) conferred medium chemical resistance upon the pro-
duced glass-ceramic material.

P2.3.4. Catalysis

PAs described previously, the chemical and mineralogical compo-
sition of coal fly ash consists of various metal oxides (and mainly
iron oxides) that render this residue material usable as a catalyst for
reactions in the gas, liquid, and solid phases [21,185,369]. Several
studies have documented the use of fly ash as a catalyst in deSOx,
deNOx, H2, hydrocracking, and hydrocarbon oxidation [370(cid:1)374];
this broad range of possible applications is owed to the chemical
composition of fly ash (characterized by Al2O3 and SiO2), which
offers desirable thermal stability. Balakrishnan et al. [374] describe
in their review paper the use of high volumes of waste materials (e.
g. coal fly ash and rice husk ash) in catalysis and for catalyst synthe-
sis. As to fly ash, the authors discuss several studies that examine
the use of coal fly ash as a catalytic support, and emphasise the
necessity of surface area enhancement (with thermal treatment,
chemical treatment, or both) prior to the loading of active phases.
The authors also refer to recent literature data showing the role of
iron oxide content in fly ash for certain catalytic applications. Fly
ash-supported CaO has also been employed for condensation reac-
tions [375] and the transesterification of soybean oil [376], while
coal fly ash loaded with sulphated zirconia forms a solid acid catalyst
used in numerous processes [173,377]. However, according to Wang
[185], although coal fly ash catalysis provides an interesting, cost-
effective, and environmentally friendly approach to fly ash recycling,
fly ash catalysts have not been applied in industrial practice and
require more study investigating their performance and long-term
stability.

Fig. 8. Zeolite framework of tetrahedral [SiO4]4¡, with the Si-Al substitution yielding
a negative charge (adapted from reference [84]).

PAmong the various types of biomass ash, rice husk has been used
as a catalyst and catalyst support for several reactions. A number of
studies show the utilization of rice husk-supported Ni and Cu for cat-
alyst in hydrogenetation [378(cid:1)382] as well as oxalic acid ozonation
catalysis [383].

3. Part II. Overview of zeolite synthesis from ash

PCoal and biomass are good substrates for the zeolite synthesis
due to their composition, which is characterized by aluminosilicate
and silicate phases. Holler and Wirsching [384] can be considered
the pioneers in the use of coal fly ash as Al and Si sources for zeolite
synthesis. Several other authors have studied zeolite synthesis from
coal fly ash, while very few studies have documented the conversion
of biomass fly ash into zeolite; these studies predominantly involve
the use of rice husk ash.

PZeolites are microporous crystalline hydrated aluminosilicates
characterised by a three-dimensional network of tetrahedral (Si, Al)
O4 units that form a system of interconnected pores. The aluminium
ion produces a net negative charge, which is balanced by the pres-
ence of an extra cation in the framework (Figs. 8 and 9). Due to this
structure, zeolites have a number of physicochemical properties that
make them very useful in a variety of applications. Specifically, zeo-
lites are characterized by the correlation of physical properties,
namely specific surface and bulk density, with porosity and cation
exchange capacity (CEC). The latter, in association with adsorption
capacity, is one of the most important chemical properties of these
minerals. The thermal properties of zeolites include temperature
resistance, thermal stability, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity.
PThe type and amount of zeolite formed results from the combina-
tion of different conditions and parameters such as temperature,
pressure, solution alkalinity, activation solution-to-fly ash ratio, and
formation process. The second part of this review investigates the
major methods that have been used to synthesise zeolites from com-
bustion residue materials and explores the effects of each of the
aforementioned parameters and the advantages and limitations of
each synthesis process. The main applications of these synthetic
products are also briefly discussed.

3.1. Synthesis processes

PThe synthesis of zeolite is generally performed in closed reaction
systems in which aluminate and silicate solutions are mixed and sub-
jected to elevated temperatures (30 °C(cid:1)180 °C) for various periods of
time (minutes to days), producing a super-saturated solution that
undergoes spontaneous nucleation and crystallization processes.
Fig. 10 shows a simplified scheme of the coal fly ash zeolitization
mechanism based on Al and Si dissolution, geopolymer formation,
crystalline structure nucleation, and, finally, zeolite crystal growth.

In following experiments, Querol et al.

Ppublished one of their numerous papers on zeolite synthesis from
coal fly ash by alkaline hydrothermal methods [385,393,394]. The
authors analysed the synthesis of zeolite as a function of the fly ash-
to-solution ratio, solution chemistry, and reaction time. They show
that the volume, type, and crystalline size of the newly-formed min-
erals depends on the reaction time and the fly ash-to-solution ratio
as well as the chemical and mineralogical composition of the raw
materials [395]. They find that aluminosilicate glass is the main reac-
tive phase of fly ash in zeolite synthesis and confirm the low reactiv-
ity of mullite.
[393]
distinguished two different zeolite crystal growth processes, includ-
ing 1) those occurring under short activation periods at low temper-
atures and involving pure alkaline activation of the aluminosilicate
glass, and 2) those occurring under long activation periods at higher
temperatures and involving the dissolution of SiO2 and Al2O3 from
quartz, mullite, and aluminosilicate glass. The authors demonstrated
that differences in the types of zeolite synthesised using fly ash with
similar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios and the same activation conditions were
caused by differences in the mineralogical composition (in samples
with the same bulk chemical composition). With the goal of eluci-
dating the major features influencing the utilization of fly ash for
zeolite synthesis, Querol et al. [394] also investigated the physical,
chemical, and mineralogical properties of 14 samples of Spanish fly
ash and performed experiments at the pilot-plant scale [385]. Zhao
et al. [396] analysed the effect of ageing and seeding on the forma-
tion of zeolite from coal fly ash; their data indicate that ageing plays
important roles in both Si and Al dissolution into basic solutions to
form rinh-like structures and, further, zeolite formation. Seeding
selectively induces the formation of a specific zeolite in the absence
of other impurities and eliminates the induction and nucleation pro-
cesses. The literature documents many other studies on condition
optimization for zeolite formation using coal fly ash, and most of
these show that faujasite, sodalite and hydroxysodalite, P zeolite,
and A-type zeolite dominate the newly-formed zeolite types
[397(cid:1)406]. Fig. 12 shows typical SEM images of these zeolites. In
Tanaka et al. [407], Na-A zeolite formed as a single phase when the
SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of the coal fly ash solutions was modified in
the range of 1.0 (cid:3) SiO2/Al2O3 (cid:3) 2.0, while Na-X zeolite crystallised at
SiO2/Al2O3 (cid:1) 2.5. Murayama et al. [408] studied the zeolite synthesis
mechanism, showing that the dissolution of amorphous aluminosili-
cates (which characterize the coal fly ash composition) determines
changes in the Al3+ and Si4+ concentrations in the liquid phase dur-
ing the hydrothermal reaction. As the concentrations of these ele-
ments increase, the ions condense to form an aluminosilicate gel, a
sort of pre-form of the zeolite crystal that is more reactive with
increasing temperature. As the condensation reaction proceeds, the
aluminosilicate gel rapidly begins to deposit on the particle surface
(like a large flake) and transform into zeolite crystals. Inada et al.
[409] focused on the mechanism controlling coal fly ash conversion
into zeolites via hydrothermal alkaline treatment and proposed the
dissolution-precipitation process. The authors show that hydroxyso-
dalite forms using silica-lean fly ash at high NaOH concentration,
while a moderate NaOH concentration, in association with high and
low concentrations of Si and Al, respectively, is required for the crys-
tallization of Na-P zeolite. The conventional hydrothermal method
has recently been improved using more sophisticated treatments,
some of which are analysed in the following paragraphs.

PThe mineralogical and chemical composition of biomass ash is
characterized by a generally high amount of silica, which permitting
the use of these residues for the zeolite synthesis. However, this
topic is understudied. Most relevant projects focus on zeolite syn-
thesis from rice husk ash using hydrothermal processes with organic
structure-directing agents [410(cid:1)417]. Among these, Ng et al. [418]
recently published a paper in which amorphous silica from rice husk
ash was transformed into nanosized crystalline EMT-type zeolite
under a very low incubation temperature (28 °C) and short

Fig. 11. Schematic of the experimental methods for the synthesis of zeolite from coal
fly ash.

PThe main zeolite synthesis processes include: (1) the conventional
hydrothermal process; (2) the alkaline fusion-assisted hydrothermal
process; (3) multi-step treatment; (4) microwave heating; and (5) the
sonication approach (Fig. 11). In this section, the literature on each
approach is analysed, focusing on the processes and parameters that
influence the type of zeolite formed from ash as well as the key fac-
tors in and main drawbacks of each method. The data are derived
from laboratory scale experiments; some research on zeolite synthesis
from fly ash at meso- and pilot-scales has been performed [385(cid:1)388].

PThe most innovative studies on zeolite synthesis from coal fly ash
were performed between the nineties and the first half of the 2000s.
During those years, Mondragon et al. [389] published the first com-
parative results of alkaline treatment of coal combustion ash. The
experiments were performed with various concentrations of sodium
hydroxide (from 2.0 to 13.0 molar) at different temperatures (90 °
C(cid:1)100 °C) and for different periods of time (8 h(cid:1)48 h) using distilled
water. The results indicate that amorphous material present in the
ash is transformed chiefly into crystalline phases taking the form of
zeolite X, although also zeolite P and hydroxysodalite also form. Due
to the presence of undesirable components, the fly ash was also
treated with acid (HCl or H2SO4) to reduce the concentration of iron
and alkaline oxides located on the outer surfaces of the ash particles.
The results show that acid treatment improves zeolite synthesis,
probably due to a higher concentration of silica and aluminium in
the acid-treated samples, but negatively impacts the adsorptive
properties of the final products. A few years later, Singer and Berk-
gaut [390] analysed the hydrothermal treatment behaviour of two
different coal fly ash samples and concluded that solid residues can
be converted in a new material with a high cation exchange capacity
characterized by » 50% zeolite material. These authors confirm
results previously obtained by Catalfamo et al. [391] and show that
the presence of mullite and, subordinately, quartz, affect the yield of
zeolite. Lin and Hsi [392] analysed the effect of temperature on zeo-
lite formation in a Na2O-K2O-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O system, showing that
different phases of zeolite are synthesised under changing incuba-
tion temperatures; in their experiments, zeolite P formed at a lower
temperature (» 70 °C), analcime was synthesised at 150 °C, hydroxy-
sodalite crystallized when the temperature was increased to 170 °C,
and, finally, that cancrinite was the only zeolite identified at a higher

Phydrothermal treatment duration (28 h). Mineral formation took
place via dissolution of the biomass ash silica in a highly basic media,
followed by EMT zeolite crystallization. The few publications on the
use of biomass ash for zeolite synthesis include: a manuscript by
Jim(cid:1)enez et al. [419] that documents the synthesis of analcime and
other phases via the hydrothermal treatment of biomass ash from a
fluidized-bed forest combustor; a discussion in Vichaphund et al.
[420] of the utilization of fly ash from the pulp and paper industries
to synthesise ZSM-5 zeolite; and the research of Worathanakul and
Tobarameeku [421], which aimed to synthesize NaY zeolite using
bagasse ash as a silica source.

PKey factors and issues: a brief summary
PA typical flow chart for the conventional hydrothermal process is
shown in Fig. 13. Deterministic factors affecting the type and crystal-
linity of synthetic zeolite formed during hydrothermal processes
include the treatment time, temperature, raw ash chemical compo-
sition, type of alkaline hydroxide, alkaline concentration, and liquid-
to-solid ratio; Si and Al (which dissolve from fly ash) concentrations
are also considered a determining factor in zeolite crystallization.
However, although hydrothermal treatment is performed at high

Ptemperatures that facilitate Si dissolution in alkaline media (and
also involve slow quartz dissolution), only part of the Si derived
from the chemical-mineralogical composition of the fly ash can be
considered reactive. Moreover, Al component dissolution is lower
than Si dissolution. The fact that mullite is inert in alkaline media
explains the different behaviours of these elements. It can thus be
inferred that 1) only a small amount of the reactive Al2O3 in fly ash
contributes to zeolite formation, and 2) the amounts of reactive ele-
ments are limited during a typical hydrothermal process. This results
in low zeolite yields and the presence of unreacted fly ash material
in the final product, which constitute the main disadvantages of the
hydrothermal process.

P3.1.2. The alkaline fusion-assisted hydrothermal process

PProcess
PShigemoto et al. [422] introduced a method for the solid alkali
pre-fusion of coal fly ash at high temperatures (>500 °C) prior to the
conventional hydrothermal process, showing that fusion with sodium
hydroxide at 550 °C can convert fly ash particles into Na silicate-alu-
in favourable Na-X zeolite formation via
minate and result

Pbe converted into large amounts of silicate and aluminosilicate.
These new phases are very soluble in alkaline solutions, producing
high concentrations of Si and Al that can then participate in zeolite
crystallization formation during the subsequent hydrothermal reac-
tion. In this way, the formation of zeolite is facilitated and the
amount of mineral formed is increased. Moreover, the successful
application of this fusion approach to different types of ash has been
well documented, as has the zeolite yield resulting from various
types of fly ash. The hydrothermal incubation temperature, Si/Al
ratio of the precursor solution, and fly ash-to-alkaline hydroxide sol-
ids ratio are key factors in the formation of selected zeolites using
the alkaline fusion-assisted hydrothermal process. The pre-fusion
treatment, which constitutes the advantage of the method, can also
been regarded as an issue because it increases the cost of the method
due to the high temperatures required (500 °C(cid:1)600 °C). Fig. 14
shows a flowchart of the pre-fusion hydrothermal synthesis process.

P3.1.3. The multi-step treatment method

PProcess
PThe literature documents numerous variations on conventional
and pre-fusion hydrothermal methods that aim to control the syn-
thesis of a single zeolite or increase the amount of minerals formed
using coal fly ash as the raw material. Select authors have described

Phydrothermal reaction without stirring. This mechanism was also
investigated by Berkgaut and Singer [423], who show that an endo-
thermic reaction takes place at 170 °C(cid:1)180 °C during fly ash fusion
with NaOH that results in the formation of Na aluminosilicate. This
final product interacts with water, giving aluminosilicate gel, which
can be transformed into P-type zeolite upon hydrothermal treatment
at 100 °C without aging; X-type zeolite forms after aging for 12 hours.
Chang and Shih [424] studied the conversion of three coal fly ash
samples into zeolite P, zeolite A, and faujasite using the pre-fusion
treatment. They demonstrate that the fusion of fly ash with NaOH
produces sodium silicate and amorphous aluminosilicate, which can
be easily dissolved in aqueous solution, increasing the amount of Si
and Al species in solution and enhancing zeolite synthesis. Further-
more, the authors find that Al species control the synthesis process;
once the Al species are consumed, zeolite is no longer produced. A
few years later, the same authors published a new manuscript in
which they proposed a modified fusion process to form zeolite A and
zeolite X from coal fly ash [425]. They found that the addition of alu-
minium hydroxide to the fused fly ash solution, followed by hydro-
thermal treatment at a low temperature (60 °C), produces a mixture
of zeolite A and zeolite X or a single type of zeolite A according to
the composition of fly ash used. With these results, the authors con-
firm the limiting role of dissolved Al species in the precursor solution
derived from fused fly ash. Rayalu et al. [426] focused their research
on the effects of NaOH concentration on fly ash conversion and the
types of zeolite formed, indicating that insufficient alkali concentra-
tions lead to minimal alumino-silicate extraction from fly ash, which
adversely affects the zeolite crystallization process. Excessive alkaline
enrichment, however, leads to the transformation of zeolite formed
under optimal alkalinity into hydroxysodalite. Molina and Poole
[427] compared the conventional hydrothermal technique with the
pre-fusion hydrothermal method, concluding that the fusion method
results in shorter synthesis times and high product crystallinity.
Numerous experiments on zeolite synthesis from different coal fly
ash samples using alkaline fusion combined with hydrothermal treat-
ment were performed by Somerset et al. [428(cid:1)430]; interest has
recently been renewed in this method [431(cid:1)440].

PKey factors and issues: a brief summary
PThe literature agrees that fly ash pre-fusion treatment improves
zeolites synthesis performance. Indeed, numerous experiments have
demonstrated that, via fusion with alkaline hydroxides, fly ash can

Pprocesses based on the addition of external silica, observing higher
reactivity in the silica-enriched mixture, which favours the forma-
tion of a more stable zeolite via faster nucleation [397]. Other studies
have investigated the synthesis of zeolite using two-step methods
involving an initial silicon and aluminium extraction stage and a sec-
ond zeolite hydrothermal synthesis step [441(cid:1)446]. Processes
involving step-wise changes in temperature during hydrothermal
treatment have also been performed [447].

PAmong the non-conventional zeolite synthesis methods, the mol-
ten-salt method proposed by Park et al. [448,449] is well known in
the community. The authors formed sodalite and cancrinite from
coal fly ash using molten salt mixtures (including NaOH-NaNO3,
NaOH-KNO3, and NH4F-NH4NO3) without the addition of water;
NaOH, KOH, or NH4NO3 were employed as bases (or mineralisers),
while NaNO3, KNO3, or NH4NO3 were used as stabilizers.

PVery few experiments on the utilization of biomass ash as a raw
material have been performed, but among those that have, the

Pmanuscript of Pengthamkeerati et al. [450] should be mentioned; it
describes the synthesis of nanocrystalline silicalite-1 from a silica
source extracted from biomass ash and analyses and discusses the
synthesis of zeolite via a multi-step treatment.

PKey factors and issues: a brief summary
PThe community has long debated technical and general issues
surrounding zeolite synthesis by conventional and pre-fusion
hydrothermal processes, sometimes finding solutions in multi-
step and non-conventional treatments.
In many cases, these
methods are modifications of well-known hydrothermal meth-
ods. These processes are generally characterised by an increase
in solution, which engenders not only a lower
in Si and Al
amount of residual unreacted coal fly ash material, but also the
synthesis of the selected ‘pure zeolite’. The higher costs, rather
complex procedures, and longer preparation period are regarded
as the main concerns pertaining to these methods. Figs. 15a and

method’, respectively.

P3.1.4. Microwave irradiation

PProcess
PThe use of microwave heating for the synthesis of zeolite from
coal fly ash has been documented in a large number of published
papers. Querol et al. [451] compared the results of zeolite synthesis
performed via conventional and microwave-assisted hydrothermal
methods and concluded that, though the yields and types of zeolite
synthesised with the two methods were quite similar, the required
activation time was drastically reduced by the use of microwaves
(from 24 h(cid:1)48 h to 30 min). Andress et al. [452] confirm these
results, showing that process of obtaining Na-P1 from coal fly ash is
optimized in a closed system in a microwave oven. Inada et al. [453]
formed Na-P1 from coal fly ash by applying microwave irradiation
followed by conventional hydrothermal alkaline treatment. The
authors investigated the effects of microwave heating during the zeo-
litization process under the assumption that the zeolitization mecha-
nism could be divided into three parts, including early SiO2 and
Al2O3 dissolution in alkaline solution, intermediate aluminosilicate
gel formation (by the deposition of dissolved Si and Al species), and
final gel transformation with zeolite crystal growth. They demon-
strated that continuous microwave irradiation retards the formation
of zeolite in crystalline form, whereas partial microwave irradiation
exhibits various influences. Early-stage microwave heating enhances
zeolite formation due to increases in SiO2 and Al2O3 dissolution; in
contrast, microwave irradiation during the middle stage hinders the
nucleation of the intermediate aluminosilicate gel, retarding zeolite
synthesis. A few years later, Tanaka et al. [454] developed a method
for the rapid synthesis of Na-A zeolite from fly ash using a household
microwave. The process involves an initial step during which amor-
phous aluminosilicate from milled fly ash is dissolved under micro-
wave irradiation to extract Si4+ and Al3+ and a second step in which
zeolite crystallization is achieved under microwave heating for
60 min. Recently, experiments for microwave synthesis of LTA zeolite
were performed by Behin et al. [455]. Applying microwave irradia-
tion at a relatively low power of 100 W(cid:1)300 W for a short period of
time (10 min(cid:1)30 min) and using coal fly ash and wastewater as solid
and liquid industrial wastes, respectively, it was possible to form zeo-
lite with a relatively high CEC and good adsorption capacity. The abil-
ity of microwave irradiation to accelerate fly ash zeolitization from
several hours to a few minutes has been documented by Bukhari
et al. [456], who, to the best of our knowledge, published only one
paper that describes the utilization of microwave heating in hydro-
thermal synthesis after the fusion step.

PKey factors and issues: a brief summary
PAccording to the literature, the main advantages of the microwave
heating method include the acceleration of SiO2 and Al2O3 dissolution
in aqueous solution and the ensuing reduction of the zeolite activa-
tion time to minutes. Microwave heating also results in the produc-
tion of smaller zeolite crystals. Therefore, it is evident that the key
factor in this process is the rapid and homogenous heating produced
by microwave radiation, which makes the zeolitization of fly ash an
economically viable process. However, research on this method has
been conducted only at the laboratory scale, and significant research
will be needed to apply the process at an industrial scale; this is the
greatest drawback of this interesting method. A flowchart of the
microwave zeolite synthesis method is shown in Fig. 16.

P3.1.5. The sonication approach

PProcess
PThe last few years have featured numerous works on ultrasonic
treatment during zeolite synthesis from fly ash due to the ability of

Fig. 16. Flowchart describing the conventional microwave heating steps.

Pultrasonic treatment to accelerate Al and Si dissolution in the amor-
phous aluminosilicate, strengthen bonds at the solid particle-gel
phase interface, enhance the polycondensation process, and improve
the transition of semi-crystalline to crystalline phases [16,457,458].
Woolard et al. [459] formed hydroxysodalite from coal fly ash with
an ultrasound-assisted hydrothermal method, while Musyoka et al.
[460] formed zeolite A through the application of the fusion method
followed by an ultrasound-assisted conventional hydrothermal pro-
cess. The authors show that the application of ultrasound energy for
40 min prior to hydrothermal incubation enhances zeolite crystalli-
zation and reduces the time required for new phase formation from
2 h to 1 h. Recently, Bukhari et al. [456] documented the use of soni-
cation for the zeolitization of chemical extracts from coal fly ash and
explored the mechanisms pertaining to direct ultrasound irradiation
of the reacting mixture. The results show Na-A zeolite formation
after 1 h of treatment at 85 °C and indicate that zeolite A is trans-
formed to the more stable hydroxysodalite under prolonged sonica-
tion at 95 °C. Ojumu et al. [461] instead investigated the possibility
of replacing the fusion step with a high-intensity ultrasonic treat-
ment during zeolite synthesis, showing that zeolite A formation is
optimized by sonication for 10 min followed by hydrothermal treat-
ment for 2 h at 90 °C (without pre-fusion); they also demonstrate
that 10 min of high-intensity ultrasound irradiation can successfully
replace the conventional 90 min energy-intensive fusion step. More-
over, a total of 24% of the Si was extracted from coal fly ash during
sonication, compared to the 32% obtained through the fusion pro-
cess; they also found that ultrasonic treatment dissolved only the
cola fly ash amorphous phase.

PKey factors and issues: a brief summary
PAccording to the literature, the sonication process provides numer-
ous advantages for the conversion of fly ash to zeolite; among these,
the lower temperature and shorter required synthesis time are the
most significant. Moreover, there is evidence that the degree of zeolite
crystallinity increases through ultrasonic irradiation. The key factors
in this approach is the ability of ultrasonic processing to accelerate
the dissolution of amorphous fly ash material, which leads to Al-Si
supersaturation and produces a high crystalline phase nucleation rate.

PThis process is related to ultrasonic cavitation, which can be defined
as the growth and explosive collapse of microscopic bubbles. Cavita-
tion also increases secondary nucleation rates and mass transfer, with
a subsequent increase in crystal growth rates. Moreover, the reduction
in the zeolite crystallization temperature minimizes the effects of var-
iable fly ash composition (which is primarily related to differences in
Si/Al ratios). As discussed for the microwave heating process, the
absence of pilot-scale experiments and industrial tests constitutes the
most important limitation of the sonication approach. Fig. 17 shows a
flowchart of the sonication method.

3.2. End uses of synthetic zeolites

PThe applications of zeolites synthesised from coal fly ash are
diverse and well known. Numerous publications have documented a
wide range of uses for these minerals in different contexts ranging
from environmental mitigation to catalysis to cement production.
The wide use of fly ash may also be explained by the fact that the
conversion of coal fly ash to zeolite reduces the potential toxicity of
the raw material; the mobility of elements such as Cd, Pb, Ni, and Cr
is lower in synthetic products because these elements are encapsu-
lated in the newly formed mineral structure [436]. To the best of our
knowledge, very few data have been published on the utilization of
zeolite synthesised from biomass ash. The following brief overview is
focused largely on the successful utilization of synthetic coal fly ash
products in environmental pollution, catalytic processes, and select
emerging innovative applications. This section aims to document
that it is possible to transform waste materials in useful products.

P3.2.1. Environmental pollution

PZeolites synthesised from coal fly ash have been used for mine
water remediation and the treatment of acid mine drainage
[426,462,463] as well as the removal of ammonium from contami-
nated solutions [464(cid:1)467] and heavy metals from polluted water
[385,432,468(cid:1)472]. Prasad and Mortimer [478] demonstrated that
zeolite formed from fly ash is effective in removing all metals from
mine water and that increased doses result in enhanced removal.
Chalupnik et al.et al. [473] presented laboratory results on the purifi-
cation of mine waters by synthetic zeolite application, which consti-
tutes an inexpensive passive method to remove radium isotopes and
other stable pollutants such as barium, iron, and manganese. Somer-
set et al. [428] focused on Pb and Hg, showing that synthetic zeolite
application can reduce the lead and mercury concentrations in mine
wastewater by 95% and 30%, respectively. Zhang et al. [464] exam-
ined the ability of zeolite synthesised from coal fly ash to remove
ammonium from aqueous solutions, concluding that synthetic fauja-
site is highly efficient as an ion exchanger, as indicated by the kinetic
Ho'pseudo-second-order model. Moreover, thermodynamic stud-
ies reveal that the uptake of ammonium by synthetic zeolite is
exothermic in nature. The simultaneous removal of ammonium
and phosphate by fly ash synthetic products was explored by
Wu et al. [474], who show that pre-saturation of synthetic zeo-
lite with an appropriate cation, such as Al3+, Ca2+, or Fe3+,
improves its efficiency in polluted water remediation. Zhang
et al. [465] demonstrate that both ammonium and phosphate
removal efficiencies are greatly enhanced by the use of synthetic
zeolite treated with H2SO4.

PSinger and Berkagu [421] and Lin and His [392] first scrutinized
metal adsorption by zeolite formed from coal fly ash. Woolard et al.
[261] reported the use of modified fly ash as an adsorbent for lead in
polluted aqueous solutions. The authors examined the efficiency of
zeolite formed form fly ash as adsorbent for lead in polluted water,
demonstrating that Na-P1 zeolite is more effective than hydroxyso-
dalite. Scott et al. [471], who suggested that zeolitic type and mor-
phology influences the rate of lead ion removal, confirmed these
results. Lee et al. [475] investigated the adsorption performance and
selectivity of lead metals by zeolite synthesised from fly ash as a
function of the initial metal concentration, solution pH, adsorption
isotherm, and rate; approximately 90% of lead ions were adsorbed
within 30 min after the beginning of the experiments, and equilib-
rium was reached within 2 h. Recently, Golbad et al. [476] conducted
adsorption isotherm studies to evaluate the ability of hydroxysoda-
lite formed from fly ash to adsorb lead ions in aqueous media, find-
ing that the adsorption capacity increases with increased contact
time; a 98.1% removal efficiency was observed for a solid-to-liquid
ratio of 3.0 g/dm3 and an initial lead concentration of 100 mg/dm3.
The adsorption capacity of synthetic zeolite for trivalent chromium
has also been analysed [477,478]. Wu et al. [479] show that the chro-
mium removal mechanism for zeolitic fly ash involves ion exchange
and precipitation as chromium hydroxide. Moreover, pH plays a key
role; at pH values above the solubility range, the toxic element
removal efficiency approaches 100% due to the precipitation of Cr
(OH)3 on the adsorbent surfaces. Finally, the kinetic behaviour for
the adsorption of indigo carmine dye on zeolite formed from coal fly
ash has also been recently investigated [480].

PSeveral remediation technologies have been developed in order
to mitigate polluted soils; among these, several studies have
described positive results obtained by adding zeolite synthesised
from fly ash to polluted soil [481(cid:1)483]. Lin et al. [481] performed
column experiments, adding from 0.5 g to 16 g of zeolite synthesised
from coal fly ash to 100 g Cd-contaminated soil samples; the results
indicate that the addition of synthetic product strongly inhibits the
leaching of toxic elements, demonstrating the ability of zeolite to
stabilize Cd contents in polluted soil. The immobilization of heavy
metals in polluted soil by the addition of zeolite formed from fly ash
has also been shown by Moreno et al. [482]. Querol et al. [483] used
Na-P1 zeolite synthesised from Spanish coal fly ash to amend pol-
luted soil. The experimental results indicate that the increase in soil
pH due to the addition of synthetic zeolite is responsible for the
immobilization of the metal since it drives the precipitation of metal
hydroxides. Moreover, zeolitic material is characterized by a high
exchange capacity that contributes to reduce soluble metal concen-
trations. The efficiency of zeolite formed from fly ash in polluted soil
remediation has also been documented in soils characterized by
high concentrations of toxic elements [386,484(cid:1)486]; these papers
constitute good examples of solidification and stabilization technol-
ogy using synthetic products.

PSynthetic zeolites have also found applications in the adsorption
of gases such as CO2, SO2, and mercury from exhaust gases. Querol
et al. [487] analysed the CO2 and SO2 adsorption capacity of zeolite
synthesised from silica extracts from fly ash and determined sorp-
tion values up to 74 mg/g and 297 mg/g, respectively. Moreover, the
authors state that the major potential applications of this synthetic
product for gas treatment lie in water vapour uptake and/or SO2
sorption from limited-water gaseous effluents. Wdowin et al. [488]
tested Na-X and Na-P zeolite formed from coal fly ash for mercury
uptake from a gaseous stream; to improve Hg adsorption efficiency,
the synthetic products were thermally activated and treated with
silver. The data show that treatment with Ag drastically improves
the performance of zeolite thanks to the exceptional BET surface
area and combined micro- and meso-pore volumes. In a subsequent
manuscript [489], the authors show that the removal of mercury
from exhaust gas depends on several important factors such as

Psorbent texture (powder or granulated), exhaust gas flow rate, and
contact time, as well as the temperature of the experiment. This new
paper confirms that Ag-impregnated synthetic Na-X zeolite reduces
the level of mercury in the flue gas; the experiments showed long-
term mercury breakthrough ranging from 15% to 40% (these mercury
capture results were obtained for granulated material).

PThe use of synthetic zeolite has been also tested for the adsorp-
tion of benzene, toluene, and isomers of xylene (BTX) from gas
streams [490] and aqueous solutions [491], as well as land-based
petroleum spill clean-up [492,493]. Bandura et al. [490] demonstrate
high BTX sorption capacity in gas streams for Na-X zeolite formed
from coal fly ash, and explain that this behaviour is caused by the
pore structure of the faujasite zeolite group, which is characterized
by channels with large dimensions. Bandura and co-workers [493]
studied instead the efficiency of zeolite formed from coal fly ash for
BTX removal from aqueous solutions. The authors showed that syn-
thetic NaP1 sorption removes 99%, 77%, and 35% of xylenes, toluene,
and benzene, respectively, at equilibrium. This removal order
(xylenes > toluene > benzene) corresponds to decreasing hydropho-
bicity and molecular weight and increasing water solubility. More-
over, the data indicate that the zeolite removal efficiency decreases
with an increase in initial BTX concentration due to the saturation of
adsorption sites at higher elemental concentrations. Similar experi-
ments have been performed using synthetic zeolite modified with
surfactants [494]. Finally, the high sorption capacity of NaP1 and
NaX zeolites for two diesel fuels and one engine oil was investigated
by Bandura et al. [492]. The results show that the zeolite mesoporous
filling plays a dominant role in the sorption process and that the par-
ticle size distribution and sorbent texture are decisive factors in
petroleum product immobilization.

P3.2.2. Catalysis

PAccording to the literature, a few efforts focusing on fly ash-
derived zeolite in catalyst applications have been published. Among
these, Rios et al. [495] investigated the synthesis of NaY zeolite from
Colombian coal fly ash and suggested modifying the synthesised
zeolite through Na ion exchange with ammonium and hydrogen
ions. This process improves the catalytic efficiency of synthesised
zeolite in petroleum refinery catalytic cracking units, which convert
high-boiling fractions of petroleum crude to gasoline, diesel, and
other products, as suggested by Htay and Oo [496]. The research and
hypothesis of Rios et al. [495] are in agreement with Yamamoto
et al. [497], who, in a review on zeolite catalysis, described zeolite
ion exchange as one of the most useful methods for the preparation
of heterogeneous catalysts, as zeolites can easily exchange structural
cations with dissolved cations. The authors emphasise that transi-
tion metals (and their ionic forms) stabilized in zeolite crystalline
lattices have been used for catalysing a wide range of organic reac-
tions. Investigation of the utilization of fly ash-derived zeolite as a
catalyst for polypropylene pyrolysis was performed by Nam et al.
[498] and Kim et al. [499]. Vichaphund et al. [420] used fly ash col-
lected from pulp and paper industries in Thailand as raw material
for synthesizing ZSM-5 and investigated the derived zeolites for cat-
alytic fast pyrolysis applications. Zeolite ZSM-5 has also been pro-
duced from biomass such as rice hull ash; due to its high selectivity
in catalytic reactions and high thermal and acidic stability, several
potential industrial applications have been analysed [500].

P3.2.3. Emerging applications and nanozeolite

PIn the past few years, great attention has been paid to the use of
fly ash to form zeolite with particular properties (such as magnetic
properties) and/or nanoparticle sizes [435,436,501,502] for use in
innovative applications [503]. Yamaura and Fungaro [504] formed
zeolite with singular magnetic properties by combining magnetite
with zeolite synthesised from the coal ash.

PThis new synthetic product has been successfully used as adsor-
bent in water pollution applications and is quite practical for such
uses, as it is easily attracted to and separated from aqueous solutions
using a magnet. Chen et al. [505] synthesised pure Na-P and Na-X
zeolite by adding organic compounds such as monoethanolamine,
triethanolamine, and diethanolamine during hydrothermal process-
ing of treated coal fly ash, showing that the addition of organic addi-
improving the
tives generates smaller zeolite particle sizes,
performance of the synthetic product in catalytic reactions and
adsorption. With the aim of developing an effective, innovative
method to inexpensively synthesize catalysts, Durairaj and Vaithilin-
gam [503] produced a metal-loaded catalyst from fly ash-based zeo-
lite with respectable catalytic activity.

4. Conclusions

PThis article aims to give an overview of the numerous peer-
review studies on coal and biomass fly ash that have been published
since 1990. Coal ash is the major solid residue produced by coal com-
bustion in thermo-electric power plants, while biomass ash is the
combustion residue of biomass, one of the most innovative sources
of renewable energy. The constantly increasing production of com-
bustion wastes over the past few years has motivated researchers to
find new waste applications and innovative methods for the conver-
sion of waste into useful products. Coal fly ash utilization has been
investigated in many contexts since the first publication in 1985,
and the abundant research on fly ash conversion into zeolitic prod-
ucts has featured prominently. The synthesis of zeolite from coal fly
is generally performed in closed, alkaline reaction system through
one of five main processes: the conventional hydrothermal process,
the alkaline fusion-assisted hydrothermal process, multi-step treat-
ment, microwave heating, or ultrasonic processing. Each approach
can be characterized by its major advantages and disadvantages.
However, although the conversion of fly ash to zeolite constitutes a
quite well-documented approach to sensibly reducing the amount
of combustion residues deposited in landfills, more research is
needed, primarily regarding the synthesis of nanoparticle zeolites
and their potential utilization in medical applications.

POn the contrary, the literature indicate that, despite the docu-
mentation of biomass ash application in soil amendment, environ-
mental remediation, construction, ceramics, catalysts, and catalytic
supports, very little has been published on the use of biomass ash as
a raw materials in zeolite synthesis; those papers that have been
published on the topic concern only the use of rice husk ash. The
chemical and mineralogical compositions of most biomass ash
makes it a desirable raw material for zeolite synthesis; thus, innova-
tive research in this still relatively unexplored field is strongly rec-
ommended.
