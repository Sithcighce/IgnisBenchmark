End-gas autoignition, especially with detonation development in a confined space, is a complex physical phe-
nomenon, including premixed flame dynamics, fluid dynamics, autoignition chemistry etc., which is generally
considered as the origin of knock and super-knock in internal combustion (IC) engines. Furthermore, the
mechanism for detonation initiation is also related to fire safety and industrial disasters. Thus, this review focuses
on the recent progress made in the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of end-gas autoignition
phenomena along with detonation combustion in confined spaces through theoretical analyses, optical di-
agnostics, and high-resolution numerical simulations, with emphasis on the effects of crucial physicochemical
factors on the two stages of end-gas autoignition, namely autoignition occurrence and autoignition propagation.
Firstly, two basic theories, namely Livengood–Wu (L–W) integral and the reactivity gradient theory, which
provide theoretical foundations for understanding autoignition occurrence and autoignition propagation,
respectively, are demonstrated. Specially, applications and limitations of L-W integral and the extension of
Bradley’s diagram to multi-dimensional conditions closer to actual circumstances are elaborated. Then, a
comprehensive investigation of several pivotal physicochemical factors involved in end-gas autoignition and
detonation development in confined spaces, are conducted, including flame propagation, pressure wave, in-
homogeneity, turbulence, chemical reactivity and thermodynamic conditions. The results indicate that, three
essential elements are included in end-gas autoignition, namely flame, pressure wave, and autoignition. The
flame-pressure interaction induced end-gas autoignition and detonation can be divided into three processes: I-
reactivity increase, II-critical and sensitive state, and III-coupling and detonation. The first two processes account
for autoignition occurrence and the third accounts for autoignition propagation. As to autoignition occurrence,
increasing turbulence flame speed can inhibit end-gas autoignition under weak pressure wave conditions,
whereas it can promote end-gas autoignition under strong pressure wave conditions. As to autoignition propa-
gation, various combustion modes can originate from a reactivity gradient induced by temperature, composition,
additive, as well as a cold spot within negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region, while the existence of low-
temperature chemistry (LTC) and multi-stage ignition complicates autoignition propagation. The results further
indicate that an inhomogeneous field with a small characteristic length scale, and an inhomogeneous field with a
large characteristic length scale but coupled with the turbulence with a small characteristic length scale and a
sufficiently large turbulent velocity fluctuation, can both weaken detonation propensity. Furthermore, the fuel
type, diluent gas, and thermodynamic conditions can affect both autoignition occurrence and autoignition
propagation. However, the effects of fuel type and energy density on autoignition propagation may not be
completely explained by Bradley’s diagram, and should be considered separately. Lastly, the review discusses the
stochasticity of end-gas autoignition and the similarity and difference of detonation in IC engines from defla-
gration to detonation transition (DDT) in ducts, and provides inspirations obtained from the present fundamental
studies for the engineering applications and future prospects.

1. Introduction

IC engines have advantages of high thermal efficiency, simple
structure, and high power density, and thus are popularly applied in
transportation, engineering and agricultural machinery, and electric
power generation. According to the Key World Energy Statistics of In-
ternational Energy Agency (IEA), the transportation industry consumes
the most oil resources, accounting for roughly 60 % of the total oil
consumption. To address the increasingly serious energy and environ-
mental issues, a range of mandatory national standards have been
formulated globally in terms of vehicle fuel consumption and CO2
emission. The European Union limited the CO2 emission to 95 g/km in
2021 for passenger vehicles, which is the lowest target worldwide, and
they further aim to reduce this value by 15 % before 2025. The United
States is the first country to set a long-term target (2025 target) in the
world. In 2025, 99 g/km is expected to be reached in the United States.
China has also set the goal of achieving carbon limit to 120 g/km for
passenger cars, and it is expected to decline to 95 g/km by 2025. Ac-
cording to International Council of Clean Transportation, approximately
80 % of the current light vehicles sold in the world cannot meet the latest
fuel consumption and CO2 emission limits. Thus, the automobile in-
dustry is facing an unprecedented challenge.

Recently, a significant number of countries worldwide have been
strongly promoting the development of electric and fuel cell vehicles.

But, owing to poor energy density, short mileage, and inconvenient
charging of the battery, it is unrealistic to replace IC engines with bat-
teries in a short time. Considering the predictions issued by the IEA, 58
% of the passenger cars will continue to run by IC engines by 2050. IC
engines will be the leading power source of the world’s transportation
industry in the perceivable future. To satisfy the increasingly stringent
fuel consumption regulations, more efficient technologies are being
developed to enhance the thermal efficiency of IC engines.

worldwide, and more than half of vehicles are powered by spark ignition
(SI) gasoline engines. Turbocharged and downsized engines with direct
gasoline injection have a crucial influence on resolving transportation-
related problems, such as air pollution, climate change, and energy
insecurity. By increasing the compression ratio, the thermal efficiency
can be significantly increased, while decreasing the fuel consumption
significantly. However, with the increase in the heat load in a downsized
engine, abnormal combustion phenomena, e.g., conventional knock and
super-knock (or low-speed pre-ignition) [1], are more likely to occur.
Knock is so called because of its objectional noise outside the engine.
Knocking combustion can result in pressure oscillations with an ampli-
to lead to engine
tude exceeding 0.5 MPa, which has potential

performance decline and irreversible damage to engine components. In
particular, super-knock, occurring under the low-speed and high-load
operating conditions, can cause an extremely high peak pressure of
more than 30 MPa. The knock and super-knock are the bottleneck fac-
tors that restrict further improvement of thermal efficiency in downsized
SI engines.

End-gas autoignition mechanism, as schematically shown in Fig. 1(a)
and (b), is a widely accepted theory to explain the occurrence of knock.
It assumes that prior to the SI flame igniting the mixture in the end-gas
region, the end-gas autoignition leads to engine knock [1,2]. Fig. 1(c)
shows the possible pathway of end-gas autoignition resulting in
knocking combustion. After the SI, the pressure and temperature in
end-gas region continually increase owing to the compression by flame
propagation. Autoignition takes place sequentially within the hotspots
in the end-gas region as their ignition delay times elapse respectively.
Pressure waves are generated from the fast autoignition reaction front
propagation and their reflections on the cylinder wall cause pressure
oscillations (as shown in Fig. 1(b)). Knock intensity, usually measured
by Maximum Amplitude of Pressure Oscillation (MAPO), is mainly
determined by the propagation mode of the autoignition reaction front
[3]. Specifically, the light and moderate knock correspond to the sce-
nario, in which there was no coupling between the pressure wave and
the reaction front for all autoignition spots, i.e., the autoignition front
propagates as deflagration or thermal explosion. Super-knock is attrib-
uted to detonation development as long as the coupling is satisfied in
any one autoignition spot [4,5]. Stable detonation is characterized by a
coupling between a shock wave and a finite length reaction zone behind
it; the precursor shock wave compresses the unburned gas and rapidly
increases its temperature, and after a period of ignition delay, the

unburned mixture is spontaneously ignited. The chemical reaction
rapidly and extensively releases heat, which in turn, maintains the
precursor shock wave, and the coupling of the shock wave and chemical
reaction zone makes detonation a self-sustaining process and propagate
at a specific supersonic speed, called Chapman–Jouguet (CJ) speed [6,
7]. It should be noted that super-knock always follows pre-ignition, a
type of ignition event primarily initiated by the oil-fuel droplet, hot
surface or detached deposit, prior to the spark ignition. Therefore, the
flames induced by pre-ignition and SI could propagate together in
super-knock circumstances, enhancing the compressing effect on end
gas.

1.2. Motivation: from engineering technologies to fundamental
physicochemical factors

Considering the adverse effects of knocking combustion, many ef-
forts have been devoted by researchers and manufactures to seek
effective controlling strategies for mitigating knocking combustion in
the last decades. Retarding spark timing is a straightforward way to
suppress light and moderate knock without the modification of engine
structures, and has been extensively applied in production engines,
although it can lead to performance decline. However, retarding spark
timing is useless to super-knock, since the initial flame in super-knock is
ignited by pre-ignition rather than spark plug. Exhaust gas recirculation
(EGR), especially cooled EGR where the exhaust gas is cooled by a cooler
in an external loop and then enters intake manifold, is an effective way
to prevent both knock and super-knock. Other suppression methods for
knocking combustion also include variation compression ratio, Miller
cycle, split injection, dual-fuel injection, multi-point ignition, etc. In

addition, since super-knock is caused by pre-ignition, the measures that
can mitigate pre-ignition equally contribute to super-knock inhibition, e.
g., avoiding the intrusion of lubricant oil into the combustion chamber.
There have been a few excellent reviews [2,11,12] focusing on these
engineering technologies for pre-ignition and knock suppression.

From the perspective of combustion phenomenon itself, end-gas
autoignition should be fundamentally controlled by several crucial
physicochemical factors, including the thermodynamic conditions of the
fuel/air mixture, fuel reactivity and its inhomogeneity, pressure waves,
flame propagation velocity and turbulence in the cylinder, etc. The ap-
plications of the aforementioned engineering technologies for knock
suppression are essentially attributed to their influences on the corre-
sponding physicochemical factors controlling end-gas autoignition.
Fig. 2 summarizes the crucial physicochemical factors controlling end-
gas autoignition and their corresponding engineering technologies for
knock suppression. Note that the factor “pressure wave” is not included
considering pressure wave is a factor generated in the process and
cannot be directly controlled. As can be seen, for a single physico-
chemical factor, there could exist multiple technologies able to adjust it.
For example, both retarding spark timing and cooled EGR can change
the thermodynamic conditions of the mixture. Therefore, fundamental
investigations on the effects of a specific physicochemical factor on end-
gas autoignition can simultaneously provide guidance and inspiration
for the implementation of multiple engineering technologies related to
it. However, it is difficult to capture detailed combustion information

the thermodynamic conditions and chemical reactivity of mixture
simultaneously. Considering the above deficiencies, many efforts have
been made to focus on the fundamental study of the effects of the crucial
physicochemical factors on end-gas autoignition, and great progress has
been made in recent years thanks to the development of high-resolution
optical diagnostics and high-accuracy numerical methods as well as
computational resources, which motivates us to finish this review.
Therefore, the present review is distinct from the existing articles [2,11,
12] which primarily focus on the engineering technologies for knock
suppression and the cause of pre-ignition. Additionally, as a review of
fundamental research, we believe it not only provides a comprehensive
understanding of knocking combustion, but also has the universality to
serve in other areas, such as fire safety and propulsion. Furthermore, the
present article covers hydrogen combustion, due to the increasing in-
terest in hydrogen utilization in engines.

1.3. Scope and organization of the present review

1.3.1. Scope

As mentioned above, the present review intends to provide a detailed
understanding in the fundamental research focusing on the effects of the
crucial physicochemical factors on end-gas autoignition and detonation
development with knocking combustion in engines as the background.
The basic theories and physicochemical factors emphasized in the pre-
sent work and the major research methods used in these reviewed
studies are summarized in Fig. 3.

1.3.1.1. Basic theories. End-gas autoignition phenomenon can be
divided into two stages: autoignition occurrence and autoignition
propagation, both of which determine the knock intensity. L-W integral
[14] and reactivity gradient theory [21,22] provide theoretical bases for
the two stages, respectively. Ignition delay time (IDT) measures the time
needed by the mixture staying at a stable thermodynamic condition, i.e.,
unchanged temperature and pressure, to autoignite, so it cannot directly
be used to represent the autoignition timing needed by end gas whose
temperature and pressure are continually changed owing to the
compression by SI/pre-ignition flame and piston. L-W integral provides
a formula to evaluate end-gas autoignition timing. Although L-W inte-
gral is based on simplified chemical kinetics and has limitations, it
provides a simple and effective method to predict end-gas autoignition
occurrence, especially for experimental studies and engineering appli-
cation. Moreover, some theoretical derivations based on L-W integral
can also help us understand the relationship between flame speed and
end-gas autoignition. Therefore, L-W integral is included as one of the
basic theories in this review. Another important theory is reactivity
gradient theory which pointed out the possible propagation modes of
autoignition front. The evolution of the theory, especially its extension

to multi-dimensional conditions closer to practical applications than 1D
linear gradient, are discussed in the review.

is

1.3.1.2. Crucial physicochemical factors. Following the two theories, the
review further focuses on the fundamental physicochemical factors
affecting end-gas autoignition and detonation development in confined
spaces. The first and most important is pressure wave. The pressure
oscillation induced by knock is due to the pressure wave propagation
back and forth in the cylinder, while super knock is related to detonation
wave development in confined spaces owing to the coupling between
the reaction front and pressure wave (shock wave). Therefore, the
observation and investigation of
the waves as well as flame/
autoignition-wave interactions are crucial to revealing the underlying
mechanism of knocking combustion. The second factor
in-
homogeneity which directly decides autoignition propagation modes.
Various combustion modes of end-gas autoignition caused by 1D linear
gradient and multi-dimensional inhomogeneities are deeply discussed in
the present review. Particularly, the effects of LTC, NTC effects, multi-
stage ignition on the evolution of autoignition front are elaborated.
The third factor is turbulence. Turbulence affects end-gas autoignition
mainly by interacting with flame propagation and inhomogeneity. The
review puts an emphasis on the investigations of the relationship be-
tween turbulent flame speed and end-gas autoignition occurrence and
autoignition propagation modes induced by the interactions between
well-defined turbulent and inhomogeneous fields. The fourth is chemi-
cal reactivity, which plays a vital role in autoignition characteristics and
the detonability of end gas, and thus can affect both autoignition
occurrence and autoignition propagation. Two factors affecting chemi-
cal reactivity, i.e., fuel type and diluent gas are focused in the present
review. The last factor is thermodynamic conditions. The effects of en-
ergy density, a main representation of thermodynamic conditions, on
knocking combustion have been discussed in the previous review [2];
therefore, the present review mainly highlights the progress in this topic
since then. The reviewed articles related to the above physicochemical
factors and particularly published in the journals of Combustion and
Flame and Proceedings of the Combustion Institute over the past seven
years (2017–2024), are listed in Table 1.

1.3.1.3. Research methods. Most of the studies in the present review
were conducted in the experimental facilities and numerical models
which are largely simplified from the practical engine combustion
chambers to facilitate observing the detailed combustion process.
Combustion usually finished in a constant volume without the consid-
eration of piston motion in these studies.

Experimental facilities. The experimental facilities mainly include
rapid compression machines (RCMs) and constant-volume combustion
chambers (CVCCs). As a mechanical simplification of the reciprocating

engines, the single-shot, piston-based RCMs cannot only provide a ge-
ometry and a well-controlled thermodynamic condition close to prac-
tical engines for the mixture in the chamber, but also avoid the
complications arising from cycle-to-cycle variability, gas exchange, heat
transfer, etc., which is beneficial to investigating the effect of a specific
single factor on the combustion process. CVCCs are usually utilized to
investigate flame dynamics [81,82], spray characteristics [83,84] etc. As
mentioned before, flame-pressure wave interaction is crucial to end-gas
autoignition; however, it is difficult for the laminar flame to produce
strong pressure wave to investigate the flame-pressure wave interactions
in conventional CVCCs. Therefore, inspired by the basic theory of flame
acceleration and DDT across obstacles [85,86], a perforated plate was
employed in the CVCC developed in Tianjin University [87–89], (here-
inafter called CVCC-TJU), to generate a controlled flame acceleration
and pressure/shock wave formation in a confined space, as shown in
Fig. 4 [70]. The combustion chamber of CVCC-TJU is composed of a 100
mm wide and 230 mm long cylinder with two optical glass windows
mounted in the front and in the back, respectively, to provide full
visualization. The large space with optical windows as well as
high-speed schlieren photography can facilitate the clear observations of

the detailed combustion process including flame propagation, pressure
wave generation and end-gas autoignition, etc. It should be noted that
the operating conditions of CVCC lead to its quantitative combustion
difference from engine chambers, mainly in pressure wave intensity and
initial mixture temperature. In most CVCC experimental studies in the
review, the initial mixture temperature lower than that at top dead
center (TDC) in engines. However, CVCC has the qualitatively similar
combustion elements to engine chamber in terms of flame propagation,
pressure wave development and end-gas autoignition, i.e., flame prop-
agation producing pressure waves and pressure waves compressing end
gas to autoignite, which consequently can provide a qualitative under-
standing on end-gas autoignition phenomenon in engines.

Numerical simulations. The numerical simulations reviewed in the
present study primarily adopt 1D and two-dimensional (2D) simplified
model from engine chambers. The initial mixture temperature and
pressure in these reviewed studies are usually close to those at TDC in
engines. 1D studies are usually the simulation of radial combustion
process in engine combustion chambers, as shown in Fig. 1(b). 2D model
usually have two types of geometries. One is a circle as shown in Fig. 1
(a), which is the simulation of the cross-section perpendicular to the

axial direction of the engine cylinders. The other is a rectangular, which
is the simulation of the cross-section parallel to the axial direction of the
engine cylinders.

1.3.2. Organization

The organization of this paper and the relation of each section are
shown in Fig. 5. As mentioned before, end-gas autoignition phenomenon
can be divided into two stages: autoignition occurrence and autoignition
propagation. Therefore, this paper starts with two basic theories in
Section 2: L-W integral and the reactivity gradient theory, which provide
theoretical foundations for the two stages respectively. Next, Section 3
puts emphasis on the effects of crucial physicochemical factors on
autoignition occurrence, in which the relationship among turbulent
flame propagation, pressure wave, and end-gas autoignition are clari-
fied. Then, Section 4 focuses on autoignition propagation. According to
the reactivity gradient theory, reactivity inhomogeneity has the most
direct influence on autoignition propagation modes. Therefore, reac-
tivity inhomogeneity and turbulence-inhomogeneity interactions are
discussed in Section 4. It should be noted that in order to keep the
integrity of some processes, Section 3 involves some autoignition
propagation processes and Section 4 involves some autoignition occur-
rence processes, but they are really limited. The chemical reactivity it-
self and thermodynamic conditions can affect both autoignition
occurrence and autoignition propagation, and thus are difficult to be
strictly categorized in the last two sections. Their effects are discussed in
Section 5. Note that
turbulence-flame propagation interaction is
included in Section 3 and turbulence-inhomogeneity interaction is
included in Section 4, and thus turbulence is not discussed in a separated
section. Discussions, inspirations, and future prospects are provided in
Section 6. Based on the investigations in the previous sections, it dis-
cusses the characteristics of end-gas autoignition and detonation
development, including its similarities and differences with DDT in
ducts and its stochasticity, then provides the inspiration from these
reviewed fundamental studies to engineering applications as a callback
to Section 1.2, and lastly demonstrates prospects for fundamental
research and engineering technologies in this topic. Finally, conclusions
from the present review are summarized in Section 7. Overall, the re-
view takes the engineering problem, i.e., knocking combustion as the
background, investigates the fundamental combustion phenomena, i.e.,
end-gas autoignition and detonation, behind it, in terms of the related
basic theories and crucial physicochemical factors involved in these
phenomena, discusses the characteristics of these phenomena, and lastly
proposes some inspirations for solving this engineering problem. The
overall flow is shown in the right part of Fig. 5.

2. Basic theory of end-gas autoignition and detonation

As mentioned before, end-gas autoignition phenomenon can be
divided into two stages: autoignition occurrence and autoignition
propagation, both of which determine knock intensity. In this sections,
two basic theories responsible for the two stages are discussed, which
intends to provide a theoretical foundation for the investigations on the
crucial physicochemical factors in the next three sections. The first
theory is L-W integral, which is deduced based on simplified chemical
reaction kinetics and can predict the end-gas autoignition timing; its
basic concept, improvements and applications are discussed in Section
2.1. The second theory is reactivity gradient theory, which points out the
possible propagation modes of the reaction fronts after autoignition is
initiated by a hotspot; its evolution and extension to multi-dimensional
conditions are discussed in Section 2.2.

2.1. Livengood–Wu integral

Whether end-gas autoignition can occur is determined by the
competition between the time required for the primary flame to
consume all the fresh mixture and IDT of the end gas. When the former is
larger than the latter, autoignition takes place; otherwise, autoignition is
suppressed. Evaluating IDT of the end gas is different from the canonical
IDT. The canonical IDT is built on the process where the temperature
and the pressure of mixture maintain at constant values before auto-
ignition, and it can be obtained from RCM and shock tube experiments
[90–92] and empirical
as well as detailed chemical kinetics
Arrhenius-like correlations [93,94]. However, predicting ignition delay
time of the end gas is a difficult task, since the temperature and the
pressure of end-gas continually change owing to the piston motion and
flame propagation, which requires their real-time effects to be involved
in the evaluation. Similar situation also exists for autoignition in
compression ignition (CI) engines. The basic idea to solve this problem
was first proposed by Livengood and Wu [14], thus named as L-W in-
tegral, and has since been improved by subsequent works [29,95–97],
although it is subject to some strong assumptions. To avoid ambiguity,
the IDT of the mixture with changing temperature and pressure are
called IDT-LW, whereas the IDT in particular refers to the canonical IDT
hereinafter.

2.1.1. Basic concept

The basic idea of L-W integral is evaluating IDT-LW based on IDT. It
adopted two assumptions. The first one is that a chemical reaction can be
represented by a global form with the reaction rate denoted as

d(x)
dt

= f(p, T, Y, t, etc.)

(1)

where (x) is the concentration of crucial reaction products, t is the time,
p, T and, Y are the pressure, temperature, and chemical composition,
respectively, and f is an empirical function. Considering the autoignition
in RCM process (RCM process means that the temperature and the
pressure of the mixture is rapidly raised by the piston compression and
then maintain at a desired level before autoignition), the autoignition
onset is assumed to be a sudden transition to a process, wherein the
combustion reaction is completed within a time interval smaller by or-
ders of magnitude than IDT. Therefore, a critical value for the concen-
tration, (x)
c, which represents the limit for the accumulation process of
chain carriers, can be defined at the instant of the transition. That is to
say, autoignition takes place once (x) reaches (x)
c is a constant
which is only determined by mixture composition but not related to
mixture temperature and pressure. The second and the most crucial
assumption is shown in Fig. 6. It is assumed that there is a uniform
functional relationship between the relative concentration (x)/(x)
c and
the relative time t/τRCM, for the preliminary reactions in RCM auto-
ignition process when the fuel-air mixture is fixed, regardless of post-

compression temperature and pressure. Here, τRCM is IDT corresponding
to post-compression temperature and pressure. To meet this assumption,
it further assumed that the reaction is zeroth-order. According to these
assumptions, the following derivation is obtained.

Considering three different RCM processes, denoted by A, B, and C,
as shown in Fig. 7(a), their IDTs are taken to be τA, τB, τC, respectively.
Then if the mixture is compressed along the stepped path, O-A-A′-B′-C′
shown in Fig. 7 (b), autoignition will take place when

with τ denoting IDT corresponding to instantaneous temperature and

occurrence of end gas when the state–time history of the end-gas
mixture is known.

In the realistic oxidation process, all the fuels consist of a series of
elementary reactions that could branch and terminate, wherein each
reaction could promote or retard the reaction rate of other elementary
reactions that have the same radicals. The reaction orders of these
elementary reactions and consequently of the global reaction could be
not zeroth-order. However, The L–W integral, with a single step
Arrhenius-like kinetics describing IDT, has demonstrated its simplicity

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101217

and accuracy at a certain degree in predicting the autoignition occur-
rence in both SI and CI engines [98–100]. The deduction conducted by
Pan et al. [97] indicated that for a global, nth order reaction, the result
degenerates to the L-W integral by interpreting it on an averaged basis.
Miyoshi et al. [101] showed that despite the huge combustion kinetic
mechanisms of large hydrocarbons found in practical fuels, in the early
stages chain reactions of alkane autoignition exhibit simple kinetics and
thus the linear approximation holds for the system of partial differential
equations (ODEs). These studies might explain the success of the L-W
integral when used in the realistic fuels although it assumes a
zeroth-order reaction.

2.1.2.

Improvement of Livengood–Wu integral

The accuracy of L-W integral significantly reduces when it is used to
predict fuels having two-stage ignition behavior and NTC characteristics
[102]. The NTC phenomenon is described in Fig. 8. In the NTC region,
temperature rise prolongs the IDT, and two stages are involved in the
ignition process: the first stage dominated by LTC, involving large
oxygenated species, and the second stage controlled by the consumption
of small species [50,103]. The failure of the original L–W integral in
predicting the fuel autoignition with two stage ignition arises from two
reasons; one is that the temperature rise induced by the heat release in
the first stage ignition is not considered by the integral; and the second
reason is that there exists a reaction pathway transition between the first
and second stage ignitions so that it cannot be described by one global
reaction, which violates the assumption of the original L–W integral [95,
102,104].

Several noteworthy methods [95,97,102,104] have been proposed to
solve the lack of harmony between the L–W integral and two-stage
ignition problem. A basic methodology to solve the two-stage problem
involves dividing the overall combustion process into two individual
processes, with each using the L–W integral individually. As shown in
Fig. 8, two IDTs, τ1 and τ2 corresponding to the first and second stages
ignition, can be obtained within the NTC region, and the total IDT is the
sum of τ1 and τ2. Below or beyond the NTC region, ignition happens in a
single stage. In the low-temperature region, the IDT merges with τ1,
while in the high-temperature region, another high-temperature IDT, τh
can be obtained. All the IDTs shown in Fig. 8, including τ1, τ2 and τh can
be constructed by solving detailed chemistry. For a two-stage ignition
process under varied temperatures and pressures, the IDT-LW can be
predicted by the staged L–W integral. Specifically, the first stage ignition
is predicted as

1 =

∫t1

t0

1
τ1

dt,

(7)

where t0 and t1 represent the initial time and IDT-LW of the first stage
ignition, respectively. Different studies suggest different formulae for
the prediction of the second stage ignition [97,102,104]. Here the
method of Pan et al. [97] is taken as an example. Their prediction is
given by

1 =

∫t2

t1

1
τʹ dt,

(8)

where t1 corresponds to the time predicted by Eq. (7); t2 is IDT-LW of the
second stage ignition; and τʹ
corresponds to either the second stage IDT
τ2 or high-temperature IDT, τh shown in Fig. 8, depending on instanta-
neous mixture temperature and pressure. Under certain operation con-
ditions, although the fuel has two-stage ignition characteristic and the
trajectory of its thermodynamic conditions sweeps over the NTC region,
there is no cool-flame-related phenomena in the combustion process if
the temperature and pressure change rapidly. In this situation, the
original L–W integral itself is adequate and the staged integral is not
needed; however, the IDT used in the integral needs to be corrected to

annul the effect of cool flames [95].

Furthermore, in the original L–W integral, it was assumed that the
critical concentration of chain carriers, (x)
c, would be constant for a
given air–fuel mixture regardless of the initial temperature and pressure.
Desantes et al. [105,106] pointed out that this assumption was not
realistic, and instead proposed a new method, called RCCC method, to
improve the predictions of the original L–W integral by considering the
evolution of the critical concentration of the chain carriers with tem-
perature and pressure. The new integral was written as

1 = 1
[I]

crit,τLW

∫τLW

0

[I]

(9)

where [I]

2.1.3. Application and limitation of Livengood–Wu integral

The L–W integral has widely served as a reliable approach to predict
and understand the ignition phasing in advanced CI engines, such as
gasoline direct-injection compression ignition (GDCI) engines, homo-
geneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), and reactivity-controlled
compression ignition (RCCI), under more complicated thermodynamic
histories [109–111]. As to the present review, the most important
application of the L-W integral is predicting end-gas autoignition and
help understand knocking combustion in SI engines [4,112–114]. The
combination of the L–W integral and flame propagation speed can yield
a theoretical model for understanding the competition between the
flame propagation and end-gas autoignition, that is, whether end-gas
autoignition can take place before the mixture is completely
consumed by the main flame, which will be discussed in detail in Section
3.2.2. Another important application of the L-W integral is to reduce the
computational expense of numerical simulation. Solving the detailed
chemistry is time-expensive when using computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) studies, especially in multiple dimensions. Some efforts have been
made to apply the L–W integral to save the computational cost [104,
115–117]. Yue et al. [118,119] incorporated a transported L–W integral
into the G-equation model to identify end-gas autoignition and knock
tendency in the simulations of a direct-injection SI engine. It was found
that the time cost of the new method was only one-tenth of that incurred
while solving the detailed chemistry. By solving the 1D unsteady heat
conduction equation and combining its results with the L–W integral,
Chen et al. [17] identified the critical
ignition temperature for
non-homogeneous forced ignition; they showed that compared to that
with detailed chemistry and transport, the reduction of two to three
orders in computational cost was reached. Compared to solving detailed
chemistry in CFD, the high-efficiency of the L-W integral arises from its
acquisition of the IDTs which can be either extracted from a database
tabulated a priori based on detailed chemical mechanisms or obtained
from a phenomenological model based on the Arrhenius expression.
Many experimental investigations performed on shock tubes and RCMs
have revealed that IDT τ was sensitive to the temperature and pressure,
and can be expressed as [93,94]

τ(p, T) = Ap(t)(cid:0) ne

where A is the pre-exponential parameter; n is the power dependence
coefficient of pressure; R is the gas constant, and Ea is the activation
energy. Some IDT correlations also considered its dependence on EGR
rates [120], different equivalence ratios [121,122], and different fuel

anti-knock properties [123–126].

It should be noted that the accuracy of L-W integral, especially when
used in the experimental study of engine combustion, is highly sensitive
to the uncertainty of the input parameters, which leads to the limitations
of the L-W integral [112]. According to Eq. (6), the input parameters of
the L-W integral involve IDT and the mixture condition determining the
IDT, including the instantaneous temperature, pressure and composi-
tion. The accurate acquisition of these input parameters directly decides
the prediction capability of the L-W integral for autoignition occurrence.
However, uncertainty usually exist when obtaining these parameters.
Firstly, as mentioned above, IDT is evaluated from detailed chemical
kinetics or empirical expressions, whose performance limits the ability
of L-W integral to predict autoignition. Such a limitation exists when the
L-W integral is applied to both experimental and numerical studies.
Secondly, it is difficult to accurately obtain the instantaneous mixture
temperature in the engine experiments, which is mainly attributed to
two causes. One is inhomogeneities. Owing to fuel spray, gas exchange,
wall heat transfer, etc., the distribution of the mixture temperature is not
homogeneous in the cylinder, and it is troublesome in the experiments to
find the highest temperature spot which should determine the start of
autoignition ultimately. Similarly, compositional inhomogeneities also
affect the selection of the equivalence ratio used to evaluate IDT. The
other is the estimation of mixture temperature. Even if the mixture
temperature is uniform in the cylinder, it is difficult to estimate its

accurate value. In the engine experiments, the mixture temperature is
evaluated through ideal gas equation of state or isentropic compression
correlations based on the pressure measurement, both of which need the
mixture involved in a closed system and need to know the initial mixture
temperature when it is closed; thus, uncertainty will be present when
there is any loss of mass or the initial temperature cannot be obtained
owing to the gas change between intake and exhaust. In addition, the
estimation of cylinder volume and the heat loss to walls also affect the
evaluation based on the ideal gas equation of state or isentropic
compression correlations, respectively. Therefore, mixture temperature
estimation is a major limitation for the L-W integral applying to
experiments.

Recently, Morii et al. [127] proposed a new method to predict the
end-gas autoignition occurrence. The method pointed out that for a
mixture with a Lewis number greater than unity, there existed a certain
threshold temperature above which flame structure cannot exist and
autoignition would occur for a given pressure and an equivalence ratio;
they called this theory as “explosive transition of deflagration”. The
explosive transition boundary database can be built with 1D flame cal-
culations aforehand; then end-gas autoignition onset can be predicted
when its temperature and pressure conditions crossed the explosive
transition boundary. However, such a method also needs to know the
local temperature of end gas, and thus suffers the same limitations as
L-W integral.

and detonation has been provided in the previous excellent review
[133], one can refer to it for more details. Later, Bradley and colleagues
[22,20,134] extended Zeldovich classification and identified different
combustion regimes in a peninsula diagram, called Bradley’s diagram
hereafter. Since Zeldovich theory and Bradley’s diagram have been
extensively utilized in analyzing end-gas autoignition phenomena, they
are focused in the present review. The evolution of Zeldovich theory and
Bradley’s diagram discussed in this subsection is shown in Fig. 10.

2.2.1. Zeldovich theory

Considering a 1D hotspot with non-uniform temperature distribution
as shown in Fig. 10(a) and assuming that the mixture IDT is negatively
related to temperature, the local IDT, τi, increases with distance from the
center of the hotspot, r; the autoignition will begin at the center, and
successively spread to the neighboring points whose IDT is longer, via
spontaneous ignition. Therefore, the propagation speed of the reaction
front, ua, can be denoted as

(11)

According to Zeldovich theory, different propagation modes, as
schematically shown in Fig. 11, can be identified by comparing the
propagation speed with several reference speeds [21]:

(1) ua > DCJ; here, DCJ is the CJ speed. In the circumstance, the
spontaneous wave propagates at a supersonic speed without
shock wave formation. In the limiting condition of ua→∞, a
constant volume thermal explosion is realized.

(2) ua ≤ DCJ; In the circumstance, a shock wave is generated by a
spontaneous wave, whose propagation into the unburnt mixture
can lead to a detonation ultimately.

(3) SL < ua≪a < DCJ; here, SL is the laminar flame speed and a is the
sound speed in the unburnt mixture. In the circumstance, the
spontaneous wave propagates at the rate ua. Owing to the rela-
tively slow subsonic speed, no significant shock wave is formed
and detonation is hardly initiated.

(4) ua < SL; in this case, a laminar flame propagation is obtained,
which is controlled by heat conduction and species diffusion.

Based on Zeldovich theory, some methods have been proposed to
describe autoignition/ignition regimes under CI combustion. Sankaran
et al. [135] proposed a criterion, β to identify deflagration (controlled by
thermal and species transport) and spontaneous ignition (controlled by
reactivity gradient) under RCCI conditions, defined as β = CβSL/ua
where β is a constant of order unity. β < 1 means the ignition tends to

2.2. Reactivity gradient theory

End-gas autoignition usually originates from hotspots which consist
of a ball of mixture with higher reactivity than the surrounding mixture
and able to initiate autoignition. Owing to the fuel diffusion and heat
exchange, compositional and thermal inhomogeneities exist in end gas,
which finally results in the formation of hotspots as the mixture tem-
perature and pressure is increased by the compressions of piston motion
and SI flame propagation. Although the L-W integral can predict the
autoignition onset of hotspots if the histories of hotspot temperature,
pressure and composition are known, it cannot account for how the
autoignition reaction front propagates. The reactivity gradient theory is
considered as the underlying mechanism that controls the propagation
modes induced by the inhomogeneous mixture autoignition. The reac-
tivity gradient can be present inside hotspots and is characterized by the
non-uniform distribution of temperature, concentration, or both. Early
in the last century, two ignition regimes, namely weak and strong ig-
nitions were identified in shock-induced ignition systems [128,129]. In
the strong ignition regime, an instantaneous ignition takes place within
the whole section of the tube behind the reflected shock, while the weak
ignition is characterized by distributed flame kernels with compara-
tively slow growth rate. Meyer and Oppenheim [129] showed that the
two ignition regimes are connected with the gradient of IDT with respect
to the temperature. Zeldovich quantified different propagation modes
from a hotspot by comparing the autoignition front speed to some
characteristic speeds, e.g., CJ speed [21,130]. Lee et al. [131] proposed
the shock wave amplification by coherent energy release (SWACER)
mechanism to describe how spontaneous flames can develop into
detonation, which suggested that the propagation of the spontaneous
flame was determined by the local concentration gradient;
if the
gradient can provide conditions, wherein heat release can be in phase
with the shock generated, the coupling between them can successively
and rapidly amplify the shock ultimately leading to detonation. Dold
et al. [132] provided a mathematical description of the detonation
initiation process within a non-uniform mixture based on asymptotic
analysis. Early investigations of reactivity gradient induced autoignition

spontaneous ignition whereas β > 1 means the ignition tends to defla-
gration. Further, Grogan et al. [136] proposed an ignition regime dia-
gram with turbulent Reynolds number, Ret, as abscissa, and with
turbulent Damk ̈ohler number, Dat as ordinate, to describe ignition in
RCMs with the considerations of turbulence and heat transfer, as shown
in Fig. 12. Possible ignition modes in RCMs including thermal quench-
ing, pre-ignition, strong ignition, weak/mild ignition, and mixed/DDT
were identified in the diagram. The demarcation of strong ignition and
mixed/DDT is defined by ua/a = 1, and the demarcation of mixed/DDT
and weak/mild ignition is defined by ua/SL = 1.

2.2.2. Bradley’s diagram

Based on the Zeldovich theory, Bradley et al. [22] further proposed
two dimensionless parameters to identify the propagation modes from
autoignition. The first was used to measure the extent of the coupling
between sound wave and spontaneous wave, which is given as
ξ = a
ua

(12)

.

Clearly, ξ = 1 corresponds to a perfect coupling for potential deto-
nation development based on the initial reactivity distribution, which,
however, will be changed by the thermal conduction and species
diffusion during the induction period. Therefore, detonation could
successfully develop within a range of ξ, bounded by ξl as the lower limit
and ξu as the upper limit. Bradley et al. [22] further pointed out that five
propagation modes of reaction front could exist according to the value of
ξ, which corresponded to those proposed by Zeldovich, described above:

(cid:0) 1
L , laminar flame propagation at laminar flame speed;

(1) ξ ≥ aS
(cid:0) 1
(2) ξu ≤ ξ < aS
L , subsonic autoignitive deflagration;
(3) ξl ≤ ξ < ξu, developing and developed detonation;
(4) 0 < ξ < ξl, supersonic autoignitive deflagration;
(5) ξ = 0, thermal explosion

Although ξ provides the condition for the coupling between heat
release and pressure wave, only when sufficient energy release is fed

into the pressure wave will the detonation successfully develop. This
requires that the coupling period be adequately long and/or the heat
release is adequately rapid. To this end, the second non-dimensional
parameter, ε, was introduced:
ε = r0
aτe

(13)

,

where r0 is the hotspot radius; and τe is the excitation time which is the
time from the instant of 5 % heat release rate to the maximum heat
release rate under 0D autoignition. Finally, Bradley et al. [22,134]
developed Bradley’s diagram by conducting 1D numerical simulations
with stoichiometric H2-CO-air and H2-air mixtures. In these studies [22,
134], 1D linear temperature gradient is used to simulate hotspot and
engine-like conditions are adopted, e.g., mixture temperature above
1000 K and pressure above 50 bar. As shown in Fig. 10(c), Bradley’s
diagram identified the upper and lower limits of detonation develop-
ment, ξl and ξu, as functions of ε. The region above the upper limit ξu
would correspond to the subsonic deflagration while the region below
the lower limit ξl would represent the supersonic deflagration and
thermal explosion (ξ = 0). Furthermore, it is noted that detonation re-
gion largely contracts below ε = 10, implying a low detonability when ε
is small, i.e., short hotspot radius and/or long excitation time.

Later, a third parameter, namely the product of the ratio, τi/τe, the
activation temperature E/R normalized by the mixture temperature, T,
and dimensionless hotspot temperature gradient, ∂ln T/∂r, where r is a
dimensionless radius, was added to better identify the autoignitive and
non-autoignitive (laminar flame mode mentioned above) regimes, as
shown in Fig. 13. The parameter value of 1500 was taken as a tentative
threshold for the onset of the non-autoignitive deflagration regime
[137].

2.2.3. Applications of Bradley’ s diagram and extension to multi-
dimensional conditions

Bradley’s diagram is often used to explain the autoignition propa-
gation mode in the literature [4,26,32,79,138,139]. For a hotspot with
temperature gradient, the following two equations deduced from Eq.

visualizations of instantaneous LES temperature fields at the auto-
ignition timing. The second uncertainty arises from the selection of the
gradient direction. For a multi-dimensional hotspot, the reaction front
propagates along multiple gradient directions, detonation could develop
once there is a gradient direction locating at the detonation region in
Brdley’s diagram; thus, a reasonable selection of gradient direction is
important. The other way to apply Bradley’s diagram in simulations is
based on statistical method, which evaluates ξ and ε for each fluid
point/mesh; this way is suitable to multi-dimensional simulations where
there are numerous hots-pots difficult to be identified separately. In this
way, r0 is usually constant and is specified experientially; ∂T/∂r is
evaluated by gradient operator for vector. Although this way cannot
describe the propagation mode of each hotspot, it can provide a pro-
pensity prediction by evaluating the percentage of (ε, ξ) points located in
Bradley’s diagram. Luong et al. [16] adopted a probability density
function of ξ, P(ξ), to predict the detonation propensity in 2D and 3D
inhomogeneous temperature fields as shown in Fig. 14(a). The detona-
tion propensity is represented by the volume fraction of the domain
prone to detonation development, FD, with

where T is the local temperature. Accurate application of Bradley’s di-
agram needs to know the local thermodynamic and compositional in-
formation to evaluate τi, τe and a for each hotspot in end-gas region, and
it also needs to know r0; this, however, is difficult to be realized in the
experiments. In experimental studies, it is usually assumed that ∂T/ ∂r in
Eq. (14) and the hotspot radius are both constant in the chamber. For
example, Kalghatgi et al. [140] gave an estimation of ∂T/ ∂r as (cid:0) 1 K/mm
or (cid:0) 2 K/mm experientially and an estimation of r0 as 5 mm considering
the clearance height at TDC in their studies of knocking combustion in
turbo-charged engines. After specifying ∂T/∂r and r0, ∂τi/ ∂T, τe and a are
evaluated based on the in-cylinder pressure and mean unburned mixture
temperature at autoignition onset.

In the numerical studies, it is straightforward to obtain detailed flow
parameters and there are two ways to apply Bradley’s diagram. One is to
identify each hotspot in the end gas and apply Bradley’ diagram to them
separately. This way is suitable to 1D simulation and multi-dimensional
simulations with a few hotspots. The advantage is that it can predict the
propagation mode of each hotspot. However, some uncertainties can
influence its accuracy. The first is the identification of the hotspot,
which is arbitrary in the literature considering hotspots are rarely reg-
ular in the realistic combustion process. For example, in the 1D simu-
lation of end-gas autoignition fueled with H2 [32], Pan et al. identified
the hotspot through OH mass fraction distribution, whereas in a large
eddy simulation (LES) study of knocking combustion under engine
conditions [10], the hotspot radii was fixed to 1 cm according to a priori

where ξl and ξu are set to 1 and 10, respectively, in their work fueled
with ethanol. As shown in Fig. 14(b), an inhomogeneous temperature
field with a larger FD, a priori, leads to a realistic heat release fraction
from detonation FH, a posteriori, with

∑

FH =

 ̇q

∑

,

(17)

where  ̇q is heat release rate (HRR) and Pe is the corresponding 0D
constant-volume equilibrium pressure for the given initial conditions.

Hotspot radius is roughly estimated in the above mentioned studies.
Under engine conditions, the inhomogeneous temperature field can be
sufficiently stirred by the turbulence; thus, the length scale of hotspots
should be correlated to the characteristic length scales of the turbulence.
The “dissipation element” theory proposed by Peters et al. [141,142]
indicated that the inhomogeneous temperature field sufficiently stirred
by the turbulence can be divided into many small sub-units, i.e., dissi-
pation elements, as show in Fig. 15. Within the dissipation elements, the
temperature distribution is monotonous. They further pointed out that
the mean length scale of dissipation elements (the mean distance be-
tween a minimum and a maximum point) is approximately 2 Taylor
length scales of the turbulence. This theory provides an important
reference for the selection of hotspot radius in the evaluation of Brad-
ley’s diagram when it is applied to multi-dimensional inhomogeneities
with turbulent mixing. Towery et al. [18] investigated detonation
initiation within an inhomogeneous temperature field that is fully
created by compressible
turbulence fluctuations. By
substituting the related quantities in Eqs. (15) and (13) with the corre-
sponding mass-averaged quantities, the new turbulence-based expres-
sions with ξt and εt denoting ξ and ε, respectively, are defined as

3. Flame propagation and pressure wave

When heat loss is neglected, the SI flame compresses the end gas
isentropically to autoignition, which is realized, in nature, through the
passing by of an infinite series of sound/pressure waves emitting from
the SI flame [1,143]. Such a process implies three essential elements in
end-gas autoignition: flame, pressure wave, and end-gas autoignition.
This section focuses on the interactions among these three essential el-
ements with emphasis on the understanding of end-gas autoignition
occurrence. The detailed combustion process and underlying mecha-
nism of flame-pressure wave interaction induced end-gas autoignition

15

are firstly discussed in Section 3.1, and then the effects of turbulent
flame speed on end-gas autoignition occurrence are demonstrated in
Section 3.2.

3.1. Flame-pressure wave interaction induced end-gas autoignition

The acoustic/pressure wave produced by SI flame is a crucial factor
to elevating the temperature and pressure of end gas, and the propa-
gation of the pressure wave emitted from end-gas autoignition is a major
cause for pressure oscillation in knocking combustion [29]. Capturing
pressure wave propagation requires an extremely refined time scale
considering the pressure wave propagates at a sonic or even supersonic
speed and the space of the engine combustion chamber is really
confined; in addition, schlieren photography is a good choice since
pressure wave possesses density gradient. In the last decades, extensive
optical diagnoses have been conducted in engines and RCMs to observe
end-gas autoignition phenomenon, in which SI propagation and auto-
ignition location [144,145], intermediate species during end-gas auto-
ignition fueled with hydrocarbon [146–148], and even detonation
development [5,149] have been analyzed. However, clear pressure
wave propagation has been rarely captured in these studies owing to the
limitation discussed above. Here, we present the observations conducted
in CVCC-TJU introduced in Section 1.3, which provides enhanced
flame-pressure wave interactions and a larger visual space, compared to
engine chambers, to give a qualitatively knowledge of the process of
flame-pressure wave interaction induced end-gas autoignition; then we
elaborate the underlying mechanism of this process with high-resolution
numerical simulations.

3.1.1. Experimental observation

The turbulent flame-shock wave interaction induced end-gas auto-
ignition and detonation development in CVCC-TJU can divided into four
stages as shown in Fig. 16, including turbulent flame acceleration, shock
wave formation, flame-shock wave interactions, and end-gas auto-
ignition and detonation development. Note that the figures in each stage
are selected from different experiments, aiming to show the clearest
process for each stage. The hydrogen was used as fuel in these studies,
the initial temperature of the mixture was within the range of 300–400
K, and the initial mixture pressure was 1–5 bar.

3.1.1.1. Turbulent flame acceleration. In this stage, a laminar semi-
spherical flame was initially ignited by the spark plug and propagated
to the right to the perforated plate, as shown in Fig. 16(a). It developed
into jet flame and then into turbulent flame after passing the perforated
plate, leading to a sudden increase in flame speed from about 21.8 m/s
to above 100 m/s. The flame speed was the measurement of the tem-
poral derivate of the flame tip position. By adjusting the perforated plate
configurations, e.g., adopting small porosity or mixture composition, the
maximum flame speed can reach up to 500 m/s. Many efforts have
focused on the turbulent flame acceleration mechanism. One traditional
explanation for flame acceleration was proposed by Shelkin [151],
which attributes the acceleration to the wall friction and turbulence. In
this mechanism, the burned gas drives a flow in the fuel mixture. The
flow soon becomes nonuniform due to the no-slip boundary condition at
wall, which together with the turbulence, distort the flame front and
increase the burning rate, ultimately promoting flame acceleration.
Bychkov et al. [85,86] provided a more stronger mechanism responsible
for flame acceleration in obstructed channels by conducting theoretical
analysis and numerical validation. The new mechanism indicated that
when the flame passed through the unobstructed region of the channel, a
delayed combustion could occur in the gap between two adjacent ob-
stacles, which led to gas expansion in the gap and then produced strong
jet flow in the central region of the channel without confinement, pro-
moting the flame acceleration. Under this mechanism, a smaller
blockage ratio will induce stronger flame acceleration, which explains
the faster flame tip velocity under smaller nozzles diameters in CVCC
experiments.

3.1.1.2. Shock wave generation. The strong flame acceleration is able to
produce a series of compression waves which coalesce and intensify into
shock wave in the confined space. Such a process is clearly shown in
Fig. 16(b). In the schlieren images, the intensity of the pressure wave
could be identified by the grayscale. Two obvious compression waves
(C1 and C2) were observed in front of the flame when it just entered the
optical window (see Frames 1 and 2). Meanwhile, there existed some
sort of weak compression waves between the flame front and C1. The
local sound speed is larger in the mixture behind the compression wave
than that ahead of the wave because of the temperature elevation across
the wave. Therefore, the compression waves in the back could catch up
with those in the front. As can be seen, as C2 propagated, it got darker
and darker, which means its intensity was enhanced as it coalesced with

3.1.1.3. Flame-pressure/shock wave interactions. As the pressure wave/
shock wave arrived at the end wall, it would be reflected back and
propagated towards the flame. The pressure wave/shock wave reversed
the flow before the flame, which consequently caused the decrease of the
flame propagation and even reversed the flame as shown in Fig. 16(c).
After shock waves reflected on the perforated plate and the left wall, it
propagated to the right again, and encountered with the flame front,
leading to the flame acceleration. Overall, the pressure wave/shock
wave would propagate back and forth in the combustion chamber and
interacted with the flame again and again, resulting in the flame speed

always a hot topic in the literature. Both planar flame-pressure wave
interactions [28,152,153] and flame bubble-pressure wave interactions
[154–157] were considered in studies. Generally, various flame shape
can be formed after it is interacted with pressure/shock waves, including
inverse/tulip flame [152], “distorted tulip” flame [27,158,159], and
highly corrugated and distorted turbulent flame. The evolution of the
flame shape is usually attributed to flame instabilities [156,160,161], e.

reflecting the pressure waves), and the ultimately chaotic flame-pressure

3.1.1.4. End-gas autoignition and detonation development induced by the
interactions. After multiple reflections of the pressure waves, end gas
autoignited near the right end wall as shown in Fig. 16(d), and then it
developed into detonation with a propagation speed of 1987 m/s, close
to the estimated local CJ speed. However, it is usually difficult for
detonation to sufficiently develop in the end-gas autoignition because
most of the fresh mixture has been consumed by the SI flame; when the
detonation entered the burned zone of the SI flame, it degenerated to
shock wave. A strong pressure oscillation with a peak pressure of 5.71
MPa was measured in the detonation case. It should be noted the pres-
sure transducer is not always able to capture the maximum pressure
along the detonation front considering the detonation propagation was
really limited and the arrangement of the pressure transducer.

3.1.2. Underlying mechanism of pressure wave reflection induced end-gas
autoignition

Even though the fundamentally experimental results conducted in
CVCC-TJU clearly captured the pressure wave propagation and end-gas
autoignition, they faced difficulties in revealing the details of the
instantaneous process of pressure wave reflection induced end-gas
autoignition owing to the limitations of measurement methods and
complications of gas motion and combustion process; thus, numerical
simulations were attempted to address this issue [8,165–168]. Fig. 17
shows a result from a high-resolution 2D simulation [15] which provides
an understanding of flame-pressure wave interplay and its induced
end-gas autoignition in a confined chamber. The study was based on a
closed rectangular channel, initially fueled by stoichiometric hydro-
gen/air mixture at the initial temperature of 1000 K and pressure of 10
atm to simulate the high-reactivity mixture under engine conditions. SI

flame was placed at X = 0.1 cm and propagated to the end wall (X = 2
cm). To focus on the effect of the pressure wave, the chamber was set to
be adiabatic and the mixture was initially quiescent so that the effects of
wall heat transfer and turbulence could be excluded. The overall evo-
lution can be divided into three processes:
I-reactivity increase,
II-critical and sensitive state, and III-coupling and detonation. In the first
stage, some pressure waves generated by the main flame coalesced into a
relatively stronger pressure wave, called the primary pressure wave
here. Such a process is similar to that described in Section 3.1.1 and not
shown here. The OH mass fraction was used to represent the reactivity of
the unburned mixture. As can be seen in Fig. 17(a), OH mass fraction
moderately increased after every time the primary pressure wave swept
past, leading to a decrease in the IDT. In addition to the primary pressure
wave, other weak pressure waves also existed, which were continually
produced owing to the heat release from the main flame; this also
gradually increase the reactivity in the unburned mixture. All these
pressure waves were reflected by the wall, propagated back and forth in
the chamber, interacted with the main flame again and again, and
formed curved and complicated pressure wave structures. At the second
process (see Fig. 17(b)), the primary pressure wave was reflected at the
right end wall for the fourth time, consequently the temperature and OH
mass fraction of the local mixture continually increased to a high level
and initiated the combustion. Note that the ignition was first initiated in
the corner region rather than in the complete end wall region adjacent to
the wall; however, before that, no noticeable difference in the temper-
ature and OH mass fraction was observed in the end wall region. A close
investigation revealed that it could be attributed to some weak pressure
waves which compressed the mixture in the corner region slightly earlier
than that at the center region due to their curved shape. After multiple
reflections of the primary pressure wave, the end gas reactivity was
improved to a critical level, which meant that the mixture was extremely
sensitive, and any small disturbance might trigger its ignition, influ-
encing the ignition time and location. At
the third process, a
high-pressure zone was built up owing to the rapid heat release form the
local autoignition, which coupled with the reaction front, evolving
finally into a detonation (see Fig. 17(c)). The peak pressure of the
detonation wave reached more than 20 MPa, which corresponds to
super knock condition in engines.

As observed in the results of CVCC-TJU and the above simulation,
end-gas autoignition triggered near the chamber wall is a common
phenomenon in knocking combustion. One of the most important rea-
sons is the pressure wave reflection at the wall [169]. Terashima et al.
[9] conducted 1D simulations to compare the temporal evolutions of the
temperature and intermediate species rise of the end-gas as a result of
pressure wave compression for n-heptane/air mixture between two lo-
cations: one adjacent to the end wall and the other slightly far from the

end wall. As shown in Fig. 18, the mixture adjacent to the wall (x = 4.0
cm) obtained a higher temperature rise owing to the pressure wave
reflection than that slightly far away from the wall (x = 3.6 cm) within
the same cycle of the pressure wave propagation, which led to a larger
production of the reactive radicals (CH2O here). The temperature dif-
ference between the two points disappeared almost completely after the
pressure wave completed one propagation cycle; however, the differ-
ence in the CH2O concentration continually accumulated with periodic
pressure wave reflections, resulting in a higher reactivity of the mixture
at the end wall and earlier autoignition there. Similar findings were also
presented by Wei et al. [170] with hydrogen as the fuel, wherein a ratio
(cid:0) 4 was employed
of the mass fraction of OH to a threshold value of 1.0e
(cid:0) 4 was
as an indicator of the autoignition progress. The value 1.0e
selected because it could be used as a criterion for the onset of auto-
ignition. Their results showed that the gradient distribution of the ratio
formed along the end gas with the highest value at the wall owing to the
inducement of the pressure wave propagation. If further considering
multi-dimensional conditions with distributed hotspots created by the
wall heat transfer, gas exchange, and fuel diffusion, the autoignition
location would be influenced by the competition between these hotspots
and those produced by the pressure waves.

The higher reactivity at the wall location means that a reactivity
gradient could form as the radicals at the wall diffuse into the sur-
rounding mixture. Therefore, inhomogeneities could be created by the
effect of pressure wave compression, by which different autoignition
propagation modes can be initiated according to the reactivity theory
[37,48,171]. Pan et al. systematically investigated the effect of pressure
wave intensity on the end-gas autoignition process and knocking in-
tensity with hydrogen as a fuel, based on 1D simulations [32]. The
pressure wave intensity was controlled by changing the ignition tem-
perature that initiated SI flame; the higher the ignition temperature is,
the weaker the pressure wave generated by it. At the same initial
mixture temperature, the end-gas autoignition modes tended to transi-
tion from detonation to mixed mode, and lastly to supersonic deflagra-
tion as the pressure wave strength was weakened, along with a rapid
decrease in the peak pressure and a significant increase in the auto-
ignition reaction front speed. The main reason for this behavior was that
the reflection of the weaker pressure wave led to a smaller difference in
the reactivity between the wall and the other end-gas regions, i.e., a
milder mixture reactivity gradient, which promoted a faster propagation
of the autoignition front according to the gradient mechanism. For the
fuel exhibiting a low-temperature ignition, cool flame evolution could
help enhance the inhomogeneity created by pressure wave reflection
through the heat release, and thus facilitate the coupling between the
shock wave and reaction front, and consequently the detonation for-
mation. Under this condition, a higher knocking intensity was encoun-
tered when the initial temperature of the mixture was within the range
that could trigger a low-temperature ignition [33,36]. However, if the

pressure wave intensity was so weak that the end-gas autoignition al-
ways occurs nearly simultaneously, the contribution of the cool flame to
the inhomogeneity could become quite negligible, and thus the
low-temperature ignition would have little influence on the end-gas
autoignition mode.
the
mixture was relatively low, the inhomogeneity created by the pressure
wave reflection would be largely dissipated owing to the longer IDT.
Under this condition, the autoignition location would be easily affected
by the transient disturbance and become random.

if the initial temperature of

In addition,

In summary, the role of a pressure wave in knocking combustion can
be understood from two perspectives corresponding to before and after
the end-gas autoignition, respectively. Before the end-gas autoignition,
the main flame imposes the compressing effect on the unburned mixture
through the propagation of pressure waves generated by it, which
continually improves the reactivity of the unburned mixture.
In-
homogeneities or hotspots can be produced by pressure wave reflection,
irregular pressure wave structure, pressure wave interactions, etc. The
intensity of the pressure wave not only affects the IDT of the end-gas
autoignition, but also determines the autoignition propagation mode
through changing the reactivity of the hotspot created by it. After the
autoignition, the propagation of the strong pressure waves generated by
the rapid heat release from the autoignition is the main cause of the
pressure oscillation in knocking combustion. The detonation developed
as a result of the coupling between the pressure wave and the auto-
ignition front can lead to a knocking intensity, one order of magnitude
larger than that under the condition with only subsonic/supersonic
deflagration propagation.

3.2. Flame speed

As discussed in Section 3.1.1, increasing flame speed can enhance the
pressure wave intensity and thus could facilitate end-gas autoignition
occurrence; however, the faster flame propagation also leaves less time
for the chemical reaction of end gas to proceed, which is averse to
autoignition occurrence. Arguments exist
in the literature about
whether increasing SI flame speed as well as burned mass fraction (BMF)
could mitigate knocking combustion. Some theoretical models have
been proposed to try to explain the contradiction.

3.2.1. Controversies over effectiveness of flame speed and burned mass
fraction (BMF)

3.2.1.1. Flame speed. Some studies have argued that increasing the
combustion rate can suppress knock intensity [61,144,172]. Hirooka
et al. [173] attempted to improve the combustion rate through injecting
high-pressure air into the unburned mixture in the later stage of com-
bustion. Additional fuel was also injected to maintain a constant air/fuel
ratio. The quantity of the injected air was about 5 % of the intake air by
mass, so its effect on end-gas temperature should be minimal. The highly
turbulent flow was created by injection in the cylinder, and effectively
increased the combustion rate. By selecting suitable injection parame-
ters, knock was alleviated and the engine performance was improved in
their study. Instead of injecting air, some studies have tried to inject
hydrogen into the end-gas region [174,175]. In addition to creating a
strong turbulence that accelerated combustion, the addition of hydrogen
also prolonged the IDT of the fuel through chemical effects, i.e., H2
addition to hydrocarbon fuel can affect the elementary reactions of the
latter, which was favorable for knock suppression. However, some other
studies [59,176,177] also found that end-gas autoignition frequently
occurred in the cycle with a fast burning rate or main flame propagation
velocity. Compressing and heating effects, related to the pressure wave
induced by a fast flame were considered to be the primary cause. In a
recent optical engine experiment with a high compression ratio [178],
turbulent flame velocity was modified by changing the in-cylinder swirl
ratios, and the turbulent flow velocity was quantified by PIV. They

pointed out that the autoignition onset is advanced by increasing tur-
bulent flame velocity which also led to an intensive heat release,
consequently enhancing the knock propensity and intensity. By using an
explanatory variable, MFB0–70 %, defined as the duration from ignition
to 70 % mass fraction burnt, Chen et al. [176] pointed out through a
series of experimental and numerical results that knocking cycles usu-
ally had shorter MFB0–70 %, compared to normal cycles. In their work, a
sine wave estimation was utilized to solve the problem that MFB0–70 %
might not be obtained from the in-cylinder pressure under knocking
conditions owing to non-uniform pressure distribution.

3.2.1.2. BMF. In addition to flame propagation, many studies [58,60,
62,179–182] also paid attention to the effect of BMF at autoignition
onset on knock intensity. The BMF could be related to flame propagation
under certain conditions.
If end-gas autoignition is inhibited by
improving the flame speed, a process wherein the BMF increases with
the flame speed should exist before the end-gas autoignition is sup-
pressed. In early time, the influence of BMF on knock intensity was
experimentally investigated based on an optical compression–expansion

engine [144,179]; it was found that more severe knock tended to take
place under the conditions with slower flame propagation and larger
unburned areas in the end gas. A two-stage linear correlation between
knock intensity and mass fraction consumed by end-gas autoignition
was obtained through LES studies of a single-cylinder engines fueled
with isooctane [10] as shown in Fig. 19 where different mass fractions
consumed by end-gas autoignition were realized by adjusting the spark

timing;
increased with the mass fraction consumed by the end-gas autoignition;
furthermore, the slope of the increase was moderate when the mass
fraction consumed by the end-gas autoignition was relatively small,
while it was more rapid when the mass fraction consumed by the
end-gas autoignition was large, which indicated a drastic change in
phenomena, such as detonation initiation. Recently, the effect of BMF on
end-gas autoignition with detonation wave was experimentally inves-
tigated by delayed active ignition in the end-gas region in CVCC-TJU
fueled with hydrogen [183]. Different time intervals, namely 0, 1, 1.5
and 2.0 ms between the active ignition in the end gas (denoting as SI-EG
hereinafter), and main ignition (denoting as MI) were investigated. It
was concluded that with a decrease in the ignition interval, the deto-
nation intensity and pressure oscillation were weakened. Consequently,
the combustion mode transitioned from detonation to normal combus-
tion, and a negative relationship between the peak pressure and the BMF
was observed as shown in Fig. 20. In addition, although most of these
studies showed that knock intensity had a monotonously negative
relation to the BMF at autoignition onset, some studies [33,55,56] found
that the relation could be non-monotonous, and that knock intensity
could increase with increased BMF at autoignition onset under certain

conditions.

3.2.2. Theoretical models describing relationship between flame speed and
end-gas autoignition

There are two theoretical models intending to describe the rela-
tionship between flame speed and end-gas autoignition, and to explain
the above arguments. One is based on uniform pressure assumption and
the other considers the pressure wave propagation.

3.2.2.1. Uniform pressure assumption. As mentioned in Section 2.1.3,
the suppression of end-gas autoignition by increasing the flame propa-
gation speed can be deduced from the L–W integral. Note that this
deduction assumes that the pressure is always uniformly distributed in
the closed chamber before autoignition; this can be especially realized
when pressure waves generated by the main flame are really weak. The
theoretical model is described in detail as follows.

Considering an ideal 1D laminar flame propagating in a closed
chamber with a cylindrical geometry filled with a uniform fresh mixture,
the L–W integral can be linked to the laminar flame speed as [55].

(24)

where Rw is the chamber radius; P0 is the initial pressure; Pe is equi-
librium pressure; γu is the specific heat ratio in unburnt mixture; Su is the
laminar flame speed; and P is the in-cylinder pressure. The following
linear relationship between the BMF and relative pressure rise is
assumed to deduce Eq. (24)

BMF = 1 (cid:0) mu / m0 = (P (cid:0) P0) / (Pe (cid:0) P0)

(25)

where mu is the mass of unburnt mixture per unit length and m0 is the
initial total mass per unit length. The detailed derivation of Eq. (24) can
be found in Ref. [55]. According to Eq. (24), L–W integral is inversely
proportional to the flame speed. To make the integral reach unity, a
larger upper limit of integral, P, in the right side of Eq. (24) is required
for faster flame speed. According to Eq. (25), a larger P corresponds to a
greater BMF. That is to say, increasing the flame speed will lead to more
mixture is consumed by the main flame before autoignition onset. When
the BMF can reach unity, autoignition will be ultimately inhibited.

The above theoretical analysis is validated by 1D numerical studies
[55]. To adjust the flame velocity while not changing the end-gas
reactivity, an artificial diffusivity, Dartif is added to the normal trans-
port parameters of the mixture. The larger Dartif is, the faster the flame

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101217

propagates. As shown in Fig. 21(a), a faster flame speed leads to a larger
flame radius, and thus a larger BMF at the autoignition onset. Auto-
ignition is finally suppressed with a flame speed that is adequately high.
However, the knock intensity shows a non-monotonic evolution, first
increasing and then decreasing; the same trend also appears in the knock
intensity evolution as a function of the BMF, as shown in Fig. 21(b).
When the unburned mixture at the autoignition onset is sufficient, the
knock intensity increases nearly linearly with the BMF. This is attributed
to a constant-volume thermal explosion induced by the autoignition. A
larger BMF corresponds to a larger pressure in the chamber at the
autoignition
higher
constant-volume combustion pressure in the end-gas, and thus causes a
stronger knock intensity. If the BMF is further increased, the unburnt
mixture in the end gas

constant-volume autoignition, and the knock intensity decreases. Based
on the above analysis, the flame speed and BMF themselves can lead to a
non-monotonic evolution of knocking intensity.

3.2.2.2. Pressure wave assumption. In contrast to the uniform pressure
assumption, a theoretical model considering a pressure wave propaga-
tion was proposed by Zhang et al. [26] to describe the relationship of
flame propagation and combustion mode transition. As shown in Fig. 22,
it is considered that a SI flame propagates from the left to the right in a
closed chamber, and a pressure wave is generated by it. Two crucial
assumptions are made in the model. The first is that the speed of the
flame, Sf , is a constant, with which the time spent by the flame
consuming all the mixture in the chamber with a length of L , tf , can be
denoted as

tf = L
Sf

.

(26)

The second assumption is that before the flame arrives at the right-
end wall the pressure wave only reflected on the right-end wall once.
Therefore, the time required by the end gas to initiate autoignition, tAI, is
the sum of the pressure wave propagation duration, tP, and ignition
delay time of the mixture after the wave reflection, tid, i.e.,

tAI = tP + tid = L

a1⋅Ma

+ tid.

(27)

where a1 is the sound speed in the unburned mixture, and Ma is the
Mach number of the pressure wave relative to the unburned gas.
Therefore, whether end-gas autoignition takes place can be represented
by a criterion, AIcriterion with

expression from the experimental data, which is universally denoted as

tid = fid(Ma, Tb, Pb).

(32)

Substituting Eqs. (29) and (32) into Eq. (28), AIcriterion can be repre-
sented as a function of the pressure wave Mach number and initial
mixture state, denoted as

where Sf (Ma) denotes Eq. (29), Sp(Ma) = a1⋅Ma, and I denotes the initial
mixture state including temperature, pressure, and composition.

Fig. 23(a) shows the profiles of tf , tAI and tid as functions of Mach
number under different initial temperatures, which were based on the
stoichiometric H2/air mixture with its initial pressure Pb = 10 atm, and
the chamber length, L = 2 cm. As can be seen, tAI coincided with tid,
when Ma was small, whereas it was determined by tP when Ma was
large. This can be easily understood because tid would decrease from a
much larger value to a much smaller one relative to tP as Ma increased, i.
e., the pressure wave intensified, consequently weakening the dominant
role of tid in tAI. It is worth noting that the number of the intersection
between tAI and tf , representing AIcriterion = 0, changed as the initial
temperature increased, meaning different autoignition transition modes
existed. Two intersections should theoretically exist when the initial
temperature was low, e.g., 900 and 950 K. However, the left intersection
close to Ma = 1 was meaningless because it corresponded to an infinite
tf , meaning that there was no flame propagation in the chamber.
Therefore, only the intersection located at a larger Ma was useful. At the
left of the intersection, AIcriterion < 0, meaning that there was no auto-
ignition; in contrast, the right part implied autoignition. As the tem-
perature was increased to approximately 1070 K, the left intersection
located at a lower Ma became meaningful, representing a lower flame
speed. Therefore, two intersections existed within this initial tempera-
ture range, implying that autoignition was suppressed first and then
promoted with increasing flame speed. When the initial temperature
exceeded 1100 K, tAI was always lower than tf and no intersection
existed, meaning that autoignition cannot be suppressed. It is worth
noting that increasing Ma to infinite, tid approached zero, and it had

tAI = tP = tf according to Fig. 23 (a). Under the condition, the flame
caught up with the pressure wave ahead of it, leading to typical DDT
process rather than end-gas autoignition.

Fig. 23(b) shows a regime diagram describing different autoignition
transition modes based on the above discussion, bounded by the initial
temperature and Ma. As Ma is positive to the flame speed, the results
indicate that with an increasing flame speed, three different transition
modes determined by the initial temperature are formed. Under a low
initial temperature (below Tl), the combustion mode transitions from
normal combustion to end-gas autoignition as the flame speed increases
to a high level and a strong pressure wave is produced. Increasing the
initial temperature can weaken the intensity of the pressure wave
required to induce autoignition. Under a moderate initial temperature
(between Tl and Tu), end-gas autoignition is first inhibited by a weak
flame speed increase, and then enhanced by a strong flame speed in-
crease. With further increase of
the no-
autoignition region disappears, and autoignition cannot be inhibited.
The three transition modes have also been confirmed by 2D numerical
studies [186], wherein obstacles with different numbers were used to
realize different flame propagation speeds.

the initial

In fact, the present theoretical model with the pressure wave
assumption includes two scenarios: weak and strong pressure waves. In
a weak pressure wave scenario, the flame speed is relatively slow; the
pressure wave produced by it is weak; and increasing the flame speed
has potential to inhibit end-gas autoignition. This scenario is similar to
the theoretical model based on uniform pressure assumption discussed
in Section 3.2.2.1, which also yields the same conclusions. In a strong
pressure wave scenario, increasing the flame speed generates a strong
pressure wave, which usually promotes end-gas autoignition. Such a
scenario corresponds to the observation made in CVCC-TJU where the
intensity of pressure wave generated by SI flame is stronger than that in
engines. Recalling the discussions on Fig. 20, autoignition was pro-
moted, i.e., from no-autoignition to end-gas detonation with increasing
the ignition interval between MI and SI-EG. The expansion of SI-EG
flame can produce the flow motion at an opposite direction to the MI
flame propagation and thus can weaken the MI flame acceleration in the
study; the longer the ignition interval was, the weaker the effect of the
SI-EG flame on the MI flame acceleration was and the faster the MI flame
was. Therefore, in the study of Fig. 20, the faster main flame speed
promotes end-gas autoignition. Fig. 24 shows another study conducted
in CVCC-TJU where different combustion modes in the end-gas region
were observed through adjusting the mixture equivalence ratio, tem-
perature, pressure, and perforated plate configurations including hole
size and porosity [25]. The detailed experimental parameters are listed
in Table 2. Here, we focus on the modes M3 and M6. When the equiv-
alence ratios and the pressures in M6 and M3 are identical, end-gas
autoignition occurred in M6 rather than M3 because M6 has smaller
perforated plate porosity and thus faster flame speed, although the
initial temperature in M6 is lower than that in M3. In short, only the
promoting effect of the strong pressure wave on end-gas autoignition
were observed in these results conducted in CVCC-TJU, as the descrip-
tion of the above model suggests. Therefore, the model with the pressure
wave assumption has a broader applicability than the model with the
uniform pressure assumption.

3.2.3. Discussions on flame speed and BMF

With the above two theoretical models in mind, the effects of flame
speed and BMF on end-gas autoignition and knocking intensity can be
considered from several aspects:

(1) Without the consideration of piston motion and mixture in-
homogeneity. This case corresponds to that described by the two
models and can be divided into two scenarios. One is the flame
speed is relatively slow, e.g., below one-tenth of the local sound
speed, in which increasing flame speed will ultimately suppress

end-gas autoignition occurrence, but the knocking intensity
might increase first and then decrease as flame speed elevation.
The other is the flame speed is large, e.g., approaching the order
of magnitude of the local sound speed, in which increasing flame
speed will promote end-gas autoignition.

(2) With the consideration of piston motion. Under this condition,
the temperature and pressure of the unburnt mixture is deter-
mined not only by the flame propagation, but also by the piston
motion which is not included in the theoretical models, so the
conclusions in (1) become uncertain. Such a phenomenon was
observed by a comprehensive LES study of a real downsized SI
engine where fuel equivalence ratio stratification was adopted
[187,188]. Comparing with using homogeneous stoichiometric
mixture, the effects of fuel stratification can be twofold: one is
decreasing the flame speed because the laminar flame speed of
PRF used in the study is the fastest under a slightly rich equiva-
lence ratio; the other is that the IDT in the rich region is shorter
because IDT decreases with equivalence ratio increase under the
thermodynamic condition considered there. If other factors are
ignored, both two effects can promote end-gas autoignition.
However, it was found that increasing fuel stratification led to
knock suppression finally. It was because fuel stratification
evidently decreased the flame propagation velocity, which
delayed the combustion phase away from TDC when the piston
motion is considered, resulting in more combustion taking place
in the expansion stroke; this weakens the increase of the tem-
perature and pressure of the end gas, suppressing the auto-
ignition. Therefore, competitive effects exist after flame
propagation decelerated. Similarly, if increasing flame speed
makes the combustion finish in a shorter time window closer to
TDC, just like advancing spark timing, the effects of piston
compression on the unburnt mixture will be magnified owing to
its coupling with the flame propagation; thus, the temperature
and pressure of the unburnt mixture are improved more rapidly
and it is easier to autoignition even though the flame speed be-
longs to the range of the first scenario in (1). For example,
Takahate et al. [189] observed that knock intensity increased
when autoignition occurred near TDC regardless of the engine
speed in a single-cylinder experiment. In addition, the later stage
of combustion in engines often locates in the expansion stroke.
Due to the volume expansion, the pressure increase is often
moderated; thus, the autoignition propensity and knock intensity
might be lower with less unburned gas, so the tendency that
knocking intensity increases with BMF as described in 3.2.2.1
might not occur.

(3) With the consideration of mixture inhomogeneity. The end
gas cannot remain homogeneous, and is characterized by
randomly distributed hotspots with inhomogeneities inside it;
therefore, the knock intensity is also determined by the localized
thermodynamic and compositional conditions, e.g., hotspot-
induced autoignition propagation mode, which makes the situa-
tion more complicated under practical engine conditions. When
the quantity of the unburned mixture is sufficient, a detonation is
more likely to develop [190]. Under this condition, the peak
pressure may be more related to the degree of detonation
development, for example, developing or stable detonation.

4. Inhomogeneity and interaction with turbulence

Owing to the spray, swirl or tumble flows with piston movement,
uneven mixing of residual exhaust gas and fresh mixture, non-uniform
temperature distribution due to the wall heat loss, and pressure wave
disturbance, non-uniformity of the flow field physical parameters
(temperature, pressure, and species concentration) are induced in
practical engines. The inhomogeneities of the physical parameters result
in reactivity gradients or local spots in the unburned mixture, which

subsequently causes end-gas autoignition and detonation. Based on the
reactivity gradient theory, different combustion modes can be devel-
oped from hotspots with various inhomogeneities, which can have direct
association with the knock intensity. This section focuses on the auto-
ignition propagation, in which the detailed evolution of autoignition
front along a simple 1D linear gradient is firstly discussed (Section 4.1),
and then autoignition propagation under multiple hotspots and multi-
dimensional conditions is analyzed as well as the effects of turbulence-
inhomogeneity interactions (Sections 4.2 and 4.3).

4.1. Linear gradient

Most of the studies on hotspot induced autoignition propagation
have continued the idea of Bradley’s work [22]. Besides temperature

gradient [41–43], it is found that the reactivity gradient theory remains
valid for the reactivity gradient induced by the composition in-
homogeneities, such as equivalence ratio [38], and additive [39], as well
as for the combination of temperature and composition inhomogeneities
[40,47]. Combustion mode transition from supersonic deflagration, to
developing detonation, and to subsonic deflagration, were observed
with an increase in the equivalence ratio gradient from 0.0039/mm to
0.72/mm, corresponding to ξ = 1 to ξ = 100 in the study fueled with
n-heptane [38], which resembled the regime induced by the tempera-
ture gradient, indicating that concentration inhomogeneities can also
lead to detonation development and super-knock in engines. The su-
perimposition of temperature gradient on the concentration gradient
could either promote or inhibit the detonation formation owing to the
counteracting or accumulating effects between the two types of gradient

configuration as a result of the curvature effects. In addition, the effect of
LTC on detonation development from a hotspot with 1D linear gradient
were investigated by Zhang et al. [47]. In order to isolate the effect of
LTC, modified chemistry mechanism for DME by excluding the reactions
related to LTC were adopted. As shown in Fig. 26(a), it is found that
detonation peninsula nearly overlapped with and without LTC, implying
that the same propagation modes can be triggered for the hot spot both
with and without LTC as long as they had the same (ξ, ε). However, it
should be noted that ∂τi/∂T is smaller with LTC than without LTC owing
to the smaller τi with LTC when other conditions, e.g., temperature,
pressure, and composition are the same; thus, according to Eq. (15) in
section 2.2.3, if the same propagation mode, i.e., the same (ξ, ε), were
realized, a larger ∂T/∂r was required with LTC than without LTC. Such a
result is shown in Fig. 26(b). Detonation region with LTC is higher than
that without LTC, i.e., a larger temperature gradient or/and concen-
tration gradient is required for detonation development with LTC than
without LTC if other conditions are the same. Furthermore, considering
Fig. 26(b) was based on a logarithmic coordinate, the detonation region
with LTC should cover a broader temperature and/or concentration
gradient range than without LTC.

4.1.2. Negative temperature coefficient effects

NTC effects have attracted much interest in the study on knocking
combustion [8,9,192]. In the NTC region, IDT increases with raising
temperature as shown in Fig. 8. Dai et al. [193] found that the
forward-propagating reaction front could be produced by the positive
temperature gradient for n-heptane/air mixture, also called coldspot,
when the mixture temperature located in the NTC region, which could
also lead to different propagation modes, including, supersonic auto-
ignition deflagration, detonation, shock-detonation, and shock defla-
gration; when (ξ, ε) corresponding to the cool-spot and hotspot was the
same in the Bradley’s diagram, the autoignition modes caused by them
would be nearly the same. Nogawa et al. [194] compared the end-gas
autoignition process in 1D simulations with large temperature stratifi-
cation through considering the fuels with and without NTC effects,
respectively. They indicated that the knocking intensity was enhanced
by the NTC effects under the same initial temperature and temperature
gradient, arising from the reduced spatial gradient of the IDT in the NTC
region, as shown in Fig. 27. In addition, it was indicated in Section 3.1.2
that pressure reflection on the wall should be a main cause for near-wall
autoignition in engines. However, some studies also considered that the
near-wall autoignition in knocking combustion was related to NTC ef-
fects [195,196]. Due to the heat loss to the wall, the mixture could have
a decreased temperature distribution from the core region to the wall. If
the mixture temperature located within NTC region, autoignition would
take place first near the wall due to shorter IDT there induced by lower
temperature. When considering wall heat transfer, 1D simulations [9,

[40,47]. Gasoline used in SI engines is mainly composed of large
molecule hydrocarbon fuels whose autoignition characteristics,
including multi-stage ignition and NTC phenomenon, are different from
those of simple fuels (CO and H2) applied to generate Bradley’s diagram
[22]. The effects of these characteristics on autoignition propagation are
focused.

4.1.1. Multi-stage ignition

For hydrocarbon fuels, multi-stage ignition, including low tempera-
ture ignition (LTI), intermediate temperature ignition (ITI) and high
temperature ignition (HTI) could occur during autoignition [48–50]. Dai
and Chen et al. [191] studied the autoignition front propagation of
n-heptane/air mixture, especially the detonation development from a
temperature gradient configuration resembling that of Bradley’s work
[22] by 1D simulations. It was found that compared to hydrogen/air
autoignition, multi-stage ignition of large hydrocarbon fuels compli-
cated the reaction-pressure wave interactions during the autoignition.
The pressure/shock waves could be produced by heat release from all
LTI, ITI, and HTI stages due to strong chemical–acoustic interactions
when the temperature gradient is suitable as shown in Fig. 25; it was also
pointed out that spherical configuration could enhance pressure wave
interactions and detonation formation compared with that in a planar

4.2. Multi-dimensional inhomogeneity

All studies discussed above are based on a single hotspot with a
simply linear reactivity gradient. However, due to turbulent mixing and
heat losses, the reactivity inhomogeneities should be random in prac-
tical engine conditions. Schießl et al. [197] demonstrated that temper-
ature fluctuations exceeding 20 K, are presented in the end-gas region,
whose geometrical size ranges from ~1 mm to ~1 cm, by analyzing the
laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) images in a single-cylinder SI engine,
experimentally giving a quantitative description of the inhomogeneities
in the engine condition. Therefore, multiple hotspots can be randomly
distributed in the unburned mixture. Autoignition of these hotspots and
interactions between them can have an impact on the combustion mode
as well as knock intensity [53,198,199].

Most of DNS studies [200–206] regarding autoignition within
multi-dimensional
inhomogeneity was conducted under HCCI and
spark-assisted CI (SACI) conditions. In these studies, the equivalence
ratio was usually small, e.g., 0.3, and detonation development was
basically avoided. Yoo et al. [203,206,207] investigated the global
autoignition combustion characteristic of a lean iso-octane/air mixture
with a temperature inhomogeneity. The morphology of the initial tem-
perature field is similar to Fig. 14 (a); the characteristic length scale of
temperature inhomogeneity, a size measure of the hotspots within it,
was 1.25 mm. Generally, when no SI flame was considered and com-
bustion was only initiated by the mixture autoignition, it was found that
with increasing thermal stratification from 15 K to 60 K, the overall
combustion is advanced; however, the mean heat release rate increases
more slowly and its peak is reduced as shown in Fig. 28(a). The earlier
combustion phase in higher thermal stratification can be easily under-
stood: when the initial mean temperature is the same, the larger tem-
perature inhomogeneity leads to a higher temperature of hotspots whose
autoignition initiates combustion earlier. In addition, a larger temper-
ature inhomogeneity also results in autoignition propagation mode
tending to be subsonic deflagration controlled by thermal and species
diffusion rather than spontaneous ignition, i.e., supersonic deflagration
controlled by the reactivity gradient. This is verified in Fig. 28(b) which
shows the fraction of HRR from deflagration before the time of HRR
ʹ = 60 K, whereas it decreases to below 20 %
peak is close to 50 % for T
ʹ = 15 K; the larger fraction of
for T
subsonic deflagration decelerates the global combustion rate and thus
broadens the HRR evolution and decreases HRR peak. It is also noted
that the fraction of subsonic deflagration decreases at the later stage of
combustion when HRR is arriving its peak value for all three cases; this is
because the temperature of the remainder mixture is continually
improved as the combustion proceeds and its IDT is reduced, which
causes the local reactivity gradient is decreased and the combustion
tends to be supersonic deflagration or thermal explosion. The evolution
of the propagation mode within such a 2D temperature inhomogeneity is
consistent to the gradient theory.

ʹ = 30 K and even vanishes for T

Only a limited number of studies have quantitatively investigated the
effects of temperature inhomogeneity on detonation combustion [52].

37] showed that the existence of cold wall led to the wall reflections of
pressure wave-induced autoignition taking place outside the thermal
boundary layer, and detonations being initiated on both sides of the
exothermic center with hydrogen as fuel; however, for fuels with NTC
effects, it was expected that the autoignition onset could be initiated
outside and inside the thermal boundary layer simultaneously, owing to
the high reactivity created by the pressure wave reflection and low
temperature within the NTC region, respectively. However, the recent
experimental study in an RCM [45,46] found that NTC may not be
crucial in the near-wall autoignition. The study [45] considered two
fuels,
including iso-octane/O2/N2 with NTC behavior and diluted
methanol/O2/Ar without NTC behavior. Two-stage ignition process was
observed in the end-gas autoignition of iso-octane mixture. After LTC,
two autoignition events, taking place sequentially within a short time
interval, were captured near the wall region. However, the calculation of
the mixture temperature evolution from spark ignition to autoignition
onset indicated that it bypassed the NTC region. Therefore, the near wall
autoignition was not attributed to NTC effects. Furthermore, near-wall
autoignition was also observed for the methanol mixture which, how-
ever, does not have NTC behavior. Thus, it seems that the NTC effect
provides an additional pathway for knock occurrence, e.g., cool-spot,
and can influence the knock intensity; however, it does not appear to
be an essential requirement for near-wall autoignition.

detonation kernels usually originate from the regions in which two or
multiple pressure waves generated by multiple hotspots collision. In
order to have a deep understanding of the effect of multiple hotspot
interaction on detonation formation, a simplified 1D simulation was
conducted for PRF40/air mixture [51] in which two neighboring hot-
spots were simulated by sine-wave temperature distribution. It was

found that a detonation wave was more likely to form when the distance
between two hotspots was smaller, in which the pressure waves gener-
ated from the two hotspots can be easier to superimpose with each other
to initiate detonation.

4.3. Turbulence–inhomogeneity interactions

Under practical conditions, reactivity inhomogeneity is usually
correlated to turbulent mixing. Some results [135,208] revealed that the
successful autoignition of hotspots, with the presence of turbulence, was
dominated by the heat and species dissipation, and local mixing they
experienced. The large and aggregate hotspots which experienced low
dissipation are more likely to autoignition. For a prescribed inhomoge-
neous field under adiabatic conditions, e.g., the field shown in Fig. 14
(a), turbulent mixing tends to homogenize the inhomogeneity, which
has an equivalent effect to reducing the initial inhomogeneity. The
turbulence intensity can be characterized by three parameters, i.e., the
characteristic length scales of turbulence, le, turbulence velocity fluc-
ʹ
ʹ
, and turbulent eddy-turnover time τt = le/ u
tuation, u
. As shown in
Fig. 30, a more rapid HRR rise and a larger HRR peak were reached
ʹ
(comparing Case 1 and Case 8) when the turbulence with a greater u
but
equal le was imposed on the initial temperature inhomogeneity; the
ʹ
tendency was similar to reducing T
in Fig. 28(a). However, it is also
noted that the effects of turbulent mixing could become marginal if the
length scale of turbulence is smaller than that of the inhomogeneity
fluctuation (comparing Case 1 and Case 9) [202]. Yu et al. [201]
compared the ignition difference under mixing by 2D and 3D turbu-
lence. It was revealed that the extra dimension in 3D provided a higher
velocity strain rate, and hence facilitated the heat transfer, leading to a
faster mixing of the temperature. Consequently, a delayed, but more
rapid heat release occurs in 3D. Recently, a 1D simulation was con-
ducted to investigate the effects of turbulence on end-gas autoignition
[209,210] where a linear temperature gradient with a length of 3 mm
was used to simulate the thermal boundary layer of the end-gas close to
the cold cylinder wall in engines. It was found that the increased tur-
bulence intensity enhanced heat and radical dissipation, delayed the
autoignition timing, and shrunk the size of initial autoignition kernel.

However, once the ignition was initiated by the kernel, the increased
turbulence intensity led to a faster propagation of the reaction front due
to more homogeneous unburned mixtures and the extended preheating
zone. When the length scale of turbulence was comparable with the size
of the autoignition kernel, the dissipation effect of the turbulence
became more pronounced, and spontaneous ignition (supersonic defla-
gration) was more likely to occur.

In addition, some studies [47,63,211] have attempted to study the
influence of
turbulence-inhomogeneity interaction on the most
destructive phenomenon, namely the detonation development. Zhang
et al. [47] demonstrated that for a linear temperature/concentration
ʹ
gradient which can initiate detonation, a large le with a large u
could
strengthen the mixing between the hotspot and surrounding unburned
mixture, leading to the reduction of the temperature gradient, and
preventing the detonation. In contrast to the above study which used a
linear gradient, a few studies have attempted to reveal the effects of
turbulence on detonation development with the presence of
multi-dimensional inhomogeneous fluctuations closer to realistic con-
ditions. Luong et al. [211] clarified the effects of the characteristic pa-
rameters of turbulence on the detonation propensity for thermally
inhomogeneous stoichiometric ethanol/air mixture with temperature
ʹ = 15 K. The detonation propensity was evaluated by the fraction
RMS T
of HRR from the regions with pressure greater than von Neumann
pressure, PVN corresponding to the initial mean condition, i.e.,

Two characteristic length scales of temperature, lT = 1 mm and 5
mm, and two characteristic length scales of turbulence, le = 1 mm and 5

cases with lT = 1 mm. It can be seen that as le and u
both rose, the
combustion became more violent and maximum pressure in the domain

was promoted by the turbulent mixing with a larger le; for a large lT, the
detonation was mitigated by turbulent mixing with a smaller le; in
addition, both the cases required turbulent intensity strong enough to
ʹ = 83.3 m/s here, which causes τig/
ensure sufficiently mixing, e.g., u
τt = 1 for the former, and τig/ τt = 5 for the latter; τig is IDT of the
mixture. In Bradley’s diagram, it is pointed that ε is proportional to
hotspot radius, and small ε reduces detonation region. Recalling the
“dissipation element” theory in Section 2.2.3, the characteristic length
scale of hotspots within the inhomogeneous field is equivalent to that of
turbulence when turbulent mixing is sufficient; thus, large le extended
the run-up distance for the detonation development whereas the small le
limited the detonation development in the above study. Through a
similar method, a recent work by Pan et al. [63] investigated the effects
of turbulence intensity on detonation development for a stoichiometric
hydrogen/air mixture. However, this work indicated that the smaller le
(l.25 mm in the study) than lT (4 mm) facilitated the detonation devel-
opment in terms of earlier transition timing, shorter transition distance,
and more reaction fronts. The contradictory result between the two
studies may be explained as follows: First, the effect of the fuel; there
existed a threshold value of the distance required for the successful
detonation initiation, which was shorter for hydrogen than for ethanol.
The length scale of 1 mm may be lower than the threshold value of
ethanol; therefore, the detonation was mitigated in Luong’s work [211];
on the contrary, it was larger than the threshold of hydrogen and the
turbulent mixing led to more break-up of hotspots and enhanced the
interactions between them, causing detonation promotion in Pan’s
work. Second, the effects of the statistical method. Pan’ s work focused
more on the detonation behavior of a single or several hotspots, whereas
Luong’s work drew its conclusion based on the global heat release from
the detonation in the whole chamber. Therefore, the contradictory
ʹ
conclusions were due to the different perspectives of the view. Lastly, u
in Pan’s work was too low to break up the hotspots sufficiently to a small
scale that can inhibit the detonation development. However, both
studies pointed out that detonation was more likely to occur in the later
stage of the combustion. This should be attributed to the extremely high
reactivity and the gentle reactivity gradient of the hotspots owing to the
compression from the early combustion. In addition, it was also found
that the interactions among multiple hotspots can enhance detonation
initiation and collisions among multiple detonation fronts can lead to
high-pressure spikes.

Most of the numerical simulations discussed above were based on a
prescribed inhomogeneous filed and they usually indicate that the tur-
bulence homogenizes the inhomogeneity. However, some different
findings exist in other studies [212]. An investigation of the effect of
turbulence on end-gas autoignition was conducted in a RCM experi-
mentally and numerically where the perforated plate was inserted in the
cylinder to control the turbulence intensity as shown in Fig. 32(a) [213,
It is shown in Fig. 32(b) that after compression end, the

temperature distribution in the cylinder became broader and broader
and the peak temperature decreased as time elapsed, implying a higher
inhomogeneity was forming with turbulent mixing; it is attributed to the
reason that turbulence tended to entrain more gas in the cold thermal
boundary on the cylinder wall to the core region in the combustion
chamber. It is also noted that the peak temperature was lower and the
temperature distribution was broader under the condition with strong
turbulence than that with weak turbulence, which could be because the
inhomogeneity of the latter dissipated faster. The larger inhomogeneity
arising from the stronger turbulence led to the end-gas autoignition
transitioning from a nearly simultaneous combustion, i.e., thermal ex-
plosion, to a discrete and sequential spontaneous ignition, i.e., subsonic
deflagration. The higher the inhomogeneity, the longer the end-gas
combustion period, and the weaker the pressure oscillation. Recently,
based on a similar method to generate the turbulent flow filed, the effect
stoichiometric
of
intensity on the pre-ignition of
iso-octane/air was investigated in an RCM [64];
found that
it
pre-ignition arising from inhomogeneity can be easily triggered at a
large turbulent integral length scale and a small laminar flame thickness.
The DNS study of [215] showed that the interaction of large scale flow
motions with the cold walls during a compression stroke created strong
thermal stratification at the TDC, where regions with local temperature
below 980 K were adjacent to those with a local temperature above
1200 K in the cylinder center. Therefore, these above studies seem to
indicate that turbulence can enhance thermal inhomogeneity with the
presence of wall heat transfer.

turbulence

A recent numerical study [216] further considered the effects of
temperature inhomogeneity induced by turbulent-wall heat losses in-
teractions on end-gas autoignition and detonation development for
hydrogen/air mixture. A rectangular chamber with isothermal wall
boundaries and initial thermal boundary layer was adopted to simulate
the cross-section of engine chamber at TDC as shown in Fig. 33(a). At the
initial temperature of 1000 K and the equivalence ratio of 0.6, it was
ʹ
found that increasing le from 1.25 mm to 5 mm and u
from 5 m/s to 40
m/s, end-gas autoignition was finally inhibited, owing to the flame
speed elevation and the prolongation of end-gas IDT induced by the
enhanced wall heat losses, as has been discussed in Section 3.2. More
interesting is the end-gas autoignition propagation and detonation
development in the cases with end-gas autoignition. Comparing Fig. 33
(b) and (c), it can be found that turbulence-wall heat losses interaction
enhances the temperature inhomogeneity of the end gas, consistent with
the above discussions. In the adiabatic case (Fig. 33(b)), supersonic
deflagration occurs in the end gas and it swept over the whole end-gas
within an extremely short time. For the isothermal wall case in Fig. 33
(c), le was one quarter of the chamber height, and the end-gas in the core
region was rarely influenced by the cold flow before autoignition owing
to the small le; thus thermal explosion occurs in the core region first due
to the nearly homogeneous mixture there. As the autoignition front

entered the region where cold flow had mixed with the high temperature
gas, detonation developed at the zone with a suitable temperature
gradient which can be validated by the pressure larger than PVN. How-
ever, it was further found that the detonation propagation was unstable
when the equivalence ratio was lower, e.g., 0.6 here, it can degenerate
into decoupled shock wave and reaction front when it encountered the
cold flow. With an unstable detonation propagation, knock intensity
could be negatively related to BMF because the meeting between the
detonation and cold flow can become more frequent when less mixture
was left. However, detonation can propagate stably in the cold flow after
increasing the equivalence ratio to 0.8; under this condition, the

maximum pressure in the chamber would strongly depend on the local
and instantaneous interactions between the pressure/shock waves, and
the effect of the BMF became insignificant. These findings also indicated
the uncertainty of the effect of BMF on knocking intensity discussed in
Section 3.2.3.

In summary, different autoignition propagation modes can be initi-
ated along a linear reactivity gradient of temperature, equivalence ratio,
additive, etc., and the presence of multi-stage ignition and NTC phe-
nomenon can complicate the autoignition front evolution. For multi-
dimensional inhomogeneity, the combustion mode is not only deter-
mined by the gradient of a single hotspot, but also influenced by the

29

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101217

interactions among the hotspots which could promote detonation
development. Turbulent mixing homogenizes the mixture reactivity
fluctuation and promotes a uniform and instantaneous ignition; how-
ever, with the existence of wall heat loss, turbulence may also increase
the temperature range by entraining cold flow near the wall into the core
region, and prolong the combustion time of the end gas; under the
condition, detonation propagation could become unstable when it en-
counters the cold flow. Additionally, turbulence with a small length
scale and high velocity may promote detonation formation by creating
more broken-up hotspots and stretched hotspots; however. it also might
inhibit the detonation owing to the shortening of its developing dis-
tance. Therefore, the effect of turbulence on hotspot detonability re-
mains unclear and needs to be further investigated.

5. Chemical reactivity and thermodynamic condition

Although it is not exactly defined previously, the term “reactivity” is
mainly related to the IDT of mixture in the present work; thus, the
chemical reactivity can directly affect autoignition occurrence accord-
ing to the discussions in Section 3. On the other hand, parameters
determining chemical reactivity, e.g., fuel type, can affect autoignition
propagation modes [71]. The study [43] indicated that detonation
peninsula in Bradley’s diagram is quantitatively different for various
fuels, as shown in Fig. 34(a); this could be attributed to the distinct
physicochemical properties among different fuels, e.g., IDTs, diffusion,
and transport processes which can affect the thermal conduction and
species diffusion during induction time and thus changes the initial
reactivity gradient at different degrees. Another parameter determining

30

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101217

fuel reactivity, temperature, also has a similar influence like fuel type.
As shown in Fig. 34(b), detonation peninsula does not overlap under
different initial temperatures for stoichiometric DME/air mixture [41].
Some studies attribute this difference to energy density which can be
affected by thermodynamic conditions involving temperature and
pressure [38,139]. These differences in detonation peninsula indicates
that the autoignition propagation cannot be completely explained by a
unified Bradley’s diagram. The influences of chemical reactivity and
thermodynamic conditions should be considered additionally. There-
fore, this section mainly focuses on the effects of factors related to
chemical reactivity and thermodynamic conditions, involving fuel type
(Section 5.1), dilute gas (Section 5.2), initial temperature and energy
density (Section 5.3) on end-gas autoignition including autoignition
occurrence and autoignition propagation.

5.1. Fuel type

In practical SI engine, the octane number (ON) is employed to
evaluate the knock resistance of fuels in general, including Research
Octane Number (RON) and Motor Octane Number (MON). RON and
MON are evaluated under specific operating conditions in Cooperative
Fuels Research (CFR) engines according to ASTM methods during a long
period [74]. In general, fuels with higher ON demonstrate better
anti-knock ability than fuels with lower ON values. However, only RON
or MON cannot well describe the anti-knock feature of real trans-
portation fuels due to the tests of RON and MON are limited to a specific
condition while the actual engine operating conditions are variable [65,
68,217]. Therefore, the concept of octane sensitivity (OS) was intro-
duced to describe the true anti-knock quality of practical fuels, which
was defined as the OS= RON(cid:0) MON, and a “K-value” method proposed
by Kalghatgi [218,219] was utilized to correlate the Octane Index (OI)
and OS by a linear weighting factor, K, i.e., OI = RON (cid:0) K*OS, where K is
experimentally determinable and depends on engine operation condi-
tions. Based on the method, many efforts [65–67] in recent years have
been made to further understand the relation of OI and its parameters to
the knock resistance for modern engines by combining engine experi-
ments and numerical simulations. It can be found that the K-value has a
positive relation to intake temperature and engine speed whereas it is
negatively related to intake pressure [220]. Under “beyond RON” con-
dition, fuel-specific properties could play a more important role in knock
resistance than OS as the increase of compression ratio. It is found that
Ethanol Reference Fuels (ERFs) has a better capability of knock resis-
tance than Toluene Reference Fuels (TRFs) with equal OS under high CR
conditions [66]. It is worth stressing that in terms of the understanding
of ON effects on the autoignition behavior, a comprehensive review
regarding the impact of the chemistry behind octane boosters and sub-
sequently design rules for designing the future gasolines was presented
[221].

5.1.1. Hydrocarbon fuels

The physicochemical characteristics of fuel significantly influence
flame propagation, and end-gas autoignition process [60,61,72,73].
Noted that, the above methods give us a view of anti-knock ability of
different fuels; however, they cannot present the fundamentally physical
phenomena. Therefore, some fundamental optical experiments have
been conducted to understand the detailed combustion of flame prop-
agation and end-gas autoignition for different fuels [45,69,70]. An
investigation conducted in CVCC-TJU was shown in Fig. 35, which
considered various fuels including hydrogen, PRF50, methane, n-hep-
tane and isooctane [222]. Different oxygen concentrations were intro-
duced to realize the transition from normal combustion to end-gas
autoignition. The oxygen concentration was defined as

oxygen concentration =

noxygen
noxygen + nnitrogen

where noxygen and nnitrogen denote the mole number of oxygen and nitro-
gen. The mixture was stoichiometric and the quantities of fuel and ox-
ygen remained constant for different oxygen concentrations. Oxygen
concentration was adjusted by changing the quantities of nitrogen and
thus the initial pressure was different for various oxygen concentration.
In order to exclude the effects of initial pressure, the knock intensity was
represented by a normalized maximum pressure in the cylinder,
PMax/Pequ where Pequ is equilibrium pressure corresponding to the initial
conditions. As shown in Fig. 35(a), following the increase of oxygen
concentration, the knock intensity increased, and the combustion mode
transition from the normal combustion to detonation combustion was
observed. In the normal combustion, the maximum pressure arose from
the shock wave generated by the flame acceleration as discussed in
Section 3.1.1. Larger oxygen concentration can increase flame speed,
enhance the shock wave intensity, and consequently promote end-gas
autoignition. A critical oxygen concentration can be defined for each
fuel as the minimum oxygen concentration that can induce end-gas
autoignition. It can be seen that the critical oxygen concentration
decreased in the order: 60 % for methane, 46 % for isooctane, 44 % for
PRF50, 41 % for n-heptane, and 27 % for hydrogen. With the auto-
ignition, the knock intensity was determined by the pressure wave
produced by the autoignition front. It is noted that the knock intensity
can be different in multiple experiments with the same fuel and oxygen
concentration, which was attributed to the stochasticity of detonation as
will be discussed in Section 6.1.2. Fig. 35(d) shows the detailed com-
bustion process for different fuels at their critical oxygen concentration.
The combustion processes for different fuel were qualitatively similar
where a shock wave and a detonation with a propagation speed close to
2000 m/s were observed for each fuel. The difference in the critical
oxygen concentration for different fuels can be attributed to the com-
bined effects of the flame propagation characteristic of fuel, e.g., laminar
burning velocity, and autoignition characteristic of fuel, i.e., IDT. As
shown in Fig. 35(b), when other conditions are identical, hydrogen has
the fastest flame speed, followed by n-heptane, PRF50, isooctane, and
methane in order. On the other hand, in general, methane has the
longest IDT, followed by hydrogen, isooctane, PRF50 and n-heptane as
shown in Fig. 35(c). The fuel with longer IDT requires stronger shock
wave to induce autoignition and thus needs faster flame speed. If the
burning rate determined by the fuel characteristic itself is lower, a larger
oxygen concentration is required for the fuel to realize flame accelera-
tion. That is why the critical oxygen concentration of methane was the
largest. Note that although the hydrogen has the second longest IDT, its
burning rate determined by the fuel characteristic itself is nearly one
order of magnitude larger than other fuels a shown in Fig. 35(b), so its
critical oxygen concentration was lowest. Note that oxygen concentra-
tion mainly affects flame speed while it hardly affects IDT as shown in
Fig. 35(c). However, the study does not reflect clear difference in
detonation development for different fuels. A similar investigation for
gasoline fuel indicated that detonation can be trigged for gasoline fuel at
a flame speed of half of that required for hydrogen [69].

5.1.2. NH3-H2/ammonia addition

As a carbon-free fuel, utilizing ammonia in IC engines has attracted
much attention. However, ammonia suffers from high autoignition tem-
perature, low flame velocity, narrow flammability limit [223], which re-
stricts the application of NH3 engine. In this regard, blending NH3 with
more high reactive fuels such as H2, becomes the effective way to achieve
stable combustion. However, increasing the blending ratio of H2 will
introduce the knocking combustion risk under elevated thermodynamic
conditions and detonation could be initiated in NH3/H2 mixture [224,225].
1D simulations [75] under engine relevant conditions of initial pressure of
40 atm and temperature of 1000 K revealed that compared to the deto-
nation peninsula of the lean-H2, increasing hydrogen blending ratio in
NH3/H2 mixture up to 80 % can result in a rapid heat dissipation of the
hotspot, which consequently leads to a decrease of the transient ξ over time
and increases the detonation propensity. Fig. 36(a) shows the flame

propagation, end-gas autoignition and detonation behaviors of NH3/H2
blends observed in a full-field-visualized RCM [76]. For the 10 % of H2
energy fraction with the temperature and pressure at TDC of TEOC = 915 K
and pEOC = 30 bar, the strong end-gas autoignition were initiated near the
cylinder wall (see 5.868 ms). The autoignition front propagated at a highest
speed of 1812 m/s, close to the local theoretical CJ speed, and thus could
be characterized as a detonation whose propagation led to a pressure
oscillation with the maximum amplitude of 101 bar; as a comparison, the
maximum amplitude for pure NH3 at 985 K and 30 bar was 77 bar. As to
pure NH3, increasing mixture temperature led to a reaction pathway con-
version. As shown in Fig. 36(b), at TEOC = 845 K, NH3 is mainly consumed
through the pathway NH3→NH2→N2H4→N2H3→N2H2→NNH→N2, while
at TEOC = 985 K, additional NO-, NO2-, and H2NO-related reactions were
activated, as shown by the red dashed box in Fig. 36(b), which could
produce a large amount of heat during induction time, and thus increased
the reactivity of end gas and promoted its autoignition. As to NH3/H2
blends, increasing H2 energy fraction from 0 to 10 could result in the most
exothermic reaction NH2 +NO = N2 + H2O changing to H + O2 (+M) =
HO2 (+M), improving heat release and promoting end-gas autoignition.

It is also noted that ammonia possesses an excellent antiknock
capability, with its octane number up to approximately 130 [226].
Therefore, a few studies have been performed to investigate the in-
fluences of NH3 addition on knock migration for gasoline, hydrogen and

kerosene engines [227–229]. They found that blending ammonia could
resist engine knock and improve thermal efficiency, and the maximum
increase of thermal efficiency and engine load is about 2.46 % in a
gasoline engine with CR of 15.5 [227]. It should be noted that higher
ammonia concentration can worsen the engine performance due to the
low energy density and low flame velocity [228]. In a RCM [230], when
the molar fraction of NH3 in NH3/isooctane blends increased from 0 % to
80 %, the propagation modes of end-gas autoignition transitioned from
supersonic deflagration and detonation to subsonic deflagration finally
under the temperature and pressure at TDC of 650 K and 16 bar, leading
to a decrease in knock intensity, but the inhibiting effects were less
pronounced at high-temperature conditions (840 K in the study). Zhang
et al. [230] pointed out that the inhibiting effects of NH3 addition on
end-gas autoignition was attributed to the decrease in OH radical of heat
release rate at autoignition onset affected by NH3-related reactions.

5.2. Diluent gas

EGR, e.g., CO2 and H2O, are considered an effective method to knock
suppression in real engines. Zhao et al. [70] utilized an exhaust gas
(water vapor and nitrogen) left from a previous experiment to achieve
EGR. Through the analysis of four different exhaust gas ratios (1.67 %,
3.33 %, 5 %, and 6.67 %), it was found that increasing the EGR

decreased the probability of end-gas autoignition with detonation
development of H2-O2-N2 mixture. At an EGR of up to 6.67 %, the flame
tip velocity and amplitude of pressure oscillation decreased, and the
end-gas autoignition was inhibited. Overall, an increase of EGR
decreased the flame propagation velocity, and more importantly
decreased the reactivity of end-gas, leading to a low probability of
end-gas autoignition. Therefore, comprehensively understanding the
effects of diluent gas on end-gas autoignition, and particularly detona-
tion development makes contribution to reducing pressure oscillations
and optimizing engine performance. Numerous studies [77,231–233]
focusing on the impact of inert gas addition on flame propagation and its
transition to detonation have shown that the increasing dilution ratio
could suppress detonation transition. A comprehensive study was con-
ducted to investigate the effects of diluent gas, including N2, CO2, and Ar
on the end-gas autoignition as well as detonation in CVCC-TJU [78].
Similar to the investigation discussed in Section 5.1 for fuel type, oxygen
concentrations were introduced to realize the transition from normal
combustion to end-gas autoignition under different diluent gases. It was
concluded that the critical oxygen concentration required for initiating
end-gas autoignition and detonation is highest for CO2, followed by N2
and Ar in order, and the knock intensity would notably reduce with the
addition of CO2, as shown in Fig. 37. In section 5.1, it was pointed out
that the fuel type affects end-gas autoignition through the combined and
effects of the flame propagation characteristic of fuel and IDT. As to the
diluent gas, its effects are also two folds. On the one hand, it can also
affect the flame speed of the mixture directly, and the addition of CO2
can lead to the strongest reduction of flame propagation speed and thus
weakened the shock intensity when other conditions are identical, fol-
lowed by N2 and Ar in order. On the other hand, considering the dif-
ference in IDT of the mixture diluted by different diluent gases is slight
when other conditions, including temperature, pressure, equivalence
ratio, oxygen concentration, are identical, the diluent gas affect IDT
mainly through its thermal effect, i.e., the largest specific heat capacity
of CO2 theoretically results in a lowest end-gas temperature, and thus
prolongs its IDT, followed by N2 and Ar in order. In addition, it was
further indicated that changing the diluent gas from Ar to CO2 would
reduce the detonation stability and propagation, lead to the detonation

deficit, and thus the knock intensity decreases in the order of Ar, N2, and
CO2. All these studies indicated that CO2 had more potential than N2 and
Ar for inhibiting end-gas autoignition and detonation development.

5.3. Initial temperature and energy density

For the fuels without the NTC effect, its IDT usually shortens as the
temperature increases, under which conditions end-gas autoignition can
be easily induced. It has been mentioned that increasing the initial
temperature promotes end-gas autoignition when pressure wave in-
tensity is close in section 3.2.2.2, although that section mainly focused
on the effects of flame speed and pressure wave intensity on end-gas
autoignition. In addition to the promoting effects on end-gas auto-
ignition occurrence, some studies [32,166,170,234] have shown that
the initial temperature also has a significant influence on the transition
between two typical autoignition locations, namely end-gas autoignition
and flame-front autoignition as shown in Fig. 38. Generally, a higher
initial mixture temperature promotes the end-gas to flame-front auto-
ignition transition. Different autoignition modes can arise from the local
thermodynamic conditions when the pressure waves generated by the
through the mixture. Under a relatively low
main flame pass

temperature, when the pressure waves generated by the main flame pass
through the unburned mixture for the first time, their compression is too
weak to initiate the autoignition of the unburned mixture directly. Only
when the pressure waves are reflected from the end wall and compress
the mixture repeatedly does the autoignition take place. Under this
condition, end-gas autoignition usually occurs due to the reactivity
difference accumulation as discussed in Section 3.1.2. On the contrary,
under a high initial temperature, the reactivity of the unburned mixture
downstream is already adequately high and the mixture near the flame
front can also benefit from the heat and reactive radicals produced from
the flame so that once the pressure waves pass through that location,
autoignition takes place ahead of the flame-front rather than waiting for
their reflections.

The above analysis indicates that the effects of pressure wave and
temperature can be complementary. Given that the pressure wave in-
tensity can be related to flame speed as discussed in Section 3.2.2.2 and
temperature directly affects IDT, it should be considered that the factors
able to contribute to flame speed and/or IDT could lead to the above
transition; this was validated by the experiments in CVCC-TJU as shown
in Fig. 39. Using a single perforated plate, increasing oxygen concen-
tration from 18 % to 21 % and to 32 %, the combustion mode transi-
tioned from no autoignition (Mode 1), to end-gas autoignition without
detonation (Mode 2), and to end-wall detonation (Mode 3). With further
adding the second perforated plate, the main flame speed increased
substantially compared to Mode 3 under the same oxygen concentration
of 32 %. Consequently, side-wall detonation (Mode 4) was observed,
which led to the strongest pressure oscillation. Such a tendency was
summarized in a coordinate diagram with flame speed as abscissa and
chemical reactivity as ordinate. Some factors affecting chemical reac-
tivity also play a role in flame speed, e.g., oxygen concentration,
equivalence ratio, but the flame speed is separated from chemical
reactivity here considering it can also by some independent factors, e.g.,
turbulence intensity induced by perforated plates here. It is expected
that in addition to temperature, other factors affecting chemical reac-
tivity, e.g., fuel type and dilute gas discussed in the last two subsections
could also lead to such a transition.

Although increasing initial temperature directly promotes end-gas
autoignition occurrence in terms of advancing autoignition timing, it
does not mean that an increase in temperature always enhance the
knock intensity [56]. Qi et al. [5,19,139,169] comprehensively inves-
tigated the effects of thermodynamic conditions involving temperature
and pressure on end-gas autoignition in an optical RCM. They clearly
observed the hotspot-induced detonation combustion process and
demonstrated its similarity to the super-knock phenomenon in real en-
gines. Three end-gas combustion modes, namely no-autoignition,
sequential autoignition, and detonation propagation, were captured
with the initial pressure rise. They ultimately attributed the combustion
mode transition to energy density evolution. A larger energy density, i.
e., a higher pressure and/or lower temperature could facilitate the
detonation formation [139]. A similar effect of energy density on knock
intensity was also observed in the study [80] which compared the knock
characteristics under CI and SI conditions fueled with premixed
iso-octane/air mixture. They further pointed out that the knock intensity
was more sensitive to the equivalence ratio and initial pressure than
initial temperature. Considering that the energy density cannot be re-
flected by the IDT and excitation time, the energy density and Bradley’s
diagram can be regarded as two independent ways to describe the
autoignition propagation. Therefore, in addition to (ξ, ε), a complete
description of autoignition propagation needs to further consider energy
density.

In summary, chemical reactivity and thermodynamic condition can
affect autoignition occurrence and propagation. Specifically, fuel type
can affect the flame speed and IDT of end gas, while diluent gas plays a
role in flame speed and temperature evolution of end gas. Increasing
mixture temperature and thus improving chemical reactivity can result
in end-gas autoignition to flame front autoignition transition; on the

other hand, the effect of mixture temperature on end-gas autoignition
can also be explained by energy density. In ceasing energy density can
promote detonation development. However, the effects of fuel type and
energy density on autoignition propagation mode cannot be completely
explained by Bradley’s diagram and should be further investigated.

6. Discussions, inspirations, and prospects

With all the findings reviewed above in mind, in this section we
would like to provide discussions on the characteristics of end-gas
autoignition and detonation development in confined space (Section
6.1), then to demonstrate the inspirations obtained from the present
fundamental studies for the engineering applications as a callback to
Section 1.2 (Section 6.2), and lastly to point out the future challenges in
this topic (Section 6.3).

6.1. Discussions

6.1.1. Detonation in IC engines and DDT in ducts

As discussed in Section 2.2, different propagation modes might be
induced by end-gas autoignition, among which the appearance of
detonation is catastrophic in SI engine operation. Detonation is a
fundamental combustion phenomenon, which is associated with astro-
physical explosions [235], fire safety [236], and detonation based pro-
pulsion [237]. The DDT is a universal process leading to detonation
initiation in most scenarios. There have been extensive studies focusing
on the DDT process in the past decades [238–240]; however, its detailed
discussion is beyond the scope of the present review, and one can refer to
some excellent previous reviews [241,242]. Studies of DDT help us
understand the fundamental mechanisms of the super-knock phenome-
non in SI engines and answer the questions including whether the
occurrence of detonation is possible in SI engines and how detonation
combustion happens in small confined spaces. Here, a brief description
of the DDT phenomenon is provided to highlight the similarity and
uniqueness of detonation in engines and DDT in ducts.

6.1.1.1. DDT in ducts and hotspot formation. Shelkin [243] first quali-
tatively explained DDT process: detonation occurs if a shock wave can be
formed ahead of the flame arising from sufficient energy released by the
reaction and it is strong enough to autoignite the mixture before it is
consumed by the following flame. Most of studies on DDT have been
conducted in long ducts or tubes, as shown in Fig. 40 [244–246], where
the DDT process usually consists of two separate stages [242]: the first
involves creating the hotspots suitable for detonation initiation, and the
second involves the hotspot autoignition to detonation transition ac-
cording to the aforementioned reactivity gradient mechanism. There-
fore, in addition to the transition to detonation which is important for
the DDT process, another crucial issue is the formation of capable hot-
spots in the process. For DDT in ducts, deflagration is initially initiated
by a weak ignition source. Owing to the intrinsic instability of the flame,
e.g., Darrieus–Landau instability [247], thermal-diffusive instability
[248], or instability induced by the confinement of the geometry, e.g.,
K–H instabilities and R–T instabilities [242], the flame transitions to a
turbulent flame with the increasing rate of molecular transport;
furthermore the area of flame front significantly increases, ultimately
leading to flame acceleration. The flame speed can reach 600–1000 m/s
in sufficiently long tubes for certain mixtures under ambient conditions.
A system of shock waves ahead of the flame is generated by the flame
acceleration, which compresses the unburnt mixture to a high reactive
state. The flame speed must reach the sound speed in the combustion
products for transition to detonation to occur in general. The hotspots
inducing such a transition can be fostered in the regions between the
flame and shock waves in different ways, including shock reflection and
focusing, shock–flame interaction, and flame–flame interaction.

and the chemical reaction could be accelerated in the flame–shock
interaction process [252]. In a series of simulations investigating the
shock-flame interactions [157,253], it was brought to attention that the
turbulent flame was caused by the R-M instability generated pressure
fluctuations, which in turn facilitated the formation of hotspots in the
unburned region. In addition, as the shock propagated, a boundary layer
that grew with time was left behind the shock. The interplay between
the boundary layer and reflected shock generated a bifurcated shock
structure. Consequently, the presence of the bifurcated structure resul-
ted in the generation of a Mach stem and the creation of hotspots [156,
254]. Further studies [255,256] showed that based on the severity of the
shock, the shock–flame interaction could induce various combustion
phenomena, including no DDT, DDT inside the flame brush, and DDT
outside the flame brush.

In addition to the shock wave, hotspots could be formed by flame-
–flame interactions themselves. Oran et al. [241] numerically observed
that a spontaneous ignition wave could be initiated at the merging point
when two elongated flames approached each other to form a layer of
unburned material with its thickness comparable to that of the flame.
The propagation of a spontaneous wave in the unburned layer produced
a shock wave, which entered both the unburned and burned mixtures.
The shock wave in the burned mixture propagated faster and moved
ahead of the spontaneous wave, changing the reactivity gradient of the
unreacted contact layer. In addition, if the flame surfaces were not
perfectly parallel to each other, a reactivity gradient would also form
along the unburned contact layer owing to the non-uniform heat transfer
from the reaction zone. An appropriate gradient distribution would lead
to the spontaneous wave to detonation transition.

6.1.1.2. End-gas autoignition and detonation development. As mentioned
before, end-gas autoignition and detonation development under engine
conditions can also be divided into two stages: the first is the piston
compression and primary flame propagation, which continually pro-
motes the mixture reactivity and creates conditions for hotspot forma-
tion in the end-gas region, as we have called autoignition occurrence;
the second is the development of different autoignition propagation
modes. In the second stage, it shares the same gradient mechanism for
the detonation formation with DDT in ducts. In the first stage, the causes
for hotspot formation under engine conditions are partly similar to that
in the DDT process in ducts; however, they also have uniqueness
determined by the engine operation conditions. Details are as follows.
Under engine conditions, the pressure/shock wave reflection is still a
major cause for hotspot formation as has been discussed in Section 3.1.
The pressure wave can originate from the propagation of the primary
flame, autoignition of another hotspot [51], or simply a spark-like
causes a higher
ignition [33]. The

reflected pressure wave

The intersection is their second stages, i.e., detonation initiation, which share
the same mechanism, i.e., reactivity gradient mechanism. The difference be-
tween them is their first stage, i.e., hotspot formation/autoignition occurrence.
Although some causes for hotspot formation are identical in both processes, e.
g., shock wave reflection, more causes are different in the process of detonation
in engines owing to its operating conditions.

initiated directly by the shock wave reflecting off a wall if it is suffi-
ciently strong. As mentioned before, two ignition regimes, namely weak
and strong ignitions are observed in a shock tube system when a shock
wave propagates into a homogenous mixture. As the incidental and re-
flected shock waves in succession compress the mixture, it is at the edge
of an ignition/explosion. However, idealized reactivity homogeneity is
difficult to obtain in a real system owing to the presence of small fluc-
tuations in density, temperature, and concentration. In this case, the
autoignition time and location can be significantly influenced by these
small fluctuations. Therefore, the hotspots are formed as a result of the
combination of these small fluctuations and highly reactive mixture
created by shock wave reflection. The impact of shock wave reflection
can be further enhanced by using a converged or concave wall, which
can produce shock focusing [34,249,250]. Xiao and Oran [34] demon-
strated two diverse developments of shock focusing. For a stronger
shock, the focusing could trigger a direct detonation initiation when the
time scale is sufficiently small, while weaker shocks would induce a
delayed transition to detonation through hotspot autoignition.

Shock–flame interaction is another important method to cause a
transition to detonation. It includes complex instabilities and mixing. A
typical configuration for this interaction, wherein a shock interacts with
an initially laminar flame bubble and then reflected at the end wall has
been extensively
and numerically
investigated experimentally
[154–156,251]. The flame front could be distorted by the incident shock

temperature in the wall region when it is reflected from the wall, which
can lead to a larger concentration of reactive radical. It can be further
accumulated with repeated reflections of the wave, creating the hotspots
near the wall [9].

In addition to shock reflection, hotspot formation under engine
conditions also originates from the inhomogeneity brought in by the
physical process in the IC engines, including spray mixing [257],
entrainment of oil from the cylinder wall [258], non-uniform tempera-
ture distribution through the combustion chamber [215], and residual
exhaust gas from the previous cycle. As has been discussed in Section 4,
for the fuels with an NTC effect, the autoignition can be initiated along a
cold-spot [193] as well. As an effective way to improve the combustion
rate under engine conditions, turbulence also has a significant influence
on the formation of hotspots. As discussed before, autoignition spots
could originate and evolve at vortex cores, where the strain rate or scalar
dissipation was low [259]. In addition, the turbulent mixing between
burned gas
local
thermal-stratified regions [137]. All these processes contribute to the
uniqueness of end-gas autoignition and detonation development under
engine conditions, which distinguishes it from the DDT process in ducts.
The interactions among these factors further complicate the entire
combustion process. Furthermore, the onset of autoignition is also
determined by the competition between the main flame propagation and
reactivity of the end-gas as has been discussed in Section 3.2. The sim-
ilarity and uniqueness of detonation in engines and DDT in ducts are
summarized in Fig. 41.

6.1.2. Stochasticity of development to detonation

It is worth noting that super-knock usually takes place stochastically
in practical SI engines. Robert et al. [10] pointed out that the traditional
method of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) encounters the
challenge of the occasional feature of super-knock cycles, and they
conducted a high-resolution LES of 15 engine cycles to capture the
transition of normal combustion to detonation. It is usually considered
that the stochasticity of super knock is mostly related to the stochastic
pre-ignition occurrence. Therefore, the practical factors including the
lubricant oil, fuel droplet, deposits, soot, that can contribute to the
pre-ignition, have been investigated in the literature, and several re-
views about this [2,12] have been conducted. Here, we try to explain the
stochasticity of knocking combustion from the perspective of end-gas
autoignition and detonation development. That is to say, even though
without stochasticity of pre-ignition, end-gas autoignition and detona-
tion development themselves can be stochastic owing to the effects of
some stochastic factors, such as turbulent flow and variations in tem-
perature, pressure and mixture homogeneity, consequently leading to
the stochasticity of knocking combustion. The stochasticity of end-gas
autoignition and detonation development can be understood from two
aspects: one is the stochasticity of autoignition occurrence; the other is
stochasticity of autoignition propagation, especially the stochasticity of
detonation development. These two aspects are discussed in detail as
follows.

Recalling the discussions on fuel type and diluent gas conducted in
CVCC-TJU in Section 5, it was pointed that as oxygen concentration
increased, normal combustion to end-gas autoignition transition
occurred, and a critical oxygen concentration was used to demarcate the
two combustion modes. Fig. 42 detailedly shows the occurrence prob-
ability of end-gas autoignition under different oxygen concentrations for
H2-O2-N2 mixture and CH4-O2-N2 mixture. The critical oxygen concen-
trations of 25 % and 56 % can be obtained for H2-O2-N2 mixture and
CH4-O2-N2 mixture, respectively. It can be seen that end-gas auto-
ignition does not always take place at the critical oxygen concentration
or slightly larger than it, that we called the stochasticity of autoignition
occurrence. In Section 3.1.1, a stage called “critical and sensitive stage”
was proposed in the process of flame-pressure wave interaction induced
end-gas autoignition. The “critical and sensitive stage” means end-gas
autoignition is sensitive to slight disturbance in the stage; the critical

36

oxygen concentration here also has similar meaning. Increasing oxygen
concentration should be a promoting effect on end-gas autoignition,
whereas the effects of slight disturbance arising from temperature,
pressure, flow motion, etc., can be either a promoting or inhibiting effect
on end-gas autoignition, e.g., increased or decreased initial temperature
owing to the uncertainty of experimental measurements. The competi-
tion between the effects of oxygen concentration and slight disturbance
decides the end-gas autoignition occurrence. Specifically, at the critical
oxygen concentration, the promoting effect of oxygen concentration
could be equivalent to that of slight disturbance, and thus end-gas
autoignition is easily affected by the uncertainty of slight disturbance,
leading to stochasticity. However, if the oxygen concentration is much
larger than the critical value, e.g., 27 % for H2-O2-N2 mixture and 60 %
for CH4-O2-N2, autoignition becomes inevitable, namely controlled,
because the inhibiting effect of slight disturbance cannot win the pro-
moting effect of increasing oxygen concentration.

Although end-gas autoignition can be controlled, but autoignition
propagation, especially detonation development is stochastic in terms of
the location and intensity of detonation. Gamezo et al. [260] pointed out
that small fluctuations in the thermal conditions have a significant
impact on the stochastic nature of DDT. They conducted simulations in
which they changed the initial ambient temperature with an interval of
0.01 K to estimate the stochastic DDT behavior. The results indicated
that detonation performs the random phenomenon as a result of sto-
chastic flow instabilities, turbulence, hotspot formation, slight differ-
ence in thermodynamic condition, etc. Meanwhile, the stochasticity of
detonation initiation location and intensity also leads to the random
behaviors of the measured pressure and pressure oscillation which may
strongly depend on the arrangement of pressure sensors [70,219,261,
262]. This can be verified by the knock intensity show in Fig. 42, as well
as in Figs. 35(a) and Fig. 37. It can be seen that the knock intensity
spreads a broad range in these end-gas autoignition cases under the
same oxygen concentration.

6.2. Inspirations from fundamental physicochemical factors to
engineering technologies

End-gas autoignition especially with detonation combustion in
confined space involves the complex physical and chemical phenomena,
including premixed flame dynamics, fluid dynamics, flame-pressure
wave or shock wave interactions, hotspot autoignition, etc., which is
generally considered as the origin of knock and super-knock occurrences
in SI engine. Based on the understanding of the fundamental theory, it is
helpful to an adoption of the effective knock and super knock mitigation
strategies, consequently allowing the automotive industry to continue
the SI engines and expand to the engines using carbon-free fuels, such as
hydrogen or e-fuels. Some of the representative issues of suppressing
knocking combustion, inspired by the understanding of physicochemical
factors affecting end-gas auto-ignition and detonation discussed in the
above sections, are discussed briefly here.

6.2.1. Application of turbulent jet ignition in mitigating knock

As discussed in Section 3, improving flame speed could inhibit end-
gas autoignition under engine conditions. It is well documented that pre-
chamber turbulent jet ignition (TJI) can solve the ignition issue of lean
combustion in real engines, which also has the potential ability to
mitigate the knock occurrence due to high-velocity flame propagation
[263,264]. The basic reason for this behavior is that the onset of fast jet
flame reaching the end-gas region is earlier than that of the knocking
occurrence. However, it is worth noting that recent works based on
kerosene fuel used in an SI engine have shown that at the same spark
timing, the pre-chamber jet ignition can produce more intense pressure
oscillations compared to the dual spark plug ignition, which is caused by
a rapid increase of temperature and pressure in the cylinder [265]. Thus,
when a pre-chamber TJI is used in engines, the spark timing should be
retarded to avoid the knock occurrence. Some relevant fundamental

L. Zhou et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101217

studies [266,267] conduced in an optical CVCC found that the fast
turbulent jet flame could generate a compression wave, or even a shock
wave for the pre-chamber fueled with hydrogen fuel, which finally
causes a strong pressure oscillation. The enhancement or suppression of
knock strongly depends on the competition between the flame propa-
gation velocity and end-gas autoignition delay time, and involves pa-
rameters, such as the chamber size, pre-chamber configuration,
turbulent jet flame, fuel types in the pre-chamber and main combustion
chamber, and wall temperature.

6.2.2. Suppressing the transition from a hotspot to detonation wave

Detonation is the most destructive propagation mode during
knocking combustion; however, its formation needs two rigorous re-
quirements be met: first, the speed of the spontaneous wave approaches
the local sound speed; second, sufficient energy is fed into the acoustic
wave. Considering these two requirements, two types of measures can be
taken for the suppression of detonation initiation. One is to enhance the
end-gas inhomogeneity. In most scenarios of knock and super-knock
occurrence, a strong pressure oscillation is an essential feature, which
implies that thermal explosion or detonation development takes place in
the end-gas region, and the end gas is weakly inhomogeneous under
these conditions. Therefore, detonation inhibition may be achieved by
actively enhancing the reactivity inhomogeneity of the end gas. For
example, Takahashi et al. [54] utilized dielectric barrier discharge
(DBD) to reform fuel–air premixtures in the end gas, and suggested that
the formation of reactivity gradient enhanced by DBD generated species
may suppress the strong pressure wave. The other is to reduce the energy
feed into the acoustic wave, which could be realized in two ways. One
method is to extend the excitation time of the mixture, which can be
most effectively achieved by decreasing the equivalence ratio of the
mixture. However, a lower equivalence ratio also leads to a reduction in
the combustion rate. Hence, this method needs to be adopted in com-
bination with other measures that can accelerate combustion, such as
turbulent jet ignition. Another method is to shorten the space for
spontaneous wave propagation. According to the discussions in Section
4.3, high turbulence intensity, i.e., large velocity fluctuations, with a
small integral length scale reduces the super knock intensity as a result
of hotspot breakup. However, it is difficult to organize such a turbulent
field in practice. Alternatively, reducing the unburnt mixture fraction to
the maximal extent possible at the instant of autoignition may be more
easily realized and can be equally effective [26].

6.2.3. Application of collaborative optimization method of energy density
and reactivity in mitigating knock

As discussed in Section 5, the combustion modes in end-gas region of
confined space are strongly related to the energy density and reactivity
of mixture. At higher energy density, knocking combustion is more
likely to occur. In addition, the higher reactivity of mixture also leads to
the higher propensity of knocking combustion. This means that by the
collaborative optimization of the energy density and reactivity of
mixture through changing the initial conditions and controlling com-
bustion process in the context of practical engines, the occurrence of
knocking combustion can be suppressed to some extent. It should be
noted that the main aim of collaborative optimization is to suppress
knock while improving engine efficiency.

The energy density can be uniformed by quantifying the impact
weights of macro-operational parameters such as intake temperature,
pressure, and equivalence ratio. Furthermore, the energy density also
can be controlled in practical engine operation by advanced variable
compression ratio [268,269], variable supercharging technology [270]
as well as boosted Atkinson/Miller cycle [271] to achieve the suitable
thermodynamic conditions for knocking-free combustion with high ef-
ficiency and low emissions at a wide range of engine operations.

For the reactivity of mixture, the low-temperature combustion with
EGR or cooled EGR [272], lean-combustion or ultra-lean-combustion
[273], multi-injection strategy for mixture stratification [271], high

octane number fuels [228,274], water injection [275], high cooling
potential fuels (hydrous Ethanol) and dilution gases [276], and so on can
be used. Most suppressing methods are provided to achieve both the
knock suppression and improvement of engine performance by lowering
the reactivity of mixture and increasing the energy density especially the
cylinder pressure and intake charge. For instance, the Miller cycle pro-
vides a good anti-knock performance because of its low in-cylinder
temperature induced by the lower effective compression ratio, which
decreases the chemical reactivity and prolongs the IDT in end-gas re-
gion. However, Miller cycle has a poor dynamic output. To solve this
issue, the intake boost pressure was employed to improve both the
thermal efficiency and torque of the engine, and knock resistance.
Further coupling with the split injection, the engine torque is higher by
over 10 % and its knock percentage is lower by more than 35 %
compared to the baseline case [271]. Similarly, cooled EGR can both
lower the reactivity of mixture and energy density compared to the in-
ternal EGR to suppress the knock occurrence, but the thermal efficiency
will be weakened. To this end, combing the effects of boosting or
increased compression ratio can improve the thermal efficiency [277].

6.3. Future prospects

Throughout this review significant contributions made in the past
decades have been discussed for an in-depth understanding of the
mechanism of end-gas autoignition and hotspot transition to detonation.
However, several interesting and incompletely understood topics still
exist, which warrant further research; these are enumerated below.

6.3.1. Fundamental research

1) High-fidelity 3D numerical simulations are to be conducted. Owing
to the limitations of 2D simulation, only a cross-section along one
direction of the cylinder can be modeled. Although the existing
conclusions, such as pressure wave reflection-induced autoignition,
relationship between flame acceleration and combustion mode
transition, effects of turbulence on hotspot detonability, etc., are
expected to be qualitatively the same in 3D conditions, both turbu-
lence and detonation wave have an inherently multi-dimensional
characteristics, and the pressure wave structures as well as hotspot
interactions will become more complicated; therefore, the effects of
additional dimensions need to be evaluated in future work.

2) A quantitative regime diagram incorporating all essential influencing
factors and able to completely describing autoignition propagation
modes is expected to be proposed. Although a few valuable methods
have been proposed to extend the reactivity gradient theory to multi-
dimensional conditions, it seems that Bradley’s diagram itself fails to
completely explain the effects of fuel type and energy density on
autoignition propagation modes. As discussed in Section 5, the limits
of detonation peninsula are not constant but depend on the fuel type
and initial temperature, etc. In addition, under practical conditions,
inhomogeneity frequently is coupled with turbulence, it is worth-
while to further understand the effects of turbulence-inhomogeneity
interaction, especially the characteristic quantities of turbulence,
such as characteristic length scales, turbulent velocity fluctuation, on
autoignition propagation modes. The ignition regimes proposed by
Grogan et al. [136] as discussed in Section 2.2.1 have considered
turbulence, but it does not include the effects of hotspot length scale
on detonation. In short, a quantitative regime diagram able to
completely describing autoignition propagation modes should at
least take into consideration (ξ, ε), fuel type, energy density, and
turbulence simultaneously.

3) IC engines will still play an important role in mobility in the fore-
seeable future, and using carbon-free fuels such as hydrogen or po-
tential greenhouse gas (GHG) neutral fuels aimed at low/zero-carbon
and high-efficient combustion [278]. Therefore, insights into the
mechanism of end-gas autoignition and detonation occurrence are

37

L. Zhou et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101217

useful to develop fuels to avoid undesired knock or super-knocking
combustion. Hydrogen engines are becoming an attractive option,
as they are carbon-free. However, in hydrogen engines, pressure
oscillations without end-gas autoignition may result in knock at high
loads. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the knock phenomenon in
hydrogen engines should be obtained through future research.
Furthermore, in the future, the engine design aims to high knock
resistance and high thermal efficiency by utilizing highly
knock-resistant potential GHG neutral synthetic fuels [279], such as
methanol (MeOH), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and methyl formate
(MeFo), and ammonia. However, as the engine compression ratio
and boosted pressure are further increased, knocking combustion has
the potential risk to affect the engine efficiency like in the traditional
gasoline engines. The phenomena of the end-gas auto-ignition and
detonation for these fuels are still necessary to study.

6.3.2. Engineering technologies

1) If the quantitative regime diagram in the last subsection could be
obtained, another difficulty exists that the detailed information
about the inhomogeneous field, as the input of the diagram, e.g.,
temperature and composition distributions, is troublesome to be
obtained in engine experiments. The numerical simulations, e.g.,
LES, of engine operation could provide the information; however,
another difficulty arises because the engine operation condition is
variable, and the computational cost can be very huge if every
operation condition is simulated. A possible way to solve the two
problems is with the help of machine learning (ML) [280,281]. The
inhomogeneous field in engine chamber can be determined by the
engine geometry parameters, e.g., bore, stroke, compression ratio,
tumble ratio, and the engine operation parameters, e.g., intake
temperature and pressure, cooling, fuel-injection quantity, engine
speeds, torque; using the results of numerical simulations as samples
to train the ML model could build a mapping between the engine
operation condition and the information of the inhomogeneous field
corresponding to the condition. If the mapping model can be uni-
versal, the information of the inhomogeneous field can be obtained
once the engine operation condition is given; then the detonation
propensity and even the location most likely to initiate detonation
can be predicted by the above quantitative regime diagram, which
can guide the further optimization engine design.

2) The thermal efficiency of engine can be directly increased by
improving the compression ratio; however, it will result in the high
peak pressure and temperature and subsequently cause easily knock
occurrence, even using some high octane number fuels. Thus, an
alternative way to increase thermal efficiency with the engine
operating at high CR condition is to run the engine with a lean-
combustion or ultra-lean combustion as mentioned in the last sub-
section. The lean-combustion can effectively lower the chemical
reactivity to suppress end-gas autoignition. Lean fuel-air mixture can
increase the specific heat ratio and reduce the combustion temper-
ature, and meanwhile the heat loss also can be additionally reduced.
One of main issues is how to choose the suitable exhaust gas after-
treatment. Another issue is how to achieve stable ignition for the
ultra-lean combustion. Apart from air dilution, EGR dilution is still a
very effective methodology to suppress the knock and lower the NOx
emission. Similarly, it also meets the challenges of dilution tolerance
of the engine, which will affect the combustion stability. To this end,
enhancing the ignition ability such as the pre-chamber TJI [282] and
advanced corona ignition system (ACIS) [279] or incorporating
higher reactivity compounds in to the EGR stream such as the
dedicated-EGR method [283,284] have the potential ability to solve
the combustion instability issue. However, these methods are still
immature and not commonly used in engines today.

3) Finally, although we always focus on how to suppress the end-gas
autoignition, it is noteworthy that end-gas autoignition can be

harnessed to improve the engine power. This idea is similar to SACI
or controlled autoignition. For instance, the carbon-free fuel NH3
with a high autoignition temperature and low laminar flame speed is
more suitable for applications in SACI or jet induced CI (JICI) in SI
engines [285]. To further utilize the relationship between knock
intensity and BMF, the premixed mixture ignition in the end-gas
region (PREMIER) combustion was proposed, whose objective is to
utilize the heat release of end-gas autoignition to increase the engine
efficiency and meanwhile to avoid pressure oscillation induced by
end-gas autoignition by taking various measures [57]. However, all
these methods are not mature and needs further investigations.

7. Conclusions

Knock is considered to originate from end-gas autoignition, while
super-knock is attributed to detonation development in the cylinder. The
review has attempted to answer the fundamental questions about how
end-gas autoignition occurs and propagates in confined spaces. Several
pivotal physicochemical factors related to the questions are compre-
hensively investigated, including flame propagation, pressure wave,
inhomogeneity, turbulence, chemical reactivity and thermodynamic
conditions. Important conclusions from the present review are summa-
rized as follows:

Basic theories: Both end-gas autoignition occurrence and propaga-
tion affect the knock intensity, for which two theoretical models can
provide support. One is Livengood-Wu integral which gives a prediction
for the autoignition time of end gas when the evolution of its thermo-
dynamic condition is known. With some improvements, Livengood-Wu
integral also provides a good prediction accuracy for NTC behavior and
two-stage ignition. However, the accuracy of L-W integral, especially
when used in the experimental study of engine combustion, is highly
sensitive to the uncertainty of the input parameters which can be
influenced by the accuracies of chemistry mechanism, temperature and
pressure measurements, etc. The other is reactivity gradient theory,
which quantitatively describes different propagation modes of reaction
front initiated by hotspots. Detonation development from a hotspot
needs two requirements: the first is the coupling between sound wave
and spontaneous wave, and the second is sufficient energy release is fed
into the pressure wave. Furthermore, the original 1D gradient theory can
be extended to 2D and even 3D conditions through statistical method.
Pressure wave-flame interactions:The onset of knock and super-
knock causes the combustion to deteriorate and even damage the en-
gine irreversibly. A crucial index to measure the intensity of knock is the
amplitude of pressure oscillation, which reflects the intensity of the
pressure wave/shock wave generated by autoignition in nature. The
flame-pressure interaction induced end-gas autoignition and detonation
can be divided into three processes. In the process of reactivity increase,
pressure waves are generated by flame expansion and acceleration or
pre-ignition. The flame-pressure wave interactions lead to flame insta-
bility and oscillations in combustion rate, which affects the pressure
waves development in turn. The repeated reflections at the wall of these
pressure waves lead to larger reactive radical accumulation and thus
create favorable conditions for autoignition occurrence adjacent to the
wall. In the process of critical and sensitive state, the end-gas can be very
sensitive to slight disturbance which can easily affects autoignition
timing and location. In the process of coupling and detonation, high-
pressure zone was built up owing to the rapid heat release form the
local autoignition, which coupled with the reaction front, finally
evolving into a detonation whose propagation leads to violent pressure
oscillation in the cylinder. When the pressure wave generated by the
main flame is weak, increasing flame speed/combustion rate has the
potential to suppress end-gas autoignition. However, if a strong pressure
wave can be generated by flame acceleration, end-gas autoignition can
be promoted by strong flame acceleration and can even be rendered
inevitable when the mixture temperature is extremely high regardless of
the flame speed. Therefore, the effect of flame speed on knock intensity

38

L. Zhou et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101217

is non-monotonic. Similarly, the knock intensity does not strongly
depend on BMF at autoignition onset; it is also affected by localized
autoignition propagation mode, but there is no doubt that a small BMF
at autoignition onset benefits thermal explosion and even detonation
development, resulting in possibly stronger pressure oscillations.
Furthermore, when piston motion is considered, the situation becomes
more complicated.

Inhomogeneity and its interaction with turbulence: The propa-
gation modes of end-gas autoignition, i.e., deflagration, detonation, and
thermal explosion, directly determine the magnitude of the pressure
oscillation, wherein detonation is the most destructive combustion
mode. Detonation can be initiated successfully when a suitable reac-
tivity gradient forms, which can be induced by the inhomogeneity of
temperature, composition concentration, additive, etc. Additionally,
fuels with NTC effects can induce autoignition at a coldspot. However,
an NTC is not a necessary condition for knock occurrence. Knock and
super knock can be observed for these fuels without the NTC effects
under similar engine conditions. The autoignition propagation within a
hotspot can be complicated by multi-stage ignition, since the pressure/
shock waves could be produced by heat release from all the three igni-
tion stages, namely LTI, ITI, HTI. A larger temperature gradient or/and
concentration gradient is required for detonation development with LTC
than without LTC if other conditions are the same. As to multi-
dimensional
inhomogeneity, an inhomogeneous field with a small
characteristic length scale, and an inhomogeneous field with a large
characteristic length scale but coupled with the turbulence with small
characteristic length scale and sufficiently large turbulent velocity
fluctuations, can both weaken detonation propensity. It is associated
with the size of the hotspot; a large space for autoignition propagation
can promote the detonation formation. Furthermore, the interactions
between adjacent hotspots enhance the detonation development. With
the consideration of wall heat transfer, turbulence-cold wall interactions
could increase the thermal inhomogeneity in the cylinder, since turbu-
lence tends to entrain more gas in the cold thermal boundary on the
cylinder wall to the core region. Detonation propagation becomes un-
stable when the mixture is lean, and it can degenerate into decoupled
shock wave and reaction front when it encountered the cold flow.

Chemical reactivity and thermodynamic conditions: The chem-
ical reactivity and thermodynamic conditions can affect both auto-
ignition occurrence and autoignition propagation. Specifically, the
effects of fuel type on end-gas autoignition can be attributed to the
combined effects of the flame propagation characteristic of fuel, e.g.,
laminar burning velocity, and autoignition characteristic of fuel, i.e.,
IDT, while the effects of diluent gas on end-gas autoignition can be
attributed to the combined effects of the flame propagation character-
istic of the diluted mixture and thermal effect, i.e., the diluent gas with a
large specific heat capacity can result in a low end-gas temperature, and
thus prolongs the IDT of end gas. In addition, diluent gas can also reduce
the detonation stability and propagation, lead to the detonation deficit,
and thus decrease the knock intensity. Based on these reasons, CO2 ex-
presses best inhibiting effects on end-gas autoignition and detonation
development. In addition, increasing the initial temperature can pro-
mote end-gas autoignition since it directly shortens the IDT of end gas, a
higher initial mixture temperature promotes the end-gas to flame-front
autoignition transition; this transition can also be realized by the joint
effects of increasing chemical reactivity and flame speed. Although
increasing initial temperature directly promotes end-gas autoignition
occurrence in terms of advancing autoignition timing, it does not mean
that an increase in temperature always enhance the knock intensity,
which can be attributed to energy density. A larger energy density, i.e., a
higher pressure and/or lower temperature could facilitate the detona-
tion formation, resulting in a violent knocking combustion. However,
the effects of fuel type and energy density on autoignition propagation
may not be completely explained by Bradley’s diagram, and should be
considered separately.

Characteristics of end-gas autoignition and detonation in IC

engines: detonation in engines has similarity and uniqueness compared
with DDT in ducts. The similarity lies in that they share the same
mechanism, i.e., the reactivity gradient mechanism, for detonation
initiation from a hotspot. The uniqueness lies in that the ways to hotspot
formation in IC engines can really depend on the engine operation
condition and be different from detonation in ducts. In addition, end-gas
autoignition and detonation development in IC engines also expresses
stochasticity, which can be understood from two aspects: one is the
stochasticity of autoignition occurrence; the other is stochasticity of
autoignition propagation, especially the stochasticity of detonation
development. Specifically, at a critical state, autoignition occurrence
can be uncertainty, which is attributed to the competition between the
effects of primary promoting factor and slight disturbance. Detonation
development can be stochastic in terms of the location and intensity of
detonation owing to stochastic flow instabilities, turbulence, hotspot
formation, slight difference in thermodynamic condition, etc.

Inspirations and prospects: Several inspirations can be obtained
from these fundamental studies for engineering application in sup-
pressing knocking combustion, including turbulent jet ignition, con-
trolling inhomogeneity, and collaborative optimization method of
energy density and reactivity. In the future, it is expected more accurate
quantitative method can be developed to describe the relationship be-
tween field factors,
including turbulence and inhomogeneity, and
autoignition propagation mode. With the improvement of computa-
tional power, it is also expected high-resolution 3D can be conducted to
understand the detail combustion process of end-gas autoignition
considering the multi-dimensional nature of turbulence and detonation
wave. In addition, end-gas autoignition for GHG neutral fuels should be
focused. For the specific engineering technologies, the research should
further pay attention to quantitative regime diagram with incorporating
engine operation parameters, lean combustion, and reasonable utiliza-
tion of end-gas autoignition.
