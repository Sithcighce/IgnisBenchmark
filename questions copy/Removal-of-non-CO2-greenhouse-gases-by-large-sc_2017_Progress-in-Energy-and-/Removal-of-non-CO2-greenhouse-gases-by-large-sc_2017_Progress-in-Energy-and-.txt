Large-scale atmospheric removal of greenhouse gases (GHGs) including methane, nitrous oxide and ozone-
depleting halocarbons could reduce global warming more quickly than atmospheric removal of CO2. Photo-
catalysis of methane oxidizes it to CO2, effectively reducing its global warming potential (GWP) by at least
90%. Nitrous oxide can be reduced to nitrogen and oxygen by photocatalysis; meanwhile halocarbons can
be mineralized by red-ox photocatalytic reactions to acid halides and CO2. Photocatalysis avoids the need
for capture and sequestration of these atmospheric components. Here review an unusual hybrid device
combining photocatalysis with carbon-free electricity with no-intermittency based on the solar updraft
chimney. Then we review experimental evidence regarding photocatalytic transformations of non-CO2
GHGs. We propose to combine TiO2-photocatalysis with solar chimney power plants (SCPPs) to cleanse the
atmosphere of non-CO2 GHGs. Worldwide installation of 50,000 SCPPs, each of capacity 200 MW, would
generate a cumulative 34 PWh of renewable electricity by 2050, taking into account construction time.
These SCPPs equipped with photocatalyst would process 1 atmospheric volume each 14(cid:1)16 years, reducing
or stopping the atmospheric growth rate of the non-CO2 GHGs and progressively reducing their atmo-
spheric concentrations. Removal of methane, as compared to other GHGs, has enhanced efficacy in reducing
radiative forcing because it liberates more °OH radicals to accelerate the cleaning of the troposphere. The
overall reduction in non-CO2 GHG concentration would help to limit global temperature rise. By physically
linking greenhouse gas removal to renewable electricity generation, the hybrid concept would avoid the
moral hazard associated with most other climate engineering proposals.

1. Introduction

1.1. The need for hybrid renewable energy and greenhouse gas
reduction technologies

PEven if humans stop combusting fossil fuels and discharging CO2
into the atmosphere, the average global temperature of the Earth
will continue to increase for the rest of the century (cid:1)for several rea-
sons. Firstly, the long lifetime of CO2 (estimated in the 100(cid:1)300 year
range [1]) means that the excess atmospheric stocks (515 Gt Carbon)
would continue to drive radiative forcing and global warming for
many decades [2]. Secondly, even if atmospheric concentrations
were to decrease, CO2 would outgas from the oceans and offset this
decrease, because of the dynamic equilibrium between the CO2 in
2¡ dissolved in
the atmosphere and the (bi)carbonates HCO3
the oceans [3].

¡/CO3

PThirdly, there is the contribution of other GHGs, besides CO2,
which together account for about 34% of radiative forcing [4]. Even if
all excess anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 were removed, radiative
forcing would only be reduced by half [5].

PThe insufficiency of mitigation measures based just on fossil fuel
replacement has prompted research in carbon capture and seques-
tration (CCS), greenhouse gas removal (GHGR), and solar radiation
management (also called solar reflection methods: SRM). But each of
these approaches suffers drawbacks. CCS [6,7] may restrict release of
CO2 from stationary fossil-fuel power plants, but not from vehicles.
It also carries significant water and energy penalties and a number
of environmental risks associated with transport and storage of the
CO2 [7,8].

PIn order to stabilize the Earth surface temperature alternative pro-
cesses are needed to decrease the level of atmospheric GHGs. Of the
over 100 climate modeling simulations consistent with the Paris
Agreement goals, as analyzed by the IPCC scientists, 87% involve net-
negative emissions [9] by the end of the century: this can only be
accomplished through the large-scale deployment of GHGR solutions.
PAccording to the United Nations Environment Program [10], as
shown in Fig. 1, the CO2 emissions will have to be stopped by mid-
century and by the second half of the century, GHGs will have to be
removed from the atmosphere and among them non-CO2 GHGs
which have a significant contribution to the global anthropogenic
radiative forcing (nearly 1/3rd).

PAmong GHGR technologies, those most frequently discussed tar-
technologies include

get CO2. Carbon dioxide removal

(CDR)

Pafforestation, reforestation, biochar [11,12], bioenergy with carbon
capture and sequestration (BECCS)
[13,14], direct air capture
(removing the CO2 from ambient air rather than from a smoke stack)
[15], accelerated mineral weathering [16], ocean iron fertilization
and several others [17]. Each incurs significant penalties with regard
to land, energy and water usage [18]. BECCS offers the benefit of net
energy production, but requires very large land usage which would
impact on world food production [19].

PSRM technologies include atmospheric aerosol injection using
sulphur dioxide or other agents to induce negative radiative forcing
by reflecting back to space incoming sunlight. Such interventions
raise perplexing issues of international governance and security,
prompting discussions about militarization, vulnerability to sabo-
tage, and the risks of sudden termination causing catastrophic
warming should the technology fail for any reason [20]. Over-reli-
ance on SRM and CDR generally, and fear of resulting complacency
as regards emissions reduction, has been referred to as moral hazard
in debates about both these climate engineering measures.

PThe moral hazard can be avoided, however, if GHGR is physically
linked to emissions reduction, thus making sure that the former
does not neglect the latter. While BECCS achieves such linkage,
another approach so far less discussed and evaluated is to hybridize
Solar Chimney Power Plants (SCPPs) with Photocatalytic Reactors
(PCRs) (cid:1) see Fig. 2 and chapter 2. The idea of hybrid SCPP-PCR was
introduced at the recent Oxford (UK) GHGR conference [21] and ear-
lier at a SCPP conference in Bochum (DE) [22]. Like BECCS, SCPP-PCR
would provide renewable electricity while removing GHGs; but

Fig. 2. Hybrid SCPP-PCR for renewable electricity generation and greenhouse gas removal (reproduced from [21]).

Pinstead of removing CO2 it would remove other GHGs including
methane, nitrous oxide and halocarbons.

PThe SCPP is an established concept that generates electricity in a
solar updraft tower incorporating axial-flow turbines [23]. Hot air is
supplied to the tower by a large solar air heater (solar collector) sim-
ilar to a horticultural greenhouse (GH). The function of a PCR can be
incorporated in the SCPP by coating its collector with a photocata-
lyst, such as TiO2, which is able to transform non-CO2 GHGs into less
harmful products.

1.2. Why focus on removing non-CO2 greenhouse gases?

PThough CO2 currently contributes the largest part (65%) to radia-
tive forcing, with CH4 in second place at 17%, reduction of CH4 may
have a disproportionately large effect in arresting future global
warming. This is because of the role of methane in tropospheric
ozone chemistry. Methane reduces the oxidizing capacity of the
atmosphere when reacting with hydroxyl radicals (°OH) which pro-
duces tropospheric ozone, a harmful compound for humans, live-
stock and plants. The chemical coupling between °OH and CH4 leads
to a significant amplification of an emission impact; that is, increas-
ing CH4 emissions decreases tropospheric °OH which in turn
increases the CH4 lifetime and therefore its burden.

PMoreover, the last report of IPCC revised upwards the estimates
of global warming potential (GWP) of CH4. Per kg, CH4 causes
28(cid:1)34 times more global warming than CO2 over a 100-year time
horizon according to the IPCC 5th report of 2013 [24]. This repre-
sents a significant increase over the earlier estimate of GWP100 D 25
in the 4th IPCC report of 2007. Furthermore, over a 20-year horizon,
the IPCC now attributes GWP20 D 86 to methane, bringing new
urgency to the control of CH4 levels. Photocatalysis would transform
CH4 into equimolar quantities of CO2 so comparisons should be
made on a molar basis (rather than per kg). Thus GWP values for
methane are effectively reduced by a factor of 2.75 leading to modi-
fied values in the range 10(cid:1)30 approximately. Even so, transforming
methane and other GHGs into CO2 is almost as good as removing
them altogether. For example, based on GWP D 28, transformation of
1 kg of methane into 2.75 kg of CO2 reduces its climate change effect
by 90%, and is equivalent to removal of 25.25 kg of CO2 from
the atmosphere. In summary, transforming atmospheric CH4 into
equimolar amounts of CO2, as discussed in this review, would have
a significant impact in fighting global warming.

PIt should be remembered that radiative forcing is conventionally
measured relative to 1750 baseline estimates of GHGs concentration.
As highlighted by Ruddiman [25], a reframing of timescales to span
back to about 6000 BCE, would lead to further upward estimate in
the radiative forcing of methane.

1.3. The need for this review

PThough CO2 reduction is more frequently the subject of scientific
study, some technological options for reducing non-CO2 emissions
have already been reviewed [26]. But few options have been pre-
sented for removal at global scale. By way of exception, Boucher [27]
considered molecular sieves, adsorption filters (zeolite minerals),
cryogenic separation and in-situ CH4 oxidation techniques (rather
than capture it) with enzymatic systems, methanotrophic bacteria
hosted in bio-rectors, bio-inspired catalytic oxidation in aqueous
phase and using precious metal-based catalysts. Boucher suggested
carefully assessing all suitable technologies for CH4 air capture
against their energetic cost and scalability. But none of the proposals
appeared energetically or economically suitable to be applied on a
large scale. Most of them would require an energy supply, which is
strong disincentive to their application, and none of them explicitly
addresses issues of implementation at the scale necessary to avert
disastrous climate change.

PStolaroff [28] found that any strategy to reduce significantly
atmospheric CH4 concentrations needs to process nearly 1/10 of the
atmosphere each year. According to Stolaroff, with catalytic aerosols
dispersed in the atmosphere this might be feasible; although a suit-
able aerosol material was not identified by this author.

PThough reduction of CO2 emissions will not alone suffice to stabi-
lize global warming, an overall reduction in concentrations of CO2
and other GHGs could limit global temperature rise to the ceiling of
1.5‒2 °C mandated at the recent COP 21 meeting in Paris [29]. This
makes a hybrid approach for renewable energy (avoiding CO2) and
removal of GHGs highly interesting as a potentially effective solution
and a negative emissions technology. Furthermore, the economics of
power generation could help pay for the GHGR. These advantages
are also a feature of BECCS, which has so far attracted much research
and review of literature [30(cid:1)32].

PIn contrast to BECCS, the hybrid SCPP-PCR concept has only been
subject to an academic review for N2O and halocarbons [33,34]. This
review aims to redress this situation and provide a sound literature

Pbackground for future research of this promising new concept, espe-
cially for CH4 removal. No SCPP-PCR has ever been built; therefore
the review must focus on the parent technologies of the PCR and
SCPP, of which examples have been built (though not yet of suffi-
cient scale), in order to draw inferences about the potential of the
hybrid concept.

PThe review is structured as follows. Section 2 covers the back-
ground of SCPPs; then Section 3 covers the types of photocatalysts
and reactors, their environmental and large scale applications, and
issues associated with lifetime of the catalysts. Section 4 discusses

oxide into nitrogen and oxygen according to the reaction scheme of

PIn Section 5, we discuss coupling of a PCR with the SCPP. The syn-
ergies between these two disruptive technologies are then listed
before the examination of the possibilities for night operation of the
non-CO2 GHGs removal process; and then a discussion (Section 5)
and concluding remarks are given.

2. Solar chimney power plants background

PThis section reviews work up till now on SCPPs, as this will be rel-
evant to their proposed coupling to photocatalytic reactors. It makes
special reference to the experimental plant operated in Spain in the
1980s and the following theoretical studies and design initiatives.

PThe rationale in combining SCPPs with PCR for non-CO2 GHGR is
as follows. First, we note that to be able to remove, transform, or
destroy significant amounts of non-CO2 GHGs (halocarbons, N2O and
CH4) from the earth's atmosphere in air, at ambient temperature and
ambient RH% several materials and conditions are required:

P(cid:3) efficient visible light photocatalysts able to transform non-CO2

GHGs;

P(cid:3) strong sunlight radiation during numerous hours to activate

very large surface areas of the photocatalysts;

P(cid:3) strong and continuous air fluxes to put in contact the photocata-
lysts under the sunlight and the polluted air containing CH4,
N2O, CFCs and HFCs.

PSecond, we note that a SCPP (Fig. 2) can bring all these conditions

together.

PA conventional SCPP is composed of 4 principal components [35]:

P(cid:3) a very large GH collector, for GH effect;
P(cid:3) a tall chimney for stack effect;
P(cid:3) a thermal energy storage layer to store the solar radiation for

night time operation;

P(cid:3) and several turbines to generate renewable electricity which is
carbon-free. By transforming sunlight radiation received under
several km2 of greenhouse (GH) collector (made of glass or plas-
tic) a SCPP produces sustainable decarbonized renewable energy.

PWhen linked with photocatalysis, the SCPP therefore becomes
a negative-emissions technology with power generation (whereas
CCS and DAC technologies consume energy).

PTypically, the area of the GH collector for a model SCPP of
200 MW is 38 km2 and the daily airflow passing through it is
17 km3 per day, SCPPs being located in regions receiving usually
>2200 kW m¡2 year¡1 of solar radiation [36]. SCPPs appear to be
good candidates for large scale GHGR as they can share several km2
of illuminated area to perform photocatalytic reactions in synergy.
The energy pay-back time of a SCPP is estimated to »2 years [37]
(compensation of the CO2 emissions due to the production of con-
struction materials and the construction of a structure reimbursed
by the CO2 emissions avoided by renewable energy production).

PThough SCPPs have hardly been studied for non-CO2 GHGR, there
are other studies for air cleaning that are worth noting. Recently
Cao, et al. [38] proposed a large-scale urban air remediation with a
solar chimneys equipped of filters inside as a cleaning system to
remove particulate matter thanks to the air flux it can provide. This
modified solar chimney is devoted to air purification and does not
produce electricity, as an average pressure drop of 500 Pa is used by
Cao in the numerical simulation, because the filter has to remove
small particles.

PSimilarly, direct CO2 capture from the atmosphere using alkali
resin solid sorbents has also been proposed [39], taking profit
from the very important air flux provided “almost for free” by SCPPs.

2.1. SCPP pilot plant at Manzanares, Spain

PIn 1982, a 50 kW SCPP prototype with collector radius 122 m and
chimney height 195 m was built in Spain by the German company
Schlaich Bergermann and Partners [40,41]. Key technical data and
design criteria of this pilot are shown in Table 1. The SCPP pilot
was fully tested and validated over seven years [23,35] attracting
worldwide attention.

PAdvocates of the technology have pointed to the following bene-
fits: (1) ease of collecting large amounts of solar radiation; (2) ther-
mal energy storage using cheap storage material which can realize
continuous and steady generation of electricity; (3) artificial strong
unidirectional upwind caused by the GH effect and the stack effect,
which avoid the application of complex controlling systems neces-
sarily used in free wind farms; (4) easily combing natural wind by
introducing the natural wind via the collector inlet; (5) technical
feasibility and cost-reduction possibilities by using ETFE for the col-
lector canopy [37] and self-standing fabric chimney to replace the
conventional concrete tower [42(cid:1)44].

PUnder the GH, the thermal inertia of the ground can be enhanced,
to store heat during the day and to release sensible heat at night,
allowing electricity production 24 h/day with no-intermittency [45].

2.2. Theoretical analysis of the SCPP

PA very comprehensive mathematical model to describe the GH
effect of a SCPP pilot based upon the thermal network theory was
firstly advanced by Pasumarthi and Sherif [46], where they consid-
ered: (1) the effect of single and double canopy to avoid excessive
thermal energy releasing to the ambience; (2) the effect of the
area of an energy storage layer on the overall performance of
SCPP. Later, the same group further studied the performance of a
backyard SCPP pilot [47,48]. The thermal network model for SCPP
was further developed by Bernardes et al. [49] to analyze the large
scale SCPP with the ambient pressure, temperature, and density
varying with altitude. To calculate the heat transfer characteristics
of the collector with a single channel and an energy storage sys-
tem, a 7 £ 7 matrix comprehensively considering the heat transfer
between the energy storage system, air flow, the canopy, and the
ambience is shown in Eq. (1), with the Latin and Greek symbols
as defined in [49]. In this equation, all the coefficients in the
matrix on the left side were confirmed according to the empirical
formula from classic textbook being verified at various working
conditions.

PEq. (2) is partial differential equation representing the transient
energy transfer and storage mechanism inside the energy storage
layer [50], where the solar radiation was regarded as an effective
heat source being imposed upon the ground surface with a thickness
of 0.2 mm [45,51]. The average efficiency of the collector is less
than 60% [41,46], as a result, in order to further improve the thermal
performance of the collector, Ming [52] advanced a helical heat-
collecting SCPP by adding several helical transparent walls within
the collector which could extend the flowing time and hence
increase the air temperature rise in the collector. But this method
might decrease the power output during the night time as a larger
part of the stored energy is used in the daytime.

PThe chimney at the center of the SCPP induces the air to flow
from the collector inlet and also increases the flow velocity due to
the stack effect: the higher the chimney, the faster the fluid flows.
The pressure difference caused by the chimney is generally the func-
tion of gravitational acceleration, chimney height, and the density
difference between the ambience and inner tower [40,49,53].

PThe maximum theoretical efficiency is equal to the Carnot's effi-

ciency in the following Equaztion.

where Tin and Tout are respectively the temperatures at the engine
inlet and exhaust.

PThe tower's efficiency is proportional (/) to its height ht and the
collector efficiency is proportional to the collector area Acoll and
the heat received, therefore in Eq. (4) the power output Pelec is
proportional to the volume included within the chimney height and
the collector area:
/ ht : Acoll

ð4Þ
PLater, Ming et al. [54] conducted a comprehensive analysis on the
stack effect of SCPP and presented a detailed mathematical model to
describe the driving force of the SCPP system (Eq. (5)), in which, the
effects of all SCPP dimensions on the driving force were included
(with the symbols signification as defined in [54]).

Pan interesting design of the turbine system used in SCPPs and an
experimental investigation was conducted to assess the perfor-
mance of a SCPP turbine. Later, von Backstr€om and Gannon [56] pre-
sented an analytical model to express the influences of turbine flow,
load coefficient, and degree of reaction on turbine efficiency. Subse-
quently, Fluri and von Backstr€om [57] conducted an analysis on the
performance of the power conversion unit (PCU, consisting of one or
more turbo-generators, power electronics, a grid interface, and the
flow passage from collector exit-to-chimney inlet), explored
the interaction between the PCU and the SCPP, and compared the
efficiency and output power of three PCU configurations.

PIn the field of CFD simulation with turbine, Pastohr et al. [58]
were the first to carry out a two-dimensional numerical analysis
on a SCPP coupled with turbine. In their research, the pressure
drop at the turbine was imposed as a working condition. No
three-dimensional (pressure, velocity, and temperature) distribu-
tions can be represented with this model, resulting in certain
divergence from actual operating conditions. Nonetheless their
research introduced a valuable approach, enabling subsequent
researchers to numerically analyze the SCPP coupled with tur-
bine. Ming et al.
to
describe the turbine rotation, fluid flow, and heat transfer mech-
anism in the turbine area, conducted a 3-dimensional numerical
simulation on a SCPP coupled with a turbine based on the above
mathematical model, and analyzed the temperature, mass flow
rate, output power and efficiency with turbine rotation speed.
Validation of the numerical model was made thanks to the Span-
ish SCPP pilot and a MW-graded medium scale SCPP was ana-
lyzed. Recently, the optimal ratio of pressure drop across the
turbine in SCPP was also considered [60(cid:1)62].

[59] developed a mathematical model

PHowever, no commercial SCPP has yet been built since the Span-
ish SCPP pilot was built in the beginning of 1980s. One key reason
might be that the initial investment required is quite high for gov-
ernment funding and for enterprises [48,63(cid:1)70]. Currently there are
two methods to reduce the construction cost of a tall chimney. One
is the “floating solar chimney” concept advanced by Papageorgiou
et al. [43,71(cid:1)75], which consists in a self-sustained chimney made
of fabric ring balloons filled by Helium, and could greatly decrease
the initial investment of the tower without significantly decreasing
the overall efficiency [42,44]. The other is the “sloped chimney”
which is built along a high mountain [76(cid:1)84]. Experimental results
indicate that a sloped solar chimney also has good overall perfor-
mance [85].

2.3. The effect of dimensions on SCPP

PIntensive research has been conducted to optimize the different
constituents of MW scaled SCPPs, for instance the chimney shape
[86] and the turbines [87]. To evaluate the performance of a
SCPP, several small prototypes have been built and the operation
parameters measured were compared to theoretical analysis using
numerical simulations, mathematical models and CFD, carried out
by numerous teams [54,88].

PMany parameters have been studied for SCPPs: ambient condi-
tions [89], collector inlet opening and height, outlet diameter, chim-
ney throat diameter, chimney divergence angle [90]. The power
output of a SCPP greatly depends on chimney height and collector
diameter allowing scale economies: multiplying both by 2 increases
power by 4 meanwhile the construction costs are almost only
doubled [23,89].

PA comprehensive review of scientific literature on SCPP was
written by Zhou [91], describing pressure drop under the GH and
inside the tower, optimal sizes, chimney resistance, effects of cross
wind, collector performance, types of thermal energy storage layers,
etc.

PThe technological challenges facing SCPP were recently described
by Lupi, et al. [92] who noted that, due to the very large dimensions
involved, the wind loading process and the structural behavior of
the tower require multi-physics modeling.

PA realistic growth path from the 50 kW prototype of Manzanares
(Spain) with a chimney 200 m high to 200 MW SCPPs with
1000(cid:1)1500 m high towers was proposed by Francke, et al. [93] who
suggested that only one more prototype with a 400 m high chimney
is necessary before industrially-scaled SCPPs enter in operation.
The design of commercial SCPPs was first provided by Schlaich
and resulted in the 200 MW model design SCPP studied by many
researchers. Zongker [37] performed a life cycle assessment (LCA)
for SCPPs. He found that the largest contributor to life cycle impacts
is the GH collector, although ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE)
sheets and glass offer favorable recyclability and durability combina-
tions. Using ETFE, the ratio of “Energy Returned over Energy
Invested” found by Zongker is 14, meanwhile for glass it is only 7. A
cost assessment was published by Fluri et al. [94] who found prices
for the electricity produced 2 to 3 times higher than initially pro-
posed by Schlaich [35]. But recently an actualized cost assessment
by Kr€atzig, et al. [89,95] confirmed for a SCPP 750 m high with a
collector of 3500 m diameter similar cost competitive electricity
generation, in the order of 63 to 75 £/MWh (99 to 131€/MWh). The
differences between the academic authors with the structural engi-
neers and architects come from construction costs (found higher
by the academics) and lower provisional power output. Of course for
all renewables, local solar irradiation and wind characteristics are
important, as well as the size of the plants and their local configura-
tion. Nonetheless, compared with the levelized costs of other types
of renewable energy technologies as shown in Table 2, the results
are promising for all SCPPs. We note that certain assumptions have
been made in these calculations. On the one hand, the authors esti-
mated that the desert site is provided cost-free by the client; on
the other hand, the depreciation time for calculations was 30 or
33 years, while the life expectancy of the plant is estimated in
between 80(cid:1)100 years.

PBergermann and Weinrebe [98] investigated SCPPs with 1 km
high chimney and collector radius of 3500 m and calculated a LECs
of 103 € MWh¡1 with plant locations in North Africa and a total
investment of 750 M€.

PKr€atzig [89] concentrated his cost-estimations on optimized
smaller plants with double glazed collector. For the smallest plant
with 500 m high chimney and collector radius of 1000 m, a total
investment of 111.0 M€ was calculated; whereas for a larger one
with a 750 m high chimney and 1750 m collector radius, the invest-
ment rose to 337.6 M€. The corresponding LECs are 131 € per MWh
and 99 € per MWh

PThe power production per unit of land area or water area was
introduced by MacKay [96] as a useful parameter to assess the per-
formances of renewable energy technologies as shown in Table 3,
based on the energy resources in UK and in European countries. For

Pdifferent scales of SCPPs, the values of the power production per unit
of land area vary greatly. For the 50 kW Spanish SCPP prototype with
collector radius of 122 m [40], the power production per unit of land
area was about 0.1 W m¡2. However, for the 200 MW commercial
SCPP with collector radius of 3500 m [23,35] receiving a solar radia-
tion of 2200 kWh m¡2 yr¡1 (Sahara Desert for instance), the power
production per unit of land area can be calculated as 2 W/m2 which
is comparable to inland wind farms, but lower than for solar PV
panels or for CSP.

PThe figures given by MacKay [96] compare well to the average
total land-use requirements evaluated by NREL in the USA for PV
and for CSP power plants [99]: 1.46 ha GWh¡1 yr¡1 for PV and
1.42 ha GWh¡1 yr¡1 for CSP, which gives an average power produc-
tion per unit of area of 7.8 W m¡2 for PV and 8,1 W m¡2 for CSP.

PDozens of PhD theses and hundreds of scientific publications
have been published, all showing that SCPPs with kilometer high
chimneys can be competitive with wind energy or with PV, also giv-
ing the advantage of no-intermittency thanks to thermal storage
[45,93]. Nonetheless, no commercial scale SCPP has yet been built.
Alternative uses of SCPP have now been published, allowing comple-
mentary revenue or reduced investment by synergies with comple-
mentary technologies [33,34,39].

POn the one hand, the original pilot plant in Spain proved the
concept and showed up new potential such as operating into the
night thanks to natural thermal energy storage in the ground
(and latter in water bags), which can allow this renewable
energy power plant to work 24 h with no intermittency. It also
demonstrated the importance of preventing rain or water to
enter under the collector where the latent heat of evaporation
will reduce the thermal energy available. The pilot plant also
allowed testing of different collector materials and investigation
of techniques for improving the collector efficiency and optimiz-
ing mounting and construction techniques.

POn the other side, the pilot plant also showed up some design
flaws like the turbine design (turning in the horizontal plan) that
was not suited to that plant. It also become evident that the collector
can be slightly sloped from the collector entrance towards the
chimney, in order to guide the rising hot air and reduce friction by
keeping an almost constant cross section. The current complexity of
today's solar plants with thermal storage, make us regret that the
pilot SCPP plant was not used to investigate relatively simple techni-
ques of improving thermal storage, prior to being decommissioned
in 1989. The first numerical simulations (validated against experi-
mental measurements) quickly showed the possible economies of
scale; and the data gathered from the pilot plant are still being used
to validate more and more complex CFD models and numerical sim-
ulations using a variety of novel components.

PA SCPP installed in urban areas has been proposed by Negishi
[100] for the elimination of a low concentration of VOCs. The authors
performed Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) study of the effect of
a filter placed inside the chimney. Land price is expensive and the

Parea available for the GH is generally small in urban areas; so the
SCPP can be driven by waste heat from thermal power plants, or by
geothermal heat, instead of solar energy [101].

PTo summarize this section, it has been seen that substantial
experimental experience obtained with the 50 kW plant in Spain
has helped to spur the development of theories and models of
SCPPs. Energy storage is an area of keen interest; and alternative
uses of SCPPs have been discussed including elimination of
VOCs. On the other hand, the performance and costs of larger
SCPPs is still somewhat uncertain due to the lack of practical
scale ups. Though there are many promising predictions, these
could be subject to bias where undertaken by researchers or
industrialists wishing to justify new projects. SCPPs incorporat-
ing PCR have not been built at all. In the next chapters, we
review the possible synergies between SCPPs and photocatalysis
for CH4, N2O and halocarbon removal
from the atmosphere,
because these important long lived well mixed GHGs all together
have a current RF of almost half of the RF of CO2 (RF of CO2 is
nearly 2/3 of total RF, and cumulated non-CO2 GHGs RF is 1/3 of
total RF).

3. Photocatalysis

PIn this section, after introducing the photocatalysis process, we
review the main options for catalysts and review experiments in
their environmental uses for air cleaning. Means of contacting pho-
tocatalysts with the air will also be reviewed.

PThe IUPAC 2011 [102] definition of photocatalysis is: “Change in
the rate of a chemical reaction or its initiation under the action of ultra-
violet, visible, or infrared radiation in the presence of a substance—the
photocatalyst—that absorbs light and is involved in the chemical trans-
formation of the reaction partners.” Using a catalyst allows to acceler-
ate and/or reduce the temperature of a particular chemical reaction,
that usually requires heat for its activation. Using a photocatalyst
allows generally the chemical reactions to occur at room tempera-
ture thanks to visible light or UV. By harnessing solar energy, photo-
catalytic processes avoid the costly heat input of conventional
thermal catalytic methods.

PSince scientific studies on photocatalysis started four decades
ago, titanium dioxide (TiO2), a common material
in our daily
lives, has emerged as a very good photocatalyst for environmental
purification. Upon photoactivation of the catalyst, adsorbed gases
like oxygen (O2), hydroxide radical
(°OH) and contaminant
species can participate in surface-mediated reactions [103]. The
product species, notably CO2 and H2O according to Eq. (3) for CH4
photooxidation, or N2 and O2 for N2O photoreduction according to
Eq. (1) then desorb easily from the metal oxide surface due to
little affinity.

PIt can be deduced from these equations that the reagents (non-
CO2 GHGs) need to have some affinity for the photocatalyst in order
to be absorbed and react. In case of generation of acidic or alkaline
by-products for example according to Eq. (4), it is necessary to neu-
tralize the by-product, or if it stays on the photocatalyst surface, the
active sites will be de-activated until rinsing with water regenerates
them.

3.1. Types of photocatalytic reactors and types of photocatalysts

PMany types of photocatalytic reactors (PCRs) exist each having
individual advantages and disadvantages [104]. For laboratory
research, PCRs can be divided in 3 main categories [105]: tubular,
plate or honey-comb. Among fixed-bed designs, thanks to their
higher volumes and lower pressure drop, annular reactors and hon-
eycomb monoliths are the most common and useful for photocata-
lytic reactions with gases. Though procedures for scale up of PCRs
have been described [106], few larger PCRs have been developed

Pexcept for wastewater decontamination using photocatalyst suspen-
sions. Besides usual reactor scale-up factor parameters, like mass
transfer and mixing, uniform light distribution for high surface area
of illuminated photocatalyst has also to be taken into account [107],
in particular for solar PCRs [108].

PThe proposals described in this review concern heterogeneous
reactions between a solid photocatalyst and gaseous pollutants
diluted in air. As will be seen in next two sub-chapters, numerous
open field outdoor trials have been conducted, but without outdoors
real-world PCR application (streets, highway lanes, tunnels, etc.),
except for the primary laboratory experiments which validated the
photocatalyst efficiency.

PMany types of photocatalysts exist for heterogeneous photocatal-
ysis under UV light and they are generally based on mineral semi-
conductor metal oxides [109], of which TiO2 is the most used [103].
Some types of photocatalysts are mentioned in Table 4 and these
will be covered more in detail in Section 3 with reference to the min-
eralization of CH4, N2O and halocarbons.

PPhotocatalysts with organic ligands have also been developed
[110], usually in the form of metal-organic frameworks [111]. Many
ways of doping or modifying the photocatalyst are employed, usu-
ally to prolong the functional life-time, to enhance the red-ox activ-
ity and the electron(cid:1)hole charge separation, as well as to enhance
the light absorption and confer visible-light activity to the photoca-
talyst [112]. The photocatalytic activity can also be enhanced by sup-
porting the photocatalyst particles on porous materials like zeolites
[113]. The photocatalyst can be incorporated in porous materials, or
coated as thin films (single or multiple layers) on quartz, glass, poly-
meric substrates or fibers [114].

3.2. Self-cleaning applications

PSelf-cleaning materials are becoming an integral part of daily life,
because of their utility in various applications [125], and an impor-
tant number of products are on the market today. The oldest large
commercial application of photocatalysis is probably for self-clean-
ing glasses [126], typically used for skyscrapers, high-rise hotels and
office-buildings where the access for window-cleaning is difficult.
Under the action of the sunlight on a photocatalytic film coated on
the glass, the organic dirt breaks down and sticks less to the glass
[127]; the organic matter in contact with the photocatalyst is oxi-
dized at an increased rate and is decomposed. Then when it rains,
the photo-induced hydrophilicity [128,129], allows the water to
spread evenly across the surface of the glass like a thin film that
cleans the glass of dirt and minerals and dries off fast without leav-
ing streaks.

PIn 2004, Lee [130] performed experiments of photocatalytic soot
destruction by titania. Lee succeeded in demonstrating that the
photo-generated oxidizing species are both surface mobile and capa-
ble of air-borne diffusion. Experiments conducted with two thin tita-
nia film strips separated by a small ‘titania free’ gap of 0.7 mm. A
continuous soot layer (0.5 mm) was deposited on the titania film
strips and in the gap between them. Photos were taken as a function
of irradiation time of the soot with ultraviolet (UV) light, which

Pvisually demonstrated that the direct photocatalytic soot destruction
can be performed in 4.5 h on thick titania surface films. A prolonged
irradiation (155 h) allowed removal of the soot in the ‘titania free’
gap of 0.7 mm between the two TiO2 strips. This provided visual
evidence of the lateral destruction of soot by UV irradiation that
produces highly oxidizing photogenerated species on the TiO2
photocatalyst. The lateral oxidation of this pollutant was attributed
to the spill-over of hydroxyl radicals or other photogenerated oxidiz-
ing species. Other experiments with 305 h of irradiation allowed
these authors to also demonstrate remote destruction of soot,
175 mm away from the photocatalyst.

PNitrogen oxides are mainly formed by the combustion of fossil
fuel vehicles, together with sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, vola-
tile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter and soot. In areas
with heavy traffic, this type of pollution not only affects the heath
[131], but is also involved in the formation of tropospheric ozone
and summer-smog, and deteriorates building facades. Photocatalyti-
cally active building materials such as house paints, paving stones,
saddle stones, and roofing tiles have been tested to improve the air
quality in cities, and are able to remove nitrogen oxides pollution in
urban areas. An ISO method ISO 22,197(cid:1)1:2007 has been estab-
lished to evaluate NO removal-based air-purification.

PPhotoactive interior textiles, paints, and plasters with antibacte-
rial and antimicrobial properties are used in hospitals [132,133].
They are also used to prevent mould infestations. Air cleaning appa-
ratus with filter systems and photocatalytic systems are also com-
mercially available. Fig. 3 summarizes some of the commercial uses
of photocatalysis.

PIn addition to the reduction of pollutants, photoactive construc-
tion materials exhibit an improved soiling resistance [134]. A posi-
tive side-effect of photoactive products is also the conservation
of value, as the risk of a microbial infestation with algae, fungi or
mildew is significantly reduced.

3.3. Large-scale photocatalysis for environmental remediation

PThe interest in heterogeneous photocatalysis for industrial appli-
cations, such as treatment of gas streams, deodorization and pollu-
tion removal is shown by many indoor-air applications [135] and
large scale worldwide use of photocatalytic self-cleaning cements,
coatings, paints and glass with no unintended consequences yet
reported.

PMany experiments carried out outdoors and at large scale
showed that significant reduction in NOx air pollutants can be
obtained with photocatalytic road materials [136]. Photocatalytic
methods for NOx removal are currently very intense areas of scien-
tific research and full-scale cases of the application of photocatalysts
and photo-processes for NOx abatement are reported [136,137].
Although results are highly variable [138(cid:1)140], the large number of
issued patents [141] for photocatalytic removal of NOx reveals the
fast-growing development of these methods.

PMore and more publications describe full-scale demonstration of
the effectiveness of TiO2-containing construction material in reduc-
ing air pollutants, or in reducing deposition of pollutants on

Pchange locally wind direction and speed, and light intensity by their
shadow.

PThe photocatalytic degradation of NOx from field studies has been
measured by two techniques: (i) by measuring the reduction of the
ambient air pollution, which is difficult to estimate when, in the ref-
erence site the NOx concentration is highly variable; or (ii) by mea-
suring the by-products created by the degradation process on the
photocatalyst surface, i.e. rinsing the photocatalyst with water and
measuring the nitrate content. As reported by Dylla [146], the
nitrates collected onto the pavements coatings show the evidence of
NOx reduction.

PThe photocatalytic activity of cementitious materials containing
TiO2 is also influenced by the size and the nature of the photocatalyst
aggregates [147]: a nano-sized TiO2 was expected to perform better
than a micro-sized TiO2 (respective averages particle size 18 nm and
154 nm) due to its much higher specific surface area, but degrada-
tion of rhodamine B under UV light conducted to the opposite results
as, by a phenomena of aggregation / flocculation, the nano-particles
leads to much bigger secondary particle size.

PLarge-scale indoor and outdoor experiments have been con-
ducted in Japan [138,148], Europe [149] and the US [150] for the in-
situ large scale destruction of NOx [149,151] and VOCs [152,153] and
the principal method limitation is the transport of the pollutants
towards the active surfaces. The environmental factors with signifi-
cant impact are wind direction and speed, solar intensity and rela-
tive humidity [154,155].

PSeveral of the environmental important parameters for photoca-
talytic reactions can be controlled under a SCPP (some parts warmer,
some parts with lower air flux speed, always the same air direction,
low level of urban pollutants in deserts, RH% is naturally low and
decreases as temperature inside the collector increases) depending
on where the photocatalyst is installed. In view that numerous
laboratory scale results, obtained with numerous different photoca-
talysts, as it is shown in the next section, can transform CFCs, N2O
and CH4 and thanks to the very large area available (2 £ 38 km2) and
the large amount of sunlight (UV C visible-light), high transforma-
tion rates might be possible, as it will be shown by calculation in Sec-
tion 5.

PRecently an international team from Italy, Germany, Greece,
France and Belgium [140,156] conducted inside a Brussels tunnel
a fully comprehensive assessment and real world tests of air-
purifying photocatalytic materials for NOCNO2 (NOx) pollutant
abatement.

PBut poor results were obtained in some experiments [142]
(developed later in the discussion of Section 5). The authors reported
that the poor results are due to transport limitations of the pollu-
tants towards the active surfaces. As a matter of fact, the relatively
concentrated NOx generated at vehicle exhausts is rapidly diluted in
the surrounding air and local wind speed due to the vehicles move-
ment, so very small amounts of pollutants reach the photocatalysts
surfaces installed nearby. The good photocatalytic NOx remediation
results from some previous studies by the same authors can be
explained by differences in sampling positions, in sampling periods
and in the geometry of the field sites or by differences between the
reference and the active sites.

PA first set of experiments was performed on a 70 m tunnel sec-
tion (the total photocatalytic area is not indicated but is probably of
nearly 1500 m2) and UV illumination in the 315(cid:1)420 nm range of
»0.6 W m¡2. A second set of experiments was conducted on a 160 m
tunnel section (probably 3500 m2 of total photocatalytic area, not
indicated in the article), with a more efficient commercial photoca-
talyst and UV illumination of »1.6 W m¡2. The new results published
are quite disappointing, despite good results reported from outdoor
experiments of numerous publications from the last 15 years (many
of these articles are reviewed in the two publications just cited, and
some are from the same researchers).

Pbuildings and preserving the cleanliness of buildings or their corro-
sion by acids. Some results are good and others are not, as it will be
seen later [140,142,143].

PMaggos, et al. [144] reported for instance experiments on
three mini-canyon streets (produced at a scale of 1/5), with a
width of 2 m, length of 18 m, and wall height of 5 m. The walls
were: bare for the first canyon, covered with TiO2-treated min-
eral paint for the second canyon, covered with the same paint
material, except it did not contain TiO2 for the third canyon (ref-
erence canyon). An example of canyon street is on Fig. 4. The
measured NOx levels in the canyons varied as expected with the
time of the day and wind direction, as well as the orientation of
the canyon wall. However, the overall NOx concentrations mea-
sured in the TiO2 canyon were 36.7(cid:1)82.0% lower than those
measured on average in the reference canyon.

PIn order to evaluate the depolluting effect by photocatalytic cov-
erings in street canyons, Moussiopoulos, et al. [145] performed com-
parisons of numerical and experimental results. Their numerical
simulations included a wide range of factors: flow field, dispersion
mechanism, the depollution efficiency depending of the length of
the street canyon, the wind direction, and the thermal exchange
between the air and the heated street canyon walls. The model simu-
lations results revealed the dependence of the concentration fields
inside the street canyon and developing flow with the direction of
the approaching wind.

PSolar intensity, wind speed and direction and relative humidity
are outdoors environmental factors with significant impact on pho-
tocatalytic efficiency [146]. The authors think that it needs also to
be taken into account for vehicles passage, which turbulences

PTo give just an illustration among the numerous examples avail-
able, Guerrini [157] reported 20% pollution abatement in the center
of a city tunnel in Rome, meanwhile only an upper limit of 0.4(cid:1)2%
NOx abatement was detected in the Brussels tunnel (comprised in
the 2% uncertainty of measurement) [140,156]. Similar disappoint-
ing results were obtained by the same international team in a model
street canyon [142].

PThe best-case pollutants abatement scenario was evaluated by
this international team with various deposition models and numeri-
cal simulations using CFD. The calculations indicate that at best the
NOx removal can only be of 3% in the 160 m of the Brussels tunnel
section and of 12% if the 3 km of the tunnel were equipped with
the UV lamps and the photocatalytic coating [143], and under the
assumption that ventilation, wind, humidity, temperature stay close
to the ideal conditions and do not affect the reaction rates and
that the photocatalyst deactivation by pollution do not occur. It is
reported by Gallus [140,156] that in the 160 m tunnel section (with
3500 m2 of photocatalyst) and under ideal experimental conditions
(without passivation of
the photocatalytic surfaces, and with
RH%<50%, wind speed<1 m s¡1 and 10 W m¡2 illumination by UVA),
a 20% NOx reduction might have been possible. During the tests
that were conducted, the wind speed went up to 3 m s¡1 and the
RH% was 80(cid:1)90%, and also the temperatures were cold, all
parameters which reduce the abatement efficiency of the TiO2
photocatalyst used. Just to fix ideas, in Section 4, we will see
that the area of the visible-light active photocatalyst proposed is
20 km2, with locations where RH% is almost always <40% and
where visible light illumination in the order 700(cid:1)900 W m¡2,
with UV light representing in the order of 30 W m¡2 (i.e. 4(cid:1)5% of
total as latitude is well below 35°).

PAs expressing findings in terms of percent pollution abatement
can be misleading, the following example expressing the pollutant
reduction in grams or moles of removal per mile of road lane pro-
vides a better illustration: for a highway, Sikkema [158] observed
NO oxidation rates by the photocatalytic coating ranging from
6.2 to 57 nmole¢m¡2 s¡1 (4.0 ¡36 g¢lane-mile¡1 h¡1), while vehicles
emissions were estimated to be 720 g¢lane-mile¡1 h¡1 thus NO
oxidation rates ranging from 0.5% to 5%.

PFig. 5 shows a wall coated with photocatalyst along a multiple
lane urban street. Depending on wind direction, the pollution can
be dispersed and reach the buildings behind. Depending on the
wall orientation, on the hour of the day, and on cloud cover the
photocatalyst will receive variable amounts of sunlight.

PThe extent of the photocatalyst deactivation (by adsorption
of “organic grime” volatile organic hydrocarbons and deposition
of brake dust, soot and other sticking particles) was almost

Fig. 5. Multiple lane urban street: sunlight and pollution (NOx, VOCs) hardly reach the
photocatalytic wall.

Punexpected, as under laboratory conditions deactivation is much
lower and under previous open field tests it usually appears slowly.
But the tunnel where the experiments were conducted is described
as highly polluted with concentrations of 1000 and 400 mg m¡3
annual average half-hour respectively for NO and NO2.

PAs explained by Kleffmann the discrepancy in the results
might come from the extremely high variability of the outdoors
concentrations of atmospheric pollutants and/or the meteorologi-
cal conditions, also to crosswind and turbulences due to vehicles
speed and to the rapid dilution of the vehicles exhaust pollution
by convection and dispersion. The analysis of the discrepancy
between previously published results and new ones was made
by Kleffmann [159] who studied results obtained by Folli [136]
and demonstrated by two different methods that the maximum
NOx removal can be in the order of 0.8% under the experimental
conditions set. Using the same equations and parameters than
Kleffmann, but considering that only 400 m2 area out of the
3000 m2 available of the canyon street were covered by the pho-
tocatalyst, a calculation shows that the upper limit of NO degra-
dation can be 6%.

PIn deserts where the SCPPs can be built, there is no NOx, but
well mixed, long lived GHGs, thus the same calculation has no
sense, but the 20,000,000 m2 of photocatalyst area and an UV
illumination at
least 3 times higher should provide better
results. As will be seen later, in Section 5.3.3 is has been calcu-
lated [21] that for CH4 it can be removed up to 67% under a
SCPP (Table 7).

PIt is often written that UV is in the range 3(cid:1)5% of the total
solar irradiance [160]. By modeling solar irradiance as a function
of location Folli [161] showed that even at the best solar irradia-
tion conditions (the solar noon) this range is applicable only to
latitudes below 35°, which is not the case of Europe. Folli
showed that significant NO oxidation with anastase TiO2 is only
achieved in a test site in Copenhagen (55.68°N) when the UV
intensity exceeds 600 kJ/m2/day at this site (»2% of total solar
irradiance at noon). Adequate performances of the photocatalyst
depend on solar light conditions rigid limits outside which it
simply does not receive enough UV photons [162]. The use of
photocatalysts active under visible light solves these problems.
For example, Zhao [163] developed a Bi/TiO2 nanocomposite
hybrid with the most efficient visible light photocatalytic activity
reaching a NO removal ratio of 50.0 %, superior to that of well
known N-doped TiO2 (36.5%) and C-doped TiO2 (21.8%) and with
27% NO removal capacity at 500 nm (which is in the visible light
range).

PSome explanations of

the discrepancies might also come
from total NOx measurement, while NO concentration often
decreases, in an urban environment polluted by ozone, NO2 con-
centration might increase (and yet it is more toxic). For instance
at the photocatalytic measurement active site, a 0.5 NO/NOx ratio
can be measured although for fresh vehicle emissions the NO/
NOx ratio is typically of 0.85, because the pollutants pass first
the reference measurement site, meanwhile NO is oxidized into
NO2 by atmospheric O3 on its way to the photocatalytic active
site, conducting to erroneous estimations of the NOx abatement.
NO2 might also be a by-product of the incomplete oxidation of
NO on the photocatalyst, or even come from the nitrate depos-
ited on the photocatalyst. Thus selectivity of the photocatalyst
matters and for instance to oxidize nitric oxide to nitrate selec-
tivity can be obtained with W/N- or Nb/N- co-doped titanium
dioxide photocatalysts [164(cid:1)166] which have the ability of gen-
erate very low amounts of NO2.

PThe experiments reported above were made at an already signifi-
cant scale and are based on hundreds of NOx photocatalytic oxida-
tion studies at laboratory scale, but also from tens of indoors and
outdoors experiments.

3.4. Lifetime of photocatalysts and possible regeneration

PChabas [127] analyzed the self-cleaning mechanism of two
hydrophilic photocatalytic TiO2-coated industrial glasses and a tradi-
tional float glass (the reference glass), in a site representative of
background urban pollution in Paris. The glasses were exposed in
unsheltered (where rain washing can occur) and under sheltered
condition for various time duration. A moderate weathering of the
glass surfaces was only detected after 24 months of exposure. A sig-
nificant decrease of the organic fraction deposited on the TiO2-
coated glasses evidenced the self-cleaning mechanism. Years later,
Chabas [167] performed a comparative assessment of the long term
exposure (100 months) and short term (12 months) of self-cleaning
and reference glass in an urban environment. The affinity of the self-
cleaning glass for water vapor and the properties of super hydrophi-
licity were maintained after long exposures. Thus in urban and pol-
luted environments, the life time of a photocatalytic coating in
vertical position can at least be expected in the order of tens of years
with maintained activity if some regular washing (by rain) can occur.
The article did not precise at which floor or height were located the
self-cleaning windows studied, but pollution is clearly more concen-
trated close to the ground were NOx removal experiments take
place.

PSeveral studies report a decrease of photocatalytic activity (for
NOx removal) in outdoor environment: 50% after 5-months [168];
from 36% to 78% after 4-months and from 22% to 88% after a 12-
months period [169]. In the case of NOx removal, as nitrate and
nitrous acid are formed and progressively reduce the amount of pho-
tocatalytic sites available, the outdoor photocatalysts activity recov-
ery is obtained by rainfall or clear water surface washing [170,171].

PNot only water soluble reaction products (nitrate and nitrous
acid) accumulate on the photocatalyst and the substrate. If the pho-
tocatalyst is located on horizontal surfaces like roads or sidewalks,
also urban and traffic generated pollution like motor oil, chewing
gum, de-icing salt, gum tire soot, unburned fuels and particulate
matter will also deposit on the photocatalytic pavements or asphalt.
Many of these pollutants are hydrophobic and reduce significantly
the photocatalytic activity as they block the active sites preventing
the light and the NO and NO2 pollutants to reach them. Pavements
located 1 m above the roadway exhibited almost double photocata-
lytic activity than the ones on the road even after substantial field
exposure [158]. Placing the photocatalytic coating or paint on verti-
cal surfaces like walls or glass windows well above the road and the
side-walks should allow better cleaning and less dirt to deposit.
Inside the laboratory, a reduction of the photocatalytic activity of
aged slabs (stored in plastic bags and unexposed to outdoor pollu-
tion) was explained by calcium carbonate formation and loss of slab
water content. Sikkema [172,173] tested photocatalytic mortar slabs
in a laboratory and outdoors in a roadway field test at Missouri route
141 and also tested several regeneration procedures (brushing and
washing) which were inefficient for many of these contaminants.
The NOx pollution removal rate capacity was more or less 60 times
lower than the NOx estimated emissions by vehicles traffic conduct-
ing to the conclusion that it is difficult to talk of mitigation of this
pollution. As will be seen later in Section 4, the situation is different
in the system proposed here for GHGR of non-CO2 GHGs, mainly
because there is no air-dilution of the targeted pollutants, the areas
of photocatalyst as well as light intensity are much larger and there
are almost no other pollutants in deserts.

PTo summarize this section, while titania is the main photocata-
lyst in use, there is also interest in using a wider variety of modified
photocatalysts for NO and NO2 destruction. Photocatalysis in out-
door applications has been used mainly for self-cleaning and in local
air pollution control. Mounting surfaces include tiles, road surfaces,
and painted walls. Reports on catalyst lifetime vary considerable (cid:1)
lifetime may be shortened rapidly by exposure to grimes, and much

Pdepends on the sitting relative to specific pollution sources. The
comparison of the performance of outdoor systems is hampered
by the complexity of monitoring trace concentrations in the open
environments.

4. Photocatalysis of non-CO2 GHGs

PIn the previous section a general overview of photocatalysis,
its possibilities and its applications to air remediation in particu-
lar for large-scale outdoors NOx de-pollution has been given.
This section reviews photocatalysis literature specifically applied
to the major GHGs other than CO2. As two recent articles
reviewed the possibilities of photocatalytic elimination of N2O
[33] and of CFCs and HFCs [34], in this section the photocatalytic
transformation of CH4 will be covered in more detailed than N2O
and halocarbons.

4.1. Photocatalysis of nitrous oxide

PAt the beginning of the 19700s some dissociation of N2O was dis-
covered in the dark on activated Fe2O3 and ZnO [174], and N2O pho-
todecomposition was demonstrated under UV illumination at room
temperature [175,176]. The photocatalytic N2O reduction into N2
and O2 at 293 K was obtained by many authors on numerous photo-
catalysts, for instance: on Cu-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolites [177(cid:1)181];
on CuC/Al2O3, CuC/SiO2 and CuC/(SiO2/Al2O3) photocatalysts
[182,183]; on calcined and on modified TiO2 [184]; on Ag doped
TiO2 powder [185] and Cerium-doped TiO2 [186]; on photocatalytic
nanocomposite of TiO2/g-C3N4 (ratio 1:2) under UVA (λ D 365 nm)
irradiation [187] and on many different modified ZSM-5 zeolites
with metal oxides or with transition metal ions [119,188(cid:1)193].

PThe photocatalytic reduction of N2O is also obtained using reduc-
ing agents like CO (which oxidizes into CO2) with Ti/USY zeolite
[194]; like methanol (which oxidizes into CO and CO2) using AgC
ions dispersed on TiO2 [195]; like propane using Pb2C/ZSM-5 zeolites
[188,189]; or like water and methanol on Cu- and Ag- supported
TiO2 [196].

PAn almost exhaustive review has been recently published [33] in
which details of the reaction mechanisms suggested in the literature
are given.

PObalov(cid:1)a [120] successfully reduced N2O into N2 and O2 on TiO2,
Ag(cid:1)TiO2 thin films and ZnS- montmorillonite at 254 nm using 8 W
Hg lamps at room temperature, under a neutral gas (He or N2), but
also under a gas mixture containing water vapor and / or excess oxy-
gen. The yields were improved when water vapor was added, as the
possible photocatalytic water splitting gives hydrogen and oxygen
and then, the nitrous oxide reduction with hydrogen produces nitro-
gen and water.

PAs shown previously, successful research has been made on the
photocatalytic mineralization of N2O using currently available TiO2-
based photocatalysts or modified zeolites [197]. The experiments
conducted by Obalov(cid:1)a in the gaseous phase in presence of excess
oxygen (as in air) and at room temperature prove that the direct
photocatalytic reduction of N2O in air is possible. It is still possible
that photocatalysts active under visible light may be developed for
N2O reduction.

PField experiments were carried out [198(cid:1)200] with TiO2 photo-
catalytic paints on the walls of animal husbandries and in particular
of pig houses, in order to decrease NH3, CH4 and the N2O concentra-
tions. The experiments were carried out in real conditions, in air and
at ambient temperature with a ventilation flow in the order of
3000 m3 h¡1. Even if the results obtained were modest: 4(cid:1)11%
decrease of N2O emissions, the results are encouraging as the photo-
catalyst used was un-doped and unmodified, which was not active
under visible-light and that was progressively deactivated by the

Padsorption of HNO3 a by-product of the oxidation of NH3 that can be
easily washed out with clear water.

Pdestruction of Montreal gases and other halocarbons is possible at a
much larger scale. Still the development of photocatalysts active
under visible light might be helpful in this purpose.

4.2. Photocatalysis of several CFCs and HFCs

PThe photodegradation of HFCs on several metal oxides was
described by Tanaka [201] who found that the mineralization rate
was higher on TiO2(cid:1)ZnO (semiconductors), than on SiO2(cid:1)Al2O3
(insulators). Chlorine and fluorine ions and CO2 were the main deg-
radation products obtained.

PAn almost exhaustive review of photocatalytic oxido-reduction of
halogenated compounds was recently published [34] thus only a
rapid overview of CFCs and HFCs removal is given.

PThe photomineralization of CFCs with TiO2 and UV radiation at
366 nm has been described by Tennakone and Wijayantha [122].
The products detected were chlorine Cl2 (gas) and CO2 together with
Cl¡ and F¡ ions.

PKutsuna [202] described the CFC-11 adsorption and its surface
induced degradation in air, on several metal oxides under UV photo-
irradiation (>310 nm) and at room temperature. Wylie [203] also
described the decomposition of HFC-22, CFC-12 and CFC-11 on oxide
surfaces under UV light (>300 nm) and/or under thermal treatment.
PMinami [124] reported that by using TiO2 the decomposition rate
was the lowest for CCl4, and the highest for HFC-22, with the miner-
alization of CH4 in between. The photodegradation of HFC-152a was
studied by Sangchakr [204] at 185 nm by photolysis and by photoca-
talysis at 254 nm with TiO2.

PJo [205] found that the destruction of low-ppb concentrations of
chlorinated VOCs was nearly 100% effective by applying TiO2 photo-
catalysis (the atmospheric concentration of halocarbons goes from
nearly 3 ppt for CFC-13 up to 528 ppt for CFC-12).

PZhou [206] studied the photodegradation of CCl4 using MgO,
Balko [207] using zero valent iron and Choi [208] using TiO2. Wil-
towski [209] also employed TiO2 for the photooxidation of CCl4 and
of 1,1,1-trichloroethylene. Meanwhile Hsu [210] succeed the photo-
reduction of 1, 2-dichloroalkanes and 1, 2-dichloroalkenes using
molybdenum derivatives.

PThe gas-phase TiO2 photocatalytic destruction in air of 17 VOCs
was studied by Alberici [211], with the following conversion yields:
nearly 100% for CHCl D CCl2, 90% for CH2Cl2, 70% for CHCl3, 67% for
CCl2 D CCl2 and 20% for CH3CCl3.

PUsing TiO2 as photocatalyst, Calza [212,213] investigated the
photo-dehalogenation of CBrCl3, CHBrCl2, CH2BrCl and of other halo-
methanes and halons containing bromine and chlorine or bromine
and fluorine (CBr3F).

PYin [214] obtained a rapid decomposition of several HFCs using
bismuth oxide as photocatalyst under visible light irradiation
(>420 nm). Compared with direct photolysis and with a nano-TiO2
photocatalyst, Yin found that the photocatalysis by bismuth oxide
removes more efficiently the hydrofluorocarbons tested.

PThe photocatalyzed transformation of 1,1- and 1,2-dibromo-
ethane to CO2 and HBr was realized by Nguyen [215], and the photo-
catalyic oxidation to CO2 and HCl of CHCl3 by Martin [216] and of
CH2Cl2 by Borisch [217].

PPhotogenerated trihalomethyl radicals were discovered by Choi
and Hoffmann [218], during the TiO2 photodegradation of CHCl3,
CHBr3, and CCl3(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2H.

PNeutralization of halo acids or removal by water rinsing might be
necessary as deactivation of the photocatalysts may occur by F¡, Cl¡
or Br¡ contamination [219]. The regeneration of photocatalysts by
rinsing them with clear water has been described [169,220,221]
2¡ during the photoca-
after deactivation of catalysts by NO3
talytic oxidation of nitrogen oxides (NOCNO2) or sulphur containing
compounds respectively.

¡ or SO4

PTo summarize this section, the laboratory experiments often in
air and at room temperature strongly suggest that the photocatalytic

4.3. Photocatalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons

PThis section reviews evidence showing that photocatalysis is a
very powerful tool for oxidation of long chain and short chain hydro-
carbons including methane.

PD'Auria [222] performed photocatalysis during 100 h of crude oil
from Basilicata (Southern Italy) and obtained extensive degradation:
linear and branched alkanes were reduced by 98.8% and 97.3%, cyclic
alkanes by 96%, aromatic compounds and alkenes were reduced by
99.5% and 98.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, direct irradiation during
the same time (100 h) gave a reduction of 9% and 5% in the case of
linear and branched alkanes respectively.

PDjeghri, et al. [223] studied the photo-oxidation of alkanes, both
normal and branched from ethane to octane, at room temperature
under the influence of UV illumination (210(cid:1)390 nm), on the surface
of non-porous particles of TiO2 anatase.

PBrigden, et al. [224] proceed to the photo-oxidation of short-
chain hydrocarbons (C2(cid:1)C6) over TiO2 with up to 4000 ppm hydro-
carbon and up to 20% O2 concentrations at 150 °C. Very little
reaction was obtained without O2, but the rate of hydrocarbon con-
version increased with the O2 concentration.

PWada, et al. [225] studied the activities of n-type solid metal
oxide semiconductors (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) at ambient tem-
perature and up to 550 K for photo-oxidation of simple C1(cid:1)(cid:1)C3 alka-
nes under aerobic conditions. The oxidation of CH4 produced less
than 10% methanol together with CO2. For these reactions UV irradi-
ation was indispensable. Low yields were obtained at ambient tem-
perature, but they increased with temperature up to 550 K. TiO2
photocatalyst has lower selectivity than ZnO for methanol produc-
tion. Later Wada, et al. [226] studied the selective photo-assisted cat-
alytic oxidation of CH4 and ethane using silica supported vanadium
oxide catalysts, where both a reaction temperature of 500 K and UV
irradiation were essential. Photooxidation of methane using the
V2O5/SiO2- photocatalyst at 493 K gave 76% selectivity for methanol.
PComplete photooxidation to CO2 of ethane, propane and butane
is also possible. TiO2 exhibits fairly high activity but the deep oxida-
tion is predominant [227]. Silica-supported vanadium oxide favors
only a partial oxidation. For ethane, Twesme, et al. [228] tested TiO2
and SiO2/TiO2, but obtained the best results with zirconium oxide
(ZrO2)/TiO2 thin films. The reaction rates increase significantly with
Twesme's operating conditions from 35 to 70 °C, but not anymore by
warming till 100 °C.

P4.3.1. Total oxidation of methane

PThe stability of the CH bond in CH4 (104 kcal mol¡1) makes it very
difficult to activate. Pioneering work [223,229] conducted by Fro-
menti, Teichner and Djeghriin in 1972(cid:1)1974 describes the photo-
oxidation under UV (210(cid:1)390 nm), at room temperature, of linear
and branched alkanes (C2(cid:1)C8), on TiO2 anatase particles.

PBack in 1971, Fujita [230] studied the photo-decomposition
mechanism of CH4 on coated porous Vycor glasses at 77 K (¡196 °C).
When the Vycor glasses where coated with V2O5 and MoO3 they
showed the largest photo-sensitization of CH4, meanwhile when
coated with MnO2 or Al2O3 they showed photo-desensitization.

PHCOOH, CO, CO2 and H2O were obtained during the photooxida-
tion of CH4 over powered TiO2 under UV by Lien, et al. [231] using
18O2. At the beginning of the UV irradiation, the formate detected
was HC16O16O indicating that the TiO2 lattice oxygen was involved.

PKaliaguine, et al. [232] studied the reactions of CH4 and ethane by
UV irradiation of V5C/SiO2 and stoichiometric TiO2. They concluded
that after completion of the oxidation of the hydrocarbon molecule a

Preduced stable V4C ion was left on the surface with a reactive behav-
ior that gave the peculiarities to the system under UV light.

PSome researchers like Kaliaguine used a vanadium derivative
(V5C/SiO2) as photocatalyst, but very often researchers only used
TiO2 derivatives [224,228,233(cid:1)237] to investigate the kinetics of the
total oxidation of n-alkanes and alkenes (methane, ethane, ethane,
propene. . .).

PMinami and Kim [124] proceeded to the photocatalytic oxidation
of CH4, CHF2Cl, and CCl4 over TiO2 because the similar structure of
these compounds with different constituents. The highest decompo-
sition rate was obtained with CHClF2, then CH4 and CCl4 in decreas-
ing order.

Pwavelength, the temperature, the irradiation intensity and the
dependence of the reaction rate on the starting products concentra-
tion. Previously for olefin photooxidation, Haeger, et al. [234]
observed some reversible photocatalyst deactivation and, due to a
different reaction mechanism, they obtained a rate law differing
from the one found for alkanes oxidation where no photocatalyst
deactivation was observed.

PLiu, et al. [239] investigated the photocatalytic degradation of low
level CH4 by TiO2 under vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light. These lamps
generate ozone. Under certain experimental conditions Liu obtained
50% CH4 removal rate using 15 W UV lamps (185 nm and 254 nm) as
seen on Fig. 7.

acetyl

acetone

(Ti(OC4H9)4),

tetrabutylorthotitanate

PThe characteristics of the photocatalytic reactor used and of the
photocatalyst preparation were described in a previous article [240].
A C-TiO2 photocatalyst film was used in these studies and was pre-
pared by a modified sol(cid:1)gel method. By mixing at room tempera-
ture,
(a
chelating agent used to control the hydrolysis of tetrabutylorthotita-
nate), deionized water, and n-propanol with a volumetric ratio of
1:0.3:0.4:7, a yellowish titanium dioxide solution was prepared.
Then nanometric carbon black powder of 18 nm primary particle
size and 265 m2/g BET surface (Degussa Printex L6) was added in the
solution at the ratio of 2.35 mg carbon black for 1 ml Ti(OC4H9)4.
According to the authors, the prepared mixture could remain stable
for months at ambient temperature. The mixture was blended uni-
formly by ultrasound for 10 min before use for coating. Then the
mixture was dipped and dried at room temperature on a polished
aluminum sheet (440 mm length - 201 mm height and 0.18 mm
thickness), and then baked for 2 h at 500 °C. The same operation
(immersion-coating) was done 7 times (according to a previous opti-
mization) to form a thin C-TiO2 photocatalyst film. The authors
found that the C-TiO2 film was very stable and durable without any
loss during application.

PA cylindrical reactor of 1.4 l effective volume (64 mm diameter,
530 mm length, 1.7 l total volume) was used to conduct the photo-
chemical reactions. The interior surface of the reactor was closely
covered by the C-TiO2 coated aluminum sheet. With an initial con-
centration 9 mg m¡3 of CH4, at a flow rate 8 L min¡1, 50% CH4
removal rate was obtained (4.5 mg m¡3 min¡1) with the C-TiO2 pho-
tocatalyst using 15 W UV lamps (185 nm and 254 nm), with a rela-
tive humidity of nearly 30%. These laboratory scale experiments
using a “small” reactor were interestingly done in a continuous flow
reactor. At a 8 L min¡1 flow rate, the CH4 flux speed is 2.5 m min¡1
(0.15 km h¡1), corresponding to a gas residence time in the reaction
zone of about 10 s. It is the authors’ opinion that this conditions and
better can be obtained under a SCPP-PCR.

POther researchers like Krishna, et al. [117,238] discovered uranyl
derivatives with high activity to perform at ambient temperature
the total oxidation of CH4 by photocatalysis under sunlight in the
presence of air. No partial oxidation products (CH3OH, CHO, HCOOH,
CO) were detected by Krishna. The uranyl ions were anchored within
a mesoporous silicate molecular sieve named MCM-41, which is easy
to produce. Depleted uranium (with less radioactive isotopes) is an
abundant by-product of the uranium enrichment for the nuclear
energy and might be used without risks on this type of application.
In Fig. 6 the kinetics of CH4 oxidation obtained by Krishna [117] at
different concentrations can be seen as a function of irradiation time
versus conversion to CO2. These concentrations are 4 orders or mag-
nitude larger than current CH4 concentration in the atmosphere.

tested tungstosilicate

(SiW12O40)4¡ loaded on TiO2 and on alumina (Al2O3) powders and
found than the first one is active in the photoinduced oxidation of
CH4 at ambient temperature to give CO, CO2, and H2O. On TiO2, in
the absence of tungstosilicate, the total oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and
H2O occurs.

[115],

PThe same team by Graetzel, et al. [116] also tested TiO2 supported
on molybdenum under band gap illumination. In their experimental
conditions, use of pure TiO2 led to the complete oxidation of CH4 to
CO2, in the presence of oxygen. Meanwhile molybdenum oxide
(MoO3) alone or supported on Al2O3 or on SiO2 showed poor activity
in the photoactivation of CH4, the deposition of 4% MoO3 on TiO2
had a pronounced effect on CH4 photoactivation, a competing reac-
tion pathway produced CO by partial oxidation.

PThe TiO2 photocatalysed total oxidation reaction of C1(cid:1)C4 alka-
nes (CH4, ethane, propane and isobutane) with oxygen was investi-
gated by Haeger, et al. [235]. They studied the effects of the

Ponly visible light, the 0.1% Ag(cid:1)ZnO nano-photocatalyst can proceed
to more than 90% oxidation of the CH4 in 150 min. On Fig. 9, at a
concentration of 100 p.p.m. it takes nearly 15 min to have 100%
conversion of CH4 into CO2, while at 500 p.p.m. it takes nearly
40 min, and 100 min at 3000 p.p.m. The current concentration of
CH4 in the atmosphere is only 1.8 p.p.m. so it can be expected that
the total oxidation will take an even shorter time.

PAs atomic chlorine is a sink for atmospheric CH4 [244], another
complementary strategy to reduce atmospheric levels of CH4, can be
the enhanced generation of °Cl thanks to photocatalytic Fe(II)/Fe
(III) oxido-reduction in the atmosphere [245].

PAs seen from the examples above, the total oxidation of CH4 is
possible in air, at ambient temperature, under artificial illumination
or under sunlight, using relatively simple and inexpensive photoca-
talysts like TiO2, C-TiO2 and Ag-ZnO.

P4.3.2. Partial oxidation of methane

PAs previously mentioned, CH4 is an abundant hydrocarbon,
widely used as a fuel given its high calorific value. Mainly due to the
fact that large amounts of natural gas are available in remote areas
from the energy consumers with limited options to transport the
gas, much work is being carried out in order to develop new cata-
lysts and photocatalysts that can convert CH4 into higher-value
chemicals, often liquids easy to transport. From an environmental
and energy perspective CH4 transformation and direct oxidation into
oxygenated products such as methanol is an attractive process. Con-
sequently, nowadays an important amount of research is devoted to
the selective CH4 oxidation into products other than CO2 and has
been an on-going effort this last two decades.

PIn the photocatalytic approach, when °OH species oxidize CH4,
the formation of CH3(cid:1)(cid:1)OH is expected to occur from the generation
of methyl radicals (CH3), but then the subsequent oxidizing reactions
can produce numerous other by-products. For this reason, currently
the researchers try to avoid the complete oxidation of CH4 and the
formation of CO2 and thus try to control the extent of the oxidation
steps.

PFor instance Lopez and Mart(cid:1)ınez [246] studied the selective
photo-assisted oxidation of methane into formaldehyde on mesopo-
rous VOx/SBA-15 photocatalysts that were seen to be more effective
in terms of selectivity than VOx / SiO2 catalysts. SBA-15 are silica
nanoparticles with much larger nanometre pores (4.6 to 30 nm)
than the MCM-41 mesoporous silicate molecular sieve used by
Krishna, et al. [117,238].

Fig. 8. UV and visible light activity of nano-photocatalysts ZnO, ZnO(cid:1)(cid:1)C and 0.1%
Ag(cid:1)(cid:1)ZnO, during methane total oxidation experiments. The initial CH4 concentration
is of 100 p.p.m. commercial P25 TiO2 photocatalyst is used for comparison (repro-
duced from Chen et al. [118]).

PSeveral other experiments were carried on by Liu, et al. [239]:
with TiO2 the CH4 removal was much higher than just with vacuum
ultraviolet light. Addition of H2O2 and NOx was not favorable for the
CH4 removal, but significantly reduced the outlet ozone concentra-
tion.

PNumerous kinetics of CH4 oxidation are given by Dreyer [241]
and [242] using an ultra-low density UV-accessible aerogel
photocatalyst.

PRecently Pan et al. [243] demonstrated that SrCO3 over SrTiO3
nano-photocatalyst can proceed to complete oxidation of CH4. Also
Chen et al. [118] developed a very efficient Ag(cid:1)ZnO photocatalyst
with only 0.1% Ag which oxidizes CH4 quickly, even in continuous
flow reactor experiments. The next two Figs. 8 and 9, show respec-
tively that this nano-photocatalyst exhibits visible light activity and
that the lower the methane concentration, the faster the speed
of the reaction. From Fig. 8, where CH4 initial concentration is
100 p.p.m., it can be noted that simple ZnO nano-photocatalyst
prepared under the same experimental conditions can also proceed
to complete oxidation of CH4 in 150 min (10 times more than
with 0.1% Ag(cid:1)ZnO), and more than 80% conversion in 50 min. Using

PAlthough few researchers reported the amount of undesired
products obtained (CO2) some information is available. For instance,
Murcia-Lopez, et al. [247] wanted to selectively produce methanol
and/or ethane from CH4. They achieved an almost complete inhibi-
tion of undesired CO2 by-product, with BiVO4 photocatalyst in the
presence of a low concentration of nitrite. But in these operating
conditions after the first 60 min the highest CO2 concentrations are
reached then the CO2 formation rates decreases. Nitrite increases
the initial formation of CH3OH at the expense of a decrease of CO2
formation, which is expected as most of the CO2 comes probably
from oxidizing stages of methanol. For Murcia-Lopez, et al. [247],
nitrite ions might act both as a UV filter and as a hydroxyl radical
scavenger. A similar trend was observed when using an alternative
photocatalyst Bi2WO6, in presence of nitrite, lower CO2 production
and higher selectivity for ethane production are observed. When
Bi2WO6 was coupled with TiO2, the methane conversion increased
[248]; however, the undesired over-oxidation of CH4 to CO2 predom-
inates. A similar effect is observed when electron scavengers such as
Fe3C are introduced in the photoreactor as a result of the formation
of highly oxidant radicals. All the photocatalysts tested by these
authors were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method.

PXin [249] successfully oxidized CH4 with niobium (1.4%) incorpo-
rated into silica-based mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41. The
reaction was carried out in the gas phase over 30 min, at 323 K, at
atmospheric pressure with irradiation by a UV lamp (250(cid:1)430 nm).
The gas mixture tested was 45% CH4, 5% O2 and 50% He). As CH4 is in
excess compared to O2, the CH4 conversion yield was only of 10%
with Nb2O5, to give mainly CO2. The CH4 conversion yield reached
18% with Nb-MCM-41 which was reacted after adsorption of water.
Under these conditions some methanol (0.29 mmol) was obtained,
but CO2 is still the main product of the reaction (107.5 mmol or
370 times more than methanol).

PPartial oxidation of CH4 to methanol using bismuth-based photo-
catalysts Bi2WO6, BiVO4, and Bi2WO6 coupled with TiO2 was also
succeeded by Murcia-Ló pez [248], in aqueous phase at 55 °C. All
photocatalysts yield some small amount of ethane. The conversion
rate is small with BiVO4, and Bi2WO6 and the ratio of CO2/CH3OH
obtained is respectively of approximately 1 and 2. Meanwhile with
Bi2WO6/TiO2 the conversion rate is nearly 4 fold, and the ratio is
almost 12 in favor of CO2.

PVilla et al [250]. synthesized mesoporous WO3 and explored the
effect of the addition of electron scavengers (Fe3C, Cu2C, AgC) in
aqueous phase at 55 °C. In the presence of AgC ions, the yields of eth-
ane and methanol were the lowest and the CO2 generation rates
were the highest.

PThe same team also tested tungsten oxide (WO3) and several
derivatives [250,251]. They succeeded in improving the selectivity
for the desired products, but the levels of CO2 production were still
high (nearly 3 times more than methanol and ethane, with the
unmodified WO3) at »55 °C under UV(cid:1)visible light irradiation, with
1 g catalyst L¡1 under a continuous CH4 flow of 4.5 mL min¡1.

PSo even if the on-going current research in this area is oriented
towards the partial photocatalytic oxidation of CH4, high amounts of
complete oxidation to CO2 are often observed (but not reported in
publications) and small improvements to reach the goal of complete
mineralization of CH4 are feasible.

Pfound to be the best support for gold nanoparticles both in terms
of activity and gold particle stability.

PPartial oxidations of CH4 by selective photocatalysis often pro-
duce CO2 as a by-product, especially in the case of low selectivity or
low yields. The high stability of CH4 requires high energy levels for
its conversion and remains a problem to be solved. In order to con-
vert CH4 into hydrogen and into more useful chemicals various
efforts have been carried out [254]. For obtaining useful organic
products like ethane and higher hydrocarbons, as well as formalde-
hyde, methanol or syngas, the selective photocatalytic conversion
of CH4 by coupling or partial oxidation is needed and has been
reviewed [254,255] and the main reaction schemes are:

CH4 C xO2 ! oxidation products ðCO2 C CH3OH C HCHO C HCOOHÞ C H2O

or

xCH4 ! C2 (cid:1) C6 compounds

PAs seen at the beginning of this section, to overcome the thermo-
dynamic barrier photocatalysis has been proposed as one of the
answers. New developments in the photocatalytic conversion of
CH4, such as CH4 coupling and CH4 conversion with other molecules
is currently an intensive research topic.

PShimura [256] reviewed the three types of photocatalytic reac-
tions for CH4 conversion, that can be realized at a mild condition
between ambient temperature and 473 K using semiconductor pho-
tocatalysis and photoenergy, i.e.:

ð8Þ

PShimura et al [257,258] worked on photocatalytic steam reform-
ing of CH4, either with Pt-loaded or unmodified calcium titanate
or sodium tantalate photocatalysts at nearly room temperature.
They concluded that photocatalytic steam reforming of CH4 and pho-
tocatalytic water decomposition proceeded simultaneously.

PAlthough the goal of these processes is to photocatalytic conver-
sion of concentrated CH4 into liquid or gaseous fuels, these reactions
should be kept in mind as they can also help to reduce the radiative
forcing of atmospheric CH4.

PIn summary, this section has highlighted the wealth of available
catalytic reactions for mineralizing CH4 or to transform it, not only
using titania, but also using tungstosilicateD
X, uranyl compounds and
other semi-conductor metals like ZnO. The experience in this area
is very promising for future applications in hybrid SCPP-PCRs.

P4.3.3. Other photocatalytic methane transformations

PThe conversion of CH4 to more valuable chemicals is one of the
most intensively studied topics in catalysis. CH4 reforming or oxida-
tion by thermal catalysis requires high temperatures [252] and is
therefore out of the scope of this review. Nevertheless it is worth
being mentioned that Walther [253] succeeded with CH4 oxidation
on 2 nm gold nanoparticles supported on various metal oxides at
low temperature (130(cid:1)250 °C). For full oxidation to CO2, TiO2 was

Pis important to get an idea of the scale needed by way of first
approximation.

PThe estimates may depend on the configuration of the system for
which there are several options. For example, the photocatalyst can
be installed on the ground of the SCPP (the GH is 38 km2 for a model
SCPP of 200 MW), but it can also be coated on the inner part of the
glass (or plastic) of the canopy. A daily air flow of 17 km3 passes
through a 200 MW SCPP (>6000 km3 yr¡1). Of course the relevant
volume is only one third this amount, if the photocatalytic remedia-
tion takes place only 8 h day¡1 under intense sunlight, but night
operation strategies are proposed later. As the amount of CH4 in the
atmosphere is 1.83 ppm, if 17 km3 of air passes every day under
the GH of a 200 MW SCPP, this represents more than 31 000 m3 of
CH4 per day and nearly 0.011 km3 of atmospheric CH4 per year pass-
ing under a single SCPP. With current atmospheric GHGs
concentrations, per year this SCPP air flow contains (rounded num-
bers) 7900 tons of CH4, 3900 tons of N2O, and nearly 42 tons
of halogenated compounds, representing all together more than
1.5 Mtons yr¡1 eq-CO2 [22].

PIn a canyon street (Fig. 4), as the buildings shadow moves during
the day, and as pollution (VOCs C NOx) levels depend on traffic inten-
sity as well as on wind turbulences and direction, the area of photo-
catalyst receiving sunlight and pollution varies. Under the collector
of a SCPP, which acts as a GH, the air flow direction will in contrast
always be the in same direction (radial towards the center of the col-
lector), and the airflow speed will be almost constant until arriving
near the collector center (assuming that the collector height
increases (cid:1) see Section 2.3, and collector slope on Fig. 13). Thus in
SCPPs the operation would be more like in indoor experiments,
where the results are better than outdoors, as important parameters
can be controlled.

PUnder the envisaged SCPP, the nano-sized photocatalytic coating
on the inner side of the canopy is translucent, active under visible
light and activated by the sunlight penetrating under the GH and
reaching the floor, where other types of photocatalysts can be set up
and activated by visible light [259]. As seen in Fig. 10, the best direct
sunlight irradiation is mostly maintained, as there is almost no
shadow. The partition walls under the GH prevent external rapid
crosswind from disturbing the slow hot airflow under the GH, which
thus moves radially towards the central tower [260]. Ambient cross-
wind entering under the GH by the front compartments is also

translucent photocatalytic coating and reaching the ground to activate other types of
photocatalysts [260].

Pguided by the partition walls to the turbines at the chimney
entrance.

PThe temperature increases, and relative humidity (RH%)
decreases, from collector entrance towards the bottom of the chim-
ney. The RH% is at its maximum at tower exit, then during ascension
in the chimney the temperature decreases and sometimes the con-
densation temperature is reached. Consequently, depending on
the properties of the photocatalyst that will be used, its location
under the SCPP GH can be adjusted so that several of the operating
parameters are optimal.

PThe pressure drop is an important parameter in estimating air-
flow, and has been reviewed by several authors. Gannon et al.
[261,262] evaluated the different pressure drops in SCPPs through a
one-dimensional compressible flow approach and with wind tunnel
experiments using a 0.63 m diameter small chimney model. The
pressure drop associated with the vertical acceleration of the air
and the loss due to the chimney internal bracing wheel and spokes
(the tension system inside the chimney to prevent ovalization), was
found to be much higher than the pressure drop associated with
wall friction; thus smoothing the walls will have a small effect.

PIn order to maximize contact time between the molecules in air
(CH4, N2O, CFCs and HFCs) and the photocatalyst coating, multiple
translucent layers of photocatalyst spaced are proposed at the
entrance of the SCPP as seen on Fig. 11. The pressure drop will
depend on the layers spacing, as generally pressure drop is given by
an equation of the form of Eq. (6):

Dp D fD ¢

ry2
2

¢ L
D

ð6Þ

where L is the length of the channels between the layers and D is the
hydraulic diameter), fD is the Darcy friction factor (typically in
the range 0.002(cid:1)0.01 for turbulent flow) r the air(cid:1)density and y the
flow velocity. Thus the local pressure drop should be determined
from an optimization study to determine the requisite surface to vol-
ume ratio of catalyst, traded off against the pressure drop penalty.
Nonetheless, at this stage it is noted that the velocity y at the
entrance is very much lower than at the center of the SCPP, and can
be made even lower by increasing the height of the collector
entrance as indicated in Fig. 11. As the pressure drop depends on the
square of y, it is therefore anticipated that the pressure drop penalty
should not be too great (see also Section 5.3.2).

PFor reference, the pressure drops to perform the chemical
removal of CO2 directly from the atmosphere with a solid to air
exchanger (using alkali solid resin) are in the order of 20(cid:1)40 Pa, and
with a liquid to air exchanger (similar to the ones in wet cooling
towers) using an aqueous solution of alkalis the pressure drop is in
the order of 100(cid:1)150 Pa [39,263].This latter system is being used by
the firm “Carbon Engineering” which proposes the “air contactor” of
Fig. 12 [15,264], requiring hundreds of electrical fans and consuming
electricity.

PIt is the authors’ opinion that the preferred configuration should
be the one of Fig. 10, because the light penetration is more efficient
than in Fig. 11 configuration (some losses occurs when crossing each
of the multiple layers) and mass transfer of GHG from air to photoca-
talyst is similar in both configurations (same area of photocatalyst,
the airflow puts much longer time to pass across the photocatalytic
area under configuration of Fig. 10, allowing efficient mass transfer
to occur).

PIf all our electrical energy needs (estimated at 8.8 TW electrical
capacity or 31 PWh per year electricity generation [9] by 2030) were
satisfied with 200 MW SCPPs, 50,000 such SCPPs would be required,
and nearly one atmospheric volume would pass through them every
15 years. In this scenario of satisfying 100% of the electrical energy
needs, no more CO2 will be emitted for electricity production
and oceans acidification will be slowed down. With 50 000 such
SCPPs-PCRs, this amounts to total abatement of 80 Gt CO2eq per

Pyear. For comparison, according to Williamson [29], it is necessary to
remove in total 600 Gt eq-CO2 to stabilize global warming to within
2 °C this century. Therefore, subject to the assumptions made, the
proposed SCPP-PCR technology may indeed achieve mitigation and
removal at the necessary rate and scale; and even 5 000 to 10 000
such negative emissions power plants could help to stay under the
total carbon budget compatible with 2 °C goal.

P10 000 SCPPs-PCRs can provide 2 TW amounting for 16 Gt CO2-eq
abatement per year. The total surface covered being 380,000 km2,
representing nearly 23 times the area of the city of Beijing; alterna-
tively 4% of the entire Sahara Desert, 16% of the Arabian Desert, or
28% of the Australian deserts (which cover 18% of Australia).

PInstead of being the only component of the energy portfolio, a
reasonable aim for SCPPs is just to take a significant part (10(cid:1)20%)
on the energy mix of the future, which has to be diversified with
increased use of most renewables. SCPPs are expected to require low
maintenance [35], providing robust and long lasting power plants,
producing electricity at almost zero cost after the repayment of loans
and capital. According to Harte [36], their designed service-lives is of

P100 years and more, which is 2 times longer than that of nuclear or
fossil fuel power plants and 3 or 4 times longer than wind, PV, and
CSP power plants. SCPPs provide a radical technological break-
through: they are a non-CO2 emitting source to produce renewable
electricity from free-sunlight, presenting many synergies when
associated with photocatalytic destruction of non-CO2 GHGs.

5.2. Large-scale atmospheric photocatalytic transformation of GHGs

PPreviously work cited in this review was almost all done at the
laboratory scale, but some articles mention the photo-elimination of
CH4 at a larger scale (Espagnol, et al. [265], Guarino, et al. [198], and
Costa, et al. [199,266]). These works are especially interesting
because they come closer to the focus area of the current review.

PPromising results with CH4 were presented in 2006 by Espagnol
et al. [265]. To reduce gaseous emissions, Espagnol used a photocata-
lytic cover during the storage of slurry from 54 pigs. The slurry was
split between two experimental vats each of 13 m3 and stored out-
side. A pilot photocatalytic cover overlaid one of the vats and, using

Pa tracer method, gaseous emissions from the vats were measured
continuously over 2 months. The photocatalytic covering was quite
efficient with an oxidation rate of 59% for NH3 and of 71% for CH4.

PGuarino and Costa [198,199,266] confirmed the results obtained
with CH4 by Espagnol, et al. [265] although with different experi-
mental conditions. In order to reduce NH3 and GHGs emissions from
animal husbandries, Guarino and Costa used a TiO2 photocatalytic
low cost coating paint on the walls of a pig house. Two identical
mechanical ventilated farrowing rooms were used to conduct
the trials, and the gas concentrations and ventilation rate were con-
tinuously monitored in the two units over one month. The average
concentration of CH4 was reduced by 15(cid:1)27% when lightening the
walls by 36 W UV lamps. These results can be compared to the ones
obtained by Liu et al. [239]. Thanks to a continuous flow reactor of
1.4 l, using 15 W UV lamps Liu et al. reached 50% CH4 removal rate at
a CH4 flow rate 8 L min¡1.

PThe reaction speeds obtained by Melse and Hilhorst [267], during
the photooxidation at 365 nm of CH4 in exhaust air from of liquid
manure storages and animal houses, were slow on TiO2 coated on
wool, but 20 times faster on TiO2 coated on quartz fibers.

PBellobono, et al. [237,268,269] studied in laboratory-scale annu-
lar reactor, the photo-mineralization of (10(cid:1)1000 ppm) CH4 in air,
by photocatalytic membranes immobilizing TiO2, with flow rates
from 4 m3 h¡1 up to 400 m3 h¡1. Bellobono also studied the photo-
mineralization of CH4 in water [270]. With standard flow rate of
300 m3 h¡1, in presence of oxygen, in the gas phase saturated by
water, Bellobono, et al. [269] found that at 318 K the mineralization
of CH4 with TiO2 immobilized in photocatalytic membranes pro-
ceeds completely, as it occurs in the liquid phase.

PThe previous section demonstrated that successful research was
carried out on the photocatalytic oxidation or reduction of CH4, N2O
and HC in the gaseous phase. Almost all of the research experiments
concerning HC and CH4 were
atmospheric
pressure and in air (in presence of excess oxygen). So, direct photo-
catalytic oxido-reduction of HC and oxidation of CH4 in air is possi-
ble. In the case of the photocatalytic reduction of N2O, earlier articles
describe experiments under reduced pressure sometimes with a
neutral rare carrier gas like He [185]. Recent experiments conducted

conducted at

Pby Obalov(cid:1)a [120,121] were done in the presence of excess oxygen
and the photoreduction yield was slightly enhanced. The nitric oxide
(NO) photodecomposition into N2, and O2 is well documented [137],
but it also gives some amounts of N2O. In presence of reducing
agents like CO or NH3 no N2O is obtained. The selectivity of photore-
duction of NO into N2 and O2 is favored by iron doping of TiO2 [271]
and transition metal oxides in zeolites [272]. As N2 and O2 readily
desorb from the photocatalyst surface during this photoreduction
reaction, no deactivation occurs; whereas NOx removal by photooxi-
dation produces nitrate species that need to be washed away for
photocatalyst regeneration.

POnce the best photocatalysts candidates are selected, it will be
possible to use several of them under the SCPP collector at different
locations, allowing selective transformation of several different non-
CO2 GHGs and ozone depleting gases. Judicious positioning of the
different catalysts would allow optimization of the operating condi-
tions for each one; for example, the temperature is lower (and the
RH% higher) where the air enters at the SCPP perimeter, increasing
towards the center.

POn the one hand, the local surface-to-volume and mass transfer
may be improved if multiple layers are used as shown in Fig. 11, but
the visible-light intensity decreases progressively with the number
of layers of coated glass or polymeric sheet. On the other hand, very
large photocatalyst areas as shown on Fig. 10 may allow longer con-
tact time and photocatalyst illumination, but with perhaps poorer
mass transfer due to thicker boundary layers. In Fig. 13a SCPP-PCR
system is shown that may overcome the disadvantages in each case,
allowing installation of 4 different layers of photocatalyst at differ-
ent locations under the GH, with varying temperatures and airflows.
This arrangement also offers improved energy storage [273].

PBecause of its low cost, high stability, strong oxidizing power and
non-toxicity (proved by many years of use in medicines and cosmet-
ics) TiO2 is widely used and studied, in particular for environmental
applications and for the degradation of certain pollutants. Introduc-
tion of nano-particles has increased the surface area and light trans-
parency;
for example, composite nano-photocatalysts made of
semiconductor oxides and high surface area adsorbents on supports
such as silica, alumina, carbon or zeolites [274].

PConsiderable progress has been made by researchers to induce
visible-light activity via numerous modification types [275,276], as
it often increases the efficiency and quantum yield. Although
the development of new non-toxic and low-cost visible(cid:1)light active
photocatalysts still seems interesting, the efficiency of available
doped nano-sized TiO2 photocatalysts is already satisfactory for
practical use in mineralization of CFCs, HFCs and CH4, and for N2O
reduction; and numerous cheap and abundant semiconductor oxides
as well as modified zeolites [197] are also good candidates. A sus-
tainable large-scale implementation needs also to address long-term
stability and activity under strong solar irradiation, requiring further
tests and research. Once the photocatalysts and the operating condi-
tions are chosen, then the design specifications can be formulated
and the economics worked out.

5.3. Mass transfer in the SCPP

P5.3.1. Mass transfer for photocatalysis

PThough there is valuable experience of energy conversion in
SCPPs, and several models have been developed for this, there is no
comparable experience of using SCPPs as photocatalytic reactors.
Therefore it is important to review studies of other types of photoca-
talytic reactor to gain insights regarding mass transfer and photoca-
talytic performance.

PSeveral processes may govern mass transfer in a photocatalytic
reactor. In a study of photocatalytic air cleaners for the built environ-
ment, Zhong and Haghighat [154] identified as many as seven ele-
mental mass transfer processes involved (Fig. 14):

P(i) advection of reactants (e.g. methane) by the airflow;
P(ii) mass transfer from the bulk flow to the exterior surface of the

catalyst via boundary layers;

(iii) molecular or Knudsen diffusion through the pore structure of

the catalyst;

(iv) adsorption at interior pore surfaces;
P(v) photochemical reaction kinetics at interior surfaces;
(vi) desorption of reaction products;
(vii)mass transfer by diffusion and advection back to the bulk air

stream and outlet (Fig. 12).

PSince these processes occur in series, any one may in principle
limit the overall rate of reaction. Light availability and penetration to
the catalyst can present a further limitation, according to the quan-
tum efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction [277].

PZhong et al. [278] represented multiple processes of boundary
layer mass transfer and reaction kinetics at interior surfaces,
together with light penetration, in an integrated model of an indoor
UV photocatalytic air cleaner that they verified by experiment. Their
reactor was only 0.76 m long. In comparison, outdoor reactors are
large in scale (tens of meters typically), suggesting that advection
and bulk mass transfer through boundary layers will be limiting
the limiting processes, as assumed by Sikkema in a study of photoca-
talytic paving [158]. These processes are represented non-dimen-
sionally by Sherwood (Sh) number correlations, typically of the form

PSh D constant £ Rem Sc n, where Re and Sc are the Reynolds and
Schmidt number respectively, and m and n are constants usually
less than one. Examples of Sherwood correlations used in photocata-
lytic studies and elsewhere are included in Table 5. The definition of
the Sherwood number is Sh D KL/D where K (m s¡1) is the mass
transfer coefficient to be determined, L (m) is the characteristic
length and D (m2 s¡1) is the diffusion coefficient of the reacting spe-
cies moving through the air. Table 5 is useful to illustrate the general
form of the applicable relationships, which can also lead to prelimi-
nary predictions of mass transfer performance as discussed next.

P5.3.2. Dimensional analysis of transfer processes

PExtension of the function of the SCPP to that of a photocatalytic
chemical reactor requires effective design with respect to heat, mass
and momentum transfer. Heat transfer to the moving air will pro-
mote energy conversion by increasing collector efficiency; and mass
transfer will promote photocatalytic performance. On the other
hand, momentum transfer may be detrimental to energy conversion
if it increases pressure drop significantly. Dimensional analysis is
very useful technique to show the relations among these three pro-
cesses. It enables simple and general estimates of performance, prior
to more detailed and time-consuming analyses for specific design
cases [282].

PBased on the fundamental similarity between diffusion of heat
and mass, correlations for Nusselt and Sherwood numbers (of the
kind shown in Table 5) are expected to be similar in forced convec-
tive flow. With the addition of buoyancy terms, Grashof number (Gr)
terms should be also be included [283]. If the Prandtl number (Pr)
and Schmidt number (Sc) are equal, then Nu D Sh. The ratio Sc/Pr,
called the Lewis number, is shown in Table 6 for trace gases of inter-
est, confirming that Le(cid:4)1. This means that measures to enhance
heat transfer (cid:1) such as extensions to surfaces or turbulence pro-
moters (cid:1) could be expected to increase Sh and Nu by the same per-
centage. For example, if the photocatalytic material were coated on
the ground surface of the collector, corrugations in the surface could
be useful to enhance both heat transfer to the air and the mass trans-
fer by similar amounts. On the other hand, the equivalence between
Nu and Sh is only valid to the extent that the same surfaces are being
used for both heat transfer and for photocatalysis. For example, it
could well be the case in practice that heat transfer occurs mainly at
the ground and photocatalysis at the glazed surface above.

PThe fact that, in the correlations of Table 5, Re is raised to a power
less than unity suggests a sub-linear dependence of heat and mass
transfer on flow velocity: a doubling in velocity would be expected
to increase heat and mass transfer by less than 2. We also note that,
since the characteristic length L appears in the numerator of Sh, a
decrease of L will help to achieve an increase in mass transfer in
inverse proportion to L at given Re. This is because the distance over
which molecules have to be transferred is decreased.

PMomentum transfer occurs through shear stress at flow bound-
aries. According to the Reynolds analogy, skin friction coefficient
(CDwall shear stress/r u2) and the Stanton number (St D h/r cp u)
assume proportionate values (r is air density, cp is heat capacity, u is

of dimensional analysis, Nu may be substituted by Sh with Pr substituted by Sc.

suggesting that St and C will increase proportionately with changes
to geometry or dimensions. With the mass transfer coefficient
K D Sh.D/H and following again the simplification due to Le(cid:4)1, pro-
vides the approximation of St (cid:4) K/u. The appearance of u2 in the
denominator of C, in contrast to u in the denominator of St, suggests
that for given C and St, lowering of u will result in a large reduction
of wall shear stress accompanied by only modest penalty in K. There-
fore, to mitigate potential conflict between maximizing mass trans-
fer and minimizing pressure drop, we should choose a large contact
area of catalyst (to maximize the action area of action for both K and
C) and small u to give low C (a similar principle to that used in a
micro-channel heat exchanger). This would be favored by position-
ing any additional photocatalytic surfaces away from regions of
higher flow velocity, that is to say away from regions near the center
of the solar collector or in the vicinity of the turbine and chimney
inlet. To minimize u, additional surfaces could be positioned instead
towards the outer rim of the solar collector (as in Fig. 11).

PThe Reynolds analogy is only applicable when flow resistance is
dominated by skin friction and not by profile drag [281,283]. Profile
drag is induced by pressure variations against bluff surfaces facing
the flow, asymmetries, or separation of flows behind surfaces. Pho-
tocatalytic surfaces in the solar collector should therefore be aerody-
namically designed to minimize profile drag, if such drag is found to
be significant in magnitude.

PBased on the above considerations, a preliminary dimensional
analysis of the effectiveness of a SCPP as a photocatalytic reactor is
presented in Table 7 below, based on the assumption that the floor
of the solar collector is coated with catalyst to provide zero concen-
tration of methane at this boundary. Accordingly, the estimate
Sh D Nu D 1340 enables a mass transfer coefficient K D 0.0166 m s¡1
to be calculated readily, resulting in a number of mass transfer units
of 1.1, and mass transfer effectiveness of a 67% (cid:1) indicating that two
out of every three molecules of methane entering the SCPP would be
removed.

PThe calculation ignores the issue that coating the floor with
TiO2 would increase the reflectivity and reduce the optical
absorption and thus solar collector efficiency. More realistically,
the TiO2 would be applied to the underside of the glazing. None-
theless, this would provide the same surface area subject to sim-
ilar mass transfer regime. Therefore, subject to the assumed
condition of zero concentration at the flow boundary, the calcu-
lation gives a preliminary indication that a reasonable photo-
catalytic performance is possible, and that further study and
optimization is justified.

P5.3.3. Quantitative experimental studies of PCR performance

PLiu et al [239] conducted photochemical reactions in a 64 mm
diameter cylindrical reactor of 530 mm length (total volume 1.7 l,
effective volume of 1.4 l). The C-TiO2 coated 0.18 mm thick alumin-
ium sheet used (440 mm length - 201 mm height) was attached
closely on the interior reactor surface.

PWith an initial concentration 9 mg m¡3 of CH4, at a flow rate
8 L min¡1, 50% CH4 removal rate was obtained (4.5 mg m¡3 min¡1)
with the C-TiO2 photocatalyst using 15 W UV lamps (185 nm and
254 nm), with a relative humidity of nearly 30%. These laboratory
scale experiments using a “small” reactor were interestingly done in
a continuous flow reactor. At a 8 L min¡1 flow rate, the CH4 flux
speed is 2,5 m min¡1 (0.15 km h¡1), corresponding to about 10 s gas
residence time in the reaction zone.

PThe photocatalytic CH4 decomposition performance of vertically
aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays grown by a one-step anodic oxidation
technique was reported by In, et al. [286]. At typical experimental
conditions, 2 vol% of CH4 gas (in a 2:5 gas mixture of He and atmo-
spheric air), through the reaction zone the gas flow is around 6 £
1015 molcules s¡1, corresponding to about 1 s gas residence time in
the reaction zone.

PPhotocatalytic measurements were carried out under UV irradia-
tion at 367 nm (410 mW cm¡2, 250 mW total power). The optimal
nanotube photocatalyst thickness for CH4 oxidation under 367 nm
illumination was estimated by the authors to be about 575 nm. The
CH4 conversion was about 24 £ 10¡9 mmol s¡1 (1.4 £ 1013 CH4 s¡1)
and the absorbed photon to product conversion efficiency obtained
by the authors was about 2.5 £ 10¡4 CO2 molecules per photon.

PNielsen et al. [287] studied the total oxidation of CH4 in a micro-
reactor of 240 nl allowing experiments to be carried out at 1 bar
with 2% CH4 in air on small amounts of catalyst (ranging from 10 to
350 mg) with on the order of 5.109 molcules/s and a residence time
of 1 s.

PWith the assumption that the height of the entrance of the GH of
a SCPP is 3 m, the air flow speed under the GH is nearly 3 m s¡1 (for
an air flow speed of 15 m s¡1 inside the tower at the turbines). The
gas residence time in the reaction zone is about 833 s (almost
14 min) if the photocatalysts covers 20 km2, to be compared to about
1 s in the case of Nielsen et al. [287], and to about 10 s for Liu et al.
[239]. If the height at the entrance of the collector is higher (Figs. 10,
11 and 13), the air flow speed is lower and the gas residence time in
the reaction zone is longer.

PTaranto [288] compared the photocatalytic efficacy of two types
of photocatalytic purifiers under development for treating gaseous
effluents employing TiO2-coated materials either as planar or folded
fibrous filters, or as honeycomb monoliths. Taranto tested a 0.4 m3
closed-loop, air tight, photocatalytic reactor with a loop through
which the airflow can go from 16 to 1800 m3/h. This reactor com-
prised a parallelepiped accommodating alternate banks of U-shaped
lamps emitting at 254 nm and TiO2 coated-materials. Methanol was
chosen as the test pollutant, because contrary to CH4 it is easily min-
eralized and two materials were tested: (i) a thin, folded tissue
impregnated with commercial TiO2 and colloidal SiO2 used as a
binder and (ii) an aluminum honeycomb-shaped material coated
with the same commercial TiO2. The interest of using honeycomb

PSeveral other alternatives during night time have been proposed
like non-CO2 GHGs adsorption on a substrate (metal organic frame-
works, zeolites, activated carbon, sands. . .), taking advantage of
reduced temperatures and reduced airspeed at night, with possible
desorption during the day when sunlight activates the photocatalyst
and increasing temperature releases the pollutant from the adsorp-
tion substrate.

PMOFs are studied for methane storage and delivery [290], while
the CH4 adsorption capacity of carbonaceous solids is studied like
for granular activated carbon (3.21 mol kg¡1) and wood-derived bio-
chars (0.05(cid:1)0.9 mol kg¡1) [291]. Some decomposition at room tem-
perature of HFCs and CFCs upon adsorption over zeolites was
discovered by Hannus [292]. According to Saha et al. [293], zeolite
5A is a good adsorbent to remove CO2 and N2O from air, meanwhile
to remove CH4 from air the metal organic framework MOF-177 is
the adsorbent of choice. The potential of soils as a sink of CFCs was
demonstrated by Khalil and Rasmussen [294] and by Benzoni [295].
Four sands from different locations (Mecca, Oman, Egypt and USA)
were studied by G€ab [296], together with alumina and molecular
sieves of known composition. Only modest mineralization of CCl2F2
was generally observed (0% to 9%) whatever the substrate, but 87%
CCl4 mineralization was obtained on basic alumina, 92% on neutral
alumina, 41% on molecular sieves (containing 32.2% A12O3, 38% SiO2
and K2O) and up to 46% CCl4 on Mecca sand (containing 13.6%
A12O3, 69.3% SiO2, and Fe2O3, CaO, NaO, MgO). The conclusion is that
some halocarbons can be mineralized on sand, on alumina and on
several metal oxides, even in the dark. As SCPPs are located in desert
regions, the natural sandy soil composition can therefore be of bene-
fit for GHGR.

6. Discussion

PThis review has been motivated by the limitations of current
approaches to tackling global warming. It has been argued that
hybrid SCPP-photocatalytic reactors present a possible complemen-
tary solution, alongside clean and efficient conversion technologies
and carbon capture and storage as discussed elsewhere [297(cid:1)299].

PHowever, though the landmark 50 kW prototype SCPP con-
structed in Spain enabled promising subsequent design studies
[300], the 4000-fold scale up to 200 MW is challenging. Scales of 200
MW (or even 400 MW) will be needed for significant contribution to
a solution, with airflow around 17 £ 109 m3 day¡1. In contrast, in the
largest laboratory scale photocatalytic reactions conducted for CH4
removal, the airflow rate was a mere 11.5 m3 day¡1 (8 L min¡1)
[239]. Can the methods proposed in this review article effectively
remove non-CO2 GHGs from the atmosphere at sufficient scale to
have an effect on global warming? Though it is too soon to answer
this question decisively, some interesting initial observations can be
made. In Section 5.3.2 we are able to extrapolate from the Manza-
nares trials a mass transfer effectiveness of 67%; in other words for
every 3 molcules of CH4 entering the reactor, 2 will get converted to
CO2 with relatively low GWP.

PIn a scenario where future energy needs of 10,000 GW were satis-
fied by 50,000 SCPPs each of 200 MW output (or 680 GWh, with 39%
capacity factor), close to one atmospheric volume would pass
through the SCPPs collectors every 15 years, which could help to
clean up indefinitely the atmosphere from several non-CO2 GHGs.
Making the assumption that the effectiveness of mass transfer
allows the elimination of 67% of the CH4, halocarbons and N2O in
the air flux under the PCR [115(cid:1)117, 239], each photocatalytic
SCPP can eliminate nearly 1000 kt eq-CO2 yr¡1, and avoid a further
600 ktCO2 yr¡1 of emissions (assuming a reference scenario in which
electricity is generated with carbon intensity of 0.88 tCO2 MWh¡1)

Fig. 14. Elemental mass transfer processes in the photocatalytic reactor (reproduced
from [154]).

Pshapes was clearly demonstrated by the considerable differences in
pressure drop between the two materials.

5.4. Materials, economics and nocturnal operation

PCommercial photocatalytic coatings or paints contain after appli-
cation 50 to 100 g m¡2 of nano-sized TiO2. Making the assumption of
using 1000 tons of photocatalyst (256 m3, as TiO2 density is nearly
3900 kg m¡3) in a single layer of 50 g m¡2, an area of 20 km2 can be
covered under the GH of a SCPP. If the photocatalyst is applied in the
centre of the GH, a radius of 2.5 km can be covered. At the current
prices of bulk nano-sized TiO2 (i.e. more or less USD $3300 per ton)
1000 tons represents USD$ 3(cid:1)4 million, the total cost of the coating
process can be estimated to USD$ 20 million, less than 2% of the cost
of the SCPP [289].

PNon-CO2 GHGs removal by photocatalysis has the potential to
provide not only significant climatic benefits by countering global
warming, but also environmental benefits as halocarbons and N2O
have deleterious effects on the ozone layer.

PThe driving parameters for a large scale PCR for atmospheric
remediation will be the visible light absorption for good solar
energy-conversion efficiencies and reaction rates, and the photoca-
talyst cost and lifetime. Of course many other important parameters
can be cited, like: flow rate, mass transfer rate, pressure drop, cata-
lyst amount, illuminated area, light efficiency, intrinsic reaction
kinetics, catalyst specific area and particle size, doping element or
co-catalyst if any, temperature, absorption wavelength, alkalinity,
etc.

PThe mineralization of N2O and CH4 (Eq. (1) and Eq. (3)) does not
produce deleterious by-products. The oxido-reduction of CFCs and
HFCs produces halo acids that can be neutralized by cheap alkalis
which can be part of the photocatalytic coating or of the SCPP soil.
But even with the assumptions that (i) 100% of the halogenated com-
pounds passing through the SCPP per year are destroyed, (ii) each
mole giving 4 mol of acids (although phosgene and chlorine gas are
also possible products) and (iii) that 100% of the halogenated acids
stay on the photocatalyst, deactivating it stoichiometrically by
adsorption or by reaction (metal oxides are alkalis), only 1/9 of the
TiO2 per year will be consumed.

PPhotocatalysed reactions can only be done when the photocataly-
sis are activated by light illumination. Under a SCPP they can only
take place during the day, but strategies have been proposed [33,34]
to overcome this restriction.

PUsing artificial illumination at night is not recommended due
to additional costs, although possible with low cost energy-saving
compact fluorescent lamps, which emit UV light, s converted

Por even 900 ktCO2 yr¡1 based on Australian carbon intensity [301],
thus helping to limit the Earth's temperature rise.

POne important question is safety and security of use. Photocataly-
sis has been shown to be a source of N2O (when starting from NOx)
[302] and incomplete oxidation of VOCs in terms of emissions of
harmful by-products (such as aldehydes) can be of concern, for
instance for the use of commercial photocatalytic air-purifiers sold
for indoors domestic use [154,303]. In all cases, the photocatalyst
has to be chosen for its activity but also its lowest side-reactions and
by-products. This review proposes to perform removal of GHGs in
very sparsely populated deserts, where there will be almost no VOCs
or NOx pollution. Often, intermediate by-products like aldehydes or
alcohols react more rapidly in the atmosphere with the °OH radical,
thus are more rapidly eliminated that the parent pollutant. In the
cases of methane, CFCs and HFCs, the reaction intermediates are the
same as the ones that currently arise from the natural oxidation pro-
cesses by the °OH radical, or by photolysis, thus no new risk is pre-
sented. Also all the products obtained will be released quite high in
the atmosphere by the chimney of the SCPP and with some kinetic
energy allowing them to go even higher, so the risks for life and
environment are lower than the advantages.

PAnother important question concerns whether the SCPP provides
an effective approach to contacting photocatalysts with the atmo-
sphere, compared to the other approaches reported in the literature.
For example, it is interesting to compare against the approach of Sto-
laroff [28] who proposed several geoengineering strategies like dis-
persion of catalytic aerosols in the atmosphere. We feel that
dispersion of aerosols would entail many governance issues, risking
unforeseen side effects, in common with atmospheric injection tech-
nologies suggested for SRM. Stolaroff thinks that industrial technolo-
gies cannot process of the order of 1/10 of the atmosphere each year.
This review suggests the contrary.

PDespite several drawbacks [304,305], some researchers [306,307]
have proposed the deliberate injection of titania or alumina particles
into the stratosphere to scatter solar radiation back to space as a pos-
sible climate engineering scheme. But global warming is caused by
longwave radiation, thus reducing the shortwave radiation will not
solve the problem; neither will it reduce ocean acidification. This
review paper proposes to address the underlying causes of climate
change. Reducing the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere allows
more thermal energy to escape to the outer space: this mitigation
strategy, called Earth Radiation Management by Ming [308], is not
SRM [309]. SRM by stratospheric sulphate aerosols might increase
the ozone hole, or might delay its recovery, while N2O, CFCs and
HFCs removal by SCPPs-PCRs might decrease the ozone hole and
provide both health and financial benefits [310].

PBased on the important urban photocatalytic experiments of Folli
[136] and some others, as analyzed by Kleffmann [159], some points
can be made:

P(cid:3) for NOx degradation, the photocatalyst employed in those
experiments was only active under UV, meanwhile for CH4 total
oxidation and for the removal of the other non-CO2 GHGs it is
proposed to use photocatalysts active under both UV and visible
light, taking profit of a larger range of the sunlight energy;

P(cid:3) the irradiation for NOx degradation was of 3 W m¡2 [136] and
0.6 or 1.6 W m¡2 [140,156]; while under a SCPP it will be of
600(cid:1)800 W m¡2, more than two orders of magnitude larger,
with UV intensity in the order of 30 W m¡2; suggesting that the
SCPP-PCR will not fail due to insufficient radiation;

P(cid:3) urban NOx photooxidation trials were performed inside cities
and there are many shadows of buildings (or even of the cars,
buses and trucks passing on the streets), thus, as illustrated in
fig. 4, the illumination of the photocatalyst is not constant; while
under a SCPP the daily illumination of the collector is permanent

Pand more intense (excepting the shadow from the chimney and
sometimes from clouds);

P(cid:3) the NOx concentration at vehicles’ exhaust is high and dilution
occurs rapidly with distance, thus there is a gradient that could
impair performance; while concentration of well mixed GHGs in
the atmosphere is considered constant, making for consistent
performance of the SCPP-PCR;

P(cid:3) in an urban environment, the air speed varies with crosswind
direction and the turbulences close to passing vehicles (buses,
trucks, cars) at different speeds is important and variable; while
under the SCPP collector the air flow will be almost constant
over all the area of the photocatalyst coating;

P(cid:3) on the canyon street the photocatalyst was only on the side-
walks at the bottom near the road; on the tunnel the photocata-
lyst was only at the top of the walls and on the ceiling; while
under a SCPP the photocatalyst is proposed on both ground and
canopy;

P(cid:3) the area of the UV active photocatalyst used in Folli experiments
was not sufficient (400 m2) to transform significant amounts of
the pollutant targeted, while for the SCPP-PCR proposal it is in
excess (20 km2), 50,000 times larger.

PIn SCPP-PCR, several tons of photocatalytic materials are pro-
posed to be used under intense sunlight to destroy ppb levels of CH4,
N2O and p.p.t. levels of halocarbons.

PIn fact, whereas the SCPP-PCR has certain distinct advantages
over the urban photocatalysis approaches; it can also be argued that
it follows the recommendations following from such experiments.
The international team that conducted the field campaigns in one
Brussels tunnel and in a model street canyon [140,156] made “rec-
ommendations for the proper use of photocatalytic materials, such as:

P1. optimized application of the photocatalytic coating on a regular
substrate, in order to obtain a low surface roughness minimizing
dust adsorption;

P2. high UV light intensity levels ideally around 10 W/m2, to avoid

surface passivation;

P3. adequate design of the illumination system (visible plus UV
light), to reach acceptable investments in terms of cost-benefit
ratio;

P4. low average relative humidity of tunnel air (<60%);
P5. high photocatalytic activity of the de-polluting material, with a
photocatalytic deposition velocity for NO of at least 0.1 cm/s
measured under tunnel conditions;

P6. low average tunnel wind speed, for increased reaction time of

pollutants;

P7. two-way tunnels, for increased reaction time and turbulent mix-

ing;

P8. high active surface-to-volume ratio (smaller-sized tunnel
tubes); in absolute terms, the length of the tunnel should be
adequate to have an appreciable de-pollution effect.”

PTaking these recommendations one by one, it can be noted that:
(1) the canopy cover of the SCPP is a smooth and flat ceiling with
low roughness and the gravity prevents dusts deposition in the inner
part; (2 & 3) the sunlight visible-light intensity under a SCPP will be
almost 2 orders of magnitude larger as the UV intensity recom-
mended in these publications; and (4) the humidity level is by defi-
nition quite low in hot and arid countries. The photocatalytic surface
passivation by urban VOC pollutants will be several orders of magni-
tude lower in the deserts where SCPP can be installed and CH4 total
photooxidation and N2O photoreduction are not supposed to pro-
duce by-products; the acids by-products of the photocatalytic
oxido-reduction of halogenated compounds can easily be neutral-
ized and, their amount is limited, as Montreal gases concentration in
level. Regarding point (5), the
the atmosphere is at the p.p.t.

Pproposed photocatalysts are active both under UV and visible-
it is possible to optimize the airflow
light. Regarding (6 & 7),
speed under the GH of a SCPP by varying the collectors entrance
height; the GHG reactants are already well mixed and the flow is
turbulent, and can be optimized [311]. The long reaction time of
pollutants, and (8) the high active surface-to-volume ratio,
is
likely to be the case for 200 MW SCPPs with a greenhouse cover
radius of 3.5 km and the photocatalyst coating covering a radius
of about 2.5 km (20 km2).

PThe photocatalytic deposition velocity for N2O, CH4, and of every
individual CFC and HFC, has still to be measured for the non-CO2
GHGs targeted in this review [312,313] and is part of the urgently
research needed to go further in future with the SCPP-PCR open per-
spectives to slow down global warming and to fight climate change.
PClearly there are also disadvantages of SCPP-PCRs compared to
urban photocatalysis. The latter generally make use of existing struc-
tures, as such are expected to be of lower cost, be less visually intru-
sive, and have lower environmental impact in their construction.
The Life Cycle Assessment of SCPP will be an important topic for
further work.

PBefore implementation, field studies are necessary to validate
and understand better how photocatalytic coatings under a SCPP
collector will perform under real-world conditions.

PFuture research does not need to start by building a large
SCPP, as PCR can start by being tested in existing structures
which have to deal with larger GHGs concentrations, for instance
photocatalytic CH4 total oxidation from coal mine ventilation,
although according to some articles, photocatalysis works better
at low concentrations [118]. Future research can also focus on
other GHGs photocatalytic removal, such as ventilation of green-
houses used in agriculture where sewage sludge from treatment
plants or pig manure are drying; then by measuring the amount
of some other GHGs inside and outside large agricultural green-
houses, after passing through a large surface area of photocata-
lyst exposed to sunlight
[289]. These applications provide
economic incentives in themselves to perform the photocatalytic
tests and then construct some pilot plants. Estimating the scal-
ability of the process will then be possible.

PSome further possible benefits of photocatalytic removal of non-

CO2 GHGs from the atmosphere may be mentioned.

P1. Simultaneous removal of ozone depleting substances, through
elimination of residual CFCs being phased out by the Montreal
protocol. The benefits of the photocatalytic removal of non-
CO2 GHGs from the atmosphere are not limited to tackling
global warming. Environment Canada estimated in 1997
[310] that, by the year 2060, the economic benefits of the
Montreal protocol will totalize $459 billion, for a cost of
$235 billion to achieve CFC phase-out. For atmospheric
clean-up, the use of SCPP-PCR may provide benefits of com-
parable value. The benefits of the Montreal protocol [314]
came from reduced UV damage to fisheries, agriculture and
materials like outdoors plastics and paints. The decreased
health care costs savings were not evaluated, but the number
of fewer cases of cataracts, melanoma and non-melanoma
skin cancer and deaths worldwide were estimated. Accelerat-
ing the removal of halocarbons from the atmosphere, as well
as the removal of N2O (a powerful ozone layer depleting
compound) will provide similar benefits for the ozone layer
as well as for climate and human, animal and vegetal health
is also affected by global warming. Clearly there are also
some downsides and risks to the SPCC-PCR concept. For
example, mineralization of halogenated compounds produces
acids that might have to be neutralized, but CFCs and HFCs
concentration in the atmosphere is more than 5 orders of

Pmagnitude lower than CO2 concentration, thus easier to deal
with and to manage.

P2. Positive feedback in decreasing methane lifetime. As the concen-
tration of methane will be lower, its atmospheric lifetime will
decrease, and thus the amount of °OH radical will increase (IPCC
AR5 [315]: a 1% increase in CH4 leads to a 0.32% decrease in
°OH), making it available for the destruction of other GHGs in
the troposphere, like HFCs. The °OH radical is also called the
detergent of the atmosphere as many anthropogenic and bio-
genic chemicals emitted into the atmosphere do not reach the
stratosphere, thanks to their reaction with °OH that breaks them
down efficiently. Recently Howarth [316] wrote that by reduc-
ing CH4 emissions, society buys some critical decades of lower
temperatures, as the climate system responds much more
quickly to reducing CH4 than to CO2. Howarth said: “society
needs to wean itself from the addiction to fossil fuels as quickly as
possible. . . . We should embrace the technologies of the 21st century
and convert our energy systems to ones that rely on wind, solar and
water power.” SCPPs together with photocatalysis could help to
reach this goal.

7. Conclusion

PThis review shows that a large scale method of removal of GHGs
other than CO2 is possible, as these GHGs can be mineralized by pho-
tocatalysis, using simple metal oxides like MgO or ZnO, cheap TiO2
derivatives and zeolites.

PA giant PCR supported by the infrastructure of a SCPP is proposed

as a device able to:

P(cid:3) transform CH4 into CO2 which has GWP >10 times lower per

mole on a 100 years’ basis;

P(cid:3) transform several CFCs and HFCs into CO2 C HCl and HF and neu-

tralize the halo-acids by-products;

P(cid:3) reduce the atmospheric concentrations of CH4, N2O and halocar-

bons, thus achieving GHG removal;

P(cid:3) require minimum additional investment for the PCR.

PThe development perspectives are promising, as each 200 MW

SCPP can at the same time:

P(cid:3) produce annually 680 GWh of non-intermittent renewable elec-
tricity, preventing from 0.6 to 0.9 million tons of CO2 emissions
per year [301];

P(cid:3) and allow negative emissions energy production thanks to the

PCR.

PSCPP-PCR is a negative emissions technology which might help to
fight global warming and tackle climate change by preventing or
removing nearly 1600 ktons eq-CO2 yr¡1 (for each 200 MW plant).
Advances in photocatalysis science and technology, as well as in
industrial applications, point out the promising potential of photoca-
talysis for reducing the levels of GHGs in the atmosphere, with a pos-
itive impact on climate change effects.

PScale up to 200 MW is highly challenging, in terms of the techno-
economic risks involved: 200 MW is a 4000 times larger than the
largest SCPP prototype built to date. Beyond that, however, risks and
uncertainties will be more manageable (cid:1) as the system is essentially
modular and the process of replication up to say several 1000 SCPPs
would benefit from a learning curve. Though costly, SCPPs can also
provide socio-economic benefits in developing countries, mainly by
using local raw materials: desert sand for the glass canopy, cement
and iron for the chimney. They could help to create employment and
economic investment in sunny countries that have growing popula-
tions and fragile economies. Unlike a number of SRM technologies,

PSCPPs do not require aerospace or ballistics technology (cid:1) as such
they are relatively free from concerns about militarization.

PUnlike sequestration approaches (CCS, BECCS, DAC), non-CO2
GHGs removal by SCPPs-PCRs does not require gas capture, purifica-
tion, compression, and transport (cid:1) avoiding the risks associated
with these processes and avoiding the costs associated to disposal or
sequestration of CO2: no disposal is required for non-CO2 GHGR.

PNon-CO2 GHGs have poor to no-utility in the atmosphere; remov-
ing part of them to cool the Earth will have few drawbacks. Whereas
maintaining relatively elevated levels of CO2 might have positive
effects on photosynthesis of some plants and crops species (although
in a warmer world there will be a limit to such benefits [317]). Thus
non-CO2 GHG removal is complementary with CDR [39,245].

PEmissions must fall to zero to stabilize the global climate (Fig. 1)
and achieve 'net zero' or 'climate neutrality' by the second half of
the century [10]. Among the many measures on the table to achieve
these goals that are discussed in this paper, one has further attrac-
tion not already mentioned, which is the ease of monitoring the
changes in atmospheric concentrations it provides. Sensors installed
at the inlets and outlets of the SCPPs would give real-time informa-
tion on removal rates, essential for verification and economic justifi-
cation of such measures in future implementation schemes for GHG
reduction. Last but not least, in case of destabilization of methane
hydrates [318,319], SCPPs-PCRs can destroy CH4 and thus be an
insurance in the future to prevent a potential climate tipping point
[320].

PIt is the authors’ opinion that instead of SRM, ground level meth-
ods for removing GHGs other than CO2 from the atmosphere should
be quickly brought into the climate policy debate, as they add vital
flexibility to the efforts to tackle climate change at the needed scale.
