Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a promising technology for automotive applications.
To achieve the cost versus durability required for the commercialization of this technology, material pro-
duction and its associated challenges have gained much interest. To reduce the production time per fuel
cell stack, it is important to increase the number of units produced. A time-consuming step in the pro-
duction of stacks is the activation, also known as break-in, which is necessary to carry out a subsequent
factory-acceptance-test. The state-of-the-art studies found in literature are mainly tailored towards inves-
tigating various break-in procedures without taking into consideration the possible mechanisms behind
the performance increase during the initial operation. This interconnection between break-in procedures
and physical phenomena is hence missing. In this review, we describe the optimized state for the mem-
brane and catalyst layer in regards to their morphology and composition. We compare this to the known
state after production and discuss which mechanisms change the initial state. This information is then
used to put into perspective the mechanisms that improve the cell performance and the time scale on
which they will take place. Despite the high dependency of the activation behavior on the production
steps and the material used, we can conclude that the main sluggish activation mechanisms for state-of-
the-art CCMs are the removal of solvents from production and changes in the catalyst layer ionomer and
at the membrane surface. Membrane bulk protonic conductivity and changes in platinum structure are
expected to have a subordinate role in the activation process. High humidities or even liquid water in the
cell and the cycling between oxidizing and reducing conditions at the electrodes accelerate the activation
process. Thus, this review serves the development of “smart” and “fast” break-in procedures.

1. Introduction

The Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell has received
much attention in the past years due to its role in a diverse energy
economy.  By  converting the chemical energy stored in  hydrogen
via an electrochemical reaction into electricity, PEM fuel cells are
an attractive technology for automotive applications. The knowl-
edge that during the initial operation of the cell, the cell’s perfor-
mance increases until it reaches a constant level, indicating that
the fuel cell is activated, is as old as the fuel cell itself. This pro-
cess of performance improvement is presented in Fig. 1 for four
different activation methods and is widely known as ”break-in”.

All  graphs  show  the  increase  of  the  power  density  response
up  to  a  certain  value,  where  it  stabilizes,  also  called  Begin-of-
Life (BoL). The duration from the first operation until the BoL is
reached is defined as the break-in time. The duration of this acti-
vation differs in the presented cases from below one hour up to
more than 20 hours for the same material. Other terms, such as
”conditioning” and ”incubation” are sometimes also used, but these
can be ambiguous, since they can also be used to describe recovery
procedures to reduce reversible losses or, in research, to ensure re-
producible conditions for measurements. Hence in this review pa-
per the designation ”break-in” or ”activation” will be used here-
inafter and refers to the treatment just before begin of life. This
treatment refers to the first operation of a fuel cell, directly after
its production, on a test bench up to a stable performance. This
”activation” process can also indicate any ex-situ pretreatments or
combinations of methods that are often applied to the individual
layers of the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA). On commer-
cial blank membranes or Catalyst Coated Membrane (CCM) ex-situ
pretreatments (e.g. boiling in water) are usually carried out before
delivery [4] and therefore, they show a different break-in behavior
to  untreated  materials.  In  this  review,  we  consider  the  resulting
distinctions regarding the adjustment of activation methods for re-
search and industry during break-in procedure.

The  investigation  on  activation  procedures  for  the  individual
components like the platinum catalyst or the polymer electrolyte
membrane were explored at an early stage [5–8,10,9] . The studies
of break-in procedures, specially on fuel cell MEA, taking the in-
teraction between the different components into account and us-
ing in-situ strategies for activation, started about two decades ago
[11,12] , followed by several patents on break-in methods and sys-
tems [13–17] . Yuan et al. [18] summarized the knowledge about
break-in in a review from 2011 with focus on strategies and sys-
tems to reduce the time required for activation. An important con-
clusion of this review is the recognition that strategy-focused re-
search on break-in is reaching its limits and that more in-depth

investigation of the mechanisms is needed to prove the hypothe-
ses  that  have  been  put  forward  so  far.  Another  study  giving  an
overview  about  the  state  of  knowledge  is  from  2013  from  Zhi-
ani  et  al.  [19] .  They  summarized  constant  voltage,  constant  cur-
rent and potential cycling activation procedures and compared the
three most common methods. They concluded that constant cur-
rent activation does not reach the performance of constant voltage
and potential cycling activation, pointing out that the main acti-
vation mechanisms are membrane hydration and removal of im-
purities from the catalyst sites. Additionally they measured irre-
versible  changes  in  the  MEA  interfacial  structure  and  concluded
performance and durability effects initiated by the break-in pro-
cedure. Table 1 lists strategy focused break-in studies, separated in
strategies carried out on a fuel cell test bench (in-situ) and with-
out a fuel cell test bench (ex-situ), which is the main determining
factor in regards to the test bench capacity and design.

The duration of the different break-in strategies must be treated
with caution, as the methods sometimes need to be supplemented
by further break-in steps or the state of activation is not presented
in the study. The comparison therefore cannot be easily done. Nev-
ertheless, the power density before and after activation that were
available for in-situ activation methods are presented in Fig. 2 .

The comparison shows that cells with a very low power den-
sity in the beginning often achieve higher performance increase.
This could arise due to impurities and structural defects that have
to  be  removed  or  improved.  Cells  with  a  higher  power  density
before any activation took place could be produced in a cleaner
and  more  optimized  way.  Furthermore  the  investigated  material
plays  a  decisive  role.  The  studies  that  have  provided  material
data primarily used Nafion®112 or Nafion®212 as membrane ma-
terial,  which  both  have  a  thickness  of  50.8μm  and  platinum  on
carbon  as  catalyst  with  platinum  loadings  ranging  from  0.05  to
0.4mg/cm 2 .  For  further  information  please  check  the  references
listed. Table 1 showed that many patents have been drafted in rela-
tion to break-in, underlining the importance of this procedure. This
is due to the fact that the activation is necessary for passing the
factory acceptance test that must be carried out for every fuel cell
stack before its delivery to the customer. Factory acceptance tests
are developed by every manufacturer and are contractually agreed
with the customer, to prove that the unit meets certain require-
ments of its specification. The IEC 62282-2-100:2018 [42] standard,
shown in Table 2 , can serve as a guideline, since it describes rou-
tine testing that must be performed on every produced unit, and a
proposal for an acceptance test.

The report from the company Strategic Analysis describes the
system test as a short ”ten-minute system functionality and perfor-
mance test” [43] , assuming that multiple hours of stack condition-

ing are sufficient for a comprehensive performance approval. For
their calculations, two hours of conditioning are targeted, which
also  contain  the  factory  acceptance  test.  A  report  from  Strategic
Analysis estimates the impact of ”stack conditioning” on the stack
manufacturing machinery capital costs with 5.37% at a quantity of
50 0,0 0 0 systems/year, which is slightly below the membrane pro-
duction cost estimations and therefore a significant cost factor [43] .
However, support infrastructure, buildings and installation are not
included in the calculations and increase with the parallelization
of manufacturing lines, which is needed to reach a high through-
put. The report estimates a parallelization of 22 process trains for
break-in.

As shown already in Table 1 , common practice is the activation
by operating the stack on a test bench with hydrogen and specific
load cycles, which leads to additional costs due to hydrogen and
energy consumption. Latest patents provide procedures of 90 min
up to four hours [35,40] and the interest in saving hydrogen con-
sumption, by using low currents or recycling H 2  that evolves on
the cathode during the H 2 pumping process, grows. The need for
a fast activation process not on stack, but rather on the cell level
is growing as quality control during production becomes more im-
portant as production capacity increases. Since the manufacturing
of MEA happens on a roll-to-roll machine, the batches produced
have to be tested before their assembly into the stack. This can be
done by testing parameters such as some CL properties (e.g. thick-
ness) or imaging techniques to check for holes and imperfections
[44–47] . On the other side, a fast performance check on this level

could combine different quality tests and needs a quick activation
method.

Since the recognition that more in-depth studies are necessary,
studies  with  advanced  electrochemical  analysis  have  been  con-
ducted with partly contradictory conclusions. Silva [22,24] inves-
tigated an increase of the Electrochemical Surface Area (ECSA) and
activity, while Kabir et al. [29] measured the reduction of the area
and an increase in the mean platinum particle size. The use of dif-
ferent materials, activation methods and the timing for measure-
ments could be decisive for these differences and therefore, the ne-
cessity for further studies is highlighted. Another important aspect
in fuel cell development is its lifetime. During the initial operation
of the cell, contaminants from production have to be removed and
irreversible changes to the nanostructure and the morphology of
the MEA are expected and are believed to affect the durability of
the cell. Taghiabadi et al. [30] investigated the influence of two dif-
ferent activation methods on the fuel cell durability and concluded
that low current operation, compared to constant voltage break-
in, causes higher degradation, due to Pt agglomeration and con-
sequently, higher decrease of electrochemical active surface area.
Balogun et al. [1] compared four activation methods namely, cath-
ode starvation, the conditioning procedure from The United States
Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  [2] ,  the  conditioning  protocol  from
the European Joint Research Center (JRC) [3] and an amperometric
conditioning protocol with regards to activation time, peak perfor-
mance and influence on degradation. From the study, the cathode
starvation method showed fastest activation within 40min, which
was explained by the reducing conditions at the cathode electrode
that were achieved by hydrogen evolution. Additionally, the high-
est ECSA values were measured and lowest membrane resistances
achieved. Simultaneously, cathode starvation resulted in the lowest
performance losses of 15% after 9 0 0 0 accelerated degradation cy-
cles, which was attributed mainly to the lowest ECSA losses. The
studies  show  that  there  is  a  correlation  between  activation  and
durability of a fuel cell, which must be closely investigated.

Further,  improper  activation  methods  could  lead  to  reduced
fuel cell performance and influence the comparability of materials.
Most  manufacturers  propose  break-in  methods,  adapted  to  their
material to achieve maximum performance. However, for the com-
mercialization  of  PEM  fuel  cells,  material  research  and  develop-
ment is in the forefront and hence, activation processes must be
adapted to ensure reliability of data within the shortest time possi-
ble. Currently, standard protocols for break-in procedures from the

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100924

DOE [2,48] and the JRC [3] , which follow an activation procedure
of up to 19 hours, are used. If the impact of activation would be
more highlighted and a higher transparency would be promoted, a
higher comparability and harmonization would be achieved [49] as
is the case partially, for example, for membrane pretreatment [50] .
This short introduction shows that break-in research in the past
decades was focused on different strategies and laid a foundation
for  further  research.  In  this  review,  we  summarize  the  state  of
knowledge of the mechanisms that appear during the break-in of
a PEM fuel cell. Since the knowledge about membrane morphol-
ogy, the structure of the catalyst layer, ionomer thin film forma-
tion  and  contamination  increased  during  the  last  years,  a  trans-
fer  to  propose  mechanisms  that  appear  during  break-in  is  pro-
vided.  Therefore  this  knowledge  is  used  to  describe  the  initial
state  of  different  com ponents  after  the  manufacturing  and  tar-
geted  conditions  for  optimum  performance  and  durability.  The
bridge  between  these  two  states  is  the  break-in  and  by  point-
ing  out  those  two  states,  a  theoretical  description  of  structural
changes that could appear during the break-in is possible. After-
wards processes that could be triggered by the operation of the
cell,  its  contact  with  different  media  like  hydrogen,  air  and  ni-
trogen  and  the  influence  of  temperature,  pressure  and  humid-
ity, which can contribute to structural changes, are described. The
knowledge about these possible processes is collected from all dif-
ferent areas of fuel cell and material research applied to under-
stand break-in. This knowledge can lead to an adaptation of pro-
duction processes that would either eliminate completely an in-
situ activation process or support the development of fast break-in
protocols.

2. Membrane activation

The polymer electrolyte membrane is sandwiched between the
catalyst layers of the anode and the cathode and acts as a separa-
tor. To ensure that the electrochemical reactions in the anode and
cathode compartments occur with as minimal losses as possible,
the membrane must, hence, be impermeable to the reactant gases
to reduce gas cross-over, have a high protonic conductivity to en-
sure  the  transport  of  protons  from  anode  to  cathode  and  be  an
electronic insulator. Further, to ensure the overall stability of the
cell, the membrane must withstand the harsh environment of the
cell. Hence, it must possess high chemical and mechanical stabil-
ity. These characteristics are typically achieved with a membrane
of Perfluorinated Sulfonic-Acid (PFSA) ionomer. These consist of a
hydrophobic backbone of tetrafluoroethylene repeat units and side
chains containing an ionic group (SO −
3 ) that forms the hydrophilic
part of the polymer. The polymer backbone serves as the mechan-
ical and chemical stabilizer, since it controls the thermal and me-
chanical  properties  of  the  ionomer.  A  cluster  of  these  chains  is
called a bundle and with higher ordering its crystallinity increases.
This crystalline structure hinders the dissolution in water and sta-
bilizes the membrane. The side chains with the sulfonyl hydrox-
ide end group determine the ion conductivity of the ionomer. The
sulfonic acid site is associated with a specific counterion. In a pro-
tonated state this means the interaction with oxonium, a proto-
nated water molecule. More active sites improve the water uptake,
which  leads  to  a  higher  ion  exchange  capacity  and  therefore,  a
higher proton conductivity. DOE sets a target for the proton con-
ductivity of 0.1S/cm at 120 ◦ C and 50% Relative Humidity (RH) [51] .
Nafion®reaches  this  conductivity  only  when  fully  hydrated  with
20  water  molecules  per  SO −
3  [51,52]  and  at  higher  temperatures
a full hydration is not established and the ionic conductivity de-
creases. Therefore, different side chain structures exist to reach a
high conductivity, while maintaining the chemical-mechanical sta-
bility. The ratio of stable backbone structure and conductive sul-
fonic  acid  groups  is  interlinked  in  the  Equivalent  Weight  (EW)

of  the  membrane,  which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  grams  poly-
mer  per  ionic  group.  With  an  increase  of  ionic  groups  for  the
same backbone and side chain structure, a lower EW is reached
and  the  proton  conductivity  is  enhanced.  Typical  ionomers  used
in  PEMFCs  and  their  chemical  structure  are  presented  in  Fig.  3
with typical EW, number of repeated units (m) and the presen-
tation  of  main  chain,  side  chain  and  end  group  [53] .  Short  Side
Chain (SSC) ionomers, such as, Aquivion®and Gore-SELECT TM have
gained much interest in the past years, due to their high chemical
stability at the various operating conditions in comparison to their
Long Side Chain (LSC) counterpart, Nafion®. Hence, in state-of-the-
art PEM fuel cells, they are not only used for membranes, but also
as binder and proton conductor in the CL [54] .

An  additional  strategy  to  increase  the  mechanical  stability  of
the membrane is the introduction of a chemical inert mechanical
support layer, known as reinforcement. The strategy is to prevent
multidimensional swelling by stabilizing the membrane in the in-
plane direction [55] , even though this leads to a swelling increase
in its thickness, which is easier to handle. State-of-the-art material
for a microporous reinforcement layer is expanded Polytetrafluo-
rethylen (PTFE), used for the Gore-SELECT TM membrane, manufac-
tured by W. L. Gore & Associates GmbH, filled with ionomer [56] .
Further,  the  chemical  stability  of  the  membrane  can  be  im-
proved with so called radical scavengers, like transition-metal ox-
ides,  which  neutralize  free  radicals,  like  hydroxyl  (OH)  and  hy-
droperoxyl  (HOO)  radicals,  before  they  decompose  the  ionomer
chains.  Common  chemical  stabilizers  are  cerium  and  manganese
oxide.  Their  use  has  already  been  shown  to  improve  the  mem-
brane’s tolerance towards radical attacks [57] .

The  two  main  manufacturing  processes  for  PFSA  membranes
are  melt-extrusion  and  solution  casting.  Nowadays  most  PFSA
membranes are solution casted to reach the desired low thickness
and  to  facilitate  the  insertion of  reinforcement material  and  ad-
ditives, like radical scavengers. Another reason is that melt extru-
sion with raw ionomer material in acid form is difficult to con-
duct due to strong interactions between the functional polymers
and the resulting viscosity [58] . If the membrane is produced with
basic  ionomer  material  in  fluorinated  -  hence  non-active  -  form
(SO 3 F), several post-treatments have to be carried out, like an acid
treatment  with  a  mixture  of  sulfuric  acid  and  deionized  water,
so that the sulfonic acid groups (SO 3 H) can form, which in turn
build  the  proton  conductive  end  group  as  shown  in  Fig.  3 .  The
hydrolysis  rate  through  the  membrane  is  about  1.3μm/min  at  a
temperature  of  75 ◦ C  [59] .  At  lower  temperatures  of  25 ◦ C  this
subsequent acidification can be about 30 times slower [60] . After-

wards possible cleaning processes can be carried out on the ac-
tivated membrane to remove dust particles or residues from pre-
vious production steps. The process with non-active start material
thus increases the complexity for the manufacturer. However, the
National  Research  Council  of  Canada  (NRC)  developed  a  promis-
ing process to melt-extrude PFSA ionomer in its acid form by us-
ing bifunctional additives [61] . Nevertheless, state-of-the-art mem-
branes like Gore-SELECT TM are still solution cast. For this process
optional steps after casting are also possible, like water washing to
remove washable additives [62] , boiling the membrane for 5min
in deionized-water at 98 ◦ C to hydrate the material [4] or cleaning
the membrane in diluted hydrogen peroxide to remove organic im-
purities [21] . At this point it is important to note that parameters
and details of PFSA membrane production of the main manufactur-
ers remain confidential. The pretreatments that are actually carried
out are therefore not completely known, which makes it difficult
to discuss the resulting effects on break-in. Toupin et al. [62] al-
ready pointed out some of these washing steps might not need to
be performed if the additives can be removed during the break-in
period.

Coating the CL directly on the membrane in an early stage of
the production process is another aspect that must be considered
when  investigating  the  membrane  as  it  reduces  substrate  mate-
rial  expenditure.  The  direct  coating  often  causes  problems,  due
to  membrane  swelling.  Wang  et  al.  [63]  found  that  the  coating
on K + form membranes reduces this swelling problem, neverthe-
less the additional step of hydrolysis, mentioned before, has to be
performed on the CCM. A new manufacturing approach was pre-
sented in 2017 by Gore in a technical report describing a direct-
coat MEA manufacturing process [48] . The catalyst ink is slot die
coated onto a low-cost backer and oven dried. A layer of ionomer
is directly coated onto the electrode and the reinforcement con-
sisting  of  ePTFE  is  inserted  into  the  moist  layer,  followed  by  an
oven drying step. The second electrode is then slot die coated onto
the membrane and dried at a moderate temperature. Two patents
updated this manufacturing approach by splitting the membrane
coating step into two layers with varying ionomer solution com-
positions  [64,65] .  The  first  protective  ionomer  layer  coated  onto
the electrode contains mainly water and ionomer and only a small
amount  of  water-insoluble  alcohol  to  prevent  the  ionomer  from
penetrating too deeply into the CL [43] . The second ionomer layer,
consisting  of  ionomer  and  expanded  PTFE,  is  applied  according
to the already known scheme. This new manufacturing approach
brings two aspects that should be considered when discussing the
activation processes. First, pretreatments that could be performed
on single membranes might be difficult to adjust to the MEA as
they could be harmful for the CL or do not reach the membrane
through the porous structure. Second, changing production param-
eters changes the behavior during break-in, such as water uptake,
that appears different for melt-extruded and solution cast mem-
branes [66] . In case of directly-coated MEA, a change in the inter-
connection between the membrane and the CL is likely, reducing
the contact resistance at the interface [67] .

It is known that during the casting process, the ionomer mate-
rial sees different temperatures, relative humidities and is in con-
tact  with  solvents,  additives  and  manufacturing  equipment  [68] .
The first two aspects can imprint a thermal history and a swelling
memory  onto  the  membrane  and  greatly  influence  its  structure
[69] . The break-in process possibly has to erase these memories
to  convert  the  membrane  structure  as  close  as  possible  to  the
best performing, but stable morphology. Besides the thermal and
humidity influences during production, contamination by metallic
ions, organic solvents or  further additives, which have to  be re-
moved to reach the conductivity and stability as desired, can ap-
pear. Hence, it is important to consider the effect of these aspects

on the performance of the membrane and their influence is dis-
cussed in the next sections.

2.1. Stressors for morphological changes

In general, changes in water concentration ( c w ) over time can

be calculated by Fick’s second law as follows:
d c w /d t = −∇ D

d (c w ) ∇ c w

(1)

d as the concentration-dependant dynamic diffusion coeffi-
with D
cient. Kusoglu [70] summarized D
d  values for Nafion membranes
from  several  studies  resulting  in  a  wide  range  of  10 −8  to  10 −6
cm 2 /s corresponding to the range of measurement methods and
experimental parameters. One major impact on this coefficient is
the mass transfer coefficient k m  that correlates to the fraction of
hydrophilic groups at the membrane surface. Due to the decisive
impact of the membrane surface, this effect is further discussed
in section 2.1.2 . For thin membranes the membrane thickness ( L )
is  used  as  characteristic  length  for  the  characteristic  time  con-
stant for diffusion τ
d . For a state-of-the-art membrane of
15μm, the time constant would range between several seconds up
to about 4min. When several diffusion processes have to be com-
bined,  their  impact  on  the  diffusion  coefficient  has  to  be  calcu-
lated. An empirical approach by adding up different time constants
for each process (m) and weighing them with the factor A m sim-
plifies the calculation of the increase of the membrane mass from
the initial ( M 0 ) to the current state ( M(t) ) [50] . Relative to the mass
increase until steady-state ( M ∞ - M 0 ), the water uptake can be cal-
culated following:
M(t) − M 0
M ∞ − M 0

A m exp(− t

For pristine membranes, further processes, like relaxation of poly-
mer backbones or domain spacing, could dominantly affect the wa-
ter uptake, which would result in an up to three order of magni-
tude slower transport process [71,72] . This difference in time scales
is, why not only the water uptake, but the stressors that could ac-
celerate or slow down morphological changes have to be consid-
ered.

A certain microstructural orientation in the polymer is needed
to increase its stability. This is reached by the directional arrange-
ment of the backbone. However, a tilting point, which results in an
anisotropy of elastic and plastic deformability, usually exists. This
point is undesirable since it could lead to high uniaxially swelling
[73] . The objective is, hence, to find the right amount of the coex-
istence of amorphous and crystalline parts.

In  addition,  uniaxially  oriented  polymers  show  an  increased
ionic conductivity parallel to the alignment [74] , while it may be
assumed that the orientation of ionic channels should be perpen-
dicular  towards  the  membrane  surface  to  shorten  the  route  for
protons to cross the membrane. The interconnection between the
emerging ionic domains should be high to reach a good and ho-
mogeneous ionic conductivity in the membrane [54] . Distances be-
tween the sulfonate groups should be minimized by increasing the
size of the water domains to optimize the electrostatic interaction
between the ion conducting groups and the protons and therefore,
minimize the energy barrier for the proton transport [75] . At the
same time a low hydrogen cross-over must still be ensured.

Material  characteristics  like  equivalent  weight,  side  chain
length, crystallinity, scavengers and reinforcements determine the
membrane morphology and the impact of the post-treatments af-
ter the production. The main external factors that are known to
change the morphology of a membrane, referred to ’transition fac-
tors’ hereinafter, are (i) water content, (ii) environmental contact,
(iii) temperatures, (iv) current flow and (v) mechanical treatment.

The possible transitions resulting from extrinsic treatments are de-
scribed  below.  It  is  important  to  understand  these  influences  in
order to interpret processes that appear under different break-in
approaches. For every transition factor, the known treatments for
activation are listed and discussed.

2.1.1. Water content

Hydration of the membrane is an important property to con-
sider,  when  investigating  chemical  or  physical  processes,  which
occur  during  break-in  [11,22,25,32,9,17] .  Zhiani  et  al.  [76]  com-
pared  the  cell  performance  during  activation  for  an  unsteamed
MEA and one with injection of steam to the anode and cathode
side. The results from the polarization curve and the Electrochem-
ical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) that were measured during the
activation are presented in Fig. 4 .

The cells were operated at constant voltage and with potential
cycles in between until no further performance increase was visi-
ble. As it can be seen, the steamed MEA reaches a power density
that is not achieved by the unsteamed MEA and the high frequency
resistance, that describes mainly the membrane resistance is lower
for the steamed MEA even after completed activation. This shows
the impact of a high water content during activation. Although one
must be careful in interpreting the impedance spectrum of the un-
steamed MEA, where a high mass transfer resistance arc is visible.
Any small mass transfer problems could distort the results. The in-
fluence on break-in time is shown in Fig. 5 showing the current
density during activation for a five-cell stack with and without pre-
treatment measured by Anderson [17] .

The pretreatment was performed by steaming the MEA in an
autoclave  with  saturated  steam  at  121 ◦ C.  The  hollow  symbols
show  the  pretreated  and  the  filled  symbols  show  the  untreated
MEA with its standard deviation. The results show a slightly faster
performance increase in the first hour for the pretreated MEA and
a  better  performance  at  low  current  densities.  This  can  be  ex-
plained by the higher water production at higher current densi-
ties, that masks any improvements by the pretreatment. The large
standard deviation for the untreated stacks shows that these re-
sults should be treated with caution. A reduction of the membrane

resistance of 40 and 62.5% after activation of 6hours and 40min
respectively was measured for Nafion membranes with a thickness
of 50 and 25.4μm [1,24] , but time rates for the hydration of thin-
ner membranes during activation are still missing. With increasing
water content, the proton conductivity increases and is therefore a
decisive parameter for the fuel cell performance. Different models
of the ionomer structure changing with increasing water content
exist [77–81] . Schmidt-Rohr [82] attracted high interest with their
simulation of different geometric ideal water domain models to in-
terpret several Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) data. The best
matching structural model was the parallel cylinder model, where
the backbone built reverse micelle cylinder with ionic side chains
oriented inwards facing the water channel. Kreuer [83] discussed
this cylinder model and concluded deviating real water contents
lead to a misinterpretation and demonstrated instead a morphol-
ogy  of  locally  flat  water  domains  with  a  width  of  around  1nm
separating polymer layers. Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)  measurements  confirm  this  3-D  morphology  of  intercon-

water vapor (hollow symbols) and under liquid water (filled symbols) [55,68,85,86]

nected locally flat domains [84] . However, it should be understood
that this structure describes Nafion®at maximum hydration. Other
morphologies can exist at lower water contents. The water content
is described as water molecules per sulfonic group. This water up-
take highly depends on material and environmental conditions as
it is shown in Fig. 6 .

With  decreasing  EW  the  water  uptake  of  the  membranes  in-
creases. Especially for low EW, the immersion of the membrane in
liquid water leads to a significantly higher water uptake than un-
der water vapor, which will be further discussed in section 2.1.2 .
Nevertheless,  differences  in  water  uptake  for  the  same  material,
even under presumably the same experimental conditions, are vis-
ible in Fig. 6 . These differences can be explained on the one hand
by deviations in experiment and measurement setup, and on the
other  hand  by  the  different  water  uptake  behavior  in  the  free-
water regime, depending on thermal history, production and pre-
treatments as observed by Burnett et al. [87] . Therefore a short in-
troduction into the different water regions is given. The water con-
tent can be differentiated into residual ( λ0 ), bound ( λB ) and free
( λF ) water
λ(a w ) = (λ0 ) + λB (a w ) + λF (a w )

(3)

at a given water activity ( a w ). The residual water forms the pri-
mary solvation shell and is often neglected in literature, as it pos-
sesses a strong bond and changes only at higher temperatures, e.g.
during thermo gravimetric analysis [88] . In Equation 3 it is there-
fore set to λ0  = 0. With increasing water content up to 6 water
molecules  bound  water  regimes  form  around  the  primary  shell.
λ = 2 marks the percolation threshold, when the morphology of
interconnected domains first forms. With increasing adsorption, a
further growth of the water domains and higher connectivity be-
tween the domains appears and describes the transition between
bound  water  and  free  water  regime  [70] .  Preboiled  and  casted
membranes  show  a  slightly  higher  water  uptake  than  extruded,
annealed or untreated membranes. At this point the crystallinity
is a linking parameter when regarding material characteristics in-
fluencing the water uptake. With increasing degree of crystalliza-
tion, the domain spacing in the ionomer is reduced, so is water
uptake and swelling and the mobility of the side chains and back-
bones  is  hindered,  which  can  affect  transition  rates  of  morpho-
logical changes [54,89–91] . Fig. 7 shows the relation between EW
and relative degree of crystallinity. For the same EW, SSC ionomers
have a higher ordered polymer bundle structure, which could be
linked to a slower water uptake. Mangiagli et al. [93] investigated
the water uptake for different flexible ion-containing polymer net-
works and observed a slower water uptake for stiff-backbone poly-

mers, which is higher for LSC ionomers [54] . The side chain length
and flexibility of the backbone is therefore the more decisive pa-
rameter  than  crystallinity,  but  comparing  the  same  membranes
with different pretreatments or production processes, a lower crys-
tallinity rate can be beneficial for reducing break-in time, due to a
better swelling behavior. How crystallinity changes with thermal
treatment will be provided in section 2.1.4 .

Transferring this knowledge to break-in strategies, the operation
at high gas humidities and at load conditions where a maximum
water production is reached, leads to an improved water uptake
and membrane morphology changes. Qi [11,12] performed break-
in studies by voltage cycling at a cell temperature of 75 ◦ C and
gas inlet temperatures of 90 - 95 ◦ C and compared it to the activa-
tion at 35 ◦ C cell temperature for different materials. The increased
temperature led to a reduced break-in time, due to an increased
water uptake at higher temperatures [94] , higher proton conduc-
tivity [22] and improved reaction kinetics and therefore the higher
water production in the fuel cell. The operation at higher tempera-
tures is a standard for operating low temperature PEMFC and so for
break-in. On the other side, several studies observed a reduced wa-
ter content of the membrane at elevated temperatures under vapor
[95–97] and since the operation at higher temperatures brings a
higher complexity and heating times to the break-in process, al-
ternatives should be investigated. Therefore, another approach that
targets a high water production to activate the MEA is the three-
step-activation method [32] . During step one and three the cell is
operated at a gas humidity of 64% RH. For step two, the dew point
temperature of the gases is increased above the cell temperature
and therefore liquid water can appear in the cell. During the oper-
ation at the described parameters, the cooling-after-stop technique
is applied to the cell. This means the cell is cooled down to room
temperature without any purging to increase the amount of liquid
water in the cell. The activated cell showed a 14.5% higher maxi-
mum current density. The targeted generation of condensation and
liquid water must be carried out with caution, as this can also lead
to  the  blocking  of  pores  and  severe  mass  transport  problems.  A
balance must therefore be found between condensation and expul-
sion of the liquid water. A comparable method is applied by Bez-
malinovic et al. [31] , by a sudden rapid cool-down of a running cell
below the dew-point temperature and additional potential cycling.
This approach should force the MEA to soak water and hydrate the
membrane and ionomer in the CL. The activation was completed

[100] on a cross-section of a freshly cut membrane give some in-
formation about the time dependency of this rearrangement of the
skin. The first 2-10 Minutes could not be measured due to han-
dling of the samples, during this time it is expected that the ionic
groups turn inwards within seconds [101] . After that a decrease of
high adhesion areas is observed, resulting from a loss of humidity
at the surfaces due to evaporation. After 20 minutes this area starts
to increase, which is interpreted as a further increase of PTFE rich
areas and the reduction of ionic groups on the surface [100] .

Pretreatment  processes  to  erase  the  thermal  history  of  the
membrane surface are treatments like plasma sputter etching with
argon and reactive ion etching to increase the sulfur-to-carbon ra-
tio onto the surface by removing the hydrophobic skin layer [21] .
The  former  treatment  increased  the  ionic  activity  in  only  5min
etching, which shows a performance benefit of 12.3% taking the
power  density  (W/cm 2 )  into  account.  Reactive  ion  etching  and
washing the surface with hydrogen peroxide produced the oppo-
site  effect,  the  ionic  activity  of  the  surface  was  reduced,  which
was  measured  by  the  decreased  sulfur-to-carbon  (S:C)  ratio.  It
should be considered that plasma sputter etching does not only in-
crease the S:C ratio, but also the roughness of the membrane. This
could lead to an increased contact area between membrane and
CL [67,102] and a better proton conductivity, which is important
for  the  fuel  cell  performance  [103,104] .  Manufacturing  processes
that use decal foils to produce the CL have an additional step of
hot pressing the CL onto the membrane [105] . The aforementioned
improvements on removing the hydrophobic skin of the membrane
have  to  be  reconsidered,  when  high  temperatures  and  pressures
are used to produce the catalyst coated membrane. How temper-
atures may accelerate the rearrangement of the skin is unknown.
A pretreatment could be void, when the reorganization of the hy-
drophobic skin is faster than the connection between the ionomer
of membrane and CL builds up. Hence, pretreatment methods, fo-
cusing on the membrane surface improvement, must be designed
against the background of the rapid regression of the skin structure
and therefore, should be combined with the direct coating of the
catalyst layers onto the membrane within 20 minutes for obtaining
a persistent advantage. Further investigations have to be conducted
on that topic.

after one hour and showed a comparable or even better perfor-
mance to cells that where activated by only potential cycling or op-
erated at a constant potential, which needed 2 - 4h to reach a sta-
ble performance as shown in Fig. 8 . Another approach is to steam
or boil the membrane or catalyst coated membrane as a break-in
or pretreatment strategy, which was conducted by several groups
on PEMFCs and Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) [20–22] . Be-
side the higher temperatures and high humidities to increase the
water  uptake,  these  methods  ensure  that  the  membrane  surface
is in contact with liquid water; either by condensing water in the
cell or by putting it directly into water. Performance improvements
directly after the water treatment were mostly not described, but
rather after several additional break-in steps. As shown earlier in
Fig. 5 the impact of steaming as a pretreatment method is rather
low.  A  clear  conclusion  by  Qi  [20]  was  that  a  performance  im-
provement of up to 57% could be achieved and the activation was
accelerated, when the CCM was in direct contact with liquid water
compared to steam. That brings us to the important influence of
the membrane surface, which is therefore separately discussed in
the next section.

2.1.2. Environmental contact

2.1.3. Current flow

Bass et al. [98] obtained surface measurements of contact an-
gle,  SAXS  and  atomic  force  microscopy  to  confirm  a  membrane
skin  layer  formation  of  hydrophobic  bundles  under  water  vapor,
increasing the surface tension and its kinetic barriers. These hy-
drophobic parts of the ionomer cover the hydrophilic conductive
sites and reduce the swelling kinetics of the membrane. By chang-
ing  the  medium  surrounding  the  ionomer  from  vapor  to  liquid
water, the surface skin transforms, aligning the polymer bundles
perpendicular towards the surface, supporting earlier simulations
made by Schmidt-Rohr [82] . Ionic conductive sites form a more hy-
drophilic skin layer, which enhances proton transport and reduces
the surface tension. The observation of the alignment of the po-
lar parts in the surface skin is supported by Small Angle Neutron
Scattering (SANS) conducted by Gebel [77] , picturing water con-
centration profiles across the membrane and determining the sorp-
tion kinetics of Nafion®in contact with either liquid water or va-
por. The measurement suggests that the membrane is completely
swollen  after  less  than  one  minute,  when  liquid  water  is  intro-
duced into the measurement cell. The diffusion inside the bulk is
in agreement with a Fickian behavior and shows a characteristic
time in an order of a few seconds. On the other hand, under water
vapor after more than 38 h this swelling equilibrium can not be
confirmed by SANS measurements and therefore, shows that the
membrane-gas interface is the sorption limiting factor [99] . Atomic
Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements conducted by Hiesgen et al.

When investigating the surface of a material, AFM is a useful
tool to measure roughness and adhesion factors. Concerning poly-
mer membrane surfaces, AFM measurements obtain their highest
advantage, when combined with a current sensor, which is called
conductive AFM. With the sensor, conductive areas can be differen-
tiated from non-conductive areas and therefore the actual proton
conducting network is mapped. Early studies observed that an ac-
tivation is needed to enable conductive AFM measurements [106] .
The activation is performed by forcing a faradaic current flow in
an electrolysis set-up through the material, leading to a significant
increase of the conductivity. It was expected that the current flow
induces a continuous network into the membrane morphology, but
Hiesgen et al. [107] measured a step-wise development of current
response during conductive AFM shown in Fig. 9 .

The increase appears in about 15s and indicates a visco-elastic
widening of the water channels. Later studies proved that the ex-
istence of a continuous ionic conductive network is not enough to
provide a sufficient conductivity for conductive AFM measurements
[100] , since the hydrophobic skin inhibits the connection between
the surface and the environment [83] . The current flow activation
therefore,  mainly  enables  the  conductivity  of  the  skin  layer  and
its connection to the environment. Sufficient water content can in-
deed form the interconnected network in the bulk material, but a
current flow or a water film is needed to ensure the connection
between the skin layer and the environment. In this case the nor-

ment methods [70] to compare thermal histories and their influ-
ence on the morphology and mechanical properties, that confirm
the aforementioned dependencies. The crystalline peaks at around
1.2  ̊A -1 are hardly differentiable, so the degree of crystallinity is pre-
sented in Fig. 10 (b) and clearly shows the higher crystallinity for
annealed and reduced crystallinity for preboiled membranes. The
ionomer peak at around 0.2  ̊A -1 describes the electrostatic network
and higher values indicate a smaller spacing between the ionic do-
mains. This peak clearly indicates the differences between the pre-
boiled  and  annealed  membrane.  Additionally  it  should  be  noted
that the sample ’Predried (80 ◦ C)’ was boiled and then dried in
an  oven  at  80 ◦ C,  while  the  ’Preboiled’  was  dried  under  ambi-
ent  conditions  in  a  desiccator.  This  indicates  that  the  water  up-
take capacity is improved for boiled membranes, but this increase
is  lost  as  soon  as  the  membrane  is  dried  at  elevated  tempera-
tures,  which  can  be  confirmed  by  additional  water  uptake  mea-
surements [70] . Not only crystallinity, but also the spacing between
the ionic domains is influenced by temperature treatment, which
should be considered when performing pretreatment methods like
boiling and steaming the membrane, listed as activation methods

Uniaxial stress increases the crystallisation [113] since it sup-
ports the orientation of the bundles of polymeric aggregates [114] .
Simultaneously,  the  ionic  domain  spacing  decreases  [69] .  While
the membrane stretching improves the mechanical properties, the
diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the stretching direction de-
creases  [113] .  On  the  other  side,  annealing  a  membrane  while
putting a biaxial stress onto the material produces opposite effects
and removes the orientation of the polymer backbones [73] . Since
casting imprints a reduced directional stress onto the material than
melt-extrusion, the production process influences the water uptake
and should be considered, when designing break-in strategies.

This short summary of knowledge about membrane morphol-
ogy and stressors that lead to structural changes shows that de-
pending on the initial water content after production, the proton
conducting network in the bulk material already exists. Water up-
take kinetics in the region of free water are strongly affected by
EW, crystallinity and therefore the production process. Beside this
interconnected network, the conductivity of the membrane is lim-
ited by the surface skin formation, which is influenced by its con-
tact to the environment and stressors like current flow and internal
pressure. Thermal history and mechanical stress influence the crys-
tallinity, the domain spacing and the water uptake of the mem-
brane.  Beside  material  characteristics  like  EW,  side  chain  length
and additives, temperatures during production and the production
process have to be considered, when adjusting break-in methods to
membranes. High humidities and high gas temperatures improve
the water uptake, but a forced current and liquid water accelerate
the skin rearrangement and improve the conductivity.

2.2. Ionomer contamination

Contamination of the membrane is usually discussed in terms
of cationic contamination, solvents and membrane additives. Con-
tamination due to metallic cations like Fe 3+ , Na + , Ni 2+ are mainly
considered  in  degradation  studies  [115] .  Furthermore,  these  can
decrease the proton conductivity by blocking the ion conductive
sides,  react  with  protons  and  eventually  decrease  the  cell  per-
formance or change the elctroosmotic drag [116–119] . High water
content in the membrane is used to protect it from contaminations
and helps to remove ammonium contamination [120] .

Information  about  the  migration  of  contaminations  from  the
membrane can be drawn from the scavenger migration first ob-
served  by  Stewart  et  al.  [121] .  The  cerium  migration  from  the

sion from [107]

mal operation of a fuel cell or the use of electrolysis as for conduc-
tive AFM measurements are suitable activation methods. However,
the  time  constant  of  the  step-wise  current  induced  water  chan-
nel generation implies that a repeated conditioning rather than a
break-in process occurs [107] .

2.1.4. Thermal transition

Another stressor for structure changes in the membrane is the
temperature.  On  one  side,  the  water  uptake  improves  at  higher
temperatures and on the other side, a thermal history can be im-
printed onto the material. During the casting process of the mem-
brane, the ionomer sees higher temperatures and, intentionally or
not, that influences the morphology and applies a thermal history
onto the membrane. Further production steps like boiling or an-
nealing can be used to erase that memory or to form the mor-
phology  of  the  membranes  as  desired.  To  understand  the  possi-
bilities of morphology arrangement, relevant temperature regions
should  be  visited.  PFSA  membranes  are  thermoplastic  polymers
that  show  thermally  reversible  transitions  highly  depending  on
EW, side chains, counter ion and additive [108] . Nafion®for exam-
ple has two transition regions between 55 ◦ C - 130 ◦ C and above
240 ◦ C [109] . The first range is described as the alpha transition
with  the  highest  transition  peak  at  about  100 ◦ C  (glass  transi-
tion) [69] , where the mobility of the polymer chains is thermally
enabled,  while  the  stabilization  of  the  network  is  still  present.
Above 240 ◦ C a destabilization of the polymer network takes place.
Depending  on  its  thermal  history  finally  leading  to  the  melting
of Nafion®[110] . This thermal history is important to understand
membrane morphology changes, since these polymers have the ca-
pability of memorizing temperatures as shown by Miaudet et al.
[111] and Xie [109] when performing thermal mechanical analysis
by stretching polymer fibers at different deformation temperatures.
Reheating these fibers at a fixed strain show maximal stress recov-
ery for each fiber close to its deformation temperature, while the
thermal history is expected to influence the region of mobility of
the polymer chains.

Several studies showed that the crystallinity can be increased
by annealing the membrane just above its glass transition temper-
ature [58,112] , which is e.g. carried out at 140 ◦ C for Nafion®[4] .
With increased crystallinity the mechanical stability of the mem-
brane can be improved by increasing the interlinked characteristic
of the polymer, but swelling and water uptake will be hindered.
Casting at higher temperatures shows the same effect.

On the other side, the combination of thermal treatment and
water uptake, e.g. boiling a membrane, leads to the increase of do-
main spacing and the reduction of its crystallinity.

sites [123,124] . Elemental analysis of the MEA proved the migra-
tion of the additives and the effect on protonic conductivity was
confirmed  by  impedance  measurements  [125] .  We  can  conclude
that  ion  forming  additives  can  reduce  the  protonic  conductivity,
but the advantages against degradation predominate and the con-
tamination of the active sites seems negligible, in contrast to or-
ganic additives, which in this case, lead to a severe performance
reduction. Ex-situ methods to reduce contamination, like sulfuric
acid washing to remove inorganic impurities and reprotonate the
membrane  and  boiling  in  diluted  hydrogen  peroxide  to  remove
organic impurities, can be considered [21] , but in-situ mitigation
against contamination is mainly a high water production and high
gas RH. Break-in methods aimed at the reduction of contamina-
tions thus correspond to the methods for increasing the membrane
water content.

3. Catalyst layer activation

The catalyst layer is the layer where the Oxygen Reduction Re-
action (ORR) and Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction (HOR) take place
on the cathode and anode, respectively. For the reactions to take
place within the layer with minimal losses, the CL must provide
pathways for (i) electron transport, (ii) proton transport, (iii) gas
transport and (iv) liquid water transport. The structure of the CL is
hence, porous in order of the layer to meet all these requirements.
Conventional, or state-of-the-art, catalyst layers consist of agglom-
erates of platinum particles or platinum alloys dispersed onto the
surface of carbon powder that acts as their support and provides
the pathway for electron conduction. These agglomerates are then
covered by an ionomer thin film that provides the proton trans-
port to the catalyst site. The pore space between agglomerates pro-
vides transport pathways for gaseous reactants and liquid water.
Over the years, optimization of the CL structure has been shown
to  be  one  of  the  major  breakthroughs  in  PEM  fuel  cell  perfor-
mance and durability increase [126] . Through this optimization, it
was shown that a triple-phase boundary, where the catalyst, pores
and ionomer meet, is important for the reaction to occur with min-
imal losses. Typical manufacturing methods for catalyst layers are
slot die and gravure coating, where inks consisting of catalyst pow-
der, ionomer and solvents are printed onto a substrate material,
that can either be a decal foil, a gas diffusion layer or the polymer
electrolyte membrane [127] , before it is dried. The first case would
need an additional step to transfer the catalyst layer from the decal
foil onto the membrane. Influences of process parameters and ma-

membrane  into  both  catalyst  layers  during  hotpressing  and  fuel
cell operation was measured and is investigated since. Due to this
migration during the initial operation, a comparable contamination
of  the  ionomer  in  the  CL  is  expected  and  therefore  this  section
includes membrane ionomer and thin film catalyst layer ionomer
contamination. Zhao et al. [122] investigated the influence of mem-
brane  additives  on  the  conditioning  behavior,  testing  MnO 2  and
two organic additives. The activation of the cells was performed
at 68 ◦ C and 100% RH at a low current density of 0.2A/cm 2  for
16 hours and observed that organic additives show an increasing
voltage loss in the first 2.5hours of operation, which is partially
recovered over time; leading to the conclusion that a migration to-
wards the CL active sites takes place. This was confirmed by EIS
measurements shown in Fig. 11 . The measurements showed an in-
crease of the charge transfer resistance for the 2.5h the cell po-
tential declined. Potential cycling between 0.1 and 0.45 could be
used to restore the active sites that were blocked by oxidizing or-
ganic adsorbents. We will discuss the contamination of active sites
later on. MnO 2 additives on the other side cause a smaller but con-
stant voltage loss, which is related to a reduced protonic conduc-
tivity, due to the interaction between Mn 2+ and the sulfonic acid

terial properties on the production and performance of the catalyst
layer are particularly important [105,128–131] .

The  catalyst  layer  structure  is  determined  based  on  the  ink
composition  and  the  manufacturing  method.  Solvents,  additives
and the contact to production equipment can result in contami-
nations and manufacturing parameters like temperature and pres-
sure, which can provoke unwanted ionomer morphology changes.
This is especially crucial in the hot-pressing process, which is used
to establish a good contact between the membrane and the cata-
lyst layer ionomer. The selected temperature should be above the
glass transition temperature or close to it to provide a good con-
nection [132,133] . Too high temperatures could lead to drying out
of the membrane and the catalyst layer ionomer and to increased
crystallinity, nanoporous structure losses and chemical degradation
[134] and therefore elongated break-in times [135] as already de-
scribed in section 2.1.4 . Therefore both, the membrane and the cat-
alyst layer ionomer and their glass transition temperature, have to
be  considered,  when  choosing  an  optimal  hot-pressing  tempera-
ture. Apart form that, contaminations should be removed during
the break-in and the catalyst structure should be improved towards
the desired morphology.

The main components of the catalyst layer and its aspects in
terms  of  break-in  processes  are  presented  and  discussed  in  the
next sections.

3.1. Pore structure

The  pore  structure  of  the  CL  is  important  as  oxygen  diffu-
sion through the electrode can become a limiting factor, especially
at high currents. The diffusion through the layer is often distin-
guished  depending  on  the  pore  size,  with  the  pressure  depen-
dent (Fickian or bulk) diffusion taking place in pores above 100nm
[136]  and pressure  independent  (non-Fickian  or  Knudsen)  diffu-
sion in smaller pores or through ionomer or liquid water, where
the oxygen and other gases diffuse in a dissolved condition [137] .
Hence, it is important to consider different pore size distributions
and the effect of the initial operation on these. The pore size dis-
tribution of the CL is depending on the carbon support material,
especially its pore size and tortuosity [138,139] . A further aspect is
the manufacturing method, since pressure, solvents and tempera-
tures lead to a different compression, breaking or building of cat-
alyst agglomerates and a possible blockage of void space by sol-
vents before their evaporation or replacement by liquid water. Last
but not least, the effects of the ionomer content on the pore size
distribution  and  structures  should  be  considered,  since  a  higher
ionomer  content  supports  the  formation  of  larger  agglomerates
[138] .

Starting with the carbon support, which can be roughly clas-
sified via two main groups: high surface area carbons, for which
Ketjen Black is often used as reference material, and solid or low
surface area carbons, which Vulcan is added to. Solid carbons (sur-
face area   ̃ 200 m 2 / g [138,140] ) have a higher carbon oxidation tol-
erance thanks to low surface defects and possible attack points for
oxidation and an easier access to platinum particles deposited on
the surface are as shown in Fig. 12 . However, the coverage of cat-
alyst  by  ionomer  has  recently  been  discussed  as  a  hindrance  to
achieve lower loadings because of the lower activity observed in
model systems [141] . Higher surface areas of 500 - 20 0 0 m 2 / g can
be reached with porous carbon, where the platinum is partly de-
posited in the primary pores and the direct contact between the
ionomer and the platinum is hindered [142] . However, the pores
can be tortuous and have a diameter of about 1 - 4nm and can
evoke transport limitations, especially for oxygen. Hence, the use
of accessible porous carbon is becoming more desirable as it en-
sures both, gas transport and proton transport towards the catalyst
without the risk of contamination by the ionomer itself [142] . De-

port. Reprinted with permission from [142] . Copyright ©2018 American Chemical Soci-

pending on the porous structure, different mechanisms during the
break-in can be decisive for the performance increase. For porous
carbon,  like  Ketjenblack,  water  has  to  condense  in  the  primary
pores to achieve a sufficient proton transport to the platinum par-
ticles  [143] .  A  technical  report  from  2018  [144]  states  that  this
is reached with a relative humidity of 75% and the proton trans-
port losses will be negligible once this hydration is reached. Kabir
et al. [29] investigated how catalyst materials change the break-
in behavior comparing solid carbon to High Surface Area Carbon
(HSAC). In their work, they used limiting current measurements,
ECSA and particle deposition measurements to understand the in-
fluence  of  porous  structures  and  hence,  the  respective  support
material. Using limiting current measurements before and after 1
hour of break-in, they detected a higher reduction of non-fickian
diffusion resistance for porous carbon. This improvement of oxy-
gen diffusion is traced back to the diffusion through small pores,
since the surface covered by ionomer is higher for solid carbon and
an improvement in oxygen diffusion through the electrolyte should
therefore be more pronounced. The activation was reached by cy-
cling the cell potential between 0.6 and 0.9V at 100% RH. Further
operation at extremely high water contents (RH 150%) and low po-
tentials did not lead to significant oxygen transport resistance re-
duction. This observation can be explained as follows: due to the
small pore opening size, pores are more easily blocked by platinum
particles [142] which have to be removed, for example by wash-
ing out unattached particles. The fact that an increased water pro-
duction during 8 voltage recovery cycles does not lead to a better
oxygen diffusion, could mean that not only the water production
affects diffusion paths, but rather the particle detachment that is
likely to occur due to higher potentials reached during the poten-
tial cycling. This hypothesis is supported by the results that the
mean platinum particle diameter measured at BOL and End-of-Test
(EoT) increased more significantly for solid carbon, while the ECSA
loss was higher for HSAC if comparing the same manufacturer as
shown in Fig. 13 [29] .

This  indicates  that  platinum  detachment  or  dissolution  are
more  severe  for  porous  carbon,  while  agglomeration  and  Ost-
wald ripening are dominant processes on solid carbon, which is
schematically  shown  in  Fig.  14 .  At  this  point  it  should  be  men-
tioned that the ECSA and mean particle diameter measurements
should not be overinterpreted in terms of the break-in behavior,
since the maximum mass activity of some cells is reached before
the EoT and the initial particle diameter before the break-in of one
hour is not measured. In this first hour, decisive processes, which
lead  to  changes  in  the  particle  diameter  could  have  already  oc-
curred. Nevertheless, the observed processes for different carbon
supports are supported by long-term degradation studies, where
particle coalescence could be mitigated by porous carbon [145] . On

on the ionomer type, its EW and the solvents used. A study sup-
porting the hypothesis of changes of porosity in the catalyst layer
was conducted by Zhiani et al. [76] by pre-conditioning the cell via
steaming, which reduced mainly mass transport resistances. This
effect was attributed to the removal of particles and other impu-
rities that are not anchored and will be washed out, but no sepa-
ration in different transport resistances was made, thus improved
oxygen  diffusion,  due  to  the  removal  of  excess  ionomer  content
could play a role. The first appearance of sulfate release with si-
multaneous  recovery  of  voltage  losses  was  measured  by  Zhang
et al. [148] , when analysing the product water collected after flush-
ing the cell. Kabir et al. [29] detected, when initially operating fuel
cells, a comparable phenomenon of high sulfate emission for the
first  17  hours.  Potential  cycling  increased  the  release  of  sulfate-
containing compounds as it was measured in the product water.
Combined with the increasing mass activity, this was related to an
improved accessibility to the primary pores and the removal of sul-
fonate groups from active sites. The latter will be addressed in the
section 3.3.1 . Reduced mass transport losses and the improved ac-
cessibility of pores after break-in should, therefore, be investigated
further.

Depending on the production method, the amount of volatile
solvents used to obtain the optimal ink or paste rheology for the
respective process varies. Their influence onto the active sites and
onto the distribution of ionomer at the carbon structure will be
addressed in the sections 3.3.1 and 3.2 . If solvents do not prop-
erly evaporate and free pore spaces, the oxygen diffusion can be
negatively  affected.  Depending  on  the  boiling  point,  vapor  pres-
sure and dielectric constant of the solvent, more liquid could be
trapped in the catalyst layer, even after the drying step. Production
methods used in research, such as inkjet printing and spray coat-
ing, need an ink with a high solvent to solid ratio to prevent noz-
zle clogging, but have a higher evaporation rate, due to lower boil-
ing points and the deposition on heated substrates [129] . Further,
screen printing methods, for instance, require the use of a solvent
with a lower vapor pressure than e.g. slot die inks, since it should
not  evaporate  directly  to  assure  the  release  of  the  ink  from  the
screen. Additionally slow evaporating solvents reduce crack forma-
tion for direct application processes by inhibiting shrinkage on the
catalyst layer surface [63] . This short selection of different meth-
ods  demonstrates  that  general  statements  about  solvent  evapo-
ration during break-in are difficult to make, since it depends on
the selected solvents, drying temperatures and pretreatment steps,
like rinsing with deionized water. The activation method must be
adapted to each production process.

Fig. 14.  Main structure changes during break-in for (a) solid carbon catalyst and
(b) HSAC catalyst. grey = carbon support, yellow = platinum, light blue = ionomer,
dark blue = water

the other side, the long-term ECSA loss for HSAC is lower, when
investigating platinum degradation mechanisms, which contradicts
the observations made during break-in. This indicates that disso-
lution of loosely attached particles could be the dominant process
during initial operation, supporting the hypothesis of particle de-
tachment from pore openings and therefore improving oxygen dif-
fusion into small pores ( Fig. 14 (b)).

Another parameter influencing the porosity of the catalyst layer
is  the  ionomer  content  and  distribution.  Ahn  et  al.  measured  a
lower and upper boundary for the ionomer content [146] , showing
that at high current densities with an ionomer content higher than
the optimum, pores will be blocked and the water transfer and gas
diffusion are impeded, resulting in high concentration overpoten-
tial [147] . Soboleva et al. [138] detected that pores smaller than
20nm will be covered by the ionomer, but the optimum amount of
ionomer changes with different catalyst structures, depending on
total surface, platinum deposition, pore size and distribution and

Mechanims that lead to the optimization of the porous struc-
ture of the CL are namely filling of small pores with water, clean-
ing small pore openings, reducing excess ionomer and removing
loose particles and solvents. Most of these mechanisms can be ad-
dressed by high water production as well as potential cycling that
can ultimately increase the mobility of platinum particles.

3.2. Catalyst ionomer layer

Over the last years, the effect of the catalyst layer structure on
the performance has been established with interest in regards to
the role of ionomer growing. The further decrease of the platinum
loading additionally reinforces this trend, as the utilization must
be improved. In addition to its main task to ensure proton con-
duction between the membrane and the active sites in the cata-
lyst layer, it is also used as a binder of the powder ingredients of
the layer. Simulation results from Kongkanand [136] suggest that
the oxygen diffusion through the ionomer at or near the Pt sur-
face, referred to as local oxygen resistance, is the dominant loss,
compared to oxygen transport resistance in the GDL, through the
cathode-CL and proton resistance in the cathode-CL, which is why
the research into understanding and optimizing the ionomer layer
structure is important and the activation process could be a deci-
sive aspect. Recent studies about ionomer free catalyst layers have
shown good proton conductivity at relative humidities above 90%,
but flooding problems and extremely reduced proton conductivity
at lower humidities hinder its commercialization [149–151] .

Despite this promising approach, this review will concentrate
on catalyst layers with ionomer and its role during the activation
process on the basis of the current commercial availability. PFSA
ionomer used in membranes is the basis for catalyst layer ionomer,
possessing a relative high proton conductivity and a reasonable gas
permeability  for  oxygen  diffusion  towards  the  catalyst  sites,  but
thin layers show clear differences to bulk  material in water up-
take and proton conductivity [150,152–155] below a thickness of
100nm. Hence, they should be discussed separately when exam-
ining activation mechanisms. To reach the highest proton conduc-
tion and low oxygen transport resistances, the best parameters of
the ionomer in regards to deposition on the carbon-catalyst con-
tent,  its  molecular  structure  and  orientation,  acid  strength,  oxy-
gen permeability and water uptake have to be known [126] . The
optimized structure of the ionomer in terms of deposition on the
solid content of the catalyst layer was investigated by different re-
searchers [149,156] as its distribution not only affects the proton
conductivity inside the catalyst layer, but also its ECSA, degradation
and  mass  transport  losses  [149,157] .  It  is  known  that  uniformly
deposited thin films are preferred to reduce mass transport resis-
tance. Several studies identify typical ionomer film thickness in the
catalyst layer with 4 to 20nm [158] or even below 3nm [138] , but
the film thickness depends on the substrate material, ionomer con-
tent and solvents used during deposition and can vary through-
out the catalyst layer [159] . Shimizu et al. [160] and Sharma et al.
[161] investigated how solvents influence this ionomer distribution
and the orientation of backbones and side chains. Depending on
the solvent used for the production, the ionomer covers more of
the carbon support or the platinum particle and the side chains
are oriented towards the carbon, the platinum particle or build a
self-contained accumulation of ionomer. The different thickness re-
gions lead to different swelling behavior and phase separation and
therefore  have  different  activation  problems.  EW  and  side  chain
length are additional parameters that influence oxygen transport
and proton conductivity and are also discussed. Fig. 15 (a) shows
the dependency of the ionomer nanostructure on the side chain
length, EW of the ionomer and different thicknesses. The shorter
side  chain  ionomer  shows  a  higher  ordering  and  phase  separa-
tion in thin films, while Nafion®has a higher crystallinity due to

its higher EW, but is less ordered towards a preferred direction.
Following the theory, short side chain ionomers should show less
local oxygen  resistance because of  their higher phase separation
and reduced flexibility, which weakens the interaction between the
ether group and the catalyst surface [163] . However, lower EW in-
creases  the  acid  group  density  and  more  side  chains  adsorb  on
the Pt surface, which does not only block active sites, but immo-
bilizes  the  ionomer  and  increases  oxygen  transport  losses  [164–
166] . This contact can be reduced by a higher phase separation,
which is achieved by a high water uptake [136,167] . One has to
consider  that  these  findings  were  measured  for  PFSA  thin  films
on silicon substrates. Fig. 15 (b) shows the water uptake of three
different PFSA ionomers on silicon substrate and inside the cata-
lyst layer [162] . For low EW PFSA ionomer and film thicknesses of
50nm water uptake and swelling behaviour on substrates and in
the catalyst layer are comparable. Even though Nafion® showed a
slightly lower water uptake inside the catalyst layer than on a sili-
con substrate at same hydrations, the thin film on substrate is still
a potential approximation. Below a film thickness of 20nm the sur-
face/substrate interaction dominates the ionomer structure and its
properties like the swelling behavior [162] . This thickness region
is highly interesting since it corresponds to typically targeted cat-
alyst ionomer film thicknesses [158] . Carbon as a substrate leads
to  a  more  isotropic  structure  due  to  the  weaker  interaction  be-
tween  the  SO −
3  and  the  substrate  compared  to  platinum  with  a
stronger interaction. In the latter case the domains align parallel
to the substrate, which can be accompanied by a higher densifi-
cation  and  therefore  higher  transport  resistances.  Oxidizing  con-
ditions  and  hence  the  formation  of  an  oxide  layer  on  the  plat-
inum surface weakens the interaction. These different conditions
do not only affect the ionomer structure but also the mobility of
water molecules and therefore the water uptake. A strong interac-
tion leads to the displacement of water molecules and vice versa,
at low hydrations the sorption of end groups onto the platinum
surface is enhanced. A water film that is formed on the substrate
interface seems to be advantageous but simulation results describe
the liquid water film, as the main impact on oxygen transport re-
sistances [168] . The thickness of this water film and further im-
pacts on the ionomer chain density like the interaction between
the side chain and the substrate are important to make clear state-
ments on smart break-in strategies. Several researchers addressed
this side chain orientation in the last years [169,170] and concluded
several aspects that affect this orientation. Depending on the cata-
lyst material and the carbon used, the surfaces can be less or more
hydrophilic.  The  side  chains  will  orient  towards  hydrophilic  sur-
faces and improve the proton conductivity inside the catalyst layer.
A highly simplified scheme is presented in Fig. 16 , which shows a
high Pt/C ratio surface on the left, which has a more hydrophilic
behavior and more water at the platinum sites is produced. Side
chains orient towards the catalyst surface due to their hydrophilic
character. The forming water film between the ionomer and the
catalyst improves proton conductivity and the ORR activity [171] .
This reorientation occurs as soon as water is produced and may be
a process that appears during break-in. The duration of this pro-
cess could be influenced by the initial thin film structure of the
ionomer [172] . Tesfaye et al. [173] deposited a thin film ionomer
onto platinum material to investigate the effects under oxidizing
and reducing environments, namely under oxygen and under hy-
drogen. The investigation showed that Pt-H interface leads to a re-
duced swelling and water uptake of the ionomer compared to ox-
idizing or inert interfaces, due to a denser binding of side chain
groups towards a segregated water layer at the Pt-H surface, while
under oxygen rich conditions a polar interface exists, that supports
the interaction between hydronium ions and the proton conduc-
tive end groups of the ionomer. Combining this with the findings
from Malek et al. [171] , this could lead to the conclusion that a wa-

tioned reactants in reverse order. The reduction of break-in time
declared in this patent are not comparable since the basic case is
described with 70hours of break-in duration, while the new ap-
proach  reduces  this  to  5hours.  The  concept  is  still,  however,  in-
teresting since no load cycle needs to be performed, which could
reduce the complexity of the test bench.

It can thus be summarized that side chains must orient them-
selves towards the platinum surface without contaminating it and
impeding  oxygen  diffusion.  A  high  water  content  improves  pro-
tonic conductivity. However, opposing views in regards to the ef-
fect  of  liquid  water  on  local  diffusion  still  exist  and  need  to  be
further examined. Due to the expected structural changes in the
ionomer, an impact on fuel cell degradation is possible. However,
there  is  a  lack  of  studies  on  this  relationship,  which  should  be
filled, since it is not only necessary to achieve a high beginning
of life performance, but rather also a high stability over the cell’s
life.

3.3. Catalyst activation

Looking at basic catalyst studies, the electrochemical activation
of platinum is an important topic that has already been reviewed
by James in 1967 [5] . A standard method to carry out the cata-
lyst activation is electrical oxidation-reduction cycling, also called
anodic-cathodic  polarization.  When  the  measurements  are  per-
formed with a rotating disc electrode of smooth platinum placed
in aqueous solution, two main activation mechanisms are present:
(i) the desorption of organic adsorbates or cations from the catalyst
within minutes by the formation of an oxide film [176,177] and (ii)
the rather slow mechanism of surface structuring [6] . When trans-
ferring this knowledge to fuel cell electrodes, it has to be consid-
ered, however, that catalyst in fuel cell electrodes are different in
two important aspects: (i) since small nanoparticles are used in-
stead of smooth surfaces, restructuring does not directly lead to
increased surface areas and (ii) the measurements presented were
concluded in aqueous solution which, enhance the appearance and
the  mobility  of  impurities,  while  this  effect  was  reduced  when
cleaning  the  electrolyte  with  purified  charcoal  during  the  mea-

ter film directly on the catalyst site supports proton conductivity,
but further hinders water uptake in the second layers. Good pro-
ton conductivity is not only needed at the catalyst sites, but rather
over the whole catalyst structure [100] . Shrivastava et al. [172] ob-
served for PFSA thin films of 15nm and EW of 725 and 10 0 0, one
and two monolayers of interfacial water, respectively. With increas-
ing  side  chain  length,  up  to  5  monolayers  were  detected.  Apart
from the interfacial water layer, side chain length and EW affect
the water uptake in thin ionomer layers. Lower EW and shorter
side chains lead to a higher water uptake due to more hydrophilic
channels [174] and a higher micropore volume [175] . A break-in
method  that  could  improve  the  ionomer  thin  film  formation  by
changing reducing and oxidizing environments for both electrodes
by varying reactants was patented by Schrooten et al. [28] . In two
steps the cathode potential is cycled by filling the cathode with in-
ert gas and the anode with hydrogen, without power supply. Dur-
ing step two the cathode is filled with air while the anode remains
the same. This will lead to the increase of the cathode potential.
The two steps are repeated up to 10 times. The procedure is re-
peated for the anode by filling the electrodes with the aforemen-

In  contrast  to  oxide  coverage  that  regularly  appears  during
the  fuel  cell  operation,  additives  and  solvents  coming  from  the
production or migrating from the membrane are contaminations
that  are  relevant  especially  for  the  break-in  process.  Zhao  et  al.
[122] showed that organic additives can migrate from the mem-
brane to the active sites in the catalyst layer. Further organic im-
purities originating from production as additives and solvents are
also  possible.  Organic  material  that  is  adsorbed  to  the  catalyst
surface can cause a drop in double-layer capacity [176] . Horanyi
[184] studied and reviewed the effect of a broad selection of or-
ganic impurities on platinized electrodes and seperated them into
two groups: (i) aliphatic carboxylic acids (R-COOH), that show a
fast transition between adsorbed and non adsorbed species and (ii)
aliphatic  alcohols  (R-OH),  dicarboxyl  acids  (HOOC-R-COOH),  aro-
matic compounds and acetone. This second group is characterized
by a rather low, but potential dependant, desorption rate. With the
oxygen and hydrogen adsorption and desorption, the reduction of
adsorbents is promoted.

The  recovery  protocol  from  DOE  [183]  can  be  performed  to
achieve  oxidizing  and  reducing  potentials  without  any  electrical
load, but comparable strategies that use an electrical load are pre-
sented that actively force the cell in conditions that can be harm-
ful, but are expected to activate the cell. One of such protocols is
the use of an air soak, where the fuel supply is stopped and air
is soaked from the cathode to the anode side that ultimately leads
to fuel starvation on the anode side. This was used in combina-
tion with an electrical load by Yang et al. in [185] . Oxidation reac-
tions occur at the anode to compensate missing electrons for cur-
rent production and the anode potential rises. Reactions that take
place can be platinum oxidation and dissolution, carbon corrosion
and water electrolysis. At less harmful situations, this can lead to
the oxidation of impurities. Cycling back to lower potentials, the
reduction of oxides is performed and a cleaning effect on the ac-
tive sites is possible.

Hydrogen soak is an activation method, also called air break-
ing or cathode starvation, to remove species from the active sites.
In this case, the gas flow to the cathode is stopped while hydro-
gen is still introduced to the anode and a current is drawn from
the cell. The absence of oxygen at the cathode side leads to reduc-
ing conditions and oxidized species will be removed. Air supply to
the cathode is restarted as soon as the cell voltage drops below
a certain level [1,14] . A similar cleaning effect is expected to ap-
pear, when hydrogen pumping is performed. Here nitrogen is fed
to the cathode and hydrogen to the anode and an external source
supplies power to the cell. Hydrogen will be oxidized at the an-
ode and the protons are transported to the cathode. Hydrogen will
evolve at the cathode and the negative cell potentials support the
removal of adsorbents [13] .

How  inorganic  impurities  can  affect  the  catalyst  sites  is  dis-
cussed  hereinafter.  Stewart  et  al.  [121]  detected  the  cerium  mi-
gration into the catalyst layers and with operation of the fuel cell
cerium cations showed an affinity towards platinum, but the for-
mation  of  platinum  cerium  composites  is  unlikely.  The  effect  of
cations on ORR kinetics becomes visible at the platinum ionomer
interface. Okada et al. [186] eliminated possible explanations, such

surement  [5] .  Nevertheless,  organic  and  inorganic  impurities  ex-
ist, their high mobility is investigated in [29,121] and nanostruc-
tural changes are known [178] and therefore must be considered
in terms of break-in.

3.3.1. Platinum contamination

The  reduction  of  oxide  coverage  on  platinum  is  a  rather  fast
process. Depending on species and adsorption sites, the removal
of  the  oxides  can  take  from  a  few  seconds  up  to  20min  [178–
180] and can be conducted by potential cycling or, as performed
by Galtiskaya et al. [34] , by pulsed activation, which means stiff
load profiles between OCV and 0.1V. Changing the load time from
5 to 80s indicated an optimum at 40s ( Fig. 17 ), while holding the
cell at OCV showed no effect on performance when the relaxation
time increased from 20s to 40s. In literature, different upper and
lower potential limits are specified [5,24,178,181] , but the passing
of oxygen adsorption and reduction potentials around 1.06V in an-
odic charge and 0.8V in cathodic polarization are concurrent ap-
proaches.

Even lower reducing potentials can be achieved by cathode star-
vation  as  it  was  performed  by  Balogun  et  al.  [1] ,  where  hydro-
gen  evolution  and  therefore  reducing  conditions  at  the  cathode
were provoked, to clean the active sites from oxides and hydrox-
ides.  The  increase  of  the  double  layer  capacitance  was  observed
and explained by higher ECSA values compared to activation meth-
ods without reducing potentials at the cathode electrode. Another
method for oxide reduction is CO-stripping by cycling the cell po-
tential between 0.5V and 1V while supplying the cell with a nitro-
gen flow traced with 0.5% CO [182] . CO is oxidized to CO 2 , then re-
moved from the active sites; therefore, cleaning the platinum from
oxide coverage and impurities [36] .

Since oxide coverage is a reversible contamination, one can fol-
low the recovery protocol given by the DOE, where several nitro-
gen, air and hydrogen soaks are performed to recover reversible
losses [183] , listed in Table 3 .

as  blocking  of  active  sites  and  changes  of  oxygen  reduction  re-
action schemes, and explained the measured reduced kinetics to
changes in the double layer at the interface as concluded earlier
by Barker [176] . The double layer forms due to the charge of the
electrode and its interaction with ionic species in the ionomer. Re-
action rates are affected by the strength of this electric field and its
thickness. Cations with a high affinity towards sulfonic acid groups
that  replace  protons  can  lead  to  a  thicker  electric  double  layer
and therefore reduced reaction kinetics [186] . Cleaning strategies
concentrating on cation removal are not known from fuel cell re-
search, but oxide film formation is a common method in catalyst
synthesis, which is done by potential cycling [177] . Several studies
measured an increase of the double layer capacitance for Nafion
membranes with cyclic voltammetry or EIS measurements before
and  after  activation,  which  was  attributed  to  the  ECSA  increase
[1,22,24] . This increase should be investigated further since it is an
indicator for the available reaction zone and decisive for the fuel
cell performance.

One major aspect regarding the blocking of active sites are sul-
fonate anions from side chains that adsorb onto the catalyst. Sug-
awara et al. [187] first presented the hypothesis that during mem-
brane degradation, sulfonate groups are trapped in the MEA and
adsorb on the active sites, blocking the ORR. In 2010 Subbaraman
et al. [188] and Ohma et al. [189] detected the potential depen-
dant adsorption of sulfonate groups to the platinum surface that
suppresses the Pt-oxide formation, which inhibits the ORR activ-
ity  [190–192] .  Additionally,  the  contact  between  the  acid  group
immobilizes the side chains and increases the local oxygen resis-
tance,  which  is  assigned  as  one  of  the  main  limiting  factors  for
PEM fuel cell efficiency [136] . Beside the contamination itself, the
main problem is therefore, the effect on the ionomer. A high water
production is proposed to remove the contaminants, since a dry
ionomer increases the anion adsorption [167] . This does not only
improve the protonic conductivity, but also the oxygen permeabil-
ity.

As  mentioned  earlier  in  the  section  3.1 ,  Kabir  et  al.  [29]  de-
tected a high sulfate emission in the product water during break-in
by potential cycling. This is interpreted as a decomposition product
from sulfonate groups [148] removed from active sites, which leads
to an increased mass activity. Further research is needed to con-
firm the source of the sulfate emissions, since after EoT an ECSA
decrease up to 21% was measured, which contradicts the mecha-
nism of cleaning of active sites. On the other hand, Silva [24] ob-
served an ECSA increase during activation at constant voltages and
25 ◦ C. Three main differences should be considered to understand
this contradiction: (i) Silva [24] used a three to ten times higher
platinum loading (ii) the whole CCM in the latter study is signifi-
cantly thicker, due to two times thicker membrane and the higher
platinum loading, thus, the hydration of the CL and the membrane
would take longer and so does the increase of the reaction zone
and  (iii)  the  activation  methods  vary  in  terms  of  a  considerably
lower humidity and in using higher operation potentials. All three
aspects  support  the  conclusion  that  the  cleaning  of  active  sites
takes longer in the latter study, explaining the increase in mea-
sured ECSA.

However, for state-of-the-art CCM the detachment of contam-
inants  from  the  platinum  surfaces  should  be  a  rather  fast  pro-
cess  completed  after  a  few  potential  cycles,  but  the  desorbed
impurities  have  to  be  removed  from  near  the  platinum  surfaces
to  prevent  reattachment  and  a  high  water  production  is  neces-
sary.  Consequently,  it  can  be  concluded  that  contamination  cov-
ering  the  active  sites  should  play  a  subordinate  role  for  break-
in, due to its rather fast removal by potential cycling. Neverthe-
less, its impact on the double layer capacity, the ionomer thin film
and the blockage of pores should be the focus of future research.
This can be highlighted in material and production development

where ex-situ activation strategies can be designed and utilized.
Nevertheless,  potential  cycling  and  a  high  water  production  are
promising in-situ strategies to remove impurities from the catalyst
layer.

3.3.2. Platinum structure

Potential-induced  mechanisms  resulting  in  platinum  detach-
ment  and  agglomeration  are  known  and  explain  how  potential
cycling  leads  to  particle  growth  [193,194] .  Processes  that  deter-
mine  the  change  in  particle  size  and  structure  during  the  ini-
tial operation and their influence on performance are hence, con-
sidered in this review. Platinum particle size in fuel cells ranges
from  1nm  to  100nm  and  can  be  described  as  nano-single  crys-
tals [195] . To increase the mass activity of the catalyst, the sur-
face  to  volume  ratio  should  be  high,  which  is  achieved  by  de-
creasing  the  particle  size.  With  the  reduction  of  the  nanoparti-
cle  diameter  below  3nm,  a  strong  adsorption  of  oxygenated  in-
ads ,  OH
termediate  species  (mainly  O
ads )  is  reached
[196,197] ,  which  is  suggested  to  hinder  the  ORR  [198,199] .  This
is usually taken as an explanation as to the reason an optimum
particle  size  is  indicated  to  be  around  2  -  4nm  [200] ,  where  a
high mass activity and a low barrier for OH removal meet. Mean
particle diameter ultra-SAXS/SAXS and TEM measurements of pris-
tine material and after 17hours of potential cycling show a particle
growth of 9.5 - 37% during break-in, depending on support mate-
rial and initial particle size [29] . All measured initial mean particle
sizes are in the optimum range and therefore, the improvement
in  performance  cannot  be  attributed  to  changes  in  particle  size,
especially that in [29] this is accompanied by a reduction of the
ECSA.

ads  and  OOH

Besides  particle  growth,  the  structuring  of  the  surface  is  po-
tential  dependant  as  can  be  seen  in  cyclic  voltammogram  mea-
surements that develop defect peaks depending on the upper and
lower  potential  limits.  Since  the  ORR  can  be  structure  sensitive
and is the rate determining step in a fuel cell, due to its slower
kinetics, the main developing platinum particle surface structures
during  first  operation  are  presented  and  the  effect  on  ORR  spe-
cific and mass activity discussed. Fig. 18 shows the stable cyclic
voltammogram  of  a  smooth  and  clean  Pt(111)  surface  (black)  ir-
reversibly  changing  when  potential  cycling  exceeds  1.2V  for  10
(green) and 20 (red) cycles [201] . Up to 1.2V mainly reversible plat-
inum  oxidation  takes  place,  that  is  visible  in  the  oxide  peak  at
1.06V in the cyclic voltammogram. When reaching higher poten-
tials, place exchange occurs, where oxide covered platinum atoms
change  the  position  with  the  oxygen  and  therefore,  sub-surface
platinum  is  exposed  [193] .  With  longer  time  and  higher  poten-

leaching of the alloys prior to any operation to prevent any mem-
brane contamination, which would form a protecting platinum rich
surface layer. Potential cycling above the OCV potential increases
this Pt-enriched  layer by further  selectively  dissolving the  intro-
duced metal atoms [210] . This selective leaching, also called deal-
loying  is  a  common  activation  process  for  alloys  and  was  per-
formed  by  Koh  [211]  for  Pt/Cu  nanoparticles  and  by  Baldizzone
et al. [212] for Pt/Ni nanoparticles with 200 cycles between 0.05
and 1.2V and a scan rate of 0.1 or 0.5V/s respectively. The latter
method showed a stable ECSA after 100 cycles, which corresponds
to  about  7.5min,  while  the  first  method  needed  200  cycles  and
therefore, more than one hour to activate the platinum alloy. Nev-
ertheless, if the non-noble metal or the scan rate are decisive for
the longer activation time is unclear. Consequently, it can be con-
cluded  that  platinum  alloys  could  lead  to  longer  break-in  times,
depending on their type and on their activation state while pro-
cessed, but further investigations are needed. The ECSA reduction
after 17hours of initial cycling was reported for different platinum
on carbon support, but only platinum cobalt alloy showed a small
increase of 0.3% of ECSA [29] and the adaption of activation meth-
ods  on  whether  platinum  or  platinum  alloys  are  used  was  pro-
posed [49] . This ECSA increase is surprising as a particle growth
for the platinum alloy takes place. One possible explanation, beside
additional dealloying, could be that the removal of sulfate-anions
from the surface plays a more significant role for platinum alloys,
since cobalt attracts the anion stronger [213] and the ECSA reduc-
tion by particle growth is compensated by the removal of attached
contaminants.

3.3.4. Platinum group metal free catalysts

Even though platinum and platinum alloy catalysts have a high
ORR  activity,  disadvantages  such  as  limited  resources  and  high
costs  are  the  main  obstacle  for  mass  production.  This  is  mainly
due  to  the  catalyst  price  accounting  for  about  42%  of  the  cost
of an 80kW PEMFC stack assuming a production volume of 500
0 0 0units/year [214] ; hence, the interest in Platinum Group Metal
(PGM)-free  catalysts  [215] .State-of-the-art  PGM-free  catalysts  are
Fe-N-C, Co-N-C and Mn-N-C structures [216] . These catalysts are
based  on  carbon  structures,  which  are  doped  with  Nitrogen  (N)
molecules.  The  doping  process  brings  the  advantage  of  an  im-
proved ORR activity due to the higher electronegativity of nitrogen
compared  to  carbon.  These  N-doped  structures  can  be  co-doped
with non-precious transition metals to improve the ORR activity. A
crucial aspect, which has been strongly researched in recent years,
is the setting of suitable porosities for these catalyst materials. The
simplest synthesis by mixing carbon structures with nitrogen and
the respective metal and using pyrolysis results in large agglom-
erates and low porosities. Advanced methods include the use of
Metal-Organic  Frameworks  (MOFs),  carbon  fibers  and  nanotubes
and the use of a dual templating method. While Fe catalysts show
the highest power density [217] a major disadvantage of the us-
age is the possible amplification of the formation of radicals from
hydrogen peroxide which attack the ionomer structures and lead
to a strong decomposition of the material.A promising approach is
the application of Mn-N-C catalyst, which shows a higher stabil-
ity than Fe-N-C catalysts despite the lower power densities [218] .
Few literature, which tackles the activation of PGM-free catalysts,
exists. Slack et al. [219] highlighted the importance of this topic
by  comparing  PGM-free  catalysts  with  different  binder  composi-
tions. They found that this difference in composition can result in
significant differences in the first hours of operation as shown in
Fig. 20 .

The stability of the catalyst material was clearly improved by
the usage of PVDF but this leads to long activation times, up to
150hours. This activation period is explained by the initial low wa-
ter content and the accordingly low protonic conductivity of the

sion from [206] . Copyright ©2009 Springer Nature

tials,  more  exchanged  platinum  atoms  emerge  and  the  cathodic
transient to lower potentials enhances the platinum oxide disso-
lution [201] . This leads to the formation of vacancies and adatoms
in the metal lattice, namely a larger surface roughness with steps
[202] . The evolving hydrogen adsorption and desorption peaks in-
dicate Pt(110) and Pt(100) step sites [201] . Nanoparticles already
show rather stepped surfaces that consist of steps, edges and kinks
than terrace surfaces like Pt(111) [195] and their cyclic voltammo-
gram is therefore comparable to the red and green courses. Ruge
et al. [201] showed that edges are preferred targets for oxidation,
which supports earlier studies, that rounding of the Pt nanoparti-
cles takes place during the first 200min of operation of a fuel cell
[178,203] . Moreover, Ramaker et al. [178] showed that rounding of
the nanoparticles increases the ORR mass activity, since no signif-
icant particle size increase took place and the specific ORR activ-
ity is improved. The observation that ORR prefers Pt(111) terrace
sites is supported by earlier studies [195,198] , but is described as
a rather small structure sensitivity and contradictory findings exist
[159,204] .

Consequently, it can be concluded that platinum particle size
and  their  surface  roughness  are  performance  determining  as-
pects,  but  during  initial  operation  a  decrease  of  ECSA  super-
imposes  any  improvements.  The  structure  sensitivity  of  ORR  is
rather  small,  but  the  rounding  of  particles  leads  to  the  increase
of  Pt(111)-terraces  and  therefore,  to  an  improved  ORR  specific
activity.

3.3.3. Platinum alloys

Catalysing  the  ORR  is  the  main  challenge,  which  can  be  im-
proved  by  the  utilization  of  platinum  alloys.  An  additional  cri-
terium is the higher stability that could be achieved [205] . Plotting
the kinetic current density as a function of oxygen adsorption en-
ergy of different platinum alloys relative to pure platinum, a vol-
cano  plot  as  pictured  in  Fig.  19  forms.  In  brief,  alloys  that  bind
oxygen around 0.2eV weaker than the binding energy of platinum
show the best combination of strong enough OOH binding and an
easier  release  of  OH  and  O  [206] .  This  is  achieved  by  decreas-
ing the nearest neighbor distance, when introducing the smaller
metals into the platinum crystal structure [207] . Immersing mea-
surements from Hoshi in 0.5M H 2 SO 4  solution at 25 ◦ C showed
that the dissolution of the metal atoms from the platinum lattice
clearly exist in the first hour of immersion [208] and imposes a
voltage reduction at open circuit. Mukerjee [209] assumed a pre-

binder, which was confirmed by a decreasing high frequency re-
sistance. Barkholtz et al. [220] observed a faster break-in for a Fe-
N-C catalyst within three polarization cycles. The current density
increase was assigned to the mass transport limited region, a mis-
leading description since for PGM-free catalyst this describes the
region where the current is limited due to the low efficiency of
the active sites rather than the limited oxidant supply. This infor-
mation is important to conclude that break-in mechanism of PGM-
free catalysts are mainly due to activity increase of the active sites
3.3 and protonic conductivity of the binder, which is influenced by
the ionomer hydration and structure. Further studies of different
PGM-free catalysts observed an initial behavior of either an imme-
diate decrease of the cell performance [221,222] or a long activa-
tion time of 40h to 150h [223–225] . While the degradation process
is analysed as a problem of demetallization due to a high water
flow in the micropores [221] or carbon corrosion [222] , the acti-
vation mechanisms were not investigated further. One main aspect
that could explain the long activation times is the thickness of the
catalyst layer, which varies between 35-90μm due to the high load-
ings  of  2-6mg/cm 2 .  The  thicker  catalyst  layers  need  longer  time
to  reach  a  good  hydration.  The  right  operation  conditions  seem
to reduce this long activation time, which was proved by Osmieri
et al. [226] who measured an activation time of only 4.5h and op-
timized the break-in process by operating the MEA at low voltages
and high current densities to achieve a good hydration and acti-
vation at comparable catalyst loadings. Further aspects that could
lead to long activation times in PGM-free catalysts platinum and
platinum  alloy  catalysts  are  a  different  porosity,  lower  activities
and the different interaction of the ionomer towards the substrate
[227] . The latter is suspected due to the substrates that differ in
their hydrophobicity from platinum-carbon substrates. Due to the
wide range of different catalysts and synthesis pathways contrary
statements exist for example about the accessibility of the micro-
pores. While Chenitz et al. [221] speak of a high water flow inside
the micropores, Primbs et al. [228] measured a low accessibility
of the micropores and therefore low protonic conductivities. Fur-
ther investigations are needed, but at the moment the hydration,
activity  increase  and  probably  interactions  between  the  ionomer
and  the  substrate  are  the  main  aspects  affecting  the  break-in
process.

4. Summary and outlook

In this review, we summarized the latest status on activation
mechanisms in PEM  fuel cells. The review focused especially on
the current knowledge of the interconnection between the struc-
ture of the MEA components, membrane and CL and the morpho-
logical changes that occur within the layers during the first oper-
ation of the cell. Activation methods that evoke such changes are
summarized for each layer and possible explanations were put for-
ward. The main conclusions drawn from this review can be sum-
marized as follows:

(i) The water diffusion in the membrane bulk is fast, but if the wa-
ter channels have to form, several orders of magnitude higher
transport resistances are possible.

(ii) As soon as liquid water is in contact with the membrane sur-
face, rearrangements of the side chains are promoted and the
water uptake is accelerated.

(iii) The removal of contaminations from the membrane can be a
slow process and severe performance reduction is possible.
(iv) Solvents have a high impact on the ionomer distribution and
are a possible source for blockage of pores and reduce oxygen
permeability in the catalyst layer. This must be taken into ac-
count  when  selecting  solvents  used  in  the  production  of  the
membrane and catalyst layer.

(v) Platinum  particle  size  increases  during  activation,  which  is  a
detrimental  effect  and  crystal  structure  changes  should  have
only a small effect on ORR activity.

(vi) Platinum  alloys  can  elongate  the  activation  time  and  need  a
high number of cycles, when not dealloyed prior to the cata-
lyst production.

The  severity  and  time  constants  of  various  activation  mecha-
nisms  are  found  to  be  a  decisive  design  parameter  of  the  acti-
vation  protocols.  Table  4  summarizes  the  main  mechanisms  and
gives an estimation of the time scale where near steady state is
reached. It must be noted that this is a rough estimate from the
collected  knowledge  and  serves  only  as  an  indicator,  since  time
scales depend highly on material, operation conditions and produc-
tion methods. The parameters are based on the assumption that
the fuel cell environment is fully humidified and is exposed to el-

evated temperatures and high water production. The severity pa-
rameter is  an estimation of  the mechanism’s impact on the cell
performance, if the mechanism does not occur during the break-
in period. These values are based on a state-of-the-art commer-
cial MEA. Hence, when transferring the knowledge gathered in this
review to, for instance, an in-house produced catalyst layer with
poor pore structure or high solvent contamination, the estimations
given in Table 4 would have to be adapted.

Transferring this knowledge to stack and system level, the inter-
action of various effects has to be considered. The system relevant
components do not affect the stack factory acceptance test. How-
ever, components such as bipolar plates and system components
such as gas humidifiers and air compressor can introduce further
contamination. Methods that can be applied to cell level compo-
nents,  however,  cannot  be  directly  transferred  to  the  stack  level
due to limited gas flow or the fact that the cell potential cannot be
controlled directly. The latter is important, for instance, when aim-
ing to reduce catalyst contamination or improve thin film struc-
ture.

Despite  the  abundance  of  work  on  defining  activation  and
break-in procedures, there is still the need for ”smart” and ”fast”
activation procedures. Research on methods for this fast break-in
procedure  is  already  available,  however,  a  lack  of  knowledge  in
terms of the various mechanisms combined with advanced under-
standing  of  the  dominant  processes  influencing  the  break-in  are
still  lacking.  A  clear  differentiation  between  the  severity  of  the
mechanisms is missing, especially in regards to thin film transition
and reduction of contamination in the various layers of the MEA.
”Smart” break-in procedures can build on the knowledge that re-
duction of local oxygen resistance near the Pt surface can result in
a reduction of the activation time without reducing the stability of
the cell and beginning of life performance. Such research can be
carried out simultaneously with catalyst layer production research
where  knowledge  can  be  gathered  in  terms  of  novel  production
methods that lead to reduction of activation time; thus, reducing
overall production costs and the better understanding of the im-

few studies on a possible relation between the break-in procedure
and the fuel cell degradation exist, which is important to decide
about the degree of activation that is needed and to exclude harm-
ful activation methods.

Appendix A. State-of-the-art activation protocols

Two methods on how to activate the CCM of a PEM fuel cell
are presented in detail. The DOE protocol [2] ( Tab. A.5 ) and the
protocol  from  Balogun  et  al.  [1]  ( Tab.  A.6 ).  Cells  that  were  acti-
vated following these protocols showed high power densities and
a good durability after 90 0 0cycles of an accelerated stress test as
described in section 1.
