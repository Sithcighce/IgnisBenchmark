    "standard_answer": "The effective diffusion coefficient (D_eff) in GDLs is significantly influenced by microstructure characteristics including pore size distribution and tortuosity. According to fractal theory, D_eff can be expressed as D_eff = D_bulk * ε^(α) * (1 - ε_p/ε)^β, where ε is porosity, ε_p is percolation threshold, and α, β are fractal dimensions. Smaller pores (<50nm) dominate Knudsen diffusion where D_Kn ∝ r_pore√(T/MW), while larger pores (>700nm) follow bulk diffusion. The paper states: 'The gas-phase reactant transport through bulk diffusion becomes dominant...while the Knudsen diffusion becomes dominant...'. Tortuosity (τ) further reduces D_eff through elongated pathways, with τ often modeled as τ = 1/√ε for fibrous materials. The anisotropic nature of carbon fibers creates directional dependence, where in-plane D_eff is typically higher than through-plane by ~30% due to fiber orientation.",

    "standard_answer": "The thermal conductivity anisotropy in GDLs arises from the preferential orientation of carbon fibers during manufacturing. The effective thermal conductivity tensor k_eff can be expressed as: k_eff = [k_ip 0 0; 0 k_ip 0; 0 0 k_tp], where k_ip (in-plane) is typically 3-5 times higher than k_tp (through-plane). For a fiber orientation distribution f(θ), the conductivity components are: k_ip = ∫k_fiber*cos²θ*f(θ)dθ + k_binder*(1-φ_fiber) and k_tp = ∫k_fiber*sin²θ*f(θ)dθ + k_binder*(1-φ_fiber), where φ_fiber is fiber volume fraction.

    "standard_answer": "The capillary pressure P_c in GDLs is governed by the Young-Laplace equation: P_c = 2γcosθ/r, where γ is surface tension, θ is contact angle, and r is pore radius. Hydrophobic treatment with PTFE increases θ from ~80° to >100°, changing the cosθ term sign. For a pore size distribution f(r), the effective P_c becomes P_c,eff = ∫(2γcosθ/r)*f(r)dr. The paper states: 'For a hydrophilic porous medium...whereas for a hydrophobic porous medium...'. With PTFE loading, the threshold pressure for water intrusion increases nonlinearly - typically from ~1 kPa (untreated) to ~5 kPa (20wt% PTFE). This creates a capillary pressure curve with distinct drainage and imbibition branches due to contact angle hysteresis.",

    "standard_answer": "The heat pipe effect in GDLs involves phase-change heat transfer where water evaporates at hot spots (T~80°C) and condenses in cooler regions (T~70°C). The effective conductivity enhancement is: k_eff = k_solid + k_latent, where k_latent = (h_fg*m_dot*L)/(A*ΔT). Here h_fg is enthalpy of vaporization (~2260 kJ/kg), m_dot is vapor mass flux, L is characteristic length (~100μm), and ΔT is temperature difference. The paper states: 'This heat transfer mechanism is generally referred to as heat pipe effect'. For typical conditions (m_dot≈1e-4 kg/m²s), k_latent ≈ 2 W/mK, doubling the effective conductivity.
