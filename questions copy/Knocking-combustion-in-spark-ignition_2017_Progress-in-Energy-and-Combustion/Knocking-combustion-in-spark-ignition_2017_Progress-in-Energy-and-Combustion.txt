Knocking combustion research is crucially important because it determines engine durability, fuel consump-
tion, and power density, as well as noise and emission performance. Current spark ignition (SI) engines suf-
fer from both conventional knock and super-knock. Conventional knock limits raising the compression ratio
to improve thermal efficiency due to end-gas auto-ignition, while super-knock limits the desired boost to
improve the power density of modern gasoline engines due to detonation. Conventional combustion has
been widely studied for many years. Although the basic characteristics are clear, the correlation between the
knock index and fuel chemistry, pressure oscillations and heat transfer, and auto-ignition front propagation,
are still in early stages of understanding. Super-knock combustion in highly boosted spark ignition engines
with random pre-ignition events has been intensively studied in the past decade in both academia and
industry. These works have mainly focused on the relationship between pre-ignition and super-knock,
source analyses of pre-ignition, and the effects of oil/fuel properties on super-knock. The mechanism of
super-knock has been recently revealed in rapid compression machines (RCM) under engine-like conditions.
It was found that detonation can occur in modern internal combustion engines under high energy density
conditions. Thermodynamic conditions and shock waves influence the combustion wave and detonation ini-
tiation modes. Three combustion wave modes in the end gas have been visualized as deflagration, sequential
auto-ignition and detonation. The most frequently observed detonation initiation mode is shock wave reflec-
tion-induced detonation (SWRID). Compared to the effect of shock compression and negative temperature
coefficient (NTC) combustion on ignition delay, shock wave reflection is the main cause of near-wall auto-
ignition/detonation. Finally, suppression methods for conventional knock and super-knock in SI engines are
reviewed, including use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), the injection strategy, and the integration of a
high tumble - high EGR-Atkinson/Miller cycle. This paper provides deep insights into the processes occurring
during knocking combustion in spark ignition engines. Furthermore, knock control strategies and combus-
tion wave modes are summarized, and future research directions, such as turbulence-shock-reaction interac-
tion theory, detonation suppression and utilization, and super-knock solutions, are also discussed.

1. Introduction

PIn recent years energy and environmental issues have become of
more and more concern worldwide. In order to cut greenhouse gas
exhaust, particularly CO2 emissions, a series of emission standards
on vehicle fuel consumption have been mandated in many countries.
After 2025, even more stringent CO2 emission regulations are under
discussion. In Japan, industry and academia have started a project
named the Research Association of Automotive Internal Combustion
Engines (AICE), aiming at improving gasoline engine thermal effi-
ciency to an unprecedented level of 50% by 2020. In Europe, major
light-duty vehicle markets are moving toward about 95 g/km CO2 by
2020. In the US, the average annual rate of CO2 emission reduction
for MYs (model year) 2017 through 2021 is 3.5 percent per year and

P5 percent per year for MYs 2022 through 2025. In China, the current
fuel consumption standard for domestically produced passenger
cars is 6.9 L/100 km, which will be cut to 5.0 L/100 km in 2020, 4.0 L/
100 km in 2025, and 3.2 L/100 km in 2030. Based on projections by
the IEA (International Energy Agency), among light-duty vehicles
and passenger cars in 2020, 70% will be powered by gasoline
engines, and almost all vehicle models will use gasoline or diesel
engines. By 2050, 58% of passenger cars will still be using internal
combustion engines, among which 85% will be hybrid vehicles.
Hybrid engines benefit from the advantages of internal combustion
engines for high power density and battery electric motors for high
energy conversion efficiency. The fundamental cause of fuel saving
is due to the adoption of a high efficiency dedicated engine to con-
vert fuel chemical energy to power. Therefore, internal combustion

Pengines will likely be the mainstream of the world's transportation
fleet for a very long time. With more stringent regulations on fuel
economy, more efficient internal combustion engines are being
developed worldwide.

PCurrently, there are more than one billion vehicles in the world
and more than 60% of them are equipped with gasoline spark igni-
tion (SI) engines. Compared with diesel engines, gasoline engines
using the non-expensive three-way catalytic converter (TWC) can
meet the stringent emission regulations and have greater potential
for further improvement in engine efficiency. However, the biggest
obstacle for an SI engine to improve thermal efficiency is its knock
tendency, which keeps engines from achieving optimized combus-
tion phasing and higher compression ratio. Therefore, to meet future
fuel economy and emission regulations, knock in high-efficiency
engines must be well understood.

PKnock is the name given to the noise associated with the auto-
ignition of a portion of the fuel-air mixture ahead of the propagating
flame front [1]. It is an inherent problem that plagues internal com-
bustion engines, and it has been studied intensively for decades. In
the literature, four terms are used to describe the phenomenon:
knock, engine knock, knocking and knocking combustion. In order
to uniformly describe it, “knocking combustion” is adopted in this
review paper.

PWhen knocking combustion occurs, high-frequency pressure oscil-
lations can be observed. The SI engine can be damaged by knocking
combustion in different ways: piston crown melting, piston ring stick-
ing, cylinder bore scuffing, piston ring-land cracking, cylinder head
gasket leakage and cylinder head erosion. To enhance power density
and reduce fuel consumption, high boost with direct injection has
become the mainstream technology in SI engines in recent years and
a new knocking mode, called super-knock [2(cid:1)4] has become a chal-
lenge for engine designers, especially with respect to direct injection
engines in the low-speed, high-load operating regime. Fig. 1 shows
typical damage resulting from conventional knock and super-knock.

PIn recent decades knocking combustion has been studied inten-
sively not only with focus on conventional knock, but also on super-
knock due to the desirable high boost technology in high efficiency gas-
oline engines, and the number of published papers relating to engine
knock have increased greatly in the past 10 years (Tables 1 and 2).

PIn general, knocking combustion research is crucially important
because it determines engine durability, fuel consumption, and

and future trends in knocking combustion for high-efficiency
engines based on engine testing, numerical simulation and optical
diagnostics, with highlights of recent important progress in highly
boosted SI engines. First, the basic characteristics of knocking com-
bustion are summarized to achieve a deeper understanding of end-
gas auto-ignition modes, which are related to conventional knock
and super-knock. Then, influencing factors of auto-ignition and pres-
sure oscillations are presented based on numerical simulation and
optical diagnostics, including discussion of the source of pre-igni-
tion, and the effect of oil/fuel properties, thermodynamic conditions
and shock waves. Finally, suppression methods and future directions
for conventional knock and super-knock are reviewed.

2. Conventional knock in SI engines

2.1. Basic characteristics of engine knocking combustion

PEngine knock arises from auto-ignition of the end gas ahead of
the propagating flame. Fig. 2 presents the pressure trace, pressure
oscillation, heat release rate (HRR) and unburned gas temperature
(T) of a typical knocking case. The combustion process of the knock-
ing case has two stages: flame propagation induced by spark ignition
and end-gas auto-ignition causing pressure oscillation.

PThe flame propagation stage is from spark ignition to the crank
angle of CAko (the onset of pressure oscillation), reaching the value
of Pko. The heat release rate shows an increasing tendency generally

Poctane number suggests more resistance to auto-ignition. The RON
and MON tests have standard procedures on a single-cylinder engine
[160]. During the measurements, different mixtures of Primary Ref-
erence Fuel (PRF), including n-heptane and isooctane are tested until
the knock behavior of the test fuel is matched. The operating condi-
tions for the RON and MON test, as shown in Table 3, are different;
MON is tested at a severer situation, where the intake temperature
is higher and the engine speed is higher. RON is higher than MON for
most non-PRF fuels and the sensitivity (S) of the fuel is defined as
S = RON (cid:1) MON. Since engine operating conditions vary greatly, RON
and MON are designed as limiting operating conditions, but are not
enough to describe the knock resistance of all fuels. To cover the
whole operating range, Kalghatgi et al. [161,162] proposed the
Octane Index (OI), defined as,

OI 1⁄4 K ¢ MON þ ð1 (cid:1) KÞ ¢ RON:

ð4Þ

PK depends on the engine operating conditions and is supposed to
be independent of fuel properties, and K tends to become negative
for the most knock-limited regions in modern SI engines [161(cid:1)168].
The development of engine design, such as use of an advanced cool-
ing system, boost system, and injection system, have contributed to
the decrease of K [167]. This means that the operating condition for
modern engines tends to exceed the boundary defined by the oper-
ating conditions for both the RON and MON tests. Boot et al. plotted
the correlation for K with unburnt gas temperature (e.g., at a com-
pression pressure of 15 bar, Tcomp15 [164,169(cid:1)171]) as shown in
Fig. 3 [172]. Note that for RON and MON test conditions, Tcomp15 is
roughly 700 and 850 K respectively. Values for K tend to be negative
when Tcomp15 is lower than the corresponding temperature for the
RON test. In modern SI engines, Tcomp15 tends to be lower is due to
the lower intake temperature than that in the RON and MON tests,
in which the engines are the same as the prototype in the 1930s, and

Pduring this stage, with possibly a short term drop caused by the
downward movement of the piston and heat transfer. The unburned
gas temperature rises stably, caused by the compression heating
effect of the burned gas and propagating flame, plus the compression
or expansion due to the moving piston. The knock sensor signal
shows no oscillations, since only flame propagation exists and there
is no pressure oscillation in this stage. In the auto-ignition stage, the
pressure trace at first increases dramatically, reaching a peak value,
and then it oscillates with decaying amplitude. The knock sensor sig-
nal also oscillates from CAko. As for the combustion process, at CAko,
the pressure and temperature of the end gas reaches a high level,
causing the auto-ignition combustion phenomenon in the combus-
tion chamber. Once auto-ignition is induced, a pressure wave can
propagate into the chamber, reflecting back and forth from the walls,
causing pressure oscillations.

PHeat Release Rate (HRR), Temperature of the unburned gas
(T_unburned), maximum pressure rise (Dp) and Knock Intensity (KI)
are four important parameters that characterized knock behavior.
HRR is calculated according to the first law of thermodynamics. In
the calculation of T_unburned, the end-gas compression process is
considered to be adiabatic. KI is integrated using the pressure oscil-
lation obtained by high-pass filtering (HPF), as follows:

2.2. Knock resistance and fuel chemistry

been adopted for gasoline fuels since the 1920s [159]. A higher

Pare fueled by heated carburetors [163] and fitted with inadequate
cooling systems [167].

PAlthough the above fuel ignition indices, RON, MON, and OI, have
been used to describe fuel anti-knock properties in automotive engi-
neering, the relationship between RON/MON and OI/K is still not
clear. This is because auto-ignition in internal combustion engines is
directly associated with the combustion chemistry of hydrocarbons
at different operating conditions (T, P, F, etc.).

PBecause of the competition of reaction pathways and the
variation of predominant reaction classes at different conditions
[176], the reactivity of a fuel molecule presents a complex
behavior. Since b-scission [101] is slow at low temperatures,
oxygen addition to the radical R¢ is dominant, forming the RO2¢
radical. Then isomerization of RO2¢ forms ¢QOOH, which can con-
duct a series of chain branching reactions to produce 2 ¢OH radi-
cals and oxygenated species (¢QOOH þ O2!¢OOQOOH!HOOQ-
HO þ OH!¢OQ-HO þ 2¢OH). With increasing temperature, the oxy-
gen addition reactions shift back to the decomposition direction,
thus weakening the low-temperature chain branching. Mean-
while, at intermediate and higher temperatures, decomposition
of the low-temperature intermediates (e.g., RO2¢ and ¢QOOH) and
the R¢ radical gradually becomes more competitive and generates
including alkenes, HO2¢, cyclic ethers, and
different products,
other alkyl radicals. The enhanced decomposition of R, RO2, and
QOOH radicals at intermediate temperatures, together with the
backward shift of the low-temperature entrance channel, reduces
the global chemical reactivity in the NTC regime [177(cid:1)179]. A
typical example of NTC phenomena on ignition delay times in an
adiabatic homogeneous model is shown in Fig. 4 [180]. However,
the oxidation of aromatic and olefinic molecules does not follow
the general
thus NTC
low-temperature reaction competition,
phenomena are not that prominent for these fuels.

PFor combustion researchers ignition delay times are usually used
to investigate the reactivity in terms of auto-ignition propensity at
various temperature and pressure conditions. There is an inherent
correlation among the ignition index, ignition delay times, and the
combustion chemistry. The difference between RON and MON is the
octane sensitivity, and it is related to how the chemical reactivity of
the fuel changes with pressure and temperature. The slope of the
NTC region in the S-shaped ignition curve is another indicator of
changing reactivity. Some scatter is present in the correlation
between the sensitivity and the slope of the NTC region for a wide
range of isooctane/n-heptane/toluene/1-hexene surrogate mixtures,
as shown in Fig. 5(a) [160], but a definite trend that sensitivity
increases with increasing slope can be observed. This can be
explained by the fact that the unsaturated components (aromatics
and olefins) have a larger impact on the sensitivity of gasoline fuels.
On the other hand, a high overall reactivity, which is due to the avail-

Fig. 4. Total ignition delay as a function of the initial temperature T for a stoichiomet-
ric n-heptane/air mixture under various pressure (Reprinted from [180] with permis-
sion of Elsevier).

Pability of relatively rapid reaction pathways, can be reflected either
by a low AKI (OI with K = 0.5), or by a short ignition delay time in the
middle of the NTC region. A strong correlation between AKI and the
ignition delay time can be observed in Fig. 5(b) [160]. This phenome-
non indicates a possible reason why RON is larger than MON for gas-
oline and most non-PRF fuels. Namely, because the slope of the NTC
region for most fuels is larger than that for isooctane and n-heptane.
Thus, with increasing intake temperature, the operating condition
shifts from the RON test to the MON test, the promotion of the over-
all reactivity before ignition is more significant for most fuels than
for isooctane and n-heptane (There might even be a negative effect
on reactivity for PRF due to the NTC region). To compensate for the
extra reactivity, more n-heptane, which is more reactive than isooc-
tane, is needed when matching the same knock behavior in the MON
test compared with the RON test, which means that the composition
of isooctane in a PRF mixture should be less, and the octane number
is lower, too.

2.3. Intermediate species and auto-ignition front

PSome important intermediate species (CH, CHO, CH2O and OH)
can be used as markers of different combustion phases based on
the fuel's low-temperature and high-temperature hydrocarbon
oxidation chemistry. This information provides quantitative data
of temperature and reactivity for understanding the knocking
combustion process. Schießl et al. [87] investigated spatial species
distributions and temperature fluctuations in the unburned end-

Pgas of a SI engine by laser-induced fluorescence, as shown in
Fig. 6. The dark area indicates the burned zone due to an absence
of fluorescing intermediate species and they identified auto-igni-
tion hotspots at a few localized sites of increased temperature.
Furthermore, the authors converted spatial formaldehyde (CH2O)
concentration variations in the end gas to temperature fluctua-
tions, and it was found that temperature fluctuations exceeding
20 K were present in the nominally homogeneous end-gas. This
also provides quantitive evidence of temperature stratification in
end-gas before engine knock.

PFurther investigations in optical engines using spectroscopic
measurements [85] and chemiluminesence [86] were also conducted.
Flame structures, intermediate species and pressure evolution during
SI knocking combustion have been visualized. Radical species such as
OH and CHO were detected and were correlated to the onset and
duration of knock and the presence of hot-spots in the end gas [85].
It was found that the occurrence of the CHO radical in the end gas
denoted the start of knocking combustion and OH marked the
burned zone, as shown in Fig. 7. Using light emission and the absorp-
tion wavelengths of CH2O, cool flame reactions in the unburnt gas
were detected [90]. Using CH2O and OH chemiluminescence synchro-
nous with the pressure trace [86], it was found that the first auto-
ignition occurs near the spark ignited flame front in slight knocking
cases. Combustion images and heat release data indicate that a sig-
nificant pressure gradient occurred in a local area because of end-gas
auto-ignition with a constant volume-like heat release.

PFor auto-ignition front propagation during knocking combus-
tion, studies have revealed different patterns. Besides near-wall

Pauto-ignition, as shown in Fig. 6, a flame-induced sequential auto-
ignition (FIAI) pattern was also reported in a spark-ignition engine
by high speed direct photography [86]. The auto-ignition occurs
near the flame front with an apparent propagation speed of
approximately 160 m/s, which is one order of magnitude higher
than the normal turbulent flame speed in spark ignition engine,
but much less than the local sound speed of approximately
700 m/s. Therefore, the local significant pressure increase does not
occur due to pressure equilibrium, and no obvious pressure oscil-
lation was observed in the combustion chamber. After spark igni-
tion, a deflagrative flame propagates at the turbulent flame speed.
With the compression of the deflagration, the unburned mixture
temperature and pressure increase to the mode transition status.
As a result, the flame front propagation abruptly accelerates to a
high speed due to sequential auto-ignition. By using 1D simula-
tions, similar phenomena have been revealed [181]. For reaction
front-base temperatures below 1100 K, end-gas combustion was
dictated by a transport-controlled deflagration processes. Beyond
this reaction front-base temperature,
transport had minimal
effects on the front propagation rate and the combustion process
could be described by a “spontaneous ignition front propagation
regime”. Kawahara and Tomita et al. [182] investigated auto-
ignited kernels during knocking combustion. They found that
when the end gas was compressed due to the propagating flame
front, auto-ignited kernels appeared near regions with negative
curvature of the flame front, as shown in Fig. 8. The authors con-
cluded that the negative curvature was caused by the initiation of
the auto-ignited kernel.

PGenerally speaking, detonation is unlikely to occur in a naturally
aspirated SI engine due to the low heat release rate, short chamber-
wall distances and cool cylinder walls. From the literature, after the
observations done by Miller and his colleagues [83], evidence about
detonation during knock in engines was not published until 1991 by
Spicher et al. [81]. It was found that high knock intensities seem to
be related to shock waves. To observe the process at higher fre-
quency, Pan et al. [183] recorded a set of images at 240,000 fps with
the engine operating at 1000 rpm on a PRF90 fuel, and the ignition
front from an auto-ignition center was observed developing at
896 m/s. Their numerical results showed that the development of
the auto-ignition front could reach 1500 m/s. Both the experimental
and numerical speeds were less than the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ)
speed, but much higher than normal flame speeds in an engine.
Supersonic waves propagated and reflected from the walls in the
combustion chamber, which led to pressure oscillations.

2.4. Pressure oscillation and heat transfer

PPressure oscillation in a cavity is a fundamental scientific phe-
nomenon. For combustion systems, thermo-acoustic excitation is
commonly observed, which may lead to pressure oscillations and
combustion instabilities [184,185].

PTo capture oscillation patterns under IC engine-like conditions, a
novel method was developed [76] using CH¢ emission based on
high-speed chemiluminescence images during the combustion pro-
cess. By reconstructing the images with the three basic color intensi-
ties of each pixel replaced by the amplitudes of the luminosity
spectrum, mode shapes of the pressure oscillations in a cylindrical
cavity were clearly obtained. Table 4 lists the first 5 modes,
along with the theoretical ones (Draper's "drum mode" [186]).
According to the amplitudes of the luminosity spectrum, pres-
sure oscillation was mainly from the first resonant mode and the
oscillating energy is focused at a fixed frequency (e.g. 7.2 kHz
with bore of 79 mm [70]).

PPressure oscillation also influences heat transfer. To take the
oscillating flow field into account, a new wall heat transfer model
was developed using a pressure gradient correction [70]. In addition,

Pan energy source term was introduced to reflect the chemical heat
release from near-wall reactions. The new wall heat flux formulation
is given as [70],

where the first term in the numerator is the standard wall heat flux
formulation of Han et al. [69] and the second term accounts for
pressure fluctuations, @p/@t, and near-wall heat release, Qc. Pressure
oscillation-induced flows significantly enhance convective heat
transfer. The energy loss via heat transfer was predicted to be nearly
40% of total fuel energy under heavy knocking conditions [70].
Therefore, heavy knock not only may lead to damage of engine com-
ponents, but also significantly reduces thermal efficiency due to
enhanced heat transfer.

PMoreover, the pressure oscillation may couple with chemical
kinetics. Fig. 9 shows pressure, temperature, fuel, CHO, and NOx dis-
tributions during the knocking combustion process [187]. A high
concentration of OH radicals is formed in the center of the cylinder
during the post-oxidation stage. A high concentration of CHO radi-
cals is seen around the OH radicals, which indicates that auto-
ignition of the end gas is about to take place. The local in-cylinder
pressure is extremely uneven, as shown in the pressure distribution,
during the knocking combustion process. The knocking combustion
is related to local auto-ignition and pressure wave reflection near
the walls. It was found that the 1st auto-ignition spot occurs ahead
of the flame front because the end-gas mixture closer to the flame
front has higher temperatures. Then the local pressure rises rapidly
due to volumetric heat release, which generates a pressure wave, as
shown in the pressure distribution. Pressure-wave induced negative
curvature can be seen from the turbulent flame front (black curve
captured by the G-equation combustion model) due to auto-ignited
kernels near the flame front, as reported by Kawahara and Tomita
et al. [182]. Then the pressure wave propagates and impinges on the
cylinder wall. Note that this pressure wave is reflected with double
its amplitude at walls, as shown in the pressure distribution.
The double-amplitude pressure rapidly compresses the near wall

Punburned gas to very high temperatures and significantly shortens
its ignition delay. Thus, a 2nd auto-ignition occurs with much more
pressure rise intensity near walls. This autoignition-induced flow
pushes back the spark-ignited flame front and creates a further neg-
ative curvature. In addition, detonation could be initiated near the
walls in IC engines if the energy density is high enough. This will be
further elucidated in Sections 4 and 5.

3. Super-knock in boosted SI engines

PIn recent decades use of high boost has been developed to offer
the potential of enhancing power density and reducing fuel con-
sumption in gasoline SI engines [188]. The developments, especially
in the low-speed and high-load regime, have however been chal-
lenged by the occurrence of a new mode of engine knock, super-
knock [189], which has been variously termed as unwanted pre-igni-
tion [190], mega knock [191], LSPI (low-speed pre-ignition) [192],
deto-knock [2], SPI (stochastic pre-ignition) [193], developing deto-
nation [194,195] or subsequent front propagation [196]. Such a sin-
gle super-knock event can severely and instantaneously damage an
engine due to the extremely high peak pressure and the associated
pressure oscillations that are developed. Furthermore, super-knock
events appear randomly with little direct relationship to engine con-
trol parameters, such as ignition timing, equivalence ratio, intake
temperature, etc. Applying common knock suppression methods,
such as retarding spark timing, cooling the intake charge and
enhancing heat transfer, are not effective at avoiding super-knock.
Therefore, super-knock is at present the major obstacle for further
improving the boost level of turbo-charged SI engines.

PFig. 10 shows the typical pressure trace and heat release rate of a
normal combustion cycle, a conventional knock cycle, and a super-
knock cycle. In highly boosted gasoline engines, the spark timing is
usually retarded even after TDC to avoid conventional knock at low
speed, high load conditions. The most significant difference between
super-knock and conventional knock is the amplitude of the

Ppressure rise at knock onset. The amplitude of the maximum pres-
sure rise of super-knock (4p) is more than an order of magnitude
higher than for conventional knock.

3.1. Relationship between super-knock and pre-ignition

PSuper-knock phenomena are significantly different from those of
the conventional knock, indicating that they have a different com-
bustion process. Many studies have been conducted to investigate
super-knock [2(cid:1)4,70,119,191,193,197-209], and it
is generally
accepted that super-knock originates from pre-ignition.

P3.1.1. Distinguish pre-ignition and super-knock

PIn the existing literature both “super-knock” and “pre-ignition”
are used to describe the engine knock observed under low-speed,
high-load conditions in boosted gasoline engines. Although some-
times interchangeable, they actually represent two different com-
bustion phenomena. “Pre-ignition” represents the combustion of the
air/fuel mixture triggered by a “hot spot”, other than an electric
spark prior to the spark time. Researchers usually use “pre-ignition
frequency” to evaluate the quality of a boosted gasoline engine com-
bustion system. Peak pressure (pz, higher than 10.5 MPa [153]) or
peak-to-peak pressure oscillation (ppmax, higher than 8.3 times of
permitted knock amplitude [200]) was used as a criterion to capture
pre-ignition events. However, pre-ignition may cause different com-
bustion phenomena, including non-knocking combustion. It is diffi-
cult to identify pre-ignition using the above knock detection
methods. “Super-knock” is named to distinguish itself from conven-
tional knock. Conventional knock is due to end-gas auto-ignition
before spark-triggered flame propagation consumes the end gas in
the combustion chamber. Super-knock, however, is severe engine
knock triggered by sporadical pre-ignition. Super-knock, which can
be characterized using the peak pressure value (pz) or the amplitude
of pressure rise (Dp), as shown in Fig. 10(a), can be a direct induce-
ment of engine damage. Moreover, super-knock occurs randomly.

Fig. 9. SI combustion simulation at three representative timings during the knocking process (adapted from [187]) (Black curve: turbulent flame front).

PTo capture super-knock cycles, enough engine cycles (5000 cycles
[2]) have to be recorded continuously, as shown in Fig. 10(b).

PThe relationship between pre-ignition, conventional knock, and
super-knock in a boosted gasoline engine is summarized in Fig. 11.
SI combustion can be divided into normal combustion and engine
knock according to the value of the pressure oscillation. Engine
knock can be classified into conventional knock and super-knock

Paccording to the value of the peak pressure rise. Two types of super-
knock are end-gas deflagration and end-gas detonation according to
the precise combustion wave mode. Thus, pre-ignition is the origin
of abnormal combustion. Pre-ignition can lead to end-gas detonation
(super-knock), end-gas deflagration (super-knock, heavy knock, and
slight knock) and normal flame propagation (non-knock). The com-
bustion wave mode will be further discussed in Section 4.

PTo sum up, pre-ignition and super-knock are totally different
combustion phenomena. Pre-ignitions do not always lead to super-
knock. Pre-ignition may lead to super-knock, heavy-knock, slight-
knock, and non-knock. Super-knock directly damages an engine
while pre-ignition does not. Since super-knock combustion always
has pre-ignition events occurring before spark timing, one of the
effective ways to avoid super-knock is to eliminate pre-ignition.

P3.1.2. Possible sources of pre-ignition before super-knock

PPre-ignition has been observed in gasoline spark ignited engines
over the past 70 years [193,210(cid:1)212]. According to the different
sources of pre-ignition, the causes of pre-ignition can be divided
into structured hot spots (such as the spark plug, valves, etc.) and
unstructured hot spots (such as oil droplets, particles in the combus-
tion chamber, etc.). When there is a structured hot spot in the com-
bustion chamber, it can increase the local temperature, and this has
been called run-away pre-ignition [1]. This kind of phenomenon can
be avoided by optimizing the combustion chamber design. However,
the pre-ignition, which can develop into super-knock, is not a homo-
geneous gas combustion process. It has been found that pre-ignition
occurs via an obvious flame kernel growth and a flame propagation

Pprocess [3,202]. Simulation results also show that even in low speed
pre-ignition (LSPI) cases, the ignition delay of the stoichiometric
mixture is still long, and the mixture cannot pre-ignite spontane-
ously before spark ignition [119]. Therefore, LSPI is associated with
hot spots. Super-knock is different from run-away pre-ignition in its
combustion characteristics.

P“Pre-ignition” is generally accepted to be due to three possible
inducements, including surface ignition, lubricating oil, and carbon
deposits. A protrusion on the chamber surfaces may become a hot-
spot to induce pre-ignition. However, surface ignition cannot explain
the occurrence of a random pre-ignition location in the combustion
chamber and the occasional super-knock event.

PSurface-ignition-induced pre-ignition can be ruled out in super-
knock cycles. By evaluating endoscope data, Dahnz et al. [117] first
excluded the theory that the spatial distribution of pre-ignition ori-
gins could be structured due to hot spots. Each black dot in Fig. 12
indicates the starting point of one optically registered auto-ignition
site. To facilitate orientation, the visible combustion chamber out-
lines are also sketched on the background of the image. As can be
seen, the pre-ignition origins are spread over a wide range in the
plane of the cylinder head gasket. Detailed analyses showed no sig-
nificant correlation between the engine operating conditions and
the distributions of pre-ignition origin. Furthermore, the influence of
the spark plug characteristics on super-knock was investigated
[197] and it was concluded that the tendency for super-knock is not
influenced by the location of the spark plug.

PThe causes of pre-ignition may relate to the lubricating oil, gaso-
line/oil mixing [2,191,203,213], floating deposits [202,204], gas-
phase auto-ignition [189,205], and fuel properties [149,201,202].
Carbon deposit coatings increasing pre-ignition frequency has also

Pbeen demonstrated. A clean combustion chamber without carbon
deposits clearly shifts the pressure level at which pre-ignition occurs
to higher values [200]. Injections too early during the intake stroke
lead to spray impingement on the piston bowl and the correspond-
ing increased soot emission has a strong relationship with the
super-knock frequency [204]. Combustion visualizations and CFD
simulations on the onset of pre-ignition, including liner wetting,
injection targeting, stratification, mixture motion, and oil formula-
tion, have identified oil mixing with the fuel as the leading reason
for pre-ignition [153]. Moreover, the stochastic nature of oil intru-
sion into the combustion chamber may induce pre-ignition.

3.2. Source analysis of pre-ignition

P3.2.1. Oil droplets

PThe formulation of engine oil, which contains a base oil, deter-
gent, dispersant, antioxidant, corrosion inhibitor and emulsifier, is
complex. When an oil droplet enters the combustion chamber, it can
become a hotspot because part of its component mixture may have
a shorter ignition delay. The oil droplet can thus self-ignite before
ignition under the proper temperature and pressure conditions, and
this can initiate an air-fuel mixture which leads to pre-ignition, and
finally super-knock.

PDahnz et al. [202] first proposed the mechanism of lubricant oil
droplet release from the cylinder liner, which has turned out to be
the most probable explanation for the occurrence of pre-ignition.
Pre-ignition is triggered by long-chain lubricating oil components
that have shorter ignition delays [4]. The mechanism for auto-igni-
tion of oil droplets from a piston crevice is shown in Fig. 13(a) [152].
Oil droplets accumulate in the piston crevice area and then vaporize
in the combustion chamber. The process from an oil drop to the for-
mation of a combustible mixture around an oil drop is illustrated in
Fig. 13(b) [214]. An oil particle becomes an igniter only when a com-
bustible gaseous mixture around it can be formed and the mixture
temperature reaches that for auto ignition. Finally, oil/fuel/air mix-
ture self-ignition in the cylinder causes pre-ignition.

PThe hypothesis about the relationship of knock and oil intrusion
has been verified quite extensively. Oil intrusion before TDC could
indeed induce pre-ignition and then knock; and slightly diluted oil
(75% oil þ 25% gasoline) caused the heaviest knock [215]. Lubricant-
based, low-ignition delay components being carried into the com-
bustion chamber during blow-down could survive to become a pre-
ignition origin in a subsequent cycle [216]. Single oil droplet ignition
that precedes the ignition of the fuel-air mixture has been observed
in a rapid compression expansion machine [217]. Pre-ignition
induced by lubricant has been observed when a lubricant is directly
introduced into the combustion chamber [218]. Under 1.4 MPa and
710 K conditions, the oil droplet ignited first in a stoichiometric iso-
octane / air mixture, and then initiated combustion in the surround-
ing air-fuel mixture leading to flame propagation [219]. This
phenomenon is not observed when oil droplets are absent as the
combustion phase occurs distinctly earlier with oil droplets ignition.

P3.2.2. Solid particle

POil droplets are not the only inducement of pre-ignition. Floating
solid particles in the combustion chamber also have a close connec-
tion with pre-ignition. Particle formation is related to the nature of
the fuel, engine design and the operating conditions. As a product of
incomplete combustion, particles can stay in the combustion cham-
ber and participate in surface oxidation reactions in the next cycle.
In addition, they can also serve directly as high temperature spots to
ignite the mixture.

Increasing spray/wall

PPre-ignition is associated with the conditions to increase the
accumulation rate of deposits. Less pre-ignition is observed after
clean preconditioning than in a dirty engine combustion cham-
ber [200].
interaction strongly increases
the probability of pre-ignition events [151]. The pre-ignition is
presumably caused by self-ignition of some (still unidentified)
substances originating from the lubricant or from lubricant/fuel
spray interaction. The relevant species may not initially be pres-
ent in the fuel or in the lubricant, but could be formed in the
combustion chamber by incomplete combustion. At certain

Pinjection timings, cylinder liner wall wetting was noticeably
present, and a large amount of deposits were observed after the
engine was operated under those conditions [220]. The number
of LSPIs in a sequence increased under conditions that caused
large amounts of cylinder liner wall wetting.

PBased on these test results and considerations, Fig. 14 shows a
new proposed LSPI mechanism [207]. Deposits formed by cylinder
liner wall wetting (A) and deposits formed at low engine loads over
extended periods of time (B) peel off and float in the combustion
chamber space (C). Deposits exposed to combustion are burned and
increase in temperature (D). However, although the flame is extin-
guished between the expansion and exhaust strokes (E), gradual

Psurface reactions with unburned oxygen continue. High-tempera-
ture deposits in the residual gases that remain in the next cycle are
exposed to new oxygen in the intake stroke of the next cycle. The
high-pressure and high-temperature of the compression stroke
combine with the internal heat to accelerate the surface oxidizing
reactions, creating the glowing particles that were observed (F).
When the energy required for ignition of the surrounding mixture is
discharged, the mixture starts to combust (i.e., flame propagation
occurs) (G).

PSimilar findings can be found in Kuboyama et al. [221], Lauer
et al. [222], Moriyoshi et al. [223], and Magar et al. [224]. In the
research of Ref. [221], pre-ignition caused by glowing particles was

Pobserved by direct photography, as shown in Fig. 14(b). The glowing
particles induced pre-ignition followed by heat release and pressure
oscillation. In the research of Magar et al. [224], evidence enabling
the identification of the trigger of premature, local auto-ignition was
found. Their optical results reveal that pre-ignition is initiated in the
immediate vicinity of glowing solid particles. The particles are either
a result of the flaking of deposits, or of contamination of the combus-
tion chamber.

PThere is a correlation between soot emissions and super-
knock. Higher in-cylinder soot emission correlated well with the
frequency of pre-ignition and super-knock cycles in a GDI pro-
duction engine (Fig. 15(a)) [204]. To validate the hypothesis of
soot particle-induced pre-ignition, carbon particles with different
temperatures and sizes were introduced into the combustion
chamber to trigger pre-ignition and super-knock, as shown in
Fig. 15(b) [225]. The results indicate that large-diameter carbon
particles directly lead to pre-ignition and super-knock phenom-
ena. This can be explained by the fact that the bigger carbon par-
ticles could form an ignition kernel, and be more prone to be the
source of heat imbalances. An incipient flame must reach a criti-
cal radius before it becomes self-sustaining [226]. When the ker-
nel size is larger than the laminar flame thickness at the local
temperature and pressure, pre-ignition is initiated [4,226]. The
experimental data suggest that agglomerated soot particles with
higher temperatures and larger sizes detached from the piston
bowl surface could be one of the inducements of pre-ignition
and super-knock.

PIn addition to deposits and soot, sulphated ash [227] and wear
metals such as Fe and Cu [148], also contribute to increased pre-igni-
tion frequency due to catalytic effects.

3.3. The effect of oil and fuel properties on super-knock

PResearch on super-knock has indicated that the composition and
physicochemical properties of the oil and fuel also affect seriously
the frequency of super-knock.

P3.3.1. Oil properties

P3.3.1.1. Base stocks.
PPre-ignitions were thought to arise from local
auto-ignition of areas in the cylinder which are rich in low ignition
delay “contaminants”, such as engine oil and/or heavy ends of gaso-
line [228]. These contaminants are introduced into the combustion
chamber at various points in the engine cycle. In general, less reac-
tive base stocks (i.e., those with a long ignition delay) appeared to
have the lowest ignition tendency. The calculated ignition index
(CII), which is an estimate of heavy hydrocarbon reactivity based on
empirical measurements from bunker fuels, was found to predict
the ignition tendency of group I-IV lubricant base stocks (Fig. 16).

PMany researchers have noted that oil additives
P3.3.1.2. Oil additives.
correlated directly with the frequency of super-knock due to
possible catalytic reactions. The frequency of LSPI (super-knock)
increased with the content of additives [151,153]. The detergent Ca
has a contributory effect, and MoDTC or ZnDTP have a preventative
effect on LSPI [148,152,229,230]. A new engine oil formulation has
been developed [147], which reduced LSPI frequency to less than
10% of that of conventional ILSAC certified gasoline engine oils. High
quality base oils and optimized additive components were formu-
lated in which the amount of calcium-based detergent was reduced
to levels lower than that in general ILSAC oils, and anti-oxidants
were added. Based on these findings, a correlation to estimate LSPI
frequency (relative) was obtained:

(cid:6) þ 1:69

(cid:6)(cid:1)26:6 ¢ P wt%1⁄2

(cid:6)(cid:1)5:12 ¢ Mo wt%1⁄2

LSPI frequency 1⁄4 6:59 ¢ Ca wt%1⁄2

ð6Þ
PIn an assessment of engine oil degradation effects, the influence
of wear metals and engine oil degradation was also investigated. It
was found that addition of Fe and Cu compounds clearly showed
contributory effects on LSPI
In addition, the
observed auto-ignition frequency decreased with increasing viscos-
ity and density, which is related to the physical property of the addi-
tives [228].

frequency [148].

PHowever, so far the reported work does not provide an explicit
conclusion about the effect of oil additives. For example, there is no
consensus on whether Zn and Mo have effects on pre-ignition
[152,231]. This is because pre-ignition in engine production is ran-
dom and oil additive effects are only one of the possible pre-ignition
sources. To isolate the effect of oil additive on pre-ignition, a single
factor experimental method needs to be developed to reproduce
pre-ignition and super-knock in a research engine [149]. This repre-
sents a promising area for future research work, as developing inhib-
ited additives could provide solutions for suppressing pre-ignition
and super-knock.

P3.3.2. Fuel properties

PThe fuel's chemical composition, octane number and volatility
have effects on the frequency of super-knock. On one hand, the
quality of the fuel directly influences the ignition properties of
the mixture. On the other hand, fuel droplets may play a role in the
origin and progress of pre-ignition.

PThe effect of fuel composition on super-knock
P3.3.2.1. Composition.
was experimentally investigated in a boosted direct-injection gaso-
line engine [201,232,233]. Despite similar RON and MON ratings, the
super-knock characteristics of the test fuels in direct injection SI
engines were different. Fuel blends with high levels of aromatics
increase super-knock frequency, whereas a low aromatic fuel and
E10 (10% mass of ethanol) reduced super-knock frequency under dif-
ferent test conditions of A/F ratios and EGR levels, as shown in
Fig. 17. For the aromatic content, it was found to correlate strongly
with super-knock frequency. Moreover, a lower limit for the aro-
matic content was found by Andrew et al. [232]: as aromatic content
was increased from 15 to 35% the super-knock frequency increased
from zero to »100 events in 135,000 cycles. Below 15% no super-
knock behavior was detected even for the highest load conditions.

PIn essence, the fact that a high aromatic content increases the
super-knock frequency can be explained by two main reasons. Aro-
matic combustion leads to soot formation and enhanced deposits,
and these solid particles are possible sources of pre-ignition for
super-knock, as discussed in Section 3.2.2: Solid particle. Moreover,
soot and deposits also coat the surface of the combustion chamber,
which resists heat transfer from walls. The reduced heat transfer
leads to higher temperatures and pressures in-cylinder before spark
timing, which also promotes pre-ignition. For ethanol addition, this
influences the latent heat and flame propagation and will be further
discussed in the following Section: Octane number.

P3.3.1.2. Octane number.
PFuel octane number has comprehensive
effects on pre-ignition and super-knock. Most experiments in the lit-
erature show that there is no correlation between pre-ignition pro-
pensity and RON or MON. Some experiments show that pre-ignition
frequency decreases with increased octane number [202,234]. Pre-
ignition temperature tends to be higher with increasing RON, and
pre-ignition temperature is more related to RON than MON [199].
However, it was found that ethanol had a relatively high pre-ignition
tendency with high intake manifold pressure, although its octane
numbers (RON and MON) are particularly high [235]. This can be
explained by the fact that fuels like ethanol and hydrogen are very
susceptible to pre-ignition because of their high laminar burning
velocities [3,236,237] and smaller laminar flame thickness. A stable
flame can be established if the kernel radius is sufficiently larger

Pthan the laminar flame thickness [238]. On the other hand, lower
super-knock tendency with ethanol fuel than gasoline fuel may be
thanks to the higher heat of evaporation of ethanol. To sum up, pre-
ignition with a high octane number fuel might not lead to super-
knock due to its higher resistance to auto-ignition.

P3.3.1.3. Volatility.
PA higher frequency of pre-ignition was observed
for a fuel featuring a higher fraction of low volatility compounds.
Fuels that had a distillation point of T50 below 103 °C showed a
lower number of stochastic pre-ignition (SPI) events [193], as shown
in Fig. 18. Fuel distillation points (T90 and T95) also have effects on
LSPI frequency. It was concluded that a heavier fuel could lead to an
increase in LSPI tendency [229]. This conclusion is consistent with
the theory that high boiling point fuel components can cause more
liner wetting [239] due to poorer atomization of the fuel spray and
slower evaporation after adhesion on the wall, potentially leading to
more fuel accumulation in crevices and higher LSPI frequency. More
references on the effect of oil volatility on pre-ignition can be found
in Palaveev et al. [151], Zheng et al. [240], Dahnz et al. [202], Zahdeh
et al. [153], Sasaki et al. [241], Hamilton et al. [242], Chan et al. [243].
and Li et al. [234].

PFuel additives also affect pre-ignition. A cleaning detergent was
added to standard RON 95 pump fuel with the intention of reducing
the deposits in the combustion chamber. However, pre-ignitions
were found to be higher by a factor of 3 because a kerosene type sol-
vent was used as part of the additive package. The poor evaporation
with an evaporation range of 150(cid:1)300 °C was thought to be the
major driver for the increased soot formation and the resulting high
pre-ignition frequency [153].

4. Combustion mode of engine knock

PAs discussed above, engine knock is associated with auto-ignition
in the end gas [1]. In terms of auto-ignition evolution in a reactive
gas, Zel'dovich [244] classified four modes: (1) near thermal explo-
sion without a shock wave: where usp > Dcj >> a, (2) detonation
propagating supersonically: Dcj (cid:2) usp > a, (3) deflagration propagat-
ing subsonically: a > usp > uf, and (4) a normal flame propagating by
molecular diffusive and conductive mechanisms: usp ffi uf. Gu and
Bradley et al. [98] extended the auto-ignition theory to consider
temperature gradients (hot spots). Using 1-D DNS for syngas/air
with detailed chemistry, they demonstrated five propagation modes
of auto-ignition fronts: (1) thermal explosion, (2) supersonic auto-
ignitive deflagration, (3) developing and developed detonation,
(4) subsonic autoignitive deflagration, and (5) conventional laminar
burning deflagration. Bradley [98] proposed two dimensionless

Pparameters, e and ξ. e is the ratio of the residence time of the acous-
tic wave in the hot spot to the short excitation time in which most of
the chemical energy is released, and ξ is the ratio of the acoustic
speed to the localized autoignitive velocity. The hot spot induced
combustion mode can be plotted by a peninsula on the e-ξ diagram.
Kalghatgi et al. [4] applied the above method to super-knock analy-
sis, and pointed out super-knock cases were located in the “develop-
ing detonation” zone in the e-ξ diagram (see Fig. 19). In addition
to the above two parameters, Rudloff et al. [95] proposed a third
parameter, p, which is the ratio of the experimental pressure rise
after super-knock to the theoretical pressure rise based on isochoric
combustion, to discern super-knock. It was found that super knock
is often located in the region with high e and low ξ.

PBased on the above theoretical framework, numerical simulation
and experimental investigations on the combustion modes of engine
knock were also carried out to explain super-knock occurrence. To
consider large hydrocarbon fuels with negative temperature coeffi-
cient (NTC) behavior, Dai and Chen [99] carried out 1-D CFD numeri-
cal experiments on reaction front propagation in n-heptane/air
mixtures. It was found that shock compression of the mixture
between the deflagration wave and the leading shock wave produces
an additional ignition kernel, which determines the autoignition
modes. To consider high-octane fuels in highly boosted gasoline
engines, Wang and He et al. [2] carried out engine tests with gasoline
fuel under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. It was
found that a hot-spot in the unburned end-gas mixture at tempera-
ture and pressure conditions above a so-called ‘‘deto-curve’’ may
induce detonation. Kalghatgi and Bradley [4] attributed super-knock
to developing detonations which originate from a resonance
between acoustic waves emitted by an auto-igniting “hot spot” and
a reaction wave, which propagates along negative temperature gra-
dients in the fuel-air mixture. Robert et al. [56] placed the calculated
e and ξ for the grid points close to autoignition on e-ξ diagram in a
LES study on knock prediction, and found that the possible existence
of a DDT seems to be in good agreement with the evolution of knock
intensity with spark timing. Bates et al. [245] used another parame-
ter, E, which is defined by E = (ti/te)(E/RT), to insert contours of
hot spot temperature elevations on the e-ξ diagram. The different
regimes for hot spot auto-ignition, extending from controlled auto-
ignition at one limit, through the development of knock to super-
knock, could be identified through the values of ti, te, and E on the
e-ξ diagram.

PSuper-knock is stochastic phenomena and should be explained
based on the nature of cyclical changes, including for example, tem-
perature gradients, species stratification, and turbulent mixing in
the mixture. Kalghatgi et al. [238] indicated that stochastic processes
can affect knock intensity (KI) which will be dependent on both Z (a
parameter that depends on the pressure at knock onset timing) and
@x/@T (temperature gradient in a hot spot) with cycle-to-cycle varia-
tions. However, Peters et al. [205] ascribed the stochastic occurrence
of pre-ignition and the resulting “super-knock” events to the
stochastic nature of turbulence based on a 2D Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS).

PTo provide deep insights into the combustion process and reveal
the combustion mode in the end gas, combustion visualization is the
most direct method, as described next.

4.1. Visualization of combustion modes in the end gas

in SI

PAlthough numerous efforts to visualize the pre-ignition to
super-knock process
engines have been conducted
[153,203,218,220,222], very few direct experimental observations
have been reported that would allow quantitative analysis of a
super-knock event because super-knock occurs at high loads, which
are usually beyond the operating conditions of optical engines. This
problem can be solved by using a Rapid Compression Machine
(RCM) with optical accessibility to simulate conditions similar to
those within internal combustion engines.

PRecently, Tsinghua University [77,78,179,246,247] carried out
extensive RCM experiments to study the auto-ignition of isooctane.
While most of the experiments exhibited HCCI-like combustion, a
few combustion processes with pre-ignition and denotation induced
by unknown randomly distributed particles were observed [248].
Enlighten by the randomly observed detonation process, a system-
atic study of reproducing the super-knock combustion process [78]
was conducted using a spark to create pre-ignition in the RCM
(Fig. 20) to capture the deflagration-to-detonation transition. It was
found the amplitude of the pressure oscillations varies depending on
the thermodynamic conditions. Different combustion modes of the
end gas, including no-autoignition, sequential autoignition, and det-
onation were observed. Fig. 21 shows three typical image sequences
corresponding to three combustion modes. Fig. 22 shows the
corresponding pressures, heat releases and detonation waves.

P4.1.1. No-auto-ignition

PWhen the initial pressure is low, the pressure trace is smooth.
After spark ignition, a flame propagates out from the cylinder center.
Once the flame front arrives at the cylinder walls, the combustion
ends. Thus, no auto-ignition was observed in the end gas as shown
in Fig. 21(a). This is a flame propagation case, like in the normal
engine combustion cycle.

P4.1.2. End gas sequential auto-ignition

PAs the initial pressure increases, the heat release rate shows a
second peak before the end of combustion. This 2nd heat release
peak leads to a several bar pressure oscillation, which is similar to
that in the conventional knock cycle. Such an amplitude pressure
oscillation causes a small variation in image luminosity. The
increases in image luminosity and pressure oscillation are due to the
end-gas autoignition, as shown in Fig. 21(b) in the blue areas on the
top right of the images from (3) to (6). No flame front propagation
was observed after auto-ignition, which is due to the sequential
autoignition of the surrounding gases.

P4.1.3. Detonation

PFor the case of high initial pressure, a steep pressure rise of more
than 10 MPa occurs within a short time of 0.02 ms. Then, significant
pressure oscillations were observed with an amplitude exceeding

P8 MPa. This phenomenon is a typical super-knock. Consecutive
images near the start of the pressure oscillation are shown in Fig. 21
(c). A bright area appears near the top of the cylinder at the time of
Image B, indicating a auto-ignition zone. At the time of Image C,
a clear flame front with bright blue color is observed which
propagates downward.

PFig. 22 also presents the propagation paths of the combustion
wave. From image C to F, the average propagation speed swept
by the left wing of the combustion wave front along the wall is
1847 m/s (Path 1). The propagation speed swept by the right wing of
the combustion wave front along the wall is 1917 m/s (Path 4). Since
the Chapman-Jouguet detonation speed (DCJ) for the end gas is pre-
dicted to be 1867 m/s, the bright blue flame from Image C to Image
H is clearly a self-sustained detonation wave.

PIn SI engines the end gas can be subjected to isentropic com-
pression until knock onset by assuming that heat loss is negligi-
ble. For the typical super-knock cycle [2], both pai and Tai of
super-knock in the engine are higher than for the detonation
case in the RCM, and the super-knock engine cycle exhibits even
higher amplitudes of pressure oscillations, thus the high pressure
oscillation of the super-knock is due to detonation. This conclu-
sion is also supported by the intensity parameter proposed by
Rudloff et al. [95], which was calculated using pressure ratio to
characterize a super-knock:

PThe calculated p in the RCM case (Fig. 21(c)) is 1.97. The pressure
rise is much higher than that of isochoric combustion. Correspond-
ingly, the calculated p for the engine super-knock cycle (Cycle 1388
in Fig. 11(a) in Ref. [2]) is 2.58, even higher than the confirmed deto-
nation case in the RCM. Thus, the 1388 engine super-knock cycle is
identified as detonation.

4.2. Analysis of the process from pre-ignition to super-knock

PTo further analyze the process of super-knock, a random pre-
ignition event and the following super-knock combustion process
under high temperature and high pressure conditions by high speed
photography and pressure measurements was successfully captured
[77], as shown in Fig. 23, from deflagration to detonation. Also
shown are selected images at specific instances over the pressure

Ptrace, which clearly demonstrate the three distinguishing stages of
the combustion process: deflagration, detonation, and the resulting
pressure oscillations.

P4.2.1. Deflagration propagation

PThe first stage in the combustion process is deflagration. The
combustion event is initiated by a random pre-ignition particle that
first appears in the center in this case and ignites the mixture. A def-
lagration is initiated and the resulting blue flame propagates out-
ward at a subsonic flame speed. The chemical heat release from the
deflagration leads to thermal expansion of the burned zone, which
compresses the surrounding unburned mixture to high pressure and
high temperature.

P4.2.2. Detonation in unburned mixture

PThe second stage is detonation. Three distinct blue flames are ini-
tiated near the wall with two clearly identified merging boundaries
near the cylinder wall. Since the mixture in the center of the cylinder
has already been burned, the newly-initiated flames propagate
in the surrounding unburned mixture along the periphery of the
cylinder.

PA rapidly propagating wave travels from this region to the bot-
tom-right corner. The passage occurs in a short time with a propaga-
tion speed of 3080 m/s in the unburned mixture near the wall. This
supersonic wave propagates with a Mach number of 5.5. Indeed, the
Chapman-Jouguet theory yields a C-J detonation velocity (DCJ) of
2325 m/s. This clearly indicates that the bright blue flame is a strong
detonation wave, which rapidly sweeps past the pressure trans-
ducer, leading to a rapid pressure rise of 8.0 MPa in a short time
period of 0.04 ms, as is evident from the pressure “discontinuity” in
Fig. 23.

P4.2.3. Pressure oscillation in combustion chamber

PThe third stage is pressure oscillation. After the initiation of the
detonation the propagating fronts collide at the bottom of the cylin-
der, forming an incandescent zone. The merged waves are then
reflected from the bottom of the wall and bounce back towards
the top. Since all the reactants in the combustion chamber have
been consumed at this stage, the velocity of the resulting wave is
1155 m/s, which matches the sound speed of the burned gas.
The frequency of the pressure oscillation is 11 kHz, as shown in

PThe above high-speed combustion imaging from the above
RCM experiment demonstrates that the mechanism of super-
knock consists of hotspot-induced deflagration-to-detonation
transition followed by high-pressure oscillation. A deflagration
starts the combustion and leads to detonation, which is similar

Pto the pre-ignition observed in gasoline engines. However, it is

PThe above mechanism obtained in the RCM can also be used to
explain the phenomena of super-knock in boosted gasoline engines,
as shown in Fig. 24. First, pre-ignition occurs before TDC due to a
local hot-spot (oil, deposit, oil-gasoline, etc.) in the combustion
chamber during the compression stroke. A pre-ignition-triggered
flame propagates from the hot-spot to the rest of the mixture. Then,
the spark ignition occurs, and the 2nd flame front may propagate if
the spark ignition is in an unburned zone. The rapid expansion of the
burned gas rapidly compresses the unburned mixture to higher tem-
perature and pressure (about 1000 K, 10 MPa). Finally, a second hot-
spot (or multiple hot-spots) in the end gas induces the detonation of
the un-burned mixture at high temperature and high pressure, as
indicated in Fig. 24.

PAs the timing of the “hot spot” combustion in the unburned mix-
ture is crucial to detonation, this mechanism also helps to explain
why an earlier pre-ignition does not always lead to a higher knock
intensity. If the “hot spot” appears too early, the in-cylinder pressure
and temperature are relatively low. It may turn out to be a deflagra-
tion, similar to the combustion processes in the 1st stage. If the “hot
spot” appears too late, the majority of the mixture has already been
consumed by the deflagration, and pressure tends to decrease with
the downward movement of the piston. As a result, the pressure rise
and pressure oscillation will be smaller. If the “hot spot” starts near
TDC, it is likely to trigger detonation under high pressure and high
temperature conditions.

4.3. Effect of thermodynamic conditions on the combustion mode

P4.3.1. Pressure and temperature

PSince super-knock typically occurs near TDC at high loads, the
pressure and temperature have significant impact on super-knock or
the end-gas combustion mode. A systematically investigated effect
of pressure and temperature on auto-ignition behavior in a RCM
was conducted using a stoichiometric isooctane/O2/N2 mixture [78],
as shown in Fig. 25(a). The magnitude of the pressure oscillation
increases with increasing initial pressure.

PTo explore the sole effect of the temperature on combustion
mode, Fig. 25(b) gives pressure traces at different compression ratios
with the same pressure at the end of compression. The auto-ignition
timing advances as the compression ratio increases. This is attrib-
uted to the reduction of the end-gas ignition delay due to the

Ptemperature increase. It is interesting to note that the end-gas com-
bustion mode for the low temperature case is detonation; as
the temperature increases, the mode changes to sequential auto-
ignition. This indicates that temperature has less impact on detona-
tion formation than pressure does. This phenomenon is related to
the mixture density. Since detonation needs high heat release to ini-
tiate, a mixture with higher density is more prone to detonation due
to the higher energy.

PThe above data can be plotted in Gu and Bradley's detonation
peninsula [98], as shown in Fig. 26 using Kalghatgi and Bradley's
method [249]. The parameters of e and ξ at the time of knock onset
for the above test cases are calculated by the following equations:
ɛ 1⁄4 r0=a
te

ð8Þ

ξ 1⁄4 a

@ti

ð9Þ

Pte and ti are calculated using Chemkin software and the Wiscon-
sin PRF mechanism [250], r0 and @T/@r are assumed to be 5 mm and
¡2 K/mm, which are the same as those adopted by Kalghatgi and
Bradley [4]. It is obvious that the case of p0 = 0.53 bar (normal flame
propagation) is located in the deflagration area, and the case of
p0 = 1.19 bar (detonation) is located in the detonation area, while the
case of p0 = 0.66 bar (sequential auto-ignition) is located very close
to the boundary. It also shows that the propagation of detonation
outside the hot spot is entirely possible under low e conditions rele-
vant to a boosted gasoline engine.

P4.3.2. Energy density

PSince r/p/T, and the mixture density can thus be used to repre-
sent the coupling effect of pressure and temperature. Fig. 27 shows
the relationship between mixture density and combustion modes.
Here Eend is the energy density at the end of the compression. It
should be noted that combustion mode is closely related to the mix-
ture energy density. Detonation tends to occur at higher mixture
energy density instead of temperature. The boundary between the
auto-ignition and non-auto-ignition modes is also obvious according
the engine density. This is consistent with the results of SI combus-
tion engine tests, in which knock is unlikely to occur at low load
with low intake pressure, i.e., low energy density.

PIn SI engines under stoichiometric conditions, as the intake pres-
sure increases the mixture energy density also increases, which
increases the probability of knock, and ultimately leads to super-
knock [153,192]. This shows that, as the energy density increases,
the combustion mode in the end gas gradually transitions from
non-auto-ignition, sequential auto-ignition to detonation.

P4.3.3. Interaction of pressure - temperature - energy density

PPressure, temperature and energy density are related parameters.
To obtain the correlation, a significantly advanced spark timing to
simulate pre-ignition from 8 to ¡50 °CA ATDC was conducted [251]
at different boost pressures, as shown in Fig. 28. The results show
that early spark ignition triggered flame propagation, which could
lead to super-knock when the mixture state was above a critical con-
dition. At high boost pressure, advancing the spark timing caused
transitions from normal combustion to conventional knock, then to
super-knock and then back to conventional knock and to normal
combustion. The transition between knocking conditions was
well correlated with the thermodynamic state at the start of the in-
cylinder pressure oscillations. At the same intake temperature and
naturally aspirated conditions, only slight knock was observed by
advancing spark timing, which indicates that the thermodynamic

Pstate dominates the conditions of knocking or non-knocking
combustion.

PBased on the experimental results, a pressure-temperature-
energy density (P-T-E) diagram was developed to define super-
knock, knock and normal combustion criteria [251]. Fig. 29 presents
the knocking intensity results from the engine study as a function of
the characteristic pressure and temperature. The super-knocking
conditions are associated with high pressures and temperatures;
however, as noted above, these values do not uniquely identify
super-knocking conditions.

PIgnition delay time was identified as a criterion to distinguish
non-knocking conditions from knocking and super-knocking condi-
tions. Generally, an ignition delay time higher than 1.1 ms (corre-
sponding to 9.9 °CA at 1500 rpm) correlated well with non-knocking
results and ignition delay times lower than 1.1 ms correlated well
with knocking and super-knocking conditions.

PThe energy density of the unburned end-gas mixture at the onset
of knock was identified as a criterion for super-knock. For gasoline
fuel in the test engine, when the energy density of the unburned
end-gas mixture exceeded 30 MJ/m3, super-knock was always
observed. For lower energy densities, knock or non-knock was
observed.

4.4. Discussion of engine knock with NTC

P4.4.1. Phenomena of near-wall auto-ignition

PSince higher temperatures occur ahead of the flame front, it is
more likely for end-gas auto-ignition to occur near the flame front.
However, many studies have shown that auto-ignition usually
occurs in the end gas near the wall [1,80(cid:1)82,252,253]. Some
researchers propose that engine knock may be related to the nega-
tive temperature coefficient (NTC). Griffiths et al. [253] investigated
n-pentane homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) in a
RCM to identify the behavior of end-gas auto-ignition in SI engines.
Because of the local pressure rise caused by rapid heat release due to
hot stages of ignition, the authors inferred that the knock observed
in a RCM originates from the localized development of the hot stages
of ignition. Its origin from near the combustion chamber walls may
due to NTC behavior, as shown in Fig. 30(a), and an inhomogeneous
temperature field, as shown in Fig. 30(b). The authors also pointed
out that the rapidity and severity of the onset of high temperature
ignition is probably associated with the transition in these non-
homogeneous regions to vigorous chain branching through O atom
generation.

PIn contrast to this point, P€oschl et al. [80] investigated the influ-
ence of temperature inhomogeneities on the reaction kinetics of
knocking combustion using a primary reference fuel (PRF) which
exhibited strong NTC. The research octane number (RON) of the fuel
used was 69. The observed results showed that NTC does not play
any role in the evolution of knock. The authors concluded that the
initiation of a detonative combustion includes three stages: (1)
Sequential auto-ignition due to low temperature kinetics, which
leads to a fast-propagating reaction front along the temperature gra-
dient, as shown in Fig. 31. The cool flame travels with speeds of
50(cid:1)200 m/s. (2) Subsequently, a second reaction front due to main
heat release follows, with average speeds up to 500 m/s. (3) Shock
waves are generated by the fast-propagating reaction front. If the
shock wave is strong and the gas mixture is reactive enough, the
pressure wave couples with heat release. This detonation exhibits an
intensely illuminating flame that travels at speeds up to 1400 m/s.

PNear-wall auto-ignition was also observed using fuel which
exhibited non-NTC and weak NTC. Wang and co-authors [77,78,247]
investigated end-gas auto-ignition using a pure isooctane fuel. The
authors found that near-wall auto-ignition is the reproducible mode
observed in a closed cylinder under high temperature and high pres-
sure conditions. The detailed flame structures are slightly different
because the deflagrative flame front after spark ignition is wrinkled

Pdue to obstruction by the spark electrode. Fig. 32 shows selected
images after the end-gas auto-ignition of continuous five tests under
the same initial conditions [78]. The images exhibit very similar
combustion processes from deflagration to detonation and the same
transition mode from the near-wall auto-ignition (NWAI) to detona-
tion. NWAI is related to pressure wave reflection and chemical reac-
tion. It was found that weak pressure oscillations with amplitudes of
several bar were detected before detonation initiation due to the
fast propagating deflagration wave in the center, as shown in Fig. 22.
The first observed auto-ignition occurs near the wall and this could
be explained as follows: (1) a pressure wave/shock wave reflects
with double its amplitude at the wall, which compresses the near-
wall unburned gas to higher temperature and shortens the ignition
delay. (2) Turbulence-chemistry interaction shortens the ignition
delay due to relatively strong eddy dissipation near the wall at TDC
in the RCM. Local explosion is likely to occur in the corner vortices
near the wall.

P4.4.2. Effect of shock compression on ignition delay

PSince shock waves and temperature inhomogeneities always
occur in the engine knocking combustion process, the effect of both
shock waves and NTC on the ignition delay should be considered to
[254] calculated
understand near-wall auto-ignition. Qi et al.

Pignition delay variation in RCM tests [78] based on their experimen-
tal pressure traces. Their chemical-kinetics-calculated results show
that auto-ignition near the wall is unlikely to be affected by NTC.
The ignition delay traces of isooctane/air calculated according to
their experimental pressure traces almost do not pass through the
NTC region (Fig. 33), especially for low temperature at the end of
compression (Tend) cases.

PA recent RCM study revealed that the reason why super-
knock is usually initiated near the wall is due to shock wave
reflection near the cylinder wall [247]. The mechanism of the
near wall detonation initiation can be described as shock wave
reflection induced detonation (SWRID). SWRID has the following
features: (1) the end gas was compressed due to the heat release
of spark-triggered turbulent flame propagation (Fig. 34(a)); (2) a
relatively strong local end gas auto-ignites (local explosion),
which causes a sudden local pressure rise and generates an inci-
dent shock wave (Fig. 34(b)). The incident shock wave propa-
gates into the unburned mixture; (3) the incident shock wave
propagates in the mixture and interacts with the curved wall.
When the shock wave travels in the first half of the cylinder, the
area of the shock wave increases, as shown in Fig. 34(b). (4)
when the incident shock wave propagates in the second half of

the reflection of

Pthe cylinder, the area of the shock wave decreases.
In these
cases, a reflected shock wave is generated near the wall. As the
shock wave moves along the circular sidewall, the incident angle
changes continuously. Therefore,
the shock
wave evolves from Mach reflection to reverse Mach reflection,
and then to transitional regular reflection, and eventually to reg-
ular reflection [255,256], during which a Mach stem is generated.
The Mach stem further elevates the pressure and temperature of
the unburned mixture, and initiates detonation (Fig. 34(c)) [247].
The detonation wave then propagates
in the surrounding
unburned mixture (Fig. 34(d)), causing an extremely high pres-
sure rise in the cylinder.

PThe auto-ignition-initiated shock wave elevates the unburned
mixture's pressure and temperature. However, the ignition delay of
the mixture after the incident shock wave compression is still long,
even under higher pressure and temperature conditions. Only after
the Mach stem develops will the mixture pressure and temperature
be further elevated, and then detonation initiation occurs. The heat
release of the mixture couples with the shock wave reflection near
the wall, resulting in detonation, which propagates at a speed faster
than the C-J detonation velocity. Based on high-speed images, the
detonation is typically initiated near the cylinder wall [77,78,247].

Pprinciple for avoiding engine knock is that the time of flame propa-
gation to the end gas (t1) is less than the time of the end-gas auto-
ignition (t2). Possible control strategies present in SI engines are
summarized next.

P5.1.1. Retarding spark timing, improving octane number and enriching
mixture

PRetarding spark timing [257(cid:1)259], improving octane number
[258,260(cid:1)262] and enriching the mixture [258,263] are commonly
applied approaches for knock suppression in production engines
without component modifications. Retarding spark timing is the
most effective method to simultaneously reduce the end-gas tem-
perature and pressure. Lower end-gas temperature and pressure
prolong the ignition delay (t2). However, late spark timing usually
leads to an un-optimized combustion phase with lower thermal
efficiency. It also may deteriorate engine performance due to the
decrease in mean combustion chamber temperature and pressure
[264(cid:1)266]. Increasing the fuel octane number can be achieved by
introducing antiknock additives to the fuel, like ethers, etc. In addi-
tion, adding alcohols or even water into the combustion chamber
could also increase the time for the end-gas auto-ignition (t2) and

P120,121,183,258,286(cid:1)293]. Fuel directly injected in the cylinder can
lower the combustion temperatures due to the cooling associated
with fuel vaporization. Therefore, the cooling can lower knock sensi-
tivity and the compression ratio can be increased [288(cid:1)293].

PA two-stage injection concept was proposed by Kuwahara et al.
[289] and Yang et al. [294] for knock suppression and low speed tor-
que improvement in DISI engines, but the proposed rich mixtures
(A/F ratio = 12»12.5) would deteriorate fuel economy and exhaust
emissions, which limited the application of this method. Use of strat-
ified stoichiometric mixture has been demonstrated. Using a two-
stage injection strategy in gasoline direct injection engine, Stratified
Stoichiometric Mixture (SSM) could suppress knocking effectively
compared with a Homogeneous Stoichiometric Mixture (HSM) case,
as shown by the smooth pressure trace and lack of pressure oscilla-
tions in Fig. 36 [111]. Investigation of a two-stage strategy indicated
that locally slightly rich mixtures due to a late injection helps to sup-
press auto-ignition by providing a local cooling effect and by
enhancing the local flame propagation speed [55]. The assessment
concludes that two-stage injection is an effective method for sup-
pressing knock under high load operating conditions. However, the
injection strategies and combustion systems need to be carefully
designed and optimized to avoid soot emissions.

P5.1.4. Dual-fuel spark ignition with DI and PFI

PDual-fuel spark ignition (DFSI) combustion is more flexible to
suppress knock and improve efficiency [123,128,258,295(cid:1)302],
especially using gasoline and alcohols in SI engines. The potentials of
ethanol direct-injection (DI) and dual-injection (PFI and DI) engines,
to cool the charge and suppress knock were examined in Ref. [303].

Pthen suppress knock [267,268].
Injecting excessive fuel could
increase the effect of charge cooling and decrease the temperature
of the mixture, which could prolong the time to end-gas auto-igni-
tion and finally suppress knock. However, under the condition of
fuel enrichment, HC and CO emissions increase, and since the TWC
can only work under stoichiometric conditions, this causes problems
of fuel economy and emissions.

P5.1.2. Exhaust gas recirculation

PExhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is regarded as an effective
method [115,118,124,129,258,263,269(cid:1)277] for suppressing knock
in advanced SI engines due to the resulting increased t2. Further-
more, cooled EGR has more potential in knock mitigation without a
loss of output power [54,55,118,278,279]. Grandin et al. [118] dem-
onstrated that by increasing the EGR ratio from 7% to 13%, the maxi-
mum BMEP increases with advanced spark timing. But, with further
advanced spark timing, BMEP does not increase, since it is limited by
knocking combustion. Increasing the EGR ratio reduces this limita-
tion. Because an increase of cooled EGR lowers the gas temperature,
and more fuel is consumed before reaching the knock temperature
limit, therefore, it can further widen the ignition advance angle.

PTo quantify the effect of EGR on knock intensity, Alger et al. [129]
conducted experiments on a 2.4 L boosted, MPI gasoline engine,
equipped with a low-pressure loop (LPL) cooled EGR system. The
results indicate that the improvement in effective AKI (anti-knock
index) of the fuel from using EGR is about 0.5 RON per % of EGR for
commercial grade gasoline fuels. Higher levels of EGR (EGR > 15%)
have been shown to have a significant effect on engine efficiency
leading to improved combustion phasing
by reducing knock,
[118,280(cid:1)282] and the ability to operate at higher loads at com-
pression ratios above 12 [283,284] (Fig. 35).

PCombining the effects of boosting, increased compression ratio
and cooled EGR [269] to further improve fuel economy, has also
been investigated. Compared with CR 9.3 and no EGR, CR 10.9 and
18(cid:1)25% cooled EGR could improve fuel economy by 6(cid:1)9%. Among
the contributing effects, the primary one is the theoretical thermal
efficiency improvement caused by the increased ratio of specific
heats and increased geometric CR, while the second one is the
reduction in heat transfer loss due to lower combustion tempera-
tures with EGR. On the contrary, high temperature internal EGR has
a disadvantageous effect on knock suppression because of its heat-
ing effect, which should be avoided for gasoline engines. Mazda
[285] used a 4-2-1 exhaust manifold timing sequence to reduce
internal EGR and to decrease the temperature at TDC for suppress-
ing knock.

P5.1.3. Stratified mixtures

PUse of stratified mixture is a flexible approach to suppress knock
and is usually achieved using direct injection [109,111,112,114,

Ppromising methods of using alternative fuels in gasoline engines
with significant improvements in thermal efficiency due to knock
suppression. Gasoline-alcohols DFSI exhibited higher anti-knock
performance than alcohols-gasoline DFSI. However, alcohols-gaso-
line DFSI is more practical for the automotive industry due to fewer
engine modification requirements.

P5.1.5. Other methods

P5.1.5.1. Turbulence [205,258,310,311].
PIncreasing turbulence inten-
sity usually suppresses engine knock. Once combustion has started,
increased turbulence leads to fast combustion and decreases the ten-
dency to knock [265,266,312]. However, at the start of combustion,
increased turbulence also increases heat transfer from the spark
electrode. To solve this problem, modern engines adopt high energy
ignition (more than 100 mJ) to support strong turbulence. For exam-
ple, through optimizing the geometry of the intake port as shown in
Fig. 38, the tumble ratio of a dedicated engine for the Toyota Prius
hybrid increased from 0.8 in the previous 2ZR-FXE model to 2.8 in
the ESTEC 2ZR-FXE. Introduction of high tumble-induced-high-tur-
bulence is accompanied by low tendency to knock.

PCooling of

the combustion
chamber walls is also an effective approach to reduce end-gas
temperatures. An effective method to suppress knock is chang-
ing the coolant flow patterns to improve the distribution of
wall temperatures [266]. However, increased heat transfer low-
ers the thermal efficiency. To suppress knock without a consid-
erable loss of thermal efficiency, only the upper portion of the
exhaust side bore should be cooled, and foam rubber can be
utilized to provide heat insulation to maintain the temperature
of the center and lower portions of the bore, as shown in
Fig. 38 [155].

PCooling the intake charge is also useful for knock suppression.
The initial condition of the end gas during a cycle is the intake
air temperature. As expected by the Livengood-Wu correlation
[92], the temperature history of the end-gas mixture plays an
important role in engine knock. In addition, cooling the exhaust
manifold is also important. A water-cooled exhaust manifold
(WCEM) [316] with high cooling capacity was adopted to reduce
the temperature of the exhaust valve surface and the EGR so as
to suppress knock.

Fig. 36. Experimental results of Stratified Stoichiometric Mixture (SSM) and Homoge-
neous Stoichiometric Mixture (HSM) for knock suppression (adapted from [111]).

PDual-injection using PFI-gasoline with DI-E85 was developed on
‘Ecoboost’ gasoline turbo-charged engines [156,304]. The engine
efficiency was improved by suppressing knock at low-speed, high-
load conditions. Higher volumetric efficiency by using ethanol and
gasoline dual-injection was observed [305,306]. However, CO and
HC emissions increased when the amount of ethanol was higher
than 36% in the total fuel energy. Compared to the gasoline DI
engine, the compression ratio of the dual-fuel engine was increased
from 9.5 to 13.3 and it achieved significantly improved engine
efficiency [307].

PAlcohols-gasoline and gasoline-alcohols dual-fuel spark ignition
(DFSI) combustion have been compared for knock suppression and
higher engine efficiency using a high CR gasoline engine
[143,308,309]. Alcohols-gasoline DFSI is organized using a PFI of
high latent heat of vaporization, high octane number, and highly
oxygenated fuel to suppress knock and a DI of high energy density
fuel to extend engine load. Gasoline-alcohols DFSI was organized by
gasoline PFI and alcohol DI, as shown in Fig. 37. It was found that
both alcohols-gasoline DFSI and gasoline-alcohols DFSI are

effective

is a practical way to
change effective compression ratio at relatively low cost for
the different engine operating regions. Late intake valve closure
(LIVC) is commonly used at high load to achieve a lower effective
compression ratio to avoid knock. Nissan developed a 1.2 L
engine with such an Atkinson cycle, which uses LIVC to suppress
knock.

but the complex structure makes the cost increase significantly

P[322]. However, FEV [323] has developed a VCR engine to suppress
knock and improve fuel economy effectively.

5.2. Control strategy for super-knock

PAs reviewed in this article, there are two ways to avoid super-
knock. One is to eliminate pre-ignition. The other is to decouple the
shock wave and the heat release.
PTo suppress pre-ignition,

the following factors should be

established.

P1) Oil intrusion: Oil intrusion into the combustion chamber can be
reduced by using a larger chamfer piston edge [153], increased
oil ring tension [224] or optimized ring orientation [324]. Use of
a low volatility oil [153] and improved oil ventilation [197,324]
are also helpful.

P2) Oil/fuel mixing: Avoiding oil/fuel mixing in a gasoline direct
injection engine can be achieved by adjusting the spray direc-
tion to reduce liner wall wetting, by employing a split injection
strategy [153,204,325], or by adopting high tumble to enhance
air motion [151] to reduce spray penetration.

P3) Oil properties: Optimized oil formulations, including use of low
calcium [152,324,326], Na [326], sulphated ash [227], and high
ZnDTP [152] and MoDTC [147] oils.

P4) Fuel properties: Optimized fuel formulation, including low aro-
matics [201,232], high ethanol addition [201], and low volatility
[151,193,202].

P5) Solid particles: Reduced flammable particles floating in the com-
bustion chamber, including deposits [220,222], soot [204], and
metal dusts [148] Fe, Cu, etc.

P6) Combustion system: Optimized engine combustion systems to
reduce end-of-compression temperatures by enriching the mix-
ture or promoting gasoline evaporation via direct injection, or
scavenging of the hot residual gas [214,327]

PTo suppress super-knock with a pre-ignition, the following fac-

tors should be established:

P1) Adopting high octane fuels with higher laminar flame speeds, for

example, gasoline/alcohol blends [3].

P2) Optimized fuel formulations, including fuels with low aromatic

content [149,201,202].

P3) Decrease reactivity of the unburned mixture, by introducing
cooler EGR [213], or ignition inhibitors as fuel additives, or even
spraying water.

P4) Increase mixture gradients by dual fuel direct injection to

achieve fuel stratification [156].

PSome practical solutions have been applied in gasoline engine

production to control super-knock, and are summarized as follows:

P5.2.1. Cooled EGR

PBesides suppression of conventional knock, engine tests indicate
that light-to-moderate levels of EGR also dramatically suppresses
super-knock.

PEGR decreases the thermal load on the combustion chamber to
suppress pre-ignition and then to suppress super-knock. Even add-
ing small amounts of cooled EGR (6% or 10%) allows the reduction of
super-knock frequency and intensity obviously, while also increas-
ing BMEP, as shown in Fig. 39. Furthermore, under 10% EGR, it is pos-
sible to increase BMEP by 17% and thermal efficiency by 2% while
decreasing super-knock frequency by 80%, when compared to the
baseline without EGR [213].

Fig. 39. LSPI (super-knock) frequency increase for non-EGR operation immediately
following EGR test runs (adapted from [213]).

P5.2.2. Scavenging

PScavenging is a practical method for cooling combustion chamber
walls. For boosted GDI engines, the scavenging process can be con-
trolled using VVT technology.

PThe effectiveness of scavenging at high load for a turbocharged
GDI engine under the conditions of stoichiometric [214] and lean
[328] mixture combustion has been demonstrated using appropriate
control of VVT parameters. It was also found that TGDI engines could
be operated super-knock free, even when PI events were not elimi-
nated completely. The pre-ignition cycles with scavenging were visu-
alized using an endoscope [221]. It was found that scavenging has a
positive effect to suppress pre-ignition. If some of the particles gener-
ated during the first pre-ignition cycle are not scavenged and remain
inside the cylinder, the residual particles are heated during the sub-
sequent combustion cycle and can induce the pre-ignition again.

P5.2.3. Injection strategy

PThe effects of injection strategies on super-knock have been com-
paratively investigated [116,204], as shown in Fig. 40. It was found
that two-stage injections during the intake stroke (TSII, case 4) could
eliminate super-knock due to a reduction of oil dilution via fuel
In addition, fuel efficiency,
impingement on the cylinder liner.
exhaust temperature and emissions could be optimized by control-
ling the two injection timings, start of first injection (SOI1) and end
of second injection (EOI2). The optimized injection strategy for a
typical turbocharged gasoline direct injection engine is SOI1 in the
middle of the intake stroke, EOI2 at the end of the intake stroke. If
EOI2 occurs in the late compression stroke to form a stratified charge
(Case 6), it decreased the super-knock frequency, but both fuel con-
sumption and exhaust temperature increased. Obviously, this injec-
tion strategy is not suitable for long-term operation because of
turbocharger durability considerations.

PMixture enrichment, stratification and scavenging strategies for
super-knock suppression were also compared [204,328]. Mixture
increased fuel consumption. Mixture stratification
enrichment
reduced super-knock frequency, but resulted in a remarkable
increase of exhaust temperature. Scavenging by retarding the
exhaust valve closing timing could suppress super-knock, but
increase fuel consumption and CO emissions. TSII could eliminate
super-knock while maintaining acceptable fuel consumption, emis-
sions and exhaust temperatures. Thus, TSII has become a dominant
injection strategy and has been widely applied in TC-GDI engine pro-
duction in recent years [116,325]. More references about injection

P5.2.4. Integration of high tumble-high EGR-Atkinson/Miller cycle

PTo control both conventional knock and super-knock, several
effective methods should be combined. Toyota recently developed a
dedicated hybrid engine, the ESTEC 2ZR-FXE, for the fourth genera-
tion Prius. It is the first gasoline engine reported to achieve a maxi-
mum thermal efficiency of 40% [155]. Knocking combustion is
successfully suppressed at full load with a geometrical compression
ratio of 13. The main methods for improving combustion are the use
of a high tumble ratio of 2.8, up to 25% EGR and a late IVC Atkinson
cycle. Similar integration of EGR, the Miller cycle and a high com-
pression ratio has been adopted to suppress pre-ignition and to
improve fuel economy while realizing high load [324,332]. Experi-
mental work was conducted in a four-cylinder turbocharged gaso-
line engine, with an additional supercharger to obtain higher boost
pressures. The combustion strategy of a Miller cycle and low pres-
sure EGR were studied and compared under a very high engine load
condition, which can be seen in Fig. 41. An IMEPg of 3.0 MPa was
achieved at 1500 rpm without pre-ignition using the Miller cycle
concept. This result shows the possibility of further downsized
engines in the near future.

6. Conclusions and future research directions

6.1. Conclusions

PIn summary, the knocking combustion research reviewed in this

paper has revealed the following:

P6.1.1. Conventional knock

PKnocking combustion in internal combustion engines is a phe-
nomenon of pressure oscillations coupled with chemical kinetics,
which originates from auto-ignition. High-speed optical diagnostics
and advanced numerical simulations have been widely adopted to
detect end-gas auto-ignition, intermediate combustion species, and
pressure oscillations. It has been found that the in-cylinder local
pressure is extremely uneven during the engine knocking process.
Sequential auto-ignitions elevate the local pressure amplitude and
form pressure waves. The pressure waves propagate and reflect
from the chamber surfaces to generate pressure oscillations, which
also enhance heat transfer due to the increased convective heat
transfer associated with pressure oscillation-induced flows.

P6.1.2. Pre-ignition and super-knock

PThe occurrence of sporadic super-knock is a major obstacle in the
development of advanced gasoline engines. Although pre-ignition is
required for the occurrence of super-knock, pre-ignition does not
always lead to super-knock. Pre-ignition could lead to super-knock,
heavy knock, slight knock and non-knock. The knock intensity tends
to increase with a knock onset that occurs near TDC.

PA rapid compression machine is a suitable facility to investigate
pre-ignition and super-knock under engine-like conditions with
synchronous high-speed, high-resolution photography and pressure
acquisition. In RCM experiments, super-knock was confirmed to be
the result of detonation. The data reveal that the mechanism of pre-
ignition to super-knock is due to a hotspot-induced deflagration
transitioning to hotspot-induced detonation, followed by high-pres-
sure oscillation.

P6.1.3. Knocking control strategies

PSI engine fuel economy depends highly on mitigating knocking,
and intensive experimental achievements have been used to control
knock. Commonly used strategies include retarding spark timing,
enriching the mixture, use of a high octane fuel, cooled EGR, cooled
intake air, and enhancing turbulence in the combustion chamber.
VVT, VGT and VCR have been applied in advanced gasoline engines
with closed-loop control strategies. Thermal efficiency was further
improved by more than 10% compared to current market engines
(i.e., BTE from 35% to 40%). For gasoline direct injection engines, split
injection is a promising knock suppression strategy to organize an
optimal distribution of mixture concentration. A dual fuel spark igni-
tion (DFSI) mode is useful for a moderate fuel stratification distribu-
tion. Combining PFI and GDI, the maximum achievable load exceeds
27 bar BMEP in production engines.

PEliminating pre-ignition is an effective approach to suppress
super-knock. The main origins of pre-ignition include oil droplets
and deposit particles. The composition and physicochemical proper-
ties of the fuel and oil seriously affect the frequency of occurrence of
super-knock. It was found that oil additives have important effects
on pre-ignition. CaSulfonate and NaSulfonate tend to promote pre-
ignition, while the addition of ZnDDP and MoDTC tends to retard
pre-ignition. Oil-induced pre-ignition and super-knock have a rela-
tively greater probability to occur when the engine is highly
boosted.

P6.1.4. Combustion wave modes

POptical diagnostics have identified three end-gas combustion
modes as no-autoignition, sequential autoignition, and detonation
which appear under different initial conditions. The end-gas com-
bustion mode is closely related to the mixture energy density in
spite of temperature. As the mixture energy density increases, the
end-gas combustion mode gradually transitions from no-autoigni-
tion to sequential autoignition, and then to detonation.

PIn a high temperature and high pressure closed combustion
chamber, the local mixture auto-ignition generates a shock wave.
Detonation initiations are usually associated with the shock wave.
Shock wave reflection-induced detonation (SWRID) is the most fre-
quently observed mode and the detonation is initiated near the wall
because a local auto-ignition-generated shock wave is reflected by a
concave cylinder wall. Before detonation is initiated the speed of the
combustion wave front is less than that of a C-J detonation. Once the
detonation is initiated, the speed of the combustion wave propagat-
ing in the unburned mixture is close to or exceeds the C-J detonation
speed.

6.2. Future research directions

POver the past decade, great progress has been made in under-
standing knocking combustion and its characteristics. From the pre-
sented literature here it is inferred that there is scope for further
research on knocking combustion, as listed below.

P6.2.1. Fundamental theory relating to knocking combustion

POptical diagnostics of knocking combustion: There are many
including temperature stratification, random
influencing factors,
turbulence, shock wave compression and chemical reactivity, that
serve to induce knocking combustion. However, a quantitative crite-
rion for predicting knocking combustion is still unavailable. Thus,
future directions for studying detonation initiation include: Utilizing
modern optical diagnostics of PLIF and PIV spectra to detect interme-
diate species and combustion field details (temperature, pressure,
and velocity distribution) during knocking combustion, identifying
combustion wave modes, understanding shock wave propagation,
reflection and intersection, and revealing the mechanism of def-
lagration-to-detonation transition under engine conditions.

PSingle droplet and particle ignition in an ignitable mixture
under high pressures: To identify pre-ignition sources and to deter-
mine super-knock conditions, a RCM with optical accessibility is a
suitable facility to investigate the phenomena under internal com-
bustion engine conditions. It can not only be used to study auto-igni-
tion combustion wave modes, but also to reveal the auto-ignition
propensity of a single oil droplet or a particle in a stoichiometric gas-
oline-like fuel mixture. The effect of oil, additives, and fuel proper-
ties can be flexibly controlled to isolate the parameters that
dominate under different thermodynamic conditions,
including
pressure, temperature and concentrations.

PTurbulence-shock-reaction interaction theory: Detonations
represent a highly nonlinear problem that couples turbulence, shock
waves and chemical kinetics, and which involves strong discontinu-
ities with multiple time and space scales. Its numerical simulation
requires not only a high-resolution numerical scheme, but also
requires treatment of numerical stiffness from multi-reaction time
scales. Furthermore, the huge computational resources that are
needed due to the high-resolution and large hydrocarbon fuel chem-
istry mechanism are unacceptable. Hence, it is essential to develop
numerical methods with the ability to handle discontinuities and
reaction stiffness, and auto-adaptive reaction mechanism reduction
techniques and refined meshes for direct numerical simulation are
needed.

P6.2.2. Detonation suppression and utilization

PSuper-knock is at present the major challenge for improving the
power density in IC engines, not only for SI combustion, but also for
HCCI combustion and dual fuel combustion if the premixed mixture
concentration is high enough. A premixed charge is actually to some
degree inhomogeneous in an engine combustion chamber, and this
is likely to influence a developing detonation. There are two
approaches to suppress super-knock. One is to eliminate pre-igni-
tion sources, and the other is to avoid super-knock (detonation initi-
ation). When a BMEP of up to 25 bar is desired in production engine,
eliminating random pre-ignition becomes more-and-more of a chal-
lenge, and avoiding destructive detonation will be paid more atten-
tion. This may proceed by eliminating the transmission routes of
shock waves, or by damping their amplitudes so as to suppress
super-knock even with a pre-ignition (e.g., organizing a strong gradi-
ent of temperature and concentration, or introducing reaction inhib-
itors to prevent a shock wave coupled with heat
release).
Suppressing detonation prevents damage to the internal combustion
engine, and the methods to be explored could also benefit industrial
safety (e.g., preventing mine gas explosion and dust explosion acci-
dents).

PSince most detonations are initiated near the walls due to SWRID,
a promising way to avoid super-knock is to remove radical species in
the end gas near the walls. For instance, organizing pure air or EGR
to be located at the periphery of the combustion chamber will help
to avoid shock wave coupling with chemical kinetics near the wall.
Or,
combustion,
described as 1st stage combustion near walls, from burned gases
without radicals such that the 2nd stage combustion occurs at the
cylinder center.

temporally-spatially

distributed

organizing

PAlmost all existing knocking combustion studies focus on auto-
ignition/detonation suppression, and the possibility of utilizing
auto-ignition/detonation could be a future research direction. For
instance, controllable HCCI is an example for utilizing lean mixture
auto-ignition in internal combustion engines. Controlled detonation
could be applied as for PDE/RDE (Pulse detonation engine or Rotary
detonation engines) in the aerospace field. Some key scientific prob-
lems remain to be investigated,
including detonation initiation.
These problems include hotspot ignition, deflagration, sequential
and combustion mode

Ptransition in ignitable mixtures over wide temperature and pressure
ranges.

PIn order to suppress/utilize detonation, it is required to decouple/
couple shock waves and reaction fronts. This may be accomplished
by changing the amplitude and propagation direction of the shock
wave via mixture stratification and reactivity distributions, or wall
interactions. Such research will not only be helpful to improve the
performance of internal combustion engines, but also may benefit
the development of advanced aerospace engines.

P6.2.3. Engine knock control and super-knock solution

PSimulation works are effective to guide knock research and
engine development in order to achieve high efficiency and high
load operation. Utilizing a reduced surrogate fuel mechanism, a
practical flame model and an accurate heat transfer model in 3D-
CFD to capture auto-ignition ahead of the flame, will be helpful to
evaluate knock intensity and optimize the combustion system in a
spark-ignition engine.

PUsing direct injection of a second fuel, such as ethanol/methanol
or gasoline blends, is an effective means to avoid knock in spark-
ignited engines. Further study may focus on the dynamics of alcohol
vaporization effects on the charge temperature of the unburned
mixture at high loads above 25 bar BMEP.

PPre-ignition and super-knock will still be major obstacles for
engine development in the next decades. For pre-ignition and super-
knock suppression, two aspects should be paid close attention to:
One is the properties of the lubricant oil and fuel, including their
cleanliness, additives, laminar flame thickness, ignition delay, etc.
The other concerns the engine design and optimization, including
piston ring land structure, spray pattern, injection strategies, flow
motion, sealing system, and cooling system, etc. To develop an effec-
tive solution, more research is necessary to clarify the detailed
mechanisms of pre-ignition and super-knock, especially the role
that oil droplets, fuel and deposits play in this process. With the
understanding that future engine oil formulations will have to meet
performance and durability requirements, besides suppressing pre-
ignition, a critical balance must be maintained for a holistic solution.
The effect of fuel properties, including olefin, aromatic, ethanol, and
methanol content on pre-ignition and super-knock is also a produc-
tive future research direction.

PFinally, integration of cooled EGR, Atkinson/Miller cycles and
multi-stage boost is also a potential solution to achieve above 27 bar
BMEP.
