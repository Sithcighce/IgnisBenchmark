The importance of graphene and its derivatives for “clean energy” applications became apparent over
the last few years due to their exceptional characteristics, especially regarding electrical, thermal and
chemical properties. In this review article we examine the recent progress and some of the challenges
in the syntheses and modification of graphene-based materials, including energy storage applications as
electrodes in Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Various synthesis routes have been used for obtaining graphene us-
ing different kinds of carbon sources (graphite, non-graphitic carbon and carbon-containing materials).
The most popular processing methods include epitaxial growth, liquid phase chemical/electrochemical
exfoliation, mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition and laser-assisted synthesis. Taking the re-
duction approach, chemical, thermal, microwave and laser reduction methods have been applied to pre-
pare graphene from graphene oxide/graphite oxide. Recent research has shown that graphene derivatives
and hybrids/ nanocomposites using metal oxides/mixed metal oxides and metal sulfides/mixed metal sul-
phides can have a profound impact on the performance of energy storage devices. Closing the text, we
speculate on the future prospects for the application of graphene and its derivatives in energy storage
devices. We expect that this review article will help in generating new insights for further development
and practical applications of graphene-based materials.

1. Introduction

The intense use of fossil fuels, coupled with other human ac-
tivities, has generated environmental pollution, greenhouse effects
and global warming [1] . In the past few decades, several research
groups have been working to find solutions to minimize the en-
vironmental pollution and one of their main targets has been the
low carbon emission fossil fuels for vehicles [2–7] . Nowadays, the
motivation  has  shifted  from  low-carbon  emission  fuels  to  non-
fossil fuels and a lot of attention has been paid to energy conver-
sion and storage devices such as fuel cells, solar cells, supercapac-
itors and batteries [8–16] .

Batteries have attracted vigorous research because of their ex-
tensive use in portable electronic devices [17,18] . Among various
kinds of electrochemical batteries, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have
now  become  the  most  popular  rechargeable  type,  being  applied
in numerous electronic devices such as mobile phones, notebooks
and tablets, besides the ever increasing potential for use in elec-
tric vehicles [19–23] . The electrodes of LIBs are important parts in
the battery assembly being targeted for improvement, since high
energy density LIBs with extended cycle life and great rate perfor-
mance are expected to remain in great demand [24,25] .

Carbon-based  materials  are  progressively  playing  increasingly
critical  roles  for  energy  storage  in  LIBs  [24,25] .  Graphite-derived
materials, in particular, are appropriate for energy storage devices
and especially for LIBs, owing to their layered structure and the re-
versible reaction between these materials and the lithium–carbon
compounds used as electrolytes [26] . Graphite is extensively used
as the anode material in LIBs due to its unique electrochemical and
physical properties [27–31] . In spite of its widespread use, the low
theoretical capacity (372 mAh/g) [32–35] and poor rate capability
[36–38] of graphite still restricts LIB performance. Theoretical stud-
ies have shown that lowering the dimensionality of conventional
anode materials via nanotechnology can achieve higher capacity,
thus low dimensional carbon materials have been investigated as a
replacement for graphite in LIB anodes [39–41] .

Graphene, the carbon-based two dimensional (2D) material dis-
covered in 2004 has generated excitement among LIB researchers
because of its atomic thickness, unique electronic properties, high

mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity and large surface
area  [42–44] .  Graphene,  along  with  its  leading  derivatives,  has
promoted  rapid  developments  in  LIB  commercialization  [45–48] .
Graphene  oxide  (GO)  can  be  easily  synthesized  in  large  scale
via  the  chemical  oxidation  and  exfoliation  of  graphite.  GO  con-
tains  oxygen  functionalities  (epoxy,  hydroxyl,  carboxyl  and  car-
bonyl groups) on its surfaces and edges which help in the attach-
ment of metal oxide nanomaterials for energy-related applications.
In order to obtain the reduced GO (rGO), several techniques such
as chemical treatment, thermal annealing, microwave heating and
laser irradiation can be applied.

Many  effort s  have  been  made  to  develop  improved  electrode
materials to meet the increasing demand for LIBs with longer cy-
cle life and higher energy density [24,49–51] . Several published re-
search works indicate that graphene/GO with metal oxides as an-
odes provide good performance for LIBs [52–55] . The contact of GO
with nanoscale metals assist the redox processes and electrons can
spontaneously transfer from metal to GO, leading to the formation
of rGO and metal oxidation [56] . The graphene/GO provides sup-
port for metal oxides, preventing the agglomeration of nanoparti-
cles (NPs) and volume change during cycling [35,57] . A few review
articles focused on the electrochemical energy storage applications
of graphene materials have been published, discussing recent out-
comes and challenges in this field [58–60] .

In this article we have presented a broad overview of the syn-
thesis  of  graphene  (both  top-down  and  bottom-up  approaches),
GO/graphite  oxide  and  its  reduction  using  various  methods  for
novel applications in LIBs. This review article can be divided into
three parts: (i) synthesis of graphene, (ii) reduction of GO/graphite
oxide and (iii) applications of graphene/GO and derivatives in LIBs.
Synthesis of graphene has been described using mechanical exfoli-
ation, liquid phase chemical/electrochemical exfoliation, CVD, epi-
taxial growth and laser processing. Reduction of GO/graphite ox-
ide has been surveyed, including chemical, thermal, microwave and
laser methods. Finally, we have reviewed the recent progress in the
use of graphene and its derivatives in electrode (anode/cathode)
materials for LIBs. Fig. 1 presents a schematic illustration of the
possibilities for application of graphene/rGO and their derivatives
in LIBs.

2. Synthesis of graphene

The  main  paths  for  the  synthesis  of  graphene  can  be  classi-
fied  into  two  major  categories:  top-down  and  bottom-up  meth-
ods [61,62] . In the top-down methods, bulk size materials are con-
verted into their smallest compositional components [63] . Some of
the main top-down methods to produce graphene from graphitic
sources  are:  mechanical/chemical  exfoliation  [64–66] ,  laser  abla-
tion [67–69] , plasma etching [70–72] and unzipping of carbon nan-
otubes  (CNTs)  [73–75] .  In  the  bottom-up  methods,  the  synthe-
sis  of  graphene  is  accomplished  from  liquid  or  gaseous  carbon-
containing precursors [76] . Molecules/atoms are decomposed from
carbonaceous precursors and in-situ arranged to form the hexag-
onal  structure  of  graphene  layers.  CVD  [77–81] ,  pyrolysis  [82–
84]  and epitaxial  growth [85–87]  are some of  the main paths
in  this  approach  for  the  synthesis  of  graphene.  Fig.  2  shows  a
schematic  representation  for  the  synthesis  of  graphene  by  both
bottom-up and top-down routes. Laser synthesis can be performed
according  to  both  principles, depending on  the  particular  condi-
tions employed.

2.1. Top-down approaches: graphitic carbon sources

referred  to  as  the  “scotch  tape” method,  because  the  bonding
strength  of  graphene  layers  to  an  adhesive  tape  was  used  by
the  authors  to  overcome  the  weak  interlayer  bonding  forces  in
graphite. The monocrystalline few-layer graphene films were two-
dimensional and its electronic properties exhibit a strong ambipo-
lar electric field effect, with electrons and holes in concentrations
up to 10 13 /cm 2 . The detailed study showed that the unique elec-
tronic structure of single-layer graphene exhibits anomalous quan-
tum  Hall  effects,  confirming  the  Dirac-fermionic  behavior  of  the
charge carriers in graphene. It was soon recognized that few-layer
graphene  flakes  obtained  by  micromechanical  cleavage  could  be
further cleaved into successively thinner samples, up to monolayer
graphene.

Formation of graphene sheets with various thicknesses by me-
chanical exfoliation has been reported using natural graphite [90] ,
mono-crystal graphite [91] , and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite
(HOPG)  [92] .  Mechanical  exfoliation  needs  external  forces  up  to
300  nN/μm 2  for  the  separation  of  a  single  atomic  layer  from
graphite  [93,94] .  Mechanical  exfoliation  is  a  low  yield  technique
and it is not suitable for reproducible or large-scale generation of
graphene.

Chemical  or  mechanical  exfoliation/cutting/milling  of  graphite
into few-layers or sheets can be performed at room temperature or
at higher temperatures, being a typical top-down method [88] . In
mechanical milling/grinding, kinetic energy is transferred to bulk
materials and may reduce their size down to the nanoscale. It is
possibly the simplest example of top-down method for nanomate-
rials synthesis.

2.1.1. Mechanical exfoliation

Exfoliation  is  the  reverse  step  of  stacking  plane  layers  with
big interplane spacing and poor bonding in the direction orthog-
onal  to  the  planes.  Mechanical  exfoliation  is  the  earliest  docu-
mented technique, employed by Novoselov et al. in 2004, to ex-
tract few-layer graphene flakes from a high quality graphitic piece
[44,89] .  This  micromechanical  cleavage  procedure  is  frequently

2.1.2. Liquid phase chemical/ electrochemical exfoliation

Mechanical  exfoliation  of  graphite  may  provide  high  quality
graphene,  but  the  small  yield  and  lack  of  effective  control  over
the  number  of  layers  are  detrimental  to  many  of  the  intended
applications of graphene. Liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite is a
promising method to obtain high quality graphene directly from
graphite [95–99] . The interlayer spacing in graphite can be further
increased, therefore reducing the Van der Waals forces [100,101] .
The  spacing  can  be  increased  by  chemical  oxidation  or  the  in-
sertion/  intercalation  of  large  (when  compared  to  the  interlayer
distance)  size  molecules  or  metal  atoms  amongst  the  graphitic
layers  [102] .  There  are  several  parameters  involved  in  the  syn-
thesis  of  graphene  using  liquid  phase  exfoliation,  and  they  have
been  investigated  by  several  authors  [103–109] .  With  weakened
interlayer forces, sonication in various liquid chemicals has been

applied  to  exfoliate  graphite  into  monolayer  to  few-layers
graphene [102] . By changing sonication parameters such as time,
frequency and power, the number of graphene sheets and the size
of the graphene flakes can be modified [110–115] .

Over the past few years, a series of solvents has been used to
exfoliate graphite to graphene. In liquid-phase exfoliation, the se-
lection of the liquid solvent is a crucial step, since it affects the
yield  of  the  process  and  the  stability  of  the  resulting  graphene
suspension.  As  a  general  trend,  the  performance  of  solvents  for
graphite exfoliation is highly dependent on (1) the surface tension
of the solvent. Hernandez et al. [116] observed that solvents with
surface  tension  values  in  the  range  of  40–50  mJ/m 2  provide  for
better exfoliation. (2) The solvent should be able to overcome the
Van der Waals force from the interaction between graphene layers,
which are held within the π –π stacking distance of 3.35–3.4  ̊A. (3)
For an effective stabilization of the graphene dispersion in suspen-
sion, the solvent-nanosheet interactions should balance the inter-
sheet attractive forces [116] . (4) Water is considered an efficient ex-
foliation medium. Moreover, the addition of other chemical species
to the aqueous medium enhances the exfoliation of graphite by re-
ducing the surface energy of water [117] .

Organic  solvents  like  benzylamine  (BA),  benzyl  benzoate
(BNBZ), cyclohexanone (CYC), dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl
sulfoxide  (DMSO),  1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone  (DMEU),  N , N -
dimethylacetamide  (DMA),  γ -butyrolactone  (GBL),  n -methyl-2-
pyrrolidone (NMP), tetramethylurea (TMU) etc. have been used for
the exfoliation of graphite [118] . The effect of sonication energy on
the yield of graphene nanosheets obtained by liquid-phase exfoli-
ation of graphite has been studied by Durge et al. [119] . In DMF
solution,  low  power  bath  sonication  yields  a  smaller  amount  of
exfoliated graphene nanosheets, whereas high power probe son-
ication yields a higher concentration of graphene nanosheets. The

concentration of exfoliated graphene nanosheets shows a linear re-
lationship with the energy supplied during sonication. High power
sonication for longer times yields few-layers graphene. Liu et al.
[120] reported the exfoliation of natural graphite flakes in differ-
ent organic solvents (BA, NMP, DMA, CYC, BNBZ) with addition of
NaOH for the formation of graphene. NaOH can easily intercalate
into the graphite sheets in the presence of organic solvents, signif-
icantly increasing the interlayer spacing of graphite. The intercala-
tion of NaOH weakens the Van der Waals interplanar binding force,
making the graphite sheets easier to exfoliate. Fig. 3 shows that
with the addition of NaOH, graphene yield significantly improved
for all the liquids used. In the case of CYC, NaOH improved the
yield by more than 20 times. Experimental evidence revealed that
the thickness of graphene sheets was in the range of 1–5 nm, cor-
responding to the formation of monolayer to few-layer graphene.

Monolayer  and  few-layer  graphene  were  synthesized  in  su-
percritical  DMF  using  expandable  graphite  in  less  than  15 min
with the help of a sealed stainless-steel reactor, as described by
Liu  et  al.  [121] .  In  a  detailed  study,  Hernandez  et  al.  [116]  ex-
plained  the  liquid  exfoliation  of  bulk  graphite  with  a  series  of
organic  solvents  (NMP,  DMA,  GBL  and  DMEU).  The  authors  con-
cluded  that  a  solvent  with  surface  tension  around  40  mJm −2 ,
such  as  NMP,  was  the  best  candidate  for  mass-production  of
graphene sheets. Park et al. [64] obtained high quality graphene
sheets  by  processing  commercial  expandable  graphite  interca-
lated  with  oleum  and  suspended  in  DMF.  Upon  the  addition
of  tetrabutylammonium  hydroxide,  the  molecule  inserted  into
the  oleum-intercalated  graphite  and  increased  the  distance  be-
tween  adjacent  graphite  layers,  as  shown  in  Fig.  4 .  Further
sonication  in  1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine- N -
[methoxy(polyethyleneglycol) −50 0 0] (DSPE-mPEG) yielded homo-
geneous single-layer graphene sheets.

NMP was suggested by Hernandez et al. [116] . The energy required
to exfoliate graphene is balanced by the solvent-graphene interac-
tion for solvents whose surface energies match that of graphene.
Park et al. [122] obtained graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) with min-
imum defects in the basal planes employing liquid phase exfoli-
ation of edge-functionalized expanded graphite in 1-aminopyrene
(Py-NH
2 ) and NMP using bath-type sonicator. Exfoliated GNPs ex-
hibited  thicknesses  lower  than  7 nm,  showing  stable  dispersibil-
ity in organic media after 9 months. Lotya et al. [123] suggested
that graphene can be exfoliated from graphite in water by using
sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS). The surfactant also stabi-
lized graphene monolayers against aggregation. By employing den-
sity gradient ultracentrifugation, controlled layered graphene has
been isolated using sodium cholate, by [124] as shown in Fig. 5 . In
this study, Green et al. have described a quantitative relationship

established between the buoyant density ( ρ( N )) and the thickness
of graphene (N) in aqueous surfactant solutions. The authors have
developed a geometrical model of ρ( N ) for the graphene-sodium
cholate complex and suggested the following relationship:

ρ( N ) =

ρs N + 2 m sc σ + 2 ρH 2 O t H
( N + 1 ) t gr + 2 t A + 2 t H

where  ρs  =  7.66 × 10 −8 g/cm 2  (sheet  density  of  graphene),
m sc  =  7.15  × 10 −22 g  (mass  of  one  sodium  cholate  molecule),
t gr represent  the  interlayer  distance  of  graphene  (0.34 nm).  The
thickness  of  the  graphene  sheet  is  given  by  N ,  which  specifies
the  average  number  of  graphene  layers  inside  sheet  separated
by  graphene  interlayer  distance  ( Fig.  5 b).  On  both  sides  of  the
graphene sheet is an anhydrous layer of thickness t A containing the
sodium cholate encapsulation layer. The sodium cholate molecules
in  this  region  coat  the  graphene  surface  with  surface  packing

The surfactant-assisted liquid phase exfoliation of graphite into
graphene  nanosheets  by  using  perylene  tetracarboxylate  was  re-
ported by Narayan et al. [125] . The as-synthesized graphene flake
dimensions were up to the 10–12 μm range. In a study comparing
the exfoliation of natural graphite powder on organic solvents with
or without the addition of common organic salts [126] , DMSO with
sodium citrate displayed highly enhanced exfoliation efficiency, as
shown in Fig. 6 . Furthermore, the authors observed that the ex-
foliation  in  this  mixed  solution  resulted  in  single  and  few-layer
graphene nanosheets free from defects and oxides.

The exfoliation of graphite in ethanol using sonication assisted
with curcumin has been studied by Navik et al. [127] . By adjust-
ing the concentration of curcumin, the amount of graphite, son-
ication  time  and  power,  the  authors  maximized  the  exfoliation
of defect-free graphene. Mixed solutions of water and TMU have
been used to exfoliate graphite into graphene [128] . The solvent-
cosolvent  interactions  were  shown  to  play  a  important  role  in
the high-yield exfoliation of graphite to form few-layer graphene.

The  exfoliation  efficiency  of  graphite  containing  oxygenic  func-
tional groups edges into few-layer graphene by hydrazine hydrate
2 O) and hydrogen (at 800 °C) has been enhanced by ∼37%
(N
using a lithium-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation approach [51] . The
oxygenic functional groups hinder lithium atom intercalation into
graphite ( Fig. 7 ), but synthesized few-layer graphene shows high
degree of structural integrity with few defects.

The  formation  of  high  quality  graphene  from  graphite  using
an  electrochemical  method  has  been  proposed  as  a  fast  exfoli-
ation  approach  [129–134] .  The  intercalation  of  ionic  electrolyte
species takes place into graphite by applying an electrical poten-
tial between two electrodes. Several kinds of anionic or cationic
electrolyte species have been used to accelerate the intercalation
amongst graphite layers. Wang et al. [135] applied poly (sodium-4-
styrenesulfonate) to synthesize graphene sheets under a voltage of
5 V. The graphene formation yield was 15% for production of sin-
gle or few-layered stacks. The graphene dispersion remained stable
for six months without any sedimentation. Su et al. [131] achieved
high-quality  thin  graphene  films  from  fast  electrochemical  ex-
foliation  using  DC  voltages  applied  to  a  graphite  anode  and  a

[136] demonstrated the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in
the presence of an ionic liquid (1-octyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hex-
afluorophosphate). The synthesized graphene sheets exhibited, on
average, the thickness of 1.1 nm and areas around 0.35 μm 2 . The
1-octyl-3-methyl-imidazolium free radicals have sufficient poten-
tial to interact with the π -electrons of graphene, facilitating the
exfoliation  procedure.  Parvez  et  al.  [99]  studied  the  effect  of  an
acidic solution in the exfoliation of graphite into graphene. Natural
graphite flakes were used as electrodes for electrochemical exfoli-
4  at 10 V ( Fig. 8 ). According to the authors, the as-
ation in H

have large sheet size and low oxygen content.

Controlled  electrochemical  exfoliation  of  graphite  in  aque-
ous  ammonium  sulfate  electrolytes  to  produce  high  quality
graphene  in  large  quantities  has  been  demonstrated  by  Yang
et  al.  [137] .  The  radicals  (e.g.,  HO ·)  generated  from  water
electrolysis  were  responsible  for  defect  formation  in  graphene
during  electrochemical  exfoliation.  A  series  of  reducing  agents
(e.g.,  (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl  (TEMPO),  gallic  acid,
4  and  HI)  have  been  suggested  as  additives
C
to eliminate the radicals, thus controlling the exfoliation process.
TEMPO-assisted  exfoliation  results  in  large  graphene  sheets  (5–
10 μm  on  average)  with  high  hole  mobilities.  Fluorine  modified
graphene has been also synthesized by an electrochemical method
for energy-related applications by Zhou et al. [138] . Graphite and
Pt foils were selected as working and counter electrode, respec-
tively. The two electrodes were immersed (distance between elec-
trodes = 2 cm) in 0.1 M NaBF
4 aqueous electrolyte. Electrochemical
exfoliation was conducted by applying positive potential (10 V for
15 min) and the exfoliated product was collected on a PTFE mem-

brane (pore size 0.2 μm) by filtration. After washing with DI water
and sonication, the final product was fluorine-modified graphene.
Different kinds of electrolyte solutions have already been used for
the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite. Table 1 shows some de-
tails about synthesis conditions and the results of electrochemical
exfoliation for the formation of mono to few-layers graphene from
graphite.

2.1.3. Unzipping of carbon nanotubes

2 SO

4 ,  KMnO

The  unzipping  of  CNTs  is  an  efficient  top-down  approach  for
the synthesis of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The unzipping of
CNTs  has  been  performed  through  different  methods:  (i)  Chem-
ical  methods  using  oxidizing  agents  like  H
4  etc.,  (ii)
exfoliation  of  multi-walled  CNTs  (MWCNTs)  followed  by  interca-
lation,  (iii)  longitudinal  cutting  of  nanotubes  by  metal  NPs,  (iv)
electrochemical  processes,  (v)  electrical  process  (i.e.  applying  an
electron beam to nanotubes), (vi) laser-induced unzipping of CNTs
etc. [74,94,148–151] . Among these, the chemical synthetic route is
the most effective one because of the production of high quality
graphene with high yield. Kosynkin et al. [74] synthesized GNRs
through longitudinal unzipping of both MWCNTs and single-walled
CNTs  (SWCNTs)  by  a  facile  oxidation  process  in  solution  phase.
In this chemical process, CNTs were first treated with H
4 and
then  with  KMnO
4  at  temperatures  in  the  55–70 °C  range  (Tour’s
method) Fig. 9 a,b represent the schematic chemical unzipping of
CNTs and Fig. 9 c,d shows TEM images of both semi and fully un-
zipped CNTs. The resultant GNRs were found to be soluble in sev-
eral common solvents including water, ethanol, common organic
solvents etc. Even though the nanoribbons exhibited relatively low
electrical conductivity, the chemical reduction still caused a drastic
improvement.

GNRs have also been synthesized by electrochemical unzipping
of  MWCNTs,  as  reported  by  Shinde  et  al.  [152] .  In  this  electro-
chemical process, the transformation of MWCNTs (used as working
electrodes) to graphene was performed by applying the anode po-
tential of 0.70 V vs mercury/ mercury(I) sulfate electrode. It is im-
portant to notice that the resulting GNRs exhibited lesser defects
than the chemically synthesized GNRs Fig. 10 a. In fact, the ribbons
were found to be very long (1 μm) with smooth edges. Recently,
Mondal et al. [153] demonstrated the synthesis of GNRs through

unzipping of SWCNTs in aqueous solution, with a Pd-based metal
complex  working  as  the  ‘sacrificial  chemical  scissor’  ( Fig.  10 b).
The  authors  developed  an  efficient  electro-active  hybrid  catalyst
by using these graphitic carbon-coated Pd NPs. The material dis-
played excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic
acid.  Functionalized  GONRs  exhibited  excellent  surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) [154] . In this work, the researchers syn-
thesized  GONRs  by  following  the  modified  Tour’s  method.  Later
on,  the  GONRs  were  further  functionalized  with  S-Trityl  (S-Trt)

4  and KMnO

An optimized synthesis technique for obtaining GO nanoribbons
(GONRs) has been reported by Higginbotham et al. [155] By adopt-
ing a modified Tour’s method, CNTs were longitudinally unzipped
4  in  the  reaction  system  along
3 PO
by  adding  a  weak  acid  like  H
with H
4  ( Fig. 11 ). This modified approach gener-
ated high-quality GONRs with minor defects. Recently, researchers
are focusing on the modification/functionalization/doping of GNRs
for further enhancement of their properties [156–158] . For exam-
ple, porous GNR aerogels were synthesized by direct unzipping of
2 particles were syn-
CNT sponges [159] . GNRs with anchored RuO
thesized as the cathode materials for Li-O
2 batteries [160] . In an-
other study, α-Co(OH)
2  nanosheets were in-situ grown on GNRs
to form a belt-like conductive material, which exhibited good ORR
activity [161] .

2.2. Bottom-up approaches: non-graphitic carbon sources

In bottom-up approaches, organic molecules in the form of gas,
solid  or  liquid  are  converted  into  graphene  materials  after  de-
composition at high temperature in the absence of oxygen. After
decomposition,  the  carbon  atoms  self-assemble  into  the  hexago-
nal graphene structure. Bottom-up methods for graphene synthe-

2.2.1. Chemical vapor deposition

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is most widely used method
for synthesizing graphene, because it fulfills the requirements for
electronic applications (large area, high quality graphene), which
are frequently not achieved by exfoliation [162–164] . Another ad-
vantage of CVD is the flexible choice of carbon precursor materials
[10,165] . On the other hand, the cost of CVD synthesis of graphene
is higher than that of mechanical and liquid phase exfoliation.

In  the  CVD  method,  various  types  of  carbon  containing  sub-
stances  are  decomposed  at  high  temperature  in  the  absence  of
oxygen on metallic substrates for large area graphene growth. Ex-
amples of carbon sources may be solids (camphor, sucrose, poly-
mers), liquids (ethanol, benzene, hexane, turpentine oil) or gases
(C
4 ). Appropriate substrates are Cu, Ni, Au, Co, Pd,
Pt,  Ir,  Ru,  Re,  Rh  Ge  etc.  [166–172] .  The  growth  mechanism  in-
volves  several  steps  for  final  graphene  formation.  Depending  on
the substrate material, these steps may include decomposition, ad-
sorption, dissolution, dehydrogenation, diffusion, nucleation, segre-
gation and precipitation [173–175] . Carbon has relatively high solu-
bility in Ni at high temperatures, so carbon dissolved in Ni diffuses,
segregates and precipitates to form graphene (few to multi-layers)
[176] . On the other hand, carbon has very low solubility in Cu, so it

Among the various metals, Cu is presently the most extensively
used catalyst material (because of low carbon solubility), which of-
fers good control over the number of graphene layers formed. A
waterless  cleaning  method  of  Cu  foils  for  CVD  graphene  growth
was suggested by Zhang et al. [178] . The Cu foils were first an-
nealed  in  air  at  high  temperature  and  then  rapidly  cooled.  The
contaminated Cu surface layer was oxidized upon annealing and
separated from the metallic Cu during the cooling process. A flow
of Ar, H
4 was then introduced for the growth of
graphene. The role of Cu foil in-situ annealing in controlling the
size, shape and thickness of graphene domains using CVD was de-
scribed by Huet et al. [179] . The authors studied the correlation be-
tween the conditions for Cu foil in-situ thermal treatment and the
subsequent graphene growth. The impact of Cu pre-growth treat-
ments has been investigated by considering two different pressure
regimes (1 and 800 mbar) and various gas compositions (pure Ar,
Ar/H
2  mixtures).  The  annealing  of  Cu  in  a  hydrogen-
free environment favored the formation of defect-free multi-layer
graphene. Shin et al. [180] achieved direct CVD growth of graphene
films on 3D patterned sapphire substrates (PSS) by placing the tar-
get surfaces in contact with (or close to) a Cu catalyst. In their ex-
periments, a thick Cu foil (25 μm) was sandwiched between two
PSS substrates and the stack was thermally annealed at 10 0 0 °C
4  gas  was  introduced  as  a
under  a  H
precursor to initiate graphene growth ( Fig. 12 ). Uniform coatings
of few-layer graphene films on complex structures at the centime-
ter scale can be formed by this method. Wu et al. [181] described
the bottom-up fabrication of sulfur-doped graphene derived from
sulfur-annulated  nanographene  using  thermal  annealing.  The  so-
lution of tri-sulfur-annulated hexa-perihexabenzocoronene (SHBC)
(0.5 mg/mL  in  dichloromethane)  was  spin-coated  on  an  oxygen
plasma-treated silicon wafer and an Au protecting layer (thickness:
40 nm) was thermally evaporated over the SHBC film at low pres-
sure (2 × 10 −6 Torr). The samples were thermally annealed in a two
step process (400 °C and 800 °C; each for 30 min) with constant
heating rate (5 °C/min) in Ar atmosphere (100  sccm) for the for-
mation of sulfur-doped graphene.

2  atmosphere  and  then  CH

The 3D Ni nanowire foam as a catalyst has been used for CVD
growth of bulk scale graphene as applied by Min et al. [182] . The

graphene was synthesized at 670 °C, which was significantly lower
than the conventional growth temperatures (around 10 0 0 °C). The
synthesized 3D graphene revealed higher electrical conductivity as
well as a higher specific surface area due to its dense and inter-
connected pore structure. The effects of controlling the hydrogen
environment and the cooling rate during CVD graphene growth on
Ni were studied by Anisur et al. [183] . The slow cooling hindered
the formation of graphene (irrespective of the presence or absence
of hydrogen flow) and under rapid cooling conditions, the absence
of hydrogen flow restricted wrinkle formation on graphene. Dimin-
ished  wrinkle  formation  significantly  improved  the  durability  of
the resultant graphene coatings.

There  are  several  modifications  in  atmospheric  pressure  CVD
(APCVD)  for  lower  temperature  and  lower  pressure  synthesis  of
high quality graphene. Some of the most common variations are:
low pressure CVD (LPCVD, operated under sub-atmospheric pres-
sures),  ultra-high  vacuum  CVD  (UHVCVD,  operated  under  very
low pressures), plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), microwave plasma
CVD (MPCVD), microwave-assisted surface wave plasma CVD (MW-
SWP-CVD),  radio  frequency  plasma  enhanced  CVD  (RF-PECVD),
remote  plasma  enhanced  CVD  (r-PECVD),  surface  wave  plasma
CVD  (SWP-CVD)  and  inductively-coupled  plasma  CVD  (ICPCVD)
[184,185] .  Several  kinds  of  carbon  precursors  and  catalysts  have
been used for the formation of single to multi-layer CVD graphene.
The synthesis methods and conditions are summarized in Table 2 .

2.2.2. Epitaxial growth

An  alternative  method  to  produce  epitaxial  graphene  is  to
use  SiC  as  both  carbon  source  and  substrate.  Considerable  ef-
fort  is  currently  in  progress  to  achieve  graphene  using  SiC  as
substrate  [241–248] .  During  epitaxial  growth  of  graphene,  SiC  is
thermally  decomposed  at  high  temperature  in  UHV,  and  under
these conditions the Si sublimates, leaving a carbon-rich surface
in the form of a single or few-layers of graphene on top of the
substrate  [249–253] .  Graphitic  films  can  be  grown  using  4H-SiC
and 6H-SiC surfaces by sublimating superficial Si during heating
above  ∼1200 °C  in  UHV  [85,253–258] .  After  the  interface  layer
formation ( Fig. 13 a), the silicon atoms can evaporate either by the
step edges (leading to in-plane or horizontal diffusion), or by the
defects present on the interface layer, (leading to vertical diffusion)
as explained by Ouerghi et al. [259] . Graphene grows at the step

edges and some graphene flakes are also formed, scattered over
the  terraces,  as  shown  in  Fig.  13 b.  As  the  surface  graphitization
progresses,  the  step  flow  front  propagates  toward  the  center  of
the terraces, while the flakes coalesce, increasing the domain sizes
( Fig. 13 c). Once the first monolayer is formed, the silicon atoms
can  still  diffuse  through  the  step  edges  or  through  the  defects
present on the graphene layer to form bilayers ( Fig. 13 d) [259] .

The growth of thin films of ordered graphene on the SiC(0 0 0  ̄1 )
surface via Si sublimation was investigated by Hass et al. [260] ..
The  C-face  4H-  SiC(0 0 0  ̄1 )  samples  were  processed  by  heat-
ing  to  1430 °C  for  5–8 min  in  a  RF-induction  vacuum  furnace
( P = 1 × 10 −5 Torr). These conditions produced graphitic films hav-
ing 4–13 graphene layers. Kim et al. [244] studied the formation of
bilayer quasi-free-standing epitaxial graphene on SiC(0 0 01) by mi-
crowave annealing in air. By annealing monolayer graphene grown

and  4H-SiC  (0 0 01).  Epitaxial  graphene  was  achieved  on  the  Si-
terminated faces of the substrates by Si sublimation in Ar gas (at
20 0 0 °C). The changes in the morphology of the graphene layers
on different SiC polytypes were linked to the minimization of the
terrace surface energy. The lower substrate surface roughness re-
sults in more uniform step bunching with a lower distribution of
step heights and subsequently better quality of graphene. Large ar-
eas with homogeneity of graphene monolayers (MLs) were found
on 3C-SiC (1 1 1) substrates ( Fig. 14 ).

The thickness uniformity of graphene grown on 4H-SiC (0 0 01),
6H-SiC  (0 0 01),  and  3C-SiC  (111)  substrates  by  high-temperature
sublimation was studied by Yakimova et al. [262] . Differences in
uniformity of graphene on different SiC polytypes were mainly re-
lated  to  the  minimization  of  terrace  surface  energy  during  step
bunching  process.  The  lower  substrate  surface  roughness  results
in more uniform step bunching and consequently better graphene
quality.  Trabelsi  and  co-workers  [263]  studied  the  morphologi-
cal imperfections of epitaxial graphene grown on 6H-SiC using a

confinement-controlled sublimation process. Graphene was grown
from  a  semi-insulating  on-axis  6H-SiC  (0 0 0–1)  (C-face)  under
an Ar  atmosphere and relatively low  temperature. The  graphene
growth  stage  involved  subjecting  the  sample  to  an  Ar  gas  par-
tial pressure of P = 2 × 10 −5 Torr and a Si sublimation rate of one
monolayer/  min.  During  this  process  the  substrate  was  heated
by electron-bombardment in the temperature range 1200 −1350 °C.
Zheng  et  al.  [264]  reported  synthesis  of  unidirectional  arrays  of
vertically aligned monolayer to few-layer graphene nanosheets on
6H-SiC substrates (nitrogen-doped on-axis C-face) by using physi-
cal vapor transport system [265] . First, SiC substrates were placed
in  a  graphite  crucible  (C-face  at  top  side)  and  the  crucible  was
loaded  into  the  growth  chamber.  Induction-coupled  heating  was
applied to raise the temperature (1600 °C in 3 h; Pressure 30 kPa)
in  Ar  gas  atmosphere.  After  that,  the  chamber  was  evacuated
( < 10 −3 Pa) and the samples were kept for 0.5 or 2 h for obtain-
ing  different  sizes  of  vertically  grown  graphene.  Taisuke  et  al.
[266]  studied  the  morphology  of  in-vacuum  prepared  graphene
films using SiC(0 0 01) with a base pressure of 3 × 10 −11 mbar. The
substrate  surfaces  being  converted  to  graphene  layers  of  differ-
ent thicknesses varied with the annealing temperature. Low-energy
electron microscopy (LEEM) images after two successive annealing
cycles (1280 and 1310 °C) demonstrate the early stage evolution of
graphene formation at elevated temperatures ( Fig. 15 a,b). Both im-
ages (taken at the same electron energy) exhibited three distinct
intensities, corresponding to the bare substrate and to monolayer
and bilayer graphene regions.

Reported research work shows that SiC materials have been fre-
quently used for the epitaxial development of graphene by thermal
decomposition. Details of processing and the corresponding num-
ber of graphene layers are shown in Table 3 .

2.3. Laser synthesis: carbon containing sources

Laser processing of graphene materials brings important advan-
tages such as simple and rapid patterning and localized energy de-
livery. Several parameters, including laser power, scanning rate and
pulse width can be changed in order to achieve the desired num-
ber of graphene layers and structural quality from various carbon
materials [277] . Laser-assisted methods have been used for growth
and  patterning  graphene  employing  a  variety  of  carbon  sources.
Laser processing of graphene has been widely reported using tech-
niques such as laser induced CVD, laser ablation/pulsed laser depo-
sition (PLD), laser exfoliation, laser induced epitaxial growth, laser
induced unzipping of CNTs and direct laser writing [278–282] .

In principle, laser induced CVD allows local heating of a sub-
strate/catalyst either in vacuum or gas atmosphere for direct depo-
sition and patterning of graphene materials within the focal spot
of a laser. The irradiated region reaches the desired temperature
almost  instantly  ( ∼1 ps)  by  absorbing  the  laser  thermal  energy
through inelastic electron-phonon coupling [283,284] . The very fast
heating rate results in a rapid temperature rise in the substrate,
promoting the decomposition of carbon precursors [285] . As the
laser spot moves forward on the substrate, local temperature can
drop  abruptly.  Upon  cooling,  the  solubility  of  carbon  is  reduced
and  thus  the  additional  carbon  atoms  out-diffuse  to  the  surface
of the catalyst layer, forming the graphene layers [286] . This tech-
nique is important due to the short processing time (including no
need  for  solvent,  or  subsequent  treatments)  and  because  it  pre-
cludes any additional high temperature heating, unlike the com-
mon (thermal) CVD [287–290] .

4 / H

Fabrication of graphene patterns has been achieved using laser
induced CVD on Ni foils with a short process time, as described
by  Park  et  al.  [287] .  The  laser  beam  irradiates  the  Ni  foil  in  a
2  environment and allows direct writing of graphene pat-
CH
terns at room temperature. The considerably enhanced growth rate
of graphene patterns (100 μm 2  area grown in just 0.2 s) was as-
cribed to the rapid heating and cooling rates, typical of the laser
induced  CVD  processes.  In  another  study,  Park  et  al.  [288]  sug-
gested that transparent interconnections can be formed on Ni foil
by fast, single-step creation of graphene shapes using laser induced
CVD. The number of graphene layers was controlled by tuning laser
scan speed and graphene patterns were directly transferred to de-
sired positions on patterned electrodes. Jiang et al. [284] have also
described the synthesis of few-layer graphene under ambient con-
ditions by laser induced CVD on Ni plates (using CH
4  as carbon
source) and the effect of process parameters on uniform graphene
growth. The scanning speed and laser power were important fac-
tors for controlling the quality and number of graphene layers in
graphene ribbons. The number of graphene layers was easily con-
trolled by varying the laser scanning speed. Fig. 16 a schematically
shows the experimental setup and Fig. 16 b–e presents optical im-
ages of graphene deposits obtained using a laser power of 600 W
at  laser  scanning  speeds  from  1.3  to  3  mm/s.  Graphene  ribbons
(1.5 mm × 16 mm) were obtained at a scanning speed of 1.3 mm/s
and  a  laser  power  of  600 W.  Recently,  Tu  et  al.  [285]  produced
high-quality  and  large-area  few-layer  graphene  by  laser  induced
CVD on polycrystalline Ni foils. The number of graphene layers and
their quality was controlled by changing growth time, laser power
and cooling rate.

Pulsed  laser  deposition  is  a  well-known  method  for  obtain-
ing  numerous  allotropes  of  carbon  from  graphite.  Wang  et  al.
[291] have reported Ni-induced few-layer graphene formation by
laser  ablation  at  650 °C  using  a  graphite  target.  The  number  of
graphene layers was related to the relationship between the thick-
nesses  of  C  and  Ni  films,  which  was  controlled  by  varying  the
laser ablation time. Using pulsed KrF excimer laser, different kinds
of  metal films  have been studied  for  the  formation of  few-layer
graphene  using  carbon  targets  at  750  °C  [292,293] .  Koh  et  al.
[292] reported cooling rate and energy dependence of pulsed laser
fabricated few-layer graphene on Ni using a carbon target at re-
duced temperature (750 °C). The controlled cooling rate and laser
energy produce crystalline graphene layers. Cooling rates of 1 and

50 °C/min produced few-layer graphene and laser energy was less
critical, as long as it was kept below 100 mJ. In another study, the
same group compared the fabrication by PLD of low defect few-
layer graphene on different metals (Ni, Cu, Co and Fe) using a car-
bon target [293] . Graphene film was obtained on Ni but it was not
formed  on  the  surfaces  of  Cu,  Co  and  Fe  under  a  specific  cool-
ing profile. With a cooling rate of 1 °C/min followed by 20 °C/min,
few-layer graphene was only formed on Ni metal film ( Fig. 17 a,b).
With an increase in the cooling rate, largely defect-free few-layer
graphene with 100% substrate coverage could also be formed on
Co ( Fig. 17 c).

One step synthesis of porous and highly crystalline few-layer
graphene  by  laser  ablation  has  been  suggested  by  Kazemizadeh

et  al.  [294] .  Nickel  NPs  (2  at%)  were  mixed  with  graphite  pow-
der  by  ball  milling.  The  resulting  powder  mixture  was  pressed
(1300 kg/cm 2 ) in the shape of a disk for making the target. The
target was placed inside a quartz tube (length: 80 cm; diameter:
5 cm)  and  heated  at  1050  °C  (pressure:  300  mbar)  in  the  pres-
ence of  Ar  gas flow (2.4 l/min). Upon heating, a pulsed Nd-YAG
laser  ( λ:  1064 nm;  frequency:  10 Hz,  pulse  duration:  10 ns)  was
focused  on  the  target  pellet  in  an  area  of  12  mm 2  with  differ-

ent  laser  fluences  (3.5  and  5.5 J/cm 2 ).  The  ablated  carbon  atoms
from the target were deposited on a collecting surface at the other
end of the quartz tube. The structural characterization showed that
the deposits on the collector were porous graphene. Kumar et al.
[295] synthesized multi- and few-layer graphene on an insulating
substrate (fused silica) at different temperatures (room tempera-
ture, 300, 500, 700 °C) via PLD technique using a graphite target.

layers was investigated. The depositions carried out at room tem-
perature led to the formation of multilayer graphene ( Fig. 18 a,b),
whereas the ones performed at 700 °C generated no more than 5
graphene layers ( Fig. 18 c,d), due to the diffusion of carbon adatoms
at elevated substrate temperatures.

Laser  irradiation  techniques  applied  to  the  fabrication  of
graphene  from  various  kinds  of  polymers  and  photoresists  have
drawn  attention  due  to  rapid  localized  material  processing.  Wei
et al. [296] described a laser-based procedure to direct synthesis
of few-layer graphene on quartz (without metal catalyst). A pho-
toresist S-1805 film coated on quartz wafers was heated and then
decomposed  by  continuous-wave  laser.  The  carbon  atoms  from
the photoresist were dissolved in molten quartz and then segre-
gated to form graphene. Ye et al. [297] reported direct laser fab-
rication  of  large-area  and  patterned  graphene  at  room  tempera-
ture.  The  carbon-coated  Ni  surface  was  treated  by  laser  irradia-
tion (schematic Fig. 19 a) in order to obtain high quality few-layer
graphene ( Fig. 19 b,c). SEM image ( Fig. 19 b) provides boundaries on
Ni and wrinkles of graphene. The HRTEM images in Fig. 19 c(i–iv)
reveals 4 different edges of graphene, indicating that graphene of
2–4 layers was obtained. Uniform and high-quality graphene hav-
ing an extended size was obtained by laser processing at a rate of
28.8 cm 2 /min.

The direct laser writing process is a simple and cost-effective
approach to obtain high-quality graphene patterns directly on var-
ious  substrates  to  fabricate  advanced  functional  devices.  Direct
laser writing of graphene patterns on insulating substrates (glass,
SiO
2 /Si) have been performed by Xiong et al. under ambient condi-
tions using a femtosecond laser [298] . Fig. 20 a shows a schematic
representation  for  the  preparation  of  graphene  electrodes  by  di-
rect laser writing on glass or Si/SiO
2 substrates. Different kinds of
graphene patterns, such as text, spirals, line arrays and electric cir-
cuits have been drawn, with feature line widths down to 800 nm,
as shown in the optical images in Fig. 20 b–e. Luo et al. [299] have
also  described  direct  laser  writing  for  creating  porous  graphitic
structures  on  polyimide  film  (127 μm)  to  generate  graphitic  ar-
2  laser  at  ambient  condition.  Lee  et  al.

[300]  demonstrated  a  low-temperature,  spatially  controlled  and
scalable epitaxial graphene synthesis technique based on KrF ex-
cimer  laser  irradiation-induced  surface  decomposition  of  the  Si-
rich face of SiC single-crystals. The laser fluence could be used to
control the thickness of the graphene films down to a single mono-
layer.

Freestanding  few-layer  graphene  through  laser  exfoliation  of
HOPG has been suggested by Qian et al. [301] . The laser exfolia-
tion process of HOPG (schematic experimental setup with Nd:YAG
laser  is  shown  in  Fig.  21 a,b)  was  investigated  at  different  laser
fluences  and  distances  between  target  and  substrate.  The  differ-
ent  laser  fluences  were  highly  responsible  for  the  formation  of
different phases of carbon from HOPG. Three different phases as
amorphous  carbon,  few-layer  graphene  sheets  and  thin  graphite
films  were  obtained  at  laser  fluence  of  0.8,  5  and  20 J/cm 2 ,  re-
spectively  as  shown  in  SEM  images  in  Fig.  21 c–e.  Zhang  et  al.
[302]  reported  few-layer  graphene  on  transition-metal  templates
using super-short pulse laser plasma deposition. Transparent few-
layer graphene deposits with thicknesses less than 8 nm, widths
up to 350 nm and lengths of more than 3 μm were obtained us-
ing a KrF excimer laser. Graphene/ GNRs synthesized by laser in-
duced  unzipping  of  CNTs  contains  less  impurities  and  defect  as
compared to  chemically  unzipped CNTs.  Kumar  et  al.  [303] syn-
thesized GNRs by laser unzipping of CNTs and authors have used
KrF excimer laser irradiation on MWCNTs (undoped and doped) to
produce GNRs. The parameters (including the carbon sources) for
synthesis of graphene using various lasers are listed in Table 4 .

3. Synthesis of graphite oxide: oxidation of graphite powder

Graphite oxide contains carbon, oxygen and hydrogen and it can
be obtained by treating graphite powder with strong oxidizers [46] .
The oxidation of graphite powder in strong acids and the interca-
lation of alkali metals promote an increase in the spacing among
graphitic layers. As a result of the interlayer increase, the Van der
Waals forces become very weak. After washing with DI water and
other chemicals (to remove the remaining alkali metals and acids),
the graphite oxide can be used for further application purposes.

Brodie  [306] ,  Staudenmaier  [307] ,  Hofmann  [308,309]  and
Hummers [310] have all developed well known methods for the
oxidation of graphite. Fig. 22 shows the different methods along
with the main chemicals used for oxidation and intercalation. In
these methods, initially graphite is chemically treated with strong
3 etc.) for a period of time and the alkali
acids (HCl, H

3 ,  KMnO
metal  compounds  (KClO
lated  into  the  interlayer  spaces,  further  helping  in  the  breaking
of graphitic layers and in reducing the interactions among them.
Modified and improved versions of the above cited methods have
also been reported for the oxidation of graphite powder, offering
shorter processing times, milder chemical and thermal conditions
or a combination of both [311–316] .

4. Reduction and exfoliation of graphene oxide/ graphite oxide

Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has physical and chemical prop-
erties similar to those of graphene. The high electrical conductivity
of rGO is of particular importance for application in nano-devices.
Several GO/graphite oxide reduction methods have been employed
to minimize the amount of oxygen present on the surfaces of GO,

thus increasing its conductivity. Some of the most important re-
duction  strategies  involve  chemical,  thermal,  microwave  or  laser
treatments ( Fig. 23 ). Each method has its own advantages and dis-
advantages, as discussed in the following sub-sections.

4.1. Chemical reduction

Chemical  reduction  of  GO  removes  oxygen-containing  func-
tional groups attached to its surfaces, increasing its electrical con-
ductivity. Several types of chemicals have been used with the pur-

interlayer  spacing  was  first  slightly  expanded  by  the  formation
of  intermediate  boron  oxide  complexes  and  then  decreased  by
the gradual removal of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups along with
the  boron  oxide  complexes.  Guo  et  al.  [335]  developed  a  two-
step  reduction  process  for  GO  which  involves  a  deoxygenation
with NaBH

Hydroiodic acid (HI) is a highly effective low temperature re-
ducing agent for GO. Pei et al. [336] have reported reduction of
GO films using HI acid. The HI acid-reduced GO film can achieve
high  C/O  atomic  ratio  and  an  electrical  conductivity  better  than
the GO films reduced by N
4  ( Fig. 25 a). The cross-
sectional  view  of  the  HI  acid-reduced  film  ( Fig.  25 c)  contains
shrinkage of the film thickness due to the removal of the oxygen-
4 ) vapor-reduced
containing functional groups, but that of the (N
film ( Fig. 25 d) shows an expansion in thickness of more than 10
times, caused by gas release. Green reducing agents such as ascor-
bic acid, also known as Vitamin C, have achieved a great deal of
attention  for  the  reduction  of  GO.  Merino  et  al.  [325]  described
a  comparative  study  of  the  deoxygenation  efficiency  of  GO  sus-
pensions  by  different  reducing  agents  and  found  that  vitamin  C
was the only one showing high reduction performance. Different
kinds of others chemical have also been used for the reduction of
GO/graphite oxide as summarized in Table 5 .

4.2. Thermal annealing/reduction

Thermal reduction is a well-known method for the removal of
oxygen  functionalities  attached  to  the  surfaces  and  edges  of  GO
2  gas, as well
[345–351] . The fast heating of GO generates CO/CO
as reduction by effective removal of the oxygen functional groups.
The  formation  of  CO/CO
2  gases  generates  an  increasing  pressure
amongst the GO layers, leading them to exfoliate into smaller sizes
and fewer layers [352,353] . McAllister et al. [354] described for-
mation of functionalized graphene sheets by graphite oxide using
thermal expansion. The thermal exfoliation takes place when the
decomposition  rate  of  the  epoxy  and  hydroxyl  sites  of  graphite
oxide exceeds the diffusion rate of the evolved gases, generating
high pressures that overcome the van der Waals forces holding the
graphene sheets together. Some authors [354] have calculated that
a pressure of 40 MPa is induced inside the stacked layers at 200 °C
(the decomposition temperature of GO). This pressure increases to
130 MPa at 10 0 0 °C. The minimum pressure required to separate
two GO sheets (to exfoliate the layers) was numerically calculated
to be 2.5 MPa [354] . Wu et al. [355] suggested rapid thermal heat-
ing  of  GO  at  1050  °C  for  exfoliation  and  then  reduction  by  H
2
for 2 h at 450 °C. The as-prepared rGO exhibited a high electrical
conductivity of ∼1 × 10 3 S/cm. Wu et al. [356] have demonstrated
GO  reduction  by  arc  discharge  heating  in  a  gas  mixture  of  H
2

( ∼10 kPa pressure) and Ar (90 kPa pressure) to produce graphene
sheets from GO. The cathode and anode were graphite rods and GO
was loaded in the anode. The exfoliated graphene sheets exhibited
a high electrical conductivity. Becerril et al. [357] reported a study
of thermal reduction treatments for GO under a continuous flow of
ultrapure Ar at 400 °C for 3 h. Shang et al. [358] demonstrated the
reduction and exfoliation of GO using heat treatments under high
pressures  and  low  temperatures.  The  low-temperature  (260  °C)
thermal reduction process was carried out in a stainless steel auto-
2 atmosphere at 0–4 MPa pressure. The GO was
clave for 3 h in a N
reduced to graphene with fewer layers and the ratio of I
G in the
Raman spectrum decreased from 0.64 to 0.56. Schniepp [359] de-
scribed the production of graphene through thermal exfoliation of
graphite oxide. The thermal exfoliation and reduction of graphite
oxide was completed in Ar atmosphere at 1050 °C and the material
has a wrinkled sheet structure ( Fig. 26 a). The release of CO
2 leaves
behind vacancies and topological defects on the graphene sheets.
The carbon atoms and epoxy groups removed from the graphene
sheets generate the morphology shown in Fig. 26 b.

The reduction of GO by N

4 vapor and thermal annealing in
different environments is studied by Mattevi et al. [324] . The ther-
mal treatment on GO thin films was performed in UHV using Ar/H
2
reducing atmosphere. The removal of oxygen functionalities (C = O,
C( = O) –OH) occurs upon increasing the temperature (100–250 °C),
while  C –O  components  continue  to  decrease  up  to  450  °C.  The
overall rate of oxygen evolution was slightly lower between 300
and 450 °C in comparison with the loss between 150 and 300 °C.
The higher rate of oxygen evolution between 150 and 300 °C was
attributed to the presence of physisorbed water, trapped CO
2 , and
oxygen functionalities like C –O, C( = O)-(OH), C = O etc. Wang et al.
[360] fabricated graphene films from exfoliated graphite oxide fol-
lowed by thermal reduction. They observed that the electrical con-
ductivity  of  graphene  films  was  closely  related  to  the  annealing
temperature and the thickness of the films. Yang et al. [361] stud-
ied  the  removal  of  oxygen  functionalities  from  GO  at  three  dif-
ferent temperatures and under two conditions of atmosphere: an
Ar + H
2  mixture at atmospheric pressure and UHV (base pressure
6 × 10 −11 Torr). Significant reduction of GO was observed after the
high temperature treatments (10 0 0 °C), and when heating under
UHV, as observed by analysis of the XPS spectra ( Fig. 27 ). The C1s
and O1s XPS spectra of GO films treated at different tem peratures
2  atmosphere are shown in Fig. 27 a. Due to the increase
in Ar-H
in temperature, the peaks corresponding to C = O and O = C –OH dis-

appeared  after  the  10 0 0 °C  treatment  in  Ar–H
2  atmosphere.  The
C1s and O1s XPS spectra of GO films treated at different temper-
atures for 15 min in UHV are shown in Fig. 27 b. The C1s peak at
287.7 eV (C = O) and O1s peak at ∼530.6 eV (C = O, O = C –OH) have
both  decreased in  intensity  (in the  50 0–70 0 °C  range) and com-
pletely disappeared after the treatment at 900 °C. The disappear-
ance of the C1s and O1s XPS peaks indicates a high degree of GO
reduction due to the loss of oxygen-containing groups from the GO
surfaces.

The thermal exfoliation and reduction of graphite oxide at 700
and 10 0 0 °C in N
2  atmosphere was described by González et al.
[362] .  The  sp 2  domains  were  restored  after  thermal  treatment,
which implies the production of a graphene-like material with a
high electrical conductivity for application in electrodes for vana-
dium redox flow batteries. Li et al. [363] obtained N-doped rGO
(using NH
3 ) and undoped rGO sheets through thermal annealing.
In a study with GO sheets annealed at different temperatures, the
authors observed that N-doping occurs at temperatures as low as
300 °C, but the highest doping level of ∼5% N was achieved only
3 and
at 500 °C. Oxygen groups in GO favored the reaction with NH
C –N bond formation. Pre-rGO obtained by thermal annealing in H
2
3 and could only reach
exhibited greatly reduced reactivity with NH
a lower N-doping level ( Fig. 28 ). The GO samples annealed in NH
3
atmosphere exhibited higher conductivity than those annealed in
H

2 , signifying a extra effective reduction of GO.

4.3. Microwave reduction

Microwave  irradiation/heating,  a  fast  and  efficient  heating
method, has been widely used for intercalation and exfoliation of
graphite  [364,365] .  The  irradiation  by  microwaves  leads  to  uni-
form  rapid  heating  of  GO,  causing  removal  of  oxygen  functional
groups, with molecular vibration resulting in interlayer expansion
and reduction into rGO [366,367] . Microwave heating can provide
fast heating rates and yield graphene-metal oxide hybrid materi-
als with homogeneous oxide particle size distributions on rGO sur-
faces [368-380] . The technique has been widely used in multiple
studies to facilitate the reduction of GO for various purposes [381–
384] . Voiry et al. [385] reported a simple approach to produce rGO
using a conventional microwave oven operated at 10 0 0 W for 1–2 s
pulses.  Upon microwave irradiation,  arcing was observed around
GO typically lasting 50–100 ms. The authors correlated arcing with
GO  reduction  and  suggested  that  the  GO  temperature  increased

by a few thousand degrees Celsius during the reduction process.
Before microwave irradiation, a mild annealing was performed at
300 °C during 1 h in Ar atmosphere. The authors found that arc-
ing  was  not  observed  without  annealing  at  300  °C,  so  the  mild
annealing was thought to be crucial for effective exfoliation and
reduction. Kim et al. [386] have published results showing the re-
duction and exfoliation of GO in a microwave oven at 750 W for
30 s.  Fig.  29 a  shows  a  schematic  representation  for  reduction  of
GO through microwave. After the microwave irradiation, the peak
intensities of C –O, C = O, and O = C –OH are lowered, revealing the
strong decrease of oxygen content in GO ( Fig. 29 b,c). The C/O ratio

obtained from XPS was increased from 59:41 to 76:24 after mi-
crowave exposure.

Synthesis  and  study  of  rGO  layers  under  microwave  irradia-
tion/heating was reported by Sreedhar et al. [387] . Partially oxi-
dized graphite was irradiated in a domestic microwave (with sub-
sequent sonication) at 900 W for 60 s to obtain a few-layers of rGO.
Apparently, there were no oxygen functional groups left in the high
electrical  conductivity  material.  The  reduction  GO  was  also  car-
ried  out  by  heating  in  a  specialized  microwave  system  (10 0 0 W,
2450 MHz).  GO  was  irradiated  with  a  power  of  800 W  for  150 s
to  produce  rGO  [388] .  Zhu  et  al.  [389]  prepared  exfoliated  and

a thermal explosion and the release of gases. The main gaseous
products of such an explosive reduction process were CO
2 , CO and
2 . The specific surface area of microwave exfoliated graphite ox-
SO
ide was 600 m 2 /g and the volume was 6 cm 3 /g. The resulting rGO
exhibits  IR  spectra  similar  to  that  of  graphite  and  a  dc  conduc-
tivity of 0.12 S/cm. The effect of microwave irradiation/heating on
the reduction of GO films for the formation of few-layer graphene
carried  out  with  an  output  power  of  42 W  for  5 min  in  air  was
investigated  by  Han  et  al.  [366] .  No  temperature  over  250  °C
was  detected  during  the  microwave  irradiation/heating  process.
The results indicate that most of oxygen functional groups can be
eliminated by microwave irradiation/heating. The C/O ratio of the
few-layer  graphene  film  was  increased  from  7.8  to  17.5  and  the
large  GO  sheet  resistance  (10 7  (cid:8)/sq)  was  remarkably  decreased
to  ∼6 × 10 3  (cid:8)/sq.  Graphite  oxide  reduction  by  microwave  treat-
ment  was  described  by  Shulga  et  al.  [391] .  The  specific  surface
area of microwave exfoliated GO was ∼600 m 2 /g when measured
by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method based on the low-
temperature N
2  gas adsorption. The XPS analysis shows that the
rGO surface contains a small amount of oxygen.

The  vacuum-assisted  microwave  reduction/exfoliation  of
graphite oxide was studied by Wong et al. [392] . In this approach,
graphite oxide was placed in quartz glass ampoules for evacuation
(5 × 10 −5 mbar), and during the evacuation it was heated to 60 °C
to remove any traces of moisture. After sealing with an oxygen–
hydrogen flame, the ampoules were placed inside the microwave
reactor and irradiated for 3 min (1 kW, 2.45 GHz). The microwave
reduction/exfoliation of graphite oxide in a closed vacuum system
leads  to  high  C/O  ratios  and  partial  hydrogenation  of  graphene.
Park et al. [393] applied microwave irradiation to a mix of graphite
oxide/graphene  nanosheets  under  a  hydrogen  containing  atmo-
sphere, for obtaining high quality graphene nanosheets. When the
graphite oxide/ graphene nanosheets mixture ( Fig. 31 a) was placed
in the oven, the GO underwent an explosion with volume expan-
sion  after  10 s  microwave  irradiation/heating  ( Fig.  31 b).  Within
20 s  of  microwave  treatment,  several  intermittent  exfoliations  of
graphite oxide/graphene occurred and the resulting powder turned

reduced GO by microwave heating at 700 W for 1 min. During the
microwave treatment, a large volume expansion of the GO powder,
accompanied  by  ‘violent  fuming’  was  observed.  The  GO  powder
was dramatically expanded, yielding a black and fluffy rGO powder
( Fig. 30 a,b). The rGO contained many wrinkles and folded regions,
as revealed in TEM observations ( Fig. 30 c). The XPS results con-
firmed  the  significant  removal  of  oxygen-containing  groups.  The
C/O ratio increased from 0.79 (GO) to 2.75 (rGO), upon microwave
irradiation ( Fig. 30 d).

Graphite  oxide  film  was  exfoliated  and  reduced  into  a  mi-
crowave oven (2450 MHz, 900 W) and the emitted gases were anal-
ysed [390] . The microwave reduction of GO was accompanied by

ated  with  lasers  for  conversion  into  rGO,  aiming  at  various  ap-
plication  purposes.  Yang  et  al.  [406]  demonstrated  the  potential
of the GO powder reduction approach by pulsed ultraviolet laser
irradiation. Laser irradiation parameters included pulse repetition
frequency,  scanning  speed,  number  of  exposure  cycles  and  laser
fluence. The C/O ratios were improved with the increase in laser
fluence, in line with the decreasing number of oxygen-containing
groups remaining in the laser-treated material. The electrical re-
sistance sharply decreased from 280 M (cid:8) in the initial GO pow-
ders to 0.267 M (cid:8) in rGO powders irradiated at a laser fluence of
0.438 mJ/cm 2 . The C/O ratio increased from 0.232 in the initial GO
powder to 1.86 in the rGO powder after irradiation with laser flu-
ences of 0.525 mJ/cm 2 . Bhattacharjya et al. [407] described the di-
rect reduction of GO films into multilayer rGO films by CO
2 laser
pyrolysis. The irradiation with CO
2 laser generated localized heat-
ing and, as a result, the oxygen functional groups were expelled
from  the  GO  layers.  The  degree  of  reduction  in  multilayer  rGO
films could be controlled by varying the laser processing parame-
ters. XPS analysis indicated very low oxygen contents (C/O ratio of
9.77) with optimized laser parameters. Papazoglou et al. [408] per-
formed pulsed laser printing of GO patterns and then converted
the deposited material into rGO at room temperature for sensing
devices. Laser printing was performed using the laser induced for-
ward transfer (LIFT) technique, which allows fast deposition of liq-
uid and solid phase materials. GO was laser printed using single
pulses from the 4th harmonic (266 nm) of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser
(pulse width 4 ns, 2 Hz repetition rate), at a range of different laser
fluences  (10 0–50 0  mJ/cm 2 ).  Kasischke  et  al.  [410] ,  using  a  fem-
tosecond laser, studied the simultaneous reduction and nanopat-
terning of GO spin-coated onto SiO
2 substrates. Self-organized pe-
riodic  structures  of  rGO  appeared  on  the  GO  surfaces  upon  ir-
radiation at fluences slightly higher than the fluence needed for
GO reduction. Comparing the GO area exposed with a fluence of
11 mJ/cm 2  with another area exposed  at  34 mJ/cm 2 ,  the reduc-
tion in oxygen content was found to be more pronounced for the
latter.

The laser treatment of GO suspended in a liquid may produce
uniform  and  homogeneous  reduction.  An  aqueous  suspension  of
graphite  oxide  (in  Milli-Q  water)  was  reduced  into  high  quality
few-layers rGO at different laser energies and irradiation times us-
ing KrF excimer laser, as reported by Yang et al. [411] . After laser
reduction,  the  amount  of  oxygen  functional  groups  was  signifi-
cantly  reduced  from  50.7  to  11.2  at.%.  The  CC/CO  intensity  ratio
of graphite oxide is much lower (0.72) than CC/CO ratio of laser
reduced graphene (3.2), where “CC” refers to the sum of C –C and
C = C bonds and “CO” applies to chemical bonds including all com-
binations of carbon and oxygen. Change et al. [413] studied the re-
duction of GO in aqueous suspensions by femtosecond laser. Tun-
able  deoxygenation  of  GO  could  be  achieved  by  applying  differ-
ent laser irradiation times. The color of GO changed from yellow
brown to black with the increase of irradiation time. The atomic
C/O ratio increased from 1.7 for GO to 8.1 for rGO. Trusovas et al.
[414] demonstrated the reduction of graphite oxide in suspension
to graphene induced by picosecond pulsed laser irradiation. Differ-
ent laser parameters (laser power and scan speed) were selected to
draw rGO lines ( Fig. 32 ). Minimum amounts of structural defects in
graphene sheets were found at 50 mW laser power and 30 mm/s
scanning speed ( Fig. 32 c). Modeling of temperature dynamics re-
vealed that the temperature of the GO film irradiated with a sin-
gle laser pulse at a fluence of 0.04 J/cm 2 (50 mW) increased up to
1400 °C for a few nanoseconds, which was sufficient for the effec-
tive reduction of GO with successive laser pulses.

GO sheets suspended in ammonia solution were reduced to rGO
at  room  temperature  using  nanosecond  pulsed  laser  irradiation,
as  described  by  Ghadim  et  al.  [415] .  Upon  reduction,  the  peaks
in  XPS  related  to  the  oxygen-containing  functional  groups  were

from  yellowish  brown  to  black.  Upon  further  microwave  irradi-
ation for the next 20 s ( Fig. 31 c), a white light began to appear,
probably due to arc evolution from the powder in the quartz bottle
( Fig. 31 d). Low magnification HR-TEM images ( Fig. 31 e) indicated
that the graphene nanosheets have micrometre-sized flakes with
folded and stacked sheets. The high magnification HR-TEM image
of graphene nanosheets ( Fig. 31 f) shows a folded structure of the
graphene  nanosheets  edges,  which  suggests  the  presence  of  a
single layer or a few-layers of graphene nanosheets.

Graphite  oxide  was  irradiated  in  a  domestic  microwave  oven
for ∼20 s for exfoliation and reduction by Potts et al. [394] . XPS
measurements indicated the presence of oxygen-based functional
groups  on  the  platelets,  although  in  much  lower  concentration
than in the original GO. The synthesized rGO contains a relatively
high  C:O  ratio  (3.2:1)  when  compared  to  graphite  oxide  (1.4:1).
The microwave reduced graphite oxide had a specific surface area
of 432 m 2 /g. Yang et al. [395] demonstrated the synthesis of rGO
through  microwave  reduction  and  exfoliation  of  graphite  oxide
with a kitchen oven by applying a 5 min microwave exposure at
10 0 0 W. With a specific surface area of 465.7 m 2 /g, the obtained
rGO showed a high adsorption capacity for methyl blue.

4.4. Laser reduction

Recently, several groups have demonstrated that GO can be re-
duced by photo-irradiation using several types of lasers. The pro-
cess was mentioned in the literature as “photo-thermal reduction
using laser”, “selective reduction by direct laser writing”, and “laser
conversion” of GO/graphite oxide  to rGO  [396–404] . One of the
main advantages of reduction by laser is that the photo-irradiation
process does not need any chemicals or high temperature. Another
especially advantageous characteristic of the process is the short-
ening of the conversion times from several hours to a few minutes
[405–417] . Due to these advantages, GO powder has been irradi-

5. Graphene/GO for energy storage in LIBs

In recent years, graphene based materials used for LIBs became
a very promising energy storage technology due to their relatively
high energy density, wide working potential, high recharge abil-
ity,  low  self-discharge,  and  light  weight  [429–434] .  For  applica-
tion in LIBs, in most of the studies, the researchers have adopted
the oxidation of graphite by various methods (Hummer’s method,
Hofmann’s method, Staudenmaier’s method, Brodie’s method and
their modifications) followed by reduction (thermal/ chemical/ mi-
crowave/ laser) for the synthesis of porous rGO materials. For the
synthesis/modification of graphene-based hybrids/ composites for
electrode materials, hydrothermal/ solvothermal and thermal an-
nealing  processes  are  the  most  common  ones.  Freeze  drying  is
also one of the most beneficial processes for graphene-based hy-
brids/composite electrodes for LIBs. On the other hand, porous 3D
architectures of graphene/graphene-related material are highly de-
sirable for LIBs as they allow easy transport of electrolyte ions and
electrons in the electrode materials.

In order to supply enough power for the requirements of the
next generation of devices and applications, it is necessary to up-
grade  LIBs  in  terms  of  performance and  reliability  [435–441] . In
general, rechargeable LIBs work through the movement of Li-ions
during charging/discharging. The basic components of LIB cells are
anode, cathode and electrolyte. Even though, LIBs serve as an es-
sential tool for today’s rechargeable and portable electronics, they
suffer  from  a  few  serious  issues  such  as  limited  life  cycle,  low
energy density, some safety concerns and low cost effectiveness.
Trying to overcome these problems, many carbon-based materials
have been tested as components in LIBs. Among them, graphene,
GO  and  their  derivatives  have  drawn  considerable  attention  for
LIBs due to their exceptional properties such as better conductivity,
high surface area ( > 20 0 0 m 2 /g), and good charge carrier mobility
[4 42–4 45] . Herein, the current state of the art in graphene-based
LIB research is discussed in detail.

Carbon materials have been considered as good candidates for
application  in  LIBs  because  of  their  highly  conductive  nature.  A

substantially reduced, with the O/C ratio decreased from 49% to
21% after 10 min laser irradiation. Huang et al. [417] reported the
pulsed KrF excimer laser reduction of GO suspended in ammonia
solution in 5 min. A solution color change was observed after the
pulsed laser irradiation ( Fig. 33 a). The yellow–brown color imme-
diately turned black, indicating that GO could be rapidly reduced
by the treatment. After the irradiation, the thin folded-sheet struc-
ture of GO ( Fig. 33 b) was converted to rGO exhibiting randomly ag-
gregated, crumpled sheets ( Fig. 33 c). The laser-converted rGO films
showed a sheet resistance of 53.8 k (cid:8)/sq. Several types of laser sys-
tems have been used for reduction of GO/graphite oxide to rGO in
different atmospheres, as listed in Table 6 .

conductive carbon network is needed in order to promote effective
Li-ion  transfer  and  the  exchange  of  electrons.  In  this  context,
graphene with its excellent electrical properties has been consid-
ered as a prime candidate for LIBs. Moreover, the high diffusivity
of Li on the graphene planes enhance the rate capability. Owing
to its long-range π -conjugation, graphene also exhibits high ionic
mobility  and  ballistic  electron  transport  [4 46,4 47] .  Because  of
these attractive properties, graphene has been used not only pure,
as a negative electrode, but also as a conducting agent in metal
oxide  negative  electrodes.  The  theoretical  capacity  of  graphene
(764 mAh/g) is found to be twice that of the traditional graphite
electrodes [448] . The GO contains many oxygen-containing groups
including  epoxy,  carboxyl,  and  hydroxyl  groups.  By  changing
the concentration of these oxygen-containing groups, GO can be
turned into a material with tuneable electrical properties. It is also
important to note that GO has the capability to provide large num-
bers of active sites for anchoring electroactive materials. Overall,
graphene/GO-based materials modified with metal oxides exhibit
better  electrochemical  performance  for  LIB  applications.  Several
C/metal oxide hybrid structures, with widely varying morphologies
have  been  proposed  by  Raccichini  et  al.  as  shown  in  Fig.  34
[449] .

The  electrochemical  performance  of  porous  graphene-like
nanosheets  as  anode  materials  for  high  performance  LIBs  was
demonstrated  by  Zhao  et  al.  [450] .  The  porous  graphene-based
electrodes showed high discharge capacity of 830.4 mAh/g at the
current density of 100 mA/g. Even when subjected to an ultrahigh
current density (20 A/g), they still exhibited a moderate rate capac-
ity of 211.6 mAh/g. The authors also found excellent cycling stabil-
ity (near 100% capacity retention) for the electrode after 10,0 0 0 cy-
cles. These exceptional electrochemical properties were attributed
to the loosely packed porous nanosheet-like structure, which facil-
itated easy Li + diffusion and electron transport by shortening the
pathways. In another study, Channu et al. [47] reported the dis-
charge capacity of graphite oxide and GO deposited on stainless
steel and Cu meshes. While graphite oxide exhibited the highest
discharge  capacity  (of  940  mAh/g)  on  the  Cu  mesh,  GO  showed

the  value of  897.7 mAh/g  on  the  stainless steel  mesh  (at  a  cur-
rent density of 50 mA/g). However, both electrodes exhibited sub-
stantial  drop  in  capacity  after  the  first  cycle,  caused  by  the  for-
mation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and the reaction of
Li-ions with oxygen functional groups. According to the authors,
the  high  capacity  of  these  electrodes  was  caused  by  their  high
surface area. The major disadvantage noticed for these electrodes
was the abrupt capacity fading during the discharge process. This
problem of rapid capacity fading could be solved by using addi-
tional graphene as a conductive component of the electrodes. By
making a conductive bridge and complimentary surface contacts,
graphene has enhanced the electrochemical performance of artifi-
cial graphite (AG), as reported by Guo et al. [451] . With the ad-
dition of 10 wt.% graphene, the reversible capacity of AG reached
422 mAh/g, which is higher than the values for acetylene black-
containing AG electrodes. The enhancement was assigned to the
high capacity of graphene and the formation of a better conductive
network. As a result, a thin and dense SEI film was formed, en-
abling good rate performance and cycling stability. The electrodes
exhibited a high capacity retention (of 97.2%) after 30 cycles.

The  capacity  of  graphene  can  also  be  enhanced  by  combin-
ing  it  with  other  carbon-based  materials.  In  the  early  stages  of
graphene research, Yoo et al. [452] reported the enhancement of
the specific capacity of graphene nanosheets from 540 to 730 and
784 mAh/g after the incorporation of CNTs and C
60 , respectively.
Interestingly, this improvement in capacity was originated from the
significant enhancement of the d -spacing due to the presence of
the π -electron network of CNT and C
60 . As suggested by the au-
thors,  the  enhancement  in  the  d -spacing  of  the  graphene  layers
created additional sites for the accommodation of Li-ions, result-
ing in the increase in capacity.

Another way to enhance LIB performance is to introduce defects
on the graphene sheets. This strategy is based on the idea that the
defects on graphene can accommodate additional Li and enhance
the  charge  capacity.  For  the  synthesis  of  disordered  graphene,
Pan  et  al.  [453]  prepared  different  kinds  of  rGO  through  differ-
ent  synthetic  strategies  including  hydrazine  reduction,  pyrolytic

de-oxidation  and  electron  beam  irradiation.  The  researchers  ob-
served the highest discharge and charge capacities (of 2042 and
1054 mA  h/g,  respectively)  for  electron  beam-reduced  GO.  The
graphene  sheets  with  induced  defects  exhibited  higher  charge-
discharge  capacities  than  conventional  graphite  electrodes.  Py-
rolytic rGO sheets displayed higher capacity retention (82%) than
electron-beam-irradiated GO (74%) after 15 cycles. The authors cor-
related the values of the I
G ratio with the reversible capacity to
understand the role of defects on the electrochemical performance.
From different characterization techniques, including Raman spec-
troscopy, HRTEM and EPR, it has been concluded that the electron-
beam-reduced GO exhibited the highest number of defects, includ-
ing edge defects, topological defects, disordered carbon etc. While
the  defects  at  the  interface  between  nanosheets  and  electrolyte
were responsible in accommodating the irreversible Li, the defects
at  the  edge  sites  and  internal  defects  of  the  nano-domains  en-
trenched in graphene nanosheets were involved in the reversible
Li storage ( Fig. 35 ). The capacity fading during cycling could also
be ascribed to the structural instability induced by the defects.

Another way to enhance battery performance is to create de-
fects  in  graphene  by  heteroatom  doping.  Doping  can  play  an
important  role  in  enhancing  Li  storage  capacity  by  allowing  a
smoother intercalation of Li. Jiang et al. [454] reported the synthe-
sis of N-doped graphene from three different precursors, including
graphite oxide, GO and rGO. Melamine was used as the N source.
Among the doped electrodes, N-doped rGO exhibited the highest
reversible  capacity  of  1250.8  mAh/g.  The  high  capacity  was  at-
tributed to the high surface area (687.7 m 2 /g) generated by induc-
tion of defects and removal of oxygen-containing groups through
reduction. Moreover, N-doped rGO also kept a higher capacity af-
ter 30 cycles than the other two doped specimens. Even the pres-
ence  of  micropores  in  graphene  can  improve  LIB  performance.
Jiang et al. [455] synthesized N-doped holey graphene hollow mi-
crospheres (NHGHSs) and nitrogen doped graphene hollow micro-
spheres (NGHSs) using a sacrificial template method. As shown in
SEM and TEM images ( Fig. 36 a,b), the holey graphene achieved a
high specific surface area of 948 m 2 /g, which is higher than for
most graphene-based materials. The NHGHSs displayed reversible
capacities of ∼1563 mAh/g at a low rate of 0.5 C and ∼254 mAh/g
at a high rate of 20 C ( Fig. 36 c). Fig. 36 d shows that microspheres
displayed  ultrahigh  discharge  and  charge  capacities  of  2875  and

1923  mAh/g,  respectively,  for  the  first  cycle.  The  electrodes  also
exhibited a high energy density of 637.4 Wh/kg with a power den-
sity of 182.4 W/kg. Furthermore, the low electrolyte charge-transfer
resistance  enabled  easy  ion  diffusion  and  electron  transfer.  The
enhanced electrochemical properties of this doped material were
explained by its high conductivity and the presence of pyridinic
N,  which  increased  the  adsorption  energy  and  reduced  the  en-
ergy  hurdle  for  Li +  ion  penetration.  Reddy  et  al.  [456]  studied
the  improved  capacitive  properties  of  N-doped  graphene,  which
was  grown  on  a  Cu  current  collector  by  the  CVD  technique.  By
increasing the number of surface defects, the N-doped graphene
achieved almost double the reversible discharge capacity of pris-
tine graphene. The presence of topological defects and pyridinic N
atoms were the key factors for this enhancement. Additionally, the
direct contact between the doped electrode and current collector
also reduced the electronic resistance.

Another  approach  to  enhance  battery  performance  is  the  co-
doping of graphene. The N and S co-doped graphene demonstrated
a high initial reversible capacity of 1016 mAh/g at a high current
density of 100 mA/g by creating more active sites through synergis-
tic effects between N and S [457] . Most importantly, as compared
to pristine graphene, the co-doped graphene exhibited better ini-
tial columbic efficiency by reducing the residual oxygen-containing
functional groups. Other than N and S, halogens can also be con-
sidered as prominent candidates for graphene doping due to their
high reactivity and conductive nature. Liu et al. [458] reported the
electrochemical  performances  of  N  and  Cl  dual-doped  graphene.
Benefiting  from  the  copious  defects  and  the  expansion  of  inter-
layer spacing, this dual-doped graphene achieved a high specific
capacity of 1200 mAh/g at the current density of 0.1 A/g and good
rate capability (1010 mAh/g at 1.0 A/g). Most interestingly, the elec-
trode exhibited a high capacity retention of 95% after 1800 cycles.
In this case, at a low dopant level (2.08%), the p-type dopant Cl en-
hanced the carrier mobility and conductivity of graphene. On the
other hand, N doping increased the number of active sites and the
electron mobility.

In  addition  to  heteroatom  doping,  structural  modification  of
graphene  can  be  used  a  valid  approach  to  enhance  the  cycle
life  of  LIBs.  Liu  et  al.  [459]  reported  the  excellent  LIB  perfor-
mance  of  N-doped  monolithic  quasi-graphene  films  with  porous
carbon  frameworks.  Although  the  film  exhibited  low  reversible

capacity (493 mAh/g), the cycling stability was very high (98% af-
ter 50 0 0 cycles) ( Fig. 37 ). The quasi-graphene film still achieved
higher capacity and rate capability than commercial graphite. Ad-
ditionally, it also displayed a high energy density of 72.5 Wh/kg at
an ultrahigh power density of 10.7 kW/kg. The better electrochem-
ical performance was attributed to its unique structural features
and  synergistic  effects  from  both  the  monolithic  structure  and
N-doping.

Electrodes based on Graphene/GO paper have been also inves-
tigated for application in LIBs [460,461] . Lu et al. [462] prepared
a graphene/GO paper through vacuum filtration, which exhibited
excellent conductivity and structural properties. With this highly
conductive network, the paper electrode achieved a high discharge
capacity of 2900 mAh/g and a charge capacity of 702 mAh/g. Ad-
ditionally, the electrode maintained a moderate charge capacity of
530 mAh/g after 55 cycles. Most importantly, this electrode was
operated without any conductive additives or binders as the GO
itself acted as the active Li-storage material and film stabilizer.

Functionalized  graphene  paper  has  been  also  investigated  as
high-capacity anode for LIBs. The functionalization was carried out
by grafting polycaprolactone onto the graphene sheets [463] . This

super-tough paper electrode exhibited an initial discharge capacity
of 977 mAh/g at a current density of 300 mA/g. The polymer not
only expanded the interlayer spacing of graphene paper, but also
enhanced the Li-ion diffusion, therefore improving battery perfor-
mance. Alcohol-modified graphene papers were also examined as
LIB anodes. Oh et al. [464] investigated the electrochemical perfor-
mance of graphene papers modified with different alcohols, includ-
ing methanol, 1-butanol, 1-hexanol and 1-octanol. The 1-Octanol
modified flexible graphene electrode displayed a discharge capac-
ity of 1852 mAh/g. The authors observed that the capacity of these
modified graphene paper electrodes was increased as the chain-
length  of  the  alcohol  increased.  After  modification  by  the  alco-
hols, additional Li storage sites were generated by the expansion
of graphene interlayer spacing and by additional cavities formed
on the graphene sheets. These consequences of alcohol treatment
resulted in high LIB performance, including high capacity and long
cycle life.

In  the  continuous  search  for  further  improvement  of  battery
performance, different forms of graphene/GO have been combined
with other electroactive substances and investigated as both anode
and cathode materials for LIBs.

5.1. Graphene/GO-based materials as anodes for LIBs

5.1.1. Graphene/GO with metal oxides

In recent years, metal oxides, especially transition metal oxides,
have drawn considerable attention as anode materials for LIBs due
to  its  high  theoretical  capacity  (60 0–10 0 0  mAh/g)  [465–468] .  In
this context, metal oxide-encapsulated GO also showed high bat-
tery properties.

By using GO as a template, Kim et al. [469] synthesized self-
assembled ZnO nanoaggregates exhibiting very good electrochemi-
cal performance. With the reduction of GO, the ZnO-based nanohy-
brids  showed  a  high  discharge  capacity  (752.8  mAh/g)  after  65
charge/discharge cycles. The rGO-based electrode also displayed a
capacity of 400 mAh/g, even when subjected to a current density
of 2 A/g. According to the authors, the hierarchical self-assembled
structure is the main reason for the tremendous electrochemical
performance.

A ZnO/graphene hybrid working at a voltage below 1.0 V was
synthesized by Feng et al. using a hydrothermal process [470] . The
hybrid anode displayed a high delithiation capacity of 749.2 mAh/g
after 100 cycles. For the construction of a Li full cell, it is necessary
to have a suitable anode material which should work at low volt-
age in order to maintain a voltage gap between anode and cathode.
To investigate the working potential of the anode, the specific re-
versible capacities were obtained at different cut-off voltages from
0.01  to  3.0 V.  The  anode  material  exhibited  a  better  capacity  of
240 mAh/g at cut-off voltages in the 0.01–1.0 V range. The lithia-
tion/ delithiation process was followed by the conversion reaction
of ZnO ( Eqs. (1) and (2) ), which was confirmed from the CV within
the voltage rage of 0.01–0.3 V.

It  is  important  to  notice  that  the  structure  of  the  hybrid  re-
mained intact after 100 cycles, which was confirmed by SEM im-
ages  taken  after  cycling.  The  reversible capacity  was  further  en-
hanced by attaching ZnO nanocrystals to the graphene nanosheets
[471] . Through synergistic contributions from each component, the
composite anode exhibited an enhanced capacity of 850 mAh/g at
0.1 C, good rate capability (60% capacity retention at 5 C), and long
cycle  life  (92%  retention  after  50  cycles).  The  enhanced  electro-
chemical properties were attributed to the presence of sites for Li
attachment in both ZnO and graphene. Li accommodation in the
electroactive  sites  of  the  graphene  framework  was  expressed  as
follows ( Eq. (3) ):
+ + C + x e

− ↔ L i x C

The well-secluded ZnO crystals were acting not only as spacers
to support the graphene framework, but also supplied active redox
sites, enhancing the electrochemical processes.

Among  the  transition  metals,  Co

4  has  been  targeted  as
a  potential  candidate  for  LIBs  for  its  high  theoretical  capacity
(890  mAh/g).  Along  with  graphene,  this  transition  metal  oxide
has  the  capability  to  prevent  fast  capacity  fading  and  chemical
degradation. Sun et al. [472] synthesized a Co
4 -graphene core-
shell composite by a solvothermal method. This graphene-wrapped
composite  revealed  enhanced  electrochemical  performance  with
a  wide  potential  range  of  0.01–3 V.  With  high  surface  area  and
4  and graphene, the hybrid
synergistic interactions between Co
electrode  achieved  high  discharge  and  charge  capacities  of  1609
and 1115 mAh/g, respectively. The low CE for the initial cycle was
caused by the formation of SEI, which is one of the common prob-
4 -based
lems in LIBs. With 23.8 wt.% of graphene loading, the Co
nanohybrid  maintained  a  high  reversible  capacity  of  600  mAh/g

up to 500 cycles. In a recent study, Wang et al. [473] reported a
self-supporting  Co
4 /graphene  film  which  demonstrated  a  high
reversible capacity of 1287.7 mAh/g at a current density of 0.2 A/g,
good  cycling  stability  (capacity  retention  of  85.5%  after  100  cy-
cles), and better rate capability (800 mAh/g at 1 A/g). The binder-
free anode material exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of
1718.5  mAh/g  with  CE  of  74.9%.  The  very  good  electrochemical
characteristics  of  the  film  were  explained  by  the  porous  struc-
ture and interfacial interaction between graphene and the metal
oxide. In another study, the Co
4 /graphene electrodes exhibited
3 O
a  high  first  cycle  discharge  capacity  of  2179  mAh/g  ( Fig.  38 ).
The researchers claim that the graphene-anchored Co
4 showed
3 O
higher capacity than the combined theoretical capacity of Co
4
and  graphite  due  to  the  larger  electrochemical  surface  area  of
graphene. Additionally, when compared to Co
4 alone, the hybrid
composite showed better rate capability (935 mAh/g after 30 cy-
cles) due to the availability of additional accessible sites for Li-ion
diffusion [474] .

Due  to  its  high  natural  abundance,  environment-friendly
nature,  and  high  theoretical  capacity  (925  mAh/g),  Fe
3 O
4
has  been  tested  as  a  candidate  for  LIB  anodes.  The  core-
4 /graphene  hybrid  exhibited  a  high
shell  structured  Fe
reversible  capacity  of  1480  mAh/g  at  0.1  A/g  current  density
[475] . Even at the high current rate of 20 A/g, the anode material
showed  a  moderate  capacity  of  184 mAh/g.  The  cycling  stability
was  also  improved  by  the  addition  of  rGO,  which  restricted  the
damage  to  the  metal  oxide  structure  during  continuous  cycling.
By  shortening  the  solid-state  diffusion  path  of  Li-ions,  the  elec-
trode  also  achieved  a  better  energy  density  of  2.91 kWh/kg  at
a  power  density  of  0.170 kW/kg.  To  improve  the  electrochemi-
cal  performance  of  Fe
4 -based  hybrids  at  high  current  rates,
4 /graphene  aerogel  through  a
3 O
Suo  et  al.  [476]  synthesized  Fe
hydrothermally-assisted  freeze  drying  process.  The  3D  aerogel
exhibited a high reversible capacity of 941.5 mAh/g at a very high
current  rate  of  100 mA/g.  The  composite  also  displayed  a  high
discharge  capacity  of  1624.9  mAh/g  and  a  moderate  capacity  of
848.7 mAh/g after 100 cycles. Even at the current density of 2 A/g,
a  capacity  of  223.9  mAh/g  could  be  reached  due  to  synergistic
contributions from the metal oxide and graphene.

Another form of iron oxide, Fe

3 , has been widely used for
construction  of  LiB  anodes  due  to  its  high  theoretical  capacity
(1415 mAh/g). Once again, the capacity retention and cycling sta-
bility  of  this  metal  oxide  were  improved  by  the  combination
with graphene. Xue et al. [477] reported a reversible capacity of
771 mAh/g at the C/10 rate for the nanocomposite based on α-
3 and graphene. The composite electrode retained 73% of the
Fe
original capacity after 30 cycles, however, the initial capacity was
actually lower than for pure α-Fe
3 . The authors have attributed
this peculiar result to incomplete conversion reactions caused by
SEI  layer  formation.  The  intercalation/deintercalation  of  Li  took
place by the following reactions Eqs. (4) and (5) :
F e 2 O 3 + 2L i

− → L i 2 ( F e 2 O 3 )

The  battery  performance  was  clearly  influenced  by  the  pres-
ence of graphene nanosheets, which acted as an elastic buffer to
withstand the volume expansion/contraction of Fe
3  during cy-
cling, acting also as a conductive channel between metal oxide and
collector.  Other  studies  also  concluded  that  the  incorporation  of
3 .
graphene drastically enhanced the cycling performance of Fe
In particular, the α-Fe
3 anchored graphene aerogel exhibited an
initial discharge capacity of 1495.2 mAh/g, which was lower than
that  of  α-Fe
3  achieved  only
72.2  mAh/g  after  100  cycles,  whereas  the  graphene-based  elec-
trode exhibited a capacity of 572. 2 mAh/g. Even at a high current

density of 2 A/g, the graphene-based aerogel achieved a better ca-
pacity (187.1 mAh/g). With an impedance study, the authors con-
firmed the high conductivity and low charge transfer resistance of
the aerogel. Additionally, high surface area (215.1 m 2 /g) and high
pore  volume  also  played  important  roles  in  the  electrochemical
properties.  In  another  study,  Wang  et  al.  [479]  reported  synthe-
sis of few-layer graphene-wrapped Fe
3 by dielectric barrier dis-
charge plasma (DBDP)-assisted ball milling (denoted as P-milling).
The  graphene wrapped-Fe
4  composites  exhibited  an  enhanced
reversible  capacity  of  758  mAh/g  at  200 mA/g  after  300  cycles
( Fig. 39 ). By increasing the number of graphene layers, the elec-
trochemical  performance  was  enhanced  due  to  increases  in  sur-
face  area  and  pore  volume,  as  well  as  the  homogeneous  wrap-
ping of the oxide. Fig. 39 d shows the Nyquist plots for bare Fe

and  different  graphene  wrapped-Fe
4  composite  samples  with
milling periods of 5 h, 10 h and 20 h (denoted as P5, P10 and P20).
Smaller semicircle diameters present in Nyquist plots of the com-
posite  samples  indicate  lower  contact  and  charge-transfer  resis-
tances  when  compared  to  those  of  bare  Fe
3  electrode,  which
was due to the introduction of graphitic carbon. With milling times
increasing from 5 h to 20 h, the resistance steadily decreased. The
good conductivity of P20 should be attributed to the tight wrap-
3 O
ping of few-layer graphene on Fe
Besides  these  metal  oxides,  a  few  other  oxides  were  also
used  along  with  graphene  as  anodes  for  LIBs.  For  example,
Xing  et  al.  [480]  reported  the  better  battery  performance  of  α-
2 /graphene nanosheets synthesized by a wet-chemical route.
MnO
Within a wide potential range of 0.01–3 V, the composite anode
exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1235 mAh/g. The elec-
trode also showed a moderate reversible capacity of 726.5 mAh/g,
which was maintained at 635.5mAh/g after 30 cycles. The lithia-
tion process of this metal oxide occurred by the following reaction
( Eq. (6) ):

Even  though,  when  compared  to  other  metal  oxides,  MnO
based composites displayed a low capacity, a coulombic efficiency

of  99%  was  kept  after  20  cycles.  This  enhanced  electrochemical
performance was caused by the flexible nature of graphene, which
controlled the volume expansion/contraction during cycling. Ow-
ing  to  its  relatively  high  theoretical  capacity  (782  mAh/g),  SnO
2
was investigated as LIB anode. Prepared by one-step solution-based
process, SnO
2 /graphene composites exhibited a reversible capacity
of 690 mAh/g [481] . In addition, 63% of the reversible capacity was
retained after 20 cycles for the composite anode, which is much
higher than commercial SnO

All solid-state planar integrated lithium ion micro-batteries as
well as lithium ion micro-capacitors have been designed for high
performance  energy  storage  applications  [4 82,4 83] .  Zheng  et  al.
[482] investigated all-solid-state high temperature performing flex-
ible planar lithium ion micro-batteries. The batteries exhibited vol-
umetric energy density of 125.5 mWh/cm 3 , long-term cycling sta-
bility at room temperature and high rate capability due to multi-
directional Li-ion diffusion mechanism. They show good flexibility,
even under repeated bending under high-temperature (100 °C) for
10 0 0 cycles and superior miniaturization. In another study, Zheng
et  al.  [483]  reported  fabrication  of  all-solid-state  flexible  planar
lithium ion micro-capacitors. The prototype capacitors were based
on  interdigitated  patterns  of  lithium  titanate  nanospheres  (an-
ode) and activated graphene (cathode). The micro-capacitors were
fabricated via layer-by-layer mask-assisted deposition of graphene
and  electrode  materials.  The  planar  lithium  ion  micro-capacitors
yielded  high  volumetric  energy  density  (53.5  mWh/cm 3 ),  high
temperature stability (80 °C) and good mechanical flexibility, be-
ing also highly safe.

5.1.2. Graphene/Go with mixed metal oxides

For  further  improvement  in  electrochemical  performance,  in-
cluding high capacity and long cycle life, some researchers have
studied anode materials based on mixed metal oxides (MMOs) and
graphene. Low cost, single-phase ternary metal oxides with differ-
ent metal cathodes generally exhibited 2–3 times higher capacity
than carbon-based materials due to the multiple valences of the
cations.

The Li

12 spinel (LTO) was considered as an efficient com-
ponent material for LIB anodes due to its relatively good poten-
tial and Li-ion insertion/extraction reversibility. The specific capac-
ity of LTO was found to be low due to poor electrical conductivity
and low Li diffusion coefficient; nonetheless, it exhibited impres-
sive  cycling  stability  due  to  the  minimal  volume  change  during
the charge/discharge process. Liu et al. [484] reported the sol-gel
synthesis of LTO/graphene composites which exhibited a capacity
of 170.7 mAh/g at 1 C. The specific capacity was lower than the
ones for conventional metal oxide-based composites, but the elec-
trode  retained  ∼99%  of  the  specific  capacity  after  100  cycles.  In
another similar study [485] , LTO/rGO exhibited a capacity of only
131.6 mAh/g, but no capacity fading was observed up to 500 cycles.
On the other hand, the rate capability was quite impressive, be-
ing higher than the one for pristine LTO. With a minimal graphene
loading (3 wt.%), the nanohybrids exhibited long cycle lifes because
of the easier transport of Li + ions.

Metal  ferrites  with  spinel  structure  are  considered  better  LIB
materials for anodes due to their high theoretical capacity and rel-
atively  good  potential.  Among  them,  CoFe
4  (CFO)  is  the  most
widely  investigated  material  for  battery  anodes,  since  it  has  the
ability to store eight Li-ions per formula unit and also have a high
theoretical capacity of 916 mAh/g. Structured composites having a
3D CFO/graphene network exhibited a high reversible capacity (up
to 937.73 mAh/g) at a high current density of 1 A/g [486] . As con-
cluded from CV curves, the Li insertion/de-insertion process pro-
ceeded by the following reactions ( Eqs. (7)–(10) ):

As expected, the composites exhibited a high initial discharge
capacity of 1684 mAh/g, but the coulombic efficiency was found
to  be  low  (53%)  due  to  SEI  film  formation.  This  anode  material
exhibited a moderate capacity retention of 69.5% after 50 cycles,
which  is  lower  than  the  one  for  LTO-based  composites.  The  re-
versible  capacity  and  the  cycling  stability  of  CFO/graphene  were
found to be higher than CFO alone due to the enhancement in Li
diffusion coefficient. The graphene encapsulating structure played
an important role, allowing fast Li-ion transport across the elec-
trode/electrolyte interface. In addition, the interfacial interactions
between  the  CFO  NPs  and  graphene  also  improved  the  electro-
chemical properties. Xia et al. [487] reported a maximum capacity
of 1082 mAh/g for nanohybrids based on hydrothermally synthe-
sized CFO and graphene. The battery performance of CFO/graphene
nanohybrids was improved by decreasing the particle size of CFO.
Having diameters of less than 10 nm, the hydrothermally synthe-
sized CFO NPs were uniformly distributed on the graphene sheets
and  resulted  in  a  high  surface  area  of  156.7  m 2 /g.  The  elec-
trodes  retained  84%  of  capacity  after  50  cycles  ( Fig.  40 ).  In  or-
der to achieve better electrochemical performance, it is necessary
to anchor these small-sized oxide particles on graphene avoiding
agglomeration.

Other  spinel  ferrites  such  as  CuFe

4  (theoretical  capacity  of
895  mAh/g)  and  MnFe
4  also  exhibited  good  battery  perfor-
mance as anodes. Copper ferrite-based graphene nanohybrids dis-
played good rate capability and robust cycling stability in its spinel

(CuFe

combination exhibited a reversible rate capability of 587 mAh/g af-
4 /rGO showed a capac-
ter 100 cycles at 200 mA/g, whereas CuFe
ity of 1102 mAh/g after 250 cycles at 800 mA/g [488] . Even at the
very high current density of 3.2 A/g, CuFe
4 /rGO still remained
with a high capacity of 560 mAh/g ( Fig. 41 ). Notably, compared to
4 /rGO anode achieved a higher rate capabil-
the CFO, the Cu/CuFe
ity, which was explained by the higher surface area (161.39 m 2 /g)
and the synergistic effects of both graphene and small crystals of
4 . From the structural aspect also, it is clear that the de-
CuFe
position of sheet-like CuFe
4  on graphene sheets enhanced the
number  of  electrochemical  reaction  sites,  which  was  beneficial
for the lithiation/delithiation process. The contribution of smaller
crystals of highly conductive Cu could not be neglected, increas-
ing the electrochemical reaction sites and accommodating the vol-
ume changes during cycling. Another mixed metal ferrite/graphene
4 -based, displayed a high capacity of
nanosheet composite, MnFe
1017 mAh/g after 90 cycles at the current density of 0.1 mA/g [489] .
Like CFO, it also followed similar redox reactions and turned into
a mixture of MnO and Fe
4 during charge-discharge testing. The
composite electrode exhibited a high reversible capacity of more
than 103% after 90 cycles, as compared to the first cycle. The cubic-
shaped MnFe
4 well dispersed on graphene prevented the forma-
tion of large clusters and agglomeration. Additionally, the presence
of graphene sheets restricted the structural breakdown and crack
formation  by  providing  extra  space  for  volume  changes  during
cycling.

5.1.3. Graphene/GO with metal sulfides/mixed metal sulfides

Transition metal sulphides are considered good candidates for
battery anodes due to their high capacity, enhanced electrical con-
ductivity and high safety. Layered transition metal dichalcogenides
synthesized by a molecular self-promoting process through thioac-
etamide  exhibited  very  good  electrochemical  performance  when
combined with graphene [490] . Better rate capability, high lifespan,
and enhanced specific capacity have been displayed by VS
4  nan-
2 nanoribbon/graphene. Because of the
ocluster/graphene and MoS
presence of expanded and exfoliated interlayers, the VS
4 /graphene
electrodes  delivered  a  high  reversible  capacity  of  950  mAh/g  at
200 mA/g. Additionally, it also exhibited a capacity of 300 mAh/g
at a very high current density of 10 A/g and maintained a capac-
ity of 965 mAh/g for 120 cycles ( Fig. 42 ). Owing to its high sur-
face area (143.6 m 2 /g), MoS
2 /graphene displayed a high capacity
of 900 mAh/g at 200 mA/g, which was decreased to 232 mAh/g at
a very high current density of 10 A/g. This 3D electrode also ex-
hibited a high capacity of 1100 mAh/g after 150 cycles. The signif-
icantly high electrochemical properties of these layered sulphide-
based composites were attributed to their porous structure, bene-
ficial for enhanced Li storage and easy Li-ion transport; low charge
transfer resistance and high Li diffusion coefficient.

In  a  recent  study,  Han  et  al.  [491]  reported  the  improved
LIB  performance  for  cobalt–manganese  mixed-sulfide  (CoMn-S)
nanocages encapsulated by rGO. Benefitting from the hollow and

after 400 cycles. The authors also demonstrated good rate capabil-
ity for this mixed metal sulphide-based anode.

5.1.4. Doped graphene/GO with metal oxides/mixed metal oxides

Electrodes  based  on  hetero-atom  doped  graphene/metal  ox-
ides  were  also  investigated  for  LIBs.  With  tuned  electronic  fea-
tures,  the  doped  graphene  improved  the  electrochemical  per-
formances  of  the  hybrid  composites.  A  sandwich-structured
4  composite  exhibited  a  high  capacity  of
N-doped  graphene/Fe
∼1227 mAh/g and high cycling stability (96.8% capacity retention

over 10 0 0 cycles) [492] . The anode material yielded very high dis-
charge capacity for the first cycle (1659 mAh/g); this capacity value
is  much  higher  than  the  one  for  the  undoped  graphene/Fe

4
composite.  Yang  et  al.  [493]  evaluated  Fe
4  encapsulated  into
N,  S  co-doped  graphene  sheets  through  hydrothermal  treatment
and  carbonization  processes.  The  co-doped  electrodes  exhibited
a  high  reversible  capacity  of  1055  mAh/g,  which  was  attributed
to  the  meso/micro  pores  facilitating  Li-ion  and  electrolyte  diffu-
sion. The high conductivity also enabled the anode to achieve a
high capacity of 557 mAh/g, even at the high current density of
1 A/g.

Owing to the synergistic contribution from each metal compo-
nent, mixed transition metal oxides demonstrated better electro-
chemical performance in combination with doped graphene. In a
recent study, Sahoo et al. [494] reported a high specific capacity
of 998 mAh/g at 100 mA/g after 30 charge/discharge cycles for a
mesoporous nanohybrid based on ZnCo
4 and N-doped graphene
4  par-
( Fig. 43 ). The uniform dispersion of wormhole-like ZnCo
ticles on doped graphene sheets formed a highly conductive net-
work,  enabling  the  doped  nanohybrids  to  display  better  battery
performance than their undoped counterparts.

Wang et al. demonstrated an extremely high initial discharge
4 and
capacity of 2479 mAh/g at a high rate of 300 mA/g for ZnFe
N, S co-doped graphene [495] . Through strong electrostatic inter-
action, ZnFe
4  hollow spheres were uniformly deposited on co-
doped graphene sheets and enabled the anode material to achieve
a high surface area of 102 m 2 /g. Due to the formation of a 3D flexi-
ble porous network, the anode material exhibited a high reversible
capacity of 729 mAh/g after 100 cycles, with high coulombic effi-
ciency (99.4%). The enhanced electrochemical performance of the
doped composites was explained by the creation of defects on the
graphene sheets through N-doping and the improvement of chem-
ical activity through polarization due to the presence of lone pairs
of S.

5.1.5. Doped graphene/GO with metal sulphides

Researchers  also  explored  the  battery  performance  of  hybrid
composites based on metal sulphides and doped graphene. Mah-
mood et al. [496] developed a one-pot hydrothermal synthetic ap-
proach  to  grow  phase-controlled  Ni
1.03  on  N-doped
graphene  sheets.  The  anode  material  exhibited  a  high  discharge
capacity  of  1660  mAh/g  for  the  first  cycle.  This  capacity  de-
creased to 1338 mAh/g for the second cycle due to SEI formation
( Fig. 44 ), but for the subsequent 100 cycles, steady capacity reten-
tion was achieved. Like other doped anode materials, the defects
in graphene played an important role in the smooth Li + ion inter-
calation/ deintercalation processes. Even at high current rates, the

4 -based composites exhibited high cycling performance. Once
again, the rate capability and reversible capacity of the doped elec-
trode was found to be higher than its undoped counterpart. The
authors  also  observed  that  an  annealing  process  effectively  con-
verted NiS

4 , further enhancing battery performance.

5.1.6. Functionalized graphene/GO with metal oxides

Graphene functionalization has a great impact on the battery
performance of hybrid composites because of the improved elec-
tronic structure and enhanced conductive nature. In this context,
2  exhibited  significantly  higher  electro-
sulfonated  graphene/SnO
chemical performance when compared to the non-functionalized
graphene-based anodes [497] . The sulfonated electrode displayed
a  reversible  specific  capacity  of  928.5  mAh/g  at  a  current  den-
sity of 200 mA/g, with a capacity of 680 mAh/g at 400 mA/g be-
ing retained after 120 cycles. The conductive framework of func-
tionalized  graphene  offered  suitable  electron  transfer  pathways
by reducing the charge transfer resistance. In another study, Lee
et al. reported nanohole-induced iron oxide-decorated and gelatin-
functionalized  graphene  hybrid  structure,  which  delivered  a  re-
versible capacity of 924 mAh/g even after 40 charge/discharge cy-
cles  ( Fig.  45 )  [498] .  The  nanoholes  enhanced  the  rate  of  Li-ion
transport and the gelatin functionalization made the graphene film
more compact and thinner. Due to the 3D interconnected structure
and the N-doped graphene, the anode material displayed high rate
capability, stable cycling performance and enhanced coulombic ef-
ficiency.

5.1.7. Graphene/GO based ternary nanocomposites

Ternary  nanohybrids  including  graphene  exhibited  enhanced
LIB performance through individual contributions from each com-
ponent.  In  a  recent  work,  Gangaraju  et  al.  [499]  reported  LIB
properties  of  a  ternary  composite  based  on  graphene,  N-doped
CNTs,  and  Mn
4 .  As  a  3D  anode  material,  the  composite  dis-
played a  high initial discharge capacity  of 1394.6 mAh/g.  Owing
to the presence of graphene and defective CNTs, the 3D electrode

exhibited a high surface area of 688 m 2 /g. Taking advantage from
a unique combination of metal oxide moieties, carbon structures
and N-doped moieties, the anode material retained a capacity of
1337 mAh/g after 300 cycles. Zhao et al. [500] reported a simple
hydrothermal-assisted synthetic  strategy  to  prepare ternary  free-
standing composite paper electrodes based on CoSnO
3 , graphene
and  CNTs.  The  ternary  electrode  exhibited  a  high  discharge  ca-
pacity of 1830.1 mAh/g and retained 78.8% of the initial capacity
after 150 charge/discharge cycles. Searching for high cycling sta-
bility, Li et al. [501] synthesized a sandwich-type electrode based
on graphene, Fe
4 quantum dots and amorphous carbon. In this
work, the authors developed a crosslinking-induced spontaneous
growth  process  to  prepare  small-sized  Fe
4  particles  from  an
organometallic compound ferrocene in the presence of graphene
and amorphous carbon. The electrode achieved a reversible capac-
ity of 1241 mAh/g, which was reduced to 1055 mAh/g after 200 cy-
cles. Owing to its high surface area (260 m 2 /g), the ternary elec-
trode also displayed a high rate-capability ( Fig. 46 ). The improved
cycling stability was achieved by minimizing the Li-ion transport
path length by using ultra-small Fe

5.1.8. Graphene/Si nanocomposites

Silicon could be a potential anode material for LIBs, but Si suf-
fers from low conductivity and poor cycling stability due to a large
volume  expansion.  In  order  to  overcome  these  problems,  Si  has
been combined with conductive graphene to build efficient hybrid
composite anode materials. Over the past few years, Si nanoparti-

cle coated graphene materials have been extensively investigated
for  LIBs  [502–507] .  For  example,  carbon-coated  Si  nanoparticles
were  deposited  on  graphene  to  form  a  hybrid  anode  material,
which achieved a high capacity of 1410 mAh/g after 100 cycles, in-
dicating better cycling stability [507] . Moreover, Li et al. fabricated
hybrid LIB anodes through the growth of conformal graphene cages
on Si micro-particles [508] . In this hybrid electrode, the graphene
cages acted as a flexible, strong buffer to restrict the volume ex-
pansion during cycling, while maintaining high conductivity. As a
result, the full cell based on this electrode retained 90% of its ini-
tial capacity after 100 cycles. This unconventional approach opened
a new door for utilization of these types of hybrid anode materials
in LIBs. For further enhancement of electrochemical performance,
Si  NPs  have  been  deposited  on  S-doped  graphene  [509] .  Owing
to  the  strong  covalent  interaction  between  the  key  components,
this hierarchical anode material displayed an elevated capacity of
> 10 0 0 mAh/g for 2275 cycles. Recently, Zhou et al. [510] fabricated
a sandwich-type LIB anode based on graphene, Si, and nanocellu-
lose which exhibited a reversible capacity of 1251 mAh/g at a high
current density of 100 mA/g after 100 cycles. In this work, the au-
thors fabricated a flexible full cell battery with this ternary sand-
wich anode and a lithium cobalt oxide cathode, which was able
to light up a LED even when bent or folded. In another work, a
3D porous GO network was used as the binder for Si-based an-
ode material [511] . In this case, GO not only restricted the volume
changes during cycling, but also stabilized the electrode. Benefited
by this dual role of GO, the hybrid anode displayed a capacity of

20 0 0 mAh/g after 100 cycles through the formation of stable SEI.
This Si/graphene aerogel demonstrated excellent capacity retention
of 104% after 195 cycles [512] . On the other hand, an hybrid com-
posite anode based on Si and N-doped graphene displayed only a
moderate capacity retention of 77.8% after 100 cycles [513] . Current
research  directions  have  been  shifted  towards  the  fabrication  of
effective Si/graphene hybrid anode materials through facile, cost-
effective synthetic routes [514–518] . A detailed survey of different
kinds of graphene/GO based anode materials synthesized by differ-
ent approaches and their electrochemical performances have been
summarized in Table 7 .

5.2. Graphene-based materials as cathodes for LIBs

Although graphene/modified graphene has been considered as
a suitable candidate for the fabrication of LIB anodes, it has not
been frequently adopted as cathode material. However, in the past
few years researchers have been investigating the use of graphene
for the construction of LIB cathodes [568,569] . Graphene has been
considered as an efficient cathode material for LIBs due to the fol-
lowing advantages.

1. Due to the relatively low melting temperature of LIB cath-
odes,  the  carbon  additives  should  have  high  electronic
conductivities. Graphene possesses better conductivity than
carbon  additives  like  carbon  black  because  of  its  high
surface/mass  ratio  and  well-organized  sp 2  bonded  carbon

atoms. Therefore, it promotes electron flow at elevated cur-
rent  densities.  Because  of  the  superior  conductive  nature,
graphene has been vigorously used as electronically conduc-
tive carbon additive for LiB cathodes.

2. The high surface area of graphene (theoretical surface area
of  2630  m 2 /g)  facilitates  the  easy  transport  of  electrolyte
ions.

3. The  formation  of  3D  conductive  network  structures  after
proper mixing of graphene with metals/metal oxides/mixed
metal  oxides  enhances  the  rate  capability  and  stability  of
high power LIBs.

4. The presence of functional groups in chemically converted
graphene/rGO  enhances  the  interaction  and  bonding  be-
tween the metal and graphene, which improves the cycling
stability of LIBs. Moreover, the introduction of structural de-
fects on the graphene surface enhances the catalytic proper-
ties and thus improves the LIB performance.

5. The high surface area of graphene allows it to act as a sub-
strate  for  growth  of  metal  oxide/mixed  metal  oxides  with
improved rate performance. In such case, the intimate con-
tact between the substrate and active cathode material gen-
erates a smooth pathway for electron-flow, thus enhancing
the rate capability.

6. The  composites  of  graphene  with  other  carbon  materials
exhibited  better  LIB  performance  through  synergistic  ef-
fects,  accelerating  the  electron  transfer  rate  and  Li + -ion
diffusivity.

7. As an ideal LIB cathode material, graphene has a wide and
stable  electrochemical  potential  window.  Moreover,  it  has
high intrinsic carrier mobility, elevated thermal conductivity,
and excellent mechanical strength for LiB cathodes.

4 has
been  established  as  a  LIB  cathode  material  with  high-rate  ca-
pability  as  well  as  cycling  stability  [570–578] .  In  this  section,
we have summarized a few recent studies on the application of
graphene/graphene-based materials as cathodes for LIBs. N-doped
graphene  was  effectively  utilized  as  a  suitable  cathode  material
through its enhanced Li + ion absorbing capability due to the pres-
ence of pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N. The N-doped graphene boosts
the  conductivity,  improving  also  the  wettability  of  graphene  by
the electrolytes [579] . A drastic enhancement in the cycling sta-
bility  was  achieved  by  doping  the  graphene  nanosheets.  Using
urea as both N-source and reducing agent, hydrothermally synthe-
sized N-doped graphene exhibited a constant reversible capacity of
146 mAh/g after 10 0 0 charge/discharge cycles [580] . The authors
also observed nearly 100% coulombic efficiency for several cycles,
which  is  highly  beneficial  for  the  commercial  application  of  the
cathode materials ( Fig. 47 ). Like in the case of doped anode ma-
terials, the N-doped graphene applied to cathodes was able to en-
hance the electrochemical performance through the creation of in-
plane defects. One more interesting finding of this article was that,
by increasing the N-doping level, the gravimetric current density
gradually increased due to the greater density of structural defects.
The oxygen-containing functional groups also played an important
role in enhancing the rate capability and cycling stability. Among
different types of hetero-doped N atoms (pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N,
and graphitic-N), pyrrolic-N enhanced the Li storage capacity to a
larger extent than the other N-containing species.

In a recent study, Kim et al. applied Li-iodine chemistry to fab-
ricate free-standing LIB cathodes based on rGO and LiI [581] . The
free-standing electrodes achieved a capacity of 200 mAh/g at 0.5 C
after 100 cycles ( Fig. 48 ) . From the CV analysis, the authors con-
cluded that the LiI followed a diffusion-controlled redox process
expressed by the reaction in Eq. (11) :

2 LiI ↔ I 2 + 2L i

+ + 2 e
−

(11)

The  rGO/LiI  cathodes  displayed  considerable  capacity  at  high
and low current densities because of the supply of additional elec-
tron pathways by the rGO. Additionally, fast reaction kinetics also
enabled the cathode material to achieve subsequent cycling stabil-
ity.

In a previous study, Ai et al. investigated graphene-based or-
ganic  carbonyl  LIB  cathodes.  The  idea  of  using  electroactive  car-
bonyl compounds was based on their capability to transfer elec-
trons  efficiently  during  the  charge/discharge  processes  [582] .  In
this article, the authors introduced vat dye (a dye generally used
for fabric dying) for the first time as an efficient component for
cathodes. Among a series of vat dyes, vat green 8/graphene com-
posite displayed better cycling performance because of the forma-
tion of a stable structure through π - π interactions. The cathode
materials achieved a capacity of 74 mAh/g at a high current rate
of 3.2 A/g, which was found to be higher than for other organic
cathodes.

Metal  oxide-based  cathodes  also  exhibited  enhanced  electro-
chemical  properties.  Özcan  et  al.  [583]  compared  the  electro-
chemical  performances  of  composites  based  on  three  different
2  ( −α,  −β,  and  −γ )  and  graphene.  Among
polymorphs  of  MnO
these  freestanding  cathode  materials,  α-MnO
2  based  compos-
ites  displayed  the  highest  initial  specific  capacity  of  321  mAh/g
and  also  retained  72%  of  capacity  after  200  cycles  due  to  the

enhancement  in  electrical  conductivity.  The  capacity  fading  of
urchin-like γ -MnO
2 microspheres was restricted by the wrapping
of graphene sheets during the cycling stability tests.

Transition metal sulphides were also considered as candidates
for the fabrication of LIB cathodes. As an example, graphene foam-
supported FeS
2  displayed a capacity of 625 mAh/g at 0.25 C and
a capacity retention of 79% after 100 cycles [584] . The enhanced
electrochemical  performance  was  attributed  to  the  high  specific
surface area, the formation of a conductive network and the high
porosity.

Recently, researchers have focused on the utilization of organic-
inorganic  composites  as  cathodes  for  LIBs.  In  this  context,  He
et  al.  [585]  synthesized  rGO/Fe-phthalocyanine  composite  by  a
solvothermal-assisted  annealing  process,  which  delivered  a  dis-
charge capacity of 186 mAh/g after 100 cycles at the current den-
sity of 300 mA/g. The Fe-based nanospheres were uniformly dis-
tributed over the graphene sheets, not only acting as spacers to
prevent the restacking of graphene sheets, but also enhancing the
specific surface area. The hybrid composite benefited from the high
conductivity of rGO, achieving much higher capacity than the in-
dividual  Fe-phthalocyanine.  Moreover,  the  hybrid  composite  dis-

played a discharge capacity of 441 mAh/g at 50 mA/g current den-
sity,  decreasing  to  186  mAh/g  at  the  current  rate  of  500 mA/g
( Fig. 49 ). The stable conductive structure of the cathode material
was responsible for the high rate capability and long-term cycling
stability.

In  a  recent  study,  Benítez  et  al.  developed  a  full  LIB  cell  us-
ing graphene-sulfur cathodes and silicon oxide anodes [586] . The
3D  graphene-based  cathode  achieved  a  capacity  of  10 0 0  mAh/g
at  1  C,  while  tested  in  half  cell.  The  full  cell  also  exhib-
ited  a  promising  capacity  value  of  460  mAh/g  after  200  cy-
cles  ( Fig.  50 ).  Considering  the  cell  voltage  and  capacity,  the  au-
thors assumed that the energy density of the full cell should ex-
ceed  200 Wh/kg.  With  respect  to  the  commonly  used  graphene-
based  LIB  cathodes,  this  3D  functionalized  graphene  cathode  is
very promising in terms of cost-effectiveness and electrochemical
performance.

With rapid progress in battery development, Li-S batteries have
attracted  researchers due to  their high gravimetric capacity, ele-
vated theoretical energy density, and utilization of non-toxic mate-
rials.  For  further  improvement of  battery  performance,  graphene
has  been  used  as  an  efficient  scaffold  for  the  S  cathode.  Its

introduction enhances the conductivity, limits volume change dur-
ing cycling, and restricts the diffusion of polysulfides into the elec-
trolyte. Wang et al. [587] first fabricated these graphene/S cath-
ode materials by a direct mixing and melting process. Even though
the  battery  performance  was  not  very  impressive,  it  opened  a
new door for the researchers to fabricate high-performance cath-
ode materials. Since then, extensive investigations have been car-
ried out with on graphene-based S cathodes [588–593] . Recently,
an S-containing copolymer was combined with graphene by heat-
ing elemental S and isopropenylphenyl-functionalized rGO to fab-
ricate  an  efficient  cathode  material  for  Li-S  batteries.  This  cath-
ode allowed better rate capability (688 mAh/g at 1C) than elemen-
tal S electrodes (400 mAh/g at 1C). The electrode also displayed
high retention (of 89.6% of the initial values) after 500 cycles at
1C. The authors claimed that the addition of graphene overcame
the problematic “shuttle effect” of polysulfide intermediates [594] .
Yeon et al. [595] fabricated a high-performance cathode material
by depositing rod-like nano-sulfur on rGO microspheres. The cath-
ode achieved a high initial capacity of 1269.1 mAh/g and minimal
capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle over 500 cycles. The enhanced
battery  performance  was  attributed  to  its  porous  structure  and
strong interaction between the nano-sulfur and porous graphene.
In another study, a freestanding rGO/S aerogel demonstrated a high
capacity of 3.4 mAh/cm 2 and 85% capacity retention after 350 cy-
cles in fluorine-free catholyte [596] . A graphene/CNT aerogel with
high Sulfur content has also been proposed for cathodes [597] . This
special type of cathode material displayed a reversible capacity of
> 500 mAh/g after 500 cycles. Flexible, paper-type and binder-free
cathodes were fabricated by integrating sulfur with graphene and
a conductive carbon material [598] . The free-standing cathodes ex-
hibited a capacity of 1386 mAh/g and retained 68% of its initial ca-
pacity after 400 cycles. Different kinds of graphene/GO based cath-
ode materials synthesized by various approaches and their electro-
chemical performance have been summarized in Table 8 .

8. Conclusions and future prospects

In summary, we have outlined the synthesis of graphene (in-
cluding  its  derivatives)  targeted  at  energy  storage  applications.
Metal oxide/sulfide attachment on their surfaces improves the per-
formance of active materials which have been used as anodes and
cathodes for LIBs. The large specific surface area and porosity of
graphene and its derivatives (GO/rGO) improve the accessibility of
electrolyte ions in active materials to promote the charge storage
capability and energy density. The outstanding electrical conductiv-
ity of graphene enables the charge transport from/to the interfaced
active materials to enhance the rate capability and power density.

(i). Synthesis of graphene and its derivatives

Many synthesis effort s have been devoted to expanding the fun-
damental understanding of the processes taking place during for-
mation of graphene.

(a) In the chemical exfoliation of graphite to obtain graphene,
various solvents/ chemicals and intercalates have been used
to weaken the Van der Waals forces for easier formation of
graphene sheets.

(b) In order to grow epitaxial graphene on SiC substrates, sev-
eral approaches are being tested. Thermal decomposition of
SiC  at  high  temperature  in  UHV  produces  mono  to  few-
layers graphene. The sublimation of Si from SiC substrates
leaves a carbon-rich face, forming layers of graphene on the
substrate surface.

(c) Besides  chemical  exfoliation  and  epitaxial  graphene  for-
mation  in  UHV,  numerous  alternative  methods  have  been

developed  to  grown  mono-,  bi-  and  few-layer  graphene
layers  by  CVD.  Different  variations  of  the  CVD  technique
have  been  reported  for  the  growth  of  graphene,  including
manipulation of synthesis parameters such as temperature,
pressure, growth atmosphere, carbon source etc.

(d) There  are  still,  however,  many  challenges  to  be  met  be-
fore the strict control over the number of graphene layers
and device fabrication are easily and reproducibly achieved.
Laser  assisted  processing  nearly  overcame  these  problems,
especially  in  the  case  of  direct  graphene  micro-patterning
for application devices. Laser processing for graphene syn-
thesis  yields  fewer  impurities  (in  comparison  to  chemical
exfoliation and epitaxial growth), including many advantages
like the simplicity of the approach, rapid patterning and lo-
calized energy delivery, better control over the number of
graphene layers and direct device fabrication. Several laser
processing approaches such as laser-assisted CVD, PLD/ laser
ablation, laser irradiation, direct laser writing, laser exfoli-
ation, laser induced epitaxial growth, laser induced plasma
deposition and laser unzipping of CNTs have been reported
for  formation  of  graphene  in  a  short  time  span.  Parame-
ters  such  as  laser  power,  scanning  rate  and  pulse  width
can be varied to achieve the desired quality and number of
graphene layers from various carbon materials.

(ii). Reduction of GO/graphite oxide

The controlled oxidation of graphene/graphite into GO/graphite
oxide and its subsequent modification/reduction into rGO are cru-
cial processes for increasing the applications of graphene and its
derivative materials. Some of the possible applications of graphene
and derivative materials are in electrodes, polymer composites, en-
ergy conversion/storage devices, sensors devices and organic elec-
tronics. The mass production with large specific surface areas of
GO/rGO is necessary for the large scale fabrication of bulk energy
storage devices. Several reduction approaches have been proposed
for  the  controlled  removal  of  oxygen-containing  surface  groups
for reduction of GO/graphite oxide to rGO. Chemical, thermal, mi-
crowave and laser methods are the most widely used approaches.

(a) The reducing chemicals react with the oxygen functionali-
ties on the surfaces and edges of GO, decreasing their con-
centration. Generally, the chemical reduction can be realized
at room temperature but sometimes needs moderate heat-
ing  to  accelerate  the  reactions  as  well  as  for  achieving  a
higher degree of reduction. Cheap, effective chemical treat-
ment methods have been developed, but they involve dan-
gerous, harmful reducing agents and are not strictly appro-
priate for mass reduction of GO.

(b) The thermal reduction of GO can be perform by rapid heat
treatment in inert or slightly reducing atmospheres. Thermal
reduction by rapid heating is very popular because it also
exfoliates  GO/graphite  oxide  and  the  reduction  also  favors
the formation of porous structures. The thermal reduction of
GO by rapid heating is a good strategy to yield bulk quantity
rGO materials. However, the thermal reduction method gen-
erates a wrinkled surface morphology on the rGO surfaces.
Thermal  annealing  can  produce  high  quality  rGO,  but  this
processing route requires high temperatures ( ∼1050 °C) and
this might be incompatible with direct application in devices
involving other materials more susceptible to thermal dam-
age.

(c) The  unconventional  heating  of  GO  through  microwaves
yields  removal  of  oxygen  functionalities  with  exfoliation
into porous structure. Microwave reduction is a simple, fast

45

(reduction  time  < 1 min)  and  cheap  approach  without  the
need for any additional chemicals.

(d) The laser reduction of GO for generation of conducting mi-
cro channels on GO films and laser writing for direct device
processing has attracted a great deal of attention. Laser re-
duction  treatments of  GO  can  yield very  precise and  con-
trolled  reduction  up  to  the  desired  depth  and  width.  The
degree of reduction of GO is highly dependent upon laser
power,  irradiation  time,  scanning  speed  etc.  Laser-reduced
GO regions with micron scale widths as well as spacing are
especially suitable as electrodes for different types of micro-
supercapacitors.

Microwave and laser irradiation methods have, in general, the
potential to yield high quality rGO, while at the same time pro-
viding better exfoliation when compared to chemical and thermal
approaches.

(iii). Application of graphene/GO in LIBs

In  the  last  few  years,  many  research  articles  have  been  pub-
lished on the use of graphene /graphene-based materials as anodes
and cathodes for LIBs. In spite of this vigorous research effort that
produced graphene-based materials with high current capacity as
well as other favorable electrochemical characteristics, many obsta-
cles must still be removed in order to make it viable the large scale
production of graphene LIBs. The key remaining drawbacks are:

(a) The addition of graphene mainly enhanced the surface area
of the anode materials and accelerated the electron trans-
port by shorting the pathway of Li + ions. However, in prac-
tical applications, one of the major issues is the occurrence
of side reactions during battery use. By employing graphene
as a component of the anode materials, the probability of
occurrence for these side reactions increases, since the elec-
trolytes tend to decompose on high surface area carbon ma-
terials.

(b) The functional groups on graphene are also prone to decom-

position, thus lowering the coulombic efficiency.

(c) The  formation  of  SEI  films  on  graphene  surfaces  is  also
one of the major concerns for the practical applications of
graphene.

(d) For the fabrication of cathodes, graphene faces several dis-
advantages, such as low tap density, high volume, SEI for-
mation etc.

(e) It has been proposed that, for constructing an efficient cath-
ode  material,  it  is  feasible  to  add  a  minimal  amount  of
graphene. This strategy also has a few drawbacks in terms
of low Li + mobility.

It is important to notice that, in the near future, for the prac-
tical  use  of  LIBs,  not  only  the  electrode  materials,  but  also  the
electrolytes  need  to  be  optimized.  Appropriate  compatibility  be-
tween electrode and electrolyte is an essential requisite. A trust-
worthy  material  with  proper  structure,  which  will  deliver  im-
proved rate capability and long-term cycling stability through ef-
ficient lithiation/ delithiation processes is highly desirable. In re-
cent years, researchers are also focusing on other 2D materials be-
sides graphene. In this context, newly discovered MXenes (a fam-
ily of 2D transition metal carbides/nitrides) with high conductiv-
ity and large tape density are being considered as suitable battery
2  can also be considered as a good alternative for
materials. MoS
graphene in LIB application because of its high theoretical capacity
(twice that of graphite). In order to sidestep the problems of low Li
abundance and the safety issues, scientists have proposed alterna-
tive rechargeable batteries such as Na-ion and Na-air types. Even
though LIBs played a major role in fulfilling a significant part of

the present energy demands, it is appropriate to finish this review
by stating that more efficient, cheaper, and highly durable batteries
are still needed in order to solve the ever increasing future energy
storage and supply demands.
