The purpose of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive account of Lagrangian stochastic
methods for polydisperse two-phase reactive flows. In this work, the emphasis is put on the description
of the dispersed phase and on one-particle probabilistic approaches to general non-homogeneous flows.
This is a domain where significant progress has been achieved in the last decade and reporting on these
advances brings out the current status of Lagrangian stochastic methods. A first objective of this paper is
to recall the main aspects of the existing theoretical framework where developments are shown to be set
in. A second objective is to clarify the physics contained in present stochastic models. To that effect, the
presentation of the main aspects of the reference Langevin model as well as the detailed analysis of
several applications covering a range of practical concerns reveal the actual possibilities of these
modeling approaches. A third objective is to report on recent developments that open possibilities for
Lagrangian stochastic methods, including for example first steps toward structure-based models, hybrid
numerical formulations as well as new accounts of particleeparticle interactions. Building on these re-
sults, a formalism is introduced in the last section for the extension of Lagrangian stochastic methods to
particle-laden turbulent flows where the fluid flow is calculated with a Large Eddy Simulation. Finally,
the research areas where work is still needed are outlined.

1. Introduction

As it transpires from their name, Lagrangian Stochastic Methods
(LSM) combine descriptions in terms of particles with stochastic
processes to model the instantaneous evolution of a number of
variables attached to each particle. LSMs are equivalent to proba-
bility density function (PDF) approaches and present strong ad-
vantages for modeling and simulating turbulent reactive particle-
laden flows. In particular, they can treat without approximation
local source terms, however complex or non-linear, when these
source terms are given as known expressions of the variables
attached to each particle as a result of a relevant choice of the
particle state vector. Consequently, LSMs can solve closure prob-
lems related to the average of non-linear local terms, such as
chemical source terms or the drag force which enters the particle
equation of motion. At the same time, the Lagrangian point of view
ensures that convection is treated accurately. This explains that
these methods are well-suited to simulate polydisperse non-
homogeneous two-phase flows.

LSMs started to be considered for disperse two-phase flow
simulations in the 1980s but the first attempts were often made
directly in a discrete setting without a clear separation between the
issues related to the construction of the stochastic model itself and

to the development of adapted numerical schemes. As a result,
these first proposals could contain inconsistencies and even suffer
from mathematical ill-based formulations. LSMs were then put on a
rigorous probabilistic basis in the late 1990s and early 2000s and a
complete theoretical framework was set up [1], while numerical
issues were later addressed in detail (for instance in Ref. [2]). In the
meantime, the PDF approach to single-phase turbulent reactive
flows has been improved (see one of the latest reviews [3]). Prog-
ress has thus been made over the last ten years, not only in terms of
practical simulations for situations of engineering interest but also
on the modeling front where developments have been pursued in
various directions. For example, LSMs have proved valuable to
address the specific subject of particle fouling where the issue is to
model the intricate and complex effects due to the interplay of
hydrodynamics, interface chemistry and surface roughness, while
still allowing industrial applications to be addressed and simulated
(see a recent detailed review [4]).

As such, LSMs have reached a level which makes them attractive
approaches for modeling developments and practical applications.
However, the current understanding of LSMs in the particle-laden
community is sometimes out-of-phase with the actual status of
these methods.
In particular, some misunderstandings remain
about issues such as the physics contained (or not) in classical

Langevin type of models; whether LSMs can address situations
beyond the limit of dilute regimes; or the constraints that must be
satisfied by stochastic models so that they can be regarded as
acceptable PDF approaches, etc. Furthermore, there are still con-
fusions with respect to the status of stochastic models developed
for different particle state vectors or the theoretical framework that
has been established, giving the false impression that a rigorous
background still needs to be developed. Recent developments and
current possibilities for practical applications are also sometimes
misrepresented. The Lagrangian point of view and the formulation
in terms of stochastic models that are not always familiar to re-
searchers can also hinder the assessment of LSMs.

1.1. Objectives of the present article

The purpose of this work is to discuss the actual status of
Lagrangian Stochastic Methods with the specific aims of clarifying:
(i) the theoretical framework; (ii) the physical content of current
Langevin models; (ii) the range of application of these methods;
(iv) the possibilities opened by recent developments based on new
modeling ideas; (v) the formalism for the extension of LSMs in the
context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for the calculation of the
fluid phase.

This paper deals essentially with the PDF description of the
dispersed phase and does not address in many details the PDF
formulation of the continuous fluid phase. Nevertheless, the latter
is present and is often used as a reliable background, for example in
the analysis of the fluid, or tracer-particle, limit when particle
inertia vanishes. Descriptions of the complete fluid and particle
phases are possible and have been proposed [1,5,6] but are not
considered here. As mentioned above, the PDF approach for single-
phase turbulent reactive flows has been well covered [7e9,3] and,
in that sense, the present article is a continuation of previous works
both for single- and two-phase flows.

It is also important to outline the points that this paper does not
address. First, a comparative analysis of the different theoretical
frameworks that have been proposed for disperse two-phase flows
(for instance, kinetic-based PDF versus dynamical descriptions or
Moment approaches) is not covered. Some of these questions were
discussed elsewhere (see, in particular, Sections 7.2 and Section 7.3
in Ref. [1]), though it cannot be claimed that this issue has yet
received a comprehensive treatment. This definitively requires a
specific work that will be addressed separately. Second, only one-
particle PDF methods are basically considered in this article and
discussions on two- or even N-particle PDF are left out. Third, if the
numerical implementation of LSMs is discussed, computational
aspects (in terms of a detailed assessment of computational costs,
memory requirements, etc.) are not developed as information on
some of these elements can be found in other works (see Ref. [2]).
Finally, the objective of the different applications that are consid-
ered is essentially to illustrate LSMs and shed light on their ability
to simulate various real-life applications. Yet, a comparative
assessment with respect to other numerical approaches in each
situation is not within the scope of the present article.

rial and advancing toward most recent developments. The equa-
tions describing particle momentum, which constitute the
mechanical description of particles in turbulent flows, are first
discussed in Section 2. The main elements of the theoretical
framework, making up the PDF approach to polydisperse two-
phase flows, are recalled in Section 3. Present state-of-the-art
represented by the class of Langevin models, are
models,

addressed in Section 4 where the emphasis is put on outlining the
physics contained in these formulations through the presentation
of the reference Langevin model. The ability of LSMs to address
different situations is best revealed with practical applications and
different examples are detailed in Section 5. The objective of Sec-
tion 6 is to present modeling ideas that go beyond classical Lan-
recent developments that

natures of turbulent coherent structures as well as extensions to
account for particleeparticle interactions are reviewed there. The
extension to particle-laden flows where an LES is used for the fluid
phase is addressed in Section 7. Finally, conclusions and perspec-
tives are discussed in Section 8.

2. The starting point: selecting the fundamental governing
equations

In disperse two-phase flows, the basic physical situation is made
up by a continuous fluid phase (a gas or a liquid) in which a set of
discrete ‘particles’ (solid particles, droplets, bubbles, etc.), having a
range of diameters, are embedded. The governing equations of the
fluid phase are the continuity, the NaviereStokes and the transport
equations for a set of scalar fields which gathers the relevant spe-
cies mass fractions f
to which an equation for
f
the fluid enthalpy is added, along with an equation of state for
compressible flows. For constant-property flows, these equations
are

These fluid scalar equations are stated here for the sake of
completeness as they are briefly referred to when the limit case of
fluid particles is considered in Section 5.2.1. They are also implicitly
present in the presentation of the industrial application of coal
particle combustion in furnaces (this is the example developed in
Section 5.2.2) but are not explicitly needed in the rest of this article.
The NaviereStokes equation in Eq. (1b) is written as for a single-
phase flow. Being the description of the fluid instantaneous ve-
locity field, it is valid at locations x where no particles are present at
time t but source terms can be added on the rhs to account for
momentum exchange between the fluid and the discrete particles
when two-way coupling (whereby particles influence the fluid
phase) is deemed important. This point is addressed in Section 4.4.
The main purpose of this article is, however, on the treatment of
the dispersed phase and, in the following, we concentrate mostly
on the governing equations which are used to describe particle
dynamics, while specific particle thermal effects (droplet evapo-
ration, particle combustion, etc.) will be discussed through appli-
cations in Section 5.2.

2.1. Hydrodynamical forces on particles

Adopting a Lagrangian point of view, the governing equations
for particle dynamics are obtained by applying the fundamental
laws of classical mechanics and are expressed by the following
equations for each of the discrete particles carried by a turbulent
flow

dxp
dt

1⁄4 Up;

mp

dt

1⁄4 Ff /p

þ Fext;

where xp is the location of the particle center of mass, Up its velocity
and mp the mass of the particle. In the momentum equation Eq.
(2b), Ff/p represents the forces exerted by the fluid on the particle
and Fext the forces due to external fields such as gravity.

In this description, it is seen that the first equation, Eq. (2a), has
a simple form. Yet, it shows that particle transport is treated
without approximation by Lagrangian approaches [7,1]. Thus, the
issue is to express the forces exerted by a turbulent flow on a
particle embedded in the fluid. Though apparently simple and
considered as early as the mid-19th century, the question of the
precise derivation of these forces has proved extremely difficult.
Present formulations retain the so-called drag, lift, added-mass and
Basset forces (see Refs. [10,11]) which are added to the gravity force,
though the expression of these forces can vary according to
different authors. However, the available expressions for lift forces
have only been obtained in specific situations, resulting in widely
different formulations [1,12,13], and no consensus about a general
expression has yet emerged. The expression of the Basset force is
also still debated and, consequently, present models for these two
forces cannot be regarded as being reliable enough. For this reason,
we choose to leave out the lift and Basset forces in the present
work. Then, the particle momentum equation can be written as

Ref. [1]) and the last terms added to Us on the rhs of the above
equations correspond to the so-called Faxen terms [10e12]. In Eq.
(3), the first two terms on the rhs correspond to the fluid acceler-
ation and to the buoyancy force while the third term is the general
form of the drag force written with the drag coefficient CD and the
fourth term is the added-mass force. The added-mass force is also
expressed with an added-mass coefficient CA (usually taken simply
as CA 1⁄4 1/2) and is a function of the difference between the accel-
eration of the fluid seen (along its own trajectory) and the particle
acceleration while the drag force is expressed in terms of the ve-
locity slip US

For small particles (say dp≪h

neglected and the usual form of the particle momentum equation is
obtained as

Relying on this point-approximation for particles, the velocity of
the fluid seen is now simply expressed as the local instantaneous
value of the fluid velocity at the same time and at the particle po-
sition, which means that we have Us(t) 1⁄4 Uf(t,xp(t)) where Uf(t,x)
represents the fluid velocity field (without having to separate un-
disturbed and disturbed fluid velocity fields).

The added-mass force is important for bubbles in a liquid flow,
where the density of bubbles rp is much smaller than the fluid one
(rp ≪ rf), and can be also relevant for small sediments in a liquid
medium when rp ~ rf. However, for particles heavier than the fluid
r
f , it can be shown that the drag force is the dominant force

In this paper, unless explicitly said so, we will regard Eq. (10),
where only drag and gravity forces are retained, as the reference
particle momentum equation. As with the extension of the particle
relaxation timescale to account (partially) for added-mass effects, it
is also possible to consider an extended version where the fluid
pressure-gradient term is kept and which has the form

If gravity is clearly an external action, it is important to realize
that the two accelerations due to the fluid pressure-gradient and
the drag force respectively have different physical meanings: the
pressure-gradient term arises from the ‘undisturbed part’ of the
fluid velocity field (as if the particle was a fluid element) whereas
the drag term arises from the ‘disturbed part’ (created by the
presence of a non-fluid element). This distinction is an important
aspect in the derivation of the different forces on a particle [10]. The
consequence is that only the drag force term represents an actual
exchange of momentum between the fluid and a particle and this
distinction is of significance when two-way coupling needs to be
accounted for, as will be seen in Section 4.4. The form of the particle
momentum equation given in Eq. (15) is useful for sediments and
bubbles for which the fluid pressure-gradient is an important
driving force.

2.2. Brownian effects and particle motion

In the expression of the forces due to hydrodynamical effects,
Brownian motion has been left out. However, for colloidal particles,
it is important to account for Brownian effects. Depending on au-
thors, the definition of a colloid varies but a reference criterion is
obtained by comparing velocities due to hydrodynamical effects to
typical velocities representing Brownian motion. For a particle in a
fluid at rest, the balance of the drag and gravity forces yields the so-
called free-fall (or terminal) constant velocity

The same is true for rising bubbles where the balance yields that

theorem of statistical physics, it is known that, at equilibrium with a
fluid at a temperature Tf, the particle kinetic energy is given by

where kBis the Boltzmann constant (the equipartition theorem is
written here in the three-dimensional case, thus the factor 3/2 in
front of the Boltzmann term to account for the three independent
directions). For the present case, a 1D formulation in the vertical
direction aligned with gravity is sufficient and a colloidal particle is
defined as a particle for which Brownian effects induce velocities
which are of the same order as the free-fall one. Basically, this
criterion is stating that colloidal particles do not sediment under
the action of gravity as random upward velocities due to Brownian
effects are enough to counterbalance the gravity pull. This means
that

which shows that colloidal particles have typically a diameter of the
order of a few microns or less dp (cid:4) 1(cid:2)2 mm, while for dp (cid:5) 5(cid:2)10 mm
particles are called inertial and Brownian effects can be neglected.
There are two ways to introduce Brownian effects. The first
possibility is to add a white-noise term in the particle position
equation implying that the system of equations becomes (retaining
only the drag force)

The new particle position equation is now a stochastic differ-
ential equation (SDE). A more precise introduction to stochastic
diffusion processes and SDEs will be proposed in Section 3 and,
thus, these considerations are in a slight anticipation of the defi-
nitions provided there. Nevertheless, for the time being, the basic
ideas can be easily understood from a physical point of view and are
useful for the discussion of thermophoresis effects in the next part.
The second possibility is to add a white-noise term into the
particle momentum equation which, then, becomes a generaliza-
tion of the historical Langevin equation. The system of equations
has now the form

where the particle momentum equation has been turned into a
SDE. In Eq. (21b), the diffusion coefficient KBrown is obtained by
considering again that, in a fluid at rest, the particle kinetic energy
is constant and given by the equipartition of energy. This corre-
sponds to the most basic (and simplest) form of the so-called
fluctuation-dissipation theorem [15] which yields that

(22)

It is then seen that KBrown decreases as d

p when the particle
diameter is increased and becomes negligible for inertial particles
while it should be retained in the colloidal range. Furthermore, it is
also straightforward to show that the Langevin description in Eq.
(21) contains the Einstein one in Eq. (19) as a limit case. This is
obtained by considering the long-time limit, or the situation when
tp becomes small with respect to an observation time scale Dt, and
is referred to as the ‘elimination of fast variables’ (see Section 4.1
and [15,1,2]). Indeed, when tp≪Dt, the continuous limit of Eq.
(21b) is (see the derivation in Ref. [2] in particular)
(cid:6)

(23)

where the white-noise term in Eq. (21b) has been shifted to the
particle position equation (in this limit, UpðtÞxUsðtÞ). By comparing
Eq. (23) with the general diffusion law in Eq. (19a), it is seen that the
corresponding diffusion coefficient is

which, with the expression of the particle relaxation time scale in
the Stokes regime in Eq. (12), is indeed equal to the Einstein
diffusion coefficient in Eq. (20).

The evolution equations in Eq. (21) appear as the most general
expression. Indeed, this form is valid for inertial particles (for which
KBrown is negligible) as well as for colloidal particles (for which
gravity is negligible). Therefore, in the present article, Eq. (21) are
retained as the reference evolution equations for particle dynamics
in isothermal conditions. If the extended version in Eq. (15) with
the fluid pressure-gradient is preferred to describe hydrodynamical
forces, then Eq. (21b) is replaced by the corresponding extended
version

Before addressing the key issue of how to model the velocity of
the fluid seen Us(t)in Sections 3e4 and assessing current and new
formulations in the following ones, some clarifications are in order
with respect to the question of whether other effects should be
added to the particle momentum equation.

2.3. Remarks on the particle equation of motion

It is sometimes wondered whether other forces must be added
to account for phoresis-like effects. The term ‘phoresis’ refers to a
flux created by the action of a ‘driving force’ and is often formulated
in the language of generalized thermodynamics through fluxeforce
relations (see for instance [16]). If this is the case, the particle
momentum equation would have the following form

as

the

such

force,

resulting

Coulomb

For electrophoresis effects, the situation is simple and the
answer to the above question is clearly yes. For example, if particles
have an electrical charge qp and are placed in an electric field Eel(t,x)
(which can be created or modified by other particle charges), then
the
force
Fel(cid:2)phoresis 1⁄4 qpEel(t,xp), should indeed be added to the rhs of Eq. (26).
For turbophoresis, the situation is perhaps less simple at first
sight but the answer to the above question is clearly no. Actually,
adding an extra term to the rhs of Eq. (26) on the grounds that it
accounts for turbophoresis would be incorrect since this effect is
already, and naturally, captured by the fluid velocity seen Us(t) in
the drag force. This is easily understood by considering two sets of
identical particles at two different locations in an inhomogeneous
flow: since the velocities of the fluid seen by each group of particles
are sampled in the distribution of the fluid velocity at each location
and are acting as the (turbo-) driving forces through the drag term,
it is clear that a net flux from the high-intensity turbulence region
to the low-intensity turbulence one is produced. The emphasis is
thus put on accurate and physically-correct representations of the
velocity of the fluid seen (when models are considered), but it is
clear that extra terms in the particle momentum equation are not
required. In that respect, it must be emphasized that turbophoresis
is a hydrodynamical phenomenon and, as such, is directly captured
by the particle equation of motion when this one is properly
written with the relevant forces. In the fluid, or tracer-particle,
limit, this question is related to the issue of the spurious drift ef-
fect which, although fully explained some time ago [17,18], is still a
potential source of confusion in the two-phase flow community. In
short, for fluid particles there is no net turbophoresis as the effect is
counterbalanced by the pressure-gradient while there is naturally a
turbophoresis effect for solid particles but which is already
accounted for in Eq. (21b). This point is briefly addressed again in
Section 4 and discussions can be found in Refs. [1,19].

The issue of thermophoresis is more involved and a clear-cut
answer is not immediately obvious.
Indeed, thermo-phoresis,
which refers to a mechanism of particle transport in response to
a macroscopic temperature gradient in the fluid phase [20], is a
molecular-induced phenomenon (contrary to turbo-phoresis). It
has been studied for more than 150 years, finding its place in
classical texts [16] and readers are referred to reviews, for example
in Ref. [20], for detailed presentations of the history of theoretical
developments as well as to recent application-oriented in-
vestigations Ref. [21] or in Ref. [22] for soft-matter illustrations. At a
macroscopic level, thermophoresis is manifested by a concentra-
tion build-up of small colloids in low-temperature regions (see
Fig. 1(a)) and by the appearance of a corresponding thermo-drift
(written as VT in Fig. 1(a)). At a microscopic level and for gases,
thermo-phoresis is explained by the difference between the
impacting velocities of gas molecules on the ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ sides of
a particle. Since the gas molecule kinetic energy is measured by the
fluid temperature, molecules have more energy on the hot side and
the difference between the hot and cold sides produces a net drift
down the temperature gradient (see Fig. 1(b)).

Classical analysis of thermophoresis centers on the so-called
Soret coefficient ST which relates the net particle drift velocity
(the resulting ‘flux’) to the temperature gradient (the ‘driving
force’) through the definition (see for example [20,23,24,21])

with D the Einstein diffusion coefficient given in Eq. (20). Note that
(cid:2)1). However, in the
the Soret coefficient has a dimension (in K
context of the present discussion, it is important to realize that the
dependence of the Brownian coefficient KBrown on the fluid tem-
perature Tf induces already a non-zero thermo-phoresis drift when

Fig. 1. The thermo-phoresis effect in gases: a temperature gradient induces a particle drift toward the low-temperature region (here a wall) creating a concentration build-up (a). At
a microscopic level, the effect is due to the different kinetic energies of the impacting gas molecules on a small solid particle (b).

Tf(t,x) is non-homogeneous. Indeed, the net flux induced by this
diffusion coefficient is

(29)

from which it is seen that the corresponding Soret coefficient is
ST 1⁄4 1/Tf. As a result, if a Soret coefficient is measured or obtained
from theoretical derivations (based on the Boltzmann equation for
gases), it is indeed necessary to add a thermophoresis force FT but
insofar as the effect already present through the diffusion coeffi-
cient is not counted twice. This leads to expressing FT as FT 1⁄4 VTmp/
tp and to writing an extended particle momentum equation which
has the form

(30)

It is thus seen that the last two terms on the rhs of Eq. (30)
represent a stochastic model for thermophoresis effects since
both the drift and diffusion coefficients contribute to the Soret
coefficient. An analysis of numerical applications in the presence of
thermophoresis is discussed later in Section 6.1.1.

For our present purpose, this example of thermophoresis serves
to emphasize that care is needed when considering additional ef-
fects and that piling up extra terms in the particle momentum
equation can turn out to be equivalent to counting twice the same
phenomenon.

3. The theoretical framework of PDF methods

In this section, we present the main aspects of the theory un-
derlying the development of LSMs in the context of Reynolds-
average formulations for turbulent flows. Most of the points dis-
cussed here remain relevant for the extension to the LES context in
Section 7 and, as a result, these theoretical elements form the core
of the framework of PDF approaches.

This framework was first established for single-phase turbulent
flows [7,25,26,9] (see also a recent and extensive account in Ref. [3])
which served as the foundation for the extension to polydisperse

turbulent two-phase flows [1,5,27]. In Ref. [1] and in Ref. [5], a
comprehensive presentation of the PDF approach that contains a
joint PDF description of the fluid and of the dispersed phases was
given and, in that sense, the PDF framework for polydisperse two-
phase flows is complete. A later re-formulation can be found in
Ref. [27]. In the present article, we concentrate essentially on the
dispersed phase, whose PDF description is contained in the joint
fluid-particle one and retrieved by integrating over all fluid vari-
ables. It follows therefore that a complete framework for PDF ap-
proaches to the dispersed phase is already achieved and can be
found in the previously-mentioned works. For these reasons, we
limit ourselves to recalling only the main points and refer readers to
the relevant literature for further details and complementary
accounts.

3.1. A comprehensive probabilistic formalism

3.1.1. Probabilistic descriptions and stochastic equations

In many areas of particle physics, particles are usually described
by the same set of variables (typically, their position and velocity in
a kinetic description) and, consequently, the only existing PDF hi-
erarchy is related to the choice between one-particle, two-particle,
etc., or N-particle distributions [28,29]. In Fluid Mechanics, both for
single- and two-phase flows PDF descriptions, this first hierarchy is
compounded by a second one related to the choice of the variables
selected to describe particle dynamics (this question is discussed in
detail in Ref. [1]). In the following, we consider only one-particle
PDF approaches and the standard Lagrangian approach to two-
phase flows where the particle state vector contains the particle
location and velocity as well as the velocity of the fluid seen by the
particle, i.e. Z 1⁄4 (xp,Up,Us), with evolution equations written as

In these equations, as seen in Section 2 with the particle mo-
mentum equation in Eq. (21b), Dp represents typically the drag and
gravity forces, that is Dp 1⁄4 (Us (cid:2) Up)/tp þ g, and KBrown is the same as
in Eq. (22). In the particle momentum equation in Eq. (31b) and in
the evolution equation for the velocity of the fluid seen in Eq. (31c),

rhs of Eq. (31b) and Eq. (31c) represent the increments of stochastic
integrals which are defined in the Ito sense [31,30,9,1]. In Eq. (31c),
the vector Ds and the matrix Bs are the drift and diffusion co-
efficients of a stochastic diffusion process [31,30] which is a typical
model for the velocity of the fluid seen. Note that in Eq. (31b), only a
scalar diffusion coefficient appears (given by KBrown), which trans-
lates the fact that the corresponding diffusion matrix is actually an
isotropic one. For reasons that will appear in Section 4.2 when
reference models are considered, these models for the velocity of
the fluid seen are often called Langevin models in the physics
literature but their proper mathematical name (stochastic diffusion
processes) is used here.

In the drift and diffusion coefficients in Eq. (31c), a general no-
tation is used to indicate that these coefficients can depend on the
value of the state vector Z but also on functionals of the mean fields
which are calculated from the simulation of that state vector,
written as F 1⁄2〈Z〉(cid:7), as well as on some external fields represented by
〈F〉. It will be seen in Section 4.2 that a typical example of F 1⁄2〈Z〉(cid:7) is
the particle mean velocity field. Since we are only considering a PDF
description of the dispersed phase, all mean fluid fields, such as the
fluid mean velocity, pressure, turbulent kinetic energy and its
dissipation rate, are examples of what 〈F〉 stand for. It must be
noted that the notion of external fields is, of course, directly related
to the choice of the variables entering the state vector. For instance,
if a full fluid-particle PDF description is chosen (see Refs. [1,5] or
other more recent attempts in Ref. [6]), then all mean variables,
whether they are fluid or particle mean fields, would be obtained
from the joint stochastic particle simulations and would appear as
F 1⁄2〈Z〉(cid:7) rather than as 〈F〉 with the above notations.

To introduce more convenient notations, the general evolution
equations in Eq. (31) are re-written under a more compact form as

dZ 1⁄4 DZdt þ BZ dWt

(32)

which is now used to present the key points of the PDF theoretical
framework.

The governing equation, Eq. (32), is to be understood as the
evolution equation for a large number of ‘stochastic particles’
(whose behavior mimics the evolution of real particles in a sta-
tistical sense) and, in a weak sense [30,32,33,7,1], a stochastic
particle-tracking model is equivalent to a PDF approach. However,
it is worth emphasizing that the present case is an extension of
the well-established connection between classical Langevin
equations, where the drift and diffusion coefficients only depend
on the chosen state vector Z(this is, for example, the case in Eq.
(31b)), and the corresponding FokkerePlanck equation in sample
space. In that sense, there is an essential difference between the
Langevin equations used, for example, in PDF methods and in
dispersion studies [9]. The difference is that, in PDF methods, the
coefficients involve statistics obtained from the particles as indi-
cated by the general notation in Eq. (31c). In the mathematical
literature, these processes are referred to as ‘McKean diffusion
processes’ [34] and in detailed physical presentations [30] they
are defined as ‘processes with mean-field interactions’. Compared
to classical Monte Carlo methods, numerical implementations
lead to handling so-called ‘weakly interacting processes’ but,
basically, the classical connection between these generalized
Langevin and FokkerePlanck equations remains valid [30,27]. At
the core of this issue is the notion of ‘the propagation of chaos’,
explained for physically-oriented readers in Ref. [30], which al-
lows weakly interacting processes to be treated like classical
processes (where the samples are independent and, thus, do not
interact) and which will resurface later in the discussion of colli-
sion models in Section 6.2.1. Then, using a slightly different

terminology, a particle-tracking method amounts to a dynamical
Monte Carlo simulation of the corresponding pdf pL(t;z), where
the suffix L indicates that we are dealing with a Lagrangian pdf
and where zstands for the state-vector variables in the corre-
sponding sample space.

3.1.2. From Lagrangian stochastic models to mean-field equations

To derive (Eulerian) mean-field equations from the (Lagrangian)
stochastic equations, Eulerian and Lagrangian MDFs (Mass Density
Function) are introduced [7] where the Eulerian MDF is obtained
from the Lagrangian one. This is translated in the following defi-
nition where the Eulerian MDF is identified with the Lagrangian
one at the same location [1] (the identity is for MDFs and not
necessarily in terms of pdfs)

where Mp is the total particle mass in the domain. These relations
are expressed in sample space and (yp,Vp,Vs) are the sample space
variables corresponding to the stochastic process (xp,Up,Us), while x
is used in the Eulerian MDF. Following the notations introduced in
Ref. [7], the position of the semi-colon (;) indicates whether we are
dealing with Lagrangian or Eulerian probabilistic measures: in the
Lagrangian point of view, the position of the particle xp(t) is a var-

which expresses that the transitional Lagrangian PDF is the carrier
of information since it ‘transports’ the initial Eulerian MDF to obtain
the updated one at time t and location x. The two equations in Eqs.
(34) and (35) are the defining relations at the core of the PDF
framework. In particular, the relation in Eq. (35) shows that pL and
FE satisfy the same (time-forward) equation in sample space and, on
a more physical note, reveals that stochastic particles (which are
the samples of the transitional PDF) play the role of elementary
‘carriers of information’ in the PDF approach.

To simplify the presentation of the following equations and to
show that the relations developed in this section are not dependent
on the choice of a model or on a specific particle state vector, we
introduce the notation Z 1⁄4 (xp,Zc) for the particle state vector where
the particle location is always present and where Zc stands for the
complementary part of the chosen state vector. For example, for the
standard Lagrangian description mentioned above for disperse
two-phase flows, we have Zc 1⁄4 (Up,Us). In sample space, the cor-
responding variables of the state vector are written as z 1⁄4 (yp,zc).
For a particle variable Hp(t;Zc), its average written 〈Hp〉 (note that

this is a field variable), is obtained as

It is worth
emphasizing that ap is a rigorously-defined quantity that repre-
sents the average presence of one phase at a given location. It is
properly defined from the present probabilistic framework and
should not be confused with volumetric averages. In a discrete
sense, when we consider N stochastic particles, the definitions of
the Lagrangian and Eulerian MDFs are directly applied to yield

and the variables in sample space are denoted (yp,Vp,Vs). The par-
ticle mean fields of interest are then derived by integration over the
relevant variables (after multiplication) and by applying the defi-
nition stated in Eq. (36). Applications and comprehensive discus-
sions about
the path leading from (Lagrangian) stochastic
differential equations to (Eulerian) mean fields for a polydisperse
particle phase are developed in Refs. [1,5].

In Ref. [7], it was demonstrated that a stochastic formulation
and the corresponding Eulerian PDF model for single-phase tur-
bulent reactive flows can be regarded as a true PDF description
insofar as the mean continuity equation is satisfied. The same
condition holds for the PDF description of a polydisperse phase and
indicates that the above formalism is complete when the mean
particle continuity equation, which is

is satisfied (the mean particle continuity equation is written here
without mass transfer between the fluid and the particle phases).
This point was discussed explicitly in Ref. [35] along with the
algorithmic consequence for hybrid Moment/PDF simulations
where a new numerical step is introduced at the end of the time-
splitting Lagrangian algorithm so as to correct particle velocities
to ensure that Eq. (42) is respected.

At the end of this overview of the theory underlying PDF de-
scriptions, it is worth emphasizing that, even if a general stochastic
diffusion process has been assumed in Eq. (31c), the PDF framework
is independent from the formulation of specific models. This ex-
plains that the basic theoretical elements were presented before
addressing the physics contained (or not) in present Langevin-
based models which form the subject of Section 4.

4. The physics of present Langevin models

Outlining the boundaries that separate the physics contained in
Langevin models from what is outside their reach is a question that
calls for multiple answers. There are situations where the limits are
rather well-defined, with some variations depending on authors.
There are areas where limits are fuzzy and where clarifications are
required. There are also uncharted regions where applying Lange-
vin models is a step into the unknown.

A comprehensive investigation of this issue would probably
require monographs. Furthermore, answers to this task come for an
important part from practical actions, namely from the feedback
brought by numerical applications. For these reasons, it is believed
the analyses of the different applications presented in Section 5 for
‘classical Langevin models’ and in Section 6 for probes into less-
covered areas contribute also to clarifying the physical content of
Langevin models.

In this section, we are concerned with ‘present Langevin
models’. This means that we are trying to provide answers to a
preceding question: “what kind of Langevin models are we talking
about?”. For this purpose, the main steps along the modeling
approach that leads to present Langevin formulations are briefly
stated. The first step is made up by the choice of the state vector and
is addressed in Section 4.1. Then, the reference Langevin model for
the velocity of the fluid seen, and similar formulations, are intro-
duced in Section 4.2. The expression of this reference model has
interesting properties that are recalled in Section 4.3 where only
the notions that have remained unclear are specifically discussed.
Two-way coupling is addressed in Section 4.4 for the same reason
of clarifying the complete formulation of Langevin models for
particle-laden turbulent flows. A first attempt at discussing
Langevin-like ideas with respect to the emerging issue of particle
preferential concentrations is proposed in Section 4.5.

4.1. The key choice of the particle state vector

The state vector gathers the variables attached to each particle
that are explicitly tracked in time. These variables follow from the
mechanical description of a physical system but this step implies
careful choices. For example, spherical particle dynamics is
described by the equations in Section 2 but we must now select the
variables that define the PDF description we want to develop. This
choice determines the information contained in the resulting PDF
description and the external information that has to be an input.

As mentioned at the beginning of Section 3.1.1, the definition of
the state vector involves a double hierarchy. The first one is related
to the choice of a one-particle, two-particle, etc., or N-particle PDF.
In this paper, as wall-bounded inhomogeneous flows are
addressed, we essentially consider one-particle PDF models (at the
moment, only homogeneous unbounded flows, such as for

10

atmospheric conditions, have been considered with two-particle
models). It follows from the PDF theoretical framework set in
Section 3.1.2 that this corresponds to a one-point (Eulerian) PDF
description. The second hierarchy is related to the variables
attached to each particle and whether we keep only xp, (xp,Up),
(xp,Up,Us), or ðxp; Up; Us; _

UsÞ, etc.

The importance of the choice of the state vector was first put
forward in Ref. [36] and later developed in Ref. [1]. This is a central
issue for two main reasons. The first one is that we need to obtain a
state vector that corresponds to a Markov process, which forms the
only class of stochastic processes for which a complete theoretical
framework can be built. In practice, this means that state vectors
should be tailor-made with respect to each physical context. This
aspect was emphasized in a classical textbook [37] and in a very
pedagogical paper [38]. The second reason rests upon the principle
of fast/slow variables which provides a safe road toward the
formulation of stochastic diffusion processes [15,39,1]. Briefly
speaking, the idea of fast variable elimination can be seen as the
extension of a classical methodology in chemistry when parallel
reactions are involved. Indeed, an usual approach consists in dis-
tinguishing between fast and slow reactions (with respect to their
reaction rates) and in assuming that fast reactions reach their
equilibrium while the concentrations of the species involved in the
slow reactions have not been changed. Carried to the context of
continuous-in-time random functions, these notions correspond to
a separation of the degrees of freedom into slow and fast modes
and to the ‘slaving principle’ by which the fast modes are assumed
to relax very rapidly to equilibrium distributions whose charac-
teristics are determined by the values of the slow modes. For sto-
chastic processes, the eliminated fast modes can then be replaced
by white-noise terms (which correspond to their equilibrium dis-
tributions) while the values of the slow modes enter the diffusion
coefficients. More details can be found in Refs. [15,39] for the
general procedure and especially in Section 4 of [1]. This approach
is especially successful when a separation of scales exists. In that
case, the fast-variable elimination technique has a two-fold inter-
est: first, it leads to a choice of a state vector (containing the slow
modes) that forms naturally a Markov process and, second, it points
to stochastic diffusion processes as relevant models for continuous
processes.

For polydisperse two-phase flows, these ideas suggest to include
the velocity of the fluid seen in the state vector, which becomes
Z 1⁄4 (xp,Up,Us), to describe particle dynamics in high Reynolds-
number turbulent flows [1]. This choice is supported by the fact
that fluid particle acceleration is a fast process at high Reynolds-
number flows, whose effects can then be replaced by the in-
crements of Wiener processes (as long as the observation timescale
is higher than the integral timescale of fluid particle acceleration
which is of the order of the Kolmorogov time scale th). The rationale
behind this state vector as well as detailed physical discussions on
the signification of including the velocity of the fluid seen are
described in Ref. [1] and it is now referred to as the ‘standard
particle state vector’. This choice is valid for inert particles. When
reactive phenomena need to be accounted for, the particle state
vector is naturally extended to include the relevant variables
attached to each particle. Examples are provided in Section 5.2 and,
in particular, through the description of an interesting application
in Section 5.2.2.

4.2. State-of-the-art Langevin models

With the choice of the standard state vector, the general form of
the particle stochastic system is given by Eq. (31) and the last task in
the modeling approach is to build a model for the velocity of the
fluid seen. This is where Langevin ideas enter the picture.

Langevin models form a class of stochastic diffusion models
where the drift term involves a return-to-equilibrium term. This
definition is related to the historical Langevin equation (see dis-
cussions on the historical developments in Ref. [15]). Yet, this his-
torical Langevin equation refers essentially to a SDE where the drift
is linear and the diffusion coefficient a constant (it is called an
OrnsteineUhlenbeck process
literature
[31,33,15,30]). In our context, Langevin models are to be understood
as a generalization of this first attempt, where the drift vector can
contain additional terms added to a return-to-equilibrium term
(that is always present) and where the diffusion matrix can depend
on the variables entering the state vector as well as on external
fields or statistics of the process (see the general form in Eq. (31c)
and the discussion on the expressions of the drift and diffusion
coefficients given there).

in the mathematical

The construction of such Langevin models for single-phase
flows has been mostly realized by Pope and co-workers (see
detailed presentations and discussions in Refs. [7,25,9]) and was
extended later to two-phase flows. An extensive account is pro-
vided in Ref. [1] where a Langevin model was proposed for the
velocity of the fluid seen in general inhomogeneous turbulent
flows. This first formulation was later refined in Ref. [35] where this
model took its complete form. In the following, we introduce
directly this last formulation, which is referred to as ‘the standard
Langevin model’ for polydisperse two-phase flows (for reasons that
will be made clear at the end of this section) and discuss its main
characteristics and status with respect to other formulations.

In this Langevin model, the velocity of the fluid seen is modeled

Apart from being formulated in proper tensor notations, this
Langevin model for the velocity of the fluid seen has three main
characteristics. First, when particle inertia decreases (i.e. tp / 0), it
is seen that the model reverts continuously to the Simplified Lan-
gevin Model (SLM) developed by Pope for turbulent reactive single-
phase flows [7,40,25,9,41].

showing that the SLM corresponds to the well-known Rotta closure
model [9]. The connection between the GLM and (realizable)
Reynolds-stress models is now well established and is a foundation
for the assessment of stochastic models for fluid particle velocities
[26,9,3]. The second property of the Langevin model for the velocity
of the fluid seen is that, in the two-phase flow situation, the
crossing-trajectory effect is accounted for, through the second term

where Tr(H) 1⁄4 Hii denotes the trace of the matrix H and where Rf,
with Rf,ij 1⁄4 〈uf,iuf,j〉, is the Reynolds-stress tensor. It can be noted that
taking the square root of the matrix L does not yield a unique
matrix Bs but a class of matrices related to each other by orthogonal
transformations. However, we are basically interested in a weak
approximation of stochastic processes [30,1], which means that we
are looking for a weak approximation of the corresponding PDF
equation, Eq. (41). Since only the matrix L enters this Fokkere-
Planck equation, it is seen that all the different solutions Bs of the
matrix equation BsBT
1⁄4 L yield the same PDF equation. In other
s
words, all the stochastic systems written with these different so-
lutions Bs give the same statistics and, in a weak sense, are thus
equivalent. This corresponds to the classical notion of ‘equivalent
stochastic systems’ in physically-oriented developments [7,9,1].

This general formulation is best understood by considering a
simpler expression obtained by assuming that 〈Ur〉 is aligned with
the first coordinate axis. With the choice of this coordinate system,

gevin model for polydisperse two-phase flows lies in the expres-

matrix is such that, for particles in a homogeneous region of a
turbulent flow where the local value of the dissipation rate is 〈ε〉,
the turbulent kinetic energy of the fluid seen follows the correct

In a recent study, the above characteristics were raised as
criteria, along with additional requirements that models should
meet in order to be regarded as acceptable descriptions of single-
and two-phase flows [19]. It has emerged that the Langevin model
in Eq. (43) is the only present formulation respecting the set of
criteria. This explains that this model is also referred to as ‘the
complete Langevin model’ for two-phase flows and that it consti-
tutes the standard model for polydisperse flows in a Lagrangian
approach. The lack of alternative propositions that still meet the
above requirements is regrettable, pinpointing that work should be
devoted to improving the standard model.

4.3. Review of the properties of the Langevin class of models

In Ref. [1], a whole section was dedicated to the analysis of the
properties of the Langevin class of models (see Section 7.5 in Ref. [1]).
This included discussions on: (a) Gaussian and non-Gaussian PDFs;
(b) the issue of spurious drifts; (c) the form of velocity autocorrela-
tions; (d) dispersion coefficients; (e) Tchen's formulas for particle
properties in equilibrium with a fluid with constant statistics; (f) an
extension to bubbly flows and (g) the derivation of kinetic PDFs as
the marginal of Langevin descriptions. As mentioned in preceding
subsection, a recent work [19] has put forward key characteristics
that stochastic model for the velocity of the fluid seen should
possess. Thus, the analyses developed in Ref. [19] provide additional
information on the properties of Langevin models.

Over the years, it appears that two points can still be the source
of possible confusion and they are briefly addressed below to
complement available accounts. The first one concerns the form of
the PDF resulting from a stochastic diffusion model (a ‘Langevin’
model): it is sometimes written that the observation of non-
Gaussian PDFs, for example in DNS studies of particles in com-
plex fluid flows, contradicts the use of a diffusion model. This is not
so and, though this is actually a mathematical property of stochastic
diffusion processes, it is important to clarify this property so as to
dispel lingering doubts. The second point is related to the expres-
sion of models in terms of fluctuating velocities and to the re-
quirements that such formulations should respect. Since this
second issue is addressed in detail in the above-mentioned anal-
ysis, it is not repeated here and readers are referred to [19] for
detailed considerations on the forms of stochastic models written
in terms of fluctuating components.

4.3.1. Gaussian and non-Gaussian PDFs

General stochastic diffusion processes were already introduced
in Section 3.1.1 but additional light can be given with respect to
the physical content of the form of the resulting PDF. For this
purpose, it is sufficient to consider a 1D stochastic diffusion pro-
cess, written as

dXt 1⁄4 Aðt; XtÞdt þ Bðt; XtÞdWt with Xðt0Þ 1⁄4 x0

(61)

where A and B are the drift and diffusion coefficients and are
dependent only on the value of the stochastic process X(t). We

are thus handling a classical stochastic diffusion process or, in the
present physical terminology, a Langevin equation. This is not
strictly valid as the drift coefficient A does not necessarily
correspond to a return-to-equilibrium term but this (loose) ter-
minology seems to have caught on. The restriction to a simple
Langevin model (in the sense that McKean extensions due to
dependencies on statistics of the stochastic process 〈F ðXÞ〉, as
discussed in Section 3.1.1, are not introduced) does not change
the following discussion and, therefore, is assumed here for the
sake of simplicity. For this stochastic process, the physical
meaning of the drift and diffusion coefficients can be worked out
by considering the conditional discrete increment over a small
time increment Dt

DXtjðXðtÞ 1⁄4 xÞ 1⁄4 Aðt; xÞDt þ Bðt; xÞDWt;

from which the first- and second-order moments are

〈DXjðXðtÞ 1⁄4 xÞ〉 1⁄4 Aðt; xÞDt;

(cid:4)
(cid:4)ðXðtÞ 1⁄4 xÞ〉 1⁄4 B2ðt; xÞDt:

〈ðDXÞ2

(62)

(63a)

(63b)

The discrete increments in Eq. (62) correspond to the Euler
numerical scheme and the formulation of the increments of the
stochastic integral is consistent with the Ito definition chosen for
this term (see Section 3.1.1). We are thus considering the in-
crements of the discretization of the SDE in Eq. (61). As illustrated
in Fig. 2, A and B account for two different effects:

(cid:9) The ‘deterministic’ term, A(t,x), governs the mean evolution of
the conditional discrete increments of the process (it is thus
referred to as a drift term);

(cid:9) The ‘random’ term, B(t,x), governs the spread of the conditional
discrete increments around their mean values (it is thus referred
to as a diffusion term).

From the properties of the Wiener process, it is clear that the
increments DWt over a time step Dt are indeed Gaussian random
variables. As a consequence, there is a Gaussian hypothesis built in
the Langevin equations. However, as clarified by the relations

Fig. 2. Representation of the conditional trajectories of a stochastic diffusion process,
or Langevin model, which reveal the physical meaning of the drift (A) and of diffusion
(B) coefficients. The Gaussian spread is only for the conditional increments over a small
time interval and non-Gaussian statistics can be captured when the diffusion coeffi-
cient is not a constant.

13

written above, only the conditional discrete increments DXj(X(t) 1⁄4 x)
of the process Xt are assumed to follow a Gaussian spread over the
small time interval Dt. In the very special case where the diffusion
coefficient is constant (as in the original Langevin equation), then
the process Xt itself becomes Gaussian. However, in the general case
where B(t,x) is not constant, the Gaussian hypothesis is only valid
for the conditional increments and the resulting process Xt can (and
usually does) deviate from Gaussianity.

The above reasoning was developed for the discrete increments
of the SDE. However, it is readily seen that this remains true for the
‘infinitesimal conditional
increments’ of a stochastic diffusion
process, in line with the Ito definition. Note then that, in general,
the conditional increments of a stochastic diffusion process are
non-Gaussian. This can be seen with the example of the SDE,
dXt 1⁄4 Xt dWt with X(0) 1⁄4 1. The solution of
this SDE is
Xt 1⁄4 exp(Wt (cid:2) t/2)(usually called the exponential Brownian mo-
tion), showing that the process is not Gaussian and that the con-
increments, which have the same distribution as
ditional

G (cid:2) Dt=2Þ (cid:2) xwith G a standard Gaussian random vari-
able, are also not Gaussian.

Deviation from Gaussianity as soon as the diffusion coefficient is
not constant is further illustrated with a simulation result from an
extended PDF model for fluid particles (with additional terms
added to a GLM to capture viscous effects in near-wall regions [42])
where a spatially-dependent diffusion coefficient induces non-
Gaussian PDFs, as shown in Fig. 3 (see Ref. [42] and also other re-
sults in Chapter 12 of [9]).

4.4. Accounting for two-way coupling

The governing particle equations in Section 2 and the stochastic
models introduced above represent the action of the fluid flow on
the particle phase, which is referred to as the one-way coupling. In
some situations, the opposite action of particles on the fluid flow
must be included in the description, leading to two-way coupling.
In a RANS description, the fluid mean continuity equation, the
mean momentum and Reynolds equations are modified. These
equations have been known for some time and are rather classical.
They can be obtained from the complete PDF approach of the fluid
and particles phases [1,5] but were already derived from two-fluid
approaches [43]. Compared to the single-phase flow case in Eq.
(58b), the Reynolds equation for the fluid flow has the form

It is seen from Eq. (65) that a GLM [40,26,9] is applied to
represent turbulence effects in the fluid phase (providing a model
for the pressure-strain correlation and dissipation terms in the
Reynolds-stress equations).

From these equations, it appears that two-way coupling is
manifested by two effects: first a ‘volume two-way coupling effect’,
whereby the volume fraction of the fluid phase is a less-than-one
space-dependent variable (af(t,x) 1⁄4 1 (cid:2) ap(t,x), with ap the parti-
cle volume fraction defined in Section 3.1.2); second, an ‘energy
two-way coupling effect’, whereby source terms appear at the rhs
of Eqs. (64) and (65) which represent the exchange of momentum
and kinetic energy between the two phases. Indeed, the source
term SUi in Eq. (64) is the average of the total force Fp/f exerted by
all the particles present in a small volume V
f on the fluid phase,
which leads to

where Ap,i stands for the acceleration term in the particle mo-
mentum equation due to the action of the fluid. The source terms
SRij on the rhs of Eq. (65) are basically the ‘works’ performed by this
force (using the word ‘work’ is a loose and tensorial notation).
Detailed presentations can be found elsewhere (see Section 8.5.5 in
Ref. [1]) with discussions about some intricate effects when the
mean value of the velocity of the fluid seen 〈Us,i〉 is not equal to the
fluid mean one 〈Uf,i〉, a situation which is not considered here for
the sake of simplicity.

It is important to note that the expressions for SUi and SRij in Eqs.
(64) and (65) are obtained when only the drag force enters Ap,i, as in
the reference particle momentum equation Eq. (10) or in the
extended one in Eq. (15). If other forces due to the hydrodynamical
action of the fluid flow on particles are added (such as the added-
mass force), the expression of the source terms must be changed
accordingly. This can be done by referring to the particle acceler-
if we
ation due only to hydrodynamical forces. For example,
consider the extended particle momentum equation for non-
Brownian particles in Eq. (15) where the instantaneous fluid
pressure-gradient term is replaced by its mean value, then the
general expression of the source terms in the fluid Reynolds
equations is given by

and by corresponding formulations for the source terms SRij . For
Brownian particles and for the extended particle momentum
equation in Eq. (25), the same is valid as Brownian effects are
external to the hydrodynamical two-way exchanges, but the fluid
momentum source terms should be written as

to isolate properly the only important contribution which is in the
drift coefficient and avoid troubles with the white-noise term. It is
also important to note that, for general polydisperse two-phase
flows, the source terms SUi and SRij are closed when a Lagrangian
approach is used. When two-way coupling effects play a role, this
represents a strong advantage of LSMs and PDF descriptions of two-
phase flows. In that sense, this issue is akin to the closure problem
of the reactive source terms in single-phase mean equations [7,9,3]
which is handled without approximation by PDF methods. It is seen
that the same property is present here and this reflects again the
interest of LSMs for polydisperse turbulent two-phase flows. Since
this is not specifically developed in Section 5 when numerical as-
pects are addressed, it is also worth mentioning that the numerical
discretization of SRij requires some care in order to capture the
correct behavior in the limit of vanishing particle relaxation time-
scales. This issue is discussed with the corresponding proper dis-
cretization elsewhere (see Section 6.1 in Ref. [2]).

Given the typical density ratio rp/rf between particles and the
fluid (which is of the order of 1000 for particles in a gas flow but
only about 1(cid:2)10 in liquid media), two-way coupling effects are
usually accounted for by the momentum and energy exchange
terms while the volume fraction effect is neglected. This is due to
the fact that the mass loading ratio, aprp/afrf, can become higher
than 1 (indicating a significant exchange of momentum that needs
to be introduced in the equations for the fluid phase) while the
volume fraction ap can still be low. For this reason, the above RANS
equations for the fluid phase are sometimes presented assuming
that a
x1for particle-laden flows. However, this is not always so
f
and this situation will be illustrated by one example in Section 6.3.
Finally, two-way coupling has also consequences on the sto-
chastic model for the velocity of the fluid seen. This point is
sometimes overlooked in the Lagrangian literature and in practical
applications where a one-way formulation of a stochastic model for
Us(t) is still applied. However, to be consistent with the modified
fluid equations presented above, it is necessary to change accord-
ingly the model for Us(t). This can be done by writing

dUsðtÞ 1⁄4 ðdUsðtÞÞ

(70)

which is expressed in this general form to emphasize that the issue
not related to the specific choice of a stochastic model for the ve-
locity of the fluid seen in the one-way situation (written as
(dUs(t))one-way). In this equation, dP
p(cid:2)f represents the increments
of an additional term that accounts for the modification of the fluid
due to the reverse action of nearby particles. In Ref. [1], it was
proposed to express two-way coupling in the stochastic model for
Us(t) by adding a term

when only the drag force is retained in Ap as in the reference par-
ticle momentum Eq. (10) (if not, the general expressions already
written above must be used). This is a simple model which has the
correct statistics, in the sense that its mean value 〈Ap/s〉 and the
correlations with the fluid seen 〈Ap/s,iUs,j〉 are correct, with the

practical advantage of being expressed directly in terms of the
variables already present in the particle state-vector. This remains,
however, a crude model in that it does not take into account the
variations of surrounding particle accelerations and a smoother
random model, with the proper correlations, could be considered
as for the stochastic models for the velocity of the fluid when the
complete fluid-particle PDF description is developed (see Section
8.4.2 in Ref. [1] for further discussions on this aspect). This is an
issue where improvements are still needed though, for practical
applications, this simple model has proved interesting [35,2].

4.5. Open modeling issues

In the last two decades, it has been recognized that, even in
statistically homogeneous flows, discrete particles can exhibit non-
uniform distributions. In particular, it has been revealed that par-
ticles tend to correlate with instantaneous structures of the tur-
bulent velocity field: heavy particles are preferentially found in
flow regions of low vorticity and high rate-of-strain while bubbles
concentrate in low-pressure areas. This phenomenon is known as
‘particle preferential concentration’ in turbulent flows.

Though its first qualitative observation can be traced back to the
1960s (see the historical account given in the introduction of a
recent review [44]), the subject really took off in the 1990s and has
been studied ever since (see, among others [45e47]). Particle
preferential concentration is also at play in non-homogeneous
situations, for example in mixing layers [48] and in near-wall tur-
bulent boundary layers [49e52]. The latter issue is related to par-
ticle deposition addressed in Section 6.1.1, where the explicit role of
fluid coherent structures re-emerges.

The notion of particle preferential concentration can easily be
grasped by simply looking at snapshots taken in a DNS in which
particles are tracked. One such example is shown in Fig. 4 which
displays the instantaneous distribution of particle positions in a
homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) flow and for different
particle inertia. Here, particle inertia is measured by the Stokes
number, Sth 1⁄4 tp/th, based on the Kolmogorov timescale which is to
be distinguished from the Stokes number based on the fluid ve-
locity integral timescale, St 1⁄4 tp/TL. As can be observed from Fig. 4,
instantaneous concentration buildups appear in some fluid regions
and are mostly apparent when Sth 1⁄4 O ð1Þ. These observations can
be understood as expressing a ‘resonance effect’ in the interactions
between particles and coherent structures: light particles (Sth≪1)
see all fluid structures while heavy particles (Sth[1) filter out their
effects and, thus, these two particle classes are not subject to
preferential concentrations. However, when the particle relaxation
timescale tp is comparable to the typical lifetime of the fluid
structures (which can be taken as scaling with th in HIT), a marked
correlation between particles and these structures develops. In
other words, these structures ‘capture’ particles having the ‘right’
response time, leading to the particle concentrations seen in Fig. 4
for Sth 1⁄4 1.

For further analysis and results, readers are referred to the
above-mentioned literature and to current publications on this
subject. It is worth noting that the preceding presentation was
made for particles in HIT where a scaling based on the Kolmogorov
timescale appears as relevant. However, this is less obvious in non-
homogeneous flows, such as turbulent channel flows or turbulent
boundary layers, where proper scaling is still a matter of research.
This reflects the fact that, just as for the definition of coherent
structures, the phenomenon of particle preferential concentrations
is easily recognizable in a qualitative manner but more difficult to
quantify objectively.

In the context of this article, we are concerned with the question
of whether this particle preferential concentration effect can be

captured by LSMs. To the author's knowledge, few studies have
addressed in detail this issue (see Refs. [53,54]) and, in this section,
we rely mostly on the latter work [54] which provides a nice
introduction to the subject and also an account of stochastic par-
ticle models in the RANS and LES contexts.

In Ref. [54], particle preferential concentration was studied in a
priori LES fields obtained by filtering a DNS velocity field and the
effects of a subgrid scale (SGS) stochastic model was assessed. One
interest of that study is that the Langevin model proposed to
simulate the SGS fluid motions (filtered out in the LES field) ac-
counts for particle inertia and CTE. The model is written for the
unresolved part of the velocity of the fluid seen (i.e. for u0

context is addressed in Section 7, this is in anticipation of the de-
velopments presented in that section, especially in Section 7.3.2.
Nevertheless, the main ideas can be already understood from a
physical standpoint and they are useful for the present discussion.
It can be also noted that the model in Eq. (72) is expressed in terms
of the unresolved velocity components, which are the counterparts
of the fluctuating velocity components in a RANS context. This was
discussed in Section 4.3 and revealed to be incorrect as terms are
missing. The same is true in LES (see Section 7.3.5), even for sta-
tistically homogeneous flows as the gradients of filtered variables
are not zero. This aspect was acknowledged in Ref. [54] but the
missing terms were thought to be not too significant for the case
considered by the authors of that work.

When t(cid:8)

L;ðiÞ/0, the model in Eq. (72) tends toward a random-
walk while, when t(cid:8)
L;ðiÞs0, the influence of velocity correlations
can be evaluated. Basically, the results discussed in Ref. [54] reveal
that the simple Langevin model above is effective as far as particle
statistics, such as the level of particle subgrid kinetic energy and
velocity correlation, are concerned and tend to produce a
‘randomization’ effect. Thus, the application of this model turns out
to have either a favorable or an adverse effect, depending on the
situation involved. This is illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. In both cases,
the starting point is provided by the results obtained with the a
priori LES (while the reference results are, of course, the DNS ones).
In Fig. 5, light particles are considered and the a priori LES picture is
already blurred (or more diffuse) compared to the DNS one. Thus,
the randomization effect of the SGS model leads to a more diffusive
situation. In Fig. 6, heavier particles are considered (for which the
SGS motions are rapidly-changing) and the a priori LES results
show a sharper particle distribution. As a result, the simple Lan-
gevin model in Eq. (72) does, this time, a good job leading to a
satisfactory restoration of DNS-like particle distributions. More
details and discussions on these numerical results are given in
Ref. [54].

Further investigations, for example with improved formulations
of stochastic models in terms of instantaneous velocities, are
needed but some conclusions can already be drawn. It is seen that
the desired effect of a SGS stochastic model is dependent on the
particle inertia (either promoting or counterbalancing accumula-
tion), whereas the effect of Langevin models, such as the one in Eq.
(72), is always to create some random and blurring effect. This
should not come as too much of a surprise. Indeed, Langevin
models are one class of stochastic diffusion processes and, thus, this
behavior indicates that they live up to their name. Basically, Lan-
gevin models (especially the one in Eq. (72) which represents its
simplest possible form) are structure-less models. This transpires

from the generic form of the SDEs, for example on the rhs of Eq.
(72). It is seen that Langevin models include only the sum of two
contributions: a ‘pure-order’ term (which, in Eq. (72), is pulling
velocity to zero or to a mean value) and a ‘pure-disorder’ one
(which, in Eq. (72), is the Wiener increment). This remains the basis
of this fluctuationedissipation formulation. The Wiener term can
only lead to disorder (it amounts to neglecting the information
related to the fast processes [1]) and to an increase of the variance,
as manifested by the presence of a positive coefficient in the second
derivative of the FokkerePlanck equation.

With respect to this issue, two points are worth emphasizing.

(i) If the behavior of the simple Langevin model cannot be
changed, it must be remembered that Langevin models form
only one class of stochastic models and that no definitive
conclusions can be drawn for general stochastic models. It
will be seen in Section 6.1.1 that new ideas can be proposed
by introducing a collection of simple stochastic models
governed by a parent process and that it is possible to cap-
ture the effects of fluid coherent structures with LSMs.
(ii) Particle preferential concentration is an important effect, but
for some specific concerns (for
for particle
agglomeration which can be increased [55]). For a given
turbulent flow, this is essentially relevant only for one class
of particles (which have the ‘right’ inertia). For many situa-
tions, the real issue is still about capturing particle kinetic
energy and dispersion by the large, energy-containing, scales
of the fluid velocity field. Thus, one must be careful not to
overestimate this effect in practical simulations.

5. Numerical simulations

In that sense,

Once a model has been expressed in terms of differential
equations, numerical schemes can be developed and simulations
performed. At first sight, the previous sentence may sound like an
obvious statement. Yet, in the context of the development of LSMs,
introducing numerical simulations in such a way is meaningful.
Expressing a stochastic model in terms of the SDEs for a large
number of trajectories leads naturally to a discrete version where a
large number of samples are generated at each time step of a
calculation but skipping that step and writing directly the discrete
version is dangerous.
for many years, a clear
distinction between the ‘continuous-in-time model’ and the ‘nu-
merical model’ was lacking. To be more specific, many Lagrangian
approaches for particle-laden flows proposed during the 1980s and
1990s were formulated directly in terms of Markov Chains or in
terms of AR-TS (Auto-Regressive Time Series) but without obtain-
ing these discrete formulations as numerical schemes built from a
continuous-in-time model written first in terms of stochastic dif-
ferential equations. There was thus a considerable confusion and a
near-impossibility to regard all these numerical results (some of
which were innovative and interesting) other than ‘mere tricks’
that ‘mimic’ the effects of turbulent flows on discrete particles. This
state was even reflected in reviews throughout the 1990s (see for
example [56] or [57]) where there was no notion whatsoever of the
requirement to express models as proper SDEs, or to derive field
equations from the stochastic models so as to compare them with
macroscopic formulations, not to mention the formulation of sim-
ple criteria that must be met by models. To provide an example, it
was even thought that any form of the auto-correlation of the ve-
locity of the fluid seen can be input into AR(1) (Auto-Regressive
scheme of order 1) formulations (see Refs. [56,57]), whereas it is
in
straightforward to show that

homogeneous turbulence imply that this form must be a simple
exponential function rather than a free choice. Furthermore, many
formulations were flawed by a misunderstanding of the issue of
spurious drifts in the tracer-particle limit which was made obscure
in the absence of any derivation in continuous time. These repre-
sented severe shortcomings and obstacles to the development of
Lagrangian simulations.

This introduction on the historical development of numerical
applications suggests therefore that the first sentence in this sec-
tion is actually expressing a selection criterion. As LSMs were only
given a comprehensive framework at the beginning of the present
century [1,5], we limit ourselves to numerical simulations where
discrete versions are obtained as the integration of a LSM expressed
beforehand in terms of SDEs. This represents the first selecting
criterion for the numerical applications to be reported in this sec-
tion. Since then, there has been also a considerable number of
practical simulations. Unfortunately, several of these model for-
mulations were not checked with respect to some of the criteria
mentioned in Section 4 or proved to be inconsistent with them
(there are, regrettably, some typical examples in the study of par-
ticle deposition [58e63] where the fluid limit is not well repro-
duced as analyzed recently [19]). Thus, as a second criterion, we
limit ourselves to numerical examples obtained with a model
formulated in such a way that the basic criteria discussed in Section
4 are met. Finally, this section is restricted to calculations per-
formed with the ‘classical’ form of a Langevin-type of a LSM for the
particle phase and in the context of Reynolds averages for the fluid
phase, while numerical examples corresponding to new stochastic
approaches will be discussed in Section 6 and the context of LES-
based fluid simulations is addressed in Section 7.

The purpose of the present section is not to provide a compre-
hensive catalog of all the existing numerical applications but to
select a number of them in order to:

(a) illustrate how LSMs are applied in practical situations;
(b) outline their potential as well as their limitations;
(c) reveal their interest to provide insights into complex-physics

situations;

(d) report on new numerical ideas and algorithms that open

interesting perspectives.

To that effect, numerical examples relying on particle dynamical
characteristics (basically simulations of statistics related to particle
locations and velocities) are presented first in Section 5.1 where the
emphasis is put on validation aspects before considering recent
industrial applications. The potential and interest of LSMs for
complex-physics situations is illustrated in Section 5.2 by the
detailed presentation of a recent development carried out in the
context of an industrial application related to coal combustion and
the energy industry. New numerical ideas based on the develop-
ment of hybrid Moment/PDF algorithms are addressed in Section
5.3 and conclusions while perspectives on these numerical appli-
cations are proposed in Section 5.4.

5.1.1. Validation issues
5.1.1.1. Reference test
the LSMs
considered in Section 4 were validated by assessing numerical
predictions with respect to reference test cases. These test cases
included, in particular, a wall-jet two-phase flow with two-way
coupling, a cyclone separator with one-way coupling and a bluff-
body recirculating flow also with two-way coupling. These test
cases were presented along with the formulation of the reference
LSM especially in Refs. [1,35] and when numerical developments

were analyzed in Refs. [70,2]. As detailed analyses of the numerical
predictions can be found in these references, they are not repeated
here. Yet, it is relevant to put forward that these test cases represent
challenging situations and, in that sense, this validation step in-
dicates that LSMs can be regarded as being put on solid foundation.
Among the different test cases mentioned, the wall-jet case will be
used again in section 5.3 but the most important one is probably
the bluff-body recirculating case. The so-called Hercule experiment
(see Refs. [65,66]) is a representative example and involves poly-
disperse particles coming across a recirculation zone with a stag-
nation point and where local particle concentrations are high
enough to modify the fluid flow. The Hercule set-up is typical of
coal-burners and the validation of present LSMs in this configura-
tion provided a sound basis for the extension to coal combustion
and other complex-physics issues that will be detailed and dis-
cussed in Section 5.2.2. It is thus proposed that this case be regar-
ded as one requirement in the validation toolbox for any model to
be tested. These validation cases were also helpful in providing
interesting feedback on sensitive issues of Lagrangian computa-
tions which are worth outlining in the rest of this subsection to
provide a more complete view of the characteristics of numerical
approaches based on present LSMs.

5.1.1.2. The importance of suitable numerical schemes. A detailed
account of the various steps involved in the numerical imple-
mentation of a LSM is outside the scope of the present review, as
they were addressed in detail in Ref. [2]. Only the most important
aspects are recalled. Basically, a Lagrangian simulation involves
three major steps: (a) interpolation of the fluid mean fields at
particle locations; (b) update of the particle state vector by inte-
grating the corresponding SDEs (plus applying boundary condi-
tions and possible corrections to enforce consistency constraints);
(c) calculation of particle statistics. The first and third steps (steps
(a) and (c)) are mirror ones or, in a matrix formulation, one step is
the adjoint of the other one [2]. This represents a point which is
sometimes overlooked: the interpolation scheme (i.e. obtaining
particle-based values, such as the mean fluid velocity, from the
grid-based mean fluid fields) and the way particle statistics are
extracted (that is going from the particle-based instantaneous
values to grid-based mean particle fields) are reverse operations.
For example, it would be inconsistent to use a linear interpolation,
or a higher-order scheme, while calculating particle statistics with
the Nearest-Grid Point (NGP) technique (see a classical presenta-
tion in Ref. [67]). To have consistent operations, the use of a linear
interpolation scheme for the projection of mean fluid field onto
particles should go hand in hand with the use of the CIC (Cloud in
Cell) method for the extraction of particle statistics [2]. While such
a consistent approach is preferable to the grid-based piecewise
scheme (no interpolation for particles located within a given cell
and application of the NGP technique), it is easy to understand that
it is difficult to implement in complex geometries where block
unstructured grids are often used. This explains why, at the
moment, industrial calculations are easier to be carried out with
the lowest-order scheme which, nevertheless, guarantees consis-
tent operations within the Lagrangian algorithm.

Among the steps mentioned above, the choice of the numerical
scheme for the integration of the SDEs (step (b)) requires special
attention. If we write the SDE for the evolution of the particle state
vector Z under a general form as

dZ 1⁄4 Ddt þ BdW

(73)

where the explicit dependence of the drift vector D and the diffu-
sion matrix B on the state vector and mean fields has been left out

18

J.-P. Minier / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 50 (2015) 1e62

for the sake of simplicity, then a numerical scheme can be
expressed as

Znþ1 1⁄4 Zn þ DZðDtÞ

(74)

where DZ(Dt) represents the numerical increment and is related to
the choice of a specific numerical scheme to integrate the rhs of Eq.
(73) over a time step Dt. A key point is that the expression of DZ(Dt)
must be consistent with the Ito definition of the stochastic integral
in Eq. (73). This consistency aspect of SDE is trickier than for ODE
(ordinary differential equations) but this has been stressed in
several works on stochastic models [7,30,1] and in specific works on
numerical schemes for SDEs [68,32,69,2]. Overlooking this issue
can result in inconsistent numerical schemes and in flawed simu-
lations, as it turned out to be the (unfortunate) case on occasions
[64]. To be on the safe side, the usual answer to that difficulty is to
stick to the Euler scheme which consists in writing

DZðDtÞ 1⁄4 DnDt þ Bn

p

ffiffiffiffiffiffi
Dt

z

(75)

where z is a vector of independent normal random variables and
where the values of the drift and diffusion coefficients are evalu-
ated at the beginning of the time step. Such a scheme is first-order
in the weak sense (see Refs. [32,68]) and is often retained in
practical calculations. However, this explicit scheme induces a
limitation on the time step. This can be illustrated with the particle
momentum equation (leaving out gravity for the sake of simplicity),
Eq. (10), for which the application of the basic Euler scheme yields

Straightforward analysis shows that such a scheme remains
stable when we have that Dt (cid:4) minðtpÞ (which is also needed to
respect the positivity constraint when variables, such as mass
fractions, are considered). This condition remains also valid for
stochastic differential equations [68]. Thus, for the typical system of
stochastic equations used for the description of disperse two-phase
flows, which involves a relaxation term in the equations for Up
(with tp the typical timescale) and for Us (with T (cid:8)
L the typical
timescale), the Euler scheme in the form expressed by Eq. (76)
remains
that

stable when we have, at

the same time,

1⁄4 T (cid:8)

For academic test cases and when a nearly monodisperse set of
particles is considered, this constraint does not necessarily repre-
sent a strong limitation. However, this is not so when strongly
inhomogeneous fluid flows are considered or when the distribution
in particle diameters is widely spread. In these cases, T (cid:8)
ðxÞ can
L
vary strongly depending on the particle location. Furthermore,
since tp scales typically as d2
p, handling a set of particles exhibiting a
large variation in diameter means that there can be several orders
of magnitude between the corresponding particle relaxation
timescales. Yet, the stability constraint on the time step implies to
limit Dt by the smallest value of the particle relaxation timescales
and by the smallest value of the timescale of the fluid seen that can
be met in a flow. If the fluid flow is not necessarily highly turbulent
everywhere but can nearly re-laminarize even in a very small re-
gion, this timescale can become very small (see the discussion in
Ref. [2]). Clearly, the simple scheme of Eq. (76) implies limitations
that can quickly become drastic for practical applications. It must
also be remembered that for two-phase calculations performed
with a Moment/PDF (or Euler/Lagrange) approach, this time step
can be further constrained by the fluid flow computation.

For these reasons, a new numerical approach was developed
based on the idea of exponential schemes. The basic idea of these

schemes is to discretize the integrated form rather than the dif-
ferential form. For the example of the particle momentum equa-
tion, this leads to considering

where the general case of variable tp has been included by freezing
its value at the beginning of the time step. Compared to the Euler
explicit scheme in Eq. (76), the exponential scheme in Eq. (78) is
still a first-order scheme in a weak sense [68] but is now uncon-
ditionally stable. These ideas have been developed into numerical
schemes for the complete particle stochastic system in Eq. (31)
(where the velocity of the fluid seen is modeled by the Langevin
model given in Eq. (43)) both for first-order and second-order
formulations. This approach is presented in Ref. [70] and dis-
cussed in detail elsewhere [2].

It is worth emphasizing that these numerical developments
have allowed a current application of LSMs (with a system of
equations with a form similar to the one considered in Section 4) in
practical situations. These numerical schemes are built so as to
respect the asymptotic limit situations where one, or both, of the
physical timescales (tp and T (cid:8)
L ) vanish. These limits are captured by
the same numerical scheme, regardless of the ratios Dt/tp and
Dt=T (cid:8)
L . This is illustrated in Fig. 7 on the test case of particle point-
source dispersion in a stationary homogeneous turbulence, where
particle dispersion is measured by computing 〈x2

The two results displayed in Fig. 7(a) and (b) were obtained with
the same numerical scheme (note that, as the diffusion coefficients
and timescales are constant in that case, the first-order and second-
order schemes yield exactly the same results [70]). The case shown
in Fig. 7(a) corresponds to the general situation where Dt≪tp; T (cid:8)
L .
This is also manifested by the fact that, for small elapsed times
(when t (cid:4) tp; T (cid:8)
ðtÞ〉 scales as t2 as it should be since the time
step Dt is sufficiently small to capture explicitly the deterministic,
or ballistic, regime before the particle velocity and resulting loca-
tion are randomized by the action of the fluid velocity seen. The
case shown in Fig. 7(b) corresponds to the opposite situation where
the two timescales tp and T (cid:8)
L become vanishingly small with respect
to the observation reference timescale which in the numerical
calculations is the time step Dt. In this case, particles behave as fluid
particles (since tp≪Dt) and follow a diffusive law (since the fluc-
tuations governed by T (cid:8)
L are now fast and induce a random walk
limit model

can be seen in Fig. 7(b), the numerical schemes retrieve the diffu-
sive regime after just one time step and reproduce the correct
physical behavior (additional results and analysis can be found in
detailed works [70,2]).

5.1.1.3. Consistency between turbulence models in the fluid limit.
In this article, we are focused on LSMs for the treatment of the
particle phase. Yet, for turbulent flows, this does not mean that
choosing a turbulence model for the fluid phase is independent
from the selection of a given LSM for the particle phase. Indeed, if
we consider a Langevin-type of model for the velocity of the fluid
seen, then the fluid mean properties are provided to the SDEs that
express the evolution of the trajectories of the stochastic process.
These mean fluid fields are obtained with a certain turbulence
model. On the other hand, the stochastic process retained for Us(t)
corresponds also to a turbulence model and, in the tracer-particle
limit, to a fluid turbulence model. This was recalled in Section 4.2
where the tracer-particle limit of Eq. (43) was shown to retrieve
the SLM in Eq. (55), or perhaps a GLM one as in Eq. (56) should such
extensions to Eq. (43) be considered. This fluid limit is consistent
with a second-order model expressed by the equations Eqs. (58)
and (59) and this raises a consistency issue: what happens if the
fluid mean fields provided to the Lagrangian solver are obtained
with a turbulence model that is not consistent with the second-
order closure corresponding to the Langevin model for the veloc-
ity of the fluid seen in the tracer-particle limit? For the specific
example of the reference Langevin model in Eq. (43), what happens
if 〈Uf〉, 〈Pf〉, k and 〈ε〉 are not obtained from the corresponding Rotta
second-order model? Strangely enough, this consistency issue (in
the tracer-particle limit) does not seem to be well-recognized or
always taken into account whereas it is of importance for practical
calculations which are usually run using a Moment/PDF, or Euler-
ian/Lagrangian, approach.

The consequences of using incompatible turbulence models
were addressed in Ref. [71] where it was shown that ‘forcing’ a
given Langevin model with inconsistent mean fluid fields can lead
to spurious energy production rates and artificial values of the
Reynolds stresses in a channel flow. This is illustrated in Fig. 8
which shows the resulting profiles when DNS results are fed into
a SLM compared to a consistent hybrid formulation where the
mean fluid fields provided to the SLM are obtained from a Rotta
Reynolds-stress model [71] (this corresponds to the results indi-
cated as standard hybrid model in Fig. 8). The purpose of the hybrid
DNS/PDF calculation was to show that the belief that ‘the more
precise the fluid statistics, the better it is for the Langevin model’ is
quite misleading. In that sense, DNS (which is not a model) pro-
vides the most accurate prediction for the fluid mean properties but
is seen to induce spurious turbulent kinetic energy levels in the
hybrid formulation. Note that the profiles and values of the mean
velocity and Reynolds-stress components obtained with the stan-
dard hybrid method are exactly what they should be, given the
chosen Rotta model used for the computations.

As mentioned above, these results are of direct significance for
practical computations where the mean fluid fields are calculated
with a Moment approach and input into the Lagrangian solver. The
consistency issue has been exemplified here for the particle
dynamical variables but is also quite relevant for two-phase reac-
tive flows. If we consider, for instance, evaporating droplets or
shrinking solid particles (due to inner combustion processes), then
these discrete elements become good approximations of tracer
particles. It is then important that their dynamics be well captured

as this will govern their correct or incorrect displacements in re-
gions where important reactive processes can take place. Further-
more, it must be noted that this consistency issue is also present for
the different scalar variables included in the particle state vector.

5.1.2.

Industrial applications

In this section, a numerical example showing the applicability
and the interest of LSMs for industrial situations is presented. The
industrial context is related to studies of nuclear reactor safety
pumps whose representative geometry is displayed in Fig. 9(a)
while streamlines of the resulting water flow inside the pump are
indicated in Fig. 9(b).

As the inlet water flow can carry particles (corrosion products,
fragments deposited along the upstream walls that can be re-
entrained by the turbulent water flow, etc.), the object of the nu-
merical investigations is to determine how the distribution in size
of the particles is changed between the pump suction and the
hydro-cyclone filters that are installed to protect the pump metallic
linings and bearings. Predicting this distribution is important as the
hydro-cyclone filters are designed to achieve a certain separation
efficiency which, in turn, depends on the size distribution of the
particles entering these filters.

The flow inside such a pump is quite complex since it involves a
rotating part (the rotor) inside a fixed part (the stator), each con-
taining blades which are used to redirect the water flow. The issue
at stake can be focused on the centrifugal part of the pump or the
rotor/stator system represented in Fig. 10 where the injection, the
boundary conditions for particles hitting a blade as well as the
outlet boundary zone are indicated.

Simulating water flows inside such a complex geometry is
actually a challenging task and the numerical results presented in
this section were obtained by new techniques for block-structured
meshes (applied between the two grids used for the rotor and
stator, respectively) before being validated on two pump test cases
[73]. Particle tracking inside this geometry represents also a chal-
lenging effort and the numerical developments were first validated
by considering particles in a given solid-body rotating fluid flow on

outlet.

the complete mesh structure displayed in Fig. 11(a). For this
particle-tracking validation case, the blades that constitute an
important part of the real geometry (see Fig. 10) were removed but,
on the other hand, the sketch of the two connected meshes in
Fig. 11(a) is helpful to reveal the two different parts made up by the
rotor and stator which are not evident in the complete geometry in
Fig. 10. Using a known fluid velocity field with a solid-body rotation
structure, it is possible to derive the exact particle trajectory fol-
lowed by particles injected from a given source location. A first-
order numerical scheme is applied (using the general numerical
scheme proposed in Ref. [2] in the limit case of laminar flows which
is referred to as asymptotic case 4 in Ref. [2]) and the convergence
rate curve of the L1-norm error plotted in Fig. 11(b) follows indeed a
linear slope which validates the particle tracking method in the
present hybrid mesh structure.

Once validation test cases for the water flow predictions and
particle tracking methods were satisfactorily run, simulations were
performed on the so-called ERCOFTAC centrifugal pump test case.
This test case is a reference for turbo-machinery situations [74] and,
although there are unfortunately no data for particles, it can be
used as a benchmark. Typical calculations were run for particles
corresponding to two different Stokes numbers. For these simula-
tions, the model corresponds to the general particle stochastic
system, Eq. (31), with the Langevin model, Eq. (43), for the velocity
of the fluid seen. In both cases, a large number of particles were
injected at t 1⁄4 0 and followed inside the diffuser. Results for par-
ticles with a small Stokes number, St ~ 1, are shown in Fig. 12. It is
seen that these light particles tend to follow the fluid streamlines,

spreading outwardly as a nearly-perfect concentric layer and with
particle velocities that are rather homogeneous.

When heavier particles are considered, a different picture
emerges. For example, numerical results obtained for particles with
a Stokes number of 100 are displayed in Fig. 13.

It is seen that the resulting particle distribution is more uneven
and that, more strikingly, these inertial particles tend to split into
small groups, or lumps, which are also spread in a thicker area
compared to the lighter particles. It also appears that these inertial
particles tend to have significant interactions with the blades and
that the conditions used for these interactions (here, for instance,
particles rebound upon impinging on a blade) have an impact on
the resulting distributions. Furthermore, a scatter in the velocity
distribution can now be observed, particularly at times t 1⁄4 0.025 s
and t 1⁄4 0.03 s.

In the scope of the present review, this numerical example is
helpful to show that LSMs are currently used in practical cases. As
illustrated by the application discussed in this section, the ability of
LSMs to treat particle transport and polydispersity without
approximation makes them valuable tools even in complex
situations.

5.2. Applications for reactive and complex-physics flows

The numerical examples presented so far concerned mostly the
dynamical aspects of particle motion in turbulent flows. This is
justified insofar as particle dynamics is the building block ensuring
that particle transport and dispersion by turbulent flows are
correctly captured. However, the interest of the LSMs becomes
more evident when complex physics comes into play. By complex
physics, it is meant here additional physical phenomena such as
reactive processes, droplet evaporation, particle combustion, etc.
These phenomena require new variables to be introduced (e.g.
particle temperature, concentrations for a number of species, inner
composition for heterogeneous solid particles, etc.) and new in-
formation to be produced (such as the pdf of scalar concentration
for some scalar species). When continuous models are formulated,
accounting for these complex-physics phenomena and their
interplay with particle dynamics in a complete numerical approach
can be a daunting challenge. Yet, especially when the models
retained for the description of these phenomena are written as
local expressions in terms of variables entering the particle state
vector, they can be handled without approximation by LSMs. The
purpose of the present section is to illustrate how additional

models for complex-physics phenomena can be included in a
Lagrangian stochastic approach.

5.2.1. Single-phase reactive turbulent flows and spray combustion

As this article is essentially devoted to the probabilistic treatment
of the disperse phase in two-phase flows, a description of PDF ap-
proaches for the fluid phase is outside its scope. Moreover, detailed
works have already addressed PDF methods for turbulent reactive
single-phase flows (see Refs. [7e9]) and progress on these aspects
has been well-covered in a comprehensive review [3]. However, it is
worth emphasizing that single-phase PDF descriptions are contained
as a limit case of the PDF formulations developed for two-phase
flows.
Indeed, when the particle relaxation timescale vanishes
(tp / 0), the discrete particles become fluid notional ones and, since
the model for the velocity of the fluid seen is made so as to revert to
an acceptable model for fluid particles, a Lagrangian PDF model for
the fluid phase is naturally retrieved. This is verified for the
dynamical variables but the limit of the models used for the particle
reactive variables needs to be assessed separately.

Spray modeling is an issue of great practical importance directly
Indeed, two-phase flows with
in line with present concerns.
droplets as the disperse phase involve specific mechanisms such as
droplet breakup and coalescence. The physics of turbulent dilute
spray combustion has been discussed at length in a recent review
[6] and several examples of the application of LSMs for this subject
can be found in this article. Yet, the issues of droplet collisions and
coalescence, as well as primary and secondary atomization or
droplet breakup in dilute sprays which can occur in the presence of
sufficiently high turbulence, were not covered in that article. Some
of these topics are addressed in the present review, in particular in
Section 6.2 which covers particleeparticle interactions and particle
agglomeration (or coalescence) in the context of LSMs. In that
sense, the developments presented later on in that section com-
plement the ones presented in Ref. [6].

For these reasons, an industrial example related to coal com-
bustion is now developed to illustrate the interest of LSMs for
reactive turbulent two-phase flows.

5.2.2. Coal and biomass co-firing for energy generation

A significant proportion of non-nuclear electricity-generating
power plants still rely on the process of pulverized coal

combustion. In this process, coal is first ground into small parti-
cles, with diameters ranging from a few microns to a few hun-
dreds of microns and with a typical mean diameter of about
30(cid:2)50 mm. Coal particles are then injected into a furnace with co-
flowing gases. An outside view of a typical furnace geometry is
shown in Fig. 14(a) with an indication of the air inlets while a
sketch of the important features of the gas flow in Fig. 14(b) in-
dicates that a recirculation zone (referred to as the internal
recirculation zone) is created in order to obtain a stable flame.
Injected coal particles interact with this complex flow structure
which increases their residence time in this important region for
the combustion process. It is interesting to note that the valida-
tion case represented by the recirculating bluff-body flow
mentioned in Section 5.1.1 is actually a model for such furnace
inlet conditions and for the resulting flow patterns created near
the burner.

A recent technological innovation consists in substituting a
small fraction of the inlet coal loading with biomass and in the
combined combustion of both coal and biomass fuels. This process
is referred to as coal biomass co-firing and has been promoted for
both environmental and economical reasons. The interest is to
reduce CO2 emissions, or other greenhouse gases, by burning
renewable fuels while there can be marked economical incentives
due to public regulations, through a system of buy/sell quotas. At
the moment, coal biomass co-firing is performed by introducing
about 10% of the inlet mass loading as biomass while 90% is still
made up by classical coal feedings. This minor modification of the
inlet mixture composition has the advantage of allowing the coal/
biomass mixture to be fired without requiring major modifications
of existing plants and is thought not to decrease the efficiency of
the overall process in a significant manner.

However, recent observations and feedback from power plants
have pointed out that such coal and biomass co-firing modifies
some important characteristics of the combustion process.
In
particular, two issues have been brought forward. First of all, it has
been observed that in co-firing furnaces the remaining proportion
of the carbon content in fly and bottom ashes is higher, indicating
that more unburnt carbon is left compared to coal-only feeding
loads. A second observation is that such co-combustion seems to
increase slagging and fouling in the furnace, as illustrated in Fig. 15
[75].

for
vestigations and have been an incentive for recent model de-
velopments and numerical studies. Before addressing the interest
of Lagrangian stochastic approaches for such analysis, it is neces-
sary to describe the model retained for the composition of solid fuel
particles (which means coal and biomass particles from now on),
the combustion scenario and the modeled equations for the various
steps of the combustion model.

5.2.2.1. Fuel particle composition. In the present approach, coal and
biomass particles are both assumed to be made up by three com-
ponents: reactive coal, water and ashes. The main component is
coal which can typically represent about 80% of a coal particle. It is
referred to as ‘reactive coal’ since, after the devolatilization process
(to be described below), this coal is transformed into a char residue.
There is also a water fraction, or moisture content, which is usually
very low for coal particles (say, of the order of a few per cents) but
that reach up to 40% for some biomass particles, as is the case for
green wood biomass. The third component is ash which is inert
(though the ash content can play a role in the combustion process
by limiting the diffusion of oxygen towards the char core). There-
fore, the mass of each particle mp is the sum of the water fraction
mp,water, the reactive coal mass mp,rc (where the index rc stands for
reactive coal) and of the ash content mp,ash.

5.2.2.2. The combustion scenario. Combustion of solid fuel particles
is classically described by a three-stage scenario:

1. Particle drying: as fuel particles are injected at ambient tem-
perature in the primary air inlet, their moisture content is
vaporized when they meet hot gases and under the effect of
heat radiation inside the furnace.

2. Devolatilization: above a temperature of 400(cid:2)500 +C, the
devolatilization step, or pyrolysis, starts where the reactive coal
contained in the solid fuel particle is transformed into volatile
products which are burned in the particle surrounding hot gases
and into a carbonate residue which is char.

3. Char combustion: once char has been formed, a heterogeneous
combustion process begins and the carbonate residue is burned
with the oxygen from the air phase.

From this overview of the combustion scenario and from the
modeled particle composition, it already appears that a numerical
description implies to associate a number of additional variables to
each solid fuel particle. Indeed, these particles cannot be charac-
terized only by their total mass mp but the different steps require to
know mp,water, mp,rc, mp,ash and also mp,char and mp,vol (the mass of
char and volatiles formed through the devolatilization process). In
order to understand the interest of Lagrangian stochastic methods,
a brief description of the modeled equations for these variables is
now given.

5.2.2.3. Description of the combustion model. The three stages of
the combustion scenario are presented successively.

(i) The drying step is modeled by assuming that the partial
pressure of water vapor is given by the equilibrium vapor
pressure at the particle temperature. During this phase, it is
considered that the solid fuel particle keeps a constant
diameter and that the moisture content, which is taken as
being initially uniformly distributed inside the particle, re-
cedes as drying proceeds. This represents a shrinking spher-
ical model with the front of the moisture core being located at
a radius rp,drying which diminishes, as illustrated in Fig. 16.

Then, by considering the mass conservation equation for water
as its vapor diffuses away from the particle (or away from the
drying front), we get that

Reynolds number Re and the Schmidt number Sc), while ceq

the vapor mass fraction at equilibrium determined at the particle
temperature and c∞
p;vapor is the vapor mass fraction in the gas phase
away from the particle.

The drying phase implies an energy exchange between the solid
fuel particle and its surroundings which accounts for the energy
consumed by the water phase change. Thus, the energy exchange
term for the drying phase is expressed by

(ii) Various models have been proposed for the solid fuel devo-
latilization process (see among others [76e78]). In the pre-
sent formulation, we retain the classical Kobayashi model
[79] which represents devolatilization by two parallel and
competing decomposition reactions which have different
reaction rates:

the formation of light volatile products and char at low tempera-
tures while the second one represents the formation of heavier
volatile products and char at higher temperatures, the high-
low-
temperature
temperature one. In terms of the variables attached to each solid

reaction being much faster

(86)

where Y1 and Y2 are the two stoichiometric coefficients (typically
Y1 1⁄4 0.37 and Y2 1⁄4 0.74). It is seen from the last equation that,
during the devolatilization phase, char is being produced and it is
assumed that its combustion does not begin until the pyrolysis step
is over. Other approaches can be found (see for example a simul-
taneous account of pyrolysis and combustion in Ref. [80]) but, for
our present purpose, this distinction is not within the scope of the
present paper. The devolatilization process is assumed to take place
with a fixed particle volume, which implies that the particle density
is decreasing due to the release of the volatile products. Finally, the
heat release corresponding to the formation of these volatiles is
neglected.

(iii) Once char is formed, the third stage corresponding to a
heterogeneous combustion takes over. For the sake of
simplicity, we retain here the simple assumption which
consists in regarding char as being made up only of carbon
and ashes (which are chemically inert) and in writing a single
chemical reaction, i.e. C þ 1/2O2 / CO [81] (more details on
combustion can be found in existing reviews [82]). During
this process, it is further considered that the density rp,char
remains constant (with a value that is calculated at the end of
the devolatilization phase) while the diameter of the char
core dp,char decreases as combustion is going on. Then, the
evolution equation for the mass of char inside the solid fuel
particle is expressed by

several limiting steps, typically the diffusion rate of oxygen in the

The formulation of the combustion model can be summed up by
the following steps displayed in Fig. 17: the drying phase, where the
moisture content is evaporated leaving only reactive coal and the
inert ash content at a constant particle volume, is happening first
(Fig. 17(a)); then, the devolatilization phase, where char is pro-
duced and volatiles are released, still at a constant particle volume
but with a decreasing density (Fig. 17(b)); beginning of the com-
bustion phase where char is consumed at constant particle density
but with a shrinking particle diameter while the inert fraction
made up by the ash content remains present (Fig. 17(c) and (d)).

Since many of the parameters introduced in the modeled
equations, Eqs. (80)e(94), are dependent on the particle tempera-
ture, the combustion model is completed by expressing the evo-
lution equation for Tp. By accounting for the heat exchanges due to
the radiation flux fR received inside the furnace, the heat release

due to drying (Eq. (82)) and to combustion fcomb, (Eq. (94)), the
evolution equation for the particle temperature is

The first term on the rhs of Eq. (95) is the heat exchange due to

the Nusselt number Nu 1⁄4 hc dp/lf and the particle Reynolds number
Re and Prandtl number Pr such as

Nu 1⁄4 2 þ 0:6Re1=2Pr1=3

(96)

The convective heat flux is a function of the difference between
the solid fuel temperature Tp and the local instantaneous gas
temperature Tf at the particle location. This gas temperature seen
by solid fuel particles can be simulated with a micro-mixing model,
such as the simple IEM which is written as

with tc the micro-mixing timescale. This timescale can be esti-
mated as in single-phase reactive flow model [7,9,3], although tc
stands here for the timescale of the fluid temperature seen by solid
fuel particles as they move in a turbulent flow and, therefore, could
contain CTE as for the timescale of the fluid velocity seen (see
Section 4).

5.2.2.4. Consequences on the choice of
the modeling approach.
From the description of the complete combustion model, it is seen
that, in spite of simplifying assumptions, the set of equations, Eqs.
(80)e(95), form an intricate model. By gathering the variables
(mp, dp, Tp, Tf, mp,water, mp,rc, mp,ash, mp,char, mp,vol, dp,char, etc.) in the
particle state vector and writing them as Zcomb, it is seen that the
modeled equations can be reset in a compact form as

(98)

where 〈J〉
f stands for mean fluid fields or quantities (such as the
mean fluid temperature or the radiation heat flux). This formula-
tion is valid since the present micro-mixing model is the IEM model
in Eq. (97) which has the form of a deterministic equation. If an
explicitly-stochastic model is retained for Tf, then Eq. (98) becomes
a stochastic differential equation.

As it is evident from Eq. (98), the modeled system of equations is
naturally expressed in terms of particle variables and appears as
closed. This indicates that the present solid fuel particle combus-
tion model is treated without approximation by LSMs or, in other
words, that the physics represented by the present combustion
model is handled without approximation by LSMs. Note, however,
that there is an underlying dependence on the particle location in

26

J.-P. Minier / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 50 (2015) 1e62

Eq. (98). Then, when a model for particle dynamics is added, for
example by considering the model discussed in section 4, the
complete particle state vector becomes Z 1⁄4 (Zdyn,Zcomb) (with
Zdyn 1⁄4 (xp,Up,Us)) and the global evolution equation is expressed by
the general form
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(99)

where the extended drift vector D contains F for the corresponding
variables in Zcomb while the diffusion matrix is actually a sparse
matrix since non-zero terms appear only for the sub-matrix cor-
responding to the velocity of the fluid seen. Since we are handling
the joint vector Z 1⁄4 (Zdyn,Zcomb), the closed form of Eq. (99) in-
dicates that the interplay between solid fuel particle dynamics (or
particle motion inside the furnace) and the combustion process (or
coal firing) is also treated without approximation. The correct
treatment of these three aspects constitutes a strong advantage of a
Lagrangian stochastic approach.

However, many numerical approaches developed to simulate
such gasesolid flows in industrial configurations of thermal power
stations are based on the moment approach, or also referred to as
the two-fluid or Euler/Euler approaches [83e86,43,80]. These two-
fluid approaches have benefited from the great body of knowledge
accumulated over decades on grid-based methods and present also
the advantage of handling the coupling terms between the gas and
particle flows within the same formulation. On the other hand, it is
clear from the discussions put forward in this review that moment
approaches are not well-suited for a precise treatment of the pre-
sent combustion model since they are faced with the classical
closure issue of averaging local but highly non-linear terms.

For the specific issue of pulverized coal combustion, interesting
formulations were proposed with a view toward industrial appli-
cations [83,84]. Starting from the combustion model represented
by Eqs. (80)e(95), they are based on two further simplifying as-
sumptions. First of all, coal particle inertia is neglected and it is thus
assumed that coal particles follow fluid streamlines (the velocity
slip between gas and particle is neglected). Second, the effects due
to the fluctuations of the fluid temperature seen and to the particle
temperature in the combustion model equations are either
neglected or based on assumed pdfs. As a consequence, the inter-
play between coal particle dynamics and combustion is simplified.
Neglecting coal particle inertia may be surprising at first sight but if
we remember that coal particles have a typical average diameter
around 30 mmand that we are interested in particle motion in very
large domains (the size of an industrial furnace is larger than 10 m),
this assumption is not too unreasonable. Representing the rate of
chemical reaction based only on the mean fluid and particle tem-
perature is more limiting, for example for the important hetero-
geneous combustion phase and in the expression of Kc in Eq. (92)
(remember that 〈KcðTpÞ〉sKcð〈T〉
Þ), although the overall formula-
p
tion remains useful for industrial applications.

5.2.2.5. Challenging issues for biomass particles. Even if moment
approaches can be regarded as acceptable for coal particles, the
development of the coal biomass co-firing technology raises new
issues. Indeed, the presence of biomass particles modifies the
modeling picture in two important aspects [87]. The first one
concerns particle inertia: biomass particles are much larger than
coal particles and have diameters that can be as high as 800 mm. In
that case, the ratio of the particle relaxation timescales between a
the order of tp,biomass/
coal and a biomass particle is of
tp,coal ~ 25(cid:2)50(accounting for a density ratio of about 4 between
coal and biomass), which means that the inertia of biomass parti-
cles can no longer be neglected and that particle motion for the

polydispersed set of biomass particles has to be accounted for.
Moreover, these large particles are in general not spherical, indi-
cating that directional drag forces have to be accounted (this spe-
cific issue is not pursued here). The second aspect concerns the
thermal inertia of biomass particles which, due to their larger size,
is very different from those of coal particles: this implies that the
combustion process inside a biomass particle takes place differ-
ently. Indeed, for a (relatively) small coal particle, the combustion
scenario can be represented by the following sketch (see Fig. 18).

As already mentioned, the combustion scenario is sequential
but the most important point is that, at each step of the process, a
coal particle is only in one state. In other words, each stage of the
combustion process is assumed to take place homogeneously
within coal particles. However, this assumption cannot be main-
tained for biomass particles.

The difference between the thermal responses of coal and
biomass particles can be assessed by comparing their respective
Biot numbers. The Biot number Bi is a measure of the ratio between
the resistance to thermal transfer inside a particle and at its surface:
it is expressed by Bi 1⁄4 hV p=lpSp(V p and Sp the volume and sur-
face of a particle, lp the particle thermal conductivity and h the
convective heat coefficient representing the surface heat exchange
with the particle gaseous surroundings). Typical estimations [87]
yield that, while we have Bi (cid:4) 1 for coal particles, values as high
as Bi (cid:5) 10 can be found for biomass particles. Thus, thermal in-
homogeneities inside biomass particles cannot be neglected and
refined descriptions must be introduced.

Steps in that direction have been taken in recent developments
[87] where each biomass particle is decomposed into a number of
concentric layers (say between 5 and 20 layers) to account for the
differences between the processes happening within each layer. For
each layer, the same modeled combustion process is assumed to
take place but each layer evolves following its own thermal dy-
namics. Therefore, the evolution of the combustion for a biomass
particle can be represented as in Fig. 19.

Clearly, this refined model allows delays between the different
processes to be taken into account: combustion can be taking place
in the outer layer while the devolatilization process is happening in
the next inner layer and drying in the successive one while the
inner core is still intact (see the last step represented in Fig. 19). This
refined model implies that the temperature equation in Eq. (95),
which is meaningful for a coal particle, must be replaced to describe
thermal transfer inside a biomass particle. This is done by consid-
ering heat conduction inside a biomass particle [87] and by
formulating the heat equation as

5.2.2.6. The interest of Lagrangian stochastic methods. The industrial
context and the specific issues described above point to the need of a
modeling approach that can treat precisely: (a) particle transport,
(b) the combustion model and (c) the interplay between particle
dynamics and combustion effects. These requirements are clearly
met by LSMs where particle transport and the complete combustion
phenomena represented by Eqs. (80)e(95) are handled without
approximation as well as their coupled effects. In particular, the
influence of the fluctuations of the fluid and particle temperatures
on the various coefficients entering the combustion model equa-
tions are exactly accounted for. As for single-phase turbulent reac-
tive flows, this represents a strong advantage which explains not
only the suitability but the attractiveness of LSMs for such studies.

5.2.2.7. Numerical
illustrations. By implementing the present
combustion model into the existing Lagrangian module of a soft-
ware (in that case, the open source Code Saturne), such a joint
numerical simulation of dynamical and thermal effects can be
achieved for co-firing applications. Based on the industrial config-
uration presented in Fig. 14(a), recent numerical results have been
obtained [87]. It is worth noting that the Lagrangian simulations
have been carried out with an interesting hybrid approach: indeed,
a two-fluid model for the gas and coal particles is first applied
[83,84] and the Lagrangian calculations are run for the biomass
particles. Since coal makes up about 90% of the inlet particle mass
flux, this allows the coupling between the gas flow and the particles
to be well accounted for and the Lagrangian calculations for the
biomass particles are then performed, using the fluid predictions
from the two-fluid (air-coal) model, in a one-way approach (since
the biomass inlet mass flow rate is only about 10%, the influence of
the biomass particles on the gas flow is neglected, as a first
approximation). This hybrid numerical procedure is helpful to
emphasize that Moment and PDF approaches (or Euler and
Lagrange) are not mutually exclusive approaches and can be
applied together for challenging situations.

Though this is an ongoing study, first numerical outcomes have
provided useful insights into the resulting phenomena inside co-

firing furnaces. It was stressed in Section 3 that LSMs are proba-
bilistic approaches in a weak sense and, thus, that the meaningful
quantities are the statistics derived from the dynamical Monte
Carlo simulations. Nevertheless, useful information can be derived
from the observation of the history of an ensemble of particle tra-
jectories and of the typical evolution of the variables attached to
them. In the geometry of the furnace shown in Fig. 14(a), a number
of biomass particles having a diameter of 800 mm are injected at
room temperature in the air primary inlet and are tracked inside
the furnace. The injected particles come across the internal recir-
culation zone with the complex fluid flow structure created by the
swirl imposed in the secondary air inlet and the high gas temper-
atures which exist in this region. There is then a competition be-
tween the combustion processes and the residence time of these
large particles in the flame region. In Fig. 20, the trajectories of a set
of biomass particles are presented and are colored by their reactive
coal mass fractions. It is seen that, when thermal differences are
neglected inside particles (which means that biomass particles
follow the combustion steps sketched in Fig. 18), the remaining
reactive coal mass fractions are higher than when the complete
multi-layer model is adopted (which means that biomass particles
follow the combustion steps sketched in Fig. 19). This indicates that
accounting for the time delay due to temperature conduction inside
biomass particles is important.

When the multi-layer model is used with 5 concentric layers for
each biomass particle, analysis of the resulting reactive coal mass
fractions for each layer confirms that there are marked differences
inside a biomass particle. It is seen in Fig. 21 that there are still
important reactive coal mass fractions at the core of the biomass
particles while for the outer layer, which is exposed to heat radia-
tion and to high gas temperatures, devolatilization appears to be
over.

Further numerical results reveal that high temperature differ-
ences exist between the core and the outer layer, as displayed in
Fig. 22. These temperature differences are important to capture
since they lead the various processes involved in the combustion
model to start at different times and, more importantly, to proceed
at different rates since chemical reaction rates are highly depen-
dent on the particle temperature (here on the temperature existing
in each layer inside each biomass particle). With the complete
multi-layer combustion model and the present Lagrangian formu-
lation, the resulting particle composition (which means the particle
moisture content, coal, char and ash fractions) is believed to be
better predicted at the outlet of the internal recirculation zone and
when biomass particles move toward the furnace walls where they
deposit depending on their temperature and on their composition
(which influences their sticking property).

With respect to the physics involved in these contexts and to the
information that can be extracted from the simulations, it can be
concluded that LSMs have now proved to be valuable numerical
tools to investigate such complex-physics situations.

5.3. Development of new hybrid moment/PDF algorithms

Apart

from the construction of

the numerical schemes
mentioned in Section 5.1.1, there has been further progress on
numerical aspects and the purpose of this section is to report on
new algorithmic approaches for disperse two-phase flows.

Numerical analysis of LSMs has brought out that numerical er-
rors are due to the deterministic, bias and statistical errors. This was
investigated in the context of single-phase turbulent flows (see
Ref. [69]) and later for polydisperse two-phase flows (see Ref. [2]).
Among the different errors, statistical noise is an inherent charac-
teristic of Monte Carlo methods and, consequently, LSMs are also
subject to the rule of the CLT (Central Limit Theorem). This

unavoidable feature is at the core of the slow convergence rate of
Monte Carlo methods (where statistical noise scales as N
with
Np the number of samples used to evaluate statistics), though this
does not necessarily limit their interest, especially to solve PDEs in
high-dimension spaces (see Ref. [7]). If the CLT is not to be escaped,
there has been an ongoing effort to devise numerical methods to
reduce the level of statistical noise. These variations of the original
MC (Monte Carlo) method are referred to as VRTs (Variance
Reduction Technique) since their purpose is to reduce the variance
of the MC numerical estimator [88]. One technique is to use avail-
able information on some moments to correct particle instanta-
neous variables [88,89] which has lead to hybrid formulations.

The development of hybrid algorithms stems from the obser-
vation that in the classical Moment/PDF approach the fluid phase is
always described by a Moment approach while the particle phase is
always described by a PDF approach. In numerical terms, we are
thus always dealing with FV/MC (Finite Volume/Monte Carlo)
methods for the Fluid/Particle system. However, why not use a

compound approach whereby particles would be described by an
hybrid formulation based on moments and instantaneous
trajectories?

An original hybrid technique was proposed for single-phase
variable-density flows [90e93] where mean-field equations are
solved for the fluid mean density and velocity fields, 〈rf〉 and 〈Uf〉,
while still simulating the stochastic models retained for a large
number of fluid particles. However, the Reynolds stress is extracted
directly from the particle set. This results in a new hybrid formu-
lation in which the physical level of description between the two
solvers (Eulerian and Lagrangian) is strictly identical and where
information is exchanged between the two formulations: 〈rf〉 and
〈Uf〉 are provided to the Lagrangian solver while 〈uf,iuf,j〉 is fed in the
Eulerian one. This idea was considered for polydisperse two-phase
flows [94e96] and recently developed in a new hybrid numerical
approach [97,98]. A detailed account of the present state of devel-
opment of these new ideas can be found in Ref. [99] and only the
key aspects are presented below.

5.3.1. Leading principles

The new hybrid method can be used with different formulations
but we present the leading ideas for isothermal flows and particles

which is of importance for the developments to follow. For the
reference Langevin model for the velocity of the fluid seen [1,35]
discussed in Section 4 and assuming, for the sake of simplicity,
that the mean relative velocity is aligned with one axis of the

mean velocity and volumetric fraction are used in the SDEs that
describe the evolution of the particle state-vector in Eq. (103). In
turn, the particle kinetic stress 〈up,iup,j〉 is provided by the particle
model and is extracted as the second-order moments calculated at
each point from the set of particles. In that sense, both descriptions
of the first two moments related to the particle phase correspond
exactly to the same physical model. The principle of the new hybrid
method is emphasized by rewritting the evolution equations for
the two particle descriptions using the superscript “L” to indicate a
mean quantity obtained from the PDF description and “E” to indi-
cate a mean quantity which is obtained as the solution of the
Moment description:

The new hybrid method corresponds to a Moment/Moment-
PDF approach for the fluid and particle system and is sketched
in Fig. 23. In numerical terms, it is seen that the classical FV/MC
method has been replaced by a new FV/FV-MC hybrid
formulation.

Moment-PDF description corresponding to the algorithm A defined below in Fig. 24

5.3.2. The purpose of the new hybrid approach

As mentioned in the introduction of this section, the interest is
to obtain a less noisy estimation of the particle mean velocity,
leading to improved predictions of the particle variables. The
introduction of a Moment approach for the particle phase yields
also an estimation for the particle volumetric fraction ap which can
be used to correct particle locations. Furthermore, the use of less-
noisy estimations for 〈Up,i〉 can reduce the bias error (see discus-
sions in Refs. [69,2]). In that sense, the new hybrid formulation is
meant as a VRT for Lagrangian simulations of polydisperse two-
phase flows.

However, the reasoning behind this new hybrid formulation
hinges upon the fact that the estimations of 〈Up,i〉 provided by the
Eulerian solver are less noisy than a direct ensemble-average esti-
mation from the Lagrangian solver. This is not a foregone conclu-
sion as it is seen that Eq. (107b) is a PDE which contains a noisy
source term on the rhs of Eq. (107b) and, more importantly, a
transport term involving the spatial derivative of the particle ki-
〉L which is also noisy. In practice, for the new
netic tensor 〈up;iup;j
hybrid description to act as a true VRT, the ability of the FV solver
retained for the particle Eulerian solver to provide stable non-

stationary numerical approximations to Eq. (107) even when
noisy data are introduced becomes a central issue.

5.3.3. Different algorithms

Two different algorithms have been proposed to implement this
new hybrid method and are represented in Fig. 24. In the first one,
called algorithm A, there is no enforcement of the consistency re-
lations between the duplicate fields and, in that sense, particle
volumetric fractions and mean velocities are predicted both by the
Lagrangian and the Eulerian solvers. On the other hand, checking
the differences between these duplicate predictions can be used as
a criterion to assess whether the numerical predictions are
converging toward the same solution.

The second algorithm, called algorithm B, is an extension of
algorithm A in order to enforce the consistency of duplicate fields at
each time step of the computation. Compared to algorithm A, it is
seen that an additional correction step has been added so as to
ensure that we have

at each discrete time, whatever the choice of the numerical pa-
rameters which are Dx the mesh size spatial discretization, Dt the
time step (for the integration in time), and Npc the number of
particles in a given cell from which statistics are extracted by MC
estimations. The implementation of the consistency step, Eq. (108)
in algorithm B implies to correct particle positions and velocities at
the end of each time step. This induces an additional computation
effort [7,89,100]. On the other hand, it can be noted that algorithm B
naturally enforces the normalization condition that was discussed
in Section 3.1.2. This is a strong point of this discrete formulation as
it guarantees, as a by-product, that Lagrangian calculations remain
meaningful PDF descriptions with a finite number of particles and
non-zero values of the mesh size and time step.

A central aspect of the discrete implementation lies in the nu-
merical choices made for the particle Finite Volume solver approx-
imating the solutions of the PDEMoment
in Eq. (107). In that respect,
p
the solutions proposed for the new hybrid method applied for two-
phase flows [97e99] differ from the numerical choices made in the
development of the hybrid method for single-phase flows [91,92].
Indeed, the numerical approach proposed in Refs. [97,98] is based on
a combined use of relaxation-type techniques and upwinding
schemes (see a first presentation in Ref. [95]). In practice, this means
that this original numerical solution of Eq. (107) relies on a three-
step splitting technique, which can be outlined as follows (a
detailed description is given in Refs. [98,99]):

5.3.4. Numerical results

Based on the algorithm A of the new hybrid method described
above, simulations were obtained [98] for the test-case of the
particle-laden wall jet mentioned in Section 5.1.1. The geometry is
presented in Fig. 25 where the following dimensions: Lx 1⁄4 1.0 m,

31

The analysis of these results (see discussions in Ref. [99]) shows
that, while predictions of the coupled Eulerian and Lagrangian
solvers converge, there is a reduction in the noise of the hybrid
Lagrangian formulation compared to a classical Lagrangian-only
calculation albeit a small one. Numerical results confirm a reduc-
tion of the statistical noise as Npc is increased but with a reduced
impact of the results from the new hybrid method [99]. On the
other hand, these results indicate that the new hybrid algorithm is
stable and convergent. They also reveal the much-smoother results
for ap and Up produced by the Eulerian solver (see the profiles
ELM2Dp). Thus, this leaves hope that algorithm B, which includes a
specific consistent step, could be more efficient to tackle statistical
noise and act as an efficient VRT for the Lagrangian simulations.

For all its geometrical simplicity, the two-phase wall jet is an
interesting and challenging test case. In particular, it contains a
common feature of most particle-laden flows, namely the existence
of a particle front and regions where there are no particles at all.
This represents a difference with single-phase variable-density
flows where density changes between non-zero values whereas in
two-phase flow situations the particle (equivalent) density, aprp,
can truly go to zero inside the particle-depleted regions.

To conclude this subsection, it is seen that these new hybrid
formulations open opportunities to improve numerical simulations
of LSMs. With respect to this general objective, the version corre-
sponding to the algorithm B presents an interesting potential as it is
less connected to the choice of a specific Lagrangian stochastic
model. Therefore, these developments point to a new area worth
investigating in more detail and it is believed that the mathematical
toolbox is now ready for new practical formulations to be built.

5.4. Conclusions on the present numerical state-of-the-art

The numerical examples presented above were discussed in
correspondence with the objectives set forth in the introduction of
this section (see points (a)-(d)). The two industrial examples
illustrate that LSMs can be applied in a variety of situations and for

particle has a Gaussian random component sampled in an isotropic
distribution based on the inlet fluid turbulent kinetic energy.
Computations were performed on a uniform mesh with
Nx (cid:3) Ny1⁄4200 (cid:3) 40 cells.

First tests on the complete hybrid method have been obtained
with the two-phase model in Eq. (103). With this choice, there is a
two-way coupling between the Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers
and the direct influence of using a less-noisy estimation for 〈Up〉 can
be assessed. Results for the profiles of the particle volumetric
fraction are shown in Fig. 26 which corresponds to a hybrid
calculation with a given number of particles per cell (Npc 1⁄4 50 on
average). Three profiles are plotted on this figure: the first one
corresponds to results obtained with the classical hybrid approach
in which the particle phase is described only by the PDF approach
(referred to as LM2Dp) and the two predictions obtained with the
new hybrid method, one from the coupled Lagrangian solver
(referred to as HLM2Dp) and one from the coupled Eulerian solver
(referred to as EM2Dp).

with an average number of particles per cell equal to Npc 1⁄4 50 and results are shown at time T 1⁄4 5 s. The different profiles correspond to the classical Lagrangian approach for the
particle phase (referred to as LM2Dp), while results obtained with the new hybrid method are referred to as HLM2Dp (solution of the Lagrangian solver) and EM2Dp (solution of the
Eulerian solver). Note that, as the consistency conditions Eq. (108) are not enforced, the two predictions for ap from the hybrid method are not identical. Taken from Ref. [99].

a range of purposes. On the one hand, the standard LSM was used in
Section 5.1.2 in a complex-geometry situation with a more quan-
titative viewpoint: this means that the standard state-vector
Z 1⁄4 Zdyn 1⁄4 (xp,Up,Us) was selected and that calculations involved a
large number of particles (typically of the order of a few hundred
thousands). On the other hand, an extended LSM was developed in
section 5.2.2 in a complex-physics situation with a more qualitative
viewpoint: this means that many more variables were introduced
in the particle state-vector Z 1⁄4 (Zdyn,Zcomb) and that first compu-
tations were run with a reduced number of trajectories to investi-
gate the effects of the physical processes at play.

At the end of this section, a number of conclusions can be drawn.
They are organized into three classes corresponding to (i) best-
practice guidelines, (ii) areas that need to be consolidated, (iii)
new domains that call for further explorations.

(i) This category gathers the requirements to use consistent
operators for the interpolation of fluid fields to particle lo-
cations and particle statistics estimations (grid/particle in-
formation exchange), numerical schemes that yield the
correct physical limits when the characteristic timescales
vanish, and consistent fluid turbulence and Langevin-type of
models (or other types of stochastic models).

(ii) As mentioned, progress has been obtained by devising suit-
able numerical schemes. These schemes can be second-order
accurate in time within the flow domain. For stochastic
systems, this is already an achievement. Yet, the numerical
formulations of various boundary conditions (particularly,
wall boundary conditions) respecting this order of accuracy
need further works and validation. Furthermore, the analysis
of the numerical errors has isolated the separate contribu-
tions due to the deterministic, bias and statistical errors, but
a clearer picture of the relations between the corresponding
parameters (Dx, Dt and Npc), which would indicate the op-
timum choices of one such parameter with respect to the
others, has yet to be revealed. At the moment, this remains
an empirical procedure.

(iii) In the category of new areas to explore, new hybrid methods
seem to present great potential. From the description given
in Section 5.3, it is clear that we are still groping to bring out a
definitive formulation. Furthermore, this new hybrid method
is actually only one example within the large class of ‘hybrid
methods’. The hybrid formulation considered in this section
consists in trying to combine PDF and Moment approaches to
describe the particle phase at every point in the whole flow
domain. Yet, hybrid methods are perhaps more easily un-
derstood with a domain separation in mind: one description
is applied in one part of the domain while another descrip-
tion is applied in the rest of the domain. This is what is done
in hybrid methods where hydrodynamical and molecular
descriptions are used for some micro-fluidic systems: one
part of the fluid flow is simulated with the NaviereStokes
equation while another part is simulated with the Boltzmann
equation to capture molecular effects. In that sense, only one
description exists within one area and these approaches
should perhaps be called ‘coupling methods’ with the diffi-
culty of handling the correct fluxes from different de-
scriptions through the separating interfaces.

One interesting development could be to combine both notions
of hybrid methods, starting from the ideas outlined in Section 5.3.
Indeed, it is the author's opinion that LSMs have now demonstrated
their great interest for complex-physics issues. Yet, are they needed
everywhere and all the time? If we go back to the industrial
it is seen that a detailed
example discussed in Section 5.2.2,

description of the physics involved is particularly needed in the
burner area to capture the near-flame zone as accurately as
possible. However, is such a detailed description needed further
downstream and in the whole domain? In these regions, a
simplified and more computationally-efficient approach could be
sufficient. Thus, a transition from a physically more-advanced PDF
model to a coarser Moment approach could be of great practical
interest. This could be achieved by extending the hybrid method of
Section 5.3. More precisely, one could introduce a Moment
approach for the particle phase which would yield a description for
the kinetic tensor, say 〈up,iup,j〉EM (where the superscript EM stands
for Eulerian Model). Then, in the equations corresponding to the
Moment description of the particle phase, Eq. (107), the particle
kinetic tensor entering this system could be taken as an interpo-
lated value between the value provided by the Lagrangian solver

with 0 (cid:4) c (cid:4) 1appears as a fraction that governs the proportion
given to the source of information provided by the Lagrangian
calculation. By tuning c to a very small value, Eq. (107) degenerate
naturally toward a Moment-only description of the particle phase.
It is hoped that research work will be devoted to investigating these
directions.

6. New modeling roads and new stochastic models

The theoretical framework in Section 3, the outline of the
physics of classical models in Section 4 and the computational
examples in Section 5 give a comprehensive picture of standard
LSMs for disperse two-phase flows. However, new modeling ideas
are pushing the boundaries of current LSMs and, whereas the ex-
tensions developed for LES-based simulations will be addressed in
Section 7, some of these attempts are presented in this section.
These ideas are helpful to answer four typical questions about
LSMs:

1. At this stage, it is possible to confuse LSMs for Langevin Sto-
chastic Methods since only Langevin-type of models have been
considered. Does it mean that a single Langevin model is always
used to simulate the velocity of the fluid seen?

2. In Section 3, it was indicated that simulating a large number of
trajectories is equivalent to handling the PDF equation in a weak
sense. Therefore, once a model is formulated, one can manipu-
late the PDF (this is the PDF point of view) or the trajectories
(this is the trajectory point of view). However, for the elabora-
tion of practical stochastic models, is it simpler to model first the
PDF equation and obtain the corresponding trajectories after or
to model the trajectories first and derive the PDF equation af-
terward? In other words, is it simpler to follow the trajectory or
the PDF point of view to devise new models?

3. At the moment, LSMs have been presented in the context of one-
particle PDF and with an emphasis on fluid-particle interactions.
Can LSMs address situations where particleeparticle in-
teractions are important, such as collisions and agglomeration?
4. Even if two-way coupling is accounted for, as in Section 4.4, are
LSMs limited to relatively dilute systems? Do they remain valid
when particles form clusters that can block parts of the fluid
flow domain?

The examples presented in this section are organized in corre-
spondence with these concerns. They are mostly taken from recent
developments dedicated to modeling inertial and colloidal particle

deposition issues. The loose terminology of ‘deposition issues’
should be understood here as referring to the ensemble of phe-
nomena which gathers deposition, resuspension, agglomeration
and clogging. As the analyses of the physical phenomena involved
and of the fundamental interactions at play have been presented in
recent works [4,13], they are not repeated here and interested
readers are referred to these articles for comprehensive discus-
sions. Yet, these issues, and in particular the need to address both
dilute systems (such as for mono-layer deposits) and dense systems
(such as for multi-layer deposits), have challenged classical LSMs
and have acted as incentives for taking new modeling steps. In the
following, new light is shed on these developments for the purpose
of illustrating the answers to the questions listed above.

6.1. Accounting for the statistical signature of coherent structures

6.1.1. A two-stage model for particle transport in near-wall regions

The phenomenon of particle deposition involves two major
steps: a transport step, where particles are transported toward wall
surfaces by fluid turbulent motions, and an attachment step, where
adhesion forces take over as particles interact with wall surfaces
(see detailed descriptions in Ref. [4]). The attachment step will be
discussed in the following section with the formulation of suitable
boundary conditions and, in the present section, we are dealing
with the transport step. This means that we are considering models
for the velocity of the fluid seen for particle transport in near-wall
boundary layers, which are thin zones where fluid flows exhibit
strong inhomogeneities [9]. Inertial particles can filter out the rapid
changes of fluid velocities in these regions but colloidal particles
respond to the sharp gradients of fluid characteristic statistics and,
in the latter case, accurate models for the velocity of the fluid seen
are important. In the rest of this section, we discuss models for
colloidal particles but, for the sake of simplicity, without any CTE
effects.

The most traveled modeling road follows the Langevin path.
Many models have been proposed along that line to simulate par-
ticle deposition but, unfortunately, few have been carefully vali-
dated with respect to the known variations of fluid moments in the
near-wall region (which should be retrieved in the tracer-particle
limit). Thus, in this category, we mainly refer to two models
which were developed to capture turbulent boundary layers down
to the wall, including the viscous sublayer [101,42]. In these models,
special developments had to be implemented, in particular elliptic-
relaxation closures to obtain non-local expressions of the fluid
pressure [101,42]. In contrast to this Langevin approach, another
road has been proposed. This new approach was introduced in
Ref. [102] and further details were presented in the general context
of particle fouling in Ref. [4]. In the following, we restrict ourselves
to the main ideas of the model formulation.

6.1.1.1. Leading principles. The construction of this new modeling
approach is based on two leading principles which arise from two
remarks:

(i) If we leave out the specific details of each model, the main
characteristic of Langevin-based approaches is that a single
stochastic diffusion process is considered to model the fluid
velocity seen. In more general terms, we can say that we are
trying to capture a physically-complex situation with one
model. Not surprisingly, this model is likely to have a com-
plex form. Then, why not try to capture such complex situ-
ations by a series of interrelated stochastic models, each of
which would retain a simple form? The underlying attempt
is to capture complexity not with one (elaborated) model but
through the interplay of several (elementary) models.

(ii) There is now a wealth of experimental and numerical in-
vestigations on the role of fluid coherent structures for par-
ticleefluid interactions in near-wall regions [50e52,49,103].
These coherent structures are ‘smoothed out’ in RANS ap-
proaches or in Langevin-based formulations which are
basically structure-less models. On the other hand, as LSMs
handle instantaneous fluid velocities, other possibilities can
be imagined. For instance, why not start from a simplified
picture of a fluid flow in terms of structures (extracted from
previous DNS) and explicitly model the succession of fluid
coherent structures encountered by particles along their
trajectory?

The combination of these two principles has acted as a guideline
to develop new formulations which are illustrated by the example
presented now.

6.1.1.2. A two-stage stochastic model. The model
for coherent
structures is implemented only in the boundary layer (see Fig. 27),
defined as the region between the wall and a distance equal to xbl
which is usually taken as xþ
21⁄2100; 500(cid:7) depending on the value of
bl
the Reynolds number based on the velocity and length scales in the
þ
bulk of the flow. The superscript
indicates that variables have been
made non-dimensional using wall units, that is based on d 1⁄4 nf/ut
and ut the wall-friction velocity [9]. The model is limited to vari-
ables associated to the wallenormal direction while,
for the
tangential and transverse directions as well as outside the bound-
ary layer, a classical Langevin model is applied. This means that the
stochastic process simulated by the two-stage model is made up by
(xp,Up,Us) where xp is the distance to the wall, Up the particle ve-
locity and Us the velocity of the fluid seen in the wallenormal di-
rection (this notation allows a clear distinction with the
corresponding variables in sample space, (yp,Vp,Vs), which will be
used in Section 6.1.2). The boundary layer is decomposed into two
regions: the inner zone and the outer zone. The inner zone is
defined as the region between the wall and an interface located at a
distance xþ
izwhile the outer zone is defined as the region located
between xþ
izand the upper end of the boundary layer xþ
bl(see Fig. 27).
Typical values of xþ
izare in the range [5,40]. Therefore, the inner zone
corresponds essentially to the viscous sublayer and the outer zone
refers basically to the logarithmic region.

In practice, the location of the interface between the inner and
outer zones is fixed for each particle but changes randomly from
one particle to the other [102]. As a result, a buffer region is created
for the resulting statistics. Fluid structures are only considered in
the outer zone of the boundary layer and, furthermore, only three
structures are retained: sweep (fluid motion toward the wall),
ejection (fluid motion away from the wall) and a structure-less

where a model has to be proposed for the velocity of the fluid seen
which, as indicated above, will be modeled as the velocity of a fluid
particle (no CTE are considered here).

In the outer zone, a stochastic process S(t) is introduced to
represent the random changes between the different structures
and is referred to as the ‘parent process’. From the above discussion,
it is seen that S(t) can take three values which are defined as S(t) 1⁄4 1
for the sweep phase, S(t) 1⁄4 2 for the diffusion phase and S(t) 1⁄4 3 for
the ejection phase. The trajectories of S(t) jump between these

another phase j (with ksj). S(t) is modeled by a continuous-time
Markov chain (loosely speaking, a compound Poisson process)
and the evolution in time of the trajectories is governed by the
transition matrix M(Dt), whose components represent the proba-
bility to be in the state j at time t þ Dt conditioned on the fact that

From the structure of the transition matrix, it appears that a
particle in a sweep or ejection phase can only jump to the diffusion
phase (as M1,3 1⁄4 M3,1 1⁄4 0) while a particle in a diffusion phase has
equal probability to jump to the ejection or to the sweep phases (as
M2,1 1⁄4 M2,3). In the expressions above, ts represents the character-
istic life time of the sweep/ejection phases, which are thus mirror
structures, and td stands for the characteristic life time of the
diffusion phase.

In the outer zone, where the three structures co-exist, the model

for the velocity of the fluid seen Us has the following form

(112)

where Ks,iz 1⁄4 Ks,iz(xp) is the diffusion coefficient in the inner zone, T
the same time scale as in the outer zone and As,int 1⁄4 As,int(xp) a non-
homogeneous term which plays a role akin to a pressure-gradient
(to counterbalance the sharp decrease in the wallenormal kinetic
energy 〈u2
〉 and avoid spurious fluid-particle accumulation). For a
s
later easier use in Section 6.1.2, a more compact notation is intro-
the diffusion models, which are written as
duced for
dUs 1⁄4 As,ozdt þ Ks,ozdW for the diffusion phase in the outer zone and
dUs 1⁄4 As,izdt þ Ks,izdW for the diffusion model in the inner zone.

In the outer zone, the new description brought by the two-stage
model is best illustrated by plotting a typical particle trajectory, as
in Fig. 28 where the characteristic features of the sweep, ejection
and diffusion phases are evident.

As particles encounter a random succession of structures in the
outer zone, the velocity of the fluid seen along a particle trajectory
1⁄2k(cid:7)
switches to different values at times t
SðtÞ1⁄4j, inducing discontinuities.
These discontinuities can be avoided by introducing relaxation
terms with very short time scales but, for the sake of simplicity,
these extensions are not considered here as they do not change the
physical content of the model. In a symmetrical manner, when a
1⁄2k(cid:7)
particle enters the diffusion phase, that is at times t
SðtÞ1⁄42 (with
k 1⁄4 1, 3), the velocity of the fluid seen is then re-initialized by
sampling a new value in the stationary distribution corresponding
to the diffusion-phase only.

It is seen that very simple models have been retained for each
structure, in line with the first principle set forth in the preceding
paragraph. Extensions can easily be imagined, for example by
replacing the fixed value Vstruct by a random variable between
positive bounds. On the other hand,
implementing a spatial-
dependent function Vstruct(xp) would be more complex as a net
flux would be created which would have to be balanced by the
addition of pressure-gradient-like terms, requiring careful imple-
mentations. Yet, numerical simulations indicated that the two-
stage model, under its present form, is already able to capture
interesting characteristics of turbulent boundary layers [102].

As the model is meant for particle deposition, its typical result is
the prediction of the deposition rate as a function of particle inertia.
Such a result is shown in Fig. 29 and compared to a compilation of
experimental data from Ref. [104] which reveals a spread in the
experimental measurements. The deposition rate kphas the
dimension of velocity and is calculated as kp 1⁄4 Fp=Cp where Fp (in
kg/(m2 s)) is the deposited mass flux and Cp (in kg/m3) the particle
concentration above the surface. In Fig. 29, the values of the

where Vstruct is a parameter representing the typical velocity of the
sweep and ejection phases while T is the timescale and Ks,oz the
diffusion coefficient entering the OrnsteineUhlenbeck process
which models the velocity of the fluid seen within the diffusion
phase. All three parameters scale with the corresponding wall
units.

As no structures in the wallenormal direction are assumed to
exist (or are regarded as too weak) in the immediate vicinity of the
wall, the inner zone is described as a structure-less region and the
velocity of the fluid seen is modeled by a diffusion process

ber and are given in Ref. [106]), numerical results have been ob-
tained to evaluate the influence of temperature gradients in the gas
flow on particle deposition rates. These results are shown in Fig. 30
and it is seen that present LSMs reproduce correctly the experi-
mental trends. Calculations were also run for very small values of
x10(cid:2)4), as a numerical check since the analytical

that limit [107].

Note that the situation is far more uncertain for thermophoresis
in liquids. Indeed, there is no well-established molecular kinetic
theory for liquids on which to base a rigorous theoretical analysis
and even the sign of the Soret coefficient is unknown. Indeed,
whereas the Soret coefficient is always positive in gases, there are
cases showing an inversion in liquids (the Soret coefficient can
change sign) depending on the solution conditions. For example,
such unexpected behavior is reported in Refs. [108,109] and the
expression of the Soret coefficient in liquids is therefore an open
question which is the subject of current research (see in particular
the various modeling attempts in Refs. [110,24,111,23] and molec-
ular dynamics investigations [112]). It is interesting to note that
current efforts to provide closed formulas for ST in liquids are based
more often on thermodynamical reasoning involving DLVO-like
forces
than on microscopic
developments.

As mentioned, the interest of the two-stage model described
above goes beyond this application of particle deposition and a
more general perspective is now proposed.

Such a result is very classical in the study of particle deposition,
though the assessment of the fluid limit is unfortunately often
overlooked. Further details can be found in specific articles [105]
and in a review analysis [49]. In the context of the present article,
our purpose is less to investigate particle deposition as detailed
reviews exist [49,4] than to bring out general modeling issues. One
such issue is the ability of LSMs to remain viable when more
complex physical descriptions need to be accounted for. This was
illustrated throughout Section 5 for classical LSMs (‘(cid:2)a la Langevin’)
and this remains valid for the present example of a non-Langevin
formulation. More realistic boundary conditions are addressed in
Section 6.1.2 but we illustrate a first step with thermophoresis
effects.

Thermophoresis was introduced in Section 2.3 and is an
important phenomenon which finds applications in several areas of
engineering. For example, it has been studied for some time in the
context of the transfer of radioactive aerosols generated in a nuclear
safety accident and has been recognized as a relevant factor in
reactor safety assessment. Another application is in the semi-
conductor industry where thermophoresis is used to repel unde-
sired particles and prevent their deposition. On the other hand,
thermophoresis is also used to favor deposition in order to form a
thin film on a substrate of lower temperature. One example con-
cerns the fabrication of optical fibers where fine particles created
by gas phase reactions are transported due to thermophoresis and
an application of nanoparticle agglomeration is discussed in Sec-
tion 6.2.2.

We are here concerned with its practical implementation in the
two-stage deposition model as an illustration of the general
methodology to include complex-physics phenomena. Drawing on
Section 2.3, thermo-phoresis is accounted for with an extra force in
the particle momentum equation, as in Eq. (30), and the issue is to
express the Soret coefficient ST. For thermophoresis in gases, the
situation has been well addressed and a number of theoretical
predictions are available based on gas kinetic theory (see Ref. [20]).

6.1.1.3. The statistical signature of coherent structures. The guiding
ideas behind the previous model form a description which is in-
termediate between the level of description of DNS calculations
and the one of averaged closure laws, while offering the possibility
to combine both aspects. On the one hand, DNS are microscopic
approaches where the interactions between all the degrees of
freedom are explicitly computed and where fluid coherent struc-
tures can be exactly calculated (with the help of eduction tech-
niques or the selection of criteria to define these structures): this
represents ‘the geometrical point of view’ where spatial coherence
is emphasized. On the other hand, averaged models are macro-
scopic approaches where the combined effects of the fluid coherent
structures are summed up or, at best, implicitly contained in the
constitutive relations retained for the evolution of fluid statistics.
Although acting at a mesoscopic level, Langevin-based models do
not consider explicitly coherent structures. In that sense, this latter
class represents ‘the statistical point of view’ where resulting ef-
fects on statistical quantities are directly modeled.

However, LSMs offer the possibility to unite the geometrical and
statistical descriptions. This is embodied by the two-stage model
above and this opens the possibility to mimic the effects of
coherent structures and, in that sense, to account for the statistical
signature of these coherent structures on particle statistics. While
some doubts have been expressed on the actual role of such
coherent structures for the analysis of fluid turbulence properties
[113,9], as well as on the possibility to come up with clear-cut
detection criteria, it is believed that these ideas constitute a new
road worth traveling on for issues such as the particle preferential-
concentration effect. This direction is taken up again in Section 6.4.
Finally, the two-stage model demonstrates that non-Langevin
models can easily be built in LSMs, providing an answer to ques-
tion 1 in the introduction of Section 6. For the development of
similar ideas, the interest of using the trajectory point of view is
now underlined by considering the expression of the two-stage
model in sample space.

6.1.2. PDF equations and the formulation of boundary conditions

The equivalence between the SDEs of a stochastic diffusion
process and FokkerePlanck equations in sample space is well-

from statistical physics for the separate treatment of the pressure-
gradient and viscous terms, from which a Langevin model for the
velocity of fluid particles was derived [114].

These results can lead us to believe that developing a model
either in terms of trajectories or in terms of the PDF equation in
sample space amounts to the same effort. The specific model for
particle transport in near-wall regions introduced in the preceding
section illustrates that this is not necessarily so. This model was
developed directly in terms of the trajectories of the process, from
which the physics involved and the key characteristics can be easily
grasped. The formulations of the corresponding PDF equation and
of the boundary conditions are now developed. It is to be noted that
these PDF formulations represent new elements that complement
the previous description and the above-mentioned works [102,4].

6.1.2.1. PDF equations for the two-stage deposition model. Let us first
consider the case of a fixed location of the interface between the
inner and outer zones of the model. In the inner zone, the velocity
of the fluid seen is described by a single stochastic diffusion process
and the pdf of the process, p(t;yp,Vp,Vs), follows a classical Fok-
kerePlanck equation

However, the situation is more complicated in the outer zone
when the model of the fluid coherent structures takes over. To
derive the PDF equation in such a non-classical situation, mathe-
matical developments require to go back to the definition of the
generator of the stochastic process, say L , from which the forward
Kolmogorov equation, which is the PDF equation we are looking for,
is obtained as [30,27].

In the general case where the separation between the inner and
outer zones is a random variable attached to each solid particle and
uniformly sampled in the interval 1⁄2xþ
(cid:7), the expression of
the PDF is even more intricate. If we refer to the solution of Eq. (115)
valid in the inner zone as piz and to the solution of Eq. (117) valid in
the outer zone as poz, then we have that p 1⁄4 aozpoz þ (1 (cid:2) aoz)piz,
where aoz(xp) is the probability for particles at a location xp to be in
the outer zone. Therefore, the separation between the two zones
makes up a fuzzy interface between the regions corresponding to
different descriptions of the velocity of the fluid seen.

6.1.2.2. Boundary conditions. In sample space, the complete model
compounded by Eqs. (115) and (117) must be supplemented by
wall-boundary conditions. These boundary conditions are essen-
tially associated to Eq. (115) which governs the process in the inner
zone. This is another area where formulations in terms of PDFs can
be trickier than the ones expressed in terms of trajectories. In most
hydrodynamical models developed for particle deposition, a simple
boundary condition is often assumed where each particle touching
the wall
is taken as being permanently deposited (and thus
removed from the calculation). This amounts to imposing
p(t;0,Vp,Vs) 1⁄4 0 at the wall, which translates an absorbing boundary
condition. Another simple condition is to assume perfect elastic
bouncing. The actual expression of this reflecting boundary con-
dition is worked out by writing the corresponding FokkerePlanck
equation, Eq. (115) as

where the vector J is the so-called probability current [15,30] (the

Then, the reflecting boundary condition consists in writing that
the net flux across the boundary is zero (this sum of the incoming
and outgoing fluxes is zero), so that we have n$JdU 1⁄4 0, where n is
the wallenormal unit vector and JdU the probability current at the
boundary, which is the wall itself.

However, in order to obtain realistic conditions, it is necessary to
account for the important forces, due to interface-chemistry effects
(the so-called DLVO forces [116]), acting in the immediate vicinity
of the wall (especially for liquid media) and for surface roughness
which can modify the magnitude of these forces. These effects have
been considered in detail in previous reviews [4,13] where it was
shown that they can be introduced through suitable wall-boundary
conditions. As a result of these analyses, the particle boundary
conditions can be expressed in terms of the energy barrier E that
represents the energetic step that a particle must overcome in or-
der to reach the wall where attractive forces are dominant [4]. Thus,
for a particle impacting the wall with a wallenormal velocity Up,
this is easily formulated as

(123)

When the discrete particle deposits, the velocity of the fluid
seen is put to zero while it is reflected when the particle rebounds.
The energy barrier E is dependent on the incoming particle diam-
eter and on parameters representing the physical variables at play
in the DLVO forces, such as particle and wall zeta potentials,
Hamaker constant, ionic strength (if in a liquid medium), etc. (see
detailed descriptions in Refs. [116,4]). It depends also on the wall-
surface roughness which can significantly lower the energy bar-
rier, depending on the wall geometrical arrangements of the local
wall surface-element immediately facing each incoming particle.
As a result, the energy barrier is a random variable, whose PDF pðE Þ
(with E the possible values of E in sample space) is governed by
these parameters and, especially, surface roughness. Combined to
the model for particle transport described above in Section 6.1.1, the
implementation of these boundary conditions has allowed both
hydrodynamical and interface-chemistry effects to be included in a
single approach for particle deposition and resuspension
[117,118,4].

The formulation given in Eq. (123) follows the trajectory point of
view and is written in terms of the wallenormal kinetic energy of
each incoming particle by sampling a value of the energy barrier to
apply the boundary conditions. This leads to a simple and natural
implementation of the conditions in Eq. (123). On the other hand,
the expression of the same conditions in terms of the PDF
p(t;0,Vp,Vs) at the wall is less trivial.

We can start by considering the case of a fixed (or given)
energy barrier E. For this situation, the complete boundary con-
dition is a combination of the two ‘elementary’ ones (absorbing
and reflecting) given above and is expressed by (with the
convention that the wallenormal unit vector is pointing toward
the wall, so that impacting particles have a positive wallenormal
velocity)

When the energy barrier is a random variable, the situation is
depicted in Fig. 32 with the particle velocity and energy barrier
distributions at the wall.

Still using the same convention for the direction of the wall-
enormal unit vector, then for a given value Vp the probability to
deposit is given by

The expression of the PDF boundary conditions is sketched in
Fig. 31 to help reveal the combination of the two individual con-
ditions to make up the complete formulation.

It is worth pointing out that these boundary conditions are
already non-standard ones in the study of FokkerePlanck equa-
tions where, as indicated in several textbooks, detailed analysis of
boundary conditions is rather scarce [30,15,119].

When the energy barrier is negligible (say pðE Þ 1⁄4 dðE Þ), then
we have that cVp; bðVpÞx1which corresponds to a pure absorbing
condition (all
incoming particles deposit) and to having
p(t;0,Vp,Vs) 1⁄4 0 at the wall. For the opposite limit of very high en-
ergy barriers, then we have that cVp; bðVpÞx0and thus that the

probability to rebound tends to 1, which corresponds to having a
pure reflecting condition (all incoming particles rebound back into
the flow domain) and to having a net zero probability current
through the interface. Apart from these two asymptotic cases
which are already not so easy to tackle, the complete boundary
conditions are expressed by the combination in Eq. (126). It appears
therefore that these conditions make an attempt to solve the
complete PDF equations, Eqs. (115), (117) and (126), quite a chal-
lenging task.

It is worth emphasizing that, for practical situations, the simple
conditions mentioned above (either zero-Dirichlet or zero-flux, for
all Vp), are actually simplistic and can fail to describe properly the
interplay between hydrodynamical and chemical effects that must
be captured to obtain realistic simulations of colloidal particle
deposition. This is demonstrated by the results plotted in Figs. 33
and 34. In Fig. 33, the deposition rates of 25 nm latex particles on
a flat and smooth sapphire wall surface are displayed at various pH
conditions when the latex particles are only subjected to Brownian
motion in water. The experimental results are provided in Ref. [120]
and made non-dimensional by dividing with the maximum rate
kp,max, while the numerical results are detailed in Ref. [4]. It is seen
that, when pH (cid:4) 6, a non-zero deposition rate (nearly equal to the
maximum value kpxkp;max) is obtained but that a zero deposition
rate is observed at pH > 6. At pH > 6, the electrostatic interactions in
the DLVO forces become important and lead to the appearance of an
energy barrier, whereas at pH (cid:4) 6 they remain very low so that no
energy barrier is present. In the conditions of the experiment, the
energy barrier E at pH > 6 is high enough to prevent the latex
particles from reaching the wall surface (thus the term ‘repulsive
conditions’ in Fig. 33) while at pH (cid:4) 6, the energy barrier is negli-
gible, Ex0, so that all particles can deposit when impacting the
surface (thus the term ‘attractive conditions’ in Fig. 33). Note that,
as the temperature of the liquid medium is constant, the kinetic
energy of the latex particles, due to Brownian effects, is indepen-
dent of the pH of the solution which explains that the deposition
rate is constant at pH (cid:4) 6. The numerical results in Fig. 33 are ob-
tained with the two-stage model described in Section 6.1.1 and
using the boundary conditions in Eq. (123). In the present situation,
the implementation of these boundary conditions are very simple
for particle trajectories as the energy barrier is a constant and it is
worth noting that they retain the same form over the whole range

of pH (only the input value of E changes). In a PDF formulation, this
would imply to switch from one boundary condition to the other
depending on the value of the pH but could still be tractable.

The situation becomes more difficult in a realistic case. This is
illustrated in Fig. 34 which represents the normalized deposition
rate of 820 nm polystyrene particles on a polymer (PMMA) sub-
strate as a function of the solution chemical conditions, here the
ionic strength. The experiment is described in Ref. [121] while the
details of the simulations can be found in Ref. [4]. In the present
case, wall surface roughness plays an important role and this is
revealed by the gradual decrease of the experimental deposition
rates observed in Fig. 34 in contrast with the one-step profile in
Fig. 33. As for the previous situation, when simulations are run
without accounting for surface roughness, a simple zero/one profile
is obtained (see the red-line profile in Fig. 34) which poorly re-
produces experimental values. It is thus essential to capture the
effects of surface roughness which can reduce the values of the
energy barrier seen by impacting particles. In the trajectory point of
view, this is done in a rather straightforward manner by allowing
the energy barrier to become a random variable. This means that, in
the Monte Carlo formulation, the geometry of the small wall sur-
face element seen by each impacting particle is reconstructed using
hemispheric asperities randomly distributed to describe surface
roughness [117]. This direct extension allows naturally the energy
barrier to become a random variable correlated with the variables
already present in the particle state-vector. Then, the boundary
conditions in Eq. (123) are applied with the corresponding value of
E generated by the surface-roughness model outlined above
(where E is a sample value of E, indicating that the complete sto-
chastic process handled by the model is now Z 1⁄4 (xp,Up,Us,E)). The
Monte Carlo simulations yield directly the outcome of this complex
competition between the random processes governing deposition
and rebound and, from the results displayed in Fig. 34, it is seen that
a gradual decrease of the overall deposition rate is obtained when
the ionic force is decreased, in line with the experimental obser-
vations. Other validations and examples are detailed in Ref. [4]. The
important conclusion on these aspects is that, in order to reproduce
realistic and experimentally-observed trends, boundary conditions
must account for the intricate interplay between rebound and
deposition and capture accurately the effects of particle kinetic
energy, interface-chemistry and wall roughness. In that case, this is
a challenge for PDF formulations. Yet, it is worth pointing out that,
in several application-oriented problems, predicting a strictly zero
deposition rate instead of a non-zero value is of no engineering
value whatsoever.

Furthermore, when particle resuspension is taken into account,
the issue becomes even more intricate as particles can be deposited
on the wall surface for a certain duration, which is then a random
variable, before being re-entrained in the flow domain (see a recent
review on progress on particle resuspension and, especially, on
modeling aspects in Ref. [13]). For all these aspects, it is essential to
build a modeling framework that remains open so that new models
can be (relatively) easily integrated. With regard to this require-
ment, the trajectory point of view clearly stands out as the most
convenient formulation.

6.1.2.3. Summary. With the example of the two-stage deposition
model, it appears that expressions in sample space, cf. Eq. (117),
can be more intricate than in terms of trajectories. In practice, this
suggests that the road toward non-Langevin, or non-Fokkere-
Planck, models is best followed with the trajectory point of view.
Furthermore, the developments discussed in this section indicate
that formulations in sample space can limit the physical content.
For instance, too-simple boundary conditions (pure absorption or
pure reflection) can restrict a model to situations of just academic

interest. This was exemplified by showing how a PDF description
can become quite involved while we were only dealing with the
description of chemically-inert particle dynamics. This is of direct
relevance to two-phase reactive flows where the description of
particle dynamics needs to be completed with new variables,
bringing additional complexity to the system to be modeled.

It is also worth noting that the present example is a case where
the dimension of the sample space remains low (actually, it is a
three-dimensional space). Yet, solving directly the PDF equation
appears as difficult. This demonstrates that the interest of the tra-
jectory point of view is not limited to high-dimensional sample
spaces. The underlying message should not be mistaken: in a weak
sense, formulations of the same model in terms of trajectory or in
terms of the PDF are equivalent. However, it is clear that the tra-
jectory road offers more possibilities to build new models in
complex situations such as reactive two-phase flows. This provides
an answer to question 2 in the introduction of Section 6.

6.2. Particle collisions and agglomeration

At first sight, considering particle agglomeration (which in-
cludes the issue of particle collisions) in a section devoted to new
modeling approaches is surprising. Indeed, the formulation of the
population balance equation (PBE) goes back to Smoluchowski
(1916) and is referred to as ‘Smoluchowski coagulation equation’
(note that, though they are sometimes confused, the ‘Smo-
luchowski equation’ is related to particle diffusion under a poten-
tial). For our present concern, ‘agglomeration’, ‘coagulation’ and
‘coalescence’ designate the same process by which two colliding
particles stick together to form a new particle. The treatment of
collisions itself goes further back to the foundation of kinetic theory
and to the celebrated Boltzmann equation (1872) which has been
the basis of kinetic approaches ever since.

Thus, why this section? First of all, the connection between
these deterministic equations and particle stochastic systems is not
always well known, although some of these models have been
studied for some time in the mathematical community (see a
recent article [122] for a clear account of the historical de-
velopments of stochastic particle models for particle collisions and
a slightly older one [123] for a presentation of similar attempts for
particle agglomeration). Recent results on the combined effects of
particle collision/agglomeration are also worth describing. Second,
in the context of the present article on LSMs, it is important to
indicate how particleeparticle direct interactions, which corre-
sponds to close-range interactions or ‘collisions’, are included in the
framework of one-particle PDF descriptions (long-range parti-
cleeparticle interactions are typically hydrodynamical influences
and are not considered here as they relate mostly to local back-
effects of particles on the fluid flow). In that respect, it is some-
times believed that accounting for particle collisions represents a
difficult issue for LSMs but it will be shown that LSMs offer a natural
setting for these effects which, furthermore, allows generalizations,
such as accounting for chemical reaction mechanisms, agglomer-
ation and fragmentation, etc., to be easily included. These aspects
are related to question 3 in the introduction of Section 6.

The equation is written for the distribution function f(t;yp,Vp,dp)
which retains only particle location, velocity and diameter (or
volume) in the particle state vector. For molecules undergoing free
flights and collisions, the Boltzmann equation is undoubtedly the
reference framework. For particles (either solid particles or drop-
lets) carried in a fluid flow, its extension leads to the Williams
equation, particularly used for sprays [125].

The gain and loss terms in Eq. (128) correspond to the result of
possible collisions with all other particles and are expressed as
sums over potential collisional partners whose velocity before the
collision event is written Vc,p. In the integrals in Eq. (128), S 2
denotes the unit sphere in R3 and e is a unit vector on the unit
sphere S 2 representing the orientation of the collision event. The
specific details of the collision event are expressed through the
collision kernel B(Vp,Vc,p,e) which involves the collision cross-
section and, in kinetic theory, is given by

which states that, upon collision, the velocities of the colliding

The molecular chaos assumption is central in the kinetic theory
of gases and the distribution function f in the Boltzmann equation is
actually the one-particle marginal density of the N-particle distri-
bution. It is worth underlying that the notion of molecular chaos
plays also an important role in the analysis of the stochastic particle
systems used to describe the collisional process (see below) and in
the connection between the one-particle marginal density derived
from the N-particle density of the stochastic model and the solution
of the Boltzmann equation. In this context, it is referred to as the
‘propagation of chaos’ property and is formulated as

fied at t 1⁄4 0, then it holds at t > 0, which allows f to be identified
with the one-particle marginal density of the stochastic particle
system f 1⁄4 limN/þ∞p
ðt; V1Þ. This point is well introduced and
discussed in Ref. [122]. Such a property helps to understand that it
still makes sense to apply what is basically a N-particle model
(where particles or samples interact) in a one-particle PDF model.
Note that the propagation of chaos was already referred to in the
general framework in Section 3 when McKean stochastic differen-
tial equations were discussed.

It is seen that the effects of particle collisions are expressed by
two main characteristics: first, the selection of an appropriate

average over all directions) and, second, by the determination of
the elementary collision event given by the transformation re-
lations in Eq. (130). From these relations, it is also clear that the
mass of each particle is preserved and that the total number of
particles, as well as the momentum and kinetic energy (due to
elastic bouncing) are conserved. Therefore, collisions are basically
acting to redistribute kinetic energy between particles (this is the
process referred to as ‘thermalization’).

6.2.1.2. Stochastic particle systems for collision events. We consider
now stochastic particle systems where N particles interact through
a random interaction mechanism. A pedagogical presentation of
such models can be found in Wagner's article [122] and in related
works [126e129]. These stochastic particle systems have several
merits: (a) they illustrate the basics physics at play; (b) they provide
information on fluctuations in macroscopic quantities (for finite N);
(c) they motivate convergence studies and provide solutions to the
Boltzmann equation; (d) they pave the way to numerical algo-
rithms and practical formulations (see Section 6.2.2); (e) they allow
extensions, for example agglomeration, fragmentation or other
complex phenomena linked to particle collisions, to be included in
a relatively straightforward manner.

Here, we present the main result following [126] and, to antic-
ipate slightly on practical formulations and on the Direct Simula-
tion Monte Carlo (DSMC) method discussed in Section 6.2.2, we
consider the homogeneous case (it will be seen that this forms the

basis of the collision step in DSMC methods). Then, the N particles
contained in a small volume V interact through the following
generalized Poisson process which describes the evolution of the N-
particle state vector made up by the N particle velocities

We refer to the (mostly mathematical) literature for further
analysis of these stochastic particle systems and their connection to
the solution, or the approximation, of the Boltzmann equation (for

Boltzmann equation).

count of the changes in the population of clusters. This explains the
current name of population-balance equation [130] with which this
equation is often referred to.

From a physical point of view, agglomeration refers to the pro-
cess by which two particles (or clusters) interact and, through
‘collisions’, bind to form a larger particle or cluster. Therefore,

Contrary to the derivation of the Boltzmann equation which
preceded other formulations, the expression of the corresponding
kinetic equation for the distribution f(t;yp,Vp,qp) (where qp denotes
the sample space variable corresponding to the particle volume wp)
in the agglomeration process has only been proposed not long ago
[131]. Its formulation has been used in recent works [132,133] and
can be written as

the product of the classical collision kernel given in Eq. (129) and
the probability that a collision event yields an agglomerate. Other
kernels can be considered, depending on the assumptions made on
particle motion. This point is discussed below.

Similarly to the collisional process, it is seen that particle
agglomeration is
the
agglomeration kernel K and the agglomeration event man-
ifested by the transformation relations in Eq. (138). However,
the mass of each particle is not preserved in the elementary
event and it is clear that, if momentum is conserved, the total
number of particles is decreasing in time as well as the total
particle kinetic energy.

6.2.1.4. Stochastic particle systems for agglomeration. If the kinetic
formulation of the agglomeration process reveals itself to be
intricate in Eqs. (140) and (141), the formulation of the corre-
sponding stochastic particle system is a straightforward adaptation
of the one already introduced for the collision process. Presentation
and analysis of this stochastic particle system can be found for
instance in Refs. [134e136,127].

With the same hypotheses introduced for the Smoluchowski
equation, we consider N particles in a small volume V whose in-
teractions are modeled by the following generalized Poisson pro-
cess which describes the evolution of the N-particle state vector
made up by the N particle masses (or volumes) and velocities

systems
Using the stochastic particle systems developed for the collision
and the agglomeration processes as guidelines, it is clear that ex-
tensions can easily be constructed. This represents one of the in-
terests of stochastic models in kinetic descriptions since the
implementation of different events can be introduced with little
effort. This point is emphasized in Ref. [122] and corresponds, in a
different context, to the interests and the advantages of the tra-
jectory point of view already mentioned (see Section 3).

In the two preceding developments, interacting particles were
considered as either always undergoing an elastic collision or al-
ways agglomerating into a cluster. Actually, a collision event can
lead to a rebound or an agglomeration depending on the condi-
tions at the time of the collision and the outcome can vary for each
pair of colliding particles. For example, for droplets, it is often
considered that collisions without coalescence occur when the
angle of impact is greater than a threshold value and that coales-
cence results otherwise. For colloidal particles, the difference is
related to the relative kinetic energy in the direction aligned with
the centers of mass of the two interacting particles compared to
the repulsive energy barrier that can exist due to DLVO-like forces
(see the description in Section 6.1.2): agglomeration occurs when
the particle relative kinetic energy is higher than the energy bar-
rier while rebound takes place otherwise. Such a criterion is
therefore based not only on the angle of impact but also on the
particle relative kinetic energies. These examples illustrate that, in
practice, combinations of the typical different events (elastic
collision, agglomeration, etc.) need to be jointly handled. This
mirrors the remarks made in Section 6.1.2 on the formulation of
boundary conditions.

As agglomeration can only occur upon collision, we can write
that, in a given physical situation, the collision and agglomeration
kernels are such that, without loss of generality, for two particles
labeled i and j, we have

Once a (stochastic) particle system has been proposed, it is al-
ways important to write the corresponding kinetic equation. In the
present situation, such a kinetic description is called a Boltz-
manneSmoluchowski equation and has been studied recently,
especially in the mathematically-oriented literature [128,129].
Following these works, the BoltzmanneSmoluchowski description
corresponding to the joint collision/agglomeration events can be
expressed as

of the kernels have been used (especially for the agglomeration
kernel where a dependence on the angle of contact has been
considered through a dependence on the unit vector e) to make a
distinction with the more usual form of these kernels (for instance,
with the classical agglomeration kernel K in Eq. (137)). Obviously,

In that respect, the ease with which such generalizations can be
made in the stochastic particle systems illustrates the interest of
these formulations. This exemplifies the merit listed as (e) in the
paragraph on ‘stochastic particle systems for collision events’ while
the merits indicated as (a), (b) and (c) have been demonstrated by
the developments described above. We now consider practical
formulations, in line with point (d) in the same list.

6.2.2. Modeling particleeparticle interactions

More than fifty years ago, the first ideas for the numerical
implementation of a stochastic particle system to simulate gas
dynamics were formulated with a view toward practical calcula-
tions [137]. The key idea was to propose a separate treatment of the
transport and collision steps over each small time step, leading to
time-splitting algorithms. For kinetic equations such as Eq. (127)
and Eq. (140) or Eq. (148), this means that the lhs, which corre-
sponds to the transport step, is treated first without collisions and
that the rhs, which corresponds to the collision step, is treated next
without transport. In other words: in the first step, particles are
moved through the domain but without interacting between them;
in the second step, particles interact but without changing their
positions. For that purpose, the domain is decomposed into small
volumes (typically into small cells that make up a spatial dis-
cretization of the flow domain) and only particles belonging to the
same cell interact through the selected random mechanism. For
clear reasons, this approach is called Direct Simulation Monte Carlo
(DSMC) and has become the reference method ever since (further
presentations and applications can be found in Refs. [138,139] and
recent improvements in Ref. [140]).

The ideas underlying the DSMC approach have inspired all nu-
merical algorithms as well as fundamental investigations [122,124],
revealing an ongoing two-way communication between engineer-
ing formulations and theoretical developments. In practice, the
separate treatment of the ‘collision step’ (which, from now on, re-
fers to any particleeparticle interaction) has allowed stochastic
particle systems, such as the ones considered in Section 6.2.1, to be
directly carried out to the numerical world. This also explains why

the presentations in Section 6.2.1 were mostly expressed in a
spatial homogeneous context since, in general algorithms, these
models are implemented locally in each cell where a homogeneous
assumption can be safely made.

Starting from the DSMC formulation, several algorithms have
been devised. In the context of droplet coalescence in sprays,
another reference is the O'Rourke's proposition [141] which used
the notion of ‘parcels’ where one computational particle represents
a group of (real) particles (whose number is associated to the parcel
as a numerical weight) to reduce the number of computational
particles. Yet, first applications of this algorithm were still limited
by a computational cost scaling as O(N2), where N represents the
number of particles or parcels located in the same cell at a given
time. Thus, for practical implementations, most of the algorithmic
effort has been devoted to reducing this scaling factor. In that
respect, interesting formulations have been built by using the
if we consider particle
notion of majorant kernels.
agglomeration and the example of the corresponding stochastic
particle system, the first two steps represented by Eqs. (142) and
(143) can be costly (the direct sums induce a O(N2)-cost scaling).
The majorant kernel approach consists in replacing the exact but
b
potentially difficult kernel K(i,j) by a simpler function, say
K ði; jÞ,
which is a majorant, and in applying the third step of the stochastic
particle system only with a probability given by Kði; jÞ= b
K ði; jÞ (note
b
K ði; jÞ being a majorant, this is indeed a probability). This
that
corresponds to the notion of ‘fictitious jumps’ (a form of the so-
called rejection sampling method) which, with proper choices of
the majorant kernel (leading to double N sums), has been shown to
be effective. More details can be found in Refs. [134,135,126].

Indeed,

An application for nano-particle agglomeration, detailed in
Ref. [136], is interesting in that it not only assesses the accuracy of
the method but also illustrates how generalizations can be intro-
duced. The purpose of that study is to investigate the synthesis and
growth of inorganic nanoparticles that are formed in flames and
plug flow reactors (see Ref. [136]). Three typical physical phe-
nomena are involved: first, monomeric particles are created from
the gas phase reactions, corresponding to the ‘production process’;
second, growth occurs by deposition on the surface of existing
particles which act as precursors, corresponding to the ‘surface
growth process’; third, the inorganic particles agglomerate due to
Brownian effects (in the free-molecular regime), corresponding to
the ‘coagulation process’. One application deals with the creation of
SiO2 particles in a low pressure H2/O2/Ar flame with traces of SiH4
acting as a precursor. The concentration of SiO2 particles is tracked
in a small gas volume moving with the gas velocity and the problem
is thus only dependent on time (a Lagrangian point of view). This
represents a typical hybrid formulation: a 1D flame code is first run
to yield the velocity field, the temperature profile and the rate of
production of the monomeric particulate species which are then
provided to the coagulation solver. The production and surface
growth processes require new models but, once they are defined,
these supplementary numerical steps corresponding to the ‘parti-
cle inception step’ and the ‘surface growth step’ are directly
introduced in the stochastic particle system already described in
Section 6.2.1 with Eqs. (142) and (143) and in the associated
transformation relations. Without going into the modeling details
which are related to this specific study, we can outline the way the
stochastic particle system is modified to account for these two new
possibilities as follows: to the production process corresponds a
probability Isource (related to the gas phase rate of production of the
monomers) and to the surface growth process corresponds a
2=Df
, where Isurf is the overall rate of
probability expressed as Isurf a0x
i
deposition onto the surface of all particles and a0 is the initial
surface of the precursor particles while the sizes xi, which are used

in the Smoluchowski description, correspond to dimensionless
volumes, i.e. x 1⁄4 w
=w0. The factor Df accounts for the fractal nature
of the aggregates that are formed and, in practice, a distinction
between two sub-classes of inorganic particles can be made to
separate the case of sintered aggregates (Df 1⁄4 3) from unsintered
ones (Df 1⁄4 2), though this is not presented here for the sake of
simplicity. Then, with the same hypothesis as in Section 6.2.1, the
extended stochastic particle system is described by:

By comparing the original stochastic system for particle
agglomeration in Section 6.2.1 to this version, it is seen that the
defining steps are simply extended to account for the two addi-
tional probabilities (see a detailed description of the complete al-
[136]). This indicates that complex physical

phenomena, once they are expressed by their characteristic rates,
are easily introduced in the approach. Numerical results obtained
with the extended algorithm are shown in Fig. 35 for the average
mass of SiO2 particles created as a function of the concentration of
the precursor SiH4, demonstrating that complex phenomena can be
investigated with this method.

However, a simulation method based on random waiting
times between successive jumps for the generalized Poisson
processes governing the stochastic particle systems is not
convenient if the collision step is to be strongly coupled with the

transport step, or with other phenomena, simulated at fixed time
intervals corresponding to the increments of a fixed time step.
For example, there was no real transport step in the above-
mentioned applications
[135,136]. Thus, alternative imple-
mentations have been developed in the more familiar setting of
time-forward marching methods with a given time step Dt (note
that, in that case, Dt is a parameter and not a random variable
anymore). With respect to these numerical formulations, two
propositions stand out with implementations scaling as O(N).
The first one is based on the no-time-counter (NTC) method and
was extended to deal with a variable number of particles per
parcel (thus for variable parcel numerical weights): it is still
based on the idea of introducing a simple majorant and making
corrections with the equivalent of fictitious jumps (which is close
to the null-collision technique). A clear and precise description is
given in Ref. [142]. The second one is based on the idea of
selecting randomly a small subset of pairs of parcels within all
possible ones and using re-scaled estimations for the number of
elementary collision events (between the particles attached to
each parcel) which is sampled in the Poisson distribution that
governs the number of possible particle collisions between each
pair of parcels. This algorithm is described in Ref. [133] and in
references provided in that article. These two practical formu-
lations have the interesting characteristic of naturally accounting
for possible multiple collisions within the same time step
[142,133]. They are both presented for droplet coalescence,
whose study has been a major incentive for the development of
new algorithms, and based on classical kinetic theory which
means that the collision kernel was estimated with the formula
in Eq.
they can be extended to simulate
agglomeration (or coalescence) within the same parcel. This
happens when different kernels are chosen, such as the Brow-
nian agglomeration kernel [130], to account for different physical
situations where particles are not necessarily following straight-
line trajectories. Therefore, it can be concluded that these algo-
rithms are suitable to simulate general ‘collision events’.

To illustrate that point, a validation result obtained with the
extended version of the algorithm in Ref. [133] (to account for self-
agglomeration within each parcel) is shown in Fig. 36 for the
simulation of particle agglomeration at a constant agglomeration

only produce clusters whose size divided by the initial one is an
integer and, therefore, the different classes corresponding to the
different sizes can be labeled with an integer index i). In that sit-
uation, classical formulas [143,144] yield that Nt decreases in time

stant value throughout the simulations, this is not a realistic situ-
ation from a physical point of view (apart from the initial stages of
agglomeration) and the test is essentially on the ability of the nu-
merical algorithm to reproduce the analytical laws. Simulations
were run for an initial set of monodisperse particles having a
diameter of dp 1⁄4 1 mm with a density of rp 1⁄4 2700 kg/m3in water at
normal pressure and temperature conditions. The value of the
agglomeration kernel was kept constant at the initial value corre-
sponding to the Brownian agglomeration kernel for monodisperse
(cid:2)3s
particles, that is Gaggl 1⁄4 8kBT/(3m)and a time step of Dt 1⁄4 2 (cid:3) 10
was used. Numerical results proved to be independent of the time
step, provided that a condition which can be written as GagglDt (cid:4) Cis
respected where C is threshold value related to the particle con-
centrations (see Ref. [133]). Numerical outcomes are shown in
Fig. 36 and it is seen that the algorithm reproduces accurately the
expected evolution for Ni(t)(1 (cid:4) i (cid:4) 4) and for Nt(t).

quadruplets (N4) whose evolution are given by Eq. (156), while symbols indicate nu-
merical results. For these results, the initial value was Nt(0) 1⁄4 4000.

Clearly, the developments of stochastic particle systems and of
tractable algorithms allow particleeparticle interactions, be they
elastic/inelastic collisions, agglomeration, fragmentation, etc., or
any combination of these elementary events, to be included in a
relatively easy manner in LSMs for polydisperse two-phase flows.
Going back to the parent algorithm, namely the DSMC method,
it is worth pointing out that this terminology may be misleading for
particles in turbulent flows. For the simulation of gases, the
description of particle (i.e. molecule) motion in terms of free-flight
and collision events, as well as the molecular chaos hypothesis, can
be regarded as a solid foundation or a well-established ‘model’.
Consequently, the collision kernel in Eq. (129) has also the status of
a well-justified formula. This explains the name of the method for
Molecular Dynamics applications. However, some care is in order
when we consider particles (solid particles, droplets, etc.) in tur-
bulent flows. From the considerations presented in Section 6.2.1
and in the present one (leaving aside the question of tractable al-
gorithms), it is seen that, for particles in flows, the stochastic par-
ticle systems and the corresponding kinetic descriptions remain
‘true models’. Indeed, they all rely on a pre-defined estimation of a
kernel to account for the frequency rate at which the chosen
‘collision event’ takes place. For discrete particles embedded in a
(potentially) turbulent flow, there is still uncertainty as to the
from simplified and
functional
asymptotic situations). A few remarks on the extension of kinetic-
based formulations to the standard approach for polydisperse
two-phase turbulent flows are now proposed.

form of such kernels (apart

6.2.3. Extension to the standard approach and open issues

The previous formulations follow the tracks of earlier Molecular
Dynamics developments and have been expressed in the frame-
work of kinetic-based approaches. However, for turbulent flows
where only some statistics of the fluid flow are available, the choice
of a particle state vector limited only to Z 1⁄4 (xp,Up,dp)raises ques-
tions and induces limits (this point is discussed in particular in
Ref. [36,1]). This is related to the central question of the choice of
the particle state vector used to build descriptive models for par-
ticles in turbulent flows (see Section 4.1). In Molecular Dynamics
approaches, the selection of the particle (i.e. molecule) state vector
made up by Ref. Z 1⁄4 (xp,Up)(leaving out here the particle diameter
for the sake of simplicity) is adequate. It can even be said that this is
hardly a choice but the exact definition corresponding to the free-
flight/collision mechanism which is known to describe molecular
motion. Yet, a brilliant achievement in gas kinetic theory can be,
when transposed directly to the context of particles embedded in
turbulent flows, an approximate model or, at least, an incomplete
description.

When the velocity of the fluid seen is introduced in the standard
particle state-vector Z 1⁄4 (xp,Up,Us,dp), the transformation rules for
collision events must be supplemented with conditions for Us.
Considering the case of elastic particle rebound, the extended
transformation relations that supersede Eq. (130) for the collision
event are

at the same point (the same condition for Us would apply for the
case of agglomeration). This is true in the approximation of
pointwise particles and remains valid provided that the distance
between the two particle centers of mass remains small with
respect to the Kolmogorov scale (or to a scale taken as representing
the distance below which fluid velocities are strongly correlated).
In the context of one-particle PDF and considering the standard
LSM described in Section 4.2, a simple model is to assume that
Unew
1⁄4 ðUs þ Uc;sÞ=2. These extended transformations rules can be
s
directly introduced in the last step of the simulation of the
appropriate stochastic particle system. For the example of elastic
collision, this means that the extended transformation relations in
Eq. (157) are added to the scheme in Eqs. (135) and (136). Drawing
on the conclusions reached in the previous section on the avail-
ability of stochastic particle systems and tractable algorithms for
particle collisions, it is then believed that this constitutes a com-
for standard LSMs in the one-particle
plete collision model
framework.

Should a two-particle (resulting in a two-point) PDF model be
available for the fluid description, no model for Unew
s would be
needed. Note that this issue is essentially to have a fluid two-
particle description, even if a two-(discrete)-particle PDF descrip-
tion would result out of it. Indeed, we would naturally have
Us(tc) 1⁄4 Uc,s(tc), where tc is the time of collision between two
discrete particles. This aspect is closely related to a third comment.
The third remark put forward in this section concerns the mo-
lecular chaos hypothesis. In Molecular Dynamics, the molecular
chaos assumption has the status of a founding principle. Yet, can we
simply transpose it to the case of discrete particles embedded in
turbulent flows without second thoughts? Indeed, particles trans-
ported by a fluid flow have velocities which are correlated to the
fluid velocity seen by each of them. Then, in a small fluid region
when particles follow converging trajectories, these fluid velocities
seen are correlated and, as a result, it can be expected that, upon
contact, discrete particles tend also to have correlated velocities. In
other words, discrete particle velocities are correlated by the spatial
coherence of the underlying carrier fluid flow. There are some sit-
uations where we can expect the molecular chaos assumption to
remain valid. For example, very small particles (say, with diameters
dp (cid:4) 0.1 mm or well within the colloidal range) are sensitive to fluid
Brownian effects and, since the Brownian ‘forces’ are independent at
each location (in a hydrodynamical description, small distances are
much larger than the fluid mean free path), we can expect particle
velocities to be nearly uncorrelated. At the other extreme, high-
inertia (or high Stokes-number) particles are not very sensitive to
fluid motion and the effects of previous collisions and of the ballistic
regime can be assumed to produce nearly uncorrelated velocities
upon particle contact. This can be also the case in dense regimes
when collisions are dominant and where the inherent randomness
associated to the interaction mechanisms keeps particles in the
realm of the molecular chaos property. However, for intermediate
Stokes numbers and for intermediate particle loads, collisions can
take place with particle velocities that are still correlated.

This represents an issue for kinetic descriptions since the colli-
sion term Qcoll(f) cannot be closed by relations such the one in Eq.
(133).
In Molecular Dynamics, stochastic particle systems are
evaluated with respect to the molecular chaos property (see the
comments and discussions in Ref. [122]) and to the Boltzmann ki-
netic equation which was first established. In the present context, it
is suggested to reverse that situation and to investigate deviations
from the molecular chaos property with simulations relying on
stochastic particle systems.

Finally, the developments presented throughout Section 6.2.1
provide an answer to question 3 listed in the introduction of Sec-
tion 6.

6.3. The issues of particle multilayer deposits and clogging

There is hardly any doubt that LSMs constitute appropriate
modeling frameworks to simulate single-particle deposition and
resuspension and it has been shown that particle agglomeration
can be accounted for. However, it can be wondered whether pre-
sent LSMs can address situations involving high particle volumetric
fraction (this is the basis of question 4 in the introduction to this
section). Such situations can be found, for example, in multilayer
particle deposition. In this case, N-particle approaches are, of
course, well-suited to investigate the intricate physical phenomena
at play. In this category, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) stands
out and is, for particles, the counterpart of DNS for the fluid phase
since exact calculations are performed between all particle degrees
of freedom (once particle interactions have been chosen). Yet, for
this very reason, DEM (or similar approaches) requires a DNS for
the fluid phase to have consistent methods for the fluid and particle
phases. For practical applications, there is thus considerable
impetus to extend the range of validity of one-particle PDF methods
to capture clogging effects.

In spite of the challenging nature of these situations, new de-
velopments have demonstrated the ability of LSMs to simulate the
formation and growth of multilayer deposits, even in the context of
one-particle PDF approaches. Such a model was proposed recently
[4] and was shown to reproduce the characteristic features of
multilayer particle deposition. This model is an extension of the two-
stage deposition model outlined in Section 6.1.1 for single-particle
deposition and is described elsewhere [4]. Yet, in the context of
the present discussion, it is useful to sketch the main aspects in order
to outline how not only particleeparticle interactions (already
considered in Section 6.2.1) but the volume two-way coupling effect
(see Section 4.4) can be included in a one-particle PDF model.

Basically, the modeling approach relies on an iterative proce-

dure [4]:

(a) at the beginning of one time step, the characteristic state of a
small surface-element is determined and, if particles have
deposited, the surface element is treated as a fouled surface.
At this stage, the statistical relevant quantities are calculated,
such as the particle surface coverage, the distribution of
particle/cluster width and height (since deposited particles
can merge into clusters that grow in the wallenormal di-
rection when the maximum surface coverage is reached),
etc.;

(b) during the time step, incoming particles (predicted by the
hydrodynamical model) interact with either a clean area of
this surface or with existing particles/clusters. This is done in
a probabilistic way by sampling the different possibilities
based on the statistical quantities determined in step (a);
(c) to determine if the incoming particles deposit, the same
energy-balance approach introduced in Section 6.1.2 is
applied. However,
the random energy barrier is now
dependent on previously-deposited particles.

Step (b) of this model is illustrated in Fig. 37 where it is seen that
the physical
interactions must always be calculated with the
diameter of the individual particles involved, whereas the clusters
are used for practical purposes in the model.

It is worth emphasizing that, though particleeparticle in-
teractions are accounted for, this model is still set within the class of
mean-field approaches and, as such, remains consistent with the
framework of one-particle PDF approaches. Furthermore,
it is
interesting to note that, in the case of single-particle deposition, the
energy-barrier E met by a particle is a random variable depending
on physical parameters and on the wall-surface roughness, that is

on information external to the particle simulation (apart from the
diameter of the particle considered). In the case of multilayer
deposition, this energy barrier is now a random variable which
depends also on all previously-deposited particles since these
particles modify the equivalent surface roughness ‘seen’ by each
incoming particle.

Similar precautions should also be taken when considering the
outcomes of numerical simulations. For example, a typical situation
expected in the case of a multilayer deposit is sketched in Fig. 38(a).
Such a figure could be extracted from a N-particle simulation but if
a one-particle PDF model is used, as for the model we are consid-
ering in this section, this would be meaningless since the relative
particle positions are not explicitly tracked. Only statistical quan-
tities derived from the set of particles are meaningful. A typical
outcome provided by the multilayer deposition model is shown in
Fig. 38(b). It is seen that, once the maximum particle surface
coverage is reached, the growth of the multilayer deposit is rep-
resented by an ensemble of clusters which are described as rising
cylinders. Actually, each of these cylinders represents a sample and
the true information provided by the model is the distribution of
the size of these cylinders and thus of the roughness of the
developing deposit. Note that other information, such as the
porosity or the volume fraction occupied by the particles, is also an
outcome of this approach.

6.3.1. Two-way coupling and clogging effects

In these first developments, the fluid flow was left unchanged,
which means that a one-way coupling was assumed. This is, of

course, not realistic for these two-phase flows but this simplified
situation was considered first to follow a step-by-step approach.
Based on the satisfactory results obtained for the predictions of
multilayer deposits, the next step is to account for two-way
coupling.

In Section 4.4, it was mentioned that, for particle-laden flows,
two-way coupling involves mostly the momentum and kinetic
energy exchange terms while the particle volume fraction can still
be low. This means that the volume two-way coupling effect is
often neglected and that only the energy two-way coupling effect is
usually accounted for in most Lagrangian simulations. The situation
is different here, as the formation of multilayer deposits corre-
sponds to regions where the particle volume fraction is very high
and close to the maximum value limited by the packing factor (say
amax
x0:7). In other words, the particle volume fraction is typically
p
low in the bulk of the flow but reaches its maximum value inside
wall deposits that can grow to occupy a region large enough to
modify significantly the fluid flow. In that sense, the sharp increase
of ap is a leading factor for the impact of deposits on the sur-
rounding fluid flow.

In the framework of classical Moment/PDF hybrid approaches
(Euler/Lagrange), recent developments have been proposed by
coupling the particle deposition model for multilayer deposits to a
porous media formulation [145]. The results presented in Figs. 39
and 40 illustrate the growth of a compact deposit on a wall sur-
face and its effect on the fluid flow. For this simulation, large par-
ticles (with a diameter of around 80 mm) were released in a pipe
flow, instead of colloidal particles to avoid a very long transit time

before a deposit is formed (see Fig. 39). Particles are injected with a
certain angle toward the wall so as to favor deposition and a first
deposit is seen in Fig. 39 soon after particle injection. Conditions are
chosen so that repulsive particleeparticle interactions remain weak
and successive particles tend to deposit on already deposited ones
leading to the growth of a local deposit. Then, as this process is
continuous, the deposit grows up to the point where a significant
volume of the fluid flow is occupied (see Fig. 40). The back effect of
the wall deposit on the fluid flow is seen in Fig. 40 and a typical
wake flow develops downstream of the deposit.

For industrial applications, the above results are of importance
as they show that present Lagrangian models can not only predict
particle deposition rates and the formation/growth of particle de-
posits on wall surfaces but can also account for two-way coupling
(especially, changes of the fluid pressure drops) and, eventually, the
possible clogging of fluid cross-sections. Such a step is essential for
multilayer resuspension which, at the moment, is still an open issue
(see discussions in Ref. [13]). Therefore, these results provide a
positive answer to the question 4 listed in the introduction of
Section 6.

6.4. Toward structure-based models

To a non-expert browsing the available literature, it may seem
that LSMs are basically one-point models, meant for dilute two-
phase flows and restricted by the RANS context. However, the
specific examples presented in Section 6 have shown that LSMs
offer a flexible framework that allows models to be extended
beyond these limits. In that sense, the fact that LSMs can address
the whole range of phenomena involved in particle fouling, from

single-particle deposition to multilayer formation and clogging
effects, is a relevant aspect to bring forth [4].

From the examples discussed above, two conclusions can be
proposed. As often when first steps are attempted into poorly
charted territories, one is a caveat while the other one is an
encouragement to go forward.

The word of caution concerns the clarification on the nature of
the information that can be extracted from a modeling approach
and on the information that remains external to the description. In
the context of LSMs, this is related to the choice of the underlying
PDF that is handled. Particle agglomeration provides an example: if
a one-particle PDF is chosen, then it is not possible to calculate the
agglomeration kernel from the particle simulation, as there is no
space information available. In other words, it makes no sense to try
to extract from a one-point approach what is related to multi-point
correlations. As seen in Section 6.2.2, agglomeration can be
accounted for but the form of the agglomeration kernel is an input.
Yet, if a N-PDF approach is chosen, then the particle relative posi-
tion and motion are contained within the description and, in that
case, agglomeration kernels can be obtained as outputs (see recent
developments in Refs. [146,147]).

The word of motivation concerns the development of structure-
based models. The two-stage model introduced in Section 6.1.1 is
one example within a larger class of models. Indeed, the ideas
embodied by this model point to opportunities for LSMs to capture
more physics than current formulations, while still relying on the
standard state-vector Z 1⁄4 (xp,Up,Us). The key principle is to express
the velocity of the fluid seen through the random succession of a set
of models, each of which represents the specific signature of one
structure among a given set of fluid coherent structures. As we are

50

still in the framework of one-point approaches, this new formula-
tion appears as an alternative to present methods for the prediction
of fluid statistics. However, there is an interest for particle-laden
flows: since particles respond differently to each structure,
depending on their inertia and on the characteristics of each fluid
structure, non-trivial behavior could be captured and, in particular,
particle preferential concentrations (which is, indeed, a tendency of
particles to be correlated with specific fluid structures). Obviously,
such structure-based models are still in their infancy and much
work remains to be done.

In such a structure-based model, the set of coherent structures,
as well as their defining statistical properties (life time, intensities,
etc.) have to be characterized right from the outset, for instance by
previous DNS. This means that, first, such DNS along with the
relevant statistical information should be available and, second,
that the basic elements of the scenario are written in advance. It is
believed that the spirit of the ideas underlying such structure-
based models corresponds naturally to LES approaches and that
they would take their full value in this context. In effect, LES is
meant to calculate explicitly large-scale structures and this opens
the way for a possible dynamical approach where a set of struc-
tures could be dynamically reconstructed (or, at least, their sta-
tistical properties). This represents a long-term objective and it is
hoped that present thoughts will encourage new ideas along that
path. However, in a step-by-step construction of structure-based
models for particle-laden flows in the LES context, a few build-
ing blocks must be set up. To start with, the theoretical framework
for LSMs as models for two-phase flows where the fluid is calcu-
lated with a LES must be established. This is the purpose of the
next section.

7. Extensions to large-Eddy simulations

In the preceding sections, LSMs have been addressed in the
context of Reynolds-averaged formulations for the fluid phase. Yet,
the last two decades or so have seen a marked increase in the
application of the LES method to turbulent flows. Though the
resulting modeled equations between the LES and Reynolds-stress
(even k (cid:2) ε) models look very similar, there is a fundamental dif-
ference since the averaged quantities entering Reynolds ap-
proaches are defined as probabilistic expectations while the
quantities entering the LES formulation are obtained through a
spatial filtering operation. This already suggests that a new
formalism must be introduced to extend the PDF framework to the
LES one. Furthermore, the basic ideas of the LES approach to single-
phase turbulent flows, where the large energy-containing scales
are directly computed while the effects of the smaller scales (large
and small scales are defined with respect to a chosen grid size) are
modeled through SGS models, do not solve the closure problem for
reactive flows as chemical source terms are governed by molecular
processes which take place at a smaller scale than the cut-off
length. Thus, models must still be used for reactive flows simu-
lated with a LES approach and this puts a stronger emphasis on the
need to have a relevant formalism to guide modeling steps as well
as to assess various proposals.

For that purpose, a new formalism for turbulent single-phase
flows has been developed, mostly by Pope and various co-
workers, in a step-by-step manner [148e153]. This formalism is
based on the central notion of the filtered density function (FDF) for
constant-density flows [148,150,151] and on the filtered mass
density function (FMDF) for variable-density flows [149,152,153].
Models can then be evaluated with respect to an existing theoret-
ical framework and it can be said that present formulations have
reached a promising level for single-phase turbulent reactive flows
[3].

For particle-laden flows, the situation is different. Since LES is
meant to capture the large scales that are dominant in particle
transport, it was first believed that particle simulations could be
performed by retaining only the filtered fluid velocity seen in the
particle equation of motion. In other words, this was equivalent to
treating a LES as a DNS for particles and to neglecting altogether the
influence of fluid velocity subgrid fluctuations on particle motion.
However, it was revealed that this was a too drastic assumption
[154,52] and that the effects of subgrid fluid velocities had to be
accounted for to capture correctly particle kinetic properties [54],
not to mention phenomena related to small scales such as particle
preferential concentrations [54]. Consequently, a number of models
for the unresolved part of the fluid velocity seen by discrete par-
ticles have appeared in recent years. Yet, these models have been
put forward simply as direct extensions of the ones developed for
Reynolds-averaged approaches, often without precise justifications
and without being based on well-established first principles. These
models vary in their formulation (some proposals are written in
terms of the fluctuating or unresolved fluid velocities [155,54,156]
while others model the instantaneous velocities [157,158]) but,
more noticeably, they differ in some key aspects: some propositions
retain only the simplest form of a Langevin model [156], others
consider additional terms but with an expression that amounts to
disregarding possible subgrid CTE [155] whereas others [157,158]
used a modeled equation similar to the complete Langevin model
presented in Section 4, though with a simplified version of the drift
term. Most strikingly, all these propositions are based only on
Langevin models but, even in this limited class of models, there are
widely different assumptions built in the formulations that need to
be addressed and clarified. For instance, some propositions assume
that the unresolved part of the fluid velocity seen is at equilibrium
[156], some assume a fluid-like behavior with a non-zero dissipa-
tion rate of the subgrid kinetic energy [155], while others account
for particle inertia and with dissipation effects [157,158]. This re-
sults, in particular, in very different expressions of the diffusion
coefficients of the stochastic diffusion models.

Clearly, there is some confusion in the formulation of stochastic
models to represent fluid subgrid effects and in the basic properties
that such models should respect. This points to the lack of a proper
theoretical framework in which stochastic models can be safely
developed for particle-laden flows simulated with a LES approach.
At this stage, it is worth indicating that the FDF and FMDF ideas of
single-phase flows, which have been developed for fields, cannot
be directly extended to disperse two-phase flows due to the very
Lagrangian nature of the problem.

The aim of this section is to clarify how the LES approach can be
formulated for disperse two-phase flows and, for that purpose, a
new formalism is introduced. In the following, the main notions of
the FDF and FMDF approach to single-phase turbulent flows are
first recalled in Section 7.1. Specific issues and the difficulties
induced by the presence of a set of particles are addressed in Sec-
tion 7.2 while the new formalism is established in Section 7.3.

7.1. The filtered density function approach for single-phase flows

As disperse two-phase flows have similarities with variable-
density single-phase flows (since variations of the particle volu-
metric fraction ap(t,x) means that the local particle mass fraction
aprp is akin to a variable density even when rp is constant), it is
useful to introduce directly the more complete formalism of the
FMDF. However, for the sake of simplicity, we limit ourselves to
presenting only the dynamical aspects related to the fluid velocity
field. In that sense, though the velocity-FDF formalism for constant-
density flows was mainly put forward in Ref. [150], we will mostly

refer to the developments related to the velocity-FMDF as detailed
in Ref. [152].

In single-phase flows, the starting point is naturally provided by
the NaviereStokes equations for the fluid velocity field Uf(t,x) and
the continuity and momentum equations can be written under the
following form (these equations complement the ones in Eq. (1),
since the context of variable-density flows is considered)

The key interest of the FMDF is that, under the condition of a
positive filter kernel, F E
f ;ls has all the properties of a MDF. Following
the presentations made in the original articles where the FMDF was
introduced [149,152,153], this is illustrated by considering the
conditional filtered value of a variable Q(t,x):

7.1.1. FMDF and stochastic particle systems

In the original articles devoted to the development of the FDF
and FMDF approaches, this exact FMDF function is usually first
modeled and then solved by a Lagrangian Monte Carlo scheme
[148e150] or, alternatively, a modeled diffusion process can be
directly introduced whereby the Lagrangian particles (which
represent the trajectories of the stochastic process) serve both as a
model and as the numerical solution [151e153]. To illustrate this
connection, we consider a modeled form for the exact FMDF
equation, Eq. (172), as proposed in Ref. [152] where the molecular
viscous terms are neglected for the sake of simplicity. For the
velocity-FMDF, which is our limited interest in the present section,
each stochastic particle is defined by its position and velocity. Then,
the stochastic differential equations which express the evolution in
time of the variables attached to these particles are given by

1 the first one is the principle of ‘equivalent systems’ [7,25] which
states that two systems that yield the same statistics (in our
present example, the same statistics on the fluid velocity field)
are equivalent. Actually, this is the physical formulation of the
mathematical notion of the weak approximation of the law of a
stochastic process, as already recalled in Section 4.2;

2 the second one makes use of the full PDF machinery recalled in
Section 3. If we take as an example the stochastic particle system
in Eq. (173), then the corresponding PDF equation is a Fok-
kerePlanck equation in sample space

where Ai is the drift vector in Eq. (173b) and B the diffusion
coefficient (note that, since the diffusion matrix in Eq. (173b) is
isotropic, the diffusion term in the FokkerePlanck equation has the
simplified form of a Laplacian with B2 1⁄4 C0ε). In this equation, it is
important to be aware that pL

The notation used in sample space for the particle location, which is
indeed a variable and is written as yf, is helpful to remember that
we are basically handling a transitional Lagrangian PDF. Then, by
using the fundamental relations given in Eq. (34) and in Eq. (35),
the same FokkerePlanck equation is satisfied by the Eulerian MDF

When the rhs of Eq. (176) is taken as a model for the rhs of the exact

In the above closures, C0 and Cε are model constants, Dls the LES
filter size and k and ε represent the SGS kinetic energy and dissi-
pation respectively. For variable-density flows, the above equations
are not closed as density and pressure must be obtained by simu-
lating additional variables through a set of compositional scalars,
such as chemical species mass fractions and enthalpy, but they are
sufficient for the present discussion. In the case of constant-density
flows, the model in Eq. (173) reverts to the so-called VFDF2 model
considered in Ref. [150]. It is clear that the typical closures exem-
plified by Eq. (173) are direct extensions of current proposals that
have been made in the PDF context.

In what sense can we say that simulating such a particle system
represents a LES of a turbulent flow? To answer that question, it is

Thus, the Eulerian MDF extracted from the particle system is
equated to the FMDF introduced from the LES formalism, as man-
ifested by the notation retained in this presentation which in-
troduces a specific suffix E to indicate the Eulerian nature of present
FMDFs. This connection was clarified in earlier papers [148e150]
but some minor notational confusion can be found in later papers
(for instance, Eq. (23) in Ref. [152] identifies F E

; Vf
the unconditional Lagrangian PDF of the particle system. Though it
does not change the basic relations and the moments extracted
from the two PDF equations in sample-space, such an equivalence
is not strictly correct).

In practice, the direct connection between statistics derived
from the particle system and LES filtered variables is given by the
general PDF formalism. Indeed, the conditional Lagrangian PDF is
equal to the Eulerian Favre-PDF (see Refs. [1], Section 6.4). By taking
statistics from the local number of particles Nx located within a
small volume dV xcentered around a given point x (with (n) rep-
resenting the particle index where, for a matter of convenience, we
have labeled the subset of particles present in the small volume
dV xas n 1⁄4 1,...,Nx), we have that

7.2. Remarks on the present FDF/FMDF formalism for single-phase
flows

Before turning our attention to a new FMDF approach for the
description of the particle phase in turbulent flows, three remarks
can be made on the (by now) classical FDF and FMDF formalism for
the LES method applied to single-phase turbulent flows.

7.2.1. PDF-RANS and FDF-LES models

Once the connection between the filtered variables, such as
〈Uf,i〉LS, and the averaged values from the stochastic particle sys-
tem is clarified, the stochastic differential equations which govern
the evolution of the variables attached to the particles can be reset
in a familiar probabilistic setting. For this purpose, it is sufficient
to consider only constant-density flows (where 〈rf〉ls is a constant
rf and where the filtering operators noted 〈$〉ls and 〈$〉LS are
identical). Then, using Eq. (178), the particle system given in Eq.
(173) can be re-expressed, writing the local averaged velocity
simply as 〈Uf,i〉

where the mean pressure term could be obtained from the conti-
nuity equation. This stochastic particle system bears a striking
similarity with the GLM proposed in the RANS context [7,25,9] (see
Eq. (56) in Section 4.2). Thus, it could be wondered how the LES
context appears in these equations. Actually, the real LES context
appears through the closure retained for the dissipation ε in Eq.
(174) which is explicitly based on the LES filter size Dls. In that sense,
ε can be thought of as a model for the SGS dissipation, as already
indicated above. This difference between the SLM-RANS and SLM-
LES formulations is similar to the difference between the PDE
satisfied by the filtered velocity field in the LES approach based on
the Smagorinsky model on the one hand and the PDE equation
satisfied by the mean velocity field in the k (cid:2) εmodel on the other
hand: both have the same form but the closure retained for the
turbulent viscosity is inherently different [9].

7.2.2. The non-randomness of present LES formulations

Drawing on the similarities between the RANS-PDF and LES-FDF
frameworks, it is seen that both evolve from the fine-grained PDF
which, if we consider velocity and scalar variables, is expressed by

Then, the (Eulerian) one-point PDF is obtained by applying the

probabilistic averaging (or expectation) operator 〈$〉

point MDF obtained by the same application of the probabilistic
averaging operator

f ;ls and F E

The developments of the FDF and FMDF approaches are built on
that analogy. However, it must be stressed that, at present, this
remains an analogy and not a mathematically well-defined corre-
spondence. Indeed, 〈$〉 is a true mathematical expectation operator
while 〈$〉ls cannot be regarded as such (it is well-known that even
the idempotence property 〈〈A〉ls〉ls 1⁄4 〈A〉lsis not satisfied). Therefore,
while pE
f are proper probabilistic measures, pE
f ;ls are
not. For instance, from the very definition of the FDF and FMDF in
Eq. (164), it is clear that F E
f ;ls is still a random function and, as such,
cannot be truly regarded as a proper density function or distribu-
tion. In the present state of development of the FDF formalism,
these differences are not accounted for or, in other words, it is
assumed that the remaining randomness left by the spatial filtering
operator can be ignored. This is illustrated by the identity in Eq.
(177) between the FMDF and the Eulerian MDF from the particle
stochastic system which is a non-random function and a true
density. This point was put forward by Fox [8] and later addressed
by Pope [159] and Fox [160] but it is believed that an improved
mathematical definition remains to be built.

7.2.3. The need of a new approach for disperse two-phase flows

The FDF formalism developed for turbulent reactive single-
phase flows is clearly based on the introduction of an Eulerian
FMDF F E
f ;ls. This is consistent with the fact that the basic exact
equations involve fields and this is reflected in the definitions given
in Eqs. (164) and (165) which are based on the continuous fields
associated to the fluid. However, in polydispersed two-phase flows,
the situation is different since the basic exact equations for the
particle phase are Lagrangian by nature. Thus, it is not straight-
forward to carry present FDF ideas to the two-phase flow case as
there are no particle-fields to input in a definition akin to one in Eq.
(164). This explains that, in order to develop a well-based LES

treatment of the particle phase, the FDF approach must be revisited
from a different standpoint. First ideas were put forward in
Ref. [161] and a new proposition along these lines is now
developed.

7.3. A new filtered density function approach for two-phase flows

It was recalled in Section 3.1 that the Lagrangian MDF plays a
central role in the PDF approach to polydisperse two-phase flows.
For the development of a LES description of a polydisperse particle
phase, we propose to retain also the Lagrangian standpoint as the
main guideline. More precisely, we first consider particles
described by a state vector Z which includes the particle position
and velocity plus a set of associated scalars for reactive processes
FpðtÞ, and we introduce the discrete Lagrangian MDF (discrete-
LMDF)

〈yp

As such, we cannot express an integral property similar to the
one in Eq. (171), as we have not yet defined particle filtered fields.
However, following what is done in the PDF framework (see Section
3.1), this is achieved by defining an Eulerian FMDF (or EFMDF),
written as F E

used, for instance, in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
methods.

The difference between the single-phase flow and the dispersed
two-phase flow cases is noteworthy. In the single-phase situation,
we are handling fields right from the outset and filtered (field)
values can thus be defined directly or in terms of the FDF formalism.
In that sense, Eq. (171) is indeed a property. In the dispersed two-
phase flow situation, there are no fields for the particle phase
and, therefore, a direct formulation of filtered quantities is mean-
ingless. The road toward filtered fields is built by, first, introducing
the Lagrangian FMDF and, then, by defining the Eulerian FMDF and
filtered quantities. In that sense, Eq. (195) is now the definition for
the field of a filtered quantity derived from a Lagrangian variable
rather than a property. For example, from the definitions in Eqs.
(195)e(197), the particle filtered velocity field is given by

The definition is very similar to the ones appearing in the PDF
framework. In the PDF context, such expressions are used for the
numerical estimations of local averages (with G appearing as a
kernel function and, e.g. in the particle-in-cell method, is taken as
GðxÞ 1⁄4 ð1=dV xÞ11⁄2x2dV x(cid:7)) whereas it is here the very definition of
the filtered particle velocity field. This point is taken up in Section
7.3.4.

Then, any transport equations for filtered fields can be extracted
by integration over the corresponding sample spaces, e.g. by
application of Eq. (194) and of Eq. (195). This is illustrated in Section
7.3.3. The exact transport equation for the LFMDF and EFMDF can be
also decomposed into filtered and ‘fluctuations’ (or unresolved

7.3.2. Modeled particle-EFMDF and particle stochastic systems

While other forces can be added in more general situations,
limiting ourselves to drag forces is sufficient to illustrate the
modeling approach. This means that AUp is given by

AUp 1⁄4 UsðtÞ (cid:2) UpðtÞ
;

tp

(206)

where Us(t) is the fluid velocity seen and tp the particle relaxation
time scale whose expression was discussed in Section 2.

The first idea applied in LES simulations with solid particles was
to disregard subgrid effects and to identify the instantaneous fluid
velocity seen Us(t) with the available filtered value at the particle
location, Us(t) 1⁄4 〈Uf〉LS(t,xp(t)). A second assumption was to replace
tp, which depends on the instantaneous particle and fluid seen
velocities, by an expression based only on the filtered relative ve-
locity 〈Ur〉LS 1⁄4 〈Up〉LS(cid:2)〈Us〉LS which we write as ð etpÞ
Þ
LS
(note that ð etpÞ
LS). In this case, the description in terms of
particle location xp(t) and velocity Up(t) is indeed appropriate since
Us(t) is now given and we can keep the expression of the LFMDF
(and EFMDF) introduced in the previous section (leaving out sca-
; VpÞ. The evolution equation has the
lars), written now as F L

However, following the choice of the standard particle state
vector in PDF methods (Section 4), it appears interesting to retain
the same description for polydisperse particles transported in a
turbulent fluid flow described with a LES. This means that we are
handling the extended discrete-LFMDF where the velocity of the
fluid seen appears as an additional variable attached to each par-

To sum up: the solution of this FokkerePlanck equation is a
model for the exact LFMDF in Eq. (210) and is approximated by
considering the modeled particle system in Eq. (211) which, in turn,
is a model for the exact particle system Eq. (209).

7.3.3. Transport equations for particle moments

Transport equations for particle filtered fields are derived by
extracting the corresponding moments from the modeled EFMDF
and using the definition in Eq. (195). For example, for the general
model form given in Eq. (211) and the corresponding EFMDF
equation in Eq. (212), the zeroth and first moment equations are

velocity (〈ksp,ij〉LS 1⁄4 〈Us,iUp,j〉LS (cid:2) 〈Us,i〉LS〈Up,j〉LS). Note that, unless we
restrict ourselves to the simplistic case of a constant particle
relaxation timescale tp which implies that polydispersity is
neglected, the last term on the rhs of Eq. (214) is unclosed whereas
it is not in the direct simulation of the trajectories of the process in
Eq. (211). This means that the classical arguments proposed in the
context of Reynolds-averaging on the interest of the PDF (here the
FMDF) approach over the moment approach remain valid [1].
Furthermore, higher-order moment equations, for instance for the
SGS particle kinetic stress, the SGS fluid-particle correlation, etc.,
can be derived in a straightforward manner and have a form similar
to the ones discussed in detail in previous works on the PDF
approach [1].

7.3.4. Filtered particle variables and stochastic particle systems

For polydisperse two-phase flows, the natural starting point is
formulated in terms of particles and, thus, the correspondence
between the modeled LFMDF (and EFMDF) and the particle sto-
chastic system, as discussed in Section 7.3.2, is less surprising than
in the single-phase flow case. However, the situation is basically the
same and the discussions developed in Section 7.1.1, in particular for
Eq. (178), remain valid. There are, yet, some differences that are
worth noting between the fluid and the particle cases.

In the single-phase flow case, the filtering operator is first
introduced by a localized but continuous spatial filtering operator.
If we refer to the constant-density case for the sake of simplicity,
this is illustrated by the basic definition of the filtered fluid velocity
given in Eq. (161). Then, the equivalence formulated in Eq. (177) and
the developments leading to Eq. (178) show that the set of nu-
merical (fluid) particles are such that

It must be noted that the small volumes dV x are only used to
take ensemble averages to estimate mean values from the sto-
chastic particles around the LES grid nodes x. These small volumes
are not to be confused with the LES filter volume D3
ls (in practice,
dV x can be a subdivision of the LES filter volume D3
ls), which ex-
plains that the size of the box used for ensemble averages dV 1=3
can go to zero while the LES filter size Dls remains finite. This point
is discussed in Refs. [148e150].

x

The Monte Carlo estimation of the averaged velocity appearing
on the lhs of Eq. (216) is the classical ensemble averaging estimator
where all particles (located in the small volume considered V x)
have the same weight. For practical reasons and numerical effi-
ciency, it is sometimes useful to introduce different statistical
weights for the particles and, for example, to evaluate the averaged
velocity from the particle stochastic system through the more
general Monte Carlo estimator

Eq. (222), and Np

However, we saw in Eq. (199) that the present formalism has led
to the definition of 〈Up;i
〉
LS as a mass-weighted average where the
value of the filter at the neighboring particle locations appear as the
equivalent of a statistical weight. Therefore, though classical Monte
Carlo estimations such as the one in Eq (218) converge towards the
same value, it may appear interesting to chose specifically to build
numerical evaluations using G(x (cid:2) xp(t)) as the statistical weight for
the particle (n), which leads to

With such a choice, the Monte Carlo estimation from the particle
stochastic system, in Eq. (221) and the definition of the filtered
particle value in Eq. (199) have the same form. Note, however, that
this remains a correspondence since the particle filtered values are
obtained by a sum over the real neighboring particles being present
in the particle-laden flow which is considered whereas the nu-
merical Monte Carlo estimation is based on the stochastic (or
notional) particles which mimic the real-particle behavior but
remain different from them. On the other hand, this close corre-
spondence may allow the stochastic particle system and the Monte
Carlo estimation proposed above to be efficient tools to obtain
particle filtered fields.

7.3.5. SGS model and first consistency requirements

As a practical example of the framework developed above and of
a particle stochastic system, it is proposed to consider the extension
to the LES context of the state-of-the-art stochastic model used for
the PDF description of polydisperse two-phase flows (see Section
4.2). Using the general form of the original PDF model, this model is
written as

between the EFMDFs and we have that

where the coefficient C0, the SGS kinetic energy k and the SGS
dissipation ε are the same as in Eq. (174) for the fluid-particle sto-
chastic model in Eq. (173). The difference between the matrix Gij in

the timescale of fluid particle unresolved velocities and the time-
scale of unresolved velocities of the fluid seen by discrete particles,
respectively in the direction transverse to the filtered relative ve-
locity or parallel to it. Carrying Csanady closures to the LES context,
these coefficients can be given by

Eq. (163) (〈tf,ij〉LS 1⁄4 〈Uf,iUf,j〉LS (cid:2) 〈Uf,i〉LS〈Uf,j〉LS).

This model has interesting properties. For instance, when par-
ticle inertia vanishes, it is straightforward to show that the model in
Eq. (222) reverts to the one expressed by Eq. (173) in Section 7.1.1.
Since the latter model was shown to provide a satisfactory
description of single-phase turbulent flows (see the analysis in
Ref. [150] where, in particular, the consistency between the mo-
ments extracted from the stochastic particle system was shown to
be adequate models of the exact second-order moments), the same
properties are inherited by the present two-phase flow LES model
in the tracer-particle limit.

The tracer-particle limit is one of the criteria set forth in a recent
analysis of the formulation of stochastic models for single- and
two-phase flows [19] and already referred to in Sections 4.2e4.3.
This analysis was developed in the context of RANS approaches. Yet,
from the above relations and the newly-established theoretical
framework for two-phase LES, it is seen that the conclusions
reached in the PDF context on model consistency requirements can
be carried out to the LES context. This means that the results ob-
tained in Ref. [19] apply in the present context.

As indicated at the beginning of Section 7, there is at the
moment some uncertainty as to the form that models for the

velocity of the fluid seen should exhibit when they are formulated
‘fluctuating’ velocity components. Following the
in terms of
reasoning set forth in Ref. [19], it is useful to provide some further
details on this issue. First, the fluctuating (or unresolved) part of the
velocity of the fluid seen is defined as u0
LS, as for
s;i
models in the context of RANS approaches [43,1,19]. Then, the
correspondence between a model for Us,i and u0
s;ican be derived. For
the sake of simplicity, we consider here only incompressible high
Reynolds-number fluid flows, thus with 〈rf〉ls 1⁄4 rf which also im-
plies that the operators noted 〈$〉ls and 〈$〉LS in Section 7.1 are
identical. From the definition of the unresolved velocity of the fluid
seen, we have

(cid:2) 〈Uf ;i

Then, from the high Reynolds-number form of the filtered

can be neglected, the equation for the fluctuating fluid velocity seen
becomes

This equation is similar to the one classically written in the
RANS context [19] and, in correspondence, the signification and
importance of the various terms appearing on the rhs of Eq. (230)
are the same in the LES context. In short, the conclusions reached
in Ref. [19] apply also here.

8. Conclusions and perspectives

account of

The main objective of this paper was to provide a compre-
hensive
Lagrangian Stochastic
state-of-the-art
Methods for polydisperse two-phase flows. Indeed, LSMs have an
easy-to-implement nature which means that they can blossom in
many directions. In that respect, the attempt made here was to
illustrate the interest of LSMs for widely different applications,
while still casting these various aspects
in one general
framework.

This overall aim was conjugated into several purposes which

were:

(a) to recall the PDF framework that allows stochastic models to
be rigorously linked to their corresponding continuum, or
mean-field, descriptions (see Section 3);

(b) to outline the physics of present Langevin models, which
make up the mainstream class of stochastic models for
polydisperse two-phase flows, and clarify their interests as
well as their limitations (see Section 4);

J.-P. Minier / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 50 (2015) 1e62

59

(c) to exemplify the attractiveness of LSMs for complex-physic
problems where involved descriptions can be handled
without approximation (see Section 5);

(d) to indicate that LSMs are not limited to dilute and collision-
less regimes but can be extended for this issue (see Section
6);

(f) to reveal that, even in a RANS context, LSMs offer the pos-
sibility to develop interesting structure-based models (see
Section 6);

(g) to develop a detailed new formalism for polydisperse two-
phase flows in the LES context which is a current domain
of investigation (Section 7).

These conclusions do not mark the end of modeling efforts but
simply a pause along the way. Thus, what are the issues that need
further work? In the opinion of the present author, it is believed
that three directions are worth pursuing and/or exploring:

1. the first one follows the development of classical Langevin
models by improving the reference model described in Section
4.2 which relies on the SLM in the fluid limit. For example, ex-
tensions of the GLM model to the two-phase flow case (ac-
counting for particle inertia and CTE) would be of practical
interest;

2. the second one is about developing structure-based models, in
the spirit of the first attempts proposed in Section 6.1 or similar
ideas. These new models can benefit from what has been gained
with classical formulations (‘(cid:2)a la Langevin’) while offering the
possibility to address particle preferential concentration effects;
3. the third one consists in devising new models in order to benefit
from the information provided by LES approaches for the cal-
culations of the fluid phase rather than importing current ideas
from the RANS context.

Finally, it is hoped that this review article will help researchers
and engineers alike to assess LSMs for what they are and, then, be in
a position to make their own choices and contributions to the
subject of modeling and simulating polydisperse two-phase flows.
