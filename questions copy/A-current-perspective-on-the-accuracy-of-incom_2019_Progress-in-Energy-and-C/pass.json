    "standard_answer": "Cloud motion introduces turbulent flow characteristics that follow the Navier-Stokes equations ∂u/∂t + (u·∇)u = -∇p/ρ + ν∇²u + F. For intra-hour forecasts (≤1h), cloud advection can be approximated using frozen turbulence hypothesis where Taylor's hypothesis applies (u·∇)u ≈ U∂u/∂x with characteristic velocity scale U~10m/s. This allows relatively accurate tracking via optical flow methods. However, for day-ahead forecasts (>12h), the turbulent kinetic energy cascade becomes significant as eddies break down across multiple scales (integral scale ~1km to Kolmogorov scale ~1mm). The Richardson number Ri = gΔθL/θU² shows increasing instability with longer time scales, making NWP models sensitive to initial conditions (butterfly effect). The paper's observed error growth from ~23% RMSE (IH) to ~42% RMSE (DA) reflects this fundamental fluid dynamics limitation.",

    "standard_answer": "From the exponential error growth model ε = ε₀exp(t/τ), we derive τ = Δt/ln(ε₂/ε₁). For tropical climate (A): mean nRMSE increases from 13.29% (1st quartile IH) to 32.00% (1st quartile DA) over Δt=23h. Thus τ_A = 23/ln(32/13.29) = 23/0.885 ≈ 26 hours. For snow climate (D): nRMSE increases from 30.56% (3rd quartile IH) to 51.00% (3rd quartile DA), giving τ_D = 23/ln(51/30.56) = 23/0.511 ≈ 45 hours. The 73% longer τ_D indicates more persistent cloud patterns in snow climates, consistent with the paper's finding that 'ML and hybrid models perform well in tropical and snow climates'. This timescale difference arises from thermal stability - tropical convection creates shorter-lived cumulus while snow climates favor stratiform clouds with higher Richardson numbers.",

The clearness index k_t = G/G_ext thus decomposes as: k_t = exp[-τ_{Rayleigh}] × exp[-τ_{aerosol}] × exp[-τ_{cloud}}]. The first two terms are deterministic (smooth diurnal variation), allowing Fourier series expansion: exp[-τ_{Rayleigh}] = Σa_n cos(nωt). The cloud term contains stochastic fluctuations: exp[-τ_{cloud}} = 1 + ε(t) where ε(t) is stationary for ARMA modeling. This matches the paper's method: 'The stationarity...is ensured by removing the deterministic component'. The ARMA(p,q) model then operates on the residual ε(t) = k_t - k_t^{deterministic}, with autocorrelation determined by cloud advection timescales.",

    "question_text": "Explain how Kolmogorov turbulence scaling affects the optimal spatial resolution for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) solar forecasts using WRF model dynamics.",
    "standard_answer": "The Kolmogorov energy cascade dictates that turbulent kinetic energy E(k) ∝ k^{-5/3} where k is wavenumber. For WRF modeling, the resolvable scale l must satisfy l < L/2 (Nyquist criterion) where L is grid spacing. Solar irradiance fluctuations are dominated by eddies at the cloud integral scale (~1km). Using Kolmogorov's 2/3 law: ΔG ∝ l^{1/3}, requiring L < 2km to resolve 90% of variance. However, as noted in the paper, 'NWP models are used mainly for DA forecasts' where computational cost limits resolution to L~3-10km. This explains their higher nRMSE (~40.4%) versus CM models (~22.8%) - the unresolved subgrid scales introduce errors proportional to (L/l_c)^{5/3} where l_c is cloud scale. Hybrid models improve this by adding stochastic parameterizations of E(k) for k > k_{max}.",
