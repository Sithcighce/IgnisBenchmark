Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) holds the flexible potentials for waste biorefinery, pollutants removal, CO2
capture, and bioelectrosynthesis of clean and renewable electrofuels or valuable chemical commodities,
dealing with the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental deterioration issues. Although substantial
advances in process design and mechanisms exploration have greatly promoted the development of MEC
platform from a concept to a technology, how to virtually utilize it in real-world scenario remains a big chal-
lenge. There are numerous technical issues ahead for MEC to be tackled towards up-scaling and real imple-
mentations. This review article presents a state-of-the-art overview of the fundamental aspects and the
latest breakthrough results and accomplishments obtained from the MEC platform, with a special emphasis
on mapping the key extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms between electroactive microorgan-
isms and electrode surface (including i: cells !e(cid:1)
cells). A unified discussion of dif-
ferent process design: inoculation methods for rapid start-up, role of membranes, modification of cathode
materials, cathodic catalysts (i.e. noble, un-noble metal catalysts and biocatalysts) as well as designs and
configurations of versatile bioelectrochemical cells, is also involved. Finally, the major challenges and tech-
nical problems encountered throughout MEC researches are analyzed, and recommendations and future
needs for the virtual utilization of MEC technology in real waste treatment are elaborated.

1. Introduction

PGlobal energy supply continues to be problematic. The United
States Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that global
energy needs will increase by 57% during the 2004(cid:1)2030 period
[1], which aggravates energy shortage and global warming. Today's
planet is at a critical stage in its efforts to combat energy crisis and
environmental deterioration. A growing awareness and concerns
over energy security promote the scientists worldwide to seek new
energy supplies. Renewable energy sources represent sustainable
and carbon-neutral alternatives to carbon-based fossil
fuels to
tackle this issue, alleviating the dependence on fossil fuels and
ensuring the energy security. As per International Energy Agency
(IEA)’s latest report [2], it is predicted that nearly 60% of all power
generation capacity by 2040 will come from renewable energy. Bio-
energy technologies that use renewable sources to produce biofuels
or chemical commodities will play a role in our planet's energy
security [3].

PBioelectrochemical systems (BES) are regarded as an emerging
and promising strategy for sustainable energy production. According
to the direct of electron transfer, BES includes two categories, i.e.
microbial fuel cells (MFC) and microbial electrolysis cells (MEC). In
an MFC, electrochemically active microorganisms (i.e. exoelectro-
gens) on the anode oxidize biodegradable organic compounds
(mainly acetate) in renewable energy sources such as wastewaters,
extracellularly transferring electrons to the anode and producing
electrical current [4,5]. In contrast, an MEC, as does photosynthesis
[6], utilizes metals or electroactive biofilms (i.e. “electrotrophs”)
attached to the cathode as catalysts [7] to convert chemical energy
in low-grade biomass into hydrogen gas (referred to as “electro-
hydrogenesis”) while remediating contaminants [8], or to electro-
synthesize a wide variety of the carbon-natural electrofuels or
industrially useful chemicals from the wasted CO2 (named “electro-
methangenesis”) [4,9] which captures, recycles and utilizes CO2
while mitigating the greenhouse effect (GHE) [10]. Slightly different
from MFC, the bioelectrocatalysis reaction in such a system does
not occur spontaneously, and a small power supply (0.2(cid:1)0.8 V in
practice) needs to be supplied between two electrodes to reduce
thermodynamic barrier for the wastes biorefinery and electrofuels
bioconversion. Regarding the external power supply, except the
commonly used potentiostat or DC power, other alternative renew-
able energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal or tide can also
be applied in this system, via which both natural energy and bioen-
ergy are stored in the form of transportable fuels simultaneously
(Fig. 1). Notably, the MEC system possesses great potential as a
green, sustainable and flexible energy producer. These distinct,

Punique features of MEC clearly align this process with the principles
of environmental sustainability and green chemistry.

PThe MEC research is a highly new cross-discipline involving envi-
ronmental engineering, biochemistry, bioelectrochemistry, micro-
biology, materials science, and molecular biology as well [11]. The
advances made in the relevant fields have motivated the great
research interests in this concept. During the past decade, MEC as a
new platform technology for producing the highly versatile electro-
fuels and/or valuable chemicals such as hydrogen, methane, formate,
acetate, alcohols and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or for the removal
of different organic and inorganic contaminants has gained the ever-
growing concerns in the scientific community [10,12(cid:1)19], inducing
the tremendous achievements in both mechanisms exploration
and journal publications. To date, there have been several excellent
review articles that summarized the current advances in this field,
with the specific emphasis related to substrates [20], electrode
materials [21], cathodic catalysts [22,23], electroactive biofilm and
microbial community [24,25], extracellular electron transfer (EET)
mechanisms [7,26,27], reactor architectures, functions and opera-
tional performance [3,28(cid:1)30], as well as commercial viability
[31,32]. These reviews provide critical appraisal and in-depth
insights, and propose new ideals and recommendations for future
directions, making outstanding contribution to MEC development.
However, the present efforts hardly keep pace with the encouraging
accomplishments, as indicated by the exponential growth in
research papers available. Moreover, the majority of previous
reviews give grant concerns to H2 harvest from wastewaters [3,30],
with obviously few attentions paid to the versatile capabilities and
potentials of MEC platform in CO2 electromethanogenesis or electro-
synthesis for other multi-carbon electrofuels, as well as in seawater
desalination, etc. For instance, Albo et al. [10] recently evaluated the
economic and environmental benefits of CO2 electroreduction pro-
cess, but with particular focus on methanol electrosynthesis. Nowa-
days, the huge amounts of CO2 emission (e.g. 35.7 Gt CO2 in 2014)
and resultant global warming further necessitate the comprehensive
understanding of the CO2 electrochemical reduction to diverse valu-
able products. In addition, the thermodynamic working principles
and electrocatalytic routes underlying the different bioelectrochemi-
cal processes still remain not clearly recognized, although some
efforts have already been devoted [7,13,25,26].

PIn this review, the working principles and present progress of
MEC in the electroproduction of a variety of electrofuels from waste
streams are overviewed. The routes and rates of extracellular elec-
tron transfer (EET) between electroactive microorganisms and elec-
trode surface are the decisive factors influencing the electrofuels
yields and conversion efficiencies. Thus,
this article will also

the scientific challenges and future opportunities and needs ahead
for the virtual utilization of MEC technology in real-world scenarios
are elaborated as well.

2. Working principles and bioelectrochemical dynamics of MEC
platform

2.1. General description

PEarly in 1910, M.C. Potter discovered the concomitant production
of electric current associated with microbial catabolism, for the first
time experimentally demonstrating the capability of microorgan-
isms to transport electrons extracellularly when degrading organic
compounds [33,34]. The first microbial fuel cell (MFC) was built by
Cohen in 1931 [35] and then patented by Davis in 1967 [36]. How-
ever, the importance of the work was not recognized until the
energy crisis got worse globally in late1990s, re-stimulating the con-
cerns in biofuel cells; since then the research activities with MFC as
topics began to blossom resulting in an exponential increment in the
number of publications. For more details of MFC designs, fundamen-
tals of voltage generation and operating principles, the readers are
referred to Logan et al. [37]. The concept of microbial electrolysis
cell (MEC) was originated in 2005 (Fig. 2). Two different research
groups independently noticed the production of hydrogen gas in an
electrolysis-type process modified from MFC nearly at the same
time [29,38,39]. This process has previously been named as “electro-
chemically assisted microbial reactor (BEAMR)”, then “biocatalyzed
electrolysis”. Finally,
it was defined as “electrohydrogenesis” or
“microbial electrolysis” to distinguish the hydrogen evolution in an
MEC from dark fermentation [12,29,40]. Shortly afterwards, the

Pfunction of MEC for CO2 bioconversion to methane was discovered
as well, this is, “electromethanogenesis” that we now know [4,9].
Based on these initial efforts, a great deal of MEC configurations with
different purposes have been designed and proposed very recently,
such as microbial electrodialysis cell (MEDC), microbial reverse-
electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC), microbial desalination cell
(MDC), etc., greatly extending the scope of MEC applications. From
then onwards, a new era belonging to MEC is approaching.

2.2. Bioelectrochemical dynamics in MEC

P2.2.1. Electrohydrogenesis

PHydrogen gas (H2) is a clean energy carrier. The commonly
reported alternative for hydrogen gas production from renewable
biomass and wastewaters can be dark fermentation. Although fer-
mentation process is relatively well-studied and feasible, the organic
compounds suitable for recovering hydrogen are quite limited; to
date, only materials rich in carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose,
cellulose, and starch [41] are preferred substrates. Moreover, hydro-
gen yields are usually low because of considerable co-production of
non-fermentative organics, e.g. volatile acids such as acetate and
butyrate, along with solvents such as ethanol, acetone and butanol,
etc. Further conversion of the “dead-end” metabolites, such as acetic
acid, to hydrogen gas cannot be accomplished by bacteria without
additional energy input [42] due to thermodynamical limitations
(cid:1) + H+ + 4H2, 4G0’ = +104.6 kJ reaction(cid:1)1
(CH3COO(cid:1) + 4H2O ! 2HCO3
[43]). For example, only a maximum of 4 mol H2 can be recovered per
mole of glucose if acetate is the final fermentation end-product; it
will reduce to 2 mol(cid:1)1-glucose when the end-product is butyrate
despite a stoichiometric potential of 12 mol H2 mol(cid:1)1-glucose [38, 43].
PElectrohydrogenesis is able to overcome the endothermic barrier
for hydrogen evolution by imposing an extra energy. In MEC process,
anode respiring bacteria (ARB, or exoelectrogens) populated at the
anodic biofilms decompose organic compounds into bicarbonate,
protons and electrons; the electrons by means of such small energy
input, in addition to that ((cid:1)0.300 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode
(SHE)) produced by ARB [44], are transferred to the cathode and

(0 V), and pH2 is the hydrogen partial pressure (1 atm). Therefore,
the equilibrium voltage (Eeq) for acetate under typical operating
conditions can be calculated as:
Eeq 1⁄4 Ecat (cid:1)Ean 1⁄4 (cid:1)0:414

ð5Þ
PThe negative Eeq clearly implies that the conversion of remaining
acetate to hydrogen is not spontaneous. Thermodynamic limitations
thus make dark fermentation less cost-efficient to harvest energy
from renewable biomass. That means that to drive the hydrogen
evolution via electrohydrogenesis, an additional theoretical voltage
of >0.114 V has to be supplied. Under operational conditions, the
applied voltage (Eap, 0.2(cid:1)0.8 V in practice) would be larger than Eeq

Þ 1⁄4 (cid:1)0:114 V

Pbecause of voltage or energy losses, mainly arising from bacterial
metabolic losses, activation losses, ohmic losses, and mass transport
losses in the system [28,29]. For instance, Rozendal et al. [39] applied
a voltage of 0.5 V to obtain 0.02 m3 H2 m(cid:1)3-reactor liquid volume
day(cid:1)1 from acetate, with voltage loss of 0.04 V at the anode, 0.01 V
as a result of membrane and ohmic resistance, and >0.28 V at the
cathode (Fig. 3). Nonetheless, the voltage is typically lower com-
pared with that required for water splitting (1.23 V) [47].

P2.2.2. Electromethanogenesis

PAnother possible application of MEC is the electrocatalysis reduc-
tion of carbon dioxide to methane (CH4), namely electromethano-
genesis above mentioned. Methane is an excellent and popular fuel
that is being widely used all over the world. In electromethanogenic
MEC process (Fig. 4), the protons and electrons released from the
anodic oxidation of organic matters (or water in some instances [9])

In theory, methane electrosynthesis
from the reduction of CO2 can occur under typical biochemical con-
ditions (pH = 7.0, and T = 298.15 K) by means of direct extracellular
electron transfer (EET) between electrotrophs and cathode at the
Ecat of (cid:1)0.244 V vs. SHE (Eq. (5)) [9,48(cid:1)50], or indirect EET at
(cid:1)0.414 V vs. SHE with the help of abiotic hydrogen gas (i.e. step i:

where E0

(0.169 V) [4], and pCH4 and pCO2 are the partial pressure of methane
and carbon dioxide, respectively (1 atm). Thus, the equilibrium volt-
age (Eeq) for carbon dioxide reduction under typical conditions can
be estimated as:

Pwith decreasing cathode potential. Considerable methane yield
was achieved at a poised potential of (cid:1)0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, being
2.30 § 0.34 mL after 5 h of operation with a faradaic efficiency of
24.2 § 4.7%. To promote methane productivity, Zhen and co-workers
[48] later presented a hybrid biocathode covered with graphite felt
(GF), and equipped it in a two-chamber MEC for CO2 conversion, and
they observed methane yield of roughly 80.9 mL L(cid:1)1 after 24 h of
incubation; but the cathodic potential should be set at or below
(cid:1)1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl.

PFrom these preliminary studies done before, it can be said that
electromethanogenesis shows great promise and many advantages
for methane production especially when compared to traditional
alternatives such as anaerobic digestion because it (i) runs at ambi-
ent temperature without heating, thereby reducing energy input
[3,58], (ii) exploits very simple inorganic chemicals (CO2 and H+/H2)
as substrates [51,52] while accomplishing the reduction of CO2 emis-
sions, (iii) produces methane with low content in carbon dioxide and
other impurities [50], and more importantly (iv) has no severe tech-
nical issues, such as slow hydrolysis and/or volatile acids accumula-
tion [53,59,60] that often happen during anaerobic processes of the
complex organics.

PEq. (7) means that electromethanogenesis of carbon dioxide in an
acetate-fed MEC, in principle, can occur spontaneously (+0.056), or
by adopting a small voltage same as electrohydrogenesis. A plenty of
works with methane as the target have been reported successfully
[4,51,54,55]. The most representative work should be those under-
taken by Prof. Logan's group [4], who for the first time described the
production of methane from carbon dioxide using a two-chamber
MEC containing a methanogens-attached biocathode at a set cathode
potential. As found for electrohydrogenesis, however, electrometha-
nogenesis will be affected by quite large energy or voltage losses as
well. Due to large overpotentials and imperfect electrode materials
used, more negative cathodic potentials of less than (cid:1)0.7 V vs.
Ag/AgCl (+0.201 V vs. SHE) [56,57] are often poised for perceptible
methane production. Moreover, in spite of relatively negative poten-
tials applied, electromethanosynthesis efficiencies often vary con-
siderably, with coulombic efficiency (g CE) ranging from 23.1% to 96%
[4,51,53]. Zhen et al. [9] run a two-chamber MEC equipped with a
carbon biocathode. Methane production substantially increased

PThe performance of MEC process is closely related to the type and
source of inocula, membrane type, electrode materials, and cells
configurations. Therefore, the scaling-up of MEC systems toward the
commercial applications will require further understanding and
optimizations of operational parameters, electrode materials and
MEC architectures.

3.1. Inoculation for rapid MEC start-up

PThe source, electroactivity of inoculum, as well as subsequent
enrichment and acclimation methods seem to be of great impor-
tance for the start-up, process stability, energy recovery of an MEC
system. The inoculum can be pure- and/or mixed cultures based on
the research focus. Pure cultures (e.g. Shewanella sp., Geobacter sp.,
etc.) are mostly used for the principle studies, e.g. extracellular elec-
tron transfer mechanisms (direct or indirect) [26,61,62], since it
allows targeting the key enzymes, cytochromes involved easily and
accurately. In addition, the use of pure cultures shows great promise
when degrading a selected pollutant [63] or bioelectrosynthesizing a
given product [64]. This, however, is impractical for commercial

Papplications such as wastewater treatment because the incubation
and enrichment of pure cultures is time-consuming, also expensive.
Moreover, wastewater contains a wide range of complex organic
matters, which are hardly possible for pure cultures to completely
oxidize without the syntrophy with other fermenters [44]. A syntro-
phic consortium between exoelectrogens and fermentative partners
would favor the decomposition and bioconversion of macromole-
cules to readily biodegradable substrates and allow a subsequent
effective utilization [65]. Up to now, only strain Rhodoferax ferriredu-
cens has been reported to show the potential in the complete miner-
alization of glucose [66]. Based on the above reasons, the mixed
cultures with a variety of microorganisms will thus be more cost-
effective for inoculation. However, in some cases the co-existence
of some non-electrogenic bacteria (e.g. sulfate reducing bacteria,
denitrifying bacteria, etc.) in the mixed cultures utilizes part of
substrates, thus potentially reducing electron and energy recovery
efficiencies [63,67].

PThe start-up of bioelectrochemical systems is a long and labori-
ous process. To facilitate the rapid start-up of MEC, various inocula-
tion strategies have been proposed: (i) use of a well-enriched
bioanode from an existing MFC [38,40,44,54,65], which realizes a
rapid start-up, but it will take time if used as biocathode because of
the reverse electron transfer directions; (ii) direct addition of inocu-
lum to incubate a MEC [9,68]; and (iii) pre-enrichment and develop-
ment of new biofilm before being used via using pure cultures, the
outlet (planktonic cells) of an MEC, MFC or upflow anaerobic sludge
blanket (UASB) [16,69(cid:1)72], anaerobic sludge [68], sediment [17],
wastewater [73], or biofilm scarped from the bioanode [42] as the
inocula. In a previous work, Zaybak et al. [74] presented a simple
enrichment procedure comprised of the pre-enrichment of micro-
flora with glucose first in batch culture (2 weeks) and then in
cathodic chamber (2 weeks) for enhancing start-up of anaerobic
autotrophic biocathodes. Following that, Patil et al. [71] enriched a
mixed microbial community from an MFC and a UASB in serum bot-
tles on H2: CO2 (70: 30; 50 kPa overpressure; 31 days) for the micro-
bial electrosynthesis of acetate. The enrichment approach enabled
instant start-up of electrosynthesis process and reproducible acetate
production, with the maximum being up to 1.5 g L¡1 at a fixed

Pcurrent of ¡5 Am¡2. In accordance with the similar procedure,
LaBarge et al. [75] pre-acclimated electrotrophic microbes using
granular activated carbon (GAC) for CO2 electromethanogenesis.
Pre-enrichment with GAC supported an effective growth of electro-
active communities,
improved methane generation rates, and
decreased start-up time in MEC. The approaches reportedly show
many advantages in lab-scale tests; but the further improvement is
required for future applications in the real-world scenarios.

3.2. Membranes and separators

PUsually, MEC exploits an ion exchange membrane (IEM) to sepa-
rate the compartments of the anode and the cathode. The applica-
tion of a membrane unit provides many benefits. In a hydrogen-
producing MEC, for example, the inclusion of membrane prevents
H2 pollution by gaseous by-products (CO2, H2S, etc.) from anodic res-
piration, and minimizes diffusional H2 loss and recycling, ensuring
high purity of hydrogen gas [46]. For an MEC system with liquid-
phase electrofuels, such as acetate, as the target products, the use of
membrane seems particularly necessary since it retards the diffusion
of produced acetate toward the anode chamber and subsequent re-
consumption by the exoelectrogens colonizing the bioanode.
Besides, the presence of membrane between anode and cathode
eliminates the danger of short-circuiting [28]. At present, the most
popular membrane is Nafion
117, one type of cation exchange
membrane (CEM) (Fig. 5a), which has been universally examined for
the production of versatile value-added electro-products [48,76].
This membrane is also called proton exchange membrane (PEM)
since it has been designed to transfer protons (H+) [45]. One of major
concerns associated with the feasibility of PEM is low proton con-
ductivity due to the presence of typically 4 ¡ 5 orders of magnitude
higher concentrations of multiple competitive cations (Na+, K+,
+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) in solution [29, 46]. In this context, this mate-
NH4
rial tends to conduct the cations other than protons, eventually
inducing a pH drop in the anode chamber and an increase in the
cathode chamber that affects the performance. Besides, the high cost
(around $32.00/10.0 £ 10.0 cm, Ion Power Inc., USA) is another major
barrier limiting its use in large-scale MEC systems.

POther membranes reported up to date are several cation
exchange membranes (CEM) such as CMI 7000 (Membranes Interna-
tional, Glen Rock, NJ) [77], Selemion CSO (AGC Engineering, Japan)
[9] and Selemion CMV [73], anion exchange membranes (AEM) (e.g.
Selemion AMV (AGC Engineering Co., Japan) [73,78]; FAA-PK [79],
Fumasep
FAB [46], both from FuMA-Tech GmbH, Germany; AMI
7001, Membranes International, Glen Rock, NJ [80]; AMI 7001S,
Membranes International INC [81]), as well as microporous mem-
brane (RhinoHide, Entek Ltd., UK) [82] and bipolar membrane (BPM)
(Fumasep-FBM, FuMA-Tech GmbH, Germany) [83,84]. It has been
shown that utilizing an AEM can substantially increase MEC perfor-
mance in comparison with CEM because of its alternative ion trans-
port properties and higher ionic conductivities [46,85,86]. AEM
allows for the transport of protons with the assistance of phosphate
2¡ in the anode and/or trans-
anions [29,42]. In this process, HPO4
¡ and the
ported from the cathode can react with H+ to form H2PO4
monobasic phosphate carries protons and then is then transported
back to the cathode (Fig. 5b) [87,88]. This thus better stabilizes the
solution pH levels, minimizing the performance loss caused by pH
gradient. Sleutels et al. [85] compared the performance of a dual
chamber MEC containing either a CEM (Fumasep
FKE) or an AEM
(Fumasep
FAA). They concluded that AEM-MEC outperformed
CEM-MEC in terms of increasing H2 generation (2.1 vs. 0.4 m3-
H2 m¡3 d¡1 at 1 V) and lowering internal
resistance (192 vs.
435 mV m2). A major drawback for an AEM is substrate (e.g. acetate)
crossover from the anode to the cathode because of substantial con-
centration gradient [86]. A bipolar membrane (BPM) typically con-
sists of an anionic and cationic selective layer stacked in series [89].
It allows for the simultaneous transport of protons to the cathode
and hydroxide ions to the anode to balance charge and the involve-
ment of BPM is also considered effective to prevent pH gradient
(Fig. 5c) [90]. However, the potential is incomparable to that of AEM.
One of the recent reports of a comparison of MEC containing AEM vs.
CEM vs. BPM is by Gildemyn et al. [91]. The results indicate that BPM
suffered from the severe pH drop in the catholyte, followed by CEM;
by contrast, the catholyte pH in the reactor equipped with AEM
remained stable, producing the highest acetic acid yield with the
lowest energy input. The similar observation was reported previ-
ously by Harnisch et al. [92], who claimed that BPM was the least
suitable for biofuel cell application among four types of membranes
(PEM Nafion-117, CEM Ultrex CMI7000, AEM Fumasep FAD, and
BPM Fumasep FBM), as it showed the highest polarization without
being able to prevent pH splitting.

PAlthough, the use of a membrane assures a stable environment
for bacteria growth and high purity for products, it brings several
technical challenges to bioelectrochemial systems, e.g. pH gradient
across the membrane, lowered mass transfer rate associated with
membrane fouling, increased internal resistance and considerable
voltage losses [46]. For instance, every pH unit difference will
increase Eeq by 0.06 V according to the Nernst equation, which
means an additional energy input of ca. 0.13 kWh m3-H2 per pH unit
[29]. The technical issues not only bring economic and environmen-
tal burden but also greatly limit the overall reaction rate and produc-
tivities. An alternative to avoid pH imbalance is the recirculation of
the electrolytes between anode and cathode chamber [73,93], how-
ever, this makes the construction and operation of an MEC platform
more complicated. Practical implementation of MEC technologies
requires the operation at low cost. The first attempt of eliminating
membrane in hydrogen-producing MEC was performed by Call et al.
[40]. They hypothesized that membrane was not necessarily needed
in such system for several reasons. First, unlike a water electrolyzer,
oxygen is not produced at the anode and thus there is no need to
separate the gas produced at the cathode from the anode. Second, if
hydrogen production rate is sufficiently high, the microbial conver-
sion of hydrogen gas by methane-producing bacteria in the anode
chamber will be negligible because of its low solubility in water.

PThird, they reasoned that even if hydrogen gas was lost, the lack of
membrane might reduce internal resistance, minimize capital and
operational expenses of the system and simplify reactor architec-
ture, thereby enhancing the MEC's industrial competitiveness. The
favorable feature of membrane-less MEC system for hydrogen pro-
duction was further confirmed by Hu et al. [94], who demonstrated
that high hydrogen recoveries were possible without a membrane.
Therefore, from a practical implementation perspective, the omis-
sion of a membrane would be technically more feasible and reliable.
Nonetheless, the proliferation of methanogens is still one of the
major issues associated with a single chamber MEC. Methanogens
compete with exoelectrogens for substrate (acetate) and consume
product (H2) to produce methane, giving rise to a specific thermody-
namic energy loss of roughly 15% owing to lower combustion energy
of methane. To address this issue, till date researchers have recom-
mended multiple strategies to inhibit the methanogens growth and
activities, such as addition of chemical inhibitors like 2-bromoetha-
nesulfonate, 2-chloroethane sulfonate, or 8-aza-hypoxanthine,
pH control, periodical exposure of bioelectrodes to air, lowering
hydrogen retention time by continuous nitrogen sparging, etc.
[65,69,72,94]. Nonetheless, the CH4 contamination of H2 still is a
major obstacle due to the unavoidable methane production [30].
Another method of avoiding the consumption of hydrogen is the
employment of pure bacteria culture, as recommended by Hu et al.
[94]. They demonstrated the hydrogen production from lactic acid
by S. oneidensis MR-1 without the formation of CH4, but hydrogen
production rates were quite low in comparison with the mixed cul-
ture. Further fundamental research in producing high-grade pure
hydrogen in membrane-less MEC is needed and several technologi-
cal bottlenecks remain to be overcome.

3.3. Tailoring and modifying electrode materials (cathode)

PAs the core component of MEC platform, the properties of the
used electrodes affect, and even govern microbial attachment, inter-
nal resistance, electron transfer at the electrode surface and cathode
reaction dynamics. Carbon-based materials are the earliest and
by far still the most frequently utilized type of electrodes in bioelec-
trochemical systems, because of their low capital cost, ease of manu-
large specific surface area, good conductivity, superior
facture,
biocompatibility with electroactive microflora, and high chemical
stability [23,28]. It can be produced at comparatively low costs from
biological and chemical polymer precursors via carbonation [95].
Carbon-based electrodes are versatile in shape and configuration. By
far, the commonly reported carbon-based materials include plain
graphite rod [9,96], carbon cloth [55,65], carbon paper [38], graphite
felt [48,97], granular activated carbon [75], graphite granules [57],
graphite fiber brush [40,53,80], and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
[98,99]. These materials can be used as both anodes and cathodes in
bioelectrochemical systems [29].

PPhotographs of these materials are given in Fig. 6. Table 1 sum-
marizes their configuration and some references that have utilized
them. Graphite rod has good electrical conductivity, chemical stabil-
ity and low cost but low porosity and specific surface area. Carbon
paper is very thin and easy to connect wiring but has low durability
and strength [95]. Carbon cloth is much more flexible and porous,
providing a high-surface for microbial growth [100]. However, the
relatively high cost (ca. $1000 m¡2) increases the difficulties for scale
up, making the electrode impractical for most MEC/MFC applications
[101]. Hence, the use of these materials presents substantial chal-
lenges for commercial development. In comparison, carbon mesh
has a substantially low cost of $10(cid:1)25 m¡2 [102]. Carbon mesh with
a mixture of poly(dimethylsiloxane) and carbon black as a diffusion
layer produced a maximum power density of 1355 § 62 mW m¡2-
cathode, similar to that obtained with a carbon cloth cathode
(1390 § 72 mW m¡2). Note that the cost of this material is only 2.5

Pof the cost of the carbon cloth cathode [101], hinting that carbon
mesh is a less expensive and promising alternative to carbon cloth.
Graphite felt is another fiber fabric much thicker. This material pos-
sesses good electronic conduction [103], high strength, open 3D
structure [104] and significant fiber interconnectivity, and has been
adopted as electrodes in different electrochemical cells such as MEC
[48], MFC [105], vanadium redox flow batteries [106], biosensor
[107], etc. The major deficiencies of using graphite felt come from
large resistance and low mass transfer rate on the inner surface.
Activated carbon (AC) has distinct advantages, such as low cost, high
surface area, and high catalytic activity at neutral pH, which makes
it an attractive and cost-effective candidate to replace the costly
noble metal catalysts (e.g. Pt) [108]. A single-chamber MFC with an
AC air-cathode obtained a Pmax of >25 W m¡3 and nitrobenzene
removal of over 97% [109]. A previous work even demonstrated that
the addition of granular AC could promote electron exchange via
interspecies hydrogen or formate transfer between Geobacter metal-
lireducens and Geobacter sulfurreducens and greatly stimulated etha-
nol metabolism and methane production [110]. In order to improve
the microbial adhesion and the bio-electron transfer, Logan et al.
[111] arranged a new electrode named graphite fiber brush, by cut-
ting carbon fibers to a set length and winding them around a twisted
conductive but noncorrosive titanium wires. The electrode exhibits
a high specific surface area, high conductivity, and an open and
porous structure to avoid biofouling. The other benefits of the brush
electrode are relatively inexpensive and easy to fabricate. Over the
past ten years, this electrode has gained huge attractiveness and
been used in a number of experiments for a wide range of purposes
[112]. Moreover, combining with graphite granules or carbon mesh
could further improve the performance of graphite fiber brush, and
enhance and stabilize effectiveness of the reactor [113,114]. One
study observed that the composite anode produced 20% higher

Ppower densities than MFC using only brush, and 150% power densi-
ties compared to carbon mesh anode [114]. Another emerging car-
bon-based electrode material is carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Since the
discovery of CNTs, they has been recognized as excellent catalyst
support, presumably attributable to their high surface area, impres-
sive electronic conductivity, high strength, chemical inertness, ease
of functionalization with different groups that simplify reactions,
low capital cost and high electrochemical activity [95,98,99,115].
Today, CNTs is gaining growing popularity in electrode design
because of their interesting morphology and superior properties. A
recent work conducted by Erbay et al. [116] synthesized 3D porous
CNT sponges via one-step chemical vapor deposition process. It has
been shown that the nano-material enhanced charge transfer
between the CNT sponge electrode and microbial biofilm, in addition
to large surface areas and favorable p-p interactions between micro-
bial nanowires and CNTs. The Pmax in this study was 2150 W m¡3,
comparable to those of commercial 3D carbon felt under the same

composites
achieved a high hydrogen production rate of
0.67 m¡3 m¡3 d¡1 and COD removal of 86.8% [99]. Jiang et al. [115]
also demonstrated that PANI/MWNT composites could be a suitable
alternative to a Pt/C catalyst in MFC.

PHowever, despite the unique characteristics, the electric conduc-
tivity of carbon-based materials has two to three orders of magni-
tude below that of most metals, e.g. 3 £ 104(cid:1)1 £ 105 S m(cid:1)1 of
polycrystalline graphite vs. 58 £ 106 S m(cid:1)1 of copper [121], which
hinders their ability to achieve high performance with bioelectro-
chemical systems. As a consequence, they, when used solely for
cathodes, usually require a high cathodic over-potential for driving
electrohydrogenesis [23,29] or electromethanogenesis [9,48]. Coat-
ing thin layers of noble metal catalysts such as Pt [39,42,65], Pd

P[122] and Au [123], or metal complex catalysts, holds the great
potentials to reduce the over-potential and improve the electro-
chemical efficiencies of carbon materials by lowering the activation
energy threshold due to excellent catalytic activity. At present, Pt-
catalyzed carbon cloth (Pt/C) is the most popular catalyst-decorated
cathode, which is commercially available (e.g. Fuel Cell Store, USA;
ElectroChem Inc., USA) and can also be prepared in the laboratory
[124]. The major challenges associated with Pt catalyst are the high
cost, scarcity [23], and risk of being poisoned by chemicals such as
sulfide in waste streams [29], which limit its applications to only the
lab-level. Moreover, in most cases, the life span of these catalysts is
short, usually less than 100 h, which is far below requirements for
practical engineering applications [22]. In this context, the commer-
cialization of microbial electrosynthesis techniques requires further
optimizations of electrode materials and development of new and
cost-effective multifunctional catalysts.

PTo reduce the cost and over-potential loss of the cathode while
implementing MEC technology in practice, different types of nonpre-
cious metal materials have been tested and proposed as alternatives
to Pt catalyst, such as stainless steel [12,125], nickel (Ni) [52,126],
titanium (Ti) [126], nano-Ni(OH)2 [127], molybdenum disulfide
(MoS2) [52,128], Si-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles [129], copper loaded
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [130], plasma-treated Cu foil [131], Sn/
SnOx [132], etc. As an example, Xiao et al. [133] prepared a novel
nitrogen-containing core-shell-structured catalyst N-Fe/Fe3C@C, and
used it to modify carbon cloth; the catalyst significantly improved
hydrogen production compared with unmodified cathode and car-
bon nanotubes. Although not as efficient as Pt catalyst, the catalyst
exhibited extremely low cost (less than 5% of the Pt/C catalyst), mak-
ing it attractive for large-scale MEC operation. Zhang et al. [6] func-
tionalized carbon cloth with several metal or non-metal materials to
enhance electrode(cid:1)microbe electron transfer for improving rates of
microbial electrosynthesis; they observed that functionalization
with chitosan or cyanuric chloride increased acetate production
rates 6(cid:1)7-fold and modification with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane,

Ppolyaniline, cotton or polyester fabric treated with carbon nanotubes
gave rates »3-fold higher than untreated controls; meanwhile, treat-
ing carbon cloth with metal, in particular gold, palladium, or nickel
nanoparticles, promoted electrosynthesis, with electrosynthesis
rates being 6-, 4.7- or 4.5-fold faster than the untreated control,
respectively. They demonstrated that modifying cathode surface
properties improve microbe-electrode interactions is an effective
approach to increase rates of CO2 in microbial electrosynthesis and
subsequent acetate production (Fig. 7). Lu et al. [134] grow NiFe lay-
ered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) film on nickel foam via one-step
in-situ hydrothermal growth method, and the new cathode showed
HER (2.01(cid:1)2.12 m3-H2 m¡3 d¡1) approaching Pt-loaded carbon
cloth, and being twice of stainless steel mesh and bare nickel foam.
For more detail of chemical catalysts for the microbial electrosynthe-
sis of multi-carbon electrofuels, the readers are referred to Qiao et al.
[22].

PAnother strategy to approach the goal is development of “bioca-
thode” via using electroactive microorganisms as biocatalysts, which
is currently the most attractive and of great promise option; and the
common methods to incubate a biocathode have been summarized
in Section 3.1. At a biocathode, the biocatalysts are able to use the
electrode as an electron source to drive the reaction of electrons,
protons (and CO2) to form hydrogen or low-carbon products. The
first biocathode was enriched and reported by Rozendal and co-
workers in 2008 for hydrogen evolution [135]. They observed that
the biocathode produced 0.63 m3-H2 m¡3 d¡1 at a cathodic hydrogen
efficiency of 49% compared to 0.08 m3-H2 m¡3 d¡1 at a cathodic
hydrogen efficiency of 25% obtained using a control electrode, con-
firming the potential of electroactive bacteria as biocatalysts. After
that, the studies relation to biocathode have spread everywhere
[24,48,70,136]. In a subsequent study of MEC, Fu et al. [55] devel-
oped a biocathode catalyzing electromethanogenesis by inoculation
with thermophiles at 0.8 V and 55 °C; after the initial enrichment,
the biocathode was further acclimated in a two-chamber reactor
operated at a potential of ¡0.5 V vs. SHE for another 160 h to

Pimprove the electromethanogenic activity. After the second-phase's
incubation, the electrocatalytic culture comprised of a Methanother-
mobacter-related methanogen and synergistetes- and thermotogae-
related bacteria developed successfully, which reduced cathodic
overpotentials via improving electrode-microbe electron transfer
and enhanced CH4 electrosynthesis rate by approximately 6-fold. By
selective enrichment of microbial community (Fig. 8), Patil et al. [71]
also achieved an efficient cathodic biofilm, which showed satisfac-
tory biological redox activity and produced considerably high ace-
tate (maximum up to 1.5 g L¡1) compared with the abiotic control.
Besides, a further improvement in the bioelectrocatalytic perfor-
mance can be obtained by modifying electrode surface properties, e.
g., anchoring nickel nanowires to graphite afforded the development
of cathodic Sporomusa biofilm and the interaction between cathode
surface and microbial biofilm, thereby increasing the biocatalyzed
reduction of CO2 to acetate by a 2.3-fold over the untreated graphite
[137]. Jourdin et al. [138] manufactured a highly conductive scaffold
by direct growth of flexible multiwalled carbon nanotubes on reticu-
lated vitreous carbon (NanoWeb-RVC), which enhanced bacterial
attachment and biofilm development and resulted in 1.7- and 2.6-
fold higher current density and acetate bioproduction rate versus a
carbon plate control. Notably, the biocathode with microorganisms
as catalysts has many merits over metal catalysts and abiotic catho-
des, in terms of capital cost, biocatalytic activity, resistance to envi-
ronmental variation, and long-term operational stability [79].
Robustness of electrochemically-active biocatalysts can thus be a
central aspect towards practical applications of biocathodes [139].
Besides, an evaluation of the suitability of an electrode material
should integrate environmental and economic considerations. The
preparation of biocathode is energy saving, carbon negative, clean
and pollution-free, thus in good accordance with the requirements
of sustainability and green chemistry. In this regard, it can be
expected that with the advances in bio-catalyzed electrochemistry,

Pthe bio-catalyzed MEC process will represent great promise and
attractiveness in realizing chemical energy harvesting from real
wastes in continuous flow, field-scale mode and stimulating its
industrialization in the near future.

3.4. Basic configurations of MEC platform and bioelectrochemical
functions

PIntensive efforts in MEC research have brought about the rapid
advances in not only bioelectrochemical principles but also design of
new platforms. At present, there has been a wide variety of electro-
chemical systems proposed with different configurations and for dif-
ferent purposes (Fig. 9). Table 2 summarizes several representative
findings associated with MEC-related studies for comparison. MEC is
becoming a versatile alternative able to deal with various environ-
mental issues with respect to waste biorefinery, pollutants removal,
CO2 capture/fixation and renewable energy recovery and storage.

P3.4.1. Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC)

PMicrobial electrolysis cell (MEC), derived from MFC, was initially
devised with a focus on initiating H2 evolution (i.e. electrohydrogen-
esis) through proton reduction at the cathode while realizing waste
streams treatment (Fig. 9a). A broad range of waste substrates with
different biodegradability can be used in MEC, from model carbon
sources such as volatile acids [40,42], methanol [81], glucose, glyc-
erol and starch [44,65], to real wastewaters including domestic [76],
swine [120], human urine [73], fermentation [140], saline [79], win-
ery wastewaters [141], landfill leachate [142] and liquid fraction of
pressed municipal solid waste (LPW) [69]. The electrohydrogenesis
efficiencies vary greatly with the types of applied substrates. The
MEC system with easily biodegradable carbon sources would have
high H2 productivity and energy efficiencies. However, in practical
wastewater treatment, the performance may become worse because

Pof the high susceptibility of electrochemically active biofilm. For
instance, recovering H2 from LPW in a single-chamber MEC, Zhen
and co-workers [69] reported a hW-H2 of 21.2 § 2.4% and hW+S-H2 of
15.9 § 2.3% at the optimal conditions (3.0 V and pH 5.5), compared
to the hW-H2 of 194% and hW+S-H2 of 75% for acetate [40], and the
hW-H2 of 283% and hW+S-H2 of 82% for lactate [42]. Call and Logan
[40] documented an overall hydrogen recovery of 49.5 § 11.3% of
CODadded. The other hampers for a successful electrohydrogenesis
for acetate
the competition of methanogenesis
include:
(acetate¡ + H2O ! CH4 + HCO3
¡, 4G0(cid:1)= ¡31.0 kJ reaction(cid:1)1) or H2
(4H2 + CO2 ! CH4 + 2H2O, 4G0(cid:1)= ¡135.6 kJ reaction¡1) to form meth-
ane, and (ii) hydrogen/electron recycling effect occurring between
(cathode: H+ ! H2; anode:
the anode and cathode [69, 143]
H2 + CO2 ! acetate¡ ! e¡ ! current [144] or H2 ! 2H+ + 2e¡ ! cur-
rent [81]), impairing the net hydrogen output and system reliability.
Besides, electron shuttles or mediators such as peptone, yeast
extract containing compounds and amino acid cysteine can also
transfer electron from the cathode to the anode resulting in electron
recycling [145]. It thus requires additional efforts in reducing the

Ppossibility of electron recycling and maximizing electrohydrogenesis
efficiencies in future work [69]. Nevertheless, the MEC has distinct
advantages over traditional hydrogen fermentation for H2 evolution
as it needs comparatively low energy input (0.2(cid:1)1.0 V) compared
with water splitting (1.8 ¡ 2.0 V) [47], and drives nearly stoichiomet-
ric conversion of a substrate to hydrogen versus only 33% by dark
fermentation [44,94].

[96,148,149], methanol

PBy sharing the similar bioelectrochemical principles, MEC can
also biocatalyze the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide
(CO2) at the cathode surface to diverse low-carbon electrofuels such
as methane (CH4) [4,48,55], formic acid (HCOOH) [132,146,147], ace-
tate (CH3COOH)
[10], alcohol
(CH3CH2OH) [14], and ethylene [131]. Electrochemical reduction of
CO2 can proceed through two-, four-, six-, and eight-electron reduc-
tion pathways in gaseous, aqueous, and non-aqueous phases [10,22].
Likewise, the use of cathodic reactions drives the electrosynthesis of
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [150, 151], an important industrial chem-
ical that can be utilized for disinfection, bioremediation, etc.; with
the input of an external voltage of 0.5 V, »1.9 § 0.2 kg-H2O2 m¡3 d¡1

Pwas harvested from acetate at an overall efficiency of 83.1 § 4.8%
[152]. By fabricating a carbon black graphite hybrid air-cathode, Li
et al. [153] observed a H2O2 yield of up to 11.9 mg L¡1 h¡1 cm¡2 at
the current density of 12.3 mA cm¡2 with carbon black to graphite
mass ratio of 1: 5. Not only that, several lines of early researches
have demonstrated the inherent advantages of MEC in metals
removal and recovery (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Co, etc.) [154(cid:1)156], nitro-
gen removal [157], reductive dechlorination of pentachlorophenol
[158], succinic acid conversion from corncob hydrolysate [159], etc.
Besides, MEC was also used for nitrogen and phosphorus recovery
via in-situ struvite-precipitation, named as microbial electrochemi-
cal struvite cell (MESC) [160]. The theoretical cathodic potentials
used to drive the electrosynthesis of various chemicals as well as
pollutants degradation and removal are summarized and depicted in
Fig. 10. Although the present performance is not sufficiently cost-
effective for practice, the “proof-of-concept” studies definitely will
provide a promising avenue for diverse implementations of MEC
platform, thereby enhancing the environmental sustainability and
flexibility of the technique.

P3.4.2. Microbial electrodialysis cell (MEDC)

PMicrobial desalination cell (MDC) is a recently developed method
to seawater desalination by using the electric power produced by
exoelectrogenic bacteria on the anode and oxygen reduction on the
cathode [93,168]. A recent review article gave a comprehensive
overview of MDC as a versatile technology [169]. One limitation for
this approach is inconstant power generation over the cycle, nega-
tively affecting the desalination performance. To improve the desali-
nation efficiency and energy recovery, Mehanna et al.
[162]
modified the MDC by imposing a small voltage while omitting oxy-
gen at the cathode, and called it as microbial electrodialysis cell
(MEDC) (Fig. 9b). The use of the MEDC process was investigated at a
set voltage of 0.55 V using two different initial NaCl concentrations
of 5 and 20 g L¡1. Conductivity in the desalination chamber was
reduced by up to 68 § 3% in a single fed-batch cycle, compared to
50 § 7(cid:1)60 § 7% in the MDC process [168]; the electrical energy effi-
ciencies in this new device reached 231 § 59%, with maximum H2
production rate of 0.16 § 0.05 m3 m¡3 d¡1. This approach better con-
trols the potentials between the electrodes, improving desalination
efficiency, and simultaneously induces hydrogen production to

Poffset the energy demand for desalination, making the process self-
sustaining. The crucial technical issues limiting MEDC are high inter-
nal resistance due to the installation of the middle chamber, anolyte
acidification and pH imbalances across the membranes, as observed
in MDC [93]. These pH imbalances can be in part attenuated by recir-
culating electrolyte between two chambers; also, this can promote
the recovery of protons for hydrogen production in cathode cham-
ber. Besides, Yang et al. [170] set up a direct pathway of proton
transfer between the anode and cathode chamber to force the migra-
tion of protons (Fig. 9c), which abated pH gradient by up to about
54% and meanwhile enhanced hydrogen production and salt
removal. Nonetheless, these strategies would complicate the config-
uration of MEDC and operation, which severely depresses the eco-
nomic viability.

PBased on MEDC, Kim and Logan [78] further proposed a microbial
saline-wastewater electrolysis cell (MSC) by exchanging the position
of AEM and CEM, i.e. placing a CEM next to the anode and an AEM
next to the cathode. Unlike MDC and MEDC, the solutions in anode
and cathode chambers are desalinated, while the water in middle
chamber gains salt ions and becomes concentrated. This allows for
wastewater treatment, salt removal and simultaneous H2 production
in a single process. The major challenge facing MSC, in addition to pH
gradient, is related to selection and enrichment of highly salt-toler-
ant exoelectrogenic microorganisms.

P3.4.3. Microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC)

PFor the normal MEC systems, the additional energy input should
be provided to overcome the thermodynamic barrier for the
cathodic bioelectrosynthesis, accomplishing H2 harvest. No method
can do this without an external voltage supply until microbial
reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC) appears. In 2011,
Kim and Logan [163] proposed a unique method for spontaneous H2
production by integrating a small reverse electrodialysis (RED) stack
into an MEC (i.e. MREC) (Fig. 9d). In this hybrid system, the energy
for driving H2 evolution comes from anodic oxidation of organic
matter by exoelectrogens and the salinity gradient between seawa-
ter and river water provided into the RED stack, thus completely
eliminating the need for the external power sources. The MREC
offers H2 production rate of 0.8 ¡ 1.6 m3 m¡3-anolyte d¡1 for seawa-
ter and river water flow rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mL min¡1, with

PH2 recovery efficiency of 72 ¡ 86%. By optimizing the number of RED
cell pairs and flow scheme, energy losses for pumping solutions
were minimized to »1%. The superiority of the coupled system is
zero-energy input; however, the major challenges for its real appli-
cations are high costs due to the use of several pairs of alternately
stacked anion and cation exchange membranes, and membrane foul-
ing caused by biofilm growth and the deposition of hardness-causing
cations. Besides, the need for both seawater and river water also
limits its applications to coastal areas.

PTo reduce the dependency upon seawater,

in a subsequent
study, Nam et al. [171] used thermolytic ammonium bicarbonate
(NH4HCO3) solutions instead of salt water to provide salinity-gradi-
ent energy source. The slat solution, which can be regenerated using
conventional distillation technologies and waste heat (»60 °C), pro-
duced sufficient voltage for H2 production with the maximum pro-
duction rate approaching 1.6 m3 m¡3 d¡1 and a H2 yield being
3.4 mol¡1-acetate at a salinity ratio of infinite. Likewise, Cusick et al.
[172] incorporated a RED stack with NH4HCO3 solutions in an ace-
tate-fed MFC for energy capture, and obtained the five times power
density (5.6 W m¡2-cathode) than that produced without the dialy-
sis stack. Following the same strategies, Luo et al. [53] examined the
feasibility of using a RED stack and a methanogenic biocathode for
methane production. At the imposed cathodic potential of ¡0.8 V vs.
Ag/AgCl, a maximum CH4 yield of 0.60 § 0.01 mol¡1-acetate was
obtained using the SS/Pt biocathode, with coulombic recovery of
75 § 2% and energy efficiency of 7.0 § 0.3%. The use of thermolytic
NH4HCO3 solutions in RED stacks enables energy capture from waste
biomass and low-grade waste heat [53]; the main limitation for this
approach is the crossover of negatively charged carbamate ions
¡) into the anodic chamber to balance the released protons,
(NH4CO3
which could contaminate anodolyte, and lead to the loss of salt solu-
tion [172]. Ammonia crossover can be minimized by through utiliz-
ing CEM as the last membrane on each side of the stack and feeding
low concentration solution into the channel nearest the anodic
chamber [172,173]. Besides, MREC has been further modified by Zhu
and co-workers for acid and alkali production [174], hydrogen
recovery and CO2 sequestration [175]; and authors referred to it as
microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis and chemical-produc-
tion cell (MRECC). Although MREC holds great potential for various
purposes, nonetheless, many works still should be done to improve
the working performance before considering the up-scale and prac-
tical use.

P3.4.4. Bio-photoelectrochemical cell (BPEC)

PA bio-photoelectrochemical cell (BPEC) can couple the photocata-
lytic/synthetic microorganisms as anodic or cathodic biocatalysts to
utilize inexhaustible solar energy for driving an electrochemical pro-
cess. The recent versions of BPEC include solar-powered microbial
fuel cell (SPMFC), photosynthetic microbial electrochemical cell
(PMEC), photosynthetic microbial desalination cell (PMDC), hybrid
photosynthetic biofuel cell (HPSBC), etc. The basic principles of dif-
ferent BPEC may differ with the individual purpose and reactor con-
figuration. For a SPMFC (Fig. 9e), as illustrated by Strik et al. [176],
four steps are involved: (i) production of chemical compounds by
photosynthetic organisms; (ii) transport of the chemical compounds
to the anodic chamber; (iii) anodic oxidation by electrochemically
active bacteria to release electrons; and (iv) deliver of electrons to
the cathode for oxygen reduction while producing electricity. The
SPMFC shares the same working principle with a conventional MFC,
except the in-situ biosynthesis of organic matter and supply. In this
system, photosynthetic organisms can also be cultivated on a cath-
ode as the oxygen supplier [164,177]. More details in the principles
and performance of SPMFC can be found in Strik et al. [176] and
Rosenbaum et al. [178]. Comparatively, a PMEC is constructed
to realize spontaneous electricity generation and concurrent H2
production under sunlight illumination [179]. In such a system,

Pphotosynthetic organisms (cyanobacteria) can directly capture sun-
light to split water, while the photo-excited electrons are conveyed
through external “bio-appendages” and transferred to the anode
via a porous silicon carbide (SiC) and carbon nanotube (CNT) layer.
The electrons are then combined with protons by heterotrophic
bacteria enriched biocathode to form H2. This concept has the
advantages of electricity output, wastewater treatment and simul-
taneous pure H2 harvest. However, it should be noted that the
research in PMEC presents high difficulty since it requires interdis-
ciplinary efforts with respect to biological, electrochemical, and
material sciences.

PPMDC is another emerging application of BPEC in treating waste-
water and saline water simultaneously. This system employs photo-
synthetic organisms (i.e. algae) mainly as a biocatalyst in the
biocathode [165,180,181], where algae consume CO2 and organic
matter present in wastewater under illumination to in-situ release
oxygen while growing algal biomass (Fig. 9f). The produced oxygen
serves as terminal electron accepter for electricity production, while
the value-added bio-products can be exploited for bioenergy pro-
duction. The environmental benefits of using such a system are
saline water desalination, wastewater treatment, as well as electric-
ity generation in a sole process. Moreover, CO2 fixation/capture and
valuable biomass production can be achieved at the same time. In
the similar way, Hern(cid:1)andez et al. [182] coupled the biocathodes of
microalgae Chlorella vulgaris to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa MFC for
glycerol biotransformation and CO2 capture. The combination not
only can improve power output, it can also produce value-added
chemical commodities, such as carbohydrates and lipids. In spite of
this, the process stability and the solar energy utilization and recov-
ery efficiency of these BPEC configurations remain to be promoted.
Efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction was also reported by using
perovskite-type sodium tantalate nanocubes (Vo-NaTaON) and
nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) grafted Vo-
NaTaON nanocubes, which was fabricated by spatial location engi-
neering of nitrogen and oxygen-vacancy [183]. The Vo-NaTaON crys-
tals with the simultaneous nitrogen and oxygen-vacancy effectively
regulated the electronic structure of sodium tantalite and endowed
the wide-bandgap perovskites tuning the band absorption region
from UV (315 nm) to visible regime beyond 600 nm, thereby exhibit-
ing superior broad spectrum photochemical reduction of CO2 to
fuels. Moreover, the N-GQDs/Vo-NaTaON hybrids could further effi-
ciently implement and enhance the multi-electron CO2 photoreduc-
tion to CO and CH4 due to the strong visible-light absorption and
suppressed radiative recombination of the photoexcited charge. Hsu
et al. [184] also synthesized a graphene oxides (GOs) based photoca-
talyst for enhancing photocatalytic CO2 conversion to methanol.
The photocatalytic activity on modified graphene oxide (GO-3) is
0.172 mmol g¡1-cat h¡1 under visible light, 6-fold higher than the
pure TiO2. For more details on photocatalysts for CO2 conversion, the
readers are referred to the recent review articles by Tu et al. [185],
Marszewski et al. [186], and Li et al. [187]. The possible configura-
tions of adsorbed CO2 on the photocatalyst surface and subsequent
photocatalytic conversion mechanism are illustrated in Fig. 11.
Development of photocatalysts opens up an avenue and new oppor-
tunities for the photoconversion of CO2 to renewable hydrocarbon
fuels, which simultaneously performs solar energy harvesting and
CO2 reduction.

P3.4.5. Microbial electrolysis cell-anaerobic digestion (MEC-AD) system

PMEC-AD system is a new type of bioelectrochemical system that
mostly relies upon the syntrophic interactions between exoelectro-
gens and fermentative partners. Fermenters can convert substrates
to metabolites accessible to electroactive microorganisms, making
the overall fermentation thermodynamically more favorable favor-
ing the electrons recovery [38,42,188]. Based on the favorable role
of the unique microbes, MEC has been coupled with anaerobic

Pat hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 4 d, increasing by 3.3 times
compared to the control (0.83 L L¡1 d¡1). Using a single-chamber
MEC fed with sewage sludge, Guo et al. [195] noticed 1.7(cid:1)5.2-
and 11.4(cid:1)13.6-fold increment in hydrogen and methane produc-
tion at the applied voltage of 1.4 and 1.8 V, respectively. Simi-
larly, Feng et al. [58] studied the influence of applied voltage on
the bioelectrochemical anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge at
ambient temperature (25 § 2 °C); voltage of 0.3(cid:1)0.5 V increased
methane production and VS removal, with Cloacamonas as the
dominant species. In a subsequent research, Zhen et al. [166]
constructed an MEC-AD system to treat aquatic plant Egeria
densa, and confirmed that the application of MEC effectively sta-
bilized Egeria densa fermentation and upgraded overall process
performance, especially solid matters removal. Egeria densa AD
process was operated steadily throughout bioelectrochemical
process without any signs of
imbalance with methane yield
improving to 248.2 § 21.0 mL L¡1 d¡1 at the voltage of 1.0 V. They
attributed the boosted performance to the syntrophic and win-
win interactions between fermenting bacteria and electrochemi-
cal active organisms (e.g. exoelectrogens on the anode and elec-
trotrophs on the cathode). Marone et al. [167] applied a similar
system with moderate halophilic consortium as biocatalysts
to treat recalcitrant table olive brine processing wastewater
(TOPW) and reported a maximum CH4 yield of 701 § 13 NmL L¡1-
TOPW with up to 80% of phenolic (i.e. hydroxytyrosol and tyro-
sol) removal at an anodic potential of +0.2 V vs. SCE. In contrast,
no methane was detected in the single anaerobic digester. They
further confirmed that the specific enrichment of resilient elec-
troactive microorganisms (i.e. genera Desulfuromonas and Geoal-
kalibacter) on the anode gave rise to the efficient TOPW
oxidation and biomethane generation. Except the enhancement
in biogas productivity, the combined system could also bioelec-
trochemically reduce VFAs present in anaerobic digestion efflu-
ent
the production of various bioalcohols (i.e. butanol,
ethanol, and propanol) [198]. Most recently, Cerrillo et al. [199]
coupled thermophilic AD of pig slurry to a MEC with a recircula-
tion loop to increase AD stability when submitted to organic and
nitrogen overloads. They pointed out that the MEC process was
able to improve the quality of the digestate during AD inhibition,
achieving a maximum COD and ammonium removal efficiency of
29% and 34%, respectively, and overall AD-MEC COD removal effi-
ciencies close to 60%. The combined process can help to increase
energy output and to polish the AD effluent, thereby attaining a
stable and robust system. Apparently, the combination of MEC
with AD would open a new perspective of versatile applications
of bioelectrochemical technologies.

Pdigestion system (MEC-AD) to upgrade H2 and/or CH4 production
(Fig. 12). To date, the combined system has been examined with a
diverse range of energy-rich substrates, such as waste activated
sludge [189], sludge fermentation liquid [190], aquatic plant Egeria
densa [166], garbage slurry [191], corn silage [192], cattle manure
[193], methanol wastewater [194], etc. The combination shows great
promise and many advantages for biomethane production when
compared to single anaerobic digestion. The early results have
indeed demonstrated the favorable roles of MEC-AD system in
enhancing the production of methane and system stability [36, 195],
and it even remediates AD system that exhibit process failure [196].
As an illustration, Sasaki et al. [197] configured a MEC-AD system
(named bioelectrochemical reactor, BER) containing carbon fiber
fabric (CFF) (BER+CFF) for methane fermentation of thickened
sewage sludge. Biogas production in BER+CFF was 3.57 L L¡1 d¡1

4. Fundamentals of electron transfer towards/from electrodes

4.1. Electron transfer towards anode

PThe transfer of electron between the outer membrane, redox-
active proteins, and the electrode surface is the functional basis
of all MEC systems tested thus far. Thereby, electron exchange
routes and efficiencies are the decisive factor influencing the
performance of an MEC platform. This electron exchange at bac-
terial-electrode interface comprises electron release towards
anode (oxidative) and electron uptake from cathode (reductive).
To date, several key pathways for extracellular electron transfer
(EET), including (i) direct electron transfer (DET) via membrane-
bound redox-enzymes or others like pili or pilus-like appendages
indirect electron transfer by using
(i.e. nanowires), and (ii)
redox-active organic electron shuttles
(including externally
added or self-secreted redox shuttles) in so-called “mediated
electron transfer (MET)”, have been hypothesized in the scientific
literature [7,11,49,200,201].

P4.1.1. Promoted electron transfer through exogenous redox mediators

PThe redox mediators, based on the producing sources, are classi-
fied into exogenous (artificial) and endogenous ones [11]. The artifi-
cial mediators (or electron shuttles) possesses the capability of
crossing the cell membranes, accepting electrons from electron car-
riers within the cells, and then transferring the electrons to the
solid-phase electrode [200] (Fig. 13a). They can be selectively oxi-
dized or reduced by special organisms without being consumed. For
a desirable exogenous mediator, it should have the following charac-
teristics: (i) electrochemically active; (ii) appropriate redox poten-
tial; (iii) easy to penetrate the cell membrane; (iv) no interference
with the metabolism of bacterial cells; (v) soluble and chemically
stable; and (vi) fast kinetics of reaction [202,203].

PTo date, a wide variety of artificial mediators have been exploited
in MFC studies to enhance electron transfer from inside the cells to

Pthe electrode surface and power generation. Common electron shut-
tles include natural red (E0 = (cid:1)0.325 V), thionin (E0 = 0.06 V), anthro-
quinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS, E0 = (cid:1)0.184 V), methyl viologen
(E0 = (cid:1)0.450 V), potassium ferricyanide (E0 = 0.361), methylene blue
(E0 = (cid:1)0.02 V), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (E0 = (cid:1)0.14 V), phe-
nothiazinone (E0 = 0.13), humic acid [7,45,201,204(cid:1)206], and others
such as bromocresol purple, cresol red, eosin, eriochrome black T,
methyl red, etc. [202]. These mediators can be added directly into
the anodolyte or be covalently linked onto the anode surface.
Another study by Adachi et al. [207] tried to immobilize the media-
tor 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfate on the anode using poly-
ethyleneimine as binder; however,
the poor conductivity of
polyethyleneimine to some extent limited the EET process. Recent
investigations have shown that the addition of electron shuttles
such as AQDS [208], methylene blue [204] and neutral red [209],
respectively, allowed 13-, 2.4-, and 1.7-time increase in maximum
power density. A main drawback of this approach is the necessity
of continual addition of artificial electron shuttles, which adds
expenses and attenuates its commercial applications in the real-
world scenarios.

P4.1.2. Promoted electron transfer through endogenous redox mediators
PMicroorganisms in some cases can themselves produce electron
shuttling compounds (i.e. endogenous mediators) via metabolism
pathways to aid in extracellular electron transfer. For example, a
typical strain capable of self-producing electron shuttles is Shewa-
nella oneidensis MR-1. An earlier work has revealed that the strain
could reduce ferric oxides without direct physical touch by secreting
electron shuttling-quinone, confirming the concept of self-mediated
electron transfer [210]. In a subsequent study, Marsili et al. [62]
observed the biosynthesis and secretion of riboflavin and riboflavin-
50-phosphate in biofilm reactors driven by Shewanella oneidensis
MR-1, with riboflavin representing the dominant component during
sustained incubations (>72 h). The similar result was documented
by Velasquez-Orta et al. [211], who detected flavins with flavin
mononucleotide (FMN) as the main component. Recent genetic anal-
ysis demonstrated that such cell-excreted redox molecules have a
high affinity for outer-membrane c-type cytochromes (OM c-Cyts)
with reduced hemes in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, which could
favor a one-electron redox reaction via semiquinone, enhancing the
EET rate by a 103- to 105-fold than that of free flavin [212]. Similar to
S. oneidensis MR-1, Geobacter sulfurreducens are proven to utilize
self-secreted riboflavin as a bound-cofactor in OM c-Cyts that con-
tributes to EET at the cell/electrode interface, highlighting the crucial
role of flavin redox cycling for efficient EET [213].

PSeveral evidences also indicate that Pseudomonas aeruginosa
release electrochemically active phenazine (pyocyanin and phena-
zine-1-carboxamide) as redox shuttles [214(cid:1)216]. The extracellular
redox active virulence factor pyocyanin binds directly to the deoxy-
ribose-phosphate backbone of DNA and intercalates with DNA
nitrogenous base pair regions, which causes local perturbations of
the DNA double helix structure and consequently enhances electron
transfer along the nucleic acid polymer [217]. Engineering Pseudo-
monas quinolone signal (PQS) biosynthesis pathway could further
improve the phenazine secretion and raise current density by sev-
eral folds [218]. More interestingly, the pyocyanin produced by
P. aeruginosa is sometimes accessible to other bacteria to carry out
extracellular electron transfer [214]. Besides, other organisms like
Sphingomonas xenophaga BN6 (4-amino-1,2-naphthoquinone and
[219], Geothrix fermentans
4-ethanolamino-1,2-naphthoquinone)
(as-yet-unidentified soluble compound) [220], Lactococcus lactis (2-
amino-3-dicarboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, ACNQ) [221], E. coli [222]
(Fig. 13b), and Klebsiella pneumoniae strain L17 (2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-
benzoquinon, 2,6-DTBBQ) [223] might also secrete redox shuttles.

PThe indirect electron transfer via self-produced redox shuttles
holds great promise considering independence of exogenous

loss;

furthermore,

the advantage of

Pmediators; moreover, a single shuttle molecule, in principle, could
cycle thousands of times. However, it should be noted that bio-
synthesis of an electron shuttle is energy-consuming, which causes
additional biological
this
approach gets weaken in open environments in which the anodic
medium is refreshed in continuous mode resulting in the rapid loss
of shuttles. For instance, in a Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 fuel cell,
removal of riboflavin reduced the rate of electron transfer by >70%
[62]; in a fuel cell inoculated with G. fermentans, similarly, one-time
replacement of the medium lowered power generation by 50%, and
it took another 10 days for the cell to recover to its original peak
level [220]. One solution for this issue is to recycle the redox shuttles
from the effluent, however, the task appears to be highly challeng-
ing. One other problem is the incomplete oxidation to substrate, as
claimed in a previous work conducted by Lanthier et al. [224], where
it was reported that S. oneidensis only incompletely oxidized its
fuel, lactate, leaving two-thirds of the electrons in unused waste
products. Further improvement is thus required for the commercial
considerations.

P4.1.3. Direct electron transfer (DET)

PDET could enable the electron exchange between microbial cells
and electrode interface, without the need for any diffusional redox
species (exogenous and endogenous redox shuttles) in the electro-
lyte. The well-studied electrochemically active organisms capable of
DET are dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria such as Geobacter,
Shewanella, and Rhodoferax spp [225,226]. Both outer membrane c-
type cytochromes (OM c-Cyts) and conductive nanowires or pili are
involved in DET process. Initial studies with the model representa-
tive Geobacter sulfurreducens noted that the DET via OM c-Cyts
requires the directly physical contact between the bacterial cell
membrane or a membrane organelle and anode surface, on the basis
of the virtual monolayer on the anode formed by cells [227]. The c-
Cyts comprise multihaem cytochromes such as ImcH and CbcL in the
cytoplasm [228], PpcA and related cytochromes in the periplasm
(PS) [200,229], and OmaB, OmaC, OmcB, OmcC, OmcE and OmcS in
the outer membrane (OM) [200,230,231], some of which, e.g. OmcE
and OmcS, mediate electron transfer reactions extracellularly of
G. sulfurreducens [230].

PIn several recent studies done by e.g. Reguera et al. [232,233],
Malvankar et al. [234], and Steidl et al. [235], it has been discovered
that G. sulfurreducens could also produce electrically conductive
pilus-like appendages called bacterial nanowires that are formed by
proteinaceous filaments anchored in the cell envelop. The pili, being
20 mm or so in length [233], are highly conductive with electronic
conductivities of »5 mS cm(cid:1)1 [234]. These materials can conduct
over long distance, allowing organisms to respire and transfer elec-
trons to external solid-phase accepters such as oxide minerals in the
environment and electrodes in fuel cells, without the need for inti-
mate touch or the use of dissolved electron shuttles. Further genetic
analysis evidences that PilA gene is essential to the formation and
assembly of pili in G. sulfurreducens, and deletion of PilA causes the
loss of the ability to evolve electrochemically conductive pili [232].
Despite that pili are not very indispensable for electron transfer to
anode, the presence of conductive pili enables long-range electrical
transfer in an energy-efficient manner, increasing electricity produc-
tion more than 10-fold in a G. sulfurreducens fuel cell [233]. Because
of the unique characteristics, G. sulfurreducens are capable of
completely oxidizing acetate to CO2, with electron recovery up to

PSimilar observation was also documented in Shewanella oneiden-
sis MR-1 [237,238] that, apart from the ability to self-produce redox
shuttles as aforesaid, could evolve electrically conductive nanowires
(50(cid:1)150 nm in diameter, (cid:5)10 nm in height, and tens of microns in
length) [239] (Fig. 13c and d). Shewanella nanowires are extensions

Pmultiheme cytochromes MtrC and OmcA localize to these mem-
brane extensions, allowing long-range electron transport along a
membrane network of heme cofactors that line the nanowires [238].
Not exclusive to Geobacter and Shewanella species, some organisms
like oxygenic phototrophic cyanobacterium (Synechocystis PCC6803)
and the thermophilic, fermentative bacterium (Pelotomaculum ther-
mopropionicum) do the same, revealing that the microbial behavior
may represent a common strategy for efficient electron transfer and
energy distribution [239].

PAnother dissimilatory metal-reducing organism capable of DET is
Rhodoferax ferrireducens; more importantly, unlike Geobacter or
Shewanella species, Rhodoferax strains show a potential to directly
and completely oxidize complex substrates such as glucose to CO2
while yielding 24 electrons (C6H12O6 + 6H2O ! 6CO2 + 24H+ + 24e(cid:1))
[66,240]. This, of course, will substantially improve electron recov-
ery and conversion efficiency of glucose to renewable energy, e.g.
electricity or H2. In contrast to 0.04% of electron recovery for Clostrid-
ium butyricum [241], for example, R. ferrireducens converted over
80% of the glucose electrons to current [66]. However, whether or
not Rhodoferax species are also capable of evolving conductive nano-
wires remains to be investigated. Other organisms believed to
directly transfer electrons to the anode include strains of Geobacter
metallireducens [242], Geoalkalibacter subterraneus [243], Shewanella
putrefaciens [244,245], Thermincola potens JR [246], Aeromonas
hydrophila [247], Hansenula anomala [248], and Shewanella loihica
PV-4 [249] (Table 3).

4.2. Electron uptake from cathode

PAs found for anodic EET, transfer of electrons from cathode to
microbes (i.e. electrotrophs) can occur either directly or indirectly

Pby means of electron shuttles [7,13,49] (Fig. 14 and Table 3); of
course, the potential mechanisms may differ [96] because of oppo-
site electron transfer direction.

P4.2.1. Direct electron transfer (DET)

PThe first and, perhaps, most ideal and efficient channel for
cathodic EET, similar to anode systems, is through DET (Fig. 14i). The
first evidence to support the capability of microorganisms to directly
accept electrons from electrode was provided by Gregory et al. [250]
in reducing nitrate to nitrite using Geobacter metallireducens or
fumarate to succinate by Geobacter sulfurreducens. Direct transfer
was assumed to happen on the basis of: (i) direct contact of cells
with electrode, (ii) slow hydrogen evolution rate at the posied
potential (10,000 less than the rates of nitrate and fumarate reduc-
tion), (iii) fact that G. metallireducens cannot use hydrogen as elec-
tron donor due to the lack of hydrogenase, and (iv) the same
performance of G. sulfurreducens in fumarate reduction irrespective
of the genes for hydrogenase. In a subsequent study by Nevin et al.
[96], a wide diversity of microrganisms, including acetogen Sporo-
musa ovata and other acetogenic bacteria such as Sporomusa sphaer-
oides, Clostridium ljungdahlii, Clostridium aceticum, and Moorella
thermoacetica were demonstrated to be able to take up electrons
directly from cathode with concomitant production of acetate, for-
mate and 2-oxobutyrate from CO2. The analogous outcome might be
occurring throughout the electro-reduction of CO2 to acetate by Ace-
tobacterium wieringae [15]. Cheng et al. [4] also presumed that Meth-
anobacterium palustre could reduce CO2 to methane via DET without
need for hydrogen evolution, highly compared to the findings of
Zhen et al. [48] and Siegert et al. [251]. Besides, DET has been previ-
ously cited as the core mechanism in reductive dechlorination of
pentachlorophenol (PCP) with cathodic electroactive organisms of

Fig. 14. Possible electron transfer mechanisms for the electro-reduction of CO2 to electrofuels and value-added commodities: (i) Methane, acetate production via DET. (ii) H2 as
the electron-carrier to deliver electrons to Sporomusa ovata for acetate, methane formation. (iii) Electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce formate, which is then bioconverted to
higher alcohols by the engineered Ralstonia eutropha. (iv) Hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases secreted by M. maripaludis, when adsorbed onto electrode surface, catalyze
the formation of H2 and formate while transporting electrons to M. maripaludis for methane production with concomitant carbon fixation. (v) Indirect electron transfer via exoge-
nous mediators.

PProteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [252], and electrofer-
mentation of glucose and glycerol using Clostridium pasteurianum
DSM 525 as the biocatalyst [253]. However, the major challenge in
this process is that, unlike anodic EET, the key compounds governing
cathodic DET are still not clear enough. Ross et al. [254] examined
electron flow from electrodes into S. oneidensis MR-1 to determine
the molecular components of reductive electron flow, and what
driving forces are required. They observed that multiheme c-type
cytochromes MtrA, MtrB, CymA, menC and FccA played crucial roles
in fumarate reduction and electron uptake, and that deletion of
MtrA, MtrB, CymA, and menC eliminated >85% of electron flux while
lacking FccA disabled S. oneidensis from accepting electrons. Several
lines of recent works also imply that some microbial enzymes or
molecules such as membrane-bound Rnf complexes, Rubredoxin,
etc. [26,255] may be involved in DET and energy conservation, but
need to verify. Further, it has been also suggested that the cyto-
chrome PccH may induce DET from electrode to G. sulfurreducens
cells in fumarate reduction [256], and hydrogenases of sulfate-
reducing bacteria (SRB) in the reduction of acetic and butyric acids
to alcohols and acetone [257]. Besides, the mechanisms of DET via c-
type cytochromes, multicopper proteins, or extracellular appendage
(pili or flagella)-like structures in model organisms (e.g. Desulfovibrio
spp.) were also suggested for electrohydrogenesis [70]. Rozendal
et al. [135] presented the first proof-of-concept study regarding
mediatorless hydrogen gas production with biocathde that was
based on a naturally selected mixed culture of electrochemically
active microorganisms. A previous work of Aulenta et al. [258]
observed the capability of Desulfovibrio paquesii in DET and hydrogen
production with the coulombic efficiency being roughly 100%. Vil-
lano et al. [259] stated that Desulfitobacterium-enriched culture was
capable of catalyzing hydrogen evolution without the use of redox
mediator at cathode potentials lower than (cid:1)700 mV vs. SHE, sup-
porting the current understanding of DET involved in hydrogen pro-
duction. Nonetheless, at the present stage, the electron transfer

Ptaking place in biocathode systems is still poorly understood, and
future investigation of the precise DET mechanisms should be a high
research priority.

PAlternatively, the cathodic EET can be accomplished through H2
(Fig. 14ii). In this mechanism, hydrogen gas is produced at the cath-
ode either electrochemically or biologically and serves as an elec-
tron-carrier to deliver electrons. Usually, indirect EET via H2 is not
energy-efficient
cathode potential
requires
(Ecat = (cid:1)0.414 V vs. NHE) than via DET, e.g. Ecat = (cid:1)0.244 V vs. NHE for
direct electromethanogenesis. Moreover, H2 has the low solubility in
water (around 4.29 £ 10(cid:1)7 mmol L(cid:1)1), which negatively affects elec-
tron exchange rate and efficiency. In addition, the safety issues
(explosive) associated with H2 brings about inherent constraints to
this option towards commercialization. In this light, intermediate
production of H2 should be suppressed and even eliminated, for
example routinely by controlling cathode potentials [252]. However,
this scenario has much difficulty to achieve in reality. The role and
significance of H2 in the bioelectrosynthesis of multi-carbon electro-
fuels and commodities seem have been the subject of scientific
debate. For instance, in sharp contrast to DET theory supported by
Cheng et al. [4], Lohner et al. [260] and Zhen et al. [48] for methane
production, Villano and colleagues [50] confirmed the favorable con-
tribution of abiotic H2 to overall methane formation in an MEC incu-
bated with hydrogenophilic methaneogens. They inferred that the
observed methane production could have been sustained via inter-
species hydrogen transfer between electroactive H2-producing
organisms and H2-utilizing methanogens. Likewise, H2/formate-
driven methane formation was achieved using Fe(0)-corroding and
electromethanogenic archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis [261].
These experiments indicated that M. maripaludis release hydroge-
(formate dehydrogenases), and these enzymes, when
nases
adsorbed onto appropriate redox-active sites of electrode surface,

Pcatalyze the formation of H2 and formate, which are subsequently
utilized by M. maripaludis to produce methane with CO2 fixation
(Fig. 14iii and iv). Also, one of the recent studies highlighted the
importance of hydrogen route in the electromicrobial conversion of
CO2 to acetate in a Sporomusa ovata-MEC system, where acetate pro-
duction of 244 § 20 mg L(cid:1)1 was detected only at a potential ((cid:1)0.66 V
vs. SHE) enabling hydrogen evolution [17]. Furthermore, H2-driven
pathway for acetate has been introduced into Acetoanaerobium
[148]; the strain, through rapidly consuming high biologically
induced H2 flux within the biofilm, drives high rate/high efficiency
bioelectrosynthesis of acetate from carbon dioxide (electron recov-
ery up to 99 § 1%). Except for H2, other alternative electron-carriers
include formic acid [13,14] (Fig. 14iii), acetate [68], etc., which are
highly soluble without safety issues and could be further used for
the production of high-value chemical commodities, such as long-
chain fatty acids or higher alcohols (e.g. isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-
butanol).

P4.2.3. Indirect electron transfer through redox mediators

PThe third method for cathodic EET is mediated electron transfer
(Fig. 14v). The routinely used artificial electron shuttles are Everitt's
salt (K2FeII[FeII(CN)6]) [262], iron citrate [263], neutral red [264],
methyl viologen [265], as well as solid-phase humin [158] and bio-
char [266]. Later, using oxidoreductase enzymes (formate, aldehyde,
and alcohol dehydrogenase), reduction of CO2 to methanol and for-
mate was achieved successively [264,267]. Lojou et al. [268] investi-
gated the production and consumption of hydrogen by Desulfovibrio
desulfuricans and they found that the addition of methyl viologen
stimulated current generation. On the other hand, Shewanella onei-
densis MR-1, apart from via DET, under aerated conditions in the
presence of lactate could also produce exogenous riboflavin to medi-
ate electron uptake and Cr(VI) reduction [154]. Overall, the supple-
mentation of artificial redox mediators could be one of the attractive
options in accelerating electron transfer and electrofuels production.
However, how to design the cost-efficient electron shuttles and
virtually use them for real-world applications remain a major
challenge.

5. Concluding remarks and future perspectives

PThe energy shortage and environmental deterioration are becom-
ing the worsening global issues and the huge barrier for the develop-
ment of human society. The MEC platform holds the great potentials
for future waste biorefinery, pollutants removal, CO2 capture and
recycling, and bioelectrosynthesis of green and renewable electro-
fuels or industrially useful chemicals, dealing with the depletion of
carbon-based fossil fuels and global warming issues. Moreover, this
process allows natural energy, such as solar, etc., to be harvested
and stored for use, making it potentially environmentally sustain-
able and flexible. The intensive efforts currently devoted to the
design and optimization of new-generation bioelectrochemical cells
further expand the scope of applications and promote the develop-
ment of MEC technique. In the view of this, this option can be one of
potential alternatives to the conventional waste biorefinery pro-
cesses. Nonetheless, despite the distinct advantages and promising
perspectives above highlighted, MEC, at the present stage, is still in
its infancy and far from practical applications. Numerous challenges
ahead for MEC need to be tackled before considering its up-scaling
and real implementations.

PThe start-up is the key-step for an MEC to realize efficient and
stable electrofuels production from wastes. Although several strate-
gies have been suggested in the literature, offering good experiences
and lessons for accelerating MEC start-up, it still takes a couple of
weeks to months to start up which limits industrial-scale applica-
tions. Moreover, most of previous studies are conducted with model
electroactive culture and pure substrates, rather than real wastes.

PReal wastes have complex physiochemical properties and change-
able compositions, as a result of which, whether the lessons learned
can be adopted directly in real-world waste treatment remains to be
verified. Electrode materials and cathodic catalysts are another two
critical issues associated with scaling-up [3]. Carbon-based materials
(graphite fiber brush, carbon cloth, etc.) are by far the most fre-
quently used type of electrodes owing to good biocompatibility and
low costs. The main problems are high overpotentials and large
ohmic/voltage loss, and electrode corrosion/deterioration may hap-
pen if the cathodic potential imposed is too negative. Thus, the
development of new, durable and low-cost electrode materials, with
high activity, conductivity and stability, is a primary task to ensure
reliable electrochemical output. To lower overpotentials needed and
thermodynamic barrier, catalysts, in particular noble metal platinum
(Pt), are always applied in MEC, which leads to faster dynamics, effi-
cient proton and electron combination, and high electrosynthesis
efficiency. But it should be admitted that Pt is not the best choice
from economic, environmental and full-scale application points of
view, because of high cost, short lifetime and ease of deactivation.
To create more efficient, robust and sustainable cathodic catalysts,
the extensive efforts are required to fabricate new nano-catalysts
and catalyst assemblies [10] with high catalytic activity, durability
and selectivity. Today's advances in the basic sciences of nano-sci-
ence, electrochemistry, photochemistry and biochemistry represent
a great opportunity for multifunctional catalysts development [23].

PBiocathode using electroactive microorganisms as biocatalysts
holds great attractiveness over the conventional metal catalysts and
gains ever-growing attentions. However, the enrichment and prolif-
eration of biofilm is a long and difficult business (i.e. start-up); effi-
cient and simple procedures to boost the formation of biofilm are
urgently required. Also, the catalytic activity of biofilm differs
greatly with electrode materials, inoculum sources, substrate com-
positions and operational conditions, which cause a huge barrier for
field-scale use of MEC. Meanwhile, though the previous studies have
been mainly carried out in bench-cycle and small scale varying from
a few milliliters to several
liters at most [272]; however, few
attempts have elucidated the performance of biocathode in large-
scale operation and the results are far unsatisfactory [141,273].
Escapa et al. [273] run a 6.6 L modular pilot-scale MEC with Ni-based
gas diffusion cathode (Ni load of »0.4 mg cm¡2) to treat domestic
wastewater for around 60 days. COD removal efficiencies fell below
10% during the long-term operational phase with relatively high
energy consumption compared to up to 92% at batch tests. Thus, spe-
cial care should be taken to ensure the high effectiveness and contin-
uous catalytic activity of biocathode at full scale. All of these factors
have discounted the repeatability and reliability of MEC platform,
which accordingly restricts the commercial implementation and
even up-scaling of this system. Thus, how to virtually use the MEC
for real-world application remains a huge technical difficulty. Addi-
tionally, as the “heart” of MEC, the electrochemical behaviors of bio-
cathode directly affect the electron transfer rate and electrofuels
production efficiency. Mapping the electrocatalytic activities of bio-
film, and developing effective solutions enhancing direct electron
transport efficiency between electroactive organisms and cathode
surface should be the subject of exciting research in the years to
come. Further work is also needed to understand microbial commu-
nity dynamics as well as syntrophic interactions between ferment-
ing bacteria and electroactive microbes. These developments will
surely enhance the MEC's industrial competitiveness and facilitate
progress toward commercialization, eventually supporting the reali-
zation of the energy-sustainable and carbon-less society.
