Energy from biomass, bioenergy, is a promising source to replace fossil fuels in the future, as it is
abundant, clean, and carbon dioxide neutral. Thermochemical liquefaction of biomass is widely inves-
tigated as a promising method to produce one kind of liquid biofuel, namely bio-oil. This review presents
the recent research progress in the liquefaction of typical biomass from a new perspective. Particularly,
this article summarizes five aspects of related work: first, the effect of solvent type on the liquefaction
behaviors of biomass; second, the effect of biomass type on the liquefaction behaviors of biomass; third,
the liquefaction of biomass in sub-/super-critical ethanol; fourth, the liquefaction of biomass in organic
solventewater mixed solvents; fifth, the liquefaction of sewage sludge. Meanwhile, the research advance
in the migration and transformation behavior of heavy metals during the liquefaction of sewage sludge
was also summarized in this review. This review can offer an important reference for the study of
biomass liquefaction.

1. Introduction

It is believed that the climate change is currently the most
pressing global environmental problem. Hundreds of millions of
people could lose their lives and up to one million species could
become extinct if the average global temperature increases by more
than 2 (cid:2)C. It is widely accepted that using fossil fuels has caused
global warming [1,2]. On the other hand, the world has been con-
fronted with an energy crisis due to the depletion of finite resources
of fossil fuels [3]. Global energy crisis and environmental pollution,
derived from the massive use of conventional fossil fuels, have led
to a move towards alternative, renewable, sustainable, efficient and
cost-effective energy sources with less emission. Some of the most
notable alternative sources of energy capable of replacing fossil
fuels include: water, solar and wind energy, and biofuels [4].

Biofuels are generated from renewable resources such as agri-
cultural crops, woody and herbaceous biomass, and waste mate-
rials, which are renewable annually or in several years [5]. Biofuels
are broadly classified as primary and secondary biofuels. The pri-
mary biofuels are used in an unprocessed form, primarily for
heating, cooking or electricity production such as fuelwood, wood
chips and pellets, etc. The secondary biofuels are produced by
processing of biomass, e.g. ethanol, biodiesel, dimethyl ether
(DME), etc. [6]. Biomass can be converted to biofuels via two main
types of processes: thermo-chemical and bio-chemical/biological
processes [7]. Generally, thermo-chemical processes have higher
efficiency than bio-chemical/biological processes in terms of the
shorter reaction time required (a few seconds or minutes for
thermo-chemical processes vs. several days, weeks or even longer
for bio-chemical/biological processes) and the superior ability to
degrade most of the organic compounds [8].

Thermochemical conversion processes mainly include com-
bustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and liquefaction [8e11]. Liquefac-
tion is a low-temperature (250e400 (cid:2)C) and high-pressure
(5e20 MPa) thermochemical process during which the biomass is
converted into three products, i.e. a bio-oil fraction (target product),
a gas fraction and a solid residue fraction, in water or another
suitable solvent [12e14]. As depicted in Fig. 1, the basic reaction
pathways for the liquefaction of biomass can be described as: (i)
depolymerization of the biomass into biomass monomers; (ii)
decomposition of biomass monomers by cleavage, dehydration,
decarboxylization and deamination, forming light fragments of
small molecules, which are unstable and active; (iii) rearrangement
of light fragments through condensation, cyclization and poly-
merization, leading to new compounds [8,15e17].

In recent years, there has been a continuing increase in the
number of research work concerning the liquefaction of biomass.
And some related review papers focusing on the advances in
biomass liquefaction have also been published. The liquefaction of
biomass in water has been extensively reviewed by Peterson et al.
[13], Toor et al. [15], Tekin et al. [18], Kang et al. [19] and Toor et al.
[20]. The effect of process parameters on the liquefaction of
biomass has been widely reviewed by Akhtar and Admin [21] and
Behrendt et al. [22]. Pan [23] reviewed the synthesis of resin
products from the liquefaction biomass in organic solvents. The
hydrothermal catalytic liquefaction of biomass is detailedly sum-
marized by Yeh et al. [24] and Tekin and Karag€oz [25]. Pavlovi(cid:2)c et al.
[26], Ruiz et al. [27] and Knez et al. [28] introduced the hydro-
thermal liquefaction of agricultural and food processing wastes,
agriculture residues and marine biomass, organic wastes and
byproducts, respectively. Elliott et al. [29] described the recent re-
sults in hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass in continuous-flow
processing systems. Xu et al. [30] discussed the liquefaction of
biomass in hot-compressed water, alcohols and alcoholewater co-
solvents.

Although the liquefaction of biomass has been widely studied in
these investigations cannot be directly
various conditions,
compared due to the difference in the separation of products and
definition of the liquid product (bio-oil). To understand the effect of
solvent/biomass type on the liquefaction behaviors, all the lique-
faction experiments must be carried out at identical conditions
[31,32]. Therefore, researchers specially designed and carried out
many liquefaction studies to discuss the effect of solvent/biomass
types on the liquefaction behaviors of biomass. To the best of our
knowledge, there is no related review literature published, focusing
on discussing and analyzing above work. Meanwhile, the lique-
faction of biomass in ethanol has not been systematically summa-
rized in related review literature, too. Although the liquefaction of
biomass in alcohol-water co-solvents has been introduced in an
edited book [30], the information is limited. As respects to the
liquefaction of sewage sludge, there are few related reviews.

The aim of this review is to summarize the above mentioned
work in the hope of providing some new information for the
liquefaction of biomass. Specifically, this review mainly focuses on
five aspects of related work. We firstly covers those work devoted
to investigating the liquefaction behaviors of one biomass in
different solvents at identical conditions in Section 4.1. Next, Sec-
tion 4.2 describes the work devoted to studying the liquefaction
behaviors of different biomasses at identical conditions. Section 4.3
and Section 4.4 focus on the application of sub-/super-critical

ethanol in biomass liquefaction and the liquefaction of biomass in
organic solventewater mixed solvents, respectively. Finally, the
liquefaction of sewage sludge is summarized in Section 4.5.
Meanwhile, the migration and transformation behaviors of heavy
metals during the liquefaction of sewage sludge are also discussed
in Section 4.5.

2. Biomass classification

Biomass includes plantation that produces energy crops, natural
vegetable growth and organic wastes and residues. It can be usually
grouped as: (i) agricultural & forestry residues: silviculture crops;
(ii) herbaceous crops: weeds, Napier grass; (iii) aquatic and marine
biomass: algae, water hyacinth, aquatic weeds, plants, sea grass
beds, kelp and coral reef, etc.; (iv) wastes: municipal solid waste,
municipal sewage sludge, animal waste and industrial waste, etc.
[9]. Biomass is a broad definition and includes a wide range of
materials with varying compositions. The representative compo-
nents of various biomass feedstocks include carbohydrates, lignin,
protein and lipids [13,15].

According to the differences in the compositions and structures
of biomass, the common/typical biomass can be divided into three
categories,
including lignocellulosic biomass, microalgae and
organic waste, shown in Fig. 2. Lignocellulosic biomass materials
are the most widely used type of biomass for bio-oil production
through liquefaction [8]. The main components of lignocellulosic
biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin [5]. Microalgal
biomass has been recognized as attractive feedstock for the third-
generation biofuel
[33]. Microalgae, a ubiquitous eukaryotic
microorganism, can be rich in proteins or lipids or have a balanced
composition of lipids, sugars and proteins [34,35]. Organic waste
generally refers to those materials consisting of bacterial constit-
uents (nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) and their
decay products,
incompletely degraded organic substance and
inorganic substance e sewage sludge and animal manure, for
example. Obviously, there are significant differences in the com-
positions and structures of above three types of biomasses.

3. Liquefaction solvent

The key difference between the liquefaction technology and
other three thermochemical conversion processes (combustion,
pyrolysis and gasification) is that water or other suitable solvents
must be adopted as the reaction medium during the liquefaction
process. Liquefaction of biomass with proper solvents is a process

that can prospectively be integrated with optimized conditions to
produce fuel additives and valuable chemicals, simultaneously [31].
Solvents, according to their polarity, can be classified into three
categories: polar protic, dipolar aprotic and non-polar solvents.
Polar protic solvents such as water and alcohols refer to compound
with a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom like
oxygen. Dipolar aprotic solvents such as acetone and 1,4-dioxane
describe a molecule that does not contain an OeH bond. All sol-
vents in this class contain a bond with a large bond dipole, which is
a multiple bond between carbon and either oxygen or nitrogen.
Non-polar solvents are compounds that have low dielectric con-
stants and are not miscible with water (e.g., benzene and diethyl
ether) [36].

The properties of common liquefaction solvents (water, meth-
anol, ethanol, etc.) and their critical constants are given in Table 1
[36]. The type of solvents can also be generally divided into two
classes, water and organic solvents. Fig. 3 shows the advantages and
disadvantages of water and organic solvents as liquefaction solvent.
Water is the most widely used liquefaction solvent. Not only is
water environmental benign solvent, cheap, not polluting the
environment, but also it facilitates the recovery and recycling of the
inorganic matters contained in biomass in their ionic form, for
eventual use as fertilizers. More importantly, employing water as a
reactant and as the reaction medium in a biomass conversion
process will eliminate the costly drying process of wet feedstocks,
which makes it a promising reaction medium for biomass lique-
faction [13,15]. However, biomass liquefaction in water is accom-
panied with many shortcomings, such as challenging operating
conditions, low yield of water-insoluble bio-oil and low-heating
values of the resulting bio-oil [37,38].

To enhance the water-insoluble bio-oil yield with lower oxy-
gen content, organic solvents, such as ethanol, methanol, acetone,
etc., have been utilized as the reaction medium instead of water
[31,33,39,40]. The presence of organic solvents, whose critical
points are much lower than that of water, could succeed in con-
verting biomass into bio-oils under mild reaction conditions.
However, the use of the organic solvent could also yield some
problems, for example, a high cost of the solvent should be
considered; the application and recycling of a large quantity of
organic solvent (such as methanol and phenol) may result in
some environmental concerns [19]. In addition, adopting pure
organic solvent as the liquefaction solvent usually requires the
drying treatment of the biomass feedstock, which may increase
the energy input. The recycling of
inorganic matters is also
difficult [41].

4. Recent research work on the liquefaction of typical
biomass

4.1. The effect of liquefaction solvent type

In a biomass liquefaction process, the presence of solvent pro-
motes such reactions as solvolysis, hydration, and pyrolysis, which
helps achieving better fragmentation of biomass and enhancing
dissolution of reaction intermediates. The type of solvents is thus
one of the key parameters that determine the yield and composi-
tion of the bio-oil [30]. The effect of liquefaction solvent type on the
liquefaction behaviors of various biomasses, including lignocellu-
loses, algae and sewage sludge, has been widely studied by many
researchers around the world, as elaborated in Table 2.

4.1.1. Lignocelluloses

Different researchers give different results on the effect of sol-
vent type on the liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass. On the
whole, three solvents, acetone, phenol, and 1,4-dioxane, are found
to be more effective in the liquefaction of lignocelluloses. In addi-
tion, the liquefaction of lignocelluloses in high-polarity or high-
hydrogenation ability solvents will also have higher efficiency.

Küçük et al. [42,43] performed the liquefaction of Prangmites
australis in methanol and ethanol and the liquefaction of Verbascum
stalk in methanol, ethanol and acetone. Experiment results
revealed that ethanol gave higher bio-oil yield than methanol in the
liquefaction of P. australis. The yields of bio-oil from the liquefaction
of V. stalk were ranked in the following order: acetone >

methanol > ethanol. Aysu et al. [44e46] investigated the lique-
faction of three common plants, Typha latifolia, giant fennel (Ferula
orientalis L.) and Onopordum heteracanthum, in different organic
solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, acetone and 2-
butanol. A same result was obtained that the most effective lique-
faction solvent was acetone. The high-effectiveness of acetone can
be explained by the fact that the lignin and acetone contain similar
functional group (carbonyl groups), which confirms the “similar
dissolves similar” rule.

Phenol was certified to be the optimal solvent for liquefying
bamboo. The conversion rate reached up to 99% [47]. The inter-
mediate product of lignocellulose liquefaction contains a substan-
tial amount of phenol derivatives. These intermediates have a
similar polarity to phenol, which can be dissolved efficiently and
thus give a higher conversion rate. Mazaheri et al. [36] carried out
the liquefaction of oil palm fruit pressed fiber (FPF) in methanol,
ethanol, acetone, and 1,4-dioxane, respectively. Among these sol-
vents, subcritical 1,4-dioxane treatment was found to be more
effective in the degradation of FPF to produce bio-oil component,
which was ascribed to the fact that 1,4-dioxane molecules have one
oxygen atom more than that of other solvents.

Polar protic solvents were certified to be more suitable than
dipolar aprotic and non-polar solvents in the liquefaction of oil
palm empty fruit bunch fiber [48] and sawdust [31,49,50]. Fan et al.
[48] implemented the liquefaction of oil palm empty fruit bunch
fiber in polar protic solvents (ethylene glycol (EG), water and
ethanol), dipolar aprotic solvent (acetone) and non-polar solvent
(toluene), respectively. Polar protic solvents gave higher conversion
rates and bio-oil þ gas yields. EG was certified to be the best solvent
due to its high dipole moment. As for the liquefaction of sawdust,
the highest bio-oil yields were usually obtained in methanol or
ethanol [31,49,50]. Free radical reaction and the ionic reactions
including nucleophilic, electrophilic and elimination reactions
occurred in the liquefaction process. These reactions mostly are
relevant to the polarity of the reaction system. Therefore, higher
conversion rate and bio-oil yield were usually achieved in the sol-
vents with higher polarity.

The effect of the hydrogenation ability of solvent on the lique-
faction behaviors of
lignocellulose was also reported [51,52].
Hydrogen donor solvents could present higher liquefaction effi-
ciency. Wang et al. [51] studied the liquefaction of sawdust in

Fig. 3. The advantages and disadvantages of water and organic solvents as liquefaction solvent.

hydrogen donor solvent (tetralin) and non-hydrogen donor solvent
(toluene) or without the presence of solvent. The highest conver-
sion rate and bio-oil yield were obtained with tetralin as solvent.
Murnieks et al. [52] researched the liquefaction of wheat straw in

the presence of ethanol and toluene. When ethanol was adopted as
liquefaction solvent, higher yield of bio-oil can be obtained. The
presence of solvent, especially the hydrogen donor one, favors the
molecular rearrangement and stabilization of free radicals by

hydrogen donor, and hydrocracking of heavier molecules to light
ones due to its penetration and hydrogen-supply abilities.

There is a definite relation between the length of the alcohol
alkyl chain and the liquefaction behaviors of lignocellulose. Fig. 4
shows the effect of the length of the alcohol alkyl chain on the
liquefaction behaviors of Japanese beech (Faguscrenata Blume) [39].
At 270 (cid:2)C (Fig. 4(a)), the conversion rate of beech wood decreased
slightly with the increasing length of the alcohol alkyl chain for
shorter reaction times of less than 10 min. In contrast, the con-
version rate rose with the increasing length of the alcohol alkyl
chain for prolonged reaction times over 10 min. At 350 (cid:2)C
(Fig. 4(b)), however, it was apparent that alcohols with longer alkyl
chains exhibited faster wood liquefaction. Thus 1-octanol was
suggested for wood liquefaction. The liquefaction rate constants (k,
Fig. 4(c)) of wood components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin)
were also found to be related to the length of the alkyl chain of the
alcohol. Alcohols with longer alkyl chains can dissolve higher mo-
lecular weight products, which cannot be liquefied in alcohols with
shorter alkyl chains. Thus a faster biomass conversion to liquefac-
tion products can be obtained in alcohols with longer alkyl chains.
The type of liquefaction solvents also has a significant influence
on the compositions of bio-oils. Ethanol favored the decomposition
of wheat straw to short-chain alcohols. In the presence of toluene,
more cyclic compounds were obtained [52]. In the liquefaction of
oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber, water, ethanol and toluene yielded
major phenolic compounds, while EG favored the formation of
alcohol compounds and acetone yielded ketone and aldehyde
compounds [48]. It was confirmed that acetone can promote the
generation of ketones while ethanol favored the production of
phenolic derivates in the liquefaction of pinewood sawdust [49].

The liquefaction mechanisms of biomass in different solvents
may primarily determine the distinct liquefaction behaviors. The
liquefaction mechanisms of biomass in water and ethanol are
shown in Fig. 5 [14]. Similar to the fast pyrolysis, hydrothermal
liquefaction consists of beneficial primary reactions (pyrolytic &
hydrolytic degradation) and non-beneficial secondary reactions i.e.,
recombination and secondary cracking. In ethanol, biomass was
decomposed by pyrolysis and alcoholysis at relatively high reaction
temperatures while the recombination of reaction intermediates
are retarded by the unique reactions of ethanol such as hydrogen
donation and hydroxylalkylation. Therefore, it is easy to under-
stand this phenomenon that the heating rate was a crucial
parameter in the liquefaction of pine sawdust with sub-critical
water as solvent, whereas it has marginal influence in the super-
critical ethanol-based liquefaction [14].

4.1.2. Algae

The effects of solvent type on the liquefaction behaviors of algal
biomass can be summarized as follows: (i) higher conversion rate
was usually achieved in strong polarity solvent; (ii) the bio-oil yield
showed no clear trend with the polarity of the solvent. Almost
certainly, higher bio-oil yield was always achieved in those solvents
with strong polarity; (iii) ethanol was considered to be the most
suitable solvent. Duan et al. [53] conducted the liquefaction of
Chlorella pyrenoidosa in eleven potential solvents with a wide range
of polarity (Fig. 6). Water as the most polar one gave the lowest
solid residue yield (5.6%). Benzene was the most non-polar solvent
and only 65.1% of conversion rate was achieved. Higher bio-oil yield
was achieved in those solvents with strong polarity such as
ethylene glycol, ethanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate. Ethanol was
thought to be a more promising solvent for the liquefaction of C.
pyrenoidosa not only because the higher bio-oil yield (53.4%) and
conversion rate (86.3%), but also it is a renewable resource and
green reagent.

During the liquefaction of Spirulina in different organic solvents,
such as methanol, ethanol and 1,4-dioxane, similar results were
obtained [33]. Methanol and ethanol gave higher conversion rate
and bio-oil yield compared with 1,4-dioxane solvent. Furthermore,
the bio-oils produced from Spirulina in alcohols contained a large
amount of ester compounds, similar to biodiesel in composition.
The major components of bio-oils produced with methanol and
ethanol were hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (C17H34O2, 35.53%)
and hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester (C18H36O2, 26.27%), respectively.
When Spirulina was operated with 1,4-dioxane, the bio-oil was
dominated by hexadecanenitrile (C16H31N, 22.7%). Zhou et al. [37]
investigated the liquefaction of Enteromorpha prolifera in meth-
anol/ethanol and further confirmed that alcoholic solvent favored
the formation of ester compounds. A variety of fatty acid methyl/
ethyl esters (above 60%) were found in the bio-oil products.

4.1.3. Sewage sludge

So far, a few researches were devoted to studying the liquefac-
tion behaviors of sewage sludge in different solvents. In a work of
Huang et al. [54], it was found that using methanol or ethanol as
liquefaction solvent generally resulted in higher conversion rates.
Acetone usually gave higher bio-oil yields, but the energy density of
bio-oils was relatively low. The main components of the bio-oils
obtained in methanol/ethanol treatments were esters (methyl or
ethyl). However, the bio-oil obtained in acetone runs mainly con-
sisted of ketones and N-containing compounds. Ethanol was rec-
ommended as the solvent for the energy recovery from sewage
sludge by liquefaction.

The currently reported studies have shown that there are some
differences among the influences of solvents on the liquefaction
behaviors of different biomass species. For the lignocellulosic ma-
terials, acetone, 1,4-dioxane and phenol will possess higher effi-
ciency during the liquefaction process. As
to the
liquefaction of algae and sewage sludge, ethanol usually performs
better. Further research is needed to select effective solvent with
proper catalyst to narrow the product distribution and produce
desired compounds to make the process more industrial. In addi-
tion, the effect of solvent polarity on the liquefaction behaviors of
organic wastes, especially animal manure, needs to be further
studied. The techno-economic analysis of the bio-oil production via
the liquefaction of biomass in different solvents is yet to be carried
out.

4.2. The effect of biomass type

Table 3 lists the recent researches devoted to investigating the
effect of biomass type on the liquefaction behaviors of biomass.
According to the object investigated, related studies can be grouped
into two categories: (i) comparative liquefaction of biomasses
within the same category but of different properties, such as
different lignocellulosic materials; (ii) comparative liquefaction of
biomasses in different categories, such as algae versus lignocellu-
losic materials.

4.2.1. Comparative liquefaction of different lignocelluloses

The distribution of liquefaction products obtained from the
liquefaction of lignocellulose is mainly determined by the content
of lignin in the biomass feedstock. In general, the higher the lignin
content in the feedstock, the lower the conversion rate and bio-oil
yield. Minowa et al. [55] comparatively liquefied several agricul-
tural/forest residues and calculated the correlation coefficients (R)
between the products' yields and the chemical compositions of raw
materials. A high correlation only between lignin and residue yield
was observed (R 1⁄4 0.702). The residue yield increased with the
studied the aqueous
lignin content. Zhong and Wei

liquefaction of four woody materials and found that the yield of
bio-oil decreased with the increasing lignin content, while the yield
of residue showed the opposite tendency. The highest bio-oil yield
of about 31% was obtained from Fraxinus mandshurica duo to its low
lignin contents. It was thought that the phenoxy radicals could be
formed from the lignin in a hot state, and they were able to
condense and repolymerize to a solid mass. Therefore, higher lignin
content resulted in a higher residue yield by condensation and
repolymerization.

The content of holocellulose in lignocellulosic biomass could
also alter the distribution of liquefaction products. The decompo-
sition of holocellulose favors the formation of water-soluble hy-
drocarbons rather than oily (water insoluble) compounds, which
thus results in a low yield of the bio-oil. Wang et al. [57] converted
four agriculture residues (legume straw, cornstalk, cotton stalk and
wheat straw) into bio-oil products by the deoxy-liquefaction pro-
cess (a specially designed liquefaction process for in-depth removal
of oxygen). Although the conversion rate of cotton stalk was found
to be the highest (65.7%), the bio-oil yield of cotton stalk was the
lowest (5.2%). This result was ascribed to the fact that the content of
holocellulose in cotton stalk was the highest among the four
samples.

The content of various components in lignocellulosic biomass to
some extent determines the compositions of bio-oils. The degra-
dation of lignin mainly forms the phenolic compounds, whereas

the decomposition of cellulose yields a large amount of furan de-
rivatives. Karag€oz et al. [32] carried out the liquefaction of wood
(sawdust) and non-wood biomass (rice husk), and major biomass
components, i.e. lignin and cellulose, at identical conditions. The
bio-oil (ether extract) from the liquefaction of cellulose mainly
consisted of furan derivatives whereas the lignin-derived bio-oil
contained a lot of phenolic compounds. The compositions of bio-
oils from sawdust and rice husk contained both phenolic com-
pounds and furans. However, phenolic compounds were dominant.
Tymchyshyn and Xu [58] conducted the liquefaction of sawdust,
cornstalk,
lignin and cellulose for the production of phenolic
compounds (Fig. 7). According to the yields of phenolic/neutral bio-
oil, the above four feedstocks can be ranked in the order of
lignin > sawdust > cornstalks > cellulose. Significant quantities of
phenolic compounds were present in the resulting phenolic/
neutral bio-oils from sawdust, cornstalk, and pure lignin. The
relative concentration of phenolic compounds in the lignin-derived
bio-oil was as high as about 80%. As expected, the liquid products
from cellulose contained essentially carboxylic acids and neutral
compounds. Above results further confirmed that phenolic com-
pounds mainly derived from the degradation of lignin.

4.2.2. Comparative liquefaction of different algae

The relationship between the compositions of algae biomass
and its' liquefaction behavior has been widely explored. Different

algal biomasses have distinct liquefaction behaviors. Some impor-
tant and valuable conclusions can be drawn as follows: (i) the
higher the lipid content, the higher the bio-oil yield; (ii) the bio-oil
formation follows the trend lipids > proteins > carbohydrates.
Lipids form bio-oil yields of 80e55%, protein 18e11% and carbo-
hydrates 15e6%.; (iii) the bio-oil yields from the different algae are
not only derived from the lipid fraction but also from the protein
and carbohydrate fraction. Proteins produce large amounts of ni-
trogen heterocycles, pyrroles and indoles. Carbohydrates produce
cyclic ketones as well as phenols while lipids are converted to fatty
acids; (iv) it is more suitable to convert high lipid containing algae
in water or in a reducing atmosphere such as that produced using
formic acid; (v) high-protein microalgae are best processed without
the use of catalyst; (vi) higher carbohydrate microalgae are best
processed using alkali catalyst [59e61].

Biller and Ross [59] comparatively liquefied a range of model
biochemical components and four algae biomasses (Chlorella vul-
garis, Nannochloropsis occulata, Spirulina and Porphyridium) in wa-
ter (Fig. 8). Two high-lipid microalgae (C. vulgaris and N. occulata)

and the model lipid (sunflower oil) produced higher bio-oil yields
than other algae biomasses and modal substances, especially in
pure water or with formic acid as catalyst. High-protein microalgae
(Spirulina) and model proteins (albumin and soya protein) gave
higher bio-oil yields without the use of catalysts. The liquefaction of
high-carbohydrate microalgae (Porphyridium) and model carbo-
hydrates with sodium carbonate as catalyst showed higher bio-oil
yields. In addition, the bio-crude yields from four algae biomasses
were generally higher than those from the model compounds
(apart from sunflower oil), indicating that three components (lipid,
protein and carbohydrate) in algae biomass all can form bio-oil.

Toor et al. [60] further confirmed that the algae with high lipid
content will produce more bio-oils. It was reported that Nanno-
chloropsis salina had higher bio-oil yield (46%) than Spirulina pla-
tensis (38%). The liquefaction behaviors of three different species of
macroalgae (Ulva lactuca, Laminaria japonica and Gelidium amansii)
were investigated by Li et al. [61]. Higher yields of bio-oils were
obtained from U. lactuca due to its higher lipid and protein con-
tents. L. japonica had higher yield of residue, which may be related

to the higher ash content in L. japonica feedstock. The relative
content of nitrogen containing compounds (17.67%) in the bio-oil of
U. lactuca was obviously higher than that of L. japonica (10.05%) and
G. amansii (16.42%), which was closely related to their protein
content in algal feedstocks. And the relative content of alkenes was
8.46%, 1.53% and 2.04% for the oils from U. lactuca, L. japonica and G.
amansii, respectively, which was consistent with the lipid content
of the three feedstocks. The relative content of phenol derivatives
was 21.89%, 36.58% and 40.87% in the bio-oil from U. lactuca, L.
japonica and G. amansii, respectively. The high content of phenol
derivatives was consistent with the high content of carbohydrate in
macroalgae.

4.2.3. Comparative liquefaction of algae and organic waste/
lignocelluloses

The influence of the distinct compositions of algae and organic
waste/lignocelluloses on the distributions and compositions of
liquefaction products was also systematically studied [40,62,63].
Significant differences existed in the yields and chemical properties
of the bio-oil products. In general, the algae biomass and organic
waste (strongly modified biomass) are relatively easy to be con-
verted. The bio-oil from algae biomass usually contains a lot of
nitrogenous compounds and esters due to it higher lipid and pro-
tein contents. As regards to the lignocellulosic biomass, the bio-oil
mainly consists of phenolic compounds derived from the degra-
dation of lignin component.

Vardon et al. [62] comparatively liquefied an algal biomass
(Spirulina) and two organic wastes (swine manure and digested
sludge) in water. The bio-oil yields ranged from 9.4% (digested
sludge) to 32.6% (Spirulina). The high protein content of Spirulina
produced bio-oil that contained a high percentage of nitrogenous
compounds (O-decylhydroxylamine, 11.8% of the total chromato-
gram). The swine manure feedstock, with a more balanced distri-
bution of bulk carbohydrates and crude lipids, produced bio-oil that
contained a mix of phenolic- and lipid-derived compounds,
including pentanoic acid (11.1%), ethylphenol (10.1%), hexanoic acid

(5.2%), methylphenol (3.9%) and cholesterol compounds (2.5%). The
digested anaerobic sludge feedstock, which was mainly comprised
of cellulose, lignin and crude protein, resulted in bio-oil containing
a high percentage of ester, phenolic and nitrogenous compounds,
such as dodecyl acrylate (3.8%), benzoylformic acid (3.5%), phenol
(2.9%), and O-decylhydroxylamine (2.7%). Molecular weights
tracked with the obdurate carbohydrate content and followed the
order of Spirulina < swine manure < digested sludge. A similar
trend was observed in the boiling point distributions and the long
branched aliphatic contents.

Huang et al. [40] further compared the liquefaction behaviors of
algae biomass (Spirulina), lignocellulosic biomass (rice straw) and
organic waste (sewage sludge) in ethanol (Fig. 9). The yield of bio-
oil from sewage sludge reached up to 39.5%, higher than those from
rice straw (21.1%) and Spirulina (34.5%). Besides, the bio-oils from
sewage sludge had the highest heating value (36.14 MJ/kg). How-
ever, Spirulina showed the highest conversion rate (79.7%). As ex-
pected, the major compounds in the bio-oil from rice straw were
phenolic compounds. In case of sewage sludge and Spirulina, esters
were the main compositions. The volatility distribution of hydro-
carbons in bio-oils produced from sewage sludge and Spirulina
were distributed at C17 and C20, whereas they were distributed at C8
in rice straw-derived bio-oil. Lemoine et al. [63] liquefied a
microalgal biomass and two organic wastes (solid municipal
wastes, primary sludges) in tetralin and MeTHF. It was found that
MeTHF was more efficient than tetralin for the treatment of the
strongly bio-degraded organic wastes, while better results were
obtained with tetralin in the case of microalgae.

Liquefaction technology has been applied to a wide range of
biomass such as sewage sludge, animal manure, lignocelluloses and
algae. As the major biomass components such as lipid, protein,
lignin, and carbohydrate behave differently during the liquefaction
process, heterogeneity in biomass feedstock will
lead to the
modification in the distribution and composition of liquefaction
products. Thus, it is important to carry out the feedstock charac-
terization and selection based on the intended downstream

application. In the future, techno-economic analysis of the bio-oil
production via liquefaction of different biomasses should be
further comparatively studied.

4.3. The liquefaction of biomass in ethanol

Adopting ethanol as liquefaction solvent has several advantages
(Fig. 10): first, the critical point of ethanol (243 (cid:2)C, 6.4 MPa) is far
below that of water (374 (cid:2)C, 22.1 MPa), so much milder reaction
conditions can be obtained. Second, ethanol can provide active
hydrogen as a hydrogen-donor in the liquefaction process. Third,
ethanol can react with acidic components in the bio-oil by esteri-
fication reaction to obtain fatty acid ethyl esters similar to biodiesel.
Finally, due to the relatively lower dielectric constant, ethanol can
readily dissolve relatively high-molecular weight products derived
from biomass [38,64].

In view of the economic and environmental perspective, suit-
able solvent of commercial interests tended to be those derived
from the biomass itself [53]. Therefore, among all the sub-/super-
critical organic solvents, ethanol may be the most promising one
for biomass liquefaction. The reason is that not only is it effective
for liquefaction, but also it is a renewable source that can be pro-
duced from the bio-conversion of cereals, sugars and lignocellulosic
materials (sawdust, wood chips and agricultural residues) [65,66].

So far, the sub- and super-critical ethanol has been widely applied
to the liquefaction of various biomasses including lignocelluloses,
microalgae and sewage sludge (Table 4).

the present of FeSO4, the content of aromatic and heterocyclic
compounds obviously increased, while the content of phenolic
compound decreased.

4.3.1. Application in the liquefaction of lignocelluloses

Lots of work in this field was paid on optimizing the liquefac-
tion parameters. As regards to different lignocelluloses, the effects
of liquefaction parameters are different. Xu and Etcheverry [66]
carried out the liquefaction of pine sawdust in ethanol and
found that a high bio-oil yield of 63% (daf.) was obtained with
FeSO4 at 350 (cid:2)C and 5 MPa of H2 for 40 min. The phenolic com-
pounds were dominant in the bio-oils, irrespective of whether or
what catalyst was used. On the contrary, Chumpoo and Pra-
sassarakich [64] reported that the addition of FeSO4 in the lique-
faction of sugar cane bagasse in ethanol could not only
significantly promote the yields of bio-oil and conversion rate, up
to 73.8% (daf.) and 99.9% (daf.), respectively, but also alter the
compositions of the bio-oils. Without catalyst, the dominant
components were found to be phenolic compounds and esters. In

The liquefaction behaviors of rice husk and rice stalk in ethanol
were explored by Huang et al. [67] and Li et al. [68,69], respectively.
NaOH was certified to be an ideal catalyst for rice husk liquefaction,
and the optimal dosage was approximately 10%. In addition, the
addition of NaOH increased the content of alkanes but reduced the
content of ester in bio-oil products because NaOH enhanced the
dissociation of fatty acid into anionic form and then the decar-
boxylation of fatty acid, producing alkanes, was improved, while
the esterification reactions between fatty acid and ethanol, forming
esters, were relatively weakened [67]. Under the optimized con-
ditions, i.e. 325 (cid:2)C, a rice stalk/ethanol ratio of 1/10 (g/mL), and a
residence time of 60 min, the rice stalk conversion rate and bio-oil
yield reached 78.32% and 55.03%, respectively [69]. The torrefaction
pretreatment of rice stalk could enhance the bio-oil properties. The
bio-oil from torrefied rice stalk has higher heating values of
31.57e32.53 MJ/kg versus 28.95 MJ/kg of rice stalk-derived bio-oil.

70

H.-j. Huang, X.-z. Yuan / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 49 (2015) 59e80

Moreover, the torrefaction pretreatment also reduced the acid
content in bio-oil and increased the alcohol content [68].

As well known, ethanol can be obtained from lignocellulosic
biomass through fermentation technology [70]. An interesting pa-
per was reported by Lu et al. [71], which focused on liquefying the
fermentation residues of reed and corn stover in the presence of
ethanol. The optimum reaction conditions were at a liquefaction
temperature of 260 (cid:2)C, a liquefaction reaction time of 2.5 h, and an
aluminum chloride loading of 5% (reed) or 10% (corn stover). The
addition of aluminum chloride could promote the fractures of the
methoxy group, CeC and CeO of lignin in the fermentation resi-
dues. Brand et al. [72] investigated the liquefaction of pinewood in
ethanol and found that the reaction temperature and reaction time
have a more significant effect on pine sawdust conversion and
product yield than pressure and biomass-to-solvent ratio have. A
high conversion rate of 98.1% and high bio-oil yield of 65.8% have
been achieved at 400 (cid:2)C, 120 min, and a biomass-to-solvent ratio of
0.06 g/g.

The primary reaction route/mechanism of lignocelluloses in
ethanol has also been proposed. Liu et al. [73] applied the method
of lump analysis to the explanation of the reaction route of corn-
stalk in sub-/super-critical ethanol (Fig. 11). The reversible reaction
between heavy oil and volatile organic compounds occurred in the
liquefaction process, and the decrease in the water-soluble oil yield
was mainly attributed to the conversion of water-soluble oil to gas.
The bio-oil was converted into residue as the form of C and N after
the reaction temperatures reached 300 (cid:2)C and 260 (cid:2)C, respectively.
The mechanism of ketone formation from cellulose liquefaction in
ethanol (Fig. 12 [74]): Cellulose was firstly converted to active cel-
lulose which was transformed into aliphatic ketones such as 4-
hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone by dehydration, decomposition,
ring-opening reactions, isomerization and aldol condensation; The
alicyclic ketones (cyclopentenone) were formed by the cleavage of
CeOeC and CeC bonds of the active cellulose under the effects of
ethanol free radicals; Aromatic ketones (2-(formyloxy)-1-phenyl
ethanone) were generated by cyclopentenone reaction with in-
termediates; Aromatic ketones were decomposed to carboxylic
acids and small molecule ketones under ethanol free radicals.

4.3.2. Application in the liquefaction of algae

Ethanol was also applied to the liquefaction of several types of
algae biomass, such as Dunaliella salina [75], E. prolifera [76] and

Spirulina [65]. The bio-oil produced from the liquefaction of algal
biomass in ethanol usually contains a large amount of fatty acid
esters [65,75]. The formation routes of ester component include
three ways: (i) the transesterification of lipids (triglycerides); (ii)
the esterification of some free fatty acids with alcohols; (iii) the
esterification and substitution of organic acids from the decom-
position of carbohydrates and proteins [37,54].

During the liquefaction of D. salina, Ni/REHY, a solid acid
catalyst, was found to be very effective. The significant increment
of bio-oil yield was obtained using Ni/REHY catalyst, about 20%
more compared with that obtained without Ni/REHY. The domi-
nant compounds of the bio-oils were found to be esters, glycerins
[75]. The yields of bio-oil, obtained from the liquefaction of E.
prolifera, peaked at 300 (cid:2)C and 30 min of reaction time, up to
36.7%. The bio-oil primarily consisted of oxy-compounds with
carbon atoms under C10 [76]. As for Spirulina microalgae, the bio-
oil yields were in the range of 35.4e45.3% without any catalyst.
The FeS was certified to be an ideal catalyst and the optimal
dosage was ranging from 5% to 7%. Fatty acid ethyl ester com-
pounds were dominant in the bio-oils, irrespective of whether a
catalyst was used [65].

4.3.3. Application in the liquefaction of sewage sludge

The liquefaction behaviors of sewage sludge in ethanol were
investigated by Li et al. [77]. The higher the reaction temperature
was, the higher the bio-oil yield was obtained during the scope of
tested reaction temperatures (260e400 (cid:2)C). Significant increments
of the bio-oil and residue yields were obtained at high solvent
filling ratios (the volume of ethanol to that of the reactor). The
addition of iron-based catalysts (FeSO4, FeCl3, FeS, and FeCl2) could
promote the catalytic activity of hydrogenation for free radicals and
so obviously improved the yield of bio-oil. Esters and acids were

4.3.4. The hydrogen donation mechanism of ethanol

One of the main advantages of adopting ethanol as liquefaction
solvent is that the ethanol is a hydrogen donor. The hydrogen
generated from sub-/super-critical ethanol serves as a hydro-
genolysis agent to depolymerize biomass, a deoxygenation agent to
remove oxygen from biomass via H2O formation, and a radical
quenching agent to retard repolymerization and formation of char/
tar [72]. Fig. 13 presents the main possible hydrogen donation
mechanisms of ethanol. The first mechanism proposes the initial
donation of a-hydrogen in hydride form, and the formation of an
electron-deficient hydroxylalkylation species [78]. The second
mechanism, resembling the MeerweinePondorffeVerley reduc-
tion, consists of ethanol reduction which leads to alkoxide ion and
proton transfer, followed by a-hydrogen donation and aldehyde
formation [79,80]. The third mechanism indicates that in addition
to the a-hydrogen and proton donation, the cleavage of the hy-
droxide ion and proton from ethanol may also occur, and hydrogen
donation may saturate the double bonds in C2H4, resulting in the
formation of alkenes [72].

Different biomasses have distinct liquefaction behaviors in sub-
and super-critical ethanol. The specific reason may be that the
interaction between biomass and ethanol presents different forms
and intensities. However, the specific interaction between biomass

and ethanol is not completely clear, which requires to be further
investigated. Compared with adopting water as solvent, higher-
quality bio-oil could be obtained with ethanol as solvent. The bio-
oils have higher caloric value and contain a lot of ester com-
pounds, which are similar to biodiesel.

4.4. The liquefaction of biomass in organic solventewater mixed
solvents

As elaborated in Section 3, the use of water or organic solvents
as liquefaction solvent has its own advantages and disadvantages.
In view of this, the liquefaction of biomass in organic solvente-
water mixed solvents is proposed to combine the advantages of
water and organic solvents. The involved organic solvents mainly
include low molecular weight organic acids, alcohols, and pheno-
lics. The presence of organic solvents owns some obvious advan-
tages. The first obvious advantage of organic solvent is that it
improves the solubility of biomass and its decomposition products.
Second, some organic alcohol and acid solvents, such as methanol/
ethanol, own a low critical point of the supercritical condition, as
shown in Table 1. There is a possibility that the value of the reaction
temperature and/or pressure of decomposition of biomass can be
decreased by the presence of alcohols or organic acids. Moreover,

methanol/ethanol can be used as a hydrogen donor in biomass
liquefaction, which is in favor of low oxygen content bio-oil pro-
duction [19].

4.4.1. Application in the liquefaction of lignocelluloses

As shown in Table 5, organic solventewater mixed solvents
have been applied to the liquefaction of various lignocelluloses,
such as sawdust [81e83], cornstalk [84e86], rice straw/husk
[87e89], wheat straw [90], barks [91], and giant miscanthus [92].
A common conclusion is that the use of organic solventewater
mixed solvents could further enhance the degradation of ligno-
celluloses, resulting in higher conversion rate and bio-oil yields.
Cheng et al. [81] found that the 50% co-solvent of either meth-
anolewater or ethanolewater was the most effective solvent for
the liquefaction of white pine sawdust (Fig. 14). The 50% (W/W)
aqueous alcohol at 300 (cid:2)C for 15 min produced a bio-oil yield at
approximately 65% and a biomass conversion rate of >95%, higher
than the arithmetic average of those from the liquefaction in
mono-solvents of ethanol or methanol and water. Xu et al. [82]
also found that the liquefaction of pine sawdust in methanole-
water mixed solvents (W/W, 5:5) at 180 (cid:2)C gave the highest
conversion rate (62.7%). Zhao et al. [83] further reported that the
isometric methanolewater possessed the highest synergic effect
in the liquefaction of pine sawdust.

Methanolewater, ethanolewater and phenolewater all exhibi-
ted a synergic effect on the liquefaction of cornstalk for producing
bio-oil/phenolics. The isometric methanol and water mixed solvent
was found to be most effective at 300 (cid:2)C for 30 min. Under such
conditions, the conversion rate and the yield of main liquid prod-
ucts reached 88.1% and 52.4%, respectively [84]. The highest yield of
liquid products ((cid:4)70%), mainly consisting of phenolics, was ob-
tained at 250 (cid:2)C for 90 min with 65% vol. ethanolewater as the
liquefaction solvent [85]. The phenolewater mixture (1:4 (W/W))
was considered to be a more preferable liquefaction medium than

solvents,

including

ethanolewater,

the pure phenol during the liquefaction of cornstalk for producing
phenolic feedstock [86].
Various mixed

2-
propanolewater and 1,4-dioxaneewater, were tested in the lique-
faction of rice husk/straw [87e89]. For the liquefaction of rice husk,
the ethanolewater mixed solvents (V/V, 5:5) showed synergistic
effects at a relatively lower temperature (260 (cid:2)C), producing the
highest bio-oil yield (21.15%) [87]. The synergistic capability of
ethanolewater, 2-propanolewater mixture and 1,4-dioxaneewater
mixed solvents, especially with the ratio of 50 vol.%, could allow the
great decomposition of rice straw [88,89]. Ethanolewater mixed
solvents (V/V, 5:5) was also found to be the most effective in the
liquefaction behavior of wheat straw at 300 (cid:2)C and 10.0 MPa,
resulting in higher bio-oil yield (30.4%) and high heating value
(27.8 MJ/kg) as compared to neat water (16% and 20.7 MJ/kg) [90].
The best synergetic effect of ethanolewater in the liquefaction of
giant miscanthus was obtained at 280 (cid:2)C with isometric etha-
nolewater as the solvent. The conversion rate and the yield of bio-
oil were up to 91% and 50%, respectively [92]. In another study,
ethanolewater (V/V, 5:5) co-solvents were directly applied to
converting various barks into bio-oil production by liquefaction
[91].

Correspondingly, more obvious morphological changes of
biomass feedstock can be observed after liquefaction in organic
solventewater mixed solvents. As shown in Fig. 15(A) [84], the
microstructure of fiber bundles in cornstalk can be observed from
Fig. 15(A-a), but it was appreciably destroyed (Fig. 15(A-b)) during
significantly destroyed
cornstalk liquefaction in methanol,
(Fig. 15(A-d)) during cornstalk liquefaction in water and almost
completely destroyed (Fig. 15(A-c)) during cornstalk liquefaction in
isometric methanolewater.

The chemical composition of bio-oil can be controlled by
changing the ratio of organic solvent to water in the solvent for
biomass liquefaction. Increasing water content in the solvent could

promote the hydrolysis of biomass, while increasing alcohol con-
tent in the solvent could facilitate the alcoholysis/esterification of
biomass. Fig. 15(B) [84] represents the effect of the ration of alcohol
to water on the compositions of the bio-oil obtained by the lique-
faction of cornstalk. The relative content of esters basically tends to
decrease but that of the carboxylic acids largely increases with the
increase in water content in the solvent. The relative content of
phenolic compounds reached maximum when isometric meth-
anolewater mixed solvent was used. The relative content of ke-
tones, mainly derived from the hydrolysis of hemicellulose, largely
increases as the water content increases [84]. In addition, the
addition of methanol could promote the stability of the sugar de-
rivatives from further decomposition to carbonyl compounds, such
as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and levulinic acid. Using iso-
metric methanolewater as a solvent, the total content of the sugar
derivatives in the bio-oil produced from the liquefaction of sawdust
was up to 56.96%. However, the content of sugar derivatives
decreased to 2.85% when using pure water [82]. It was further
confirmed that
the highest content of phenolic compounds
(21.22%) was present in the bio-oil obtained from the liquefaction of
rice husk with the use of the isometric ethanolewater mixed sol-
vents [87].

4.4.2. Application in the liquefaction of algae

Some researchers also explored the feasibility of ethanolewater
mixed solvents as the liquefaction medium for algal biomass
[38,41,93]. In summary, the addition of ethanol could not only
elevate the bio-oil yield, but also improve the quality of the bio-oil.
Chen et al. [38] reported that the liquefaction of Dunaliella tertio-
lecta in ethanolewater (40%, V/V) gave the maximum bio-oil yield
of 64.68% (daf.) and conversion rate of 98.24% (daf.) (Fig. 16(a)).
Furthermore, the content of ester compounds in the bio-oil
increased with the increase of the ethanol content, whereas the
content of organic acids and amides showed an opposite trend
(Fig. 16(b)). The low organic acids reduced the acid value and

corrosivity of the bio-oil. The increase of fatty acid esters content
made the bio-oil similar to biodiesel.

Ethanolewater co-solvent was further tested as the reaction
medium in the co-liquefaction of coal and D. tertiolecta [93]. The
results indicated that ethanol and water also showed a synergetic
effect on the co-liquefaction of coal and D. tertiolecta. The optimal
bio-oil yield and conversion rate were 40.29% and 70.62%, respec-
tively, in ethanolewater (60%, V/V) at 360 (cid:2)C. Synergistic effects of
ethanol and water were further confirmed in the liquefaction of C.
pyrenoidosa [41]. All experiments using the co-solvent had higher
bio-oil yields and lower solid residue yields than any constituent

the standpoint of product distribution.

4.4.3. The role of constituent solvents in alcoholewater mixed
solvents

Among all the organic solventewater mixed solvents tested,
alcoholewater mixed solvents have been more commonly

employed. An advantage of using alcohols for biomass liquefaction
is that they are renewable chemicals, which can be derived from
biomass and they can be recycled and reused after the liquefaction
operation [30]. The role of the constituent solvents in the co-
solvent system for biomass liquefaction will be discussed.

teractions with solutes, such as hydrogen bonds and pep in-

the highest efficiency. Now that
solvents will present
the
biochemical components and structure of organic waste differ from
those of the terrestrial and algae biomass remarkably (see in Sec-
tion 2), the liquefaction behaviors of organic waste, i.e. sewage
sludge and swine manure, in mixed solvents should also be studied.
Moreover, further study should be carried out on the liquefaction of
other types of algal biomass in mixed solvents.

4.5. Advances in the liquefaction of sewage sludge

Sewage sludge is a typical organic waste, derived from the
treatment process of wastewater. Environment-friendly treatment
of sewage sludge has become tremendously important. The con-
version of sewage sludge into energy products by an environment-
friendly conversion process, with its energy recovery and envi-
ronmental benefits, attracts significant attention. Thermochemical
liquefaction of sewage sludge into bio-oils with proper solvents is a
promising technology. Currently, there are mainly two aspects of
researches carried out in the liquefaction of sewage sludge for bio-
oil products. One aspect of this work is to optimize the liquefaction
parameters for obtaining high conversion rate and bio-oil yield and
to determine the chemical/physical properties of the bio-oil prod-
ucts [77,94e98]. The other aspect of this work is to explore the
migration and transformation behavior of heavy metals during the
liquefaction process of sewage sludge [99e102].

4.5.1. The liquefaction of sewage sludge

Table 6 lists the recent researches on the liquefaction of sewage
sludge. In a previous work of Xu and Lancaster [94], the secondary
pulp/paper sludge powder was effectively converted into liquid
bio-oil products by direct liquefaction in hot-compressed water.
The highest yield of heavy oil (26%) was obtained with the presence
of 0.1 M Ca(OH)2 and 2 MPa H2 at 280 (cid:2)C for 60 min. It was found
that there were synergistic effects during the co-liquefaction of
secondary pulp/paper sludge and waste newspaper. The yield of
heavy oil was 26.9% at 300 (cid:2)C in the co-liquefaction of sludge and
waste newspaper (1:2, W/W), and was 9% and 6% higher than the
yields obtained from liquefaction of sludge and waste newspaper
alone, respectively [95]. The synergistic effects were believed to be
related to the inherent presence of alkali and alkaline earth metals
(Na, K, Ca, Ba, Mg, etc.) in sludge, which could catalyze the con-
version of volatile organic matter in the waste newspaper to heavy
oil products.

During the liquefaction of sewage sludge in water, the partition
of nitrogen in sewage sludge feedstock to bio-oil occurred at
>150 (cid:2)C. At Above 150 (cid:2)C, the distribution of nitrogen in the solid
residue decreased with increasing reaction temperature, with 60%
of the nitrogen distributed in the aqueous phase. The distribution of
nitrogen in bio-oil obtained by liquefaction at 300 (cid:2)C was 21% [97].
In addition, the yield of bio-oil produced from the liquefaction of
sewage sludge in supercritical water was dominated by the reaction
temperature and reaction time. There is an inverse correlation
between the bio-oil yield and reaction temperature. Although the
conversion rate of sewage sludge increases with reaction temper-
ature rising, under the consideration of economic viability and
lower reaction
waste reduce principle,
temperature makes the conversion of sewage sludge more work-
able. On the other hand, bio-oil yield always declines with reaction
time extension [96].

including nucleophilic, electrophilic, hydrolysis, and thermal
cracking/pyrolysis reactions, would occur [81]. The reactions of
biomass in water-based liquefaction consist of two steps: (i) hy-
drolytic and pyrolytic degradation and (ii) secondary cracking and
recombination. In contrast, the reactions in alcohol-based lique-
faction comprise the pyrolysis of the biomass and the interaction
between alcohol and reaction intermediates by hydrogen donation
and hydroxyalkylation (alcoholysis) [14]. The excess of water leads
to a higher amount of solid residues via self-condensation re-
actions, whereas using only alcohol as the solvent for the lique-
faction could lead to a reduction in free radical reactions due to its
weak acidity [92].

It was believed that the synergic effect between alcohols and
water on biomass liquefaction in their mixed solvents could not be
entirely ascribed to the change of structure and physical-chemistry
properties of biomass caused by sole solvent, but mainly due to the
interaction between organic solvents and water during biomass
liquefaction. However, the specific interaction between alcohols
and water is still to be clarified [83].

The use of organic solvents would decompose biomass in rela-
tive mild reaction conditions with the inhibition of residue

Sewage sludge-based activated carbon (SSAC), produced from
the pyrolysis of sewage sludge at 550/650 (cid:2)C, was explored as a

the yield and energy density of bio-oil obtained at 350 (cid:2)C. The
catalytic mechanisms of SSAC produced at different pyrolysis
temperatures differed. The metallic compounds were the catalytic
factor of SSAC obtained at 550 (cid:2)C, while carbon was the catalytic
factor of SSAC obtained at 650 (cid:2)C [98]. In another study, digested
anaerobic sludge was tested as feedstock for producing bio-oil by
hydrothermal liquefaction (in Section 4.2.3) [62]. And our research
group investigated the liquefaction behavior of sewage sludge in
sub- and supercritical ethanol (in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.3.3) [40,77].

4.5.2. The migration and transformation behavior of heavy metals

As well known, sewage sludge usually contains a certain quan-
tity of heavy metals, such as Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, Hg, and As
(concentrations vary from less than 1 mg/L to more than 1000 mg/
L), which is one of the main factors restricting the direct utilization
of sewage sludge. Hence, it is a significant problem whether the

heavy metals can be well treated/stabilized after the liquefaction of
sewage sludge. To solve this problem, special attention has been
paid on the migration and transformation behavior of heavy metals
during the liquefaction of sewage sludge and the main results are
summarized as follows (Fig. 17 [100]):

(i) The heavy metals in sewage sludge were mainly concen-
trated into the liquefaction residues of sewage sludge (about
80%). On the one hand, most of the organic substances in
sewage sludge were decomposed and converted into lique-
faction products, which made the relative content of heavy
metals in liquefaction residues increased. On the other hand,
the heavy metals were scarcely possible to be volatilized
during the liquefaction process now that the liquefaction
experiments were usually conducted below 400 (cid:2)C [99].
(ii) After liquefaction, the amounts of heavy metals bound to the
(acid soluble/

mobile and easily available fractions

fractions) were increased.

exchangeable and reducible fractions) were obviously
decreased. Accordingly, the proportions of heavy metals
present in the relatively stable fractions (oxidizable and re-
sidual
the
bioavailability and eco-toxicity of heavy metals in the
liquefaction residues of sewage sludge were relieved. The
marked changes of the physicochemical properties of sewage
sludge, such as pH, electronic conductivity, and organic
matter content, might be the reasons for the immobilization
of heavy metals. In addition, the liquefaction is a thermal
process, which may enhance the transformation of thermo-
dynamically unstable fractions, such as the reducible fraction
[100].

(iii) The leachability and environmental risk of heavy metals in
the liquefaction residues of sewage sludge were markedly
mitigated. The overall risks (potential ecological risk index
(RI)) of heavy metals were obviously lowered from 1093.56
(very high risk) in sewage sludge to 1.51e4.72 (low risk) in
liquefaction residues [100].

(iv) The heavy metals in the liquefaction residues of sewage
sludge can be further stabilized when NaOH was adopted as
the catalyst in the liquefaction process. The addition of NaOH
further changed the physicochemical properties of sewage
sludge and altered the speciation distribution of heavy
metals [99,100].

(v) The addition of lignocellulosic biomass during the liquefac-
tion process may further enhance the immobilization of
heavy metals in the liquefaction residues of sewage sludge
[102]. The synergetic mechanism can be speculated as fol-
lows: (1) the unstable or loosely absorbed heavy metals are
first dissolved under liquefaction conditions, and then can be
re-encapsulated or immobilized into the processed sludge
matrix and (2) the released heavy metals can also be further
entrapped by the enlarged structure of the lignocellulosic
biomass or chelated with some functional groups and then
fixed in the stable lignocellulosic biomass-sludge matrix
formed during the co-liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass
and sewage sludge, resulting in enhanced heavy metals'
immobilization effect [103].

(vi) It is worth noting that a small portion of heavy metals (less
than 10%) in raw sewage sludge will transfer to the bio-oil
products [77,101]. It was reported that the total concentra-
tions of Pb, Zn, Cu and Ni in bio-oils reached up to 6.7, 121.0,
30.6 and 7.9 mg/kg, respectively, much higher than that in
the regular petro-diesel (0, 0.11e0.14, 0.081e0.097 and
0e0.045 mg/kg for Pb, Zn, Cu and Ni, respectively).
Furthermore, the environmental risk of Zn and Ni in bio-oils,
evaluated by RAC (risk assessment code), was certified to be
undesirably high [101].

This liquefaction technology can not only convert sewage
sludge into the target product (bio-oil) but also mitigate the
mobility of heavy metals contained in sewage sludge, resulting in
no or low risk to the local ecosystem. The utilization of the
sewage sludge-derived liquefaction residues should be investi-
gated. The mobility and hazards of heavy metals in sewage
sludge-derived bio-oils should be further evaluated with proper
methods and indicators. Whether the concentrations of heavy
metals in sewage sludge-derived bio-oil are under the scope of
acceptable values? Further study should be carried out to answer
this question. In addition, during the liquefaction process, the
transfer behavior of some toxic organic pollutants existing in
sewage sludge, i.e., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, nonyl-phenols, etc., is still
unknown.

5. Conclusions

The conversion of biomass into energy is essential in order to
sustain our present and future. Various biomasses have been tested
as feedstock to produce bio-oil by direct liquefaction technology.
The liquefaction solvent type and biomass type are seen as the two
primary factors that determine the distribution and properties of
the liquefaction products. The characterization and selection of
biomass feedstock should be carried out according to the intended
downstream application. The use of water or organic solvents as the
liquefaction solvents has its own advantages and disadvantages.
Among the organic solvents, ethanol is the most promising one for
its high efficiency for biomass liquefaction and renewable ability.
The liquefaction of biomass in organic solventewater mixed sol-
vents could produce synergic effect and has extensive foreground
of application. Different from lignocelluloses and algal biomass,
sewage sludge usually contains considerable amounts of harmful
constituents, such as heavy metals and toxic organic pollutants
(PCBs, PAHs, dioxins, nonyl-phenols, etc.). Special attention should
be paid on the transfer and transformation behaviors of these
harmful constituents.

In the near future, research attention should be focused on the
following issues: (i) the selection of effective solvents with proper
catalysts to further narrow the product distribution and produce
desired compounds; (ii) the effects of solvent type on the lique-
faction behaviors of organic wastes, especially animal manure; (iii)
the techno-economic analysis of the bio-oil production via lique-
faction of different biomasses; (iv) the specific interaction between
biomass and ethanol during the liquefaction process; (v) the
liquefaction of sewage sludge: the utilization of the solid residues,
the mobility and hazards of heavy metals in bio-oils and the
transfer behavior of toxic organic pollutants. What is more to the
point, further studies are needed to make the process cost of
biomass liquefaction competitive with petroleum-based fuels.
