Cool flames play a critical role in ignition timing, burning rate, burning limits, engine knocking, and
emissions in conventional and advanced combustion engines. This paper provides an overview of the
recent progress in experimental and computational studies of cool flames. First, a brief review of low-
temperature chemistry and classical studies of cool flames is presented. Next, the recent experimental
and computational findings of cool flames in microchannels, microgravity droplet combustion, counter-
flow flames, and turbulent combustion environments are reviewed. The flammability diagrams of differ-
ent low-temperature flames and their relations to hot flames in premixed and nonpremixed systems are
discussed. The impact of cool flames on turbulent combustion and knock formation is also highlighted.
Finally, future avenues in cool flame research, including the use of cool flames as a new platform for low-
temperature kinetic model validation, are presented. It is concluded that the understanding and control
of low-temperature combustion is critical for the development of future advanced engines and new fuels.

1. Introduction

The  study  of  cool  flames  has  entered  its  third  century  [1-5] ,
and the understanding of their structure and dynamics has evolved
with advancing kinetic understanding and experimental, diagnos-
tic,  and  computational  methods.  Due  to  recent  developments  in
alternative  fuels  and  advanced  engine  designs  [6-14]  as  well  as
the recent discovery of transient nonpremixed cool flames in mi-
crogravity  droplet  combustion  in  space  [15]  and  self-sustaining
cool  flames  in  counterflow  burners  [16,17] ,  research  interest  in
cool  flames  is  at  a  high  point.  Experimental  and  computational
advances  in  cool  flame  research  have  been  made  in  a  number
of  areas  and  have  led  to  new  observations  of  nonpremixed  and
premixed  warm  flames  [18-21] .  These  advances  have  provided
new platforms to understand the dynamics and chemistry of low-
temperature flames and assess their impact on new fuels and fu-
ture engine design.

1.1. Motivations for cool flame research

In  order  to  reduce  emissions  and  improve  fuel  efficiency  in
engines, high-pressure and low-temperature combustion strategies
such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) [7,8,22] ,
reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) [8] , partially pre-
mixed compression ignition (PPCI) [23-25] , advanced compression
ignition (ACI), and spark-assisted compression ignition (SACI) have
attracted great attention [26,27] . In traditional gasoline and diesel
engines,  combustion  is  dominated  by  transport-controlled  high-
temperature  premixed  flames  and  nonpremixed  flames,  respec-
tively.  However,  in  HCCI,  RCCI,  PPCI,  ACI,  and  SACI  engines,  au-
toignition and cool flames play a critical role in fuel consumption
and heat release rate (HRR) due to partial or complete fuel and air
premixing at a higher engine pressures, as seen in Fig. 1 for PPCI.
The  timescales  of  typical  low-temperature  ignition  (LTI)  of
hydrocarbon  fuels  and  a  comparison  with  the  characteristic
timescales in engines and turbulent flames are listed in Table 1 . It
is seen that at engine pressures (20-100 atm), the LTI timescale can
be comparable to or even shorter than the timescales of the en-
gine combustion processes, turbulent flow eddies, and flame burn-
ing. The formation of low-temperature cool flames has been ob-
served  in  both  diesel  spray  and  engine  experiments  [28,29]  and
in recent numerical studies [30,31] . The ability to understand and
control LTI, cool flames, and the transition from cool flames to hot
flames is critical for improving engine performance and reducing
emissions. Moreover, advanced engines often implement significant
amounts  of  exhaust  gas  recirculation  (EGR)  to  reduce  the  flame
temperature and pollutant emissions. EGR has strong kinetic and
dilutive effects in suppressing hot flames [32-34] , which can result
in cool flames becoming more prominent due to the LTI and flame
timescales becoming comparable [20] .

Cool  flames  also  play  an  influential  role  in  knock  and  super-
knock  in  standard  and  boosted  SI  engines  [35] .  As  engine  pres-
sures increase, the timescale of LTI decreases and HRR from the
cool flame stage increases. The reduction in ignition delay time and
the resulting formation of temperature and concentration gradients
after LTI may result in the transition from ignition wave propaga-
tion to engine knock [23,26,36-42] when the ignition wave speed
becomes comparable to the local acoustic speed. The ignition-to-
detonation  transition  can  potentially  cause  engine  knock  and  is
very  sensitive  to  low-temperature  chemistry  (LTC)  and  turbulent
transport  [41,43] .  While  knock  can  be  suppressed  by  using  very
lean mixtures, LTI can also cause low-speed pre-ignition in boosted
spark-ignition engines [44] .

Additionally, the LTC of jet fuels is also becoming more impor-
tant as lean premixed combustion strategies are implemented in
advanced gas turbine engines [45] . A study of alternative jet fu-
els by Colket et al. [46] showed that the measured derived cetane
number (DCN) has an approximately linear correlation to the lean
blowout limit. Note that DCN is extremely sensitive to LTC. How-
ever, in classical flame theory, only high-temperature flame chem-
istry is considered for flame extinction. The high degree of correla-
tion between DCN and the lean blowout limit suggests that LTI and
low-temperature flame chemistry play an essential role in govern-
ing the lean blowout limit.

Finally, various bio-derived fuels and fuel blends such as alco-
hols [47-50] , esters [9,13,51-57] , ethers [50,58,59] , farnesane [60] ,
furanics [11,61-63] , ketones [11,64,65] , and surrogate fuels [10,66-
2 emissions. These
68] have been investigated in order to reduce CO

functional  groups  and  thus  exhibit  very  different  levels  of  low-
temperature reactivity. Therefore, there is a great need to develop
a technique which can rapidly screen the low-temperature reactiv-
ity of alternative fuels and provide a convenient tool to quantita-
tively validate the performance of chemical kinetic models at low
temperatures.

1.2. Progress and challenges in cool flame studies

Since the first observation of cool flames by Davy in 1817 [1] ,
much  progress  has  been  made  in  the  study  of  low-temperature
flames.  Early  studies  of  premixed  cool  flames,  with  a  particular
focus on their oscillatory behaviors caused by thermo-kinetic in-
stabilities, can be found in previous reviews [3-5] . Table 2 shows
some of the major milestones of cool flame studies in the last 200
years.

While  the  first  few  observations  of  cool  flames  were  primar-
ily driven by fire safety and scientific curiosity [1,2] , the need to
understand the cause of “knock” in spark ignition engines led to
major  investigations  into  the  chemistry  of  hydrocarbons  at  low
temperatures.  The  focus  of  cool  flame  studies  in  the  1920s  and
1930s was centered on the observation of premixed cool flames
of alkanes, ethers, and aldehydes in flow tubes, flow reactors, flat
flames, sand baths, and hot surfaces [2-5,69-74] , usually in fuel-
rich  (e.g. (cid:3) >  4) mixtures.  Townend and co-authors  [ 73 , 75 ] ex-
tensively mapped the classic pressure-temperature (p-T a ) diagram
( Fig. 2 a) for the spontaneous ignition of various hydrocarbons up

to 30 atm. At low and high temperatures, the critical pressure for
high-temperature ignition (HTI) decreased with increasing temper-
ature (AB and CD in Fig. 2 a). However, Pease [72,76] revealed that a
negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region existed while inves-
tigating propane and butane oxidation. That is, over a certain range
of intermediate temperatures (BC in Fig. 2 a), the critical pressure
for HTI increased with the increase of temperature, suggesting that
two competing chemistries existed. In the NTC region, the radical
production via LTC was observed to become slower with the in-
crease of temperature due to faster dissociation of chain-branching
intermediates  at  higher  temperature.  There  was  also  an  island
within the NTC region (circled by BCGEB in Fig. 2 a) in which LTI
(first-stage ignition) alone occurred. At pressures above the BCGEB
island, two-stage ignition was observed with LTI preceding second-
stage HTI ( Fig. 2 b).

The  above  findings  prompted  extensive  studies  on  the  kinet-
ics of low-temperature chemistry. In 1951, Barusch et al. [77] sug-
gested that alkylperoxy radical (RO
2 ) and hydroperoxyl alkyl rad-
ical  (QOOH)  were  the  major  pathways  for  cool  flame  chemistry.
Bailey and Norrish further studied the low-temperature oxidation
kinetics of hexane in the cool flame region [78] . With the increase
of oxygen concentration, the experiments showed the sequential
transition from a cool flame to a two-stage flame to a hot flame.
Moreover, a kinetic scheme was proposed, pointing out that OH,
HO
2 , and QOOH radicals played a critical role as intermediate
species in cool flames. A skeletal low-temperature kinetic mecha-
nism that included these intermediate species was developed by
Knox  in  1965  [79] .  These  kinetic  experiments  in  the  1950s  and
1960s laid the foundation of the current understanding of detailed
LTC via the RO
2 and QOOH radicals and the second oxygen addi-
tion in cool flames [80-82] .

The understanding of the NTC phenomena in cool flames and
the development of early low-temperature kinetic models resulted
in  the  development  of  the  unified  chain-thermal  theory  (or  the
thermo-kinetic model) to explain the experimental observation of
the  oscillatory  cool  flames  in  static  reactors  [83-85] .  The  chain-
thermal theory showed that oscillatory combustion was possible
when the thermal feedback was coupled to the low-temperature
NTC kinetics. Moreover, it was shown that oscillatory cool flames

only  occurred  in  non-adiabatic  systems  when  there  was  enough
heat loss to suppress the formation of a hot flame. When apply-
ing the unified chain-thermal theory to propane oxidation in both
stirred and unstirred static reactors with heat loss and a reduced
kinetic model, Griffiths and co-authors [4,85-87] revealed that the
inhomogeneous temperature distribution and buoyancy in the re-
actor also affected the oscillatory behavior.

With the success of the chain-thermal theory and renewed in-
terest in engine modeling, the focus of cool flame studies in the
1980s  and  1990s  shifted  to  the  development  of  detailed  kinetic
models  to  predict  LTI  ( Fig.  2 b)  through  the  use  of  shock  tubes,
rapid compression machines, jet-stirred reactors, and flow reactors
[58,88-94] . Comprehensive detailed kinetic models for n -heptane
and other alkanes were published during this time [82,88,94,95] .
The availability of detailed low-temperature kinetic models made
possible the accurate prediction of LTI (first-stage ignition) in a ho-
mogeneous system.

However, at the turn of the millennium, many outstanding chal-
lenges  remained  in  the  study  of  cool  flames,  especially  in  es-
tablishing  a  self-sustaining  cool  flame  in  well-defined  configura-
tions.  Self-sustaining  cool  flames  are  difficult  to  achieve  at  low
initial temperatures and atmospheric pressure due to slow chain-
initiation chemistry. At higher initial temperatures, moreover, cool
flames transition to hot flames very quickly. Although increasing
the pressure strengthens cool flames, flames at high pressures are
more susceptible to buoyancy and instabilities. Recently, however,
microgravity droplet experiments have enabled the observation of
quasi-steady cool flames [15,19] . Moreover, by introducing plasma
and ozone chemical sensitization, self-sustaining nonpremixed and
premixed cool flames and warm flames in an atmospheric pres-
sure  laboratory  environment  have  been  established  [16,18,67,96-
98] . Turbulent combustion modeling has also gained insights from
LTI  and  cool  flame  propagation  under  engine  conditions  [31,99] .
Overall, many questions concerning cool flame dynamics have been
answered in the last several years ( Table 2 ). This review will di-
rectly  address  the  recent  progress  made  in  understanding  cool
flame dynamics.

1.3. Focus of the present review

There have been several review articles on cool flames [3-5] ,
LTC [12,82,100,101] , and plasma-assisted low-temperature combus-
tion [102,103] . However, all previous reviews of cool flames focused
on spontaneous ignition, low-temperature chemical kinetics, uni-
fied kinetic models, and/or oscillatory cool flames. At the present
time, no review articles are available on cool flame dynamics, in-
cluding extinction limits, propagation speeds, flame regimes, inter-
actions with turbulence, etc. Therefore, in this review article, we
will  not  go  into  details  of  the  spontaneous  ignition  and  oscilla-
tory phenomena of cool flames, which have been covered in past
reviews. Instead, our focus is to present an overview of the fun-
damentals and dynamics of low-temperature cool flames. The re-
cent progress in experimental and computational studies of both
nonpremixed and premixed cool flames will be discussed. Finally,
future challenges and opportunities of cool flame studies will be
presented, including their relationship to low-temperature chemi-
cal kinetic model validation, advanced engine design, knock forma-
tion, and fuel screening.

that  oxidation  of  fuels  with  low-temperature  reactivity  is  highly
dependent on temperature and the radical production processes.
Fig.  3 a  shows  the  computed  temperature  versus  time  history  of
a lean n -heptane/air mixture at 20 atm and an equivalence ratio
( (cid:3))  of  0.4  at  initial  mixture  temperatures  of  700 K  and  1000 K
with a comprehensively reduced mechanism [26] . At 700 K, there
is two-stage ignition. First-stage LTI occurs at 10 ms through which
the fuel is partially oxidized to intermediate species such as C
4 ,
3 CHO, and the temperature rise of the first stage is
CH
only about 200 K. This first-stage ignition process is governed by
low-temperature peroxy chemistry [47,56,82,88,95,101] (see the re-
actions in Fig. 4 and Table 3 and the associated discussions). Af-
ter first-stage ignition, the temperature rises slowly via oxidation
2 . As the tempera-
of the intermediate species by O
ture further increases to a critical temperature, second-stage igni-
tion occurs (at 25 ms in Fig. 3 a), after which a significant temper-
ature rise occurs and almost all the fuel and intermediate species
are oxidized to form H
2 . This second-stage ignition is
generally referred to as HTI, and the oxidation process at this stage
is governed by high-temperature chain-branching reactions. As the
initial mixture temperature becomes sufficiently high (e.g., 10 0 0 K
at 20 atm), the LTI stage and the associated low-temperature reac-
tivity disappear, and only single-stage HTI remains ( Fig. 3 a). There-
fore, the fuel oxidation chemistry and ignition processes are highly
dependent on the initial mixture temperature, pressure, and radi-
cal concentration.

the ignition delay decreases with increasing mixture temperature
( Fig.  3 b).  However,  for  intermediate  mixture  temperatures  (e.g.,
80 0–10 0 0 K), the ignition delay increases with increasing tempera-
ture due to kinetic competition. This region of non-monotonic mix-
ture reactivity is termed the NTC region and is fundamentally re-
sponsible for the existence of stable cool flames. Furthermore, if
there is radical addition in the initial mixture (e.g., by plasma dis-
charge), the first-stage ignition delay time decreases dramatically
and can be shorter than 100 μs ( Fig. 3 b). As previously shown in
Table 1 , the LTI timescale can be comparable to or even shorter
than the characteristic mixing and combustion timescales in en-
gines. Thus, through radical addition by plasma discharge, mixing
of combustion products, or extinction-reignition events, LTI can be-
come significant and can dramatically alter the subsequent HTI as
well as the species and temperature distributions.

The low-temperature chemistry of cool flames has been studied
extensively from the 1920s up to the present time [81,82,88,101] .
These studies have led to the detailed understanding of the per-
oxy chain-branching chemistry that drives the cool flame behav-
ior. A schematic of three temperature-dependent chain-branching
reaction pathways at low (below approximately 750 K), intermedi-
ate (approximately 750–1050 K), and high temperatures (above ap-
proximately 1050 K) is shown in Fig. 4 .

At  low  temperatures,  the  major  fuel  (e.g.  alkanes)  oxidation
pathways are summarized in Table 3 . The fuel oxidation process
starts with an H-abstraction of the fuel molecule (RH) by a radi-
2  via reaction R1 and forms a fuel rad-
cal such as OH, O, or HO

2 → QOOH → O

ical  (R).  The  fuel  radical  (R)  then  forms  an  adduct  with  an  O
2
2  via  reaction  R2.  The  internal  isomer-
molecule  to  produce  RO
2  will  lead  to  the  production  of  QOOH  via  reac-
ization  of  RO
tion R3a. QOOH will either decompose to form one OH (via reac-
tion R4a) or one HO
2  radical (via reaction R4b) or will undergo
2  addition  to  form  a  peroxy  hydroperoxyl  alkyl  radi-
a  second  O
cal (O
2 QOOH) via reaction R5. The subsequent decomposition of
2 QOOH produces ketohydroperoxide (OQ’OOH) and an OH radical.
O
Finally, OQ’OOH decomposes to form a ketoalkyloxy radical (OQ’O)
and another OH radical. Therefore, the low-temperature reaction
pathway from R → RO
2 QOOH → OQ’O + 2OH via
reactions R2, R3a, R5, R6a, and R6b produces multiple radicals and
is the low-temperature chain-branching pathway governing fuel oxi-
dation in cool flames. Note that at very low temperatures and high
pressures, it is possible that a 3rd (reaction R7) and 4th oxygen
molecule can be added to O
2 QOOH [105,106] to form a large oxy-
genated complex that can lead to chain branching or propagation.
However,  as  the  temperature  becomes  higher,  the  chain-
propagating  pathway  of  R  →  RO
2  →  QOOH  →  OH  +  cyclic
ether  (R4a)  become  so  fast  that  the  low  temperature
R → RO
2 QOOH → OQ’O + 2OH chain-branching
pathway is suppressed. Moreover, the reverse reactions of R2 and
R5 as well as the decomposition of RO
2  (R3b)
further  reduce  the  formation  of  RO
2 .  As  such,  the  slowdown  of
radical  production  results  in  the  so-called  NTC  effect  as  shown
in  Fig.  3 b.  The  NTC  effect  is  particularly  evident  in  flow  reac-
tor  [67,107,108]  or a  jet-stirred reactor [109-112]  experiments.
A  wide  range  of  intermediate  species  including  radicals  and
hydroperoxides have been quantified in these devices [112] .

The NTC crossover temperature is sometimes conveniently de-
fined as the temperature at which ketohydroperoxide formation is
maximized [119] . A more general definition defines the crossover
temperature based on mixture explosivity [118] . It is important to
note that the main competitive reactions with the chain-branching
reactions in the peroxy sequence are typically not formally chain-
branching, since they involve the production of either one or no
active radicals at low temperatures (regardless of the fuel). Addi-
tionally, pressure tends to increase the NTC crossover temperature
due to the shift in equilibrium of reactions such as R + O

low-temperature  fuel  reactivity  starts  around  530 K.  Moreover,
there is a clear NTC region between 600 and 750 K in which fuel
oxidation slows down. Fig. 5 a also shows that by increasing the
2 QOOH formation, the
branching ratio of QOOH decomposition to O
low-temperature reactivity decreases dramatically. As discussed in
[107,118,119] ,  the  O
2  decomposition  reac-
tions  are  the  main  contributors  to  the  NTC  effect  ( Fig.  5 a).  De-
pending on the C-O bond energy, for certain large oxygenated fu-
els such as dibutyl ether and diethyl ether, as shown in Fig. 5 b,
there may exist  two NTC regions [108,111] . The first NTC occurs
due to the competition for the QOOH radical between second O
2
addition and QOOH decomposition, and the second NTC is via the
competition for the fuel radicals between first O
2 addition and di-
rect beta scission [108] . Note that the OH radical concentration is
very  low  in  cool  flames,  which  makes  it  challenging  to  observe
at atmospheric pressure. Fig. 4 shows that to promote cool flame
chemistry, one can use plasma to produce active radicals at low
temperatures  to  accelerate  the  low-temperature  chain-branching
pathway to stabilize a cool flame. Recent studies have shown that
with non-equilibrium plasma and ozone, steady cool flames can be
established at atmospheric pressures [16,21,96,97,120-123] .

At  intermediate  temperatures  (750–1050 K),  fuel  oxidation  is
2 , as
thought to be governed by a branching process involving HO
shown  in  Fig.  4 .  The  key  reactions  for  radical  production  at  in-
termediate  temperatures  are  listed  in  Table  4 .  At  these  temper-
atures,  HO

tions R3b and R4b, respectively). A small alkyl radical (R’) formed

via  RO
R9b  to  form  an  active  OH  radical  and  an  alkoxy  radical  (R’O)
[124] . In addition, the reaction between an aldehyde radical (R’CO,
2  via  R9a  also  produces  an  active  OH  rad-
e.g.,  CH
ical  and  a  smaller  aldehyde  (e.g.,  CH
2 O).  Furthermore,  the  reac-
2 via reaction R10b leads to an (excited)
tion between R’O with O
2 .  Note  that  it  is  the  excited  state  of
aldehyde  molecule  and  HO
2 O ∗)  formed  via  reactions  R9a  and  R10b  that
formaldehyde  (CH
gives the faint blue, luminescence of cool flames [2,74] . The sub-
2  →  2OH  reaction  path-
2  →  H
sequent  CH
2  into  a  second  OH
way  via  reactions  R11-R15  then  converts  HO
radical. Therefore, the chain-branching reaction pathway at inter-
mediate  temperatures  appears  to  be  the  production  of  multiple
OH  radicals  via  the  smaller  radicals  (e.g.,  R’  and  R’CO)  formed
from the low-temperature sequence and via H
2 decomposition.
It should also be noted that this chain-branching process is rel-
atively  slow  and  is  sensitive  to  heat  loss  and  oxygen  concen-
tration.  As  will  be  discussed  later,  because  of  the  existence  of
this  intermediate-temperature  chain-branching  reaction  pathway,
a multi-stage warm flame can potentially exist between the cool
flame and the hot flame.

In summary, in combustion chemistry, there are different sets of
chain-branching reaction pathways that exist at low, intermediate,
and high temperatures, respectively [98,125] .
Low-temperature chain-branching pathway:

R → RO 2 → QOOH → O 2 QOOH → OQ’O + 2OH

(CB1)

Intermediate-temperature chain-branching pathways:

R’ + HO 2 → R’O + OH, CH 2 O → HCO → HO 2 → H 2 O 2 → 2OH
(CB2a)

R’CO + O 2 → aldehyde + CO + OH,
CH 2 O → HCO → HO 2 → H 2 O 2 → 2OH

High-temperature chain-branching pathway:

H + O 2 = OH + O

(CB2b)

(CB3,R16)

The  above  three  sets  of  chain-branching  reaction  pathways
can  explain  not  only  the  three-stage  ignition  processes  of  DME
[126-128]  and  n -heptane  mixtures  [129]  but  also recent  warm
flame experiments [18,19,21] . That is, in addition to the first-stage
cool flame, a second-stage warm flame governed by intermediate-
temperature  chemistry  (and,  potentially,  a  third-stage  hot  flame
governed) can be observed.

2.2. Validation of low-temperature chemistry using cool flames

2 ,  and  O

Despite extensive studies of cool flame chemistry [82,88,101] , it
should be noted that there still exist large uncertainties in the re-
action rates within low-temperature kinetics, even for extensively
studied fuels such as DME and n -heptane [107,114,115,117,121,130-
132] ,  due  to  the  large  molecular  structures  and  the  difficulties
of  quantitative  measurements  of  QOOH,  RO
2 QOOH  rad-
icals  at  low  temperatures.  Cool  flames  provide  a  new  platform
to  validate  low-temperature  chemical  kinetic  models  and  surro-
gate  fuel  models  [16,97,121,122,132,133] .  Shock  tube,  rapid  com-
pression machine, flow reactor, and jet-stirred reactor experiments
[12,52,55,67,68,134,135] have traditionally been used to determine
reaction  rates  and  validate  kinetic  models  ( Fig.  6 a).  Additional
measurements of flame extinction limits and laminar flame speeds
have  been  used  to  constrain  the  heat  release  rate  and  diffusive
transport  coupling  for  HTC  ( Fig.  6 b).  Accurate  description  of  the
heat release rate of a kinetic model is important for evolution of
coupled  chemico-physical  combustion  phenomena  such  as  lean-
burn  flame  blow-off,  acoustic  instability,  knock,  and  detonation.
However, for LTC, until very recently, there have been no such ex-
periments available to validate the heat release rate and transport
coupling for a full-strength (undiluted) mixtures. The implications
of this “experimental blind spot” are presented below.

To  illustrate  the  challenges  in  low-temperature  kinetic  model
validation  and  in  the  accurate  prediction  of  heat  release  rate,
Fig.  7 a  [121]  shows  the  comparison  of  the  predicted  and  mea-
sured nonpremixed flame extinction limits for large n -alkanes in
a counterflow burner. Reduced models containing 130–150 species
for each fuel for flame simulations were created from the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory detailed model [136] through a path
flux analysis method [137] .

A few significant issues regarding model discrepancy are illus-
trated  in  Fig.  7 a.  First,  the  measured  hot  flame  extinction  (HFE)
limits of the different n -alkanes were much closer together than
their cool flame extinction (CFE) limits, which were more sensitive
to the length of the main carbon chain. This agreed with previous
studies  [138-147] ,  which  concluded  that  large  n -alkanes  possess
very similar oxidation behavior at high temperatures but showed

large differences in the low-temperature reactivity. This is due to
the fact that LTC has a higher dependence on molecular structure
dependent than HTC.

Second,  the  reduced  models  only  slightly  overpredicted  the
HFE  limits  and  were  within  10–15%  of  the  experimental  values,
which was certainly within the uncertainties in the chemical ki-
netic model, transport properties, and thermodynamic properties.
However, a large discrepancy existed between the predicted and
measured CFE limits, which were predicted to occur for fuel mass
fractions  nearly  an  order  of  magnitude  higher.  Such  remarkable
disagreement was far larger than that for ignition delay and could
not be solely explained by the uncertainty in transport coefficients.
Therefore, it can be inferred that the cool flame heat release rate
and  its  coupling  with  diffusive  transport  (which  govern  the  CFE
limit) is not well constrained in current low-temperature kinetic
models. As such, the cool flame platform provides a crucial val-
idation  target  for  the  coupling  between  LTC,  heat  release,  and
transport.

Additionally, Fig. 7 b [121] shows the comparison between the
measured and predicted n -heptane HFE and CFE limits using the
detailed model from NUI-Galway [148] and reduced models with
131, 238, and 526 species. Once again, the HFE limits for n -heptane
were shown to be nearly insensitive to the reduced model size. On
the other hand, the n -heptane cool flames displayed a consistent

increase in reactivity as the model size decreases. In fact, it ap-
peared that most of the disparity between the 131-species model
and the experiment can be attributed to the model reduction pro-
cess. Even the 526-species reduced model showed a clear depar-
ture from the detailed solution of the original model with 1268
species. The detailed solution itself also had up to a 30% difference
in the prediction of the CFE limit. This large difference in the de-
tailed model likely originated from the uncertainty of the reaction
rates and heat release rates in LTC.

Disagreements between flame experiments and detailed kinetic
models can be divided into errors in chemical reaction rates, errors
in thermochemistry, and errors in transport coefficients. In general,
accurate  determination  of  transport  coefficients  is  a  crucial  fac-
tor in modeling flame extinction, especially for abundant species
such as oxygen, nitrogen, and fuel (with small radicals playing a
minor role) [145] . Reuter et al. [133] performed a transport sensi-
tivity analysis for CFE in nonpremixed DME cool flames with and
without  ozone  in  the  oxidizer  ( Fig.  8 ).  The  results  showed  that
the  most  important  species  in  terms  of  diffusive  transport  were

ozone  case).  A  transport  sensitivity  analysis  was  also  conducted
for an n -heptane nonpremixed cool flame with similar results (O

n -heptane, O
[16] . Therefore, it can be assumed that the majority of the errors in

highlights the uncertainties present in critical low-temperature re-
actions in current chemical kinetic models.

detailed chemical kinetic models are not due to inaccurate deter-
mination of transport coefficients (since the most sensitive species
are abundant and stable) but rather due to errors in reaction rates
and thermochemistry.

To understand the types of reactions that contribute to HRR of
nonpremixed cool flames, Fig. 9 compares the net HRR from reac-
tions involving species from C

action rate constants and thermochemistry for important species
at low temperatures (e.g., O

for the CFE limits.

Recently, the ignition and extinction of DME nonpremixed cool
flames  at  elevated  pressures  were  investigated  in  the  counter-
flow  configuration  by  Deng  et  al.  [132] .  Fig.  10  shows  the  mea-
sured  and  predicted  ignition  and  extinction  temperatures  as  a
function  of  the  pressure-weighted  strain  rate.  While  the  effects
of elevated pressure on ignition temperatures were predicted by
computations quantitatively, the effects on extinction temperatures
were significantly overpredicted when using the original mecha-
nism [113] ( Fig. 10 a). Through modifying the pre-exponential fac-

A  more  comprehensive  assessment  of  DME/CH

4  chemical  ki-
netic models was examined by Reuter et al. [133] . Comparisons be-
tween the models by Wang et al. [114] , Dames et al. [115] , Zhao
et  al.  [113] ,  UCSD  [149] ,  Burke  et  al.  [117] ,  and  HP-Mech/DME
[133]  for  nonpremixed  CFE  limits  and  ignition  delay  times  are
shown in Fig. 11 [133] . All of these models predicted experimen-
tal  ignition  delay  times  [150]  from  a  shock  tube  at  23 atm  well
( Fig. 11 a). However, a large disparity between the models for the
nonpremixed CFE limits was present ( Fig. 11 b). More recent mod-
els by Wang et al., Dames et al., and HP-Mech/DME significantly
improved the predictions of the experimental data. Nevertheless,
the disparities at high and low strain rates (i.e., the “slope” of the
line) remained unresolved.

Similar  levels  of  discrepancies  between  kinetic  models  were
also found for DME premixed cool flames [151] and nonpremixed
cool  flames  of  butane  isomers  [122] .  Therefore,  the  counterflow
cool flame is an unexplored and important platform for validating
low-temperature chemical kinetic models in combustion systems
which need to consider strong coupling between chemistry, heat
release, and transport (i.e., cool flames and knock).

3. Premixed cool flames

Cool flames were first discovered in fuel-rich premixed flames.
In  this  section,  we  will  review  the  progress  made  in  pre-
mixed  cool  flames  investigated  in  preheated  burners  and  reac-
tors, temperature-controlled micro-reactors, spherical flames, pla-
nar freely-propagating flames, and counterflow flames.

3.1. Preheated burner and reactor-stabilized cool flames

Since the first observation of cool flames [1] , experimental stud-
ies of cool flames have focused on premixed mixtures using a hot
surface,  a  flat  flame  burner,  or  a  wall-heated  reactor  for  ethers,
aldehydes, and alkanes. It was already established by the end of
the 19th century [2] that cool flames are common for a wide range
of fuel/air mixtures, especially for linear alkanes with carbon num-
bers greater than two. Detailed summaries of cool flame studies

through the mid-1990s can be found in the review articles of Lig-
nola, Griffiths, and co-authors [3-5] . In this review, we briefly dis-
cuss the major findings of cool flames during the 20th century.

As  mentioned  in  the  introduction,  Townend  et  al.  [75]  thor-
oughly  investigated  the  spontaneous  ignition  (through  p-T a  dia-
grams) of different hydrocarbons and oxygenates in heated closed
vessels. Hseih and Townend [152] extended this to include the in-
sertion of a hot wire in a closed tube. Fig. 12 a shows the imple-
mentation  of  this  method  to  measure  the  flammability  limits  of
diethyl ether/air cool flames at room temperature. Four different
temperatures of the heated wire, as well as a spontaneous ignition
case (i.e., at an elevated temperature), were tested. It was observed
that, at high enough pressures, either spontaneous ignition or arti-
ficial ignition by a heated wire can cause two-stage ignition.

Further flammability limit tests were conducted by Piazza et al.
[146] using an electrically heated coil of nichrome wire. The re-
sults for alkanes showed that the width of the flammability lim-
its increased with the molecular weight ( Fig. 12 b). Methane had
the narrowest flammability limits in terms of the equivalence ra-
tio (0.4 < (cid:3) < 1.6), while hexane had the widest (0.6 < (cid:3) < 3.9).
The limit curves for propane and higher alkanes possessed two dis-
tinct lobes—the richer of these lobes was deduced to be caused by

the cool flame. The color of the near-limit flames was also seen to
change with (cid:3)—the leanest ones were violet, the ones near stoi-
chiometric appeared sky blue, the moderately rich ones had green
appearance, and the richest ones were pale blue.

In a heated flow tube using fuel-rich aldehyde and ether/oxygen
mixtures [74] , Topps et al. demonstrated that a cool flame could be
formed and stabilized ( Fig. 13 a). It was also observed that when
the pressure was raised to a critical value, a second brighter “blue
flame” appeared after the cool flame, forming a two-stage flame
structure ( Fig. 13 b). When the pressure was further increased to
600 mmHg, the cool flame and blue flame merged, and the flame
luminescence increased. Analysis of the emission spectra of both
cool flame and blue flame showed almost the same bands in the
measured  spectra  despite  some  increase  in  the  intensity  in  the
blue bands near 470 nm.

In  order  to  control  the  separation  distance  between  the  cool
flame and blue flame and to allow for species sampling and spec-
troscopic studies, Williams et al. [153] used the vertical tube reac-
tor with precise temperature control of the reactor wall by using
film resistor heating [154] . They measured the spontaneous igni-
tion limits and composition limits for cool flames and blue flames
of  n -butane/oxygen/nitrogen  mixtures  (shaded  areas  in  Fig.  14 )

at the noted temperature. (b) Flammability limits of various alkanes at sub-atmospheric pressures (Reprinted from [146] with permission of ACS). The room temperature
fuel/air mixtures were ignited using a hot wire.

To  avoid  the  effects  of  walls  and  hot  surfaces  on  cool  flame
burning limits, Agnew et al. [156,157] and Foresti [158] used the
flat  flame  burner  developed  by  Powling  [159]  to  conduct  both
infrared and visible emission spectra measurements of stabilized
cool flames for rich diethyl ether mixtures ( Fig. 15 ). It was found
that at the lowest temperatures (the cool flame regime) the spec-
trum consisted only of emissions from excited CH
2 O (near 470 nm).
Agnew et al. [157] produced a flame regime diagram by varying the
fuel (diethyl ether) concentration ( Fig. 15 b). The regime diagram
showed that there were several different premixed flame regimes,
including a normal hot flame in a narrow near-stoichiometric re-
gion, a two-stage blue flame regime outside the fuel-rich flamma-
bility of the hot flame, and a single-stage cool flame regime for
highly  fuel-rich  mixtures.  Fig.  15 b  shows  that,  without  the  wall
heating  present  in  [153,155] ,  a  single-stage  cool  flame  and  two-
stage blue flame only existed on the fuel-rich side.

Ballinger and co-authors [160,158] further extended cool flame
studies by measuring flame structures with the flat flame burner
for  n -alkanes,  di- t -butyl  peroxide,  and  primary  reference  fuels
(PRF) with different additives. In the single-stage n -butane/oxygen
cool flame ( Fig. 16 a), they observed that the cool flame increased
the temperature from ∼650 K to ∼770 K (a 120 K increase). How-
ever, in the two-stage n -butane/oxygen flame ( Fig. 16 b), they es-
timated  that  the  leading  cool  flame  produced  a  more  substan-
tial temperature rise of ∼200 K. The results also showed that the
unattached cool flames were more sensitive to additives than the
attached flames. In general, antiknock additives such as tetraethyl
lead were found to delay the second-stage flame, while proknock
additives were found to advance the second-stage flame.

To understand the chemistry of the cool flame and two-stage
blue flame, Carlier et al. [161] conducted a measurement of species
in  a  flat  butane  flame  using  a  combination  of  gas  chromatog-
raphy,  polarography,  and  electron  spin  resonance  spectroscopy.
Fig.  17  shows  the  measured  mole  fractions  of  the  major  con-
2 mix-
stituents in cool and blue flames of the fuel-rich C
ture at 1.8 atm. It was seen that CH

were produced in the leading cool flame via the low-temperature
peroxy  chain-branching  pathway  (CB1).  In  the  second-stage  blue
flame,  CH

via the intermediate-temperature reaction pathway (CB2). The ma-
jor  reactions  in  the  second-stage  flame  were  R9a-R9c  (in  which

over a wide range of compositions [155] . The cool flame sponta-
neous ignition limit on the rich side far exceeded the hot flame
flammability limit. However, on the lean side, it was also shown
that the spontaneous ignition limit of the cool flame was always
narrower (higher fuel concentration) than the hot flame flammabil-
ity limit. Moreover, for n -butane fuel with a temperature gradient
of 2 to 3 °C per cm, the separation distance between pre-ignition
cool  flame  and  blue  flame  was  over  40 cm.  At  a  higher  oxygen
concentration, separated three-stage flames were observed. As dis-
cussed in Section 2 , these three-stage flames are the outcome of
the three chain-branching reaction pathways (CB1, CB2, and CB3 in
Section 2.1 ) at low, intermediate, and high temperatures.

However, the above research did not fully answer the follow-
ing questions: (1) Can a cool or blue flame exist in fuel-lean mix-
tures beyond the hot flame lower flammability limit? (2) Why does
the transition between fuel-rich cool flames and hot flames occur
smoothly  without  any  flame  extinction?  (3)  How  are  extinction
and ignition transitions influenced by fuel chemistry? (4) Finally,
how do pressure and flame stretch affect low-temperature flame
dynamics?

3.2. Cool flames in temperature-controlled micro-reactors

Similar  to  the  early  work  of  Williams  et  al.  [153] ,  in  order
to control the separation distance between the auto-ignited cool
flame and blue flame, Maruta et al. conducted systematic studies
of multi-stage premixed flames in micro-reactors by using exter-
nal  flame  heating  to  create  a  temperature  gradient  on  the  wall
for alkanes, ethers, PRFs, and other blended fuels at stoichiomet-
ric conditions and elevated pressures [128,129,163-168] . The exper-
imental setup of flame propagation in a micro-reactor can be seen
in  Fig.  18  [128] .  A  stoichiometric  premixed  fuel/air  mixture  was
supplied to a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 2.0 mm or less.
To control the temperature gradient of the reactor wall, an exter-
nal H
2 flame was employed. Due to the strong flame-wall thermal
coupling, the flame regimes were dictated by how much chemical
heat release was generated by the flame in addition to the wall
temperature boundary contributions. As such, the inlet flow veloc-
ity significantly affected the flame-wall thermal coupling and the
flame regimes. As shown in Fig. 18 b, a self-propagating hot flame
was formed at a high flow velocity due to large combustion heat
release. At  an intermediate flow  velocity ( Fig. 18 c), the combus-

tion heat release was not able to support a stable propagating hot
flame, resulting instead in a flame with repetitive extinction and
ignition. When the flow velocity was further reduced, a weak flame
[169,170] was formed ( Fig. 18 d). This weak flame could not prop-
agate by itself and was stabilized by the wall temperature gradi-
ent. In the weak flame regime, a cool flame, blue flame, and/or hot
flame could be formed depending on the fuel and flow velocity.
Detailed descriptions of the micro-reactor and flame dynamics can
be found in [128,163,170] .

To understand the effect of pressure on cool flames and blue
flames,  Maruta  and  co-workers  measured  multi-stage  flames  for
stoichiometric  n -butane/air  mixtures  in  a  micro-reactor  at  0.2–
1.2 MPa [167] . Fig. 19 a shows the pressure dependence of three-
stage cool, blue, and hot flames from 0.1–0.3 MPa. It is seen that
with the increase in pressure, both the cool flame and blue flame
intensities increased. Moreover, at higher pressures both the cool
flame and blue flame shifted slightly to a lower temperature loca-
tion.

Maruta  et  al.  [163]  also  extended  multi-stage  flame  studies
to  the  oxidation  of  stoichiometric  PRF  mixtures  to  understand
the effect of fuel molecular structure on the formation of multi-
stage flames in a micro-reactor. Fig. 19 b shows the dependence of
the multi-stage flame structure on different research octane num-
bers  (RON).  It  was  confirmed  that  for  a  RON = 0  mixture  (pure
n -heptane), an auto-ignited cool flame was clearly present in the
region where the wall temperature was 800 K. However, increas-
ing RON (by adding iso-octane to the mixture) weakened the cool
flame and slightly delayed the hot flame. At RON = 100 (pure iso-
octane), no cool flame structure could be seen. These results are
consistent with the role of different chemical functional groups on
low-temperature reactivity [68,134] in that branched alkanes and
aromatics tend to decrease the formation of cool flames [138,171] .
In summary, micro-reactor experiments provide a new platform
to understand the structures of cool, blue, and hot flames at high
pressures through reactor wall temperature control. These experi-
ments successfully demonstrated the effects of pressure, tempera-
ture, and fuel molecular structure on the chemistry governing cool
flames and hot flames. However, since flame transitions are very

13

is necessary to understand the dynamics of self-propagating low-
temperature  flames  and  the  transitions  between  different  flame
regimes.

3.3. Freely-propagating cool flames

The laminar flame speed is the one of the most important prop-
erties in all of combustion since it directly controls the heat release
rate of a mixture in the reaction zone. Although turbulent trans-
port may modify the flame speed in the preheating zone at very
high turbulent Reynolds number, at high flame Damköhler num-
bers the thin flamelet regime still holds [172] . However, previous
studies of the laminar flame speed have primarily focused on high-
temperature (hot) flames.

In  a  non-adiabatic  flame  with  Arrhenius  temperature  depen-
dence  of  the  reaction  rate,  the  flame  temperature  and  flame
speed  decrease  with  increasing  heat  or  radical  losses.  In  the
schematic  shown  in  Fig.  20 ,  similar  to  experimental  observation
( Fig.  14 ),  there  are  two  hot  flame  flammability  limits,  the  lower
lean flammability limit on the left and the upper rich flammabil-
ity limit on the right. The HFE temperature is about 1200 K (for
hydrogen/air mixtures) but can be higher depending on the mix-
ture. The high-temperature flame speeds and flammability limits
of methane and other fuels have been extensively measured us-
ing many different methods such as counterflow flames [173-175] ,
spherical flames [59,176-178] , and the heat flux method [179,180] .
However, there have been limited studies on the propagation and
flammability limits of premixed cool flames.

3.3.1. Spherically-propagating cool flames

To advance the understanding of cool flame propagation, Pearl-
man et al. [181-184] conducted microgravity experiments of pre-
mixed  cool  flames  aboard  NASA’s  KC-135  aircraft,  in  which  the
g -levels were effectively reduced to 10 −2 g. The experimental setup
consisted of an oven-heated fused-silica vessel with two intensi-
fied cameras measuring both visible and ultraviolet chemilumines-
cence. Fig. 21 shows the time-dependent progression of flame de-
velopment in microgravity with a fuel-rich mixture of 66.7% C

initial = 0.3 atm
and 33.3% O
vessel = 583 K. It was observed that the cool flame in normal
and T
gravity was strongly affected by buoyancy and was not spherical in
shape. The cool flame originated at the top of the vessel and prop-
agated downward ( Fig. 21 a). However, in microgravity conditions,

sensitive  to  radical  branching  and  chemical  heat  release,  strong
flame-wall coupling may introduce complexity in the validation of
radical branching process and heat release in the cool flame and
hot flame. Furthermore, the observed multi-stage flames only ex-
isted in the same wall-stabilized cool flame regime as the experi-
ments of Williams et al. [155] and therefore did not have their own
propagation speeds without the effect of wall heating. Therefore, it

the  cool  flame  developed  at  the  center  of  the  chamber,  where
the temperature is the highest, and propagated outward ( Fig. 21 b).
In [183] , Pearlman noted that heat was generated by pre-ignition
(“slow reaction”) prior to the formation of the cool flame. Thus, the
flame was likely governed by autoignition-assisted flame propaga-
tion, which is governed by both reaction-diffusive balance and au-
toignition (due to pre-ignition and the presence of a temperature
gradient), and not conventional flame propagation, which is driven
by a reactive-diffusive balance. These premixed experiments were
successful in demonstrating propagating premixed cool flames in a

ing hot flame. The single hot flame continued to propagate at a
speed of ∼25.6 cm/s until HTI occurred at 14 ms.

Therefore,  two  interesting  observations  were  apparent  from
this study. First, a propagating cool flame can exist for very lean
mixtures at engine-relevant thermodynamic conditions. Second, at
near-limit conditions, a hot flame can transition into a two-stage
“double” flame  in  which  the  leading  cool  flame  can  potentially
propagate faster than the hot flame. A recent transient numerical
simulation [151] has also shown that stoichiometric premixed cool
flames and a transient double flame propagation also can exist, al-
though in that case the cool flames were initiated first, and the
hot flames later caught up with them. Nevertheless, it remained
unclear how a cool flame could propagate faster than a hot flame

3.3.2. One-dimensional freely-propagating cool flames

To  understand  the  dynamics  of  near-limit  steady-state
cool  flames  and  their  relationship  to  hot  flames,  Ju  et  al.
[20,185]  conducted  numerical  simulations  of  one  dimensional
freely-propagating  DME  flames  using  an  arc-length  continuation
method [186] . Fig. 23 shows a schematic of the computed flame
temperature  dependence  on  the  equivalence  ratio  for  DME/O
2
mixtures at 1 atm. The existence of cool flames was seen to extend
the hot flame flammability limits for both lean and rich conditions.
Note that the transition between hot flames and cool flames was
found to be very different for lean and rich cool flames at atmo-
spheric pressure [185] . For rich conditions, the transition from hot
flame to cool flame was smooth without any extinction process.
At lean conditions, on the other hand, the hot flame extinguished
onto  the  cool  flame  branch.  Consequently,  the  transition  from  a
lean  cool  flame  to  a  lean  hot  flame  was  an  ignition  transition.
Therefore, Fig. 23 provides a complete picture of the relationship
between  hot  and  cool  flames  for  both  lean  and  rich  DME/O
2
mixtures at atmospheric pressure. A recent study of n -heptane/air
premixed  cool  flames  also  revealed  a  similar  extension  of  the
flammability limits [187] .

Ju [20] later simulated cool flame regimes and burning limits at
elevated pressure (up to 20 atm) using DME/air mixtures. Typical
distributions of temperature and species mole fractions of the dif-
ferent flame regimes of fuel-lean mixtures at an equivalence ratio
( Ф ) of 0.6 and a pressure of 2 atm are shown in Fig. 24 . While the
lean hot flame had a peak temperature of about 1900 K, the maxi-
mum temperature of the lean cool flame was only 750 K ( Fig. 24 a).

microgravity environment; however, due to the pre-ignition of the
unburned mixture, the measurements could not be used directly to
extract the laminar flame speed of freely-propagating cool flames.
As such, it remained unclear as to how fast a cool flame can prop-
agate.

With  the  progress  of  detailed  kinetic  model  development  for
cool flames and adaptive model reduction, Ju et al. [26] conducted
numerical  modeling  of  spark-assisted  flame  propagation  of  a
n -heptane/air  mixture  at  equivalence  ratio  of  (cid:3) = 0.4,  an  initial
temperature of 700 K, and a pressure of 20 atm ( Fig. 22 ). It was
seen that at 0.1 ms after ignition by a hot spot at r = 0 cm, a high-
temperature  flame  kernel  was  initiated.  However,  at  9.3 ms,  the
single hot flame front split into a two-stage flame front involving
a leading cool flame with a flame temperature around 820 K and a
trailing hot flame with a flame temperature above 1500 K. Fig. 22 b
shows the corresponding time history of the location of the max-
imum HRR at the flame fronts. It was seen that before t = 6.3 ms,
the hot flame and cool flame were coupled and propagated at a
speed of ∼15.3 cm/s. At 6.3 ms, the cool flame front started to de-
couple from the hot flame and began propagating at a much faster
speed  of  ∼27.5 cm/s.  At  10 ms,  LTI  occurred  in  front  of  the  cool
flame, which resulted in a single (autoignition-assisted) propagat-

2 O and other intermediate species. The double flame
oxidized to CH
on the unstable branch was seen to begin in a similar manner to
the cool flame but reached a second stage of oxidation near the
edge of the domain. Changing the domain size did not affect the
extinction turning point of the hot flame but significantly modi-
fied the ignition turning point of the cool flame [20] . Pan et al.
[188] also noted the sensitivity of the double flame to the domain
size.

The  most  important  finding  in  the  work  of  Ju  et  al.  [20]  is
that, unlike the results at atmospheric pressure ( Fig. 23 ), the lean
cool flame transitions to a hot flame via a warm flame at pres-
sures above 5 atm for DME/air mixtures without any ignition and
extinction  turning  point.  As  seen  in  Fig.  25 a,  at  a  low  pressure
(i.e., 2 atm), with the increase of equivalence ratio, the lean cool
flame transitions to a hot flame at its ignition limit ( E ). However,
at 4 atm, the cool flame ignition limit has fallen to (cid:3) = 0.43, which
is close to the flammability limit of the hot flame ( A ) ( (cid:3) = 0.30).
As the pressure is increased further to 20 atm, the cool flame ig-
nition limit merges with the lean flammability limit of hot flame
( A ),  leading  to  a  direct  transition  from  cool  flame  to  hot  flame

without an extinction limit (similar to the hot flame to warm and
cool flame transition on the fuel-rich flame branch CD). A flame
structure analysis shows that, at high pressures, the transition from
cool flame to hot flame passes through the two-stage warm flame
structure  consisting  of  a  leading  cool  flame  front  at  x = 0.1 cm
and a trailing intermediate temperature flame front at x = 0.3 cm
( Fig.  25 b).  This  finding  implies  that,  near  the  lean  flammability
limit of the hot flame, the warm flame (similar to the blue flame
observed in fuel-rich mixtures by Townend et al. [74] ) is a bridge
connecting the cool flame and hot flame at high pressure.

To  understand  how  the  increase  in  pressure  can  transfer  the
cool  flame  into  a  two-stage  warm  flame  and  to  demonstrate
the  similarity  in  flame  structure  of  lean  and  rich  warm  flames,
the  spatial  distributions  of  chemical  heat  release  rate  and  con-
ductive  heat  flux  of  the  lean  and  rich  cool  flame  structures  of
DME/air at 20 atm are plotted, respectively, in Fig. 26 a and b. Un-
like the lean cool flame at 2 atm ( Fig. 24 a), the lean cool flame at
20 atm has a two-stage warm flame structure, in which the chem-
ical heat release rate of the leading cool flame is higher than that
2 O
of the trailing warm flame. The formation of H
2 O in
the  leading  cool  flame  and  the  oxidation  of  CH
2 O  to  CO  in  the
trailing warm flame confirm that the two-stage warm flame struc-
ture is governed by both the low-temperature and intermediate-
temperature chain-branching pathways ( Tables 3 and 4 ). Similarly,

2  and CH

the high-pressure rich warm flame (blue flame) ( Fig. 26 b) is also
a two-stage flame. This result confirms the experimental results of
rich premixed flames presented in Figs. 13-16 . Note that the sep-
aration distance between the leading cool flame and the trailing
blue flame, δ
c,h , at this condition is ∼0.5 mm for the lean case. As
will be discussed later, such a large flame separation distance can
strongly enhance turbulence-chemistry interaction.

To  summarize  the  flame  regimes  and  burning  limits  of  pre-
mixed cool, warm, and hot flames in Figs. 23 and 25 , a K-shaped
flammability limit diagram with four different flammable regions is
shown in Fig. 27 . AB and DE in Fig. 27 denote, respectively, the lean
burn limits of cool flame and hot flame. It is seen that the lean
flammability limits of cool flames or warm flames ( DE ) are much
lower than those of hot flames ( AB ). Therefore, lean cool flames ex-
tend the flammability limit of hot flames. As also shown in Fig. 27 ,
the cool flame ignition limit ( AC ) is strongly dependent on the op-
erating pressure. As the pressure increases, the cool flame ignition
limit shifts to a lower equivalence ratio. At a critical equivalence
ratio ( A ), the cool flame ignition limit merges with the flammabil-
ity limit of the hot flame, above which the flammability limit of
hot flame does not exist due to the emergence of the warm flame.
In the region between AC and AB , both cool flames and hot flames
can exist at identical conditions. Therefore, Fig. 27 illustrates four
different  flammable  regions,  I:  hot  flame,  II,  hot  flame  and  cool

sured.  Cool  flame  temperatures  were  also  measured  by  thermo-
couples, with the maximum temperatures decreasing from 885 K
at (cid:3) = 0.4 to 779 K at (cid:3) = 1.4. Therefore, the Hencken burner is a
creative way of measuring the laminar flame speed of cool flames
while  avoiding  the  pre-ignition  events  at  elevated  temperatures
that plague static systems. However, this experimental approach is
limited to low-pressure cool flames and requires sensitization by
active species (e.g., ozone).

3.4. Counterflow premixed cool flames

Premixed  counterflow  flames  provide  a  well-defined,  nearly
one-dimensional configuration to study cool flame structure, dy-
namics,  and  chemistry  under  the  effects  of  stretch.  Studies  of
stretched  premixed  counterflow  cool  flames  were  conducted  by
Reuter et al. [97] and Zhao et al. [190] . Both experiments were per-
formed at atmospheric pressure conditions using DME as the fuel.
Fig. 31 presents a schematic representation of the experimental
setup of Reuter et al. [97] . The burner setup was described in de-
tail in [16] and [191] . Here only a brief description is provided. The
upper burner nozzle issued pure nitrogen heated to 600 K to trig-
ger ozone decomposition (which occurs around 450 K) and estab-
lish the cool flame. The oxidizer stream initially consisted of pure
oxygen at 300 K, which passed through a non-equilibrium plasma
ozone generator before exiting through the lower burner nozzle.
For the range of oxygen flow rates in [97] , the ozone concentration
in the oxidizer remained between 3.0–3.4%. The strain rate ( a ) was
defined as the density-weighted gradient of the axial flow veloci-
ties on the oxidizer side [192] , specifically,

hot flame at identical conditions of (cid:3) = 0.114 and a = 89 s −1  are
shown in Fig. 31 a and b. The cool flame was observed to be vis-
ibly dimmer than the hot flame. Furthermore, the hot flame had
a higher flame speed. As a result, it moved closer to the bottom
burner exit. Fig. 31 c and Fig. 31 d show the CH
2 O PLIF images cor-
responding to Fig. 31 a and b, respectively. The cool flame had a
very thick region of CH
2 O in
the hot flame had a lower intensity and was limited only to the
thin preheat zone in front of the high-temperature reaction zone.
It should be noted that ozone was necessary to stabilize premixed
DME cool flames at a premixture temperature of 300 K for ultra-
lean mixtures.

In the counterflow configuration, if one raises the temperature
2  issued  from  the  upper  burner,  a  premixed  cool
of  the  inert  N
flame can be sustained without ozone. Zhao et al. [190] showed
that DME/O
2  premixed cool flames (red arrows in Fig. 32 ) were
formed between (cid:3) = 0.8 and (cid:3) = 1.8 when the nitrogen tempera-
ture was raised to 686 K. Since 686 K is close to the autoignition
2  mixture  at  atmospheric
temperature  of  a  stoichiometric  DME/O
pressure,  the  observed  cool  flame  may  have  been  supported  by
a temperature gradient. The insensitivity of the cool flame posi-
tion and structure to a wide range of (cid:3) further suggests that the
cool flames detected in [190] may have been in the autoignition-
assisted flame regime. More experimental studies are needed un-
der these conditions to provide further insight into the role of au-
toignition on flame stabilization.

To examine the transitions between hot flames and cool flames
under the influence of stretch, Reuter et al. [97] simulated the de-
pendence of flame temperature on strain rate for three different

Since fuel and air mixtures are often diluted by EGR to reduce
emissions and improve efficiency in practical engine applications,
Ju  [20]  also  studied  the  impact  of  mixture  dilution  on  the  cool
2 ). Fig. 28 shows
flame dynamics for DME/air and DME/(0.1O
that the propagation speeds and flame temperatures of both hot
and cool flames were reduced by nitrogen dilution. Nevertheless,
the impact of dilution on the hot flame speed was much larger
than on the cool flame speed and resulted in a broader flammable
region of cool flames. Therefore, mixture dilution can suppress hot
flames and promote cool flame burn. It should be noted that the
N
2 dilution effect studied here only represents the thermal and di-
lution effect of EGR. In real EGR, there are additional chemical ki-
2 O, and NO x chemistry and their effec-
netic effects through CO
tiveness as third-body colliders.

An  experimental  study  of  weakly  stretched  one-dimensional
premixed  DME  cool  flames  was  performed  by  Hajilou  et  al.
[131] using a laminar flat flame Hencken burner [189] at low pres-
sure  (7.3 kpa)  with  ozone  sensitization  ( Fig.  29 a).  In  a  Hencken
burner,  the  fuel  and  oxidizer  diffusively  mix  at  the  exit  of  the
microtubes of the burner nozzle ( Fig. 29 b). Since mixing is slow
at  atmospheric  pressure,  incomplete  mixing  causes  wrinkling  in
the flame front, especially at higher flow rates. However, at low
enough  pressures,  mixing  can  be  fast  enough  to  create  a  pre-
mixed flat flame with low stretch and curvature [189] . As shown
in Fig. 29 c, with the increase of flow rate at low pressure (7.3 kpa),
two  distinct  cool  flame  stabilization  modes  were  observed:  a
burner-stabilized mode at low flow rates and a freely-propagating
mode at higher flow rates [131] .

Fig.  30  shows  the  sequence  of  images  of  DME  cool  flames
at (cid:3) = 0.6 over a range of flow rates, 0.59–1.56 SLPM. By deter-
mining the  flow  rate  at  the  transition between  these  two  flame
modes  (burner-stabilized  versus  freely-propagating),  the  laminar
cool flame speeds from (cid:3) = 0.4 to (cid:3) = 1.4 were successfully mea-

tinction and ignition transition between hot flames and cool flames
for atmospheric premixed flames was confirmed by experimental
observations [97] .

To examine the near-limit flame dynamics in greater detail, a
flame  extinction  experiment  [120]  was  conducted  by  decreasing
the mixture equivalence ratio continuously from a hot flame to a
cool flame. At t = 0 s, a hot flame was self-sustained at (cid:3) = 0.102
( Fig. 34 a). As the equivalence ratio approached (cid:3) ≈ 0.09, the hot
flame receded from the bottom burner to the flow stagnation plane
(due to the lower flame speed) and a new cool flame appeared in
front of the hot flame, forming a double flame structure ( Fig. 34 b).
When the fuel concentration was further reduced below the hot
flammability limit, the hot flame extinguished and only the lead-
ing cool flame remained ( Fig. 34 c). The observation of this near-
limit double flame confirmed the numerical predictions of a double
flame structure shown in Fig. 22 for a lean n -heptane/air mixture
[26] and for a lean DME/air mixtures [20,185] . Note that the double
flame is different from the warm flame. The former is a two-stage
LTC-HTC structure and can exist only within the hot flame flamma-
bility limit. The latter is a two-stage LTC-ITC structure which usu-
ally exists outside of the hot flame flammability limit. Future ex-
perimental studies need to be conducted at elevated pressures to
see if the warm flame transition occurs ( Fig. 27 ).

Reuter  et  al.  [194]  further  examined  stable  near-limit  double
flames  in  the  counterflow  configuration ( Fig.  34 d).  In  a  counter-
flow flame, there is significant heat and radical loss due to the fi-
nite flow residence time. This allows the cool flame to propagate
faster  than  the  near-limit  hot  flame.  Therefore,  heat  and  radical
loss from the reaction zone can stabilize the double flame indef-
initely.  The  existence  of  stable  double  flames  for  near-limit  rich
mixtures ( (cid:3) = 2.5) in the counterflow geometry has also been con-
firmed by numerical simulations [195] .

equivalence ratios ( Fig. 33 ). The upper branch represented the hot
flame  branch,  bounded  by  the  HFE  limit,  beyond  which  the  hot
flame will extinguish. The lower branch between the HTI limit (the
point where the cool flame ignited to a hot flame) and the CFE
limit was the stable region of the cool flame. Therefore, both stable
cool flames and stable hot flames were simulated for a wide range
of  strain  rates  and  equivalence  ratios.  These  calculations  agreed
with the experimental observations (for the (cid:3) = 0.114 condition)
in Fig. 31 a and b.

Also evident in [97] was that a strained cool flame can remain
burning  beyond  the  extinction  limit  of  a  hot  flame.  It  was  seen
in Fig. 33 that as the equivalence ratio is lowered, the CFE limit
decreased  at  a  much  slower  rate  than  the  HFE  limit  because  of
its lower temperature sensitivity. At ultra-lean equivalence ratios
( (cid:3) = 0.080 and (cid:3) = 0.095) , the CFE limit even extended beyond the
HFE limit. In these cases, the hot flame extinguished and transi-
tioned directly to a cool flame. This result supported the conclu-
sion of numerical modeling [185] that a lean cool flame can po-
tentially exist beyond the HFE limit. Moreover, the hysteresis of ex-

In  summary,  self-sustaining  premixed  cool  flames  have  been
successfully established in a counterflow burner. The experimental
finding of the two-stage double flame for near-limit mixtures has
confirmed the computational prediction of the existence of steady
double flames. Additionally, since decreases in equivalence ratio af-
fect hot flames much more than cool flames, the two-stage double
flame exists slightly above the extinction limit of the hot flame in
cases where the CFE limit exceeded the HFE limit. Finally, the tran-
sitions between the hot flame and cool flame at near-limit condi-
tions can be hysteretic.

4. Nonpremixed cool flames

In  the  last  decade,  major  advances  have  been  made  in  the
study of nonpremixed cool flames. In 2012, cool flames in droplet
combustion were discovered during Flame Extinguishment (FLEX)
experiments [15] onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Ter-
restrial nonpremixed cool flames were also observed in counter-
flow flames by using plasma, ozone, or heated air [16,17,96,196] .
Since  that  time,  nonpremixed  cool  flame  studies  have  been  ex-
tended to different fuels, temperatures, and pressures. In this sec-
tion, we will first review the kinetic and radiative extinction lim-
its of nonpremixed flames. Then, the recent progress in cool flame
modeling and experiments in microgravity droplet combustion and
terrestrial  nonpremixed  counterflow  flames  will  be  summarized.
Attention is placed on the transitions between hot flames and cool
flames,  the  cool  flame  burning  limit,  and  the  newly  discovered
two-stage warm flame [18,19,21] . Moreover, the effects of reactant
temperature, pressure, and thermal radiation on the burning limits
of different flame regimes will be reviewed.

Da =

To understand the dynamics of nonpremixed cool flames, it is
necessary to understand the regimes and burning limits of non-
premixed hot flames. Fendell [197] and Liñán [198] developed the
thermal ignition and extinction theory of adiabatic nonpremixed
flames.  The  influences  of  thermal  and  kinetic  loss  mechanisms
were later incorporated (e.g., radiative losses in [199] ). The non-
premixed flame regimes and extinction limits are governed by the
Damköhler number, Da , defined as
Flow residence time ( t res )

Chemical reaction time ( t

chem )
With the decrease of Da , the chemical time scales become too
long  (relative  to  the  flow  residence  time)  for  combustion  to  be
completed. Hence, a departure of the flame temperature from the
adiabatic flame temperature occurs in addition to an increase of
fuel and oxidizer leakage across the reaction zone. If Da decreases
below a critical value, the flame temperature becomes so low that
the exothermic reaction process is rapidly reduced and flame ex-
tinction occurs abruptly. The degree of nonlinearity of the kinetic
source term (and hence the bifurcative behavior of the flame) is
best represented by an appropriate Zel’dovich number.

(2)

In  droplet  combustion  [200] ,  the  maximum  dissipation,  and
therefore the eventual extinction, can be governed by either the
diffusive or radiative time scales. Unlike premixed flames, where
the flame thickness is effectively a mixture property (due to the
necessity of kinematic balance), the nonpremixed flame thickness
is  a  function  of  both  the  mixture  properties  and  the  character-
istic flow residence time. For sufficiently small droplet diameters
(and hence low residence times), the dissipation time scales are
dictated by diffusive losses, since the diffusive time scale is pro-
portional to the square of the flame diameter. As the droplet size
and flame size decrease as burning progresses, the reactant diffu-
sive timescale decreases, leading to a decrease in Da , and flame ex-
tinction can occur. This extinction at low Da sometimes is referred
to as “diffusive extinction” in droplet combustion. Conversely, for
sufficiently large droplet diameters, the dissipation time scales are

dictated by radiative loss, since the volumetric radiative loss time
is inversely proportional to the cube of the flame diameter. Exces-
sively large radiative heat loss can cause “radiative extinction” of
the flame [186,201,202] . Note that if Da is expressed in terms of
flow residence time and a fixed chemical time scale (e.g., at adia-
batic conditions), then radiative extinction occurs at large values of
Da . Illustrations of the two extinction modes are shown in Fig. 35 .

4.1. Cool flames in droplet combustion

From the discussion above, it is apparent that the flame tem-
perature and extinction limits in droplet combustion are controlled
by a combination of diffusion, conduction, radiative heat transfer,
and fuel chemistry [204,205] . In 1995, two-stage droplet ignition
was studied by Tanabe et al. [206] both experimentally and com-
putationally. The results showed that there was a two-stage tem-
perature rise and an NTC region for the ignition of the partially
premixed gas-phase reactants. Furthermore, due to the NTC effect,
the results showed that the ignition location was sensitive to the
environment  temperature.  In  2005,  Cuoci  et  al.  [207]  conducted
simulations on the ignition of n -heptane droplets. The autoignition
and droplet burning was simulated using a detailed kinetic scheme
that included the major chain-branching pathways at low and high
temperatures.  The  influence  of  the  initial  diameter,  environment
temperature, radiative heat losses, and low-temperature oxidation
on droplet burning rates was investigated. Fig. 36 a shows the time
histories of flame diameter with different reduced thermal conduc-
tivity of the gaseous mixture. It was seen that, with the reduction
of the thermal conductivity, the quasi-steady flame diameter de-
creased. Furthermore, the results ( Fig. 36 b) also revealed that the
hot flame can radiatively extinguish into a cool flame.

In  2012,  significant  progress  in  cool  flame  studies  in  droplet
combustion was made during the microgravity experiments con-
ducted onboard the ISS as a part of the FLEX program [15] . Dur-
ing experiments initially performed to study the high-temperature
burning  of  liquid  fuel  droplets,  it  was  observed  that  large
n -heptane  droplets  can  exhibit  dual  modes  of  combustion.  The
dual modes were subsequently attributed to the high-temperature
(hot  flame)  and  low-temperature  (cool  flame)  burning  modes.
Fig. 37 shows the square of the droplet diameter and the flame di-
ameter, plotted as functions of time, for three typical free-floating
droplet  burning  conditions.  Following  the  hot  flame  ignition  (at
t = 0 s), the classical result of quasi-linear time variation of square
of the droplet diameter (right axis of Fig. 37 ) was observed. After
6–10 s, the hot flame luminescence decreased dramatically (lower
than the detectable threshold of the optical setup), indicating the
extinction of the hot flame (left axis of Fig. 37 ). Surprisingly, the
rate of droplet regression was unchanged for much longer dura-
tions (until 35, 26, or 13 s, depending on the initial droplet size)

ments  [210] .  It  is  important  to  realize  that,  prior  to  the  ISS  ex-
periments,  cool  flames  in  premixtures  were  known  to  exist  and
their properties reasonably well documented, but it was unclear
whether it was possible for cool flames to sustain a purely non-
premixed burning mode.

Detailed  numerical  simulations  of  droplet  cool  flame  burning
were  conducted  by  Farouk  and  co-authors  [211-215]  for alkanes
and PRFs. The role of cool flame chemistry on droplet cool flame
formation, oscillatory cool flame reignition, and single-stage igni-
tion to cool flame transition were studied. Fig. 38 shows the pre-
dicted  n -heptane  droplet  diameter,  burning  rate,  flame  diameter
and  peak  gas  temperature  evolution  using  two  different  chemi-
cal  kinetic  models,  a  detailed  low-temperature/high-temperature
model [104] and a high-temperature model [216] , along with the
experimental  data  [211] .  The  predictions  from  the  two  kinetic
models were distinctively different, confirming the role of LTC in
sustaining a cool flame burning mode. It was further demonstrated
that,  while  the  hot  flame  burning  rate  can  be  reasonably  pre-
dicted using state-of-the-art chemical models, significant discrep-
ancies  (within  a  factor  of  3.5)  between  the  measured  and  com-
puted CFE diameters were found. This suggested deficiencies in the
kinetics, thermodynamics, or transport coefficients in the model,
even for an extensively studied PRF such as n -heptane.

Furthermore,  additional  tested  were  conducted  for  n -octane,
n -decane [107] , and bi-component droplets of decane and hexanol
(50/50 by volume) for ambient pressures as high as 3 atm [217] .
The results revealed that, at some conditions, the transition from
radiative  extinction  of  the  hot  flame  to  the  cool  flame  occurred
through oscillatory cycles where the flame went through multiple
hot flame-cool flame transitions [212] . Additionally, depending on
the ignition energy [214,218] , a cool flame could be ignited directly
without  requiring  radiative  extinction  of  the  hot  flame.  Fig.  39
shows this occurring for an ignition energy of 0.7 j. The predicted
droplet diameter evolution during the initiation phase was also in
good agreement with the experimental measurements.

Farouk  et  al.  [212]  reported  the  onset  of  oscillatory  combus-
tion modes, in which multiple cycles of hot flame reignition fol-
lowed  by  the  transition  to  cool  flame  burning  (FLEX  480).  Both
experimental  observation  and  numerical  modeling  of  the  multi-
cycle,  multi-stage  transition  behavior  of  n -heptane  droplet  com-
bustion are shown in Fig. 40 . The model successfully captured the

and the square of the droplet radius (d 2
) as a function of time. Vertical solid lines

hot-flame stage (top), a backlit droplet image during the second stage (middle), and

sition point (Reprinted from [15] with permission of Elsevier).

Afterwards, there was a transition point after which the regression
rate decreased and the droplet vaporization slowed down rapidly
(the vertical dotted lines in Fig. 37 ). Since such anomalies could
not be accounted for by vaporization alone, it was eventually sug-
gested that the droplet continued to burn in a cool flame mode af-
ter radiative extinction of the hot flame. This conclusion was sup-
ported by the existence of a fuel vapor cloud that invariably began
to grow due to the large fuel leakage from the cool flame.

With  the  suggestion  that  cool  flames  were  present  during
droplet burning under certain conditions, similar experiments were
then performed with increased optical sensitivity, and the occur-
rence  of  cool  flames  was  confirmed  using  radiometer  measure-

qualitative dynamic behavior of the multi-cycle, two-stage burning
( Fig. 40 b). Similar thermo-kinetic instabilities were also observed
in nonpremixed counterflow cool flames [219] and submillimeter
sized n -alkane droplets [220] .

On the basis of the prior discussion on reaction kinetics, the
balance of heat release and the NTC kinetics determines whether
reactions  accelerate  into  reignition  of  a  hot  flame  event,  burn
quasi-steadily  in  the  cool  flame  mode,  or  diffusively  extinguish
completely. Near the crossover temperature, perturbations of the
local HRR result in a proportional perturbation in the flame tem-
perature (e.g., a temperature rise). However, this temperature rise
results  in  a  decrease  in  reactivity  (e.g.,  radical  pool)  due  to  the
NTC effect. The decrease in reactivity results in a subsequent de-
crease in the HRR and hence the flame temperature. The reduc-
tion of the flame temperature in the vicinity of the NTC crossover
temperature then results in an increase in the reactivity. The in-
creased  reactivity  then  increases  the  local  HRR,  and  so  on.  That
is,  the  manifestation  of  thermo-kinetic  instability  in  cool  flames

is  simply  the  kinetic  amplification  of  perturbations  in  the  HRR.
Note  that  the  thermo-kinetic  instability  of  NTC-affected  burning
is well known for closed stirred and unstirred reactors [4] and is
thought to be the same mechanism governing the aforementioned
[212,219,220] instabilities in flames.

There  have  also  been  some  recent  advances  in  the  theory
of  cool  flame  structure  and  dynamics  [221-223]  with  regards  to
droplet burning experiments. Seshadri et al. [223] outlined a sim-
plified  description  of  low-temperature  NTC  chemistry,  beginning
with  a  skeletal  chemical  mechanism  (for  n -heptane)  and  invok-
ing systematic use of the quasi-steady state approximation. A key
physical  insight  was  the  realization  that  the  cool  flame  is  only
stable near the crossover temperature, where the production and
consumption  of  OQ’OOH  is  approximately  equal.  Therefore,  con-
servation  equations  for  energy  and  OQ’OOH  were  then  obtained
and solved by activation energy asymptotics. By directly invoking
Liñán’s partial-burning regime model [198] , analytical expressions

extinction were obtained. The simplified model was able to predict
the measured values of droplet extinction diameters qualitatively.
Williams  et  al.  [224]  recently  upgraded  this  simplified model  to
capture the effects of pressure and expected that the use of re-
duced yet quantitatively accurate kinetics (e.g., [149] ) would fur-
ther aid agreement with measurements.

Recent experiments of the cool flame burning of large droplets
at  elevated  pressures  [217]  have  revealed  previously  unobserved
and anomalous CFE and cool flame reignition phenomena. While
the burning rate of the hot flame was observed to increase with
increasing pressure, the excited OH chemiluminescence and color-
camera luminosity decreased. However, this decrease was only de-
tected in the case of the larger droplets, which amounted to larger
residence time of the reactants across the flame front. Moreover,
prior to radiative extinction, the hot flame became nearly invisible
and a cool flame appeared immediately upon what was thought
to be radiative extinction. Indeed, these observations suggest that
a  different  flame  chemistry  may  dominate  the  droplet  burning
at  such  conditions,  especially  at  higher  residence  times.  Unfor-
tunately,  due  to  the  limited  test  conditions  and  optical  diagnos-
tics, this anomalous burning behavior could not be adequately ex-
plained at the time.

These results motivated the latest investigations in micrograv-
ity  droplet  combustion.  Farouk  et  al.  [19]  simulated  the  pres-
ence of near-limit quasi-steady, three-stage burning behavior—cool
flame,  warm  flame,  and  hot  flame—of  large  n -alkane  droplets.

radiatively  extinguished  into  a  warm  flame  burning  mode  at  a
moderate  maximum  reaction  zone  temperature  ( ∼970 K),  which
was  followed  by  a  transition  to  a  lower  temperature  ( ∼765 K)
cool  flame  burning  mode.  This  contrasts  previous  observations
[15,212,225] ,  which  only  saw  two  burning  modes.  It  is  apparent
from the FSR evolution history that each of the flame regime tran-
sitions is associated with a contraction of the flame (reduction in
FSR).  However,  despite  the  large  variation  in  the  flame  regime,
there are no distinctive changes in the predicted time history of
the droplet diameter regression.

diluted with helium are shown in Fig. 42 . Similar to the computed
n -heptane  results  discussed  above,  a  transient  three-stage  (hot
flame, warm flame, and cool flame) burning behavior was clearly
observed. The computational and experimental results showed that
the heat transfer, enhanced by helium substitution, extended the
second-stage  warm  flame  burning  mode  until  the  heat  loss  be-
comes too large.

In  summary,  microgravity  droplet  combustion  studies  aboard
the  ISS  have  revealed  the  possibility  of  cool  flames  in  a  non-
premixed system. The nonpremixed cool flame was determined to
be an entirely different mode of burning than the hot flame and
was found to be accessible either from the radiative extinction of
the hot flame or  by direct ignition. These two  modes can oscil-
late between each other in an extinction-reignition process, consis-
tent with previous studies of premixed cool flames. Finally, a third
burning mode, the warm flame, was also discovered to lie between
the cool flame and the hot flame. The microgravity droplet plat-
form has led to new insights into the relationship between cool
flames and hot flames, and further microgravity droplet studies of
cool flames and warm flames are warranted.

4.2. Counterflow nonpremixed cool flames

In parallel with the cool flames studies in microgravity droplet
combustion in space, steady nonpremixed cool flames have been
established in the counterflow configuration. The counterflow plat-
form offers a method to study the cool flame structure and dynam-
ics under the effects of stretch quantitatively with easy access to
diagnostics. The main advancements have included the identifica-
tion of the role of NTC kinetics on nonpremixed flame ignition, the
establishment of self-sustaining nonpremixed cool flames, and in-
vestigations into the structure and dynamics of steady cool flames.
More recently, a new two-stage nonpremixed warm flame was also
discovered. In the following section, the highlights of the research
progress in nonpremixed counterflow cool flames will be reviewed.
Early  studies  on  nonpremixed  counterflow  cool  flames  began
with the examination of the role of NTC kinetics on nonpremixed
ignition. In 2004, Liu et al. [226] numerically investigated the effect
of strain rate on nonpremixed n -heptane unsteady ignition in the
counterflow  geometry  at  elevated  pressures.  The  results  showed
that,  for  low  to  moderate  strain  rates,  the  ignition  behaviors  in
counterflow flames were comparable to those in homogeneous sys-
tems, including the NTC regime. However, at high strain rates, dif-
fusive losses inhibited ignition. In 2012, Law and Zhao [227] com-
putationally studied the NTC effect on the ignition and extinction

of n -heptane/air in the nonpremixed counterflow configuration. As
shown in Fig. 43 , at 1 atm, it was found that the NTC effect re-
sulted in the occurrence of multiple bifurcations and hence mul-
tiple  steady  flames.  In  addition  to  the  classical  hot  flame  solu-
tion arising from high-temperature kinetics (i.e., hydrogen/oxygen
chain-branching),  a  second  possible  steady  solution  arose  when
the residence time was long enough to allow for sustained low-
temperature chain-branching. The results also showed that the oc-
currence of NTC-affected ignition and extinction was facilitated by
increased system pressure (the bottom right plot in Fig. 43 ).

Zhao and Law [228] further computationally studied the criti-
cal strain rate of NTC-affected ignition at various pressures. Fig. 44
shows the effects of NTC on the ignition S-curve and the bound-
ary between NTC- and non-NTC-affected ignition. The ignition S-
curve was folded at low strain rates and possessed an additional
cool flame branch. Moreover, the critical strain rate increased with
higher pressures due to the NTC chemistry becoming more promi-
nent. More importantly, depending on the mixture and the bound-
ary conditions, the cool flame branch could be stable or unstable,
depending primarily on HRR.

Motivated  by  plasma-enhanced  low-temperature  reactivity,  Ju
et al. experimentally studied the effect of non-equilibrium plasma
on a low-pressure nonpremixed flame by using DME [96] and n -
heptane  in  a  counterflow  burner.  It  was  discovered  that,  due  to
the deposition of radicals and ionized species from the plasma into
the  mixture,  direct  ignition  into  a  nonpremixed  cool  flame  was
possible.  Fig.  45  shows  the  images  of  an  n -heptane/O
2 /He  non-
premixed cool flame and hot flame sustained by an in-situ nano-
second repetitive plasma discharge at 72 torr. It was seen that, for
O2 = 0.3),
the same fuel and oxygen mole fractions ( X
two different flame structures could exist. The cool flame was dim-
2 O ∗ emissions in a broad reaction zone, whereas
mer and had CH
the hot flame was brighter and had a narrower reaction zone. Note
that since LTC at low pressure (72 torr) is very slow, the cool flame
could only be sustained with the assistance of an in-situ plasma,
which  provided  active  O  and  OH  radicals  to  accelerate  the  low-
temperature chain-branching sequence and lead to cool flame for-
mation.

F = 0.1 and X

To  separate  the  low-temperature  fuel  oxidation  kinetics  from
the plasma kinetics, Won et al. [16] used ozone to enhance LTC and
successfully stabilized a n -heptane/O
3 nonpremixed cool flame
in a counterflow burner. Fig. 46 a and b show the comparison be-
tween a cool flame and a hot flame at the same boundary condi-
tions (7% n -heptane in nitrogen at a strain rate of 100 s −1 ). Ozone

counterflow.  Single-point  laser  Doppler  velocimetry  was  used  to
measure  the  local  strain  rate,  and  the  role  of  varying  strain  on
nonpremixed  flame  ignition  was  investigated.  The  findings  were
consistent  with  previous  computational  predictions  [227] .  With
the  successful  establishment of  self-sustaining nonpremixed  cool
flames in the counterflow and the understanding of cool flame ig-
nition and stability, cool flame studies have since been extended
to various alkanes and oxygenates [97,120-122,133] and to elevated
pressures [132] .

As mentioned previously, recent terrestrial counterflow inves-
tigations  have  been  performed  to  investigate  the  structure  and
dynamics  of  warm  flames.  The  warm  flames  established  in  the
counterflow are thought to be the same as those onboard the In-
ternational Space Station experiments, as their temperatures and
dynamics are consistent with the anomalous droplet burning be-
havior reported during the microgravity experiments (FLEX 1268).
Recent  computations  ( Fig.  48 )  of  nonpremixed  counterflow
flames have demonstrated the emergence of such behaviors, de-
pending  on  the  mixture  conditions,  ambient  pressure,  and  inlet
temperatures. While investigating non-adiabatic cool flames at el-
evated pressures, Lin et al. [229] found a stable intermediate tem-
perature flame branch (warm flame branch, CD and ID) between
the hot flame branch (AB and HB) and the cool flame branch (EF)
( Fig. 48 ). This warm flame branch has a stretch (convection) ex-
tinction limit at a high strain rates (D), after which it can transi-
tion to a cool flame (EF). On the other hand, the hot flame has a
radiative extinction limit at low strain rates (H). Radiative extinc-
tion of a hot flame can transition to a warm flame (ID), similar to
the microgravity droplet experiments in Fig. 42 .

From the extinction and ignition limits in Fig. 48 , one can plot a
€-shaped flammability limit diagram for all three nonpremixed hot,
warm, and cool flame regimes in Fig. 49 . The C-shaped BOH curve
represents the stretch and radiative extinction limits of hot non-
premixed flames (points B and H, respectively, in Fig. 48 ). The DD’
line in Fig. 49 represents the stretch extinction limit of the cool
flame. The FF’ line denotes the stretch extinction limit of the warm
flame. Therefore, Fig. 49 provides qualitative guidance for experi-
ments to observe different kinds of flame regimes. Note that with
the increases in pressure or oxidizer temperature, the flammable
regions  of  cool  and  warm  flames  will  shift  to  high  strain  rates
[229] .

Yehia  et  al.  [21]  subsequently  conducted  experiments  using
nonpremixed dibutyl ether/oxygen-ozone flames in a counterflow

local heating, for example) in the sense that the amount of radi-
cals introduced is decoupled from low-temperature peroxy chain-
branching sequence. Since ozone molecules begins to decompose
2  + O + M, O rad-
into O radicals at 450 K through O
ical  formation  accelerates  the  H-abstraction  reactions  from  fuel
molecules and shortens the LTC timescales.

Numerical calculations were also performed in [16] to investi-
gate  the  flame  S-curves  and  explain  the  existence  of  two  flame
regimes  (cool  and  hot)  at  identical  flow  conditions.  Fig.  47  de-
picts  the  calculated  variation  of  flame  temperature  ( T max )  as  a
function of the strain rate for steady-state n -heptane nonpremixed
f = 0.05  with  and  without  3%
flames  at  a  fuel  mole  fraction  of  X
ozone  addition  at  the  oxidizer  stream.  Regardless  of  ozone  ad-
dition,  numerical  calculations  revealed  the  presence  of  two  sta-
ble flame branches, a hot flame and a cool flame. The HFE lim-
its were quite close without and with ozone addition, but the CFE
limits were substantially extended from a = 46 s −1 without ozone
to a = 141 s −1  with ozone addition. In the case of the hot flame,
the ozone doping only marginally increased the HRR and the OH
and O radical concentrations. Whereas, owing to the characteristi-
cally lower HRR and radical concentrations in the cool flame (0.1-
10 ppm),  ozone  doping  by  the  same  amount  increased  the  cool
flame HRR and radical pool size by an order of magnitude. Thus,
Won et al. [16] proved that ozone addition was an effective way
to initiate nonpremixed cool flames by allowing direct access to
the cool flame branch without the need to first sustain a hot flame
and attempt to extinguish it. Reuter et al. [121] later reported that
a self-sustaining cool flame could be sustained even after remov-
ing the ozone, as long as the CFE limit of the ozone-less cool flame
was not exceeded.

Deng et al. [17] also conducted an experimental study on the
coupling of NTC chemistry and transport in DME/air mixtures and
the  associated  steady  low-temperature  burning  in  nonpremixed

flame regimes is also clear. Note that the hot flame is insensitive
to ozone doping due to its high HRR and radical pool concentra-
tions. However, the cool flame and warm flame are more sensitive

5. Cool flames in turbulent combustion

Almost incidents of cool flames during combustion in real de-
vices take place in turbulent environments at high pressures and
elevated  temperatures.  However,  challenges  in  using  optical  di-
agnostics in high-pressure, turbulent systems have made it diffi-
cult to understand turbulence-LTC interactions and the role of cool
flames in engines.

5.1. Cool flames in nonpremixed turbulent combustion

Combustion  in  diesel  engines  consists  of  a  turbulent  non-
premixed lifted flame stabilized primarily by autoignition, but the
details of the stabilization mechanism and overall ignition process
have eluded researchers until relatively recently. Studies of diesel
spray combustion [232,233] employing high-speed schlieren imag-
ing revealed that low-temperature heat release (and the associated
temperature rise) led to the local softening of gradients near the
spray in the schlieren image.

Skeen et al. [234] performed simultaneous high-speed schlieren
and CH
2 O PLIF imaging in a n -dodecane spray injected into a high-
pressure (60 bar) and high-temperature air environment. The im-
ages in Fig. 52 shows a time sequence of CH
2 O PLIF and schlieren
images  involving  both  LTI  and  HTI  events.  The  white  boundary

sentation of LTI. It was seen that CH
μs after start of injection (ASOI). At 190 μs ASOI, the CH
2 O sig-
nal appeared at the upper and lower lobes of the spray boundary.
There was also some softening of gradients in the schlieren im-
age at the same locations, indicating that the cool flame started
at  the  high-temperature  air/spray  interface.  At  240  μs  ASOI,  the
CH
2 O front and the softened schlieren front moved into the core of
the spray, indicating the cool flame (or LTI region) was propagat-
ing from leaner to richer mixtures. At 390 μs ASOI, HTI occurred
as indicated by the radially and axially expanding spray head. As
HTI  progressed,  the  CH
2 O  PLIF  signal  decayed.  Nevertheless,  the
presence of CH
2 O from 190 μs onward suggested that LTI played a
role in the determining the location of the high-temperature flame.
However, the details of the diesel spray ignition process were still
unresolved.

to ozone addition due to the addition of much-needed radicals at
low temperatures.

More  recently,  Yehia  et  al.  [18]  demonstrated  experimentally
that  two-stage  nonpremixed  warm  flames  are  also  possible  for
n -alkanes such as n -heptane, n -decane, and n -dodecane in an at-
mospheric  counterflow  burner.  Similar  to  dibutyl  ether,  the  sec-
ondary  intermediate  temperature  oxidation  stage  of  n -dodecane
warm flames is supported mainly through the oxidation of the in-
termediates produced in the cool flame reaction zone. Note that,
while the quantitative structure and dynamics of cool and warm
flames are inherently fuel-dependent, as discussed previously, fuels
with pronounced NTC chemistry are expected to have qualitatively
similar structure and dynamics [18,21] .

The  blue  flame  which  has  been  observed  in  fuel-rich
[74,155,158] and stoichiometric premixed flames [128,129,163] also
has a flame temperature between the cool flame and the hot flame.
Therefore,  from  standpoint  of  flame  chemistry  and  flame  struc-
ture, the blue flame and warm flame should belong to the same
category,  although  the  former  was  seen  earlier  in  fuel-rich  pre-
mixed flames and the latter was observed recently in nonpremixed
flames. For consistency with cool flames and hot flames (which can
also exhibit blue chemiluminescence), we would recommend refer-
ring to the blue flame in the future as the “warm flame.”

The above sections provide a comprehensive summary of the
fundamentals of counterflow nonpremixed cool flames, as well as
the current knowledge of warm flames. Specifically, we have re-

At 700 K, the flame had a classical tribrachial structure, as in-
dicated by the dashed contour of HRR. At 900 K, however, it was
found  that  the  flame  consisted  of  a  main  tribrachial  structure
and an additional upstream branch due to LTI and was therefore
termed a tetrabrachial flame. In the 70 0 and 90 0 K cases, the ini-
tiation  of  the  high  OH  region  is  centered  on  the  stoichiometric
mixture  fraction.  At  1100 K  and  1300 K,  two  upstream  branches
were observed in addition to the main tribrachial structure, one
due  to  LTI  and  the  other  due  to  HTI.  These  flames  were  thus
termed pentabrachial flames. At 1500 K, the low-temperature up-
stream branch was suppressed, and there was only one upstream
HTI branch. In the 1300 K and 1500 K cases, the initiation of the
high OH region was in regions of very lean mixture fractions, co-
incident with the high-temperature autoigniting upstream branch.
Similar simulations were also carried out later by Deng et al.
[236] for DME/air coflow flames at air temperatures between 700-
1100 K  with  constant  inlet  velocity.  A  multibrachial  flame  struc-
ture was observed near 800 K. The change from autoignition to a
tribrachial flame structure in the coflow geometry is summarized
in  Fig.  54 .  Therefore,  LTI  and  cool  flames  can  significantly  mod-
ify flame modes and change the classical understanding of non-
premixed flames.

Bansal et al. [237] conducted both two- and three-dimensional
DNS studies of autoignition phenomena in stratified DME/air tur-
bulent  mixtures.  This  work  examined  the  fundamental  aspects

40 atm  over  a  range  of  oxidizer  temperatures  and  inlet  veloci-
ties. Fig. 53 presents the change of flame structures in terms of

of turbulence-mixing-autoignition interactions in engine environ-
ments. In particular, the contributions of homogeneous autoigni-
tion, spontaneous ignition front propagation, and premixed defla-
gration towards the total heat release were quantified.

Krisman  and  co-authors  [99,238]  further  extended  low-
temperature  nonpremixed  combustion  modeling  to  a  2-D  turbu-
lent  mixing  layer  at  diesel  engine-relevant  conditions.  The  DNS
was performed at a pressure of 40 atmospheres with air at 900 K
and fuel (DME) at 400 K. As shown in Fig. 55 , LTC developed as
a  “spotty” first-stage  autoignition  in  lean  regions,  after  which  it
transitioned to a diffusively-supported cool flame and propagated
up the mixture fraction gradient towards richer regions. The cool
flame propagation speed was much faster than what could be at-
tributed  to  spatial  gradients  in  first-stage  ignition  delay  time  in

homogeneous reactors. Moreover, the cool flame caused a short-
ening of the second-stage ignition delay time compared to a ho-
mogeneous reactor, and the shortening became more pronounced
at richer mixtures.

The  ignition  process  in  diesel  engines  is  summarized  in
Fig. 56 from Dahms et al. [30] , which agrees with both the DNS
study performed by [99] ( Fig. 55 above) and the experiments con-
ducted  by  Skeen  et  al.  [234]  ( Fig.  52  above).  Similar  processes
(diffusively-supported  cool  flame  propagation  into  rich  mixtures
followed by second-stage ignition) were also observed in a para-
metric DNS study of diesel spray conditions [31] and a recent DNS
study of dual fuel ignition [239] .

The  main  conclusion  of  the  above  research  is  that  key  fea-
tures  of  the  ignition  process  in  CI  engines  cannot  be  captured
when turbulence-LTC interactions and cool flames are neglected.

Moreover, as the pressure increases, LTC effects become relatively
stronger  and  thus  more  important  under  the  conditions  of  ad-
vanced engines.

However,  few  well-defined  experimental  measurements  of
turbulence-LTC  interactions  and  turbulent  nonpremixed  cool
flames are available. Recently, Reuter et al. [240] was able to isolate
turbulent nonpremixed cool flames by using a Co-flow Axisymmet-
ric Reactor-Assisted Turbulent burner. It was found that weak tur-
bulence produced wrinkled cool flames, and pockets of unburned
reactants appeared in the vicinity of the cool flame. Additionally,
Novoselov et al. [241] conducted a 2-D DNS study of isolated tur-
bulent  nonpremixed  cool  flames  and  observed  that  cool  flames
can have both nonpremixed and premixed characteristics at low
Damköhler numbers. Further studies to understand turbulence-LTC
interactions in nonpremixed combustion are needed.

5.2. Cool flames in premixed turbulent combustion

When  the  LTI  timescale  is  close  to  the  flow  residence  time
( Table  1 ),  LTI  will  modify  the  temperature,  species,  and  mixture
properties  of  the  unburned  mixture  and  thus  affect  the  burning
properties of the subsequent hot flame. Therefore, flames that first
undergo LTI prior to the main flame front qualify as autoignition-
assisted flame propagation.

Won  et  al.  [242,243]  developed  a  Reactor-Assisted  Turbulent
Slot (RATS) burner to understand how LTI affected premixed tur-
bulent  flame  speeds,  flame  structures,  and  flame  regimes.  The
schematic of the RATS burner is shown in Fig. 57 . The burner was
an integration of a turbulent Bunsen burner with an upstream flow
reactor. It was capable of high inlet temperatures (40 0–70 0 K) and
large LTI Damköhler numbers:

Flowresidencetime ( t res )

(3)

As  such,  it  provided  the  experimental  capability  for  flame
studies  at  a  large  turbulent  Reynolds  number  with  controlled
low-temperature fuel reactivity. Additional details about the RATS
burner are available in [242] .

Won et al. [242] measured the dependence of the normalized
turbulent flame speed ( S T /S L ) on turbulence intensity ( Fig. 58 ) and
performed OH and CH
2 O PLIF ( Fig. 59 ) across a range of temper-
atures. The turbulent burning velocity was found to have two dif-
ferent regimes: (a) a chemically-frozen regime at lower initial re-
actor temperatures and (b) a LTI regime at a higher initial reactor
temperatures. The turbulent flame speeds in the LTI regime were
much higher than those in the chemically-frozen regime ( Fig. 58 ).
The OH and CH
2 O PLIF images ( Fig. 59 ) revealed the differences
in the turbulent flame structures of these two flame regimes. In
2 O was present
the chemically-frozen regime, a small layer of CH

in the preheat zone of the high-temperature flame front (demar-
cated by OH PLIF). However, for turbulent flames in the LTI regime,
a significant amount of CH
2 O was formed upstream of the high-
temperature  flame  front  via  LTC.  Therefore,  turbulent  flames  in
the LTI regime were found to have different thermodynamic and
transport  properties, leading  to  increased turbulent  flame  speed.
More  interestingly,  the  results  showed  that  the  turbulent  flame
speed could be continuously increased by raising the LTI Damköh-
ler number (dotted circles in Fig. 58 ), suggesting that the turbu-
lent burning velocity for fuels with LTC may not be uniquely de-
fined.  Thus,  turbulent  flames  in  the  LTI  regime  can  be  consid-
ered a type of autoignition-assisted flame propagation (specifically,
LTI-assisted flame propagation). To investigate further the impact
of LTC on turbulent flame propagation, Windom et al. [243] per-
formed a Damköhler scaling analysis, which indicated that the in-
crease in turbulent flame speed in the LTI regime originated from
an increase in laminar flame speed, a decrease in Lewis number,
and an increase in turbulence intensity due to the changes in mix-
ture composition and temperature from LTC.

Recently, Krisman et al. [244] studied the structure and propa-
gation of freely-propagating laminar flames under autoignitive con-
ditions, including LTI-assisted flames. Fig. 60 a shows the schematic
of the 1-D computational domain with length L x . U I was the inlet
flow velocity, and T I was the inlet flow temperature. The flame lo-
cation L
f  was defined as the location where the HRR reached its
maximum. Computations were conducted by gradually increasing
U I  until  the  flame  reached  blow-off.  A  reference  flame  speed  s R
was defined as the maximum value of dL
f / dU I . Constant pressure
was assumed; a similar study under constant volume conditions
was performed by Faghih et al. [245] . The dependence of the flame
location on the inlet flow velocity at different inlet flow tempera-
tures were analyzed to understand the flame regimes.

Fig. 60 b shows the flame regime diagram from Krisman et al.
[244] in temperature-velocity space. Regime A was designated the
burner-stabilized flame regime corresponding to low inlet flow ve-
locities. This regime was found for both autoignitive conditions and
normal flame conditions. The boundary of Regime A corresponded
f / dU I ( = s R ). Regime B (LTI-assisted flame
to the peak value of dL
propagation)  was  found  only  for  fuels  with  both  LTC  and  HTC.
Regime  B  was  bounded  by  the  first  and  second  peak  values  of
dL
f  / dU I  ( Fig. 60 c). In regime C (autoignition-assisted flame prop-
agation),  the  flame  location  was  downstream  of  significant  pre-
ignition chemistry, which modified the reactant stream ahead of
the reaction zone and promoted flame propagation. In regime D

(autoignition stabilization), no premixed flame structure existed—
the  reaction  zone  was  simply  an  autoignition  front.  The  transi-
tion from regime C to regime D was gradual. Blow-off occurred in
regime E. In summary, the laminar premixed flame regimes out-
lined  in  [244]  are  critical  for  understanding  turbulent  premixed
flames at high temperatures and with strong LTC.

Using the framework from Krisman et al. [244] , a DNS study
of a Ф = 0.7 n -heptane/air premixed turbulent cool flame was per-
formed by Savard et al. [246] at 1 atm and 650 K (the same con-
ditions as [242] ). The flame was initialized using an ignition front
due to the short first-stage ignition delay time compared to the
flame  characteristic  time.  Fig.  61 a  and  b  show  the  contours  of
CH
2 O mass fraction and fuel burning rate, respectively. The turbu-
lent cool flame was strongly distorted and produced large amounts
2 O.  Therefore,  the  turbulent  cool  flame  displayed  a  more
of  CH
highly distributed structure than expected for a flame in the thin
reaction zones regime of the Borghi diagram. This was explained
by the lack of a preheat zone in cool flames [246] .

Fig.  61 c  presents  the  normalized  turbulent  flame  speed  as  a
function of Karlovitz number for all the flames simulated. The par-
tially ignited mixture (PIM) exhibited a similar trend to the un-
burnt mixture (UM) for S T /S L . Consequently, Savard et al. [246] con-
cluded that turbulent flame speed increase for LTI-assisted flame
propagation  (PIM)  was  primarily  caused  by  the  higher  laminar
flame speed. Further studies of isolated turbulent premixed cool
flames, LTI-assisted turbulent flames, and near-limit turbulent hot
flames (turbulent double flames) are needed in the future.

6. Conclusions and future work

6.1. Summary of current findings

Over the last decade, with the growing interest in alternative
fuels and the design of advanced engines, cool flame research has
received  a  renewed  level  of  interest.  Various  cool  flame  experi-
ments have been conducted in micro heated reactors, microgravity
droplet combustion, nonpremixed counterflow burners, premixed
counterflow burners, and Hencken burners. A number of laminar
and turbulent computational studies have also been performed.

For  premixed  cool  flames,  the  vertical  tube  reactor  and
micro-reactor  experiments  have  provided  a  valuable  platform  to
understand  the  structures  of  cool  flames,  warm  flames  (blue
flames), and hot flames through reactor wall temperature control.
These experiments have successfully demonstrated the effects of

pressure, temperature, and fuel molecular structure on the chem-
istry  governing  these  different  regimes.  The  experimental  estab-
lishment  of  self-sustaining  premixed  cool  flames  in  counterflow
configurations and related computational studies have provided a
clearer picture regarding the conditions under which cool flames
can be observed terrestrially. These studies not only provided ex-
perimental  data  of  extinction  limits  for  kinetic  model  validation
but also have advanced the understanding of the transitions be-
tween cool flames and hot flames and the roles of different chain-
branching  chemistries  in  supporting  such  flames.  For  near-limit
premixed flames, it has been shown that a hot flame can poten-
tially transition into a double flame and then a cool flame, thereby
changing the flame structures and extending the flammability lim-
its.

Droplet combustion experiments onboard the ISS have observed
anomalous  behavior  during  the  radiative  extinction  of  a  high-
temperature flame in which the droplet continued to burn. These
unexpected results have been used as evidence to support the no-
tion  that  a  cool  flame  burning  mode  can  support  quasi-steady,
nonpremixed droplet combustion. Consistent with previous stud-
ies  of  premixed  cool  flames,  microgravity  studies  have  shown
that  droplet  flames  can  oscillate  between  a  hot  flame  burning
mode and a cool flame burning mode. The establishment of non-
premixed counterflow cool flames has also been reviewed for cases
both  with  and  without  ozone.  Furthermore,  nonpremixed  coun-
terflow  cool  flame  experiments  have  shown  deficiencies  in  low-
temperature chemical kinetic models, especially regarding the cou-
pling of low-temperature HRR and transport. Additionally, in both
microgravity droplet and counterflow configurations, nonpremixed
warm flames between the cool and hot flames have been observed.
In turbulent combustion, two-stage ignition and cool flames in
multi-dimensional laminar and turbulent flames have been mod-
eled by using DME, n -heptane, and other fuels with pronounced
LTC. The results have shown that two-stage ignition and cool flame
formation play a critical role in nonpremixed systems at elevated
temperatures  and  pressures.  Transition  from  LTI  to  a  cool  flame
propagating  from  leaner  to  richer  mixtures  has  been  observed
in  both  experiments  and  in  simulations.  For  premixed  turbulent
flames,  LTI-assisted  flame  propagation  has  been  shown  to  mod-
ify the mixture properties and result in increased turbulent flame
speed.

Overall, the recent progress in cool flame studies has revealed a
new dimension in combustion research owing to the unique flame
dynamics of the cool flame and its relevance to engine combustion.

6.2. Avenues in cool flame research

Despite the importance of cool flames and the progress made
over the last two centuries, many challenges and questions remain.
Many  practical  engines  experience  high  mixture  initial  tem-
peratures  (up  to  10 0 0 K)  and  pressures  (up  to  80 atm).  Further-
more,  the  combustion  processes  also  involve  high  levels  of  tur-
bulence  and  EGR.  Few  experiments  or  numerical  simulations
have been conducted to address the transitions between ignition,
autoignition-assisted  flame  propagation,  and  detonation/knock  at
elevated temperatures and pressures. The effects of EGR on cool
flames and two-stage ignition also deserve further study.

In  computational  studies,  many  assumptions  including  chem-
istry, thermodynamic properties, geometry, and computational do-
main are made. The influence of these assumptions on qualitative
and quantitative understanding needs to be emphasized or com-
pared with available experiments, especially at engine-related con-
ditions. Collaborative studies between numerical simulations and
experiments are encouraged to address these uncertainties.

In  spray  combustion,  spray  vaporization  dramatically  changes
the  distributions  of  temperature  and  fuel  concentration  and  re-

sults  in  coupled  temperature  and  concentration  gradients.  Al-
though recent microgravity studies provide improved understand-
ing  of  low-temperature  droplet  combustion  regimes  under  ideal
conditions, spray combustion experiments at engine operating con-
ditions  have  shown  qualitatively  different  transitions  from  LTI
to  high-temperature  flames.  More  experimental  studies  of  low-
temperature spray combustion are needed to understand the role
of cool flames in spray combustion at engine conditions.

In engines, there are often temperature gradients and fuel con-
centration  gradients  near  the  wall,  which  can  lead  to  knock  or
super-knock. Additionally, since cool flames are sensitive to radi-
cal and thermal quenching, studies of cool flame interaction with
catalytic and non-catalytic walls is also needed to understand the
formation and extinction of cool flames due to flame-wall interac-
tions.

The counterflow cool flame platform has potential as a conve-
nient tool for screening the low-temperature reactivity of alterna-
tive fuels. However, there are still open questions regarding the in-
fluence of LTI and cool flames in combustion engines. These ques-

ducted.

2 QOOH,  HO

Despite their critical role in low-temperature heat release, key
species  such  as  QOOH,  O
2 ,  and  OH  have  rarely  been
measured in cool flames. The development of advanced laser di-
agnostic  techniques  (e.g.,  Faraday  rotational  spectrometry)  and
advanced  sampling  methods  (e.g.,  photo-ionization  mass  spec-
trometry) to characterize these low-temperature flame species is
needed. Theoretical chemical kinetic calculations (quantum chem-
istry) are another viable method for determining reaction rates in-
volving difficult-to-measure species. These methods are crucial for
the  detailed  understanding  of  cool  flame  chemistry  and  for  the
development and validation of chemical kinetic models. Moreover,
the development of reduced order models that accurately capture
the  different  low-temperature  heat  release  pathways  are  needed
for practical computations.
