Parabolic  trough  collector  (PTC)  is  the  most  established  solar  concentrating  technology  worldwide.
The  conventional  parabolic  trough  collectors  are  used  in  various  applications  of  medium  and  high-
temperature levels. However, there are numerous studies which investigate alternative designs. The rea-
sons for examining different PTC configurations regard the thermal efficiency increase, the reduction of
the manufacturing cost and the development of more compact designs. The objective of this review pa-
per is to summarize the existing alternative designs of PTC and to suggest the future trends in this area.
Optical and thermal modifications are examined, as well as the use of concentrating thermal photovoltaic
collectors. The optical modifications include designs with secondary concentrators, stationary concentra-
tors and strategies for achieving uniform heat flux. The thermal modifications regard the use of nanoflu-
ids, turbulators and the use of thermally modified receivers with insulation, double-coating and radiation
shields. The concentrating thermal photovoltaics are systems with flat or triangular receivers which can
operate in low or in medium temperature levels with the proper alternative designs. It has been found
that there are many promising choices for designing PTC with higher thermal performance and lower
cost. The conclusions of this work can be used as guidelines for future trends in linear parabolic concen-
trating technologies.

1. Introduction

Solar energy utilization is a promising choice for facing numer-
ous problems in the energy domain such as the fossil fuel deple-
tion [1] , the global warming [2] , the increasing electricity demand
[3] and generally the nature pollution. Solar energy is practically
an abundant energy source with a huge potential [4] . The sun re-
leases extremely high amounts of solar irradiation [1] and approx-
imately the incident solar irradiation on the earth surface is about
1.7 × 10 14 kW [4] . This energy rate is tremendous because if it was
possible  to  utilize  this  amount  only  for  84  min  then  the  yearly
worldwide  energy  demand  would  be  fully  addressed  [4] .  More-
over, solar energy is a flexible energy source because it can be di-
rectly converted either to useful heat or to electricity [5] . Sun is
a radiation reservoir and this fact makes the solar energy a high-
potential energy source [6] . As a result, the solar irradiation can be
used in applications of a great temperature range and it is able to
compete with the combustion technologies in the cases of concen-
trating solar systems [7] . The previous facts indicate that solar en-
ergy presents numerous advantages and thus it is an ideal energy
source  for  covering  the  worldwide  energy  needs  in  a  renewable
and sustainable way.

Solar thermal collectors are devices which capture the solar en-
ergy and convert it into useful heat energy at different temperature
levels. On the other hand, photovoltaic cells are devices which cap-
ture the incident solar irradiation and produces directly electricity.
The solar thermal collectors are separated into flat and concentrat-
ing technologies. The flat technologies include the flat plate col-
lector and the evacuated tube collectors. The flat technologies are
used in low-temperature applications like space heating, domestic
hot water production and in solar cooling applications with single-
stage machines (absorption or adsorption). The maximum obtained
temperature levels are usually up to 90 °C with flat plate collectors
and up to 150 °C with evacuated tube collectors [8] .

The  concentrating  technologies  are  able  to  operate  at  higher
temperature levels and they are usually used in temperature lev-
els between 150–500 °C [9] . The parabolic trough collector (PTC)
is  the  most  mature  solar  concentrating  technology  at  this  mo-
ment  [10] .  Moreover,  the  linear  Fresnel  reflector  (LFR)  is  an  an-

tagonist of the PTC because both these collectors are linear con-
centrating technologies and they are usually used in the temper-
ature range of 20 0–40 0 °C. The PTC presents higher thermal effi-
ciency but the linear Fresnel collector tend to have lower specific
installation cost. More specifically, the PTC has a specific installa-
tion cost of 275 €/m 2 , while for the LFR it is estimated at 200 €/m 2
[11] . The optical efficiency of a PTC can reach up to 75%, while the
usual maximum limits of the LFR is about 65%. Other concentrat-
ing technologies are solar towers and solar dishes which are prac-
tically used only for high temperatures applications such as elec-
tricity production [12] .

The PTC can be used in a great range of applications for solar
cooling,  refrigeration,  industrial  heat,  desalination,  chemical  pro-
cesses and electricity production [13 , 14] . The PTC usually operate
with thermal oils as Syltherm 800, Therminol VP-1, Therminol 55,
Dowtherm A, etc. for operation up to 400 °C [15] . Moreover, PTC
can operate with water/steam for electricity production in Rank-
ine cycles. Furthermore, there are applications with molten salts
as work fluids and especially nitrate salts which can operate up to
550 ∼600 °C [15] .

A critical issue about the use of PTC and generally of solar ther-
mal systems is the storage issue. The solar irradiation is not a con-
tinuous energy source and this fact creates problems in the solar-
driven applications. Thus, the solar irradiation is usually hybridized
with  other  energy  souses  such  as  natural  gas  and  biomass  [16] .
Comparing the PTC with PV panels, it can be said that the PV pan-
els can produce electricity with a lower levelized cost of electric-
ity (LCOE). However, the produced electricity by the PV panels is
usually stored in batteries which face many limitations about their
high cost, their negative environmental impact and the restricted
lifetime (about 6–7 years) [17] . The alternative storage strategy is
the pumped hydroelectric storage but it is not always possible to
be done due to the restricted availability. On the other hand, the
use of solar thermal systems (e.g., PTC) can store energy in storage
tanks with thermal oils, molten salts and concrete which can be
cost-effective choices compared to the batteries.

Another competitive technology to the PTCs are the solar tow-
ers which operate with high concentrations ratios and so they can
be coupled to high-efficient power engines. Solar towers are high-

efficient solar systems with relatively low investment cost and this
is  the  reason  for  their  commercial  expansion  [18 , 19] .  The  solar
tower  power  plants  produce  high  power  amounts  and  this  fact
leads to huge installations. So, the solar towers can be installed in
locations with high area availability. On the other hand, the PTCs
can be separated into small modules and they can be adjusted to
any possible solar field, from a building roof up to a huge solar
farm. The thermal storage in the PTC solar fields is not so diffi-
cult because it can be done in temperature levels of 30 0 -- 40 0 °C
for example and not in extremely high temperatures that the solar
towers need (e.g., 700 °C or more). However, it is useful to state
that the PTC systems for steam generation face problems with the
energy storage. Furthermore, the PTCs are used in a great variety
of applications such as solar cooling, industrial heating, desalina-
tion and polygeneration systems, while the PV panels and the solar
towers are used only for power production.

In any case, the existing values of the levelized cost of electric-
ity with the PTC are about 0.20 €/kWh which is a not so attractive
value [20] . Thus, there is a need for a reduction in the investment
cost by increasing the thermal efficiency or reducing the manufac-
turing cost. It is expected that the levelized cost of the electricity
with the PTC will be reduced to 0.13 €/kWh up to 2020 [21] .

tube (the cover). Usually, there are vacuum conditions between the
absorber and the cover in order to eliminate the convection ther-
mal losses of the absorber. The vacuum is practically an extremely
low pressure of 0.013 Pa [23] . In order to keep the low-pressure,
getters are used to absorb the gas molecules. Fig. 1 b illustrates the
cross-section  of  an  evacuated  tube.  Usually,  the  outer  surface  of
the absorber has a selective coating in order to reduce the radia-
tion thermal losses to the environment. The Cermet coating is one
usual choice for the PTC. The emittance of the Luz Cermet coat-
ing is 0.061 at 25 °C, 0.146 at 400 °C and 0.179 at 500 °C, while the
absorbance is about 0.938 [24] .

The use of alternative and more flexible designs is an answer to
the problems of cost reduction, of designing light-weight systems
and of improving the environmental impact of the solar collector.
Moreover, alternative techniques for the performance enhancement
(both optical and thermal) are also the key-points for achieving the
reduced investment and operating cost. Furthermore, the operat-
ing of the PTC at higher temperature levels is an important goal
in order to couple the PTC with advanced and high efficient power
cycles. In this direction, this review paper summarizes the existing
alternative designs of the PTC in the literature. Optical and ther-
mal modifications are examined, as well as the combination of PTC
with photovoltaic cells ( PV ) is investigated. Fig. 1 briefly summa-
rizes the categories of the alternative PTC, as well the main goals
that can be achieved with the alternative designs. Practically, the
present study investigates three main classifications of the alter-
native PTC designs which are the optically modified systems, the
thermal modified systems and the concentrating thermal PV with
the parabolic trough. The results of this work can be used as guide-
lines for the future designs of PTC.

2. The conventional PTC

2.1. General description

The conventional PTC consists of a linear parabolic shape con-
centrator, a linear tubular receiver and a metallic support structure.
The PTC tracks the sun usually with a single axis mechanism in or-
der for the solar rays to be delivered properly in the collector aper-
ture. Usually, the PTC is placed with their axis in the North-South
direction and they track the sun in the East–West direction [22] .
This strategy leads to optimum exploitation of the incident solar
irradiation during the summer period, when the solar potential is
maximized. Otherwise, there is the option for placing the line PTC
axis in the East–West direction and tracking the sun in the North–
South direction, a strategy which leads to the better solar collec-
tion during the winter period. Usually, the PTC is separated into
modules and many modules are placed linearly in series. Many se-
ries are connected in a parallel configuration and they consist of
the total solar field. The module has usually a length close to 10 m
and totally every series has about 10–15 modules in power plants.

The useful heat production of a PTC ( Q u ) can be calculated us-

ing the energy balance on the fluid volume:
Q u = m · c p · ( T out − T in )

irradiation ( G

The parameter ( σ ) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant which is
equal to 5.67 •10 −8 W/m 2 K 4 . Moreover, the absorber emittance ( εr )
and the cover emittance ( εc ) are used in the previous equation.

The thermal losses of the cover to the ambient ( Q

sumed to be the same as the thermal losses of the absorber to the

The previous equation can be applied for cross-flow on cylindri-

around 10 W/m 2 K, for wind speeds close to 1 m/s [25] .

(14)

The absorbed solar energy ( Q

abs ) is calculated using the optical
efficiency of the solar collector ( ηopt ) and the available solar irradi-
ation ( Q s ):
abs = ηopt · Q s
Q
The optical efficiency changes with the solar irradiation incident
angle and it can be modeled using the incident angle modifier ( K )
and the maximum optical efficiency ( ηopt, max ) which is observed
for zero incident angle:
ηopt ( θ ) = K ( θ ) · ηopt,max

(15)

(16)

The incident angle modifier is a function of the geometric char-
acteristics of the PTC, as well as of the incident angle ( θ ). An an-
alytical mathematical expression for this parameter is given below
and it has been suggested by Gaul and Rabl [28] :

The previous formula takes into consideration the cosine losses
and the end losses of the PTC and it gives the optical efficiency
reduction of the collector with high accuracy. For a tracking strat-
egy with the PTC axis in North-South direction, the cosine of the
incident angle is calculated as below [22] :

(cid:12)

cos ( θ ) =

cos 2 ( θz ) + cos 2 ( δ) · sin 2 ( ω )

(18)
The zenith solar angle ( θ z ), the solar declination angle ( δ) and

the solar hour angle ( ω) are used in the previous calculation.

The maximum optical efficiency ( ηopt, max ) is a product of var-
ious parameters. Every parameter regards a different optical loss:

ηopt, max = ρtot  · γ · τ · α

(19)
The absorber absorbance ( α), the cover transmittance ( τ ), the
intercept factor ( γ ) and the total reflectance ( ρtot ) are the used pa-
rameters in the maximum optical efficiency calculation. The inter-
cept factor is usually close to 1 for optimized commercial designs.
The absorbance and the transmittance take values close to 90–95%
and they are variable from system to system. The total reflectance
includes various factors [29] as the concentrator reflectance ( ρtot ),
the tracking errors, the shading factors, the clearness factors and
any other possible reason for the optical loss. The concentrator re-
flectance takes values usually close to 90–93%, while the other fac-
tors can be about 98–99%. The total reflectance takes values close
to 80–85%. Finally, the maximum optical efficiency of a typical PTC
is around 75% [30] .

2.2.4. Heat transfer modeling of the flow

The  heat  transfer  from  the  absorber  to  the  working  fluid  is
modeled using the heat transfer coefficient ( h ). So, the useful heat
production ( Q u ) can be written as:
T r − T
Q u = A ro · h ·

(20)

(cid:4)

(cid:3)

The mean fluid temperature ( T

(21)

The  heat  transfer  coefficient  ( h )  can  be  calculated  using  the

Nusselt number:
Nu · k

h =

(22)

Usually, the flow inside the absorber of a PTC is turbulent and
in this case, the Nusselt number ( Nu ) can be calculated using the
Reynolds number ( Re ) and the Prandtl number ( Pr ), according to
the Dittus–Boelter model [31] :
Nu = 0 . 023 · R e 0 . 8 · P r 0 . 4

(23)

The previous equation is usually applied for Reynolds number

over 10,0 0 0.

2.2.5. Hydraulic modeling

The  hydraulic  modeling  of  the  PTC  is  important  in  order  to
calculate the pressure drop ( (cid:5)P ) and the pumping work demand
( W p ).

2.2.6. Performance evaluation criteria

The overall performance of the PTC has to take into consider-
ation both the useful heat production and the pumping work de-
mand for the fluid movement. So, various criteria can be applied in
order to make a suitable evaluation. In the conventional PTC, the
thermal and the exergy efficiencies are the most usual evaluation
indexes. However, there are extra criteria which are useful when
alternative designs are evaluated and compared with the reference
design.

Exergy efficiency : The exergy efficiency ( ηex ) evaluates the use-
ful heat production as the maximum equivalent work that a Carnot
thermal engine is able to produce. Moreover, it takes into consider-
ation the pressure drop along the absorber tube and the pumping
work demand for the flow movement. The exergy efficiency is de-
fined as the ratio of the useful exergy production ( E u ) to the exergy
flow if the solar irradiation ( E s ):

ηex =

E u
E s

The useful exergy production ( E u ) is calculated as [33] :

E u = Q u − m · c p · T o · ln

(29)

The exergy flow of the solar irradiation ( E s ) can be calculated
using the Petela model [34] . This formula takes into consideration
that the sun is a radiation reservoir and not a thermal reservoir.
This equation is ideal for the undiluted solar irradiation [34] . The
PTC exploits only the beam irradiation and not the diffuse, so this
model seems to be the proper one for the PTC.

The  temperature  levels  in  the  previous  equations  have  to  be
in Kelvin units, the reference temperature ( T o ) can be selected at
298.15 K and the sun temperature ( T sun ) at 5770 K.

Overall efficiency : The overall efficiency of the PTC ( ηovr ) indi-
cates the net primary heat production of the solar system. Prac-
tically,  the  equivalent  primary  energy  consumption  for  the  fluid
pumping along the collector is reduced by the useful heat produc-
tion and so the overall efficiency can be written as below [35] :

ηov r =

Q u − W p
η
el
Q s

(31)

The electrical efficiency ( η

el ) is the average electrical efficiency
of the grid and it takes values close to 33% [35] . This parameter is

used for converting the pumping work demand to the equivalent
primary energy.

Performance  evaluation  criterion:  The  performance  evaluation
criterion ( PEC ) is a flow criterion which evaluates the heat transfer
coefficient enhancement of an alternative design compared to the
reference case. This parameter is usually calculated for the eval-
uation of the heat augmentation techniques. This index evaluates
the increase of the heat transfer coefficient under the equivalent
conditions of “same pumping work demand” [36] :

f r, 0

The ( Nu

0 ) and the ( f 0 ) are the Nusselt number and the friction
factor of the reference case respectively. The reference case is usu-
ally the conventional PTC case. If the ( PEC ) is over 1, then there is
an enhancement in the flow, otherwise, the flow is not improved
and the examined method is not effective. Practically, the values of
( PEC ) greater than 1 indicate an enhancement in the heat transfer
coefficient. The enhancement of the heat transfer coefficient leads
to higher heat transfer rates in the fluid and more useful heat is
produced. Moreover, higher heat transfer coefficients lead to lower
receiver temperature, the fact that reduces the thermal losses and
increases the thermal efficiency.

Entropy generation ratio : The generation of the entropy ( (cid:5)S ) is
something expected but it is not favorable. A criterion for checking
if the flow has been enhanced is by checking the entropy genera-
tion. Thus, the ratio of the entropy generation between the exam-
ined design and the reference one ( N s ), is an important criterion. If
this criterion takes values lower than 1, then there is an enhance-
ment in the flow.
(cid:5)S
(cid:5)S 0

N s =

(33)

Usually,  the  Bejan  number  ( Be )  is  also  calculated  in  order  to
check the impact of the pressure drop in the total entropy gen-
eration.  This  number  is  the  ratio  of  the  entropy  generation  due
to the temperature increase ( (cid:5)S T ) to the total entropy generation
[37] . The total entropy generation is a result of entropy generation
due to the temperature increase ( (cid:5)S T ) and of the pressure drop
( (cid:5)S P ).

Be =

(cid:5)S T
(cid:5)S T + (cid:5)S P

(34)

In PTC, the Bejan number takes values close to 1 because the
pressure drop is generally low. However, it is able to indicate in
any case the amount of the irreversibility due to the pressure drop.
The exception is the cases with gas working fluids where the en-
tropy generation due to the pressure drop can be more intense.

The mathematical modeling of the conventional PTC proves that
numerous parameters are used in order finally the thermal perfor-
mance of the collector to be calculated. By combing the Eqs. (5 ),
( 7 )–( 9 ) and ( 14 )–(16) , it can be written:

th = ηopt, max · K ( θ ) − U L · T r − T am
η
C · G
b

(35)

Eq. (35 ) that some possible ways for enhancing the thermal per-

formance are the following:

(a) The increase of the maximum optical efficiency ( ηopt, max ) by
improving the material properties or by adding a booster re-
flector.

(b) The increase of the incident angle modifier ( K ) by improving

the tracking strategy or reducing the end losses.

(c) The decrease in the thermal loss coefficient ( U L ). It can be

example, extra insulation to the system.

(d) The reduction of the receiver temperature by increasing the
heat transfer rates on the system. This fact can be achieved
using any thermal enhancement method such as the use of
flow inserts or internal fins in the absorber.

(e) The  increase  of  the  concentration  ratio  which  can  be
achieved with the reduction of the absorber area and simul-
taneously by keeping the optical performance at high levels.

It is obvious that the previous ideas are reasonable and they can
be easily supported by Eq. (35 ). In the literature, many researchers
have examined alternative designs of PTC in order to increase the
collector performance. Many of them examined ideas as the previ-
ously stated in points (a)–(e). Moreover, many alternative designs
aim to reduce the cost of the PTC which is another important is-
sue.

This work summarizes and discusses the examined alternative
designs of PTC in the existing literature. Different ideas which try
to enhance the optical and thermal efficiency are presented. More-
over, ideas that try to create a system with lower cost and more
flexible  design  are  also  included.  To  our  knowledge,  there  is  no
other study which summarizes all these ideas together and so this
work has to add something new and important to the existing lit-
erature. The following sections include the presentation of the al-
ternative PTC designs.

3. Optical modifications

The optical modifications on the PTC aim to increase the opti-
cal efficiency and to enhance the heat flux uniformity over the ab-
sorber. They are associated with changes in the primary reflector,
as well as with the use of a secondary reflector. The alternative de-
signs aim to suggest configurations with lower cost and relatively
acceptable optical efficiency.

3.1. Modifications on the primary reflector

Various ideas have been suggested for the proper modification
of the primary receiver. These ideas try to create a more compact
design and to increase the optical efficiency when it is possible.

Zhu et al. [38] designed an alternative PTC with non-continuous
primary absorber which is similar to an LFR design idea, as it is
depicted in Fig. 3 a. They also used a secondary reflector for en-
hancing the optical efficiency. Furthermore, they used a movable
receiver in order to eliminate the end losses (see Fig. 3 b). Accord-
ing to their results, this system is able to reach up to 66% thermal
performance with transcal oil, while the thermal loss coefficient
is about 1.32 W/m 2 K. They stated that this system presents higher
performance  than  the  conventional  linear  Fresnel  reflector  (LFR)
and it has a comparative efficiency (a bit lower) than the conven-
tional PTC. They stated that the examined idea has a potential for
reduced investment cost compared to the conventional PTC. Tsai
[39] suggested a methodology for achieving uniform heat flux over
the PTC absorber. He used a free-form geometry parameterization
for designing the primary concentrator and the author finally man-
aged this goal. According to the results, the uniformity is increased
close to 97%, while the uniform heat flux distribution enhances the
thermal performance of the collector compared to the conventional
design with water as the working fluid. The suggested configura-
tion is found to have a high thermal efficiency which is about 0.5%
lower than the ideal case of an ideally uniform heat flux distribu-
tion over the absorber periphery. However, these results are found
for an extremely low concentration ratio (close to 2) and so it is
debatable if the suggested method can be applied in real systems
with concentration ratios around 30.

The use of a variable concentration ratio design along the PTC
length has been suggested by Wang et al. [40] for enhancing the
methanol  reforming process.  The  new suggested  configuration  is
depicted in Fig. 4 . This idea aims to achieve the optimum heat flux
distribution along the receiver and consequently to create the ideal
temperature levels in the different parts of the receiver. Finally, it is
found that this idea is able to increase the process efficiency up to
16% compared to the conventional PTC case. This idea is a promis-
ing choice for applications of methanol reforming but is not clear
if it is beneficial for conventional solar thermal systems. Maatal-
lah et al. [41] proposed the design of a PTC with the stationary
primary receiver. They selected to use a cylindrical shape primary
reflector and the receiver tracks the sun. This design is a low-cost
design because it does not include complex tracking mechanisms
and it is an important advantage of this idea. They optimized the
collector and they found that the optimum concentration ratio is

88

E. Bellos and C. Tzivanidis / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 71 (2019) 81–117

Ma et al. [42] designed a compact PTC with lenses as primary
reflectors which is illustrated in Fig. 5 . This design is similar to a
great cylinder with lenses in the upper part and the receiver tube
in the center. They found that this design reaches up to 84% op-
tical efficiency and it is able to operate at 250 °C with thermal oil
(YD320). Moreover, they stated that the receiver has to be located
150 mm over the focal point in order to improve the optical per-
formance in a greater range of incident angles. Another interesting
idea is the rotation of the solar field in order to follow the sun az-
imuth angle. Qu et al. [43] studied a PTC solar field in a rotating
platform, as it is depicted in  Fig. 6 .  The examined configuration
was a porotype with a nominal power of 300 kW operating with
Dowtherm A. Their results showed that the daily performance of
this system can be increased by up to 5% compared to the conven-
tional system with single-axis tracking. Moreover, they found that
the daily performance with this system is about 63% in the sum-
mer and 40% in the winter, while the mean annual efficiency is
about 50%. Finally, the authors stated that the rotating platform is
a promising idea for reducing the collecting area and creating more
cost-effective designs with higher thermal efficiency. However, it
is important to test this idea with a detailed financial analysis for
commercial systems of greater nominal power.

3.2. The use of secondary reflectors

The use of a secondary reflector has been examined by various
researchers in the literature and different types of secondary re-
flectors have been studied. The general idea is to capture the solar
rays which do not reach the absorber and so to increase the in-
tercept factor and consequently the optical efficiency. Furthermore,
the utilization of a secondary reflector can lead to a more uniform
heat flux distribution over the absorber periphery because the so-
lar irradiation is not only concentrated in the low part of the ab-
sorber, as in the conventional PTC, but in the entire periphery of
the absorber. Moreover, the use of a secondary reflector reduces
the sensitivity of the system in the tracking errors because the sec-
ondary receiver is able to manipulate properly the solar rays which
do not reach directly to the absorber after the primary reflections.
Abdelhamid et al. [44] investigated a two-stage PTC with a sec-
ondary  compound  parabolic  shape  concentrator  in  order  to  in-
crease  the  total  concentration  ratio.  Fig.  7  depicts  the  examined
configuration which presents a concentration ratio around 60 and
it can operate at 365 °C outlet temperature with thermal oil (Du-
ratherm  600),  while  the  thermal  efficiency  was  about  37%.  It  is
important  to  state  that  the  use  of  two-stage  concentration  with
high concentration ratio increases the need for a precise design,
something that increases the installation cost. Wang et al. [45] sug-
gested the use of a secondary parabolic trough concentrator and

about 20 with a rim angle of 80 °. Moreover, they stated that the
optimum orientation of the collector is in the East-West direction.
They concluded that their system is able to reach optical perfor-
mances  up  to  70–75%  in  the  solar  noon,  while  the  optical  per-
formance during the day has acceptable values. The suggested de-
sign has lower performance than the conventional PTC but it has
lower cost due to the elimination of tracking demand. So, this is
a promising choice in cases where there is no restriction for high
efficiency but there is a need for low investment cost.

they moved the absorber close to the primary concentrator. This
technique aids to enhance the uniformity of the heat flux distribu-
tion over the absorber and so to reduce the thermal stresses. The
finally found that the maximum temperature of the absorber is 6 K
lower than the conventional case with Syltherm 800 as the work-
ing fluid but there is a penalty of 4% in the optical efficiency. They
stated that this technique leads to lower performance but to more
reliable systems with lower failure possibilities.

seagull secondary reflector [48] (License Number: 4402641367833).

Rodriguez-Sanchez and Rosengarten [46] suggested the use of a
flat secondary concentrator over the absorber in order to increase
the concentration ratio (see Fig. 8 ). Their idea is to reduce the ab-
sorber diameter and to concentrate the solar energy in a smaller
absorber area. They managed to increase the concentration ratio
up to 80% for collectors with great focal distance and rim angles
close to 80 °. They stated that this idea is a promising choice for
cases  with  space  restrictions  like  the  building  rooftops.  Further-
more, the use of a trapezoidal cavity receiver has been examined
optically by Liang et al. [47] . They found the optical efficiency of
the  total  configuration  to  be  around  85%  while  the  optical  effi-
ciency of the absorber tube to be about 45%. Moreover, they stated
that this system has satisfying performance in the cases with in-
creases tracking errors of the primary reflector ( Fig. 9 ).

Various  secondary  reflectors  inside  the  evacuated  tube  have
been  examined  by  Wirz  et  al.  [48]  in  order  for  the  optical  and
the thermal efficiencies to be enhanced. Fig. 10 illustrates the ex-
amined ideas which are a reflective glass, a reflecting insulation
layer,  aplanatic  mirrors  and  tailored  seagull  secondary  reflector.
They found that the initial design has 65% optical efficiency and
only the aplanatic mirrors are able to increase the optical efficiency
at 65.1%. The thermal analysis was performed with synthetic oil as
working fluids and for temperature level at 390 °C. In the thermal
performance,  they  found  that  all  the  configurations  enhance  the

collector  performance.  The  benchmark  design  has  58.8%  thermal
efficiency for a reference case, while the case with the glass reflec-
tor 59.8%, the case with reflective insulation 59.7%, the aplanatic
mirrors 60.4% and the tailored seagull 59.6%. It is essential to state
that the heat flux distribution over the absorber is the key factor
for the thermal enhancement of the examined cases.

The  use  of  PTC  for  lighting  purposes  is  a  very  interesting
idea  which  has  been  examined  in  the  literature.  Ullah  and  Shin
[49]  studied  the  use  of  a  multi-stage  PTC  for  lighting  purposes
as Fig. 11 exhibits for a location of 37.5 ° latitude. They used op-
tical fibers for transferring the reflected solar rays inside a build-
ing. They found that this technique can lead to adequate indoor
lighting. More specifically, they found that this technique creates
higher interior  illuminance uniformity  than  the  traditional  light-
ing systems. Lastly, they stated that the examined idea presents a
high cost and there is a need for the proper optimization for re-
ducing the investment cost. Li and Yuan [50] examined a similar
system with a PTC of 8 m 2 for providing lighting and heating for a
building of 500 m 2 floor area. The total efficiency was found 39.4%
which is separated to 16.3% lighting efficiency and 23.1% thermal
efficiency.  Moreover,  they  found  that  the  electricity  savings  can
reach up to 90% and the payback period of this investment is up
to 10 years for the location of Los Angeles. However, in other loca-
tions, the payback period can be higher with the Seattle to be the
less suitable location with a payback period of 25 years for com-
mercial applications.

3.3. Summary of the optical modification methods

The analysis of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 make obvious the high in-
terest in the optical modifications of PTC. Various ideas about the
primary concentrator and the receiver design have been tested ex-
perimentally and numerically. Table 1 includes the studies of this
work which are associated with optical modification ideas. Gener-
ally, these studies try to achieve the following goals:

• Use  the  solar  irradiation  for  lighting  purposes  in  an  indoor

space [49,50] .

The previous goals are reasonable and they have been achieved
by the presented studies. This fact indicates that the research on
the optical improvements/modifications of the PTC is important in
order to design sustainable and highly efficient systems.

It can be said that the suggested designs lead to high optical
efficiencies which directly lead to increases in useful heat produc-
tion yield. For instance, the use of cylindrical design with lenses
[42] leads to 84% optical efficiency and the rotating platform leads
to daily thermal performance increase close to 5%. The use of a
non-continuous  primary  reflector  is  able  to  reduce  the  mechan-
ical  difficulties  of  the  system  and  to  achieve  an  acceptable  effi-
ciency by up to 66% [38] . Moreover, it is important to state that
the use of secondary reflectors inside the evacuated tube is able
to increase the thermal efficiency up to 2.7% due to the increased
optical efficiency and the more uniform heat flux distribution over
the absorber periphery [48] . An alternative idea is the use of PTC
for lighting purposes which seems to be an interesting idea for fu-
ture applications. However, this technology faces limitations due to
high attenuation losses in the optical fibers and maybe it is more
sustainable for solar dish collectors.

It has to be stated that in any case, the increased cost and the
possible manufacturing difficulties  play an  important role  in the
establishment of the optical enhancement ideas. The cost of the
system is increased in the cases where there is a need for an ex-
tra mechanism or for a precise design. For instance, in the case of
a rotating platform [43] the investment cost is higher and also a
more intelligent control system is needed. On the other hand, the
investment cost is not high in the case that there is a stationary
system [41] or in the cases without evacuated tube [47] . However,
in the cases with lower cost, there is a penalty in the efficiency and
so there is a need for deeper financial analysis for these systems.

4. Thermal modifications

• Increase the concentration ratio in order to achieve operation

at higher temperatures [45] .

• Create a more uniform heat flux over the absorber in order to

reduce the thermal losses [39] .

• Reduce the complexity and the cost of the system [47] .
• Improve the efficiency of a process, like the methanol reforming

[40] .

• Create systems which can operate without tracking system or

not be so sensitive in the tracking errors.

The thermal enhancement methods aim to increase the thermal
performance of the solar collector by reducing the thermal losses
or by increasing the heat transfer rates between the absorber and
working fluid. More specifically, the thermal enhancement can be
achieved by reducing the thermal loss coefficient ( U L ) and by in-
creasing the heat convection coefficient inside the flow ( h ). More-
over, the use of new working fluids, the nanofluids, is usual in the
literature because these fluids present superior optical and thermal
properties.

efficiency is small, while there is a high potential for reduction in
the thermal losses. Al-Ansary and Zeitoun [51] examined this idea
in a PTC with air in the tube cavity (non-evacuated tube). They
found that the use of insulation in a PTC with non-vacuum is able
to enhance the performance and to lead to more cost-effective sys-
tems, ideal for low and medium temperatures. Moreover, Chandra
et al. [52] found that the use of insulation is able to decrease the
thermal loss coefficient of a non-evacuated tube PTC up to 20% for
operation with Therminol VP-1. Moreover, the use of insulation has
been highlighted as an effective way of reducing the cost of the re-
ceivers up to 20% and so it seems to be a cost-effective technique
for application in PTC. Osorio et al. [53] studied a PTC with a trans-
parent insulation material between the absorber and the cover, as
Fig. 13 exhibits. They found that this configuration leads to higher
thermal  efficiency  for  temperature  levels  over  300 °C.  After  this
temperature level, the radiation thermal losses of the conventional
PTC  are  higher  than  the  insulation conduction  thermal  losses  in
the alternative design and thus this collector is recommended for
operation at high temperatures.

To conclude about the use of insulation material, it can be said
that this idea can compete with the non-evacuated tubes and it is
a choice for designing low-cost receivers with a relatively accept-
able efficiency. The transparent insulation is a promising choice but
more research is needed for this technology.

The next part of the literature studies is devoted to modification
about the reduction of the radiation thermal losses. Wang et al.
[54] examined the idea of using a radiation shield in the upper
part of the absorber tube. Fig. 14 shows this configuration which
has a metallic part between the absorber and the cover. This part
aims to reduce the thermal losses of the PTC. According to the re-
sults, it is found that this idea is able to reduce the thermal losses

4.1. General design ideas

4.1.1. Thermal loss coefficient reduction

The first part of the studies aims at the reduction of the ther-
mal loss coefficient. These thermal losses are mainly radiation ther-
mal  losses  of  the  absorber  to  the  cover.  One  interesting  idea  in
the literature is the use of insulation material in the top part of
the evacuated tube collector. This insulation material is located be-
tween the absorber and the cover, as Fig. 12 shows. The insulation
is located in the upper part because this part does not absorb im-
portant amounts of solar irradiation. So, the penalty in the optical

by about 24% for both selecting and non-selective absorber coat-
ings. Yang et al. [55] proposed a double coating PTC which uses
different coatings in the upper and in the down part of the ab-
sorber.  They  found  that  this  idea  is  able  to  reduce  the  thermal
losses close to 31%. More specifically, they stated that for operation
at 500 °C with molten salt, the conventional PTC has 64.7% thermal
efficiency, while the double coating has 68.1%. Furthermore, they
calculated that the levelized cost of electricity with the suggested
idea can be lower than the conventional PTC with a reduction of
5%.  This  is  an  important  result  which  proves  that  the  trade-offs
between the higher energy production and the higher investments
costs are positive and lead to a viable configuration ( Fig. 15 ).

4.1.2. Alternative designs of absorbers

A lot of research has been focused on alternative designs of PTC
absorbers because the conventional evacuated tubes have high cost
and also they present durability problems in high-temperature ap-
plications. The use of a flat absorber with an asymmetrical reflec-
tor  for  steam  generation  was  examined  by  Bortolato  et  al.  [56] .
Fig. 16 illustrates this configuration which presents 82% optical ef-
ficiency and 64% thermal efficiency for temperature levels close to
100–120 °C. The authors stated that the examined design is a flex-
ible configuration which gives the possibilities for an overall cost-
effective design. Halimi et al. [57] studied a PTC with a U-tube ab-
sorber, as it is given in Fig. 17 . They examined different locations
of the internal U-tubes and they found the parallel configuration of

Fig. 17 to be the best design with a thermal efficiency of 40%. Liang
et al. [58] examined a cavity receiver with flat cover glass and in-
sulation, as it is depicted in Fig. 18 . The authors claimed that this
design is better the solar fields with many modules in series. They
found that the examined prototype has 48% thermal efficiency at
80 °C and 34% thermal efficiency at 160 °C with synthetic oil. Chen
et al. [59] studied a PTC with a V-cavity receiver as it is depicted
in Fig. 19 . They studied the configuration with and without addi-
tional fins inside the flow. They concluded that this collector is a
low-cost design which is able to operate over 300 °C with thermal
oil. In low-temperature levels, this system has about 55% thermal
efficiency operating with water, while at higher temperature the
efficiency significantly reduces. Moreover, they found that the use
of internal fins leads to higher heat transfer rates.

The previous ideas seem to be interesting but they need more
investigation in order to compete with the conventional PTC. The
most efficient choices are the use of a flat absorber with an asym-
metrical  reflector  [56]  which  leads  to  64%  thermal  efficiency  at
120 °C,  as  well  as  the  V-cavity  receiver  [59]  which  operates at
300 °C with 55% thermal efficiency.

Other  researchers  have  suggested  significantly  novel  designs
which are not close to the conventional PTC image. Wang et al.
[60]  studied  a  PTC  with  a  thermosiphon  receiver,  as  it  is  given
in Fig. 20 . This design has a horizontal evaporator, a condenser, a
riser, and a downcomer with a U-turn. They suggested that this
system is a good choice for the temperature ranges of 20 0–40 0 °C
operating with Dowtherm A and it has not the conventional diffi-
culties of other natural phase circulation systems, due to its unique
design. Good et al. [61] examined a PTC with air as working fluid

with an alternative design. This PTC has a dome and inside it, there
is the receiver, as Fig. 21 depicts. They stated that this system is
able  to  operate  up  to  500 °C.  Moreover,  in  another  work  about
this  collector  by  Bader  et  al.  [62] ,  it  is  found  that  this  collector
has thermal efficiency up to 65% for temperature levels at 125 °C
and up to 42% for temperature levels at 500 °C with air as working
fluid.

4.1.3. Other ideas about PTC

It  is  essential  to  include  some  other  ideas  which  are  associ-
ated with the PTC. Forman et al. [63] designed a novel PTC with
an optimized structure. This PTC has independent parts merged to
light-weight and solid system, as it is given in Fig. 22 . This system
can be a low-cost and compact design for the future PTCs. Anwar
et al. [64] examined a receiver of a PTC with phase change mate-
rials (LiNO
3 ) in order to store thermal energy. This configuration
is depicted in Fig. 23 and it is like a thermal battery. The receiver
rotates in order to have uniform heat flux in its periphery. More-
over, Nation et al. [65] studied a thermal battery with NaS inside
the absorber tube. In this collector, the heat transfer fluid (thermal
oil) flows in the annulus between the storage material and the ab-
sorber tube, as Fig. 24 shows. They found that this collector has a
thermal efficiency between 61% and 75%.

4.1.4. Summary of the general design ideas

It is found that there are numerous ideas with thermal modifi-
cations in the receiver. These modifications try to reduce the ther-
mal  losses  and  also  to  create  flexible  and  cost-effective  designs.
Table 2 includes these studies with a brief description and their
main findings.

Generally, it has been found that the thermal modifications re-
duce  the  thermal  losses  close  to  20–30%  [54 , 55] .  The  use  of  a
double coating [55] , as well as the use of a radiation shield [54] ,
seems  to  be  the  most  effective  ways  for  enhancing  the  perfor-
mance.  About  the  utilization  of  insulation  material  between  the
cover and the absorber, it has been found that it is a promising
choice which can compete with the non-evacuated tubes in terms
of efficiency [51 –53] .

The use of cavity receiver is able to give adequate useful heat
production at medium temperatures [56 , 58 , 59] , while the use of
alternative designs with air can lead to efficient operation at 500 °C
[61 , 62] .  The  use  of  a  flat  absorber  with  an  asymmetrical  reflec-
tor [56] and the use of a V-cavity receiver [59] are the most effi-
cient choices for medium and high-temperature levels respectively.
Moreover, it has been found that the use of thermal storage in-
side the PTC is a promising future choice [64 , 65] . Lastly, the use
of alternative designs is able to manufacture systems with lower

weight and lower cost because of the less material utilization [63] .
However, it has to be stated that the commercialization of the al-
ternative ideas needs many steps in order to achieve low manufac-
turing costs and to have the proper reliability levels.

4.2. Flow modifications

The use of flow modifications aims to increase the heat trans-
fer rates inside the flow. The higher heat rates (or heat transfer

coefficients) lead to lower receiver temperature and consequently
to  lower  thermal  losses.  So,  the  thermal  efficiency  is  enhanced.
The use of modified absorbers creates passive vortexes inside the
flow and so there is higher effective thermal conductivity. More-
over, there is better mixing in the flow and the heat input of the
solar energy is delivered in the entire fluid domain with a better
way. The previous mechanism describes the reasons for the heat
transfer coefficients enhancement. However, the thermal enhance-
ment techniques usually are associated with problems such pres-
sure drop increase, higher investment cost and need for creating

reliable designs. So, the proper criteria have to be applied for eval-
uating the overall heat transfer enhancement and the overall per-
formance improvement in any case.

4.2.1. Flow inserts

The first category of studies regards the use of flow inserts in-
side the flow. There are different ideas about the flow inserts. The
most usual is the twisted tape insert which is located centrally in
the absorber tube and aims to mix the flow along the tube. Mwe-
sigye et al. [66] studied the use of a wall-detached twisted tape
insert in a PTC operating with the thermal oil Syltherm 800, as it
is depicted in Fig. 25 . They found a 58% decrease in the entropy
generation,  168%  higher  heat  transfer  coefficient  and  68%  lower
circumferential temperature difference in the absorber tube. More-
over, they stated that the thermal efficiency of the PTC can increase
up to 10%, while there is an important increase in the friction fac-
tor up to 14 times. Zhu et al. [67] examined a wavy-tape insert in
a PTC with a sinusoid shape, as it is given in Fig. 26 , for operation
with Syltherm 800. They found that this idea reduces the thermal
losses by 33%, while there is an increase in the Nusselt number
300% and on the friction factor 400%. Sahin et al. [68] examined

the use of a wire coil insert (see Fig. 27 ) inside and absorber tube
and they found 200% increase in the Nusselt number and many
times higher pressure drop compared to the empty tube for oper-
ation with water. Song et al. [69] studied a screw tape insert inside
the absorber tube which is depicted in Fig. 28 . They used Syltherm
800 and they found that  the thermal losses can significantly be
reduced by up to 67%, while the pressure drop increases about 5
times compared to the smooth case. Chang et al. [70] examined
the use of an eccentric rod insert in the absorber operating with
molten salt, as it is depicted in Fig. 29 . They found the optimum
location to be in the upper absorber part with a small eccentric-
ity. The Nusselt number can be increased up to 7 times, while the
friction factor can be increased up to 14 times with this technique.
Bellos and Tzivanidis [71] suggested the use of a star flow insert in
a PTC, as it is depicted in Fig. 30 . They found that the thermal effi-
ciency for operation with Syltherm 800 can be enhanced by 1%,
while  the  thermal  losses  are  decreased  by  up  to  15%.  The  heat
transfer  enhancement  is  found  to  be  about  50–70%,  while  there
are important increases in the pressure drop. However, the pump-
ing work demand was extremely low in all the cases. Also, they
stated that the examined idea reduces the thermal stresses in the
absorber and this fact is able to reduce the failure rate in the ab-

sorbers. So, the overall financial performance of the system can be
enhanced because of the lower replacement rate of the absorbers.
Jamal-Abad et al. [72] examined the use of metal foam inside the
absorber tube operating with water, as it is given in Fig. 31 . They
found thermal efficiency enhancement up to 3%, 8 times greater
Nusselt number and extremely high-pressure drop increase (over

100 times). Mwesigye et al. [73] studied the perforated plate in-
serts of Fig. 32 and they found an overall efficiency enhancement
between 1.2% and 8% for operation with Syltherm 800. Ghasemi
and Ranjbar [74] examined the use of porous rings (see Fig. 33 )
inside the absorber which operates with Syltherm 800 and they
found 50% Nusselt number increase and also they stated there is

Kasperski [75] examined the use of a solar air-heater with an in-
ternal multiple-fin array, as it is given in Fig. 34 . They found that
this collector has a maximum efficiency of about 40% and thermal
loss coefficient close to 1.6 W/m 2 K.

The previous studies, with a brief description and their main
findings, are summarized in Table 3 . It is obvious that the use of
flow  inserts  enhances  the  Nusselt  number  but  the  thermal  effi-

low thermal losses of the PTC due to the evacuated tube collec-
tor. Moreover, the use of flow inserts leads to a great increase in
the pressure drop, a fact that has to be taken into consideration
in the overall evaluation. The pressure drop can be many times in-
creased, compared to the reference case, but it has been found that
the overall performance is enhanced [73] and the pumping work
demand value is generally low [71] . Among the previously exam-
ined cases, the use of twisted tape inserts [66] and of perforated
plate inserts [73] are the cases which lead to the highest thermal
efficiency enhancements.

4.2.2. Modified inner absorber geometry

Another important part of the literature is devoted to modify-
ing the inner absorber geometry in order to create more turbulent
flow conditions. These ideas are applied to the entire absorber sur-
face or in the down part because, in this area, there is high solar
heat flux concentration. Cheng et al. [76] studied the use of lon-
gitudinal vortex generators in the down part of the absorber, as
Fig. 35 shows. They found 13% thermal loss decrease and a 100%
increase in the pressure drop for operation with Syltherm 800. Xi-
angtao et al. [77] examined the use of fin pin arrays in the down
part of the absorber operating with D12 thermal oil, as Fig. 36 il-
lustrates. According to their results, there is a small Nusselt num-
ber and friction factor increase. Bellos et al. [78] studied the use
of  internal  longitudinal fins  in  all  the  periphery of  the  absorber
for operation with Syltherm 800. Fig. 37 exhibits the eight exam-

ined internal fins which are symmetrically located in the absorber
tube. They finally found that this technique is able to enhance the
thermal efficiency by up to 1.5%, while there is a penalty in the
pressure drop. Moreover, Bellos et al. [79] optimized the number
and  the  location  of  the  internal  longitudinal  fins  inside  the  ab-
sorber tube. This work has performed for a constant flow rate of
150 L/min with Syltherm 800 as the working fluid. They found that
the optimum design has three fins in the down part and in this
case,  there  is  0.51%  thermal  efficiency  enhancement.  The  use  of
helical fins inside the absorber (see Fig. 38 ) has been examined
by Munoz and Abanades [80] and it is found to enhance the ther-
mal efficiency of about 3% with Syltherm 800 as the working fluid.
They also stated that the examined idea has positive financial po-
tential. More specifically, they stated that the use of internal fins
is estimated to increase to collector initial cost at 5% and this in-
crease will lead to an overall power plant cost increase of 0.5%.
The power plant power production increase will be about 2% and
so the overall sense is that the use of the helical internal fins leads
to a viable investment.

Fuqiang et al. [81] examined the use of an asymmetric outward
convex corrugated tube which is given in Fig. 39 . They used the

in the Nusselt number and in the friction factor for operation with
Therminol VP1. Bellos et al. [83] studied a converging-diverging ab-
sorber tube (see Fig. 41 ) which increases the thermal efficiency of
about 4.5% with thermal oil as the working fluid. In another recent
work, Bitam et al. [84] investigated a sinusoidal absorber tube of
Fig. 42 which presents 3% thermal efficiency enhancement and a
50% increase in pressure drop for operation with Syltherm 800.

The  previous  studies  show  that  the  use  of  internal  modifica-
tions  leads  to  performance  enhancement  with  a  relatively  low
penalty  in  the  pressure  drop.  Thus,  it  can  be  said  that  the  lim-
itation of the pressure drop increase is not as intense as in the
studies about flow inserts. Table 4 summarizes the previous stud-
ies with their main findings. It remarkable to state that the highest
thermal efficiency enhancements are found in the cases of helical
fins [80] and converging-diverging absorber geometry [83] .

4.3. Nanofluid-based solar collectors

The use of nanofluids in PTC has been examined by many re-
searchers.  Nanofluids  are  special  working  fluids  with  improved
thermal and optical properties. The term nanofluid has been de-
fined by Choi and Eastman in 1995 [85] . The nanofluids are created
by dispersing some nanoparticles in a base fluid. The most usual

selt  number.  Huang  et  al.  [82]  studied  a  dimpled  absorber  tube
which is depicted in Fig. 40 and they found up to 20% increase

are usually thermal oils or water, while the use of molten salts is
more restricted. Fig. 43 shows the nanofluid samples (oil/MWCNT)

The  nanofluids  present  increased  thermal  conductivity  which
leads to greater heat transfer rates inside the flow. Moreover, the
viscosity is increased; the fact that leads to higher pressure losses
and  this  is  a  limitation  of  nanofluids.  The  density  of  nanofluid
is  higher  than  in  the  base  fluid,  while  the  specific  heat  capac-
ity is lower in nanofluids. But, the product of the density-specific
heat  capacity  (or  the  volumetric  specific  heat  capacity)  of  the
nanofluid is close to the respective of the base fluid, so this pa-

rameter does not play a so significant role on the collector perfor-
mance, except some seldom cases. The basic mathematical model-
ing for the calculation of the nanofluid thermal properties is given
in Appendix A. Furthermore, the nanofluids are ideal working flu-
ids in transparent collectors because they absorb high amounts of
solar irradiation. The nanofluids can be used for optical filtering of
the sunlight and so they can be applied in novel designs.

However, the use of nanofluids is conjugated with many limi-
tations about their utilization. First of all, the nanofluids have high
cost and they increase the initial investment cost of the system.
Moreover, the operation cost is increased due to the higher pump-

In a recent work, the SWCNT dispersed in Therminol VP-1 has
been  examined  by  Mwesigye  and  Meyer  [95] .  They  used  a  CFD
model and they found 4.4% thermal efficiency enhancement and
also  the  nanofluid  utilization  leads  to  70%  lower  entropy  gen-
eration.  Furthermore,  it  is  essential  to  state  that  Kasaeian  et  al.
[96]  found  that  the  oil/MWCNT  leads  to  0.5%  thermal  efficiency
enhancement using a numerical model. Moreover, they conducted
a  financial  analysis  and  they  determined  the  payback  period  of
the nanofluid utilization to be 3.8 years for inlet temperature at
100 °C  and  4.7  years  for  inlet  temperature  at  30 °C.  In  another
work, Kasaeian et al. [97] found in an experimental study about 5%
thermal efficiency enhancement with the use of oil/MWCNT. In an-
other interesting study, Kolb et al. [18] proved that the nanofluid-
based thermal oils lead to higher thermal efficiency enhancement
than the molten salt-based nanofluids, compared to the respective
pure base fluids in every case.

An alternative idea is the use of hybrid nanofluids in a PTC. Bel-
2 O
los and Tzivanidis [98] found that the use of Syltherm 800/(Al
3
-  TiO
2 )  hybrid  nanofluid  leads  to  1.8%  thermal  efficiency  en-
hancement  while  the  respective  mono  nanofluids  lead  to  only
∼0.7% thermal efficiency enhancement. Additionally, Minea and El-
Maghlany [99] studied the water/(Cu - MgO) hybrid nanofluid and
they  found  6%  thermal  efficiency  enhancement,  20%  increase  in
the heat transfer coefficient and approximately 20% increase in the
pressure drop.

ing work demand, a result of the increased viscosity. Furthermore,
there  are  stability  problems  with  nanofluids  because  of  the  ag-
glomeration. These stability problems are usually faced with the
use of proper surfactants. The mechanical and the chemical ero-
sion, as well as the toxicity of nanofluids, are other important is-
sues. All the previous factors make the use of nanofluid to be more
difficult at this time and they indicate the need for further stud-
ies  and  research  in  this  area.  In  any  case,  the  potential  for  the
higher energy harvesting with nanofluids is clear in the literature
and thus they are a promising idea.

4.3.1. Conventional PTC with nanofluids

The  use  of  Al

3  nanoparticle  is  the  most  usual  choice  in
nanofluid-based  PTC.  Subramani  et  al.  [89]  found  experimen-
tally  that  the  use  of  water/Al
3  leads  to  8.5%  thermal  effi-

ciency enhancement. Mwesigye et al. [90] found that the Syltherm
800/Al
3  nanofluid  leads  to  7.6%  thermal  efficiency  enhance-
ment with a 40% penalty in pressure drop. Moreover, Bellos et al.
[83] found that the use of oil/Al
3 nanofluid is able to enhance

the  PTC  thermal  performance  close  to  4.3%.  In  another  study,

Moreover, there are studies which compare the Al

with other nanofluids. Bellos et al. [87] found that the Syltherm

3  to 1.13%. Ghasemi and Ran-
ment, while the Syltherm 800/Al
jbar  [92]  found  that  the  water/CuO  nanofluid  has  a  bit  higher
heat  transfer  coefficient  enhancement  ( ∼35%)  compared  to  the
3 nanofluid ( ∼28%). They stated that the pressure drop

increase with both nanofluids is about 40%. On the other hand, Re-

The previous studies show that the nanofluids are able to en-
hance the thermal efficiency of the solar collector. The penalty in
the pressure drop is generally reasonable and this fact proves the
minor importance of this parameter on the overall system perfor-
mance. Table 5 summarizes the previous studies with the proper
details. It is useful to state that the highest thermal efficiency en-
hancements have been found with water-based nanofluids and es-
pecially water/Al
3 [89 , 93] . In some comparative
studies, the use of CuO [87 , 92] is the best case. Moreover, the use
of oil/MWCNT [97] seems to be another promising choice.

4.3.2. Direct absorption PTC with nanofluids

The last years, there is an increasing number of literature stud-
ies about the use of direct absorption parabolic trough collectors
(DAPTC). This collector is similar to a conventional PTC but it has
a  double  glass  receiver.  Inside the  receiver,  there  is  a  base  fluid
(for instance water) or usually a nanofluid which directly captures
the incident solar irradiation. It has been found that the nanofluids
are ideal working fluids for absorbing the solar irradiation [100] . A
typical image of the DAPTC is given in Fig. 44 . It is obvious that
the solar irradiation reaches in the working fluid inside the double
transparent tube.

Kasaeian  et  al.  [102]  examined  a  direct  absorption  PTC  with
ethylene glycol/MWCNT nanofluid for volumetric concentrations up
to 0.3%. They stated that the optical efficiency of the solar collector
reaches up to 71.4% for the case with 0.3% MWNCNT. In this case,
the solar collector has a 17% higher thermal performance compared
to the pure base fluid case. Menbari et al. [103] studied the use
of water/CuO nanofluid for volumetric concentrations of 0.002% up
to 0.008% and they found thermal efficiency enhancements from
18% to 52% respectively. Furthermore, O’Keeffe et al. [101] proved
that the concentration of about 2% is adequate for maximizing the
DAPTC thermal performance. Fan et al. [104] suggested a double
pass direct absorption PTC with Syltherm 800/Al nanofluid which
is depicted in Fig. 45 . This configuration has the absorption fluid in
the region between the cover and the absorber tube, while there is
also heat transfer fluid inside the absorber. They stated that their
system has relatively high efficiency and it can substitute the se-
lective PTC with a sacrifice in the efficiency up to 4%. Dugaria et al.
[105] investigated a flat volumetric receiver for direct absorption in
a PTC, as it is depicted in Fig. 46 . They found that this design has a

They stated that this design suffers from huge nano-powder depo-
sition within the receiver pipe, due to humidity, as it is depicted
in Fig. 47 .

4.3.3. Applications with nanofluid-based PTC

The use of nanofluid-based PTC in applications has been exam-
ined by various researchers in the last years. The literature stud-
ies are summarized in Table 6 with the basic details. The appli-
cations are generally for electricity and refrigeration/cooling pro-
duction. The examined studies are theoretical works and there are
no experimental works about nanofluid-based solar systems cou-
pled with applications. The general sense of the Table 6 data indi-
cates an important enhancement in the system performance with
the use of nanofluid-based solar systems.

Firstly,  the  studies  about  refrigeration  and  cooling  are  given.
Abu-Hamdeh and Almitani [108] studied a regenerated liquid des-
iccant cooling system driven by nanofluid-based PTC (see Fig. 48 ).
The best nanofluid was found to be the water/ZnO which leads to
thermal efficiency enhancement up to 50%. Ratlamwala and Abid
[109] studied a multi-effect absorption cooling system driven by
nanofluid-based  PTC.  According  to  their  results,  the  water/Al
2 O
3
nanofluid is able to enhance the heat transfer rates up to 56%.

In electricity production applications, there is a greater variety
of studies. Toghyani et al. [110] studied a Rankine cycle driven by

maximum optical efficiency close to 90% with water/SWCNT, while
the conventional pure water system gives optical efficiency close to
82%. This is a promising result which indicates important enhance-
ment margin with the nanofluid-based direct absorption systems.
Furthermore,  the  use  of  gas  phase  nanofluids  in  DAPTC  has
been  also  studied.  De  Risi  et  al.  [106]  studied  a  water/steam
nanofluid  with  a  mixture  of  CuO  and  Ni.  They  found  that  the
optimum design leads to 62.5% thermal efficiency. Potenza et al.

3 and water/Fe

The  last  part  of  the  literature  studies  regards  the  multi-
generation systems. Abid et al. [114] examined a multi-generation
system with a Rankine cycle for electricity production and an elec-
trolyzer  for  hydrogen  production  (see  Fig.  50 ).  They  applied  the
water/Al
3 nanofluids in PTC. According to their
results, the system is able to produce about 8.17 kW electricity and
0.02454 g/s  hydrogen.  Bellos  and  Tzivanidis  [115]  studied  a  solar
driven trigeneration system with nanofluid-based PTC. The exam-
ined  configuration  includes  an  Organic  Rankine  Cycle  (ORC)  and
2 O. In this work,
an absorption heat pump operating with LiBr-H
Syltherm 800/CuO and Syltherm 800/Al
3 nanofluids are tested,
while the authors studied different or ganic working fluids in the
thermodynamic cycle. The final results proved that the best case
is the one with toluene in the ORC and water/CuO nanofluid in
the solar field. The optimum nanoparticle concentration was found
to be 4.35% which leads to 1.8% overall system efficiency enhance-
ment.

nanofluid-based PTC. They investigated various oil-based nanoflu-
ids. The maximum exergy efficiency enhancement of the system
was about 11% with the oil/Al
3 nanofluid. Alashkar and Gadalla
[111] examined the use of nanofluid-based PTC for feeding a Rank-
ine power cycle. According to their results, the maximum thermal
efficiency enhancement was up to 12%. Moreover, they stated that
the use of nanofluids is able to decrease the levelized cost of elec-
tricity from 0.0411 €/kWh with pure Therminol to 0.0407 €/kWh
with Therminol/Ag nanofluid (4% volumetric concentration). Abid
et  al.  [112]  also  studied  a  Rankine  power  cycle  with  nanofluid-
based PTC. They found the exergy efficiency of the system to be
around 23%. The use of nanofluid-based PTC coupled to an Organic
Rankine  cycle  has  been  studied  by  Bellos  and  Tzivanidis  [113] .

The comparative studies of the thermal enhancement methods
compare different techniques under the same operating conditions
and so the comparison can be conducted in a proper way. Firstly,
it is essential to state a theoretical study about the thermal en-
hancement methods in PTC which has been conducted by Bellos
et al. [116] . They found that the thermal enhancement of a com-
mercial and high efficient PTC can reach up to 2.0–2.5%. This small
enhancement range is explained by the low thermal losses of the
PTC which gives small enhancement margins in PTC with evacu-
ated receivers.

Too and Benito [117] compared the use of porous foam, twisted
tape inserts, wire coils and dimpled absorber tube. According to
their results, the use of dimpled absorber is the most promising

choice  which  leads  to  0.8%  thermal  efficiency  enhancement  for
operation with air. This choice was determined using the perfor-
mance evaluation criterion which takes into consideration both the
thermal efficiency enhancement and the increase in the pressure
drop. Moreover, Huang et al. [118] found that the use of dimples
is better than the use of helical fins and prostrations in the PTC
absorber. They found the performance evaluation criterion of the
dimples case to be between 1.23 and 1.37, for operation with Ther-
minol VP-1. Bellos and Tzivanidis [25] examined the use of inter-
nal fins, twisted tape inserts and perforated plate inserts in evac-

uated and non-evacuated tube collectors. They found that the use
of fins is the best technique according to the thermal, the exergy
and the overall efficiency criteria. The use of twisted tape inserts
is the second choice, while the use of perforated tape inserts is the
less effective technique. The thermal efficiency enhancement with
the evacuated tube collector was found up to 1.5%, while with the
non-evacuated tube collector up to 2%. Practically, the higher ther-
mal losses of the non-evacuated tube collector give greater margin
for thermal enhancement.

The  last  part  of  the  comparative  studies  compares  the  use
of  geometrical  modifications  and  nanofluids  in  PTC.  Bellos  et  al.

that the use of Syltherm 800/CuO leads to 0.76% thermal efficiency

nation of these techniques is the best choice with 1.54% thermal

found that the nanofluids lead to 25% higher pumping work, the
internal  fins  to  100%,  while  the  combination  to  150%.  However,
the pumping work takes low values in all cases and so it is not
an important limitation of the application of the thermal enhance-
ment methods in PTC. Recently, Okonkwo et al. [119] compared the
use of internal fins, converging-diverging tube and twisted tape in-
serts with pure oil and oil/Al
3 . They found that the use of the
converging-diverging  tube  is  the  best  technique  which  enhances
the exergy performance by 0.65% with pure oil and 0.73% with the
nanofluid.

2 O

To sum up, the previous studies indicate that the performance
enhancements of PTC are no so great and they are ranged from
0.5%  to  2%.  The  use  of  dimples,  internal  fins  and  converging-
diverging tube  are  the  most  effective  techniques.  The  nanofluids
lead  to  lower  enhancements  compared  to  the  geometric  modifi-
cations.  The  combination  of  nanofluids  with  geometrical  modifi-
cations seems to be the best technique. About the limitations of
the  examined  studies,  it  is  important  to  state  that  the  pressure
drop  increase  is  something  that  has  to  be  taken  into  considera-
tion. However, it has been found that the higher pumping work
demand due to pressure drop increase is not able to eliminate the
heat transfer enhancement and the overall collector performance
is enhanced with the turbulators and the nanofluids. It is remark-
able that the flow inserts are associated with the highest increases
in the pressure drop. Another limitation of the examined ideas is
the cost increase which is more intense in the nanofluids. More-
over, the nanofluids present extra disadvantages which are associ-
ated with the stability issues, the toxicity, the mechanical and the
chemical erosion. So, the final selection evaluation of the thermal
enhancement techniques has to take into consideration both the
thermal enhancements and the limitations.

5. The use of concentrating thermal PV with parabolic
concentrators

5.1. General approach for the concentrating thermal PV

The thermal PVs are hybrid solar collectors which can produce
simultaneously useful heat and electricity. In these collectors, there
is a heat transfer fluid which removes heat from the PV cell and
produces useful heat. Moreover, this heat transfer fluid acts as a
coolant  and  reduces  the  temperature  of  the  PV  cell  and  so  in-
creases the electrical efficiency of the cell.

It is generally known that the electrical efficiency of the PV cell
( ηPV ) is depended on the cell temperature with an equation as the
below [120] . More specifically, the electrical efficiency of the PV
reduces linearly with the cell temperature increase.

The  reference  temperature  ( η

ref )  is  depended  on  the  PV  cell
type and it takes values close to 15–20%. The temperature depen-
dence coefficient takes small values with the value of 0.005 K −1
to be a typical one [120] . Moreover, it is useful to state that the
reference temperature ( T
ref ) is usually selected at 25 °C and these
results regard a solar irradiation of 10 0 0 W/m 2 .

The use of a concentrator is able to increase the incident so-
lar energy on the PV cell and so higher amounts of electricity to
be produced. However, in concentrating PVs, the use of a coolant
is extremely important in order not to operate at extremely high-
temperature levels. The use of a parabolic shape reflector gives the
opportunity for operating in high concentration ratios and to pro-
duce high electricity amounts with a small PV cell area. This design
is  a  cost-effective  configuration  because  the  higher  cost  regards
the  PV  in  a  system  and  not  the  reflector  material.  In  the  litera-
ture, there are some review papers which investigate concentrating
thermal PV (CPVT) designs [121 –124] . Zhang et al. [121] performed
a review in 2012 for various CPVT designs and they suggested the
use  of  a  compound  parabolic  concentrator  with  a  simple  track-
ing system as the best choice. Sharaf and Orhann [122 , 123] con-
ducted a double-study with many details about the design of the

CPVT. Recently, Kasaeian et al. [124] performed a review about the
parabolic shape concentrator and the linear Fresnel reflectors cou-
pled to PVT. They stated that there is a need for examining exper-
imentally the CPVT in large-scale systems. It is obvious that there
is interest in the area of CPVT and many steps have to be done in
order to commercialize this technology.

5.2. Basic mathematical formulation for concentrating thermal PV

The  basic  mathematical  formulation  about  the  concentrating
thermal PV mainly regards performance efficiency equations. First
of all, the electricity production ( P
el = A PV · C · G
P

el ) can be calculated as below:

b · P F · ηPV

(37)

The (PF) is the packing factor and this parameter is depended
on the design of the concentrating thermal PV . The concentration
ratio ( C ) is depended on the reflector dimensions, as well as the
absorber area.

5.3. Studies with parabolic thermal PV

There are several designs with thermal PV coupled to parabolic
shape concentrators. The most usual design includes a flat absorber
with a PV cell, while there are cooling channels in the back side of
the PV cell. The channel design can be tubular or rectangular, while
there are also other designs with triangular absorbers.

Li et al. [125] studied a parabolic shape concentrator with a flat
PV absorber which is given in Fig. 51 . On the back side of the PV
cell, there is a great tubular channel with internal fins and water as
the working fluid. They found the electrical efficiency to be close
to 10% and the thermal efficiency to be about 50% with GaAs cell
array. Moreover, they found the electrical efficiency to be 7.5% and

the thermal efficiency of 42.5% with a low-cost silicon PV array. In
the previous results, the inlet fluid temperature was 20 °C, while
the outlet was 29.6 °C with the silicon cell and 33.9 °C with the
GaAs cell. Finally, the authors concluded that the suggested tech-
nology  leads  to  the  competitive  cost  of  the  produced  electricity
compared to the conventional flat PV . Karathanasis et al. [126 , 127]
studied a CPVT with a parabolic concentrator and a flat absorber
(see Fig. 52 ). The heat transfer fluid (water) was flowing in rect-
angular channels in the back side of the PV cells. They found 50%
total efficiency which is separated into 44% thermal and 6% elec-
trical efficiency, for low-temperature levels (25–50 °C). They stated
also that the cost of the system is estimated at 1.75 €/W which
is a competitive value compared to other concentrating technolo-
gies. Moreover, the use of a flat PV area with a cover glass has
been studied by Yazdanifard et al. [128] . This design is depicted in
Fig. 53 and it is similar to an inversed thermal PV with a parabolic
concentrator.  They  found  that  the  use  of  glass  is  beneficial  for
the total and the thermal efficiency while it reduces the electri-
cal efficiency. Generally, they found about 7% electrical efficiency,
55% thermal efficiency, 62% total efficiency and 9.6% exergy effi-
ciency for operation at inlet temperature at 25 °C with water/TiO
2
2  nanofluid and
nanofluid. They also studied the use of water/TiO
they found that it is able to enhance the electrical efficiency by
up  to  0.5%  and  the  thermal  efficiency  up  to  4%  in  laminar  flow
regime.  Finally,  they  stated  that  a  preliminary  analysis  indicates
the suggested system to be roughly cost-effective compared to the
conventional flat PV systems. The use of a triangular absorber has
been studied by Calise et al. [129] and the examined configuration
is given in Fig. 54 . They found the electrical, thermal and total effi-
ciencies at 21%, 62%, and 83%, respectively for water inlet temper-
ature equal to 70 °C. Srivastava and Reddy [130] examined various
configurations with PV cells in the outer surface of the absorber
tube, in a conventional PTC (see Fig. 55 ). They also studied the ef-
fect of the nanofluid water/Al
3 on the results. They found that
this collector presents 19% electrical efficiency and 70% thermal ef-
ficiency for inlet temperature equal to 27 °C, while they stated that
the nanofluid enhances the electrical efficiency by 0.6%.

2 O

Moreover, there are extremely alternative designs in the litera-
ture about CPVT. Jiang et al. [131] studied a double stage system,
as it is given in Fig. 56 . They used a secondary parabolic shape
concentrator which reflects partially the solar rays, using a proper
optical filtering. The PV cells are located in the down part of the
main concentrator. They found that the useless heat for the PV cell
can be reduced up to 20.7%, while totally there is a 10% increase in
the utilized solar energy by the receiver. They also stated that the
optical efficiency of the system was 76.4%. Stanley et al. [132] stud-
ied a double-pass absorber in a CPVT system. The absorber is de-

picted in Fig. 57 and there are two tubes; the upper for the cold
stream (water) and the down for the hot stream (propylene gly-
col). The advantage of this design is the possibility for operation at
higher temperature levels compared to the other systems. This sys-
tem presents a relatively low electrical efficiency up to 5%, while
the thermal efficiency is close to 50% for temperature levels up to
120 °C. They also stated that the examined design presents a high
cost and there is a need for conducting more work on reducing the
production cost. Widyolar et al. [133] investigated a double stage

CPVT with a primary parabolic concentrator and a secondary com-
pound parabolic concentrator. The greater part of the secondary re-
flector gas PV cells and the total system is given in Fig. 58 . They
found that this design is able to produce 8% electrical efficiency
and 37% thermal efficiency at 365 °C with Therminol VP-1.

The previous studies indicate that relatively high electrical and
thermal efficiencies can be achieved with the CPVT. Table 7 sum-
marizes briefly all these studies. It is useful to state that the al-
ternative  designs  of  refs  [129 , 130]  give  high  electrical  efficien-

Refs [132 , 133] give high thermal efficiency at medium and high-
temperature  levels.  So,  it  is  obvious  that  the  field  of  CPVT  with
parabolic concentrators is open and there are numerous interest-
ing ideas that can be improved and studied in the future.

6. Discussion

The discussion section is devoted to presenting the advantages
and the limitations of the examined designs and to discuss them in
a more comparative way. Also, the most promising ideas are high-
lighted. Finally, the environmental effects of the alternative, as well
as the future challenges which regard their utilization are given.

6.1. Performance discussion of the examined studies

In this work, numerous alternative designs and ideas about the
PTC are given. The main goals of the alternative collectors are listed
below:

• Increase of the thermal efficiency of the solar collector in order

to achieve higher useful heat production.

• Increase of the optical efficiency in order to increase the ab-

sorbed solar irradiation in the absorber.

• Decrease in the manufacturing cost in order to create more vi-

able systems.

• Create uniform heat flux distribution over the absorber in or-
der to reduce the hot spots and to enhance the thermal perfor-
mance.

• Reduce  the  temperature  deviation  in  the  absorber  periphery
and so the thermal stresses are reduced. This fact eliminates
the possibilities for failure of the absorber.

• Create more compact systems which can be used in applica-

tions with space limitations.

• Better performance with greater tracking errors in order to re-
duce the need for highly precise tracking systems with a high
cost.

• Operation at higher temperature levels in order to use the solar

systems in applications with higher temperature needs.

• Increase of the overall performance of the systems with thermal

and electrical production (cogeneration systems).

The previous goals can be achieved in different ways and the
field is open; for new and different ideas. In this work, the exam-
ined collectors are separated into three main categories: the op-
tically new design, the thermally new designs and the alternative
concentrating thermal PV.

6.1.1. Discussion of optically modified designs

The optical modification ideas aim to increase the optical per-
formance of the proposed designs. Zhu et al. [38] suggested the
movement of the receiver in order to reduce the end losses, while
Qu et al. [43] suggested the rotation of the solar field in order to
eliminate the optical losses due to the sun position. The receiver
movement with a secondary reflector and a non-continuous pri-
mary absorber (Ref. [38] ) leads to an acceptable thermal efficiency
at  66%  while  the  total  configuration  faces  low  mechanical  diffi-
culties due to the reduced wind loads. Moreover, the idea of Ref.
[43] seems to be interesting with a 5% increase in the daily per-
formance but it has to be tested in greater solar fields than the
300 kW. Another promising idea for reducing the land utilization
and given a more compact system is the use of lenses. This idea
has been examined by Ma et al. [42] and it is able to give an op-
tical  efficiency  of  84%, higher than the  conventional PTCs  which
have about 75%. Maatallah et al. [41] suggested a stationary con-
centrator with a moving receiver and they stated that this system
is a low-cost design with acceptable efficiency, especially close to
the solar noon. However, this design is not favorable in cases with
high thermal efficiency needs.

The use of secondary reflectors in PTC has been examined by
many researchers. The goals of this technique are to capture the
lost  solar  rays,  to  create  a  more  uniform  heat  flux  over  the  ab-
sorber and to create a higher concentration ratio if it is needed.
Widyolar et al. [44] used a compound parabolic secondary reflector
which is able to operate at 375 °C with a thermal efficiency of 37%.
Moreover, Wang et al. [45] used a similar idea for creating uniform
heat flux over the absorber periphery. In the same direction, Wirz
et al. [48] examined different secondary designs and they found
that the thermal efficiency can be enhanced by up to 2.7% with a
secondary reflector. Another interesting and new idea is the use of
PTC for lighting purposes in a building which can reduce the elec-
tricity consumption for lighting up to 90% [49 , 50] .

The previous brief summary of the optical modification stud-
ies  indicates  that  the  use  of  secondary  reflectors  seems  to  be  a
promising idea for operation in high temperatures and for increas-
ing the thermal performance of the PTC. Furthermore, the use of
lenses [42] is an interesting concept leading to compact designs.
Also, the use of a rotating tracking system [43] increases the daily
yield because the system follows the sun in a more suitable way.
Important enhancements have been found in the optical efficiency
and this fact is the most important indicator for the application of
these technologies. However, it is important to take into consider-
ation the higher investment cost and the manufacturing difficulties
in the optically improved systems.

6.1.2. Discussion of thermally modified designs

6.1.3. Discussion of concentrating thermal PV designs

111

The first part of the studies about thermally modified absorbers
regards ideas for reducing the thermal losses of the receiver. Chan-
dra et al. [52] found the use of an insulation material in the evac-
uated tube is able to reduce the thermal losses about 20%, while
Wang et al. [54] found that the use of a radiation shield reduces
the thermal losses about 24%. Moreover, Yang et al. [55] stated that
31% thermal loss reduction can be achieved with the use of double
coating in the absorber surface. At this point is essential to state
that the high quality evacuated tubes have a high cost, so the use
of an alternative receiver is a key factor in the development of low-
cost systems.

One interesting idea is the use of a V-shape receiver [59] with
insulation in order not to use the high cost evacuated tubes. Fur-
thermore, a low-cost design with a light-weight structure has been
suggested  by  Forman  et  al.  [63] .  In  this  work,  two  independent
parts are merged into a light-weight and solid system. Other in-
teresting ideas are associated with a special design of a solar air
collector which has been studied in Refs. [61 , 62] with details. This
design is able to operate efficiently in temperatures over 500 °C.
The use of thermal batteries [64 , 65] is an alternative idea which
has to be investigated more in the future.

About the flow enhancements methods, the use of turbulators
has been found to be more efficient than the use of nanofluids. The
studies of Bellos et al. [10] and Okonkwo et al. [119] clearly state
the above argument. Moreover, it is essential to state that the com-
bination of both techniques (turbulators and nanofluids) is the best
way of maximizing the heat transfer rates from the absorber to the
working fluid [10] . However, the use of turbulators leads to higher
pressure drop than the nanofluids which is a point that has to be
taken into consideration in any design process. Among the turbula-
tors, the use of internal fins [78] , dimples in the absorber [82] and
the converging-diverging inner absorber surface [83] seem to be
the most effective choices. About the nanofluids, the use of Cu/CuO
nanoparticles [87 , 92] , the use of Al
3 [89 , 93] , as well as the use
of MWCNT [97] seem to be the most efficient choices.

2 O

Finally, it can be said that all the thermal enhancement tech-
niques can improve the performance of the PTC but they lead to
higher  investment  cost.  The  uses  of  flow  modifications  (inserts,
fins, dimpled absorber) are most efficient techniques than the use
of nanofluids. The combination of both techniques is the superior
choice  but  this  fact  has  to  be  checked  with  real  installations  in
great  solar  fields.  The  nanofluids  are  also  associated  with  many
problems such as the high cost and the stability issues due to ag-
glomeration, as well as erosion issues. On the other hand, the flow
modifications lead to higher pressure drop compared to pressure
drop in nanofluid cases. However, the evaluation criteria indicate
that this pressure drop is not so important in energy terms. Lastly,
it has to be said that the use of flow inserts and the use of nanoflu-
ids can be applied in the existing systems, while the use of mod-
ified absorber geometries (e.g., internally finned absorber) can be
used only to new systems. So, the use of the flow inserts or of the
nanofluids can be applied for retrofitting the existing systems.

A  comparison  between  the  thermal  and  the  optical  enhance-
ment methods indicates that the optical studies may have a higher
potential because the PTC faces higher optical than thermal losses.
A typical PTC presents a performance of 65% which means 25% op-
tical losses and 10% thermal losses. The thermal enhancement mar-
gin is higher in the optical losses because they are generally more
than the thermal ones. So, the optical enhancement gives a higher
potential for improvement. However, the commercial systems use
highly  precise  tracking  systems  and  material  with  good  optical
properties (transmittance, absorbance and reflectance). These facts
make the optical improvement to be a more difficult concept than
the thermal improvements.

The use of concentrating thermal PV is an interesting idea for
the production of high amounts of electricity and useful heat (co-
generation  systems).  The  use  of  a  heat  transfer  fluid  for  the  PV
cell cooling is vital in concentrating systems because of the high
amounts of the incident solar energy on the PV cells. It has been
found that the use of flat absorbers is able to give an electrical
efficiency of 7–8% [125 –128] , while the use of a triangular about
20% [129 , 130] . It has been also proved that the use of nanofluids
is  able  to  give  a  small  electrical  efficiency  enhancement  of  0.5%
[128 , 130] . Moreover, the study of Stanley et al. [132] suggested an
interesting double-pass absorber which can operate at 120 °C with
5% electrical efficiency and 50% thermal efficiency. Widyolar et al.
[133]  found  that  a  double  stage  system  is  able  to  operate  with
8% electrical efficiency and 37% thermal efficiency at 365 °C. These
results prove that the operation at medium-high temperatures is
achievable with the alternative designs.

The previous results show that there is great potential for de-
signing efficient systems with the use of concentrating thermal PV
and parabolic concentrators. Especially the triangular design gives
extremely high potentials because of the increased electrical effi-
ciencies. In the future, the study of large-scale concentrating ther-
mal PV is a key factor for the establishment and the commercial-
ization  of  these  systems.  Lastly,  it  is  important  to  establish  the
proper legislation in order to face the concentrating thermal pho-
tovoltaic as cogeneration systems and to ensure the proper elec-
tricity price tariff.

6.2. Financial discussion of the examined ideas

The financial evaluation of the alternative PTC designs is an im-
portant issue in order to check the viability of the examined cases.
Practically, the increase in the income due to the enhanced per-
formance has to be evaluated together with the possible increase
of the investment cost in order to check if the new designs are
beneficial in an overall evaluation. However, in the present studies,
there are only a few aspects of the financial viability of the exam-
ined designs. Below, a summary of the most important conclusions
about the financial point of view of some alternative designs are
given.

Maatallah  et  al.  [41]  stated  that  the  use  of  a  stationary  con-
centrator is able to reduce a lot the total cost of the system and
this is an encouraging result. Moreover, Chandra et al. [52] found
that the use of insulation inside the absorber tube is able to cre-
ate a receiver with 20% lower cost, compared to the conventional
evacuated tube. The authors of the previous ideas stated that these
designs are promising ideas for the development of low-cost PTC
with a reasonable performance.

Yang et al. [55] stated that the use of a double-coating absorber
tube leads to a 5% decrease in the LCOE. The use of a nanofluid-
based  PTC  coupled  with  a  Rankine  cycle  has  been  found  to  re-
duce  about  1%  of  the  LCOE,  according  to  the  study  of  Alashkar
and Gadalla [111] . About the power plants, Munoz and Abanades
[80] stated that the helical fins in the inside absorber surface lead
to 2% power plant electricity production, while the increase of the
investment  cost  of  the  plant  is  estimated  to  0.5%.  So,  they  con-
cluded that the overall financial performance of the system is ben-
eficial with the internal fins. Bellos and Tzivanidis [71] calculated
lower thermal stresses with a star flow insert in a PTC and they
concluded that this fact is able to reduce the failure rate of the ab-
sorbers and so to reduce their replacement cost. About the use of
nanofluids, Kasaeian et al. [96] found that the use of oil/MWCNT
leads  to  a  payback  period  of  about  4  years  which  a  promising
value. About the CPVT, Karathanasis et al. [126] found that the use
of a parabolic concentrator with a flat PVT receiver presents a sys-
tem cost competitive with other solar concentrating antagonists.

The previous summary indicates that the found financial data in
the literature are promising and they indicate the viability of the
examined idea. Especially the use of helical fins [80] and of the
nanofluid utilization [96,111] leads to the most promising results.
Moreover, the use of a double-coating absorber leads to 5% lower
LCOE, an interesting result about this design. In any case, extra ad-
vantages of alternative designs such as the lower thermal stresses
in the absorber [71] can increase the overall impact of the thermal
enhancement methods in PTC.

6.3. Challenges and environmental benefits

It has been proved that alternative designs present important
efficiency advantages, as well as some of them, can reduce the cost
of  solar  systems.  However,  it  is  essential  to  discuss  the  possible
environmental benefits of these alternative designs, as well as their
challenges.

First of all, it has to be stated that the increase in the thermal
efficiency is able to produce higher amounts of useful heat pro-
duction (or electricity with CPVT) and so higher amounts of fossil
fuels can be substituted. This fact has a direct environmental ef-
2 emissions. Moreover, the more
fect with the reduction of the CO
efficient systems are able to reduce the demanded collecting aper-
ture, especially in the higher solar field. This fact makes possible
the reduction of land utilization, important issues especially for lo-
cations with land restrictions (for instance overpopulated cities). It
is also useful to state that the cost reduction of the alternative PTC
will lead to more investments in solar thermal systems and con-
sequently to more green energy production. Another advantage of
the alternative designs is associated with the lower material uti-
lization which leads to lower cost and to lower need for a lower
number of processes about the PTC construction. So, the total life
cycle of the PTC can make them a more environmentally friendly
technology.

However,  the  alternative  ideas  are  conjugated  with  possible
problems which are associated with the complexity and the relia-
bility of the new systems. A lot of work has to be performed before
the alternative designs to be commercially ready and many experi-
ments and durability tests are a need in this direction. Moreover, it
is important to take into consideration the increase of investment
cost through the use of the alternative technique and to evaluate it
properly. The cost-effective choices have to be determined in order
to be commercialized on a great scale.

Moreover, about the challenges of the alternative designs, it can
be said that all the ideas about the flow enhancements (inserts,
flow turbulators, nanofluids, etc.) lead to higher pressure drop and
consequently to increased pumping work demand. The result is the
increased operating cost because of the higher consumption in the
pumping system, as well as an increase in the installation cost of
the hydraulic circuit. However, it has been found that the increase
of the pumping work is not so important and this fact makes this
limitation not an obstacle in the utilization of the flow enhance-
ment methods. About the nanofluid utilization, the limitation and
the problems in these cases are more because of the high cost of
these fluids and the stability problems due to nanoparticle agglom-
erations  [134] .  Furthermore,  there  are  problems  with  the  power
deposition in the gas-phase nanofluids according to the Ref. [107] .

6.4. Future work

There is a need for conducting future works about the estab-
lishment of the most efficient alternative designs. The experimen-
tal studies are needed in order to determine the performance en-
hancement  and  to  examine  the  durability  of  the  alternative  de-
signs.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  need  for  experimental  work  with
large-scale systems in order to estimate the real enhancement in

the scale of real solar fields. This technique is able to make the
alternative designs more attractive for investments. Especially for
the use of turbulators in the PTC, the majority of the studies are
CFD work or thermal models are used. So, it would be critical to
measure experimentally the thermal enhancement with the use of
flow inserts, internal fins and of the similar techniques.

Additionally,  there  is  a  need  for  future  comparative  works
which will examine different alternative designs under the same
operating  conditions  and  with  a  respective  methodology.  These
studies  are  able  to  compare  properly  the  different  designs  (or
ideas) and to give reliable conclusions. In this direction, there are
some studies in the literature, mainly about the flow enhancement
methods. However, there is a need for more comparative studies.
An  interesting idea on  this issue would  be the  establishment of
standard methods about the way of conducting comparative stud-
ies with simulations or experiments. Some reference cases could
be agreed and in order for the found results to be properly com-
pared. So, the results of different studies could be easily compared
and combined.

Another remark about the future work is associated with the
combination of optically and thermally modification methods. It is
obvious that the combination of more enhancement techniques is
able to create extremely high efficient and compact systems. Espe-
cially in the cases with operation in high-temperature levels, the
combinations  of  optical  and  thermal  modifications  can  be  really
important in order to develop systems which can compete for the
fuel and well-established technologies.

The cost analysis of the various alternative designs is critical in
order to evaluate the viability of these ideas. The cost analysis has
to be conducted about the investment cost and the operation cost
in order to assess the life economic cycle.  Furthermore, there is
a need for highlighting the possible manufacturing difficulties in
intelligent designs because in many cases the efficiency increase is
conjugated with various technological restrictions.

7. Conclusions

The parabolic trough solar collector is one of the most mature
solar concentrating technologies for operation in medium and high
temperatures. The objective of the review article is to present and
to discuss alternative parabolic trough designs which can lead to
more sustainable configurations. The examined alternative designs
of this work are separated into three categories; the optically mod-
ified systems, the thermally modified systems and the concentrat-
ing thermal photovoltaics. Various ideas have been studied in the
literature and the main goals of these ideas to enhance the ther-
mal performance, to operate at higher temperature levels and to
design cost-effective systems. The most important conclusions of
this work are summarized below:

• The optical modifications of the PTC are able to increase the
concentration ratio and to give the possibility for operation at
higher operating temperatures. The use of a secondary reflector
is a promising choice which can help to achieve these goals.
Various secondary designs such as trapezoidal, flat and with a
parabolic shape have been tested. Moreover, the use of lenses
leads to more compact designs.

• The improvements in the collector tracking systems and the op-
tical efficiency enhancements are able to increase the daily en-
ergy yield of the PTC solar field about 5%.

• The thermal modifications of the PTC are able to enhance the
thermal  performance  and  to  increase  the  useful  output.  The
thermal enhancements are usually low (up to 2%) because of
the low thermal losses of the conventional PTC with an evacu-
ated receiver which gives small thermal enhancement margin.

• The use of alternative receivers with insulation, radiation shield
or  double  coating  are  promising  choices  for  designs  low-cost
systems with satisfying performance. Especially the use of in-
sulation in the upper part of the absorber reduces the receiver
cost about 20%.

• The use of internally helical fins in the absorber and the use
of nanofluids are found to be the most promising choices fi-
nancially. More specifically, the use of nanofluids can lead to a
payback period of about 4 years. Also, the use of the double-
coating is an idea which can reduce the LCOE by 5%.

• The use of turbulators is a more efficient technique than the
use  of  nanofluids  for  enhancing  the  thermal  performance  of
PTC. Especially, the use of internal fins, absorber with dimples
or a converging-diverging absorber tube seems to be the most
ideal choices. Moreover, the nanofluids with Cu/CuO, Al
3 and
MWCNT nanoparticles seem to be the best solutions.

• There is a need for conducting research on the ways of restrict-
ing  the  limitations  of  the  various  technologies.  Especially  for
the  nanofluids, it is  important to  reduce the  investment cost
and to create more stable working fluids, especially at higher
temperature levels. The problems of the toxicity and the ero-
sion have also to be studied.

• The optical modification methods are generally more effective
than  the  thermal  modification  methods  because  the  optical
losses are generally greater than the thermal losses in PTC. So,
there is a higher performance enhancement margin with the
optical improvement than the thermal. However, the thermal
enhancement methods can be more important in cases of oper-
ation at high-temperature levels.

• The concentrating thermal PV are promising alternative choices
for producing high electricity amounts and important amounts
of  useful  heat.  Alternative  designs  with  triangular  absorber,
double  stage  concentrators  or  special  double-pass  absorbers
give the opportunity to produce useful heat at medium temper-
ature levels with simultaneous electricity production and to de-
velop highly efficient cogeneration systems. These systems are
able to achieve high electrical efficiencies close to 20%.

The conclusions of this work can be used as guidelines for fu-
ture studies and projects on the domain of alternative PTC designs.
There is a need for more experimental and comparative studies not
only in laboratory scale but also in real solar fields. Furthermore,
there is a need for cost analysis studies in order to find in which
cases the thermal efficiency increase is enough to cover the invest-
ment cost increase.

Appendix A. Basic modeling of nanofluids

The thermal properties of the nanofluid are calculated by mod-
ifying the respective thermal properties of the base fluid. The most
important thermal properties for the solar thermal system calcula-
tions are the thermal conductivity ( k ), the dynamic viscosity ( μ),
the density ( ρ) and the specific heat capacity ( c p ). In the litera-
ture, there are numerous studies which present many models for
the nanofluid thermal properties, especially for the dynamic vis-
cosity and the thermal conductivity [135–138] . The reason for this
great variety is based on the dependency of the nanofluid thermal
properties by numerous parameters as the nanoparticle concentra-
tion, the nanoparticle diameter, the preparation temperature and
the nanoparticle shape.

The given equations are applicable both in water and oil-based
nanofluids and they are usually applied in the literature studies.

The nanofluid is symbolized with ( nf ), the base fluid with ( bf ) and
the nanoparticle with ( np ). The volumetric concentration is ( φ) of
the  nanoparticle  to  the  nanofluid  is  an  important  parameter.  It
takes values up to 8%, but in the majority of studies, it has values
up to 2%. The thermal properties of the most usual nanoparticles
are given in Table A1 [9] .

The density ( ρ) of the nanofluid is calculated as [139] :

n f = φ · ρnp + ( 1 − φ ) · ρ

The specific heat capacity ( c p ) is calculated according to the fol-

lowing equation [135] :

In the previous equation, an important parameter is the ratio
of the nano-layer thickness to the original particle radius ( β). This
parameter can be taken equal to 0.1, according to the Ref. [141] .

The nanofluid dynamic viscosity ( μ) is usually estimated using
the Bachelor model [142] . It is important to state that this equation
is a theoretical formula which underestimates the dynamic viscos-
ity at higher concentrations and thus it usually applied for concen-
trations up to 4%.

PTC usually operates with thermal oils and thus the emphasis
is given in oil-based nanofluids. Fig. A1 [9] illustrates the thermal
properties of various oil-based nanofluids with Syltherm 800 as a
base fluid and CuO, Al
2 and Cu nanoparticles. This figure
shows the specific heat capacity, the density and the thermal con-
ductivity of these nanofluids for different tem perature levels and
volumetric concentrations. It is important to state that the density
and the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid are higher than the
base fluid. On the other hand, there is a reduction in the specific
heat capacity for the nanofluid. Moreover, Fig. A2 [10] shows that
the dynamic viscosity of the nanofluid is higher than the base fluid
for all the temperature levels. The main advantage of the nanoflu-
ids is the increase in thermal conductivity which leads to higher
heat transfer coefficients between the absorber and the heat trans-
fer fluid. The increased viscosity leads to a higher pressure drop
and it is a limitation that has to be taken into account in any case.
