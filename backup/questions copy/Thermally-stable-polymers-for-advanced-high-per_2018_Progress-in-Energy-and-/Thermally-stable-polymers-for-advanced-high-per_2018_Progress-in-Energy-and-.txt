Polymeric membranes can be used for the energy-efficient and low-cost gas separation. However, their
inability to resist high temperatures limits their use in certain industries. Some polymer membranes can be
operated at some levels of the unpleasant environments, but the energy- and cost-efficiencies are offset by
the necessity to severely cool hot streams. In many cases, such implementation is impossible or altogether
impractical. Therefore, numerous studies have been focused on modifying polymers to create synthetic
polymeric membranes which survive at high temperatures. Polymer scientists introduced many thermally
stable polymers mostly based on carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic polymers, which exhibit enhanced
thermal stability. However, the major problem with these polymers is their low processability, which is
mainly due to their insolubility or high phase transition temperatures. So far, there has been little success in
processing the high-temperature-resistant polymers to make membranes with acceptable separation and
performance characteristics. The aim of this study is to review efforts which have been made to produce
high-performance polymeric membranes with a focus on the preparation procedure; whereby, the main
limitations and challenges to be faced were explored. The key factors discussed include the type of polymer,
membrane preparation method, thermal analysis results and application of the prepared membranes. The
primary purpose of this review is to lay out the basics for selecting polymer, solvent, additives and the
appropriate preparation method to produce thermally stable polymeric membranes for gas separation. The
future direction of research and development to fully exploit the potential usage of thermally stable poly-
meric membranes to achieve commercially viable processes was also shown.

1. Introduction

PIn recent years, membrane gas separation (GS) technology has
become one of the fastest emerging technologies due to their dis-
tinct advantages over conventional techniques (mainly absorption
by amines). In particular, membrane GS exhibits operational flexibil-
ity, easy scale-up, low operating costs, compact design, and high
product quality [1(cid:1)8]. One of the most important applications of
membrane GS is to capture and recover CO2 from gas streams. The
concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has been
increasing significantly over the past century. The average concen-
tration of CO2 in 2015 was 399 ppm which was about 40% higher
than that in the mid-1800 s. The CO2 emission has been intensified
in the last decade with an average growth of 2 ppm/year [9]. This
intense upward trend is primarily attributed to the growing world-
wide energy demand from fossil fuels. The industrial sector is
responsible for one-third of all the energy utilized globally and for
almost 40% of CO2 emissions [10]. Given the significant effect of
greenhouse gas (CO2 as the main component) emission on climate
change and global warming, capture, and recovery of CO2 has
become a global issue [11(cid:1)13].

PThere are several different types of membrane materials such inor-
ganic materials (ceramics, metals, zeolites, carbons), organic materials
(rubbery, glassy, and polymer blends) and porous hybrid materials
(metal-organic framework (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks
(ZIFs)). Due to the high cost of inorganic membranes and porous
hybrid materials [14,15], and their modularizing problem, numerous
studies have been focused on modifying polymers to create synthetic
polymeric membranes which survive at elevated temperatures. The
polymer membranes are inexpensive and simply manufactured into
large-scale modules. Treatment of gas streams using polymeric mem-
branes has, therefore, become a common practice in many industries
[16]. However, the major limitation of the current polymeric materials
is their relative lack of tolerance to high temperatures. Many hot gas
streams in all chemical industries must remain at high temperature
during GS process. Many of these streams cannot be subjected to
membrane-based separation processes. In some applications, the pro-
cess streams are cooled solely to accommodate a membrane GS pro-
cess, after which are heated back. This cooling followed by re-heating
causes the waste of a considerable amount of energy [17].

PResearch in thermally stable polymers started in 1950 when car-
bocyclic and heterocyclic polymers were first discovered and the
ability of the polymers to withstand high temperature was discov-
ered [18]. Thermal stability of a polymer is variously defined as:

P- Maintenance of the chemical characteristics of the polymer
“above 300°C by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) in air” [19],
or,

P- Maintenance of physical properties for long periods of time “at
280°C in air measured by Instrumental Gas Analysis (IGA) [19].”

PThese definitions could be construed as vague by some research-
ers, because the stability is subjectively defined in terms of a tem-
perature where the polymer
chemically denatures without
specifying the period of operation, and the mechanisms for loss of
thermal properties (deterioration) are not exactly addressed. The
thermal stability of many “heat-resistant” polymers is also fre-
quently described by such terms as “good” or “high” without

Pquantification. These statements raise questions, such as, what is the
environment at which the stability should be studied? How long is
the polymer stable at a specific temperature in different environ-
ments? At what temperature does the polymer become unstable?
What is the role of pressure or stress in addition to temperature?
From a practical standpoint, thermal stability is the temperature or
temperature range that a material can withstand and still retain use-
ful properties in a given application [20]. This practical viewpoint is
perhaps more useful for defining thermally stable membranes. In
fact, for testing the suitability of membranes as filtration media at
high temperatures, the membrane should be tested at high tempera-
tures in a specific application for a long period instead of focusing on
thermal analysis results.

PIn addition to stability, at least two other key factors exist that
enter in the recipe for the success of high-temperature-resistant
membranes. These are shown in Fig. 1 as the unification challenge.
The concept of thermally stable membranes, developed by specialty
polymers, involves three critical factors which determine their ulti-
mate utility: stability, durability, and processability. The analysis of
the long-term performance of membranes confirms the reliability of
operation and the process sustainability. Failure analysis can be used
as a tool to identify process sustainability and to develop actions to
prevent failure occurrence. The first step is to know the membrane
failure criteria which entirely depend on the application require-
ments. Generally, membranes must undergo a long-term operation
at elevated temperatures and demonstrate quite a favorable trade-
off relationship between selectivity and permeability [20].

PWithout getting into the mathematics, the reliability of a poly-
meric membrane is defined as a measure of the chance that the
membrane will last long enough to perform the separation. In fact, it
is a measure of the probability of remaining in-service to a certain
point in time. Reliability of membrane can be affected by small
changes in membrane material properties.

PThe primary challenge in the preparation of membranes from
stable polymers is the difficulty in processing, as these polymers
have a very low solubility in common solvents. In fact, there is an
inverse relation between stability and tractability. Therefore, the

Psearch for new and better solvents is the first strategy to solve this
problem. To increase the solubility of
these polymers some
approaches have been used:

P1. Using aprotic polar solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP), N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and N, N-Dimethylace-
tamide (DMAc). The prediction of polymer solubility in a solvent
is typically made by comparing the solubility parameters of the
two components. According to the Flory(cid:1)Huggins theory, the
polymer/solvent interaction increases as their solubility param-
eter difference decreases [21,22]. For example, the solubility
parameter of NMP and PES are 18.0 and 17.6, respectively, which
leads to the high miscibility of these two materials [22].

P2. The addition of inorganic salts such as CaCl2 or LiCl to the sol-
vents mentioned above. The strong Lewis acid character of these
salts results in a tight binding of the cation (e.g., Liþ) to the sol-
vent carbonyl group (e.g., in DMAc and DMF); thereby, leaving
the Cl¡ ion free to form hydrogen bond in the solution (e.g., with
the N -H protons of the polyamide). In fact, the solution mecha-
nism involves the complexation of the cation with the solvent to
produce macro-cations, e.g., [Li-DMAc]þ, that leaves the anion
free for a strong hydrogen bonding [23,24].

P3. Using strong mineral acids, such as hydrogen fluoride, trifluoro-
methane, sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid. However, the use of
such corrosive solvents causes additional problems like degra-
dation of the polymer or adding undesired functional groups to
the polymer matrix [25].

P4. Dissolving the polymer at high temperature (thermal phase
inversion). In this method, a polymer is dissolved at high tem-
perature in a solvent, the solution is cooled to precipitate the
polymer as a formed membrane, and the solvent is then
removed [25]. The thermal phase inversion process allows fabri-
cation of various types of membranes, from an aromatic polymer
containing in-chain ether or thioether and ketone linkages such
as polyetherketone (PEK), polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and pol-
yethersulfone (PES) [25].

PConsiderable progress has been made toward the development of
novel polymeric materials that can form high-temperature tolerant
membranes. Such efforts have focused on increasing the thermal
and chemical stability of the existing polymeric materials or chang-
ing the chemical structure of the polymers to produce novel, ther-
mally stable variants. Several approaches are in vogue, including i)
blending different polymers, ii) crosslinking the polymer matrix, iii)
introducing inorganic particles into the polymer matrix to produce
mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), iv) increasing the molecular
weight of polymers. Although these methods are beneficial for
increasing the stability of membranes, the improvement in thermal
stability is not significant since the fundamental building block of
the polymer is not modified. Modifying the building block of the
polymer has led to the development of heat-resistant polymers [26].
PIn the recent past, there has been an increasing effort toward
processing of heat resistant polymers into thermally stable mem-
branes for GS. This paper will review the research conducted on the
preparation of high-temperature-resistant polymeric membranes
with the aim of addressing the following topics:

P1. The need for developing membrane that can operate at high

temperatures,

P2. Relating thermal stability to the polymer chemistry and molecu-
lar structure, and classification of thermally stable polymers,
P3. Methods used to produce thermally stable membranes, includ-
ing phase inversion, interfacial (in-situ) polymerization reaction,
solution evaporation, etc. [27],

P4. Methods to resolve the processability problems of heat resistant

polymers in GS,

P5. The thermal analysis techniques used to characterize the mem-

branes that are produced,

P6. GS applications for these thermally resistant membranes,
P7. The future direction of research and development in the area of

GS.

PThis paper has been divided into three parts. The first part deals
with identification and clarification of the reasons for using high-
temperature-resistant polymeric membranes and the theoretical
aspects of heat-resistant polymers. In the second part, research on
this subject is critically reviewed to find out the most promising and
conceptually sound directions toward preparation and characteriza-
tion of high-temperature-tolerant polymeric membranes for GS.
Finally, in the last section, potential future developments in produc-
ing thermally stable polymeric membranes are discussed.

PThe review describes a high impact literature survey on the
fabrication and application of GS membranes that involves several
disciplines including material science, energy systems, polymer
chemistry, and transport phenomena in non-porous media. GS is
certainly of a great interest in the context of energy, and so are
high-temperature membranes. Therefore, this review is especially
devoted to providing evidence for the effectiveness of state-of-the-
art technologies for preparing high-performance polymeric mem-
branes. A rather comprehensive in-depth study was carried out to
investigate various modification approaches that would be beneficial
to operate polymeric membrane at extreme conditions, particularly
at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the physicochemical proper-
ties of the applied polymers appeal to the polymer science commu-
nity by addressing the production methods of high-performance GS
membranes with enhanced permeation and thermal properties.

2. Effect of temperature on gas transport through membranes

PThe mechanism of gas transport

through dense polymeric
membranes is described using the solution ¡ diffusion model. This
mechanism considers that gas sorption is as significant as gas diffu-
sion in dense membranes. The main steps in gas transport by solu-
tion-diffusion mechanism are: 1) dissolving of gas molecules at the
upstream, 2) diffusion through the membrane, and 3) desorption at
the downstream [21,28,29]. Transport of smaller gas molecules is
primarily governed by diffusion, while for larger and more con-
densable molecules it is controlled by sorption. Assuming negligible
downstream pressure (usually atmospheric pressure) as compared
to the upstream pressure, the following simple expression can be
written for the transport of a gas A through the membranes by
solution ¡ diffusion mechanism:
PA 1⁄4 SA DA

ð1Þ
PIdeal selectivity of component A over B is the ratio of the perme-
ability coefficients for pure A and B gases that are measured under
similar transmembrane pressure [30,31]:

where P, D, and S are membrane permeability, diffusivity, and solu-
bility, respectively. The diffusion of gas molecules in a dense mem-
brane is a thermally activated process and is described by the
Arrhenius equation:

where EDA is the activation energy of diffusion, R is the universal gas
constant, T is the absolute temperature, and D0A is the pre-exponen-
tial factor. Considering the functional relationship between the pre-
exponential factor and the activation energy ( ln D0A 1⁄4 aEDA=RT (cid:1)b)

where c and f are constants that are dependent on the polymer type,
and a and b are constants that are independent of gas type. The value
of a is 0.64 and is independent of polymer type. The value of b is 9.2
for rubbery and 11.5 for glassy polymers. The parameter c is, in fact,
a measure of the sensitivity of activation energy, and thus the diffu-
sion coefficient, to penetrant size. More polymer chain flexibility
results in lower values of c, whereas more rigid structures, primarily
related to glassy materials, lead to higher values of c. The parameter
f characterizes the minimum penetrant size that enables diffusion
through a particular polymer without requiring any activation
energy. The value of f ranges from 0 for rubbery polymers to
14,000 cal/mol for rigid glassy polymers like polyimide [32].

PBased on Eqs. 3 and 4, increasing the temperature significantly
increases the diffusion of gas molecules through the membrane. The
sensitivity of this correlation depends on the value of activation
energy and thus the size of the penetrants and the type of the poly-
mer. Temperature variations have a more significant impact on the
diffusion of smaller size molecules in more rigid structures, corre-
sponding to the more powerful size-sieving capability of glassy
materials, than that of larger molecules in rubbery polymers.

PThe influence of temperature on solubility is typically written in

terms of van't Hoff relationship:
DHs
RT

(cid:1)
SA 1⁄4 S0A exp (cid:1)

(cid:3)

ð5Þ

where S0A is the preexponential factor and DHs is the partial molar
enthalpy of sorption and is strongly related to the Lennard(cid:1)Jones
temperature (eA/k) of the gas (DHs=R 1⁄4 500(cid:1)10ɛA=k, mainly for
glassy polymers). For weak interactions between gas molecules and
polymers, e.g., the solubility of low molecular weight or less con-
densable gases, the change in the enthalpy of mixing is positive
(DHs > 0). This results in an increase in the gas solubility with an
increase in the temperature. For the condensable gases and vapors,
the enthalpy change is negative (DHs < 0), thereby showing a
decrease in solubility by increasing temperature. In general, gas
solubility correlates well with its condensability. Considering the
typical linear relationship between ln SA and Lennard(cid:1)Jones tem-
perature, as a measure of condensability, (ln SA D M þ NeA/k) [33] the
following expression is obtained for penetrant solubility as a func-
tion of temperature [32]:

ln SA 1⁄4 M þ NɛA=k(cid:1) 500(cid:1)10ɛA=k

where M and N are constants. The value of N is 0.023 and is insensi-
tive to the polymer chemical structure. The value of M, however,
depends on polymer structure and polymer(cid:1)penetrant interactions.
The values of eA/k for all gases is available in the literature [32]. Using
the above equation, the temperature-dependent permeability of a
gas component and its ideal selectivity over other gases can be
obtained.

PGiven the above, for the smaller gas molecules, both solubility
and diffusivity increase by enhancing temperature that leads to an
increase in gas permeability. In the case of larger molecules, how-
ever, a slight increase in the diffusivity at elevated temperatures is
compromised with a decrease in the solubility, which results in a
significant reduction in the permeation of more condensable gases
through the membrane. The change in the ideal selectivity highly
depends on the size and solubility of gases. When one component is
smaller, and at the same time, more soluble than the other one (e.g.,
O2 over N2 or CO2 over CH4), both solubility and diffusivity selectiv-
ities decrease as temperature increases [32]. This leads to a decrease

Pin overall selectivity, as shown in Fig. 2. The reduction in diffusivity
selectivity is because the mobility of molecules with larger kine-
matic diameter increases more dramatically than those with a
smaller diameter. In most cases, however, the smaller gas molecule
is also less condensable. Hence, the influence of temperature on
ideal selectivity is governed by the relative magnitude of size and
solubility of gas molecules. For example, H2/N2 selectivity is mainly
affected by the relatively large size difference between these two
gases (H2 is smaller than N2), rather than their solubility difference
(N2 is more condensable than H2), causing diffusivity selectivity to
decrease significantly with increasing temperature, and thus the
overall selectivity declines (Fig. 2). In the case of H2/CO2 separation,
however, a significant decrease in the solubility of more condensable
gas with temperature causes a substantial increase in solubility
selectivity that consequently offsets the decreasing diffusivity selec-
tivity. This leads to an increase in overall selectivity [32].

PIn general, Tg of a polymer determines whether diffusivity selec-
tivity or solubility selectivity is dominant in the separation process.
Below Tg, the polymer chains are rigid and glassy which causes small
components to preferentially penetrate through glassy membranes.
Above Tg, the mobility of polymer chains increases; thus, the solubil-
ity selectivity becomes dominant [34]. Hence, as mentioned earlier,
the operating temperature has a significant impact on separation
performance of membranes. Enhancing the membrane temperature
brings the sorption and mobility selectivity terms close to each
other; however, its impact on sorption selectivity is more significant.
As a result, enhancing the temperature reduces CO2 sorption which
consequently decreases CO2/H2 selectivity and increases H2/CO2
selectivity (Fig. 2) [34].

PFig. 3 represents a trade-off between CO2/H2 selectivity and CO2
permeability for polymeric membranes with two boundary lines.
The region above the boundary line indicates the operating con-
straint for CO2-selective membranes. The membranes utilized in this
region must be in rubbery state to favor CO2 permeation through the
membrane. The region below this line indicates the operating con-
straint for H2-selective membranes. The membranes used in this
area must be glassy to lean toward H2 permeation. The membrane
performances in H2-selective and CO2-selective separation pro-
cesses, designed by Membrane Technology and Research (MTR), are
also provided in Fig. 3. The performance of MTR membranes is
found to be closer to the upper bounds for both H2/CO2 and CO2/H2
separations. The results presented in Fig. 3 are obtained at ambient
temperature, except for the MTR membranes, where separation per-
formance was determined at 150°C for the H2-selective membranes
and 10°C for the CO2-selective membranes [34]. As a result, with
increasing temperature, the upper bound shifts vertically, and the
magnitude and the direction of this shift depend on the condensabil-
ity and size of the components. Consequently, to maximize H2/CO2
selectivity it is recommended to use glassy H2-selective membranes
at high temperatures, while for CO2/H2 separation, using rubbery
CO2-selective membranes at ambient temperature is suggested
(Fig. 3).

3. Thermally stable polymers

3.1. Essentials of polymer stability

PIn this section, some theoretical requirements of a thermally sta-
ble polymeric material are outlined. The principal source of thermal
stability is the primary bond energy that exists between the atoms
in the polymer chain. The strength of a chemical bond imposes an
upper limit on the vibrational energy that a molecule may possess
without bond rupture [35]. Since heat increases the vibrational
energy, the thermal stability is related to the bond dissociation
energy. The bond dissociation energy between two atoms can be

Pdetermined by measuring the energy of dissociation into separate
atoms or the heat of bond formation from the elements [20].

PPolymers may also derive additional stability from secondary
valence forces. The sum of these forces generally defines what is
called cohesion (i.e., the attraction between neighboring chains).
These forces have a pronounced effect on the melting point (Tm)

Pand the glass transition temperature (Tg). Secondary valence forces
may arise as a result of several effects. The most important ones
are dipole-dipole interaction (up to 8.7 kcal/mole) and hydrogen
bonding (6(cid:1)10 kcal/mole). The latter plays an essential role in
strongly polar polymers such as polyamides and polyurethanes
[20,35].

PHigh thermal stability in polymers can also be achieved by
making full use of resonance stabilization. Resonance stabilization
of aromatic structures, such as benzene or quinoxaline, provides
an additional amount of thermal stability and bond strength. The
resonance energies of these cyclic structures range from 40 to
70 kcal/mole [20,35].

PGenerally, polymers with high melting or softening temperatures
are more heat resistant. Polymers are classified into two groups
depending on their behavior when exposed to heat: thermoplastic
and thermoset polymers. Thermoplastic polymers are softened or
melted when heated and return to a solid state when cooled. The
process is repeatable, and the chemical nature of a thermoplastic
polymer does not change during the melting and solidifying process.
The reason for such behavior stems from weak Van der Waals forces,
strong dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding or even
stacking of aromatic rings in thermoplastic polymers chains [36].
This allows these materials to be reclaimed and recycled. On the
other hand, thermosetting polymers do not soften, and will only
char and break down at high temperatures [26]. This behavior is due
to the crosslinking of molecules by strong chemical bonds [36]. Com-
pared with thermoplastics, thermosets are harder, more rigid and
more brittle. They are also less soluble in organic solvents.

PA cured thermosetting polymer is prepared by irreversible curing
or crosslinking of a polymer or prepolymer by physical or chemical
means. Curing is a chemical process of converting the prepolymer or
polymer in a viscous or soft solid-state to materials with higher
molecular mass. This process can be accomplished by chemical reac-
tions induced by heating (thermal curing), electron-beam irradiation
(EB curing), photo-irradiation (photo-curing), or by mixing with a
chemical curing agent, which is called crosslinking. Crosslinking is a
reaction that occurs between pairs of polymer chains and forms at
least four chains [26,35]. Casting or molding can be carried out dur-
ing curing by heating (usually more than 200°C) or by chemical

Preaction. Usually, thermoset polymer matrices are in a liquid and
malleable state before curing. Therefore, they can be designed to be
molded into their final form, whereas cured thermosets cannot be
remolded to any other shape. Indeed, thermosets with short chains
and highly crosslinked are rigid, whereas the ones with longer
chains and less crosslinked are flexible thermosets. The polymeriza-
tion of thermosets is permanent and irreversible. Typical common
types of thermosetting polymers with a unique set of properties are
epoxies, polyesters, silicones, and phenolics.

PA thermoplastic polymer behaves like a fluid above a certain tem-
perature level and becomes soft and formable when heated, while
heating of a thermoset degrades it without going through a fluid
state. Thermoplastic polymers need no additional chemical process-
ing before molding. The polymer melt can be shaped to its softening
point, and below this point they again become rigid. At any time,
when they are reheated, thermoplastic polymers can be readily
recycled and reshaped. There are three main types of thermoplastic
polymers: amorphous, semi-crystalline and crystalline [37,38]. The
typical spectrum of low- to high-performance amorphous and semi-
crystalline polymers in relation to their cost is shown in Fig. 4. In
this pyramid, common thermoplastic materials were divided into
three categories based on thermal, chemical, and mechanical stabil-
ity. Moreover, the amorphous and semi-crystalline polymers also
can be divided into four categories according to their continuous use
temperature (CUT), as listed in Table 1. Some high-temperature-
resistant thermoplastic polymers are listed in Table 2.

PIndeed, the synthesis of thermally stable polymers is very cost-
intensive. The cost of making a thermally stable polymer is relatively
higher than that of a typical common polymer. Therefore, thermally
stable polymers should demonstrate a significant performance
improvement to justify their high cost. Since there are plenty of syn-
thesis parameters, modeling of the synthesis process to optimize the
parameters is the best way to gain this aim.

Pthe fractional free volume (FFV) of the polymer matrix enhances,
leading more penetrants to diffuse through the membranes. For the
plasticized or swelled membranes, the gas permeation improves
while the membrane selectivity reduces. The condensable pene-
trants swell the space between the polymer chains and suppress the
Tg significantly [41]. The softening point, Ts, is the temperature at
which a polymer softens. Ts, Tg, and Tm, are main parameters that
determine these reversible mechanisms. To prevent softening, two
main factors must be controlled. First, factors that increase Tm
and Tg:

P1. Increasing the polymer's backbone rigidity by introducing para
substituted rings, excluding any flexible linkages and incorpo-
rating bulky side groups to decrease rotational freedom,

P2. Increasing the molecular weight of the polymer, and
P3. Crosslinking the polymer matrix.

PThe second factors are those that increase crystallinity including
structural symmetry and intermolecular attraction forces such as
hydrogen bonds.

PThermal decomposition and degradation occur by thermolysis or
pyrolysis of the polymers. Therefore, the chemical nature of poly-
mers and the bond energies of the polymer backbone determine
this irreversible mechanism. The environmental circumstances
also affect the thermal decomposition. To prevent decomposition
and degradation, the polymer structure must have some features
including aromatic carbocyclic and/or heterocyclic backbones
(instead of aliphatic backbones), resonance structure, rings with
normal bond angles, and strong chemical bonds with high bond
enthalpies. The presence of polybonding to the main chain of the
polymer also helps polymers to resist decomposition. In contrast,
the presence of weak spots such as non-aromatic hydrogen bonds,
aliphatic groups, and pendant hydroxyl groups decreases the ther-
mal stability of polymers [40].

PTwo basic mechanisms control polymer deterioration at elevated
temperature. The first mechanism involves a reversible, wholly tem-
perature-dependent softening phenomenon for thermoplastics; and
an irreversible, time-, temperature-, and environment-dependent
degradative process for thermosets [39]. The second mechanism
involves factors that increase crystallinity, including structural sym-
metry, intermolecular attraction forces such as hydrogen bonds, and
the absence of random side groups [40].

PIn the first mechanism, softening leads polymers to lose their
mechanical stability. Swelling and plasticization of polymers,
induced by condensable components such as CO2 and heavy hydro-
carbons, is classified as a subset of softening. These two phenomena
take place by the dissolution of gas components in the polymer
matrix that causes deformation of the membrane structure. Hence

3.2. Types of thermally stable polymers as potential for gas separation
membrane materials

PThermally stable polymers can be classified into several distinct
categories, each meeting one or more of the heat-resistant features
of the polymer. These categories are as follows:

P1- Fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
which are characterized by high C-F bond energy and shielding
of the carbon chain.

P2- Inorganic polymers such as siloxanes and polyphosphazenes,

which have high bond energies.

P3- Carbocyclic polymers such as PAs and polysulfones (PSFs), which
are characterized by resonance stability, stiff chains, and high Tg.
P4- Heterocyclic polymers such as polyimides (PIs) and polybenzi-
midazoles (PBIs), which have the same characteristics as carbo-
cyclic polymers.

P5- Ladder polymers such as polypyrrone, which have polybondings,

stiff chains, and high Tg.

PIt is worth mentioning that the copolymers of the above-men-
tioned polymers can also be considered thermally stable. In fact,
copolymers, primarily graft copolymers, are widely reported in the
literature as high thermal and mechanical strength materials. A
graft copolymer is a segmented polymer with a main linear back-
bone of one polymer and randomly distributed branches of another
polymer. The grafted chains of a copolymer, which are structurally
different from the main chain, are covalently bonded to the poly-
mer, thereby enhancing the mechanical and thermal properties of
the main polymer [42].

3.3. Processability

PResearch concerning thermally stable polymers has always
emphasized the improvement of their processability (workability) in
fabrication processes. For instance, in the preparation of polymeric
membranes, the possibility to dissolve the polymer in common sol-
vents and then form it into different shapes (flat sheet, tubular and
spiral), is the key and also usually the first challenge.

PThe processability of a thermally stable polymer is primariyl lim-
ited by its insolubility and infusibility. In fact, the search for better
solvents is the first strategy to solve this problem. In many cases,
even aprotic polar solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc are not
useful. It was discovered that the addition of inorganic salts such as
CaCl2 or LiCl improves these solvents’ power for certain polymers.
Despite this approach being widely adopted, most thermally stable
polymers seem to be still insoluble. Ultimately, strong acids, such as
concentrated sulfuric acid, can be used as a solvent for most ther-
mally stable polymers. However, the use of such corrosive solvents
presents additional problems [43]. A soluble polyaromatic is often
amorphous and has a relatively low Tg. The thermally stable polyaro-
matics (amorphous or crystalline) with low Tg or Tm can be proc-
essed by melt techniques [44].

PThere are different ways to improve the processability of ther-
mally stable polymers. Generally, the inclusion of flexible groups
into an all-aromatic polymer chain enhances the processability but
reduces the processing temperature as a consequence of lower
phase transition temperatures [45]. For example, the introduction
of flexible groups such as ether or sulfonyl groups in the polymer
backbone can increase the flexibility and thus increase solubility.
Most carbocyclic aromatic polymers, such as the PA, polyesters, and
PSFs already possess flexible units and are therefore much more
tractable compared to heterocyclic polymers [40]. However, both
the thermal and chemical stabilities of the carbocyclic polymers are
inferior to those of the heterocyclic polymers. Another example is
the introduction of bulky side groups to the backbone, which was

Papplied by Cassidy [19] and Hergenrother [46] for polyphenylenes
and polyquinoxalines, respectively. The more tractable form of the
phenylated polymers was attributed to a decrease in crystallinity.
Fig. 5 shows a comparison of processing temperatures of some
polymers.

POne way to solve the processability problem is to chemically
modify a processable polymer after or during preparation, to pro-
duce a polymer with improved properties. Any modification by
chemical reaction intended for this purpose should fulfill the follow-
ing requirements:

P(1) the reaction should be carried out without any volatile by-
products to prevent void formation and reduce the strength of
the prepared components,

P(2) the reaction temperature should be above the Tg and below the

polymer decomposition temperature,

P(3) the thermal stability of the modified polymers should be higher

than that of the unmodified polymers,

P(4) the rate of the reaction must be consistent with the polymer

processing period [45].

PFor instance, crosslinking of the polymer after or during its prep-
aration can improve the properties of processable thermally stable
polymers. Highly crosslinked polymers exhibit excellent properties
such as good dimension stability with low creep rates, high resis-
tance to solvents, enhanced softening temperatures, and improved
the analogous uncrosslinked polymers
thermal stability over
[20,45]. The crosslinking sites in a polymer exist in a number of loca-
tions including (1) the polymer backbone, (2) the pendant group, (3)
the utilized additive, and (4) the end cap for low molecular weight
oligomers. The last one has attracted the most attention, because it
is particularly useful for the melt processing of thermally stable pol-
ymers, owing to the improved melt flow characteristics of oligomers
compared to high molecular weight polymers [45]. Different kinds
of crosslinking sites have been employed to improve the properties
of thermally stable polymers. Some crosslinked polymers exhibit
impressive performance at high temperatures, but their mechanical
properties can only be maintained for a short period.

PAnother important way to solve the intractability without chang-
ing the chemical structure is preparing the polymer in two or more
steps through a processable prepolymer. The prepolymer converts
into the desired polymer by a thermal or chemical treatment. Many
of the heterocyclic polymers, e.g., polybenzoxazoles and PIs, can be
prepared by this technique [48]. Another technique is the prepara-
tion of oligomers of the desired polymers with reactive end groups,
like acetylene, norbornene or biphenylene. These end-capped
oligomers are processable due to their low molecular weights. Upon

Pthermal treatment, crosslinking reactions are set in without any vol-
atile by-products, resulting in chain extension or crosslinking into a
network structure [40]. Hergenrother conducted a comprehensive
research on many polymers such as PIs, polyquinoxalines, and PSF
using this technique [49,50].

PThe techniques mentioned above can be integrated to increase
the processability of the polymers. Researchers who tend to utilize
high-temperature resistant polymers to prepare membranes must
be aware if these techniques have been applied to increase the poly-
mer processability. Although this is not simple, there are some
guidelines which can be helpful. For example, studying the polymer
specification sheets provided by the supplier; finding the potential
applications of the polymer; asking the supplier about the polymer
processability, its solvents and its chemical structure; and finally
conducting some analysis such as FTIR and NMR to guess chemical
bonds and functional groups of polymer can help the researcher at
the first stage of the research, i.e., selecting the material.

PThe thermal behavior of a polymeric membrane can be either
investigated by general thermal analysis (TA) techniques or more
practically by GS tests using high temperature/pressure permea-
meter. These two techniques are described in this section.

P3.3.1. Thermal analysis (TA) techniques

PTA includes a family of measuring techniques that share a com-
mon feature: They measure a material's response to being heated,
cooled or held isothermally. The goal is to establish a connection
between temperature and specific physical properties of materials
[51]. The most popular TA techniques are presented in Table 3. All
these techniques measure a physical property as a function of tem-
perature or time. To gain a better understanding of the behavior of
thermally stable polymers, at least several thermal analyses must be
employed at the same time.

PTA is typically used for measuring the actual physical properties
of materials, elucidating their thermal and mechanical histories,
characterizing and designing processes used in their manufacture,
and finally for estimating the lifetime of materials in various envi-
ronments. Thus, TA can be used in laboratories as a research and
quality control method for the development of new polymeric mate-
rials, as well as, in industries where these materials are incorporated
into final products [51].

PIn DSC, the difference in the amount of heat required for increas-
ing the temperature of a sample and a reference material is mea-
sured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference
are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the
experiment [52]. The polymer films are heated with constant heat-
ing rate and factors corresponding to the polymer stability against
softening, like Tg and Tm, are measured. TMA and TD are also applica-
ble for softening investigations. In these techniques, the change in
sample length or volume in compression or tension under constant
or variable force as a function of temperature or time is measured.
The most important TMA measurements include determination of
the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE, a) and Tg [51].

PIn DTA, similar to DSC, the material under study and a reference
material undergo identical thermal cycles, and any temperature dif-
ference between sample and reference is recorded [53]. This differ-
ential temperature is then plotted against temperature. Any change
in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, is detected relative
to a reference. Accordingly, a DTA curve provides valuable data on
the transformations that have occurred, such as Tg, crystallization,
melting, and sublimation.

PTG or TGA are types of testing performed on a sample to evaluate
its resistance to decomposition and degradation. In a particular tem-
perature range, no observed weight loss indicates high thermal sta-
bility of a material. Negligible mass loss relates to slight or no slope
in the TGA trace. After collecting the data, their post-processing is
done to find the exact points of inflection [51]. TGA gives the upper
practice temperature of a polymer, beyond that, the polymer begins
to degrade. Meanwhile, in some cases, thermal stability is defined as
a temperature at which a particular fraction of weight loss takes
place.

PIGA is a type of TG that measures weight change with time at a
specific temperature, providing information on material thermal sta-
bility and compositional analysis. Since the isothermal condition is a
case that more closely simulates the actual fabrication process of
thermoplastic materials, the isothermal TG data are of more practical
importance than the dynamic ones [53].

PDMA method is typically utilized to study the viscoelastic behav-
ior of polymers. A small cyclic strain is imposed on a sample, and the
resulting stress response is measured, or equivalently, a cyclic stress
is applied, and the strain in the material is measured. This process
enables determining complex modulus. The temperature of the sam-
ple or the frequency of the stress is often varied to create variations
in the complex modulus. This approach can be used to locate the Tg
of the material as well as to identify transitions corresponding to
other molecular motions. Thermally induced DMA is called DMTA
[54].

PDEA is the same as DMA except that an oscillating electrical field
is used instead of a mechanical force. It can be used for investigation
of the curing behavior of thermosetting resin systems, composite
materials, adhesives, and paints. Thermally induced DEA is DETA
[51].

Pm/n(cid:1)TA (micro-scale or nano-scale thermal analysis) includes
techniques or combinations of techniques that use a method of
highly local material property characterization, e.g., atomic or scan-
ning force microscopy (AFM or SFM), carried out at the micrometer
or nanometer scale, on a sample subjected to a controlled tempera-
ture regime. Therefore, m/n(cid:1)TA is a combination of AFM or SFM
with one or more of the TA techniques including TMA, DMA, and
DTA [51]. Detailed descriptions of the techniques mentioned above
can be found in the literature [51(cid:1)54].

P3.3.2. High temperature/pressure permeameter design

PEvaluating the membrane performance at elevated temperature
and pressure requires a specially designed system. Gas permea-
meters are usually employed to estimate permeation across

low temperatures (< 50°C) and low pressures
Pmembranes at
(< 0.5 MPa). In such circumstances high-pressure and high-tempera-
ture seals are not required, thereby simplifying the membrane cell
design. In order to use a gas permeameter, an experimental protocol
is needed for measuring the external leak rate, which d is estimated
from the total pressure on the downstream side. At low tempera-
tures and pressures, internal leak of the membrane cell is negligible
owing to the use of highly effective seals. However, this internal leak
is significant at high temperatures and pressures and must be con-
sidered to measure gas permeation more accurately [55]. Perez et al.
[55] designed and constructed a high-pressure, high-temperature
(HPHT) permeameter (Fig. 6) for the testing of flat polymer mem-
branes at temperatures up to 300°C and pressures up to 3.0 MPa.
The permeameter was used to measure the gas flux (N2, H2, and CO2)
through polymer membranes at constant downstream volume. The
instrument involves metering valves (MV) to control pressurization
of the membrane by adjusting the gas flow rate at the upstream
compartment. The check valves (CV) were used to discharge extra
pressure from the downstream and upstream compartments as well
as the feed side. This helps keeping the transducers and other equip-
ment safe from over-pressurization. For testing flammable gases, the

Pmembrane module is housed in a high-temperature oven and an
inert gas is purged permanently to avoid the buildup of leaked gases.
The system is also equipped with a line for the analysis of residual
gas [55].

4. Why high temperature resistant polymeric membranes are
promising?

PThe majority of polymer membranes used in membrane-based
GS processes show poor thermal resistance. In many applications, it
is necessary to work at higher temperatures [56,57]. On the other
hand, membranes with high stabilities could open up new fields of
applications by prolonging the lifetime of membranes at elevated
temperatures. As a matter of fact, from the viewpoint of cost and
energy saving, it is often crucial for the membranes to be operated at
the highest allowable temperatures. Currently, most of the GS
systems require an efficient heat exchanger to bring down the mem-
brane influent temperature typically below 50°C. Such a require-
ment means demands on extra capital and operating cost when
dealing with a hot stream [58]. Moreover, high costs associated with
the novel raw materials and the low processability of thermally

Pstable polymers have limited their commercialization to the rela-
tively specialized field of GS.

PA principal mission of researchers is to foster the advancement
of commercially-ready approaches for GS. In many industrial GS
processes, the operating temperatures are much higher than 200 °C
[59]. In this section, two well-known chemical engineering pro-
cesses that are operated at high temperatures, as well as, the cur-
rent and potential application of heat-resistant membranes in
these processes are presented. These processes are CO2/syngas and
NH3/CO2 separation in coal gasification and Haber Bosch processes,
respectively.

PCoal gasification for the conversion of solid coal to syngas
(H2 þ CO) with simultaneous CO2 separation could enhance energy
security in an environmentally accountable way. To meet the pur-
pose of producing clean energy by coal gasification, energy- and
cost-efficient membrane separation technique for the treatment of
syngas is required. In the pre-combustion-based capture of CO2, the
process conditions (temperature and pressure) and CO2 composition
vary throughout the advanced Integrated Gasification Combined-
Cycle (IGCC) plant (Fig. 7). Hence, the purge gas of syngas process
should be regulated in composition and recycled into the catalyzer
at high temperatures (100-150°C). The temperature of this purge gas
is about 150°C, and by using a high-temperature-resistant mem-
brane, extensive cooling before the membrane separation and
reheating prior to recycling into the catalyzer will be eliminated
(Fig. 8) [60]. For this purpose, thermally stable membranes, with the
H2 permeation of > 200 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of > 10, can be
used at the downstream or upstream of the Water-Gas Shift (WGS
reactors).

PThe in-situ H2/CO2 separation in WGS reactions needs mem-
branes which can withstand 300-600°C and upstream pressure of up
to 2.7 MPa [55]. High CO tolerance at higher temperatures makes it
possible to use hydrogen directly from a simple reformer so that the

PWGS reactor, the selective oxidizer, and/or a separation process
for the CO removal can be eliminated from the fuel gas processing
system. Moreover, The CO poisoning effect will be considerably
diminished. This effect has been shown to be very temperature-
dependent,
i.e., CO adsorption becomes less pronounced with
increasing temperature.

PNH3/CO2 separation in Haber Bosch process is another example
that can be modified using thermally stable membranes. In ammonia
synthesis loop based on Haber Bosch process, ammonia is commonly
separated by liquefaction, where a mixture of ammonia with CO2,
H2, and N2 at elevated temperature is cooled down below 10°C. Tak-
ing into account the huge amount of gas mixture that should be
cooled, the application of NH3/CO2 selective thermally stable mem-
branes can potentially result in a remarkable reduction in opera-
tional cost [63,64].

5. Heat-resistant polymeric membranes

PAs described earlier, two main categories of plastic polymers are
identified based on their thermal behavior: (i) thermoplastics, hav-
ing linear molecular chains which are normally produced in one step
before being fabricated into the final product by a subsequent pro-
cess; and (ii) thermosets, which are made of crosslinked molecular
chains and require a two-stage polymerization process. Both of these
polymers can be applied for making heat-resistant membranes.
According to the literature, for both thermoplastics and thermosets,
control of polymer synthesis conditions enables the increase of ther-
mal stability [65(cid:1)71]. The combination of linkage groups like ether
with sulfone and/or ketone in thermoplastic polymers [66] and the
degree of crosslinking in thermosetting polymers [72] were found
to affect the thermal stability. Thermal stability was also proven
to increase by using chain-stiffening structures like carbocyclic
and heterocyclic groups. Although in most cases, there is a clear

Pboundary between thermoset and thermoplastic polymers, there are
some polymers for which classification into either one of these cate-
gories is impossible by just knowing the polymer's name. For exam-
ple, PIs and polyurethanes can be either thermoset or thermoplastic,
according to the type of interactions between their main chains. PIs
synthesized from different monomers were reported to demonstrate
dissimilar thermal behaviors [73(cid:1)76]. Thermal curing can also
change the thermoplasticity of polymers. PBI is considered as one of
the highest performing engineering thermoplastics [77]. This poly-
mer varies from a thermoplastic material to a thermoset resin at
around 450°C, and after heat treatment at 500°C, it becomes entirely
insoluble in all solvents [78]. Moreover, crosslinking of thermoplas-
tic polymers may lead to infusible, insoluble thermosets depending
on the degree of crosslinking [79].Thermoplastic polymers are usu-
ally crosslinked to yield optimum thermal and mechanical proper-
ties [80(cid:1)92]. However, it must be noted that crosslinking does not
always enhance the thermal stability of the polymers [81,82,84,85].
Since differentiation between thermoset and thermoplastic poly-
mers is sometimes impossible (especially, when polymers are post-
treated during membrane preparation procedure), classification of
heat resistant polymeric membranes into these two categories may
become confusing. As discussed earlier, the thermal stability of poly-
mers can be improved by increasing the interactions between poly-
mers chains [72]. Higher interactions can be achieved by:

P(i) Fluorinated polymers: using halogens (mainly fluorine) instead
of hydrogen in the polymer matrix, e.g., polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),

P(ii) Inorganic polymers: using inorganic elements (mainly silicon
and phosphorous) in the polymer backbone, e.g., polydimethyl-
siloxane (PDMS) and polyphosphazenes,

(iii) Carbocyclic polymers: using carbocyclic groups (primarily ben-
zene) in the polymer backbone with or without linkage groups
like ether and sulfone, e.g., PA, PSF, and PES,

(iv) Heterocyclic polymers: using heterocyclic groups (mainly succi-

nimide and benzimidazole, e.g., PIs and PBI,

P(v) Ladder polymers: formation of double-stranded polymers by
cyclization of single-stranded carbocyclic or heterocyclic prepol-
ymers or novel polycondensation methods [93,94], e.g., polypyr-
rone.

PIn addition to the above-mentioned approaches that directly
improve the thermal stability of polymers, there are two other meth-
ods which can enhance chain stiffness by incorporating polymeric or
inorganic additives into the target polymer. These methods are as
follows:

(vi) Polymer blends: mixing at least two polymers to create a new
material with enhanced physical properties, e.g., mixture of pol-
ymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and PVDF,

(vii)Hybrid inorganic/polymer membranes: introducing inorganic
material into the polymer to make a hybrid material with
advantages of both polymer and inorganic, e.g., PES/TiO2 nano-
composites.

PIn this section, earlier efforts to make heat-resistant polymeric
membranes are reviewed and classified. The aim is to (i) find high-
performance polymers utilized for the fabrication of membranes, (ii)
investigate their processability (preparation methods), (iii) review
available thermal analysis techniques, (iv) examine the application
of the synthesized membranes, and (v) explore significant modifica-
tions that can be used to improve the thermal stability of the mem-
branes. It is worth noting that some of these polymers can be
classified into more than one category. For example, all cyclic fluori-
nated polymers and polyphosphazenes (as an inorganic polymer)
can also be considered as carbocyclic, heterocyclic, and even ladder
polymers. However, they are classified according to the method

Pwhich is employed to enhance their thermal stability further. For
instance, fluorination of some cyclic polymers like PEK and PI, which
are as such considered as heat resistant polymers due to the
chain stiffness induced by cyclic groups, can make them more heat-
resistant. Therefore, they are classified as fluorinated polymeric
membranes.

5.1. Fluorinated polymeric membranes

PHigh-performance fluorinated polymers have attracted a lot of
attention as they significantly improve several properties of the poly-
mers including lower dielectric constant and moisture uptake
(hydrophobic), enhanced solubility in organic solvents, higher ther-
mal and thermoxidative stability, lower surface energy, better optical
transparency, along with higher gas permeability and flame resis-
tance as compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts [95,96].
Substituting trifluoromethyl ((cid:1)CF3) groups into the backbone of pol-
ymers, such as PEKs, polyarylene ethers (PAEs) and PIs, is one of the
most extensively employed strategies for polymer modification,
allowing substantial property improvement. The low polarizability
and strong C(cid:1)F bond increase the thermal and chemical stability of
the fluorinated polymers. Several attempts have been made to syn-
thesize these bulky (cid:1)CF3 substituted monomers. Considerable stud-
ies have been done to explore their polymerization and to evaluate
their structural properties. The CF3 group increases the FFV of the
polymers and disturbs the chain packing, which results in improved
permeation and electrical insulating properties as well.

PPolymers containing (cid:1)CF3 groups attracted significant attention
for membrane GS due to their improved solubility and permeability
properties. The GS properties of some PAE-based polymers with
substituted (cid:1)CF3 groups are presented here. Xu et al. [97] synthe-
sized membranes from PAEs containing diphenylfluorene (FBP)
along with 2,6-bis(trifluoromethylphenylene) pyridine (FBP-6FPPr)
or 2,5-bis(3-trifluoromethylphenylene) thiophene (FBP-6FPT). Non-
porous membranes were prepared by casting the PAE solution onto
glass plates and drying for 24 h at 100 °C under vacuum. The perme-
ability, diffusivity, and selectivity of He, H2, CO2, O2, N2, and CH4
gases were investigated over the temperature range of 30-65°C.
Increasing temperature was found to increase the permeation flux of
all gases but decreased the CO2/CH4 permselectivity. The change in
gas permeation properties with temperature showed no significant
thermal transitions of the polymers and Arrhenius expressions were
used to find activation energies of gases for the permeation and dif-
fusion through the membranes. The synthesized FBP-6FPPr and FBP-
6FPT membranes exhibited higher gas permeabilities than other
FBP-containing membranes reported in the literature. Xu et al. [97]
obtained better permeability and selectivity results by just replacing
the thiophene group in FBP-6FPT with the pyridine group in FBP-
6FPPr. Separation property of polymeric membranes containing Flu-
orene moieties is presented in Table 4. In this table, the impact of
various flexible segments on the permeability and selectivity of FPB-
based polymers is provided. Similar to indane-containing PEKs, the
FPB moieties in these polymers are bulky, large, and rigid. As a result,
factors including the length of the “flexible segment” and its archi-
tecture (structure and bond angle), as well as, the degree of free rota-
tion around the bonds have significant effects on membrane
permeation and selectivity. It was found that as the flexible seg-
ments length among the FPB groups increased the CO2 permeation
decreased, except for FBP/tBIA, FBP/6FPT, and FBP/6FPPr which
exhibited higher permeability than other FBP-containing mem-
branes. Although these membranes have different structures, it can
be concluded that substituting C(CH3)3 and/or -CF3 groups on the
benzene ring in the flexible segment can significantly enhance mem-
brane permeation. For instance, the permeability of O2 and CO2 in
FBP/6FPPr membrane is 3 and 1.5 times higher than that of FBPS.
Fig. 9 shows a linear trade-off between CO2/CH4 selectivity and

PCO2 permeability for all FBP-containing polymeric membranes.
According to this figure, the thermally stable membranes with the
pyridinylidene group provide GS performance superior to those con-
taining the thiophenylidene group [97].

PXu et al. [98] also performed a similar study on PAEs containing
6FPPr and 6FPT units along with isopropylidene ((cid:1)C(CH3)2) or hexa-
fluoroisopropylidene ((cid:1)C(CF3)2) moieties in the bisphenol segment
and tested the prepared membranes at different temperatures
between 30 and 75°C. Linear Arrhenius curves were obtained for the
temperature dependence of gas permeation and diffusion that
enabled measurement of gas transport activation energies. Replace-
ment of (cid:1)C(CH3)2 with (cid:1)C(CF3)2 enhanced the CO2/CH4 selectivity.
Membranes prepared from 6FPPy showed slightly higher permeabil-
ity coefficients (»3 Barrer more) than those made from 6FPT. This
result was attributed to the more bulkiness of pyridinylidene moiety
in the 6FPPy polymers compared to the thiophene moiety in 6FPT
polymers [98]. The PAEs with a terphenyl unit in the main chain and
pendent trifluoromethyl groups showed high gas permeability (e.g.,
5(cid:1)57 Barrer for CO2 at 35°C and 10 atm) and very low selectivities
(15(cid:1)27 for CO2/CH4 at 35°C and 10 atm) [99].

the typical

PDasgupta et al. [100] investigated the effect of heterocyclic moie-
ties in the backbone and pendent trifluoromethyl groups on perme-
ation and diffusion of CO2, CH4, N2, and O2 through five fluorinated
poly(ether imide) (PEI) membranes at 35, 45, and 55°C. High decom-
position temperature and Tg of the synthesized polymers (513 § 10
and 253 § 12°C, respectively) indicated their high thermal stability.
All synthesized membranes showed excellent permeability (35(cid:1)45
Barrer for CO2 at 35°C and 3.5 bar) which was related to the presence
of bulky indane group in the polymer backbone and pendent CF3
groups. Among these PEI membranes, BPI-6FDA containing (cid:1)C(CF3)2
group exhibited the highest CO2 permeability of 57.45 Barrer, as well
as, relatively high selectivity of 35.46 for CO2/CH4. The gas permeabil-
ity and selectivity show that
trade-off relationship
between these two parameters is overcome. Dasgupta et al. [100]
attributed this result to the restricted local segmental mobility due to
the limited torsional motion of phenyl rings around trifluoromethyl
groups. The high chain stiffness, confirmed by high Tg of this polymer,
is expected to decrease the gas permeability. However, increased local
segmental mobility due to the presence of more flexible ether link-
ages in this polymer enhanced the FFV and thus the gas permeability.
PSimilar studies were performed by Sen et al. [101] on the indane-
based PEIs and reported high permeability (22(cid:1)52 Barrer for CO2
at 35°C and 3.5 bar), as well as, moderate selectivity (24(cid:1)32 for
CO2/CH4 at 35°C and 3.5 bar). PIs synthesized by the 6FDA monomer
exhibited the highest CO2 permeability and ideal selectivity towards
CO2/CH4. This result was mainly attributed to the number of (cid:1)CF3
groups in the polymer chains which increased the FFV. Sen and
Banerjee [102] also synthesized different bis(ether amine)s by react-
ing p-aminophenol with different bis-fluoro compounds. They
changed the bond angle, intersegmental length, and polarity of the
PEIs and investigated the effects of these parameters on gas perme-
ability, selectivity, and activation energy of gases. They also con-
ducted extensive research on the gas permeation properties of
fluorinated PEI membranes containing the cardo phthalimidine moi-
ety in the main chain. Different types of dianhydrides including
6FDA, ODPA, BPADA, BTDA, and PMDA were employed to synthesize
membranes. All these membranes showed dramatically higher per-
meability (15(cid:1)55 Barrer for CO2 at 35°C and 3.5 bar), as well as,
moderate selectivity (17(cid:1)53 for CO2/CH4 at 35°C and 3.5 bar) than
common PSF, CA, and PC membranes, as well as, their analogues pol-
ymers containing cardo phenolphthalein, phthalimide, or phthalimi-
dine moieties [102].

PPolymers containing loop-shaped moieties are called “cardo pol-
ymers”, where “cardo” means “loop or hinge” [103]. In bis(phenyl)
fluorene-based cardo polymers, a Fluorene unit protrudes perpen-
dicularly to the main chain and four phenyl rings are connected to a

Pquadruple carbon (Fig. 10) which intensifies the rotational hindrance
of the phenyl groups. The bis(phenyl) fluorene and bis(phenyl)iso-
propane polymers have the same basic chemical structures (Fig. 11),
the minor difference being their fluorene and isopropane moieties.
The stiff cardo moiety reduces intersegmental packing and decreases
the main chain's rotational mobility. The membranes formed from
phenylfluorene-based cardo display excellent properties such as
high thermal stability, solubility, refraction index and so on. The
high solubility facilitates the preparation of asymmetric or compos-
ite membranes. Accordingly, the cardo polymers can be good candi-
dates for producing thermally stable membranes having improved
performance, especially for gas transport properties [103(cid:1)105].

PKazama et al. [103] examined the CO2 and N2 transport proper-
ties of bis(phenyl)fluorene-based cardo membranes. The relation-
ship between the gas transport properties and polymer rigidity was
studied using various cardo PIs synthesized from a variety of dianhy-
drides. The polymers used in this study were PA, PC, PI, and PSF. The
permeabilities of cardo membranes were higher than those of com-
mercial polymeric membranes because of their larger gas solubility.
Though attempts were made to introduce the bulky moiety to the
cardo polymers, the gas diffusivity of the modified membranes was
equal to that of the commercial polymeric membranes. Their obser-
vations indicated that the bulky moiety increases the Tg and D-spac-
ing of polymers. These researchers correlated the gas permeability,
solubility, and diffusivity of the cardo PIs with their FFV, and found
that the rigid PIs have a large FFV, and therefore high gas permeabil-
ity, solubility, and diffusivity. The cardo-based polymers have larger
D-spacings than bis(phenyl)isopropane-based polymers, showing
that the cardo moiety can enhance the average distance of the main
chains. Meanwhile, PIs have larger D-spacings than those of the other
cardo polymers. As a result, among the four bridge structures (car-
bonate, sulfone, amide, and imide), the imide ring can create larger
open chain structures. The bulky cardo moiety, as compared to the
bis(phenyl)isopropane moiety, does not enhance the FFV of poly-
mers except for the cardo polyimide. On the other hand, the FFV of
the cardo PIs is higher than those of the bis(phenyl)isopropane-
based polymer.

PKazama and Sakashita [106] prepared integrally skinned asym-
metric hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) from a bis(phenyl)fluorene-
based cardo PA by a wet phase inversion technique. The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cross-section and the sche-
matic diagram of the inner skin layer of cardo PA HFM are shown in
Fig. 12. The schematic view of the internal structure indicates the
presence of rounded cylindrical nodules in the synthesized mem-
brane. The “topmost layer” was defect-free with about 11 § 2 nm
thickness where the nodules are compactly combined and aligned in
the direction of the spinning flow. The microvoids were present in
the middle layer, namely “underlying transition region”, with nearly

“topmost layer” had almost the same size. The bottom layer was a
microporous support with larger nodules than the other two layers.
The HFM synthesized by this method was found to be stable at tem-
peratures up to 240°C.

PAl-Masri et al. [107] prepared methyl-substituted diaminoter-
phenylenes by palladium-catalyzed coupling of bisboronic acids and
bromoaromatics and polymerized them with fluorinated dianhy-
dride 6FDA to synthesize PIs containing (cid:1)CF3 groups at high yields.

PThe synthesized polymers were reported to be easily soluble in com-
mon high boiling point aprotic solvents like NMP, DMF, and dime-
thylsulfoxide (DMSO), as well as, in low boiling point solvents like
tetrahydrofuran (THF), CH2Cl2, and CHCl3. The membranes were fab-
ricated by solution casting. The Tg of the prepared membranes was
measured by DSC and DMTA. Steric hindrance of methyl groups was
shown to result in rigid structures with Tg higher than 300°C. With
increasing the number of methyl substituents ortho to the imide
nitrogen, gas permeability, diffusivity, and solubility were increased.

175(cid:1)212 °C and was found to decrease by increasing the mole frac-
tion of BHPHFP monomer in the final structure. Introducing sulfonic
acid pendant groups to the backbone of the polymer enhanced the
processability of the polymer by increasing its solubility in common
solvents; however, sacrificed the thermal stability due to splitting-
off the sulfonic acid at lower temperatures. TGA(cid:1)FTIR coupling was
used to identify the splitting-off temperature of the sulfonic acid
group. This temperature was found to be in the range of 240(cid:1)260 °C,
which was more than the Tg of the polymers. Accordingly, the uti-
lized sulfonation rate was found to be suitable for making PAES poly-
mers and did not deteriorate their thermal stability.

PIn summary, the fluorinated polymers have high processability
and thermal stability, which makes them suitable candidates for
high-temperature GS applications. The high solubility of these poly-
mers in various solvents (from low to a high boiling point) has

Presulted in the production of porous (by phase inversion) and dense
(by solution evaporation) membranes suitable for GS. Outstanding
ionic (conductive) properties of fluorinated polymers, as a result of
incorporating trifluoromethyl groups onto the polymer backbone, as
well as, high thermal and mechanical stability due to C-F bonds have
directed the application of these polymers primarily toward fuel
cells. The literature survey showed the promising potential of these
membranes for high-temperature gas treatment and this is the topic
of ongoing research.

5.2. Inorganic polymeric membranes

POrganic-metallic and inorganic polymers like ferrocene, poly-
carboranes, siloxanes, and polyphosphazenes are other types of
thermally stable polymers. The addition of an inorganic element
in the building block of the polymer is assumed to decrease the
polymer chain mobility and subsequently increase the thermal
stability [109]. Among the above-mentioned inorganic polymers,
siloxanes and polyphosphazenes have already been used for mem-
brane fabrication.

PSilicone-based membranes are well-established for their high-
temperature resistance (up to 200°C). If a silicone polymer could be
coated on an inorganic support, the resulting composite membrane
is anticipated to be thermally tolerant. Inspired by this idea, Li et al.
[110] developed a high temperature resistant heterogeneous com-
posite PDMS membrane using an in-situ monomer gas-phase poly-
merization technique. In their method, a porous Vycor glass tube
was used as a support after pretreatment. Monomer (dichlorodime-
thylsilane and dichloromethyl vinyl silane) and catalyst (an aque-
ous solution of ammonia, NH3 or hydrated ammonium carbonate
(NH4)2CO3H2O) were introduced inside and outside of the porous
Vycor glass tube, respectively (Fig. 14). The polymerization took
place in the pores of the Vycor glass tube at room temperature
[110,111].

PGenerally, polysiloxanes (or silicone rubber) are synthesized
from chlorosilanes [112]. Chlorosilane is hydrolyzed to the corre-
sponding silanol, which then undergoes polymerization by dehydra-
tion to yield polysiloxane. The intermediate silanols are not isolated
under the reaction conditions, but rapidly undergo polycondensa-
tion reaction upon hydrolysis of the chlorosilane (Fig. 15).

PLi et al. [110,111] successfully coated a polymeric film on a
porous Vycor glass tube and tested the prepared composite mem-
brane by measuring the permeability of He, H2, N2, CO, O2, Ar, CO2
and C2H4 at pressures up to 233 cmHg in the temperature range of

P20(cid:1)200 °C. The permeability of low-soluble gases, such as He, H2,
N2, CO, O2, and Ar, increased with increasing temperature, while
those for highly soluble gases, such as CO2 and C2H4, decreased.
There was a transition point between 140 °C and 160 °C. Above this
point, the permeability of most gases (except He and H2) decreased
with increasing the temperature. This result is consistent with previ-
ously reported gas and vapor permeability variation with tempera-
ture in a rubbery polymeric membrane such as PDMS [113(cid:1)122].

PLi and Hwang [123] investigated the thermal stability of highly
crosslinked polymethylsiloxane (PMS) by TGA under both isother-
mal and elevated temperature conditions with several environmen-
tal gases, such as O2, N2, air and He. Based on TGA experiments, they
suggested a temperature increasing rate of less than 10 °C/min for
the preparation of a silicon-based inorganic membrane using a
pyrolysis process [59,112,123]. They measured permeation rates for
various gases (He, H2, N2, CO, O2, Ar, CO2, H2S, and C3H6) in the tem-
perature range of 20 °C and 700 °C, and showed that the permeabil-
ity of all gases decreased with increasing temperature. The
permeability of condensable gases such as CO2, C3H6, and H2S
decreased faster than that of non-condensable gases such as N2, He,
Ar and O2. This phenomenon was attributed to the different mecha-
nism of gas flow through a microporous inorganic membrane than
that in polymeric membranes. The permeability of polymeric mem-
branes is described by the solution-diffusion mechanism, whereas in
inorganic microporous membranes the mechanism consists of the
Knudsen flow, which occurs in the gas phase, and the adsorbate flow
(activated diffusion), which occurs on the surface of the membrane
pores. Therefore, increasing the temperature decreases the surface
concentration of the adsorbates in inorganic membranes and thus
reduces the permeability [59]. Li and Hwang [123] illustrated that
the pyrolysis of a thermoset polymer leads to the formation of inor-
ganic polymers which can resist elevated temperatures up to 700 °C.
Despite high performance of these polymers, it must be mentioned
that the investigation of inorganic carbon membranes is not in the
scope of this study.

PPolyphosphazenes include a broad range of polymers that con-
tain alternating phosphorus and nitrogen atoms with double bonds
as a backbone [124]. The three main classes of polyphosphazenes
are linear, cyclolinear, and cyclomatrix, as shown in Fig. 16
[125,126]. With appropriate functionalization of these polymers
(substituting different side groups, R), a number of specialty poly-
mers can be synthesized with properties tailored for a specific appli-
cation like membrane fabrication [127(cid:1)129].

Pphysical properties. For example, poly[bis-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)
ethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP) possesses flexible polyether chains
that impart both a low Tg and low water solubility. In contrast, poly
[bis(phenoxy)phosphazene] (PPOP) can also be synthesized, yielding
a semi-crystalline polymer with a Tg »8°C. Glassy polymers, such as
poly[bis(anilino)phosphazene], with a Tg of »91°C can also be formed
[131,132]. Given such a broad thermal properties, polyphosphazene
membranes can be synthesized by various techniques like phase
inversion and solution casting (solvent evaporation) for GS applica-
tions [124,127,130,133(cid:1)137]. However, few of these membranes
have been tested at higher temperatures.

PTable 5 presents a brief overview of the polyphosphazene mem-
branes that have been used at high-temperature GS process. Accord-
ing to this table, the addition of functional groups having aryl (e.g.,
phenol) and alkyl groups, singular bonded to oxygen (e.g., phenoxy
and ethoxy), on the ¡ P D N ¡ backbone increases the thermal stabil-
ity of the membranes. Fluorinated aryl and alkyl groups like trifluor-
oethoxy are assumed to make the polymer more stable, as discussed
in Section 5.1. Gas permeation results for some common polyphos-
phazene membranes are presented in Table 6.

PIn summary, Inorganic polymers were found to be mainly rub-
bery polymers with Tg values less than 0°C (silicon rubber and some
polyphosphazenes). These membranes could resist temperatures as
high as 200°C. This means that very high Tg might not always be
used as a criterion for evaluating the thermal stability of polymers. It
is worth noting that the Tg of polyphosphazenes was found to be
highly dependent on the type of the functional groups attached to
the ¡ P D N ¡ backbone, and can be a negative or a positive value.
Polyphosphazenes could be tailored to a specific application and
temperature tolerance threshold by applying suitable functional
groups. Most inorganic polymeric membranes which were success-
fully used at high temperatures were dense membranes synthesized
by the solution casting method. Phase separation technique was
rarely applied to make porous membranes with poly[bis(phenoxy)
phosphazene]
(PPOP) and poly[bis(cumylphenoxy)phosphazene]
(PCPOP) polymers [125,133]. Although the desired permeation

Ppolydihalidephosphazenes such as poly(dichlorophosphazene) and
poly(difluroorophosphazene). Generally, polydihalidephosphazenes
are synthesized by the ring-opening polymerization of a cyclic tri-
mer, e.g., hexachlorocyclophosphazatriene, followed by the substitu-
tion of the halide side-groups with various functional groups
through nucleophilic replacement (Fig. 17) [130]. These attached
pendant groups will yield polyphosphazenes with a variety of

Pproperties were not always obtained, the thermal and solvent stabil-
ity of these membranes (stability at 75°C and in acetone and hexane
for 45 days [125]) illustrates that polyphosphazenes can be used for
a wide range of specialty membrane applications.

5.3. Carbocyclic polymeric membranes

PCarbocyclic compounds are chemicals with homocyclic rings
composed exclusively of carbon atoms, e.g., benzene. The polymers
which consist of carbocyclic compounds, such as polyphenylenes,
polyethers, PSF, PAs, and polyesters, are called carbocyclic polymeric
membranes. The presence of carbocyclic groups with stabilized reso-
nance structures increases the bond strength and decreases the
polymer chain mobility, which consequently enhances the thermal
stability of the polymer.

PThe most well-known carbocyclic polymer used for the fabrica-
tion of membranes is PA. Thin film composite (TFC) PA membranes
(primarily used for water treatment applications) are generally
formed by the interfacial (in-situ) polymerization of amines (e.g., m-
phenylenediamine, MPD) and acyl chlorides (e.g., trimesoyl chloride,
TMC) on a microporous support. The temperature threshold for
these PA membranes is reported to be 45-50°C for extended opera-
tions. The main advantages of the interfacial polymerization reaction
are first forming a very thin PA film which reduces the resistance
against gas transport and second allowing the preparation of insolu-
ble PA membranes which cannot be prepared by the phase inversion
technique [146]. However, the limited selectivity of PA TFC mem-
branes for GS, e.g., separation of CO2 from CH4, due to the presence
of defects and less crosslinked regions in an ultrathin PA film as well
as their low thermal stability, have limited their application in GS
[146(cid:1)148]. Recent studies on highly crosslinked and thicker PA TFC
membranes showed promising separation performance (CO2/CH4
selectivity of 14(cid:1)28) that demonstrates the high potential of these

Pmembranes for CO2 separation [149,150]. For instance, Albo et al.
[150] reported 6 times increment in He permeability and He/N2
selectivity at 150 °C. They attributed this enhancement to the acti-
vated diffusion of He through the PA matrix at elevated tempera-
ture.

PPolyamides are classified into three main categories of aliphatic,
semi-aromatic, and fully aromatic. Aromatic polyamides are consid-
ered to be high-performance polymers due to their superior thermal
and mechanical properties, which makes them suitable for mem-
brane fabrication. García et al. [151] conducted a comprehensive
review on the high-performance PAs, a few of which could be proc-
essed into membranes. In some studies, relatively high CO2/CH4
selectivity (15(cid:1)30) was obtained [152,153]. However, aromatic PAs
have not explicitly been considered as membrane-forming materials
since they do not melt and insoluble or poorly soluble in strongly
polar organic solvents. The reason behind this drawback is related to
the PA inherent structural elements, e.g., a high degree of chain
rigidity of PA that justifies its high cohesive energy density (CED)
and molecular packing [147].

PPSF and PES are the most commonly used polymers for making
symmetric and asymmetric GS membranes, as wells as for the use as
support layers for composite membranes, owing to their excellent
processability and mechanical and thermal properties. The chemical
structures of these two polymers are shown in Fig. 18. Most of the
sulfone-based carbocyclic membranes currently available are fabri-
cated by Ultrason (BASF, Germany) and Radel and Udel (Solvay, Bel-
gium) PSF polymer derivatives. The outstanding processability of
PSF and PES polymers allows the formation of porous to dense struc-
tures by phase inversion and solution casting techniques, respec-
tively. Gas permeation results for PSF-based polymeric membranes
are presented in Table 7.

PPorous PSF and PES membranes are generally made by the phase
inversion technique, and their final properties are controlled by

Pchanging the preparation variables like polymer concentration,
coagulation bath temperature, and additives [162(cid:1)169]. Incorpo-
ration of additives, particularly polymeric additives like polyethyl-
ene glycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP),
is a common
method to change the morphology, pore size, and hydrophilicity of
PES and PSF membranes [22,170]. These additives remain in the
main polymer matrix after coagulation and affect the mechanical
strength and thermal stability of the membranes [171]. The incorpo-
ration of hydrophilic PEG and PVP additives, particularly those of
higher molecular weight, was found to increase the thermal stability
of PSF and PES membranes [171,172]. Based on these results, further
research has been directed toward making temperature resistant
polymer blends and MMMs by adding other high-performance poly-
mers (e.g., fluorinated polymers) and/or inorganic materials (e.g.,
nanoparticles) into the PSF and PES matrix, which will be discussed
later [173(cid:1)179]. The aim was to maintain the advantages of the out-
standing processability of PSF and PES polymers while enhancing
their mechanical and thermal properties, simultaneously.

PThe thermal stability of polymer blends and nanocomposite
membranes clearly depends on the type of additives and their load-
ing rate [180,181]. The addition of PAI into PES UF membrane was
found to significantly decrease the Tg, due to the lower Tg of PAI
[181]. Incorporating 0.5 wt.% of carbon nanotubes into a PES polymer
matrix was reported to increase the Tg owing to a reduction in the
mobility of the macromolecular segments. However, for higher load-
ings, Tg decreased due to less compatibility or less adhesion of the

Pnanotubes throughout the polymer matrix. The thermal stability
results were also verified by GS results, e.g., CO2/CH4 selectivity
increased from 51.26 for pure PES to 250.13 for 0.5 wt.% loading,
while 3.0 wt.% loading decreased the selectivity down to 5.04 [180].
PAnother technique used to improve PSF and PES polymers for GS
applications was to synthesize copolymers by using PSF and PES as
the base materials and adding additional polymers with higher per-
meation properties, like polyethylene oxide (PEO), into the backbone
[182]. As a matter of fact, making copolymers is a common tech-
nique to combine the permselectivity properties of two polymers.
For example, carbocyclic PA6-PEO (commercial name of PEBAX)
[183] and heterocyclic PI-PEO [184] are made to combine the diffu-
sivity selectivity of the main glassy polymer and the solubility selec-
tivity of PEO for improving CO2 selectivity in the GS process.

PPSF and PES membranes have been found to be easily modified
for further application in specialty membrane processes by attaching
various functional groups such as acid or base groups [185]. Depend-
ing on the type of attached groups, membrane processability, mainly
by the solution casting method, and permeation properties can be
tailored. The sulfonated polymers are commonly prepared by a slow
reaction of the polymer with a sulfonic acid (mainly chlorosulfonic
acid, ClSO3H), following the procedure suggested by Li and Chung
(Fig. 19) [186]. Although adding functionalizing groups was found to
enhance the permeation properties of the membranes, the thermal
stability of the membranes was found to decrease, depending on the
degree of functionalization [186(cid:1)188]. To overcome this drawback

Pwhile maintaining other improved properties like permselectivity,
cross-linkable polymers have been synthesized [188(cid:1)191]. Sulfo-
nated PES polymers with allyl or propargyl end-groups were found
to be thermally cross-linkable, which can enhance the thermal and
mechanical stability of the membranes [189,190].

PPEK and PEEK are carbocyclic polymers characterized by out-
standing chemical, thermal and mechanical properties. The continu-
ous working temperatures as high as 250°C make these polymers
good candidates for making high-temperature resistant membranes
[192,193]. However, these polymers have been found to be virtually
insoluble in all common solvents at room temperature, which
reduces their processability considerably [194]. PEK and PEEK
porous and dense membranes are typically made by the following
methods:

P1. Solid-state processing technique, e.g., rolltrusion, to make thin

films using commercially available bulk polymers [195];

P2. High-temperature dissolution of polymers and membrane fabri-
cation by the evaporation-induced phase separation (EIPS) tech-
nique [192,193,196];

P3. Dissolution in very strong acids such as liquid hydrogen fluoride
(HF), methanesulphonic acid (MeSO3H), trifluoromethane-sul-
phonic acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), followed by
membrane fabrication by the nonsolvent-induced phase separa-
tion (NIPS) technique [197,198];

P4. Modification of PEK and PEEK polymers by attaching cardo
groups to the backbone (PEEK-WC [199,200] and PEK-C
[201(cid:1)204]) and sulfone groups to the functional side chains (S-
PEEK) [205,206], to facilitate their solubility in common solvents
and consequently the fabrication of membranes by phase inver-
sion and solution casting techniques.

PIt must be noted that applying the last two methods would
slightly decrease the thermal stability of the membranes. The other
methods, however, result in thermally stable membranes for GS, as
presented in Table 8. PEK and PEEK membranes have been mainly
used in CO2 capturing processes where operating at higher tempera-
tures is necessary. It should be noted that PEEK membranes have
already been commercialized for GS applications.

PTaking a closer look at the chemical structure of carbocyclic poly-
mers, it can be seen that their thermal stability is mainly due to the
presence of at least one of ether, ester, amide, carbonyl, sulfone and
phenyl groups in the backbone of the polymer. Numerous studies
have been attempted to evaluate the relative stability of a variety of
linking groups [208]. Wright determined the thermal and thermoxi-
dative stability of linking groups in polymers with the general struc-
ture ( ¡ p ¡ C6H5 ¡ X ¡ )n [209]. Relative rankings of the linking
groups were assigned on the basis of the temperature at which a
25% weight loss occurred in a 2 h period, with or without oxygen.

a Temperature (°C) for 25% weight loss in 2 h without oxygen (thermal stability)

and with oxygen (thermal-oxidative stability).

PThe results of this study are summarized in Table 9. It is worth not-
ing that the amide linkage, which is the building block of PA mem-
branes, is highly ranked in both inert and oxidative environments.

PTherefore, any combination of these groups may result in a poly-
mer which can resist high temperatures. For instance, poly(arylene
ether ketone) (PAEK) [210(cid:1)212], poly (ether ketone) (PEEKK) [213],
poly (phenylenesulphide) (PPS) [188,214,215] and more compli-
cated combination of these groups [216,217] are used to make ther-
mally stable polymeric membranes.

PIn summary, carbocyclic polymers are the commercially available
polymers which are most widely applied in GS processes. The ther-
mal stability of the carbocyclic polymers is mainly due to the pres-
ence of
the carbocyclic group, with its stabilized resonance
structure, in the polymer backbone, which decreases the polymer
chain mobility. However, other groups like ether, carbonyl, and sul-
fone have also been found to improve the thermal stability of carbo-
cyclic polymers.
the commercial PA
membranes are mainly utilized for water treatment as they provide
poor GS performance due to their low density and presence of less
crosslinked regions in their network. In addition, these polymers
cannot be operated at temperatures higher than 45°C for extended
periods. The commercial PEEK membranes were also proved to be
less thermally stable than the conventional fluorinated Nafion poly-
mers [219]. Therefore, synthesizing novel thermally stable carbocy-
clic membranes by proper combination of groups mentioned above
is still a wide-open research area.

It must be noted that

PA heterocyclic compound is defined as any organic compound
that has atoms of at least two different elements (mostly C, N, and S)
on its ring. Membranes made from polymers having at least one het-
erocyclic ring in their repeating units, such as PIs and polytriazole,
inflexible
are called heterocyclic polymeric membranes. Long,
repeating units comprising heterocyclic rings offer conjugated rigid
structures with high Tg and exceptional stiffness, allowing excellent
resistance to harsh environments [220].

PAmong heterocyclic polymers, PIs have been studied the most
for membrane GS applications, particularly for CO2 separation
(Table 10). According to the structure of their main chains, PIs can be
aliphatic (linear) or aromatic; the latter is the most widely used due
to their higher thermal stability. Aromatic heterocyclic PIs are typi-
cal of most commercial PIs, such as Ultem from GE and DuPont's
Kapton. Numerous types of PIs have been synthesized by attaching
various functional and linkage groups to improve their mechanical
and thermal properties as well as their processability. Among these
PIs, organo-soluble ones have been widely used to make dense
membranes by solution casting techniques [221,222]. However,
other techniques like phase inversion [223(cid:1)226] and interfacial
polymerization [227] have also been used to fabricate porous and
dense membranes for GS applications at high temperatures. Similar
to carbocyclic PEEK polymers, sulfonated PIs have also been synthe-
sized and used for high-temperature applications [228(cid:1)233].

PCostello and Koros [240] studied the permeability and solubility
of He, N2, O2, CO2, CH4 in two commercial PI isomers (Hoechst
Celanese Corporation) over an extensive temperature range from
35(cid:1)325°C. The constant activation energy of sorption, diffusion, and
permeation as well as linear permselectivity behavior as shown in
Fig. 20, was indicative of the high performance of these membranes
at elevated temperatures.

PLong-term operation of PI membranes at high temperatures and
pressures was found to decrease their performance due to plasticiza-
tion by high-pressure CO2 and heavy hydrocarbons in GS process.
This phenomenon causes softening and a reduction of the Tg of the
polymer (decreasing the thermal stability), and subsequently an
increase in permeability, but a reduction in selectivity [223]. To
avoid polymer plasticization and to maintain the thermal stability
of PI membranes for a long-term operation, several approaches
such as polymer blending [241,242], inorganic-polymer blending

P[243(cid:1)246], incorporating inorganics into polymer blends [178,247],
and crosslinking [241,246] have been applied. All of
these
approaches have been found to improve the performance of GS at
elevated temperatures.

PThe most important derivative of PI is polyetherimide (PEI),
which is made by adding an ether linkage to the polymer backbone
(Fig. 21). PEI is a low-cost, high-performance engineered thermo-
plastic polymer (Tg D 216°C) with characteristics similar to PEEK, but
less thermally stable. PEI's characteristics include outstanding
mechanical strength and high rigidity at elevated temperatures,
long-term heat resistance, and dimensional stability. Creep resis-
tance over long times enables the application of PEI membrane in
many industrial separation processes. PEI has balanced physico-
chemical properties between practicability and performance owing
to the introduction of ether group in its backbone (Fig. 21). Gallucci
and Malinoski [248] illustrated that the presence of anhydride end
groups has a significant effect on the Tg (258°C) and thermal stability
of polyetherimide sulfone (PEIS) polymers. PEI polymer has been

Pused for the fabrication of membranes, particularly dense mem-
branes for GS; however, no records for high-temperature application
of these membranes were found in peer-reviewed publications.

PPBI is undoubtedly the most widely applied heterocyclic polymer
for the preparation of thermally stable membranes. This polymer is
typically synthesized by a polymerization reaction between dicar-
boxylic acid monomers and 3,30,4,40-tetraaminobiphenyl (TAB) as
shown in Fig. 22. PBI polymers possess a very high Tg of 425(cid:1)436°C
and excellent thermal and chemical stability [78], which makes
them suitable for high-temperature processes. The high Tg of PBI
limits its processability. However, PBI exhibits sufficient solubility in
strong oxo-acid (e.g., phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid) and some
aprotic solvents (such as DMAc, DMF, and NMP) that makes fiber
extrusion and casting methods feasible [249]. PBI solubility charac-
teristics in various solvents are listed in Table 11. The PBI derivatives
exhibit enhanced solubility in common aprotic solvents compared
to m-PBI, which is due to the incorporation of bulky, high-mobility
or twisted functional groups into the PBI backbone. At high tempera-

Ptures, all derivatives exhibit higher solubility in LiCl/DMAc and

PPBI changes from a thermoplastic polymer to a thermoset resin at
around 450°C, and after heat treatment at 500°C,
it becomes
completely insoluble in all solvents [78]. Pristine fibers of PBI were
shown to have excellent mechanical properties. However, the water
molecules bound to the amine and imine nitrogen of PBI and thus
soften these fibers. The tenacity of PBI fibers increases by increasing
the temperature from ambient to 100°C and remains constant up to
200°C. Further increase in temperature was found to decrease the
mechanical properties of fibers significantly [252].

PPBI membranes are mainly fabricated by the solution casting
method. Li et al. [253] divided this method into two categories
according to the applied solvent: (i) acid-cast membranes, (ii) apro-
tic solvent-cast membranes doped with polyphosphoric acid (PPAc).
The solution casting method involves polymer solution casting, dry-
ing at 50-150°C and finally, in some cases, curing at high tempera-
tures (300-500°C). PBI is dissolvable in strong acids and a few
aprotic solvents. Because of the close chain packing of the PBI
polymer resulting from the structural rigidity and strong hydrogen
bonding, dense PBI membranes can be easily made by solution evap-
oration [253]. PBI membranes produced by solution evaporation

Phave been mainly used in GS [254(cid:1)262]. Acid-cast fabricated mem-
branes were found to be more rubbery and softer than the aprotic
solvent-cast membranes. [253]. The general procedure for the syn-
thesis of PBI by using PPAc is shown in Fig. 23. The reaction between
tetraaminobiphenyl (TAB) and para/meta isophthalic acid (IPA) in
the presence of PPAc leads to formation para/meta-PBI. He et al.
[252] observed an increase in H2 and O2 permeabilities through an
acid-doped PBI membrane. H2 permeability values for neat- and
acid-doped PBI membranes at 120(cid:1)180°C were 1.6(cid:1)4.3 £ 10¡17 and
1.2(cid:1)4.0 £ 10¡15 mol cm¡2 s¡1 Pa¡1, respectively while for O2 they
were 5.0(cid:1)10 £ 10¡19 and 3.0(cid:1)9.4 £ 10¡16 mol cm¡2 s¡1 Pa¡1,
respectively. Acid-doped PBI membranes, as fully aromatic heterocy-
clic membranes, showed a slight improvement in stress at break-
point because of the strong interaction between the imidazole rings
and the phosphoric acid molecules at temperatures up to 125°C.

PSome PBI membranes which were used for high-temperature GS
applications are summarized in Table 12. Pesiri et al. [254] applied
PBI membranes for the separation of H2, CH4, and CO2 at tempera-
tures above 340°C. They showed that PBI membranes had extremely
low flux for H2 and CH4 at room temperature, whereas at tempera-
tures above 150°C, gas permeation increased but the selectivity with
respect to CO2 decreased. In a pure gas permeation test, when tem-
perature increased from 25 to 340°C, H2 permeability enhanced
from 0.09 to 18 Barrer while CO2 permeability increased from 0.01
to 4 Barrer. The reduction of H2/CO2 selectivity with temperature is
not in agreement with other theoretical and experimental studies
(Fig. 2) that suggest increase in overall selectivity due to the signifi-
cant decrease in solubility of more condensable gas at higher tem-
perature [32]. Pesiri et al. attributed this result to the most
significant role of the diffusivity-based permeation properties at
higher temperatures in the rigid structure of PBI. Kumbharkar et al.
[258] and Berchtold et al. [257] reported the same behavior for gas
permeation and selectivity in response to increasing temperatures.

PIn another study, Kumbharkar et al. [259] studied the effect of
changing the PBI polymer structure on the thermal and CO2 separa-
tion properties of synthesized membranes. They used different
monomers and showed that the incorporation of hexafluoroisopro-
pylidene and tertbutyl groups decreased thermal stability slightly.
Asymmetric HFMs were synthesized by dry-jet wet spinning
method. By increasing the temperature from 400°C to 25°C, a signifi-
cant increase in H2 permeability (nearly 8 times), but a minor
enhancement in CO2 permeability (almost twice) was observed.

POther types of heterocyclic polymers have also been utilized for
making temperature resistant polymeric membranes. Gebben et al.
[43] prepared a polytriazole membrane for GS applications. The
chemical structure of this polymer is shown in Fig. 24. Due to the
high solubility of the synthesized polytriazole polymer in formic
acid phase-inversion technique (precipitation by solvent evapora-
tion) was used to fabricate the membranes [43]. Polytriazole was
first dissolved in formic acid at room temperature. Then, thin films
were cast on a glass plate using a casting knife with a 0.15 mm slit
height. Homogeneous films were obtained by evaporating the sol-
vent at 80 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. After that, the films were
removed from the glass plate with water. Finally, the membranes
were dried in a vacuum oven at 150°C for at least 24 h. The thickness
of the films varied between 20 and 30 mm.

PGebben et al. [43] investigated effects of higher temperatures on
O2, N2, and He permeabilities as well as He/N2 and O2/N2 selectiv-
ities. They showed that increasing the temperature up to 200°C led
to a considerable increase in the permeability and a decrease in the
He/N2 and O2/N2 ideal selectivities, from about 120 and 10, at room
temperature to about 25 and 3 at 200°C, respectively. They also
examined the influence of operating time on the durability of mem-
branes at various temperatures. Measuring permeabilities of He,
CO2, CH4, and N2 over time, they showed that these values remained
constant for a period of at least 2 months.

PIn summary, outstanding thermal and mechanical properties
of heterocyclic polymers, which originate from their inflexible
aromatic backbone, make these classes of polymers suitable candi-
dates for high-temperature membrane preparation. However, the
enhanced thermoxidative stability of heterocyclic polymers is offset
by their low fusibility or solubility properties. The processability of
these polymers has been improved by incorporating linking groups
between the aromatic/heterocyclic rings and the pendant functional
groups to synthesize organo-soluble polymers. PI and PBI are the
most widely utilized heterocyclic polymers for membrane prepara-
tion. The synthesized membranes by these polymers were mostly
nonporous and were primarily applied for the GS applications. The
thermally stable heterocyclic polymers have high potential to
replace common PSF, PES, PTFE, and PVDF membranes for high-tem-
perature applications.

5.5. Ladder polymeric membranes

PIn ladder polymers, the concept of hetero-aromatic polymers has
been extended to “double-strand” structures where two or more lin-
ear polymer backbones are regularly cross-linked, thus forming a
system of fused rings [268]. Ladder polymers have the advantages of
higher mechanical strength and thermal, chemical, and radiation
stabilities than linear polymers of the analogous composition. This
difference is attributed to the fact that a linear polymer can be bro-
ken with the cleavage of only one bond on the main chain, whereas
for the ladder polymers the cleavage of two or more adjacent bonds
is required [269]. However, Critchley [268] reported that, in practice,
ladder polymers show little or no improvement over the best of the
conventional hetero-aromatic polymers, most probably due to
incomplete ladder formation during polymer synthesis.

PLadder polymers are made with aromatic cycles or heterocycles
that make them resistant to heat, light, radiation, and chemical
reagents. These polymers are difficult to process as they are mostly
insoluble and infusible. Ladder polymers can be divided into three
categories depending on the chemical composition of the main
chain: organic (carbocyclic and heterocyclic), hetero-organic, or
inorganic. They can be synthesized by either cyclization of the corre-
sponding linear polymers or by direct polymerization or polycon-
densation of monomers. The most well-known ladder polymers
which have been used for membrane preparation are (i) polypyrro-
lones [270(cid:1)273], (ii) spirobisindane-based polymers of intrinsic
microporosity (PIMs) [274(cid:1)282], and (iii) poly(bisbenzimidazo-ben-
zophenanthrolines) (BBL) [283,284]. Chemical structures of typical
polymers in each of these categories are shown in Fig. 26. The ladder
polymers have been mainly used to prepare GS membranes. There is
no rotational freedom in the polymer backbone, resulting in a large
free volume, and consequently higher gas permeation compared to
common glassy polymer membranes.

PThe literature search yielded few records on the use of ladder
polymeric membranes for high-temperature applications. Costello
et al. [270] synthesized dense polypyrrolone membranes by solution
casting of a hexafluorodianhydride-3,3 0,4,40-tetraaminodiphenyl
oxide (6FDA-TADPO) polymer (Fig. 26) in DMAc solvent. Gas trans-
port and sorption of the synthesized membranes were tested at tem-
peratures as high as 200°C. The permeability of He, CO2, O2, N2 and
CH4 gases was found to increase with increased temperature, while
He/N2, CO2/CH4, and O2/N2 selectivities decreased. The permeability
data followed Arrhenius behavior over most of the temperature
range studied, however, some curvature was observed at tempera-
tures higher than 125°C, which implies high thermal stability of the
applied polypyrrolone membrane up to this temperature.

PGao and Lu [271] synthesized a polypyrrolone step ladder poly-
mer (a polymer comprised of a certain number of bridged phenylene
rings as the repeating unit) derived from 2,20-bis (p -trimethoxy-
3,30-
phenyl) hexafluoropropane

dianhydride

PPoly(phthalazinone ether sulfone ketone) (PPESK) copolymers,
whose Tg’s are in the range of 263(cid:1)305°C, display high thermal sta-
bility. The chemical structure of this polymer is shown in Fig. 25.
Membranes prepared from PPESK exhibited excellent separation
properties with outstanding thermal stability [58,264,265]. Dai et al.
[264-266] sulfonated the PPESK membranes to enhance their solu-
bility in common aprotic solvents and subsequently modify their
processability. DLS measurements showed that the synthesized
sulfonated PPESK (SPPESK) membranes had higher Tg than pure
PPESK membranes (maximum 323°C in SPPESK depending on the
degree of sulfonation compared to 278°C in PPESK). In addition, the
incorporation of more ¡ SO3H groups into the PPESK caused the Tg
to increase linearly.

PJian et al. [267] also synthesized a series of PPESK copolymers
with different Tg values (263(cid:1)305°C) by polycondensation reaction
and used them for the preparation of dense membranes by the EIPS
technique. The polymer was dissolved in NMP and then cast on a
glass plate in a dust-free environment. Freshly cast films were first
heated for 24 h at 80°C and then for 24 h at 100°C. Polymer films
were finally removed from the glass plate. Gas permeability and
selectivity of the synthesized membranes for CO2, O2, and N2 were
determined at temperatures up to 66°C. The permeability of CO2, O2,
and N2 through the membrane was 4.121, 0.674, and 0.0891 Barrer,
respectively. The selectivity of O2 and CO2 over N2 was found to be
7.6 and 46, respectively. As the temperature increased, the perme-
ability increased, but CO2/N2 and O2/N2 selectivity decreased. The
constant activation energy of gas permeation with temperature indi-
cated that the synthesized PPESK membranes remained in glass state
within the temperature limit of 25 to 66°C. Accordingly, Jian et al.
[267] predicted a promising prospect of PPESK as the potential
membrane material for high-temperature GS.

Ppermeability of various gases over this range suggested high thermal
stability of this membrane.

PPIM-1 is a rigid, high free-volume (FFV D 0.26), glassy, spirobisin-
dane-based ladder polymer with excellent chemical stability and
reasonable solvent resistance. Membranes made by PIM-1 were
found to provide very high gas permeability (6500 Barrer for CO2 to
25,100 Barrer for n-C4H10) and selectivity (19 for CO2/N2 to 74 for
n-C4H10/N2) [274]. These properties make them suitable as an
advanced microporous polymeric membrane material for the sepa-
ration of organic vapor/permanent gas mixtures in natural gas appli-
cations. The activation energies for diffusion, permeation, and the
enthalpy of sorption of different gases in various thermally stable
membranes are compared in Table 13. It can be seen that the value
of the activation energy for diffusion for all membranes ranges from
0.6 to 10 kcal/mol. Taking a closer look at these results, it can be con-
cluded that the membranes with higher Tg and FFV, provide lower
gas diffusivity upon operating temperature. The value of the
enthalpy of sorption for all membranes changes between ¡5.3 to
¡1.0 kcal/mol. The negative enthalpy of sorption shows that, based
on Eq. 5, the gas sorption reduces at elevated temperatures [282]. Li
et al. [282] prepared PIM-1 membranes and tested them for GS in
the temperature range of 25(cid:1)55°C. The constant activation energy
of permeation was observed for lighter gases (He, H2, N2, O2, CH4,
and CO2) at different pressures, while for the heavier hydrocarbons
(C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8), activation energy varied, with a less-clear
trend owing to the varying effects of plasticization.

PThomas et al. [274] prepared PIM-1 membrane films by gradually
pouring a 2 wt.% polymer/chloroform solution into a flat-bottomed
glass petri dish, then drying at 70°C. The synthesized PIM-1 mem-
branes showed excellent properties for the separation of heavier
hydrocarbons from lighter ones. As can be observed in Fig. 27,
n-C4H10/CH4 selectivity of PIM-1 is similar to that of PTMSP mem-
branes and about 2.5-fold higher than that of PDMS membranes. The
linear Arrhenius relationship for the permeability of H2, He, O2, N2,
CO2, CH4, and C4H10 over a temperature range of 0-55°C (constant
activation energy of permeation) showed the thermal stability of the
membrane at temperatures as high as 55°C.

PTo enhance the separation properties of PIM-1 membranes while
maintaining their thermal stability, approaches like (i) making poly-
mer blends by using common PIs [289,290], (ii) fabricating hybrid

the precursor solutions (BTFDA and DAB monomers in DMAc sol-
vent) on glass plates and drying them for 1 h at 60°C. Thermal con-
version of the films was then performed by heating in an oven for
1 h at 100(cid:1)300°C under argon. The permeabilities of H2, O2, and N2,
in the synthesized BTFDA-DAB polypyrrolone membrane, were
found to be 4.6, 6.9, and 8.3 times less than those for similar PI het-
erocyclic membrane (6FDA-DAB), respectively, whereas the selectiv-
ity of H2/N2 and O2/N2 increased by 65% and 19%, respectively. The
gas permeation through BTFDA-DAB membrane was studied in the
temperature range of 30(cid:1)90°C. The linear Arrhenius correlations of

Pseen, the transport properties of all membranes fell below or on the
upper limit of performance. The combination of a rigid structure and
tight chain packing resulted in an extremely low O2 permeability in
BBL (0.021 Barrer) as compared to other ladder polymers. However,
the high 6FDA(cid:1)TADPO permeability pushed its performance to the
upper bound trade-off line, as shown in Fig. 28.

PZhou and Lu [284] synthesized two other types of BBL polymers
by polycondensation of 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhy-
dride (NTDA) with 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and with 3,304,40-
tetraaminodiphenyl ether (TADPE). The NTDA-DAB has the same
structure as NTDA-TADPE, but without ether linkage at the end of
the repeating unit. The membrane films were prepared by casting
the monomer solution in DMAc on a glass plate and drying at 85°C
for 1 h. The synthesized membranes were then tested by TGA as well
as H2, O2, and N2 gas permeation tests. Based on TGA results, the
presence of the ether bond in NTDA-TADPE decreased the thermal
stability slightly (the decomposition temperature in N2 reduced
from 636°C in NTDA-DAB to 619°C in NTDA-TADPE). Both mem-
branes exhibited excellent tensile strength, and the NTDA-TADPE
polymer film possessed a higher elongation-at-break than that of
the NTDA-DAB film due to the presence of ether linkage in its back-
bone. The permeability of H2, O2, and N2 in NTDA-DAB was substan-
tially higher than that in NTDA-TADPE (e.g., H2 permeability was
14.9 and 6.0 Barrer for NTDA-DAB and NTDA-TADPE, respectively).
H2/N2 and O2/N2 selectivities were almost similar (123(cid:1)146 and
7.1(cid:1)7.7, respectively). Therefore, NTDA-DAB was suggested as a bet-
ter candidate for GS applications.

PIn summary, ladder polymers including polypyrrolones, PIMs and
BBLs possess thermal stability at temperatures above 500°C, and
therefore they have been investigated as high-performance poly-
mers for high-temperature membrane GS applications. Their high
thermal stability is attributed to the rigidity of the main polymer
chain and the need for cleavage of at least two bonds in such double
strand structures. These rigid membranes have been made in a broad
range of low permeation/high selectivity polypyrrolones and BBLs
and high permeation/low selectivity PIMs. The solubility of ladder
polymers also varies widely from very high solubility in weak
organic solvents (chloroform, dichloromethane, and THF) in the case
of PIMs, and very low solubility in strong aprotic solvents (NMP,
DMAc, and DMF) in the case of polypyrrolones and BBL. The high sol-
ubility of PIMs in organic solvents allows them to have potential use
in large-scale membrane preparation. For polypyrrolones and BBL,
the typical method to make membrane films is to dissolve mono-
mers in aprotic solvents, cast the solution, and let the polymeriza-
tion reaction occur at the post-treatment stage by increasing the
temperature.

5.6. Polymer blend membranes

PPolymer blending is achieved by mixing two or more polymers,
which are not covalently bonded, to create a new material with dif-
ferent physical properties. Polymer blends are mainly divided into
three subcategories,
including miscible, partially miscible and
immiscible blends. Mixing of two or more miscible polymers produ-
ces homogenous blend polymers while heterogeneous blending is
achieved by mixing two or more polymers that are partially misci-
ble. To achieve the optimum blending ratio, the two polymers are
mixed at various composition ratios and then the permeation prop-
erties of the membranes are measured to find the optimum point
[294].

PA high-temperature-resistant polymer can be blended either
with common polymers or other thermally stable polymers. As
an example, Tables 14 and 15 present PI and PA blends with spe-
cialty polymers, respectively. Blended polymers are found to be
modified in one or more targeted parameters including thermal,
thermos-oxidative, mechanical, and chemical stability as well as

Pmembranes [291,292], and (iii) thermal crosslinking of the polymer
[293] have also been tried.

PZimmerman and Koros [283] synthesized BBL ladder polymer
from 1,2,4,5-tetraaminobenzene tetrahydrochloride (TABH) and
1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid (NTCA) and compared its
gas permeation properties with some polypyrrolone type polymers.
The permeability and sorption of He, O2, N2, CO2, and CH4 were mea-
sured at different temperatures (35(cid:1)80°C). They observed linear
Arrhenius type behavior for both permeability and solubility of gases
in the BBL membrane over this temperature range. Comparing the
performance of the BBL membrane with a typical polypyrrolone
(6FDA-TADPO) membrane, it was found that O2 and N2 activation
energies for permeation in BBL were over 100% greater than
those in 6FDA(cid:1)TADPO. This was attributed to the higher FFV of
6FDA(cid:1)TADPO compared to BBL (70% more) that enabled gas mole-
cules to permeate with less resistance and thus decreased the activa-
tion energies for permeation in 6FDA(cid:1)TADPO. Even though BBL
showed a slightly higher O2/N2 selectivity than 6FDA(cid:1)TADPO (6.6
compared to 4.8), the latter was suggested as the superior candidate
for GS process due to its higher permeability. The Robeson trade-off
plot for the tested ladder membrane is shown in Fig. 28. As can be

perature polymer blends in order of increasing CUT from 110°C to

PThe thermal behavior of various polymer blends was investigated
by Lizymol and Thomas [297] to compare the thermal properties of
miscible and immiscible systems. They used three blend systems,
(PVC/
namely, poly(vinyl chloride)/poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile)
SAN), poly(vinyl chloride)/poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)
(PVC/
EVA), and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)/poly(styrene-co-acryloni-
trile) (EVA/SAN). The thermal stability of the completely miscible
PVC/EVA blend system was found to improve significantly. TGA
showed that adding EVA can improve the initial decomposition tem-
perature and the overall thermal stability of PVC while the impact of
blending on thermal stability of PVC/SAN and EVA/SAN blends is
much less.

PYang et al. [298] evaluated chitosan/PVA blended membranes by
DSC, TGA, and DMA analysis, and found that 1) the thermal stability
of the membranes increased when formaldehyde was used as the
crosslinking agent; 2) the compatibility of PVA and chitosan was
low, and 3) the crystalline area in PVA decreased after treatment
with formaldehyde.

PKurdi and Kumar [299] prepared semi-interpenetrating polymer
networks (semi-IPNs) by in-situ polymerization of bismaleimide
(BMI) in thermoplastic polyetherimide (PEI) as well as PSF. The pro-
posed sol-gel synthesis technique enables arresting thermoplastic/
thermoset phase separation at an initial stage by solidifying the
semi-IPNs by nonsolvent-induced phase inversion. Membranes
formed from semi-IPN had low density and their skin layers were

Pthinner as compared to their thermoplastic base polymer. DSC and
TGA analyses indicated that the Tg of these semi-IPN membranes
was increased. The air separation experiments showed these semi-
IPN membranes, with their improved structure and morphology,
have excellent separation performance as compared to base poly-
mers. The membrane permeability enhanced by 12(cid:1)15 folds with-
out a substantial reduction in the O2/N2 selectivity.

POne of the interesting applications of polymer blends is to make
carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes [300(cid:1)302]. The CMS
membranes have excellent thermal stability over the wide tempera-
ture range of 500(cid:1)1000°C [303]. Using polymer blends leads to the
formation of CMS membranes with two different porous carbon
structures. Experimental data from several sources have identified
that the decomposition of thermally stable polymers creates micro-
pores below 2 nm, while the thermally labile polymer leads to the
formation of mesopores in the range of 2(cid:1)50 nm. The gas perme-
ation performance of the CMS membranes derived from blend poly-
mers that contain thermally labile polymers was found to improve
significantly [304]. Phase-separated polymer blends are being inves-
tigated as suitable materials for preparing mesoporous carbon struc-
tures. These types of membranes have been widely used for the
development of catalyst support and liquid/gas phase adsorbents
applications [305], while their performance in the separation of
small gas molecules is poor. However, ultra-microporous (< 5 A
) car-
bon membranes were found to exhibit reasonable ideal selectivity
for various combinations of gases [300].

to integrate the positive features of at least two polymers while

directly relates to miscibility of polymers and the homogeneity of
the final polymer blend. Membranes made by polymer blends were
mainly utilized for proton exchanging in fuel cells and their potential
application for high-temperature GS needs further investigations.

5.7. Mixed matrix membranes

PThe main restriction of polymeric membranes that are not able to
endure high temperature has brought a lot of consideration to
improve their properties by embedding inorganic fillers into the
polymer matrix. The use of functionalized nanomaterials to synthe-
size mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with the aim of changing
the physicochemical properties of membranes has been widely
investigated [306,307]. The general idea for the synthesis of MMMs
is to induce the thermal, electrical, mechanical, and molecular sieve
properties of these nanomaterials to the base membrane. Such
hybrid membrane are fabricated by the homogeneous incorporation
of chemically and thermally stable inorganic materials such as metal
oxide nanoparticle (TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), zeolites, carbon-based
nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, graphene oxides, and cellulose
nanocrystals), MOFs into the thermally stable polymers such as
those mentioned in this study.

PMMMs combine the advantages of the superior separation prop-
the nanofillers with the polymer's processability
erties of
[308(cid:1)313]. The rigid inorganic fillers, when incorporated into
almost all polymers, can decrease the mobility of the polymer chains
and maintain the membrane's selectivity at elevated temperature. In
addition, it is well known that the introduction of inorganic fillers
into the polymers enhances the mechanical and thermal resistance
of the polymer composites, and therefore, enable their application at
elevated operating temperatures. However, the incorporation of
nanomaterials to a polymer film, with the aim of fabricating a robust
hybrid membrane, may not induce the desired functionality to the

Ppolymer and even deteriorate its permeation properties. The major
challenges to this are the severe aggregation of the nanomaterials
and the weak compatibility of NPs with polymers [314]. These two
phenomena lead to the formation of non-selective voids at the inter-
face of the polymer and nanomaterials, which significantly reduces
the rejection percentage [315]. Also, the desired thermal stability
might not achieved, since the reduction in chain mobility by the
addition of nanomaterials is mitigated by the formation of these
voids. Tg of MMMs is an important property to screen. MMMs that
have high Tg are favorable particularly for high-temperature GS pro-
cesses. When a good interfacial adhesion exists between the poly-
mer and the inorganic fillers, the Tg of the MMMs is expected to
increase. Usually, the Tg values of the MMMs are slightly higher than
that of unfilled membranes [316]. Although MMMs have been exten-
sively examined for the GS during the past two decades, only a few
of these studies were intended to reveal the thermal stability of
these membranes. Table 17 presents a list of MMMs, which have
been used for the high-temperature H2/CO2 separation.

PA block copolymer comprised of rigid and flexible segments is a
promising candidate for the development of MMMs. The flexible
segment of the block copolymer improves interfacial adhesion,
while the rigid segment provides higher selectivity and heat resis-
tance [321]. Pechar et al. [321] prepared an MMM using PDMS-
6FpDA block copolymer and zeolite L. A good dispersion of zeolite
into the copolymers was observed and the polymer was not sepa-
rated from the zeolite. The membrane permeability was increased
for He, CO2, O2, N2, and CH4 gases with the use of 22 and 41 wt.%
PDMS in the block copolymer. However, the addition of zeolite into
the polymer matrix was found to decrease both gas permeability
and CO2/CH4 selectivity. The CO2 permeability for 6FDA(cid:1)6Fp-
DA(cid:1)PDMS (41 wt.% PDMS) membrane was 229.34 Barrer and for the
corresponding 20 wt.% zeolite L MMM was 199.41 Barrer. The rele-
vant CO2/CH4 selectivity for pristine membrane was 5.47 and for the
corresponding MMM was 4.79.

PMembranes containing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have
been investigated for use in high-temperature and high-pressure GS
applications. Basu et al. [316,322] prepared dense and asymmetric
MMMs by solvent evaporation and phase inversion with Matrimid(cid:1)
and Matrimid(cid:1)/PSF blends as base polymers and three different
MOFs: [Cu3(BTC)2], ZIF-8 and MIL-53(Al) as fillers, to improve
the membrane GS performance. Incorporation of the fillers in the
polymeric membrane resulted in an improvement in thermal and
mechanical stability. Both dense and asymmetric MMMs of all
three MOFs exhibited enhanced CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity as
compared with the pristine membrane. The thermal stability of
[Cu3(BTC)2], ZIF-8 and MIL-53(Al) was analyzed by TGA and
showed stability up to 300, 436 and 500°C, respectively. The thermal
decomposition (Td) of the pure Matrimid(cid:1) polyimide starts at
around 487°C. This value increased up to 495, 496 and 500°C for
MMMs with 30 wt.% loading of [Cu3(BTC)2], MIL-53(Al) and ZIF-8,
respectively. The improvement in thermal stability of the MMMs is
due to the high thermal stability of the MOFs and the strong interac-
tions between the MOFs and the polymer matrix [323,324].

PZIF/PBI MMMs is one of the most commonly used types of mem-
branes for GS at elevated temperature. Yang et al. [317] mixed the
as-synthesized ZIF-7 nanoparticles without the conventional drying
process with PBI. The resultant MMMs had a very high ZIF-7 content
(as high as 50 wt.%), and exhibited high mechanical and thermal sta-
bility, together with increased H2 permeability and ideal H2/CO2
selectivity, compared to pure PBI membranes. Mixed gas permeation
was carried out from room temperature to 180°C. A significant
enhancement in H2 permeation was seen, but without compromis-
ing H2/CO2 selectivity (Fig. 29). Yang and Chung [318] also prepared
ZIF-8/PBI MMMs for high-temperature H2 separation from CO and
water vapor. The MMMs exhibited high thermal and separation
stability under harsh conditions, with significant H2 permeability
and H2/CO2 selectivity at 230°C, indicating that impurities such as
CO and H2O have a remarkable effect on membrane performance.
The Intercalation phenomenon takes place when the ZIF-8 content
reaches 63.6 vol.%.

PAhn et al. [326] examined the gas transport and sorption proper-
ties of PIM-1/fumed silica MMMs and observed that overall gas
permeability of He, H2, O2, N2, and CO2 increased significantly and
nonlinearly with increasing nano-silica content. They also investi-
gated the changes in free volume as well as the volume of the
void cavities, with various levels of silica nanoparticle content by

Panalyzing the thermal stability, density, and nano-structural mor-
phology. The enhancement in gas permeability was attributed to the
fact that the significant increase in the void cavities, created by the
addition of impermeable nano-fumed silica, was greater than the
permeable space of the unfilled polymer chain packing.

PThe thermal stability results for the nanocomposite membranes
are compared to pristine membranes in Table 18. The results demon-
strate that the thermal stability of the PBI-based nanocomposite
membranes remains principally unchanged regardless of whether
the thermal decomposition atmosphere is in syngas or He. Ultem-
derived membranes are somewhat less thermally stable than PBI in
a reducing gas atmosphere. Moreover, the short-term exposure of
the PBO-based membranes to syngas tends to decrease polymer
thermal stability slightly for all four membranes. PBO prepared by
thermal transformation at 400°C is somewhat less stable than that
transformed at 450°C in syngas while for exposure in the air exactly
opposite result is obtained. The decomposition onset temperature
values for the PBI/SiO2 nanocomposite membrane is much higher
than that of the Ultem/SiO2 nanocomposite and PBO/SiO2 nanocom-
posite in a syngas environment [327].

PThe TGA curves of PBI, Ultem 1000, and PBO nanocomposite
membranes containing silica nanoparticles in both helium and syn-
gas environments are compared in Fig. 30. As can be observed, incor-
poration of SiO2 nanoparticle provided more heat resistance to PBI
than PBO or Ultem. The thermal degradation value for the PBI/SiO2
hybrid membrane (Td » 568°C in syngas) was much higher than that
of the PBO/SiO2 (Td » 466°C in syngas) and the Ultem/SiO2 mem-
brane (Td » 508°C in syngas) [327]. Two possible explanations for
this result may be the higher thermal stability of PBI than PBO and
Ultem, and better compatibility of SiO2 in the PBI polymer matrix.

PIn recent years, there has been a significant advancement in the
field of MMMs involving polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane
(POSS). POSS belongs to a special class of functional nanosize fillers
consisting of silicon and oxygen atoms. It has a unique cage-like
structure and its general chemical composition is (RSiO1.5)n (n D 4,
6, 8, 10. . .), with R as an organic functional group. The addition of
POSS nanoparticles within polymer matrices results in improved
thermal and mechanical stability of the polymers, improved heat

Presistance, and increased Tg because of the rigid structures of the
POSS cage. The thermal stability of POSS-containing membranes
depends on the POSS content in the polymer, the POSS-polymer sur-
face interactions and crosslinking. The POSS moieties within the
polymer matrix can improve the local molecular topology, the local
molecular interactions, and the polymer mobility. This microscopic
improvement is manifested in the macroscopic performance and
physical properties such as Tg, and thermal and mechanical stability.

PThere are many ways to form a POSS-containing polymeric nano-
composite, such as physically blending, covalent binding within the
polymer backbone, and incorporating them as pendant groups on
the polymer chain [328].

PIn summary, the fabrication of hybrid membranes by the incor-
poration of inorganic fillers into high-performance polymers offers
an exciting opportunity to overcome the drawbacks of both materi-
als (e.g., low thermal stability of polymers and poor processability of

Pthe simulation results, it is possible to control H2 recovery, CO con-
version, permeate and residual gas compositions, and incremental
relative membrane area as H2 is removed along the length of the
membrane reactor/separator (Fig. 32) [327].

PMembrane reactor module simulations demonstrate that 6 - 8 m2
of PBI membrane area would be required for a 10-L/min H2 mem-
brane module at 300°C. The manufacturing cost for a typical ther-
mally-stable-membrane based module must consider the cost of the
support tubes, which is typically in the range of $100 to 150/ft2. The
cost of preparing a PBI/AccuSep composite membrane would then
be at least $150/ft2. The capital cost of a 7 m2 area membrane mod-
ule generating 10 L/min of H2 would be around $11,300, or around
$533/(ft3/h H2) [327].

PThe costs related the PBI membrane system are compared to that
of Pd-based membrane module developed by United States Depart-
ment of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE/
NETL). The costs and H2 flux of the metallic membrane (at 400°C and
20 psi) in 2010 were reported to be $1000/ft2 and 200 scf h ft-2,
respectively. Therefore, the membrane module cost for an H2 unit
must be $5/(ft3/h H2). Obviously, a support-based PBI membrane
module is nearly two orders of magnitude above the DOE's cost tar-
get. To grasp the conventional benefits of polymeric membrane
materials such high precessability, low-cost/high-volume process-
ing, and high-surface-area packing density, the PBI membrane must
be used in a polymer/polymer composite form [327].

PU.S. DOE has simulated that the amine-based separation process
for CO2 capture will increase the cost of the electricity for a new
power plant 80(cid:1)85% while decreasing the plant efficiency by nearly
30%. However, the simulation results for 3.3 million tons of CO2 cap-
ture show that the cost of electricity using thermally stable poly-
meric membrane technology can be reduced by 14%, as represented
in Table 19 [329].

7. Conclusion

PThis study offers an exhaustive presentation and complementary
discussions on various aspects of research conducted recently on the
developments of thermally stable polymeric membranes. The princi-
ples of polymers thermal stability were outlined and recent studies
on this topic that have influenced the membrane material field were
highlighted. Several subjects such as the concept of thermal stability,
how it is measured, the limitations of these measurements, and the
key theoretical aspects of the effects of polymer structure on mem-
brane stability were discussed. Furthermore, a scheme for classifying
heat-resistant polymers on the basis of their backbone structure was
proposed to provide context for the topic. Overview of the applied
polymeric membranes for high-temperature applications based on
this scheme is presented in Fig. 33. The highest temperature that
these thermally stable membranes are tested in GS process along
with the maximum reported Tg of the polymers in each category is
presented in Table 20. As can be observed, heterocyclic and MMMs
have been utilized for the GS processes at operating temperatures as

Pinorganic materials). The critical challenge, however, is to develop
defect-free and robust MMMs by homogeneous dispersion of the
inorganic materials in the polymer matrix. MMMs have been widely
studied for various GS processes; however, comparatively little
attention has been paid to their performance at high temperatures
that calls for further exploration.

6. Technical/economic feasibility of using integrated high-
temperature membrane systems

PThe economic and technical aspects of using thermally stable
high-performance polymeric membranes are explored in this sec-
tion. For this purpose, low-cost H2 production from synthesis gas
streams was used as an example.

PIn an integrated membrane-based separation process for H2 pro-
duction, a thermally stable high-performance polymeric membrane
can be used both (i) as a membrane reactor combining the H2 purifi-
cation and the low-temperature WGS reaction units and (ii) as a H2
purification unit following a low-temperature WGS reactor replacing
the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit. Fig. 31 illustrates a typical
autothermal reforming process as well as an H2 transport membrane
(HTM)-integrated autothermal process where the membrane is uti-
lized as a membrane reactor [327].

PFreeman [327] simulated a high-temperature PBI membrane as a
membrane reactor for performing low-temperature WGS reactions
with simultaneous H2 separation. One of the key benefits of employ-
ing the membrane reactor module is to enhance H2 production in
the equilibrium-limited WGS reaction by eliminating one of the
reaction products. Membrane reactor modules can be simulated
either (i) in the passive separation mode following a conventional
reactor or (ii) in the active membrane reactor mode. From screening

P2. The amorphous polymers, which have a service temperature of
175°C (with Tg of approximately 200 °C) have been more fre-
quently utilized for making polymeric membranes. Accord-
ingly, high-temperature-resistant polymeric membranes are
primarily developed using high-performance amorphous poly-
mers.

P3. The most common and fast method of determining the relative
long-term thermal or thermooxidative stability of polymeric
membrane is TGA.

P4. Thermal

stability of a polymeric membrane can be
enhanced by the incorporation of at least one of ether,
ester, amide, carbonyl, sulfone, and phenyl groups in the
backbone of the polymer.

P5. The presence of inorganic elements in the backbone of a poly-
mer (inorganic polymeric membranes like silicon rubber and
some polyphosphazenes) increases its thermal stability. These
polymers are mainly processed by the solution casting method
which yields dense membranes applicable in GS processes.
P6. Using fluorine instead of hydrogen in the polymer matrix was
also proved to improve the thermal stability of polymeric poly-
mers. The most practiced membrane in the category of fluori-
nated polymers is the commercial Nafion, which has an
outstanding ionic conductivity due to the presence of perfluor-
ovinyl ether groups terminated with sulfonate functional
groups.

P7. The presence of carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups, with sta-
bilized resonance structure, in the polymer backbone, was
found to decrease the polymer chain mobility and conse-
quently increase thermal stability.

P8. Synthesizing double strand structures in the main polymer
chain to develop ladder polymers was found to increase the
rigidity and thermal stability of the polymer since more energy
is required for cleavage of at least two bonds.

P9. There is always a trade-off relationship between the thermal
and mechanical stability of polymers and their fusibility or sol-
ubility properties. This was mainly observed in heterocyclic
and ladder polymers. Efforts have been made to improve the
processability of these polymers by incorporating linking
groups between the aromatic/heterocyclic rings and the pen-
dant functional groups.

P10. A physical method to increase the thermal stability of a poly-
meric membrane is the incorporation of polymeric (polymer
blends) or inorganic additives (hybrid membranes) into the
target polymer. The blending of two or more high-performance
polymers (miscible or immiscible) is mainly conducted to
improve permeation properties of a membrane while main-
taining thermal stability of the final membrane. Incorporation
of well-dispersed and nano-sized inorganic materials reduces
intermolecular chain mobility, thereby increases thermal sta-
bility. In the case of weak interaction between the polymer
and inorganic material, this may sacrifice the thermal stability
as well as permeation properties of the synthesized hybrid
membranes.

applications.

Phigh as 400°C. PBI and the developed hybrid and blended mem-
branes by this polymer were found to be the most promising materi-
als in terms of thermal and mechanical stability.
It is worth
mentioning that Table 20 presents the literature data on high-tem-
perature membrane GS processes, and these membranes may poten-
tially tolerate higher temperatures. For example, the fluorinated
polymers have been routinely used for the high-temperature (100-
200°C) proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); however,
there are few studies that have examined their capability for mem-
brane GS at extreme conditions. In addition, although proof-of-con-
cept studies have demonstrated the high thermal stability of
inorganic, carbocyclic, and heterocyclic polymer materials, the syn-
thesized GS membranes have been extensively used at low tempera-
tures (25(cid:1)35°C), as presented in Tables 6, 7, and 10. Hence, further
research should be conducted to explore high-temperature-toler-
ance of these membranes for GS processes. Finally, the research on
the application of ladder polymeric membranes and polymer blend
membranes for high-temperature GS is generally sparse and calls for
further study.

PAside from in-depth discussions on the latest technical develop-
ments of thermally stable polymers, the following conclusions can
be drawn from the present study:

P1. High-temperature polymers can be categorized as amorphous
or semicrystalline, based on the difference in their molecular
structure.
