The rapid development of intelligent transportation system (ITS) offers great opportunities to improve
the overall performance of energy management strategies (EMSs) for connected hybrid electric vehicles
(HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEVs). This paper systematically surveys the state-of-the-art in EMSs for con-
nected HEVs/PHEVs. To this end, the main difference between HEVs/PHEVs and internal combustion en-
gine (ICE) vehicles is first elaborated to introduce the EMSs of connected HEVs/PHEVs. A classification
framework of EMSs for connected HEVs/PHEVs is then presented, where various approaches are classified
into three categories, i.e., in terms of single-vehicle, two-vehicle, and multi-vehicle scenarios. Eco-driving
for connected vehicles using V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) communication is emphasized as well. In the
sequel, a comprehensive literature survey is presented, and each method is elaborated in terms of its ba-
sic principles, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, future research trends from different perspectives
are suggested with a view to further development in EMSs for connected HEVs/PHEVs.

1. Introduction

Persistent environmental issues and periodic energy crises are
major  concerns  for  the  automobile  industry.  Investigating  alter-
native powertrain technologies and advanced energy-saving vehi-
cles offers potentially fuel-efficient solutions. Hybrid Electric Ve-
hicles  (HEVs)  provide  promising  fuel  efficiency  in  a  comparison
with conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, due
to their capacity to recover braking energy and the fact that an
additional degree of freedom is available to more efficiently meet
the driver-required power. Their energy management is framed as
power/torque split selection, whereby the amount of power/torque
that each of the motive sources provides is determined to satisfy
the driver demand, while improving overall vehicular energy effi-
ciency [1] . It is commonly acknowledged that improvements in fuel
economy of HEVs with reduced emissions is crucially dependent
on their energy management strategies (EMSs). Several approaches
have  been  proposed  to  tackle  the  energy  management  problem
[2–7] , noting that the performance of EMSs is closely related to
many factors, e.g., the future velocity, the road slope, driver behav-
ior, traffic information. However, the complexity and uncertainty
of driving conditions often compromise the performance of estab-
lished EMSs. How to reduce fuel consumption of HEVs and Plug-in
HEVs (PHEVs) constitutes a significant research subject for promot-
ing a paradigm shift to more sustainable mobility.

In recent years, Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) tech-
nologies have emerged to catalyze fuel savings for both conven-
tional  vehicles  and  HEVs/PHEVs.  CAV  technologies  provide  novel
ideas  for  devising  EMSs  in  optimizing  the  fuel  efficiency  and
improving  the  comprehensive  performance  of  vehicles  by  fusing
mechatronics with new informatics. With enough communication
interfaces,  vehicles  can  feature  vehicle-to-vehicle  (V2V)  commu-
nication and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication [8] . In
this way, vehicles can be connected to the intelligent transporta-
tion system(ITS), namely the vehicular network, and exchange and
share massive data of current traffic status and vehicle operating
data [9] . These data can be leveraged for developing sophisticated
EMSs that significantly improve the overall vehicular performance,
in terms of mobility, safety, and fuel economy.

HEVs and PHEVs share similarities and exhibit differences. HEVs
generally implement charge-sustaining control strategies, whereas
the  State  of  Charge  (SOC)  of  PHEVs  can  operate  in  a  relatively
wider range. The EMSs of conventional HEVs/PHEVs are usually de-

signed based on a certain driving cycle without future information
to investigate the benefits of a truly optimal algorithm, whilst con-
nected HEVs/PHEVs can take advantage of the surrounding traffic
information obtained from ITS to adapt to stochastic driving cycles.
To this end, EMSs for connected HEVs/PHEVs generally utilize a
predictive framework with further levels of connectivity. In this re-
spect, among the latest developments in the environment percep-
tion and trip planning is the so-called electronic horizon (eHori-
zon), which can be compensated by Intelligent Horizon (iHorizon)
that facilitates its immediate implementation in current ordinary
vehicles and improves their prediction capability [10] . This can be
implemented  by  combining  limited  information  readily  available
through intelligent transportation system (ITS), geographical infor-
mation system (GIS) or global positioning system (GPS). Moreover,
in the CAV context, driving style information offers room for ex-
pansion  and  further  iHorizon  development.  It  has  been  demon-
strated that the energy management controller efficiency relies on
the amount of future information with which it is provided [11,12] .
Thus, incorporating the future driving data into the EMS is an ef-
fective way to enhance the fuel economy in the future.

In the existing literature, a number of reviews on EMSs of tra-
ditional HEVs and PHEVs have been reported in [13–16] . However,
to date, there is still a lack of a comprehensive review of EMSs
for connected HEVs/PHEVs, reflecting the state of the art and elu-
cidating potential future research directions. The present work, for
the first time, adds to the literature via a comprehensive survey
regarding  the  state-of-the-art  studies  in  the  EMSs  of  connected
HEVs/PHEVs with additional classifications including single-vehicle,
double-vehicle, and multi-vehicle scenarios. We further elaborate
each approach on its principles, advantages, and disadvantages. The
importance of multi-source data from ITS in the optimization of
EMSs is emphasized. Eco-driving for connected vehicles using V2I
communication is presented as well. Finally, the future trends, as
well as research directions in the EMSs of connected HEV/PHEVs,
are discussed and suggested from different standpoints.

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  Sec-
tion  II,  the  main  difference  between  HEVs/PHEVs  and  ICE-based
vehicles  is  first  analyzed  to  introduce  the  EMSs  of  connected
HEVs/PHEVs.  The  overall  classification  for  EMSs  of  connected
HEVs/PHEVs  is  elaborated  in  Section  III.  Section  IV  introduces
single-vehicle energy management methods. In Section V, double-
vehicle  EMSs  are  illustrated.  In  Section  VI,  multi-vehicle  energy
management approaches are elaborated and analyzed, while some

important future trends are elucidated in Section VII. The key con-
clusions are given in Section VIII.

2. HEVs/PHEVs vs ICE-based vehicles

The HEVs/PHEVs yield an additional degree of freedom to opti-
mize their engine operation regions, whilst the engine speed can
only be adjusted for an ICE vehicle without enough flexibility in
regulating its torque, given a specific driver power demand. The
main characteristics of HEVs/PHEVs are listed as follows, with re-
spect to ICE-based vehicles.

• Recover the regenerative braking energy instead of dissipating

it in friction braking [17] .

• Optimize the power split among different power sources.
• Downsize the ICE while still satisfying the maximum require-

ment of the vehicle [17] .

• Reduce the idling fuel consumption by turning off the engine

when no power is needed.

• Be more complicated and expensive due to the requirement of

additional controllers.

• Be 10–30% heavier than ICE-based vehicles [18] .

Compared  with  ICE-based  vehicles,  HEVs/PHEVs  can  provide
an additional degree of freedom for regulating the engine opera-
tion points to achieve significant fuel savings. As shown in Fig. 1 ,
for conventional ICE-based vehicles, the engine speed can be ad-
justed by the transmission system, and the engine must provide
the power the driver requires. However, the engine torque can be
regulated (e.g., from A to B) for HEVs assisted by a motor to make
the engine operate in a higher efficiency area. As such, HEVs/PHEVs
should determine how to split the required power among multiple
power sources (e.g., the engine and battery) in response to differ-
ent driving conditions.

EMSs,  as  a  key  enabling  technology,  are  crucial  for  improv-
ing the overall performance of HEVs/PHEVs. However, it is more
challenging to devise EMSs due to the uncertainty of driving con-
ditions. The performance of EMSs strongly depends on vehicular
velocity evolution and power request influenced by external fac-
tors  (e.g.,  traffic  information  and  surrounding  vehicles).  In  addi-
tion, onboard sensors (e.g., radar) can provide necessary vehicu-
lar states. For connected HEVs/PHEVs, as illustrated in Fig. 2 , with

the available information from GPS, ITS (V2V/V2I), the velocity can
be optimized in an economic manner (e.g., Eco-driving), in order
to reduce fuel consumption. This can be seamlessly incorporated
into  local  powertrain  EMS  to  further  enhance  fuel  economy  for
HEVs/PHEVs. Additionally, HEVs/PHEVs may present different traf-
fic scenarios in real conditions, such as car following, a platoon of
vehicles, and therefore their EMSs should be reconstructed by shar-
ing the multi-source data.

3. Overview of energy management strategies of connected
HEVs and PHEVs

The  EMSs  for  connected  HEVs/PHEVs  are  synthesized  by  ex-
ploiting various external information (e.g. traffic, preceding vehi-
cle, velocity, and road condition), which can be classified into three
main categories according to different scenarios (see Fig. 3 ), includ-
ing single-vehicle, double-vehicle, and multi-vehicle scenarios.

The primary goal of EMS in a single-vehicle scenario is to opti-
mize the power split for a single vehicle considering traffic or road
information, which generally does not take into account the con-
straints of the movement of preceding vehicles and other perfor-
mance concerns (e.g., safety). Instead, to further improve the fuel
economy is concerned in priority considering the influence of ex-
ternal information. Currently, most of the available literature falls
under this category. The double-vehicle scenario aims to develop
an EMS for the subject vehicle to gain a tradeoff among fuel econ-
omy,  mobility,  and  safety  during  car-following  paradigms,  which
considers the interaction of two vehicles, as well as traffic informa-
tion. The objective of EMS in a multi-vehicle scenario is to investi-
gate the EMS for each vehicle by coordinating the velocity control
and power split, resulting in improvements of the overall perfor-
mance (mobility and fuel economy). The external information (e.g.
traffic and interactions among vehicles) is fully exploited in this
scenario.

4. Single-vehicle energy management strategies

As for HEVs and PHEVs, their EMSs show different character-
istics,  in  which  HEVs  aims  to  ensure  the  battery  charge  suste-
nance,  whereas  PHEVs  can  operate  in  a  charge  depleting  mode

with  a  larger  battery  pack.  As  noted  earlier,  most  of  the  exist-
ing literature focuses on the single-vehicle scenario. This section
briefly introduces the EMSs in the single-vehicle scenario and sum-
marizes their use in HEVs and PHEVs. It is well known that the
performance  of  EMS  is  strongly  dependent  on  the  driver  power
demand, which is closely related to the velocity and road grade.

Thus, EMSs would benefit from the future velocity prediction, as
well as road slope preview. For the single-vehicle scenario, the as-
sociated EMSs are devised to substantially improve fuel economy
with available external information (e.g. traffic, road condition, and
route). According to the amount of knowledge of future informa-
tion, the EMSs can be further classified into route preview based

EMSs, eco-driving based EMSs, and predictive EMSs. This type of
single-vehicle EMSs is sketched in Fig. 4 . Each EMS approach will
be described in more detail next.

4.1. Eco-driving for connected vehicles using V2I communication

As  previously  indicated,  it  is  critical  to  fuse  eco-driving  with
EMSs.  To  exhibit  the  potential  of  utilizing  V2I  information  in
the velocity optimization, eco-driving is first elaborated for con-
ventional  vehicles.  Eco-driving  in  urban  traffic  networks,  using
traffic signal information, is a significant field of cyber-physical sys-
tems  [19] .  The  adoption  of  an  energy-aware  driving  style  is  the
goal of “eco-driving”(ED) training courses [20] . In eco-driving, ve-
hicular  velocity  is  optimized  to  improve  energy  efficiency  utiliz-
ing the available information (e.g. traffic light, traffic constraints)
for different traffic scenarios, which can be implemented in differ-
ent ways. In [21] , a more detailed field test for eco-driving is con-
ducted to demonstrate the benefits of using V2I communication.
With the recent development of advanced V2V and V2I communi-
cation, there is a great opportunity for further optimizing velocity
profiles. To this end, researchers increasingly examine eco-driving
for connected vehicles and for ameliorating EMSs of HEVs/PHEVs.
Zheng et al. [22] proposed a global eco-driving optimal scheme
for bus transit, based on model predictive control (MPC), utilizing
traffic light timing through V2I communication, in order to min-
imize vehicular emissions. Ubiergo et al. [23] developed an eco-
driving strategy for connected vehicles to evaluate the mobility and
fuel economy at signalized intersections using the traffic signal and
loop detector data via V2I communication, which is robust to the
disturbances in traffic conditions (see Fig. 5 ).

munication.  The  primary  goal  of  velocity  advisory  system  is  to
avoid the red lights since idling may require additional fuel (see
Fig. 6 ). The advisory system demonstrated to achieve an average
9.5% improvement in fuel economy.

Ko  et  al.  [25]  developed  an  eco-driving  advisory  system  to
maintain the safety and reduce fuel consumption, considering the
leading  vehicle  and  traffic  signal  state  obtained  from  V2I  com-
munication  for  stop-and-go  traffic.  Lin  et  al.  [26]  introduced  an
eco-driving optimal algorithm at multiple intersections with traf-
fic signals and speed limits via V2I communication to increase fuel
savings (see Fig. 7 ).

Zhang  et  al.  [19]  introduced  an  eco-driving  optimization  ap-
proach  using  the  traffic  signals  through  V2I  communication  for
public transit, with the purpose of avoiding extra stops at signal-
ized  intersections  and  reducing  vehicular  emissions.  To  enhance
energy savings, Li et al. [27] investigated an eco-departure strat-
egy  for  connected  vehicles  with  automatic  mechanical  transmis-
sion (AMT), which optimizes the engine and transmission together.
To obtain online applicability, Nunzio et al. [28] developed an eco-
driving system to minimize energy consumption at multiple sig-
nalized intersections using the traffic light timing obtained from
V2I communication. Taking into account the dynamic behavior of
the preceding vehicle, Kamal et al. [29] presented an eco-driving
control system by utilizing the traffic signal timing via V2I com-
munication and the preceding vehicle’s velocity predicted, which
can  avoid  red  lights  and  thus  improve  fuel  economy.  Jin  et  al.
[30] developed a power-based optimal longitudinal controller for
a connected eco-driving system utilizing external information (e.g.
upcoming  traffic  signal  information,  preceding  vehicle  and  road
grade).

Mahler et al. [24] . investigated eco-driving for connected vehi-
cles with the traffic signal state and timing through cellular com-

Eco-driving  generally  provides  the  recommended  optimal  ve-
locity  profile.  However,  some  drivers  may  not  follow  the

recommended velocity if it does not take into account their pref-
erences, which in turn incurs some negative aspects. Accordingly,
Lu et al. [31] integrated a driver model into eco-driving to plan
the optimal velocity with the traffic light information through V2I
communication, which can achieve additional fuel savings. Further,
Butakov et al. [32] proposed a driving pace optimization approach
considering the driver’s preferences and characteristics in an per-
sonalized way, utilizing traffic lights timing and location through
V2I communication. This can assist the driver in following the rec-
ommended optimal velocity, which in turn allows a potential im-
provement of up 60% in fuel efficiency, compared to natural driving
paces.

To  summarize,  eco-driving  is  a  relatively  low-cost  and  im-
mediate  measure  to  considerably  reduce  fuel  consumption  and
emissions  [33] .  Advanced  eco-driving  systems  that  will  become
available with V2I communication can further promote energy ef-
ficiency  increase  and  tailpipe  emissions  reduction.  Nevertheless,
such systems must be thoroughly applied by the driver, and the
performance varies with different drivers. Many factors (e.g. driv-
ing style, time of day) should be further considered to assess the
benefit  of  such  a  solution.  Additionally,  eco-driving  becomes  in-
creasingly  attractive  in  the  context  of  connected  and  automated
mobility,  since  real-time  traffic  information  would  be  available
with the help of V2I communication.

4.2. Energy management strategies of HEVs

The  performance  of  EMSs  relies  on  the  prediction  of  vehicu-
lar states (e.g., future velocity). Vehicle speeds are transient, ran-

dom, and dependent on many factors such as traffic, roadway type,
weather, driver style [34] . It is essential to incorporate the future
driving information into EMSs to improve fuel economy. Addition-
ally, in [35] , it is suggested that sensor and signaling technologies
are  essential  for  improvements  in  fuel  economy  due  to  the  dy-
namic nature of driving and roadway conditions. Thus, integrating
specific vehicle signals with eco-driving and optimal EMSs of HEVs
should receive growing attention in the future. Furthermore, uti-
lizing predictive information to devise EMS is helpful to enhance
fuel economy and enable a real-time implementation. According to
the information requirements, we can sort these into three main
categories.

4.2.1. Route preview based EMSs

Route preview driven EMSs aim to utilize the static data (e.g.
road  grade,  speed  limits)  for  a  longer  horizon  in  devising  the
energy  management  for  a  target  trip  to  maximize  the  energy
efficiency of HEV. Knowledge of upcoming terrain and traffic con-
ditions  facilitates  more  judicious  use  of  the  electric  power  by
extending  the  planning  horizon  [36] .  With  preview  information,
power-split can be optimized in an efficient manner since the road
grade has an impact on the power demand. Moreover, it has been
reported in [37] that utilizing the upcoming trip information leads
to a better power distribution between the engine and the motor.
Zheng et al. [38] optimized the power split and velocity profile
simultaneously to obtain further fuel economy improvements with
traffic preview information (e.g., minimum and maximum veloci-
ties). This approach provides an advisory optimal driving route that
is especially applicable for autonomous HEVs. To improve energy

efficiency for HEVs, Seok et al. [39] presented a velocity profile op-
timization approach that allows for efficient velocity tracking by
exploiting the road grade preview information and velocity enve-
lope over a short horizon, achieving potential energy savings. The
required  cumulative  wheel  power  is  minimized,  resulting  in  de-
coupling of velocity trajectory optimization from powertrain con-
trol. The road grade plays a great role in battery discharging and
charging. To this end, Zeng et al. [40] proposed an energy man-
agement using a stochastic model predictive controller for a paral-
lel HEV considering the road grade preview. The proposed method
can maintain the battery SOC in a certain constrained range while
improving  fuel  efficiency.  Opila  et  al.  [41]  formulated  a  stochas-
tic optimal control problem by incorporating traffic and uncertain
route  information  and  devised  an  energy  management  approach
for  multiple  routes  considering  different  levels  of  future  knowl-
edge. Zhang et.al [42] integrated terrain preview into the energy
management  problem  to  investigate  the  benefits  of  utilizing  fu-
ture information(e.g., future road slope) for parallel HEVs. To in-
vestigate the potential of utilizing road grade preview in EMSs, He
et al. [43] established a predictive energy management controller
for  HEVs  by  forecasting the  road  grade.  The autoregressive inte-
grated moving average approach is utilized to predict near future
road slope, and MPC is employed to determine the power split. In
a  word,  this  type  of  EMSs  investigates  the  influence  of  preview
static information on optimizing EMSs for a longer horizon. It is
easy to implement and obtain better fuel economy, compared to
those without preview information.

tory over a long prediction horizon by preview information (e.g.
speed  limits,  road  slope,  road  curvature)  from  a  navigation  sys-
tem, and the inner layer performs a combined velocity and SOC
trajectory optimization over a short horizon to track the desired
velocity. This approach can achieve noticeable fuel savings by op-
timizing the velocity and battery SOC. Hu et al. [51] constructed
a two-level integrated optimal controller for velocity and power-
train for HEV under the rolling terrain scenario (see Fig. 8 ). In the
vehicle level, the acceleration trajectory is optimized utilizing the
speed limit information and future road altitude. In the powertrain
level, the power-split is determined with the future road slope and
optimal acceleration. The results show that the proposed frame-
work  can  better  maximize  the  fuel  efficiency  by  optimizing  the
power-split and vehicle acceleration together. Currently, the ther-
mal load (e.g., A/C) is not included in energy management in most
existing studies. To evaluate the benefits of fully leveraging traffic
information, Amini et al. [52] sequentially optimized the velocity,
air  conditioning  thermal  management,  and  power  split  with  the
predictive traffic  information for  connected  HEVs,  to  further  im-
prove fuel economy. The resultant energy savings can be achieved
up to 18.8%.

To sum up, an eco-driving based EMS is to globally plan the
driving cycle to obtain an optimal velocity and integrate it into the
EMS  controller  to  minimize  energy  consumption.  By  introducing
eco-driving  into  EMSs,  higher  vehicle-level  energy  efficiency  can
be accomplished. Generally, it can be implemented by a two-level
framework, including the vehicle level and the powertrain level.

4.2.2. Eco-driving based EMSs

4.2.3. Predictive EMSs

Generally, the main idea of eco-driving is to find the optimal
way  of  driving  a  specific  journey  from  an  energy  point  of  view
[44] . In this method, eco-driving is normally devised to reduce en-
ergy consumption by optimizing velocity trajectories, which can be
integrated into EMSs to further enhance fuel economy. The power
split is further optimized by tracking the optimal velocity provided
via the eco-driving system. It is difficult to optimize the whole ve-
locity trajectory, because it is a very complex problem, due to mul-
tiple factors affecting the driving trajectory [44] . Typically, for ap-
plications in HEVs, traffic information (e.g. traffic signal phase and
timing), as well as road conditions (e.g., speed limits), is consid-
ered to optimize EMSs.

To tackle the issue of different time scales in velocity control
and powertrain optimization, Guo et al. [45] developed a bi-level
MPC for HEVs to integrate velocity optimization and energy man-
agement. In the higher level, the velocity is optimized with MPC
for eco-driving by utilizing the traffic light time schedule. At the
lower level, Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP) based MPC is
employed  to  determine  the  power  split  and  gear  shift  schedule.
The energy and computational efficiencies are both improved. An
eco-driving system is investigated to improve energy savings of an
electric vehicle in [46] , via assimilating the traffic signal through
V2I  communication.  Yu  et  al.  [47]  investigated  eco-driving  with
EMSs of HEVs, considering road grade information and traffic light
information from ITS(V2I). An MPC scheme is used to predict the
traffic state and calculate an optimal control strategy over a cer-
tain prediction horizon. The goal is to improve the fuel economy
while avoiding frequent stops at the red phase of stop lights. Bou-
vier  et  al.  [48]  computed  eco-driving  cycles  with  vehicle  speed
limits using dynamic programming (DP) for HEVs and then con-
ducted energy management to reduce fuel consumption. Maamria
et al. [49] assessed eco-driving cycle calculation methods by ful-
filling the speed limitation and then examined fuel savings of en-
ergy management in parallel HEVs, aiming to optimize the torque
split and gear ratio. To evaluate the benefits of eco-driving in EMSs,
Heppeler et al. [50] proposed a two-layer control framework for
parallel  HEVs.  The  outer  layer  is  to  plan  an  optimal  SOC  trajec-

Different  from  eco-driving  based  EMSs,  predictive  EMSs  can
fully  take  advantage  of  the  capability  to  forecast  the  future  un-
certainty  of  driving  cycle  in  various  ways  (e.g.  deterministic  or
stochastic), leading to enough robustness with respect to stochas-
tic driving cycles. This can be achieved by estimating the future
velocity over the prediction horizon, in combination with an op-
timal EMS via the available information (e.g. traffic, preceding ve-
hicles) from ITS. The goal is to maximize fuel efficiency and adapt
to changing driving conditions. Moreover, this approach normally
relies on the accuracy of the predicted velocity or power demand.
To  implement  the  predictive  energy  management  with  im-
proved  fuel  economy,  Baker  et  al.  [53]  predicted  the  velocity
through  V2V  communication  by  incorporating  real-world  driving
data and analyzed the impact of prediction error on fuel economy
of HEVs. The velocity of the following vehicle is forecasted further
ahead than the 5 s of information obtained from the leading vehi-
cle and is provided for the predictive powertrain controller. Zhang
et al. [54] exploited a chaining neural network (CNN) to predict
the velocity of the subject vehicle considering the preceding ve-
hicle velocity, as well as traffic information through V2V and V2I
communication, and applied it into equivalent consumption min-
imization strategy (ECMS) accordingly to realize the power split,
resulting in improvements of fuel economy for connected vehicles.
Bouwman et al. [55] investigated a predictive energy management
controller  for  HEVs  in  the  city  condition,  considering  real-time
traffic information and traffic light locations to enhance fuel econ-
omy  (see  Fig.  9 ).  The  prediction  of  velocity  profile  is  performed
by  varying  traffic  light  crossing  speeds,  while  the  SOC  reference
is  estimated  by  a  Monte  Carlo  approach  over  each  prediction
horizon.

The obvious advantage of this strategy is that dynamic predic-
tion  is  performed  with  the  available  data  to  capture  the  nature
of changing traffic during real-time operations. This allows a real-
time optimization of the power split and yields better adaptability.
Therefore,  the  predictive  energy  management  algorithm  respects
real-time  implementation  requirements  [56] .  On  the  other  hand,
the prediction accuracy is affected by intricate factors, such as the

prediction horizon and foreknowledge of driving-related data, both
of  which  contribute  to  fuel  economy  and  remain  challenging  to
assess.

To summarize, these approaches aim to enhance fuel economy
for HEVs by taking into account external environmental informa-
tion  from  ITS  and  GPS,  such  as  the  preceding  vehicle  velocity,
traffic information, and road grade (terrain preview). With such in-
formation, HEVs can gain potential fuel savings by maintaining the
SOC charge sustenance during an entire trip. Exploiting the traf-
fic information, full trip, and terrain preview is beneficial to op-
timizing  the  velocity  and  further  improving  the  performance  of
EMSs.

4.3. Energy management strategies of PHEVs

Energy  management  strategies  for  PHEVs  are  crucial  for  ve-
hicular performance, similar to those employed in HEVs, with an
additional degree of freedom corresponding to the ability to de-
plete  the  battery  to  obtain  electric  tractive  power,  coupled  with
the possibility of recharging the battery pack [57] . In this respect,
the battery can be charged by external sources (e.g. solar power,
power grid). Hence, the EMS of a PHEV is often more complicated,
than that of an HEV due to the charge depleting characteristic of
PHEVs. This involves how to conduct the SOC programming effec-
tively during the vehicle operation and how to interact with smart

grids when plugged in. The primary goal is to develop an optimal
SOC trajectory considering fuel economy and battery health with
respect to various driving conditions, while the charging electricity
generation should match the demand power. In addition, in [58] ,
it is demonstrated that intelligent controllers (connected with ITS
information)  could  monitor  and  control  the  electrical  grid  when
connected and recharge the PHEV battery, enhancing the flexibility
of PHEVs.

It has been reported that prior knowledge of the upcoming trip
information, such as speed, road grade, position, distance, position
of stop sign, can significantly increase fuel efficiency of PHEVs [59] .
In [60] , various impact factors (e.g. road grade, cargo, weather) are
analyzed for the performance of EMS for PHEVs. It is also shown
that integrating the impact factor analysis in the energy manage-
ment can lead to improvements in fuel economy. Therefore, to fa-
cilitate the capability of EMSs for PHEVs, several approaches incor-
porating future driving information are proposed to program the
SOC trajectory and optimize the power split. In this section, three
control strategies are elaborated in more detail, e.g., route preview
based EMSs, eco-driving based EMSs, and predictive EMSs.

4.3.1. Route preview based EMSs

Some studies have indicated how to integrate trip information
into EMSs with respect to known routes [61] . This method mainly
preplans  the  optimal  SOC  trajectory  utilizing  the  available  fore-
knowledge for a target trip. By exploring more static information
(e.g.  travel  distance,  road  grade,  speed  limits),  EMSs  can  exhibit
more flexibility in real-time operations.

For vehicles operating in a commuter route (e.g., a hybrid elec-
tric bus), EMSs can be implemented in a look-up table form; for in-
stance, Larsson et al. [62] introduced a commuter route based EMS
for a parallel PHEV that aims to identify the route from historical
driving database and determine the optimal solution in advance.
The corresponding optimal solution is selected when the current
driving is recognized to match the database from GPS driving data.
To exploit the potential of trip preview in EMSs, Sanaz [63] sys-
tematically investigated trip-assisted energy management for con-
nected PHEVs with the available information from ITS, GPS, radar
system, and GIS (see Fig. 10 ). This work intends to generate the
optimal SOC trajectory based on the future driving prediction (fu-
ture speed, road slope) and thus achieves the power allocation in
an optimum fashion.

It  is  beneficial  to  planning  the  SOC  for  PHEVs  with  trip  pre-
view information. To this end, Vajedi et al. [64] designed a route-
based energy management based on A-ECMS that makes full use
of  trip  preview  information  for  PHEVs  to  substantially  enhance
their fuel efficiency. The optimal SOC profile is generated by uti-
lizing the future trip information and employed into EMS to allo-
cate the power in a real-time manner. Taghavipour et.al [65] com-
pared various route-based EMSs for PHEVs using different levels of
trip information (e.g., distance, speed) from ITS and GPS. MPC and
adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS)
are employed to split the power, respectively, followed by an op-
timal SOC planning based on known trip information. This work
proves  the  benefit  of  trip  information  in  improving  the  control
performance  and  enables  a  real-time  implementation  capability.

244

F. Zhang, X. Hu and R. Langari et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 73 (2019) 235–256

Tian et al. [66] proposed a data-driven hierarchical energy man-
agement involving an optimal SOC planning and powertrain con-
trol for PHEVs. To generate the SOC reference, the target SOC tra-
jectory is planned by training the historical driving cycle data and
connectivity-enabled partial trip information (e.g. low-speed ratio,
high-speed ratio) from ITS. The powertrain control is implemented
in real-time to track the SOC reference. To obtain a tradeoff be-
tween battery lifetime and fuel economy on uphill terrain, Liu et al.
[67] presented a target SOC planning approach for PHEVs with the
driving cycle predicted by traffic information (e.g. average veloc-
ity) from GPS/GIS on an uphill road. He et al. [68] introduced a
global driving cycle reconstruction method based on real-time traf-
fic information (e.g., the velocity of current road section) from ITS,
which can be utilized in a global optimization of energy manage-
ment  for  PHEVs  to  enhance  the  robustness  to  stochastic  driving
cycles. This enables the feasibility of real-time implementation for
constructing  a  global  driving  cycle  and  planning  the  SOC  trajec-
tory. Du et al. [69] developed a segment-based stochastic EMS for
a plug-in hybrid electric bus by dividing the driving cycle into sec-
tions, depending on the location of bus stops. Yang et al. [70] pro-
posed a cloud computing based energy management for a PHEV
with the traffic flow data. In the offline part, massive traffic flow
data collected from wireless technologies are processed and used
to cluster the typical driving conditions. In the online part, the cur-
rent  driving  condition  is  identified  by  a  support  vector  machine
and  applied  in  EMS.  Zhang  et  al.  [71]  utilized  a  BP  (Back  Prop-
agation) neural network to identify the driver behavior with the
accumulated  accelerator  pedal  and  vehicle  velocity.  This  can  be
combined  with  real-time  traffic  information  (e.g.  vehicle  geo-
graphic coordinates, vehicle instantaneous velocity) from GPS and
ITS to adjust the equivalent factor of an adaptive ECMS for a paral-
lel PHEV. To implement on-line SOC programming, Mozaffari et al.
[72] utilized computational intelligence techniques to generate the
optimal SOC in real-time considering the future route information
for PHEVs. Additionally, Valera et al. [73] predicted the vehicle ve-
locity for the next time horizon based on an ANN (Artificial Neu-
ral Network) through utilizing the current and previous data and
modeling the driver behavior. This can provide an efficient driving
cycle for EMSs of PHEVs. To seek the influence of road grade on the
EMS, Zhang et al. [74] exploited the future trip terrain to estimate
the equivalence factor of ECMS for a PHEV during a hilly terrain
scenario. This is favorable to energy management with future driv-
ing information. With this method, the parameter of ECMS can be
adjusted according to the preview terrain, estimated velocity, and
the distance to the next charging station.

To summarize, the objective of route preview based EMSs is to
plan the SOC trajectory for a longer horizon with preview infor-
mation, which can be partial information (like the distance) or full
knowledge of the driving cycle (e.g., future velocity, terrain profile).
It is relatively easy to globally plan the SOC trajectory and deter-
mine the control parameters. However, it is of less adaptability to
the variation of driving profiles, since no dynamic traffic is consid-
ered.

4.3.2. Eco-driving based EMSs

Eco-driving is regarded as an optimal control problem to min-
imize energy consumption for a given trip [20] . Road constraints
(e.g.  traffic  light,  speed  limit,  leading  vehicle)  should  be  consid-
ered  when  devising  an  eco-driving  controller.  Eco-driving  based
EMSs integrate velocity optimization and energy management that
fully exploit the traffic information, which can further improve fuel
economy of connected PHEVs.

A two-stage optimization method is proposed in [75] to opti-
mize  the  velocity  and  powertrain  states  of  an  eco-driving  PHEV
with the V2V and V2I information(e.g., surrounding vehicles and
traffic light status). To fully investigate the benefits of connected

vehicle technologies, Barik et al. [76] explored a velocity optimiza-
tion algorithm by utilizing the velocity bounds via V2V and V2I
communication for optimizing the power split of connected PHEVs.
With short-term prediction, fuel economy can be optimized over
a  given  prediction  horizon.  To  evaluate  the  benefits  of  utilizing
predicted traffic information in the energy management, He et al.
[77] investigated ITS-enabled power management for PHEVs to ob-
tain improved fuel economy by optimizing the driving cycle that
can be transmitted through communication. The penetration rate
of  ITS-enabled  PHEVs  is  analyzed  as  well.  To  integrate  the  real-
time traffic information into the energy management, Jiang et al.
[78] proposed a hierarchical power management scheme based on
a cyber-physical-system (CPS) approach for PHEVs with the avail-
able traffic data from the vehicular network (see Fig. 11 ). At the
higher level, the SOC optimal trajectory is generated with traffic
prediction,  while  the  control  policy  for  the  powertrain  is  deter-
mined to achieve fuel savings at the lower level. Taghavipour et al.
[79] suggested that the trip information from ITS should be consid-
ered in the EMS of PHEVs based on MPC, in order to improve fuel
economy. This strategy aims to utilize different levels of trip in-
formation in devising the optimal SOC trajectory for the EMS. The
results validated that fuel economy with full trip information can
be improved, compared to a common charge-depleting and charge-
sustainability (CD-CS) strategy.

In addition, Tajeddin et al. [80] developed an ecological cruise
controller using a generalized minimal residual method (GMRES)
based nonlinear MPC to reduce the computational time and fuel
consumption for a PHEV during hilly terrains. Qi et al. [81] pro-
posed an integrated connected eco-driving system to optimize the
powertrain  and  velocity  for  a  PHEV  simultaneously  for  different
traffic  scenarios.  The  optimal  velocity  trajectory  is  planned  with
the  signal  timing  and  phase  through  V2I  communication  to  ob-
tain  smoothed  acceleration,  which  is  then  utilized  to  distribute
the power for the hybrid powertrain control over each prediction
horizon. Bhavsar et al. [82] investigated potential fuel savings for
PHEVs with different types of information provided by connected
vehicle technologies. The results confirm that energy savings can
reach up to 35%, with a 30% penetration of connected PHEVs at
the peak hour volume.

In  this  type  of  EMS,  the  optimal  SOC  trajectory  is  globally
planned with the available traffic information, and fuel economy is
further improved by optimizing the velocity and power split at dif-
ferent levels. However, the performance is dependent on the driver
behavior, since the optimal velocity is tracked by the driver in real
conditions. Moreover, the driver behavior is not considered in most
eco-driving  EMSs  that  appeared  in  the  literature.  Thus,  it  is  es-
sential to incorporate a driver model into an eco-driving EMS to
enhance energy efficiency for different scenarios. In addition, this
category of EMS emphasizes the global velocity optimization and
achieves energy savings without mobility loss.

4.3.3. Predictive EMSs

Predictive EMSs mainly optimize the power split utilizing the
predictive information with respect to uncertainty and disturbance
of  a  driving  cycle.  This  strategy  requires future  driving cycle  in-
formation  (e.g.  future  velocity)  that  can  be  forecasted  with  the
available  information  (e.g.  traffic  condition,  road  condition)  from
ITS. It is impossible to perform an exact prediction for an entire
trip. Instead, the prediction should be carried out partially where
only a small portion of the upcoming trip is foreseen [83] . More-
over, the prediction accuracy is influenced by many factors, such as
driver  behavior, road  condition,  preceding vehicles, and  dynamic
traffic  conditions.  Inaccurate  prediction  may  deteriorate  the  per-
formance  of  an  EMS.  Thus,  to  improve  the  prediction  accuracy,
more surrounding information should be considered in an efficient
way. To this end, researchers increasingly utilize predictive EMSs

to improve fuel savings. In this subsection, we mainly focus on the
short-term prediction.

The  future  velocity  is  not  only  related  to  the  traffic  infor-
mation,  but  also  depends  on  the  weather  and  other  aspects.
Therefore, Pinak et al. [84] analyzed the effect of various factors
(traffic, weather, etc. ) on the future velocity profile and sought its
impacts on  the performance of  ITS enabled energy management
for PHEVs. To identify the significance of ITS for ECMS, the corre-
lation between the equivalence factor (EF) of ECMS and velocity
statistics is determined to find the optimal EF. It is also suggested
that  the  prior  information,  such  as  velocity  profiles,  road  grade,
trip distance, weather characteristics, and other exogenous factors,
is helpful to enhance the performance of such an EMS.

The prediction accuracy can be further improved with the ad-
vanced ITS. To fully utilize the benefits of V2I communication in
HEVs/PHEVS, He et al. [85] investigated the prediction of the ve-
locity and energy management to achieve the benefits of energy
savings. The penetration rate in the network level is analyzed to
reveal the advantage of V2I communication for improving fuel effi-
ciency of HEVs/PHEVs. The SOC reference curve plays a crucial role
in the energy management of PHEVs. In reality, the SOC reference
trajectory is varying with different driving conditions, however, the
SOC may deviate from the optimal one without considering real-
time planning. To this end, Tian et al. [86] explored an SOC plan-
ning method taking into account the trip information from ITS for
a  plug-in  hybrid  electric  city  bus  and  tracked  the  SOC  curve  by
an adaptive fuzzy logic controller. This method can provide a rea-
sonable SOC curve accounting for the operating conditions of the
powertrain.

Additionally,  individual  trips  are  commonly  utilized  for  the
evaluation of energy management without considering recharging
opportunities during a trip. To address this issue, Wu et al. [87] de-
veloped an intelligent energy management for a PHEV taking ad-
vantage of real-time traffic and road grade information from ITS.
The velocity trajectory is generated by exploiting the vehicle loca-
tion, real-time traffic, and roadway characteristic, which is utilized
in determining the SOC trajectory. This strategy assumes that the
battery  recharging  opportunity  is  available  at  intermediate  stops
along the tour to generate a global SOC curve. Currently, most lit-

erature  mainly  focuses  on  the  SOC  planning  approach  based  on
preplanned driving route without considering the dynamic traffic
data. To bridge this gap, Sun et al. [88] proposed a traffic data en-
abled  predictive  energy  management  for  PHEVs  and  constructed
the SOC trajectory by merging dynamic real-time traffic data. The
global SOC planning method is proposed with the dynamic traf-
fic  data  (see  Fig.  12 ),  and  an  MPC  power-flow  regulator  is  used
to distribute the power for real-time implementation. To achieve
this  goal,  a  power  balance  HEV  model  is  also  developed  to  im-
prove  the  computational  efficiency  for  such  a  SOC  planning.  Xie
et al. [89] also developed a computationally efficient energy man-
agement based on MPC for a PHEV with an adaptive SOC planning
method. The velocity is predicted using a Markov chain, and the
corresponding SOC trajectory can be updated over each prediction
horizon.

Yu et al. [90] presented a trip-oriented energy management for
PHEVs by exploiting recognized driving pattern along a trip to pre-
plan the SOC trajectory with the trip preview information (such

as speed limit, altitude) for real-world driving trips (see Fig. 13 ).
This approach incorporates a driving pattern-based SOC planning
method  into  the  energy  management  to  optimize  vehicular  fuel
economy, which is robust to the variations of driving trips.

Feng et al. [91] explored energy demand prediction based en-
ergy management for PHEVs with a neural network predicting the
energy demand by statistical parameter (e.g. average velocity, max-
imum  velocity).  A  SOC  planning  model  is  developed  to  provide
the  reference  for  tracking  by  the  A-ECMS  method.  This  strategy
can optimally split the power between the engine and motor from
a global perspective while achieving similar results compared to
DP (Dynamic Programming). A trip condition prediction model is
proposed  with  a  neural  network  in  [92]  to  obtain  the  real-time
velocity in evaluating the performance of predictive energy man-
agement for PHEVs. By applying a genetic algorithm and particle
swarm optimization algorithm, the prediction accuracy can be im-
proved.

The main advantage of this type of EMS is that the optimal SOC
trajectory can be actively planned with the predicted velocity and
updated in a real-time manner. This promotes the potential appli-
cation in real-time conditions. Moreover, the overall efficiency can
be  potentially  improved  with  predictive  control  followed  by  im-
proving the adaptability to the disturbance and uncertainty in traf-
fic conditions. However, some issues needed to be resolved, such
as, how to select a proper prediction horizon and increase the pre-

diction  accuracy.  In  general,  it  is  difficult  to  predict  the  velocity
precisely. Thus, more external information should be included to
further improve the prediction accuracy. On the other hand, the
solution of optimization algorithms (e.g. MPC) in predictive EMSs
should be further investigated to reduce the computational burden.
In this  section,  EMSs  for  the single-vehicle scenario is  elabo-
rated for HEVs and PHEVs. It is noticed that the performance of
EMSs is strongly dependent on the amount of future information.
With  the  available  information  from  ITS,  the  velocity  prediction
can be performed well. For a convenient and straightforward com-
parison, we summarize the foregoing EMSs in terms of their ad-
vantages and disadvantages in Table 1 .

5. Double-vehicle energy management strategies

It  is  suggested  in  Hu  et  al.  [93]  that  the  underlying  energy-
saving mechanisms in  car  following are  intimately  coupled  with
the information accessed by V2V/V2I connectivity. In the double-
vehicle  scenario  (see  Fig.  14 ),  EMSs  are  developed  by  adopting
economical adaptive cruise control (eco-ACC) during car-following
scenarios  to  combine  fuel  economy  and  safety  considering  the
interaction  of  two  vehicles.  Such  strategies  aim  to  further  im-
prove fuel economy of the subject vehicle considering the behavior
of the preceding vehicle while satisfying the safety requirement.
Various economical ACCs  are commonly  integrated into EMSs  to

investigate  the  potential  of  the  interaction  mechanisms  on  the
safety  and  fuel  economy  of  HEVs/PHEVs.  Moreover,  economical
driving has attracted more attention due to its capability to pro-
vide an optimal velocity for the driver to achieve fuel savings.

An ACC adaptively adjusts the vehicle velocity depending on the
preceding vehicle behavior by modulating the throttle or applying
brake [94] . Economical ACC, a smarter ACC, normally optimizes the
velocity based on the surrounding vehicles’ states and traffic infor-
mation ahead of the vehicle. For a traditional ACC, only the safety
index is considered instead of working with an EMS to improve
fuel economy. To this end, increasing researchers have focused on
the integration of both ACC and EMS or optimized them simulta-
neously. During car-following scenarios, the preceding vehicle ve-
locity that is involved in devising the EMS has a great impact on
the following vehicle. Furthermore, due to the complicated traffic
conditions, it is crucial to incorporate the future driving condition
for optimizing both EMS and ACC. Thus, the concept of predictive
cruise controllers (PCC) for HEVs is proposed in [95] to optimize
the velocity trajectory and power split considering the traffic dis-
turbances. In addition, in [96] , as an intelligent ACC, a PCC is pro-
posed based on a stochastic MPC by predicting the preceding vehi-
cle’s velocity utilizing the traffic information through V2V and V2I
communication.  This  enables  the  possibility  of  incorporating  the
future velocity to better devise the ACC. Similarly, a PCC is pro-
posed to ensure the safety and reduce vehicular fuel consumption
in [97] during a car-following scenario by forecasting the preced-
ing vehicle velocity. This allows the real-time implementation due
to  a  lower  computational  burden.  A  novel  PCC  is  also  proposed
to enhance fuel efficiency utilizing real-time high-definition maps
with an MPC in [98] , which can achieve an 8% improvement in fuel
economy, relative to a standard ACC.

All  these  controllers  (Eco-ACC  and  PCC)  can  be  integrated
into  EMSs  to  enhance  the  overall  safety  and  fuel  economy  per-
formance. Therefore, two control strategies, i.e., ACC-based EMSs
and PCC-based EMSs, are subsequently elaborated in car-following
scenarios.

5.1. ACC-based EMSs

ACC offers traffic situation and enables flexible automation to
HEVs/PHEVs,  which  potentially  increases  fuel  efficiency  [99] .The
primary goal of an ACC-based EMS is to optimize the power split
by combining fuel economy with safety, assuming that the preced-
ing vehicle velocity is predefined or known in advance. The perfor-
mance can be improved individually or simultaneously. Specifically,
for the former, the target optimal velocity can be determined by an
eco-ACC and then the power split is calculated to track the veloc-

ity. This may not be optimal but offers a solution for combined
ACC and EMS. For the latter, the EMS is devised based on a uni-
fied cost function involving fuel economy and safety to realize the
velocity tracking of the eco-ACC. Traffic information and preceding
vehicle’s velocity from ITS are considered for both cases.

To exploit ACC in the energy management of HEVs, Luo et al.
[100] proposed a novel ACC based on a nonlinear MPC for intelli-
gent HEVs to follow the preceding vehicle considering traffic safety,
fuel economy, and ride comfort simultaneously. This ACC can en-
hance fuel efficiency and tracking safety compared to a traditional
ACC. However, the preceding vehicle velocity is predefined instead
of being predicted in practice. Traditional research studies on ACC
mainly focus on the driving safety instead of fuel economy. To ad-
dress this downside, Vajedi et al. [101] integrated an economical
ACC into the energy management for PHEVs to simultaneously im-
prove fuel economy and safety during vehicle following scenarios
(see Fig. 15 ). A nonlinear MPC is employed to optimally adjust the
velocity of the subject vehicle to improve the driving safety, while
minimizing energy cost. This strategy assumes that the accelera-
tion of the leading vehicle is exponential varying over each moving
horizon.

The combination of ACC and EMS is generally implemented by
providing  the  preceding  vehicles’  velocity  in  advance.  Luo  et  al.
[102]  developed  a  hierarchical  multi-objective  decoupling  algo-
rithm for an intelligent HEV to coordinate fuel economy, ride com-
fort  and  safety,  so  as  to  ultimately  improve  the  overall  perfor-
mance. This strategy integrates an active distance control with the
energy management, given the preceding vehicle velocity, which
can make the acceleration smoother. Akhegaonkar et al. [103] in-
vestigated a smart and green ACC applied to the EMS for an HEV
to fulfill a co-examination of the safety and energy efficiency. The
proposed ACC, as a supervisory controller, adjusts the velocity of
an eco-vehicle, with ECMS being the powertrain controller to op-
timize  the  power-split  to  increase  fuel  economy.  However,  only
certain  specific  scenarios-based  fuel  savings  are  checked  for  the
Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). Ab-
drakhmanov et al. [104] exploited a DP based speed and energy
co-optimization  algorithm  to  simultaneously  optimize  the  speed
profile and power-split in improving fuel economy of HEVs. It con-
siders the tracking capability of ACC for the energy management.
Moreover, the preceding vehicle velocity is defined by some rules.
To fully utilize the benefits of recuperative energy for EMSs, Ku-
ral  et  al.  [105]  integrated  an  ACC  approach  into  the  EMS  for  a
parallel  HEV  by  taking  advantage  of  the  predictive  information.
An  MPC  based  ACC  considering  the  linear  inter-vehicle  dynam-
ics is devised to predict the future velocity and acceleration that
can be used to distribute the power split with a predictive ECMS.

The  goal  is  to  implement  predictive  charge  control  for  the  bat-
tery.  To preserve reasonable robustness against disturbances and
uncertainty, Sakhdari et al. [106] developed a robust Eco-ACC for
PHEVs  with  an  adaptive  tube-based  MPC  to  improve  the  overall
performance.

The velocity of preceding vehicle can be predefined by some
rules according to the traffic light time. To this end, Alrifaee et al.
[107] exploited a PCC into the EMS of a Range Extended Electric
Vehicle utilizing the upcoming traffic light to further enhance fuel
economy. The optimal velocity reference can be calculated to re-
duce idling time by a set of logical rules with the upcoming traffic
light,  and  then  an  MPC  is  utilized  to  track  this  optimal velocity
while  determining  the  optimal  power  split.  Furthermore,  to  im-
prove fuel economy of HEVs, Li et al. [108] devised an ecological
ACC (Eco ACC) by merging the ACC with an EMS for a parallel HEV
during car-following scenarios. This approach can adaptively adjust
the inter-vehicle distance and thus ensure driving safety while re-
ducing fuel consumption. The main characteristic of this approach
is that the online gearshift, as well as power split, is determined
without prior knowledge of the future driving condition. Tajeddin
et al. [109] developed a computationally efficient Eco-ACC for car-
following scenarios with a GMRES-based nonlinear MPC for PHEVs,
which aims to  optimize energy consumption while ensuring the
comfort and safety utilizing the future trip information and radar
data. The preceding vehicle velocity is selected as standard driv-
ing cycles (e.g. UDDS, HWFET). Instead of a simple combination of
ACC and EMS, to obtain a better tradeoff between ACC and EMS, Li
et al. [110] optimized fuel consumption for a smart parallel HEV
during  a  car-following  scenario  by  utilizing  a  nonlinear  MPC  to
synergize the ACC and EMS (see Fig. 16 ). Dynamics (e.g., follow-
ing distance, relevant speed, and jerk) and economic metrics (e.g.,

fuel consumption) are considered together to enhance the velocity
tracking performance and fuel economy. In this work, the ABR02
driving  cycle  is  followed  by  the  preceding  vehicle,  and  the  fuel
consumption is reduced by more than 5%.

In  summary,  the  main  feature  of  existing  ACC-based  EMSs  is
that  incorporating  an  ACC  into  an  EMS  has  a  significant  poten-
tial  for  procuring  fuel  savings,  and  increasing  comfort  and  fuel
economy.  It  is  essential  that  such  a  scheme  should  be  imple-
mentable in real-time. Thus, it is significant to seek a judicious bal-
ance between the computational time and overall performance in
fuel economy, safety, and comfort. This type of strategy examines
the driving safety and fuel economy in a synergistic way during
vehicle  following  scenarios,  without  considering  dynamic  traffic
conditions.

5.2. PCC-based EMSs

It is well acknowledged that the prediction of future velocity
plays a great role in devising an advanced PCC. Moreover, in this
case, the preceding vehicle behavior would have a significant im-
pact on the following vehicle. As such, in [111] , the prediction of
the preceding vehicle velocity is investigated to explore the fuel
benefits  for  a  cooperative  adaptive  cruise  controller(CACC)  using
nonlinear autoregressive models with the predecessor information
from V2V and V2I communication. Similar work is also presented
in [112] . Thus, PCC-based EMSs are developed to fully exploit the
future information by predicting the velocity of the preceding ve-
hicle.  More  specifically,  the  optimal  velocity  and  power  split  for
the subject vehicle are determined utilizing the predictive control
algorithm (e.g. an MPC) with the prediction of the preceding vehi-
cle velocity via exploiting the available traffic or road information

obtained from ITS. The schematic of PCC-based EMSs is shown in
Fig. 17 .

To investigate the potential of integrating a PCC into an electri-
fied vehicle, Zhang et al. [113] optimized energy consumption of a
fully electric vehicle (FEV) with the preceding vehicle movement
prediction implemented by a Bayes network (BN), as well as road
terrain profiles. The preceding vehicle’s velocity can be transmit-
ted  through  the  V2V  communication  (see  Fig.  18 ).  In  this  work,
the cost function includes the motor energy consumption in each
control horizon and the safety distance from the preceding vehi-
cle. The fuel economy of the FEV can be further improved by in-
troducing the prediction of the preceding vehicle velocity into an
energy-efficient driving control strategy. In [114] , a hybrid MPC is
also  introduced  into  the  energy  management  optimization  for  a
FEV with the prediction of the preceding vehicle velocity by merg-
ing the PCC and energy optimization.

For  the  prediction  of  preceding  vehicle  velocity,  stochastic
methods  (e.g.,  Gaussian  Process)  are  utilized.  Morlock  et  al.
[115] devised an economic PCC based on the velocity prediction

of the leading vehicle with a Gaussian Process approach for elec-
tric vehicles, which considers real time traffic data obtained from
a  cloud  server.  This  approach  can  significantly  improve  the  pre-
diction accuracy and reduce energy consumption. Sakhdari et al.
[116] also developed an Eco-ACC controller that is superior to the
PID-ACC  for  PHEVs  by  utilizing  the  radar  data  and  traffic  light
time schedule through V2I communication. This controller aims to
enhance  fuel  economy,  safety,  and  comfort  in  car-following  sce-
narios (see Fig. 19 ) by merging velocity optimization and energy
management, with probabilistic prediction of the preceding vehicle
velocity.

The power-split decision of PHEVs during vehicle following is
mainly  examined  without  emphasizing  the  SOC  planning  in  the
aforementioned literature. To tackle this issue, Xie et al. [117] de-
veloped a predictive energy management scheme integrating fuel
economy and driving safety for a PHEV during vehicle following
scenarios. An integrated MPC is employed to plan the velocity and
SOC trajectory over each prediction horizon to improve fuel econ-
omy and driving safety, which utilized an artificial neural network

to predict the velocity of the preceding vehicle. This strategy effi-
ciently considers the integration of the SOC planning, power split,
and inter-vehicle distance control.

To sum up, PCC-based EMSs are to exploit the prediction in-
formation of the preceding vehicle during car-following scenarios
considering the safety, fuel economy, and comfort simultaneously,
pursuing an enhanced overall performance. The traffic disturbances
are considered in the prediction of the preceding vehicle, which
renders the approach more robust to changing traffic conditions.
In particular, future dynamic uncertainty is merged into EMSs to
improve their adaptability and resilience. It is essential to include
the prediction of preceding vehicle velocity in EMSs to capture the
important dynamics of varying traffic conditions that considerably
affect vehicular fuel consumption.

To  show  the  features  of  these  two  strategies  clearly,  a  com-
parison  is  summarized  in  Table  2 .  The  ACC-based  EMSs  mainly
focus  on  reducing  fuel  consumption,  utilizing  specific  driving
cycles  to  act  as  preceding  vehicle  velocity,  without  involving
dynamic driving conditions. However, the dynamic traffic informa-
tion  is  fully  deployed  to  predict  the  velocity  of  preceding  vehi-
cle for PCC-based EMSs, further enhancing fuel economy. Both of
them consider safety and fuel economy in optimizing powertrain
controls.

6. Multi-vehicle energy management strategies

In  the  preceding  sections,  EMSs  in  the  single-vehicle  and
double-vehicle scenarios with GPS, ITS, and V2V/V2I information
are  discussed.  This  idea  can  be  extended  to  multiple  connected
HEVs/PHEVs to obtain an improved overall performance in terms of
fuel economy and traffic efficiency. This can generally be regarded
in the form of platooning. The platooning is appealing, thanks to
the reality that it offers energy savings from aerodynamic drafting,
more stable vehicle following dynamics, reduced traffic flow dis-
turbances, as well as potential safety improvements [118] . As the

connected vehicle technologies have been being developed rapidly,
EMSs of a platoon of HEVs have received more attention, with an
important intent to devise an EMS for each HEV to improve the
system mobility, safety and global fuel economy incorporating traf-
fic light information and interactions among multiple vehicles. To
this end, great effort s have been made to propose a holistically co-
operative energy management in this area. The multi-vehicle en-
ergy  management  scenario  is  shown  in  Fig.  20 .  Specifically,  the
optimal velocity of each HEV can be generated with the traffic in-
formation (e.g., traffic light phase and time) and the preceding ve-
hicle velocity that can be transmitted to the subsequent neighbor-
hood vehicle via V2V communication, and the power split decision
is used to improve fuel economy of individual vehicle, as well as
for the platoon as a whole by tracking the optimal velocity with an
algorithm (e.g., A-ECMS). In this scenario, vehicles can share infor-
mation with each other via V2V communication, and both of safety
and fuel economy are considered for a platoon of vehicles. Gener-
ally, the driver behavior is not considered at the present work.

To investigate the benefits of incorporating the traffic informa-
tion into powertrain optimziation, Mohd Zulkefli et al. [119] pre-
dicted the interactive behavior among vehicles utilizing a Gipps’car
following model sharing real-time traffic information with the V2V
and V2I communication. With the predicted velocity trajectory, the
EMS  of  each  vehicle is  devised by combining Pontryagin’s  Mini-
mum Principle with the charge-sustaining constraint. The simula-
tion results validate that fuel efficiency and mobility can be im-
proved. Qiu et al. [120] developed a new hierarchical global en-
ergy management strategy for a platoon of connected four-wheel-
drive HEVs in urban road conditions. The target velocity is gener-
ated utilizing the signal phase and timing information (SPAT), and
the optimal velocity of each HEV is determined with an MPC com-
promising fuel economy, safety, and mobility. DP, as a lower level
controller, is utilized to split the power between the engine and
motor  for  each  HEV,  while  tracking  the  optimal  velocity.  Hom-
chaudhuri  et  al.  [121,122]  proposed  an  energy  management

251

optimized concurrently [129] . It is generally difficult to directly op-
timize them simultaneously, due to the intensively coupling nature
of  the  nonlinear augmented system  (e.g.,  synergistic vehicle and
powertrian controls). To this end, Ghasemi et al. [130] investigated
a power management approach based on Pontryagin’s minimum
principle (PMP) for multiple HEVs, given a flexibility in power de-
mand,  instead  of  strictly  following  the  required  power  from  the
vehicle level. Zhao et al. [131] also proposed a two-level optimiza-
tion architecture, including both vehicle and powertrain levels, to
enhance fuel efficiency by optimizing the velocity and power split
simultaneously for autonomous and connected PHEVs.

It can be concluded that exploiting the V2V and V2I informa-
tion in EMSs exhibits a great potential to improve the overall per-
formance of connected HEVs/PHEVs. This is essential to ensure the
safety, system mobility, and energy-saving of multiple connected
HEVs. Additionally, this methodology can also be ultilized in fully
autonomous  vehicles.  The  key  to  successful  energy  management
for a platoon of HEVs lies in advanced and robust connectivity and
sensor data. Although commercial vehicles with the infrastructure
of V2V and V2I is not yet a reality, it is believed to be realizable
in the near future. In addition, the current literature assumes that
no lane changing happens which is unrealistic in the real condi-
tions. If lane changing happens, then the optimal control problem
would become more complicated. Thus, more factors (such as lane
changing, driver behavior, traffic jams) should be further consid-
ered to improve the system mobility and fuel economy due to the
complexity of traffic conditions.

7. Outlook and future trends

From the aforementioned analysis, great efforts have been made
in  the  field  of  EMSs  for  connected  HEVs/PHEVs,  following  with
promising results. As the Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV)
technologies  evolve,  this  topic  will  offer  a  great  opportunity  for
optimizing alternative powertrains to further improve the mobil-
ity, fuel economy, driving performance, and safety. However, how
to develop an advanced EMS taking advantage of artificial intel-
ligence technology, multi-source fusion technology from a global
cyber-physical-system (CPS) perspective is a key challenge. Thus,
the future trends are suggested from the following eight perspec-
tives to encourage more innovative ideas in this area.

7.1. EMSs of connected and automated HEVs/PHEVs

It is well recognized that forecasting the vehicle state accurately
has great potentials for improvements of fuel economy of HEVs.
As  CAV  technologies  and  ITS  continue  to  evolve,  it  is  crucial  to
merge multi-source data (e.g. traffic data, route, vehicles) by ad-
vanced sensor technologies and GPS into EMSs to increase the pre-
diction accuracy of velocity. Moreover, it is helpful to consider the
influence of external environment (e.g. weather, traffic jams, and
preceding vehicles) on the velocity prediction.

Currently,  the  single-vehicle  scenario  is  mainly  concerned  in
EMSs  rather  than  a  cooperative  optimization  for  multiple  con-
nected  HEVs.  However,  the  interactions  among  human  behavior,
vehicle, and road conditions in the CAV scenario will become in-
creasingly  critical.  It  is  very  significant  to  include  these  in  the
context of safety, comfort, fuel economy, and driving performance.
Hence, how to devise an EMS for each HEV in a cooperative and in-
telligent manner while considering the coupling influence of multi-
vehicles is essential to enhance the overall performance involving
safety, system mobility, and energy efficiency for alternative auto-
motive powertrains.

In  addition,  heterogeneous  dynamics  and  stability  constitute
another  issue  due  to  the  presence  of  different  dynamic  charac-
teristics for connected multiple vehicles. A heterogeneous platoon

strategy for a group of connected HEVs, via devising a hierarchi-
cal control strategy for each HEV to improve fuel efficiency. The
higher-level  controller  of  each  HEV  is  devised  to  plan  the  eco-
driving  velocity  utilizing  the  traffic  light  time  via  V2I  and  V2V
communication. The lower-level controller (A-ECMS) is utilized to
implement the power split by tracking the optimal velocity from
the higher-level controller for every HEV. In this work, the propul-
sion  and  recurperation  efficiencies  are  considered  constant.  The
overall control framework is illustrated in Fig. 21 .

To  reflect  real  operating  characteristic  precisely,  Qiu  et  al.
[123]  presented  a  closed-loop  hierarchical  energy  management
strategy for a platoon of connected HEVs considering the efficiency
feedback  of  propulsion  and  recurperation.  An  MPC,  as  a  higher-
level  controller,  is  employed  to  determine  the  optimal  velocity
over each prediction horizon with the efficiency updated from the
lower-level controller (A-ECMS) optimizing the power split, given
the predicted velocity for each HEV. The fuel economy can be im-
proved  by  synergizing  the  red  light  stopping  reduction,  collision
avoidance, and cooperative platoon information. To fully investigate
the potential of hybridization, Ma et al. [124] put forward an inte-
grated optimization approach based on a multi-agent framework
to optimize energy efficiency at both the vehicle level and power-
train level for multiple connectd HEVs. The vehicle-to-vehicle co-
ordination and energy management control are co-optimized wit
the consideration of the powertrain and external vehicle dynam-
ics,  to  significantly increase fuel savings, assuming that  the  V2V
communication is avaliable. He et al. [125] explored an eco-driving
advisory control system for a platoon of electric vehicles and con-
ventional vehicles in the mixed-traffic, utilizing the information via
V2V and V2I communication. To assess the potential of maximiz-
ing energy efficiecny, Hovgard et al. [126] developed a cooperative
energy management for a set of connected HEVs by reducing the
braking on a hilly terrain. In the top layer, convex optimization is
adopted to optimize the velocity, travel time, and battery SOC to-
gether. At the bottom layer, the power split as well as gear shift
is determined by combining DP and ECMS. To optimize the mobil-
ity, fuel economy, and safety simultaneously, Qiu et al. [127] in-
troduced  a  hierarchical  control  framework  for  a  platoon  of  con-
nected HEVs. The velocity of each HEV is optimized based on a
stochastic model predictive control incorporating signal phase and
timing  information.  A-ECMS  is  employed  to  devise  the  EMS  for
each  HEV  as  well.  Most  of  the  literature  optimizes  the  velocity
and power split separately [128] . However, it is shown from the
U.S. Department of Energy that over 30% more fuel savings can be
achieved if the vehicle-level and powertrain-level controls can be

is  composed  of  multiple  vehicles  with  different  longitudinal  dy-
namics in [132] , which utilizes a PnG (Pulse and Glide) method to
switch the driving mode according to vehicular operational condi-
tions. The connected HEVs/PHEVs may also present heterogeneous
features. For example, vehicular parameters are different for con-
stituent cars and buses in the platooning. Thus, it is necessary to
incorporate the heterogeneity in optimizing the velocity and EMSs
to enhance fuel efficiency and maintain enough driving safety.

7.2. Driver-in-the loop EMSs of HEVs/PHEVs

Driver plays a significant role in energy-efficient driving. Most
of the literature currently ignores the human driver error in eco-
driving, leading to imperfection of tracking recommended velocity
profiles. In reality, the driver may not follow the optimal velocity
precisely. To this end, the driver-vehicle-infrastructure cooperative
framework for eco-driving is proposed considering the possible hu-
man driver errors in [133] for conventional vehicles.

As  for  connected  HEVs/PHEVs,  the  performance  of  EMSs  is
closely tied to the velocity profile, which generally does not take
into consideration the human driver behavior in optimizing the ve-
locity control and power split. They assume that the optimal ve-
locity in the higher level can be followed accurately and then the
corresponding power split is determined. However, the uncertainty
of driver behavior (e.g. lane changing, disposition) may affect the
velocity tracking performance and further contribute to fuel con-
sumption.

Although  the  subject  vehicle  may  not  “see” the  preceding
vehicles,  the  driver  information  for  the  preceding  vehicles  may
be  acquired  through  connectivity  in  the  connected  environment.
Therefore, incorporating the human driver behavior into EMSs for
connected  HEVs/PHEVs  (so  called  driver-in-the-loop  EMSs)  is  an
interesting  topic,  which  contributes  to  achieving  better  tracking
performance and potential fuel savings.

7.3. Multi-objective optimization EMSs of HEVs/PHEVs

HEVs are complicated mechatronic systems with strongly cou-
pling, nonlinear characteristic, and multiple variables. To simplify
the  optimal  control  problem,  fuel  economy  is  generally  empha-
sized  in  optimizing  the  power  split  with  many  assumptions  in
the literature. This can satisfy the basic requirement of EMS but
is  not  optimal.  In  fact,  the  battery  cycle  life  degradation  that  is
inevitable for PHEVs would affect energy efficiency. On the other
hand, predefined gear shift schedule is generally adopted for par-
allel HEVs without adaptability. Especially in connected EMSs for
HEVs/PHEVs,  utilizing  the  future  information  can  determine  the
optimal gear shift schedule. Generally, the comfort and fuel econ-
omy conflict with each other. Additionally, the safety should also
be included for car-following and multi-vehicle scenarios.

Thus, it is significant to investigate an efficient optimal EMS to
gain a tradeoff among these performance measures considering the
future information.

7.4. Learning-based EMSs of HEVs/PHEVs

The concept of learning-based EMSs is introduced in [2] , which
attempts to improve the robustness of EMSs with a combination
of machine learning and the optimal EMS. A reinforcement learn-
ing method is exploited to devise a predictive energy management
strategy for a parallel HEV. Similar work can be found in [134] as
well.  This  concept  can  also  be  extended  to  EMSs  of  connected
HEVs/PHEVs.

Conventional EMSs mainly focus on a specific driving condition
with an assumption of steady operations, leading to less robustness
and adaptability in the presence of the stochastic nature of driver

behavior  and  traffic  conditions.  In  reality,  traffic  conditions  vary
with route.  ITS can enable vehicles to access numerous external
information (e.g. traffic information, presence of surrounding vehi-
cles, and their operating variables) through connectivity. This data
can be fed back into EMSs based on cloud computing and then uti-
lized to update the control parameters in a periodical or continu-
ous manner to respond to the external environment. Motivated by
the real-time data, assimilating such data that represent the ex-
ternal stochastic information precisely can improve adaptability of
EMSs. Meanwhile, the EMS of each HEV can be devised consider-
ing the interaction between the agent and the environment based
on multi-agent techniques. This is beneficial to larger scale EMSs
for multiple connected HEVs/PHEVs.

7.5. CACC-based EMSs of HEVs/PHEVs

Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) that can improve the
safety aims to coordinate the velocity for multiple vehicles with
prediction of preceding-vehicle velocity utilizing the surrounding
vehicles  information  via  V2V/V2I  communication.  A  CACC  based
on  machine-learning  algorithms  is  developed  in  [135]  to  reduce
time gaps and improve string stability by employing the preced-
ing dynamic information via V2V and V2I communication. In [136] ,
the CACC for autonomous vehicles is proposed to obtain predic-
tive gear schedule and reduce energy consumption in a cooperative
manner.

However,  these  endeavors  are  mainly  conducted  for  conven-
tional vehicles. In recent years, with the development of advanced
V2V and V2I communication, such a CACC system provides a pos-
sibility for optimizing EMSs of HEVs with respect to system mobil-
ity, safety, and fuel economy from different levels, such as vehicle
level and powertrain level. Therefore, developing CACC-based EMSs
for a platoon of HEVs is a significant trend from local and global
perspectives, which is advantageous for improving the traffic effi-
ciency and energy benefits.

7.6. Multi-scale EMSs of HEVs/PHEVs

In  the  connected  environment,  the  velocity  optimization  and
power management are systematically considered to improve the
overall performance. The control problems are optimized at vehi-
cle and powertrain levels separately or simultaneously. However,
the velocity optimization is generally conducted over a longer time
scale  while  the  powertrain  EMS  is  optimized  on  a  shorter  one.
In addition, the engine and motor torques normally respond at a
faster  speed.  The  characteristic  in  different  time  scales  makes  it
challenging  to  explore  an  efficient  EMS  in  obtaining  an  optimal
solution. Moreover, most conventional EMS mainly focuses on ve-
locity optimization and EMS, rather than considering the dynamic
response of the powertrain.

Thus, it is important to develop an efficient hierarchical control
strategy for a multi-scale EMS to coordinate the control horizon in
obtaining the solution, enhancing the computational efficiency, and
ensuring driver and passenger comfort.

7.7. EMSs for connected HEVs/PHEVs in the multiple-vehicle scenario
considering lane-changing

In the context of the multiple-vehicle scenario, the performance
of EMSs of connected HEVs/PHEVs is generally evaluated on a sin-
gle  lane.  However,  lane-changing  (e.g.,  overtaking  and  merging)
maneuvers would happen in realistic traffic conditions, which in
turn  produces  disturbances  for  a  platoon  of  vehicles.  This  defi-
nitely impacts the performance of EMSs and thus requires a new
methodology to coordinate the connected vehicles. Some methods
are reported in [137–139] for conventional vehicles regarding the

merging and overtaking problem, which adopt stochastic controls
to minimize the probability of collision. This can also be expanded
to connected HEVs by considering the safety and fuel economy si-
multaneously. In the connected environment, the subject vehicle
can perceive the surrounding vehicles via V2V communication. In
this way, the behavior of merging and overtaking may be moni-
tored and thus reconsiders a new platooning for EMSs.

Therefore, it is very interesting to examine how to coordinate
the velocity and devise EMSs for a platoon of HEVs/PHEVs to guar-
antee fuel efficiency and mobility subject to external disturbances
(e.g., merging, overtaking).

7.8. Performance evaluation of EMSs for connected HEVs/PHEVs

Different  from  EMSs  of  unconnected  HEVs/PHEVs,  those  for
connected  vehicles  are  more  complicated  with  three  elements
needed to be considered, including 1) communication devices (e.g.,
V2V  and  V2I  equipment)  and  sensors,  2)  the  control  algorithm
to  coordinate  the  vehicle  via  V2V  and  V2I  communication,  and
3)  the  EMS  to  determine  the  optimal  power-split  in  the  power-
train level. Moreover, it is more sophisticated in the presence of
different  parameters  as  well  as  dynamic  characteristics  for  con-
nected  vehicles  on  the  road  transportation.  These  features  make
it challenging to evaluate the performance of EMSs for connected
HEVs/PHEVs, in terms of fuel economy, computational burden, and
mobility.  Simulation-based  testing  methods  can  satisfy  the  basic
requirement, rather than providing a precise approach due to the
transient  powertrain  behaviors.  To  this  end,  a  hardware-in-the-
loop (HIL) testing method for connected vehicles was developed
in [140,141] , based on a relatively simple traffic condition, which
integrates the traffic simulation network using VISSIM into a pow-
ertrain  test  bench.  However,  the  complexity  and  disturbance  of
changing traffic conditions require a more accurate method to rep-
resent real operations and develop implementable EMSs.

Thus, it is significant to systematically investigate an efficient
approach (e.g., of low cost and ease to implement) to validating
the performance of EMSs for connected vehicles considering more
comprehensive  traffic  simulations  and  incorporating  communica-
tion delays for HIL testing. Additionally, it is important to collect
real traffic data from actual roads in field tests and integrate them
into EMSs of connected HEVs/PHEVs.

8. Conclusions

In  this  paper,  EMSs  for  connected  HEVs/PHEVs  are  system-
atically  reviewed.  To  start  with,  the  main  difference  between
HEVs/PHEVs and ICE-based vehicles, in terms of engine operation,
is  elaborated.  The  importance  of  connected  vehicle  technologies
for  eco-driving  is  then  emphasized.  Second,  EMSs  of  connected
HEVs/PHEVs are classified. Three scenarios, i.e., the single-vehicle,
double-vehicle,  and  multi-vehicle  cases,  are  systematically  ana-
lyzed, according to the level of optimization. Various approaches
in the literature are evaluated in terms of their underlying princi-
ples, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, some important future
trends as well as an outlook are offered.
