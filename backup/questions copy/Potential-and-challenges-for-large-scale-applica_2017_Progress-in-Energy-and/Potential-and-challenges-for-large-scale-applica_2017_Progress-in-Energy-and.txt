1. Introduction

PGlobal population is predicted to exceed 9 billion by 2050 there-
fore significantly higher fuel quantity would be required to meet the
energy requirements in future [1]. BP Statistical Review showed that
total proven oil reserves in the world crossed 1700 billion barrels in
2014 (Fig. 1), which is enough to meet »50 years of global energy
demand only [2]. However one should note with caution that such
estimates are not very reliable and have to be considered carefully in
estimating the assured energy supply for the future. This shrinking
energy supply needs to be augmented by newer energy resources,
preferably with the ones that recycle atmospheric GHG emissions so
that increase in earth's temperature can be kept under check. In past
couple of decades, development and use of various alternative fuels,
particularly biofuels has attracted global attention. Biofuels are very

Pattractive fuel option because they offer several promising benefits
such as reduced dependence on fossil fuels and a potential to slow-
down global climatic change, in addition to potential to grow on
fallow lands and potential for rural job creation [3].

PIt emerges that the sustainable alternative fuels should be
renewable, efficient, cost-effective and less polluting compared
to conventional fossil fuels [4,5]. There are several biofuel candi-
dates developed over past few decades however the main bio-
fuels being considered seriously are biodiesel and D
Xethanol. They
are most acceptable biofuels because of minor or no modifica-
tions required in the engine hardware, easier fuel production
technology, capability to use existing fuel delivery infrastructure
and economic viability [4,6]. Though the thermal properties such
as calorific value, cetane number, and volatility characteristics of
biodiesel are very close to that of D
Xmineral diesel, there are con-
siderable differences in some important physical properties of
the two fuels, such as density, viscosity, pour point etc. Biodiesel
has higher viscosity and density, 10(cid:1)15% lower calorific value,
higher bulk modulus, higher oxygen content, and lower stoichio-
metric air-fuel ratio compared to baseline mineral diesel [7(cid:1)9].
Currently, engine control parameters can be tuned according to
fuel properties, so that the engine can comply with prevailing
emission norms. Biodiesel can be produced from various feed-
stocks and its D
Xfeedstock properties and the
production process used to a great extent. Biodiesel properties
influence engine performance and emission characteristics. For
ensuring successful implementation of biodiesel in transport sec-
tor, several biodiesel production techniques were developed and
tested on variety of feedstocks so that good quality biodiesel can
be produced at economically feasible cost.

Xproperties depend on D

PThere are a large number of experimental studies published
in open literature summarizing biofuel research e.g. Xue et al. [10]
reviewed biodiesel research published between 2000(cid:1)2011.

review article focused on finding the effect of biodiesel on engine

Imdadul

fuelled by biodiesel and biodiesel-diesel blends with and without
additives. Moser [15] reviewed different biodiesel production pro-
cesses and focused on reviewing the effect of FFAs, usD
Xe of different
monohydric alcohols, and different catalysts. In addition, influence
of biodiesel composition, blending with other fuels, alternative
usage for biodiesel and glycerol were also discussed in this review
article. Sharma et al. [16] reviewed biodegradability, biodiesel pro-
duction kinetics, and stability aspects of biodiesel. Basha et al. [17]
reviewed biodiesel production processes, and engine combustion,
performance and emission characteristics. Atabani et al. [18] criti-
cally reviewed biodiesel feedstocks, biodiesel production methods,
properties and biodiesel quality, problems and potential solutions
for using vegetable oil, advantages and disadvantages of biodiesel
usage, economic viability and future prospects for biodiesel
in
their review article. Shameer et al. [19] reviewed the operating
parameter discrepancies in engine emissions reported in different
engines fuelled by biodiesel produced from different feedstocks by
Xvarious researchers.

PMost of these review articles focused on very limited canvass of
biodiesel and didn't offer a comprehensive and updated picture. This
review article is an attempt to fill this space in biodiesel domain
since it covers most aspects related to biodiesel production, biodie-
sel utilization, engine performance, and combustion studies, emis-
sion characteristics, both gaseous and D
Xparticulate emissions, long-
term durability aspects, effect of biodiesel on fuel injection system,
carbon deposits, material compatibility, wear and lubricating oil
degradation in addition to economic analysis and provides D
Xan up-to-
date and comprehensive picture. Fig. 2 shows the glimpse of the
topics covered in this review article.

2. Biodiesel production potential: feedstock and availability

PBiodiesel can be produced from straight vegetable oils (SVOs)
such as Rapeseed, Soybean, Pongamia, Jatropha, Mustard, Jojoba,
Flax, Sunflower, Palm, Coconut, Hemp, Waste vegetable oil (WVO)
etc., animal fats including tallow, lard, yellow grease, chicken fat and
by-products from the production of Omega-3 fatty acids from fish
oil [20]. Algae, which can be grown using waste sewage water or
Xshallow ocean water without displacing land used for food

production capacity is expected to be 24.9 billion liters in 2016,
which will increase to 25.5 billion liters in 2017 [24]. Germany,
France, Netherlands, Spain, and Poland are the top five biodiesel
producing countries in EU. Annual biodiesel production capacity
in Germany increased from 3.2 billion liters in 2010 to 3.8 billion

Ppolicy goals, a concerted effort was necessary. Austria is doing
exceedingly well on this count and has already achieved EU target of
10% biofuels in 2010, and expects to reach 20% biofuels usage goal
by 2020. In the transport sector, Denmark achieved the EU target of
5.75% by 2010 and expects to attain target of 10% by 2020 [27(cid:1)28].
For encouraging research and implementation of second and third
generation biofuels, EU is considering substitution of first generation
Xby second and third generation biofuels. This
biodiesel usage targets D
trend is catching up in North America, Asia, South America and Aus-
tralia, which also produce biodiesel commercially albeit on a smaller
scale. This trend is also catching up in large economies such as India
and China, which have huge dependence on imported petroleum.
South Asia has a large number of non-edible vegetable oil species
(300 C), which are available in surplus quantities. Potential availabil-
ity of such non-edible oils in India alone is roughly 1 million tons per
year [29]. The surplus oil available in abundance are Sal oil (180,000
tons), Mahua oil (180,000 tons), Neem oil (100,000 tons) and Karanja
oil (55,000 tons) annually. Biodiesel policy of Government of India
recognizes non-edible Pongamia Pinnata (Karanja) and Jatropha Cur-
cas (Jatropha) oils as the most promising feedstocks for biodiesel
production in Indian context. However due to shorter gestation
period, Jatropha Curcas has got prominence over Pongamia pin-
nata as major feedstock for India's biodiesel program [30(cid:1)31].
The seed production potential of Jatropha reportedly ranges from
»0.4 tons/ha/year to > 12 tons/ha/year [30]. Neglecting such a
Xpoor planning in large-
large variation in Jatropha production,
scale implenetation has resulted in discouraging results and has
created doubts about the benefits of biofuels, their potential and
financial viability [32]. D
XJatropha can be grown in areas with low
rainfall (200 mm/year), on low fertility, marginal, degraded, fal-
low and waste lands but seed yield is lower under these condi-
tions. On the other hand, Pongamia Pinnata is one of the few
nitrogen fixing trees (NFT) whichD

(w/w) oil content. It is often planted as an ornamental and shade
tree. Average seed yield of Pongamia Pinnata is reportedly
»4(cid:1)9 tons/ha/year [33]. Rice-bran oil
is also an underutilized
non-edible vegetable oil, which is available in large quantities in
rice cultivating countries including India and China, however
very little research has been done to utilize this oil as a partial/
full replacement of mineral diesel [34].

X produces seeds D

PSome studies have suggested that biofuels derived from agri-
cultural food crops have adverse social and economic impact on
the global population and has created ‘food versus fuel’ conflict
in the society whereas there are some studies refuting the pos-
sibility of such a conflict [35]. Biofuels generated from non-
edible oilseeds such as Pongamia Pinnata, Jatropha Curcas, high
erucic Mustard, green seed Canola, micro algae, etc. [36] bypass
the ‘food versus fuel’ dilemmaD
X. In such a controversial situation,
non-edible vegetable oils have emerged as the most suitable
biodiesel feedstocks because the demand for edible oils exceeds
domestic supply and many large developing economies are net
importers of edible oils. Significant fraction of edible oils pro-
duced worldwide are converted to biodiesel. Approx. 95% of bio-
diesel in the world is produced using edible vegetable oils [37].
Using edible vegetable oil for producing biodiesel increases its
cost as well as the cost of food due to reduced availability of
vegetable oils. Therefore use of non-edible oil for biodiesel pro-
duction can reduce the foodD
X price inflation. Non-edible crops
can be planted in many parts of the world, which have huge
swaths of waste land. This will reduce deforestation rate and
avoid competition with the food crops. Moreover, non-edible
vegetable oil crops and trees are more efficient and environ-
ment friendly [37]. Global agricultural land area has increased
from 4.56 billion ha in 1970 to 4.89 billion ha in 2010, however

Pincrease in global population [38(cid:1)39]. Production of corn and
oilseeds, which can be used for either food/
feed, or fuel/
energy, have sharply increased with their harvest areas expand-
ing by 30.6 and 82.2 million hectares respectively, from 1990 to
2010 [40].

PVegetable oil prices in international market fluctuates just
like any other commodity, depending on the feedstock, and
its demand e.g. in August 2012, soybean oil was priced at US
$ 1230/t, while palm oil was priced at US $ 931/t [41]. Feedstock

3. Biodiesel production using transesterification of oils

PBiodiesel is produced by transesterification of triglycerides pres-
ent in SVOs/ animal fats on an industrial scale. Transesterification is
the reaction of triglycerides present in vegetable oils/ animal fats
with primary alcohols in presence/ absence of a catalyst. D

cost is the most crucial factor affecting biodiesel production
cost. Therefore use of less expensive feedstocks such as used
cooking oil (priced at US $ 331/t) and non-edible vegetable oils
like Jatropha (priced between US $ 350/t to US $ 500/t) is gain-
ing momentum [41]. Biodiesel derived from edible oils is more
expensive than that from non-edible oilsD
X, with negative global
economic impact as feedstock prices escalate. With global tar-
gets of at least 10% biodiesel usage by 2020, it makes economic
sense to carry out research and exploit biofuels derived from
waste cooking oils, non-edible oils, and algal biomass to D
Xreduce
production costs in comparison to mineral diesel.

PZhang et al. [42] reported that biodiesel cost was > 1.5 times
that of mineral diesel, while the cost of waste cooking oil was
»2.5 to 3 times cheaper than virgin vegetable oil [43]. In addi-
tion, the cost of virgin vegetable oil accounts for 75(cid:1)80% of bio-
diesel production cost, whereas waste cooking oil accounts for
only 50% of direct manufacturing cost of biodiesel, therefore bio-
diesel from WCO turns out to be significantly cheaper [44]. It is
amply clear that the cost of biodiesel production is directly dic-
tated by the feedstock cost. Biodiesel production from edible oils
depends on the price dictated by the international market,
whereas the prices of waste cooking oil and non-edible oils such
as Jatropha and Karanja are not influenced by the international
market therefore they do not fluctuate significantly and biodiesel
can be produced from them at a significantly cheaper cost. The
availability of such oils is however less than canola or soybean
oils. Moreover, waste cooking oil requires additional processing
for purification, whereas production of
Jatropha and Karanja
could be limited by its low market value, which D

tivation on arable lands less appealing, however it D
Xmay be eco-
nomically viable to cultivate them on marginal/ fallow lands

PTransesterification is a reversible reaction. Higher than stoichio-
metric alcohol quantity is used to force the reaction equilibrium
towards product side. Methanol and ethanol are the most frequently
used primary alcohols in this process. Most of the experimental
studies reviewed suggest that alcohol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1 with
catalyst concentration in the range of 0.2(cid:1)1.5% (w/woil) at 65 °C
reaction temperature is optimum for completion of transesterifica-
tion reactions [7]. Methanol is preferred over ethanol for biodiesel

Xskin upon exposure. On the other hand, ethanol is more
absorbed by D
hygroscopic than methanol and it D
Xdemonstrates higher affinity
towards moisture. Ethanol can even absorb moisture from ambient
air, if exposed directly, which is a negative aspect of considering eth-
anol for transesterification reaction's reactant. Methanol and ethanol
are also completely miscible with water hence any accidental spill
presents a serious ecological challenge [45]. In comparison to metha-
nol, toxicity of ethanol is significantly lower. Current industrial pro-
duction of ethanol is from agricultural products therefore utilization
of ethanol for biodiesel production, makes it a completely renewable
fuel however it runs the risk of “FoodD
X.versus Fuel” dichotomy
[45(cid:1)46]. Due to an extra carbon atom, ethyl esters have marginally
higher calorific value and cetane number vis-(cid:1)a-vis methyl esters.
Ethyl esters also offer superior cold flow properties compared to
methyl esters [45(cid:1)46]. Type of catalyst (alkaline, acidic or enzy-
matic), catalyst concentration, alcohol/ vegetable oil molar ratio,
reaction temperature, moisture content, and FFA content of the veg-
etable oil affect ester yield from D

to grow fuel crops (non-edible vegetable oils/ biomass) on fallow
and non-fertile lands. This will help afforestation, and limit envi-
ronment impact of fuel usage.

PConversion of triglycerides into fatty acid alkyl esters can be
efficiently executed using different catalysts. Alkaline and acidic
homogeneous catalysts are the most commonly used catalysts.
For feedstocks with low FFA content, alkali catalyzed transesteri-
fication is an efficient and fast biodiesel production method.
However for feedstocks with high FFA content, base-catalyzed
transesterification gives very low yield of biodiesel [49,50]. For
feedstocks with high FFA content, acid-catalyzed esterification
should be used however this reaction is very slow D
X to
alkali catalyzed transesterification [51] and requires higher alco-
hol-to-oil molar ratioD
X [50,52]. A two-step process involving
reduction of FFA by acid catalyzed esterification, followed by
alkali catalyzed transesterification is considered to be a superior
process compared to one step esterification process for biodiesel
production from high FFA feedstocks [49,53,54]. Utilization of
homogeneous catalyst adds separation and purification steps to
X for ensuring compliance with pre-
biodiesel production processD
vailing biodiesel specifications [48]. Contamination of glycerol
produced in homogeneous catalyzed transesterification by the
catalyst affects glycerol quality adversely, which reduces the
value of D
Xglycerol produced. During industrial scale biodiesel pro-
duction, large quantity of contaminated waste water is also gen-
erated because multiple water washing steps of biodiesel are
necessary for removing the catalyst from it. Water washing steps
also remove traces of glycerol, and methanol in addition to the
catalyst from the biodiesel produced [55]. Catalyst contaminated
water is an environmental hazard and needs safe disposal. It is
very difficult to recover and reuse the homogeneous catalyst
from it. The problems related to disposal of contaminated waste
water,
loss of catalyst, and reduction in process yield can be
eliminated to a certain extent by using heterogeneous catalysts
and enzymes. However these catalysts give lower biodiesel yield
at significantly higher cost D
X to homogeneous catalysts

[52,56]. Catalytic activity of methoxides is superior to that of

process involving acid catalyzed esterification followed by base
catalyzed transesterification are the three most popular methods
of biodiesel production using homogeneous catalysts. Potassium
hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium methoxide and sodium
methoxide are the most commonly used basic catalysts. Fig. 3 shows
the effect of FFAs on the yield of methyl esters during alkali cata-
lyzed transesterification process. There is D
Xsignificant drop in the
ester conversion, when the FFA content increases beyond 2% (4 mg
KOH/g) in the feedstock [62(cid:1)64]. Keeping this in mind, Ma et al. [65]
and Zhang et al. [66] recommended the upper limit of 1% FFA con-
tent for use of D

Xalkaline catalysts.

PAlcohol-to-oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and catalyst
concentration are the other most important factors affecting biodie-
sel yield from transesterification process, while using homogeneous
catalysts. Table 3 summarizes a large number of experimental stud-
ies aimed to optimize the single step transesterification reaction
conditions and yield of biodiesel using alkaline and acidic catalysts.

PAlcohol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1 with catalyst concentration in
the range of 0.2(cid:1)1.5% (w/w) at 65 °C reaction temperature was suffi-
cient for the completion of transesterification reactions in most of

Pthe studies reviewed. Some studies [46,67,68,71,73] reported
completion of base catalyzed transesterification within 1 h at
temperature below 40 °C. For high FFA feedstocks, acid catalyzed
transesterification was more effective than base catalyzed transes-
terification however it was sensitive to traces of moisture in the
feedstock [50,59]. Higher cost of methoxides can be partially offset
by savings in biodiesel purification step. Strong acids like Sulphuric
acid (H2SO4) and Hydrochloric acid (HCl) are the most commonly
used acid catalysts in acid catalyzed transesterification process [49,D
X78,D
X79]. However due to higher corrosiveness, HCl is not preferred for
commercial production of biodiesel. For efficient conversion of tri-
glycerides using acid catalysts, moisture content of the feedstock
should be less than 0.5% (w/w) for achieving greater than 90%
biodiesel yield [50]. Kusdiana et al. [59] reported 20% reduction in
biodiesel yield for 1% (w/w) moisture content and zero yield for
5% (w/w) moisture content in the feedstock using acid catalyzed
transesterification process. Higher molar ratio of alcohol-to-oil
(> 20:1) and catalyst (< 5% w/w) is required for completing the reac-
tion in 3 h. With higher acidic catalyst concentration, lower alcohol-
to-oil ratio may be used [79,52]. For accelerating the reaction rate,
higher temperature (90(cid:1)95 °C) [77,79] can be employed in case of
acidic catalysts. This suggests that more severe reaction conditions
are required for acid catalyzed transesterification reactions com-
pared to base catalyzed transesterification reactions. Requirement of

Phigher quantities of alcohols and catalysts, longer reaction duration,
and corrosion of equipment by strong acids coupled with difficulty
in separating biodiesel from excess alcohol used in the process
makes acid catalyzed transesterification process unsuitable for
industrial scale biodiesel production [49,81].

PIn view of these limitations of acid catalyzed transesterifica-
Xof FFA con-
tion process, a two-step process involving reduction D
tent of D
Xfeedstock by acid catalyzed esterification in the first step,
followed by transesterification of mixture of fatty acid esters,
remaining FFA and triglycerides by base-catalyzed transesterifi-
cation in the second step is used commercially. Table 4 summa-
rizes a large number of experimental studies aimed to optimize
X-step biodiesel production reaction conditions (in both steps)
twoD
and biodiesel yield.

PIn two-step process, effectiveness of acid catalyzed esterification
process in converting FFA into esters is utilized for D
Xreduction of FFA
content of the feedstock. First step of esterification process can be
completed using 6:1 molar ratio of alcohol-to-oil, with acidic cata-
lyst (2% w/woil) in 1 h reaction duration as indicated in Table 4
by several studies. After this step, water and glycerol formed are
separated and normal base catalyzed transesterification process is
carried out, as discussed earlier (Table 3) [44,82,85]. However, two

PBiodiesel yield and time required for completion of reactions are
also dependent on the intensity of mixing during homogeneous
transesterification process because alcohol and triglyceride are
immiscible fluids, which form two separate layers due to different
densities and incompatible mixing characteristics [50,56,86]. High
mixing intensity increases the mass transfer rate by dispersing the
alcohol in triglyceride phase as tiny droplets, thereby increasing the
contact area between these two immiscible reactants [87].

PEffect of mixing also has profound effect on biodiesel yield and
has been an area of interest for several studies, with an objective to
increase biodiesel yield and enhance the effectiveness of biodiesel
production process. Meher et al. [69] reported that 180 rpm stirring
speed was not enough for methanolysis reaction however with
increased stirring speed ofD
X 360 and 600 rpm for 3 h, 97% biodiesel
yield was obtained. Stavarache et al. [88] and Thanh et al. [89] used
ultrasonic irradiation assisted mixing for increasing the mass trans-
fer between alcohol and triglyceride phases for biodiesel production.
Ultrasonic irradiations causesD
X cavitation of bubbles near the phase
boundary between immiscible liquid phases. The asymmetric col-
lapse of cavitation bubbles disrupts the phase boundary and starts
emulsification instantly. Santos et al. [90] reported 98(cid:1)99% biodiesel
yield (without heating) using ultrasonic energy with 2(cid:1)3 times
lower concentration of base catalyst in relatively shorter duration
(10(cid:1)40 min). In summary, stirring speed and method of mixing the
two separable phases of alcohol and triglycerides also need to be
optimized for a given feedstock for optimum biodiesel D

Xyield.

3.2. Heterogeneous catalysts

PProduction of biodiesel using homogeneous catalysts is kineti-
cally the fastest method of biodiesel production with moderate
energy requirement during the process therefore it is economically
very attractive method for commercial production [91]. However
requirement of phase separation and issues related to disposal of
contaminated waste water, are the main motivation for exploring
application of heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production. An
ideal biodiesel production method should be based on a continuous
flow reaction that does not deactivateD
Xthe catalyst, and
minimizes/ eliminates the need for downstream separation of prod-
ucts as well asD
Xpurification steps. With the aim of developing a con-
tinuous production process with reusable heterogeneous catalysts,
zeolites, hydrotalcites, oxides, g-alumina, resins etc. have been
investigated for biodiesel production [50]. Performance of some of
these important heterogeneous catalysts used in various experimen-
tal studies is summarized in Table 5.

Xor consumeD

PTable 5 suggests that more severe reaction conditions and higher
quantities of alcohols are required for heterogeneous catalyzed
transesterification reactions. Requirement of higher quantities of

Palcohols and exotic catalysts, and longer reaction duration makes
heterogeneous catalyzed transesterification process less preferred
for industrial scale biodiesel production as of now however this pro-
cess holds great potential for improvements in yield and may possi-
bly emerge as the cheapest process for biodiesel production on a
commercial scale in future.

3.3. Enzymatic catalysts

PMany researchers have D

Xinvestigated using enzymes as catalysts
for transesterification of triglycerides for biodiesel production.
Extracellular lipases and intracellular lipases are the two classes of
enzymatic catalysts normally considered for biodiesel production.
In case of extracellular lipases, the enzymes are recovered from
live micro-organisms broth and then purified, while intracellular
lipases remain either inside the cell or in the cell producing walls
[102(cid:1)104]. Both extracellular and intracellular lipases are immobili-
X when used as catalysts, which eliminates downstream processD
zedD
steps such as separation of glycerol and recycling of
lipases
[103,104]. Immobilized enzymes are defined as “enzymes physically
confined or localized in a certain defined region of space with reten-
Xcan be used repeatedly and con-
tion of their catalytic activities, and D
tinuously” [105]. Extracellular lipases give higher biodiesel yield in
comparison to intracellular lipases however they have relatively
higher cost due to complex separation and purification procedure
involved in their production [102]. Catalytic activity of different
lipases is dependent on different structural features of acyl- chains
such as nature of acyl- source (free acid, alkyl ester, glycerol ester
etc.), chain length, position of double bonds, configuration of double
bonds, and presence of branched groups [102]. In transesterification
process of biodiesel production, methanol and ethanol are the most
commonly used acyl- receptors due to their excess availability and
low cost [102]. However inactivation of lipases in presence of higher
concentrations of alcohols reduces biodiesel yield [106]. Inactivation
of lipases can be overcome by step-wise addition of methanol and
ethanol to the reaction mixture [55,107], using organic solvents and
using other acyl-acceptors such as methyl acetate [108], ethyl ace-
tate [109], 1-butanol [110], diesel [111] etc. Hexane, acetone, petro-
leum ether [112] and t-butanol [113] are commonly used solvents.
Difficulties associated with solvent recovery discourages use of sol-
vents for prevention of lipase inactivation at an industrial scale
[103]. Use of diesel as solvent simplifies this process because there is
no need to separate organic solvents from the final product and can
be used in engines without any issues [111].

PIn lipase catalyzed biodiesel production, water plays multiple
roles since it strongly influences catalytic activity as well as the sta-
bility of lipases [114]. Trace of water is essential in order to keep the
enzymes active in the organic solvent [102]. Lipase activation by

Ptemperature and critical pressure of methanol are 512.4 K and
8.0 MPa respectively [60,118]. Increasing the reaction temperature
and methanol-to-oil molar ratio has favorable effect on the ester
yield [118]. Biodiesel yield is not adversely affected by presence of
moisture (Fig. 4) and FFAs in the feedstock, since FFAs are also con-
verted simultaneously into esters in D
Xsupercritical alcoholysis process
[64,117(cid:1)121].

PKusdiana et al. [59] investigated the effect of moisture on methyl
ester yield in D
Xsupercritical alcoholysis at 42:1 molar ratio of metha-
nol-to-oil, and 350 °C and 43 MPa reaction temperature and pressure
respectively. Biodiesel yield was »100% for 5% moisture content in
the reactants. In comparison, 5% moisture content in the reactants
led to biodiesel yield dropping to »70% and < 5% in case of alkali-
catalyzed and acid-catalyzed transesterification processes respec-
tively. They also reported 95% biodiesel yield from waste palm oil
with 61% water content and 21% FFA content. There are several stud-
ies conducted on supercritical alcoholysis of vegetable oils for bio-
diesel production, which are summarized D

Xin Table 6.

PMadras et al. [124] investigated the yield of biodiesel in super-
critical alcoholysis process using methanolD
Xand ethanol, at different
reaction temperatures (Fig. 5). At 400 °C, 96% conversion (Fig. 5) of
oil to biodiesel was reported using methanol-to-oil ratio of 40:1.
For ethanol under the same reaction conditions, biodiesel yield
was found to be slightly higher because the solubility of ethanol
in D
Xvegetable oil was higher than methanol [124]. Absence of pre-
treatment steps, soap removal step and catalyst removal step
significantly reduce the cost of biodiesel plant however the oper-
ating cost of the plant increases because of use of higher temper-

mercial biodiesel production [60]. However there is by and large
agreement in the scientific community that supercritical alcohol-
ysis D
Xhas great potential for production of high quality biodiesel

diesel production at a commercial scale.

3.5. Separation and purification of biodiesel

PProducts of transesterification include a mixture of fatty acid
Xexcess alcohol traces, moisture
alkyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerol,D
and catalyst. Glycerol is denser than esters therefore it can be easily
separated by gravity separation and is collected atD
Xthe bottom of the
separating vessel [48,125,126]. In a commercial biodiesel production
plant, centrifuge is used sometimes for increasing the separation
speed [126,127]. Crude biodiesel obtained after glycerol removal
contains residual catalyst, moisture, unreacted alcohol, free glycerol,
and soaps, which may have generated during transesterification pro-
cess [48]. In presence of acids, soaps are converted into water soluble
salts and FFA [128]. Therefore acid is added to crude biodiesel for

Pwater involves conformational changes in the enzyme, which is
dependent on the availability of an oil-water interface [115]. There-
fore transesterification product yield depends on the size of oil-
water interfacial area, which can be increased by addition of water.
Higher quantity of water however starts encouraging D

reactions, which reduces D
Optimal water content is therefore a compromise between maximiz-
ing enzymatic activity by increasing the interfacial area and mini-
mizing hydrolysis reactions, and must be evaluated for each given
lipase [102,103].

PAs of now, use of enzymatic catalysts for transesterification of tri-
glycerides for biodiesel production is still in research phase and the
technology D
Xhas not matured enough to be deployed for production
of biodiesel at a commercial scale economically. The future of this
route of biodiesel production is essentially dependent on reducing
the production cost of enzymatic catalysts, which could deliver
higher biodiesel yield.

3.4. Supercritical alcoholysis

PBiodiesel production using transesterification of triglycerides
requires purification steps for catalyst removal, which increases the
production cycle time, reduces biodiesel yield and generates large
quantity of contaminated waste water. All these factors increase the
cost of final product i.e. biodiesel [60,116,117]. Supercritical alcohol-
ysis is a method, which can potentially overcome some of these
issues. In supercritical alcoholysis, mixture of vegetable oil and alco-
hol is heated to a high temperature (350(cid:1)400 °C) in a pressurized
reactor (450(cid:1)650 bar) without any catalyst [60,61]. The critical

refined biodiesel was heated with Na2SO4 (10% w/wbiodiesel) for
12 h and then filtered. In the refining process using polysulfone, the
refining losses of the ester reduced to 8.1%, in comparison to 15.2%

PProcess economics and biodiesel yield from different processes
are ultimately influenced by the reactants including type and quan-
tity of catalyst (alkaline/ acidic/ combination of the two/ enzymatic/
super-critical alcoholysis/ heterogeneous), alcohol/ oil molar ratio,
reaction temperature and pressure, reaction duration etc. in addition
to complexity of unit operations for purification and handling waste
streams. While efforts are being made to improve existing processes,
Xreview of the studies given above, it is amply clear that hetero-
fromD
geneous catalysis for transesterification and supercritical alcoholysis
appear to have great potential for continuous biodiesel production
due to availability of wide variety of regeneratable basic and acidic
solid catalysts, low sensitivity to both FFA and moisture content in
the reactants, reduced unit operation costs with simple product sep-
aration and purification steps, and no need for neutralization pro-
cess. Biodiesel yield in excess of 90% can be obtained from these
two processes after suitable parameteric optimization.

3.6. Life cycle analysis of biodiesel

PLife cycle analysis (LCA) and economics of biodiesel is very criti-
cal for taking decisions about economic feasibility of a feedstock and
the production process combination in a specific geographical loca-
tion. LCA evaluates the impact of biodiesel production and utiliza-
tion cycle on global warming and other possible harmful effects on
human health, depletion of non-renewable resources and net energy
ratio (NER) [132(cid:1)135]. The largest producers and users of biodiesel,
EU and US have setup a list of sustainability requirements for biofuel
production specified by LCA analysis. EU targets require 35% energy
input and emission reduction during fuel production stage by 2009,
which would be 50% in 2017, and 60% from 2018 onward for all new
biofuel plants setup on their D
Xsoil [134,136]. Setting of life cycle emis-
sion reduction targets with respect to mineral diesel at the place of
end use partially helps in providing common basis for comparing
the life cycle efficiency of energy sources irrespective of the effect of
local variations. Interpretation of LCA data for various biodiesel
Xthat use of biodiesel helps in reducing GHG emis-
resources indicatesD
sions and it generally has NER > 1.3.

PRocha et al. [132] assessed the health and environmental impacts
of biodiesel production from soybean and palm oils as well as etha-
nol. Biofuel production with higher agricultural yields and extensive
use of co-products in its life cycle offers best environmental results.
Comparison of large biodiesel production plants (0.12 million liters/
day) from palm and soybean oil revealed higher NER for palm bio-
diesel due to higher production of palm oil per hectare and use of
lower fertilizer quantity. Average NER of biodiesels was 1.31 and
3.25 for soybean and palm biodiesels respectively for various plants.
These NERs improved to 2.88 and 3.89 for soybean and palm biodie-
sels respectively, when energy content of by-products was also
taken into consideration. Despite availability of a multitude of LCA
studies, though not fully updated, it remainsD
X difficult to evaluate,
which feedstock leads to real time favorable NER along with less
environmental impact (GHG, resource input and depletion, impact
on human health). One approach for consistent common systematic
quantitative LCA could be to draw meaningful conclusions from
comparison of different biofuels with corresponding fossil fuels at
global level by involving all stakeholders rather than relying D
Xon indi-
vidual LCA studies. This would entail elaboration of methodologies
for harmonization and updating dataD

measurement of biofuel's sustainability and evaluate environmental
impact over the entire life cycle, starting from raw materials,

time, in order to achieve higher sustainability of biodiesel produc-

3.7. Economic analysis

Xis that D

PIn 2014, prices of natural gas, gasoline, diesel and biodiesel
(B100) were US$ 2.09, US$ 3.34, US$ 3.49, and US$ 4.22 per gallon
energy equivalent respectively [137]. In Germany, price for biodiesel
was »75.60 euro cents per liter (US$ 3.066 per gallon) in October
2015, excluding energy tax. This exceeded the price for agricultural
diesel (i.e., off-road diesel) by nearly 10 euro cents per liter (US$
0.416 per gallon) [138]. The realistic situation D
Xbiodiesel pro-
duction cost without taxes currently is higher than the selling price
Xthe open market
of mineral diesel, which makes it an unviable fuel in D
place, without D
Xsubsidy. Literature shows that cost of feedstock oil
comprises of »80(cid:1)85% of the total biodiesel production cost [139].
Productivity of the base catalyzed transesterification process was
comparatively higher (1.010 kg biodiesel/ kg vegetable oil), than that
of acid catalyzed transesterification process (0.85 - 0.95 kg biodiesel/
kg vegetable oil) [140]. Typical processing cost for base catalyzed
Jatropha biodiesel was reported to be US$ 0.15/L, and for acid cata-
lyzed waste cooking oil was US$ 0.23/L, which excluded D
Xfeedstock
cost [140]. Shirazi et al. [141] estimated biodiesel production cost to
be US$ 1.2/L using base catalyzed transesterification of waste cook-
ing oil. Cost of waste cooking oil was »55% of the total cost of biodie-
sel, making it economically viable fuel. On the other hand, biodiesel
production cost using enzymatic catalysts was US$ 1.8/L, which
makes it economically unviable compared to conventional fuels
[142]. Fig. 6 shows that even in supercritical alcoholysis process for
biodiesel production, »90% cost is accounted for feedstock procure-
ment, »5% production cost is accounted for procurement of alcohol
and »5% production cost is attributed towards the energy used in
the process [143].

PIn 2014, total installed capacity for biodiesel production in EU
was »23 million tons/ year [144]. In a sharp contract, total installed
capacity for biodiesel production in Canada and USA was 0.56 mil-
lion tons /year and 9.2 million tons /year respectively in 2015 [138].
Most of these biodiesel production capacities were underutilized
due to scarcity of feedstock at competitive price. The price of biodie-
sel can compete with fossil fuels only when crude oil price is higher
and biodiesel feedstock prices are lower. With increase in global
the price of major feedstock oils have
biodiesel production,

Pconsiderably increased over the years and this trend will continue,
affecting the biodiesel economics adversely [145]. Currently bio-
diesel is economical in USA only with US$ 1.0/gallon subsidy,
which is provided by the government due to its contributions
Xtowards job creation and carbon emissionD

X reduction.

PBiodiesel as an alternative fuel has been and is the key for many
government policies, research initiatives and investments with
implications on agriculture and developmental economics world-
wide. Production cost of biodiesel from vegetable oils remains the
main barrier to its large-scale replacement of mineral diesel. Hence,
the focus is on process improvements and innovations; and making
the feedstocks available in larger quantities economically for long-
term energy sustainability. In the interim period, animal fat and
waste cooking oils offer an opportunity to reduce biodiesel produc-
tion cost, however their production volumes are far below the
demand for biodiesel. Therefore with limited land resources, it is
important to consider deployment of more productive crops, which
can accrue higher oil yield and can be grown on nutrient deprivedD
X,
fallow and marginal lands.

4. Engine performance and biodiesel compatibility

PInterest of researchers in biodiesel as an alternative to mineral
diesel to operate CI engines is reflected by the large number of
papers published in last couple of decades [146,147]. These studies
reported successful operation of CI engines with biodiesel derived
Xengine performance and emis-
from a host of feedstocks. However D
sion characteristics with respect to mineral diesel varyD
Xconsiderably,
depending on biodiesel properties, biodiesel blend concentration
and engine technology used. Effect of biodiesel on engine perfor-
mance, emissions and combustion characteristics of CI engines, and
their effect on particulate, engine wear and lubricating oil degrada-
tion are reviewed comprehensively in this section.

4.1. Engine performance

PEngine performance is measured in terms of maximum power/
torque generated by the engine at a given speed, BSFC and brake
thermal efficiency (BTE). Maximum torque produced by any fuel at a
given engine speed determines the acceleration characteristics of
the vehicle, which makes a qualitative difference in the driving
experience. BSFC and BTE are the other engine performance parame-
ters, which represent fuel economy and efficiency of conversion of
fuel into useful work/ power output respectively.

P4.1.1. Power output

PMaximum power produced by a diesel engine is dependent on
fuel quantity injected, which can be burned efficiently in the com-
bustion chamber. Due to lower calorific value of biodiesel compared
to mineral diesel, maximum power produced in an unmodified
CI engine operating on biodiesel is slightly lower compared to
mineral diesel. Xiaoming et al. [148] reported that torque output
of B50 fueled engine reduced by »2.6% in the speed range of
1000(cid:1)2400 rpm at full load. Kawano et al. [149] used Rapeseed
methyl ester (RME) to fuel a modern diesel engine equipped with
common rail direct injection (CRDI) system and exhaust gas recircu-
lation (EGR). They reported that both, the torque and power outputs
of RME were inferior to mineral diesel at all engine speeds. Volumet-
ric heating value of RME calculated using fuel density and calorific
value was »8% lower than mineral diesel. Injection of fixed fuel vol-
ume at maximum torque resulted in lower torque and power out-
puts from biodiesel fueled engine [149]. On the other hand, Sinha
and Agarwal [150] reported that maximum torque output of the
transport engine was either equal or slightly higher than mineral
diesel, when rice-bran biodiesel blends in lower concentrations
(B05, B10, and B20) were used. However the torque output
decreased slightly for higher biodiesel blends vis-(cid:1)a-vis mineral die-
sel at lower engine speeds in a DICI engine. At higher speeds, torque
was almost identicalD
Xfor all test fuels. In a EURO-5 compliant vehicle
tested using new European driving cycle (NEDC), lower biodiesel
blends (B7 and B20) delivered lower power and torque output com-
Xat lower engine speeds (Fig. 7). Bio-
pared to baseline mineral dieselD
diesel in this study was produced from Soybean oil (84%) and
Palm oil (16%). For remaining test conditions, B7 exhibited increased
engine power and torque output (by < 1.6%) at the highest engine
speed. This tendency was also exhibited by B20, however onD
Xa lower
magnitude [151]. Fuel distillation characteristics, fuel viscosity and
oxygen content of biodiesel affected the combustion and heat
release rate (HRR), which improved the power and torque character-
istics of the test engine, particularly at high engine speeds as seen in
Fig. 7 [151].

PDhar and Agarwal [152] also reported approximately 0%, 0.7% and
Xfor lower Karanja biodiesel blends (B05, B10 and
0.3% higher torque D
B20) compared to mineral diesel (Fig. 8) however torque D
Xreduced by
1.4% and 2.1% for higher biodiesel blend (B50) and B100 respectively.
There are numerous studies in the literature (Table 7), which suggest
slight increase/ equal/ slight decrease in power output however
for all practical purposes, the variations are small enough to be
neglected and can be easily adjusted by engine tuning.

PBrake power output/ torque generated by engines fuelled by bio-
diesel produced from different feedstocks is reportedly lower than

[152], with permission of Elsevier).

Pbaseline mineral diesel, barring few exceptions. This is mainly attrib-
uted to relatively lower calorific value of biodiesel despite its higher
density. Inspite of mixed results of brake power/torque output from
various studies, overall engine performance differences D

gible, when D
Xincreased with increasing biodiesel blending ratio.
These differences D
This emphasizedD
X the need to optimize biodiesel blending ratio in
order to achieve either comparable or slightly enhanced engine per-
formance, in comparison to baseline mineral diesel, which could be
achieved easily by tuning/recalibration of the fuel injection equip-
ment of the engine. Therefore, it is not a serious issue to be consid-
ered in large-scale implementation of biodiesel in transportation
sector.

P4.1.2. Brake specific fuel consumption

PBSFC is the ratio of mass of the fuel consumed to the brake power
produced by the engine. Higher BTE results in lower BSFC and lower
calorific value of fuel increases the BSFC. Most studies in open litera-
ture reported increased BSFC in case of biodiesel fuelled engines vis-
(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel fuelled engines. Alam et al. [162], Qi et al. [159],
Usta et al. [160], and Canakci and Van Gerpen [163] reported that
higher biodiesel quantity was required to release an equivalent
amount of heat in the combustion chamber due to higher density
but lower calorific value of biodiesel in comparison to baseline min-
eral diesel. No significant difference between BSFC of the engine
operating with B20 and mineral diesel was observed D
X[163]. Lin et al.
[164] compared the BSFC of Soybean biodiesel produced using and

Pwithout using peroxidation process vis-(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel. Biodie-
sel produced using peroxidation process was found to have higher
oxygen content and higher number of saturated carbon-to-carbon
bonds. Peroxidation process however reduced the calorific value and
cetane number of biodiesel. BSFC of both biodiesels produced with
and without peroxidation process were higher than mineral diesel
in the reverse order of calorific value [164]. Corgard and Reitz [165]
reported similar BSFC for biodiesel and mineral diesel. Zhu et al.
[166] reported higher BSFC for methanol and ethanol blended bio-
diesel D
Xcompared to waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) alone, while
BSFC of biodiesel-methanol blends was higher than corresponding
biodiesel-ethanol blends. Raheman and Ghadge [167] found that
BSFC and exhaust gas temperature increased with increasing pro-
portion of Mahua oil biodiesel in the blends in an indirect-injection
(IDI) engine with compression ratio (CR) ranging from 18:1 to 20:1.
Increasing the CR led to reduction in BSFC for both test fuels, how-
ever increasing CR showed greater benefits for biodiesel compared
to baseline mineral diesel [167]. Biodiesel's performance was rela-
tively superior at higher CRD
Xdue to its relatively lower volatility and
higher viscosity [167].

PWhile these studies discussed earlier conclusive proved higher
BSFC in case of biodiesel fueled engines, however there was another
set of studies also, which reported lower BSFC in case of biodiesel
fueled engines vis-(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel fueled engines. Utsa D
X[158]
reported that BSFC of biodiesel (TSOME) blends were slightly lower
than mineral diesel at full load, while they were slightly higher than
mineral diesel at part loads. Comparison of fuel consumption for die-
sel, pure plant rapeseed oil (PPO) and 5% blend of rapeseed biodiesel
in a CRDI engine showed (Fig. 9) that lower biodiesel blend resulted
in reduction in BSFC, inspite of lower calorific value of biodiesel
[168].

PThere are numerous experimental studies using different biodie-
sels, some of which are summarized in Table 8. Most of the engines
fuelled with biodiesel showed increased BSFC however there are

Psome exceptions, wherein lower BSFC of biodiesel in comparison to
mineral diesel is also reported.

PThis trend in BSFC is primarily a result of lower calorific value,
higher viscosity and density of biodiesels (feedstock and production
process influenced), fuel injection pressure (FIP) and fuel injection
technology used. Lower biodiesel blends improved BSFC in some

these studies that BSFC of biodiesels and blends is generally slightly

employed in the engine to a great extent.

P4.1.3. Brake thermal efficiency

PBTE is the ratio of useful work produced by an engine to the
energy input by the fuel. BTE provides a rational basis for comparing
the performance of test fuels having different calorific values. Most
publications reported higher BTE for biodiesel compared to mineral
diesel. Mahanta et al. [173] reported higher BTE for B20 compared to
mineral diesel. Researchers suggested that the oxygen content of
biodiesel was more effective in improving fuel rich combustion
[159]. Agarwal and Das [178] tested all blends of biodiesel (Diesel,
B5, B10, B15, B20, B25, B30, B40, B50, B75 and B100) (Fig. 10) and
reported that 20% biodiesel (Linseed oil methyl ester) blend was the
optimum biodiesel blend, which improved peak thermal efficiency
of the engine by 2.5% compared to baseline mineral diesel in a single
cylinder CI engine (Fig. 11).

PSuryawanshi and Deshpande [179] reported slightly higher BTE
for Pongamia oil biodiesel blends compared to mineral diesel and
reported that retarding injection timing by 4° crank angle resulted

Pin minor improvement in BTE at part loads however no change was
observed at full load. Grimaldi et al. [155] also reported slightly
higher BTE in case of biodiesel, particularly at high load compared to
mineral diesel. At lower speeds and loads, biodiesel's BTE was
reportedly lower than mineral diesel in this study and this was
attributed to relatively inferior vaporization characteristics of bio-
diesel at lower in-cylinder temperatures [155]. Zhu et al. [166]
reported that oxygenated test fuels, namely biodiesel, biodiesel-eth-
anol blends and biodiesel-methanol blends gave superior BTE at all
operating conditions vis-(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel. Researchers concluded
that small amount of alcohol in the blend was favorable for reducing
the viscosity and density of the test fuel, which improved spray
atomization, leading to improved combustion. While in case of
blended fuels containing higher percentage of alcohol, cooling effect
due to higher latent heat of vaporization of alcohols was a dominant
factor, which lowered the BTE [166].

PIn addition to these studies, there are a smaller number of
researchers, who have reported almost similar or lower BTE for bio-
diesel compared to mineral diesel. Thermal efficiency of TSOME
blends was reportedly lower than mineral diesel at part loads how-
ever it was higher than mineral diesel at full load [158]. Qi et al.
[159] and Canakci [163,174] reported almost similar BTE for soybean
biodiesel and mineral diesel. Prabhahar et al. [175] also reported
lower BTE for Karanja biodiesel and blends compared to mineral die-
sel. Raheman and Ghadge [167] reported that BTE decreased with
increasing proportion of biodiesel in the test blends for all investi-
gated CRs (18:1(cid:1)20:1) in D
Xthe IDI engine. There are numerous
Xexperimental studies, whose results are summarized in D

XTable 9.

PHigher BTE of biodiesel blends with mineral diesel is a function of
blending ratio, fuel oxygen content, fuel viscosity and density. Fuel
oxygen content can be further improved by adding a small fraction
of alcohol. BTE of biodiesels and blends can also be improved by
employing higher FIP, which improves the spray atomization and
vaporization of biodiesel droplets, thus offsetting its higher viscosity
and density effects. In general, 20% (v/v) biodiesel blended with min-
eral diesel seem to deliver optimal BTE. From these studies, it can be
summarized that biodiesel derived from different feedstocks and
their blends with mineral diesel and/ or alcohols can deliver slightly
higher BTE than baseline mineral diesel, except very few studies,
which showed lower BTE of biodiesel. Nevertheless, engine perfor-
mance of biodiesels is conclusively comparable to mineral diesel.

4.2. Emissions

PMajor pollutants of concern emanating from CI engine are NOx
and PM due to their trade-off and ever shrinking limits D
Xbeing
adopted for these pollutants in newer emission legislations. This sec-
tion reviews the effect of biodiesel on CO, HC, NOx and PM emissions
including particulate number (PN) from biodiesel fuelled engines.
Emission legislations for the engines are becoming more and more
stringent worldwide. For heavy-duty vehicles, NOx limits have been
tightened from 5.0 g/kWh to 3.5 g/kWh from Euro-III to Euro-IV
emission legislations. Similarly, for passenger cars and light com-
mercial vehicles (LCV), NOx limit has been reduced from 0.5 g/km to
0.25 g/km from Euro-III to Euro-IV emission legislations [184]. In
EURO-V legislations, these limits for NOx and PM are further reduced
to 0.18 and 0.005 g/km respectively [185]. With implementation of
EURO-V and EURO-VI emission legislations, limits on PN concentra-
tion (6.0 £1011 #/km) in addition to particulate mass would come
into force [185].

PFamous historical EPA review study [186] of 2002 showed that
Xslightly increased,
emissions of HC, CO and PM reduced but NOx D
when biodiesel blend concentration was increased. Results for these

the results from this 2002 EPA study. EPA study results are shown by

PResults from HD/ MD engine and chassis dynamometer tests

and it was found that biodiesel from all feedstocks gave substantial

sions, these reductions were negligible D
sion characteristics of biodiesel fueled engine varied with feedstock
due to differences in chemical and physical properties of biodiesels,
especially the carbon chain lengths of the alkyl esters.

was a general trend revealed by this study [186].

Pof RME and mineral diesel. CO emission from RME was slightly
higher at low loads however they decreased with increasing engine
load.

PEffect of mixing alcohol in biodiesel blends on CO emission
depends on engine operating conditions. Zhu et al. [166] reported
that biodiesel-alcohol blends with 10% or 15% alcohol content pro-
duced higher BSCO emission at light and medium loads but similar
BSCO emission at high loads compared to baseline mineral diesel.
For 5% alcohol blends, BSCO emissions were lower than biodiesel at
all engine operating conditions [166]. Mixing of alcohols in biodiesel
increased the oxygen content of the test fuel, since alcohols have
higher oxygen content (w/w) than biodiesel, which resulted in
reduction in CO emission. Shi et al. [201] reported that changes in
CO emission from ethanol: methyl soyate: diesel (5:20:75) blend in
comparison to baseline mineral diesel were not conclusive and they

observed decreasing CO emissionD

with increasing FIP in a single cylinder, air-cooled, DI engine. Kou-
soulidou et al. [202] reported that biodiesel didn't have any signifi-
cant effect on CO emission vis-(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel in an engine
equipped with CRDI system. In European test cycle, overall CO emis-
sion of B5 was 2.9% higher for one vehicle and slightly higher for
another vehicle equipped with CRDI system in comparison to min-
eral diesel [168]. A noticeable increase in CO emission at low load
was noticed for B30 and B100 of different feedstocks in comparison
to baseline mineral diesel [203]. Engines fitted with CRDI fuel injec-
tion system didn't show any significant change in CO emission in
most experimental studies. However engines fitted with other types
of fuel injection equipment having relatively lower FIP generally
showed lower CO emissionD

hydrocarbon species, which are a part of THC emission, they are
unregulated emissions, D

The review study by EPA (2002) dealing with impact of biodiesel on
pollutants from heavy-duty CI engines without EGR and after-treat-
ment system indicated 65% and 21% reduction in THC emissions by
B100 and B20 respectively as a general trend [186]. Qi et al. [159]

There are few other interesting studies related to THC emissions,
which are discussed individually. Suryawanshi et al. [179] reported
significant reduction in THC emissions from Pongamia methyl ester
blends compared to mineral diesel at part loads as well as full load.
THC emissions further reduced by 31.8% at lower loads for B100 at
retarded injection timings compared to B100 at standard injection
timing [179]. Grimaldi et al. [155] observed substantial reduction in

PGrimaldi et al. [155] reported comparable brake specific CO

CO emission from 20% WCOB at all speeds however at lower engine

reported higher CO emission from biodiesel blends compared to
mineral diesel in 1500 - 2200 rpm engine speeds at 75% and 100%
loads, but reverse trend of relatively lower CO emission was seen at
higher engine speeds. Authors suggested that fuel-air mixing was
affected by difficulty in atomization of test fuels due to higher vis-
cosity of biodiesel, which resulted in formation of fuel-rich regions
that caused increased CO emission at low engine speeds [160]. Spes-
Xwas quite similar in case

PTHC emissions for biodiesel. At medium loads (λ D 2¡3), B100
reduced THC emissions by »50%. However, they D
Xindicated towards
condensation of THC in the flame ionization detector (FID) analyzer,
which was maintained at 191 °C because the boiling range of
unburned biodiesel was ~300(cid:1)350 °C. This condensation resulted in
recording of lower than actual THC emissions by the FID analyzer
[155].

PZhu et al. [166] observed 30- 59% reduction in THC emissions
from biodiesel vis-(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel, depending on the engine
load. Addition of 5% alcohol (methanol/ ethanol) to biodiesel further
reduced THC emissions by »9%. THC formation is attributed to air-
fuel mixtures that are too lean to auto-ignite or to support a propa-
gating flame or D
Xair-fuel mixtures that are too rich to auto-ignite
[198,210]. Higher oxygen content and cetane number of biodiesel
promoted more complete combustion, which resulted in lower THC
emissions [198]. Gumus et al. [182] reported that THC emissions
decreased with increasing biodiesel concentration in the test fuel D
Xas
well as with increasing FIP (Fig. 15).

PSinha et al. [150] reported that THC emissions were higher for
lower rice-bran oil biodiesel blends (B5, B10, and B20) compared to
mineral diesel, and were highest for B10, although the absolute val-
ues were close to being negligible. For higher biodiesel blends, THC
emissions were in the same range as mineral diesel (Fig. 16).

PKousoulidou et al. [202] compared THC emissions from palm bio-
diesel and RME with mineral diesel in an engine equipped with CRDI

[182], with permission of Elsevier).

Pfuel injection system. For palm biodiesel and RME, THC emissions
increased by 40% and 15% respectively in comparison to mineral
diesel [202]. In European test cycle, overall THC emissions from B5
were slightly higher for one vehicle but slightly lower at higher
speeds for other vehicle equipped with CRDI D
Xsystem compared to
baseline mineral diesel [204]. A noticeable increase in THC emissions
at low load was seen from B30 and B100 of different feedstocks com-
pared to baseline mineral diesel [205]. In another study using CRDI
engine, THC and CO emissions from B100 were slightly lower than
mineral diesel under most operating conditions. EGR increased THC
and CO emissions however effectively reduced NOx emissions.
Increasing the FIP also reduced the THC and CO emissions from both
fuels [211]. Mikulski et al. [169] analyzed animal-fat based biodiesel
namely swine lard methyl esters (SLME) blends (B25, B50 and B75)
and mineral diesel in a modern CRDI high speed engine. An average
52% reduction of THC emissions was observed [169]. Lower calorific
value of test fuel requires a larger fuel quantity of biofuel to be
injected in the cylinder under identical operating conditions.
Increase of biodiesel percentage in test fuel reduces the ignition
delay though. In addition, presence of molecular oxygen in biodiesel
improves combustion of the test fuel [169]. C(cid:3)ardenas et al. tested
three biodiesels (derived from rapeseed, sunflower and soybean
oils) and their blends (30% v/v) with mineral diesel in a 4-cylinder
CRDI engine under NEDC. Biodiesels and blends produced higher
brake specific THC emissions in comparison with the reference fuel.
Most important reason for these trends was the impact of fuel prop-
erties on the electronic control unit (ECU) response, which was
tuned for diesel operation [212]. After ECU recalibration, it was
Xpossible to achieve lower THC emissions.

PTHC emissions reduced when 100% biodiesel was used instead
Xmineral diesel. THC emissions reduced with increasing biodie-
of D
sel blend ratioD
X. THC emissions are influenced by feedstock and
fuel properties such as oxygen content and cetane number,
which are affected by different chain lengths and saturation level
of biodiesels. Addition of small fraction of alcohol to biodiesel
X THC emissions. Engine operating parame-
blends further reducedD
ters such as increased FIP, retarded fuel injection timings etc.
also reduced THC emissions. General trend suggests that usage
of biodiesel and blends lead to substantial reduction in THC and
CO emissions in lower FIP engines however this advantage of
lower CO and THC emissions is rather limited D
Xin modern CRDI
engines, which operate at relatively higher FIP. CRDI engines are
ECU controlled engines and can be extensively optimized for the
test fuel properties. Hence it is essential to recalibrate the ECU
for improving the emission advantage of biodiesel and its blends
vis-(cid:1)a-vis baseline mineral diesel.

P4.2.3. NOx emissions

PNOx formation in CI engines is dependent on peak in-cylinder
temperature and duration of this high temperature (above 1700 K)
environment in the combustion cycle, chemical structure of the
fuels, and availability of oxygen in the high temperature zones. With
addition of biodiesel to mineral diesel, physical parameters such as
duration of high temperature window in the combustion chamber,
concentration of oxygen in the high temperature combustion zones
along with chemical composition of burning mixture also changes.
In a review study, Lapuerta et al. [146] summarized four different
types of effects of biodiesel on NOx emissions, ranging from
increased NOx emissions to reucedD
XNOx emissions by biodiesel fuel-
ing, at all operating points. However majority of papers on biodiesel
emission characteristics reported increased NOx emissions with bio-
diesel from essentially unmodified engines [146,213]. Usta D
X[158]
reported that at part loads, NOx emissions D
Xfrom B20 were similar to
mineral diesel. NOx increased slightly due to increased combustion
chamber temperature and presence of fuel oxygen [158,214]. Alam
et al. [162] reported that BSNOx emissions decreased with increas-
ing engine load for all test fuels however biodiesel blends emitted
higher NOx D
Xcompared to baseline mineral diesel. They suggested
that increased NOx emissions were due to relatively earlier start of
fuel injection in biodiesel blends compared to mineral diesel, pri-
marily due to differences in bulk modulus of compressibility [162].
There are numerous other studies in the open literature, which areD
summarized in Table 12 to show the effect of different biodiesels on
NOx emissions compared to mineral diesel.

PThere are generally two diverse results from the experiments
concerning NOx emissions from biodiesel. One group of experiments
suggests relatively higher NOx emissions from biodiesel and the
other group of experiments suggests relatively lower NOx emissions
compared to baseline mineral diesel. Increase in NOx emissions are
still not very well explained, but several influencing parameters,
such as fuel type and quality, fuel spray characteristics, operating
conditions, and engine technology are some of the possible reasons.
NOx emissions depend strongly on the equivalence ratio, oxygen
concentration and burned gas temperature; and they increase, when
biodiesel and blends are used. This increase is mainly due to higher
oxygen content of D
Xbiodiesel/blends, resulting in a charge gas compo-
sitionD
X closer to stoichiometric (less rich) in the flame zone. More-
over, cetane number and different injection characteristics also have
an impact on NOx emissions from biodiesel/ blends. The content of
unsaturated compounds in biodiesel can have a greater impact on

PNOx emissions. In modern high speed diesel engines, use of biodiesel
results in more advanced and faster overall combustion event, which
leads to elevated in-cylinder temperatures and increased NOx
formation. They also exhibit other NOx effects either positive or
negative, depending on response of engine control systems to fuel
property changes, such as D
Xrelatively lower energy content of biodie-
sel compared to mineral diesel.

PThere are few other studies covering different aspects of NOx
emissions from biodiesel fueled engines, which are covered individ-
ually. Suryawanshi et al. [179] reported higher NOx emissions from
Pongamia biodiesel compared to mineral diesel. Retarding the start
of injection (SOI) by 4° CA resulted in reduction in NOx emissions
however NOx levels still remained higher than mineral diesel. Sharp
et al. [216] reported that use of Soy biodiesel resulted in 10%
increase in NOx emissions in a 6-cylinder, 14 L, turbocharged, inter-
cooled, ECU controlled DI engine. Their investigations of correlation
between NOx emissions and fuel properties showed that NOx emis-
sions decreased with increasing fuel oxygen content D
Xof the test fuels
and it increased with increasing carbon chain length (Fig. 17) [216].
H/C ratio and NOx emissions showed good correlation with a

PNOx emissions increase significantly for B100 and this increase
varies with biodiesel feedstock. Unsaturated biodiesel (higher iodine
value) produced relatively higher NOx emissions in an electronic
unit injector equipped engine. In engine equipped with CRDI D
Xsystem,
the effect of biodiesel unsaturation was relatively lower compared to
engine equipped with unit injector. This suggests that higher bulk
modulus of compressibility of biodiesel is not the only reason for
increased NOx emissions from biodiesel [217]. Cetane improver
additives in biodiesel had no effect on NOx D
Xemissions from any of
the two engines. This suggested that NOx emissions were not depen-
dent on the cetane number of the fuel either [217]. AL-Shemmeri
et al. [218] reported linear relationship between adiabatic flame
temperature and NOx emissions from different biodiesel blends.
McGill et al. [219] reported increased NOx emissions fromD
X100% bio-
diesel and blends at most operating conditions except some operat-
ing points at high speed and low load in comparison to mineral
in a DI engine equipped with electronically controlled
diesel
mechanical fuel pump. Gumus et al. [182] reported that NOx emis-
sions increased with increasing engine load due to higher peak com-
bustion chamber temperature. NOx emissions increased with
increasing biodiesel concentration in the test fuel. NOx emissions
generally decreased with increasing FIP however the trend was not
regular and significant (Fig. 19a-b) [182].
PWang et al. [198] tested nine vehicles D

Xusing B35 and mineral die-
sel. They reported that differences in NOx emissions from B35 and
diesel fueled engine were insignificant [198]. ParticulateD
X increased
and NOx emissions decreased in a CI engine, when SoI timings were
retarded [220]. Szybist et al. [221] also reported reduction in NOx
emissions from biodiesel fueled engine by retarding the SoI timings.
Yehliu et al. [176] reported that split injection reduced NOx emis-
sions from both fuels but higher reduction was observed in case of
B100 fueled engine, which showed 18% lower NOx compared to
mineral diesel [176]. At all engine loads, an increase in FIP signifi-
cantly increased NOx emissions from ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD)
and Soybean methyl ester (SME) biodiesel (B40) in a CRDI engine
[222]. Significant NOx emissionD
Xreduction and a considerable smoke
Xof different feedstocks in
reduction was observed for B30 and B100 D
an engine fitted with CRDI system and an ECU with closed-loop com-
bustion control [203]. Hwang et al. [223] showed that difference in
NOx emissions from B100 and mineral diesel were insignificant at
higher FIP (1600 bar) however at lower FIP, biodiesel emitted signifi-
cantly higher NOx emissions. In modern ECU controlled engines,
control parameters need to be re-optimized with changing fuel
properties such as addition of biodiesel in mineral diesel. Anand
et al. [224] reported »37.3% reduction in NO emissions with addition

XcomparedD

Pof 10% methanol in Karanja biodiesel at full load. Zhu et al. [166]
reported that BSNOx emissions from methanol/ ethanol-biodiesel
blends were lower than mineral diesel and these emissions further
decreased with increasing alcohol concentration in the test fuel. For
the methanol/ ethanol-biodiesel blends, the mixture cooling effect
of alcohols due to their higher latent heat of vaporization and rela-
tively lower heating value reduced the peak combustion tempera-
ture hence the NOx emissions [166]. Lin et al. [164] suggested that
NOx emissions from biodiesel were higher than mineral diesel but
biodiesel produced by peroxidation process emitted lower NOx
emissions than mineral diesel even though it has higher oxygen con-
tent than mineral diesel. This indicated that formation of NOx is
Xthe oxygen
probably more sensitive to biodiesel unsaturation than D
content of the test fuel. Yoon et al. [225] reported lower NOx emis-
sions from ethanol-biodiesel blends D
Xto mineral diesel for
all test conditions due to higher latent heat of vaporization of etha-
nol and double injection strategy, which suppressed increase in
peak combustion temperature and pressure. Szybist et al. [226]
reduced the iodine value of Soybean biodiesel by increasing the con-
centration of methyl oleate (methyl ester of oleic acid). There was
no increase in NOx emissions from Soybean biodiesel (B20) contain-
ing 76% methyl oleate, while ordinary Soybean biodiesel (B20) emit-
ted 3(cid:1)5% higher NOx D
Xcompared to mineral diesel [226]. They
concluded that NOx emissions were insensitive to cetane number
[226]. A literature review on the effect of cetane number on NOx
emissions concluded that NOx emissions generally decreased with
increasing cetane number [227]. Many studies suggested that higher
oxygen content of biodiesel is the main reason for higher NOx emis-
sions but Lapuerta et al. [228] suggested that the oxygen content of
biodiesel does not cause any increase in NO formation because diffu-
sion combustion occurs mainly in regions with oxygen-fuel ratio
around stoichiometric (2.81 for biodiesel and 3.58 for diesel). Fuel
bound oxygen is not enough to compensate for such a difference.
One study conducted on after-treatment of NOx emission by Sharma
et al. [229] concluded that the effectiveness of Urea-SCR system in
reducing NOx emissions from biodiesel (B20) was comparable to
baseline mineral diesel.

PMueller et al. [230] suggested that NOx increase from biodiesel
fuelled engines can't be quantitatively determined by a change in
a single fuel property. Rather it is a result of a number of coupled
mechanisms, whose effects reinforces or cancels one another under
different conditions, depending on specific combustion and fuel char-
acteristics. Fuel-air mixtures closer to stoichiometric at the time of
Xpremixed auto-ignition zone near the flame lift-
ignition and in the D
Xemissions
off length appear to be a key factorD

X in helping more NOx D

Pfrom biodiesel fuelled engine under all conditions. These differences
are expected to encourage higher local and higher average in-
cylinder temperatures, lower radiative heat losses, and shorter and
more-advanced combustion event. All these factors increase thermal
NOx emissions. Differences in prompt NO formation and species con-
centrations resulting from fuel and jet-structure changes also play
important role in higher NOx formation from biodiesel.

P4.2.4. Particulate emissions

PDiesel engines are known for emitting carbonaceous particles,
known as particulate matter (PM). PM comprises of carbon core
with several organic compounds, nitrates, sulfates, metals and irri-
tants (such as acrolein, ammonia, acids, fuel vapors, unburnt lubri-
cants oils) adsorbed on to its surface [231]. These D
Xparticles mainly
originate from incomplete combustion of fuel, lubricating oil and
engine wear. Typical composition of PM is shown in Fig. 20 [7].

PThe particle size-number distribution and chemical composition
varies greatly, depending on engine type, engine speed, fuel compo-
sition, lubricating oil formulation, and emission control technology
employed in the engine [232]. Diesel PM are respirable and have a

lent carrier for adsorbed inorganic and organic compounds [233].
Many of these adsorbed species are known to be toxic, mutagenic
and carcinogenic [233].

diesel fuelling of CRDI engnies [235(cid:1)236]. Lapuerta et al. [237]

PDiesel PM exists in two distinct submicron modes: nuclei-mode
(7.5 to 56 nm) and accumulation mode (56 to 1000 nm) [253]. Accu-
mulation-mode particles are chain agglomerates of primary carbon
spheres and sulfates with adsorbed hydrocarbons. Nuclei mode par-
ticles are composed of elemental carbon (EC) and condensed organic
carbon (OC) fractions. Several studies have indicated that higher fuel
sulfur content results in higher nuclei-mode particle formation
[254,255]. Generally, it is observed that addition of biodiesel in min-
eral diesel results in reduction D

PZhu et al. [256] conducted experiments using ULSD (< 1 ppm Sul-
phur) and two biodiesels blended with baseline mineral diesel
(400 ppm Sulphur) using a direct injection diesel engine (Cummins).
It was reported that with increasing proportion of biodiesel in the
test blends, smoke opacity decreased, while total particle number
concentrations increased [256]. ULSD also showed relatively lower
smoke opacity and total PN concentration D
Xcompared to baseline
mineral diesel. In comparison to baseline mineral diesel, total nucle-
ation mode particle number concentration was higher in case of bio-
diesel blends, and relatively lower in case of ULSD [256]. Tan et al.
[257] reported that the number of nucleation mode particles at peak
(6 to 16 nm) increased with increasing blending ratio of Jatropha
biodiesel in a CRDI engine. However, there was reduction in accumu-
lation mode particles at peak (30 to 61 nm) at most engine operating
conditions [257]. Higher nucleation mode particulate formation was
explained by three mechanisms, including super-saturation leading
to formation of new particles by nucleation, increased SOF due to
higher viscosity and lower volatility of biodiesel, and higher oxygen
content of biodiesel causing carbonaceous particles to change from
fine to ultrafine/ nano-particle sizes [257]. Di et al. [258] reported
that with increasing oxygen content of the blends of diglyme (DGM)
with ULSD, smoke opacity, PM mass emission, and geometric mean
diameter of particles decreased. PN for sizes less than 100 nm and
total particle numbers increased for diesel-DGM blend compared to
baseline ULSD [258]. Zhang et al. [259] reported lower particle num-
ber emissions with no nucleation mode particles for B100 from a
CRDI engine fueled with biodiesel blends. It was concluded that
lower sulfur content of biodiesel (64 ppm) in comparison to mineral
diesel (1135 ppm) was responsible for this absence of nucleation
mode particles [259]. Sinha et al. [260] reported that the PN density
increased and particulate mass decreased with increasing percent-
age of soybean biodiesel in test blend with ULSD. B100 reduced the
accumulation mode particle numbers and produced higher nucle-
ation mode particles compared to ULSD at higher FIP [260]. Higher
nucleation mode particle formation was assumed to be because of
higher SOF [260].

PAgarwal et al. [261] conducted an experimental study to find par-
ticulate size-number distribution from B20 and B100 and they com-
pared it with baseline mineral diesel fueled engine at different
engine loads. In this study, B20 gave highest particle number con-
centration at no load however at most loads, higher number of
smaller particles were emitted by B100 compared to baseline min-
eral diesel. They also reported that emission of particles of all size

ranges was D
experimental conditions [261].

PSeveral researchers studied the effect of fuel injection parameters
and strategies on particulate number-size distribution using single
cylinder research engine and reported that particulate number-size
distribution reduced with increasing FIP [262,263]. Total PN emitted
by Karanja biodiesel blends were lower than mineral diesel [256].
Agarwal et al. [263] reported lowest PN emitted by 10% Karanja bio-
diesel blend. Dhar and Agarwal [264] reported that total PN concen-
tration emitted by B20 and B50 were lower than baseline mineral
diesel. Particulate number-size distribution lowered with increasing
FIP. At fixed pilot injection timing, particulate number-size distribu-
tion increased with retarded main injection for all test fuels [264].

PThere were some experimental studies looking at the response of
exhaust gas after-treatment systems with biodiesel and blends,
compared to baseline mineral diesel. Some of these studies are dis-
cussed here. In one such study, Lower nuclei mode particle numbers
were emitted downstream of diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) for
both fresh cooking oil (FCO) and WCOB100 compared to baseline
diesel. High proportion of liquid aerosol particles formed in the
engine combustion chamber were eliminated by DOC and the pres-
ence of fuel oxygen in FCO and WCOB100 also helped reduce partic-
ulate emissions [236]. Vertin et al. [265] performed experiments
using a medium-duty truck engine having DOC followed by a cordi-
erite wall-flow type diesel particulate filter (DPF) D
Xusing ULSD and
20% Soy biodiesel (B20). They reported that PM emissions reduced
by 22(cid:1)35% for B20 in the transient test cycle however no PM reduc-
tion was observed in steady-state test-cycle D
X[265]. There were no
statistical differences in post-DPF particulate emissions for B20 and
ULSD [265].

PPositive or adverse effects of biodiesel and blends on PM emis-
sions vary significantly amongst vehicles, engine technology, and
test cycles. These are mainly attributed to certain physico-chemical
properties of biodiesel and D

Xin cold-start conditions.

P4.2.5. Unregulated emissions

PFatty acids methyl esters (FAME) of biodiesels are chemically
more reactive than hydrocarbon molecules of mineral diesel. This
Xhigher number of pollutant spe-
leads to possibility of formation of D
cies in the combustion chamber of a biodiesel fueled engine. Many
of these pollutant species are unregulated and have severe health
effects. There are very few scientific studies in literature dealing
with unregulated emissions from biodiesel [191,266(cid:1)268]. Unregu-
lated emission species in the engine exhaust may contain wide range
of organic compound families such as alkanes, aldehydes, alcohols,
ketones, aromatic and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene,
toluene and xylene (BTX) etc. It is extremely important to under-
stand and evaluate the possible harmful health effects of these spe-
cies on the human health and the environment [269] and this is an
area where D
Xsignificant quantum of research needs to be done. Aro-
matics and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons are highly toxic and can
Xhave mutagenic effects. Use of biodiesel based on methyl esters has
negligible effect on emission of unregulated emission species
namely acrolein, propanol and acetone compared to baseline diesel.
However use of biodiesel based on ethyl esters leads to increased
emission of unregulated species such as acetaldehydeD
X, acrolein,
propanol and acetone; and to a lesser extent, formaldehyde com-
pared to baseline diesel [270].

products from hydrocarbon fuels. Aldehyde emissions reduced by

the same study, Aldehyde emissions reduced by »50% for B100 and

trolled engine using pump-line-nozzle (PLN) fuel injection system
[271]. Three-quarters of total aldehyde emissions on mass basis
comprise of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein, and the
remaining are heavier aldehydes [271]. Karavalakis et al. [272]

this difference at low load condition was not apparent [219]. Karava-
lakis et al. [273] tested five test fuels, B5 and B10 of SME and animal
fat (AFME) and compared them with baseline ULSD in a high speed
CRDI Cummins engine and a Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC)
engine. Emissions tests were conducted as per Federal Test Proce-
dure (FTP), Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), and Sup-
plemental Emissions Test
cycles. They reported that
(SET)
formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the predominant aldehydes in
the exhaust, and the carbonyl emissions were not significantly
affected by biodiesel feedstock [273].

PBallesters et al. [269] investigated regulated and unregulated
emissions from a 4-cylinder, turbocharged, intercooled, CRDI 2.2 L
diesel engine in urban mode and extra-urban mode cycles, repre-
senting European Transient Cycle (ETC), while using low Sulphur
diesel (LSD), and sunflower oil biodiesel blends (B30 and B70). They
reported that carbonyl emissions (aldehydes and ketones) increased
with increasing biodiesel content in the test fuel, while paraffins
(linked or branched alkanes) and aromatic compounds were
detected only in the D
XLSD and B30 because paraffins and aromatics
are present only in reference fuels and absent in biodiesel [269].
Increase in formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions was reported
in a Euro-V CI engine using biodiesel. Formaldehyde and acetalde-
hyde emissions were relatively higher in biodiesel-ethanol blends
compared to baseline diesel [274]. Catalytic converters reduced

reduced unregulated emissions from CI engines significantly [274].
WCOB and blends (having 2, 4, 6 and 8% oxygen w/w) with ULSD
showed lower emissions of formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, toluene,
xylene, but higher emission of acetaldehyde and benzene compared
to baseline ULSD [266]. Formaldehyde emissions increased with
increasing engine load and decreased with increasing biodiesel con-
tent in the test fuel [266]. Gupta and Agarwal [267] reported higher
formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions at lower engine loads
due to lower in-cylinder temperatures and leaner fuel-air mixture
strength regions D
Xin a 2.2 L CRDI engine (Fig. 22). These emissions
decreased with increasing engine load, and speed. Karanja biodiesel
blend (KB20) emitted lower unregulated emissions compared to
baseline mineral diesel [267].

PKrahl et al. [191] detected aromatic D

low loads. Unsaturated hydrocarbons, ethene, ethylene and propene
concentrations were also lower for RME compared to baseline diesel

reduced with use of biodiesel, independent of feedstock [272].

methane emission increased at higher loads [275].

Pare of greater importance as some pollutant species are toxic, muta-
genic, and even carcinogenic to the humans. Carbonyl compounds
also play a critical role to the troposphere chemistry, as they are
important precursors for the formation of free radicals (HOx), ozone,

4.3. Combustion characteristics

PEngine combustion characteristics of a test fuel are investigated
using analysis of cylinder pressure-crank angle history. Combustion
analysis is helpful in understanding the effect of fuel properties on
engine performance and engine-out emissions. Several studies were
reviewed to understand the effect of biodiesel on in-cylinder pres-
sure, HRR, ignition delay, and combustion duration compared to
baseline mineral diesel. Properties of test fuels used in these investi-
gations along with the effect of biodiesel on the combustion charac-
teristics are also discussed and an attempt has been made to find
general trends.

PGumus investigated combustion characteristics of Hazelnut bio-
diesel, which had lower calorific value, and higher viscosity, density
and cetane number compared to mineral diesel [276]. Combustion
started earlier with increased biodiesel concentration in the test
fuel, due to shortening of injection delay because of biodiesel's
higher cetane number. Peak cylinder pressure decreased with
increasing biodiesel concentration in the test fuel but it increased
increasing engine load and
with advancing SOI,
increasing CR. While increasing D
Xbiodiesel content in the test fuel
decreased HRR; advancing SoI, increasing FIP and CR increased the
HRR from biodiesel and blends vis-(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel and led to
significant improvementD
PXiaoming et al.

[148] compared combustion characteristics

PCV: 42 MJ/m3). Peak cylinder pressure for biodiesel was lower than
mineral diesel at all operating conditions except lower engine speed
and high load combinations [148]. Measured values of fuel line pres-
sure showed advanced rise in fuel pressure and slightly higher maxi-
mum fuel line pressure in biodiesel compared to mineral diesel,
which suggested advanced injection of biodiesel compared to min-
eral diesel
injection system
equipped engine. Ignition delay was also shorter in case of biodiesel.
Kwano et al. [149] compared the combustion characteristics such as
in-cylinder pressure, HRR and needle lift for RME (density: 883 g/cc;
cetane number: 52.8; CV: 36.9 MJ/m3; viscosity: 4.31 cSt) and min-
eral diesel (density: 822 g/cc; cetane number: 58.3; CV: 43.1 MJ/m3;
viscosity: 3.35 cSt) in a CRDI, 4-cylinder, intercooled-turbocharged,
modern high speed transportation engine. Relatively higher bulk
modulus and density of RME didn't influence injection timing in the
CRDI system. Ignition delay was not affected by the difference in
cetane number of diesel and RME. Peak cylinder pressure and HRR
for both, pilot and main injections of RME were slightly higher than
mineral diesel, due to higher burning rate of RME. Due to this, mix-
ing controlled combustion of RME completed slightly earlier than
mineral diesel [149].

PVariations of in-cylinder pressure and HRR for diesel, B25, B50
and B100 at two engine speeds 1500 and 2500 rpm (Fig. 23) shows
that premixed combustion starts earlier D
Xin biodiesel and its blends
at almost all engine speeds, due to their higher cetane number com-
pared to mineral diesel [171]. HRRmax decreased by »18% and 30%
for diesel and biodiesel respectively, due to the reduction in pre-
mixed combustion phase caused by shortening of the ignition delay
between 1500 rpm to 2500 rpm [171].

PSahoo and Das [277] also investigated combustion characteristics
of Jatropha, Karanja and Polanga biodiesel blends and compared
them to baseline mineral diesel. All biodiesel blends showed higher
viscosity, and density and lower calorific value compared to mineral
diesel. Ignition delay of 50% Karanja biodiesel blend (KB50) was
comparable to mineral diesel. Alam et al. [162] reported that SoI
occurred in the same order as the density of the test fuels i.e. higher
the density, earlier will be the SoI. Highest premixed combustion
heat release peak was observed for the fuel with lowest cetane num-
ber [162]. Qi et al. [159] reported that at lower loads, the maximum
cylinder pressure (Pmax), maximum rate of pressure rise (RoPRmax)
and maximum HRR (HRRmax) were slightly higher for biodiesel
compared to baseline mineral diesel. At higher engine loads, Pmax
for both fuels was similar, but RoPRmax and HRRmax were relatively
lower for biodiesel. The SoI and ignition delay for B100 were

Prelatively earlier and shorter than mineral diesel. This was probably
due to combination of different physical properties of test fuels and
fuel quantity related changes in the injection timings. Combined
effect of advanced injection timing and shorter ignition delay of bio-
diesel led to relatively earlier start of combustion (SoC) compared to
mineral diesel [159,174].

PGrimaldi et al. [155] compared the combustion characteristics of
biodiesel (mixture of 70% Rapeseed crude oil biodiesel C 30% Waste
vegetable oil biodiesel) (density: 884 g/cc; cetane number: 55.9; CV:
37.4 MJ/m3; viscosity: 4.43 cSt) with baseline mineral diesel (den-
sity: 834 g/cc; cetane number: 54.7; CV: 42.9 MJ/m3; viscosity:
2.52 cSt) in a high speed direct injection (HSDI) engine equipped
with CRDI system. They reported that after the pilot injection, cylin-
der pressure and average cylinder temperature curves of the CI
engine showed faster increase D
Xto corresponding biodiesel
curves. This significant difference in pilot combustion could be
explained by relatively higher distillation temperature range
and relatively lower calorific value of biodiesel compared to mineral
diesel [155]. After the main injection, higher combustion rate of bio-
diesel was confirmed by higher HRRmax as well as by D
Xsteeper slope
of cumulative heat release (CHR) curve (Fig. 24) [155].

XcomparedD

PCanakci and Van Gerpen [163] compared the combustion
characteristics of Yellow grease methyl ester (YGME) and SME
blended with mineral diesel in a turbocharged diesel engine. Bio-
diesel exhibited relatively earlier SoI and SoC timings compared
to mineral diesel. The SoI timings for SME and YGME advanced
by 2.68° and 3.55° respectively compared to mineral diesel due
to difference in bulk modulus of compressibility of the test fuels.
SME and YGME started to burn »3.4° and 4.2° earlier respectively
compared to mineral diesel [163]. Advanced SoC was primarily
due to relatively earlier SoI timings and higher cetane number
[278]. Combustion characteristics of RME were rather inferior at
low engine load [279]. RME experienced delayed vaporization in
the combustion chamber because of higher middle distillation
temperature, and relatively D
Xnarrower distillation temperature
range, which led to larger sauter mean diameter (SMD) of spray
droplets compared to baseline mineral diesel. Premixed heat
release was unsteady because of concurrent fuel spray vaporiza-
tion and premixed combustion [279]. These combustion charac-
teristics could be improved by increasing the FIP [279]. There

Pspray should disintegrate before the ignition starts and biodiesel
blends up to B40 satisfy this criterion in an unmodified engine
[280].

PYoon et al. [225] investigated the effect of double injection strat-
egy on the combustion characteristics of a biodiesel-ethanol blend
fueled engine and reported that fuel injected in the second injection
pulse combusted rapidly with an extremely short ignition delay.
Pmax and HRRmax of biodiesel-ethanol blend were generally higher
than mineral diesel due to their relatively shorter ignition delay
[225]. HRR analysis of B40 (SME) blended with ULSD in a CRDI
engine showed that for all loads, retarding SoI timing to aTDC side
enhanced premixed combustion [222]. For the same SoI, higher FIP
led to higher HRR and slightly advanced SoC because of improved
fuel-air mixing [225]. At low loads, biodiesel exhibited advanced SoC
and reduced premixed heat release. At moderate to high loads, bio-
diesel did not have any noticeable impact on the HRR [222].

PYamane et al. [281] reported that difference in the bulk modu-
lus of compressibility of biodiesel and mineral diesel increased at
lower temperatures and higher pressures. Very comprehensive
experimental studyD
X on bulk modulus of compressibility and its
effect on fuel injection characteristics of biodiesels was carried out
by Van Gerpen et al. [282(cid:1)285].
In a DICI engine, differences
in the injection characteristics of biodiesel and mineral diesel
became more significant at higher speeds and loads, when the
mean FIP was also high [281]. Boudy and Seers [286] investigated
the effect of fuel properties on the fuel injection quantity and
duration in a CRDI engine. Fuel density is the main property,
which influences the fuel mass injected. Pressure-wave velocity
affects the fuel quantity injected in the second injection pulse dur-
ing multiple injections. Fuel quantity injected decreased with
increasing bulk modulus of compressibility of the test fuel and
increased with increasing fuel density [286]. Kuti et al. [287]
investigated the spray formation and combustion characteristics of
Palm biodiesel and mineral diesel using a CRDI system in a con-
stant volume spray chamber. They reported relatively longer liquid
jet length in case of biodiesel compared to mineral diesel due to
its higher boiling range [287]. Ignition delay was shorter in case of
biodiesel due to its higher cetane number and it further reduced
with increasing FIP and decreasing nozzle hole diameter [287].

PCombustion characteristics of ULSD, B100 (SME), and a syn-
thetic, practically free of sulfur and aromatic compounds Fischer-
Tropsch (FT) diesel were investigated in a 2.5 L, CRDI turbo-
charged diesel engine [176]. Experiments were conducted at
fixed equivalence ratio, BMEP and SoI. Needle lift measurements
showed that SoI timings were constant for different test fuels
Increased injection duration was observed due to

increased fuel mass injected in case of B100,
in addition to
advanced SoC due to higher cetane number of biodiesel [176].
Anand et al. [224] reported that addition of methanol in Karanja
biodiesel shortened the combustion duration.

PHigher viscosity of biodiesel results in an increased combustion
duration. Generally, higher kinematic viscosity of biodiesel signifi-
cantly affects fuel spray, droplet size distribution, droplet evapora-
tion rate, and spray atomization process, resulting in slower
burning therefore having longer combustion duration. However
the opposite trend can be realized by modifying certain fuel injec-
tion parameters, which can potentially lead to shorter combustion
duration for biodiesel compared to mineral diesel at low, medium
and high load conditions. The cloud and pour point of biodiesel
are also higher than mineral diesel, which makes it sensitive to
cold weather conditions, resulting in difficulty in cold starting. In
combination with the effects resulting from ignition delay and
combustion duration, the HRR of biodiesel (due to lower heating
value of D
Xbiodiesel) is relatively lower than mineral diesel, which
reduces the peak pressure rise rate, peak cylinder pressure and
power output.

4.4. Engine wear and durability

PBefore large-scale implementation of biodiesel as alternate
diesel fuel in D
Xtransport sector, there are concerns about its com-
patibility with contemporary engine materials, FIE, and compo-
nents due to its significantly different chemical composition
compared to baseline mineral diesel, which need to be addressed
[146,288,289]. Fazal et al. [288] summarized comparative wear of
engine components from biodiesel and mineral diesel
in their
review article. They observed either lower or similar wear in bio-
diesel/ biodiesel blend fueled engine components compared to
mineral diesel
fueled engine components. These observations
were made in engine studies as well as vehicular field trial studies
[288]. Agarwal et al. [178] carried out 512 h endurance test on a
single cylinder CI engine using B20 (Linseed oil methyl ester) and
another similar engine operating in parallel using mineral diesel.
They concluded that biodiesel does not cause any specific adverse
effect on wear of vital moving components D
Xof the engine. They
reported that the problem of injector coking, lubricating oil dilu-
tion, carbon deposits, ring sticking, fuel pump failure etc., which
exist with the use of straight vegetable oil
in engines, were
Xupon use of biodiesel as a full/ partial sub-
completely eliminated D
stitute of mineral diesel [178]. Verhaeven et al. [177] reported
that there were no significant differences in the wear of injectors
and other FIE components after a 100,000 km field-trial using
RME and UVOME as substitute fuels. At the end of the project,
investigators checked the engine condition by measuring com-
pression pressure and conducting leak test in the combustion
chamber. They reported good health of the engines and no specific
wear of the engine components due to RME or UVOME [177].
Fraer et al. [290] studied the effect of biodiesel on engine durabil-
ity after 4 years of operation and more than 600,000 miles accu-
mulated on eight B20 fueled engines. They reported heavy sludge
around rocker assembly in B20 engines, which was not seen in
diesel fueled engines. It was suggested that probably out of speci-
fication biodiesel was a possible reason for the heavy sludge for-
mation. They concluded that all engines that were investigated,
exhibited normal wear according to their mileage, independent of
the fuel used [290]. Sinha and Agarwal [291] reported that physi-
cal measurements of vital engine components showed relatively
lower wear for B20 (Rice-bran biodiesel) fueled CIDI engine except
the big end bearing, which showed slightly higher wear D
Xcompared
to baseline mineral diesel in a long-term endurance test. They
reported slightly lower wear of cylinder liner in case of B20. For
this, they performed surface roughness profiles at various loca-
tions as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the liner
surface after the endurance test [291]. SEM micrographs of the
liner segments (Fig. 25) from this study depicted that wear was
relatively higher on the anti-thrust side at TDC compared to the
thrust side for both diesel and B20. Overall liner wear was seen to
be significantly lower in B20 fueled engine compared to mineral
diesel fueled engine [270]. In another study, Dhar and Agarwal
[292] investigated the effect of 20% Karanja biodiesel blend (KB20)
on engine wear and durability vis-(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel in a 250 h
endurance test on a DICI engine. Wear characterization of liner
surface showed that for both fuels, surface texture of cylinder lin-
ers remained in acceptable condition after the endurance test
[292].

PDhar and Agarwal [292] also reported that physical wear mea-
surement of engine components showed relatively lower wear of
valves, pistons, piston rings, liners and small end bearing of the con-
necting rods for biodiesel fueled engine compared to mineral diesel
fueled engine. Lower wear of piston rings was confirmed by measur-
ing weight loss after the completion of the endurance test (Fig. 26)
[292]. In another study, Agarwal et al. [293] investigated the effect of
B20 (Linseed oil methyl ester) on durability of CI engine components

Pin a 512 h endurance test. Physical wear measurements in another
experimental study from the same research group reported up to
30% reduction in wear of vital engine components because of addi-
tional lubricity properties of biodiesel [293].

4.5. Carbon deposits on engine components

PIn addition to wear of components, there are carbon deposits in
the engine combustion chamber, which form upon long-term usage.
Several investigators performed experiments to assess comparative
levels of carbon deposits on vital engine components of the engines,
fueled by biodiesels/ blends and mineral diesel.  ̧Cetinkaya et al.
[156] reported same level of carbon deposits on the injectors of D
Xtwo
vehicles fueled with WCOB and mineral diesel in the first phase of
7500 km road test during winterD
X. Second phase of the study used vis-
cosity improvers added to biodiesel. It was observed that the injec-
tors were relatively cleaner than mineral diesel fueled engine's
injectors [156]. Tziourtzioumis et al. [157] investigated an engine
with CRDI fuel injection system for 30 h with B70 under steady-state
Xhowever they reportedly experienced
and transient conditions,
starting problems. Biodiesel used in this study was a fatty acid
methyl ester produced using 40% rapeseed oil, 30% soybean oil and
30% recycled cooking oil. They reported existence of significant
quantity of dense slurry, rich in fatty esters in the fuel filters. They
also reported that injector nozzle holes were covered by heavy
and oily carbonaceous deposits, making them function in an erratic
manner [157]. Armas et al. [294] compared the effect of etha-
nol(cid:1)biodiesel(cid:1)diesel blend (7.7%¡27.69%¡69.61%) and baseline
mineral diesel in a CRDI system equipped engine in a 600 h acceler-
study showed that use of etha-
ated durability test. This
nol(cid:1)biodiesel(cid:1)diesel blend and baseline diesel had similar effect on
durability of the fuel injection pump components and injector nozzle
[294]. Pehan et al. [295] also reported identical carbon deposits in
the combustion chamber of biodiesel and diesel fueled engines. Sem
[296] reported piston skirt deposits and ring groove deposits in four
biodiesel fueled engines and these deposits were absent in diesel
fueled engines.

PDhar and Agarwal [292] reported higher carbon deposits on pis-
ton top, cylinder head and injector tip for B20 fueled engine com-
pared to diesel fueled engine during the endurance test, primarily
due to higher carbon residue and lower volatility of biodiesel
(Fig. 27). Results for higher carbon deposits on piston top were also
Xconfirmed by measuring the weight of carbon deposited on the pis-
ton tops (Fig. 28).

PIt was reported that lower volatility of biodiesel increased the
heat release during late combustion phase, leading to lesser time
available for in-cylinder combustion/ oxidation of soot. This resulted

4.6. Material compatibility

PAutomotive manufacturers face a major challenge related to
compatibility of automotive engine components with biodiesel. Its
different chemical structure (influenced by both feedstock and rem-
nants of the production process) than mineral diesel renders it with
certain undesirable properties such as auto-oxidation, hygroscopic
nature, higher electrical conductivity, polarity and solvency, which

be compatible with biodiesel [297]. Kaul et al. [298] compared the

(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel on piston and liner materials. They concluded
that biodiesel derived from Pilu was most corrosive, followed by
Jatropha, while Karanja and Mahua biodiesels showed lesser corro-
sion than mineral diesel [298]. Besee and Fay [299] reported that
biodiesel was not compatible with nitrile rubber, nylon 6/6 and high
density poly-propylene. However Teflon and Viton showed reason-
ably good compatibility with B100 [299]. Van Gerpen et al. [300]

P[302]. Lubricating oil dilution D
Xby fuel is affected by variations in
physical properties of the test fuel, such as biodiesel or mineral die-
sel. Biodiesel, which contains oxygen and double bonds in its molec-
ular structure, is D
Xmore reactive than mineral diesel. Therefore, effect
of biodiesel on lubricating oil degradation needs to be evaluated in a
long-duration engine endurance study. Some studies experimentally
evaluated lubricating oil degradation in long-duration tests in static
engine tests as well as vehicle tests [177,291,296,303(cid:1)307].

PThere are few studies, which explored the effect of biodiesels on
the lubricating oil degradation in vehicles. Experiments were con-
ducted to investigate the effect of RME and UVOME on engine dura-
Xspanning over 100,000 km [177].

Lubricating oil samples were drawn and analyzed at a regular inter-
val D
X7500 km. No difference in degradation of the lubricat-
ing oil was observed [177]. Staat et al. [303] conducted field trials
spread over 3 years on 2000 vehicles in France, which were using
RME. For the vehicles operating with more than 50% RME in the test
fuel, slightly higher reduction in lubricating oil viscosity with usage
was reported however there was no significant effect of RME blend-
ing D
Xon oil change intervals [303]. They also reported that for more
than 30% RME blends, although reduction in lubricating oil viscosity
was observed but wear and cleanliness of RME fuelled engines were
as good as the reference fuel (Baseline diesel) or even better [303].

Xof 107 cSt. Total alkaline number (TAN)
increased to 8.24 mg KOH g¡1 from the initial value of 7.89 mg
KOH g¡1. For B100 and B20, viscosity of lubricating oil reduced to
96.8 and 96.1 cSt respectively after 300 h [308]. Total alkaline num-
bers of B100 and B20 fuelled engine's lubricating oils were 8.26 and
8.05 mg KOH g¡1 respectively. There was no significant negative
influence of Palm biodiesel on the lubricating oil degradation [308].
Reece and Peterson [309] reported acceptable levels of trace wear
metal concentrations in the lubricating oil samples drawn from min-
eral diesel and B20 (RME) fuelled vehicles in 80,000 km field trial of
two pickups.

PThere are several studies reported in open literature, which also
explored the effect of biodiesels on the lubricating oil degradation in
engines. Agarwal [306] studied for the effect of B20 (Linseed oil
methyl ester) on the tribological properties of lubricating oil in a
512 h endurance test. Lower fuel dilution was observed in lubricat-
ing oil sample drawn from biodiesel fuelled engine, which was also
confirmed by measurement of viscosity and flash point of the lubri-
cating oil samples [306]. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
studies of the lubricating oil samples indicated higher oxidation of
lubricating oil samples drawn from B20 fueled engine [306]. In
another experimental study, Agarwal et al. [293] confirmed lower
wear of B20 fuelled engine by analyzing the lubricating oil samples.
Lower ash content of used lubricating oil drawn from B20 fuelled
engine indicated lower wear debris [293]. Sinha and Agarwal [305]
also reported lower fuel dilution of lubricating oil in case of B20
fuelled engine vis-(cid:1)a-vis mineral diesel fuelled engine. They reported
higher lubricating oil density and lower moisture content in the
lubricating oil samples drawn from B20 fuelled engine D
Xcompared to
samples drawn from diesel fueled engine D
X[305]. Resinous content in
the lubricating oil samples was calculated by finding the difference
in pentane and benzene insoluble [310]. Lower resinous content in
B20 fuelled engine suggested relatively lower lubricating oil degra-
dation over time. Thornton et al. [310] reported comparatively
higher fuel dilution of lubricating oil in B20 (soy biodiesel) fuelled

Xto mineral diesel fuelled engine but there was no
trace of any biodiesel related additional wear [310].

PAnalysis of trace metals present in lubricating oil provideD

information about wear of engine components [303,311]. Sinha and
Agarwal [291] reported relatively lower trace metals (Fe, Cr, Cu, Zn,
Ni and Mg) in the lubricating oil samples drawn from B20 (Rice

engine) compared to mineral diesel fueled engine in a 100 h endur-
ance test (Fig. 29). However, Pb and Al were found to be in slightly
higher concentration in the lubricating oil drawn from B20 fueled
engine, which may be due to attack of biodiesel on paints and
bearings [291, 311].

PAgarwal et al. [312] reported relatively lower concentration of

PSchumacher et al. [301] compared trace metals in the lubricating

mineral diesel fueled engine. They reported lower concentration of
Pb, Fe and higher concentration of Si in the lubricating oil samples
drawn from biodiesel fueled engine [301]. Concentrations of Cu and
Cr were comparable in the lubricating oils samples though [301].
Raadnui and Meenak [314] reported same level of trace metals in
the lubricating oil samples drawn from the engine using refined
Palm oil and mineral dieselD
X. Replacing diesel with biodiesel reduced
wear of Al, Fe, Cr and Pb containing components in the engine [315].
PSem [296] also evaluated the performance of different lubricating
oils in biodiesel fueled engines. They reported that synthetic lubri-
cating oils were more stable, and more responsive to the additives
used for extending the residual useful life of the lubricating oil.
Higher additive levels in the lubricating oils contributed to reduction
in piston skirt deposits in B100 fueled engine [296].

the engine. Engine oil dilution by biodiesel is caused by its relatively
lower volatility and lower oxidation stability compared to mineral
diesel. With breakdown of biodiesel molecules, both oxidation and

The future of this route of biodiesel production is essentially depen-
dent on reducing the production cost of enzymatic catalysts, which
could deliver higher biodiesel yield. Biodiesel production using
transesterification of triglycerides requires purification steps for cat-
alyst removal, which increases the production cycle time, reduces
biodiesel yield and generates large quantity of contaminated waste
water. All these factors increase the cost of final product i.e. biodie-
sel. Supercritical alcoholysis is another method of biodiesel produc-
tion, which can potentially overcome some of these issues. Absence

XLCA
studies showed that generally biodiesel usage positively contributesD
to GHG emission reduction and it had net energy ratio higher than
1.3, which is favorable.

PAlmost all experimental studies reported successful operation of
CI engines with biodiesel derived from a variety of feedstocks and
their blends with mineral diesel in short duration engine tests. There
are several scientific studies, which covered long-duration endur-
ance tests on biodiesels and blends as well. Variations in perfor-
mance, emissions and combustion characteristics of the engines
using biodiesel with respect to conventional mineral diesel consider-
ably depends on biodiesel properties, biodiesel blend percentage
and engine technology used, with special emphasis on fuel injection
technology, FIP and possibility of having split injection. Brake power
output/ torque generated by the engines fueled by biodiesel pro-
duced from different feedstocks is reportedly lower than baseline
mineral diesel fueled engines, barring few exceptions. BSFC of bio-
diesels and blends is generally slightly higher than mineral diesel in
most experimental studies and it depends on the FIP, injection strat-
egy and fuel injection technology employed in the engine to a great
extent. Biodiesel derived from different feedstocks and their blends
with mineral diesel and/ or alcohols can deliver slightly higher BTE
than baseline mineral diesel, except very few studies, which showed
lower BTE of biodiesel. Nevertheless, engine performance of biodie-
sels is conclusively comparable to that of baseline mineral diesel.

PCO emissionD

Xwas generally lower for biodiesel and blends com-
pared to baseline mineral diesel. The extent of reduction remained a
function of biodiesel feedstock, C/ H ratio of the test fuel (compared
to mineral diesel), fuel viscosity, oxygen content, cetane number, D

type, FIP, fuel injection strategy and engine operating parameters.
General trend suggests that usage of biodiesel and blends lead to
substantial reduction in THC and CO emissions in lower FIP engines
however this advantage of lower CO and THC emissions is reduced
in modern CRDI engines, which operate at relatively higher FIP. CRDI
engines are ECU controlled engines and can be extensively opti-
mized for the test fuel properties. Hence it is essential to recalibrate
the ECU for improving the emission characteristics of biodiesel and
Xblends vis-(cid:1)a-vis baseline mineral diesel. NOx emission increase from
biodiesel fueled engines can't be quantitatively determined by a
change in a single fuel property. Rather it is a result of number of
coupled mechanisms, whose effects reinforces or cancels one
another under different engine operating conditions, depending on
specific combustion and fuel characteristics. Fuel-air mixtures closer
to stoichiometric at the time of ignition and in the standing pre-
mixed auto-ignition zone near the flame lift-off length appear to be
a key factor in helping NOx increase from biodiesel fueled engine
under all conditions. These differences result inD

X. All these factors increase
X. Differences in prompt NO formation and

species concentrations resulting from fuel and jet-structure changes
also play important role in higher NOx formation from biodiesel. The
particle size-number distribution and chemical composition of par-
ticulate varies greatly, depending on engine type, engine speed, fuel
composition, lubricating oil formulation, and emission control tech-
nology employed in the engine. Generally, biodiesel fueled engines
emitted lower PM mass emissions than mineral diesel
fueled
engines. B100 reduced the accumulation mode particle numbers and
produced higher number of nucleation mode particles compared to
ULSD at higher FIP. Higher nucleation mode particle formation was
assumed to be because of higher SOF. Long-chain fatty acids methyl
esters (FAME) of biodiesels are chemically more reactive than hydro-
carbon molecules of mineral diesel. This leads to possibility of for-

biodiesel and blends can be significant though there is limited data
available in open literature, which is often contradictory. Neverthe-
less, these unregulated emissions amongst others are of greater
importance as some of the species are toxic, mutagenic, and even
carcinogenic to humans. Most research studies showed that emis-
sions of aromatic and polyaromatic compounds from biodiesel were
lower compared to mineral diesel however they were influenced by
engine operating conditions such as engine load, driving cycle, and
operating mode etc.

can be realized by modifying certain fuel injection parameters,
which can lead to shorter combustion duration in case of biodiesel
compared to mineral diesel at low, medium and high load condi-
tions. Lower energy content of biodiesel combined with the effects
resulting from ignition delay and combustion duration, the HRR of
biodiesel (due to lower heating value of the biodiesel) is relatively
lower than mineral diesel, which reduces the peak pressure rise
rate, peak cylinder pressure and power output.

Lower wear of piston rings was also confirmed by measuring weight
loss after the completion of the endurance test. Up to 30% lower
wear of vital engine components of biodiesel fuelled engine was
attributed to additional lubricity properties of biodiesel. In addition
to wear of components, there are carbon deposits in the engine com-
bustion chamber, which form upon long-term usage. Higher carbon
deposits on the piston top, cylinder head and injector tip for B20
fuelled engine compared to diesel fuelled engine during the endur-
ance test, form primarily due to higher carbon residue and lower
volatility of biodiesel. Biodiesel's different chemical structure (influ-
enced by both feedstock and remnants of the production process)

of metals combined with other environmental factors are some of
