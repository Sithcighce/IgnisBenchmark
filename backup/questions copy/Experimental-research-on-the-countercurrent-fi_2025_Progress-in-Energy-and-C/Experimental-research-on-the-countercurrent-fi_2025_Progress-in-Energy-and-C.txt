Fixed-bed  combustion  is  the  oldest  and  most  flexible  method  for  generating  heat  from  solid  fuels  with
diverse morphological characteristics. This approach consolidates countercurrent fixed-bed burners as the
most employed technique for biomass combustion in small- and medium-scale installations. In recent decades,
researchers worldwide have generated significant experimental evidence to decipher the complex mechanisms
behind reaction front propagation using laboratory-scale burners, which simulate the conditions of fuel in
industrial plants. Many experimental results are available in the scientific literature, and the consolidation
and discussion of the most relevant data can be useful for better understanding the current state of the art and
identifying knowledge gaps on the subject. This paper presents a systematic review of the available literature
concerning experimental studies of biomass fixed-bed combustion in laboratory-scale reactors. The central
discussion encompasses the definition of the parameters employed to characterize the reaction zone behaviour
and their dependence on fuel properties and primary air conditions. The insights gained in this review were
addressed to propose criteria for harnessing the abundant availability of agricultural residues as alternative
fuels in grate-firing systems.

1. Introduction

In some industrialized countries, solid biomass represents approx-
imately 15% of electricity generation, such as in Finland, Denmark

2

and Estonia, or between 5% and 10%, which is the case in the United
Kingdom, Sweden and Brazil. The use of solid biomass for heating has
grown in countries utilizing district heating (Denmark, Estonia, Sweden
Finland) to replace fossil fuels [1] and in industrial processes, as in
Germany [2]. Historically, biomass has been the oldest primary energy
source known to humanity, and is used as fuel to produce thermal
energy and power by direct combustion. The benefits of biomass as
an energy source have encouraged governments to implement policies
to increase biomass participation in their national energy mix [3,4].
Increasing  the  use  of  biomass  can  contribute  to  achieving  some  of
the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations
General  Assembly  in  2015,  accelerating  energy  transition  measures
and reducing the impacts of climate change by reducing greenhouse
gas  (GHG)  emissions  [5,6].  Such  policies  can  encourage  the  devel-
opment and use of unconventional biomass, especially agro-industrial
waste. Furthermore, biomass combustion, when combined with carbon
capture  and  storage,  can  be  a  relevant  actor  in  the  defossilization
of  processes  that  are  inextricably  linked  to  carbon  utilization  and
are therefore difficult to electrify, such as transportation, especially
aviation, and carbohydrate chemistry [7–9].

In  2022,  10.1%  of  the  primary  energy  supplied  on  the  planet
came from biomass sources [10]. However, biomass remains underuti-
lized for large-scale production of thermal energy and electricity [11].
Among  the  available  solid  fuel  combustion  technologies,  fixed-bed
reactors  present  greater  flexibility  to  burn  different  granulometries
and lower operational and installation investments [12,13]. Although
fixed-bed systems dominated coal-burning technologies during the first
part of the 20th century, their implementation in large-scale plants
(>150 MW, thermal) for heat generation is currently obsolete [12,14].
However, many units are still installed worldwide, mainly for biomass
combustion.

The operation of thermal power and electricity generation facilities
powered by traditional fossil fuels is affected by the cost and availabil-
ity of fuel, in addition to legal and environmental restrictions. Under
certain conditions, the use of residues from agro-industrial processes
can be a good alternative for replacing traditional fuels. Some indus-
tries, such as sugarcane and palm oil [15,16], already use biomass
residue from the process to produce heat and electricity to meet their
own energy needs. Facilities that have an efficient combustion system
and integrate combustion processes with cogeneration can produce sur-
plus electricity destined for local or regional distribution network. For
example, in Brazil, just in 2020, 6.0% of the electricity supplied came
from sugarcane processing plants [17], which use residual bagasse to
power steam generators. Biomasses used in agro-industrial processes
are usually available only during the harvest and processing periods.
Some industries, such as the sugarcane industry, do not operate year-
round. Facilities that have the capacity to sell surplus electricity may
have a period of inactivity if they rely solely on residual biomass from
the  process,  and  the  search  for  alternative  biomasses  for  operation
during  the  off-season  can  improve  the  profitability  of  such  plants.
In  addition,  technological  developments  in  the  production  of  other
products and biofuels have opened the possibility of using new process
residues, such as residual lignin, which is a residue from the production
of second-generation ethanol [18]. High flexibility is a characteristic of
fixed-bed combustion systems, and such systems have been present in
most agroindustries, as they have small- and medium-capacity steam
production facilities.

An  improved  combustion  performance  implies  high  combustion
efficiency and low emissions of gaseous pollutants and solid particulate

matter. To achieve this, several operational parameters such as airflow
under the grate, distribution of primary and secondary air, and resi-
dence time of solid fuel need to be optimized and controlled. Ideally,
combustion  conditions  and  parameters  can  be  obtained  experimen-
tally by direct measurements of industrial combustion systems when
in operation. Nevertheless, there are several technical and economic
limitations to taking measurements in industrial installations. Although
computational modelling offers detailed insight into the thermochem-
ical conversion phenomena of fuel, the consistency and precision of
the results depend on data and assumed hypotheses from experimental
measurements [19–21].

There  are  many  experimental  techniques  for  studying  solid  fuel
combustion,  and  laboratory-scale  fixed-bed  reactors  have  attributes
that justify their application in characterizing the behaviour of different
fuels [22–24]. Fixed-bed reactors are relevant for their sample size
and the conditions emulated during combustion tests, which are close
to those observed in industrial installations [25]. These experimen-
tal  setups  allow  direct  monitoring  of  the  relevant  bed  combustion
parameters, such as the ignition and burning rates.

Several experimental studies in laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactors
have evaluated the combustion behaviour of biomass under different
combinations  of  operational  parameters.  The  results  obtained  from
these work support the current knowledge about (i) ignition front prop-
agation; (ii) pollutant formation; and (iii) particulate matter emission.
Additionally, the acquired data provide the basis for validating numer-
ical models. Despite the significant volume of experimental research
conducted on the fixed-bed combustion of biomass, the information
remains scattered across numerous studies, lacking a comprehensive
synthesis. This absence of organization hinders critically approaching
the state-of-the-art to identify gaps for future research.

A few reviews on fixed-bed biomass combustion have been pub-
lished,  mainly  addressing  technological  aspects  or  numerical  mod-
elling. Yin et al. [19] reviewed biomass combustion in industrial fixed-
bed reactors. This paper presents aspects of relevant topics such as
equipment description, secondary air supply distribution, ash-related
deposition  formation,  and  computational  models.  Nevertheless,  the
work  does  not  include  a  detailed  description  of  the  process  inside
the bed. Recman and Hájek [26] reviewed the main characteristics of
laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactors from different installations world-
wide. In this review, the authors focused only on technical charac-
teristics.  Khodaei  et  al.  [20]  presented  a  summary  of  the  different
modelling approaches for fixed-bed biomass combustion at the labora-
tory scale. This work stands out because it defines relevant properties
of bed combustion, such as the consumption rate, ignition front veloc-
ity, peak temperature, and reaction zone thickness. Dernbecher et al.
[21] revised the numerical methodologies applied in biomass fixed-
bed combustion modelling at different scales. This work distinguishes
each  subprocess  involved  in  biomass  combustion  and  classifies  the
approaches adopted to simulate the reactions in the bed zone at dif-
ferent degrees of complexity. However, these papers do not offer a
consolidated view of experimental findings.

The present paper systematically reviews the literature on exper-
imental studies of biomass fixed-bed combustion in laboratory-scale
reactors. Because most of the current fixed-bed burners for biomass
combustion operate in a countercurrent regime, we limited the scope
of  this  review  to  such  techniques.  Initially,  we  employed  a  search
strategy to collect the pertinent literature from databases. Thereafter,
we selected only articles related to the following topics: biomass com-
bustion,  experimental  studies  in  laboratory-scale  fixed-bed  reactors
in the countercurrent regime, and numerical studies accompanied by
experimental validation carried out by the same authors. In this review,
we synthesize and consolidate from a phenomenological perspective
the knowledge generated about the flame propagation process in a
biomass fixed-bed combustor. Furthermore, the experimental method-
ologies, fuel properties, and operating conditions are described and
analysed to offer a comprehensive perspective on the topic.

The  content  of  this  review  is  as  follows:  first,  we  describe  the
combustion process of a solid fuel particle, highlighting the specific
characteristics of biomass combustion behaviour. Then, we describe the
technology of solid fuel combustion in a fixed bed and its main oper-
ational characteristics and limitations. The laboratory-scale fixed-bed
reactors are then depicted together with the systems that compound
the experimental setup. In the next section, we explain the process of
ignition front propagation along a fixed-bed in a countercurrent regime.
This section defines the parameters needed to assess the combustion
performance and the techniques to determine them from the measure-
ments during the experiments. Later, we discuss the effects of variations
in  the  operational  conditions  in  fixed-bed  combustion.  This  section
presents the reported evidence in the publications reviewed. Finally,
we share the main conclusions and the detected gaps in the knowledge
generated over the decades regarding fixed-bed combustion of biomass.

2. Solid fuel particle combustion

Many studies have aimed to follow the evolution of fuel particles
during  their  combustion  in  real  time.  Different  experimental  tech-
niques, such as thermogravimetry [27–29], optic pyrometry [30,31],
and high speed cinematography [32–36] have been used for this pur-
pose. The results demonstrate that every solid fuel particle undergoes
sequential  phases  during  combustion  regardless  of  the  fuel  burned.
However, the evolution and duration of each stage depend on the origin
and physicochemical characteristics of the fuel used.

Fig.  1 illustrates the combustion of a fuel particle inside a high-
temperature environment with similar conditions to those observed in
industrial furnaces. Initially, the particle absorbs heat at a high rate,
resulting in a sharp rise in temperature. This increase persists until the
particle surpasses the temperature at which vapour pressure exceeds
ambient pressure, reaching the boiling point and initiating the drying
process. Part of the heat transferred to the particle is absorbed as en-
thalpy of vaporization of the moisture contained in the particle. Excess
thermal energy increases the temperature of the particle to initiate
the release of volatile material in the fuel. This process is defined as
pyrolysis. During pyrolysis, a cloud composed of combustible gases,
soot, and tar surrounds the solid matrix and isolates its contact with
the oxygen [30,31]. The released gases mix with oxygen by diffusion
and convection. Owing to the gradual increase in temperature, the
gaseous mixture reaches its ignition point, and a homogeneous flame
forms around the particle. Depending on the flow of oxidant present,
the flame varies in size and intensity [37,38]. The heat released by
the flame promotes the pyrolysis step in the particle. As each layer
in the particle exhausts its volatile content, a carbonaceous material,
named char, and ashes remain in the solid matrix. As the release of
volatiles prevents oxygen from accessing the carbonaceous matrix, the
char does not react with oxygen initially. However, the carbon dioxide
and water vapour produced during the reaction reach the char surface,
starting reactions. Under some conditions, depending on the tempera-
ture, oxygen concentration, particle size, and particle motion relative
to the volatile cloud, simultaneous combustion of the char particle and
volatiles may occur [30]. When all volatile contents are depleted, the
gas cloud size decreases, and eventually, the oxygen encounters the
char, starting its oxidation and gasification. This process lasts until the
combustible material contained in the particle is consumed.

As the temperature of the particle increases, a conversion front ap-
pears inside it that propagates from the outermost layers (Fig.  1). This
front leads each layer through the drying, pyrolysis, and char oxidation
stages. The propagation speed of such a front depends on the particle
size, its orientation in the airflow [39], and the external conditions,
which are related to the Biot number (Bi). The Biot number provides
a criterion for any modelling involving transport by convection and
diffusion [19,40–42]. When Bi < 0.1, the internal temperature and
concentration gradients may be neglected, simplifying the problem by
a thermally thin particle approach. On the other hand, when Bi ≥ 0.1,

the particles are considered thermally thick and inner heat diffusion
must be considered. The particle thermal behaviour influences the time
necessary for complete combustion inside the reactor and offers a basis
for selecting the most suitable burning technology.

2.1. General characteristics of biomass as solid fuel

In 2008, biomass accounted for only 26.9% of the world’s solid fuel
primary energy generation, with the remainder coming from coal [43].
Although in 2022, biomass fuel generation accounted for 43.5% of solid
fuels [10], coal is still the predominant source of solid fuel primary
energy.  Owing  to  the  nature  and  composition  of  biomass  particles,
their combustion presents considerable differences compared with the
behaviour observed in coal:

- Although some examples of high-volatile lignite coal exist [44],
the general trend in the literature shows that biomass has a higher
volatile content (60%–80%) than does coal (20%–30%). Conse-
quently, the reaction of biomass particles presents a more ex-
tended pyrolysis stage that starts at lower temperatures than that
of coal particles [29,31,45–47]. During this phase, the biomass
particles  release  most  of  their  energy  content  [48].  The  high
volatile material content in biomass is due to its high molar H/C
and O/C ratios. Similarly, the presence of alkali has an impact
on the production of volatiles, tar, and on the reactivity of the
particle [49–52]. These elements act as catalysts in oxidation and
pyrolysis reactions, reducing the temperatures at which this stage
starts and increasing the volatile release rates [53].

- Although the elevated amount of oxygen bonded to the biomass
structure covers part of the structure needed for particle combus-
tion [54], its high level impacts the higher heating value (HHV)
of the biomass. The HHV of biomass is lower than those of other
fuels. However, the resulting char after the pyrolysis phase tends
to be more reactive than the char obtained during the combustion
of coal [48]. In addition, the alkalis in the biomass also have
a catalytic effect on the production of the char remaining after
pyrolysis [49,50,52].

- Biomass has a higher moisture content than other solid fuels.
This excess moisture delays the pyrolysis and ignition of volatiles
because of the energy required to dry the particles. Nevertheless,
the reduction in alkali content reduces the problems related to
deposit formation on the surfaces of the furnace [32]. Potassium
and sodium, for example, exist in the form of ions bound to the
organic matrix or as precipitated salts [51,52]. Alkali compounds
are released during the reaction in two stages that coincide with
the pyrolysis and char combustion phases [52].

3. Fixed-bed combustion technology

The behaviour of solid fuel and its evolution throughout the sequen-
tial stages of combustion depend on the geometry and physicochemical

4

properties of the particle. These properties lead to technical challenges
when selecting a suitable combustion technology for a given solid fuel.
The considered approaches differ for each fuel type [56].

Diverse burning techniques exist for solid fuels that work under
a fluid-dynamic regime of fuel particles. Hence, the technologies for
solid fuel combustion are classified into fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, and
entrained bed technologies (see Fig.  2).

In  a  fixed-bed  reactor,  the  superficial  gas  velocity  that  crosses
the bed in an upwards direction is insufficient to generate relative
movement between solid particles. If the gas velocity increases over the
minimal fluidization velocity, the fuel particles enter a state of partial
suspension that enables every particle to move randomly in the bed.

Fixed-bed combustion represents the most established method for
the utilization of solid fuels [13,55]. In these systems, particles stacked
on the grate form a porous medium through which the combustion
air flows, promoting thermochemical reactions in the solid phase. The
combustible gases released during the pyrolysis and gasification stages
together with the entrained fine particles burn in suspension through
secondary air injection. There are different classifications for fixed-
bed burners depending on: (1) the manner in which the fuel particles
feed the reactor — underfeed, overfeed, and spread-stokers; (2) the
mechanism  used  to  move  the  bed  inside  the  burner  —  travelling,
moving, vibrating, and chain grate; and (3) the direction in which the
flame front propagates relative to the airflow direction — cocurrent
and countercurrent (Fig.  3). However, the latter classification is usu-
ally employed in terms of the physics phenomena presented during
bed combustion. As shown in Fig.  3, countercurrent systems have an
ignition front that advances towards the air inlet, with fresh fuel closer
to this inlet, whereas cocurrent devices have an ignition front that
advances away from the air inlet.

The  reaction  zone  is  the  region  inside  the  bed  where  the  fuel
particles enter the combustion stage. The reaction zone is very narrow
in a countercurrent setup because the flame front and oxidant stream
flow in opposite directions. Fresh fuel is heated mainly by radiation,
as the air flow and the ignition wave advance in opposite directions,
preventing other forms of heat transport from being effective [57].
Consequently,  the  flame  front  propagates  slowly  along  the  bed.  In
contrast, in a cocurrent setup, as the oxidant flow and flame front
move in the same direction, radiation and convection contribute to
the combustion heat reaching a broader region of unreacted particles.
Therefore, the reaction zone is thicker in the cocurrent regime and
propagates faster than in the countercurrent mechanism. Despite their
disadvantage compared with the cocurrent setup, the countercurrent
mechanism is extensively used in grate-combustion installations. Con-
versely, cocurrent air flow and reaction front systems are more common
in gasification processes.

Fixed-bed  reactors  are  highly  flexible  in  that  they  are  suitable
for the combustion of feedstock that would be deemed inappropriate
for other technologies owing to their particle size or chemistry. For
this reason, they are widely used in biomass cogeneration plants and

structural  configuration  [65–67].  There  are  limitations  to  accessing
industrial burners with measurement instruments, especially in grate
combustion systems, where the main combustion reactions occur within
the bed [65,66,68]. In contrast, experimental setups involve simplistic
geometries and total control over operative parameters, allowing the
continuous monitoring of a fuel sample during its combustion. These
setups  facilitate  an  understanding  of  the  basic  physical  phenomena
behind the macroscopic behaviour around solid fuel combustion.

Among the different experimental techniques used to study solid
fuel combustion, laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactors stand out because
the conditions emulated during their operation are very close to those
observed in industrial equipment [25,69,70]. These systems are robust
tools for observing bed behaviour as a function of controlled variations
in operational parameters [71]. Fig.  4 shows a schematic representation
of a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor setup and the basic systems that
compose it. These systems include the following:

Combustion chamber The combustion chamber consists of a circular
or  rectangular  container  inside  which  the  sample  is  placed.
These  vessels  have  internal  diameters  between  150  mm  and
250 mm, with heights ranging from 800 mm to 1500 mm. At
the bottom of the chamber, the sample rests on a grate through
which the oxidant gas enters. Although bricks were initially used
to build combustion chambers [72], in general, stainless steel
is the material employed because of its high temperatures and
corrosion strength [60,73–79]. However, the combustion cham-
ber is usually thermally isolated to increase the replicability of
the results and enable their comparison with other methods.
Along the combustion chamber, several orifices are used for
measurement  and  gas  sampling.  Some  work  have  adapted  a
section  for  direct  observation  of  the  evolution  of  a  sample,
using glass with high thermal resistance [80–83]. Furthermore,
some installations include additional systems on the freeboard
to study some processes present in industrial burners, such as
heat exchangers [84] or heat deflectors [82].

Combustion air supply system A fan is typically the main compo-
nent of a combustion air supply system. This fan sends the air
from the atmosphere to the plenum under the grate through
a duct. The grate distributes the air entering the combustion
chamber through its orifices and supports the fuel bed. Gen-
erally, the porosity of a grate coincides with those employed
in industrial furnaces [85]. The fan’s motor rotation speed is
controlled to obtain the desired airflow rate. Some setups in-
corporate  air  staging  [86],  exhaust  gas  recirculation  [87]  or

municipal solid waste incineration [13,58] to reduce the large volume
of waste generated and, at the same time, produce thermal energy [48,
59,60]. Additionally, residential and domestic appliances extensively
use this technology to burn biomass, such as wood logs, for heating
purposes [61,62]. However, many medium- and large-sized fixed-bed
combustion  apparatuses  for  burning  biofuels  must  be  updated.  The
design of these plants was initially derived from combustors for burning
coal [48]. Therefore, the use of biomass requires adaptations to en-
sure regular equipment performance during operation. Although some
problems remain during the operation of fixed-bed burners, such as
unburned carbon losses, particulate matter emissions, and combustion
instabilities, these installations manage to fulfil their primary functions.
These  problems  are  associated  with  knowing  the  most  appropriate
operating conditions to burn the growing biomass supply with energy
potential [63,64].

The following sections present the principal results of work related

to biomass particle combustion in fixed-bed reactors.

4. Description of laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactors

Establishing operating criteria for the efficient performance of com-
bustion devices requires knowledge of the transformations that fuel
undergoes during combustion. Ideally, such transformations should be
monitored under the burner’s operating conditions. However, this task
involves technical and economic challenges because of the equipment’s

a  continuous  fuel-feeding  system.  Other  systems  add  electric
heaters to study the effect of air preheating over the combustion
bed.

Measurement and acquisition system Because of the large samples
used  in  the  experiments,  it  is  possible  to  measure  the  local
properties inside the bed during continuous combustion. The
properties monitored during each experiment include the fol-
lowing.

- Bed temperature variation: Thermocouples inserted into
the bed through orifices along the combustion chamber
measure the temperature variation. In the region where
the combustion chamber is filled with bed particles, the ra-
diative effect on temperature is difficult to assess, because
the particles in the bed surround each inserted thermo-
couple  and  may  be  in  direct  contact  with  the  thermo-
couple. Radiation can affect the absolute value measured,
but the conditions are similar for all thermocouples, and
the differential behaviour between thermocouples is main-
tained. However, this simplification is inconsistent in the
combustion chamber over the bed, the freeboard [88].
- Flue gas composition: The composition of combustion
gases can be determined continuously or noncontinuously.
Such measurements are made through in situ gas sampling,
as the presence of solid fuel prevents the application of
optical systems (e.g. laser absorption) to infer the con-
centration of species and radicals, as can be done in ex-
perimental gas-phase combustion systems [89]. However,
solid matter in condensed phases (tars, particulate mate-
rial) and high temperatures generate extreme conditions
for in situ measurements. Therefore, most experimental
setups  integrate  a  flue  gas  sample  conditioning  system
before the gas analyser system. This solution has limited
the understanding of the evolution of gaseous species from
their liberation from fuel particles.

- Mass variation: Electronic balances are used to record the
mass variation of the fuel bed over time. This setup can be
configured either with the reactor suspended or placed on
top of the balance to ensure precise mass measurements
throughout the combustion process.

Despite the simplicity of these setups, researchers and engineers
have drawn operation criteria from experimental results over the most
critical parameters in fixed-bed combustion, namely, the air flux, fuel
feeding rate, and ignition time. Furthermore, the results obtained offer

6

data to validate numerical models. Nevertheless, some discrepancies
arise because the samples consist of a batch of particles. In an exper-
imental setup, each fuel particle conserves its position relative to the
other during the test. However, some grate types induce movements on
the bed to improve combustion in industrial burners. The absence of
movement in a sample is the primary error source when experimental
results are applied to industrial burners with grates that induce particle
movement [69,70,90,91]. Even so, the data obtained are very accurate
for travelling grate burners [69,92,93].

In addition to the above discrepancies, fuel particles are ideally
packed  in  a  laboratory-scale  fixed-bed  reactor  with  a  uniform  size
distribution. Otherwise, the odd high-porosity spots inside the bed may
induce bed channelling [94]. Channelling is caused by interconnected
void spaces in the matrix formed by the packed bed, allowing air or
gases to flow in preferential paths. These preferential routes cause the
ignition front to propagate much faster along the inner surfaces of the
passage than over other surfaces of the bed, causing chaotic burning
patterns and significant fluctuations and peaks in temperature [94–97].
In the last section of this review, we discuss channelling. In the fol-
lowing paragraphs, we describe the combustion process of an ideally
packed bed as observed during an experimental test.

5. Fuel particle fixed-bed combustion

Fig.  5 illustrates a laboratory-scale reactor’s fixed-bed combustion
process with a batch countercurrent configuration. Following ignition
on the bed surface, an ignition front forms and propagates downwards
across  the  bed  in  the  opposite  direction  of  the  air  stream  (Fig.   5-
a). This wave is flat and normal to its path because of the uniform
temperature distribution along the cross-section [66,72,98,99]. When
the ignition front reaches unreacted fuel particles, their temperature
suddenly increases, causing such particles to undergo drying and py-
rolysis phases (Fig.  5-b). Pyrolysis gases enter combustion, consuming
oxygen from the air flow. Char particles compose the layers left behind
by the ignition front, exposing them to oxygen, combustion gases, and
volatiles. In this environment, combustion and gasification reactions
deplete char particles [100–102], and consequently the bed volume
progressively shrinks. When the ignition front reaches the region near
the grate, almost all the volatile content in the fuel particles has already
been exhausted (Fig.  5-c). Therefore, the oxygen in the air is available
to react with residual char particle layers, and a new reaction front
forms. This new front travels cocurrent with the airflow, leaving ashes
in its way (Fig.  5-d).

The ignition front establishes a thermochemical boundary between
fresh particles and those that have started the combustion process by
entering the drying phase. This region is defined as the reaction zone.
Therefore, the ignition front serves as a reaction zone mobile border.

Fig. 5.  Description of the combustion process in an experimental fixed-bed.

Three graphs obtained from measurements during the experiment
describe the combustion behaviour of a fuel bed sample: temperature
history, mass variation, and flue gas composition. Despite the stochastic
nature of these profiles, their tendencies are conserved independent
of the fuel tested [69,103]. Indeed, Lenis et al. [71] evaluated the
repeatability of fixed-bed combustion experiments in a laboratory-scale
burner. By analysis of variance, they determined, with 95% reliability,
that the fixed-bed combustion parameters – ignition front propagation
velocity, burning rate, and stoichiometry – are repeatable.

In  the  following,  we  describe  each  of  these  three  characteristic
plots. Figs.  6, 7, and 8 show the results obtained from biomass residue
combustion experiments in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor [85,
104].

5.1. History of bed temperature

The ignition front generally arises on the fuel bed top and travels
downwards to the grate. The thermocouples at different heights along
the bed record the temperature variation at a fixed location as the
ignition front moves. This graph is defined as a history of the bed
temperature or temperature history. Fig.  6 shows the history of bed
temperature from sugarcane bagasse experimental data measured in a
laboratory-scale reactor [85]. Additionally, Fig.  6 presents the isother-
mal field as a function of time and position. In the graph, four regions,
defined as (a), (b), (c), and (d) divide the curves into vertical lines.
These indices correspond with those shown in Fig.  5 and indicate four
states of local combustion temperature at 180 mm above the grate.

When  the  reaction  zone  reaches  a  certain  layer  of  the  bed,  the
temperature of the particles in this region increases abruptly (state (a)).
The particles quickly passed through the drying and pyrolysis phases.
The volatiles released from the fuel particles, in a mixture with air,
reach their flammability temperature and ignite, increasing the local
temperature (state (b)). The isothermal lines in this phase have a con-
stant slope in the diagram of height vs. time, which indicates that the
ignition front propagates through the bed at a constant velocity (Fig.
6). The local temperature reaches a peak value when the bed surface
reaches the thermocouple. From this moment on, the thermocouple
is exposed to the reactor walls, which, along with the oxidant flow,
dissipate part of the heat released from the combustion of char particles
and  volatiles  [23,73,105–107].  Additionally,  some  char  particles  in
contact with the thermocouple undergo gasification reactions which
also contribute to local temperature reduction. Because of the heat dis-
sipation effect, which is also a consequence of the gasification reactions
of char particles in contact with CO2 and steam [22,74,100,108], the
local temperature decreases. However, the reactions of fuel particles in
the middle of the ignition front path reduce the intensity of the local

temperature variation (state (c)). When the ignition front reaches the
grate, the local temperature increases. This effect results from the high
oxygen availability, which consumes residual char particles left after all
volatile material is depleted [74,109,110]. The temperature decreases
when the combustible material present in the bed is not sufficient to
sustain a high temperature (state (d)). At this point, dissipative effects
prevail, cooling the reactor. As shown in the height vs. time plot (Fig.
6), the isothermal lines in this last phase are almost vertical because the
temperature is the same at all positions of the combustion chamber.

From the temperature history, it is possible to estimate the ignition

front propagation velocity as follows.

1. For each thermocouple inserted along the combustion chamber,
it is necessary to define any reference temperature (Tref ) during
the ignition phase (see Fig.  6). There are two approaches for
selecting Tref : (i) choosing any temperature inside the ignition
phase, and (ii) estimating the temperature inflection point (in
Fig.  6 this temperature is defined as ‘‘inf’’.), which is present in
the sharp change in the temperature profile.

2. To calculate the ratio of the distance between adjacent ther-
mocouples (Hi+1 − Hi) and the time when each thermocouple
registers Tref  is measured (t(Tref )i+1 − t(Tref )i).

3. Finally, the ignition front velocity vig is obtained by the average

of the ratios estimated in the previous step:

vig =

1
NT − 1

NT −1
∑

i=1

Hi+1 − Hi
t(Tref )i+1 − t(Tref )i

(1)

The  ignition  front  velocity  varies  along  each  bed  section  [108]
because  nonuniform  bed  porosity  affects  airflow  distribution  [71].
However, by taking the slope of the regression line formed by isother-
mal points in a position vs. time diagram, as shown in Fig.  6, it is
possible to reduce the deviation in vig.

An additional approach for vig estimation uses visual techniques
[83,111]. Polesek-Karczewska et al. [83] used a camera to take pictures
of the combustion process of poultry residues on a fixed-bed reactor.
Then, the authors decomposed each photograph pixel colour in its RGB
constituents with image processing software. Afterwards, they found
the position of the ignition front in the bed because, during combustion,
there is an intensity peak related to the red colour inside the reaction
zone. With the position of the ignition front during bed combustion, it
was possible to estimate vig. The velocities obtained using this method
and those estimated via thermocouple measurements converged [83].

With vig, the ignition rate,  ̇m′′

ig, is determined. The ignition rate
defines the mass swept by the ignition front during its propagation
along the bed, per unit of time and cross-sectional area of the bed [95].
̇m′′
ig is directly related to the bed’s release rate of volatile gases, also
called the pyrolysis rate [57]. The ignition rate is the result of the
product of the ignition front propagation velocity (vig) and the raw bed
bulk density (ρb):

̇m′′

ig = ρb vig

5.2. Bed mass variation

(2)

Fig.  7 shows a typical mass variation profile during a combustion
test. After bed ignition, there is a period in which the bed mass loss
rate (slope of the bed mass variation profile versus time) progressively
increases as the reactions associated with combustion reach their stable
state  [108,112,113].  After  transitory  effects,  the  bed  mass  linearly
decreases, indicating that the reaction zone moves at an average con-
stant velocity. The experimental conditions are established from this
moment, and the relevant measurements may be taken. Finally, when
almost all combustible material runs out, the slope of the curve slowly
decreases as the combustion extinguishes.

The  burning  rate,  ̇m′′

bur,  is  a  parameter  that  represents  the  mass
flux  released  as  a  result  of  fuel  combustion–gasification  reactions.
It  measures  the  instant  mass  deficit  along  the  bed.  Therefore,  ̇m′′
bur
includes  the  loss  of  mass  caused  by  moisture  vaporization,  volatile
release, char consumption, and fine particle entrainment. The burning
rate is estimated by Eq.  (3):

5.3. Flue gas composition

The data plotted in Fig.  8 correspond to measurements of the flue
gas composition taken over the bed in a laboratory-scale bed combus-
tion reactor [104]. Although the composition of flue gases is acquired
above the freeboard, away from the reaction zone, the temporal com-
position profiles obtained are like those obtained at a position within
the bed, as observed in various studies in the literature [68,114,115].
However, this similarity is consistent if the reaction zone advances
steadily towards the grate.

After bed ignition (or when the ignition front passes the gas sam-
pling port), the O2 level is very low. In contrast, the CO and CO2
concentrations increase, reaching a peak. These transitory events in-
dicate that the fuel layers enter in combustion. During the stable stage
of bed combustion, the CO and CO2 levels remain relatively uniform
until  the  ignition  front  reaches  the  grate  at  the  end  of  the  steady
phase. At this time, at approximately 375 s, as shown in Fig.  8, the
CO concentration increases with a small peak, and soon after the CO2
decreases because of char gasification reactions [63,116]:

C (s) + O2

C (s) + 1

(R1)

(R2)

When volatile gases are completely depleted from residual fuel par-
ticles, the O2 availability for char combustion increases. Consequently,
the CO level decreases to zero, and the CO2 concentration increases
until  it  reaches  a  last  maximum  before  it  decreases  to  zero  as  the
residual combustible material burns.

In the case of the NOx level, represented by the NO variation in Fig.

8, its graph has three representative features:

1. A  few  seconds  after  bed  ignition,  the  NO  content  increases
rapidly. For example, NOx precursors, HCN and NH3, are pro-
duced by volatilization and oxidized to form NO. When the O2
content decreases as the oxidation of volatiles consumes it, NO
acts as an oxidant according to reactions  to  [117–119] although

NO formation stops, and its concentration decreases. This be-
haviour can be observed in Fig.  8.

2. After the gas sampling point is immersed inside the reaction
zone, the NO level subsequently stabilizes, as do the HCN and
NH3 concentrations, as several authors have shown [114,121,
122].

3. When  the  ignition  front  arrives  at  the  grate,  the  reduction
in volatiles causes O2 availability to increase for char oxida-
tion. This event promotes NO production, and its concentration
reaches a maximum [121,122], as shown in Fig.  8. Finally, NO
formation stops along with the reactive-to-oxygen compounds in
char.

The variation in fixed-bed combustion stoichiometry with air flux
also affects NOx formation and destruction rates. Increasing the ig-
nition rate with increasing air flux increases the amount of volatile
material released in the reaction zone. Consequently, the level of NOx
precursor gases emitted from biomass, such as NH3, HCN, and NO,
increases [123]. Because bed combustion in the initial stages is carried
out under rich conditions, some combustible gases, such as CO, use
NO as an oxidant according to the reactions  to , as shown in Fig.  9.
However, further increases in the air flux increase the amount of O2
available to produce greater amounts of NOx, mainly NO [73,106,124],
by the side reaction , which is more important at temperatures above
950 ◦C:

4 NO + 6 H2O‘‘’’

(R8)

Techniques for reducing emissions ‘‘in situ’’ have been studied in
fixed-bed experimental systems that can be applied at an industrial
scale.  Archan  et  al.  [87]  investigated  the  effects  of  using  flue  gas
recirculation on the spatial distribution of gaseous species in an experi-
mental combustor, and were able to offer a detailed measurement of
gas composition that supported the use of such a strategy to utilize
fuels  with  high  water  fractions.  Polonini  et  al.  [125]  also  experi-
mentally  tested  flue  gas  recirculation,  which  resulted  in  reductions

9

in  CO,  particulate  matter  and  NOx  emissions  that  were  significant
enough to bring them under the strict thresholds dictated by the Italian
government, although as mixing was unregulated, controlled by the
pressure difference between the flue gas outlet pipe and the combustion
chamber, a system to measure and control the mix proportions could
result in further decreases. Some of these trends were confirmed by
CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations by Gómez et al. [126],
who implemented an FGR (flue gas recirculation) model in a domestic
boiler,  showing  a  noticeable  increase  in  heat  transferred  when  the
proportion of FGR increases and the oxygen excess is low. The FGR was
able to reduce NO emissions at low values of the excess oxygen ratio,
but the emissions increased significantly when oxygen was abundant.
The  average  value  of  the  concentration  of  any  gas  species  [X]
is  obtained  by  calculating  the  area  under  the  graph  (Fig.   8)  of  its
concentration versus time, and in relation to the total measurement
time:

[X] =

ttot

[x]dt

1
ttot

∫

(5)

where [x] is the concentration of the species at time t and where ttot is
the total time of data acquisition.

The flue gas composition allows us to determine which reactions
must be intensified to reduce unburnt fuel gases or the emission of
pollutants [107].

The properties defined above – the ignition rate, burning rate, and
mean  concentration  of  species  [X]  –  describe  the  behaviour  of  the
reaction zone during its displacement along the bed and characterize
the reactor performance. However, other essential characteristics allow
more profound insight into the fixed-bed combustion phenomenon to
set reference conditions for evaluating numerical models. Fig.  10 shows
some of these parameters together with those previously discussed.
These properties are defined as the reaction zone thickness, δ, maxi-
mum bed temperature, Tmax, particulate matter emission rate, particle
size, and bed packing characteristics.

Reaction zone thickness (δ).  The reaction zone is located where reac-
tions that support ignition front propagation along the bed occur [105,
127]. The ignition front and the cross-section with nonreacting parti-
cles, close to the bed’s top, limit the reaction zone (Fig.  10). Therefore,
inside this region the stoichiometry of fixed-bed combustion is deter-
mined by estimating the ratio between the air flux and the ignition rate:

[A∕F ] =

̇m′′
a
̇m′′
ig

(6)

where [A∕F ] represents the air-to-fuel ratio inside the reaction zone.

This region results from the difference between the ignition rate and
the burning rate [96,128]. Initially, fuel particles absorb heat from an

ignition source. Depending on factors such as the heat flow intensity
from the ignition source, bulk density, and air flux, the heat transferred
reaches a certain depth inside the bed. Those particles directly exposed
to the ignition source increase their temperature and go through drying
and pyrolysis stages. In some locations in the ignition source influence
zone,  the  mixture  of  combustible  gases  with  air  reaches  its  lower
flammability limit, and combustion begins. Additionally, the formed
char starts to burn. The heat released during combustion is transferred
downwards by radiation and conduction to fresh fuel particles out of
the ignition source influence zone [90]. The ignition front forms and
propagates hereafter, as explained in the above sections. Because the
char consumption rate is lower than the ignition rate, those particles
left behind from the ignition front continue the combustion process,
and a reaction zone is established. The reaction zone thickness depends
mainly on the oxidant flux and reaction kinetics.

Because the volume of fuel particles only shrinks during the char
consumption phase, it is possible to directly relate the bed top surface
displacement velocity with the char consumption rate. Therefore, from
the evolution of the reaction zone thickness, strategies to improve air-
flow distribution across the grate and reduce unburned-particle-related
combustion inefficiencies are possible [112].

There are challenges associated with measuring δ caused by dif-
ficulties in following the bed top surface position without affecting
the combustion process. Nevertheless, some authors have successfully
estimated this position experimentally [92,107,112,113]. Stubington
and Fenton [92] employed a graduated rod to directly measure the
bed top surface position during fixed-bed combustion experiments of
sugarcane residues. Porteiro et al. [112] used an articulated auxiliary
structure to monitor the bed height during experiments with wood
pellet samples allowing for the measurement of the position of the last
layer of the reaction front in a simple manner, but without making
further assumptions on the thickness of the front itself. Junejo et al.
[113] measured the bed level position with a hollow steel bar used
as  a  height  indicator  and  Yang  et  al.  [107]  estimated  δ  from  the
temperature history profile and ignition front velocity and reported that
the thickness of the reaction zone is almost an inverse linear function of
moisture, and that the devolatilization kinetics used do not significantly
influence the results.

Maximum bed temperature.  The literature reports that the maximum
temperatures observed in experimental fixed-bed biomass combustion
systems  are  usually  in  the  range  of  800  to  1300 ◦C,  depending  on
the biomass characteristics and the bed operating conditions, among
other factors. However, some biomass combustion effects that occur
at  temperatures  below  the  maximum  temperatures  are  of  technical
and environmental interest. For example, ashes produced during the
combustion of some types of biomass have low melting temperatures
because of the elevated presence of alkali compounds and chlorine.
These  compounds  partially  melt  or  even  vaporize  at  low  tempera-
tures  –  approximately  600 ◦C  [59]  –  during  combustion  and  react

10

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 109 (2025) 101233

on  burner  and  boiler  surfaces  to  form  deposits.  The  occurrence  of
ash-related problems can be controlled based on previous knowledge
of the composition of the inorganic compounds in the fuel and the
maximum temperature reached during combustion [129]. Because the
maximum combustion temperature is associated with the combustion
heat released, it is also used as a burner performance indicator.

Particulate matter.  One disadvantage of using fixed-bed burners is the
high emission of fine particles released from the fuel bed. The particles
released during solid fuel combustion are made of ashes, soot, and
char [130]. The impact that particulate matter has on the integrity
of equipment, health, and the environment are extensively discussed
in  the  literature  [59].  The  significance  of  PM  (particulate  matter)
emissions  lies  in  their  capacity  to  penetrate  the  respiratory  system
and reach the alveoli, posing a threat to human health [131]. This is
particularly dangerous for the finer fractions, such as particles smaller
than 2.5 μ m (PM2.5) [132]. The established correlation between PM
and adverse health conditions is well documented, with PM posing
a heightened risk to specific vulnerable groups, including the elderly
and those with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory conditions.
While differences in the diagnosis techniques and evaluation between
countries exist, it is estimated that 3%–5% of cardiopulmonary deaths
could be attributed to PM [133,134].

Like estimating the reaction zone thickness, diverse methodologies
are used to quantify the particulate matter emitted during a fixed-bed
combustion test, such as isokinetic sampling with a suction probe, im-
pactors (cascade, electrical low-pressure and others), and filters [135].
Nevertheless, the potential impact of a fuel bed on the release of partic-
ulate matter is related to the emission rate. This parameter represents
the mass of particles emitted in flue gases over either the initial mass
of fuel or the net energy liberated during the test [77]. A study on
emission factors in biomass combustion showed that values obtained
at the laboratory scale can be relatively higher than those obtained via
measurements in combustors and woodstoves [136]. On an industrial
scale, the path taken by combustion gases that carry particulate matter
usually has obstacles that serve as collectors of part of this solid mate-
rial (heat exchange tubes, refractories, etc.). However, experiments in
laboratory fixed-bed burners provide important information about the
formation and characteristics of particulate matter.

Few experimental studies have aimed to investigate the formation of
particulate emissions during biomass combustion in fixed-bed burners.
Among these work, the contributions of Wiinikka and collaborators
stand out [75,137–139]. They investigated the evolution of the partic-
ulate matter released during the combustion of different wood samples
in an experimental fixed-bed reactor with a staged air supply. They
discovered the critical role of fuel composition and the burner’s op-
erational conditions in forming the fine particle mode — with a size
smaller than 2.5 μm. Unlike entrained particles, fine particles are of
primary concern because their small size prevents their separation from
flue gases by conventional systems [75]. Their formation depends on
the fuel used in the bed, as noted by Mantananont and Patumsawad
[77] and Sommersacher et al. [140], who noted the relationship be-
tween these particles and sulphur and chlorine deposits, as well as
the  effects  of  fuel  blending.  Reducing  the  char  temperature  at  bed
level and increasing the mixture rate in the secondary oxidation zone
reduced the quantity of particulate matter present during the wood
sample combustion test [75,122]. However, in fixed-bed combustion
tests of wood carried out by Pettersson et al. [141] in an experimental
reactor without a staged air supply, the particulate matter emissions
were unaffected by the bed temperature.

Particle size and bed packing characteristics.  The phenomena associated
with the combustion of a solid particle are surface phenomena. The
size, shape, and density of a fuel particle affect its consumption time.
However,  packing  properties  –  size  distribution,  bulk  density,  and
porosity – also influence the combustion of a fixed bed of particles.

H.A. Martinez–Sarache et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 109 (2025) 101233

Because the individual and group physical characteristics of the par-
ticles are closely related, it is impossible to study the effect of one
parameter separately without affecting the others [142]. Additionally,
because fuel particles are nonuniform in shape and size, it is necessary
to describe the bed particle population by a particle size distribution
and an estimator of that distribution [143].

At  the  individual  particle  level,  its  size  depends  on  the  shape
of the particle. Therefore, a characteristic dimension is defined. For
example, the length depicts slender and cylindrical particles; in the
case of flattened particles, a particle diameter (dp) is usually the best
choice. Different definitions of dp include hydraulic diameter, surface
diameter, sieve diameter, and surface-volume diameter or Sauter diam-
eter (dsv). Hallett et al. [144] simulated the fixed-bed combustion of
commercial hardwood charcoal using different particle diameter defi-
nitions to describe the bed. Compared with the experimental data, the
numerical results revealed that dsv is the most suitable parameter for
representing the particle diameter in models of processes that include
surface chemical reactions.

The following equation is used to calculate the Sauter diameter:

where, dv is the particle volume diameter – the diameter of a sphere
with a similar volume to the particle – and where ds is the surface

At the bed scale, the nature of the phenomena carried out between
solid particles and the surrounding gases are related to porosity (φ). φ
is the ratio between the volume of the voids in the bed and the total
bed volume and is expressed in terms of the particle density (ρp) and
bulk density (ρb):

In the next section, we discuss the effects of varying the dominant

operating parameters on fixed-bed combustion.

6. Effect of the most influential operational factors on fixed-bed
combustion

6.1. Effect of oxidant medium

The mass flux of an oxidant medium, such as air ( ̇m′′

a ), is the most
influential parameter during bed combustion. In conjunction with the
ignition front, the oxidant medium controls the stoichiometry inside
the reaction zone. Its variation impacts the stability and propagation
of the bed’s reaction zone and the formation of pollutant compounds
(for instance, NOx). These effects on bed combustion behaviour depend
on the composition of the oxidant medium and the dynamics of its flow
through the bed. For a given oxidant medium, the oxygen availability
affects the energy released during the combustion of volatile material
and char particles. The mass flux of the oxidant controls this availabil-
ity. However, this parameter induces a convective effect that dissipates
the heat from combustion. Thus, reaction front propagation results from
the net heat transferred to every fuel particle in layers near the reaction
zone.

Various studies have reported the influence of the thermodynamic
state (temperature and composition) and the oxidant medium’s flow
dynamics (superficial velocity) on fixed-bed combustion. Their results
show that the reaction zone may present different behaviours depend-
ing on the combination of these parameters. The following sections
present the most discussed effects of the oxidant medium on fixed-bed
combustion:

Regardless of the fuel used in the bed, the ignition and burning
rates show similar trends with variations in the oxidant flux rate. Fig.
11 illustrates this behaviour. Additionally, this behaviour has been ob-
served in oxidizing media other than air, such as mixtures of CO2 with
O2 [101] and mixtures of N2 with different concentrations of O2 [145].
The similarity observed in each fuel allows for the identification that
the combustion process takes place in different regimes depending on
the magnitude of the oxidant medium flow rate supplied. These regimes
also set boundaries inside which bed reactions occur. Each of these
regimes and their main characteristics are discussed in the following
paragraphs.

Oxygen-limited regime.  The first regime arises for very low air flux, but
with enough oxygen available to sustain a flammable mixture with
volatile gases [57,105]. Under these conditions, the volatiles released
stay close to the fuel particles and maintain a cloud around them. The
gases start combustion in those particle bed layers near the ignition
front. The slow reaction kinetics and insufficient mixture of pyrolysis
gases and oxygen induce combustion under very rich conditions [146];
therefore, a significant portion of the volatiles leave the bed without
reacting [58,106,127]. The reactions concentrate the released heat near
the ignition front, supporting its propagation along the bed but under
transitory  conditions.  Over  the  ignition  front,  a  layer  of  unburned
particles builds up [92,105], but only a fraction receives heat from
the  ignition  front.  These  particles  react  slowly,  mainly  by  gasifica-
tion [58,106,146]. Since  ̇m′′
bur in this layer of particles is much lower
than vig (Fig.  12), the reaction zone thickness continually increases
until the ignition front reaches the bottom of the bed [92,147]. Some
authors define this transitory phase as gasification with incomplete con-
sumption of oxygen [57,58,127,146]. Pérez et al. [148] designated this
combustion as a smouldering process because heterogeneous reactions
rule and sustain the combustion of the bed.

Increasing the air flux increases the oxygen availability and the
reaction and heat release rates [127,149]; additionally, the combustion
temperature, ignition rate, and burning increase. Hence, the growth
of the reaction zone thickness decreases. A new transition to another
regime arises when the reaction rate exceeds the oxygen supply rate.
Under these conditions, all the oxygen in the reaction zone is wholly
consumed in the bed. This transition was defined by Rönnbäck et al.
[58] as gasification with complete oxygen consumption. The reaction
rate increases with increasing oxygen availability in the two transitions
previously described.

1. We present the effect of the mass flux of the oxidant for a given

composition and temperature, specifically, air.

2. The effects of the oxidant medium temperature are noted.
3. The influence of the oxidant medium composition is discussed.

Reaction-limited regime.  At a higher air flux, the oxygen availability
within the reaction zone and the convective dissipation rate of the
air stream increase [149]. Depending on the fuel properties and bed
characteristics, two situations can occur.

ig and  ̇m′′

- The second situation occurs when the convective dissipation rate
reaches the reaction rate before the latter reaches its maximum.
In this case, although  ̇m′′
bur increase with increasing air
flux, the reaction zone unstably propagates through the bed. Like
in the first case, increasing the reaction zone propagation rates
requires an even higher air flux, but as  ̇m′′
bur are different,
the reaction zone thickness continues to increase, and material
accumulates before the ignition front reaches the grate. Khor et al.
[96] observed this behaviour during the combustion of straw and
switchgrass samples in an experimental fixed-bed reactor (Fig.
12). This unstable propagation of the ignition front was caused by
the physical shape of the feedstocks causing a marked channelling
effect due to the fibrous nature of the material, lowering the
burning rates.

ig and  ̇m′′

In both situations, fixed-bed combustion is limited by the maximum
reaction rate and the convective dissipation rate [127]. This regime
is present until the ignition and burning rates reach their maximum
values. In this case, the release of heat and convective dissipation rates
are balanced [152].

Extinction regime.  The critical air flux ( ̇m′′
a,cr) is a parameter defined as
the air flux rate at which the ignition and burning rates reach their
maxima, which limits the fixed-bed combustion efficiency.

When the air flux is greater than  ̇m′′

a,cr, the intensity of heat release
is lower than the convective dissipation rate. Therefore, the airstream
cools the char particles and drags the volatile flame away from the
bed [148]. At some air fluxes, the temperature of the reaction zone
is very low, and the combustion extinguishes. Conversely, because the
volatility  of  some  elements  in  the  ashes  decreases  with  decreasing
temperature, the deposition on the burner surfaces caused by inorganic
vapour condensation diminishes [155]. This is known as the extinction
regime [66,69].

The combustion regime profile for a fixed bed, as shown in Fig.
12  depends  on  fuel  properties,  such  as  particle  geometry,  thermal
degradation  kinetics,  and  bed  characteristics  [57,107,142,148,157].
Fig.  12, shows that both the height – defined by the maximum ignition
rate – and the graph width differ from one fuel to another.

Fig.  13 shows the variation in the ignition rate with the air flux
for some experimental results reported in the literature. To facilitate
interpretation of the data, given that the shape of the curve is similar
to that of  ̇m′′
ig, the variation in the burning rate is excluded from Fig.
13. This figure also presents the change in bed stoichiometry with the
air flux. The excess air ratio (λ) in Fig.  13 was estimated from the
ratio between the stoichiometric ignition rate and the experimentally
measured ignition rate:

- The first case occurs when the reaction rate reaches a maximum
before the convective effect of the airflow is of the same mag-
ig and  ̇m′′
nitude. In this situation,  ̇m′′
bur are approximately similar;
therefore, the reaction zone stably travels along the bed holding
its thickness (Fig.  12) [150]. This situation is characterized by the
absence of the char burning stage after the ignition front reaches
the bed bottom [151–153]. As its velocity increases, the reaction
zone narrows at higher air fluxes. However, the increase in  ̇m′′
ig
and  ̇m′′
bur with increasing air flux is lower than that observed in
the oxygen-limited regime. This trend continues until the ignition
and burning rates reach their maximum values when the reaction
zone thickness is minimized [154]. Fig.  12 shows this behaviour.

As shown in Fig.  13, at low air fluxes, in the region where  ̇m′′
ig
proportionally increases with air flux, the bed stoichiometry behaviour
remains almost uniform. However, in the reaction-limited regime, even
though  ̇m′′
ig continues to increase, bed combustion evolves under in-
creasingly less rich conditions. Experimental results have shown that
the reaction zone thickness controls the bed stoichiometry, which is
similarly governed by the char consumption rate [66]. In the oxygen-
limited regime, the increase in  ̇m′′
bur, regulates the bed
stoichiometry, keeping it roughly uniform under very rich conditions.
As the air flux increases, the char consumption rate increases, affecting
the reaction zone thickness, which decreases [158]. Because the char
inside  the  reaction  zone  decreases,  more  oxygen  escapes  from  the
bed  without  reacting,  and  consequently,  combustion  is  carried  out

Fig. 13.  Effects of the air flux and excess air ratio on the ignition rate for several fuels
in a fixed bed: straw [96]; pine and wood pellets [66]; high-temperature coke [154];
and refuse derived fuel (RDF) [156]. Data has been corrected to remove the effect of
moisture. The upper and lower plots present the same data.

under stoichiometric conditions. This effect is more substantial in the
reaction-limited regime and increases quickly in the extinction regime.
Fig.  13 also shows that the fuels develop their maximum ignition
rates under substoichiometric conditions in the regime controlled by
the reaction. Beyond this point, the excess air ratio of bed reaction zone
increases rapidly while bed combustion enters the extinction regime
(see Fig.  14). However, the ignition rate slightly varies in the case of
coke combustion, which has a lower volatile content than other fuels
(see Fig.  13). During the two initial combustion regimes, the level of CO
is high. This level progressively decreases as the airflow rate supplied
to the bed increases [65,147,152,153,159]; in contrast, the average
concentration of CO2 in flue gas can reach a stable value [73], even
under substoichiometric conditions. Finally, before the air flux reaches
the extinction point, which stops combustion, CO2 levels drop rapidly
because of the extinction of the reaction zone.

As  shown  in  Fig.   13,  the  ignition  rates  of  some  fuels,  such  as
wood pellets and high-temperature coke, are stable within the limits
of the reaction-limited regime and part of the extinction regime. This
behaviour contrasts with the straw ignition rate profile in this figure.
Fig.  15 correlates the maximum ignition rate with the critical excess
air ratio (λcr) of some fuels in experimentally fixed-bed reactors along
with the ratio between their initial contents of volatile material and
fixed carbon (VM/FC). λcr is defined by the critical air flux. This figure
reveals a positive correlation between the volatile-material and fixed-
carbon content ratios and the maximum ignition rate. Furthermore,
there is a negative trend between this critical value and the corre-
sponding excess air ratio (critical excess air ratio). Fuels with a higher
volatile  content  are  more  reactive  and  release  more  energy  in  less

time, requiring lower air flux than fuels with more fixed carbon [157].
However,  these  fuels  experience  flame  instabilities  during  reactions
after  they  reach  ̇m′′
a,cr.  In  contrast,  as  the  content  of  fixed  carbon
increases, it is necessary to increase the air flux to reach the maximum
ignition rate (Fig.  15), and there is high stability in the region limited
by the reaction-limited and extinction regimes. In practice, working
with  fuels  with  a  stable  reaction  rate  close  to  its  maximum  value,
close to the maximum ignition and consumption rate, is desirable. The
combustion of these fuels offers resilience to fluctuations inherent in
boiler operation, such as variations in airflow and fuel feed rates [150].
Fuels with very variable  ̇m′′
bur, such as agricultural residues,
including straw and pine pellets in Fig.  13, might require robust control
of the primary air supply under the grate. Therefore, co-combustion
with solid fuels with higher fixed carbon contents is recommended to
properly integrate agricultural residues in thermal energy generation
systems. In this way, problems associated with flame instabilities may
be reduced.

ig and  ̇m′′

Nevertheless,  the  burning  of  agricultural  residues  around  ̇m′′
a,cr
presents  many  challenges  because  of  the  relatively  high  tempera-
tures. This condition increases the risk of presenting issues related to
the deposition of inorganic material on burner heat transfer surfaces
because  of  the  high  concentrations  of  alkalis  and  chlorine  in  this
type of biomass [75,160]. Additionally, given the increased oxygen
availability because of high airflow rates, when biomass combustion
occurs between the regimes controlled by reaction and extinction, the
production of NO and the amount of entrained particles out of the bed
increase [161,162].

6.1.2. Staged air combustion

Some work have studied the effect of air flux on fixed-bed combus-
tion with staged air and continuous fuel feeding [163]. These studies
experimentally demonstrated the existence of a combination of primary
and secondary air flows that enhance biomass combustion behaviour.
The  combination  maintains  substoichiometric  conditions  in  the  bed
region and supplies enough secondary air to burn the fuel gases that
escape from the bed. Fixing the stoichiometric conditions in the bed
region and increasing the total airflow rate by supplying more sec-
ondary air allows the burning rate in the bed to increase [158]. As
discussed previously, when a fixed-bed burns with only primary air,
the convective dissipation effect of the airflow limits the ignition and
burning rates. Conversely, during bed combustion with staged air, the
secondary combustion region has high oxygen availability to burn the
excess volatile material and reduce soot production [164]. The heat
released during gas combustion offsets the heat dissipated from the
bed by primary airflow. The excess heat gained in the bed increases
the ignition and burning rates in the bed’s reaction zone. However,
as Junejo et al. [86] reported, the secondary air inlet port position plays
an essential role in exploiting the positive effects of staged air. In this
study, positioning the secondary air inlet closer to the fuel bed and
utilizing a larger proportion of the secondary air flow rate with respect
to  the  primary  air  flow  rate  significantly  decreased  CO  emissions.
Nevertheless, exceeding certain limits, convective cooling can provoke
sudden decreases in temperature that lead to incomplete combustion,
increasing CO emissions. Pérez-Orozco et al. [165] suggested that the
adequate positioning of the secondary air inlet could lead to lower
pollutant emission after performing fixed-bed combustion experiments
with fuels of commercial and non-commercial origin, indicating that
the  results  are  not  fuel  dependent  [165,166].  According  to  the  ex-
perimental results of Junejo et al. [86], there is a maximum distance
between the bed level and the secondary air inlet beyond which the
burning rate, ignition front velocity, and bed temperature decrease.

14

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 109 (2025) 101233

With respect to nitrogen oxide emissions, Houshfar and collabo-
rators reported that fuel-N conversion to NO is reduced under sub-
stoichiometric  conditions  in  the  bed  region  and  overstoichiometric
conditions in the secondary air zone. This effect is due to the low excess
air ratio in the bed and the high residence time of gases evolving from
the bed to the secondary zone, as previously explained [76,124,167].
Furthermore, lower combustion temperatures in the bed within the
regime limited by oxygen diminish the formation of inorganic vapours
and the amount of entrained char and ash particles [60,75,161,162].
However, for a given fuel or a fuel mixture, to optimize the opera-
tional behaviour of fixed-bed combustion, it is necessary to investigate
flue  gas  variation  as  a  function  of  primary  and  secondary  air  rate
combinations.

6.1.3. Air preheating temperature

Preheating  the  oxidant  medium  increases  the  amount  of  energy
released from the fuel. This effect occurs because of the reduction in
the sensible thermal load of the oxidant medium, which is required
to lead the fuel–oxygen mixture to its ignition temperature. Therefore,
the reactions are intensified together with  ̇m′′
bur, and reaction zone
temperature during fixed-bed combustion [108,168].

ig,  ̇m′′

Studies on air preheated as the oxidant medium show two combus-
tion behaviours that depend on the fuel pyrolysis temperature [169]. In
the first case, the air is preheated to temperatures much lower than the
fuel pyrolysis temperature. When air enters the bed, it transfers heat to
the fuel layers closest to the grate, drying the fuel particles. This effect
propagates upwards along the bed as a drying front. Nevertheless, the
air stream temperature decreases, and its moisture increases due to heat
and mass transfer with fuel particles [91]. The preheating temperature,
fuel moisture content, and bed height may negatively affect the bed
combustion performance. van Kessel et al. [91] reported that when
highly  moist  fuels  burn  in  a  moving  grate  reactor,  some  moisture
transported by air may condense in intermediate bed layers, delaying
ignition front propagation. The negative impact of preheating is present
only before drying and ignition fronts intercept during their propa-
gation. This phenomenon was also reported by Vorotinskien ̇e et al.
[170], who simulated the drying process during biomass-packed-bed
combustion experiments at different air flow preheating temperatures.
This research also offers further insight into the positive effects that
FGR can have on achieving stable and sustained flame propagation in
fuel while utilizing diverse mechanisms coupled with thermal radiation
to dry samples. After preheating, a sharp increase in the ignition rate,
and the previously dried fuel layers ignite rapidly. van Kessel et al. [91]
defined this effect as total combustion.

The second situation occurs when the air preheating temperature is
close to the fuel pyrolysis temperature, which is between approximately
230 and 250 ◦C [169]. As in the first case, a drying front propagates up-
wards. The air stream continues to heat the particles remaining behind
the drying front until they reach the pyrolysis temperature. Afterwards,
an upwards travelling devolatilization front appears. The layers on the
grate ignite, and an ignition front propagates upwards. Some authors
have defined this type of fixed-bed combustion as upwards combustion
[68,171]. Among the advantages of upwards combustion, we have the
following.

1. Drying and pyrolysis stage separation from bed combustion. This
effect causes the propagation of the reaction zone along the bed
to be less dependent on the heterogeneity of the particles [68,
171]. The volatile gases that escape from the bed may be burned
by the addition of secondary air.

2. Because of the fuel layers over the reaction zone, there is more
resistance  to  the  combustion  gases  flowing  through  the  bed,
therefore, reducing the emission of entrained particles, as re-
ported by Markovic et al. [68]

H.A. Martinez–Sarache et al.

.

Despite the advantages of fixed-bed upwards combustion, such as
the decoupling of drying, devolatilization and combustion phases, the
moisture content of the fuel does not influence the overall combustion
process, and this type of combustion tends to be uncontrollable when
air is used as an oxidant because of the high levels of volatile gases
produced. To avoid this effect, Markovic et al. [68] recommended the
use of a mixture of air and recirculated flue gases. This could further
reduce fouling due to lower ash blowout and reduce NOx emissions
due to the lower availability of oxygen in the upper sections of the
facility. However, as there are few work in the literature concerning
this phenomenon, more studies are needed to implement this technique
in biomass combustion in fixed-bed reactors.

6.1.4. Oxidant medium composition

There are few work in the literature concerning the effect of oxidant
medium composition on biomass combustion in fixed-bed laboratory-
scale reactors. Nonetheless, these studies address two main themes:
NOx  reduction  [123,172]  and  combustion  behaviour  [173].  In  this
section, we discuss the latter topic.

The combustion behaviour of the fuel bed is sensitive to the oxy-
gen concentration and thermal properties of the gases that constitute
the  oxidant  medium.  Meng  et  al.  [145]  conducted  combustion  ex-
periments  on  poplar  sawdust  in  a  fixed-bed  reactor  using  different
oxygen–nitrogen mixtures as the oxidant medium. They reported that
the reaction zone temperature and combustion efficiency increase with
the oxygen level in the oxidant medium. In a similar manner, Tanui
et al. [101] evaluated the effects of atmospheres composed of CO2 and
O2 mixtures on the propagation of the reaction zone during wood com-
bustion. The measured reaction zone temperatures and the estimated
ignition rates were lower than those observed when air was used as
the oxidant medium. This effect is due to the specific heat of inert
gases in the oxidant medium (CO2 has a higher specific heat than
N2 at temperatures greater than 600 K). The introduction of nitrogen
to the oxidizer mixture can also affect the outcome of combustion,
as  shown  by  Jaganathan  et  al.  [174],  who  conducted  combustion
experiments on beds of agro-industrial waste pellets burned in oxidizing
environments  consisting  of  mixtures  of  oxygen  with  CO2  or  N2  at
different concentrations. The authors reported that the ignition front
experienced instabilities in its propagation when the oxygen content
exceeded 42% by volume. Under these conditions, the ignition front
propagates discontinuously, ‘‘jumping’’ to deeper layers of fresh fuel
while leaving behind particles still undergoing pyrolysis. The authors
define this phenomenon as ‘‘flame jump’’ and highlight its negative
implications for biomass gasification systems.

These results highlight the importance of the composition of the
oxidizing medium in the combustion of biomass in fixed-bed reactors.
However, it is necessary to explore this phenomenon further, especially
with respect to residual biomass, because of its highly heterogeneous
properties and relevant role as a future fuel source for heat generation.
Flue  gas  recirculation  is  one  of  the  most  utilized  strategies  for
reducing NOx emissions from biomass boilers. As biofuels are prone to
have a greater proportion of molecule-bound nitrogen than coal does
in their composition, their combustion often leads to comparatively
higher levels of nitrogen oxides. By substituting part of the intake air
flow for chimney gas, the availability of oxygen in the reaction zone
is reduced, limiting the formation of thermal NOx due to temperature
control, and fuel-NOx due to the increased presence of carbon diox-
ide [172]. Pérez-Orozco et al. [175] linked the use of this strategy
in an 18 kW laboratory-scale facility to notable reductions in CO and
particulate matter (PM) emissions, although some limitations in the
measurement of nitrogen oxides are recognized, as the low proportion
of fuel-nitrogen implies that, owing to the relatively lower tempera-
tures reached inside the combustion chamber, not enough nitrogen is
available to be released as oxides. This opens the possibility that this
strategy leads to higher NOx emissions in nitrogen-rich fuels such as

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 109 (2025) 101233

agricultural or municipal waste. The combination of this strategy with
oxy-fuel combustion can achieve very low CO and NO concentrations,
as shown in the work of Sung et al. [176]. In oxy-fuel combustion a
mixture of O2 and CO2 is used as an oxidizer with the aim of achieving
an almost pure CO2 stream on the flue gas, allowing techniques such as
carbon sequestration to be more effective. This strategy has proven to
be effective in reducing PM emissions in fixed-bed systems, as indicated
in the studies by Wang et al. [177], who focused their research on the
alteration of the environmental conditions of combustion to study its
effects on PM release. With this approach, the authors concluded that
an increase in temperature is conducive to lowering PM levels in the
devolatilization phase of the reaction, whereas for char combustion an
increase in temperature is linked to higher PM emissions.

Another possibility has been gaining traction in the last few years,
consisting of the substitution of N2 or CO2 for H2O, so-called oxy-steam
combustion. This technique is well studied in the field of coal, although
biomass-centred studies can also be found in smaller numbers. Díez
et al. [178] studied the effects of including up to 40% H2O in the
combustion of torrefied biomass on its own and blending with coal and
reported that 25% H2O was the optimum point for NO reduction and
maximization of the degree of conversion. This confirms the findings
of Li et al. [179], where the total substitution of N2 by H2O resulted
in an acceleration of the burning rate of the feedstocks and reduced
NO  emissions.  Other  studies  performed  with  alternative,  low-grade
biofuels such as vine pruning or corn waste are in line with these
findings, suggesting that while the presence of H2O has a noticeable
effect on nitrogen oxides, it does not influence the release of CO and
CO2 [180,181].

6.2. Effects of particle size and bed physical properties

The combustion of a single particle depends on its characteristics,
such as size, density, shape, and physical properties. Conversely, when
a group of particles burns together, as in packed-bed combustion, the
extent of the particle arrangement in the bed also governs the com-
bustion behaviour. This influence overlaps with the effects of a single
particle’s properties. Consequently, difficulties arise in distinguishing
the impact of individual and packing properties on the combustion of
beds composed of particles with different geometric characteristics.

Despite the limitations caused by the strong relationships between
individual particle dimensions and packed-bed properties, various au-
thors have achieved significant results regarding the effect of particle
geometry variation on fixed-bed combustion behaviour. In this section,
we first present the effects of the fuel particle size distribution. The
effects of the packing parameters on the porosity and bulk density are
subsequently discussed.

6.2.1. Bed’s particle size distribution effect

ig and  ̇m′′

One of the main effects of increasing fuel particle size on fixed-bed
combustion behaviour is the reduction in  ̇m′′
bur, as shown in
Fig.  16. For a given airflow rate, in beds composed of larger particles,
because of the internal temperature gradients, each fresh fuel particle
inside the reaction zone increases its temperature more slowly than in
beds of small particles; consequently, the particles go through drying
and pyrolysis stages at low rates. As the bed particle size increases,
the  availability  of  oxygen  supplied  by  the  air  supply  increases  in
relation to the surface area available for heat and mass transfer. This
phenomenon reduces the amounts of combustible gases emitted from
the bed [92,159,182,183] (Fig.  17) and the levels of entrained bed
particles, but this condition promotes a reduction in the reaction zone
temperature [69]. Therefore, the ignition rate is reduced.

An  internal  reaction  front  forms  inside  each  particle  while  the
ignition front propagates along the bed. Because  ̇m′′
bur is lower than
̇m′′
ig, during bed combustion, the reaction zone thickness increases along
with the residual char particles until the end of the process [184]. Addi-
tionally, because oxygen availability increases with increasing particle

size, more fuel-N is converted to NO [183,185]. In some cases, when
the bed is composed of large particles, the whole fixed-bed combustion
process is fragmented, resulting in the isolated combustion of each
particle [92].

6.2.2. Bed packing properties effect

During fixed-bed combustion of uniformly packed particles with the
same density (ρp), the heat released from the reaction zone reaches
fresh particles by radiation. In beds with high porosity, the radiated
heat may travel long distances, so the reaction zone thickness is greater
than that observed in low porosity beds [100,173]. Under these con-
ditions, the heat intensity received by every particle in close layers
decreases. Thus, the ignition and burning rates are lower in bulky beds
than in more compact beds [57,69,99,186], as shown in Fig.  18-(a).

Bed porosity also affects the fixed-bed combustion range of useable
airflow rates, i.e., the range of airflow rate values within which the
reaction takes place (Fig.  18-(a)). In beds of small particles, because
combustion reactions are more intense due to the higher surface area
and lower porosity, large amounts of volatiles are released quickly. Fig.
17 shows the strong influence of particle size on CO emission. Hence,
for a fixed airflow rate, the reaction zone excess air ratio is lower than
that observed in beds of larger particles with higher porosity [142].
The porosity reduction in the bed reduces the airflow rate required to
quench the bed (Fig.  18-(a)).

Different  behaviours  occur  during  fixed-bed  combustion  experi-
ments of thin-light particles such as straw, leaves, and grasses [65,92].
As shown in Fig.  18-(b) and (c), the ignition rate is higher in beds
with lower ρb (higher porosity) at a fixed airflow rate. Some authors
attributed this effect to channelling. Channelling is the consequence
of an uneven distribution of particle size that forms interconnected
spots of high local porosity [144,187], mainly near reactor walls [164],
which serve as shortcuts for air and gas flow. Because the airflow rate
is higher at these locations, combustion reactions are more intense,
and temperature variation along the bed cross-section is considered.
This  phenomenon  increases  the  ignition  front  speed,  which  rapidly
reaches the grate even when the particles are under ignition [94–96].
However, the burning rate has been shown to be unaffected by the
abrupt increase in  ̇m′′
ig, as Khor et al. [96] noted. Beds composed of
untreated fuel particles exhibit the above effects. For example, Zhou
et al. [65] (Fig.  18-(c)), Milijković [64] and Khor et al. [96] used long
straw fibres in their experiments. The wide heterogeneity among bed
particles establishes nonuniform packing, which enables channelling to
occur [96].

Tanui et al. [173] reported a similar effect of bed porosity on the
ignition  front  in  beds  composed  of  fine  wood  particles  (wood  and

sawdust). These results are interesting because the beds studied by
Tanui and collaborators presented higher bulk density values – between
390 and 597 kg m−3 – than did the biomasses previously discussed (see
Fig.  18). This increase in  ̇m′′
ig peaked for a defined critical bed porosity.
Beyond this critical bed porosity, the ignition rate decreases [173] be-
cause of the increase in the convective dissipative effect. Nevertheless,
more studies are needed to gain complete insight into the effect of bed
porosity on fixed-bed performance.

Fig.  18-(b) and (c) also show that although  ̇m′′

ig decreases with in-
creasing ρb, combustion is more stable than untreated biomass particles
are. When the biomass particle size is homogenized by size reduction,

particles. The first group includes most agricultural residues, such as
straw, leaves, and grasses; the latter consists of particles with either
cubic,  cylindrical,  or  semispherical  shapes,  such  as  coal  and  wood
particles. In beds composed of particles from both groups, stable and
resilient combustion can be obtained [142,188]. From a bed property
perspective, to harness the high availability and energy potential of
agricultural residues, co-combustion with the biomass of the second
group is a promising option.

6.3. Moisture content effect

The data plotted in Figs.  19 and 20 correspond to the experimental
results of fixed-bed combustion with air supplied at room temperature.
For a fixed airflow rate, increasing the fuel moisture level slows both
̇m′′
ig  and  ̇m′′
bur,  which  increases  the  reaction  time.  This  effect  occurs
because the energy required to dry each particle in the bed reaction
zone increases, which reduces its heating rate to reach the ignition
temperature [107,152].

The moisture level effect is more intense in  ̇m′′

bur, as
shown in Fig.  20. This effect on both parameters suggests that the
reaction  zone  thickness  decreases  as  the  moisture  level  of  the  fuel
particles increases. Hence, an increase in moisture promotes the char
consumption rate during the stable propagation phase of the reaction
zone [107,168,189]. This effect can be explained as follows: the particle

the likelihood of channelling formation decreases. Additionally, a uni-
form particle size allows a better distribution of the airflow in the
bed. In this way, the ignition front stably propagates along the bed.
However, the type of solid fuel, as shown in Fig.  18-(b) and (c), is
characterized by a low density (ρp). Therefore, the positive effects of
particle size reduction are considerable above some limit size of the
particle. Below this dimension, losses by particle entrainment may be
significant enough to affect the fixed-bed combustion efficiency.

In general, as shown in Fig.  18, bed porosity (or bulk density) may
affect fixed-bed combustion in two ways, each of which depends on the
configuration and density of fuel particles: (1) thin light and (2) coarse

heating rate influences its pyrolysis rate. The pyrolysis rate affects both
ig and  ̇m′′
̇m′′
bur; however the former is more sensitive to this parameter
variation [69,107]. At a fixed airflow rate, lower amounts of volatile
gases increase oxygen availability to consume the char formed dur-
ing the stable propagation phase of the reaction zone, as illustrated
in Fig.  21. As the moisture level of the fuel particles increases, the
reaction zone becomes thinner, and there is less residual char in the
last fixed-bed combustion phase [107]. Consequently, the reaction zone
propagates along the bed more stably, and the amount of unburnt gases
evolving out of the bed decreases.

The reduction in the pyrolysis rate with increasing moisture level
also affects the combustion regime region of the bed. As reported in
both experimental [150] and numerical results [152], the critical air
flux for drier fuels is greater than that observed for wetter fuels. Ad-
ditionally, the useable air flux range decreases as the moisture content
increases. Then, a wetter fuel reaches extinction at lower  ̇m′′
a .

The fuel moisture level reduces the reaction zone temperature be-
cause a higher thermal load is required to evaporate the water and heat
the steam released [189]. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Fig.  22, the
maximum combustion temperature (Tmax) is unaltered at low moisture
levels when the moisture content varies from 20%–30% [69,107,150].
At a relatively high moisture level, the maximum combustion tempera-
ture in the reaction zone decreases until the humidity reaches a certain
level. From that level, Tmax remains unaltered up to a high humidity
level such that combustion is unsustainable. Because char and volatiles
react in a narrower region, those reactions counterbalance the heat
consumed by the moisture, keeping the temperature roughly constant.
Fuel  moisture  limits  the  combustion  performance  because  it  in-
creases the latent and sensible energy demands of water and extends
the total combustion time. However, experimental evidence has demon-
strated that fixed-bed combustion of highly wet fuels occurs under sta-
ble temperatures and reaction front propagation conditions. This effect
can be beneficial for combusting highly humid fuels such as agricultural
residues and municipal solid waste in fixed-bed combustion reactors.
These types of fuels are continuously produced throughout the year at
low costs. The availability of these fuels may offset moisture-related en-
ergy loss to produce inexpensive and environmentally friendly thermal
energy.

7. Conclusions

Given their broad flexibility to burn highly heterogeneous fuels,
grate burners are mainly used for biomass combustion. Despite fixed-
bed combustion being an old technique used for thermal energy gen-
eration, there are challenges associated with direct biomass combus-
tion. To address these challenges, over the past few decades, scien-
tific efforts have yielded many experimental investigations concerning

biomass fixed-bed combustion-related phenomena. The present work
consolidated, summarized, and discussed the literature associated with
packed-bed  combustion  in  laboratory-scale  set-ups.  In  addition,  the
main parameters used as indicators of bed combustion performance
were  defined,  and  the  main  operational  factors  that  influence  the
reaction performance were described.

Countercurrent fixed-bed combustion occurs in the reaction zone.
Inside this narrow region bounded by the ignition front and bed level,
all thermochemical transformations of the fuel particles proceed. Dur-
ing fixed-bed combustion, the chemical reaction performance manifests
through the variation in the reaction zone thickness. The combina-
tion of the reaction zone stoichiometry, packing degree, fuel particle
morphology, and physicochemical properties dominates the reaction
zone  thickness.  The  main  effects  of  these  fixed-bed  parameters  are
summarized as follows:

- The reaction zone stoichiometry depends on the difference be-
tween  the  reaction  rate  and  the  oxidant  medium  supply  rate.
The latter includes the oxidant’s thermodynamic state and flow
dynamics across the bed. In the absence of a secondary oxidant
feed, such a difference establishes three characteristic regimes
under which fixed-bed combustion occurs: (i) the oxygen-limited
regime, (ii) the reaction-limited regime, and (iii) the extinction
regime. However, staged air combustion significantly improves
the performance of the reaction zone, including increasing the
ignition and burning rates and reducing NOx emissions. These
improvements arise from an appropriate combination of primary
and secondary air supplies. In addition, the input of primary pre-
heated air increases the ignition and burning rates by decreasing
the sensible enthalpy required to heat fresh particles below the
ignition front to the ignition temperature.

- Fuel particle morphology and physicochemical properties control
the inwards heat transfer and, consequently, the evolution of the
sequential particle combustion stages. The bed’s packing level is
measured by its porosity, which affects the emitted heat distribu-
tion and the extent of the oxidant flow dissipative effect. Hence,
these properties govern the stability of the reaction zone.

- The  initial  fuel  moisture  content  influences  the  reaction  zone
behaviour. This parameter impacts combustion heat harnessing.
Experimental data from the literature suggest that, although an
increase  in  the  fuel  moisture  level  narrows  the  reaction  zone
thickness  and  reduces  the  ignition  rate  and  burning  rate,  the
combustion of the bed becomes more stable. Additionally, the
amount of unreacted fuel gas expelled from the bed is reduced.

One of the main limitations identified in this review is related to the
variation in the bed level position during reaction zone propagation.
The difficulty in measuring this parameter without interfering with
heat transfer inside the reaction zone is the main reason for the small
number of studies available in the literature. Nevertheless, knowing the
instant bed height would lead to the estimation of other parameters to
characterize the fixed-bed combustion performance, such as the bulk
density variation, char consumption rate, and reaction zone thickness.
Biomass  and  agricultural  residues  are  promising  alternatives  to
fossil fuels in regions and countries with high availability and good
geographic and annual distributions. Moreover, employing agricultural
residues as thermal energy sources leads to benefits that are consistent
with current sustainable commitments worldwide. Despite these advan-
tages, the direct combustion of these biomasses in grate furnaces has
drawbacks related to the vast diversity in the physicochemical proper-
ties of agricultural residues, which affects their combustion efficiency
and stability. However, the co-combustion of fuels with different char-
acteristics might improve the performance of the fixed bed. Different
characteristics may refer to mixtures with different values of properties
such as particle size, packing properties or volatile or fixed carbon
content. Nevertheless, it is necessary to carry out additional studies to
address this possibility, which would allow the establishment of criteria
for the suitable integration of agricultural residues as energy sources.
