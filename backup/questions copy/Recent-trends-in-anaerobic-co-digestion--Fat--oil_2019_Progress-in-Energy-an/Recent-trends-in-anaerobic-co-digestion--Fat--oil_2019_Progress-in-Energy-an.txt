Anaerobic digestion (AD) of wastewater sludge is an effective approach to produce biomethane and sub-
sequently reduce the amount of sludge disposal to landfill generated from wastewater treatment plants
(WWTPs). Recently, anaerobic co-digestion (ACD) of lipidic-waste such as fat, oil, and grease (FOG) has
received much attention for the enhancement of biomethanation in WWTPs. However, there are several
major challenges associated with ACD of FOG which includes inhibition by long chain fatty acids, sludge
floatation and washout, and scum formation. This review summarizes the scientific and engineering as-
pects of the FOG supplementation as a co-substrate in AD as well provides appropriate solutions for
challenges encountered during the anaerobic operation. The discussion on the existing pretreatment ap-
proaches (including mechanical, thermo-chemical, and biological) for rapid degradation of FOG was also
highlighted. Metagenomic analysis elucidates the microbial community and the interspecies interactions
which are responsible for the degradation of FOG and its biomethanation during ACD. Addition of FOG to
AD was found be economically feasible in municipal WWTPs.

tion of WWTPs. However, only 40–50% of the organic portion of
sludge is converted to biomethane, resulting in low digestion ef-
ficiency and biomethane yield [1,2] . Typical digesters can recover
20–40% of the energy requirement for WWTPs that use the acti-
vated sludge process [3,4] . Anaerobic co-digestion (ACD) of differ-
ent organic wastes with wastewater sludge offers a cost effective
option for the improvement of digestion efficiency and subsequent
biomethane yield [5] . The financial benefits of the ACD facilities
strongly dependent on the substrate characteristics, cost of diges-
tion, biomethane yield, and cost of waste disposal after digestion.
Fat, oil, and grease (FOG) is present in wastewater generated
from  edible  oil  producers,  food  processing  industries,  slaughter-
houses, and food wastes. Elimination of FOG from waste streams
is essential due to its negative effects in sewer systems, pipes, and
interceptors in WWTPs. Collected FOG is usually landfilled; how-
ever, recent management strategies such as ACD have gained more
attention because it improves the energy yield and decreases the
environmental impacts of landfills [6] . FOG is considered to be a
desirable substrate to enhance biomethane production through co-
digestion  as  it  has  been  reported  to  increase  the  methane  yield
by 250–350% [7,8] . The lipidic nature of FOG causes higher biogas
production due to its higher convertibility (94.8%) to biogas com-
pared  to  carbohydrate  (50.4%)-  and  protein  (71%)-rich  substrates
[9] . Hydrolysis of FOG produces glycerol and long-chain fatty acids

(LCFAs), which typically have 14 to 24 carbon atoms. Under anaer-
obic conditions, LCFAs are degraded via β-oxidation to short-chain
2 , and biomethane [10] . The inhibi-
fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, H
tion of methanogens due to LCFAs is a major operational problem
in anaerobic systems, especially in the cases where the digesters
are fed with wastes having high lipid contents. Accumulation of
LCFAs changes the cellular morphology, decreases cell permeability
and affects the mass transport [11] . Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes
are considered to be crucial for the performance of anaerobic hy-
drolysis  and  acidification  of  FOG  [12–14] .  Methanogenic  species,
especially Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina were reported to en-
hance biomethane production [15] . Developing strategies to enrich
the required microbial flora and increase the stability of anaero-
bic digesters at high FOG loading rates is key for enhancement of
biomethane production.

There  are  a  few  review  articles  focused  on  the  ACD  of  FOG
[16,17] . These reviews mainly focused on FOG generation and man-
agement.  However,  the  degradation  kinetics  for  saturated  fatty
acids (SFAs) and unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs) in FOG are not de-
scribed in previous reviews. The microbial communities and their
involvement in FOG degradation are not well understood. Thus, the
motivation of present review is to, (1) discuss the scientific and en-
gineering aspects of the FOG supplementation as a co-substrate in
AD, (2) provide appropriate solutions for challenges encountered
during  the  operation  process,  (3)  report  the  optimum  operation
conditions  for  co-digestion  of  FOG,  (4)  discuss  the  existing  pre-
treatment approaches in the ACD process, (5) propose a potential
biological pretreatment method for FOG degradation, (6) highlight
the degradation kinetics of SFAs and USFAs in FOG during ACD, (7)
discuss the use of metagenomic analysis to understand the micro-
bial community and their interspecies interactions in ACD, and (8)
estimate the economic feasibility of FOG utilization in municipal
WWTPs.

1.1. Characteristics of FOG

FOG is a preferred co-substrate for ACD because of its higher
4  kg −1 ) ( Fig. 1 ) compared
theoretical biomethane yield (1 m 3  CH
to  carbohydrate  (0.42  m 3  CH
4  kg −1 )  and  protein  (0.63  m 3  CH
4
kg −1 ) [18,19] . The physico-chemical characteristics of FOG can vary
greatly  depending  on  the  types  of  fat,  oil,  and  grease  and  their
sources of collection ( Table 1 ). Despite the variations, FOG carries
acidic pH ( ∼4–5) and high volatile solids (VS) to total solids (TS)
ratio (VS/TS ≥ 90%). The VS in FOG contains significant amount of
saturated (palmitic acid and stearic acid), monounsaturated (oleic
acid), and polyunsaturated (linoleic acid) fatty acids [20] . High con-
tent of VS is one of the cause for the increased total chemical oxy-
gen  demand  (tCOD)  of  FOG.  The  presence  of  volatile  fatty  acids
(VFAs) is a beneficial factor of FOG, since such SCFAs are readily
biodegradable to generate biomethane [21] .

Several  studies  have  reported  significant  improvement  in
biomethane production (109–197%) with FOG co-digestion [7,22] .
Since lipids show less biodegradability as a single substrate, inter-
est in the utilization of FOG as a co-substrate in ACD has been in-
creased over the past few years. Co-digestion with FOG has proved
to be especially useful in increasing biogas yield and its economic
feasibility in WWTPs [23–26] . FOG characteristics provides better
understanding of the quality and quantity of organic wastes that
can be added safely as a co-substrate to ACD. These characteristics
suggest that FOG is a potential organic feedstock to boost biogas
production.

1.2. Process mechanism of anaerobic co-digestion

Anaerobic digestion is a complex biological process that con-
verts  organic  substrates  (including  carbohydrates,  proteins,  and

lipids)  into  biomethane  through  various  microbial  pathways  and
biochemical  reactions  ( Table  2 ).  Anaerobic  microbiology  showed
that  the  production  of  biomethane  through  co-digestion  of  FOG
is  achieved  by  the  concerted  action  of  three  groups  of  mi-
croorganisms,  (1)  hydrolytic  (2)  syntrophic  acidogenic,  and  (3)
methanogenic ( Fig. 2 ). Anaerobic digestion results in the hydrolysis
of FOG into LCFAs and glycerol. The LCFAs are converted into ac-
etate and hydrogen via the β- oxidation pathway. Acetate is further
degraded into CH
2 in subsequent reactions. The glycerol
is sequentially degraded to 1,3 propandiol, acetate, and hydrogen
( Table 2 ).

4 and CO

The  anaerobic  system  must  contain  different  microbial  com-
munities responsible for hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and
methanogenesis  in  order  to  effectively  produce  biogas.  The  bac-
terial metabolic process occurs via several intermediate steps in-
volving  different  clusters  of  anaerobic  microorganisms  such  as
hydrolytic and fermentative (acidogenic and acetogenic) bacteria,
methanogens (acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic), sulfate-reducing
bacteria,  and ammonifying bacteria.  The  first  phase of  anaerobic
digestion is hydrolysis, where fermentative bacteria release extra-
cellular enzymes known as hydrolase (i.e., cellulase, amylases, pro-
teases,  lipases)  to  hydrolyze  insoluble  organic  compounds  such
as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into monosaccharides, amino
acids, LCFAs, and glycerol ( Fig. 2 ). Hydrolytic and fermentative bac-
teria belong to bacterial phyla such as Proteobacteria, Firmicutes,
and Bacteroidetes. The rate of hydrolysis depends on several key
parameters  including  pH,  particle  size,  and  diffusion  barrier  be-
tween enzyme and substrate. The hydrolyzed products are subse-
quently converted to organic acids (acetate, propionate, butyrate,
pyruvate, succinate, lactate, and malate), alcohols (methanol and
ethanol), CO
2 by acidifying bacteria. The acidogenesis oc-
curs via hydrogenation and dehydrogenation depending on the mi-
crobial population.

2 , and H

The bacteria responsible for acidogenesis mainly belong to En-
2  and
terobacteriaceae,  Clostridia,  Bacillus ,  and  Bacteroides .  The  CO
H
2  produced  from  the  acidogenic  phase  are  converted  to  ac-
etate  by  acetogenic  bacteria  in  the  acetogenic  phase.  The  H
2
produced  during  this  phase  can  be  detrimental  to  heterotrophic
methanogens.  To  avoid  this,  a  symbiotic  relationship  must  ex-
ist between the acetogenic bacteria and autotrophic methanogens
[27,28] . The final step of the anaerobic digestion is methanogen-
esis,  where  the  methanogens  utilize  the  products  generated  in
2 )  to  produce  CH
the  previous  phases  (acetic  acid,  CO
4
( Fig. 2 ). During the last phase, ∼ 70% CH
4  is generated via ace-
toclastic  methanogenesis  where  acetate  is  metabolized  by  het-
4  as primary product and
erotrophic methanogens to produce CH
2  as  byproduct,  as  ∼ 90%  of  the  methanogenic  population  is
CO
dominated by acetoclastic methanogens [29] . The remaining quan-
tity of methane ( ∼ 30%) is generated through anabolic process of
autotrophic (hydrogenotrophic) methanogens using CO
2 as
substrate [27] .

The  physicochemical  characteristics  of  sludge  presented  in
Table 3 show that the pH of sludge ranges between 5.4–7.5. The
optimal pH for anaerobic digestion falls in the range of 7.2 to 8.0
[30] , and pH buffering might be required to assure favorable con-
ditions for the process, especially during co-digestion with acidic
substrates such as FOG. Sludge usually have a lower tCOD com-
pared to FOG. In addition, the contents of ammonia, protein and
carbon-nitrogen (C/N) ratio are influential aspects of sludge. High
amounts of nitrogen in sludge can lead to the formation of am-
monia,  which  inhibits  the  anaerobic  process  [31–33] ,  and  opti-
mum range of the C/N ratio for AD has been reported to be 20–30
[34] . Sludge derived from municipal WWTPs usually contains very
low  C/N  ratio  ( Table  3 ),  thus,  supplementation  of  co-substrates
having high C/N ratio could help to reach the desired conditions
for AD.

2. The current challenges of biomethane production in
anaerobic co-digestion of FOG

Anaerobic co-digestion has been applied for both the produc-
tion of CH
4 from organic wastes and their volume reduction in lab-
oratory, pilot scale, and field scale studies [35–38] . Several factors
inhibit the production of CH
4 during the anaerobic digestion pro-
cess. One of the most influential factors is LCFAs, which are pro-
duced during the anaerobic hydrolysis of lipids [39] . Other poten-
tial inhibitors of methanogens include H
3 , heavy metals, and
toxic hydrocarbon compounds [40] . The major outcomes of LCFAs
presence are sludge floatation, scum formation, digester foaming,
and sludge washout which ultimately affect the biomethane pro-
duction by decreasing substrate accessibility and utilization [39] .
These  problems  lead  to  significant  reduction  in  the  production
rate of CH
4  and digester performance. The following subsections
discuss  the  different  substances  that  are  found  to  inhibit  the
methanogens.

2.1. Substrate and product transport limitations due to LCFAs

LCFAs causes barrier to substrate diffusion as well as transport
and accession throughout the digester due to mass transfer limi-
tations [41,42] . The adsorption rate of LCFAs increases with higher
LCFA concentration [43] . Moreover, the adsorption rate is faster in
case of mixture compared to single LCFA such as oleate. The pro-
longed  lag  phase  observed  in  the  presence  of  LCFAs  was  prob-
ably  caused  by  substrate  and  product  transport  limitations  [44] .
Reduced transport limitations could be achieved by lowering the
solid retention time (SRT), which decreased the concentration of
adsorbed  and  free  LCFAs  inside  the  digester  [45] .  The  substrate
and product transport limitations can vary depending on digester
configuration. A stronger mixing condition in the CSTR is reported
to support higher lipid degradation (63–68%) compared to that in
UASB reactor (48–67%) [46,47] . Although the CSTR could support
higher lipid degradation, the low retention time of the LCFAs and
biomass creates another potential challenge [47] .

2.2. Sludge floatation and washout due to LCFAs

Sludge  flotation  and  washout  due  to  accumulation  of  fatty
acids on the surface of biomass has been reported in the litera-
ture [18,4 8,4 9] . Sludge floatation leading to biomass washout con-
tributed more to the failure of FOG co-digestion than the toxicity
of LCFAs [44, 50] . The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of a UASB-
based treatment is maintained at high values to ensure a longer
SRT for the growth of microbes inside a sludge blanket. To avoid
washout, the sludge bed is designed to have good settling proper-
ties [51] . Sludge floatation leads to sludge washout from the UASB
as the design of solid retention time was based on the efficient
settling of the sludge blanket  [52] . Failure of milk fat treatment
by  UASB  was  reported  due  to  sludge  floatation  [53] .  The  severe
washout of UASB occurred due to floatation during the treatment
of LCFAs containing wastewater [49,54] . A novel inverted anaerobic
sludge blanket reactor (IASB) has been developed to utilize float-
ing sludge in the maintenance of sludge beds for the treatment of
LCFA-containing wastewater [55] .

Scum formation in the AD can be prevented by considering the
operational conditions such as (1) organic loading rate, (2) proper
mixing,  (3)  thermophilic  digestion,  (4)  hydraulic  retention  time,
and (5) suspension pH. Another approach to avoid scum formation
is  efficient  pretreatment  of  substrate.  A  combined  pretreatment
method has been reported to reduce the scum layer in the AD such
as addition of calcium peroxide with microwave irradiation which
can reduce scum layer formation and increase biogas production
by 25.4%. Ultrasonication and hydrodynamic cavitation have been

used to remove the scum layer and enhance biomethane produc-
tion ( Fig. 3 ). More recently, the application of an efficient bacterial
consortium showed encouraging results due to enhanced degrada-
tion of LCFAs [8] . Sludge washout can be avoided by using a CSTR
that has the same HRT and SRT [56,57] . No sludge washout was
observed for a CSTR during the anaerobic co-digestion of grease
trap wastes (GTW) with municipal sludge. The only observed op-
erational challenges were digester foaming and scum layer forma-
tion [ 10 , 18 , 58 ]. Sludge floatation leading to biomass washout has
resulted in the failure of FOG ACD. The washout can be recovered
by designing a digester in such a way that it retains the floating
sludge containing biomass for a longer period of time through re-
cycling of scum layer.

2.3. Other inhibitors

Sulfide is generated during the AD due to the activity of sulfate-
reducing  bacteria  (SRB).  The  SRB  use  organic  substrates  as  the
source of electron donors and reduce the sulfate to sulfide, which
is highly toxic to the methanogens [59] . Undissociated H
2 S is more
toxic  than  dissolved  sulfide.  The  H
2 S  directly  diffuses  into  the
cell membrane, denatures proteins and co-enzymes by the forma-
tion of sulfide cross-linking, and interferes with assimilatory sulfur
metabolism [40] . The toxicity of sulfide increases with an increase
in pH [60] . The toxicity level of sulfide ranges between 10 0–80 0 mg
L −1 for dissolved sulfide and 50–400 mg L −1 for undissociated H
2 S.

[61] .

Ammonia  (NH

3 )  is  formed  during  anaerobic  degradation  of
nitrogen-rich compounds such as proteins and urea. NH
3  is toxic
to methanogens as it diffuses passively into the cells, alters intra-
cellular pH, increases cellular maintenance energy, causes potas-
sium deficiency, and inhibits enzymatic activity [40] . Among the
two forms of ammonia in aqueous solution, free NH

reduction in methanogenic activity was reported in granular sludge

tic methanogens were 520 and 280 mg L −1 , respectively [65] . Sim-
ilar inhibition of the propionate degrading acetogenic bacteria has

3 inhibits the anaerobic bacteria at high concentration.
Some of the major heavy metals which influence anaerobic di-
gestion are Cd, Zn, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Co [67,68] . The toxic effect of
heavy metals lies in their enzyme disruption activity, which op-
erates either by binding to the thiol and other groups on a pro-
tein  molecule  or  by  replacing  naturally  occurring  metals  in  en-
zyme  prosthetic  groups.  The  level  of  heavy  metal  inhibition  de-
pends  on  its  concentration,  chemical  form,  redox  potential,  and
pH [40] . The complete inhibition of methanogen Methanospirilum
hungatei  GP1  was  reported  to  be  95%  for  50  μM  of  Cu,  Zn,  and
Hg [69] . In addition, Cr inhibited methanogens at a concentration
higher than 2500 mg L −1 [70] . Similar inhibition was reported for
Ni at a concentration of 1600 mg L −1 [70] . Heavy metals act as mi-
cronutrients and improve CH
4 production at lower concentrations.
Improvement of anaerobic digestion is reported at optimum Ni and
Co concentrations of 0.13 and 3.5 mg L −1 , respectively [71] .

pends  on  the  specific  inhibitor.  The  inhibition  is  influenced  by
several  factors  such  as  exposure  time,  biomass  loading,  concen-
tration  of  inhibitor,  temperature,  cell  age  of  the  methanogens,
and acclimatization ability of the methanogens [40] . It has been
reported  that  chlorophenols  in  sludge  could  inhibit  syntrophic
methanogens, and reduce the biomethane production in WWTPs
50  of  50 mg  L −1  for
[76] ;  whereas,  chloroform  showed  an  IC
methanogens [77] . Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) inhibits aceto-
clastic methanogens in the range of 0.5–3 mg L −1 . Acidogens are
less sensitive to PCBs compared to methanogens [78] .

3. Improvement of the performance of an anaerobic digester
during FOG co-digestion through pretreatment

The rate limiting step in AD of sludge is hydrolysis because of
the complex floc structure (e.g., extracellular polymeric substances
(EPS)) and tough cell wall. The slow rate of hydrolysis causes high
HRT,  low  organic  solids  degradation,  and  poor  biomethane  pro-
duction  [ 38 , 79 ].  Such  bottlenecks  indicate  the  ever-growing  im-
portance of pretreatment of substrates in AD. Several sludge and
co-substrate pretreatment options (including mechanical, chemical,
and biological processes or integrations of these) have been devel-
oped to speed up the hydrolysis step for subsequent improvement
of  biomethane  generation  with  various  levels  of  success  at  both
laboratory and pilot scale [80–83] . Under optimized conditions, the
pretreatment methods can expedite the disintegration and conver-
sion  of  particulate  organic  matter  to  simpler  substrates  such  as
sugar,  amino  acids,  and  SCFAs,  making  them  more  accessible  to
subsequent microbial activities. The pretreatment of sludge offers
numerous advantages including improvement in lysis of microbial
cells and bio-accessibility, enhancement of organic solids degrada-
tion, biomethane production, and cost effectiveness during diges-
tate dewatering. In light of its beneficial role in sludge disintegra-
tion, pretreatment has become an indispensable step prior to ACD.
Some of the conventional and recently emerging pretreatment ap-
proaches are identified herein ( Fig. 4 and Table 4 ). These are com-
monly used to treat various substrates including waste activated
sludge (WAS), kitchen waste, grease trap sludge, and FOG.

3.1. Mechanical pretreatment of sludge and FOG

3.1.1. High-pressure homogenization

High-pressure homogenization (HPH) is a mechanical pretreat-
ment technique that was initially developed for the stabilization
of food and dairy emulsions, and it is very popular in large-scale
operations [84] . HPH involves externally applied pressure on solid
particles and microbial cells in the sludge. The system includes a
homogenizer that has a positive displacement air pump to pres-
surize the sludge particles through a narrow orifice. The homoge-
nizing pressure is regulated by adjusting the homogenizing valve,
which provides an abrupt pressure drop leading to high fluid shear
within the sludge. The sludge particles break off when the exter-
nal pressure surpasses the internal resistance of the flocs and/or
microbial cells, which causes rupture of the cell membrane, releas-
ing the intra-cellular material into the aqueous phase [85] .

HPH has been widely used for pretreatment of algal biomass
and sludge. There are limited reports that also mentioned the ap-
plication of HPH for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass or
fatty substrates. Although there are few reports on the use of HPH
for  direct  pretreatment  of  FOG,  it  has  been  widely  used  for  the
treatment and emulsification of lipidic-wastes such as dairy prod-
ucts.  The  effect  of  HPH  on  raw  whole  bovine  milk  globule  size
(among  other  properties)  has  been  investigated  [86] .  HPH  treat-
ment of fat globules in milk (50–200 MPa) showed effective disin-
tegration of globules into smaller size flocs compared to the con-
ventionally homogenized samples. They observed that a significant
fat  globule  size  reduction  of  raw  milk  can  be  achieved  through
HP homogenization at 200–250 MPa at an inlet temperature of 4–
24 °C. Thiebaud et al. [87] also investigated the influence of HPH
on dairy milk and suggested that HPH decreased the particle size
of fat globules in dairy milk. However, a subsequent investigation
suggested that low fat globule size was more dependent on the
presence of fat in a liquid state when exiting the primary homog-
enization valve than the actual homogenization pressure. These in-
vestigations are at preliminary level and are being used to monitor
the effect of HPH on substrate properties. The impact of HPH on
the actual AD process has not been studied yet. The HPH pretreat-

ment of dairy and slaughterhouse wastewater could be effective for
fragmentation of complex lipid molecules.

3.1.2. Ultrasonication

Ultrasonication is one of the most efficient physical treatments
for disintegration of substrates in AD process. This is a sophisti-
cated  process  in  which  ultrasound  waves  propagate  through  the
medium, creating regions of compression and rarefaction. Subse-
quently, it leads to the formation of microbubbles, which gradually
grow in successive cycles and reach an unstable diameter at which
they violently implode in a process known as cavitation. Cavitation
generates excessive local heating and high pressure at a liquid-gas
interface along with turbulent conditions. This turbulence and the
other effects of cavitation result in intensive mixing of insoluble
liquids  (e.g.,  water  and  oil)  to  form  stable  emulsions.  Cavitation
also generates highly reactive species such as •H and •OH radicals,
which contribute to chemical degradation of organic compounds
( Fig. 4 ).

Considering its wide applicability in the pretreatment of crop
residues, wheat, and sludge, ultrasonication has been investigated
for possible use as a pretreatment for FOG. There are mixed re-
ports  regarding  the  success  of  ultrasonication  for  the  pretreat-
ment  of  FOG.  Moisan  [88]  studied  the  effects  of  ultrasonication
on FOG and observed that sonicated substrates released more or-
ganic  carbon  into  solution  than  unsonicated  substrates.  The  au-
thor  concluded  that  the  increase  in  organic  load  was  probably
due to the dissolution of LCFAs in the aqueous phase, which sub-
sequently  enhanced  biomethane  production.  In  contrast  to  these
encouraging  results,  Li  et  al.  [89]  reported  a  negative  influence
of ultrasonication. They studied the impact of ultrasonication on
two  types  of  substrates,  FOG  and  kitchen  waste.  Although  co-
digestion with FOG produced higher volumes of biomethane, ul-
trasonic pretreatment of FOG prior to co-digestion did not improve

the ultimate biomethane yield. However, ultrasonic pretreatment
of kitchen waste promoted biomethane yield during co-digestion.
Furthermore, the lag phases of the FOG co-digesters treated with
ultrasonication were much longer and were accompanied by de-
layed exponential phases, although all FOG co-digestions exhibited
similar ultimate biomethane yields.

In a different approach, palm oil mill effluent containing high
lipid  content  was  treated  with  ultrasonication  [90] .  A  maximum
SCOD/TCOD ratio of 29% was achieved after 30 min of ultrasonic
treatment  at  20 kHz  and  100 W,  suggesting  increased  biodegrad-
ability  of  the  soluble  organic  material  during  the  treatment.  Al-
though  the  results  of  ultrasonication  treatment  did  not  provide
a  consistent  conclusion,  the  combination  of  ultrasonication  with
other treatments has been proved to be effective. When ultrasound
was applied to dairy wastewater treatment for the removal of fat
using an enzyme as a catalyst, a maximum hydrolysis of 78% was
achieved at 165 W ultrasonication power and 25 kHz, 66% duty cy-
cle, and 0.2% enzyme loading (w v −1 ). Ultrasonic irradiation cou-
pled  with  enzyme  catalyzed  pretreatment  resulted  in  significant
process  intensification  due  to  mass  transfer  by  cavitation.  These
authors  suggested  that  ultrasonic  irradiation  can  be  used  to  en-
hance mass transfer, improve the rate of hydrolysis, and decrease
the  reaction  time.  Ultrasonic  pretreatment  (using  0.20 W  mL −1 )
for 10 and 30 min followed by 3 and 7 min of microwave irradi-
ation (2450 MHz and 700 W), respectively, also showed an increase
in the ratios of SCOD/TCOD and BOD
5 /SCOD, indicating that com-
bined pretreatment enhanced the release of organic materials from
a solid to a liquid phase as a result of increased degradability.

3.1.3. Microwave irradiation

Microwave  (MW)  irradiation  is  a  popular  pretreatment  tech-
nology. MW heating has attracted great attention in recent years
and provides several advantages, including rapid and efficient heat-

ing in a controlled environment, increasing processing rates, and
a significant reduction in reaction time (up to 80%) [91] . MW ir-
radiation  usually  operates  at  a  wavelength  of  1  mm  to  1  m  in
the electromagnetic spectrum, with corresponding oscillation fre-
quencies of 0.3– to 300 GHz [92,93] . A shorter frequency range of
900–2450 MHz is useful for the disintegration of sludge flocs [38] .
MW  irradiation  generates  continuous  and  repetitive  rapid  align-
ment  and  realignment  of  dipoles  in  a  polar  solvent,  which  sub-
sequently cause thermal effects under oscillating electromagnetic
fields. These effects result in an increase in the temperature of the
intracellular liquor of flocs to their boiling points, leading to their
breakdown [38] . Several investigations have suggested the use of
MW irradiation to enhance the pretreatment of sewage sludge for
AD [94,95] ; however, it has not been fully studied for FOG waste.
The hydrolysis of palm oil was explored under conventional heat-
ing and microwave irradiation using CaO as a catalyst [96] . Opti-
mized conditions such as a microwave power of 150 W, an alco-
hol to oil molar ratio of 9:1, 5% catalyst, and 60 min reaction time
were found to increase the rate of hydrolysis and overall reaction
rate. Saifuddin and Fazlili [90] applied microwave pretreatment on
palm oil mill effluent with a high FOG content (40 0 0 mg L −1 ). The
samples were irradiated at a 2450 MHz (700 W) MW frequency for
a short duration (3 and 7 min). A 3 min treatment increased the
temperature from 10 to 59 °C, which led to an increase in SCOD
and BOD
5 /SCOD ratio from 11 to 21% and 0.44 to 0.56, respectively.
The pretreated substrate ultimately enhanced the biomethane pro-
duction by 57% in the anaerobic digestion process.

3.1.4. Thermal pretreatment

Thermal hydrolysis of biomass is one of the most studied pre-
treatment methods, and it has already been commercialized at full
scale [92,97] . The generalized concept of thermal hydrolysis is to
expose substrates to high temperatures (typically 150–220 °C) and
pressures (60 0–250 0 kPa) at a specified time to promote the sol-
ubilization  of  larger  biomolecules.  The  efficiency  of  thermal  hy-
drolysis is dependent upon the treatment temperature and hold-
ing  time.  This  technology  has  been  widely  utilized  for  the  pre-
treatment of various types of substrates including sludge, manure,
abattoir waste, lignocellulosic wastes, and algal biomass. The great
success of thermal pretreatment at commercial scale has led sev-
eral researchers to investigate its possible application in the pre-
treatment of FOG-rich waste substrates. The influence of thermal
pretreatment on the degradation of FOG present in kitchen waste
was investigated [97] . They observed that thermal pretreatment at
140 °C for 50 min significantly increased the FOG degradation po-
tential by 36%, while the lag phase for degradation of pretreated
FOG was also reduced by 82% compared with untreated kitchen
waste.  Such  rapid  degradation  of  organic  fractions  into  smaller
molecules ultimately improved the biogas yield. In another study,
the optimum temperature for increased VFA production was be-
tween 150 °C and 170 °C [98] . Moreover, it was found that polyun-
saturated  fatty  acids  were  more  amenable  to  thermal  hydrolysis
than monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Another study also
reported  a  30%  enhancement  in  biogas  production  after  thermal
pretreatment [99] . Fats such as glyceride fatty acids decomposed

30

into volatile acids such as acetic and propionic acids. The acceler-
ated degradation of complex LCFAs into simple volatile fatty acids
helped anaerobes to produce biomethane.

3.2. Chemical pretreatment of sludge and FOG

3.2.1. Acid and alkali pretreatment

Chemical pretreatments, including acid and alkali, are promis-
ing  methods  for  substrate  solubilization.  These  treatment  ap-
proaches offer several advantages such as ease of operation, high
biomethane conversion efficiency, and most importantly low-cost
[38] . The reactors can be operated at ambient or moderate tem-
peratures, since the addition of chemicals avoids the need of high
temperature. Acid hydrolysis is carried out using acids such as HCl,
3 . In alkali pretreatments, several options
H
such as NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)

The use of alkali for treatment of FOG has been widely studied.
The alkali treatment leads to ‘saponification,’ which disintegrates
the lipid into LCFAs salts (soaps) and glycerol. The conversion of
lipids and free LCFAs constituting insoluble FOG wastes into sol-
uble soaps enhances the contact between the substrate and mi-
croorganisms, resulting in improved anaerobic biodegradability and
reduced  inhibition  by  LCFAs  [100] .  The  effect  of  NaOH  pretreat-
ments to hydrolyze fat globules in slaughterhouse wastewater has
been studied [101] . The pretreatment using NaOH below 400 meq
L −1  for 4 h did not increase SCOD in slaughterhouse wastewater;
however, NaOH concentrations ranging from 150 to 300 meq L −1
showed a reduction in the average particle size to 73% of the ini-
tial average particle size. Even though the fat globules are smaller,
they float on the surface of the sludge in a digester due to their hy-
drophobic properties and are unavailable for immediate consump-
tion for the microbes. A reduction in the size of fat globules would
increase the surface area and is helpful to accelerate the digestion.
Addition of bentonite/calcium to FOG could be an attractive way
of  preventing  LCFAs  from  upsetting  an  anaerobic  digester  [102] .
The most preferable approach for the addition of bentonite/calcium
to the anaerobic digestion system was mixing the FOG with ben-
tonite/calcium before the addition to AD ( Fig. 5 ). Studies on mi-
crobial  community  analysis  after  addition  of  chemical  treatment
is rare. Microbial community analysis showed that bacteria within
phylum  Firmicutes  increased  from  2%  (control)  to  43.2%  due  to
2  addition, which played an important role in the hydrolysis
CaO
and acidification of substrate [103] .

3.2.2. Thermo-chemical pretreatment

Thermo-chemical  pretreatment  is  probably  the  most  effective
and investigated method for FOG. Earlier studies have verified that
individual thermal and chemical treatments provided satisfying re-
sults.  Several  researchers  have  combined  thermal  and  chemical
pretreatments to enhance the overall pretreatment efficiency. Ther-
mochemical pretreatment (60 °C for 30 min, and 0.04 mol of NaOH
g −1  COD) of slaughterhouse waste and animal carcasses contain-
ing a high amount of FOG showed improved initial reaction kinet-
ics and increased biogas yield to 1200 mL g −1 VS, indicating bet-
ter initial bio-availability compared to untreated wastes [104] . In
a subsequent study by the same group, the pretreatment was op-
timized (50% w −1  NaOH, 0.156 mol g −1  VS at 60, 120 and 150 °C
for 3 h) to further improve the biodegradation of organic matter in
fed-batch digesters [105] . The authors found that a temperature of
120 °C was most favorable for anaerobic digester performance in
terms of specific gas generation and equivalent degraded load.

The enhancement in biomethane recovery after pretreatment of
FOG  and kitchen waste  was evaluated  [89] . The  co-digestion re-
sults indicated that thermochemical pretreatments at pH 8–10 and
55 °C provided the best conditions to increase biomethane gener-
ation. The biogas production was increased by ∼10% through the
thermo-chemical  pretreatment  of  organic  substrates.  A  following
investigation reported that FOG co-digestion with thermochemical
pretreatment yielded higher biomethane production compared to
FOG  co-digestion  with  thermal  pretreatment  at  55 °C  alone.  The
pretreated FOG co-digestion at pH 10 and pH 12 (55 °C) achieved
the  highest  biomethane  productions  with  values  of  288 mL  g −1
T VS and 287 mL g −1 T VS, respectively [106] . This study confirmed
the  effectiveness  of  the  integrated  process.  In  a  different  study,
the  co-digestion  of  pretreated  WAS  and  fatty  wastewater  (80 °C
and pH 8, 0:14 g KOH g −1 VS) in a semi-continuous anaerobic di-
gester showed a significant increase in biomethane production by
58% [107] . A variable lipid hydrolysis efficiency of 89% for flesh fat
waste  and  52–54%  for  meat  processing  waste  was  reported  un-
der reaction conditions of 0.04 mol of NaOH g −1  COD, 70 °C, and
60 min [108] and 0.3 g of caustic soda g −1 TS at 55 °C for 24 h [109] ,
respectively. These authors used a novel reactor configuration to
improve  performance,  in  which  the  saponification  pretreatment
and  digested  solids  were  recirculated  to  the  anaerobic  digestion
of slaughterhouse waste. These two strategies acted synergistically
where,  the  thermochemical  pretreatment  promoted  the  bioavail-
ability and emulsification of solid fatty substrates, and solids re-
circulation provided substrate dilution and minimized the risk of
biomass washout. As a result, this integrated process promoted the
enrichment and adaptation of active microorganisms.

3.2.3. Enzymatic pretreatment

Lipase, a pancreatic enzyme that is well known to catalyze the
breakdown of fats to fatty acids and glycerol or other alcohols, is a
specific tool for the treatment of lipid-rich substrates in an anaer-
obic process. Cammarota and Freire [110] have reviewed the use of
hydrolytic enzymes for the treatment of wastewater with high oil
and grease contents and concluded that more research is required
to understand the biodegradation of recalcitrant FOG components
in wastewater containing high contents of fat. Nevertheless, in the
last decade, numerous research effort s have been devoted to un-
derstand, optimize, and apply enzymatic pretreatment to hydrolyze
FOG. The pre-hydrolysis of FOG-rich waste enhanced the efficiency
of AD of meat processing waste [111,112] and Babassu oil process-
ing waste [112] . Several studies have reported the high efficiency
of lipase for reducing the COD of dairy wastewater [113] and fish
processing plant wastewater [114] . A study conducted in a hybrid
UASB reactor indicated that lipase pretreatment increases the or-
ganic load of lipidic wastewater [115] . It was found that treatment
with  pancreatic  lipase  significantly  reduced  the  size  of  pork  fat
globules, increased the concentration of LCFAs in the liquid phase,
and  decreased  the  digestion  time  of  slaughterhouse  wastewater
[113,116] . These results are in agreement with the observations of
Massee et al. [117] , where pancreatic-lipase pretreatment reduced
the average size of fat globules in slaughterhouse wastewater to a
maximum of 60% of the initial average particle size. A 4 h pretreat-
ment with lipase also increased the free LCFAs concentration to a
maximum of 15.5 mg L −1 . They observed that lipase was more effi-
cient with beef fat than pork fat, possibly because beef fat contains
fewer polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, these authors did not
verify the impact of pretreatment on the efficiency of AD.

Meng et al. [117] employed the lipase obtained from Aspergillus
niger  to  promote  the  hydrolysis  of  FOG-rich  food  waste  to  en-
hance biomethane production. They studied two strategies; i) ad-
dition  of  lipase  for  pretreatment  of  the  substrate  and  ii)  ad-
dition  of  lipase  directly  to  the  anaerobic  digester.  Their  results
showed that substrates pretreated with lipase (strategy i) achieved

higher biomethane production and VS reductions. Specifically, this
method provided a biomethane yield of 500 mL g −1 VS at 0.5% li-
pase concentration, which was 5–27% higher than that of strategy
ii. Their follow up study showed that the biomethane production
rate was increased by 81–158%, 27–54%, and 37–41% compared to
the  untreated  substrates  for  animal  fat,  vegetable  oil,  and  float-
able grease, respectively, which were pretreated for 24 h in 10 0 0–
1500 μL at 40–50 °C. Moreover, the digestion time was reduced by
10–40 d [118] . The research findings suggest that pretreatment of
FOG with appropriate lipase can increase the hydrolysis rate and
enhance  the  biomethane  production  rate  by  increasing  the  sub-
strate accessibility.

3.3. Biological pretreatment

Co-digestion  of  FOG  with  municipal  wastewater  sludge  can
greatly improve biomethane recovery at wastewater treatment fa-
cilities [8] , where carbohydrates present in the wastewater sludge
are  generally  digested  for  biomethanation.  Degradation  of  LCFAs
takes place through the β-oxidation pathway, which has been re-
ported as the rate-limiting step of the whole AD, due to the higher
energy required for the spontaneity of LCFA degradation compared
to simple sugars [119] . LCFAs are transported across the cell mem-
brane via a transporter or acyl-activation mechanism forming fatty
acyl-CoA [120] . Fatty acid transporters include fatty acid translo-
case (FAT/CD36), tissue-specific fatty acid transport proteins (FATP),
and plasma membrane-bound fatty acid binding protein (FABPpm)
[120] .  Fatty  acyl-CoA  undergoes  several  enzymatic  processes  to
oxidize  LCFAs  syntrophically  into  acetate  [121]  through  the  β-
oxidation  process  where  fatty  acyl-CoA  is  degraded  into  acetyl-
CoA units via a series of enzyme reactions (including acyl-CoA de-
hydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydroge-
nase,  and  acyl-CoA  acetyltransferase)  [122] .  Cycles  of  continuous
feeding of lipid/LCFA-rich wastewaters followed by batch degrada-
tion of the accumulated substrate might be an appropriate way to

treat this type of waste. Enhanced LCFAs conversion to biomethane
was observed in a two-phase bioreactor composed of a continu-
ous stirred tank reactor for acidogenesis and an upflow anaerobic
sludge blanket reactor for methanogenesis; these techniques effec-
tively facilitated the rate limiting hydrolysis process before acido-
genesis.  Microbial  communities  present  in  an  anaerobic  digester
degraded LCFAs to MCFAs and SCFAs from oily wastewater ( Fig. 6 )
and artificial LCFAs within 15 days [123] .

Recent advances in molecular microbiology have brought new
insights on the specific microbial ecology and the enzymatic reac-
tions involved in the β-oxidation process. LCFA-degrading bacteria
are closely related to the Clostridiaceae, Syntrophomonadaceae, Syn-
trophaceae, Enterobacteriaceae , and Bacteroides families [124–126] .
Metagenomic analysis of the digester microbiome showed a shift
in microbial population in the presence of different FOG loadings
( Fig.  7 ).  Changes  in  the  methanogenic  community  were  also  at-
tributed  to  the  effect  of  initial  FOG  concentration.  The  genomes
of Syntrophomonas wolfei (saturated short/medium-chain fatty acid
degrader)  and  S.  zehnderi  (saturated  and  unsaturated  LCFA  de-
grader) are being sequenced, and comparative genomics of these
related  species  might  shed  more  light  on  fatty  acid-degrading
pathways  and  the  regulatory  mechanisms  that  govern  degrada-
tion  of  fatty  acids  [127] .  These  microorganisms  are  commonly
proton-reducing,  anaerobic,  oxidizing  bacteria  that  require  syn-
2 -utilizing methanogens and acetoclas-
trophic interactions with H
tic methanogens. Acidogenesis can be two-directional due to the
effects of various populations of microorganisms and is classified
into hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.

Relative fraction of bacterial community ( Syntrophomonas ) and
methanogenic archaea in the FOG co-digester were increased upto
14  and  20%  with  increasing  FOG  loading  from  0  to  52%  (VS-
basis),  while  it  remained  3  and  2.5%  in  the  control  digester,  re-
spectively [8] . The basic pathway of transformation passes through
2 ,  whereas  other  acidogenesis  products  play
acetate,  CO
an  insignificant  role  [128] .  As  a  result  of  these  transformations,

2 ,  and  H

32

methanogens directly use the new products as substrates and en-
ergy sources. In the acidogenesis process, acetate-oxidizing bacteria
(including those of the genera Clostridia, Syntrophomonas , and Syn-
trophobacter ) convert fatty acids into acetate and hydrogen, which
can be used by methanogens [129] . Syntrophic cooperation of the
LCFA-degrading bacteria with hydrogenotrophic microorganisms is
required  to  maintain  low  hydrogen  partial  pressure  ( P H
2 )  [130] .
Fourteen  types  of  fatty  acid-degrading  syntrophic  bacteria  have
been  obtained  in  pure  culture  or  in  co-culture  with  hydrogen-
consuming microorganisms [131] and all belong to the family Syn-
trophomonadaceae . In some exceptional cases, a few other species
that can use straight-chain LCFAs with more than 12 carbon atoms
have also been described. Among these microorganisms, only four
species ( S. sapovorans, S. curvata, S. zehnderi , and T. lipolytica ) have
the capability to utilize mono- and/or polyunsaturated LCFAs (with
more than 12 carbon atoms).

Degradation of unsaturated LCFAs requires complete chain sat-
uration  before  β-oxidation.  Unsaturated  LCFAs  such  as  linoleate
(C18:2) and oleate (C18:1) are metabolized through a hydrogena-
tion  step  yielding  stearate  (C18:0).  Two  sequential  steps,  hydro-
genation and β-oxidation are involved in degradation of unsatu-
rated LCFAs. Syntrophic LCFAs-degrading bacteria use unsaturated
LCFAs as a sole carbon and energy source, while fermentative bac-
teria hydrogenate unsaturated LCFAs. Biohydrogenation of unsatu-
rated LCFAs by rumen bacteria was studied in which, conversion of
C18-unsaturated LCFAs to stearate involves positional and geomet-
ric isomerization of the double bonds coupled with one or more
hydrogenations  [130,  132] .  Linoleate  (cis-9,  cis-12-C18:2)  is  me-
tabolized via conjugated linoleate (mainly cis-9, trans11-C18:2) to
vaccenate  (trans-11-C18:1).  Hydrogenation  of  oleate  (cis-9-C18:1)
to  stearate  involves  a  trans-isomerization  to  vaccenate  (trans11-
C18:1). Biohydrogenation of linoleate (C18:2) in the rumen is car-
ried out mainly by strains belonging to the Butyrivibrio genus.

Palmitate (saturated fatty acid) enriched consortium.
Oleate (unsaturated fatty acid) enriched consortium.

Microorganisms  able  to  perform  this  step  are  species  from
the genera Acetobacterium, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Enterococ-
cus, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Pedio-
coccus,  Propionibacterium,  Roseburia,  Selenomonas ,  and  Streptococ-
cus . Some studies suggest that ß-oxidation might occur before fatty
acid chain saturation. Oleate (C18:1) has been found as an inter-
mediary of linoleate (C18:2) degradation, but stearate (C18:0) was
never observed during linoleate (C18:2) or oleate (C18:1) degrada-
tion. Other saturated LCFAs, such as palmitate (C16:0) and myris-
tate  (C14:0),  were  rapidly  produced  during  the  degradation  of
linoleate (C18:2) and oleate (C18:1) [130,132] . The mass balance re-
covery of C16:0 (saturated fatty acid) and C18:1 (unsaturated fatty
acid) ranged between 70 and 92% ( Table 5 ).

Most of the existing studies reported the dynamics of micro-
bial  community  involved  in  the  degradation  of  oleate,  stearate,
and/or  palmitate  as  a  pure  substrate  in  a  continuous  bioreactor.
These LCFAs are the most abundant LCFAs encountered in lipidic-
wastes [132] . A few studies have been performed in reactors treat-
ing complex or “real” lipidic-wastes, such as those in agro-food in-
dustry wastewaters or slaughterhouse solid wastes [133] . Further-
more, despite the main role of Syntrophomonas and Clostridium in
the anaerobic degradation of LCFAs, only a few species have been
quantified  in  such  studies  [134] .  Hydrogenotrophic  methanogens
such as syntrophic archaeae of the genus Methanosarcina [134] play
an essential role in the overall LCFAs degradation process by main-
taining a low redox potential through metabolic H
2  consumption
[8] .

A properly designed pretreatment can enhance the biomethane
productivity  and  the  rate  of  AD.  Mechanical  methods  including
high-pressure  homogenization,  ultrasonication,  microwave  irradi-
ation,  and  thermal  pretreatment  have  successfully  disintegrated
FOG. The efficiency of a thermal treatment can be increased fur-
ther through integration with chemical treatment (either acidic or
alkali).  Regarding  chemical  pretreatment  methods,  saponification
is preferred for enhancing the solubilization and bioavailability of
fat rich waste. These processes require relatively shorter pretreat-
ment time without the capability to degrade LCFAs. In contrast to
mechanical  and  chemical  treatments,  biological  methods  provide
an  effective  solution  which  include  degradation  of  LCFAs  to  SC-

FAs with relatively prolonged treatment time compared to other
treatments. There are a few studies that investigated economic fea-
sibility of different pretreatments. However, the lack of ‘standard
cost-benefit optimization tool’ for evaluation of the technical feasi-
bility of each pretreatment method from the economic, energetic,
and environmental perspectives, which limits reliable comparisons
across the literature. Co-digestion is the most advantageous tech-
nology for the conversion of waste into valuable biogas. Neverthe-
less, much research efforts are needed, especially focusing on re-
actor design and process optimization for FOG co-digestion in or-
der to bring this technology at commercial platforms for high cost
benefits.

4. Feasibility of co-digestion of FOG and process optimization

Anaerobic  co-digestion  of  FOG  is  beneficial  for  greater
biomethane yields from sewage sludge due to its higher contents
of carbon and hydrogen. The lipidic nature of FOG increases its ca-
pacity to carry excessive volatile organics ( > 90%) [135] . This ex-
cessive amount of volatile matter could theoretically be converted
to biomethane at a rate of 1014 L kg −1 , which is 274% and 137%
higher than the yields from carbohydrate and protein, respectively
[136] . A rapid increase in biogas production (up to 80%) was ob-
served in full-scale wastewater sludge digesters upon addition of
FOG  at  a  volumetric  ratio  of  10–30%  [16,137] .  The  complete  uti-
lization  of  FOG  during  ACD  depends  on  the  chemical  nature  of
the  FOG.  Palmitic  acid  is  a  main  structural  LCFA  in  FOG  [138] ,
which is also an intermediate during the biodegradation of other
LCFAs. Cavaleiro et al. [139] reported that palmitic acid accumu-
lation in the anaerobic reactors was significantly reduced during
higher methanogenic activity, and vice versa. This is an indication
of the high affinity of the methanogens toward palmitic acid-rich
substrates for better biomethane yields.

Regardless  of  the  advantageous  nature  of  FOG  supplementa-
tion, operational failures created concerns in continuous wastew-
ater  sludge  digesters.  Acetoclastic  methanogenic  inhibition  has
been well documented and was attributed to LCFAs accumulation
[16,137] . LCFAs of FOG could accumulate on the surface of sludge
particles and microbes, making them hydrophobic which increase

34

sludge floatation, scum formation, and washout from the digesters
instead of utilization. A high organic loading of FOG could be detri-
mental to process stability due to rapid acidification through β-
oxidation  of  LCFAs  [140] .  Increment  of  acetate  concentration  in
the digester can decrease the pH from its optimum level and in-
hibit the methanogenic activity. Optimization and proper control
of the process parameters are required for effective utilization of
FOG during ACD.

4.1. Potential of worldwide biomethane production from FOG

Pilot experiments have corroborated laboratory experiments in-
dicating the increase in biogas production with the utilization of
FOG  as  a  co-substrate.  Less  than  10% of WWTPs  in  the  US  pro-
duce biogas for beneficial use [57] . Case studies of co-digestion of
biosolids with organic wastes at field-scale indicated that the use
of  co-digestion  could  overcome  significant  economic  challenges.
These findings could provide guidance in retrofitting existing fa-
cilities or in designing new biogas production facilities. Evaluation
of ACD at WWTPs ranging from 1 to 375 million gallons per day
(MGD)  determined  the  potential  feasibility  for  different  types  of
digester operation, organic waste, and loading rate as well as the
energy self-sufficiency in WWTPs.

FOG  has  been  co-digested  in  an  anaerobic  digester  near
mesophilic  conditions  (35–42 °C)  with  high  organic  loading  to
the  digester.  FOG  also  have  the  ability  to  produce  the  highest
4 kg −1 VS) compared to other sub-
biomethane yield (ca. 10 0 0 L CH
strates, whereas sewage sludge alone has a biomethane yield rang-
4 kg −1 VS. A list of full-scale WWTPs in
ing from 240 to 340 L CH
the USA and Europe endeavoring to achieve energy self-sufficiency
utilizing FOG as a co-substrate is presented in Table 6 . Some of the
major plants are discussed herein. The Hyperion Water Reclama-
tion Plant is one of the oldest and largest wastewater treatment
facilities in the USA. It processes an average dry-weather flow of
370  MGD  of  wastewater  and  has  a  dry-weather  capacity  of  450
MGD. The plant implemented a 76,0 0 0 L d −1  pilot facility to in-
vestigate the influence of FOG addition on the performance of AD.
A 2.5 million-gallons of FOG was fed to a thermophilic pilot di-
gester. Pilot facility tests held at Hyperion Treatment Plant, Califor-
nia (U.S.A.), showed great improvement in biogas production with
the addition of FOG [141] . Although the digester was loaded with
15% VS, the average increase in gas production was as high as 31%.
This equates to roughly US$ 35,438 in savings to the facility ob-
tained by producing its own energy with FOG digestion. Greves-
muhlen WWTP in Germany uses 30% grease skimming sludge for
its  co-digestion  with  mixed  sludge  (WAS:PS = 60:10)  at  a  diges-
tion rate of 1840 tons of total solid year −1 . Millbrae WWTP in CA,
U.S.A., utilizes waste activated sludge and a FOG ratio of 9.3:1 with
HRT of 38–58 days in a mesophilic reactor. Essex Junction WWTP
also utilized FOG with sludge, and brewery and oil wastes. Gre-
sham WWTP in OR, U.S.A., uses a ratio of approximately 20:3 for
sludge to FOG mixing in mesophilic digestion in 18 days of opera-
tion. All of these processes required 25–50 days for FOG biodegra-
dation depending upon the concentration of FOG during digestion.
Despite all these effort s in industrial scale operations, several
operational issues were observed. The LCFAs in the FOG coagulated
with  the  substrates,  resulting  in  low  accessibility  and  occasional
scum formation and sludge flotation. Rapid accumulation of VFAs
in the digester created pH fluctuations as well. Process failures ob-
served at elevated FOG loading rates have restricted the digesters
to achieve the expected (theoretical) yield of biomethane during
FOG co-digestion with municipal wastewater sludge. The threshold
values for FOG loading to decrease biomethane yields during co-
digestion are ranging between 0.4 to 2.1 g VS L −1  d −1 . Similarly,
full scale FOG co-digestion is an excellent alternative to improve
the biogas productivity at WWTPs. A report by the United States

Environmental Protection Agency [142] described the case of six
WWTPs where co-digestion helped to increase biogas production
from  40  to  300%,  including  five  plants  using  FOG  as  one  of  the
sources of co-substrates ( Table 6 ).

4.2. Optimum conditions for co-digestion

4.2.1. Temperature

Temperature  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  degradation  of  sub-
strates  and  the  digestion  process.  Thermophilic  temperature  is
preferential  for  better  hydrolysis,  digestion  and  decreasing  the
pathogenic  load  inside  the  digester  [143] .  Higher  biomethane
yield (197 vs. 152 mL g −1  VS) was observed during thermophilic
(52 °C) digestion compared with mesophilic digestion (35 °C) [144] .
Nguyen  et  al.  [145]  witnessed  an  increase  in  biogas  production
(16.4%) along with 6.88% improvement in the VS reduction from
Korean food waste in thermophilic digestion (55 °C). Digester per-
formance  was  stable  and  faster  during  100  days  of  operation  at
55 °C than 38 °C. A 112.7% improvement in biomethane production
was  observed  (compared  to  the  control)  for  a  high  FOG  loading
(60% VS) during hyper-thermophilic (70 °C) ACD followed by ther-
mophilic digestion (55 °C). The hyper-thermophilic temperature in-
creases the hydrolysis rate of the co-substrates for better solubility
[136] . Dong et al. [146] explained the effect of hyper-thermophilic
temperature  on  the  increased  hydrolysis  rate  of  WAS  for  better
biomethane yields.

Anaerobic  digestion  of  oil-extracted  marine  microalgae  Nan-
nochloropsis gaditana biomass showed increased solubility in ther-
mophilic conditions compared to mesophilic conditions. However,
there was less improvement in biomethane productivity compared
to mesophilic condition over 120 days [147] . Co-digestion of mi-
croalgal biomass with PS and WAS showed better biomethane pro-
ductivity at a mesophilic temperature than a thermophilic temper-
ature. The rapid degradation of microalgal protein resulted in am-
monia inhibition of the methanogens, leading to poor biomethane
yield during thermophilic digestion [148] . The temperature of the
co-digestion process significantly influences the hydrolysis and sol-
ubilization  of  a  co-substrate,  improving  biomethane  yields.  Al-
though, thermophilic temperature increases the hydrolysis rate of
the substrate, ammonia inhibition of the methanogens can be a se-
rious problem during FOG co-digestion. One effective approach to
avoid this inhibition is to use a dual stage digester where acido-
genic (hydrolysis) phase reactor can be operated at thermophilic
temperature and methanogenic phase reactor can be operated at
mesophilic temperature which can increase the overall process ef-
ficiency.

4.2.2. Carbon-nitrogen (C/N) ratio

The C/N ratio is an essential factor in AD, and it depends on
the  presence  of  carbonaceous  and  proteinaceous  substrates.  Im-
proper C/N ratios lead to process failure due to higher ammonifica-
tion [149] and/or VFAs production. A better performance of anaer-
obic microbes was observed at a C/N ratio near 25 in anaerobic
digesters [150] . A proper balance of carbon-rich substrates in the
digester  could  be  essential  for  maintaining  an  effective  C/N  ra-
tio for a longer period. Use of carbonaceous substrates was rec-
ommended with wastewater sludge for better performance of di-
gesters, as sludge alone has a low C/N ratio (5–10) [13, 151–153] .
Being rich in carbon, FOG could be a better choice for maintain-
ing the C/N ratio during the digestion process. Addition of FOG to
wastewater sludge retained the desired C/N ratio for over 180 days
and improved the biogas yield by 35% with an increase in aceto-
clastic methanogen ( Methanosaeta ) population in the digester [13] .
The amount of required carbonaceous substrates was adjusted de-
pending on the initial C/N ratio of sludge to be digested. Haider
et al. [154] observed the effect of mixing ratio, where the highest

biogas yield of 584 L kg −1  VS was obtained at a C/N ratio of 20.
On the other side, a higher organic loading of FOG increased the
VFAs production due to nitrogen deficiency, leading to process fail-
ure. FOG utilization could be an effective choice to increase biogas
yields if the properties of the sludge and the mixing ratio of FOG
to sludge have been adjusted to maintain a balanced C/N ratio.

4.2.3. Suspension pH

The growth of methanogenic organisms and their activity occur
in an optimum pH range of 6–8 [155] . Acidophilic and alkaliphilic
methanogens  need  pH  ranges  of  5.6–6.2  and  8–9.2,  respectively,
for high growth and biomethane production [156] . The desired pH
of AD should be maintained in the range of 6.5–7.6 for high pro-
cess efficiency [143] . Commercial digesters in WWTP facilities usu-
ally maintain a pH in the range of 7.4–8.3 [ 136 , 145 , 151 , 157 ]. Rapid
degradation of FOG to acetate during acidogenesis/acetogenesis can
result in a drop of pH. Addition of buffering agents and micronu-
trients could maintain the pH at its optimum level for effective di-
gestion [158] .

4.2.4. Micronutrients

The effective growth of anaerobic microorganisms requires sev-
eral micronutrients along with main substrates for enzymatic ac-

tions. Obligate anaerobic Clostridium expresses hydrogenase, which
promotes hydrogen evolution during acetate metabolism. Iron is a
co-factor of the hydrogenase to mediate the activity between hy-
drogenase  and  nicotinamide  adenine  dinucleotide  (NADH)  ferre-
doxin reductase during acidogenesis. An increase in hydrogenase
activity  was  observed  with  an  increase  in  FeSO
4  concentration
to  10.9 mg  L −1 ,  providing  the  hydrogen  yield  up  to  41.6 L  day −1
4  concentration of 300 mg L −1  improved the hydro-
[159] . A FeSO
2  mol −1  glucose with the highest acetate
gen yield to 2.15 mol H
concentration  of  3.87 g  L −1  in  24 h  [160] .  The  deficiency  of  iron
resulted  in  low  hydrogen  yield,  and  a  further  increase  in  FeCl
2
concentration  to  800 mg  L −1  accelerated  the  hydrogen  produc-
tion with elevated production of acetate [161] ; whereas, the sup-
plementation  of  zero  valent  iron  in  the  anaerobic  digestion  en-
hanced  the  acetogenesis  for  conversion  of  propionate  [162] .  En-
hancement  of  acidogenesis  could  be  effective  for  the  degrada-
tion  of  FOG  to  acetate  for  biomethane  production.  In  addition,
amendment  of  iron(III)  at  4th  day  after  the  start-up  of  digester
reduced the odorous hydrogen sulfide (H
2 S) by 65% [162] . Thus,
iron  supplementation  has  potential  effects  on  the  digestion  pro-
cess and can provide better productivity of biomethane as a final
product.

The  growth  and  performance  of  several  methanogenic  organ-
isms  require  nickel(II)  for  the  synthesis  of  co-factor  F
430 ,  which
is the prosthetic group of methyl coenzyme M reductase involved
in the reduction of acetate to biomethane [163,164] . Supplemen-
tation  of  nickel  (10 mg  L −1 )  stimulated  acetate  utilization  up  to
50 g  L −1  d −1 ,  which  was  15  times  higher  than  the  conventional
high-rate digestion [165] indicating a significant role of nickel on
acetate utilization and subsequent biomethane production. Cobalt
(II) is another microelement required for stable and effective di-
gester performance. Addition of cobalt (0.2 mg L −1 ) at the initial
stage allowed higher organic loading rate (5.0 g VS. L −1 day −1 ) and
improved acetate conversion to biomethane in a digester for 490
days [158] . Cobalt at a concentration of 1.0 mg L −1 with iron (10 mg
L −1 ) and nickel (1.0 mg L −1 ) enhanced the degradation of propi-
onate to acetate, and increased the final biogas yield [164] . Effec-
tive co-digestion of FOG to biomethane also requires the initial ac-
etate production from LCFAs and further conversion to biomethane.
Thus, cobalt supplementation with iron and nickel could be effec-
tive  for  the  enhancement  of  biomethane  production  at  high  or-
ganic loading of FOG in ACD.

is from digester gas, the net savings in purchased electrical power
would be approximately US$ 40 0,0 0 0 year −1 ( Table 7 ).

The financial benefits of a co-digestion facility are strongly de-
pendent on the waste characteristics, cost of digestion, and cost of
waste disposal after digestion. Organic wastes such as food wastes
and FOG can be digested separately or with municipal wastewater
sludges because, these have a high VS ( > 80%) and digest well with
a high VS reduction over 80%. Comparatively, cow manure has a VS
of ∼80%, however has a low VS reduction ( < 40%). Thus, FOG is a
much more desirable organic waste for co-digestion than cow ma-
nure [170] . These different waste characteristics have a strong in-
fluence on the economics with respect to cost of biosolids process-
ing after digestion and the amount of biogas produced. The tip-
ping fee for FOG is negative, indicating that the economic benefits
of receiving FOG are greater than the costs. Results from an eco-
nomic analysis showed that co-digestion using existing digesters
at a municipal wastewater reclamation facility is more economi-
cal than building new digesters. Co-digestion is more economical
at facilities with high electricity costs and low cost of residual dis-
posals.

4.2.5. Other parameters

Several other factors can influence on FOG digestibility and fi-
nal biomethane yield. The performance of anaerobic digesters and
the specific biomethane production rate were stable for FOG co-
digestion at a volumetric ratio of 0.2% to wastewater sludge at HRT
of 30 days. A gradual decrease in HRT at the same volumetric ra-
tio negatively affected the biomethane yield due to the adsorption
of FOG onto wastewater sludge, impeding the degradation of the
substrate [166] . Co-digestion of oily waste with cow manure and
food waste showed a positive impact on biomethane production
oil L −1 for
and VS removal at high oil concentrations up to 15 g COD
nearly 200 days; however, a further increase in oil concentration
impaired reactor performance [167] . There are two possible rea-
sons to explain the digester failure; (1) the accumulation of lipids
onto the sludge particles inhibits accessibility and utilization, caus-
ing sludge flotation and washout from the digester [16,137] , and (2)
a decrease in initial nitrogen-rich substrates (i.e., cow manure-food
waste) in the digester cannot maintain the desired C/N ratio [168] .
The concentration of FOG loading and HRT play a critical role in
FOG co-digestion and continuous biomethane production.

4.3. Economic feasibility of anaerobic co-digestion of FOG

The characteristics of three digester feedstocks along with di-
gester parameters and financial benefits after the use of FOG as
a co-substrate at the Douglas L. Smith Middle Basin Wastewater
Treatment Plant (DLSMB WWTP) are listed in Table 7 . The DLSMB
WWTP is a large power service customer of KCPL, the local electric
utility. The monthly bills from KCPL reflect a total of four charge
categories: customer, facilities, demand, and energy [169] . The cap-
ital cost of the co-digestion and co-generation systems accounted
for ∼55% of the US$ 17.8 million solids improvement project for
the DLSMB WWTP. The FOG receiving station was open for com-
mercial operation at the start of August 2011. During the first three
months of operation, the facility established and processed ∼1 mil-
lion gallons of FOG, resulting in the receipt of US$ 75,0 0 0 tipping
fees and a revenue of about US$ 30 0,0 0 0 year −1 . The purchased
electrical  power  savings  for  the  initial  few  months  of  operation
were hard to quantify as the supervisory control and data acqui-
sition (SCADA) system did not offer a totalizer for produced power.
The  equivalent  unit  power  cost  is  approximately  US$  0.06  per
kWhr. During August to October 2011, a single combined heat and
power (CHP) unit was operated at maximum capacity with an up-
time of ca. 90%. At this production rate, the unit provided an an-
nual output of ca. 8,360,0 0 0 kWhr. If 80% of the produced power

5. Challenges and future prospects

According  to  the  literature  and  the  outcomes  from  pilot  and
full-size industrial plants, co-digestion of FOG with sludge has re-
cently gained big attention. Addition of FOG to sludge has many
benefits,  including  diversion  of  organic  waste  from  landfills,  im-
proved renewable energy through biogas production, and potential
revenue for tipping fees. There are some barriers to widen the ap-
plication of FOG co-digestion. The following points summarize the
challenges and future prospects.

(1) Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are known to degrade via the β-
oxidation  pathway.  However,  unsaturated  fatty  acids  (USFAs)
must be first converted to SFAs. Additional research is required
to identify the initial stages in the degradation pathway of US-
FAs that can lead to a specific pretreatment or reactor configu-
ration based on the SFAs and USFAs contents present in FOG.
The  information  of  the  fatty  acids  composition  of  FOG  used
in AD in literature is limited ( Table 1 ). A more comprehensive
sampling effort and characterization are necessary to determine
the types of fatty acids and their esters present in FOG. Such
characterization  should  be  coupled  with  a  FOG  management
strategy of municipalities to determine any potential links be-
tween the waste management and digestibility of FOG.

(2) Studies  on  the  optimization  of  C/N  ratio  and  addition  of  es-
sential micronutrients (such as iron, nickel and cobalt) during
co-digestion of FOG are required to facilitate the growth of ef-
fective lipid-degrading microbial community and simultaneous
degradation of FOG. Ultrasonication and hydrodynamic cavita-
tion  have  been  used  to  remove  scum  during  ACD  of  lipidic-
waste at the lab-scale and pilot-scale. However, the addition of
such units to full-scale in WWTPs can be suggested.

(3) The  expression  of  specific  microbial  enzymes  involved  in  the
β-oxidation  and  methanogenesis  pathways  needs  reinvestiga-
tion using metabolomics for mechanistic understanding of FOG
degradation and subsequent utilization. Enhancement of enzy-
matic  expressions  though  microbial  adaptation  to  FOG  could
further increase the performance of the ACD.

(4) Most studies used FOG as a co-substrate in AD without appro-
priate  pretreatment,  which  can  cause  failure  in  the  digestion
with low efficiency of biogas yields. Partial pretreatment of FOG
in a separate reactor and the use of acclimatized consortium
could  facilitate  the  digestibility  of  FOG  and  its  utilization  for
biomethanation ( Fig. 8 ).

(5) To  date,  most  inhibition  tests  have  been  carried  out  on  syn-
thetic fatty acids (such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic or a mix-
ture of pure fatty acids). Some studies have shown a synergis-
tic influence where the methanogenic inhibition due to multi-
ple fatty acids is more severe than that with single fatty acids.
Additional laboratory experimental tests are required to deter-
mine the effect of FOG (as FOG is composed of various LCFAs)
on the microbial community. Such experiments may provide in-
sights into the determination of the inhibition level of FOG in
ACD and reveal how this inhibition can vary with reactor con-
figuration.

(6) The lack of knowledge about some uncultured bacteria is an ob-
stacle when dealing with complex anaerobic consortia. The mi-
crobial population is affected by the addition of co-substrates.
Substrate  diversification  causes  robustness  in  the  microbial
community. However, more knowledge of the divergence of the
microbial population after the addition of co-substrates such as
FOG  is  required  for  a  better  understanding  of  population  ki-
netics, microbial stability, and product yields. The stability of
a particular microbial community and its diversity (with opti-
mization of operational parameters) could help to improve the
performance of ACD and the stability of digesters in WWTPs.

6. Conclusions

A critical assessment of current status of FOG co-digestion was
discussed based on the recent publications, with an emphasis of
challenges encountered during the operation process, pretreatment
approaches, and metagenomic analysis. Laboratory, pilot, and full-
scale  investigations  on  FOG  co-digestion  with  sludge  have  been
conducted across the globe. The results of these studies showed
that the addition of FOG significantly increased biomethane pro-
duction. Improvement in biomethane production depends on the
concentration of FOG loading, mixing intensity, reactor configura-
tion, and operation conditions (including temperature, pH, C/N ra-
tio, and micronutrients). Chemical pretreatment and acclimatized
microflora can be a potential approach to overcome the inhibition
of FOG and subsequently increase the biomethane production.

El-Sayed Salama received his B.Sc. degree in Faculty of
Sciences at Benha University, Egypt in 2008 and M.Sc.
and Ph.D. degrees in Earth Resources and Environmen-
tal  Engineering  from  Hanyang  University,  Seoul,  South
Korea in 2016 under the guidance of Prof. Byong Hun
Jeon. His doctoral research was focused on application of
different wastewaters (including municipal, concentrated,
and piggery wastewaters) in photobioreactors (PBRs) for
biomass  and  biofuel  production,  enhancement  of  mi-
croalgal growth by application of various abiotic factors
(CO 2 ,  flue  gases,  phytohormones,  and  salt  stress)  and
biocomponent-based transformations for improved bio-
fuel recovery. He also developed a new approach for co-
agulation/flocculation of microalgal biomass using acid mine drainage (AMD) as
source of Fe(II)/Al(III). He is currently working as an Assistant Professor in the De-
partment of Earth Resources and Environmental Engineering at Hanyang University,
Seoul, South Korea. His current research includes composting and anaerobic co-
digestion of fats, oil, grease (FOG) to boost the biomethane production in wastewa-
ter treatment plants (WWTPs).

anaerobic fermentation and digestion of organic wastes
for the production of bio-hydrogen and bio-methane. He
is also developing microbial fermentation technologies for
the improved production of liquid biofuels (e.g., butyrate,
caproate) from organic wastes. His research outcomes and
the developed microbial technologies could be effective for the industrialization of
bioenergy production and simultaneous waste management for better environmen-
tal protection.

Mayur Kurade earned his Ph.D. degree in 2012 from the
Shivaji University, Kolhapur, India for his in-depth investi-
gation on the biodegradation of xenobiotic synthetic dyes
and bioremediation of textile industry wastewater using
microbial catalysts. After completion of PhD, he joined
ARCPE lab at Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong
as a postdoctoral fellow. He conducted applied micro-
bial research for the production of biogenic flocculant and
its application in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
to upgrade the existing bioleaching methods of sewage
sludge. Following this research profile, he joined Hanyang
University, Seoul, South Korea in 2015 as Assistant Pro-
fessor. Currently he is developing cost-effective fermenta-
tion technologies to improve the yield of biofuels from various organic sources. He
is also conducting co-digestion of waste biomass to find a remedy of solid waste
management along with an enhance the biogas yield. Moreover, he is exploring the
bioremediation of emerging- organic, xenobiotic pollutants from wastewater using
microbial catalysts. His specific research interests include biodegradation, bioreme-
diation, environmental microbiology, bioenergy, and biofuels. His research outcomes
and the developed technologies are very helpful for the pollution control planning,
management of water contamination, and environmental protection.

Subhabrata Dev received his Master degree in Biotech-
nology at Osmania University, India in 2009 and his Ph.D.
in  Environmental  Engineering  from  Indian  Institute  of
Technology, Kharagpur, India in 2016. His doctoral the-
sis focused on the development of cost-effective nitro-
gen source to improve the passive treatment of sulfate
and metal-rich industrial wastewater, where he developed

source for sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). Supplementa-
tion of MWE into SRB consortia enhanced their activity
and significantly improved the passive treatment of sul-
fate and metal-rich wastewater. His doctoral research has
created a potential aspect towards development of a sus-
tainable technology that couples the utilization of organic wastes for the treatment
of inorganic wastewater. Dev did his Postdoctoral Research in Hanyang University,
South Korea on the topic of sewage sludge and FOG waste co-digestion for im-
proved biomethane productivity. Basically, his research interests include bioreme-
diation, bioenergy, and biogeochemistry.
