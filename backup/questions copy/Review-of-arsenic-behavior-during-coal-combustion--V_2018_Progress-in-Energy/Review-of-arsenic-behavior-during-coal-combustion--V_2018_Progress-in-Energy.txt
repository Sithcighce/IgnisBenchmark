Growing public awareness of the environmental impact of coal combustion has raised serious concerns
about the various hazardous trace elements produced by coal firing. Arsenic deserves special attention due
to its toxicity, volatility, bioaccumulation in the environment, and potential carcinogenic properties. As the
main anthropogenic source of arsenic is coal combustion, its behavior in power plants is of concern. Unlike
mercury, arsenic behavior in coal combustion has not been subjected to systematic, in-depth research. Dif-
ferent researchers have reached opposing conclusions about the behavior of arsenic in combustion systems
and, as yet, there is relatively little research on arsenic removal technologies.

In this paper, the volatilization, transformation, and emission behavior of arsenic and its removal technol-
ogies are discussed in depth. Factors affecting the volatilization characteristics of arsenic are summarized,
including temperature, pressure, mode of occurrence of arsenic, coal rank, mineral matter, and the sulfur
and chlorine content of the fuel. The behavior of arsenic during oxy-fuel combustion and the effect of com-
bustion atmosphere (O2, CO2, SO2 and H2O(g)) are also reviewed in detail.

In order to better understand the pathways of arsenic in a power plant environment, a particular focus in
this work is the transformation mechanism of ultra-fine ash particles and the partitioning behavior of arse-
nic. Finally, the effects of air pollution control devices (APCDs) on arsenic emissions are examined, along
with the effectiveness of flue gas arsenic removal technologies with different kinds of adsorbents, including
calcium-based adsorbents, metal oxides, activated carbon, and fly ash.

1. Introduction

2. Arsenic in coal

Although renewable and nuclear energy sources are becoming
increasingly important for our future energy demand, coal combus-
tion is still the dominant source for power generation in the energy
mix in the foreseeable future. With increasing public awareness of
the environmental impact of coal combustion, serious concerns have
been raised regarding the emissions of various hazardous trace ele-
ments from power plants, such as mercury, arsenic, lead, and cad-
mium [1]. Among the most harmful elements, arsenic is
receiving increasing attention due to its toxicity, volatility, bioac-
cumulation in the environment (enriched in biomass such as in
[2(cid:1)4]), and potential carcinogenic
hyperaccumulator plants
properties. Arsenic can affect the gastrointestinal tract, circula-
tory system, liver, kidneys, and skin [5]. Nearly all types of arse-
nic compounds are toxic, with As3+ being 50 times more toxic
than As5+. Inorganic arsenic exposure in humans is also strongly
associated with lung cancer, while ingestion of inorganic arsenic
Incidents of adverse health risks

resulting from arsenic contamination in the environment have
been reported in many countries. It has been reported that more
than 3000 cases of arseniasis in villages in Guizhou (a typical
area of arsenic contamination in China, which can also be found
in other parts of the world) were caused by the use of locally
mined high-arsenic coal. In addition, arsenic is the main cause of
denitrification catalyst poisoning in selective catalytic reduction
(SCR) systems [7(cid:1)9]. In 2011, the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) [10] announced the first formal nationwide regula-
tory standard to “limit toxic gas emissions of power plants”,
including an emission limitation for arsenic. Subsequently,
in
2016, the EPA [11] published the latest national emission stand-
ards for hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired electric
utility steam generating units. The emission limits for arsenic in
various sources are listed in Table 1 below.

These strict emission limits underscore the need to study the vol-
atility and transformation behavior of arsenic during coal combus-
tion.

2.1. Concentration of arsenic in coals around the world

The concentrations of arsenic in coals around the world are
shown in Table 2. Due to the differences in post-depositional pro-
cesses and coalification processes [12(cid:1)17], large variations in arse-
nic content occur.

Although for most coals the average concentration of arsenic is
0.5(cid:1)80 mg/g [15], some, for example those in southwestern China,
have an extremely high concentration. The flue gas generated by
high-arsenic coals may cause serious poisoning and deactivation of
the SCR catalysts. Moreover, dispersion of arsenic-enriched fly ash
can also contaminate soil and groundwater with resultant local arse-
nic poisoning.

2.2. Speciation of arsenic

Arsenic in coal occurs in three dominant forms: pyrite, organic,
and arsenate [31(cid:1)33]. Chen et al. [34] analyzed 147 Chinese coal
samples from different coal-forming ages and ranks, and found that
inorganic arsenic mainly occurred with sulfur in pyrite, especially as
a substitute for sulfur in pyrite-type compounds [35(cid:1)38]. Using
chemical analyses from an electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA),
Savage et al. [39] suggested most arsenic was present in solid solu-
tion in pyrite, rather than in micro-inclusions of separate arsenic
phases. Filby et al. [40] found that arsenic was always associated
with inorganic elements. However, Goodarzi [41(cid:1)43] suggested that
for some Canadian coals arsenic had an organic association, while a
strong organic association for arsenic was also suggested for a Texas
lignite [44]. Factor analysis of 350 shale samples from the Illinois
coal basin revealed association of arsenic with pyrite and organic
matter [45].

Guo et al. [46] chose three Chinese coals to study the thermal sta-
bilities of arsenic. Yunnan (YN) coal contained much more arsenic
and sulfur than Datong (DT) and Yima (YM) coals. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) results showed that the main mineral components in DT and

YM coals were quartz and silicates, and in YN coal were pyrite and
arsenopyrite. This was demonstrated by using scanning electron
microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) (Fig. 1(a)) and
Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) techni-
ques (Fig. 1(b)). Note that the tested char sample was obtained after
four extraction steps, in which the speciation of ion exchangeable,
arsenic bound to carbonates, arsenic bound to Fe(cid:1)Mn oxides and
organic-bound had been removed. The arsenic remaining in the
residual product included arsenic associated with detrital silicate,
aluminosilicate minerals, resistant sulfur compounds, and refractory
organic materials [46].

The valence state of arsenic in coal was also studied to determine
its possible speciation. Zhao et al. [47] found that arsenic occurred as
arsenate and arsenite, rather than in the form of sulfide or other
arsenic-containing minerals. In addition, X-ray absorption near edge
structure (XANES) spectrum of arsenic in a Wyodak coal sample
showed that the arsenic in the coal consisted of about 50% As3+
(assumed to be carboxyl bound) and 50% arsenate [48]. With XANES
spectroscopy, Shah et al. [49] found 65% As5+, 25% As3+ and 10% arse-
nic/pyrite in a representative bituminous coal from a power station
in New South Wales, Australia. For a bituminous coal in a Canadian
power plant, arsenic in raw coal was reported to be dominated by
arsenate (54%), arsenical pyrite (FeAsS) (24%) and an arsenite (As+3
(cid:1)(cid:1)O) species (12%) [50].

Regardless of the variation of arsenic content and occurrence
forms in different coals, it is generally accepted that pyrite-associ-
ated arsenic represents the major occurrence of arsenic in coal. The
ratio of arsenic speciation in decreasing order is pyritic > arse-
nate > organic, and in terms of the valence state: As5+ > As3+.

3. Factors affecting arsenic volatilization during coal combustion

The volatilization behavior of arsenic is closely linked to the
devolatilization and char combustion processes, which are highly

affected by the composition of a coal (as expressed in terms of ulti-
mate/proximate analysis, minerals, and S and Cl content), the arsenic
content in coal and the mode in which it occurs, and the surrounding
environment (temperature, atmosphere, pressure) [51(cid:1)56].

3.1. Temperature

Clarke [57] noted that temperature was the main factor affecting
arsenic volatilization in coal. The current consensus is that the vola-
tilization proportion of arsenic
increases with temperature
[46,52,55(cid:1)60]. Senior et al. [56] reported that in bench-scale com-
bustion experiments using bituminous and subbituminous pulver-
ized coals, 40% to 80% of the initial arsenic content was vaporized at
1150 °C. Based on the concentrations of arsenic in the coal and bot-
tom ash, Senior et al. [61] calculated the volatility of arsenic from
eight pulverized coal power plants and found the degree of vaporiza-
tion varied from 55% to 98% in the combustion zone (1400(cid:1)1500 °C).
In a study by Liu et al. [62], seven coals with different ranks were
burned in a high-temperature tube furnace and 54% to 99% of the ini-
tial arsenic in the coals was found to completely vaporize during
the combustion process (1500 °C). However, Zeng [63] found that
only 36% on average of the initial arsenic in 23 coals vaporized
in a laboratory-scale combustion system at 1480 °C with 20% O2
[63].

The temperature-staged volatilization characteristics of arsenic

as reported in the literature [46,52,59,62,64], are given in Table 3.

in different

Table 3 shows that the volatilization characteristics of arsenic are
temperature ranges. To better
markedly different
describe the staged volatility behavior, the volatilization rate of arse-
nic was calculated over the range 25(cid:1)1500 °C (where 25 °C stands
for the ambient condition when no arsenic is volatilized) in the work
of Liu et al. [62] (see Fig. 2). For all the coals in Fig. 2, two mass loss
peaks of arsenic loss and three temperature zones were observed to
be important: <600 °C, 600(cid:1)1000 °C, and >1000 °C.

No consistent conclusions have been reached on the staged tem-
perature zones (Table 3), which may be due to differences in coal
type, experimental parameters and other factors. Further research is
needed to determine how specific arsenic compounds behave at dif-
ferent temperature ranges, as well as the possible factors affecting
this behavior.

Shen et al. [65] tested the temporal volatilization rate of arsenic
in a fluidized bed with an on-line analysis system of trace elements
in flue gas. The system allowed continuous monitoring of the

vaporized arsenic based on inductively-coupled plasma optical
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The experimental scheme is
shown in Fig. 3.

The release rate of arsenic over time is shown in Fig. 4. Results
showed that temperature had a significant positive effect and that as
temperature increased from 600 to 850 °C, the release rate of arsenic
became more rapid with a resulting higher releasing peak. At the
same time, the peak time was shortened due to more intense com-
bustion taking place. A similar phenomenon was observed by Liu

et al. [66], who also studied the temporal volatilization of arsenic by
changing the residence time of the raw coal.

Similarly, Wang and Tomita [55] suggested that arsenic was sig-
nificantly volatilized during combustion at a rapid heating rate of
500 °C/min, whereas only minimal quantities were emitted during
combustion with a slow heating rate of 5(cid:1)10 °C/min, indicating that
heating rate also affects arsenic volatilization. Moreover, to date the
majority of combustion experiments have been conducted at tem-
peratures below 1100 °C due to the temperature limitations imposed
by conventional tube furnaces. By contrast, the combustion temper-
ature in a pulverized-coal boiler is generally above 1400 °C and the
heating rate can be as high as 500 °C/s. This clearly indicates that fur-
ther study on the effects of heating rate is required to evaluate vola-
tilization characteristics at high temperatures and provide reference
data for power plants.

3.2. Mode of occurrence of arsenic in coal

While it is clear from the above that the proportions of arsenic
volatilized in coals can vary considerably in the combustion zone
(1400(cid:1)1500 °C), it is reasonable to assume that this is related to the
chemical speciation of the arsenic and its mode of occurrence in the
coal.

In the study by Guo et al. [46], the arsenic in coals and the coal-
derived pyrolysis chars were classified into five forms:
ion
exchangeable, carbonates-bound, Fe(cid:1)(cid:1)Mn oxide-bound, organic
matter-bound, and arsenic remaining in residue. Compared to raw
coal, the decreased arsenic found in the forms bound to organic

matter and bound to Fe(cid:1)(cid:1)Mn oxides in the chars produced at 1000 °C
suggested that arsenic in these forms was unstable during pyrolysis.
Moreover, some of the arsenic remaining in the char residue could be
expected to vaporize during pyrolysis at 1000 °C. Bool and Helble [58]
reported that pyritic arsenic vaporized along with the decomposition
of pyrite to pyrrhotite, and the organically bound arsenic vaporized
along with coal devolatilization. Arsenic in beneficiated Pittsburgh No.
8 coal existed partly combined with pyrite and partly in other chemi-
cal forms that were soluble in dilute HCl (including ion-exchanged
arsenic) [58]. According to Liu et al. [67], arsenic in coal was divided
into exchangeable, organic, sulfide and residual. With the sequential
chemical extraction method [67], the modes of occurrence of arsenic
in coals and ash were determined [60] and used to explain the staged
volatility behavior of arsenic. Taking Kaiyuan (KY) coal (lignite,
Yunnan province, China) as an example, the speciation ratios of arse-
nic in raw coal and ash are shown in Fig. 5.

Using the speciation transformation results of arsenic at different
temperatures in Fig. 5, Liu et al. [62] concluded that arsenic that
vaporized at lower than 600 °C was mainly organically bound, while
arsenic vaporized at 800(cid:1)900 °C was mainly due to the decomposi-
tion or oxidation of arsenic in sulfide forms. However, due to the
lack of proven and reliable technology to study arsenic adsorption
and the lack of temperature programming desorption similar to that
available for mercury speciation determination, the specific arsenic
compounds corresponding to different temperature zones have not
been finally determined.

It is generally accepted that exchangeable and organic-bound
arsenic are easily vaporized during the devolatilization of coal, and

ferent rank of coals ((a) transformation of coal to char, (b) transformation of char to

arsenic bound to Fe(cid:1)(cid:1)Mn oxides and pyrite is unstable and tends to
vaporize at temperatures lower than 1000 °C, while arsenates are
very stable and usually decompose at relatively high temperatures.
In this case, it can be expected that coals with a large proportion of
unstable arsenic compounds will have higher volatilization ratios at
a specific temperature, while arsenic in coals with a large number of
stable arsenates is difficult to vaporize at low temperatures.

3.3. Coal rank

The effect of coal rank on the volatilization of arsenic is complex.
The sequential extraction results of Liu et al. [62] indicated that coals
with lower rank tended to have a higher proportion of arsenic spe-
cies that more easily vaporized, which resulted in the higher arsenic
volatilization ratio of lignite coals than anthracite under the same
temperature conditions [62]. However, according to Senior et al.
[61] who summarized the testing results of several full-scale plants
equipped with different boiler types and coals, no obvious relation-
ship was found between arsenic volatility and coal rank. For exam-
ple, the vaporized fraction of arsenic was 55.2% when burning lignite
while 74.3% when burning subbituminous coal based on the same
tangential boiler type [61]. Liu et al. [68] studied the pyrolysis pro-
cess of coal during underground coal gasification. In their work, the
arsenic content from coal to char, and coal to ash were both tested.
For the first process (coal to char), it was found that from coal to
char, arsenic volatility was highest for lignite, with bituminous coal
next, and anthracite being the least volatile (Fig. 6). The main reason
appeared to be that lignite had the highest content of volatiles,
which promoted rapid coal combustion and oxygen diffusion into
the char pores, thus improving the reaction rates and trace element
volatilization. For the second process (coal to ash), they suggested
that over the entire volatility range from coal to char to ash, coal
rank had little effect on final arsenic volatilization. As can be seen in
Fig. 6, the volatilization ratio of arsenic was approximately 60% for
both anthracite and bituminous coal, while a smaller volatilization
ratio was obtained in lignite. In the study of Liu et al. [62], instead of

dividing according to coal rank, coals were divided into two groups:
arsenic >4 mg/g and arsenic <4 mg/g. Results showed that at a given
temperature the group with the higher arsenic concentration tended
to have larger arsenic volatility levels.

3.4. Mineral matter

Many researchers have investigated the effects of different
metallic elements (Ca, Fe, Mg, Al, Na, K and others) on arsenic volatil-
ization and tried to develop correlations between arsenic and these
elements. It is widely accepted that Ca inhibits the volatilization of
arsenic [54,58,69(cid:1)71]. Jadhav and Fan [71] studied the adsorption of
arsenic in the gas phase by CaO, and determined using XRD that
Ca3(AsO4)2 and Ca3As2O7 were formed. However, the existence of
the two compounds needs to be confirmed in future experiments. Lu
et al. [59] compared the arsenic behavior in YimaD (a demineralized
sample of Yima) coal with and without CaO addition. The effects of
CaO on arsenic volatility are shown in Table 4.

compounds

of As(cid:1)(cid:1)Ca

It appears that the capture efficiency of CaO depended on the
pyrolysis temperature and increased from 3.8% at 600 °C to 23.4% at
800 °C. This indicated that higher temperatures promoted the reten-
tion of arsenic by CaO, which was presumably caused by the forma-
calcium arsenate.
tion
Thermodynamic analysis by Wang and Tomita [55] showed that sta-
ble Ca3(AsO4)2 was generated at relatively low temperatures and
only decomposed above 1450 °C. Experimental results obtained by
Lundholm et al. [72] showed that, while the arsenic volatilization
decreased when calcium was present, it was lower than that pre-
dicted by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, which indicated
transport and/or chemical reaction rate limitations.

such

as

As discussed in Section 2.2, the main chemical speciation of arse-
nic in coal is pyrite, suggesting that the behavior of arsenic has a
close connection with iron. Some researchers have studied the cap-
ture of arsenic by mineral iron [32,55,58,73,74]. An equilibrium ther-
modynamic model suggested by Bool and Helble [58] showed that
the condensed arsenic species in acid (high-Si) fly ash from

bituminous Pittsburgh No. 8 coal consisted mainly of Fe3(AsO4)2,
while in alkali (high-Ca) fly ash from subbituminous Black Thunder
coal it appeared as Ca3(AsO4)2. However, Yudovich and Ketris [32]
suggested that iron-arsenate did not occur due to kinetic limitations,
because iron was likely to be absorbed into a silicate glass. A thermo-
dynamic analysis by Wang and Tomita [55] showed FeAsO4 was gen-
erated and only decomposed above 1000 °C. In the work of Díaz-
Somoano et al. [73], the equilibrium composition considering arse-
nic-iron interactions
stable FeAsO4 existed at
400(cid:1)800 °C. Seames and Wendt [74] studied the concentration of
arsenic and iron in fly ash collected from the electrostatic precipita-
tor (ESP) outlet in a coal-fired power plant. A strong positive rela-
tionship was found between arsenic and iron. In addition, Zhang
et al. [75] conducted As2O3(g) adsorption experiments with different
metal oxides. The results showed that the arsenic adsorption effi-
ciency of Fe2O3 was around 57% and was significantly higher than
for other metal oxides, also revealing that Fe2O3 and As2O3 reacted
to form stable arsenates.

showed that

A correlation between arsenic and other minerals has also been
reported [73,76]. Thermodynamic results from Díaz-Somoano et al.
[73] showed the formation of aluminum arsenate was possible even
at high temperatures (>1400 °C) and sodium and potassium arsen-
ates were stable below 900 °C. Magnesium arsenate was also stable
from 600 °C to 1100 °C. An increase in arsenic volatility was only
observed when silicon was considered in the equilibrium calcula-
tions. Contreras et al. [76] also reported that the presence of silicon
had a positive effect on arsenic volatility.

3.5. Sulfur and chlorine

The content and mode of occurrence of sulfur in coal might be
expected to impact arsenic volatilization. Lu et al. [59] studied arse-
nic volatility along with SO2 release experiments; the results indi-
cated that although arsenic levels were often associated with sulfur
content, especially inorganic sulfur in coal, it was difficult to corre-
late the volatilization behaviors of arsenic and sulfur. Some
researchers have found that the volatilization proportion of arsenic
was reduced in coals with higher sulfur content [77(cid:1)79]. However,
this conclusion is not confirmed by the necessary experimental stud-
ies. Contreras et al. [76] found the volatilization proportion of arsenic
might be higher for coal with high calcium content, because sulfur
was more likely to react with calcium in ash, thus reducing arsenic
capture. In addition, sulfur and arsenic in coal may have competed
with the active sites of CaO. However the opposite conclusions were
drawn about the reaction order of CaO + As2O3(g) and CaO + SO2(g)
[69,71,80,81]. Moreover, some researchers suggest that Cl or Br
could also react with calcium, which could change the final effect of
sulfur on arsenic [82]. To determine the effect of sulfur on arsenic
volatilization, the online release curves of SO2 were compared to the
simultaneous release curve of arsenic (obtained indirectly through
changing the residence time of raw coal in the tube furnace) during
coal combustion in the work of Liu et al. [66]. The simultaneous vola-
tilization characteristics of arsenic and sulfur were observed at both
900 °C and 1300 °C as seen in Fig. 7, demonstrating that arsenic vola-
tilization had a strong correlation with sulfur. Also, these authors
found that coals with higher sulfur content tended to have a larger
proportion of sulfide-bound arsenic, which provided support for the
positive effect of sulfur on arsenic volatilization. More quantitative
conclusions can be expected with the further development of online
arsenic testing technology in the future.

Although the mechanism of decomposition of pyrite during coal
combustion at different temperatures has been reported many times
[83(cid:1)87], the mechanism by which arsenopyrite decomposes has
received relatively little attention [39,88(cid:1)90]. While possible chemi-
cal reactions regarding arsenopyrite decomposition have been simu-
lated using thermodynamic simulation software [55], the specific

reaction temperatures and reaction kinetic constant k value have
not been reported.

In the case of the large Zhundong coal field, which has recently
opened in Xinjiang province in China, the high chloride content of
its coal has raised wide concern [91(cid:1)97]. While chlorine can cause
pipeline corrosion, a greater concern is that it may also combine
with arsenic and generate highly volatile AsCl3 gas. Its volatilization,
and thus the study of the effect of chlorine on arsenic volatilization
are of significant importance to this major project. Using thermody-
namic analysis, Contreras et al. [76] found that for high chlorine con-
centrations AsCl3(g) became the dominant arsenic species at 800 °C,
while for low-chlorine-content fuels, AsO2(g) was the dominant spe-
cies, as shown in Fig. 8. However, this study was limited to a simula-
tion of the impact of chlorine on arsenic release and confirmatory
experiments have not yet been reported.

3.6. Pressure

Pressure affects the flue gas equilibrium composition and may
result in major changes in the proportions of equilibrium species. In
the work of Liu et al. [68], high pressure was shown to lead to the
formation and enhancement of the reduced species and increased
condensation temperature of the volatile elements. The results of
Contreras et al. [76] showed that at 800 °C, the proportion of the gas-
eous arsenic species increased as pressure increased, with a decrease
in AsO2(g) concentration and an increase in As4O10(g), as shown in
Fig. 9.

The effect of pressure on arsenic components during under-
ground coal gasification was modelled by Liu et al. [68]. Results
showed that when pressure increased from 0.12 MPa to 3 MPa, the
percentage of AsH3(g) increased markedly and it became the domi-
nant species below 1250 °C, while AsH(g) was the main gas species
above 1250 °C, indicating that the effect of the reducing atmosphere
was enhanced at higher pressures. Moreover, the percentage of AsS
(g) decreased sharply with increasing pressure, which indicated that
sulfide species were not favoured at high pressures. The calculation
results at 0.12 MPa and 3 MPa are shown in Fig. 10.

Overall, research on the effect of pressure on arsenic volatiliza-
tion is still limited to thermodynamic simulation; and no related
experiments have been reported.

3.7. Oxy-fuel combustion

Oxy-fuel combustion is a process that uses oxygen mixed with
recycled flue gas for coal combustion to deliver a CO2-rich flue gas
for direct sequestration and/or storage [98,99]. CO2 is more easily
captured under oxy-fuel conditions than in conventional air com-
bustion and other air pollutants such as SO2 and NOx are reduced
[100(cid:1)106]. As a consequence, this technology offers near-zero emis-
sion of air pollutants, allowing it to meet stringent emission regula-
tions. The high CO2 partial pressure in an oxy-fuel boiler has been
hypothesized to promote higher CO levels than would be observed
in conventional air-fired boilers [107,108]; if so, this could lead to a
more intensive reducing atmosphere at the surface of carbon par-
ticles, causing oxides to be reduced to unstable sub-oxides. Changes
in gas composition during oxy-fuel combustion involve modification
of the operating conditions of the particle- and gas-cleaning devices
compared to those in conventional air-fired pulverized coal power
plants. Consequently, the physical, mineral, chemical, and leach-
ing properties of residues (slag/bottom ash, fly ash, and flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) gypsum) as well as the fate of trace ele-
from those
ments in oxy-fuel combustion may be different
observed in conventional air-fired power plants [109,110].
In
support of this hypothesis, Wang et al. [111] reported oxy-fuel
combustion increased the concentration of trace elements mea-
sured in particulate matter (PM).

Due to the large difference between oxy- and air-combustion
atmospheres, arsenic volatilization characteristics observed for con-
ventional air combustion may not apply to oxy-fuel combustion. In
fact, arsenic volatility during oxy-fuel combustion is strongly
affected by the elevated concentrations of various gases in the boiler
atmosphere, such as O2, CO2, SO2 and H2O(g).

3.7.1. O2

Wang et al. [111] conducted an oxy-fuel combustion test at 1500 °
C in a high-temperature drop-tube furnace and sampled at 135 °C to
analyze the characteristics of trace elements in the particulates. This
work showed that higher O2 concentrations under oxy-combustion
conditions induced lower trace element concentration in the form of
fine PM. However, the work of Low and Zhang [112] showed that

increased oxygen partial pressure favored the vaporization of arsenic,
due to the increased particle temperature under elevated oxygen
content. O2/CO2 combustion experiments conducted by Liu et al.
[113] with a tube furnace showed that the effect of O2 changed with
temperature. At <900 °C, higher O2 partial pressures led to more
intense coal combustion and a larger volatile proportion of arsenic,
irrespective of CO2 content, while at >900 °C, the effect of O2 was
smaller. It appeared that higher O2 partial pressure promoted arsenic
vaporization and further reduced its concentration in particles.

3.7.2. CO2

In the case of reducing conditions associated with the high con-
centration of CO2 in oxy-fuel combustion, some studies have calcu-
lated the arsenic compounds produced under different excess air

C. Wang et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 1(cid:1)28

trace elements over a temperature range of 127(cid:1)1527 °C with vari-
ous excess air ratios from 0.6 to 1.2. They found that arsenic was eas-
ier to vaporize under a reducing atmosphere since trace elements
were more likely to generate unstable compounds such as volatile
sub-oxides and sulfides. Liu et al. [68] reported that the form of gas-
eous arsenic was mainly AsO(g) in oxidizing atmosphere at relatively
high temperatures, but in reducing atmosphere As(g) became the
primary species above 1450 °C. Liu et al. [113] conducted thermody-
namic analyses to study the equilibrium components of calcium
arsenate (Ca3(AsO4)2) and ferric arsenate (FeAsO4) with O2/C molar
ratio of 1.2 (oxidizing atmosphere) or 0.8 (reducing atmosphere), as
shown in Fig. 11.

Fig.11 indicates that arsenic compounds with high oxidation
states were reduced to compounds with lower oxidation states in a
reducing atmosphere, as expected. For example, FeAsO4 was reduced
to FeAs and FeAs2. However, the arsenic compounds with lower oxi-
dation states had poor thermal stability, and readily decomposed
into secondary oxides or elemental arsenic under high-temperature
conditions [55], leading to the rapid volatilization of arsenic.

Some researchers have also studied the effects of oxy-fuel com-
bustion on arsenic experimentally. Using a typical Chinese bitumi-
nous coal, the experiments of Wang et al. [111] indicated that oxy-
fuel combustion with higher CO2 content increased arsenic concen-
trations in PM as compared to air combustion, as seen in Fig. 12.

Low and Zhang [112] did pyrolysis experiments in N2 and CO2
atmospheres in a lab-scale drop-tube furnace at 1500 °C to study the
effect of CO2 on arsenic behavior. The results are shown in Fig. 13.
The substitution of N2 by CO2 for oxy-fuel combustion caused little
change to the emission and speciation of arsenic at the initial step of
coal combustion and pyrolysis.

Roy et al. [116] simulated the equilibrium composition of arsenic
compounds of three lignites under oxy-fuel combustion atmosphere
using FactSage software. The results showed that at low temperature
the distribution of toxic arsenic species in oxy-fuel combustion was
almost the same as in air combustion. Contreras et al. [117] simu-
lated the arsenic evaporation characteristics for different CO2 con-
centrations under oxy-fuel combustion atmosphere using HSC
Chemistry software [118] and also found arsenic vaporization did
not increase under oxy-firing conditions.

Zhuang and Pavlish [119] studied the behavior of hazardous air
pollutants in a 200-kW oxygen-fired coal combustion power plant
with different flue gas recycling (FGR) systems, as shown in Fig. 14.

In contrast to Wang et al. [111], who found that higher CO2 con-
tent increased arsenic concentrations in PM with diameters in the
micrometer range, Zhuang and Pavlish [119] reported that compared

ratios via thermodynamic equilibrium analysis [68,113(cid:1)115]. Cha-
tain et al. [114] found that under reducing conditions the volatiliza-
tion of arsenic at 800 °C decreased due to the decrease in volatile
oxides concentration. Yan et al. [115] simulated the migration of

Currently, it is difficult to determine whether CO2 has a positive
or negative role in arsenic volatilization under oxy-fuel combustion
and it is clear that further study is needed.

3.7.3. SO2 and H2O(g)

Wang et al. [111] reported the effects of SO2 and H2O on trace
element distribution under oxy-fuel combustion atmosphere at
1500 °C. The results are shown in Fig. 16. SO2 reduced the total
amount and concentration of trace elements in PM under oxy-fuel
combustion, while H2O(g) enhanced both the mass of the PM, and
the trace element mass in the PM. The results indicated that SO2 pro-
moted the volatilization of arsenic during oxy-fuel combustion,
while H2O(g) reduced it.

However, given that only limited information is available on the
effect of SO2 and H2O(g) on arsenic volatilization during oxy-fuel
combustion, more research is needed on this subject.

The coal particles burned in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers
are larger than those in pulverized coal boilers and it is known that
particle size is an important factor during coal combustion since it
affects the ignition, burnout of coals and PM formation, as well as
the volatilization of arsenic. Unfortunately, the effect of particle size
on arsenic volatilization is still largely unstudied.

4. Transformation of arsenic during post-combustion

Volatile arsenic compounds in the flue gas gradually condense as
the temperature decreases. Some volatile arsenic components may
condense on the surface of fly ash, react with substances in fly ash,
or be absorbed by fly ash and captured by the ESP. Only a small
amount of arsenic passes through the FGD system and is finally
emitted to the atmosphere. Once combustion gases are carried
downstream from the combustion zone of a coal-fired boiler, the
key factors affecting the final trace constituent transformation/parti-
tioning behavior are the conversion of vaporized components into
various solid forms and their collection along with the fly ash. Gas-
eous arsenic will experience adsorption, condensation, and chemical
transformation as the flue gas cools [15,120].

4.1. Distribution of arsenic in power plants

with air firing, arsenic showed lower concentrations on fly ash dur-
ing 21% O2/79% CO2 combustion with the recycled flue gas coming
from the ESP outlet or the wet scrubber outlet (Fig. 15), which indi-
cated that oxy-fuel combustion increased the arsenic volatilization.

Fig. 17 shows a typical pulverized coal combustion system and
related equipment. A summary of the data on the distribution of
arsenic in raw coal, ash, and flue gas from such a system is presented
in Table 5.

Many researchers have calculated the mass balance ratio of arse-
nic by measuring the arsenic concentration in solid products,

without considering the gas phase. In the work of Aunela-Tapola
et al. [123], two Finnish coal-fired power plants (SB and HB) were
experimentally investigated with regard to the distribution of arse-
nic. The mass balances of arsenic in two bituminous coals in SB and
HB, were 125% and 113%, respectively. Only 22(cid:1)36% arsenic recov-
ery was obtained by Li et al. [125] when testing three lignites. For a
in two 660 MW boilers with a low-temperature
mixed coal

economizer (LTE), the mass balance of arsenic was only 57.3%
[124]. The relatively low mass balance of arsenic was mainly due
to arsenic in the flue gas and ultrafine particles (<0.2 mm) not
being accounted for. Unlike laboratory experiments, the sampling
process in an industrial system can experience significant devia-

arsenic can condense or be absorbed on interior surfaces of
equipment such as heating surfaces [130].

Only a few researchers have studied the mass balances of arsenic
considering both solid and gaseous arsenic. Clemens et al. [126]
studied Waikato coal under fluidized bed combustion (50-kW capac-
ity). Although this study took the gaseous arsenic into account, it did
not give the specific mass balance figures. The arsenic concentration
in flue gas was 18.4 mg/m3 in the work of Otero-Rey et al. [127],
where 60.2% to 79.1% of arsenic mass balance was obtained. Reddy
et al. [128] researched the emission characteristics of arsenic at a
220-MW power plant equipped with tangential burners burning
three types of coal with arsenic content of 41.9 § 2.4 mg/g. The mass
balance of arsenic in the three coals was in the range of 83.26% to
84.20%. However, the arsenic balance considering all phases was
lower than 100%; one possible reason is that the sampling of arsenic
in flue gas was not done using online sampling techniques. Here, the
sampling method was liquid sampling, using absorption bottles.
During flue gas sampling, the flue gas was cooled continuously as it
passed from the flue into the absorption bottle, which may have
caused some of the arsenic in the flue gas to condense on the pipes.
However, the metal inner wall of the sampling gun could not be acid
washed, which likely resulted in the loss of arsenic in the gas phase.
In general, such problems ensure that the mass balance results for
arsenic considering the gas phase are typically much less than 100%
[127,128].

4.2. Enrichment of arsenic on fine particles

their

during

partitioning

Trace elements can be categorized into three main groups with
regard
combustion
[13,57,131(cid:1)137]. Elements such as As, Cd, Pb, Sb, and Se are in group
II and are found concentrated more on the fine-grained fly ash par-
ticles [31]. Thus, most of the generated arsenic vapor is captured by
fly ash and tends to accumulate on the surface of the smaller fly ash
particles, which here refers to those particles whose aerodynamic
diameter is less than 10 mm [138(cid:1)144].

coal

Querol et al. [145] tested the content and distribution of 23 trace
elements in the fuel (organic and/or inorganic affinities) and in the
combustion wastes (partition and volatility) during combustion in a
large power station. Results showed that arsenic exhibited segrega-
tion in the fly ash (fly ash/slag concentration ratio > 1.5). Likewise,
Liu et al. [146] found that while the arsenic concentration in the feed
coal of a coal-fired power plant in the Yanzhou area of Shandong
was only 2.3 mg/g, arsenic concentration was three times higher in
the fly ash (7.0 mg/g). Zhao et al. [53] reported a bimodal distribution
of arsenic associated with particulates during the combustion of high-
arsenic coals from the Guizhou province of China. When the tempera-
ture increased from 1100 °C to 1400 °C, an emission of arsenic in PM
with diameter less than 1 mm (PM1) increased from 0.07 mg/Nm3 to
0.25 mg/Nm3. Based on the enrichment factor proposed by Ratafia-
Brown [147], Tang et al. [148] tested the enrichment factors of arsenic
in fly ash collected from four hoppers in one of the utility boilers from
the Luohe Power Plant (LH#1), in Anhui Province, China (as shown in
Fig. 18). From electric field 1 to electric field 4, the enrichment factors
of arsenic increased sharply from 0.6 to 4.4, indicating that arsenic
tended to be enriched in smaller particle sizes.

Studies of arsenic partitioning conducted over the past 40 years
have been focused on the enrichment of arsenic in the submicron fly
ash particulate. The findings of these studies are reported in Table 6.

4.2.1. Factors affecting arsenic enrichment

Effect of temperature. Quann et al. [170] studied the size distribu-
tion of fly ash at 1780 °C and 2180 °C. The amount of submicron
aerosol increased markedly from 4% of total fly ash at 1780 °C to 20%
at 2180 °C, showing that increasing temperature enhanced the for-
mation of submicron aerosol particles. Results supported the

hypothesis that the enrichment of the smaller ash particles in more
volatile species such as arsenic was due to a process of vaporization
and re-condensation of mineral constituents. Senior et al. [171]
showed flame temperature had a dramatic impact on the amount of
certain trace elements such as arsenic and selenium in the submi-
cron ash, indicating that these elements vaporized during the com-
bustion process. However, the amount of vaporization was not
sensitive to the coal grind. In the work of Seames and Wendt [74],
size-segregated ash-laden aerosol samples were isokinetically col-
lected to study the correlations between arsenic and major elements
(as functions of particle size); results showed increasing combustion
temperature increased the availability of active sites and the parti-
tioning of arsenic and selenium onto fly ash particles.

Effect of minerals. Senior et al. [172] concluded that the composi-
tion differences among size-segregated coal samples of different
density were mainly due to the density differences between miner-
als, especially pyrite, and the organic portion of the coal. The high-
density fractions were enriched in pyrite or substances associated
with pyrite. According to the experiment results of Senior et al.
[172], arsenic and iron were concentrated in the high-density frac-
tion of 45(cid:1)63-mm particle size cut of Pittsburgh coal. In addition, it
has been reported that the calcium present in fly ash may interact
with arsenic vapor, resulting in the enrichment of arsenic [69].
Chemical associations between arsenic and calcium or iron were
inferred by Seames and Wendt [74] through PM sampling with a
Berner low-pressure impactor in a 17-kW downflow laboratory
combustor. The correlation between arsenic and calcium/iron in ash
particles is shown in Fig. 19 [74], which indicates that both iron and
calcium could provide sites for arsenic association.

Competition of sulfur and arsenic. Seames and Wendt [74] tested
the effects of sulfur on arsenic partitioning in a 17-kW vertical
downflow combustor with 2 kg/h coal premixed with air (stoichio-
metric ratio, SR = 1.2). Doping SO2 with the primary combustion air,
the total arsenic concentration recovered on particles during Ken-
tucky coal
and
3.77(cid:1)7.33 mm in size, pooled together, decreased from a total of
695 mg/m3 (no added SO2) to 78 mg/m3 (with SO2 addition). Fig. 20
shows the transformation of arsenic compounds with sulfur in coal.
Sulfur was thought to compete with these surface reactions of min-
erals and arsenic, which decreased arsenic partitioning onto fly ash
surfaces.

than those of PM0.5(cid:1)1.0 (diameter range 0.5(cid:1)1.0 mm), showing arse-
nic tended to be enriched in fine particles. Particularly, with the LTE

operating, the enrichment factor of arsenic in PM0.2(cid:1)0.5 decreased
sharply from 42 to 32, as shown in Fig. 21. A possible reason is that
with the LTE on, a lower flue gas temperature (100(cid:1)108 °C) was
obtained than with the LTE non-operational (138(cid:1)146 °C), which
significantly reduced the amount of PM at the outlet of the ESP. As a

result, the concentration of arsenic in fine PM was reduced. In addi-
tion, the decreasing enrichment factor order of trace elements
(As > Cd > Cr > Pb > Mn) indicated that trace elements with higher
in the fine particles
volatility had an increased enrichment
[120,173,174].

4.3. Speciation transformation of arsenic

Total concentrations of trace elements in raw coal and ash sam-
ples and their partitioning in coal-fired power stations have been
extensively studied in the last few years, with diverse analytical
methods [175]. Speciation of individual trace elements, however,
requires more specific analytical measurement techniques, which
are significantly different from those applicable to the determination
of total elemental concentration [139,176(cid:1)182]. X-ray absorption
fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy has been widely used to deter-
mine the speciation of trace elements in solid phases [88,183]. In
recent years, XANES and extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) spectroscopy, which are more sensitive to the local struc-
tural environment of an element, have begun to be used in specia-
tion studies of trace elements.

Arsenic XANES and arsenic EXAFS spectra by Zielinski et al. [139]
indicated that most arsenic in the coal was contained in a generation
of arsenic-bearing pyrite (arsenian pyrite (FeS2(cid:1)(cid:1)As), arsenopyrite
(FeAsS), or As substitutes for S in pyrite (Fe(AsxS1-x)2)), while most
(95%) of the arsenic was present as As5+ in fly ash. The majority of
arsenic in a highly alkaline (pH = 12.7) fly ash was present as As5+ in
calcium arsenate (Ca3(AsO4)2). While in a highly acidic (pH = 3.0) fly
ash, arsenic was associated with some combination of iron oxide,
oxyhydroxide, or sulfate. Shah et al. [49] tested the arsenic specia-
tion in feed coal and combustion products. In coal 65% As5+, 25% As3+
and 10% As/pyrite were found, while in the fly ash, 90% of arsenic
was found as the less toxic As5+ and 10% as As3+. The arsenic XANES
spectra of coal and fly ash samples determined by these workers are
shown in Fig. 23. This finding is consistent with the previous studies
that arsenic in fly ash was mainly present as As5+ with lower concen-
trations of As3+ [184(cid:1)186]. This was partly caused by the interaction
of As2O3(g) in the As3+ form with CaO in fly ash, which formed the
stable As5+ compounds [76,81,187(cid:1)189].

Difference between bench- and pilot-scale results. The concentra-
tion of arsenic in submicron particles at the ESP inlet emphasized
the difference between pilot-scale tests and laboratory results, as
shown in Fig. 22 [171]. According to Senior et al. [171], the amount
of ash in the vaporization mode as well as the amounts of several
refractory elements (Ca, Fe, and Co) in the laboratory combustor [56]
were similar to the pilot-scale study [171]. Thus, they concluded
that the flame conditions in the two systems were similar. In this
case, the results of laboratory and pilot-scale tests were compared to
study the transformation of arsenic. In the laboratory sample at
1150 °C, 25% of arsenic was found in the submicron mode, while in
the submicron sample from the pilot-scale combustion facility less
than 5% of arsenic was found. The possible reason is that more chem-
ical condensation took place in the pilot-scale test, which caused
arsenic present in the gas to condense preferentially on larger ash
particles, not on the submicron ash.

Arsenic enrichment in fine ash is affected by many factors. Fur-
ther studies are needed to obtain consistent conclusions on the
effect of each factor, as well as the reactions between arsenic and fly
ash. In addition, the available fly ash surface area for arsenic conden-
sation/adsorption is also required information for the purpose of
predicting the partitioning of arsenic, thereby reducing toxic emis-

In the work of Goodarzi et al. [50], a medium volatile bituminous
coal with an ash content of 34 wt% was combusted in a 150-MW
Canadian power plant. The distribution of arsenic in feed coals, ash,
and stack-emitted materials was determined with XANES spectros-
copy. Results showed, first, that arsenic in the feed coal was domi-
nated by arsenate (54%), followed by arsenical pyrite (FeAsS) (24%)
and an arsenite (As3+(cid:1)O) species (12%) (Fig. 24(a)). It is possible that
the As5+ and As3+ species were derived by oxidation of the arsenical
pyrite [180]. Second, the content of arsenic in bottom ash was quite
low, while a majority of arsenic (>90%) in fly ash was present as As5+
(as shown in Fig. 24(b)). Third, more than 99% of total arsenic was
captured by the particulate removal devices.

In the work of Luo et al. [141], both arsenic K-edge XANES and
EXAFS spectra were collected for the speciation determination in
five fly ash samples. A comparison of arsenic K-edge XANES spectra
of the samples to spectra of oxidation-state standards demonstrated
that arsenic was predominantly As5+ in all samples. Furthermore,
(cid:4)2H2O) [190], calcium arsenate [Ca3(AsO4)2]
mansfieldite (AlAsO4
[191], and calcium pyroarsenate (Ca2As2O7) [192] were considered
as the possible As5+ speciation in fly ash.

An improved graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry
(GFAAS) method, complemented by thermal gravimetric analyzer/
differential scanning calorimeter (TGA/DSC) experiments, was first
used to study trace element partitioning from mineral exclusions by
Raeva et al. [193]. However, this method had limitations for trace
element and inorganic matrix speciation because samples had to be
introduced into the furnace in a homogeneous form. Thus water-
insoluble matrices, e.g., quartz and pyrite, could not be tested.

According to the studies noted above, most of the arsenic in ash
was present as As5+. With regard to the arsenic speciation in flue gas,
Germani and Zoller [194] concluded that the arsenic was mainly
present as As4O6 by measuring the As4O6 and As0 in flue gas. Here,
0.7(cid:1)52% of the total in-stack concentration of arsenic in the vapor
phase was reported as As2O3 by Ratafia-Brown [147].

more extensive fragmentation took place in bituminous coals,
resulting in a narrower size distribution of particles. In addition, the
particle size of coal char showed a greater influence on fragmenta-
tion in bituminous coals [195].

Effect of residence time. It is also possible that some larger mineral
particles may be only partly melted due to the short residence time
in the boiler, forming fly ash particles with non-spherical shapes.
When the load is reduced, the temperature and flue gas flow rate in
the boiler decrease accordingly. As a result, the residence time of
particles is extended. It seems reasonable to expect that with longer
particle residence time, more melting will occur in pulverized coal
boilers. In that case, the vaporization proportion of fly ash aerosols
would increase to some extent and enhance the concentration of
fine particulate matter in the fly ash. In addition, the physical prop-
erties of mineral particles can be expected to affect the particle size
distribution. Mineral particles with relatively high melting points
could leave the pulverized coal boiler without entering the vapor
phase. Moreover, non-volatile species may appear in the vapor
phase due to association with organic material, and some volatile
elements may be trapped within the liquid matrix material [196].

Effect of combustion environment. Combustion environment and
flame temperature have already been shown to affect fine ash for-
mation. A reducing and high-temperature environment caused
evaporation of inorganic matter, including both trace and major ele-
ments from the coal matrix [205]. Also, a CO2-rich environment has
been shown to reduce the fragmentation of carbonate minerals. As
mentioned in Section 4.2, higher char particle temperatures during
the combustion or gasification of coal may cause higher vaporization
of inorganic matter and thus enhanced concentration of fine par-
ticles.

In general, it can be expected that with a higher rate of char frag-
mentation, longer residence time, and higher flame temperature, a
larger proportion of fine particles will be generated, which will
enhance the enrichment of arsenic in fly ash.

4.4. Transformation mechanism

4.4.2. Arsenic partitioning pathway

4.4.1. Fly ash formation and particle size distribution

The transformation behavior of arsenic is closely related to fly ash
formation, particle size distribution, and migration evolution of min-
erals. The fundamental formation mechanism of coal ash is shown in
Fig. 25 [195]. The process was divided into two parts: coal with
included minerals; and coal with excluded minerals. Residual ash
ranging from 1(cid:1)100 mm was formed from excluded minerals or
fusion of
included minerals. Sub-micron ash ranging from
0.01(cid:1)1 mm was formed by vaporization, followed by homogeneous
condensation, heterogeneous condensation, coagulation and aggre-
gation, or extensive fragmentation of minerals. The size distribution
of fly ash particles was thought to be influenced by several factors,
including combustion environment, coal properties, and residence
time.

Effect of coal properties. It has been reported that higher rates of
char fragmentation resulted in smaller fly ash particle size [196].
Tang et al. [197] reported that vitrinite particles (with higher H:C)
produced highly porous char with severe fragmentation during com-
bustion, which in turn, resulted in formation of fine ash. According to
Buhre et al. [198], most of the evaporated water-soluble inorganic
matter (mostly present in low rank coals or black liquor) and organi-
cally-associated inorganic matter contributed to the formation of
PM1. In addition, experiments on the effects of alkalis [199(cid:1)201]
and sulfur [202,203] in raw coals were conducted in drop-tube fur-
nace to study the formation of PM1. Higher alkalis and sulfur content
were expected to improve the amount of PM1, especially particles
under 0.6 mm. Char produced by different types of coal may also
have caused particle size distribution differences [204]. The experi-
ments of Attalla et al. [195] showed that, compared to lignite, much

Senior et al. [206] pointed out that the transformation of arsenic
in coal to ash was actually the process of arsenic migrating into the
different size fractions of ash, namely arsenic partitioning, based on
the formation and deposition of fine particles.

Ratafia-Brown [147] identified five physical/chemical processes
that controlled trace element partitioning and determined their final
physical form, namely: heterogeneous condensation on the existing
fly ash particles and heat exchange surfaces (Pathway 1); homoge-
neous condensation (nucleation) and coalescence as submicron
aerosols if local supersaturating conditions exist (Pathway 2); physi-
cal/chemical adsorption on fly ash particles (Pathway 3); homoge-
neous and heterogeneous chemical reaction among trace elements,
fly ash, and flue gas constituents (Pathway 4); and, remaining in the
vapor phase for species with high vapor pressure at typical boiler
exit temperature (Pathway 5).

All the pathways except Pathway 5 are volatility-dependent, sup-
porting the hypothesis that the volatilization process provides the
critical input for the transformation of arsenic.

4.5. Partitioning model

Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, which consider coal as
a homogenous material, have been widely used to predict the trans-
formation of arsenic compounds in coal [72,76,207(cid:1)210]. Although
various factors have been considered, such as temperature, pressure,
atmosphere, and other interactions, the calculation results are ther-
modynamic ones; they do not account for the reaction kinetics and
heterogeneous nature of coal [76]. In the early 1990s, Linak and
Wendt [211,212] began to place emphasis on prediction of the size-
segregated distribution of trace metals in power plants. It was found

that the partitioning of trace elements on sized fly ash was con-
trolled by fuel composition and combustion conditions. Subse-
the nucleation, film condensation, and coagulation
quently,
processes that govern the particle size distribution of multiple toxic
metals in practical combustion environments were experimentally
and theoretically explored by Davis et al. [213]. The size-fractionated
fine particles were shown to be in good agreement with aerosol
dynamics theory. Helble [169] developed a model of trace element
emissions with the input data of fundamental laboratory results on
trace element partitioning. The model indicated that with element
incorporation and size-dependent partitioning and penetration, the
predicted arsenic concentration in flue gas could be improved by
more than 25%. Subsequently, Senior el al. [61] developed a one-
dimensional model to predict the behavior of arsenic in the post-
combustion region as a function of gas residence time. Heteroge-
neous condensation and surface reaction of arsenic on fly ash as well
as the effect of SO2 on arsenic partitioning were considered in the
model. The model assumed that the particle size distribution of fly
ash did not change with temperature and time. More recently, James
et al. [214] developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model
Previously developed mathematical
of
approaches, combined with pyritic mineral transformation mecha-
nisms, excluding fragmentation, and recently determined experi-
mental speciation details, were employed to predict trace element
partitioning and spatial evolution during combustion. However,
they only considered the particle size distribution of fly ash, and not
the interaction and impact of arsenic and other elements. In future,

arsenic partitioning.

more effort is required to develop a model of arsenic partitioning in
which the particle size distribution of fly ash with gas residence
time, the heterogenous/homogeneous condensation of arsenic, and
the reactions between arsenic and other species could all be
included.

Zeng et al. [215] established the first quantitative physicochemi-
cal model for vaporization of arsenic during coal pyrolysis and com-
bustion. The vaporization process for arsenic consists of three
consecutive processes: transport of molecules or atoms through the
bulk pyrite liquid (melt) to the melt/gas interface, vaporization of
arsenic on the surface of melts, and transport of molecules/atoms
through the pores of the char to the atmosphere. The controlling
step is diffusion through the melt. Raeva et al. [216] presented a new
method for the direct measurement of kinetic parameters under
conditions that simulated the vaporization of inorganic material
during coal combustion. This method was used to generate key
physical property data which were necessary for modeling and
assessment of the vaporization behavior of trace elements.

However, the model of arsenic volatilization is far from well-
developed and trace elements may be in the form of organically-
associated material (incorporated into the organic structure of the
coal), inclusions, or exclusions [217,218]. The volatilization charac-
teristics of arsenic in various forms are significantly different. For
example, arsenic in the exclusion form is easily released into the
atmosphere with the combustion of coal, while arsenic which is
organically associated with coal is must be released by devolatiliza-
tion, particle fragmentation, char combustion, and burnout. Because

18

C. Wang et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 1(cid:1)28

char simultaneously reacts with the oxygen in the surrounding envi-
ronment, vaporization of arsenic that is organically associated with
coal may occur mainly in a reducing atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 25
(represented by dotted line circles). That is to say, arsenic in different
forms shows different volatilization characteristics along with the
combustion of coal particles. However, the current models of arsenic
volatilization do not separate organic-,
inclusive-, and exclusive-
related arsenic forms. These models typically assume a uniform dis-
persion of inclusive-related material within the char particle [219].
One reason for this is that it is not physically possible to utilize real
coal particles to generate data for these three forms separately. In
addition, the model results for volatilization of arsenic under micro-
environmental conditions cannot be confirmed in actual furnace com-
bustion experiments. The arsenic volatilization model requires further
improvement to establish the partitioning behavior of arsenic.

5. Emission of arsenic in coal-fired power plants

5.1. Collaborative control of arsenic by ESP and FGD equipment

partitioned into the solid by-product (gypsum) and water stream (e.
g., gypsum slurry) after passing through flue gas desulfurization sys-
tems [221]. Particulate-bound metals can be captured by particulate
control facilities such as ESPs and fabric filters. Fly ash captured by
ESP is used as a raw material for the synthesis of construction mate-
rial such as cement and concrete because of its pozzolanic properties
[222]. However, the fact that arsenic is largely enriched in fly ash
should not be ignored. In addition, under more restrictive environ-
mental regulations, most coal power stations are equipped with FGD
systems, which could control acid gas emissions and also effectively
control gaseous and particulate arsenic emissions [123]. FGD gyp-
sum with arsenic can be used in wallboard manufacture, or for some
applications as a lime substitute [223]. FGD gypsum is also employed
as a landfill material in mine reclamation [224]. Some fly ash and
FGD gypsum end up in landfills. Although FGD gypsum is regarded
as environmentally friendly at present, it could become an issue
with increasing landfill closures if further uses are not found for it
[70]. Because of the wide use of fly ash and FGD gypsum, as well as
the fact that they may be arsenic carriers, a better understanding is
needed of the effects of APCDs on arsenic emissions.

The application of air pollution control devices (APCDs) in power
plants can significantly affect the redistribution of arsenic in com-
bustion by-products and alter the route by which the elements reach
the environment [220]. A certain proportion of trace elements can be

5.1.1. Effect of ESPs

The enrichment of arsenic on fine fly ash has been summarized in
Section 4.2. However, researchers have reached varying conclusions

on gaseous arsenic removal efficiency using ESPs. For example, the
study of Cheng et al. [156] on the partitioning of several trace ele-
ments in a full-scale coal combustion process in China showed that
the removal efficiency of arsenic by an ESP unit was as high as 97%.
But, according to Tang et al. [70], the average removal efficiency for
arsenic was 83%, based on an investigation of two pulverized coal-
fired power plants in China that burned bituminous coal. An ESP
removes trace elements present in the form of PM, but removal effi-
ciencies depend on the efficiency of the ESP and the mineral content
of the fly ash.

In recent years, a new dust control technology called electro-
static-fabric-integrated precipitator (EFIP) has become increasingly
common. This technology combines the advantages of ESP and the
bag filler, and is believed to be a low-cost, promising, high-efficiency
method for fine particle removal. Wang et al. [225] carried out a full-
scale field investigation on trace element emission at a power plant
equipped with EFIP. The study of field sampling results showed that
the arsenic concentration contained in electrostatic precipitation
ash was larger than that in the fabric filtration ash. Also, the arsenic
contained in fabric filtration ash tended to release into the environ-
ment more easily.

5.1.2. Effect of FGD

Trace elements in the FGD system come mainly from limestone,
flue gas, and PM, as well as the slurry water. C(cid:1)ordoba et al. [158]
studied the abatement capacity of trace elements (including arsenic)
in a large pulverized coal combustion power station equipped with a
wet limestone flue gas desulfurization unit (WFGD), concluding that
the control rate of arsenic (moderately volatile element) was more
(cid:1)
than 92% [158]. Similarly,
Alvarez-Ayuso et al. [224,226] conducted
sampling experiments in a coal-fired power plant, which consisted
of feed coal, boiler slag, fly ash, limestone, FGD gypsum, process
water, and waste water. Data analysis showed that arsenic entering
the FGD system was mainly in the gaseous form, which was not
consistent with the view of C(cid:1)ordoba et al. [158]. A possible rea-
son is that the arsenic content of the limestone feed was rela-
tively high in the experiment of C(cid:1)ordoba et al., while arsenic
(cid:1)
content of the limestone was 1 mg/kg in the work of
Alvarez-
Ayuso et al. [224].

WFGD is considered to have high collection efficiency for gaseous
arsenic. C(cid:1)ordoba et al. [158] considered that a large part of the arse-
nic (90%) was absorbed by the gypsum slurry, while the arsenic dis-
charged from the WFGD system was in the form of PM (6.6%) and a
small portion of arsenic-bearing species was emitted in gaseous
(cid:1)
form.
Alvarez-Ayuso et al. [224] also concluded that WFGD systems
had a high trapping ability for arsenic with 96% to 100% of the gas-
eous arsenic trapped by the WFGD system. Meij [120] found a trap-
ping ability of 75%. Using on-site sampling data, Tang et al. [70]
calculated a trapping ability of only 61% and suggested that there
was no relationship between operating conditions and removal
capacity of gaseous arsenic. In FGD systems, trapped arsenic most

likely combined to form calcium(cid:1)(cid:1)arsenate. Tang et al. [70] further
suggested the specific binding form was Ca3(AsO4)2.

5.2. Total emission of arsenic in power plants

Based on arsenic content in feed coals, combustion products, and
desulfurization products collected in field tests, researchers have
predicted the overall arsenic emissions from power plants [70,159].
Tang et al. [70] investigated the distribution of arsenic (including
feed coal and its combustion products) in two 600-MW Chinese
coal-fired power plants (the Luohe Power Plant and Pingwei Power
Plant). Both were equipped with ESP and FGD systems and fed with
pulverized bituminous coal from the Huainan coalfields. The bottom
ash, fly ash, feed coal, limestone, FGD gypsum, and process water
were collected simultaneously to calculate the total emission and
stack emission proportion of arsenic. The results showed that the
average removal efficiencies of arsenic by the ESP and FGD units
were 83% and 61%, respectively. The average stack emission ratio of
arsenic was 6% and the total annual emissions of arsenic from the
two plants were estimated at 0.46 t [70]. Quispe et al. [159] studied
the changes in mobility of arsenic in coal during combustion at a
power plant in Santa Catarina, Brazil. The power plant, equipped
with ESP, generated 857 MW/h of electricity with a consumption of
200,000 tons of coal per month. Considering only the easily soluble
fraction, they believed that coal ash could trap 1.7 t of arsenic annu-
ally. Furthermore, by taking the mobile metal fraction of the com-
bustion ash into consideration, they estimated that the amount of
arsenic which would affect the surrounding environment was 19 t
per year [159].

The differing boiler capacity, feed coals, and pollution control
devices among power stations can lead to large differences in the
emission data of arsenic. An overall emission factor for arsenic into
the atmosphere was proposed by Kang et al. [54], as shown in
Table 7.

Ash disposal, like direct emissions of gaseous arsenic, can cause
harm to the environment. When large amounts of fly ash were
stored temporarily in stockpiles, or disposed of in ash landfills or
lagoons [232], harmful elements in the fly ash migrated or leached
into the surrounding soil and groundwater due to the effects of acid
rain [233]. Bata et al. [234] reported that arsenic was more easily
leachable than the other heavy metals in fly ash. However, Otero-
Rey et al. [235] concluded that leachable arsenic was less than 20%
of total arsenic in fly ash. Effective controls on toxic elements such
as arsenic are, therefore, recommended before fly ash, gypsum, etc.,
are used as building materials.

5.2.1. Emission of arsenic in China

Tian et al. [236] studied the atmospheric emissions of arsenic in
China from 2002 to 2010 by combining the detailed coal consump-
tion data, element content in coal, and the specific emission factors
which were classified by different boiler patterns and APCD

configurations. The emission of arsenic from coal-fired power plants
in China is shown in Fig. 26.

As seen in Fig. 26, the atmospheric emissions of arsenic from coal
combustion in China increased from 354.01 t in 2000 (based on
545.9 Mt coal used) to 615.70 t in 2006 (based on 1527 Mt coal
used), and then decreased gradually to 335.45 t in 2010 (based on
1591.0 Mt coal use). This decline can be mainly attributed to the
installation of APCD systems. With advanced high-efficiency-con-
trol-technology and specialized mercury-control technology, the
total amount of arsenic emitted in China was expected to decline to
215.57 t in 2020 [236].

6. Arsenic removal technologies

Power plants face enormous challenges in respect of arsenic
emission control [71]. The existing particulate control devices, such
as ESP and fabric filters, are not very efficient in controlling emis-
sions of arsenic attached to submicron PM, let alone the arsenic in
the vapor phase. Several control options are discussed below.

6.1. Removal of arsenic by calcium-based sorbents

Because of their availability and low cost, calcium-based sorbents
are widely used for SO2 and CO2 capture and many researchers have
explored the adsorption properties of calcium-based sorbents,
mainly CaO, Ca(OH)2, 2CaO(cid:4)SiO2, and CaO(cid:4)SiO2 for gaseous arsenic
retention [71,80,81,237,238]. Due to differences in the specific sur-
face area of calcium-based materials, reported concentrations of gas-
eous arsenic and adsorption time vary considerably among different
studies and specific values of adsorption experiments (adsorption
efficiency, amount of arsenic captured, etc.) are difficult to compare.
Therefore, only adsorption trends are considered here.

6.1.1. Effect of temperature

Temperature is an important parameter in evaluating arsenic
adsorption properties of sorbents. Currently, the focus is on the
medium- and high-temperature range (400(cid:1)1000 °C) under an oxi-
dizing atmosphere. However, there is still no unanimous conclusion
about the impact of temperature and the resulting adsorption prod-
uct at different temperatures.

Some researchers have suggested that for calcium-based adsorb-
ents temperature has a positive effect on arsenic adsorption
[69,80,237]. At 400(cid:1)1000 °C, Mahuli et al. [237] found that tempera-
ture could facilitate arsenic adsorption despite the surface sintering
caused by the elevated temperature. Their research indicated that
the adsorption efficiency of a low-surface-area sorbent in high tem-
peratures could exceed that of a sorbent with high surface area func-
tioning at relatively low temperatures. Researchers from Tsinghua

University carried out experiments on arsenic adsorption over CaO
at 400(cid:1)1000 °C [80]. Their conclusions were similar; however, the
focus of their studies was on the initial reaction rate of CaO and
As2O3. The experimental results of Sterling and Helbe [69] also indi-
cated that increased temperature could promote arsenic adsorption
over CaO. Chemical adsorption is believed to be the main process
between gaseous arsenic and calcium-based adsorbent in the
medium- to high-temperature interval. To verify the adsorption
type, Mahuli et al. [237] placed the post-sorption samples under
nitrogen atmosphere at 800 °C and 1000 °C for desorption. They
found that arsenic content in the samples was almost the same
before and after desorption. This effectively irreversible capture
reaction indicated that chemical adsorption was dominant in the
process. With respect to the adsorption product, the above research-
ers have suggested that the post-sorption sample of calcium-based
adsorbent was Ca3(AsO4)2 (or Ca3As2O8).

Other researchers have suggested that increased temperature
enhanced the arsenic adsorption ability of calcium-based adsorbent
within a certain temperature range. However, adsorption capacity
decreased if the temperature exceeded a certain critical value. Jad-
hav et al. [71] studied the adsorption properties of gaseous arsenic
over CaO at 300(cid:1)900 °C. The results showed that as the temperature
increased, the adsorption capacity increased between 300 °C and
600 °C and then decreased. Related research from Chen et al. [81]
presented similar results, and showed that temperature had positive
effects on the arsenic adsorption capacity of CaO from 300(cid:1)500 °C,
but negative effects from 500(cid:1)1050 °C. However, the findings of
both groups present some problems in terms of distinguishing post-
sorption samples. Jadhav et al. [71] have suggested that the reaction
product of calcium oxide with arsenic was Ca3As2O8 at 300(cid:1)600 °C
and Ca2As2O7 at 700(cid:1)900 °C. Ca2As2O7 has thermal
instability,
which is the main reason that arsenic adsorption capacity decreased
at higher temperatures. The reaction equations are as follows [71]:

In the view of Chen et al. [81], the reaction product of CaO with
arsenic was Ca3(AsO4)2 at all temperatures and the main reason that

21

the adsorption capacity of CaO on arsenic decreased from 500 °C to
1050 °C was because Ca3(AsO4)2 generated under different tempera-
tures had different crystal phases. Compared with the low-tempera-
ture range,
the adsorption product Ca3(AsO4)2 in the high-
temperature range was less thermally stable, and the decomposition
of Ca3(AsO4)2 at 500(cid:1)1050 °C led to the reduced adsorption capacity
of CaO. In the recent work of Zhang et al. [75], the conclusions of
Chen et al. [81] were partially validated. Furthermore, through ther-
modynamic simulation, Zhang et al. [75] found that the adsorption
process (described as Eq. (2)) was an exothermic reaction which
could explain the temperature impact on arsenic.

The adsorption procedures for arsenic in a majority of these
experiments were similar, where solid As2O3 was adopted as the
arsenic source while the adsorption experiments were carried out in
a secondary fixed bed reactor. However, the experimental results
were not identical. There are many reasons for this, the most impor-
tant of which probably lies in the extremely low arsenic concentra-
tions used in these experiments. In addition, online detection of gas-
phase arsenic is not possible at present and experimental error eas-
ily occurs during off-line detection. What should be noted is that all
researchers mentioned here believe chemical adsorption is the dom-
inant process in the medium- to high-temperature interval in oxidiz-
ing conditions, which is an important characteristic of arsenic
adsorption over calcium-based sorbents.

6.1.2. Effect of SO2

Some researchers have explored the effect of SO2 on the arsenic
adsorption process of calcium-based sorbents. However, there is no
agreement on SO2 impact to date. Li et al. [80] made an exhaustive
study of simultaneous adsorption of SO2 and As2O3 vapor and
showed that SO2 did not have a significant impact on arsenic adsorp-
tion. Two main factors could explain this. First, the reaction rate con-
stant of CaO with gaseous arsenic is greater than that of the
desulfurization reaction, which means SO2 does not compete with
As2O3 active sites on the surface of CaO at the initial stage of the
reaction. Second, they demonstrated that calcium sulfate also has
the ability to adsorb gaseous arsenic. Therefore, even if the CaO sur-
face was completely sulfated, it would still show some gaseous arse-
nic adsorption capacity.

Chen et al. [81] recently investigated the effect of SO2 on the arse-
nic adsorption process of calcium-based sorbent over a wide tem-
perature range (300(cid:1)1050 °C). The results showed that SO2 could
partially inhibit the arsenic adsorption process at 300(cid:1)800 °C and at
800 °C the adsorption suppression was the most pronounced. How-
ever, as temperature increased further, the inhibitory effect of SO2
weakened. At 1050 °C a promotional effect of SO2 on arsenic adsorp-
tion was observed. They attributed that to SO2 competing with gas-
eous As2O3 for adsorption sites and the sulfation product CaSO4
occupying the active sites, weakening arsenic adsorption. The sulfa-
tion product may be expected to further block surface pore structure
of the sorbent resulting in surface area decrease, which would fur-
ther restrict arsenic adsorption by CaO. As to the promotional effect
of SO2 in the high-temperature range, they agreed with Li et al. [80]
that CaSO4 also had arsenic adsorption capacity.

The common conclusion is that CaSO4 arsenic adsorption capac-
ity must be considered. However, there is no unified conclusion
about the SO2 impact and further studies are needed.

6.1.3. Kinetic studies

To better understand the arsenic adsorption process of calcium-
based sorbents, researchers have carried out kinetic studies. In 1997,
a kinetic equation describing the reaction between CaO and As2O3
was put forward by Mahuli et al. [237]. The reaction can be described
as:

dx
dt

1⁄4 (cid:1)ksCm

g An

CaO

ð5Þ

where x is the overall conversion ratio of CaO; Cg is the concentration
of the gaseous As2O3; m is the reaction order with respect to the gas-
eous species; n is the reaction order based on sorbent surface area;
ACaO is the specific surface area of the sorbent; ks is the reaction rate
constant; and t is the reaction time. They assumed n = 1 and used the
equation ACaO = S0(1-x) to describe sorbent surface area. Thus, the
above equation could be described as follows:

ln

1
1(cid:1)x

1⁄4 ksCm

g S0t

ð6Þ

By taking the natural logarithm of both sides of Eq. (6) and
obtaining the relationship between ln(-ln(1 ¡ x)) and lnCg, m (cid:5) 1
was calculated. In this case, the assumption of n (cid:5) 1 was verified.
The apparent activation energy of the adsorption reaction was
43.9 kJ/mol. However, there were no specifics concerning frequency
factor.

Other researchers have carried out kinetic studies of the reaction
between CaO and As2O3 based on the research of Mahuli et al. [237]
These results are summarized in Table 8.

Jadhav et al. [71] proposed a novel shrinking core mechanism
model to describe the reaction between CaO and As2O3. In this
model, the specific surface area and pore size were 3.2 m2/g and
near 0 cm3/g, respectively, which were assumed to be low enough to
ensure negligible mass transfer resistance. The conversion ratio of
CaO can be expressed as follows:
Þð1=rpÞt 1⁄4 1(cid:1)ð1(cid:1)xÞ1=3

ð7Þ

ð3kCn
g

=rm

where x is the overall conversion ratio of CaO; rp is particle radius of
CaO; rm is the density of CaO; k is the reaction rate constant; Cg is
the concentration of the gaseous arsenic; t is the reaction time; and
n is the order of Eq. (7). To eliminate the mass transfer resistance, a
higher gas velocity ((cid:5)0.4 m/s) and smaller solid sorbent particles
(<2 mm) were used in the adsorption experiments. Jadhav et al. [71]
studied the effect of gaseous arsenic concentration as well as adsorp-
tion temperature on CaO conversion rates. By combining the Arrhe-
nius equation with Eq. 7, they obtained activation energy of 21.34 kJ/
mol and the order of reaction with respect to arsenic concentration
(n) was close to 1. They suggested that such low activation energy
indicated the reaction had a slow temperature response. It is note-
worthy that the reaction time was controlled in less than 10 min in
these experiments, which eliminated the effect of diffusion of ionic
species (Ca2+ and O2¡) through the product layer. Thus, the

Subsequently, Zhang et al. [239] developed an iron-based sorbent
Fe2O3/g-Al2O3 for gas-phase arsenic capture, on the basis of their
preliminary study. They identified the optimum operating tempera-
ture as being around 600 °C, by carrying out adsorption experiments
at 150(cid:1)900 °C. SO2 was considered to have a promotional effect on
arsenic adsorption, whereas, NO was believed to have little impact.
They suggested that SO2 would be oxidized by Fe3+ on the sorbent
¡, which could facilitate the oxi-
surface, generating SO4
dation of As3+ to As5+. And then, As5+ reacted with Fe2O3, which was
the active ingredient of the sorbent, forming FeAsO4.

2¡ and HSO4

The catalytic oxidation effect of iron-based sorbents may play a
significant role in the adsorption process. However, an accurate
description of the valence changes of the iron ions as well as the
reaction mechanism for the lattice oxygen are lacking in the avail-
able literature.

In addition, Rupp et al. [240] proved that the Pd/g-Al2O3 had the
ability to remove AsH3 from a simulated fuel gas under laboratory
conditions. With a sorbent bed containing ten pounds of Pd/g-Al2O3
held at 260 °C, nearly 100% of selenium, arsenic and mercury within
a dirty fuel gas slipstream were removed. The results indicated that
arsine, phosphine and hydrogen selenide competed against each
other for sorption sites. However, the performance of Pd/g-Al2O3 on
As2O3(g) removal is still unclear.

6.3. Removal of arsenic by fly ash sorbents

A significant proportion of the gaseous arsenic in flue gas
migrates into fly ash due to a condensation or reaction process dur-
ing coal combustion [241]. This means that fly ash could be used as
sorbent material for trace element removal. To explore the adsorp-
tion capacity of fly ash on arsenic, L(cid:1)opez-Ant(cid:1)on et al. [187] carried
out a series of adsorption experiments in a fixed-bed reactor. Two
fly ash samples were selected as sorbents. One sample was taken
from a fluidized bed combustion plant burning a mixture of coal
wastes and the other was taken from a pulverized coal power plant
burning high-rank coals. Adsorption experiments at 120 °C showed
that maximum retention capacity of fly ash for gaseous arsenic was
5.3 mg/g and the corresponding maximum adsorption efficiency was
less than 20%. Díaz-Somoano et al. [73] estimated that calcium and
iron in fly ash played a key role in arsenic adsorption by measuring
the content of calcium, iron and arsenic.

Díaz-Somoano et al. [73] investigated gaseous arsenic adsorption
by fly ash at 120 °C, a relatively low temperature. This was because
high temperatures may cause re-carbonization of the unburned car-
bon in fly ash, resulting in changes to fly ash sorbents. In addition,
while 120 °C was close to the temperature at the inlet of ESP, which
was convenient for fly ash sorbent injection, gaseous arsenic was
prone to condense on the tube wall at 120 °C, increasing the likeli-
hood that such laboratory-scale adsorption experiments would pro-
duce significant errors.

6.4. Removal of arsenic by carbon-based sorbents

As early as 1979, Wouterlood and Bowling [242] explored the
possibility of using activated carbon in gaseous arsenic removal.
They found that the selected activated carbons could adsorb 25% to
45% of arsenic at 200 °C when the concentration of arsenic was
14.64(cid:1)20.24 mg/L. The breakthrough time was more than 10 h
(10.75(cid:1)17.5 h). Comparing the adsorption performance of four kinds
of activated carbon, it was found that the adsorption of arsenic
increased with the specific surface area of the sorbent, however not
in a linear fashion. They also found that As4O6 could be efficiently
desorbed by heating the adsorbent in a non-oxidizing gas. Even after
many adsorption(cid:1)desorption reaction cycles, the arsenic adsorption
performance did not change appreciably (14 cycles).

temperatures [75]. Reproduced with permission from American Chemical Society.

activation energy they calculated was lower than that of Mahuli
et al. [237].

Kinetic study of the adsorption reaction depends on experimental
data and the kinetic model. Kinetic parameters could be signficantly
different because different kinetic equations were adopted and dif-
ferent experimental parameters were applied. However, the reaction
order with respect to arsenic concentration is close to 1, which
appears to be a common conclusion [69,71,75,80,237].

6.2. Removal of arsenic by metal oxide sorbents

In order to explore more efficient arsenic sorbents, Zhang et al.
[75] studied gaseous arsenic adsorption on three metal oxides
(Fe2O3, CaO, and Al2O3). In Fig. 27 experimental data at 600(cid:1)900 °C
show that Fe2O3 had a greater adsorption capacity under the same
experimental conditions.

Adsorption capacity of sorbents increased in the following
order: Al2O3 < CaO < Fe2O3 at 600(cid:1)900 °C. Compared with CaO
and Fe2O3, Al2O3 had a larger specific surface area. But adsorp-
tion capacity of Al2O3 was the lowest. What is more, the thermal
desorption experiment of post-sorption samples showed that lit-
tle arsenic loss was observed in CaO and Fe2O3. However, the
arsenic content in the post-sorption sample of Al2O3 was only
2.21% of the original content. Zhang et al. [75] inferred from this
that physical adsorption was the main process of arsenic adsorp-
tion on Al2O3. Their XRD results also confirmed this conclusion,
showing As2O3 was detected on the Al2O3 surface. They calcu-
lated and compared kinetic parameters of CaO and Fe2O3 for
arsenic adsorption, as shown in Table 9.

Similarly to the work of Jadhav et al. [71], Zhang et al. [75] sug-
gested that the adsorption process was slow in response to tempera-
ture change by comparing the kinetic parameters of CaO and Fe2O3.
They proposed that the frequency factor could describe active site
quantities on the sorbent surface, in which adsorption would take
place.

Subsequently, L(cid:1)opez-Ant(cid:1)on et al. [238] conducted arsenic adsorp-
tion experiments over activated carbon at 250 °C in an arsenic con-
centration of 0.4 mg/mL. They found the behavior of activated
carbons in arsenic retention did not appear to be dependent on the
porous texture of activated carbon, by comparing the adsorption
performance of different pore structures of activated carbon. The
metal elements in the activated carbon, such as calcium and iron,
played a catalytic role in arsenic adsorption. Although sulfur in acti-
vated carbon will affect the adsorption of mercury, they suggested
that the sulfur content in the activated carbon would not cause any
impact on arsenic adsorption.

In summary, there are three main reasons for arsenic adsorption
by activated carbon. First, the large specific surface area and abun-
dant pore structure of activated carbon increases the possibility of
physical adsorption of arsenic. Second, the metallic elements in acti-
vated carbon, such as calcium and iron, can play a catalytic role dur-
ing arsenic adsorption. Third, modified commercial activated
carbons may contain some haloid elements, which could facilitate
arsenic adsorption. However, the raw materials and preparation pro-
cesses for producing activated carbon are vastly different, which
often leads to different and even diametrically opposite conclusions
[238,242]. In general, the research on arsenic adsorption over acti-
vated carbon is still inconclusive.

6.5. Arsenic adsorption in oxy-fuel combustion flue gas

Due to the gas recirculation and the absence of nitrogen, the SO2
concentration in the flue gas of oxy-fuel combustion is much higher
than in air combustion. In addition, the H2O vapor concentration in
oxy-fuel combustion is particularly high. When the same kind of coal
is burned, it is reported that the water vapor concentrations in air
combustion and oxy-fuel combustion are 10% and 31%, respectively
[243]. Wang et al. [244] explored the arsenic adsorption characteris-
tics of iron-based sorbent in oxy-fuel combustion flue gas and pro-
posed that the adsorption mechanism followed the Mars(cid:1)Maessen
mechanism [245]. In oxy-fuel combustion conditions, the high con-
centration of CO2 had a significant adverse effect on arsenic adsorp-
tion. However, the presence of O2 as well as H2O(g) promoted
arsenic removal in the CO2-enriched atmosphere. The increased SO2
concentration was proved to accelerate the adsorption process with
2¡), while with the increase
generation of active species (HSO4
of SO2 concentration in flue gas, the competition between SO2 and
arsenic on iron-based sorbents adsorption was strengthened.

7. Conclusions

Coal combustion is one of the main anthropogenic sources of
arsenic pollution in the environment. Due to its high toxicity, volatil-
ity, and potentially carcinogenic properties, this element is receiving
increasing attention. This paper summarized the properties of arse-
nic in coal, the factors affecting arsenic volatilization during coal
combustion, the transformation behavior, mechanism and model of
arsenic in post-combustion processing, and the emission and
removal technologies of arsenic in power plants.

Temperature has a positive effect on both the volatilization rate
and the degree of volatilization, and temperature-staged volatiliza-
tion characteristics of arsenic. Differences in the mode of occurrence
of arsenic in coals could result in different volatilization proportions
of arsenic even at the same temperature. It is generally accepted
that exchangeable and organic-bound arsenic are easily vaporized at
the devolatilization stage of coal, while arsenic bound to iron-
(cid:1)(cid:1)manganese oxides and pyrite is unstable and tends to vaporize
below 1000 °C. By contrast, arsenates are very stable and usually
decompose at relatively high temperatures. This indicates that coals
with a large proportion of unstable arsenic compounds will have a
higher degree of volatilization. As far as coal rank is concerned, no

obvious correlation between arsenic volatility and coal rank has
been found. In addition, while they have rarely been reported, the
effects of heating rate and particle size on arsenic volatilization
should be taken into consideration. Calcium,
iron, magnesium,
sodium and potassium tend to react with arsenic to form stable
arsenates, which inhibit the volatilization of arsenic, while alumi-
num and silicon may have a positive effect on the volatilization
behavior of arsenic. However, the related reactions and substances
were based on thermodynamic analysis without considering the
chemical kinetics. Simultaneous release of sulfur and arsenic were
found in isothermal coal combustion, demonstrating that arsenic
was closely related to sulfur in coal. The role of chlorine was also
examined. Simulation results show that higher chlorine content in
coal may promote the generation of more volatile compounds like
AsCl3(g), which in turn increase the volatilization ratio of arsenic.

Oxy-fuel combustion is a promising and advanced technology for
carbon capture. Few reports discussed the effect of CO2 on arsenic
volatilization during oxy-fuel combustion, and firm conclusions can-
not be drawn. On one hand, higher CO2 content helps to generate a
reducing atmosphere in the char particle neighborhood, which could
reduce arsenic oxides to more volatile sub-oxides and make the vol-
atilization of arsenic easier. On the other hand, higher CO2 content
inhibits mass and heat transfer, which may decrease the flame tem-
perature and in turn have a negative effect on arsenic volatility. To
date very few experiments have been carried out on the effect of SO2
and H2O(g) on arsenic volatility under oxy-fuel conditions.

When flue gas cools in the post combustion process, vaporized
arsenic species gradually transform to solid-phase and redistribute
in bottom ash, fly ash and flue gas. The mass balance of arsenic from
most studies is less than 100%, mainly due to the condensation or
absorption of arsenic on the interior surfaces of equipment in power
plants. With the application of XANES and EXAFS spectroscopy, the
speciation of arsenic in feed coal and combustion products was stud-
ied. The general view is that arsenic in fly ash is mainly present in
the less toxic As5+ form, while the speciation of arsenic in flue gas
needs to be further examined. In addition, it is widely reported that
most arsenic is captured by fly ash, especially ultrafine ash particles.
With higher rates of char fragmentation, longer residence times and
higher flame temperatures, more fine particles are expected to be
generated, which in turn may enhance the enrichment of arsenic in
fly ash. The enrichment of arsenic on fine particles is also affected by
the sulfur content and mineral composition in the coal, and the way
the combustion system is operated. Based on the close relationship
between arsenic and ash particle formation, several arsenic parti-
tioning models considering the particle size distribution of fly ash
have been developed.

The application of APCDs can significantly affect the redistribu-
tion of arsenic in combustion by-products and alter the route by
which the elements reach the environment. ESPs remove trace ele-
ments present in the form of PM, but not gaseous trace elements.
FGD is believed to have high collection efficiency for gaseous arsenic.
However, the arsenic discharged from WFGD systems is mostly in
the form of PM and a small portion of arsenic-bearing species is
emitted in the gaseous form.

Researchers have explored the adsorption properties of calcium-
based adsorbent, metal oxides, activated carbon and fly ash for gas-
eous arsenic. Calcium-based sorbents have been widely investigated
due to their low cost and ready availability. The adsorption processes
of these sorbents are believed to be a combination of chemical and
physical adsorption. The temperature effect on arsenic removal is
complicated and there is no generally supported conclusion.
Research suggests that CaSO4 has significant arsenic adsorption
capacity and kinetic studies show that the activation energy of the
reaction between CaO and As2O3 lies between 20(cid:1)30 kJ/mol. Most
researchers have suggested that the overall reaction order is 1, while
values of 0.86 and 1.1 were found in two studies.
