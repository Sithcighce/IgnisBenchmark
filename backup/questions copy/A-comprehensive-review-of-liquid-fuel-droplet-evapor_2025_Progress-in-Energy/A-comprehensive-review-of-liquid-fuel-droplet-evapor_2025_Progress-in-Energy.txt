Nanofuels (NFs) are an innovative fuel category where nano-scale metal or carbon-based particles are suspended
within liquid fuel (LF) to enhance performance, combustion efficiency, and emission characteristics of internal
combustion devices while preserving the base fuel properties. Carbon-nanoparticle-based nanofuels (CNFs) have
recently attracted attention for their potential to significantly enhance combustion performance and reduce
emissions. CNFs offer advantages such as lower toxicity, a reduced environmental footprint, and cost-
effectiveness compared to metal-based alternatives. Carbon nanoparticles exhibit potential in enhancing liquid
fuel combustion characteristics, particularly when used at low particle concentrations (≤0.30 % w/w), which is
likely to be optimal for improving the burning rate. This enhancement can be attributed to their superior heat
absorption and transfer properties, improved atomization mechanisms, and impact on combustion kinetics. This
review investigates the potential of CNFs and examines the mechanisms by which they alter combustion and
evaporation characteristics. Empirical evidence indicates that the increased evaporation and burning rates of
CNFs are primarily due to improved radiation capture and heat transfer. The behavior of ignition is closely
related to the aggregation and distribution of nanoparticles within CNF droplets, which affects fuel evaporation
dynamics. Additionally, increased micro-explosion intensity and generally reduced micro-explosion frequency
are observed during CNF droplet combustion. Factors such as particle size, concentration, morphology, and
thermo-physical properties play crucial roles in influencing changes in evaporation rate, burning rate, ignition
delay, burning period, and micro-explosion characteristics. Studies conducted at droplet, spray, and engine scales
consistently support the positive effects of CNFs observed at the droplet scale. These improvements lead to
enhanced combustion parameters, better engine performance and a significant reduction in harmful emissions.
However, concerns remain about the potential presence of nanoparticles in exhaust emissions and their impli-
cations for the environment and human health. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of CNFs, providing
insights into their potential applications and identifying areas that require further research.

1. Introduction

Liquid fuels (LFs) are crucial for powering a diverse range of internal
combustion systems, including diesel engines, jet engines, industrial
furnaces, and rocket propulsion systems, among others. These versatile
energy sources are fundamental to critical sectors like transportation,
power generation, industry, and agriculture, establishing a crucial link
between their performance and the modern industrial, energy, and
transportation landscapes [1–4]. The growing dependence on liquid
fuels has driven significant scientific research focused on improving the
performance, combustion efficiency, and emission characteristics of
internal combustion devices. This pursuit has manifested in four primary
pathways: (i) rethinking combustion system design, (ii) tailoring fuel
properties, (iii) integrating alternative fuels/fuel blends, and (iv)
advancing exhaust gas after-treatment processes.

combustion

While rethinking combustion system design holds promise, it often
faces formidable cost constraints and compatibility issues with existing
systems. Innovative technologies have emerged to boost fuel efficiency,
enhance engine performance, and address emissions. These advance-
ments include a range of technologies such as homogeneous charge
compression ignition (HCCI) engines [5–9,10], premixed charge
compression ignition (PCCI) engines [7,11–18], partially premixed
compression ignition (PPCI) engines [7,10,19,20], reactivity-controlled
compression ignition (RCCI) engines [7,14,10,21–30], dual direct in-
jection (DDI) engines [7,31–33], lean-burn aircraft engines [34–37],
supersonic
[42],
radio-frequency corona ignition [43], and microwave-assisted spark
ignition [44,45]. Recent efforts to improve combustion in propulsion
systems have focused on nozzle aerodynamics [46]. However, these
approaches can be costly and may not always integrate seamlessly with
existing operational combustion devices. Addressing emissions con-
cerns, particularly those related to particulate matter (PM), requires
improvements in exhaust gas after-treatment processes. The use of
alternative fuels offers potential benefits, but it also introduces several
challenges. These include lower energy density, compatibility with
combustion devices, infrastructure considerations, cost implications,
environmental concerns, and energy-intensive production processes
[47–52].

A promising approach to optimizing liquid fuels is to modify their
properties by incorporating micron or sub-micron particles. This
approach allows for flexibility in tailoring fuels to fit existing combus-
tion devices or adapting them for various types and operating condi-
tions, thereby enhancing combustion performance and optimizing
emissions. Micro-scale additives, including coal particles, aluminum,
and boron, gained prominence in the 1980s [53–55,56,57,58]. How-

agglomeration issues, heightened soot production, and poor emission
performance [53–55,56,57,58]. This setback catalyzed a transformation
in the landscape of micro particle type additives, driven by rapid ad-
vancements in nanotechnology. Nano-scale additives emerged as a
promising alternative, demonstrating enhanced ignition probability,
accelerated burning rates, and cleaner, more complete combustion when
compared to their micro-scale counterparts [46,59]. Fuels augmented
with these nano-additives earned the byname “nanofuel (NF)”.

It is important to distinguish between nanofuels and nanofluids,
which use nanoparticles for different purposes. Nanofuel is a type of fuel
mixed with nanoparticles, which are often made of metals or carbon [46,
59,60]. The main aim of adding these particles to the fuel is to improve
combustion efficiency and performance. Nanoparticles can affect com-
bustion by enhancing ignition timing, improving air-fuel mixing, pro-
moting cleaner and more efficient burning, and increasing heat release
rates [46,59]. This leads to better energy conversion in engines and
other systems. Nanofluid, on the other hand, is a heat transfer fluid with
nanoparticles suspended in a base fluid like water or oil [61–63]. The
goal of nanofluids is to improve the thermal properties of the base fluid,
such as its heat conductivity and heat transfer efficiency [61–63].
Nanofluids are used in cooling electronic devices, improving heat
exchanger performance, and managing heat in industrial processes [62].
Essentially, nanofuel and nanofluid leverage the unique properties of
nanoparticles, with nanofuel optimizing combustion while nanofluid
enhances heat transfer and thermal performance. Nanofuels are typi-
cally formulated with varying nanoparticle concentrations, and based
on existing literature, these concentrations can be categorized into
specific ranges: (i) Low particle concentration (particle concentration
≤0.10 % w/w), (ii) Medium particle concentration (0.10 % < particle
concentration ≤1.00 % w/w), (iii) High particle concentration (1.00 %
< particle concentration ≤5.00 % w/w), and (iv) Ultra-high particle
concentration (5.00 % < particle concentration ≤10.00 % w/w). While
there is not a strict definition for what qualifies as a fuel additive, it is
generally acknowledged that an additive is a substance added at less
than 1 % w/w or 1 % v/v [64–66]. Consequently, low and medium
particle concentrations can be regarded as fuel additives. Additionally, it
is important to distinguish nanofuels from slurry fuels, which typically
contain micron-sized particles at concentrations exceeding 10 % w/w
[54].

impact [46,59].

Nanofuels (NFs) can be divided into two main types: metal-
nanoparticle-based nanofuels (MNF) and carbon-nanoparticle-based
nanofuels (CNF) [46,59]. MNFs have been extensively studied with
various metal nanoparticles, including aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), boron
(B), magnesium oxide (MgO), iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3), aluminum oxide
(Al2O3), cerium (IV) oxide (CeO2), titanium dioxide (TiO2), copper (II)
oxide (CuO), and zinc oxide (ZnO) [46,59,60,67,68]. These metal
nanoparticles can enhance combustion efficiency through additional
reactivity and catalytic effects, but they may also lead to higher emis-
sions and environmental
In contrast, CNFs use
carbon-based nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon
nanoparticles (CNP), graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), graphene oxide
(GO), graphite oxide (GrO), graphite nanoparticles (GrNP), graphite
nanoplatelets (GrNPL), carbon black (CB), carbon quantum dots (CQD),
and acetylene black (AB) [59,60,67–69]. Carbon nanoparticles gener-
ally offer several advantages over metal-based ones, including lower
toxicity and reduced environmental impact [46,59]. Both MNFs and
CNFs can significantly improve the performance, combustion charac-
teristics, and emission profiles of various internal combustion devices.
They achieve this by enhancing heat transfer, increasing fuel energy
density, reducing ignition delay, through reactivity and catalytic activ-
ity, and improving fuel atomization, while also mitigating harmful
emissions [46,59]. Nanofuels can enhance automotive diesel engines by
boosting combustion efficiency, which increases power output and re-
duces emissions, thus improving both engine performance and envi-
ronmental sustainability [46,59,70–104].
In diesel generators and
power turbines, nanofuels can lower specific fuel consumption (SFC)

and improve thermal efficiency, optimizing fuel use [46,59,105–107].
Nanofuels can boost combustion efficiency in airbreathing engines,
increasing thrust and reducing fuel consumption, which cuts operational
costs and minimizes environmental impact [107,108]. In industrial
furnace boilers, nanofuels improve heat transfer rates, leading to more
efficient steam generation and reduced emissions [109,110]. In space
exploration, nanofuels boost specific impulse, enabling rockets to ach-
ieve higher speeds, carry greater payloads, and support advanced
cooling processes for safety and efficiency [111–114]. However, the
reported positive effects of CNFs can be challenged by issues related to
nanoparticle dispersion stability, as well as the observation of increased
unburnt hydrocarbons (UHCs) and NOx emissions, which have been
noted by various researchers [46,59].

◦

It is important to consider environmental and health concerns
associated with MNFs, particularly regarding the potential presence of
unburned particles and agglomerated residues in exhaust emissions [46,
59,115–117]. Metal-based nanoparticles (mNPs) have been linked to
various adverse effects, including cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, lung
inflammation, skin allergies, DNA damage, and other health issues
[118–125]. Carbon-based nanoparticles (cNPs), on the other hand,
generally exhibit lower toxicity and tend to have lower thermal degra-
dation temperatures (typically below 1000
C) [46,59]. This means that
during combustion, carbon-based nanoparticles are more likely to un-
dergo complete thermal degradation, resulting in byproducts similar to
those from the base fuel alone. In contrast, MNFs may leave residual
metal oxides and combustion byproducts in the exhaust, posing chal-
lenges for applications with stringent emission regulations [116,117,
126]. Overall, MNFs are particularly promising for propulsion applica-
tions where increasing the volumetric energy density of the base fuel is
critical, while CNFs excel
transfer
enhancement [46,59]. CNFs are also more cost-effective as fuel additives
compared to metal-based counterparts [59]. The choice between MNFs
and CNFs often depends on the specific requirements of the application
and the trade-offs between performance, emissions, and environmental
impact.

in applications requiring heat

Spray combustion stands as the predominant method by which liquid
fuels are utilized within internal combustion devices, encompassing a
wide spectrum from diesel engines to rocket and jet engines. Our un-
derstanding of LF combustion is rooted in empirical observations drawn
from experiments involving both droplet and spray flames. These ob-
servations have provided invaluable insights into engine performance
[118,119]. Understanding spherical symmetric fuel droplet combustion
is crucial for comprehending the thermo-physical mechanisms involved
in spray flames. Such experiments are fundamental to reveal the com-
bustion dynamics of isolated liquid fuel droplets, which depend on the
transport and thermodynamic properties of both the liquid fuel and the
surrounding gas. The " d2-law” is a well-established tool for quantifying
diverse combustion and evaporation characteristics at the droplet scale
[127,128,129]. Consequently, investigating the burning and evapora-
tion characteristics of carbon-nanoparticle-based nanofuel (CNF) drop-
lets is crucial which reveals the complex thermo-physio-chemical
mechanisms that contribute to improved combustion and emission
performance.

(SMD), which represents

the Sauter mean diameter

Understanding the burning and evaporation of individual droplets is
complex because droplet sizes in actual fuel sprays often differ signifi-
cantly from those used in controlled experiments. In combustion de-
vices,
the
characteristic droplet size within sprays, varies by application. For
example, droplets typically range from 5 to 100 μm in diesel engines,
1–10 μm in jet engines, and 100–500 μm in rocket engines [130–140].
However, in combustion or evaporation experiments, droplet sizes are
typically larger, ranging from 100 to 5000 μm [46,59,60]. This
discrepancy arises because controlled experiments often use larger
droplets to simplify observations and measurements, in contrast to the
smaller droplets common in practical fuel spray applications. Due to
limitations in imaging technology and time scales, studying the

combustion and evaporation of very small droplets, like those found in
real fuel sprays, is extremely challenging. It is important to recognize
that experiments on droplet combustion and evaporation simplify the
more complex process of spray combustion. Spray combustion involves
multiple phases, chemical reactions, heat and mass transfer, and phase
changes, whereas droplet combustion experiments primarily focus on
basic transport mechanisms and combustion processes. The insights
gained from these experiments form the foundation for modeling the
behavior of actual-sized droplets in various spray combustion devices.
While most reviews have concentrated on metal-nanoparticle-based
nanofuels (MNFs) when discussing nanofuel droplet evaporation and
combustion [46,47,59,60,67–69], there is a compelling case for focusing
on carbon-nanoparticle-based nanofuels (CNFs) due to their distinct
advantages. CNFs offer several benefits over MNFs. They have lower
environmental impact, aligning with the growing emphasis on sustain-
ability [59,141,142]. Their raw materials are readily available and can
be sourced sustainably and cost-effectively, supporting a stable supply
chain for large-scale applications [59]. CNFs also feature exceptional
heat transfer properties, improving combustion efficiency, enhancing
engine performance, and reducing emissions. Their potential catalytic
effects can further optimize combustion kinetics, leading to more com-
plete fuel combustion [46,59]. CNFs are compatible with existing fuel
formulations, easing integration into current systems with minimal
modifications [46]. Furthermore, CNFs are versatile across various en-
gine types, including internal combustion engines, turbines, and rockets
[46,59,111,112]. By exploring the unique attributes of CNFs, this
manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive understanding and stim-
ulate further research and development in this promising field.

The structure of this review is outlined as follows: In Section 2, the
fundamental attributes distinguishing commercially viable carbon-
nanoparticle-based nanofuels (CNFs) are defined. Section 3 introduces
the methodologies used in preparing CNFs, including discussions on
stability trends and an examination of their important properties rele-
vant to combustion application. Section 4 offers a comprehensive dis-
cussion on how nanoparticles influence thermal conductivity, thermal
radiation absorption, and particle aggregation during droplet evapora-
tion and combustion and their impacts. It also includes a brief overview
on catalytic activity related to CNFs. Section 5 provides an overview of
the various experimental techniques employed for CNF droplet evapo-
ration and combustion, emphasizing the influence of experimental ar-
tifacts. Sections 6 and 7 elaborate on distinct CNF droplet evaporation

and combustion experiments, respectively, presenting key findings and
observations. In Section 8 briefly touches upon outcomes from studies
concerning spray characteristics and engine-scale experiments involving
CNFs. Section 9 examines the possible environmental and health risks
related to the use of CNFs. In Section 10, the main findings from the CNF
droplet evaporation and combustion experiments are summarized. The
review then wraps up with Section 11, which explores potential avenues
for future research, suggesting areas where further investigation could
deepen our understanding and lead to advancements in CNF combustion
technology.

2. Defining characteristics of commercially viable CNFs

Before thoroughly exploring carbon-nanoparticle-based nanofuels
(CNFs), it is essential to first establish the fundamental properties and
behaviors that determine their suitability for combustion applications.
Carbon nanoparticles offer a promising approach to optimizing the
combustion performance and emissions of liquid fuels. However, the
effectiveness of CNFs depends on aligning their properties with the
specific requirements of different combustion devices and environ-
mental regulations. The concept of an “ideal liquid fuel” is not univer-
sally applicable because different engines and technologies have distinct
needs. There is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Therefore, there is no
universally agreed-upon definition of an “ideal CNF”. Instead, it is more
practical to consider the properties and traits of “commercially viable
CNFs”, understanding that these attributes may vary based on their
intended applications. This approach enables a more tailored and
context-specific evaluation of CNFs’ potential
in liquid fuels. The
applicability of carbon nanoparticles as fuel additives can be divided
into five areas:

• Enhancing conventional liquid fossil fuels: Carbon based nano-
particles (cNPs) should improve combustion and reduce emissions
when added to traditional liquid fossil fuels like diesel and jet fuel,
without requiring modifications to existing combustion systems.

• Compatibility with alternative fuels: cNPs

should exhibit
compatibility with alternative liquid fuels, such as biodiesel and
sustainable aviation fuels, while maintaining combustion behaviors
and emissions on par with conventional fossil fuels.

• Enhancing alternative fuels: When integrated with alternative
fuels, cNPs should enhance combustion performance and reduce

emissions compared to conventional fossil fuels, without requiring
combustion system modifications.

• Blend compatibility: cNPs should be compatible with fuel blends
comprising both conventional and alternative fuels, ensuring
consistent combustion behavior and emissions, again without system
modifications.

• Specialized applications: Beyond combustion performance and
emissions improvement, cNPs may find utility in specialized appli-
cations, such as serving as fire retardant additives [143] or acceler-
ating in-situ burning of crude oil spillage [144]. cNPs can also
enhance the volumetric energy density of fuel (above high particle
concentration >5.00 % w/w) which is typically applicable for pro-
pulsion application [145,146]. Furthermore, cNPs were reported to
enhance the regenerative cooling performance of cryogenic rocket
applications without degrading combustion characteristics of liquid
propellant (Isrosense) [111].

Based on the above-mentioned applications, some important char-
acteristics of “Commercially viable CNFs” can be identified, which are
discussed below:

• Physical properties consistency: CNFs should exhibit physical
properties (e.g., density, viscosity, surface tension) similar to those of
the base fuel to ensure smooth operation within existing pumping
systems. These properties should remain relatively stable, consid-
ering the minute treat rate of additives (<1.00 % w/w or 1.00 % v/v)
[64–66].

• Thermal properties enhancement: CNFs should possess superior
thermal properties compared to base fuels, as enhanced heat transfer
properties are a primary factor contributing to improved combustion
performance and emissions reduction. Although there have been
discussions regarding the catalytic activity of cNPs, conclusive evi-
dence remains limited, as elaborated in Section 4.4.

• Complete combustion: cNPs should undergo complete thermal
degradation within the combustion chamber to prevent adverse
environmental and health effects associated with particle emissions
through the exhaust.

• Stability and shelf Life: CNFs should exhibit prolonged suspension
stability, typically in the order of months, to be viable for commercial
applications. The specific stability period depends on the intended
use. Furthermore, CNFs should maintain good thermo-physical and
chemical stability during the shelf life.

• Performance Enhancement: CNFs should demonstrably enhance
combustion performance and reduce emissions compared to base
fuels. While no established quantitative benchmarks exist for these
enhancements, cost-effective analyses coupled with carbon cycle
assessments can help define attractive outcome ranges.

• Compatibility: For applications beyond combustion performance
and emissions improvement, such as regenerative cooling, CNFs
should not compromise the combustion performance, physical
properties, or chemical characteristics of the base fuel.

The properties of “commercially viable CNFs” are complex and
closely tied to their specific combustion applications. There is no single
definition of an “ideal CNF”; their value lies in their adaptability to the
unique needs and challenges of each application.

3. Preparation methods and stability of CNFs

3.1. Common carbon-based nanoparticles as liquid fuel additive

cNPs have attracted attention in scientific and engineering fields due
to their exceptional physical, chemical, optical, mechanical, and ther-
mal properties. They are promising fuel additives thanks to their
impressive thermo-physical, chemical, and morphological attributes,
especially their heat transfer capabilities. cNPs explored for combustion

applications include Carbon Nanotubes (CNT), Graphene Oxide (GO),
Graphene Nanoplatelets (GNP), Graphite Oxide (GrO), Carbon Black
(CB), Carbon Nanoparticles (CNP), Acetylene Black (AB), Graphite
Nanoparticles (GrNP), Carbon Quantum Dots (CQD), and Graphite
Nanoplatelets (GrNPL) [46,59,60]. These cNPs can be categorized based
on their dimensional structure, spanning 0D (spherical forms-CNP, CQD,
AB), 1D (tube and wire forms-CNT), 2D (sheet and plate forms-GO,
GNP), and 3D (complex 3D structures-GrNP, GrNPL) [147]. Fig. 1
shows different types of cNPs explored as fuel additives.

CNTs, belonging to the fullerene family, are one-dimensional nano-
particles characterized by their high aspect ratio (typically 300–1000).
They can be synthesized through various methods, including laser
ablation, arc discharge, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and more
[148,149]. CNTs can be further categorized into Single Walled Carbon
Nanotubes (SWCNTs) and Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs).
SWCNTs have diameters typically ranging from 0.80 to 2.00 nm, while
MWCNTs have diameters of 5–20 nm, although they can exceed 100 nm.
CNTs exhibit a thermal conductivity range of 3000–3500 W/mK [147].
Their noteworthy properties include high flexibility, a large surface
area, exceptional mechanical strength, low weight, electron-rich char-
acteristics, and excellent chemical and thermal stability. CNTs have
diverse applications, including reinforcement in composite materials,
electronics, sensors, drug delivery systems, and energy storage devices.
Graphene, a two-dimensional nanoparticle, can be viewed as the
fundamental building block of various carbon structures, including
graphite, carbon nanotubes, and fullerene. Synthesis methods for gra-
phene encompass mechanical exfoliation, chemical exfoliation, chemi-
cal synthesis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and thermal decomposition of SiC
[148,149]. Single-layer graphene possesses an impressive thermal con-
ductivity of approximately 5000 W/mK, making it one of
the
best-known thermal conductors [147]. It also has excellent electrical
conductivity. Graphene is used in various fields, including flexible
conductive films, energy storage (e.g.,
electronics,
graphene-based batteries and supercapacitors), and sensors.
Its
single-atom thickness,
two-dimensional structure, and exceptional
thermal properties make graphene an attractive material for advanced
electronic and thermal management applications.

transparent

Graphene Oxide (GO), Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO), and Gra-
phene Nanoplatelets (GNP) are derivatives of graphene. Both GO and
GNP have thermal properties similar to graphene due to their graphene-
derived structures. GO is used in composites, membranes, and biomed-
ical applications, while GNP finds use in enhancing the mechanical and
thermal properties of materials. GO’s tunable surface chemistry and
GNP’s platelet-like morphology offer versatility for various applications,
including mechanical reinforcement and separation processes.

Graphite nanoparticles (GrNP) and Graphite nanoplatelets (GrNPL)
represent three-dimensional carbon nanoparticles characterized by their
stacked graphene layers. They exhibit excellent thermal conductivity,
typically around 5000 W/mK, due to their layered graphite structure
including
[147]. GrNPs have found applications in various areas,
nanocomposite materials, lubricants, conductive coatings, and thermal
management. They are often used as fillers to enhance the thermal and
electrical properties of composites and coatings. Graphite nanoparticles
(GrNP), owing to their high thermal conductivity and electrical con-
ductivity, are valuable additives in materials requiring improved heat
transfer or electrical properties. They are particularly useful in appli-
cations where the layered structure of graphite can be beneficial, such as
in lubrication and conductive materials. GrNPLs are utilized in various
applications, including nanocomposites, conductive coatings, energy
storage, and thermal management systems. GrNPLs are distinguished by
their unique layered structure, similar to graphite and graphene. This
structure allows them to provide high thermal conductivity and elec-
trical conductivity, making them valuable additives in materials and
coatings that require enhanced thermal and electrical performance.
Their wide surface area and structural flexibility make them versatile in

various applications.

Carbon black (CB) and Acetylene black (AB) are quasi-graphitic zero-
dimensional particles with high specific surface areas. They are known
for their practical isotropy and combustibility. CB exhibits a thermal
conductivity of approximately 50 W/mK [150] and is commonly
employed as a reinforcing agent in rubber products, inks, paints, and as a
black pigment in various materials.

Carbon Nanoparticles (CNP), zero-dimensional spherical carbon
nanoparticles, exhibit thermal properties influenced by factors such as
size and structure [147]. They find applications in nanocomposites, drug
delivery systems, and as additives to enhance the thermal properties of
polymers. Their versatility allows tailoring for specific applications

Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs) are a relatively recent discovery,
featuring quasi-spherical zero-dimensional carbon nanoparticles. They
are known for their non-toxic and biocompatible nature, making them
attractive for various applications including biomedical and optical
applications [151,152]. The typical size of CQDs is less than 20 nm.
These dots consist of a single atomic layer of nano-sized graphite, with
surface structures that can vary based on synthesis methods and pre-
cursors [151,152]. These structural variations significantly affect their
thermo-physical, optical, and electrical properties. CQDs generally
possess thermal properties similar to amorphous carbon structures.
CQDs are emerging materials with potential applications in optoelec-
tronics, photovoltaics, bioimaging, and sensors. Their properties can be
tuned based on size and surface functionalization [151,152].

Carbon nanoparticles offer a wide array of capabilities, and their
properties can be fine-tuned for specific applications. However, it is
essential to note that variations in properties may arise due to synthesis
techniques, structural defects, and functionalization, necessitating pre-
cise characterization for tailored applications. Properties of common
cNPs are listed in Table S1.

3.2. Preparation methods of CNFs

cNPs dispersion characteristics within base liquids or fuels depend
significantly on the chosen preparation methods, which, in turn, can
influence the thermo-physical properties of the resulting nanofluids or
nanofuels. Nanofuels are more than just mixtures of solid nanoparticles
and liquid; they require specific conditions for homogeneity, physical
and chemical stability, durability, and dispersibility. Two primary ap-
proaches are commonly employed in nanofluid preparation: the one-
step method, known as the bottom-up approach, and the two-step
method, referred to as the top-down approach.

3.2.1. One-step method/bottom-up approach

The one-step method seamlessly integrates the production or syn-
thesis of nanoparticles with their dispersion in the base liquid, all in a
single process step [61–63]. This approach encompasses various tech-
niques, including physical vapor deposition, liquid chemical deposition,

7

submerged arc nanoparticle synthesis, laser ablation, and high-energy
irradiation [61–63]. As an example, consider the vapor deposition
technique, which involves the transformation of nanoparticles originally
in a gaseous phase into the base fluid [69]. As shown in Fig. 2a, the
process involves forming a thin film of the base liquid on the vessel wall
due to the centrifugal force of a rotating disk, followed by heating and
evaporating the raw materials in a resistively heated crucible [69]. The
vapor then condenses into nano-sized particles within the presence of a
cold base liquid film, resulting in the formation of a nanofluid. One-step
methods offer several advantages. They mitigate issues related to drying,
storage, transportation, and nanoparticle dispersion, minimizing nano-
particle agglomeration and enhancing nanofluid stability [61–63].
Nanofluids prepared through this method often exhibit a narrower size
distribution, thereby extending their stability period. However, this
method has drawbacks, including the presence of residual reactants
from nanoparticle synthesis, which can be difficult to remove and may
act as contaminants. Additionally, it is compatible only with low vapor
pressure fluids, limiting its commercial viability due to the associated
high production costs and impurity levels [61–63]. Importantly, all re-
ported CNFs in the literature have been prepared using the two-step
method. Therefore, further discussion related to the one-step method
falls outside the scope of this manuscript.

3.2.2. Two-step method/top-down approach

The two-step method involves the independent synthesis or collec-
tion of nanoparticles, followed by their subsequent mixing or dispersion
in the base liquid [61–63]. This mixing or dispersion is typically ach-
ieved through the use of methods such as magnetic stirrers, ultrasonic
baths, homogenizers, high-shear mixers, or bead mills. To enhance
stability and reduce agglomeration, dispersants or surfactants may also
be added. Fig. 2b outlines the general steps of the two-step method,
which is the preferred choice for preparing nanofuels due to its
cost-effectiveness, scalability, and the availability of well-characterized
nanoparticles from various manufacturers [61–63]. Despite these ad-
vantages, the two-step approach does present a challenge in the form of
greater particle aggregation, mainly due to a wider particle size distri-
bution when compared to the one-step method [61–63]. Nevertheless, it
remains the most popular route for producing nanofluids, whether in
large or small quantities, and is versatile enough to synthesize a wide
range of nanofuels.

3.3. Stability of CNFs

Securing the long-term stability of CNFs stands as a key challenge in
meeting commercial prerequisites and prolonging product shelf life, all
while safeguarding their indispensable thermos-physical attributes.
Various liquid fuels exhibit distinct recommended storage periods or
shelf lives, typically spanning from 1 to 12 months (e.g., Diesel: ~12
months, Gasoline: 3–6 months, Ethanol: 1–3 months, Biodiesel: ~2–12
months) [153]. The stability of CNFs is influenced by several factors,
including the shelf life of the base fuel and the intricate interplay

A.S.M.S. Parveg and A. Ratner

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101198

between particle-particle and liquid-particle interactions [154,63,155].
The stability duration of CNFs is determined by the balance between van
der Waals attractive forces and electrical double layer repulsive forces
[154,63,155]. van der Waals attractive forces tend to induce particle
aggregation, resulting in the formation of clusters or agglomerates that
eventually settle at the liquid’s bottom due to gravitational forces.
Conversely, electrical double layer repulsive forces operate to maintain
particle separation through steric and electrostatic repulsion mecha-
nisms [154,63,155]. When the repulsive force dominates the attractive
force during collisions, often facilitated by Brownian motion, the CNF
retains relative stability; otherwise, instability prevails. Nanofuel’s sta-
bility can be enhanced through two key mechanisms: steric repulsion
and electrostatic repulsion [154,63,155]. Steric repulsion relies on
specific surfactants or dispersants to prevent nanoparticle aggregation
within the base fuel [154,63,155]. These surfactants typically possess
hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails. The hydrophilic head adheres
to the nanoparticle surface, forming an extended loop, while the hy-
drophobic tail extends into the liquid phase. CNFs stabilized via steric
repulsion can thus remain well-dispersed and maintain stability for
extended durations. In contrast, electrostatic stabilization involves the
acquisition of a charge by nanoparticles in base liquid through ion
adsorption [154,63,155]. This leads to the formation of an electrical
double layer around the nanoparticles, generating a repulsive force that
counters the attractive forces between nanoparticles. Electrostatic
repulsion primarily relies on ion adsorption, which is generally
achievable in polar liquids. However, since liquid fuels are typically
non-polar, steric repulsion techniques are more commonly employed to
attain the necessary stability duration for CNFs.

3.3.1. Stability enhancement and evaluation methods for CNFs

Several approaches can be utilized to enhance stability, including
adding surfactants or dispersants, modifying particle surfaces, applying
mechanical agitation, and controlling pH levels [154,63,155].

Surfactant addition: Surfactant addition represents a widely
adopted and cost-effective strategy for enhancing stability. It achieves
this by introducing steric repulsion forces through the hydrophobic tail
portion (e.g., long-chain hydrocarbons) and hydrophilic polar head
groups [155,156]. This interaction augments the hydrophilic behavior
between the base fuel and nanoparticles. Surfactants can be categorized
into four groups based on their head group compositions [155,156]:

• Ionic surfactants with negatively charged head groups (e.g., alkyl
sulfates, long-chain fatty acids, phosphates, sulfosuccinates, and
sulfonates).

• Nonionic surfactants with neutral head groups (e.g., alcohols, poly-

ethylene oxide, and other polar groups).

• Cationic surfactants with positively charged head groups (e.g., long-
chain quaternary ammonium compounds and long-chain amines).

• Amphoteric surfactants with zwitterionic head groups (charge

dependent on pH).

The selection of surfactants depends on the polarity of the base
liquid. Polar solvents necessitate water-soluble surfactants, while non-
polar solvents require oil-soluble variants [63,155,156]. For nonionic
surfactants, the HLB value (hydrophilic/lipophilic balance) can guide
the selection based on solubility. Higher HLB values denote greater
water solubility, while lower values indicate higher oil solubility [155,
156]. It is essential to note that surfactants can exhibit temperature
sensitivity, with elevated temperatures potentially compromising in-
teractions between nanoparticles and surfactants. In some cases, this can
result in foaming and chemical reactions [154,63,155,156]. Further-
more, surfactant addition may impact the thermo-physical properties
and combustion characteristics of CNFs, particularly ignition and
micro-explosion behavior [46,59,60]. The impact of these effects de-
pends heavily on the concentration of surfactants, making it essential to
conduct focused studies to better understand their role in droplet
evaporation and combustion behavior in liquid fuels. Notably, when the
base fuel is inherently polar, such as ethanol, achieving a satisfactory
stability period without surfactant addition is more attractive [46,59,
60].

Particle surface modification: Surface modification of nano-
particles offers an alternative approach to enhance CNF stability without
relying on surfactants [156]. This technique involves the functionali-
zation of nanoparticle surfaces to promote self-stabilization within the
base fuel. Typically, functional organic groups are selected for their
propensity to attach to atomic surfaces, facilitating self-organization and
deterring agglomeration. Functional groups can be introduced in a
single-step process or through intermediate reactions [155,156]. Surface
modification/functionalization is particularly attractive for CNF com-
mercial applications as it eliminates the need for additional chemicals
like surfactants.

Mechanical agitation: Mechanical agitation serves as a valuable
means to improve the stability period of nanofuels by disrupting
attractive forces within nanoparticle sediments. Various techniques,
including magnetic stirring, ultrasonication, homogenizers, and high
shear mixing, can be employed [154,63,155,156]. Ultrasonication, in
particular, stands out as the most effective method for breaking down
large nanoparticle clusters into smaller clusters or individual nano-
particles. Ultrasonication techniques encompass bath and probe types,
with probe-type ultrasonication being more effective, powerful, and
providing better control and reproducibility during the preparation
process [154,156]. Enhancing CNF stability through mechanical agita-
tion involves optimizing parameters such as ultrasonication time, tip
size, power, and the choice between continuous and discontinuous
ultrasonication [154]. However, the optimization of these parameters

morphology, properties, and base fuel characteristics. Conflicting con-
clusions regarding the effects of ultrasonication time, power, and vi-
bration amplitude necessitate further investigation, particularly in the
context of CNFs [154]. Mechanical agitation is often complemented by
surfactant addition or surface modification of nanoparticles to further
enhance the stability of CNFs.

pH Control: The pH value plays an important role in influencing the
stability period of nanofuels, as it directly relates to electrokinetic
properties [154,63,155,156]. Modulating the pH of a nanofluid can be
achieved by adding non-reactive alkaline or acidic solutions, enabling
tunable stability periods based on the properties of the base liquid.

The stability analysis of CNFs is a critical aspect of their utilization in
various applications. Several techniques are employed to analyze the
stability periods of CNFs including Zeta potential analysis, visual
observation, spectral analysis and microscopic image analysis [154,63,
155,156].

Zeta potential analysis: This approach is grounded in the electro-
phoretic behavior of the nanofluid [155,156]. The liquid layer sur-
rounding the particles comprises two distinct regions: the inner stern
layer and the outer diffuse layer. Within the inner region, ions are firmly
bound, while in the outer region, they are loosely associated. A notional
boundary within the outer layer delineates the formation of a stable
entity between particles and ions, termed zeta potential. Notably, high
absolute zeta potential values (>±60 mV) indicate excellent stability,
±(40–60) mV imply good stability, ±(30–40) mV are considered stable,
and <±30 mV signify high agglomeration [154,63,155,156].

Visual observation: Visual observation or sedimentation photo-
graph analysis provides a straightforward and cost-effective method for
characterizing the stability period of CNFs [154,63,155,156]. This
approach involves observing changes in the volume of clustered nano-
particles within a nanofuel under the influence gravitational forces
which influence the sedimentation of nanoparticles. Stability assessment
relies on observing changes in particle size and dispersity over time.
Onset of sedimentation or agglomeration is typically detected from the
formation of clustered nanoparticles at the bottom of the tube [154,63,
155,156]. In unstable nanofluids, three sedimentation behaviors can be
observed: dispersed sedimentation, where sediment height gradually
increases from the bottom as the solution clarifies; flocculated sedi-
mentation, where sediment height reduces over time; and mixed sedi-
mentation, where
occur
simultaneously (see Fig. 3) [155].

Spectral analysis: This technique leverages the absorption spec-
trum, which varies with nanoparticle morphology, to characterize
nanoparticle size distribution in a nanofluid [154,63,155,156]. The
relationship between absorption intensity and nanoparticle concentra-
tion within the nanofluid offers quantitative insights into concentration
variations. UV–Vis spectral analyzers can be employed to determine
changes in sedimentation time (time it takes for particles to settle) with
supernatant particle concentration by measuring nanofluid absorption
[154,63,155,156]. A notable advantage of this method is its capacity to
provide quantitative concentration data from stability analysis.

tion, these advanced microscopes enable the identification of nano-

The stability of CNFs is crucial for their effectiveness, especially in
combustion-related applications. Long-term stability not only affects the
fuel’s thermo-physical properties but also its combustion performance,
including ignition, evaporation, and emissions characteristics. Given its
importance, researchers use various methods to analyze and monitor
CNF stability over time, providing valuable insights into nanoparticle
interactions, resistance to agglomeration, and overall fuel stability

Insights from experimental studies

Recent research has explored various techniques for preparing CNFs,
each yielding distinct outcomes in terms of stability duration. These
methods include ultrasonication, magnetic stirring, and their combina-
tions, using various nanoparticles and base fuels. The choice of prepa-
ration technique, nanoparticle type,
surfactant, and base fuel
significantly impact CNF stability.

fuel

surfactants,

In the absence of surfactants, Hentges et al. [157] prepared CNFs
through ultrasonication, using AB, MWCNTs, and GNPs with renewable
jet
(RJF). MWCNTs-based CNFs exhibited superior stability
compared to AB and GNPs-based CNFs, attributed to their higher spe-
cific surface area (SSA). Mosadegh et al. [158] examined CNFs based on
three types of GO (hGO, pGO, rGO) and ethanol as the base fuel. Using
bath-type ultrasonication without
they found CNFs
remained stable for 10–15 min at lower particle concentrations (0.01 %
w/w) and at least 60 min at higher concentrations (0.10 % w/w),
challenging the belief that higher particle loading reduces stability. Gan
et al. [159] investigated CNFs based on SWCNTs, MWCNTs, and CNPs
with ethanol as the base fuel. Employing bath-type ultrasonication
without
they observed varying stability durations.
SWCNTs-based CNFs were stable for less than 5 min, MWCNTs-based
CNFs exhibited an impressive four-week stability, while CNPs-based
CNFs remained stable for over 24 h. Ooi et al. [160] explored
GrO-based CNFs with diesel and palm-oil-based biodiesel as the base
fuels, relying solely on ultrasonication for 30 min without surfactants,
achieving stability for at least 60 min.

surfactants,

A key approach for improving CNF stability has been the combined
use of surfactants and ultrasonication. Choi et al. [150] applied this
technique to produce stable CB/ethanol CNFs. They used Triton X-100
as a surfactant at 1.00 % v/v and a probe-type sonicator for a 30-min
ultrasonication process, resulting in an impressive stability period
exceeding one month. Similarly, Ghamari et al. [161] prepared

Jet-A-based CNFs with CNPs, MWCNTs, MWCNTs-OH, and GNPs,
incorporating Span80 (Sorbitan Monooleate) as a surfactant at 1.50 %
w/w. They used probe-type sonication, with CNPs and GNPs undergoing
a 5-min sonication, and MWCNTs and MWCNTs-OH sonicated for 20
min, achieving a stability duration of 60 min. Aboalhamayie et al. [162]
investigated CNFs based on CNPs, MWCNTs, and GNPs with Jet-A as the
base fuel. Their method combined magnetic stirring and ultrasonication
for 30 min, complemented by Span 80 at 3.00 % w/w as a surfactant,
resulting in a stable period of at least 60 min.

Furthermore, the influence of surface functionalization on CNF sta-
bility was explored by Rentería et al. [163], who investigated
amide-functionalized and non-functionalized MWCNTs. CNFs prepared
through ultrasonication without surfactants yielded intriguing results.
Functionalized MWCNTs-based CNFs displayed superior stability, per-
sisting for at least 24 h, whereas non-functionalized variants experi-
enced sedimentation after 24 h due to steric effects induced by the
functional groups. Notably, CNFs based on biodiesel, regardless of
functionalization, demonstrated no visible sedimentation during the
observation period.

These studies highlight that the choice of preparation method,
especially when it involves ultrasonication and surfactants, significantly
influences CNF stability. Certain nanoparticles, like MWCNTs, have
shown promise for achieving extended stability. Factors such as sur-
factant concentration, particle concentration, and sonication time are
critical and can be optimized to enhance CNF stability. Researchers
looking to design CNFs for long-term stability should carefully consider
these factors, with ultrasonication being a particularly promising tech-
nique. Exploring surfactant-free methods through nanoparticle surface
functionalization is also an area of interest. Additionally, it is essential to

quantify and characterize the behavior of particles and aggregates, as
visual observation alone may not provide the necessary data to under-
stand how they affect CNF properties. Analyzing aggregate formation

3.4. Important properties of CNFs

Recent research has explored the impact of cNPs addition on the
properties of base fuels, necessitating the characterization of these
properties as “effective” to distinguish them from those of the base fuel
[69,155]. The term “effective” is used to describe the altered properties
resulting from the presence of nanoparticles in a base fluid/fuel. These
properties include effective density (ρeff ), effective dynamic viscosity
(μeff ), effective surface tension (σeff ), effective specific heat (Cp,eff ),
effective thermal diffusivity (αeff ) and effective thermal conductivity
(Keff ). The subsequent discussion provides insights into observed trends
in these properties concerning variations in particle concentration,
particle size, particle type, ambient conditions, base fuel properties, and
nanoparticle properties, except for effective thermal conductivity (Keff )
which will be extensively discussed on Section 4.1.

Effective density (ρeff ) of CNF primarily a function of particle con-
centration (% w/w) or solid volume fraction (fv), particle density (ρnp),
and base fuel density (ρbf ). The analytical expression of effective density
(ρeff ) is provided in equation (1) (see Table 1) [69,155]. As long as the

The influence of particle concentration on various properties of CNFs
were experimentally investigated with GrNPL/n-decane NFs under at-
mospheric ambient conditions (as shown in Fig. 4) [164].

Both ρeff and μeff exhibited an upward trend with increasing particle
concentration, while σeff showed a parabolic trend. As expected, ρeff
increased linearly with increasing particle concentrations while increase
in μeff is more significant at high concentration (1.00–4.00 % w/w) (see
Fig. 4a and b) [164]. At high particle concentration, intensified shear
effects (non-Newtonian) can be expected from CNFs. With increasing
particle concentration, σeff first increased reaching maximum value at
2.00 % w/w and after that started to decrease showing highly non-linear
trends of σeff (see Fig. 4c) [164]. At lower particle concentrations,
accumulated particles at the liquid -gas interface can get closer due to
van der Waals force, reducing the average distance between nano-
particles and base fuel molecules, and eventually leading to the increase
of surface tension. However, at certain particle concentration (2.00 %
w/w for the reported case), conformation energy of the aggregates will
increase which will enhance the dissociation tendency of aggregates.
This will reduce surface tension as can be observed from Fig. 4c for
beyond 2.00 % w/w particle concentration. linear enhancement in
effective thermal conductivity (Keff ) with increasing particle concen-
tration had been reported too. Effects of different particle concentration

crucial role in CNF heat transfer characteristics. The widely accepted
analytical expression for effective specific heat (Cp,eff ) of CNFs can be
expressed as equation (2) (Table 1) [69,155]. Effective dynamic vis-
cosity (μeff ) can be defined as the nanofluid’s resistance to flow. The
advantages associated with CNFs heat enhancement potential can be
counteracted by an increase in effective dynamic viscosity (μeff ). Most
accepted expression for the effective viscosity (μeff ) is given as equations
(3) and (4) (see Table 1) [69,155]. Effective thermal diffusivity (αeff )
depends on effective density (ρeff ), effective specific heat (Cp,eff ), and
effective thermal conductivity (Keff ) which can be expressed as equation
(5) (refer Table 1) [69,155]. The effective surface tension (σeff ) repre-
sents the modified surface tension of the base fuel due to the presence of
nanoparticles. While it can vary with nanoparticle concentration and
other factors, deriving an analytical expression σeff is not as straight-
forward, often requiring experimental determination. Table 1 compiles
well-recognized analytical expressions for various properties of CNFs

It is crucial to note that these expressions provide a theoretical
framework for comprehending the important properties of CNFs. In
practice, experimental measurements may be necessary to accurately
determine these properties since they can depend on various factors,
including nanoparticle type, concentration, and base fluid properties.

effective specific heat (Cp,eff ) with increasing ambient temperature
[108]. Tanvir et al. investigated the latent heat of vaporization (Hfg) of
water and ethanol-based nanofluids containing Ag, Fe, and Al nano-
particles using both experimental measurements and molecular dy-
namics simulations [166]. They found that even a small addition of
nanoparticles can significantly alter the Hfg of the base fluid. The di-
rection of this change (increase or decrease) depends on the strength of
the bond between the nanoparticles and the fluid molecules: stronger
bonds lead to an increase in Hfg, while weaker bonds result in a decrease.
The type of base fluid had minimal impact on these changes. Addi-
tionally, simulations showed that increasing nanoparticle size further
reduces Hfg. This reduction occurs because larger nanoparticles lead to a
greater proportion of core atoms being shielded by surface atoms, which
decreases the number of interactions between nanoparticle atoms and
base fluid molecules. Separately, the effect of particle concentration
(0.00–4.00 % w/w) on the boiling point and latent heat of vaporization
was studied using GrNPL/n-decane nanofluids under atmospheric con-
ditions [164]. The study showed that varying GrNPL concentration had
little influence on the boiling point, with a maximum difference of about
C (<0.60 %) (see Fig. 6). However, as the GrNPL concentration
1.00
increased to 4.00 % w/w, the latent heat of vaporization decreased by
over 3.60 %. The latent heat of vaporization in nanofluids is influenced
by the enthalpy of vaporization of both the base fuel and the nano-
particles, as well as the nanoparticle concentration and size.

◦

The studies mentioned above clearly demonstrate that factors such as
particle type, particle shape, ambient conditions, base fuel properties,
and nanoparticle characteristics significantly influence the properties of
the base fuel. However, comprehensive research on CNF properties,
particularly across a wide range of concentrations, remains limited,
indicating a need for further investigation in this area. Table S2 provides
a summary of the reported properties of various CNFs. Moreover, the
current literature lacks sufficient information on the chemical properties
of CNFs. While most studies focus on their physical properties such as
viscosity, density, surface tension, and flash point, and some examine
thermal properties like heat of vaporization, boiling point, and heat
capacity, detailed analyses of chemical properties are largely absent.
These include crucial factors like reactivity, oxidation state, flamma-
bility, catalytic activity, and chemical stability. To optimize CNF for-
mulations and enhance their application in liquid fuels, it is essential to
thoroughly investigate these chemical properties.

4. Key mechanisms governing CNF droplet combustion and
evaporation

4.1. Effect of carbon nanoparticles on the thermal conductivity of base
liquid

Thermal conductivity of the liquid phase is crucial for heat transfer in
burning or evaporating CNF droplets, with heat conduction being the
main mechanism [167]. Adding carbon nanoparticles to the base liquid
markedly improves thermal conductivity, with the level of improvement
influenced by factors such as the temperature of the liquid phase, par-
ticle properties and particle concentration. The combustion process of
CNF droplet can be characterized by distinct phases, each influenced by
the heat transfer characteristics of nanofuels. Initially, as the droplet is
exposed to a heat source, typically the ignition mechanism, it undergoes
a transient heating phase [127,128,168,167,169–173]. During this
stage, the outer surface of the droplet heats more rapidly than its inte-
rior, resulting in a temperature gradient. Heat travels from the heat
source to the droplet’s surface and then inward. The primary goal during
this phase is to elevate the droplet’s temperature to the boiling point of
the base fuel, and as a consequence, energy allocated for evaporation
remains relatively low. The duration of this initial heating period de-
pends on how efficiently heat is conducted from the heat source to the
droplet’s surface and further into its interior. After ignition, the

surrounding diffusion flame becomes the primary heat source for the
droplet. During this phase, the droplet’s surface absorbs heat from the
flame, primarily through conduction and radiation absorption (refer
Section 4.2), assuming convection playing a negligible role. Once again,
the enhanced thermal conductivity facilitated by carbon nanoparticles
aids efficient energy transport from the droplet’s surface to its interior,
thereby promotes more rapid evaporation, which, in turn, accelerates
the overall combustion process. However, it is important to note that
higher nanoparticle concentrations can introduce opposing influences,
often due to agglomeration phenomena (refer Section 4.3), which must
be carefully considered.

Carbon nanoparticles are particularly notable for their exceptionally
high thermal conductivity (as illustrated in Fig. 7). For instance, carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) can exhibit thermal conductivity values as high as
6600 W/mK [147,174], while the in-plane thermal conductivity of
graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) can reach 3000 W/mK [175,174]. These
values highlight the remarkable thermal transport properties of carbon
nanoparticles, which are closely linked to the thermal conductivity
characteristic of an individual graphene monolayer.

4.1.1. Underlying mechanisms of thermal conductivity enhancement

The enhancement of thermal conductivity in base fuels through the
introduction of carbon nanoparticles is governed by a multifaceted
interplay of mechanisms, offering valuable insights into the behavior of
CNFs. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized into Static and
Dynamic mechanisms, each contributing uniquely to the observed
thermal conductivity enhancement [177–183].

Static mechanisms:

• Nanolayer Mechanism: The nanolayer can be conceived as a solid-
like structure that forms at the interface between base liquid mole-
cules and nanoparticles [181,182,184,185,186]. Within this nano-
layer, liquid molecules exhibit greater ordering compared to the bulk
liquid. This enhanced ordering can act as a thermal bridge between
nanoparticles and the liquid, thereby enhancing thermal conductiv-
ity within the nanofluid. However, while nanolayers play a role in
heat transport, they are unlikely to be the sole drivers of thermal
conductivity enhancement, as the required layer thickness for sub-
stantial enhancement exceeds (by one order) the observed layer
thickness from numerical simulations and experiments [94,187].
• Aggregation Mechanism: Aggregation of nanoparticles, driven by
continuous collisions and van der Waals forces, is an intrinsic char-
acteristic of nanofluids. These aggregated particles can form clusters,
leading to interconnected structures that enable rapid heat conduc-
tion through the network and the liquid phase [188]. However, the
enhancement of thermal conductivity can be offset by imperfect
contact at particle-particle or particle-cluster interfaces, introducing
interfacial thermal resistance (known as Kapitza resistance) [183,
187,185,186]. A key factor influencing thermal conductivity in
nanofluids is the high aspect ratio network of fractal-like aggregates,
which promotes efficient heat flow over long distances [187,186].
However, these high aspect ratio structures also tend to have high
interfacial thermal resistance with fluids and solids, which can limit
thermal conductivity improvement. In denser nanofluids, clustering
becomes more significant due to van der Waals attraction, leading to
increased agglomeration [187,186]. Over time, larger clusters may
settle, resulting in a physical particle volume smaller than the clus-
ter’s effective volume. This aggregation mechanism introduces a
non-linear effect on thermal conductivity enhancement, making it a
significant factor in the behavior of nanofluids.

Dynamic Mechanism:

• Brownian Motion and Micro-Convection: The random Brownian
motion of nanoparticles within the liquid phase is an inherent
property of nanofluids, and in reality, nanoparticles are not

stationary. Consequently, the effects of Brownian motion and micro-
convection constitute major mechanisms for thermal conductivity
enhancement in nanofluids [180,187,189]. However, some studies
have reported contradictory findings regarding the impact of Brow-
nian motion [180,187,189]. An important consideration is the time
scale analysis of thermal diffusivity, measuring the rate of heat flow
via thermal conduction compared to nanoparticle diffusivity, which
quantifies the rate of mass motion due to nanoparticle diffusion [180,
187,189]. In certain cases, the time scales reveal orders of magnitude
differences,
possible
micro-convection effects may be negligible [188]. Nevertheless,
Brownian motion can influence the particle clustering and aggrega-
tion mechanisms, ultimately contributing to enhanced thermal
conductivity.

4.1.2. Analytical expressions for thermal conductivity of CNFs

Understanding the changes in thermal conductivity of base fluids
when carbon nanoparticles are introduced involves the consideration of
various analytical expressions, each addressing specific mechanisms.
These models can be broadly categorized into five key groups, based on
assumptions related to particle motion, which are static and dynamic
models [177–183,187]. Here is a brief discussion on the key models for
the five groups, focusing on those that are important and relatively
straightforward to use, as extensive reviews are available [188,190].

Effective medium theory (EMT)-based models: The effective
medium theory (EMT) based models are static models that assume
motionless particles and diffusive heat transfer in both the continuous
phase (liquid) and dispersed phase (nanoparticles) [191,188,190].
While they can provide good predictions for micro- or millimeter-sized
solid particles, they often yield inaccurate thermal conductivity values
for nanofluids. This is because these models assume only thermal
diffusion as the heat conduction mechanism and do not fully incorporate
the unique thermal transport characteristics of nanofluids [191,188].

“Maxwell model” and “Maxwell–Garnett model” is the first and one
of the most used EMT-based models to predict the effective thermal
conductivity of nanofluids (Keff ) for a dilute solid–liquid mixture (fv ≤
0.01) of non-interacting spherical particles [163,190]. The Maxwell
model is given below:

Keff = Kbf ⋅

Here, Keff = effective thermal conductivity of nanofluid, Knp = thermal
conductivity of nanoparticles, Kbf = thermal conductivity of the base
fuel, fV = volume fraction of the nanoparticles.

Bruggeman Model is an EMT-based model that considers interactions
among randomly distributed solid particles in a binary solid–liquid
mixture of homogeneous spherical particles [190]. It can be expressed
as:

At low nanoparticle concentration (fv ≤ 0.01), Bruggeman model and
Maxwell model show identical behavior, however the differences be-
tween the models increase with the increase of particle concentration.
Hamilton-Crosser Model incorporates particle shape effects on Keff
and modifies the Maxwell model by introducing an empirical shape
factor (n) and sphericity of the particles (Ψ). For specific conditions,

Nanoscale layer-based models: According to nanoscale layer the-
ory, an intermediate solid-like liquid layer is formed at the interface of
solid particles and base fluid with complex interface electrostatic effect
which acts as thermal bridge between solid phase and liquid phase
[190]. One of the first models considering nanoscale layer to predict
effective thermal conductivity of nanofluid was proposed by Yu and
Choi [185]. The proposed model used modified thermal conductivity
(Knpe) of nanoparticle which is given below:

Knpe = Knp⋅

[

(cid:0) (1 (cid:0) γ) + (1 + β)3⋅(1 + 2γ)

⋅γ

(9)

Here, γ = the ratio of nanolayer thermal conductivity to particle thermal
conductivity and β = the ratio of the nanolayer thickness to the original
particle radius. With the modified thermal conductivity (Knpe) of nano-
particles, the Maxwell model can be expressed as:

Keff = Kbf ⋅

(cid:0)
Knpe + 2⋅Kbf + 2⋅

Knpe + 2⋅Kbf (cid:0)

⋅(1 (cid:0) β)3⋅fV

)

(10)

Equation (10) signifies a small nanolayer will have strong effect on Keff if
the particle size is small. The effect of non-spherical particles was also
introduced by modifying the Hamilton–Crosser model [182].

Brownian motion and micro-Convection-based models: Brow-
nian motion-based models considered the random motion of particles in
the liquid phase which is a dynamic mechanism that can enhance the
effective thermal conductivity of nanofluids through either collisions of
the particles or the micro convection of the fluid induced by individual
nanoparticles [190].

Jang and Choi proposed a theoretical expression considering
different energy transport modes in nanofluids [192]. Considered en-
ergy transport modes were collision between base fluid molecules,
thermal diffusion in nanoparticles, collision among nanoparticles by
translational motion due to the Brownian motion with long wavelength,
and Brownian motion of nanoparticles with short wavelength. The

aggregation which depends on aggregation cluster morphology, filler
thermal conductivity and interfacial thermal resistance [185,190].

Models-based on other mechanism: Considering different modes
of heat transfer mechanism, researchers proposed different models to
predict and describe the magnitude and characteristics of nanofluid’s
effective thermal conductivity (Keff ) [295]. Models are also available
which consider the effect of geometric structure and size of nano-
particles [189], and geometric and physical anisotropy [191].

4.1.3. Critical factors and trends identified in experimental studies

Optimizing the performance of CNFs in various applications requires
a thorough understanding of the factors influencing their thermal con-
ductivity enhancement. This section examines the key factors impacting
CNF thermal conductivity, such as nanoparticle concentration, type,
size, the properties of the base liquid, and ambient temperature.

Nanoparticles concentration/solid volume fraction is one of the most
important factors affecting the thermal conductivity of nanofluid. Most
of the experimental findings concluded with good agreement that
thermal conductivity typically enhances with increasing particle con-
centration (up to 5.00 % w/w) [178,192,191]. This enhancement can be
attributed to the formation of a network of clustered structures due to
nanoparticle aggregation, which acts as a dominant mechanism for
thermal conductivity enhancement. However, beyond a certain
threshold, large clusters may become unstable, leading to increased
interfacial thermal resistance and a subsequent decrease in thermal
conductivity. In addition, particle type, size and shape can also affect the
extent of thermal conductivity changes of nanofluids [178,192,191].
Nanoparticles with higher thermal conductivity will always yield high
thermal conductivity nanofluid [181,190,192]. Nanoparticles morpho-
logy/shape influences the thermal contact between particles and nano-
layer characteristics which dictate the interfacial resistance and thermal
resistance [178,192,191]. Smaller particles increase the effective sur-
face area, thickens the interfacial layering, and enhances the Brownian
motion [178,192,191]. In contrast, small particles are more prone to
intense aggregation particularly at high particle concentration which
might result in decrease in thermal conductivity [178,192,191]. Thus,
thermal conductivity enhancement of nanofluid also depends on particle
size.

Fig. 8a shows the thermal conductivity changes with increasing
particle concentration (0.00–3.00 % w/w) for three different types of
carbon-based nanoparticles
(CNPs-spherical, MWCNTs-cylindrical,
GNPs-sheet type) with Jet-A as base fuel [162]. Particle size and spe-
cific surface area (SSA) order were (CNP > GNP > MWCNT)particle-size
and (MWCNT > CNP > GNP)SSA respectively. All the nanoparticles
showed a general
increasing trend in thermal conductivity with
increasing particle concentration up to 2.00 % w/w. Beyond 2.00 %
w/w, CNP based CNF’s thermal conductivity started to decrease while
MWCNT based CNF’s thermal conductivity further increased and GNP
based CNF’s showed non-linear trend. MWCNT has the highest thermal
conductivity and SSA with lowest particle size followed by CNP.
MWCNT based CNFs showed highest enhancement in thermal conduc-
tivity followed by CNP based CNFs signifying that the cylindrical shape
(rod-shaped) nanoparticles possess higher
conductivity
enhancement compared to spherical shape nanoparticles due to larger
surface area and rapid heat transport along relatively long distances
(through clustering) due to the greater length, usually of the order of
micrometers. Particle concentration wise, spherical shape CNP based
CNFs showed better enhancement in thermal conductivity below 2.00 %
w/w particle concentration. Beyond, 2.00 % w/w particle concentra-
tion, CNP might form unstable clusters with dominant thermal resis-
tance effect decreasing the thermal conductivity. GNP based CNF’s
nonlinear trends can be ascribed to significantly low bulk density and
sheet type morphology,
intensifying the aggregation process, and
negatively affecting the heat transport process. Thermal conductivity
trends of different GrNPL (different sphericity) based CNFs with
n-decane as base fuel concluded that increasing particle concentration
increased thermal conductivity while decreasing sphericity increased

thermal

thermal conductivity for a specific particle concentration (see Fig. 8b)
indicating again non-spherical particle having higher SSA is much more
effective in enhancing thermal conductivity of CNFs [164]. Enhance-
ment in thermal conductivity with increasing particle concentration had
been reported for MWCNTs (0.00–3.00 % w/w)/Water nanofluid where
higher enhancement in thermal conductivity was observed for 3.00 %
w/w particle concentration [188]. Also, the enhancement in thermal
conductivity increases with MWCNT’s length for a specific particle size.
Long MWCNT (higher SSA) was much more effective in enhancing
thermal conductivity compared to shorter ones. Fig. 8c shows the rela-
tion of SSA and particle concentration on thermal conductivity trend of
GNP/Kerosene based CNFs [112]. Enhancement of thermal conductivity
with increasing SSA of particle and the dependency of the extent of
enhancement on particle concentration were reported. Particle con-
centration was much more significant compared to SSA on thermal
conductivity enhancement.

◦

Thermal conductivity of nanofluid strongly depends on the ambient
temperature as thermal conductivities of base liquid and nanoparticles
are also a strong function of temperature [178,192,191]. Fig. 8d shows
the changes in thermal conductivity of GNP/Kerosene CNFs with
different temperature (20–70
C) at different particle concentrations
(0.005, 0.050, 0.200 % w/w) and different SSA (300, 500, 750 m2/g)
[112]. CNF’s thermal conductivity increased with increasing tempera-
ture. Thermal conductivity enhancement of water (base liquid) with
different surface modified MWCNTs (surfactant, acid, base, amide, sul-
fate) was reported with increasing temperature (10–60
C) [196]. On the
contrary, opposing results were also reported where carbon-based
nanoparticles did not affect the enhancement of thermal conductivity
of base liquid with increasing ambient temperature. GrNP/EG (Ethylene
glycol) based nanofluids thermal conductivity trends at different parti-
cle concentration (0.03, 0.20, 0.40 % v/v) with different ambient tem-
perature (25–65
C) concluded that enhancing ambient temperature
does not change the thermal conductivity significantly [156]. In another

The base fuel’s thermo-physical properties and the dispersion sta-
bility of the nanoparticles on the base fuel also influence the degree of
thermal conductivity enhancement. Typically, a base fuel with a higher
thermal conductivity leads to CNF with a lower thermal conductivity
increment [156,178,192,191]. The interaction between base fuel and
nanoparticles is crucial for thermal conductivity enhancements [197,

The dispersion quality of nanoparticles on the base liquid is also a
critical factor for the enhancement of thermal conductivity of nano-
fluids. Surface modification of nanoparticles can influence the stability

face modified MWCNTs (surfactant, acid, base, amide, sulfate-modified)

Enhancing the thermal conductivity of carbon nanoparticle-based
nanofluids (CNFs) or nanofuels involves several key factors. The
choice of carbon nanoparticles (cNPs) must consider their thermal
conductivity, size, shape, and stability in the base liquid. While
increasing cNP concentration generally improves thermal conductivity,
it must be optimized to maintain stability. Most thermal conductivity
experiments on CNFs are conducted at low temperatures (<100
C),
whereas engine-relevant conditions involve much higher temperatures.
Consequently, understanding thermal conductivity trends under these
for optimizing CNF formulations for high-
conditions is crucial

4.2. Effect of thermal radiation absorption

Thermal radiation absorption by CNF droplets from a flame signifi-
cantly affects combustion characteristics, particularly the burning rate.
This interaction has led to extensive research focused on understanding
how cNPs influence the optical properties of the base liquid. These in-
vestigations are driven by the potential applications of nanofluids,
especially when carbon nanoparticles are used as working fluids in
direct solar thermal absorption collectors [147].

Researchers have utilized various theoretical models to thoroughly
investigate the optical properties of carbon nanoparticle-based nano-
fluids, with a particular focus on thermal radiation absorption. Among the
most utilized models are the Lambert–Beer approach, Rayleigh scattering
approach, Maxwell–Garnett theory, Mie scattering theory, and the
discrete dipole approximation [147,199–207]. These models consider a
multitude of parameters, including interparticle distance, particle shape,
material composition, size, concentration, the depth at which incoming

radiation penetrates the nanofluid, wavelength-dependent radiation ab-
sorption, transmission spectra of the nanofluid, scattering and absorption
efficiency, extinction coefficient, and properties of the base liquid. These
models are essential for quantifying the thermal radiation energy absor-
bed or scattered by the nanofluid. They also offer insights into how the
morphological characteristics and thermophysical properties of cNPs
impact thermal radiation absorption. Alongside theoretical models, re-
searchers have conducted extensive experimental studies, carefully
correlating their findings with model predictions [204,208–214]. These
studies have utilized nanoparticles such as Multi Walled Carbon Nano-
tubes (MWCNTs), Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs), Graphene
Oxide (GO), Graphite/Nanodiamond, Single Walled Carbon Nanohorns
(SWCNHs), and Carbon Nanoballs (CNBs). The base liquids for these ex-
periments included water and ethylene glycol (EG), with nanoparticle
concentrations ranging from 0.0001 % to 0.1000 % w/w.

Understanding radiative heat transfer during droplet combustion is
complex, as both the base fuel and nanoparticles absorb thermal radi-
ation differently [159,215]. This difference creates intricate tempera-
ture gradients between the solid particles and the liquid phase.

nanofuels with MWCNTs [159]. Reprinted with permission from Ref. [159]. Copyright 2012 American Chemical Society.

Additionally, scattering from nanoparticle surfaces plays a crucial role,
influenced by factors such as particle size, morphology, and concen-
tration, which determine whether Rayleigh or Mie scattering occurs, as
well as whether scattering is dependent or independent, and single or
multiple [159,215]. Small droplets, typically under 100 μm in size,
found in sprays, possess distinct optical properties compared to bulk
liquids. These properties significantly influence how cNPs affect thermal
radiation absorption and combustion dynamics. Due to their small size
and higher surface area-to-volume ratio, these droplets interact with
thermal radiation in ways that differ from larger droplets [216,159,
215]. The presence of cNPs amplifies these differences in droplet
behavior, leading to unique radiation absorption and scattering char-
acteristics. Recognizing these distinct optical characteristics is crucial
when analyzing thermal radiation absorption and combustion phe-
nomena in small droplets.

In CNF droplet combustion and evaporation studies, models like the
Lambert–Beer approach, Rayleigh scattering approach, and Mie scat-
tering theory have been utilized to correlate theoretical predictions with
experimental observations [159,215]. These models provide essential
insights into the underlying mechanisms and the influence of radiation
absorption on both burning and evaporation characteristics. Parameters
considered include interparticle distance, particle material, size, shape,
droplet geometry, transmission spectra of the nanofluid, and the
wavelength of incoming radiation. This source of incoming radiation
could either be an external source or originate from the flame itself [159,
215].

Gan et al. [159] explored the radiation absorption characteristics in
the UV–visible range and examined their effects on droplet evaporation.
They conducted experiments employing cNPs (MWCNTs and CNPs) and
mNPs (nano Al) in combination with ethanol as the base fuel. An
external heat source, a mercury lamp emitting UV and visible radiation,
was utilized. By analyzing the extinction coefficients of the nanofluids
and comparing them to experimentally measured transmission spectra,
they successfully modeled the optical characteristics using the Rayleigh
approximation. The experimental findings (see Fig. 9a–d) clearly
demonstrate a significant increase in both the evaporation rate and
droplet temperature for NFs when compared to the base fuel, with
MWCNTs outperforming other nanoparticles such as Al and CNPs.
Additionally, a direct correlation was observed between the increase in
incident radiation energy and the evaporation rate, attributed to
enhanced heat transfer through improved radiation absorption and heat
conduction within the droplet. NFs generally exhibited lower trans-
mittance, indicating better absorption compared to the base fuel (refer

to Fig. 9c). Notably, cNPs showed a wavelength-dependent character-
istic in radiation absorption (Fig. 9d). Although Al/ethanol NFs had the
lowest transmission, the highest increase in evaporation rate was
observed for MWCNTs/ethanol NFs. This difference was primarily
attributed to the greater contribution to the absorbed energy by
MWCNTs compared to Al nanoparticles, as well as the superior thermal
conductivity enhancement capability of MWCNTs relative to Al nano-
particles. This distinction was further supported by modeling the optical
properties using the Rayleigh approximation, which confirmed that
MWCNT-based NFs were more efficient at absorbing incident radiation
(Fig. 10a and b). The higher absorption efficiency and better heat con-
duction properties of MWCNTs result in more effective energy utiliza-
tion,
leading to a higher evaporation rate and increased droplet
temperature in MWCNTs-based NFs. It is important to note that the
modeling assumed a spherical shape for all particles, thus not account-
ing for the non-linear optical properties of MWCNTs. However.

more advanced models like the Discrete Dipole Approximation
(DDA) and the Maxwell–Garnett approximation can overcome this
limitation, providing a more accurate representation of MWCNTs’
unique characteristics. These models Effectively represent the optical
properties of particles with various shapes, including spheroids, cylin-
ders, and more complex geometries, even periodic structures [147].
While the UV–visible range has been studied for radiation absorption,
the dominant thermal radiation during combustion falls primarily in the
infrared (IR) range. To evaluate radiation absorption in the IR spectrum,
Tanvir et al. [215] investigated how radiation absorption across the
visible and IR ranges (0.19 μm–4.30 μm) affects the burning rate of
graphene nanoplatelet (GrNP)/ethanol NFs. They also examined the
influence of particle size and droplet size. A model based on Mie scat-
tering approximation and Monte Carlo simulation was developed to
estimate radiation retention (volumetric absorptivity) by CNF droplets,
the spatial distribution of absorbed radiation by particles, and radiation
absorption sensitivity to particle size, droplet size, and incident radia-
tion wavelength. The addition of GrNP generally increased the burning
rate of the base fuel, with further enhancement observed at higher
particle concentrations (refer Fig. 11a). Interestingly, droplet size had a
negligible impact on burning rate, except for a slight increase with larger
droplets. Smaller particles, on the other hand, facilitated a greater in-
crease in burning rate at a specific particle concentration. The Mie
scattering theory approximation was employed to model the optical
properties (absorption coefficient and absorptivity) of CNFs, considering
both particles and base fuel, across a wavelength range of 0.19 μm–4.30
μm. Mie scattering theory was chosen because it provides accurate

results when the shape factor approaches unity where Rayleigh
approximation becomes invalid, which was the case for the CNFs. With
increasing particle concentration, the absorption coefficient of CNFs
increased across all particle sizes and wavelengths (see Fig. 11b and c).
Notably, for lower wavelengths, the absorption coefficient increased as
particle size decreased, owing to the higher number of particles avail-
able to absorb radiation at the same particle concentration. However, in
higher wavelength regions, specifically in the IR region, particle size had
no significant effect on the absorption coefficient. Volumetric absorp-
tivity increased with rising particle concentration, reaching a maximum

saturated value at very low concentrations of nanoparticles. This in-
dicates that only a low concentration of nanoparticles in base fuels is
needed to absorb all incident radiation from the flame (Fig. 11d).
Furthermore, when comparing droplet sizes, larger droplets exhibited
higher absorptivity than smaller ones due to increased penetration depth
of the fuel, reducing transmission and increasing absorption (see
Fig. 11e and f). To gain insights into the spatial distribution of absorbed
radiation, a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted, tracking photon
penetration into CNF droplets at varying particle concentrations [215].
The study considered two major radiation bands emitted from the

μm (CO2). The simulation results, illustrated in Fig. 12, show the final
locations of absorbed photons within the CNF droplet. The scattered dots
represent the locations of individual photons when absorbed by the
droplet (refer Fig. 12a–d). With increasing nanoparticle concentration,
the penetration depth of photons decreased, indicating that radiation
would be absorbed closer to the droplet surface (see Fig. 12e and f). This
decrease in penetration depth was due to the increased absorption co-
efficient, which reduced scattering probability. Additionally, photons
with longer wavelengths (in the IR region) penetrated more deeply than
those with shorter wavelengths at the same particle concentration. This
trend aligns with the observed changes in absorption coefficients and
highlights the wavelength-dependent nature of radiation absorption in
CNFs. Of significant importance is the realization that radiation ab-
sorption near the droplet’s surface could.

potentially generate localized hotspots, ultimately leading to local-
ized boiling of the base fuel. These localized hotspots might also initiate
nucleation boiling, forming vapor bubbles within the droplet and
contributing to puffing or micro-explosion events. Although there is
currently no specific experimental study demonstrating the onset of
localized boiling and bubble formation during CNF droplet combustion,
the presence of vapor bubbles, particularly at the droplet surface, im-
plies the existence of localized hotspots. Experimental evidence from the
study of cerium oxide/n-dodecane nanofuel droplets’ evaporation in a
contactless environment (acoustic levitation) under external radiative
heating has indicated that nanoparticle or its aggregates can serve as
local hotspots and nucleation sites, leading to bubble formation within
the droplet (see Fig. 13) [216]. Both localized boiling and vapor bubble
formation play crucial roles in the liquid fuel vaporization process, can
result in enhancing the burning rate. The enhancement in the burning
rate is the result of a combined effect of thermal radiation absorption
near the droplet surface and the efficient distribution of absorbed energy
due to improved heat conduction facilitated by the presence of cNPs.
cNPs can enhance the thermal conductivity of the base fuel, allowing for
better heat transfer throughout the fuel, while the absorbed thermal
radiation near the surface further accelerates the combustion process,
leading to a more efficient and rapid burn. The burning rate can be
further enhanced through the onset of localized boiling and vapor
bubble
or
micro-explosions. These phenomena provide an additional mechanism
for transferring fuel mass into the flame region via satellite or child
droplets. The rapid vaporization and ejection of these smaller droplets
increase the surface area exposed to the flame, thereby accelerating the
combustion process and contributing to a higher overall burning rate.
Radiation absorbance or transmission spectra, particularly in the
infrared (IR) range, can offer valuable insights into how radiation ab-
sorption influences the burning process, specifically affecting the
burning rate. These spectra allow for a comparison of different nano-
particles in terms of their efficiency in absorbing radiation. When
combined with thermal conductivity trends, these data can help deter-
mine which nanoparticles are most effective at enhancing the burning
rate.

4.3. Mechanism and effect of particle aggregation

4.3.1. Mechanism of particle aggregation

Particle aggregation within CNF droplets during combustion repre-
sents a crtiical factor influencing the intricate processes of combustion
and vaporization. To fully understand these phenomena, it is important
to explore the mechanisms behind particle aggregation and their sub-
sequent effects. The formation of aggregates during the course of com-
bustion and evaporation is contingent upon a multitude of factors. These
factors include the dynamic, time-dependent spatial distribution of
particles within CNF droplets, the characteristics of particles in terms of
their morphology and size, the concentration of particles within the
droplet, the collision frequency of particles, the efficiency of particle and
aggregate collisions, the presence of surfactants, the occurrence of
disruptive burning behaviors such as puffing and micro-explosions, and
the inherent transport mechanisms operative within the droplet.

A primary mechanism governing agglomerate formation is the result
of interparticle collisions followed by the adhesion of colliding particles.
The efficiency of these processes is closely linked to the collision char-
acteristics of particles, including collision frequency [217,218]. The
motion of particles within CNF droplets can be analyzed by examining
the contributions of various primary transport mechanisms. Brownian
diffusion, or “Perikinetic collision,” arises from the random, stochastic
motion of particles and significantly contributes to aggregation, espe-
cially for smaller particles. Fluid-induced motion, also called “Orthoki-
netic Collision”, leads to particle collisions, with a more pronounced
effect on larger particles and pre-existing aggregates. Fig. 14a presents
the schematic representation and patterns of various fluid-induced
motions. The inward arrows on the droplet surface indicate the direc-
tion of droplet regression [217]. The mechanisms governing fluid mo-
tion include internal circulation, which can be driven by forced
convection at high Reynolds and Grashoff numbers, or by natural con-
vection resulting from velocity differences between nanofuel droplets
and the surrounding gases [219,220]. The presence of complex internal
circulation can also be attributed to various Marangoni effects, both
thermal and solutal in nature [211]. Additionally, during the combus-
tion of nanofuel droplets, a net convective flow pattern is typically
observed. This pattern arises from the outward flow of liquid phases,
moving from the droplet’s center to its surface due to the decreasing
droplet size, as well as the inward flow of particles influenced by the
surface tension gradient [217]. However, it is important to note that the
rate of outward diffusion of the liquid is generally two orders of
magnitude lower than the rate of droplet surface regression [173]. In
addition, transport of particles during vapor-bubble formation occurs

The interaction between cNPs and thermal radiation absorption in
small droplets plays a crucial role in combustion dynamics. Both theo-
retical models and experimental studies indicate that these nano-
particles significantly enhance radiation absorption, especially in the
infrared (IR) range. This is important because IR radiation corresponds
to the primary thermal radiation emitted during combustion. The ab-
sorption of IR radiation by cNPs increases with higher nanoparticle
concentrations and smaller particle sizes, which can lead to the forma-
tion of localized hotspots and vapor bubbles. When combined with the
efficient heat conduction provided by cNPs, these effects can result in
faster combustion rates. However, despite the importance of IR ab-
sorption in the combustion of CNFs, limited research has been con-
ducted in this area. This highlights the need for further studies to better
understand and optimize these effects.

puffing/micro-explosions) near the droplet’s surface or within the
droplet itself. This process induces oscillating motion in the nanofuel
droplet, causing the liquid to repetitively expand and contract. During
liquid expansion through bubble formation and merging, nearby parti-
cles are pushed outward, while during the liquid contraction phase
(bubble rupture), the droplet contracts, pushing particles toward its
center. These dynamic situations potentially enhance the rate of particle
aggregation [217,218]. Differential setting mechanism becomes prom-
inent when the nanofuel contains larger, denser particles compared to
the base fuel. Larger and denser particles settle first, and smaller parti-
cles may accompany them as they descend [217,218].

To evaluate the relative significance of these transport mechanisms,
Gan et al. [217] reported a straightforward model for comparative
analysis. The model assessed the effects of different transport mecha-
nisms on particle collision rates and their respective contributions.
Specifically, the study considered collisions between fixed-size particles
(80 nm) and variable-size particles (ranging from 1 nm to 1000 nm). The
analysis results, shown in Fig. 14b, clearly demonstrated that perikinetic
collision, primarily driven by Brownian diffusion, is the dominant
mechanism governing particle aggregation within nanofuel droplets
during combustion. This dominance becomes more pronounced as par-
ticle size decreases. Conversely, as particle size increases, both peri-
kinetic aggregation and orthokinetic aggregation, driven by surface
regression, become equally significant. Notably, in the presence of
forced convection, orthokinetic aggregation due to internal circulation
can significantly impact particle aggregation dynamics. Understanding
these various particle transport mechanisms in burning droplets pro-
vides crucial insights into how particle aggregation affects CNF droplet
combustion.

4.3.2. Time scale analysis of particle aggregation

Understanding particle aggregation dynamics in CNF droplets during
combustion is key to comprehending combustion processes. At low
particle concentrations, aggregation has little effect on combustion.
However, at higher concentrations, it can form a shell around the
droplet, which slows down evaporation and combustion. Aggregation
can also cause localized heating, vapor bubble formation, puffing, and
micro-explosions. In ideal conditions, particles in CNF droplets should
forming porous and uniform aggregates.
be evenly distributed,
Achieving this requires the particles to diffuse quickly compared to the

formation of a thin, impermeable shell structure often seen in slurry fuel
droplet combustion. To evaluate the importance of this distribution, it is
essential to compare the time scales of droplet regression with particle
migration. Particle migration time (τParticle) relative to the evaporation or
combustion period (τd) of a CNF droplet can be used to describe the
aggregation behavior of particles during burning or evaporation [215,
221,222]. This relationship is quantified through the dimensionless
number, CR.

A high value of CR indicates that particles can migrate to the drop-

particle redistribution within the droplet. Conversely, a low CR signifies

that the droplet regression rate exceeds particle migration, resulting in a
higher concentration of particles near the droplet surface. Fig. 15 il-
lustrates the variation of CR as a function of particle concentration for
two different particle sizes (50 nm and 100 nm) and droplet sizes (200
μm and 410 μm) [215]. For a specific particle size, the CR decreased with
increasing particle concentration, indicating that reduced interparticle
distances facilitate more frequent collisions and aggregation. In such
cases, particle migration dominates over
regression, promoting
micro-convection and enhanced heat transfer throughout the droplet. It
is important to note that these mechanisms can have contrasting effects
on burning and evaporation rates. While they may enhance burning/e-
vaporation rates due to improved heat transfer, they can also lead to the
formation of larger aggregates decreasing the probability of particle
combustion. Additionally, when comparing different particle sizes, CR
increased with larger particle sizes for a fixed concentration. This in-
crease was attributed to the lower number of particles in the droplet for
larger particles, resulting in larger interparticle distances. Furthermore,
with the same particle size and concentration, an increase in droplet size
led to a slight decrease in CR. This is because fewer particles are present
per droplet volume.

Another crucial dimensionless number for analyzing the effect of
particle aggregation is the Peclet number (Pe). It relates burning or
evaporation rate (K) to the diffusion coefficient (Dp) of particles in the
CNF droplet [223,224].

Pe = K
8Dp

(18)

If Pe ≪ 1, particles have ample time to diffuse and redistribute within the
droplet, resulting in a densely packed spherical aggregate. Conversely, If
Pe ≫ 1, particles accumulate near the droplet surface and are unable to
diffuse and redistribute, forming hollow spherical aggregates (refer
Fig. 16). In other words, the Pe number explains whether mass diffusion
of liquid fuel or migration of particles through convection is significant.
The Pe number describes a similar effect as CR, although the Pe number
allows the straightforward use of the burning rate or evaporation rate

from the experiments and can illustrate the effects of instantaneous
burning rate or evaporation rate to identify in which stage of the com-
bustion process aggregation occurs more frequently.

4.3.3. Observations from experiments

Obtaining experimental insights into the transient aggregation pro-
cesses occurring within burning or evaporating CNF droplets poses
significant challenges due to the spatial-temporal limitations of avail-
able imaging techniques. Researchers often rely on changes in instan-
taneous burning or evaporation rates as key indicators of the onset of
aggregation effects. This is typically accompanied by visual evidence of
particle agglomeration inside the droplet. Additionally, time scale
analysis related to aggregation can be applied using data on instanta-
neous burning or evaporation rates. Furthermore, the examination of
particles that remain as residue at the end of evaporation or combustion
can provide insights on the spatial distribution of particles and aggre-
gates within the droplets.

Based on the CR values from Fig. 15, it becomes evident that, when
CR <1, particles migrated more rapidly to the droplet’s surface
compared to the rate of droplet regression [215]. Consequently, at lower
transfer
particle concentrations, particle migration enhanced heat
characteristics within the droplet, resulting in increased evaporation or
combustion rates. This observation aligned with the higher burning rate
enhancement seen in 50 nm particles (CR <1) compared to 100 nm
particles (CR > 1), as shown in Fig. 11a [215]. The author emphasized
the significance of aggregation during combustion by highlighting that
the collected burned aggregates, with sizes of approximately 5 μm, were
still roughly 10 times larger than the original particles (50–100 nm).
This highlights the significant influence of particle aggregation on the
combustion process. Similar findings were reported by Li et al. [164],
who investigated the evaporation characteristics of GrNPL (Graphene
nanoplatelets) in n-decane. The study revealed that at a particle con-
centration of 0.10 % w/w, the particle migration time (τParticle) was
approximately 6.40 ms. However, at a higher concentration of 4.00 %
w/w, τParticle reduced significantly to around 0.60 ms. Importantly,
across a particle concentration range of 0.10–4.00 % w/w,
the

23

A.S.M.S. Parveg and A. Ratner

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101198

magnitude of particle migration time was consistently two orders of
magnitude smaller than the evaporation time. As a result, increasing the
concentration of GrNPL led to heightened particle aggregation, resulting
in decreased evaporation rates. This trend was further supported by the
evaporation rate data, as illustrated in Fig. 17 [223]. From Fig. 17, the Pe
number was higher than unity for all CNFs, signifying that the particles
were not able to redistribute inside the droplet. Furthermore, particle
aggregation accelerated at the end of the evaporation period as the Pe
number decreased for a specific particle concentration. A higher Pe
number for higher particle concentration signified that the migration of
particles was much harder at higher concentrations. At a specific particle
concentration, the effective evaporation area ratio (σ) decreased with
time, signifying particle accumulation near droplet surface or near
gas-liquid interface. The area ratio (σ) in the context of nanofuel drop-
lets was defined as the ratio of the effective surface area available for
evaporation (which excludes the area covered by nanoparticles) to the
total geometric surface area of the droplet. Additionally, the area ratio
(σ) decreased faster with time at higher particle concentrations, signi-
fying increased aggregation at higher particle loading. The decrease in
instantaneous evaporation rate trends also supported that aggregation
decreased the effective evaporation area (refer Fig. 17).

In addition, morphology and spatial distribution of the formed ag-
gregates will dictate the disruptive burning behavior (puffing and micro-
explosion). Morphological characteristics of the aggregates at the end of
the combustion process can reveal information on how these aggregates
affect the CNF droplet combustion process, the mechanism of these
aggregates’ formation, and their spatial distribution inside the droplet.
Fig. 18a–f provides a visual comparison of aggregates collected from
evaporation and droplet combustion experiments [161]. Notably, ag-
gregates from CNPs (Carbon Nanoparticles) and MWCNTs (Multi--
Walled Carbon Nanotubes) based CNFs appeared closely packed,
whereas aggregates from GNPs (Graphene Nanoplatelets) based CNFs
were loosely packed and porous. Additionally, traces of particles were
observed on the combustion residue from MWCNTs and GNPs based
CNFs, whereas CNPs-based CNFs produced combustion residue con-
sisting of soot particles. These observations suggest that CNPs aggre-
gates experienced complete combustion, while MWCNTs and GNPs
aggregates remained unburnt.

The mechanisms of particle aggregation within CNF droplets during
combustion involve a complex interplay of factors, including collision
frequencies, transport mechanisms, and particle characteristics. Brow-
nian diffusion, fluid-induced motion, and differential settling all
contribute to particle aggregation, with their impact varying based on
particle size, concentration, and droplet size. For smaller particles,
perikinetic collisions driven by Brownian diffusion are the primary
mechanism of aggregation. Time scale analysis with dimensionless

numbers offers critical insights into these dynamics. At lower particle
concentrations, migration enhances heat transfer, leading to increased
evaporation or combustion rates. However, at higher concentrations,
aggregation tends to slow these rates due to the formation of larger
aggregates. Observations of aggregates from evaporation and combus-
tion experiments highlight the significant effects of aggregation on the
combustion process. While this section provides valuable insights into
the mechanisms and effects of particle aggregation in CNF droplets
during combustion, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations.
One limitation lies in the challenges of obtaining experimental data on
transient aggregation processes within droplets due to the spatial-
temporal constraints of available imaging techniques. Additionally,
this section addresses the mechanisms and effects of aggregation but
does not explore potential strategies for mitigating or controlling ag-
gregation, which could be an area for future research.

4.4. Catalytic activity of carbon-based nanoparticles

◦

C and 900

temperatures around or below 1000

The catalytic activity and chemical kinetics impact of carbon nano-
particles (cNPs) in liquid fuel combustion has been minimal studies for
several key reasons. The biggest is that cNPs undergo thermal decom-
position at
C [225,86,170,
226–228]. In addition, materials such as Acetylene Black, Carbon Black,
Graphene Oxide, and Carbon Nanotubes have ignition points between
400
C when in the presence of air, so the likelihood of them
remaining whole and unreacted is extremely low in many cases. Also,
their decomposition and partial oxidation products resemble many of
the fuel components that they coexist with. This makes it unlikely that
they could contribute to catalytic activity or kinetics at the high tem-
peratures and oxygenated conditions typically encountered in combus-
tion [47,56,59,86,170,226–228]. Key properties which contribute to
catalytic activity like high surface area, surface chemistry, thermal sta-
bility, and oxidation resistance all degrade under flame pre-heat and
flame zone conditions, leading to a loss of catalytic function. While cNPs
might have the potential to influence chemical kinetics and improve
ignition, promote complete combustion, and reduce emissions, little
data exists to support the occurrence of these effects in real conditions.
This belief in the limited effect of cNPs’ catalytic properties during
combustion has been, to a degree, a self-fulfilling prophecy that left a
gap in research assessing their true impact [46,59]. Existing research
often highlights improvements in combustion characteristics, such as
increased evaporation rates and faster burning, which are frequently
attributed to enhanced thermo-physical effects like heat absorption,
heat transfer, and particle aggregation dynamics, rather than catalytic or
chemical kinetic mechanisms [46,59,60].

To focus on catalytic and kinetic effects, a study has to be designed to

minimize variations in other aspects and highlight aspects that would
result from the activity of interest. One such work employed pre-
vaporized liquid fuel in air premixed flames, offering a simpler geome-
try focused on parameters such as laminar burning velocity, blowoff
velocity, standoff distance, flammability limits, and flame shape [229].
These parameters are critical for understanding how cNPs can influence
chemical kinetics in combustion. Laminar burning velocity and blowoff
velocity provides fundamental insights into fuel behavior, helping to
determine burning limits and flame stability, which are essential for
practical applications and for the development of kinetic models.
However, the amount of research in this area is still limited. Only one
study has found that examined the effects of adding Multi Walled Car-
bon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) (25–200 ppm) to pre-vaporized palm oil
biodiesel (PME)/air premixed flames [229]. This study found that the
inclusion of MWCNTs significantly reduced flame height across a range
of equivalence ratios (see Fig. 19). The reduction in flame height was
primarily due to improved fuel-air mixing through micro-explosions
during the vaporization process. These micro-explosions
led to
increased oxygen utilization, which shortened the reaction zone within
the flame. As a result, both laminar burning velocity and blowoff ve-
locity were reported to be improved. These findings suggest that the fuel

mixture, when combined with MWCNTs, reacts more efficiently, leading
to enhanced combustion characteristics, including a more stable and
faster-burning flame.

The study also highlighted the importance of standoff distance, the
height of the flame base from the nozzle rim, which plays a crucial role
in the heat transfer mechanism between the flame and the nozzle rim,
directly impacting blowoff velocity. The addition of MWCNTs led to a
decrease in standoff distance, especially under fuel-rich conditions. This
reduction indicated improved heat transfer properties such as radiation
absorption and heat conduction, as evidenced by increased blowoff
velocity across all tested equivalence ratios (see Fig. 20b). The decrease
in standoff distance also indicated better heat transfer within the un-
burnt fuel mixture near pre heated zone, facilitating easier ignition and
extending flammability limits (see Fig. 20a). Notably, without MWCNTs,
the flame extinction limit was at φ = 1.6, but with 100 ppm of MWCNTs,
this limit extended to φ = 1.65. Enhancements in both lean and rich
flammability limits highlight the role of improved heat transfer in the
observed combustion performance. Also, the addition of MWCNTs to
fuel mixtures results in improvements in laminar burning velocity across
a wide range of equivalence ratios, particularly under stoichiometric
and fuel-rich conditions (see Fig. 21a). This observation may support the

hypothesis that MWCNTs may accelerate fuel reactions, potentially due
to their catalytic properties. However, it is crucial to consider whether
these effects were primarily due to catalysis or if enhanced heat transfer
plays a more dominant role. The strong correlation between laminar
burning velocity and blowoff velocity observed in the presence of
MWCNTs suggested that the improvements in flame stability and per-
formance might be driven more by enhanced heat transfer than by
catalytic activity. Similar trends in these parameters, particularly in
response to changes in equivalence ratios, reinforce this idea.

Additionally, the reduction in CO emissions with MWCNTs addition
was linked to more complete combustion, facilitated by better fuel-air
mixing and improved heat transfer within the flame (see Fig. 21b).
This improvement was attributed to the high surface area and thermal
conductivity of MWCNTs, which accelerate the combustion process,
leading to a higher heat release rate and mitigating energy loss, thereby
reducing CO formation. The process of CO oxidation in the preheated
zone may also be enhanced by the increased flame temperature due to
MWCNTs addition. On the other hand, the increase in NOx emissions
observed with MWCNTs addition was attributed to higher flame tem-
peratures, a direct result of the improved combustion performance (see
Fig. 21b). The findings align with the fact that higher flame tempera-
tures lead to higher laminar burning velocities, further contributing to
the formation of NOx.

The key takeaway is that while MWCNTs enhance the combustion
characteristics of PME/air premixed flames, the specific contribution of

catalytic effects remains unclear. The enhancements observed in flame
stability, burning velocity, and emission reductions could primarily
result from the improvement heat transfer properties such as radiation
absorption and heat conduction of the fuel mixture due to the presence
of MWCNTs. Therefore, the potential catalytic effects, while possible,
were not conclusively demonstrated and require more in-depth
investigation.

5. Experiments methods and artifacts

In nanofuel evaporation and combustion studies, researchers often
use the spherically symmetric diffusion-controlled model, commonly
referred to as the " d2-law of evaporation/combustion”. This model is
fundamental for investigating the combustion and evaporation behav-
iors of CNFs, particularly when quantifying parameters such as the
burning rate (Kc) and evaporation rate (Ke) [127,128,168,169–173].
The d2-law defines the burning rate (Kc) and evaporation rate (Ke) as the
rates of change of the CNF droplet’s surface area during combustion and
evaporation, respectively. This relationship is expressed through equa-
tions (19) and (20) for combustion and evaporation, respectively:

Here, ds = droplet diameter. d0 = Initial droplet diameter, λg =
thermal conductivity of the gas phase, Cp,g = specific heat of the gas
phase, ρl

It is important to note that the similarities between droplet vapor-
ization and combustion are substantial. Apart from gas-phase reactions,
the transport mechanisms within the droplet and the gasification process
at its surface are qualitatively similar in both cases. In combustion, the
droplet essentially perceives the surrounding flame as a hotter envi-
ronment at a relatively closer distance. The differentiation between the
two processes lies in the definition of the Spalding transfer number (B),
accounting for these distinctions.

For a more comprehensive assessment of CNF droplet combustion or
evaporation, researchers can approximate the burning rate constant (Kc)
and the evaporation rate constant (Ke) using the initial droplet diameter

symmetry, absence of forced and natural convection, diffusion as the
rate-controlling mechanism, constant pressure, flame-sheet combustion,
constant gas-phase transport properties, unity Lewis number, quasi-
steady gas-phase conditions, no vapor accumulation, single fuel spe-
cies, constant and uniform droplet temperature, and negligible Soret,
Dufour, and radiation effects [169–173]. The d2-law was originally
developed for single-component fuels but its applicability has been
broadened to include multicomponent fuels, emulsified fuels, and, most
notably, CNFs.

5.1. Comparison of experimental methods

This section provides a comparative analysis of two primary exper-
imental methods employed in CNF droplet evaporation and combustion
studies: the free-falling droplet technique and the suspended droplet
technique.

In the free-falling droplet

technique, sub-millimeter-sized CNF
droplets (diameter <0.50 mm) descend into a heated chamber or
through an ignition medium under gravity (see Fig. 22) [46,59].
High-speed imaging captures flame propagation and droplet changes.
This method suits small droplets but is less common due to complex
imaging and experimental constraints.

The suspended droplet technique is the most widely used approach
for studying CNF droplet combustion and evaporation. In this method,
CNF droplets, typically sub-millimeter to millimeter in size (diameter
>0.50 mm), are supported by a variety of means [46,59]. They can
either be supported at the tip of a single support medium (Fig. 23a), such
as a quartz tube, ceramic tube, or thermocouple, or positioned at the
intersection of multiple fine fibers (Fig. 23b), referred to as the
“cross-fiber technique”. This technique can be further classified based on
the support medium’s cross-sectional area, which can be either a single
support medium with a larger cross-sectional area (e.g., quartz tube) or
multiple support mediums with smaller cross-sectional areas, such as
fine silicon carbide (SiC) fibers. Ignition in the suspended droplet
technique can be initiated through various means, including heating
coil, hot surface, plasma arc, or sparking. High-speed imaging is
employed to document flame propagation and droplet diameter evolu-
tion. The relative simplicity of high-speed imaging requirements makes
the suspended droplet technique the preferred method for CNF droplet
combustion and evaporation studies within the scientific community.
While a free-falling droplet can naturally maintain its spherical sym-
metry without.

external it experiences forced convection due to the velocity differ-
ences between the droplet and the surrounding gas phase [231–236]. To
minimize this forced convection effect and maintain control over com-
bustion characteristics such as burning rate, droplet morphology, and
flame morphology, the suspended droplet techniques anchor the droplet
through a support medium [237–240]. The choice of support medium is
critical, as it should have minimal impact on the combustion and
evaporation characteristics being studied. Careful consideration of the
support medium’s properties and its impact on experimental results is
crucial.

The selection of an experimental method for CNF droplet combustion
studies hinges on a careful balance between the need for spherical
symmetry and practical constraints. While the free-falling droplet
technique offers the advantage of natural spherical symmetry, it is less
commonly employed due to complex imaging requirements and limi-
tations in conducting experiments in a flowing medium. On the other
hand, the suspended droplet technique, with its various configurations,
is the preferred method within the scientific community, primarily due
to its ease of high-speed imaging and control over experimental

5.2. Experiment artifacts

This section discusses the experimental artifacts associated with
suspended droplet methods and their impact on droplet evaporation and
combustion characteristics. By focusing on these widely used techniques
in CNF droplet studies, it establishes a foundation for exploring differ-
ences in droplet behavior in the following sections.

5.2.1. Effects of support medium type and size

Maintaining true spherical symmetry, similar to conditions in
microgravity, is inherently challenging in terrestrial environments with
unsupported droplets. Nevertheless, researchers have demonstrated that
by anchoring droplets in a support medium and optimizing the size ratio
between the droplet and the support medium, it is possible to approxi-
mate the combustion rate of unsupported droplets in microgravity, even
under normal gravity conditions. Achieving this criterion is more
feasible with fine fibers, as larger single support mediums constrain the
use of small-diameter droplets. Generally, a higher initial droplet
diameter-to-fiber diameter ratio (d0⁄dfiber)
facilitates reaching the
burning rate observed in microgravity for unsupported droplets [241].
Avedisian and Jackson [241] reported that for d0⁄dfiber > 13, the
burning rates of fiber-supported droplets, measured during the most
linear phase of droplet diameter evolution, were nearly identical to
those of free droplets. However, for smaller d0⁄dfiber ratios, the burning
rate increased, with the fractional change becoming more significant as
the ratio decreased. Remarkably, fine fibers as small as 14 μm have been
employed in CNF droplet combustion studies. However, as the droplet’s
instantaneous diameter (ds(t)) decreases during combustion, the pres-
ence of the fiber becomes increasingly influential. Thus, it is advisable to
select d0 ⁄dfiber values considering ds(t)
>13, at least the period when
quantifying burning, or evaporation rate is paramount.

dfiber

Initial droplet size introduces biases in burning rate quantification
due to the interplay of soot formation and radiative heat losses. Exten-
sive experiments with various liquid fuels have affirmed the significance
of initial droplet size in shaping the burning process [238–252]. Fig. 24
portrays the effects of initial droplet size on burning rate through scaling
analysis [144]. While consensus on specific limiting values varies, re-
searchers could not unanimously agree on the limiting value of D0ı and
D0ıı, the limited data suggest that D0ı ~1.00 mm and the upper range
(D0ıı) is probably in the range of 2.00 mm [242,253,254]. Notably, there
is a lack of CNF-specific studies to establish these limits; however, it is
reasonable to assume that similar principles would apply. This
assumption is grounded in the relatively stable thermo-physical prop-
erties employed in scaling analyses. Therefore, we recommend an initial
droplet size D0 below 1.00 mm to mitigate the complex effects of soot
formation and radiative heat loss.

The support medium has the potential to deform CNF droplet shapes,
shifting them from spherical to elliptical or non-uniform configurations
due to high surface tension forces. This deformation introduces thermal
asymmetries around the droplet, thereby influencing heat transfer
characteristics and flame structure, subsequently impacting the overall
combustion process. Among support mediums, only multiple fine fibers
can effectively sustain the spherical shape of burning or evaporating
droplets, at least for the majority of the combustion/vaporization
duration. Alternative support medium techniques may lead to pendent
droplets (single support medium) or non-uniform droplets, as seen with
thermocouples. Additionally, transient changes in droplet sphericity
provide valuable insights for identifying regions to measure burning or
evaporation rates, helping to clarify differences in reported rate trends.

5.2.2. Effects from heat conduction/transfer through the support medium
An essential aspect to consider when employing support medium
techniques is the phenomenon of heat conduction through the support

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101198

medium. The support medium can significantly impact the combustion
process through various mechanisms, including the conduction of heat
to the liquid phase, generating thermal asymmetries, serving as local-
ized nucleation sites for bubble formation, and even distorting the flame
structure [255]. Hence, it is of paramount importance to minimize heat
conduction between the support medium and the liquid fuel droplet
during combustion. For instance, when suspending a droplet on a quartz
tube or fine thermocouple, the rate of heat conduction into or from the
fuel droplet is notably faster compared to the surrounding environment.
Critical factors determining whether the support medium enhances heat
transfer to the droplet from the flame or acts as a heat sink include the
cross-sectional area, thickness, thermal conductivity, and specific heat
capacity of the support medium [256]. These effects can become more
pronounced during CNF droplet evaporation and combustion due to the
enhanced heat transfer characteristics associated with CNF. Conse-
quently, addressing these uncertainties is imperative.

A comprehensive analysis has examined the effects of heat conduc-
tion on the evaporation of n-heptane droplets, using various support
mediums ranging in size from 14 μm to 225 μm (e.g., quartz fibers), at
temperatures from room temperature to 973 K under normal gravity
conditions [257]. The selected studies utilized similar experimental
setups, where n-heptane droplets were generated and suspended at the
tip of a quartz fiber (thermal conductivity: 1.40 W/mK), then introduced
into a high-temperature furnace, exposing the droplets to a hot nitrogen
atmosphere. The furnace dimensions across these studies were consis-
tent, ensuring that liquid-phase absorption of radiation from the furnace
walls did not significantly influence the results. The primary differences
among these studies were the diameters of the droplet support fibers
and, to a lesser extent, the initial droplet sizes. The findings suggest that
the cross-fiber technique, involving two or three fine fibers with a
diameter of approximately 14 μm, or similar fiber diameters as the
support medium, does not significantly affect the heat transfer charac-
teristics into and from the droplet, consequently having no substantial
impact on the evaporation process. However, larger-diameter support
fibers can markedly enhance heat conduction and subsequently influ-
ence the evaporation rate. This relationship between support fiber size
and droplet evaporation rate has also been reported as linear (refer to
Fig. 25a) [257]. Moreover, reported equations 23–25 provide empirical
correlations illustrating the extent of the increase in the evaporation rate
concerning ambient temperature, T(K) and the support medium’s
cross-sectional area, d2

(25) express the variations of K0(T) and CDf (T) as functions of ambient
temperature T(K). The coefficients A, B, C and D in these equations are
determined through fitting experimental data. The reported values for
(cid:0) 4,
these coefficients under normal gravity condition are A = 4.1434*10
(cid:0) 2, and D = (cid:0) 7.1744. Both K0(T) and
B = (cid:0) 0.1078, C = 2.2723*10
CDf (T) exhibit a linear dependence on ambient temperature (refer to
Fig. 25b). Importantly, K0(T) closely aligns with (Kcross(cid:0) fiber(T)), indi-
cating that the cross-microfiber configuration has no substantial influ-
ence on the evaporation process.

The impact of support fiber’s thermal conductivity on fuel droplet
evaporation has also been explored in a separate study [258]. In this
investigation, three different support fibers (quartz, iron, copper) with
distinct thermal conductivities (quartz: 1.40 W/mK, iron: 80.00 W/mK,

29

A.S.M.S. Parveg and A. Ratner

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101198

copper: 400 W/mk) were employed. These fibers shared the same size,
with a diameter of 80 μm, and the fuel used was jatropha methyl ester
(JME). The experiments were conducted at four different ambient
temperatures (673K, 773K, 873K, 973K). The results revealed a linear
relationship between the support fiber’s thermal conductivity and the
enhancement of fuel droplet evaporation rate, especially at higher
ambient temperatures (refer to Fig. 25e). Furthermore, at sufficiently
high ambient temperatures, support fibers with higher thermal con-
ductivity can act as local nucleation sites for vapor bubble formation,
leading to puffing or micro-explosions. For example, Fig. 25c demon-
strates the absence of puffing or micro-explosion with different support
fibers at 873 K ambient temperature. However, when the ambient
temperature was raised to 973 K, puffing or micro-explosion was
observed for the support fiber with the highest thermal conductivity
(copper: 400 W/mk) (refer to Fig. 25d). Notably, support fibers with a
diameter greater than 0.15 mm or a thermal conductivity higher than
400 W/mK can induce micro-explosions, attributed to local boiling or
the Leidenfrost effect caused by the support fiber within the droplet.
Given that flame temperature will replace ambient temperature during
CNF droplet combustion, the influence of support fiber size and thermal
conductivity becomes even more critical, given the enhanced heat
transfer between the support fiber, nanoparticles, and the base fuel.
Furthermore, the interaction between nanoparticles and the support
medium (e.g., agglomeration on the support fiber) is likely to impact the
combustion and evaporation process, and this area merits investigation,
as no prior studies have addressed this issue.

Presently, comprehensive studies quantifying the effects of support
fiber type (single/multiple fibers, thermocouple), size, and thermal
conductivity on CNF droplet evaporation and combustion characteris-
tics are lacking. As a result, guidance for selecting the most suitable
support fiber is primarily derived from experiments conducted with pure
fuels. These studies recommend using multiple fine fibers with low
thermal conductivity and employing a cross-fiber technique to minimize
the impact of the support medium. Crossing multiple fine fibers can also
maintain the spherical droplet shape, preventing thermal asymmetries
around the burning or evaporating droplet. The size of the support fiber
is constrained by the initial droplet size, and it is recommended that the
initial droplet diameter be kept below 1.00 mm to mitigate the depen-
dence of burning rate or evaporation rate on initial droplet size and the
interplay of soot formation and radiative heat losses. Additionally,
support fiber size should comply with the condition ds(t)
>13 for at least

the period which burning rate and evaporation rate will be quantified.

5.2.3. Artifacts from data reduction approach for burning rate
measurement

Accurate measurement of combustion and evaporation rates is
essential in droplet experiments. The method used for data reduction
can introduce uncertainties, especially in determining droplet diameter
and the rates of burning and evaporation. Researchers often employ
various diameter definitions to assess the instantaneous droplet diam-
eter during burning/evaporation, including side-to-side diameter (dss),
equivalent volume of a sphere (deqvs), equivalent area of a circle (deqac),
and equivalent area of a sphere (deqas) [259]. For nearly spherical
droplets, these definitions yield consistent results, with variations below
1.50 %. However, in the case of ellipsoidal droplets, the variation can
reach up to ~5.00 % [259]. Therefore, when droplets maintain an
elliptical shape, it is advisable to use the equivalent volume of a
sphere-based definition. During instances of puffing/micro-explosions,
the equivalent area of a
which cause significant deformation,
circle-based definition becomes appropriate. Selection of the diameter
definition should align with the droplet’s shape history (e.g.: sphericity),
ensuring consistency and comparability in experimental results. Another
source of variation arises from the definition of burning rate/-
evaporation rate and the considered quantification period. In the
idealized d2-law, droplet size decreases linearly during the quasi-steady
evaporation/combustion stage, and the slope of this linear region rep-
resents the burning rate/evaporation rate. However, real fuel droplets
may deviate from this idealization due to factors like transient heating,
multicomponent distillation, micro-explosions, vapor accumulation,
and support fiber
In the presence of
micro-explosions/puffing, non-linear trends can emerge, making it un-
reasonable to quantify the slope as the burning rate/evaporation rate.
Consequently, alternative definitions are necessary. For the steady stage,
the slope can be termed the “effective burning/evaporation rate
(Kc or Ke)”, while for the unsteady stage, the “average burning rate/-
evaporation rate (Kc(cid:0) avg or Ke(cid:0) avg)” is suitable, calculated as the change
in droplet diameter square over time during this stage [43,46,59]. When
multiple distinguishable stages exist, quantifying stage-wise burning
rates/evaporation rates is more appropriate. “Overall burning rate/-
evaporation rate (Kc(cid:0) ovl or Ke(cid:0) ovl)” considers
the entire droplet’s
behavior throughout multiple stages and is defined as the ratio of the
square of

comprehensive
ration/combustion period (equation (22)). This

cilitates comparisons across different experiments.

Until now, our investigation has centered on defining the notion of
‘commercially viable CNF,’ detailing methods for CNF preparation,
analyzing stability periods, and presenting experimental results related
to their stability. Additionally, we explored key mechanisms governing
CNF droplet combustion and evaporation, focusing on thermal con-
ductivity, thermal radiation absorption and particle aggregation. We
also provided an overview of different experimental techniques for CNF
droplet studies, highlighting the impact of experimental artifacts. In the
forthcoming sections, we will present a detailed discussion on how
carbon-based nanoparticles intricately affect the dynamics of droplet
evaporation and combustion. Our discussion will include key parame-
ters, including evaporation rate, burning rate, ignition delay, total
burning time, particle burning probability, as well as puffing and micro-
explosion characteristics. These insights are derived from a synthesis of
results and observations obtained through extensive experimental
investigations.

6. Evaporation characteristics of CNF droplet

Understanding the evaporation characteristics of fuel droplets is

crucial for comprehending spray and combustion processes, which are
essential for optimizing the performance of internal combustion devices.
This understanding parallels studying combustion without considering
gas-phase reactions, where the transport mechanisms within the droplet
and the vaporization process from the droplet’s surface exhibit quali-
in
tative similarities [173]. Evaporation characteristics are crucial
determining the vaporization of liquid fuel, which directly influences
combustion behavior. Generally, the evaporation characteristics of pure
fuel droplets depend on factors such as the fuel type (single component,
miscible multicomponent, or immiscible multicomponent), boiling
point (single component), or boiling point range (multicomponent),
latent heat, mass diffusivity, ambient temperature, ambient pressure,
and droplet size [67]. For CNF droplets, additional parameters come into
play, including the type, size, and concentration of nanoparticles in the
base fuel, as well as the heat transfer characteristics of CNFs [60,67].

Researchers commonly employ classical theories such as the d2-law
of evaporation to characterize evaporation dynamics of CNF droplet,
where the evaporation rate (Ke) assumes central importance [173]. The
evaporation process of pure fuel can be conceptually divided into three
stages, primarily contingent on factors like the fuel type, thermophysical
properties of the fuel, and ambient conditions. These stages are as fol-

quasi-steady/stable evaporation stage, and iii) The unsteady/fluctuation
evaporation stage. Distinguishing between these stages is achieved by
monitoring the variations in droplet size over time. Although re-
searchers may employ varying definitions for these stages, the under-
lying characteristics remain consistent [67]. The unsteady or fluctuating
evaporation stage is especially prominent in the evaporation of multi-
component fuels, where preferential evaporation of different fuel com-
ponents occurs due to variations in boiling points of fuel components.
This stage is absent in single-component fuels. Moreover, the occurrence
of the unsteady/fluctuation evaporation stage is contingent on ambient
temperature, with the need for sufficiently high temperatures to facili-
tate the formation of vapor bubbles from the more volatile fuel com-
ponents within the evaporating droplet. In the suspended droplet
method, the properties of the support fiber, including its size, thermal
conductivity, and specific heat capacity, can initiate the unsteady
evaporation stage even for single component fuel [46,59,60,257,258].
The influence of the support fiber is particularly significant when
comparing results across different experimental studies that use various
types of support fibers. This factor should be carefully considered to
ensure accurate comparisons and interpretations of experimental out-
comes. In the case of CNF droplets, a distinct fourth stage emerges in the
evaporation process, known as the dry-out stage. This stage occurs after
the complete evaporation of the liquid fuel, leaving behind agglomer-
ated nanoparticles. The concentration of these dry-out nanoparticles is
influenced by the characteristics of the preceding unsteady/fluctuation
evaporation stage, which, in turn, involves the formation of secondary
droplets through puffing/micro-explosion events that transport nano-
particles from the primary droplet.

Fig. 26 illustrates the different evaporation stages observed during
droplet evaporation experiments involving various CNFs. For instance,
Fig. 25a shows the evaporation stages of a single-component n-Decane
and GrNPL (0.10 % w/w) NF at an ambient temperature of 600
C [164].
Since the base fuel
is single component, the unsteady/fluctuation
evaporation stage was not observed. Conversely, Fig. 26b illustrates the
evaporation stages of multicomponent Jet-A and GNP CNFs, conducted
at 120
C ambient temperature [162]. Despite the base fuel being
multicomponent, the unsteady/fluctuation evaporation stage was ab-
sent due to the relatively low ambient temperature. An ambient tem-
perature is considered “low” when it is near or below the boiling point of
the base fuel, and “high” when it is significantly above it. However, the
120
C ambient temperature is much lower than typical combustion
chamber conditions. As a result, evaporation studies conducted at such
low temperatures can provide some insights into the effects of particle
concentration at that temperature, but they may not accurately repre-
sent the processes that occur under actual combustion chamber condi-
tions. Additionally, within the steady evaporation stage, sub-stages can
be identified by analyzing changes in the slope of the evaporation rate,

◦

(Ke). These changes arise from the aggregation characteristics of nano-
particles within the regressing droplet, leading to increased particle
concentration and, subsequently, a reduction in the effective evapora-
tion area. This aggregation mechanism is elaborated upon in Section
4.3.

6.1. Effect of carbon-based nanoparticle type, size, concentration

The concentration of nanoparticles within the base fuel emerges as a
critical factor influencing the evaporation characteristics of CNF drop-
lets. This influence arises from the interplay between heat-transfer
characteristics and aggregation phenomena, as previously discussed in
Section 4.1 (thermal conductivity enhancement), and Section 4.3
(particle aggregation). Consequently, nanoparticles concentration in-
troduces non-linearity into the evaporation rate of CNFs.

◦

Li et al. [164] conducted a study to examine how varying nano-
particle concentrations influence the evaporation rate (Ke) of Graphene
Nanoplatelets (GrNPL) in n-Decane CNFs at an ambient temperature of
600
C. CNFs were prepared with GrNPL concentrations ranging from
0.10 to 4.00 % w/w, accompanied by 1.00 % v/v of the surfactant
Span80. Fig. 28a illustrates the effect of nanoparticles concentration on
the evaporation rate. Remarkably, an enhanced evaporation rate,
compared to the base fuel, was observed for GrNPL concentrations up to
3.00 % w/w, with the most substantial enhancement reaching 12.60 %
at a 1.75 % w/w GrNPL concentration. However, beyond 1.75 % w/w
GrNPL concentration, the evaporation rate commenced a declining
trend. This behavior can be attributed to the aggregation of particles
near the droplet surface, which reduces the effective evaporation area,
transfer due to the
counteracting the benefits of
enhanced thermal conductivity of the liquid phase with the addition of
cNPs (refer Fig. 8b). The evaporation characteristics are the result of a
complex interplay between enhanced heat transfer and particle aggre-
gation. Specifically, the increase in particle concentration drives ag-
gregation near the droplet surface, ultimately leading to a decrease in
the evaporation rate.

Aboalhamayie et al. [162] explored the effects of cNPs type and
concentration on the evaporation characteristics and changes in thermal
conductivity of Jet-A-based CNFs. This study involved three distinct
cNPs types—CNPs (amorphous), MWCNTs (tubular), and GNPs (sheet).
Fig. 27b clearly shows that each of the three nanoparticle types
increased the evaporation rate of the base fuel across all tested particle
concentrations. However, the extent of evaporation rate enhancement
differed based on both nanoparticle type and concentration. Among all
particle types, MWCNTs exhibited the most significant enhancement in
evaporation rate, reaching 58.80 % at a particle concentration of 1.50 %
w/w, followed by CNPs at 1.00 % w/w particle concentration, resulting
in a 51.20 % enhancement. GNPs also contributed to an enhanced
evaporation rate, peaking at 42.30 % at a particle concentration of 1.00
% w/w. A more detailed analysis that examines factors such as particle
concentration, nanoparticle type, and the impact of nanoparticles on the
base fuel’s thermal conductivity, in conjunction with their aggregation

behavior and the absence of thermal radiation or forced convection
sources, will yield valuable insights into the non-linear trends observed
in evaporation rate enhancement. Comparing the evaporation rate
trends in Fig. 28b with the thermal conductivity trends in Fig. 8a reveals
a clear correlation between the two. The enhancement in evaporation
rate was closely linked to the improvement in thermal conductivity,
especially in the absence of a thermal radiation source or forced con-
vection effects. Without these external influences, the primary driver for
the increased evaporation rate was the more efficient heat transfer
within the droplet, facilitated by the nanoparticles. Notably, MWCNTs,
with its high thermal conductivity and specific surface area, yielded the
most significant evaporation rate enhancement at the particle concen-
tration of 1.50 % w/w. However, beyond this concentration, the evap-
oration rate started to decline due to aggregation, which, in turn,

Although the thermal conductivity of CNP- based CNFs continued to
increase up to a 2.00 % w/w particle concentration (refer Fig. 8a), the
evaporation rate began to decrease beyond 1.00 % w/w particle con-
centration. A similar relationship between thermal conductivity and
evaporation rate was observed for GNP-based CNFs. However, since the
ambient temperature (120
C) in the experiments was significantly
lower than typical combustion chamber conditions, it remains uncertain
whether these observations will hold true under actual combustion
chamber conditions. Further studies at higher temperatures are neces-
sary to validate whether the enhanced thermal conductivity and evap-
oration rate observed at lower temperatures will persist in the more
extreme environment of a combustion chamber.

Mei et al. [260] further explored the effects of different particle
concentrations (50 mg/L, 100 mg/L, 150 mg/L) and particle sizes (20
nm, 50 nm) on droplet evaporation rates under two distinct ambient
temperatures (400

tion rate was designated as the “average evaporation rate (Kavg),"
defined as the ratio of the initial droplet volume to the evaporation time.

evaporation rates at both ambient temperatures. These findings high-
light the significance of particle type, size, and concentration and
highlight the influence of ambient temperature on the particle concen-
tration range where enhancements in heat transfer characteristics
translate into increased evaporation rates. The impact of ambient tem-
perature will be explored in the subsequent section.

6.2. Effect of ambient temperature

The influence of ambient temperature on CNF droplet evaporation
characteristics is a critical aspect to consider, as it profoundly affects the
interplay of heat transfer processes within these droplets. Traditionally,
for pure fuel droplets, we observe a direct relationship between evapo-
ration rate (Ke) and ambient temperature, a rise in temperature corre-
sponds to an increase in Ke [164]. Moreover, as ambient temperature
climbs, we often witness the emergence of the unsteady/fluctuation
evaporation stage (a phenomenon applicable to multicomponent fuels)
with greater intensity and at an earlier stage of droplet evaporation. This
stage only occurs when the ambient temperature exceeds the boiling
point of the highly volatile components in the fuel. Furthermore, a
sufficient concentration of these high-volatility components is essential
to induce preferential evaporation effects that can lead to puffing and
micro-explosions. However, the evaporation characteristics can differ in
low ambient temperature and high ambient temperature for CNF
droplets (Fig. 30) [164]. This departure arises due to the intricate
interplay between two competing mechanisms: the enhancement of heat

tion and the aggregation tendencies of nanoparticles within the evapo-
rating droplet [60].

In a study by Li et al. [164], the evaporation characteristics of
GrNPL/n-Decane CNFs were explored under a range of ambient tem-
peratures spanning from 300
C. These CNFs were prepared
C to 700
with a composition of 0.10 % w/w GrNPL and 1.00 % v/v surfactant
(Span80). Fig. 30a shows the evolution of squared dimensionless droplet
diameters with normalized time for 0.10 % w/w GrNPL/n-Decane-based
CNFs during evaporation at different ambient temperatures. CNF
droplets consistently adhered to the d2-law of evaporation across all
ambient temperatures investigated, with no observable unsteady/-
fluctuation evaporation stage. This consistency can be attributed to the
single-component nature of the base fuel, coupled with the use of a low
thermal conductivity support fiber. Fig. 30b provides a clear insight into
how evaporation rate (Ke) responds to varying ambient temperatures. It
is evident that Ke increased linearly with rising ambient temperature.
These results align with a similar pattern identified by Mei et al. [260],
as shown in Fig. 29.

However, the situation becomes more intricate when examining how
different ambient temperatures affect CNF droplet evaporation (see
Fig. 29). At a lower ambient temperature (400
C), Ke experienced a

◦

decrease with increasing particle concentration and particle size. This
decrease was attributed to the longer evaporation time (τd) incurred at
lower temperatures. Consequently, particles were afforded more time to
migrate toward the droplet surface, thereby reducing the effective
evaporation area and offsetting the advantages derived from enhanced
heat transfer. Moreover, increased particle concentrations intensified
particle migration, leading to a further reduction in the evaporation rate,
Ke. Conversely, at a higher ambient temperature (700
C), the shorter
evaporation time (τd) resulted in weaker particle aggregation near the
droplet surface, allowing for an enhancement in the evaporation rate
(Ke). On the other hand, smaller particles exhibit higher Ke due to their
reduced particle migration time (τparticle). Yet, even at high ambient
temperatures, the aggregation effect, while present, remains insufficient
to counteract the overall increase in Ke when compared to the base fuel.

6.3. Effect of thermal radiation absorption

Thermal radiation absorption can affect the evaporation character-
istics of CNF droplets. While previous discussions on CNF droplet
evaporation have focused mainly on conduction as the primary heat
transfer mechanism, the introduction of thermal radiation source (e.g.:
flame) as an additional heat source can lead to complex heat transfer

evaporation dynamics of ethanol droplets containing graphite nano-
particles (GrNP) under infrared (IR) radiation. This study involved CNFs

instantaneous evaporation rates of CNF droplets increased during the
initial stages of their lifetimes, primarily due to enhanced heat transfer
resulting from improved thermal conductivity. However, as the droplet
size decreased, the effect of particle aggregation began to outweigh the

Interestingly, when IR radiation was introduced, the evaporation
characteristics of GrNP/Ethanol CNFs follow similar qualitative trend as
those observed under natural convection conditions. However, the
presence of thermal radiation significantly amplified the evaporation
rates, indicating enhanced heat transfer through radiation absorption
combined with improved heat conduction due to the presence of carbon
nanoparticles cNPs (see Fig. 32a and b). Fig. 32c provides a direct
comparison between the instantaneous evaporation rates of CNFs with
and without incident thermal radiation. Since the only variable in the
experiments was the application of thermal radiation, the observed
differences in evaporation rates can be solely attributed to the presence
of the thermal radiation source. During the initial stages of the droplet’s
lifetime, the increase in evaporation rates was particularly noticeable.
This effect was especially pronounced at higher particle concentrations,
where nanoparticles accumulated near the droplet surface, the primary
site of thermal radiation absorption, as discussed in Section 4.2. The
efficient conduction of heat throughout the droplet, owing to improved
thermal conductivity, further contributed to this enhanced evaporation.
These observations highlight the complex interplay between various
heat transfer mechanisms within CNF droplets and their impact on
evaporation dynamics.

Another study by Gan et al. [159] investigated how ultra-
violet–visible range radiation absorption affects the evaporation char-
research focused on
acteristics of various CNF droplets. This
ethanol-based CNFs containing carbon-based nanoparticles (CNPs and
MWCNTs) and aluminum nanoparticles (nano Al), all at a fixed particle
concentration of 0.10 % w/w. The study also explored the effects of
different radiation intensities, ranging from 75 to 150 W. The results
showed that the evaporation rates of all nanofuels were higher than
those of pure ethanol across all radiation levels, suggesting that radia-
tion absorption, coupled with improved heat distribution within the

droplet due to enhanced thermal conductivity, led to increased evapo-
ration rates (see Fig. 9a). Among the nanofuels, MWCNT-based NFs
demonstrated the most significant enhancement in evaporation rates,
followed by Al-based NFs and CNP-based NFs. Temperature profiles
supported these findings, with MWCNT-based NFs showing the greatest
increase in droplet temperature (refer to Fig. 9b). The enhancement in
evaporation was attributed to the improved absorption of incident ra-
diation, coupled with the improved heat conduction in the nanofluids
(NFs) due to the presence of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles effectively
absorbed the thermal radiation, which contributed additional energy to
the droplet. This energy, combined with the enhanced thermal con-
ductivity provided by the nanoparticles, facilitated more efficient heat
transfer throughout the droplet, leading to an increase in the evapora-
tion rate. Although the thermal radiation explored in the study by Gan
et al. [159] was in the ultraviolet–visible range, the observed effects of
thermal radiation absorption on evaporation rate were qualitatively
similar to those reported in Tanvir et al. [223], where infrared (IR) ra-
diation was utilized. This similarity suggests that the underlying
mechanisms of radiation absorption and its impact on evaporation rates
may be consistent across different radiation wavelengths.

7. Combustion characteristics of CNF droplet

7.1. Combustion rate (CR)/burning rate (BR)

The addition of cNPs can significantly modify the burning rate (BR)
or combustion rate (CR) of liquid fuels, and these modifications result
from a complex interplay of various mechanisms. Understanding these
mechanisms is crucial
for optimizing the performance of carbon
nanoparticle-enhanced fuels. These mechanisms include particle ag-
gregation, alteration of surface tension, changes in chemical composi-
tion, surface energy at the liquid/gas interface, radiation absorption by
particles, thermal conductivity, and physical interactions at the gas-
liquid interface. To evaluate the overall impact of these modifications,
experimental results are typically analyzed using the d2-law. Equation
(19) is commonly applied to calculate the burning rate, providing a
quantitative measure of the influence of the various factors on the
combustion process. High burning rates of fuels are particularly ad-

generally categorize the CNF burning process into four stages:

• Droplet pre-heating and pre-ignition stage: This stage determines the

ignition delay, which we will discuss further in Section 7.2.

• Liquid fuel burning stage: This stage can be further divided into two

stages:
o Quasi-steady burning stage: This stage represents the period of
significant and relatively stable burning. It tends to be more pro-
nounced in CNFs when the base fuel is a single-component fuel.
o Unsteady burning stage: This stage involves puffing and micro-
explosion mechanisms, significantly impacting the burning rate.
We will discuss this stage in Section 7.3.

• Particle and aggregate burning stage: Most of the nanoparticles burn
during this stage after the liquid fuel has been consumed. The extent
of this stage depends on the concentration of particles burned during
the unsteady stage and the initial particle concentration in CNF.

7.1.1. Effects of carbon-based nanoparticle type, size, and concertation

The concentration of nanoparticles in the CNF plays an important
role in both the quasi-steady and unsteady burning stages. Two opposing
mechanisms are typically observed:

• There exists an optimal particle concentration where burning rate
enhancement is highest. At this concentration, a delicate balance
between thermal transport enhancement and aggregation mecha-
nisms results in the most efficient burning of the fuel (see Fig. 34a–e)
[47,67,161].

• High particle concentration can reduce the burning rate due to rapid
aggregation, which limits the vaporization of the liquid phase. The
influence of aggregation also depends on the particle type. Notably,
1D and 2D particles can enhance the burning rate at lower concen-
trations (<0.30 % w/w). However, at higher concentrations,
particularly around ~0.50 % w/w, aggregation effects become more
pronounced, resulting in a decreased burning rate [46,59,60].
Furthermore, burning rate enhancement may also depend on the
characteristic size of the particles, defined as the highest mean size in
any direction. The nanoparticles mentioned in Fig. 34a–f had

improvements manifest in shorter combustion durations, increased en-
gine brake thermal efficiency, enhanced fuel economy, and more com-
plete combustion, resulting in reduced emissions. Together, these
enhancements create opportunities for downsizing combustion devices.
Fig. 33a–d presents the trends observed in various CNF droplet com-
bustion studies, demonstrating consistency with the d2-law of combus-
tion [111,143,161,230]. These trends highlight
the relationship
between droplet size and burning time, confirming the applicability of
the d2-law in modeling the combustion behavior of CNF droplets across
different experimental conditions. Typically, the burning behavior of
CNFs differs significantly from that of base fuels due to several factors,
including the size, shape, and type of nanoparticles, base fuel properties,
particle concentration, and ambient conditions. Additionally, the oxy-
gen content of nanoparticles can also influence the burning rate. We can

characteristic lengths of AB (25–30 nm) < CNP (100 nm) < MWCNT
(1000–2000 nm) < GNP (5000 nm) [47,67,161]. Particles with
lower characteristic lengths tend to enhance the burning rate at
relatively higher concentration.

It should be noted that variations in reported burning rates for the
same fuel often arise from differences in data reduction approaches,
from the support medium effects or ambient conditions during the
experiment. Additionally, the notably higher burning rates reported for
diesel in some cases (e.g., Fig. 34e: Diesel = 1.46 mm2/s) might be
influenced by external convective effects [143]. Comparing these results
with burning rates of different base fuels, which is typically ≤1.00
mm2/s, can help clarify these differences. A notable feature of nano-
particles is their high surface area. However, there is limited evidence
suggesting that there is no direct correlation between burning rate
enhancement and specific surface area (SSA),
indicating that the
burning rate may be less sensitive to surface area characteristics (see
Fig. 35) [111].

7.1.2. Effects of carbon-based nanoparticles’ oxygen content

The oxygen content of nanoparticles can significantly impact the
burning process. Typically, as the oxygen content in particles increases,
the thermal conductivity of CNFs decreases [261–264]. Moreover,
during combustion, additional oxygen from nanoparticles can lead to
the complete burning of fuel components, reducing harmful emissions.

Complete combustion also yields more energy per unit of fuel. Burning
rate can increase as the oxidation level of nanoparticles decreases [158].
This enhancement in burning rate for particles with reduced oxidation
levels is primarily driven by thermal transport properties, and this effect
becomes more pronounced at higher particle concentrations (refer
Fig. 36) [158]. However, it is essential to note that further research is
needed in this area, as only limited studies have explored the effect of
particles’ oxygen content on CNF burning rate.

7.1.3. Effects of ambient pressure

Ambient pressure can also influence the burning rate of CNFs.
Elevated ambient pressure typically increases the boiling point of pure
fuel, resulting in suppressed evaporation and reduced burning rate. This
leads to a narrower flame width and incomplete combustion due to the
suppression of mass diffusion and improper mixing of fuel vapor and
oxidizer [150,265]. However, narrower flames at higher pressures can
enhance the radiation absorption of particles near the CNF droplet
surface, thus accelerating the evaporation rate and resulting in burning
rate enhancement. Experimental evidence supports the relationship
between pressure increase and burning rate enhancement of CB/ethanol
CNFs, with more noticeable changes at higher pressures (see Fig. 37)
[150]. Further studies are needed to gain a more comprehensive un-
derstanding of the effect of ambient pressure on CNF burning rate.

micro-explosion (see Fig. 38b) [143,144]. Fuels with a wider boiling
point range, such as crude oil, exhibited greater enhancement in burning
rate at specific particle concentrations [46,59]. However, when the fuel
class remains the same, burning rate enhancement tends to follow a
similar trend for the same nanoparticles and particle concentration
range. Fig. 38c shows a similar burning rate enhancement trend with the
same carbon-based nanoparticle but with two different kerosene-based
fuels: Jet-A is used for airplanes and Isrosene has been developed for

components,

Ignition delay (ID) is a critical combustion parameter, representing
the time duration from ignition initiation to the appearance of a stable
flame [143,144,150]. The ID can be divided into two components: a
physical delay term and a chemical delay term [266–269]. The physical
delay involves processes such as droplet heating, evaporation, and fuel
vapor-air mixing, while the chemical delay is associated with
pre-combustion
the
Among
pre-combustion reaction within the air-fuel mixture stands out as the
most influential factor in determining the overall ID. Understanding the
ignition delay (ID) in CNF droplet combustion experiments requires
considering multiple factors, including droplet size, the ignition mech-
anism, ambient conditions (temperature and pressure), the relative
positioning of the heat source and droplet, the droplet suspension
method, and the initial droplet temperature. However, direct compari-
sons of ID values between various investigations pose inherent chal-
lenges due to the diversity in methodologies employed across
experimental studies. It is noteworthy that studies on the ignition delay
of CNF droplets mainly focus on the physical delay, which is influenced
by factors such as droplet size and the ignition mechanism used. This
divergence is evident when comparing ignition delay values of different
base fuels obtained from droplet-scale studies, typically on the order of
O(1000 ms) [46,59], with those from more widely accepted methods
such as constant volume combustion chambers, shock tubes, and rapid
compression machines, which typically yield ignition delay times on the
order of O(1 ms) [270–273]. Thus, ignition delay from droplet study
should be treated as qualitative indicator of ignition quality under the
specific experiment conditions. It is crucial to establish standardized
methods for quantifying the ignition delay of CNFs to accurately
determine the impact of carbon nanoparticles, especially on the chem-
ical delay aspect of ignition.

CNFs exhibit varying impacts on ignition delay (ID) depending on

7.1.4. Effects of base fuel type

The properties of the base fuel also influence the burning process of
CNFs. Specifically, more volatile fuels tend to experience enhanced
liquid phase vaporization due to thermal transport enhancement. The
viscosity and surface tension of the base fuel can affect the burning
process, as well as the characteristics of particle aggregation inside the
CNF droplet. Variations in fuel composition can be strategically lever-
aged to induce localized heating spots, leading to vapor formation
within the droplet, which, in turn, triggers puffing and micro-explosion.
These mechanisms increase air-fuel mixing by expanding the droplet’s
surface area. More volatile fuels generally exhibit a higher enhancement
in burning rate, but it is essential to consider the influence of particle
concentration (see Fig. 38a) [161,265]. For instance, puffing and
micro-explosion suppression were reported at relatively higher particle
loading (>1.00 %) [144]. Additionally, the boiling point range of con-
stituent fuel components plays a crucial role in the onset of puffing and

ability in ignition delay (ID) for CNFs, with some studies reporting an
increase while others observed a decrease [111,143,158,230,274]. Low

of the base fuel, as reported in both droplet-scale and engine-scale
studies (see Section 8.2). This phenomenon can be attributed to the
dominant influence of enhanced heat transfer characteristics in addition
to probable catalytic effect, facilitating earlier formation of combustible
fuel vapor and, consequently, reducing ignition delay. In contrast, as
particle concentrations surpass a certain threshold, the ignition delay
tends to increase (refer Fig. 39a–e) [111,143,158,230,274]. At these
higher concentrations, a significant portion of the particles accumulates
near the droplet surface. Due to the comparatively slow timescale of
particle diffusion relative to the droplet regression rate, redistributing
these particles from the surface to the droplet center becomes less
feasible. This aggregation near the droplet surface effectively reduces
the available evaporation surface area, leading to delayed combustible
vapor formation and, consequently, prolonged ID. While the surface
characteristics of nanoparticles may play a role in this context, a lack of
comprehensive data necessitates further investigation. It is worth noting
that nanoparticle type appears to have a limited impact on ignition delay
in CNFs (see Fig. 39a and b), while oxygen content within the nano-
particles has shown the potential to influence ID (refer Fig. 39f), with
higher oxygen content correlating with prolonged ignition delay.

Ambient conditions significantly influence the ignition delay of CNF
droplets. For example, an increase in ambient temperature generally
results in shorter ignition delays compared to base fuels, primarily due
to the enhanced heat transfer capabilities of the CNFs [274]. Pressure
also plays a critical role in ignition delay. Elevated pressures tend to
suppress fuel vapor generation from the droplet surface, leading to
increased ignition delays (Fig. 40a) [150]. In some instances, higher
ambient pressures can cause CNFs and base fuels to exhibit similar
ignition delays. Conversely, higher ambient temperatures not only
improve heat transfer between the droplet and its surroundings but also
accelerate chemical kinetics, both of which contribute to shorter ignition
delays (see Fig. 40b) [274].

Recent study [163] have shown that both functionalized and
non-functionalized MWCNTs reduce the ignition delay in various base
fuels, including biodiesel and commercial diesel, at concentrations of 50
ppm and 100 ppm. (see Fig. 41). Functionalized MWCNTs, in particular,
had a more pronounced effect, likely due to their superior dispersion
within the base fuel. This enhanced dispersion was confirmed by
analyzing the hydrodynamic diameter evolution, which indicated better
nanoparticle distribution in the fuel.

Ignition delay in carbon nanoparticle-based nanofuels (CNFs) is a
complex parameter affected by various factors, including particle con-
centration, nanoparticle properties, ambient conditions, and droplet
size. While existing research provided valuable insights into these

particle surface properties and the roles of different nanoparticle types
to enhance our understanding of ignition delay. Moreover, standard-
izing measurement methodologies, such as employing constant volume
combustion chambers, shock tubes, and rapid compression machines, is
essential for achieving consistent and comparable results. This stan-
dardization is crucial for advancing the study of chemical kinetics in

7.3. Micro-explosion and puffing

Micro-explosion and puffing are critical parameters for assessing
how nanoparticles impact the unsteady characteristics of base fuels [46,
59,173]. Due to the inherent complexity of CNF droplet combustion,
characterized
and underlying
multiphase-multiscale interactions, the study of micro-explosion and
puffing presents significant challenges [70,230]. These phenomena

consistently greater than that of puffing.

The formation and release of unburnt fuel vapor jets, the generation
of satellite/child droplets, and the deformation of droplet shape and
distortion of the flame shape can all contribute to improved atomization
and air-fuel mixing. Consequently, these unsteady phenomena, micro-
explosion, and puffing, are favored for enhancing in-cylinder combus-
tion processes, ultimately leading to improved thermal and fuel effi-
ciency. While micro-explosion and high-intensity puffing are typically
observed during the unsteady burning stage of CNF droplets, low-
intensity puffing has also been documented during the steady burning
stage in various studies [46,59].

Researchers have reported both reductions [230] and enhancements
[160] in puffing and micro-explosion occurrences at low and medium
particle concentrations. However, as particle concentration increased,
there was a consistent trend of intensified micro-explosion and reduced
occurrences (see Fig. 42b) [230]. It should be noted that in the reported
study, a 0.30 mm thick Type K thermocouple wire was used to suspend
the droplet. Given the size of the suspension medium and the thermal
conductivity of the thermocouple elements, it is likely that the initiation
of micro-explosions was significantly influenced by the support fiber.
Additionally, the use of larger initial droplet sizes contributed to a more
pronounced microexplosion process [46,59,60]. This is due to the
greater accumulation of volatile components inside the droplet, which,
upon heating, leads to significant pressure buildup before the droplet
ultimately undergoes a microexplosion [276,277,278]. However, since
all the CNFs and base fuels were tested under similar experimental
conditions, it is evident that the carbon nanoparticles (cNPs) themselves
also have a significant impact on the micro-explosion characteristics.
The effect of cNPs on micro-explosion is further evident in Fig. 43 (a-e)
comparing the fluctuations in droplet size, the intensity of fluctuations,
and the number of occurrences.

Mosadegh et al. [158] conducted an extensive analysis of the puffing
and micro-explosion characteristics in ethanol/graphene oxide CNFs.
Their findings revealed that the most probable size of ejected droplets
was approximately 50 μm, which was significantly smaller (about 55
times) than the size of the parent/mother droplet (see Fig. 45b) [158].
Additionally, the most probable velocity of the ejected droplets was
measured at 0.50 m/s, comparable to the laminar flame speed of ethanol
and air at stoichiometric conditions (see Fig. 45a) [158]. The most
probable trajectory length of the ejected droplets was estimated to be
around 1.00 mm (see Fig. 45c) [158]. It is worth noting that larger child
droplets may not burn due to their high initial ejection velocity and
longer trajectories. However, the majority of ejected droplets exhibit
ejection velocities similar to the flame speed, indicating their propensity
to burn before leaving the flame region. Trajectories of ejected droplets
are visually represented in Fig. 44 [163]. It should be noted that a

originate with the formation of vapor bubbles, primarily driven by the
more volatile components within the fuel mixture. These bubbles may
either collapse within the droplet, near its surface, or merge to form
larger bubbles. Interestingly, carbon nanoparticles can serve as local
nucleation sites, facilitating the heterogeneous nucleation of highly
volatile components and the formation of vapor bubbles inside the
droplet. Eventually, these bubbles rupture when the vapor pressure in-
side them exceeds the surface energy of the less volatile fuel component
at the bubble-liquid interface. Upon bubble rupture, unburnt fuel vapor
is jetted out, often accompanied by satellite or child droplets containing
particles (see Fig. 42a) [230]. This process can deform the droplet from
its initial spherical shape, leading to irregular shapes. The released un-
burnt fuel vapor and satellite/child droplets can enter the flame region,
thereby distorting the flame shape. These distortions in flame and
droplet shape significantly impact the evaporation and combustion
processes by altering the effective surface area available for fuel
vaporization and inducing thermal asymmetries around the burning
droplet.

Micro-explosion and puffing can be quantified based on the degree of
changes in droplet size during the process, often referred to as “micro-
explosion/puffing intensity” [276,277]. Typically, if the droplet is not
severely deformed or shattered and does not lose a significant fraction of
its mass due to satellite/child droplet formation, it is termed as puffing.
In contrast, micro-explosion is characterized by the complete shattering

plosion.” In quantifiable terms, the intensity of micro-explosion is

borosilicate tube with a 1.00 mm outer diameter was used to suspend the
droplet, and given the size of the suspension medium, the initiation of
micro-explosions in the reported study likely had a significant contri-
bution from the support fiber. However, since all the CNFs and base fuels
were tested under similar experimental conditions, it is evident that the
carbon nanoparticles (cNPs) themselves also have a significant impact
on the micro-explosion characteristics.

The ejection of child or satellite droplets from puffing and micro-
explosions is an efficient mechanism for exposing nanoparticles to the
flame, where the nanoparticles themselves can undergo combustion and
release additional energy, particularly in the case of energetic nano-
particles. Fig. 46 illustrates the particle burning facilitated by micro-
explosions during CNF droplet combustion across different experi-
ments [150,161]. Additionally, it is important to note that elevated
ambient pressure has been observed to reduce both the intensity and
frequency of micro-explosions [150]. This effect is shown in Fig. 47,
where the number of particles burning during the combustion of CNFs
decreased as the pressure increased [150]. This observation highlights
the significant influence of ambient conditions on micro-explosion
dynamics.

It is important to recognize the complexity and observational chal-
lenges that arise when transitioning from studying micro-explosion and
puffing in individual fuel droplets to analyzing real spray flames. While
these phenomena enhance air-fuel mixing at the microscale, researchers
studying spray flames primarily concentrate on macroscopic flame
properties such as structure, combustion efficiency, emissions, and soot

formation, considering their collective impact on practical applications.
Directly observing micro-explosion and puffing in real spray flames
becomes challenging due to the multitude of droplets and their varying
sizes within the spray. Nevertheless, insights from microscale studies
remain valuable, guiding the design of CNFs and combustion systems for
enhanced performance and bridging the gap between microscale and
macroscale combustion understanding.

The study of micro-explosions and puffing in CNFs is complex and
influenced by several factors, including particle concentration, ambient
conditions, and the characteristics of the nanoparticles. Given the
limited research on puffing/micro-explosion behavior in CNFs, espe-
cially concerning the role of support media, further extensive studies are
essential. These studies should focus on quantifying how fuel component
volatility interacts with carbon nanoparticles to affect the initiation of
puffing and micro-explosions.

7.4. Burning period (BP)/burning time (BT)

The burning period of CNF droplets plays an important role in un-
derstanding the combustion dynamics, hinging on several key factors:
pre-ignition stage characteristics, burning rate, micro-explosion and
puffing events, and the initial liquid fuel quantity [46,59]. It can be
defined as the time span from the inception of the flame to its extinction
due to complete liquid fuel combustion. A heightened burning rate,
driven by enhanced combustion kinetics, results in a shortened burning
period. Additionally, an increased occurrence of micro-explosions can

forming a shell-like structure and reducing temperature in the reaction
zone, thereby extinguishing the flame prematurely and leading to
incomplete combustion. Micro-explosions also played a role, with
GNP-based CNFs
albeit weaker,
micro-explosions than MWCNT and CNP-based CNFs. In the cases of
CNP and MWCNT-based CNFs, the burning rate was a more direct in-
fluence on the burning period. The base fuel, in this scenario, comprises
a blend with distinct boiling points, and the intensified micro-explosions
were linked to particle concentration. High-intensity micro-explosions
tend to eject droplets with higher mass, thus contributing to a direct
reduction in the burning period.

frequent,

In Fig. 48b, the direct dependence of the burning period on burning
rate can be compared. Burning rate enhancement was mentioned in
Fig. 34d [230]. Despite varying degrees of burning rate enhance-
ment—around 12.9 %, 22.5 %, and 2.5 % for MF15C25, MF15C50, and
MF15C100, respectively, when compared to MF15, the burning period
of MF15C100 exhibited a significant reduction, predominantly attrib-
utable to high-intensity micro-explosions (refer Fig. 42b). Fig. 48c
demonstrates that, despite a decrease in burning rates (Fig. 34e), the
burning period of the listed CNFs generally decreased compared to the
base fuel [143]. The higher ignition delay of CNFs compared to the base
fuel was considered a key driver behind this downward trend.

Table S3 summarizes key findings and data regarding the combus-
tion characteristics of liquid fuels enhanced with carbon nanoparticles,
as discussed in the preceding sections. This table offers an overview of
how various factors—such as particle concentration, type, size, oxygen
content, and ambient pressure—affect critical combustion parameters,
including combustion rate, ignition delay, micro-explosion, puffing, and
burning period.

8. Spray characteristics and engine-scale experiments

In the previous sections, we have discussed how carbon-based
nanoparticles can modify the evaporation and combustion characteris-
tics of various CNFs at the droplet scale, including aspects such as
evaporation rate, burning rate, ignition delay, burning period, and
micro-explosion. To understand how these modifications impact engine-
scale performance, we will briefly discuss several experimental studies
focusing on CNFs and their spray characteristics in engines. While
engine-scale studies are not the primary focus of this manuscript, and
extensive reviews on this topic are already available [4,46,47,59,81,
279], this section aims to bridge the gap between droplet-scale obser-
vations and real-world engine scenarios.

8.1. Spray characteristics

Fuel atomization into droplets in spray is a complex process influ-
enced by factors such as the fuel’s physical properties, nozzle geometry,
and injection conditions [131,280–287]. While there is limited direct
research on CNFs in this context,
insights from studies involving
metal-based nanofuels (MNFs) can provide valuable information.
Although MNF studies predominantly explore non-reacting sprays, these
findings are relevant because non-reacting spray characteristics pri-
marily depend on the inherent properties of the fuel and the nano-
particles dispersed within [280–287]. As long as the physical properties
of nanofuels remain relatively unchanged, observations from MNF spray
characteristics can be applied to predict CNF spray behavior.

Spray characteristics are broadly classified into two categories:
macroscopic and microscopic. Macroscopic spray characteristics include
parameters such as spray cone angle, spray sheet breakup length, spray
tip penetration, and maximum spray width [279–283]. On the other
hand, microscopic characteristics focus on mean droplet diameter and
liquid spray breakup lengths [279–283]. The relationship between these
characteristics and combustion efficiency is crucial. An increased spray
cone angle and wider spray width, coupled with a decrease in spray
sheet breakup length and spray tip penetration, enhance atomization by

also lead to a reduced burning period due to the loss of liquid fuel during
droplet fragmentation. Conversely, a more prolonged pre-ignition stage
or increased heating duration vaporizes a greater proportion of the fuel
before combustion initiation, leading to a shorter burning period. The
burning period significantly influences both premixed and diffusion
combustion processes. A shorter burning period, especially at lower CNF
indicates heightened mass diffusion, potentially
concentrations,
improving combustion efficiency. Furthermore, the concentration of
nanoparticles further modulates the burning period, affecting the
available liquid fuel for combustion. Consequently, at higher particle
concentration, the burning period of CNF droplets tends to decrease,
even if the burning rate is comparably lower than that of the base fuel.
Importantly, these interactions among burning rate, pre-ignition char-
acteristics, particle concentration, and micro-explosion dynamics result
in non-linear alterations in the CNF droplet’s burning period compared
to the respective base fuel. Fig. 48a–c illustrates the trends in burning
period observed across various CNFs in droplet combustion studies,
encompassing a wide range of particle concentrations [142,161,230].

In all cases, it is evident that the introduction of nanoparticles
reduced the burning period of the base fuel. Furthermore, an increase in
particle concentration intensified this reduction. However, the mecha-
nisms driving this decrease differ among the various types of CNFs. In
Fig. 48a, the primary contributor for the reduction in burning period was
the burning rate, with MWCNT and GNP exhibiting their maximum
burning rates at substantially lower loadings compared to CNP based
CNFs (refer Fig. 34a–c). This resulted in GNP and MWCNT-based CNFs
displaying the shortest burning periods at lower concentrations [161].
Beyond this optimal point, particle aggregation at the droplet surface
became pronounced, diminishing the available evaporative surface area,
thereby elongating the burning period. In the case of GNP-based CNFs, a
decreasing trend in burning period beyond the point of maximum
burning rate enhancement was observed, diverging from MWCNT-based
CNFs. Flame extinction and incomplete droplet burnout were proposed
explanations for this trend. The accumulation of GNP near the droplet’s
surface towards the end of combustion possibly acted as a heat sink,

ensuring more efficient contact between fuel particles and air
[281–283]. Longer spray breakup lengths can lead to narrow, unsteady
sprays, potentially resulting in fuel adhesion to combustion chamber
walls. Conversely, wider spray angles and larger spray widths promote
well-distributed sprays, enhancing fuel-air mixing [279–283]. Smaller
mean droplet diameters within the spray lead to faster evaporation and
more complete combustion, although smaller droplet sprays may
struggle to accelerate fuel-air mixing [279–283]. Shorter liquid spray
breakup lengths increase the likelihood of secondary atomization
[279–283].

Macroscopic spray characteristics of Diesel/MWCNT, Diesel/CeO2,
GTL/MWCNT, and GTL/CeO2 based nanofuels were investigated at a
particle concentration of 40 ppm across different injection pressures
(90–180 MPa) and elevated ambient conditions (Pressure: 1–4 MPa and
Temperature: 300–600 K) using a constant volume vessel (CVV) [287].
Here, GTL (gas-to-liquid) stands as an alternative, cleaner fuel derived
from methane through the Fischer-Tropsch synthetic process. The
findings indicated that CeO2 and MWCNT have minimal effects on spray
cone angles. They reduced spray penetration of Diesel at low ambient
pressures (1 MPa), with a milder impact on GTL due to its lighter
composition. However, as the ambient pressure increased to 4 MPa, the
nanoparticles exhibited no significant influence on spray penetration.

concentration

The study also showed that the average cone angle was unaffected by
rail pressure but can be reduced by decreasing ambient pressure and
increasing ambient temperature. During injection, both ambient and rail
pressure influenced spray penetration, while post-injection, only
ambient temperature had an effect. Comparative analysis of spray
characteristics between Jet A-1 and Jet A-1/Al2O3 nanofuels at varying
particle concentrations (0.50–2.00 % w/w) and injection pressures
(0.30, 0.90 MPa) under ambient temperature (298 K) concluded that
nanofuel sprays exhibited smaller spray sheet breakup lengths, smaller
mean droplet diameters, and higher mean axial velocities [285].
Notably, smaller mean droplet diameters were attributed to extended
time available for secondary atomization due to faster liquid sheet
disintegration with increasing particle concentration and increasing
pressure. The higher axial velocity indicated that smaller nanofuel
droplets possessed greater momentum, with density increasing as par-

particles on liquid sheet stability and breakup dynamics, leading to
earlier spray sheet disruption and smaller breakup lengths for nanofuels
when compared to their base fuels under elevated ambient conditions.

spray characteristics [284]. These enhancements included increased
spray tip penetration distance, wider spray cone angle, higher tip ve-
locity, and larger spray area, coupled with a reduced spray sheet
break-up time (refer to Fig. 49). The expanded spray area was attributed
to the elevated momentum generated by the nanoparticles.

investigations,

Spray characteristics are significantly influenced by the injection
system and ambient conditions. Experimental evidence indicates that
the addition of nanoparticles can improve fuel spray characteristics for
enhanced combustion performance by reducing spray sheet breakup
length, liquid spray breakup lengths, and mean droplet diameter, while
increasing spray area and spray cone angle. However, the specific
properties of carbon nanoparticles, such as type, size, specific surface
area, density, and particle concentration, can significantly impact fuel
spray characteristics under different injection and ambient conditions.
Additionally, the effect of particle agglomeration on spray structure and
dynamics remains a topic requiring further investigation.

concentration Furthermore, while Table S4 covers the most commonly
reported parameters, individual studies may highlight additional pa-
rameters depending on their specific focus.

8.2.1. Trends in combustion parameters

Internal combustion engines rely on key combustion parameters,
including Ignition Delay Period (IDP), Peak Cylinder Pressure (PCP),
and Heat Release Rate (HRR), to gauge the combustion process and
[46,47,59,70–74,81,288]. These parameters
engine performance
exhibit intricate relationships that significantly influence engine effi-
ciency and operation. Ignition Delay Period (IDP) measures the time
interval between fuel injection initiation and the commencement of
combustion within the engine cylinder. A shorter IDP can advance PCP
timing, leading to more efficient and controlled combustion. This, in
turn, yields a rapid surge in pressure during the power stroke, elevating
both PCP and HRR. Conversely, a longer IDP may delay PCP, impacting
engine thermal efficiency and elevating exhaust gas temperatures due to
a more gradual heat release. The introduction of carbon nanoparticles
into the fuel matrix adds a novel dimension to this interplay. Carbon
nanoparticles possess distinct thermophysical properties, including a
high surface area, influencing fuel-air mixture reactivity. Within the
combustion context, carbon nanoparticles emerge as effective combus-
tion promoters, expediting and precisely controlling ignition processes.
Their presence consistently shortens ignition delay periods across
various engine-scale studies using different base fuels (see Table S4), as
also evident in droplet-scale and pre-mixed flame studies [46,59,112].
Peak cylinder pressure (PCP) is multifaceted in its response to CNFs. A
shorter ignition delay by CNFs can result in earlier PCP timing in the
engine cycle [70]. There is a general consensus on PCP advancement
with shortened ignition delay; however, the extent of this effect varies
based on factors such as particle type, particle concentration, engine
compression ratio, and specific operating conditions [71] (see Table S4).
In some scenarios, CNFs can even lead to higher PCP levels, owing to
heightened combustion efficiency,
improved fuel-air mixing, and
enhanced volumetric efficiency [46,47,59,70–74,81]. Modifications in
IDP and PCP, driven by CNFs, have direct implications for HRR. A
shorter ignition delay results in a swift and intense pressure surge during
the power stroke, contributing to increased HRR [46,47,59]. Enhanced
combustion characteristics, such as improved fuel-air mixing and more
efficient combustion facilitated by CNFs, further accelerate HRR. The
swifter combustion can lead to higher engine efficiency and power
output. Additionally, improved volumetric efficiency due to enhanced
mixing contributes to increased HRR. HRR variations, observed under
different engine operating conditions (see Table S4), highlight the sig-
nificance of considering factors such as load, speed, and temperature.

8.2. Observations from engine-scale experiments

8.2.2. Trends in performance parameters

This section discusses engine-scale experiments focused on evalu-
ating the impact of carbon-nanoparticle-based nanofuels (CNFs) on in-
ternal combustion engines, particularly compression ignition (CI)
engines. The discussion is organized into three main categories: (1) the
effects of CNFs on engine combustion, (2) their influence on engine
performance parameters, and (3) their implications for engine emis-
sions. These insights are crucial for understanding how CNFs could
advance automotive sustainability and performance.

Table S4 provides a comprehensive summary of engine-scale studies
investigating the impact of CNFs on various engine parameters, cate-
gorized into engine combustion parameters, engine performance pa-
rameters, and engine emission parameters. These studies offer valuable
insights into the potential benefits and challenges associated with the
use of CNFs in internal combustion engines. It is important to note that
this table presents general qualitative trends regarding the effects of
CNFs on engine parameters. The extent of these modifications depends
on several factors, including engine operating conditions, engine type,
base fuel properties, CNF type, CNF properties, and particle

Brake-Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC), Engine Torque (ET), Brake
Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Brake Power (BP), and Exhaust Gas Tem-
perature (EGT) can collectively define an internal combustion engine’s
performance and efficiency [46,47,59,70–74,81,288]. Understanding
the relationships among these parameters is vital for optimizing engine
operation. BSFC, typically expressed in grams of fuel consumed per
kilowatt-hour (g/kWh), serves as a critical indicator of an engine’s fuel
efficiency. Lower BSFC values signify greater fuel efficiency, indicating
that the engine consumes less fuel to generate a specific power output.
Conversely, higher BSFC values suggest lower fuel efficiency, as more
fuel is required for the same power output. BSFC is closely related to
Engine torque (ET) and Brake power (BP). Higher engine torque enables
the engine to generate more power with the same amount of fuel,
resulting in lower BSFC values, indicative of improved fuel efficiency.
The correlation between engine torque and brake power is straightfor-
ward: when engine torque increases, so does the brake power output.
The incorporation of carbon nanoparticles into the fuel mixture in-
troduces a significant impact on BSFC. Carbon nanoparticles enhance
combustion characteristics, such as improved fuel-air mixing and

reduced ignition delay, resulting in more efficient fuel utilization [46,
47,59,70–74,81]. Consequently, BSFC tends to decrease, signifying
improved fuel efficiency. There is a consensus among researchers
regarding the reduction of BSFC when carbon nanoparticles are intro-
duced, as supported by various engine-scale studies (see Table S4). The
relationship between Engine torque (ET) and Brake power (BP) remains
fundamental, even with the inclusion of CNFs [46,47,59,70–74,81].
Enhanced combustion efficiency facilitated by CNFs can lead to higher
engine torque, resulting in increased brake power for a given engine
speed [72]. This relationship holds true across engine-scale studies,
highlighting the potential for improved engine performance with CNFs
(see Table S4). Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) reflects how effectively an
engine converts the heat energy released during fuel combustion into
useful work (brake power). CNFs can enhance combustion dynamics,
potentially resulting in increased BTE [46,47,59,70–74,81]. CNFs pro-
mote superior fuel-air mixing and reduced ignition delay, maximizing
the conversion of heat energy into mechanical work. Consequently, the
use of CNFs can potentially lead to higher BTE, as evidenced by various
engine-scale studies (refer Table S4) [46,47,59,70–74,81]. Exhaust gas
temperature (EGT) stands as a crucial indicator of the heat generated
during combustion, its fluctuations reflecting variations in air-fuel
mixture quality [46,47,59,70–74,81]. EGT also plays an important
role in regulating mixture fractions within internal combustion engines.
Notably, engine-scale studies have presented divergent trends in EGT
while operating with CNFs, as detailed in Table S4. The introduction of
carbon nanoparticles into the combustion process exerts a dual influence
on EGT [70,73,74]. On one hand, these nanoparticles act as efficient
heat sinks in the rich mixture zone, leading to a decrease in EGT due to
effective heat dissipation. Conversely, carbon nanoparticles enhance the
premixed combustion phase and ignition quality. This enhancement
boosts overall combustion, increasing both peak cylinder pressure (PCP)
and heat release rate (HRR), consequently causing a rise in EGT.

It is essential to consider that the concentration of carbon nano-
particles in fuels significantly influences these relationships. Finding the
optimal particle concentration is crucial for maximizing engine perfor-
mance, fuel efficiency, and overall efficiency. Moreover, the improved
combustion characteristics associated with CNFs can enable engine
downsizing while maintaining power output, further contributing to
reduced BSFC. Downsized engines operate more efficiently, making
them an attractive avenue for achieving sustainability goals.

8.2.3. Trends in emission parameters

Engine emissions encompass a range of pollutants, including carbon
monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), unburnt hydrocarbons (UHC),
nitrogen oxides (NOx), and smoke opacity [46,47,59,70–74,81,288].
Each of these emissions offers valuable insights into engine combustion
dynamics and the impact of CNFs.

CO emissions result from incomplete combustion due to insufficient
oxygen within the combustion chamber [75–77,288]. Introducing car-
bon nanoparticles often leads to improved combustion efficiency,
resulting in cleaner and more complete combustion, ultimately reducing
CO emissions. This optimized combustion process allows for greater
conversion of carbon to carbon dioxide (CO2) instead of carbon mon-
oxide (CO) [75–77,288]. This trend is consistently reported in different
studies (see Table S4). UHC emissions are closely linked to inefficient
and incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels [46,47,59,70–74,81,
288]. When CNFs are employed, there is a general trend of decreased CO
and UHC emissions. CNFs enhance combustion efficiency, resulting in a
cleaner and more complete combustion process, thus reducing the
release of unburnt hydrocarbons [46,47,59,70–74,81,288]. This reduc-
tion aligns with the findings from multiple studies (refer Table S4). In
contrast to CO and UHC emissions, CO2 emissions exhibit an opposing
trend when CNFs are introduced. Carbon nanoparticles facilitate faster
burnout of the fuel and cleaner combustion, which typically decreases
CO and UHC emissions but simultaneously leads to higher CO2 emissions
due to the more efficient conversion of carbon in the fuel to CO2 [46,47,

59,70–74,81,288]. This trend has been consistently observed across
various studies (see Table S4). NOx emissions, which include nitrogen
monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are significant for air
quality and environmental concerns. The impact of CNFs on NOx
emissions is complex and context dependent. Carbon nanoparticles
(MWCNT) can act as NOx absorbents, reducing emissions [46,47,59,
70–74,81,82,288]. Additionally, their enhanced convective heat trans-
fer characteristics may induce a cooling effect, lowering cylinder tem-
peratures and reducing NOx formation [75,78,79,288,289]. However,
improvements in combustion performance might lead to elevated flame
temperatures, a primary cause of NOx formation. Consequently, both
increases and reductions in NOx emissions have been reported across
different studies (see Table S4). The reduction in smoke opacity, a visual
indicator of soot production during combustion, is a consistent outcome
observed with the introduction of CNFs in engine-scale studies [46,47,
59,70–74,81,82,288]. This decrease can be attributed to enhanced
combustion processes facilitated by carbon nanoparticles, leading to
cleaner and more thorough burning and subsequently reducing soot
production and smoke opacity. Another plausible mechanism is the
oxidation of soot particles in the presence of carbon nanoparticles [46,
47,59,70–74,81,82,288]. When soot particles, primarily composed of
carbon, are generated during combustion, their interaction with carbon
nanoparticles results in multifaceted outcomes. Firstly, carbon nano-
particles can act as catalysts, significantly lowering the activation en-
ergy required for soot oxidation [46,47,59,70–74,81,82,288]. This
catalytic action enhances the efficiency of the oxidation process,
particularly in the presence of oxygen and at elevated temperatures.
Additionally, the surface functional groups present on soot particles
engage in intricate surface reactions with carbon nanoparticles, leading
to the formation of oxides on the soot surface, making them more sus-
ceptible to oxidation. Furthermore, the high thermal conductivity of
carbon nanoparticles facilitates superior heat transfer [46,47,59,70–74,
81,82,288]. When these nanoparticles come into contact with soot
particles, they effectively elevate local temperatures, promoting the
oxidation of soot. Moreover, carbon nanoparticles have the ability to
fragment larger soot agglomerates into smaller particles. These smaller
particles possess higher reactivity due to their increased surface area,
making them more amenable to oxidation processes. Furthermore,
chemical reactions between carbon nanoparticles and the surrounding
environment produce reactive species like radicals and peroxides,
initiating and accelerating the oxidation of soot particles [46,47,59,
70–74,81,82,288]. The synergy of these processes, influenced by factors
such as temperature, pressure, oxygen concentration, and the specific
characteristics of the nanoparticles and soot particles, highlights the
intricate nature of
soot oxidation in the presence of carbon
nanoparticles.

The impact of CNFs on engine emissions is multifaceted and
contingent on various factors. Generally, CNFs contribute to cleaner and
more efficient combustion, resulting in reduced CO and UHC emissions
but potentially increasing CO2 emissions. The influence on NOx emis-
sions is complex, with outcomes depending on CNF characteristics and
engine operating conditions. Additionally, CNFs consistently lead to
reduced smoke opacity, indicating improved combustion processes.
These observations highlight the potential of CNFs to enhance both
engine performance and environmental sustainability through opti-
mized combustion dynamics.

9. Environmental and health risk aspects

Carbon-nanoparticle-based nanofuels (CNFs) offer promising bene-
fits for reducing harmful emissions and potentially improving urban air
quality and addressing global warming. These benefits stem from CNFs’
ability to enhance combustion efficiency and lower particulate emis-
sions. However, their environmental and health impacts are not fully
understood. Existing toxicological studies have raised concerns about
the cytotoxicity of carbon nanoparticles, which can vary based on size,

shape, and chemical composition [46,59,115–117,123]. Additionally,
their environmental effects are complex, involving potential disruptions
to soil, water, and living organisms [46,59,115–117,123]. Despite the
potential advantages of CNFs, these risks highlight the need for further
research to thoroughly assess and mitigate their environmental and
health impacts, ensuring that their benefits do not come at the expense
of public health and ecological safety.

9.1. Health risks

granuloma,

The health risks associated with carbon nanoparticles depend on
their specific properties and mechanisms of action. In-vitro studies on
cell toxicity have revealed that Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can lead to
phagocytic activity, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity [123,141]. Impor-
tantly, the toxicity of CNTs appears to be influenced by their length, with
shorter particles inducing more significant toxicity, while longer CNTs
can elicit a higher inflammatory response. The cytotoxicity of CNTs is
primarily attributed to oxidative stress mechanisms [46,59,123]. Inha-
lation of CNTs can lead to their deposition in the lungs, potentially
causing
inflammation.
Graphene-based nanoparticles also exhibit cytotoxicity, which is
dependent on the nanoparticles’ physicochemical properties. These
nanoparticles can induce oxidative stress reactions and may have
varying effects depending on cell types. While graphene-based nano-
particles are mechanically damaging to cells,
they are generally
biocompatible [46,59,123]. However, these nanoparticles can also de-
posit in the lungs and induce inflammation. Additionally, neurotoxic
effects have been reported for graphene-based nanoparticles [123,141].
Fullerene-based nanoparticles’ toxicity is influenced by their surface
charge, and aggregates of these nanoparticles can damage cell structures
and DNA. Carbon black (CB) can affect chemical and biological oxida-
tive mechanisms, with smaller CB particles demonstrating higher
oxidative capacity and the potential for greater oxidative damage and
DNA damage [148].

9.2. Environmental impact

The environmental impact of carbon nanoparticles is complex and
depends on factors such as particle size, shape, surface coating, chemical
characteristics, and environmental conditions like pH, light exposure,
organic matter, and temperature [46,59,141]. Once released into the
atmosphere, soil, or water, carbon nanoparticles can interact with
terrestrial and aquatic organisms, causing potential harm. They may
induce DNA damage, protein denaturation, and metabolic disruptions in
microorganisms crucial for natural biodegradation processes. Carbon
nanoparticles can also affect atmospheric organisms, contribute to dust
cloud formation, and impact air quality. In plants, nanoparticles may
accumulate on leaves and harm plant health and food safety [46,59,
141]. In aquatic environments, carbon nanoparticles can influence mi-
croorganisms and the transport of other pollutants, with water-insoluble
CNTs being particularly toxic to benthic animals and aquatic organisms
[46,59,141].

Existing studies on carbon nanoparticles’ effect on cytotoxicity and
environmental impact typically involve non-altered forms. However,
nanoparticles in the combustion chamber are expected to undergo
physio-chemical changes that could alter their toxicity. Detailed post-
combustion characterization is necessary to understand these changes.

research is essential. Current studies on post-combustion characteristics

suggest

nm thick.

These findings

of nanoparticles used as liquid fuel additives are limited, with a
particular focus on metal-based nanoparticles. Dale et al. [116] exam-
ined the transformation of nanoparticles before combustion and the
characteristics of diesel exhaust particulate (DEP) from nanofuels using
bulk analytical techniques and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy. They observed that pre-combustion nanoparticles, which
were ~15 nm aggregates of 5–7 nm faceted crystals, transformed into
50–300 nm near-spherical single crystals in the exhaust. Electron
diffraction revealed changes in crystal lattice and chemical composition.
The original surfactant coating was lost during combustion, and about
30 % of the particles in the exhaust developed a new surface coating,
approximately
that
pre-combustion nanoparticles may have a different toxicological profile
after combustion, indicating the need for toxicity studies to use more
realistic representations. Zhang et al. [117] investigated the effects of
varying nanoparticle concentrations on DEP properties. They found that
increasing nanoparticle concentrations reduced DEP size, altered zeta
potential, and decreased carbon content while changing the chemical
composition. Notably, DEPs from higher nanoparticle concentrations
had lower oxidative potential, likely due to higher nanoparticle content.
These findings suggest that using nanoparticles as liquid fuel additive
can modify DEP toxicity. Zhang and Balasubramanian [126] studied the
effects of metallic (CeO2) and organo-metallic (Fe(C5H5)2) nanoparticles
in ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) on the physio-chemical properties and
toxicity of diesel particulate matter (DPM). They observed that these
nanoparticles reduced particulate mass concentration and elemental
lower engine loads, while
carbon (EC) emissions, particularly at
increasing the organic carbon (OC) to EC ratio. Nanofuels also increased
water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) mass, suggesting changes in DPM
composition and, consequently, toxicity. The study noted an increase in
total particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), espe-
cially medium and high molecular weight PAHs, and elevated n-alkane
emissions. Nanofuels shifted the particle size distribution toward
smaller particles, increasing total particle counts and reducing the
geometric mean diameter (GMD). After thermal denuding, nanoparticle
counts remained higher than with pure ULSD, indicating persistent
emissions of particles. Although nanofuels reduced soot ignition tem-
peratures and activation energies for soot oxidation, suggesting benefits
for after-treatment systems, the increased OC fraction and particle
counts imply that soot from nanofuels might have larger surface areas,
potentially enhancing oxidation reactivity. However, changes in soot
nanostructure did not directly correlate with oxidation activity, indi-
cating other combustion factors are also influential. Toxicological as-
sessments showed reduced cell viability and altered gene expression in
human epithelial cells exposed to DPM from nanofuels compared to
ULSD. Gene expression changes included up-regulation of oxidative
stress-related genes and alterations linked to cancer and cardiovascular
risks.

10. Conclusion

In this review, we have analyzed a decade of research on carbon
nano-additives-based nanofuels (CNFs), with particular emphasis on
droplet combustion and evaporation studies. By synthesizing findings
from this extensive body of work, several key conclusions have emerged,
highlighting the potential of CNFs in combustion applications:

• CNF droplet evaporation unfolds in four distinct stages: transient
heating/pre-heating, quasi-steady/stable evaporation, unsteady/
fluctuation evaporation, and dry-out. The presence of the unsteady/
fluctuation stage hinges significantly on ambient conditions and fuel
composition, with factors such as nanoparticle type, size, concen-
tration, and base fuel properties dictating evaporation characteris-
tics. CNFs can exhibit a superior evaporation rate compared to base
fuels, particularly within a particle concentration range of 0.00–3.00

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101198

% w/w. This enhancement escalates with rising particle concentra-
tion, further accelerated by increased ambient temperatures.

• The augmented evaporation rate in CNF droplets can be attributed to
their improved heat transfer properties, which result from enhanced
heat conduction throughout the droplet and, when present, the ab-
sorption of thermal radiation. However, it is important to note that
the positive impact of these enhanced heat transfer characteristics
begins to diminish beyond a specific particle concentration. Beyond
this specific particle concentration, particle aggregation on the
droplet surface starts to occur, which reduces the effective evapo-
ration area and ultimately leads to a decrease in the evaporation rate
compared to base fuel.

• These phases are intricately linked to micro-explosion and puffing
characteristics, which are heavily influenced by the composition of
the CNFs. CNF combustion generally exhibits a higher burning rate
compared to base fuels, primarily driven by particle concentration,
thermophysical properties, and the optical attributes of the carbon-
based nanoparticles. At particle concentrations below 0.50 % w/w,
the burning rate tends to increase. Additionally, elevated ambient
pressure can further enhance the burning rate of CNFs by improving
thermal radiation absorption, leading to more efficient combustion.
• CNF droplet combustion and evaporation generally follows the d2-
law during the significant portion of the burning and evaporation
period.

• CNF ignition delay is highly contingent on particle concentration,
with negligible changes observed within the 0.10–1.00 % w/w range
and a marked increase beyond 1.00 % w/w. Conversely, ignition
delay is reduced at concentrations lower than 0.10 % w/w. Addi-
tionally, the presence of oxygen in the nanoparticles and variations
in ambient pressure and temperature exert notable effects on ignition
behavior.

• CNF droplets can exhibit intensified puffing and micro-explosion
phenomena with a simultaneous decrease in micro-explosion fre-
quency. These heightened micro-explosions lead to improved sec-
ondary droplet ejection and enhanced atomization. In addition,
elevated ambient pressure can either suppress or facilitate micro-
explosions and puffing, depending on the specific conditions. Para-
doxically, carbon-based nanoparticles can also have a suppressing
effect.

• The burning period of CNF droplets is generally shorter than that of
base fuels due to a combination of factors, including an augmented
burning rate, intense micro-explosions and puffing, and reduced
liquid fuel concentration.

• the specific contribution of catalytic effects remains unclear Empir-
ical data indicates heightened combustion efficiency and increased
likely
flame stability in the presence of carbon nanoparticles,
resulting from a synergistic interplay between enhanced heat trans-
fer and potential catalytic reactions.

• Qualitatively, findings from droplet-scale experiments align with
observations made at the engine scale, emphasizing the potential of
CNFs to enhance engine performance, combustion characteristics,
and emission reduction.

11. Future research directions

To advance our understanding of carbon nanoparticle-based nano-
fuels (CNFs) and their practical applications, several critical research
directions must be pursued. Focusing on these areas is essential for
unlocking the full potential of CNFs in real-world combustion processes.

• Investigating the long-term stability of CNFs is crucial, particularly
to ensure they maintain stability over extended periods, ideally
around 12 months. This stability is fundamental to the commercial
viability of CNFs, as it affects their performance and usability in real-
world applications.

• While many studies have focused on the thermal and physical
properties of CNFs, attributing observed changes in combustion
behavior to these aspects, there is a notable lack of research on the
chemical properties of CNFs. Chemical properties are highly relevant
in combustion applications because they influence the reactivity,
combustion efficiency, and emission profiles of CNFs. Characterizing
these properties is essential to fully understand how CNFs interact
with base fuels and how they affect overall combustion dynamics.
• Experimental studies on CNF combustion across multiple scales have
utilized different ranges of particle concentrations. For engine-scale
studies, concentrations are typically below 1000 ppm, whereas
droplet and spray-scale studies often use concentrations ranging
from 0.01 % to 5.00 % w/w. It is important to conduct multiscale
experimental observations using consistent particle concentration
ranges to ensure the reliability and comparability of results.

• Exploring the characteristics of aggregate size and relative concen-
tration in base fuels is necessary to identify factors that could disrupt
CNF stability. Understanding these dynamics will aid in designing
CNFs that remain stable under diverse conditions, ensuring their
effectiveness and longevity in various applications.

• Time-scale analyses are needed to understand the formation of
detrimental aggregates and their impact on CNF performance. Such
research will provide insights into the mechanisms that affect CNF
stability and functionality over time, particularly in long-term
applications.

• Future research should address the lack of data on infrared (IR) ab-
sorption trends and combustion-relevant conditions in CNF droplet
studies. Many existing studies fail to replicate real combustion con-
ditions, such as the appropriate temperatures, pressures, and the
presence of combustion gases. Prioritizing experiments under these
realistic conditions, along with consistent particle concentrations
across multiscale studies, is essential to ensure that the conclusions
drawn are reliable and applicable to practical scenarios.

• The potential catalytic activity in CNF combustion warrants further
exploration. Although initial observations suggest catalytic effects, it
is crucial to recognize that the enhancements in combustion char-
acteristics, such as improved flame stability, increased burning ve-
locity, and reduced emissions, may primarily be attributed to the
improved heat transfer properties, including radiation absorption
and heat conduction, provided by carbon nanoparticles in the fuel
mixture. To fully understand and optimize the role of CNFs in com-
bustion processes, comprehensive experimental studies and detailed
chemical kinetic modeling are needed. These studies should aim to
distinguish between thermal enhancements and any catalytic con-
tributions, providing mechanistic insights that can clarify their spe-
cific impact on combustion efficiency and emission reduction.

• A comprehensive quantification of the relative contributions of
various heat transfer mechanisms is essential to accurately isolate
and understand their specific effects on CNFs combustion. This
detailed analysis will help distinguish the roles of conduction, con-
vection, and radiation in influencing the combustion characteristics
of carbon nanoparticle-based nanofuels.

• Investigating the influence of carbon nanoparticle-based nanofuels
(CNFs) on soot formation and exhaust particulate formation and
their interaction with soot and exhaust particulate during combus-
tion is essential for understanding their potential role in reducing
particulate emissions. This research is critical for advancing cleaner
combustion technologies and minimizing the environmental impact
of nanofuels.

• For droplet combustion or evaporation studies, it is important to
examine the effects of the support medium, including factors such as
fiber size, thermal conductivity, fiber arrangement, and the number
of fibers. These parameters can significantly influence the behavior
of nanofuels during combustion, yet they have not been thoroughly
investigated. Additionally, the impact of support fibers on initiating

puffing and micro-explosion phenomena requires further attention to
optimize combustion processes.

• Identifying or custom tailoring the most promising carbon nano-
particles for specific fuel additive applications offers a promising
direction. Tailoring CNFs to specific applications could maximize
their unique properties and enhance their performance.
