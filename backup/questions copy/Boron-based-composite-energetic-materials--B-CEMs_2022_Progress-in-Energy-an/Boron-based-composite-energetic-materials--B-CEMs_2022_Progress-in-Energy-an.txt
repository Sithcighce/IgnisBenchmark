Application

Metal fuels are attractive for solid/hybrid rocket propulsion and energy-conversion applications, because of their
(cid:0) 1) and volumetric heats of
high energy densities. Boron powder (B), due to its high gravimetric (58.30 MJ⋅kg
(cid:0) 3), is ideally one of the most promising fuel candidates for fuel-rich solid propellant
combustion (136.44 kJ⋅cm
(SP). However, from an application perspective, amorphous B has drawbacks of high ignition temperatures and
incomplete combustion, resulting in low energy-release rate and efficiency. Thus, there is growing interest in
employing  B-based  composite  energetic  materials  (B-CEMs)  in  SP,  explosives,  and  pyrotechnics.  The  present
work provides a comprehensive review of the advances made over the past few decades in the areas of prepa-
ration,  combustion,  and  applications  of  B-CEMs.  The  preparation  methods  of  various  types  of  B-CEMs  are
introduced, and the physicochemical properties of B-CEMs are systematically discussed particularly with regards
to  achieving  advantages  over  B  and  other  metal  powders  in  a  broad  range  of  applications.  The  ignition  and
combustion behavior of different energetic formulations with B-CEMs are reviewed. Finally, the existing prob-
lems and future challenges in our understanding of the field (prospects) are discussed.

1. Introduction

Metal fuels have long been of interest for propellants and explosives
because of their high energy density and high heat release when burned
[[1],[2]],  and  this  advantage  is  clearly  beneficial  for  volume-limited
propulsion  systems  [3–5].  Metals,  as  fuels  and  fuel  additives,  have
other  benefits  as  well,  such  as  mitigation  of  combustion  instability,
improvement  of  burning  rate,  reduction  of  sensitivity  to  detonation,
favorable  supply,  and  more  [[6],[7]].  Among  conventional  solid  pro-
pellants (SP) and hybrid fuels for aerospace exploration, boron (B) is an
important metalloid, and a promising fuel additive because of its high
(cid:0) 3) heats of
gravimetric (58.30 MJ⋅kg
combustion [8]. Fig. 1 compares the gravimetric and volumetric heats of
combustion  of  different  metals,  and  Table  1  provides  the  physico-
chemical properties of these metals and their corresponding metal ox-
ides.  Even  though,  the  mass  heat  of  combustion  of  beryllium  (Be)  is

(cid:0) 1) and volumetric (136.44 kJ⋅cm

(cid:0) 1  and 24.75 MJ⋅kg

higher than that of B, and the density of zirconium (Zr) and titanium (Ti)
are higher than that of B, but Be is toxic and the heat of combustion of Zr
and Ti are lower than that of B, and also they are not easy available. For
the common fuels, the heat of combustion of B is much higher than that
(cid:0) 1). In terms of energy
of Al and Mg (31.02 MJ⋅kg
(cid:0) 3) is the highest, while the density
storage, the density of Al (2.70 g⋅cm
(cid:0) 3). In terms of combustion, the melting
of Mg is the lowest (1.74 g⋅cm
and boiling points of Mg, Al, and B increase successively, as do com-
bustion  difficulties.  From  a  theoretical  perspective,  B  has  long  been
considered as the most attractive metal fuel additive. Despite this great
energy content, B has rarely achieved its potential in propulsion systems,
there are many factors that have made its implementation difficult.

Given  the  small  size  and  irregular  shape  of  B  powder  with  large
specific surface area (SSA), it is difficult to process significant amounts
of  B  powder  in  propellants  or  explosives,  which  is  not  conducive  to
tailoring  combustion  performance  [[11],[12]].  More  importantly,  a
native oxide layer of B2O3 with about 2–5 nm in thickness is coated on

they result  in better  particle  processability in  the propellant  formula-
tions [18]. Moreover, it has been proposed that by incorporating fluo-
rine  (F)  as  an  added  oxidizer  with  a  metal/metal  oxide  particle,  the
ignition  temperature  can  be  lowered,  and  reaction  rates  increased
[19–21].  More  recently,  B  powders  have  been  combined  with  fluori-
nated polymer, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), etc. to form composites
that achieve enhanced combustion performance in practical energetic
formulations [22–25]. Boron particles coated with Mg (or Al, zirconium
(Zr),  titanium  (Ti)),  when  substituted  for  conventional  Al  powder  in
propellants,  have  shown  significant  improvement  in  terms  of  the
burning rate of SP, and problems related to the formation of agglom-
erates  have  been  overcome  [26–29].  Fig.  2  shows  a  schematic  of  the
potential advantages of B-CEMs. Boron powder has been activated with
chemical compounds to improve propellant processability, shorten the
ignition delay time and increase the combustion efficiency of B, and to
promote B applications in propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics.

Because of the enormous potential of B as an energetic material, the
paper is organized first with a review of the methods of preparation of B-
CEMs,  followed  by  a  survey  of  their  properties  with  a  focus  on  their
ignition and combustion features. Applications of B-CEMs in SP, explo-
sives, and pyrotechnics are then reviewed, and finally, future directions
and the challenges of B research are discussed.

2. Preparation of B-CEMs

As a potential application to SP, B offers significant benefits, such as
increased  specific  impulse  of  propellants.  However,  the  impurities  of
B2O3  and H3BO3  on the B surface can undergo esterification reactions
with  the  terminal  hydroxyl  groups  of  hydroxyl-terminated  poly-
butadiene (HTPB) binder, which makes the preparation process of pro-
pellant  severely  difficult  [30],  increasing  the  apparent  viscosity  and
shortening  the  pot-life  of  the  slurry  [[31],[32]].  Moreover,  Boron,
because  of  its  high  melting  and  boiling  points  (2349  K  and  4274  K,
respectively [1]), oxidizes slowly though heterogeneous reactions on its
surface  [33].  To  accelerate  B  ignition,  B2O3  and  H3BO3  need  to  be
removed or reduced by using methods such as purification [[34],[35]],

the  surface  of  amorphous  or  commercial  B  (B0),  which  worsens  the
condensation reaction between H3BO3  and HTPB molecules with large
molecular mass polymer chain formation. Besides, B combustion often
leads  to HOBO with  less energy release, which  potentially  causes the
heat of combustion of B not to be released completely, as opposed to the
desired  liquid  B2O3.  Such  burning  characteristics  generally  result  in
relatively long ignition delays and burning times, particularly in com-
parison  to  metals  that  vaporize.  Hence,  for  volume  limited  systems,
often  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  high  theoretical  calorific  value  is
released [[13],[14]].

Several approaches have been used to diminish the processing dif-
ficulties of B powder, solve the ignition and combustion problems, and
raise the mass fraction of B and ultrafine oxidizer in propellants [[12],
[15]]. For example, organic fluoropolymers with typically low decom-
position temperatures are attractive candidate materials for passivation,
as  they  can  burn  in  many  practical  oxidizing  environments  and
contribute to the overall energy release [[16],[17]]. Another advantage
of organic coatings and organically coated small particles that have been
assembled into larger ones (by agglomerating or other means) is that

coated  to  spherical,  assembled/agglomerated  to  particles  of  larger  size,  inte-
grated with highly active energetic materials or polymers to improve the pro-
cessability of propellants, produce explosives slurry, shorten the ignition delay
time,  increase  the  combustion  efficiency  of  propellants  and  detonation  effi-
ciency of explosives, and improve the reactive activity of B particles, resulting
in increased heat output and improved reactivity.

coating  [[36],[37]],  agglomerate  formation  [38–40],  prills  [41],
incorporation  of  flammable  metal  powder  [42–44],  and  mechanical
milling  [[45],[46]],  which  plays  an  important  role  in  improving  the
processing performance of B-based propellants.

2.1. Purification and surface modification of boron powder

Amorphous  B  powder  purified  and  functionalized  by  ligands  and
organic chemicals is considered efficient for combustion and long-term
stability  [[47],[48]].  For  example,  when  oleic  acid  (OA),  tri-
octylphosphine oxide (TOPO), and cetyltrimethoxysilane were used as
purifying agents to B powder, the dispersion of purified B particles was
greatly improved [[49],[50]]. Trimethylol propane (TMP), a common
cross-linker and chain extender used in producing SP, can also react with
B2O3 and H3BO3 on the B particle surface. When purified B is used with
TMP, the incompatibility between B powder and other ingredients of the
propellant  is  eliminated.  However,  purification  with  the  above  com-
pounds produces less energetic materials.

The B2O3 on the B surface reacts with water to form the acid impurity
H3BO3  (B2O3  + 3H2O →  2H3BO3, H3BO3  + H2O →  [B(OH(4]
)
[[51],[52]]. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the pH of B. In several
studies, mannitol, TMP [50], triethanolamine (TEA) [50], sodium hy-
droxide  (NaOH)  [50],  ethanol,  and  distilled  water  [32]  were  used  to
purify B0. The particle surfaces of B0 are neutralized from acid to neutral
or weak alkalinity after surface purification, and the apparent viscosity
and  yield  stress  of  B/HTPB  mixture  increase  slowly  with  increasing
mixing time.

2.2. Boron-metal composite energetic materials

The ignition difficulty of B can be overcome, and the completeness of
oxidation and combustion of B can be increased by addition of rare earth
metals [53], Mg [54–56], and metal hydrides [57], etc.

2.2.1. B-Mg composite

Addition of Mg to B-based fuels improves B combustion [[26],[27]].
Thus, B-Mg composite, magnesium boride, B coated with Mg (B@Mg),
etc.  are  of  great  interest  as  energetic  additives.  As  an  example,  the
physicochemical  characteristics  of  B-Mg  composite  particles  were
determined, and the rheological properties of B/HTPB suspension were
evaluated [55]. Such studies have indicated that the viscosity and yield
stress  of  B-Mg  composite/HTPB  suspension  are  less  than  those  of  a
similar  suspension  of  B0/HTPB.  However,  the  density  of  propellants
containing B-Mg composites with high Mg percentage was lower than
that of B.

(cid:0) 3  and  2⋅47  g.cm

Magnesium borides (MgBx) such as MgB2, MgB4  have high heat of
(cid:0) 3  for  MgB2  and
combustion  and  density  (2.55  g⋅cm
(cid:0) 3) [58]. SEM character-
MgB4, respectively) compared to B (2.34 g⋅cm
ization of MgB2 and MgB4 was investigated and compared to ammonium
perchlorate (AP) coated B (B@AP) and lithium fluoride (LiF) coated B
(B@LiF) (Fig. 3). The prepared MgB2 shows hexagonal crystal structure
through  nucleation  and  crystallization,  while  the  crystal  structure  of
MgB4 is not complete, and only smaller cubic crystals can be observed.

2.2.2. B-Al composite

From an energy content perspective, B coated by Al (B@Al) and B-Al
composite are attractive research directions for propulsion and energy
conversion applications [59]. The morphology of B-Al composites pre-
pared by mechanical grinding method was investigated and compared
with those of spherical Al (5 μm diameter) and B0 powders (Fig. 4). For
the B-Al composite, there are many small flake powders on the surface of
aggregated Al particles up to 20 μm in diameter, whereas the B0 powder
is amorphous flakes 1–3 μm in size, and the Al powder consists of 1-5 μm
spherical particles with formation of few agglomerates [60].

2.2.3. B-Zr composite

Zr,  with  its  high  density  (6.49  g⋅cm

(cid:0) 3)  and  ease  for  ignition  has
attracted attention as an energetic additive. It can intermix exothermi-
cally  and  raise  the  particle  temperature  well  above  1273.15  K  when
combustion commences [61]. Zr burns in a condensed phase lowering
ignition  thresholds,  undergoing  heterogeneous  surface  oxidation/ni-
tridation  with  gas  phase  reactants,  as  well  as  rapid  phase  trans-
formations and micro-explosions [62]. In one example, B-Zr composites
that consisted of a Zr matrix with B inclusions mostly 100 nm or less in
size  with  the  composition  of  stoichiometric  ZrB2  were  prepared  by
high-energy  milling  in  a  shaker  mill.  The  ignition  of  the  prepared
composite revealed that Zr oxidation was the rate-controlling reaction in
the presence of O2. In fuel-rich environments, ignition of the composites
was affected by the reaction between B and Zr [63]. However, the high
heat of formation of ZrB2 makes the composite more difficult to burn and
reduces the heat of combustion of B.

2.2.4. B-Ni composite

Metal  fuels  such  as  Ni  can  reduce  the  temperature  required  for
ignition of B and have promoting effects on B combustion [[64],[65]].
Boron powder coated with a thin film of Ni (B@Ni) is an effective way to
improve  the  performance  of  B  containing  SP  [66].  By  forming  B@Ni
using chemical electroless nickel plating, it was found that a uniform Ni
coating on the B surface could be achieved, and with the Ni layer, the
combustion  performance  of  B  powder  can  be  effectively  improved  as
evident from DTA exothermic peaks analysis [67]. A compact micron-
and nano-scale coating structure of B@Ni with nano-size Ni (nNi) 21.7
nm  in  average  diameter  and  Ni:B=1:1  mass  ratio  was  synthesized  by
diamine  hydrate  reducing  nickel  chloride.  SEM  images  are  shown  in
Fig. 5 [68]. Compared to the irregular B powder, there are small parti-
cles aggregated and connected locally. The small particles with 20 nm
size  are  nearly  spherical,  and  the  thermal  conductivity  is  enhanced,
indicating the thermochemical behavior of the as-prepared B@Ni com-
posites is an improvement over that of the superfine B powder [69].

B@Ni particles with 10–120 nm Ni in diameter were also prepared
by  facile  electroless  Ni-deposition  through  four  different  paths:  no
rinsing and no drying (Path-A), only drying (Path-B), both rinsing and
drying (Path-C), and only rinsing (Path-D) at room temperature (Fig. 6).
Results have shown that the crystalline nNi formed was well distributed
on the B surface. The average particle size of the nNi in samples A, B, C
and D is slightly different with 100, 50, 70, and 15 nm, respectively.
During thermal analysis, a lower exothermic peak temperature occured
and  a  greater  heat  evolution  for  B@Ni  particles  compared  to  B  was
observed [70].

2.2.5. B-Ti composite

Regarding the inherent limitations in reaction rate and incomplete
oxidation elemental B powder, one approach to improve B combustion is
based  on  metastable  composites,  such  as  B-Ti,  which  are  capable  of
highly exothermic metal-metalloid reactions [71–73]. For example, B-Ti
composites with irregular and spherical particle shapes were prepared
by arrested reactive milling in the presence of hexane and acetonitrile
(Fig. 7). The prepared powder with bright surface for B-Ti composites
represents the Ti matrix, whereas dark inclusions represent B particles.
Spherical particles appear to include multiple small pores.

One point needs to be noted: TiB2 can be oxidized during ball-milling
preparation,  which  is  gradually  accelerated  with  the  increase  of  ball-
milling time. However, with addition of alcohol as a medium and with
argon protection, oxidation can obviously be decreased [74].

2.2.6. Other B-metal composites

In addition to the metals mentioned above, iron (Fe), cobalt (Co),
hafnium (Hf) have been used as dopants to improve the properties of B.
In one instance, B-Fe composite and B-Hf composite with 95:5 mass ratio
were prepared  by  high-energy mechanical  milling  in a  planetary mill
using hexane as a process control agent (PCA). Other B-Fe composites

were prepared using acetonitrile and stearic acid as PCAs. Agglomerates
were observed for milled particles, appearing to be more rounded and
compact  compared to  B,  which  appear as  fractal  aggregates. A broad
range  of  aggregate  sizes  was  noticed  for  all  samples,  while  a  smaller
number of ultrafine particles were observed for B-Hf. The bright ultra-
fine inclusions, representing the added metals, are uniformly dispersed
in B aggregates as shown in SEM images (Fig. 8) [75].

In another instant, several types of B (B99 with 99% purity, B95 with
95% purity, and Bw B95 washed with acetonitrile) were doped with five
weight percent Fe by thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl. The
doped  prepared  samples  showed  no  significant  morphological  differ-
ences  compared  to  corresponding  B.  Compared  to  amorphous

aggregates of B95, B99  includes distinguished crystal shapes as well as
amorphous particles, whereas larger and flake-like agglomerates appear
in Bw [76].

2.3. Boron/metallic oxide composite energetic materials

The  oxidation  of  B  by  metal  oxides  (Bi2O3,  CuO,  Fe2O3,  Al2O3)  is
another important mechanism that can improve B combustion perfor-
mance [[78],[79]]. For example, considering the B2O3  shell (~30% of
the mass), 60 nm diameter B particles with Bi2O3 were mixed and son-
icated in hexane for 30 min, and then dried in a hood overnight allowing
hexane to evaporate to prepare B/Bi2O3 composite. With pure Bi2O3, B

could be ignited at a temperature as low as 793 K [80]. For nano-B/NiO
composite, the reaction temperature is 303 K lower than that of B [81].
For  nano-B/CuO  composite  prepared  through  chemistry  precipitation
method, a thin nano-CuO layer coated the B surface [82].

Several other B/metallic oxide composites have been prepared using
different methods [83–86]. Nano-B/CuO with 2:3, 8:3, and 32:3 in mole
ratios  and  nano-Al/B/Fe2O3  composites  were  prepared  using  the
ball-milling  method.  B/Fe2O3/RDX  composites,  with  a  mass  ratio  of
2:8:90, were prepared by sol-gel method and dried by supercritical CO2
fluid drying technology. B/nano-Fe2O3/nitrocellulose (NC) composites,
with the mass ratios 10:3:0.65, 10:5:0.75, 10:8:0.9, and 10:10:1, were
prepared  by  the  electrostatic  spray  method.  The  prepared  B/metallic
oxide composites were uniformly mixed but partially aggregated. Boron
powder  is  found  in  the  regular  structured  composites  with  porous

surfaces, and gaps (interstitial spaces) in the microspheres is filled by
many superfine particles. Compared to raw RDX, the heat of reaction of
the B/Fe2O3/RDX composite tested by DSC at N2 with the heating rate of
(cid:0) 1.  Mechanical  sensitivities,  such  as
10  K⋅min
characteristic drop height (H50) and friction sensitivity tested according
to Ref. [87], increased from 20.5 cm (RDX) to 40.8 cm and decreased
from 100% to 72%, respectively.

2.4. Coating B composite energetic materials

Coating B is an effective way to improve the B surface morphology
and lower the apparent viscosity and lengthen the pot-life of B-based
propellant  slurry  [[32],[88]].  Moreover,  coating  may  assist  in
improving the ignition and combustion performance of B [89].

2.4.1. B coated by polymer binders

Several polymers have been proposed to coat B to protect B against
premature oxidation and enhance combustion properties [90–92]. For
example,  B  powder  coated  with  HTPB  (B@HTPB)  by  direct  reaction
coating method. Benzene was used as a solvent. Esterification of HTPB
was performed at 354 K for 14 h, and TDI, as the solidification reagent,
was  introduced  for  solidification  treatment  at  344–354  K  [93].  A
transparent  membrane  formed  around  the  B  particle,  which  can  be
considered as HTPB. At the same time, B powder was coated with sty-
rene maleic anhydride copolymer (SMA) [94] where it was found that
the dispersion of B powder in HTPB was improved due to the increased
particle size after coating.

Glycidyl azide polymer (GAP), an energetic binder, can increase the
performance of a SP. Boron particles were coated with GAP (B@GAP) to
improve  B  combustion  characteristics.  The  coating  process  was  per-
formed using a facile solution process with an iso-propyl alcohol (IPA)/
dimethylformamide (DMF) mixture having a volume ratio of 10:1 [95].
Transmission  electron  microscope  (TEM)  images  of  B@GAP  and
B@GAP-Ag (B@GAP decorated with 10 nm diameter Ag particles) pre-
sented in Fig. 9 reveal that GAP uniformly coats the surface of B parti-
cles.  GAP  coatings  can  also  make  the  particles  stable  against  air
oxidation.  Unlike  B@GAP,  there  is  no  electron  beam  damage  for

Fig. 9. TEM images of GAP-coated B (B@GAP) and Ag-decorated GAP-coated B
(B@GAP-Ag) particles. (Reproduced from [95] with permission).

B@GAP-Ag particles suggesting the chemical structure of soft GAP was
changed to a hard material. However, Ag was not recommended to be
used because of its toxicity and non-energetic contribution.

Considering reactivity with the acidic impurities on the surface of B
particles,  3,3-bis(azidomethyl)  oxetane  and  tetrahydrofuran  copo-
lyether (PBT) was used as a coating agent by using the direct reaction
and  solvent  evaporation  process  in  which  the  hydroxyl  group  of  PBT
reacts with B2O3 on the B surface. B@PBT has been shown to reduce the
viscosity  of  propellant  slurry  [90].  In  addition,  B@NC  microspheres
containing 3%, 5% and 10% of NC were prepared by the electrostatic
spray method [73]. Many fibers were distributed on the surface of the
agglomerated B@NC microspheres, and the interstitial spaces in the B
microspheres were filled with NC (Fig. 10).

2.4.2. B coated by oxidizers

Oxidizer coatings can decrease water absorption on B surfaces and
improve the thermal oxidation of B [[96],[97]]. B@AP particles were
prepared by means of the extraction method. After AP coating, AP mi-
crocrystals can be seen on the surface of B particles, and the regularity of
B  particles  is  improved  (Fig.  3e).  The  apparent  heat  release  from  a
propellant  with  B@AP  increases  by  12.6%  compared  to  that  of  an
equivalent propellant with an equal amount of physically mixed B-AP
[98]. B@AP was also prepared by the solvent evaporation method using
(cid:0) 1)
methanol or acetone as the solvent (the vaporizing rate was 10 g⋅h
with  the  B  pretreated  by  amido-silicon  alkyl  to  produce  fine  coating
layers  [[99],[100]].  For  comparison,  TEM  images  of  B@AP,  B@PBT,
B@HTPB, and B@LiF are illustrated in Fig. 11, and compared with that
of B without coating [101]. As evident from the coated particles, it can
be seen there is the transparent layer on the B particles.

Besides,  lithium  perchlorate  (LiP),  like  AP,  are  strong  oxidants,
which can promote combustion and enhance the heat release of B. In one
study, B@AP/LiP composite (B 20%, AP 36%, LiP 44% in mass fraction)
was prepared by the hydrothermal recrystallization method in deionized
water at 60–90
C [102]. Results showed that AP and LiP closely cover
the B surface due to the uniform mixing between molecules and to the
uniform  dispersion  of  oxidant  samples  (Fig.  12).  In  comparison  with
mechanically mixed samples, B@AP/LiP composite effectively reduces
the  diffusion  resistance  of  oxygen  to  B  and  promotes  the  combustion

2.4.3. B coated by fluorinated compounds

The reaction between LiF and B2O3  forms a low-boiling-point com-
plex that accelerates the B/O reaction [[103],[104]]. The LiF helps to
eliminate the B2O3 oxide layer and form a low melting point complex to
promote the ignition of B particles according to the reaction: B2O3(l) +
LiF(s,l) → LiBO2(g) + BOF(g) [88]. Thus, B powder was proposed to be
coated by an agent with fluorine. For example, surface coating of B with
LiF (B@LiF) was prepared via the reaction between LiOH and HF (LiOH
(aq) + HF(aq) → LiF(s) + H2O(l)) using the neutral precipitation method
[23]. To synthesize in situ B@LiF composites, LiOH and NH4F were used
as precursors, and Fig. 13 presents the setup for gas-liquid two-phase
flow  coating  to  prevent  particle  coalescence.  Boron  powder  was
dispersed  in  LiOH  solution  uniformly  under  ultrasonic  and  agitating

phase flow method. (Reproduced from [88] with permission).

actions, then a high-pressure gas stream was introduced to impact the
NH4F solution, and thus small droplets were formed in suspension. After
crystallization of the droplets, B@LiF powder was obtained [88].

The morphologies of B0, LiF, B@LiF particles and physically mixed B-
LiF  particles  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  14  [88].  LiF  particles  with  smooth
surfaces were overlaid on the rough surface of B particles to yield B@LiF
aggregates.  The  median  diameter  of  B@LiF,  approximately  10  μm,  is
larger than that of the B powder. The crystals film on the B surface is
compact  and  well  distributed  on  the  B  powder  surface  with  25  nm
thickness. The EDS characteristic peak of B almost disappears for B@LiF
(Fig. 14e), indicating LiF was well coated and dispersed on the surface of
B particles [105].

Viton-A

(vinylidene  fluoride/hexafluoropropylene  co-polymer,
C5H3.5F6.5) is also a promising candidate for coatings because the igni-
tion and combustion of metal particles can be improved with the fluo-
rine that is contained within the polymer (66.5% by mass). For Viton-A
coated B (B@Viton-A), the reaction of B2O3 with water and the forma-
tion of acid substances, which are not conducive to the solidification of
propellant, can be prevented. The reactions [[1],[106]], HF + B2O3 →
BOF + HOBO and 6HF + B2O3 → 2BF3 + 3H2O, are those that assist in

the removal of the oxide layer to improve ignition behavior.

2.4.4. B coated by other compounds

In addition, B with nano-sized dimension has considerable influence
on the morphology of coated particles. For example, B@BiF3 composites
with  90/10,  70/30,  and  60/40  B  to  BiF3  mass  ratios  and  B@Bi  com-
posites with 92/8 and 69/31 B to Bi mass ratios were prepared by high
energy milling (Fig. 15g–k). Mass ratios of 50:50 B@BiF3  and B@CoF2
formed  porous  structures  with  60  min  wet  milling  (Fig.  15a–f).  The
coated particles are shown in Fig. 15a–f where B appears dark gray, and
the  heavier  metal  fluorides  are  seen  as  bright  phase  particles  or  in-
clusions. The coatings consisted of a thin, discontinuous fluoride layer
with a few larger agglomerations. Boron particles with 100 nm dimen-
sion appear to be coated with a thin fluoride layer, with additional nano-
sized  fluoride  particles  embedded  in  somewhat  porous  agglomerates,
and the coating appears to be more uniform for B@CoF2 composite. As
shown in Fig. 15g–k, boron appears medium gray, BiF3 or Bi additives
are bright, and the carbon mounting tape appears as a dark background.
Both BiF3 and Bi are distributed homogeneously within the B aggregates
on a scale of several μm, and occasional free unattached BiF3 or Bi was
found in all composites.

As noted for the coating materials mentioned above, one approach
includes coating B with a large number of small coating agent grains,
such as nitroguanidine (NQ), which can decrease B ignition and com-
bustion times [108]. During B reactions with B2O3 and diffused O2, NQ
helps to breakdown and remove the oxide film by producing gases and
releasing heat. The generated decomposition products further promote
the oxidation of B by enabling reactions between B and the NQ inter-
mediate  products.  Once  the  oxidation  film  is  completely  removed,  B
comes into direct contact with O2  and burns in the combustion stage.
Another  approach  includes  coatings  with  saturated  hydrocarbons  or
fatty acids, such as oleic acid (OA) as a means to coat B particles [49].
Reactive milling of B in OA solution was shown to improve the reactivity
of  B.  Developing  new  methods  to  obtain  metal  particles  coated  with
chemical substances that can further improve the properties of particles
is a great challenge [6]. Thus, B particles with 800 nm mean diameter
were coated by OA in hexane or by cerium oxide (CO) in hexane through
the high-energy ball milling technique. Boron particles would be well
dispersed  in  liquid  hydrocarbon  fuels  and  crushed  during  milling  to
facilitate the fresh un-oxidized B surface to bind with OA and CO to yield

B@OA and B@CO particles [109–111]. Generally, B after being coated
with  ionic  liquids  (ILs)  could  prevent  B  from  air  oxidation,  and  its
long-term stability could be enhanced. So, three types of ILs, B@MAT
[DCA]  (1-methyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium  dicyanamide),  B@BMIM
[DCA]  (1-butyl-3-  methylimidazolium  dicyanamide)  and  B@DCIL
(dicationic ionic liquid), were used to produce composite coated parti-
cles  during  ball  milling  [112],  where  it  was  found  that  B@ILs  nano-
particles could provide energetic groups and also oxidation stability.

2.5. Agglomerated B composite energetic materials

Agglomeration or granulation of B powder with bigger particle size is
an effective way to improve the performance of B and B-based propel-
lant  [113–115].  For  example,  the  agglomerated  B  with  controlled

particle  size  prepared  by  the  mechanical  milling  method  based  on
preparation  parameters  optimization  [116],  and  HTPB  (as  polymer
binder) and AP (as combustion promoter) were added to the composi-
tion. After agglomeration, the particle size increases, the particle shape
is  nearly  spherical,  and  the  particle  surface  is  smooth  [1].  The  rela-
tionship between the surface roughness and particle size distribution of
the agglomerated boron particles (ABPs) with the fractal dimension (D)
and the rheological properties of propellant slurries were investigated in
Refs. [[117],[118]]. The D of various ABPs range from 2.55 to 2.90, and
it  is  affected  not only  by  the  preparation  technology, but  also by  the
amount  of  agglomerating  agent,  collision,  and  stirring  speed.  The
smaller median particle size was found to cause larger fractal dimension
and finer grained agglomerated B. On the contrary, the larger the me-
dian diameter, the smaller the fractal dimension of the coarser grained

agglomerated B.

In  another  example,  agglomerated  B  with  good  roundness  in  the
particle size range from 105 μm to 190 μm was prepared by a spray dry
method (Fig. 16) [92]. Results indicate that the density of agglomerated
B  increased  with  increasing  stirring  speed  of  a  centrifuge  during  the
agglomerating process. The particle size at a rotational speed of 750 rpm
was  smaller  (120  μm)  than  the  particle  size  at  350  rpm  (220  μm).
Spherical B particles with 4–100 μm particle size range were prepared
with hexane and acetonitrile as the process control agents in a planetary
ball mill. Experiments  showed that the prepared  spherical B particles
exhibited a higher bulk density and much better flowability than com-
mercial  B  powder.  The  spherical  B  particle  size  decreased  with
decreasing amounts of acetonitrile, while it increased with the milling
time, number of milling balls, and speed of milling [119]. Agglomerated
B and NC with a particle size ranging from 50 μm to 500 μm was pre-
pared by using the water suspension method. Results showed that the
(cid:0) 3) of the obtained “nearly spherical” agglom-
bulk density (1.05 g⋅cm
erated  B  particles  with  smooth  surface  was  higher  than that  of  the  B
(cid:0) 3).  After  introduction  of  NC,  the
agglomerated  with  HTPB  (0.9  g⋅cm
oxidization  weight of  B  at  1268  K  in  TGA  test  increased  by  8%–27%
[120],  and  the  storage  of  agglomerated  B  with  NC  has  been  demon-
strated for six months [36].

The density of agglomerated B particles can influence the propellant
density. So, the density of agglomerated B particles should be increased
as much as possible during the agglomeration process [121–123]. In one
instance, ABPs with different particle size and mass fractions in fuel-rich
propellant were prepared, and size grading and density tests were con-
ducted with various B/binder mass ratios based on a theoretical calcu-
lation [118]. It was found that the density of B improved significantly
after  agglomeration,  and  the  most  obvious  density  improvement  was
achieved by the particle size grading distribution. Compared to B0, the
yield stress (τ) and viscosity (ηs) could be reduced significantly for the
large  particle  sizes  of  ABPs,  ascribing  to  B  agglomeration  and  the

near-spherical  shape  of  particles  [[124],[125]].  Additionally,  the
surface-functionalized  B  with  nonpolar  oleoyl  chloride  in  B(40  wt
%)/HTPB composite exhibits a 63.3% higher Young’s modulus, 87.5%
higher tensile strength, 16.2% higher toughness, and 16.8% higher heat
of combustion than B (40 wt%)/HTPB [126].

2.6. Boron-based nano-sized composite energetic materials

It  is  widely  known  that  the  reactivity  of  metal  particles  increases
when particle size decreases [45]. Significant improvements in ignition
and combustion behaviors of propellants, such as faster burning rates
and  shorter  ignition  delay  times,  have  been  attributed  to  the  use  of
nano-sized metal particles, including nano thermite, nB/carbon nano-
tube, nB/graphene etc. [127–132]. For nB, the ignition delay time de-
creases, and the completeness of combustion increases as compared to
corresponding  micron-size  particles  [[7],[133]].  For  instance,  the
oxidation  and  energy  release  of  nB  could  be  improved  by  in  situ
nonthermal plasma technology, the oxide layer on the surface of nB in
70 nm diameter was reduced by a nonthermal hydrogen plasma treat-
ment, followed  by  argon plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(PECVD)  using  perfluorodecalin  (C10F18)  at  near  room  temperature
(Fig. 17). A 2.5 nm thick passivation coating on the surface of B was
detected, and PECVD coating provided excellent passivation against air
and humidity for 60 days [134].

Recently, high-energy ball milling, with the advantage of passivation
in combination with chemical reactions, was applied to fabricate nano-
structured metal particles coated with organic compounds [135–137].
For  example,  nB  was  modified  by  3-aminopropyl  triethoxy  silane
(KH-550) in ethanol (B/KH-550/ethanol=1/10/16 in mass ratio), and
B-NC  (B  16.7  wt.%)  nanofibers  were  prepared  by  means  of
electro-spinning method [138]. The B/NC nanofibers with an average
diameter of 350 nm have smooth surface, loose structure and uniform
particle size. Due to the addition of the amino functional coupling agent

KH-550, the dispersion of B powder in the fiber and in B/NC nanofibers
is  improved.  From  TGA/DTA  experiments,  the  constant  pressure  and
volume combustion rate of B/NC fibers is higher than that of the B-NC
physical mixture. The initial oxidation temperature in TG/DSC experi-
ments was reduced by 294 K when ethanol and NaOH were used as the
mixed solution during wet milling [139]. The thermal oxidations in air
of B-NC nanofiber were compared with that of B0, B-NC mixture (B 16.7
wt.%). The oxidation reaction between B powder and air becomes more
complete, and the energy release is larger with an increase in dispersion
uniformity of B and in SSA of B-NC mixture, due to the high SSA of the
small particle size [140].

3. B-CEMs in SP

The  ignition  and  combustion  properties,  condensed  combustion
products features, and possible combustion models of B-CEMs of interest
in solid propulsion are examined.

3.1. Oxidation of B-CEMs

As is widely known, Mg ignites more easily than B, and because of its
exothermicity, the addition of Mg can promote the ignition and com-
bustion  of  B  powder  and  increase  heat  release  at  lower  temperatures
[[141],[142]].  TG-DTA  experiments  have  been  performed  for  a
comparative  analysis  of  the  thermal  oxidation  of  B@AP,  B@LiF  and
B@Mg. When temperature reaches 895 K for B@LiF, an exothermic peak
appears, accompanied by significant mass increase. As the temperature
continues to rise to 1000 K, the sample has a sharp oxidation mass in-
crease, which is the main exothermic peak of B oxidation, whose tem-
perature is significantly lower than that of pure B (1053 K) and B@AP
(1074 K). The main thermal oxidation peak temperatures of B@Mg with
8% Mg (973 K) and B@Mg with 15% Mg (978 K) are much lower than
that of B@AP and B@LiF, revealing the enhanced reactivity of B in the
presence  of  Mg  [35].  Besides  Mg,  Ti  combined  with  B  to  form  B-Ti
composite is attractive for its thermodynamic features. B-Ti and 2B•Ti
composites were prepared in Ref. [72] and their gravimetric and volu-
metric heats of oxidation are compared to Al in Fig. 18. It was found that
the thermal oxidation of B-Mg mixture with the Mg to B mole ratio equal
to 1/2 occurs through a two-stage process. The temperature range and
shape of the exothermic peak of the first stage are close to the oxidation
and melting processes of Mg powder, during which the mass increases
by 27.5%. The mass of the second stage of oxidation increases by 82.7%,
which results from B oxidation [35].

The thermal oxidation performance of B can be promoted by coating
the particle, and the burning rate of coated particles increases linearly
with increasing contact surface of B particles with an oxidant per unit
volume of fuel, as is described in [143]. The degree of participation of B
in  the  AP  pyrolysis  reaction  was  investigated  by  means  of  thermal
analysis of AP, B, and their mixture [[51],[144]]. It was found that for

Fig.  18. Theoretical  heats  of  intermetallic  reaction  in  prepared  composite
powders  as  well  as  heats  of  oxidation  for  both  the  prepared  composites  and
aluminum. (Reproduced from [72] with permission).

B@AP, increasing the superfine AP proportion can promote the extent of
B reaction, enhance the heat release during pyrolysis, and increase the
heat of explosion of the propellant. On the one hand, AP addition de-
creases the initial temperature for B oxidation and produces substantial
amounts of H3BO3, B2O3, and HOBO after the complete decomposition
of AP. On the other hand, the oxidation of B releases a large amount of
heat and promotes reaction. Consequently, the optimal B:AP mass ratio
with high heat release was 40%. The heat release rate of B@AP increases
evidently with decreasing diameter of B particles in the composites, and
the highest heat release rate of B@AP containing superfine B powder
(d50  = 0.3 μm) was up to 28.4 times greater than that of B@AP com-
posite  containing  B0  with  d50  = 3.4  μm,  which  may  be  due  to  the
chemical reaction between B and NH3  in mannitol modified B, or the
physical  adsorption  of  NH3  on  the  surface  of  B  powder  [145–147].
Moreover, the fluorine materials improve the activity  of B powder as
was evident from studies on the thermal decomposition of B@Viton-A,
B@PVDF,  and  B@PTFE  composites  that  were  prepared  by  solvent
evaporation  [24].  Viton-A  reduces  the  oxidation  temperature  of
micron-scale B powder by 306 K and lowers the oxidation temperature
of nB by 289 K. Even though PVDF and PTFE have negligible effect on
the activity of nB powder, PVDF improves the activity of micron-scale B
powder and reduces its oxidation temperature by 321 K, whereas PTFE
reduces the activity of micron-scale B powder and increases its oxidation
temperature by 290.4 K.

Boron  composites  with  oxidizer  are  known  to  be  beneficial  to  B
oxidation. For example, AP, HMX, KNO3 and KClO4 were combined to B
to form B/oxidizer composites, respectively, the heat release of the four
(cid:0) 1  from
composites  measured  by  DSC  at  the  heating  rate  of  10  K⋅min
high to low was [B/KClO4] > [B/KNO3] > [B/HMX] > [B/AP], indi-
cating  that  a  strong  oxidation  reaction  exists  between  KClO4  and  B
[148]. To enhance the performance of B/KNO3 (BPN), sintered B/MgB2
(1:1.8 mass ratio) (S-B/MgB2) was prepared by introducing Mg to B (1:7
mass ratio) and sintering the system at 1073 K in Ar. It was noticed that
S-B/MgB2  had  the  advantages  of  a  high  thermal  stability  and  heat
release,  and  S-B/MgB2/KNO3  (sBPN)  attained  over  90%  heat  release
efficiency in an oxygen bomb, compared to that of 53.34% for B [[149],
[150]].

the  melting  of  B2O3,  whereas

Moreover, reports [[107],[151]] indicate that addition of BiF3 and Bi
to B can enhance the reaction rate of B0. The initial exothermic peak
(723  K)  coincides  with
the
high-temperature exothermic shoulder (790 K) becomes more intense
for increased quantities of BiF3 in B⋅BiF3 composites. The largest gain in
mass  (59%)  was  shown  for  a  90%B⋅10%BiF3  sample,  whereas  a  92%
B⋅8%Bi sample revealed the greatest shift of peak exothermicity occurs
at lower temperatures. In single particle combustion experiments in air,
the 90B⋅10BiF3 composite burns faster than B0, while the burning times
for  95B⋅5BiF3  composite  are  not  significantly  different  from  those
measured for B0. Table 2 summarizes the effect of B@LiF on the heat of

detonation,  heat  of  combustion,  and  energy  release  during  primary
combustion and after-burning processes of two propellants; the heat of
combustion  and  heat  of  detonation  test  methods  are  provided  in
Ref. [152]. The results indicate that the propellant with B@LiF had a
faster  oxidation  reaction  at  873  K,  and  that  a  greater  amount  of  B
participated in B/O reaction (an increase of 39.9%) in comparison to the
propellant with B0. Both the primary combustion efficiency (ηc1, %) and
after-burning energy release efficiency (ηc2, %) of the propellant con-
taining  B@LiF  increased.  The  combustion efficiency  of  B  (ηB,  %) was
enhanced significantly from 65.48% to 81.57%, due to the reduction of
the  surface  B2O3  layer  via  endothermic  reaction  of  LiF  with  B2O3  at
elevated temperature and the acceleration of the B/O reaction. B@LiF
reduces the oxidation temperature of B, whereas B@AP improves the
oxidation of B in oxygenated environments.

Besides  types of  B-based composites, the smaller  particles had the
larger measured heat of combustion. During determination of the heat of
combustion  of  B,  the  double  base  lead-2  propellant  as  a  combustion
agent was introduced to provide a higher environmental temperature in
which the B could combust. The heat of combustion of B/combustion
agent  mixtures  in  an  oxygen  bomb  calorimeter  increases  when  B  is
substituted  for  the  alumina  coating  that  naturally  covers  aluminum
[153].

For halogen addition to B, the onset temperatures for oxidation of
coated B with Br and F were found to be 289–344 K higher than that for
B0. 960 mg B particles 1 μm diameter in size were coated with 40 mg of
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 59 wt% F), Viton (66 wt% F), and tet-
rafluoro  ethylene-hexafluoro  propylene-vinylidene  fluoride  (TFE-HFP-
VDF, THV, 72 wt% F). B@THV provided the highest average improve-
ment in heat of oxidation and in reactivity (in terms of pressure gener-
ation and combustion temperature) followed by B@Viton and B@PVDF
[154]. B/PVDF/Al composites of 1~5 μm diameter were prepared using
80 nm B0 doped with 50 nm Al by electrospraying of 10 wt% PVDF as
binder. The combustion and energy release of B/PVDF/Al is promoted
due to the PVDF reaction with B2O3 on the surface of B. Al reduces the
ignition energy of B/PVDF/Al, allowing it to burn stably in air [155].

3.2. Ignition performance of B-CEMs

The  presence  of  B2O3  layer  on  the  B  particle  surface  hinders  the
permeation of ambient oxygen, making ignition difficult, and leads to
long  ignition  delay  time,  and  low  combustion  efficiency,  which  is
detrimental to B performance in ramjets and other propulsive applica-
tions [156–158]. The improvement of ignition performance of B can be
achieved by controlling its particle size, surface coating, and adding low
ignition point metals. It was discovered that the ignition delay time of
B@GAP powder is reduced, and the combustion efficiency is increased
[159]. Since GAP is energetic binder that releases heat during decom-
position, it can significantly improve the energy release of a propellant
and  is  also  greatly  beneficial  to  the  improvement  of  the  combustion
behavior  of  B  [160].  For  instance,  under  a  N2  pressure  of  0.34  MPa,
fuel-rich  propellants with  B@GAP particles  have  been  shown to burn
violently, and the amount of residual agglomeration on recovered pro-
pellant surfaces after burning decreases. When the GAP mass fraction
increased  from 0% to  9.2%, the  propellant burning rate  increased by
86%,  and  the  ignition  delay  time  of  B@GAP  was  greatly  reduced

compared with that of uncoated B.

The ignition temperatures of B@Mg with 5 wt.%, 8 wt.%, 12 wt.%,
and 20 wt.% of Mg in air and pure oxygen at ambient pressure have been
investigated [161] using a laser ignition system (Fig. 19) [56]. A spec-
trometer (AvaSpec-2048, Netherlands Avantes BV Co.) and high-speed
camera  (Phantom  V  7.2)  were  employed  to  record  the  ignition  and
combustion  process.  The  laser  beam  was  reflected  and  afterwards
focused by a convex lens to heat the samples. To get more time-resolved
spectrum and photographs, the integration time of the spectrum was set
to 1.05 ms, and the sampling rate of the high-speed camera was 5000
pfs. Ignition results indicate that in oxygen the B ignition temperature
(470  K)  was  lower  than  that  in  air,  that  B@Mg  had  a  significantly
decreased ignition delay time, and that the Mg coating accelerated the
burning  of  B.  The  ignition  delay  time  of  B@Mg  (8  wt.%)  was  28.4%
lower than that of B0.

AP,  LiF,  and  TMP were used for  coating  the B  surface  to improve
ignition  behavior  [162].  The  reaction  of  B  in  air  was  found  to  be
comprised  of  a  two–stage  process:  an  exothermic  reaction  and  an
endothermic reaction. LiF and TMP were found to decrease the ignition
temperature  and  increase  the  heat  release  of  B,  whereas  AP  slightly
raises the ignition temperature. In addition, the ignition delay times of B,
B@AP10  (10  is  the  percentage  of  coating  material,  here  and  below),
B@LiF10,  and  B@TMP10  during  laser  ignition  [163]  showed  that  AP
decreases the B ignition delay time under fixed irradiation by 7.35 ms,
and strengthens the combustion of B [164–166].

The ignition temperatures determined by using a heated filament for
different  composites  and  particle  sizes  are  compared  in  Fig.  20  [72].
Oxidation  for  spherical  powders  started  at  lower  temperatures
compared to the irregularly shaped composites of B and Ti. For spherical
powders,  independent  of  composition  or  average  particle  size,  the
ignition occurred around 773 K. In contrast, the irregularly shaped B-Ti
and  Ti⋅2B  composites  ignited  between  893K  and  933  K  and  at  lower
temperatures than for pure Ti. All composites exhibited exothermic re-
actions at lower temperatures when heated than Al and Ti (1083 K), in
both inert and oxidizing environments.

As mentioned above, the addition of BiF3 and Bi to B can enhance the
reaction rate. For example, B@BiF3 and B@Bi composites were prepared
by  mechanical  milling  and  the  ignition  behavior  was  examined  in  a
thermal  analyzer  in  an  oxygenated  environment  [21].  The  filament
ignition  temperatures  of  B@BiF3  and  B@Bi  composites  and  the  laser
power threshold required to ignite these composites were investigated
(Fig.  21)  [107].  Ignition  temperatures of  860–880 K  for  60B@40BiF3
and 70B@30BiF3  samples were similar whereas a higher temperature
(930 K) of the heat source was required for ignition of 90B@10BiF3 at
low  filament  heating  rates.  In  addition,  it  was  observed  that  the  pre-
pared composites containing 2.14 wt.% of fluorine facilitate oxidation
decreasing  the  B  ignition  temperature  in  air.  For  60B@40BiF3  and
70B@30BiF3 the ignition temperature increases with increasing heating
rate while no reliable ignition was recorded at relatively high heating
rate  for  90B@10BiF3  [107].  Additionally,  the  threshold  laser  power
decreases with increasing amount of fluoride additive. The ignition laser
power thresholds for aerosolized particles placed into the focal point of a
CO2  laser at room temperature in air were obtained from experiments
with varied laser power. In the case of pure B, the ignition power was
highest with a value of 8.75 W, while in the case of the 60B@40BiF3, the
power was lowest with a value of 3.75 W.

In another experiment [107], B@BiF3 and B@CoF2 composites were
prepared by using coating technique, and high-speed video frames have
been  used  to  investigate  the  ignition  performance  of  B@BiF3  and
B@CoF2 composites on an electrically heated wire at heating rates close
(cid:0) 1 by observing the bright particles which detached from the
to 3000 K⋅s
wire. The evaluation of the ignition temperature value was obtained via
extrapolation of the filament temperature record to the instant in time
corresponding to ignition under the assumption of constant heating rate.
The  exothermic  reaction  kinetics  and  ignition  temperatures  were  not
dependent on the type of fluoride for commercial B-based composites,

example,  the  ignition  and  combustion  performance  of  ternary  Al⋅B⋅I2
and Mg⋅B⋅I2 composites containing 20 wt.% of iodine prepared by me-
chanical milling were characterized. The relationships between burning
time  vs.  particle  size,  and  ignition  temperature  vs.  heating  rate,  were
obtained (Fig. 22). The combustion temperatures of ternary composites
were lower than the temperatures for pure Al and Mg because of the
presence of iodine. In the case of Mg⋅B⋅I2, the ignition temperatures were
lower  than  those  for  Al⋅B⋅I2,  and  the  burning  times  of  Mg⋅B⋅I2  were
shorter than those for Al⋅B⋅I2 for the same particle size [168]. Similarly,
B-based thermites containing an iodine concentration of 57.6 wt.% with
a particle size ranging from 1 to 10 μm were prepared mechanochemi-
cally.  For  two  systems  studied,  the  average  temperature  of  the  heat
source  required  for  ignition  for  C-B60I40-4-Ca(IO3)2  was  574  ± 29  K
versus 645 ± 28 K for B-Ca(IO3)2 [169–171].

Factors such as B particle size, crystalline form, purity, etc. need to be
considered when evaluating ignition performance. Particles of B0 have a
shorter  ignition  delay  time  than  that  of  crystalline  B  [[172],[173]].
Crystalline B particles with average diameters of 34.5 μm and 44.2 μm
were ignited in the post flame zone of a flat-flame burner at gas tem-
peratures that were varied over the range of 1800–2900 K [174]. Boron
particles were introduced in a stream of combustion products generated
from carbon monoxide/oxygen or propane/oxygen flames via a hypo-
dermic  needle  using  helium  as  a  carrier  gas.  Results  indicated  no
noticeable dependence of ignition temperature on the particle size or gas
temperature. At the same time, a notable trend of decreasing ignition
temperature was revealed with an increase in the ambient water-vapor
concentration, which may indicate the promoting role of water vapor in
B ignition by reducing the oxide layer. A polymorphic phase change in
crystalline B was considered as a possible triggering ignition mechanism
[166].  This  assumption  may  explain  a  constant  ignition  temperature
(about 1774 ± 344 K) and the independence of ignition temperature on

different  composite  powders  and  for  elemental  metal  powders.  (Reproduced

whereas they were dependent on the type of fluoride when using washed
B in acetonitrile-based composites. The temperature of the heat source
required  for  ignition  of  B@BiF3  was  lower  than  that  required  for
B@CoF2 [21]. Both B@BiF3 and B@CoF2 composites burn faster than B
in air, and B@BiF3  composites had shorter burning times compared to
those of B@CoF2 in air [167].

Iodine bearing reactive materials capable of decreasing the temper-
ature  of  the  heat  source  required  for  ignition  of  B  and  B-based  com-
posites  serve  as  promising  additives  to  energetic  formulations.  For

oxidizer concentration.

In other studies, it was found that increasing pressure, decreasing B
content (or increasing AP content) in B@AP decrease the ignition delay
time of HTPB/AP/Al/B fuel-rich propellants (solid mass fraction is 70%)
when using a CO2  laser at atmospheric and sub-atmospheric pressures
with 117 W/cm2 heat flow rate [[175],[176]].

3.3. Combustion features of B-CEMs

The ignition and combustion processes of B have been explained to
occur through two-stages, where the first stage involves B reacting while
being protected by an oxide layer when the reactants must diffuse across
this  layer  slowing  oxidation  and  the  second  stage  involves  the  oxide
layer removal at higher temperatures and the condensed-phase B reac-
tion occurring directly with oxidizers in the surrounding gas [177–179].
The  combustion  efficiency  of  B  can  be  increased  in  the  case  of  small
particle  size  or  in  the  case of  combustion  of  B particles  embedded in
oxidizer  [131];  the  combustion  mechanism  of  B  was  explained  by
thermochemical aspects [180]. Moreover, the use of light metal addi-
tives in B-CEMs, such as Mg and Al, has been proposed to improve B
combustion efficiency [181–183].

3.3.1. Effect of B-Mg on the combustion of B-CEMs

One method proposed for combustion improvement involved B2O3
removal  by  incorporation  of  Mg  to  gain  additional  early  heat  release
[[27],[44]]. The effects of Mg coating on combustion of B particles were
investigated in [184]. During the initial combustion stage, Mg is more
likely reacting and releasing heat that leads to a temperature increase
around B particles. At elevated temperatures, Mg can react with B2O3 to
remove  the  oxide  film  on  the  B  surface  and  reduce  its  ignition  delay
time. Using such particles with different Mg content, the burning rates of
SP were measured and the B2O3 and total B contents in the combustion
residues were determined by the method of chemical titration [185]. It
was found that the B2O3  content in the combustion residues from pro-
pellant burning increases with increasing Mg content in the propellant,
indicating that Mg can promote the B oxidation reaction. The burning
rate  and  pressure  exponent  of  HTPB/AP/B/Mg  (30/33/37  in  mass
fraction) fuel-rich propellant containing B-Mg (32:5 in mass) evaluated
according to Ref. [55] are higher than those of pure B propellant. The
pressure exponent of the fuel-rich propellant is increased by only 0.05
over  the  pressure  range  of  0.5–3.0  MPa,  the  heat  of  combustion  is
increased  by  2.8%,  and  the  heat  release  from  combustion  is  also
increased  by  3%.  These  trends  may  be  due  to  the  participation  of  B
powder in the condensed phase reaction during the primary combustion

of fuel-rich propellant [[9],[186]].

The ignition and combustion performance of B, separate B-Mg blends
(B:Mg  = 92:8,  particle  size  ≤ 25  μm)  and  B-Mg  composite  (Mg  8%,
particle size ≤0.5 μm) powders were investigated by using an oxygen
bomb  calorimeter  and  laser  ignition  test  bench  [187].  Results  have
shown  that  B-Mg  composites  improve  the  degree  of  oxidation  and
reduce the reaction temperature of B significantly. The ignition delay
time and heat of combustion for B-Mg composite, B-Mg blends and B
(cid:0) 1,
were  18  ms,  79  ms,  404  ms  and  23.455  MJ⋅kg
(cid:0) 1, respectively. It is assumed that Mg on the surface of
19.967 MJ⋅kg
coated  B  reacts  with  B2O3  to  form  B  at  high  temperature,  reducing
ignition  delay  time  of  B  particles,  and  improving  B  combustion
efficiency.

3.3.2. Effect of B-Al on the combustion of B-CEMs

Substitution of neat aluminum by B-Al mechanical alloy decreases
the  agglomerate  size  and  relative  mass  of  coarse  particles  in  the
condensed-phase  combustion  products  of  typical  propellants  (24%  of
polyvinyl tetrazole polymer plasticized with nitro ester; 18% of Al in 6
μm or B-Al mechanical alloy in 8 μm; 20% or 40% of HMX; 38% or 18%
of AP) [[42],[188]]. Additionally, when replacing Al by B-Al alloy, the
flame temperature at atmospheric pressure increases and the pressure
exponent decreases from 0.6 to 0.47 over the pressure range of 2–8 MPa
for a propellant containing 20% of HMX. For a propellant containing
40% of HMX, the pressure exponent decreases from 0.7 to 0.5 (Fig. 23).
The combustion characteristics of B-Al and B-Mg mechanical alloys
strongly  depend  on  size  distribution  of  the  original  particles,  mixing
ratio, and milling regime. The replacement of Al in propellant formu-
lations by B-Al mechanical alloy resulted in a decrease in the ignition

delay  time  of  investigated  propellants  and  changed  both  the  burning
rate  and  the  characteristics  of  condensed-phase  combustion  products
(CCPs)  [[189],[190]].  It  was  found  that if  B-Al  was  used  as  a  fuel  in
HTPB  propellants,  the  burning  rate  was  increased  by  40%  and  com-
bustion residue mass was reduced by 20% compared to the propellant
containing pure B [8]. The ignition and combustion characteristics of
B-containing composites, such as B-Mg, B-Li and B-A1, were explored.
Compared with pure B, the times for ignition delay and combustion for
B-containing  composites  became  shortened,  indicating  their  better
combustion performance and higher combustion efficiency than that of
B powder [188]. At the same time, TGA analysis has shown that B4C
lowers the initial oxidation temperature and promotes the ignition and
combustion  of  B  powder  [191].  As  the  content  of  B4C  in  the  sample
increased, the ignition delay time became shorter, and the combustion
rate became faster [192]. For B-based metal alloys, the essential factors
that affect the combustion characteristics are the B content in the alloy
and the alloy particle size, which depends on the raw material particle
size and production milling regime [193].

3.3.3. Effect of B-Ti on the combustion of B-CEMs

The  exothermic  solid–solid  reaction,  2B  + Ti  →  TiB2,  generates  a
significant amount of heat, which accelerates the oxidation reactions of
B.  Nano-sized  Ti  (nTi)  powder  can  also  be  used  to  improve  the  com-
bustion performance of B [194]. The arrested reactive milling process
has been used to prepare nano-sized B-Ti composites. Their ignition and
combustion  performance  in  aerosol  form  was  investigated  and
compared  with  that  for  blended  B  and  Ti  powders  of  the  same  bulk
composition, and for blended Al. Experiments [195] were performed in
a constant-volume explosion vessel filled with N2/O2/CH4 mixtures. The
volumetric oxygen concentration was fixed at 22.5% and the methane
concentration was varied from 0 to 12%. The combustion temperature of
nano-sized  B-Ti  composite  increased  from  2180  to  2370  K  as  the
methane concentration increased from 0 to 12%. The order of burning
rates from high to low was nano-sized B-Ti composite, Al and blended
B-Ti powder. The presence of HOBO, which potentially causes the heat
of combustion of B not to be released completely, was not detected in the
reaction products when the B-Ti mixture was burned in a wet air envi-
ronment.  It  was  concluded  that  the  use  of  nano-sized  B-Ti  composite
allows  achieving  high  combustion  performance  in  either  dry  or  wet
gaseous environments.

3.3.4. Effect of B-other metal on the combustion of B-CEMs

Besides  the  B-metal  composites  discussed  above,  the  effect  of  Fe
doping on various purity B (B-Fe) was studied with particle ignition by a
CO2 laser and combustion in air [77]. Boron with 95% purity doped with
Fe  burned  faster  and  at  a  higher  temperature  than  non-doped  B;  the
effect appeared to scale with the amount of Fe present. The increase in
the  burning  rate  and  temperature  caused  by  Fe  serves  as  a  shuttle
catalyst that is oxidized by external O2 and then reduced by B. From the
combustion investigation of 5% of Fe doped on the surface of 95% pure
B in various oxidizing environments (H2O, a mixture of CO2, CO, and
H2O, and air), the burning B-Fe composite produced single-peak emis-
sion pulses in all oxidizers. The overall emission intensity produced by
the composite was lower than that of B [196]. The correlations between
the  burning  times,  t,  and  particle  sizes,  D,  for  different  powders  are
shown in Fig. 24. The smaller particles have shorter burning times, B99
(99% pure B) had shorter burning times compared to B95 particles, and
B95  washed with acetonitrile did not significantly affect combustion in
air. The burning time vs. particle size trend was substantially shorter for
B95  doped  with  Fe  than  for  B99,  particularly  for  larger  particles.  A
similar reduction in the burning times was observed for B washed with
acetonitrile (Bw) and Bw doped with Fe [197].

Furthermore,  the  combustion  performance  of  B-Fe,  B-Hf,  B-Co
composites  was  conducted  by  introducing  them  into  the  combustion
products of a pre-mixed air-acetylene flame or a diffusion air-hydrogen
flame as well as igniting them in air with the use of a CO2 laser beam. It

and higher combustion efficiency than B powder [189]. For instance, the
combustion  behavior  and  combustion  mechanism  of  borides  at  high
temperatures were systematically investigated [199]. Emission spectra
data showed that during pure B combustion, a continous emission signal
at 546 nm was detected indicating the existence of BO2. For combustion
of MgB2, the early portion of the flame development was dominated by
Mg combustion, which switched to B-dominated combustion later in the
flame. The combustion time of Mg boride was the shortest among the
tested  samples  at  the  same  experimental  conditions.  The  propellant
combustion efficiency (i.e., the ratio of measured heat of combustion to
theoretical value) of propellants containing borides was higher than that
for  propellant  containing  pure  B,  with  the  combustion  efficiency  of
propellants with Mg boride being the highest among all propellants at
0.5  MPa  [200–203].  The  heat  of  explosion  of  propellants  containing
B@Mg,  MgB2,  MgB4  and  B@LiF  was  higher  than  that  of  propellant
containing  B.  Mg  borides  can  elevate  the  burning  rates  of  B-based
fuel-rich  propellant  significantly,  while  organic  boride,  B@LiF,  and
B@Mg only elevate the burning rate to a moderate extent (Fig. 26) [36].
Furthermore, the combustion of propellants containing MgB2 and MgB4
is  more  prone  to  exothermic  oxidative  reaction  near  the  surface,
allowing more of the heat released to feed back to the burning surface
from the gas phase reaction zone, thus promoting the thermal decom-
position reaction in the propellant condensed phase. Moreover, a linear
relationship was established between the heat of explosion and the final
flame temperature, the same as in the case of weight loss during pro-
pellant decomposition and gas evolution. In the process of heating up,
the  boride  compounds  undergo  endothermic  decomposition.  Even
though the decomposition of organic boride is endothermic, the oxida-
tion reaction can release a significant amount of energy [8]. The com-
bustion  efficiency  of  B  in  MgB2  and  MgB4  were  62%  and  48%,
respectively,  higher  than  that  of  B  (38%).  Compared  to  B,  complete
oxidation of Mg boride could be achieved at lower temperature.

was found that a positive effect of Hf as an additive is noticed in different
oxidizing environments; adding Hf leads to the most significant accel-
eration  of  combustion  among  all  composites.  Adding  Fe  leads  to  an
improved burning rate in air, whereas there was no clear advantage in
other  oxidizing  environments.  When  acetonitrile  and  stearic  acid  are
used  as  a  process  control  agent,  both  greater  refinement  of  Fe  and
stronger acceleration in the burning rates of prepared composites in air
occurred [75].

B-metal composites not only show the superior reaction features but
also contribute to the tunable burning rate of SP. B-Mg, B-Fe, and B-Mo
composites  in  9:1  mass  ratio  were  prepared  by  employing  the  ball
milling  method.  There  was  an  accelerating  effect  on  the  thermal
decomposition of the SP, especially for B-Fe. After adding B-Mo and B-
Mg  composites,  the  burning  rates  became  51.0%  and  24.8%  faster,
respectively, than that of SP (Fig. 25). The burning rates of SP containing
B-Fe in open air and in a closed bomb were 60.4% and 139% faster than
that of SP, respectively. The multiple oxidation states of Fe enable it to
be  an  attractive  candidate  as  a  dopant  in  propellants,  which  exhibits
superior activity in the oxidation of B and decomposition of AP [198].

Mg borides (MgB2 and MgB4) have better combustion characteristics

increases the heat release in the low temperature range of propellant
pyrolysis. When the oxidizer content in fuel-rich propellant containing B
is constant, replacing AP with the same fraction and particle size of KP
can improve the ignition performance and decrease the pressure expo-
nent in the burning rate law [204]. Furthermore, B@AP and B@LiF have
the effect of increasing the burning rate of the propellant at low pres-
sures  and  decreasing  the  low-pressure  deflagration  limit,  both  being
favorable for decreasing the pressure exponent in the burning rate law.
The effects of coatings on sub-micron sized B (~ 0.8 μm) with AP, KP, LiF
and  Mg on  the burning rate  performance of  propellants were investi-
gated [[111],[205]]. Coating with AP was found to increase the contact
area between AP and B, which is conducive to enhancing exothermic
reactions  between  the  gas-phase  species  produced  during  thermal
decomposition of AP and B. The heat released is fed back to the burning
surface,  promoting  thermal  decomposition  reactions  within  the  pro-
pellant  condensed  phase,  yielding  a  burning  rate  higher  than  that  of
formulations with uncoated B. In comparison to uncoated B, the com-
bustion temperature increases by over 474 K with B@AP or B@KP, and
the burning rate increases by 36% in an atmospheric environment for
B@KP and B@LiF [[206],[207]].

B@AP  can  serve  as  the  oxidizer  instead  of  O2  during  the  ignition
stage, and the coating can improve the contact between B@AP particles
and oxygen released by AP decomposition, increasing the burning sur-
face  temperature  and  flame  temperature,  thus  enhancing  the  heat
transfer during the ignition stage [[97],[98]]. From comparison of the
performance of B@NQ with that of B@AP, NQ coating has the better
effect on ignition and combustion times and combustion intensity. With
NQ,  the  average  ignition  time  and  combustion  time  of  B@NQ  are
decreased by 35% and 53%, respectively [163].

(cid:0) 1 at heating rates of 5, 10, and 15 K⋅min

In the case of B@LiF, the reaction temperature of B@LiF is reduced
compared to B. Closed bomb experiments indicate that LiF improves the
combustion efficiency and increases the combustion completeness of B
forming oxyfluorides such as OBF as opposed to forming the commonly
desired liquid B2O3. B@LiF has also been shown to effectively reduce the
propellant  ignition  delay  time,  and  improve  the  combustion  residue
dispersion [[162],[208]]. For example, when 4% of B@LiF was added to
replace  the  same  fraction  of  Al  in  an  underwater  explosive  (HTPB
12%/Al 25%/AP 43%/RDX 20%), the heat release was 6727, 7280 and
(cid:0) 1, respectively, which
3109 J⋅g
was  greater  than  that  in  formulations  without  B@LiF.  Moreover,  the
activation energy of the secondary combustion reaction for the explosive
containing B@LiF was decreased by 28.9% as calculated via Kissinger’s
method. Furthermore, the explosive impact sensitivity with B@LiF was
significantly lower than that of the underwater explosive with pure B. At
low pressure, a moderate content of B@LiF increases the burning rate of
propellants while high contents (6.25%) of LiF coating have a negative
effect on the pressure exponent in comparison with lower contents of LiF
(2.78%)  (Table  3)  [209].  An  explanation  may  be  that  the  reaction
B2O3(l) + LiF(l) → LiBO2(g) + BOF(g) reduces the diffusion resistance
for  [O]  generated  by  AP  decomposition,  which  is  conducive  to
increasing B oxidation and heat release, and the oxidizers combined to B
improve  the combustion of B over  higher pressure  ranges [[1],[210],
[211]]. For the propellants with B@LiF, LiF reacts exothermically with
B2O3 on the B particle surface and removes the oxide layer, facilitating
the  exothermic  oxidation  of  B  particles  and  increasing  the  thermal
feedback to the propellant surface [[8],[212–214]]. The ignition delay
time  of  HTPB/AP  fuel-rich  propellant  with  B@LiF  versus  B  without
coating reduced from 70.5 s to 23.6 s by CO2 laser ignition method with
10.6  μm  wavelength,  indicating  that  the  burning  efficiency  of  B  in
fuel-rich propellant was improved by LiF coating [23].

In  the  case  of  B@Mg,  the  addition  of  Mg  effectively  reduces  the
initial  temperature  for  oxidation  of  B  powder  and  enhances  the  B
oxidation rate. The inclusion of B@Mg is favorable for formulations of B-
based fuel-rich propellants, but it is necessary to protect particles against
premature oxidation [27]. The resulting high combustion temperature
of  the  primary  zone  of  these  burning  propellants  provides  a  suitable

high-temperature  environment  for  the  combustion  of  B  powder.  As  a
result,  the  energy  release  efficiency  of  B  powder  is  promoted  signifi-
cantly by the addition of Mg powder [189]. For instance, the addition of
Mg powder makes the combustion reaction and flame of B powder more
intense, indicating the combustion process of B@Mg more severe than
that of B0.

The  combustion  behavior  of  B@GAP  was  investigated  experimen-
tally at atmospheric pressure by injecting the particles into the hot post
flame  zone  of  a  flat-flame  burner,  which  used  premixed  propane-
oxygen-nitrogen  gases,  and  compared  to  that  of  pure  crystalline  B
[215]. It was found that B@GAP with mass ratios of B:GAP equal to 1:0.3
and 1:0.6 can improve the ignition and combustion completeness of B.
An optimal mass ratio of B to GAP in the range of 1:0.3~1:0.4 was found
experimentally  by  examining  the  combustion  residue  and  quenched
burning surface. B@GAP-based fuel-rich propellants demonstrate higher
burning  rates  and  lesser  extent  of  agglomeration  than  the  uncoated
baseline  propellant.  The  ignition  delay  time  of  B  particles  could  be
significantly shortened with the use of GAP coating. The main reasons
are explained as follows: (1) the azide group in GAP can generate sig-
(cid:0) 1) when it decomposes, which can
nificant heat (313.8 - 397.5 kJ⋅mol
increase the temperature and promote B particle ignition and combus-
tion; (2) water in the decomposition products of GAP can react with the
oxide film: B2O3(1) + H2O(g) → 2HOBO(g) and 3B2O3(1) + 3H2O(g) →
2H3B3O6(g). These reactions remove the oxide film from the surface of B
particles and promote B ignition.

In comparing performance of B@AP, B@GAP and B@LiF/AP (with
double layer), it was found that B@AP and B@LiF/AP can be ignited at
870 K and 861 K, respectively, which was much lower than that of un-
coated B (1574 K). The combustion efficiency of propellant with coated
B, either in air or O2, is much higher than that of uncoated B, and the
combustion efficiency is the highest for B@LiF/AP compared to B@GAP
and B@AP [94].

Experiments have been performed on the combustion of B@Viton-A
with 2 μm mean particle diameter of B powder in a ducted rocket, and
results  were  compared  with  those  of  propellants  containing  B@LiF,
B@silane, and uncoated B [106]. The burning rate of B@Viton-A was
slightly  lower  than  those  of  B@LiF  and  B@silane.  A  separate  laser
ignition  experiment  revealed  that  the  propellant  with  B@LiF  had  the
shortest ignition delay time, while the propellant with B@Viton-A had
the longest ignition delay time under the same heat flux. Since an in-
crease  in  the  amount  of  LiF  coating  increases  the  time  for  B  particle
heating to the ignition temperature, the coating thickness of LiF should
not be too high.

B@CFx  (fluorinated  graphite)  can  effectively  improve  the  burning
rate  and  pressure  exponent  of  fuel-rich  propellants.  For  example,  the
effects of B@CFx with different F contents (x = 0.08, 0.25, and 1.17) on
the combustion of B-based fuel-rich propellant (28% AP, 8% Mg alloy,
27% HTPB, and 37% agglomerated B, CFx:B = 1:14 and 1:7 mass ratio,
with a small amount of polymethyl methacrylate, PMMA, of 300-, 600-,
850-,  and  1180  μm  size)  were  experimentally  investigated  [216].
Reducing the AP particle size and using coarse B particles was found to
be most beneficial to increase the burning rate and reduce the pressure
exponent of fuel-rich propellants. This is because the graphite fluoride
can  produce  active  F  in  the  process  of  thermal  decomposition.  In
agglomerated  particles,  graphite  fluoride  is  in  direct  contact  with  B,
which  is  conducive  to  the  reaction  of  active  F  with  the  oxide  layer
promoting the ignition of B particles. For other coated particles, such as
B@NC mentioned before, the burning rate of the propellant with B@NC
microspheres  is  higher  than  that  of  the  propellant  with  original  B
powder  and  it  increases  rapidly  with  the  microspheres  content.  In
addition, the combustion efficiency of B particles that were 10–150 nm
in  diameter,  passivated  with  F  by  gas  phase  pyrolysis  of  decaborane
(B10H14) and treated via Br and XeF2  method, was greater (75%) than
that of conventional B particles (50%) [[217],[218]].

3.3.7. Effect of B agglomeration on the combustion of B-CEMs

The addition of ABPs to fuel-rich propellant can affect the burning
rate and the propellant pressure exponent. It has been shown that when
the  mass  ratio  of  B  powder  to  ABPs  is  1:2,  the  pressure  exponent  of
HTPB/AP/B fuel-rich propellant over the pressure range 0.5–3 MPa is
the highest (0.40) [219]. Another study has shown that the processing of
fuel-rich propellant becomes less difficult when spherical ABPs particles,
with  a  size  range  of  0.105–0.19  mm  size  prepared  through  the  spray
drying method, is introduced to replace B0, thus making higher B con-
tents more attainable [220]. The effects of ABPs, with different particle
size,  content,  and  coating  agent  on  the  combustion  characteristics  of
B-based fuel-rich propellants has been experimentally explored [[221],
[222]]. In these studies, the low-pressure deflagration limit decreased
with  an  increase  in  ABPs  particle  size,  and  the  trend  of  the  pressure
exponent  was  to decrease as  well. The burning rate of the  propellant

increased with increasing ABPs content, which could be explained by
the Beckstead-Derr-Price (BDP) multi-flame model [223]. The heat of
explosion  (Qv)  and  the  flame  temperature  (Tf)  also  increased  with
increasing B content [12].

The combustion evolution of B powder with time has been observed
with high-speed camera at atmospheric pressure, where B particles were
used  individually  as  loose  powder  and  ignited  by  using  a  CO2  laser
[148]. A green color flame was observed characteristic of BO2 emission
during B combustion. Both the flame area and the B/Mg (92/8 in mass
ratio)  flame  brightness  were  greater  than  found  for  95%  purity  B
(Fig.  27).  The  combustion  intensity  of  B@AP  and  ABPs  was  stronger
than that of B0, with the combustion intensity of ABPs being higher than
that  of  B@AP,  suggesting  that  the  combustion  of  B  and  other  fuel
components  in  the  agglomerates  occurred  simultaneously  while  B
combustion in coated particles lagged behind the combustion of other
components.

Based  on  theoretical  calculations,  it  was  proposed  to  use  F  as  an
oxidizer addition to improve the reaction rate and combustion perfor-
mance of B [224–229]. Additions of Al2O3, MgO to B reduce the activity
of  B  during  its  ignition  and  combustion  processes  in  SP,  while  the
addition of MgF2 contributed to lowering the ignition temperature and
shortening the ignition delay time in the oxidizing medium due to the
formation  of  gas  phase  B  fluoride  and  reduction  of  the  mass  of  B2O3
[22].  Meanwhile, acetonitrile  washed B was  mechanically milled and
combined with BiF3  or CoF2; the ignition sensitivity of the powders to
electrostatic  discharge  was  found  to  be  low.  The  exothermic  reaction
kinetics and ignition temperatures of such powders were affected by the
type of fluoride agent: the reaction and ignition temperatures of BiF3
were lower than those of CoF2 [[107],[230]].

In addition, a coating layer of alkane or alkene molecules (carbon
atom  number  less  than  5)  with  low  molecular  weight  can  inhibit  B
powder oxidation  and agglomeration during storage and  improve the
combustion performance of B powder [12].

3.3.8. Effect of B/metallic oxide on the combustion of B-CEMs

Metal oxides, such as Bi2O3, CuO and NiO doping to B have a sig-
nificant effect on the combustion behavior and increase the combustion

performance  of  the  propellant  compared  to  B  without  metal  oxides
[[78],[79]]. For instance, the ignition temperatures and the reactivity of
various  B/Bi2O3  composites  were  evaluated  by  the  methods  of  rapid
heating (> 105 K/s) temperature-jump/time-of-flight mass spectroscopy
and  confined  pressure  cell.  The  higher  oxygen  vacancy  and  smaller
metal-oxygen bond energy of Bi2O3 lead to lower ignition temperature
and  higher  combustion  reactivity  [80].  The  enhanced  ignition  and
combustion characteristics of B/CuO, B/Bi2O3  and B/CuO/Bi2O3  com-
posites  were  demonstrated  by  using  the  laser-induced  air  shock  from
energetic  materials  (LASEM)  technique.  CuO  and  Bi2O3  enhance  the
energy release from B on both microsecond and millisecond timescales.
CuO and Bi2O3  are the most  effective oxidizers for ignition and com-
bustion of B compared to those of MoO3, Co3O4, and Fe2O3. CuO acts as
an  intermediate  which  enhances  intermixing  and  reduces  diffusion
distances between B and Bi2O3  in B/CuO/Bi2O3, and the binary oxide
mixture (75 wt.% B/CuO + 25 wt.% B/Bi2O3) is more effective than all
the single metal oxides for the ignition and combustion of B particles
[[231],[232]].

The effects of three types of B/CuO composites (B:CuO = 2:3, 8:3,
32:3 in mole  ratio) on the combustion performance of Mg/PTFE  pro-
pellants (1#: m(Mg):m(PTFE) = 7:3, 2#: m(B):m(Mg):m(PTFE) =2:5:3,
3#: m(B/CuO, 2:3): m(Mg): m(PTFE) = 2:5:3, 4#: m(B/CuO, 8:3 in mole
ratio):m(Mg):m(PTFE)  = 2:5:3,  5#:  m(B/CuO,  32:  3  in  mole  ratio):m
(Mg): m(PTFE) = 2:5:3) have been experimentally demonstrated [83].
Compared with Mg/PTFE propellant without B or B/CuO (1# sample),
the  linear  and  mass  burning  rates  of  Mg/PTFE  propellant  containing
B/CuO (5# sample) were increased by 25.6% and 3.1%, respectively.
When compared with Mg/PTFE propellant containing pure B (2# sam-
ple),  the  linear  and  mass  burning  rates  of  Mg/PTFE  propellant  con-
taining B/CuO composites (5# sample) decreased by 2.1% and 19.5%,
respectively, and the average combustion temperature and the highest
combustion  temperature  decreased  by  368  K  and  395  K,  respectively
(Fig. 28).

In another study, the combustion performance of Mg/PTFE propel-
lant was measured by adding B/NiO composite to it and compared to
one with B at 0.1 MPa. Results have shown that the burning rate of the
B/NiO-Mg/PTFE propellant increased by 22.8–25.2 %, the mass burning
rate  increased  by  26.7–30.8 %,  and  the  combustion  temperature
increased by 8–56 K compared to the B-Mg/PTFE propellant [81]. The
combustion  characteristics  of  Mg/PTFE  propellant  with  addition  of
B/CuO  composite  (Mg/PTFE:B  or  B/CuO  is  10:1  mass  ratio)  were
characterized by a 12.9% increased burning rate, 13.5% increased mass
burning rate, and 329.5 K increased combustion temperature compared
to Mg/PTFE propellant with B [82]. At the same time, the combustion
behavior of B/PTFE mixtures containing 10–40% mass fraction of B was
examined;  the  mixtures  with  10%  of  B  readily  extinguished  upon
removal  of  supplemental  oxygen  flow,  while  those  with  40%  of  B
showed self-propagation after ignition [[233],[234]].

As mentioned, B/Fe2O3/NC composites prepared were found to have

reduced oxidation temperatures and improved reactivity compared to B
alone. When these composites were added to HTPB/AP propellant, the
propellant burning rates were enhanced [86]. For example, propellants
containing 8% mass fraction of B/Fe2O3/NC composite had a burning
rate  2.77  times  higher  than  that  for  the  same  propellant  without  the
composite  when  burning  in  air.  The  catalytic  effect  of  B/Fe2O3/NC
composite  on  accelerating  the  thermal  decomposition  of  HTPB  com-
posite  propellant  increased  with  an  increase  in  the  mass  fraction  of
Fe2O3 in the composite.

Additional  to  the  metal  oxides,  the  energy  release  of  B  can  be
increased by doping nTiC, nZrC, and nSiC-mediated to B. The ignition
delay  times  were  shortened,  and  the  maximum  surface  temperature
significantly decreased after adding the nanocarbides [235]. Moreover,
the mixture of functionalized graphene or graphite materials can be a
new  class  of  promising  additives  for  metal  combustion.  A  mixture  of
graphene oxide (GO) and graphite fluoride (GF) is a new and effective
additive  for  B  particles.  The  combustion  characteristics  of  B/GO/GF
mixtures (80/10/10 wt.%, the nominal diameter of GO is 0.5-5 μm and
the thickness is 0.8-1.2 nm, the nominal diameter of GF is 4-10 μm) were
investigated  in  a  laser  ignition  experiment  and  compared  to  that  of
B/GO (80/20 wt.%) and B/GF (80/20 wt.%) mixtures. It was found that
B/GO/GF had the shortest ignition delay time, longest burning duration,
and strongest BO2 emission among all tested samples with laser duration
0.5  s operation in a continuous mode and  the laser flux level  50-400
W/cm2. These enhancements are caused by synergistic effects such as
the  release  of  heat,  gases,  and  fluorocarbon  radicals  that  facilitate  B
ignition and combustion [236].

3.4. Condensed-phase combustion products analysis

Particle size analysis of CCPs is of great significance for the evalua-
tion  of  B-CEMs  combustion  efficiency  [237–242].  B@GAP  has  been
discussed to improve the  ignition behavior, and  it also has a positive
effect on the residue dispersion performance of B-based propellants. For
example, when 9.2% GAP was used to coat B particles, the combustion
agglomerate fraction for size greater than 45 μm decreased from 0.68 to
0.61  at  1  MPa,  and  the  total  residue  percentage  also  decreased.  The
combustion  residue  with  small  particle  size  was  mainly  a  mixture  of
carbon and unreacted B, whereas the residue with large particles (≥ 45
μm)  was  mainly  a  mixture  of  B4C,  BN2,  Mg2B2O5  and  MgB4,  and  the
content of MgB4 increased with increasing GAP content. Fig. 29 shows
SEM  photographs  of  combustion  residues  of  B-based  HTPB/AP/B/Al
propellants containing coated and uncoated B (30%) [243]. The com-
bustion  solid  residue  from  propellants  with  B@GAP  is  much  less
agglomerated than that from the counterpart with uncoated B powder.
The combustion residue of uncoated B propellant is seriously caked, and
a sizable number of flakes and recondensed Al powder are on the surface
of residue particles.

combustion products with the stronger effect from PCTFE [248].

As  previously  discussed,  the  combustion  efficiency  of  coated  B  is
improved,  especially  in  the  case  of  B@LiF.  The  combustion  residue
analysis  of  B-based  fuel-rich  propellant  with  B@LiF  shows  the  molar
ratio  of  B  to  B2O3  in  propellant  combustion  residue  decreased  from
37.5:1 for uncoated B to 3.1:1 for B@LiF at 1 MPa [103].

According to Glassman’s criterion [136], if the temperature of metal
boiling exceeds that of its oxide, the combustion process is localized on
the particle surface, as in the case of Si, Zr and B. It is known from the
comprehensive review [8] that B ignition is complicated by the presence
of B2O3 liquid layer on the particle surface at temperatures between the
melting and boiling points of its oxide (723–2316 K). To better under-
stand the ignition process in mixtures with hydrogen, it is necessary to
consider the reaction of B2O3 (liq.) with water vapor to form HOBO [12].
Theoretical models of B particle combustion can be divided into two
types. One is  the semi-empirical type models, including the King and
PSU models [[226],[229],[249],[250]]. For King’s model, combustion
was assumed to occur by diffusion of environmental oxygen through the
oxide  layer  to  the  B–B2O3  interface  and  subsequent  reaction  with  B.
While for the PSU-model, the diffusion of dissolved B through the oxide
liquid layer and its subsequent reaction with environmental oxygen was
assumed
comprehensive
Princeton-Aerodyne (PA) model, dealing with an elementary (vs. global)
detailed  chemical  mechanism,  which  was  proposed  by  the  Prince-
ton–Aerodyne research group [226]. There are currently several draw-
backs of the PA model, such as the lack of experimental data for many
fundamental input parameters, uncertainty of formation enthalpy in B
compounds, and its expensive application in a computational fluid dy-
namics  code.  However,  it  has  identified  reaction  steps  and  physical
processes  that  require  further  study  for  model  improvement  and
fundamental understanding. There have since been variations made to
the simpler PSU-model [[225],[228],[251]]. Special attention was paid
to analysis of the first stage of B combustion preceding the oxide film
removal. A novel model, building a bridge between atmospheric and the
higher-pressure data, was developed by introducing B(s) + 0.75O2(g) →
0.5B2O3(liq) as the global reaction of B–O2. It should be mentioned that
in  the  PSU-model  and  in  its  subsequent  modifications,  the  global  re-
actions scheme includes the formation of B2O2 (g) as a product of (BO)n,
liq  vaporization.  Existence  of  this  gas  phase  species  has  never  been
detected  experimentally  and  this  was  underlined  in  [252]  where  the
simplified  B  combustion  concept  was  formulated  explaining  well  the
first stage of combustion of relatively large B particles (30~40 μm as
investigated by Macek [253]). An attractive feature of this last approach
is a limited number of unknown parameters, allowing calculation of the
burning time with acceptable accuracy of 20%. The estimates revealed
that transition from the first to the second stage of B combustion pro-
ceeds at the moment when 30% of the initial particle mass was burnt (for
30 - 40 μm particles). Furthermore, a modified PSU-model was devel-
oped in [254] to work with a more compact form to permit application
in a Lagrangian solver for use in fluid dynamics computations. The ef-
fects of forced convection were considered. The quasi-steady model that
was developed was shown to be a good approximation for combustion of
B particles less than 10 μm in diameter in ramjet combustion chambers.
The  results  of  the  modified  model  exhibit  more  reasonable  particle
temperatures in comparison to the original model and the regimes of
kinetic and diffusion limitation are better reproduced. In addition to the
above discussion, issues were raised in [255–259] leading to new op-
portunities for construction of advanced theoretical models of B particle
ignition and combustion.

With current models, the calculated ignition times are generally in
good  agreement  with  experiment  providing  a  valuable  tool  for  re-
searchers  and  engineers.  The  ignition  of  100  μm  size  crystalline  and
amorphous B was investigated in [89]. An experimental setup with a

The water in the above steps is formed from H2, produced by GAP
decomposition, and its reaction with O2  in the environment. It can be
deduced that the enhanced B particle ignition and combustion is due to
exothermic reaction of GAP decomposition products with B and its oxide
layer.

B-Mg  composite  is  particularly  attractive  since  it  ensures  fewer
amount  of  condensed-phase  combustion  products  with  respect  to
micron-Al powder [[181],[182],[246]]. In the reaction scheme of B2O3
+ 3CO → 2B + 3CO2 and B + 1/2Mg → 1/2MgB2, B2O3 is from the oxide
layer on B particles, CO is from the decomposition of GAP, Mg is from
composite. The addition of B-Mg to SP was reported as a possible solu-
tion  to  increase  the  burning  rate  and  reduce  the  agglomerates  size,
resulting in less than 1/3 of the mean agglomerate size when using B-Mg
with 25% Mg in the composite compared to B alone [[281],[247]]. For
propellants with B@Mg, the burning performance is a function of both B
purity and Mg layer thickness. The combustion of propellants containing
B@Mg (25% mass fraction of Mg) results in a significant decrease in the
average  agglomerate  size  [147].  It  was  found  that  the  burning  rate
weakly depends on B purity and Mg mass fraction, while more important
was  the  effect  of  Mg  layer  on  agglomeration  in  combustion  of  pro-
pellants with B-Mg composite and Al mixture. It should be noted that the
propellants containing both 20 wt.% and 25 wt.% of B-Mg composite (B
with  95%  purity)  with  Al  mixture  show  a  large  decrease  in  the
agglomerate dimensions with respect to their counterparts made with B
(90% purity) at 0.5 MPa.

In  another  example,  the  combustion  products  of  propellant  con-
taining B-Mg coated with polytrifluorochloroethylene (PCTFE, fluorine
content  of  52.6  wt.%)  and  perfluoropelargonic  acid  (PFPA,  fluorine
content  of  69.6  wt.%)  were  studied  by  Raman  spectroscopy,  powder
agglomeration  analysis,  electron  microscopy,  and  thermal  analysis.
Results indicated that surface modification of the initial powder by the
fluorine-containing  components  decreases  the  agglomeration  of  the

pulsed laser was applied to ignite B particles in a chamber filled with a
mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. The ignition temperature was estimated
via analysis of an energy balance for the oxide layer, considering the
heat  release  from  reaction  of  solid  B  with  O2  and  heat  losses  due  to
evaporation of liquid B2O3 and radiation and conduction into the gas. A
critical condition was obtained in the form of the pe value for the partial
pressure  of  gaseous  B2O3,  which  defines  the  stability  of  the  energy
equation solution. If outward conductive heat losses are dominant (for
small particles in a low temperature environment), then pe  is indepen-
dent of particle size and is proportional to the difference between the
particle  and  ambient  temperatures.  Similar  modeling  was  performed
later in [8] for analysis of the instantaneous injection of an ensemble of
particles into a preheated gas volume. A stability analysis of the system
of equations for describing the time history of particles and the adjusting
gas yielded a transcendental system for the gas ignition temperature and
particle  temperature  at  the  instant  of  ignition  where  the  controlling
variables were the particle radius and the particle concentration. It was
found that the temperature of ignition is practically independent of the
concentration of oxygen which was confirmed experimentally and cor-
responded to the conclusions of Macek [253]. Furthermore, the effect of
the  B2O3  layer  on  the  B  particle  surface  at  elevated  temperatures  for
single particle ignition was analyzed. Four processes, including liquid
oxide  layer  evaporation,  global  B  and  oxygen  reaction,  reaction  with
oxygen at the inner B core interface, and global reaction of B with water
vapor  were  considered  [104].  Because  the  B  particle  structure  de-
termines the specific surface area available for heterogeneous oxidation,
the burning time depends on the structure. From the comparison of B
particle  burning  time  based  on  heterogeneous  reaction  kinetics,  the
particle  surface  temperature  varied  over  the  range  of  3500–4500  K,
approaching the boiling point of B, whereas the combustion tempera-
tures of finer particles could be lower [260].

A model of ignition in air of B@Ti particles with a thin layer of Ti and
no  B2O3  is  presented  in  [28].  During  heating  in  an  oxygenated  envi-
ronment, Ti first reacts to form TiO2 and then B2O3 starts growing. The
Ti  also  reacts  with  B  forming  TiB2.  During  the  heating  process,  me-
chanical stresses that develop in the layers of TiO2 and TiB2 may lead to
their disruption facilitating oxygen access to B. In contrast to uncoated B
particles, B@Ti ignites at temperatures near 1400 K instead of 2000 K.
Thus, Ti oxidation accelerates the particle heat up promoting the igni-
tion process.

Detailed ignition model investigations with ABPs were conducted in
[[249],[251]]. The effects of temperature, pressure, oxygen concentra-
tion, and ABP size on B particle ignition were analyzed. It was found that
the higher the temperature, the faster the evaporation rate of the oxide
layer on the surface of the particles inside the agglomerate and hence,
the shorter the ignition delay time. With a pressure increase, the ignition
delay time and the minimum temperature of the heat source required for
ignition  of  ABPs  increased.  Additionally,  when  pressure  increases the
formation  rate  of  the  oxide  layer  on  the  surface  of  B  particles  in  the
agglomerate  increases,  while  the  evaporation  rate  decreases,  and  the
diffusion rate of oxygen to the agglomerate decreases. Under the com-
bined effect of these three factors, the ignition delay time of ABPs at high
pressure  becomes  elongated  and  higher  temperatures  are  needed  to
achieve ignition for the agglomerates. The ignition delay time of ABPs
decreases  with  increasing  oxygen  mole  fraction  in  the  environment
[[261],[262]].

To  raise  the  energetic  efficiency  of  B  powder  in  the  B-CEMs,  it  is
necessary  to  provide  a  high  temperature  environment  and  an  appro-
priate oxygen concentration, as well as to improve the combustibility of
B particles [263]. The most positive way to increase the adiabatic flame
temperature of B-CEMs is by increasing the mass fraction of magnesium
and oxidant [264]. For example, the combustion mechanism of fuel-rich
propellant  containing  B@AP  was  investigated  by  analyzing  the  com-
bustion wave temperature profile and flame structure, and the profile
was compared with that for a propellant with uncoated B powder, the
exothermic  peak  temperature  reduced  and  the  oxidation  of  B  was

improved [[265],[266]]. The volume fraction of ABPs had a strong in-
fluence  in  the  combustion  model.  By  assuming  that  ABPs  are  inert
substances in the primary combustion zone, the effect of the ABPs vol-
ume fraction can be adequately described by the model [267].

Studying  the  combustion  mechanism  of  B  is  complicated  by  diffi-
culties in isolating and detecting the various combustion stages, which
was demonstrated in [268] where the dependency of burning time on
the agglomerate size was determined with the use of a narrow-band (546
± 2 nm) interference filter with high accuracy. It was found that the time
of full-fledged combustion of a “clean” pure B agglomerated particle tb
depends  on its  size D  as  tb  ∼ D0.48  over  the  submicron  range of sizes
[269].

In summary, there exist numerous challenges in experimental and
theoretical investigations of B combustion. Work must be continued via
developing  experimental  methods  to  study  ignition  and  combustion
characteristics  of  individual  and  B-based  composites,  with  correct
determination of their size and burning time, as well as via constructing
correct  theoretical  descriptions  of  chemical  mechanisms  and  heat
transfer regimes for different size ranges of B particles [270]. Theoretical
studies on reacting B-CEMs at the atomistic and continuum scales are
limited and this is an area requiring further study.

4. Application in other applications

4.1. B-CEMs in pyrotechnics

B  powders  are  not  only  widely  used  in  SP,  but  also  have  great
prospects for application in pyrotechnics. The combustion behavior of
pyrotechnics  can  be  significantly  improved  with  addition  of  B.  For
example,  the  linear  and  mass  burning  rate  of  Mg/PTFE  pyrotechnics
with different mass fraction of B powder (PTFE 30% in mass, B-Mg 70%,
additional  2%  phenolic  resin  dissolved  by  ethanol)  were  determined
[[271],[272]]. Results indicated that the linear and mass burning rate
follow the same trends reaching a maximum when the mass fraction of B
is  15%. If the  B mass fraction is  35% or greater, the  linear and  mass
burning rates are lower than those without B. The average combustion
temperature of Mg/PTFE pyrotechnics increases with B content, until it
reaches the highest value at a mass fraction of 20%. For B wt.% greater
than 20%, B fluorination is less complete. The closer the experimental
values  of  heat  of  detonation  and  heat  of  combustion  to  theoretical
values, the higher the combustion efficiency of pyrotechnics. Interest-
ingly, it was found that the heat of explosion for pyrotechnics decreases
with increasing B content, but the heat of combustion increases with an
increase in B content. The experimental data on the pyrotechnics heat of
explosion and heat of combustion at low B content are generally close to
theoretical values, while at relatively high B powder fraction they are
slightly lower than theoretical ones. This fact can be attributed to the
theoretical  calculations  being  based  on  complete  combustion  of  B
powder, while in the experiments the conversion was not complete, and
the higher the B powder content, the more incomplete the B combustion.
At the same time, the effects of B mass fraction and particle size on
the  mechanical  sensitivities  of  Mg/PTFE  pyrotechnics  are  shown  in
Table 4. With an increase in the B powder mass fraction from 0 to 10%,
the  impact  and  friction  sensitivities  increase  slowly  and  reach  a
maximum value at 10%. The sensitivity of the pyrotechnics then drops
sharply when the B powder mass fraction increases from 10% to 20%. A
further increase in the mass fraction of B from 20% to 35% results in the
sensitivity decreasing slowly to 4%. Thus, the pyrotechnics safety per-
formance deteriorates with addition of a small amount of B powder but
when  the  mass  fraction  of  B  powder  exceeds  10%,  the  safety  perfor-
mance improves greatly with the increase in B powder content.

4.2. B-CEMs in explosives

Besides the B-CEMs in propellants and pyrotechnics, B-CEMs are also
added to explosives to promote their performance. The effects of three

kinds of B-Al composite with different B to Al ratio (PF-1, B/Al = 0/20;
PF-2, B/Al = 6/14; PF-3, B/Al = 10/10, in mass) on the energy output of
HTPB (16%)/HMX(64%)-based metallized explosives in air blast were

investigated [273]. The greater the B content, the higher the explosion
probability  (the  impact  and  friction  sensitivities  are  4%  and  10%  for
PF-1, 12% and 20% for PF-2, and 24% and 32% for PF-3, respectively).
At the same time, using testing procedures according to Ref. [190], the
impact sensitivity, friction sensitivity of polyurethane binder/AP/HMX
explosives  with  B-Al  composites  indicated  that  the  impact  sensitivity
became greater by 40%–80% and friction sensitivity by 100% than those
of  explosives  containing  B.  The  detonation  velocity  and  detonation
pressure of explosive with 20% of B-A1 composite in 1:1 mass ratio are
higher than those with other B/Al mass ratios (B/Al = 0/20 and B/Al =
6/14). The energy released by oxidation of Al powder can increase the
oxidation efficiency of B powder and further increase the total energy
release  from  the  detonation  reaction  of  explosives  containing  B-Al
composite. For example, the underwater energy of explosives containing
B-Al  composite were measured and  compared with that of explosives
containing only Al. The morphology and evolution of the fireball created
during the air blast process of explosives containing B-Al composite were
recorded, and the blast images of explosives containing the three types
of B-Al composites (PF-1, PF-2, and PF-3) at various times are shown in
Fig. 30. The detonation reaction occurs in a noticeably short time after
the sample is detonated, and a blast fireball is formed. Approximately
88.4  ms  after  initiation,  the  exothermic  combustion  reaction  of  PF-1
tends  to  be  finished,  and  the  flame  associated  with  pure  Al  powder
during the blasting fireball evolution almost disappeared, whereas ex-
plosives containing B-Al composite are still burning, and there are large
luminous regions associated with B powder during the blasting fireball
evolution.

The  high  temperatures  and  vapor  generated  by  combustion  of
hydrogen can promote the process of evaporation and disintegration of
B2O3  on  the  surface  of  B  particles,  thereby  improving  the  oxidation
velocity and permitting an increase in the mass loading of B particles in
the explosive. Also, the hydrogen element can improve the oxidation of
Al and B by the release of heat and formation of steam, and the increase
in overall energy output [[274],[275]]. The explosion energy and after

burning effects of nitric ester explosive with (Mg(BHx)y) were investi-
gated  by  underwater  explosion  tests  and  explosion  tests  in  air  [276].
Addition  of  (Mg(BHx)y) to  the  nitric  ester  explosive increased  the  ex-
plosion energy by 17.56%. Ammonia borane (AB, H3NBH3) has a very
high  hydrogen storage  capacity (19.6%)  and  the process  of hydrogen
evolution is accompanied by heat release, which has made it important
to the field of hydrogen storage materials in recent years [[277],[278]].
Two methods involving combustion of AB mixtures with nano-scale Al
powder with gelled water and external heating of aqueous AB solutions
to ≥ 393 K under argon pressure for releasing hydrogen from AB were
investigated.  The  isotopic  tests  have  shown  that  AB  participates  in
thermolysis  and  hydrolysis  processes,  thus  increasing  hydrogen  yield
[[279],[280]]. These characteristics are beneficial to their application in
explosives. However, the thermal stability of these compounds is low.
Furthermore, B@AP particles were used as additives to evaluate the heat
of  explosion  of  3,4  dinitrofurazanfuroxan  (DNTF)-based  explosives
[206].  Results  indicated  the  thermal  behavior  of  B@AP  is  affected
(obviously) by the particle size of B powder. The heat of explosion (7696
(cid:0) 1)  of  the  DNTF-based  explosives  with  B@AP  particles  is  6.5%
kJ⋅kg
(cid:0) 1),
higher than that of the explosive with uncoated particles (7208 kJ⋅kg
indicating the energy release can be effectively increased by the coating
technique.

Table  provides  a  summary  of  the  studies  available  for  B-CEMs,
including the purification, coating, agglomeration and other modifica-
tion of B, and their advantages and disadvantages with respect to the
performance of energetic compositions (supplementary materials, S1).

5. Conclusions and future work suggestions

5.1. Conclusions

Boron has been a promising candidate as a high-energy fuel additive
for several decades due its high energetic potential. In terms of volu-
metric heat of combustion, B is almost four times higher than any of the
present transportation fuels. . This review article presented a compre-
hensive discussion of the preparation, ignition, combustion, and appli-
cations  of  B-based  composite  energetic  materials  (B-CEMs)  in  the  SP,
explosives,  and  pyrotechnics.  Important  state-of-the-art  developments
and  challenges  in  each  of  these  aspects  were  discussed  including
increasing of particle size and improving the morphology during pro-
duction  of  B-CEMs,  ways  to  improve  the  ignition  and  combustion
characteristics when loaded into SP. Coating and particle agglomeration
have  created  renewed  interest  in  B  due  to  the  unique  and  favorable
properties  of  B-based  composites,  attributing  to  their  spherical
morphology and larger particle size compared with those of amorphous
B. The combustion of B can be accelerated by additives such as Al, Mg,
Ti, Fe, Ni, etc. Among additives, Mg is a relatively good fuel itself, it can
be combined with B with or without forming chemical bonds, and it was
shown  consistently  to  accelerate  B  combustion.  B/metal  oxides  com-
posites are capable of rapidly releasing substantial amounts of energy
through their redox reaction, which have a broad range of applications
ranging from solid rocket propellants and explosives to heat generators.
The binary oxide mixtures such as CuO + Bi2O3  are more effective at
promoting combustion performance of B than a single metal oxide (such
as  CuO,  Bi2O3,  Fe2O3,  MoO3,  and  Co3O4).  Based  on  the  tremendous
progress made in preparation and optimization of B-CEMs, addition of
agglomerated  B  particles  containing  element  such  as  fluorine  with
spherical particle shape and large particle size to fuel-rich propellant can
improve the burning rate and affect the propellant pressure exponent.

5.2. Challenges and future work suggestions of B-CEMs

An ideal energetic material with chemical energy in their chemical
bonds is a substance with high performance, safety and shelf life. Large
numbers of investigations have concentrated on the exploration or the
innovative  energetic  materials  with  excellent
development  of

properties, such as high reactivity, thermal stability, insensitivity, etc.
The reduction of the particle size of energetic materials from micron- to
nano- is one of the promising approaches for obtaining desirable prop-
erties [282–285]. The chemical reaction activity of nB powder is high,
which will greatly improve the performance of SP and explosives [286].
Nano-sized  B-based  composites  with  large  SSA  exhibit  high  reaction
rates  primarily  due  to  their  large  interfacial  area  for  reaction  and  a
developed reactive surface that facilitates rapid initiation of exothermic
reactions enabling a nearly adiabatic reaction temperature [287]. Even
though  the  recent  advances  in  nB  have  the  potential  to  generate
high-performance energetic fuels for propulsion, these nanoparticulates
present  serious  challenges  due  to  their  inherent  instability,  handling
safety and regular spherical shape. Tremendous progress has been made
in  the  preparation  and  optimization  of  B-CEMs,  while controlling  the
particle size, minimizing the cost, reducing environmental pollution and
producing  highly  spherical  shaped  particles  during  coating  and
agglomeration  remain  major  challenges.  One  possible  approach  is  to
create a stable suspension of B-based nano-sized composites in a liquid
fuel for longer periods of time with higher percentage particle loading.
To achieve a positive thermal contribution from B particle burning and
completely  stable  combustion,  extensive  investigation  to  fully  realize
the  viable  usage  of  nano-sized  B-loaded  energetic  composite  fuels  in
solid, liquid, hybrid propulsion, explosives, and pyrotechnics is needed
[288–292]. Developments of binary and ternary light metal alloy com-
posites  have  received  attention  due  to  recent  increased  demands  for
industrial  applications.  The  most  probable  candidates  for  lightweight
alloy  composites  are  Al  and/or  Mg  matrix  composites,  such  as  the
composites  composed  of  borides.  As  one  of  the  most  stiff-reinforcing
materials, reinforced Al-Mg alloy matrix are promising candidates for
practical applications [[293],[294]]. Transition metals such as Ti, va-
nadium (V), chromium (Cr), and Zr are readily precipitated by B as their
borides are more stable than those of Al [295–297]. However, the most
promising application of B-Al alloys is in grain refining with well eco-
nomic benefits [[130],[298]]. Moreover, B/metal oxide composites are
of great interest by worldwide researchers in recent years. The binary
oxide mixtures are more effective at promoting combustion performance
of  B  than  a  single  metal  oxide.  Though  these  metal  oxide  mixtures
substantially  improve  the  combustion  performance  of  metal  fuels,
challenges in obtaining homogeneous mixtures and interfacial contact
between  fuels  and  oxidizers  are  prevalent  [299].  The  fluoro-based
oxidizer  provides  an  advantage  of  higher  oxidation  potential,  the
novel modified micro-emulsion method was found to reduce B ignition
delay  time  and  improve  combustion  efficiency.  These  approaches  are
applicable in preparing diverse B-based energetic materials to improve
their  ignition  and  combustion  properties.  Furthermore,  the  ternary
boride, such as AlMgB14 due to its extreme hardness, low density, high
thermal stability, and desirable thermoelectric properties, is one of the
promising B-rich boride materials, which has been a subject of intense
investigation in recent years [[300],[301]]. The combination of B, Mg,
Ti,  Zr,  etc.  to  form  ternary  B-based  composite  are  of  great  interest
worldwide  for  their  synergistic  effects  to  improve  the  oxidation  and
energy release efficiency of B, including B-based hydrogen storage alloy
[302–304]. In addition, simulation methods for the theoretical predic-
tion such as binding energy, combustion features of B-based composites
