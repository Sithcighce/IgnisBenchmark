Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) based on calcium-looping (CaL) has great potential to mitigate the
intermittency and instability problems of solar energy harvesting, especially for high-temperature solar thermal
utilization. The CaCO3/CaO TCES system has been the focus of intense research over the past few decades for its
advantages of high energy storage density, natural abundance of raw materials, low cost, and environmentally
benign nature, simultaneously. Although some properties of the CaCO3/CaO TCES system have been concluded,
few of them consider the relationships between structures and performances at multiple time and length scales.
Herein, we summarize the multiscale developments of the CaCO3/CaO-based TCES systematically, including
atomic-scale mechanisms, reaction thermodynamics, cyclic stabilities, energy storage/release properties in re-
actors, operations, and efficiency optimizations at a system level. This review aims to broaden research interests
in multiscale structure-function relationships in the field of TCES and provide constructive references for
exploring advanced methods and mature technologies for material development, reactor upgradation, and sys-
tem optimization. Finally, it will promote the large-scale industrial applications of calcium-looping for ther-
mochemical energy storage.

1. Introduction

1.1. Overview of thermal energy storage technologies

Since the industrial revolution, the need for energy supply has
expanded due to the great development of industrialization. Nowadays,
the energy supply still mainly relies on traditional fossil fuels, such as
coal, oil, and natural gas. However, the overuse of fossil fuels results in
high CO2 emissions. As a result, global warming has become an
emerging huge threat to human society. At the 21st United Nations
Climate Change Conference, all the participating countries agreed that
measures would be taken to keep the upsurge in average global tem-
perature less than 2
C during the ongoing century, aiming to reduce the
effects and risks of global warming [1]. Under the background of carbon
reduction and carbon neutrality, it is critical to develop low-carbon and
renewable energy.

â¦

The utilization of solar energy is one of the most promising renew-
able energy technologies in the future. It primarily refers to solar
photovoltaic and solar photothermal applications. According to reports,
51 % of renewable energy has been used for heating and cooling [2],
demonstrating the importance of
solar photothermal utilization.
Furthermore, Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) has great potential in the
future due to its ability to provide dispatchable renewable power [3]. In
addition, the electric power, steel, and cement industries emit large
amounts of CO2. Due to the demand for high-grade heat sources in these
industries, it is urgent to develop high-temperature photothermal utili-
zation to replace traditional fossil fuels [4], which is necessary to ach-
ieve net zero carbon emissions.

The photothermal utilization of solar energy always faces the

problems of volatility, intermittentness, and uncertainty during energy
generation [5]. As a result, it is difficult to match the energy supply and
demand in actual applications. Using thermal energy storage in
high-temperature photo-thermal utilization can overcome the inherent
problem of solar intermittency [6], and then realize the continuous and
stable output of energy.

According to the different storage mechanisms, thermal energy
storage can be divided into three types: sensible thermal energy storage
(SES), latent thermal energy storage (LES), and thermochemical energy
storage (TCES) [7], as shown in Fig. 1 [8â10]. For SES, the energy
storage and release process occurs by the temperature change of the heat
storage medium [11], which includes water, oil, molten salts, cobble-
stones, concrete, and so on. It is the most mature way for thermal energy
storage in industrial applications due to its advantages of the simple
working principle and low cost. However, its energy storage density is
generally low, which needs large-scale thermal storage devices, further
increasing the cost of investments. For LES, it stores and releases thermal
energy through solid-liquid phase change [12]. The phase change ma-
terials mainly include organics, molten salts, alloys and composites, and
so on. The energy storage temperature and energy storage density of LES
depend on the phase change latent heat and phase change temperature
of materials, respectively. Some LES materials such as solar salts and
alloys have larger energy storage densities than those of SES [13].
Therefore, the volume of the energy storage tank can be reduced. In
addition, it also has the advantages of small temperature fluctuation,
high safety, and stable operation. TCES stores and releases thermal en-
ergy through reversible chemical reactions. It has the advantages of
wide temperature ranges, long-time storage, and small heat loss [14],
which is promising for the thermal utilization of solar energy.

1.2. Thermal energy storage materials and their characteristics

Thermal energy storage materials are important media for thermal
energy storage. Tables 1 and 2 list the temperature, energy storage
density, and cost of SES and LES materials. Although they cover a wide
temperature application range, the energy storage densities of SES and
(cid:0) 1. In contrast, TCES ma-
LES materials are usually less than 800 kJâkg
terials show very high energy storage densities from a few hundred to a
few thousand. Therefore, this review focuses on TCES systems due to
their high energy storage densities. According to the kinds of chemical
reactions, the solid materials for TCES mainly include metal hydrides,
metal hydroxides, metal carbonates, and metal oxides.

Metal hydrides are appropriate for hydrogen storage and heat stor-
age. At the energy storage stage, metal hydrides absorb heat and
decompose into corresponding metal elementals with H2 emitting. At
the energy release stage, the decomposed metal elemental reacts with H2
and releases heat. Common metal hydride heat storage materials include
LiH, CaH2, MgH2ãMg2FeH6, Mg2NiH4, and NaMgH3 [22]. The energy
storage densities of metal hydrides are generally high (greater than
(cid:0) 1). However, the operating temperature and pressure are
1000 kJâkg
extremely high, making the real implementation difficult. In addition,
the security of H2 in the process of separation and storage needs to be
prioritized.

Metal hydroxides are widely used in TCES. At the energy storage
stage, metal hydroxides absorb heat and decompose into corresponding
metal oxides with water vapor emitting. At the energy release stage, the

decomposed metal oxide reacts with water vapor and releases heat.
Main metal hydride heat storage materials include Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2,
Ba(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, and so on [23]. Among them, Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2
are particularly promising for industrial applications due to their char-
acteristics of low cost, high energy storage density, non-toxicity, and
high security. However, they also have problems of high viscosity, se-
vere agglomeration, and susceptibility to CO2 [24].

Metal carbonates for TCES are mainly CaCO3, MgCO3, and SrCO3.
Calcium carbonate attracts widespread attention due to its high energy
storage density, environmentally benign nature, large natural abun-
dance of raw materials (e.g., limestone), and fast kinetics of energy
storage and release [25]. At the energy release stage, CaCO3 decomposes
into CaO and CO2 when absorbing heat. The products are stored in the
corresponding tanks respectively. At the energy release stage, CaO reacts
with CO2 with heat releasing. This calcium-looping (CaL) method is also

used in CO2 capture in coal-fired power plants [26]. However, the main
drawback of the CaCO3/CaO TCES system is the rapid decay of energy
storage density with repeated calcination and carbonation cycles [14,
27,28].

Metal oxides store and release thermal energy based on redox re-
actions, including BaO2, Co3O4, Mn2O3, CuO, and Fe2O3. Some metal
oxides are also used for chemical looping combustion reactions in TCES
systems, such as CoO/Co, NiO/Ni, Mn3O4/MnO, and Fe3O4/FeO [29].

C) and high cyclic stability. Furthermore, it is
convenient and cheap to use air as the reaction medium and heat
transfer medium. However, the disadvantages of high cost, low energy
storage density, high implementation difficulty, and toxicity limit the
application of metal oxide TCES systems [30].

TCES materials. The intuitive comparisons among SES, LES, and TCES
materials are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, where some values are aver-
aged over the range of application temperatures, energy storage den-
sities, and material costs from Table 1 thru 3. First of all, the application

making it suitable for large-scale applications. As a result, numerous
mature water-based closed seasonal thermal energy storage systems
have been constructed and applied [31]. The energy storage tempera-
tures of most organic LES materials are less than 100
C. In contrast,
solar salt and hitec salt have larger energy storage temperatures. Alloys

Furthermore, TCES materials based on different reaction types show
different temperatures, energy storage densities, and material costs.
Except for some metal oxide materials, most TCES materials have larger
energy storage densities than SES and LES materials. Although metal
hydrides have high energy storage densities, their material costs are also
very high. Metal hydroxides have energy storage densities ranging from

factory workers.

Considering the above factors, the CaCO3/CaO TCES system has the
characteristics of high application temperature, high energy storage
density, large natural abundance of raw materials, low cost, and envi-
ronmentally benign nature simultaneously. Some industrial production
and electric power industries require high-grade heat supplied by the
burning of traditional fossil fuels, which leads to a lot of CO2 emissions.
The stored high-grade heat from concentrated solar power by using the
CaCO3/CaO TCES system is willing to replace the heat provided by
traditional fossil fuels. Therefore, the CaCO3/CaO TCES system is one of
the most promising systems in thermal energy storage.

In addition, other TCES systems based on alkaline-earth metal car-
bonates, such as SrCO3/SrO and BaCO3/BaO TCES systems, show similar
reaction characteristics to the CaCO3/CaO TCES system. They also have
the advantages of wide availability, low cost, high energy storage den-
sity, and no side reactions [38]. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, although their
advantages in energy storage density and cost are inferior to those of the
CaCO3/CaO TCES system slightly,
their advantages are obvious
compared to many other non-carbonate TCES systems. More impor-

Andr Ìe et al. [40] compared the energy storage performances of BaCO3,
CaCO3 and SrCO3 by experiments. They found that CaCO3 and SrCO3 are
promising for energy storage for the measured high energy storage
densities, despite not reaching the theoretical values. In contrast, BaCO3
showed a melting issue of the BaCO3/BaO mixture during calcination,
which was not suitable for achieving reversible reactions. Thus, the
SrCO3/SrO TCES system can be used as a substitute for the CaCO3/CaO
TCES system in higher temperature zones. Its research progress will also
be introduced briefly in Section 5, and many performance improvement
methods for the CaCO3/CaO TCES system can provide references for the

particular, several reviews focus on CaCO3-based TCES. Khosa et al. [14]

rials, CSP-CaL process, technology assessment, and economic notes,

reactor tests is still lacking. Rivero et al. [41] gave a detailed review of
different solidâgas reactors driven by CSP for CaCO3-based TCES, but
they only focused on the reactor designs and applications without de-
scriptions of other aspects. Raganati et al. [38] reviewed the
state-of-the-art carbonate-based TCES systems in CSP plants, where the
material preparations and reactor designs of CaCO3-based TCES were
introduced in detail. On the whole, although some reviews have re-
ported investigations on calcium-based thermochemical energy storage,
most of them introduce CaCO3-based TCES very briefly, and others only
focus on one or several aspects. This indicates that the current reviews
lack a comprehensive and introduction to calcium-based TCES. It is
critical to build a relationship of the CaCO3/CaO-based TCES between
the microscale and macroscale. Only by delving into the underlying
factors that affect the energy storage and release process, can we make
further improvements to the CaCO3/CaO TCES system and popularize it.
Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to provide a systematic and
comprehensive review of CaCO3/CaO-based TCES.

The main content of this review is the summary of important aspects
of CaCO3/CaO-based thermochemical energy storage, including atomic-
scale mechanisms, reaction thermodynamics, cyclic stabilities, energy
storage/release properties in reactors, operations, and optimizations at a
system level. Fig. 4 depicts several different scales of the CaCO3/CaO
TCES system, as well as some corresponding properties and parameters
[35,50â52]. We aim to conclude the current progress and provide
research and investigation directions of the CaCO3/CaO TCES system
further promoting the large-scale
from microscale to macroscale,

industrial applications of the CaCO3/CaO-based thermochemical energy
storage.

2. Principle and process of CaL for TCES

The working principle of the CaCO3/CaO TCES system is based on

the following reversible reaction:

The energy storage capacity of calcium-based materials can be
evaluated according to the effective conversion and the energy storage

In this case, the theoretical energy density of CaO is 3178.6 kJâkg
The principle of calcium looping is depicted in Fig. 5. In the energy
storage process, the heat from concentrated solar power receivers is used
to make CaCO3 decompose in the calcination reactor and store heat. The
decomposed CaO and CO2 are transferred to storage tanks respectively.
In the heat release process, CaO can react with CO2 in a carbonation
reactor and release heat, which can be applied to power generation and
industrial production. In addition, when the carbonation reaction occurs
at a high temperature and pressure, a high power generation efficiency
can be achieved [65].

addition, the mild calcination process is also carried out in the N2 at-
mosphere. However, after calcination, CO2 should be isolated from the
mixed gas for further carbonation [55,57,70,71]. As a result, a selective
membrane is required in the system, raising the cost of CO2 reclamation
and the operational costs of the TCES system. Furthermore, controlling
the CO2 separation rate and membrane stability is difficult. To overcome
these difficulties and reduce operating costs, the harsh calcination

However, the high CO2 concentration exacerbates the degree of CaO
sintering and causes pore plugging further. Therefore, the selection of
calcination condition should consider both energy storage performance
and operating cost on the whole.

3. Multiscale structure-performance relationships of CaL
materials and further modifications

Material design and performance improvement are of great signifi-
cance in thermochemical energy storage. The material properties, such
as cyclic stability, reaction kinetics, optical absorptivity, and thermal
conductivity, are the main concerns in the industrialization of calcium-
based TCES systems [33,73â76]. The ultimate microscopic units of
materials are atoms. The interactions between atoms at the microscopic
level define how a material behaves at the macroscopic scale, which is

7

the scale of interest for industrial thermochemical energy storage ap-
plications. Naturally, catalyzed by the advance in computing power, the
idea of developing material by multiscale modeling and simulation has
emerged with popularity over the last few decades, where the multiscale
in calculations generally refers to the electronic scale, atomic scale, and
mesoscale [77,78]. The macroscale performances of the CaCO3/CaO
TCES material, reactor, and system will be introduced in the later sec-
tions. The goal of this section is to introduce some of the key concepts on
the above fine scale, examine the state-of-the-art in multiscale calcula-
tions of calcium-based materials, and highlight recent developments as
well as some crucial and attractive topics for future TCES material
research.

3.1. Electronic scale

On the electronic scale (~10

(cid:0) 11 m) [79], electrons are the per-
formers, and their quantum-mechanical state dominates the interactions
between the atoms. Nowadays, in quantum chemistry, density func-
tional theory (DFT) has emerged as the mainstay of solving the
Schr Ìodinger equation [80], which simplified the many-body problem
into a three-dimensional problem by treating the ground-state energy as
a unique functional of the electronic density [81]. DFT can reproduce
the structural properties of crystals and determine the electronic density
with reasonable accuracy, which provides new insights into how ma-
terials behave. For calcium-looping and thermochemical energy storage,
the primary and most-used parameters in DFT calculations include the
total energy (change), electronic density, bond lengths, and dielectric
response, where the cohesive energy, adsorption energy, dissociation
energy, and activation energy barrier can be derived from the total en-
ergy (change). In addition, the optical parameters (such as refractive,
absorption, and extinction coefficients) can be derived from the
dielectric response. Numerous works have demonstrated strong corre-
lations between the above electronic-scale parameters and the macro-
scopic performances.

For cyclic stability, the doping models were built and doping effects
were evaluated in different ways. On the one hand, some researchers
built the interaction model of the dopant and CaO cluster directly, and
they evaluated the doping effect by calculating the adsorption energy
between the dopant and CaO cluster (Fig. 6(a)). In addition, they further
calculated the CO2 adsorption energy between the dopant-promoted
CaO cluster with CO2 (Fig. 6(b)). On the other hand, some researchers
built the dopant-promoted model by substituting the Ca atom with the
doping atom on the CaO surface [82,83], and they evaluated the doping
effect by calculating the adsorption energy between the doped CaO
surface and CaO cluster (Fig. 6(c)). They further calculated the CO2
adsorption energy between the doped CaO surface and CO2 molecules
(Fig. 6(d)). Although the doping models are various, researchers ob-
tained the values that fit their experimental data, which illustrate the
modification mechanisms and provide guidance for cyclic stability

studies.

Based on the experimentally observed phenomenon that Fe-doping
prevented CaO particles from sintering [62], Kong et al. [84] conduct-
ed a DFT study to elucidate the effect of Fe-doping in detail. The distance
between atoms and the segregation heat from structure changes in-
dicates that the doped Fe atom is oxidized by O2(cid:0)
to form an inert
structure, which provides
the
support
sufficient mechanical
calcium-based materials to avoid breakage and thus enhances the
resistance of sintering. Ma et al. [85] theoretically clarified the mecha-
nism of calcium aluminates in promoting the sintering resistance of CaO
by computing the structural evolutions, energies, bond populations, and
calcium
electronic distributions with/without

addition of

the

for

aluminates to CaO. The absolute values of adsorption energy of CaO on
CaxAlyOz (Ca3Al2O6, Ca12Al14O33, or Ca4Al6O13) are at least two times
larger than that on pure CaO, which is directly related to the better
thermodynamic stability of CaxAlyOz-supported CaO. However, the
charge distributions show that O atoms of CaO, as the active sites of CO2
adsorption, are relatively poor electron donors with the presence of
CaxAlyOz, which means the CaxAlyOz is potentially harmful to the
adsorption of CO2 on CaO. This negative effect is also observed in pre-
vious research [86]. Therefore, these calculations can provide a guide-
line for selecting modifiers and determining the suitable additive
amount. On the other hand, since the deactivation of CaCO3/CaO
reversible reaction is mainly caused by the carbonation process [25,42],

the promoting effect of Al/Mg/Zr [82] and eutectic alkali chloride salt
(ECS) [87] on the carbonation reaction is also demonstrated by DFT
calculations and confirmed by experiments. On the electronic scale, the
marked decrease in the energy of CO2 adsorption on the Zr-modified
CaO sorbents and the newly created diffusion pathway of O2(cid:0)
pro-
vided by ECS is favorable for deepening the carbonation process, which
profits the cyclic stability on the macroscopic scale. In brief, the
meticulous calculation of the sintering and carbonation process of
CaCO3/CaO based on DFT calculations has been supported by the
experimental phenomenon. It can be provided as evidence for future
efficient screening of stabilizers and further study of calcium-based
TCES composites with high cyclic stability.

For optical absorptivity improvement, doping metal elements into
calcium-based materials is a promising method verified by experimental
studies [59,63,90,91]. Recently DFT calculations brought more reliable
insight into the connection of electron structure with optical properties.
Electronic density of states (DOS) shows that the Fe atom doping into the
CaO (001) produced many impurity energy levels between the
valence-band maxima (VBM) and the conduction-band minima (CBM) of
the original CaO (001) structure, making the electrons jump between the
energy levels more easily, thus boosting the optical absorption ability
[84]. With the basis of electronic band structure, Da et al. [92] further
compared the absorption spectra measured by UVI tests with the com-
plex refractive index (the real part is the refractive index, and the

imaginary part is the extinction coefficient) computed by DFT, shown in
Fig. 7. The well-matched results indicate that the absorptivity of the full
solar spectrum is enhanced with the synergistic effect of refractive index
decreasing and extinction coefficient increasing. Guo et al. [93] com-
bined DFT calculations with XRD and UVI experimental results and
found that the change of electronic structure on the Fermi level caused
by Co/Mn ion doping is the key to optical absorption improvement, and
the results of DFT explained the wavelength-dependent mechanism of
the absorption property. In a word, the optical absorptivity of TCES
material reflects its response to the electromagnetic radiation from solar,
which can be reflected by electron distribution and dielectric response.
More electronic-scale research on optical properties can be found in
areas of photocatalysis[94â96], photovoltaics [97,98], and photo-
sensors [99,100], where vast knowledge on optical-absorption promo-
tion can be extracted and applied to calcium-based TCES materials.

For performance in reaction kinetics, parameters used in electronic-
scale studies generally involve activation energy barrier, adsorption
energy, and dissociation energy[101â105]. For CaO carbonation, Fan
et al. [106] employed advanced DFT calculations to simulate the effect
of steam on the carbonation reaction of CaO (Fig. 8(a)). With the
computational results of adsorption energy and reaction pathway, the
explicit promotion mechanism is revealed. The steam benefits the
carbonation rate by lowering the adsorption energy via the formation of
surface OH groups on the CaO surface. The adsorption processes of H2O
and CO2 by the CaO/Ca12Al14O33 sorbent were also studied by Ma et al.
[86] with DFT calculations and experiments. The CO2 adsorption is
accelerated by H2O activating the adjacent O atoms of CaO with more
electrons near the Fermi level. On the other hand, He et al. [107] further
reported the catalytic acceleration effect of steam on CaCO3 decarbon-
ation. The transition-state calculation (Fig. 8(b)) indicates that the
presence of H2O reduces the activation energy barrier of CaCO3
decomposition, thus lowering the reaction temperature and increasing
the reaction rate.

Unlike evaluating the modification effect by calculating the inter-
action between CaO and the dopants mentioned in Fig. 6(a), some
studies built the modification model by replacing the Ca atom with the
dopant atom in the field of reaction kinetics. Yan et al. studied the CO2
adsorption performance of Ce-promoted CaO in the presence of steam
[89], as shown in the left part of Fig. 6(d). By comparing the CO2
adsorption energies, they found that the surface O atoms in Ce-promoted
CaO are activated by the Ce atom, causing improved CO2 adsorption
performance. When the H2O molecule is pre-adsorbed on Ce-promoted
CaO and CaO, the adsorption of CO2 is also enhanced. Jang et al.
[108] studied the effects of promoters (Li, Na, K, and Rb) on the CO2

adsorption on the MgO-CaO(100) surface, as shown in the right part of
Fig. 6(d). Among the other promoted systems, Li-promoted MgO(cid:0) CaO
(100) showed the highest CO2 adsorption energy of (cid:0) 2.37 eV. Da and
Zhou [92] investigated the Mn-promoting effects in the decomposition
kinetics of the CaCO3/CaO energy storage pair (Fig. 9). The lower
transition state energy and dissociation energy make it more convenient
for CO2 to separate from the Mn-doped CaCO3, which is the mainspring
for the acceleration in kinetics.

Apart from the literature on calcium-based CO2 capture, in the field
of high-temperature thermochemical energy storage, Liu et al. [109]
systematically conducted multiscale modeling in the oxidation kinetics
of the metal-oxide-based TCES material (Fig. 10). They determined the
reaction kinetics rate constants by using the known energy barriers and
frequencies from DFT calculations. The results show that the reaction
kinetic rate constants can be utilized directly to estimate the CoO
oxidation kinetics, without fitting the experimental data. In short, most
electronic-scale studies on reaction kinetics are conducted by computing
the reaction pathways, and applications of this method to TCES mate-
rials have also emerged in recent years for its high accuracy in simu-
lating chemical reaction processes.

3.2. Atomic scale

Atoms, molecules, and clusters are the performers on the atomic

interatomic potentials (CIP) that capture the effects of bonding among
them mediated by electrons, which can be derived from DFT calcula-
tions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a valuable tool in
material research, yielding information about structure and dynamics
on the atomic scale. The basic idea for MD is to calculate the force on the
atoms and solve Newtonâs equations to identify how the atoms move
[110]. With the quantities of position, velocity, and acceleration ob-
tained readily from MD simulation and the additional support from
statistical mechanics, other quantities that depend explicitly on the
average of functions of the atomic locations or momenta can be derived.
These derived quantities, such as temperature, pressure, internal energy,
enthalpy, radius distribution function (RDF), velocity autocorrelation
function (VACF), and mean squared displacement (MSD), can reflect the
properties of materials in thermodynamics (e.g., heat capacity, free
energy) [111], structure (e.g., crystal structure, phase state) [112], and
transport (e.g., diffusivity, thermal conductivity) [113].

Alvares et al. [114] studied the thermodynamic properties of pure
CaO in high temperatures. The empirical Born-Mayer-Huggins potential
gives a good representation of pure CaO, and the results are consistent

salt (Na2SO4) on the CaO surface systematically and confirmed that the
rheological behavior of molten salt on the calcium-based surface
enhanced the ionization of CaO, thus improving the chemisorption of
CO2 and benefits cyclic stability (Fig. 12). The MD simulation and
experiment results found by Tian et al. [52] indicate that the lower
lattice energy caused the better thermal stability of dopants, which is
advantageous for the long-term cyclic stability of TCES systems
(Fig. 13). In addition to investigating the properties of metal oxides as
dopants, the properties of molten salts are also studied in MD simula-
tions. Therefore, MD simulations build a bridge between cyclic stability
and atomic-scale parameters, which provides an initial selection crite-
rion for modifiers of calcium-based TCES materials.

with the existing database and experimental values in the literature.
Furthermore, when considering chemical reactions, the reactive force
field (ReaxFF) is the most used one in describing atomic interactions.
Zhang et al. [115] found that the decline of CO2 absorption capacity was
attributed to the sintering of CaO-CaO particles by tracking the atomic
spatial variation under the ReaxFF. Wang et al. [116] employed the
same computational methods and thermogravimetry analysis to clarify
how temperature controls the formation of carbonate products (Fig. 11).
Tian et al. [51] described the sintering mechanism with quantitative
descriptors of mass center distance, atomic diffusivity, and lattice dis-
ordering in the chemical reaction process of CaO/CaCO3. The effects of
reaction temperature and CO2 concentration on the sintering extent
were efficiently accessed by ReaxFF-MD and agreed with experiments.
The above MD computations with reasonable prediction and expla-
nation of the thermodynamic properties and sintering phenomena of
pure CaO/CaCO3 support the further material modifications on atomic-
scale simulation. Early in 2012, MD studies already revealed the benefits
of MgO-doped in the sintering resistance of CaO particles [115]. With
the diffusion extent described by MSD and the degree of ionization re-
flected by RDF, a series of MD analyses were conducted by Chen et al.
[117â120]. They investigated the promotion of the molten alkali metal

To the best of our knowledge, there are few MD calculations on the
thermal conductivity of calcium-based TCES materials. However, as an
essential parameter for phase change material (PCM), a thermal
conductivity-related atomic-scale study in latent thermal energy storage
is relatively mature. The methods can be divided into three categories,
[112,121],
namely,
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) [122,123], and reverse
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (rNEMD) [124â126]. With the
heat current autocorrelation function (HCACF) based on EMD, Liâs
simulation results [121] combined with nanoscale energy transport
theory [127] showed that the surface roughness caused by the coordi-
nation complex of AlnFem (AlFe, AlFe3, and Al6Fe) induced the phonons
transporting in the scattering mode, which reduced the mean free path
of the phonon and deteriorated the thermal transport performance of the
original PCM. Pan et al. [128] compared the thermal conductivities of
composite phase change material (CPCM) calculated by the above three
methods, and the results were all consistent with the experiment. From
these reported studies, researchers in the field of TCES materials are
promising to obtain insightful enlightenment on the further develop-
ment of heat transfer performances.

The performers on the mesoscale (10

structural elements. Their

appropriate temperature should be selected to both improve the energy
storage performance and reduce
crushing risk, and the
calcium-based particle showed a high energy storage efficiency and
cycle stability when the radius fell into 300â500 Î¼m. In brief, mesoscale
modeling and simulation can not only serve as the bridge between
electronic/atomic scale and macroscale but also act as independent tools
to provide in-depth insight and guidance for improving cyclic stability,
reaction kinetics, optical absorptivity, and thermal conductivity of
CaO/CaCO3 TCES materials.

In this section, we have introduced the basic concept and traced
recent developments in the multiscale design of calcium-based mate-
rials. Table S1 summarizes the published works on the correlation be-
tween macroscopic performances and multiscale structures, where the
macroscopic performances for calcium-based materials contain cyclic
stability, reaction kinetics, optical absorption, and heat/mass transfer,
and the multiscale structures are represented by computational param-
eters, such as the electronic configuration, atomic distribution, and
energy-related quantities. Fig. 15 shows an overview of multiscale cal-
culations of calcium-based materials for macroscopic performances.
Contrary to the material design which is solely based on experiments,
the material design is pre-evaluated by simulations based on physical
theories
(such as quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, and
phenomenological theories). These theories provide a more compre-
hensive understanding of the underlying modification mechanisms that
can serve as principles for future research, avoiding blind screening
dilemmas, and expediting the design and development of TCES mate-
rials. However, most of the current simulations only focus on a single
scale, whereas the macroscopic performance of the real calcium-based
materials involves multiple scales. Therefore, one of the most crucial
and attractive topics is taking advantage of the multiple simulation
methods and building a unified description of calcium-based materials
or the related chemical reactions by connecting the models at different
scales. The challenges lie in the incompleteness of the MD force field, the
difficulty of information accurate transfer between scales, the high
expense of calculation, etc., which are also future directions and require
the cooperation of scientists in thermochemical energy storage,
computing, and materials. Besides, approaches that combine multiscale
simulations with machine learning are also hotspots today in material
design, which may also benefit the development of calcium-based TCES
materials. In summary, multiscale modeling and simulations allow for
the efficient and adventurous design of materials and their modifications
from the corresponding scales, which have attracted broad attention and
emerged as promising tools for further performance improvement of
calcium-based materials.

mesoscale science cannot be precisely specified until a problem context
is established [130].

The process for CaO/CaCO3 thermochemical energy storage and
release is a typical gas-solid reaction involving the electronic/atomic
scale, as well as the mesoscale that directly links the macroscale because
the reaction is a collective behavior of numerous atoms and molecules,
quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics is insufficient to predict the
whole gas-solid reaction process. When Liu et al. [109] conducted
multiscale modeling on the oxidation kinetics of CoO, they innovatively
bridged the mesoscale gap from the electronic/atomic reaction mecha-
nism to macroscale kinetics by developing a microkinetic rate equation
theory, which deals with the complex gas diffusion phenomena by
quantifying the diffusion inside and outside the solid particle, respec-
tively. Besides the role of a bridge, mesoscale modeling and simulation
are also great tools in materials design and modification. Xia et al. [131]
simulated the H2O diffusion within the CaO, which resembled the
mesoscale porous structure of CaO by the random-walk model, and
described the gas diffusion by the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM).
Their methods and results numerically evaluate the correlation between
the porosity of materials and the effective diffusion coefficients, which
are irradiative for the design of CaCO3/CaO TCES materials.

Recently, mesoscale simulation methods have been extended to
study CaO carbonation and CaCO3 calcination. Based on LBM, Liu et al.
systematically described the dynamic carbonation process of CaO [132]
by building a multi-field model coupled with fluid flow, chemical re-
actions, and heat/mass transfer. The mesoscale phenomena of carbon-
ation (Fig. 14) reveal that the existence of the porous structure greatly
improves the solid-gas contact area, provides more possibility for CO2 to
bind to the active sites of CaO, and accelerates the carbonation rate.
Further combining LBM with the Finite-Difference Time-Domain
(FDTD) method and Monte Carlo (MC) method, a mesoscale simulation
[133] on the calcination process reveals the intrinsic correlation be-
tween spectral absorption and heat/mass transport of a single CaCO3
particle, providing a theoretical basis for the co-design of photothermal
system. In addition to the above methods, the phase-field method (PFM),
as a thermodynamics-based mesoscopic approach, is also increasingly
being used in material science for its utility and flexibility in simulating
[79,134,135], which may potentially
microstructure evolutions
contribute to the advance of CaO/CaCO3 sintering-resistance. At the
micron to millimeter scale, Li et al. [136,137] developed a coupled
multiphysical reaction-transport (cMPRT) model based on the implicit
finite difference method, which was also applied to the CaCO3 particle to
study the energy storage performance and the risk of stress failure. The

4. Reaction equilibrium and kinetics of CaL

4.1. Reaction models and parameters for CaL

According to the principle of reversible gas-solid reactions, when the
decomposition reaction of CaCO3 occurs, the initial partial pressure of
CO2 is lower than its equilibrium partial pressure. On the contrary, when
the carbonation reaction between CaO and CO2 occurs, the initial partial
pressure of CO2 is higher than its equilibrium partial pressure. The
equilibrium partial pressure of CO2 is determined by temperature, and
the expression is shown as follows [138]:

As shown in Fig. 16 [3], the equilibrium temperature is 895

C at the
atmospheric pressure of CO2 (1 atm). Furthermore, the carbonation
reaction can be achieved at a higher temperature when increasing the
partial pressure of CO2, which enhances the power generation efficiency
of CSP plants [139]. Therefore, the investigations on thermodynamic
equilibriums are significant for the CaCO3 decomposition and CaO
carbonation.

Herein, we only concluded the f(X) used in CaCO3 calcination and CaO
carbonation, as listed in Table 5.

particle size on the reversibility of CaCO3/CaO and obtained the acti-

vation energy of 147 Â± 21 kJ â¢ mol
Nikulshina et al. [146] conducted a kinetic analysis of the carbonation of
CaO with dry and moist air containing 500 ppm CO2 in a fluidized bed
solar reactor. Kinetic models that account for consecutive chemically
and diffusion-controlled regimes were applied to describe the carbon-
ation rate with dry air, limited initially through interface reactions and
later through reactant penetration across the layer of CaCO3 until
reaching the unreacted core. MartÃ­nez et al. [147] measured the calci-
nation rates of carbonated materials derived from two limestones. They
found the calcination rate depends upon the calcination temperature
and CO2 partial pressure rather than the CaCO3 content or particle
lifetime. Biasin et al. [148] evaluated the CaCO3 crystalline phase during
the CaO-CO2 reaction. After combining the reaction rate data not
affected by external mass diffusion with the active specific surface areas,
(cid:0) 1 was

CaO particles. At the chemically controlled stage, the activation energy

CaO carbonation since the endothermic reaction at the calcination stage
requires higher energy to drive. Furthermore, the CO2 atmosphere

makes the CaCO3 decomposition more difficult to occur, increasing
activation energy. The addition of steam can decrease the activation
energy of CaCO3 decomposition. For CaO carbonation, because of the
diffusion of CO2 in the gas-solid reaction, the diffusion-controlled acti-
vation energy is higher than the chemically-controlled one. Although
the activation energy of CaO carbonation is usually small, it is not zero
since the external mass diffusion with the active surface areas also re-
quires energy.

4.2. Effects of atmosphere and dopants on reaction kinetics

â¦

To reduce the reaction barrier and improve the reaction rates,
especially for CaCO3 decomposition, many relevant investigations have
been conducted. Sarrion et al. [158] studied the characteristics of CaCO3
decomposition at low CO2 concentrations. When the partial pressure of
CO2 decreased to 0.01 bar, the temperature of complete decomposition
of CaCO3 declined obviously. The effective conversion reaches the
maximum at the decomposition temperature of 765
C. In addition, the
residual conversion of CaCO3 increased by 10 times than that in the air
atmosphere. Lower CO2 partial pressure reduced the grain size of CaO
and increased the specific surface area, thus improving the energy
storage performance. Troya et al. [76] investigated the effect of steam on
CaCO3 decomposition, as shown in Fig. 17(a). At the N2/H2O atmo-
sphere with 29 % steam, the effective decomposition temperature of
CaCO3 decreased to 680
C. The lower degree of sintering and higher
reactivity with CO2 improve the energy storage performance. Wang
et al. [159] studied the decomposition conditions of limestone particles
in a steam dilution (in CO2) atmosphere by using a fluidized bed reactor.
At an average residence time of 40 min of particles in the bed, the CaCO3
C of the bed temperature for
decomposition conversion was 99 % at 850
100 % steam dilution, whereas the conversion was 72 % without steam
dilution. With the increase of steam dilution for limestone decomposi-
tion, the pore size and pore amount on the outer surfaces of the
decomposition products increased, as shown in Fig. 17(b). In addition,
the steam atmosphere can also accelerate the CaO carbonation reaction,
by reducing the
influence of
high-temperature steam on CaO reactivity has been amply studied in
conditions compatible with CaL-CCS [160], as the combustion flue gases
contain steam in 5%â20 %, and many studies have demonstrated that
steam enhances the reactivity of CaO sorbents. Troya et al. [160] further

In addition to alkali metal salts, some inert oxides are also used as
dopants to facilitate the decomposition of CaCO3. Khosa et al. [70]
found that SiO2 could make CaCO3 decompose effectively at tempera-
C and ZnO also had similar modification effects [164].
tures below 700
Xu et al. [74] found that doping TiO2 also decreased the decomposition
temperature of CaCO3. Especially in the CO2 atmosphere, it decreased
from 903.6
C. Mathew et al. [141] conducted kinetic an-
alyses of the carbonation reaction of CaCO3 doped with Al2O3. They
found that the majority of the carbonation reaction was completed in
less than the 60s, which was much faster than the result of pure CaCO3.
Lu et al. [165] used Li2SO4 doped nano CaO to improve calcina-
tionâcarbonation durability. Doping 5 wt% of Li2SO4 also decreased the
complete decomposition temperature by 15
C. Table 7 summarizes the
effects of dopants on the reaction kinetics of CaCO3 decomposition and
CaO carbonation. Compared to the rapid reaction rates of CaO carbon-
ation, the CaCO3 decomposition is more difficult to occur because of the
high activation energy. Therefore, many efforts concentrate on reducing
reaction barriers and improving decomposition rates.

2(cid:0)
and CO3

In this section, we summarize the efforts to reduce the reaction
barrier and improve the reaction rates of the CaCO3/CaO system.
Decreasing the CO2 partial pressure and injecting steam at the calcina-
tion stage are often used to lower the barrier of the CaCO3 decomposi-
tion. Furthermore, doping alkali and alkaline-earth metal salts are also
common approaches. The molten salts are beneficial to the diffusion of
O2(cid:0)
, thus accelerating chemical reactions. The carbonation
kinetics are less focused on compared to the decarbonation kinetics
because of the rapid carbonation rate. The effects of steam on CaO
carbonation depend on carbonation conditions. In addition, although
doping molten salts may improve the CO2 uptake rate, the negative ef-
fect of pore blockage by molten salts should also be considered. There-
fore, in the future, the effects of molten salts easily or hard to decompose
and their mixing ways with calcium-based materials on thermodynamic
equilibrium and reaction kinetics should be studied systematically.
Furthermore, most studies about the reaction atmosphere are based on
experimental data. Thus, combined with the multiscale calculations
mentioned in Section 3, the effects of the reaction atmosphere can be
studied deeply.

5. Cyclic stability of CaL for TCES

5.1. Issues with natural calcium-based materials

The cyclic performance of calcium-based materials is crucial to
TCES, which determines the life of calcium-based materials in industrial
applications. However, the main drawback of natural calcium-based
materials (such as limestone) is the rapid decay of energy storage per-
formance after repeated calcination and carbonation cycles. Their

found that steam essentially has a neutral net effect at the more
aggressive conditions required in TCES, because the CO2 uptake is
promoted by the reduced CO2 partial pressure but also offset by the
substantial steam-promoted mineralization in the high-temperature
range. In addition to the effects on reaction kinetics, the steam addi-
tion also has influences on the cyclic stability of calcium-based mate-
rials, which will be introduced in Section 5.

Besides reaction conditions, alkali and alkaline-earth metal salts are
usually used as dopants to decrease the decomposition temperature of
CaCO3 and improve carbonation rates. Han et al. [162] found that
doping 5 mol% of Na2CO3, K2CO3, and Li2CO3 made the temperature
corresponding to the maximum decomposition rate of CaCO3 decrease
C, respectively. Molten salts can cause defects in
by 37
the lattice structure of CaCO3 at high temperatures, further generating
more decomposition sites [163]. Huang et al. [161] investigated the
modification effects of binary alkali metal salts on CaO carbonation, as
shown in Fig. 17(c). By loading the eutectic mixtures with a low melting
point and a good O2(cid:0)
transmission capacity, such as (Li-K)2CO3 or
(Li-K)2SO4, the CO2 uptake can be improved significantly. High con-
centrations of oxygen ions in the molten salts fascinate the generation of
2(cid:0)
, resulting in the rapid formation of CaCO3 and its easy regenera-
CO3
tion at high temperatures [161], as shown in Fig. 17(d). Choi et al. [87]
added eutectic alkali chloride salt (LiCl, NaCl, MgCl2, and KCl) to
CaO-based composites to enhance the carbonation reaction. The
carbonation patterns were changed based on the melting point of the
added eutectic alkali chloride salt. The addition of eutectic alkali chlo-
ride salt could provide an additional diffusion pathway for free CaO ion
pairs, which result has the potential to enhance the carbonation

of Chemistry.

microstructures show severe sintering surfaces and pores are blocked. It
is difficult for interior CaO to react with CO2, resulting in a decrease in
energy storage performances [67]. Guerrero et al. [27] compared energy
storage performances of natural calcium-based materials of limestone,
chalk, and marble at the mild calcination condition. After 20 cycles, the
effective conversions of limestone, chalk, and marble decreased by 27.5
%, 36.1 %, and 47.4 %, respectively. Sarrion et al. [67] studied the
energy storage performances of limestone and dolomite, their CaO
conversions after 20 cycles were 0.57 and 0.83, respectively. The inte-
rior MgO inhibited the sintering of CaO grains and pore blocking,
consequently slowing down the trend of reactivity decay. Sarrion et al.
[67] investigated the effect of the calcination condition on energy
storage performances, as shown in Fig. 18. The effective conversions of
these two materials obtained in mild calcination conditions were far
lower than those obtained in harsh calcination conditions, showing the
harmful effects of the harsh calcination. Therefore, it is inevitable for
natural calcium-based materials to exhibit conversion decay in calci-
nation/carbonation cycles, requiring further modification methods to
improve the cyclic stability.

5.2. Improving cyclic stability by non-doping techniques

In order to inhibit the conversion decay of calcium-based materials
after multiple cycles, many researchers proposed non-doping techniques
for their advantages of low cost and easy operation. Most of the non-
doping techniques are used for physical modifications, such as atmo-
sphere control, particle size regulation, and acoustic vibration. Valverde
et al. [166] studied the effects of thermal pretreatments under N2, He,
CO2, and steam atmospheres. Results showed that thermal pretreatment
determined the performance of the sample along the first cycle, but the
memory of this treatment was lost after a few cycles. They also inves-
tigated the role of particle size ranging from 2 Î¼m to 900 Î¼m on multiple
cycles [167]. Calcium-based materials with particle sizes below 15 Î¼m
showed high effective conversion and cyclic stability. For particle sizes
over 15 Î¼m, the multicycle performance was relatively similar regard-
less of the operation conditions. However, small particles have a strong
tendency to intrinsic agglomeration, and they are not suitable for
fluidized-bed reactors. Thus, Raganati et al. [168,169] proposed a
sound-assisted fluidization technique to overcome these limitations. As
shown in Fig. 19, the application of the sound with 150 dB - 120 Hz
resulted in a remarkable decrease in the deactivation rate in 20 cycles,
and its residual conversion was 8.4 times of the conversion under or-
dinary conditions.

In addition to steam pretreatment, other researchers also studied the
effects of steam injection at calcination/carbonation atmospheres and
steam aftertreatment on cyclic performances of calcium-based mate-
rials. Troya et al. [76] found that the calcium-based materials with 29 %
steam showed higher multicycle performances than those without steam

at the calcination stage. They also evaluated the effect of steam injection
during carbonation on multicyclic performances [160]. Steam essen-
tially had a neutral net effect on the carbonation conversion promoted
by the reduced CO2 partial pressure but also was offset by the substantial
steam-promoted mineralization in the high-temperature range, meaning
that the materials showed similar cyclic conversions under steam and
ordinary conditions at the carbonation stage. Hu et al. [170] used a
steam aftertreatment method to regenerate the sintered calcium-based
materials. The hydrated CaO at the degree of 150 % exhibited an
enhanced conversion from 0.3 to 0.6. However,
the reactivated
calcium-based materials showed a similar performance decay trend to
fresh limestone. On the whole,
these non-doping techniques can
improve the conversions of calcium-based materials to a certain extent
but cannot inhibit their decline trends.

5.3. Improving cyclic stability by adding dopants

To slow down the decay trend of energy storage density after mul-
tiple cycles, many researchers aim to improve the cyclic stability by
doping inert oxides, such as MgO [68,171], Al2O3 [69,172], ZrO2 [53,
173], CeO2 [57,58], SiO2 [56,70,174], ZnO [164,175], TiO2 [74,176],
MnO2 [63] and so on. Although many dopants are also widely reported
in the field of calcium-based CO2 capture [177], we only summarized
the dopants used for calcium-based TCES because of their differences in
reaction conditions and applications. Jim Ìenez et al. [68] prepared the
CaMg50Ac composite by sol-gel method with limestone/dolomite as
raw materials and acetic acid as an organic acid. After cycling on the
mild calcination condition for 30 cycles, the effective conversion of the
CaMg50Ac composite decreased from 0.78 to 0.68, exhibiting high cy-
clic stability. Wang et al. [171] used Ca(NO3)2â4H2O with Mg
(NO3)2â6H2O as precursors and citric acid as organic acid to prepare the
L8CA7D1 composite. The composite had high cyclic stability and its
effective conversion only decreased from 0.86 to 0.85 after 20 cycles.
Researches show that using organic acid to dissolve calcium-based
materials is beneficial to forming porous structures and doping MgO
can further maintain the stability of porous structures,
thereby
improving energy storage performances. Besides MgO, ZnO is also used
for material modification. Khosa et al. [164] mixed CaCO3 with ZnO
mechanically and conducted 100 calcination/carbonation cycles. The
effective conversion of this composite decreased from 0.82 to 0.36,
slightly higher than that of raw CaCO3. Its modification effect was
limited, mainly attributed to the preparation method and property of
ZnO.

Al2O3 is a common dopant for calcium-based materials among
trivalent oxides. Sakellariou et al. [172] used Ca(NO3)2â4H2O, Ca
(CH3COO)2âH2O, and Al(NO3)3 to prepare Ca/Al composites by the
Liquid Phase Self-propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (LPSHS)
method. When the mole ratio of Ca/Al was 81/19, the Ca/Al composite

generated. They have strong interactions with CaO and inhibit the
atomic diffusion of CaO, further improving the anti-sintering capacity
and cyclic stability [86].

SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2 are ordinary dopants for calcium-based mate-
rials among tetravalent oxides. Chen et al. [149] doped 5 wt% of SiO2
into CaCO3 by mechanically mixing. After 20 cycles on the mild calci-
nation condition, the CaO conversion decreased from 0.8 to 0.62.
Guerrero et al. [56] used rice husk as the bio-template to prepare the
CaO/SiO2 composite (containing 30 wt% of SiO2). After 50 cycles on the
mild calcination condition, its effective conversion decreased from 0.48
to 0.24. Khosa et al. [70] prepared the CaCO3/SiO2 composite (con-
taining 50 mol% of SiO2) by ball milling method. After 45 cycles on the
mild calcination condition, its effective conversion decreased from 0.34
to 0.19. Sarri Ìon et al. [181] doped 5 wt% of ZrO2 to limestone by me-
chanically mixing. After 20 cycles on the harsh calcination condition, its
effective conversion decreased from 0.60 to 0.37. Xu et al. [74] doped
TiO2 into CaCO3 by wet mixing method. After 30 cycles on the mild

calcium-based composite declined from 1257 kJâkg
According to the studies mentioned above, the modification effects of
these tetravalent oxides are generally limited because of the simple
preparation methods (mainly physical mixing). More efforts are needed
to exploit their modification potential.

(cid:0) 1 to 798 kJâkg

Since the modification effects of some single dopants are limited,
multiple dopants are used to improve the cyclic stability of calcium-
based materials synergistically. Choi et al. [182] used MgO with CaCl2
as dopants and acetic acid as organic acid to prepare the CMC20 com-
posite (doping 20 wt% of MgO and 20 wt% of CaCl2) by sol-gel method.
After 100 cycles on the mild calcination condition, the CaO conversion
decreased from 0.80 to 0.51. The fusion characteristic of CaCl2 results in
its coverage on the CaO surface, further decreasing the specific surface
area and porosity. On the other hand, doping CaCl2 can make CO2
diffuse from the CaCO3 product layer, further improving the CO2 uptake
capacity of calcium-based materials. In addition, doping MgO can also
decay the sintering process. Tian et al. [52] used TiO2 and MgCl2 as
dopants to improve the long-term cyclic stability of calcium-based ma-
terials. On the mild calcination condition, the average effective con-
version ratio was 0.54 in 100 cycles and the energy storage densities
(cid:0) 1 in most of the calcination/carbonation cy-
were close to 1000 kJâkg
cles. Furthermore, they used a modified sol-gel method to improve the
cyclic stability. Ca(NO3)2â4H2O was chosen as the Ca precursor, MgCl2
was chosen as the primary dopant, and tetrabutyl titanate or aluminum
nitrate was used as an auxiliary dopant [35]. The average energy storage
densities of Al/Mg or Ti/Mg co-doped composites exceeded 1132
(cid:0) 1 over 100 calcination/carbonation cycles and more than 75 % of
kJâkg
CaO still maintained reactivity after 100 cycles on the mild calcination
condition. Fig. 21 illustrates the energy storage performances of the
co-doped composites. The decomposition of MgCl2 into MgO led to the
formation of thin shell structures around the composites, which were
further stabilized by the generated calcium titanate or calcium alumi-
nate, as they worked synergistically to improve the long-term cyclic

showed the highest cyclic stability, only declining by 13 % after 20
cycles. Guerrero et al. [69] mixed the limestone with 5 wt% of nano
Al2O3 mechanically and conducted cyclic tests on the mild calcination
condition. After 20 cycles, the effective conversion of Al2O3 doped
composite decreased from 0.71 to 0.6, while the effective conversion of
limestone decreased from 0.7 to 0.16. It proves that doping Al2O3 can
improve the anti-sintering ability of calcium-based materials. Sarri Ìon
et al. [53] mixed the limestone with Al2O3 mechanically and prepared
the Ca3Al2O6/CaO composite. After 20 cycles on the mild calcination
condition, the effective conversion decreased from 0.72 to 0.41. Han
et al. [178] used calcium formate, aluminum acetylacetonate, and
aluminum nitrate as Ca/Al precursors, as well as citric acid as organic
acid, to prepare the CF-CA90 composite by space-confined chemical
vapor deposition method. The mole ratio of Ca/Al was 9:1. After 20
cycles on the mild calcination condition, the energy storage density only

cium-based composite was 1.5 GJât
doped 20 wt% of Al2O3 into CaCO3 by ball milling method, and the
Al-doped calcium-based composite was calcined at 900
C in N2 atmo-
sphere (PCO2 = 0.01 bar) and carbonated at 900
C in CO2 atmosphere
(PCO2 = 6 bar). The time for calcination and carbonation was rather
long, varying from 1 h to 96 h. The CO2 uptake capacity of this Al-doped
calcium-based composite is shown in Fig. 20. After 500 calcina-
tion/carbonation cycles, the CO2 uptake capacity was still higher than
0.8. Therefore, doping Al2O3 can improve the anti-sintering capacity of
calcium-based materials, since CaO reacts with Al2O3 at high tempera-
tures and calcium-aluminum multiple oxides (such as Ca12Al14O33) are

stabilities. As a whole, the modification effect of multiple dopants is
synergistic due to various factors, which is much better than that of
single dopants.

5.4. Synergetic improvement of cyclic stability and spectral absorption

In addition to the traditional indirect-absorption mode used in solar
collectors, the direct-absorption mode can significantly reduce the
thermal loss between solar radiation and TCES materials [62,183]. This
presents a promising strategy for optimizing the utilization efficiency of
solar energy. However, the poor solar absorptivity of the CaCO3/CaO
materials restricts their applications in direct absorption solar collectors.
Therefore, with the ongoing advancements in the study of cyclic sta-
bility, researchers are also delving deeper into the simultaneous
enhancement of both cyclic stability and solar absorptivity. According to
electromagnetic theory, optical absorption can be enhanced by
strengthening external electric field distribution or improving the
intrinsic absorption ability of materials [184]. The former can be real-
ized through the microtopography modification of the materials, while
the
achieved by decorating CaCO3/CaO with
high-absorption materials. It is reported that porous structures can
enhance optical absorption by exciting waveguide resonance and
binding light energy inside the structure [184]. Thus, porous structures
are beneficial for optical absorption, and they also serve as a guarantee
for the good cyclic stability discussed in earlier sections.

latter

â¦

Beyond micro-morphological considerations, a more important
method to enhance solar absorption is to improve the intrinsic absorp-
tion ability of calcium-based materials. In this regard, many doping
works have been conducted on calcium-based materials to seek the
simultaneous improvement of cyclic stability and optical absorption. Hu
et al. [91] decorated CaO with dark Ca2MnO4 derived from natural
manganocalcite, achieving 69 % light absorption in 300â900 nm
wavelength and simultaneously enhanced anti-sintering ability to 60
cycles over 700
C. Da et al. [92] fabricated Mn-doped CaCO3 by sol-gel
method. The optical absorption of CaCO3-7Mn reached 74 % because
Mn-doping changed the electron distribution in the calcite crystal
structure, and the energy storage density only decreased by 2.6 % after
20 cycles. Based on Mn-doping, Chai et al. [185] further developed Mn
and Al co-doped composites via the sol-gel method, yielding a composite
mainly comprising CaO, CaMnO3, and Ca3Al2O6 with an average optical
absorption of 86.14 % and a CaO conversion of 0.915 over 60 cycles.
Both Da et al. [186] and Zhu et al. [187] reported that doping CaO with
Mn and Cr can significantly enhance spectral absorption across the full
solar spectrum, and XRD analysis identified the formation of a CaxMn
(Cr)yOz solid solution. Li et al. [59] created SiC/Mn co-doped CaO pel-
lets through extrusion-spheronization, increasing solar absorption to 58
% via the formation of CaMnO3 and enhancing cyclic stability through

the inhibitory effect of SiC on sintering.

Besides Mn, Al, and Cr elements, other metal elements such as Fe
[62,75,90,133,151,188â193], Cu [63,184], Co [63,93,184,194â196]
and Ni [184,196,197] have also been verified in the improvement effect
of calcium-based materialsâ intrinsic absorption ability, where Mn/Fe
co-doped calcium-based materials are the most extensively studied. Da
et al. [62], Teng et al. [75], and Yang et al. [188,190] conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of calcium-based materials co-doped with Mn
and Fe in various proportions. The modified materials consistently
featured a porous structure with the phase containing a solid solution of
the metal oxides of Ca/Mn/Fe, which was crucial for improving solar
absorption and cyclic stability. Among them, the optimal mole ratio of
Ca:Mn:Fe was 100:6:12. The Ca100-Mn6-Fe12 composite achieved a
solar absorption rate of up to 90 % and showed a high energy storage
(cid:0) 1 after 60 cycles, as shown in Fig. 22. Meanwhile,
density of 1440 kJâkg
other researchers also added Al element in the Mn/Fe co-doped cal-
cium-based composites which further inhibited the growth of CaO grains
and improve cyclic stability [189,192,193]. In addition to the tradi-
tional homogeneous doping method, most recently, Wang et al. [198]
proposed a hierarchical-doping strategy for CaCO3 pellets using Al-CaO
core and Mn shells. The hierarchical structure enhanced active CaCO3
content while maintaining surface-absorbing substances, achieving a
solar absorption of 87.15 % and a energy storage density of 1143
kJâkg

(cid:0) 1 over 20 cycles.

Therefore, the research of calcium-based TCES materials for direct
absorption of solar energy has made more progress in recent years. By
optimizing the porous structure, doping different metal elements ho-
mogeneously, and introducing hierarchical doping strategies, the re-
searchers successfully enhanced the solar absorption and cyclic stability
of calcium-based material. In the future, researchers may explore
methods to decrease the mass fraction of dopants that do not directly
participate in the thermochemical reactions, thereby developing more
effective and economical calcium-based composites for solar thermo-
chemical energy storage applications.

5.5. Doping effects under different reaction conditions

The cyclic experiments mentioned above were conducted mainly on
mild calcination and atmospheric carbonation conditions. Since the
harsh calcination condition can reduce the operation cost and the high-
pressure carbonation condition can increase the power generation effi-
ciency, researchers also investigated the performance improvement of
calcium-based materials under these conditions. Sun et al. [58] used
calcium acetate, Al(NO3)3â9H2O and Ce(NO3)4â6H2O to prepare the
Ca-Al5-Ce5 composite (the mass ratio of CaO: Al2O3:CeO2 is 90:5:5) for
TCES by sol-gel method. The Ca-Al5-Ce5 composite was calcinated in N2
for 10 min and carbonated in 1.3 MPa of CO2 for 5 min in the tube

C. After 30 cycles, the effective conversion decreased
furnace at 850
from 0.86 to 0.79, indicating its high energy storage density and high
cyclic stability. Fig. 23(a) illustrates its energy storage performance and
microstructure. Furthermore, they used the absorbing paper as the
template to synthesize the micrometer-sized tubular composite called
Ca-Al2.5-Ce1-T, where the mass ratio of CaO:Al2O3:CeO2 was 100:2.5:1
[57]. Under the same calcination and carbonation conditions before, the
effective conversion decreased from 0.94 to 0.92 after 30 cycles, indi-
cating that the energy storage density and cyclic stability were improved
significantly. Fig. 23(b) illustrates its energy storage performance and
microstructure. The high partial CO2 pressure makes the reaction
equilibrium toward CaO carbonation, resulting in adequate carbonation
of CaO. Furthermore, the generated Ca12Al14O33 can improve the
anti-sintering capacity of calcium-based materials. The Ce3+
can cause
oxygen vacancies on the CaO surface and accelerate the reaction be-
tween CaO and CO2. In addition, the template makes calcium-based
composites form a porous structure with the high specific surface area
and specific pore volume. These multiple factors work together to
improve the energy storage density and cyclic stability of Al/Ce

calcination and high-pressure carbonation conditions. The effective
conversion decreased from 0.75 to 0.48 after 30 cycles. Therefore, the
energy storage performances of modified calcium-based composites still
show declining trends under the harsh calcination condition.

5.6. The improvement of cyclic stability for other carbonate-based TCES
systems

Similarly, the performance decay after multiple cycles caused by
sintering is also the main limitation factor for the application of other
carbonate-based TCES systems. The sintering of these systems is more
severe because the decomposition/carbonation reactions occur at higher
temperatures. Thus, the method of adding inert dopants is still appli-
cable. Ghorbaei et al. [199] investigated the carbonation kinetics of SrO
pellets and their cyclic performances. The carbonation activation energy

yttria-stabilized strontium zirconate (SrYSZ) as the dopant to resist the
sintering of SrO/SrCO3 materials and the doped material showed high
cyclic stability in 45 cycles. They also found that sintering began to
hamper the reactive stability as the SrO content surpasses at least 40 %

method and the doped material performed complete 4 cycles without
any significant performance loss. Bagherisereshki et al. [200] compared
the doping effect of CaSO4 and Sr3(PO4)2 on SrCO3/SrO materials.
CaSO4 and Sr3(PO4)2 were both found to hinder sintering, but Sr3(PO4)2
resulted in a greater gravimetric energy density relative to CaSO4 when
at the same weight percent. Ammendola et al. [201] synthesized a new
Al2O3-stabilized SrO composite by a wet-mixing method to improve
both the fluidization behavior and energy storage performances. The
SrO/Al2O3 composite with 34 wt% of Al2O3 showed the best perfor-
mances in 15 cycles, and its energy storage density after 15 cycles is over

temperatures higher than 1000

version because of thermodynamic limitations. Amghar et al. [203]
analyzed the potential of the SrCO3/SrO TCES system at an ultra-high
temperature. The calcination and carbonation temperatures were

In general, investigations on the SrCO3/SrO TCES system mainly
focus on the cyclic stability of and reaction kinetics. The reported values
of the carbonation activation energy are higher than those of CaO
carbonation listed in Table 6, indicating that the SrO carbonation may
be more difficult to occur. The reported dopants to improve the cyclic
stability of Sr-based materials, such as MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2, are
also used for the Ca-based materials. Although the modification effects
of these materials may change at high temperatures, the modification
mechanisms in these two carbonates are similar. Thus, the reported
modification methods for the calcium-based materials in Section 5 will
provide guidance for other carbonate-based materials in TCES, espe-
cially for the SrO/SrCO3 material.

preparation methods, and reaction conditions are also included. It is
worth mentioning that the evaluation standards of the conversion and
the energy storage density for calcium-based materials in the published
papers are different, as we described in Eq. (2) thru Eq. (5). For ease of
comparison, the effective conversion Xef,N (Eq. (2)) and the energy
storage density based on mCaCO3 (Eq. (3)) are used in Table S2. In
addition, the cyclic decay rate DN is defined to evaluate the decay degree
of energy storage density of materials after multiple cycles, which is
shown as follows:

DN = 1 (cid:0) Xef,N
Xef,1

(10)

where N refers to the cycle number. A smaller cyclic decay rate means a
higher cyclic stability.

â¦

According to Table S2, many researchers have conducted extensive
investigations on the improvement of cyclic stability. The reaction
conditions are different, and most studies conducted calcination under
mild conditions, mainly the He atmosphere at 725
C or the N2 atmo-
sphere at 850
C. Some experiments conducted harsh calcination at
950
C of CO2. At the calcination stage, the high temperature and CO2
concentration aggravate the sintering of calcium-based materials. As a
result, the energy storage performance decreases rapidly after multiple
cycles. At the carbonation stage, the high partial CO2 pressure makes the
reaction equilibrium toward CaO carbonation, and CO2 can also diffuse
fully, resulting in adequate carbonation of CaO. Fig. 24 compares the
maximum cycle number and the corresponding energy storage density

â¦

of the reported materials in Table S2 under the mild calcination condi-
tion. Calcium-based materials with energy storage density higher than
(cid:0) 1 are mostly co-doped. In addition, some Mg or Al single-
1000 kJâkg
doped materials also show high energy storage densities within 30 cy-
cles. Most materials were tested for twenty or thirty cycles. However, it
is necessary to conduct longer cyclic tests to examine the cyclic stability
of modified materials fully. The doping elements are mainly in the 2nd
to 4th period of the periodic table. According to our collected data in
Table S2, Al, Mg, Ti, and Mn elements are the most commonly used for
doping. Elements including Li, Na, K, Si, Cr, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Cr, Ce are
also used in some studies. When selecting doping elements, their
abundance and costs should be considered first. It is difficult to select
rare elements for doping on Earth. After that, their doping effects are
generally evaluated by cyclic tests. In addition, some atomic calculations
can also provide guidance for the selection of dopants, as we illustrated
in Section 3. The common methods for further preparing doped
calcium-based materials are compared in Fig. 25. The sol-gel and tem-
plate methods are beneficial for calcium-based materials to form porous
structures and achieve adequate mixing between Ca2+
and dopants
compared to mechanical mixing and wet mixing. As shown in Fig. 24,
many materials with high energy storage densities are prepared by sol-
gel or template methods. Therefore, the modified composites prepared
by sol-gel and template methods generally have high energy storage
performances. However, the preparation process of sol-gel and template
methods is complicated, and the cost is high. In addition, it is difficult to
use these methods to prepare doped materials in large quantities.

Therefore, the practical applications need to weigh the doping effect and
the cost of different preparation methods.

In this section, we discussed the effects of different dopants under
different conditions on cyclic stability. The dopant types, preparation
methods, and doping ratios have influences on energy storage perfor-
mances. Most doped calcium-based materials listed in Table S2 have
been cycled dozens of times, with a few cycled 100 times. However,
almost all modified calcium-based materials show declining trends of
energy storage densities in the late cycles. More importantly, according
to the sintering mechanism of CaO particles, atomic diffusion and sin-
tering of CaO particles are inevitable at the decarbonation/carbonation
stages [51]. As a result, it is difficult to apply modification methods to
permanently restrict the sintering of calcium-based materials. There-
fore, it is important to find cost-effective methods to deal with the sin-
tered materials and recover
their energy storage performances.
Furthermore, excessive emphasis has been placed on the synthesis of
calcium-based materials with high reactivity utilizing various synthesis
methods without regard for their potential for practical application.
Many preparation methods are too complex and expensive, which is not
very suitable for large-scale production. Only a small quantity of
modified calcium-based sorbents
since
high-performance sorbents require complex preparation processes. In
other words, they canât be produced in batches. To apply them to re-
actors, it is necessary to simplify the preparation process of particles
while maintaining their performances as far as possible. Therefore, the
scaled-up pathways of calcium-based materials for TCES are worthwhile
to study in the future. It is critical to investigate the microstructures of
high-performance sorbents and use low-cost methods to design similar
structures, subsequently achieving a balance between long-term per-
formances and the costs of calcium-based materials.

6. Thermal energy storage/release in TCES reactors

The TCES reactors play important roles in the whole system. The
modified calcium-based composites require corresponding reactors to
achieve energy storage and release. Furthermore, the design, measure-
ment, and optimization of reactors provide experimental data and a
basis for the operation and efficiency improvement of TCES systems.

Early reactors for CaCO3 decomposition are used in cement production,
which requires a large amount of heat input from solar energy. In
addition, many studies have concentrated on the CaL process related to
post-combustion CO2 capture. Some calciners and carbonators in the
calcium-based CO2 capture and cement production also provide refer-
ences for reactors in CaL-CSP plants. Although some reactors for other
TCES systems such as Ca(OH)2/CaO and Mg(OH)2/MgO have been used
and reported, we didnât summarize these reactors because of their dif-
ferences in temperature zones and reaction properties. Therefore, this
section only focuses on the calciners for CaCO3 decomposition and
carbonators for CaO carbonation.

6.1. Performances of rotary kiln and cyclone reactors

The investigations of calciners date back to 1980. The rotary kiln and
cyclone reactors were investigated mainly in the early studies. The ro-
tary kiln has the advantages of high heat and mass transfer, increased
particle mixing, and continuous operation. The solid particles are fed
onto a rotating receiver in the operation of rotary reactors. A centrifugal
force is created by the revolving receiver, which spreads the particles on
the walls [206] (Fig. 26(a)). The CaCO3 decomposition was performed
with small solar furnaces in a rotary kiln [207,208]. The decarbonation
conversion and thermal efficiency were 30 % and 7 %, respectively.
After that, Steinfeld et al. [209] designed a solar cyclone reactor for
gas-solid reactions (Fig. 26(b)). The CaCO3 decomposition was tested in
this solar furnace at 1300 K and the thermal efficiency was 18 %. Lmhof
et al. [210] used a 60 kW reactor prototype with a 90 m2 parabolic solar
concentrator to decompose limestone (Fig. 26(c)). The decarbonation
conversion was 85 % and 15 % of the solar input was converted into
chemical energy. Meier et al. [211] designed a 10 kW solar rotary kiln
reactor to conduct CaCO3 calcination (Fig. 26(d)). The chemical con-
version efficiency reached 20 % for solar flux inputs of about 1200
(cid:0) 1.
(cid:0) 2 and for quicklime production rates of about 1.3 kgâh
kWâm
Furthermore, they [212,213] optimized the operation condition and the
chemical efficiency reached 30%â35 % for solar flux intensities of about
(cid:0) 1. Nikulshina
(cid:0) 2 and quicklime production rates up to 4 kgâh
2000 kWâm
et al. [214] used a 5 kW solar chemical reactor comprised of a windowed
cavity receiver to combine the CaCO3-calcination and CH4-reforming

process (Fig. 26(e)). The CaCO3 conversion reached 83 % during 11 min
of irradiation at a solar concentration ratio of 1884 suns and a nominal
temperature of 1223 K and the solar-to-chemical energy conversion ef-
ficiency varied in the range of 7â10 %.

In the last 10 years, many complex and multifunctional rotary re-
actors have been designed and tested. Abanades et al. [215] designed a
1.5 kW solar-heated rotary tube reactor for CaCO3 calcination and
investigated the effects of operating parameters on its performance. The
photographs of the solar-heated reactor at the focus of a parabolic
concentrator are shown in Fig. 26(f). When the particle feeding rate was
2.7 gâmin
C, the decomposi-
tion conversion and thermochemical efficiency were 100 % and 16.6 %,
respectively. Moumin et al. [216] designed a high-temperature solar
rotary kiln (Fig. 26(g)) to perform the calcination of cement raw mate-
rial (80â84 wt% CaCO3). The calcination degrees ranged from 24 % to
(cid:0) 1,
99 % with input powers of 14 kW and material flows of 4â12 kgâh
resulting in a chemical efficiency of 8%â20 %. Plou et al. [217] used a

cyclone reactor to conduct CaO carbonation (Fig. 26(h)). CO2 is mixed
with the sorbent/air stream and then introduced into the reactor.
Exhaust gases are analyzed using a combustion gas online analyzer. The
reactor was operated at 650
C heated by a cylindrical furnace (15 kW)
and the CaO conversion was 57 %. Duarte et al. [218] proposed a solar
rotary kiln for CaCO3 calcination and a modified rotary kiln for CaO
carbonation to enable the implementation of a solar CaL cycle into a
cement plant (Fig. 26(i)). The solar calciner has to be operated at about
950
C to achieve feasible residence times of the treated solid material of
less than 12 min. A temperature gradient of around 50 K inside the
carbonator (carbonation temperature 600â650
C), can favor the
removal of almost all CO2 content in the flue gas.

6.2. Performances of fluidized bed and fixed bed reactors

The investigation on fluidized bed reactors for CaCO3 calcination
also started early. In fluidized bed reactors, the solidâgas contact is

improved, and the residence time of the particles is also increased,
resulting in higher conversion. Early in 1980, the CaCO3 decomposition
was also performed by small solar furnaces in fluidized beds [207,208]
(Fig. 27(a)). The decarbonation conversion was 0.8 and the thermal
efficiency was 15 %. In the last decade, more and more studies have
concentrated on fluidized bed reactors. Tregambi et al. [221] used a
directly irradiated fluidized bed reactor to investigate the CaL-CSP in-
tegrated process. The solar concentrated radiation was simulated by an
array of three short-arc Xe-lamps of 4 kW, as shown in Fig. 27(b) [222].
The maximum calcination and carbonation conversions were 100 % and
19.6 %, respectively. Furthermore, they used different techniques to
improve the performance of the CaL-CSP systems in this reactor,
including lowering of calcination temperature, pre-calcination, and use
of a dolomite sorbent instead of limestone [222]. After 20 cycles,
depending on the technique applied, the mean carbonation degree
ranges between 28.1 and 37.1 % (TCES) and 15.3â18.7 % (CCSU) with
limestone, and values 61.5 % (TCES) and 36.7 % (CCSU) with dolomite.
Recently, they also tested CaCO3 calcination and CaO carbonation per-
formances in an electrically heated fluidized bed reactor (Fig. 27(g))
[223]. The mean carbonation degree decreases indeed from about 62 %
(1st cycle) to about 14 % (20th cycle), which are slightly higher than
those obtained from the directly irradiated fluidized bed reactor (Fig. 27
(b)). According to their findings, it was the sand/lime mechanical
interaction rather than the chemical interaction of CaO with the silica
sand constituents at the process temperatures that caused the reduction
of total and reactive sorbent porosity. Thus, it is important to improve
the fluidization characteristics and optical performances of small par-
ticles of limestone.

Furthermore, the larger-scale fluidized bed reactor has been also
studied. Esence et al. [224] used a 55 kW pilot-scale solar reactor to
calcine limestone. The reactor was a four-stage horizontal fluidized bed,
irradiated on a front metallic wall of 1 m long and 0.4 m high, as shown
in Fig. 27(d). The best result was obtained for a calcite mass flow rate of

(cid:0) 1, resulting in a CaCO3 conversion of 95.2 % and thermo-
20 kgâh
chemical efficiency of 17 %. Chen et al. [225] designed a spiral coil
reactor based on the combination of pneumatic transmission and sec-
ondary flow for CaO/CaCO3 TCES (Fig. 27(f)). The CaO carbonation
conversion was around 60â68 %, which was a little higher than that in
the fluidized bed reactor under the same conditions. However, the
CaCO3 calcination conversion was only around 2â5% because of the
unstable gas velocity and the fluctuation of pressure drop. Ma et al.
[235] discussed the effects of CO2 concentration, reaction temperature,
fluidization velocity, particle size, and the number of cycles on the en-
ergy storage capacity and attrition behavior of limestone under fluid-
ization. With increasing CO2 concentration from 80 % to 100 %, the
energy storage capacity and attrition rate of limestone increased by 11 %
and 9 %, respectively.

Compared to fluidized bed reactors, fixed bed reactors have the ad-
vantages of low cost, easy construction, and operation, but they usually
show lower performances. Most reported solid-gas fixed reactors are
used for CH4 reforming and redox reactions. Few of them focus on
CaCO3 calcination and CaO carbonation in actual experiments. Peng
et al. [226] simulated a fixed-bed model for TCES under various oper-
ating conditions and analyzed the performances of three reaction types,
including CaCO3, Ca(OH)2, and Mn2O3. CaCO3 shows the fastest
decomposition rate and largest overall bed conversion (76 %), but the
materials in the upper layer are difficult to decompose due to temper-
ature differences. Xu et al. [74] analyzed the performance of the
CaCO3/CaO TCES system in a fixed-bed reactor, as shown in (Fig. 27(e)).
They found the reaction temperature and reaction time limited the
conversion rate of decarbonation. After doping 10 mol% of TiO2, the
decarbonation conversion reached 50.6 %.

The performances of different reactors for CaCO3 calcination and
CaO carbonation are listed in Table 8, and the characteristics of typical
TCES reactors for CaCO3/CaO are summarized in Fig. 28. Although the
fixed bed has the advantages of low cost and easy operation, the low

heat/mass transfer, discontinuous reaction, and particle agglomeration
result in low system efficiency, which limits its application. Compared to
the fixed bed, the rotary kiln and cyclone are more often used as the
CaCO3 calciners because of the high heat and mass transfer, continuous
operation, and uniform gas-solid mixing [41]. However, the mainte-
nance cost and energy penalty are increased because of the rotary
conveying materials. In addition, it is difficult for the cyclone to control
the residence time of materials, which causes an incomplete reaction.
The fluidized bed shows larger heat transfer coefficients and larger
thermal diffusivities owing to the motion of the fluidized solid. The
improved solid-gas contact and increased residence time of particles are
beneficial to the CaO carbonation. Although the fluidized system is
complicated, it is promising for the future large-scale application of
TCES. Thus, many fluidized bed reactors in Table 8 are used for CaCO3
calcination and CaO carbonation. In addition, some reactors with special
configurations are also tested for CaCO3/CaO TCES, but the perfor-
mances need to be further improved. In summary, although some

reactors are designed for CaCO3 calcination or CaO carbonation, some
operation conditions need to be adjusted for TCES. Furthermore, many
calciners and carbonators are independent and discontinuous, which are
difficult to integrate. Thus, future studies should integrate calciners and
carbonators to improve the efficiency.

7. Thermochemical energy storage systems using CaL

7.1. Basic concepts and principles of CaL-CSP integration

Up to the system level, CSP is one of the key technologies in the field
of solar thermal utilization because of its lower cost. The unique feature
of CSP is that it can be coupled with heat storage technology, so that can
easily regulate the peak and valley of energy demand and solve the
intermittent problem of renewable energy [42,229,230]. The CaL pro-
cess using limestone as the main raw material is a prospective technol-
ogy in the study of TCES systems. The earlier CaL process is applied as

often as desired in the field of CO2 capture. Relying on the release and
absorption of CO2 by calcium-based materials, the CaL process can
effectively capture CO2 from industrial waste gas (such as flue gas from
coal-fired power plants). The application of TCES based on CaL dates
back to the 1970s [152], when Barker proposed to use the reversible
reaction of CaCO3/CaO to store energy. In the 1980s, Flamant et al.
[207] used a 2 kW solar furnace to decompose CaCO3 and store heat.
With the increasing demand for renewable energy and the development
of thermal energy storage technology, the CaCO3/CaO TCES system is
considered to be a perspective system for integration with CSP plant
[178,231,232], so the research on CaL-CSP process integration is dis-
cussed in detail [3,62]. Over the past few decades, many researchers
have worked on the concepts, materials, and reactors of the CaCO3/CaO
TCES system. Fig. 29 shows the concept of the CaL-CSP system. The heat
provided by a CSP plant is fed into a high-temperature calciner to make
CaCO3 decompose. The decomposed products enter the storage system
after the sensible heat is recovered by heat exchange. CO2 generally goes
through the compression process before storage. Once the heat is needed
to be released, CO2 and CaO leave the storage tank and enter the car-
bonator. Finally, the carbonator releases the heat of the chemical reac-
tion to drive the power cycle integrated with the carbonation side.

The CaL-CSP process integration is related to the development of
renewable energy utilization in the future. The design of an efficient
system and the determination of optimal operating conditions are
conducive to the commercialization of integrated energy systems.
Typical CaL-CSP systems were based on the open Brayton cycle and the
closed Brayton cycle. The key difference between the open CO2 Brayton
cycle and the closed CO2 Brayton cycle is the way to handle the working
fluid (CO2). In an open cycle, the working fluid enters the compressor at
atmospheric pressure, and then it is compressed and heated. After
working in the turbine, it is released into the atmosphere. On the other
hand, in a closed cycle, the working fluid circulates in a closed loop,
where it is heated, compressed, expanded, and cooled within the system.
Fig. 30 exhibits the energy flow of this typical CaL-CSP process, In
the process of energy flow, the efficiency is a crucial parameter to
evaluate the performances of devices. Although the system efficiency
analysis and further improvement have been widely studied, those

efficiencies were defined in various ways. The definition and compari-
son of energy and efficiency are shown in the S. I. in detail. These
defined parameters are useful for understanding the following sections.

7.2. Efficiency and cost analysis

The open Brayton cycle and closed Brayton cycle are ordinary in CaL-
CSP systems. Edwards et al. [234] used the heat generated by CaO
carbonation for power generation based on the open Brayton cycle. They
found that the critical parameters for its operation were the activity of
the sorbent and the pressure and temperature of the carbonator. The
high activity (more than 40 %) of the sorbent hurts the plant efficiency
(similar to Î·ro(cid:0) tr in Eq. (8) of S.I.), and the appropriate adsorbent ac-
tivity can make the plant efficiency reach 40â46 %. In addition, the
circulating media also affect system efficiency. Tesio et al. [235]
compared the Brayton cycles operating with supercritical CO2 or Helium
based on calcium looping for concentrated solar power, as shown in
Fig. 31. Results show that choosing the He power block allows the sys-
tem to reach the highest performances, while the cheapest alternative is
the sCO2 cycle. This investigation provides suitable choices of the open
Brayton cycles for CaL-CSP applications.

The disadvantage of the open Brayton cycle is that the exhaust gas
results in the emission of free CO2. Thus, Chacartegui et al. [236]
switched to the closed Brayton cycle based on the system designed by
Edwards. As shown in Fig. 32, after CO2 is generated by the turbine, it
will be regenerated and compressed into a new cycle. When the carbo-
nator pressure is 3.2 bar and the carbonator temperature is 875
C, the
plant efficiency (similar to Î·ro(cid:0) tr in Eq. (8) of S.I.) reaches about 45 %.
Compared with the open cycle, the closed cycle integrated system has
obvious advantages in the control of gas emission management and so
on, which also provide the direction for further research on the closed
cycle integrated system.

â¦

Since the closed-cycle integrated system has more advantages than
the open-cycle integrated system, many studies have been conducted to
explore its system performance. Alovisio et al. [237] analyzed several
different configurations of the CaL-CSP system. Considering a CaO
conversion of 0.2, the plant efficiency (Î·tot in Eq. (7) of S.I.) of a closed

25

â¦

cycle is about 36 %, which can be increased to 40.3 % when the ratio of
the carbonator outlet pressure to the turbine outlet pressure is 3.2. By
pinch analysis optimization, a higher plant efficiency of 44â46 % is
predicted with a CaO conversion of 0.5 and much lower ratios of the
carbonator outlet pressure to the turbine outlet pressure. Ortiz et al.
[238] discussed integrated schemes for electricity production either
directly (using the closed CO2 Brayton cycle) or indirectly (using the
regenerative Rankine cycle or supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle). The
results show that the closed CO2 Brayton cycle can achieve a higher
plant efficiency (Î·tot in Eq. (7) of S.I.) of 44â45 % when the carbonator
temperature is about 950
C and the turbine outlet pressure is about 3.5
bar. Thus, the closed CO2 Brayton cycle is an excellent candidate for the
power cycle integration in CSP [239]. Furthermore, the closed CO2
Brayton cycle integrated system is still worthy of further exploration in
the technical and economic value of the plant. Ortiz et al. [240] also
developed four different configurations of the closed CO2 Brayton cycle
in CaL-CSP integrated systems, The total system efficiency (Î·tot in Eq. (7)
of S.I.) is 32â44 %, and the energy storage density is affected by CO2
pressure, CO2 temperature, and CaO conversion, ranging from 0.2 to 0.9
GJ/m3. Tesio et al. [241] conducted a complete economic analysis of
different power cycles including the Organic Rankine cycle, Steam
Rankine cycle, and supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle in integrated power
generation systems. The results of the economic analysis show that the
thermal cycle based on the supercritical CO2 Brayton (s-CO2) is the best
option for indirect integration in terms of economic benefits. To further
explore the thermodynamic effect of the integration of the s-CO2 cycle
and CSP plant, HEATSEP and other methods were used to optimize the
s-CO2 cycle integrated system. The CaO conversion is the key parameter
to affect the system layout and efficiency, and the optimized CaL effi-
ciency (Î·CaL in Eq. (6) of S.I.) of the indirect integrated system was 40.4
%.

Remarkably, a large number of TCES systems have been applied to

CSP plants [33]. Furthermore, some studies have focused on the TCES
application of solar photovoltaic (PV) plants to improve dispatchability.
Fern Ìandez et al. [242] designed a PV-CSP system that uses electrical
energy from PV plants for endothermic reactions. They found that the
overall efficiency can be improved by optimizing energy recovery in the
process and selecting optimum reactor conditions (pressure, tempera-
ture, composition, etc.). The overall efficiency (Î·CaL(cid:0) PV in Eq. (14) of S.
I.) can achieve of about 40 % with lower investment costs when
compared with batteries. Furthermore, Petrollese et al. [243] obtained
the optimal design parameters of the PV-CSP hybrid system to minimize
levelized cost of energy (LCOE), which is mainly affected by five design
parameters of solar field area, TES capacity, and ORC nominal power for
the CSP section, PV array power and battery capacity for the PV section.
Bravo et al. [244,245] conducted a multi-objective optimization of the
PV-CSP hybrid plant to determine the best one-year hourly operational
strategy, the operation diagram is shown in Fig. 33. The results provide
guidance for the economic analysis of the hybrid plant. Starke et al.
[246] also confirmed that the introduction of a PV plant can further
reduce the cost of power generation. These investigations contribute to
the proper assessment of the CSP-PV hybrid system through a practical
and comprehensive approach, which provides decision-making mecha-
nisms to aid a proper design of the system.

7.3. Performance improvements of various CaL-CSP systems

The above studies show that the system efficiency is affected by
including CaO conversion, carbonation temperature,
many factors,
carbonation pressure, circulating media, cycle types, and integration
degree. Thus, many efforts have been made to improve the system ef-
ficiency. Ortiz et al. [247] studied the performance of the integrated
system under pure CO2 and low-pressure (0.01 bar) calcination condi-
tions. The low-pressure calcination method reduces the calcination

7.4. System coupling of CaL and other thermochemical technologies

(cid:0) 3 to 483.6 kWhâm

The previous sections mainly focus on different CaL-CSP systems,
especially in the aspects of efficiency improvement. In addition to the
CaL-CSP technology, the calcium-looping can be also coupled with other
technologies, which also provide guidance for the application of the
CaL-CSP technology. Hanak et al. [257] presented a concept of the CaL
the
process with inherent energy storage for decarbonization of
coal-fired power plant, including CaO/CaCO3 solids storage, CaO/Ca
(OH)2 solids storage, and cryogenic O2 storage systems. Natural gas is
burned in a calciner by providing O2, which results in a higher turndown
of the entire system and offers higher energy density. Furthermore, the
reactivation step by the Ca(OH)2/CaO loop improved the energy storage
density of the CaO/CaCO3 energy storage system by 57.4 %, from 307.2
(cid:0) 3. Some researchers proposed and developed
kWhâm
a Ca/Cu chemical loop for CO2 capture[258â260]. The exothermic
reduction of CuO with CH4 was used to obtain the heat necessary for the
decomposition of the CaCO3 formed in the reforming step, and the flue
gas was used for CaO carbonation and Cu oxidation. The Ca/Cu chem-
ical loop improved the system integration and reduced the need for
post-processing equipment. Wu et al. [261] combined a steam methane
reformer (SMR) with the CaL process to produce syngas, where CaL
worked to purify the product (H2) and capture CO2. Teng et al. [197]
also reported a modified CaL that directly utilized solar energy to cap-
ture and convert CO2 into syngas along with CH4, as shown in Fig. 35.
CH4 was used as the calcination atmosphere for the decomposition of
CaCO3 so that the released high-temperature CO2 could react in situ with
CH4 without a need for additional transport and storage processes. They
conducted experiments in a fixed-bed reactor and added Ni into CaCO3
to enhance the direct solar absorption and catalyze the in-situ CO2
conversion reaction. The in-situ conversion ratio of CO2 reached up to
85.6 %, which in reverse facilitated the decomposition of CaCO3. Cao
et al. [262] proposed a novel system for the comprehensive utilization
process of treated flue gas (CO2/NOx/O2) from CaL. The dried municipal
sludge was added into the pyrolysis reactor to generate pyrolysis gases
and biochar. The pyrolysis gases containing HCN and NH3 can react with
the NOx in the treated flue gas from CaL under the reducing atmosphere.
The role of CaL in this process was to absorb CO2 and provide heat
source for the pyrolysis reactor.

On the whole, the CaCO3/CaO reversible reaction can be coupled
with other calcium-based systems or redox systems, and their main
manifestations are process coupling and synergistic reaction. The pro-
cess coupling means that calcium-based materials experience different
processes in a cycle. For example, the calcined CaO reacts with steam
and then enters the carbonator for CO2 capture, as shown in Ref. [257].
The synergistic reaction means that the CaCO3/CaO reversible reaction
occurs with other reactions simultaneously in the same reactor, as
shown in Fig. 35. The temperature range of the synergistic reaction of
the two reactions should be close, and the products of one system are
generally reactants of the other system. The system coupling between
CaL with other thermochemical technologies can improve the integra-
tion and expand the function of the system, which is promising in in-
dustrial applications. Future research will focus on improving the
efficiency of existing coupling systems and developing new coupling
systems based on the chemical reaction properties of the CaCO3/CaO
solids and CO2 gas.

7.5. Summary and prospect of the CaL-CSP process integration

The integration of the CaL-CSP process is always a hot topic in the
development of heat storage technology for calcium-based materials.
Table S3 summarizes the current integrated schemes research of CaL-
CSP from two aspects of system design and operating conditions. In
terms of system design, the open system and closed system respectively
provide references for subsequent researchers. However, due to the open
system cannot avoid the free CO2 emissions, the closed system is

temperature and increases the receiver efficiency (similar to Î·receiver in
Eq. (1) of S.I.) by more than 10 %. In addition, reducing the calcination
temperature will allow metal receivers already tested on an MW scale to
be integrated into the CaL-CSP integrated system, which provides more
options. Tomkute and Hu et al. [248,249] found that the CaO melting
and dissolving into CaCl2 can improve the activity of the materials. Wu
et al. [250] extended Tomkuteâs method to the application and devel-
oped a phase change calcium looping energy storage system. As shown
in Fig. 34, the potential system performances were evaluated in terms of
efficiency and energy storage density. The results show that the
round-trip efficiency (Î·ro(cid:0) tr in Eq. (8) of S.I.) of the system is about 49
%, which is 4 % higher than that of the traditional CaL-TES system. It1s
(cid:0) 3 than
energy storage density is close to 1.5 GJâm
that of the traditional system. The round-trip efficiency of the system can
be improved by optimizing the CaCl2 molar fraction, carbonation tem-
perature, and carbonation pressure. Karasavvas et al. [251] developed
an integrated CSP plant for 24 h continuous power generation, and a
portion of the high-temperature sensible heat generated by calcination is
used for Rankine cycle power generation. A global energy efficiency (Î·en
in Eq. (12) of S.I.) of 31.5 % can be obtained at a carbonation pressure
of 7 bar and a CaO inlet temperature of 690
C, while only 28.6 % can be
obtained at atmospheric pressure and the same temperature. They also
performed energy and exergy analysis on the CaL-CSP system and found
that higher CaO storage temperature can reduce exergy loss and improve
energy utilization benefits [252].

(cid:0) 3, exceeding 0.2 GJâm

In addition to optimizing reaction conditions and integrating other
systems, the components of the reaction system can also be further
optimized. Ortiz et al. [253] used a pressurized gas chamber as a solar
receiver, and the power plant efficiency (similar to Î·CaL in Eq. (6) of S.I.)
could reach 44.5 % without considering the heat loss on the solar side.
C, and steel slag
Their system heat storage temperature reached 1000
was added to the system to absorb the high sensible heat of the gas.
Bailera et al. [254] considered the influence of the scale of the carbon-
ation reactor and established a more detailed model to provide a
reference for the design of large-scale carbonation side equipment. Chen
et al. [255] adopted sensible heat recovery to improve energy storage
efficiency. When the sensible heat is fully utilized in the charging pro-
cess, discharging process, and the whole system, the energy storage ef-
ficiency (Î·ch in Eq. (3) of S.I.) increases by 45.1 %, 32.1 %, and 61.59 %.
Xu et al. [256] designed a CO2 Brayton cycle and Rankine cycle com-
bined CaL-CSP integrated system. The significance of sensible heat re-
covery is deeply reflected in the study, the sensible heat from both the
calcination outlet and the gas after working through the Brayton cycle
are used to drive the Rankine cycle. Sensitivity analysis shows that
850
C is an ideal choice for carbonation temperature, which can make
the global efficiency (similar to Î·GE in Eq. (11) of S.I.) reach 44.5 %, and
higher CaO conversion and pressure ratio will further improve the global
efficiency.

considered a better solution for the CaL-CSP system. To convert and feed
the absorbed solar energy into a power cycle, the integration methods
can be divided into direct and indirect methods. The direct method
means that CO2 discharged from the carbonator directly enters the
turbine for power generation, and the indirect method is applied by
adding a power module (mostly a heat exchange device) to absorb and
convert the high-temperature sensible heat of the products discharged
from the carbonator. It can be seen that the direct integration method
has been studied more widely. Since the CaL-CSP system contains
multiple cold and hot streams, the design of the heat exchanger network
will significantly affect the global efficiency of the integrated system.
Basically, each system scheme will configure heat exchangers on the
calcination side and the carbonation side, but the position and the type
of heat exchanger are different. When ignoring the power cycle re-
generators, the gas-solid heat exchanger is used as the usual heat
transfer device, and the solid-solid heat exchanger is also considered for
further heat transfer optimization. In addition, the heat recovery steam
generator (HRSG) is adopted in the study of the integrated Rankine cycle
on the calcination side. The configuration of the heat exchanger on the
calcination side is relatively simple, mainly based on the heat exchange
between the two products of the calciner and the single solid cold stream
entering the calciner. The configuration on the carbonation side is more
variable because it releases energy and integrates with the power cycle.
Taking the closed CO2 Brayton cycle as an example, the main heat
transfer streams include the CaO and CO2 streams from storage tanks,
the hot solid stream from the carbonator, and the hot gas stream from
the turbine outlet. The number of heat exchangers and heat exchange
conditions of multiple streams can also derive the related research on
heat exchange network optimization. Quite interestingly, many re-
searchers have adopted the pinch analysis method to optimize the heat
exchanger network of integrated systems.

Compared with the Rankine cycle, supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle,
and other power cycles, the closed CO2 Brayton cycle has attracted more

attention in terms of technical and economic value for its high global
plant efficiency. The CaO conversion, the pressure ratio of turbine inlet
to outlet, and carbonation conditions are considered to be the dominant
parameters of the energy storage performance of the closed CO2 Brayton
cycle integrated system. Therefore, in terms of operating conditions, five
items are summarized from the calcination side to provide solar heat,
CaO conversion, the pressure ratio of turbine inlet to outlet, reactor
conditions, and storage tank conditions. Most researchers assume that
the value of solar thermal power to the calciner is 100 MW, and the
daytime is determined by different solar multiple (SM) values (generally
about 2â3 in CSP plants). The sensitivity analysis of CaO conversion, the
pressure ratio of turbine inlet to outlet, and carbonator temperature
show that higher CaO conversion can reduce the auxiliary power con-
sumption of solid transport and improve global efficiency. In addition,
the high carbonator pressure can increase the carbonation temperature
on the basis of the thermodynamic reaction equilibrium principle, so as
to achieve higher global efficiency. The adoption of a higher pressure-
ratio of turbine inlet to outlet also shows an increase in plant effi-
ciency. But the value of the pressure ratio is generally considered to be
about 3â3.5, further increase will inhibit the efficiency.

Therefore, the studies on system integration schemes are more and
more abundant, and some new integrated systems such as the CaL-PV-
CSP hybrid system have also been proposed. In addition, the system
coupling between CaL with other thermochemical technologies can
improve the integration and expand the function of the system, which is
promising in industrial applications. However, the existing systematic
research is scarce in pilot and large-scale experimental research, which
seriously hinders the industrialization of renewable energy utilization
and thermochemical heat storage technology. It is urgent to improve the
performance of calcium-based materials and develop more efficient
solar receivers. In the meantime, improving the technical and economic
values requires more attention to the design of the heat exchange
network and the multi-objective optimization of the system.

8. Challenges and future prospects

9. Conclusion

Many investigations listed and summarized in this review have
overcome some of the primary limitations of calcium-based TCES.
However, this promising research field is still confronted with chal-
lenges at the micro-nano scale mechanism, material performance,
reactor, system, and multi-scale coupling, which should be further
studied.

At first, at the micro-nano scale, many calculations and simulations
have been conducted to reveal the material property and reaction
mechanism, which serves as principles for material design and modifi-
cation. However, most of the current simulations only focus on a single
scale and calculate limited properties, which makes it hard to match the
actual material properties. Thus, future crucial and attractive topics are
taking advantage of the multiple simulation methods and building a
unified description of calcium-based materials or the related chemical
reactions by connecting the models at different scales. Besides, the
multiscale simulations combined with machine learning are promising
in material design. Secondly, at the material scale, reaction thermody-
namics and cyclic stability are the two aspects that get the most atten-
tion. Many efforts aim to reduce the reaction barrier and improve the
reaction rates of the CaCO3/CaO reversible reaction, including adjusting
the CO2 partial pressure, injecting steam, and doping molten salts. In the
future, the decomposition property of molten salts and their mixing
ways with calcium-based materials should be studied systematically. In
addition, future studies should also use multiscale calculations to direct
the setting of reaction conditions and the selection of molten salts. Cyclic
stability is the primary issue of calcium-based TCES. Many researchers
have studied the effects of different dopants under different conditions
on cyclic stability. In addition, some studies also focus on the synergy
improvement of cyclic stability and spectral absorption. However,
almost all modified calcium-based materials show declining trends of
energy storage densities in the late cycles. It is urgent to find cost-
effective methods to deal with the sintered materials and recover their
energy storage performances. In addition, the scaled-up pathways of
high-performance calcium-based TCES materials for TCES are worth-
while to study, which is critical to industrial applications. Thirdly, at the
reactor scale, reactors of various configurations have been used for
calcium-based TCES to improve the performances of chemical reactions
and heat/mass transfer. However, many calciners and carbonators are
independent and discontinuous, which are difficult to integrate. The
integration of actual calciners and carbonators is promising and
worthwhile to study. Finally, at the system scale, the design and oper-
ating conditions of CaL-CSP systems have been summarized, but the
existing systematic research is scarce in pilot and large-scale experi-
mental research. Future studies should focus on the development of CSP
components such as efficient solar receivers to promote the actual
application. In addition, it is worthwhile to focus on multi-objective
optimization of systems and improve the technical and economic
values of the whole thermoelectric network.

In conclusion, the large-scale industrial application is the final goal
of investigations on the CaCO3/CaO TCES system. The system perfor-
mances are affected by TCES reactors, whose performances are further
decided by the calcium-based materials. In material research, the energy
storage performances and changes are usually explained by microscopic
the changes in microstructure are
characterizations. Furthermore,
determined by interactions at smaller scales, which are mainly evalu-
ated by electron and atomic calculations. The multiscale relationships of
calcium-based thermochemical energy storage are shown in Fig. 36.
Multiscale calculations should provide guidelines for material design
and performance improvement. Furthermore, it is urgent to find scaled-
up pathways to make modified materials to be used in reactors. With the
efforts of optimization of reactors and systems, the final goal of the
large-scale industrial application of the CaCO3/CaO TCES system will be
achieved.

This work outlines the current state of the key research on CaCO3/
CaO-based thermochemical energy storage, focusing on the atomic-scale
structure-performance relationships, material properties, reactor and
system performances. Multiscale modeling and simulations allow for the
efficient and adventurous design of calcium-based materials and their
modifications from the corresponding scales, which provides effective
tools for further performance improvements. To improve reaction ki-
netics properties, the effects of the reaction atmosphere and doped
molten salts should be studied more deeply and systematically. For cy-
clic stability, it is difficult to simply apply modification methods to
permanently restrict the sintering of calcium-based materials. Future
attention will be paid to searching for cost-effective methods to deal
with the sintered materials and recover their energy storage perfor-
mances. In addition, scaled-up pathways of high-performance modified
calcium-based materials are also required for large-scale applications. At
the reactor scale, future studies should integrate calciners and carbo-
nators to improve overall efficiency. On the premise of obtaining high-
performance materials and developing efficient solar receivers, the
design of the thermoelectric network and the multi-objective optimi-
zation of the system are needed to focus on improving the technical and
economic values of the TCES system, which will ultimately promote the
mature application of the CaL-CSP system for a sustainable future.
