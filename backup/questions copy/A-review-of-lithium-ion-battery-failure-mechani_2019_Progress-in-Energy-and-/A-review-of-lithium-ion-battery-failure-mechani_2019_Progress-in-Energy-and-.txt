Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are booming due to their high energy density, low maintenance, low self-
discharge, quick charging and longevity advantages. However, the thermal stability of LIBs is relatively
poor and their failure may cause fire and, under certain circumstances, explosion. The fire risk hinders the
large scale application of LIBs in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. This manuscript provides a
comprehensive review of the thermal runaway phenomenon and related fire dynamics in singe LIB cells
as well as in multi-cell battery packs. Potential fire prevention measures are also discussed. Mitigating
the hazards associated with a growing number of LIB applications represents a significant new challenge
for the fire safety engineering community. Some perspectives and outlooks on the future of LIB fire safety
research and safety engineering are given.

1. Introduction

For  far  too  long,  we  are  depending  on  the  fossil  fuels  to
power the industry, heat our households and drive the vehicles.
For example, the total primary energy consumption by China was
1.437 × 10 20 J in 2016 and over 88.3% of it was generated from
fossil fuels [1] . Fossil fuels are, of course, a limited resource, and
the World is facing an emerging energy crisis. It takes millions of
years to develop the fossil fuels that have been consumed during
the past 200 years. Their consumption is the main cause of many
environmental problems including the global warming, air pollu-
tion and acid rain. In 2012, the International Energy Agency em-
phasized the need for a change in the energy supply to meet the
expected shortage in oil and the concern for CO
2 -related climate
change [2] .

In  order  to  reduce  CO

2  emissions  and  help  prevent  global
warming, many alternative energy resources are being adopted to-
day,  such  as  nuclear,  hydrogen,  wind,  solar  and  geothermal  en-
ergy. Additionally, the electric vehicles (EVs) as well as hybrid elec-
tric  vehicles  (HEVs)  are  being  developed  at  a  fast  pace,  and  are
expected to replace the traditional vehicles powered by gasoline.
Lithium  ion  batteries  (LIBs)  are  seen  as  the  key  technology  that
will enable transition to EVs and thus replace the traditional vehi-
cle design based on the internal combustion engine [3] , and they
are also the most viable candidate device to store the electric en-
ergy  from  renewable  energy  in  electric  grids  [4] .  Currently,  the
dominated power sources for a variety of portable electronic de-
vices are LIBs due to their high working voltage, low memory ef-
fects, high energy density compared to traditional batteries. It is no
exaggeration to say that the LIBs are booming all over the world in
many fields.

The shortcomings of LIBs are their narrow operational temper-
ature range and charge/discharge rates [5–9] . The capacity of the
battery degrades faster if working at a high temperature, and the
lifetime is shortened, too. When LIBs are subjected to conditions
outside  of  their  design  window,  they  may  fail  through  a  rapid
self-heating or thermal runaway, which may ignite the surround-
ing materials. The LIB abuse conditions can be divided into three
categories: thermal abuse, electrical abuse and mechanical abuse.
Overheating [10] and fire exposure belong to the thermal abuse.
Overcharge [11–17] , over discharge [18] and external/internal short
circuit [19] are electrical abuse. The mechanical abuse condition in-
cludes crash, penetration and bend [20–24] .

The purpose of this review is to discuss the LIB failure mecha-
nisms and the related hazard mitigation strategies. The first part is
a brief introduction to LIB, then the main causes of thermal run-

away and fire in single LIB cells as well as in battery packs are
reviewed. Finally, the research on the fire prevention measures is
discussed and future challenges are identified.

2.1. Battery chemistry and materials

Since Sony corporation first commercialized the LIB (carbon as
anode and LiCoO
2  (LCO) as cathode) in 1991, billions of LIB cells
have  been  produced  for  portable  electronics  and  various  other
large electric devices. The four primary components of a LIB are
cathode, electrolyte, separator and anode. The anode stores lithium
ions during charging, and the lithium ions move to the cathode
during discharging to drive the electrical applications. So the LIB is
also called as "Rocking chair battery" because the lithium ions are
exchanged between the cathode and anode. The schematic of the
LIB work mechanism is shown in Fig. 1 .

2.1.1. Cathode materials

The  conventional  cathodes  contain  the  transition  metal  ox-
2  (NCA)  and
2  (NCM)  which  can  be  categorized  according  to

ides  like  LCO,  LiMn
Li(Ni x Co y Mn z )O

and is safer than NCM and LCO, but holds low capacity and low
charge/discharge rates.

The demand for the LIB’s energy density and power density is
growing continuously. Many new cathode materials with high ca-
pacity and high voltage have been identified, including Ni-rich [27–
32] , Mn-rich [33] and Li-rich [27,33–39] materials, carbon coated
LiFePO
4  nanospheres  [40]  and  vanadium  pentoxide  [41] .  Other
modified,  safer  cathode  materials  are  discussed  in  Section  5.1.1 .
There are different Li(Ni x Co y Mn z )O
2 materials according to the Ni-
content, the ratio of Ni, Co and Mn in the commercial NCM cath-
ode, x:y:z can be 8.5:0.75:0.75, 8:1:1, 7:1.5:1.5, 6:2:2, 5:2:3, 4:3:3,
1:1:1, etc. [42,43] . Increasing the contents of Ni and Li can raise the
specific capacity of the cathode material, but also leads to thermal
instability. The commercialized Ni-rich NCM materials such as the

ter thermal stability compared to the graphite anode [46] . Thus the

LIBs with Li
as stationary energy storage, where the energy density is not as
important [47] .

Similar to the cathode materials, the new anode materials with
high capacity and high voltage have also attracted significant at-
tention. These materials include Si (approximately 4140 mAh g −1 ,
but  almost  400%  volume  fluctuation  during  cycling)  [4 8,4 9] ,  Sn
(992 mAh g −1 ) [50] , Sb (Sb

these new anode materials have yet to be commercialized. Large

of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and the low capacity

[65] .

2.1.3. Electrolytes

The electrolyte is regarded as the blood of the lithium ion bat-
tery, and the pore space of the separator and electrodes is infilled

with the liquid electrolyte. During the charge (discharge) process,
the lithium ions deintercalate from the cathode (anode), and trans-
ferred  to  the  anode  (cathode)  through  the  electrolyte.  In  other
words,  the  lithium  ions  flow  freely  in  the  electrolyte.  Thus,  the
electrolyte solvents should have good physical and chemical prop-
erties to ensure the rapid lithium ion transmission, be compatible
with electrodes and chemical inert at the same time.

Commonly  used  electrolytes  consist  of  organic  solvents,  such
as ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), propylene car-
bonate (PC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) and dimethyl carbonate
(DMC),  and  salts  dissolved  in  the  solvents,  such  as  lithium  hex-
6 ), lithium hexafluoroarsenate monohydrate
afluorophosphate (LiPF
4 ), and lithium tetrafluoroborate
6 ), lithium perchlorate (LiClO
(LiAsF
(LiBF
4 ).  The  chemical  formulas  and  other  parameters  of  the  sol-
vents are shown in Table 1 , where (cid:2)H c is the heat of combustion,
f G 0 is the standard Gibbs
(cid:2)H vap is the heat of vaporization, and (cid:2)
free energy of formation. The cyclic carbonates, such as EC and PC,
have larger dielectric constant and higher viscosity; they easily dis-
solve lithium salts. Linear carbonates, such as DMC, DEC and EMC,
have lower dielectric constant, lower viscosity and higher volatility.
The dissociation of the lithium salts in these solvents needs be en-
sured, and the electrodes and separators should be wetted by the
electrolyte at the same time, thus the solvents should have high
dielectric constant and low viscosity, so the mixtures of the cyclic
and linear carbonates are often employed [66] .

Traditional commercial electrolyte composed of organic carbon-
6  offers  the  best  balance  of  electrochemical
ate  solvent  and  LiPF
performance, expense and toxicity, but it is not safe because the
organic solvents are flammable as will be discussed in Section 2.3 .
The  modifications  of  the  traditional  electrolyte  aim  to  enhance
the safety of the LIB, including more stable lithium salts [67,68] ,
electrolyte  additives  [65,69–76] ,  applying  nonflammable  solvents
[77,78] , synthesizing aqueous electrolytes [79,80] , using ionic liq-
uid [81–83] , and polymer and solid state electrolytes [65,84–87] .
The more information about the LIB’s electrolytes and their safety
can be found in Ref. [65] .

2.1.4. Separators

A separator is used to separate the cathode and anode to avoid
internal short circuit (ISC) while allowing free Li ions transfer [91] .
The separator is not an electrochemically active material, but it is
a very important component to guarantee safety. If the separator
is compromised, the battery may get into thermal runaway due to
ISC [92] . Besides, the separator also plays an important role in ion
transport and influences rate performance and cell life.

A  good  separator  should  satisfy  the  following  requirements:
chemically and thermally stable, having shutdown function at the
set temperature, good wettability and fine permeability with elec-
trolyte. Based on the structure and composition, the separators for
liquid electrolyte LIB can be broadly classified into three groups:
microporous polymer membranes (featured by their thinness and
thermal shutdown function), non-woven fabric mats (high poros-
ity and low cost) and inorganic composite membranes (very good
wettability and fine thermal stability) [93] .

The  conventional  commercial  LIB  separators  are  polyolefin
membranes  made  from  polyethylene  (PE)  or  polypropylene  (PP).
They are typically less than 25 μm in thickness and about 40% in
porosity. The common commercially available separators and their
properties are shown in Table 2 .

In  order  to  increase  the  thermal  stability  and  mechanical
strength of the separator, many new designs have been introduced,
including ceramic-coated [94–97] and multilayered [92,93,98] sep-
arators. The ceramic composite-based materials (often the oxides
of Al and Si) are coated on one or both sides of a polymer mem-
brane substrate, and the ceramic coating could improve the me-
chanical and thermal stability of the separator by decreasing the

degree of shrinkage at high temperature [92,95] . Many multilayer
separators are designed with a shutdown feature, where the two
layers have different phase change temperatures [92] . For exam-
ple,  Celgard  produced  trilayer  separator  with  PP-PE-PP  composi-
tion.  The  melt  points  of  PE  and  PP  are  135  and  165  °C,  respec-
tively.  As  the  temperature  of  a  cell  increases,  the  low  melting
component,  i.e.  PE,  melts  first  and  fills  the  pores  of  the  PP  lay-
ers, so as to stop the transport of ions and shutdown the current
in the cell [92,93,98] . When current flow is stopped, the thermal
runaway risk is reduced greatly.

In addition to the ceramic-coating and multilayer stated above,
some other new materials and designs have been introduced in-
cluding polyester fiber non-woven mats with good thermal stabil-
ity above 210 °C [92] , Silica/poly(vinylidene fluoride) porous com-
posite membranes [99] , porous-layer-coated polyimide nanofibrous
separator  [100]  and  polyformaldehyde/cellulose  nanofibers  blend
separators [101] . More information on LIB separators can be found
in Ref. [91,102] .

2.2. Single cell and battery pack

Inside  every  single  cell,  the  cathode  and  anode  materials  are
mixed  with  binder,  conductive  carbon  and  solvent  to  generate
paste. Then the paste is painted onto the current collector (gen-
erally, graphite anode is painted onto Cu foil; cathode is painted
onto Al foil). The cathode and anode are, subsequently, wounded

up into a spiral for a cylindrical cell or cut and arranged in a stack
for pouch cells. The shapes and components of cylindrical and pris-
matic LIB configurations are shown in Fig. 2 , here the cathode is
Li

4 and the anode is carbon as an example.

In some cases, such as EVs or energy storage system used in
power grid, multiple cells are packed together in various config-
urations (connected in parallel and/or series) to form a module;
the modules are combined together to meet the demand of voltage
and capacity. Typical organization of battery packs is presented in
Fig. 3 [104,105] . The battery module is composed of multiple sin-
gle cells, and the battery pack is constructed from multiple battery
modules.

The optimum operating temperature range of LIB is from 20 °C
to 40 °C [6,106] . If environmental temperature exceeds the normal
operating conditions, the risk of an LIB cell undergoing a thermal
runaway becomes significant. On the other hand, if the tempera-
ture of the battery is below the desired set point, the heat ele-
ments are also needed to raise the temperature of the battery pack
[107] . Therefore, it is important to design effective thermal man-
agement  system  to  control  both  the  maximum  temperature  and
temperature distribution in the battery pack within a proper range.
The  conventional  cooling  methods  include  air  cooling  [108–
110] , liquid cooling [111,112] , phase change material (PCM) cooling
[6,113,114] , heat pipe cooling system [115–117] or their combina-
tions.  The air cooling is  the simplest method but  with low effi-
ciency. The liquid cooling is effective but increases the weight of

the battery pack and has leakage risk. The latent heat of PCM is
high but the heat conductivity is low, which limits its effective-
ness.

The heat pipe is a heat-transfer device that combines thermal
conduction and phase transition to transfer heat between two solid
interfaces effectively. At the hot interface of a heat pipe, the liq-
uid contact with the thermally conductive solid surface vaporizes
through absorbing heat. Then the vapor flows along the heat pipe
to the cold interface and condenses back into a liquid to release
the  latent  heat.  The  liquid  then  goes  back  to  the  hot  interface
through gravity, centrifugal force, capillary action or other forces,
and thus the cycle operates. Due to the very high heat transfer co-
efficients during boiling and condensation, heat pipes are highly
effective  in  heat  transfer  [106,116] .  On  the  other  hand,  the  heat
pipe cooling method is relatively complex and costly for LIB cool-
ing system. So, developing an effective, reliable and cheap LIB cool-
ing systems is a work in progress.

2.3. Other basics of batteries

As  mentioned  in  Introduction,  there  are  many  abuse  condi-
tions which can induce LIB thermal runaway. Internal short circuit
(ISC) is the most common and intrinsic inducement among various
abuse behaviors. When large area ISC is formed inside the cell, the
electric energy is released at a high rate, which rapidly increases
internal temperature and triggers thermal runaway. ISC has been

the main cause for the recalls of LIB [118] . When the battery is ex-
posed to physical abuse, such as penetration, pinch and bend, the
two electrodes connect with each other due to the nail penetra-
tion, the fracture of separator or the deformation of the electrode
[119–129] . When the battery is exposed to electrical abuse, such
as overcharge, the lithium dendrite [130–132] develops inside and
may penetrate the separator. Manufacturing contaminants can also
lead to ISC. ISC may also be induced by thermal abuse and associ-
ated with thermal shrinkage or collapse of the separator. It should
be pointed out that thermal abuse may also trigger exothermic re-
actions within the anode and/or cathode, even if the separator re-
mains initially intact.

In  addition  to  the  energy  released  due  to  reactions  between
battery materials during thermal runaway, some organic compo-
nents may represent a significant source of energy. In particular,
the organic electrolyte solvent may ignite and burn in the pres-
ence  of  air  [133] .  Generally,  the  mass  fraction  of  the  electrolyte
is about 10% of the cell mass [133,134] . In Ribière’s study [133] ,
the  maximum  effective  combustion  heat  was  determined  to  be
4.03 ± 0.34 MJ kg −1 of cells, and the electrolyte contributed up to
1.92 MJ kg −1 .

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry [135,136] re-
sults  showed  that  the  solvents  were  vaporized  when  the  elec-
trolyte  or  battery  were  exposed  to  a  high  temperature.  It  was
further  demonstrated  that  the  mixture  of  the  aerosol  droplets,
electrolyte  vapor  and  its  decomposition  products  can  be  ignited

101

by  an  ignition  source,  such  as  an  electric  spark  and  hot  surface
[137] . Thus, it is important to know the chemistry of the organic
electrolyte solvents whose physical properties are summarized in
Table 1 . As the data indicate, EC, DMC and EMC have a low flash
point and thus can be easily ignited. The chain and cyclic organic
carbonates have different strength and weakness, so the mixture
of different solvents is chosen in practice in order to gain better
electrochemical performance.

3. Lithium ion battery fire accident analysis

If stored and operated within manufacturer-recommended lim-
its, the failure rate of LIBs is estimated to be 1 in 40 million [9] .
However, unpredictable circumstances such as overcharging, exter-
nal heating and mechanical abuse may significantly increase this
failure probability. Although various safety devices have been in-
corporated into the commercial LIB cells, there have been numer-
ous high-profile battery failure accidents, many of which caused
significant adverse impacts for the cell manufacturers as well as
companies utilizing LIB technology within their products. Table 3
lists some of the recent high-profile accidents caused by LIB failure.
This list includes a wide range of products, from small consumer
electronics to large EVs and airplanes. The root causes of these ac-
cidents include overheating, short circuit, overcharge, self-heating
or mechanical crash.

A schematic representation of potential causes of the LIB acci-
dents is shown in Fig. 4 . Due to numerous dangerous accidents in-
volving LIBs, regulations for transport and storage of these devices
have been modified. For example, the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) prohibited the shipment of LIBs as cargo on
passenger airplanes. When batteries are shipped on “cargo-only”
aircrafts their state of charge (SOC) must be less than 30% [141] .

A continuous demand for smaller and lighter electronic gadgets
drives increases in LIB energy density, which may potentially lead
to more destructive accidents. When the battery gets into thermal
runaway, it may vent and eject particulates as well as flammable
and toxic gases. And it can form jet flame and even rupture. The
lessons of the catastrophic accidents have taught us that the LIB
technology safety is a serious issue. It is, therefore, important to
understand LIB failure mechanisms in order to develop safer and
higher-energy density batteries. The thermal runaway mechanism
and fire behavior of LIBs are discussed in Section 4 .

4. Thermal runaway mechanism and fire behavior of lithium
ion battery

4.1. Thermal runaway mechanism

4.1.1. Theoretical analysis

Generally, thermal runaway occurs when the heat generated by
exothermic reactions is not offset by the heat losses to the envi-
ronment. This accumulated heat drives the temperature increase
which, in turn, produces an exponential increase in the reaction
rates. In the case of LIB, an undesirable temperature increase can
occur  within  the  battery  as  a  result  of  electrical  or  mechanical
abuse, or due to the presence of an external heating source. If the
rate of heat generation exceeds the rate of heat dissipation into the
environment, the temperature will continue rising. When reaching
some critical temperatures, especially the collapse temperature of
separator, the cell will breakdown.

The Semenov plots [142] shown in Fig. 5 can be used to fur-
ther illustrate the dynamics of the thermal runaway. The curved
line (line 4) represents the heat generation due to the exothermic
reaction (exponential function, following the Arrhenius law), while
the straight lines 1, 2 and 3 represent the heat loss under differ-
ent ambient temperatures (ambient temperature A, B and C, re-
spectively) which is a linear function following the Newton’s law
of cooling. When the ambient temperature is A, there are two in-
tersection points (E, F) between line 4 and 1, where the heat gen-
eration rate is equal to the heat loss rate. The lower point E is a
stable thermal balance point. If temperature deviates upwards, the
cooling rate is higher than the heat generation rate, so the system
will return to point E. If temperature drops, the heat generation
rate is higher than the cooling rate, so the system will return to
point E again. Point F is an unstable and also an unreachable point,
because the heat loss rate is higher than the heat generation rate
before T
1 , so the system will cool to point E rather than heat to
point F. When the ambient temperature increases to B, line 2 has
one tangent point D with line 4. At this point, the heat loss rate is
equal to the heat generation rate, and once the system temperature
increases a little, the system’s temperature will continue to rise at
a  progressively  higher  rate.  This  critical  equilibrium  temperature
is  called  the  “Temperature  of  No  Return,  T
NR ”.  And  the  ambient
temperature B is the self-accelerating decomposition temperature
(SADT). LIB can be regarded as a reaction system, in which the heat
comes from the electrochemical reactions between its components.

Fig. 5.  Temperature dependence of reaction rate and heat loss from a system at
3 ambient temperature: A, B, and C. A can control the sample temperature; B is
the critical temperature and the sample temperature can reach T NR , if the ambient
temperature exceeds B, the heat generation and losses are no longer balanced and
the system will go into thermal runaway. Reprinted from Ref. [142] .

Under different working or boundary conditions, once the battery
NR , then the LIB system will go to a thermal
temperature reaches T
runaway.

It should be noted that the Semenov plots presented here are
only a special case for LIB thermal runaway rather than a universal
model. In the realistic reaction process, the system is hard to reach
uniform temperature distribution, but Semenov model can simplify
the problem and is easy to understand. In fact, many realistic sit-
uations could be solved based on the assumption of uniform tem-
perature distribution [143] . As for LIB, a hot spot caused by inter-
nal short circuit or other reasons can induce thermal runaway, and
Semenov model cannot describe this situation. However, when the

LIB is exposed to thermal abuse conditions, if its Biot number is
less than 0.1, the temperature gradients are negligible inside the
battery, so the system could be analyzed by Semenov model [144] .
When the external heating causes the thermal runaway, and the
external heating is slow (i.e. the cell temperature is uniform), Se-
menov model is valid. Many investigators still assumed that the
temperature inside the battery was spatially uniform before ther-
mal runaway in external heating and self-heating test (conducted
by ARC) [145,146] .

4.1.2. Heat sources and basic reactions

To understand the dynamics of LIB thermal runaway, the fol-
lowing three questions must be answered. Where does the heat
come from? Where does the heat go? And how does the heat trig-
ger thermal runaway? The following section discusses the above
three questions. Heat sources inside LIB under the normal opera-
tion and thermal runaway conditions are discussed, and the failure
processes associated with three typical thermal runaway scenarios
are examined.

4.1.2.1. Heat generation in LIB during normal operation.  During the
total , W m −3 )
normal operation, the total heat generation in LIB ( Q
is composed of reversible heat generation ( Q rev , W m −3 ) by the
electrochemical reaction and the irreversible heat generation ( Q rxn ,
W  m −3 )  by  charge-discharge  cycling  as  shown  in  Eq.  (1c) .  The
overpotential  ( E oc - E ,  V)  is  an  indicator  of  irreversibility  such  as
ohmic losses, charge-transfer overpotential and mass-transfer lim-
itations, where E oc  is the open circuit potential and E is the po-
tential of cell [147–149] . So the total heat generation rate, Q
total is
equal to the sum of Q rev and Q rxn as shown in Eq. (1a), (1b) and
(1c) [147,148] :
Q rev = −IT (∂ E oc /∂T ) = −a s JF T (∂ E oc /∂T )

Q rxn = I( E oc − E) = a s JF ( E oc − E)

(mol m −2 s −1 ) is the transfer current resulted from the intercala-
tion or deintercalation of lithium, and F (C mol −1 ) is the Faraday
constant. This section states the heat generation of the battery un-
der the normal working temperature range.

4.1.2.2. Heat generation and reactions in LIB as temperature increase.
However, when the battery are exposed to abuse conditions, the
temperature may exceed the normal operating range, and the ac-
tive  materials  will  decompose  or  react  with  each  other,  finally
leading  into  thermal  runaway.  The  electrochemical  reaction  pro-
cess inside the LIB at high temperature is very complicated. Taking
LCO cell as an example, the thermal runaway process can be sum-
marized as Fig. 6 . As temperature increases, the battery undergoes
the following chemical transformations: the SEI layer decomposi-
tion, reaction between the anode material and electrolyte, reaction
between the cathode material and electrolyte, electrolyte decom-
position, and the reaction between the anode and the binder [105] .
Many of them occur in parallel.

(1) Breakdown of SEI layer

The SEI layer (solid electrolyte interphase layer) is a thin layer
formed on the graphite anode, and its formation results from irre-
versible electrochemical decomposition of the electrolyte. The SEI
layer doesn’t conduct electron, and is almost impenetrable to elec-
trolyte molecules, so it can protect the anode from further react-
ing with the electrolyte. The SEI layer is composed of two parts:

3 ) and metastable components (such
as ROCO

The SEI layer may decompose at relatively lower temperature
of  69  °C  [154] .  Besides,  the  intercalated  Li  can  also  react  with
(CH
4  [153] . The decomposi-
tion of SEI layer not only heats the battery but also followed by the
reaction between the electrolyte and carbon anode because the an-
ode loses the protection from SEI layer. According to the thermal
analysis results conducted by the C80 micro calorimeter (CALVET
calorimeters, SETARAM Scientific & Industrial Equipment Company,
6 alone
similar to differential scanning calorimetry [155] ), the Li x C
has only one exothermic peak when exposed to high temperature,

6 -1.0 M LiPF

which is attributed to the SEI decomposition [154] . However, four
6 /EC + DEC
exothermic peaks were observed for the Li x C
electrolyte system which were attributed to SEI decomposition, Li-
electrolyte reaction, new SEI film regeneration, new SEI decompo-
sition, and the reactions of Li with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)
and other reaction products. The onset temperature of the exother-
mic reaction ranged from 51–69 °C for different x carbon anode.
The heat and kinetic parameters of these reactions are reported in
Ref. [154] .

For the Li

6 /EC + DEC system, the total heat gen-
eration is 2600.9 J g −1 . When the amount of intercalated lithium
increases, the activation energy decreases, while the heat of reac-
tion increases [154] . Electrolyte is involved in most exothermic re-
actions. Besides, the organic solvents can also react with the inter-
calated lithium to release flammable hydrocarbons such as C

(3) Collapse of the separator and formation of ISC

The PE and PP separator melt at 135 °C and 166 °C, respectively,
while some ceramic coated separator may maintain their structural
integrity even after the temperature exceeds 200 °C [24,92] . How-
ever,  as  the  temperature  further  increases,  the  separator  shrinks
further and the cathode and anode may come into a contact with
each other and thus form ISC [24] . LIB self-discharges when ex-
posed to high temperature due to a gradual shrinkage of the sep-
arator and formation of a small area ISC. ISC is an important in-
ducement  of  thermal  runaway,  and  the  electric  energy  released
at thermal runaway is approximately equal to the electric energy
stored in the battery [161] . However, some investigators [162] also
pointed  out  that  LIB  could  still  fall  into  thermal  runaway  even
without ISC. The chemical crosstalk between the LIB components
was responsible for thermal runaway even in the absence of ISC
[162] . The oxygen released by cathode reacts with the lithiated an-
ode and produces large amount of heat at 274.2 °C with heat flow
of 87.8 W g −1 [162] .

(4) Decomposition of cathode and reaction with electrolyte

At higher temperature, the cathode begins to decompose and
release oxygen. In the EC/DEC solvent, the onset temperature for
self-sustained  exothermic  reactions  are  150,  220  and  310  °C  for
2 and LFP (all charged to 4.2 V vs Li metal),
LCO, Li(Ni
respectively [163] . Fig. 7 shows the different thermal stabilities of

(4.3) Decomposition of NCM

The properties of the NCM cathode depend on the ratio of Ni,
Co and Mn atoms in the oxide. Generally, high Ni-content NCMs
have  high  electric  capacity  but  reduced  thermal  stability  [171] .
Table  4  provides thermal decomposition  information for  a  range
of NCM materials.

Bak  et  al.  investigated  [42]  the  thermal  stability  of  charged
Li(Ni x Mn y Co z )O
2 cathode material with different content of Ni, Co
and Mn, finding that more Ni and less Co and Mn, the lower the
onset temperature of the phase transition and the larger amount
of oxygen release. The phase transition paths and the correspond-
ing temperatures of different cathode materials are summarized in
Ref. [42] .

NCM first converts from a layered structure (space group R  ̄3 m )
4 -type  spinel  phase
4 -type  spinel  and  M
to  disordered  LiM
(space group F d  ̄3 m ). At higher temperature (up to 600 °C), these
two disordered spinel phases co-exist in the absence of electrolyte
[172] . The electrolyte can accelerate the thermal decomposition of
the cathode material [172,173] , and the spinel is converted to MO-
type rock salt phase ( F m  ̄3 m ) and metallic phase, when heated to
600 °C [172] . Roder [47,174] proposed the following decomposition
reaction for NMC:

NCM( R  ̄3 m )

(cid:2)T , solv .
−−−−−→ (Mn , Ni)O( F m  ̄3 m ) + CoO + Ni+ O 2

(10)

During  the  lithium  extraction  from  cathode  (associated  with
charging process), Ni 2 + and Co 3 + are oxidized to Ni 3 + or Ni 4 + and
Co 4 + respectively. The amount of unstable Ni 4 + cation in NCM was
identified as the most important factor decreasing the thermal sta-
bility of cathode [42] . In addition, the oxygen release from cath-
ode is inevitable during the heat-driven reduction of Ni 4 + to Ni 2 +
[42] . The mechanism of oxygen evolution from electrode has been
discussed by several groups [175,176] . The active oxygen ions such
as O 2 −, O −, O
2  would lose electrons
to form O
2 or migrate to the material surface in high-voltage bat-
teries [175] . The oxygen gas can cause significant heat generation
by reacting with the flammable electrolyte, and that is one of the
important mechanisms by which SOC affects the probability and
severity of thermal runaway.

As these reactions take place and gaseous decomposition prod-

ing  of  a  safety  valve.  The  released  gases  may  readily  ignite  and
further  increase  hazards  associated  with  the  thermal  runaway
[137,145,191,192] .

(6) Reaction related to the binder

When the battery temperature is above 260 °C, the binder can
react with the cathode material and Li x C
6 . As for the LCO cathode
material containing PVDF binder, the PVDF binder can increase the
thermal reactivity of LCO. At elevated temperature, the formation
of surface Co
4 and dissolution of Co ions is accelerated at the in-
terface between the active material and the binder [193] . Hydrogen
fluoride,  HF,  was found  to  be  involved in  the  disproportionation

are shown in the table embedded in Fig. 8 . The greatest contribu-
tion to the heat generation is the disproportionation and decompo-
sition of cathode, and the second greatest contribution is the Joule
heat released by ISC [195] .

4.1.2.4. Thermal  runaway  mechanism  of  LIB  exposed  to  nail  pen-
etration  and  overcharge.  In  addition  to  the  thermal  abuse,  me-
chanical  and  electrical  abuse  can  also  induce  thermal  runaway.
Here, two typical failure initiation mechanisms are reviewed: nail
penetration [23,24,97,196–203] (mechanical abuse) and overcharge
[13,16,17,132,204] (electrical abuse).

(1) Nail penetration

Nail penetration tests [23,24,97,196–203] were conducted to in-
vestigate the internal short circuit of LIB. When a steel nail pen-
etrates into the cell body, the internal current path develops be-
cause  the  nail  connects  the  electrode  materials  and  current  col-
lectors; and the electrodes can also come in contact due to defor-
mation. Subsequently, Joule heat is produced at a high rate. The
heat  is  transferred  from  the  penetration  point  through  the  cell.
The  high  temperature  triggers  the  reactions  between  the  active
battery components mentioned above. Finally, the electrolyte and
electrode eject from the safety valve and penetration site to form
jet flames.

The  formation  of  a  localized  hot  spot  and  its  propagation
throughout the cell are a unique feature of the thermal runaway
induced by penetration, or by ISC [118,205] . The hot spot first ap-
pears at the penetration site or internal short circuit site, subse-
quently propagates throughout the whole cell. Maleki [118] sug-
gested that ISC at the edge of the electrode was the worst case be-
cause of its limited heat conduction to the cell can. However, other
investigators [24] also found that the center of the cell was the
worst penetration site with higher peak temperature and heating
rate, because thermal runaway propagated to other regions faster
when penetrated at center compared to penetrated at edges.

(2) Overcharge

Overcharge is also a very common electrical abuse form when
the battery management system is out of order. The failure mech-
anism of overcharge attracted considerable attention [13,16,17,204] .
As lithium is irreversibly removed from the cathode, the structure
of the cathode is changed. If further overcharged, the cathode re-
sistance  will  increase,  so  the  cell’s  temperature  rises  due  to  the
Joule heating, and the electrolyte will react with the highly oxi-
dized cathode, breaking the structure of the cathode and heat the
cell further.

Ohsaki [13] found the exothermic reaction between the cath-
ode  and  electrolyte  were  accelerated  when  the  internal  temper-
ature  exceeded  60  °C,  and  a  large  quantity  of  CO
2  evolved.  The
rapid  exothermic  reaction  of  the  delithiated  cathode  and  elec-
trolyte triggered the reaction between the overcharged anode (de-
posited lithium) and the electrolyte, which led to thermal runaway
[13] .

In the case of overcharged cathode, the reaction between NCM
and  electrolyte  becomes  much  more  rapid  with  increasing  Li +
extraction  from  the  cathode  material,  while  the  heat  generation

between the cathode and electrolyte. When SOC exceeded 180%,
the cathode reacted violently with electrolyte; the cell temperature
exceeded 200 °C and was accompanied by significant gas gener-
ation. The photos and SEM images of the electrodes and separa-
tor disassembled from the overcharged battery are given in sev-
eral manuscripts [16,17] , and it is clear that more lithium plates on
the anode as SOC increases, and the electrolyte is completely con-
sumed on the cathode in overcharged battery. An electrochemical-
thermal coupled overcharge-to-thermal-runaway model was devel-
oped by Ouyang’s group [206] . In this model, the temperature was
predicted by coupling the heat generations, i.e. Joule heat, thermal
runaway reactions and internal short circuit, as shown in Fig. 9 . It
was found that two thermal runaway reactions, i.e. the electrolyte
oxidation reaction and the reaction between the deposited lithium
and electrolyte, contributed largest to the heat generations during
the overcharge process.

4.1.3. Future challenges and research objectives

Up to this point, the mechanism of the LIB’s thermal runaway
under  thermal,  mechanical  and  electrical  abuses  have  been  ex-
amined. One important conclusion is that these mechanisms are
highly complex and dependent on details of the LIB structure as
well as abuse conditions. A considerable additional research will
be required to fully understand the thermal runaway processes.

4.2. Fire behavior

4.2.1. Comparison of the heat generation inside the battery with the
heat released in flaming combustion of ejected battery materials

As discussed in earlier sections, when the LIB is under abuse
conditions, i.e. electrical, thermal, mechanical abuse conditions or
their  combination,  it  initially  releases  heat  due  to  the  combina-
tion of chemical reactions and short circuit. Simultaneously, the LIB
ejects hot aerosols and flammable gases with a high speed when
thermal runaway occurs. If these flammable materials are ignited
in air, flaming combustion will occur. So it can be concluded that
the hazard of LIB thermal runaway is composed of the heat gener-
ation inside the battery ( P
IHG ) and heat generation in flaming com-
bustion ( P
Flame ). Stoliarov and his group [145,191,192,207] designed
a novel technique, Copper Slug Battery Calorimetry (CSBC) com-
bined with oxygen consumption calorimetry, to quantify P
IHG and
Flame  of LIB with different SOCs (0%, 25%, 50% and 100%), vari-
P
ous cathode compositions (LCO, NCM, LFP) and different form fac-
tors. The CSBC apparatus and its energy conservation statement are
shown in Fig. 10 and Eq. (29) , respectively.

In the Stoliarov’s analysis, the main assumption was that, un-
der the CSBC testing conditions, the temperature inside the battery
was spatially uniform and equal to T
slug , the temperature of the
copper cylinder housing the battery. This assumption was validated
through fully resolved numerical simulations of the CSBC experi-

runaway could be measured by recording the temperature varia-
tions of the slug and battery. When the battery went into thermal

lected and ignited with a hot wire. The exhaust from the flame
was collected to measure the oxygen consumption and combustion

In their most recent work [191] , prismatic 1880 mAh LIB cells
were examined. The cell was found to release 33 ± 1.0 kJ of en-
ergy into the cell’s body and 113 ± 19 kJ was generated due to the

combustion of the ejected battery materials. The P
Flame
of  the  18650  type  cells  with  different  SOCs  and  cathodes  were
measured in Ref. [145,192,207] . For all LIB types, the total internal
heat generation and the average rate of its production increased
with  the  increasing  stored  electrical  energy.  However,  the  rates
of these increases became smaller as the battery SOC approached
100% [145,192,207] . The main heat release during the thermal run-
away of LIB comes from three part: 1). the electric energy of short
circuit, 2). heat release of chemical reactions and 3). combustion
heat. Stoliarov’s research [145,191,192,207] showed that the com-
bustion heat was more than the sum of part 1) and 2).

4.2.2.1. Pressure  increase  and  the  amount  of  gas  generation  in  LIB
thermal runaway.  The chemical reactions inside LIB release a large
quantity  of  gases,  and  the  pressure  inside  the  battery  increases
steeply [208] , so the battery shell swells [134] or the safety valves

open. Jhu et al. utilized vent sizing package 2 (VSP2, manufactured
by Fauske & Associates, LLC, is a PC-controlled adiabatic calorime-
ter whose functions are quite the same as those of ARC, can cre-
ate adiabatic condition, measure the temperature, pressure and en-
thalpy change of the sample) to test the 18650 type LIBs [208] , and
the LIB was contained in a stainless steel (SS316) cylindrical test
can with an inside volume of 88.0 mL (inside diameter of 4.0 cm
and height of 7.0 cm), and the inner pressure of the test can was
measured. The peak pressure caused by the charged 18650 battery
2 , 4.2 V, i.e. 100% SOC) can reach 1.080 × 10 7 Pa (108.0 bar)

and the maximum pressure increasing rate is 1.036 × 10 9 Pa min −1
(1.036  × 10 4 bar  min −1 )  [208] ,  indicating  that  the  pressure  in-
creases  very  fast  and  the  battery  is  likely  to  rupture.  Lei  et  al.
[209]  developed  new  procedures  for  measuring  external  and  in-
ternal pressure change of cells when exposed to external heating.
The  external  pressure  was  measured  utilizing  a  gas-tight  cylin-
der  with  2.73  × 10 –4  m 3  (273 mL)  in  volume.  The  cell  (18650,

sure  in  the  cylinder  was  measured,  i.e.  the  external  pressure  of
the LIB. For internal pressure measurements, a pressure line con-
nected  to  a  pressure  sensor  was  inserted  into  the  cell  directly.
The external pressure increased continuously and dramatically un-
til 21 bar (2.1 × 10 6 Pa) at thermal runaway. For the internal pres-
sure,  it  could  increase  steadily  reaching  12.5 bar  (1.25  × 10 6 Pa)
but drop rapidly when the cell vented and gases were released.
Lei calculated that the amount of produced gases during the ther-
mal runaway of the LMO cell was 76.5 mmol. Golubkov [184] used
the similar procedure, and reported that 18650 cells with LCO/NCM
cathode material released gases of 265 mmol, and those with pure
NCM 149 mmol. The detailed results are summarized in Table 6 .

4.2.2.2. Gas compositions.  Three conventional methods are used to
determine  the  composition  of  the  released  gases:  1.  small  scale
thermal  analysis  tests  such  as  thermogravimetry  (TG)  and  DSC
coupled with Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrum (GC/MS) or FTIR
[135,156,158] ; 2. collecting the gases with an evacuated vessel con-
nected to GC/MS or FTIR gas analyzers [11,160,184,210–214] ; 3. in-
situ  detection  of  the  gases  released  in  an  open  space  when  the
battery is normally cycled, external heated, overcharged or under
other abuse conditions [10,11,133,136,215–221] . The first and third
methods are real-time detection while the second one is not.

3 OCHO,  HF  and  CH

The  real-time  detection  of  the  gas  release  reveals  that  the
electrolyte  solvents  are  the  main  gas  components  ejected  from
the battery before thermal runaway [136] . In addition, CO, C
4 ,
CH
3  are  detected  [11,136] .  Golubkov
[184] analyzed the composition of the sampled gases using a gas
chromatograph as shown in Fig. 11 (a). The main gases are H
2 , CO
2
and CO, and the rest are some other hydrocarbons. Somandepalli
et al. [213] also identified the volume fraction of major gas species
released from a 7.7 Wh li-ion cells (LCO/graphite) at different SOCs
(50%, 100% and 150%), and the results are shown in Fig. 11 (b).

In addition to commercial cells, Lamb et al. [222] investigated
the gas generation of the mixture of EC, DEC, DMC and EMC with
or without LiPF
6  by ARC and GC/MS. The mixture was heated to
about 400 °C, and the mole ratios of the total gas generation to
the electrolyte were measured as well as the gas composition. The
results showed that DMC was relatively stable and produced very
little gas regardless of the presence of LiPF

80% of the total gas generation for solvents DMC, EC and EMC con-

Ohsaki  et  al.  [13]  investigated  the  gas  evolution  induced  by
overcharge  at  the  cathode  and  anode  separately  using  the  H-

2  was the main component
mainly at the cathode (LCO), while H

and NCM cathode release oxygen when exposed to high tempera-
ture, so it is reasonable to consider that CO
2 and CO is generated
as a result of oxidation or partial oxidation of the carbon contain-
ing materials at cathode [184] .

The processes responsible for the release of H

between Li and binders. Du Pasquier et al. [194] used the differen-
tial scanning calorimetry to study the reactivity of carbon anodes,
and found that dry PVDF-hexafluoropropene copolymer powder re-
acts rapidly with metallic lithium or Li x C
6  at 350 °C through the
following proposed mechanism [194] :

–CH 2 –CF 2 – + Li → LiF + –CH = CF – + 1/2 H 2

(34)

In  addition  to  PVDF,  carboxymethyl  cellulose  (CMC)  is  also  a
common binder material. And the similar reaction between CMC
and Li releases H

Above all, the mechanism of the main flammable gas genera-
tion  inside  the  LIB  has  been  stated  in  detail.  In  addition  to  the
flammable gases, various kinds of asphyxiant, irritant or toxic gases
are  also  generated  when  the  battery  gets  into  thermal  runaway
or combustion. The analysis on the gas toxicity and the genera-
tion mechanism of these hazardous gases are further discussed in
Section 4.2.3.5 .

4.2.3. Jet flame and combustion
4.2.3.1. Test  apparatuses.  The  fire  behavior  of  the  LIB  has  been
investigated  by  several  groups.  Many  apparatuses,  including  fire
calorimeter [226] , cone calorimeter [221] , fire propagation appa-
ratus [133] and ISO 9705 combustion room [47,134,227] were ap-
plied to study the combustion behavior of LIB and measure HRR
based on the oxygen consumption principle [228–230] . All these
apparatuses are similar to that shown in Fig. 12 . This apparatus is
composed of heater, mass balance, hood and gas analyzers (used
for HRR measurement). Some gas analyzers such as paramagnetic
analyzer,  non-dispersive  infrared  sensor,  FTIR,  flame  ionization

stable combustion, a third cycle of a jet flame followed by stable
combustion, abatement and extinguishment as shown in Fig. 14 .
The combustion of the LIB has multiple stages and some large scale
batteries even have multiple cycles of jet flames [47,134,227] . Gen-
erally, the fire behavior of the LIB is similar to Wang and Sun’s
study, also consisting of battery expansion, jet flame, stable com-
bustion, abatement and extinguishment [134] .

4.2.3.3. Effects of SOC on the fire behavior.  SOC has enormous im-
pact  on  the  combustion  behavior  [133,134,218,226,232] .  Gener-
ally,  the  time  to  thermal  runaway  after  heating  and  the  ther-
mal  runaway  trigger  temperature  decrease  with  increasing  SOC,
indicating  that  the  thermal  stability  of  LIB  decreases  with  SOC
[133,134,226,232] .  The  peak  HRR  increases  with  SOC  ascending
[133,134,226] but the total heat release may not follow the same
rule  [133] .  For  example,  in  Ribière  et  al.  study  [133] ,  the  over-
all  heat  released  in  combustion  was  313  ± 37,  383  ± 32  and
361 ± 40 kJ for 100, 50 and 0% SOC, respectively, which are com-
parative.

SOC is a dominant factor in determining the fire behavior, and
the severity of thermal runaway increases with the increasing of
SOC for LFP battery as discussed in Ref. [134] . Jiang [232] heated
the  SAMSUNG  ICR18650-26H  M,  2.6  Ah,  LCO/graphite  battery  to
thermal  runaway.  It  was  found  that  only  gas  vented  when  SOC
was  less  than  50%,  whereas  vented  gas  and  jet  fire  formed  si-
multaneously  when  the  SOC  was  higher  than  50%.  As  SOC  in-
6 can react with solvents to generate
creases, more lithium in Li x C
flammable gases as stated in Section 4.2.2.2 . Besides, the deinterca-
lated cathode, such as LCO, NCM, can release more oxygen as the
degree of deintercalation increases [232] , thus the plated lithium
dendrite or lithium deposition on the anode would react violently
with oxygen. Chemical reaction induces greater internal pressure,
so the material can eject from the LIB and form jet flame [232] .
Divided  by  the  battery  surface  area,  Ribière  [133]  compared  the
resulting normalized HRR value (MW m −2 ) of batteries with that
of different combustibles as shown in Fig. 15 . As we can see, the
normalized HRR of 100% SOC battery is slightly lower than that
of  gasoline,  and  it  is  equivalent  to  that  of  fuel  oil  for  50%  SOC
battery.

4.2.3.4. Effects of cathode on the fire behavior.  The cathode mate-
rial also influences the combustion behavior greatly [10,226] . Wang
and  Sun’s  group  [134]  conducted  the  full-scale  burning  test  on
the  high-energy  50  Ah  LFP/graphite  battery  pack,  and  the  nor-
malized  peak  HRR  (kW  m −2 )  is  881.7 kW  m −2 ,  536.9 kW  m −2
and  229.6 kW  m −2  (normalized  by  the  battery  surface  area)  for
100%, 50% and 0% SOC LFP LIB. While the normalized peak HRR of
LMO/graphite cell is 1700 kW m −2 , 1030 kW m −2 and 220 kW m −2
for 100%, 50% and 0% SOC batteries [133] . Even at 0% SOC, the LMO
battery also underwent nearly complete combustion as all organic
materials were consumed [133] . Larsson et al. [10] put the com-
mercial  lithium-ion  battery  cells  on  a  controlled  propane  fire  to
evaluate HRR and emission of toxic gases. The test batteries had
LFP cells and conventional laptop battery packs with cobalt based
cathode. The normalized total heat release per energy capacity was
found to be 28–75 kJ Wh −1 ; the normalized maximum HRR val-
ues were 110–490 W Wh −1 . The cobalt based chemistry cells were
found to have higher normalized maximum HRR than the LFP cells.
Chen et al. [226] investigated the thermal hazards of 18650 LIBs
with different cathode chemistries: LCO and LFP. It suggested that
the LCO battery is more likely to combust vigorously as LCO re-
leases a larger amount of oxygen at high temperature compared to
the LFP. There have been many studies showing that LFP is safer
than LMO and NCM because it is a lot harder to release oxygen
[184,185,233] .

detector for other gaseous products have also been used in pre-
vious studies [10,133] .

4.2.3.2. Fire phenomenon.  When the cell is abused, the safety valve,
if the cell has one, opens because the inner pressure reaches a cer-
tain threshold, or the casing of the cell swells and breaks to re-
lieve the pressure. The electrolytes accompanied by small amounts
of gases such as CO and H
2  eject or flow outward [231] . Fig. 13
shows  the  combustion  of  evaporating  aerosol  droplets  ejected
from  an  abused  cell  [231] .  The  ambient  air  can  provide  oxygen,
and  the  electrolyte  with  flammable  gases  is  fuel.  When  the  air-
fuel mixture ratio is between the flammability limits, an ignition
spark  or  hot  surface  can  ignite  the  mixture,  thus  inducing  the
flame.

Wang and Sun’s group [134] conducted a full-scale burning test
on the large-size and high-energy 50 Ah LFP/graphite battery pack,
and the combustion behavior of 100% SOC battery pack can be di-
vided into six stages as shown in following: battery expansion, jet
flame, stable combustion, a second cycle of a jet flame followed by

4.2.3.5. Effects of electrolytes and toxic gas generation.  As shown in
Table 1 , the conventional electrolyte solvents burn readily and have
low flash points. Many investigators studied electrolytes to under-
stand combustion of this component in LIB. Harris et al. [137] ana-
lyzed the combustion chemistry on the carbonate solvents used in
LIBs through simulations; the heat release profiles as well as the
temperature profiles across a counter flow flame of the propane
and  DMC  were  computed.  The  results  show  that  DMC  has  only
half the peak HRR of the propane flame; the peak absolute tem-
peratures differ by 25%. The temperature of the DMC flame was
determined to be 1650 K. Measurement of these temperatures was

difficult due to flame instabilities [ 134 , 227 ]. The temperature of the
flame produced by 50 Ah NCM/LTO cells was found to be between
700 and 900 °C as reported in Ref. [227] . The peak temperature
of the flame was in the range of 820–1500 °C for the high-energy
50 Ah LFP/graphite battery pack [134] .

Eshetu  et  al.  conducted  a  systematical study  on  the combus-
tion characteristics of organic solvents [89] and the role of lithium
salt (i.e. LiPF

solvent  mixture  composition,  with  no  significant  impact  from
added salts. On the other hand, the fire-induced toxicity was found
to be mainly dictated by the salts.

The toxicity associated with LIB combustion and thermal run-
away [10,89,218,219,234,235] or electrolyte leakage [236] attracted
attention of many investigators. In Ref. [10] , the amount of HF re-
leased during LIB combustion was determined to be in the range
of 15 and 124 mg Wh −1 , and extrapolation of the data showed that
the potential HF release from a 10 kWh plug-in electric vehicle bat-
tery was in the range 40 0–120 0 g HF. Lecocq et al. [218] reported
that the salt anions in the electrolyte were responsible for the irri-
tant gas release during battery combustion, while the organic sol-
vents had little effects. Lecocq introduced two state-of-the-art fire-
induced toxicity indices developed by ISO TC92 SC3, i.e. Fractional

Besides, Ribière et al. [133] introduced two toxicity limit val-
ues: the IET (Irreversible effects threshold) and First lethal effects
threshold (FLET), based on the French standard [237] to evaluate
toxicity of the gases released during LIB fire [133] . They also esti-
mated battery energy values associated with IET and FLET for the
NO, CO, HCl, SO
2 and HF toxic gases (exposure time of 60 min, fire
occurring in a 50 m 3 room). Lebedeva et al. [236] investigated the
chemical toxicity associated with the accidental release of LIB elec-
trolytes into an enclosed space. The threshold amount of the elec-

4.3. Fire propagation within module

Due to the demand for high capacity associated with EVs and
ESS applications, larger and larger battery modules are being de-
signed.  For  example,  a  Tesla  electric  car  is  equipped  with  over
seven thousand 18650-type LIB cells and the total energy can reach
85 kWh. So when one cell in the pack undergoes thermal runaway,
the failure and fire may propagate throughout the pack and the
results of such propagation can be catastrophic. The total heat re-
lease by the battery module was found to be proportional to the
cell number with a power of 1.26 [238] , which indicated that the
heat release by module was not the sum of each single cell’s com-
bustion heat. The combustion of one cell can promote other cells’
combustion so as to improve the combustion efficiency and fire in-
tensity. In the following sections, the fire propagation within mod-
ule is reviewed in detail.

Generally, when thermal runaway occurs on the center cell in
the module, the thermal runaway propagation through the whole
battery pack faster compared to the case when the initiation hap-
pens at the corner [239] . In the battery module, cells are connected
in series or in parallel, and the electrical connectivity does impact
the thermal runaway propagation characteristics within the mod-
ule [240] . Ten cylindrical (18650 type) LIB were connected together
to be an equilateral triangle, and the center cell was penetrated to
initiate the thermal runaway. When the cell was connected in se-
ries, thermal runaway didn’t propagate to the surrounding 9 cells
from the center cell. However, all the cells failed when they were
connected in parallel, because the parallel configuration leads to
an external short circuit within each cell. The form factor of the
cells (such as cylindrical, prismatic and pouch) also influences the
thermal runaway dynamics. The cylindrical cell module was found
to  be  less  prone  to  the  thermal  runaway  propagation  than  the
pouch cells owing to the limited physical contact between neigh-
boring cylindrical cells [240] . The heat transfer between neighbor-
ing pouch cells was identified as the main driving force of the ther-
mal runaway.

The combination of the thermal resistances between adjacent
batteries  and  the  trigger  conditions  of  thermal  runaway  defines
the thermal runaway propagation characteristics within the mod-
ule. Feng et al. [22,205] conducted the thermal runaway propaga-
tion tests in battery module. Six batteries were put together, and
the first cell was penetrated to initiate failure. Subsequently, the
thermal runaway propagated through the cells. The experimental
setup of tests and the temperature variation are shown in Figs. 16
and 17 , respectively [22] . A model of the propagation process of
the penetration induced thermal runaway is shown in Fig. 18 [205] .
The thermal resistance between adjacent batteries is explained
in  Fig.  19  [22] ,  and  there  are  two  cells  in  one  battery.  The

away propagates further to the next battery.

When  fire  occurs,  there  are  three  paths  for  thermal  transfer
within  the  battery  module:  the  thermal  conduction  through  the
battery shells, heat conduction through the pole connector as well
as convective and radiative heat feedback from the flame to the
cell bodies as shown in Fig. 21 . According to Feng et al., the heat
are mainly transferred through the shell, and the fire has little in-
fluence on the thermal runaway propagation [22] . The heat trigger-
ing the adjacent battery to thermal runaway is less than the 12%

of the total heat release in thermal runaway of a battery. And the
heat transferred through the shell is about 10 times larger than
that through the pole connector.

In  contradiction  to  Feng  et  al.  [22] ,  Wang  and  Sun’s  group
[47]  found  that  flame  impingement  plays  a  key  role  in  the  fire
propagation  within  the  LIB  module.  In  their  large-size  battery
combustion  test,  the  battery  packs  were  arranged  in  rhombus
or  parallel  layouts  and  one  cell  was  directly  heated  by  thermal
radiation while others were protected with fireproofing board or
gypsum board as shown in Fig. 22 . The cell directly heated went
into thermal runaway first, then thermal runaway propagated to
the surrounding cells.

For  the  parallel  layout,  at  the  initial  heating  stage,  the  aver-
age temperature increasing rates of cell 5#, 6# and 7# were 2.26,

3.85 and 3.31 °C min −1 , respectively. Cell 6# ignited first and fol-
lowed by cell 5# rather than cell 7# although the temperature of
cell 7# increased faster. It could be concluded that cell 5# was ig-
nited with the impact of the flame of cell 6#. The flame impinge-
ment heated the edge of the battery, leading to a fast reaction at
the edge and transferring to the center of the battery [47] . Flame
can increase the temperature of the battery and promote the heat
transfer through the cell bodies. The flame temperature is gener-
ally above 10 0 0 °C, therefore, convective or radiative heating from
the flame may play an important role. The cell casing rupture and
intense jet flames were observed in this test and were attributed to
the violent reduction of cathode material and electrolyte according
to the full cell thermal analysis.

The fire propagation mechanism can also be understood from
the  view  of  self-accelerating  decomposition  temperature  (SADT)
[47] as shown in Fig. 23 . Chemical kinetic parameters of the NCM-
Li
12 cell thermal runaway reaction and SADT were calculated
with the aid of C80 micro calorimeter [47] . The SADT of the LIB
indicates  the  lowest  temperature  of  the  shell  that  could  induce
thermal  runaway  of  the  inner  materials.  According  to  Semenov

teries to over 139.2 °C, and the time is beyond the delay time of
thermal runaway, then thermal runaway would propagate from the
failure cell to the surrounding cells due to the self-heating reaction
inside the battery [47] .

Stoliarov’s group also investigated cascading battery failure us-
ing experiments and numerical simulations [241] . The experimen-
tal setup is shown in Fig. 24 . In Feng’s simulation work [22] , the
heat generation inside of the battery was the superposition of all
the  reaction  heats  given  in  Section  4.1.2 ,  including  the  chemical
reaction heats and Joule heat. In Stoliarov’s study [241] , the heat
source ( Q , W m −3 ) was composed of the external heating supplied
heater , W m −2 ) and the heat pro-
by the external electric heater ( Q
duction by the thermal runaway reaction ( Q r , W m −3 ). All chem-
ical  and  electrical  processes  responsible  for  the  heat  generation
inside  the  cell  were  represented  by  a  single  (global)  first-order
chemical reaction, which rate, r (kg m −3 s −1 ), was governed by a
modified  Arrhenius  expression  given  by  Eq.  (54a) .  In  this  equa-
tion,  C r  is  the  reactant  concentration  (kg  m −3 ),  T

R = 8.314 J mol −1 K −1 are reference temperature and universal gas
constant, respectively; and A (s −1 ) and E a  (J mol −1 ) are the pre-
exponential  factor  and  activation  energy.  Because  some  battery
materials were ejected from the cells during the thermal runaway,
the overall density of the cell, ρLIB , was defined as a linear function
of C r , as shown in Eq. (54b) , where ρLIB _ final was the final, exper-
imentally determined density of the failed cell. The heat produc-
tion, Q r (W m −3 ), was expressed as shown in Eq. (54c) , where h r is
the heat of reaction (J kg −1 ), which negative value represented an
exothermic process. The reaction parameters, C

are shown in Fig. 25 . The predicted cascading failure dynamics was
found to be in a good agreement with the experiments conducted
in nitrogen (i.e., in the absence flaming combustion) [241] . Thus,
it was demonstrated that the simple reaction model provides an
accurate extrapolation from the measurements on single cells per-
formed in the CSBC apparatus to the thermal runaway propagation
in complex, multicell systems.

4.4.1. Fire modeling

Many models on the thermal runaway of LIBs can be found in
the literatures [21,242–244] . Finite volume method and finite el-
ement  method  were  used  to  simulate  the  temperature  distribu-
tion in LIB cells. Hatchard et al. [243] developed a one-dimensional

predictive model for oven exposure testing. This model was subse-
quently extended to three dimensions by Kim et al. [244] .

However, comprehensive modeling of the flames produced by
the  materials  ejected  from  LIB  has  not  been  performed  to  date.
These  materials  are  mainly  flammable  gases  and  aerosols  as  in-
dicated in Section 4.2.2 . The ejection velocity and temperature of
these materials are difficult to quantify with precision. Published
studies  mainly  focused  on  the  combustion  chemistry  analysis  of
the  carbonate  solvents  used  in  LIB  [137]  or  the  mixture  of  the
vented gases at thermal runaway [11,245] . DMC is a common elec-
trolyte solvent for LIB, and it is also used as an additive to diesel
fuel  because  of  DMC’s  high  oxygen  content  [246] .  The  chemical
kinetics model of DMC combustion in an opposed-flow diffusion
flame was developed by Glaude [246] , and the reaction rate con-
stants for DMC reactions are provided in this reference. The flame
speed, ignition energy, HRR and peak temperature should be con-
sidered when choosing solvents to maximize safety.

Johnsplass et al. [245] simulated the laminar burning velocities
of the vented gases from three different kinds of abused LIBs pre-

mixed with air. The composition of the vented gas was obtained
from Golubkov’s study [184] . The Cantera 2.3.0 with GRI-Mech 3.0
mechanism was used to simulate this premixed combustion prob-
lem. The simulation results showed that the laminar burning ve-
locities for these gases are similar or slightly higher than that of
methane. The gas vented at thermal runaway burns comparable to
propane and methane, which may present a serious hazard of ex-
plosion and fires in enclosed spaces.

Similarly, Fernandes et al. [11] also calculated the typical com-
bustion parameters (laminar flame velocities, adiabatic flame tem-
perature  and  HRR)  of  the  battery  exhaust  gases  produced  as
a  result  of  overcharge  using  a  detailed  reaction  mechanism  of
flammable  gases  and  DMC  implemented  in  the  Chemical  Work-
bench Code and CHEMKIN-II. The results of these simulations are
shown in Figs. 26 and 27 .

Overall, there are multiple models of LIB thermal runaway pre-
sented  in  the  literature.  Modeling  of  the  flaming  combustion  of
the ejected battery materials including detailed hydrodynamics of
injection  has  not  been  conducted.  To  date,  investigators  mainly

4.4.2. Risk assessment

A  risk  assessment  is  a  well-established  methodology  to  esti-
mate probabilities and impacts of failure events. In the case of LIBs,
probability, severity and ratings are required for each hazard and
for each battery type/size and application/environment conditions.
The risk assessment of the LIBs is especially important for LIB ship-
ment and large-capacity energy storage systems.

There are many safety test standards and abuse testing for LIB.
They  are  used  to  determine  the  response  of  LIBs  in  the  condi-
tions outside of those for which they were designed. Majority of
the commercial cells undergo abuse testing defined by the stan-
dards.  The  most  widely  used  safety  test  standards  are:  UN/DOT
38.3 [247] , which describes the standard tests for the transport of
lithium-ion batteries; IEC (International Electrotechnical Commis-
sion)  62,133  [248] ,  which  defines  standard  tests  for  IEC-devices;
and UL 2054 [249] and UL 1642 [250] , which describe the stan-
dard tests for electronic devices. Besides these three testing stan-
dards above, the FreedonCAR [251] and Sandia [252,253] abuse test
manuals are also used to show the cell’s behavior under extreme
abuse conditions.

Larsson  and  his  group  provided  a  broad  risk  assessment  of
the  LIBs  used  in  EVs.  They  focused  on  fire  [216,254]  and  toxic
gas emissions [217,255,256] hazards, fire propagation [216,257] and
explosion  [136] .  A  summary  of  this  assessment  is  provided  in
Tables 7 and 8 [216,254] . Table 7 presents the hazards and their
sources  and  how  the  sources  typically  can  be  mitigated  or  hin-
dered (protection strategy). All hazards in Table 7 can potentially
come from any of the sources. For example, the Hazard 3#, elec-
trolyte  leakage,  may  come  from  any  source  listed  in  the  table,
i.e. external heating, external fire, mechanical cross, deformation,
penetration, short circuit no matter external or internal cell, over-
charge or overdischarge. The mitigation/protection strategy varies
with the source of the hazard, for example, if the electrolyte leak-

age  comes  from  overcharge, then  BMS  or  other  possible cell  in-
ternal cell safety mechanisms (devices) may mitigate this hazard.
In  Table  8 ,  the  same  hazards  are  presented  together  with  their
consequences as well as with possible mitigation strategies. Also
taking Hazard 3#, electrolyte leakage, as an example, this hazard
increases the risk of fire for the flammable vapors and increases
the risk of toxicity for the decomposition products. Possible mit-
igations/protection strategies are ventilation and avoiding heat or
ignition  sources.  Larson’s  risk  assessment  [216,254]  was  qualita-
tive and did not include probabilities of the examined events or
quantitative impact measures due to a lack of available field data
[216,254] .

Blum et al. [258] conducted a fire hazard assessment of LIBs
used in energy storage systems (ESSs). In Blum’s ESS battery pack,
each powerpack contained sixteen energy storage pods, and one
energy storage pod contained two modules. Each module consisted
of  approximately  450  cells  (the  cell  is  3.6 V,  2.4  Ah,  cylindrical
18650 cell). In other words, one powerpack contained 14,400 bat-
tery cells in Blum’s full-scale fire study [258] , and the cells were
all charged to 100% SOC. The cells were forced into thermal run-
away by two methods: external ignition and internal ignition. Dur-
ing the external ignition test, a propane burner system was applied
to heat the powerpack. For the internal ignition test, the batter-
ies were forced into thermal runaway at the individual cell level.
The  following  data  were  collected:  internal  and  external  power-
pack  surface  temperature,  heat  fluxes  at  different  stand-off dis-
tances from the powerpack, internal powerpack cabinet and pod
pressures, combustion products, weather conditions, projectile ob-
servations, still photography and high definition video. The flame
spread  hazards  and  products  of  combustion  hazards  were  ana-
lyzed  for  the  ESS  LIB  fire  in  Ref.  [258] .  It  was  determined  that
the temperature inside the Powerpack could reach 1093 °C due to
the fire, but the exterior temperature was much lower and would
not pose a fire spread hazard if the recommended clearance dis-
tance  of  six  feet  was  followed.  After  30 min  of  burner  exposure
of the powerpack in the external ignition test, the HF concentra-
tion was above 100 mmol kmol −1 . And the maximum recorded HF
was 26 mmol kmol −1 during the internal ignition test for the less

Mikolajczak et al. [259] assessed the potential fire hazards as-
sociated with LIBs, and this assessment could provide the guidance
for developing fire protection for the bulk storage and distribution
of LIBs or LIB-containing products. The most flammable cell com-
ponent was determined to be hydrocarbon-based electrolyte. Other
combustible  components  include  the  polymer  separator,  binders
and  graphite.  The  vent  gases  produced  during  thermal  runaway
were also found to be flammable, consisting of hydrogen, carbon
monoxide, methane, ethylene and other organic compounds. The
composition of vented gases was verified systematically by Sandia
National Laboratories [260,261] . The stored energy (electrical and
chemical) in fully charged 2–3 Ah 18650 LIB was estimated to be
300–320 kJ by adding the combustion heat of electrolyte and sep-
arator and the electrical energy stored [259] .In addition, the pack-
aging materials also had significant effect on the combustion heat
release of the LIB system.

In 2004, U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) performed
flammability assessment of bulk-packed, non-rechargeable lithium
primary batteries in transport category aircraft [262] . In 2006, they
also conducted assessment of rechargeable lithium ion cells [263] .
The FAA tests were conducted under limited airflow conditions to
simulate environment in an aircraft cargo hold or in aircraft unit
load device. Thus, the gaseous products and heat generated as a
result  of  the  battery  failures  were  largely  contained  within  the
test  chamber.  Halon  1301  Fire  suppression  tests,  cargo  liner  in-
tegrity tests, pressure pulse tests and autoignition tests were con-
ducted as discussed in Ref. [263] using either single or multiple
cells. The necessary conditions for cell ignition were determined
as  well  as  cell  fire  characteristics  and  effects  of  SOC.  Potential
hazard to aircraft caused by the battery fires was analyzed. This
report [263] contains images demonstrating test progression col-

lected with a high-speed video camera. The flame was found to be
insufficiently hot to cause ignition of adjacent cells, but the cargo
compartment liners were ignited and sustained fire. The venting of
the bulk-packed 18650 LIBs was found to raise the pressure above
6894.76 Pa limit and compromise the integrity of the compartment
[263] .

4 ) and pouch-type (cathode is LiCoO

In 2010, the FAA released a report on flammability assessment
of  lithium ion  batteries designed for  aircraft power  usage  [264] .
Fire exposure tests, pressure pulse tests, external short-circuit test
and  auto-ignition  tests  were  conducted  both  on  cylindrical-type
(cathode is LiFePO
2 ) lithium
ion battery. The failure processes of these two type LIBs were dif-
ferent. When the cylindrical cells vented, the electrolyte sprayed
forcefully  and  ignited,  resulting  in  temperature  and  pressure  in-
creasing. If the cell’s internal pressure increased at a rate that ex-
ceeded the capability of the cell’s relief mechanism, the battery cell
would explode. For pouch cell, it didn’t have vent locations, but the
seam around the perimeter of the cell would open and expose all
flammable electrolyte at once to the fire source, which significantly
increased the size of the existing fire. The pouch-type battery pro-
duced significantly higher temperature and pressure increase due
to higher energy density and capacity compared to the cylindri-
cal  cell  (8  Ah  per  pouch-type  cell  versus  1.2  Ah  and  2.3  Ah  for
the cylindrical Li-ion cells) [264] . As stated above, FAA compared
the combustion behaviors of cylindrical-type and pouch-type cell
designed  for  aircraft  power  usage,  besides,  they  also  found  that
the  short  circuiting  of  the  cell’s  terminals  failed  to  cause  ther-
mal  runaway  in  their  study.  In  the  autoignition  test,  the  100%
SOC  cells  were  placed  in  an  autoignition  test  chamber,  and  the
temperature rose steadily within the test chamber. It was found
that the ignition temperature (i.e. the temperature within the au-
toignition test chamber) for cylindrical cells ranged from 226.7 to
275.0 °C, and the ignition temperature for the pouch cell was at
165.6–171.1 °C.

To summarize, the risk assessment of LIBs has been conducted
in the fields of energy storage system, aircraft and bulk packag-
ing  and  shipment.  The  flammability  of  the  LIBs  stored  in  differ-
ent forms and the potential hazard of LIB fire to the surroundings
were the main focuses of the investigators. The essential probabil-
ity and impact of LIB failure events were not assessed in a fully
quantitative manner due to limited incident statistics. The analysis
of risk of LIB fire is still at early stages. More information on large
scale LIB system failures is required to accurately assess the risk
associated with the deployment and long-term use of LIB based
systems.

5. Fire prevention of lithium ion battery

As indicated in previous sections, heat and flammable and/or
toxic  gas  production  are  the  two  basic  factors  to  determine  the
hazard  of  the  battery  failure.  Consequently,  the  safety  of  a  bat-
tery system can be improved by first avoiding the condition lead-
ing to heat and gas generation, and secondly by managing the heat
and gas generation to alleviate the effects of failure. The design of
safer LIB cell can be achieved either through improving stability
via modification of chemistry and/or structure or via addition of
internal safety devices. Alternatively, the safety of LIB-containing

systems can be improved by equipping them with effective ther-
mal management and/or fire suppression.

5.1. Inherent safety methods

Significant  effort s  have  been  made  to  modify  of  LIB  compo-
nents to improve safety. The modifications can be divided into the
following categories: modifications of the cathode, anode or elec-
trolyte.

In  addition  to  coating  method,  substitution  of  certain  metals

to  improve  its  thermal  stability.  Ni  and  Al  can  be  used  to  par-

TGA,  MS  and  XRD  [270] .  The  de-lithiated  Li

was  found  to  have  less  mass  loss  and  lower  heat  generation
compared to Li(Ni
2  due in part to the stability of
intermediate  crystalline  phases  produced  during  delithation  and
high  temperature  annealing  [270] .  Zhou  et  al.  [271]  synthesized
a  novel  composition  Li[Ni
2  which
(1/3 + 0.07) Mn

showed good thermal stability compared to Li(Ni

crucial role to obtain outstanding cycling stability at high temper-
atures. Zhou et al. [274] proposed a kind of spherical or spherical-
like  cathode  material  for  lithium  ion  battery,  and  the  chemical
formula of the cathode material was Li a (Ni x Co y Mn z )M
2 , wherein

from  the  group  consisting  of  Mg,  Ti,  Al,  Zr,  Y,  Co,  Mn,  Ni,  Ba
and  other  rare  earth  elements.  The  lithium  battery  prepared  by
the  obtained  cathode  material  has  high  specific  capacity,  high
temperature stability, excellent safety and cycling performance at
high temperature.

Anode  modification  includes  surface  modifications  [275]  and
electrolyte additives [276–278] . Jung et al. [275] used ultrathin di-
rect  atomic  layer  deposition  on  anode,  and  the  results  showed
that Al
3  atomic layer deposition could improve the safety per-
formance  of  the  natural  graphite  composite  electrodes.  Some
novel phosphamide additives such as N,N-diallyic-diethyoxyl phos-
phamide could improve the thermal stability of SEI layer [276,277] .
Drews et al. [278] introduced a reserve material into the graphite
which could help inhibit lithium plating on the anode when the
primary graphite material has been fully intercalated so as to im-
4 N,
prove battery safety, and the reserve material could be SrO, Mn

In addition to graphite, several new materials were used for LIB
anode.  Silicon  has  a  low  discharge  potential  but  highest  known
theoretical  charge  capacity  (4200  mAh  g −1  [279] ).  However,  the
volume of the silicon changes 400% upon insertion and extraction
of lithium, which may cause the structural damage and capacity
fading [280] . Chen et al. [280] proposed to use silicon nanowires
as high performance LIB anode material. The silicon nanowires are
able to withstand large mechanical strains; they provide good elec-
tric contact and are relatively good conductors. Besides, the spinel
lithium titanate, Li
4 (LTO) [46] was also proposed as an-
ode material. Yao et al. [46] reported that at 60 °C, the graphite
lost its capacity, while Li
4 capacity remained unchanged

with LiPF
4  with that of graphite using
stability of the lithiated Li
ARC and micro calorimeter. The results confirmed that Li
1.67 O

was safer than graphite. Many investigators had shown that LTO
was  safer  than  graphite  using  analysis  of  gas  generation  at  ele-
vated temperature, calorimetric data [45] or battery thermal run-
away tests [22,47] .

5.1.3. Safe electrolyte

As stated in Section 2.3 , the organic solvents are the main fuel
[69]  for  the  flaming  combustion  process  initiated  as  a  result  of
LIB thermal runaway. If the carbonate content is reduced, the elec-
trolyte out-gassing can be minimized when the cell is exposed to
temperatures above 100 °C [281] . Lithium salts found in the elec-
trolyte,  for  example,  the  LiPF
6 ,  can  react  with  solvents.  This  re-
action has a negative impact on the thermal stability of lithiated
graphite as well as charged cathode [282–284] . Here we discuss
the most common approaches to the improvement of electrolyte
safety: electrolyte additives, ionic liquids and solid polymer elec-
trolytes. More information on this topic can be found in Ref. [65] .

5.1.3.1. Electrolyte  additives.  A  number  of  electrolyte  additives
[65,69–76]  were  tested  for  their  ability  to  improve  the  thermal
stability or overcharge protection efficiency of the electrolyte and
LIB cells. Zeng et al. [69] indicated that safer LIBs can be obtained
by combining nonflammable phosphonate electrolyte, LFP cathode
and alloy anodes. The phosphonate electrolyte has electrochemi-
cal compatibility and strong fire-retardancy, and the LFP and an-
ode materials in this electrolyte show similar charge-discharge per-
formances  with  those  in  the  conventional  electrolyte.  Xu  et  al.
[70]  synthesized  a  novel  fluorinated  alkylphosphate,  tris(2,2,2-
trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFP), as a flame-retardant cosolvent for
Li-ion cell electrolytes, and the nonflammable electrolyte formu-
lated with less than 20% TFP performed well in LIBs. Gogotsi et al.
[74] invented a novel method to suppress the lithium or sodium
dendrite  growth  by  adding  nanodiamonds  and  other  nanoparti-
cles into conventional electrolytes. Ergen et al. [75] embedded the
boron nitride aerogels (BNAG) and boron nitride nanotube (BNNT)
into an electrolyte, and found that it could increase the electrolyte
temperature stability. The cells with BNAG modification could op-
erate up to 190 °C with over 500 cycles, and the BNNTs helped the
cells operate up to 145 °C.

The  fluorinated  cyclotriphosphazene (FCPN)  was  shown  to  be
effective in im proving the thermal stability of charged LCO [71] .
Addition  of  vinylene  carbonate  (VC)  was  also  found  to  improve
thermal  stability.  It  was  determined  that  VC-induced  SEI  com-
prises  polymeric  species  and,  therefore,  is  stable  enough  to  re-
sist thermal damage [285] . A thermally polymerizable monomer,
1,1 (cid:3) -(methylenedi-4,1-phenylene) bismaleimide (BMI) has also been
shown  to  be  a  good  electrolyte  additive  for  thermal  shutdown
[286] . At 110 °C, BMI additive polymerizes to cause the rapid solid-
ification of the electrolyte, which stops the ion transport between
electrodes. Trimethyl phosphite (TMP(i)) and trimethyl phosphate
(TMP(a)) were used as electrolyte additives and were shown to en-
hance the thermal stability of the electrolyte. TMP(a) caused some
degradation of the electrochemical performance, while the TMP(i)
improve it [287] . It was also shown that phosphazene-based flame
retardants can improve LIB safety, according to the flame exposure
tests, overcharge tests and overheating tests [288] .

5.1.3.2. Ionic  liquids  and  solid  polymer  electrolytes.  In  addition  to
electrolyte additives [69–73] , the traditional electrolytes were re-
placed with ionic liquids [81–83] or all-solid polymer electrolytes
[84–87] to improve the safety of LIBs. The ionic liquids are com-
posed of ions; the coulombic forces between the ions are strong;
and these substances are consequently very viscous and have low
vapor pressure. The low vapor pressure makes ionic liquids hard to
ignite, but their high viscosity relatively low electric conductivity,
and incompatibility with other battery materials makes them less
than an ideal choice for the electrolyte replacement.

The solid polymer electrolyte is regarded as one of the feasi-
ble  solutions  for  the  fire  risk  of  high  power  lithium  or  sodium
ion batteries. Solid polymer electrolytes do have some advantages
compared with the liquid electrolytes including non-volatility, low

123

flammability, easy processability, and electrochemical and chemi-
cal stability. Moreover, solid polymer electrolytes can eliminate the
need for extensive sealing in batteries production and reduce fi-
nal cost [85] . Youcef et al. [85] introduced a method to prepare
a solid polymer electrolyte based on modified cellulose. In other
studies,  aluminate  ester  (Al-PEG)  and  dimethoxy  ethylene  glycol
were added into the all-solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) as plasti-
cizer in order to increasing the ionic conductivity of polymer elec-
trolyte [84] . The charge/discharge properties of the nonflammable
LTO|SPE|LFP cell were found to be acceptable as reported in Ref.
[84] .

5.1.3.3. Future challenges and research objectives.  The introduction
of additives may lead to the capacity fade or worse cycle perfor-
mance for LIBs. Finding electrolyte  additives that improve safety
without  causing  degradation  of  the  battery  electrochemical  per-
formance remains a challenge. It should also be pointed out that
the design and characterization of the new electrolytes has been
mainly  based  on  the  laboratory-scale  coin  cells  [69,71,285–287] .
A considerable additional development effort will be required to
scale up these safe electrolyte technologies to commercial LIBs.

5.2. Safety devices

The conventional safety devices [289] incorporated into the LIB
include safety vents, current interrupt device, positive temperature
coefficient  device,  shutdown  separator  and  battery  management
system.

5.2.1. Safety vents and current interrupt device

Safety vents open in response to the pressure increase inside
the  cell,  and  let  the  gases  escape  so  as  to  avoid  cell  rupture
[290,291] . The vent opening is an endothermic process because of
the vaporization of electrolyte and gas expansion, thus it can cool
the cell and reduce the risk of further temperature increase [292] .
In addition, the safety vents can also act as a current interrupt de-
vice. The aluminum plate is a part of the positive terminal, and
when the pressure builds up inside the cell, the aluminum plate
will displace away from the positive terminal thus break the cir-
cuit and prevent current flow.

5.2.2. Positive temperature coefficient device

[9,289] . The PTC device often consists of a polymer containing con-
ductive particles that complete a circuit in the safe temperature
range. When the temperature reaches above this range, the poly-
mer melts and breaks the circuit [293] . This device is also triggered
when the cell temperature rises above the safe range due to exter-
nal heating.

5.2.3. Shutdown and ceramic-coated separator

The  common  polymer  separators  are  PE  and  PP  with  melt-
ing  point  of  135  and  165  °C,  respectively  [92,93,294] .  The  shut-
down separator can close the pores and thus stop the ion current
flow. Generally, the shutdown separator usually refers to multilayer
films, where two of the layers with different phase-transition tem-
peratures are combined [92,93] . For examples, PE and PP layers can
be combined to increase safety by allowing melting of PE to fill the
pores of PP layer so as to close the ionic conduction pathways at
temperature below the onset of thermal runaway [93] .

In addition to the shutdown separator technology, the ceramic-
coated separators have been developed [91,94–97,295–297] and ap-
plied  to  improve  the  separator’s  resistance  to  high  temperature.
Shi et al. [95] determined thermal shrinkage of the ceramic-coated
separators by measuring the area change after being exposed to
various  high  temperatures  for  0.5 h;  the  shrinkage  was  defined
as the ratio of the area change to the original area. The thermal
shrinkages of the ceramic-coated separators were 29.3%, 12.7% and
2.5% at 145 °C when the coated layer is 3 μm, 6 μm and 9 μm thick,
respectively. The uncoated PE separator had a thermal shrinkage of
63.5%. Thus, the ceramic coating can help maintain the integrity of
the separator and delay its collapse.

5.2.4. Battery management system

To insure that LIBs are not exposed to abnormal temperatures
or electrical loads, BMS is incorporated into a battery module or
single cell. BMS monitors the state of the battery and/or its envi-
ronment [298] . The BMS system could be electronic or mechanical
in nature and could be used to service a pack, module or a single
cell. BMS may have a wide range of functions including estima-
tion of the SOC, depth of discharge, state of health, and state of
function, protection of the battery from overheating and data re-
porting. More information on BMS and its functions can be found
in Ref. [298] .

To protect against unwanted high current, potentially caused by
an external short circuit, a positive temperature coefficient (PTC)
current limiting material is frequently integrated into an LIB cell

Fig.  28  summarizes  the  response  of  the  safety  devices  to
various  forms  of  abuse.  Together,  these  devices  can  signifi-
cantly improve LIB operation safety. However, not all devices are

incorporated in every battery. For example, current interrupt de-
vice (CID) and safety vents are not used in pouch cells. While BMS
may  help  protect  from  external  heating  and  prevent  overcharge
or overdischarge, but it does not eliminate the possibility of ISC,
which may be caused by a range of factors including a manufac-
turing defect. Thus, a reliable ISC detection algorithm needs be de-
signed in BMS to help mitigate consequences of this form of fail-
ure.

5.3. Fire suppression and cooling

5.3.1. Fire detection

With the increasing demand for high capacity, the LIB modules
become progressively larger and higher in energy density. The fire
propagation through the module can cause significant, potentially
catastrophic damage. Is it possible to detect such fire and deploy
active fire suppression to minimize the damage? In this section,
we attempt to answer this question.

Detection of LIB fires has been examined in Ref. [299] . It has
been  shown  that  an  ordinary  heat  detector,  smoke  detector  and
smoke-heat detector can detect the ignition of the Li
12  bat-
tery, and that the activated speed of the smoke-heat detector is
the fastest, while the heat detector is the slowest. These findings
suggest that the heat detector is not suitable for the detection of
LIB fire, and the smoke detector is recommended.

5.3.2. Fire extinguishing agents and methods

There are four basic approaches to suppression of a typical fire:
isolation method, smothering method, cooling method and chem-
ical suppression method. LIB fire is not a typical fire because at
least a portion of it consists of direct reactions between battery
components. These reactions do not require external oxygen. Wa-
ter is the cheapest and most widely used extinguishing agent in
a wide range of fire extinguishing systems. However, according to
Ref. [300] , at least 6 min of continuous water application was re-
quired to fully suppress the EV fire; and the fire suppression pro-
cess  lasted  for  20 min  in  FM  global  warehouse  fire  experiments
[301] . At the same time, the salt in the electrolyte, LiPF
6 , can re-
act with water to release a large amount of HF which is toxic and
harmful to people [217] . Besides, lithium can reduce water to form
highly flammable hydrogen [302] . Lastly, water is conductive and
may create external short circuits in a battery system, which, in
turn, may induce LIB thermal runaway. On the other hand, water
is a perfect cooling agent because of its high heat of vaporization
and heat capacity. It may not only help suppress flaming combus-
tion but also may be able to slow down or stop propagation of the
thermal runaway.

The  water  mist

[10,217,303–307] ,  firefighting

foams
[306,307]  and  powders  [305,307,308]  are  also  important  fire
extinguishment  agents,  and  their  suppression  efficiency  in  the
LIB  fire  is  attracting  more  and  more  attentions.  Zhang  et  al.
[305] found that the inhibition ability and cooling efficiency of the
water mist were higher than the powder on the LIB fire. Besides,
the  water  mist  spray  time  node  was  required  to  be  as  close  as
possible to the initial time of the first rupture of LIB [303] . The
application  of  water  mist  could  increase  the  HF  production  rate
temporarily, but didn’t change the total amount of HF production
[10,217] . Adding surfactant can improve the fire extinguishing per-
formance of water mist, and the surfactant can also help absorb
the flammable gases including CH

4 and CO [304] .

Li et al. [307] compared the fire-extinguishing efficiency of ABC
powder,  the  carbon  dioxide,  aqueous  film-form  foam  and  water
2 lithium ion battery pack (10 Ah ×4).
mist on the 18650-type LiCoO
The ABC powder, carbon dioxide and 3% aqueous film-form foam
were able to extinguish the open flames of the LIB pack, but the

re-ignition couldn’t be avoided. The higher the agent’s cooling ca-
pacity, the later the re-ignition happened (re-ignition time: 10, 8
2 , ABC pow-
and 45 s after the extinguishment of open flame for CO
der and 3% aqueous film-form foam agents, respectively). However,
on the condition of 2.0 L min −1 m −2 spraying intensity and 2.4 m
nozzle height, the water mist system couldn’t suppress the LIB fire
in their experiments.

CO

2  is  not  an  effective  extinguishing  agent  for  LIB  fires.  The
suppression efficiency of CO
2 is low as it is not able to cool down
the battery [302] . Halons have been shown to be able to partially
suppress an LIB fire [263] , but as the application of Halons ceased,
the temperature of the cell continued to increase [264] and the
agent cannot enter the cell casing. It was also shown that Halons
did not prevent reignition of the lithium ion polymer battery in a
fire test [264] .

Since  2010  Stockholm  convention,  Halons  have  been  phased
out as a fire suppression agent due to its impact on the Earth’s
ozone layer. A number of replacements were proposed including
heptafluoropropane.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  heptafluoro-
propane  is  an  ideal  substitute  for  alkyl  halide,  and  heptafluoro-
propane does not lead to ozone depletion. Heptafluoropropane was
12 battery fires as well as
demonstrated to suppress single Li
fires of small battery packs effectively, and the extinguishing pro-
cess required only 6–25 s of the agent application [309] . However,
it was also observed that the battery fire might reignite because
exothermic chemical processes inside the cells continued through-
out  the  agent  application  process.  Therefore,  it  is  recommended
that the heptafluoropropane fire extinguishing agent be applied as
early as possible. Defining the optimum concentration of the agent
will require further investigation [309] .

Wang  and  his  group  introduced  a  clean  agent  named

chemical  formula:  CF

6 F-ketone  was  environmentally  friendly  and
has  excellent  suppression  performance.  It  has  zero  ozone  deple-
tion potential, and is not electrically conducting in either liquid or
gaseous states, so it may be a good candidate agent to extinguish
the battery fire. The fire of Li
12 battery could be extinguished

finding  an  optimum  agent  for  LIB  fire  suppression  will  require
considerable additional research effort.

5.3.3. Future challenges and research objectives

To summarize, water remains a good candidate for LIB fire sup-
pression  due  to  its  strong  cooling  effect  and  despite  its  poten-
tial impact on integrity of electrical circuits. Halons, heptafluoro-
6 F-ketone can be used to extinguish the LIB fire ef-
propane, and C
fectively, but lack cooling effect that helps mitigate reignition or
propagation of thermal runaway. Wang’s group [308] found that
water agent showed the best cooling efficiency in their tests, fol-
lowed by C

6 F-ketone, heptafluoropropane, ABC powder, and CO

2 .

The agents with a high heat capacity (such as water and foam)
can provide rapid cooling and fire extinguishment. On the other
hand, agents with lower heat capacity (such as powder and inner
gases)  will  provide  less  cooling.  Besides,  the  agents  with  a  high
viscosity may not be able to penetrate inside the module to the
burning cells, thus the suppression is limited [306] . Currently, the
conventional fire-extinguishing agents are unable to stop the ther-
mal runaway reactions inside the LIB, but the application of agents
can extinguish the open flame and decrease the surface tempera-
ture of LIB, and thus reduce the heat transfer to the adjacent virgin
cells and, potentially, prevent the propagation of thermal runaway.

The application of fire-extinguishing agent can help win sufficient
time for people to escape and evacuate [308] .

The work on LIB fire suppressants is far from complete. Envi-
ronmentally friendly and more effective suppressants for LIB fire
still need to be identified. Faster and more accurate detection de-
signed specifically for this type of fire will also be required. The fu-
ture automatic fire suppression systems must be capable of putting
out a large-size battery pack fire and be able to cool down the pack
quickly;  preferably,  with  minimum  damage  to  the  battery  pack.
The automatic and secondary fire extinguishing systems need to
be designed and installed on EVs and ESS.

6. Summary and future outlook

Safety  issue  is  still  the  main  obstacle  to  the  usage  of  LIBs
in  large  scale  applications,  such  as  EVs  and  energy  storage  sys-
tems.  Thermal  energy  released  as  a  result  of  internal  short  cir-
cuit and chemical reactions between battery components are the
main heat sources inducing thermal runaway. The chemical reac-
tions and their onset temperatures are summarized in this review.
The decomposition of electrolyte, and reactions between the ac-
tive materials, especially the intercalated lithium with solvents, can
release  various  flammable  gases  including  H
2 ,  CO  and  hydrocar-
bons.  The  flammable  gases  and  solvent  vapors  mixed  with  oxy-
gen can be ignited and lead to a fire. Multiple jet flames can be
observed during the LIB fire. However, batteries with different ge-
ometries, different electrodes and electrolytes may show different
failure features. The occurrence and progression of thermal run-
away  also  depends  on  SOC  and  abuse  conditions.  Details  of  the
chemistry and physics of the thermal runaway are subject ongo-
ing investigations. In the future, the new advanced technologies,
including  in-situ  tests  [311,312] ,  direct  observation  [198] ,  X-ray
computed tomography [313] and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) [313,314] can be used to improve our understanding on LIB
failure dynamics.

At present, it is difficult to conduct a realistic risk assessment of
LIB systems. Thermal runaway tests and combustion tests of large-
scale LIBs and modules are necessary to provide missing data. In
addition,  the  standards  for  safe  transportation  and  fire  suppres-
sion of LIB systems need to be established. Large-scale fire tests are
costly and difficult. Therefore, simulations of LIB fires may proof to
be an economical alternative to these experiments, provided that
the simulations are carefully validated.

While many safety devices are currently used inside LIB cells,
development of more stable electrodes, electrolyte and separator
materials appear to be the most intrinsic way in which LIB safety
concerns can be addressed. Design safer electrolytes and electrodes
with good electrochemical performance and thermal stability is a
work in progress.

LIB  packs  are  expected  to  further  increase  in  capacity  and
size  in  response  to  increasing  demand  and  continuously  widen-
ing  range  of  applications.  New  generation  of  LIB  chemistries  is
under development including Li-rich [37] batteries, Ni-rich batter-
ies [28,315,316] , silicon anode batteries [317] , Li-S [318–320] and
Li-oxygen  batteries  [321] .  Design  of  more  reliable  and  compre-
hensive  battery  management  systems  will  be  an  important  fu-
ture  challenge.  Thermal  management  [322–324]  and  other  man-
agement  systems  need  to  be  more  sophisticated.  A  quicker  and
more  accurate  detection  algorithm  for  ISC,  as  well  as  an  algo-
rithm for estimating SOC [325,326] , state of health [325,327–331] ,
capacity  [332]  and  fault  diagnosis  [333]  should  also  be  a  focus
of  future  research  and  development  efforts  [334–337] .  New  au-
tomatic fire extinguishing systems targeting LIBs must be devel-
oped to insure high level of safety for present and future LIB-based
technologies.
