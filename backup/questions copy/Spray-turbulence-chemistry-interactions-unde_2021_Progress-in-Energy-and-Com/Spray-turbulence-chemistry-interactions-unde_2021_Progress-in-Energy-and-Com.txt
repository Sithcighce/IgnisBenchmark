1. Introduction 

Turbulent  multiphase  combustion  plays  an  important  role  in  both  nature  (e.g.,  volcanos  and  pool  fires)  and 
industry (e.g., industrial furnaces, aeroengines, and internal combustion engines). It is a highly complex mul-
tiscale and multi-physicochemical process in which interactions between the dispersed and continuous phases, 
phase  change,  droplet  collisions,  evaporation,  mixing,  heat  transfer,  and  chemical  reactions  occur  simulta-
neously. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of spray flames 
and their behaviors in combustion engines. This paper covers key and representative developments in the area of 
turbulent  spray  combustion  with  a  focus  on  spray–chemistry–turbulence  interactions.  The  effects  of  turbu-
lence–chemistry, spray–turbulence, and spray–chemistry interactions on the spray process, ignition, flame sta-
bilization  and  emission  are  comprehensively  discussed  at  elevated  pressures  and  temperatures.  Furthermore, 
spray–radiation  and  spray  flame–wall  interactions,  which  are  important  to  engine  performance  and  emission 
characteristics, are scrutinized. Supercritical spray flames and turbulent spray flames in dual-fuel engines are also 
discussed. Finally, outlooks and further challenges for the research field are outlined.   

liquid fuel is injected from a pressure-swirl atomizer, generating a high- 
velocity  jet.  Then,  primary  atomization  and  secondary  atomization 
follow. Droplet heating and vaporization in the dilute downstream re-
gion occur because of the heat exchange between the cold fuel droplets 
and surrounding  hot gas,  including hot combustion products. Finally, 
ignition  is  triggered  when  the  suitable  temperature  and  equivalence 
ratio are attained. Ignition involves single droplet combustion, distrib-
uted  combustion,  and  diffusion  flame  with  an  extinction/re-ignition 
process.  A  cool-flame  may  exist  in  the  upstream  of  the  nonpremixed 
flame, which is distinguished by the formaldehyde (CH2O) mass frac-
tion, while the high-temperature diffusion flame can be identified by the 
OH field. Overall, spray flames in these devices are characterized by the 
phenomena  of  spray–turbulence–chemistry  interactions,  although  the 
macro-features of these flames have some differences. 

A prime example of liquid fuel spray combustion is found in diesel 
engines,  which  have  been  widely  utilized  in  the  transport  industry, 
stationary applications (e.g., construction and small power generation), 
and agriculture. The spray flames in diesel engines occur under high- 
temperature  and  high-pressure  conditions.  However,  to  meet  the 
increasingly  stringent  legislation  on  engine  efficiency  and  pollutant 
emissions,  especially  NOx  and  particulate  matter,  a  new  low- 
temperature  combustion  (LTC)  concept  has  been  proposed  in  recent 

Turbulent multiphase combustion plays a critical role in both nature 
(e.g., volcanos and pool fires) and industry (e.g., industrial furnaces, gas 
turbine  engines,  and  internal  combustion  engines).  In  particular,  the 
combustion of liquid fuels is the main process of generating energy for 
land, air, and sea transportation industries [1]. The engine performance 
and emission characteristics of both continuous-combustion systems and 
reciprocating  internal  combustion  engines  are  strongly  influenced  by 
the characteristics of the turbulent spray combustion involved. Turbu-

decades,  which  has  led  to  several  advanced  technologies  such  as  ho-
mogeneous charge compression ignition, premixed charge compression 
ignition  (PCCI),  and  reactivity  controlled  compression  ignition  [7]. 
Unlike traditional diesel combustion, LTC employs a long ignition delay 
(ID) to provide sufficient time for fuel–air mixing to achieve high effi-
ciency  and  low  emissions  by  utilizing  high  compression  ratios  and 
exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) strategies. Recent studies have shown 
that the combustion and pollutant formation processes using the LTC 
strategy are significantly different from those in the conventional com-
bustion  mode  [7,8].  The  LTC  strategy  involves  a  two-stage  ignition 
process, which includes cool flames in a prolonged first-stage ignition 

and high-temperature combustion (HTC) in the second stage. It should 
be  noted  that  turbulence–spray–chemistry  interactions  are  more 
important for LTC, as a slow combustion process is more susceptible to 
the  influence  of  turbulence,  and  the  separation  of  chemistry  and  tur-
bulence  scales  is  no  longer  justified.  For  example,  in  predicting  the 
autoignition process in LTC diesel combustion, considering the effect of 
the turbulence–chemistry interaction results in better agreement with 
experimental data, especially under low temperature and/or low oxygen 
concentrations [9-11].

1.1. Features of turbulent spray flame 

Spray–turbulence–chemistry  interactions  determine  the  perfor-
mance  of  combustion  devices  with  respect  to  flame  stabilization  and 
pollutant  emissions  [12,13].  The  typical  characteristics  of  turbulent 
spray  flames  are  displayed  in  Fig.  2  [5,14,15],  which  involve  the 
following:  

(1)  Spray structures: Turbulent spray characteristics, such as liquid 
and vapor penetrations and spray morphology, are determined by 
the  liquid  fuel  properties,  injection  parameters,  and  ambient 
conditions.  

(2)  Ignition  or  low-temperature  reactions:  Ignition  in  a  cool  flame 
stage  with  LTC  can  be  observed;  the  fuel–air  mixture  starts  to 
react  and  long-chain  hydrocarbon  radicals,  as  well  as  smaller 
radicals, such as H2O2, HO2, and CH2O, are formed in the rich- 
mixture region of the spray tip.  

(3)  HTC:  The  low-temperature  reactions  precede  the  second-stage 
ignition, during which high-temperature reactions and diffusion 
flames lead to the formation of ignition kernels with key oxida-
tion products, such as OH, CO, and H2O.  

(4)  The  spray  flame  achieves  a  quasi-steady  state:  the  cool  flame 
located upstream of the diffusion flame is distinguished by the 
CH2O mass fraction and the HTC region of the diffusion flame is 
represented by the high-concentration OH field. 

Spray structures 

Using liquid sprays is very effective in controlling the combustion 
process  to  improve  engine  performance  and  reduce  emissions.  Spray 
injection can be divided into a series of sub-processes, involving cavi-
tation within the injector, the primary and secondary breakup of a liquid 
jet into small droplets, droplet collision, and coalescence, evaporation, 
turbulent mixing or micromixing, spray impingement, etc. as shown in 
Fig.  3.  The  mechanisms  of  spray  breakup  are  important  because  the 
breakup processes determine the spray structure, initial droplet size, and 
distribution, and they control the initial conditions for vaporization and 
subsequent  processes.  In  addition,  aerodynamic,  turbulence,  and 
cavitation-induced  breakup  can  affect  the  breakup  process  in  diesel 
sprays.  However,  understanding  the  spray  formation  process  using 
either both computational or experimental methodologies is challenging 
because of the multi-scale, multi-dimensional, and multi-physics nature 
of  the  problem.  Currently,  numerical  research  on  the  liquid  fuel  jet 

atomization process can be classified into two principal categories [17, 
18]: (1) using a Eulerian approach to simulate primary breakup in the 
dense  spray  regime  region  and  (2)  using  a  Lagrangian  approach  to 
simulate turbulence–combustion–droplet interaction in the dilute spray 
region.  However,  to  systematically  investigate  fuel  spray  atomization 
and combustion of liquid fuel in entire spray region cannot be achieved 
by either approach. Therefore, many researchers have studied the liquid 
jet  process  using  multi-scale  methods  combining  Eulerian  and 
Lagrangian methods. Recently, Luo et al. [19] reviewed the application 
of the level set method in the study of the spray atomization process, 
including the primary breakup and secondary atomization. 

Ignition or low-temperature reaction 

The ID time is the time interval between the start of the injection and 
the  appearance  of  high-temperature  reactions.  It  is  affected  by  both 
physical  and  chemical  delays  in  the  spray  flame  [15].  Liquid  fuel  in-
jection, atomization, evaporation, and mixing contribute to the physical 
effect. The formation of the key intermediate species and heat release 
from the early reactions cause the chemical effect. Many studies [24-26] 
have  been  devoted  to  understanding  the  mechanisms  of  multi-stage 
ignition based on fundamental chemical aspects. 

Three  modes  of  ignition  are  distinguished  based  on  the  relative 
timescales of evaporation, convection, and diffusion in the surrounding 
gas for liquid fuel combustion [27]: (1) individual droplet ignition, (2) 
group ignition around droplets, and (3) spray ignition or global ignition. 
Turbulent sprays exhibit a multistage and multimode ignition process. 
During the first-stage ignition (also known as the LTC stage), different 
products,  such  as  ketohydroperoxide  (KET)  and  CH2O  are  formed, 
leading to a slow increase in the gas temperature. Therefore, the mass 
formation of these species can be used to identify the first-stage ignition, 
which can cause a ‘softening’ effect of the characteristic refractive index 
gradients before the high-temperature ignition (HTI) event [28]. Once 
high-temperature reactions occur in spray flames, the schlieren images 
become dark again. During the second stage of ignition, CH2O is quickly 
consumed, and H2O2  rapidly decomposes to OH radicals, leading to a 
rapid increase in temperature. 

The second-stage ignition is expected to occur away from the stoi-
chiometry  and  at  the  most  reactive  mixture  fraction  location  [29]. 
Evaporation of droplets requires the absorption of heat from the envi-
ronment, causing a drop in the gas temperature. Thus, high-temperature 
reactions  must  occur  at  a  location  with  a  suitable  temperature  and 
equivalence ratio. The ignition location can also be influenced by the 
initial conditions, such as gas temperature, oxygen concentration, and

gas density [30]. For a highly reactive mixture, HTI tends to initialize at 
fuel-rich locations behind the spray tip with low mixture gradients [31]. 
At lower gas temperatures, the reactivity of the mixture is reduced. The 
already  formed  heat  and  intermediate  radicals  can  be  transported 
outside owing to the gradients. Therefore, the first ignition location is 
away from the spray tip. Overall, during the mutlistage ignition process 
of  spray  flames,  the  first-stage  ignition  dominates  because  the  heat 
release and key intermediate species formed during the stage determine 
the second-stage ignition [24,25]. 

Flame lift-off length (LOL) and flame stabilization process 

The LOL represents the most upstream location of the combustion 
region,  where  the  flame  is  stabilized  and  becomes  quasi-steady,  as 
depicted in  Fig. 2.  In experiments, the LOL can be measured by OH* 
chemiluminescence with a pre-selected percentage of the local peak, for 
example, 50% in one study [32]. The LOL influences the entrainment of 
fresh gas and eventually the formation of pollutant emissions, such as 
soot. The LOL itself is the result of the complex processes of fuel breakup, 
atomization, vaporization, mixing, and fresh air entrainment. Therefore, 
it is influenced by many parameters, such as ambient gas temperature, 
oxygen concentration, ambient density, turbulence, and injection pres-
sure  variation.  A  higher  mixture  reactivity,  for  example,  results  in  a 
shorter flame LOL, indicating that the interaction between the flame and 
the  fuel  droplets  as  well  as  the  evaporation  at  the  tip  of  injection,  is 
enhanced, which in turn causes faster combustion [5]. 

1.2. Motivation 

Recent reviews on the turbulent spray flame or two-phase flow can 
be  found  in  [1,8,33],  where  new  experimental  and  modeling  de-
velopments in spray combustion are summarized. For instance, Jenny 
et al. [1] outlined the main interactions among turbulence, spray, and 
combustion,  and  focused  their  review  on  spray  models  in  the  dilute 
spray regime. However, the physics phenomena process regarding spray 
breakup as well as atomization and spray-ambient gas interaction were 
not included. Jiang et al. [34] also focused on the physical models and 
numerical techniques for DNS and LES of gas–liquid two-phase jet flow 
atomization and spray processes in internal combustion engines and gas 
turbine combustors, but combustion mechanisms were not considered. 
Subsequently,  Masri  [33]  covered  both  dilute  and  dense  sprays, 
providing detailed discussions on current experimental and numerical 
capabilities  for  understanding  spray  flame  structures.  Moreover, 

S´anchez  et  al.  [2]  presented  the  progress  made  in  the  mathematical 
description of spray vaporization and spray flame for interacting mul-
tiscale processes and attempted to make use of the disparities between 
lengths and timescales in spray combustion. So far, there has been a lack 
of  a  comprehensive  review  focusing  on  the  three-way  turbulence–-
spray–combustion interactions under engine-like conditions. In partic-
ular,  discussion  has  been  limited  on  turbulent  spray  flames  in 
supercritical  environments  and  in  methane–air  mixtures,  which  are 
important  to  marine  diesel  engines  and  dual-fuel  engines.  Additional 
complexities, such as the presence of walls and radiation effects have not 
been given sufficient attention in previous review articles. As pointed 
out by S´anchez et al. [2], the understanding of the complex phenomena 
in turbulent spray combustion is far from complete. 

Within the above context, this review covers key and representative 
developments in the area of turbulent spray combustion in terms of the 
spray–chemistry–turbulence interactions under engine-like conditions, 
as  shown  in  Fig.  4.  Valuable  insights  into  the  turbulence–chemistry, 
spray–turbulence,  and  spray-chemistry  interactions  under  engine-like 
conditions are discussed. Furthermore, the spray–radiation interaction 
and spray flame-wall interaction (FWI), which usually occur in engines, 
are discussed. Finally, future research directions and further challenges 
involving supercritical spray flames, turbulent spray flames in dual fuel 
engines, and spray flames of real engine fuels are also discussed briefly.

2. Turbulent spray combustion 

Interacting  multiscale  processes  govern  spray  vaporization  and 
combustion processes downstream of the near-injector atomization re-
gion in combustors [2]. The liquid fuel must be broken up into small 
droplets and exposed to hot ambient gas, promoting rapid evaporation 
and mixing. Hence, the combustion characteristics are dominated by the 
spray and mixing processes owing to their larger timescales. In turn, the 
combustion of fuel vapor also exerts a significant influence on the at-
omization and mixing processes. The dynamics of spray and combustion 
determine the flame stability, efficient utilization of fuel, and formation 
and decomposition of pollutant emissions [34]. Therefore, to develop 
advanced combustion strategies, efforts should be made to understand 
the interacting processes in turbulent spray combustion. Because liquid 
fuel is injected into a high-temperature and high-pressure environment, 
liquid droplets are formed, broken up, dispersed, collided, heated, and 
evaporated. The spray process with a high injection pressure promotes 
the  spray–turbulence  interaction.  If  the  environment  temperature  is 
sufficiently high for the formation of a spray flame, turbulence–chem-
istry interaction will occur. In addition, because of the competing effects 
of cooling due to spray evaporation and flame propagation toward the 
injector,  stable  quasi-steady  combustion  may  be  established.  The 
multi-injection strategy is a very effective way for reducing particulate 
emissions  without  a  large  increase  in  NOx  emissions  [36,37].  Such  a

2.1. Turbulence-chemistry interaction 

The  turbulence–chemistry  interaction  poses  a  great  challenge  in 
understanding the complex engine processes because such an interac-
tion  occurs  over  a  wide  range  of  time  and  length  scales.  In  general, 
turbulence enhances the macromixing and micromixing of reactants as 
well as the chemical reactions, leading to changes in the temperature 
and gas density, and affect the flow itself. Moreover, both turbulence 
and combustion are strongly nonlinear phenomena, where small fluc-
tuations  in  conditions  can  trigger  remarkable  changes  in  combustion 
behaviors such as flame instability and quenching. Under diesel engine- 
like  conditions,  especially  the  relevant  conditions  for  advanced  com-
bustion engines, unresolved small fluctuations in the turbulent flow or 
thermochemical state can affect the prediction of the combustion pro-
cess [38]. The interaction between turbulence and chemistry is expected 
to  dominate  the  ignition  process  [9],  flame  configuration  with  both 
temperature  and  composition 
inhomogeneity  [39,40],  chemical 
pathway through a series of elementary reactions [41,42] and formation 
of emissions [11], as illustrated in Fig. 5, which will be discussed later in 
detail. 

2.1.1. Effect of turbulence on combustion 

Turbulence  affects  the  combustion  process  both  directly  and 

indirectly. Combustion depends on the mixing process between the fuel 
and  oxygen  at  the  molecular  level.  The  eddy  breakup  forms  smaller 
eddies, increasing strain and shear and therefore, steepening the con-
centration gradients of reactants, which in turn strengthens their mo-
lecular interdiffusion [43]. Turbulence can also wrinkle and increase the 
flame  surface  and  hence  increase  the  global  burning  rate.  Moreover, 
turbulence-enhanced  heat  losses  can  result  in  local  flame  quenching, 
and in the worst case, a premixed flame cannot survive under certain 
strong  turbulence  conditions  [44].  Turbulence  can  induce  a  higher 
effective  diffusion  rate, 
leading  to  a  thickened  flame  brush. 
Micro-mixing  also  depends  on  the  local  turbulent  length  scales.  In  a 
premixed flame, if the flame thickness (δL) is smaller than the minimum 
turbulence length scale (the Kolmogorov length scale, lη), i.e., δL < lη, the 
entire reactive diffusive flame structure is embedded within the smallest 
eddies of the Kolmogorov scale, where the flow is quasi-laminar [43]. 
Turbulent fluctuations cannot perturb the flame; thus, its structure re-
tains that of a laminar flamelet. When lη<δL, the flame thickness is larger 
than the  Kolmogorov  length  scale  such  that the  smallest  scale  of  tur-
bulence can stir the flame structure. Turbulent mixing at the smallest 
length scales is sufficiently energetic to disrupt the internal structure of 
the reaction zone [44]. This can only be true when the turbulence in-
tensity is sufficiently high. Thus, a classical combustion regime diagram 
involving the laminar flame zone, thin reaction zone, corrugated reac-
tion zone, wrinkled flamelets zone and broken reaction zone in terms of 
Da  number  and  Karlovitz  number  (Ka)  was  proposed  by  Peters  [43], 
which can describe the timescales of the flame–turbulence interaction. 
Turbulence with a fast timescale can homogenize the fuel–air mixture 
such that ignition is more prone to occur as spontaneous ignition [39]. 
However, fast mixing occurs only over a length scale smaller than the 
most energetic length scale of the temperature fluctuation. A high tur-
bulence intensity results in the dissipation of heat and radicals during 
the  first-stage  ignition  process,  thereby  retarding  the  ignition  process 
[40]. 

The  effect  of  turbulence  on  combustion  differs  significantly  for 
different  fuels.  The  combustion  process  of  different  fuels,  including 
hydrogen, methane, and dodecane, was studied by varying the Karlovitz 
number (Ka), which is known as the ratio of the Kolmogorov timescale 
to the chemical timescale [45,46]. A thickening factor was introduced to 
quantify the widening of the preheat zone in turbulent flames. The re-
sults  showed  an  increase in  the  thickening  factor  for  methane with  a 
global Lewis number of unity, especially at low temperatures. For tem-
peratures below approximately 760 K, the flame is at least 50% thicker, 
and the thickening factor increases up to 2.5 at a lower temperature. 
Even at a temperature of approximately 1220 K, some thickening can 
still be observed. For the premixed dodecane flame, the thickening effect 
of turbulence becomes more obvious at high Ka numbers. However, for a 
lean  hydrogen  flame  with  the  global  Lewis  number  of  around  0.35, 
turbulence interacts with the premixed flame, creating regions of high 
positive curvature that can enhance the burning process. Compared to 
methane,  fuel  decomposition  pyrolysis  and  oxidation  occur  in  a  rela-
tively cooler region. Although the basic oxidation pathways of species

are largely unaffected by turbulent mixing, a large difference in species 
distribution in the temperature space is observed between laminar and 
turbulent flames. 

Turbulence  can  disturb  the  chemical  pathway  through  a  series  of 
elementary reactions. Compared to those of a laminar flame, the tem-
perature,  species  distribution,  and  heat  release  distribution  can  be 
considerably different in turbulent combustion, which directly affect the 
chemical pathway. The turbulent stirring process of small-scale eddies 
introduces spatially differentiated convective transport of species, thus 
altering  the  contributions  of  different  reactions.  At  a  low  turbulence 
intensity or in a laminar flame, the transport of H radicals controlled by 
molecular  diffusion is  much slower than the local chemical timescale 
[47].  Owing  to  turbulent  convection,  the  effective  diffusion  time  is 
significantly shortened at a high turbulence level, which can be com-
parable to the local chemical timescale. The rapid transport of H radicals 
from  regions  of  their  formation  enhances  their  concentration  in  the 
low-temperature region, thus significantly increasing the reaction rates 
of exothermic chain-terminating reactions, for example, H + O2 + M → 
HO2 + M. Therefore, the low-temperature regions may exhibit enhanced 
heat release. A further study [48] showed that the locations with strong 
heat release appear at places away from regions of high fuel consump-
tion through three reactions: HO2 + M →  HO2 + M, HO2 + H → OH +
OH, and HO2 + OH → H2O + O2. No fuel molecule (H2) is included in 
these reactions, which are responsible for much of the heat released at 
locations of negative curvature. Further studies to understand the global 
influence of turbulence on chemical pathways [41,42] found that the 
contributions of several critical reactions to heat release can be influ-
enced by turbulence. The contribution of the dominant exothermic re-
action  H  + O2  + M  →  HO2  + M  to  the  heat  release  rate  changes  by 
approximately 20%, and the importance of H + OH + M → H2O + M 
reaction nearly doubles, which are a substantial effects. 

Currently,  the  effects  of  turbulence  are  mostly  studied  in  simple 
configurations, which neglects the high-speed injection process. In high- 
speed  injection,  the  induced  turbulence  is  greater  than  that  in  the 
ambient gas, and it is difficult to quantitatively study the effect of small- 
scale turbulence on combustion. Previous studies [49,50] investigated 
the effects of macro-gas flow such as swirl flow on the spray flame. The 
swirl flow shortened the spray penetration and flame lengths. In addi-
tion,  for  the  reacting  case,  strong  liquid-gas  interactions  due  to  the 
anti-swirl flow could cause the local unburnt phenomenon. 

2.1.2. Effect of combustion on turbulence 

The  combustion  of  fuel  enhances  the  compositional  gradients  and 
alters the micromixing (or molecular mixing), which in turn has a sig-
nificant influence on the reactions. Chemical reactions consume the fuel 
and oxidizer at the interface and steepen the scalar gradients in non-
premixed flames, thus enhancing the micromixing. The velocity statis-
tics of turbulent flow are modified owing to the heat release and  gas 
expansion  [43,51].  The  chemical  heat  release  increases  the  gas  tem-
perature and thus the fluid viscosity, consequently dampening the tur-
bulence.  Experimental  results  reveal  that  combustion  can  modify 
turbulent flows and lead to the suppression of turbulence [52]. 

However, combustion can also generate turbulence, known as flame- 
generated turbulence, which plays a crucial role in the prediction of heat 
transfer, heat release, pollutant emissions, and instability in combustion 
devices  [53,54].  Flame-generated  turbulence  strongly depends  on the 
level of heat release. A higher heat release results in a stronger flame 
turbulence effect [55]. Combustion also increases the turbulent kinetic 
energy (TKE) because of the mean and fluctuating pressure terms [55], 
turbulent shear stresses, buoyancy, and interaction of density fluctua-
tions with a small, self-induced pressure gradient [56]. Observations in 
experiments of freely propagating premixed flames reveal an increase in 
turbulence  intensities  across  a  flame,  especially  for  the  component 
normal to the flame brush, resulting in anisotropic turbulence after the 
flame passes [56]. Combustion can modify the turbulence intensity from 
different aspects. It can lead to a decrease in intensity due to dilatation 

and increased dissipation rates, which results from a rapid increase in 
viscosity. The fundamental properties of turbulence can also be influ-
enced  by  combustion.  The  increased  dissipation  dampens  small-scale 
eddies, resulting in a lower frequency content and larger length scale. 
Volumetric expansion also increases the length scale [56]. In a direct 
numerical simulation (DNS) study of combustion effect on turbulence in 
a supersonic diffusion flame, the Reynolds stress budget was analyzed in 
detail [54]. It was found that, compared with the inert case, increasing 
the heat release leads to an intensification of the pressure–strain term in 
the reacting flow, which changes the flow anisotropy and the Reynolds 
stress components [54]. Moreover, the TKE budget via the pressure–-
strain contributes to combustion-generated turbulence. 

As  for  the  effect  of  combustion  on  turbulence  in  a  spray  flame, 
combustion-induced  dilatation  was  also  found  to  change  the  velocity 
component  at  the  downstream  position  in  spray  flames,  where  a 
counter-clockwise vortex exists at the downstream position [57,58]. The 
dilatation magnifies this vortex and even reverses the flow back towards 
the nozzle. The velocity component toward the nozzle can accelerate the 
transport of hot products upstream, which further influences the spray 
evaporation.  A similar  vortex structure was  observed  in  the schlieren 
image [59]. In addition, in [60], by studying the interaction between 
local flow and flame structures, combustion could result in a 50–60% 
increase in local axial velocity owing to the density drop. Concurrent 
with the flow acceleration, the mixture transition from inert to reacting 
conditions  led  to  radial  expansion.  Moreover,  compared  to  the  inert 
case, the simulation results showed that the entrainment of fresh air was 
reduced by approximately 25% for the reacting case, and the first drop 
in the entrainment rate appeared at the location of the flame LOL. The 
main  reason  is  that  combustion-induced  dilatation  reverses  the  flow 
back  to  the  nozzle,  and  the  negative  component  of  the  axial  velocity 
counteracts entrainment [60]. 

2.1.3. Prediction of spray flames based on TCI 

Owing  to  the  complex  process  of  turbulent  spray  combustion, 
quantitative parameter studies using DNS [39,40] are difficult to carry 
out in complex spray flames. An effective method for analyzing the ef-
fect of turbulence on spray flames is to compare the ignition and flame 
characteristics  obtained  from  combustion  models  considering  the  TCI 
effect with that from the well-stirred reactor (WSR) model [9,61]. Un-
resolved turbulent fluctuations have been shown to affect the prediction 
accuracy  of  combustion  and  emissions  of  spray  flames.  In  order  to 
accurately  predict  turbulent  spray  flames,  the  TCI  effects  should  be 
considered  properly.  Advanced  combustion  models  that  consider  TCI 
effects show better accuracy in predicting the ID, flame LOL, distribu-
tions of temperature and intermediate products, such as CH2O, H2O2, 
and soot precursor. 

Neglecting  the  TCI  effect  may  overpredict  the  local  temperature 
distribution [62,63]. With respect to the autoignition process, simula-
tion  results  from  those  models  considering  TCI  effects  show  better 
agreement with experiments, especially under low temperatures and/or 
low oxygen concentrations [9-11]. For example, for the case at a low 
initial  gas  temperature  of  750  K,  the  WSR  model  fails  to  predict  the 
ignition process, while the transport probability density function (PDF) 
model  shows  a  reasonable  agreement  with  experiments  [11].  It  was 
found  that  at  higher  temperatures,  turbulent  fluctuations  play  a  less 
important  role  in  global  ignition  behaviors  than  at  low  temperatures 
because  the  range  of  air/fuel  ratio  becomes  wider  and  reactions  can 
occur  over  a  wider  region  in  the  mixture  fraction  space  [11,61].  As 
pointed  out  by  Bhattacharjee  and  co-authors  [9],  detailed 
low-temperature  chemistry  at  low  reactivity  conditions  is  required  to 
sufficiently capture the autoignition process. In this case, the TCI effect 
becomes more pronounced by comparing the computed IDs and flame 
LOLs from the  WSR  and PDF  methods  at low-  and  high-temperatures 
conditions for both n-heptane and n-dodecane. As exhibited in Fig. 6, 
the difference in the ID introduced by considering TCI is 0.95 ms at fign 
for Tamb = 850 K, compared to 0.27 ms for Tamb = 1000 K, which 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience86(2021)1009396L. Zhou et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

and WSR methods can obtain similar diffusion flame structures. How-
ever, compared to the WSR method, the PDF method can resolve many 
more thermochemical state points, which indicates more inert mixing 
and consequently a substantial effect on emissions predictions. It should 
be noted that the “rich-premixed core” and “outer diffusion flame” labels 
in  Fig.  7  indicate  the  characteristics  of  standard  quasi-steady  spray 
combustion. 

Some other studies [10,64] have focused on soot formation in tur-
bulent spray flames considering the impact TCI. Soot formation is ex-
pected to be strongly dependent on air entrainment into the turbulent 
spray [65]. The current state of soot modeling is immature. TCI effects 
are expected to increase the soot oxidation rate, leading to considerably 
lower soot mass. In addition, TCI effects result in narrower soot distri-
butions,  and  soot  onset  and  peak  are  located  at  further  downstream 
locations when the TCI is not considered [64]. As displayed in Fig. 8, the 
predicted  flame  structures  show  large  differences  between  the  WSR 
model and the transport PDF model in terms of the soot peak values and 
locations. Without considering the TCI, the WSR model overestimates 
the formation of soot and both the soot peak locations and flame heads 
move further downstream. Moreover, the WSR model overpredicts the 
flame  LOL.  Micromixing  is  completely  ignored  by  the  WSR  model, 
leading to a significant difference in the flame LOL. The macromixing 
prediction is also indirectly influenced by different combustion models. 
Large-scale  gradients  affecting  macromixing  are  much  lower  in  the 
transport  PDF  model  than  in  the  WSR  model  [64].  However,  Mohan 
et al. [38] found the opposite conclusion in modeling soot production in 
a heavy diesel engine. They found that the PDF model considering the 
TCI effect resulted in more soot, which is closer to the experimental data 
than that from the WSR model. The main reason for this is that a wider 
range of thermochemical states is obtained by the PDF model, which is 
beneficial to soot prediction. It should also be noted that soot formation 
is a complicated process that is affected by both physical and chemical 
factors. Therefore, the effect of TCI under a wide range of conditions 
should be further studied to isolate its effect. 

It is also noted that turbulent models in LES and RANS also influence 
the ignition and combustion. LES can obtain the transient spray flame 
structure involving the distributions of the mixture fraction, tempera-
ture, OH, and soot mass fraction, as well as accurate combustion char-
acteristics of the ID and flame LOL at different initial temperatures [58]. 
More importantly, LES captures the multiple ignition spots in the mixing 
layer; in contrast, the RANS method can capture only one ignition spot. 

2.1.4. Chemistry mechanism impact 

In spray flame simulations, two essential aspects should be consid-
ered, i.e., the selection of the chemical kinetic mechanism and the TCI 
effect. As discussed above, the spray flame characteristics can be accu-
rately captured by considering TCI based on the selection of an accurate 
chemical  mechanism  [66,67].  More  sophisticated  chemical  kinetic 
models with a very large number of species and radical reactions have 
been proposed for the main fuels of engines [68]. However, the appli-
cation of detailed chemical kinetics in combustion simulations is very 
limited, and the major challenge is the computation-intensive nature of 
chemical kinetics integration for a large number of chemical species and 
reactions over a wide range of chemical timescales involved. Therefore, 
a skeletal mechanism consisting of a selected subset of species and re-
actions derived from the detailed mechanism is usually applied to model 
the combustion process within certain accuracy, over a wide range (e.g., 
comparable  to  that  of  the  detailed  mechanism)  of  conditions,  i.e., 
different  pressures,  temperatures,  oxygen  concentrations,  and  equiva-
lence  ratios.  Over  the  past  decade,  great  efforts  have  been  made  to 
develop  sufficiently  accurate  skeletal  or  reduced  mechanisms  for 
n-heptane [69], iso-octane [70], and primary reference fuel [71] using 
different methods [68]. The reduced mechanisms were developed based 
on simple configurations to cover engine-like temperature, pressure and 
mixture concentration conditions. Thus, the application of these mech-
anisms should first be validated in spray flames. For instance, Frassoldati 

Fig. 6. The ignition delay as a function of the mixture fraction based on the TCI 
effect under n-heptane spray flame conditions at low and high initial temper-
atures of 850 K and 1000 K, respectively [61]. 

indicates that TCI has a substantial effect at a low initial temperature of 
850 K [61]. Shortly after the appearance of high-temperature kernels, 
spray flames reach the quasi-steady state, where the high-temperature 
region cannot move upstream and stabilize at a place. The inclusion of 
TCI effects by employing the transport PDF approach with two reduced 
mechanisms plays a much more important role in predicting the LOL 
than  in  modeling  the  ID  [11,64].  The  LOL  strongly  reflects  the 
quasi-steady state of a spray flame, which is also dependent on the fuel 
injection  process  and  is  relevant  to  the  spray–combustion  interaction 
discussed later. 

Furthermore, the TCI effect also plays a critical role in the distribu-
tions of the mixture concentration, temperature, and intermediate spe-
cies,  such  as  OH.  Previous  studies  [9,38,62,63]  have  shown  that 
neglecting the TCI may lead to an overestimated heat release rate, which 
results in a higher local temperature and OH concentration. A broader 
turbulent flame brush was found when the TCI effects were considered 
[9,63]. From the ϕ(cid:0) T maps in Fig. 7, it can be seen that both the PDF

et al. [72] developed a reduced mechanism for n-dodecane, including 96 
species and 993 reactions, from a detailed chemistry mechanism con-
sisting of more than 450 species and 15,000 reactions [73]. The pro-
posed reduced mechanism obtained a well qualitative agreement with 
the  experimental  data  by  comparing  the  IDs,  species  concentration 
profiles from flow reactors and JSRs, and laminar flame speeds over a 
wide range of conditions. It was concluded that the difference of pre-
dictive capabilities were significantly affected by the low-temperature 
reactions including the early period for which the cool flame extends 
[66].  Therefore,  a  widely  used  kinetic  mechanism  should  be  able  to 
accurately predict the first-stage ignition process (cool flame), especially 
under  low-temperature  and/or  low  oxygen  concentration  conditions, 
which are typical for LTC strategies. 

Furthermore,  the  simulation  accuracy  of  turbulent  spray  flames  is 
also  dependent  on  the  boundary  conditions  including  the  injection 
conditions, ambient temperature and pressure, fuel properties, and nu-
merical parameters [58,74]. Related to this, uncertainty quantification 
analysis can be conducted to provide insights into the effect of boundary 
conditions on the spray flame characteristics. A global sensitivity anal-
ysis to understand the effect of boundary conditions on 17 variables was 
carried out by  Pei et  al. [74].  They found that the liquid  penetration 
length is significantly affected by the uncertainty in the fuel tempera-
ture, whereas the vapor penetration length is very sensitive to the initial 
turbulence  intensity  and  nozzle  diameter.  Furthermore,  the  ambient 
temperature has a strong effect on the ID and flame LOL at both a low 
temperature of 800 K and a high temperature of 1100 K, but its strong 
effect on soot emissions only happens at 800 K. Moreover, the nozzle 
diameter significantly influences the soot mass. A study of the influence 
of injection-to-injection variation with multiple realizations on the tur-
bulent spray flame using the LES method was conducted [58]. Using the 
relevance index analysis, it was suggested that at least 5–6 realizations 
are required to capture a similar mixture fraction and temperature of 
approximately 99% compared to 16 realizations. However, the soot and 
OH mass fractions require more realizations of 8 and 14, respectively, 
because of the high fluctuations. 

In  summary,  the  validations  of  turbulent  combustion  models, 
chemical  mechanisms  and  spray  models  should  be  coupled  in  a  real 
spray flame. Many studies have demonstrated that consideration of the 
TCI provides a better prediction over the WSR model in terms of flame 
LOL and ID [10,64,75]. The WSR model without considering the TCI can 
overpredict  the  ID,  especially  at  low  ambient  temperatures  and  low 
oxygen concentrations [9,76]. A thin flame structure with a consider-
ably high local peak temperature and heat release rate was also observed 
when the TCI impact was not considered. Moreover, the TCI can also 

cause less soot emission but higher NO formation [77]. To accurately 
evaluate  the  TCI  effect  in  turbulent  spray  flames,  the  spray  models, 
boundary  conditions,  and  chemical  reaction  mechanisms  should  be 
carefully considered first. In most studies, turbulence is induced by the 
spray process; however, the effect of ambient turbulent flow on com-
bustion in turbulent spray flames under diesel engine-like conditions has 
not been well established. Furthermore, researchers have started to use 
LES with subgrid-scale models to consider small-scale fluctuations while 
resolving large-scale turbulent fluctuations [78,79]. Such studies help to 
clarify the TCI effects at different scales and should be extended to more 
realistic conditions. 

2.2. Spray–turbulence interaction 

The spray–turbulence interaction that occurs immediately after in-
jection  is  important  for  the  subsequent  ignition  and  combustion  pro-
cesses. In this section, the effects of turbulence on droplet motion and 
liquid  injection  as  well  as  the  effects  of  spray  on  turbulent  flow  are 
discussed. 

2.2.1. Effect of spray on turbulence 

In  combustion  engines,  cold  fuel  is  directly  injected  into  a  high- 
temperature and high-pressure environment with a large initial veloc-
ity, forming a dense spray near the injector nozzle. The injection pres-
sure provides a high spray momentum, thus promoting turbulence [80]. 
The  momentum  exchange  between  the  ambient  hot  gas  and  the  cold 
dense spray produces droplets and then vapor with strong kinetic energy 
to  move  downstream.  The  high-velocity  gradients  between  the  dro-
plets/vapor and the ambient gas promote the generation of shear layers, 
entrainment  vortices,  and  turbulence,  which  in  turn  improve  mixing 
between  the  fuel  vapor  and  air  [81],  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  9.  The 
entrainment of hot gas accelerates the evaporation of droplets, leading 
to large gradients in the local temperature and mixture concentration. 
The liquid phase can only exist in a small region close to the injector 
nozzle. Further downstream, it breaks up into small droplets, which then 
vaporize and mix with hot gas, forming an ignitable mixture. 

The  length  of  the  liquid  phase,  known  as  the  liquid  penetration 
length, is less dependent on the initial gas temperature [80]. Injection 
pressure and ambient density play important roles. An increase in gas 
density  leads  to  shorter  liquid  penetrations  and  faster  breakup  and 
mixing  rates  by  (1)  changing  the  droplet  breakup  rates  and  (2) 
increasing hot air entering the liquid spray [82]. However, the effect of 
turbulent fluctuations is negligible, as reported in [11]. The vapor phase 
shows  strong  instability  and  cycle-to-cycle  variations  in  five  different 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience86(2021)1009398L. Zhou et al.

injection realizations [83]. As the vapor mixes with the hot ambient gas, 
the spray head becomes much wider and leaner. Meanwhile, attenuation 
in the spray axial velocity leads to slow movement of the vapor head. 
Simulation results also showed a rapid decrease in the scalar dissipation 
rate downstream of the spray, indicating that the flow timescale char-
acterized by the reciprocal of the scalar dissipation rate becomes much 
longer. 

Regarding the effect of spray on turbulence in multiple injections, it 
was found that the local turbulence intensity formed in the first injection 
is enhanced when the second injection moves into the first injection flow 
[84].  The effect of spray on turbulence also depends  on the injection 
parameters, such as the dwell time (DT) and injection duration in split 
injections.  The  DT  affects  the  interaction  between  the  injections,  the 
maximum penetration of the second injection, and the distribution of the 
TKE. The overlap region of two injections for the case with short DT has 
a high TKE, which can enhance mixing owing to the high local scalar 
dissipation [84]. However, the strong interaction limits the entrainment 
of the oxidizer ahead of the second injection, which is carried by the first 
injection toward the downstream locations. 

2.2.2. Effect of turbulence on spray 

Turbulent fluctuations in the fuel jet are the main sources of initial 
perturbations on the jet surface [85]. It is expected that the gas–phase 
turbulence  affects  the  breakup  process  in  the  spray,  but  an  in-depth 
understanding is lacking. Turbulent fluctuations induced by the liquid 
spray have a significant effect on liquid droplet evolution and consid-
ering the turbulent fluctuation effects in numerical simulations can lead 
to a more accurate prediction of liquid penetration and distribution of 
fuel vapor [86,87]. 

Turbulence effects on the breakup process. If a liquid is injected directly 
into the gas–phase ambient, the primary breakup length is expected to 
be strongly affected by the mean spray/gas velocity or gas–phase fluc-
tuations and the turbulence intensity. Gas-phase turbulence affects the 
spray  atomization  process,  which  was  first  examined  by  Kolmogorov 
[88].  The  results  show  that  for  gaseous  flows  with  high  Reynolds 

numbers, fragments of size DB  satisfy DB≫lη

vl
vg

where lη  is the Kol-

mogorov scale, and turbulent ‘resonant’ atomization can be exhibited. 
Any droplet larger than lη will exhibit turbulence-assisted atomization. If 
the relative velocity between the ambient gas and the liquid jet is suf-
ficiently high, the liquid jet surface will show significant instabilities. An 
increase in the Reynolds number of the liquid jet can cause turbulent

breakup [89]. For the effect of turbulence in droplet dispersion, it was 
shown  that  larger  drop  sizes  have  larger  fluctuations  of  droplet  con-
centration (≈50% of the respective mean) compared to smaller droplets. 
The random turbulence has a more important effect on the fluctuations 
in  the  droplet  concentration  of  larger  droplets  because  of  the  similar 
timescale  of  droplet  response  compared  to  the  Kolmogorov  timescale 
[90].  However,  the  more  uniform  distribution  of  small  droplets  was 
mainly controlled by the convective fluid motion. 

Gas-phase fluctuations have a significant influence on the primary 
breakup morphology, and the deformation of droplets exhibits a clear 
dependence  on  the  turbulent  Weber  number  [89].  The  occurrence  of 
gas-phase  velocity  fluctuations  is  likely  to  randomize  the  break-up 
process.  The  concept  of  a  turbulent  Weber  number  was  proposed  by 
Kolmogorov and expanded by Hinze [91], as follows:

where  u2
d  represents  the  mean  square  of  the  velocity  fluctuations  be-
tween  two  points  located  at  diametrically  opposite  positions  on  the 
surface  of  the  droplet.  ρg  is  the  gas  density,  d  indicates  the  droplet 
diameter, and σ is the coefficient of surface tension. To characterize the 
droplet  shapes  by  considering  the  effect  of  gas-phase  fluctuations, 
Kourmatzis and Masri [89] defined the turbulent Weber number We

Based on the defined turbulent Weber number, they found that the 
aspect ratio of the droplet has a linear relationship with the turbulent 
Weber number and turbulent fluctuations can delay the evolution from 
deformed to more spherical droplets. 

In  the  Lagrangian  method,  the  effect  of  turbulence  on  the  droplet 
motion is exerted by momentum exchange. In the high-velocity region, 
the spray-induced subgrid kinetic energy and droplet turbulent disper-
sion can significantly alter the position and motion of the droplet [86, 
87]. The Lagrangian operation for keeping track of the motion of these 
parcels is a series of ordinary differential equations, which govern the 
mass, momentum, and energy exchanges between the liquid spray and 
the gas. In the droplet Lagrangian equations, the drag force Fi,d of the gas 
phase on a liquid drop is modeled as:

To further understand the effect of turbulence dispersion velocity on 
the  spray  process,  Hindi  et  al.  [92]  conducted  an  LES  study  for  a 
non-reacting n-dodecane spray with a stochastic turbulence dispersion 
model. A new criterion for determining mesh refinement was proposed 
based on the droplet Stokes number, which is defined as the ratio of the 
droplet  response  time  to  the  turbulent  eddy  timescale.  The  adopted 
mesh  should  be  sufficiently  refined,  and  no  turbulent  dispersion 
modeling is required if the droplet Stokes number is above unity. The 
subgrid turbulence does not influence the droplets because the influence 
of  turbulent  dispersion  on  the  droplets  is  already  considered  by  the 
resolved scales. 

Turbulence  effects  on  atomization  and  evaporation. The  turbulence 
formed inside the nozzle enhances the primary breakup and leads to a 
decrease in the droplet size and liquid penetration, and an increase in 
the radial dispersion of the spray [85,93]. Huh and Gosman [94] pro-
posed a phenomenological model that considers the effects of turbulent 
fluctuations in the jet on the breakup process. Later, Bianchi et al. [95] 
added  the  effects  of  turbulence  to  the  Kelvin-Helmholtz  (KH)  model. 
They  calculated  the  mean  droplet  size  and  production  rate  from  the 
estimated  mean  turbulence  properties  of  the  nozzle  flow.  Then,  Berg 
et  al.  [93]  extended  this  idea  by  employing  local  nozzle  flow  and 
additional TKE from the cavitation bubble collapses to compute the local 
distribution  of  breakup  rates  in  the  orifice  cross-section.  As  a  result, 
based on the above studies, Som and Aggarwal [85] developed a new 
primary breakup model (KH-ACT), which considers the effects of aero-
dynamic,  cavitation,  and  turbulence.  The  results  showed  that  the 
improved  model  can  obtain  good  agreement  with  the  X-ray  experi-
mental  data  for  the  liquid  penetration  length,  spray  cone  angle,  and 
liquid mass distribution, as well as the flame LOL and flame structure 
under a wide range of diesel engine conditions. 

In internal combustion engines, entrainment is extremely important 
because  enhanced  entrainment  helps  promote  soot  oxidation,  but 
overmixing  leads  to  deteriorative  unburned  hydrocarbons  (UHC)  for 
LTC strategies [96]. Large-scale motions in turbulent jet engulf volumes 
of  fluid  in  bulk,  thus,  promoting  the  entrainment  of  large  packets  of 
exterior  fluid  into  the  turbulent  region  [97].  Hence,  the  entrainment 
may  be  dominated  by  manipulating  the  boundary  conditions.  This 
conclusion  can be confirmed by comparing  the turbulent spray  struc-
tures under different initial conditions, namely, gas temperature, oxygen 
concentration, and gas density [98]. A higher initial gas temperature, 

oxygen concentration, or gas density results in a thinner flame structure, 
inhibiting the contact area between the fuel droplet and the surrounding 
fresh  gas.  Hence,  entrainment  is  very  limited,  leading  to  higher  soot 
emissions [99]. Other researchers have argued that small-scale turbulent 
mixing  at  the  highly  sheared  jet  interface dominates  the  entrainment 
process [100]. Because of large-scale eddies, the ambient non-turbulent 
fluid can be ‘induced’ and ‘engulfed’  into the turbulent core, which is 
converted into turbulent motion by the action of small-scale eddies via 
‘nibbling’. The spray tip region, regarded as the capturing section pro-
vides more than 80% of the total gas mass flow [101]. High injection 
pressure enhances the TKE at the exit plane, promoting fuel atomization 
and mixing. However, only an ultrahigh injection pressure, such as 300 
MPa, can enhance the mixing process; injection pressure ranging from 
50 to 150 MPa has a weak influence on the liquid penetration and even 
the IDs [4,102]. 

2.2.3. Momentum exchange between gas and liquid 

In  two-phase  flow  calculations,  there  are  two  methodologies  for 
simulating liquid- and gas-phase flows, namely (1) the Eulerian method, 
where both liquid and gas phases are treated as continuum fluids in the 
entire flow domain, and (2) the Lagrangian method, where the liquid 
phase  treated  as  by  clusters  of  droplets  is  tracked  in  the  entire  flow 
domain. When the Eulerian method is applied to treat a liquid phase, a 
liquid–gas flow structure with high fidelity can be obtained. However, 
this method is computationally expensive [21], and it can only be used 
for the near-nozzle region. The Lagrangian-Drop-Eulerian-Fluid (LDEF) 
method was then proposed and has been widely applied for gas–liquid 
flows  [103]  owing  to  its  low  cost.  In  this  method,  the  liquid  fuel  is 
considered as a sequence of discrete particles tracked by the Lagrangian 
particle tracking method, and the ambient fluid (gas) is considered as a 
continuum fluid solved by the Eulerian method. The two-phase inter-
action is treated by introducing spray source terms into gas-phase con-
servation equations. 

Although  the  Lagrangian  particle  tracking  method  can  efficiently 
obtain the droplet motion trajectory, this method also has strong grid 
dependence  [104,105].  A  previous  study  reported  that  this  method 
cannot accurately capture the spray–turbulence interaction and causes 
incorrect momentum coupling between the gas and liquid phases, which 
consequently  results  in  resolution-dependent  results  when  the  spatial 
distribution  of  droplets  is  highly  nonuniform  [106].  Araham  [107] 
examined  the  grid  dependency  of  spray  models  for  vaporizing  diesel 
sprays  in  a  constant-volume  chamber  and  showed  that  to  accurately 
predict  the  spray  structure,  the  nozzle  region  must  be  adequately 
resolved.  Further  studies  demonstrated  that  the  relative  velocity  be-
tween the liquid and gas phases is mesh-dependent and thus may cause a 
lower axial velocity, liquid and vapor penetration lengths for a vapor-
izing diesel spray when employing the LDEF method [105,108]. 

Several  studies  have  been  conducted  to  address  the  above  issue. 
Based on the momentum exchange between the gas flow and droplets, 
Abani et al. [109] and Beard et al. [105,108] proposed improved spray

models, which can obtain an accurate gas flow velocity induced by the 
spray process and consequently reduce grid dependency, as depicted in 
Fig. 10. In the new spray model, the spray flow has two components: the 
group  of  droplets,  which  comprises  the  liquid  phase,  and  the  air 
entrained, which represents the gas phase. For the gas jet theory, the 
improved spray model is briefly reviewed in the present work. In the 
equation for the magnitude of the relative velocity as shown above, ̃ui is 
given as ̃ui = (̃ux,̃uy,̃uz), where ̃ux and ̃uy are respectively the x-direction 
and  y-direction  perpendicular  components  of  the  ambient  gas-phase 
velocity solved by the original computational solution, while ̃uz  is the 
z-direction component derived from the entrained gas velocity model. 
The velocity ̃ui is used to calculate the magnitude of the relative velocity 
between  the  liquid  droplet  and  gas  Vrel.  At  present,  two  equations 
including steady equation and unsteady equation are used to calculate 
the entrained gas velocity. 

For the entrained gas velocity model according to the gas jet theory 
the  velocity,  ̃uz  is  given  by  the  Steady  Equation  Model  [110]  or  the 
Unsteady  Equation  Model  [111].  The  Steady  Equation  Model  is 
expressed as:

where Uinj is the injection velocity of the liquid jet, which is assumed to 
be the injection velocity of the gas jet; z stands for the axial distance 
between the droplet parcel and the nozzle; and r represents the radial 
distance of the droplet parcel from the spray axis. Based on this defini-
tion, the relative velocity between the ambient gas and fuel droplets in 
the near-nozzle region is assumed to be approximately zero. deq  repre-
sents the equivalent diameter, which is defined as deq  = dnoz

dnoz stands for the effective nozzle diameter, and ρl and ρg are the den-
sities of the liquid and gas phases, respectively. υt  denotes the turbulent 
viscosity of the jets and is calculated as υt = Ctπ0.5Uinjdeq/2, where Ct is 
the entrainment constant, which is set to 0.00161.

Lee and Reitz further improved the spray model based on the gas jet 
theory and carefully studied the spray tip penetration of diesel sprays 
over  a  wide  range  of  ambient  gas  density  conditions  [112,113].  The 
results demonstrated that the new spray model can efficiently obtain the 
relative velocity of the droplets and gas based on accurate momentum 
exchange and entrainment rate predictions. Consequently, mesh inde-
pendency  over  grid  sizes  with  a  maximum  disparity  of  16  times  per-
formed  very  well  in  terms  of  spray  characteristics  such  as  spray  tip 
penetration, droplet size, and spray structure, as illustrated in Fig. 11. 
To summarize, this section discusses recent progress in the under-
standing  and  modelling  of  the  spray–turbulence  interaction.  The 

mechanisms  of  spray  effects  on  the  turbulence  as  well  as  turbulence 
effects  on  the  spray  are  discussed.  The  spray  effect  on  turbulence 
strongly depends on the injection parameters. Actually, the core issue of 
the spray–turbulence interaction is the momentum exchange between 
the  ambient  hot  gas  and  cold  dense  spray,  which  enables  the  initial 
mixing process and subsequently determines the ignition and combus-
tion  processes.  The  gas  jet  theory  [110,114]  thoroughly  explains  the 
importance  of  the  momentum  exchange  between  the  gas  flow  and 
droplets.  The  spray–turbulence  interaction  is  treated  by  introducing 
spray source terms to the gas-phase conservation equations to obtain an 
accurate gas flow velocity induced by the spray process, which reduces 
the  grid  dependency.  On  the  other  hand,  a  more  accurate  model 
considering spray–turbulence interaction is still required for very high 
injection pressures of more than 300 MPa. 

2.3. Spray–chemistry interaction 

The spray–chemistry interaction has obvious effects on the perfor-
mance, stability, and reliability of internal combustion engines and gas 
turbine engines [115]. The evaporating fuel droplets feed the flame, and 
heat transfer from the high-temperature regions enhances the evapora-
tion of fuel, thus, sustaining the fuel supply. Fuel evaporation occurs at 
small  scales,  and  subsequently,  the  evaporated  fuel  mixes  with  air  to 
form  a  combustible  mixture.  Large-scale  turbulence  promotes  macro-
mixing,  whereas  small-scale  turbulence  enhances  micromixing.  After 
mixing of the vapor fuel and air, ignition kernels appear at certain lo-
cations,  which  are  controlled  by  the  local  mixture  fraction  state,  the 
temperature  and  the  level  of  scalar  dissipation  rate  [31].  A  strong 
coupling between the spray and combustion significantly increases the 
complexity because it occurs over a wide range of scales. The relative 
importance  of  the  evaporation  timescales  versus  the  convective  and 
molecular  diffusion  timescales  in  the  surrounding  gas  determines  the 
ignition modes. The presence of liquid droplets also alters the combus-
tion  dynamics.  The  local  flow  conditions,  droplet  distribution,  scalar 
gradients, and mixture fraction distributions may determine the flame 
regimes [116]. It can be observed that at the inner side of the turbulent 
spray flames, where evaporation mainly occurs, the hot pilot transfers 
heat  from  the  intense  reaction  regions  to  the  spray  mixture,  thus 
enhancing  the  evaporation  of  fuel  droplets.  In  turn,  fuel  evaporation 
provides fuel vapor to support the reactions for further expansion [12]. 

2.3.1. Effect of combustion on spray 

Effect  of  combustion  on  species  distribution  and  spray  characteristics. 
Combustion is expected to greatly influence the evolution of the spray 
tip penetration and spray structure as a whole. Pieces of evidence have 
been collected both experimentally based on schlieren imaging [117] 
and numerically using a one-dimensional spray model [60]. The change

in the spray tip penetration and flame structures depends on the initial 
temperature, pressure, density [118], and residence time [59]. In [118], 
the flame structures under different initial gas temperatures and den-
sities were compared, showing that earlier ignition contributes to the 
acceleration  of  spray  tip  penetration  at  a  higher  gas  temperature.  In 
addition, low-temperature chemistry leads to a small decrease in density 
and  accelerates  evaporation.  The  hot  gas  expansion  causes  faster 
transport of fuel vapor in the radial direction [119]. García-Oliver [60] 
revealed that combustion-induced heat release downstream of the flame 
LOL  leads  to  a  strong  change  in  the  flow  pattern,  whereas  chemical 
activity upstream of the flame LOL exhibits very little influence on the 
spray flow. The initial operating conditions also affect the distribution of 
key species within the spray flames. For example, Fig. 12 shows the axial 
flame  structures  during  the  low-temperature  ignition  (LTI)  and  HTI 
stages  and  under  different  oxygen  concentrations  [120].  At  the  early 
stage t1, evaporation of cold fuel droplets results in a decrease in tem-
perature in the near-injector region, where oxygen is insufficient, and 
low-temperature  reactions  are  formed  downstream  of  the  spray  after 
premixing. Hence, a cool flame represented by the CH2O formation re-
gion exists in a wider zone along the axial direction in the spray under 
low oxygen conditions owing to the reduction in the mixture reactivity 
and  the  longer  residence  time.  After  the  high-temperature  kernels 
appear at the periphery of the spray where the gradients of the mixture 
fraction and temperature are not very steep [31], the LTC products are 
quickly consumed but still remain in a wide region. High-density and 
high-pressure environments compress the spray and prevent the flame 
from  dilating  outside.  The  compressing  effect  outweighs  the  gas 
expansion influence although the high-temperature reactions and radial 
expansion appear earlier at high densities [30]. 

The effect of combustion on the spray structures can be determined 
by investigating the difference between the non-reacting and reacting 
conditions. During the early stage (approximately 0.2 ms after the start 
of injection), two sprays injected into environments with and without 
oxygen have similar structures [28]. In the reacting case (with oxygen in 
the ambient gas), a ‘softening’ effect is observed in the schlieren images 
near the head of the spray, indicating LTC, which is also confirmed by 
the formaldehyde distributions. The low-temperature reactions result in 
an  increase  in  temperature,  leading  to  reduced  gradients  in  the  local 
refractive index. Thus, prior to HTI, the tip penetration of the reacting 
spray is slightly longer as a result of the low-temperature reactions [117, 
121]. Subsequently, combustion significantly accelerates the movement 
downstream.  The  reacting  spray  becomes  wider  and  longer  than  the 
nonreacting spray. Fuel type mainly affects the time when the reacting 

spray starts to separate from the inert one. The higher the fuel reactivity, 
the  earlier  the  occurrence  of  autoignition.  In  addition,  after  approxi-
mately  2.0  ms,  the  ratio  of  the  spray  penetration  lengths  under  the 
reacting (Sr) and inert (Si) conditions becomes quasi-steady, indicating 
that the acceleration effect is negligible. 

Effect of combustion on split injections. The combustion of split injections 
is much more complex because both the ignition and structure of the 
second spray are affected by the temperature increase and intermediate 
species in the previously injected spray. The effect of density decrease on 
spray was analyzed well in an LES study of split injections [118], where 
the second injection penetrated a hot environment with a low density as 
a result of the combustion of the previously injected spray. The resis-
tance  met  by  the  second  spray  is  much  lower,  thus  accelerating  the 
movement of spray head downstream. An increase in the axial velocity 
for the second spray was observed in the experiments by Skeen et al. 
[122]. It was found that the second injection enters a ‘slipstream’ pro-
duced by the first injection, promoting mixing for the second injection as 
displayed in Fig. 13 [122]. Similar phenomena were also reported by 
Bolla  et  al.  [123]  using  the  transport  PDF  method.  In  addition,  Moiz 
et al. [124] pointed out that the initial gas temperature also has a sig-
nificant influence on the vapor penetration length. For the case with a 
low initial temperature, the evaporation rate is relatively low. Conse-
quently, the effect of the slipstream becomes small. The DT between split

injections  also  affects  the  mixing  process,  and  a  short  DT  is  prone  to 
increase  the  mixing  rate  at  the  head  of  the  second  injection  [125]. 
Furthermore,  earlier  ignition  of  the  second  spray  accelerates  the 
movement of the second head owing to gas expansion [117]. As a result, 
the  second  injection  moves  downstream  at  a  higher  speed  [118].  It 
should  also  be  noted  that  in  studies  of  the  combustion  effect  on  the 
spray,  the  radiative  heat  transfer  plays  a  role  in  droplet  evaporation, 
which will be quantitatively analyzed in later sections. 

2.3.2. Effect of spray on combustion 

The continuous and dispersed phases influence each other because of 
the momentum and energy exchange at the droplet surface. The atom-
ization and evaporation of cold fuel provide an ignitable mixture that 
may  undergo  a  multistage  ignition  process.  Split  injection  strategies 
involve a strong spray–combustion interaction, which affects the igni-
tion [122,126], flame structure [127], and soot formation [122,128]. 
Once the injection is split into two injections, the ignition process and 
flame structures are strongly influenced by the first injection, and the 
already burnt flame shows intense interaction with the upcoming second 
injection  with  respect  to  the  ignition  process,  flame  structures,  and 
pollutant emissions. 

2.3.2.1. Effect  of  spray  on  ignition. The effect of spray on the ignition 
process is due to the fact that the continuous injection is split, which 
gives  rise  to  different  ignition  processes  depending  on  the  design  pa-
rameters, for example, the initial gas temperature. Scatters of the tem-
perature  and  CH2O  mass  fraction  in  the  mixture  fraction  space  at 
different ambient temperatures are illustrated in Fig. 14.  The already 
formed intermediate species and hot environment can proceed with the 
formation  of  high-temperature  kernels  in  the  second  injection,  thus 
shortening the ID time. The temperature increase has the most signifi-
cant  influence,  followed  by  the  formation  of  species,  i.e.,  CH2O  and 
H2O2 [129]. As pointed out in a previous study [124], high-temperature 
kernels  are  only  formed  after  the  end  of  the  second  injection  by 
decreasing the initial temperature to 750 K, leading to an extremely long 
mixing time for the fuel and air. The injected fuel mass during the first 
injection  is  very  small,  approximately  1.18  mg.  Thus,  the  fuel–air 
mixture  becomes  too  lean  to  initiate  high-temperature  kernels.  When 
the subsequent injection interacts with the already formed cool-flame 
products,  high-temperature  kernels  appear  in  the  second  injection, 
which is confirmed by formaldehyde planar laser-induced fluorescence 
(PLIF)  images.  Thus,  the  interaction  between  the  two  injections  pro-
motes  spray  ignition.  However,  at  higher  ambient  temperatures,  i.e., 

900 K and 800 K, high-temperature reactions appear twice for the split 
injections. The earlier ignition of the second injection heats the region 
close to the injector, thus promoting the evaporation of fuel droplets. 
Hence, the liquid penetration length is also reduced. After ignition, the 
high-temperature burning zone induced by the second injection moves 
slightly  downstream  of  the  liquid  length,  and  before  the  combustion 
recession, the flame LOL of the second injection approached the injector. 
Furthermore, injection parameters, such as the DT, can change the 
ignition mechanism for the second injection. For the case with a short 
DT, the already formed high-temperature region strongly influences the 
second  injection,  which  can  be  more  likely  ignited  by  the  hot  flame. 
However, by extending the DT, the second injection requires more time 
to  interact  with  the  first  one.  Autoignition  controls  the  combustion 
process again [130]. The interactions between two injections are very 
limited if the DT is very long, and combustion of the second injection 
may  initiate at  a time when  the combustion arising  from the first in-
jection is diminished or extinguished [127,130]. As a result, the effects 
of  the  temperature  increase  and  intermediate  species  due  to  the  re-
actions in the first injection on the second spray are very limited. At the 
same time, the oxidizer in the surrounding gas supplies the consumption 
in the first injection, which promotes the ignition of the second injec-
tion, but its effect is insignificant. For the case with a short DT, once the 
second injection interacts with the high-temperature or cool-flame re-
gion because of the reactions in the first injection, the high-temperature 
kernels appear very quickly. By reducing the DT, the spray–combustion 
interaction  between  two  injections  becomes  more  intense,  leading  to 
high soot emissions due to the insufficient mixing time [127]. However, 
experimental results [126] showed that the variations in the ID of the 
second injection with different DTs are negligible. This may be attrib-
uted to the small variations in DTs for different cases. The time interval 
when  the  second  injection  catches  up  with  the  first  one  is  very  short 
owing to the acceleration effect of the first injection. 

2.3.2.2. Effect of spray on flame structures 

Effect of DT. When a single injection is split into two injections, the 
flame structure is significantly affected [131]. Cung et al. [127] reported 
that at a short DT, the flame has high-temperature regions in its middle 
section because of the location of the first flame which is bypassed by the 
high-momentum less-combusted flame from the second injection. After 
a long DT, the flame from the first injection cools down and the second 
flame is warmed up gradually by the hot products of the first injection. 
Intensity  axial  time  (IXT)  [132]  plots  can  be  used  to  indicate  the 
flame LOL location, flame height, and even the internal flame structure

low-temperature reactions occur in the radial periphery of the spray jet, 
producing  different  intermediate  species  and  radicals,  such  as  RO2, 
CH2O,  and  H2O2  [16,28].  As  a  result,  the  turbulent  cool-flame  wave 
propagates  from  the  initiation  location  to  both  the  upstream  and 
downstream locations [133]. Fig. 15 shows the CH2O formation region 
moves  toward  the  upstream  location  at  1.0  ms  for  the  case  with  the 
shortest  DT.  The  OH  and  C2H2  regions  move  upstream  toward  the 
injector nozzle; however, the upcoming cold fuel pushes the CH2O for-
mation downstream with a smaller maximum value for the IXT plots in 
the  second spray. Owing to the  limited mixing time and  oxygen con-
centration ahead of the second spray, higher levels of C2H2 are observed 
especially for the case with the shortest DT. However, for a longer DT, 
fresh air enters into the low-density and already burnt regions, leading 
to an increase in the oxidizer concentration. Hence, the C2H2  concen-
tration in the second spray is significantly reduced. In addition, Fig. 15 
clearly illustrates the strong spray–flame interactions can be affected by 
the DT. By enlarging the time interval between the two injections, the 
consumption of fuel in the first injection becomes more complete. Less 
CH2O  and  OH  formation  regions  overlapped  in  the  two  injections, 
indicating  that  the  influence  of  the  first  spray  on  the  ignition  and 

combustion of the second one is reduced. The spray–flame interaction 
between the two injections is less intense when a longer DT is used. An 
increase in the entrainment rate causes less C2H2 formation. 

Effect of injection duration. The injection duration affects the amount 
of  injected  fuel  mass  and  concentration  of  the  subsequently  formed 
ignitable mixture. Desantes et al. [126] compared the combustion pro-
cess for double injections with different durations of the first injection. 
They found that neither the ID nor flame LOL for the second injection 
was  affected  by  the  duration  of  the  first  injection  because  the 
near-nozzle flow was not modified. However, a longer duration of the 
first injection could contribute to the prolongation of the ID because the 
cold fuel vapor penetrated the pre-ignition region and pushed the hot 
pool with intermediate species downstream. As a result, the appearance 
of high-temperature kernels was inhibited. 

To further understand the effects of the first injection duration (FID) 
on  the  mechanism  of  local  spray–flame  interaction,  the  temperature 
evolution,  heat  release  rate  and  flame  structures  were  obtained,  as 
shown in Fig. 16 [130]. For the split injection with FID = 0.5 ms, the 
injection durations for the first and second injections were set to 0.5 ms, 
consistent with the experiment [122]. For the pilot-main injection, the 
two injection durations were 0.3 ms and 1.2 ms, respectively, indicating 
that less fuel is injected into the computational domain during the first 
injection  under  the  injection  pressure  of  150  MPa.  These  injection 
strategies significantly affected the heat release process. The first peak is 
formed because of the premixed combustion caused by the first injec-
tion,  while  the  second  one  occurs  because  of  the  heat  release  in  the 
second injection. The early ignition process is less dependent on the FID 
owing to its high reactivity. More fuel is injected into the combustion 
chamber after the first injection, which leads to a fuel-rich mixture and

subsequently  a  higher  peak  value  of  the  apparent  heat  release  rate 
(AHRR)  before  1.2  ms.  However,  for  the  pilot-main  injection,  the 
fuel–air  mixture  is  very  lean  before  the  appearance  of  the  HTI.  As  a 
result, the peak of the AHRR is lower than that of the split injection. It 
can be found that the second peak of the AHRR is relevant to the DT. By 
increasing the DT, the onset of the peak AHRR can be delayed. However, 
the increase in DT will lead to a more complete combustion of fuel in the 
first injection owing to the longer residence time. 

Another  interesting  phenomenon  is  flame  recession  in  the  local 
spray–flame interaction. Both experimental and numerical studies [78, 
122] have confirmed the combustion recession in split injections at a 
high initial temperature of 900 K. This means that the combustion re-
gion moves toward the upstream locations in the near-injector region 
after the end of the first injection. The combustion recession contributes 
to a significant decrease in the ID of the second injection owing to the 
high-temperature region, intermediate species, and radical pools. The 
prediction  of  the  combustion  recession  also  depends  on  the  adopted 
numerical method, as reported in [78], where the RANS method failed 
to  model  the  combustion  recession,  but  the  LES  provided  a  good 
prediction. 

2.3.2.3. Effect  of  spray  on  soot  formation. To understand the effect of 
split injection on soot formation, Fig. 17 compares snapshots of the soot 
zone for single and double injections. It is evident that the structures of 
the fuel-rich zone (Φ > 2) and high-temperature region (T > 1600 K) are 
completely different. At 0.6 ms, an increase in the local temperature is 
observed together with the appearance of soot formation. With the un-
interrupted fuel injection for the single injection, soot is observed in a 
narrow region along the spray center at 0.9 ms. Moreover, nearly all soot 
is oxidized ahead of the upcoming second injection. The results at 1.2 ms 
reveal the influence of the air entrainment due to the injection pausing, 
which in turn promotes premixing and leads to a reduction in the soot 
zone  [131].  In  addition,  an  increase  in  the  injection  duration  or  fuel 
mass of the first injection leads to an increase in soot emission [126]. 
This  may  be  because  an  increase  in  the  injected  fuel  mass  creates  a 
fuel-rich region where soot formation is favored. An overlap between the 
injection  and  combustion  also  contributes  to  the  limitation  of  air 
entrainment. For the case with a short duration, the limited mixing time 
before the ID is sufficient to form a fuel-lean mixture. Thus, nearly no 
soot is formed during the first injection. However, for the case with a 
longer DT of the first injection, a large amount soot is formed, which also 
consumes the oxidizer. Thereafter, the second injection penetrates the 
rich region with hot combustion products formed in the first injection 
and starts to combust. The lack of oxygen and the high temperature in 
this region lead to an increase in soot production. 

2.3.3. Conceptual summary with respect to spray–chemistry interaction 

The underlying mechanism of the spray–chemistry interaction  has

been  reviewed  in  detail  in  this  section.  To  provide  a  general  under-
standing  of  this  phenomenon,  a  conceptual  model  with  respect  to 
spray–chemistry interaction was constructed by Cung et al. [127] based 
on experimental images by varying the DT between two injections, as 
shown in Fig. 18. Compared with the single injection, spray flames for 
the multi-injection process are also associated with spray–spray inter-
action,  which  further  increases  the  complexity.  The  second  spray  is 
injected into a completely different environment compared to the first 
injection, which forms different types of intermediate species. Experi-
mental  images  also  show  that  the  IDs  for  all  second  injections  are 
shortened compared to those of single injections because of the warm 
environment full of intermediate species, which has a significant influ-
ence  on  the  combustion  process  [122,134].  The  shorter  ID  limits  the 
mixing time for fuel and air, producing a richer mixture, which in turn 
affects the heat release process as well as the formation of emissions. The 
movement of the low- and high-temperature regions toward the nozzle 
before the start of the second injection plays a critical role in the ignition 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience86(2021)10093915L. Zhou et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

[135]. Once ignited, the kernels grow rapidly, coupled with the growth 
of the existing burning surface (developed by edge-flame propagation). 
In  the  DNS  of  the  two-stage  ignition  process,  the  location  of  the 
low-temperature autoignition may first be initiated in the fuel-lean part 
of  the  dimethyl  ether  (DME)/air  mixture  [136], at  the  stoichiometric 
mixture [137] or on the fuel-rich side of the DME/methane/air mixture 
[138].  The  subsequent  steps  are  similar  in  the  two  mixtures,  which 
consist of (a) formation of a cool flame, (b) propagation of the cool flame 
towards even richer mixture, (c) appearance of high-temperature auto-
ignition kernels, (d) development of edge flames from ignition kernels, 
and  (e)  formation  of high-temperature  flames.  Depending  on the  fuel

and stabilization processes [125]. According to the work by Cung et al. 
[127],  the  mechanism  of  spray–chemistry  interaction  can  be  summa-
rized as follows: 

1)For the first injection, the air entrainment is generated from the 
spray boundary. Subsequently, the fuel is vaporized and an ignitable 
mixture  is  formed.  Under  certain  conditions,  ignition  will  occur 
mostly  in  fuel-rich  mixture  regions,  which  will  cause  a  lack  of 
oxidizer and a high-temperature region for the second injection. 
2)Consequently, the outer boundary region of the mixture in front of 
the  second  injection  is  favorable  for  ignition  under  a  short  DT 
compared to the frontal region. 
3)For a medium DT, the second injection is pushed into a region of 
hot products, and the entire mixture in front of the second injection 
can be ignited. 
4)With  a  further  increase  in  the  DT,  the  second  injection  will  not 
affect the first spray flame, and the effect of the first injection is also 
gradually reduced. 
5)NOx  and soot formation can be decreased by optimizing the split 
injection strategy. 

Therefore,  further  research  regarding  the  interaction  between  the 
local  flow  and  chemistry  timescale,  which  affects  the  ignition  and 
emission  formation  under  different  split  injection  strategies  and 
boundary conditions, is a very challenging task. 

2.4. Characteristics of turbulent spray combustion 

Spray–turbulence–chemistry interactions determine the behavior of 
ignition, combustion, and flame stabilization involving cool and high- 
temperature  flames  at  elevated  pressures  and  temperatures.  This  sec-
tion discusses two important aspects. 

2.4.1. Two-stage ignition mechanism 

Hydrocarbon fuels, especially n-heptane, are often involved in two- 
stage  autoignition,  including  cool  flames  to  HTI  processes  under 
diesel-like  conditions  [135].  A  three-dimensional  DNS  study  of  an 
n-heptane/air  jet  flame  shows  that  LTI  precedes  the  formation  of 
high-temperature kernels in fuel-rich mixtures and at low scalar dissi-
pation  rates and consequently increases the mixture fraction gradient 

For turbulent spray flames in more realistic configurations, the in-
teractions between the local flow, spray, and chemistry are even more 
complex [38,62,63], which have not been fully understood. Related to 
this, two main objectives should be addressed:  

(1)  to  understand  the  two-stage  ignition  process  of  spray  flames 
involving low- and high-temperature reactions, ignition location, 
and early flame evolution; and  

(2)  to understand how the initial conditions, including temperature, 
density,  and  pressure,  influence  the  two-stage  ignition  charac-
teristics and flame structures. 

Some studies [28,120] focused on understanding the mechanism of 
two-stage  ignition  to  determine  the  temporal  evolution  of  the  early 
flame.  During  the  early  stage  after  evaporation,  the  cold  fuel  vapor 
mixes with the hot gas, forming an ignitable mixture. Consequently, it 
reacts with the oxidizer, accompanied by the onset of low-temperature 
chemistry.  During  the  first-stage  ignition  process,  the  fuel  molecules 
are  decomposed  into  various  intermediate  species  with  considerable 
heat release. The LTC also results in a lighter region at the margin of the 
spray  head, as  confirmed by  the experiments  [28],  implying a  conse-
quence of reduced gradients in the local refractive index due to the local 
temperature  increase  after  LTI.  Therefore,  the  intermediate  species 
formed during the first-stage ignition process, such as H2O2, RO2, and 
OH, can be used to study the evolution of the two-stage ignition process 
and determine the influence of the boundary conditions. HTI occurs first 
at a fuel-rich equivalence ratio of approximately 2, based on the tem-
poral evolution in the composition-temperature space for the ambient 
conditions of 1000 K and 21% O2 [9]. The two-stage ignition process of 
n-heptane spray flames based on the evolution of these key intermediate 
products was distinguished in [139]. CH2O is considered as a precursor 
to the first stage of ignition [8,140] and is generally utilized to distin-
guish the ‘cool flame’  in the spray flame under engine-like conditions 
[15]. It is mainly formed in the fuel-lean region at a low temperature of 
850 K, which is followed by HTI in the fuel-rich region, as exhibited in 
Fig. 19. It is further indicated that the first-stage ignition occurs in the 
fuel-lean region first at a low initial temperature. Then, the second-stage

fraction (Zst) [139]) 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience86(2021)10093916L. Zhou et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

ignition moves toward the fuel-rich region. The formation of H2O2 and 
the consumption of RO2  imply the onset of the first-stage ignition be-
tween 1.3 ms and 1.4 ms. The rapid consumption of H2O2 and the for-
mation of OH radical at the stoichiometric locations between 1.5 ms and 
1.6 ms suggest the initialization of the second-stage ignition. Overall, 
different types or modes of ignition exist in turbulent spray combustion, 
depending on the timescales of evaporation, convection, diffusion, and 
chemical reactions. In most cases, autoignition first appears at locations 
with the “most reactive mixture fraction” (Zmr) in nonpremixed mixtures 
and low scalar dissipation rates [29,141]. In turbulent spray flames, the 
reactivity of the fuel–air mixture decreases owing to the fuel evaporation 
effects.  Consequently,  at  a  lower  initial  temperature,  the  fuel-lean 
mixture  easily  locates at  the  most  reactive  mixture  fraction  region  to 
promote ignition occurrence [139]. 

Previous  results  indicate  that  the  combustion  of  spray  flames  is  a 
multistage  and  multimode  process  [5,14,15].  To  distinguish  the 
different combustion modes, i.e., LTC or HTC mode, an analysis based on 
some key intermediate species such as hydroxyl radical (OH) and CH2O 
was performed by Krisman et al. [142]. Different combustion modes for 
multistage processes, namely, the LTC mode (MLTC) associated with the 
first stage of ignition or cool flame, lean-premixed HTC mode (MHTC  (cid:0)
rich),  and  nonpremixed  com-
lean),  rich-premixed  HTC  mode  (MHTC  (cid:0)
bustion mode (MHTC  (cid:0) dif) were distinguished. Their results also reveal 
that during the early stage, the first stage of ignition transitions to a cool 
flame with a slight increase in the heat release rate. After the appearance 
of  low-temperature  chemistry, the  cool  flame  exists during  the  entire 
combustion  process.  The  MLTC  mode  is  important  because  nearly  a 
quarter of the heat is released during this stage. The bulk of the HTC heat 
release rate in the simulation was attributed to either MHTC (cid:0)
rich or MHTC 
(cid:0) dif. Thereafter, the method was also used to identify the key combus-
tion features of n-dodecane flames using DNS [143,144]. In this inves-
tigation, it needs a selection of threshold or critical value of key chemical 
species  was  required  to  identify  the  regions  of  different  combustion 
modes. However, Krisman et al. [142] found that the regions of com-
bustion modes were not very sensitive to the selection of critical value. 
Recently, a LES study first adopted similar definitions to identify the 
LTC and HTC regions in turbulent spray flames [139]. Three combustion 
modes were distinguished based on the mass fractions of CH2O and OH.  

¨ M-LTC mode: YCH2O > YCH2O|CRIT. It represents the LTC region and it 

is associated with the appearance of cool flames.  

¨ M-HTC mode: YCH2O < YCH2O|CRIT∩YOH < YOH|CRIT. This is the HTC 

region with intense high-temperature reactions. 

¨ M-HTC-dif:  YOH  > YOH|CRIT.  It  represents  the  HTC  with  a  non-

premixed flame concentrated on Zst. 

The  results  indicate  that  the  high-temperature  diffusion  region  is 
located in the stoichiometric mixture region and is surrounded by the 
HTC regions with low YCH2O  and YOH, as depicted in Fig. 20. The LTC 
region  with  rich  CH2O  is  located  in  the  upstream  regions.  After  the 
formation of high-temperature kernels, the reaction progress of the fast- 

reacting mixture is mainly limited by the slow local transport, where 
non-premixed  combustion  plays  a  dominant  role  [120].  It  was  found 
that  this  method  has  the  ability  to  distinguish  the  four  combustion 
modes involving the LTC, lean-premixed HTC, rich-premixed HTC, and 
HTC-diffusion combustion for two-stage combustion processes, which is 
similar to the modified flame index method by Briones et al. [145]. 

2.4.2. Flame stabilization mechanism 

Turbulent spray flames can be stabilized at the flame LOL position, 
which is defined as the farthest upstream location where HTC can exist 
along the spray axis. The high-temperature regions cannot move further 
upstream, and the upcoming cold fuel or products formed in the pre- 
oxidized  reactions  start  to  be  consumed  and  penetrate  the  high- 
temperature regions. The detailed spray flame structure and emission 
characteristics are significantly affected by the flame LOL. Therefore, the 
combustion and pollutant emission characteristics in spray flames are 
strongly coupled with the flame lift-off behavior, as revealed by several 
previous studies [146,147]. To reduce soot production, it is very helpful 
if  the  liquid  phase  does  not  penetrate  the  high-temperature  reaction 
region by adopting an ultrahigh injection pressure and a small nozzle 
hole diameter [101], i.e., the flame LOL is much longer than the liquid 
penetration length, preventing the formation of soot emissions. 

Different  theories  have  been  proposed  to  explain  the  stabilization 
mechanisms of turbulent spray flames. Broadwell et al. [148] pointed 
out that large-scale turbulent structures carrying hot combustion prod-
ucts to the edge of the jet can lead to upstream ignition. Otherwise, too 
rapid  mixing  between  the  re-entrained  products  and  the  unburnt  gas 
leads to extinction. Therefore, the interaction of large-eddy structures 
with  hot  products  and  the  unburnt  upcoming  gas  may  result  in  the 
ignition and extinction of turbulent spray flames. Recently, a conceptual 
model  [147]  revealed  that  the  main  stabilization  mechanism  for  the 
spray flame depends on two types of autoignition, namely the isolated 
autoignition and autoignition assisted by the burnt mixture. In addition, 
triple flames were also found at the periphery of the spray flame, which 
had 
to  flame 
stabilization. 

insufficient  propagation  velocity 

to  contribute 

Before the fuel–air mixture is consumed at downstream locations, it 
may undergo low-temperature reactions. The interaction between the 
turbulence and low-temperature products may contribute to the stabi-
lization  process.  Recently,  laser-induced  plasma  ignition  was  used  to 
study  the  stabilization  mechanism  of  turbulent  spray  flames  both 
experimentally [146,149] and numerically [150]. The presence of laser 
ignition leads to a sudden decrease in the flame LOL, which moves to-
ward the upstream direction and becomes steady after a relatively long 
time (approximately 7 ms). The kernel induced by laser ignition prop-
agates  toward  the  main  flame  region  in  a  premixed  regime,  which 
merges with the main flame very rapidly. Experiments also showed the 
importance  of  a  cool  flame  in  assisting  flame  stabilization  [146].  If 
forced ignition by a laser occurs upstream of formaldehyde, the lift-off 
position  moves  rapidly  before  it  reaches  the  formaldehyde  region. 
Thereafter, it returns slowly towards its natural position.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience86(2021)10093917L. Zhou et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

Different  stabilization  mechanisms  can  be  identified  based  on  the 
contour of the heat release rate and flame structures, as illustrated in 
Fig. 21 [151]. It can be observed that at an initial temperature of 900 K, 
the heat release mainly originates from three locations: (1) LTI site, (2) 
autoignition  induced  flame  front  regions  (AIIF,  equal  to  the  HTI  re-
gions), and (3) mixing-controlled diffusion flame region. The LTI prod-
ucts  contribute  to  the  stabilization  process  because  they  affect  the 
location of the AIIF region. However, no AIIF can be found at 1000 K, 
and  the  two  flame  bases  extend  upstream  toward  the  injector.  The 
shorter flame LOL prevents the entrainment of fresh gas into the spray. 
Heat release from the LTI close to the flame LOL indicates that the flame 
propagation is significantly affected by the LTI ignition process. There-
fore,  flame  stabilization  processes  are  controlled  by  the  two-stage 
autoignition  with  an  AIIF  at  900  K  and  the  flame  propagation 
coupling with the LTI at 1000 K. 

Other  theories  have  also  been  used  to  interpret  the  stabilization 
process of turbulent spray flames, such as local extinction owing to the 
high scalar dissipation rate [152], partially premixed flame propagation 
of  triple  flames  [153]  and  autoignition  [31,61,154].  The  transport 
budget analysis proposed by Luo and Bray [51,54] and Gordon et al. 
[155] is a widely used method for identifying the local characteristics of 
a flame based on the relative magnitudes of the reaction, diffusion, and 
convection  terms.  A  larger  reaction  term  compared  to  the  other  two 
terms indicates that autoignition plays a dominant role in the stabili-
zation process of turbulent spray flames [31,61,154]. 

The  autoignition  and  premixed  flame  can  be  clearly  distinguished 
using a preheat zone and a reaction zone. A balance between the reac-
tion and diffusion indicates a diffusive–reactive flame structure. On the 
other  hand,  a  dominant  reaction  term  implies  that  combustion  is 
controlled  by  autoignition  [156].  As  shown  in  Eq.  7  of  the  steady 
modeled  transport  equation  of  the  mean  species  mass  fraction,  the 
equation is balanced by the convection, diffusion, and chemical reaction 
terms.

autoignition process and flame stabilization mechanism, several studies 
[31,61,154]  have  applied  this  method  to  investigate  the  stabilization 
mechanism in turbulent spray flames. All the studies obtained the same 

results and revealed that the reaction rates are much higher than the 
diffusion  rates  near  the  flame  LOL  positions  regardless  of  the  initial 
boundary conditions, indicating that the natural lifted flame is stabilized 
by autoignition. An increase in the initial oxygen concentration signif-
icantly  increases  the  reaction  rates,  while  the  initial  gas  temperature 
plays a less important role, as shown in Fig. 22. The results also suggest 
that  turbulent  diffusion  gradually  increases  with  increasing  tempera-
ture,  which  is  attributed  to  radial  diffusion  [31].  Overall,  it  can  be 
concluded from the budget analysis that the flame stabilization in tur-
bulent spray flames is dominated by autoignition, and turbulent trans-
port of heat also makes a certain contribution to flame stabilization. 

The  stabilization  mechanism  in  turbulent  n-heptane  spray  flames 
based on the analysis of the local chemical time scale and flow time scale 
was further analyzed [120,157]. During the early stage of ignition in the 
spray flame, the reaction and mixing balanced with each other based on 
the analysis of the local flow and chemical timescales. The ratio of the 
integral timescale to the chemical timescale is defined as Da. Large Da 
values  indicate  that  the  chemical  timescale  is  much  smaller  than  the 
flow timescale and the flame is mixing-controlled. On the other hand, 
small  values  imply  a  large  chemical  timescale.  Flame  structures  for 
n-heptane spray flames  in terms of instantaneous temperature,  eigen-
value,  and  Da  number  contours  are  presented  in  Fig.  23.  Here,  Da  is 
defined as Da = τf  × |λe|, where τf represents the integral time scale, 
which is calculated as τf = k/ε. And the log scale of Re(λe) is denoted as 
Λe where Λe = sign(Re(λe)) × log10(max (1,Re(λe))) and ‘sign’ is the sign 
function. A negative Λe indicates that the mixture has already burned. A 
positive Λe  indicates that the ignition of the mixture is still underway 
[158].  It  was  demonstrated  that  multistage  ignition  processes  are 
controlled  by  different  mechanisms  [120].  During  the  early  stage  of 
ignition, the low-temperature reactions in spray flames are initiated at 
the  locations  with  Da  in  the  order  of  unity,  indicating  that  the  spray 
flame is controlled by the balance between reaction and mixing. How-
ever, during the quasi-steady state, a significant increase in terms of the 
Da number is found, signifying that autoignition plays a dominant role. 
In summary, significant progress has been made in the spray–che-
mistry–turbulence  interaction.  The  above  sections  provide  a  compre-
hensive  summary  of  the  mechanism  of  spray–turbulence–chemistry 
interaction  under  engine-like  conditions,  which  can  be  illustrated  in 
Fig.  24.  Different  processes  including  fuel  evaporation,  mixing,  auto-
ignition, and HTC occur during the injection process. The fuel injection 
and  subsequent  evaporation  enable  the  formation  of  an  ignitable 
fuel–air  mixture.  The combustion  of  the  fuel–air mixture,  in  turn,  re-
stricts the entrainment rate of fresh air into the spray, leading to fuel-

rich  ignition  as  shown  in  Fig.  24.  Then,  gas  expansion  as  a  result  of 
combustion increases the turbulence intensity and causes acceleration of 
the spray head [120], leading to a longer reacting spray. The accelera-
tion effect is more obvious with multi-injection because of the reduction 
in the resistance ahead of the subsequent injection [118]. 

The  interactions  are  expected  to  influence  the  spray  structure.  In-
jection with a higher pressure leads to a longer vapor penetration length 
and stronger turbulence intensity, which can promote fuel–air mixing, 
thus shortening the ID [4]. Although earlier ignition leads to a longer 
spray  structure,  the  structure  is  also  affected  by  the  ambient  gas.  A 
higher  ambient  density  intensifies  the  resistance,  which  restricts  the 
development  of  the  spray  tip,  leading  to  a  reduction  in  the  vapor 
penetration.  In  summary,  a  turbulent  spray  is  formed  owing  to  the 
breakup  of  cold  fuel  droplets,  which  are  then  dispersed,  heated,  and 
vaporized. A ‘cool-flame’ structure is located between the liquid phase 
and the HTC region, characterized by a high concentration of CH2O. The 
high turbulence due to high-speed injection enhances the heat losses and 
leads to a local balance between the flow and reaction during the early 
stage  of  ignition.  However,  autoignition  dominates  the  stabilization 
process. The turbulent spray structure determines the entrainment rate 
and  most  of  the  fresh  air  enters  the  spray  through  the  spray  head, 
although a longer flame LOL can lead to better fuel/air mixing. 

In addition, the interaction process between double injections also 
leads to a completely different ignition mechanism compared with the 
single injections, as identified by the chemical explosive mode analysis 
[130].  The  combustion  of  the  first  injection  is  mainly  controlled  by 
autoignition, whereas that of the second injection is directly ignited by 
the  high-temperature  reacting  spray  with  short  dwell  time.  However, 
autoignition can play a critical role if a longer DT is used [130]. Under 
low  reactivity  conditions,  for  example,  low  temperature  and/or  low 
oxygen concentration, turbulence controls the ignition process because 
the  already  formed  intermediate  species  and  released  heat  are  trans-
ported by turbulence. The combustion mode can be changed from LTC to 
cool-flame  propagation  mode  [133]  and  diffusion-controlled  mode. 
However, quantitative analysis of the effect of local spray characteristics 
in  turbulent spray  flames on  ignition, especially cool-flame  stage and 
combustion mode transition, should be further conducted. In addition, 

previous  studies  only  focused  on  the  ignition  mechanism  of  a 
single-component fuel; however, a real engine fuel with multiple com-
ponents in turbulent spray flames will result in more complicated igni-
tion and flame stabilization mechanisms, which have not been studied 
well. 

3. Other effects in realistic spray combustion systems 

3.1. Turbulence–radiation interaction (TRI) 

Radiative heat transfer plays a very critical role in energy balance 
and is known to have an effect on the wall heat loss in engines, partic-
ularly for large bore and heavy-duty diesel engines [159]. For turbulent 
nonpremixed flames, radiation can contribute substantially to the pre-
diction of the temperature field and emission formation. In most con-
ventional  reacting  flow  simulations  (i.e.,  RANS),  radiation  and 
turbulence are treated as independent processes, and the mean variables 
are used to calculate radiative intensities and properties, which makes it 
difficult  to  consider  TRI  [160].  Previous  experimental  and  numerical 
studies [161-164] have demonstrated that TRI can substantially affect 
radiative heat loss [165,166], and considering turbulent fluctuations in 
radiation calculation can elevate the radiative fluxes by up to 2–3 times. 
However,  little  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  effect  of  TRI  on  the 
combustion and emission characteristics of turbulent spray flames under 
engine-like conditions. For the radiation effect on droplet evaporation, 
radiation takes the role of heat transfer from high temperature flame to 
the  unburned  gas  and  spray  droplets  [167],  which  accelerates  the 
droplets evaporation as spray droplets far away from flame, and in turn 
the flame temperature reduces due to radiation acting as energy sink. 
For the spray flame, the two important aspects should be considered. 
The first is to assess the importance of the TRI effects on heat transfer 
losses and emissions. The second is to distinguish the impact weight of 
molecular gas radiation and soot emission from the TRI effect. 

Several  studies  [11,77,168,169]  regarding  the  effect  of  TRI  on 
combustion  and  emission  characteristics  have  been  conducted  by 
employing  different  radiative  models  with  and  without  considering 
turbulent fluctuations. It can be concluded from the above studies that 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience86(2021)10093919L. Zhou et al.

TRI  effects  are  attributed  to  the  periphery  of  the  turbulent  flame, 
particularly the region of the highly intermittent soot formation in terms 
of turbulent spray flames [11]. TRI can enhance radiative heat transfer 
and thus lead to a drop in the peak temperature by 10–20 K [77]. And a 
larger  decrease  in  the  peak  temperature  by  150  K  (for  a  luminous, 
optically thicker flame) was also found [169]. Because NO emission is 
more sensitive to the temperature than soot production, the reduction in 
temperature results in a decrease in NO mass by 5–10%, and the effect of 
radiation on soot formation is insignificant due to the less temperature 
independent [77]. 

However, neglecting the unresolved turbulent fluctuations causes an 
increase in the NO mass by a factor of two. It can be found from the 
turbulent spray flame in a simple configuration that global TRI effects on 
heat losses and NO are relatively small compared to the TCI effect [77, 
168].  However,  radiative  emission  generated  by  soot  approximately 
doubles when considering the TRI effect owing to the highly intermit-
tent soot distribution. Fig. 25 presents the temporal evolution of the NO 
mass obtained with (for the transported PDF model) and without (for the 
well-mixed model) the TRI effects using two different radiation models, 
i.e.,  the  discrete  ordinate  method  (DOM)  and  optically  thin  (OPT) 
models, as well as no radiation (No Rad). It can be observed that radi-
ation  causes  a  decrease  in  the  total  NO  formation  by  approximately 
5–10% for both the DOM and OPT models. However, when isolating and

quantifying  the  TRI  effects,  neglecting  the  TCI  caused  a  larger  peak 
flame temperature and a much thinner reaction zone, leading to an in-
crease in the total NO mass by up to two times compared to the TCI effect 
using the transport PDF turbulent combustion model. Actually, the ef-
fect of TRI on the emitted radiation was found to be modest (10% at 
most) when using the transport PDF method. The results implied that the 
influence  of  radiation  on  NO  emission  is  considerable  but  generally 
smaller  than  that  of  the  selected  combustion  models.  The  above 
conclusion  is  further  confirmed  in  a  heavy-duty  diesel  engine  [170], 
where both radiative emission and reabsorption are considered at part 
load and full load. In [170], to separate the TCI effect from the TRI ef-
fect, both TCI and TRI effects were considered by using particle-level 
chemistry  and  radiation.  However,  only  the  TCI  effect  was  obtained 
by the particle-level chemistry and cell-level radiation. It was found that 
local  instantaneous  temperatures  were  changed  by  50–100  K  when 
employing a radiation model for various combustion models and radi-
ation models. However, the global influence was relatively small (less 
than 10%) in terms of heat losses and engine-out emissions. The results 
also imply that the TRI effect is negligible (less than 10%), and the WSR 
combustion model used does not change the results. 

In addition, to evaluate the importance of molecular gas radiation 
(mostly CO2 and H2O) and soot radiation, the power spectra of radiation 
emitted over the full domain and of radiation reaching the walls were 
utilized [11]. The spectra and computed fields of radiative emission as 
well as the net radiative source terms were analyzed. It was confirmed 
that the total radiative emission and reabsorption are dominated by CO2 
because of its large optical thickness at the wavenumbers of the system 
as well as a negative correlation with temperature, which is a plausible 
cause for the lower TRI effect compared to the larger effect of TRI re-
ported  for  atmospheric  turbulent  nonluminous  and  luminous  flames 
[77]. On the other hand, most CO2 is reabsorbed before reaches the wall, 
while H2O radiation dominates the radiative energy flux to the walls. In 
addition, it can be concluded that the contribution of soot radiation is 
very small compared to the molecular gas radiation [168,170]. 

In summary, significant progress has been made in investigating the 
effects  of  turbulence–radiation–spray  interactions  on  the  combustion 
characteristics.  The  existing  studies  based  on  numerical  simulation 
indicate that the TRI effect is smaller than the TCI effect. Quantitative 
measurements regarding the effect of TRI should be carried out. How-
ever, spray combustion is a complicated process, and the effects of tur-
bulence–radiation–spray interactions under a wide range of engine-like 
conditions, such as the TRI effect on droplet evaporation, require further 
in-depth studies. 

3.2. Spray flame–wall interactions 

Spray-wall  interaction  (SWI)  and  flame-wall  interaction  (FWI)  are 
among the most important considerations for the combustion chamber 
design of internal combustion engines [171,172], gas turbines [173] and 
rocket engines [174]. These issues are especially relevant to downsize or 
light-duty engines. In diesel engines, the impinging spray flame has a 
substantial effect on the distribution of fuel, evaporation, fuel–air mix-
ing, combustion, and even exhaust emissions. A recent comprehensive 
review  regarding  the  premixed  FWI  considering  advanced  laser  di-
agnostics  was  presented  by  Dreizler  and  B¨ohm  [175].  However,  the 
complex interactions among the incident spray, flame, and wall are still 
far from being fully understood. An in-depth analysis of all the related 
processes is beyond the scope of this work, and here, we only briefly 
review the development of the spray flame–wall interaction mechanism 
including  spray-wall  impingement  and  spray  flame-wall  interaction 
(spray FWI). 

3.2.1. Spray–wall interaction 

The phenomena of spray–wall interaction under real engine condi-
tions is difficult to describe owing to the complex in-cylinder flow, in-
jection,  and  heat  release  processes.  Thus,  studies  including  single 

droplet impingement and spray/group droplet impingement were usu-
ally performed in simplified constant-volume combustion chambers to 
qualitatively investigate the key phenomenon. There are three typical 
conditions for single droplet impingement studies: dry surfaces, wetted 
surfaces, and hot walls. Droplet impingement on dry surfaces frequently 
occurs in nature and in a variety of industrial and agricultural applica-
tions [176]. The topic has been studied for over a century, but there is 
still disagreement even regarding the basic mechanisms involved [177, 
178].  However,  this  review  only  focuses  on  the  spray/group  droplet 
impingement. Fig. 26 presents the main features of spray impingement 
on the wall [20], including the primary liquid film formation, splash, 
secondary  impingement  of  splashing  droplets,  and  vortex–droplets 
interaction. 

Many studies have been conducted to investigate spray–wall inter-
action.  Most  of  the  experimental  studies  have  focused  on  the  macro-
scopic  features,  such  as  spray  morphology,  spray  penetration,  Sauter 
mean diameter of droplets, and wall film characteristics [179,180]. In 
the recent works by Xu et al. [179,180], advanced optical methodologies 
were employed to investigate the liquid film formation mechanism near 
the impingement wall. It was concluded that the spray can substantially 
affect the wall film movement and further induce secondary breakup. 
They also proposed a spray impingement criterion to explain the cause 
of droplet gliding away without impinging the wall induced by the lift 
force of the boundary layer. In addition, Chen et al. [181] investigated 
the  spray  characteristics  of  a  wall-impinging  diesel  fuel  spray  with 
various wall temperatures in a constant-volume combustion vessel. They 
found that by increasing the wall temperature, the vapor-rich field en-
ters the  near-wall region, and the area of high-vapor fluorescence in-
tensity increases. 

In numerical simulations, an established configuration to study the 
spray  impingement  is  that  of  a  single  droplet  impinging  on  a  dry  or 
wetted wall [182]. However, under certain conditions, such a configu-
ration cannot accurately capture the characteristics of spray impinge-
ment [183,184], which has been systematically summarized by Moreira 
et al. [185]. If droplet–droplet interaction in dense spray is neglected, 
the behavior of the spray–wall interaction will be altered. Consequently, 
there are still many unresolved issues regarding the transition between 
deposition and splash, droplet–droplet interaction, and liquid fuel film 
formation under different conditions. 

Considering  the  above  issues,  some  studies  were  performed  using 
simplified  flow configurations  [186-188].  Naber and  Reitz  [188]  pio-
neered  the  modelling  of  spray–wall  interaction  by  identifying  three 
different regimes, namely stick, reflect, and jet, but the splash regime 
and  the  loss  of  energy  and  momentum  of  the  impinged  droplet  are 
neglected. O’Rourke and Amsden [189] presented a spray–wall inter-
action model based on experimental data by considering the deposition 
and splash regimes, which have been successfully been added into the 
KIVA code and other commercial software; however, the model cannot 
describe the realistic spray shape under engine-like conditions [190]. In 
the  O’Rourke  and  Amsden  model  [189],  a  dimensionless  splashing

criterion is proposed with consideration of the effect of the film thick-
ness and boundary layer thickness For the secondary droplet, O’Rourke 
and Amsden [189] adopted two distribution functions to describe the 
normal and tangential velocities as follows:

where  wmax  = 0.2w0  and  δ  = 0.1w0.  Then,  the  total  velocity  of  the 
secondary droplet can be expressed as: 
)

(10)  

where n and et  are the unit vectors normal and tangential to the wall, 
respectively,  and  ep  is  the  unit  vector,  which  is  normal  to  n  and  et 
simultaneously. 

Further  improvement  in  the  spray–wall  interaction  model  by 
considering  the  liquid  saturation  temperature,  low-energy  impinge-
ment,  and  high-energy  impingement  was  established  by  Senda  et  al. 
[191,192].  The  secondary  breakup  induced  by  a  splash  for  the 
low-energy impingement case and the deposition and splash processes 
for the high-energy impingement case were considered. Based on pre-
vious  works,  Zhang  et  al.  [193]  improved  the  spray–wall  interaction 
model with special emphasis on the high-injection pressure condition 
and achieved reasonably accurate predictions for the penetration of the 
impinging sprays and the secondary droplet characteristics compared to 
experimental data. They further improved the model by considering the 
film  separation  criterion,  mass  ratio  of  the  film  separation,  and  film 
atomization model based on the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability theory 
[194]. The results showed good agreement between the predicted size 
distribution of the detached droplets and the experimental data using 
the  improved  model,  as  shown  in  Fig.  27.  The  improved  model 
demonstrated a better ability of capturing film separation characteris-
tics.  In  the  wall  film  separation  model  by  Zhang  et  al.  [194],  a  new 
separation criterion coupled with the film atomization model based on 
the RT instability theory is adopted: 

fR =

ρlu2

f sinθc

σ(1 + sinθc) + Lbhfρlgcosθc

(11)  

where fR is the force ratio, σ is the liquid surface tension, and Lb is the 
film characteristic breakup length. In the film atomization model, the 
following dispersion equation is utilized:

where  ωf  is  the  growth  rate,  κ  is  the  wavenumber,  and  af  is  the  film 
acceleration around the corner. By maximizing the above equation, the 

growth  rate  of  the  fastest-growing  wave  on  the  liquid  film  can  be 
calculated.  Furthermore,  the  wavelength  of  the  fastest  growing  wave 
can be obtained based on the relationship between the growth rate and 
wavenumber. Cylindrical ligaments are assumed to be produced after 
film  separation,  and  the  diameter  of  the  cylindrical  ligaments  can  be 
determined  based  on  mass  conservation.  Finally,  the  ligaments  are 
supposed to further break into the detached droplets of various sizes, 
and  the  size  distribution  of  the  detached  droplets  is  described  by  a 
Rosin–Rammler distribution function. 

In summary, the development of the spray–wall interaction model 
should consider the following issues: 1) effect of turbulence on droplet/ 
wall interaction; 2) wall conditions of dry wall, wetted wall, inclined 
wall  surface,  and  rough  wall;  3)  impingement  regimes  and  transition 
criteria; 4) energy conservation; 5) effect of liquid film thickness and 
film separation criterion; 6) estimation of post-impingement character-
istics including rebound velocity, fraction of the mass deposited on the 
wall, droplet size, and velocity distributions of the secondary droplets 
for the splash regime [190]. 

3.2.2. Spray flame–wall interaction 

Combustion characteristics such as flame structure and emissions are 
greatly  affected  by  the  spray  flame-liquid  film–turbulence–wall  in-
teractions.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  by  measurements  and 
numerical simulations in both engines and constant-volume combustion 
chambers to study the effect of spray flame-wall. 

Flame morphology. Compared to the studies on the spray–wall interac-
tion,  those  on  the  spray  flame-wall  interaction  is  relatively  scarce. 
Generally,  when  a  jet  encounters  a  wall,  the  leading  edge  frequently 
deforms,  flattening  the  diffusion  flame  along  the  wall  surface  [195]. 
Compared with a free spray flame, combustion can be strengthened by 
using an appropriate impinging distance (longer than the liquid-phase 
penetration)  [196].  From  previous  studies,  it  can  be  concluded  that 
the injection parameters and operation conditions, including the wall 
conditions  [181],  injection  pressure  [197,198],  impinging  distance 
[196],  nozzle  hole  diameter,  and  ambient  pressure  [181],  mainly 
determine the combustion processes. The ultrahigh injection pressures 
and microhole size nozzle can affect the flame structure, including the 
flame area, flame length and flame height. It was found that a higher 
injection  pressure  resulted  in  a  larger  flame  length  and  flame  area; 
however, the flame height was independent of the injection pressure but 
dependent on the nozzle hole diameter [198]. A smaller hole diameter 
led to a lower flame height. Furthermore, the heat flux increased owing 
to  the  increased  convection  due  to  turbulence  induced  by  the  higher 
injection pressure and larger nozzle hole diameter. In addition, a larger 
impingement  distance  (50  mm)  can  lead  to  a  smaller  value  of  the 
average heat flux owing to the prolonged combustion duration and small 
flame contact area [197]. Recently, Chen et al. [181] identified the ef-
fects of different wall temperatures and ambient pressures on the flame 
characteristics, including ignition position, flame area, and height in a 
constant-volume  combustion  vessel,  as  shown  in  Fig.  28.  They

concluded that the flame area and height are more sensitive to the wall 
temperature at a lower ambient pressure. Increasing the wall tempera-
ture  promotes  the  ignition  process  and  decreases  the  flame  area  and 
height. Overall, only a limited number of experimental and computa-
tional  studies  have  been  devoted  to  the  autoignition  mechanism, 
including  the  two-stage  ignition  process  near  the  wall  for  impinging 
turbulent spray flames. 

Formation of pollutants. The flame development is affected by the wall 
heat loss corresponding to the heat transfer from the reacting flame to 
the  relatively  low-temperature  liquid  film  or  wall.  This  leads  to  the 
formation of UHC and consequently the formation of pollutants, espe-
cially  soot.  Experimental studies on  the  effect of spray/wall  impinge-
ment on emissions, particularly soot formation, were carried out in both 
engines [199] and constant-volume chambers [181,200,201]. Bruneaux 
[200]  presented  the  flame  structure  of  an  impinging  jet  by  simulta-
neously  employing  formaldehyde,  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons 
(PAH), and OH laser-induced fluorescence techniques, as well as spec-
tral analysis, which allows a comprehensive understanding of the flame 
structures and soot formation, as shown in Fig. 29. It can be observed 
that  the  jet  impinging-wall  flame  is  substantially  influenced  by  the 
jet–wall  vortex, which  can generate  a higher  mixing rate. The higher 
mixing rate results in broader regions of OH in the tip region and reduces 
the formation of PAHs and soot in this region. In addition, near the wall 
region, spray impingement results in soot formation. 

Many studies [198,202,203] were carried out to reveal the mecha-
nism of soot formation during the spray–wall interaction. Pickett and 
Lopez  [204]  investigated  the  soot  formation  in  a  diesel  fuel  jet 
impingement on a wall using the PLIF technology. They found that soot 
formation was smaller for a plane wall jet compared to a free jet under 
diesel engine-like conditions. Two possible explanations were given for 
this conclusion: (1) the wall impingement can promote the mixing of 
fuel vapor and ambient air [205], which reduces soot formation; (2) the 
jet–wall  interaction leads to  a decrease in temperature near the wall, 
which results in a slower rate of soot formation. However, according to 
the findings by Wang et al. [198] and Li et al. [196,202], the jet–wall 
interaction worsens the combustion substantially compared with that in 
a free spray flame, which yields more unburnt fuel and soot based on 
different  injection  pressures  and  injector  nozzles.  They  further  found 
that an ultrahigh injection pressure can result in a relatively lower soot

level, especially for the micro-hole size of 0.08 mm. Chen et al. [181] 
attributed this difference to different wall temperatures. They concluded 
that a higher wall temperature easily leads to the formation of more soot 
in the flame. 

The  mechanisms  of  the  wall  effect  on  the  soot  production  can  be 

summarised as follows: 

1)Increased soot formation: The wall temperature has a substantial 
influence on the evaporation of the deposited liquid film on the wall. 
By increasing wall temperature, a richer fuel–air mixture is formed in 
the area near the wall due to the evaporation of the liquid film, which 
becomes the source of soot formation [181]. 
2)Decreased  soot  formation:  An  increase  in  the  fuel  mixing  with 
ambient air is achieved owing to the jet vortex effect [205], which 
finally reduces soot formation and enhances soot oxidation [204]. 
Pickett and Lopez [204] also pointed out that a small portion of soot 
deposits onto the wall. In fact, the mixing process also depends on the 
spray parameters such as the spray angle and injection pressure. 

In summary, the wall conditions including wall temperature, dry/ 
wetted wall, and rough or smooth wall can significantly affect the soot 
formation process. However, the spray flame-wall interaction involving

the multi-stage ignition process is rather complex and not fully under-
stood; thus, further studies are necessary. 

Spray  flame/liquid  film–turbulence–wall  interactions. The wall heat flux 
also plays a vital role in the spray flame in an engine-like environment, 
which  affects  the  ignition  process  and  can  quench  the  flame  [175]. 
However, very limited studies on the spray flame-wall interaction have 
considered  the  effect of the wall  heat flux. The heat transfer  process, 
especially  in  an  internal  combustion  engine,  is  controlled  by  forced 
convection, which is substantially affected by the mean gas flow, tur-
bulence,  premixed flame  propagation,  and spray  impingement  on the 
combustion  chamber  walls.  All  these  factors  contribute  to  a  transient 
heat flux, leading to a rapidly changing temporal and spatial tempera-
ture distributions at the surface of the combustion chamber walls [206, 
207].  Fig.  30  presents  a  brief  mechanism  for  the  mutual  interaction 
between  spray,  flame,  wall,  and  turbulence  based  on  several  studies 
[175,207,208]. The three key processes are: 

1)The first process (spray–flame–wall): The heat flux characteristics 
change  owing  to  the  existence  of  the  liquid  film.  The  wall  with  a 
liquid  film  can  quench  the  flame  because  of  the  heat  loss  corre-
sponding to the heat transfer from the flame to the relatively low- 
temperature  liquid  film,  which  affects  the  pollutant  formation, 
especially soot. In addition, the high-temperature burnt mixture with 
active radicals can react and promote liquid film evaporation. The 
wall also limits the flame wrinkling, and the liquid fuel can be burned 
on the wall, which affects the heat load of the wall and further causes 
the heat losses. However, different from the flame interaction with a 
dry wall, as the flame approaches the fuel film on the wall, the peak 
combustion  temperature  can  increase  because  of  the  increased 
equivalence ratio due to film evaporation [209]. 
2)The second process: Turbulence dominates the liquid distribution 
and liquid film thickness, which further affects the mixture forma-
tion.  Similarly,  the  wall  changes  the  liquid  droplet  motion  and 
further influences the mixture formation. Meanwhile, a cold liquid 
film  or  spray  can  change  the  turbulent  velocity  and  temperature 
boundary layer. 
3)The  third  process:  The  flame  can  affect  turbulence  due  to  the 
expansion of the flame front induced by combustion and the viscosity 
increase in the burnt gases. However, the effect is weakened by the 
existence of a low-temperature liquid film. In addition, turbulence 
can wrinkle and strain the flame surface and promote the burning 
rate. In turn, turbulence also promotes heat transfer loss, which leads 
to flame extinction. 

In  summary,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  spray  flame-
–wall–turbulence interactions for new insights and engine performance 
improvement.  Even with the  significant advances made over  the past 
decades, major  gaps in  understanding the  complex  mechanism of the 

Fig. 30. Mechanism of the mutual interactions between the spray, flame, wall, 
and turbulence 

spray  flame–wall–turbulence  interactions  still  exist.  These  can  be 
addressed  through  the  following  superordinate  topics:  1)  turbulent 
spray FWI on the dry wall and liquid film under real engine-like con-
ditions with high-precision experiments and high-fidelity simulations; 
2)  the  effect  of  different  turbulent  intensities  on  the  droplet  motion, 
flame propagation, heat transfer from the wall, and soot emissions in 
terms of spray FWIs. 

4. Further challenges 

Despite the significant progress made so far, several challenges and 
important problems remain in the turbulent spray flame field, such as 
the  turbulence–spray–combustion  interactions  in  a  supercritical  envi-
ronment and in methane–air mixture, which generally occur in marine 
diesel engines and dual-fuel engines. 

4.1. Supercritical spray flame 

Currently,  research  on  supercritical  spray  is  becoming  important 
because of the need for the development of high-pressure combustion 
devices  [210,211].  With  new  combustion  technologies,  the  average 
pressure in diesel engines exceeds the critical pressure of most hydro-
carbon  fuels.  For  liquid-propellant  rockets,  the  pressure  under  the 
working conditions is even higher. Fuel injection in such engines always 
occurs  in  supercritical  regimes.  Compared  with  subcritical  situations, 
fluids  under  supercritical  conditions  exhibit  different  characteristics. 
Their surface tension and latent enthalpy values tend to approach zero, 
and the gas–liquid interface disappears, making the two-phase division 
in the traditional sense meaningless. Instead, fluids are described to be 
in the supercritical phase, where their density behaves similar to a liquid 
with its transport characteristics behaving like gas. When liquid fluids 
approach  the  supercritical  phase,  their  thermodynamic  and  transport 
parameters  such  as  specific  heat,  viscosity,  and  thermal  conductivity 
change remarkably. The solubility of gases in liquids also undergoes an 
abrupt  change.  Consequently,  the  structure  of  a  supercritical  spray  is 
completely different from that of a subcritical spray. The supercritical 
spray process involves two key points: the evaporation rate and transi-
tion  of  the  fuel–air  mixing  process  from  the  two-phase  breakup  and 
evaporation  processes  to  single-phase  diffusion-controlled  mixing 
[212-214]. Significant advances have been made in recent years in un-
derstanding supercritical spray flames from the microscale [212,215] to 
the macro-spray process [213,214]. However, many unsolved problems 
remain, and it is necessary to address future challenges of supercritical 
spray flames in the following areas: 

1) Although systematic theories on supercritical  droplet behaviors 
have  been  developed,  the  existing  studies  regarding  the  high- 
pressure  spray  flame  mechanisms  are  still  limited  [214,216]. 
High-fidelity experiments and numerical simulations are required to 
explain  the  mechanisms  of  supercritical  jet  atomization  and  com-
bustion processes. 
2) Quantitative methods for calculating the gasification rate of su-
percritical  droplets  are  insufficient,  especially  for  multicomponent 
droplets.  Experiments  have  been  performed  to  obtain  the  droplet 
lifetime in different situations [217,218], but an accurate theoretical 
formula  for  predicting  the  high-pressure  fuel  gasification  rate  is 
necessary. For static spray, Li et al. [219] proposed a constant rate 
evaporation  model,  which  assumes  that  the  gasification  rate  of  a 
supercritical liquid is maintained at the value of the critical point. 
For droplets in a forced convection environment, Litchford and Jeng 
[220]  proposed  a  stripping  evaporation  rate  model  based  on  the 
pneumatic stripping theory. However, the accuracy of both models 
needs to be evaluated further. 
3) Reliable multiphase numerical simulation techniques are required 
under supercritical conditions with the disappearance of a distinct 
phase  interface.  Studies  using  liquid  breakup  and  atomization 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience86(2021)10093924L. Zhou et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

models based on the subcritical KH-RT theory would introduce er-
rors.  Simeoni  [210]  and  Banuti  [211,221]  observed  a  diesel  jet 
injected into a nitrogen environment under supercritical conditions. 
The  supercritical 
interface  was  found  to  be  a  continuous 
turbulence-mixing  layer  and  can  be  divided  into  three  different 
areas: a liquid-like area in the jet core region near the nozzle, a su-
percritical gas-like area at the edge of the jet, and a transition area 
between the two areas. In the transition area, gas and liquid can be 
dissolved into each other, and a pseudo-boiling phenomenon occurs. 
Trans/supercritical  effects  need  to  be  considered  in  spray  models. 
Alternatively,  simulating  a  spray  with  the  Euler  method  viewing 
spray as a continuous phase can precisely predict the interface shape 
and eliminate errors [222]. Finally, simulating the interfacial process 
and the subsequent combustion by molecular dynamics is a feasible 
way [212,215] for understanding the detailed mechanism of super-
critical spray combustion. 
4)  The  influence  of  turbulence  on  supercritical  spray  needs  to  be 
clarified. Importantly, a systematic study is necessary to assess the 
capability  of  the  current  turbulence  models  for  the  supercritical 
spray process. 

4.2. Turbulent spray flames in dual-fuel engines 

Most  studies  on  turbulent  spray  flames  were  performed  under 
ambient  air  conditions.  However,  in  dual-fuel  engines,  a  pilot  diesel 
igniter  is  generally  used  to  trigger  the  ignition  of  the  methane–air 
mixture. Several studies [223-226] have investigated fuel injection into 
a methane–air mixture ambient. In general, the addition of methane to 
the  ambient  mixture  prolonged  the  autoignition  of  n-heptane  spray 
[223],  and  both  the  pre-ignition  and  post-ignition  processes  were 
affected  in  a  complex  manner  depending  on  the  initial  methane  con-
centration and boundary conditions [227]. However, it is noteworthy 
that the pre-ignition oxidative reactions of the premixed methane–air 
mixture  before  the  injection  of  n-heptane  will  induce  an  increase  in 
ambient temperature and produce intermediate radicals, which finally 
promote n-heptane ignition [226]. Furthermore, the two-stage ignition 
process in turbulent spray flame under dual-fuel engine-like conditions, 
in which DME was injected into a methane–air mixture [137,138], was 
investigated. In these studies, a reduced DME/CH4  oxidization mecha-
nism with 25 species and 147 elementary reactions was incorporated. 
Low-temperature autoignition is found to be initialized in the fuel-rich 
region,  and  then  a  cool  flame  was  formed,  propagating  toward  the 
even richer mixture through a balanced reaction–diffusion mechanism. 
The  cool  flame  facilitated  the  formation  of  high-temperature  kernels, 
which eventually triggered the premixed methane–air mixture. During 
the  process,  triple  or  tetrabranchial  flames,  including  cool  flame, 
fuel-rich-premixed  flame,  diffusion  flame,  and  fuel-lean-premixed 
flame,  coexist  in  the  field.  The  effects  of  methane  on  the  first-  and 
second-stage ignition processes were also studied by Srna et al. [228] 
and  Kahila  et  al.  [14,16,229]  both  experimentally  and  numerically. 
Methane was found to delay both the first and second stage of ignition, 
and it mostly deferred the cool-flame reactivity. Many active interme-
diate species, such as OH and O, were consumed by CH4, thus prolonging 
the  early  decomposition  of  n-dodecane.  The  first  detection  of  CH2O 
showed a small dependence on the methane concentration [228]. The 
deferring  effect  of  LTI  from  methane  plays  the  dominant  role  in  pro-
longing the HTC of spray flames. Further work is required to establish 
the  controlling  mechanisms  behind  the  highly  complex  multiscale 
multiphysics process to achieve optimal engine performance and reduce 
emissions. Finally, turbulence–spray–combustion interactions involving 
the  effects  of  fuel-stratified  methane–air  as  well  as  temperature  and 
species  inhomogeneity  effects  on  the  ignition  process  in  dual-fuel 
engine-like conditions should be further considered. 

4.3. Turbulent spray flames of real fuels 

It 

in 

is  currently 

this  review. 

Advanced  compression-ignition  combustion  strategies 

include 
higher pressures, lower temperatures, varying degrees of fuel–air pre-
mixing, high levels of EGR, and multiple fuel-injection events [9]. Most 
studies on diesel combustion typically adopted single-component fuels 
(n-heptane  and  dodecane)  as  surrogates  to  simulate  the  combustion 
process of using advanced combustion strategies, such as those afore-
mentioned 
for  a 
single-component fuel to represent all aspects of fuel behaviors in diesel 
engines. However, there are some basic conclusions and methods that 
are independent of the fuels, such as the mechanisms of TCI and radi-
ation effects on the key aspects, i.e., the autoignition process and flame 
LOL or diffusion flame stabilization in diesel spray combustion discussed 
in  the  review.  In  addition,  numerical  model  validation  requires 
well-defined  experimental  conditions  with  an  open-access  data  re-
pository 
the  existing  studies  using 
single-component  fuels  can  be  used  as  references  to  understand  the 
autoignition, flame development and flame stabilization mechanisms of 
real fuels under diesel-like conditions. 

for  spray  flames.  Thus, 

impossible 

Currently, little is known about the spray combustion behaviors of 
real fuels over a wide range of thermophysical conditions. Studies on the 
combustion of real fuels with all the hydrocarbon species included are 
highly unrealistic considering  the limitations of the  present computa-
tional and experimental facilities [230]. Conventional engine fuels are 
complex  hydrocarbon  mixtures,  including  hundreds  to  thousands  of 
chemical compounds, which have different thermophysical properties, 
such  as  vapor  diffusivity,  viscosity,  density,  vapor  pressure,  surface 
tension, and chemical kinetics [231-233]. Therefore, high-efficiency and 
high-fidelity surrogates of real diesel fuels simultaneously considering 
both physical and chemical aspects should be established to reproduce 
key  real  fuel  characteristics.  These  are  important  particularly  for  the 
development  of  multicomponent  vaporization  models  and  chemical 
mechanisms  of  real  engine  fuels  using  advanced  methods  [233,234], 
such as the physical surrogate group chemistry representation (PSGCR) 
method  [230],  decoupling  physical-chemical  surrogate  (DPCS)  model 
[231,235] and the hybrid chemistry (HyChem) approach [232,233]. 

In the PSGCR method, the components in the physical surrogate and 
chemical  surrogate  are  essentially  the  same;  thus,  the  physical  and 
chemical  submodels  can  be  directly  coupled.  However,  it  is  probably 
impossible  to  fully  couple  the  physical  properties  with  the  chemical 
properties  of  actual  fuels  with  complicated  compositions  at  present 
[236]. The breakup and evaporation of the spray in diesel engines are 
critical  to  the  subsequent  combustion  process.  The  DPCS  model  was 
proposed to investigate the spray and combustion characteristics of real 
fuels [231,235], where the discrete multi-component model was intro-
duced to describe the physical properties  based on the  major compo-
nents  of  real  fuels.  The  skeletal  chemical  mechanism  of  the  chemical 
surrogate is employed to reproduce the chemical behavior of real fuels. 
The DPCS model was applied to predict the spray penetration of soybean 
methyl ester (SME) as well as the combustion and emissions of a PCCI 
engine  fueled  with  SME,  in  which  methyl  decanoate,  methyl  5-dece-
noate, and n-decane (C10H22) were included in the chemical surrogate. 
The results showed that the DPCS model reproduces spray penetration, 
indicated  specific  fuel  consumption  and  emissions  better  than 
single-component model. 

Recently,  a  HyChem  method  has  been  developed  for real  jet  fuels 
[232,233]. This method combines experimental constraints, a lumped 
pyrolysis model for fuel decomposition and a detailed kinetic model for 
oxidative  pyrolysis of  the  oxidation of  the decomposition products  to 
accurately describe the combustion process over a wide range of ther-
modynamic conditions. Based on the HyChem method, a LES study of 
turbulent spray combustion fueled with Jet-A considering the real fuel 
chemistry was carried out for an aeronautical combustion chamber. It 
was difficult to solve the real fuel mechanism directly, so an analytically 
reduced  chemistry  was  introduced.  Compared  with  the  experimental 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience86(2021)10093925L. Zhou et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

data, an LES results could accurately reproduce the gas velocity, tem-
perature and species mass fractions, especially for the NOx levels [237]. 
With detailed chemical kinetics of real fuel surrogates being used in 
turbulent  spray  combustion  simulations,  the  computational  cost  will 
become excessive because of the large number of chemical species and 
reactions and the wide range of chemical timescales involved. There-
fore, accelerating methods, such as dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) 
[238-241],  dimension  reduction  [242],  cell  agglomeration  methods 
[243,244], and TDAC [245] should be suitably utilized to resolve this 
issue without compromising the prediction accuracy. However, similar 
to the most stand-alone accelerating methods, once these methods are 
employed, they will cover the entire simulation without considering the 
different combustion stages with different chemistry reaction features, 
such  as  LTC  stage  and  autoignition  process.  This  limits  the  computa-
tional efficiency of the accelerating methods. To address this limitation, 
recently  proposed  methods,  such  as  the  static  adaptive  chemistry  ac-
celeration  approach  [246,247]  and  dynamic  adaptive  acceleration 
method  (DAAM)  [248],  aim  to  achieve  high-efficiency  computation 
under  complex  thermodynamic  conditions  in  engine  combustion 
chambers. At a given reaction fractional step, the DAAM dynamically 
selects  the  optimal  acceleration  method  for  each  computational  cell 
based on the encountered composition inhomogeneity, which is quan-
tified  through  reconstructing  the  histogram  in  a  low-dimensional 
composition subspace determined by the principal component analysis 
[249]. 

Overall, an in-depth study of the turbulent spray flame of real fuels 
under diesel-like conditions is very rare currently. Thus, for future work, 
more  well-designed  experiments  should  be  conducted  and  a  high- 
fidelity  real  fuel  surrogate  model  that  simultaneously  considers  both 
physical and chemical aspects should be developed. In the spray process, 
the surrogate should closely match the actual distillation curve and fuel 
vapor mixture, and in the combustion process, the combustion behavior 
of the real fuel should be matched over a wide range of thermodynamic 
conditions. 

5. Conclusions and outlook 

5.1. Concluding remarks 

Fuel sprays play a critical role in liquid-fuel combustion and are very 
effective for controlling the combustion process and consequently the 
performance of engines. Therefore, studies on turbulent spray flames are 
comprehensively  discussed  in  terms  of  the  turbulence-chemistry, 
spray–turbulence,  and  spray–chemistry  interactions  at  elevated  pres-
sures and temperatures. Significant progress has been made in under-
standing the spray–chemistry–turbulence interaction over the past few 
decades. 

In the context of spray-turbulence interaction, the dynamics of high- 
speed spray promote turbulence generation in the flow field, which in 
turn  affects  the  cavitation,  primary  and  secondary  spray  breakup, 
droplet evaporation, and mixing via momentum exchange. Considering 
the turbulent fluctuation effects can lead to more accurate predictions of 
the  liquid penetration and distribution of fuel vapor. For the ignition 
process,  the  relative  timescales  of  droplet  evaporation,  convection, 
molecular  diffusion  gas,  chemistry,  and  temperature  determine  the 
ignition  modes.  For  the  two-stage  ignition  process,  a  cool  flame  can 
occur  in  the  fuel-lean  region  first  at  a  low  temperature  owing  to  the 
evaporation of cold fuel; then, the second-stage ignition moves toward 
the fuel-rich region. The stabilization mechanism of the spray flame can 
be scrutinized through the budget analysis. Most studies have found that 
the reaction terms are larger than the diffusion terms near the flame LOL 
positions under various pressures and temperatures. This implies that 
the flame stabilization is dominated by autoignition, and the turbulent 
transport of heat also makes a certain contribution to the flame stabili-
zation. Various phenomena occur, including LTC with cool flames, high- 
temperature  flames,  and  diffusion  flames,  which  interact  with 

turbulence. 

For turbulent spray combustion, incorporation of TCI effects yields 
improved  predictions  of  ID,  flame  LOL,  distributions  of  temperature, 
species,  and  soot  production,  especially  at  low  temperatures  and  low 
oxygen concentrations. Neglecting the TCI can overpredict the ID and 
result  in  a  thin  flame  structure  with  a  considerably  high  local  peak 
temperature and heat release rate. Furthermore, the TRI effect on the 
spray flame is found to be less than 10%, as predicted by the transport 
PDF  approach  coupled  with  three  different  radiative  transfer  solvers, 
which is smaller than the TCI effect. In addition to the TCI effect, fuel 
chemistry  strongly  influences  the  ignition  process,  and  the  predictive 
capabilities  are  significantly  enhanced  by  the  inclusion  of  low- 
temperature chemistry. Overall, the accuracy and usefulness of turbu-
lent spray flame simulations under engine-like conditions are limited by 
availability  of  accurate  and  reliable  chemical  mechanisms  for  multi-
component  fuels,  radiation  treatment,  turbulence  models,  flow  and 
physiochemical properties under supercritical conditions, and near-wall 
models.  Comparable  experimental  data  are  badly  needed  for  model 
development and validation. It is also important to perform systematic 
uncertainty  quantification  analysis  in  order  to  use  simulation  results 
judicially. 

5.2. Future research directions 

Over the past decade, great progress has been made in understanding 
the underlying mechanisms of turbulent spray flames. However, there 
are  still  many  unsolved  issues  that  requires  further  investigation,  as 
discussed below. 

Turbulent spray flames: Efforts to understand the complex process 
of  turbulent  spray  flames  have  been  made  both  experimentally  and 
numerically. However, there is a lack of quantitative optical diagnostics 
for turbulence–spray–combustion  interactions. Future work  should be 
focused on developing advanced optical diagnostics to detect interme-
diate  species  under  low  to  medium  temperature  conditions  to  study 
ignition and combustion involving cool flames and ignition/extinction, 
among others. Regarding numerical simulations, a high priority should 
be given to the development of spray breakup models and atomization 
models  of  multicomponent  fuels.  In  the  spray  process,  the  KH–RT 
breakup model is widely utilized to describe the primary and secondary 
breakup processes. However, the model requires further assessment and 
development for ultra-high injection pressures (> 300 MPa), which will 
affect  the  prediction  of  highly  relevant  velocity  or  shock  waves  on 
droplet  breakup  [250].  Meanwhile,  accurate  and  reliable  models  are 
necessary to account for the effects of cavitation and turbulence on the 
breakup process in the dense spray regime. 

Turbulent  spray  FWI:  It  is  important  to  understand  the  spray 
flame–wall–turbulence  interactions  to  improve  engine  performance. 
Further  research  should  be  focused  on  these  superordinate  topics:  1) 
effect of turbulence on the spray  FWI, 2) mechanisms of liquid spray 
ignition  by  hot  surface,  and  3)  effects  of  near-wall  multiphase  flow/ 
turbulence/combustion  models  on  the  numerical  prediction  of  spray 
flame structures.
