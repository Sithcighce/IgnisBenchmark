Electrochemical energy systems, such as batteries and fuel cells, are being developed for applications
ranging from portable devices and electric vehicles to large-scale grid storage. These advanced energy
conversion and storage technologies will be a critical aspect of a sustainable energy future and promise
to provide cleaner, more efficient energy. Computational modeling at various scales from nanoscale ab
initio modeling to macroscale system and controls level modeling, has been a central part of the electro-
chemical energy research. Much of the complex interactions due to the electrochemistry coupled trans-
port phenomena occur at the interfaces and within the porous electrode microstructures. This is often
referred to as the mesoscale and plays a critical role in the operation and efficiency of electrochemi-
cal devices. In this critical perspective, we discuss the state-of-the-art, challenges and path forward in
mesoscale modeling of electrochemical energy systems and their application to various design and op-
erational issues in solid oxide fuel cells, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, lithium ion batteries
and metal-air batteries. Particular focus is given to particle-based methods and fine-scale computational
fluid dynamics based direct numerical simulation techniques, along with the challenges and advantages
of these methods. Notable results from mesoscale modeling are presented along with discussions of the
advantages, disadvantages and challenges facing mesoscale model development. This in-depth perspective
is envisioned to serve as a primer to the critical role mesoscale modeling is poised to play in advancing
the science and engineering of electrochemical energy systems.

1. Introduction

The  development  of  advanced  electrochemical  energy  storage
and conversion devices is critical to the development of a sustain-
able energy future. Electrochemical devices provide cleaner, more
efficient  energy  than  traditional  fossil  fuel  burning  systems  and
have the potential to significantly change the energy profile of the
United States and the world. With the increasing use of intermit-
tent, renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, reliable en-
ergy storage is needed. Additionally, more efficient, longer lasting
electrochemical devices are needed to increase the acceptance of
alternative fuel vehicles, such as plugin hybrid, fuel cell, and bat-
tery electric vehicles.

Electrochemical  storage  and  conversion  devices  cover  a  wide
array of technologies such as batteries, fuel cells and capacitors.
These technologies all operate along common physical principles
but have distinct differences in their underlying multi-physical in-
teractions and operational window. For example, solid oxide fuel
cells (SOFCs) operate at high temperatures (60 0–10 0 0 °C) and in-
volve  the  transport  of  gaseous  species  through  porous  ceramic-
based media; while, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PE-
FCs) operate at lower temperatures ( < 100 °C) and involve multi-
phase transport through multiple materials and layers.

Research into electrochemical devices has been ongoing for al-
most a century and has resulted in significant advances in technol-
ogy. This research has involved a combination of both experimen-
tal and computational studies of the design, operation, safety, and
performance of electrochemical devices. The complex microstruc-
tures and multi-physics of electrochemical devices require research
to consider these devices at multiple scales and with a variety of
experimental and computational tools. Computational modeling is
particularly well suited for studying these systems given its ability
to resolve the detailed physics occurring within them during oper-
ation, which cannot be observed experimentally.

Much of the critical physics of electrochemical devices occurs
within the porous media of the device and at the interfaces be-
tween  the  electrodes  and  electrolyte.  The  physics  occurring  in
these regions are considered mesoscale phenomena and typically
take  place  on  the  micron  to  millimeter  length  scale.  Mesoscale
is  the  length  and  time  scales  between  the  nano-scale  reactions
and  transport  happening  on  the  surfaces  of  materials  and  the
macroscale operation of the electrochemical devices. The majority
of the chemical and electrochemical reactions, temperature varia-
tions and stresses in electrochemical devices occur in the regions
around the electrode-electrolyte interfaces of the cell and degra-
dation  of  the  electrochemical  performance  and  structural  stabil-
ity  often  occurs  in  these  regions.  This  makes  understanding  the
mesoscale phenomena critical to the design of advanced electro-
chemical devices.

Computational studies of multiphase systems often occur at the
two extremes of the system. Namely, the atomic level first prin-
ciples scale or large-scale device modeling. While understanding
the  system  at  both  of  these  scales  is  critical,  it  is  not  sufficient
for understanding the physics or for designing new systems. While
atomic level modeling can elucidate the reactions and surface in-
teractions of the system, it cannot be scaled up to a level where
the transport near the interface or in complicated multiphase ge-
ometries is resolved. At the other end, large-scale simulations are
often used to study the overall performance of an electrochemi-
cal device, such as a battery, where the porous materials within
the  device  are  considered  using  a  macrohomogeneous  modeling
approach,  which  homogenizes  the  porous  media  and  character-
izes  it  via  bulk  effective  parameters  without  explicitly  resolving
the  interfacial  physics.  In  heterogeneous  reactive  systems,  it  has
been shown that the accurate modeling of the transport through
the structure is critical to accurately predicting the overall perfor-
mance, this is especially critical in electrochemical devices. To ac-
complish this  mesoscale modeling is  needed that  can  accurately
resolve the microstructure and the reactive transport within it.

In this article, we will review mesoscale computational mod-
eling of electrochemical devices. The review will discuss the mul-
tiphysics phenomena at the mesoscale along with computational
modeling methods used to consider electrochemical devices. The
application of mesoscale modeling to various electrochemical de-
vices will also be presented and will focus on fuel cell (SOFCs and
PEFCs) and battery (lithium-ion, lithium-air) technologies. Specific
examples of the use of mesoscale computational models to inves-
tigate the performance, stability and design of fuel cells and bat-
teries will be presented along with a discussion of challenges and
future perspectives for mesoscale modeling of electrochemical sys-
tems.

2. Electrochemical physics

Electrochemical  devices  are  inherently  multiphysics  systems,
their performance is driven by the numerous physical phenomena
occurring within them and the interactions and coupling between
the  different  physics.  These  phenomena include  the  transport  of
charge  and  species,  chemical  and  electrochemical  reactions,  and
heat transfer. Mesoscale computational models need to accurately
include these physics in their models to predict the performance
and operation of the device. Additionally, mesoscale models that
resolve the pore-scale phenomena can be used to formulate effec-
tive property models which are used in macrohomogeneous mod-
eling methods. In the following sub-sections, the mesoscale gov-
erning  equations  for  the  multiphysics  of  electrochemical  devices
are discussed. It should be noted that the length scales considered
to be mesoscale in this article are large enough that the continuum

governing equations are valid, as such the equations discussed in
the following sub-sections are often very similar to the governing
equations used in macroscale modeling.

2.1. Electrochemistry and chemical reactions

Electrochemical  reactions  are  the  heart  of  an  electrochemical
device’s operation. Depending on the system of interest the elec-
trochemical reactions can take a variety of forms. In general, an ox-
idation reaction will occur in one electrode releasing electrons and
a reduction reaction will occur in the other electrode consuming
the electrons. For high temperature SOFCs the typical global elec-
trochemical reaction for the anode and cathode can be written as
an oxidation reaction of H
H 2 ( f ) + O 2 −(e ) ↔ H 2 O ( f ) + 2 e
where  subscript  f  denotes  species  in  the  fluid  phase,  s  in  the
electrode  phase  and  e  in  the  electrolyte  phase,  and  a  reduction
reaction of O

The  chemical  reactions  can  be  modeled  as  a  source  term  ( S )

where  c  is  the  concentration,  (cid:2) u  is  the  velocity  vector,  J  is  the
diffusive  flux,  and  S  is  summed  over  all  reactions  ( R )  involving
species i . Treatment of electrochemical reactions occurring at the
electrode-electrolyte  interface  can  be  done  in  two  ways.  For  a
homogenized representation of the electrode-electrolyte assembly,
the  interfacial  electrochemical  reactions  can  be  modeled  as  the
source  term  ( S )  while  for  the  fine  scale  modeling  on  the  com-
pletely resolved electrode microstructure, the interfacial reactions
occur  as  interface  conditions  and  boundary  conditions  for  the
governing differential equation. The aforementioned distinction is
detailed  in  Section  2.5  using  the  intercalation-based  lithium-ion
battery (LIB) system as an example with appropriate governing dif-
ferential equations and boundary/interface conditions.

In  general,  the  reaction  rates  are  mathematically  related  to
species  concentrations  via  the  law  of  mass  action,  as  shown  in
Eq. (4) . Here, a distinction should be made that chemical reactions
are typically homogeneous reaction, i.e., reactants and species are
in the same phase and thus these are volumetric (bulk) reactions.
On the other hand, the electrochemical reactions are, by their very
nature,  heterogeneous  reactions  and  take  place  at  an  electrified
interface. Atomistically speaking, electrochemical reactions are es-
sentially made up of two distinct finite rate processes: (i) adsorp-
tion of bulk species at the interface, and (ii) subsequent reaction
of adsorbed species. Depending on the chemical species involved,
both reactants as well as products could be the adsorbed species.
Generally, it is assumed that the adsorption of bulk species is a
much faster process as compared to the electrochemical reaction
step and in-turn the concentrations appearing in an electrochemi-
cal rate equation such as Eq. (4) are bulk concentrations while the
reaction rate itself is an interfacial reaction rate (expressed in the
units of mol/m 2 s). Generally, the species concentration exponents
are stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced reaction. However, if
the balanced reaction is composed of multiple simpler steps, then,
effective  coefficients  would  differ  from  the  stoichiometric  coeffi-
cients in the overall balance equation [1] .

spect to species j . The reaction rate coefficients (both forward and
reverse)  relate  to  the  energy  barriers  for  the  respective  reaction
halves and temperature in an Arrhenius fashion. For a typical ther-
mally triggered reaction, energy barriers are related to the differ-
ence in energies between the metastable activated complex and re-
actant/product states. This mathematical form is shown in Eq. (5) .
For electrochemical reactions, the change in electrostatic potential
jump across the electrified interface provides a means to alter the
effective ener gy barriers as further shown in Eqs. (7,8 ) [1] .
k (T ) = k o e
where k o is the pre-exponential factor, E A is the activation energy
of the reaction and R is the universal gas constant. Determining the
reaction rate coefficients is often a challenge to modeling reactions,
especially in electrochemical devices where multiple reaction steps
and pathways exist. It is customary to describe electrochemical re-
actions in the form of current, rather than a molar rate, given the
simplicity  of  current  measurements.  Thus,  the  molar  rate  as  ex-
pressed in Eq. (4) is equivalent to an electrochemical current as
shown in Eq. (6) [2] . The current associated with electrochemical
reactions is also known as the Faradaic current (in contrast to the
capacitive current associated with charge accumulation in a double
layer) [3] .

scribed  before, F  is  Faraday’s  constant,  n  is  the  number  of  elec-
trons. Depending on the participating species, the concentrations
that  contribute  to  the  charge-transfer rate  can  be  surface  cover-
age, gas-phase compositions, or bulk-phase ion concentrations. The
charge transfer reaction rates are defined as, [3]

where  ηA  is  the  electrostatic  potential  difference,  and  αs  is  the
electrode  transfer  coefficient.  The  jump  in  electrostatic  poten-
tials across the electrified interface do not necessarily contribute
equally  to  both  the  forward  and  backward  reactions.  The  asym-
metry of this potential contribution is characterized by the charge
transfer  coefficient  αs  which  in  the  limits  of  αs = 0.5  provides
equal contributions to both the halves. αs → 1 favors the backward
reaction while αs → 0 favors the forward reaction.

It should be noted that the above discussion has been for ele-
mentary  (i.e.  single-electron  charge  transfer  reactions)  for  which
the  charge  transfer  coefficients  (symmetry  factors)  sum  up  to
be  unity.  For  multi-electron  charge  transfer  reactions,  the  effec-
tive anodic and cathodic symmetry factors can vary greatly from
elementary-reaction formulation. If the multiple electron transfer
reaction mechanism can be broken down into multiple steps for
single-electron transfer, kinetic parameters can still be determined,
albeit with higher complications [4] .

The current density is an implicit measure of the rate of elec-
trochemical reactions since electrons are released through the elec-
trochemical reactions. The Butler–Volmer equation, which can be
derived independently from the theory of activated complexes as
well as Marcus kinetics, is expressed as, [2,4–8]
(cid:9)(cid:11)

where i o is the exchange current density and ηA is the activation

( i ) and the activation polarization ( ηA ) is nonlinear and implicit,
which does not allow for an explicit calculation of the activation
polarization from the current density. Simplified expressions can
be written for cases with high or low current density, such as the
Tafel equation of the high current regime [9] .

The Butler–Volmer relation can be used to calculate the local
conditions within an electrochemical device by using a mesoscale
electrochemistry approach [10,11] . The local Faradaic current den-
sity can be calculated from a local, modified Butler–Volmer rela-
tion as, [12]

where i o,e is the local exchange current density and ηA is the lo-

culated as,
ηA ( (cid:2) x ) = φs ( (cid:2) x ) − φe ( (cid:2) x ) − U s,eq ( (cid:2) x )
(11)
where φs is the local potential of the electrode, φe is the local elec-
trolyte potential and U s , eq is the local equilibrium potential of the
electrode, which can be calculated using the Nernst equation with
the local partial pressures of the gas.

Both the explicit formulation ( Eq. (6) ) for the current density
and the implicit formulation ( Eq. (10) ) are used in mesoscale mod-
eling of electrochemical devices.

2.2. Charge transport

Charge transport in porous electrodes describes ionic transport
in the electrolyte through the pore space. For example, in a typi-
cal LIB electrode, Li + ion transport in an inorganic electrolyte con-
sisting of LiPF
6 salt and carbonate solvent, needs to be considered.
A canonical representation of charge transport includes ionic con-
centration, C
i ,
i , and charge number, z
i = z
i (where F is Faraday’s constant). Correspondingly, ionic
i.e. q
flux based on the Nernst-Planck equation, can be expressed within
the volume averaged porous medium representation as:
ε
τ C i ∇ φe + C i u

ε
∇ C i − z i F B i
N i = −D i
τ
i is the diffusion coefficient for the ion, ε is porosity, and
where D
τ is tortuosity. The presence of a porosity/tortuosity ratio ( ε/ τ ) ac-
counts for the transport resistance due to the porous network tor-
tuosity. u is a bulk (superficial) volume averaged velocity vector,
which is often computed via Darcy’s law for the volume averaged
porous medium representation or else via the momentum conser-
vation equation in a mesoscale representation. As discussed later
in this review, mesoscale modeling is used to determine values of
porosity and tortuosity within microstructures for use in Eq. (12) ;
additionally  Eq.  (12)  can  be  reformulated  as  a  pore-scale  model
where  the  microstructure  is  explicitly  resolved  and  the  porosity
and tortuosity do not need to be included.

(12)

The  Nernst–Planck  expression  ( Eq.  (12) )  represents  ionic  flux
due  to  three  mechanisms:  (i)  diffusion  due  to  a  concentration
gradient  ∇C
i ;  (ii)  migration  due  to  the  electric  potential  gradi-
ent ∇φe ; and (iii) advection due to the solvent velocity field u .
i is ionic mobility and is related to ionic diffusivity via the

i / RT ( R is universal gas constant and
T is temperature). Using this flux description ( Eq. (12) ), the gov-
erning differential equation for ionic species transport in porous
electrodes (volume-averaged) takes the form,

where  φs  is  the  electric  potential  in  the  solid  phase,  and  σ eff
is  the  effective  electronic  conductivity  of  the  solid  phase,  which
is determined from mesoscale models of the microstructure. The
electric  potentials,  φs  and  φe ,  define  the  overpotential  driv-
ing  the  electrochemical  reactions  at  the  electrochemically  active
(solid/electrolyte)  interface.  Note  that  if  the  porous  medium  is
electronically insulating (e.g., a separator in LIBs), the solid phase
potential equation is not required to be solved.

In summary, charge transport in a typical porous electrode re-
quires a set of four governing equations: (1) species balance for
charged species Eq. (13) ); ( (2) momentum equation for the solu-
tion  phase  (e.g.,  Darcy’s  law  to  obtain  volume-averaged  velocity
field u ; the effect of advection may be neglected in a typical LIB
electrode.); (3) charge conservation in the solution phase Eq. (14) );
and ( (4) charge conservation in the solid phase ( Eq. (17) ). The solu-
tion of this set of coupled governing differential equations requires
appropriate boundary and initial conditions.

2.3. Advection-diffusion-migration

The transport of species is central to the operation of electro-
chemical devices and includes the transport of reactants and prod-
ucts to/from the reaction sites. The transport of species can be di-
vided into advective and diffusive transport. Advection is transport
due to the bulk motion of a fluid; while diffusion is transport due
to the random motion of molecules in a system. The transport of
species can be described by the advection-diffusion equation,
∂ c i

ity and J
pled  to  the  electrochemistry  via  a  source  term  as  discussed  in
Section 2.1 and Eq. (3) .

Under  certain  conditions,  advection  or  diffusion  can  be  ne-
glected  without  affecting  the  overall  transport  of  species  in  the
system, which allows for a simpler transport model. The relative

122

significance of advection and diffusion is determined by the Peclet
number,

P e =

Lu
D

(19)

where L is the characteristic length of the system, u is the magni-
tude of the velocity and D is the diffusion coefficient [13] . When
Pe (cid:6) 1 advection is the dominate transport mechanism and diffu-
sion may be neglected; while if Pe (cid:7) 1 diffusion is dominate and
advection may be neglected. Both advection and diffusion are sig-
nificant when Pe ∼ 1 , in which case the full advection-diffusion
equation should be solved.

Advection occurs when species are carried by the bulk flow of
a fluid and is calculated from the velocity as shown in the second
term on the left-hand side of Eq. (18) . When advection is signifi-
cant, the momentum conservation equation must be solved in ad-
dition to Eq. (18) ,

ρ

∂ (cid:2) u
∂t

+ ρ (cid:2) u · ∇ (cid:2) u = −∇P + ∇ · (μ∇ (cid:2) u ) + F ext

(20)

where ρ is density, P is pressure, μ is viscosity and F ext is any ex-
ternal forces such as gravity. The importance of advection to the
operation of an electrochemical system must be considered on a
case  by  case  basis.  In  many  multiphase  electrodes,  transport  is
dominated by diffusion and as such the advection within the elec-
trode can be neglected. For instance in SOFCs, studies have shown
that the effects of advection in the fuel and oxidant channels ad-
jacent to the electrodes do not penetrate into the electrodes and
transport  can  be  assumed  to  be  driven  by  diffusion  within  the
electrodes [14] . However, in the fuel and oxidant channels above
the  electrodes  advection  is  the  dominant  transport  mechanism.
Similarly in PEFCs, advection effects are critical to enhancing mass
transport using an interdigitated channel design for the fuel and
oxidant [15] . Additionally, in some electrochemical systems, advec-
tion is central to the system’s operation, such as in flow batteries
where the flow of electrolyte drives the power output of the bat-
tery.

The diffusive flux ( J ), which is the term on the right hand side
of  Eq.  (18) ,  is  driven  by  the  concentration  gradients  within  the
electrochemical device and is often a more difficult problem to for-
mulate then advection. In many devices the electrodes are com-
plex porous media. Diffusive transport within porous media can be
a combination of molecular diffusion, Knudsen diffusion and sur-
face diffusion. Molecular diffusion is the bulk diffusion of the fluid,
which is due to the interactions of fluid molecules with other fluid
molecules. Knudsen diffusion occurs in small pores where the pore
radius is on the order of the mean free path of the fluid. Surface
diffusion occurs when species that are adsorbed to the surface of
the porous medium are mobile on the surface.

For molecular diffusion, the diffusive flux ( J ) is typically mod-

eled as Fickian diffusion,
J i = −D i j ∇ c i

(21)

where D
ij  is the binary diffusion coefficient, which can be found
from  experimental  data  or  calculated  from  theoretical  and  em-
pirical relations [16] . Eq. (21) is formulated for a binary system,
in systems with more than two species multi-component molec-
ular diffusion occurs  in which the effects of all species’ interac-
tions on diffusion must be accounted for. Under dilute conditions
the system can be approximated as a binary system and can be
modeled as Fickian diffusion [16] . In non-dilute cases, the Stefan-
Maxwell equation can be used to describe multi-component diffu-
sion [17,18] ,
n (cid:2)

j=1
j(cid:9) = i

where c T is the total molar concentration of the mixture and N
i is
the molar flux of species i relative to a stationary coordinate sys-
tem.

In  porous  media,  Knudsen  diffusion  can  also  be  a  significant
transport mechanism. Knudsen diffusion occurs when the interac-
tions of molecules with the pore walls become more frequent then
the interactions of molecules with other fluid molecules. Knudsen
diffusion is typically formulated as Fickian diffusion ( Eq. (21) ) with
the Knudsen diffusion coefficient used in place of the binary dif-
fusion coefficient. The Knudsen diffusion coefficient of a species is
independent of the other species in the system and is derived from
the molecular motion of the molecules and the geometry of the
pores [16,19,20] ,

(23)

for a circular pore where d is the diameter of the pore, R is the uni-
versal gas constant and M
i is the molar mass of the gas species. In
real porous media, such as the electrodes, the pore walls are rough
and can have fractal internal surfaces which lead to more compli-
cated formulations for the Knudsen diffusion coefficient [20] . Due
to the difficulty in determining the diffusion coefficient in real pore
geometries, ideal geometries such as spheres and cylinders are of-
ten used [19] .

The significance of Knudsen diffusion is determined from the
mean free path of the fluid and the pore diameter of the porous
media. In a porous media with very small pores, Knudsen diffu-
sion will dominate diffusive transport; while in systems with large
pores, molecular diffusion will dominate. A transition region occurs
in porous media with intermediate pore sizes where both Knudsen
and molecular diffusion are significant.

In  mesoscale  computational  models,  the  inclusion  of  both
Knudsen and molecular diffusion can be a difficult task. Mesoscale
models typically resolve the porous microstructure and depending
on the size of a specific pore either Knudsen or molecular diffu-
sion may be significant. In non-ideal systems it can be difficult to
define individual pores and the appropriate pore diameter for each
pore. Fig. 1 shows example microstructures seen in various electro-
chemical devices; the heterogeneity of the microstructure makes
the  identification  of  individual  pores  difficult.  Often  an  effective
diffusion  coefficient  is  used  to  describe  the  combined  effects  of
molecular and Knudsen diffusion or molecular diffusion is assumed
to dominate the diffusive transport.

In addition to gas diffusion, surface diffusion may also be sig-
nificant in electrochemical devices. Surface diffusion describes the
mobility of molecules that are adsorbed to a surface. Surface diffu-
sion can occur in systems with both physisorbed and chemisorbed
species.  When  a  species  is  physisorbed  to  a  surface  its  adsorp-
tion energy is less than k B T and the species are highly mobile. In
chemisorption,  where  the  adsorption  energy  is  greater  than  k B T ,
the species are more tightly bound to the surface and have less
mobility but may still move by hopping from adsorption site to ad-
sorption site on the surface [16] . Surface diffusion depends strongly
on  the  temperature  and  surface  conditions  of  the  system.  High
temperatures, such as those found in SOFCs, have been shown to
accelerate surface diffusion. Surface diffusion also increases with
increasing surface concentrations; while different faces of a mate-
rial can have drastically different surface diffusion rates [24] . Most
surface  diffusion  models  use  the  Fickian  formulation  ( Eq.  (21) )
with a diffusion coefficient that is typically found through exper-
imental measurements [25,26] . The surface diffusion coefficient is
typically on the order of 10 −5 cm 2 /s but can vary widely for dif-
ferent materials and at different temperatures [16] .

2.4. Heat transfer

Heat generation and thermal transport are extremely important
for safe and optimal operation for electrochemical devices, includ-
ing LIBs and PEFCs [27–29] . For example, non-uniform distribution
and local excursion of temperature in the LIB is a safety concern
for electric drive vehicles [27] . A generalized energy conservation
equation for temperature distribution in a typical electrochemical
device electrode can be expressed as [30–32] ,

where T is the temperature, q is the volumetric heat generation
rate, and ρ, c p , and λ are density, specific heat, and heat conduc-
tivity, respectively, for each constituent phase, k . It is important to
note that a typical electrode consists of multiple phases, for ex-
ample the LIB electrode includes active material, conductive addi-
tive, binder and electrolyte. The thermophysical properties can be
anisotropic due to the inhomogeneity of battery components. The
convection due to electrolyte flow in the electrode is typically neg-
ligible and thermal conduction is the primary mode of heat trans-
fer inside the cell.

The heat generation rate depends on the thermodynamic prop-
erties of the reactions proceeding in a cell, the potential-current
characteristics of the cell, and the rates of charge and discharge. By
utilizing the first law of thermodynamics for an isobaric battery sy-
stem, Bernardi et al. [33] presented a general energy balance equa-
tion for a cell in which the rate of heat generation was given by:

(cid:7)

(25)

The first term on the right hand side of Eq. (25) represents the
heat generated due to the enthalpy of the charge transfer reactions,
the second term is the electrical work done by the battery. The
first term is generalized for the n th reaction since an electrode also
typically includes other side reactions leading to heat generation.
I n  is the partial reaction current contribution from the n th elec-
trode reaction, U n is the corresponding open circuit potential, I is
the apparent current density and V the cell potential. The enthalpy
of mixing term represents the heat effect associated with concen-
tration gradients in the cell and the last term represents heat effect
due  to  phase  transformations.  The  electrochemical-thermal  cou-
pling manifests in terms of temperature-dependent physicochem-
ical properties (e.g. diffusion coefficient and ionic conductivity of
the electrolyte) and dependence of the open circuit potential with
local concentrations in the solid phase.

2.5. Distinction between direct numerical simulation and
macrohomogeneous model

To summarize the electrochemical physics presented in the pre-
vious  sub-sections,  we  present  a  fine-scale  mathematical  model
of  binary  electrolyte  intercalation  chemistries-based  LIBs  with  a
fully  resolved  electrode-electrolyte  interface  alongside  the  requi-
site  interface  and  boundary  conditions.  This  example  is  used  to
expand on the concepts discussed earlier (direct numerical simu-
lation (DNS)), and how boundary and initial conditions are applied
to  the  governing  equations  of  electrochemical  physics.  Further-
more, connection between the fully resolved DNS model and vol-
ume averaged macrohomogeneous model are established to pro-
vide a better understanding of the coupling between the modeling
paradigms.

Lithium-ion  battery  physics  encompasses  species  and  charge
transport in the electrolyte ( Li + , PF6 −) and electrode ( Li, e −) phases
alongside interfacial charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte in-
terface. The nature of the charge carrier changes at the electrode-
electrolyte interface contributing to ionic current in the electrolyte
phase  (motion  of  Li + ,  PF6 −)  and  electronic  current  (motion  of
e −) in the solid phase. For  DNS on the fully  resolved electrode-
electrolyte structure this translates into the following set of cou-
pled governing differential equations

Solid state diffusion: Li transport inside the solid active mate-
rial  particles  is  through  diffusion  under  concentration  gradients
and Eq. (18) is solved (neglecting advection) with Fickian diffusion
( Eq. (21) ) to model transport inside the active material.

here, c e  is the concentration of Li +  ions in the pore phase elec-
trolyte,  D e  is  the  ionic  diffusivity  of  Li + ,  t +  is  the  transference
number which accounts for the fraction of ionic current, i e , carried
by Li + . It should be noted that ionic current occurs through mo-
tion of both positive and negative charged species and hence frac-
tional contributions of individual charged species appears in the
species conservation equation. Additionally Eq. (27) is a variation
of Eq. (13) for a mesoscopic domain.

(27)

Electrolyte  phase  current:  The  ionic  current  has  contributions

from electrolyte potential and concentration gradients.
i e = −( κ∇ φe + κD ∇ ln c e )
(28)
here, φe is the electrolyte phase potential, κ and κ D are the ionic
and diffusional conductivity of the binary electrolyte respectively.

Charge conservation in the electrolyte phase (ionic current): Con-

servation of ionic charge in the electrolyte phase leads to
∇ · ( κ∇ φe + κD ∇ ln c e ) = 0

(29)

Charge conservation in the solid phase (electronic current): Elec-
tronic current is given using Ohm’s law (only migration) and cor-
responding solid phase charge conservation takes the form
∇ · ( σ ∇ φs ) = 0
(30)
here, σ is the electronic conductivity of the solid phase and φs is
the electrostatic potential of the solid phase.

In addition to flux continuity, the above governing equations are
coupled through the electrode-electrolyte interface via the follow-
ing:

−D s ∇ C s · ˆ n = −D e ∇ C e · ˆ n =

F

−σ ∇ φs · ˆ n = −( κ∇ φe + κD ∇ ln C e ) · ˆ n = i

(32)

where  ˆ n is the local surface normal pointing from the solid phase
towards the electrolyte phase, and i is Butler–Volmer current den-
sity as given by Eq. (9) . It is apparent that the electrochemical re-
action terms appear as interface conditions in the DNS formula-
tion. The boundary conditions at the solid-phase current collector
interface will be given by
−σ ∇ φs · ˆ n = −( κ∇ φe + κD ∇ ln C e ) · ˆ n = i app
where i app is the applied current density for the system. It should
be noted here that the exchange current density for Li-ion based

From  the  above  discussion,  it  is  clear  that  the  electrochemi-
cal charge transfer reactions proceeding at the electrode-electrolyte
interface appear as interfacial or boundary conditions for the fully
resolved DNS model. With an appropriate set of initial conditions,
the above formulation is well-defined to obtain the temporal and
spatial evolutions of the concentration and potential fields inside
the LIB. However, this approach enforces a huge amount of com-
putational  burden  and  requires  the  fully  resolved  electrode  mi-
crostructure geometry.

Alternatively,  if  an  electrode-electrolyte  assembly  is  homoge-
nized  and  represented  as  a  composite  material,  then  a  source-
term representation can be developed as is seen for the volume
averaged macrohomogeneous models. Through homogenization of
the  porous  electrode  microstructure,  volume  averaged  quantities
are obtained with the primary parameters of consequence being
porosity  ε,  pore  phase  tortuosity  τ ,  active  material—electrolyte
specific surface area a s and effective electronic conductivity of the
solid phase σ eff . Porosity accounts for the fraction of void space in
the porous electrode while tortuosity is a measure of the convolut-
edness of the transport pathways inside the porous electrode. The
interfacial electrochemical reactions occur at the electrolyte-active
material interface; hence, the corresponding surface area is an im-
portant  descriptor  for  the  electrode-electrolyte  assembly.  Finally,
the effective electronic conductivity is a measure of the electronic
conductivity of the composite solid phase microstructure consist-
ing of active material and secondary inclusions. The effective pore
phase transport parameters can then be obtained through the fol-
lowing relations:

Correspondingly,  the  macrohomogeneous  model  for  the  LIB
consists  of  the  following  set  of  governing  differential  equations
(variables being the same as described for the DNS model):

It  should  be  noted  that  the  homogenized  governing  differen-

terms  similar  to  Eq.  (3) .  Herein  lies  the  difference  between  the
macrohomogeneous and DNS models. While, the interfacial elec-
trochemical reactions present as interface terms in the DNS model,
the effective medium approach of a macrohomogeneous model is
able to treat the interfacial reactions as source terms in the gov-
erning differential equations. The corresponding boundary condi-
tions for the macrohomogeneous model are enumerated below as
well.

3. Mesoscale modeling methods

Mesoscale modeling methods focus on resolving the chemical-
physical processes occurring within porous microstructures and at
interfaces and surfaces within electrochemical devices. There are
two broad categories of computational methods used to simulate
mesoscale  phenomena  in  electrochemical  devices,  particle-based
methods,  and  mesh  based  or  fine-scale  computational  fluid  dy-
namics (CFD) methods. In both methods, the microstructure of in-
terest needs to be defined a priori and is an input to the model.
In the following sub-sections we describe methods of microstruc-
ture representation, the fundamentals of various mesoscale model-
ing methods along with notable results and some of the challenges
of using these methods.

3.1. Porous microstructure representation

Mesoscale modeling of electrochemical systems requires the ge-
ometrical details of the microstructure, such as a porous electrode,
as  input.  Naturally,  the  accuracy  of  pore-scale  calculations  is  di-
rectly tied to the fidelity of microstructural information. Realiza-
tions of porous microstructures can be obtained either by experi-
mental imaging or by stochastic reconstruction methods.

3.1.1. Experimental imaging

There  are  two  main  experimental  methods  for  imaging  3D
porous  microstructures,  X-ray  computed  microtomography  (XCT)
and  focused  ion  beam—scanning  electron  microscopy  (FIB-SEM)
[34] .  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  tremendous  progress  in
XCT  [35,36,45–47,37–44]  based  3D  porous  structure  reconstruc-
tion,  which  is  a  non-invasive  experimental  technique.  FIB-SEM
[48–52] is a destructive technique that uses a focused ion beam
to slice the sample plane-by-plane while simultaneously imaging
each of these planes. The XCT technique uses X-rays, which have
much smaller wavelengths than the visible light and proffer suffi-
cient resolution. On the other hand, FIB-SEM relies on accelerated
electrons that exhibit a wave nature (de Broglie waves). The wave-
length of the associated waves is inversely related to the square

root  of  the  accelerated  voltage  and  equivalently  the  wavelength
could be made small enough to probe microstructural attributes.
These  two  techniques  are  quite  different  in  terms  of  the  probe
(X-ray energy vs. electron waves), interaction with the sample, and
interpretation of the contrast data. X-rays penetrate solids, while
electrons do not. Current XCT technology does not provide enough
contrast with respect to some materials, e.g., carbon additives and
polymeric binder domains in LIB electrodes, while FIB-SEM is more
restrictive in terms of the field of view. At the end of the exper-
iment,  these  contrast  images  are  analyzed  to  reconstruct  porous
electrodes. A typical workflow for XCT is shown in Figs. 2 , and 3
provides an illustration of the multi-scale nature of the FIB-SEM
technique.

3.1.2. Stochastic reconstruction

Stochastic reconstruction, on the other hand, is quite an effi-
cient approach to study a wide variety of electrode microstructures
with  different  compositions,  porosities,  particle  types,  etc.  Addi-
tionally,  it allows one to generate large enough domains (unlike
FIB-SEM) containing all the relevant phases (unlike XCT). In other
words, stochastic reconstruction can be suitably used to circum-
vent the limitations of imaging techniques as and when required.
For  the  reconstructed  microstructures  to  represent  realistic
electrodes,  generation  routines  often  march  (evolve  the  struc-
ture)  to  match  statistical  details  of  experimental  structures,  e.g.,
phase  fractions,  contact  probability,  2-point  correlation  function,
etc.  [53,54] .  Such  techniques  must  guarantee  connectivity  of  the
solid phases (active material, conductive additive and binder taken
together)  for  efficient  electronic  conduction  in  the  electrode,  for
the resulting microstructural realizations to be of practical signifi-
cance.

3.1.2.1. Monte Carlo (MC).  Monte Carlo modeling [55–59] for mi-
crostructure regeneration is based on random number generators
and  statistical  distributions.  First  particle  dimensions  and  orien-
tations are specified in the form of statistical distributions. Then
particle locations are randomly generated till the particle volume
fraction equals the prescribed value. Particle overlap is allowed to

Fig. 2.  Image processing steps translate raw image data into 3D microstructural reconstruction of porous electrodes. The raw images (a) are first aligned with respect to
each other so the same pixel on successive images correspond to identical in-plane locations on the electrode and then cropped to isolate the region of interest (b). At this
stage other corrective steps are applied such as filtering. Next the images are segmented to identify material phases (c), and eventually these are combined together to give
a 3D reconstruction (d). The images in (a) to (c) are obtained from open source XCT data for a LIB cathode [47] , while (d) is reconstructed from corresponding segmented
image slices.

shifting particle locations. The new particle location is accepted or
rejected based on a probabilistic rule. Thus, every new microstruc-
ture is closer to the desired state and eventually converges after a
finite number of operations.

3.1.2.2. Dynamic  particle  packing  (DPP).  This  approach  [53,60]  is
derived from molecular dynamics simulations. Here active mate-
rial,  conductive  additive  and  binder  particles  are  randomly  dis-
tributed  as  per  user-specified  volume  fractions.  The  system  is
evolved in time till its minimum energy state is reached (i.e., equi-
librium  state)  based  on  suitable  interparticle  force  descriptions.
The active particles are modeled as hard spheres while conductive
additive and binders are treated as soft spheres to ensure connec-
tivity  of  the  solid  phase.  The  method  can  be  easily  extended  to
work with non-spherical particulate matter, if the functional na-
ture  of  the  force  field  is  available.  For  the  reconstruction  to  be
more realistic, experimental particle size distributions are used in-
stead of having monodisperse particles.

3.1.2.3. Stochastic  grid.  This  approach  is  quite  closely  related  to
Monte Carlo generation [43,51,53] . In this method, a possible mi-
crostructure is generated by randomly placing solid phase parti-
cles. Then multiple successive realizations are obtained by swap-
ping neighboring particles (thus maintaining volume constancy) till
the  statistical  function  of  the  generation  structure  (e.g.,  2-point
correlation  function)  matches  the  experimentally  obtained  value.
Alternatively the system can also be driven to a minimum state
of energy. As the microstructure is randomly generated, ensuring
particle connectivity becomes a challenge, unless particle overlap
is allowed.

3.1.2.4. Simulated annealing.  This algorithm starts with a random
configuration  of  particulate  phases  [61,62] .  Energy  is  defined  in
terms of an objective statistical descriptor (here energy is used in
a generic sense). Then successive new structures are generated by

3.1.2.5. Controlled  random  generation  /  quasi-random  generation.
Such  a  procedure  grows  electrode  structure  sequentially  [63,64] .
First  random  seeds  are  chosen,  and  active  particles  are  grown
around them to meet the desired volume fraction. Due to the ran-
dom  seed  initiation,  the  generated  phase  tends  to  be  well  con-
nected as the volume fraction is increased. Once, the active mate-
rial is grown, conductive additive and binder are selectively grown
on active material surfaces, thus further ensuring solid phase con-
nectivity. Due to this selective nature, the technique is referred to
as controlled random generation or quasi-random generation.

3.1.2.6. Applications  of  stochastic  reconstruction  to  electrochemical
systems.  Recently a novel physics-based description was developed
to add secondary (non-intercalating) solids in the active material
backbone for LIB electrodes, Fig. 4 [65] . This not only allows one
to reconstruct composite electrode structures with all the essential
details but also helps delineate physicochemical limitations arising
from microstructural complexations. Future efforts should harness
the lucrative aspects of stochastic reconstructions in order to ex-
tend the scope of imaging techniques as well as foster a holistic
view of composite electrode structures.

Similarly,  stochastic  microstructure  generation  methods  have
received significant attention in the PEFC, namely for the recon-
struction of the porous catalyst layer (CL), microporous layer (MPL)
and  fibrous  gas  diffusion  layer  (GDL)  [54,66,67] .  3-D  realization
of the non-woven carbon paper GDL was reconstructed based on
structural  inputs  (fiber  diameter,  fiber  orientation  and  porosity),
which can be obtained either directly from the fabrication spec-
ifications  or  indirectly  from  the  SEM  (scanning  electron  micro-

processes. These morphologies could range from a film-type coating to a finger-like arrangement. Reprinted with permission from [65] . Copyright 2018 American Chemical

3.2. Particle methods

Various  particle-based  numerical  methods  have  been  used  to
model the multiphase physics of electrochemical devices, such as
reactive transport, heat transfer and solid mechanics. These meth-

ods include dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), smoothed parti-
cle  hydrodynamics  (SPH),  discrete  element  methods  (DEM),  and
the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). DPD, SPH and DEM methods
are all considered off-lattice methods, where the domain is repre-
sented by Lagrangian particles, which move throughout the system
due to the forces acting on them. In these methods, there is no grid
or mesh used in the simulation domain. The LBM represents the
domain as a collection of pseudo-particles, which interact via prop-
agation and collision on a discrete lattice domain structure. In all
particle methods each particle carries its physical properties with
it (i.e. temperature, density, concentrations, etc.) and evolves over

128

time based on interactions with neighboring particles, which are
calculated based on a weighted interaction term. The exact form
of a particle’s interactions with neighboring particles is what dis-
tinguishes one method from another.

Although all of these methods have been used to model fuel
cells, batteries and other electrochemical devices; SPH, DPD, and
LBM are the most widely used for mesoscale modeling of electro-
chemical devices and will be the focus of this section.

3.2.1. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics fundamentals

In  smoothed  particle  hydrodynamics  (SPH)  particles  are  used
as interpolation points to discretize and solve the governing par-
tial differential equations of a system based on the SPH smoothing
function (kernel). The SPH method is based on the integral inter-
polation scheme for a continuous field, A [69]

(cid:21)

A s ( (cid:2) x ) =

(cid:10)
(cid:10)
A ( (cid:2) x ) W ( (cid:2) x − (cid:2) x (cid:10) , h ) d
x

(40)

where A s is the smooth approximation of A , W is the SPH kernel
with a support length of h and the integration is performed over
the entire domain of A . The kernel, W , is chosen such that it is
differentiable, normalized over the volume,

(cid:21)

W ( (cid:2) x (cid:10) − (cid:2) x , h ) d (cid:2) x (cid:10) = 1

(cid:10)
x ∈ (cid:14)P ∪ (cid:14)S

(cid:14)P ∪ (cid:14)S
and tends towards the delta function as h → 0. When W is the delta
function Eq. (40) reproduces A exactly [69] .

In  the  SPH  method,  the  computational  domain  is  discretized
with a set of particles, and the integral, Eq. (40) , is approximated
as the summation:
(cid:2)

(cid:2)

A s ( (cid:2) x ) =

A i W ( (cid:2) x − (cid:2) x i , h ) =

summation  over  all  particles  [69] .  In  general,  the  summation  in
Eq. (42) is over all particles but due to the form of the kernel only
particles within a distance h from the particle of interest will have
a  non-zero  contribution  to  the  sum  and  need  to  be  included  in
the summation in the numerical implementation of a SPH method.
This greatly reduces the computational cost of SPH simulations.

Since the SPH kernel is differentiable, the gradient of A s can be

Using the SPH formulation of a field ( Eq. (42) ) and its derivative
( Eq. (43) ) the partial differential equations of a system can be writ-
ten in SPH form. SPH has many attractive features, which provide
it with an advantage over finite difference and finite element mod-
els for problems involving geometrically complex domains and/or
surface interactions. The meshless discretization of SPH allows the
conservation equations to be solved in the Lagrangian framework.
The particle nature of SPH permits easy implementation of physical
and chemical effects within advection modeling. SPH also explicitly
conserves mass and linear momentum and due to its Lagrangian
nature does not require explicit boundary tracking, which allows
for simple implementation of complex geometries and/or moving
boundaries [70] . SPH also has a number of disadvantages, which
have limited its application, some of these include the implemen-
tation  of  boundary  conditions,  discretization  error,  and  conver-
gence and stability issues under high parameter gradients. These
are  all  active  areas  of  research  within  the  SPH  community  [71] .
SPH was originally developed for astrophysical systems [72,73] and

has since been applied to a variety of fluid dynamics and reactive
transport  problems  [70,74–77] .  Recently,  SPH  models  have  been
developed  to  investigate  the  complex  physics  of  electrochemical
devices, including the operation and degradation of both fuel cells
and batteries [78–82] .

3.2.2. Dissipative particle dynamics fundamentals

Dissipative  particle  dynamics  (DPD)  is  a  mesoscale  particle-
based  method,  which  simulates  hydrodynamics  and  thermal
fluctuations.  It  was  originally  developed  by  Hoogerbrugge  and
Koelman [83] and formulated as a statistical mechanics model by

The conservative force ( F C ) is a soft repulsion force, which acts

The dissipative force ( F D ) and stochastic force ( F R ) constitute a
pair-wise Brownian dash-pot model and represent the viscous and
thermal noise between particles, respectively [86] . Both forces in-
clude a “bell-shaped” weighting function to model the particle in-
teractions and F R also includes a stochastic term, such as a Wiener
Process,  to  introduce  randomness.  Common  formulations  for  the
dissipative and stochastic forces are [86] ,

DPD has been used as a method for upscaling molecular dy-
namics (MD) scale simulations and a bridge between coarse grain
MD  and  continuum  CFD  models  [87] .  However,  DPD  has  several
limitations, which need to be considered when using the method.
These limitations include the inability to specify thermodynamics
behavior as an input, for instance the model can be fit to the com-
pressibility of a fluid but in doing so may cause the predicted pres-
sure to be unrealistic. The dissipative nature of the method does
not allow temperature gradients to be sustained. For multiphase
flows, DPD will not capture the drag between neighboring particles
unless it has a radial velocity component. The formulation is hard-
wired to scale such that changing the number of particles in the
system requires reparametrizing the system, i.e. there is no such

thing as convergence or grid refinement in DPD. Finally, the ther-
mal fluctuations of DPD are not a function of volume or size and
as such do not scale with the system. Modifications to the origi-
nal DPD formulation have been implemented to overcome some of
the limitations of the model [86] . The fluid particle model (FPM)
adds a shear force to DPD that depends not only on the approach-
ing velocity but also on the velocity difference, which overcomes
the  simplistic  friction  forces  of  DPD.  Further  modifications  have
led to the smoothed DPD method, which is based on an SPH for-
mulation and includes a thermal fluctuation term that scales with
size [86] .

3.2.3. Lattice Boltzmann method fundamentals

The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a particle-based, meso-
scopic  approach  with  a  simplified  kinetic  description  based  on
classical statistical physics. Within the LBM framework, a fluid is
represented  as  a  collection  of  pseudo-particles  and  interacts  via
propagation  and  collision  on  a  discrete  lattice  domain  structure.
The LBM is inherently a scale-bridging numerical scheme, which
incorporates simplified kinetic models to capture microscopic flow
physics, and the ensemble-averaged quantities satisfy the macro-
scopic  behavior  [88] .  Due  to  the  underlying  kinetic  nature,  the
LBM  has  received  wide  acceptance  in  fluid  flow  applications  in-
volving interfacial dynamics and complex boundaries, e.g. multi-
phase/multicomponent flows in porous medium [88] . In the con-
text of electrochemical devices, the LBM has received significant
interest in investigating the underlying physicochemical and two-
phase transport behavior in the constituent microporous compo-
nents in fuel cells [54] .

The two-phase LB modeling algorithms, reported in the litera-
ture, and variants thereof, include the model by Gunstensen et al.
[89] ,  Shan  and  Chen  [90,91] ,  Swift  et  al.  [92,93] ,  and  He  et  al.
[94] . Among these two-phase LB models, the model by Shan and
Chen [90,91] is widely used due to its simplicity in implementing
boundary  conditions  in  complex  porous  structures,  versatility  in
handling fluid phases with different densities, viscosities and wet-
tabilities, as well as the capability of incorporating different equa-
tions of state.

In  brief,  the  Shan  and  Chen  model  introduces  k  distribution
functions for a fluid mixture comprising of k components. Each dis-
tribution function represents a fluid component and satisfies the
evolution equation. The non-local interaction between particles at
neighboring lattice sites is included in the kinetics through a set
of potentials. The evolution equation for the k th component can
be written as:

i (x + e i δt , t + δt ) − f k
f k

i (x , t) = −

i (x , t) − f k (eq )
f k

(x , t)

(49)

f k
(x , t)  is  the  number  density  distribution  function  for  the  k th
i
component in the i th velocity direction at position x and time t ,
and δt is the time increment. In the term on the right-hand side,
τ
k is the relaxation time of the k th component in the lattice unit,
and  f k (eq )
(x , t) is the corresponding equilibrium distribution func-
i
tion. The right hand side of Eq. (49) represents the collision term
based on the BGK (Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook), or the single-time re-
laxation approximation [95] . The spatio-temporal discrete form of
the LB evolution equation based on the BGK approximation, given
by Eq. (49) , is often referred to as the LBGK equation. A typical
3-D 19-speed lattice (D3Q19, where D is the dimension and Q is
the number of velocity directions), with the velocity directions, is
shown schematically in Fig. 6 .

The phase separation between different fluid phases, the wet-
tability of a particular fluid phase to the solid, and the body force,
are taken into account by modifying the velocity used to calculate
the equilibrium distribution function. An extra component-specific

velocity due to interparticle interaction is added on top of a com-
mon velocity for each component. Interparticle interaction is real-
ized through the total force, F
k , acting on the k th component, in-
cluding fluid/fluid interaction, fluid/solid interaction, and external
force. More details can be found in the reference [97] .

The continuity and momentum equations can be obtained for
the fluid mixture as a single fluid using the Chapman–Enskog ex-
pansion procedure in the nearly incompressible limit:

The  primary  physical  parameters,  such  as  the  fluid/fluid  and
fluid/solid interaction parameters, need a priori evaluation through
model calibration using numerical experiments. The fluid/fluid in-
teraction gives rise to the surface tension force and the fluid/solid
interaction manifests in the wall adhesion force. The fluid/fluid and
fluid/solid interaction parameters are evaluated by designing two
numerical experiments, the bubble test in the absence of the solid
phase and the static droplet test in the presence of a solid wall, re-
spectively. The details of these numerical experiments are detailed
elsewhere [97,99,100] .

3.2.4. Notable results

Particle-based  modeling  methods  have  been  used  to  investi-
gate reactive transport within multiphase regions of electrochem-
ical  devices.  In  particular  studies  have  considered  the  effects  of
microstructure on the wettability, water transport and proton con-
duction of PEFCs [101–105] , multiphase transport of the electrolyte
in  vanadium  flow  batteries  [106,107] ,  effects  of  electrode  struc-
ture on LIB performance and thermal characteristics [81,108–112]
and porous reactive transport and degradation in SOFC electrodes
[80,113–121] . Here we will highlight some of the notable results
from these studies and direct the reader to the references for fur-
ther details.

tionally they showed that restricted mass flux and increased tor-
tuosity in seperators can restrict mass transport enough to reduce
dendrite growth, Fig. 8 , and validiated their models with experi-
mental data [82,112] . Tan et al.’s work shows the use of mesoscale
models not just for model development but for improved battery
performance  and  design  of  new  battery  microstructures.  Taking
mesoscale  models  from  simply  the  academic  and  computational
science  realm  and  into  the  experimental  and  design  realm  will
help to accelerate development of electrochemical devices.

Two-phase transport in the porous CL and GDL of PEFCs  has
been a center of investigation due to the deleterious impact arising
from electrochemical surface area coverage and pore blockage due
to water resulting in transport limitations and performance decay
in PEFCs. Pore-scale understanding of capillarity driven two-phase
transport  and  flooding  phenomena  has  been  a  central  theme.
Particle-based  mesoscale  modeling  methods  have  been  able  to
consider  the  effects  of  microstructure  and  polymer  structure  on
water transport in Nafion and other membranes [85,101] . Dorenbos
used a combined DPD – Monte Carlo modeling method to consider
the effects of polymer branching on pore structure and diffusion.
He was able to show that pore topology is critical to water dif-
fusion within Nafion [101] . The DPD method was able to resolve
large enough length scales to consider pore-scale diffusion; smaller
scale methods such as molecular dynamics are not able to resolve
large enough scales to accurately consider pore-scale effects. Ad-
diontally, the pore-scale DPD simulations were able to identify dif-
ferences in transport due to pore structure such as dead-ends and
bottlenecks  which  are  not  easily  described  at  larger  or  smaller
length  scales.  Others  have  also  investigated  the  effects  of  struc-
ture on water transport and clustering and as with Dorenbos have
found  that  structural  changes  in  the  ionomer  significantly  effect
water locations [85] .

LBM has received significant attention in studying the effect of
capillarity-wettability interactions in the PEFC CL and GDL struc-
tures. Fig. 9 shows the steady state advancing liquid water fronts
inside a typical catalyst layer microstructure in response to cap-
illary  pressure  increments  in  a  primary  drainage  simulation,  re-
ported  by  Mukherjee  et  al.  [66] .  The  CL  microstructure  used
exhibits hydrophobic wetting characteristics with a static contact
angle  of  100  ̊.  The  initially  air-saturated  microstructure  (wetting
fluid) shows larger liquid water infiltration with higher capillary
pressure. The capillary fingering regime is observed at low capil-
lary pressures whereby the liquid water saturation front exhibits
finger  like  patterns.  Surface  tension  driven  capillary  forces  drive

The  effects  of  microstructure  and  changes  to  the  microstruc-
ture are critical areas of research for mesoscale models across bat-
tery and fuel cell technologies. The ability of particle-based meth-
ods  to  easily  handle  complex  and  changing  geometries  has  lead
them  to  be used  in a  number  of  studies  considering the  effects
of mesoscale microstructure and heterogenities on device perfor-
mance.  Changes  to  the  porosity,  tortuosity,  pore  size  and  pore
distribution  can  be  used  to  tune  the  performance  of  electrodes,
such  as  in  LIB  electrodes  where  the  porous  structure  is  critical
to the wettability of the liquid electrolyte and therefore the bat-
tery performance. Lee at al use LBM simulations to show that the
porous  microstructure  can  lead  to  pore  blockage  and  resistance
that decreases wettability and performance, highlighting the need
for careful design of electrode microstructures [102] . Mohamma-
dian and Zhang expanded on Lee et al.’s findings and use LBM to
investigate the use of microchannels in LIB electrodes to improve
wettability and prevent thermal runaway, Fig. 7 [108] .

Particle-based methods have also been used to explore the ef-
fects of mesoscale heterogeneties and have shown that inclusion of
the microstructrue is critical to understanding device performance.
He  et  al  investigated  the  effects  of  isotropic  vs.  anisotropic  mi-
crostructural properties in the cathode of an SOFC using LBM [116] .
Their work focused on the development of a multi-scale model-
ing apporach where a LBM sub-grid model of reactive transport in
the cathode microstructure is coupled with a coarse finite element
model (FEM) of overall battery performance. Their work showed
the importance of accounting for mesoscale heterogenities for the
accurate prediction of SOFC performance, in particular accurately
capturing  heterogeneous  diffusion  lead  to  more  accurate  predic-
tions of electrode tortuosity.

Tan et al. used a mesoscale SPH model to investigate the effects
of anisotropic mass transfer near the anode-electrolyte interface in
Li-air batteries for the study of dendrite growth [81,112,122] . Their
work showed that controlled mass transport could be an effective
strategy for suppressing dendrite growth in Li-air batteries. Addi-

the penetration of the liquid water phase into the resident air wet-
ting  phase  region  in  the  shape  of  fingers.  With  increasing  cap-
illary  pressure,  the  capillary  fingering  regime  transitions  to  the
stable displacement regime owing to the merging of several pen-
etrating saturation fronts. This study points to an interesting con-
clusion; even for extremely low capillary number flows inside the
CL, the advancing liquid water front metamorphoses from a finger-
ing structure to a somewhat flat structure as the capillary pressure
rises.

hibiting higher hydrophobicity as compared to the CL investigated
above, with a static contact angle of 140  ̊. Fig. 10 displays the liquid
water distribution as well as the intrusion pattern with increas-
ing capillary pressure in the initially air saturated GDL. Owing to
the stronger hydrophobicity and larger pore size, the liquid water
front incursion and droplet formation ensues only at some pref-
erential locations for low capillary pressure. As the capillary pres-
sure increases, formation and penetration of several water fronts is
observed due to capillarity. The multiple fronts coalesce and form
two  major  chunks,  which  advance  in  the  less  tortuous  in-plane
direction.  Beyond  a  threshold  value  of  capillary  pressure,  one  of
the fronts reaches the air reservoir, the physical equivalent of the
GDL/air interface, at a preferred location, which is termed the bub-
ble point. These simulations reveal the strength of two-phase LBM
models, which can capture intricate liquid water dynamics includ-
ing droplet formation, coalescence and front propagation through
the hydrophobic fibrous GDL structure.

3.2.5. Advantages and disadvantages

Particle  methods  have  many  advantages  and  disadvantages
amongst themselves and when compared to mesh based model-
ing methods. In general, particle methods are better able to han-
dle complex geometries and dynamic interfaces in multiphase sys-

tems. The ability to implicitly track moving interfaces without the
need for dynamic and adaptive meshing increases the stability of
these methods and reduces the computational cost associated with
tracking boundaries. This is especially critical in mesoscale mod-
eling  of  electrochemical  systems  where  the  interfaces  are  inte-
gral  to  the  electrochemical  reactions  of  the  systems  and  are  of-
ten  the  areas  of  greatest  instability  and  performance  loss,  such
as the issues of dendrite growth at the electrode-electrolyte inter-
face in batteries, or the wettability of PEFC electrodes [81,82,101] .
In both of those examples resolving the multiphase interfaces and
multiphysics phenomena are essential to investigating those sys-
tems.

Overall particle-based methods tend to be more computation-
ally expensive than mesh based Eulerian methods. Due to the La-
grangian  nature  of  particle  methods,  neighboring  particles  have
to be determined at every time step, which adds to the compu-
tational  cost  of  the  methods.  Although  with  increasing  comput-
ing power, wider access to high performance computing resources,
and adaption to GPU computing these computational costs are be-
coming less of a roadblock. Additionally by coupling particle-based
methods with less expensive mesh-based and statistical methods,
we  can  develop  multi-scale  modeling  methods  that  resolve  the
mesoscale phenomena and couple it to the large-scale system per-
formance in a computationally efficient manner.

The DPD method has been used as a bridge to the atomic level
modeling of MD. Creating a direct connection to small scale MD
continues to be a challenge for continuum modeling methods. The
similarities between the MD and DPD methods have allowed the
direct coupling between the two methods through the interaction
potentials between DPD particles, which have been parameterized
based on MD simulations. Coupling to MD limits the scales DPD
methods can model to the order of microsecond and nanometers
but allows it to bridge the microscale to continuum level phenom-
ena [101] .

Both the DPD and LBM methods require calibration of model
parameters. In LBM, the primary physical parameters, such as the
fluid/fluid and fluid/solid interaction parameters, need a priori eval-
uation  through  model  calibration  using  numerical  experiments.
Similarly, DPD requires parameterization of interaction potentials
via MD modeling or literature data. SPH does not require calibra-
tion  of  model  parameters  as  it  is  based  on  the  physical  contin-
uum governing equations (i.e. Navier-Stokes, energy conservation
and  species  conservation).  Additionally  DPD  is  limited  in  that  it
cannot consider gas diffusion [101] .

conditions) has been an ongoing challenge in the SPH community
[123–126] .

LBM has received significant attention in modeling two-phase
flow and transport in complex porous microstructures, e.g. in the
PEFC  CL  and  GDL;  however  it  is  still  challenging  to  incorporate
the  full  gamut  of  the  multi-physics  interactions  such  as  species,
charge and thermal transport in such electrochemical systems. A
viable pathway could be to develop a hybrid approach, including
LBM and CFD, which can be quite attractive in capturing the mi-
crostructure  and  electrochemistry  coupled  multi-modal  transport
and flow [54] .

3.2.6. Challenges

3.3. Fine-scale CFD

Each of the three particle-based methods discussed in this sec-
tion  have  challenges  that  need  to  be  addressed.  As  with  most
numerical  methods,  there  is  always  the  drive  to  increase  stabil-
ity, consistency and convergence, and improve computational ef-
ficiency.  This  is  true  of  particle-based  methods  and  includes  re-
search into discretization of the governing equations in SPH and
formulations of particle interactions in DPD. Additionally, the use
of  adaptive  particles  for  multi-scale  resolution  is  being  consid-
ered to improve computational efficiency, which will allow larger,
more complex  systems to  be considered. The implementation of
boundary conditions is also an ongoing area of research and im-
provement  in  SPH  and  DPD.  The  proper  formulation  of  bound-
ary  conditions  that  retain  the  intrinsic  conservation  of  SPH,  and
properly represent the physics (i.e. no slip boundaries, inlet/outlet

In recent years, there has been significant progress in studying
electrochemistry  coupled  transport  phenomena  with  microstruc-
ture resolved CFD based modeling frameworks. Conventional CFD
approaches, such as the finite volume method (FVM) and finite el-
ement method (FEM), use macrohomogeneous formulations based
on volume-averaged transport properties and variables over a rep-
resentative elementary volume, which fail to capture the porous
microstructure heterogeneity and complexity. The microscopic de-
tails  of  the  pore  structure  are  implicitly  resolved  and  homoge-
nization  over  the  porous  electrode  volume  is  performed  to  ob-
tain  averaged  geometric  and  transport  properties  like  porosity,
specific surface area, tortuosity, effective diffusivity, effective con-
ductivity, etc. Typically, empirical correlations used to describe the

effective properties as a function of porosity and tortuosity of the
porous medium are incognizant of the actual porous microstruc-
tural  details,  which  further  affect  the  predictive  ability  of  such
macrohomogeneous formalisms. In this regard, microstructure re-
solved  direct  numerical  simulation  (DNS)  formalization  captures
the effect of microstructure-transport-electrochemistry interactions
in porous structures in electrochemical energy systems. The DNS
methodology also provides an effective tool for estimating effec-
tive  transport  property  correlations  representative  of  porous  mi-
crostructures, such as constructing Bruggeman correlations.

The porous electrodes in electrochemical energy systems con-
sist  of  multiple  components,  having  distinct  geometrical,  physi-
cal  and  chemical  features,  enabling  multifunctionality  owing  to
electrochemistry-coupled  interactions  among  multiple  transport
processes. These multi-physical interactions ultimately dictate the
electrochemical properties and performance, which in turn are in-
tricately linked to the multi-component and spatial arrangements
in the porous electrode microstructures. Traditionally, porous elec-
trode theory has been employed to understand the electrochem-
ical response of these systems [4] . Porous electrode theory how-
ever  is  too  restrictive  in  the  sense  that  it  makes  quite  a  few
assumptions regarding the structural arrangement as well as the
relative  length  and  time  scales  of  mechanisms.  Direct  numerical
simulation, in other words calculations performed at the pore-scale
accounting  for  realistic  geometrical  features,  ameliorates  these
shortcomings. One obvious limitation of DNS is the increased cal-
culations, which scale in proportion to the spatial degrees of free-
dom. Given this dilemma, two distinct types of DNS strategies are
in practice and will be discussed hereafter. The first one abstracts
the real microstructural attributes based on pore-scale calculations
(DNS) and this representative volume element (RVE) scale informa-
tion is encoded in the porous electrode descriptions in the form of
effective properties such as pore phase tortuosity and active area
[65,127,128] . The  other  school  of  thought  carries  out  all  the  cal-
culations of electrochemical progressions directly at the pore-scale
[129–134] . In the truest sense, the later approach is traditional DNS
while  the  former  has  been  termed  pseudo-DNS.  Both  FVM  and
FEM based calculations can be carried out in either of these con-
texts. Since fundamentally electrochemical systems rely on species
and charge transport, FVM calculations may be preferred owing to
their inherent conservativeness. FVM and FEM are widely used in
the  computational  field  and  as  such  are  not  described  in  detail
here. The reader can find detailed descriptions of the theory and
formulation of FVM and FEM in the literature [135,136] .

3.3.1. DNS fundamentals: effective property estimation

Porous microstructures are typically characterized in terms of
their effective properties to offer insights into relevant transport
and  interfacial  interactions.  These  effective  properties  essentially
account for the spatial arrangement of different phases and how
they  lead  to  quantitatively  different  behaviors  compared  to  the
bulk  phase.  For  example,  ionic  transport  in  the  bulk  electrolyte
is  characterized  by  ionic  conductivity  and  diffusivity,  but  when
the electrolyte is filled in a complicated pore network, this trans-
port is further affected by geometrical features such as pore size,
shape and connectivity. The effect of these attributes is quantified
in  terms  of  properties  such  as  porosity  and  tortuosity.  Once  re-
constructed electrode volumes are available, DNS calculations are
performed to assess these properties. Porosity is computed by in-
tegrating over the pore phase volume, while the interfacial area is
estimated via summing over phase boundaries. Calculation of other
properties  such  as  tortuosity  is  more  intensive.  Consider  species
transport [65] in a complex pore network filled with electrolyte.
The steady state concentration profile in the bulk is dictated by
the elliptic equation:
∇ · ( D ∇C ) = 0

(52)

where D is diffusivity in the bulk electrolyte. In a porous electrode
structure,  this  species  transport  will  not  take  place  in  locations
that contain solid phase(s). When this species transport is averaged
over an RVE, the above governing equation transforms to:
∇ ·

(cid:15)
D eff∇  ̃ C

= 0

(53)

(cid:14)

where D eff is effective diffusivity and   ̃ C represents the concentra-
tion field in an RVE. For liquid electrolytes, diffusion is isotropic in
the bulk (i.e., no directional dependence) when volume averaged
over a porous electrode, it becomes a tensor since tortuosities in
each of the coordinate directions can be different. In other words,
x  = Dε / τx where ε is open porosity and τ x is tortuosity in that

particular direction. In order to obtain a tortuosity value in a par-
ticular direction, say x , concentrations are fixed at the two ends
( C = 1 at x = 0 and C = 0 at x = L x  planes) and the other four sur-
faces ( y = 0, L y and z = 0, L z ) have zero flux across them. Once the
corresponding  pore-scale  concentration  field  is  available,  species
flux  is  computed  in  the  direction  of  interest  (since  steady  state
profiles are sought, J x = constant at any x ):

Equating the two and using the relation D eff

x  = Dε/ τx , one back
computes pore network tortuosity in the given coordinate direc-
tion. A similar procedure is repeated to get the other two tortuosi-
ties: τ y and τ z . For a sample LIB composite electrode, the steady
state concentration profile in the pore phase is shown in Fig. 11 for
the three coordinate directions.

Typically, in electrodes, the pore phase facilitates ionic trans-
port,  while  the  solid  phase  is  responsible  for  electronic  conduc-
tion. The conductivity calculations are carried out in a similar fash-
ion as the tortuosity. One additional consideration is to ensure the
continuity  of  electron  flow  at  an  interface  of  the  two  adjoining
solid  phases.  Like  the  concentration  equation  ( Eq.  (52) )  for  tor-
tuosity,  the  electric  potential  equation  is  solved  for  conductivity
estimation. Representative electric potential contours are given in
Fig. 11 as well.

The DNS  approach has proven to  be  a viable method  for  es-
timating  effective  transport  properties,  such  as  oxygen  diffusiv-
ity,  electronic  and  ionic  conductivity  in  the  CL,  GDL  and  ML  of
a PEFC. Fig. 12 shows the DNS-based numerical estimation along
with experimental measurement of the effective oxygen diffusiv-
ity and electron conductivity of a typical PEFC nonwoven carbon
paper GDL, reconstructed from XCT imaging, under different com-
pression pressures which affect the underlying microstructure and
hence the effective properties [137] . This study highlights the ef-
ficacy of the DNS approach in estimating the influence of porous
microstructures  on  the  effective  transport  properties  for  electro-
chemical energy systems.

It is important to recognize the correlation between the evo-
lution of predictive modeling and its intended application. Porous
electrodes (electrochemical reactors) were proposed five decades
ago with the goal to increase the reaction surface area per unit
volume. This comes at the cost of pore-scale transport resistance.
The  porous  electrode  theory  was  thus  proposed  to  understand
the complexations arising from the porous three-dimensional na-
ture  of  the  reacting medium  without  having to  carry  out  calcu-
lations at the pore-scale [138] . At this stage, neither the accurate
3D  structural  information  (e.g.,  imaging)  nor  the  accurate  mod-
eling and computational framework were available to study pre-
cise  three-dimensionality,  and  the  porous  electrode  theory  pro-

vided  a  reasonable  understanding  of  these  effects  [139]  (at  best
the  quantitative  scales).  With  the  new  material  discovery  in  re-
cent years, the electrode structures have become more complicated
[140,141] , and require commensurate advances in the mathemati-
cal treatment of porous electrodes. DNS based effective property
calculations [142,143] have quite suitably accounted for such mi-
crostructural realism with minimalist computational overhead for
electrode-scale  electrochemical  interactions  [65,128,144] .  Such  an
approach has also fostered the study of evolving electrochemical
systems such as lithium-sulfur batteries which undergo consider-
able microstructural changes during their operation [145,146] . Such
a pseudo-DNS approach allows one to consistently deconvolute the
representative pore-scale effects and how they scale at larger elec-
trode thickness length-scales [147] . Electrode-scale DNS would not
elucidate such an intricate scale-bridging interplay. The next gen-
eration energy storage systems are much more complicated, partly
due to their severe geometrical changes, for example, high volume

expansion materials such as silicon [148] and tin [149] , lithium foil
[150] and similar metallic film electrodes and porous hosts [151] .
The associated complexities would make electrode-scale DNS cal-
culations  essential  to  the  physicochemical  interpretation  of  such
systems. Additionally, the extreme response of present-day tech-
nologies such as fuel cell corrosion, repeated cycling or extreme
fast charging of lithium-ion cells, also demands DNS computations
to access physical insights into these systems (e.g., Fig. 16 ). A judi-
cious selection from this spectrum of DNS strategies is invariably
a compromise between the level of details and the particular phe-
nomenon being studied.

3.3.2. Notable results

Here  we  present  representative  highlights  of  DNS  modeling
with a focus on electrode microstructural complexations and how
these  give  rise  to  the  thermo-electrochemical  attributes  related

Fig. 13.  The secondary phase introduces nonlinear effects on RVE scale transport processes. It increases the kinetic and electrolyte transport resistance, and it also increases
the effective electronic conductivity. The morphology of these secondary solids is also quite relevant since it dictates the relative importance of short- and long-range
interactions. (a) RVE scale resistance for a composite electrode with 95% wt. active material. (b) Effective electronic conductivities as a function of electrode composition.

alluded to earlier, the composite electrodes in LIBs contain non-
intercalating solids: conductive additives for electronic conductiv-
ity  (typically  the  Li  storing  phase  on  the  cathode  side  has  very
low electronic conductivity) and polymeric binder to ascribe me-
chanical stability. However, on the flip side, the presence of these
secondary solids limits the space available for ionic transport (i.e.,
electrolyte)  as  well  as  Li  storage  (i.e.,  active  material),  and  in
turn  reduces  the  specific  energy  and  power.  Additionally,  these
secondary phases alter the pore network and partially cover the
active  material  surface  area.  In  other  words,  the  presence  of  a
secondary phase increases the pore phase transport resistance and
kinetic resistance to intercalation due to reduced electrochemically
active area. These complexations are plotted in Fig. 13 based on
the effective property characterization results via pseudo-DNS for
such composite cathodes. These microstructural interactions per-
meate to the electrochemical response of the corresponding elec-
trodes, and are discussed elsewhere [65,127] .

Since the relevant charge transport and conversion take place
at the pore-scale, heat generation is always accompanied given the
finite rate of these processes. Additionally, entropy change during
operation  also  manifests  as  heat.  Fig.  14  schematically  identifies
these distinct contributions, where representative composite elec-
trode structures are shown along with the color legends for differ-
ent material phases. Reduced porosity and/or increased tortuosity
leads to greater Joule heating due to increased ionic transport re-
sistance. On the other hand, if porosity is increased (at identical
active material to secondary phase composition by weight), elec-
tronic conductivity reduces which increases the Joule heating due
to  the  electronic  conduction  limitation.  Different  phase  arrange-
ments as well as their contents alter the electrochemically active
area, which correlates to the kinetic overpotential, and equivalently
the heat generation related to charge transfer resistance. Note that
reduced  porosity  means  the  electrode  can  house  more  electro-
chemical energy, but at the cost of higher intrinsic heat generation
[128] .

This intricate relation of porosity, electrochemical operation and
temperature rise due to heat generation is explored in Fig. 15 . First
consider figures (c) and (d) which detail cell capacity when oper-

ated at different rates (at different ambient temperatures). As the
porosity is decreased, achievable capacity increases since more ac-
tive material is present in the same volume. When the porosity
is  around  a  lower  threshold,  the  ionic  resistance  can  shutdown
the electrochemical electrodes. In this regime, the capacity drops
drastically.  The  onset  of  this  ionically  induced  shutdown  is  ear-
lier as the operation is carried out at a higher current. Next con-
sider  the  corresponding  thermal  interactions  (subfigures  (a)  and
(b)).  As  porosity  is  reduced,  temperature  rises  to  greater  values,
which pushes the cell from safe to risk or risk to unsafe limits.
At too low porosities, since the electrochemical operation is termi-
nated early, not enough heat is generated to increase the temper-
ature to concerning levels. The severity again is exacerbated if the
operation is carried out at a higher ambient temperature. In this
event, efficiency of convective cooling decreases and in turn zones
for unsafe and potential risk operation expand. These calculations
highlight a critical limit of LIB technology from a thermal safety
standpoint: high energy cells have severe thermal experiences.

Previous  illustrations  detail  the  pseudo-DNS  approach  where
all  the  essential  phases  and  microstructural  features  are  char-
acterized  and  passed  on  to  the  porous  electrode  theory  based
electrochemical description. On the other hand, in a typical DNS
approach,  electrochemistry  coupled  species  and  charge  transport
processes are solved directly on a small enough RVE of the porous
electrode microstructure. Mukherjee and Wang [152,153] were the
first to present such a DNS approach to study the electrochemi-
cal reaction kinetics, species and charge transport to characterize
the physical processes occurring inside the porous cathode CL of a
PEFC. This DNS method was based on a single-domain FVM frame-
work, which included charge transfer kinetics of the oxygen reduc-
tion reaction occurring at the electrochemically active sites char-
acterized by the triple phase boundary, oxygen and water vapor
transport though the pore phase, and proton (charge carrier) trans-
port in the electrolyte phase. This approach enabled studying the
compositional influence on the PEFC CL performance as well as lo-
cal overpotential and reaction current distributions. Following this
DNS approach, several studies by other groups appeared in the lit-
erature [64,154–157] . As a representative example, the DNS model

was used to study the influence of structural variation of a bi-layer
cathode CL in a PEFC on the underlying transport and performance
[153] . The design of the bilayer CL incorporates physical colloca-
tion of two catalyst-coated membrane layers, designated as A and
B layers, each with equal platinum catalyst loading and thickness.
The two layers differ in the ionomer to carbon (I/C) weight ratios,
which  leads  to  varying  pore  and  electrolyte  phase  volume  frac-
tions.  Fig.  16  displays  the  3-D  reaction  current  distributions  for
different relative humidity conditions, which affect the underlying
proton and oxygen transport, and electrochemical reactions. It is
evident that a high humidity operation results in higher reaction
current density distribution, thereby minimizing the overpotential
loss and enhancing CL utilization. The lower relative humidity con-
ditions exhibit reaction current snap off which renders a signifi-

cant portion of the CL, with the expensive platinum catalyst, virtu-
ally inactive. This study highlights that a suboptimal porosity near
the CL /GDL interface compounded by the reaction zone shift to-
wards membrane-CL interface in the A/B CL inhibit oxygen trans-
port resulting in inferior performance as compared to the B/A CL.
The results further emphasize the importance of the DNS models
in elucidating a detailed pore-scale description of the underlying
transport in the PEFC CL microstructure and other electrochemical
electrode designs.

A similar DNS modeling strategy was later employed to study
electrochemical and species/charge transport characteristics in the
LIB electrode RVEs as well. Fig. 17 shows an example of the lithia-
tion dynamics of a Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide electrode [129] .

dependence  of  electrochemistry  on  structural  arrangement.  The
study  reveals  that  the  distribution  of  the  solid  phase  potential
closely  correlates  with  the  instantaneous  state  of  lithiation  and
particle dimensions. Smaller particles undergo more uniform lithi-
ation and subsequently the state of charge is higher (equivalently
smaller potential) when analyzed at a fixed instant of time after
lithiation. It is important to note that DNS modeling of LIB elec-
trodes has received significant recent attention [63,158–160] .

3.3.3. Advantages and disadvantages

The  DNS  approach  is  well  positioned  to  take  advantage  of
the tremendous progress in CFD based simulation methods with
high-fidelity computational schemes and advanced software plat-
forms. The multi-physics coupling inherent in porous electrodes for
electrochemical energy systems can be captured with relative so-
phistication. However, a critical aspect in such simulations is the
inherent importance of the interface driven electrochemically re-
active processes, which rely heavily on the resolution of the triple
phase  and/or  pore/solid  boundaries.  Since  the  DNS  method  is  a
grid-based  fine-scale  CFD  approach,  the  interface  resolution  re-
quires grid generation complexity, which may escalate the compu-
tational cost. A voxel-based approach on the other hand can reduce
the grid generation complexity as well as computational cost, how-
ever it suffers from adequate representation of the inherently com-
plex interfaces. As compared to the particle-based approaches, the
DNS method is more flexible and adaptable to incorporating differ-
ent physics-based processes through appropriate governing differ-
ential equation constructs and relative ease of the boundary con-
dition implementation.

3.3.4. Challenges

The  fine-scale  CFD  based  DNS  approach  has  witnessed  a
steadily growing interest in recent years to study reactive-diffusion
processes in porous electrodes. However, this approach is fraught
with  some  challenges.  Resolving  the  interface  in  complicated
porous  electrode  microstructures  is  critical  due  to  the  very  na-
ture  of  the  interface  driven  electrochemically  reactive  processes
coupled  with  species  and  charge  transport.  This  would  require

advances  in  sophisticated  workflow  including  experimental  im-
age processing (e.g. XCT data), microstructure reconstruction and
interface  capturing  techniques  in  order  to  consider  a  reasonable
size  of  the  electrode  microstructure  domain  for  high-fidelity  as-
sessment of the influence of heterogeneities on the electrochem-
ical and transport properties and performance. Another challenge
is how to capture interface evolution due to a side reaction, for
example  formation  of  the  solid  electrolyte  interphase  or  lithium
electrodeposition  in  LIBs.  The  DNS  approach  would  require  sig-
nificantly  novel  ways  to  handle  such  phenomena.  Although  the
fine-scale  CFD  method  is  quite  effective  for  modeling  reactive-
diffusive processes in porous microstructures, studying two-phase
flow  consisting  of  the  capillarity-wettability-interface  interaction,
such  as  in  the  case  of  PEFCs,  is  challenging.  Undoubtedly,  the
DNS  method  is  a  powerful  mesoscale  technique;  however,  there
is plenty of room for fundamental advancements in both numer-
ical and physics-based sophistications that can push the envelope
for microstructure-transport-reaction interactions in electrochemi-
cal energy systems.

4. Summary

As  discussed  in  this  review  there  are  several  computational
methods being developed for the simulation of electrochemical de-
vices and each method has unique advantages and disadvantages
that  make  it  well  suited  for  different  applications.  The  particle-
based  methods  such  as  LBM,  SPH,  and  DPD,  are  well  suited  for
modeling complex and deforming geometries; while DNS takes ad-
vantage of the computational and algorithmic advances of the ma-
ture CFD field and is easily able to incorporate the complex physics
and boundary conditions of the electrodes.

Mesoscale  modeling  has  been  used  to  investigate  the  design,
performance, and fundamental physics of SOFCs, PEFCs, and LIBs.
These studies have provided valuable insights into how mesoscale
phenomena  affects  the  macro-scale  behavior  of  electrochemical
devices, such as microstructural effects on water transport in PE-
FCs, or dendrite growth in lithium batteries.

Continued  advances  in  the  numerical  methods  and  computa-
tional  resources  will  allow  mesoscale  modeling  to  play  a  more
prominent role in the research and development of advanced elec-
trochemical energy systems. Additionally they will be critical in ad-
vancing use of rational materials design for electrochemical devices
and for the development of multi-scale modeling methods.

5. Challenges and future perspective

Understanding the mesoscale interactions is critical to the im-
provement in performance, safety and life of electrochemical en-
ergy systems. Mesoscale modeling is poised to play an exceedingly
important role in discerning the microstructure complexations of
electrochemistry coupled transport phenomena that directly affect
the system response, Fig. 18 . Such a mesoscale paradigm can serve
as  a  bridge  between  materials  discovery  and  system  response.
Hence, there is a crucial need for advancing the mesoscale mod-
eling predictions to inform microstructure discovery and design.

There are several challenges facing the further development of
these computational methods. The most significant of those is the
lack of experimental data for the verification and validation of the
models and for input parameters for the models. It is very diffi-
cult, if not impossible, for current experimental methods to resolve
mesoscale phenomena in situ. The macro-scale data that is avail-
able is difficult to relate back to the mesoscale physics and requires
assumptions and extrapolation of data for comparison to mesoscale
models. Concurrent development of advanced experimental char-
acterization and visualization techniques are needed to allow the
realization  of  the  full  power  and  potential  of  mesoscale  model-
ing methods in advancing the architecture design and discovery in
electrochemical energy systems.

As advances in experimental and computational methods con-
tinue there are vast areas where mesoscale modeling could be a
significant  asset  to  the  electrochemical  field.  Rationale  design  of
materials  systems  is  one  such  area.  Starting  with  the  Materials
Genome Initiative [161] , there has been a significant push in recent
years to take advantage of the vast computational resources to ac-
celerate the development of new materials. Electrochemical energy
systems is one field that is ripe to take advantage of this. Molecular
scale modeling and high throughput computing have been applied
to areas such as new electrolyte or electrode materials discovery
in LIBs. However, as several of the studies highlighted in this re-

view point out for most electrochemical devices the critical design
aspects are not just the materials used but also the mesoscale ar-
chitecture of the materials, such as the porous electrodes. To truly
advance their designs both the materials and the microstructure
must be considered and mesoscale modeling can bridge this gap.

Another critical area where mesoscale modeling can help ad-
vance  electrochemical  systems  is  in  the  safety  of  these  devices.
This  is  especially  critical  for  the  advancement  of  lithium  batter-
ies.  The  thermal  response  of  LIBs  under  abuse  conditions  such
as short-circuiting, overcharging, thermal runaway, and mechani-
cal failure are critical research areas for the improvement of cur-
rent  LIB  technologies  and  for  the  advancement  of  lithium  metal
batteries [162] . As discussed in the DNS section mesoscale model-
ing  has  shown  that  the  electrodes  can  experience  local  extreme
temperature  conditions.  At  this  point  most  research  into  safety
issues  has  focused  on  experimental  testing  and  characterization.
Most  computational  efforts  in  this  area  have  considered  simpli-
fied one dimensional models, and hybrid, multidimensional models
[162–164] . However, few modeling effort s have considered safety
issues at the mesoscale, which could help in understanding ther-
mal responses to abuse conditions. Current mesoscale modeling ef-
forts into dendrite growth could be used a starting point for ex-
pansion into safety modeling by addition of thermal models in the
presence of dendrites.

The  use  of  mesoscale  modeling  in  materials  system  design
raises the second major challenge for these computational meth-
ods,  namely  the  computational  cost  of  running  simulations.  By
their nature, mesoscale models are computationally expensive as
they resolve the detailed microstructures and multi-physics inter-
actions. However, with the continuing advances in computational
power and expanding high performance computing resources this
challenge is not a major roadblock to the continued and expanded
use  of  mesoscale  methods.  Additionally,  mesoscale  methods  are
being developed for use in multi-scale modeling approaches where
a limited number of expensive mesoscale simulations can be used
to  inform  more  efficient  upscaled  and  statistical  based  models
