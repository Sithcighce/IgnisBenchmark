Microalgae have gained considerable attention as an alternative feedstock for the biofuel production, particularly
in combination with genetic modification strategies that target enhanced lipid productivity. To tackle climate
change issues, phasing out the usage of fossil fuels is seen as a priority, where the utilization of biofuel from
microalgae  serves  as  a  potential  sustainable  energy  source  for  various  applications.  These  photosynthetic
microalgae utilize solar energy and carbon dioxide to produce energy-rich compounds (i.e., starch and lipids),
that can be further converted into biofuels of different types. Among different types of biofuels, biodiesel from
the transesterification of triacylglycerols stands out as the most sustainable replacement of transportation fuel
over fossil-based petroleum diesel. However, hurdles such as limited productivity, overall production cost and
challenges in upscaling the algal technology leaves a huge gap on the road to commercialized microalgae-based
biofuel. This review article first presents a comprehensive overview of imperative knowledge regarding micro-
algae in terms of algal classification, factors affecting the growth of microalgae during cultivation and different
steps in upstream processing. This review also discusses recent advances in downstream processing of microalgal
biorefinery. Additionally, this review paper focuses on deliberating various recent strategies of genetic modifi-
cations and their feasibility for enhanced lipid productivity in microalgae. Finally, the current challenges and
future  perspectives  of  microalgae-based  biofuels  are  highlighted  in  this  review  discussing  several  aspects,
including sustainability of microalgae-based biofuel production, current status of algae-based industry, risks and
legislation considerations of genetic modification of microalgae.

1. Introduction

Energy plays an important role in the lives of every living organism,
including humans. From simple processes like heating and cooking to
transportation and electricity, a large amount of energy is consumed.
Currently, we are heavily dependent on fossil fuels as the main source of

energy [1]. Fossil fuels refer to fuels that have been formed from biomass
and stored underground millions of years ago. The major types of fossil
fuels include coal, oil and natural gas [2]. Fossil fuels like coal play an
important role in modern life since the industrial revolution that took
place in the 18th century. The reliance then gradually shifted towards oil
and gas in the 20th century with the introduction of internal combustion
engines  [3].  Fossil fuels  are  widely  used as  they  provide high  energy

efficiency  and  are  convenient  to  be  obtained  with  appropriate  infra-
structure  compared  to  solar  or  wind  energy,  which  is  dependent  on
weather and geographical location [4]. In 2019, global fossil fuel con-
sumption was found to be 136,761 TWh, which was around 1500 times
more compared to two centuries ago [5].

The major issue associated with fossil fuels is the emission of large
amounts  of  greenhouse  gases  into  the  atmosphere.  The  whole  supply

chain of fossil fuel from drilling wells to burning as fuel results in the
emission  of  greenhouse  gases such  as  methane (CH4),  carbon  dioxide
(CO2),  sulphur  oxides  (SOx)  and  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx).  Emissions  of
these anthropogenic gases contribute to global warming which further
leads to climate change, ocean acidification and environmental pollu-
tion. Sulphur oxides and the particulate matter or soot released from the
burning of fossil fuel cause pulmonary disease in humans. Additionally,

exposure to the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing for drilling oil
and  gas  may  cause  water  contamination  and  can  cause  cancer  in
humans. Other negative effects of using fossil fuels include degrading
soil quality, damaging the ecosystem and environmental pollution due
to oil spillage or gas leakage [6]. As a matter of fact, the concentration of
atmospheric CO2 was projected from 280 ppm to 419 ppm from 1900 to
2019  [7],  however,  in  2021,  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  level  was
found to be 416.45 ppm. Eventually, in the next 25 years, it is expected
that the global surface temperature will rise by 1.5–5.9
C due to un-
controlled  CO2  emissions  [7]. To  prevent the  worst  effects  of  climate
change, governments around the world agreed to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases as part of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. One of
the  targets  in  the  agreement  is  to  phase  out  and  make  fossil  fuels
obsolete while moving towards the goal of net zero emission (an indi-
cator  to  balance  between  carbon  emission  and  carbon  sink  in  the  at-
mosphere)  by  replacing  them  with  alternative  and  renewable  energy
sources [2,3]. As a result, tremendous research has been done to explore
the  opportunities  in  renewable,  green  and  carbon-neutral  biofuels, as
this  strategical  pathway  would  be  the  main  contributor  in  reducing
greenhouse  gas  emissions,  as  well  as  to  provide  sustainable  solutions
towards greener production processes.

◦

Biofuel is seen as a key alternative to the usage of fossil fuel because
of its lower emission profile of greenhouse gases, particularly for CO2
emission, predominantly employed in the transportation sector [8]. The
chemical  characteristics  of  biofuels  can  either  be  liquid  (e.g.,
bio-methanol, bioethanol, biobutanol, biogasoline and biodiesel), solid
fuel  (e.g.,  biocoal)  or  gaseous  (e.g.,  biohydrogen,  biogas,  syngas  and
biomethane)  mainly  from biomass [9].  Liquid  biofuels  are commonly
used  for  combustion  engines  in  most  transportation  sectors,  whereas
solid  and  gaseous  biofuels  are  usually  used  for  heat  and  power  pro-
duction [9,10]. Biofuels can be categorized into first-, second-, third and
fourth-generation of biofuels depending on the type of feedstock used
[11]. First-generation biofuels are prepared using food crops and dedi-
cated  bioenergy  crops  composed  of  sugar,  starch  and  vegetable  oil.
To-date, Brazil is the foremost country that embarked on utilizing sugar
cane as raw material for biofuel production, in which the extracted juice
consists of high sucrose content and is fermented to produce bioethanol
as fuel [12]. Whereas, in the United States, corn and soybean are uti-
lized, while the European countries have used sugar beet as the feed-
stock for bioethanol production [13]. However, it is a controversial issue
to prepare the biofuel using food crops, which has raised questions and
serious  constraints  about  whether  food  crop-producing  biofuels  are
actually beneficial toward subsidized biofuel programs, or if it has had a
detrimental impact on food pricing and food security [14]. To overcome
these  issues,  second-generation  biofuels  focus  on  utilizing  waste  and
residual feedstocks from non-food-related biomass such as waste vege-
table oil and forest/agricultural residue (i.e. lignocellulosic biomass) for
the production of biofuels [15]. These types of biomass are derived from
lignocellulosic-based  material  (e.g.,  leaves,  tree  barks,  sawdust,  pulp
waste, thinned wood, corn stover, bagasse, straws) which are one of the
most abundant biological resource that can be obtained anywhere in the
world [16]. While second generation biofuels offer great abundancy and
cost effective route over food crop producing biofuels, the challenges of
utilizing this feedstock are related to its intrinsic physical structure (e.g.
cellulosic composition such as lignin, hemi-celullose and lignin) during
the conversion process of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels [15,17].
Algae (i.e., macro- or microalgae, commonly microalgae are used)
are the feedstock for third and fourth-generation biofuel [18]. The main
difference  between  third  and  fourth  generation  biofuel  is  the  imple-
mentation of genetic modification/engineering of algae for algal-based
biofuel  production  [19].  Microalgae  are  photosynthetic  microorgan-
isms that have a higher growth rate compared to any terrestrial plant.
Microalgae are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems across the world, even
in various types of wastewaters. Via photosynthesis, microalgae convert
light  and  carbon  dioxide  to  produce  highly  valuable  bioactive  com-
pounds such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins and pigments

which can be converted into various bioproducts for the chemical and
pharmaceutical  industries  [20,21].  It  was  reported  that  1  kg  of  algal
biomass can assimilate about 1.83 kg of carbon dioxide along with some
sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides [22]. Microalgae species accumulate
mostly lipids which can be converted into biofuel and may contain up to
70%  of  lipids  on  a  dry  weight  basis  [23].  Other  advantages  of
algal-based biofuels compared to fossil fuels include low or negligible
sulphur emission and high oxygen levels in fuel combustion [22].

Although the process of biofuel production from microalgae is well
studied, the economic feasibility of the overall biorefinery process re-
mains  a  challenge  for  its  commercialization.  For  instance,  the  cost
attribution on the chemicals involved in its cultivation (upstream pro-
cessing), strategic ways to recover high value-added components from
algal biomass and the optimization requirement for product conversion
(downstream  processing)  remain  a  hurdle.  Various  studies  have  been
conducted to resolve these limitations by seeking low-cost alternative
nutrients (as the culture medium) found in different types of wastewa-
ters and integrating multiple processing (i.e. pretreatment and recovery
process) into a single system to overcome the high cost associated with
biofuel  production  from  microalgae  [24,25].  Other  than  economic
cost-related issues, the production of high biomass concentration accu-
mulated  with  a  high  lipid  yield  is  also  essential  for  efficient  biofuel
production [26]. Other than applying stress and altering the microalgae
cultivation conditions (e.g., cultivation medium pH, low/high light in-
tensity  and  nutrient  starvation),  fourth-generation  biofuel  production
involves multidisciplinary research in the field of biotechnology, biology
and  biochemistry  and  chemical  engineering,  with  the  generic  term
referred  to  as  “genetic  engineering  or  genetic  modification”  to
facilitate microalgae modification at the molecular level of cellular ac-
tivity  to  overexpress  genes  or  enzymes  specifically  for  lipid  synthesis
[27]. This strategy aims to develop and improve strains of microalgae
with high lipid production and accumulation abilities via genetic and
metabolic  modification  tools  [28].  In  recent  years,  there  are  some
studies relevant to gene functions and genome sequencing in microalgae
for  the production of  biofuels. For instance, the  enzyme catalyzed by
diglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT2) was reported for the formation of
triglycerides  from  diacylglycerol  and  fatty  acyl-CoA  [29].  Phospho-
enolpyruvate  carboxylase  (PEPC1)  gene  in  Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii
showed 74.4% lipid content enhancement [30] and overexpression of
acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS2) achieved 2.4-fold higher accumulation of
triacylglycerol  [31].  Beside,  further  possibilities  including sequencing
irradiation  mutagenesis,
strategies
sequencing-by-synthesis,  single-molecule  real-time  sequencing,  and
pyrosequencing  may  be  worth  exploring,  however,  these  options  are
limited as of now [32]. To realize these blue-sky possibilities, the current
trend of genetic engineering research should incorporate computational
biology  (i.e.,  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  logarithms  and  machine
learning), bioinformatics and multiomic datasets to further discover the
precise assembly and annotations of the genome annotation in micro-
algae research [25,26,33,34].

This  review  aims  to  explore  the  prospects  of  microalgal  lipid  as  a
source of biofuel production, its importance, current trends and possi-
bilities  of  applying  genetic  modification  on  microalgae  as  metabolic
modification tools for enhancement of lipid accumulation. For readers,
this review will provide a comprehensive overview covering different
aspects of upstream and downstream processing of microalgal technol-
ogy.  In  particular,  the  upstream  processing  section  includes  critical
discussion  about  topics  related  to  microalgal  cultivation  modes  (i.e.,
phototrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic) and the classification of
microalgae. In downstream processing section, various recent advances
in extraction, recovery technologies for value-added products and their
respective  mechanistic  studies  have  been  evaluated.  Besides  that,  the
mechanistic  pathways  of  the  lipid  production  and  lipid  profiles  in
microalgae are examined to understand the applications and quality of
microalgal lipids in biofuel production towards a sustainable alternative
over  fossil-based  fuels.  Besides  conventional  methods,  the  advanced

methods such as genome editing, and altering metabolic pathways for
the genetic modification of microalgae are also discussed, which have
been  used  in  achieving  higher  lipids  production  and  accumulation.
Overall, this review will provide a comprehensive resource highlighting
that  microalgae  are  an  important  feedstock  for  producing  biofuels.
However, more research is needed to fill the knowledge gaps to improve
the  lipid  production  in  microalgae  for  practical  applications.  Table  1
comprehensively  compiles  a  series  of  specific  topics  involved  in  the
present  review  paper  and  compares  the  distinguished  features  of  the
present review with previously published reviews on the topic.

2. Microalgae: a general overview

Microalgae  research  has  been  conducted  extensively  across  the
world.  Due  to  their  remarkable  cultivation  abilities  over  terrestrial
plants, microalgae have gained wide interest in the research community
for the production of a wide range of high-value bioproducts (i.e., bio-
diesel,  bioethanol,  biomethane,  biohydrogen,  bioenergy,  biofertilizer,
algae-feed and supplements) from the algal biomass. Despite the major
advantages,  there  exist  many  challenges  in  utilizing  microalgae  as
feedstock  especially
in  the  overall  upstream  and  downstream
processing.

Microalgae  are  simple  plant-like  structure  (thallophytes)  without
roots, stem and leaves, and primarily consist of chlorophyll a and b as
their principle pigment which play an important role in photosynthesis.
The chemical structure of chlorophyll a is responsible for the absorp-
tion/capture of light energy for oxygenic photosynthesis, while chloro-
phyll b is the accessory pigment that helps to collect light energy and
transfer  it  to  chlorophyll  a  [45,46].  This  process  is  similar  to  photo-
synthetic characteristics of terrestrial plants in capturing sunlight irra-
diance  and  assimilating  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  allowing
them  to  grow  and  reproduce  [47].  Both  CO2  and  light  energy  are
absorbed by chloroplasts which is reduced into adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) and oxygen (O2) as the “energy currency” to support the growth of
microalgae [48,49]. In this way, photosynthesis is a regulating process
in  the  microalgal  cell  metabolism  which  enables  the  growth  and
biosynthesis  of  biological  macromolecules  (i.e.,  protein,  lipid,  carbo-
hydrates,  carotenoids  and  micronutrient)  stored  within  the  cells  of
microalgae. Once microalgal cells have reached maturation (stationary
phase),  the  harvested  algal  biomass  is  further  processed  into  their
respective high-value bioproducts.

2.1. Upstream processes in microalgal cultivation: growth modes and
growth conditions

Microalgae are phototrophic organisms that undergo photosynthetic
process and assimilate atmospheric CO2 from aquatic habitats [50]. On
the other hand, microalgae also require organic carbon and inorganic
nutrients for their growth. The growth of microalgae can be categorized
into  four  different  types  of  growth  patterns,  namely:  i)  lag  phase,
exponential phase, stationary phase and death phase [51]. Lag phase is
the  initial  phase  in  which  microalgae  adapt  to  its  surrounding  (e.g.,
culture  medium,  system  pH,  temperature,  and  light  intensity).  Expo-
nential phase takes place once microalgae are able to adapt to the cul-
ture  medium  and  surrounding  environment.  Since  microalgae  have
regulating mechanism capabilities, eventually they will adapt and sus-
tain themselves to reach stationary phase. Throughout the growth pro-
cess, biological macromolecules such as protein, lipid, carbohydrates are
biosynthesized  and  developed  within  the  organelles  of  microalgae.
Subsequently in the stationary phase, the nutrients in the culture me-
dium are decreased after consumption by microalgae for cell growth and
cell devision, and eventually, some mature algae will undergo cell lysis
(i.e. cell death). Lastly, during death phase, there is an equal ratio be-
tween new cells and dead cell which may show a decrease in the con-
centration of microalgal biomass.

In most cases, microalgal cultivation is carried out on a smaller scale

(in 50 mL–100 mL tissue culture flask) or in a petri dish consisting of
agar culture medium. This stage can also be used to store and sustain the
microalgae culture before transferring it to a larger cultivation scale. It is
usually  suggested  to  inoculate  and  transfer  about  10–20%  of  the  sta-
tionary phase microalgal biomass into a new batch culture medium (i.e.
preculture stage) for effective growth. The following section will provide
a  clearer  explanation  and  focus  on  the  growth  processes  that  include
autotrophic  (i.e.,  photoheterotrophic  and  photoautotrophic),  hetero-
trophic and mixotrophic growth modes.

2.1.1. Photoheterotrophic and photoautotrophic growth of microalgae

Photoheterotrophic  growth is  a  method  that requires both  natural
sunlight and organic carbon substrate (e.g., glucose, acetic acid, glyc-
erol,  fructose,  sucrose,  maltose  and  molasses)  for  the  cultivation  of
microalgae. It is considered a feasible approach for large-scale produc-
tion of algal biomass as it involves the use of free natural resource e.g.
sunlight in most open pond production systems. Sunlight is sufficient in
countries with tropical climate which have two main seasons (wet/rainy
and dry season) throughout the year. Most open pond systems may also
be  installed  with  submerged  aerators  or  mechanical  paddlewheels  to
increase the atmospheric CO2  absorption by agitation and help in ho-
mogenization of the cultivation system [47]. But, the challenges remain
in  this  method  due  to  the  contamination  problems  that  arise  due  to
organic carbon substrates being used as carbon source [52].

Unlike photoheterotrophic growth which utilizes additional organic
carbon  sources  for  the  cultivation,  photoautotrophic  growth  involves
photosynthesis process by utilizing inorganic carbon from atmospheric
carbon dioxide sources, natural sunlight and water to generate chemical
energy to be used in cellular function (i.e., biosynthesis and respiration)
[53].  In  most  cases,  photoautotrophic  growth  is  considered  the
economically  feasible  cultivation  method  as  it  does  not  require  any
additional supplement of organic sources. Many studies have reported
that lipid content ranges between 5% and 68% depending on the type of
microalgal  species  [54–56].  Photoautotrophic  growth  is  an  efficient
cultivation method for carbon sequestration (i.e., capturing and storing
of  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide)  and  contributes  to  the  reduction  of
global  carbon  dioxide  as  microalgae  consume CO2  (present  in  the  at-
mosphere)  as  the  carbon  source  for  cell  growth.  Both  phototrophic
cultivation conditions should be performed in outdoor cultivation sys-
tems (e.g. raceway pond or open pond) to ensure it receives sufficient
amount of sunlight. However, the challenge of outdoor cultivation sys-
tems may involve the risk of contamination, low biomass concentration
and high harvesting cost for microalgal cultivation [57]. Fig. 1 shows the
illustration of different growth modes for the cultivation of microalgae.

2.1.2. Heterotrophic growth of microalgae

Some microalgae species have also been found in the environment (e.
g.  polar  regions,  buried  in  sediments,  or  underneath  the  periphyton)
where  natural  sunlight  is  unable  to  reach  [58–60].  Due  to  these
light-deprived  environments,  these  microalgae  adapt  by  undergoing
heterotrophic  metabolism,  mainly  dependent  on  glucose  for  their
growth. Heterotrophic growth of microalgae involves the use of external
organic  carbon  sources  (i.e.  glucose,  sucrose,  lactose,  galactose,  glyc-
erol,  acetate and  fructose)  under dark conditions  [61].  Glucose has  a
high energy content and it can enhance physiological growth, especially
in microorganisms [62]. The metabolic pathway of carbon sources in
heterotrophic  conditions  involves  enzymatic  reactions  such  as  trans-
portation, activation (i.e., phosphorylation), intermediary anabolic and
catabolic metabolism. The cytoplasmic membrane of microalgae allows
the  transportation  of  substrate  between  the  microalgae  cells  and  the
environment [63]. This allows them to control the intake and movement
of  nutrients  via  translocation  and  transduction  functionality.  Several
metabolic  pathways  have  been  discussed  in  literature  such  as  the
oxidative pentose  phosphate (PPP) pathway in dark conditions, Emb-
den–Meyerhof–Parnas  (EMP)  in  light  conditions  and  GS/GOGAT
pathway for ammonium assimilation [64,65]. It has also been reported
that  heterotrophic  growth  conditions  induce  high  biomass,  lipid  pro-
ductivity and provide better growth rates [65,66]. However, some het-
erotrophic microalgae species may not induce or produce low amount of
metabolites such as carotenoid/pigments, and it requires a controlled
fermenter to hinder external light penetration during their cultivation
process [65,67].

2.1.3. Mixotrophic growth of microalgae

Mixotrophic growth of microalgae is performed using both organic
and  inorganic  carbon  sources  integrated  with  dark  and  light  cycles
[68–70].  In  general,  the  term  “mixotrophic”  means  the  mixture  of
phototrophic and heterotrophic growth for microalgal cultivation. As a
result, mixotrophic growth is characterized as “carbon fixation” which
allows microalgae to assimilate inorganic source from CO2  during the
dark condition (heterotrophic) and simultaneously increases its ability
to  drain  high  organic  carbon  concentration  in  the  presence  of  light
(phototrophic) [67,71]. In fact, mixotrophic growth allows microalgae
to  produce  and accumulate  photosynthetic carotenoids  such as  astax-
lutein,  fucoxanthin,  phycocyanin  and  β-carotene  under
anthin,
controlled illuminated conditions [72]. The biosynthesis of high-value
metabolites  in  the  mixotrophic  growth  of  microalgae  requires  inten-
sive optimization of each parameter, including light intensity, temper-
ature and optimal culture medium ratio (carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and

phosphorus (P)). Recent studies have reported the ability of microalgae
for  bioremediation  of  various  wastewaters  (i.e,  piggery,  furfural,
sewage,  municipal  and  textile)  and  industrial  flue  gases  under  mixo-
trophic  and  heterotrophic  growth  conditions  [73–78].  However,
microalgae alone cannot bioremediate complex wastewater types, and
sometimes algal growth is inhibited [79]. Therefore, co-culturing other
microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) with microalgae is important [80–84].
This practice allows the creation of symbiotic interaction (mutual rela-
tionship) between bacteria and microalgae to undergo the exchange of
oxygen, carbon dioxide and ammonium ions during the bioremediation
[85]. Table 2 shows the effect of different organic substrates used and
biomass productivity in different growth modes of microalgae.

2.2. Classification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microalgae

Microalgae are unicellular or multi-cellular microorganisms that are
commonly found in freshwater, seawater, saline water and even deserts
and  the arctic. Microalgae  perform photosynthesis by assimilating  at-
mospheric CO2 and release oxygen (O2) to the atmosphere [103]. There
are around 400,000 different species of microalgae identified and the
species  can  be  categorized  into  eukaryotic  or  prokaryotic  [22,104].
Prokaryotic microalgae are single-celled or unicellular organisms that
do not contain nuclei or membrane-bounded organelles. On the other
hand,  eukaryotic  microalgae  can  be  classified  into  organisms  which
contain  single-membrane-bound  organelles  (e.g.,  endoplasmic  reticu-
lum,  Golgi  apparatus,  lysosome,  peroxisomes  and  vacuoles)  and
double-membrane-bound organelles (including nuclei, chloroplast and
mitochondrion), however, this depends on their respective species [22,
105]. The common classification of macroalgae (also known as seaweed)
or  microalgae  can  be  grouped  into:  i)  Rhodophyta  (red  algae),  ii)
Phaeophyta (brown algae), iii) Chlorophyta (green algae), iv) Bacillar-
iophyta (diatoms) and v) Chloroxybacteria (cyanobacteria). To be spe-
cific,
of  Chloroxybacteria
(cyanobacteria), while eukaryotic microalgae include Rhodophyta (red
algae),  Phaeophyta  (brown  algae),  Chlorophyta  (Bacillariophyta)  and
Bacillariophyta (diatoms) [22,47].

prokaryotic  microalgae

consists

Eukaryotic microalgae have a structure similar to plant cells, with
organelles such as nuclei, chloroplasts and mitochondria surrounded by
a membrane. Prokaryotic microalgae possess a simple cellular structure
similar to bacteria without a nuclear membrane [104,106]. In terms of
size,  eukaryotic  microalgae  are  relatively  larger  than  prokaryotic
microalgae.  Both  types  of  microalgae  undergo  the  process  of  photo-
synthesis,  however,  chloroplasts  only  exist  in  eukaryotic  microalgae.
Prokaryotic  microalgae  have  their chlorophyll  stored  in thylakoids  in
the  cytoplasm  [107].  Eukaryotic  microalgae  include  green  algae  and
diatoms [108], while prokaryotic microalgae are commonly known as
blue-green algae or cyanobacteria [105]. The eukaryotic microalgae are
more  favorable  in  the  field  of  molecular  biotechnology  as  they  have
advantages  over  the  prokaryotic  microalgae.  Many  eukaryotic  micro-
algae carry genetic information consisting of a mixture of bacterial type,
animal  type  and  plant  type  genes  and  they  are  referred  to  as  multi-
functional ‘planimals’. Many of them can switch between phototrophic
growth  and  heterotrophic  growth  under  both  aerobic  and  anaerobic
conditions. Furthermore, harvesting eukaryotic microalgae is relatively
easier due to their larger size. Eukaryotic microalgae are also able to
perform synthesis directly in the chloroplasts or store products tempo-
rarily in the vacuoles inside the cell compartment. This increases flexi-
bility and efficiency in the aspect of design-driven biology. Lastly, green
microalgae which belong to eukaryotic domain are widely used for ge-
netic modification for biofuel production [108].

2.2.1. Use of microalgae for the production of biofuels

Algae consist mainly of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and these
elements form protein, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acid [42]. The
carbohydrates and lipids are the key biomolecules to be converted into
organic  compounds  such  as  ethylene,  propylene,  adipic  acid  and

furanics. These organic compounds are the building blocks for biofuels
[108].  Microalgae  perform  photosynthesis  by  capturing  sunlight  and
carbon  dioxide,  just  like  higher  plants.  Starch  and  lipids  are  the  key
products produced and they are the products that could be harvested for
biofuel  production.  Based  on  that,  microalgae  are  also  said  to  be  an
efficient cellular system for the harvesting of solar energy. In terms of
dry biomass, up to 60–70% lipids can be present in microalgae. Thus,
lipids in microalgae are considered as a potential feedstock for biodiesel
[23,108].

There are two ways to convert microalgal biomass into energy; these
are  thermochemical  and  biochemical  conversions.  Thermochemical
conversion is subdivided into gasification, pyrolysis, hydrogenation and
liquefaction  [109,110].  Gasification  converts  microalgal  biomass  into
combustible  gas  such  as  hydrogen,  methane,  carbon  dioxide  and
ammonia. Modified membranes and metal–organic frameworks can be
used to separate hydrogen gas from the gas stream during the process
[111,112]. Hydrogenation involves the addition of hydrogen to organic
compounds  in  microalgae  to  produce  liquid  hydrocarbons  [109,113].
Pyrolysis  converts  microalgae  into  bio-oil,  pyro  gas  and  char  in  the
absence of air [114]. If flash pyrolysis is used, the conversion of biomass
to  bio-oil  has  an  efficiency  of  up  to  80%.  Liquefaction  involves  the
conversion of wet microalgal biomass in aqueous alkali into heavy oil
[115]. Bio- and chemical conversion methods include fermentation and
transesterification. In the  fermentation method, an enzyme  is used to
convert starch to sugar, and sugar is then converted to ethanol by yeast
[116].  Transesterification  converts  fatty  acids  into  biodiesel  in  esters
form  and  glycerol  as  a  by-product  [117].  In  the  process,  methanol  is
often used as the alcohol reagent with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the
catalyst [118]. Fig. 2 shows a summary of different pathways of con-
version of microalgae to biofuels and their respective products.

2.2.2. Types of fuels produced and their applications

Most  of  the  microalgal-based  biofuels  exist  in  liquid  and  gaseous
forms. Organic compounds such as lipids and starch can be converted
into gaseous biofuels (e.g. biogas and biohydrogen) and liquid biofuels
(e.g. biodiesel and bioethanol) [119].

2.2.2.1. Gaseous  biofuels  from  microalgae. Gaseous  biofuels  mainly
consist of methane, carbon dioxide and biohydrogen [113]. These gases
can  be  used  directly  for  combustion  in  gas  engines  or  gas  turbines.
Biohydrogen consists of majorly hydrogen gas with a mixture of other
gases.  Hydrogen  gas  tops  the  energy  content  per  unit  weight  of  any
known fuel with an energy density of around 142 kJ/g [120]. Hydrogen
fuel cells have three times higher efficiency than gasoline fuel, but high
purity  of  hydrogen  gas  is  required  as  feedstock.  Thus,  hydrogen  gas
separation and purification needs to be done in the case of biohydrogen
production  [120,121].  Microalgae  are  capable  of  producing  bio-
hydrogen by adjusting their metabolism during their cultivation. There
are  several  ways  to  produce  biohydrogen  from  microalgae,  including
dark  fermentation,  photo-fermentation,  direct  and  indirect  photolysis
[122,123]. Fig. 3 shows an illustration of these processes. By conducting
an  in-depth  study,  the  production  of  biohydrogen  from  microalgae,
using the aforementioned processes, can be further improved to make
them commercially viable.

2.2.2.2. Liquid biofuels from microalgae. Microalgae contain significant
concentrations  of  several  carbohydrates,  including  starch,  glycogen,
agar, and cellulose, which are easily converted to fermentable sugars for
the  production  of  bioethanol.  These  algae-based  liquid  biofuels  are
majorly  used  in  transportation  industry  as  their  high-octane  number
prevents  knocking  and  lowers  the  emission  of  greenhouse  gases.
Therefore,  most  of  this  algae-based  bioethanol  can  either  be  directly
used  in  cars  or  blended  with  petroleum-based  gasoline  [124].  Some
years ago, the global use of bioethanol increased dramatically, from 1 to
39 billion liters. Brazil and the USA are the dominant industrial players

accounting  for  over  80%  of  total  production  [125].  Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii  and  Chlorella  vulgaris
species  of  microalgae  are
carbohydrate-rich and can be used in the techno-economic assessment
(TEA) for the production of bioethanol. TEA of microalgae-based bio-
ethanol  production  calculates  the  plant’s  appropriateness  in  terms  of
total investment, total cost, and total net profit [126]. Companies such
as  Seambiotic,  Algenol  and  Sapphire  Energy  produce  bioethanol  on
commercial scale with an annual output of 1 billion gallons at a cost of
85 cents/L [127].

Biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) which can
from  pyrolysis,

from  hydrocarbons  or  bio-oil

be  synthesized

liquefaction,  hydrogenation  and  transesterification  [128].  Bio-oil  has
high water content which reduces the viscosity and enhances the fluidity
which is good for atomization and combustion. However, the high-water
content  can  also  reduce  the  heating  value  and  flame  temperature.
Therefore, further purification is needed to improve the heating value in
biodiesel.  Biodiesel  has  similar  engine  performance  compared  to  pe-
troleum diesel with provided advantageous such as lower sulphur and
particulate matter emissions [118,129]. Microalgae can produce 58,700
L of algal oil per hectare from which 121,104 L of biodiesel per hectare
can be produced [130]. Certain microalgal species are advantageous for
the production of biodiesel because they are likely to contain high levels

of lipids (50–80%), such as Botryococcus braunii, which has up to 80% oil
in its biomass [55]. It has been reported that microalgae-derived bio-
diesel  exhibits  several  characteristics  similar  to  petroleum-derived
diesel,  including flash point,  density, viscosity, solidifying point,  cold
filter plugging point, and heating value. The majority of these factors are
within the biodiesel quality standards set by the American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM) [131]. Therefore, algae-based biodiesel
can be used directly as a fuel with 100% purity or a blended mixture of
gasoline fuel. For instance, flex-fuel engines in Brazil can perform duty
with all ethanol, all gasoline or any mixture of both as fuel [132]. While
in the USA, flex-fuel engines can run on fuel consisting of up to 85%
ethanol.

2.2.3. Significance of microalgae in producing biofuel compared to other
sources

Chisti [131] predicted that microalgae-based feedstock has the po-
tential and capacity to replace fossil fuel sources and meet the global oil
requirement.  From  the  environmental  perspective,  producing  biofuel
from  microalgae  has  several  advantages  such  as  a  high  microalgal
growth  rate,  high  energy  yield  and  small  land  area  usage  [133].  As
compared to other biomass sources, microalgae have a high yield per
unit of area and light required for their cultivation [134,135]. They do
not need fresh water and have the capability to utilize nutrients from
wastewater  [136].  Although  the  first-generation  of  biofuel  feedstocks
have been commercialized with matured technologies, the drawbacks
associated with the sustainability of the food resources remain a critical
issue. First-generation biofuel feedstocks are mostly food crops acting as
biofuel feedstocks which increase the price of agricultural commodities.
Increasing demand for these food crops also causes intensive usage of
fertilizers  and  agrochemicals  which  degrade  water  and  soil  quality
[137]. On the other hand, microalgae-based biofuel production can be
cultivated in closed photobioreactors or open raceway ponds and does
not require arable and productive land [118]. From a socio-economic
perspective, the production cycle of microalgal biofuel does not affect
the  human  food  chain  supply  system  directly  and  food  against  fuel
conflict  can  be  avoided  [138].  In  addition,  microalgal  biofuel  can  be
produced domestically which will reduce the dependency of a country
on foreign oil, creating job opportunities and uplifting the local econ-
omy  at  the  same  time [139]. As  shown in  Table  3,  the  cultivation of
microalgae does not require a large area of land compared to the culti-
vation of terrestrial plant sources.

Microalgae can double their biomass concentration every 2–5 days
which is a significant advantage against other feedstocks which take a
longer time to grow [24]. Besides, microalgal biomass can be harvested
batch-wise or continuously almost all year round compared to the first-
and second-generation feedstocks which can only be harvested once or
twice a year [33,138]. Thereby, the continuous production of microalgal
biomass would largely compensate for the harvesting and transportation
costs  of  microalgal  biofuel  production  over  conventional  feedstocks
[140,141]. Looking at its energy yield, microalgal oil yield is five times

yield [142]. The calorific value of bio-oil from microalgae is about 1.4
times that of wood due to lower oxygen contents [143]. Microalgae do
not  contain  lignin  and  have  low  hemicellulose  levels,  this  results  in
increased  hydrolysis  and  fermentation  efficiencies  and  yields  [144].
Apart from biofuel, various co-products that are non-toxic, biodegrad-
able and valuable such as soap and glycerine can also be produced from
microalgae  [118].  For  detailed  information  concerning  the  compre-
hensive  compilation  of  lipid  content  and  biomass  production  from
various marine and freshwater microalgae species, readers are suggested
to refer to a published work by Mata et al. [55].

2.2.4. Genetic engineering of microalgae for enhanced lipid production

To produce biofuels from microalgae, the aim is to produce hydro-
carbons that have similar physical and chemical properties as diesel and
kerosene from crude oil. As lipid has the highest energy content with
37.6  kJ/g  in  microalgae,  the  lipid  is  seen  as  a  promising  source  for
biodiesel  production  [145–147].  However,  there  is  speculation  about
whether  lipid  from  microalgae  is  sufficient  to  provide  renewable

biofuels for replacing fossil fuels. Biofuel production from microalgae
can  be  relatively  expensive  at  the  moment.  Therefore,  improving
microalgal lipid production and quality could further improve the eco-
nomics  of  biofuel  production.  Traditional  ways  to  improve  lipid  pro-
ductivity  include  culture  conditions,  chemical  additives  and  applying
stress. Currently, engineering approaches, which involve the modifica-
tion of genetic and metabolic properties of microalgae, are gaining more
attention  due  to  genetic  and  biochemical  diversity  of  microalga  as
demonstrated in literature [147,148].

The  algae  industry  has  currently  reached  a  few  milestones  in  the
engineering of microalgae cells. These include nuclear transformation,
gene  isolation,  transformation,  and  whole-genome  sequencing  [27].
Although  genetic  engineering  has  yet  to  be  proven  to  cause  over-
production  of  lipids  in  microalgae,  the  approach  has  built  up  a  solid
concept about the biosynthetic pathway of the types of fatty acids fav-
oured in biofuel production [149]. The concept is generally applicable to
most of the species, but there are variations in the structure of key en-
zymes and the location of reactions. The results are building up a strong
foundation for further development of the genetic engineering approach
in microalgae to enhance lipid production [146].

3. Lipid production: type of lipids produced in microalgae

In microalgal cells, lipids can be found in the form of droplets, stored
in cellular membranes and organelles. There are two classes of lipids in
microalgae, polar and non-polar lipids [150]. The distribution of these
lipids varies  as  it depends  on the  growth phases  of  microalgae. Polar
lipids are also known as structural lipids and they are key components
found in organelle membranes (e.g. thylakoid membranes) of the chlo-
roplasts [151]. Glycolipids and phospholipids are common polar lipids
found in the cell membrane which aid in protecting and maintaining the
shape  of  the  cell  [152].  Each  phospholipid  molecule  has  a  polar  hy-
drophilic  head  and  two  hydrophobic  acid  tails,  which  could  be  pure
saturated  tails  or  a  mixture  of  saturated  and  unsaturated  tails.  Some
polar lipids are also responsible for signaling and reacting to changes in
the surroundings [145].

Non-polar lipids are also known as neutral lipids or storage lipids.
Common  neutral  lipids  are  triacylglycerols  (TAGs),  diacylglycerols
(DAGs), monoacylglycerols (MAGs), free fatty acids (FFAs), hydrocar-
bons and other pigments [153]. The TAGs are key components in energy
production and storage as they undergo catabolism to supply metabolic
energy. TAGs are synthesized in the presence of light and accumulated
in cytosolic lipid bodies [154]. TAGs can also be used for the synthesis of
polar  lipids  in  dark  conditions.  Most  microalgae  do  not  accumulate
many TAGs during exponential growth, but rather they are accumulated
quickly during the stationary phase [155].

Different fatty acid compounds can be found in different species of
algae. Generally, polar lipids are made up of polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs), while non-polar lipids are made up of monounsaturated fatty
acids (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SAFAs) [145,146]. Microalgae
are also the primary producers of important fatty acids such as omega-3
fatty  acids  and  omega-6  fatty  acids.  Among  all  fatty  acids,  TAGs  are
usually found in in different species of microalgae [147] and are ready to
be converted into biodiesel by the transesterification process [156].

Microalgae generate lipids during photosynthesis and most of their
composition include unsaturated fatty acids, mainly palmitoleic (16:1),
oleic (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2) [157]. Saturated fatty acids can be
found in the form of stearic acid (18:0). Chrypthecodinium cohnii is found
to generate a large quantity of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as do-
cosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a ω-3 fatty acid (22:6ω3) which is composed
of 28.0% (w/w dry cell weight) of total lipid content (separation ach-
ieved up to 91.6% DHA, 88.2% of saturated and monounsaturated fatty
acid  ethyl  ester,  respectively)  [158].  Table  4  summarises  the  type  of
lipids  found  in  microalgae  and  their  respective  key  components  and
functions.

Lipid feedstocks of biodiesel consist of 90–98% (by weight) of TAGs

and  other  components  including  small  amounts  of  mono  and  di-
glycerides,  free  fatty  acids  and  residues  of  phospholipids,  sulphur
compounds,  phosphatides,  carotenes  and  water  [159,160].  The  fuel
properties  of  biodiesel  from  microalgal  lipid  depend  greatly  on  the
composition of fatty acids. The biodiesel produced from microalgal oil,
which is low in saturated fatty acid content, has better fuel properties at
colder temperatures as saturated fatty acids can drastically increase the
pour and cloud point of biodiesel. However, biodiesel with high unsat-
urated compounds gets oxidized easier than normal diesel. This results
in insoluble sediments and deposits, that will interfere with the working
of the engine [145].

3.1. Lipid production mechanism in microalgae

In  “light”  photosynthesis,  microalgae  use  light  irradiation  to  split
water  into  oxygen,  protons  and  electrons,  while  in  “dark”  photosyn-
thesis, protons and electrons are utilized to reduce carbon dioxide into
starch by the Calvin cycle. Starch can be catabolized to form lipids in the
form of fatty acids and TAGs [145,156,170]. Energy is stored as starch
which  provides  energy  for  crucial  metabolic  processes  without  extra
energy  sources.  Neutral  lipids  such  as  TAGs  function  as  a  secondary
source  of  energy  and  accumulate  at  every  stage  of  the  growth  of
microalgae, but with the highest accumulation rate during the station-
ary  phase.  The  production  and  accumulation  of  starch  and  lipids  are
similar to buffer mechanisms, which allow cells to cope with different
growth conditions and varying light intensity. As energy from starch is
the primary source for metabolism in microalgae cells, lipids that act as a
secondary source have less energy output and accumulate more energy.
By yield from complete oxidation, lipids provide 35 kJ/g, which is more
than that of starch which provides 17 kJ/g [171]. Therefore, blocking
metabolic pathways that produce starch and other energetic compounds
is a strategy to increase TAGs content [172].

According to Vitova et al. [171], starch in green algae is exclusively
stored in chloroplasts and neutral lipids, and is mostly found in struc-
tures called lipid bodies in the cytoplasm, as well as in the chloroplasts.
Lipid  bodies  are  organelles  that  mainly  consist  of  neutral  lipids  sur-
rounded by a single layer of phospholipids and some proteins. Besides
storing lipids, these proteins also regulate the synthesis and transport
lipids to the membranes of other organelles [173]. The distributions of
starch  and  lipids  differ  depending  on  strain,  growth  conditions  and
external stress. Some studies have reported that under optimal growth
conditions, algae biomass can increase significantly, but the lipid con-
tents  are  relatively  low,  which  range  from  5  to  20%  of  the  dry  cell
weight. However, when given favorable environmental or stress condi-
tions, the formation and accumulation of lipids, particularly TAGs, in
microalgae are found to improve as a result of the altered lipid biosyn-
thetic pathways, to cope with the unusual conditions. Increasing TAGs
can lead to alterations in the composition of fatty acids and other lipids
in microalgae [174].

the

into  malonyl-CoA  by

Lipids can be biosynthesized in three locations via a de novo pathway.
Fatty  acids  are  synthesized  in  chloroplasts,  while  TAG  in  the  endo-
plasmic reticulum and thylakoids [175]. CoA denotes coenzyme A, and
ACP denotes acyl carrier protein. The process starts with the conversion
of  acetyl-CoA
reaction  between
acetyl-CoA-carboxylase  and  bicarbonate  ion.  Next,  malonyl-CoA  is
converted  into  malonyl-ACP  by  transacylase.  Then,  malonyl-ACP  is
converted into 3-ketoacyl-ACP by a synthase enzyme in the next stage
and restarts the fatty acid cycle. Finally, thioesterase catalyzes the hy-
drolysis of the acyl-ACP thioester bond to produce free fatty acids and
acyl  groups  [176].  The  free  fatty  acids  generated  are  either  used  to
synthesize cellular lipids or glycerols which are the building blocks of
TAGs. Enzymes involved in the process could be different based on gene
expression levels. Alternate sources of acyl groups other than acyl-CoA
and acyl-ACP could be phospholipids [172,177]. Fig. 4 shows a sche-
matic diagram illustrating the process of lipid production in microalgal
cells.

3.2. Factors affecting lipid production in microalgae

This section discusses various factors and parameters such as light
intensity,  temperature,  required  nutrients,  supply  of  carbon  dioxide,
system pH and salinity that usually influence the microalgal cultivation.
In most cases, some strains may require stress treatment (e.g. nutrient
limitation or depletion) to overproduce lipids and some strains may be
affected by external factors such as temperature or other environmental
factors for enhanced lipids production.

3.2.1. Light intensity

Since microalgae are capable of performing photosynthesis, light is a
crucial parameter affecting lipid production. Biodiesel is composed of
non-polar lipids, particularly TAGs [178]. The production of non-polar
lipids is  promoted by  low  intensity of  light, as  polar lipids content is
reduced under low light intensity to protect the photosystem [40]. It has
been found that increasing light intensity will promote the synthesis of
oxidizing  agents  (i.e.,  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  and  oxidative
stress) which damage polyunsaturated fatty acids [179], thus reducing
the polar lipids content and as a result, the content of non-polar lipids
will increase [180]. In other words, the accumulation of lipids requires

optimum  conditions  in  which  high  light  intensities  (above  saturation
level) may trigger photoinhibition and lead to cessation of starch syn-
thesis  and  low  lipid  productivity  [181,182].  However,  very  low  light
intensity (or heterotrophic condition) might cut-off both starch and lipid
synthesis  [171,183].  Therefore,  the  optimum  light  intensity  for  the
growth of most microalgae species is within the range of 200–400 μmol
(cid:0) 1 [184]. For Scenedesmus obliquus, Nzayisenga et al. [185]
photons m
reported that fatty acids content doubled from 5.8% to 11.6% under a
(cid:0) 1. Another study showed that
light intensity of 300 μmol photons m
both Chlorella sp. and Monoraphidium sp. had increased neutral  lipids
(cid:0) 1 light intensity
content when cultivated below 400 μmol photons m
[186].

The cultivation of microalgae under mixotrophic condition involves
the  cycles  of  light  and  dark  reactions. Under  this  condition,  the  light
reaction cycle undergoes the conversion of light energy into chemical
energy  which  primarily  occurs  in  thylakoids  (membrane-bound  com-
partments).  During  the  dark  reaction  cycle,  the  chemical  energy  is
further  transformed  into  stable  chemical  energy  [187,188].  As  this
light/dark  cycle  period  persists  simultaneously,  it  may  influence  the
microalgal  photosynthetic  process  unit  turnover  time,  therefore  a
maximum photosynthetic efficiency can be attained under this growth

condition [189]. Additionally, variable light intensities and light–dark
cycles  have  been  shown to  change the  lipid profile  in microalgae  via
changing the metabolism of lipids. Triacylglycerides are produced in the
presence of light, and various species require varying light intensities. In
addition, the composition of triacylglycerides varies depending on the
species  and  the  amount  of  light  exposure.  To  summarize,  light  often
promotes the production of fatty acids, growth, and the development of
membranes, especially chloroplast membranes [190].

In order to fully utilize microalgae as a feedstock for the production
of biodiesel, several aspects such as biomass growth and lipid produc-
tivity must be taken into consideration. The capacity of microalgae to
biosynthesize lipids is influenced by a variety of factors, and the rela-
tionship  between  light  intensity  and  production  is  important.  The
studies  with  continuous  illumination  (i.e.  autotrophic  growth  mode)
demonstrated  that  lipid  formation  is  increased  by  strong  continuous
light [191]. Algal lipid synthesis has been hypothesized to be influenced
by light intensity, with intense illumination leading to their build-up. It
was  revealed  that  switching  from  low  light  to  high  light  conditions
boosted  lipid  accumulation  in  Haematococcus  pluvialis  species  as  well
[192]. A study by Wahidin et al. [193] examined the lipid production at
different  light/dark  cycles  at  a  uniform  light  intensity  for  Nanno-
chloropsis sp. The highest percentage of total lipids (31.3%) was attained
when the culture was exposed to 18 h of light and 6 h of darkness, on day
eight  of  cultivation.  While,  at  24:0  light,  the  total  lipid  content  was
substantially lower (27.95%) as compared to 18:06 light/dark cycles at
(cid:0) 2s-1. The lipid content further
an identical light intensity of 100 μmol m
decreased to 25.59% because of the photoperiod cycle of 12 h light, 12 h
dark.  The  findings  showed  that  a  high  lipid  content  typically  corre-
sponds to faster biomass growth rates.

Light penetration and angle of incidence also has a strong effect on
microalgal cells. Generally, only 7–10 cm of water at the top level of the
water  column  experiences  enough  light  penetration  for  efficient
photosynthesis. Therefore, the microalgal cells in the deeper parts do not
receive  enough  natural  light  [40].  This  can  be  resolved  by  using  a
photobioreactor  during  cultivation  [180].  Under  ideal  conditions,  a
photobioreactor should be able to capture all the available light from the
surroundings  of  the  system  and  supply  it  to  the  culture  [194].  It  is
suggested  to  provide  sufficient  mixing  using  a  magnetic  stirrer  or  an
airstone aerator to enhance light distribution in the culture medium. The
chlorophyll  of  microalgae  absorbs  light  spectrum  bands  in  regions  of
blue and red. Therefore, providing the light radiation that lies in those
wavelength regions could improve the rate of photosynthesis and lipid
productivity, as well as reduce energy consumption if not using sunlight
as the source. A study reported that blue light promotes the synthesis of
enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase and ribulose biphosphate carbox-
ylase, which helps in lipid production [178]. Besides, the composition of
lipids  by  weight  in  dry  biomass  of  Chlorella  sp.  was  also  found  to  be
doubled when cultivated under red light [40].

3.2.2. Temperature

Temperature affects metabolic processes such as photosynthetic rate,
growth and lipid accumulation in microalgae [195]. Most microalgae
are capable of producing lipids in the temperature range between 15 and
◦
40
C. The most favourable temperature range for microalgal growth is
◦

However, it is difficult and costly to regulate the temperature in outdoor
conditions.  The  evaporation  of  medium,  overheating  and  cooling  in
outdoor conditions, and lipid composition are some of the significant
obstacles for algal growth, in addition to the severe temperatures. Ac-
cording  to  Chaisutyakorn  et  al.  [195],  higher  temperatures  cause  the
accumulation of saturated lipids whereas lower temperatures cause the
accumulation  of  unsaturated  lipids.  On  the  other  hand,  numerous  re-

3.2.3. Nutrients: nitrogen and phosphorus macronutrients

Besides carbon and oxygen, microalgal cells also consist of nitrogen
and phosphorus compounds. Nitrogen and phosphorus are macronutri-
ents,  required  for  microalgal  growth.  Nitrogen  can  be  obtained  from
urea and nitrates while phosphorus can be obtained from phosphates
[199]. Nitrogen-deficient conditions have been shown to promote lipid
biosynthesis  by  affecting  other  biochemical  pathways  in  microalgae
[200].  According  to  Hess  et  al.  [147],  nitrogen  starvation  alters  the
cellular carbon metabolism from protein to lipid synthesis and also the
fatty  acid  composition  by  promoting  the  production  of  saturated  and
monounsaturated fatty acids. Shi et al. [180] suggested that the degra-
dation  of  nitrogenous  compounds  such  as  chlorophylls  and  proteins
results in more carbon and energy available for lipid accumulation.

On the other hand, phosphorus also affects carbon flow between the
synthetic pathways of starch and lipids by inhibiting the activity of ADP-
glucose  pyrophosphorylase,  an  enzyme  committed  in  the  first  step  of
starch synthesis [201]. This reduces the activity of starch synthesis, thus
shifting the metabolic flux toward lipid accumulation [180]. Therefore,
nitrogen  and  phosphorus  starvations  are  commonly  used  to  promote
lipid production in microalgae. A study using Neochloris oleoabundans
microalgae,  cultivated  under  nitrogen-deprived  conditions  reported
(cid:0) 1,  which  was  almost  2-fold
TAG  productivity  of  46.19  mg  L
(cid:0) 1) [202]. Yang et al.
compared to initial productivity (23.47 mg L
[203]  tested  Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii  under  nitrogen  deprivation
conditions  and  different  concentrations  of  phosphorus.  Both  nitrogen
and  phosphorus deprivation conditions yielded  the highest  total fatty
acid (TFA) content of 105 μg/mg, which was 104.7% higher than the
control.  Other  micronutrients  such  as  potassium,  cobalt,  manganese,
iron and zinc are needed in small amounts only, but can significantly
affect the growth by triggering enzymatic activities [204].

3.2.4. Carbon dioxide

Carbon is the main element in microalgal cells, which can represent
50%  of  the  microalgal  biomass.  The  content  of  elemental  carbon  de-
termines growth conditions as well as the carbon sequestration rate. In
most  cases,  the  CO2  requirement  in  the  cultivation  of  microalgae  is
about 2% (v/v) of CO2 with an aeration gas mixture, yet this depends on
case-to-case  basis.  Carbon  dioxide and  bicarbonate ions  are  preferred
sources  of  inorganic  carbon  for  microalgae.  Variation  in  carbon  con-
centration also affects the fatty acid composition and saturation [145].
With a 15% increment in CO2 concentration, some strains generate more
long-chain fatty acids such as C18:0, C18:1 and C20:0 [178]. Uniform
distribution of  carbon dioxide can be achieved by  providing constant
mixing. Increasing CO2 aeration has been proven to enhance lipid con-
tent in microalgae [205]. When CO2 concentration increased to 15% in a
photobioreactor with blue light, Chorella vulgaris and Gloeothece mem-
branacea yielded lipid content of 25.6% and 36%, respectively [205].
Another study on Scenedesmus dimorphus was conducted under different
CO2  concentrations  and  nitrogen:  phosphorus  (N:P)  ratios.  The  lipid
(cid:0) 1  and maximum lipid content of
(cid:0) 1  d
productivity peaked at 6.6 mg L
31.6% dry weight (DW) of biomass was achieved, at 6% CO2 in supplied
air and N:P ratio of 1:1 [206]. On the other hand, considering the supply
of  CO2  in  large-scale  cultivation  may  incur  an  increase  in  the  cost of
biomass. Therefore, it is suggested to build an algal plant and valorize
free sources of CO2 from nearby local industry (e.g., biogas plant, lime

works and power station).

3.2.5. pH and salinity

The pH plays an important role in carbon supply, algal growth as
well  as  in  the  species  diversity  in  mixed  cultures  [207].  The  pH  can
fluctuate  during day and  night  in closed cultures, as  bicarbonate and
carbon dioxide consumption for photosynthesis during the day shifts the
pH of the medium to alkaline, while the production of carbon dioxide
during respiration at night shifts the pH to acidic [147,208]. The most
favorable pH range for microalgal growth lies between pH values 6 to
8.76.  Most  species  are  sensitive  to  pH  change,  but  species  such  as
Chorella vulgaris can survive a broad range of pH. Variation in pH can
affect  the  cell  growth  and  lipid  accumulation  [209].  Species  such  as
Chlorella  sp.,  Nannochloropsis  salina  and  Pavlova  lutheri  were found  to
have optimum growth at pH 8, with lipid content of 23%, 24.75% and
35%,  respectively  [210,211].  According  to  BenMoussa-Dahmen  et  al.
[212], Amphora subtropica and Dunaliella sp. had optimum growth at pH
9 and 10, respectively. Under optimized parameters, lipid content was
found  to  increase  from  150  to  190  g  lipid  kg-1  biomass  in  Amphora
subtropica  while  lipid  content  increased  from  190  to  280  g  lipid  kg-1
biomass in Dunaliella sp. microalgae.

Salinity  stress  is  also  a  strategy  to  improve  lipid  production  in
microalgae. Under conditions with high salinity stress (the lipid content
enhanced  from  60  to  70%  by  increasing  the  sodium  chloride  (NaCl)
concentration from 0.5 to 1.0 M, for Chlorella vulgaris), carbon distri-
bution  is  likely  to  shift  from  starch  to  lipids  synthesis.  Under  high
salinity stress conditions, lipids content increased while the starch and
protein content decreased. As reported, the lipid content increased from
60 to 70% when the concentration of NaCl increased from 0.5 to 1.0 M
[156,213]. It is because of the upregulation of ACCase (the main enzyme
responsible for lipid synthesis) and the downregulation of AGPase (the
main enzyme for the synthesis of starch) [180]. High pH also promotes
the  production  of  more  saturated  fatty  acids.  However,  the  optimal
range of pH and salinity varies between the microalgae strains and their
specific needs to determine their respective lipid productivity.

Ho  et  al.  [214]  reported  that  carbon  distribution  is  shifted  from
starch  to  lipids  synthesis  under  salinity  stress.  Results  have  shown  a
13.5-fold increase and a 10.5-fold increase in mRNA levels of enzymes
responsible for starch degradation and lipid synthesis, respectively. It is
also reported that up to a 56.9% increase in lipid content, along with a
decrease in starch content is obtained. Rai et al. [209] studied the effect
of salinity on Chlorella sp. by growing the microalgae in different con-
centrations of NaCl (0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.1 M). The lipid production
increased with NaCl concentration from 0.0 M to 0.5 M, and peaked at
(cid:0) 1, then decreased at 0.8
0.5 M NaCl with lipid production of 0.1842 g L
M and 1.1 M. The lipid content at 0.5 M was 7.93% higher than 0.0 M
(control). Shah et al. [211] reported that the lipid content of Pavlova
lutheri increased with the concentration of NaCl in the range of 15–35
ppt, which peaked at 35 ppt with lipid content of 36%, then decreased to
34%  at  NaCl  of  40  ppt.  Various  factors  affecting  lipid  production  in
microalgae are shown in Table 5.

3.3. Methods for lipids extraction from microalgae

The lipid extraction process from microalgae refers to the separation
of the desired neutral lipids and fatty acids from the cells and culture
medium [218]. Microalgae have complex and strong cell walls made of
polysaccharides and proteins. Prior to the lipid extraction, a suitable cell
disruption process or pretreatment is necessary depending on the cell
type [23]. After cell disruption, the lipid extraction process is carried out
using  solvents  as  the  conventional  method  for  lipid  extraction  from
microalgae. This section will evaluate various conventional and recent
advanced strategies available for lipid extraction from microalgae. An
overview of the upstream and downstream processing of microalgae is
illustrated in Fig. 5.

3.3.1. Conventional mechanical methods

Conventional mechanical methods involve the use of a solid physical
surface to disrupt or pretreat the cell wall of the microalgae. The com-
mon conventional mechanical methods are expeller press, grinding and
beat beating. While, the recent mechanical methods involve microwave,
ultrasound, osmotic pressure and pulsed electricity methods. This sec-
tion  will  discuss  in  detail  each  of  these  methods  and  respective
mechanisms.

3.3.1.1. Expeller press and grinding. This is a traditional method similar
to extracting oil from seeds and crops where high mechanical pressure is
applied  to  microalgae  [219].  This  can  disrupt  the  cell  wall  and  also
squeeze out the lipids directly. Extraction yield increases with pressure,
but too much pressure can lead to the downgrading of extracted oil due
to the heat generated. If there is high heat generated during the process,
cooling is needed, and this will increase operational costs. Moreover, it is
reported that colour pigments are extracted along with the extracted oil,
thus  removing  them  incurs  additional  costs  [220,221].  Zheng  et  al.
[222] reported a lipid extraction efficiency of 29% from Chlorella vul-
garis after grinding the cells with liquid nitrogen. Kim et al. [223] ob-
tained a lipid extraction efficiency of 60.1% from Scenedesmus sp. before
solvent extraction. With expeller press, Topare et al. [220] obtained a

3.3.1.2. Bead beating. Bead beating disrupts the cell by treating biomass
slurry together with fine beads spinning at high speed to grind the cells.
There are two types of bead mills: shaking vessels and agitated beads. In
the  shaking  vessel,  the  entire  culture  vessel  is  shaken  to  damage  the
cells. Normally, more than one vessel will be used to enhance disruption.
In the agitated type, the cell culture is agitated with beads. The second
type has more effective disruption on the cells as it combines the effects
of agitation, collision and grinding of the beads. The beads can be made
from zirconia-silica, titanium carbide or zirconium oxide and the ideal
bead diameter is 0.5 mm [219]. Zheng et al. [222] obtained a lipid yield
of around 10% dry weight (DW) from Chorella vulgaris by beating with
beads of diameter ranging from 0.40 to 0.60 mm with a rate of 1500 rpm
for 20 min. Alavijeh et al. [224] combined bead beating and enzyme
hydrolysis to extract lipid from Chorella vulgaris. The lipid yields were
found to be 0.05 and 0.06 g lipid/g biomass for biomass treated with
protease and lipase, respectively, after bead beating.

3.3.2. Recent advanced mechanical methods

3.3.2.1. Microwave-assisted  pretreatment. Microwave  electromagnetic
radiation lies in the range of frequency of 0.3–300 GHz. It can resonate
the  polar  components  such  as  water  molecules  and  this  damages  the
algal cell membrane as well as generating heat. This method can be used
to treat both wet and dry microalgal biomass, but with better perfor-
mance on wet biomass. This is a method that only causes cell disruption,
and  solvent  treatment  is  needed  afterward  [42,221].  Nogueira  et  al.
[225] obtained a lipid recovery of around 24.2% in Chaetoceros calci-
trans with microwave pretreatment. Rokicka et al. [226] used the mi-
crowave as a pre-treatment for lipid extraction from Botryococcus braunii
and  Chorella  vulgaris.  The  lipid  yields  were  obtained  as  56.42%  and
41.31% for Botryococcus braunii and Chorella vulgaris, respectively.

3.3.2.2. Ultrasound-assisted  pretreatment. This  method  applies  sound
waves of frequency above 20 kHz to the culture medium, generating a
cycle of alternating compression and rarefaction, which are parts with
high  pressure  and  low  pressure,  respectively.  This  method  aims  to
disrupt the cytoplasm of cells and release lipid molecules. One of the
advantages of using this method is the process of cavitating cytoplasm
with  ultrasonic  waves  [42,221].  Before  extraction  with  the  solvent
mixture, Ido et al. [227] treated Scenedesmus obliquus by ultrasonication
and the overall recovery yield of the extraction was found to be 26.63%
by  weight.  Rokicka  et  al.  [226]  used  ultrasonication  on  Botryococcus

braunii  and  Chorella  vulgaris  and  obtained  lipid  yields  of  39.61%  and
35.28%, respectively. In another study conducted by Gonz ́alez-Balderas
et al. [228], ca. 73% lipid recovery was achieved from Desmodesmus sp.
biomass when ultrasound was used as pre-treatment before extraction.
Fig. 6 shows the pretreatment before and after ultrasound-assisted pre-
treatment  and  the  mechanism  involved  during  the  cavitation  process
produced by the ultrasound.

3.3.2.3. Osmotic pressure method. This method alters the osmotic pres-
sure  by  altering  the  salt  concentration  in  the  culture  media  to  levels
much  higher or much lower than the normal level. The imbalance of
osmotic pressure between regions inside and outside of the microalgal
cells  disrupts  the  cell  walls.  This  method  can  be  achieved  by  hyper-
osmotic and hypo-osmotic conditions. Hyper-osmotic refers to the con-
dition where the exterior of the cell has a higher salt concentration. The
fluids diffuse out from the cell and cause the cell to shrink, damaging cell
envelopes. While hypo-osmotic refers to the condition where the exte-
rior of the cell has a lower salt concentration, causing the fluid to diffuse
into the cell and resulting in the cell to burst if the stress is too high
[219]. Yoo et al. [232] used osmotic shock to treat wet Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii biomass for lipid extraction. After treating with sorbitol and
NaCl as osmotic agents for 7 days, the final lipid yields were found to be
5.96 and 6.67 mg/L, respectively, which represented a lipid recovery of
9.06  and  34.5%,  respectively.  Gonz ́alez-Gonz ́alez  et  al.  [228]  tested
osmotic  shock  as  pre-treatment  on  Dunaliella  salina  and  Chaetoceros
muelleri, and the results showed that this treatment was more effective
on Chaetoceros muelleri than Dunaliella salina. After treatment with os-
motic  shock,  lipid  recoveries  for  Chaetoceros  muelleri  and  Dunaliella
salina  were  noted  as  72%  and  21%,  respectively.  Fig.  7  shows  the
diffusion of fluid concept for isomostic, hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic
conditions of the microalgae cell.

3.3.2.4. Pulsed
electro-
field-assisted
permeabilization. This  cell  disruption  method  is  used  to  create  micro-
pores at the cell membrane by applying short electric pulses with a large
electric  field  force.  It  is  also  known  as  electroporation  or  electro-
immobilization.  This  method  has  been  successfully  used  to  extract
lipid molecules from Chlorella vulgaris [233]. The study also showed that
higher exposure time leads to higher lipid yield. However, this method

or

requires a large amount of energy and costs, thus it is not feasible for
large-scale applications [42]. Silve et al. [234] applied PEF on Auxeno-
chlorella  protothecoides  cultivated  mixotrophically  and  autotrophically
before solvent extraction. Lipid recovery was found to be 97% and 90%,
respectively, after 20 h of extraction. Papachristou et al. [235] observed
up  to  83%  of  lipid  recovery  from  Scendesmus  almeriensis  with  PEF
applied before solvent extraction. Fig. 8 shows the pretreatment before
and after pulsed electric field-assisted pretreatment and the mechanisms
involved during the permeabilization process produced by the electric
field. Table 6 summarizes the recent advances in mechanical methods
used in microalgal lipid extraction.

3.3.3. Advanced chemical methods for lipid extraction

Advanced chemical methods for lipid extraction involve techniques
such as supercritical carbon dioxide (SC–CO2), enzymatic biocatalysis,
use of engineered nanoparticles, bio-based solvents, ionic liquids (ILs),
switchable solvents and deep eutectic solvents. Each of these respective
extraction  methods  requires  an  optimization  procedure  in  order  to
obtain  high  lipid  productivity.  Most  of  these  chemical  methods  will
implement green and environmental-friendly solvents for the recovery
of lipids from microalgae biomass.

◦

3.3.3.1. Supercritical carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide achieves a super-
critical state at 72 bar and 32
C [42]. In this state, it possesses solvent
properties of liquid and mass transfer properties of gas, which means a
greater  diffusion  coefficient  [243].  Its  selectivity  towards  non-polar
lipids can be further enhanced by using it with polar co-solvents such
as toluene, methanol and ethanol. The polar co-solvents aid in delinking
the bond between non-polar lipids and polar lipids, so more non-polar
lipids  can  be  extracted  by  supercritical  carbon  dioxide  [218].  Lor-
enzen et al. [243] performed extraction with CO2 at 120 bar and 20
C
on Scenedesmus obliquus and obtained 92% of the total lipids. The yield
obtained by Obeid et al. [244] from Chlorella vulgaris was up to 97%
when  treated  with  supercritical  CO2  at  450  bar  and  50
C,  with  the
addition of co-solvent ethanol (10% v/v). Supercritical carbon dioxide is
gaining more attention as a greener solvent compared to conventional
organic solvents based on VOCs. It has higher selectivity  towards the
desired non-polar lipids and poses greener characteristics such as lower
toxicity, negligible environmental effects and inert chemical properties,

production chain. This method has been commercially available due to
its wide applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries.

papain  and  pectinase  as  enzymes  for  three-phase  partitioning  and  it
yielded 92.59% of FAMEs in Nannochloropsis oculata.

3.3.3.2. Enzymes. Enzymes are useful biocatalysts as they can bind to
specific  molecules  in  the  cell  wall  and  hydrolyze  the  bonds  causing
membrane  rupture  in  the  process  of  lipid  extraction  [245].  Recent
research  has  focused  on  the  application  of  different  enzymes  such  as
chitinases, pectinase, amylase, cellulose and lysozyme on Chlorella vul-
garis  for  lipid  extraction  [246].  Chitinases,  pectinase  and  lysozyme
successfully damage the cell wall of the cells. Moreover, using a com-
bination of enzymes also results in higher lipid extraction yield [42].
Zhang et al. [247] demonstrated enzymatic hydrolysis with a mixture of
cellulose,  xylanase  and  pectinase  on  Scendesmus  sp.  and  recovered
86.4% of lipid. He et al. [248] used a mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose,

3.3.3.3. Engineered  nanoparticles. Nanoparticles (NPs) are less hazard-
ous,  more  stable  and  more  reusable  than  conventional  solvents  in
extraction  steps.  High  lipid  extraction  of  74.29%  was  obtained  in
Chlorococcum sp. by using titanium (Ti) nanoparticles at a dosage of 15
mg  L-1  [42].  Besides,  zirconium  dioxide  (ZrO2)  nanoparticles  are  re-
ported to improve lipid release in Chlorococcum sp. by two times in the
presence of chloroform:methanol solvent [42]. Huang and Kim [249]
reported a yield of 98.75% lipid from Chlorella vulgaris with NiO-NPs
followed  by  Folch’s  method.  Khanra  et  al.  [250]  used  ZrO2  NPs  fol-
lowed by Bligh and Dyer technique to extract lipids in Chlorococcum sp.,
and the yield was found to be 78.52%. It can be observed that the use of
engineered  nanomaterial  enhances  the  capabilities  of  microalgae  to

biosynthesize more lipids, whereas several studies have also reported its
ability to promote effective cell harvesting of microalgae [251]. Such
nanoparticle-engineering also aids micro-environmental stress induce-
ment, micronutrient supplementation, backscattering of light, magnetic
separation  and  nanoparticle-based  flocculation  which  would  greatly
influence the economic viability of microalgal biorefinery industry [251,
252].

3.3.3.4. Bio-based  solvents. Wan  Mahmood  et  al.  [253]  conducted  a
study  in  which they  compared the  effectiveness of  bio-based solvents
and conventional solvents in extracting lipids from microalgal biomass.
Four  bio-based  solvents  were  compared  with  a  conventional  solvent
(hexane) for lipid extraction from Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis
sp. The four bio-based solvents tested were ethyl acetate (EtOAc), ethyl
and
lactate

cyclopentyl  methyl

(CPME),

(EtLac),

ether

2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF). In case of microalgal crude lipid
yields, all the bio-based solvents exhibited better results compared to
hexane  for  both  strains  of  microalgae.  In  case  of  extraction  of  trans-
esterifiable lipids, bio-based solvents showed similar yields as hexane for
Chlorella vulgaris, but higher yields than hexane for Nannochloropsis sp.
Moreover, all the bio-based solvents performed better than hexane in the
yields of FAME. EtLac provided the highest FAME yield of 33.02% for
Chlorella  vulgaris  while  2-MeTHF  provided  the  highest  FAME  yield  of
41.29% for Nannochloropsis sp. Huang et al. [254] used biodiesel in the
form of FAME as one of the extractants in the lipid extraction from wet
microalgae with 70% water content. They reported the highest extrac-
tion efficiency of 68.19% with a mixture of biodiesel and methanol in a
ratio of 6:4. The yield was 108% higher than the system using a mixture
of chloroform and methanol.

3.3.3.5. Ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are organic salts that exist in a liquid
state at a wide range of temperatures, typically from 0 to 140
C. They
can  disrupt  the  cell  structure  of  wet  microalgal  biomass,  which  then
improves  the  access  of  co-solvents  towards  lipids  or  promotes  auto-
partitioning of the lipids [255]. This method is suitable for wet biomass
as it can eliminate the drying and dewatering steps, therefore reducing
the usage of energy by 59% and further reducing additional operating
costs [42]. The advantages of using ionic liquids for lipid extraction from
microalgae  include  characteristics  such  as  non-flammability,  recycla-
bility, non-volatility and thermal stability [256]. Choi et al. [257] ob-
tained a yield of 250 mg lipid/g cell by treatment with ([Emim]DEP).
They  also  used  a  mixture  of  two  ionic  liquids  for  lipids  extraction.
Among  the  mixtures,  the  combination  of  [Emim]OAc/[Emim]
(CF3SO2)2N had the highest yield which was 255.6 mg lipid/g cell. Pan
et  al.  [258]  used  [BMIM][HSO4]  as  an  ionic  solvent  on  microwave
pre-treated  Chlorella  sorokiniana,  Nannochloropsis  salina  and  Galdieria
sulphuraria, and lipid extraction yield was found to be 0.23 g, 0.10 g and
0.19 g per g of dry algae, respectively.

3.3.3.6. Switchable solvents. There are two types of switchable solvents
(i.e.,  smart  solvents)  namely  switchable  polarity  solvents  (SPSs)  and
switchable hydrophilicity solvents (SHSs) [259]. SPSs switch their po-
larities  depending  on  the  concentration  of  carbon  dioxide,  where  po-
larity  is  increased  with  the  concentration  of  carbon  dioxide  [260].
Non-polar or low-polarity lipids are extracted by the low-polarity form
of  SPSs.  SHSs  change  their  properties  between  hydrophobic  and  hy-
drophilic.  The  two  states  could  also  be  altered  by  the  addition  or
removal  of  carbon  dioxide.  Detailed  mechanistic  understanding  of
switchable  ability  of  switchable  solvents  from  low  to  high  polarity  is
reported in several studies [261,262]. Lipids were dissolved in hydro-
phobic  form,  then  carbonated  water  was  added  to  change  SHSs  into
hydrophilic form. This forms a two-layer mixture that consists of a lipid
phase  and  an  aqueous  SHSs-containing  phase.  Lastly,  the  lipids  were
removed and SHSs were separated from the aqueous phase and reused
[68,75]. A study conducted by Du et al. [261] used N-ethyl butylamine
(EBA) as a switchable solvent on Neochloris oleoabundans and obtained
crude lipid yield of 13 wt% after 18 h. While, Al-Ameri and Al-Zuhair
[263] obtained a biodiesel yield of 47.5% when Chlorella sp. was treated
with N, N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA). Another study by Cheng
′
et al. [264] compared the extraction efficiency of N,N,N
-tetraethyl-1,
3-propanediamine  (TEPDA)  and  chloroform-methanol  on  Nanno-
chloropsis oceanica. The results showed a 5% higher extraction yield by
TEPDA  than  chloroform-methanol.  Based  on  these  findings,  it  can  be
perceived that these switchable solvents exhibit promising results for the
extraction of lipids and the reactants such as CO2  are considered envi-
ronmentally friendly. However, there are limited studies reporting their
feasibility on a larger scale. Thus, it is worth exploring switchable sol-
vents in future studies.

3.3.3.7. Deep  eutectic  solvents. Deep  eutectic  solvents  (DESs)  are  an
emerging  class  of  green  solvents  (i.e.,  transformation  of  ionic  liquid
solvents) that are formed from a eutectic mixture of Lewis or Brønsted
acids and bases which can contain a variety of anionic and/or cationic
species [265,266]. The mechanism of DES solvents is derived via their
hydrogen  bonding  extraction  abilities  from  the  high  polarity  charac-
teristics  of  water.  In  most  cases,  the  organic  salts  (e.g.  chloride  and
choline  chloride)  act  as  the  hydrogen  bond  acceptor  and  the  organic
solvent (e.g. amides, amines, alcohols, and carboxylic acids) acts as a
hydrogen  bond  donor  [267].  Since  the  cell  wall  of  microalgae  is
composed  of  α-cellulose  and  hemicellulose,  the  combination  of
hydrogen bond acceptor/donor in DESs creates an H-bonding interac-
tion that disrupts the cellulose structure composed of hydroxyl (-OH)
group  [268].  Aqueous  deep  eutectic  solvents  (ADES)  are  found  to
enhance lipid extraction from microalgae [269]. Several methods such
as  centrifugation  and  washing  with  water  are  used  to  separate  the

biomass from ADES. In a study using Chlorella, three different DES were
used, and all three ADES-tested strains showed lipid recovery yield of
80.90%,  66.92%  and  75.36%  which  was  up  to  50%  higher  than  un-
treated biomass [268]. In another study, Chlorella sp. and Chlorococcum
sp. were treated with choline chloride-acetic acid, which yielded 21%
and 15% of FAME content, respectively [270]. Table 7 comprehensively
evaluates various recent advanced chemical methods in microalgal lipid
extraction.

3.3.4. Conventional chemical methods for lipid extraction

Conventional chemical methods use chemicals (solvents) to extract
the  lipid  from  microalgae.  The  conventional  solvents  used  in  lipid
extraction include n-hexane, chloroform, methanol, ethanol, petroleum
ether, dichloromethane and any mixture of these solvents based on the
method and desired lipids [274]. Methanol and chloroform are examples
of polar solvents and hexane is a non-polar solvent [42]. The polar and
non-polar  solvents  are  often  combined  to  improve  the  efficiency  of
extraction. This is because lipid yields depend on the type of solvents
and the ratios of non-polar solvents to polar solvents. The theory behind
this states that the polar solvent can break the bonds between the polar
lipid-non-polar lipid complexes and the non-polar solvent will solubilize
the non-polar lipids which are desired for the production of biodiesel
[218]. The drawback of polar solvent is that it extracts chlorophyll along
with lipids [42].

Hexane,  benzene  and  ether  are  often  used  as  solvents  after  the
expeller  press [275]. The remaining  pulp from the expeller  is treated
with  cyclohexane to further  extract the  remaining oil in  the  pulp. By
using the distillation process, the oil and cyclohexane are easily sepa-
rated. This method can yield more than 95% of the total oil produced by
the algae [118]. The solvents break intermolecular forces such as van
der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding and covalent bonding between the
lipids and other organelles [276]. The solvent molecules form linkages
with lipids depending on polarity, non-polar solvent to non-polar lipids
and  vice  versa.  The  solvent–lipids  complex  diffuses  across  the  cell
membrane and static organic solvent film, into the bulk solvent, which is
the driving force moving algal lipids through the concentration gradient.
The process continues until an equilibrium state is reached [218].

Bligh and Dyer method and the Folch method are two of the common
methods for lipid extraction [277]. The Folch method uses a mixture of
chloroform and methanol with a ratio of 2:1 by volume. The biomass is
first mixed and diluted with saline solution, then the resulting mixture
develops two separate layers. The lipid in the upper phase is extracted.
Bligh and Dyer’s method is similar to the Folch method, but it needs the
addition  of  water  as  a  co-solvent  to  improve  the  separation  [221].
Chloroform and methanol are hazardous, so research is underway to find
alternatives  [278,279].  The  selection  of  solvents  has  to  be  carefully
made based on different parameters such as toxicity, efficiency, selec-
tivity  towards  the  desired  lipids,  ability  to  recycle,  and  ability  of  the
solvent  to  protect  lipids  from  degradation.  Table  8  compiles  the  con-
ventional chemical methods used for microalgal lipid extraction.

3.4. Algae-based biodiesel: Hope for future energy

Microalgae  are  a  well-known  renewable  resource  that  contains
multiple useful constituents such as lipids, proteins and carbohydrates
which can be used to produce many value-added products [21]. Besides,
it  is  considered  a  promising  substitution  for  fossil  fuels  in  producing
biofuel for energy generation [23]. Genetic modification of microalgae
is now being widely investigated to improve its resistance to pathogens
or chemical controls such as herbicides and insecticides. There are some
regulations  governing  genetically  modified  (GM)  algae  depending  on
the  procedures  and  applications.  In  the  USA,  the  Federal  Insecticide,
Fungicide,  and  Rodenticide  Act  (FIFRA)  applies  to  the  algae-based
pesticides  [283].  The  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  regulates
the algae which are made for food, medicines or nutrition supplements.
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act applies depending on the

product application. Additionally, in Malaysia, the Biosafety Act 2007
aims to regulate the release, importation, exportation and contained use
of  living  modified  organisms,  and  the  release  of  products  of  such  or-
ganisms, for protecting human, plant and animal health, the environ-
ment  and  biological  diversity  [284].  Research  on  the  use  of  genetic
modification  of  algae  is  increasing  to  obtain  better  lipid  productivity

[27,284].  The  upscaling  from  lab  scale  to  commercial  plant  imposes
societal, cultural and economic risks with the release of GM algae into
the environment. Some potential threats include changes in natural food
web structure, the displacement of native species, local extinctions or
formation of algal blooms. Furthermore, with higher triacylglycerides
(TAGs) content, more reduced and shorter chain fatty acids (C10–C12 FA)

are  desirable  for  fuel  production.  The  GM-specific  implication  for
ecological impacts caused by TAG/FA content should be concerned as
well.

3.4.1. Transesterification of extracted lipids from microalgae to biodiesel
application

Transesterification is the process in which fat or oil chemically reacts
with alcohol to produce methyl esters and glycerol in the presence of a
catalyst.  Refining  and  separation  of  microalgal  biomass  are  required
before proceeding to transesterification [285]. The details of different
catalysts used to enhance the production of biodiesel are shown in Fig. 9.
The  refining  includes  drying,  extraction  of  oil,  and  cell  disruption
which constrains the production of biodiesel because of the following:
(i) cell wall strength and thickness of some microalgae species lead to
higher energy requirement for oil extraction and cell disruption; (ii) wet
biomass hinders the extraction of oil because of the water present in it
[286]. Different mechanisms of transesterification are dependent on the
type of catalysts used. Various studies for the production of biodiesel
from algae utilizing different types of catalysts under optimized condi-
tions are presented in Table 9.

3.4.2. Viability of algae-based biodiesel and their energy efficiency ratio

The viability of biodiesel obtained from different feedstocks has been
examined  for  its  specific  properties  with  the  standards  given  by  the
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) [293]. Some of the
significant properties of microalgal biodiesel as compared to biodiesel
obtained from other feedstocks are shown in Table 10 [294–296]. The
biodiesel  productivity  of  different  terrestrial  plants  as  compared  to
microalgal biodiesel is shown in Fig. 10. It is clearly seen that there is a
considerable  difference  in  the  oil  yield  and  biodiesel  productivity  of
different  feedstocks  and  microalgae.  The  yield  and  productivity  of
microalgae also depend on the content of lipids in the biomass.

The current algae-based biodiesel production technologies are still
being developed  to be considered  for sustainable energy. Energy effi-
ciency  factor,  defined  as  the  ratio  of  energy  produced  to  the  energy
consumed, is used as an indication of a product’s energy sustainability
[297]. Energy efficiency factor greater than one implies the production
of net positive energy, and vice versa [298]. In the production of bio-
diesel from jatropha and palm oil, the energy efficiency factor values are
more than one, compared to the microalgae, as shown in Fig. 11 [299].
Understandably,  the  overall  upstream  processing  cost  that  involves
indirectly
cultivation,  stressing  conditions  and  harvesting  may
contribute to the mass production of algal biomass.

3.4.3. Techno-economic analysis and leading countries using biofuels

The cost of per kg of algal biomass ranges from 16 USD to 33 USD
from open raceway pond (ORP) and closed photobioreactor (PBR) sys-
tems. One study estimates that for every kg of algal biomass production
in 1 acre of area, it costs about 11 USD, but it can be reduced to 4.4 USD
for 100-acre production by using advanced technologies and optimized
conditions  [300].  Although  cost  can  be  minimized,  it  is  still  high  as
compared to biodiesel obtained from other terrestrial plants and con-
ventional biodiesel from petroleum. In one study, Tetraselmis suecica was
cultivated in 1 Ha and 100 Ha and the cost of per kg of biomass obtained
was 15.8 USD and 5.5 USD, respectively [301]. However, the cost was
still high as compared to diesel obtained from petroleum. The cost of
algal biodiesel obtained from closed PBR is about 60–70% more than the
open  ponds.  The  selling  price  of  biodiesel  produced  from  soybean,
cooking oil, and Jatropha are 1.38 USD/L, 0.73 USD/L, and 1.4 USD/L,
respectively, which is higher than the diesel obtained from petroleum,
but  still less  than  the  algal  biodiesel  [4].  The cost  of  producing algal
biodiesel can be reduced by curtailing the capital cost and increasing
productivity [302].

Based  on  the  economic  point-of-view  of  biodiesel  production,  the
recovery and conversion process of algae-based oil to biodiesel is not
affected by its cultivation process whether in an open pond or closed
photobioreactor.  However,  the  major  economic  hurdle  in  producing
microalgal biomass is the cost of synthetic culture media. In the case
study,  the  estimated  cost  for  producing  a  kilogram  of  microalgae
biomass  in  a  closed  photobioreactor  and  open  pond  (raceway)  was
estimated to be USD 2.95 and 3.80, respectively (assumption for zero-
cost  availability  for  carbon  dioxide  supply)  [303].  Table  11  provides
an estimated cost of biodiesel produced by different sources.

Many countries have started to use biofuels to power their futures,
and their native plants have been chosen as significant feedstocks. The
USA, Brazil, and Indonesia are the top three countries out of the seven
countries listed in Fig. 12. Solazyme, Blue Marble Production, Algenol,
Solix Biofuel, Reliance Life Science, Culture Biosystem Organization, Oil
Inc., and Proviron industries are some of the established firms working
to produce bulk biodiesel from microalgae. Algenol, a huge company
based  in  Florida  with  a  stock  market  valuation  of  USD  3.1  million,
produces 8000 gallons of biodiesel per acre of algal harvest each year.
Reliance Biodiesel, based in India, delivers 100 barrels of biodiesel each
day. Biofuels are being developed in developing nations, for example,
India, and Williamson Magor Bio Fuel Limited (North East India) and
Oils of the United Kingdom have formed a joint venture [36].

3.5. Global projects for the production of biodiesel from microalgae

Israel is working on a project under i-CORE, an acronym for the Is-
raeli Center of Research Excellence. This includes four pilot-scale pro-
jects  for  obtaining  renewable  energy  using  cutting-edge  technologies.
One of these four pilot studies is going to fund about 17 million USD for
renewable energy sources. As the industry still implements conventional
methods using corn as a feedstock and converting its sugar to ethanol,
most of the research is focused on finding out the possibilities and viable
alternatives by introducing biowaste from wood chips and even algae to
obtain biofuels. Researchers at the Technion-Israel Institute of Research

are working on examining the photocatalysis of CO2 and H2O into fuels;
biomass gasification; and producing liquid biofuels from biomass, while
researchers at Ben Gurion University are focused on cutting-edge tech-
nologies  to  obtain  green  alternative  fuels  and  algal  biotechnology.
Weizmann Institute of Science is working for cross-university linkage for
the successful accomplishment of i-CORE [305].

biofuels from them is still in its infancy. It is critical to lower operational
expenses  and  develop  a  positive  energy  balance  in  order  to  make
microalgae a source of biofuels, competitive with fossil fuels (fossil en-
ergy input is higher than energy output). Many collaborative research
projects in Europe are investigating/have investigated the potential of
microalgae  for  biofuel  production.  For  example,  4-year  FUEL4ME
project aimed to create a sustainable chain for continuous biofuel pro-
duction using microalgae as a production platform, allowing 2nd gen-
eration of biofuels to compete with fossil fuels. The project started on 1st

January 2013 and was completed on 31st December 2016. The overall
budget of the project was € 5,369,514,10 out of which € 4,014,981,50
was contributed by European Union [306]. The main aims of this project
were to:

(i)  convert  the  two-step  algal  biomass  production  process  into  a
continuous one-step process with high lipid content (production
process);

(ii)  develop a continuous downstream process using all components

of the algal biomass (conversion process); and
(iii)  combine the production and conversion processes.

Following  the  setup and  proof  of concept  under controlled  indoor
settings,  the  continuous  process  was  tested  outdoors  in  four  distinct
locales  under  real-world  production  conditions  (NL,  IL,  IT  ES).  A
continuous downstream process was developed along with research on
biomass production. Finally, the entire process (both biomass produc-
tion  and  biofuel  conversion)  was  integrated  and  put  through  an  eco-
nomic and life cycle analysis [306].

3.5.1.2. Genetic

(GIAVAP). The GIAVAP project started on 1st January 2011 and ended
on  31st  December  2013.  The  budget  allocated  for  the  project  was  €
7,184,970,60. Researchers applied genetic engineering approaches to a
variety of economically important algal strains, with a focus on carot-
enoid and PUFA synthesis, as well as the overexpression of commercially
valuable peptides. Existing model algal strains were used to investigate
different cultivation technologies, as well as harvesting and extraction
procedures for lipids, carotenoids, and proteins. In addition, products
were planned to be examined for energy, pharmaceutical, nutritional, or
medical  purposes  to  assess  the  economic  viability  of  manufacturing
techniques and their commercialization [307].

3.5.1.3. Biofuel from algae technologies (BIOFAT). The BIOFAT project
aimed for the microalgal conversion to biofuels comprising all the pro-
cesses  starting  from  growth  optimization,  accumulation  of  oil  and
starch,  continuing  to  downstream  processing  with  the  production  of

biofuels. BIOFAT was implemented in two phases:

(i)  the optimization of the process was carried out at two pilot-scale

facilities (each sized 0.5 ha) located in Portugal and Italy.
(ii)  Economic modeling and scaling up to a demo facility of size 10

ha.

Both  pilot  plants  named  BIOFAT  Pataias  Pilot  Plant  (BPPP)  and
BIOFAT  Camporosso  Pilot  Plant  (BCPP)  were  designed  and  equipped
with  state  of  art  technologies  and  consisted  of  stabilized  systems  for
microalgal cultivation and biomass production, such as tubular photo-
bioreactors,  green  wall  panels,  raceways  and  cascade  raceways.  The
microalgae  species  utilized  were  Nannochloropsis  oceanica  and  Tetra-
selmis suecica [308]. The specific aim of Biofat was to get the maximum
benefit from algae by causing minimum impacts on the environment.
BIOFAT was planned for four years (from 1st May 2011 to 30th April
2015) to get 900 tons/yr of yield [308].

EU FP7 Energy program promoted three projects for the evaluation
of technical viability of Algal Biofuels. This Algal cluster targeted the
production of biofuels from the selection of strain, cultivation, scaling
up, biomass production, extraction of oil, production of biofuels and its
testing  in  various  transportation  modes.  Three  projects  bear  an  esti-
mated  cost  of  42  million  USD,  out  of  which  27  million  USD  was
contributed by the EU [308].

Besides these, All-gas project evaluated the large-scale biofuel pro-
duction via the cultivation of low-cost microalgal strains with municipal
wastewater.  InteSusAl  focused  on  the  innovative  and  cutting-edge
technologies  to  produce  biofuels  by  optimizing  algal  production
through phototrophic and heterotrophic routes.

4. Genetic modification of green microalgae to improve lipid
production and yield

4.1. Overview of genetic engineering in microalgae

Microalgal  species  that  belong  to  the  genera  Phaeodactylum,  Nan-
nochloropsis, Chlorella, and Dunaliella have been widely investigated in
the  last  decade  for  various  applications.  When  these  species  are  sub-
jected  to  nutrient  starvation,  neutral  lipids  are  accumulated  in  them
[309]. These neutral lipids as TAGs are later converted to biofuels by
transesterification. At the same time, microalgal-based lipids are gaining
interest,  especially  in  the  food  industry  because  they  can  become  a
substitute for fish oil and an alternative source for PUFAs such as omega
3  and  omega  6  fatty  acids  providing  dietary  and  health  benefits  to
humans  [310].  Regardless  of  the  benefits  hidden  in  microalgae,
large-scale  production  of  the  commodities/chemicals  derived  from
microalgae is an uphill task due to the upstream and downstream pro-
cessing costs. Continuous progress and advancement in research such as
genetic engineering and synthetic biology can contribute to achieving an
economically  viable  process/system.  Strain  improvement  by  indi-
rect/direct genetic modification is a recommended methodology for the
enhancement of growth and lipid productivity in the microalgal strain of
interest [311].

When the wild microalgae strains are nutrients-starved, they accu-
mulate high lipid content, but the biomass yield is decreased. Therefore,
genetic modification is a potential strategy for producing the strains that
can  accumulate  lipids  without  affecting  biomass  productivity  and
impairing  growth.  In  the  last  decade,  substantial  research  has  been
carried out to develop genetic tools and produce genetically modified
and improved strains. Genetic modification is carried out by employing
direct  genetic  engineering,  adaptive  laboratory  evolution  (ALE),  and
random mutagenesis. Physical mutagens (i.e. x-rays, gamma-rays, and
UV light), ALE, and chemical mutagens [ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)
′
and  N
-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine  (NTG)]  are  being  investigated  to
introduce  random  mutations  in  microalgae  [312].  However,  effective
strategies based on genetic engineering can generate particular deletions

or insertions in the parent (host) genome to achieve the required im-
provements  and  avoid  the  associated  risks.  Advancements  in  the
development of efficient, accurate, and speedy delivery systems, highly
improvised  genome  editing  tools,  and  the  versatile  technology  of
sequencing are considered to be vital to produce genetically modified
and improved microalgal strains [313]. The nuclear transformation of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was the first milestone achieved in the field
of microalgal biotechnology in 1990. Agitation of cells was performed in
the  presence  of  DNA-coated  glass  beads,  allowing  the  formation  of
micro-sized  pores  in  the  cell  membrane  by  the  effect  of  friction  and
facilitating entry of DNA molecules into the cell [314].

Nowadays, many methods are taken into practice in delivering DNA
(exogenous) into various microalgal strains. Some of the significant and
accomplished  techniques  are  Agrobacterium
tumefaciens-mediated
transformation, electroporation, agitation with glass beads, and particle
bombardment [315]. The bottlenecks of these techniques are that they
are (i) applicable to limited species, (ii) lead to cell death because of
harsh treatments, and (iii) require strenuous optimization to be applied
to other species [316]. The omics technology for microalgae has pro-
vided a methodology for identifying regulatory components required to
develop the strategies of genetic engineering. As such, the identification
of selection markers, splicing signals, reporter genes, terminators and
promoters  has contributed to  the expression  of  heterologous genes in
microalgae.  This  led  to  the  increase  in  momentum  in  the  progress  of
molecular  tools  included  in  genome  editing  system  which  are  highly
equipped  such  as  Transcription  Activator-Like  Effector  Nuclease
(TALEN),  RNA  interface  (RNAi),  Clustered  Regularly  Inter-Spaced
Palindromic  Repeats  and  associated  proteins  (CRISPR-Cas),  and  Zinc
Finger  Nulease  (ZFN).  These  genetic  tools  were  used  extensively  in
studies during the last decade [317]. Table 12 summarizes the strategies
and  the  tools  developed  for  the  enhancement  of  lipid  production  in
microalgae  such  as  the  Kennedy  pathway,  transcription  factors,  fatty
acid synthesis (FAS), and PUFA/TAG metabolism.

Green algae are categorized in the phylum of Chlorophyta, and they
are mostly unicellular and commonly found in freshwater. Green algae
differ from red algae and brown algae by the types of chlorophyll they
possess. The types of chlorophyll found in algae influence the colour of
the  algae.  All  of  the  algae  contain  chlorophyll  a,  green  algae  contain
chlorophyll b while red algae and brown algae contain chlorophyll d and
chlorophyll  c,  respectively  [337].  Chlorophyll  b  aids  in  absorbing  a
wider  range  of  light  energy  for  photosynthesis,  but  it  is  not  found  in
every photosynthetic organism [338].

Green algae are favored in biofuel particularly biodiesel production
because of their high population densities and high growth rates [339].
The  number  of  chlorophylls  is  found  to  be  relatively  higher  than  the
number of other accessory pigments in green algae, while other algae
have  several  accessory  pigments  higher  than  the  number  of  chloro-
phylls. This shows that green algae have better photosynthetic efficiency
than  other  types  of  algae.  In  some  green  algae,  more  than  50%  of
biomass dry weight is comprised of lipid. TAGs and DAGs make up most
of the lipids found in green algae, with other components such as ca-
rotenoids  and  oil  constituents  [340].  TAGs  and  DAGs  are  the  neutral
lipids  favored  in  biodiesel  production.  The  genetic  modification  of
microalgae improves the yield and qualities of the products, in this case,
lipids to compensate for the costs. This strategy targets mainly modi-
fying  metabolic  pathways  to  overexpress  or  silence  certain  genes  to
obtain higher biomass and desired product yield.

DNA  encodes  genes,  which  provide  congenital  characteristics  to
produce  other  molecules  such  as  proteins  to  form  a  microalgae  cell.
Genes are encoded in DNA which is transcribed into RNA. RNA is con-
verted  into  proteins  that  form  other  complexes  and  catalysts  for  the
whole organism. The network between genomes is studied to modify the
gene toward the accumulation of desired products [341,342]. The ge-
netic modification process starts with picking and collecting a gene with
an interesting trait from the DNA of the donor organism that naturally
possesses the specific gene. Next, plasmid DNA which serves as a vector

is isolated from another organism, mostly bacteria. The plasmid DNA
and donor DNA are then mixed with the enzyme that cuts the DNA into
pieces. The pieces of DNA combines according to chemistry and form a
new complete plasmid. This plasmid DNA now contains the gene from
the donor organism. After that, the new plasmids with the new gene are
either inserted or accepted by the bacterial cells by transformation. The
bacteria with the new gene are later grown in large amounts and desired
results can be observed [343]. In this case, green algae have the same
role as bacteria.

4.1.1. Gene modification tools

In genetic modification, genome editing is a crucial part that involves
knockout, knockdown, mutations, insertion and deletion of genes [344].
Gene knockout aims to delete a gene permanently, while gene knock-
down  aims  to  down-regulate  the  activities  of  the  gene  [343].  RNA
interference (RNAi) is a common gene knockdown method [344,345]. In

this method, microRNA (miRNA) or short interfering RNA (siRNA) are
cleaved by the enzyme DICER from pre-microRNA (pre-miRNA) or small
hairpin RNA (shRNA), respectively. Then, miRNA or siRNA binds to a
molecule containing an enzyme called RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC). Next, the complex consists of RISC and miRNA or siRNA bind to
complementary  or  targeted  messenger  RNA  (mRNA)  sequences.  This
causes  cleavage  and  then  malfunction  of  the  targeted  mRNA,  which
further inhibits the formation of a certain protein [346]. According to
Wei  et  al.  [345],  RNAi  is  established  for  only  a  few  species  such  as
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Dunaliella salina and Penium margaritaceum.
The method was tested on Nannochloropsis oceanica strain and achieved
up to 79% transcript level suppression in the strain. Some of the draw-
backs of this method include silencing the desired phenotypes, incom-
plete  repression  of  transformants  and  target  genes,  and  off-target
changes [344]. Fig. 13 illustrates the mechanisms of RNAi as a genomic
editing tool.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10107124

K.S. Khoo et al.

CRISPR and TALEN are examples of gene knockout methods [348,
349].  Transcription  Activator-Like  Effector  Nuclease  (TALENs)  is  a
man-made enzyme that cut the targeted part of DNA and results in a
double-stranded break (DSB) at that part. Then the cleavage can either
combine or a new gene with the desired trait is added to the part, thus
the genomic functions of the DNA are mutated [39]. Kurita et al. [350]
applied the Platinum TALENs in Nannochloropsis oceanica and obtained
the  result  of  efficient  mutations  in  two  genes:  nitrate  reductase  and
acyltransferase in the strain. The study revealed over-accumulation of
lipids  by  employing  TALEN-guided  UDP-glucose  pyrophosphorylase
gene disruption. Fig. 14 depicts the mechanism of TALENS as a type of
genomic editing tool.

Clustered Regularly Interspaces Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)
creates DSBs by recombinant nucleases. The nuclease Cas9 protein forms
a complex with a guide RNA (gRNA). The gRNA can identify the target
sequence which needs to be edited and leads the Cas9/gRNA complex to
search  for  it  [352].  Saey  [353]  found  the  target  sequence,  the  Cas9
protein cleaves it and a DSB is formed at the site. DSB is then repaired by
a  mechanism  called  non-homologous  end  joining  (NHEJ)  and  causes
mutations to happen at the cleavage site. Moreover, the complex of Cas9
and gRNA can be delivered as ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNPs) into the
cells  to  reduce  probabilities  of  off-targeting  and  cytotoxicity  [354].
Chang  et  al.  [355]  have  successfully  applied  this  technique  to  green
marine  microalgae,  Tetraselmis  sp.,  in  which  they  modified  the
ADP-glucose  pyrophosphorylase  (AGP)  protein  in  the  strain  which
triggered an increase in lipid productivity. The lipid content consider-
ably increased by 2.7 and 3.1-fold (i.e. 21.1 and 24.1% dry cell weight).
The illustration of the mechanism of CRISPR is shown in Fig. 15.

4.1.2. Delivery of modified gene

The basic steps involved in algal genetic modification include host
selection followed by identifying and collecting the gene of interest, then
transformation, and lastly selection and screening. The stages of trans-
formation and selection play crucial roles in the whole process [344].
The  gene  transformation  of  microalgae  is  challenging  as  the  DNA  is
needed to be transferred through the cell, plasma membrane and nuclear
membrane. Pre-treatment is often needed, so that the cells can survive
chemical  and  mechanical  treatments  [357].  Various  techniques  are
therefore studied for effective gene transformation in microalgae.

Traditional  methods  of  gene  delivery  include  agitation  of  cells  in
agitators,  electroporation  and  microparticle  bombardment.  In  the
agitation  method,  the  cells  needed  to  be  treated  with  enzymes  to
degrade the cell wall before being agitated with glass beads coated with
foreign  DNA,  and  non-ionic  surfactants  such  as  polyethylene  glycol
(PEG). Electroporation applies electric pulses to form micropores on the
phospholipid  bilayer  for  molecules  to  pass  through.  Microparticle
bombardment  uses  non-reactive  metals  such  as  gold  or  tungsten  as
microprojectiles that carry DNA and shoot them at the targeted cells at a

speed of around 500 m/s. All of these methods have been proven to be
effective on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [357,358].

On the other hand, cell-penetrating peptides and bacterial conjuga-
tion are two of the emerging gene delivery methods that work on some
strains of microalgae. CPPs are peptides with less than 30 amino acids
and act as media to carry the gene into cells. It has been applied to green
algae such as Chorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Dunaliella
salina, respectively [358]. Bacterial conjugation involves the sharing of
genetic  information  from  bacterial  to  cells  by  transferring  plasmids
through pili [358]. Mu ̃noz and his team [357] succeeded in transferring
plasmids  to  Acutodesmus  obliquus  and  Neochloris  oleoabundans  from
Echerichia coli via conjugation.

4.2. Lipid metabolism

Lipid metabolism refers to the synthesis and degradation of lipids for
energy  generation  or  cell  structure  formation  [359].  The  synthesis  of
lipids  is  known  as  lipid  biosynthesis  and  the  degradation  of  lipids  is
known as lipid catabolism.

4.2.1. Lipid biosynthesis

Most of the genetic modification efforts for lipid metabolism focus on
promoting  lipid  biosynthesis  in  microalgae  [360].  Lipid  synthesis
pathways can be summarised into three main steps: malonyl CoA syn-
thesis,  elongation  of  acyl  chains  and  TAG  formations  [176,344].  The
mechanism  and  the  targeted  enzymes  for  genetic  modifications  are
shown in Fig. 16.

Malonyl-CoA is used for fatty acid synthesis. It is formed from acetyl-
CoA through carboxylation facilitated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)
[177]. Gomma et al. [318] carried out a study, in which they tested the
effect of overexpression of ACC in Scenedesmus quadricauda. The gene
ACC1 was first amplified from brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and then transformed into Scenedesmus quadricauda by electroporation.
Scenedesmus cells (1 × 105) were treated with buffer and distilled water,
and 80 μl of the suspension was mixed with 40 ng of the gene expression
cassette before electroporation. After electroporation, overexpression of
ACC1 in Scenedesmus quadricauda resulted in 1.6 folds increment in TFA
content compared to wild strain.

Another  enzyme  to  be  used  in  genetic  modification  for  lipid  pro-
duction  improvement  is  diacylglycerol  acyltransferase  (DGAT)  as  its
overexpression has been reported to result in improved accumulation of
TAG [344]. DGAT acts as a catalyst in the esterification of fatty acids
into DGAT molecules and shifts DAG to TAG synthesis instead of phos-
pholipids  synthesis  [358].  DGATs  are  often  referred  to  separately  as
DGAT1 and DGAT2. They have different structures, but both are primary
enzymes in TAG synthesis in the de novo pathway [361]. However, La
Russa  et  al.  [362]  reported  that  overexpression  in  DGAT  genes  in
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii did not enhance TAG accumulation or result

in any changes in fatty acid profile. This method has been tested on other
species,  however.  Úbeda-Mínguez,  García-Maroto  and  Alonso  [325]
performed experiments using this strategy on the green alga Tetraselmis
chui.  They  obtained  DGAT1  from  Echium  pitardii  and  DGAT2  from
Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  and  used  them  to  transform  the  genome  of
Tetraselmis chui by electroporation. The results showed that there is up to
a 111% increase in TAG content in a set of strains compared to the wild
type (WT). Another study was conducted by Klaitong et al. [363] where
they  tested  endogenous  DGAT  on  Neochloris  oleoabundans  which  also
showed an increase in TAG production and accumulation. One of the
strains showed a 1.9-fold increment in neutral lipids content compared
to WT and overall TAG content in biomass of Neochloris oleoabundans
was found to be ca. 46.1% after genetic transformations.

Besides DGAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT/LPAT)
is also involved in TAG synthesis by generating an intermediate, phos-
phatidic acid [364]. Phosphatidic acid is then converted to DAG by lipid
phosphate phosphatases [365]. DAG is then converted into TAG [366].
Wang et al. [367] resynthesized the LPAAT gene obtained from Brassica
for
napus  and

overexpression. The TFA contents of the transgenic strain increased by
17.4%. Chungjatupornchai et al. [364] applied endogenous LPAAT1 on
Neochloris oleoabundans, cultivated under both N-depletion and reple-
tion conditions. The transgenic strain showed an increase in TAG con-
tent  and  productivity  under  the  N-depletion  condition,  by  4.8  and
2.2-fold, respectively.

4.2.2. Lipid catabolism

Altering lipid catabolism is a strategy of blocking competing path-
ways. One of the pathways targeted for blocking the beta-oxidation of
fatty  acids.  In  beta-oxidation,  fatty  acids  are  degraded  in  the  mito-
chondria  and  peroxisomes,  and  this  is  promoted  by  enzymes  such  as
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD) and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX). There-
fore, it is suggested that ACD and ACOX could be the target enzymes to
be silenced by microRNA [368]. Degraded fatty acids are used for polar
lipid synthesis, particularly membrane reorganization [360]. Kong et al.
[369] experimented with blocking beta-oxidation by genetically modi-
fying Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with a mutant deficient in the ACD and
ACOX  family.  Along  with  N-depletion,  an  increase  of  20%  in  TAG

content was observed.

4.3. Starch metabolism

Since TAG  is the favored  lipid for  biofuel production, lipid degra-
dation and reconstruction of membrane lipids can be considered as a
strategy to enhance TAG production. Phospholipase is responsible for
destruction  of  membrane  lipids  for  TAG  biosynthesis  or  lipid  droplet
deposition  [370].  Shin  et  al.  [370]  used  CRISPR-Cas9  to  prepare  a
mutant  of  Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii  with  the  phospholipase  gene
removed. During the growth phase, one of the mutant strains had shown
up to a 190.42% increase in TAG content. Under N-depletion conditions,
the mutants also demonstrated an increase in both TAG and DAG con-
tent. One of the mutant strains reached a 68.21% increase in TAG con-
tent and 117.97% in DAG content. The increase in the accumulation of
DAG corresponds to the increment in the TAG content.

Targeting  the  acyl-CoA  independent  pathway  is  another  way  to
accumulate TAG in microalgae by degrading membrane lipids. In this
strategy, phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) is utilized
to degrade membrane lipids for TAG synthesis [371]. PDAT catalyzes
the process of phospholipid contributing an acyl group and turning it
into DAG for TAG synthesis [372]. The mechanism of degrading mem-
brane  lipids  for  the  synthesis  of  TAG  and  the  enzyme  involved  is
depicted in Fig. 17. Phosphatidylcholine is a phospholipid with choline
attached to it and lysophospholipid is the product of hydrolyzation of
the phospholipid [373,374]. Zhu et al. [372] transformed an exogenous
PDAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The
TFAs and TAG content in the mutant strain increased by 22% and 32%,
respectively.

Starch is the major carbon and energy storage compound in micro-
algal cells [376]. Synthesis of starch and lipids involves competition of
carbon skeletons, hence blocking the synthesis of starch is proposed as a
strategy  to  enhance  TAG  production  [377].  de  Jaeger  et  al.  [378]
developed  and  selected  five  mutants  of  Scenedesmus  obliquus  with
decreased  or  completely  null  starch  content  by  UV  mutagenesis  and
these  mutants  were  exposed  to  N  depletion  condition.  All  mutants
demonstrated  an  increase  in  their  TFA  and  neutral  lipid  production
without adversely affecting the growth rates. One of them achieved a
TAG content comprising 49.4% dry weight of the cell after 4 days under
N depletion condition. Another study on starch-deficient Dunaliella ter-
tiolecta  mutants  reported  an  increase  in  dry  weight  TAG  content  by
42-92% after UV mutagenesis [377].

In  starch  synthesis,  an  enzyme  called  ADP-glucose  pyrophosphor-
ylase (AGPase) converts glucose-1 phosphate and ATP to ADP-glucose
and  inorganic  phosphate.  ADP-glucose  is  then  elongated  into  starch
granule  chains  by  starch  synthase  (SS)  and  branching  enzymes  (BE)
[376]. Some studies which involved mutation in the subunit of AGPase,
known as sta6 mutant, observed an increase in lipid accumulation along
with  N-deprivation  in  Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii  [379].  Mi-Ae  et  al.
[380]  inhibited  AGPase  in  the  cytosol  with  a  chemical  CDTA  which
resulted in a 27% increase in FA production along with N-deficiency. Li
et al. [381] applied the strategy of silencing AGPase in Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii and observed the TAG content increased by 10-fold. However,

the study also showed inhibited growth of the mutated strain.

Kato et al. [382] genetically modified Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by
mutating a gene encoding a starch debranching enzyme (DBE) in the
isoamylase  family.  This  aimed  to  promote  carbohydrate  degradation
and  redirect carbon resources  into lipids and carotenoids. The micro-
algae  were  cultivated  under  outdoor  conditions  and  cultivation  was
examined under light and dark conditions by changing cycles which is
commonly  unfavorable  for  lipid  accumulation  [382].  However,  the
mutant successfully achieved a 1.46-fold increase in lipid productivity
under the condition.  The mechanism illustrating the  repartitioning of
carbon flux to lipids in DBE-deficient microalgae is shown in Fig. 18.

4.4. Photosynthetic efficiency

Light is considered as one of the vital factors for microalgal growth
and composition of biomass. The adequate intensity of light favors the
production  of  lipids.  This  is  because  adequate  light  intensity  aids  in
storing surplus photoassimilates, which get converted to chemical en-
ergy  in  the  later  stage.  In  a  study,  Nannochloropsis  sp.  exhibited  the
accumulation of the highest lipid content of 47% of dry weight at a high
(cid:0) 1.  One  the  other  hand,  the
light  intensity  of  700 μmol  photons  m
microalgal species Scenedesmus abundans and Botryococcus sp. produced
a lipid content of 32.77% and 35.9%, respectively at a light intensity of
6000 lux [39]. Although starch was the primary product, the content of
lipids as secondary product increased along with rate of photosynthesis
in microalgae. An increase in biomass yield indicated that more carbon
was available for distribution among starch and lipid. Thus, improving
the  photosynthetic  efficiency  of  microalgae  was  a  good  strategy  to
improve  lipid  production.  However,  limited  studies  are  currently
available on photosynthetic efficiency enhancement for green algae.

(cid:0) 2s

In microalgae, light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) are responsible for
the capture of light energy along with reactions in Photosystem I (PSI)
and Photosystem II (PSII) [383]. They are also known as light-harvesting
chlorophyll  antennae  or  antenna  complex.  They  are  normally  large
which  reduces  light  use  efficiencies.  When  given  a  condition  of  high
light intensity, the light energy releases a number of electrons that ex-
ceeds  the  ability  of  the  electron  transport  system  to  handle.  The

imbalance between the photon absorption rate and photon utilization
rate causes the light energy to dissipate as heat. Therefore, it is suggested
that reducing the size of the antenna complex can improve the photo-
synthetic efficiency [384]. Shin et al. [384] used a chemical mutagen,
ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) to generate random mutations to cause
antenna truncation in Chlorella vulgaris. The biomass productivity had
reached 0.224 g L

(cid:0) 1, which was 44.5% higher than the WT.

(cid:0) 1 day

Carbon dioxide fixation takes place during photosynthesis and the
Calvin  cycle  is  the  initial  stage  of  the  process  [385].  A  rate-limiting
enzyme  for  this  cycle  is  called  sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase
(SBPase) which regenerates the precursor for ribulose 1,5-biphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Rubisco catalyzes the carboxylation
of the CO2 acceptor molecule, which then improves CO2 fixation [385].
Rubisco and its role in carbon dioxide fixation is depicted in Fig. 19.
Fang et al. [386] transformed the SBPase gene obtained from Chlamy-
domonas reinhardtii into Dunaliella bardawil and grew the mutant strains
in  culture  media  with  different  concentrations  of  NaCl.  All  strains
exhibited  ca.  5%  higher  glycerol  production  than  the  WT.  Other
photosynthetic efficiency-related strategies include inserting additional
chlorophyll pigments and widening the photosynthetic active radiation
upto  750  nm.  Achieving  these  strategies  by  genetic  modifications  is
theoretically feasible, but limited studies were conducted on microalgae,
particularly green algae [383,387].

4.5. Other transcription factors

It is not necessary to directly apply genetic modification to the gene,
controlling  the  synthesis  or  degrading  of  lipids.  The  idea  of  utilizing
other transcription factors (TFs) that indirectly affect the synthesis or
degradation of lipids can be considered as well [389]. TF is a gene that
has a DNA-binding protein encoded and is responsible for gene expres-
sion regulation [390]. According to Liu et al. [391], LEC1 is a gene that
controls  seed  development,  and  applying  overexpression  of  this  gene
will  affect  other  genes  such  as  ABI3  and  FUS3  which  further  affects
genes  that  control  fatty  acid  synthesis.  The  researchers  of  this  study
overexpressed AtLEC1 in Chlorella ellipsoidea and cultivated the mutant
strains  under  mixotrophic  and  autotrophic  conditions.  The

overexpression of the gene did not affect the growth of mutant strains.
The content of fatty acids and lipids was increased by a maximum of up
to 32.65% and 29.91%, respectively.

A protein called DNA binding with one finger (Dof) is a potential TF
to  be  genetically  modified  in  microalgae  for  lipid  productivity
improvement.  Dof  recognizes  either  AAAG  or  CCCT  sequences  in  the
promoter region of the binding genes. In the promoter region, a gene,
BCC1  can  be  found  and  it  promotes  the  formation  of  ACCase  [389].
Ib ́a ̃nez-Salazar et al. [392] obtained a Dof type TF from soybean and
applied  it  to  Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii  via  bacteria  conjugation  by
co-cultivation  with  Agrobacterium.  Besides  the  increase  in  total  lipids
content up to 2.3-fold, authors also reported that a subunit of the fatty
acid  synthase  (FAS), ENR1  was  overexpressed. Zhang  et  al.  [333]  re-
ported the transformation of GmDof4 from soybean into Chlorella ellip-
soidea and  observed an increase in lipid content from 46.4 to 52.9%.
They also observed upregulation in the ACCase gene and FAS gene. Jia
et al. [389] overexpressed the Dof TF endogenously in Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii and the transgenic strain had resulted in 23.24% higher in
TFAs content compared to the WT.

On the other hand, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is an
enzyme  which  can  improve  lipid  production  when  knocked  down.
Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is a product of glycolysis and can act as a
substrate for both protein and lipid synthesis. PEPC is the catalyst in one
of the stages of the PEP to protein pathway. Thus, it is suggested that the
knockdown of PEPC can redirect the carbon flow to the lipid synthesis
pathway  [392].  The  suggested  mechanism  is  shown  in  Fig.  20.  Deng
et al. [393] knocked down PEPC1 in Chlamydomonas sp. by RNAi which

resulted in a 20% increment in TAG level in transgenic cells. Kao and Ng
[30]  used  CRISPR-Cas9  technology  to  knockdown  the  PEPC  genes  in
Chlamydomonas sp. and successfully reduced the activity of the genes by
94%. The transgenic cells achieved the highest lipid productivity of 34.9
mg/L d, which was 94.2% higher than the WT. Table 13 summarizes the
genetic  modifications  of  green  algae  based  on  different  aspects  and
corresponding genes or enzymes.

5. Current challenges and future perspectives: How far are we in
utilizing microalgae-based biofuels?

As good as it sounds, the challenges of genetic manipulation persist
due to the limited availability of bioinformatic and genomic databases.
This section will discuss the concerns related to commercialization, net-
zero emission, environmental sustainability, risks and legislation con-
siderations of genetic modification in microalgae.

5.1. Current status of the algae-based industry

Biofuel is important in this era while humans are tackling pollution
and  climate  change  issues  caused  by  the  consumption  of  fossil  fuels
during the past decades. The human population is growing fast and an
increasing population means growing energy demand. According to data
provided by S ̈onnichsen [394] on biofuel production in leading coun-
tries in 2019, the USA and Brazil are leading the other countries, with
biofuel  production  of  1551.1  and  992.2  PJ,  respectively.  European
countries such as Germany, France, Netherlands and Spain have a total

biofuel production of 402.3 PJ. These countries use a mixture of bio-
diesel and petrodiesel in vehicles [127,130,395]. Governments around
the  world  have  started  to  develop  policies  to  include  biofuel  in  the
transport fuel sector and it is estimated that biofuels will comprise 20%
of liquid fuels by 2050. These actions have grown the demand for bio-
fuels and increased the burden on biofuel producers and, as such, issues
including  land  availability  and  cultivation  resources  are  emerging
[127].  Biofuel  from  food  crops  (i.e.  first-generation  biofuels)  is  not
feasible due to the competition with land for the food supply chains of
humans  [396].  Production  of  biofuel  with  microalgae  will  be  able  to
avoid competition with food supplies and provide economic potential to
rural communities at the same time [395]. Other advantages of micro-
algal biofuel include CO2 mitigation and reduction in GHGs emissions.

5.2. Sustainability of microalgae-based production

In  terms  of  sustainability,  microalgal  biofuel  is  a  cleaner  option
compared to fossil fuels as it has lower emissions of GHGs, hydrocarbons
and particulate matter, except for NOx  [395]. Despite the advantages,
microalgal  biofuel  is  neither  economically  nor  commercially  feasible

due to limited production which leads to high production prices when
compared to fossil fuels. Currently, industrial microalgal biomass pro-
duction  is  around  15,000  tons  per  year  globally,  which  is  very  low
compared  to  the  demand  [397].  The  cultivation,  harvesting  and  pro-
cessing stages in microalgal biofuel are costly [398]. Light is one of the
important  parameters  in  microalgae  cultivation  and  enough  light
penetration can increase microalgal biomass accumulation. Cultivation
in closed PBRs can provide better light penetration and distribution to
microalgae during cultivation when compared to open pond cultivation,
but  PBR  cultivation  can  cost  2  to  2.5  times  higher  than  open  ponds
[399].

Furthermore, the energy requirement of microalgal biofuel produc-
tion is reported to be higher than the energy content in the biofuel itself
[400]. The biofuel from microalgae is commonly argued to give lower
power output and torque compared to fossil fuel [395]. Therefore, ge-
netic modification strategies are explored to improve the feasibility of
microalgal biofuel by improving biomass production rates and qualities.
Genetic modification can reduce the production cost of microalgal bio-
fuel  by  15–20%  and  generate  profit  from  other  by-products.  Omics
studies are explored in the context of GM and they can provide virtual

predictions and insight into the experimental genome [344].

However,  only  a  few  strains  such  as  Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii,
Dunaliella salina and Ostreococcus tauri have been investigated in some
studies [401]. The cost of genetic modification itself is high and other
aspects such as stability, toxicity, regulatory affairs and safety are still
under  investigation.  Moreover,  to  protect  intellectual  property,  most
companies prefer to prevent the sharing of technology. This can limit
and even prevent the genetic modification of microalgae for large scale
application  and  can  delay  the  commercial  application  of  microalgal
biofuel in the market [402].

5.3. Feasibility of algae-based biodiesel for environmental sustainability

The  biodiesel  obtained  from  microalgae  should  comply  with  the
regulations provided by European Union Renewable Energy Directives
[403]. The CO2  footprint of several algae farming systems was studied
by Azari et al. [404] and the results demonstrated that an open-pond
system,  that  uses  wastewater,  produces  the  least  amount  of  green-
house  gases,  67  g  CO2  equivalent/MJ  of  energy  produced.  This  is
because in an open pond, solar energy is used for lighting and drying.
Heterotrophic  culture  (PBR)  generates  89  g  CO2  equivalent/MJ.  The
need  for  a  continuous  supply  of  CO2  is  negated  during  heterotrophic
farming,  resulting  in  lower  GHG  emissions.  The  ORP  system  using
recycled water emits 95 g CO2 eq./MJ, while the ORP system using fresh
water  emits  149  g  CO2  eq./MJ.  There  are  considerable  differences  in
estimates of CO2 eq/MJ emissions of biofuel produced in life cycle an-
alyses (LCAs) of biodiesel production, with many values exceeding fossil
diesel emissions. The differences in the study are mostly attributable to
the  use  of  several  models,  which  are  accompanied  by  significant  dif-
ferences in microalgae treatment, harvesting methods, and fuel extrac-
tion [300].

The findings of these studies suggest the need for more effective and
efficient cultivation and harvesting technologies in the process of LCA of
algae biodiesel production to reduce GHG emissions. To produce 1 kg of
dry algal biomass, at least 1.83 kg of CO2 is required, assuming the algae
has a carbon content of 50%. The CO2 concentration should be several
times higher than the value given. The potential efficiency of CO2  ab-
sorption varies from 20% to 90% depending on operational conditions,
while the actual efficiency in open ponds is around 35%. CO2 absorption
efficiency is higher in PBRs, at around 75% [405]. The availability of
CO2  supply  (as  well  as  fresh  water)  determines  the  location  of  algae
cultivation sites. If flue gas CO2 is used, the algae farm should be adja-
cent to the power plant or another substantial CO2 source. For optimal
algae cultivation, flue gases with a temperature of 20–35
C and CO2
content of 15–20% by volume can be employed. Flue gases from tradi-
tional power plants must be cooled before usage since their temperature
is close to 95

C, which can harm the algae [406].

5.4. Risks and legislation considerations of genetic modification in
microalgae

Currently, most of the GMs on microalgae are performed on a labo-
ratory scale. When applied on an industrial scale, there are possibilities
for leakage or release of these genetically modified strains into natural
ecosystems, which may cause unwanted impacts on the ecosystem. The
safety of exposing GM strains to the natural ecosystem remains uncer-
tain as they might be unfit to survive, or become invasive, or produce
toxins  that  harm  other  organisms  in  the  system.  Thus,  the  risks  of
genetically  modified  microalgae  are  debatable  and  have  led  to  the
halting of the application of GM on microalgae [401,407]. As genetically
modified organisms (GMOs) are still controversial, algomics need to be
well studied and developed to have a better understanding of the whole
process of GM on microalgae [344].

The  impacts  on  humans,  animals  and  the  environment  of  turning
microalgal biofuel into mass production are also debated. Some micro-
algae  species  such  as  Chaetoceros  and  Prototheca  are  classified  as

pathogens, which means they could produce toxins that are harmful to
animals  and  humans.  Besides,  a  microalgal  biofuel  processing  plant
could  cause  contamination  in  surface  water  and  groundwater,  which
could affect the humans’ water supply chain [401]. Usher et al. [127]
suggested to study the impacts on the environment of a large microalgal
biofuel plant. Water qualities for the cultivation of microalgae vary with
microalgae  strains.  Industrial  and  domestic  wastewater  is  often  sug-
gested as an alternative water source for microalgae cultivation, as these
wastewaters  might  contain  high  content  of  nitrogen  and  phosphorus
compounds, which are essential nutrients for microalgal growth. How-
ever,  excess  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  compounds  can  lead  to  eutro-
phication  which  further causes low oxygen  concentrations due  to the
respiration  of  microalgae  at  night.  Furthermore,  wastewater  might
contain  viruses  and  pathogens.  Viruses  can  result  in  the  death  of  the
whole microalgae population and affect the supply chain due to the loss
of the product. Pathogens can coexist with microalgae and are present in
the harvested product. It is recommended to give post-treatment to the
product to avoid any negative health impact.

On terrestrial impact, Usher et al. [127] stated that an open pond
design  will  increase  the  likeliness  of  contamination.  This  is  because
failure in design or poor construction might release the pond contents
into the ground by leaching. Although the pond contents might not be
toxic, they could lead to the contamination of groundwater. They sug-
gested the use of PBR as a cultivation container to prevent leakage. In
addition,  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  surveys  must  be  done  to
assess the possible threats of large-scale ponds on the local ecosystem.
According to Usher et al. [127], microalgae also produce some gaseous
products  that  cause  atmospheric  pollution  such  as  methane,  organo-
halogens and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Methane is emitted
under  anaerobic  conditions  by  methanogenic  bacteria.  This  can  be
prevented by constant aeration of water. If the methane emission is not
controlled,  it  will  cause  emissions  of  dihalo-  and  trihalomethanes,  as
well  as  other  halogenated  compounds,  which  are  destructive  to  the
ozone layer in the stratosphere. Production of VOCs such as isoprene
from microalgae is observed. VOCs react with sunlight and NOx and lead
to ozone formation in the troposphere. Tropospheric ozone molecules
are air pollutants that can harm the respiratory system in humans and
animals  [408].  Before  microalgal  biofuel  production  begins,  environ-
mental policy should be reviewed to prevent destructive impacts on the
environment. Other than that, certification should be given as a guide to
producers  and  consumers  to  have  a  better  understanding  of  the  pro-
duction [127].

6. Concluding remarks

The  present  review  elucidated  different  approaches  including  ge-
netic modification to enhance the accumulation of lipids in microalgae
for  biofuel  production.  Still,  there  remains  a  critical  question:  Will
microalgae  provide  a  future  alternative  biofuel  and  simultaneously
address the challenges to net zero emission by 2050? The answer de-
pends  on  how  stakeholders  allign  with  the  green  transition  of
microalgae-based biofuels and their economical viability. Based on the
techno-economics analysis, the major cost barrier lies in the cultivation
of microalgae compared to other energy crops even though wastewater
and flue gas are used to cultivate microalgae. Thus, tremendous efforts
are being made in developing algae-based biofuels for sustainable en-
ergy production to replace fossil-based fuels. The ability of microalgae to
harness solar energy to produce lipids has resulted in their classification
as third-generation biofuel feedstock. Lipids are chosen as feedstock for
biofuel rather than starch due to the simplicity in the conversion of lipids
like  TAG  and  DAG  into  biodiesel  via  transesterification.  Despite  ad-
vantages, such as easy cultivation and help in CO2  mitigation, the uti-
lization  of  microalgae  to  produce  biofuel  is  not  yet  feasible  from
commercial and economic perspectives due to limited productivity and
technology.

To  achieve  the  goal  of  making  microalgal  biofuel  feasible  and

accessible worldwide, genetic modification is studied to improve lipid
productivity in microalgae. This strategy involves the upregulating or
downregulating  of  the  metabolisms  that  affect  lipid  synthesis  and
degradation, as well as blocking competitive pathways in lipid synthesis.
However, research based on this strategy needs to be accelerated as only
limited studies are available. At the same time, it is advised that risks
and  considerations,  as  well  as  policies  in  the  development  of  GM  of
microalgae, need to be well studied to prevent further issues. The main
conclusions of this review are summarized below:

• The overall cost of biomass production, harvesting, lipid extraction
and conversion to biofuels has restrained the commercialization of
microalgae-based lipids and biofuels production.

• To overcome this bottleneck, genetic modification of microalgae is
suggested  to  improve  strains  in  terms  of  biomass  and  lipid
productivity.

• In  the  last  decade,  substantial  research  has  been  carried  out  to
develop  genetic  tools  and  produce  genetically  modified  and
improved strains.

• Genetic modification is carried out by employing direct genetic en-
gineering, adaptive laboratory evolution, and random mutagenesis.
• Advancements in the development of efficient, accurate, and speedy
delivery systems, highly improvised genome editing tools, and the
versatile sequencing technology are considered to be vital to produce
genetically modified and improved microalgal strains for enhanced
lipid and biofuel production.
