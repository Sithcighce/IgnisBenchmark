In this review, “cold start” is defined as the startup of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells from sub-
freezing temperatures. Problems occurring during the cold start pose some of the remaining barriers to
commercial applications of PEM fuel cells in transportation, stationary, auxiliary and portable systems. Fun-
damental studies of transport phenomena are critical to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cold
start and offer ultimate solutions to resolving cold-start issues. In this review, experimental studies are dis-
cussed, focusing on output performance degradation, water and ice visualization, and component damages
during a cold start. Analytical, numerical, and microscopic models and their results are also discussed. One
of the emphases is on transport phenomena relevant to cold starts, including supercooling, phase change
and transport of water in the membrane, catalyst layer, microporous layer, and gas diffusion layer. Another
emphasis is placed on the strategies utilized to optimize cold-start processes for improved performance.
The strategies include material designs of the components, cell/stack structures, and startup mode/load
controls. It is shown that all of the effective strategies to mitigating cold-start problems derive from a basic
understanding of the transport mechanisms during a cold start. It is also suggested that future models for
this problem should place a great deal of attention in supercooling phenomena and water phase-change
and transport in multilayer porous media. Lastly, more advanced experimental methods, such as real-time
water/ice visualization and cryogenic microscopy, are needed to validate emerging theories and models.

1. Introduction

1.1. Origin and importance of cold start

PProton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are a promising
energy conversion device that has the potential for applications in
automotive, stationary, portable, auxiliary power systems, and even
submarines and space shuttles [1]. A PEM fuel cell consumes hydro-
gen and oxygen in the anode and cathode electrodes, respectively. It
converts chemical energy directly into electrical energy. PEM fuel
cells have unique advantages over traditional combustion engines.
As a power source, it is clean, since the only exhaust is water. It
works quietly and gently, as there are no moving components inside.
It can have high power density and operate at low temperatures [2].

POne of the most exciting prospects of PEM fuel cells is in automo-
tive applications. In 2017, three major automakers (Toyota, Hyundai,
and Honda) will release their latest fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to the
market [3]. FCVs are expected to survive in a variety of environments
and especially under extreme conditions, such as subfreezing tem-
peratures. The normal operation of PEM fuel cells requires a constant
supply of fuel and oxidants from the flow channel to the catalyst
layer, as well as the drainage of produced water. In subfreezing tem-
peratures, the water produced can freeze in porous layers and even
in flow channels.
Ice then accumulates, blocking gas transport

Ppathways and covering catalyst reaction sites, which eventually
causes start-up failures. It is known that oxygen reduction at sub-
freezing temperatures is as facile as that under ambient temperature
conditions [4]. Therefore, the major factors governing cold-start
problems are those related to the various transport phenomena
inside PEM fuel cells.

PFig. 1 presents the major transport phenomena in PEM fuel cells
during a cold start. Components of a PEM fuel cell include the mem-
brane, catalyst layer (CL), gas diffusion layer (GDL), micro-porous
layer (MPL) and bipolar plate (BP). Hydrogen and air flows pass
through the anode and cathode flow channels, respectively. Diffu-
sion and convection of the gases co-exist in the porous layers (GDL,
MPL, and CL). The CL is comprised of a mixture of catalyst particles,
ionomer, and porous carbon backbone. Electrochemical reactions
occur on the three-phase coexistence sites (ionomer, gas, and cata-
lyst) in the CL. Electricity is generated during operation, along with
water as the reaction product. During a cold start, water transforms
from one phase or state to another. It can be absorbed by the ion-
omer and become membrane water. Part of the membrane water
can transform to frozen membrane water due to the subfreezing
temperature [5]. Water can also evaporate from the ionomer. The
resulting vapor percolates through the porous layers and enters into
the flow channel. Water vapor can also deposit and accumulate in
the porous layers as ice. Lastly, water can stay in a supercooled liquid
state under certain conditions [6]. During a cold start, temperature
rises due to the exothermic electrochemical reaction. A successful
cold start requires that the CL temperature exceeds the ice's melting
point before the reaction sites and diffusion pathways are blocked.
In this case, ice melts and liquid water can be drained through the
flow channel.

1.2. Technical targets

PThe cold start ability of PEM fuel cells is one of the critical targets
in many existing fuel cell technical roadmaps. In 2005, the US
Department of Energy (DOE) set the first cold start target: to achieve
a successful cold start from ¡20 °C and up before 2010 [7]. This tar-
get temperature was further lowered in 2013. The 2017(cid:1)2020 DOE
fuel cell plan calls for an assisted cold start from ¡30 °C and rapid
startup from ¡20 °C within 30 s to reach 50% of rated power [8]. The
latest targets released by the DOE include an unassisted start from
¡30 °C and assisted start from ¡40 °C, both requiring an 8 h soak at
the indicated temperatures [9]. The cold start target in Europe is
¡25 °C for fuel cell development scenarios from 2015 to 2020 [10].

1.3. State-of-the-art

PThe first practical hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell stack was demon-
strated in the 1960s [2]. Decades of research and development have
led to significant progress in the cold start performance of PEM fuel
cells. Such performance can be evaluated by two factors: the lower
limit of startup temperature, and startup time, as shown in Fig. 2.
Startup time is defined as the time to reach 50% of rated power. For
automotive applications, cold start performance has improved sig-
nificantly in recent years. Honda delivered its first FCX fuel cell cars
in 2002. It achieved a cold start from ¡11 °C in 2004 [11]. It was
reported that in 2005, Hyundai's Tucson FCEV was capable of start-
ing up from ¡10 °C [12]. Ballard achieved a cold start temperature of
¡20 °C in 2004 [13]. In 2009, the cold start limit was further
improved to ¡30 °C by the Toyota FCHV-adv, and it endured temper-
atures as low as ¡37 °C during operation [14]. Toyota's Mirai was
reported to have a cold start temperature of ¡30 °C [15].

1.4. Scope and objectives

PThe main purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive
review of the experimental and modeling studies of transport phe-
nomena during the cold start of PEM fuel cells. Suggestions are
made for improvements of theories governing the various cold start
phenomena. Optimization strategies for cold start performance are
also summarized and evaluated. This article is organized as follows:
Sections 2 and 3 present a review of experiments and modeling
studies on cold start issues, respectively; Section 4 presents discus-
sions on transport phenomena; Section 5 summarizes optimization
strategies aiming to improve cold start performances; and Section 6
discusses challenges and research opportunities. Finally, concluding
remarks are given in Section 7.

2. Experiments

PObservations in experimental studies are the foundation for the-
ory development and cold start performance optimization. In one
regard, experiments are capable of revealing new phenomena with
the development of characterization techniques. On the other hand,
the validation of existing theories and models require systematic
experimentation. Validated theories and accurate models can lead to
better predictions and optimizations of cold start performances in a
practical aspect for FCVs. As illustrated in Fig. 3, experimental stud-
ies can be categorized into three aspects. First, tests of output perfor-
mance present correlations among various cold start conditions and
startup performances. Secondly, visualizations of water and ice in
cold starts provide insight into the mechanisms of performance
deterioration. Third, analyses of damage due to component freezing
contribute to a better understanding of cold start effects on fuel cell
durability. Fig. 3 only illustrates representative experimental results.
Detailed literature surveys on experimental studies of cold start are
summarized in Table S1 [6, 16(cid:1)41] in Supplementary Materials. The

Pfollowing subsections discuss the aforementioned three aspects of
cold start experiments.

2.1. Output performance

PIn the first level of experiments, cold start processes are charac-
terized by measuring the output performances; i.e. current density,
voltage, and temperature [16(cid:1)18,25,27,42(cid:1)50]. Cell voltage and
current density are major performance factors, as they determine
power output. Cell temperature is critical to the cold-start process.
Temperature rise is an essential requirement for a successful startup.
A testing workbench for cold-start output typically includes a single
PEM fuel cell or stack, a test station, a gas feeding system, and mea-
suring instruments, such as thermocouples and an environmental
chamber which maintains controlled temperatures [25]. The test
station controls cell current density, voltage and gas feeding condi-
tions. The gas feeding system supplies hydrogen and air as reactants.
It also supplies nitrogen in a purging operation. Thermocouples are
usually embedded in the flow field plates. The measured tempera-
ture may be lower than the actual temperature of the membrane

Pelectrode assembly (MEA). The environment chamber can be made
with insulation materials. It is cooled down with the circulating
coolant. During cold start experiments, fuel cells dissipate heat to
the simulated subfreezing environment. It should be noted that the
actual temperature inside the chamber may vary.

PDuring a constant-voltage cold start process as shown in Fig. 3(a)
and (b), initially, the voltage has some fluctuation. It indicates that
temperature is low and cell resistance is high in the initial state,
which results in unstable voltage control [25,27]. Current density
then either increases or decreases, according to the initial state of
the membrane. When the ionomer is initially dry, the current den-
sity is more likely to increase in the early stage because the dry
membrane is hydrated by produced water, thus increasing conduc-
tivity [21]. The current-decrease situation occurs when initial water
content and current density are both high during the early stage.

PStrong electro-osmotic drag (EOD) effect drives water to move from
the anode to cathode in MEA. Resistance in the anode increases sig-
nificantly due to the lack of water. As a result, the current density
decreases [18]. In the next stage, current density decreases slightly;
because ice content increases, the effects of ice blockage on the reac-
tion sites and reactant supply pathways become more notable and
consequently suppress the effects of ionomer hydration. In the final
stage, cold start failure occurs. Based on the observations of output
performance in experiments, there are several factors that affect var-
ious cold start failures. These include the initial temperature, opera-
tional current density, and the presence of supercooled water.

PTemperature has a varied effect upon the nature of cold start fail-
ure. When the initial temperature is low, such as at ¡10 °C, the fail-
ure process is relatively gentle, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). If the
initial temperature is slightly higher, around ¡7 °C, failure occurs

Psuddenly after a period of steady operation [25]. Fig. 4 shows such a
case in constant voltage mode (at 0.3 V). In the initial stage, current
density increases quickly and then remains steady, indicating that
the electrochemical reaction is not greatly hindered by ice. However,
the cell suddenly stops working at around 1790 s as the current den-
sity drops to zero and the cell temperature ceases to increase. The
fact that a slight change in the initial temperature can result in dif-
ferent failure mechanisms indicates that there is an initial tempera-
ture threshold. For
the
temperature is not increased quickly enough to allow the CL to reach
melting point, and ice is gradually formed in that layer. The ice
grows to cover the reaction sites in the CL, leading to a gradual
decrease of output current density. In the cold start case from ¡7 °C,
the temperature inside the CL exceeds the melting point before ice
fully blocks the CL, even as the flow channel is still at subfreezing
temperatures. Liquid water freezes in it and subsequently blocks the
gas supply. This explanation is supported by the sudden pressure
drop in the cathode flow channel.

PAs for the effects of operational current density, a cold start sce-
nario with higher current density fails much faster than one with
lower current density, as shown in Fig. 5 [43]. The cumulative
amount of water product can be calculated from the integral of cur-
rent density over time. In the two cases shown in Fig. 5, the cumula-
tive water amounts are 0.32 and 0.53 mg/cm2 at the shutdown point
for the high and low current case, respectively. This result indicates

Fig. 5. Evolution of current density and cell voltage in two cold starts with different
operational current densities from ¡30 °C (adapted from [43]).

Pthat the capacity of the CL for ice storage is not fully utlized in the
case of a high current. The mechanism of rapid failure with high cur-
rent density is that ice distribution in the CL is not uniform with a
high current density. Because water generation rate is high in this
situation, there is not enough time for water to redistribute uni-
formly in the CL. Therefore, water tends to concentrate on the GDL-
side of the CL, causing ice to quickly obstruct this region. As a result,
gas can no longer be fed into the CL, resulting in cold-start failure.

PThirdly, the presence of supercooled water could lead to a sudden
failure of the cold start [21]. If supercooled water is absent, the cold
start is more likely to fail gradually. For these two different failure
modes, when supercooled water is present, liquid state water moves
out of the CL and GDL and into the flow channel, thus preventing
blockage of the CL. Once the release of supercooled water is trig-
gered, it rapidly becomes ice. Subsequently, the gas supply pathways
and reaction sites are suddenly blocked by ice and leads to sudden
failure. The supercooling phenomenon is supported by micrography
observations of supercooled water. It is discussed in detail in the
next subsection.

PWhile the discussions above focus on uncovering cold start fail-
ure modes and mechanisms, other experimental studies aim to
figure out the limitations of cold start ability. For single cells, the
minimum successful startup temperature ranges from ¡3 °C to ¡7 °
C, depending on different environment and operation conditions.
For example, in [26], it is found that the single cell can successfully
start up from ¡7 °C with a current density of 0.04 A cm¡2 and
0.08 A cm¡2, although it fails with 0.12 A cm¡2. With an initial tem-
perature of ¡3 °C, no failure as observed over current densities from
0.04 to 0.12 A cm¡2. In [16], it is found that a cold start from ¡5 °C is
possible without causing degradation. Pinton et al. [18] also con-
cluded that a cold start from ¡5 °C could be achieved. Jiao et al. [27]
showed that their single cell could successfully start from ¡5 °C,
though it failed at ¡10 °C. Lowering the unassisted cold start tem-
perature is the objective of cell design, material, and operation opti-
mization. This subject is discussed further in Section 5.

PMost of the cold start experiments were conducted based on sin-
gle cells, necessitating experiments on stacks and systems; cold start
characteristics may be markedly different when single cells are inte-
grated into stacks. Stacks have lower thermal mass than experimen-
tal single cells. Therefore,
temperature variation in stacks is
expected to be larger than that in single cells. Furthermore, optimi-
zations of cold-start performance usually requires consideration at
the system level.

PA cold-start experiment was conducted using a portable 6-cell
stack with a 30 cm2 active area [22]. It was found that a successful
passive cold start could be achieved from ¡10 °C, but it was not pos-
sible to start up from ¡20 °C. Jia et al. [20] experimentally studied
the cold start dynamic performance of a 2-cell stack. The effects of
various conditions were tested, including the ambient temperature,
operation current density, and stoichiometry. It was found that the
2-cell stack could start up without requiring extra energy at ¡5 °C.
The different initial water contents were also compared, indicating
that higher water content may be beneficial to the cold start perfor-
mance. Han et al. [51] used a 5-cell stack to conduct the cold start
experiments to explore the effects of GDL anisotropic bending stiff-
ness. The GDL materials were installed in the stack in two different
directions: one with the higher stiffness direction aligned with the
flow field direction (identified as 0° GDL), and the other placed per-
pendicular to the flow direction (identified as 90° GDL). The experi-
ment found that the I-V performance of the 90° GDL stack was
higher than that of the 0° GDL stack after cold start cycles.

PA PEM fuel cell system was developed for portable applications
[23]. The core of this system was a 6-cell stack with an active surface
of 30 cm2. Aside from basic thermal and water management auxil-
iary equipment, an electric heating device was attached to assist the
cold start. In that study, the cold start processes from ¡20 °C were

Pconducted with external heating of 30 W. It was found that a suc-
cessful cold start can be achieved from ¡20 °C, and long term opera-
tion in ambient ¡20 °C was stable. This study confirmed the
importance of a complete system design for a PEM fuel cell cold
start. Schießwohl et al. [24] set up a PEM fuel cell system to experi-
mentally study the critical factors to improving cold start ability. The
shutdown strategy has strong effects on the cold start time. It is con-
cluded that the minimum successful cold start temperature of a cer-
tain system mainly depends on the thermal mass of the system, and
system thermal mass mainly depends upon the cooling loops. If
coolant does not cycle during the cold start, only 200 s is needed to
reach 50% power in the system. It indicates that deactivating the
cooling pump could be an effective strategy to achieve a rapid cold
start by significantly reducing thermal mass. Strategies for improv-
ing cold start performance at the system level are essential for prac-
tical applications in FCVs.

PAs discussed above, the key to understanding and improving cold
starts is through the voltage failure mechanism due to water freeze.
Although plenty of output performance experiments have been
done in this area, the mechanism of water freezing remains hotly
debated. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further experiments
which focus on observations inside electrodes.

2.2. Visualization of liquid and ice

PAlthough output voltage, current, and temperature measure-
ments provide information about cold start performance, these
alone cannot present the detailed phenomena occurring inside the
cell. Therefore, to better understand the mechanism of performance
deterioration in cold starts, it is necessary to analyze ice formation
[6,28(cid:1)30,32,33,52(cid:1)54]. Diagnostic techniques, such as X-ray imag-
ing, neutron radiography, optical visualization, and magnetic reso-
nance imaging, have been widely used to observe water transport in
PEM fuel cells [55]; however, better visualization of ice formation
still requires technique improvements. Liquid and ice visualization
techniques can be categorized into three levels, based on scope. The
first level is micrography with transparent cells [32,52]. The second
is indirect imaging with neutron radiography [28(cid:1)30,56], or X-ray
tomographic microscopy [57,58]. The third is scanning electron
microscopy with a cryogenic stage and sample preparation unit
(CRYO-SEM) [34,47,59(cid:1)66].

PA transparent single cell consists of all the essential components
of a regular single cell. Specially, a photographing window is con-
structed from the outside to the MEA. Ishikawa et al. [6] used 18 mm
thick Gore-Select membrane and GDLs based on carbon paper that
were PTFE-proofed and therefore hydrophobic. To directly visualize
ice formation on the CL surface, the GDL is made with silver mesh
rather than carbon paper to allow direct observation of the CL sur-
face through the open area of silver mesh. The flow channel is
machined on the stainless steel current collector and is covered by a
transparent polycarbonate plate. These components are all sand-
wiched between the endplates with an open window. This study
showed that given certain conditions, liquid water can stay super-
cooled and can flow out of the CL and GDL. When supercooled drop-
lets grow larger than a certain critical value, they suddenly freeze.
Similar results are found in [21], which showed that ice stays within
the CL at lower temperatures (¡20 °C), while ice is more likely to
present in both the CL and GDL at a higher temperature (¡10 °C).

PA problem with the above visualization technique is that using
silver mesh as GDL does not accurately reflect the realistic condition
of a cell due to increased contact resistance. Fuel cells with silver
mesh GDLs exhibit much lower polarization performance during
startup. Additionally, water access is increased with silver mesh,
enough that the possibility of water flooding is lowered compared to
a carbon GDL. This shortcoming is avoided in the study by Ge and
Wang [32], where carbon GDL is used rather than silver mesh.

POptical access is provided by punching 400 mm holes in the GDL.
Observations from this study supported the view that ice forms
without supercooled water. They found only liquid water at a rela-
tively high temperature of ¡3 °C. In the initial stage (within 90 s),
when the produced amount of water is small, no liquid was found
on the surface of the CL. Liquid droplets then emerged on the CL sur-
face, and their size grew with time. When the start temperature was
lower than ¡3 °C, only ice was to be found on the CL surface at any
time during the process.

PThe contradictory observations in studies [6,32] can be explained
by the fact that supercooled water is very sensitive to peripheral
conditions. The presence of supercooled liquid water depends on
many factors, such as substrate surface hydrophobicity and nuclei
and environmental conditions [67]. Theoretically, if no nucleus were
to exist, the liquid phase would remain until the temperature drops
to the crystal homogeneous nucleation temperature, which is
¡48.3 °C at standard pressure [68]. Conditions are varied in different
experiments or cases with regards to the fuel cell cold start. Even
though macroscopic conditions, such as initial temperature, opera-
tion current density, and component properties, can be the same
among different experiments, it is still impossible to guarantee that
all conditions will remain the same at the microscopic level. For
example, other important factors include fragments in catalyst
layers, size distributions of porous materials, and the hydrophobicity
of material surfaces that are in contact with produced water. These
can act as the trigger for supercooled water. The cold start is a very
complex process in which specific conditions are difficult to control.
Therefore, it stands that the presence of supercooled water is a ran-
dom phenomenon in fuel cell cold starts. As a result, not all the cold
start experiments observed the existence of supercooled water.
Details of the supercooling phenomenon are further discussed in
Section 4.

PAlthough the micrography and transparent cell techniques pro-
vide direct information about ice formation, they do have their dis-
advantages. Because water states cannot be recorded continuously,
the phase transition point cannot be measured. Therefore, other
like neutron imaging [54] and X-ray tomographic
techniques,
microscopy [57,58], are needed to measure the liquid-to-ice transi-
tion. The neutron imaging technique has several advantages. First, it
is non-destructive. Common fuel cell materials are highly transpar-
ent to neutrons, but neutrons are heavily scattered by hydrogen-
containing compounds. Therefore, water in PEM fuel cells can be
easily detected [54,69]. This technique was first used in PEM fuel
cells in 1999 [70]. It is additionally capable of detecting the phase
change from liquid to ice. Thus, neutron imaging is also suitable for
applications in studying cold starts [28(cid:1)30,54,56].

PA dual spectrum neutron radiography technique was developed
to directly measure the existence of supercooled water and the tran-
sition process from supercooled water to ice [54]. Liquid and ice can
be visualized in the in-plane cross section [28,29] or through-plane
cross section [30]. Observation of the in-plane cross-section showed
that there was more ice under the channel region than in the region
under ribs [28]. Oberholzer et al. [29] proved the presence of
supercooled water during cold starts by observing the liquid
water not only in the GDL but also in flow channels at subfreez-
ing temperatures. They also reasoned that voltage failure is
caused by the sudden freeze of supercooled water. Through-
plane detecting found that the peak of ice thickness exists on
the cathode side of the MEA [30]. Researchers found a non-uni-
formity of ice distribution in the CL and reasoned that this may
be due to the non-uniform reaction rate along the through-plane
direction. Thus, water production rate was non-uniform. They
also compared dry and wet initial conditions and different opera-
tion current densities and found that the MEA could hold more
ice before shutdown occurred, with a lower initial water content;
less water produced a lower current density.

PAlthough neutron imaging is convenient for water visualization
and phase transition detection, the resolution is too low to measure
ice distribution inside the CL. To observe more details inside the CL,
CRYO-SEM was used. Four SEM images were taken during the cold
start process at a constant current [61]. It was found that the ice
growth process differs by the magnitude of current density, although
the final ice formations were similar. At a higher current density
(0.04 A/cm2), ice initially formed near the membrane side and prop-
agated towards the GDL side to fully cover the CL with ice. At a lower
current density (0.01 A/cm2), ice grows uniformly during the cold
start, and the final amount of ice is larger than that of the high cur-
rent density.

PIn the same vein, cold start experiments were conducted with
constant voltage [34]. The ice growth processes differed from those
reported by the study mentioned above [61]. At the beginning of the
cold start, ice gradually accumulated in the CL. It was observed that
the porosity of the CL gradually decreases. Ice grows faster on the
side closer to the GDL, while there is less ice on the membrane side.
This ice distribution is contrary to the case with higher current den-
sity in [61]. This experiment was conducted at a constant voltage
(0.12 V) and current density decreased gradually during the cold
start. It follows that the heat generation rate is higher in the initial
stage, and there is more heat generation near the membrane. Thus,
the membrane side has a higher temperature in the prior stage. This
phenomenon possibly suppresses ice formation in the region near
the membrane.

2.3. Freeze damage and degradation

PCold starts might result in the degradation of fuel cells. The main
cause of degradation is damage to the key components, such as the
membrane and catalyst layer, due to water freezing. Alink et al. [35]
studied the degradation aspects of a 6-cell stack with ¡40 °C freeze/
thaw cycles and cold start. Freeze/thaw cycles with dry and wet con-
ditions were compared. The dry state cold start results in little deg-
radation, while the wet state cold start causes severe performance
degradation. By measuring the high-frequency resistance of the
stack, it is concluded that the freeze/thaw cycles result in increased
flooding; after wet cycles, the stack's performance greatly deterio-
rates.

PMembrane degradation is a vital issue for PEM fuel cells [71,72].
The freezing-induced thermal degradation of the membrane com-
monly occurs on the membrane surface, which is the interface to the
catalyst layer. Since most of the water inside the membrane is
trapped in the polymer chains, its freezing point is substantially low-
ered. Hence the subfreezing operation does not notably change this
part of water in the membrane. Water freezing is more likely to
occur on the membrane surface, when the bulk water inside the
membrane flows out [35]. Ice formation on the membrane surface
leads to a variety of problems: expansion of the space between
the membrane and catalyst layer, an increase in electric resistance, a
slowing down of water uptake from the catalyst layer to membrane,
and more seriously, peeling of the catalyst layer and damage of the
membrane surface [16,73]. The mechanical property of membrane
can also be changed because of the cold start [74]. The membrane
may become more fragile under the clamping force.

PAs for the catalyst layer, the heating/cooling rate is one of the key
factors that determines degradation [75]. SEM imaging shows that
catalyst layer cracking is mitigated by an optimized purge process
before cold start cycles. However, there are still plenty of platinum
particles migrating from the CL into the membrane. Phase change
in the CL influences cold start ability and also contributes to CL
degradation [38].

PFor the GDL, ice formation in the pores may result in the change
of its porous structure. It can change the properties of the GDL, such
as the permeability of gas [40] and hydrophobicity [41]. These

Pproperties are essential for the performance of water draining and
transport of reactants. In [41], it is found that the contact angle
of GDL changes from 131° to 112° after 10 cold start cycles from
¡10 °C. In turn, the hydrophobicity also has a strong effect on cold
start performance [76].

2.4. Cold start mechanisms

PThis subsection will systematically explain cold start mecha-
nisms revealed through experimentation. Typically, initial condi-
tions of the cold start entail a dry membrane and the lack of ice.
Because a purge must be done upon shutdown of the fuel cell, resid-
ual water content is low. When the cold start begins, dry gases are
supplied to flow channels. Then, current builds up as electrochemi-
cal reactions occur in the catalyst layer. Water in the membrane
tends to move from anode to cathode due to the EOD effect. As a
result of the oxygen reduction reaction, water is produced in the
cathode. The cathode side consequently accumulates water as a
result of both the EOD effect and water produced from the reaction.
Although the ionomer in the membrane and catalyst layer can
uptake water, there is a limited capacity. The ionomer quickly
reaches saturation, and the excess water turns to ice. In most cir-
cumstances, ice accumulates in the cathode catalyst layer. Some sit-
uations observe the presence of ice in the gas diffusion layer and
flow channel. Either way, the ice can block the pores through which
reactants flow; it may also cover the three-phase points where elec-
trochemical reactions occur. As a result, the cold start fails.

POn the other hand, fuel cell operation may also cause heat gener-
ation. Cell temperature commonly increases during cold starts, as
observed in experiments. The progression of fuel cell temperature is
generally a result of competition between heat generation and heat
dissipation. Heat generation rate depends on the current density;
higher current density results in higher ohmic heat and activational
heat generation rates. The thermal mass of fuel cells also influences
temperature. If the rate of temperature rise is large enough to exceed
the melting point of ice before the ice fully stops the electrochemical
reactions, the cold start may still be successful.

2.5. Summary

PExperimental studies on PEM fuel cell cold starts can be grouped
into three categories: output performance testing, water/ice visuali-
zation, and freezing damage analysis. Output performance testing
analyzes the effects of various design parameters and conditions on
the performance of cold starts. The evolution of voltage and current
density is the result of the combined effects of hydration state (resis-
tance), temperature, and ice blockage. Different failure paths were
found. At a lower initial temperature, the performance drop in the
final stage tends to be slight, whereas at a higher temperature, per-
formance suddenly drops after a period of steady operation. Non-
uniform ice distribution in the catalyst layer and the supercooling
phenomenon can also lead to rapid failure.

PSecond, water/ice visualization experiments seek to uncover the
mechanism of performance deterioration due to ice formation. Based
on existing studies in the literature, the ice formation process during
the cold start can be summarized as follows. The water produced in
the CL is initially absorbed by the ionomer. Ice then starts to emerge
upon water saturation. In high-current conditions, more water is
driven to the membrane's cathode side, so ice emerges first on the
near-membrane side of the CL. With a low current density, the mem-
brane tends to take water from the CL, rather than driving water into
it. In this case, ice emerges first on the near-GDL side of the CL. From
an in-plane view of the section, ice emerges at the under-channel
region early. As the fraction of ice increases, pores in the CL are grad-
ually blocked until the cold start fails. Theoretically, if no nucleus
existed, supercooled water could sustain a liquid state until the

Ptemperature dropped to the crystal homogeneous nucleation tem-
perature (¡48.3 °C) [68]. During the cold start, liquid water in a
supercooled state flows to the GDL and droplets grow. Once droplet
size reaches a critical value, it immediately freezes. As a result, the
voltage falls suddenly after a period of steady operation.

PThird, the effects of cold starts on fuel cell durability can be eluci-
dated by analyzing the freeze damage to components. Ice formation
causes degradation to the membrane interface and catalyst layer
due to the inherent volume expansion of water. An effective purge
process before the cold start could mitigate damage to the catalyst
layer.

3. Overview of models

PModeling the PEM fuel cell cold start process necessitates a com-
bination of the transport phenomena in all components. Analytical
and numerical methods in cold start modeling have their respective
advantages. The analytical model efficiently reveals the key factors

Pinfluencing cold-start performance, while numerical models can
quantify details. Cold start simulation models are summarized in
Table S2 [5,77(cid:1)98] in the Supplementary Materials. In this table,
models are categorized by objects, dimensions, and methods. Each
classification scheme approaches a unique angle, and a comprehen-
sive discussion will follow descriptions of the analytical and numeri-
cal methods.

3.1. Analytical model

PAnalytical models of single-cell cold starts can be found in
[77(cid:1)79]. Fig. 6 summarizes the three major elements of an analytical
model: water balance, energy balance, and performance prediction.
Key assumptions and equations are presented accordingly. The ana-
lytical method for fuel cell modeling is essential for building funda-
mental understanding of the underlying processes by revealing
it provides a general
parametric dependencies [99]. Therefore,
understanding of fuel cell operation and design parameters.

PThe single-cell cold start model is capable of describing the
water, heat, and output performance, which are three major prob-
lems that arise during the cold start process. As shown in Fig. 6,
most analytical models for the single-cell cold start focus on inter-
layer water exchanges. Adversely, the existence of supercooled
water is commonly neglected, along with ice formation in the GDL
and flow channel, since a negligible amount of water can flow out of
the CL without the presence of supercooled liquid. Some theoretical
models focus on supercooling phenomenon [98] and ice formation
in the GDL [100], but since these models are for specific transport
phenomena rather than for a cold start model, they are discussed in
detail in Section 4.

PA water balance model is constructed, as illustrated in the first
schematic diagram in Fig. 6. The water produced has two paths to
move out of the cathode CL; it can diffuse to the membrane through
ionomer, or it evaporates and diffuses to the GDL and flow channel
until it is carried away by the gas flow. The excess water accumu-
lates in the cathode CL as ice. Therefore, the formulae of water bal-
ance are given as follows:

PThe heat loss is mainly caused by enthalpy differences between
the inlet and outlet gases and heat dissipation through various surfa-
ces. Hence, the heat loss equation is written as:

PThirdly, common indicators for performance prediction are volt-
age and current density output of the single cell. Fig. 6 shows that
performance may degrade in different patterns during the cold start
due to differences in hydration conditions, temperatures, and ice
blockages of the membrane. It is important to discern how these
operation parameters affect performance.

PThis model can predict the effects of ice volume fraction on the
cathode overpotential [94]. The overpotential decreases linearly
with ice volume fraction, as voltage loss is primarily due to the acti-
vational loss caused by the blockage of reaction sites at that stage.
When the ice volume fraction approaches unity, air transport pores
in the cathode CL rapidly close, causing the resistance of mass trans-
port to sharply increase and resulting in the sudden drop of overpo-
tential.

PResults of analytical models reveal cell voltage, temperature, and
ice volume fraction performance as functions of time. Typically, in a
failed cold start, voltage first rises due to the hydration of the mem-
brane. During the last several seconds, cell voltage suddenly drops
when the ice volume fraction is close to unity. Ice is formed after the
ionomer of the cathode CL is saturated with non-frozen membrane
water. The temperature of the fuel cell begins to rise after a cold
start. Analytical results can also clearly show the relationship among
parameters, providing a way to identify parameters that affect cold-
start performance. For example, a key study found that the water

Premoval/accumulation ratio (b) is the most critical parameter for
cold-start performance; if the value of b is less than unity, it is indic-
ative of water accumulation in the cathode CL [77]. Otherwise, water
is drained. b is influenced by operation conditions, such as tempera-
ture, stoichiometric ratio, and pressure. The gas flow's ability to
remove water via evaporation is weak, and it requires a relatively
high temperature and high flow rate to make b reach unity.

3.2. Numerical model

PFig. 7 shows a general description of numerical models for the
PEM fuel cell cold start. Conservation equations for gas mixtures in
the anode and cathode are solved and include conservation of mass,
momentum, and gas-phase species, with the assumption that the
gas is an ideal gas and the flow is laminar. Several assumptions may

Pbe made about water conservation. The first one assumes instanta-
neous desublimation of water from supersaturated vapor. The sec-
ond assumes membrane water changes to ice or vapor depending on
gas humidity. The third assumes that the supercooled water is an
intermediate between membrane water and ice. The first two
assumptions are commonly used in existing cold-start models.
Supercooled water has been observed in recent experimental stud-
ies, but mechanisms remain debated. Details of the supercooling
phenomenon are discussed in Section 4. Charge conservation is con-
sidered for all fuel cell components. It is assumed that frozen water
in the membrane does not contribute to ion transport. Energy con-
servation deals with heat conduction and convection in different
components. It is assumed that phases are at local thermodynamic
equilibrium.

PNumerical procedures for cold-start models generally follow a
few typical approaches for PEM fuel cell modeling, as summarized in
[101]. They are commonly implemented in commercial computa-
tional fluid dynamics (CFD) software with customized development,
such as the user-defined function (UDF) for FLUENT [5,80,85,88], or
COMSOL [82]. The discretization scheme is usually based on the
finite volume method (FVM), as well as the finite element method
(FEM) [82]. After discretization, a Gauss-Seidel iterative solver can
be used to solve the complex linear systems. Since cold-start models
are usually constructed in a transient state, the PISO algorithm is
commonly used to solve the Navier(cid:1)Stokes equations, as well as the
SIMPLE algorithm [84]. A special issue for cold-start modeling is the
treatment of phase change in various areas, such as the presence of
ice in the CL/GDL and the freezing of membrane water in ionomer.
These equations are usually coded through user-defined interfaces.

P3.2.1. One-dimensional numerical model

POne-dimensional models are commonly used for simulating cold
starts at the stack level. Since temperature affects the cold start in a
PEM fuel cell stack, the core idea of this model is to predict the
stack's cold-start performance based on temperature distribution.
Lower computational costs present a major advantage of these sim-
plified models; additionally, simulations can be done on small stacks
or practical, large-scale stacks with hundreds of cells, while making
minute variations to the model [92,93].

PAn early thermal model [92] adopted the layered modeling
approach. This model could be considered a quasi-one dimensional
model. Each cell in the stack is separated into layers, including the
coolant, plate, anode gases, anode GDL, anode CL, membrane, cath-
ode CL, cathode GDL, cathode gases, and cathode plate. At the two
ends of the stack are the endplates. The entire stack is constructed
by repeating single-cell layers. Temperature distribution can be
obtained from this model, without having to solve for differential
equations. Khandelwal et al. [93] developed a one-dimensional
model that included conduction and convection heat transfer. In this
model, start-up time is defined as the time when temperatures in all
regions exceed 0 °C. Based on this indicator, various conditions are
simulated, such as operation current density, inlet gas temperature,
and external heating. Start-up time and energy consumption with
respect to the number of stack cells are analyzed using this model. It
was found that start-up time and normalized energy decreased
sharply as the number of cells in a small stack increased (fewer than
10 cells). In stacks containing more than 20 cells, the number of cells
no longer had a notable influence on cold-start characteristics.

PA one-dimensional stack model was developed that accounts for
multi-phase transport phenomena, including heat transfer, mem-
brane water transport, liquid water transport, ice formation, and gas
diffusion [94]. This model provides more precise predictions of cold-
start performance and more details about transport phenomenon,
compared to early thermal models. Furthermore, since all governing
equations are solved in the through-plane direction, it also has high
computational efficiency. It therefore is easily applied to large-scale

Pstacks. Some relevant simulation results based on this model are dis-
cussed as follows.

PThe effects of stack size on the start duration and maximum stack
temperatures in failed cold start processes are shown in Fig. 8(a).
Start duration is defined as the time from the beginning of a cold
start to the shutdown moment; all test cases led to failure, as seen in
Fig. 8(b). The start duration also describes the time when the stack
reaches its maximum temperature, since temperature stops increas-
ing upon shutdown. The temperatures shown in this figure illustrate

the through-plane direction; (b): Cold start duration and maximum stack tempera-

Pmaximum temperatures that correspond to stacks with various
amounts of cells. Stacks with more cells appear to sustain the cold-
start process for longer and can reach a higher final temperature. In
terms of stack size, the heat generation rate is proportional to the
volume of the stack, while the heat dissipation rate is proportional
to the surface area of the stack. Larger stacks have smaller specific
surface area and therefore smaller heat losses. As a result, larger
stacks tend to be better insulated. This effect is more significant
when the cell number is under five. It is observed that compared to a
single cell, a 5-cell stack can increase the cold-start duration by 2 s
and obtain a 5 °C higher final temperature. However, in stacks with
more than 20 cells, both the cold-start duration and final tempera-
ture tend to be steady, even as cell number increases. This observa-
tion is consistent with the results in [93]. Temperature distribution
along the through-plane direction, among stacks of different cell
numbers, are shown in Fig. 8(b). Generally, cells in the middle region
have higher temperatures due to heat dissipation occurring at the
endplates. The temperature differences between the peak value in
MEA and valley value in flow channels vary based on conditions and
material properties. Fig. 8(c) shows the evolution of ice volume frac-
tion distributions in the 50-cell stack. The cold-start is at a constant
current of 0.15 A cm¡2. More ice accumulated in the side cells due to
the lower temperature in these regions. The variation in the amount
of ice from the side cells to the middle cells tended to increase over
time due to an increase in the temperature gradient.

P3.2.2. Multi-dimensional multiphase model

PMultiphase cold-start models in two dimensions [80(cid:1)83,102] or
three dimensions [5,84(cid:1)89,103,104] allow for more precision during
simulation. They reveal more details about transport phenomena
than one-dimensional models, especially for anisotropic materials.
The major features of multi-dimensional, multiphase models are
that they are capable of resolving the effects of spatial distribution of
water, ice, temperature, and their couplings on cold-start perfor-
mance. The transient temperature distribution in the through-plane
cross-section of a straight channel single cell is shown in Fig. 9 [5].

Fig. 9. Transient temperature distribution in a through-plane cross section of a
straight-channel PEMFC (adapted from [5]).

PThe highest temperature was located in the MEA under-channel
region, from being directly heated up by ohmic heat produced in the
dry electrolyte and the reaction heat generated in the CLs. The tem-
perature in the anode side was higher than the cathode side because
the former's catalyst layer was dryer than the latter's. In addition,
due to the higher thermal conductivity of hydrogen compared to
oxygen, the heat transfer rate is higher in the anode.

PThe temperature distribution is also affected by the rate of heat
generation from various sources. Typically, the largest source of
heating is ohmic heat, resulting from the low electric conductivity
and the relatively high current density of the membrane during con-
stant voltage operation. If the current density is low, ohmic heating
would be insignificant. In comparison, activational heating can be
higher than ohmic heating [84]. Reversible heat and latent heat are
much lower than activational heat. After the cathode CL is fully
obstructed by ice, all the heating sources disappear as reactions ter-
minate and current density drops to zero. Immediately after that
point, cell temperature reaches its peak point.

PThe evolution of water in the cathode CL, anode CL, and mem-
brane is different due to the combined effects of EOD and back diffu-
sion. Before the cathode CL ionomer is saturated, water content in
the cathode CL sharply increases. In the same stage, membrane
water in the cathode CL is not only supplied by the EOD effect, which
drives water from the anode to cathode, but also by the water reac-
tant generated in the cathode CL. The decrease of water in the anode
CL is a result of competition between the EOD effect and back diffu-
sion effect. After the cathode CL ionomer is saturated, the rate of
water increase slows down in the cathode CL.

PFig. 10 shows the transient ice distribution in the cathode CL in
the through-plane direction. Ice first formed in the middle of the CL.
In the region close to the membrane, ice does not easily form, since
water in this region tends to diffuse into the membrane due to a
large gradient. In the region near the flow channel, water can more
easily be taken by the dry air flow. As a result, the rate of ice forma-
tion is lower in this region. The temperature in the under-land
region is lower than that of the under-channel region because the
former is closer to the surrounding walls. As a result, it was observed
that ice first emerges under the land and then propagates to the
under-land region. Eventually, the cathode CL is fully covered by ice,
indicating the failure of the cold start process.

PAs the stack level, multi-dimensional models are rare in the litera-
ture due to the necessity of heavy calculations. A two-dimensional
PEM fuel cell stack model was developed in [95]. This model considers
the formation and melting of ice, species transport, and current distri-
bution. The implicit finite-difference method was used to solve the sys-
tem of equations. To validate this model, single-cell simulation results
are compared with the experiment's results in [105]. The experiment
was conducted with a single cell, which had a reaction area of 104 cm2
and a membrane of 30 mm Gore-Tex. This model was used to simulate
a large-scale stack consisting of 230 cells of 430 cm2 cross-section
area. It was found that a high current density favors a rapid cold start,
because more heat can be produced. Thin metal plates, which have
lower thermal mass, are also beneficial for a rapid cold start. A three-
dimensional stack cold start model was developed in [90]. Cold-start
characteristics of a 3-cell stack, a 2-cell stack, and a single cell were
compared. The study found that the temperature of the middle cell
was higher than the side cells due to its distance from heat dissipation
surfaces. The temperature of the anode side of the stack was higher
than that of the cathode side because more ohmic heat was pro-
duced on the anode side. For stacks of varying cell numbers,
average cell voltages were similar at the beginning of the cold
start due to similar initial conditions. Voltage discrepancies
between different stacks became more notable as ice gradually
accumulated in cathode CLs. The voltage of
stacks
decreased more slowly due to a lower rate of ice formation and
a higher rate of increasing temperature.

3.3. Microscopic model

3.4. Model validation

PCold-start models for single PEM fuel cells or stacks assume
homogeneous cell component materials. However, microscopic
models are needed to analyze the effects of component microstruc-
tures on freezing and transport processes. To describe the micro-
scopic morphology of the NafionTM membrane, three types of
structural models have been proposed: the cluster-network model
[106], rod-like structure model [107], and cylindrical nanochannel
model [108]. These models differ in their description of the void pat-
terns of the membrane. The distribution of the hydrophobic back-
bone of PTFE and hydrophilic sulfonic acid groups is a major factor
that determines water transport and phase change features in the
membrane at subfreezing temperatures.

PThe real nanostructure of the membrane, and how it affects water
phase changes at subfreezing temperatures, remains debated. The
rod-like structure model [107] assumes that the membrane's nano-
structure transforms when the membrane switches from the dry
state to the hydrated state. Schmit and Chen [108] presented the
parallel nanochannel model. The schematic diagram of the nano-
channel is shown in Fig. 11. Polymer backbones form nanochannels,
which provide pathways for water diffusion. The inner side of the
nanochannel is covered with hydrophilic groups. At subfreezing
temperatures, water in the larger diameter channel freezed, while
membrane water in smaller channels remained free. A model based
on this theory successfully predicted that NafionTM maintains con-
ductivity at a very low temperature, which was later supported by
experiments.

PThree-phase contact interfaces are sites where electrochemical
reactions occur and ice forms. Microscopic modeling of ice in the CL
can be found in [59,61,109]. A three-phase boundary cathode CL
model was developed [59]. Some basic assumptions were made:
first, the reaction only occurs with oxygen dissolved in the ionomer.
Secondly, mass transport losses are negligible. This model explained
the evolution of ice distribution in the CL, as observed in experi-
ments with CRYO-SEM. Two types of physical damage in the MEA
due to the cold start were found [110,111]. Diffusion media perfo-
rated through and delaminated the catalyst. An analytical model
was developed to predict the time of ice melting in the GDL, as a cor-
relation to structural parameters and thermal properties [97].

PAn important part of modeling the PEM fuel cell cold start is
experimental validation. The uncertainties of mathematical models
commonly originate from two aspects [112]. One is epistemic uncer-
tainty due to the lack of understanding of certain properties or
mechanisms. For example, imperfect modeling methods for heat
and mass transfer in porous media can be a source of uncertainty.
The epistemic uncertainties also derive from the less precise meas-
urements of material properties, such as conductivity, porosity, per-
meability, and catalyst reactivity. Environmental variations, as in
temperature, are also sources of epistemic uncertainties. The second
category is aleatory uncertainty, which stems from the statistical
nature of physical phenomena. For the cold start, the stochastic
behavior of supercooled water is a major source of uncertainty.

PIn PEM fuel cell cold start model validation, commonly used vari-
ables include voltage output, cumulative water amount, and evolu-
tion of cell temperature. All multiphase numerical cold-start models
reviewed in this section are validated by quantitative comparisons
between model predictions and experimental results under certain
conditions. Mao et al. [85] used transient voltage and cumulative
product water as parameters to validate the three-dimensional mul-
tiphase model. For transient voltage, the minimum relative error is
around 3% and the maximum relative error is 14%. This accuracy is
based on a constant-current cold start at ¡20 °C and 0.04 A cm¡2. By
comparing the amount of produced water, the model was validated
under a wide range of conditions, with variations in cold-start
temperature (¡20 °C to ¡30 °C), current density (0.04 A cm¡2 to
0.1 A cm¡2), membrane thickness (30 mm to 60 mm) and membrane
water content (dry purge and equilibrium purge). The result showed
that model accuracy was well within § 20% under many conditions.
PBalliet and Newman [102] conducted experiments to validate
the two-dimensional multiphase cold start model. Validation fac-
tors included cumulative water amount, initial cell potential, cell
voltage during the cold start, and the evolution of cell tempera-
ture. For the amount of cumulative water, errors were generally
within § 20%. Cold start temperature ranged from ¡5 °C to ¡30 °
C and active cell area ranged from 5 cm2 to 320 cm2. For initial
cell potential, the maximum error was around 12%. By validating
cell voltage and the evolution of temperature, it was found that
error increased with the decrease of cold start temperature.
When the cold start temperature was between ¡10 °C and ¡20 °
C, the error of voltage and temperature was limited to 10% and
15%, respectively. However, when the cold start temperature was
¡30 °C, the maximum error of voltage could be more than 100%,
and the temperature error could be around 40%, rendering these
modeling results unreliable. These findings suggest that cold
start models have their ability boundaries. Model predictions can
match experimental results very well within certain conditions,
but errors can be of a great magnitude if models are used
beyond their range of applicability.

PKo and Ju [88] validated the multiphase cold start model under
various conditions. Current density ranged from 0.04 A cm¡2 and
0.08 A cm¡2, cold start temperature varied from ¡20 °C to ¡30 °C,
and water content varied from 2.9 to 6.4. Cell voltage was used for
the validation. The study found that the model predictions agreed
with experimental results within the above-mentioned conditions.
The errors were between 3% and 16%, depending on the stage of volt-
age evolution. Much like the results from [85], it was found that
maximum model errors occur when voltage starts to drop due to ice
blockage; the model predicted faster voltage drops than the experi-
ment. Nevertheless, the model predicated characteristics of voltage
evolution for a failed cold start process and also captured the effects
of key conditions, such as initial membrane water content and initial
temperature. A similar phenomenon was found for the validation of
a one-dimensional stack model (voltage error: 3% to 8%) [94] and for
a three-dimensional multiphase single-cell cold start model (voltage
error: 3%(cid:1)5%) [5]. All of these models compared favorably to experi-
ments, except that voltage decay could not be precisely predicted.
This issue is mainly due to the difficulty in understanding the actual
impact of ice formation on the reactivity of catalyst layers. To
improve the cold-start model regarding the voltage decay profile
issue, Mishler et al. [30] used high-resolution neutron radiography
to observe the ice formation process, with the goal of modifying the
numerical model. They found that the ice coverage factor is not a
constant, but is dependent on ice content. After this modification,
the model could be well-validated by experimental results, and the
voltage decay process was better precisely modeled, with less than a
6% error.

PExisting analytical models in the literature do not provide
direct validation by comparing model results with experimental

Presults. There are two reasons for this situation. First, for analyti-
cal cold start models, many assumptions and simplifications
must be made, rendering this model incapable of reproducing
the experiment. For example, analytical models commonly
assume that ice only forms in the CL, which is treated with a
lumped model. However, experiments commonly find that ice
accumulates in the GDL and even the flow channel, and that the
thickness of the CL also greatly impacts cold-start performance.
Therefore, it is seemingly futile to validate these analytical mod-
els with direct experiments. The second reason is that the major
goal of analytical cold start models is to clearly show parametric
dependencies and to provide a general understanding of fuel cell
operation and effects of design parameters in order to suggest
parametric optimization strategies. Predicting performance or
phenomena is not the aim of analytical cold start models. Rather,
the reliability of analytical models is based on well-developed
fuel cells and its transport phenomena. Some
knowledge of
microscopic models are focused on modeling component proper-
ties under sub-freezing conditions. For example,
the model
described in [108] is validated by comparing modeling results to
experimental
results from a small-angle X-ray. Some other
microscopic models focus on the ice formation process in porous
media [59,61,97,109]. These theoretical models are difficult to
validate in direct experiments. Although it is challenging to
quantify the accuracy of these theoretical models, they do pro-
vide fundamental insights that benefit further in-depth studies.

PFour conclusions can be reached from the above discussion.
First, multiphase numerical models were all validated by com-
paring model predictions to experimental results, and within
certain conditions, the relative errors were capped at 3 to 20%.
This level of accuracy is acceptable for observing the effects of
various conditions on cold-start performance. Secondly, future
model validation should focus on the critical point at which volt-
age sharply decreases. Third, analytical cold start models do not
commonly provide direct validation through experiments due
the many assumptions made for analytical models, so experi-
mental conditions cannot be reenacted. These analytical models
are useful, as they could reveal parametric dependencies and
suggest directions for optimization. Fourth, these cold start mod-
els have their boundaries; while model predictions can match
experimental results reasonably within certain conditions, the
magnitude of errors can be unreasonable if the models attempt
to simulate conditions outside of their capability.

3.5. Summary

PThis section reviewed modeling studies on PEM fuel cell cold
starts. Models are categorized into three types according to their
methods and scopes: analytical, numerical, and microscopic. Analyt-
ical models can directly build on correlations between various
parameters. Through this, key factors affect the cold start perfor-
mance can be discovered. In an analytical cold start model, the basic
structure consists of water balance submodel, energy balance sub-
model, and performance prediction submodel. Numerical models
can be implemented in different dimensions. One-dimensional
numerical models are suitable for simulating fuel cell stacks, as the
characteristics along the through-plane direction dominate the cold
start. Studies based on one-dimensional stack models found that
larger stacks last longer before a cold start failure. Thermal proper-
ties also influence cold-start performance. Lower heat capacity and
higher conductivity are favored. Multi-dimensional multiphase
models can predict water and ice distribution in different dimen-
sions. Thus, they can provide more details for cold-start performance
optimization. Microscopic models give insight into the mechanism
of water freezing in the membrane and porous layers. The parallel
nanochannel model for NafionTM explains the coexistence of frozen

Pmembrane water and free membrane water under subfreezing con-
ditions. The three-phase boundary model for the CL explains the
evolution of ice distribution in the CL, as observed in experiments
with CRYO-SEM. Model validation has been made for all the multi-
phase numerical models discussed in this review, and the relative
errors are between 3% and 20%, which are acceptable for the pur-
poses of analyzing the cold-start process. Models should be used
carefully by considering the appropriate scope. Further model vali-
dation needs to be made with focus on the critical failure stage,
when voltage drops quickly.

4. Transport phenomena in cold start

PSince the cold-start process involves a wide temperature range,
from subfreezing to normal temperatures, the transport phenomena
differ from those in normal operation, especially when the phase
change of water is involved. In this section, mechanisms of various
transport processes during the cold start in PEM fuel cells are ana-

4.1. Water transport

P4.1.1. Membrane processes

PWater transport in the ionomer is affected by the temperature
and water content during the cold start process. There are two
aspects to be discussed. One is the phase change from free mem-
brane water to frozen membrane water. The other is the diffusion
process of free membrane water. As illustrated in Fig. 1, at normal
¡ bond or
temperatures, membrane water diffuses through the SO3
in its free state according to the saturation states [113]. At a sub-
freezing temperature, some of the free water becomes frozen mem-
brane water, which does not contribute to proton conduction. The
amount of remaining free membrane water is temperature-depen-
dent [56].

PThere are three types of non-frozen water with different mobili-
¡. The
ties, which depend on the bonding strength of water to SO3
type of membrane water with the most mobility is widely consid-
ered to be bulk water. The second strongest is free water, which is
¡. It has a slightly lower freezing point than
loosely bound to SO3
bulk water because it is confined in membrane pores. The third type
of water is more tightly bonded to hydrophilic groups. Hence it can
induce a notable freezing point reduction, although it is still freez-
able. It is possible for all the above water freezes to occur at sub-
freezing temperature. Another type of water is non-freezable water,
¡. This portion of water does not
which is most tightly bound to SO3
freeze as temperature decreases, and therefore is always contribut-
ing to proton transfer. This type of water has a saturation limit of
around 4.8 water content.

PWhen a cold start process initiates, certain regions of the mem-
brane become hydrated due to the EOD effect and water generation.
If the initial water content is very low, the water initially accumu-
lated becomes non-freezable water until it reaches the saturation
limit. When this moment occurs, the produced water becomes non-
frozen membrane water until saturation. The content of saturated
water is governed by temperature.

PThe water diffusion coefficient in membrane depends on the
water content in the membrane. The correlation was determined by
experiments [114,115]. Pulsed gradient nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is usually used to measure the water diffusion
coefficient. There are two correlations commonly used for PEM fuel
cell cold-start modeling. They are listed as Eqs. (24) and (25)
[114,115].

P4.1.2. Porous layers

PWater transport and phase changes in porous layers (CL, MPL,
and GDL) are factors critical to the PEM fuel cell cold start. This sub-
section discusses ionomer water diffusion in the CL and water phase
changes in porous layers. Emphases are made on two subjects: the
supercooling phenomenon and the effects of the MPL on transport.

P4.1.2.1. Ionomer water transport in CL.
PIn the catalyst layer, water
exists in various states, such as ionomer water, liquid water, vapor,
ice, and supercooled liquid water. Ionomer water transport in the CL
is essentially the same as that in the membrane. The difference is
that a part of the CL is composed with carbon backbones and can be
regarded as an interconnected reticular structure. Hence the effec-
tive diffusion coefficient should be corrected by the transfer cross-
section area.

P4.1.2.2. General descriptions of water phase change in CL.
PWater phase
change in the CL is more complex compared to that in the membrane
due to structure porosity and ionomer/carbon mixing composition.
As mentioned in Section 2, supercooled water is not likely to be pres-
ent at very low temperatures. Therefore, a common assumption is
that water in the CL exists in four states without supercooled water
during cold start [5]. This theory suggests that there are two paths
for the non-frozen membrane water to change to ice, as shown in
Fig. 7. In the first path, non-frozen membrane water freezes to ice
directly, under the condition that fully humidified gases are supplied
to the CL. In the second path, when water vapor is not saturated in
gases around the ionomer, non-frozen water first changes to vapor
and then desublimates to ice. Evidently, the second path is more
likely to occur during the cold start because non-humidified gases
are commonly supplied in order to suppress the rate of ice forma-
tion. Many models are developed based on this theory, and the
model predictions reasonably agree with experimental results, as
previously discussed in Section 3.

P4.1.2.3. Origin of the supercooling phenomenon.
PThe ice formation
theory without supercooled water cannot explain some behaviors of
the cold start. An important one is the significant cycle variations. It
was found that when the cold start is repeated many times, opera-
tion times before voltage failure could vary notably from cycle to
cycle [29,116,117]. Oberholzer et al. [29] demonstrated that opera-
tion time variations are stochastic. As shown in Fig. 12, there is no
correlation between the fuel cell operation time and high-frequency
resistance (HFR) prior to the cold start. The operation time is not
independent of maximum voltage, either. In summary, all observa-
tions indicated that the cold start cycle variation is a stochastic

P4.1.2.4. Effects of cold-start factors on the supercooling phenomenon.
After the direct observation of supercooled water, further experi-
ments were conducted to analyze the correlation between the
behavior of supercooled water and various factors during the cold
start. This section summarizes four major factors that influence the
behavior of supercooled water: initial temperature, initial water
content, current density, and pore diameter. First, supercooled water
is more likely to be present at a higher initial temperature [21,57].
Secondly, supercooled water is also more likely to exist at higher
current densities [29,57]. A study showed that without supercooled
water, water instantly froze in the CL and voltage slowly dropped
[57]. When supercooled water was present, it flowed from the CL to
GDL, which suddenly froze, leading to a sudden drop of voltage.
Third, an initial dry condition favors the existence of supercooled
water [6]. This may be due to the residual water that turns to ice
before the cold start; the starting ice effectively acts as seeds, which
promotes nucleation. Thus, the supercooled water is unstable with-
out purging. Fourthly, smaller pore size favors supercooled water. A
study on pore size found that supercooled water could be sustained
inside the CL, which has a smaller pore size, but supercooled water
flowing out of the CL is more likely to freeze at the interface between
the CL and GDL [98]. Similarly, it was found that supercooled water
was more likely to freeze inside the larger gaps between the CL and
MPL, but when the gaps were small, supercooled water tended to
flow through the gaps and into the MPL [119].

P4.1.2.5. Models of supercooling phenomenon.
PTheoretical models of
the supercooling phenomenon in PEM fuel cells can be found in
[74,98]. A supercooled liquid cluster grows as water is generated
and aggregates until a critical cluster radius is reached. The super-
cooled water is then released and ice is formed, which means that
this spontaneous process leads the unstable supercooled water to a
stable state [98]. The critical cluster radius is influenced by tempera-
ture, as shown in Eq. (26). The increase in supercooling causes a
decrease in critical radius, as shown in Fig. 13. If the critical radius is
on the same scale as the CL pore radius, supercooled water can be
maintained. This corresponds to a supercooling temperature of
¡20 °C.

P4.1.2.6. Suggestions on future supercooling modeling.

models for supercooling still need improvements and have yet to be
submodeled for macroscopic cold-start models. For future modeling

Pprocess, rather than the result of cell degradation. Therefore, super-
cooling could be an explanation for these findings.

PMany factors can affect the transition of supercooled water. For
instance, existing research suggests that substrate surfaces with
higher hydrophobicity provide better conditions to maintain super-
cooled water. Other environmental conditions, such as the humidity
of surrounding gas, ambient flow velocity, and evaporative cooling,
also affect the nucleation rate of supercooled water [67]. In principle,
the liquid phase can be maintained until the temperature decreases
to the crystal homogeneous nucleation temperature which is
¡48.3 °C at standard pressure if no nucleus exists [68].

PReal devices are of course more complex than idealized models.
When water stays freezing temperatures in a liquid state, it can flow
out of porous layers into the flow channel and is then taken away by
the gas flow. In this situation, water can be drained efficiently unless
the rate of water generation is very high; as a result, the fuel cell can
work normally. However, supercooled liquid water can partially
block the pores. Once nucleation is triggered, supercooled water
suddenly freezes to ice, causing the water to block gas supply path-
ways. As a result, a sudden voltage failure occurs to the fuel cell. The
seeds that trigger supercooled water release may be defects of fiber,
cracks, or ice fragments [116]. They are randomly distributed in
porous layers. Vibration can also act as a trigger, since vibration gen-
erates cavitation bubbles, and the collapse of bubbles causes a local
pressure increase, leading to nucleation [118]. Therefore, the phase
change trigger from supercooled liquid to ice could occur at any
time.

PExperiments have been conducted to visualize water and ice dur-
ing cold start, and while some observed supercooled water, others
did not. Ishikawa et al. [6] observed the supercooled water directly
through micrography and found that given certain conditions, liquid
water can remain supercooled and flow out of the CL and GDL.
When the supercooled droplets grow larger than a critical value,
they suddenly freeze. However, other experiments did not detect
the presence of supercooled water. Ge and Wang [32] found that liq-
uid water only emerged at a relatively high temperature (¡3 °C),
since the temperature in the CL exceeded melting point soon after
cold start. When the start temperature was lower than ¡3 °C, only
ice could be found on the CL surface at any given time. Although this
experiment could not prove that supercooled water does not exist
inside the CL, since only the CL surface was observed, the findings
cast some doubt on the existence of supercooled water. The contra-
dicting results from these two experiments also suggest the stochas-
tic behavior of supercooled water.

Fig. 14. Properties of supercooled water as a function of temperature (adapted from
[120(cid:1)122]).

Pwork, two challenges should be considered. First, the properties of
supercooled water are different from that of normal-state water.
Fig. 14 shows the density [120], specific capacity [121], and diffusiv-
ity [122] of supercooled water over a range of temperatures. It is
observed that these properties change significantly with tempera-
ture. Therefore, accurate property data are needed for different types
of porous materials. Second, the presence of supercooled water is
likely to be stochastic [116]. The existence of supercooled water is
very sensitive to conditions; for instance, the transformation of
supercooled water to ice can be triggered by a seed, such as fiber
defects, cracks, or vibrations.

PFrom a practical viewpoint, fuel cell designs should benefit from
the presence of supercooled water to facilitate the cold start. Designs
should also reduce cycle variations to improve the reliability of a
successful cold start. For example, by increasing hydrophobic mate-
rial loading in porous layers, seeds for ice nucleation could be cov-
ered and thus reducing the tendency to freeze [116].

P4.1.2.7. Ice formation in GDL.
PIce formation and melting kinetics in
the GDL were studied [97,100,123]. The differential scanning calo-
rimetry (DSC) method was adopted to experimentally determine the
pseudo steady-state nucleation rates and crystallization rates of
water in the GDL as functions of subcooling. The convolution integral
over nucleation and growth rate is given as follows:

Ppressure and concentration on the outer side of the CL. Thus, more
water flows into the membrane due to the higher concentration and
pressure gradient. As a result, the membrane is better hydrated and
has lower electrical resistance, and output performance is improved.
MPL has a low saturation of liquid due to its hydrophobicity, as illus-
trated in Fig. 15. Therefore, it is also effective at preventing flooding,
especially at a high current density and low temperatures.

P4.1.2.9. Effects of MPL on liquid water transport.
PBefore discussing the
effects of MPL on the cold start, it is necessary to understand how
MPL affects liquid water transport in porous layers. Based on the
results of existing research, we can conclude that the MPL affects the
cold-start process mainly by influencing the transport of super-
cooled water in its liquid state. The key to the effects of MPL is the
structural change of the CL interfacing surface. Fig. 16 shows the
SEM image of the through-plane cross-section of the cathode CL-
MPL-GDL [66]. The three layers have different microstructures and
various porosities. GDL is in a fiber form, and if the MPL is not
inserted between the CL and GDL, there will be large spaces between
the CL and GDL. The MPL is denser than the GDL, so it creates much
smaller gaps between these surfaces.

PMicroporous layers have been widely
used in PEM fuel cells in both laboratory and industry settings [124].
Its effectiveness in improving voltage output in normal operating
conditions has been confirmed. However, the effects of the MPL on
cold-start performance require further discussions.

PMPL can be made hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Hydrophobic MPL
is commonly used to improve operational performance of PEM fuel
cells. The mechanism is that hydrophobic MPL can increase water

PThe improvement of liquid transport with the MPL is not only
critical for the cold start but also benefits operational perfor-
mance. Many studies have observed the distribution of water in
porous media during cell operation through high-resolution neu-
tron imaging or X-ray radiography [125(cid:1)128]. Discontinuous liq-
uid saturation was identified across different layers. This appears
to be due to the continuous capillary pressure in multilayers.
Modeling studies clearly describe this phenomenon [129(cid:1)131].
Liquid water transport in porous media is two-phase transport,
and capillary pressure exists at the interface between liquid and
gas. This is defined as the difference of liquid pressure and gas
pressure:

PBecause the different layers (CL, MPL, and GDL) connect as con-

also be continuous. This means that capillary pressure on each side
of the interface will be equal, as they are both governed by the Lever-
ett function:

POf course, porosity parameters are different for the two layers.
Therefore, water saturation at the interface is supposed to experi-
ence a jump [131], as shown in the diagram in Fig. 15. The jump
magnitude of saturation at the interface mainly depends on the
material's hydrophobicity and pore radius of the two layers.

P4.1.2.10. Effects of MPL on cold start performance.
PThere are fewer
studies focusing on the effects of MPL on the cold start, and these
studies have not
reached a consensus on the mechanisms
[65,116,133]. Some studies found that both hydrophobic and hydro-
philic MPLs can improve cold-start performance [133], while some
studies asserted that hydrophobic MPLs had adverse effects
[65,116]. Yet another study claimed that more ice was formed at the
CL-MPL interface due to the hydrophobic MPL, preventing water
from flowing inside MPL [65]. This situation reportedly deteriorated
the cold-start performance.

PAfter a comprehensive review of existing studies, we conclude
that both hydrophobic and hydrophilic MPLs are capable of improv-
ing cold-start performance; their effects ultimately depend on other
conditions, of which the initial temperature is most important.

PThe hydrophilic MPL improves cold start performance through
simply extending the capacity of the CL, so more ice can be held

Pbefore the failure of the cold start. Thus, the cold start duration can
be longer [65,134].

PThe mechanism of the hydrophobic MPL involves the presence of
supercooled water. As previously discussed in above subsections,
supercooled water is more likely to remain as liquid at higher tem-
peratures and smaller droplet sizes. Therefore, the effects of hydro-
phobic MPLs on the cold start are highly dependent on initial
temperature. When the temperature is relatively high, such as at
¡10 °C, the supercooled liquid is sustained for longer. In this case,
the MPL can force more water to flow into the membrane (the mech-
anism for this has been discussed above). Thus, the membrane
becomes more conductive. More heat can be generated, and the
temperature of the cell increases faster. This is supported by the
finding that the anode MPL effectively improves cold-start perfor-
mance [133]. Humidification in the anode can reduce resistance,
while ice is not likely to block the anode. On the other hand, the
interface of the CL-MPL is less rough than the CL-GDL interface,
which better sustains supercooled water. If the initial temperature is
too low, such as at ¡20 °C, there is a lower chance of supercooled
water flowing into the MPL, and ice is more likely to form inside the
CL or on the CL surface. In this situation, the effect of MPL is less
notable [21].

PFig. 17 illustrates the effects of MPL on the cold start process,
from subfreezing to normal temperatures. We categorize the
cold start process into three distinct stages during the evolution
of temperature. The comparison between the cases with and
without MPL assist in understanding how the MPL impacts trans-
port and cold-start ability. The first stage covers the period
before the temperature in MEA reaches melting point. When the
ionomer is saturated, liquid water appears in a supercooled state
and moves outside the CL. The supercooled liquid can be main-
tain while the radius of the water cluster is smaller than the crit-
ical cluster [98]. The supercooled water accumulates in the pores
of porous media. With smaller pores, the cluster is less likely to
reach that critical value, so the water can maintain its super-
cooled state and move outside the CL. Without MPL, the rough
surface of the GDL contacts the CL to form large gaps. The super-
cooled water at this interface grows larger without confinement,
finally reaching the critical radius and freezing into ice. With
MPL, contact is finer at the interface between the MPL and CL,
and more supercooled water can diffuse out of the CL into MPL.
Thus, there is less ice formation on the surface of the CL allowing
the cold start to last longer. Visualizations of ice on the CL sur-
face after the cold start have confirmed the above discussions
[21]. A recent study compared the rough and smooth interfaces
of the CL-MPL, and the results also confirmed that the interface
structure is the key to the behavior of supercooled water [119].
Thus, it is critical to cold-start performance.

PThe second stage is defined as when MEA temperature reaches
the melting point and ice begins melting. In the case without MPL,
the liquid formed can potentially cause the cathode to flood and
result in performance deterioration due to the massive amount of
ice existing on the surface of the CL [135]. Worse yet, due to the tem-
perature gradient, the temperature of the GDL may be still lower
than the melting point, so the thawed water from the CL may diffuse
into the GDL and freeze again [25]. MPL can also mitigate such prob-
lems in this stage. For example, due to the existence of MPL, less ice
accumulates on the surface of the CL in the first stage. In the second
stage, the improved contact area between the MPL and CL benefits
water draining and prevents CL flooding [21,66].

PIn the third stage, all the ice has been melted. Because the tem-
perature is still low, the evaporation rate is low, and water draining
is relatively inefficient before it reaches normal operation tempera-
ture. The MPL is also important at this stage, as it improves water
draining.

4.2. Gas species transport

P4.2.1. Flow channels

PAs discussed above, ice formation in the cathode flow channel
may cause a pressure drop in the airstream, which leads to a non-

where f is the friction factor, ξi is the bend loss coefficient of the ith
bend. In cases of blockage, additional pressure loss may occur. The
blockage effect of a droplet is associated with droplet size and con-
tact angle.

P4.1.3. Flow channels

PFlow channels act as pathways for supplying reactants and drain-
ing water products. The primary transport process in the flow chan-
nel is convection due to its large size. As observed in an experiment,
ice formation may occur in the flow channel when starting at a rela-
tively high subfreezing temperature, such as ¡7 °C [25]. The temper-
ature of the CL and GDL exceeded melting point due to localized
heat generation. Liquid water then flowed out of porous layers and
into the flow channel. However, the temperature of the flow channel
was still lower than the freezing point. As a result, water froze in the
flow channel and blocked the pathway, leading to a high pressure
drop and quick voltage failure, as shown in Fig. 18. To avoid the ice
blockage in the flow channel, the interdigitated flow channel design
resulted in better performance than the parallel channel [136]. The
interdigitated channel enhanced water back-diffusion into the mem-
brane. This design benefited membrane hydration and therefore
resulted in higher conductivity. It also reduced the amount of water

PDuring a cold start, ice and liquid in porous layers can prevent
reactants from contact with the catalysts, also resulting in voltage
failure. Ice and liquid block reactants from flowing into the CL. Ice in
the CL also covers the surface, thus reducing the electrochemical
active area (ECA).

PGas species transport in the CL should consider the Knudsen dif-
fusion because the pore diameter of the CL tends to be very small
and of the order of the mean free path [99]. The Knudsen diffusion
can be given in the form of Fick's law:

PThe reaction occurs in the catalyst layer. Therefore, heat from the
electrochemical reaction is a major heating source from the CL, and
it can be calculated as activational heat and reversible heat. Ohmic
heat is another major source of heat, especially when the water con-
tent in ionomer is low (creating high resistance) or the operational
current is high. Latent heat from water phase changes (evaporation
and ice formation) also contributes to the CL. All the above-men-
tioned four heating sources are compiled in Eq. (45).

cient
should be
determined based on the morphology of the ice formed in the CL.
However, it is challenging to measure ice morphology in the CL,
since the formation characteristics are sensitive to cold-start condi-
tions and ice formation processes show random behaviors. In mod-
els, these values are defined by assumptions. Some studies used 1
for ta, 1.5 for td, [5,77], while others used 0.5 for ta and 1.5 for td
[94]. Mishler et al. [30] found that an ice fraction-dependent ta can
produce better agreement with experiments. Clearly, a better under-
standing of the supercooling phenomena would lead to an improved
understanding of ice blockage.

4.3. Heat transfer and heat sources

PThe thermal conductivity of the membrane is usually assumed to
be a constant in PEM fuel cell modeling studies, although it has been
found that thermal conductivity varies notably depending on water
content. Burheim et al. [138] examined the dependency of the ther-
mal conductivity of NafionTM as a function of water content. The
results indicated that the thermal conductivity of the NafionTM could
be enhanced by increasing water content, as shown in Eq. (43).

erned by Eq. (44).

where λw is the water content, rw(kg m¡3) is the water density,
kw(W K¡1 m¡1) is the water thermal conductivity, cSO3 (mol m¡3) is
¡ ion, and knf (W K¡1 m¡1) is the
the molar concentration of the SO3
thermal conductivity of the dry membrane. The thermal conductiv-
ity of water increases with temperature, whereas the situation is
reversed for a dry membrane. Therefore, the humidified membrane's
thermal conductivity is essentially determined by the two effects
combined.

PDuring a cold start, the rising temperature in the CL determines
the performance of a successful start-up. The thermal resistance of
the CL is obtained by measuring the MEA resistance and membrane
resistance. It depends on porosity, ionomer content, and platinum
load. It is also influenced by installation pressure [71]. While the cat-
alyst layer is relatively thin in the through-plane direction, low ther-
mal resistance causes a low temperature gradient. A more important
factor is the heating source.

4.4. Charge transport

PThe proton transport process depends on water content and
water state, and water state corresponds to temperature, as dis-
cussed above [5]. When membrane water freezes, the ionic conduc-
tivity of the membrane drops sharply.

PCharge transport in the CL involves the electron transport in car-
bon/Pt and proton transport in ionomer. Due to the porous structure
and composition of ionomer and carbon, the effective charge trans-
port coefficients can be calculated based on the volume of the con-
ductive medium. Different approximations can be used to correct
the charge transport coefficients, such as the Bruggeman approxima-
tion, Looyenga approximation, and generalized Maxwell equa-
tion [139].

4.5. Summary

PIn this section, the transport phenomena of the cold start, as
based on various experimental observations and theoretical studies,
were discussed. Water transport in the membrane is influenced by
water content and temperature, and the freezing ability of mem-
brane water is dominated by the bonding of sulfonic groups and
molecular membrane structures. Water transport in porous layers is
a key factor in cold-start performance. Supercooled water is more
likely to emerge when initial temperature is high, current density is
high, and the initial state is dry. In ideal conditions, supercooled
water remains in the CL, where pores are small. When supercooled
water flows out from the CL, it accumulates in the gaps between CL
and GDL. Liquid droplets grow and then suddenly freeze when their
size exceeds a critical value. In real conditions, the nucleation of
supercooled water is a stochastic behavior, which can be triggered
by randomly distributed cracks, fiber defects, and ice fragments.
Hydrophobic MPLs can improve cold-start performance in certain
temperature ranges by forcing more water to flow into the mem-
brane and preventing ice formation on the CL surface. Hydrophilic
MPLs can also improve cold-start performance by extending the ice
capacity of the CL. To obtain more precise simulation results, future
cold-start modeling should consider the behavior of supercooled
water and the effect of MPLs.

5. Optimizations

PFundamental studies on the PEM fuel cell cold start have pro-
vided insight into the key factors that influence the ability of the
start-up. For practical purposes, these key factors can be informative
for cold-start optimization, so that more critical cold-start perfor-
mance requirements can be achieved for FCV commercialization.

PThe improvement of cold-start performance is not merely an issue of
rapid heating. It should be examined in conjunction with fuel econ-
omy, system stability, and operation simplification. In this section,
we categorize the optimization routes for the cold start into three
aspects: design and material parameters, starting load control strat-
egies, and assisted cold start with external energy.

5.1. Design optimization

PPEM fuel cell cold-start performance can be optimized through
better-designed parameters and choice of materials. Studies suggest
that the optimization of critical cell components (such as the mem-
brane, CL, MPL, GDL, and BP) and efficient designs at the stack and
system level can improve cold-start performance. For a summary of
research results and suggestions on design parameter optimization,
see Table S3 in Supplementary Materials.

P5.1.1. Membrane

PAs shown in Table S3, optimization of the membrane focuses
on water-uptake ability and conductivity at subfreezing tempera-
tures. The idea is simple: if more water can be absorbed in the
membrane, less ice will be formed and the start-up will be more
likely to succeed. One particular method of achieving this is to
reduce the thickness of the membrane [104]. They analyzed
three types of NafionTM with different thicknesses (NafionTM 117,
115 and 112). It was found that the thinner membrane (NafionTM
112) is most beneficial to the cold start. The water concentration
gradient of the thinner membrane is greater than that of the
thicker membranes. This results in a higher rate of water absorp-
tion, so ice accumulates at a slower rate with the thinner mem-
brane. The water capacity of
the membrane can also be
improved by using advanced materials [140]. The pure NafionTM
membrane was compared to a composite membrane of SiO2 and
Zr(HPO4)2 nanoparticles. Experimental results showed that the
composite membrane contained more free water, allowing for
better performance of the cold start.

PLow temperatures can lead to reduced conductivity of the mem-
brane, causing serious voltage degradation. Some studies claimed
that there was no noticeable phase transition in the membrane dur-
ing the cold start, based on in-situ experiments, since temperature
increased significantly in the membrane [43]. Nevertheless, there
are experiments that observed a sudden change in ion conductivity
of the membrane when temperature decreased, suggesting a possi-
ble freeze in the membrane [148]. The freezing of membrane water
was found to be correlated to membrane nanostructures [33,108]
and chemical composition [33]. The pore diameter of the membrane
significantly affects the depression of the freezing point. As for the
nature of the membrane, two types of membranes (NafionTM and
sulfonated polyimide) were compared [33]. Special behaviors were
observed for the hydrocarbon-based membrane: water did not
freeze upon cooling and also did not desorb upon annealing. These
behaviors are explained by the strong affinity between the novel
membrane material and water. This characteristic is favorable to the
cold start by preventing water diffusion to the catalyst layer and ice
formation in the pores. However, there are concerns about the sta-
bility of this type of membrane; more research should be proposed
to examine its durability in freezing conditions.

P5.1.2. Catalyst layer

PIn the catalyst layer, critical factors affecting the cold start
include ionomer content, Pt/carbon ratio, composition, and thick-
ness. By increasing the fraction of ionomer in the CL, the rate of ice
accumulation can be effectively reduced, since the higher ionomer
fraction can absorb more water and drive more water to diffuse into
the membrane [104]. Hiramitsu et al. also experimentally confirmed
the advantages of higher ionomer fractions, and they reasoned that

Pthe benefits come from better oxygen permeation in the ice-blocked
catalyst layer [17].

PElectrode thickness also affects the water capacity of the mem-
brane. Thompson et al. [45] found that the maximum water content
in the membrane for a thick electrode (14.1 mm) is around 14, while
for a thin electrode (3.5 mm), the maximum water content is around
15. Although a cold start favors a thick catalyst layer, this increases
precious metal loading and may deteriorate durability. An ultrathin
CL is prone to flooding, especially at a lower initial temperature
[141]. To remedy the performance loss caused by the ultrathin CL,
some strategies were proposed, such as using a thicker membrane
and drying the membrane before start-up.

PThe effects of the platinum-to-carbon support ratio in the cata-
lyst layer cathode were also studied [142]. It was found that a lower
platinum/carbon support ratio was more likely to reduce the rate of
ice formation. As for the composition of CL materials, it was found
that the addition of silica in the cathode catalyst layer could improve
water capacity and therefore improve the time sustained during the
cold start [143].

P5.1.3. Microporous layer

PMicroporous layers can be added between the CL and GDL to
improve the transport process. Studies have found that the MPL
can improve cold-start performance, as it expands ice capacity in
the CL [134,144] and reduces water accumulation on the surface
of the CL [21]. A dual-functionality MPL was designed for both
normal operation and cold start [134,144]. In normal operation
conditions, the MPL exhibits better water management, as it
improves the water draining ability of the GDL [149]. In the cold
start,
its major function is to expand the ice capacity of CL,
therefore reducing the risk of ice blockage in the CL. Another
study also found that MPL improves cold-start performance by
reducing ice accumulation on the CL surface [21]. This is through
the better contact between the MPL and CL, which benefits water
removal from the surface.

POn the other hand, freeze damage to the CL resulting from ice
expansion may be intensified by the MPL, because water is con-
strained within smaller spaces at the interface of the CL and MPL.
When ice is formed at the interface between the CL and MPL, the
resulting pressure could be higher than in the absence of the MPL,
and hence more severe CL pinhole damage or micro-cracking could
occur. This could delaminate the catalyst layer from the GDL
[145,150].

P5.1.4. Gas diffusion layer

PAs for the GDL, its pore size and thickness are two key factors
influencing cold-start performance. Hirakata et al. [76] studied the
effects of GDL pore size. They found that a GDL with smaller pores is
favorable to the cold start, as it worked longer at a constant current
at ¡5 °C. They further analyzed the effects of ice formation on the
reaction area and found that the reaction area of the catalyst layer
was maintained even after ice formation and apparent cell potential
decrement. The study showed that voltage failure is mainly due to
the loss of reactant gas transport rather than the blockage of reaction
sites. They also found that the GDL has no effect on the cold start at
temperatures below ¡10 °C because water would freeze before it
could flow into the GDL. Dursch et al. [97] investigated the charac-
teristics of ice melting in the GDL. They formulated an equation (Eq.
(46)), which related GDL thickness (L) and thermal conductivity (k).
This equation suggests that a thinner GDL could accelerate ice melt-
ing and therefore is favorable to the cold start.

P5.1.5. Flow channels

P5.2.2. Voltage

PInterdigitated, parallel, and serpentine patterns are commonly
used PEM fuel cell flow channel designs. Interdigitated flow-field is
favored over the parallel design in the constant current start-up
mode, since the interdigitated flow-field enhances water removal
from under-land GDL through convective mass transport [136]. At a
lower start-up current density, the fuel cell with an interdigitated
flow channel successfully started up from ¡6 °C, while the parallel
flow channel fuel cell could only sustain ¡4 °C under the same con-
ditions. As for the effects of flow direction, both experimental and
modeling studies have found that the influence either of co-flow or
counter-flow are negligible because the cathode flow dominates
other cold-start characteristics [25,89].

P5.1.6. Stack

PIn PEM fuel cell stack design, two factors primarily affect cold
start ability: the material and structure of bipolar plates. Metallic
materials have many advantages when applied to bipolar plates. In
terms of the cold start, metallic bipolar plates can reduce the ther-
mal mass of the stack, thus speeding up the cold-start process [93].
However, metallic bipolar plates are more likely to suffer from corro-
sion and high mechanical stress during the cold start [146]. The per-
formance of metallic bipolar plates can be improved by depositing
vanadium oxide polycrystalline [147]. The negative temperature
coefficient feature of the film is favorable for the cold start, since it
becomes a self-heating source in the cold start process. As for the
endplates, high thermal conductivity causes an increase in start-up
time due to the fact that the high conductivity contributes to a
higher heat dissipation rate to the cold ambient [93].

5.2. Load control

PHardware provides foundations for cold-start performance opti-
mization, and operating strategies, such as load control, can further
enhance the cold start in more convenient and efficient ways.

P5.2.1. Current

PThe constant-current cold start mode is used in many experimen-
tal and modeling studies. Since current is easily controlled, the con-
stant-current mode is advantageous for stabilizing flow rates in
experiments. Optimizing current density generally encompasses
two approaches. One is based on the heat utilized before a shutdown
occurring after full ice blockage [43,44]. In this case, a lower start-up
current density favors a low rate of water generation, allowing more
time for the ionomer to uptake water and more time for the accumu-
lation of ice in the CL pores. Although the heat generation rate would
be lower compared to a high current density start-up, the total heat-
ing time would be longer, and as a result, more overall heat could be
utilized. The other perspective focuses on the competition between
rising temperature and ice accumulation [104]. It is reasoned that
the higher final temperature at the end of the failed cold start sug-
gests the higher possibility of a successful startup. Based on this
view, a higher current density would be favorable because of the
higher heat generation rate for the same amount of water produced.
PAnother method for improving the cold start is current-ramping
[103]. This strategy was developed based on earlier findings.
Research suggests that lower operational current density slows
down ice formation rate, while higher current density contributes to
a rapid warm-up. Linear current-ramping start-up combines both of
these advantages. At the initial low current, ice is prevented from
forming; as the temperature rises and the operational current
increases, since the water capacity has already been increased, ice
formation remains at a low rate, even as more water is produced.

PAlthough the constant-voltage mode is harder to control,
studies have shown it to be superior to the constant-current
mode [5,86,104]. Low-voltage operation can maintain a high rate
of heat generation during the entire cold-start process [104].
Compared to the constant-current start mode, the constant-volt-
age start-up can produce more waste heat and hence enables the
cell to reach a higher final temperature. Faster heat-up can be
achieved when a lower voltage is applied [87]. Therefore, the
PEM fuel cell is more likely to survive a cold start at a lower
voltage. In practical applications, such as FCVs, low-voltage oper-
ation is commonly applied during the cold-start period. Unfortu-
nately, this compromises output power and efficiency to achieve
rapid heating. The constant voltage start-up mode can be created
by regulating the current with a DC-DC converter [151(cid:1)153].
Generally,
the method of converting entails raising voltage
through a boost converter, at the cost of reducing current den-
sity, or by reducing voltage through a buck converter.

P5.2.3. Power

PIn practical application, fuel cells are usually favored to operate
with a constant load to obtain optimum performance and efficiency,
such as when fuel cells are used as a part of a hybrid system in
vehicles [154,155]. The power-controlled cold start modes will be
discussed in this subsection. In particular, the constant power mode
and maximum power mode will be analyzed.

PThe characteristics of cold-start failure in the constant power
mode are shown in Fig. 19 [156]. In this case, a 20-cell stack started
up from ¡20 (cid:7)C with a constant power of 80 W. As shown in Fig. 19
(a), due to the increase in membrane resistance, current density
decreased sharply. A defining characteristic of the constant power
start-up is the high starting current density. The high current causes
a sudden redistribution of membrane water in the MEA through the
electro-osmotic drag effect. Thus, there is a sharp decrease of water
content in the anode CL. As a result, the total resistance of the cell
increases and current density sharply drops in the first few seconds.
Fig. 19(b) and (c) show the evolution of the polarization curves dis-
played in the power(cid:1)current density (P(cid:1)I) pattern and the volta-
ge(cid:1)current density (V(cid:1)I) pattern, respectively. The polarization
curves move downward in this figure, which indicates the degrada-
tion of performance during the cold start. The peak value of the low-
est curve is the same as the operational power (80 W), and this point
indicates the moment of failure for the constant-power cold start.
Even though the pores of the cathode CL were not fully obstructed
by ice at this point as shown in Fig. 19(a), the starting process termi-
nated because the required power output could not be maintained
after this moment.

PIn addition to constant-power operation, the fuel cell can be
started with maximum power output to quickly reach full load.
In a failed maximum-power cold start, power output drops
sharply due to a large ohmic loss, caused by fast dehydration on
the anode side of MEA (driven by EOD effect). It then decreases
steadily until complete failure. If the temperature in the MEA
reaches melting point, ice in the CL will melt and drain, which
would improve operating conditions. Power output rises and
tends to stabilize as the ice melts completely and liquid drainage
becomes steady. The maximum power mode was found to be the
most survivable cold-start mode, especially when the fuel cell
started from an extremely low temperature [157]. The advan-
tages of the maximum power mode can be explained by the heat
generation characteristics, as shown in Fig. 20. As opposed to the
constant-voltage mode in which the heat generation rate drops
in later stages, heat generation increases constantly after the first
drop stage in the maximum-power cold start mode. This advan-
tage is critical for the rapid warm-up.

Passisted cold start methods are summarized in Table S4
[16,92,94,104,158(cid:1)170] in Supplementary Materials.

P5.3.1. Purging

PSeveral studies have found that conditions prior to a cold start are
critical to a successful cold start; these conditions especially include
initial water content in the membrane and catalyst layer [79, 87].
The purge process has been widely studied through experimental
[158,161,171(cid:1)173] and modeling [173(cid:1)175] studies.

PThe purge process can be described in four stages, as shown in
Fig. 21 [174,175]. First, the purge gas flows through the flow channel
and blows away water droplets on the channel walls. There are sev-
eral experimental [176(cid:1)179] and modeling studies [180(cid:1)183] that
focus on this two-phase flow problem. Second, liquid water in the
GDL pores is removed by evaporation and the driving force comes
from capillary pressure [184,185]. Afterwards, the liquid water in
the CL pores is removed. Finally, the membrane water in ionomer
evaporates. As the amount of liquid water in the CL pores is reduced,
the surface area of ionomer exposed to gas increases, which further
accelerates the removal of membrane water.

PThere are several indicators that reflect the level of purge effec-
tiveness. The first is cell resistance [161,172]. Since the resistance of
the membrane and CLs is strongly affected by water content, the effi-
ciency of drying can be evaluated by measuring cell resistance. The
second is the dew point temperature of the purge gas at exit, which
indicates the amount of water contained in the gas [161]. Thirdly,
the weight of MEA also shows the extent of drying. Visualizing the
GDL and CL is another direct method to observe and quantify the
effectiveness of water removal through purging [161]. Two mass
transport parameters that determine purge performance were found
[172]. One is the diffusivity in the CL and GDL. The other is the con-
vection of vapor in the gas flow channel. This is confirmed by com-
paring the purge effects between N2 and helium. Because the water
vapor diffusivity of helium is much higher than that of N2, a helium
purge results in better performance.

PPractical applications of PEM fuel cells require high purge effec-
tiveness and a short purge duration. The conventional purging
method still needs further development. Several novel purging strat-
egies can be found in literature, as shown in Table S4 in Supplemen-
tary Materials. Tang et al. [158] experimentally studied a vacuum-
assisted purge method, which was first presented by Fuss [159] in a
patent. Nitrogen is used as the purging gas, which minimizes the
degradation of the CL. The vacuum-assisted method has high purge
efficiency while consuming less purging gas, an important advantage
for on-board applications. The HFR test shows that high-pressure,

5.3. Assisted start-up

PThis paper defines the assisted cold start as a positive cold-start
method with auxiliary equipment or methods in addition to the
essential components in a fuel cell system. Optimizations of starting
modes are not included. As revealed in fundamental research, the
key factor to a successful cold start is the ratio of cell warm-up time
constant to ice accumulation rate [77]. Therefore, purging and heat-
ing are two essential aspects of the assisted cold start. Various

Pvacuum-assisted drying is the most effective method among the
tested cases. However, the mechanical stress on the MEA would be
higher with high pressure gradients, so the pressure should be lim-
ited. An experiment was conducted that introduced a small amount
of hydrogen into the cathode air-purge flow [161]. The catalytic
hydrogen-oxygen reaction in the CL improved the ability of the
purge to remove water, especially compared to a purge using only
air. This was very effective at drying the catalyst layer. Subsequent
cold start tests after using the new purge strategies also exhibited
better performance.

PAlthough gas purging can effectively remove residual water in
the PEM fuel cell and improve cold-start performance, it may cause
degradation problems in catalyst layers. Furthermore, the extra
energy consumption and increase in cold-start time also must be
considered for practical applications [174]. Future development of
rapid purge methods can focus on inflicting less damage to the cata-
lyst layers.

P5.3.2. Heating

PIn automotive applications, the extra heat provided to fuel cells
for starting up in subfreezing environments can be categorized into
two types: the warm-parking method and the positive heating
method [7]. The warm-parking method requires a continuous supply
of energy and is not optimal for long parking times. Some studies
have presented strategies to improve warm-keeping performance,
such as using phase-change materials [96] or using porous water-
transport plates to slow down ice formation after shutting down in
freezing conditions [186].

PHere, discussion will focus on the positive heating method. Extra
heat can be provided from various energy sources. It is important to
analyze and compare the effectiveness, availability, and energy con-
sumption level of these heating sources.

P5.3.2.1. Electric heating.
PThe major advantage of electric heating is
the flexibility in control, which benefits the relatively complicated
assisted cold-start strategies. Many proposed patents for assisted
cold-start methods are based on electric heating, as shown in Table
S4 in Supplementary Materials [164,187]. Zhou et al. presented a
novel variable heating and load-control assisted cold-start method
using an electric heater as the heating source [94]. As shown in
Fig. 22, a 100 W electric heating source is distributed along a 20-cell
stack. The inner cells are usually started first, and the waste heat is
used to heat up the adjacent cells, which allows a successful cold
start of the stack at ¡20 °C.

P5.3.2.2. Gas heating.
POther assisted fuel cell cold-start patents are
based on the gas heating method [16,188,189]. The effects of inlet
temperature on cold-start performance were studied [5,16,93,104].
One such study compared two inlet gas conditions. The inlet gas
temperatures were either set equal to the ambient temperature or
equal to the cell temperature; based on the evolution of current den-
sity, the results showed negligible differences in cold-start perfor-
mance [5]. In this simulation, the inlet gas temperature that was
equal to the cell temperature was not much higher than the ambient
temperature. More notable effects on cold-start performance were
found by further increasing the inlet gas temperature [104]. The inlet
gas temperatures of ¡20 °C and 80 °C were compared. At the higher
inlet gas temperature, current density dropped slower. However, the
start-up still failed even when the inlet gas temperature was at 80 °
C. Two caveats about these results should be mentioned. Firstly, this
model only considered a straight channel in a cell; therefore, com-
pared to a full-size single cell or stack, the heat carried by the high
temperature inlet gas would not be effectively utilized before the
gas flowed out of the straight channel. Secondly, only the cathode
side was heated up; due to the lower heat transfer coefficient of air
compared to hydrogen, heating the cathode side is much less effi-
cient than heating the anode side [93]. More reasonable results of

found by D€obereiner that hydrogen and oxygen can react slowly on
a platinum surface at room temperature [193]. The fundamental
mechanism has been explained in detail [194]. The application of
the catalytic reaction to assist the PEM cold start is straightforward
[195(cid:1)197]. Several patents on this method have been made
[166,198(cid:1)202]. The catalytic reaction can occur at low temperatures
and the reaction gases are readily available from the reactant supply
system, making it suitable for PEM fuel cells.

stack, starting from ¡20 °C at 0.15 A cm¡2. The two end surfaces are thermally insu-
lated, and an external heating power of 100 W is evenly applied to the 6 middle cells
(adapted from [94]).

Pthe effect of inlet gas temperature can be found in [16]. The experi-
ment showed that a cold start from ¡10 °C failed when the inlet gas
temperature was at 60 °C and succeeded when the inlet gas was at
80 °C.

P5.3.2.3. Coolant heating.
PThere are several patents using the coolant
heating method for the assisted cold start [170,190(cid:1)192]. Some
studies have mentioned that the stack can warm up quickly by pass-
ing through hot coolant during the cold start [92,93,95]. One advan-
tage of this method is that in a practical situation, hot coolant can be
obtained from various sources. Hot coolant can come from electricity
consumption (for example, in a hybrid vehicle with fuel cells and an
internal combustion engine) as well as from fuel cell stack coolant,
which can be heated by the engine's waste heat. Another benefit of
this method is that the warm-up process can be uniform and effi-
cient, as the coolant channels are evenly distributed inside the stack.
It also avoids having to install extra accessories, a downside of the
direct electric heating method.

PA problem with this method is the relatively high heat capacity of
coolant, which could lead to higher energy consumption. This issue
may slow down the cold start process, considering that the coolant,
itself a large thermal mass, needs more time to heat up. Some cold
start research recommends the deactivation of coolant loops during
the cold start [24].

PTwo schemes can be applied to the internal hydrogen-oxygen
catalytic reaction to assist the cold start. These are based on whether
or not the catalytic reaction activated simultaneously with the start-
up. In other words, the first type of scheme is the application of the
catalytic reaction on the catalyst layer before the fuel cell starts
working. The fuel cell is initiated when the cell is warmed up to a
proper condition; for instance, an average temperature above 0 °C
[165]. The second type is to simultaneously apply the catalytic reac-
tion with the cold-start process [167]. The reactions in anode and
cathode CLs are as follows:

PAs shown in Fig. 23, if the air-to-hydrogen ratio is high enough
(within the explosion limit), a cold start at ¡20 °C could be success-
ful. When the temperature of MEA exceeds melting point before the
cathode CL is fully blocked, the ice melts and leads to a successful
cold start (Fig. 24).

PThe external burning of the hydrogen-oxy-

gen method can be found in multiple patents [203(cid:1)206]. It is a high-
efficiency method that rapidly heats up the fuel cell stack, since the
controlled catalytic burning of a hydrogen-oxygen mixture is already
well developed [207(cid:1)212]. Even with these advantages, this method
is not practically feasible for automobile applications due to the
increased weight and volume of the extra burner. Adding complexi-
ties to the installation and control of auxiliary components also
presents further problems.

5.4. Summary

PIn this section, the optimization strategies for improving PEM
fuel cell cold-start performance are discussed. Optimization meth-
ods are categorized into three types: improving the structure and
material of cell components, optimizing operation modes, and

6. Challenges and opportunities

6.1. Existing challenges and expected improvements

PThe major challenges of the PEM fuel cell cold start can be catego-
rized into three aspects. The first is the understanding of the water
phase transition phenomenon. The second is the modeling tech-
nique, which can balance both microscopic modeling and large-scale
system level modeling. The third is the gap between cold-start per-
formance requirements and existing technologies.

P6.1.1. Liquid(cid:1)ice transition theory

PIce formation from liquid water occurs commonly during the cold
start, but its nature and characteristics are still unclear, given the
complex conditions of the cold start process. In literature, the pri-
mary level of cold start studies ignored the presence of ice. These
studies mainly focused on thermal management. Later, advanced
second-level studies captured the ice formation process with empir-
ical equations, either in lumped models or multiphase numerical
models. Although these studies were able to demonstrate the impact
of ice formation on the cold start process, their empirical descrip-
tions have proven to be inadequate. For example, empirical models
cannot explain stochastic performance variations [29] and the pres-
ence of supercooled water [65] during the cold start. Third-level
studies focused on the supercooling phenomenon and have been
able to improve theories on ice formation [6,98]. Two issues still
remain with regards to liquid-ice transition research. The first is that
this theory is based on several hypotheses that cannot be validated
by experiments thus far. The second issue is that these theoretical
models are limited to simply describing the supercooling phenome-
non itself. The supercooling theories have not yet been integrated
into a complete cold-start model for the full-scale fuel cell.

PImprovements in the ice formation theory require detailed
experimental observations. Therefore, experimental
techniques
must be improved with the goal of observing dynamic nano-scale
transport phenomena in the cold start. As reviewed in Section 2,
existing experiments provide some unique techniques to observe
water at the nano-scale in PEM fuel cells, such as CRYO-SEM [61].
The CRYO-SEM method can visualize nano-scale water distribution
in the CL, but due to its static nature, it is unable to capture the liq-
uid-ice transition process. Some other techniques, such as neutron
imaging, can capture the dynamics of ice formation, but observations
currently cannot be made in nano-scale measurements; the resolu-
tion of the neutron imaging technique is at the 10 mm level [54,55].

P6.1.2. Multi-scale modeling

PMulti-scale modeling strikes a balance between the microscopic
level and large-scale system level models and are useful for future
studies of the cold start. It is still difficult to achieve, primarily due
to the limited understanding of microscopic phenomena and its high
computational cost.

PAlthough pore-scale modeling has been achieved for water trans-
port in the GDL and CL, consideration of the ice formation mecha-
nism at the pore-scale level is still limited within the scope of
theoretical analysis [59,61,109]. There are no numerical models for
pore-scale simulation of the cold start process. One of the major
challenges is the lack of understanding of the ice formation mecha-
nism at this level, although there are already exist some studies on
ice formation characteristics in a confined space [213,214] and at
the nano-scale [215]. Ice formation in the catalyst layer of PEM fuel
cell is especially complex due to the nature of the catalyst layer,
which is composed of various materials. The pore size distributions
are stochastic, and the properties of the interface are difficult to pre-
cisely control. Therefore, to alleviate these challenges, improve-
ments could be made to develop a better theory regarding the ice
formation mechanism in the cold start, as mentioned above.

the cathode catalyst layer with a constant-current cold start with 21.3%% air mole
fractions in the gas mixture at the anode inlet (adapted from [167]).

Pproviding extra energy to effectively remove residual water and to
achieve rapid heating. For the first type, structural design optimiza-
tion, it is critical to maintain free water content and the conductivity
of the membrane. For the catalyst layer, water absorption is essential
for improving cold-start performance. This favors bipolar plates with
lower heat capacity. In the second type, operation modes for the cold
start include current control, voltage control, and power control. The
constant-power and constant-voltage modes are better at improving
cold-start performance, compared to the constant-current mode.
Although the assisted cold start tends to be more effective, the feasi-
bility and reliability of the various methods need to be considered,
especially for applications in compact products (such as the FCV),
which require lighter and smaller fuel cell systems. Applying an
assisted cold start method to a PEM fuel cell system is more complex
than the mere addition of system components; the interactions
between the subsystems must also be considered.

PComputational costs tend to be high for a variety of reasons. The grid
or lattice size must be small enough to capture the features of pores,
since pore size in the CL varies from the nano-level to the micro-
level. Additionally, since the cold start process involves many trans-
ports and chemical reactions, numerous equations must be solved
simultaneously. To reduce computational costs, pore-scale modeling
is presently limited to the fuel cell scale. Code optimization should
be considered for improving computational efficiency [216].

P6.1.3. Gap between required performance and existing technologies

PFor cold start issues, a practical aim is improving the cold start
ability without reducing its durability. Although there are many
existing strategies for cold-start performance optimization, as
reviewed in Section 5, there are some gaps in technical knowledge.
Start-up time is one of these problems. Most of the existing assisted
cold-start strategies require a relatively long time for heating so that
cold starts can be successful when starting at extremely low temper-
atures. However, in practical applications, such as FCVs, start-up
times need to be short enough for practical convenience. Another
challenge is the compromise between performance and durability.
Typically, the rapid cold start requires a much higher current density
than in normal operation for the purposes of obtaining more waste
heat [217]. Therefore, cold start operation tends to accelerate the
degradation of electrodes. The trade-off between cold start ability
and durability also exists on a material level. Optimal cold-start per-
formance requires higher porosity of the catalyst layers, which
allows them to withstand more ice and obtain a larger active area
that promotes electrochemical reactions. However, these features
generally result in a more unstable catalyst layer [218], thus leading
to lower durability.

6.2. Opportunities

P6.2.1. Experimental studies

PBased on reviews of existing studies and analyses of cold-start
challenges, four trends emerge in possible opportunities for future
cold start research. One such field is the improvement of experimen-
tal techniques. Sophisticated experimental techniques, such as
nano-scale observation [219,220], should be explored, enabling the
observation of transport phenomena during the cold start process.

P6.2.2. Modeling studies

PBecause critical water phase changes and mass transfers both
occur at the interface of electrolytes, catalysts, and carbon backbone
in the CL, it is important to comprehensively understand the inter-
face phenomena with pore-scale modeling, especially for ice forma-
tion characteristics. So far, models for water transport in pores
include the volume-of-fluid (VOF) model [185], pore-network model
[221], and lattice Boltzmann model [222, 223], though perhaps only
the lattice Boltzmann model is appropriate for the small pores in the
catalyst layer. Future efforts can be made to model water phase
change and ice morphology in the GDL and MPL. Importantly, these
modeling techniques can be applied to the CL with electrochemical
reactions.

P6.2.3. Model uncertainty

PAnalyzing model uncertainty is another important aspect of cold-
start modeling studies. For the PEM fuel cell cold start model, alea-
tory uncertainties exist due to the stochastic behavior of physical
phenomena, such as the presence and release of supercooled water.
Epistemic uncertainties also exist due to the difficulty in accurately
measuring material properties, such as conductivity and reactivity
of the catalyst layer. Future modeling studies should pay attention
to model uncertainties. Model validation can be done by system-
level experiments which measure cold-start performance, as well as

Pby component-level experiments, which can validate material prop-
erties and fundamental theories.

P6.2.4. Material development

PMaterial development is a possible major approach for further
optimization of cold-start performance. Emphasis can be made in
particular on the nano-structure design of electrode materials, as
well as graphene-based electrode materials. The trade-off between
cold start ability and durability is one of the major issues that can be
resolved through material development. Future studies can focus on
promoting the coupling of catalyst particles and graphene-based
materials to improve both cold-start performance and durability
[218].

7. Concluding remarks

PTwo important aspects of the cold start in proton exchange mem-
brane (PEM) fuel cells involve transport phenomena and startup per-
formance optimization. Fundamental studies through experiments
and mathematical modeling are first reviewed. Transport phenom-
ena during the cold-start process are then systematically discussed.
The transport phenomena are summarized based on existing find-
ings in various areas of research, such as output performance mea-
surement, water and ice visualization, and theoretical model
predictions. Next, cold-start performance optimization strategies
are discussed, spanning topics such as enhanced material and struc-
ture, proper load control, and auxiliary system assistance. Finally,
the challenges and opportunities facing cold-start research are dis-
cussed. Some important conclusions are addressed as follows:

P1. The deterioration of fuel cell output performance during the cold
start is strongly affected by water transport and ice formation
processes, such as the presence of supercooled liquid water, ice
formation in porous layers, and ice blockage of the flow channel.
Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism resulting in
cold-start failure requires experimental methods, such as X-ray
tomographic microscopy and CRYO-SEM, to reveal more about
water transport and phase change.

P2. Cold start models are developed at different levels of complexity
with different methods. Each type of model suits a certain
research purpose. Analytical cold start models often simplify
fuel cell dimensions to zero in order to focus on interactions
between key processes during the cold start, such as water bal-
ance, energy balance, and output performance. Analytical mod-
els are efficient tools for studying fundamental theories about
the cold start. Numerical models can be implemented in various
dimensions. They provide comprehensive details about the cold
start process in full-scale cells. Thus, numerical models can be
used to guide cell structure and material design for optimizing
cold-start performance.

P3. Supercooling is one of the most important transport phenomena
in the cold start. Correlations between supercooled water and
cold-start characteristics remain debated. Existing experimental
findings show that supercooled water tends to stay in the liquid
state in small pores of the catalyst layer. When it flows out and
accumulates in larger gaps, such as the interface between the
catalyst layer and the gas diffusion layer (GDL), this supercooled
liquid water is more likely to freeze as droplets grow in size. The
nucleation of supercooled water can be triggered by cracks, ice
fragments, and defects of fiber, which are randomly distributed.
Therefore, the freezing of supercooled water is likely a stochastic
process. Understanding the supercooling phenomenon may
assist in explaining some interesting behaviors in the cold start,
such as the cycle variation of output performance during
repeated cold starts.

P4. The latest fuel cell designs commonly utilize microporous layers
(MPLs) to improve cold-start performance. For hydrophilic
MPLs, cold start performance is improved though increasing the
ice capacity of the catalyst layer, thus prolonging the duration of
the cold start. Hydrophobic MPLs enhance the cold start ability
in certain temperature ranges by forcing more water into the
membrane and preventing ice formation on the surface of the
catalyst layer.

P5. A key requirement for improving the cold start is optimal mate-
rial and structural design of cells and stacks. For example, opti-
mized ionomer content in catalyst layers, proper membrane
thickness, and lower heat capacity materials can contribute to
performance. Optimization of the start mode and load control,
combined with the assisted heating method, may result in fur-
ther improvements. Although using the assisted cold-start
methods could be more effective, their feasibility and reliability
need to be considered, especially when applied to compact
products like fuel cell vehicles (FCVs).

PFuture cold start modeling studies should include and place
emphasis on the supercooling phenomenon and water transport/
phase-change in multi-layer porous media. Meanwhile, it is impera-
tive to utilize more sophisticated experimental methods, such as
real-time water and ice visualization and cryogenic microscopy, to
validate models and theories; these further research directions will
lead the field towards ultimate solutions to cold-start issues.
