This paper reviews current understanding of the manner in which non-premixed jet flames respond to
flow disturbances, and compares these characteristics to premixed flames. Disturbances in flow veloc-
ity excite wrinkles on non-premixed flame sheets and perturbations in heat release. These disturbances
convect axially along the flame at the local flow velocity and decay in amplitude. Sufficiently large dis-
turbance amplitudes cause opposing sides of the flame to merge and pinch off, leading to multiply con-
nected flame sheets. The space-time characteristics of flame wrinkles on premixed and non-premixed
flame sheets are quite similar, as they are dominated by flow disturbances moving the flame around,
convection of the wrinkles downstream, and dissipation of wrinkles. In contrast, the heat release dynam-
ics are quite different, as heat release oscillations in premixed flames are nearly uniformly distributed
along the flame, whereas in non-premixed flames they are concentrated near the burner outlet where
mixture fraction gradients are highest. In addition, flame area fluctuations are the dominant mechanism
leading to heat release oscillations in constant burning velocity premixed flames, while mass burning
rate oscillations dominate non-premixed flames. The flame transfer function, i.e., the normalized ratio
of heat release and flow oscillations, is of O(1) at low frequencies and transitions to a 1/ St behavior
at high frequencies, for both premixed and non-premixed flames, where St denotes the flame Strouhal
number, physically representing the ratio of the convective and the forcing time-scale. While the mech-
anisms dominating heat release oscillations are quite different for premixed and non-premixed flames,
these comparable asymptotic tendencies are actually the result of the same effects; namely, that the heat
release is proportional to the instantaneous mass flux of reactants in the quasi-steady, low Strouhal num-
ber case, and phase cancellation associated with convecting regions of oscillatory heat release leads to
the 1/ St behavior in the St (cid:3) 1 regime. Non-premixed flames have an additional 1 /
St transfer function
character at an intermediate range of Strouhal numbers, due to the sharply varying axial dependence of
mean heat release near the burner exit.

1. Introduction

This  paper  reviews  current  understanding  of  the  response  of
non-premixed  flames  to  harmonic  flow  perturbations.  This  work
is motivated by the problem of combustion instabilities and com-
bustion noise, where narrowband acoustic oscillations associated
with acoustic modes of a combustor, couple with and excite heat
release  oscillations  [1] .  Further,  reacting  flows  are  often  globally
hydrodynamically  unstable,  and  exhibit  intrinsic  oscillations  as-
sociated  with  natural  hydrodynamic  instabilities  associated  with
shear  (e.g.,  Kelvin-Helmholtz  instability),  density  gradients  (e.g.,
Rayleigh-Taylor  instabilities)  or  thermo-diffusive  instabilities  [1] .
Fig.  1  shows  images  of  the  forced  response  of  a  mixing  layer,
clearly denoting the rollup of the shear layer.

The feedback loop during combustion instabilities is depicted
schematically  in  Fig.  2 .  They  have  been  encountered  during  the
development and operation of various propulsion devices, power
generation  equipment,  heating  systems,  and  industrial  furnaces,
and are problematic because of the large amplitude pressure and
velocity oscillations they produce. Having amplitudes that in some
cases, specifically rocket applications, exceed several thousand psi ,
these oscillations can result in thrust oscillations, severe vibrations
that interfere with control-system operation, enhanced heat trans-
fer and thermal stresses to combustor walls, oscillatory mechanical
loads that result in component fatigue, and flame blowoff or flash-
back [3] . Each of these issues may result in degraded system per-
formance, unsatisfied product specifications, or premature compo-
nent/system wear leading to costly shutdown or even catastrophic
failure. Thus, improved understanding of combustion instabilities
is  helpful  for  developing  efficient,  safe,  and  reliable  combustion
systems.

This paper reviews the physics and understanding behind the
dynamics, both in position and heat release, of non-premixed, mo-
mentum dominated jet flames responding to fluctuations in flow
velocity. A great deal of literature on the linear and nonlinear re-
sponse of premixed flames to flow disturbances and the combus-
tion  instability  characteristics  of  lean,  premixed  combustors  has
been generated over the last decade [4–11] . Several review papers
on  premixed  flame  dynamics  have  appeared  recently  [5,  12–14] ,
including experimental investigations of various nozzle and com-
bustor  configurations  [9,  15–18] ,  numerical  simulations  with  de-
tailed diffusion, chemistry and turbulence [19–21] , and modeling
effort s using the G -equation for fuel-air ratio, velocity, and pres-
sure fluctuations [9, 11, 16, 18, 22–26] . As a result of this work,
the controlling physics governing the forced response of laminar,
premixed  flames  is  quite  well  understood  and  capabilities  have
been developed to predict the space-time dynamics of the flame
position and heat release [5, 27] . Furthermore, while some funda-
mental questions remain in highly turbulent flames regarding the
spatio-temporal nature of narrowband and broadband disturbances
and  their  interaction  with  the  flame,  exciting  progress  has  been
made in obtaining similar predictive capabilities in turbulent flows
as well [26, 28–30] .

In  contrast,  the  behavior  of  non-premixed  flames  respond-
ing  to  flow  disturbances,  both  in  terms  of  the  space-time  reac-
tion  sheet  dynamics,  as  well  as  the  temporally  varying  heat  re-
lease,  both  local  and  spatially  integrated,  is  much  less  well  un-

derstood.  Nonetheless,  there  has  been  a  recent  increase  in  re-
search  addressing  this  topic,  both  from  a  modeling  and  experi-
mental  viewpoint.  This  collective  intellectual  advancement  moti-
vated the present review, whose objective is to synthesize these
results  and  identify  areas  that  need  further  attention  for  future
work.

This  review  will  specifically  focus  on  the  forced  dynamics  of
gaseous  non-premixed  flames,  and  does  not  address  the  phe-
nomenon  of  inherent  non-premixed  flame  instabilities.  As  such,
we briefly summarize these intrinsic instabilities of both isolated
flame sheets, as well as that on non-premixed jet flames in Table 1 ,
and  show  experimental  examples  in  Fig.  3 .  Following  Matalon
[31]  and  Lieuwen  [1] ,  non-premixed  flames  exhibit  intrinsic  in-
stabilities, manifested as stationary or time varying cellular flame
structures,  or  even  bulk  flame  oscillations.  In  premixed  flames,
both fluid mechanics and the coupling of the flame and flow by
gas expansion play important roles in intrinsic instability. In con-
trast, intrinsic instabilities of non-premixed flames are controlled
by  thermal-diffusive  effects.  In  other  words,  gas  expansion  pro-
cesses quantitatively influence stability boundaries, but do not in-
troduce  new  instability  mechanisms.  Rather,  controlling  mecha-
nisms for intrinsic non-premixed flame instabilities arise from dif-
ferential  diffusion  of  mass  and  heat,  leading  to  regions  of  ex-
cess or deficient enthalpy. Instability mechanisms are closely tied
to  the  fact  that  non-unity  Lewis  number  or  mass  diffusivity  ra-
tios lead to non-similar temperature and fuel/oxidizer concentra-
tion  fields.  For  similar  reasons,  heat  loss  leads  to  intrinsic  in-
stabilities by causing non-similarity in thermal and concentration
profiles.

In addition, non-premixed jet flames, used in many industrial
hardware  components,  also  exhibit  intrinsic  instabilities  [34] .  In
the buoyancy dominated regime where the Froude number, F r =
U 2
f ) ,  is  not  too  high,  these  jet  flames  are  globally  unsta-
0 / (g R
ble  and  exhibit  narrowband  oscillations,  resulting  from  periodic
vortical structures traveling along the flame, manifested as flame
flicker at low frequency [35, 36] . This global instability disappears
at  small  Froude  numbers,  or  when  the  flame  becomes  momen-
tum dominated at large Froude numbers [37] . Additional studies
have investigated instability (oscillatory) onset and mitigation char-
acteristics, with dependence upon Damköhler and Lewis numbers
[31, 38, 39] .

Having briefly considered intrinsic instabilities, we next return
to externally forced flames, which are the focus of this review. Ex-
ternal excitation of non-premixed flames, such as by acoustic forc-
ing, has also been studied extensively, often with the motivation of
enhancing mixing and/or decreasing pollutant emissions, for rea-
sons discussed below. When subjected to external excitation, nom-
inally unstable (lower Froude number) flames exhibit a variety of
response features that depend upon the frequency and magnitude
of the excitation. For example, Chen et al. studied an acoustically
excited non-premixed flame [40] , showing oscillations in both the
fuel jet flow and flame sheet position, both of which were depen-
dent upon the forcing frequency and amplitude. They and others
[41-43] also showed nonlinear behavior, such as the presence of
the  sum  and  difference  in  frequencies  of  the  buoyant  instability
and external forcing frequencies, subharmonics and harmonics of
the excitation frequency, and frequency locking – i.e., the disap-

pearance of oscillations associated with the natural buoyant insta-
bility at sufficient excitation amplitudes. Williams et al. [44] ex-
plored this lock-in behavior, showing that forcing the fuel stream
at a frequency close to the natural buoyant instability frequency
was accompanied by the presence of large vortices on the air side
of the flame, leading to large amplitude oscillations of the overall
flame response at the forcing frequency. They also observed that a
related lock-in phenomenon could happen at the first subharmonic
of the forcing frequency, when the forcing frequency was close to
twice the natural instability frequency. Juniper and co-workers [45,
46]  conducted  a  detailed  study  on  the  lock-in  phenomenon  and
quasiperiodic evolution of acoustically forced jet diffusion flames.
They identified the critical amplitudes at which lock-in occur for
a range of forcing frequencies around the natural instability fre-
quency.

As a result of the strong effect of forcing on the ambient/co-
flowing air and its entrainment with the fuel jet, a number of stud-
ies  have  also  noted  significant  influences  on  soot  and  NOx  pro-
duction  from  the  flame  [47–59]  – sensitivities  which  are  much
stronger in non-premixed flames than in premixed flames. For ex-
ample,  Saito  et  al.  [47]  showed  that  soot  can  be  suppressed  in

The specific focus for this review paper is forced, non-premixed
jet  flames;  particularly,  the  flame  response  and  heat  release  dy-
namics. This review will not consider the combustor system dy-
namics (e.g., thermo-acoustic stability of combustor systems with
non-premixed flames) where non-premixed flames are present, but
note that an analytical and experimental literature exists on this
topic, as well as an extensive wealth of industry experience in this
area [74–77] .

The review is organized as follows. Section 2 starts by inves-
tigating  the  governing  features  and  properties  of  field  and  iso-
surface  dynamics.  The  mixture  fraction  governing  equation,  i.e.
Z -equation,  is  introduced  and  its  features  are  compared  with
those of the premixed flame G -equation. Section 3 discusses the
space-time dynamics of harmonically forced non-premixed flames
through  a  series  of  model  problems  with  increasing  complexity.
Section 4 presents a parallel discussion to Section 3 , focusing on
the heat release dynamics of these flames, including the low and
high St asymptotic trends and transfer function characteristics. Fi-
nally, Section 5 summarizes key findings and highlights areas of
needed future work.

2. Evolution of fields and iso-surface dynamics

While  combustion  always  occurs  over  a  distributed  volumet-
ric region, in many applications of interest its thickness is much
smaller than other hydrodynamic and acoustic length scales, and
so  it  can  be  treated  as  a  surface,  enabling  the  flame  dynamics
problem to be decoupled from that of its complex internal chem-
ical  kinetics.  Flamelet  models  constitute  one  of  the  most  com-
mon approaches for analyzing laminar and turbulent flames [97] .

acoustically excited non-premixed flames, with reductions of up to
50% in a laminar flame, and 90% for a turbulent flame.

In  addition,  several  studies  on  forced  counter-flow  diffusion
flames  have  analyzed  the  unsteady  flame  structure  and  flame
response  [60-62] .  Finally,  other  forced  flame  studies  have  fo-
cused on the flame’s space-time position dynamics due to veloc-
ity  and  equivalence  ratio  perturbations.  The  interaction  between
the acoustic field and the flame produces a spatially varying, os-
cillatory velocity component that is normal to the flame, causing
wrinkling, as well as oscillatory reaction and heat release rates [50,
63] . Further, there are several experimental and numerical studies
that examine the flow characteristics, flame dynamics, and mixing
mechanisms of acoustically modulated jet diffusion flames [52, 56,
64–73] .

Within  the  flamelet  approximation,  reactions  are  confined  to  a
layer  that  is  much  thinner  than  other  flow  length  scales,  which
may  be  substantially  contorted  and  stretched  by  turbulent  flow
disturbances. For premixed systems, the flamelet surface separates
unburnt  reactants  from  burnt  products,  while  for  non-premixed
systems  it  separates  fuel  and  oxidizer–rich  species.  In  the  latter
case, the flamelet occurs at the location where fuel and oxidizer
diffuse into the flame sheet at a rate given by, and equivalently
coexist at, their stoichiometric ratio.

This  section  discusses  the  dynamics  and  evolution  of  fields
and isosurfaces, from both a general mathematical standpoint, and
specifically for combustion related systems, and will closely follow
the treatment of Pope [80] . Defining a general scalar field as (cid:5), a
surface can be defined implicitly, through an equation of the form
(cid:22)
(cid:5)(X, t ) = (cid:5)
x , t ), where the evolution of each
respective entire surface is given by ∂ (cid:5)/ ∂ t or ∂ X/ ∂ t . Additionally,
the  evolution  equation  for  the  position  of  a  surface  is  given  by

tions, and the stretch factor [80] . The local geometry of surfaces is
described by the spatio-temporal surface element properties, con-
sisting of position, surface normal direction, principal curvatures,
and fractional area increase.

We can define three types of surfaces, namely - material sur-
faces, propagating surfaces, and constant-property surfaces. A ma-
terial surface (e.g. surface of passive tracer particles) is a passive
(cid:22)
interface  between  two  fluids  that  is  advected  by  the  flow,
u .  A
propagating surface (e.g. premixed flame) is a surface which prop-
agates normal to itself at a given velocity relative to the fluid. This
relative propagation velocity, w , is referred to as the displacement
speed, s
d , for premixed flamelets. A constant-property surface (e.g.
non-premixed flame) is a surface where some given property, (cid:5),
is constant. Non-premixed flame sheets occur along the constant
property surface where the mixture fraction, Z , has its stoichiomet-
ric value, Z = Z st .

Following  Pope  [80] ,  a  helpful  way  to  compare  and  contrast
these three types of surfaces is to recast the surface dynamics of
one surface type into the other, as shown in Table 2 . For exam-
ple, a constant property surface is defined as an iso (cid:5) surface, but
can alternatively be considered as a propagating surface with front
velocity relative to the flow given by  w = −( D (cid:5)/ Dt )/| ∇(cid:5)|.

For  both  a  material  surface  or  propagating  surface  with  con-
stant w , the evolution of any surface element is fully described for
a given velocity field and initial condition, and thus each surface
element evolves independently. However, the temporal evolution
of any surface element of a constant property surface is controlled
by the entire property field at each instant [80] . This has important
implications for the solution methods, since rather than consider-
ing evolution equations for a constant-property surface, an alterna-
tive approach is to deduce the surface properties from the property
field and its evolution [80] .

Consider a surface that is initially (1) “regular”, defined as hav-
ing  finite  curvature  everywhere  with  no-self  intersections,  criti-
cal  points,  or  cusps  [98] ,  and  (2)  simply-connected,  defined  as
having  no  fully  penetrating  holes  passing  through  it.  A  material
and constant-property surface remains regular during its evolution,
while  a  propagating  surface  can  develop  singularities,  i.e.  values
of infinite local curvature, and self-intersections [80] . For premixed
flames, this manifests itself as the formation of cusps, shown in
Fig. 4 – i.e. discontinuities in flame slope for constant w ( s
d ) flames
[4] .  As  will  be  seen  later,  external  forcing  complicates  (yet  still
follows) this behavior, producing multi-connected, i.e. segregated,
material surfaces and constant-property surfaces; a feature known
as  flame  clipping  for  non-premixed  flames,  which  occurs  under
certain critical conditions.

In  addition  to  the  local  properties  discussed,  the  evolution
equations  for  global  properties  of  level  surfaces  can  also  be  ex-
pressed [100] . This is of particular interest for combustion systems,
as total heat release and surface area are significant dynamical pa-
rameters of interest. The nature of the resulting equation to be es-
tablished will be kinematic, expressing the time rate of change of
global variables in terms of the progression velocity and geometric
parameters of the level surface. A global variable can be defined
as:

2.1. Field equations for premixed and non-premixed flames

Virtually all analytical work on non-premixed flame dynamics
has utilized the Shvab-Zeldovich mixture fraction formulation, due
to  its  analytical  tractability  in  the  absence  of  source  terms,  and
we shall follow this framework in this section. The mixture frac-
tion is defined as the mass ratio of material at each spatial loca-
(cid:22)
x , t) . Thus, Z
tion having its origin in the fuel stream, i.e., Z = Z (
takes values of zero and unity in the pure oxidizer and pure fuel
streams,  respectively,  and  is  given  for  a  simplified  three-species
system (consisting of fuel and oxidizer reacting to form a single
product), by:

Z = Y F +

Y Pr
( φ ox + 1)

(3)

where  φox  is  the  stoichiometric  oxidizer-to-fuel  ratio.  A  founda-
tion for the analytical work, the governing equation for the mix-
ture fraction has no source term if all species have equal diffusivity
coefficients, D , and is given by:
ρ D Z
Dt

− ∇ · ( ρD ∇ Z ) = 0

(4)

To solve this equation, the density must be related to the mix-
ture fraction. The simplest approach to proceed is to assume an
isodensity field, although certainly an oversimplification for com-
bustion applications. However, rather than assuming constant den-
sity, the less restrictive assumption of constant ρD can be utilized
(although  it  actually  varies  as  T  1/2  for  perfect  gases).  The  final
modified form of the mixture fraction equation, to be referred to

throughout this work as the Z -equation, is given by:
∂ Z
∂t

u · ∇ Z = D ∇ 2

(cid:22)

(5)

Consistent  with  Table  2 ,  the  flame  lies  on  the  locus  of
points, defining the flame sheet, given by the parametric equation
Z ( (cid:2) x , t ) = Z st . Typical representative Z st values are shown in Table 3 .
For premixed combustion the mixture fraction is uniform ev-
erywhere, assuming equi-diffusive species, and thus a similar con-
servation equation would provide no new information. Rather, the
G -equation is used for premixed flames in the reaction sheet limit
[5, 101, 102] , given by:
∂G
∂t

+  (cid:2) u · ∇ G  =  s

d |∇ G |

(6)

The flame lies on the locus of points, defining the flame sheet,
given by the parametric equation G ( (cid:2) x , t) = 0 . Both of these flame
front kinematic equations relate the motion of the flame front with
various flow/flame parameters implicitly, meaning the flamelet is
treated as a gas dynamic discontinuity in three-dimensional space
described by a specific isosurface. Simple schematics of the two
fields are shown in Fig. 5 .

It is helpful to compare the dynamics and governing features
of the Z -equation, given by Eq. (5) for non-premixed flames, with
the G -equation, given by Eq. (6) for premixed flames. The two ex-
pressions have the same convection operator on the left-hand side
which illustrates the importance of flow perturbations in the direc-
tion normal to the flame sheet in moving the flame sheet around.
However, the right-hand sides of these two expressions are differ-
ent; the premixed flame expression has the normal flame propa-
d | ∇G |, while the non-premixed flame expression
gation operator, s
has a diffusion operator, D ∇ 2
Z . This difference is significant and
reflects,  among  other  things,  the  fact  that  non-premixed  flames

do not propagate. Moreover, this propagation term makes the pre-
mixed flame dynamics equation nonlinear, while the non-premixed
(cid:22)
flame dynamics equation is linear (assuming
u and D are not func-
tions of Z ).

Another significant, yet subtle, difference is that the G -equation
is physically meaningful and valid only at the flame itself where
G ( (cid:2) x , t) = 0  (i.e.,  although  it  can  be  solved  away  from  the  flame,
the resulting G values have no physical significance [103] ). In con-
trast, the Z -equation describes the physical values of the mixture
fraction field everywhere . This point was alluded to earlier as well
for  constant  property  surfaces,  whose  dynamics  are  determined
by the instantaneous property field, rather than simply the veloc-
ity at the surface. Thus, the entire mixture fraction field must be
solved in the non-premixed problem and the Z ( (cid:2) x , t) = Z st  surface
extracted from the resulting solution field (which generally can-
not be expressed explicitly). Consequently, developing explicit so-
lutions for the non-premixed flame problem is not as straightfor-
ward as for the premixed problem. This observation has important
consequences for both solution approaches of these problems, as
well as the Z ( (cid:2) x , t) = Z st  flame sheet dynamics that are discussed
next.

Consider  next  the  case  where  the  flame  position  is  a  single
valued  function  of  some  coordinate.  For  example,  in  the  two-
dimensional case, the instantaneous position of the reaction sheet
is  given  by  y = ξ ( x,  t ),  shown  in  Fig.  6  for  representative  two-
dimensional premixed and non-premixed systems.

A useful transformation of the G -equation can be done by ex-
pressing Eq. (6) in terms of the flame position, ξ , through use of
the substitution G ( x, y, t ) = y − ξ ( x, t ). Although the resulting equa-
tion for the flame position becomes less general (being only valid
for a flame whose position is single-valued), it enables an explicit
governing  equation  for  the  flame  position  dynamics.  With  these
explicit  expressions  dynamical  quantities,  such  as  flame  surface
area fluctuations and flame curvature, can be obtained and inves-
tigated. Implementing this transform yields the following explicit
expression for the premixed flame position:

This discussion reflects important underlying physics of the two
flames. Consider a premixed and non-premixed flame embedded
in a velocity field given by (cid:2) u (x, y, z, t) , where the velocity field at
the flame sheet is given by (cid:2) u ( x, ξ ( x, z, t) , z, t ) = (cid:2) u u . The pr emixed
flame dynamics are only a function of (cid:2) u u ; this implies that for a
given (cid:2) u u , its space-time dynamics are the same for a variety of dif-
ferent velocity fields. In contrast, the space-time dynamics of the
non-premixed reaction sheet are a function of the entire velocity
field, (cid:2) u (x, y, z, t) , not just its value at the reaction sheet.

2.2. Description of model problems

Note that the substitution for G arbitrarily assigns values to the
G field away from the flame itself, namely that G varies linearly
with coordinate y away from the flame. Since the G field is com-
pletely arbitrary away from the flame this is allowable, however,
we cannot make an analogous substitution for the non-premixed

In this review, we shall present multiple model problems, with
increasing levels of complexity, in order to understand and isolate
the effects of different physics. These model problems are summa-
rized in Table 4 and will be detailed further in the section where
they are first introduced. The key differences between these model
problems is their inclusion of axial diffusion, as well as the trans-
verse  profiles  of  the  steady  state  mixture  fraction  at  the  burner
0 ( x = 0). The various steady inflow profiles utilized, de-
exit, i.e. Z
noted as f 0 ( y ) = Z

0 ( x = 0, y ), are shown in Fig. 7 .

3. Space-Time dynamics of the reaction sheet

This section examines the basic dynamical characteristics of a
non-premixed  flame  responding  to  harmonic  flow  perturbations.
We focus on the flame position in this section, and the integrated
heat  release  in  Section  4 .  This  section  is  organized  by  first  pre-
senting a basic model problem – the response of a non-premixed
flame to bulk, harmonic forcing. This analysis utilizes a variety of
simplifying assumptions in order to allow for analytically tractable
explicit  expressions  for  the  flame  position.  While  additional  ef-
fects like non-isothermal heat release and spatial temperature gra-
dients are neglected in this model problem, it enables us to de-
scribe some key physics which will be seen in computations and
experiments presented later that include these neglected effects.

3.1. Two-dimensional bulk axial forcing - Model Problem A

This section presents the results of a model problem to illus-
trate key physics that influence the spatiotemporal flame dynam-
ics. It closely follows the analysis from a suite of analytical studies
which have also considered the response of non-premixed flames
[87-93] . This work builds from the significant theoretical literature
on the unforced problem, such as the Burke-Schumann flame [49,
81, 104] .

As discussed in Section 2.1 , the Z -equation is utilized for this
formulation, with accompanying key assumptions of infinitely fast
chemistry,  wherein  the  flame  sheet  collapses  to  the Z st  surface,
equal  species  diffusivities,  constant  diffusion  coefficients,  speci-
fied  disturbance  fields,  and  small  perturbation  amplitudes  (see
Miklav ˇci ˇc  [94]  for  recent  generalization  of  this  work  to  include
finite  amplitudes).  As  such,  the  space-time  dynamics  of  a  non-
premixed  flame  can  be  described  by  the  mixture  fraction  field
using the Z -equation, Eq. (5) . The steady and fluctuating velocity
fields are imposed, thus decoupling the momentum equation from
the energy and species equations; this, however, implicitly assumes
an isothermal field.

Consider first a two-dimensional flame as depicted in Fig. 8 , in
a uniform axial flow field whose value in the absence of forcing
0 . At the inlet, i.e. x = 0, fuel and oxidizer flow into
is given by U
the domain as indicated in the figure, leading to the following step
inflow conditions:

(cid:9)
Z (x = 0 , y ) =

1  for  0 ≤ | y |  < R
f
0  for  R

f ≤ | y |  < R w

(8)

Enforcing this boundary condition enables an analytic solution
of the problem. In reality, however, there is transverse diffusion of
fuel just downstream of the inlet followed by axial diffusion of fuel

into the oxidizer port and vice versa, so that the solution must ac-
tually be solved over a larger upstream domain that includes the
fuel/oxidizer supply systems [95] ; this effect is captured and inves-
tigated in Model Problem C in Section 3.3 . As such, the boundary
condition  in  Eq.  (8)  implicitly  neglects  axial  diffusion  at  x = 0,  a
point which will be returned to in Section 3.3 . Assuming symme-
try at y = 0, no penetration through the walls at y = R w , and requir-
ing finite mixture fraction values throughout makes this boundary
value problem fully defined.

included or neglected, respectively (see Table 4 ); this will be elab-
orated on in Section 3.3 . Similarly, the dynamical equation for the
fluctuating mixture fraction field can be obtained from Eq. (5) and
written in the frequency domain (indicated with an overhat ( (cid:2) ) )
as:

Representative solutions are shown in Fig. 9 . The reaction sheet
is defined by the locus of points where Z ( x, y = ξ ( x, t ), t ) = Z st . Note,
the flame position, ξ ( x,t ), is implicitly contained in this expression.
Expanding this implicit equation for the fluctuating flame in terms
of Z and ξ ( x,t ), to first order, results in:
Z 0 (x, y = ξ0 (x ) + ξ1 ,n (x, t)) + Z 1 (x, y = ξ0 (x ) + ξ1 ,n (x, t) , t) = Z st
(18)

while  subsequently  expanding  this  equation  in  a  Taylor-series
yields:
Z 0 ( x, y = ξ0 ( x ) ) + ξ1 ,n ( x ) | ∇ Z 0 ( x, y = ξ0 ( x ) ) |

(cid:19)
+ Z 1 ( x, y = ξ0 ( x ) , t ) + O

Grouping the leading order terms results in the following im-

(19)

plicit equation for the steady flame position:
Z 0 (x, y = ξ0 (x )) = Z st

(20)

while the first order terms lead to the following explicit expression
for fluctuating flame position:

ξ1 ,n (x, t) = − Z 1 (x, y = ξ0 (x ) , t)
| ∇ Z 0 (x, y = ξ0 (x )) |

(21)

The perturbation in flame position can be measured radially or
normally to the mean flame surface in the direction of the oxi-
dizer, as shown in Fig. 9 . Generally, throughout this work, the nor-
mal displacement, i.e. ξ
1, n , is utilized for quantifying flame motion
due to the substantial change in the angle of the reaction sheet
with axial location (in contrast, if flame motion is measured as ra-
dial displacement, its value at the flame tip becomes ambiguous,
potentially taking infinite values).

An implicit expression for the flame sheet position, ξ

0 ( x ), can

3.2. Model problem results and experimental data - Discussion

This  section  discusses  the  key  physics embodied in  the  solu-
tions  derived  in  Section  3.1 ,  as  well  as  comparison  of  these  re-
sults  with  measurements.  Due  to  the  similarities  in  the  expres-
sion for the premixed and non-premixed flame, the equations are
discussed comparatively. Note first that both expressions are mul-
tiplied by an amplitude term of the form, ( εU
0 /2 π f ) × sin θ . This
1 ,n | / 2 π f ; i.e., the magnitude of the velocity fluctu-
is equal to | u
ations  normal  to  the  flame,  divided  by  the  frequency.  Thus,  the
flame sheet fluctuations act as a low pass filter and the sin θ term
simply converts the axial velocity fluctuation into the component
normal  to  the  flame  sheet.  Likewise  a  cos θ term  appears  if  the
flame is transversely forced [93] . Note that the particle displace-
1 | at a
ment associated with a velocity fluctuation of magnitude | u
1 | / 2 π f , showing that this low pass
frequency of f is given by | u
filter characteristic is simply a manifestation of the reduced parti-
cle displacement for a given magnitude velocity fluctuation with
increasing  frequency.  Referring  back  to  the  formulating  assump-
tions of Eq. (5) in Section 2.1 , note that differential diffusion effects
would alter the time averaged flame shape, which implicitly influ-
ences its response through the local flame angle and flame length.
It is not clear whether it introduces additional explicit effects on
the flame response to disturbances [106] .

Both expressions also contain a term of the form, 1 − e i 2 π f x /U
0 ;
the first term which describes spatially invariant bulk fluctuations,
arises  from  the  homogeneous  boundary  condition  (i.e.,  no  flame
position fluctuation at x = 0 which is implicitly imposed by Eq. (8) ),
while  the  second  describes  downstream  convection  of  wrinkles
whose axial speed is equivalent to the axial mean flow. The pri-
mary  difference  in  the  premixed  and  non-premixed  solutions  is
contained  within  this  waveform  term,  and  reflects  the  influence
of premixed flame propagation on wrinkle convection speeds. The
non-premixed flame does not propagate, and wrinkles convect ax-
0 . In contrast, wrinkles
ially downstream at the bulk flow speed, U
on the premixed flame convect in the axial direction at the speed
0 /cos 2 θ , which is the vector superposition of the axial flow ve-
U
locity and the axial projection of a vector pointing normal to the
flame (into the reactants) with a magnitude equal to the burning
velocity, s

d , as is depicted in Fig. 10 .

In  both  cases,  local  maxima  and  minima  arise  through  this
1 − e i 2 π f x/ U
0  waveform term, 1  due to interference between wrin-
kles generated at the x = 0 boundary and disturbances excited lo-
cally.
1 − e i 2 π f x/ U 0 = 2 sin ( π f x/ U 0 ) e i ( π f x/ U 0 −π / 2 )

(27)

For both premixed and non-premixed flames, wrinkles are gen-
erated  at  the  boundary  because  of  flame  attachment.  For  the
premixed  flame,  this  is  invoked  directly  through  the  attachment
boundary condition i.e., ξ
1, n ( x = 0, t ) = 0. In the non-premixed case,
wrinkles are generated through the assumption of constant mix-
1 ( x = 0, t ) = 0. This assump-
ture fraction at the burner outlet, i.e., Z
tion will be relaxed in Model Problem C.

We next present several illustrative solutions of the space-time
dynamics for the flame position. Note that the solution is a func-
tion of the four dimensionless parameters St
f / R w , Pe , and Z st .

Eq. (24) . The temporal evolution of the flame position is plotted in
Fig. 11 at two representative Strouhal numbers. Note the bulk axial
pulsing of the flame at lower Strouhal numbers, and the presence
of multiple spatial wrinkles within the flame length at higher val-
ues. The unforced flame is indicated by the dashed lines.

Mohammed et al. [50] have reported measurements and com-
putations  of  a  forced  CH
4 -air  diffusion  flame,  which  are  repro-
duced in Fig. 12 (left). In this experiment, only the fuel flow rate
was perturbed, as opposed to both fuel and air flow oscillations
in these calculations. However, it is still useful to compare results,
using conditions that approximately simulate those from the ex-
periment. Fig. 12 (right) shows calculations of the unsteady flame
position at several instants over a forcing cycle for similar condi-
tions. Similar bulk axial pulsing of the flame is evident in the mea-
surements.

An  alternative  way  to  visualize  these  results  is  through  the
magnitude and phase of ξ
1, n , illustrated in Fig. 13 . The nodes and
local maxima and minima referred to above are clearly evident in
the figure. The phase rolls off linearly with axial distance, again re-
flecting the convection process described by the interference wave-
form term in Eq. (27) , and jumps 180 ° across the nodes.

These  results  can  be  qualitatively  compared  with  the  experi-
mental results of Magina et al. [2] of an axially forced jet flame,
where both the fuel and oxidizer were forced. Representative re-
sults showing the measured, instantaneous spatial dependence of
ξ ( x,t ) at different time instances over a forcing period are shown in
Fig. 14 . Notice the clear downstream axial convection of the flame
wrinkle crests with time, a result predicted by the waveform por-
tion of the above equations. Also shown is an x - t diagram, show-
ing the temporal position of the wrinkle crests, also demonstrating
their downstream convection.

Flame wrinkle convection can also be directly inferred from the
phase of  ˆ ξ (x, f = f
f ) . Note that a wrinkle convecting axially at a
constant speed, U c , leads to a linear phase-axial location depen-
dence, with a slope given by:

In real flames with temperature gradients, complex shear flows,
and convecting vortical disturbances, it can be anticipated that the
evolution of flame wrinkles will be more complex than predicted
by the bulk forcing model given by Eq. (25) . Nonetheless, the re-
sults from the model problem provide useful interpretative insight

This behavior is suggestive of an interference phenomenon, consis-
tent with the model predictions. Similar interference results have
been observed for axially forced premixed flame systems [108] . The

phase rolls off nearly linearly with axial distance, for the reasons
discussed earlier in the context of Fig. 14 .

The results from the model problem cannot be directly com-
pared with experimental data because the assumed mean and un-
steady velocity fields differ from the actual values. However, direct
comparisons can be made by extracting the actual velocity fields
from measurements and solving Eqs. (9) and (10) computationally.
This was done by Magina et al. [2] and a sample result is shown in
Fig. 16 . Note similar features as described above and the reasonable
correspondence between the measured and predicted flame posi-
tion fluctuations. The primary differences occur in the near-base
region and are discussed in detail by Magina et al. [2] . In another
study, the fully nonlinear problem including axial diffusion effects
was numerically investigated by Li et al. [109] . They analyzed the
effect of Pe on the flame base oscillation and the distribution of

Returning  to  the  model  problem  presented,  it  is  of  interest
to  discuss  the  speed  of  the  non-premixed  flame  sheet  with  re-
spect  to  the  flow,  referred  to  as  w  in  Table  2 .  For  a  premixed
flame, this speed is simply the displacement speed, s
d  ( x,t ). Rec-
ognizing that the non-premixed flamelet does not propagate, yet
is  also  not  a  passive  scalar  that  moves  with  the  flow  where
w = 0,  the  speed  w  can  be  obtained  from  the  expression  in
Table 2 ,  w = −( D Z / Dt ) /| ∇Z |. This can be made evident by recasting
Eq. (5) in the following form:

premixed flames, s
d is strictly positive and may be a constant. Also,
note how the fluctuating burning speed amplitude looks similar in
shape to the flame wrinkle amplitude plot, having the same inter-
ference node patterns.

3.3. Axial Diffusion effects – model problems B and C

The theoretical analysis in Section 3.1 neglected axial diffusion
in order to demonstrate the key physics of flame wrinkle excita-
tion and convection, and the resulting constructive and destructive
interference effects this introduced. Of course, this and all other
physics were implicitly included in the experimental results. This

section analyzes axial diffusion (or equivalently, finite Peclet num-
ber effects) in order to explicitly demonstrate how they influence
the results.

We  start  with  Model  Problem  B  in  Table  4 ,  due  to  analyti-
cal tractability. Recall, Eqs. (11) and (14) provide solutions to the
mixture fraction field for the axially forced problem (other forcing
configurations can be found in Magina et al. [93] ), subject to the
step  inlet  condition,  given  by  Eq.  (8) ,  and  the  flame  attachment
1 ( x = 0, y, t ) = 0. The corresponding solu-
boundary condition, i.e. Z
tion for ξ
1, n ( x, t ) can be written generally, utilizing Eq. (21) and
defining St ω = 2 π St , as:

Insight  into  wave  propagation,  dissipation,  and  dispersion  ef-

these expressions around the Pe → ∞ limit in inverse powers of Pe .
For example, the ( β

where the waveform term is parameterized by a convection speed,
U c ,  axial  dissipation  rate,  ζ ,  and  dispersion  term,  γ ,  defined  in
Table  5 .  Additionally, I ( θ ( x ))  is  a  forcing  configuration  parameter
taking a value of sin θ 0 ( x ) and ± cos θ 0 ( x ) for the axial and trans-
verse forced cases, respectively [93] .

Consider the various terms in Eq. (36) . Similar to Eqs. (25) and
(26) , the expression is led by a group of terms which describe the
wave magnitude and harmonic time dependence, [ ε/( iSt ω )] I ( θ ( x ))
exp ( − i ωt ),  showing  the  familiar  low-pass  filter  characteristic  of
flame  wrinkle  amplitude.  The  wave  magnitude  also  has  an  ax-
ial dependence whose form depends upon whether the flame is
forced axially or transversely. This shows the controlling nature of
velocity fluctuations normal to the flame sheet, and how the top
and bottom flame branches are in-phase, i.e. mirror images of each
other, for axial forcing, and are out-of-phase for transverse forcing.
Finally,  the  non-premixed  steady  state  flame  angle  is  a  function
of axial coordinate, while for premixed flames with a comparable
0 , I ( θ ( x )) is not.

We next consider the general wave propagation term, contained
in  the  expression  1 − exp ( iωx/ U c ) exp ( −ζ x/ R
ω ωx/ U c ) .
Consistent  with  the  discussion  in  Section  3.2 ,  the  leading  unity
term derives from the particular solution of the equation, and lacks
spatial  dependence  because  of  the  nature  of  the  assumed  bulk
forcing. The second term describes a decaying, dispersive travel-
ing wave generated at the boundary, x = 0, resulting from the as-
sumption of flame attachment, i.e., ξ
1, n ( x = 0, t ) = 0, or fixed mix-
1 ( x = 0, y, t ) = 0, for the pre-
ture fraction at the burner outlet, Z
mixed and non-premixed cases, respectively.

f ) exp ( iγ St 2

The leading order expansion of this expression, 1 − exp ( i ωx / U c ),
was  previously  presented  and  discussed  in  Sections  3.1  and  3.2 .
It  demonstrates  how  flame  wrinkles  propagate  without  dissipa-
tion  and  non-dispersively  in  the  Pe → ∞  or σ C → 0  limits.  In  this
limit,  the  major  difference  between  the  space-time  dynamics  of
non-premixed and premixed flame dynamics comes from the U c
parameter  defined  in  Table  5 .  In  both  cases,  local  maxima  and
minima in flame wrinkle amplitude arise through interference be-
tween the two terms, revealed in Eq. (27) .

Consider  next  O(1/ Pe )  or  O( σ C )  terms  which,  as  shown  in
Table 5 , cause wrinkles to decay exponentially with downstream
distance. This causes the interference effect discussed above to be-
come  imperfect,  an  effect  that  increases  quadratically  with  St ω .
The mechanism for wave dissipation for the two flame types are
entirely different – for premixed flames, it is due to the depen-
dence of the flame speed on flame surface curvature, which causes
positive  Markstein  length  flames  to  be  thermo-diffusively  stable.
For non-premixed flames, it is due to the progressive smoothing by
diffusion of the spatial variations in the Z field with downstream
distance. Lastly, O(1/ Pe 2 ) and O( σ C 2 ) effects introduce dispersion,
as shown explicitly in Table 5 – i.e., a frequency dependent wave
propagation speed.

Illustrative  solutions  using  Eq.  (36)  are  presented  for  the  in-
stantaneous non-premixed flame position at several time instances
over a forcing cycle in Fig. 18 , as well as the amplitude and phase
of  the  wrinkles  in  Fig.  19 ,  for  constant  values  of  St
Lf  .  The  gen-
eration  and  downstream  propagation  of  flame  wrinkles  can  be
observed, with a larger number of flame wrinkles being present
within the flame length for increasing frequencies. Again, the spa-

(bottom) for PeSt ω = 4 π and Z st = 0.3. Note the x -axis is rescaled by Pe (Reprinted
from Magina et al. [93] with permission of Elsevier).

tial variation in the amplitude comes from the I ( θ ( x )) term, specif-
ically sin θ
0 ( x ) for this axially forced case depicted, as well as the
spatial interference effect in Eq. (36) . The local maxima and min-
ima  referred  to  above  are  clearly  evident  in  the  figures  for  the
weakly dissipative solutions. The phase rolls off linearly with ax-
ial distance, reflecting the convection process described, and jumps
180 ° across the nodes. Note the smoothing of the wrinkles that oc-
curs in the mid and far field with decreasing Pe , due to wave dis-
sipation discussed in the context of Eq. (34) . This effect reduces
the overall peak-to-crest wrinkle amplitudes, as well as eliminat-
ing previously spatially stationary nodes, represented by the liftoff
from the vertical axis. This leads to a complete loss of the spatial
interference pattern for the Pe = 5 case relative to the Pe → ∞ case.
In addition, the phase does not roll off linearly in the axial direc-
tion, and the discontinuous phase jumps are smoothed. Lastly, the
steady state flame position becomes modified by axial diffusion.
Both the flame tip location (i.e. overall flame length), and the lo-
cation of maximum width move downstream, as can be seen from
Fig. 19 by the movement of the flame angle forced node, an effect
which was shown to impact the dynamics in Section 3.1 .

It is important to note that although these solutions include ax-
ial diffusion in the governing equation, they utilize the step inlet
boundary condition at x = 0, given by Eq. (8) . As noted earlier, this
boundary condition itself implicitly neglects axial diffusion. It also
creates a non-physical infinite transverse gradient in mixture frac-
tion at the fuel port lip, a singularity that dominates certain so-
lution characteristics such as the flame attachment and asymptotic
heat release characteristics (to be discussed in Section 4 ). In reality,
axial diffusion smoothes out this step boundary condition, as fuel

additional boundary condition effects can be treated with Model
Problem C, first considered by Magina et al. [95] , by considering a
modified domain with an extended inlet, as shown in Fig. 20 . Note

curves starting from zero at x = 0 in Fig. 13 and Fig. 19 . However,
coupled axial and transverse diffusion effects move this flame at-

ports (depending on the specific Z st  and Pe values); i.e., into the
x < 0 domain. This effect can be observed in the experimental | ξ

In  other  words,  to  properly  and  consistently  include  and  ac-
count  for  axial  diffusion  effects,  and  to  properly  describe  the
fuel/oxidizer gradients near the burner lip, we must include the
x < 0 fuel and oxidizer ports, since fuel can diffuse back into the
oxidizer port and vice versa, altering the inlet profile. In addition,
no diffusion through the side walls and fuel port walls implies the
following additional conditions:

Numerical solutions of this equation show that inclusion of ax-
ial diffusion, in addition to direct effects on the wrinkle dynam-
ics discussed above, influences the instantaneous flame attachment
point, i.e. the location where the reaction sheet intersects with the
fuel port wall. In the Pe → ∞ limit, this location is stationary and
always positioned at the fuel port lip, x = 0 and y = R
f , valid for all

Relatedly,  the  instantaneous  attachment  point  moves  over  a
forcing  period.  Fig.  21  shows  a  sample  result  for  the  magnitude
and phase plots of the instantaneous flame attachment point trans-
fer  function  for  a  range  of  St  values.  The  transfer  function,  de-
fined  as  ( x
0 )  quantifies  the  input-output  relation
between forcing and flame attachment point motion. Notice how
the magnitude of this axial motion depends upon the forcing fre-
quency. Consistent with the discussion in Section 3.2 , this is due to
the low-pass filter characteristic of the flame position, as the time
derivative of the flame position is related to the local flow velocity
through Eq. (5) . In addition, there is increased motion at low Pe
values, due to the increased contribution of axial diffusion. The Z st
value also has an influence upon the transfer functions, an effect
which is coupled to Pe [95] . For example, very low and high Z st
values have larger transfer function amplitudes than intermediate
values.

3.4. Multi-dimensional forcing effects

The previous sections have covered the idealistic case of two di-
mensional non-premixed flames excited by unidirectional, spatially
uniform,  fluctuations  in  flow  velocity.  However,  real  combustion
systems  are  not  this  simple,  being  inherently  three-dimensional,
and  are  often  times  exposed  to  multi-dimensional  disturbances
(e.g., helical vortices or transverse acoustic waves) and have multi-
dimensional  time  averaged  flow  fields  (e.g.,  swirling  jet  flows),
effects  which  introduce  rich  flame  dynamics,  such  as  azimuthal
wrinkle  convection.  This  section  presents  the  results  for  round
jets (note the prior sections considered two-dimensional jets) sub-
jected to these disturbances, closely following Magina et al. [111] .

stantaneous  position  of  the  three-dimensional  reaction  sheet,  in

We can identify several canonical forcing configurations, char-
acterized by the forcing velocity field sets shown in Table 6 . Bulk
axial forcing of the round jet is conceptually similar to the two-
dimensional case discussed in Sections 3.1 thru 3.3, the key differ-
ence being mean flame shape; i.e. θ
0 ( x ), which will be referred to
as ψ

0 ( x ) for the cylindrical configuration (see Fig. 22 ).

The next case shown in Table 6 is bulk transverse forcing, which
is substantially different from the two-dimensional case discussed
in Section 3.3 . Significantly, the angle of the transverse forcing with
respect to the sheet ranges from normal incidence (as in the two-
dimensional case) to grazing (where it causes no wrinkle excita-
tion). If there is no swirl, this causes the largest wrinkling to oc-
cur on the opposing sides of the flame that are subjected to the
normally incident velocity disturbance, and no wrinkling at all to
occur on the opposing sides with grazing incidence. However, in
the presence of swirl azimuthal transport of these wrinkles causes
flame wrinkling to occur at all azimuthal locations [111] . The com-
bined action of both axial and azimuthal convection of flame wrin-
kles leads to interference in both axial and azimuthal directions.
The last case shown in Table 6 is helical forcing, for which there
is no two-dimensional analogue. For this reason, this problem is
considered in more detail in the next section.

3.4.1. Convecting helical disturbance solutions

Round jets, whether swirling or non-swirling, often exhibit or-
ganized  vortical  disturbances  that  wind  helically  around  the  jet

is well known that important interference effects control the axial
flame wrinkling character, as vortices disturbing the flame, and the
flame wrinkles excited by these convecting vortices, do not gener-
ally travel at the same speed.

The analytical solution of Eq. (41) is considerably simplified by
neglecting azimuthal diffusion, a good approximation for realistic
σ and St values [111] , without losing any key dynamical features.

This  solution  has  similar  low-pass  filter  and  mean  flame  an-
gle axial dependence as the previous bulk forced solutions, how-
ever, the leading wrinkle magnitude and waveform terms are more
complicated due to the convective nature of the disturbance and
the parameter χ ; thus significantly, azimuthal interference changes
the  axial  amplitude  and  phase  dependence.  To  leading  order  in
Pe , the denominator shows how the complex interaction of swirl
strength,  helical  mode,  and  disturbance  phase  speed  act  to  al-
ter the flame wrinkle magnitude, an interaction which produces
a maximum in local spatial response for χ = 0, or corresponding
mode number given by:
m s σ = 1 − 1 / k c

(47)

Similar  criterion  holds  for  premixed  flames  [112] ,  and  corre-
sponds  to  the  case  where  the  azimuthal  forcing  exactly  mirrors
the wrinkle convection, so that no destructive interference occurs;
rather  they  constructively  superpose  to  cause  the  magnitude  of
flame wrinkling to grow monotonically with downstream distance
[111] . Significantly for this axisymmetric mean flow, helical modes
in the flow excite a corresponding helical motion in the flame re-
sponse.

In  the  presence  of  swirl,  there  are  no  azimuthal  locations  at
which the flame is unwrinkled, due to simultaneous azimuthal and
axial propagation of wrinkles by the flow. Swirl acts to azimuthally
transport wrinkles around the flame to other θ angles, contributing
to the imperfect nature of the spatial interference at a given angle,
thus eliminating previously existing spatial nodes due to azimuthal
convection.

The  two  new  additional  parameters  which  emerge  as  signifi-
cant controllers of flame wrinkle dynamics are k c  and σ m ; note
that σ and m always appear together in this form, indicating that
swirl  only  influences  the  flame  response  through  helical  modes.
Both terms alter the wrinkle interference pattern as well as the
flames relative sensitivity to various co- and counter-rotating heli-
cal modes, an effect which can be more easily observed by rewrit-
ing Eq. (46) as, χ = σ ( m s − m ). To leading order in Pe , mode num-
bers closer to the value m s produce a lower value of χ and hence
a higher flame motion response amplitude, and vice versa.

An additional important point is that to leading order in Pe , the
wrinkle magnitude is independent of the sign of χ , whereas this
is important for the phase of the flame response. At a given az-
imuthal location, the axial phase varies linearly with downstream
distance with a slope given by π St ( χ − 2/ k c ). Thus, for the delin-
eating case of χ = 2/ k c , the flame response fluctuations at all axial
locations, for a given azimuthal location, are in phase with each
other. When χ > 2/ k c , the phase roll off is positive, indicating an
apparent negative phase speed (at a fixed azimuthal location), an
aliasing previously discussed for helically forced, premixed flames
[112] . In reality, the flame wrinkles are always convecting down-
stream, but if imaged via their projection through a plane (such as
with a laser sheet), the helical flame wrinkle slicing through the
plane can provide the impression of the wrinkle moving backward
for certain parameter combinations [113] .

These points are slightly modified if order 1/ Pe terms are in-
cluded, due to the additional term in the denominator of the mag-
nitude term, which acts to alter the wrinkle magnitude and phase
roll off. In addition, the O(1/ Pe ) waveform term (1 – σ m ) 2 acts to
alter the dissipation term non-monotonically, leading to minimum
wrinkle  dissipation  when σ m = 1.  These  features  can  be  seen  in
Fig. 24 which shows illustrative solutions of the axial dependence
of flame wrinkle magnitude and phase for various values of χ for
a near-bulk ( k c = 20) and convecting disturbance ( k c = 3.33) case.
Notice, that results are shown for both Model Problem A ( Pe → ∞ )
and Model Problem B ( Pe > > 1) from Table 4 .

These results can be compared to those obtained for axisym-
metric swirling premixed flames under similar forcing conditions

using the results of Acharya et al. [112, 113] . These expressions are
almost identical in form to those for the non-premixed case, with
a few subtle differences common to the discussion in Section 3.2 .
First, the premixed flame angle term is independent of the axial
coordinate, owing to the flat nature of the steady state flame sheet,
whereas for the non-premixed case this term is a complex func-
tion of x, Pe , Z st , and s . Second, the wrinkle convection parameter
for the premixed case has an additional cos 2 ψ , due to the mech-
anism of premixed flame normal propagation.

3.4.2. Large amplitude forcing and pocket formation

As was discussed in Section 2 , at large disturbance amplitudes,
non-premixed flame sheets can become multiply connected. This
effect  has  been  referred  to  as  “clipping”,  where  the  upper  por-
tion of the flame becomes detached from the main body and con-
vects  downstream,  much  like  a  burning  droplet  [32,  114] .  Pre-
mixed flames similarly become multi-connected, an effect greatly
enhanced  by  the  front  propagation.  Dworkin  et  al.  [63]  showed
how large amplitude modulation can lead to pinch-off of the top
portion of the flame into a pocket. The considerable corrugation of
the flame front causes it to self-intersect and split, and the result-
ing  disconnected  region  collapses  while  convecting  downstream,
even  while  the  remainder  of  the  surface  enlarges  near  the  base
[90] . As this phenomenon occurs with large particle displacement,
it has been found in experimental and computational studies to
only occur below a certain frequency of excitation and above a crit-
ical amplitude for that frequency.

Experimental  [114]  and  computational  [32]  studies  of  soot
volume  fraction  in  flickering  CH
4 /air  non-premixed  flames  have
shown that for conditions in which the tip of the flame is clipped,
soot  production  is  significantly  greater  than  similar  unclipped
flames,  as  well  as  being  4–5x  greater  than  that  measured  for
steady  flames.  This  effect  can  be  explained  by  the  maximum
downstream location obtained by a portion of clipped flame ex-
ceeding that for a similar conditioned, i.e. forcing frequency, un-
clipped flame, resulting in considerably longer soot growth times.
Fig. 3 shows two examples of flames with large amplitude oscil-
lations where the flame becomes multi-connected at the tip, one
due to a natural instability and the other due to external forcing.

4. Heat release analysis

Having introduced the local space-time wrinkling characteris-
tics of the flame, this section discusses the heat release dynamics.
The subsequent discussion considers the local heat release, q ( x, t ),
followed  by  a  treatment  of  the  spatially  integrated  heat  release,
 ̇ Q (t) .

cepts, the terms in Eq. (48) take the form ( x,t ), while equivalently
these expressions would be written as ( x, θ , t ) for a jet flame. This
mass burning rate term is controlled by quite different processes
for premixed and non-premixed flames [92] . For premixed flames,

burning rate is a very strong function of the axial coordinate for
non-premixed flames, having a singularity at the flame base, i.e.
x = 0, when axial diffusion is neglected. In contrast, for a premixed
flame with no stretch sensitivity, the burning rate is constant (even
if there were stretch sensitivity, that correction would only be im-
portant at the flame tip).

These results hint at a point which will be emphasized repeat-
edly  – the  high  transverse  gradients  near  the  nozzle  exit  cause
substantial variations in mass burning rate distribution and, more-
over, cause the burner exit profile details to dominate the mean
and fluctuating heat release characteristics, both locally and spa-
tially  integrated.  Given  these  points,  and  the  consequent  limita-
tions  of  the  prescribed  step  inflow  boundary  condition  ( Eq.  (8)
utilized in Model Problems A and B) in describing these near x = 0
details, the results in the remainder of this section will focus on
solutions  extracted  from  Model  Problem  C,  the  extended  inflow
configuration  (see  Fig.  20 )  with  axial  diffusion,  closely  following
the treatment by Magina et al. [95] . The alternate model problems
will be returned to while examining various asymptotic character-
istics in Section 4.2 .

Also plotted for reference is the axial distribution for a constant
burning velocity premixed flame, indicated by “PM Flame” in the
legend. This abbreviation will be used throughout to denote the
values for a corresponding premixed flame.

For the steady state distribution, the Pe → ∞ limiting case has
a singularity at the inlet due to the discontinuity in mixture frac-
tion at the burner exit, that can be shown analytically 4  to scale
as   ̇ m (cid:5)(cid:5)
F  ∼ x −1 / 2 , as also shown in Fig. 26 [106] . With finite Pe val-
ues , the inlet profile is smoothed and the peak value at x = 0 is
reduced.  In  addition,  the  heat  release  contribution  from  the  tip
(where only axial diffusion contributes) increases with decreasing
Pe value. Comparing the premixed and non-premixed flame curves
shows that half of the average heat release occurs in roughly the
first 15–20% of the non-premixed flame, while it occurs at the 50%
flame midpoint for the premixed flame. This result clearly shows
the  need  for  particular  care  in  accounting  for  inflow  conditions
f < < 1 region for non-premixed flame prob-
that influence the x / R
lems.

Fig. 27 shows the corresponding unsteady heat release distribu-
tion,  ˆ q 1 (x ) , for various Pe and St values. The cumulative heat re-
lease distribution is plotted in Fig. 28 with two different normal-

The  remainder  of  this  section  will  consider  the  axial  distri-
bution  of  the  local  heat  release.  We  will  assume  that  the  reac-
tant  composition  is  fixed,  such  that h R  does  not  vary,  resulting
in  the  local  heat  release  rate  being  directly  proportional  to  the
mass burning rate. The solutions to the model problems detailed
in Section 3 can then be utilized, along with Eq. (50) to calculate
the heat release and other useful metrics.

A  key  result  that  controls  many  of  the  non-premixed  heat
release  characteristics,  as  well  as  provides  significant  differences
with premixed flames, is that the local heat release distribution is
extremely non-uniform – for large Pe value flames, the majority of
the heat release occurs near x = 0 [95] . This can be seen by taking
the solutions for Model Problem A, detailed in Section 3.1 (specifi-
cally Eqs. (13) and (17) 3 ), and writing the solution for ∂ Z / ∂ n from
Eq. (51) (neglecting the axial diffusion term, ∂ Z / ∂ x ):

f , 0 = 1 corresponds to the flame transfer function’s value (dis-
/ L
cussed in Section 4.2 ). The second normalization uses the spatially
f , 0 = 1
integrated  unsteady  heat  release,  so  that  its  value  at  x  /  L
goes to unity, thus allowing for visualization as to which parts of
the  flame  contribute  to  its  unsteady  heat  release.  Fig.  27  shows
that for Pe > > 1 and St < < 1, the largest values of local fluctuat-
ing heat release occur at both the flame base, due to the sharp in-
let gradient, and at the flame tip, due to the pulsing flame length.
However, neither of these regions contributions to the cumulative
heat release are dominant, as shown in Fig. 28 . An additional sub-
tlety, as discussed in Section 3.3 , for Model Problem C the flame
attachment point actually occurs at x < 0, resulting to some heat
release in that region.

For Pe > > 1 and St ∼ O(1) or > > 1, the local heat release at the
tip diminishes, and the largest local values occur at the flame base.
Moreover, the cumulative distributions show that the majority of
the unsteady heat release occurs at the flame base – a fact which
enables the development of simple asymptotic expressions for the
St > > 1 heat release, which is detailed in Section 4.2.1 [95] . The
same St trends hold for lower finite Pe values, yet the base and
tip (for low St values), contributions are reduced and the middle
length of flame has a larger contribution due to axial diffusion.

4.2. Global heat release analysis

Oscillations  in  heat  release  generate  acoustic  waves  via  un-
steady  gas  expansion,  which  are  manifested  as  broadband  noise
and  discrete  tones,  for  unconfined  and  confined  flames,  respec-
tively  [4] .  If  the  combustion  region  of  interest  is  much  smaller
than  an  acoustic  wavelength,  then  disturbances  originating  from
different points in the flame arrive at the measurement location
with  negligible  phase  shift.  This  describes  a  “compact  flame” in
which the distribution of the heat release is unimportant; rather
the quantity of relevance is the total, spatially integrated value [4] .
This spatially integrated quantity is given by the following surface
integral over the reaction sheet:

It  is  useful  to  define  the  following  (flame)  transfer  function,
which quantifies the magnitude and phase sensitivity of the heat
release to flow disturbances:

F ( ω ) =

ˆ  ̇ Q
1 ( ω ) /  ̇ Q 0
(cid:22)
ˆ (cid:22)
u 1 /
u 0

(58)

ˆ (cid:22)
where
u  denotes  a  reference  forcing  velocity;  for  example,  for
axial  bulk  forcing  this  transfer  function  takes  the  form  F =
( ˆ  ̇ Q 1 /  ̇ Q 0 ) / ( ˆ u x, 1 / U 0 ) .  Alternate  definitions  can  be  utilized  for  the
other  various  heat  release  coupling  mechanisms,  such  as  pres-
sure or equivalence ratio oscillations, where this parameter phys-
ically  represents  an  input-output  relation  between  the  distur-
bance fluctuations and the resulting heat release fluctuations. Once
again  assuming  constant  composition  reactants,  as  was  done  in
Section 4.1 such that h R does not vary, the results in Eq. (58) can be
decomposed into contributions from mass burning rate and flame
area  fluctuations;  i.e., F = F
mbr + F wa .  This  can  be  done  by  lin-
earizing and expanding Eq. (48) as:

which  implicitly  defines  the  fluctuating  heat  release  as   ̇ Q 1 (t) =
mbr (t) +   ̇ Q wa (t) .
 ̇ Q

The first term in Eq. (59) represents the mean spatially inte-
grated heat release, similar to Eq. (55) . The second term defines
the mass burning rate term. For non-premixed flames, this con-
tributes to heat release oscillations due to the fluctuations in spa-
tial  gradients  of  the  mixture  fraction.  For  premixed  flames,  the
mass  burning  rate  fluctuations  are  linked  to  the  stretch  sensi-
tivity  of  the  burning  velocity  (or  due  to  oscillations  in  mixture
composition),  which  fluctuates  because  of  the  oscillatory  curva-
ture  of  the  wrinkled  front  [110] .  The  last  term  in  Eq.  (59)  is
a  fluctuating  area  term,  weighted  by  the  time  averaged  burning
rate.  As  discussed  above  (see  Fig.  25  and  Fig.  26 ),  a  major  dif-
ference between the heat release response of premixed and non-
premixed flames is that this weighting term is essentially a con-
stant  for  premixed  flames,  whereas  it  varies  strongly  for  non-
premixed flames. If the time averaged burning rate is constant (a
commonly  studied  case  for  premixed  flames),  then  this  term  is
given by:

There  are  significant  variations  in  time-averaged  heat  release
rate along the non-premixed flame (e.g., no heat release at the tip
in the absence of axial diffusion, see Fig. 26 ), thus the weighting
of flame area is a very significant effect influencing how area fluc-
tuations lead to heat release. Indeed, it is common in premixed
flame studies to directly equate heat release fluctuations to flame
area fluctuations [8, 9, 11, 113] . However, this is not the case in
non-premixed flames and is responsible for several critical differ-
ences in the heat release dynamics of these forced flames; even
while Section 3 showed significant similarities in the space-time
wrinkle dynamics of premixed and non-premixed flames, this sec-
tion will show that their heat release dynamics are fundamentally
different.

For  example,  the  characteristics  of  the  weighted,   ̇ Q wa (t) ,  and
un-weighted,   ̇ Q a (t) , area transfer functions are essentially the same
for premixed flames. In contrast, they are quite different for non-
premixed flames, as illustrated by reference to a quasi-steady ar-
gument  in  Fig.  29 .  The  first  plot  (on  the  left)  shows  the  non-
premixed  mean  flame  position  for  two  different  mean  flow  ve-
locities. As is expected, the higher velocity case produces a flame
with a larger total area. However, Fig. 25 and Fig. 26 showed that
for non-premixed flames, the near base-region is of greater impor-
tance, containing the dominant portion of the mean mass burning
rate. Significantly, restricting our attention to the near-base region
of the flame, i.e. the white region in Fig. 29 , it can be observed
that the resulting (weighted) area actually decreases with increas-
ing mean flow velocities. The second plot (on the right) shows how
for low forcing frequencies, the area contribution is in-phase with
the velocity forcing, while the weighted area contribution is 180 °
out of phase – in other words, in the low Strouhal number limit,
the non-premixed flame weighted and un-weighted area transfer
functions  differ  in  phase  by  180 ° and  have  appreciably  different
magnitudes.

4.2.1. Asymptotic transfer function characteristics

Before  presenting  computational  and  experimental  results  for
flame  transfer  functions,  it  is  useful  to  consider  various  asymp-
totic limits and the processes controlling these limits. The various
asymptotic limits for the four model problems listed in Table 4 ,
as well as the Strouhal number demarcating the various limiting
regimes, are summarized in Table 7 .

The singularity in mixture fraction gradient in Model Problem
A near x = 0 was shown to be of the form x −1/2 , and integrable –
for this reason, significant insight into the spatially integrated heat
release characteristics can be obtained from this simplest model
problem.  Utilizing  Eq.  (58)  and  the  results  from  Section  3.1 ,  the
transfer function can be written as:

Comparing the terms in this expression to Eq. (58) , there is an additional term,
∂Z 0 / dx sin ( θ 1 ), having equal and opposite magnitude in the mass burning rate and
weighted area terms, thus cancelling in the Q 1 expression shown, as demonstrated
by Magina et al . [93] Magina N, Acharya V, Sun T, Lieuwen T. Propagation, dissipa-

Lf < < 1.  This  value  of  unity
can be understood physically from the fact that in the quasi-steady
limit, the instantaneous heat release is proportional to the instan-
taneous mass flow rate of fuel and oxidizer into the combustion
domain, i.e. across the inlet plane; in other words, a 1% fluctua-
tion in velocity induces a 1% fluctuation in heat release [4] . For the
same reason, there is no unsteady heat release induced by trans-
verse bulk forcing, i.e. F = 0, however, this conclusion applies for all
Strouhal numbers. The justifications for these gain results apply for
the same reasons to premixed flames. The transfer function gain
need not converge to unity for Model Problems B, C, and D, be-
cause axial diffusion causes the convective and total mass flow rate
to differ. However, it asymptotes to unity in the limit of Pe > > 1 for
all the model problems.

A  common  unsteady  heat  release  model  used  in  larger  ther-
moacoustics  systems  dynamics  models  is  the  η- τ model  [115] ,
where the unsteady heat release is related to the velocity through
a gain, η, and time delay, τ , given by:
 ̇ Q 1 ( t ) /  ̇ Q 0 = ηu 1 (t − τ ) / U 0

(66)

or, equivalently written in terms of a transfer function as:
F = η exp [ iωτ ]

(67)
We can use the above result to determine these η- τ parameters
for non-premixed flames in the St << 1 limit. Inspecting Eq. (65) ,
the gain is unity, i.e. η= 1, and the time delay is given by:
(cid:14)

This time delay is equivalent to replacing the distributed flame

length. While the gain is straightforward, the time delay is a com-
plex function of parameters such as Pe and Z st , discussed in more
detail by Magina [106] . These parametric dependencies of τ cannot
be calculated analytically but must be extracted from the compu-
tations due to the implicit nature of the solution for mean flame
position, at which these integrand values are evaluated.

Fig. 30 plots calculations of τ /( L

0 ) as a function of Pe and
Z st  [95] .  The  corresponding  constant  burning  velocity,  premixed
flame value is also plotted for reference. The solid lines indicate
the numerical extended inlet results, i.e. Model Problem C, while
the dashed lines show the corresponding Pe → ∞ analytical results,
given by Eq. (68) , i.e. Model Problem A.

f ,0  /  U

Note  that  the  time  delay  value  (normalized  by  L

0 ),  for
example,  is  around  0.2  for  a  methane-air,  non-premixed system,
which  has  a Z st  value  of  0.055  (see  Table  3 ).  For  reference,  the
constant burning velocity two-dimensional bulk axially forced pre-
mixed flame result is τ /( L
0 ) ≈ 0.5 (assuming the flow veloc-
ity is much greater than the flame speed), showing that the non-
premixed flame time delay is about a factor of two smaller than a
premixed flame with the same length. This result directly follows
from the concentration of heat release near the burner outlet, and
the distributions shown in Fig. 26 .

f ,0 / U

Additionally, in the low St limit, the ratio of weighted area con-
tributions relative to mass burning rate contributions to the trans-
fer function gain is of order O(1/ Pe 2 ) [95] – i.e., mass burning rate
contributions dominate the unsteady heat release in Pe >> 1 flames.
This point will be returned to in the next section.

Having considered the St << 1 limit of F , we next consider the
large St limit. Recall, Section 4.1 (see Fig. 28 ) showed that the high
St limit, Eq. (63) was controlled by the features of g ( x , ξ
0 ) near
x = 0 [95] . This fact can be exploited to expand  Eq.  (64) around
x = 0 which, following Magina [106] , becomes:

g(x, ξ0 ) =

Substituting this expression into Eq. (63) leads to the following

large St result:

St >> 1  F ≈

−( 1 + i )
(cid:13)
S t L

f

(70)

This shows that the phase between the velocity and heat re-
lease  has  a  constant  value  of  45 ° and  that  the  gain  rolls  off as
1/( St 1/2 ). As the flame transfer function amplitude was shown to be
unity in the limit of low St values, the Strouhal number at which
this  first  transition  occurs,  denoted  St
1  in  Table  7 ,  from  O(1)  to
O( St −1/2 ), can be obtained via the intersection of these limits, as
1 = 1/8. As shown in the next section, the 1/( St 1/2 ) behavior of
St
the heat release transfer function is a much slower roll off than

the 1/ St roll off that occurs to leading order in premixed flames,
causing the heat release response of non-premixed flames to ex-
ceed  that  of  premixed  flames  at  high  Strouhal  numbers  for  this
problem.

Recall, however, that g ( x , ξ

0 ), given by Eqs. (64) and (69) , was
obtained  for  Model  Problem  A,  i.e.  solutions  in  the  Pe → ∞  limit
(no axial diffusion) utilizing the step inlet boundary, Eq. (8) . There
exists a third, even higher St asymptotic zone, that cannot be an-
alyzed without inclusion of more realistic species inflow profiles.

at  f  ( x
2 ),  and  generally  lead  to  a  1/ St  asymptotic  be-
havior. However, for Model Problems A and B the mass burning
rate has an integrable singularity at the x = 0 inlet boundary due
to the infinite transverse gradient in Z imposed by the step inlet
boundary condition, a singularity that ends up controlling the heat
release asymptotics, leading to the indicated 1/( St 1/2 ) behavior. In
other  words,  this  singularity  controls  this  asymptotic  trend  and
causes it to exhibit a 1/ St 1/2 rather than a 1/ St asymptotic behav-
ior. Note, how this is still valid for Model Problem B, where axial
diffusion effects were included in the governing equation, i.e. b = 1
in Eqs. (9) and (10) . When axial diffusion effects are included and
the inlet profile mixture fractions are not discontinuous, i.e., Model
Problems C or D (discussed next), this 1/( St 1/2 ) behavior persists for
a range of Strouhal numbers where the convective wrinkle wave-
0 / ω, is much longer than the thickness of the transition
length, U
zone of fuel/oxidizer profiles at x = 0. However, once the convective
wavelength becomes of the order of this layer, the standard 1/ St
behavior occurs, as expected for these oscillatory integrals. Thus,
the Strouhal number at which the 1/ St 1/2 to 1/ St transition occurs
is a function of the thickness of this layer, which in turn, is a func-
tion of Pe .

This point can be demonstrated explicitly through Model Prob-
lem D, which excludes axial diffusion from the governing equation,
but utilizes a finite thickness Z
0 inlet transition layer, parameter-
ized by δ [95] . In reality, the non-dimensional profile thickness pa-
rameter, δ,  simulates the  extent  to  which axial diffusion has  al-
tered the inlet boundary condition, and is proportional to the in-
verse of Pe . Fig. 31 demonstrates this point explicitly by showing
extracted profile thicknesses from Model Problem C, for various Pe
values, where δ is measured as the distance from 0.95 × f

which should make sense as the inlet profile, f

comes thinner, as Pe is increased, converging to a step function in
the Pe → ∞ limit. Thus, if we substitute in δ∼1/ Pe into Eq. (75) , this

4.2.2. Transfer function characteristics

Having  considered  the  asymptotic  tendencies  of, F ,  we  next
present computed and measured results. The majority of the cal-
culated results are investigated numerically, due to the implicit na-
ture of the flame location at which the values of the integral, i.e.
Eq. (57) , are evaluated at. Fig. 32 plots the computed amplitude
and phase of F as a function of St for various Pe values, for Model
Problem C, as well as the Pe → ∞ result, for Model Problem A. For
the amplitude, the most prominent difference between the results
which include and neglect axial diffusion are the asymptotic char-
acteristics discussed in Section 4.2.1 ; Model Problem A having a
two-zone structure, while Model Problem C results show a three-
zone asymptotic structure. The phase plot also shows some differ-
ences between the results, although they all appear qualitatively
similar.

The solutions for the premixed flame transfer functions are sim-
pler, as the unforced flame is flat in a uniform velocity field. Fol-

and λ is Euler’s constant, with numerical value λ (cid:3) 0.577216. Note
how the leading order St > > 1 term is O(1/ St 1/2 ), consistent with
Eq. (70) , while the next term is of O(1/ St ). Thus, while a 1/ St 1/2 be-
havior occurs for the step inlet function profiles, a smooth mixture
fraction at the base of the flame (resulting from finite Pe value ef-
fects) leads to the 1/ St asymptotic behavior that one would expect
of highly oscillatory integrals. For this model problem, we can de-
velop an explicit expression for the Strouhal number at which the
1/ St 1/2 to 1/ St transition occurs, denoted as St

Physically, this transition Strouhal number coincides with con-
ditions where the convective disturbance wavelength is on the or-
der of the axial extent required for fuel/oxidizer to diffuse across
the inlet transition layer.

As was stated previously, the profile thickness parameter, δ, is
proportional to the inverse of Pe under these conditions, a point

Typical solutions for the overall unsteady heat release, as well
as the contributions from flame area and mass burning rate, are
shown  in  Fig.  33  for  the  non-premixed  and  premixed  flame  for
Model Problem A. Both premixed and non-premixed transfer func-
tions  have  magnitudes  of  identically  unity  at  zero  St ,  consistent
with the η- τ discussion regarding Eq. (68) , indicating the direct
1:1 relation between the fluctuation in velocity and induced fluc-
tuation in heat release, and then roll off with increasing St , indi-
cating a progressively smaller induced heat release fluctuation [4] .
However, the dominant contributors to heat release are com-
pletely  different.  Starting  with  the  left  plot,  note  how  the  non-
premixed flame heat release fluctuations for St < < 1 are dominated
by mass burning rate fluctuations over the entire Strouhal number
range (the ratio of mass burning rate to area contributions from
the unsteady heat release being O( Pe 2 ) in the low St limit [106] ).
In contrast, premixed flames at low and O(1) Strouhal numbers are
dominated by area fluctuations, shown in the right plot. The mass
burning rate fluctuations are a much smaller effect and only exert
a comparable response as area fluctuations at high Strouhal num-
bers where S t p ∼ O( ˆ σ −1

c  ) [110].

Direct comparisons of the gain and phase response of the pre-
mixed and non-premixed flame results are shown in Fig. 34 . No-
tably,  these  results  show  that  non-premixed  flames  are  signifi-
cantly more sensitive to flow perturbations than premixed flames
> O(1), an important conclusion, and due to the fact that
when S t L
f
for St > O(1), non-premixed flames roll off initially as 1/ St 1/2 , while
premixed flames go as 1/ St , as discussed in Section 4.2.1 .

The corresponding phases of the premixed and non-premixed
flame transfer functions are also included in Fig. 34 . Both curves
start  at  zero  for  low  Strouhal  numbers,  indicating  that  low  fre-

quency flow modulation induces heat release fluctuations that are
in  phase.  The  curves  roll  off with  different  slopes  toward  nega-
tive  values  and  asymptote  to  −90 ° for  the  non-premixed  flame
and −45 ° for the stretch sensitive, premixed flame. This phase is
a manifestation of the delay in heat release relative to the forc-
ing, due to convection of disturbances along the front. Note also
the nearly constant phase (at −45 °) in the non-premixed flame in
the intermediate Strouhal number range discussed above. The un-
dulations in phase for the premixed flame correspond to ripples in
the gain, and reflect the influence of interference processes in con-
trolling the flame area. The differences in phase between the two
flames again reflects the different processes controlling unsteady
heat release.

Although limited in quantity, other researchers have measured
transfer  functions  of  a  forced  experimental  system  [33]  – a  key
difference from the above results being that the experiments are
for a round jet. Fig. 35 shows a measured flame transfer function
gain comparison (see Kim et al. for phase [33] ) with analytical re-

sults, specifically Eq. (63) for Model Problem A. The differing fuel
compositions alter the details of the gain and phase oscillations,
reflected as different Z st values in the analytical study, however the
trends remain comparable. The gain results are certainly consistent
with  the  predicted  O(1/ St 1/2 )  trends  from  expressions  above,  i.e.
Eq. (70) . It is not possible to directly compare the low St values; in
addition, for these experiments the flames were highly corrugated
and even multi-connected with high degrees of clipping. Note that
no transition to the predicted 1/ St is observed in these data; this is
likely due to the fact that this transition occurs at a Strouhal num-
ber that is larger than where data was acquired (our estimate of
St

2 using Eq. (76) and quoted flame lengths is St

2 = 190).

We  close  this  section  by  considering  bulk  transverse  forcing
of  the  flame.  Unlike  the  space-time  dynamics  conclusions  from
Section  3 ,  where  flame  wrinkling  was  fundamentally  the  same
with a subtle change in the forcing-flame front orthogonal direc-
tion, the heat release results are quite different. In this configura-
tion, in the Pe → ∞ limit, for all St values the area and mass burn-

tatively similar to that summarized above in the two-dimensional
analysis. For the transversely forced configuration, similarly to the
two-dimensional case, heat release oscillations cancel each other
on opposite sides of the flame, thus resulting in no unsteady heat
release. For helical disturbances, this same cancellation occurs for
all mode numbers except for the m = 0, axisymmetric mode. Thus,
as is the case for premixed flames, the m = 0 mode is the sole con-
tributor to the heat release oscillations, with k c  (see disturbance
form  in  Table  6 )  being  the  only  new  parameter  influencing  the
transfer functions [112] . Moreover,  the flame transfer function is
not explicitly a function of the swirl (although, implicitly the un-
forced flame position is). Thus, the final discussion of this section
presents analytical results for the response of a jet flame to a con-
vecting,  axisymmetric  disturbance.  Note  that  the  axial  bulk  case
corresponds to k c = ∞ .

Fig.  36  shows  heat  release  transfer  function  magnitude  and
phase results from the three-dimensional variant of Model Prob-
lem A for various values of k c , the normalized disturbance phase
speed. It shows that the gain starts at unity and rolls off, with the
details of the roll off varying with disturbance phase speed. The
modulation in gain and phase reflects the influence of interference
between phase cancellation/reinforcement of different regions on
the flame.

Recall from Section 3.4.1 , specifically Eq. (47) , that for a swirling
flow,  a  non-axisymmetric  mode,  m s ,  dominated  the  flame  wrin-
kle response amplitude [106] . This is significant given the fact that
only the axisymmetric mode, m = 0, contributes to the global spa-
tially integrated heat release fluctuations. Thus, different measures
of the flame response, such as local wrinkling, local heat release,
and global heat release, have very different sensitivities to swirl
and different azimuthal modes.

5. Concluding remarks

It  has  been  discussed  how  velocity  forcing  of  non-premixed
flames leads to the excitation of wrinkles that convect downstream
and lead to local and spatially integrated heat release fluctuations.
The amplitude of these wrinkles is proportional to the magnitude
of  flow  displacement  fluctuations  normal  to  the  flame  sheet.  As
these wrinkles are excited at every point along the flame with ve-
locity  fluctuations,  the  resultant  flame  wrinkle  amplitude  at  any
given  position  is  superposition  of  the  upstream  forcing  history,
convection velocity of the flame, and decay rate of a given wrinkle.
This  leads  to  constructive  and  destructive  interference  behavior,
causing  flame  wrinkling  amplitude  magnitudes  to  oscillate  with
downstream distance. Similarly, the convection of wrinkles by the
flow, causes the phase of flame wrinkles to roll off roughly linearly
with axial distance. While the resultant superposition of wrinkles
can become more analytically complex when the forcing is three-
dimensional (e.g., a helical vortex), and the flow is swirling (caus-
ing  wrinkles  to  convect  both  azimuthally  and  axially),  the  basic
physics remains the same. There are numerous analogies of these
flame wrinkle behavior characteristics to premixed flames, and this
review compares and contrasts these results throughout. The key
difference between the premixed and non-premixed flame is that
premixed flames propagate normal to themselves, which modifies
the convection speed of a flame wrinkle causing it to differ from
that of the local flow velocity, while non-premixed flames do not.
Once wrinkles are excited on the flame, they decay at a rate that
increases  quadratically  with  frequency.  In  non-premixed  flames,
this occurs because of diffusion smoothing out space-time varia-
tions in mixture fraction, while in premixed flames with positive
Markstein lengths, this occurs because of the dependence of the
flame speed on curvature.

Local heat release on the flame is directly proportional to the
local mass consumption rate of reactants. In non-premixed flames,

ing rate contributions from the two branches have the same mag-
nitude but are out of phase by 180 °, resulting in no unsteady heat
release for one-half of the flame [93, 96] . This result could be an-
ticipated, at least in the low Strouhal number limit, as transverse
forcing  causes  no  fluctuation  in  fuel  and  oxidizer  flow  rate  into
the domain. Since the heat release in the quasi-steady limit is di-
rectly proportional to the fuel flow rate into the domain, transverse
fluctuations consequently lead to no heat release oscillations. Sim-
ilar conclusions were developed for transversely forced premixed
flames by Acharya et al. [113] . Significantly, this point emphasizes
the  important  distinction  between  local  and  global  heat  release
fluctuations.  As  was  discussed  in  Section  4.1 ,  even  though  there
are no global heat release fluctuations, the local heat release by
each segment of flame is fluctuating, as is the instantaneous flame
position.

4.2.3. Round jet characteristics

This  section  presents  the  transfer  function  characteristics  of
round jets exposed to disturbances and compliments Section 3.4 ,
which identified several canonical forcing configurations, character-
ized by the forcing velocity field sets shown in Table 6 - bulk axial,
bulk transverse, and convecting helical disturbances. For bulk axial
fluctuations, the flame transfer function for the round jet is quali-

the  mass  consumption  rate  is  directly  proportional  to  gradients
in  mixture  fraction.  These  gradients  can  be  very  high  near  the
burner outlet, where previously separate fuel and oxidizer species
first meet, but smooth out with downstream distance. This causes
the local mass burning rate to vary substantially in non-premixed
flames in the axial directions, with the largest values encountered
in the near-burner outlet region. In contrast, the mass consump-
tion  rate  of  premixed  flames  is  proportional  to  the  flame  con-
sumption  speed  which,  except  in  highly  curved/strained  regions
of  the  flame,  is  essentially  constant.  As  such,  the  axial  distribu-
tion of heat release in a premixed flame can be much more uni-
form than a non-premixed flame. These factors, in turn, directly
influence the spatially integrated heat release, which is controlled
by  the  near-burner  outlet  region  in  non-premixed flames  and  is
more  uniform  in  premixed  flames.  In  the  low  Strouhal  number
regime,  this  causes  the  time  delay  between  a  velocity  perturba-
tion and the resultant heat release to be substantially shorter for
non-premixed  flames  than  premixed  flames.  Additionally,  at  low
Strouhal numbers, the heat release is directly proportional to mass
flow  rate of  reactants into the combustor  domain for  both non-
premixed and premixed flames, causing their gain values to both
have the same unity value. For the same reason, transverse forcing
causes local flame wrinkling and heat release fluctuations, but no
spatially integrated heat release fluctuations. The near discontinu-
ity in mixture fraction also dominates the high frequency response
of non-premixed flames, causing it to roll off as 1/ St 1/2 . This leads
to  a  much  slower  roll  off of  non-premixed  flame  gain  with  fre-
quency than premixed flames, which roll off as 1/ St . Only at much
higher Strouhal numbers, where the mixture fraction gradient be-
comes  of  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  the  convective  wave-
length, does the non-premixed gain roll off as 1/ St . These asymp-
totic  tendencies  of  the  non-premixed  flame,  as  such,  are  largely
controlled by the near burner exit region with high transverse gra-
dients, and thus, are expected to be quite sensitive to burner exit
details and finite chemistry effects (which would lead to extinc-
tion)).

We close this review with suggestions for needed future work.
Starting  with  modeling  efforts,  it  is  worth  highlighting  two  key
assumptions made in the model problems considered - constant
diffusivity and infinite chemistry. Understanding the dynamics of
forced  flames  with  relaxation  of  these  assumptions  will  be  very
interesting.  Previous  studies  have  found  that  finite  rate  effects
have little to no effect on the natural flickering dynamics of non-
premixed flames [116] , and it seems unlikely that they would influ-
ence the basic wrinkle dynamic characteristics presented here, i.e.

convection, dissipation, and dispersion. However, finite chemistry
will  thicken  the  flame,  introducing  additional  chemical  time  de-
lays and flame extinction near the burner outlet, where the largest
gradients in mixture fraction and heat release occurs. Pushing the
region of heat release downstream, where there is less spatial vari-
ation in heat release, would introduce significant differences to the
results shown here, such as potentially eliminating the 1/ St 1/2 re-
gion of the transfer function. Similarly, it will be very interesting to
determine what fundamental new characteristics appear with non-
equidiffusive species. Lastly, alternate flame configurations, such as
the unconfined jet and jet-in-crossflow, need further investigation,
being of extreme relevance and potentially having more simplified
analytical solution forms.

Experimentally, it is evident that there is a strong need for fur-
ther studies. There is no analogue in the forced non-premixed liter-
ature to the enormous number of studies that have been reported
in laminar and turbulent premixed flames, with a wide variety of
configurations. Such studies are clearly needed. Foundational lami-
nar studies are needed with different Damkohler numbers to pro-
vide benchmarking data on frequency effects, configuration effects,
and finite chemistry effects. Following such work, analysis of tur-
bulent non-premixed flames should be investigated – again over a
range of forcing, configuration, and kinetic parameters are needed,
but where turbulence intensities and length scales can be system-
atically varied.

Finally,  additional  fundamental  studies  of  partially  premixed
flames are needed – a number of studies in liquid-fueled aircraft
engines  have  been  performed  where  the  flame  exists  in  varying
degrees of premixedness, and further understanding of how to in-
terpret such data, and their relationship to perfectly non-premixed
and perfectly premixed results is needed.
