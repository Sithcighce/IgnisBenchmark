Dense gas-solid reacting flow involves multiphase flow, heat and mass transfer, and chemical reactions. The
computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) has emerged as a promising tool for inves-
tigating and optimizing dense gas-solid reacting systems at the particle scale. Despite the rapid advancement of
CFD-DEM and its successful application to various chemical engineering processes, there is still a lack of a
comprehensive review of the theory and applications of CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow.
This article aims to bridge this gap by providing a systematic review of recent progress in the development of
CFD-DEM models and their applications to dense gas-solid reacting systems. This article begins by providing a
comprehensive review of sub-models used to describe flow dynamics and thermochemical conversion in dense
gas-solid reacting systems. The numerical algorithms and implementations, ranging from flow to heat and mass
transfer, as well as speed-up methods, are examined in detail. The focus then shifts to the recent advancements of
CFD-DEM applications in chemical engineering processes related to dense gas-solid reacting systems. Specific
areas of interest include the thermochemical conversion of biomass and coal, blast furnace ironmaking, chemical
looping combustion, solid waste incineration, lime shaft kiln calcination, and more. Furthermore, the challenges
associated with effectively and efficiently modelling dense gas-solid reacting flow, particularly about the multi-
physics and multi-scale characteristics in both time and space, are thoroughly assessed. By addressing these
challenges, this review is expected to foster further progress in the field and enhance our understanding and
control of dense gas-solid reacting systems in various applications.

1. Introduction

Dense gas-solid reacting flow has gained wide application in various
chemical engineering processes, including fluidized bed gasification,
blast furnace ironmaking, chemical looping combustion, solid waste
incineration, and so on. In these systems, high particle concentration,
complex chemical reactions, and substantial heat and mass transfer
occur due to intense inter-particle and inter-phase interactions. There-
fore, it is essential to study and optimize these systems to enhance their
efficiency and performance [1]. Taking the fluidized bed gasification for
example (Fig. 1), at the microscale, biomass particles undergo drying,
pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion with topological and thermo-
chemical variations. At the mesoscale, the bubble evolution with rising,
growth, coalescence, and break-up processes significantly influences
gas-solid mixing and segregation and further affects gas product yields
at the macro scale. In the past decades, plenty of experimental efforts
have been made to study dense gas-solid reacting systems [2â5]. Several
advanced non-invasive and non-intrusive techniques are available for
measuring dense gas-solid systems. Positron emission particle tracking
(PEPT) is a widely used method that tracks radiolabeled particles in real
time, providing detailed data on particle movement, velocities, and
residence time [6]. X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) allows for
high-resolution 3D imaging of particle and bubble distributions,
particularly suited for static or quasi-static systems [7]. Gamma-ray
densitometry measures the overall particle and gas distribution by
capturing density variations. Other methods like particle image veloc-
imetry (PIV) focus on capturing particle velocities through optical
means [8], while electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is effective

for real-time monitoring of particle concentration in larger systems [9].
Each technique has its specific applications, depending on the resolution
and system scale needed. However, our current understanding of the
intricate hydrodynamics and thermochemical behaviour within such
complex systems remains limited. This is primarily due to the challenges
faced by experimental methods in accessing detailed in-furnace phe-
nomena. The harsh operating conditions (e.g., high temperature and
pressure, opaque nature of the apparatus and disturbances caused by
instruments), make it difficult to obtain comprehensive insights. As a
result, there is a need for alternative approaches to bridge this knowl-
edge gap and provide a deeper understanding of these complex
processes.

In addition to experimental methods, numerical simulation serves as
a powerful
for investigating dense gas-solid reacting flow.
Numerous numerical methods, based on varying resolutions, have been
proposed in this research domain [11] (Fig. 2). The gas phase can be

and
Lattice-Boltzmann equations. For a detailed analysis, direct numerical
simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) are utilized to capture
the intricate details of gas turbulence, while Reynolds-averaging
Navier-Stokes (RANS) is better suited for industrial applications due to
its computational efficiency. The solid phase can be considered either as
a continuum or as discrete dispersed particles within the Eulerian and
Lagrangian frameworks, respectively. In contrast to continuum methods
like the two-fluid model (TFM), the discrete element method (DEM)
shows inherent advantages in capturing the detailed physical-thermal
for
behaviour of
particle-level interactions and dynamics makes DEM an invaluable tool
for investigating complex systems involving granular materials or par-
ticulate flows [12]. In addition to the DEM, the coarse-grained method
(CGM) offers a computational advantage by reducing the number of
particles by lumping multiple real particles with identical properties,
such as velocity, temperature, and species, into a numerical parcel [13].
In the context of gas-solid interactions, two commonly used approaches
are
the particle-resolved method and empirical models. The
particle-resolved method involves directly calculating detailed infor-
mation at the gas-solid interface to capture mass, momentum, and en-
ergy exchanges. In contrast, empirical models rely on several sub-models
to describe drag force, heat and mass transfer, and chemical reactions

individual particles. This ability to account

[14,15].

Fig. 3 outlines the multi-scale numerical strategies for modelling
dense gas-solid reacting flow [12]. DNS-DEM is the most accurate
method in which the grid size is smaller enough than the particle
diameter to capture the detailed flow around each particle. This method
aims at micro-scale description but suffers from tremendous computa-
tional costs, thus it can only track a limited number of particles [16â18].
For example, DNS-DEM has been used to study the fluidization of 5000
and 9240 spherical particles in bubbling fluidized beds (BFB) [16,17].
This approach effectively captures all scales of motion within the flow
and shows better agreement
in time-averaged particle velocities
compared to coarse-grained methods. TFM is the coarsest method in
which the gas and solid phases are assumed as interpenetrating continua
with inter-particle collisions simplified. This method targets macro-scale
description but cannot obtain particle-scale information [19,20]. The
computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) of-
fers a balanced approach by providing a capacity to accurately track a
large number of particles [15,21]. This coupling method employs the
Eulerian framework to solve the gas phase within each computational
cell, and the Lagrangian framework to solve the solid phase. The
CFD-DEM framework is highly extensible, allowing the integration of
sub-models to describe multi-physics interactions, such as heat transfer,
chemical reactions, and additional forces (such as electrostatic force,
liquid bridge force, and van der Waals forces) [22,23]. This makes
CFD-DEM an effective tool for studying complex systems involving
gas-solid flows or granular materials.

With its high efficiency and accuracy, CFD-DEM has found applica-
tions in various chemical engineering processes, including the thermo-
chemical conversion of coal and biomass, blast furnace ironmaking,
chemical looping combustion, fluid catalytic cracking, incineration,
calcination, and more. In recent years, several CFD-DEM algorithms and
sub-models have been proposed and developed for specific scenarios.
There is a need for a com mprehensive review to address the knowledge
gap regarding the theoretical fundamentals and development roadmap
of CFD-DEM modelling for dense gas-solid reacting flow in emerging
applications. Previous studies have offered valuable insights into the
theories and applications of CFD-DEM for modelling particulate flows
[15,21,23â27]. Among these studies, several researchers emphasized
including the interaction forces
the modelling of particle motion,

between particles and the fluid in the system [15,21,24]. These studies
have also delved into the methodologies for coupling CFD and DEM, as
well as the development of drag correlation models with a strong
theoretical foundation. Additionally, recent studies have highlighted the
application of the CFD-DEM method in multi-scale simulations, ranging
from small-scale laboratory studies to large engineering systems [22,
26]. Notably, it has proven useful in predicting particle motion and fluid
flow in complex systems, offering insights into particle formation, en-
ergy conversion, and separation processes [23]. In recent years, there
has been significant progress in the development of DEM approaches to
model non-spherical particulate systems. A recent review paid attention
to coupling non-spherical DEM models with CFD for particle-fluid flow

[27]. This study examined four crucial aspects of the modelling process.
Firstly, the techniques used for representing non-spherical particles and
contact detection were discussed. Secondly, the models describing
inter-particle collision dynamics and fluid-particle forces were explored,
along with the corresponding theoretical developments. Thirdly, the
study looked at various CFD-DEM coupling methodologies, including
the averaged volume method and immersed boundary methods. Finally,
the applications of these theories were examined to model different
non-spherical particulate systems. In the realm of DEM-based simula-
tions, a recent review concentrated in the thermal models and heat
transfer mechanisms [25]. The study not only conducted a thorough
examination of the major models but also highlighted often overlooked

aspects, including boundary conditions and the distribution of particle
body temperatures. By analyzing these thermal models and heat transfer
mechanisms, as well as exploring commonly neglected factors, the re-
view aims to provide valuable insights and enhance the understanding
of DEM-based simulations in terms of thermal behaviour.

It is noted that the abovementioned reviews are only limited to dense
gas-solid flow cold systems or heat transfer systems. Although a recent
review has discussed the possibilities and limits of CFD-DEM simulations
in process engineering, the theoretical developments and applications
could be enhanced [23]. Thus, a state-of-the-art review of the CFD-DEM
modelling of dense gas-solid reacting systems is required. It should be
noted that the dilute gas-solid reacting flow such as pulverized coal
combustion and entrained biomass gasification is beyond the scope of
the current review. In addition, this review focuses on the unresolved
framework of CFD-DEM modelling for dense gas-solid reacting flow. The
resolved framework, known as âDNS-DEMâ or âparticle-resolved
CFD-DEM (PR-DNS)â, is not discussed here, as its prohibitively high
computational costs make it unsuitable for practical chemical engi-
neering applications in the present day.

The current review is organized as follows: Section 1 provides an
overview of the background on multi-scale numerical methods for
modelling dense gas-solid reacting systems. Section 2 gives mathemat-
ical models and theories of CFD-DEM. Specifically, the CFD-DEM
framework is given in Section 2.1 and the thermochemical sub-models
are presented in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. Section 2.4 gives the speed-up
methods. Section 3 shows the recent advances and applications of the
CFD-DEM regarding the thermochemical treatment of biomass and coal,
chemical looping combustion, fluid catalytic cracking, incineration,
calcination, and so on. The challenges and future trends of CFD-DEM
modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow are discussed in Section 4.
The conclusion is drawn in Section 5.

2. Mathematical models

The CFD-DEM framework, including governing equations for gas-
solid phases, contact model, shape characterization, drag model, and
mapping procedure, is first presented. Thermochemical sub-models
involving heat transfer and chemical reactions are presented subse-
quently. The speed-up methods for the CFD-DEM simulation are eluci-
dated finally.

The grid size is usually larger than the particle diameter, thus the gas-
solid interactions are denoted by interphase transfer laws, in which the
pointwise, Lagrangian particle information (e.g., velocity, force) is
transferred to the continuous, Eulerian fluid field via various statistical
weighting or interpolating schemes [28]. Under the Lagrangian frame-
work, particles are regarded as the dispersed phase, in which the

trajectory and force of each particle are calculated via the DEM [29].
The governing equations for a specific particle including translation,
rotation, energy conservation, and species conservation can be
expressed as follows:

The Lagrangian framework utilizes Newtonâs law of motion to
accurately describe the behaviour of particles. By explicitly integrating
the governing equations for the solid phase, crucial parameters can be
obtained, including acceleration, velocity, and position for each particle.
This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of particle dy-
namics and enables precise analysis of their motions within the system.
Gravity (mpg), pressure gradient force (fâp = Vp â¢ âPf ), contact force
(fc), and drag force (fd) are usually considered in modelling dense gas-
solid flow due to the small gas-to-particle density ratio (Ïf/Ïp = 1/
2500â1/1000) and a relatively low particle Reynolds number. In the
modelling of dense gas-solid reacting systems, it is common to focus
primarily on the fundamental interaction forces between particles, such
as gravity, drag, and collision forces. However, other complex interac-
tion forces, such as the Basset force, virtual mass force, Saffman force,
and Magnus force, as well as non-contact forces like capillary force, van
der Waals force, and electrostatic force, though significant in other ap-
plications, are often not considered in the simulation [30â32]. In most
CFD-DEM simulations of dense gas-solid reacting flow, gas turbulence is
either neglected or modelled using approaches such as LES [33,34] or a
modified k-Îµ turbulence model [35,36]. However, particle-turbulence
interactions are typically not considered, due to the following aspects:
(i) In CFD-DEM simulations, the mesh resolution in the CFD solver is
typically coarse and cannot fully capture gas turbulence at both
grid-scale and sub-grid scales. A modified k-Îµ turbulence model is
commonly employed to describe grid-scale gas turbulence. This strategy
has been widely adopted in CFD-DEM studies of chemical engineering
processes [35,37]. (ii) The particle sizes in these simulations are typi-
cally on the order of millimeters (~mm), with bed materials and solid
fuels having a density of ~103 kg/m3, which is significantly higher than
the gas density (~100 kg/m3). This large particle size and high
particle-to-gas density ratio (Ïp/Ïf ~ 103) result in high particle inertia.
Consequently, the dispersion and motion of particles are primarily
governed by large-scale gas-phase forces, such as drag force, pressure
gradient force, and contact forces [38,39]. As a result, the influence of
sub-scale turbulence on particles is negligible and can be safely dis-
regarded in simulations of dense gas-solid reacting flow under most
conditions [15,40,41].
If particle-turbulence interaction must be
considered in CFD-DEM simulations under certain extreme conditions, a
velocity-filtered density function (VFDF) transport equation can be
introduced to account for sub-grid scale (SGS) turbulence in particle
motion. Combined with LES for the gas phase, the LES-VFDF model has
been demonstrated to accurately capture SGS effects in CFD-DEM sim-
ulations of dense gas-particle flow [42]. Gas and solid phases are
coupled via voidage (Îµf) and source terms regarding momentum ex-
change (Ffp), heat transfer exchange (Qfp), and species exchange (R), for
which the corresponding sub-models are given and discussed in the
following sections.

In the translational and rotational equations of each particle, the

where the subscripts n and t refer to the normal and tangential compo-
nents, respectively. k and Î· represent the stiffness coefficient and
damping coefficient, respectively. Î´ and vr are the overlap and relative
velocity of a collision pair, respectively. Î¼ is the friction coefficient. nij
and tij are the unit vectors along the normal direction and tangential
direction of a collision pair, respectively. Inter-particle interactions
consist of direct and non-direct contact forces. The direct force is divided
into elastic contact force and viscous damping force [45], which can be
calculated by the hard-sphere contact model or soft-sphere contact
model [15]. The hard-sphere model has the advantage of low compu-
tational cost because of its event-driven nature. However, it is not
suitable for dense gas-solid systems with multiple collisions as it only
treats single collision pairs. To address this issue, the soft-sphere contact
model with a time-driven strategy can be used. This model calculates the
elastic contact force and damping force based on a spring-dashpot-slider
assumption. It relates the contact force to the overlap displacement and
particle properties such as spring constant, Youngâs modulus, Poisson
ratio, and damping coefficient. This approach allows for a more accurate
representation of dense gas-solid systems with multiple collisions [46].
Several soft-sphere contact models have been put forth [47]. Among
them, the linear spring dashpot (LSD) and non-linear Hertzian models
have gained substantial popularity when it comes to modelling dense
gas-solid flow [14,15]. In the case of the former model, the normal
damping coefficient Î·n,ij is closely associated with the normal restitution
coefficient en,ij:

[52]. Table 1 provides a comprehensive overview of the common
methods used for characterizing non-spherical particles. These methods
include real geometry, glued sphere, polyhedron, and super-quadric
approaches. The specific formulas for each method have been thor-
oughly documented in previous literature [27]. This table focuses on
comparing key aspects such as accuracy, computational cost, shape
representation, contact detection, and force calculation to facilitate
comparative analysis. Within the realm of non-spherical particle char-
acterization, the real geometry method stands out for its commendable
accuracy and low computational cost. However, it should be noted that
this method is limited in its representation capabilities, primarily
encompassing certain shapes
and
sphero-cylinders. On the other hand, the glued sphere method, while
offering a lower accuracy level, presents a more economical computa-
tional cost. As for the polyhedron method, both its accuracy and
computational cost depend on the resolution employed, allowing for the
description of nearly all
types of non-spherical particles. The
super-quadric method shows high accuracy and medium computational
cost, which can represent more than 80% of non-spherical particles in
nature via adjusting several key model parameters [53]. Until now, the
last three methods have been integrated into the CFD-DEM framework
to simulate thermochemical characteristics of dense gas-solid reacting
flow, in terms of chip-like particles in rotary drums [54,55], spout
deflection in fluidized beds [56], biomass fast pyrolysis in fixed beds
[57â59], and fuel conversion in a pellet stove [60]. The contact algo-
rithm, detection method, and interpolation method for simulating
non-spherical particulate flow have been widely discussed in the open
literature [27,61,62], thus they are not given in the present review.
Besides, the shape effect in calculating the inter-phase momentum, en-
ergy, and species exchanges is still an open issue requiring further theory
and mechanism study. The discussion of it is also not presented in the
current review.

2.1.4. Drag model

The drag model potentially influences the thermochemical proper-
ties of dense gas-solid reacting flow due to its close relationship with bed
hydrodynamics [64]. The inter-phase momentum exchange item (Ffp) is
formulated as:

The non-linear Hertzian model, commonly used in dense gas-solid
flow simulations, involves the calculation of both normal and tangen-
tial spring stiffness. These stiffness values can be derived from funda-
mental material properties, such as Youngâs modulus and Poisson ratio

While the non-linear Hertzian model has been extensively employed
in particulate flow simulations, it requires significant computational
expenses. A recent sensitivity analysis showcased that the calculation
time required for the non-linear Hertzian model was approximately 6.8
times longer than that for the LSD model when simulating biomass
gasification in a fluidized bed [37].

2.1.3. Shape characterization model

Although spherical particle assumption for bed materials and reac-
tive particles is commonly employed in modelling dense gas-solid flow
due to easy implementation, particles in practical chemical engineering
processes are naturally non-spherical. The particle morphology is known
to have a significant influence on the flow and thermochemical behav-
iours of chemical engineering processes [27]. For example,
the
non-spherical particles have a poor fluidization capacity and need to be
assisted with bed materials (i.e., sand) or high superficial gas velocities

where the interphase momentum exchange coefficient (Î²) is introduced
to effectively capture the intricate hydrodynamic interactions, which
strongly depend on factors such as particle Reynolds number (Re), solid
void fraction (Îµs), and other variables. Chemical reactions lead to a large
particle size disparity, which needs further modifications of Î² applicable
for polydisperse particles. Accordingly, the monodisperse and poly-
disperse drag models are required in CFD-DEM simulations.

Several monodisperse drag models commonly used in CFD-DEM
modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow are summarized in Table S1
of Supplementary Materials. The monodisperse drag model is mainly
derived from normalized drag F(Îµs, Re) based on Stokes-Einstein equa-
tions [65]. Via fitting experimental data or DNS results, the mono-
disperse drag models are derived, including those: (i) based on the
experimental measurements, e.g., Gidaspow drag model [66] and
Syamlal-OâBrien drag model [67]; (ii) based on the DNS, e.g., Koch-Hill
drag model [68,69], Beetstra-Van der Hoef-Kuipers (BVK) drag model
[70], Rong drag model [71] and other advanced drag models [72,73],
which derive correlations from static arrays of particles with low Rey-
nolds number to moving particles with high Reynolds number; (iii)
based on the filtered operation from fine-grid simulations, e.g., filtered
drag models [74â77]; (iv) based on the mesoscale heterogeneous
structure, e.g., Energy-Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) drag model
[78â80]. Among monodisperse drag models, the one proposed by
Gidaspow [66] is the most used one, which has a sharp alternation due

to the discontinuity by switching from Ergun correlation to Wen-Yu
correlation at the voidage of 0.8, giving rise to numerical instability.
Homogeneous models derived from experiments and DNS, where par-
ticles are uniformly distributed, are generally suitable for modelling
moderately dense gas-solid systems with coarse particles (e.g., Geldart B
and D particles). In a comprehensive study [74], eight drag models were
evaluated for Geldart A particles, including five heterogeneous and three
homogeneous drag models. Comparisons with experimental data high-
lighted the need to modify homogeneous drag models to account for
mesoscale structures (e.g., bubbles and clusters). Filtered drag models
and EMMS drag models demonstrated superior predictive accuracy
across all fluidization regimes, whereas other models were limited to
specific regimes [74]. When the grid is fine enough to resolve hetero-
geneous structures like clusters and bubbles, homogeneous drag models
can be safely applied. However, for coarser grids, sub-grid modelling is
necessary to account for unresolved drag forces, with filtered and EMMS
drag models offering effective solutions.

Taking the EMMS drag model to elucidate the solution concept. The
EMMS drag model represents local heterogeneous gas-solid flows
through flow field decomposition and energy minimization, which di-
vides the flow into three pseudo-phases: the dilute phase, dense phase,
and suspended clusters [81]. The dilute phase refers to individual par-
ticles suspended in the gas phase, while the dense phase describes par-
ticles and gas within clusters. The suspended clusters phase treats the
cluster as a whole entity moving through the gas phase. Drag forces in
each of these pseudo-phases are calculated using the conventional
Wen-Yu drag model. For the dilute and dense phases, the particle
diameter is used to calculate drag force, whereas for the suspended
clusters phase, the cluster diameter is used [82]. Initially, this model was
only applicable to steady-state flows. Later, the model was extended to
transient flows by incorporating particle acceleration effects [79],
termed as EMMS-Yang drag model. The model was further refined by
including acceleration terms for both the dilute and dense phases,
leading to the development of the EMMS-Matrix drag model [83]. This
approach has proven to be effective in modelling multiphase flows in
circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers [78,84]. However, challenges
remain, particularly for accurately correlating cluster diameter. Addi-
tional assumptions are often required to numerically adjust the EMMS
models for specific operating conditions, significantly increasing the
complexity of using this model [82].

In dense gas-solid reacting systems, particles are typically poly-
disperse rather than monodisperse. This is because of the topological
variations, such as shrinkage and cracks, that occur during chemical
reactions, as well as the intrinsic types of materials involved, such as
inert sand or reactive feedstock. The wide size distribution of particles
leads to different mixing or segregation rates, which highly affect in-
furnace thermochemical efficiency. For example, the metallurgical in-
dustries require minerals with a wide size distribution to be classified
into productions with several certain sizes [85]. The coal gasification
process needs the particles with a wide size distribution to be well mixed
to perform uniform heat and mass transfer [86]. Moreover, it has been
demonstrated by many experiments that a lower gas velocity promotes

the segregation rate while a higher gas velocity improves the mixing rate
in fluidized beds within polydisperse particles [87,88]. However, the
drag models derived from monodisperse particles cannot accurately
predict momentum exchange between fluidizing agents and particles in
polydisperse systems due to disparities in size and density [89].

Two methods have been proposed to develop polydisperse drag
models based on the monodisperse drag models [65]. For the first
method, the drag force of each particle can be directly evaluated using
monodisperse drag models and all drag forces for different types of
particles are summed. The parameters of Îµsi and Rei are obtained from
the specific individual particle. For the second method, the total drag
force fd is calculated by averaging the parameters of the system, and
then it is distributed to different types of particles. The averaging
operation for particle parameters is given by:

Several typical polydisperse drag models deduced based on the
above two methods are summarized in Table S2 of Supplementary Ma-
terials. The polydisperse drag models have been widely applied to study
size-induced mixing and segregation in cold particulate systems with a
particle size distribution (PSD) [65,89]. A more accurate prediction of
the mixing process of binary particles in a fluidized bed can be achieved
utilizing the polydisperse drag model than the monodisperse model
[90]. Thus, a polydisperse drag model is recommended when simulating
dense gas-solid reacting systems with large particle size disparities.

2.1.5. Mapping algorithm

In the CFD-DEM framework, the gas phase and particle phase are
modelled using the CFD and DEM approaches, respectively. The inte-
gration of these two methodologies necessitates the establishment of a
connection or âbridgeâ between them. As depicted in Fig. 4, the particle
model relies on the local gas field quantities as its boundary conditions,
while the influence of the particleâs presence must be incorporated into
the governing equations of the gas phase through a source term. This
mutual exchange of information ensures an interaction between the two
phases within the simulation. The calculation of voidage (Îµf) and map-
ping of quantities (Î¾) from the discrete particle to the continuous phase
are achieved by several methods, termed coarse-graining, averaging, or
aggregation in the open literature [91â101]. The commonly used map-
ping methods for the CFD-DEM include the particle centroid method
(PCM), divided particle volume method (DPVM), two-grid method
(TGM), and statistical kernel method (also termed diffusion-based
method, DBM) (Fig. 4).

The most used one is the PCM in which particles with centroid in a
specific cell are summed up. The voidage (Îµf) in the PCM framework is
given by:

Îµf = 1 (cid:0) 1
Vc

â

Np
1 Vp,i

(16)

where Np is the number of particles with centroid in this cell. The PCM

presents a straightforward approach that boasts high numerical effi-
ciency. However, its implementation is known to pose challenges with
fine grids, and inaccuracies can arise at cell boundaries. This is espe-
cially apparent when the particle centroid is positioned close to the cell
boundary, where the PCM can exhibit an error of up to 50 % [103]. To
ensure a suitable balance between numerical stability and prediction
accuracy, it is recommended that the cell size should be at least 3.82
times larger than the particle diameter when utilizing this methodology
[103].

To circumvent the drawbacks of the PCM, the DPVM in which a
specific particle is decomposed into a cloud of subpoints Mp with a nu-
merical weight wi,j [97,98]:

(17)

where the weight for particle i is summing to unity. The DPVM gives a
smoother voidage field and improved prediction accuracy than the PCM
[103]. Nonetheless, the implementation of this methodology entails an
added computational burden due to the requirement of associating
subpoints with grid cells. This process can be particularly costly when
dealing with unstructured grids. Moreover, it is important to note that
including small cells within the computational domain, wherein the size
is comparable to or smaller than the particle diameter, can lead to the
occurrence of unphysical voidage within these cells. Consequently, it is
imperative to ensure that the cell size employed in this methodology
exceeds the diameter of the particles to avoid such issues.

The deficiency of the PCM and DPVM in the case of small cell size to
particle diameter has recently been addressed by the TGM [104â106].
The main idea is to use two independent sets of grids, i.e., fine grids for
CFD calculation and coarse grids for the mapping procedure. The
mapping mesh is chosen based on the PCM theory in which the cell size
is larger than the particle diameter (commonly used Îx > 3dp) while the
CFD mesh is selected according to the practical requirement of flow
resolution. For meshes with arbitrarily aligned cells, the TGM is hard to
implement and the interpolation between neighbouring cells is tricky.
To address the issue of numerical instability arising from particles
occupying entire cells or generating excessively large source terms, the
statistical kernel method has emerged. This method involves smoothing
the discrete quantities (Î¾) onto continuous fluid grids through the use of
a grid-independent Gaussian kernel, accomplished by employing an
isotropic diffusion equation. By adopting this technique, the accuracy

and stability of the simulation can be significantly improved, providing a
viable solution to the aforementioned challenges. The isotropic diffusion
equation is given by Refs. [91,94,95]:

(18)

where Î» is the smoothing length, which is commonly chosen as several
times the particle diameter (Î» = 2dp ~ 3dp) for a monodisperse system to
capture detailed mesoscale flow features [91,107]. For polydisperse
systems with a particle size distribution, Î» is selected as the maximum
particle diameter (Î» = max(dp)) [91]. The smoothing operation is con-
servative, which has been further developed and applied in many studies
[91â94,99,107,108]. In a word, statistical kernel mapping is a theoret-
ically elegant method for linking quantities from discrete phase to a
continuum property of fluid phase) [101,109]. It should be mentioned
that there are several key considerations when solving the diffusion
equation. (i) Selecting appropriate timesteps and spatial discretization is
crucial for solution stability. For explicit schemes, the time step must be
sufficiently small to meet stability criteria, while implicit schemes,
although more computationally demanding, may offer enhanced sta-
bility. (ii) Choosing an appropriate smoothing length (Î») is essential for
accuracy. Î» is typically set as a multiple of the particle diameter (e.g.,
2dp ~ 3dp for monodisperse systems or max(dp) for polydisperse sys-
tems) to capture mesoscale features effectively. This choice balances
computational efficiency with accurate flow representation. (iii) Ad-
justments are necessary to ensure conservation when the particle
smoothing range extends beyond the wall. Techniques such as the vir-
tual symmetric point method [96,110] have been introduced to main-
tain conservation during the smoothing process. Recently, an improved
bilateral semi-resolved approach was developed to efficiently capture
particle-flow interphase details with enhanced accuracy and feasibility.
Applied to a rotary drum, the approach demonstrated its capability in
resolving transient flow behaviors with sharp gradients, providing
detailed insights into hydrodynamics, particle mixing, and axial
dispersion under varying friction and restitution conditions [111].

Evaluation of several mapping algorithms with a layer-based ther-
mally thick particle model indicated that while the PCM has a strong
dependency on grid size, the TGM and statistical kernel method are grid-
independent and with significantly improved predictability [102]. It
was observed that an undersized coupling length resulted in an

underestimation of heating and devolatilization processes, while an
oversized coupling length led to an overestimation of O2 concentration
and a weakened influence of gas phase reactions. These results suggest
that careful consideration of the coupling length is necessary when
implementing these mapping algorithms. The computational cost of the
DPVM, TGM, and statistical kernel method increases with grid resolu-
tion, but TGM is significantly more efficient than the DPVM and statis-
tical kernel method. TGM requires grid mapping only once at the
beginning, whereas DPVM involves repeated grid searching at every
fluid time step, leading to exponential cost increases with the number of
particles. Although the statistical kernel method incurs higher compu-
tational costs for fine grids, it remains comparable to the cost of solving
gas-phase governing equations, making it feasible. Recently, CFD-DEM
coupled with a TGM has been used to simulate high-speed lateral gas
injection into a packed bed reactor, with a fine grid for the gas phase and
a coarse grid for the discrete phase. This method enables accurate res-
olution of the gas phase at high Reynolds numbers while maintaining
computational efficiency [105]. Compared to TGM, the statistical kernel
method offers the advantage of being well-suited for unstructured grids.
Recently, the TGM and statistical kernel method were integrated with
the CFD-DEM framework to strike an optimal balance between compu-
tational efficiency, solver robustness, and prediction accuracy [112].
This innovative approach incorporated the impacts of inter-particle
conduction and radiation, resulting in more comprehensive simulations.
In summary, the PCM and DPVM are the two mainstream mapping
methods in CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow with
the quantities of mass, momentum, and energy interpolated back and
forth between the discrete phase and continuum phase. The TGM is grid-
independent but suffers from the hard implementation of unstructured
meshes. The statistical kernel method is a potential one applicable to the
massively parallel simulation of dense gas-solid reacting flow in complex
geometries with unstructured meshes.

2.2. Heat transfer models

2.2.1.

Isothermal assumption

In the majority of CFD-DEM simulations focusing on dense gas-solid
reacting flow, the common approach assumes isothermal conditions,
where thermal gradients within individual particles are disregarded.
The governing equations for homogeneous, spherical particles devoid of
thermal heat generation can be expressed in a dimensionless form [113]:

where Î· represents the dimensionless radial position inside a specific
particle with the diameter of Rp. Î is the dimensionless temperature,
based on the gas temperature and solid reference temperature Tp,ref. Fo is
the Fourier number. Bi is the Biot number related to the particle prop-
erties, which is denoted as the ratio of conduction through a particle to
its heat storage. Fig. 5 gives the classification of the Biot number on the
temperature distribution of a particle. The temperature difference be-
tween the particleâs centroid and surface is less than 5 % when the Biot
number is below 0.1 [114]. Given the negligible impact of such a small
temperature difference, compared to the complexity involved in
resolving temperature gradients within particles,
is commonly
assumed in most CFD-DEM simulations of dense gas-solid reacting sys-
tems that the particles exhibit isothermal behaviour [45,115]. A Biot
number greater than 10 indicates heat transfer that is limited by internal
conduction [116]. Thermal gradients often take place during wood py-
rolysis because the wood has low thermal conductivity and it is difficult
in the kinetically controlled modulus [117]. Hence, a particle is typically

it

classified as thermally thick when it exceeds a certain size, indicating the
presence of significant thermal gradients within the particle [116,
118â120].

Due to the extensive applications of isothermal particle assumption
in most CFD-DEM simulations of dense gas-solid reacting flow [35,37,
45,115,121,122], section 2.2 presents the heat transfer sub-models
based on this scenario. The thermochemical treatment for a large Biot
number will be discussed in section 2.3, where a large-size fuel particle
with a large Biot number experiences different competing reactions
between the particle surface and particle interior.

2.2.2. Convective heat transfer

The convective heat flux (Qfp,i) is determined by the convective heat
transfer coefficient (hpf,i), particle surface area (Ap,i), and temperature
difference (Tf - Tp,i), as expressed by:

Qfp,i = hpf,iAp,i

Tf (cid:0) Tp,i

(cid:0)

)

(21)

The convective heat transfer coefficient (hpf,i) can be related to the
gas thermal conductivity (Îºg) and dimensionless Nusselt number (Nu), as
follows:

hpf,i = Nudp,i

Îºf

(22)

where Nu is a combination of particle Reynolds number (Re) and gas
Prandtl number (Pr = Î¼fCp,f/Îºf). Many empirical correlations for Nu have
been proposed in the past decades [123â126], and they are generally
categorized into two classical forms:

Nu = a1 + (a2Rea3 + a3Rea4 )Prc

(23)

(

where c = 1/3 is specified in most cases because it is derived from a
boundary layer theory. ai (i = 1â5) and bj (j = 1â9) are fitted from
empirical correlations and the PR-DNS database.

(a) Empirical correlations

A well-known correlation for a single particle was proposed as [125]:

Nu = 2 + 0.6Re1/2 Pr1/3

(25)

After that, a Nu correlation for a spherical particle was developed as

[127]:

Nu = 2 +

Pr0.4

(26)

A Nu correlation for packed beds valid for a voidage of 0.4 was
proposed via correlating the experimental data for heat transfer [126]:

Nu = 2 + 1.1Re0.6 Pr1/3

(27)

The voidage (Îµf) is not included in the above correlations, and thus
these correlations are not valid for an assembly of spherical particles
covering a wide range of porosities. The Nu correlation as a combination
of Îµf, Re, and Pr was improved by Gunn [123]:

(

(28)

The aforementioned correlation is obtained by theoretically fitting
experimental data and has been extensively used for calculating
convective heat transfer in fixed beds and fluidized beds. However, it is
important to acknowledge that empirical correlations for complex par-
ticulate systems have unique characteristics. Deriving Nusselt number
correlations from experimental measurements remains a challenging

endeavour due to the high costs and inherent opacity of multiphase
flows.

(b) Numerical correlations

As an alternative approach, PR-DNS provides a database that can be
used for fitting Nusselt number correlations. Fig. S1 of Supplementary
Materials illustrates the scatter plots for the Nusselt number as a func-
tion of the Reynolds number based on the PR-DNS database. Each
literature covers a specific range of operating conditions. By evaluating
Gunnâs correlation over a wider range of voidage (Îµf = 0.1â0.5), it was
observed that Gunnâs correlation significantly overestimated the Nusselt
number at Re â¤ 100 [128]. As shown in Table S3 of Supplementary
Materials, plenty of efforts have been made to improve the prediction
accuracy of Nu correlations by developing corresponding closures based
on the PR-DNS. Most of the above correlations were derived based on
homogeneous or random spherical particle systems. The Nu correlation
was further extended to the assembly of non-spherical particles [129],
and the Nu correlations derived from the spherical particles were still
applicable to the systems within sphero-cylinder particles.

2.2.3. Conductive heat transfer

Conductive heat transfer is often disregarded in studies due to its
minimal impact caused by limited contact areas and short durations
[130,131]. However, some studies have shown the significance of this
mode in simulating fixed bed (FB) and BFB systems with relatively weak
gas flow and frequent particle collisions [130â132]. Conductive heat
transfer includes both direct particle-particle heat transfer and indirect
particle-gas-particle heat
transfer modes. Several commonly used
particle-particle conductive heat transfer models are summarized in
Table S4 of Supplementary Materials. The conductive heat transfer
model proposed by Sun and Chen [131] is based on the Hertzian contact
theory in which the contact area is calculated according to the particle
properties. Several hypotheses were made in this model: (i) the thermal
resistance and curvature of the particle surface are ignored for the
contact area; (ii) temperature changes are restricted in a small region
around the contact area; (iii) heat transfer is one-dimensional and
perpendicular to the contact area; (iv) small Fourier number [131].
Besides, this model is heavily dependent on the correction factor c,
which is an empirical parameter adjusted to fit the heat transfer. How-
ever, this model overestimates the heat transfer under a large Fourier
number [133]. Thus, an analytic expression was proposed for the correct
factor [133], which improved the prediction accuracy with a large
Fourier number. The original model [131] and the modified model
[133] have been used in several CFD-DEM simulations of the heat
transfer process [34,124]. The limitation of this model lies in the large
computational costs for the resolution of each contact occurrence and
the additional efforts for the determination of correction factors. The
conductive heat transfer model developed by Batchelor and OâBrien
[134] is based on the Hertzian contact theory, where the contact radius
is determined using particle properties and normal contact force. This

transfer due to its

model has found extensive applications in CFD-DEM simulations of
particle-particle conductive heat
simplicity
[135â139]. However, it has certain limitations: (i) particles are assumed
to possess identical thermal conductivity, and (ii) it relies on the Hert-
zian contact model. To address these limitations, researchers extended
the model to include (i) a scenario with multiple-particle contacts by
introducing an effective thermal conductivity, and (ii) compatibility
with Hertzian and LSD contact models, aiming to reduce computational
burden [113].

In contrast to particle-particle conductive heat transfer, the particle-
gas-particle conductive heat transfer mode constitutes a significant
portion, accounting for approximately 10% â35% of the overall heat
transfer process [140]. Within the CFD-DEM framework, numerous
formulas have been developed to quantify this heat transfer mechanism
[140â143]. Table S5 of Supplementary Materials summarizes the
commonly employed particle-gas-particle heat
transfer models in
CFD-DEM simulations of dense gas-solid reacting flow, providing an
overview of the representation, advantages, and limitations associated
with each model.

2.2.4. Radiative heat transfer

â¦

In a dense gas-solid reacting system, radiative heat transfer occurs
between the particle surface and the surrounding media. In the CFD-
DEM simulation, the wall is commonly assumed to be adiabatic, thus
the radiative heat transfer between particles and the wall is commonly
neglected. Besides, gas-particle radiation is usually neglected due to low
gas emissivity [139]. The radiative heat transfer can be ignored when
the system temperature is lower than 600
C [139]. For dense gas-solid
reacting flow under high temperatures, radiative heat transfer should be
considered. Radiative heat transfer arises from the reflection, absorp-
tion, and emission of thermal radiation [144]. A surface that absorbs all
incident radiation without reflecting any is known as a blackbody or a
black surface. In contrast, real surfaces absorb and emit less radiation
than a blackbody. The absorptance of a surface is the fraction of incident
radiation it absorbs, while reflectance represents the fraction reflected.
Emittance refers to the ratio of a surfaceâs actual emissive power to that
of an ideal blackbody. Real surfaces are often approximated as grey
surfaces, where absorptance and emittance are assumed to be equal
[113]. The energy balance equation for two diffuse, grey surfaces can be
expressed as follows:

Qrad,ij =

ÏT4
p,j
+ 1
AsiFij

(cid:0) ÏT4
p,i
+ 1(cid:0) Îµp,j
Îµp,jAsj

1(cid:0) Îµp,i
Îµp,i Asi

(29)

where Tp,i and Tp,j are the temperature for particle i and particle j,
respectively. Îµp,i and Îµp,j are the emittance for particle i and particle j,
respectively. Asi and Asj are the surface areas for particle i and particle j,
respectively. Fij is the shape factor, representing the fraction of radiation
emitted by surface i that is absorbed by surface j. Surface factors for
different configurations can be found in previous references [114,145].
Within the context of a dense gas-solid reacting system, a substantial

temperature discrepancy results in intense radiation occurring between
particle i and the surrounding particles within a specific sub-domain.
This sub-domain is a spherical region encompassing the relevant parti-
cles [146]. Thus, the view factor Fij is equal to unity while the emissivity
also approaches unity due to the nearly black surface. The above
equation can be simplified as:
(

This equation has been widely used to simulate radiative heat
transfer [37,115,137,139,141,147,148]. The primary difference be-
tween these models lies in how they define the environmental temper-
ature, Tenv. Several definitions commonly used are discussed below.

One definition of environment temperature is obtained by averaging

the temperature of all particles in a system as follows [34,45]:

associated flow hydrodynamics. In the present review, we mainly focus
on the dense gas-solid two-phase flow. The models related to homoge-
neous reactions have been well documented in various studies
[149â153], thus the models involving heterogeneous reactions are
mainly presented here. Specifically, this section will outline three as-
pects: (i) reaction rate; (ii) heat of reaction; and (iii) particle conversion
model.

2.3.1. Reaction rate

The rate equation for a particular chemical reaction is an algebraic
function that establishes a relationship between the reaction rate and the
properties of the particles involved [154]. To elucidate this, we consider
a heterogeneous reaction:

aA(g) + bB(s) â cC(g) + dD(s)

(34)

(35)

Tenv = 1
Np

â

Np
j=1Tp,j

(31)

The rate of consumption of species A can be defined as:

Î²
Î±
(cid:0) rA = kC
AC
B

where Np is the total number of particles in the domain. This definition
assumes that all particles are exposed to the same radiative heat flux. For
example, an isolated particle would receive the same radiative heat flux
as a particle at the same temperature, even if it is surrounded by other
particles with temperatures that deviate significantly from the average
solid temperature. Compared to this definition, a more localized defi-
nition of Tenv, based on the specific conditions of each particle, is
preferred [139]:

Tenv = Îµf Tf,Î© +

where the environment temperature is calculated based on the contents
of a sub-domain Î© surrounding particle i. Np,Î© is the number of particles
in the sub-domain. The radius of the subdomain is commonly defined as
1.5 times the diameter of the particle [37,113,139]. Although this
definition addresses the limitation observed in Eq. (31), by incorpo-
rating the gas temperature, Eq. (32) implies that particle-gas radiative
heat transfer should be considered. Particle-gas radiative heat transfer is
typically excluded from CFD-DEM simulations of dense gas-solid react-
ing flow, which is why this definition of environmental temperature is
generally not adopted. Accordingly, the environment temperature suit-
able for modelling radiative heat transfer of dense gas-solid flow is
defined as [113]:

Tenv = 1

(33)

This definition considers the temperature of the surrounding parti-
cles and assumes negligible radiative heat transfer between the gas and
particle. Note that Eq. (32) is very similar to each of the above for
environment temperature. That is, equating Np,Î© to Np in Eq. (33) pro-
duces Eq. (31) while setting Îµf = 0 in Eq. (32) results in Eq. (33).

2.3. Chemical reaction models

Chemical reactions in dense gas-solid reacting flow can occur in
either a single phase, referred to as homogeneous reactions, or involve
more than two phases, known as heterogeneous reactions. The reaction
kinetics is the key part for the modelling of chemical reactions in dense
gas-solid reacting flow or even multi-phase reacting flow. The interplay
between reaction kinetics and two-/multi-phase flow dynamics signifi-
cantly increases modelling complexity because these two aspects are
tightly coupled and influence each other in non-linear ways. Reaction
kinetics determine the rate at which chemical reactions occur, often
depending on local variables such as temperature, pressure, and con-
centration. In multi-phase flow reacting systems, these variables are
spatially and temporally heterogeneous due to the interactions between
liquid-solid) and the
different phases (e.g., gas-solid, gas-liquid,

where k is the rate coefficient. CA and CB stand for the concentration of
reactants A and B, respectively. Î± and Î² represent empirically fitted
constants. The reaction rate and stoichiometric coefficient have a
relation:
(cid:0) rB
(cid:0) rA

d

(36)

=

where the consumption rates of species A and B and the generation of
species C and D are linked. The particle-scale approach in modelling
dense gas-solid reacting flow allows for a natural definition of the re-
action rate in terms of particle surface area. Alternatively, definitions
based on fluid volume or cell volume require averaging the formation or
consumption of solid species by summing up particles within a specific
cell. This treatment may deteriorate the advantage of CFD-DEM in
tracking individual particles during chemical reactions [113].

2.3.2. Heat of reaction

The heat of reaction (ÎH) can be defined as the amount of heat
released or absorbed during a chemical reaction. It is directly associated
with the difference in enthalpy between the products and reactants
[154]. Positive enthalpy change gives rise to an endothermic reaction,
demonstrating that the heat is introduced from outside the system to
support the reaction process. On the contrary, negative enthalpy change
leads to an exothermic reaction, indicating that the heat is released in-
side the system. The heat of reaction is written as:

ÎH = (Hc + HD) (cid:0) (HA + HB)

The enthalpy of species n at temperature T is written as:

The heat of reaction for a single particle is formulated as follows:

(39)

where Hprod and Hreact are the enthalpy of the products and reactants,
respectively. The heat of reaction and enthalpy transfer resulting from
mass transfer are typically incorporated into the source terms of the
energy conservation equations for the solid phase.

2.3.3. Particle conversion models

(i) Thermally thin particles

In dense gas-solid reacting systems, the density and diameter of solid
fuel particles vary over time due to chemical reactions such as drying,

pyrolysis, gasification, or combustion. Each heterogeneous reaction
process is governed by the intrinsic reaction rate and the transport rate
of reactants [155]. The entire process is determined by the slowest
process if the reaction rate is different from the transport rate. A
dimensionless form of the transport equation for gaseous species in the
pores of a specific particle is formulated as:

P), the Thiele modulus (kcSÏPl2
P

where the dimensionless variables Fo, Th, and Ï represent the Fourier
number (ÏPD0,P/l2
/D0,P), and the ratio of
diffusion coefficient (Dâ/D0), respectively. A small Thiele modulus rep-
resents a low reaction rate but a high diffusion rate, which demonstrates
that only a small fraction of reactants transferred to the surface of solid
fuel particles are consumed. In contrast, most reactants can diffuse to the
interior of a specific particle, and the reactive agents are distributed
within the entire particle where chemical reactions occur. Under this
circumstance, the reacting core model should be used (Fig. 6(a)).
Furthermore, the conversion rate can be remarkably improved via better
external heat and mass transfer by increasing the surface of solid fuel
particles. A large Thiele modulus means a high reaction rate, which
indicates ambient gas rapidly reacts with the outer surface or the shell of
a specific particle. Therefore, the solid fuel particle is gradually
consumed from the exterior and no or only a small number of reactants
penetrate the particle interior, causing the shrinkage of the particle.
Under this circumstance, the shrinking core model should be adopted
(Fig. 6(b)). The reacting core model (Ïp
p ) and shrinking core
model (dp =
6mp/ÏÏp
) are two of the most applicable ones that
have been implemented in CFD-DEM codes for modelling dense gas-
solid reacting flow [35,37,115,122,156,157]:

= 6mp/Ïd3

)
1/3

(cid:0)

In the reacting core model, the particle density is gradually lost while
the particle diameter remains constant, which leads to a change in

thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and other variables of the
particle over time. This variation needs to be considered in conductive
heat transfer calculation [113]. In the context of the shrinking core
model, the reduction in particle diameter leads to significant disparities
in particle sizes. However, as the particle size difference increases, the
detection and storage of particle contact information become compu-
tationally challenging [113]. While the shrinking core model has been
successfully integrated into various CFD-DEM codes [35,45,121,
159â161], there is a requirement for enhanced modelling flexibility to
accommodate a wider range of scenarios. The shrinking unreacted core
model circumvents the above issue by assuming an ash shell with a
constant diameter during the particle shrinkage process (Fig. 6(c)). It has
also been implemented in several CFD-DEM codes [162,163]. Progres-
sive models extend the shrinking core/unreacted core models to porous
particles. The progressive models include a shrinking core (Fig. 6(d))
and a shrinking unreacted core (Fig. 6(e)). The reactions occur in a re-
action zone and gradually grow inwards. These two models have distinct
treatments for the ash, which is removed in the former while preserved
in the latter. In the progress model with a shrinking unreacted core, the
external shell of ash is formed during the reaction. From a certain
instant, the reaction region detaches it from the surface of the particle
and begins to move inwards. After a specific point in time, the reaction
region becomes detached from the particle surface and starts to move
inward. The progress models have been incorporated into CFD-DEM
codes to investigate the iron ore reduction process [164â166].

(ii) Thermally thick particles

In the thermochemical conversion of coarse solid fuel particles
within dense gas-solid reacting systems, numerical simulations should
not only consider the surrounding operating conditions such as pressure,
temperature, and species concentration but also take into account the
In particular, the
intrinsic properties of the particles themselves.

from most of

thermochemical conversion of solid fuels relies on three key processes:
heat transfer to the particle (external heat transfer), heat transfer within
the particle (internal heat transfer), and chemical reactions. The sig-
nificance of each process determines the limiting step that governs the
overall process [116]. Apart
the studies using an
isothermal assumption of solid fuel particles [35,45,121,159â161], Pe-
terâs group [30,167] and Kuâs group [118] both considered the ther-
mochemical transport (i.e., temperature and species) of the gaseous
agent in the porous space of the particle obeying Darcyâs law [168] on
in-house code and open-source software package, respectively. Note that
the particle is assumed as isotropic, which means the thermochemical
properties only change along the radial direction. Besides, the shrinkage
of particles during the thermochemical conversion process is neglected.
The mass, momentum, energy, and species conservation equations of
gaseous agents in the pore space of the particle are summarized in
Table S6 of Supplementary Materials. These governing equations can
effectively model various particle geometries by adjusting the variable
n, encompassing scenarios such as an infinite plate (n = 0), infinite
cylinder (n = 1), and sphere (n = 2). The thermally thick model, as in-
tegrated into the CFD-DEM framework by Ku et al. [118], builds upon
the discretization method proposed by Papadikis et al. [169] and in-
corporates the layer concept introduced by Str Ìom and Thunman [119],
as well as G Ìomez et al. [170]. In contrast to the isotropic particle
treatment presented by Mohseni and Peters [171], this model divides
the particle into three distinct layers: the wet wood layer, the dry wood
layer, and the char layer. These layers play a crucial role in the thermally
thick model [118], as they interconnect during the thermochemical
conversion process, particularly during pyrolysis, and each layer pos-
sesses unique physical properties. During the thermochemical conver-
sion of the particle, a layer and its adjacent layers undergo mass and
energy exchange through an interface that displaces along the radial
direction. This interface can be identified by monitoring the mass loss of
the particle. To accurately capture temperature and species gradients,
each material layer is further discretized into multiple grids. A total of
50 grids are assigned within the particle to ensure both numerical ac-
curacy and computational efficiency in a recent simulation of biomass
pyrolysis [118]. The particle diameter, thermal conductivity, and spe-
cific heat capacity of each layer remain constant in the simulation.

The difference between these two models lies in: (i) the particle in
the model of Mohseni and Peters [171] is assumed as porous media with
the gaseous agent diffusing through it while the particle in the model
from Ku et al. [118] is assumed as a solid sphere without the mass
transfer of gaseous agents inside it; (ii) the model from Ku et al. [118] is
grid dependent because the particle is divided into a certain number of
elements (e.g., 50); along the radial direction while the model from
Mohseni and Peters [171] is grid independent because the variables can
be directly integrated along the radial direction of the particle. Recently,
the thermally thick model has been also implemented in the open-source
software package to study biomass fast pyrolysis in a fixed bed [57]. The
CFD-DEM simulation considering thermal and species gradients inside
the particle could achieve better results than that with the isothermal
assumption of biomass particles with large sizes. Fig. 7 gives the com-
parison of particle temperature and solid mass loss from Mahmoudi et al.
[172] and Ku et al. [118] with the experiment regarding the drying
process of a near-spherical poplar particle with 6.0 wt% moisture con-
tent [173]. The discrepancy observed in the predicted particle centre
temperature in both simulations can be attributed to the fact that the
temperature measured by the radial thermocouple exhibits a faster rate
of increase compared to that measured by the axial thermocouple [172,
173].

The above analysis is based on the single particle. A diagram was
built where the conversion of a single particle and a packed bed is ar-
ranged depending on the Damk Ìohler number Da and Thiele modulus Th
[155] (see Fig. 8). The line of Da = 1 and Th = 1 in the diagram means
the boundary of combustion regimes and are formulated as:

(42)

where klB/DB represents the ratio of the reaction time scale to the
diffusion time scale, while lB/lP denotes the ratio of the characteristic
length of the bed to that of the particle. Additionally, Î´ represents the
internal surface area per unit volume of the particle, which serves as a
measure of the particleâs internal pore structure. Four distinct combus-
tion regimes can be determined from the diagram (Fig. 8) by combining
Da and Th. Da <1 represents the well-stirred reactor in which each
particle emerges with sufficient gaseous agents due to the transport-
dominating property of the system and the whole conversion is not
dependent on the mass of solid fuels. Specifically, the shrinking core
model should be used for poor transport compared to the reactive term
within the particle (Th > 1), which means a conversion front penetrates
the particle. The increased conversion gives rise to the reacting core
model (Th < 1), for which the entire particle reacts. For high reaction
rates (Da >1), the mass transfer rate from the gaseous agents to a par-
ticle is larger compared to the transport rate, thus only a small number of
particles in the packed bed are supplied with an oxidizer to keep a re-
action and the increase of fuel mass causes larger conversion times. The
conversion front may separate the reacted part and the unreacted part of
the packed bed, leading to one of the particle conversion models being
predominant. For Th < 1, there is no concentration gradient inside a
particle, thus the reaction is mainly controlled by heat and mass transfer
and is called a filtration combustion regime. For Th > 1, particles in the
zone of the conversion front confirm the shrinking core model. The di-
agram provides an understanding of selecting particle conversion
models in CFD-DEM simulation of dense gas-solid reacting flow in
chemical reactors.

2.4. Speed-up methods

The computational cost of CFD-DEM simulations lies in two parts,
namely the CFD and DEM. For the dense gas-solid flow, the computa-
tional cost from the DEM part is usually much larger than that from the
CFD part due to the numerous numbers of particles. The coarse-grained
model can reduce the number of computational particles greatly.
Because particle computing with DEM is much simpler than solving the
Navier-Stokes (NS) equations in CFD, and the computing mode of the
particle naturally suits for massively parallel computing mode of some
high-performance hardware, e.g., graphics processing unit (GPU) and
parallel
the
computing time of DEM might be less than that of the CFD. In this
section, we outline several strategies to accelerate CFD-DEM simulations
of dense gas-solid reacting flow. These approaches primarily include
hardware acceleration techniques and numerical acceleration methods.
For the latter, we will discuss the applicability, limitations, and pros-
pects of various advanced methods, such as the coarse-grained method,
the Recurrence CFD method, and the machine learning method.

2.4.1. Hardware acceleration technique

GPUs are efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image
processing. Their parallel structure makes them more efficient than
general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that
process large blocks of data in parallel. GPU is commonly applied to the
parallel simulation of pure particle flow under the DEM framework with
a message passing interface (MPI) for information communication.
Recently, the CPU has been widely combined with the GPU for the
parallel simulation of dense gas-solid flow under the CFD-DEM frame-
work with the CPU calculating the continuous gas phase and the GPU
modelling the discrete particle phase. A typical GPU-CPU hybrid code

when Radeke et al. [175] developed a specialized simulation tool using
C and CUDA. Their approach employs massively parallel CUDA tech-
niques on GPUs to implement DEM algorithms, enabling simulations of
more than two million particles per gigabyte of memory on standard
hardware. This innovation allowed for the numerical study of granular
flows involving millions of particles at a significantly faster rate
compared to traditional software solutions. In the following decade,
numerous studies expanded on the GPU-based DEM method, further
enhancing its application and efficiency. For instance, Jajcevic et al.
[176] developed an in-house GPU-based DEM code that was integrated
with AVL-Fire, allowing for the simulation of large-scale spout beds with
up to 25 million particles. Norouzi et al. [174] introduced a new
GPU-based CFD-DEM method that combined an open-source CFD solver
with their in-house DEM code, demonstrating significant speed-up per-
formance across three different cases of gas-solid two-phase flow. Sou-
sani et al. [177] used a combination of ANSYS Fluent and EDEM to
simulate an aggregate dryer containing approximately 540,000 parti-
cles. Lu et al. [178] also developed a GPU-based DEM code that was
integrated with a CFD model to study granular and gas-solid two-phase
flows, coupling a Fortran-based CFD solver with a CUDA/C++ based
DEM solver. In recent years, advancements in GPU hardware, particu-
larly with the introduction of high-performance GPUs like the NVIDIA
A100 and A800, have significantly accelerated DEM computations. Gou
et al. [179,180] developed a robust highly-efficient GPU-powered
CFD-DEM coupling approach that is capable of simulating large-scale
gas-solid reacting flow systems with complex geometries. Using an
NVIDIA A100 GPU, the total calculation time for the physical time of 20
s is 46.1 h, which is 2.2 times faster compared to the model using the
particle parallel method. According to previous literature,
is
well-established that GPUs consistently reduce the computational costs
of CFD-DEM simulations across various scenarios of cold gas-solid flow,
such as those in rotating drums, CFB risers, spouted beds, and Wurster
beds [176,178,179,181â183]. Furthermore, in a recent publication
[184], a detailed performance assessment was performed by comparing
the key subroutines for heat transfer and chemical reaction sub-models
between CPU-based and GPU-based CFD-DEM reactive methods. It was
evident that GPUs enhanced the performance of all subroutines in
CFD-DEM simulations for dense gas-solid reacting flow, underscoring
their effectiveness in improving computational efficiency.

enhance the computational efficiency of CFD-DEM simulations, it still

for the CFD-DEM simulation is illustrated in Fig. 9. The coupling section
of the algorithm has been parallelized using MPI, with all calculations
executed on the CPU. This coupling phase involves the computation of
crucial coupling parameters (Ffp, Îµf, and ffp) that are essential for the
fluid and solid phase equations. Determining these parameters necessi-
tates access to the position and velocity of the particle, as well as the
pressure and velocity fields of the fluid phase. The coupling process
commences by retrieving these variables from the DEM and CFD com-
ponents. Given that the DEM variables are stored in GPU memory, the
initial processor retrieves the DEM variables and distributes particle
data to other processors based on the spatial positions of the particles.
Consequently, each processor assumes responsibility for calculating a
subset of the coupling parameters, effectively distributing the compu-
tational load across multiple processors. To map particles onto fluid
cells, a tree-based search over the fluid mesh structure is used to
determine the cell in which a given point is located [174].

Table S7 of Supplementary Materials summarizes the recent appli-
cations of GPU for DEM scenarios and GPU-CPU hybrid code for CFD-
DEM scenarios. With the rapid development of GPU technology and
efficient numerical algorithms, DEM/CFD-DEM simulations of large-
scale systems can be achieved more cost-effectively than using the
conventional CPU mode. GPU-based DEM research dates back to 2010

presents considerable challenges: (i) Shift in programming paradigm.
The highly parallel nature of GPUs enables the execution of hundreds of
thousands of threads simultaneously, which is fundamentally different
from traditional CPU-based multi-core parallel computing. This requires
developers to adapt to the logic of GPU parallel programming and
rethink their approach during code development. (ii) Memory man-
agement on GPUs. GPUs are designed with multiple types of memory,
each with different sizes and access speeds. These differences can
significantly impact code performance. Therefore, developers must
thoroughly understand the characteristics of various memory types and
utilize them appropriately during code implementation to optimize
performance. These factors highlight the complexities involved in
developing GPUs for DEM simulations, despite their potential for sub-
stantial performance gains.

The utilization of multiple GPUs in the application is made possible
through the implementation of MPI, which assigns one GPU per MPI
process and facilitates inter-GPU communication [185]. While the cur-
rent multi-scale computation mode has already demonstrated a notable
speed-up, ongoing efforts are being made to further optimize its per-
formance, which is expected to yield significant improvements [186].
For instance, the CPU computation can use the multi-core architecture of
modern CPUs in a shared-memory manner to enhance efficiency.
Additionally, adopting more sophisticated particle indexing algorithms,
such as combining the existing cell-list method with the neighbour-list
method, can lead to enhanced computational efficiency. Overcoming
communication overhead between CPUs and between CPU-GPUs can be
achieved by overlapping communication with computation. This over-
lapping becomes particularly crucial when dealing with more intricate
particle interactions, including friction and rotation [186]. Besides,
dynamic load balancing is a technique used in GPU-based CFD-DEM
simulations to optimize computational efficiency by evenly distributing
workloads among processors in parallel computations [187,188]. In
such simulations, computational demands often vary due to uneven
particle distributions (e.g., clustering) or localized regions of complex
fluid-particle interactions [189]. Dynamic load balancing addresses
these challenges by continuously monitoring workload distribution and
dynamically redistributing tasks, such as transferring particles or cells
between processors. This ensures that all processors are utilized effi-
ciently, reducing idle time and improving parallel performance. The
technique is particularly effective in large-scale simulations with het-
erogeneous systems, where maintaining a balanced workload is critical

for scalability and simulation speed [190â192].

In the CFD side of the CFD-DEM simulations, various governing
equations that represent different physical phenomena are solved
simultaneously. However,
these equations often exhibit different
nonlinear characteristics and interdependencies, which can complicate
their resolution as a unified system of equations. The solution of large
sparse linear systems can be widely found in the CFD. In the finite vol-
ume method (FVM), the solution for the fluid transport lies in the large
sparse linear systems. Two main properties can be observed of the to be
solved square matrix: (a) the diagonal elements consistently align with
non-null elements and (b) the sparsity pattern displays symmetry. In
realistic cases, the matrixes are often so large that they require large-
scale distributed parallel computing to obtain the solution of interest
in a reasonable time. The use of GPU in CFD is noteworthy because it
significantly improves performance, reduces computation time, and
efficiently handles large datasets. AmgX is a library developed by NVI-
DIA designed for solving large sparse linear systems using various iter-
ative methods. The AmgX library offers seamless GPU acceleration for
distributed algebraic multigrid (AMG) and preconditioned iterative
methods [193]. It implements both classical and aggregation-based
AMG techniques, featuring various selector and interpolation strate-
gies, as well as a range of smoothers and preconditioners, including
block-Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and incomplete-LU factorization. The li-
brary includes standard and flexible preconditioned Krylov subspace
iterative methods, which can be paired with any available multigrid
methods or simpler preconditioners. The parallelism in the aggregation
scheme uses parallel graph matching techniques, while the smoothers
and preconditioners often utilize parallel graph colouring algorithms.
The AMG algorithm in the AmgX library achieves a speedup of 2â5 times
on a single GPU compared to a competitive CPU implementation. Pis-
caglia et al. [194] developed the amgx4Foam library, which connects
the open-source AmgX library to OpenFOAM. The library accelerated
the computationally intensive linear solver phase of simulations on
GPUs.

The challenges of post-processing large-scale datasets generated by
CFD-DEM simulations can also be addressed potentially using GPU
technology. Modelling large-scale systems with polydisperse particles
and the effects of particle shape and breakage on compaction needs to be
conducted. More attention should be paid to extending the existing
solver to couple with mass, momentum, energy, and species couplings
[178â180,184]. In recent years, advancements in computing hardware

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience109(2025)10122116

S. Wang and Y. Shen

have shifted their focus from exponential growth to increasing paral-
lelism, primarily by augmenting the number of processing cores. This
shift prioritizes enhanced performance over raw clock speed or in-
structions per cycle. Consequently, it is important to emphasize that
relying solely on hardware advancements does not necessarily make it
more feasible to simulate longer timespans. Instead, such improvements
primarily enhance the ability to handle larger systems. To achieve both
large-scale simulations and extended timescales, advanced numerical
acceleration techniques are essential.

2.4.2. Numerical acceleration technique

(i) Coarse-grained method

The coarse-grained method (CGM) employs the concept that multi-
ple real particles sharing identical properties (such as velocity, tem-

perature, and species) are lumped into a numerical parcel. This lumping
approach effectively reduces computational costs by decreasing the
overall particle number. The CGM employed some basic assumptions
(Fig. 10(a)) in equations including mass, momentum, species, and
collision parameters [195]:

where W is the statistic weight, representing the number of real particles
in a numerical parcel. For particle-fluid coarsening, no additional
modelling specific to particle-fluid interactions is required. During
coupling, parameters such as mass, momentum, species, and collision
properties are scaled based on the coarse-grained ratio, as detailed in
Eqs. 43â47. This scaling ensures the preservation of the systemâs
macroscopic behaviour, even as individual particle details are averaged.
The computational costs of the CGM exhibit a substantial reduction
when compared to the conventional CFD-DEM method (Fig. 10(b and
c)). Utilizing a coarse-grained ratio of 2 (i.e., W = 8), the CGM achieves
reductions of 86.5 % and 87.1 % in computational costs for cold flow
and heat transfer scenarios in fluidized beds, respectively. Furthermore,
in the simulation of biomass gasification within a 3D BFB gasifier,
employing 64 CPU cores for a physical time of 20 s, the CGM yields
computational times of approximately 18 days for a coarse-grained ratio
of 2, and 5 days for a coarse-grained ratio of 3 (i.e., W = 27) [10]. These
results highlight the significant improvement in numerical efficiency
achieved by the CGM in the CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid
reacting flow. It is noted that the choice of a suitable coarse-grained
ratio is crucial for managing the loss of resolution. The tests are rec-
ommended to be conducted before the simulation to determine the
optimal coarse-grained ratio, as it varies with the simulation scale. For
industrial-scale problems, a larger coarse-grained ratio is practical,
significantly reducing computational costs. In contrast, for lab-scale
studies where higher resolution is critical, a smaller coarse-grained
ratio is advisable to ensure accuracy, depending on the total number
of particles involved. Various scaling methods, such as multiphase
particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) and the parcel model, offer different ap-
proaches for coarse-grained operation. MP-PIC combines particles into
parcels within an Eulerian fluid grid, making it well-suited for dense
gas-solid flow-like fluidized beds
It effectively captures
particle-fluid interactions but may require parameter tuning. The parcel
model groups similar particles into parcels, significantly reducing the
number of tracked particles [197]. While commonly used in sprays and
combustion systems, it may lose accuracy if the properties of particles
within a parcel vary widely. The choice of scaling method depends on
the specific application: MP-PIC is ideal for dense particle-fluid dy-
namics, while the parcel model excels in scenarios where particles can
be grouped with minimal detail loss. General coarse-grained operation
strikes a balance but requires careful coarse-grained ratio selection to
preserve fine-scale behaviour.

[196].

Similar to the CGM, a process scaling approach aims to reduce
computational costs by changing process parameters, which has been
recently used in simulating ironmaking blast furnaces [147]. The pro-
cess scaling method primarily involves virtual augmentation of the
discharge rate while maintaining macroscopic heat and mass balance.
By employing this approach, a substantial reduction in computational
time, approximately two orders of magnitude, can be attained without
compromising the fidelity of the original physical process representa-
tion. Technically, as presented in Table S8 of Supplementary Materials,
to reduce the computational time, the mass flow rate in the scaled sys-
tem (Qp,s) is adjusted as scaling factor Î³ times (Qp,s = Î³Qp,o) of that in the
original system (Qp,o). Thus, solid particles move faster (Vp,s = Î³Vp,o) and
the residence time is reduced by Î³ times. Besides, other parameters (e.g.,
heat capacity, and source terms) are also mutually adjusted by the
process scaling factor as a similar treatment. Therefore, the physical
time of the real process is Î³ times the simulation time. By examining the
scaling factor for gas-solid flow, heat transfer, and chemical reactions,
the study determined that these processes yielded similar results with
varying scaling factors, up to 200. However, it was estimated that a
maximum process scaling factor of 406 should be imposed to prevent
unrealistic discharging rates.

To summarize, the CGM provides a natural idea to reduce compu-
tational costs by reducing particle numbers via the package assumption.
However, the coarse-grained level suitable for the CGM modelling of
dense gas-solid reacting flow is still an open question. The coarse-
grained level should be chosen based on the available computational
resources and successful resolution of key structures like bubbles and
clusters in fluidized beds [197]. Recently, the coarse-grained ratio is also
recommended to be smaller than 5 to capture the relevant physics of the
coating process via the comprehensive assessment of the impacts of
coarse-grained level on heat and mass transfer of the coating process
[198], which is also applicable for cohesive particles [199]. A higher
coarse-grained level needed coarser grids due to the intrinsic limitation
of the CFD-DEM method, making the lower resolution of the gas phase
and the inaccurate prediction of inter-phase interactions [10]. Besides,
coarser grids lose the heterogeneous structures of dense gas-solid flow.
Thus, the statistical kernel method (or diffusion-based method) is rec-
ommended to couple with the CGM to allow fine grids to resolve fluid
fields at high coarse-grained levels. The improved numerical efficiency
of the CGM arises from the reduction in the number of equations to be
numerically solved as the particle count decreases. This reduction en-
ables the modelling of short-term processes, even for industrial-scale
problems. However, the situation differs significantly for long-lasting
processes, particularly those occurring in highly dynamic environ-
ments. In such cases, the sheer magnitude of required time steps renders
numerical
integration impractical. Time-scale simulation remains
limited in capturing all relevant collision dynamics mathematically,
resulting in the inaccessibility of slow processes that span hours in
large-scale fluidized beds [200]. Compared with the wide application of
the CGM, the process scaling method is only used by several researchers
[147]. The method is constrained by several assumptions, which restrict
its applicability to simulating chemical engineering processes that
exhibit a near quasi-steady state, such as an ironmaking blast furnace.
However, there is a need to extend the application of this method to
transient processes. Further research is required to validate and adapt
the method for a wider range of processes, considering their dynamic
and transient nature.

(ii) Recurrence CFD method

To address the limitations of the CGM, a novel approach termed
Recurrence CFD (rCFD) was proposed for pseudo-periodic flows. This
method enables the modelling of long-term processes in massively large
systems, specifically chemical species conversions. By determining the
recurrence properties of the system and assessing the similarity between
states, the periodicity parameters can be established. The fundamental
concept of rCFD is summarized as follows.

A comprehensive CFD simulation of the target process was con-
ducted until the flow attained a state of pseudo-periodicity (refer to Box
A in Fig. 11). In this context, pseudo-periodic flows were characterized
as flows that exhibit irregular fluctuations around a mean steady state.
Subsequently, a set of three-dimensional flow fields Nrec, obtained at
equidistant time intervals of Îtrec within a monitoring interval of Ïrec,
were recorded. These data fields were then subjected to a recurrence
analysis utilizing a recurrence norm, which provided an evaluation for
each pair of flow fields and generated a recurrence matrix (refer to Box
B). The off-diagonal elements of the recurrence matrix served as in-
dicators of similarity between the paired flow fields. Utilizing this in-
formation, a recurrence process was initiated to construct an artificial
flow candidate by appropriately connecting flow sequences (refer to Box
C). The recurrence matrix facilitated the identification of a suitable
starting frame for a sequence, with a low pairwise recurrence norm, that
aligned with the ending frame of the preceding sequence. Passive scalars
were then traced on this constructed flow candidate using methods such
as solving transport equations or evaluating particle trajectories (refer to
Box D). The flow-based implementation of rCFD has been successfully
employed in various applications such as passive species transport

within an oscillating bubble column [201], decarbonization process in a
bubble-stirred steelmaking converter, heat transfer in fluidized beds
[201], and particle coating in fluidized beds [202]. In each of these
cases, the flow-based rCFD simulations produced results that closely
matched those obtained from full CFD simulations with a significant
improvement in simulation efficiency, typically by two to three orders of
magnitude.

A recent development in rCFD is the transport-based version that
focuses on the movement of inertia-less fluid tracers [203]. Unlike the
Eulerian flow-field approach, this approach employs a Lagrangian
perspective to address recurring transport processes rather than building
a generic flow field as a basis for transport. By projecting the Lagrangian
information onto the corresponding grid cells, the recurring flow pat-
terns can be represented as recurring patterns of memory re-distribution
(refer to Box E). When tracing a passive scalar, it is only necessary to
transfer the scalar information from the corresponding starting point to
the receiving cells of the Lagrangian trajectories (refer to Box F). The
preservation of mass and species conservation is a crucial concern in
rCFD. To mitigate
alternative
inherent
transport-based version of rCFD was introduced [204] (refer to Box G).
Unlike flow-based rCFD, the transport-based approach directly tackles
transport processes by defining specific cell shift operations without
generating a flow candidate. This bypassing of flow field calculation
significantly enhances the computational efficiency of transport-based
rCFD, enabling real-time predictions of passive transport in many in-
stances [203,205].

limitation,

this

an

In the framework of flow-based rCFD, the speed-ups are in the order
of 2â3 magnitudes [203]. A speed-up of 91 is achieved for the
single-phase example and a speed-up of 300 is reached for the fluidized
bed heat transfer example [201]. A remarkable increase in speed-up for
flow-based rCFD simulations of spouted bed particle coating, amounting
to 500 in total [202]. The transport-based rCFD takes the computational
efficiency to a new level by a further two orders of magnitude.
Compared to full simulations, this results in astounding speed-ups
ranging from 19,000 to 53,000 for single-phase examples and a
speed-up of 29,000 to 381,000 for fluidized bed heat transfer examples.
Ultimately, the simulations can clock in even faster than real-time, with
a mere 10 s needed to simulate a 5 min process while maintaining the
fine grid resolution of 650,000 grid cells [203].

The utilization of rCFD in practical applications is subject to certain
limitations. Primarily, this approach of time-extrapolation is applicable
exclusively to pseudo-periodic processes, characterized by recurring
flow features. These recurrent flow features must exhibit significant
prominence, such that distinct flow patterns can be effectively discerned
from others using an appropriate recurrence Norm (rNorm) [203]. The
first limitation of rCFD lies in its inability to capture unsteady spin-up
processes. However, it is possible to switch between different recur-
rent states characterized by their recurrence statistics, albeit with errors
for further
the switching time. There is potential
occurring at

exploration of interpolation techniques between two recurrent states.
The second limitation regarding the passive nature of transported
quantities in rCFD. For instance, when considering the dissolved
hydrogen concentration, the influence of a varying gas density on local
heat transfer should account for the drifting gas temperature. None-
theless, the governing flow topology, as described by the recurrence
statistics, remains unaffected. If a transported quantity is assumed to
have a significant impact on the underlying flow topology, it becomes
necessary to restart full CFD-DEM simulations and subsequently assess
new recurrence statistics. Fortunately, transitioning from rCFD back to
full simulations can be achieved smoothly through a straightforward
conversion procedure on a shared grid. In the transport-based rCFD
method, the modelling of diffusive transport is rather vague. The
physical diffusion is only accounted for by a one-step cell-to-cell inter-
change operator, which also serves as a controller for ensuring global
balance. As a result, the application scope of transport-based rCFD is
limited to convection-dominated transport processes [203].

Future research efforts should aim to achieve a more comprehensive
treatment of diffusion within the transport-based rCFD framework.
Additionally, the significant amount of data required to describe the
recurrence frames (i.e., the sum of shift operations on a high-resolution
grid) imposes practical limits on the number of recurrence frames that
can be loaded into memory. In scenarios involving unsteady flows with
highly disparate timescales, these limitations may constrain the utility of
rCFD simulations [203].

(iii) Machine learning method

Recent advances in computing hardware have shifted from expo-
nential growth in clock speed and instructions per cycle to enhancing
parallelism through more processing cores. As a result, relying solely on
hardware improvements to cover longer timespans is no longer viable.
Instead, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data
science are driving a transformative paradigm. ML, particularly deep
learning and physics-informed ML complements traditional methods by
uncovering latent patterns and mechanisms in datasets, advancing
predictive models for multiphase flows and reactors. Its applications
span hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and reactions in single-
phase and multiphase systems [206]. In chemical engineering, ML
shows promise for predicting outcomes and accelerating computations
in areas such as multiphase flow [207], granular behaviours [208,209],
and chemical reactions [210]. These advancements are achieved
through (i) pure ML-based surrogate modelling of governing equations,
(ii) data-driven and physics-informed closures for coarse simulations,
and (iii) knowledge-informed ML methods for solving conservation
equations.

In the first approach, a pure ML model is employed as an approx-
imator to replace full simulations. One illustrative example within this
category involves utilizing a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to

learn and approximate time series data representing fluid flow struc-
tures. This âblack-boxâ method offers improved efficiency compared to
computationally expensive iterative processes. Traditional solution
methods for governing equations, such as finite difference and finite
element methods, rely on grid resolution and time step constraints,
leading to limited computational speed and numerical stability. By
contrast, the ML approach alleviates these limitations. One main
drawback of a pure ML model is its limited extrapolation and inter-
pretability due to the absence of underlying domain knowledge. Thus,
when using pure ML methods, one must exercise significant caution and
focus on the modelâs generalization performance to ensure that it re-
mains valid beyond the original training data set. While employing a
pure ML approach for data-driven surrogate modelling of governing
equations can be highly efficient, its generalization ability remains an
ongoing area of study [206].

The obtained closures can be directly integrated into CFD solvers to
enhance coarse simulations, such as Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
(RANS) or CFD-DEM models. A study showed that coarse-grid CFD-ANN
simulations were about 10 % slower than traditional coarse-grid CFD
models due to the overhead of invoking a data loader at each time step
[211]. While this additional cost is minor, integrating data-driven
models introduces challenges, as they may rely on different ML plat-
forms, potentially limiting universality. Another approach involves
using ML to accelerate DEM simulations by directly computing
particle-particle and particle-boundary interactions, addressing the high
computational cost of collision detection, which limits DEMâs applica-
bility. To address this limitation, a convolutional neural network (CNN)
model was developed using DEM simulation data of granular flow,
incorporating a multiscale loss function to reduce training fluctuations
and achieve significant computational speed-ups [208]. Similarly, a
CNN-LSTM method was developed to study fluidized bed mixing and
segregation, based on CFD-DEM simulation data [212]. The CNN-LSTM
model outperformed LSTM in accuracy and efficiency, reducing
computation time by 90%â95 % compared to CFD-DEM simulations.
These coarse simulation approaches provide a much faster alternative to
highly resolved simulations while meeting the rapid turnaround re-
quirements of engineering decisions. Despite significant cost reductions,
coarse simulations still demand considerable resources for large-scale
flow devices. For example, in industrial fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)
(cid:0) 3 m are computationally
riser reactors, mesh resolutions around 10
prohibitive for reactor scales of 100â101 m. Tracking particle dynamics
with DEM or coarse DEM further increases costs, as these reactors
contain 1012 to 1014 particles. Addressing these challenges requires new
paradigms. To this end, researchers have applied knowledge-informed
ML techniques to accelerate Eulerian fluid and Lagrangian particle dy-
namics simulations. Notably, a ML-based regression forest method was
proposed to estimate particle movement with larger time steps in
smooth particle hydrodynamics, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy
[213].

To improve generalization and reliably predict particle positions and
velocities, a feature vector was designed to model forces and constraints
from governing equations. This approach quickly approximates a par-
ticleâs next position and velocity based on neighbouring states but is less
applicable to Euler fluid simulations. To address this, a CNN was trained
offline to solve the Poisson equation, replacing the preconditioned
conjugate gradient solver in the pressure projection step of Euler sim-
ulations [214]. This unsupervised method efficiently solved large sparse
systems in the incompressible Euler equations using operator splitting,
demonstrating superior
real-time performance and generalization
compared to recent data-driven approaches. However, coarse-grid sim-
ulations with ML-based closures remain more efficient, as these closures
integrate seamlessly into CFD solvers. This highlights the need for
further
conservation
equations.

exploration of ML-informed solutions

for

In addition to the aforementioned acceleration methods for CFD-
DEM simulations of dense gas-solid flows, there are also approaches

aimed at speeding up the computation of chemical reactions, such as the
operator-splitting approach and in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT)
method [215,216]. Specifically, the operator-splitting approach is a
numerical technique widely used to simplify the simulation of coupled
processes, such as chemical reactions and fluid flow. By decoupling the
system into separate subproblems (e.g., reaction and transport), each
can be solved individually using specialized methods,
reducing
computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. This method is
particularly effective for CFD-DEM simulations involving stiff reaction
kinetics, as it allows for efficient integration of the reaction rates without
being constrained by the time step of the flow solver. The ISAT method is
an advanced technique designed to further accelerate simulations by
reducing the computational burden associated with solving complex
chemical reaction kinetics. ISAT works by storing previously computed
solutions to reaction rate equations in a lookup table. During subsequent
computations, if a new query falls within a pre-defined error tolerance of
an existing entry, the stored solution is retrieved instead of recalculating
it. This adaptive approach significantly enhances computational effi-
ciency while maintaining accuracy, making it particularly useful for
multi-phase flow simulations with detailed reaction mechanisms.

3. Recent advances and applications

This section provides a review of recent advancements and appli-
cations of CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid reacting systems
within various chemical engineering processes. These processes include
the thermochemical conversion of solid fuels, blast furnace ironmaking,
chemical looping combustion, fluid catalytic cracking, incineration and
calcination, as well as other industrial processes such as coating and
leaching, silicon production,
tungsten oxide reduction, and solid
melting. The review focuses on the utilization of numerical methods and
simulation platforms discussed earlier.

3.1. Thermochemical conversion of solid fuels

The thermochemical conversion of solid fuels, such as biomass and
coal, involves drying, pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion (Fig. 12),

combined with pyrolysis in CFD-DEM simulations [34,35,161,218].
During pyrolysis, biomass decomposes into char, tar, and volatiles. The
resulting char undergoes gasification, reacting with agents like CO2,
CH4, and H2O to produce syngas (CO and H2), or oxidizes with O2 into
CO and CO2 during combustion, which occurs above 700
C [219].
Gasification and combustion are slower processes compared to pyrolysis
[217]. Homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions between particles
and surrounding gases significantly influence gas product yields and
carbon conversion efficiency.

â¦

â¦

Homogeneous reactions, such as the combustion and reforming of
gaseous species (e.g., O2 or H2O) with volatiles (e.g., CH4, CO, H2), play
a critical role in the gasification and combustion of high-volatile solid
fuels like biomass and low-rank coal [220,221]. These reactions involve
complex elementary mechanisms [158] but are often simplified as
global reactions in CFD-DEM simulations to reduce computational costs.
The rates of homogeneous reactions depend on species concentrations,
which vary significantly between the dense and bubble phases due to
radical quenching in the dense phase. This disparity affects volatile
oxidation, as experimental studies show that volatile combustion is
confined to bubbles in fluidized bed reactors [222]. However, this
phenomenon is underrepresented in CFD simulations, with Liu et al.
[115] being one of the few to note that the local source of homogeneous
reactions fluctuates with gas void fraction, underscoring the link be-
tween gas reactions and bubble dynamics. Significant efforts have been
made to determine the kinetics of homogeneous reactions, with the
primary reaction rates and expressions detailed in Table S9 of the

Supplementary Materials [158]. The Arrhenius expression remains the
most widely used model for reaction rates [33â35,115,121,143,160]. To
ensure accurate simulations, a selection criterion for homogeneous ki-
netics is often employed, particularly for critical reactions like CO and
H2 oxidation, as the choice of kinetics can greatly influence outcomes
[158]. Conversely, the water-gas shift reaction typically uses a consis-
tent expression and has a more pronounced effect on product gas
composition than the oxidation of H2 and CO. In fluidized bed reactors,
methane steam reforming is kinetically slow, rendering the choice of
kinetics less impactful. However, the presence of materials such as ash,
char, catalysts, and sand in the bed notably affects the combustion and
reforming of gaseous species [223â225]. The following section will
explore the inhibitory effects of sand on char combustion in fluidized
bed reactors.

The gasification of the char involves three main heterogeneous

reactions:

Boudouard reaction: C + CO2 â 2CO

Water-gas reaction: C + H2O â CO + H2

Methanation reaction: C + 2H2 â CH4

(R1)

(R2)

(R3)

In air or oxygen gasifiers, the Boudouard reaction (R1) dominates, while
the water-gas reaction (R2) governs in steam gasifiers. The rates of
gasification reactions are influenced by material properties and oper-
ating conditions [226]. Current char conversion models determine the
overall rate by incorporating both kinetic and diffusion rates. The
diffusion rate reflects the gradual transport of gasifying agents from the
charâs outer surface to its inner regions, while the kinetic rate accounts
for the faster reactions occurring mainly on the outer surface. A
commonly adopted approach in CFD-DEM simulations of biomass gasi-
fication is the kinetic/diffusion-limited rate model [227], as employed
in previous studies [35,37,228]:

Therefore, Eq. (48) becomes diffusion-controlled during the char gasi-
fication process, particularly when the char particle size (dp) exceeds 1.0
mm and the temperature (Tp) exceeds 800 K [228]. Researchers have put
forth various gas-film models to elucidate the char conversion process,
including single, double, and continuous film models [229â232]. These
diverse models can all be expressed through a unified global reaction,
characterized by a parameter denoted as Î¸ [233]:

where Î¸ = (2p+2)/(p+2) is the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio, representing the
composition of reaction products and calculated as a function of tem-
perature and other parameters [234]. The magnitude of Î¸ ranges from 1
(only CO2 as the product) to 2 (only CO as the product). The exact
proportion of these two gaseous species can be empirically determined
by an Arrhenius equation p = [CO]/[CO2] = A0exp(-B0/Tp) [235]. For a
particle with a diameter less than 50 Î¼m, A0 = 2500 and B0 = 6240
[234]. For larger particles (dp > 1 mm), the value of Î¸ is close to 1 [236].
Based on the experiments of char combustion in fluidized bed gasifiers, Î¸
ranges from 1.11 to 1.25 for lignite coal [237] and sewage sludge [238].
In the context of modelling char combustion in fluidized bed combus-
tors, the parameter Î¸ holds significant importance. It plays a primary
role and has a notable impact on the simulation results. In fluidized bed
gasifiers, the role of Î¸ is relatively minor and has only a slight impact on
the results [158]. This is because the gas products produced in gasifiers
are mainly affected by the water-gas shift reaction and char gasification,
rather than char combustion [221].

Unlike pulverized coal combustion boilers, where char particles burn
in isolation, fluidized bed reactors involve char combustion among
numerous moving bed materials. This process necessitates accounting
for the inhibitory effect of sand on char conversion in simulations [45].
CO formation mainly arises from char oxidation, but nearby sand par-
ticles suppress further CO oxidation [223â225]. At lower temperatures,
CO diffuses away from the carbon particle with minimal sand inhibition.
However, at higher temperatures, CO combusts near the carbon particle,
resulting in CO2 production [223â225]. The presence of inert particles
influences mass transfer by reducing available volume and altering
gas-phase flow dynamics around char particles. To account for these
effects, various empirical Sherwood number expressions have been
developed to quantify the ratio of convective to diffusive mass transfer
[223,239â241]. Geng and Che [45] incorporated Scalaâs Sherwood
number correlation incorporated the one proposed by Scala [241] into a
CFD-DEM framework, achieving accurate predictions aligned with
experimental data:

where Do and Rf are the mass diffusion coefficient and the universal gas

inhibitory effect has been incorporated into diffusion rate calculations
for char and propane combustion [115] and O2/CO2 char combustion
[242] in fluidized bed reactors. As shown in Fig. 13, CFD-DEM results
align well with experimental data [45]. Additionally, incorporating
polydispersity effects into the drag model further improves prediction

accuracy [90].

In recent years, extensive research has focused on applying the CFD-
DEM method to the thermochemical conversion of solid fuels. Fig. S2
and Table S10 of Supplementary Materials summarize typical simulation
results from the past decade. Thermochemical conversion processes,
including drying, pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion, play critical
roles in various industrial applications. The following sections highlight
key findings for each process.

3.1.1. Drying

Drying is broadly encountered in many industrial applications such
as food and wood processing. The drying process mainly takes place in
packed beds, rotating drums, and fluidized beds. From a technical
standpoint, integrating a species transport equation, specifically for
H2O, into the CFD-DEM framework is all that is required in addition to
the sub-models for flow dynamics and heat transfer. The drying process
of arabica coffee beans in a batch fluidized bed roaster was first studied
by the MultiFlow platform [243]. In addition to solving the gas phase
and solid phase at a fluid cell level and a particle-scale level, respec-
tively, the 1D temperature and moisture content profiles inside each
particle were solved at the sub-particle scale level. Thus, the information
on each particle was obtained including heat and mass transfer co-
efficients. The assumption of anisotropic transport was confirmed to
give a better prediction [244]. However, assumptions such as particle
anisotropy, material properties, and the neglect of particle shrinkage
have contributed to discrepancies in the results. Solving differential
equations for each particle is computationally intensive, making it a
time-consuming task. To address this, reduced-order models for
single-particle simulations have been developed, achieving solution
speeds approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the original
partial differential equations (PDEs). Although these findings are pre-
liminary and specific to a particular example, they demonstrate that
model reduction methods can significantly extend the applicability of
CFD-DEM approaches by substantially reducing computation times
[245].

A numerical investigation was conducted to study the drying process
in a packed bed reactor [246]. The flow passing through the packed bed
was modelled using a porous media concept, considering thermochem-
ical interactions between the gas and solid phases. In a separate study,
the drying process of moving particles in a rotating drum was analyzed
by Mohseni and Peters [171], highlighting the higher drying rate
observed in agitated apparatuses compared to motionless beds such as
fixed beds [244]. As shown in Fig. 14, the prediction outcomes for a

single particle demonstrate excellent agreement with the experimental
data, particularly regarding the particle centre temperature, drying rate,
and moisture content. The findings indicate that smaller-sized particles
exhibit a higher critical dry ing rate and heating rate, attributed to
reduced conductive and radiative heat transfer. Moreover, reducing the
particle diameter enhances convective heat transfer and drying rate,
leading to a more efficient system. In contrast, larger particles necessi-
tate a longer duration to propagate the drying front from the surface to
the core and achieve the gas temperature. Furthermore, the utilization of
L-shaped baffles in a baffled laboratory rotary dryer for convective
drying of wood chips resulted in a higher drying rate compared to
straight baffles, as observed in a study on the influence of baffle
configuration [245].

A drying analysis for biomass in a vibrating fluidized bed dryer was
conducted subsequently [247]. Increasing the gas temperature and inlet
gas velocity improved the drying rate but reduced the final moisture
content, a finding supported by studies conducted by other researchers
[248] who investigated the drying process in fluidized beds using an
established drying model considering water evaporation. Another study
demonstrated that increasing the inlet gas velocity increased the particle
Reynolds number (Rep), particle Nusselt number (Nup), and particle
Sherwood number (Shp), thereby enhancing heat and mass transfer and
facilitating the drying process [41]. A controlling parameter, defined as
the ratio of the liquid bridge force to other forces, was found to be
greater than unity in the dense region and 15 % in the emulsion phase
[249]. This observation indicated that reducing the percentage of the
emulsion phase effectively improved the heat and mass transfer prop-
erties. The introduction of pulsed gas was found to control flow regimes
and reduce unfavourable mesoscale structures, potentially regulating
the thermochemical characteristics.

Particles with higher initial moisture content required longer drying
times, while smaller particles dried faster due to more efficient
convective and conductive heat transfer. The increased specific surface
area of smaller particles enhances convective heat transfer, while faster
conductive heat transfer occurs from the surface to the particle centroid
[159]. Additionally, lower gas temperatures and higher inlet gas ve-
locities improve drying product quality and particle size uniformity by
reducing fluctuations in moisture and diameter distribution [159].
Azmir et al. [250] found that convective heat transfer dominated drying
in a fluidized bed, with conductive heat transfer becoming significant at
lower inlet gas velocities. Earlier studies assumed that low moisture
content did not affect particle collision processes. Recently, a liquid

cohesion effects due to high moisture content in fluidized beds, showing
that larger gas-solid momentum exchanges accelerate drying rates of
wet particles [41]. In a study of pharmaceutical wet granules drying in a
fluidized bed, a novel model was proposed that included water evapo-
ration and cohesion forces from liquid bridges between particles, high-
lighting significant differences in dynamics and temperature increase

rates between wet and dry particles [251]. The drying rate increased
with higher inlet air velocity and temperature. Additionally, GPU-based
CFD-DEM simulations demonstrated improved numerical efficiency in
predicting particle temperature rise and mass loss compared to
CPU-based solvers [178].

A recent study integrated the immersed boundary method (IBM)

with CFD-DEM to simulate particle drying and address the no-slip
boundary condition of the gas phase in complex geometries [252]. As
shown in Fig. 15, STL format files described the immersed interface,
while Cartesian grids represented the simulation domain. Cell classifi-
cation into fluid or solid phases was based on their central positions. The
IBM method was extended to handle mass transfer and implement
boundary conditions for species transport equations. The model was
validated with a relative error of less than 8 %, and considering Stefan
flow in the drag correlation had no significant effect on the particle
drying process.

3.1.2. Pyrolysis

Biofuels derived from pyrolysis are gaining recognition as a prom-
ising alternative to fossil fuels due to their sustainability, carbon
neutrality, and economic viability. The pyrolysis process is commonly
carried out in various types of fluidized bed reactors [253]. In recent
years, several reaction kinetics models have been proposed [254]. The
simplest approach is the single component single step kinetics (SCSS),
which treats biomass as a single component and assumes its conversion
to char, oil, and syngas occurs in a single reaction step. This simplifies
the complexity of the feedstock. The single-component multi-step ki-
netics (SCMS) model extends this by considering secondary cracking
reactions of bio-oil, specifically tar vapour [255] (Fig. 16). During the
pyrolysis process, biomass particles are thermally activated and undergo
decomposition, resulting in the formation of char, syngas, and tar
vapour. The tar vapour can further undergo secondary cracking, leading
to the production of additional syngas. Solid biomass is composed of
three main components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. To
consider the effects of different biopolymer compositions in the feed-
stock, multi-component single step (MCSS) kinetic schemes use different
reaction rate expressions for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin [156].
The multi-component multi-step (MCMS) kinetics further considers
secondary tar cracking [256,257], which is one of the most advanced
and accurate models used to simulate the pyrolysis process, particularly
for biomass. It builds on simpler models like SCSS and SCMS by intro-
ducing several key improvements that allow for a more detailed and
reactions
representative understanding of
involved. Unlike simpler models that treat biomass as a uniform mate-
rial, the MCMS model acknowledges that biomass consists of multiple
distinct components. Specifically, it considers three major biopolymers
in solid biomass: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Each of these
components has different thermal properties and reaction rates during
pyrolysis, which must be accounted for to accurately model the
decomposition process [258]. The multi-step aspect of the model adds
complexity by including not just primary reactions (such as the
decomposition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin into char, syngas,
and tar), but also secondary reactions. In particular, it models the pri-
mary decomposition reactions and secondary cracking reactions. By
accounting for these multiple steps, the MCMS model provides a more
detailed picture of how the biomass breaks down and how secondary
reactions influence product distribution [259]. The advantages of the
MCMS model lie in greater accuracy, detailed representation of biomass,

the complex chemical

and improved predictions for industrial applications [260]. The chal-
lenges in implementing the MCMS model are computational complexity,
experimental data requirements for each component and reaction step,
and model integration for fine-tuning and validation against experi-
mental results [256]. To summarize, the MCMS model is a sophisticated
and highly accurate tool for simulating the pyrolysis process. It provides
detailed insights into the thermal decomposition of biomass and helps
its
optimize pyrolysis systems for biofuel production. However,
complexity and computational demands must be carefully managed
when applying it in CFD-DEM simulations [261]. Among the above-
mentioned pyrolysis models, the SCMS kinetic scheme is the most used
one due to its easiest implementation.

Via studying the effects of operating parameters on fast pyrolysis in
fluidized bed reactors, some researchers demonstrated that the impact of
superficial gas velocity on final bio-oil yields was more significant
compared to the influence of particle moisture content [156] and the
different shrinking patterns remarkably affected the entrainment char-
acteristics but had a minor effect on product yields [255]. The
entrainment velocity had a linear relationship with the particle diameter
after pyrolysis. The size-induced and density-induced segregation of
biomass particles in such a polydisperse system resulted in different
residence time distributions (RTDs) in the freeboard and dense region by
using the constant density shrinkage pattern and constant size shrinkage
pattern. Convective heat transfer was found to contribute twice as much
as conductive heat transfer in the overall heat transfer process. A ther-
mally thick particle model with the CFD-DEM method was used to
simulate biomass pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor [118], which is
applicable for modelling large-size biomass particles. In this context, the
temperature gradient leads to distinct thermochemical conversion states
in different parts of the particle. Moreover, interphase coupling was
crucial for the formation of sand particle clusters in a turbulent riser
[262]. These clusters were found to generate and sustain gas turbulence,
as well as transport biomass particles. Neglecting the heterogeneity
induced by these clusters resulted in a maximum over-prediction of
syngas yield by 33 %. Furthermore, 2D simulations tended to over-
estimate the level of clustering, leading to an under-prediction of both
syngas and tar yields. Recently, a coarse-grained CFD-DEM method was
extended to incorporate particle-resolved simulation to study biomass
fast pyrolysis [263], which bridges the gap between particle-scale and
reactor-scale simulations (Fig. 17). The heat transfer and reaction ki-
netics in the system were accurately calibrated through particle-resolved
simulations. A hybrid drag model was employed to differentiate the
fluidization patterns of biomass and sand particles, which arise from
their distinct sizes and densities. This approach allowed for a more
precise characterization of the behavior of the different particle types in
system. A diffusion-based method was further implemented on the
coarse-grained CFD-DEM framework in conjunction with the MCSS ki-
netic scheme to smooth the particle concentration when the particle
diameter approached the grid size [264]. The findings revealed that the
largest bubble equivalent diameter was observed at the same height in
all reactor configurations, with the square reactor exhibiting slightly
smaller bubbles compared to the rectangular reactor. Moreover,

reducing the gas inlet area resulted in more frequent occurrence of large
bubbles and an increase in fluctuation frequency within the reactor
system.

In a subsequent study, the MCMS kinetic scheme, originally proposed
by Debiagi et al. [265], which encompasses 32 chemical reactions and
59 species, was applied to examine the impact of biomass components
on product formation within a 3D BFB reactor [256]. This reaction
scheme provides two significant advancements: (i) it allows for the
practical evaluation of product variations under different operating
conditions, and (ii) it enables the prediction of detailed species
composition
in
gas-liquid-solid products. The presence of carbon-rich lignin and tannin
pseudo-species within the reaction scheme was found to have a notable
positive impact on the bio-char yield. On the other hand, the formation
of bio-oil and bio-gas was correlated with the presence of oxygen-rich
lignin pseudo-species. The pyrolysis temperature had a positive influ-
ence on the product yields [266]. The test particle size (<1 mm) showed
a significant impact on the flow patterns but an insignificant impact on
the product yields [267].

To simulate fast biomass pyrolysis using the MCMS kinetic scheme in
a double-auger reactor, an adaptive time-step algorithm coupled the
ODE and DEM solvers and showed the reaction to be heat-transfer
limited for particles >2 mm [257]. Based on the structural optimiza-
tion of baffle internals in a downer reactor for the fast pyrolysis of coal,
the presence of baffles was found to enhance the degree of particle
mixing and the mean residence time of coal particles [268]. Further-
more, a three-step reduction approach was implemented to convert the
comprehensive cracking scheme into a reduced scheme [269]. The pri-
mary and secondary pyrolysis schemes were implemented with the
terminal species of the primary pyrolysis scheme serving as the starting
reactants for the secondary pyrolysis step. The original database of
secondary pyrolysis scheme with 509 species and 20240 reactions was
reduced following three criteria: (i) removing reactions involving
radical species; (ii) removing three-body and falloff reactions; (iii)

removing reactions with reactants that are not present in the system. The
final reduced secondary pyrolysis scheme with 59 species and 66 re-
actions was used in the simulation. The reduction of the secondary re-
action scheme was found to insignificantly influence the overall yields of
switchgrass pyrolysis, as compared to the full secondary scheme.

The recycling of solid waste, such as e-waste, solar panel waste, and
fan blade waste, has become a major focus in both academic and engi-
neering fields [270]. For instance, by the end of 2020, global solar panel
capacity surpassed 700 GW, with solar panels typically having a lifespan
of around 25 years [271]. Consequently, the end-of-life solar panel
waste is projected to reach 1.7â8 million tonnes (18 GW) by 2030 and
60â78 million tonnes (630 GW) [272]. Numerous e-waste recycling
technologies have been developed, varying in complexity, energy usage,
material consumption, and recycling efficiency [271,273,274]. Unlike
landfilling, which leads to a permanent loss of resources and potential
environmental damage, recycling offers the advantage of recovering
high-purity materials for reuse, making it the preferred option [275,
276]. This principle also applies to solar panel waste recycling, which
involves two key steps [277]: i) delamination to separate glass, solar
cells, and backsheet; and ii) metal recovery, particularly for valuable
metals like silver and copper. Delamination can be achieved through
mechanical, thermal, or chemical methods, with thermal delamination
considered the most cost-effective and practical approach. During this
process, the encapsulating material, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), is
pyrolyzed, allowing for the separation of the glass and solar cells
(Fig. 18). Afterward, EVA is removed, and the remaining mixture of solid
cells, glass, and metallic components is further processed for separation.
A recent study assumed solar panel particles to be spherical and
isothermal, revealing higher EVA removal efficiency in bubbling fluid-
ized beds compared to fixed beds. This was explained by analyzing
particle-scale parameters like Reynolds and Nusselt numbers, shedding
light on particle dynamics and heat transfer [270]. However, particle
shape should be considered in most solid waste recycling simulations.
Various methods have been developed to represent non-spherical

particles, including the multi-sphere, real geometry, polyhedron, and
super-quadric models, as summarized in Section 2.1.3. A recent
CFD-DEM study using the super-quadric model explored the fluidization
of chip-like particles in a 3D BFB, finding that a larger aspect ratio (AR)
promotes better mixing, dispersion, and faster cooling [278]. The sub-
sequent study emphasized that convective heat transfer, particularly in
the dilute phase, drives the cooling process, providing valuable insights
for optimizing fluidized bed systems in applications like solar panel
recycling [279]. In the context of thermal delamination of solar panel
waste, a multi-sphere model that combines multiple super-quadric
particles into a multi-superquadric particle can be applied. However,
as noted in existing literature [280], the current multi-superquadric
model only allows for particle combinations but cannot separate them
during simulations, a critical feature for industrial processes like thermal
delamination. To advance the application of CFD-DEM methods in
modeling solid waste recycling,
to develop a
multi-superquadric model that enables the separation of glued particles
during simulations.

Particle shape exerts a substantial influence on the flow pattern and
subsequent biomass pyrolysis outcomes. When comparing a spherical
particle to a cylindrical one with the same equivalent volume, the cy-
lindrical particle boasts a larger surface area, thereby exhibiting supe-
rior heat transfer performance. Some researchers integrated a 1D model
into the CFD-DEM framework to simulate the fast pyrolysis of non-
spherical biomass particles in packed bed reactors, taking into account
intra-particle transport involving heat and mass transfer [58,59]. The
shape of the particles was represented using either a super-quadric
model [57] or a glued-sphere model [58,59] (Fig. 19). Various factors
were considered, including inter-phase convection, inter-particle con-
duction, intra-particle conduction, and heat of reaction [57]. Neglecting

the intra-particle effect was found to cause underestimation of reaction
rates, particularly for reactions that required a longer time to complete.

In addition to the fluidized bed, the rotary drum is also regarded as
an energy-intensive reactor for biomass pyrolysis [281]. The CFD-DEM
method was coupled with a 1D thermally thick model to account for
the thermal gradients within the particle. A diffusion-based voidage
algorithm was also implemented to achieve grid-independence results. A
three-parameter model was utilized to represent the volume change of
particles during the pyrolysis process. Higher rotating speeds or lower
filling levels were found to have a detrimental effect on biomass con-
version. A recent review has comprehensively examined the MFIX-based
multi-scale CFD simulations of biomass fast pyrolysis [63]. The recent
advancements in biomass pyrolysis were summarized as five key areas:
(i) detailed kinetics involving 32 reactions and 59 species, (ii) efficient
intra-particle models specifically designed for thermally thick particles,
(iii) hybrid drag models applicable to sand biomass and biochar, (iv)
convection heat transfer models suitable for non-spherical particles, (v)
shape-resolved models such as glued spheres and super-quadric parti-
cles, and (vi) machine learning derived models.

3.1.3. Gasification

In simulating the gasification process in a fluidized bed reactor, CFD-
DEM was coupled with thermochemical sub-models, including inter-
particle/-phase interactions, heat and mass transfer, radiation, particle
shrinkage, pyrolysis, and both homogeneous and heterogeneous re-
actions [35]. Higher temperatures enhanced endothermic reactions,
while a higher feed position led to lower carbon conversion [218].
Increasing the steam-to-biomass ratio raised H2 and CO2 concentrations

while reducing CO levels. Torrefied biomass requires a longer conver-
sion time than raw biomass [218]. Simplified reaction kinetics were
used to model glucose gasification in a supercritical water-fluidized bed
[282], showing that higher bed temperatures, increased bed height, and
reduced flow rates positively affected gasification, with gas release
having minimal impact on fluidization. Flow hydrodynamics is closely
linked to the thermochemical conversion in biomass gasification [283,
284]. A 3D fluidized bed reactor was simulated using the coarse-grained
CFD-DEM method,
incorporating non-spherical particle shapes in
interphase interactions [228]. Wood pellets were introduced after the
bed material reached a quasi-steady state, with inert residuals added

after 20 h and 50 h of operation. The simulation results aligned well with
experimental data. Buss et al. [285] applied the thermally thick
assumption to model transport in agitated fuel beds, demonstrating its
utility. The coarse-grained CFD-DEM method has been validated for
multi-physics processes,
including gas-solid hydrodynamics, heat
transfer, and reactions, showing accurate predictions of gasification
while significantly reducing computational costs [286]. Recently, CO2
gasification of carbon anodes was studied by coupling COMSOL and
YADE, using the thermally thick assumption to model particle shrinkage
and thermophysical properties [287].

Unlike commercial software, the open-source MFIX-DEM has been

successfully applied to simulate biomass gasification in fluidized bed
reactors,
integrating thermochemical sub-models [37,121,160,161,
263]. Sensitivity analysis showed that the non-linear Hertzian contact
model required 6.7 times more computation time than the LSD model,
with the LSD model providing comparable accuracy while significantly
reducing simulation time [37]. The choice of drag model influenced
gas-solid hydrodynamics but had minimal
impact on gas product
composition. Wang et al. [267] highlighted the critical role of particle
diameter in thermochemical characteristics, as reaction rates and
product yields depend heavily on particle temperature and heat transfer
modes (Fig. 20). Variations in particle size and density, driven by
chemical reactions, affect convection, conduction, radiation, and reac-
tion heat transfer, underscoring the strong relationship between ther-
mochemical properties and particle characteristics.

Examining the contribution of each heat transfer mode under
different operating conditions during biomass gasification in a BFB
reactor, it is found that convection played a dominant role in heat
transfer, followed by radiation and heat of reaction [288]. Conduction
accounted for the smallest proportion and could be disregarded in the
thermal analysis. A hybrid method combining the TFM and DEM was
developed to investigate the oxygen-enriched biomass gasification
process in a BFB reactor [289]. The bed material, consisting of
small-sized particles, was modelled using the TFM, while the biomass
particles were simulated using the DEM. The particle size distribution
(PSD) of the biomass particles exhibited a long tail in the upper bed
layer. Increasing the operating velocity enhanced the oxidation process

by promoting better mixing between the bed material and biomass
particles. The optimal fluidization number (FN) and equivalence ratios
(ER) were 3.56 and 0.3 respectively during the biomass gasification in a
BFB gasifier operated with air as the oxidizing agent [290]. Moreover,
the formation of nitrogen and sulphur contaminants (e.g., NH3, HCN,
H2S, COS, and SO2) during biomass gasification in a BFB gasifier was
studied in a recent work [291], which focused on the yield of deleterious
contaminants and their impact on the gasification process. The forma-
tion of NH3 was assumed to occur through a heterogeneous reaction that
also produced HCN. The formation of COS and SO2 was assumed to
follow a heterogeneous reaction producing H2S. In another study, the
pyrolysis and gasification sub-models were integrated into the CFD-DEM
methods to investigate the thermochemical conversion of wood chips in
a lab-scale BFB unit operated at the pyrolysis and gasification modes
[292]. The shrinkage core model was employed to account for various
factors affecting biomass gasification. Biomass pyrolysis resulted in a
syngas yield ranging from 0.65 to 0.66 while biomass gasification led to
the production of syngas with a yield of 1.73â1.77 Nm3 per kilogram of
fuel. The co-gasification of biomass and coal improved both hydrogen
efficiency and cold gas efficiency in a fluidized reactor [293]. A blend
ratio of 75 % biomass in the solid fuels was found to yield the lowest
concentrations of CO and CO2, while simultaneously achieving the
highest concentrations of H2 and CH4. This particular blend ratio opti-
mized the high calorific value, carbon conversion efficiency, and
hydrogen conversion efficiency. A recent study showed that the gas
back-mixing significantly dominated the combustion of volatile and the

gas back-mixing was remarkably influenced by sand particle size [255].
The fluctuation of the gasification rate was mainly caused by the hori-
zontal biomass particles mixing which was closely related to bubble
behaviours. By analyzing the bubble behaviours and thermochemical
characteristics of the dense gas-solid reacting flow in the fluidized bed
gasifier, a coarse-grained CFD-DEM simulation successfully obtained
particle-scale information such as velocity, Reynolds number, heat
transfer coefficient, and temperature of both sand and biomass particles
[10]. Using 64 CPU cores, the simulation of biomass gasification took
approximately 18 days and 5 days for the coarse-grained ratios of 2 and
3, respectively, considering a physical time of 20 s. These results
demonstrate
the
coarse-grained CFD-DEM method in simulating biomass gasification.
Recently, a novel approach was proposed by coupling the reduced-order
modelling with the coarse-grained CFD-DEM method to accelerate coal
gasifier simulation and optimization [294]. A quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) simulation was used as an accurate initial condition for the
real 3D simulation which resulted in a significant decrease in physical
time from several hours to minutes. The final syngas composition and
flow rates were highly influenced by the fuel or gasification agent rate
and process operating conditions. Based on their expertise and data from
small-scale systems, researchers [295] conducted a numerical study to
design a 22 MW updraft moving-bed coal gasifier for industrial-scale
application. To accomplish this,
they first conducted a quasi-1D
CFD-DEM simulation to obtain initial conditions for subsequent fully
3D coarse-grained CFD-DEM simulations. Under intermittent coal feed
conditions, the syngas components followed the same cycles. Further-
more, the shutdown process of the gasifier took over 4.4 h, while the
restoration of the system from a sudden bed material loss took more than
2 h to complete.

The behaviour of the bubble phase plays a critical role in the ther-
mochemical conversion of biomass in fluidized beds [284]. Fig. 21
shows the lateral elongation of small bubbles near the bedâs bottom
during gasification. The bubble phase exhibited higher reaction rates for
water-gas shift and methane steam reactions, with greater concentra-
tions of CH4, CO, CO2, and H2O compared to the emulsion phase.
Further studies [122] revealed that axial segregation of biomass

particles influenced chemical reactions, while increased temperature,
steam-to-biomass ratio, and equivalent ratio enhanced particle-scale
interactions for biomass and sand particles. Numerical simulations
[296,297] highlighted the bubble-to-emulsion phase mass transfer,
emphasizing that diffusion was more critical for clouded bubbles,
whereas convective transfer was driven by strong gas suction forces.
Non-uniform gas concentration was also affected by temperature vari-
ations within bubbles, and the interaction of vertically separated bub-
bles significantly boosted mass transfer in later stages due to the âsuction
effectâ from the upper bubble.

3.1.4. Combustion

â¦

Rong and Horio [143] developed a comprehensive CFD-DEM model
integrating thermochemical sub-models for heat/mass transfer, chemi-
cal reactions, and NO formation. This model was used to study
single-char combustion in a 2D BFB reactor with 20 char particles and
2000 inert sand particles. The char particles were assumed to have a
constant diameter, and five global heterogeneous and homogeneous
reactions were modelled using first-order Arrhenius kinetics. Tempera-
ture fluctuations of char particles were observed at 5 Hzâ7 Hz, with peak
temperatures approximately 50 Â± 5
C higher than the average bed
temperature. To enhance gas flow predictions, LES was coupled with
CFD-DEM to resolve turbulence [34], though limitations in resolving
Kolmogorov-scale turbulence were noted [298]. The study also
accounted for NOx formation but lacked detailed closure of filtered re-
action rates for LES modelling [151,299]. Similar findings indicated that
coal particle temperatures exceeded bed temperatures in BFB reactors
[45,115], with collision heat transfer contributing minimally to overall
power exchanges, including combustion, radiation, and convection. A
CFD-DEM simulation incorporating the inhibitory effect of sand on char
thermochemical conversion demonstrated good agreement with exper-
imental results [45]. Higher bed temperatures and increased oxygen
concentrations were found to enhance char combustion by improving
heat and mass transfer to char particles. However, another study re-
ported an unexpected finding where char combustion rates decreased
with increasing bed temperature [115], aligning with experimental
observations [300]. Gaseous species combustion was found to occur

predominantly in three distinct regions depending on bed temperature:
above the bed surface, within ascending bubbles, or in the emulsion
phase. These findings highlight the complex interaction between phys-
ical and chemical processes in fluidized bed combustion, underscoring
the need for advanced modeling to accurately capture such phenomena.
Char combustion in BFB reactors under O2/CO2 and O2/N2 atmo-
spheres showed minor differences in reactive gas distribution (e.g., O2,
CO2, CO) at 21 % O2 concentration but required consideration of char
gasification when O2 concentration exceeded 30 % in O2/CO2 atmo-
spheres [242]. Increasing excess air coefficients elevated NO, N2O, and
SO2 emissions [161]. Particle size and density respectively increased
and decreased the average char combustion rate [301]. Bubble dy-
namics significantly influenced particle content profiles, while a higher
ratio of secondary gas injection intensified gas-phase temperature fluc-
tuations, leading to localized hotspots within the bed. These hotspots
were closely associated with the vigorous combustion of volatile com-
pounds [160]. Wang et al. [90] numerically investigated char combus-
tion in a 2D BFB combustor, incorporating all heat transfer modes. For
reactive char particles, radiation and reaction heat dominated, while
radiation and convection were primary for inert sand particles (Fig. 22).
The highest particle Reynolds number (Rep) occurred in the bubble

phase, followed by the intermediate and emulsion phases. Char particles
had minimal impact on heat and mass transfer (Nusselt number, Nup,
and Sherwood number, Shp) but significantly influenced gas-solid mo-
mentum exchange (Rep). Enhanced gas-solid momentum exchange
positively affected heat and mass transfer performance.

Previous simulations primarily focused on normal temperature and
pressure conditions. A study explored shock-wave-induced layered coal-
dust combustion in a narrow channel using CFD-DEM for fully
compressible gas-solid reacting flows at Mach 1.3 [302]. A shock wave,
generated by gas detonation, dispersed coal-dust particles positioned at
the bottom (Fig. 23). The flame structure included a leading shock wave
and a diffusion flame, with flame propagation velocities of 350â500 m/s
causing particle heating and devolatilization behind the reaction front.
The modelling was further extended to include droplet break-up for
analyzing gaseous detonations with dilute water sprays [303]. Given
that the Biot number is much less than one, intraparticle temperature
gradients are negligible, and the particle-specific heat is assumed con-
stant. Droplet evaporation is modelled using the method proposed by
Abramzon and Sirignano [304], while the convective heat flux is
calculated based on the Ranz-Marshall correlation [125]. The droplet
break-up occurs under the assumption that the droplet diameter

decreases linearly during the break-up process [305]. It is a phenome-
nological model based on the critical Weber number (Wec) and the
non-dimensional total break-up time, as described by Brodkey [306] and
Pilch and Erdman [307], respectively.

The premixed mixture consisted of a slightly diluted stoichiometric
hydrogen-oxygen mixture at low pressure. To analyze the simulated
results, 2-D flow fields and statistical Favre spatiotemporal averaging
techniques were employed. The gaseous detonation with water droplets
propagated stably but at a slower velocity compared to the dry
Chapman-Jouguet speed. Simulating the droplet combustion process
faces challenges due to the complexity of fuel types, such as methane
and propane, which exhibit highly irregular cellular structures and
turbulent burning effects. Low initial pressures and multiphase in-
teractions,
further
complicate the dynamics by altering the reactivity of the mixture. While
2D simulations capture key features, neglecting 3D effects and boundary
layer influences may lead to inaccuracies, especially under varying
stability conditions. These factors underscore the difficulty of accurately
modelling multiphase reactive flows and interfacial phenomena.

3.1.5. Discussion

CFD-DEM simulation studies have extensively explored multiple
aspects of solid fuel drying, pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion.
These studies have aimed to achieve several key research objectives,
including:

(a) Development of sub-models suitable for complex operating con-
ditions. These sub-models include a drying model that considers
the cohesion effect, a pyrolysis model that incorporates detailed
reaction kinetics, a gasification model that accounts for particle
non-isothermal effects, a combustion model that considers the

sand inhibition effect, and a non-spherical particle model that
takes into account the particle shape effect.

(b) Understanding of coupling mechanisms between different scales.
These mechanisms include microscopic particle information (e.
g., diffusion, heat transfer, shrinkage), mesoscopic bubble evo-
lution (e.g., coalescence and breakage), and macroscopic reactor
performance (e.g., pressure drop, outlet
temperature, and
composition concentration);

(c) Operation control and reaction optimization. This includes opti-
mizing the heat transfer of particles by implementing immersed
bundles, improving carbon conversion degree by varying the
feeding height of solid fuels, and scaling up fluidized bed reactors
based on dimensionless numbers. These optimizations aim to
enhance the systemâs performance and efficiency.

Drawing upon the insights gained from the aforementioned extensive
CFD-DEM simulations concerning the thermochemical conversion of
solid fuels, several avenues for future research can be explored. These
include:

(a) Development of intrinsic kinetics models. Future research could
focus on developing fully intrinsic kinetic models using molecular
dynamic simulations or well-controlled experiments. This
approach would enable a better understanding of the underlying
chemistry behind the combustion and gasification processes.

(b) Advancement of experimental measurement

techniques. To
validate simulation results, advanced experimental measuring
techniques capable of measuring hydrodynamics in hot flow re-
actors need to be developed. By bridging the gap between sim-
ulations and experimental data, these techniques will improve
the overall reliability and fidelity of the modelling approach.

(c) Utilization of machine learning models. Machine learning algo-
rithms can be used to construct general prediction models that
capture correction factors associated with different feedstocks
and operating conditions, thereby facilitating the optimization
and prediction of thermochemical conversion processes.

(d) Optimization of numerical stability. The glued-sphere and super-
quadric particle methods need to be optimized to enhance nu-
merical stability, thus improving the accuracy of the modelling
approach.

These research directions have the potential to enhance the ther-
mochemical conversion of solid fuels, resulting in more efficient con-
version processes and the advancement of sustainable energy solutions.

3.2. Blast furnace ironmaking

Blast furnace (BF) ironmaking is a crucial process in metallurgy,
producing hot metal from iron ore with high energy efficiency [308]. As
the dominant ironmaking method, it accounts for over 70 % of a steel
plantâs total energy consumption [309], making energy efficiency im-
provements essential for reducing both energy usage and pollutant
emissions [310]. Fig. 24 illustrates the BFâs role as a prosumer in the
energy flow network. It consumes coke, pulverized coal injection (PCI),
and hot blast, while generating energy through the conversion of coke
and coal, which is stored and reused [310]. The BF operates as a
high-temperature moving bed reactor, involving complex interactions
among counter-, co-, and cross-current flows of gas, liquid, solid, and
powder, coupled with heat and mass transfer and chemical reactions.
This complexity presents challenges in understanding gas-solid flow
dynamics and thermochemical behaviours. CFD-DEM simulations
address these challenges by focusing on three key BF zones: (i) coke
combustion in the raceway zone, (ii) iron ore reduction in the lumpy
zone, and (iii) melting and dripping processes in the cohesion and
dripping zones.

3.2.1. Coke combustion

As the CFD-DEM simulation of coke combustion in the raceway of a
BF using the CFD-DEM, the k-Îµ model was utilized to accurately capture
the intricate gas turbulence within the system, while the eddy dissipa-
tion model (EDM) was employed to characterize the combustion of gases
[311]. Additionally, the shrinking core model was implemented to
effectively represent the mass change of coke particles. Two competing
reaction models were utilized to describe coal devolatilization. The
small coal particles lose their momentum by collision with coke particles
and accumulate on the surface of the cavity for the PCI operation. The
shape and size of the raceway and its temperature could be controlled by
blast temperature and blast compositions. The uniform combustion zone
with a low-temperature atmosphere could be effectively formed by ni-
trogen enrichment. A lower blast temperature enlarged the raceway
size. Enlarging blast inlet velocity and discharge rate gave rise to a larger
raceway cavity, however, elevating bed inventory showed the opposite
effect [312]. The change in depth of the cavities and the shape of the
deadman correlated with blast volume but not with oxygen enrichment
[313]. These two operating parameters directly influenced the height of
the cavity. In a subsequent study, an isothermal assumption was made
for the coke particles [314], implying that the thermal gradient inside
the coke particle was not taken into account. Moreover, the heteroge-
neous reactions of the char-oxygen reaction (R4) and char-carbon di-
oxide reaction (C + CO2 = 2CO) were explicitly described within the
raceway. The heterogeneous reactions took into account various re-
sistances, including film resistance, ash layer resistance, and surface
reaction resistance [314]. The validity of this model is confirmed by
comparing it with experimental measurements of gas species distribu-
tion from the tuyere tip to the rear wall (Fig. 25). The coke combustion
primarily occurs within a localized ring-shaped zone, which encases the
high-voidage cavity. The rind-type distribution of CO2 could be captured
only if the mass diffusion effect in the reaction kinetics was considered.
A lower inlet velocity, higher bed temperature, and higher oxygen mass
fraction resulted in increased CO production and improved BF perfor-
mance [314]. In a subsequent study [315], a shrinkage model was
incorporated into the CFD-DEM framework, accounting for the changes

in particle size during the mass loss of coke particles. Consistent distri-
butions of coke temperature, carbon loss, and diameter variation were
observed across all conditions. The majority of coke combustion
occurred near the tuyere, which correlated with a more pronounced
circular gas flow at elevated temperatures. Although an increase in ox-
ygen concentration led to higher carbon monoxide levels, the inlet gas
temperature and flow rate had negligible effects on carbon monoxide
levels under the specified experimental conditions.

Recently, the application of the CFD-DEM method in BFs has
advanced significantly, with several innovative approaches improving
the understanding of particle-scale processes. A novel multi-resolution
hybrid CFD-DEM model was applied to simulate the flow dynamics of
gas, unburnt powders, and coke particles in blast furnaces, addressing
challenges posed by significant size disparities between coke particles
and coal or biochar powders. The results showed that increasing gas
inlet velocity enlarged the raceway cavity and accelerated powder
transport into the coke bed, while higher powder wettability reduces
powder penetration, aligning peak holdup positions and decreasing
permeability at key probe locations [316].

One study employed a coarse-grained reacting CFD-DEM (rCFD-
DEM) model to simulate the thermochemical behaviours in the BF shaft,
reducing computational cost by 89 % while maintaining accuracy [317].
This model captured the interaction between iron ore reduction and

operations. Another study developed an advanced rCFD-DEM model
incorporating both a coarse-graining and smoothing method to simulate
raceway dynamics and coke combustion, achieving a 78 % reduction in
computational cost [318]. The results highlighted the role of blast rate
and oxygen content in raceway expansion and gas species distribution.
Further, a novel rCFD-DEM approach was used to simulate multiple
raceways in an industrial-scale BF, capturing dynamic raceway phe-
nomena and suggesting that voidage thresholds are crucial for accu-
rately simulating raceway morphology [319]. Another breakthrough
involved the development of a CFD-DEM-DPM model to explicitly pre-
dict
complex
fluid-particle-fine interactions during coke and pulverized coal com-
bustion [320]. This model provided new insights into coal injection and
raceway expansion. Finally, the use of a coarse-grained method and the
flamelet generated manifold (FGM) model enabled large-scale BF sim-
ulations [321], revealing the distinct formation of physical and chemical
raceways and the impact of pulverized coal combustion on raceway
dynamics. Collectively, these studies underscore the CFD-DEM methodâs
potential for optimizing blast furnace operations by reducing compu-
tational costs and improving process accuracy.

Iron ore reduction

The reduction of iron ore in the lumpy zone of BFs proceeds at a slow
rate due to the large number of particles involved. Consequently, it takes

several hours for solid particles to descend from the top to the bottom of
the furnace [309]. Therefore, a lengthy physical time must be simulated
to obtain meaningful results that encompass a complete cycle of the
process. Table 2 provides a comprehensive list of the main chemical
reactions involved and their respective kinetics, which encompass the
sequential
transformations from hematite (Fe2O3) into magnetite
(Fe3O4), followed by magnetiteâs reduction to wustite (FeO), and finally
wustiteâs conversion to iron (Fe). The wustite is not a stable phase below
C and thus, the reduction will follow the path Fe2O3âFe3O4âFe.

A shrinking core model and a three-layered unreacted shrinking core
model were integrated into the CFD-DEM framework to study the
reduction process of a sintered hematite pellet using CO and H2 gases as
reducing agents [164]. The former model was deemed inadequate in
representing the various reaction steps, while the latter model was
recommended for utilization. The shrinking core model was satisfacto-
rily validated while only preliminary results for the chemical reaction
resistance of the three-layered unreacted shrinking core model were
presented. In a subsequent study [322], the model was extended to
incorporate the morphological changes of the ore. The findings offered
valuable insights into the impact of kinetic parameters such as
pre-exponential factors and activation energies on the degree of reduc-
tion. Notably, the reduction step from wustite to iron was the deter-
mining factor in the overall rate of reduction. The three-layered
unreacted shrinking core model demonstrated significant potential for
accurately describing the reduction process of iron ore and has been
increasingly integrated into various multi-scale numerical frameworks
[323]. The iron ore reduction process for a single hematite pellet by
using greenhouse gas was further studied [162]. A one-interface
unreacted shrinking core model was employed to characterize the
topological-chemical progression of the reduction process, considering
chemical reaction resistance, intra-particle diffusion resistance, and gas
film resistance. The gas film resistance had minimal impact on the
reduction rates, with an error of approximately 3 %. The reduction rate
exhibited a significant increase with increasing pressure, reaching a
peak at 5 atm. Using the non-isothermal conditions slowed the reduction
process compared to using the isothermal conditions. Peters et al. [324]
used the CFD-DEM method to explore the reduction of iron ore in a
packed bed. The thermodynamic state of both reactive particles and the
surrounding gas flow was in line with experimental data. A study on the
heat and mass transport in ironmaking using a novel helical structure of
coke and ore layers in a packed bed was conducted [165] (Fig. 26). The
simulation model represented the BF shaft as a cylindrical column, 2 m
in radius and 12 m in height, containing 1,569,600 iron ore particles and
196,200 coke particles. The domain was divided into hexahedral cells,
with particles layered and charged accordingly. Results showed that the
H2 reduction of iron ore was influenced by particle arrangement and gas
composition, with endothermic reactions linked to exothermic ones.
Convection significantly impacted temperature distribution, which was
closely related to gas velocity and affected reaction rates.

A comparative analysis of the helical structure of coke and ore layers
versus the traditional layer-by-layer structure showed that the helical
arrangement improved gas flow within the packed bed [325]. Although
increasing gas flow in a coke layer with larger grains did not signifi-
cantly affect the bedâs permeability, the helical structure reduced the
gaseous phase inflow to the ore bed, thereby decreasing the ore

reduction rate. The effect on the layer thickness was minimal. Even with
a lower coke ratio, a thicker layer was maintained, resulting in a more
permeable helical structure. To address the high computational cost of
CFD-DEM simulations, a coarse-grained CFD-DEM method was used
[317], reducing the number of coke and ore particles by 89 % while
maintaining accuracy [165,325]. A quasi-steady-state model was
developed to analyze the thermochemical characteristics throughout the
entire blast furnace (BF) [163] (Fig. 27). The model made several as-
sumptions: the cohesion zone was updated by adjusting the particle
Youngâs modulus based on temperature to capture the softening
behaviour of iron ore; ore and coke particles were alternately introduced
into the BF; and hot blast injection was considered. However, coke/-
pulverized coal combustion in the raceway, liquid generation in the
cohesion zone, and reactions involving liquid droplets were not
included. The model simulated a simplified 2D BF with a small particle
count, but for accurate long-term predictions (approximately 4 h per
cycle), transient phenomena and a larger number of particles must be
incorporated.

Simulating particle-fluid interactions in moving bed reactors like BFs
is computationally expensive due to the wide range of spatial and
temporal scales involved. Traditional methods struggle with long-term,
large-scale heat transfer simulations, but recent innovations have
significantly improved this. A new approach using high-fidelity data
from the CFD-DEM enables fast, data-assisted simulations that can
efficiently model granular motion and heat transfer over extended pe-
riods. This methodology was applied to a large-scale BF slot model (28m
height and 15m width) over many hours, allowing for the determination
of thermal steady states and the cohesive zone (CZ) shape and location
without requiring extensive prior knowledge [326]. This advancement
represents a crucial step toward realistic virtual experiments, enabling
parameter variations and potential online monitoring systems for BFs.
Another innovative approach combines models for granular motion,
interfacial mass, momentum, heat transfer, and multi-step reactions into
a single, efficient framework. By integrating data from CFD-DEM sim-
ulations, long-term studies become feasible, including a full-scale 3D BF
model that achieved a thermo-chemical steady state over 20 h [327].
This framework can be easily extended to create digital twins, allowing
for the optimization of reactor designs and the exploration of new
configurations. These advancements in CFD-DEM modelling are trans-
forming the ability to simulate and optimize the complex processes in
blast furnaces.

3.2.3.

Iron ore melting and dripping

The cohesive zone, where iron ore undergoes softening and melting,
plays a crucial role in determining the permeability of the zone,
impacting both product quality and carbon dioxide mitigation efficiency
[328]. Due to powder pressure, phase-change ore deforms and pene-
trates the gap between burden bed materials. In this zone, the molten
slag and metallic-iron phases interconnect [329], making it challenging
to simulate the multi-physics and multi-scale processes under the
CFD-DEM framework.

The melting and dripping behaviours have been addressed through
the introduction of the moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method
[330]. This novel approach represents the liquid phase as a collection of
discrete particles, allowing for a comprehensive representation of its
motion, including the behaviour of the free surface as a dispersed phase.
The MPS method can also couple with surface tension and wettability
models, aiming to take the inter-particle tension into account. The above
strategies make it possible for the MPS method to express the changing
condition of dispersion, coalescence, and distribution of droplets, their
interaction with the packed bed as it is affected by the wetting phe-
nomenon, and the successively changing shapes of the droplets, which
become issues when modelling the liquid flow in the bottom of the BF
[330]. The model has been successfully applied to analyze liquid flows
in packed beds, including investigations into the dispersion and coa-
lescence of liquids within packed beds, as well as the influence of melt

properties on liquid dripping [331] and the impact of packed bed
structure on liquid flow [332]. Meanwhile, a boundary for non-spherical
granular media was employed to simulate trickle flow based on weakly
compressible MPS [333]. The shape of the elements, even when of equal

volume, was found to affect the velocity and hold-up amount of the
liquid passage. An integrated model was proposed to couple with 3D
scanning to determine the size and shape of ore particles [329] (Fig. 28).
Specifically, an advanced discrete element method (ADEM) that

discretizes a continuous viscoelastic phase by moving particles was
utilized to describe the transient thermal softening behaviour of the ore,
and 3D gravitational deformation on gas-solid flow characteristics could
be well obtained. Although the model was based on a cold state without
chemical reactions [329], it is a promising method for simulating the
softening and melting process in the BF at the particle scale.

Recently, the droplet of melted iron ores impingement on solid
particles was numerically investigated, focusing on drag force and
Nusselt number variations. The results revealed that larger droplet sizes
and higher initial positions significantly enhanced the drag force and
Nusselt number, while gas velocity has minimal impact [334]. After
then, a novel numerical
framework that couples CFD-DEM-VOF
modeling with a discretized thermodynamic phase diagram to simu-
late solid phase changes in fluid-solid systems under varying conditions.
The model was validated through multiple cases and applied to the
melting process of FexCy particles, demonstrating its capability to
accurately reproduce phase transitions influenced by temperature and
carbon composition variations [335]. The model was further used to
simulate multiphase flow and phase change in the laser powder bed
fusion process. The model successfully captured key phenomena such as
temperature distribution and molten track morphology, providing a

cost-effective solution for understanding and optimizing laser powder
bed fusion in additive manufacturing [336]. In addition to their work,
several other methods were proposed to handle the softening and
melting process of iron ore such as the DEM-SPH method [337], how-
ever, it was beyond the scope of the current review focusing on
CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow.

3.2.4. Discussion

Ironmaking BF is a non-linearly complex system involving multi-
phase reacting flow. The simulation of dense gas-solid reacting flow in
BFs has the following challenges:

(a) Strong coupling between multi-physics processes. Kinematics
include inter-particle collisions,
liquid/gas-particle two-phase
interaction, and gas-particle-liquid three-phase interaction. Heat
transfer includes convection, conduction, radiation, and heat of
reaction. Chemical reactions include the thermochemical con-
version processes (e.g., drying, pyrolysis, gasification, and com-
bustion) of pulverized coal, as well as the combustion of coke in
the raceway and the reduction of iron ore in the shaft layer.

homogeneous reactions occurring throughout the entire blast
furnace system. The phase state evolution includes the defor-
mation of iron particles under high-burden loading and the phase
change of iron ore from a solid state to a liquid-solid co-existence
state.

(b) Multi-scale or cross-scale co-existence. The typical particle sizes
of the pulverized coal, iron ore, and coke are about 50 Î¼m, 20
mm, and 40 mm, respectively. Such cross-scale particle size dis-
tribution challenges the interpolation and mapping procedures
between Euler grids and Lagrange particles. Besides, the di-
ameters of the tuyere and the BF are about 0.15 m 15 m, with a
size ratio of 100, challenging the grid resolution of the compu-
tational domain. Fine grids lead to unaffordable computational
costs while coarse grids cannot resolve the tuyere. Cross-scale or
multi-scale particulate flow simulations also exist in many in-
dustrial and environmental processes, such as biomass gasifica-
tion and coal combustion in fluidized beds. The interactions
between fine and coarse particles in these flows strongly influ-
ence flow dynamics. However, simulating these interactions
accurately across multiple scales presents significant challenges,
particularly in terms of computational cost and capturing
detailed micro-scale phenomena.

(c) Large-scale geometry and long-time operation. A typical BF in the
practical ironmaking process is about 30 m with millions even
billions of particles (e.g., coke, pulverized coal). Such huge
amounts make it difficult to track the trajectory of each particle.
Besides, a whole cycle of iron ore discharging process lasts for a
physical time of 4 h, beyond the capability of the traditional CFD-
DEM simulation that is commonly conducted for a physical time
of several seconds or minutes.

To address the above challenges during the CFD-DEM simulation of
the ironmaking blast furnace, future work is suggested to be conducted
regarding the following aspects:

(a) Development of sophisticated particle-scale methods to describe
the gas-solid flow, gas-solid-liquid flow, particle deformation and
breakage, particle melting and dripping, and non-spherical par-
ticle dynamics;

(b) Development of advanced methods to describe the cross-scale
particulate flow. Recent advancements include hybrid or mixed
CFD-DEM models that combine features from both resolved and
unresolved methods [338â342]. For example, resolved methods
can be applied to coarse particles, while unresolved methods
handle fine particles, and semi-resolved methods manage in-
teractions for particles of intermediate sizes. These hybrid ap-
proaches allow for more efficient and accurate simulations across
a broader range of particle sizes, making them suitable for
modelling complex, cross-scale particulate flows.

(c) Development of speed-up methods to describe the huge particles
and long-time operation, such as the coarse-grained method.

3.3. Low-carbon techniques

3.3.1. Chemical looping combustion

Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a novel combustion method
that transfers oxygen from the air to fuel via an active metal oxide
(MxOy) (Fig. 29). In the reduction reactor, hydrocarbon fuels are
oxidized while MxOy is reduced to a metal oxide with a lower divalent or
reactive metal. This process is common in biomass/fuel combustion,
with metals potentially redirected to the combustion reactor as metal
fuels, leading to zero CO2 emissions. CLC enables fuel combustion using
oxygen from a metal oxide carrier (e.g., copper, iron, or nickel) instead
of air, offering the advantage of producing high-purity CO2 without
additional energy consumption for CO2 separation, thus reducing cap-
ture costs [343].

As shown in Fig. 29(b), a typical CLC unit consists of a dual fluidized
bed. In this setup, a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) serves as the air
reactor, while a BFB/CFB/spouted bed acts as the fuel reactor. In the fuel
reactor, fuel undergoes oxidation to produce CO2 and H2O, while a
metal oxide (MxOy) is reduced to its corresponding metal (M). The ox-
ygen carrier, in metal particle form, is then transported to the air reactor
for re-oxidation by oxygen, regenerating the metal oxide. This oxide is
cycled back to the fuel reactor. Reactions in the air reactor are typically
exothermic, while those in the fuel reactor may be endothermic or
exothermic, depending on fuel gas composition and oxygen carrier type.
Despite differences, the overall enthalpy change of CLC is equivalent to
that of conventional combustion:

(2n + m-p)MxOy + CnH2mOp â (2n + m-p)MxOy-1 + nCO2 + mH2 (R5)

(2n + m-p)MxOy-1 + (n + m/2-p/2)O2 â (2n + m-p)MxOy

CnH2mOp + (n + m/2-p/2)O2 â nCO2 + mH2O

(R6)

(R7)

The reduction process of oxygen carriers is often described using the
shrinking core model, which assumes that the oxygen carrier can be
represented as a porous sphere composed of multiple spherical grains,
each with a uniform radius rg. The model is given by:

where the kinetic constant k is determined using the Arrhenius law.
More detailed information on the specific kinetic parameters can be
found in a recent publication [345].

Due to the complex geometry, gas-solid flow dynamics, heat and
mass transfer, and intense chemical reactions in the CLC process, CFD-
DEM simulations have been scarce in the literature (Table S11 of Sup-
plementary Materials). In a recent study [345], a numerical investiga-
tion analyzed the flow hydrodynamics and chemical reactions in the fuel
reactor of a coal-direct CLC process. The integrated model included
sub-models for heat and mass transfer, such as conduction, convection,
radiation, drying, and gasification, and considered heterogeneous re-
actions between char and oxygen carriers. A modified drag model, ac-
counting for polydispersity effects, was used to describe inter-phase
interactions. A dual-side coal feeding arrangement was recommended to
enhance reactor condition uniformity. In a similar study [346], the
reactive flow of coal-direct CLC was examined using various Fe-based
oxygen carriers in a quasi-3D spout fluidized bed reactor. The
inter-phase interaction was modelled with the Syamlal-OâBrien drag
model, though gas turbulence was not explicitly resolved. It was found
that Fe2O3 bed materials caused poor fluidization and circulation due to
their high density, which was improved by using a mixed bed of 60 wt%
Fe2O3 and 40 wt% MgAl2O4. A high jet velocity created a bypass
pathway, hindering the pressure buildup needed for bubble formation.
Additionally, a high-fidelity simulation of a 3D full-loop CLC unit was
performed using ANSYS Fluent 14.5 with 218,175 particles, requiring
about two months to simulate 260 s of physical time [347]. The results,
shown in Fig. 30, demonstrated good agreement with experimental data
on pressure distribution and solid circulation rates, validating the
modelâs accuracy in simulating the CLC process.

3.3.2. Zero-carbon metal fuels

Zero-carbon metal fuels are promising alternatives to fossil fuels in a
low-carbon economy. These fuels, with high energy densities due to
their electronic structure and bond energy, can be burned with air or
reacted with water in both dry and wet cycles to release chemical en-
ergy. The resulting metal-oxide combustion products can be recycled via
electrolytic reduction. However, several challenges hinder the wide-
spread use of metal fuels [348]. At the particle level, balancing a low

oxidation rate with high operating pressures and temperatures is crucial,
while oxide layer formation can impede further reactions. At the
mesoscale, particle bonding and nanoparticle agglomeration can affect
reactions. At the reactor scale, combustor technologies must withstand
high pressure and temperature, have good thermal conductivity, and
enable effective heat and mass transfer. Finally, at the system scale,
aligning oxidant generation, electrochemical reduction rates, and costs
is essential for a controllable power generation process. The wet cycle is

An improved coarse-grained CFD-DEM method was developed to
study the agglomeration behaviour of micro-sized combusted iron par-
ticles [349]. The inter-particle cohesive force was established as a
temperature-dependent solid bridge force. The superficial velocity of the
gas had an insignificant effect on the defluidization behaviour. In a
recent study on dense powder fuel injection [350], it was observed that
the particle velocity decreases as the nozzle convergence angle in-
creases. Currently, there is limited research on the simulation of metal
fuels. However, it is believed that numerical simulations using the
CFD-DEM have great potential for applications in cluster formation,
reaction rate control, and reactor design in the field of metal
combustion.

3.3.3. Methanation

Methanation is a promising process for converting gas mixtures
containing CO/CO2 and H2 (e.g., synthesis gas or pyrolysis gas from coal
or biomass) into CH4-enriched gas. The main goal is to produce synthetic
natural gas or liquid natural gas with high heating values. This process
provides a potential solution for reducing carbon emissions and
addressing the natural gas demand gap. Methanation in fluidized bed
reactors involves two key reactions: the CO methanation reaction (R10)
and the water-gas-shift reaction (R11):

CO + 3H â CH4 + H2O ÎH298K = (cid:0) 206.28 kJâmol
(cid:0) 1

CO + H2O â CO2 + H2 ÎH298K = (cid:0) 41.46 kJâmol

(cid:0) 1

(R10)

(R11)

In the first study of the methanation process using the CFD-DEM
method in a 2D BFB reactor [351], it was observed that changes in the
volumetric flow rate had a minor impact on the expansion of the
emulsion phase for Geldart B particles. However, a significant contrac-
tion of the emulsion phase was observed, and the degree of contraction
was strongly influenced by superficial gas velocity. Recently, the
methanation process within a 2D BFB reactor was investigated by
incorporating modified methanation kinetics into the CFD-DEM frame-
work [352]. The model utilized a mesoscale structure to accurately
capture the evolution of bubbles. An approximate image processing
method was employed to obtain bubble properties and expansion
height, allowing for precise localization, measurement, and tracking of
bubbles. The results demonstrated that the drag model dependent on the
local structure outperformed the Gidaspow and BVK drag models in
predicting bubble properties and bed expansion. This superiority can be
attributed to the formerâs capability to account for heterogeneous flow
structures, whereas the latter models were derived based on homoge-
neous systems. Youngâs modulus emerged as one of the most influential
parameters in describing particle motion but exhibited minimal impact
on bubble hydrodynamics and time-averaged results. Enhancing nu-
merical efficiency was achieved by reducing Youngâs modulus.

3.3.4. Absorption

After the CLC process, capturing highly concentrated CO2 for storage
and transportation is essential. Among various methods, alkali metal-
based sorbents in fixed or bubbling fluidized beds offer a promising
approach for CO2 absorption and desorption [353,354]. A recent study
[354] used K2CO3 solid sorbents in a quasi-3D BFB reactor for CO2
capture. The results showed a core-annulus flow structure with signifi-
cant back-mixing, where bubbles enhanced CO2 reactions by promoting
mixing but also limited conversion due to the short gas passage. Using
the same DEM-based model, a plug flow model [354] and a bubbling
two-phase model [355] were developed. The plug flow model showed
similar trends to the DEM-based model, but the bubbling two-phase
model had superior predictive capability, making it ideal for studying
CO2 capture in BFB reactors.

Semipermeable microcapsules filled with sodium carbonate solu-
tions offer significantly higher CO2 absorption rates compared to K2CO3
solid sorbents [356]. A mechanistic model, incorporating mass transfer
and chemical reactions, was developed to investigate microcapsule

performance under various CO2 capture conditions [353,357]. This
model was integrated with the CFD-DEM framework to analyze the
behaviour of 276,559 microcapsules in fixed and fluidized beds
(Fig. 31). A modified film theory described CO2 and H2O absorption and
desorption, accounting for transfer rates and the vapour-liquid-solid
equilibrium within the capsules. Changes in particle size and density
were modelled based on mass variation, and capsule deformation due to
internal volume changes caused pressure differentials. The modelâs ac-
curacy was validated through good agreement with experimental data
on CO2 absorption rates and gas temperature evolution. Additionally,
the response of a bench-scale microcapsule absorber and regenerator
was examined under different operating conditions, providing valuable
insights into performance.

3.3.5. Discussion

The CLC, methanation, and absorption processes are effective CO2
reduction techniques that benefit both the environment and society.
While the CFD-DEM method is widely applied in these fields, it is often
limited to simplified 2D geometries or single components. In a full-loop
CLC unit, heat generated in the air reactor is transferred to the fuel
reactor, facilitating gasification, while char is transported for combus-
tion. This self-thermal system underscores the need for full-loop simu-
lations that consider interactions between the two reactors. However,
challenges arise in CFD-DEM simulations, including (i) complex geom-
etries, (ii) coexistence of different fluidization regimes, and (iii)
capturing mesoscale phenomena such as bubbles in BFBs and clusters in
CFBs. Future research should focus on (i) applying cut-cell technology
for complex grid generation, (ii) selecting suitable drag models for both
homogeneous and heterogeneous flow, and (iii) better understanding
the mesoscale phenomena and their interactions across different scales.
When performing CFD-DEM simulations for methanation and absorp-
tion processes commonly found in fixed beds and BFB reactors with
moderate flow velocities,
it is essential to carefully consider the
following aspects:

(a) The development of fully intrinsic kinetics by employing molec-
conducting well-controlled

simulations or

ular dynamic
experiments.

(b) The investigation of machine learning techniques to derive
comprehensive reaction kinetics that can be applied to different
feedstocks and operating conditions.

(c) The integration of machine learning (ML) with the transient CFD-
DEM method to achieve a balance between numerical accuracy
and computational efficiency.

3.4. Catalytic fluidized beds

Catalytic fluidized beds are a process that transforms inexpensive,
heavy hydrocarbons into several high-value products such as gasoline
and light olefinic compounds. For more than five decades, fluidized beds
have been the preferred reactors utilized for the fluid catalytic cracking
(FCC) process [358].

3.4.1. Mass transfer

A detailed investigation has been conducted on the thermal behav-
iour of gas and solid phases within a fluidized bed reactor specifically
designed for the production of polyolefin and polypropylene [359]. The
simulation was performed on two different bed sizes, with 14,000 and
28,000 particles, respectively. The energy balance was established by
incorporating Arrhenius-type zero-order kinetic equations, taking into
account the influence of catalyst weight. A hot spot was formed at the
bottom corner, and its degree of intensity was directly linked to the level
of mixing. In a subsequent study, a mass transfer model was integrated
with the CFD-DEM method for simulating the decomposition of ozone on
iron oxide catalysts in a 2D spouted bed reactor employing 40,000
catalyst particles [360]. The molar fraction of unconverted ozone was

found to be higher in the central region of the bed, both in the gas and
solid phases, while it was relatively lower near the wall region. By
investigating the impact of gas-volume changes caused by ozone
decomposition-induced chemical reactions on the gas-solid hydrody-
namics in a BFB reactor, researchers observed significant influences of
gas volume changes on various aspects, including bed expansion, su-
perficial gas velocity, bubble size frequency, and inventory [283].

Bubble dynamics triggered by chemical reactions played a crucial
role in determining the thermochemical characteristics of gas-solid
flows within fluidized beds [361]. By assessing the mass transfer be-
tween the bubble-to-emulsion phases under non-isothermal conditions
within a BFB and the effects of varying injection temperatures on mass
transfer behaviour, researchers observed uneven temperature distribu-
tion inside bubbles led to non-uniform gas concentration [297]. The
mass transfer process for two vertically separated bubbles was signifi-
cantly strengthened in the final period, owing to the vigorous âsuction
effectâ from the upper bubble. When two bubbles were horizontally
injected, the mass transfer was relatively weak. In a recent study
regarding the ozone deposition process within a CFB riser [362], the
correlation between the clustering phenomenon and the gas-solid con-
tact efficiency was investigated under various conditions, including
different superficial gas velocities, reaction rates, and dilution factors.
The study found that lower air-to-solid flux ratios resulted in a system
with higher heterogeneity, where clustering was more pronounced and
mass transfer was significantly affected. The presence of clusters

increased the resistance to mass transfer, leading to lower gas-solid
contact efficiency. This behaviour was attributed to the interactions
between the clusters and the upward gas flow, which hindered the mass
transfer process.

3.4.2. Chemical reactions

In contrast to previous studies focusing solely on the mass transfer
process, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on FCC performance
in both the riser and downer using a 4-lumped kinetic model [358]. This
model considered heat transfer behaviour, catalyst deactivation, and
complex gas-solid reactions. The results revealed a wide range of cata-
lyst activity residence time within the system. This variation was pri-
marily attributed to the non-uniform flow structures and the
back-mixing of catalyst particles in the riser. Consequently, these fac-
tors led to a decrease in selectivity towards the desired products. On the
other hand, in the downer, where catalyst particles were uniformly
distributed and a plug flow pattern was observed, better control over
selectivity to intermediate products was achieved. A four-lump kinetic
model was subsequently employed to investigate the impact of particle
clusters on the chemical performance of a downer reactor in the FCC
process [363]. The chemical reactions involved gasoil, gasoline, light
gas, and coke. A LES model with fine meshes (7 Ã 106 hexahedral cells
+ < 1) was employed to resolve gas turbulence. The 1D
meeting y
derived from 3D simulations considering two effectiveness factors
significantly reduced the computational costs [294]. In a subsequent

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience109(2025)10122140

S. Wang and Y. Shen

study [364], a 2D BFB was used to simulate the methanol-to-olefins
(MTO) process, which shares similarities with the FCC process. The
particle motion within the system was observed to exhibit a
core-annulus structure, which significantly enhanced the transfer effi-
ciency of reactants. Furthermore, the reaction efficiency of the MTO
process was significantly influenced by factors such as feed temperature,
inlet gas velocity, and the feed ratio of water to methanol. Detailed
surface chemistry was further incorporated with the CFD-DEM frame-
work [365]. The operator-splitting approach proved to be effective in
reducing the computational load associated with the detailed descrip-
tion of chemistry. By combining operator splitting with in situ adaptive
tabulation (ISAT), a notable fourfold increase in simulation speed was
achieved, thereby further enhancing computational efficiency. In a
recent study [366], a volume-filtered CFD-DEM framework was devel-
oped to simulate the catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapour in
a fully 3D CFB riser (Fig. 32). The model was validated against an en-
gineering model based on a continuously stirred tank reactor [367]. The
presence of particle clusters was observed to have a substantial effect on
the suppression of catalytic conversion rates during biomass pyrolysis
vapour. This led to a reduction of up to 50 %. To study the heterogeneity
caused by these clusters, a one-dimensional Reynolds-averaged trans-
port equation was formulated, and the unclosed terms related to het-
erogeneity were assessed.

A numerical investigation was further conducted on the MTO process
in a pilot-scale reactor, including coke deposition and catalyst deacti-
vation [368]. The EMMS drag model and a seven-lumped kinetic reac-
tion model were implemented on the GPU-based CFD-DEM framework.
The reactions involve the conversion of methanol (MeOH) into seven
products, namely CH4, C2H4, C3H6, C4H8, C5H10, and coke. The forma-
tion rate of each product (Ri) can be expressed as follows:

Ri = nikiÏiCMeOHMi

(55)

where ni represents the stoichiometric number, ki denotes the reaction
rate constant, CMeOH represents the concentration of methanol, and Mi
signifies the molar weight. The deactivation function, Ïi, is defined as
follows:

=

Ïi

A

1 + B exp(D Ã (wc (cid:0) E)) exp((cid:0) Î±iwi)

(56)

where wc is the coke content. A, B, D, and E are model constants. ki and Î±i
are calculated according to the literature [369]. The simulation was
performed on the upgraded Mole-8.5 super-computer and each simula-
tion case for the MTO reaction process was carried out for a total of 8 h.
As shown in Fig. 33, coke content had a linear correlation with the
residence time, but local conditions also exerted a significant impact on
the results. Catalyst particles near the distributor were not well mixed,
and the reaction rates oscillated remarkably even over a long period.
The EMMS-DPM method coupled with coarse-grained treatment, heat
transfer, and reaction kinetics was expected to be a promising tool in
studying gas-solid reactors involving long-time particle-scale dynamics
in FCC systems. In a recent study regarding the MTO process conducted
by the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sci-
ences in a commercial fluidized bed reactor [370], it was observed that
increasing the annual processing capacity by 20 % posed some chal-
lenges to reactor operation. Additionally, higher mass fractions of finer
catalysts resulted in more homogeneous MTO reactions and reduced
energy consumption.

3.4.3. Discussion

3.5. Incineration and calcination

Conducting CFD-DEM simulations for the FCC process in fluidized

bed reactors presents several notable challenges, including:

3.5.1. Municipal solid waste incineration

(a) Simplified reaction kinetics. Although the four-lumped or seven-
lumped kinetic model is incorporated in the CFD-DEM work, this
reaction kinetics do not take the coke deposition and catalyst
deactivation into account.

(b) Heterogeneous flow structures. Flow structures in the fluidized
bed reactors within fine particles (e.g., Geldart Group A) are
commonly heterogeneous, and a homogeneous drag model
cannot deliver reasonable flow patterns.

(c) Long-time simulation. The long-time simulation of the FCC or
MTO processes in fluidized bed reactors requires a substantial
physical time ranging from 8 to 10 h.

To effectively overcome the challenges associated with CFD-DEM
simulations of FCC processes in fluidized bed reactors, future research
should focus on the following areas:

(a) Development of fully intrinsic kinetics using molecular dynamic
simulations or well-controlled experiments. This could contribute
to a more comprehensive understanding of the chemical re-
actions occurring within the reactors.

(b) Introduction of heterogeneous drag models - such as filtered drag
model and EMMS drag model - to account for the effects of sub-
grid flow structures. This could greatly improve the accuracy of
drag force calculations and enhance simulation reliability.
(c) Development of speed-up methods to improve the calculation
efficiency, such as hardware acceleration by GPU and algorithms
acceleration by coarse-grained method in temporal and spatial
scales, respectively.

Thermal treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) in incineration
plants is a widely used method for producing heat and power, offering a
better alternative to landfill disposal, which poses environmental risks
[371]. The grate firing system is a common technology for MSW incin-
eration, where solid waste is transported on a moving grate, with pri-
mary air passing through the waste bed and secondary air introduced
into the furnaceâs freeboard. This systemâs advantage lies in not
requiring waste pretreatment, providing both economic and ecological
benefits. However, modelling grate firing systems is challenging due to
the variability in physical factors (e.g., humidity, density, size, shape)
and chemical factors (e.g., particle shrinkage, heating value, composi-
tion), leading to limited CFD-DEM simulations specifically focusing on
MSW incineration.

A study investigated the combustion of wood pellets in domestic
heating systems [60], using a polyhedral approximation to represent
their non-spherical shape and a shrinkage model for particle conversion.
Radiative heat transfer was assessed by considering each particleâs
surface triangularity. The release of water vapour, volatiles, and gas
products during drying, pyrolysis, and combustion was modelled.
Asymmetric fuel feeding led to a deflection of the gas flame towards one
side of the combustor. In the first study simulating the thermochemical
conversion of solid waste in a grate firing system [137], the grate surface
was modelled as an interface for mass, thermal, and species exchange.
The results were qualitatively reliable for the waste layer and combus-
tion chamber. Further research on MSW incineration in a grate firing
system using ANSYS Fluent [372,373] showed that the temperature
front in thermally thick particles governs drying and pyrolysis, while a
char burnout model accounts for CO/CO2 reactions. As illustrated in
Fig. 34, the developed model aligned well with experimental data,
especially regarding gas temperature and species concentrations. Par-
ticle segregation was influenced by particle size and density, and
increasing the mass flow rate reduced particle residence time. Enlarging

the radiative heat flux and adding plastic accelerated drying, volatile
release, and char conversion. The continuous particle size distribution
caused vertical dispersion of char conversion on the grate. A recent
study investigated the thermochemical characteristics of radioactive
cesium during waste incineration [374]. To reduce computational costs
associated with the large number of residual ash particles, an assembly
model based on cohesive forces was proposed. The cohesive forces
significantly influenced the drying, pyrolysis, and char conversion pro-
cesses. Numerical simulations using this model showed excellent
agreement with experimental data, particularly in terms of the tem-
perature at the furnace outlet.

3.5.2. Calcination and carbonation

Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) distinguishes itself among numerous
thermal storage materials due to its notable advantages, including (a) a
high heat storage density of 3.26 GJ/m3, (b) a wide range of reaction
C, and (c) the availability of
temperatures ranging from 700
inexpensive raw sources. The dissociation of limestone calcite, i.e.,
CaCO3, into calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO) at elevated
temperatures is a well-established reversible reaction [375]:

C to 900

â¦

â¦

CaCO3 â CaO + CO2 ÎH298K = +178 kJâmol

(cid:0) 1

(R12)

The forward reaction, where calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide
(CO2) are formed, is referred to as calcination. By contrast, the reverse
reaction, which involves the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
from calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, is known as carbonation.

The heat for the endothermic process in a lime shaft kiln is supplied
by combusting natural gas within the moving bulk. This widely used
technology can handle various particle sizes, resulting in different
decomposition times for each particle. At the particle scale, the calci-
nation reaction proceeds from the surface to the interior, forming a
highly porous CaO outer shell. The reaction rate depends on heat
transfer from the surrounding gas and CO2 mass transfer from the par-
ticle interior. A lime shaft kiln aims for complete calcination with a

uniform radial temperature distribution. A 3D model of the lime shaft
kiln using the CFD-DEM method on the ANSYS CFX platform incorpo-
rated the shrinking core model to account for particle conduction and
CO2 diffusion [375]. The modelâs predictions were in good agreement
with experimental data on decomposition rates but did not include
combustion. A comprehensive model using the ANSYS Fluent platform
was developed to study the dynamics of a 3D industrial-scale shaft kiln
with a moving and reactive bed [376]. The model incorporated ther-
mochemical processes at the particle level and gas-phase combustion. To
capture the heat/mass transfer and chemical reaction interactions
within porous limestone particles, a one-dimensional model was used,
considering both diffusion and advection. Radial temperature gradients
were observed in the calcination zone and within the limestone parti-
cles. The advective mass transfer was essential for realistic reactor
behaviour. In a subsequent study, the model was applied to investigate
flow fields and thermochemical characteristics in a 3D vertical parallel
flow regenerative lime shaft kiln (Fig. 35) [377]. The temperature dis-
tribution in the calcination region was uniform, but there was a gradient
within each particle. Particles in the inner cooling region had longer
residence times, resulting in higher calcination degrees.

A recent study proposed coupling the Calcium-looping (CaL) process
with a concentrated solar power (CSP) system for thermal energy stor-
age, utilizing calcination and carbonation reactions [378]. A numerical
investigation was conducted on the thermochemical heat storage ca-
pabilities of fluidized black CaCO3 pellets in a CaL-CSP system (Fig. 36).
By integrating experimentally derived kinetic and solar absorptance
properties specific to the pellets, the study assessed the impact of gas
velocity and irradiative flux on heat storage performance within a flu-
idized bed. The results showed that peak solar-chemical efficiency
exceeded 43 %, attributed to improved solar absorptance, higher gas
velocity, and increased irradiative flux.

3.5.3. Discussion

MSW incineration is typically carried out in grate firing systems,
where a conveyor transports non-spherical solid fuels from the feeding

port to the exit. The CFD-DEM simulation of MSW incineration faces
challenges such as the non-spherical shapes of particles and the move-
ment of internal components. Therefore, future research should focus on
two aspects: (i) incorporating the glued-sphere model or super-quadric
model to accurately represent non-spherical solid wastes, and (ii) inte-
grating the dynamic mesh model into the CFD-DEM framework to
accurately capture the movement of internal components.

Calcination and carbonation processes are commonly performed in
shaft kilns or fluidized beds, such as an integrated CaL-CSP system.
When simulating calcination and carbonation using CFD-DEM, addi-
tional attention should be given to the development of a radiation model
that accurately describes the heat and mass transfer resulting from the
solar energy heat source.

3.6. Other industrial processes

This section presents CFD-DEM modelling of some other industrial
processes, including coating and leaching, silicon production, tungsten
oxide reduction, and ice melting (Table S12 of Supplementary
Materials).

3.6.1. Coating and leaching

Particle coating is widely used in industries such as pharmaceuticals,
food, cosmetics, and fertilizers for its ability to modify particle surfaces,
regulate release rates of active ingredients, and protect particles from
external
factors like air, moisture, and light. Fluidized beds are
commonly employed in this process due to their effectiveness in coating
particles.

A chemical vapour deposition (CVD) model was integrated with the
CFD-DEM method in the Fluent-EDEM platform to simulate the depo-
sition process, considering particle movement, adhesion, and deposition
[379]. Higher gas inlet velocity and bed temperature increased the
reduced coating efficiency due to reaction
deposition rate but

constraints. The integrated model was validated in a study [380] where
both homogeneous and heterogeneous deposition mechanisms were
described. A chemical reaction flow model further investigated the
deposition process [381], considering factors such as substance
decomposition, adhesion, and hydrogen inhibition. The model achieved
(cid:0) 4 mg/s at 11 m/s gas velocity and
an average CVD rate of 6.06 Ã 10
1273 K bed temperature, with improved rates and efficiency upon
increasing temperature and reducing hydrogen injection. A recent study
integrated a Monte Carlo method into the CFD-DEM framework to
analyze the particle coating process in a Wurst fluidized bed, consid-
ering gas-solid flow dynamics and the deposition, drying, and solidifi-
cation of droplets on particles [382]. The spherical centroidal Voronoi
tessellation (CVT) model simulated droplet deposition and splashing,
accounting for capillary forces on coating and agglomeration (Fig. 37).
This model enabled analysis of residence time distribution, coating
coverage, porosity, and layer thickness at both intra- and inter-particle
levels. In contrast, the discrete droplet model (DDM) was used to
investigate spray coating in a laboratory-scale Wurster coater. The study
found that the residence time distribution (RTD) of particles in the spray
zone accurately reflected the final particle size distribution, with coating
quality independent of particle shape.

The coarse-grained CFD-DEM method was recently extended to
include mass transfer and spray deposition models for investigating the
spray coating process in a top-spray fluidized bed coater [198]. This
approach accounted for droplet drying and radiation effects. For cohe-
sive particulate systems, a coarse-grained ratio of up to 5 was found to be
effective,
led to inaccurate modelling of
particle-wall interactions. A subsequent study analyzed the Wurster
coating process [383], highlighting two key mechanisms: (i) evapora-
tion of multicomponent spray liquids and (ii) quantifying losses from
spray drying. Another study [384] focused on heat convection, liquid
spraying, and evaporation in a Wurster fluidized bed, identifying three
distinct particle drying modes. To prevent over-spraying, vertical

though higher

ratios

humidity probes in the annulus region were recommended.

In conjunction with the coating process, a coarse-grained CFD-DEM
method was applied to investigate the scale-up effects on the extraction
of valuable rare-earth elements from coal byproducts in a 3D liquid-solid
fluidized system [385]. The leaching reaction between rare earth ore
and magnesium sulphate was formulated as follows:

{Al4[Si4O10](OH)

â 2nRE3+

(f) â {Al4[Si4O10](OH)

}(cid:0)
m

â 3nMg2+
(f)

(R13)

where s and f represent the solid phase and fluid phase, respectively. The
reaction was described as an inner diffusion-controlled shrinking model
[386]. The coarse-grained CFD-DEM method offers computational
speeds similar to those of the less accurate MP-PIC method, showing the
potential as an efficient tool for tackling large-scale industrial problems.
With an increase in solid residence time and a decrease in the
liquid-to-solid mass ratio, the concentration of rare-earth elements in
the liquid solution exhibited a corresponding increase. This observation
highlights the influence of these operational factors on the leaching

process and underscores the potential for optimizing these parameters to
enhance the efficiency of rare-earth element extraction.

A thin diffusion layer model was incorporated to capture the con-
version effects on particle surfaces, based on the same reaction kinetics
[387]. A liquid-solid leaching reactor with a mixing impeller was
simulated to predict leaching efficiency under varying impeller speeds
and particle sizes. The results indicated that incomplete mixing caused
solute depletion, reducing leaching efficiency, while the packed-particle
zone hindered species transport from the bulk solution. Incorporating
draft plates into a spout fluidized bed allowed for both co-current
(wetting) and counter-current (drying) contact regions to occur simul-
taneously, creating a unique characteristic [388]. Recently, experiments
and numerical simulations were combined to optimize silver recovery
from end-of-life crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells in continu-
ously stirred tank reactors. A CFD-DEM particle-scale model, coupled
with a kinetics model, was developed and validated, revealing the hy-
drodynamic mechanisms of silver leaching and guiding the design of an
improved continuously stirred tank reactors system for enhanced silver
recovery efficiency [389].

3.6.2. Silicon production

3.6.3. Tungsten oxide reduction

Photovoltaic cells represent a critical component of solar energy
utilization systems, with the most widely used material being high-
quality silicon (99.999999 %). Polycrystalline silicon production
serves as the initial step in wafer fabrication for these cells. Chemical
vapour deposition from precursors, such as trichlorosilane SiHCl3 (TCS)
and monosilane, silane SiH4 has been the preferred method for poly-
silicon production. During this process,
the precursor undergoes
decomposition from silane and reacts with hydrogen under TCS condi-
tions, with the resulting silicon products deposited onto the starting
substrate surface to obtain high-purity polysilicon. This chemical reac-
tion primarily occurs within a fluidized bed reactor that possesses robust
heat and mass transfer properties, making it ideally suited for chemical
vapour deposition. The overall chemical reactions can be represented as:

SiH4 â Si + 2H2

(R14)

Silicon production by chemical vapour deposition in a 3D spout
fluidized bed reactor was studied by an in-house code [390]. In the
studied process, the precursor gas underwent decomposition on the
particle surface through a heterogeneous reaction, resulting in the for-
mation of the desired solid silicon product. Additionally, a homogeneous
reaction occurred, leading to the production of fine particles that were
not suitable for further processing. The proposed integrated model
considered both the heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions, as well
as heat transfer. The dynamics of gas-solid interactions, along with heat
and mass transfer, were thoroughly analyzed, with a particular focus on
silicon deposition. These findings have important implications for the
design and scale-up of chemical vapour deposition reactors, offering
valuable insights for further research in this field.

Tungsten is commonly separated via a reduction process from its
bounded nonmetals, which has been applied in a variety of industrial
applications in the form of tungsten carbic due to its high strength,
hardness, and toughness. During the sintering of tungsten carbic, the
particle size will increase in a stepwise fashion because the small particle
dissolves and the large particle grows. It is of significance to investigate
and reduce the particle size distribution of metallic tungsten. Tungsten
oxide (WO3) is commonly reduced with hydrogen:

4WO3 + 3H2 â 4W + 6HO2

(R15)

The oxygen in the WO3 is removed by H2 and finally forms into water
vapour, giving rise to high-purity Tungsten.

The reduction of tungsten oxide with hydrogen was simulated
recently [391]. The reduction of tungsten oxide with dry hydrogen was
described by a direct oxygen removal from the solid oxide mechanism
and the DEM was used to describe temperature and reaction progress.
The temperature and species transport inside each particle were
modelled by an intra-particle transport model. The model has been
successfully validated using experimental data related to species mass
fraction. The findings have significant implications for optimizing and
enhancing the process, both in terms of design and operation.

3.6.4. Uranium tetrafluoride fluorination

Uranium hexafluoride (UF6) plays a crucial role in the nuclear fuel
cycle, and various methods have been proposed for its production. These
include fluorinating uranium compounds (such as UF4, UO2, UO3, and
U3O8) using halogen fluorides [392], as well as fluorinating uranium
dioxide in plasma reactors [393]. However, the most widely utilized
method in industrial production remains the fluorination of UF4 using F2

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience109(2025)10122146

S. Wang and Y. Shen

[394]. This process involves the use of high-purity UF4 as the primary
raw material, which is then fluorinated within a spouted bed reactor.
The resulting gas is subsequently separated and purified to yield
high-purity UF6. The fluorination reaction between UF4 and F2 is a
representative non-catalytic gas-solid reaction and can be expressed as:

UF4 + F2 â UF6 ÎH773K = (cid:0) 225.8 kJ/mol

(R16)

Under the conditions of excessive fluorine gas, stable particle fluidiza-
tion, and a constant UF6 collection frequency, it can be inferred that
when the reaction temperature falls within the range of 643 Kâ763 K,
the direct fluorination of UF4 to UF6 takes place without the formation of
any intermediary products [395].

A reactive CFD-DEM framework incorporating a particle-shrinking
reaction model with discretized surfaces was proposed to study the
fluoridation of UF4 [396]. The reaction rate was influenced by temper-
ature, fluorine concentration, gas diffusion, and particle properties. A
non-catalytic gas-solid reaction rate was described using an
Arrhenius-like correlation, without accounting for internal and external
gas diffusion [395]. The reaction rate depends on the collective surface
area of the solid-phase reactants, which provides adsorption sites for
gas-phase reactants. To improve accuracy, the gaseous reactant con-
centration near particles was determined by integrating contributions
from different grid cells based on particle surface area using a scatter
method (Fig. 38).

The particle shrinking rate can be expressed by:

where rp, W, A0, E0, Rf, and Ti are the particle diameter, the molar mass
of solid reactant, pre-exponential factor, activation energy, ideal gas
constant, and particle temperature, respectively. The integrated model
was utilized to simulate the UF4 fluorination process under various
operational conditions within a spouted bed reactor. The results indi-
cated that the superficial gas velocity, varying from 1.14 to 2.06 m/s,
had an insignificant impact on the reaction rate of UF4 fluorination. A
higher superficial gas velocity was found to lead to a lower fluorine
conversion rate.

3.6.5. Solid melting

The process of ice melting involves a phase change from solid ice to

liquid water, accompanied by heat absorption. To address this phe-
nomenon, the mass transfer mechanism described as a shrinking core
model was incorporated into the CFD-DEM framework [397]. The par-
ticle shape was assumed to remain constant during melting. Neglecting
the liquid bridge force between the discharged melt and particles, the
thermophysical properties of the fluid were maintained at a constant
value. The integrated model was first validated for a single ice particle
melting suspended in flowing water under the influence of forced con-
vection (Fig. 39). The model was subsequently employed to investigate
the melting process in a packed bed comprised of multiple ice particles.
The diameter of particles exposed to the warm water is reduced more
quickly than that of particles located in the upper corners. The packed
bed will be removed if the input energy is high enough to melt all
particles.

Similar to the ice-melting process,

the soluble NaCl particles
conveyed in brine were studied [62]. Several convective mass transfer
correlations expressed by the Sherwood number were implemented and
compared with the experimental data. The suitability of Archimedes-
and Reynolds-based models for the Sherwood number was demon-
strated. However,
the 1D model showed poor performance with
Reynolds-based models but performed well with Archimedes-based
models, as indicated by the relative deviation. To ensure the accuracy
of the proposed model, it is recommended to carefully measure all
relevant boundary conditions during calibration. Among these factors,
the PSD, thermophysical properties of the fluid, particle volume frac-
tion, particle and fluid velocities, and particle mechanical properties are
of importance. In a notable study [398], a pioneering modelling
approach coupled with the CFD-DEM framework was developed for
plastic melting. This approach allows for the simultaneous consideration
of solids and melt transport, as well as the formation of melt by
employing a volume of fluid (VOF) model. The integration of
CFD-DEM-VOF offers a promising methodology to tackle the discrete
particles accompanied by phase change. However, it should be noted
that this particular research area remains considerably challenging and
has been scarcely addressed in the existing literature.

3.6.6. Discussion

Recent CFD-DEM simulations of the coating process have focused on
improving final product quality, including coating coverage, porosity
uniformity, and layer thickness distribution, by controlling particle RTD
in reactor zones. The coating process involves complex physics such as

particle dynamics, particle-spray droplet interactions, heat and mass
transfer, and cohesion effects. Future research should prioritize: (a)
improving model accuracy by addressing intra-particle and inter-
particle interactions, (b) mitigating information loss in flow dynamics
and particle behaviour at high coarse-grained levels, and (c) expanding
the model to accommodate polydisperse and non-spherical particles,
enhancing its versatility.

The CFD-DEM simulations of Silicon production and Tungsten oxide
reduction are currently in the developmental stage, and further para-
metric studies are required to enhance process control. In the case of the
melting process, which involves phase change, it is necessary to incor-
porate a VOF model and interface capture algorithms into the CFD-DEM
framework. This integrated approach is anticipated to have potential
applications
in modelling laser powder bed fusion in additive
manufacturing and iron ore melting in the cohesive zones of blast fur-
naces. These advancements will contribute to a better understanding
and optimization of these processes, ultimately leading to improved
efficiency and quality in their respective industries.

4. Challenges and outlook

The aforementioned endeavours demonstrate the considerable po-
tential of utilizing the CFD-DEM method to investigate dense gas-solid
reacting systems. This approach effectively establishes a comprehen-
sive connection between macro-scale and micro-scale properties, facil-
itating an in-depth understanding of the thermochemical conversion of
solid fuels and gaseous agents. Within the realm of multi-physics pro-
cesses, dense gas-solid reacting flow entails the interplay of solid fuels,
combustion, and turbulence, as depicted in Fig. 40. Notably, these fac-
tors exhibit significant interconnections, thereby necessitating thorough
examination and analysis:

(a) Solid fuels are reactants for the burning flame while combustion

provides heat for the reaction of the solid fuels.

(b) Solid fuels affect the fluctuation and modulation of turbulence
while turbulence influences thermochemical conversion at the
gas-solid interface such as surface reactions of the solid fuels.
(c) Combustion changes turbulence intensity via thermal expansion
while turbulence changes the front structure of the burning
flame.

Although numerous studies about such complex relationships of
solid fuels, combustion, and turbulence for gas-reacting flow or dilute
gas-solid reacting flow (e.g., pulverized coal combustion) have been
reported, their intrinsic relationships in dense gas-solid reacting flow
have not been clarified until now. Reasons lie in the significant challenge
of CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow, that is, multi-
scale characteristics both in space and time. The spatial scale of chem-

(cid:0) 1â102 m). In the conventional CFD-DEM
and apparatus length (10
method, the grid size should be 3â5 times of particle diameter for the
PCM scheme [103,399]. If the particle diameter (e.g., 1 mm for biomass
particle) is specified, the grid size (i.e., 3â5 mm) will be fixed to ensure
numerical stability. Such coarse grids cannot resolve flame thickness
and turbulence. If we refine the grids, the voidage approaching 0 will
cause singularity of governing equations and numerical instability of the
interpolation between the discrete phase and continuum phase. The
strong relationship between grid size and particle diameter does not
only limit the CFD-DEM to resolve chemical reaction zones and turbu-
lence on a small scale but also limits it to describe large-scale chemical
engineering apparatuses due to the correspondingly numerous grids.
Hence, most studies regarding CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid
reacting flow concentrate on the thermochemical conversion of solid
fuels without combustion flame and turbulence considered.

reactions covers all time ranges. Hence, the integration time step for the
equations of gas and solid phases is limited. The particle time step is
determined by the Rayleigh number which is related to particlesâ
properties while the fluid time step is limited by the Courant number
which should be smaller than 0.5 to guarantee the numerical conver-
gence of coupled pressure-velocity equations. These conditions are
applied when treating equations in terms of gas phase and solid phases
separately. When solving equations coupling between these two phases,
the particle time step and fluid time step are respectively imposed by
particle response time and fluid response time to ensure numerical sta-
bility and prevent the lagged integration of equations of particle motion.
In practice, the particle time step is commonly chosen two orders of
magnitude smaller than the fluid time step. If the time step is small
enough to resolve inter-particle and inter-phase interactions,
the
computational expense is unaffordable. If the time step is large enough,
numerical stability cannot be achieved. Unfortunately, the criteria for
time-step selection in terms of particle phase, gas phase, turbulence, and
combustion in CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow have
not been strictly elucidated in the literature.

limitations,

To address the aforementioned challenges and overcome the
the utilization of CFD-DEM has undergone
inherent
continuous expansion. This approach has demonstrated remarkable
adaptability and robustness in tackling diverse thermochemical phe-
nomena, thereby offering researchers and engineers a valuable tool for
investigating solid processing units. In addition to its practical applica-
tion and extension to various flow scenarios, several promising domains
present opportunities for further methodological development. These
areas include, but are not limited to the following aspects.

4.1. High-efficiency computation

To accurately capture the complex multi-scale structures and pro-
cesses within dense gas-solid reacting systems, 3D simulations are
essential, despite the common use of 2D simulations for computational
efficiency in fluidized bed reactor studies. The advantages of 3D

simulations include [400â402]: (i) more precise predictions of meso-
scale structures, such as bubble evolution, density-induced segregation,
and core-annulus formation, (ii) 2D simulations can overestimate
reactor performance by up to 45 %, and (iii) 2D simulations misrepre-
sent gas residence time due to inaccurate bed expansion and bubble
dynamics, leading to flawed mass transfer predictions. However, fully
3D simulations require significant computational resources, primarily
due to the need for small time steps to capture inter-particle collisions.
To address time consumption, various parallel strategies have been
developed alongside hardware improvements. Distributed-memory
parallelization allows for unlimited processors but faces challenges in
inter-node communication, commonly applied in CFD simulations.
Shared-memory parallelization, often used in DEM simulations, effi-
ciently distributes computational load among processors when memory
capacity is limited. A hybrid of these approaches is recommended for
CFD-DEM simulations. GPUs have been increasingly used for DEM cal-
culations [174,403,404]. Moreover, methods like coarse-grained oper-
ation [121,195] and scaling processes [147,405,406] are expected to see
more frequent use in CFD-DEM modelling. Recently, reduced-order
models (ROMs) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and
Galerkin projection have emerged to accelerate traditional CFD simu-
lations. POD decomposes CFD data into orthogonal spatial modes and
time evolution coefficients, reducing the dimensionality of variables
from grid points to mode coefficients, and significantly improving
computational efficiency. Through Galerkin projection, the ROM equa-
tion is derived by projecting the governing equation onto each orthog-
onal mode, offering mathematical rigour and better generalization.
Yuan et al. [407] developed an intrusive ROM for cold isothermal flu-
idized bed dynamics using POD, reducing computation time to about
25.4 % of traditional CFD. Cizmas et al. [408] improved efficiency by
reducing solid-phase volume fraction and introducing accelerated ROM
methods. Bizon and Continillo [409] created an isothermal ROM for
circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactors, focusing on dynamic behaviour
and simplifying CFB details. To address parameterization issues, they
introduced a penalty method for weak boundary condition imposition,

applying it to chemical reactor ROMs [410]. ROMs show great potential
for efficiently modelling dense gas-solid reacting flows.

5. Summary and conclusion

4.2. Data-driven closure

CFD-DEM is an effective method in describing dense multiphase
reacting flow, which bridges the micro-scale merits of the DNS-DEM and
macro-scale merits of the TFM. It needs closures in terms of drag force,
heat transfer, and species transport. However, the drag force derived
from experiments and DNS results are primarily dependent on the
Reynolds number and local voidage without other flow parameters
considered. The kinetic parameters of the pyrolysis model are obtained
by staying constant without considering the effects of solid fuel types
and heating conditions. These rough correlations used in the current
CFD-DEM result in obvious deviations in the prediction of hydrody-
namics and thermochemical characteristics of dense gas-solid reacting
flow. The prediction accuracy of the drag model was improved using a
trained artificial neural network (ANN) by accounting for the relative
location of the surrounding particles [411]. The sub-grid scale (SGS)
model was corrected to more accurately describe isotropic turbulence
for LES using machine learning approaches [412]. Some researchers
[413â415] obtained a more accurate description of the thermochemical
properties of coal and biomass during devolatilization and combustion
processes using machine learning approaches. The increasing applica-
tion of machine learning approaches poses a promising perspective to
dig and utilize tremendous data produced by fine-resolution methods for
deriving closures for coarse-resolution methods.

4.3. Reaction kinetics simplification

The precise simulation of dense gas-solid reacting flow hinges upon
the utilization of appropriate reaction kinetics. Nevertheless, capturing
the intricacies of solid fuel conversion within reactors proves to be an
exceedingly complex task, given the interconnection of hundreds of
chemical reactions [416]. For example, according to the CRECK
modelling group [417], the full secondary pyrolysis of switchgrass fast
pyrolysis consists of 509 species and 20240 reactions, which makes it
impractical to implement such a size of the full scheme into the
CFD-DEM modelling framework. Moreover, due to limitations in
experimental and analytical methodologies, a comprehensive under-
standing of most reactions, as well as their associated reaction kinetics,
remains elusive. Consequently, practical simulations often resort to
simplifying the reactions into a few global reactions along with their
corresponding kinetics [418,419]. However, it is deemed impractical to
employ single-order or multi-order global reactions to describe the en-
tirety of complex reactions occurring within the reactor. Furthermore,
even for a specific global reaction, various literature sources present
different expressions for the reaction rates. Thus, it becomes imperative
and meaningful to establish a set of generalized reaction rates applicable
to a specific chemical process. Additionally, it is worth noting that most
CFD-DEM simulations of dense gas-solid reacting flow primarily utilize
the Arrhenius law to represent chemical reaction rates, disregarding the
potential interaction between turbulence and combustion. This presents
future research to explore the incorporation of
an avenue for
turbulence-combustion interaction in CFD-DEM simulations of such
systems. In the foreseeable future, advancements in CFD-DEM tech-
niques may lead to the overcoming of the limitations encountered with
respect to grid size and particle diameter ratio. This would enable the
resolution of gas turbulence, which can serve as a basis for exploring the
integration of turbulence models (e.g., LES and RANS models) and
combustion models (e.g., eddy dissipation model (EDM), eddy dissipa-
tion concept (EDC), and framelet model). By doing so, it is expected that
the simulation accuracy regarding combustion and flame phenomena
will be significantly improved.

The CFD-DEM method has achieved significant success in modelling
dense gas-solid reacting flow over the past two decades. In the paper, the
methodology development of the CFD-DEM method and applications in
a variety of chemical engineering processes were reviewed. For meth-
odology development, the sub-models for describing flow dynamics and
thermochemical conversion are explained by introducing corresponding
equations and algorithms. Specifically, the modified RANS turbulence
model via introducing voidage is increasingly applied. The LSD contact
model provides a fast and efficient calculation. The drag model with
polydisperse effects considered should be used. The statistical kernel
mapping method via solving a grid-independence Gaussian-kernel
diffusion equation deals with the situation where the grid size ap-
proaches or is smaller than the particle diameter. An isothermal particle
assumption is employed for particles with small Biot numbers while
temperature gradients inside the particle should be considered for par-
ticles with large Biot numbers. Combustion regimes provide a criterion
for the selection of particle conversion models. Hardware acceleration
techniques (e.g., GPU) and numerical acceleration methods (e.g.,
coarse-grained approach, rCFD method, machine learning techniques)
enhance the speed of CFD-DEM simulations. Additionally, the operator-
splitting approach and ISAT method demonstrate the potential to reduce
computational complexity while preserving accuracy for chemical
reactions.

The CFD-DEM method finds extensive application in various dense
gas-solid reacting systems, with particular emphasis on the thermo-
chemical conversion of biomass and coal, blast furnace ironmaking,
chemical looping combustion, solid waste incineration, and lime shaft
kiln calcination. The overall large-scale structures observed in experi-
ments can be well reproduced. Moreover, the subtle phenomena, such as
shrinkage of the particle, surface reaction on the particle, and thermo-
chemical gradients inside the particle can also be successfully captured.
Taking the intrinsic advantages of the CFD-DEM method at the particle
scale and even sub-particle scale, the corresponding mechanisms related
to dense gas-solid reacting flow have been partially elucidated.

Despite significant progress made in recent years, several challenges
and unresolved issues continue to exist in the realm of CFD-DEM
modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow. One of the critical chal-
lenges pertains to the resolution of multi-scale features that span vast
spatial and temporal scales. This makes it challenging to precisely
identify combustion and turbulence, which are two essential factors in
characterizing dense gas-solid reacting flow, given the coarse resolution
of the CFD-DEM method. Several topics deserve future research. The
efficient algorithms and parallel computation will be further developed
to improve the computational capacity in calculating large-scale appa-
ratuses with numerous particles. Machine learning approaches will be
extensively used to dig and utilize tremendous data produced by fine-
resolution methods
coarse-resolution
for deriving closures
methods. Moreover, it is promising to simplify and generate a set of
general reaction rates for a specific chemical process and finally clarify
the fundamental mechanisms of solid fuels, combustion, and turbulence
interactions in dense gas-solid reacting flow.
