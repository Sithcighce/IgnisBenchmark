Internal combustion in transport vehicles is still one of the biggest contributors to ultrafine particle emissions
which have been proven to have many adverse effects on human health and the environment in general. To
mitigate this problem a variety of particle filters have been developed and along with these filters a whole
range of models aiming to optimise filter performance. This paper reviews a wide variety of particulate filter
models for vehicular emission control and presents the volume of work in a unified and consistent notation.
Particle filtration models are examined with respect to their filtration efficiency, the way they handle particle
deposits within the filter wall, the formation of filter cake and the role of catalytic conversion and the effect
of gaseous emission. Further, the impact of the chemical and physical properties of particulate deposits on
the filter regeneration process is analysed and reaction pathways and rates are presented. In addition the
accumulation of ash deposits and its impact on the filter behaviour is critically reviewed. Finally, various
measures are identified that can potentially improve the current particle filter models.

1. Introduction

1.1. Particulate emissions from engines

Vehicular emission is often the biggest contributor towards ultrafine
particle emissions in urban areas [1]. Particulate matter emitted by
vehicles can have adverse health and environmental impacts [2,3].
There is a great variety in the size, shape and composition of such
particulates [4–6]. The properties of the particulates are influenced
by the fuel composition, engine speed, engine load and combustion
mode of the engine [7–10]. A typical particle size distribution of
particles emitted from an internal combustion engine (ICE) is shown
in Fig. 1. Three size classes may be identified: the nucleation mode
(below 50 nm), the accumulation mode (50 nm to 1 micron) and the
coarse mode (above 1 micron) [11]. The relative proportion of particles
in each mode can vary significantly depending on the engine and its
operating condition [12]. Each particle mode can be approximated
well by a log-normal distribution [13]. The nucleation mode is formed
from nucleation of hydrocarbon and sulphates when the exhaust is
cooled down. The accumulation mode is composed of soot aggregates
formed during the combustion process. They may grow into coarse

mode particles if they deposit on the surface of engine cylinders, which
are re-entrained into the exhaust at a later stage.

The major component of engine-out particles is soot [13]. This
can be loosely defined as hydrocarbon solid substances with an 8:1
carbon-to-hydrogen ratio [14]. It is the product of the inception of
polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fuel-rich regions inside engine
cylinders, where fuel pyrolysis occurs [5,15]. The major steps of soot
formation are shown in Fig. 2. Primary particles formed at the early
stages are approximately spherical [16]. Primary particles can grow
in size via condensation of gaseous species; larger aggregates can be
formed due to the coagulation of smaller primary particles [14,17].
This leads to a fractal-like aggregate structure as shown in Fig. 3. The
morphology of the aggregate may be further modified by oxidation
which can also lead to fragmentation [13].

In addition, inorganic ash may be found in engine-out particu-
lates [18]. This originates from additives doped in the fuel and the
lubricant oil. Ash may be found on the surface of aggregates or is
embedded within the aggregate [19]. In addition, wear and corrosion
can lead to the formation of individual ash particles [20]. ICEs may
also emit liquid condensate and semi-volatile particles as opposed to

solid particles [21]. The semi-volatile particles are often composed of
soluble organic fractions (SOFs) derived from unburnt fuel or lubricant.
Inorganic species such as sulphates and phosphates can also be of
significant quantity depending on the fuel formulation [22].

1.2. Particulate filters

As the negative impacts of particulates were realised, governing
bodies around the world imposed limits on particulate emissions from
ICEs [23]. The application of particulate filer was found to be effective
in controlling engine-out particulate emissions. The Diesel Particulate
Filter (DPF) is now an essential component of diesel engine systems to
comply with emission standards [24]. However, particular filters are
not just relevant to diesel engines, but also to gasoline direct injection
(GDI) engines.

Emission standards have been continuously revised to be more strin-
gent as the understanding of the negative impacts of particulates and
relevant measuring technologies improve [23]. The European Union
(EU) introduced limits on Particle Number (PN) emission in addition
to the Particle Mass (PM) limit in an attempt to reduce emissions of
ultrafine particles [25]. This is because smaller particles may penetrate

the respiratory system more easily than larger particles and are there-
fore more harmful [26]. Effective control of ultrafine particle emission
will become more important as the cut-off particle size for the PN limit
is expected to reduce from 23 nm to 10 nm [27].

In addition to more stringent emission standards, the emission
testing procedure has been improved to minimise differences between
laboratory emission measurements and real emission. Several studies
have indicated that over-simplistic drive cycles, for example, the New
European Drive Cycle (NEDC), can lead to underestimation of real
emissions [28–30]. Drive cycles developed based on data collected from
actual vehicles such as the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test
Cycles (WLTC) were introduced to address this issue [31]. Furthermore,
the development of portable emission measurement systems (PEMS)
has enabled real driving emission (RDE) tests that measure the on-road
emissions from vehicles [32].

The updates of emission standards and testing protocols have been
motivating for wider applications of particulate filters and newer par-
ticulate filter technologies. Gasoline Particulate Filters (GPFs) are be-
coming more popular for GDI engines to comply with the Euro 6 PN
limit [33,34]. Moreover, port fuel injection (PFI) engines may need to
be installed with GPFs in the future as RDE studies have shown that PFIs
can have comparable PN emission to GDI in cold environments [35,36].
The most common structure of particulate filters is the Wall Flow
Monolith (WFM) structure as shown in Fig. 4 [38]. The monolith is
composed of a set of alternately plugged porous walled channels. The
inlet channels are plugged at the rear and the outlet channels are
plugged at the front of the monolith. The engine-out exhaust enters the
filter via the inlet channels and exits through the outlet channels. The
porous wall between inlet and outlet channels traps the particles carried
by the exhaust gas. Particle deposition inside the porous space of the
wall leads to an increase in filtration efficiency but also an increase in
the pressure drop across the filter. As this process continues, further
in-wall particle deposition is prevented by pore closure due to already
deposited particles. As a result, a particle cake layer is formed on the
interface between the inlet channel and the porous wall instead.

Regeneration refers to the process of burning off the trapped par-
ticles. Regeneration is necessary to avoid high filter pressure drop
(and associated fuel penalty) and overfilling of the filter [39]. ‘‘Active
regeneration’’ describes regeneration strategies that require a tempo-
rary change in the operating condition of the filter. Typical active
regeneration increases the filter temperature to promote the oxidation
of trapped particles, usually with O2 as the oxidant. The additional heat
may be provided by post-fuel injection [40], electric heaters [41] or
microwaves [42,43]. It should be noted that ash is incombustible and
therefore remains in the filter after regeneration.

On the contrary, ‘‘passive regeneration’’ occurs spontaneously when-
ever the operating condition is favourable without active control.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)1010432

C.T. Lao et al.

Passive regeneration usually relies on NO2 as the oxidant, since it is
a stronger oxidising agent than O2 which allows particle combustion
to occur at a lower temperature [44]. An oxidation catalyst is needed
to produce NO2 for passive regeneration since engine-out NO2 con-
centration is insufficient [45]. It should be noted that GPFs operate
at different conditions than DPFs and therefore their regeneration
strategies differ significantly. Gasoline exhaust gas is generally at
higher temperatures and has lower oxygen contents than diesel exhaust
gas. Passive regeneration of GPFs with O2 is possible since the exhaust
temperature from gasoline engines is usually higher than that of diesel
engines [46]. Spontaneous regeneration of GPFs can occur during
deceleration, at which point additional air flows through the engine
and provides sufficient O2 for regeneration reactions [47].

DPFs with catalytic coatings i.e. catalysed DPFs (CDPFs) were devel-
oped in order to improve the regeneration performance [48]. Oxidation
catalysts such as Precious Group Metals (PGM) may be coated inside
or on the surface of the porous wall to promote passive regeneration
via in-situ NO2 generation [49,50]. In addition, oxidation catalysts can
increase the reactivity of O2 regeneration and thus lower the ignition
temperature of soot [51]. NOx removal (deNOx) catalysts including lean
NOx trap (LNT) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts can
be coated on DPF walls to reduce the volume of the overall exhaust
after-treatment system [52,53]. Similarly, three way catalysts (TWC)
are often coated on GPFs for the same reason [54].

In contrast to the conventional filter design shown in Fig. 4, alter-
native structures have been developed in order to further improve the
performance of particulate filters [45]. Increasing the cross-sectional
area of inlet channels can increase the particle storage capacity and
achieve lower pressure drop at the same particle loading with respect
to filters with symmetrical channel designs [55,56]. Filters with trian-
gular and hexagonal cross-sections have been studied and they exhibit
different heat and mass transfer behaviour to channels with square
cross-sections [57]. More sophisticated filter designs where channels
may have more than one type of cross-section have also been ex-
plored, for example, the Octo-Square (OS) design [58] and Hexagonal–
Rectangular–Triangular (HRT) design [59]. They have shown better
performance than the traditional design and they are not limited to the
1:1 ratio of inlet and outlet channels [60].

1.3. Particulate filter models

Many particulate filter models have been developed in order to
reduce the cost of the design process and to interpret experimental
results and gain more insight into filter behaviour [48,61–63]. Ade-
quate consideration of phenomena occurring at multiple length scales
is essential for accurate prediction of filter behaviour. Particulate filter
models can be put into three main categories based on the length-scale
of interest, namely pore-scale, channel-scale and monolith-scale [62].
Depending on the length-scale, the balance equations describing mo-
mentum, thermal energy, species, and particle population are solved in
different levels of detail.

Pore-scale models focus on processes happening within individ-
ual pores of the filter wall. A prerequisite of meaningful pore-scale
simulations is to consider ‘‘a sufficiently large domain that contains
statistical representation of the morphological features present in the stud-
ied system’’ [64]. Experimental techniques such as X-ray tomography
(XRT) can be used to provide a detailed three-dimensional topology
of the porous wall as an input to pore-scale models [65,66]. The gas
flow through the porous network can either be solved by Computa-
tional Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches or Lattice Boltzmann Methods
(LBM) [64,67]. The trajectories of individual particles can be solved
by Lagrangian particle tracking [68]. Since the characteristic length
of pore-scale models is O (nm) − O (μm), high spatial resolution is
needed for convergence, and hence pore-scale models are generally
very demanding of computational resources. The Eulerian–Eulerian

approach is often adopted for both the gas phase and particle phase
in order to reduce the computational cost [69].

Channel-scale models focus on the relevant phenomena occurring
at the scale of the channel diameter, O (μm) − O (mm). Single-channel
models consider an inlet channel and an outlet channel of the wall-
flow monolith. In the case of filters with asymmetric channel designs,
channel-scale models should simulate the ‘‘minimum repeating unit’’
of the filter; for example, three hexagonal channels, three rectangular
channels and a triangular channel are needed to be considered for the
HRT filter design [59]. The gas flow and associated heat and mass
transfer may be solved by commercial CFD software packages; this ap-
proach is called the ‘‘3D single-channel model’’. Since the cross-section
of filter channels usually exhibit rotational symmetries, the channel
model may be simplified into 2D or 1D single-channel models [63].
Empirical correlations are often employed to describe convective heat
and mass transfer processes in 1D single-channel models [70]. The
detailed structure of the porous wall is not fully resolved in channel-
scale models. It is usually approximated as an assemble of simple
geometries i.e. the ‘‘cell model’’ [71]. These are discussed in more detail
in the next section.

Monolith-scale models consider an ensemble of multiple inlet and
outlet channels. They are developed to study the impact of inlet maldis-
tribution and interaction between filter channels [63]. The behaviours
of inlet channels may not be identical if they are subjected to differ-
ent inlet conditions. Single-channel models cannot describe the filter
behaviour adequately in these cases. The spatial domain of the filter
model may need to be extended beyond the filter channels in order
to study the flow distribution effect [72]. Monolith-scale models are
generally expensive to solve given the large spatial domain involved.

The choice of model depends on the purpose, expected level of
detail, accuracy required and computational cost limitation of the
particular application. Single-channel models are the most popular in
the scientific literature since they provide a good compromise between
predictive power and computational cost [61]. Pore-scale models are
becoming more popular as designers are interested in optimising the
catalytic coating and microstructure of the porous wall for better
filtration and pollutant conversion [68,73]. Multi-channel models are
valuable in assisting designs of inlet cones as well as investigation of
non-uniform filter behaviour [74].

1.4. Scope

Many balance equations, including those of momentum, thermal
energy, species and particle population need to be solved by filter mod-
els. The process described by these equations can be influenced by the
properties of incoming and deposited particles. Adequate description of
the particle phase is essential for an accurate filter model. This is not
an easy task given the wide range of size, morphology and composition
exhibited by engine-out particulates.

This review seeks to answer the following questions:

1. How have the state and the impact of particles been considered

in existing filter models?

2. What level of detail is needed in order to adequately describe

the impact of particles on filter behaviour?

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Modelling of the
filtration process and the influence of trapped particles on the filter
behaviour are described in Section 2. Filter regeneration models and
the treatment of particle deposit during regeneration are described in
Section 3. The accumulation of incombustible ash deposits and their
impact on the filter behaviour is described in Section 4. Finally, the
review is summarised in Section 5 with suggestions for future work.

2. Modelling particle filtration

The soot deposition process in particulate filters may be divided
into four stages as shown in Fig. 5. The first stage is called the ‘‘deep
bed filtration’’ or ‘‘depth deposition’’ stage where particles are trapped
within the filter wall. As particles deposit within the filter wall, they can
block the pores on the surface of the wall. This forces incoming particles
to build upon the wall surface instead. At first, lumps of particles
are observed over the blocked pores [75]. These are referred to as
‘‘particle trees’’ and this stage is called the ‘‘particle tree growth’’ stage.
The thickness of the cake layer (which is non-uniform at this point)
is increasing most rapidly at this stage [76]. As particle deposition
continues, the particle trees being to grow laterally, where particles are
depositing on the ceramic surface [75]. The thickness of the cake layer
grows more slowly at this ‘‘particle tree connection’’ stage. The soot
cake becomes uniform by the end of the connection stage, at which
point the rate of soot cake thickness growth becomes steady [76]. The
onset soot cake thickness at the beginning of this ‘‘soot cake layer’’ stage
has been found to be between 20–50 μm [75,76].

2.1. Filtration efficiency of clean filters

The filtration process is controlled by the properties of the filter
medium, the particles being filtered and the carrying fluid [77]. The
ideal gas law is commonly used to describe the gaseous exhaust car-
rying engine-out particulates [78–80]. The gas flow across the filter
wall is determined by its tortuous internal pore network which is highly
related to the manufacturing process [81].

The movement of particles may be simulated by solving the La-

grangian equation of motion for the particles [82]

where mp is the mass of a particle, vp is the vector of particle velocity
and ∑ F is the resultant force acting on the particle, which includes a
drag force that opposes the motion of the particle, a Brownian motion
force that causes random movement of the particle, and a gravitational
force that pulls the particle towards the Earth. These forces can affect
the filtration efficiency of a particle by affecting its movement and
hence the probability of a collision between the particle and the fil-
tering medium. The contributions to the force from drag and Brownian
motion are usually considered [67], whereas gravitational force can be
ignored for engine-out particulates [82].

Eq. (1) may be called the Langevin equation when the Brown-
ian diffusion force is included [67]. The thermophoretic force may
be included as a deterministic term in Eq. (1) as shown by Matte-
Deschênes et al. [86], but its contribution is only significant when
extreme temperature gradient occurs, which is rarely seen in practical
devices. Pore-scale models often assume particles are trapped once they
make contact with the filter wall with 100% efficiency [68,86]. This
is generally true except for sub−10 nm particles which can bounce off
from the wall surface due to the high kinetic energy-to-mass ratio [87].
Solving for the particle mass concentration is an alternative to
solving Eq. (1) in order to reduce computational demand [73,88,89].
The local mass fraction of trapped particles is given by the following

is the mass fraction of soot particles in the solid phase
at position x and time t. fC,g is the distribution function of soot mass
fraction in the LBM model. The sum of all fC,g gives the soot mass
fraction in the gas phase. The deposition probability pD determines the
number of particles trapped when they flow through a filtering node.
Particles that are not trapped will bounce back into the gas flow [89].
The deposition probability is calibrated based on experimental data and
treated as a constant [73].

In channel-scale models, particles are usually assumed to distribute
homogeneously in the carrying gas and follow the streamlines of the
gas [80,91]. The ‘‘unit-cell’’ approach is commonly used to describe
the filtration process in channel-scale particulate filter models [61,69].
The complex internal structures of the filter wall are represented by
an ensemble of particle ‘‘collectors’’ with simple geometry e.g. spheres
(for extruded ceramic filters) or cylinders (for fibrous filters) [92,93].
The diameter of a spherical collector dc can be estimated from the pore
diameter dpore and the porosity of the filter wall εw. The pore diameter is
defined as a hydraulic diameter i.e. the diameter of a sphere conserving
the wet surface area and the void volume of the filter wall [77,84]:

The rest of this paper only considers models for filter walls with
homogeneous microstructure i.e. uniform pore size and porosity ev-
erywhere within the filter wall. Real filter wall substrates can be
highly non-uniform with great local variations of both porosity and
pore size [94,95]. The readers are recommended to read publications

where E is the instantaneous filtration efficiency, η is the collection

ness of the filter medium. The sticking coefficient CS is an empirical
parameter introduced to calibrate the single collector efficiency η to fit
against experimental data [99], although it is frequently assumed to be
1. The instantaneous filtration efficiency of a filter wall with a fibrous
structure can be calculated as [100]

where df
is the diameter of a fibre. In some modelling works, the
effective thickness of the filter medium w in Eqs. (10) and (11) may
not be the actual thickness of the entire medium. It has been observed
in experiments that soot particles only penetrate filter walls superfi-
cially [101]. A filter wall may be divided into two layers in general,
where the top layer facing the inlet channel is responsible for soot
filtration and the bottom layer is effectively clean (traps no particles).
For example, Serrano et al. [99] assumed that filtration only occurs
in the top 2% to 10% of the filter wall.
In such models, the filtration
process is omitted in the remainder of the filter medium. This modelling
approach will be called the ‘‘two-layer’’ approach in the rest of this
paper.

The gas flow around a single collector or fibre can be described
analytically by the Kuwabara and Happel models [77]. These two
models assume different boundary conditions at the surface of the
collector. the Happel model assumes that the tangential stress vanishes
at fluid–solid boundary whereas the Kuwabara model assumes that the
vorticity vanishes [93]. The filtration efficiency of a single collector via
a specific filtration mechanism can then be derived. The three major
filtration mechanisms, namely Brownian diffusion, interception and
inertial impaction, are shown in Fig. 6. The influences of gravitational
forces and thermophoresis are neglected in the unit collector model.

Brownian diffusion considers particle deposition onto the collector
due to random collision with gas molecules. Interception considers
particles that are trapped on the collectors because they follow along
gas streamlines that lie closely to the surface of collectors [102]. Inertial
impaction considers the filtration of particles that are too large to
follow the streamlines that cannot change direction fast enough to
avoid colliding with the collector.

Various expressions of the single collector efficiencies for each
filtration mechanism have been presented by different authors in the lit-
erature. A general expression for diffusional single collector efficiency
ηB is

where C1 and C2 are numerical coefficients. The Kuwabara function

and the Peclet number Pe is

(14)

where v is the gas velocity and Dp is the particle diffusion coefficient
calculated as per Eq. (7). It should be noted that the particle flow
across the filter wall is perpendicular to the gas flow in channel as
shown in Fig. 7. Consequently, unit collector models are essentially
one-dimensional, and hence all velocities mentioned here and below
are also one-dimensional, in the direction of the particle flow.

Literature models for diffusional filtration differ in the following

aspects:

According to the derivation by Lee and Gieseke [97], C1 = 2

≈ 3.5. Most existing models adopted the approximate value of 3.5
whilst Gong and Rutland [77] has used the exact value. An additional
empirical multiplier was introduced by Karamitros and Koltsakis [80]
in order to adjust the value of the collector efficiency to capture the
behaviours of different substrate materials. The index of the Peclet
number C2 is usually − 2
[99,103,104]. Recent studies have shown that

is better suited for non-spherical collectors [105].

The Peclet number may be defined by either the superficial velocity
U which is the through-wall gas velocity at the face of the filter wall,
or the interstitial velocity u which is the actual gas velocity within the
pores. They are related by

u =

U
ε

.

(15)

Both definitions are used in the literature. Gong and Rutland [77],
Liu et al. [106] and Tan et al. [107] all used superficial velocity
whereas Konstandopoulos et al. [38], Serrano et al. [108] and Payri
et al. [103] used interstitial velocity. Since the original formulation
developed by Lee and Gieseke [97] defined the Peclet number using the
velocity at the boundary of the collectors, it may be more appropriate

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)1010435

C.T. Lao et al.

to define the Peclet number using the interstitial velocity for diffusional
filtration. Using different definitions can lead to a factor of 2 difference
in the value of ηB because the typical porosities of particulate filters are
around 50% [109].

The correction for slip phenomena (Eqs. (3) and (7)) requires the
Knudsen number to be calculated (Eq. (4)). Whilst most literature mod-
els have used the particle diameter to define the Knudsen number, Payri
et al. [84] used the pore diameter of the filter wall as the relevant
length scale for the slip phenomena. This practice is adopted by fol-
lowing modelling works [99,103,104,107,108]. Since the diffusion of
the particle is due to random collisions with gas molecules, the relevant
interface when slip occurs would be the surface of the particle. Hence
the particle diameter should be used in slip correction calculation.

where the Cunningham correction factor Cc is calculated based on

This is thought to be more appropriate as the interstitial velocity would
be the actual gas velocity ‘‘experienced’’ by the particle. The use of
interstitial velocity also incorporates the influence of filter wall porosity
into the inertial filtration efficiency expression.

Significantly fewer modelling works have considered particulate
filters with fibrous walls. The following expression was used by Wang
et al. [93] and Liu et al. [106] for diffusional single fibre efficiency ηBf

The interception exponent s = 3−2ε
is sometimes approximated to
3ε
be 2 [77], which implies ε ≈ 3
(lower end of typical wall poros-
8
ity [109]). Karamitros and Koltsakis [80] introduced an additional
empirical multiplier to ηR in their model, similar to their treatment for
ηB to account for different substrate materials.

An alternative formulation for interceptional single collector effi-
ciency was proposed by Wurzenberger et al. [110]. The authors adapted
expressions from Ohara et al. [102] (who only presented expressions
for single collector efficiencies for the limiting cases Re → 0 and
Re → ∞) and obtained the following expression based on fitting against
experimental data

ηR = 1.5NR + 10−7N 2
R.

(18)

This formulation does not consider the impact of the filter medium
porosity. As a result, Eq. (18) is expected to only work for highly porous
filter media with collectors that are far from each other and can be
approximated to be isolated.

Inertial impaction is often neglected in filtration models for par-
ticulate filters. Jiang et al. [111] showed that inertial impaction can
be neglected for particles below 1 μm. This means that the inertial
impaction is only relevant for coarse mode particles which are a minor
fraction of engine-out particulates. However, Liu et al. [106] suggested
that inertial impaction is non-negligible due to the low porosities of
ceramic filters. Gong and Rutland [77] used the following expression
for single collector efficiency due to inertial impaction

ηI =

for moderate St. Brown [100] described scenarios of low and high
Stokes numbers without stating the exact ranges of low, moderate and
high Stokes numbers. The inertia of the particle can cause a slight
perturbation on the particle’s trajectory and affect the interception
efficiency at low Stokes numbers. When the Stokes number is large,
the trajectory of the particle is almost a straight line. Babaie Rabiee
et al. [82] applied Eqs. (33) and (34) for 0.01 ≤ St ≤ 10 without further
clarification.

2.1.3. Combining different filtration mechanisms

In order to calculate the instantaneous filtration efficiency using
Eqs. (10) or (11), the overall single collector (fibre) efficiency needs
to be calculated by combining the single collector (fibre) efficiencies
due to each filtration mechanism. Most filter models in the literature
assume each filtration mechanism acts independently; this is adopted
owing to mathematical difficulties [77]. Ou et al. [112] considered the
enhancement of interception due to Brownian motion, where particles
that would not have been trapped by pure interception are filtered be-
cause they are ‘‘pushed’’ towards the collector surface due to Brownian
motion. The additional single fibre efficiency ηBRf is

ηBRf =

1.24N
√

2
3
Rf
Kf Pe

.

(35)

Many authors have combined single collector (fibre) efficiencies by

treating them as probabilities [103,104,110,114], for example [108]

η = 1 −

(
1 − ηB

) (

1 − ηR

) (

1 − ηI

) .

(36)

However, it can be seen from the equations above that the ex-
pressions used to describe the single collector (fibre) efficiencies (Eqs.
(12), (16), (25) etc.) are not bounded between 0 and 1. As a result,
applying the independence rule of probabilities may yield unphysical
values for the overall single collector efficiency. According to the early
work of Lee and Gieseke [97], the diffusional single collector efficiency
was defined as ‘‘ the ratio of the rate at which particles diffuse to the
sphere surface to that at which particles approach toward the sphere surface
within the cross-sectional area of the sphere’’. A simple additive rule
may be more suitable for combining single collector efficiencies since
they are not probabilities by definition, but rates of particle collection
normalised by the rate of particle approaching collectors.

Some authors introduced additional multipliers to single collector
efficiencies to consider the interaction between the particles and the
filter wall. Wang et al. [71] introduced calibrating constants to single
collector efficiencies for diffusion ηB and interception ηR respectively.
The authors suggested that the introduction of these constants allows
the model to account for the effect of the pore morphology of the filter
wall.

The size of a particle is characterised by its diameter in filtra-
tion models. Treating particles as spheres in filter models is the most
straightforward approach [115]. However, engine-out particulates of-
ten are fractal-like aggregates. To overcome this problem, real particles

may be treated as spheres in the model with equivalent particle di-
ameter and density [67]. Viswanathan et al. [116] found that the
mobility diameter is the determining parameter for filtration behaviour.
Additional consideration of the shape of the particle is unnecessary
since it is a function of the mobility diameter. The mobility diameter
dmob of engine-out aggregates may be measured using a differential
mobility analyser (DMA). It may be estimated if the number npri and the
diameter dpri of primary particles within the aggregate are known [117]

dmob ∝ dprin

1
Dmm
pri

,

(37)

where Dmm is the mass-mobility exponent. The value of Dmm depends
on the flow regimes as well as the number of primary particles within
the aggregate [117].

There are concerns about whether the mobility diameter is the
correct length scale for all filtration mechanisms. A study conducted
by Chen et al. [118] on particle filtration of a nuclepore filter suggested
that the maximum projected length of the particle should be used
to calculate the interceptional filtration efficiency to account for the
elongated shape of aggregates. This approach is adopted in the work
of Tan et al. [104] on DPFs. In their work, the maximum diameter
is calculated using an empirical correlation considering the engine
operating conditions.

In addition to the size of the particles, it is also important to describe
the mass of the particles since it will affect the effect of forces acting
upon the particles (in particle tracking schemes) and the mass-based
filtration efficiency which is a common metric used in emission stan-
dards. The material density of engine-out particles have been reported
or assumed to be in the range of 1500–2500 kg/m3 [44,68,91,111,119–
122]. The mass of the particle can then be calculated if the number and
the diameter of primary particles are also known.

As mentioned above, most filtration models treat aggregates as
spherical particles with equivalent mobility diameters. Hence the ef-
fective density of a particle is required to correctly calculate the mass
of a particle. The effective density of aggregates is usually described as
a power-law relationship [104,121,123]

ρef f = Cρpri

( dmob
dpri

)q−3

.

(38)

where C is a constant and q is fractal dimension according to Gong et al.
[123] and mass-mobility exponent according to Liu et al. [121] and Tan
et al. [104]. Since the effective density is a function of the mobility
diameter, defining q as the fractal dimension will be inappropriate since
it is a pure geometric parameter [117]. Other empirical formulas to
relate the effective density and the size of aggregates have been used
in the literature [67,123].

2.2. Particle deposition within filter walls

The void volume within the filter wall reduces as particles are
trapped in the filter wall. This can influence the instantaneous filtration
performance [95] and generally leads to an increase in both filtration
efficiency and pressure drop [38,124].

In pore-scale models, the deposition of particles can be captured by
redefining the ‘‘wall’’ region. For example, Yamamoto and Sakai [125]
tracked the local particle mass concentration within the filter wall. As
it reaches unity, the local node is considered as a solid phase instead of
the gas phase. An additional frictional force is applied to the gas flow
in the solid region (since soot deposits are porous) [126]. This then has
a subsequent impact on the gas flow pattern and the pressure drop.

2.2.1. Spherical unit collector model

In channel-scale models coupled with the spherical unit collector
model, the build-up of particles within the filter wall is reflected by an
increase in the collector size. The diameter of the collector dc is often
treated as a function of the mass of trapped particles [107,110]

dc = 2

[

(39)

where dc0 is the collector diameter without any trapped particles, msw
is the mass of particle deposits and ρsw is the packing density of particle
deposits within the filter wall. The packing density ρsw is calibrated to
match experimental pressure drop data [127]. Konstandopoulos et al.
[128] showed that the value of this parameter may scale with the local
Peclet number.

As the diameter of the collector increases, the filtration efficiency of
the wall changes according to equations presented in Section 2.1. The
local wall porosity εw which is another important input for the filtration
model can be calculated from the local collector diameter

εw = 1 −

(
1 − εw0

( dc

(40)

where the subscript 0 denotes clean wall condition.

The corresponding pressure drop across the filter wall in a channel-

scale model can be generally described as [129,130]

ΔP =

μw
κ

v + βρgwv2,

(41)

where ΔP is the pressure drop, w is the thickness of the porous
medium (wall), κ is the permeability of the porous medium (wall), ρg
is the gas density and β is the Forchheimer coefficient of the porous
medium (wall). The first-order term on the right-hand side represents
the viscous loss and the second-order term on the right-hand side rep-
resents the inertial loss [131]. The permeability κ and the Forchheimer
coefficient β can be calibrated based on experimental pressure drop
data measured at various flow rates [131].

The Forchheimer coefficient of a porous medium can be derived

from Ergun’s equation [130]

β =

1.75

.

(42)

The inertial momentum loss across porous media is often omitted
in filter models due to low wall Reynolds number [69,79,132], albeit
some experiments has shown that it has a non-negligible impact [133].
As particles deposit within the filter wall, its permeability (κ in
Eq. (41)) will reduce and hence lead to an increase in pressure drop.
The unit collector model calculates the permeability of the clogged wall
κw from the local porosity εw and collector diameter dc [127]

where ρp is defined as the ratio of the mass of the particles to the pore

2.2.2. The two-layer approach

In channel-scale models, the filter wall is divided into slabs with
each slab having a local collector size in order to reproduce the particle
deposition profile across the wall [38]. In the work of Serrano et al.
[99], the porous wall was divided into two slabs. Only the top slab
that is adjacent to the inlet channel is responsible for particle filtra-
tion whereas the remainder of the porous wall is always clean. This
approach is based on the experimental observation that only superficial
soot penetration occurs in the filter wall [101]. Whilst this ‘‘two-layer’’
approach is able to reproduce the pressure drop trend during the fil-
tration process, its performance deteriorates significantly for scenarios
that are not considered during calibration. Furthermore, the thickness
of the top slab i.e. the soot penetration thickness is an input to the
filtration model. The penetration thickness may be estimated using a
correlation between the soot penetration thickness and the wall Peclet
number [99].

All collectors within the top slab are assumed to behave identically
in the ‘‘two-layer’’ model. Serrano et al. [138] introduced a multiplier
called ‘‘shape factor’’ to account for irregular (non-spherical) increase
of the collector size. Eq. (39) then becomes [103]

where ρef f is the effective density of individual aggregates described
in Section 2.1. Serrano et al. [138] suggested that its value should be
345 kg/m3 to represent aggregates with medium fractal dimension and
number of primary particles. The shape factor χ is bounded between
0 and 1, where a value of 1 represents the perfect spherical growth of
the collector. The shape factor χ was found to increase with the soot
load and is defined as [103]
χ = C1Φ−C2

(48)

where Φsoot
is a ‘‘soot density factor’’ and C1, and C2 are fitting
coefficients. Their values were found to be C1 = 2.3136 and C2 = 0.864
by Serrano et al. [138] after calibration against experimental results.
The soot density factor is defined as ‘‘the ratio between the soot packing
density inside the porous wall and the soot mass to soot penetration volume
ratio’’ [138]

It should be noted that some authors have used another version of
Eq. (44) which has a factor of 4 difference from the equation reported
here [38, for example]. This has no impact on Eq. (43) since only the
ratio of Kuwabara functions matters. However, one needs to be careful
about its impact on modelling the permeability of the clogged wall
(see Eq. (52)). The rest of the paper assumes the Kuwabara geometric
function has the form presented above.

The permeability of the porous wall has been observed to change
with temperature [135]. An additional term may be added to Eq. (43)
to account for the change in permeability due to change in the mean
free path of the gas [136]

wall as a layer itself. Since soot deposits are not physically a layer
within the filter wall, the value of κsoot may only be calibrated to match
experimental pressure drop data. It was calibrated to be 9.6 × 10−16 m2
in the work of Zhang et al. [141].

(53)

2.2.4. Summary of in-wall deposition treatment in unit collector models

Three groups of modelling approach for in-wall deposition which
occurs during the deep bed filtration stage have been described above.
The one used by Kamp et al. [139] and Sappok [140] is the only one
with a single degree of freedom (κsoot ). The other two models have two
degrees of freedom. The predictions of the two-layer model developed
by Serrano et al. [99] are controlled by the effective density of individ-
ual aggregates ρef f and the ratio between soot penetration thickness
̂wsat . The filter behaviour predicted by
and the total wall thickness
the standard unit collector model with multiple wall discretisation is
controlled by the packing density of particle deposits within the filter
wall ρsw and the number of discretisations nwall.

As nwall increases, the calibrated value of ρsw is expected to converge
asymptotically. However, the numerical convergence with respect to
nwall has not been studied extensively. Researchers often choose the
value of nwall a priori without justification [136]. One needs to be aware
of this practice and not assume that asymptotic convergence is achieved
without evidence.

On the other hand, the parameters of Serrano et al. [99]’s model
can be experimentally measured. Their model however requires a good
estimation of the penetration thickness of soot deposits as an input,
which is supposed to be the output of the model. This limits the
predictability of the model. Furthermore, the soot deposition profile
within the filter wall cannot be reproduced by Serrano et al. [99]’s
model.

2.2.5. Fibrous filter model

Particles trap in fibrous filters will form dendrites in the wall which
have been shown to act like new fibres [142]. The fibrous filter wall
was discretised into 35 slabs in the work of Wang et al. [93]. Each slab
of the fibrous filter wall was split into two regions, one representing
filter fibres without soot particles whereas the other representing soot
dendrites within the fibrous wall. This is shown in Fig. 8.

Wang et al. [93] incorporated this effect into a model of a filter
composed on metal fibres. The filtration efficiency of the metal fibre
Ef is a variation of Eq. (11)

Ef = 1 − exp

[ −4αf ηf ww
πdf εw

]

,

(54)

where αf is the solid volume fraction of metal fibres, ηf is the single
fibre collection efficiency, ww is the filter wall thickness, df
is the
diameter of metal fibres and εw is the filter wall porosity. Similarly,
the filtration efficiency of the soot dendrites Esd is

Esd = 1 − exp

[ −4αsdηsdww
πdsdεw

]

,

(55)

Fig. 8. The clogged portion and the clean portion of the fibrous filter wall is considered
to form parallel resistance to gas flow across the wall [93].

where subscript ‘‘sd’’ denotes soot dendrite. The single collector effi-
ciency η may be calculated as described in Section 2.1.2 using the
dendrite diameter and metal fibre diameter respectively. The dendrite
diameter was chosen to fit against experimental pressure drop by Wang
et al. [93]. The quality of the model remains to be checked against
experimental observations of the dendrites.

As the metal fibres and the soot dendrites are assumed to act as fil-
ters in parallel, they are exposed to different portions of in-flow. Wang
et al. [93] assumed that the fraction of flow across the dendrite is
proportional to the volume it occupies in the filter wall. The pressure
drop across a slab of the clogged filter is

.

(56)

A soot cake is formed on the interface between the inlet channel
and the filter wall when particles deposited in the filter wall prevents
further in-wall deposition. The soot cake can filter incoming particles
effectively once it is established.

The simplest model to describe the transition from deep bed filtra-
tion to soot cake formation would be the model used by Zhang et al.
[141]. A parameter called ‘‘depth filtration threshold’’ is defined as the
maximum amount (mass) of soot allowed to deposit within the filter
wall. All filtered particles are assumed to be trapped within the wall
before the soot load reaches the depth filtration threshold. Once the
filter wall is saturated, all subsequently filtered particles deposit on
the soot cake. As a result, the deep bed filtration and the soot cake
formation regime are distinct and non-overlapping.

Most unit collector models describe the transition by defining a
dimensionless parameter called partition coefficient Φ that lies between
0 (pure deep bed filtration) and 1 (pure soot cake formation). Two
versions of the formula have been seen in the literature

Φ =

where dc,interface is the collector diameter of the first filter wall slab i.e.
the one that is closest to the inlet channel. The maximum collector
diameter dc,max is calculated by matching the porosity of the collector
bed to the porosity of the clean filter wall [127]

and ψ is a model parameter called the percolation constant. It controls
the collector diameter at the onset of pure soot cake formation and
its value is usually calibrated to match experimental pressure drop
data [38].

Fig. 9. The effect of the percolation constant on filter calibration. The crosses in the
figure indicates the beginning of the soot cake formation regime..

The effect of the percolation constant is demonstrated in Fig. 9.
Increasing the value of the percolation constant allow more soot to
deposit within the filter wall during the deep bed filtration regime. As
a result, the transition to the soot cake formation regime occurs later
and at a higher filter pressure drop.

Filter models that divide the filter wall into multiple slabs often
adopt Eq. (57) [96,110,114,136]. This formulation implies that soot
cake formation is caused by the blockage of surface pores [63]. On
the other hand, filter models that adopted the two-layer approach use
Eq. (58) to describe the transition from deep bed filtration to soot cake
formation [99,103]. The physical interpretation is that soot cake forma-
tion is caused by full saturation of the filter wall. Both Eq. (57) and (58)
have been shown to match well with experimental data. Nonetheless,
the value of the calibrated percolation constant will be dependent on
the form of the partition coefficient equation and researchers should
be careful when they compare the values of percolation constants from
different studies.

Both the partition coefficient approaches and the depth filtration
threshold method requires the calibration of a model parameter for
each set of experimental data. The depth filtration threshold is only
useful at estimating the total soot load within the filter wall but it can-
not predict the filter performance under a different operating condition
other than the calibrated experimental dataset. Whilst the assumption
behind Eq. (57) resembles the experimental observations more closely,
its predictive power is limited as the value of the percolation constant
can vary greatly between different sets of experiments [63]. Further-
more, its value may also depend on the level of discretisation within
the filter wall as discussed in Section 2.2. In order to increase the
predictive power and applicability of the partition coefficient approach,
the dependence of the percolation constant on filter properties, lo-
cal flow conditions, the properties of incoming particulates and the
spatial discretisation should be studied. For example, Uenishi et al.
[143] found that the value of the percolation constant is related to
the filtration efficiency of the first wall layer and has described their
relationship with a third-order polynomial. Future studies should aim
to develop a correlation for percolation constant that allows accurate
predictions across a wide range of particulate filters.

In addition to the build-up of the soot cake due to pore blockage, the
soot cake itself is an effective filter medium. The partition coefficient
is often interpreted as the filtration efficiency of the cake layer [96,
144]. Serrano et al. [99] proposed that the soot cake filtration efficiency
is proportional to that of the porous wall, and modelled the soot cake
filtration efficiency as

[

Ecake = Ew max

0,

( Φ − Csat
1 − Csat

)]

,

(60)

where Csat is a model parameter called the limit saturation coefficient.
The cake filtration efficiency is zero when Φ ≤ Csat . After the partition
coefficient has exceeded the limit saturation coefficient, the filtration
efficiency of the soot cake increases and approaches that of the wall
when Φ = 1.

The approaches mentioned above have considered the filtration
efficiency of the soot cake as a function of the state of the filter wall
only. They have neglected the effect of the cake layer itself on the
filtration process. These approaches will not be able to describe the
filtration process correctly when an appreciable soot cake is present but
with a clean filter wall, which can occur during filter regeneration or
after a partial regeneration event [92]. Karamitros and Koltsakis [80]
considered the contribution towards soot cake growth from the filter
wall and the cake itself separately

Ecake = Emech1 + Emech2 − Emech1Emech2,

(61)

where Emech1 is the cake filtration efficiency due to pore blockage
and Emech2 is the filtration efficiency due to the presence of the cake.
Emech1 is assumed to be a linear function of the filter wall porosity and
Emech2 is assumed to be a linear function of the soot cake thickness
respectively. The introduction of Emech2 allows the filtration capability
of a developing soot cake to be modelled.

Premchand et al. [145] considered the initial soot cake formation by
interpreting the partition coefficient as the filtration efficiency of the
soot cake at the early stage of its formation. This continues until the
permeability of the filter wall reached a pre-defined value, at which
point Eq. (10) was applied to describe the filtration efficiency of the
soot cake. An additional multiplier was introduced by Premchand et al.
[145] to Eq. (10) to limit the maximum filtration efficiency of the soot
cake which is chosen to be 0.937. The collector diameter in the soot
cake is calculated using Eq. (9) with a user-specified pore diameter
defined as 100 nm in that work.

For fibrous filters, Wang et al. [93] modelled the cake filtration
efficiency using Eq. (11) with cake-specific parameters. The onset of
soot cake formation is determined by the soot volume fraction of the
top wall slab. This is analogous to Eq. (58). Once the soot volume
fraction reaches a pre-defined limit, the soot cake is formed assuming
dendrites begin to grow outside of the filter.

Most filter models assume that the soot cake is locally uniform,
which means the particle tree formation and connection regimes are
ignored. Serrano et al. [99]’s model captured the impact of particle tree
growth on the rate of increase of the cake thickness. The surface area on
the wall-channel interface that allows soot cake to grow on Acakegrowth
is

acg = 4dchLθ,

where θ is the area correction factor

θ = εw0 + (1 − εw0) min

[ wcake

]
, 1

(62)

(63)

assuming a linear change in available area for soot cake to grow.
Initially, particle trees only grow on the pores of the porous wall, at
this point θ = εw0. Since there is less area for the soot cake to grow on,
the rate of increase of the cake thickness is higher than when uniform
cake growth is assumed. The available area for cake growth increases
as the soot cake is formed during the particle tree connection stage and
eventually, uniform cake growth is observed (θ = 1). The cake thickness
when uniform cake growth begins wcake,lim is a model input that may
be measured experimentally [76].

The overall pressure drop of the filter is increased by the formation
of the soot cake via two means. First, it reduces the available cross-
sectional area in the inlet channels for gas flow in the axial direction.
Second, an additional pressure drop is caused by gas having to flow
through the soot cake.

The momentum balance in the axial direction of the inlet channel

in channel-scale models is [146]

thickness of the soot cake can be calculated from the mass of the soot
cake, assuming that the shape of the soot cake is geometrically similar
to the channel cross-section [147]. For filters with square channels as

can be affected by the temperature and the pressure of the system.

In situ direct measurements showed that the porosity of the soot
cake in DPFs lies between 0.93 to 0.97 [149]. The porosity of the soot
cake is expected to be no less than 0.83 [128]. The packing of the soot
cake depends on the local gas flow condition. If the gas flow velocity
is high, ballistic deposition of soot particles is expected and the soot
cake will be dense; otherwise sparse diffusion-limited structures will
form [150]. Konstandopoulos et al. [151] suggested that the soot cake
porosity is a function of the local Peclet number

cakes may exhibit Bingham-like behaviour i.e. the packing of the soot
cake is unaffected until the pressure difference across it exceeds a
critical value. They suggested using the following equation should be
used to describe the pressure dependence of the soot cake packing

where ΔPcake,lim is the minimum pressure drop required to affect the

The pressure drop across the soot cake is usually described by
Darcy’s law (Eq. (41)), which requires the knowledge of the thickness
and the permeability of the soot cake [153–156]. Assuming constant

where C is a numerical parameter, P0 is the pressure at reference
condition (at which κcake0 is defined) and M r is the average molecular
weight of the gas. Mahadevan et al. [136] considered the change in
soot cake permeability due to the change in mean free path length of
the gas

[ρcakeκcake] = C

λ
λref

,

(72)

where λ is the mean free path length and λref is the mean free path
length at a specific condition. The calibration constant C is fitted
against experimental data.

Some works have attempted to relate the permeability of the soot
cake with its microstructure. Konstandopoulos et al. [148] used Eq. (52)
to estimate the soot cake permeability assuming the soot cake is a bed
of spherical primary particles. The Cunningham correction factor is
calculated using the primary particle diameter as the relevant length
scale (O(10 nm)). On the other hand, Serrano et al. [138] argued that
the slip phenomenon is governed by the pore diameter of the soot
cake. In their work, the mean aggregate diameter (O(100 nm)) was used
in Eq. (52) instead of the primary particle diameter. As a result, the
calibrated soot cake porosity ranged from 0.6 to 0.7. The discrepancy
between the low soot cake porosity calibrated by Serrano et al. [138]
and the experimental data measured by Liu et al. [149] (0.93–0.97)
may be explained by Fig. 11.

Models used by Serrano et al. [138], Payri et al. [103] and Macián
et al. [122] treated the soot cake as a spherical packed bed formed
by soot aggregates. However, the soot aggregates are ‘‘porous’’ because
they have fractal-like structures. The actual porosity of the soot cake de-
pends on both the macro-porosity between soot aggregates εcake,macro
and the micro-porosity within the soot aggregates εcake,micro

εcake = 1 −

1 − εcake,macro

) (

) ,

(73)

the true porosity of the cake becomes 0.93 if εcake,macro = 0.65 and
εcake,micro = 0.81 (typical porosity of mean soot aggregate [138]) are
assumed, which is consistent with experimental observations.

The equations above have assumed that all particles within the
soot cake have the same size. In the case where there is a significant
size variation, Endo et al. [161] proposed an equation to estimate the
pressure drop across the soot cake if the soot particles within the cake
have a log-normal particle size distribution

Given the high porosity in the soot cake, Thomas et al. [162] sug-
gested that it should be modelled as a fibrous structure with ‘‘particle
chains’’ as the fibres. The pressure drop across the soot cake can then
be described as

Ribeyre et al. [163] used Eqs. (74) and (75) to study the effect of
humidity on the pressure drop across the soot cake. It was found that
whilst the thickness of the soot cake decreased slightly with increasing
water content, the overall pressure drop increased with water content
due to reduced permeability as void space within the soot cake was
reduced. On the other hand, Konstandopoulos et al. [128] suggested
that crack formation can occur if the wetted soot cake is left to dry. The
pressure drop across the soot cake will therefore be reduced as cracks
provided a shortcut for gas flow and hence the overall permeability is
increased.

2.4. Impact on catalytic conversion of gaseous pollutants

Particulate filters often have a catalytic coating to convert gaseous
pollutants and aid regeneration. Here we discuss the impact of par-
ticle deposition on the performance of catalytic filters during non-
regenerating conditions. The efficiency of catalytic conversion depends
on the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and the transport of reactants
towards the catalyst. Soot deposits within catalytic filters introduce
additional mass transfer resistances via various means.

First, the soot cake can affect the convective mass transfer in the

inlet channels. The species balance in the inlet channel is [164]

(76)

where cg is the molar concentration of the gas species, d is the channel
diameter, wcake is the soot cake thickness, vw is the through-wall gas
velocity and km is the convective mass transfer coefficient. In addition
to modifying the effective channel diameter, the presence of the soot
cake can also affect the convective mass transfer coefficient. The mass
transfer coefficient may be calculated using the correlations such as the
one developed by Bissett et al. [70]

Sh =

km(d − 2wcake)
Dm,g

= 2.98 + 0.6Pew − 0.143Rew,

where Dm,g is the bulk diffusivity of gaseous species, Pew is the Peclet
number and Rew is the Reynolds number for the through-wall gas flow,
which means they are functions of vw. The presence of the soot cake
can affect the mass transfer coefficient implicitly due to its effect on
the through-wall gas flow velocity profile via Eq. (64).

Furthermore, the soot cake acts as a diffusive barrier between the
in-wall catalyst and the bulk gas in the inlet channel. An advection–
diffusion–reaction equation is needed to resolve the concentration gra-
dient across the soot cake [49]

∂cg
∂t

= −vw

∂cg
∂y

+ Dm,cake

∂2cg
∂y2

+ ̇ω,

(78)

where y is the through-wall coordinate, Dm,cake is the effective diffu-
sivity of the soot cake and ̇ω is the rate of species production due to
chemical reactions. It can be seen from Eqs. (76) and (78) that the
presence of the soot cake will have no impact on the concentration
̇ω = 0. This is usually the case in the soot cake when no
profile if
regeneration occurs within the filters [165]. A notable exception is ob-
served in catalysed DPFs when there are notable chemical interactions
between the soot cake and SCR-related species under certain operating
conditions. Adsorption of NH3 as well as fast SCR and NO2-SCR activity
was found to occur on the surface of soot deposits [166,167]. If these
reactions are appreciable, Eq. (78) may need to be solved in the soot
cake. Furthermore, soot may react with ammonium nitrate and produce
CO/CO2, which suppressed the formation of N2O [168]. Under these
conditions, the interaction between ammonium nitrate and soot cannot
be captured by direct integration of independently developed soot and
SCR kinetics [169]. It was suggested by Mihai et al. [168] that the
presence of soot can inhibit the formation of ammonium nitrate which
is formed at low temperature with high NO2 at the inlet. This subse-
quently leads to an increase in SCR performance since less ammonium
nitrate is inhibiting SCR activity.

Significant diffusion can occur within the catalysed filter wall [164].
Eq. (78) can be applied to the wall if Dm,cake is replaced by the
diffusivity of the filter wall Dm,w. The diffusivity of the filter wall can
be estimated using the parallel pore model which considers both bulk
diffusion and Knudsen diffusion [137,164]

diffusivity of the gas and Dm,Kn is the Knudsen diffusivity

.

(80)

In principle, the porosity and the pore diameter of the filter wall
under certain soot loading may be calculated by the unit collector
model using Eqs. (9), (39) and (40). However, since tortuosity is usually
calibrated to match experimental data [80,114], the impact of soot
deposit on in-wall diffusion via porosity reduction may be masked by
the uncertainty of the tortuosity calibration. Furthermore, no model
has been established to describe the variation in tortuosity as the wall
soot load increases. This limits the accuracy of the effective diffusivity
estimation.

In addition to the diffusion across the filter wall, Greiner et al. [170]
found that pore diffusion within the catalyst particle is important and it
can be more significant than the effect of advection–diffusion across the
wall as described in Eq. (78). The authors suggested that the application
of an effectiveness factor to catalytic reactions within the wall is a good
choice to consider pore diffusion in channel-scale filter models. The
effectiveness factor γ is the ‘‘ratio of the effective to the maximum reaction
rate’’ [171]

(77)

̇ω = γ ̇ωmax,

(81)

where ̇ω and ̇ωmax are the actual and maximum rate of production of
a chemical products. The maximum rate of production is calculated
assuming the system is kinetic-limited i.e. there is no mass transfer limi-
tation. It should be noted that the effectiveness factor approach assumes
that the chemical reaction is first-order with a single reactant. Chundru
et al. [114] modelled the impact of soot deposits on the mass transfer at
the catalyst surface by adopting the unit collector concept. The model
is illustrated in Fig. 12.

The thickness of the soot deposits on the surface of collectors can

be shown as

(84)

Whilst increased mass transfer resistance due to soot deposition is
generally considered to be negative, the overall performance of the
catalyst may benefit from deteriorated species transport. For example,
the presence of soot can inhibit NH3 oxidation in SCR-coated filters
at high temperatures. This allows more NH3 to be available for NOx
reduction reactions [168].

2.5. Impact on heat transfer

The heat transfer phenomena and temperature distributions within
particulate filters are important topics within the field of filter mod-
elling studies. Many publications have studied the thermal behaviour
of particulate filters especially during active regeneration [172–178].
However, the impact of deposits on the heat transfer process has not
been studied in detail.

It is common to assume that the gas within the porous wall is at local
thermal equilibrium with the filter substrate [119,179]. The tempera-
ture variation across the soot cake and the wall is also usually neglected
in filter models. This assumption has been investigated by Haralampous
and Koltsakis [180] and they found the following condition for this
assumption to hold
cpg ̇minwcake

(85)

where cpg is the specific heat capacity of the gas,
̇min is the inlet mass
flow rate to the filter, a is the total area of the interface between the
inlet channel and the porous wall and Λcake is the thermal conductivity
of soot deposits. When this condition is satisfied, only a single equation
is needed to be solved for the temperature of the solid phase of the filter
in single-channel models [181]

between the filter wall and the inlet/outlet channel, Λw is the thermal

The heat released from regeneration can be calculated from the
change in enthalpies of gaseous reactants and products [181,182]. The
convective heat transfer coefficient in the inlet channel depends on the
gas flow across the wall, characterised by the wall Reynolds number
and the Prantdl number [57,70,183]. The presence of soot in and on
the wall can affect h1 implicitly, similar to its impact on convective
mass transfer (Section 2.4).

The density and the thickness of the soot cake have been inves-
tigated by many researchers and have been discussed in Section 2.3.
On the other hand, the specific heat capacity cp,cake and the thermal
conductivity Λcake of soot deposits have not been subjected to the same
level of scrutiny. The impact of soot loading on the filter wall thermal
conductivity Λw is usually neglected. Many models have included cp,cake
and Λp,cake in their model equations without explicitly stating the values
used for these parameters [91,114,120,154,158,159,179]. The values
of specific heat capacities of soot deposits and the thermal conductivity
of soot cakes are summarised in Table 1.

Literature values for the specific heat capacity of the soot cake
agree reasonably and are comparable to that of the filter wall substrate
material (1120 J/kgK for cordierite, 800 J/kgK for SiC [181]). On the
other hand, values of thermal conductivities span over two orders of
magnitude. If the thermal conductivities of the soot cake and the filter
wall are vastly different, the assumption that the soot cake and the filter
wall are at local thermal equilibrium breaks down as heat will dissipate
at different speeds in the soot cake and the filter wall.

Since the soot cake is porous, its thermal conductivity would be a

function of its porosity [180]

Λcake = εΛg + (1 − ε) Λsoot .

(87)

Assuming for a moment that pure soot has the same thermal prop-
erties as black carbon (1.6 W/mK), the thermal conductivity of a soot
cake with 97% porosity would be 0.108 W/mK [180]. This suggested
that the values of thermal conductivities assumed by Depcik and As-
sanis [184] and Di Sarli and Di Benedetto [185] are unlikely to be
realistic, as those values are closer to typical thermal conductivities of
metal oxides.

So far there has been little attention to how soot deposits can
impact heat transfer as it is less influential than other factors such as
the operating condition and substrate properties. This is reflected in
literature modelling studies where very different values have been used
for the thermal properties of soot deposits and yet all manage to get
good agreement with experimental data. This is reasonable since the
mass of soot deposits in particulate filters is small with respect to the
filter substrate, and it is not an excellent heat insulator nor a huge heat
sink.

3.1. Reaction pathways

The major oxidants of soot deposits in particulate filters are O2 and
NO2 [186]. Soot oxidation by NO is usually neglected as NO is a weaker
oxidant than O2 under the expected operating conditions of particulate
filters [187]. Regeneration of soot by O2 and NO2 can be expressed
as [37]

(88)

(89)

where Υ1 and Υ2 are stoichiometric coefficients of the regeneration
reactions. Soot is usually represented as pure carbon (C) in regeneration
reactions [188]. The formation of N2 from NO2-assisted soot oxidation
has also been considered in the literature [189]. When both NO2
and O2 are available in the exhaust, a synergistic effect has been
observed [190]. The overall rate of soot oxidation is higher than the
sum of O2-only oxidation and NO2-only oxidation activities, which
suggests the existence of NO2-assisted O2 oxidations [186]

C + NO2 +

Pyrolysis may happen in the absence of oxygen. This commonly
occurs in gasoline engines [47]. Mitsouridis et al. [160] considered the
formation of CO from soot and CO2

(91)

C + CO2 → 2CO.

(92)

This reaction is limited by thermodynamics at low temperatures
and is therefore not expected to occur in DPFs. Nonetheless, it may be
appreciable in GPFs since the exhaust temperature is generally higher
in GPFs than in DPFs [191].

The performance of regeneration can be improved by coating the
particulate filter with oxidation catalysts. First, oxidation catalysts can
produce NO2 from NO to support regeneration [49]. Second, catalysts
can greatly improve CO2 selectivity over CO [192,193] by oxidising CO
during regeneration [194]. Third, the presence of catalysts can lower
the light-off temperature of regeneration reactions [195,196]. This can
reduce the peak temperature during active regeneration [185], which
in turn reduces the chance of filter failure due to thermal-induced
stress.

The soot–catalyst contact can influence the regeneration perfor-
mance of the catalyst [51]. It is strongly dependent on the morphology
of the catalyst and support [197,198]. The morphology is particularly
important for soot oxidation since trapped particles are immobile [199,
200]. As most of the soot cake is not touching the filter wall, only ther-
mal (uncatalysed) regeneration is appreciable in the soot cake [119].
Nonetheless, the catalyst can improve regeneration of the soot cake by
producing oxidants such as NO2 that can diffuse towards the soot cake.
The dependence of catalysed regeneration on soot–catalyst contact con-
ditions can also vary with temperature. Piumetti et al. [201] found that
the impact of the soot–catalyst condition on catalysed soot oxidation
is more significant at high temperatures for self-prepared ceria-based
catalysts. The catalysed soot oxidation can be insensitive to the surface
contact condition at low temperature if the surface of the catalyst is
masked by adsorbed species.

Other species in the exhaust can also affect regeneration reactions.
The presence of H2O and CO2 has been observed to slightly delay
soot ignition [192]. On the other hand, H2O has also been reported to
catalyse NO2 regeneration [195]. In addition, O2-only soot oxidation
may be catalysed by water vapour between 450 ◦C and 600 ◦C [202].
It should be noted that soot does not only contain elemental carbon.
Whilst catalyst may be active for the oxidation of elemental carbon
in soot particles, it may not be active for the oxidation of adsorbed
polyaromatics [203]. If this is the case, polyaromatics may be released
into the atmosphere during regeneration.

The rates of regeneration reactions depend on the filter temperature,
the concentration of gaseous reactants, the properties of the particles,
and the catalysts involved. A general equation to describe the rate of
regeneration reaction is

r = −

dmp
dt

= kGΓ ,

(93)

where k is the reaction rate constant, G is a function of the concen-
trations of the gaseous reactants and Γ is a function of particle state,
usually its mass. It should be noted that the rate of regeneration is
often presented as the rate of oxidant consumption instead of the rate
of soot mass consumption. These rates may be interconverted based on
the stoichiometry of regeneration reactions.

Arrhenius-type equations are frequently used to describe reaction

rate constants [157,204,205]

k = AT b exp

(

−

E

)

,

(94)

where A is the pre-exponential constant, b is the temperature exponent
and E is the activation energy of the reaction. The temperature expo-
nent b is often assumed to be 0 [206–208] or 1 [153,158,209,210]
before any calibration. Catalysed and thermal regeneration are often
modelled as independent reactions with different rate parameters [107,
153,185].

G in Eq. (93) is usually a function of concentrations of gaseous
oxidants [115,207,209–211]. Since O2 and NO2 are the most common
oxidants for filter regeneration, the following expressions can cover
most variations of G used in the literature

G = c

qO2
O2

,

(95)

where c is molar concentration and q is the reaction order of the oxi-
dants. G can also be defined in terms of partial pressures, mass fractions
or mole fractions of oxidants [91,107,110]. Regeneration reactions are
often assumed to be first-order in the involved oxidants [157,158,204,
211,212]. However, experimental studies have shown that the reaction
order of O2 regeneration ranges between 0.8 to 1 in the absence of
catalysts [213–215]. This implies that the rate of oxidation is deter-
mined by the adsorption of oxygen on active carbon sites [216]. The
presence of a catalytic coating in the filter can affect the reaction orders
with respect to oxidants since the rate-determining step is different. For
example, the reaction order of O2 in a regeneration reaction catalysed
by a Pt/Pd catalyst is found to be 0.3 [107]. It should be noted that the
influences of catalyst on different regeneration pathways are different
e.g. the reaction order of NO2 regeneration remains 0.6 regardless of
the presence of the Pt/Pd catalyst [107].

Chemical species other than the oxidants can affect the reaction
rates as well. Schejbal et al. [189] used the following expression for
NO2-only regeneration to include the catalytic effect of water vapour

is the nth-order model [153,207,209,211,215,217]

Γ = m

If the oxidation occurs solely on the surface of the particle, the rate
of the regeneration should be proportional to the surface area of the
particles and hence the reaction order qp = 2
. On the other hand,

qp = 1 implies internal burning and hence the rate of regeneration is
proportional to the mass of the particles [206]. Kinetic studies some-
times include the initial mass of soot into the rate equation [213,214]

It will be difficult to integrate such rate equations with simula-
tions of continuously regenerating filters since the history of trapped
particles needs to be tracked to compute the rate of regeneration.

Some authors expressed the formation of CO and CO2 as separate re-
actions with their own rate parameters. Alternatively, the temperature-
dependence of the CO selectivity ΨCO may be modelled as such [157]

where ̇c is the rate of production of chemical species in molar concen-
tration. The Arrhenius parameters of the CO selectivity A′, E′ and q′
will need to be calibrated.

Once the expression of reaction rate is chosen, kinetic parameters
are typically calibrated based on experimental data. Engine bench
tests should be used to determine soot oxidation kinetics to ensure
that experimental results are obtained with real soot under realistic
operating conditions [218], although thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
is also used frequently. The importance of the methodology on the rate
parameters was highlighted by Bogarra et al. [215] who found that
TGA with a heat ramp and isothermal TGA gave different estimates of
rate parameters. It should also be noted that Printex-U is often used
as a surrogate of diesel soot with high elemental carbon content in
kinetics tests [47]. Whilst Printex-U oxidises similarly to ash-free GDI
soot [219], its oxidation behaviour does not always represent real diesel
soot [220].

The reactive surface area of soot particles plays a role in controlling
the rate of oxidation. Many models assume a fixed specific surface area
for the soot cake during regeneration [91,114,120,136,154,158,181,
204]. This is counter-intuitive as we expect particles to become smaller
as it burns and hence an increase in the specific surface area [44].
This is expected to speed up combustion because of the increasing
surface–volume ratio [217].

The change in surface area of soot particles is dependent on the
combustion mode of the particles. Different burning modes were ob-
served when soot particles were oxidised by different oxidants. When
only O2 is present, significant internal burning can occur within soot
particles [221]. This is due to the preferential removal of amorphous
carbon over less reactive graphitic carbon. On the other hand, NO2 has
shown no preference. As a result, a shrinking sphere model is adequate
to describe the change in specific surface area during soot oxidation
by NO2. When both NO2 and O2 are present, the degree of internal
burning is greatly suppressed due to cooperative oxidation (Eq. (90)
and (91)). Whether internal burning occurs also depends on the soot
composition. Jung et al. [222] found that acetylene soot is impermeable
to O2 and hence combustion will only occur on the soot surface.

Macián et al. [122] considered the mass transport phenomena
within soot aggregates during regeneration. Diffusion of oxidants
within the soot aggregate as well as the adsorption of oxidants onto the
reactive sites are considered. The impact of the adsorption and reaction
of gaseous reactants on the rate of regeneration is described by the
Langmuir isotherm

where Eads is the activation energy of the adsorption step. Using this
model, Macián et al. [122] found that the equivalent reaction order of
NO2 is around 0.3 and 0.4 in typical passive regeneration conditions,
whereas the equivalent reaction order of O2 varied during the course
of regeneration.

The evolution of specific surface area during regeneration may be

modelled as [213]
√

Sp = Sp0 (1 − ζ)

1 − Π ln (1 − ζ),

(106)

where Sp0 is the initial specific surface area and ζ is the conversion of
soot. The structural factor Π describes the initial pore structure within
soot aggregates [226]. According to this equation, the surface area will
increase initially due to pore growth. As regeneration continues, the
surface area will reach a maximum and then decrease as the remaining
soot collapses into itself.

Some works have found that there is no correlation between the
specific surface area and soot reactivity [219,227]. Zygogianni et al.
[228] found that structural differences of soot (e.g. the size of crystal-
lite) and the composition of particles are more correlated to the soot
oxidation reactivity. For example, a higher degree of graphitisation
(more ordered structure) leads to less reactive soot [229]. However,
most models neglect the difference in nanostructure of soot particles
and treated them as pure carbon species [120,179,182]. Kastrinaki
et al. [209] proposed a multi-population kinetics to describe soot oxida-
tion behaviour. The soot samples were divided into three populations
with their own reaction rate constants and activation energies. The
authors attributed the difference in soot oxidation behaviour to distinct
families of surface oxygen complexes (SOC) formed on the carbon
surface of each population; Kastrinaki et al. [209] hypothesised that
the differences in activation energies of the three soot populations
are caused by the different bond configurations on the carbon surface
i.e. single, double or triple bonds.

Furthermore, real engine soot also contains a soluble organic frac-
tion (SOF) and ash. Soot oxidation activity may be enhanced by higher
soluble organic fraction (SOF) content and weakly bonded carbon
(WBC) content [230]. Removal of SOF can lead to a rapid increase
in the specific surface area of soot particles at the early stage of
oxidation [231]. Depending on the ash composition, soot oxidation
activity may be enhanced or reduced [208]. Ash particles may act as
oxygen carrier which improves soot oxidation [76]. On the other hand,
ash originated from phosphate-doped fuel was found to inhibit soot
oxidation [232].

Ash may be deliberately introduced by doping the fuel with fuel-
borne catalyst (FBC) metal additives because this can reduce the tem-
perature at which soot burns off in the filter [233]. FBC is expected
to perform better than the catalytic coating on filter walls because of
close contact between ash and soot especially in the soot cake [232].
Ash accumulates in the filter while soot burns off.

Easter [219] observed a three-stage oxidation behaviour for ash-rich
GDI soot. This was attributed to the change in soot–ash contact during
oxidation. The proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. 13.

Initially, soot and ash are in close contact and the rate of oxidation
is at its highest. As regeneration continues, the contact between soot
and ash is lost, result in a lower oxidation rate. The rate of oxidation is
recovered slightly towards the end of the oxidation, as contact between
remaining soot and ash are re-established since the majority of soot is
already consumed.

Although the contact condition between soot, ash and catalyst can
affect the regeneration performance significantly [51], quantification of
the impact of soot-ash-catalyst contact on regeneration is rarely seen in
literature filter models. Konstandopoulos et al. [211] studied the effect
of the size of milled catalyst particles on their soot oxidation ability
using the multi-population model [209]. They found that reducing the
size of ceria catalyst particles can increase the oxidation rate of highly
and moderately reactive soot (Activation energies of 120 kJ/mol and
180 kJ/mol respectively), whereas the oxidation of the least reactive
soot (240 kJ/mol) was insensitive to the size of catalyst particles. Note
that Konstandopoulos et al. [211] have kept the activation energies of
soot populations constant regardless of the presence of a catalyst. Other
authors often use lower activation energy for catalysed regeneration
pathways with respect to thermal regeneration pathways [119].

Catalysts within the filter can assist NO2 regeneration by producing
NO2 from NO, although no catalytic effect was observed with platinum
catalyst on the rate of NO2 soot oxidation [189,234]. If NO2 is being
produced within catalysed filter walls, it can aid oxidation of the soot
cake. NO2 may reach the soot cake via back-diffusion [137]. In order
to capture the concentration gradient across the soot cake and the
filter wall, Eq. (78) would need to be solved in channel-scale models.
The soot cake would need to be discretised in this case to resolve
the concentration gradient of NO2 across the soot cake [204]. On the
other hand, competition for NO2 can occur between passive regen-
eration and SCR reactions in SCR-coated filters [132]. SCR reactions
are more competitive for NO2 than soot oxidation [235], although at
high temperatures, soot oxidation can outweigh SCR reactions [236].
Furthermore, NH3 may block free-edge sites on carbon particles. This
phenomenon has been modelled by Trandafilović et al. [226].

It is shown in this section that the rates of regeneration reactions
are influenced by many factors, ranging from the nanostructure of soot
deposits, the surface of soot deposits, their ‘‘non-soot’’ components and
the presence of catalysts. Many researchers have developed models to
quantify the impact of these factors, but it remains a challenging task to
combine these developments into a coherent regeneration model that
can capture the effect of all factors mentioned above.

3.3. Evolution of particle deposit

The changes of soot cake properties during regeneration are often
ignored in modelling studies [91]. Many filter modelling studies have
assumed that the packing density of the soot cake remains constant
during regeneration [114,120,179,181,204,237]. The thickness of the
soot cake wcake under O2 regeneration may be obtained by solving the
following equation [91]

dwcake

,

(112)

where v is the through-wall gas flow velocity, ρg is the gas density,
YO2,0
is the mass fraction of oxygen at the top of the soot cake, Υ is the
stoichiometric coefficient of O2, Sp is the specific surface area of the
soot cake and k is the reaction rate constant described by an Arrhenius-
type equation (Eq. (94)). Bissett [238] has shown the steps to derive
Eq. (112).

Kostoglou and Konstandopoulos [239] examined how assumptions
about the microstructure of the soot cake can affect the calibration and
prediction of the regeneration process. Four models were considered in
their work and are shown in Fig. 14.

The packing density and the specific surface area of the soot cake
are the two relevant parameters during the regeneration process [239].
The first model in Fig. 14 assumes constant cake density and specific
surface throughout regeneration. The second model treats the soot
cake as spherical particles held in stationary cells that all burn at the
same rate. The third model treats the soot cake as cylindrical columns
with the same diameters as the primary soot particles. The fourth
model treats the soot cake as columns of spherical particles, where
the movement of particles and hence a change in cake thickness is

considered, in contrast to the second model. The fourth model was
used to fit against experimental data and good agreement was found.
The authors suggested that future soot cake models should track the
evolution of both the cake density and the cake thickness.

However, the change in the microstructure of the soot cake during
regeneration has been experimentally observed to be more complicated
than cases considered by Kostoglou and Konstandopoulos [239]. Fig. 15
shows a conceptual model proposed by Toops et al. [240] who studied
the evolution of the soot cake during active regeneration using neutron
tomography.

During the first stage of regeneration, the soot cake becomes thinner
and more compact while maintaining its structural uniformity. At the
second stage, the soot cake becomes more porous without significant
change in the cake thickness. Many irregular scallops were observed
through SEM during this stage [76]. A similar phenomenon was also
observed for GDI soot [219]. The formation of these scallops may
be driven by the high attractive force between soot deposits, which
is stronger than the attractive forces between soot and filter wall
substrate [241]. The packing density and the thickness of the soot cake
continue to decrease gradually after the second stage until the soot cake
is completely oxidised.

The rate of pressure drop reduction was observed to be higher
during the second stage of active regeneration than the first and the
third stage [76,242]. This implies an increase in the permeability of the
soot cake. Mahadevan et al. [136] modelled the increase in soot cake
permeability using an analogy with cracked concrete [243]. The cracks
in concrete allow gas to flow through with little resistance which results
in an increase in the permeability. In the case of the soot cake, the
‘‘cracks’’ are the gaps between soot scallops formed during the second
stage of active regeneration. The permeability of the damaged soot cake
is modelled as

κcake = κcake,0 exp

[(C1ζd

]

)C2

,

(113)

where C1 and C2 are calibrated parameters. The damage variable ζd is
defined as

ζd = 1 −

mcake
mcake,0

.

(114)

In contrast to active regeneration, the combined permeability of
the clogged wall and the soot cake is not altered significantly by
passive regeneration [244]. The bottom of the soot cake has the highest
regeneration rate during passive regeneration of catalysed filters since
NO2 is generated in the catalysed wall and then diffuses back to the
soot cake. The soot cake has been discretised into multiple layers in
filter models in order to resolve the concentration gradient within the

et al. [205]. A mobility term is introduced to describe the movement of soot due to
regeneration.

soot cake. The model proposed by Wurzenberger et al. [205] used a
fixed spatial grid to describe the soot cake as shown in Fig. 16.

A mobility term for soot mass is needed to describe the shrinking
of the cake layer during regeneration. The rate of migration of soot is
expressed as

̇mmob,i = Cmobαsoot,iεi+1,

(115)

were Cmob is a mobility factor, αsoot,i is the volume fraction of soot of the
ith layer and εi+1 is the void fraction of the (i + 1)th layer that is below
the ith layer. On the other hand, Haralampous and Koltsakis [245]
discretised the soot cake into a fixed number of slabs. The soot cake
is re-divided into elements of equal mass at every time step. Whilst a
moving grid approach can reduce numerical diffusion [246], this model
does not consider the local variation of soot cake properties such as the
porosity, unlike the model used by Wurzenberger et al. [205].

Sometimes the soot cake may collapse during regeneration and
leads to the formation of a mid-channel soot plug. This will lead to
a rapid increase in pressure drop. Since the pressure drop of the filter
is frequently used to estimate the soot load of the filter by on-board
controls [152], the formation of mid-channel soot plug will lead to
malfunction of the on-board control. Fukui et al. [247] found that this
phenomenon can be invoked with intermittent increases of flow rate
and engine torque. A later study by Kim et al. [248] showed that three
factors would be needed to trigger the collapse of the soot cake. First,
passive regeneration by in-situ NO2 generation is needed to create a
gap between the soot cake and the filter wall. Second, water needs
to adsorb onto the soot cake and create a concave shape in the soot.
Finally, the collapse of the soot cake is triggered by a cold start with
heavy acceleration. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon
has yet to be included in the after treatment models reported in the
literature.

Various experimental studies have reported surges in the concen-
tration of particle being released from regenerating filters [249]. Large
(80 nm) solid particles have been observed to be released from par-
ticulate filters during active regeneration [229]. They are likely to
be unfiltered particles that pass straight through the filter due to a
reduction in the filtration efficiency after regeneration [250]. Many
sub−23 nm particles have also been observed [251]. They are com-
posed of semi-volatile material since they are not detected under high
dilution ratio conditions [22]. They may be sulphuric acid particles des-
orbed from the catalyst [250,252]. Passively regenerating filters were
found to have lower particle emission levels than actively regenerating
filters [253] since the presence of soot cake can limit the reduction in
filtration efficiency.

The increased emission of solid particles during regeneration have
been modelled in the literature. Lao et al. [92] has proposed an empir-
ical model to describe the reduction in filtration efficiency of the soot
cake due to non-uniform regeneration using a sigmoid function

based on the experimental filtration efficiency measurements during
active regeneration. A reduction in the wall filtration efficiency at
elevated temperatures was also discovered during the model calibration
process. This reduction in filtration efficiency cannot be explained by
the removal of trapped particles. The cause of the reduction in filtration
efficiency was not identified and remains an open question.

Tan et al. [107] simulated the emission of particles during the
passive regeneration of a catalysed filter. The leaked particles were
hypothesised to be fragments of soot particles produced during catalytic
oxidation in the filter wall. A correction factor was applied to the com-
bined single collector efficiency predicted by the model (η in Eq. (10)).
The correction factor Cfrag was made to be a function of the partition
coefficient Φ (Eq. (57))

where Φhigh and Φlow are the limiting partition coefficients chosen
by Tan et al. [107]. The minimum correction factor Cf rag,min describes
the level of fragmentation and is a function of particle size and op-
erating condition. Whilst the model is largely empirical, it allows
quantification of the factor Cf rag and can help further the development
of a more physical model.

Predicting the release of particles formed from semi-volatile mate-
rial during regeneration is difficult because they are difficult to mea-
sure [254]. The state of the semi-volatile particles is strongly dependent
on the gas phase composition. Significant losses of semi-volatile parti-
cles can occur within the measuring system due to diffusional losses of
particles to the walls of the measurement device. Lee et al. [21] pre-
sented a model that considers sulphates and SOF particles in addition to
solid soot particles. The model was shown to be successful in describing
the evolution of the particle population in both the engine and in the
particle sampling system. The release of semi-volatile particles during
filter regeneration may be captured if this type of modelling approach
is integrated with existing filter models.

4. Modelling ash accumulation and migration

4.1. Formation mechanisms

Ash are formed from incombustible residues that remains in partic-
ulate filters after regeneration. The ash can be distributed within the
filter wall, form a layer on the filter wall and can form plugs at the
end of inlet channels. In some cases, ash plugs can also be found in the
middle of inlet channels. These are illustrated in Fig. 17.

The pattern of ash deposition is closely related to the regeneration
process, the pattern is not dictated by whether the regeneration process
is active or passive [255]. A passively regenerated filter with high NOx
content and high temperature can have a similar ash deposition pattern
to actively regenerated filters.

Deep-bed ash deposits are formed by the regeneration of ash-
containing soot particles that are trapped within the walls of a fil-
ter [255]. Whilst most experimental studies have shown that ash
usually only deposits on the surface of filter walls [133,256], there
is experimental evidence of deep penetration of ash into filter walls
(≥ 50% of the wall thickness [257]). Kamp et al. [258] found that
ash deposits penetrated the filter walls of sintered metal fibre filters
further if the filter undergoes active regeneration instead of passive
regeneration. This is because the persistent presence of the soot cake
during passive regeneration acted as an effective barrier for ash-bearing
soot to deposit within the filter wall.

The ash layer and the ash plug are formed from the combustion of
the soot cake. The ash plug is formed from soot fragments produced
during regeneration which migrate towards the back of the inlet chan-
nels [133]. An optical study conducted by Matsuno and Kitamura [259]
found that lumps of soot can migrate towards the end of inlet channels
during active regeneration. Whether ash plugs form at the early stages
of ash accumulation depends on the initial amount of soot [259]. Once
the ash layer is established, it makes soot migration during active
regeneration occur more readily [259]. Shearing flow can also cause
ash to migrate towards the back of inlet channels. Whether ash particles
are re-entrained into the gas flow depends on their size [18]. Particles
with diameters around 100 μm are the easiest to be re-entrained [260].
Larger particles are difficult to be re-entrained due to their inertia and
smaller particles are difficult to be re-entrained due to their smaller
surfaces [261].

The size of ash particles depends on the regeneration conditions.
Low regeneration temperature, low soot loading and high soot-to-ash
ratio before regeneration can lead to the formation of small, densely
packed ash particles [261]. These ash particles may grow by sintering
with temperature excursion and become more sticky [262,263]. Bagi
et al. [264] optically observed the densification and sintering of ash
precursor remained from soot oxidation. As ash particles sinter and
increase in size, they may be more susceptible to shearing flow which
can lead to formation of the ash plugs in the mid-channel [265].

Modelling the formation of ash is a challenging task. The following
three aspects need to be considered in modelling ash deposition in
particulate filters:

1. Movement of ash fractions as part of soot particles due to

filtration and regeneration-induced migration.

2. Movement of ash deposits due to flow-induced migration.
3. Change in size and structure of ash deposits due to agglomera-

tion and sintering at high temperature.

The filtration process can be modelled as described in Section 2. Ad-
ditional variables such as ash mass fraction within soot particles need
to be tracked by the filter model in order to simulate the deposition of
ash contained within soot particles. The migration of soot cake during
regeneration can be described by the following equation [157]

∂wcake
∂t

+ Cmob

∂(vwcake)
∂z

where wcake is the (local) thickness of the soot cake, v is the axial
gas flow velocity and Cmob is the mobility constant. Deng et al. [157]
did not specify how the mobility constant may be calibrated. Recent
work by Koltsakis et al. [266] has considered the detachment and re-
deposition of the soot cake due to the shear stress experienced by the
soot cake. The shear stress ι can be calculated [267]

ι =

Ff μv
4(dc − 2wcake − 2wash)

(119)

where Ff is the laminar channel flow friction factor, μ is the dynamic
viscosity, v is the local axial gas flow velocity and (dc − 2wcake − 2wash)
is the channel diameter of the open cross-section available for gas flow
after accounting for the thicknesses of the soot cake and the ash layer.

value. The detached fragment will flow along the inlet channel until
it reattaches to the soot cake. This happens in the model if the local
shear stress drops below critical reattachment shear stress. No explicit
formula or values regarding the critical shear stresses were reported
by Koltsakis et al. [266]. The critical shear stress is expected to be a
function of the size of the soot fragment and its adhesiveness to the
soot cake/filter wall surface. Although the latter could be measured by
atomic force microscopy (AFM) [241], no numerical model has been
proposed to predict the size of the soot fragment produced during the
combustion of a soot cake. Since the detachment of soot fragments
depends on adhesion with the surface, the likelihood of soot migration
will change depending on whether the ash layer is present. This is
in agreement with experimental observations made by Matsuno and
Kitamura [259].

In addition to the regeneration-induced transport, migration of ash
due to shearing flow on the ash layer has been modelled by Konstan-
dopoulos et al. [268]. The governing equations for the ash mass fraction
suspended in the gas phase Yash and the ash layer thickness wash are

where vw is the through-wall gas flow velocity. The ash re-entrainment
flux Jash takes a non-zero pre-set value J0 if the local shear stress
exceeded the critical detachment shear stress and the local temperature
is lower than a critical value. The temperature constraint attempts
to capture the impact of the ash stickiness. In the model proposed
by Koltsakis et al. [266], the migration of the ash layer can be inhibited
if a soot cake is present on top of the ash layer, subject to a critical soot
cake mass constraint. The critical detachment shear stress of the ash
layer is a function of the local velocity and the local ash agglomerate
size. The following expression was used by Koltsakis et al. [266] to
describe the rate of agglomeration of primary ash particles ragglo

where C1, C2 and C3 are calibrated rate parameters. Eq. (122) is anal-
ogous to the Arrhenius equation, which C1 being the pre-exponential
constant, C2 being the ‘‘activation energy’’ of ash agglomeration and
the volume ratio of ash with respect to soot cake represents the impact
of ash ‘‘concentration’’.

Last but not least, a multi-channel model would be needed for an
accurate description of real ash loaded filters because ash deposition
patterns in real filters vary significantly between channels. Rubino et al.
[256] found that ash plugs had a half-elliptical distribution across filter
channels, where the longest plug was found in the centre channel. It is
apparent that more work is required to develop a filter model that can
accurately predicts the accumulation, migration and evolution of ash
deposits. The development of such a model will be supported by large
amount of experimental data. Non-destructive optical measurements
such as MRI and XRT will be helpful.

4.2. Impact of ash deposits on filter performance

Ash deposits in the filter can increase filter pressure drop via
different means depending on their form and location. Ash deposits
within the filter wall can lead to a reduction in the permeability of
the filter wall. The ash layer is a porous medium that gas has to flow
through in addition to the soot cake. The ash plug can influence the
momentum balance in inlet channels via reduction of the effective inlet
channel length. These can interfere with regeneration control strategies
that rely on the filter pressure drop as an input signal. In general, ash
deposition causes active regenerations to occur more frequently due to
the overestimation of the actual soot load [237]. Unnecessary active
regenerations can reduce the fuel economy of vehicles.

The impact of ash deposits on the permeability of the filter wall
is often neglected in modelling studies [141,269]. Kamp et al. [139]
published one of the few studies that did consider this. The following
equation has been used by Kamp et al. [139] to estimate the wall
permeability with soot load and ash load

where ̂Vsoot and ̂Vash are the volume ratio of soot and ash deposit with
respect to the total porous space within the wall. In principle, Eq. (39)
may be modified to capture the impact of deep bed ash deposits in the
unit collector model

where maw is the mass of ash deposits and ρaw is the packing density of
ash deposits within the filter wall. It should be noted that the value of
ρaw may increase during the lifetime of the filter as ash deposits undergo
sintering after multiple regeneration events.

Similar to the soot cake, Darcy’s law is often used to describe pres-
sure drop across the ash layer (Eq. (41)) [103,154,155,179,210,269].
Whilst the inertial resistance of the ash layer is often ignored in models,
experimental studies have shown that the pressure drop of ash-loaded
GPFs can have a quadratic relationship with space velocity which sug-
gests that ash-induced inertial pressure loss is not negligible [133]. The
permeability of the ash layer may be modelled analogously to that of
the soot cake as shown in Eq. (52). Wurzenberger et al. [205] proposed
such a model. The model considers a particle cake layer composed of
both soot and ash. The particle cake layer is discretised and Darcy’s
law is used to describe the pressure drop, with the permeability being
described as a function of the through-cake distance. The permeability
of the hybrid cake is described by Carmen–Kozeny equation

Ash plugs at the end of inlet channels have a smaller impact on
the filter pressure drop than the ash layer [111]. On the other hand,
mid-channel ash plugs can lead to a drastic change in velocity profiles
and a huge increase in pressure drop [270]. If a mid-channel ash plug
is impermeable to the gas flow, the effective length of the inlet channel
is reduced significantly. Despite its detrimental impact on the pressure
drop at channel-scale, the severity of mid-channel plug formation is
limited on the overall filter pressure drop as long as there are enough
clean channels because gas will preferably flow through paths with the
lowest resistances [261].

The formation of an ash layer generally leads to an increase in filtra-
tion efficiency [111,121,271,272]. Deep bed filtration is assumed to be
negligible once the ash layer is established. When the ash layer has not
been established, ash deposition within the filter wall can reduce the
duration of deep bed filtration [273]. The impact of ash deposits on the
filtration process plays a crucial role in the ash deposition pattern since
ash precursors are transported within soot particles. However, there are
at least three problems associated with physic-based filtration models
for ash deposits:

1. Deep bed ash deposits would have a different packing density
with respect to deep bed soot deposits as shown in Eq. (124).

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10104319

C.T. Lao et al.

2. The partition coefficient approach breaks down when an ash
layer is present since the soot cake would build on the surface
of the ash layer instead of the filter wall.

3. Whilst the filtration efficiency of the ash layer may be modelled
using Eq. (10), SEM images have shown that ash layers are quite
different from spherical packed beds [139,274]. It is challenging
to adequately describe the microstructure of the ash layer.

Ash can hinder mass transfer in catalysed filters [275]. Bagi et al.
[264] optically observed the wetting of substrate by ash deposits. The
gaseous reactant will have difficulty accessing the catalytic surface
due to ash masking. Ash layers can act as a diffusive barrier anal-
ogously to soot cake. It should be noted that the impact of ash on
the catalytic performance of filters depends on its composition. For
example, magnesium-based ash can promote soot regeneration better
than calcium-based ash [276].

The impact of ash on heat transfer would be similar to that of soot
as described in Section 2.5 albeit with different material properties.
Opposing comments about the role of ash on the thermal behaviour of
regenerating filters have been made in the literature. Chen et al. [179]
suggested that ash deposits can hinder heat transfer and lead to higher
peak temperature during active regeneration, whilst other researchers
have suggested that the overall heat capacity of the filter may be in-
creased by ash deposits, which reduces the peak temperature [76,273].
The impact of ash on heat transfer also depends on the distribution of
ash within particulate filters.

Ash deposits can undergo substantial microscopic change during
their lifetime in particulate filters. This substantially increases the
difficulty of modelling the impact of ash deposits. Whilst sintering
and other re-structuring phenomena of ash have been widely reported
in experimental studies, limited modelling studies have attempted to
consider the evolution of the properties of ash deposits. Linking the
microstructure of the ash deposits to their impact on pressure drop, fil-
tration and regeneration is vital for accurate filter models. In addition,
the irregular shape of ash deposits further complicates the issue. SEM
images have shown that the ash layer may not be formed by spherical
ash primary particles; rather it may be molten and have an irregular
structure [274]. Hollow ash particles can be formed due to sintering
over multiple regeneration events. Although most existing models using
an analogous treatment for the ash and soot deposits, describing aged
ash deposits as particles or aggregates is inconsistent with experimental
observations.

5. Summary

This paper has critically assessed how filtration, regeneration and
ash formation have been considered by particulate filter models. In
particular, the description of particle deposits is discussed in detail.

The filtration efficiency of filter walls can be estimated precisely
with pore-scale models using knowledge of the internal structure of
the filter wall that can be obtained by tomography. Soot aggregates
can be reasonably approximated as equivalent spherical particles in
pore-scale models. Correlations are available for the calculation of the
diameter and the density of the equivalent spherical particles. However,
the application of pore-scale models is limited due to computational
cost. They are rarely applied to study the impact of soot deposits on
the filtration behaviour of the walls. Channel-scale filtration models
remain the first choice for such tasks. They approximate the complex
internal structure of the porous wall using simple geometries, which
allow analytical expressions of the filtration efficiency to be derived.
Many expressions have been developed in the literature with subtle
differences between them. Simulations of pore-scale models can be a
useful benchmark for the evaluation of various channel-scale filtration
models.

As particles accumulate in a particulate filter, the pressure drop and
the filtration efficiency generally increases. The rates of the increase

in the pressure drop and filtration efficiency are closely related to the
packing of the trapped particles. The channel-scale models available in
the literature often consider the number of trapped particles on a mass
basis instead of a volume basis. This may compromise their ability to
predict filter behaviour when the incoming particles are polydisperse.
The transition from deep bed filtration to soot cake formation is an-
other important phenomenon to model. The deep bed filtration occurs
when particles are trapped in the walls of the filter. This eventually
gives way to cake filtration once a layer of particles is established on the
surface of the wall. The rate of transition is dependent on the clogging
of the surface pores and the filtration efficiency of the developing soot
cake. The saturation of the surface pores is usually modelled using a
partition coefficient approach by channel-scale models. It should be
noted that the calibration process of this approach is sensitive to the
spatial discretisation of the wall. Great caution should be taken when
quoting the values of the related model parameters. The filtration abil-
ity of the developing soot cake has been considered by recent modelling
studies. However, some models estimate the filtration behaviour of
the developing soot cake with equations that assume the presence of
a uniform porous medium, which is not an accurate description of a
developing soot cake.

The impact of mass transfer of gaseous species on the performance
of catalysed particulate filters is a complex subject. Since current
models rely on empirical tuning to obtain good agreement between
model results and experimental measurements, a model that is capable
of predicting the impact of soot deposits on the mass transfer of gaseous
species for a wide range of systems and operating conditions is not
expected to be developed in the near future. There is potential in
linking the gas phase mass transfer models for in-wall soot deposits
to the filtration model. This will allow better quantification of the
impact of soot deposits on the gas phase mass transfer phenomenon.
The impact of soot load on heat transfer within particulate filters has
not been studied in detail in the literature because it is not an important
factor in contrast to other factors such as operating condition and
substrate properties. Current approaches in the literature are deemed
adequate in this regard.

Regeneration reactions are described by Arrhenius-like equations.
Details of many chemical and physical phenomena are rarely explicitly
considered in channel-scale models. Their influences are lumped into
the values of calibrated parameters such as the pre-exponential con-
stant. This severely limits the applicability of the calibrated kinetics.
In particular, the change in the soot deposits during regeneration is
often oversimplified since many models only consider the mass of
remaining soot deposits. Consideration of the change in the morphology
of soot deposits during regeneration will allow a better description
of the regeneration process as well as the performances of partially
regenerated filters.

Furthermore, the change in soot deposits during regeneration is
closely related to the formation of ash deposits. There is plenty of
room for the development of ash formation models as they are scarce
compare to experimental studies on ash formation in the literature.
The development of the ash formation models will need support from
extensive experimental data in addition to filter pressure drop mea-
surements. Non-destructive optical measurements will be extremely
helpful in assisting the development of ash models. In addition, the
impact of ash deposits on filtration behaviour should be studied in
detail as it can feed back to the ash formation process. It is important to
understand that approximating ash deposits as spherical particles can
be inappropriate due to sintering of the ash during regeneration events.
Filter models have been developed and applied successfully in
the past, but further improvement can be made in various aspects.
Regarding impacts of particulates on filter behaviour, focusing on
phenomena occurring at the smaller length scales i.e. pore size and
particle size will be needed. Since the high computational cost limits
the applications of pore-scale models to clean filter walls with relatively
simple particle models, channel-scale models will remain the major tool

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10104320

C.T. Lao et al.

for predicting filter behaviour during the entire life cycle of the filter.
Extension of channel-scale models to consider pore-scale phenomena
will be needed to improve the predictive power of models. Further
development of channel-scale models can benefit from support by
experimental measurements and pore-scale models.
