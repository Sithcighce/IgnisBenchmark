    "question_text": "In microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), the anode reaction involves oxidation of organic compounds like acetate by electroactive microorganisms, releasing electrons and protons. The proton transport mechanism across ion exchange membranes (e.g., CEM, AEM, BPM) significantly impacts pH gradients and ohmic losses. From a combustion and energy engineering perspective, explain the thermodynamic basis and mass transfer mechanisms leading to pH imbalance in CEM-based systems, and quantify the additional energy input required per pH unit difference based on Nernst equation analysis.",
    "standard_answer": "In MECs utilizing a cation exchange membrane (CEM) like Nafion 117, the primary ion transport mechanism involves migration of cations (e.g., Na+, K+) rather than protons (H+), due to the higher concentration of competitive cations (typically 4–5 orders of magnitude higher than H+), resulting in a pH drop in the anode chamber and an increase in the cathode chamber. This pH gradient arises because CEMs conduct all cations present in the electrolyte, not selectively protons. This leads to thermodynamic inefficiencies. The theoretical cathode potential for hydrogen evolution under standard conditions (pH = 7.0) is E_cat = –0.414 V vs. SHE. The Nernst equation (E = E⁰ – (RT/nF)ln(Q)) governs the equilibrium voltage. For every pH unit difference, the cathode potential shifts by –0.059 V according to ΔE = –(0.059)ΔpH. For acetate oxidation (E_an = –0.300 V), the equilibrium voltage E_eq = E_cat – E_an = (–0.414) – (–0.300) = –0.114 V. A pH gradient of one unit increases the required voltage by 0.06 V, translating to an additional energy input of approximately 0.13 kWh per m³-H₂ per pH unit, as stated: 'every pH unit difference will increase Eeq by 0.06 V according to the Nernst equation, which means an additional energy input of ca. 0.13 kWh m³⁻¹-H₂ per pH unit.' Thus, pH imbalance directly escalates operational energy demands, undermining MEC efficiency.",

    "question_text": "In MEC platforms, cathodic catalysts are crucial for reducing overpotentials. Compare the electrochemical performance and durability of noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt) versus non-precious metal alternatives (e.g., NiFe LDH) in terms of exchange current density, activation energy, and poisoning susceptibility (e.g., by sulfide in real wastewater). Quantify the cost difference and discuss how catalyst selection impacts the net energy recovery in scaled-up systems.",
    "standard_answer": "Noble metal catalysts like Pt exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with exchange current densities on the order of 10⁻³ A cm⁻². However, their high cost (~$32.00 per 10×10 cm for Nafion 117) and sensitivity to poisoning limit their practicality. Non-precious alternatives such as NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) films on nickel foam achieve HER rates approaching that of Pt-loaded carbon cloth, while costing less than 5% of Pt/C catalyst. For instance, Pt-catalyzed carbon cloth cathodes achieve hydrogen production rates of ~2.1 m³ m⁻³ d⁻¹ at 1 V. Pt catalysts also deactivate rapidly in presence of sulfides commonly found in wastewater, with lifespans often below 100 h. In contrast, NiFe LDH showed HER (2.01–2.12 m³-H₂ m⁻³ d⁻¹). Durability and cost-effectiveness are paramount for real-world deployment.",
