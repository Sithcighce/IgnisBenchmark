Continuously sampling a ﬂame, burning at 1 atm., for mass spectrometry at ≈ 10 –8 
atm. seriously dis- 
turbs the ﬂame. Not only are a ﬂame’s temperature and velocity altered, often the composition of a 
sample is falsiﬁed. Thus, “fake” ions appear, even when sampling as quickly as possible, i.e. supersoni- 
cally, to quench chemical reactions. However, studying these spurious ions is fruitful. They arise, because 
a sample is unavoidably cooled; the drop in temperature causes a rapid chemical equilibrium to shift 
position and change the sample’s composition. That ions react faster than neutrals (to perturb a sample) 
magniﬁes the problem for ions. When continuously sampling a ﬂame, burning at 1 atm., through an inlet 
at the tip of a hollow, metallic nozzle, cooling can occur in three ways during the formation of a beam 
for mass spectrometry. Firstly, before a sample passes through the inlet hole to enter the supersonic ex- 
pansion into the ﬁrst vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer, it loses heat to the cooler, sampling 
nozzle, usually conical in shape. By detecting spurious ions from a ﬂame, this drop in temperature has 
been measured to be greatest ( ≈ 400 K) for the smallest oriﬁces. This cooling becomes smaller for larger 
holes and is trivial for diameters above 150 μm. Secondly, a sample cools (by maybe ≈ 300 K), whatever 
the oriﬁce’s size, on being accelerated to the local speed of sound in the narrowest part, i.e . the throat 
of the inlet oriﬁce. Thirdly, the drop in temperature in the subsequent, near-adiabatic expansion inside 
the nozzle is greatest ( ≈ 10 0 0 K) and most prolonged for the largest inlet holes (diam. > 150 μm). The 
upshot is that with a small hole (diam. < 100 μm), a sample is cooled by both the sampling nozzle and 
the acceleration to sonic velocity in the throat of the inlet. However, with a large oriﬁce (diam. > 150 
μm), cooling happens in the acceleration to a Mach number of unity and the following supersonic ex- 
pansion. Analysis shows that, if a positive ion reacts exothermally in a reversible reaction with a time 
constant briefer than ≈ 0.5 μs, that reaction will be equilibrated early in the ﬂame. In addition, if the 
oriﬁce is small, the equilibrium will be just fast enough to shift position to that for a temperature re- 
duced in both the thermal boundary layer around the inlet, and in accelerating to the speed of sound. 
Consequently, the sample begins the expansion with new species. When using a big oriﬁce, the reaction’s 
time constant (in the ﬂame) must be less than ≈ 0.05 μs (depending on the ﬂame) to generate new ions 
in the supersonic expansion. It follows that, if there is not an exothermic chemical reaction with a time 
constant less than ≈ 0.5 μs, sampling is most probably genuine. A similar criterion usually means that 
no fake neutral species are observed in a low-pressure ﬂame. Negative ions are complicated by their re- 
actions often involving free electrons. Being mobile, they often leave a sample to attach to the metallic 
sampling nozzle. This loss of free electrons changes the ionic composition, because rapid, steady-state re- 
lationships for individual negative ions are thereby shifted, with the change in composition depending on 
the oriﬁce’s size. A theme of this review is that these problems can be identiﬁed and resolved by repeat- 
ing observations using sampling oriﬁces with a range of different diameters. The resulting measurements 
are then extrapolated to a hole size of either zero or inﬁnity, when there is no effect of a perturbation 
in either the expansion or the boundary layer; this yields a measurement, e.g . of an equilibrium con- 
stant, for the known conditions in the neck of the oriﬁce. In addition, applying a voltage between the 
burner and the sampling nozzle considerably improves the accuracy, with which ionic concentrations are 
measured. Consequently, many rapid reactions have had their equilibrium constants measured, yielding

1. Introduction 

Generally speaking, reactions of ions in the gas phase, e.g . in a 
ﬂame, are likely to be faster than those involving only uncharged 
species. For example, the rate constants of the reactions: 

H 3 O + + e − → 2 H + OH 

CHO + + H 2 O → H 3 O + + CO 

(I) 

(II) 

at ﬂame temperatures of ∼ 20 0 0 K are, respectively, k 1 ∼ 3 × 10 −7 
ml ions −1 s −1 [1–6] and k 2 ∼ 7 × 10 −9 ml ions −1 s −1 [ 1 , 2 , 7 ] for re- 
actions (I) and (II). Neither reaction has an activation energy. This 
makes the exothermic recombination of a free electron with a pos- 
3 O +  in (I) possibly the fastest chemical 
itively charged ion like H 

reaction  in  the  gas  phase.  The  origin  of  this  rapidity  lies  in  the 
long–range force of attraction between the two electrically charged 
reactants, one of which is exceptionally light and consequently ex- 
ceedingly  mobile.  Likewise,  the  exothermic  transfer  of  a  proton 
2 O in (II) is inherently rapid, partly because it too 
from CO to H 
does not have an activation energy barrier [1–7] . In particular, re- 
action  (II)  involves  an  attractive  force  between  the  positive  ion, 
CHO + , and the polar molecule H 
2 O. These rate constants for ionic 
reactions compare with a pre-exponential factor of k 3 ∼ 4 × 10 −11 
ml molecule −1  s −1  [8] for the exothermic reaction of uncharged 
species in: 

OH + H 2 → H + H 2 O ; (cid:2)H 0 

3 ≈ −63 kJ mo l −1 

(III) 

Such a value for the pre-exponential factor of k 3 is close to the 
gas-kinetic upper limit for non-ionic reactants. Of course, reaction

(III), unlike (I) and (II) has an activation energy; this fact renders it 
even slower in practice. 

The fact that ionic reactions are faster than those of uncharged 
species results in them being quicker at approaching equilibrium 
in a ﬂame. This ultimate situation of a reaction being at equilib- 
rium can be deﬁned as when the rates of a forward and its reverse 
reaction become effectively equal. For example, the characteristic 
time (or time constant or relaxation time [9] ) for reaction (II) to 
attain equilibrium in a ﬂame is: 
τeq 2 ≈ 1 / { k 2 ( C H2O + C CO / K 2 ) } . 

(1) 

Here K 2  is the equilibrium constant of (II); other symbols are 
deﬁned in the nomenclature. This means that if the smaller, second 
term in the denominator of Eq. (1) is neglected, τ eq2 < 1/ k 2 C 
H2O . 
Consequently, in a ﬂame at 1 bar and 20 0 0 K, with H 
2 O having 
H2O = 3.5 × 10 17  molecules  ml −1 ,  the 
a  mole  fraction  of  0.1,  so  C 
time constant τ eq2 becomes less than 4 × 10 −10 s. This, of course, 
is very brief, meaning that in practice reaction (II) is likely to be 
equilibrated in such a ﬂame. As for reaction (III) involving neutral 
species, the rate constant of the forward step is k 3 = 4.2 × 10 −11 exp 
( −22 kJ/mol/RT) ml molecule −1  s −1  [8] , giving k 3 = 1.1 × 10 −11 ml 
molecule −1 s −1 at 20 0 0 K. By the above argument, the time con- 
stant  for  reaction  (III)  to  attain  equilibrium, τ eq3 ,  is  slightly  less 
than (1/ k 3 C 
H2 ). Thus with a ﬂame at 1 bar and 20 0 0 K, but with 
H2 = 3 × 10 17 molecule ml −1 , it turns out that τ eq3 < 3 × 10 −7 s. 
C 
Of course, if the pressure in the ﬂame were reduced below 1 bar 
by a factor of 10, τ eq3 would increase tenfold to ≈ 3 μs.

All this matters, when a ﬂame burning at either atmospheric or 
a lower pressure is sampled continuously into a mass spectrome- 
ter, operating usually at an ultimate pressure of ∼ 10 −5  mbar or 
probably less.  Such sampling usually  involves a small portion of 
the ﬂame gas passing through a tiny oriﬁce (diam. < 0.3 mm) and 
expanding  supersonically  and  almost  adiabatically  into  the  ﬁrst 
vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer. The mechanics of such 
sampling are described below, but here it is suﬃcient to note that 
for various reasons, the process cools the sample rapidly. Suppose 
the gaseous sample spends a time t samp  being both sampled and 
cooled,  then  it  follows  that  if,  for  example,  τ eq2  <<  t samp ,  it  is 
likely  that  equilibrium (II)  will  be  shifted  to  its  right-hand  side, 
i.e. in the exothermic direction, during sampling. In that case, the 
composition measured by the mass spectrometer will not be that 
of  the  original  sample,  but  one  for  some  relatively  low  temper- 
ature encountered during sampling. This phenomenon forms the 
basis of this review. First, it is necessary to look at a typical mass 
spectrometer and its sampling system. One item of particular in- 
terest will be the residence time of the sample, where its temper- 
ature and pressure fall rapidly until collisions cease in the sam- 
ple.  Another  concern  will  be  what  happens  to  a  sample  from  a 
ﬂame, when it passes through the oriﬁce in the wall separating the 
ﬂame from the ﬁrst vacuum chamber, where usually a molecular 
(or ionic) beam forms for subsequent analysis in the mass spec- 
trometer.

2.1. Mass spectrometry of reacting neutral species 

It is important to examine early work on the mass spectrom- 
etry of reacting gaseous mixtures, not necessarily ﬂames, partic- 
ularly bearing in mind that an early preoccupation was detecting 
free radicals, particularly ones like HO 
2 , which were then novel. 
In fact, Cuthbert’s early review [10] describes the ﬁrst mass spec- 
trometer of the pioneering Eltenton [11] . Subsequently, there were 
developments from Lossing and Tickner [ 10 , 12 , 13 ], as well as Foner 
and Hudson [ 10 , 14 ]. Some of these workers actually studied ﬂames 
[ 11 , 14 ]. In particular, Foner and Hudson’s molecular beam sampling 
system [14] was an important prototype and is depicted in Fig. 1 . 
This early work recognised the problems of sampling hot reacting 
gases.  For  example,  free  radicals  react  with  surfaces  and  so  can 
generate spurious (fake) species. Usually, a single pin-hole (diam. 
50 - 250 μm) was punched (with a tungsten needle) in a thin sheet

of Au [ 11 , 14 ] or Pt separating the reacting mixture from the ﬁrst 
vacuum  chamber of  the  mass spectrometer.  Alternatively,  a  hole 
was sparked in the thin end of a quartz or glass thimble [12] to 
form the sampling oriﬁce. 

Fig.  1  shows  a  cross-section  through  Foner  and  Hudson’s 
[14] molecular beam sampling system. The ﬂame burned at a re- 
duced pressure (of ≈ 10 −2  bar) against the pinhole (diam. 0.025 
to 0.114 mm) punched in gold foil, 0.025 mm thick. Gas from the 
ﬂame passed through this oriﬁce as a sonic jet, perforce charac- 
terised  by a  Mach  number of  unity  at  the  narrowest part.  Then 
it expanded supersonically into a chamber continuously pumped 
down to ≈ 5 × 10 −3 mbar. Foner and Hudson estimated [14] that 
molecular collisions in the supersonic expansion lasted for ≈ 1 μs. 
Thus,  for  a  chemical  equilibrium  to  be  shifted  during  the  asso- 
ciated, huge, adiabatic cooling requires that the time constant of 
the equilibrium be less than 1 μs. In the ﬁrst chamber, the beam 
travelled only 45.4 mm and was chopped before passing through 
a moveable nozzle into a second chamber, where further expan- 
sion occurred. The third and ﬁnal chamber, held at ≈ 10 −6 mbar, 
housed the ion source, where the sampled gas was subjected to 
an electron beam of up to ∼ 80 V in energy. The resulting ions 
were analysed in a 90 o  magnetic ﬁeld, providing information on 
their masses, as well as on the likely identity and concentration of 
neutral species in the ﬂame. Chopping the molecular beam in the 
ﬁrst vacuum chamber, together with using phase sensitive detec- 
tion, ensured good signals with low noise from the magnetic mass 
spectrometer. The electron multiplier was surrounded by a radia- 
tion shield to permit bake-out. This early work was followed by 
Kistiakowsky and Kydd’s [15] use of a time of ﬂight mass spec- 
trometer, instead of a magnetic instrument, to examine the prod- 
ucts from ﬂash photolysing various gases. Early work included a 
study  of  methane  ﬂames  by Westenberg  and  Fristrom  [ 16 , 17 ]  in 
1960. 

One important group using mass spectrometry to study neutral 
species in ﬂames was Wagner’s in Göttingen. There were consider- 
able developments over the years, but Homann [18] has given an 
early  general  description.  Low  pressure  ﬂames  were  investigated 
using  two  vacuum  chambers  [18–20]  and  molecular  beam  sam- 
pling through a hole at the tip of a conical nozzle. Later, the tradi- 
tional ion source was replaced [21] by resonant, multi-photon ion- 
isation (REMPI) of neutral species, some of which had large masses 
(up  to  ∼ 30 0 0  a.m.u.)  in  sooting  ﬂames.  Another  development 
was  the  reﬂectron  time-of-ﬂight  mass  spectrometer  for  study- 
ing polyaromatic and other relatively heavy species [22] in sooty 
ﬂames. 

Subsequent  apparatus  and  mass  spectrometric  studies  of  un- 
charged species in ﬂames have been reviewed by Biordi [23] for 
the period up to 1977. The results of some subsequent mass spec- 
trometric studies of neutral species in ﬂames were thoroughly re- 
viewed in 2009 [24] . A fairly recent, good general description of 
the mass spectrometry of neutral species, i.e . molecules and radi- 
cals, has been given by Korobeinichev [25] . 

2.2. Review of the mass spectrometry of ions in ﬂames 

Electrically charged species in ﬂames were studied almost con- 
temporaneously  with  the  above  mentioned,  early  mass  spectro- 
metric studies of neutral molecules and radicals. At ﬁrst, ions were 
investigated quite independently by three groups, whose primary 
purpose was to identify the charged species in a variety of ﬂames. 
There  were  also  then  questions  as  to  whether  highly  diffusive, 
free  electrons  played  a  rôle  in  propagating  a  ﬂame.  Also,  in  a 
sooting ﬂame of  a  hydrocarbon, did small ions act  as nuclei for 
soot? Certainly, soot particles were known to often carry an elec- 
tric charge. The early history of the mass spectrometry of ions in 
ﬂames has been related in three papers, published in one tome,

Fig. 2.  Knewstubb and Sugden’s [37] sampling system for preparing a beam of ions of one sign of charge. The ions originated in a ﬂame burning at atmospheric pressure 
horizontally against the plate, B and ﬁnally entered a magnetic mass spectrometer on the right (not shown) for identiﬁcation. 

by  the  pioneers:  van  Tiggelen  [26]  in  Belgium,  Sugden  [27]  in 
England  and  Calcote  [28]  in  the  U.S.A.  It  is  not  possible  to  say 
which of these three was the ﬁrst, but van Tiggelen’s group [29–
33] in Belgium appears to have a case for being ﬁrst, possibly fol- 
lowed  very  closely  by  Sugden’s  [34–37]  and  then  Calcote’s  [38–
41] .  Their  different  instruments  had  three  differentially  pumped 
vacuum chambers. Van Tiggelen [26] burned ﬂames at a reduced 
pressure of ≈ 10 −2  bar, as well as at 1 bar; his ﬂames were di- 
rected against a ﬂat sheet of polished “lava”, in which was a rel- 
atively huge hole (diam. 2 mm), through which ﬂame gas passed. 
Immediately behind the oriﬁce was pressed a rotating disk, which 
only allowed samples to enter the next vacuum chamber for short 
periods of ∼ 4.5 ms to avoid overheating. This instrument’s sam- 
pling system was later altered [42] to give continuous sampling of 
a ﬂame through a stainless steel, conical nozzle with a hole at its 
tip. 

Sugden  and  Knewstubb  [27]  concentrated  on  the  continuous 
sampling  of  ﬂames,  burning  at  the  higher  pressure  of  1  atm., 
through a hole (diam. ∼ 0.05 mm) pricked in platinum foil, 0.05 
mm  thick.  Their  [37]  instrument  is  depicted  in  Fig.  2 ,  where  it 
will be noticed that electric ﬁelds directed and focussed a beam 
of ions into a second and then a third vacuum chamber for mag- 
netic analysis of their mass to charge ratios. Sugden’s group was 
aware [ 1 , 2 , 27 ] that they might have been observing spurious ions 
formed  unintentionally,  whilst  a  sample  was  cooled  on  passing 
through the inlet oriﬁce into the ﬁrst vacuum chamber. Thus, they

took pains to prove that H 
In fact, Fig. 2 shows that the oriﬁce at the centre of the platinum 
foil is located in a slight recess in the water-cooled, front plate. Of 
course, only the gas, which is close to the central axis through the 
inlet oriﬁce, passes through that hole and thereby constitutes the 
sample. This means that  the gas  surrounding the sample has to 
move somewhat awkwardly out of the recess and then sideways 
and away from the axis, parallel to the face of the front plate. Cou- 
pled with this is the problem with an oriﬁce pricked in metallic 

5 

foil is that it has a jagged edge, which interferes with the passage 
of gas from the ﬂame into the ﬁrst chamber. 

An early success [34] of these workers was to show that the al- 
kaline earths formed molecular ions like SrOH + in a ﬂame, seeded 
with  a  trace  quantity  of  strontium.  Also,  it  became  clear  that 
2  or  a  hydrocarbon  as  the  fuel,  contained  several 
ﬂames,  with  H 
ions, which were hydrates of other ions [34–37] . Usually the free 
electron was the major negatively charged entity, along with much 
smaller amounts of OH − and O 
2 –. Of course, an early puzzle was 
+ , in a hydrocarbon ﬂame 
how the ﬁrst ions, e.g . CHO + and C 
3 H 
3 
were created, because at that time it seemed that a ﬂame was in- 
suﬃciently hot to generate these energetic species in such appar- 
ently copious amounts. 

As an interesting aside, it is worth noting that Knewstubb and 
+ growing in concentra- 
Sugden [37] found the ions NO + and NH

tion along the burned gas ( i.e . that region of a ﬂame downstream 
of its luminous reaction zone) of a premixed ﬂame of H 
2 , 
in the absence of any hydrocarbons. Here is an example of the ions 
observed actually revealing the chemistry of neutral species in the 
ﬂame. Thus, the formation of NO +  is probably caused by the se- 
quence: 

2 + N 

2 + O 

O + N 2 → NO + N 

N + O → NO + + e −. 

(IV) 

However,  NO +  might  also  be  created  by  transfer  of  a  proton 
3 O + , to NO [43] , followed by dis- 
from the dominant positive ion, H 
sociation of HNO + to give NO + . The ion NH 
+ is likely to be the 
4 
product of the sequence: 
N + H 2 (cid:2) NH + H 
NH + H 2 (cid:2) N H 2 + H 
N H 2 + H 2 (cid:2) N H 3 + H 
NH 3 + H 3 O + → NH 4 

+ + H 2 O

particularly in a fuel-rich ﬂame. The Zel’dovich reaction (IV) and 
also (V) have been studied directly [ 44 , 45 ] in H 
2 ﬂames. Re- 
action (V) [43] , also involves proton-transfer, which is mentioned 
again below. As an alternative to reaction (IV) for attacking N 
2 , an- 
other forming N 

2 H [ 44 , 46 ], is worthy of attention: 

2 + O 

H + N 2 → NNH 

O + NNH → NO + NH. 

(VI) 

2 + O 

2 + N 

Of course, another very likely possibility (as an alternative to 
3  was 
the  well-established  reactions  (IV)–(VI),  is  that  some  NH 
2  reacting  on  the  platinum 
2  and  H 
produced  catalytically  by  N 
around the sampling oriﬁce, when sampling a fuel-rich ﬂame of 
H 
2 ,  as  suspected  by  Knewstubb  and  Sugden  [37] .  The 
matter  merits  further  study,  but  this  does  seem  to  be  the  only 
known case of the metal around an inlet oriﬁce being suspected 
of generating a new species heterogeneously. Certainly, sampling 
nozzles  made  from  nickel  or  chromium,  as  discussed  below,  are 
inactive in this respect. 

Calcote’s work [41] on low-pressure ﬂames is notable for ini- 
tially using a Bennett, radio-frequency mass ﬁlter, instead of a con- 
ventional,  magnetic  spectrometer.  The  instrument  is  depicted  in 
Fig.  3 ,  which  reveals  its  complexity,  as  well  as  the  use  of  cryo- 
genic pumping [41] , also employed by Knewstubb and Sugden [37] . 
Much later, Calcote used a radio-frequency, quadrupole mass spec- 

trometer [ 47 , 48 ]. Also, they used a conical, stainless steel sampling 
nozzle with a ﬂat end in which the sampling oriﬁce (diam. 0.25 
mm; length 0.2 mm) was drilled [41] . One early conclusion was 
that only singly charged ions exist in ﬂames. In fact, there is no 
reason why doubly charged ions should not exist, particularly for 
large hydrocarbon species. However, a doubly charged ion has only 
been established for I ++ [49] . 

The next mass spectrometer for studying ions in ﬂames appears 
to  have  been  constructed  by  Hayhurst  and  Sugden  [50] .  It  was 
the ﬁrst to use a radio-frequency, quadrupole mass spectrometer 
(a home-made one, because commercial ones were then unavail- 
able), which was much smaller than a magnetic instrument. This 
reduction of scale enabled them to use only two vacuum cham- 
bers, instead of three, for continuously investigating a ﬂame at at- 
mospheric pressure. The main advantage of this turns out to derive 
from one operating diﬃculty of all these instruments being that 
deposits form on surfaces [37] , especially around oriﬁces and on 
ion-lenses. These deposits become electrically charged and conse- 
quently disturb the beam of ions. This meant that the fewer ori- 
ﬁces and lenses, the better, leading to a more reproducible trans- 
mission  of  ions  through  an  instrument.  Fig.  4  shows  the  origi- 
nal  instrument  [50]  after  slight  modiﬁcations  [51]  to  accommo- 
date larger diffusion pumps for both vacuum chambers, the sec- 
ond of which protrudes into the ﬁrst. Because it was used in sev- 
eral observations mentioned below, it will now be described more 
fully.

(non-magnetic) housing for the quadrupole rods in the second chamber; it is normally at − 288 V for studying positive ions, E: gate-valve, which can be lowered to seal off
the entrance to the second chamber. This gate-valve is useful when changing the front plate to one with a differently sized sampling oriﬁce, without breaking the vacuum in 
the second chamber. F: four plates constituting an immersion lens to focus and shift the beam of positive ions, G: aperture deﬁning the ions’ entrance into the quadrupolar 
ﬁeld, diam. 0.38–1.0 mm, H: electrode to extract ions from the quadrupole assembly of four parallel rods, J: Faraday cup at − 50 V, for collecting the selected ions, whose 
current was measured with a sensitive ampliﬁer. 

A  sample  of  the  gas  from  a  chosen  point  in  a  ﬂame  con- 
tinuously  passed  through  a  circular  hole  at  the  tip  of  a  hol- 
low,  conical  nozzle  (60 o ),  made  of  chromium  or  nickel,  shown 
in Fig. 5 . Gas passed through the inlet oriﬁce into a conical ex- 
pansion  duct  (angle  60 o ).  In  the  ﬁrst  vacuum  chamber  the  ions 
soon  encounter  a  skimmer  electrode  (see  Fig.  4 ),  which  for  de- 
tecting positive ions had a small ( ∼ 90 V) negative voltage with 
respect to the outer, earthed, vacuum enclosure. This skimmer re- 
jected most negatively charged ions and any free electrons, but at- 
tracted positive ions through the hole at its tip. It was later re- 
placed [52] by a cylindrical electrode, looking like a wedding ring 
and also shown in Fig. 5 ; the result was that higher ion signals 
were observed. Another feature was that all the surfaces exposed 
to the ion-beam were gold-plated, so that they could be easily kept 
clean. 

The  Méker  burner,  shown  in  Fig.  5 ,  was  moveable  in  a  hor- 
izontal  direction,  so  that  points  along  the  ﬂame’s  axis  could  be 
sampled.  One  critical  distance  is  that  between  the  burner  and 
the electroformed sampling nozzle in its water-cooled plate, also 
shown in Fig. 5 . Subsequent versions of the instrument, illustrated 
in Figs. 4 and 5 , have been described [ 52 , 53 ]. The quadrupole mass 
spectrometer had a mass range from ∼ 4 up to almost 200 a.m.u., 
making it useful for studying the ionisation of metals, such as the 
alkali metals [54] or alkaline earths [55] , which were added to a 
ﬂame’s  unburnt  gases  in  trace  amounts.  However,  removing  the 
d.c. components of the voltages on the quadrupole rods (so that 
only the a.c. supply at 2.2 MHz remained) had the result that, in- 

7 

stead of detecting only ions close to a selected mass, M, ions from 
mass M up to inﬁnity were registered [56] . This meant that infor- 
mation on heavy ions became available. 

Fig. 6 shows more of the critical parts of these instruments, i.e . 
the burner and sampling system, together with one type of pre- 
mixed ﬂame, burning at atmospheric pressure, to give piston-ﬂow 
in  the  burned  gas.  Only  a  little  gas  ( ≈ 1  ml/s,  measured  at  the 
ﬂame’s temperature and pressure) passed from close to the ﬂame’s 
axis and through the oriﬁce (diam. 0.05–0.22 mm) at the tip of 
a hollow sampling cone [59] with walls ∼ 0.1 mm thick. In fact, 
in Fig. 6 the sample is bounded by a stagnation streamline, which 
deﬁnes the sample. Consequently only gas less than ∼ 1 mm off
the ﬂame’s axis was sampled, depending on the diameter of the 
oriﬁce. The sampling nozzle was electroformed from either nickel 
(melts at 1455 °C) or chromium (melts at 1830 °C), by slowly elec- 
troplating a carefully machined brass former with e.g . a layer of 
chromium (thickness ∼ 140 μm), later shaping the outside by turn- 
ing it in a lathe and ﬁnally dissolving away the brass. The resulting 
conical, hollow, nozzle was housed in a water-cooled, brass plate. 
When sampling a ﬂame of H 
2 at 2300 K, the tip of a Cr 
nozzle glowed red, indicating the metal there was at ≈ 1350 K. It 
is important that the sampling nozzle be metallic and an electri- 
cal conductor, to ensure that the ions under study experience well- 
deﬁned electrical ﬁelds in both vacuum chambers. Thus, it was im- 
portant to maintain a daily cleaning routine to prevent the build- 
up of deposits, which might carry electrical charges capable of dis- 
turbing the motion of what is a focussed beam of ions. It is clear

tance of this is discussed below, but it was possible to measure 
mass spectra for ∼ 5 different inlet oriﬁces in one afternoon. Fi- 
nally, it is worth stressing that, during the sampling of a wide va- 
riety of ﬂames, with sampling cones made of nickel or chromium, 
there was no reason to suspect that these metals created spurious 
species (either charged or uncharged) by e.g . catalytic reactions on 
their surfaces.

Figs.  6  and  7  show  the  Méker  burner,  which  was  really  144 
hypodermic tubes (i.d. 0.59 mm; o.d. 0.79 mm) glued parallel to 
one  another  (with  epoxy)  in  a  close-packed  bundle  and  held  in 
the water-cooled assembly, shown in Fig. 5 . On the end of each 
hypodermic tube sat a visible, conical reaction zone, from which 
the burned gases merged together, with radial differences in the 
axial  velocity  quickly  “ironed  out”.  Fig.  7  shows  a  typical  ﬂame 
2 + 1.0 O 
(unburned composition 3.0 H 
2 , with a measured 
steady temperature in the burned gas of 2400 K). Without an addi- 
tive the ﬂame is almost invisible, but that in Fig. 7 was made visi- 
ble by adding 0.5 vol. % of acetylene to the supplies to the burner, 
as well as nebulising a solution of LiCl, to render the burned gas 
red. The luminous turquoise reaction zone sitting on each oriﬁce 
in the face of the burner is clear. The core of the early part of a 
ﬂame had laminar (non-turbulent), piston-ﬂow. Fig. 6 shows a set 
of streamlines for the burned gas. The third one of them away from 
the axis of symmetry is a stagnation streamline and divides the 
ﬂow into two parts. There is ﬁrst the central “sample”, made up 
of gas entering the conical expansion duct and subsequently the 
ﬁrst vacuum chamber. Otherwise, there is the rest of the burned 
gas,  which  merely  moves  off into  the  laboratory’s  air-extraction 
system.  Close  examination  of  Fig.  6  reveals  a  thermal  boundary 
layer covering the sampling nozzle’s exterior, adjacent to the ﬂame. 
There are temperature gradients in the gas inside such a bound- 
ary layer. Some of the hot sample passes through this boundary 
layer, thereby undergoing cooling, before passing through the in- 
let oriﬁce. Consequently, gas near the axis of symmetry will not be 
cooled as much as the sample farther off the axis and so moving 
closer  to  the  cooler  nozzle.  Fig.  6  clariﬁes  the  nature  of  a  sam- 
ple  and  how  it  is  cooled  before  entering  the  near-adiabatic,  su- 
personic expansion inside the conical nozzle. The sample is con- 
strained to move with a Mach number of unity at the narrowest 
part (the throat) of the inlet [ 53 , 59 ]. Of course, in accelerating to 
a Mach number of unity ( i.e . the local velocity is the local speed

from Fig. 6 that the inlet oriﬁce has a ratio of (length / diameter) 
considerably less than unity; this looks to be the best achieved so 
far, ensuring minimal contact between the sample and the metallic 
sampling cone. Also, an electroformed sampling nozzle was an im- 
provement on a hole pricked in metallic foil, which was sometimes 
secured in a conspicuous recess in a water-cooled plate [ 1 , 50 ] and 
consequently not fully exposed to the hot ﬂame gases, as noted in 
Fig. 2 . Some of these holes pricked in metallic foil, in contrast to 
that in Fig. 6 , often had ragged edges, capable of disturbing the 
sample’s ﬂow. It is also worth noting that a crucial feature of this 
instrument in Figs. 4 to 6 was that the water-cooled front plate 
could be easily and quickly removed and replaced by another plate, 
housing a nozzle with a differently sized inlet oriﬁce. The impor-

Fig. 7.  Photograph of the face of the burner. This ﬂame’s unburned gas had a composition of 3.0 H 2 + 1.0 O 2 + 3.0 N 2 by volume. It had a steady temperature along the 
burned gas of 2400 K. To make the reaction zone visible, acetylene (0.5 vol. %) was added to the burner supplies; also an aqueous solution of LiCl was nebulised into them 
to colour the burnt gas red. 

of sound), there is “aerodynamic cooling” of the sample; its extent 
is estimated below. With unit Mach number, the ﬂow then has a 
Reynolds number of ∼ 100 (based on an inlet oriﬁce with a diam- 
eter of 0.10 mm), indicating that viscous forces on the sample are 
negligible. In the expansion duct, the Mach number becomes pro- 
gressively larger than unity, so the sample experiences yet more 
cooling, whilst it expands to a terminal Mach number of ≈ 7, when 
collisions cease. Altogether then, a sample is cooled in three dis- 
tinct ways: by losing heat to the cooler nozzle, by accelerating to 
a Mach number of unity in the throat of the nozzle and ﬁnally in 
the supersonic expansion. 

Another improvement to the instrument shown in Figs. 4 and 
5  was  to apply a  voltage [60]  between an  electrically ﬂoating 
burner and the earthed sampling nozzle and its mounting plate. 
The result of applying such an electric ﬁeld was that the number 
of positive ions detected sometimes rose (but only by ∼ 10 %) to a 
maximum, when the sampling nozzle and plate became at a more 
positive voltage than the burner. However, the rise depended on 
the electron density in the ﬂame. Thus, when the electron den- 
sity was relatively large ( ≥ ∼ 10 10  ml −1 ), increasing the positive 
voltage on the sampling cone had no effect on the current of de- 
tected positive ions [60] . However, the effect of an applied voltage 
was signiﬁcantly greater with a lower electron density; then the 
number of negative ions detected rose signiﬁcantly more than the 
positive ions did to a maximum, found at a different positive volt- 
age on the sampling cone. These matters are discussed in detail 
below; here it is suﬃcient to note that a small negative voltage 
totally prevented the detection of negative ions, but only slightly 
reduced the number of positive ions observed. The origin of these 
observations lies in a ﬂame being a plasma [61] , which happens 
to consist of more positively charged ions than negatively charged 
ones. The difference is made up of free electrons, which guaran- 
tee overall charge-neutrality. Consequently, covering the sampling 
cone and the burner are ion-sheaths, in which steep changes oc- 
cur in the local electrical potential [60] . The origin of these ﬁelds, 
adjacent to either a sampling nozzle or burner, lies in the equipar- 
tition of energy and the miniscule mass of an electron. The result 

is that free electrons, being extremely mobile, are likely to move 
from a ﬂame and attach to any piece of metal, such as the sam- 
pling nozzle. Consequently, even when the sampling system and 
burner are both earthed, a sheath of positive ions covers the tip 
of the sampling nozzle; the sheath’s thickness is usually “several”
Debye lengths, one of which is given [62] by:

for a ﬂame at a temperature T 
f = 2400 K and 
trons, n e , is the number per ml. For example, if T 
n e = 3 × 10 9  ml −1 ,  then λD  =  62  μm.  The  outcome  of  all  this  is 
that some electrons do not pass through the inlet oriﬁce in Figs. 
4–6 [63] , especially when n e  is lower at ≈ 10 7  ml −1  and λD  has 
increased to 1.1 mm, so the sheath is thick enough to cover most 
inlet oriﬁces. Then electrons are collected on the sampling nozzle, 
instead of passing through the inlet oriﬁce. Likewise, it is possible 
that a few positive ions follow them [ 61 , 64 ]. Here is a good exam- 
ple of the composition of a sample from a ﬂame being perturbed 
seriously by sampling. Of course, one way of estimating any such 
loss of ions is to vary the voltage between the burner and sam- 
pling plate and observe the detected ion currents. Applying a volt- 
age between the electrically ﬂoating burner and the earthed sam- 
pling system turns out to have another important use. This is that 
it provides a good way [65] of calibrating the delivery of the atom- 
iser used to add a ﬁne mist of an aqueous solution of a salt, such 
as CsCl, to the gas supplied to the burner. In turn, this enables the 
response of the mass spectrometer to be calibrated [65] , because 
a small quantity of Cs is fully ionised in a ﬂame of ≈ 2400 K or 
above. 

It was mentioned above that removing the d.c. components of 
the voltages supplied to the quadrupole rods of the mass ﬁlter had 
the result that only ions from a pre-selected mass up to inﬁnity 
were detected [56] . This enabled heavy ions, beyond the normal 
mass range of the quadrupole mass spectrometer and also of ei- 
ther sign, to be observed, admittedly in a slightly limited manner, 
in ﬂames, which were either sooting or close to the point of soot- 
ing [66–68] . Finally, it should be noted that the distance from the

sampling oriﬁce to the entrance to the second vacuum chamber 
in  Fig.  5  was  as  low  as  50  mm.  It  can  be  shown  [ 1 , 2 , 53 , 59 , 62 ] 
that there is continuum ﬂow (dominated by molecular collisions) 
of gas passing from a ﬂame through the sampling oriﬁce and in the 
early parts of the 60 o  expansion duct. However, after expanding 
almost adiabatically and supersonically, the ﬂow quickly changes 
(after a residence time of ≈ 1 μs) to become molecular,  i.e .  the 
mean free path then exceeds the internal diameter of the expan- 
sion duct. After this change and before an ion enters the second 
chamber, an ion experiences far less than one collision on aver- 
age. In addition, some potential complications appear to have been 
avoided with the arrangements in Figs. 4 and 5 . For example, ions 
enter the second chamber (pumped at its rear) before a Mach disk 
and barrel shock [62] would have otherwise formed in the absence 
of a second chamber. In fact, the Mach disk and barrel shock are 
normally located at a distance downstream of the inlet equal to 
f /  P ) 1/2  [62] .  Here  d t  is  the  diameter  of  the  narrowest 
0.67  d t  ( p 
f  is the pressure in the ﬂame and 
part (the throat) of the inlet, p 
P ( ∼ 4 × 10 –7 bar) is the pressure in the ﬁrst chamber. Thus, even 
with a small d t = 0.05 mm, the disk is at ∼ 55 mm ( i.e . beyond the 
ﬁrst chamber), so that gas entering the second chamber has not 
been affected by a Mach disk or barrel shock.

It  was  important  to  check  whether  the  sensitivity  of  the  in- 
strument  of  Figs.  4–6  depended  on  the  mass  of  the  ion  under 
observation.  This  was  investigated  by  nebulising  [65]  an  aque- 
ous solution of the chloride of an alkali metal, A, as a ﬁne mist, 
which was added to the gases supplied to a pre-mixed, fuel-rich 
ﬂame of H 
2 . In this case, tiny crystals of ACl appeared 
early  in  a  ﬂame.  Then,  most  probably,  melting  and  boiling  pro- 
duced free molecules of ACl, which were quickly attacked by hy- 
drogen atoms in: ACl + H → A + HCl within the reaction zone. Thus, 
the  alkali  existed  early  in  the  ﬂame  as  free  atoms,  A,  (charac- 
terised  by  the  colourful  emission  of  light),  as  well  as  molecules 
of  its  stable  hydroxide,  AOH  [ 54 , 69–73 ],  formed  very  rapidly  in: 
A + H 
2 O = AOH + H. Equilibrium was attained by thermal ionisation 
[ 54 , 74–78 ] in: 

A + M = A + + e – + M, 

(VII) 

where M is any molecule acting as a “third body”. Thus the ﬂame 
contained [74–79] only two principal charged species, A + , and free 
electrons, e –; their concentrations were equal to each other to en- 
sure a balance of charges. It can be shown that, if the concentra- 
tion of free metal atoms in a ﬂame is less than K 7 /4, where K 7 
is the equilibrium constant of reaction (VII), all the metal added 
will  be  fully  ionised  at  equilibrium.  Of  course,  there  is  the  fur- 
ther  condition,  that  the  rate  of  ionisation  in  (VII)  must  be  fast 
enough for equilibrium to be in effect attained in the time avail- 
able (of < 2 ms) in one of these ﬂames. The published rate co- 
eﬃcients for reaction (VII) [ 54 , 69 , 75–78 ] indicate that equilibrium 
for  (VII)  will  be  very  closely  approached  in  this  time  by  cae- 
sium, rubidium and potassium in a ﬂame at 2500 K, but not by 
sodium  or  lithium.  Weak  aqueous  solutions  (2 × 10 –4  molar)  of 
the  chlorides  of  Cs  (atomic  mass  133),  Rb  (masses  85 + 87)  and 
K (masses 39 + 41) were atomised [74] in turn into a pre-mixed 
2 = 2.98/1.00/1.97, 
ﬂame (unburnt composition by volume: H 
adiabatic temperature = 2636 K, measured temperature = 2570 K). 
Fig. 8 shows plots of the currents measured along the ﬂame’s axis 
for Cs + , Rb + and K + [74] . Hydrates A + .H 
2 O were found to be neg- 
ligible in this hot ﬂame; they are discussed below. The principal 
difference between these ion proﬁles in Fig. 8 is that Cs +  is the 
fastest to reach a steady level and K +  the slowest. This is in ac- 
cord with the activation energy of reaction (VII), being the ioni- 
sation  energy  of  an  atom  of  the  metal  concerned  [ 54 , 69 , 75–78 ]. 
The slightly higher, steady ion current for K + was explained by the 
presence of background impurities, as indicated by nebulising dis- 
tilled  water  [74]  into  the  ﬂame.  Thus,  Fig.  8  shows  that  the  in- 
strument’s sensitivity did not change, when varying the ionic mass 
by a factor of 3.3. This satisfactory state of affairs was considered 
[79] to be somewhat fortuitous. Of course, it could be that ions, 
lighter or heavier than the range covered by Fig. 8 , are less well 
behaved.

The instrument’s linearity with respect to ion concentration is 
conﬁrmed in Fig. 9 [79] . This is a plot of a steady maximum iron 
current, as observed as in Fig. 8 , plotted logarithmically against the 
molarity of the solution being atomised into the ﬂame’s supplies.

for the sampling oriﬁce. The points in Fig. 9 for all three metals 
lie nicely on the same straight line, which has a slope of unity. 
This conﬁrms that for all three ions, the ion current detected is 
directly proportional to the ion’s concentration in the ﬂame. In ad- 
dition, the instrument’s sensitivity is impressive. Thus, Fig. 9 in- 
dicates that nebulising a 10 –5 molar solution of KCl produced K + 
ions, which after calibrating the atomiser (see below) turned out 
to  have  a  mole  fraction  of  10 –10  in  the  ﬂame.  The  apparatus  in 
Fig. 4 was easily capable of detecting ion currents of ∼ 10 –14 A, but 
that could have been improved using e.g . an ion multiplier. With- 
out  such  improvements,  the  instrument  was  able  to  detect  ions 
in an atmospheric pressure ﬂame with a mole fraction as low as 
10 –13 . Thus, the instrument is unusually sensitive. 

In  the  1970s,  four  new  mass  spectrometers  for  studying  ions 
in ﬂames were built. First, Jensen and Miller [80] , working in Cal- 
cote’s laboratory, constructed what was then becoming a standard 
instrument. It is illustrated in Fig. 10 . Their aim was to burn well- 
designed, laminar, one-dimensional ﬂames at atmospheric pressure 
and then to investigate the ionisation of additives. The instrument 
in Fig. 10 will be noticed to have many more ion lenses and elec- 
trodes (than seen in Fig. 5 ) for focussing the ion beam into the 
quadrupole spectrometer. In addition, the ﬂame burned horizon- 
tally; also, the quadrupole mass ﬁlter used an ion multiplier, in- 
stead of a Faraday cup, as in Fig. 4 . These two workers realised 
that sampling ions into a mass spectrometer did introduce falsi- 
ﬁcations;  they  also  wrote  very  useful  reviews  of  ions  in  ﬂames 
[ 81 , 82 ]. 

Next, Goodings’s investigations of ions in ﬂames started around 
1971  [ 83 , 84 ].  Later  he  favoured  sampling  a  ﬂame  through  a  cir- 
cular hole in a lens (from an electron microscope) positioned in 
the tip of a stainless steel cone, cooled with water. It is described 
below. The result was a sampling cone with a blunt tip ≈ 2 mm 
wide, i.e . comparable to the original width of the sample, when 
in the ﬂame. Much later, Goodings built a new mass spectrome- 
ter for investigating ions in ﬂames [85] ; it is illustrated in Fig. 11 . 
One new feature was that it became easy to change the size of 

Fig. 10.  Jensen and Miller’s radio-frequency quadrupole mass ﬁlter [80] for exam- 
ining ions in a ﬂame at atmospheric pressure 

the inlet oriﬁce by using a different sampling plate, with a new 
sampling cone and different oriﬁce (illustrated below in Fig. 12 ), 
without losing the vacuum inside the mass spectrometer. Other- 
wise, the new instrument was similar to that illustrated in Figs. 4–
6 . Also, Fig. 11 shows various devices for directing the ion beam 
into the quadrupole mass ﬁlter, as well as extracting the ions of 
selected mass from its rear. The Faraday cup collects the selected 
ions on a plate, rather than in a cup, as in Fig. 4 . Goodings has 
written, inter alia , extremely useful reviews of both the chemistry 
of metallic ions in ﬂames [69] and of diagnostic studies of ﬂames 
by mass spectrometry [ 86 , 87 ]. 

Fig.  12  shows  the  sampling  system  of  Fig.  11  in  some  detail. 
The sample ﬂowed against a ﬂat, circular, surface of diameter ≈
2 mm at the blunt tip of the sampling nozzle. The important fea- 
ture was that the sample from a ﬂame entered a perfectly circu- 
lar hole (length ∼ 0.6 mm, diam. typically 0.17 mm, but could be 
varied from 0.1 to 0.2 mm) at the centre of a Pt/Ir disc, set well 
in front of a ﬂat, water-cooled mounting plate, just as in Fig. 4 . A 
comparison of the sampling system in Figs. 11 and 12 with that in 
Figs. 5 and 6 , shows that a sample was cooled differently by losing 
heat to the metal around the sampling oriﬁce, as well as there be- 
ing a sharp entry to a wide supersonic expansion. The Mach num- 
ber of the ﬂow was, of course, unity at the entrance to the oriﬁce 
in both cases. The set-up in Fig. 12 ensures that a ﬂame sample, 
initially of width ∼ 2 mm, contacts the metallic nozzle (width 2 
mm) slightly less than in Fig. 6 . However, in Fig. 12 the sample 
then moves down a circular channel for 0.6 mm, compared with a 
distance of almost zero in Fig. 6 . On leaving this channel, the gas in 
a sample suddenly expands into a conical duct, whose internal di- 
ameter is initially ∼ 1 mm, so that a ﬂowing sample experiences a 
sudden increase in cross-sectional area by a factor of ∼ 100. There-

solving power. Ions were still sampled from a low pressure ﬂame, 
burning at ≈ 0.04 atm. and sampled through a hole (diam. 0.30 
mm) drilled in platinum foil (thickness 0.05 mm), set at the apex 
of a stainless steel cone with thin walls (thickness 0.06 mm). The 
ions passed through a skimmer (oriﬁce diam. 0.8 mm) and later 
were focussed into the magnetic analyser. Ions with masses of 15–
300 a.m.u. were detected, but arrangements were made to subse- 
quently investigate ions with masses 30 0–7,0 0 0 a.m.u. [92] in soot- 
ing ﬂames. Some of these large ions had aromatic structures and 
considerable stability [93] . 

Finally, Homann, who had considerable experience of the mass 
spectrometry of neutral species in ﬂames [18–22] , seemed to adapt 
such an instrument to investigate charged species in low-pressure 
ﬂames, particularly fuel-rich or sooting ones. Some of these ions 
had  large  masses,  aromatic  structures  and  considerable  stability. 
Initially  [94] ,  ions  of  different  masses  were  separated  by  apply- 
ing a repelling voltage to the ions (of a selected sign) entering the 
ﬁrst  vacuum  chamber,  after  passing  through  the  inlet.  Although 
the sampling probe was made of quartz, it was considered nec- 
essary [94] to deﬁne the electrical potential of its inside surface 
by wrapping an earthed metallic wire around that surface. Other- 
wise, the sampling system of the mass spectrometer was conven- 
tional, except that arrangements had to be made to prevent soot 
blocking the inlet hole. This oriﬁce was either at the tip of a hol- 
low, quartz cone or a hole (diam. 0.30 mm) drilled in thin (0.05 
mm thick) platinum foil held at the apex of a stainless steel cone. 
The magnetic analyser did have novel features, mentioned above, 
for studying neutrals. Later, a time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer was 
introduced [ 22 , 95 , 96 ]; also deﬂection techniques were introduced 
for  collecting  and  even  observing  (with  an  electron  microscope) 
charged and uncharged particles of soot [97] , a technique also used 
by Roth and Hospital [98] and others [99] . 

One  notable  application  [100]  of  the  sampling  system  and 
equipment  shown  in  Fig.  5  has  been  in  the  ICP-MS  (inductively 
coupled plasma for mass spectrometry), an instrument widely used 
by e.g . geologists for analysing rocks and minerals. Basically, a rock 
is dissolved in an acid and subsequently atomised into a stream 
of argon, fed to a plasma, which is suﬃciently hot to ionise the 
added metals. The hot gases are then sampled, just as in Fig. 5 , 
into a mass spectrometer for analysis of the metallic ions. The de- 
velopment of this instrument from studies of metallic additives to 
ﬂames  [ 54 , 55 , 69 ]  has  been  described  [ 100 , 101 ],  as  also  have  its 
hugely important applications [102] to geological work, in both the 
ﬁeld and laboratory.

swaged into a water-cooled, stainless steel plate. 

after, the gas expanded down a duct of internal angle ∼ 60 o . Given 
that ion hydrates will be shown below to be largely “fake ions”, 
formed adventitiously during sampling, it is suﬃcient to compare 
the measured ratio: I H3O + .H2O / I H3O + , for the two sampling systems. 
According to Karrelas and Goodings [88] , the ratio “with the sam- 
pling plate shown in Fig. 12 is not as low as that measured with 
the conical chromium or nickel nozzles”, shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . 
However, one advantage of the Pt/Ir nozzles is that they are not 
eroded in very oxygen-rich ﬂames, as seems to be the case with 
nickel and chromium ones. Also, the Pt/Ir around the sampling ori- 
ﬁce has apparently not produced any new species, charged or un- 
charged. 

The third group, at Orleans, appears to have published its ﬁrst 
paper in around 1973 [ 46 , 89 ] using initially an instrument built by 
Thomas [90] . However, that instrument was quickly improved [91] , 
mainly by developing a new magnetic mass spectrometer, which 
deﬂected the ion beam through 360 °. The result was a higher re- 

12

Mention should be made of the mass spectrometer constructed 
by the Fialkov family [ 62 , 103 , 104 ] to study ﬂames at low pressures. 
Its design was based on its predecessors, mentioned above. Also in 
this tradition are the instruments of Nicholson and Swingler [105] , 
of Lillie et al. [106] for observing ions in diffusion ﬂames and also 
of Ospanov [107] . The last-mentioned study is interesting for not- 
ing that systems using molecular-beam sampling can result in a 
loss of sensitivity when detecting negative ions. This was referred 
to above and attributed there to events occurring in ion-sheaths at 
the inlet oriﬁce [60–61] . 

Newer  spectrometers,  devoted  to  analysing  ions  in  ﬂames  at 
1  atm,  include  one  by  Rodriguez  et  al.  [108] .  This  instrument 
had three vacuum chambers, unlike some of its predecessors with 
just two. Sampling was via an oriﬁce (diam. 0.1 mm) at the tip 
of  a  nickel  cone  with  an  expansion  angle  of  60 o .  Thus,  the  in- 
strument appears conventional. Finally, relatively recently, Alquaity 
et al. [ 109 , 110 ] are the latest to build a new instrument for another 
mass spectrometric analysis of the positive ions in a ﬂame of CH 
4 
and O 
2 , diluted with Ar and burning at atmospheric pressure. The 
ﬂame was sampled through a hole (diam. 0.1 mm) at the tip of “a 
5-mm-long alumina cone of 90 o angle”, i.e . the sampling cone was 
non-metallic.  Otherwise,  this  instrument  also  had  three  vacuum 
chambers. The beam of ions was focussed into a quadrupole mass 
ﬁlter, apparently without signiﬁcant, lateral, x–y shift of the ions. 
Such shifts, orthogonal to the direction of the beam, were consid- 
ered essential in some instruments [ 50 , 85 ]. It is interesting to note 
that the authors [109] thought that ions left a beam, even when 
focussed by more than one ion lens, to the same extent as neutral 
species leaving a molecular beam. However, with a non-metallic 
sampling cone made of alumina, the electric ﬁelds, encountered by 
the ions entering the ﬁrst chamber, might not be as well-deﬁned 
as with a frequently cleaned, metallic sampling cone. 

2 + O 

One recent development is worth noting [111] . It uses an ion 
funnel  and  ion  guides,  when  sampling  a  low  pressure  ﬂame  of 
2 + Ar with iron pentacarbonyl added to the mixture of un- 
H 
burnt gases. These ion funnels and ion guides markedly improve 
the eﬃciency, with which ions leaving the supersonic expansion 
subsequently enter the mass spectrometer [ 112 , 113 ]. In this case, 
the many ions containing Fe were investigated, to extend previ- 
ous studies by Goodings et al. [114] , as well as Ham and McAl- 
lister [115] . As noted above, the mass spectrometer in Fig. 4 was 
very sensitive, but there is a good case [116] for boosting the sen- 
sitivity  of  the  mass  spectrometer  used  in  ICP-MS,  as  discussed 
above. 

In  conclusion,  given  that  they  have  been  made  for  just  over 
50  years,  it  is  surprising  how  similar  are  many  of  these  instru- 
ments for sampling ions from a ﬂame and then subjecting them 
for analysis in a mass spectrometer. Equally notable is the fact that 
only  two  groups  of  workers  [ 60 , 63–65 , 86 , 117–119 ]  have  actually 
applied  voltages  between  their  burner  and  sampling  cone.  Such 
a procedure proved very informative for positive ions, but much 
more  so  for  negative  ions,  as  discussed  below.  Another,  equally 
neglected, aspect is the topic of this review, which addresses the 
question of what can be learned by repeating observations of the 
ions in a particular ﬂame, but using sampling oriﬁces with differ- 
ing diameters. This is a fairly easy way of varying both the con- 
ditions for sampling, as well as the falsiﬁcations of a mass spec- 
trum, introduced when a sample is cooled by as many as three 
distinct  ways.  For  two  of  these  ways  of  cooling–in  the  external 
boundary  layer  and  in  the  supersonic  expansion–it  will  be  seen 
below  that  the  associated  fall  in  temperature  can  be  varied  by 
altering  the  diameter  of  the  inlet  oriﬁce.  All  of  this  means  that 
the size of the inlet oriﬁce is an important variable for these ob- 
servations.  Here  mention  should  be  made  of  several  reviews  of 
the  problems  encountered  when  sampling  a  ﬂame  into  a  mass 
spectrometer [ 18 , 23 , 24 , 53 , 62 , 86 , 120 , 121 ]. 

2.3. Burners 

By  far  the  simplest  burner  for  a  ﬂame  at  atmospheric  pres- 
sure  is  a  straightforward  tube  (typically  o.d.  ∼ 6  mm;  i.d.  ∼ 2 
mm;  length  50–100  mm)  of  pyrex  glass  or  quartz  or  e.g .  stain- 
less steel, mounted on a moveable carriage, so that different points 
along  a  ﬂame’s  axis  can  be  sampled.  The  tube’s  dimensions  are 
not  critical.  Such  a  simple,  pre-mixed  ﬂame  is  most  appropriate 
for measuring ionic concentrations just before, or in, or immedi- 
ately downstream of the ﬂame’s visible reaction zone [68] . Usually 
such a tube is long enough for Poiseuille ﬂow to develop in the 
unburned gases, so the velocity of the gas before entering the re- 
action zone on the axis of symmetry is twice the mean velocity 
[122] . Such a horizontal Bunsen burner contrasts with the wider 
Méker burner  shown in  Figs. 5 , 6  and 7 ,  where the core  of the 
burned gas is much better deﬁned in terms of its velocity and tem- 
perature [ 79 , 123 , 124 ]. Fig. 6 makes it clear that only a narrow re- 
gion, close to a ﬂame’s axis, is sampled. This ensures that entrain- 
ment of laboratory air into a ﬂame does not affect observations 
until sampling is well downstream of the reaction zone. Experience 
has shown that air-entrainment, or after-burning of fuel around a 
fuel-rich ﬂame [125] , becomes noticeable at distances somewhat 
greater than approximately two ﬂame–diameters from the reaction 
zone [ 4 , 5 ] of a Méker burner. Of course, ﬂames can be burned hor- 
izontally or vertically on a moveable burner. Horizontal ﬂames in- 
evitably taper upwards at their tip; the extent of this depends on 
the temperature, velocity and density of the ﬂame. 

A third type of burner for a premixed ﬂame at 1 bar is illus- 
trated in Fig. 13 . In essence, it incorporates a water-cooled, brass 
plate, drilled with a close-packed array of holes (i.d. ∼ 0.7 mm). 
A conical reaction zone (extending 1–2 mm from the face of the 
burner) sits on each hole and again the burned gases merge into a 
cylindrical column, where the axial velocity is 2–10 m/s, depending 
on the ﬁnal steady temperature along the axis. Because the holes 
in the burner’s face are much shorter ( ∼ 4 mm) than the hypoder- 
mic tubes in Figs. 5 and 6 , Poiseuille ﬂow hardly develops inside 
them. The result is that any radial variations in the burnt gas’s ax- 
ial velocity are much smaller for the burner shown in Fig. 13 than 

Fig. 13.  Burner (made of brass) for burning laminar, premixed ﬂames at atmo- 
spheric pressure. The entry for the unburned gas mixture is held on with 2 springs 
and sealed with an “O” ring.

in Fig. 5 . Such a burner has proved useful for studying the pro- 
duction  of  inorganic  nanoparticles  [ 126 , 127 ]  in  ﬂames.  Fuel-rich 
ﬂames are notable for having long central areas, where the tem- 
perature in the burned gas does not change for at least 25 mm 
[ 67 , 79 ]. 

For the burners, shown in Figs. 5 and 7 , the temperature along 
a  ﬂame’s  axis  was  measured  by  two  techniques:  the  Na-D  line 
method  [ 74 , 128–131 ]  and  using  coated  thermocouples  [ 74 , 128 ]. 
The  Na-D  line  technique  required  the  ﬂame  to  be  burned  on  a 
copy of the burner, but with the ﬂame surrounded by an identi- 
cal ﬂame without metallic additives. Such a procedure avoided en- 
training the surrounding atmosphere into the central ﬂame. When 
sampling ions close to a ﬂame’s axis, less than two ﬂame diameters 
downstream of the reaction zone, the sample was never perturbed 
by entraining the ambient atmosphere. The axial temperature, e.g . 
on the burner in Fig. 13 , usually rose to a steady value after ∼ 8 
mm from the reaction zone, depending on the velocity and com- 
position of the burned gas. 

3. Observations of positive ions in ﬂames 

3.1.1. Scattering of ions in the ﬁrst vacuum chamber 

Early on [79] with the apparatus in Fig. 4 , it was observed that 
the pressure in the ﬁrst vacuum chamber of a mass spectrome- 
ter varied slightly from ﬂame to ﬂame and also with the diameter 
of the sampling oriﬁce for the same ﬂame. Of course, the rate of 
sampling is independent of the pressure in the ﬁrst chamber, be- 
cause the ﬂow is choked, as discussed below. In that study [79] it 
proved possible to increase the pressure in the ﬁrst chamber by 
partially  closing  the  baﬄe-valve,  located  on  top  of  the  diffusion 
pump evacuating the ﬁrst vacuum chamber. Then it proved pos- 
sible to measure the reduced ion signals. Fig. 14 shows plots of the 
logarithm of some detected ion currents against the background 
pressure in the ﬁrst vacuum chamber. The linearity of these plots 

indicates that a measured ion current, I , varies with the pressure, 
P , in the ﬁrst chamber according to: 
I = I 0 exp (−βP ) . 

3 O + .H 

Here  I 0  is  the  current  measured  in  the  limiting  case  of  zero 
pressure in the ﬁrst chamber and is the best measure of an ion’s 
concentration. The parameter, β, is given by the slope of a plot in 
Fig. 14 . It is an effective scattering coeﬃcient for what is a con- 
stant  path  length  for  scattering.  Fig.  14  indicates  that,  for  these 
positive ions, the loss in ion current from I 0 is ∼ 10 %, given that 
the normal working pressure is the lowest shown. This loss was 
found  [79]  not  to  vary  signiﬁcantly  from  ﬂame  to  ﬂame.  How- 
ever, it is conspicuous in Fig. 14 that the loss of a large ion, such 
as H 
2 O, is greater than for a small atomic ion of an alkali 
metal. Further examination has revealed [57] that ions are mainly 
scattered early in the supersonic expansion (where the pressure is 
highest) by neutral molecules from the ﬂame under observation. In 
addition, there is the less important scattering by neutrals from the 
background in the ﬁrst vacuum chamber. These studies [57] also 
provided evidence that the transition from continuum to molecu- 
lar ﬂow in an expansion occurs at a distance downstream of the 
inlet of ≈ 8 oriﬁce diameters. Of course, Fig. 14 provides a way 
of  estimating and  correcting  for  the  loss  of  any  ions by  scatter- 
ing, whenever care is necessary to achieve highest accuracy. Quite 
often the distortion of a mass spectrum by scattering is not a ma- 
jor effect. Nobody appears to have investigated scattering for sam- 
pling neutrals in a low pressure ﬂame, but it can be expected to 
be less than the 10% reported above [ 57 , 79 ], mainly because of the 
reduced pressure in the ﬂame, but also on account of ions having 
larger cross-sections, β. 

3.1.2. The ﬁrst hydrate of H 3 O + in ﬂames of H 2 + O 2 

3 O + .H 

2 ,  Ar  or  CO 

The ions, H 
2  and  O 

2  have  all  fulﬁlled  that  rôle,  although  CO 

3 O + and H 
2 O, will now be examined in ﬂames 
of  H 
2 .  The  compositions  of  the  unburnt  gas  supplied  to 
some such, fuel-rich ﬂames are shown in Table 1 . To adjust the 
temperature of the burned gas, different amounts of various dilu- 
ents were added to the gas mixture supplied to the burner. Thus, 
N 
2  is  likely 
to be a reactive diluent, except in a ﬂame suﬃciently oxygen-rich 
to  inhibit  the  appearance  of  CO.  In  Table  1  the  diluent  was  N 
2 
or Ar. Historically, the ions in fuel-rich ﬂames were studied ﬁrst 
[ 1 , 4 , 37 , 43 , 132 , 133 ], when individual concentration proﬁles of each 
3 O +  and  its  hydrates,  were  measured  along  a 
positive  ion,  e.g .  H 
ﬂame’s  axis.  Early  on,  it  was  concluded  [ 2 , 37 , 134 ]  that  the  hy- 
3 O + was mainly a sampling artefact, i.e. H 
drate of H 
2 O was 
3 O + , whilst a sample was cooled 
formed from the genuine ion H 
during  sampling.  Consequently,  in  a  later  study  of  oxygen-rich 
ﬂames [135] it was decided to measure the total concentration of 
all the positive ions along a ﬂame, as well as the ratio [H 
2 O] 
3 O + ], i.e . the ratio of the measured amounts of the suspected 
/ [H 
spurious ion and its genuine parent.

The  temperature  along  the  axis  of  the  burned  gas  of  one 
of  these  ﬂames  of  H 
2 ,  whether  fuel-lean  or  rich,  rises 
[135] rapidly in the reaction zone and subsequently fairly slowly to 
a constant value at ∼ 8 mm downstream of the reaction zone. The 
isothermal region lasts longer in fuel-rich ﬂames than in fuel-lean 
ones.  Because  of  chain-branching  in  their  reaction  zones,  these 
ﬂames have the striking feature that the free radicals H, OH and 
O  are  produced  there  in  amounts  far  exceeding  those  for  ther- 
modynamic equilibrium [ 70 , 71 , 130 , 136 ], which is almost attained 
far downstream in a ﬂame. Very quickly in the burned gas, these 
radicals form a pool, because their concentrations are coupled by 
rapid, equilibrated reactions like (III) [ 70 , 71 , 130 , 136 ]. However, rad- 
icals do leave the pool to attain their much lower concentrations 
for equilibrium, by recombining in the relatively slow, termolecular 
reactions: [ 70 , 71 , 130 , 136 ]:

Here M represents a molecule acting to remove energy from the 
two recombining radicals. The enthalpy released in these slow, but 
exothermic, reactions causes the temperature in the burned gas ( T 
f 
in Table 1 ) to rise to a steady value from ∼ 8 to 25 mm down- 
stream of the reaction zone The value of T 
f is shown in Table 1 for 
that measured at 20 mm. This value exceeds that measured at 3 
mm downstream and given in Table 1 . However, the temperature 
at 20 mm is less than the ﬂame’s adiabatic temperature, T 
ad , also 
shown in Table 1 . This difference reﬂects the loss of enthalpy from 
a  ﬂame  to  its  surroundings,  including  the  burner.  The  ﬁnal  ax- 
ial velocity along the burned gas of these ﬂames varied from 21 
m/s in the hottest ﬂame to 11 m/s in the coolest. The ﬂames in 
2  or Ar, but 
Table 1 are organised in pairs, diluted with either N 
2 in the un- 
2 / O 
having the same ﬁnal temperatures and ratio of H 
burned gas. 

Chromium  sampling  nozzles  were  used  in  this  ﬁrst  study 
[137] to be described. When sampling the hottest ﬂame (at 2400 
K) in Table 1 , the tip of one of these sampling cones glowed red, 
suggesting a temperature of ≈ 1350 K at the very tip. Interestingly, 
the nozzle was hotter when sampling a ﬂame close to its reaction 
zone, as opposed to well downstream. This probably was caused 
by the ﬂame’s free radicals, present in amounts exceeding those 
for thermodynamic equilibrium (and more so nearer the reaction 
zone), recombining on the nozzle’s metallic surface. Natural ioni- 
sation in the ﬂames of Table 1 was low, so to produce easily mea- 
3 O +  and its ﬁrst hydrate, ≈ 0.4 vol. % 
sured quantities of both H 
of C 
2 was added to the mixture of gases supplied to the burner. 
This caused ions to be generated in the reaction zone of each ﬂame 
by chemi-ionisation [ 1 , 2 , 137 ] in: 

2 H 

CH + O → CHO + + e −, 

(X) 

as  proposed  by  Calcote  [138]  and  conﬁrmed  experimentally  by 
Sugden et al. [ 1 , 2 ] and others [139] . Very rapidly after reaction (X), 
3 O + ions by a proton be- 
as noted above, reaction (II) then forms H 
ing transferred from CHO +  to a molecule of H 
2 O. Adding such a 
small amount of C 
2 is known [ 1 , 2 , 129 ] 
not to affect the properties of the ﬂame, particularly its tempera- 
ture. It should be mentioned that the relatively small amounts of 
3 O + formed without a hydrocarbon additive in a ﬂame of H 
H 
2 and 
2 are caused [ 133 , 135 ] by the overall reaction:

i.e . the reverse of reaction (I). 

(– I) 

Measurements along the ﬂames of H 

2  in Table 1 showed 
that  the  ratio  ( I H3O + /I H3O + .H2O )  was  constant  beyond  ∼ 2  mm 
downstream  of  the  reaction  zone.  Fig.  15  shows  this  ratio 

2 + O 

( I H3O + /I H3O + .H2O )  rising  sharply  in  the  reaction  zone  of  a  ﬂame, 
similar to those in Table 1 . After that point, the ratio of ion cur- 
rents becomes remarkably steady, indicating that the ﬂame is wide 
enough not to be seriously affected by entrainment of atmospheric 
air or by after-burning of excess H 
2 in the surrounding laboratory 
air. In addition, it looks as if there is a steady state relationship 
3 O + and its ﬁrst hydrate. The constant ratio of the spu- 
between H 
rious and genuine ions, i.e . ( I H3O + .H2O /I H3O + ), as measured at 3 mm 
downstream of the reaction zone of four ﬂames from Table 1 , is 
plotted against the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce in Fig. 16 . In 
the coolest ﬂame, 3A, with a measured local temperature of 1841 
K  at  3  mm,  the  ratio  was  as  high  as  ∼ 6,  when  a  small  sam- 
pling oriﬁce (diam. 0.034 mm) was used. For all the three ﬂames 
in Fig. 16 diluted with argon, this ratio is seen to fall to a mini- 
mum, when progressively larger inlet holes were used. Thus, the 
ratio eventually increases, when the diameter of the inlet oriﬁce 
exceeds ≈ 0.1 mm. The conclusion from observing a minimum in 
Fig. 16 for the ﬂames diluted with argon must be that there are at 
least two distinct and opposing effects causing the ratio to exceed 
some minimum value and to vary with the inlet hole’s diameter. 
Thus, one effect apparently becomes more important, if progres- 
sively smaller oriﬁces are used; the other effect becomes increas- 
ingly conspicuous when gradually larger inlet holes are employed. 

3.1.3. Boundary layer cooling 

Of  course,  with  the  smallest  sampling  holes,  the  hydrate  of 
3 O +  is  most  probably  formed  by  a  sample  from  a  ﬂame  be- 
H 
ing cooled by contacting the cooler sampling nozzle [1] , shown in 
Fig. 6 . Thus a sample from a ﬂame might have been originally at 
e.g . 2400 K, but with the tip of the nozzle, seen (by its colour) to 
be at ∼ 1350 K, there results heat transfer from the sample to the 
cooled nozzle. Consequently, there resulted heat transfer from the 
sample to the cooled nozzle. Also, the tip of a sampling nozzle can 
be thought of as being covered by a thermal boundary layer, across 
which the temperature changes from that of the unsampled ﬂame 
to that of the nozzle. With progressively larger oriﬁces, more of 
the boundary layer is sucked into the subsequent expansion and 
the ﬁrst vacuum chamber. This is because the suction’s strength is 
proportional to the area of the inlet hole. The result is that a sam- 
ple is cooled less in the thermal boundary layer, when passing into 
a larger oriﬁce, where the inﬂuence of a central undisturbed core 
becomes more apparent. This effect can be seen in Fig. 16 by the 
plot for ﬂame 3, which was diluted with N 
2 , instead of Ar. Here, as 
discussed below, only the effect of boundary layer cooling was evi- 
dent, in that no minimum or subsequent rise was observed. In fact, 
the ratio ( I H3O + .H2O /I H3O + ) steadily declined on increasing the diam- 
eter of the oriﬁce. In addition, it is clear in Fig. 16 that with ﬂame 
3 a sample cools less in the boundary layer around the smallest 
oriﬁce than is the case with ﬂame 3A. It also is likely that with 
the largest sampling hole, any cooling of a sample from ﬂame 3, 
by transferring heat to the tip of the nozzle, is almost negligible.

Fig. 15.  The ratio I H3O + /I H3O + .H2O , as measured along a premixed ﬂame with unburnt composition H 2 /O 2 /N 2 = 3.0/1.0/3.0, burning at 1 atm. on the burner shown in Fig. 13 . 
The steady temperature measured in the burned gas was 2330 K; the sampling oriﬁce had a diameter of 165 μm [140] . 

approximate theory [124] predicts likely values for the cooling of 
a  sample;  it  also  clearly  shows  [124]  that  a  sample  cools  more 
in the boundary layers around smaller oriﬁces. This is illustrated 
in Fig. 17 , which depicts the sample and ﬂow-ﬁelds for large and 
small  sampling  oriﬁces.  Clear  photographs  of  the  streamlines  in 
these ﬂow-ﬁelds have been published by Goodings et al. [85] , for 
different separations of the burner and the sampling nozzle. Such 
visualisations  were  made  possible  by  seeding  a  fuel-lean  ﬂame 
with  a  salt  of  cerium,  which  formed  tiny  luminous  particles  of 
cerium oxide. With the wider hole in Fig. 17 , only the central 1–
2 mm nearest the ﬂame’s axis were sampled. Also, with a larger 
oriﬁce, less of the sample passed through the boundary layer, so 
that hardly any of it was cooled in the boundary layer. However, 
with a small inlet hole, most of the sample was cooled on pass- 
ing through the now thicker thermal boundary layer. The slopes 
of the plots for ﬂames 1A–3A in Fig. 16 suggest that the small- 
est oriﬁce (diam. 0.034 mm) was totally covered by the thermal 
boundary layer. In that case, the boundary layer would have had a 
thickness of at least 0.034 / 2 = 0.017 mm. Assuming the mean ve- 
locity for the sample had doubled from its upstream value to ≈ 25 
m/s when close to the inlet, its mean residence time in the bound- 
ary layer was ≈ 0.017 × 10 –3 / 25 ≈ 0.7 μs. Of course, with a larger 
inlet hole, this mean residence time would have been less. Other 
estimates [124] , discussed below, indicate that the mean residence 
time of a sample in a thermal boundary layer is of the order of 0.5 
μs. In fact, the experimental indications are [59] that, in order for 
a chemical equilibrium, such as: 

H 3 O + + H 2 O = H 3 O + . H 2 O, 

(XI) 

to  shift  to  its  right-hand  side  and  so  adjust  to  the  falling  tem- 
peratures encountered when a sample passes through an external 
boundary  layer,  it  must  be  exothermic,  with  an  appreciable  en- 
thalpy  of  reaction  and  also  have  a  time  constant  (in  the  ﬂame) 
below ∼ 0.5 μs, i.e . the approximate residence time of a sample 
in the thermal boundary layer. In this case, such a fast reaction 
would have been quickly equilibrated early in the ﬂame. This de- 
rives from the velocity of the burned gas being ≈ 10 - 25 m/s, so 
that a movement along the ﬂame’s axis of 1 mm corresponds to 
a residence time of 40 to 100 μs. In addition, there is a hint from 
Fig. 16 that, although reaction (XI) is fast enough to occur in a ther- 
mal boundary layer, it is too slow to occur much when sampling 

Fig. 16.  Plots of I H3O + .H2O /I H3O + , measured at 3 mm downstream of the reaction zone 
of four ﬂames from Table 1 [53] . The measurements are plotted against the diam- 
eter of the sampling oriﬁce used. The sampling nozzles were electroformed from 
chromium and were illustrated in Fig. 6 . The ratios for ﬂame 1A have been scaled 
up for clarity. 

As to why there is more boundary layer cooling of a ﬂame di- 
luted with Ar than with N 
2 , will be discussed later in section 3.2.3 , 
after an approximate theoretical analysis of cooling in the bound- 
ary layer has been formulated [124] . The model assumed that the 
motion  of  the  sample  was  governed  by  potential  ﬂow  of  an  in- 
viscid  ﬂuid  [123]  from  the  ﬂame  into  a  sink  at  the  oriﬁce.  This

3.1.4. Supersonic expansion of a sample into a vacuum 
chamber–choked ﬂow 

As regards a sample, e.g . from a ﬂame diluted with Ar, being 
cooled, when a large sampling hole is used, this has been shown 
[133] to occur mainly during the rapid, supersonic and almost adi- 
abatic expansion of  gases inside the expansion duct  of  the con- 
ical  sampling  nozzle,  shown  in  Fig.  17 .  In  that  case,  it  is  likely 
that  in  ∼ 0.1  μs  the  temperature  plummets  by  more  than  10 0 0 
K [ 133 , 134 ], so that, if the exothermic equilibrium (XI) were fast 
enough to adjust to these rapid changes, considerable amounts of 
3 O + .H 
2 O would be formed. The ﬁrst aspect to note is that, even 
H 
if the sample loses heat to the sampling nozzle, the Mach num- 
ber at the narrowest part of the oriﬁce is always constrained to be 
locally unity [ 79 , 122 , 141 , 142 ]. Such a situation of choked ﬂow oc- 
curs, when the ratio of the back pressure in the ﬁrst chamber to 
the pressure in the ﬂame is less than 
(cid:4)

(cid:5) γ

γ −1

1 +  γ

of 0.64 [ 79 , 143 ] and 0.86 [ 85 , 144 ]. In the latter case, the nozzle 
protruded  ∼ 2  mm  in  front  of  its  water-cooled  ﬂat,  supporting 
plate. That a discharge coeﬃcient can be close to unity indicates 
that the momentum boundary layer around the oriﬁce is inconse- 
quential, as if a momentum boundary layer takes longer to form 
than a thermal boundary layer. 

That there is choked ﬂow in the oriﬁce’s throat means that the 
velocity of the sample there equals the local speed of sound, i.e . 
( γ R T t / M w ) 1/2 . Here γ is the ratio of the principal speciﬁc heats, 
C p and C v , of the gaseous sample. R is the gas constant on a mo- 
lar basis, so R = 8.314 J K −1 mol −1 , T t is the absolute temperature 
of the sample in the throat of the oriﬁce and M w is the mean rel- 
ative molecular mass of the gas in the sample. Of course, a rich 
2 in its burned gas, resulting in 
ﬂame of H 
a relatively low M w and both a large sonic velocity and sampling 
rate.  Detailed,  two-dimensional  computations  [134]  have  shown 
the sample’s subsequent expansion inside the 60 ° conical nozzle 
can be treated [ 122 , 141 , 142 ] as a one-dimensional, adiabatic, isen- 
tropic expansion, for which:

i.e . 0.54 for γ = 1.35 [ 141 , 142 ]. That the Mach number is unity at 
the narrowest part of the inlet is also true [ 79 , 122 , 141 , 142 ], if the 
ﬂow were to experience friction, when passing through the oriﬁce. 
At this stage it must be stressed that, unlike the sampling ar- 
rangement  [ 1 , 2 ]  in  Fig.  2 ,  discussed  above,  the  one  in  Figs.  5 , 
6  and  17  has  the  tip  of  the  sampling  cone  poking  through  any 
boundary layer formed by burning a ﬂame against a cooled, ﬂat 
plate. This was established computationally [123] and experimen- 
tally [ 64 , 79 ] by measuring the oriﬁce’s discharge coeﬃcient [122] , 
i.e . that fraction of its theoretical maximum is the actual ﬂow rate 
of gas through the sampling oriﬁce. In fact, for a modern sampling 
nozzle  (with  its  tip  protruding  ∼ 6  mm  in  front  of  its  support- 
ing plate), the discharge coeﬃcient was found to be unity [64] , in- 
dicating no effects of this boundary layer covering the ﬂat plate. 
However, earlier sampling nozzles, which did not protrude as much 
from their mounting plate, did have smaller discharge coeﬃcients 

Here p denotes the pressure, ρ the density and T the absolute 
temperature in the sample at a point along the expanding, acceler- 
ating gas. The subscript f gives the value of a parameter for stagna- 
tion conditions, i.e . for when a sample has been brought adiabati- 
cally and isentropically to rest. To a good approximation, this can 
be assumed to be that in the unsampled ﬂame. The local tempera- 
ture at points along the expansion is solely governed [ 122 , 141 , 142 ] 
by the local Mach number, M, which along the expansion duct in- 
creases rapidly above unity according to: 

f /T = 1 +

Eq.  (4)  expresses  the  conservation  of  enthalpy  for  a  sample 
moving  adiabatically  from  a  ﬂame  into  supersonic  ﬂow  inside 
the  expansion  duct,  where  the  internal  energy  of  the  sample’s 
molecules is converted into kinetic energy. The assumption that a 
sample loses negligible heat to the nozzle is realised most closely, 

17 

A.N. Hayhurst 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 88 (2022) 100927 

when using a relatively large inlet oriﬁce, so the sample then min- 
imally contacts the metallic nozzle. 

In addition, ideal gas behaviour can be assumed for the sample; 
this, together with the mass ﬂow rate of the sample being constant 
throughout  the  expansion,  gives  the  mass  of  ﬂame  sampled  per 
second as equal to: 

ρAu = W = ρt A t ( γ R T t / M w ) 1 / 2 = ρ

f A t ( γ R T t / M w ) 1 / 2 { 2 / ( 1 + γ ) } 1 / (γ −1) . 
(5) 

Here A is the local, internal cross-sectional area of the expan- 
sion duct, and the subscript t denotes the value of a quantity at 
the oriﬁce’s throat. The fact that W is given by Eq. (5) depends 
on the discharge coeﬃcient for the sampling oriﬁce being unity. 
Eqs. (2) to (5) enable the complete ﬂow-ﬁeld inside the expansion 
to be estimated [59] , assuming the ﬂow is one-dimensional.. This 
can  be  done  by  ﬁrst  stipulating  M  and γ ,  so  that  all  the  other 
quantities  are  then  easily  calculated.  Having  speciﬁed  M  and γ , 
the local internal diameter, d , of the expansion duct, and its cross- 
sectional area, A , are given by:

Eq. (4) shows that, because T 

f is the temperature of the unsam- 
pled ﬂame, then on accelerating to a Mach number of unity in the

f ( γ − 1)/(1 + γ ). Thus, Table 1 shows that with γ = 1.349 
i.e. by T 
for ﬂame 2A at 2080 K, this “aerodynamic” cooling alone ( i.e . dis- 
regarding any loss of enthalpy by the sample to a sampling nozzle) 
would be 309 K. Such cooling is caused by the sample accelerat- 
ing to the speed of sound for conditions in the neck of the oriﬁce. 
The result is a substantial, unavoidable, drop in temperature for a 
sample from a ﬂame. The extent of this “aerodynamic cooling” de- 
f and γ . In fact, an increase in γ causes this third 
pends only on T 
mode of cooling to become larger. The acceleration to M = 1 also 
causes the pressure and density in the sample to fall (via Eq. (3) ), 
so that for ﬂame 2A, p t /p 

f = 0.54. 

Cooling  and  in  fact  the  entire  ﬂow  ﬁeld  in  the  adiabatic  ex- 
pansion inside the sampling nozzle are described by Eqs. (3) –(7) , 
which assume that such a one-dimensional treatment of adiabatic 
ﬂow is adequate. Some results are shown in Fig. 18 to compare 
ﬂames  3  and  3A,  when  sampled  through  an  oriﬁce  of  diame- 
ter 100 μm, for which Fig. 16 showed some measurements. First 
3A for these two 
Fig. 18 gives plots of the Mach numbers, M 
ﬂames.  They  increase  sharply  (above  unity)  with  distance  along 
the expansion, but with M 
3A  rising faster. The local temperature 
plunges extremely rapidly in the early part of the conical duct. Be- 
cause of Eq. (3) , the pressure also falls dramatically. Thus, the tem- 
perature of a sample from ﬂame 3A falls from that at the throat to 
as low as ∼ 150 K after expanding for 0.4 mm, i.e. by a distance 
equal to 4 oriﬁce diameters. For comparison, a sample from ﬂame 
3 diluted with nitrogen, rather than argon, is cooled to only ∼ 325 
K at this distance. 

3 and M 

One further difference is apparent in Fig. 18 between these two 
ﬂames, which have the same initial temperature (of 1980 K in the 
ﬂame) and ratio of [H 
2 ] in their unburned gas. This is that 
a sample from ﬂame 3A moves slower down the expansion duct 
than a sample from ﬂame 3. This is seen by comparing the resi- 
dence times, t 3 and t 3A , spent by a sample in reaching a particular

expansion of a sample from ﬂame 3 ( γ = 1.254, T t = 1661 K) or 3A ( γ = 1.399, 
T t = 1536 K) is one-dimensional. Plotted against distance downstream of a sampling 
oriﬁce of diameter 100 μm are: the Mach numbers M 3 and M 3A , the residence times

distance down the expansion. Thus, it is clear that at any distance 
t 3A  exceeds  t 3 .  Consequently,  a  ﬂame  diluted  with  argon  moves 
slower  in  the  expansion  duct,  but  is  cooled  more  than  one  di- 
luted with nitrogen. It will also be seen from these plots of t 3 and 
t 3A against axial distance that their slopes eventually become con- 
stant, i.e . the velocity of the sample settles down in both cases to 
a steady value, which is lower for a ﬂame diluted with argon than 
one diluted with N 
2 . Thus, the indications are that a greater per- 
turbation of an ion spectrum can be expected in a supersonic ex- 
pansion from a ﬂame diluted with argon than with nitrogen. This 
was borne out by the experiments shown in Fig. 16 . 

In  summary,  it  is  clear  that  a  sample  from  a  ﬂame  is  in- 
escapably accelerated to the local speed of sound at the narrow- 
est part of the entry to the expansion duct inside a sampling cone. 
The cooling associated with this increase in a sample’s velocity can 
easily be calculated and often turns out to be up to ≈ 400 K, when 
γ is large with Ar as the diluent. It is important to know the dura- 
tion of this third, “aerodynamic” way of cooling a sample; a rough 
estimate can be made as follows. Computations of the ﬂow ﬁeld 
in  a  ﬂame  just  before  a  sample  reaches  a  sampling  oriﬁce  will 
be described below. They [ 79 , 123 , 124 ] reveal that a sample’s ax- 
ial velocity falls to a slight minimum, caused by the ﬂame burn- 
ing against a ﬂat plate. Afterwards, the sample accelerates into the 
oriﬁce, with its velocity increasing from typically 10–25 m/s in the 
bulk of the ﬂame to the local speed of sound (800–950 m/s) at the 
entry to the expansion. The acceleration and associated cooling oc-

trations of a spurious ion, such as H 
2 O, and its parent, here 
3 O + . The lowest, broken horizontal line gives the constant ratio 
H 
of the two ions for unperturbed conditions at the point of sam- 
pling in the ﬂame. The falling curve A gives this ratio of the two 
ions after a sample has been cooled in only the thermal boundary 
layer, covering the high-pressure side of the sampling nozzle, but 
also by aerodynamic cooling, whilst accelerating to a Mach num- 
ber of unity in the throat of the inlet oriﬁce. In that case, the su- 
personic expansion does not alter the sample. The rising curve B 
is for an equilibrium fast enough to be perturbed by cooling in the 
supersonic expansion, as well as whilst accelerating to M = 1 in the 
throat. Curve A extrapolates for large inlet oriﬁces ( i.e . for d t → ∞ ) 
to give line C, for when the sample has been only perturbed by be- 
ing accelerated to M = 1. Likewise, the rising curve B can be extrap- 
olated to zero size for an inlet hole ( i.e . so d t → 0) to yield C , the 
horizontal line for aerodynamic cooling only. The broken curve D is 
for the general and possibly real case of all three mechanisms able 
to falsify an ion spectrum. In that situation, one should deal with 
the falling and rising portions of curve D separately. The measured 
ionic ratios for d t smaller than that for the minimum can be ex- 
trapolated to d t → ∞ or e.g . 1/ d 2 
t → 0. Similarly, the measured ionic 
ratios for d t larger than its value for the minimum can be extrap- 
olated back to yield a value for d t → 0. The experimental results in 
Fig. 16 suggest that the most fruitful procedure in that case would 
be to extrapolate the falling values of the ionic ratio, because there 
are more of them. The result is a value for the ionic ratio in the 
throat of the inlet without any cooling from a thermal boundary 
layer or the supersonic expansion. 

There  is  an  important  distinction  to  be  made  as  follows.  For 
a chemical equilibrium to shift in the external thermal boundary 
layer, its time constant should be less than ∼ 0.5 μs, for conditions 
in the undisturbed ﬂame. In that case, the chemical equilibrium 
will also shift during the sample’s acceleration to a Mach number 
of unity on entering the inlet hole. However, at this stage for an 
equilibrium to shift in the supersonic expansion, it looks as if the 
reaction has to be even faster. Of course, its time constant, τ , must 
be less than some critical value for conditions in the sample at the 
throat of oriﬁce, i.e . at the start of the isentropic expansion. This 
will be discussed in detail, below in Section 3.1.7 . 

3.1.6. Thermodynamics of mono-hydration of H 3 O + 

Fig. 19 indicated that the measurements in Fig. 16 ( e.g . for ﬂame 
3A sampled with small oriﬁces) might be extrapolated to yield the 
ionic ratio for a sampling oriﬁce, inﬁnite in diameter, and conse- 
quently perturbed only by aerodynamic cooling. Along such a fuel- 
rich  ﬂame,  steady  values  of  ( I H3O + .H2O  /I H3O + )  [ 140 , 145 ]  were  at- 
tained in the burned gas; an example was shown in Fig. 15 , where 
at 5 mm from the burner ( ∼ 3 - 4 mm downstream of the re- 
action  zone)  the  ratio  became  constant.  These  steady  values  are 
plotted in Fig. 20 against d t , the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce 
used. Clearly, from the shape of the plot ( i.e . their monotonic de- 
cline), these measurements were affected by cooling in the ther- 
mal boundary layer. In spite of errors, Fig. 20 makes it clear that a 
direct extrapolation to d t → ∞ can readily be made. 

Another way of making such an extrapolation has been to plot 
{ I H3O + .H2O  /I H3O + } 1/2  against  1/ d t  [140]  to  give  the  ionic  ratio  for 
1/ d t → 0.  Alternatively,  one  could  equally  have  plotted  the  mea- 
sured ionic ratio against (1/ d 2 
t ). Goodings’s group has favoured this 
and an example is shown in Fig. 21 . This is for aqueous solutions 
2 + N 
2 , 
of magnesium acetate nebulised into two ﬂames of H 
+ 
as in Table 1 [146] , when two of the detected ions were MgOH 
2 
(probably protonated MgOH, rather than Mg + .H 
2 O [146] ) and Mg + . 
Their ratio downstream such a ﬂame also acquired a steady value. 
In Fig. 21 , the values measured at 30 mm from the reaction zones 
of  two  ﬂames,  with  temperatures  as  shown,  are  plotted  against 
1/ d 2 
t , i.e . in effect, the inverse of the oriﬁce’s area, thereby confer-

Fig. 19.  Sketches of the ratio of the measured abundances of a spurious ion to its 
genuine parent, plotted against the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce used. Curve A 
gives the measured ratio assuming the spurious ion is formed entirely in the ex- 
ternal, thermal boundary layer on the tip of the sampling nozzle, as well as during 
the acceleration to a Mach number of unity in the throat of the oriﬁce. Curve B is 
for when the spurious ion is formed only in the supersonic expansion and when 
the sample accelerates to a Mach number of unity at the start of the expansion. 
Both curves A and B can be extrapolated separately to the horizontal line C, which 
is solely for aerodynamic cooling to the conditions at the throat of the oriﬁce. Line 
C exceeds that shown for the undisturbed conditions at the point of sampling in 
the ﬂame. The broken curve D is for real observations, when inﬂuenced by all three 
mechanisms of cooling. 

cur [ 62 , 123 ] over a distance of some 5 oriﬁce diameters before the 
sample reaches the inlet. Assuming that over this distance, the ve- 
locity increases linearly from ∼ 20 to ∼ 900 m/s the cooling time 
varies from ≈ 0.5 μs for a small oriﬁce (diam. 50 μm) to ≈ 2 μs for 
a large hole (diam. 200 μm). These times are of the same order of 
magnitude as the cooling times in the external thermal boundary 
layer. It is likely that this aerodynamic cooling associated with the 
sample accelerating is mainly a matter for the gas close to the axis 
of the system, whereas boundary layer cooling can be greatest in 
those parts of a sample farthest from the axis. 

3.1.5. General considerations of sampling perturbations 

When thinking about sampling perturbations, it looks as if only 
chemical  reactions  with  a  time  constant  less  than  ≈ 0.5  μs  (for 
conditions in the unperturbed ﬂame at 1 bar) need be considered. 
Such a rapid reaction will be equilibrated in a ﬂame. In fact, such 
a chemical equilibrium is probably established extremely early in 
a ﬂame, when gas leaves the reaction zone (where the residence 
time is probably 10–20 μs, depending on the ﬂame) and then en- 
ters the burned gas. In addition, for a chemical equilibrium to re- 
spond to falling temperatures during sampling, the reaction has to 
have a signiﬁcant change of enthalpy. Otherwise, an equilibrium 
with (cid:2)H ∼ 0 would not shift position, if the temperature were al- 
tered. Three modes of cooling have just been described for a sam- 
ple from a  ﬂame entering the  sampling system  of  a mass  spec- 
trometer. First, the sample cools by losing enthalpy to the cooler 
sampling  nozzle.  This  is  more  important  for  a  smaller  sampling 
oriﬁce. Secondly, there is cooling in the subsequent supersonic ex- 
pansion;  this  can  be  more  important  for  a  larger  oriﬁce,  which 
sucks in more gas into the expansion, which is thereby prolonged. 
Thirdly,  independently  of  the  size  of  the  inlet  hole,  the  sample 
cools on being accelerated to a Mach number of unity at the nar- 
rowest part of the oriﬁce. If the chemical reaction has a time con- 
stant less than ≈ 0.5 μs (for conditions at the point of sampling in 
a ﬂame at 1 bar), its position will shift during the acceleration to a 
Mach number of unity, regardless of the oriﬁce’s diameter. Fig. 19 
illustrates these three effects on the observed ratio of the concen-

ring a rationale on the extrapolation. These ﬂames were sampled 
through Goodings’s blunt nozzles with tips of Pt/Ir, as in Fig. 12 . 
Here in Fig. 21 , a linear extrapolation determined the intercept on 
the vertical axis, for d t → ∞ , and so provided the ionic ratio for 
conditions at the throat of the sampling oriﬁce, i.e. for M = 1, with- 
out  any  cooling  of  the  sample  in  a  boundary  layer  or  adiabatic 
expansion. Of course, exactly how an extrapolation, like those in 
Fig. 21 , is done is somewhat arbitrary, as to whether plots of the 
ionic ratio versus 1/ d 2 
t  are better than those against 1/ d t . This ques- 
tion is discussed again below. 

Similar extrapolations have yielded ( I H3O + .H2O /I H3O + ) for several

3.1.7. Kinetics of hydration of H 3 O + 

Returning now to a supersonic expansion, the following ques- 
tion must be asked: exactly when does a chemical equilibrium like 
(XI)  freeze  during  an  expansion  into  the  ﬁrst  vacuum  chamber? 
Bray’s  answer  [150]  was  that  such  an  equilibrium  is  maintained 
in an accelerating ﬂow until the rates of change of both tempera- 
ture and pressure are too large (or quick) for the reaction’s forward 
and backward rates to remain equal. Beyond this point, the com- 
position of the gas tends to some constant value and the equilib- 
rium is said to be frozen. Another way of looking at this question 
would be to assert that in one of these expanding ﬂows, a point 
is reached, where the Knudsen number becomes unity. This might 
be deﬁned as when the mean free path in the expanding sample 
has grown to become equal to the local internal diameter of the 
conical duct. The location of this point depends on the size of the 
inlet oriﬁce, the values of γ and M w , as well as on the initial tem- 
perature  and  pressure  of  the  ﬂame,  etc .  It  has  been  shown  that 
collisions, in one of these expansions of a sample from a ﬂame at 
atmospheric pressure, cease at a distance down the expansion duct 
of roughly 6 - 8 nozzle diameters [ 59 , 134 ]. This is slightly before 
the ﬂow changes to become molecular; this constitutes an upper 
limit. Chemical reaction beyond this point is not possible, because 
subsequently there are no collisions. However, as far as the hydra- 
3 O + is concerned, Eq. (8) gives the equilibrium constant, 
tion of H 
K 11 , as a function of temperature. This consequently provides an 
empirical and realistic way of answering the question of when the 
equilibrium (XI) freezes in a supersonic expansion. 

To pursue this, Fig. 16 showed that when sampling ﬂame 3A 
with a relatively large oriﬁce of diameter 0.17 mm, equilibrium (XI) 
shifted in the supersonic expansion to produce a measured value 
of I H3O + .H2O /I H3O + = 0.70. Such an observation can be expected to 
be  largely  free  of  any  inﬂuence  from  the  effects  of  the  thermal 
boundary  layer,  because  the  oriﬁce  had  a  large diameter  of  0.17 
mm, so that the boundary layers were sucked into the sampling 
nozzle. Eqs. (3) and (4) enable a sample’s temperature and the par- 
tial pressure of H 
2 O to be computed at points along the expan- 
sion, given that their values in the ﬂame are known from Table 1 . 
Next Eq. (8) enables K 11 to be calculated throughout the expansion 
from the known local temperature. In this case, these calculations 
show that the measured I H3O + .H2O /I H3O + = 0.70 corresponds to the 
equilibrium (XI) freezing, when the Mach number, M, had reached 
2.35 and the temperature had dropped to 942 K, from its value at 

the throat of T t = 1651 K. At such a freezing point, the duct’s inter- 
nal diameter had increased to 0.258 mm from its initial value of 
0.17 mm. Also, the velocity had grown to 1374 m/s from its initial 
value of 775 m/s at the start of the expansion. This corresponds to 
a mean velocity of 1075 m/s and an approximate residence time in 
the expansion of ≈ 1 × 10 –7 s, whilst equilibrium (XI) was adjust- 
ing its position. This suggests that the time constant of (XI) was 
τ eq11  ≈ 1 × 10 –7  s, but for conditions at the throat of the oriﬁce, 
when sampling ﬂame 3A. 

This means that in this case, the shift of equilibrium (XI) was 
suﬃcient  to  provide  an  approximate  rule  of  thumb  for  when  a 
chemical reaction occurs in a supersonic expansion of burned gas, 
sampled from ﬂame 3A. It is that the reaction’s time constant, τ , 
must be less than or equal to ≈ 0.1 μs for conditions at the start 
of the expansion, i.e . in the throat of the sampling oriﬁce. For a 
second-order reaction with a T 1/2 dependence of the rate constant, 
this translates to τ ≤ ≈ 5 × 10 –8 s for conditions in the ﬂame being 
sampled. Thus, in this case, it looks as if an equilibrium has to be 
an order of magnitude faster to be shifted in the expansion than 
in just the boundary layer, when the requirement was for τ ≤ ≈
∼ 5 × 10 –7 s. Also, it was noted above that, because a supersonic 
2  as the diluent than with Ar, an 
expansion occurs faster with N 
equilibrium has to be slightly faster to respond, if N 
2 is the 
diluent. Consequently, the requirement for an equilibrium to shift 
in the expansion becomes that τ ≤ ≈ 3 × 10 –8 s for conditions in 
a ﬂame, in which the diluent is not argon or another inert gas.

Given  that  τ eq11 = 1/( k 11 [H

forward  step  to  be  bimolecular  and  not  termolecular,  the  fur- 
ther  approximation  that  τ eq11  ∼ 1  /  ( k 11  [H 
2 O] t ),  might  be 
made.  The  concentration  of  water  in  a  sample  from  ﬂame  3A

3 O + at different points through- 
compute the rate of hydration of H 
3 O + ] set- 
out the expansion and observe the ratio [H 
tling to a constant value inside the expansion. Burdett [ 59 , 151 ] has 
done similar computations. However, there is one more check to 
be made here. This uses the fact that, according to Fig. 16 , reaction 
(XI) was shifted during the supersonic expansion when sampling 
ﬂame  3A.  This  indicates  that  in  ﬂame  3A, τ eq11  <  ≈ 5 × 10 –8  s. 
However, for ﬂame 3 at the same temperature (2041 K) as ﬂame 
3A, there was not a minimum in Fig. 16 , so τ eq11 > ≈ 3 × 10 –8 s 
for ﬂame 3. Putting τ eq11 ∼ 4 × 10 –8 s, gives k 11 ∼ 2.7 × 10 −11 ml 
molecule −1 s −1 . This agrees well with the value of k 11 ≈ 2 × 10 −11 
ml molecule −1 s −1 , deduced above from the freezing point of re- 
action (XI) in the supersonic expansion, when sampling ﬂame 3A. 
These calculations are not accurate enough to assume that k 11 de- 
pends  on  temperature,  but  the  concordance  between  these  two 
different estimates of k 11 conﬁrms the above interpretation of how 
and where a sample is falsiﬁed. 

At this stage it is not clear whether hydration in (XI) proceeds 
by a bimolecular reaction, as assumed above, or whether a third 
body, M, is required for: 

H 3 O + + H 2 O + M → H 3 O + .H 2 O + M. 

(XIa) 

Certainly, the second-order rate constant of k 11 = 2–3 × 10 −11 ml 
molecule −1 s −1 might have been expected to be larger for reaction 
between a positive ion and the polar molecule, H 
2 O. This fact does 
indicate that mono-hydration is a termolecular reaction. If hydra- 
3 O +  involves a three-body reaction, it follows that, be- 
tion of H 
cause ﬂames 3 and 3A have quite different compositions, M would 
be different for these two ﬂames. Consequently, results obtained 
in ﬂames consisting mainly of argon become diﬃcult to compare 
with measurements made in ﬂames diluted with nitrogen. This is 
possibly  one  reason  why  such  a  wide  range  of  values  has  been

such a wide spread is that more work needs to be done, partic-

ularly to decide whether the hydration of H 
ter-molecular reaction. If it is the latter, it is important to discover 
how k 11a depends on temperature, pressure and the nature of the 
third body, M. The question of the critical value of τ eq11 in a ﬂame 
for an equilibrium like (XI) to be shifted in a thermal boundary 
layer is re-visited, when examining the sampling of negative ions 
in Section 4.3 . 

3.1.8. Effects of sampling on a ﬂame’s ﬂow-ﬁeld, etc 

Several questions arise as to how sampling a ﬂame through a 
pin-hole [147] , at the tip of a hollow cone, as in Figs. 5 and 6 , in- 
forms one where a sample originated in the ﬂame? Also, should 
one worry about “Mach–number focussing?” [155] . Has the gas in 
the sample spent a wide range of residence times in the ﬂame ? 
How far into a ﬂame do any effects of suction at the sampling ori- 
ﬁce  penetrate  ?  It  will  be  clear  from  the  earlier  discussion  that 
the answers to these questions will depend inter alia on the di- 
ameter of the sampling hole, which controls the strength of the 
suction. Also, Fig. 17 showed that with a narrow inlet, the sam- 
ple comes mainly after moving slowly through thermal boundary 
layers, which are cooler than the bulk ﬂame. This contrasts with 
a  sample,  when  using  a  wide  oriﬁce.  Then,  the  sample  can  be 
unaffected less by the tip of the cone and its thermal boundary 
layer. It is clear that in general, proﬁles of composition, velocity 
and temperature might be perturbed by sampling; reductions in a 
sample’s temperature were considered above and will be again in 
Section 3.2.2 . 

Some  of  the  questions  above  have  been  addressed  before 
[ 24 , 79 , 123 , 155–165 ], because they are important for sampling neu- 
tral species, as well as charged ones. These complex matters have 
been investigated with a model [123] , which was subsequently ex- 
tended by Smith [165] . The model [123] divided an inﬁnitely wide 
ﬂame  at  atmospheric  pressure  into  two  regions.  Far  away  from 
the sampling oriﬁce, the gas was unaffected by sampling, but near 
the inlet hole, a region of potential ﬂow was assumed. Sampling 
of inviscid, incompressible ﬂuid through the oriﬁce was assumed 
to be into a point-sink, situated at a ﬁxed distance in front of a 
ﬂat plate [123] . The ﬂow-ﬁeld indicated by such a model is shown 
in Figs. 6 and 17 . The dividing line, separating the disturbed and 
undisturbed regions of a ﬂame, was located photographically [123] . 
It turned out [123] to be important that the sampling oriﬁce be 
some  distance  away  from  the  ﬂat  plate  supporting  it,  so  that  a 
conical probe protruding 2 mm or more, as in Fig. 6 , is appropri- 
ate. This contrasts with early instruments, such as in Fig. 2 ; then a 
sample was affected on passing through the boundary layer cover- 
ing the plate holding the sampling nozzle. Nevertheless, the model 
[123]  reveals  that  in  a  typical  sample  using  a  pointed  sampling 
nozzle, the gas experiences a spread of residence times in the dis- 
turbed region of the ﬂame, depending on how far off the axis of 
symmetry the gas was initially located. In fact, 90% of the sam- 
ple typically has a residence time within 10% of the mean time. 
However, the maximum residence time is only ∼ 20% larger than 
the  mean.  This  spread  of  ages  for  the  gas  in  a  sample  is  wider 
when sampling near a burner with a ﬂat face, like that in Fig. 6 . 
One  conclusion  from  this  study  [123]  was  that  a  sampling  cone 
with an internal angle of 60 degrees is satisfactory for studying 

22 

ions,  whose  reactions  are  rapid.  For  sampling  neutral  species,  it 
could be that a smaller internal angle is preferable [123] . Larger 
oriﬁces and nozzles with bigger internal angles result in wider dis- 
tributions  of  residence  times  [165] .  It  was  also  concluded  [123] , 
experimentally  and  theoretically,  that  with  the  set-up  shown  in 
Figs. 5 and 6 , when the distance between the reaction zone and 
sampling oriﬁce is less than about 0.75 ﬂame diameters, the ax- 
ial velocity in the burned gas reaches a minimum. First, a small 
separation between the burner and the sampling hole reduces the 
velocity,  but  at  greater  separations,  the  gases  start  to  accelerate 
into the sampling oriﬁce. This latter effect has concerned others 
[155–165] and caused them, particularly when studying neutrals, 
to assume that “the probe is actually sampling ﬂame gases a few 
oriﬁce diameters upstream of its physical position” [24] . Formulae 
exist [ 159 , 165 ] to locate the shifted position of sampling. It seems 
that such a simple, often used [155–165] , correction to the distance 
scale can be improved by very detailed modelling [163] . The retar- 
dation can be avoided by using a different burner, producing e.g . 
a narrower, Bunsen-type ﬂame, possibly burned on a wider quartz 
tube than used previously [ 6 6–68 , 16 6 ]. The acceleration, induced 
by gases being sucked from a ﬂame into the sampling hole, ap- 
pears to last ∼ 5 oriﬁce diameters and is hard to avoid. Here there 
is scope for more experiments varying the diameter of the sam- 
pling oriﬁce, especially for studying neutral species. Otherwise, it 
seems that if care is taken, molecular beam sampling of ions or 
neutrals can be reliable [166–171] . Of course, if, as in Fig. 5 , a ﬂame 
was being used as a plug-ﬂow reactor to study the kinetics of a 
chemical reaction at the high temperature of a ﬂame’s burned gas, 
such shifts along the ﬂame’s axis become less important. 

Finally,  it  should  be  mentioned  that  the  mixtures  of  Table  1 , 
gave ﬂames at atmospheric pressure with burning velocities suﬃ- 
ciently large that they sat tightly on to the burners of Figs. 5–7 or 
13 . This was possibly no longer the case, if the ﬂame contained 
suﬃcient diluent to reduce its temperature below 1500 K. In such 
a case, the position of the reaction zone, as seen in Fig. 7 , might 
be disturbed by part of it being sucked into the sampling oriﬁce. 
Similar problems might occur, when sampling a ﬂame burning at 
a reduced pressure. However, there was no disturbance at all of 
ﬂames like those in Table 1 , provided the burned gas was hotter 
than 1500 K. 

3.2.1. Enthalpies and entropies of hydration of metallic ions 

Some metals, such as the alkalis and alkaline earths, form posi- 
tive ions (as seen in Figs. 8 and 9 ), such as K + and SrOH + , together 
with free electrons, when in a ﬂame. This confers on a ﬂame the 
useful  property  of  an  appreciable  electrical  conductivity.  Also,  it 
means  that  a  ﬂame  containing  ≈ 1  vol.  %  of  e.g .  relatively  eas- 
ily ionised potassium is possibly suitable for generating electricity 
directly from the ﬂame by magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) means 
[ 131,172 , 173 ]. For this, an electrically conducting ﬂame would be 
burned  between  the  poles  of  a  large  magnet,  so  that  free  elec- 
trons  and  positive  ions  leave  the  ﬂame  in  directions  orthogonal 
to  both  the  ﬂow  of  hot  gas  and  the  magnetic  ﬁeld.  Collection 
of  the  charged  species  by  electrodes  on  each  side  of  the  ﬂame 
is then possible. In that case, because an electric current is pro- 
duced without raising steam, the second law of thermodynamics 
is avoided. There was considerable interest in MHD some 60 years 
ago [ 172 , 173 ], mainly for augmenting conventional schemes burn- 
ing coal for generating electricity; such a scheme was capable of 
increasing the overall eﬃciency of producing electricity from ∼ 30 
to ∼ 65 %. These innovations were abandoned for several reasons, 
such as problems with materials and the economics of the process. 
Another reason for the ionisation of metals in ﬂames being im- 
portant is both a rocketry and military one (involving stealth air- 
craft), described fully elsewhere [ 131 , 172 ]. The turbulent exhaust 
from e.g . a rocket can contain appreciable amounts of free elec- 

A.N. Hayhurst 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 88 (2022) 100927 

trons,  produced by the  ionisation of  metallic impurities in a  re- 
gion, where there is considerable after-burning of what is a large, 
fuel-rich ﬂame [ 131 , 172 , 174 , 175 ]. The result is that the microwave 
beams communicating, e.g. between earth and the rocket, are at- 
tenuated and modulated, so that signals to and from the vehicle 
can become very noisy. Here then is an unwelcome aspect of the 
ionisation  of  metals  in  a  ﬂame.  It  is  not  always  possible  to  as- 
sume that the levels of ionisation in an exhaust plume are those 
for equilibrium, so that a detailed knowledge of the kinetics of pro- 
duction and recombination of ions is crucial. It is noteworthy that 
MHD requires high electron densities in a working ﬂame, but good 
communications with a rocket depend on minimising the concen- 
trations  of  free  electrons  in  the  vehicle’s  exhaust  plume.  Conse- 
quently, negative ions, which are stable, when the exhaust plumes 
from rockets and aircraft cool, will be formed in exothermic reac- 
tions. Consequently, additives, e.g . of the halogens, phosphorus or 
boron, etc became topics of interest [ 59 , 82 , 138 , 174 ]; perhaps there 
are other suitable additives. Finally, it might be noted that ions are 
emitted by aircraft engines [176] , as well as by spark-ignition en- 
gines [177] powering e.g . automobiles. 

The ions formed by an alkali metal or alkaline earth are usu- 
ally  studied  in  a  laboratory  ﬂame  by  nebulising  an  aqueous  so- 
lution of e.g . NaOH, NaCl or SrCl 
2  into the mixture of gases sup- 
plied to the burner. For this, a conventional pneumatic atomiser 
[ 65 , 70 , 129 , 135 , 144 ], powered by part of the ﬂow of N 
2 or Ar ( i.e. 
the diluent) has been often used. Alternatively, an ultrasonic neb- 
2  or Ar. [178] . When 
uliser can be operated with a low ﬂow of N 
nebulising an aqueous solution of NaCl or NaOH into an average 
ﬂame at ∼ 2200 K, sodium rapidly exists as free atoms, or ions, 
Na + , or molecules of the hydroxide, NaOH [ 69–72 , 130 ]. Techniques 
are available to calibrate an atomiser [65] ; for a solution 10 −2 mo- 
lar in sodium, the total mole fraction of all sodium species in the 
burned gas usually amounts to ∼ 10 −7 [179] . This means that the 
metallic additive is usually present in negligible quantities and is 
not  likely  to  interfere  with  the  ﬂame  under  study.  The  simplest 
case is an alkali metal added to a ﬂame of either H 
2 or a hydrocar- 
2 . In that case, ions like Na + or K + are formed 
bon like CH 
in the ﬂame by two main mechanisms. First, atoms of the metal 
ionise thermally in collisions with other molecules, M, [ 54 , 75–78 ] 
in e.g. : 

4 or C 

2 H 

Na + M → Na + + e − + M. 

(XII) 

This reaction has an activation energy equal to the ionisation 
energy of an atom of the metal [164–167] , but the pre-exponential 
factor  of  the  second-order  rate  constant  is  interestingly  ∼ 10 3 
times larger than the gas-kinetic value. This makes electronic ex- 
citation  of  a  metal  atom  in  (XII)  rather  complicated  [ 54 , 75–78 ], 
when it occurs in a ﬂame and results in the limiting case of ioni- 
sation. The second process for ionising a metal in a ﬂame involves 
[ 54,69 , 75,132,179–182 ] either 

Na + H 3 O + → Na + .H 2 O + H 

or 

NaOH + H 3 O + → Na + .H 2 O + H 2 O. 

(XIII) 

(XIV) 

In either reaction (XIII) or (XIV), instead of the product being 
Na + .H 
2 O, it could well be the separate species Na +  and H 
2 O. Of 
course, reactions (XII)–(XIV) are too slow to be at equilibrium, ex- 
cept above 2500 K, as noted in Figs. 8 and 9 . However, the typical 
metallic ions, Na + and its monohydrate, Na + .H 
2 O, have concentra-

being at equilibrium in the burned gas region. Reaction (XV) is in- 
vestigated below. The alkaline earths have been studied in less de- 
tail and more work is needed on them. They mainly exist as the 
hydroxides Sr(OH) 
2 and SrOH in a fuel-rich ﬂame, but with smaller 
amounts  of  the  oxide,  SrO,  and  free  atoms,  Sr.  Ions  are  created 
[ 55 , 183–186 ] in either: 

Sr + OH → SrOH + + e −

or 

SrO + H → SrOH + + e −. 

(XVI) 

(XVII) 

These two chemi-ionisation steps are indistinguishable, because 

the reaction: 

SrO + H 2 = Sr + H 2 O 

(XVIII) 

is  rapidly  equilibrated  in  a  ﬂame  [ 73 , 186 , 187 ],  so  that  the  ra- 
tio [Sr][OH]/[SrO][H] is constant along the burned gas, where the 
temperature is steady. To decide whether reaction (XVI) or (XVII) 
is  the  faster  might  require  burning  very  oxygen-rich  ﬂames,  in 
which the ratio of [SrO]/[Sr] is governed by a different reaction like 
Sr + O = SrO.

As for experimental work on ions of the alkali metals and their 
monohydrates, the solid line in Fig. 23 shows a plot of the ion sig- 
2 , burn- 
nal for sodium ions, measured along a ﬂame of H 
ing on a Pyrex capillary tube (i.d. 2 mm) at atmospheric pressure. 
The  ﬂame  [ 50 , 188 ]  had  a  conical  reaction  zone  (thickness  ∼ 0.1 
mm), which extended ∼ 10 mm from the end of the tube. This 
enabled either side of the ﬂame’s reaction zone to be sampled. In 
Na + .H2O is shown in Fig. 23 by the dotted 
addition, the ratio I 
line, for a total concentration of all sodium species amounting to 
a mole fraction of ∼ 10 −7 . When sampling near the reaction zone, 
both plots in Fig. 23 rise sharply, but the ratio of the two ions soon 
becomes constant over a distance of ∼ 10 mm, reﬂecting the ex- 
tent of the isothermal region in the burned gas of this ﬂame. This 
constant value of the ratio was not affected by nebulising a differ- 
ent strength of aqueous NaCl into the gas mixture supplied to the 
burner. Nor were the temperature [129] or the ratio I 
altered by adding ≈ 0.5 vol. % of C 
though  both  I

Na + .H2O  were  then  increased  signiﬁcantly

Fig. 24.  Plots of ( I Na + .H2O /I Na + ) against the reciprocal of the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce. These plots are for either 3 or 20 mm downstream of the reaction zone of a 
ﬂame, deﬁned in Table 1 . Chromium sampling nozzles were used; ion ratios were corrected for scattering, as discussed above. From [137] . 

[50] . Higher hydrates of Na +  were usually observed. Fig. 23 fur- 
nishes  evidence  that  reaction  (XV)  is  equilibrated  in  the  burned 
gas, where reaction (XII) is producing Na +  ions at a nearly con- 
stant rate. 

Plots of the constant value of the ratio of ion currents, ( I Na + .H2O 
/  I Na + ) ,  versus  the  diameter  of  the  sampling  oriﬁce  used  were 
found  to  be  the  same  shape  as  Fig.  20  for  I H3O + .H2O /I H3O +  along 
ﬂames diluted with N 
2 . Thus, this ionic ratio is highest for small 
inlet oriﬁces and becomes progressively smaller for larger sampling 
holes, conﬁrming that more hydrate of Na +  was formed when a 
sample was cooled in the external thermal boundary layer on the 
tip of the sampling cone, including the acceleration to M = 1. Thus, 
it appears that, after a sample has entered the chromium sampling 
cone, the reaction: 

Na + + H 2 O + M → Na + .H 2 O + M 

(XIX) 

is too slow to occur in the supersonic expansion of a sample. This 
is true, even when sampling a ﬂame diluted with argon. No doubt, 
reaction (XIX) is a three-body process for the atomic ion Na + and 
is consequently too slow to occur in a supersonic expansion. 

Fig. 24 shows plots of ( I Na + .H2O / I Na + ) against the reciprocal of 
the oriﬁce diameter used at different distances along a variety of 
ﬂames. Straight lines can be ﬁtted, even though some curvature 
appears with hotter ﬂames and with smaller inlet holes. Accord- 
ingly, these plots in Fig. 24 can be extrapolated to yield the ratio 
of the two ions for an inﬁnitely wide sampling hole. This situation, 
obtained by extrapolating ion ratios to an inﬁnite oriﬁce diame- 
ter, refers to there being no cooling of the sample in either the 
supersonic expansion or in the thermal boundary layer. However, 
the sample was cooled by being accelerated to a Mach number of 
unity  at  the  narrowest  point  of  the  inlet  to  the  sampling  cone, 
f /(1 + γ ). Also, the concentration 
where the temperature is T t = 2 T 
of H 
2 O there can be calculated using Eq. (3) , enabling the equilib- 
rium constant of reaction (XV) to be derived for the temperature 
and conditions at the throat of the inlet nozzle.

Of course, the partial pressure of water, p

The only unknown in Eqs. (9) and (10) is T 
ple’s temperature in the throat without any boundary layer cool- 
ing) can be derived from the temperature in the ﬂame using T 
f / 
T ∞ = (1 + γ )/2 from Eq. (4) with M = 1. This means that any mea- 
surement of ( I Na + .H2 O / I Na + ) 
d t for a general inlet of diameter, d t , can 
d t , the sample’s temperature 
be transformed to yield a value for T 
when in the throat of the oriﬁce. 

Fig. 26 shows some results plotted as ( T ∞ –T 

d t ), i.e . an estimate 
of the mean cooling of the sample in the external thermal bound- 
ary layer for a diameter, d t . These values of ( T ∞ –T 
d t ) omit any cool- 
ing by aerodynamic effects, which have been subtracted out. Plots 
are shown in Fig. 26 for three different ions in three ﬂames (see 
Table 1 for details) with argon as the diluent and sampling 20 mm 
downstream of the reaction zone with a Cr nozzle. There is no sys- 
tematic dependence of the boundary layer cooling on the mass or 
identity  of  the  ion.  Even  so,  the  means  of  the  three  plots  for  a 
ﬂame give the boundary layer cooling to within ± 30 K. Clearly, 
the cooling is greater with a smaller sampling oriﬁce and a hotter 
ﬂame containing less argon, when this cooling can be as much as 
400 K with the hottest ﬂame. 

3.2.3. Modelling the cooling of a sample in a thermal boundary layer 
As  for  modelling  the  results  of  Fig.  26 ,  the  ﬁrst  attempt 
[124] produced plots very similar in shape to those in Fig. 26 , i.e . 
the computed magnitude of the mean cooling and its dependence 
on the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce were comparable to those 
in Fig. 26 . The computations were based on the correlation [191] : 

Nu = hr/λ = 0 . 93 R e 0 . 5 

P r 0 . 4 , 

(11) 

for  near  an  axisymmetric  stagnation  region,  where  the  charac- 
teristic  length  in  both  the  Nusselt  (Nu)  and  Reynolds  number 
(Re = rV/ ν) is r , the radius of curvature of the cone’s outer surface 
at the stagnation point. Also, λ is the thermal conductivity of the 
gaseous sample, ν is its kinematic viscosity and V is the axial ve- 
locity of the ﬂame. An energy balance gives: 
h A n ( T 

f − T n ) = Qσ C p( T 

f − T t ) . 

(12) 

Here h is the heat transfer coeﬃcient between the sample and 
the tip of the sampling cone, A n is the surface area of the nozzle’s 
tip actually exposed to the sample, Q is the volumetric sampling 
rate in m 3 /s, σ is the molar density of the sample and C p  is its 
molar heat capacity at constant pressure. The mean temperatures 
are T 
f in the ﬂame, T n at the nozzle’s tip and T t refers to the sample 
at the throat of the inlet. A dimensionless (or fractional) cooling 
was deﬁned as:

magnitude  are (cid:2)H 0 
and CaOH + , with alkaline ions like Na + having smaller (cid:2)H 0 
20 . The 
value of (cid:2)H 0 
20  for Li +  possibly looks large; its value is discussed 
in Section 3.3.1 . The values of (cid:2)S 0 
20 in Table 2 fall in a much nar- 
rower  range from − 110 ± 10  J  mol −1  K −1  for  monohydration of 
the proton to − 80 ± 10 J mol −1  K −1  for Cu + . This is very much 
as expected. The ions of the alkali metals, from Li + to Rb + , form a 
nice sequence in Table 2 . The hydration of negative ions merits a 
systematic study. 

3.2.2. Measurement of the cooling of a sample in a thermal boundary 
layer 

It was pointed out above that a sample from a ﬂame might be 
cooled in three regions of a sampling system. However, a reaction 
like (XX) might be too slow to occur in the supersonic expansion. 
Thus, Fig. 24 showed that a set of values of the ratio: I Na + .H2O /I Na + , 
measured at the same point in a ﬂame with differently sized sam- 
pling  oriﬁces,  could  be  extrapolated  to  give  the  ratio  for  an  in- 
ﬁnitely wide oriﬁce. This is the case for several ions, some of which 
are listed in Table 2 . Measured values of the equilibrium constant 
of (XX) at different temperatures in the throat of the sampling ori- 
ﬁce were plotted in Fig. 25 . In general, with a real sampling hole of 
diameter, d t , the measured ionic ratio will have been perturbed by 
changes of temperature and pressure experienced by the sample in 
the external boundary layer and during aerodynamic cooling. This 
is because reaction (XX) is too slow to occur in a supersonic ex- 
pansion. It means that the extrapolations in Fig. 24 (or an alterna- 
tive like Fig. 21 ) to d t → ∞ give the ratio of the hydrated and par- 
ent ions, after having been perturbed in both the thermal bound- 
ary layers and after having been accelerated to a Mach number of 
unity  in  the  throat  of  the  sampling  oriﬁce.  The  actual  measure- 
ments for a diameter d t can be rationalised by assuming the sam- 
ple’s temperature at the throat of the nozzle, where (XX) freezes, 
d t , but is T ∞  (or T t ) for d t → ∞ . The ratio of the equilibrium 
is T

Fig. 26.  Plots of ( T ∞ - T d ), i.e . the mean cooling of a sample in the boundary layer alone, omitting the “aerodynamic cooling”. The plots are versus the diameter of the 
sampling oriﬁce and are for sampling 20 mm downstream of the reaction zones of the ﬂames shown. Thus Ar was the diluent and chromium sampling nozzles were used 
[137] . 

tant factor is again the oriﬁce’s diameter, which controls the frac- 
tion of a sample cooled by contacting the nozzle. Also, the model 
indicated  a  value  of  the  mean  residence  time  (correct  to  an  or- 
der of magnitude) for a sample in the external boundary layer of 
≈ 2.0 μs for d t = 0.085 mm. As noted above, this is probably an 
over-estimate, because the model neglects any increases in veloc- 
ity caused by suction at the oriﬁce. 

It  is  important  to  note  that  Smith  [165]  extended  the  above 
treatment and deduced that increasing the internal angle of the 
sampling cone enhances the cooling experienced by a sample. It 
also results in a ﬂame being disturbed more. Interestingly, more 
of the nozzle is contacted by a sample, if the inlet diameter is in- 
creased or the velocity of the burned gas is decreased [165] . At this 
stage one should applaud the advent of more sophisticated mod- 
elling, such as [ 161 , 164 ], to address these problems. Also, it should 
be noted that attempts have been made [192] to measure the tem- 
perature of a sampling nozzle, when in a ﬂame. The results con- 
ﬁrm previous estimates. 

It  is  interesting  to  check  Eq.  (14)  against  the  observation  in 
Fig.  16  that  samples,  from  a  ﬂame  with  Ar  as  the  diluent,  are 
cooled more, by losing heat to a sampling nozzle, than when N 
2 
is the diluent. Eq. (14) shows the fractional cooling, (cid:8), of a sam- 
ple depends on several physical properties ( e.g. λ, Pr, σ , C p , ν), as 
well as on V, A n , Q and r . Of the physical properties, only C p and ν
change in the right direction to explain this observation, when the 
diluent N 
2 is replaced by Ar. However, the accompanying changes 
in V, A n and r are capable of explaining the increased (cid:8) from al- 
2 to Ar. This means that the cooling of a 
tering the diluent from N 
sample in a thermal boundary layer on the exterior of a sampling 
cone is surprisingly complex and not at all attributable to one sim- 
ple aspect of the cooling. 

3.2.4. Thickness of the momentum boundary layer on the front plate 
The ﬂame, as seen in Fig. 5 or 7, burns against an almost ﬂat, 
water-cooled  plate,  from  which  protrudes  the  conical,  sampling 
nozzle.  Here  the  aim  was  for  the  tip  of  the  nozzle  to  be  out- 
side the momentum boundary layer, created by burning a ﬂame 
against a ﬂat plate. Computations of the thickness of this bound- 

Fig. 27.  Computed fractional temperature drop, (cid:8), plotted against the radius of the 
sampling oriﬁce for a ﬂame at 2570 K (unburnt composition: H 2 /O 2 /N 2 = 3/1/2; ve- 
locity in burnt gas = 27.1 m/s). The distances of the oriﬁce from the reaction zone 
were zero ( z d = 2.0 mm) and 25 mm ( z d = 7.0 mm). From [124] . 

Of course, Q and r depend on the internal diameter of the ori- 
ﬁce. Some computed plots of (cid:8) against the radius of the sampling 
hole are shown in Fig. 27 for two different values of z 
d , the length 
of ﬂame disturbed by the sampling system of a pointed nozzle pro- 
truding from a ﬂat plate, as in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 27 they represent ex- 
treme  values  for  z 
d .  It  is  clear  that  Fig.  27  is  not  very  sensitive 
to z 
d ; also, Fig. 27 matches Fig. 26 . The above model actually as- 
sumes (cid:8) << 1 [124] , so that the values of (cid:8) in Fig. 27 must be 
upper estimates. However, there is good agreement [124] between 
Figs. 26 and 27 for oriﬁces with diameters larger than 0.1 mm, in 
that the measured and predicted mean coolings of a sample agree. 
This model [124] led to Fig. 17 [53] , which reveals that a sample 
from a ﬂame can be divided into two parts, viz a core, unaffected 
by any contact with the sampling nozzle, and also an outer region, 
cooled by contacting the metallic cone. Evidently here, the impor-

ary layer [123] indicate that for a ﬂame (unburnt composition by 
2 = 3.5 / 1.0 / 2.0) at 2445 K it had a maximum 
vol.: H 
thickness  of  0.65  mm.  For  a  cooler  ﬂame  at  2025  K,  this  maxi- 
mum thickness grew to 0.9 mm [123] . The increase was caused by 
changes in the composition and temperature of the burned gas and 
also by an increased kinematic viscosity, as discussed below. These 
thicknesses  were  corroborated  by  photographs  of  similar  ﬂames 
[ 85 , 123 ], as well as by measurements of the discharge coeﬃcient 
equal to unity, discussed in Section 3.1.4 . At this stage, it is suﬃ- 
cient to note that Figs. 5 and 6 show the tip of the sampling noz- 
zle at least 4 mm upstream of the cooled plate. Such a situation 
is more satisfactory than that seen in e.g . the earlier instrument of 
Fig. 2 . 

3.2.5. Sampling neutral species 

At this stage, it is worth examining some reactions of neutral 
species to check whether in a low-pressure ﬂame they form any 
equilibria, which are fast enough to shift during sampling into a 
mass spectrometer. Consider a ﬂame at 2300 K, burning at the re- 
duced pressure of 0.05 bar, in which case, the mean free path is λ
≈ 11 μm in the burned gas. At the throat of the sampling nozzle, a 
sample’s temperature has fallen to 1790 K, assuming γ = 1.57, so 
it is a ﬂame with Ar as its diluent. In addition, the pressure in the 
throat has dropped to 0.025 bar, so λ at the throat has increased 
to ≈ 17 μm. Next, consider the sample in the expansion duct. Ac- 
cording to Eq. (6) with M equal to 6, the internal diameter of the 
expansion duct is then d = 4.7 d t . Also, Eq. (4) indicates that the 
temperature there has dropped to 204 K. In addition, Eq. (3) gives 
the local pressure as having fallen to 6.3 × 10 –5  bar, when M = 6. 
This means that the local mean free path has risen to ≈ 780 μm. 
As a crude approximation, suppose the diameter of the sampling 
oriﬁce is just large enough for the internal diameter of the expan- 
sion duct, where M has reached 6, to be equal to the local mean 
free path. In that case, collisions have certainly stopped in the sam- 
ple, but might have done so at a slightly smaller Mach number. 
Because M = 6 and d = λ = 780 μm = 4.7 d t , so the inlet oriﬁce has 
a diameter d t = 166 μm. This means that by using an inlet hole of 
diameter 166 μm or less to sample this ﬂame at 2300 K and 0.05 
bar, collisions will have ceased in the expansion at or before M = 6. 
By comparison, a ﬂame at 2300 K and at an atmospheric pres- 
sure  of  1  bar  with  the  same γ = 1.57  has  a  mean  free  path  of 
λ = 0.55 μm in its burned gas, but in the throat T t = 1790 K, p t = 0.5 
bar and λt = 0.85 μm. When M has grown to 6 in the expansion, 
Eq. (6) still indicates that d / d t = 4.7, together with a local tempera- 
ture now as low as 204 K, a pressure of 1.3 × 10 –3 bar and a mean 
free path of λ ∼ 40 μm. Again putting d equal to the local mean 
free path, one has: d = 40 μm = 4.7 d t , one obtains d t = 8.5 μm. This 
would suggest that if d t = 100 μm, collisions of neutrals are still 
occurring, when M = 6 in a sample from a ﬂame at 2300 K and 
1 bar.  However, if  the pressure in the ﬂame  were reduced by a 
factor of 20 to 0.05 bar and d t  kept at 100 μm, collisions in the 
expansion would cease well before M reaches 6. The conclusion is 
consequently that sampling a low-pressure ﬂame minimises sam- 
pling  perturbations  during  a  supersonic  expansion.  In  that  case, 
one should ask if there are problems created by a sample passing 
through a boundary layer at a reduced pressure just before enter- 
ing the sampling oriﬁce ? 

Reducing the pressure in a ﬂame by a factor of e.g . 20 does not 
alter the volumetric ﬂow rate of gas, Q , through the sampling ori- 
ﬁce. That there is still choked ﬂow suggests that the ﬂow-ﬁeld in 
the boundary layer is largely unchanged. However, Eq. (14) gave 
the fractional cooling of a sample in the boundary layer. The ther- 
mal conductivity, λ, and dynamic viscosity do not vary with pres- 
sure, but the molar density, σ , does and consequently the kine- 
matic  viscosity,  ν,  does  also.  Given  the  velocity  in  the  bound- 
ary layer hardly changes, Eq. (14) indicates that a sample will be 

cooled  to  lower  temperatures  with  a  low  pressure  ﬂame  being 
sampled. Smith has conﬁrmed this conclusion [165] . However, an 
important question is the mean residence time of a sample in a 
relatively cool boundary layer. The thickness of a boundary layer 
has [123] the form: 
(cid:9)
v 
V 

1 / 2 
. 

δ ∝ 

(15) 

(cid:8)

Given that the kinematic viscosity, ν, increases if the pressure 
falls, the chances are that δ will also increase. This suggests that 
the  mean  residence  of  a  sample  in  the  external  boundary  layer 
could increase from ∼ 0.5 μs at 1 bar to 1 to 2 μs at 0.05 bar. The 
result is likely to be that slightly slower equilibria will be shifted 
in the boundary layer and also to a greater extent, because of the 
enhanced cooling. Here then is the direction of change.

2 ,  with  mole  fractions  of  H 

To assess the consequences of these probable changes, the time 
constant for a fast reaction like e.g . reaction (III) must be estimated 
at 2300 K and 0.05 bar. It is 
τeq 3 ≈ 1 / k 3 { ( C H2 + C H2O / K 3 ) } 
by  analogy  with  Eq.  (1) .  Assuming  a  fuel-rich  ﬂame  of 
2 O  in  the  burned 
H 
2  and  H 
3 ∼ 1.3 × 10 –11 ml 
gas of, respectively, 0.15 and 0.2, together with k 
3 ≈ 6 [193] , then τ
molecule –1 s [8] and K 
eq3 ≈ 2.8 μs. This value 
is larger than the rule of thumb’s indication that τ eq3  should be 
below ≈ 0.5 μs, or even 5 × 10 –8 s in order for equilibrium (III) to 
be shifted in its exothermic direction during the supersonic expan- 
sion. Consequently, in that case of a low pressure ﬂame, reaction 
(III) is too slow at low pressures to be perturbed. This conﬁrms 
that the mass spectrometry of neutrals in low-pressure ﬂames op- 
erates on a secure basis. However, for the same ﬂame burning at 
atmospheric pressure, the predicted τ eq3 is reduced by a factor of 
20 to ≈ 0.13 μs, so the equilibrium is likely to be shifted during 
sampling this ﬂame at 1 bar, when a sample passes through the 
thermal boundary layer. As an aside comment, equilibria involving 
termolecular reactions, like (VII) and (VIII), are slower and so do 
not normally shift when sampling a low-pressure ﬂame. Even the 
equilibrium H + O 
2 + M in a very oxygen-rich ﬂame at 1 
bar is too slow, in spite of its negative activation energy [ 193 , 194 ].

The  ion  Li +  is  the  smallest  positive  ion  of  any  metal  and 
is  consequently  likely  to  form  many  cluster  ions.  Such  mat- 
ters  have  been  studied  [189]  in  near  1-dimensional  ﬂames  of

C 
was to burn at 1 atm. several fuel-rich, ﬂat ﬂames, whose burned 
gases (ranging from 20 0 0 to 2500 K, but at 1 atm.) contained ap- 
preciable  quantities  of  CO  and  were  a  good  approximation  to  a 
plug-ﬂow  reactor  [195] .  The  atomic  ratio  C/O  was  between  0.53

and 0.65; this resulted in CO and CO 
centrations in the burnt gas, without any soot present. Some de-

ing the rate of sampling. Rather, it is that the reduced temperature

bly because these ﬂames of C 
2 + Ar it is γ ∼ 1.57, resulting 
2 + O 
1.24, whereas for a ﬂame of H 
in a slower expansion into the ﬁrst vacuum chamber. Thus, these 
2  do have their own features. One is that the 
ﬂames of C 
axial velocity of the ﬂame gas is reduced by entraining the sur- 
rounding air, especially downstream of the burner. In addition, H 
2 
diffuses  radially  outwards  from  the  burned  gas  and  burns  as  a 
diffusion ﬂame in the surrounding atmospheric air, as previously 
2  [125] . This increases the mean 
noticed for rich ﬂames of H 
molecular mass of a gaseous sample taken far downstream in the 
burned gas and consequently decreases the sampling rate. In addi- 
tion, this loss of H 
2 decreases the thickness of the thermal bound- 
ary layer (resulting in a hotter sample), because of changes in e.g . 
the  kinematic  viscosity  of  the  sample.  A  further  complication  is 
that the C 
2 ﬂame 5, like them all, was burnt horizontally and, 
being the slowest moving, tapered upwards nearer the tip. Con- 
sequently, the shortest ﬂame 5 experienced most entrainment of 
air. Finally, the temperature of the chromium sampling nozzle does 
decrease, when sampling farther downstream of the reaction zone. 
This is because the radicals H and OH have their largest concen- 
trations  nearest  to  a  ﬂame’s  reaction  zone,  so  the  heat  released 
when they recombine on a chromium nozzle is less, when sam- 
pling farther downstream, where the nozzle, as well as the sample 
become cooler. These effects are commonly encountered [145] , but 
are seen by e.g . the ionic ratio in Fig. 30 rising downstream in the 
cooler ﬂames 4 and 5.

These plots in Fig. 31 were extrapolated to yield values of K 20 
for d t → ∞ by re-plotting them against 1/ d t , as was done in Fig. 24 . 
The resulting values of K 20 can be assumed to be those for choked 
conditions at the throat of the oriﬁce, so that [H

to  calculate  K 20  for  the  van’t  Hoff plots  of  log e  K 20  versus  1/ T t ,

mating the entropy change for a chemical reaction has been called 
[198] “the third law method”, because the third law of thermody-

because of its high temperature and particularly rapid velocity in 
the  burned  gas.  This  meant  that  a  smaller  fraction  of  the  sam- 
ple from ﬂame 1 had been cooled on passing through the bound- 
ary  layer,  as  well  as  accelerating  into  the  sampling  oriﬁce.  Oth- 
erwise, Fig. 31 indicates that much of the observed monohydrate 
of  Li +  was  produced,  when  using  smaller  sampling  holes.  How-

Apart from the very coolest ﬂame 5, Fig. 34 shows monotonic 
falls in K 25  for ﬂames 1–4, when a larger diameter was used for 
the sampling oriﬁce. This general behaviour indicates that equilib- 
rium  (XXV)  is  then  responding  to  a  sample  being  cooled  in  the 
thermal boundary layer on the high pressure side of the sampling 
oriﬁce. However, ﬂame 5 in Fig. 34 shows a minimum, indicating 
that,  when  a  large  sampling  hole  was  used,  a  sample  from  the 
coolest of these ﬁve ﬂames might have been cooled in the super- 
sonic expansion. However, it was seen above that problems were 
experienced with the coolest and shortest ﬂame 5, e.g . because of 
the ﬂame tapering upwards at the tip. Consequently, for ﬂame 5, 
the single point for the largest oriﬁce was ignored in the extrap- 
olation  to  an  inﬁnitely  wide  oriﬁce.  Otherwise,  all  the  values  of 
K 25 in Fig. 34 were extrapolated to obtain its value for when each 
ﬂame was at a Mach number of unity and not cooled by either 
the supersonic expansion or by passing through a thermal bound- 
ary layer. These values are shown as a van’t Hoff plot of Log e K 25

From [189] . 

These  proﬁles  in  Fig.  36  were  again  for  each  ﬂame  sampled 
through an oriﬁce of diameter 100 μm in a chromium sampling 
nozzle. The ratios of the cluster and parent ions reach very large 
values in the cool, reaction zone, where I 
Li +  is low. In ﬂames 1, 
2, and 4 they reach a fairly steady value, when sampling down- 
stream in the burned gas. However, the ratios for ﬂames 3 and 5 
continue to rise in the burned gas; these growths can be ascribed 
to  the  sample  being  cooled  more  when  sampling  farther  down- 
stream, where the nozzle is heated less by radical recombination. 
Broadly speaking, some of this was also seen in Figs. 30 and 33 . 
Thus, it appears that the reaction: 

Li + + CO = Li + .CO 

(XXVI) 

is equilibrated and shifted to form more Li + .CO, when a sample 
was cooled. 

Li + .CO /I 

The  value  of  ( I 

Li + )  was  measured  at  15  mm  from  the 
burner for ﬂames 1, 2 and 3, but at 8 mm along the cooler ﬂames 
4 and 5. Values for sampling oriﬁces with different diameters are 
collected in Fig. 37 as the equilibrium constant of (XXVI) for all ﬁve 
ﬂames, plotted against d t , the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce.

when a small inlet hole was used. The monotonic fall of the ionic 
ratio for ﬂame 5 shows that reaction (XXVI) was shifted, when a 
sample was cooled, whilst passing through the external boundary 
layers, just before it entered the sampling hole. This contrasts with 
ﬂames 1, 2 and 4, which in Fig. 37 show slight minima, indicating 

In Fig. 37 , ﬂame 5 produces strikingly large ratios for I

that with a large sampling oriﬁce, equilibrium (XXVI) was shifted 
to form more (but only slightly more) Li + .CO, when a large inlet 
hole was used. The plots in Fig. 37 for these ﬁve ﬂames were ex- 
trapolated  to  d t → ∞  for  ﬂames  3  and  5,  but  separately  to  both 
d t → 0  and  d t → ∞  (as  conjectured  in  Fig.  19 )  to  yield  just  one 
value  of  the  equilibrium  constant,  K 26 ,  for  choked  conditions  at 
the throat of the sampling oriﬁce. Here it is worth commenting 
that the extrapolation of an ionic ratio to d t → 0 was usually done 
by plotting the ratio against 1/ d t  and then locating the intercept 
for 1/ d t → 0. Such a procedure yielded a very similar intercept to 
that from an alternative plot of the ionic ratio versus 1/ d 2 
t . Conse- 
quently, how the extrapolation is done is arbitrary and a matter of 
choice. 

The resulting ﬁve values of the equilibrium constant of (XXVI) 
are plotted as Log e K 26 versus 1/ T t in Fig. 38 . The slope and inter- 
cept, respectively, indicate that (cid:2)H o 
26  = – 67 ± 25 kJ mol –1  and 
26 = – 82 ± 25 J mol –1 K –1 , both at an average throat temper- 
(cid:2)S o 
ature of T t = 20 0 0 K. These values indicate (cid:2)H o 
26 = – 60 ± 28 kJ 
26 = – 77 ± 26 J mol –1 K –1 at 300 K. It is worth not- 
mol –1 and (cid:2)S o 
ing that a molecule of H 
2 O has a dipole moment of 6.2 C m; that 
of CO is smaller at 4.0 C m. This is in line with the binding energy 
for Li + .H 

2 O being larger than that for Li + .CO. 

This study of lithium as an additive has shown that ﬂames can 
be designed for a speciﬁc purpose. Here high concentrations of CO 
were needed to promote the formation of Li + .CO. In addition, use 
was made of techniques for estimating (cid:2)S ° for reactions (XX) and 
(XXV). The result is a consistent set of thermodynamic data, col- 
lected below in Table 5 . In addition, it is possible to comment on 
the kinetics of some of the reactions of species containing lithium. 
3 O + with LiOH in (XXIII) 
Thus, the rate constant of the reaction of H 
has  been  deduced  [189]  to  be  k 23 = 2.2 × 10 –9  ion –1  ml  s –1 ,  in 
agreement with the direct measurement [182] of 2.5 × 10 –9 ion –1 
ml s –1 . In addition, reaction (XXVI), involving the ion, Li + and the 
simple diatomic molecule, CO, can be expected to be termolecular

The ions from the non-metallic additive, ammonia, to the un- 
burnt gas supplied to a ﬂame of H 
2  proved instructive 
[45] in many ways, bearing in mind that ammonium perchlorate is 
a major component of some propellants [199] . For this work, the 
ﬂames  used  were  similar  to  those  listed  in  Table  1 ,  except  that 
the  ratio  of  H 
2  in  the  unburnt  gas  was  much  higher  and  in 
the range 6–9 by volume [45] . Details of the un-doped ﬂames are 
shown in Table 4 . These amounts of H 
2  are large enough for H 
2 
to act as a diluent. The ﬁnal temperatures were between 1660 and 
2059 K, making them cooler than the ﬂames in Table 1 . Also, the 
ﬂames of Table 4 were too fuel-rich and cool for NO to be pro- 
duced in their burnt gases. Ammonia came from a cylinder con- 
2 and typically had a mole fraction of ∼
taining 5 vol. % of NH 
0.25 vol. % in the unburnt gas. These ﬂames, burned on the Méker 
burner of Figs. 5–7 , were seen to have luminous, white reaction

there [131] . It was noted above that any molecule of NH 
3 in the re- 
action zone of a fuel-rich ﬂame has hydrogen atoms stripped from 
2 , NH and free N atoms in turn. This effect is most 
it, producing NH 
conspicuous in or immediately downstream of a ﬂame’s reaction 
zone, where [H] >> [H] eq . However, farther downstream, because 
of radicals recombining in reactions (VIII) and (IX), the dominant

More light is cast on this situation by Fig. 40 . This is a plot of 
the total of the individual currents of every positive ion, measured 
at 5 mm downstream of the reaction zone of ﬂame 6 at ∼ 2080 
K, when varying amounts of NH 
3 were added to the gas supplied 
to the burner. For this, a sampling oriﬁce of diameter 120 μm was 
again used. Fig. 40 demonstrates the existence of at least two ion- 
producing processes: one is proportional to the quantity of NH 
3 
added to the ﬂame’s unburned gas; the other is independent of 
how much NH

The spike seen in Fig. 39 , when observing ions in a ﬂame’s re- 
action zone has been attributed to a curiosity of sampling [45] a 
ﬂame on the burner shown in Figs. 5–7 . It looks as if part of the 
reaction zone of these cooler ﬂames, with a much lower burning 
velocity than those in Table 1 , is actually being sucked into the 
sampling oriﬁce. In other words, these relatively cool ﬂames are 
not  sitting  very  tightly  on  the  burner.  It  is  quite  likely  that  the 
sampled gas contains unburned gas from upstream of the reaction 
zone  in  a  mixture  with  gas,  which  has  been  through  a  reaction 
3 is anomalously 
zone. One result is that the concentration of NH 
high in the samples taken from up to almost 3 mm from the face 
of the burner. Certainly, measurements made early in that initial 
region of a cool ﬂame ( < 20 0 0 K) must be treated with caution. 
In  fact,  here  is  a  warning  of  the  diﬃculty  of  sampling  a  region 
of a ﬂame, which moves relatively slowly and has a composition 
changing rapidly in space. This explanation was preferred [45] to 
the alternative of the chromium sampling nozzle generating either 
NH 

+ 
3 or NH 
4  heterogeneously. 
The ratio ( I NH4 + .H2O  / I NH4 + ) was found [45] to rise to a maxi- 
mum at ∼ 3 mm from the burner face, but then fell to a steady 
value in the burned gas region at 9 - 16 mm from the burner. This 
enabled a value for the equilibrium constant of

to  be  derived  from  the  steady  value  of  ( I NH4 + .H2O  / I NH4 + )  in  the 
burned gas and the computed value of [H 
2 O] t . These values of K 29 
are plotted in Fig. 41 against the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce 
for each ﬂame. 

Importantly, here there is a suggestion of a shallow minimum 
in ﬂames 8 and 10. This indicates that equilibrium (XXIX) is just

fast enough to proceed in the supersonic expansion of a sample 
from these ﬂames, as well as during both the cool, external, ther- 
mal boundary layers around the tip of the sampling nozzle and the 
acceleration to M = 1. Nevertheless, the points in Fig. 41 for small 
inlet holes (on the falling parts of the plots in Fig. 41 ) were ex- 
trapolated to an inﬁnite diameter for the sampling oriﬁce. This was 
taken to provide the value of K 29 for choked conditions, with M = 1 
at the entrance to the supersonic expansion. The van’t Hoff plot 
in Fig. 42 of their natural logarithms versus 1/ T t  is a reasonable 
straight line, whose slope indicates (cid:2)H o 
29  = – 88 ± 30 kJ mol –1 
after being adjusted for 300 K. This compares well with the value 
of – 86 kJ mol –1 , measured by mass spectrometry at high pressure 
[200] . These values are strikingly smaller in magnitude than those

In the reaction zone of a hydrocarbon ﬂame, ions are generated 
by reactions (IX) and (XXII). Subsequently, the primary ions, CHO + 
(protonated  CO)  and  C 
2 )  quickly 
transfer  a  proton  to  a  large  variety  of  uncharged  molecules  and 
radicals. This has been investigated in some detail [ 87 , 203 ]. The 
picture is a complex one, because so many different positive ions 
are formed in ﬂames burning a hydrocarbon, but it is clear that 
reactions transferring a proton from one species to another play a 
major rôle. It is thus no surprise that they have been studied in 
a variety of hydrocarbon ﬂames. Below, a few examples of these 
proton-transfer reactions are described, with the aim of discover- 
ing  the  effects  of  sampling  on  them.  The  ﬁrst  involves  the  ions 
produced by adding trace quantities of an alkaline earth, e.g . stron- 
tium, to a ﬂame. In this case, the principal positive ions are typi- 
cally Sr + and SrOH + [ 34 , 55 , 69 , 71 , 72 , 183–187 ]. The free electron is 
again the dominant negatively charged species.

ous solution of 0.025 M BaCl 2 and 0.1 SrAc 2 into ﬁve ﬂames (temperature T f ) of 
H 2 + O 2 + N 2 , sampled through a blunt nozzle based on a tiny electron microscope 
lens of Pt/Ir alloy [204] . The diameter of the oriﬁce was varied as shown [204] . 

Alkaline earths as trace additives 
The study in question was done by Chen and Goodings [204] . 
They introduced simultaneously two different metals into ﬁve, pre- 
mixed, fuel-rich ﬂames of H 
2 . Included in this group of 
metals were the alkaline earths: Ca, Sr, Ba, together with Mg and 
Sn. The major positive ion was of the type SrOH + . These ions were 
typically produced [184–187] by chemi-ionisation in:

Sr + OH → SrOH + + e –

SrO + H → SrOH + + e –

enhanced by the free radicals H and OH having super-equilibrium 
concentrations, particularly in the reaction zone of a ﬂame. By ad- 
justing the concentrations of the two metallic salts in the aqueous 
solution nebulised, it proved possible [204] to bring a pair of pos- 
itive ions into equilibrium in the burnt gas. Thus, Fig. 43 is a plot 
of the logarithm of 
K 30 = ( I BaOH+ / I SrOH+ ) ( [ SrO ] / [ BaO ] ) 

f  for  three  different  diameters  of  a  Goodings’s,  blunt 
versus  1/ T 
sampling nozzle. Thus, the equilibrium constant refers to the re- 
action: 

SrOH + + BaO = SrO + BaOH + , 

(XXX) 

transferring a proton from SrO to BaO. The ratio ( I BaOH +  / I SrOH + ) 
was measured from its observed constant value along the burnt 
gas of each ﬂame, whereas ([SrO]/[BaO]) was computed [204] from 
thermodynamic data and the extent by which the concentrations 
of  H  and  OH  radicals  exceeded  their  values  for  thermodynamic 
equilibrium. The van’t Hoff plot of Fig. 43 is, of course, not a per- 
fect straight line, but it is clear that K 
30 does not display a system- 
atic dependence on the size of the sampling oriﬁce. This means 
30  does not vary much with temperature, i.e . that (cid:2)H 0 
30  is 
that K 
small, so that reaction (XXX) hardly shifts during sampling. Even

so, a best ﬁt line was ﬁtted to the measurements in Fig. 43 . Its 
slope and intercept, respectively, indicated that (cid:2)H 0 
30 = – 10.9 ±
8.8 kJ mol –1  and (cid:2)S 0 
30  = – 13.8 ± 5.9 J mol –1  K –1 . These values 
refer to a mean ﬂame temperature of 2090 K. A problem arising 
from Fig. 43 is that ion hydrates might have been included in the 
estimates of I SrOH + and I BaOH + . Also, with the beneﬁt of hindsight, 
it could be argued that Fig. 43 should be a plot of Log e K 
30 against 
f . A correction for that would not have changed (cid:2)H 0 
1/ T t not 1/ T 
30 
or (cid:2)S 0 
30 . Even so, here is a good example to illustrate the technique 
for analysing ionic equilibria. Of course, other analogous reactions 
were studied, involving the other metals mentioned above. It was 
3 O +  was probably involved in enabling re- 
deduced [204] that H

participation of H 
eﬃcients of the forward and reverse steps of (XXX).

The  fuel-rich  ﬂames  of  C

Table 3 , did not produce soot. They were used above in a study 
of  lithium  [189]  as  an  additive.  However,  they  are  worth  study- 
2 in one of 
ing without an additive. Not all the CO 
these ﬂames, but the presence of such a triatomic molecule, with 
its fairly low value of the ratio of the principal speciﬁc heats, γ , 
tends  to  reduce  a  sample’s  cooling  in  the  supersonic  expansion 
into the ﬁrst vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer. In ad- 
2 spends less time in the supersonic 
dition, a sample containing CO

that equilibria are established for:

Measurements of the apparent equilibrium constant: 

K −2 = 1 / K 2 = ( I CHO + / I H3 O + ) × ( [ H 2 O ] / [ CO ] ) 

along  each  ﬂame  included  I H3O + .H2O  with  that  of  I H3O + .  The  val- 
ues of K –2 became steady downstream in the burnt gases of these 
ﬂames at ∼ 10 mm from the burner. These steady values are plot- 
ted in Fig. 44 against the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce. Now, 
with  the  smaller  oriﬁces,  K –2  ( =  k –2 /  k 2 )  is  small  and  increases 
with the size of the oriﬁce. This means that, as written, reaction 
(–II) is endothermic, so that, if 1/ K –2 ( = K 2 ) had been plotted in 
Fig. 44 the curves would have been similar in shape to some of 
those in e.g . Figs. 31 or 37 . Therefore, there is a sampling perturba- 
tion of equilibrium (–II) in the thermal boundary layer, where in a 
sample, protons were transferred exothermically from CO to H 
2 O in 
the backwards step of (–II). However, no such change of this ionic 
ratio, ( I CHO +  / I H3O + ), manifests itself because of equilibrium (–II) 
shifting during the supersonic expansion, except that for ﬂame 5, 
there is a hint of a maximum in Fig. 44 . All this for ﬂames diluted 
2  suggests that τ eq–2  (the time constant for (–II) shifting 
with CO 
3 O + ) lies between 5 × 10 –7 
in the exothermic direction to form H 
s and 5 × 10 –8  s. Because of the hint of a minimum for ﬂame 5 
in Fig. 44 , τ eq–2 can be estimated to be 5 × 10 –8 s, i.e . at the high 
limit. Approximating τ eq–2 ≈ 1/ ( k –2 [H 
2 O] ∼ 2 × 10 17 
molecule ml −1  yields k –2  to be ∼ 1.0 × 10 –10  molecule –1  ml s −1 . 
This is lower than expected in that Jensen and Jones [193] esti- 
mated it to be ≈ 10 –8 molecule –1 ml s –1 .

to ﬁnd K –2 for an inﬁnitely large sampling hole. The logarithms of 
these extrapolated values were then plotted, as shown in Fig. 45 , 
against  1/ T t .  Such  a  van’t  Hoff plot  can  be  ﬁtted  well  with  a 
straight line. Its slope indicates  (cid:2)H 0 
−2 = – 126 ± 17 kJ mol –1 at an 
average T t = 2034 K; the intercept indicates (cid:2)S 0 
−2 = 5 ± 3 J mo1 –1 
K –1 . Both these values are in excellent agreement with published 
values. For example, the literature value [205] is (cid:2)H 0 
−2 = – 121 kJ 
mol –1 , after correction to 20 0 0 K, i.e . close to the measured value 
of – 126 ± 17 kJ mol –1 . As for the change in entropy, the entropy 
change on the protonation of CO with the proton on the C atom 
is listed [206] as 4.2 J mol –1 K at 298 K; this is close to the value 
indicated here of 5 ± 3 J mol –1 K –1 . Of course, the value of (cid:2)H 0 
−2 
can  be  used  to  derive  the  proton  aﬃnity  of  CO,  if  that  for  H 
2 O 
is known. Taking (cid:2)H 0 
−2 = 121 ±18 kJ mol –1  at 298 K indicates a 
proton aﬃnity for CO of 576 ± 18 kJ mol –1 , which is slightly less 
than 594 ±7 kJ mol –1 listed [ 205 , 206 ]. Here the point is that such 
a quantity can be measured in a ﬂame. In addition, the fact that 
equilibrium (–II) shifts in thermal boundary layers, but not in the 
supersonic expansion, is providing kinetic information on the main 
reaction occurring, when a sample is perturbed.

A study [45] was mentioned above of the ion NH

ing hydration in some ﬂames of H 
2 , described in Table 4 . 
The main features of those ﬂames were that they had low tem- 
2 in 
peratures of 1650–2059 K and large quantities of H 
2 /O 
the unburned gas ranging from 6.0 to 8.6. In that case, H 
2 was both 
the fuel and a diluent. The free radicals H, O and OH always had 
concentrations in the reaction zone exceeding their ﬁnal values for 
equilibrium in the burned gas. It was noted above, in Section 3.3.1 , 
that there is natural ionisation in these hydrogen ﬂames. However, 
with ∼ 0.25 vol. % of ammonia added to the unburned gas, reaction 
(XXVII) was seen to be an additional ion-producing step. Conse- 
+ ions were generated in and near the reaction zone.

Now, the reaction:

will be examined to see whether or not it is equilibrated. 

Fig. 46 shows plots of the ratio: ( I NH4 + + I NH4 + .H2O )/ I H3O + along

sumed  to  be  formed  from  NH

negligible  concentrations  in  these  experiments.  When  increasing

amounts  of  NH

ion currents for NH

Fig. 46 the above ionic ratio peaks markedly in every ﬂame near

of Table 4 , using a sampling oriﬁce 120 μm in diameter and for 0.25 vol. % of NH 3 
added to the unburnt gas. 

Afterwards, the ratio rises to a steady value beyond 10 mm from 
the burner. 

As  a  test  for  whether  reaction  (XXXII)  is  at  equilibrium,  the 
ionic ratio, as measured in ﬂame 6 at 15 mm from the burner, was 
plotted in Fig. 47 against the concentration of NH 
3 in the gas mix- 
ture supplied to the burner. The measurements can be ﬁtted by a 
straight line through the origin, in accord with reaction (XXXII) be- 
ing equilibrated by at least ∼ 10 – 14 mm from the burner. The 
downstream  values  of  ( I NH4 + + I NH4 + .H2O )/  I H3O +  from  Fig.  46  are 
collected for all ﬁve ﬂames in Fig. 48 , as plots versus the diam- 
eter of the sampling oriﬁce. Now these plots show minima, indi- 
cating reaction (XXXII) is exothermic and fast enough to be per- 
turbed in both the thermal boundary layer and the supersonic ex- 
pansion. Thus, it appears that reaction (XXXII) has a time constant, 
τ 32 , less than about 5 × 10 –8 s in these fairly cool ﬂames containing 
2 O], gives 
large quantities of H 
–32 [H 
τ eq32  ≈ 1/(6 × 10 –9 × 6 × 10 17 )  ≈ 2.8 × 10 –10  s,  using  k

10 –9  ml  molecule −1  s −1  from  a  mean  of  k 
–32  ∼ 2.3 × 10 –9  ml 
molecule –1  s –1  [207–209] ,  measured  at  room  temperature,  but 
scaled up to these ﬂame temperatures. This provides a quantita- 
tive explanation for reaction (XXXII) being perturbed in a sample, 
when passing through the thermal boundary layer and also the su- 
personic expansion. The value of τ eq32 < 5 × 10 –8 s means that re- 
action (XXXII) is equilibrated rapidly, when the ﬂame gases leave 
the reaction zone. 

2 . Approximating τ eq32 as ≈ 1/ k 

The curves in Fig. 48 resemble curve D in Fig. 19 . This means 
that extrapolations for each ﬂame of the ionic ratio for small d t to 
a large oriﬁce should yield a similar ionic ratio to that from extrap- 
olating (to d t → 0) the measured ionic ratios for d t larger than that 
for the minimum. The two values of these extrapolated ionic ra- 
tios did agree within experimental error. These extrapolated ionic 
ratios have values corresponding to conditions, when M = 1 at the

throat of the oriﬁce. The resulting values for each ﬂame are plot- 
32 versus 1/ T t . It will be seen that a straight 
ted in Fig. 49 as log e K 
line can  be ﬁtted.  Its  slope gives (cid:2)H 0 
32  =  −148 ± 30  kJ  mol –1 ; 
the  intercept  gives  (cid:2)S 0 
32  =  – 5  ± 4  J  mol –1  K –1  at an  average 
temperature in the throat of 1650 K. When converted to 298 K, 
(cid:2)H 0 
32  = – 173 ± 30 kJ mol –1 , which is ∼ 10 kJ mol –1  less than 
the value of – 163 kJ mol –1 , obtained from listed proton aﬃnities 
[206] . The small value of (cid:2)S 0 
32 is very much as expected, i.e. close 
to zero for reaction (XXXII). It is interesting that the proton aﬃnity 
of NH 

3 is ∼ 163 to 173 kJ mol –1 higher than that of H 

2 O. 

3.4.4. Equilibria for Mn and the alkaline earths as additives 

The elements Mn and the alkaline earths, when added in trace 
quantities  to  a  ﬂame,  produce  measurable  amounts  of  the  ions 
typiﬁed by SrOH + and Sr + [ 34 , 55 , 179 , 183–187 ]. In fact, they have 
been conﬁrmed [186] to have their concentrations coupled by the 
exothermic reaction: 

SrOH + + H = Sr + + H 2 O

to the burner. 

being fast enough to be at equilibrium in a ﬂame. Consequently, 
if equilibrium (XXXIII) were perturbed during sampling, the shift 
would produce more Sr +  ions from SrOH + . All this is consistent 
with reaction (XXI) being suﬃciently rapid to be equilibrated for 
all the alkali metals [ 70 , 130 ], each of which is iso-electronic with 
a positive ion of an element from Group 2 of the Periodic Table. 
In fact, reaction (XXI) has been used [70] to measure the falling 
concentrations of free atoms of hydrogen, whilst they recombine 
in reactions (VII) and (VIII) along e.g . ﬂames of H 

2 + O 

2 .

ﬁnal steady value of I BaOH + / I Ba + , assuming that the ratio [H 
2 O]/[H] 
for equilibrium in the ﬂame is not altered by sampling and so is 
that for equilibrium in the burnt gas. In fact, Fig. 51 indicates that 
K 33 = 0.362.  According  to  Jensen  and  Jones’  expression  [210]  for 
K 33 , such a value of 0.362 corresponds to reaction (XXXIII) for bar- 
ium freezing at 1493 ± 120 K. This situation can be compared with 
the hydration of BaOH + . Fig. 51 presents the ratio I BaOH + / I BaOH + . H2O 
from the proﬁles in Fig. 50 . By a similar analysis, this ratio indi- 
cates [179] that the monohydration BaOH + froze at 1319 K, i.e . at 
≈ 174 K below when reaction (XXXIII) froze for the main ions of 
barium. Consideration [179] of this ﬂame indicated an aerodynamic 
cooling of ≈ 376 K to reach M = 1. In addition, Fig. 26 indicates a 
sample was cooled by ≈ 420 K in the thermal boundary layer, so 
the temperature at the throat of the oriﬁce ( i.e . at the start of the 
expansion) was roughly 2360 – (420 + 376) = 1564 K. This indicates 
that reaction (XXXIII), which froze at 1493 ± 120 K, did so prob- 
ably in the neck of the oriﬁce or very early indeed in the super- 
sonic expansion. If reaction (XXXIII) actually froze, when a sample 
attained a Mach number of unity, i.e . before the supersonic expan- 
sion, the linearity of the plot of I BaOH + / I Ba + in Fig. 51 would then 
have a basis and explanation. This thus appears likely. 

Of course, the diagnostic test is to measure an apparent value 
of K 33  for different diameters of the sampling hole. Alas, for the 
alkaline earths this appears to have only been done once [140] in 
a rather limited way. Fig. 52 shows plots [140] of ( I Sr + / I SrOH + ), 
measured  [140]  at  25  mm  downstream  of  the  reaction  zone  of 
f  = 2330 K) and the other fuel-lean ( T 
two ﬂames, one fuel-rich ( T 
f 
= 2414 K). The shapes of both plots are quite unusual. The even- 
tual increases for both plots show evidence of perturbations in the 
supersonic expansions, but neither of them indicates a sampling 
distortion in the external thermal boundary layers. Even so, in both 
cases there could well be a perturbation during the sample’s accel- 
eration to the speed of sound in the throat of the oriﬁce, as hinted 
by the consistent linearity of I BaOH + / I Ba +  in Fig. 51 , with d t = 143 
μm. 

The  only  other  case  of  a  related  metal  having  been  investi- 
gated  with  differently  sized  oriﬁces  is  Mn  [211] ,  whose  neutral 
species are free atoms of Mn and molecules of MnO in the ratio 
[Mn]/[MnO] ∼ 3 [211] . The next most abundant species is MnOH, 
constituting  ∼ 1  %  of  the  manganese  present.  That  work  estab- 
lished that reaction (XXXIII) for manganese, i.e. : 

MnOH + + H = Mn + + H 2 O

was equilibrated in a ﬂame of H

was hotter than 2100 K. This was done by measuring [211] the ra- 
tio of the currents of the ions Mn +  and MnOH +  [211] along e.g . 
2 + O 
ﬂame 1 (of H 
2 ) described in Table 1 . Fig. 53 shows that 
without C 
2 added to the burner supplies, the ratio goes through 
2 H 
a maximum at ∼ 7 mm downstream of the reaction zone. In this 
case, the ions MnOH + are generated by the chemi-ionisation reac- 
tions:

Mn + OH → MnOH + + e –

MnO + H → MnOH + + e –

(XXXVI) 

by  analogy  with  the  alkaline  earths  [ 55 , 124 , 185 ].  Subsequently, 
Mn + ions are formed in reaction (XXXIV). In Fig. 53 , it can be seen 
that with 0.5 and 1.0 vol. % of C 
2 in the ﬂame’s unburned gas, 
2 H 
the ionic ratio’s maximum value progressively increased closer to 
the  reaction  zone.  The  effect  of  adding  C 
2  is  for  the  Calcote- 
Sugden mechanism of reactions (IX) and (II) to generate ions of 
3 O + , which react with the major neutral species Mn or MnO in:

Ba(OH) 
actually falls to become almost comparable with its noise. Other- 
wise, BaOH + and its monohydrate grow to reach steady concentra- 
tions, downstream in the burned gas. 

Fig. 51 gives proﬁles of I BaOH + / I Ba +  along the ﬂame of Fig. 50 . 
This ionic ratio increases almost tenfold, but then becomes fairly 
constant at 145 ± 20. The linear rise in the ratio is in line with 
H atoms, from the pool of radicals, H, OH and free O atoms, dis- 
appearing  along  the  burnt  gas  and  the  analogue  of  equilibrium 
(XXXIII) for barium consequently adjusting, so that the initial lin- 
earity in Fig. 51 corresponds to a second-order recombination plot 
of  free  atoms  of  hydrogen.  This  striking  linearity  has  been  also 
found  with  calcium,  strontium  [186]  or  manganese  (see  below) 
added to a ﬂame of H 
2 . It suggests that for all these metals, 
reaction (XXXIII) freezes in the sampling system at a point, which 
does  not  change  signiﬁcantly  when  sampling  at  different  points 
along a ﬂame. There now follows a discussion as to whether that 
freezing might be at the entrance to the sampling oriﬁce?

Jensen  and  Jones  [210]  have  concluded  that  the  equilibrium 
constant K 33 = ( I Ba + / I BaOH + ) × ([H

(4400/ T ). Fig. 51 enables the value of K 33 to be estimated from the

addition, MnOH + might disappear, giving Mn + and H

via reaction (XXXIV) being equilibrated. It is clear that adding more 
2 in Fig. 53 increases the ratio, I Mn + / I MnOH + early in the ﬂame.

A scaled value of γ
H ( = [H]/[H] eq ) is also plotted in Fig. 53 to co- 
incide with I Mn + / I MnOH + at 20 mm, where, in fact, all these curves 
have the same value. Thus, the ratio I Mn + / I MnOH + eventually follows 
or mirrors γ
H , as noted for the analogous ions of Ba in Fig. 51 . 
After the maxima in Fig. 53 , the pair of coupled ions, Mn +  and 
MnOH + , disappears by recombining with free electrons in both the 
two- and three-body steps [201] : 

MnOH + + e – → Mn + OH or MnO + H, 

Mn + + e – + M → Mn + M.

In Fig. 53 , it is conspicuous that I Mn +  always exceeds I MnOH + . 
This contrasts with the alkaline earths, for which the atomic ion is 
less abundant than the molecular ion. 

Extensive study of the ratio I Mn + / I MnOH + revealed [211] that its 
value did not vary with the diameter of the chromium, sampling 
oriﬁce. This was true irrespective of the ﬂame burned. This impor- 
tant observation indicates that no falsiﬁcation of the ionic ratio oc- 
curred by an exothermic chemical reaction (such as (XXXIV)) pro- 
ceeding, whilst a sample passed from a ﬂame into the mass spec- 
trometer. This is investigated further in Fig. 54 . For this, the ratio 
of the two ions at 20 mm, e.g . from Fig. 53 , was converted into the 
equilibrium constant, K 34 = ( I Mn + / I MnOH + ) × ([H 
2 O]/[H]). The results 
are shown in Fig. 54 as a van’t Hoff plot of log e K 34 versus (1/ T 
f ), 
rather than (1/ T t ). 

Fig. 54 reveals that a state of equilibrium for reaction (XXXIV) is 
very likely at 20 mm downstream of the reaction zone, but only for 

A.N. Hayhurst

it might be expected to be more like Mg than the true alkaline 
earths. One interesting difference here is that Goodings’s group de- 
cided [146] that the inter-conversion of Mg + and MgOH + involves 
a three-body association of Mg + and OH with a third body, rather 
than the two-body reaction of Mg +  with a molecule of water, as 
in the reverse of (XXXIV). This apparently conforms with Sugden’s 
criterion [198] that for the reaction (converting Mg + to MgOH + ) to 
be bimolecular (two-body), the dissociation energy Mg + – OH has 
to be larger than a critical value. 

4. Sampling negative ions in ﬂames 

4.1. General observations of negative ions

ﬂames hotter than 2100 K. The linear region in Fig. 54 for ﬂames 
hotter than 2100 K indicates that, because K 34 = exp ( (cid:2)S 0 
34 /R ).exp 
34 /RT ) , (cid:2)H o 
( −(cid:2)H o 
34 = – 233 ± 25 kJ mol –1 at ﬂame temperatures. 
This value of (cid:2)H o 
34 , together with the dissociation energy for Mn–
OH of 305 ± 13 kJ mol –1 [69] , suggests that the ionisation energy 
for MnOH is 763 ± 35 kJ mol –1 (7.91 ± 0.36 eV). For comparison, 
the ionisation energies of MgOH, CaOH and SrOH [69] are, respec- 
tively, 743 ± 63, 557 ± 63 and 520 ± 63 kJ mol –1 . The above ex- 
pression for K 34 means that (cid:2)S 0 
34 = – 18 ± 4 J K –1 mol –1 , which is 
an appropriately low value for reaction (XXXIV), whose reactants 
and products include only a triatomic and monatomic species. 

The explanation for reaction (XXXIV) not coming close to equi- 
librium in a ﬂame cooler than 2100 K appears to be a kinetic re- 
striction. In fact, Fig. 53 revealed that the time constant for reac- 
tion (XXXIV) attaining equilibrium must be τ eq34 ≈ 0.5 ms, given 
that the axial velocity of the burnt gas is here 25 m s –1 . Such a 
value of τ eq34 is well in excess of the threshold of 0.5 μs, needed 
for  any  reaction  to  be  fast  enough  to  occur  during  sampling.  It 
was noted above that reaction (XXXIV) is exothermic; this indicates 
that its forward step: MnOH + + H → Mn + + H 
2 O has an appreciable 
activation energy. Further consideration [211] of the kinetics of this 
reaction corroborated such an interpretation. In that case, no sam- 
pling perturbation was occurring, as was conﬁrmed by measure- 
ments of I Mn + / I MnOH + being insensitive to changes in the diameter 
of the sampling oriﬁce. 

This  conclusion  about  reaction  (XXXIV)  compares  with  the 
above conﬁrmation in Fig. 51 that the analogous reaction for bar- 
ium did shift in the thermal boundary layer around the tip of a 
“blunt” sampling nozzle. The shift was to convert BaOH + ions into 
Ba + , so as written, reaction (XXXIV) is exothermic for barium. In 
fact, the reaction for barium appeared to freeze at ≈ 1493 K for a 
ﬂame, whose burnt gas was at 2360 K. Without any cooling in the 
boundary layer, a sample’s temperature would fall to 1984 K at the 
oriﬁce’s throat. As for Ca and Sr, it seems that reaction (XXXIV) for 
these alkaline earths is also exothermic [ 69 , 185 , 186 ] and freezes, 
so  that  the  ratio  I Sr + / I SrOH +  can  be  used  to  monitor  the  recom- 
2  and  O 
bination  of  the  radicals  H  and  OH  along  a  ﬂame  of  H 
2 
[186] . Even so, that manganese is quite different, makes it impor- 
tant that a detailed comparative study is initiated of the thermody- 
namics and freezing of reactions (XXXIII) and (XXXIV), at least for 
the sequence Mg to Ba, using differently sized sampling oriﬁces. 
The metal Be does not appear to have been studied in a ﬂame; 

So  far,  the  focus  of  this  review  has  been  on  positive  ions  in 
ﬂames, their identities, equilibria and whether or not their reac- 
tions are quenched during sampling. In experimental work on pos- 
itive ions, the major negatively charged entity was usually the free 
electron,  but  sometimes  there  were  small  quantities  of  negative 
ions present, especially when a hydrocarbon was the fuel. Negative 
ions in a ﬂame are easily studied by reversing the polarities of all 
the accelerating potentials inside the mass spectrometer. There are 
several examples of deliberate studies of negative ions in undoped 
ﬂames [ e.g . 58,59,62,67,80,84,108,166,196,203], with some workers 
trying to identify the neutral species on which each negative ion 
was  based.  In  this  connexion,  whereas  a  positive  ion,  RH + ,  nor- 
mally reﬂects the existence of the uncharged species, R, to which 
a proton has been subsequently attached, a negative ion, R –, of- 
ten denotes the presence of the neutral entity, RH [58] . The reason 
for negative ions behaving this way will become apparent below.

Thus, the ions, C

2 H 
4 + O 

However, it all turns out to be somewhat more complicated, be- 
cause negative ions can be formed and removed in many different 
ways. One possibility [ 58 , 212 , 213 ] is that free electrons attach to a 
stable molecule in e.g. 

e – + O 2 + M → O 2 – + M 

e – + H 2 O → OH – + H 

e – + HO 2 → O 2 – + H.

According to the last two reactions, the negative ions OH – and 
2 , whose presence 
O 
is manifested by these negative ions. In addition, negative ions can 
be produced [58] by electron-transfer in e.g. 

2 O and HO 

O 2 – + OH → OH – + O 2 . 

(XLIV) 

2 + O 

In general, the ratio of the concentrations of OH – and O 

2 – in 
e.g . a fuel-lean ﬂame of H 
2 is perturbed by free electrons be- 
ing lost to the metallic sampling cone, in addition to a sample be- 
ing cooled in one or more of the three standard ways. Thus, the 
steady-state concentrations of these ions are perturbed. In fact, de- 
tailed considerations of the perturbations [58] have enabled values 
for the rate constants for the forward and reverse steps in reac- 
tions (XLI) - (XLIV) to be deduced. 

These  reactions  (XLI)  -  (XLIV)  mean  that  the  natural  con- 
stituents of a ﬂame do form negative ions, which actually can in- 
teract with those formed by additives. In that context, some nega- 
tive ions result from free electrons attaching dissociatively to stable 
molecules [ 59 , 212–215 ] in: 

e – + HCl → Cl – + H, 

(XLV) 

40

which is an analogue of (XLII) and (XLIII). All these reactions show 
why  the  negative  ion  R – indicates  the  presence  of  the  neutral 
species RH. Some of the complexities of how negative ions form 
in the simplest of lean ﬂames of H 
2 have been described and 
discussed [212] . Occasionally, novel reactions have been found pro- 
ducing negative ions in ﬂames doped with an alkali metal and a 
halogen in processes typiﬁed by [213–215] : 

2 + O 

K + Cl → K + + Cl –

NaBr + M → Na + + Br – + M ‘ 

(XLVI) 

(XLVII) 

Perhaps  most  work  on  negative  ions  in  ﬂames  has  been  de- 
voted to the quest for the most stable of them, which also might 
be suitable for safely reducing the concentrations of free electrons, 
particularly in the exhausts of rockets or aircraft. Often a labora- 
tory ﬂame was seeded with an easily ionised alkali metal, e.g. cae- 
sium, and a second additive hopefully mopped up the free elec- 
trons [ 80 , 82 , 216–218 ]. Negative ions were identiﬁed by mass spec- 
trometric sampling. Most of these early experiments have been re- 
viewed [ 62 , 69 , 82 , 120 , 172 , 219 ]. 

Originally, halogens were added either directly or as a volatile 
compound  to  a  ﬂame’s  unburnt  gases;  the  electron  concentra- 
tion along the burned gas was measured with a microwave device 
[ 213 , 214 ]. Those early studies established that for a halogen, X, the 
rapid equilibrium 
−
− + H (cid:2) HX + e 

(XLVIII) 

X 

was fast enough to be established early in the burnt gas of a ﬂame 
[ 213 , 214 ]. In fact, totally surprisingly, when a halogen was gradu- 
ally added to a ﬂame seeded with an alkali metal, A, the electron 
concentration in the ﬂame rose to levels exceeding that for ther- 
mal ionisation in: 

A = A + + e –. 

(XLIX) 

The explanation was that the halogen, X, introduced a new way 

of generating ions, i.e . 

A + X = A + + X –. 

(L) 

Reaction (L), when added algebraically to reaction (XLVIII) and 

attains a steady-state concentration, whereby the overall rates of 
formation and removal of a negative ion become equal. Such an 
occurrence  of  a  steady  state  is  usual  for  negative  ions  generally 
and makes them different from positive ions. Inevitably, these bal- 
ances are governed by a ﬂame’s free radicals H, OH and O hav- 
ing super-equilibrium concentrations [ 70 , 71 , 130 ]. Such a situation 
enhances  the  rates  of  reactions  like  (XLIV),  (XLVIII)  and  (LI).  In 
addition, these steady states might be shifted by a sample being 
cooled in the boundary layer, during the supersonic expansion and 
the acceleration to a Mach number of unity, when a sample is in 
the throat of a sampling oriﬁce. One important extra complication 
arises here, because of free electrons being lost from a sample to 
the metal around the sampling oriﬁce, as discussed below.

It  is  clear  that  several  negative  ions  have  been  observed  in 
hydrocarbon ﬂames, without ever having been ascribed chemical 
formulae. In fact, 21 such unidentiﬁed negative ions with masses 
below  100  have  been  found  in  ﬂames  of  C 
2  [196] . 
Other examples of mysterious negative ions have been documented 
[ 108 , 232 ].  One  worth  following  up  is  Knewstubb’s  observation 
[232]  of  several  negative  ions  in  the  preheat  region,  just  before 
the  reaction  zone  of  a  premixed  hydrocarbon/oxygen  ﬂame.  An- 
other interesting curiosity arose from observing the positive and 
2 + Ar, with 
negative ions in a series of fuel-rich ﬂames of C 
an atomic ratio C/O of up to 1.09 [ 66 , 67 ]. All of them had temper- 
atures of ∼ 2300 K in their burned gas. These small ﬂames were 
burned on a simple, quartz tube (i.d. 2.5 mm) and looked like a 
ﬂame on a Bunsen burner. This enabled ions before and after the 
reaction zone to be observed [66] . Some results from the richest 
ﬂame studied are shown in  Fig. 55 [ 66 , 233 ]. This ﬂame showed 
the yellow emission characteristic of soot, starting 3 mm down- 
stream of the tip of the reaction zone. Immediately after the re- 
action zone and up to where soot appeared, there was the well- 
known  [131]  bluish-grey  region  called  a  “feather”.  Spectroscopic 
studies of this region have revealed the presence of intermediates 

2 + O 

2 H 

This  means  that  whenever  hydrogen  atoms  have  concentra- 
tions exceeding their values for thermodynamic equilibrium, super- 
equilibrium quantities of free electrons can appear [ 212 , 213 ]. It is 
usually the case, particularly for ﬂames of H 
2 , that hydrogen 
atoms are present in amounts higher than those for equilibrium 
[ 70 , 71 , 130 ]. The equilibrium (XLVIII) coupling the concentrations of 
halogen ions, X –, with those of the stable acid, HX, will be referred 
to again below. This is because (XLVIII) is one of a very small num- 
ber of balanced reactions ( i.e . opposing rates of reaction equal one 
another) to have been studied mass spectrometrically in ﬂames by 
varying the size of the sampling oriﬁce. This omission limits most 
past work on negative ions in ﬂames.

What then has been done experimentally on negative ions in 
ﬂames? The halogens have already been mentioned. Group 6 of the 
Periodic Table contains the elements O and S. Oxygen-rich ﬂames

Fig. 55.  Axial plots of the total of the ion currents (positives in the upper part, negatives in the lower) measured at points along a sooting ﬂame of C 2 H 2 + O 2 + Ar [233] . 
The atomic ratio was C/O ∼ 1.09; the temperature ∼ 2300 K. Method A gave the sum of the individual currents of ions with masses up to 170 a.m.u. With method B, the 
quadrupole rods had no d.c. components, so the measured ion current was of ions with masses from zero up to inﬁnity. The positive and negative ions were detected with 
slightly different sensitivities. The turquoise reaction zone is denoted by rz. The feather (see text), burnt gas and visibly sooting regions are shown. The velocity in the burnt 
gas was ∼ 4.4 m/s. 

2 , C 

like C 
3 and CH [234] . Total concentrations of either positive or 
negative ions were assessed in two ways [66] . Method A summed 
all  the  individual  ion  currents  of  one  sign  up  to  a  mass  of  170 
a.m.u. Method B measured one current for all the positive ions and 
another for all the negatives, by removing the d.c. components on 
the voltages supplied to the quadrupole rods. This meant that such 
a current was of all the ions of one sign with masses up to inﬁn- 
ity. The difference between the two methods gives the sum of the 
currents for every ion heavier than 170 a.m.u. 

The upper part of Fig. 55 shows that the two methods of ex- 
amining the positive ions had large differences, caused by positive 
ions with masses above 170 a.m.u. They ﬁrst appeared in the reac- 
tion zone and then more were produced in a second jump at 1.5 
to 3 mm. This was just before the yellow emission from soot par- 
ticles appeared at 3 mm, after which there was a pause in the net 
rate of production of these big positive ions. Then after ∼ 6 mm, 
there was a steady growth in the number of what must be heavy 
positive ions. This lasted until a plateau was reached at 20 mm 
from the reaction zone. As for the negative ions in the lower part 
of Fig. 53 , they at ﬁrst reﬂected the axial proﬁles of the positive 
ions, suggesting the formation of negative ions heavier than 170 
a.m.u. immediately after the reaction zone. Also, it seems that the 
concentrations of free electrons are relatively small, having been 
mopped up to form negative ions in such a fuel-rich ﬂame. How- 
ever, next at ∼ 4 mm from the reaction zone ( i.e . after a residence 
time  of  ∼ 1  ms)  the  total  current  of  heavy  negative  ions  from 
method B suddenly declined. In fact, the signal turned negative at 

6 mm and remained negative throughout the rest of the burnt gas. 
This was a reproducible observation [66] . 

The only rational explanation [66] for observing negative con- 
centrations of heavy negative ions in Fig. 55 is that suddenly at 
4 mm, more heavy positive ions were produced than large neg- 
atively  charged  ones.  Also,  after  4  mm  there  were  positive  ions 
heavy enough to overcome a repelling voltage on the quadrupole 
housing, set in this case at the unusually low value of 60 V. They 
were accordingly detected along with the negative ions and so re- 
duced method B’s signal for negative ions. In other words, when 
counting  negative  ions  with  method  B,  if  the  kinetic  energy  of 
these huge, positive, super-ions approaching the second chamber 
exceeded e (cid:10) ( e is the electronic charge, (cid:10) is the repelling voltage 
on the second chamber), positive, super-ions would pass through 
the assembly of quadrupole rods and be detected in the Faraday 
cup. There they offset the current of negative ions to result in the 
measured current going negative. Simple estimates of the termi- 
nal velocity of the ions entering the second chamber indicate that 
only ions heavier than 10 4 a.m.u. will qualify as a super-ion. This 
means that  those  observed in  Fig.  55  are  much  bigger  than  C 
60 
at 720 a.m.u.; in fact, the super-ions appeared after ∼ 1 ms (a long 
time in terms of molecular events) in this particular ﬂame. Altering 
the voltage on the second vacuum chamber conﬁrmed this inter- 
pretation. Of course, positive ions with masses up to 10 7 a.m.u. are 
known in sooting ﬂames [ 22 , 235–237 ] and one possibility is that 
uncharged carbon spheres larger than ∼ 20 0 0 a.m.u. ionise ther- 
mally [ 235 , 238 ]. Of course, the ﬂame used in Fig. 55 was fuel-rich,

so that that there was combustion of excess fuel in the surround- 
ing air. The effects of such after-burning are clear from Fig. 55 by 
the second maximum in the positive ions, registered by method A. 
This occurred ∼ 10 mm downstream of the reaction zone of this 
unusually narrow ﬂame. One interesting aspect of these observa- 
tions is that the rôle of ions in the production of soot has been ar- 
gued for years [ 62 , 92–94 , 97 , 98 , 131 , 172 , 235 ]; doubtless mass spec- 
trometry will continue to contribute to that debate. 

4.3. Halide ions; kinetics of their disappearance 

2 + O 

2 + N 

The formation and sampling of the ions Cl –, Br – and I – have 
been investigated [59] in the  fuel-rich ﬂames  of  H 
2  in 
Table  1 ,  using  the  mass  spectrometer  and  burner,  illustrated  in 
Figs.  4–7 .  Typically  a  ﬂame  was  seeded  with  CsCl  by  nebulising 
aqueous CsCl into the ﬂame’s gas supplies. Very early in the ﬂame, 
this produces free atoms of Cs, which ionise in a version of re- 
action (VII) or (XII), as noted above in Figs. 8 and 9 . In addition, 
halogens were often added by saturating part of the diluent, sup- 
plied to the burner, with a volatile organic halide, e.g . CCl 
3 , 
n-C

ature  below  that  of  the  laboratory  to  avoid  condensation  of  the

Fig. 56 [59] shows ion proﬁles along ﬂame 1 (with burned gas 
at 2400 K), when sampled with a nickel nozzle using an oriﬁce 
0.15 mm in diameter. Aqueous CsCl was nebulised, but no extra 
halogen was added. This ensured that the total concentration of 
all the species of Cs equalled the sum of all those containing Cl. 
The mole fraction of both was 1.4 × 10 –7 , so they really are trace 
species. The current for Cs + reaches what looks like an equilibrium 
value (probably representing 100 % ionisation) at ∼ 10 mm from 
the reaction zone. The current for Cl – increases from a very low 
value to a steady level after ∼ 30 mm. Throughout the burned gas, 
the current for Cl – is much lower than that for Cs + , (by at least 
four orders of magnitude), especially so, near the ﬂame’s reaction 
zone. 

To assess Fig. 56 , for which the ion spectrum is dominated by 
two ions: Cs + and Cl –, with [Cs + ] = [e –] + [Cl –], the following reac- 
tions are relevant [213] for a general halogen, X:

(LI) 

Both  reactions  were  discussed  above  as  being  known  to  be 
equilibrated, e.g . at ∼ 2400 K for Fig. 56 . Furthermore, their equi- 
librium constants are well known [ 59 , 193 ], so that using the mea- 
sured ion currents, together with known values of γ
H = [H] / [H] eq , 
it is possible to calculate the value of α, the ratio of the expected 
concentration of X – (for both (XLVIII) and (LI) equilibrated) at the 
point  of  sampling  to  that  actually  measured  there.  Such  a  deﬁ- 
nition  of  α means  that  a  larger  α indicates  that  more  X – ions 
have been “lost” from the sample. In that context, reaction (XLVIII), 
as  written  [59] ,  is  exothermic  for  chlorine.  This  means  that  if  a 
sample from a ﬂame were to be cooled during sampling, one re- 
sult  could  be  that  reaction  (XLVIII)  shifts,  so  that  Cl – ions  were 
lost from a sample and α increased above unity. There might be 
other ways of losing Cl – ions from a sample, such as free electrons 
leaving the sample, but the possibility that reaction (XLVIII) shifts 
(when a sample is cooled) merits further examination. 

Fig. 57 presents some values of α derived [59] , when chlorine 
3  to ﬂame 1, but without any alkali metal. In 
was added as CHCl 
3 O + (created mainly from 
that case, the major positive ion was H 
3 ), with Cl – and free electrons as the 
CH radicals on adding CHCl 
negatively  charged  entities.  The  values  of α in  Fig.  57  are  for  a 
range of sampling hole diameters in nickel nozzles, as well as for 
different  amounts  of  chlorine  in  the  burned  gas.  The  measure- 
ments  were  made  10  mm  downstream  of  the  reaction  zone  of 
ﬂame 1. The values of α always exceed unity, indicating that some 
Cl – ions were “lost”. 

Very strikingly, α in Fig. 57 displays a minimum with respect to 
the nozzle diameter. Also, α becomes almost linear with large sam- 
pling holes. This is shown by the broken line, which refers to 0.7 
% of chlorine present. This broken line extrapolates back for d t → 0 
to indicate α → 1, i.e . the actual current for Cl – was then the cor- 
rect one. Here is an important clue as to how negative ions might 
be best measured. Thus, if one were to encounter a major ion, Y –, 
formed by an additive, one might well need to measure the ratio: 
{the sum of the ion currents of every positive ion / the current of 
Y –} to estimate the stability of the ion, Y –. One approach would be 

A.N. Hayhurst 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 88 (2022) 100927 

to measure that ratio for different, large diameters of the sampling 
oriﬁce. Then, an extrapolation of that ratio to d t → 0 would yield 
the ratio’s value for conditions in the throat of the oriﬁce, as well 
as the ratio [Y –] / [e –] in the oriﬁce’s throat. 

That there is a minimum in Fig. 57 is redolent of similar plots 
for positive ions, e.g . Figs. 16 , 37 , 41 and 48 . Here then is another 
strong  indication  that  some  Cl – ions  have  gone  undetected,  be- 
cause  of  a  sampling  perturbation,  principally  because  of  X – dis- 
appearing via (XLVIII), when a sample was cooled. When the in- 
let oriﬁce was small, this was caused probably by cooling in the 
external boundary layer, as well as by “aerodynamic cooling”. Oth- 
erwise, for larger holes ( d t  > 0.13 mm), cooling occurred in the 
supersonic expansion and by the sample accelerating to a Mach 
number  of  unity  in  the  neck  of  the  oriﬁce.  From  Fig.  57  it  ap- 
pears that holes larger than 0.15 mm are in the second category 
of being large enough to provide no signiﬁcant cooling in the ex- 
ternal boundary layer. With the minima in α occurring in Fig. 57 at 
roughly  d t = 0.06  mm,  it  appears  that  then  the  mean  residence 
times of a sample in the boundary layer and the supersonic ex- 
pansion are then approximately equal. A similar conclusion was ar- 
rived at above for positive ions on examining the minima in Fig. 16 . 
Of course, the positions of these minima depend on which ﬂame 
was sampled. Nevertheless, as far as Fig. 16 is concerned, the resi- 
dence time in the supersonic expansion with d t ∼ 0.06 mm was ≈
0.5 μs. Thus, Fig. 57 with minima at similar d t , conﬁrms the above 
rule  of  thumb,  viz .  that  for  an  equilibrium  to  shift  in  a  sample 
before entering a supersonic expansion requires it to have a time 
constant of ≈ 0.5 μs or less. Of course, strictly speaking, the exact 
critical timing depends on several factors, such as d t , the composi- 
tion, velocity and temperature of the ﬂame . 

Cl – was lowest, because γ

Conﬁrmation, that free atoms of hydrogen destroy negative ions 
in  H + Cl – → e – + HCl  and  thereby  shift  the  exothermic  reaction 
(XLVIII), when the sample’s temperature falls, came from α being 
always  larger  (in  Fig.  57 )  nearer  a  ﬂame’s  reaction  zone,  where 
γ
H  was  bigger.  This  is  evident  in  Fig.  56  where  initially  in  the 
H  was largest just after the re- 
ﬂame I 
action zone. In addition, α was larger in richer ﬂames of H 
2 and 
was bigger in H 
2 . It is notable that 
2 ﬂames than in those of C 
Fig. 57 is the only known investigation to date, using a range of 
d t , to establish whether a negative ion has been lost by a sam- 
pling perturbation. It is more than likely that other negative ions 
have been likewise lost in previous studies [ 80 , 82 , 88 , 217–231 ] of 
exothermic reactions detaching electrons associatively in, e.g .: 

2 H 

H + BO 2 – → e – + HBO 2 , 

H + CrO 3 – → e – + HCrO 3 , 

H + HWO 4 – → e – + H 2 WO 4 , 

H + HMoO 4 – → e – + H 2 MoO 4 . 

Here the free electrons thereby liberated in the supersonic ex- 
pansion,  most  probably  diffused  to  the  metallic  nozzle.  Such  a 
picture also applies to the sampling of other negative ions, such 
as  Br –.  A  new  systematic  study  is  merited,  whereby  e.g .  cae- 
sium and an electron scavenger are added to a range of ﬂames, 
which  should  be  sampled  using  a  range  of  sampling  oriﬁce  di- 
ameters, d t . This is mentioned again below in the context of ap- 
plying  a  voltage  between  the  burner  and  the  sampling  nozzle. 
Some important studies have already been made by Goodings et al. 
[88,216,230,231,239] . 

The two dotted curves in Fig. 57 give values computed [59] for 
α at the end of supersonic expansions for a range of oriﬁce diame- 
2 as diluent, a mole fraction 
ters. These curves happened to be for N 
of H atoms = 0.007, a rate constant for the detachment of electrons

from Cl – in (XLVIII) = k 
0.2 or 1.0 vol. % of chlorine added. The step-by-step computations 
throughout an expansion have been described in detail [59] . They 
assumed that the adiabatic expansion is one-dimensional, an as- 
sumption conﬁrmed by detailed two-dimensional computations for 
3 O + [ 133 , 134 ]. Also, reaction (XLVIII) was taken 
the hydration of H 
to be not exactly at equilibrium in the throat of the nozzle, i.e. at 
the start of the expansion. It turned out that the computations of 
ﬁnal values of α for Cl – were not very sensitive to the rate con- 
stants  of  reaction  (LI),  but  that  was  not  at  all  the  case  for  Br –
and I – [59] . The agreement between modelling and experiment is 
best in Fig. 57 , when the loading of Cl was almost 1 mole % in 
the burnt gas. These computations provided one best-ﬁt value of 
48 = 7 × 10 –10 ml molecule –1 s –1 for Cl, without 
the rate constant, k 
any dependence on temperature for such an exothermic reaction 
without an activation energy. The corresponding values for Br and 
48 = 8 × 10 –10  and 10 × 10 –10  ml molecule –1 
I were, respectively, k 
s –1 [59] . The errors are likely to be less than 50 %. This was signif- 
icantly smaller than the uncertainty on the literature value of k 
48 
before  that  study  [59]  began.  In  fact,  these  rate  constants  agree 
[240–243]  with more recent  measurements.  Such estimates of a 
rate constant from studying a sampling perturbation are a notable 
48 for Cl – indicates 
success of that work. Interestingly, the value of k 
an estimated time constant for the reaction under ﬂame conditions 
of τ eq 48 = 6.7 × 10 –8 s. This is comparable to the approximate crit- 
ical value of ≈ 5 × 10 –8 s, deduced above for an equilibrated reac- 
tion to be shifted in the supersonic expansion. This reveals the lack 
of precision of these rules of thumb, because of the wide variabil- 
ity of the composition, and temperature, etc of ﬂames generally. 
It is worth noting that the backward direction of reaction (XLVIII), 
forming negative ions by dissociative attachment of an electron, is 
exothermic for chlorine and bromine, but is endothermic for io- 
dine. This alone would make iodine unsuitable as an electron scav- 
enger in a cooling exhaust plume (fuel-rich) of a rocket or aircraft 
engine. 

4.4. Do free electrons pass through a sampling oriﬁce ? 

To answer this question it has to be realised that a quadrupole 
mass spectrometer  is  not normally  designed to  detect  free elec- 
trons.  This  is  because  the  instrument’s  useful  mass  range  is  set 
typically from ∼ 4 to 200 a.m.u. Fig. 58 shows the sampling sys- 
tem described above, after being modiﬁed to accommodate a very 
pointed brass needle, held by P.T.F.E. supports to isolate it electri- 
cally [64] . The tip of the needle collector was ∼ 1 mm behind the 
oriﬁce. The idea was to sample a ﬂame as usual at atmospheric 
pressure,  but  to  collect  on  the  needle  those  charged  species  of 
only  one  sign,  i.e .  either  positively  or  negatively  charged,  which 
had gone through the inlet hole and entered the supersonic expan- 
sion. The quadrupole was accordingly not used. The water-cooled 
front  plate  housing  the  sampling  nozzle  (usually  chromium,  but 
here nickel) was earthed electrically. A voltage, V n , of up to ± 36 V 
was imposed on the needle. It ensured that all the charged species 
of one sign, which had entered the expansion, were collected; their 
current was measured by an electrometer, which detected currents 
from 10 –8 to 10 –15 A. Ions of the undesired sign were discharged 
on the metallic walls of the expansion duct. In addition, the burner 
was  insulated  and  isolated  electrically,  so  it  could  be  ﬂoated  at 
up to ± 300 V. This required minor modiﬁcations to the ﬂow of 
cooling-water  to  and  from  the  burner  [ 60 , 64 ].  The  difference  in 
potential between the burner and the earthed sampling nozzle (at 
a potential, V N , in general) was deﬁned as (cid:2)ϕ = V N – V 
burner = –
burner with respect to ground. Thus if (cid:2)ϕ were positive, the noz- 
V 
zle (as well as the earthed sampling plate) would be at a positive 
potential with respect to the burner.

Fig. 58.  A cross-section [64] of the burner, ﬂame, sampling nozzle, sampling plate and needle-collector. The latter collected those charged species, which had passed from 
the ﬂame, through the sampling oriﬁce and expanded into the ﬁrst vacuum chamber. 

Flame  1  from  Table  1  was  usually  burned  and,  sometimes 
seeded with CsCl or KCl by nebulising an aqueous solution of mo- 
larity  M .  The  magnitudes  of  the  currents,  i +  and  i –,  of  positive 
and negative species, collected by the needle, were measured as 
functions of four variables: V n , (cid:2)ϕ, M and d t , the diameter of the 
sampling  oriﬁce.  The  ﬁrst,  V n ,  only  affected  the  sample  after  it 
had passed through the oriﬁce and had expanded for ∼ 1 mm in- 
side the nozzle. The other three variables determined the eﬃciency 
with which charged species passed through the oriﬁce. It is im- 
portant to note, as was pointed out above in Section 2.2 , that free 
electrons, when approaching a sampling oriﬁce, are likely to leave 
the ﬂame and attach to the metallic nozzle. Thus, a thin region of 
gas was formed adjacent to the nozzle, where the concentration of 
free electrons was less than the concentration of positive ions. In 
addition, an electric ﬁeld would be set up in this sheath, so that 
the bulk of the ﬂame was at a higher electric potential than either 
the nozzle or also the burner. It is likely that such a sheath be- 
comes thicker if the electron density in the ﬂame is lowered [60–
62] . These matters will prove to be important in the following dis- 
cussion. 

Fig. 59 [244] shows the effect of the internal variable, V n , the 
voltage on the collecting needle, on the measured i + and i –. Part 
(a)  is  for  no  additive  to  ﬂame  1,  so  that  only  low-level,  natural 
ionisation was being observed. Consequently, with a relatively low 
electron concentration, the sheath was likely to be thick in case (a), 
where both i + and i – attain constant values for V n > ± 5 V. This in- 
dicates that there is no penetration of the ﬁeld (between the nee- 
dle collector and the interior of the sampling nozzle) through the 
inlet oriﬁce and into the ﬂame. Also, i – (measured with V n  pos- 
itive) is only about (1/500)th of i +  (measured with V n  negative), 
suggesting that few electrons passed through the inlet hole, when 
the level of ionisation was low. Consequently, without Cs added, 
the low i – are caused by the few molecular ions, such as OH – and 
2 –, present in the ﬂame. These molecular ions have much smaller 
O 
diffusivities than free electrons and are collected by a modest po- 
tential on the needle. Part (b) shows that both i + and i – behaved 
quite differently and were much larger, when M/100 CsCl was neb- 
ulised into the unburned gas of the same ﬂame, resulting in much 
higher electron densities in the ﬂame. Here, i +  was saturated for 
V n > 10 V. However, at ﬁrst, i – rose very rapidly, but continued to

In (a) there was no additive in the ﬂame; in (b) M/100 CsCl was nebulised into the 
burner supplies. The magnitudes of i – have been increased by the factors shown for 
clarity. The ﬂame was sampled 20 mm downstream of the burner, where i + and i –
were constant along the ﬂame’s axis. 

grow at a slower, fairly constant rate, whilst V n was increased. Also, 
when V n > 5 V, ( i + / i –) < 10, so a much greater fraction of the 
negative species from a ﬂame has been sampled and collected by 
the needle, than in part (a). This indicates that some free electrons 
did then pass through the oriﬁce. However, i – in part (b) is not 
fully saturated, no doubt because the very diffusive free electrons 
tend to become attached to the metallic sampling nozzle. One con-

Fig. 60.  Plots of i + and i – (plotted as a negative quantity for clarity) versus (cid:2)ϕ for 
aqueous M/10 0 0 CsCl sprayed into the supplies to ﬂame 1. Here V n = ± 9 V, d t = 80 
μm [244] and sampling was 9 mm downstream of the reaction zone. 

clusion here is that in case (a) without Cs added, the sheath was 
thicker than in case (b), thus preventing free electrons from en- 
tering the expansion, when the concentration of free electrons in 
the ﬂame is low. Thus, with Cs present in (b), there was a greater 
tendency towards sampling positive and negative species equally 
eﬃciently. Thus at V n = 35 V, i – / i + = 0.2, so here almost 20 % of 
the free electrons were sampled and collected. Even so, i – was not 
saturated at V n = 35 V and it was clear that more free electrons 
could have been collected by increasing V n further. 

The effect of varying (cid:2)ϕ ( = – V 

burner ), when sampling ﬂame 1 
with Cs added, is shown in Fig. 60 , where i – is shown as a neg- 
ative quantity, purely for clarity. These plots are typical of those 
obtained over wide ranges of concentrations of Cs and of oriﬁce di- 
ameters. The maximum for i + was always at (cid:2)ϕ = 0. Likewise, the 
maximum in i – (mainly a current of free electrons) was at some 
positive value of (cid:2)ϕ, i.e . when the nozzle was positive relative to 
the burner. The value of (cid:2)ϕ, at which i – was maximised, did not 
vary with the molarity, M, or d t . Of course, the question arises as 
to the nature of the electric ﬁelds near the tip of the nozzle. When 
(cid:2)ϕ was negative, it appears from Fig. 60 , that free electrons were 
easily repelled away from the sampling cone. In fact, (cid:2)ϕ = – 3 V 
ensured that i – = 0. Also for (cid:2)ϕ < 0, some of the positive ions are 
seemingly attracted from the sample to the nozzle. Fig. 60 shows 
that when (cid:2)ϕ = 0, i + is a maximum, but i – is extremely small, but 
non-zero, most probably due to only the most energetic free elec- 
trons then overcoming some repelling voltage. When (cid:2)ϕ = 0, the 
electric potential in the bulk of the ﬂame is known [ 60 , 61 ] to be 
higher than that of both burner and sampling nozzle. Thus, with 
(cid:2)ϕ = 0, the ﬁeld near the nozzle repels electrons, but directs pos- 
itive ions towards the nozzle. Also then, a sheath of positive ions 
and neutrals surrounds the nozzle. As for (cid:2)ϕ increasingly above 
zero, i + then slowly declines in Fig. 60 , probably because of a few 
positive ions being increasingly directed by the local electric ﬁeld 
towards the nickel nozzle. This is a consequence of the bulk ﬂame 
being at a higher electric potential than the earthed sampling cone, 
even when (cid:2)ϕ > 0. As for i –, it increases to a maximum at (cid:2)ϕ
∼ 10 V. As discussed below, it turns out that, when (cid:2)ϕ was in- 
creased above zero, at some point the thickness of the sheath at 
the sampling nozzle contracted suddenly and then grew markedly, 
so that the local electric ﬁeld grew, but then collapsed and ﬁnally, 
slowly  became  stronger.  Here  then  is  a  complex  pattern  for  the 
transmission of free electrons through a sampling hole as a func-

in the atomiser, was varied. 

tion of (cid:2)ϕ, which clearly governs the ﬁelds and sheaths near the 
oriﬁce. Ion sheaths will be discussed again below in the context of 
sampling ions for mass spectrometry. 

Fig. 61 shows how i + and i – vary with the strength of the CsCl 
solution in the nebuliser, when otherwise the sampling conditions 
were the same as in Fig. 60 . Both currents eventually rose above 
some  constant  level,  with  the  threshold  for  the  increase  proba- 
bly set inter alia by when the sheath’s thickness became smaller 
than the radius of the inlet hole. Then i + started to increase and 
at ﬁrst did so linearly with M . This linearity corresponds to 100 
% ionisation of the caesium, as expected for low concentrations of 
Cs [ 54 , 75 , 245 ]. However, at an even higher M , the slope decreased 
from unity to one half. This, dependence on M 1/2 is also expected 
[ 75 , 245 ] for equilibrium ionisation of larger concentrations of Cs at 
the high temperature (2400 K) of ﬂame 1. By contrast, i – started to 
increase at a higher value of M . Subsequently, i – then rose at a rate 
greater than expected, so that at the highest M , there were almost 
comparable ﬂows of positive and negative species through the ori- 
ﬁce. Some of these effects are probably accounted for by an ion 
sheath covering the oriﬁce until the concentration of free electrons 
increased to a level suﬃcient to “open a door for them”. Also, the 
situation is complicated by the sheath’s thickness, as noted above, 
suddenly collapsing, when n e was increased with (cid:2)ϕ > 0. 

√ 

It might be expected that i + is proportional to the area of the 
sampling oriﬁce. This is checked in Fig. 62 , which has three plots, 
i + versus d t for different molarities, M , of the CsCl so- 
(A–C), of 
lution. All three plots are straight lines, but with an intercept, sug- 
gesting that positive ions were only detected, when d t  exceeded 
some critical value (of ∼ 25 μm), depending on the electron con- 
centration. However,  for negatively charged species, a  non-linear 
i – and d t was observed for all M . In fact, i –
relationship between 
with a small d t (D–F in Fig. 62 ) is always much less than i + . Thus, 
it appears that with a small d t , a large fraction of the hot gas in a 
sample has to pass through electric ﬁelds in a sheath, where free 
electrons are repelled from the sample. 

√ 

Overall, the indications are that positive ions are much easier 
to sample than free electrons and negative ions, in that i + always 
seems here to have a maximum at (cid:2)ϕ = 0, as seen in Fig. 60 . How- 
ever, Fig. 60 also shows that i – has a maximum at (cid:2)ϕ > 0. This is 
explored further in Fig. 63 , which is a plot of the value of (cid:2)ϕ max- 
imising i – for different molarities of CsCl nebulised into an oxygen- 
f = 
rich ﬂame (unburnt mole fractions: H 
2 /O 
1810 K) at a fairly low temperature [64] . 

2 = 1.50/1.00/4.65; T 

Fig. 63 shows that at low M , the required (cid:2)ϕ is at least + 20 
V, but increases with M , irrespective of the value of d t , the oriﬁce 
diameter. Eventually a value of (cid:2)ϕ is reached, when its magnitude

inlet hole. These matters will now be investigated in the context 
of detecting positive and negative ions mass spectrometrically, but 
there is a clear indication from Fig. 63 that there might be two dif- 
ferent types of sheath, with an almost sudden change from one to 
the other. 

4.5. Plasma sheaths, the application of electric ﬁelds and how to 
detect negative ions 

The  apparatus  in  Fig.  5  was  modiﬁed  to  apply  a  voltage  be- 
tween  the  electrically  ﬂoating  burner  and  the  earthed  combina- 
tion of the sampling nozzle and the front plate holding the nozzle. 
The needle-collector shown in Fig. 58 was not used. Otherwise, the 
voltage on the quadrupole housing was held at ± 288 V and that 
on the wedding ring was adjusted to maximise each ion current. 
In practice, that ﬁrst internal electrode ended up at roughly ± 11 
V, depending on whether positive or negative ions were being ob- 
served. In the ﬁrst experiment [60] , three molarities (10 –1 M, 10 –3 
M and 10 –5 M) of aqueous KCl were nebulised into the unburnt gas 
of ﬂame 1 at 2400 K. A blunt nozzle (from Goodings [88] ) with a 
Pt/Ir electron microscope lens at its tip was used. The ion currents 
2 O were all less than 1 % of those for K + , so 
for Cl –, H 
the main charged species were taken to be K + and free electrons in 
equal concentrations. Similar observations were in fact made with 
a chromium nozzle. 

3 O + and K + .H 

Some results for K + , when varying (cid:2)ϕ, are shown in Fig. 64 , 
as plots of ( I / I max ) versus (cid:2)ϕ [60] . Here I is the ion current for 
K + , measured at 25 mm from the burner, with I max  as its maxi- 
mum value, when plotted against (cid:2)ϕ. The actual values of I max are 
quoted on Fig. 64 . It was particularly useful to measure the current 
through a ﬂame in these experiments [ 60 , 117 , 118 ]. For the three 
levels of ionisation, I was maximised at, respectively, (cid:2)ϕ = 0, + 7 
and + 16 V, for 10 –1 M, 10 –3 M and 10 –5 M. Very strikingly, when 
the concentration of free electrons was highest (at n e  ∼ 3 × 10 11 
el. ml –1 ) with M/10 KCl nebulised, I in Fig. 64 was constant for 
(cid:2)ϕ > 0. This contrasts with I falling dramatically for (cid:2)ϕ < 0. The 
three maximum ion currents, I max , indicated that in changing from 
10 –5 M to 10 –3 M, there was almost a proportional increase in I max . 
This is expected and corresponds to potassium being 100 % ionised 
at the lowest additions of the metal [ 75 , 245 ]. In going from 10 –3 
M  to  10 –1  M  KCl,  I max  increased  more  in  line  with  the  conven- 
tional square root dependence for large concentrations of potas- 
sium [ 75 , 245 ]. Fig. 64 makes it clear that for K +  ( I/I max ) can fall, 
when (cid:2)ϕ is made non-zero, positively or negatively. In either case, 
this suggests that K + ions were attracted to the sampling nozzle. 
In general, this loss depends on (cid:2)ϕ and n e , the concentration of 
free electrons in the ﬂame.

participating  in  steady-state  balances  for  the  individual  negative 
ions. Here the point is that in Fig. 65 , the positive ions, K +  and 
3 O + , had maximum concentrations, when (cid:2)ϕ = 0, but both neg-

ative ions maximised at (cid:2)ϕ > 0. This is very commonly the case, 
unless,  as  in  Fig.  66 ,  the  electron  concentration  happens  to  be 
lower than the concentration of negative ions. Then I K + maximised 
when (cid:2)ϕ = + 16 V, whereas I 
Cl– had a maximum at + 33 V. The 
conclusion is that ion concentrations, positive or negative, should 
be estimated from maxima obtained from plots against (cid:2)ϕ. This is 
because losses are then at a minimum. Thus, in Fig. 65 the max- 
OH – is ∼ 5 times larger than its value measured tradi- 
imum for I

i –. Interestingly, the drop in (cid:2)ϕ coincides with the point in Fig. 61 , 
where i – begins to rise. This is when some free electrons start to 
ﬂow through the sampling oriﬁce. Quite strikingly, after the transi- 
tion, (cid:2)ϕ for a maximum in i – is seen not to depend much on M . In 
fact, the maximum is now a broad one, whereas before the tran- 
sition, i – displayed a sharper maximum in (cid:2)ϕ, as seen in Fig. 60 . 
This implies that there can be sizeable losses of free electrons from 
a sample at low M . Fig. 63 also shows that the drop from high to 
low (cid:2)ϕ is greatest for the smallest oriﬁce. These effects for the 
cool, O

trons, contrast with the hotter ﬂame 1 [64] , where the value of 
(cid:2)ϕ required to maximise i – is always small and below 20 V, with 
no dependence on M . This suggests that, with the hot ﬂame, the 
thickness of the ion sheath is always less than the radius of the

to equilibrium relationships for e.g . reactions (LII) and (LIII). These 
balances  include  the  background  ions  OH – and  O 
2 – in  e.g .  reac- 
tions (XLI–XLIII). Even so, it has proved possible [223] to deduce 
values of (cid:2)H o and (cid:2)S ° for each of these reactions (LIII) and (LIV), 
together with the rate constants of their forward and reverse steps. 
The situation of an alkali metal being added to a ﬂame, together 
with much larger amounts of a halogen, is explored in Fig. 66 . Here 
a 10 –3 M solution of KCl was sprayed from the atomiser into the 
unburned gas of ﬂame 1, Also, the total content of atomic chlo- 
rine was 0.665 mole % (existing as HCl and Cl atoms, coupled by 
equilibrium (LI)) in the burned gas, achieved by adding CHCl 
3  to 
the gas supplied to the burner. The ﬂame was sampled at 25 mm 
downstream of the reaction zone, using a pointed Cr nozzle with 
an inlet diameter of 155 μm. The ratio [Cl] / [HCl] was ∼ 3 × 10 –2 

48 

at equilibrium ( i.e . γ
H = 1) downstream in the burned gas. How- 
ever, [Cl –] / [e –] was estimated to be ∼ 10 at 2400 K, but fell to 
∼ 2.0 in the neck of the oriﬁce. Thus, the presence of so much 
chlorine did reduce n e and consequently the Debye length, λD, be- 
came larger (according to Eq. (2) ) and so most probably affected 
Cl– were maximised, when (cid:2)ϕ was, 
sampling. In Fig. 66 , I K + and I 
respectively,  ∼ + 16 and  ∼ + 33 V. Thus,  the  maximum for K + 
ions  was  no  longer  at  (cid:2)ϕ = 0,  because  of  the  presence  of  rela- 
tively large quantities of Cl – ions. When (cid:2)ϕ was made negative, 
it is likely that free electrons were repelled radially outwards, be- 
yond the stagnation streamline and out of the sample, causing the 
equilibrium (XLVIII) to shift, so the sample became quickly devoid 
of  Cl – ions.  Also,  when (cid:2)ϕ <  0,  I K +  fell  monotonically,  but  not 
to zero. In that case, it is likely that only K + ions from the outer 
regions of a sample were attracted to the Cr nozzle. In fact, the 
corresponding currents through the ﬂame have been detected be- 
fore [ 117 , 118 ]. This means that those K + ions, which were actually 
detected at (cid:2)ϕ = – 80 V, were those near the ﬂame’s axis and 
were convected along by the accelerating ﬂow into the oriﬁce. At 
(cid:2)ϕ = 0, positive ions are still being attracted from the sample to 
the Cr nozzle and some free electrons are being repelled in the lo- 
cal ﬁeld in a sheath of positive ions, as noted above. When (cid:2)ϕ was

5 vol. % of CO 2 in the unburned gas. In addition, M/10 0 0 aqueous KHCO 3 was neb- 
ulised into the unburnt gases. Sampling was 20 mm downstream of the burner, 
using a blunt Goodings nozzle [88] with an oriﬁce 200 μm in diameter. The peak

ing 3 times more abundant than HCO 3 –.

contains K + 
and Cl – ions, as well as free electrons. The burner has a gap or “dark 
space” covering it. Here three plots of ϕ are shown for (cid:2)ϕ ≤ 0. There is a ca- 
thodic sheath of positive ions covering the sampling nozzle. At the burner there is 
an anodic plasma sheath, across which the potential difference is less than 1 V. The 
thicknesses of both sheaths are here exaggerated for clarity. The value of (cid:2)ϕ with

maxima and then decreased and approached steady levels at (cid:2)ϕ
∼ + 200 V. This can be explained by the electric ﬁeld near the tip 
of the nozzle becoming more positive at larger (cid:2)ϕ, probably by 
the sheath ﬁrst becoming thinner. 

The effect, when (cid:2)ϕ was gradually made more positive, was 
for  I K +  to  eventually  fall,  i.e .  for  K +  to  be  attracted  to  the  noz- 
zle, but mobile free electrons to be again repelled out of the sam- 
ple, with a consequential lowering of I 
Cl–. Finally, it is notable that

ﬂame, the maximum in I

have expected I 
K + , because of all the 
free electrons having been mopped up to form Cl – ions, with so 
much chlorine present. The slight discrepancy no doubt arises from 
a few Cl – ions having disappeared during sampling. Even so, there 
is no reason to suppose that positive and negative ions were ob- 
served with different sensitivities. 

Cl– is ∼ 93 % of that for I 

Cl– to have been closer to I

and Cl – at 25 mm downstream of the reaction zone of ﬂame 1, using a pointed Cr 
nozzle, with an oriﬁce diameter of 155 μm. A 10 –3 
M solution of KCl was nebulised 
and chlorine was added by saturating part of the N 2 supply with CHCl 3 . The total 
mole fraction of species containing Cl in the burned gas was 6.65 × 10 –3

To consider the last three Figures, it has to be remembered that 
the interaction of a sampled plasma with the metallic “nozzle” ( i.e . 
the combination of the sampling nozzle and front plate) is unusual, 
in that the plasma here is moving rapidly; in fact, it is accelerat- 
ing to reach sonic velocity in the oriﬁce’s throat. Thus, it has been 
shown [64] that for such a plasma the ﬂuid-mechanical forces ( e.g . 
suction into the oriﬁce) on an ion exceed those causing their diffu- 
sion. However, the diffusion of free electrons, e.g . across the stag-

Fig. 68.  Sketches of ϕ [60] , as in Fig. 67 , but here for (cid:2)ϕ ≥ 0. When (cid:2)ϕ = 0 or (cid:2)ϕ1 , there is a cathodic sheath of positive ions over the sampling cone. If (cid:2)ϕ is made more 
positive, the sheath collapses and becomes a thin anodic plasma sheath. At (cid:2)ϕ2 to (cid:2)ϕ4 (denoted in the centre) the anodic sheath has been assumed to have a constant 
thickness. At the burner, the sheath becomes a cathodic one of positive ions; its thickness has been drawn as constant, because of being limited by the dark gap between 
the burner and the ﬂame’s reaction zone.

nation lines in Fig. 6 , i.e . either into or out of a sample at its edges, 
is certainly possible. Also, Xu [61] has considered the two cases for 
the thickness of a sheath at a metallic electrode. If at a sampling 
nozzle, the difference in potential across the sheath, (cid:2)ϕs = V 
f – V N 
f  is the electric potential in the bulk of the ﬂame) is small, i.e . 
( V 
(cid:2)ϕs  << kT e  / e , the thickness of the sheath is only a “few” λ
D . 
This is sometimes called “a Debye sheath” [61] ; it typically exists 
at an anode and its thickness is mainly independent of the applied 
voltage, (cid:2)ϕ. This contrasts with the case of (cid:2)ϕs > kT e / e , when 
the sheath’s thickness is governed by (cid:2)ϕs . Such a situation, as dis- 
cussed in the following section, usually occurs at a cathode, where 
there will be seen below to be a large drop in potential from the 
ﬂame to the nozzle. In that case, electrons are completely repelled 
from the nozzle and a pure, cathodic ion sheath forms over the 
nozzle. In fact, (cid:2)ϕs = 1 V is then suﬃcient [61] to repel 99 % of 
the free electrons out of a sample. A cathodic ion sheath [61] can 
be ∼ 80 times thicker than an anodic sheath, which is independent 
of the applied voltage bias. Thus, there is then a sheath at the noz- 
zle, but increasingly, when (cid:2)ϕ is made more positive, K + ions are 
attracted to the nozzle and front plate. Free electrons are repelled 
out of the sample, together with some negative ions. 

Figs. 63–65 can now be considered and interpreted in terms of 
plots of the electric potential, ϕ, in a ﬂame between the burner 
and the nozzle. Three plots for (cid:2)ϕ ≤ 0 are shown in Fig. 67 , when 
the nozzle is at a negative potential with respect to the burner. 
One important feature is that ϕ along the bulk of the ﬂame has to 
have a small, but negative gradient. This is because free electrons 
have such a huge mobility that they are able to carry a large cur- 
rent, when the ﬁeld has a low gradient, ∇ϕ. This means that ϕ in 
the bulk ﬂame has to exceed that at both the burner and the noz- 
zle, so that the drop in ϕ at e.g . the nozzle becomes larger than 
the (cid:2)ϕ, applied between the nozzle and the burner. This is seen 
in  Fig.  67 ,  where  the  gas  in  the  ﬂame  moves  from  left  to  right 
and the reaction zone (not shown) is ∼ 1 mm from the burner. 
Charged entities, such as K + , Cl – and free electrons, ﬁrst appear in 
the reaction zone, but free electrons can diffuse counter-currently 
(and against the local ﬁeld) across the relatively cold gap cover- 
ing the burner. The sheath at the nozzle has been shown [61] to 
have a thickness, which increases as ( (cid:2)ϕ) m , where 0.5 < m < 1. 
When (cid:2)ϕ = 0, Xu [61] has demonstrated that the bulk ﬂame is at 
ϕ ∼ + 0.6 V, which is enough to repel most free electrons away 
from the “nozzle” and to ensure that the more energetic ones can 
move back to the burner. Thus, at the nozzle there is a sheath con- 
taining K + ions and neutrals, but when (cid:2)ϕ is made more negative, 
K +  ions  are  increasingly attracted  to  the  nozzle  and  front  plate. 
Also, negative ions and free electrons are repelled out of the sam- 
ple, across the stagnation line. This was observed in Figs. 64–66 . 

Now consider Fig. 68 , for when (cid:2)ϕ is made progressively more 
positive above zero. The proﬁle of ϕ for (cid:2)ϕ = 0 has been trans- 
ferred  here  from  Fig.  67 .  That  for  the  slightly  positive  (cid:2)ϕ
1  in 
Fig. 68 is similar to that for (cid:2)ϕ = 0, in that there is still a sheath of 
positive ions around the nozzle. On further increasing (cid:2)ϕ to (cid:2)ϕ
2 , 
the sheath collapses to its thinnest and the current, I K + , detected 
by the mass spectrometer becomes a maximum. No K +  ions are 
then lost to the sampling nozzle. Complications arise here, when 
(cid:2)ϕ then becomes increasingly positive. The ﬁrst is that free elec- 
trons  can  cross  a  stagnation streamline and  enter  a  sample,  be- 
cause of being attracted by a sheath, mainly of positive ions. In 
addition, reaction (XLVIII) shifts when a sample accelerates (and 
thereby cools by up to ∼ 600 K) into the neck of the oriﬁce. Such 
a perturbation means that Cl – ions are lost from a sample. Whilst 
(cid:2)ϕ is being made increasingly positive, the anodic sheath at the 
nozzle remains thin and largely independent of (cid:2)ϕ. The thickness 
of such an anodic sheath is usually a few λD [ 61 , 62 , 246 , 247 ]. Cer- 
tainly, λD can be expected to affect the transmission of free elec- 
trons through a sampling oriﬁce, because, when n e is small enough 

for λD > d t /2, a sampling oriﬁce is totally covered by an ion sheath. 
Thus, Fig. 64 showed I K +  for large variations in n e . In particular, 
when n e was highest and (cid:2)ϕ > 0, I K + was constant, but did fall, 
for smaller n e on increasing (cid:2)ϕ. 

With (cid:2)ϕ > 0, the current through the ﬂame is maintained by 
positive ions moving against the ﬂow back to the burner. This re- 
quires the gradient of the electric ﬁeld, ∇ϕ, to be positive along 
the ﬂame’s length. At the burner, K +  ions move across the cold 
gap, where ∇ϕ is large in Fig. 68 . In Fig. 66 , the maxima for I K + 
and I 
Cl– have been taken [60] as indicative of the concentrations of 
these ions in the ﬂame. This point probably merits further investi- 
gation, because it does not appear to have been ﬁrmly proved, be- 
ing based on a maximum in an ion current indicating that fewest 
such ions have been lost. Nevertheless, it is now clear that the ma- 
jority of previous investigations of negative ions in ﬂames have re- 
ported serious under-estimates of their concentrations. In Fig. 65 , 
the concentration of OH – measured with (cid:2)ϕ = 0 was seen to be 5 
times too small. This means that many previous measurements of 
negative ions in ﬂames should be repeated by applying a voltage 
between the burner and a suitable “sampling nozzle”. In particu- 
lar, several measurements of electron aﬃnities should be repeated 
by also varying the size of the sampling oriﬁce to ensure that the 
correct extrapolation to either zero or inﬁnite d t  has been made. 
In addition, Figs. 64–66 do indicate that some theoretical work on 
these sampling situations would be useful. 

5. Conclusions 

The mass spectrometric sampling of ions in ﬂames has been re- 
viewed from historical, theoretical, practical and applied perspec- 
tives. The design of systems for sampling ﬂames burning at atmo- 
spheric pressure has been traced back to their ﬁrst prototypes. An 
important and essential feature of a new instrument is the ability 
to change easily and quickly the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce 
from ∼ 50 to ∼250 μm. Pointed, electro-formed chromium nozzles 
have attractions, especially for studying ions. This is because the 
application of an electric ﬁeld between the burner and the combi- 
nation of the sampling nozzle and its mounting plate is essential 
for investigating negative ions, where the need for large inlet ori- 
ﬁces (and consequently for large pumps) is now clear. Two vacuum 
chambers will suﬃce. In the ﬁrst chamber, ions of one sign are se- 
lected; in the second, the mass spectrometer is housed 

Perturbations  of  a  sample,  continuously  withdrawn  from  a 
ﬂame burning at 1 bar, only happen if there is in the ﬂame a rapid, 
exothermic reaction, occurring with a time constant less than ∼
0.5 μs, a ﬁgure which depends on the composition of the ﬂame. 
Such a fast reaction will inevitably be at equilibrium in the ﬂame, 
where the total residence time exceeds several ms. Otherwise, if 
these conditions are not met, sampling is genuine. If there is a per- 
turbation, it usually occurs by a sample being cooled in one of two 
ways, depending on the diameter of the sampling oriﬁce, d t . If d t < 
100 μm, a sample ﬁrst loses heat to the cooler sampling nozzle and 
next cools further on accelerating to the speed of sound at the nar- 
rowest point of the inlet into the ﬁrst vacuum chamber. The sam- 
ple’s composition changes by the equilibrium in question shifting 
its position to that for the lowered temperature at the start of the 
supersonic expansion. However, if on the other hand, the sampling 
oriﬁce is large ( d t > 150 μm), the thermal boundary layer is sucked 
into the sampling system, so cooling occurs ﬁrst, in the accelera- 
tion to the sonic velocity at the oriﬁce’s neck, and secondly dur- 
ing the subsequent near-adiabatic expansion into the ﬁrst vacuum 
chamber of the mass spectrometer. For a chemical equilibrium to 
shift during the expansion, its time constant in the ﬂame must be 
less than ≈ 0.05 μs, depending on the sample’s composition. If 100 
μm < d t < 150 μm, all three modes of cooling might operate for 
a sample from a ﬂame at 1 atm. Theoretical aspects of these ways

of cooling have been examined, as also have the implications for 
sampling neutral species in ﬂames at reduced pressures. 

paper. Last, but not least, there is Jim Thompson, whom I thank 
for his help with the ﬁgures. 

Many  equilibria  have  been  established  for  positive  ions  in  a 
ﬂame  at  1  atm.  Although  these  reactions  are  perturbed  during 
sampling, their  apparent equilibrium constants can  be measured 
for different diameters of the sampling oriﬁce. Next, these mea- 
surements  are  extrapolated  to  an  oriﬁce  size  of  either  zero  (for 
when using large d t ) or inﬁnity, if d t is small. This yields the gen- 
uine equilibrium constant at the temperature and pressure of the 
sample, after it has been simply accelerated adiabatically and isen- 
tropically  to  the  speed  of  sound.  This  approach  was  particularly 
successful  for  measuring  the  hydration  energies  of  several  posi- 
tive ions. These studies of hydrated ions led to measurements of 
how much a sample cools in the thermal boundary layers covering 
the entrance to a smaller sampling oriﬁce. This cooling was shown 
to be less for larger inlet holes. Hydrated negative ions appear to 
have  been  ignored,  in  that  no  one  has  studied  them  in  ﬂames. 
Analogous ions, like Li + .CO, have been investigated, together with 
other  equilibria,  such  as:  MnOH + + H = Mn + + H 
2 O.  This  yielded 
the  equilibrium  constants  for  various  reactions  at  different  tem- 
peratures, as well as their values of (cid:2)H o  and (cid:2)S o . Another suc- 
cess was to measure the proton aﬃnities of several species and the 
ionisation energies of others. There are several examples of good 
agreement between the (cid:2)H o  and (cid:2)S o  reported above and those 
deduced quite independently by others, using different techniques. 
This concordance does conﬁrm the procedures and e.g . the values 
of temperatures used here. This provides conﬁdence to extend the 
use of these procedures. 

2 –, BO –, HWO 

Negative ions are more complicated, in that for them, steady 
states are usually set up, whereby the rates of formation and dis- 
appearance of each ion actually balance one another. Such a steady 
state can be shifted by cooling a sample, just as for positive ions. 
However,  negative  ions  are  complicated  by  free  electrons  often 
leaving a sample to attach to the metallic sampling nozzle, thereby 
causing a steady state to shift and the spectrum of negative ions 
to  change.  Negative  ions  usually  have  concentrations  coupled  to 
the  concentrations  of  free  electrons  via  the  general  equilibrium: 
Y – + H = HY + e –. Such equilibria are shifted on cooling a sample, as 
well as by this loss of free electrons to a metallic sampling nozzle. 
Much of the early work on the negative ions of additives (creating 
2 –) ignored these 
e.g . BO 
perturbations and so needs checking carefully to provide accurate 
electron aﬃnities, etc . One reason for this re-working is that ﬂames 
are weak plasmas, so free electrons do not pass through smaller 
sampling oriﬁces, if the Debye length exceeds the diameter of the 
inlet hole. Thus, it is important to vary the size of the sampling 
hole and the voltage between the burner and the sampling system 
to optimise the sampling of ions. The rate constant for electron- 
detachment in Y – + H → HY + e – has been measured for the halide 
ions from the extent of the perturbation it caused. Such measure- 
ments of rate constants should be extended to other negative ions, 
participating in equilibria. Quite surprisingly, negative ions, even in 
hydrocarbon ﬂames, have been somewhat neglected, so that ions 
in ﬂames of e.g . CO and NH
