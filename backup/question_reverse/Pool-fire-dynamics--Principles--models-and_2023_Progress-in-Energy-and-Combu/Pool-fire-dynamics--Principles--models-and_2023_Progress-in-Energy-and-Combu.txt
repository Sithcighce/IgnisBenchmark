Pool  fire  is generally  described  as a  diffusion combustion  process that  occurs above a horizontal fuel  surface
(composed of gaseous or volatile condensed fuel) with low (~zero) initial momentum. Fundamentally, this type
of  diffusion  combustion  can  be  represented  by  basic  forms  ranging  from  a  small  laminar  candle  flame,  to  a
turbulent medium-scale sofa fire, and up a storage tank fire, or even a massive forest fire. Pool fire research thus
not only has fundamental scientific significance for the study of classical diffusion combustion, but also plays an
important  role  in  practical  fire  safety  engineering.  Therefore,  pool  fire  is  recognized  as  one  of  the  canonical
configurations in both the combustion and fire science communities. Pool fire research involves a rich, multi-
lateral,  and  bidirectional  coupling  of  fluid  mechanics  with  scalar  transport,  combustion,  and  heat  transfer.
Because of the unabated large-scale disasters that can occur and the numerous and complex ’unknowns’ involved
in pool fires, several new questions have been raised with accompanying solutions and old questions have been
revisited,  particularly  in  recent  decades.  Significant  developments  have  occurred  from  a  variety  of  different
perspectives  in  terms  of  pool  fire  dynamics,  and  thus  the  scientific  progress  made  must  be  summarized  in  a
systematic  manner.  This  paper  provides  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  basic  fundamentals  of  pool  fires,
including  the  scale  effect,  the  wind  effect,  pressure  and  gravity  effects,  and  multi-pool  fire  dynamics,  with
particular focus on recent advances in this century. As the fundamentals of pool fires, the theoretical progress
made with regard to burning rates, air entrainment, flame pulsation, the morphological characteristics of flames,
radiation, and the dimensional modelling are reviewed first, followed by new insights into the fluid mechanics
involved, radiative heat transfer and combustion modeling. With regard to the scale effect, recent experimental
and theoretical advances in internal thermal transport and fluid motions within the liquid-phase fuel, lip height
effects, and heat transfer blockage are summarized systematically. Furthermore, new understandings of aspects
including heat feedback and the burning rate, flame tilt, flame length and instability, flame sag and base drag,
and soot and radiation behavior under wind, pressure and gravity effects are reviewed. The growing research
into the onset and the merging dynamics of multiple pool fires in the last decade is described in the last section,
this research will be helpful in the mitigation of threatening outdoor massive (group) fires. This review provides
a state-of-the-art survey of the knowledge gained through decades of research into this topic, and concludes by
discussing the challenges and prospects with regard to the complex coupling effects of heat transfer, with the
fluid and combustion mechanics of pool fires in future work.

At present, although renewable and low-carbon alternative energy
sources and techniques continue to appear in light of their sustainability

energy  supply  demands,  and  these  fuels  still  account  for  a  large  pro-
portion  of  overall  energy  consumption.  Additionally,  sectors  such  as
shipping, aviation and petrochemicals will still be dependent on oil for
some time. The total annual consumption of petroleum and other liquid
fuels of several representative countries around the globe is illustrated in
Fig. 1. As shown in the figure, consumption in developed regions, such
as the United States and the European Union remains at relatively high
levels. With the rapid development in their economy, the demand for oil
in  China  is  continuing  to  rise  strongly  [1].  Over  the  last  five  years,

China’s  annual  crude  oil  imports  have  increased  steadily  to  reach  an
average of 10.1 million barrels per day [1]. These hydrocarbon fuels are
ordinarily stored in refineries and industrial storage facilities to handle
the  temporal  peak-shaving  required  to  maintain  the  balance  between
energy  supply  and  energy  demand.  Long-term  drivers  of  growth  will
continue to push up global oil demand, but there are still serious fire
safety concerns for the transport, storage and use of oil.

Outdoors pool fires are the most common hazards when industrial
accidents occur. A hazardous pool fire usually corresponds to a scenario
in  which  fuel  is  confined  by  a  physical  barrier  to  remain  within  in  a
prescribed area, e.g., open-topped storage tank fires. Alternatively, the
term may refer to a fire where the flammable liquid can flow along a
surface or substance and the overall size of the fire can then develop
without any constraint (e.g., a spill fire inside a bund wall). This type of

fire  would  cause  large  amounts  of  radiant  heat  flux  and  dense  black
smoke to emanate into the atmosphere. Additionally, a pool fire would
probably trigger an explosion, fireballs or even the dispersal of a toxic
cloud.  All countries worldwide  have a  long history of  pool fires acci-
dents. In 1977, two pool fires started in tanks that were used to store
liquid propane as a result of weld failure and the attendant release of fuel
in Umm Said, Qatar. Seven people were killed in this accident, which
cost the equivalent of US $ 76 million at the time. In 2019, a massive
chemical  plant  fire  broke  out  because  of  an  accidental  fuel  leak  in
Houston, Texas, and this fire had a tremendous impact on the air quality,
the water quality and the environment in the surrounding area. Most
recently, a tank fire accident that caused 44 deaths occurred in 2019 in
Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China. As long as the usage of fossil fuel
remains at a high level, the potential for pool fire problems will be severe

for a long time, particularly in developing countries. The incentives to
mitigate  the  occurrence  of  the  hazards  that  cause  pool  fires  and  the
associated emission of pollutant necessitates a fundamental investiga-
tion and deep understanding of this topic. Therefore, the study of pool
fire dynamics will be a significant step toward prevention of this type of
accidents.

As noted above, the term ‘pool fire’ is defined as the combustion of
flammable liquid or evaporating substances at their base with a diffusion
flame.  In  addition,  from  a  scientific  perspective,  this  term  is  also
commonly  used  to  describe  the  burning  of  solid  fuels  such  as  poly-
methylmethacrylate (PMMA) [2–4], and it is thus used to describe forest
fires [5–8], as diffusion combustion events with a low (~zero) initial
fuel momentum. Therefore, in science, the term ‘pool fire’  refers to a
broader  range  of  combustion  scenarios  than  it  does  in  practical
application.

The study of pool fire, which is usually deemed to be an uncontrolled
form  of  buoyancy-induced  diffusion  combustion  stabilized  on  a  flat
condensed-fuel surface with low-momentum that has been vaporized or
gasified by turbulent flame heat transfer [9], is primarily motivated by
safety concerns. Basically, pool fire research involves rich, multilateral,
bidirectional coupling of fluid mechanics and scalar transport, in com-
bination with chemistry, thermodynamics and heat transfer. As a clas-
sical  research  topic  for  both  fire  and  combustion,  the  scientific
significance of the study of pool fire is that it has advanced the knowl-
edge of the highly complex fuel burning process by dividing it into many
separable parts and investigating the interactions between them [10].
Ranging from basic observations that include the fuel evaporation, air
entrainment  and  buoyancy  induced  fluid  motion  to  the  microscopic
convective,  the  diffusion  process  in  the  fire  plume,  the  combustion
process,  and  soot  formation,  radiative  heat  transfer,  these  individual
different  aspects  of  pool  fires  and  their  intimate  interactions,  which
mainly occur in a normal quiescent atmosphere, have been investigated
extensively for more than half a century since the early 1950’s.

The  gross  structure  of  pool  fires  could  be  generally  divided  into
several fairly and well-defined zones [11,12] as illustrated in Fig. 2. The
first is the fuel itself, convective flow behavior within the fuel affects the
evaporation rate. Then, an unburnt fuel-rich core in conical shape exists
above  the  fuel  with  persistent  luminous  flame  surrounded.  Luminous
flame is intermittently present higher up in the intermittent region with
a time-dependent visible flame tip where air is convected radially into
the  fire.  Above  the  luminous  flame  is  the  non-reacting  plume  zone,
which is usually fully-turbulent in nature. For the purpose of compre-
hensively describing the burning of pool fire structures, each regime has
been  extensively  investigated  and  quantified  via  the  measurable  con-
trolling  parameters  shown  in  Fig.  2,  which  are  representative  of  the
typical attributes of a pool fire.

In the combustion process of a pool fire, with regard to the burning
rates, the energetics of the fuel surfaces arising from the enthalpy lead to
vaporization  of  the  fuel, and this  forms  a  positive feedback  loop that
enlarges the flame structures (i.e., the flame height in still air) during a
developing  combustion  stage.  Studies  of  scale  effects  are  particularly
important  for  determination  of  pool  burning  behavior.  Subsequently,
more fresh air would be entrained into the reactive flow, and the tem-
perature and velocity of the flame would also change with the rise in the
heat release rate (HRR), along with the time-varying fluctuations that
occur with potential change in the flame turbulence. Radiative emission
from a turbulent flame to its surroundings, which shows a highly non-
linear  dependence  on  Planck’s  function,  will  also  increase  in  turn
because of the combination of the increasing HRR and the soot forma-
tion. Additionally, the occurrence of self-sustained oscillation at a well-
established  frequency  along  with  shedding  of  large  toroidal  coherent
structures  has  an  impact  on  flame  entrainment,  soot  formation,  and
other processes. Generally, these individual physical aspects of natural-
convection (buoyancy) controlled pool fire in an ideal stationary con-
dition have been addressed by a large number of studies, which has led
to the formation of some basic knowledge and several classical theories

and models.

At  present,  solid,  liquid  and  gaseous  fuels  are  commonly  used  to
characterize pool fire combustion behavior experimentally. An experi-
mental platform associated with some new and emerging techniques is
deliberately  introduced  here  to  provide  better  understanding  of  the
following  sections.  During  the  course  of  combustion,  the  fuel  level
should regress as the fuel is consumed, and thus the fuel-level control
configurations are designed and structured in different ways to simplify
this complex issue into a steady-state mode. Fig. 3 illustrates the most
commonly used fuel delivery systems for pool fire studies, among which
configurations (b), (c) and (e) do not require a power supply according
to the communicating principles.

Essentially, the fact that combustion in pool fires occur primarily in
the vapor phase suggests the possible exploitation of suitably designed
gaseous burners. To decouple the effects of heat feedback from the pool
fire burning behaviors and simulate the subsequent gas phase combus-
tion  after  fuel  vaporizing,  gaseous  pool-like  burners  have  also  been
applied widely to emulate condensed fuel pool fires. These burners use a
controllable heat release rate, which is determined by the gaseous fuel
supply rate, to investigate the pool fire dynamics and flame properties in
steady  burning.  Corlett  [17,18]  pioneered  the  use  of  a  water-cooled
diffusive gas burner to investigate the steady-stage burning of pool fire
as illustrated in Fig. 4a); this type burner can measure the convection
heat  feedback.  Additionally,  researchers  also used  gaseous  burners  to
investigate  fundamentally  the  effect  of  HRR  on  pool  fire  dynamics
[19–24]. The typical attributes of a pool fire including the flame height
and oscillation frequency are found to compare well with that of realistic
pool fires at the same HRR (see Figs. 23, 32 in Section 3).

In recent years, Quintiere and co-workers [25–29] have developed
improved burners named burning rate emulator (BRE) and procedures
for more reliable net heat flux measurement to match the burning rate of
a condensed fuel pool fire as illustrated in Fig. 4b); the BRE emulates this
type of non-premixed combustion through matching of four key prop-
erties, comprising the heat of combustion, the surface temperature, the
smoke point2, and the heat of gasification. Note that the condensed fuel
surface is isothermal and observed to be approximately at the boiling
point.  However,  an  isothermal  surface  condition  does  not  hold  for  a
gaseous burner. The critical information with regard to the BRE design
theory will be introduced in details in Section 2.

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, several reviews have reported
on the research progress made with regard to pool fires since the 1960’s.
The  generalized  monograph  by  Blinov  and  Khudyakov  in  1961  [30]
primarily reported on the flame shapes and dimensions of burning liq-
uids  in  stationary  atmospheres,  where  the  burning  rate,  temperature,
pulsation  and  radiation  properties  were  all  included.  In  1972,  the
fundamental aspects of combustion of liquid fuels were reviewed, con-
sisting  of  assessment  of  the  effects  of  the  fuel  properties,  the  pan
diameter, and the atmospheric conditions on the burning rates, along
with the liquid-phase transfer process between the flame and the fuel
[31].  Following  these  reviews,  additional  literature  emerged  that
covered specific topics such as the thermal radiation hazards from hy-
drocarbon  pool  fires  [32]  and  further  development  in  the  pool  fire
burning characteristics that were relevant to the flame structure, the fuel
consumption, and the heat transfer mechanism [12]. A relatively recent
review by Joulain [9] addressed pertinent advancements specifically in
terms  of  the  formation  and  properties  of  the  soot,  flame  and  plume
characteristics,  and  the  heat  feedback/mass  loss  rate  of  a  pool  fire.
Additionally, in 2007 [11], Steinhaus et al. highlighted large-scale pool
fires with higher soot levels, along with the liquid spill pool fires, where
confinement of the fuel by the vessel does not exist (i.e., where the fuel
surface area develops along with the burning process). Hu [33] recently
presented  an  overview  of  the  inherent  physics  and  the  relevant

diffusion flame occurs.

correlations  for  pool  fire  characteristics  with  emphasis  placed  on  the
burning rate and the flame geometry, in the presence of wind. However,
each  of  the  pool  fire-related  reviews  mentioned  above  has  its  own

individual focus, and it is an arduous task to synthesize all these aspects
of  the  complexity  of  the  combustion  process  into  a  holistic  under-
standing of pool fire behavior.

Taken together, the significant developments that have been made
from a variety of new perspectives have allowed sufficiently extensive
knowledge to be amassed to reinforce the importance of a comprehen-
sive  review  and  enable  an  integrated  overview  of  confined  pool  fire
burning to be provided. Over the last two decades, some of the relevant
fundamental  theories  about  pool  fires  have  been  complemented  and
enriched to enable further scientific developments. Recent representa-
tive  advances  in  understanding  of  pool  fires  have  stemmed  from  the
continuously deepening understanding of pool fire dynamics and new
concerns about environmental effects that originate from the relevant
engineering  applications.  These  advances  include:  prediction  of  the
burning rates of a broad range of commercially available fuels and pool
diameters based on some fundamental fuel properties [34]; the effects of
varied  single  or  multiple  boundary  conditions  on  the  combustion
behavior of pool fire, particularly with respect to the effects of pressure
(P) [35–37], the external wind/crossflow (u) [33,38-41], the accelera-
tion due to gravity (g) [27,42], and the oxygen concentration (O2) [43].
Additional advances comprise the effect of turbulent mixing following
the air entrainment process on the turbulent diffusion flame geometry
[44]; the critical onset [45] and the evolution of the puffing phenome-
non [46], along with the connection between the dynamics of toroidal
vortices  and  diffusion  flame  flickering  [47];  the  application  of  a
multi-point sources model to calculation of the thermal radiation [48,
49]; and multiple pool fires burning rates and interaction dynamics [15,
50-52]. Specifically, when the numerous experimental studies of pool
fire  burning  under  varied  boundary  conditions  are  considered,  the
changes  from  the  noticeable  flame  morphological  structures  to  the
microscopic heat transfer mechanism have been introduced systemati-
cally,  but  there  were few  references  to  these  changes  in  the  previous
review literature. In view of these new advances, a comprehensive re-
view  article  should  be  produced  and  upgraded  to  demonstrate  these
unknowns  on  the  basis  of  classical  theory,  and  to  allow  a  more
comprehensive database to be established to validate and improve the
numerical fire models.

Motivated  by  the  considerations  above,  this  paper  provides  an
overview of the state of the art of the knowledge about the experimental
works  and  dimensionless  modelling  of  pool  fires  when  confined  in  a
vessel. There is a need to consolidate the existing knowledge about pool
fires and compile a comprehensive review with regard to new and recent
advances  on  pool  fires  that  covers  a  wide  range  of  topics,  from  heat
transfer with the associated burning rate, flame morphological charac-
teristics,  and  air  entrainment,  to  flames  emanating  radiation  under
different types of boundary conditions. Readers should bear in mind that
countless works relevant to the topic of pool fires are available in the
literature, covering topics such as combustion chemistry, the formation
of toxic products in pool fires and modern computational fluid dynamics
approaches,  which  may  be  omitted  because  of  the  limitations  of  the
authors’  knowledge.  Therefore,  to  provide  a  manageable  amount  of
material,  the  research  area  that  is  reviewed  in  this  paper  has  been
limited. This review is expected to help the readers understand pool fires

to a deeper level from a diverse range of perspectives, and to provide a
review  document  with  respect  to  the  pool  fire  phenomenon  and  the
related science.

1.2. Review structure

In  this  paper,  the  classical  and  state-of-the-art  research  into
condensed fuel pool fires that are confined within vessels with walls of a
certain  height  and  gaseous  fuel  diffusion  flames  stabilized  on  a  gas
burner is reviewed, with particular focus on the recent progress made
over  the  last  two  decades.  Experimental  and  theoretical  approaches
have  been  used  to  reveal  the  burning  behaviors  and  describe  the
dimensionless modelling of pool fires under a wide variety of boundary
conditions.  The  basic  theories  are  summarized  first  to  form  a  funda-
mental basis for the review. The boundary conditions that essentially
affect the heat transfer process and the burning rate, e.g., scale effects,
wind  effects,  pressure,  oxygen,  and  gravity  effects  are  considered,
because they are important for estimation of pool fire hazards in reality.
The  air  entrainment  and  the  flame’s  morphological  characteristics,
which both have strong relationships with the combustion process, are
also  discussed. In  particular,  when  the  wind  acts  on  the  pool  fires,  it
causes  both  the  flame  morphological  characteristics  and  the  air
entrainment to change significantly. With regard to radiation, the main
focus will be on estimation of the heat fluxes toward the surroundings
using  the  radiation  models,  where  soot  production  is  of  particular
concern  because  it  is  closely  related  to  the  heat  radiation  properties.
With  regard  to  multi-pool  fires,  the  discussion  focuses  on  the  flame
merging  dynamics,  the  burning  rates  and  the  flame  morphological
characteristics.

This survey of progress in pool fire research, which has been cate-

gorized into five parts, is structured as follows:

1)  The inter-dependence between the burning rate and the energetics
(energy)  has  been  clarified  following  the  introduction  of  several
fundamental aspects of burning rates, which included the classical
partitioning  of  the  heat  feedback  over  the  fuel  surface  into  three
forms, stagnant film theory, and the Emmons solution for fuel plate
under crosswind. In light of the effects of environmental conditions
and practical engineering application issues, the effects of pool scale,
pressure,  oxygen  and  wind  on  the  burning  rates  are  summarized
extensively. Progressive research with regard the transport processes
and the energy distribution within the liquid-phase fuel of a pool fire,
prediction models for burning rates that contain a diverse range of
fuel  properties  and  pan sizes,  the  effects  of  the  lip height  and  the
wind on evolution of the heat feedback, and the quantitative rela-
tionship between the burning rate and pressure, oxygen concentra-
tion, and other factors, are reviewed. The fundamentals with regard
to  the  mass  burning  rate  are  then  summarized  under  a  variety  of
internal  (scale, and  lip height  effects)  and  external  boundary  con-
ditions (wind, pressure, and oxygen effects).

2)  The air entrainment mechanism of the pool fire flame in still air is
outlined and is discussed under open space conditions, along with
the associated flame morphological characteristics and detailed fire
plume  characteristics,  including  the  flame  height,  oscillation  fre-
quency, temperature, and velocity. Several newly summarized fea-
tures, including pool fire flame characteristics (i.e., air entrainment,
flow structure, flame height, and flame temperature) under confined
condition,  flame  height  under  various  pressure  and  gravity  condi-
tions,  and  the  wind-blown  pool  fire  temperature  and  velocity  are
described in detail. In addition, theoretical advancements with re-
gard to the pool fire flame height using the turbulent mixing concept,
puffing onset and transition features are explained. Additionally, the
distinct pool fire flame combustion behavior observed under cross-
wind, including flame sag, flame base drag and flame streaks, along
with its oscillation behavior are highlighted as a separate section in
this chapter following considerable recent progress in the research.
3)  With  regard  to  the  radiation,  classical  radiation  models,  theories
including  gaseous  (non-luminous  gas)  emissions  caused  by  water
vapor and carbon dioxide, and luminous soot particle emission are
overviewed  systematically.  Additionally,  methodologies  for  deter-
mination  of  key  parameters  (including  the  Schmidt  temperature3,
and the soot spectral absorption coefficient) for pool fire radiation
are  also  presented  that  comprises  several  new  measurement  tech-
niques.  Radiative  heat  transfer  to  specific  adjacent  targets  is  also
discussed  via  assessment  of  the  different  calculation  models.  In
addition,  the  scale,  sub-atmospheric  pressure,  and wind  effects  on
the fraction of the total heat release rate that is emitted by radiation
is also summarized.

4)  Multi-pool  fires  flame  interactions  and  behavior  are  summarized
based  on  three  major  aspects:  the  flame  merging  dynamics,  the
burning rates, and the flame geometries. In particular, flame height
prediction formulas are presented.

5)  Finally,  a  summary  of  this  research  survey  is  presented,  and  in
conclusion,  some  future  challenges  and  insights  into  the  research
prospects for certain pool fire topics are discussed.

2. Heat transfer and burning rate

2.1. Fundamentals

The burning rate or evaporation rate of a liquid pool fire is deter-
mined based on the energy required to vaporize the condensed fuel and
the net heat flux passing to the fuel surface. The steady burning rate is
usually given in the form of the gasification rate, as follows:

where   ̇q
l, are the heat input to the fuel surface and the heat
output/loss from the fuel, respectively, and ΔHg = Lv +
CpdT is the heat
of gasification, which is composed of the heat of vaporization Lv plus the
‘sensible  energy’  required  to  bring  the  liquid  temperature  from  its
original value to its evaporation temperature.

In 1956, a comprehensive study of liquid pool fire burning with di-
ameters ranging from 3.7 mm to 22.9 m [30] was first reported. Three
burning regimes, comprising laminar, transition and turbulent burning,
were  identified  to  occur  as  the  pool  diameter  increased  (as  shown  in
Fig. 5). Hottel [53] reviewed the report of Blinov and Khudyakov, pro-
vided a semi-quantitative analysis of the heat transfer to the fuel surface
to aid in interpretation of the dependence of the burning rate on the pool

k1, and k2 are the conductive heat transfer coefficient and the convective
heat transfer coefficient, respectively. k3  is equal to σF, where σ is the
Stefan-Boltzman  constant  and  F  is  the  geometric  view  factor  that  the
liquid has with respect to the flame. κ is the extinction coefficient.

As mentioned earlier, steady-state burning of a pool fire that is sta-
bilized  on  a  condensed-fuel  could  be  simulated  by  the  burning  rate
emulator (BRE) using gas, which can be formulated with respect to the
heat of gasification ΔHg  (see Eq. (2-1)). In Fig. 6, a comparison of the
surface area energy balances of an infinitely thick pool fire and the BRE
is  illustrated.  The  heat  of  combustion  ΔHc  and  the  flame  radiation,
which is represented by the laminar smoke point can be best matched to
the stable burning rates of pool fires by selecting a gaseous fuel/inert gas
mixture [26]. However, the heat of gasification requires determination
of the net heat flux on the burner surface, and the surface temperature
must be measured directly. First, the effective heat of combustion of the
fuel-inert gas mixture ΔHc,e is expressed as:

ΔHc,e = Yf ΔHc,f

(2-3)

where ΔHc,f is the combustion heat of fuel included in the mixture, and
Yf is the mass fraction, which is given as XfMWf/MWmix.Here, Xf repre-
sents the molar fraction of the fuel, and MWf  and MWmix  are the mo-
lecular weights of the fuel and the gaseous mixture, respectively. The
smoke point of the fuel-inert gas mixture is

measuring  the  net  heat  flux,  the  gasification  heat  can  be  controlled.

At present, two favored methods are used to measure the burner heat
flux  [28].  The  first  uses  embedded  heat  flux  gauges  to  perform  local
measurements, and this method was used to determine the approximate
mean heat flux over the entire surface. The second method is known as
calorimetry based on the energy balance method [54]. Slug calorimeters
measure  the  heat  flux  by  assuming  one-dimensional  conduction  to  a
cylindrical  slug  that  has  known  thermal  properties.  Use  of  slug  calo-
rimeter to determine the mean heat flux is better than local measure-
ments performed using gages because of the radial variation of the heat
flux that occurs on the burner surface. By setting up a formula for the
flame’s  net  heat  flux,  the  effective  heat  of  gasification  ΔHg  can  be
determined using Eq. (2-1).

Validation  experiments  using  the  BRE  were  performed  through
emulation of heptane, methanol, PMMA, and POM [26]. The burning
rate of real fuel of 5 cm diameter pool fires was measured and matched
with the BRE. The appearance of the flame, including the flame’s height,

mass  transfer  B-number  analysis.  The  original  B-number  concept  was
developed by Spalding for analysis of the evaporation of single droplets,
but it can also be applied to the burning of liquid fuels when the asso-
ciated flame is non-luminous (i.e., very low emissivity) and convection
heat transfer is dominant. Provided that both the Prandtl number and
the Schmidt number have values of unity, i.e., Pr = ν/αt  ≈ 1 and the
Schmidt number, Sc = ν/Dd ≈ 1, and that the reaction rate is infinite and
the  burning  is  stoichiometric  within  the  flame  zone,  analysis  of  the
conservation equations (for energy, fuel, oxygen and products) enables
identification of a series of conserved variables of the ’b’ number that are
equivalent to the Spalding B-number.

The resulting mass transfer number is normally quoted as shown in

where r is the mass stoichiometric ratio (oxygen (g)/ fuel (g)). The first
term in the numerator represents the heat of combustion per unit mass of
air consumed, i.e., ~3000 J/g [16]. The second term is small and can be
neglected, which means that B reduces to the form of Eq. (2-7):

B =

Equation (2-7) indicates that combustible liquids with low heats of
evaporation (and thus high B values) will tend to burn more rapidly. The
B-numbers  of  a  range  of  liquid  fuels  under  normal  conditions  are
compared in Table 1.

When a horizontal forced flow with a uniform velocity of u is passing
across the fuel surface and the heat flux to the surface is considered to be
dominated by the flux from the flame convection, the burning behavior
in forced-convection atmospheres can be approximated by considering a
burning  longitudinal  surface,  which  involves  gradients  in  both  the  x
direction and the y direction, as shown in Fig. 8 [56].

This basic burning problem can be reduced to the Blasius solution or
an incompressible fluid boundary layer on a flat plate, which takes the
form of the Blasius equation shown in Eq. (2-8):

f ′′′ + ff ′′ = 0,

(2-8)

where f is a modified stream function and the primes designate differ-
entiation with respect to a transformed coordinate. In 1956, Emmons
provided an exact solution for the local burning rate at the position x
along the streamline direction, which can be given in the form of Eq. (2-
9) [58]:

condensed-fuel pool fire and the corresponding diffusion flame repro-
duced  by  the  BRE  burner.  As  the  images  show,  the  sizes,  colors,  and
natures of the flame are very similar in these configurations. These ex-
amples  substantiate  the  proposal  that  matching  of  four  properties  is
sufficient to generate the same burning condition when compared with a
condensed-fuel pool fire.

In  addition  to  Hottel’s  phenomenological  analysis  for  steady-state
burning  as  given  in  Eq.  (2-2),  another  notable  theory  is  Spalding’s

shown in Fig. 9, if the stagnant film has a thickness δ, the free-stream
conditions are believed to exist at a distance ds  from the fuel surface.
The  mass  burning  rate  can  then  be  solved  by  introducing  a  series  of
conserved variables of the ‘b’ number, and because the Prandtl number
and  the  Lewis number are  both assumed  to be unity, the  rate  can be
expressed as [56]:

where λ is the gas phase conductivity, Dd is the diffusion coefficient, and
μ is the dynamic viscosity.

Furthermore when considering a pool fire that is subject to natural
convection, a first approximation of the burning rate can be written as
follows from analogies to heat transfer without mass transfer [56].

where a equal to 1/4 for the laminar condition and 1/3 for turbulent
conditions, Gr is the Grashof number, and dp is the critical dimension of
the pool.

It should be noted here that the original B-number concept can be
applied  to  the  burning  of  liquid  fuels,  if  the  associated  flame  is  non-
luminous  (very  low  emissivity)  and  convection  heat  transfer  is  domi-
nant. When the pool fire size is increased, the burning rate will then be
dominated by heat feedback from the flame radiation. In their current
form, the equations above cannot be used under conditions that involve
significant radiative heat transfer, but they can be modified to take ra-
diation into account. The modified B-number can be expressed as [59]:

increasing "heat blockage" effect [60].

2.2. Scale effects

As shown in Eq. (2.2) and Fig. 5, the relative contribution of each
heat  transfer  path  (i.e.,  conduction,  convection  and  radiation)  are
dependent upon the pool scale. For pool fires in the laminar flame region
(≤7  cm)  with  various  wall  materials  and  thicknesses,  the  heat  trans-
ferred from the vessel wall that is directly conductively heated by the
flame  to  the liquid  is  dominant  over the  radiative  heat flux,  this was
confirmed  by  both  experimental  and  finite-difference  model-based
analytical results [61–64]. Additionally, the thermal structure and the
motion of the liquid phase within the pool must also be characterized,
because  it  in  turn  redistributes  energy  and  affects  the  heat  transfer
process, which then has a further effect on the small-scale pool vapor-
ization. According to the results for non-luminous methanol pool fires on
a small scale, the burning rate at the vessel rim is greater than at the pool
center [65], because of the existence of radial flow [65]. The burning
rate in a 3-cm diameter Pyrex glass pool was governed by the convection
motion within the liquid during the early stage of combustion and by the
lip  height  during  the  later  stage,  which  is  related  to  both  Rayleigh
convection (caused by temperature-induced buoyancy) and Marangoni
convection4  (caused by temperature-induced surface tension gradient)
occurring simultaneously [66]. A stabilized thermal structure known as
a ’hot zone’ [64,67], usually forms below the fuel surface of relatively
deep  pool fires, with the  temperature profile being established in the
liquid depth direction. Surface tension and buoyancy will lead collab-
oratively  to  fluid  motion  that  will  also  influence  the  heat  transfer
mechanism. Both vertical and horizontal convection components exist
within the liquid, which should essentially be two-dimensional in form.
During the period from 2013 to 2015, a series of works of interest
performed by Vali and Larry [55,68,69] demonstrated the redistribution
of  the  energy  that  occurs  within  the  liquid  fuel  in  a  steady-state
small-scale methanol  pool flame with  the aim of  investigating the ef-
fects of the initial fuel thickness and the bounding material temperatures
on the burning rates. The well-defined velocity field within the liquid
was  measured  using  the  advanced  measurement  method  of  particle
image velocimetry (PIV), which first revealed the mixing motion in the
fuel layer. Two main vortices were detected in the top layer: one was
located at the center of the pool, and another vortex was induced by
natural convection close to the rims, while no significant motion was
observed  in  the  lower  region  [55,69]  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  10.  The
counter-rotating vortex pairs ensure that the liquid remains well-mixed,
and thus a near-uniform temperature upper layer forms, while the lower
layer shows a steep temperature gradient associated with relatively slow
ascending velocity caused by  the fuel  level  being maintained [55,69]
(see  Fig.  10).  Their  experimental  results  showed  that  for  a  shallower
pool or a pan with a colder bottom more energy would be demanded by
the change in the liquid sensible energy, while less energy will then be

4  Because surface tension is a decreasing function of temperature for most of
the  liquids  at  most  temperatures,  a  variation  of  thesurface  tension  induces  a
flow on and near the surface of a liquid with non-uniform surface temperature,
which is known as Marangonior thermo-capillary convection.

available for fuel pyrolysis. Therefore, the liquid-phase transport process
and  the  boundary  conditions  are  the  crucial  factors  involved  in
achieving an accurate energy balance for a small-scale pool fire. These
important findings with regard to liquid phase motion and heat transfer
will improve the prediction accuracy of small-scale pool burning rates.
Another important parameter to be considered for small pool fires is
the lip height (which is defined as the vertical distance between the fuel
surface and the vessel’s rim; or namely ullage, freeboard height). Small
pool fire burning rates are sensitive to the lip height on account of the
conduction pathway that is relevant to the non-direct path for radiation
and convection heating of the bounding materials. Some initial findings
were first summarized by Hall in 1972 [31], and showed that a signif-
icant lip height could initiate turbulence at the pool edge that would
enhance the convective heat transfer; this would then change the con-
duction mechanism caused by the gas-phase temperature distribution.
However,  there  have  been  several  different  observations  about  the
relationship between the burning rates and the lip height to date.

Some works in the literature reported that the burning rates rise with
increasing lip height [3,70], but other studies showed that the rates slow
down  with  increasing  lip  height  [3,30,71-73].  In  these  works,  it  was
found that the mass burning rate associated with the various lip heights
are also strongly dependent on the pan’s construction materials, and the
fuel  types  and  thicknesses  [72].  For  vessel  materials  with  poor  heat
conductivity such as glass, the burning rate decreases exponentially with
increasing lip height until it reaches a critical value, when the formation
of flame instability then results in the flame self-quenching phenome-
non. For vessel materials with good heat conductivity, e.g., copper and
mild steel, natural convection influences the mass burning rate strongly
because of the non-negligible heat loss that occurs through the vessel.
Recently,  the  results  of  numerical  simulations  and  experiments  from
investigations of the burning rates of small-scale methanol cavity pool
fires using a copper burner, were compared in [74], showing the trend of
both declining to a local minimum and then increasing with variation of
the mass flux versus a wide range of dimensionless lip heights (0.25D –
2.4D). The minimum mass burning rate value associated with the flame
structure was revealed by the numerical model, which showed that the
minimum rate corresponded to correspond where the condition that the
flame becomes unsteady and anchors around the vessel rim; this con-
dition arises from the flame stand-off phenomenon. In 2021, the latest
reported research with regard to the lip height effect on pool fire (D=10,
15 cm; stainless steel pan) measured the evolution of the heat feedback
[75]; conduction heat feedback was observed to be dominant, and was
enhanced when the lip height increased because it can be regarded as a
perimeter-dependent phenomenon. The study was also found that the
radiation component initially increased and then dropped as a result of
changes in the soot volume fraction or the smoke particulates generation
behavior.  The  convection  component  initially  decreased  and  then
increased with increasing lip height (0–1.4D) because of the variation in
the turbulence intensities. At minor lip heights, the flame base would be
suspended between the upper rim of the pool and the fuel surface with
periodic origination and development of ring vortices [74]; at larger lip
heights,  however,  the  flame  would  enter  further  into  the  pan,  which
then intensified the turbulence intensities (e.g., chaotic vortices occur-
ring inside the pan), and this was consistent with the results reported in
[31].

In contrast to the approach of Eqs. (2-1), and (2-2), which were based
on energy conservation over the liquid surface, Spalding used stagnant
film theory to propose a relation between the burning rate and the pool
diameter using B-number [76,77] in the laminar flow regime (D≤7 cm),
which was based on the assumption that both conduction and convec-
tion occur at the vapor zone, without the effect of radiation.

When the pool diameter increases to the medium-scale, or the ratio
of  the  pool  area  to  the  pool  perimeter  increases,  the  convection
component that is driven by the buoyancy will make up a greater pro-
portion of the heat input to the liquid surface [2,78-84], particularly for
non-luminous flame, e.g., in the absence of any remarkable radiation.
Methanol  fires,  which  have  a  low  soot  fraction  in  their  flames,  were
found  to  have  nearly  constant  burning  rates  when  their  diameters
exceeded 1 m [85]. Therefore, the burning rate may be extrapolated to
be  insensitive  to  the  radial  distance  for  the  case  of  a  fully-turbulent
flame.

For  the  burning  of  a  medium-scale  pool  fire  that  is  dominated  by
convection heat transfer, however, the existence of significant radiation
emission from the flame is more generally observed for most liquid fuels.
The local heat transfer processes, including the radiative heat fluxes to
the  liquid  fuel  surface,  have  been  subject  to  extensive  experimental
characterization because knowledge of these processes is essential for
prediction and validation of the burning rate results [2,30,67,78,82,86].
Models of the time averaged flame shape, temperature and emissivity of
homogeneous flame were used to estimate the radiative heat flux to the
fuel surface for comparison with the measured values reported in rele-
vant works [3,78,87,88]. The fluctuations in the temperature and the
soot concentrations in the spatial distribution of a heterogeneous flame
caused  by  turbulence  [89]  should  also  be  considered  to  form  a  more
detailed model. Several researchers have investigated the local burning
rates or local radiation to the fuel surface using a variety of liquid fuels
(including non-sooty [90], moderately sooty [30,82], and heavily sooty
[78] fuels) and solid polymers such as PMMA [2,88] over a wide range
of scales; however, the results showed diverse variations in the trends for
the local burning rate from the center toward the rim. All these varia-
tions may be ascribed to the experimental configurations used, i.e., the
boundary conditions (fuel-level control, lip height, fuel thickness, and
pan materials), and the nature of the fuels used.

In 1972, based on a one-dimensional vertical mixing model, de Ris
and  Orloff  [91]  proposed  a  dimensional  correlation
for  an
intermediate-scale  burning  pool  in  which  the  heat  feedback  was

dominated by convection by applying the stagnant film concept:

Here,  the  subscripts  ζ  and  γ  represent  one  quarter  of  the  distance
from the fuel surface to the flame and the midway point between the fuel
surface and the flame, respectively. v and μ  are the dynamic viscosity
and the kinematic viscosity, respectively. Although it was found that this
equation  was  unable  to  correlate  the  data  when  B≤1  (i.e.,  in  the
extinction  regime),  the  B  numbers  for  most  liquid  and  solid  fuels  lie
within the range from 1 to 10 (see Table 1). The discrepancies observed
in the extinction regime could be attributed to the chemical kinetic rates,
the effect of stoichiometry on the fluid flow and the transition to laminar
flow. In 1991, Arpaci et al. [92] proposed two models for the fuel con-
sumption rate of laminar and turbulent buoyancy-driven pool fires with
negligible radiation effects in terms of the flame Batchelor scale [92].
Their models led to a 3/4 power law for B in laminar fires and a 2/3
power  law  for  B  in  turbulent  fire,  both  of  which  agree  well  with  Eq.

Other  previous  global  burning  rate  models  were  not  universally
applicable because they required prior knowledge of characteristic pa-
rameters  including  the  flame  shape,  the  effective  equivalent  grey-gas

volume fraction, etc. More recently, the steady burning rates of well-
controlled pool fires for wide ranges of fuels and diameters (0.1–2 m)
have been studied experimentally by Ditch et al. [34], to mitigate the

effects of liquid-phase convection motion, in-depth radiation absorption
and  changes in the fuel composition  caused by distillation. In combi-
nation with a review of the pertinent pool fire studies, the burning rates
measured  in  their  study  showed  good  consistency  with  the  results  of
previous  research.  Finally,  an  empirical  correlation  equation  (Eq.
(2-19)) was developed to predict the mass flux in terms of the heat fluxes
received at the fuel surface for pool greater than 7 cm, this equation is
only dependent on the pool size, the fuel’s heat of gasification, and the
flame sootiness.

between the burning rate of pool fire with diameters of greater than 7 cm
calculated  using  the  Eq.  (2-19)  and  the  measured  burning  rates  as  a
function  of  the  fuel  type.  The  results  obtained  from  Eq.  (2.19)  show
relatively good agreement with the mean absolute error of 29.2%; re-
sults are included for 17 fuels and for pool scales of up to 16 m. Equation

using  PMMA,  in  which  a  steady  burning  state  is  difficult  to  achieve
because of a noticeable in-depth radiation absorption effect.

As the pool diameter increases further, the dominant heat transfer
mode becomes radiation for large, fully turbulent pool fire, in which the
flames can be either optically-thin or optically-thick. Burgess [103] first
pointed out that the burning rates of large pool fires with varying fuel
types  that  are  governed  by  radiation  could  be  represented  by  the
following empirical expression:

When the pool size is greater than 1 m, the resulting large pool fire flame
would  be  optically  thick  [105].  The  production  of  large  quantities  of
soot, particularly in optically-thick large-scale pool fires, is an important
factor that affects the burning rate. Additionally, the heat feedback is
still fuel-dependent within this regime, with obvious differences being
observed between hydrocarbon and alcohol fires. An extensive range of
relevant  observations  have  been  found  in  the  literature  [94,106,
108-116],  including  studies  of  the  radiative  heat  transport  and  inho-
mogeneous heat flux across the pool. More importantly, a thin, cool, and
fuel-rich core region located above the pool surface could attenuate the
radiative feedback to the fuel greatly as a result of a phenomenon that
was named radiative energy blockage by Brosmer [117], and thus the
mass consumption rates were even recorded to show a slight reduction
in some experimental data.

the

thermal

radiation

To date, as a potential continuation of the work following on from
[34], the radiation blockage above the fuel has still not been quantified
when the fuel mass fluxes are being predicted. Suo-Anttila et al. [118]
measured
spectra  of  a  2-m-diameter
well-controlled pool fire using a mid-infrared spectrometer and found
that a remarkable fraction of the thermal radiation (>90% for ethanol
and >75% for JP-8) reaching the fuel surface was absorbed within the
first 3 mm. Additionally, in the upper level of the fire plume, where the
thick black smoke obscures the flames randomly (i.e., where there is a
lower  radiation  loss  fraction  and  lower  emissive  power),  the  smoke
shield brings fuel vapor to the outer surface of the fire, where it can then
be combusted more efficiently under the influence of the turbulent na-
ture of the hot fluid [94,119,120].This non-luminous part of the flame
with intermittent hot spots makes it difficult to calculate the emissive
power not only to the fuel surface, but also to the surroundings for use in
modelling studies [121] (this will be discussed in detail later in Section
4).

proposed by Ditch et al. [34] and measured burning rates; this model applies to
pool  fires  with  diameters  of  more  than  7cm  (using  data  from  [30,34,
83,94-102]).

2.3. Pressure and oxygen effects

The effects of pressure and oxygen effects on the diffusion of gaseous
flames have attracted numerous studies. However, for condensed fuels,
investigations of the pressure and oxygen effects upon the combustion
and  burning  processes  were  relatively  limited.  Generally,  the  oxygen
concentration participates in the chemical kinetics, having an obvious
and  direct  effect  on  the  gas-phase  combustion  process,  while  the  air

with diameters greater than 0.2 m (using data from [30,34,83,94-96,99,106]), and (b) Burgess, which applies to pool fires with diameters larger than 1 m (using data
from [32,96]).

pressure  has  a  significant  effect  on  the  pressure-dependent  chemical
process,  and  it  also  plays  an  important  role  in  the  buoyant  turbulent
physical activities that affect local heat transfer during the liquid-phase
evaporation process, along with the air entrainment and fuel-air mixing.
Ambient conditions including the pressure and the oxygen environ-
ment have been proven to have significant influences on the fuel com-
bustion behavior and burning characteristics, particularly in fires taking
place  in  high-altitude  areas,  e.g.,  the  Qinghai-Tibet  Plateau  in  China,
and  the  Alps  in  Europe,  along  with  fires  in  aircraft  and  submarines.
Unlike the normal pressure conditions, lower or higher pressure condi-
tions have significant effects on the fire dynamics, the flame morphology
and the combustion products that will further influence fire prevention
and  mitigation,  and  thus  global  interest  in  this  subject  has  arisen  in
recent years.

The flame morphology, which includes the flame shape (e.g., width,
height and length), pulsation and luminance, plays an important role in
fire hazard analysis. Because soot formation is reduced in association
with a lower soot yield at high altitudes, which is primarily attributed to
the lower oxygen density, the flame brightness decays significantly in
this  case,  as  confirmed  by  the  experimental  observation  of  pool  fires
performed in Lhasa, Tibet (65.0 ± 1.5 kPa) (see Fig. 13). In contrast, the

flame becomes brighter at pressure higher than the normal pressure (≈ 1
atm) [122]. Therefore, the change in soot formation enables alteration
of radiation heat feedback received by the fuel surface, and thus alters
the pool fire burning rate.

The pressure also influences the scale effects of the burning rates of
pool fires. In 1961, the effects of reduced pressure (down to 0.04 atm) on
the liquid fuel diffusion flames were investigated by Hirst [124]. They
found that fuel regression/burning rate v (units: ml/min) of isododecane
with four pool dimensions (ranging from 2.8–9.6 cm) was proportional
to  P0.46.  Wieser’s  study  [125]  went  further  by  investigating  full-scale
pool  fire  tests  under  low  pressure  conditions,  where  EN54  standard
fire tests were performed at four different altitudes (420, 1000, 1800,
and 3030 m) in a mobile test platform. The burning rates of n-heptane
and polyurethane pool fires were investigated experimentally to verify
′′∝PA, where A = 2/3 – 4/3. This power law
the possible correlation of   ̇m
relationship was confirmed by more recent works [35,36,123,125-131],
where the exponent A was found to be dependent on the pool diameter,
as summarized in Table 3.

As  mentioned  earlier,  the  heat  balance  of  fuel  burning  can  be
expressed using Eq. (2-2), where three regions with different dominant
heat  mechanisms  were  identified  with  the  increasing  pool  size.  This
scale  effect  is  consistent  with  the  previous  identified  region  for
conduction-controlled  burning  (fuel  equivalent  diameter  D  < 7  cm),
convection-controlled  burning  (10  cm  < D  < 20  cm),  and  radiation-
controlled burning (D > 20 cm) [83].

burning rate with increasing pool fire scale was formulated based on a
combination of experimental observations and radiation fire modeling
theory by Tu et al. [37], as shown in Eq. (2-22) and illustrated in Fig. 14,
which also includes results for a polyurethane solid fuel pool fire [133].
It should be noted that in some cases in the conduction-controlled region
for small pan pool fires, because of the slightly higher flame temperature
caused by the reduced soot radiation loss, the burning rate under lower
air pressure conditions may be strengthened in association with a higher
heat release rate. This indicates that the early fire in high plateau areas
could pose a greater threat, and thus the fire hazard evaluation method
and detection algorithm should be improved and modified accordingly.
However,  for  pool  fires  in  relatively  large-sized  pans,  the  lower  soot
production  in  the  radiation-controlled  region  leads  to  lower  flame
emissivity, which mitigates the increasing effect of the flame tempera-
ture on the radiation heat feedback, and thus the burning rate under low
air pressure conditions generally remains lower.

Additionally, apart from considerations of the pan size, rectangular
pool fires under conduction-controlled and radiation-controlled condi-
tions were investigated by Fang [35] and Hu [36], respectively, with
regard to the pan shape. The hydraulic diameter, which is defined as
rh*=2wl/(w+l) was proposed to deal with changes in the aspect ratio
change,  where  w  and  l  represent  the  burner’s  width  and  length,
respectively.

Furthermore,  for  aircraft  operation  during  flight,  the  cargo
compartment,  which  may  contain  a  variety  of  combustible  materials,
often  experiences  dynamic  pressure  changes  (pressurization  and
depressurization),  non-conservation  of  oxygen,  and  unidirectional
ventilation.  Pool  fire  experiments  were  also  performed  [134]  in  a
large-scale pressure chamber under dynamic pressure change conditions
with  various  depressurization  rates,  where  the  burning  rates  of  a
34-cm-diameter  n-heptane  pool  fire  were  measured  under  dynamic
pressure  conditions  with  various  increasing  pressure  rates  (from  100

Note that the exponent in this case is nearly the same as that obtained
from pressure modelling theory by de Ris [135]. When the air pressure is
higher  than  that  under  normal  conditions,  fires  can  also  occur  in
super-ambient  pressurized  compartments,  e.g.,  compartments
in
deep-sea submersibles and nuclear containment shells during pressur-
ized periods [136,137]. To investigate the effects of high pressure on fire
behavior, studies of ethanol pool fires using 1.5-cm and 2.0-cm-diameter
glass vessels were performed over a wide pressure range from 1–5 atm
by Chen et al. [138]. Their results showed that the high pressure affected
the  heat  transfer  and  flame  characteristics  of  the  small-scale  ethanol
pool  fires  significantly.  As  the  pressure  increased,  the  flame  became
more luminous because of the stronger effect of the pressure on the soot
formation reaction rate (~ P2 [139]), and it also became more turbulent
because  of  the  enhanced  buoyancy  effect,  i.e.  Gr  ~  P2D3.  The  fuel
burning  rate  initially  decreased  slightly  and  then  increased  consider-
ably. The first slight reduction in the rate was due to the lower boiling
temperature, i.e., by the lower value of the conduction heat feedback
 ̇q
con, while the increase in the burning rate at higher pressure can be
attributed to the enhanced natural convection and flame radiation.

In these previous studies of the air pressure effects on pool fires, the
air  pressure  was  varied  while  the  oxygen  volume  fraction  was  main-
tained  at  almost  the  same  value  of  21%.  The  individual  effect  of  the
oxygen concentration on pool fire behavior is highly important in some
fire scenarios, e.g., in the high oxygen concentration environments that
frequently  exist  in  space  flight  operations  and  industrial  processes
[140], while a reduced oxygen concentration would exist under many
confined compartment fire conditions when the oxygen is consumed. In
1981, Tewarson et al. [59] studied the oxygen concentration effect using
pool fires with areas of approximately 0.007 and 0.07 m2 and condensed
fuels  that  contained  methanol,  heptane,  polyformaldehyde  (POM),
polypropylene (PP), PMMA and polystyrene (PS). The burning rate, the
flame radiative heat flux, and soot formation were all found to increase
and the flame convective heat flux decreased when Yo2,∞  was increased.
Chen et al. [43] investigated the effect of the oxygen concentration on
the  entire  pool  fires  burning  process  at  pressures  below  1  atm.
Small-scale  pool  fire  tests  using  n-heptane  and  ethanol  with  different
diameters were conducted with various oxygen volume concentrations
ranging from 15% to 27%. Because increasing the oxygen concentration
within  a  certain  range  would  produce  positive  feedback  on  the

conductive, convective and radiant heat fluxes, the mean burning rate of
small-scale pool fires will increase significantly with increasing oxygen
concentration, which is consistent with the results reported in [59].

Wang et al. [141] investigated the mass burning rate under various
initial oxygen concentrations the were lower than the ambient concen-
tration, using diesel pool fire in a confined space. The residual fuel mass
and the fuel extinction time both increased with decreasing Yo2,∞ . When
compared with the open space conditions with a constant oxygen mass
fraction, the mass burning rate decreases as initial oxygen mass fraction

2.4. Wind effects

One factor that is common to all fires that occur in the open is wind.
Pool  fire  burning  under  wind-free  conditions  is  driven  solely  by  the
natural convection induced by buoyant flow, and the air entrainment
and fuel-air mixing are also purely buoyancy-dominated. However, the
pool fire’s symmetrical burning behavior (including the flame geometry,
vortice structure, air entrainment, and heat transfer processes) becomes
asymmetrical when the fire is subjected to wind in an outdoor area, as
illustrated  in  Fig.  15,  which  is  a  more  complex  but  entirely  practical
issue. Under the action of the wind, the pool fire burning behavior will
be affected jointly by the buoyancy and the incoming wind inertial force.
When  the  flame  is  tilted  in  a  pronounced  manner,  the  heat  transfer
mechanisms  (e.g.,  conduction,  convection,  and  radiation)  alter  corre-
spondingly under the mixed convection conditions, along with the fuel-
air  mixing  process.  The  attendant  tilted  flame  length,  flame  sag,  and
flame base drag all have dramatic impacts on the amount of energy that
is transferred to the fuel surface. In addition, the soot production and
radiation  properties  may  also  be  changed  under  wind  because  of  the
variations in the turbulence characteristic length scales and the associ-
ated time scales. For example, the conduction feedback through the side
walls  is  normally  symmetrical.  Under  windy  conditions,  the  leading
edge  of  the  wall  will  be  cooled  by  the  incoming  wind,  whereas  the
trailing edge of the wall will possibly be heated more vigorously by the
downwash flame or by the deflected flame radiation. The natural con-
vection  will  gradually be  overwhelmed  by  wind  forced  convection  in
this  case,  which  may  then  result  in  more  intensive  convective  heat
transfer  to  the  fuel  surface  because  of  the  change  in  the  thermal
boundary layer thickness. Radiative feedback would also decrease as the
flame tilted to greater angles because of the smaller geometrical view
factor. Therefore, the changeable heat feedback leads to a change in the
burning rate, which is complex and is strongly dependent on the scale of
the pool, the fuel types involved, and other factors.

The burning rate evolution trend of small- to medium-scale pool fires
with increasing wind speed is by no means supported universally by the
experimental data in the literature. These inconsistent change trends in
the burning rate can be attributed to the variations in aspects such as the
boundary materials, the initial fuel depth, the fuel type, the fuel-level
maintenance conditions, the wind turbulence intensity, and the pan’s
leading edge boundary layer separation.

Within  the  small  diameter  limit  (<0.2  m),  Babrauskas  [105]
considered  the  convective  heat  transfer  enhancement  to  be  the  main
effect that influenced the burning rate. Blinov and Khudyakov [30] re-
ported the effects of airflow on liquid burning in medium-scale pools
with diameters ranging from 0.15 to 0.5 m. Tractor kerosene, diesel oil
and heavy fuel oil were used as the fuels in their work, which indicate
the following behavior:

where v is the fuel consumption volume rate divided by the fuel surface
area (units: mm/min), i.e., fuel regression/burning rate, under windy

conditions, v0 is the fuel regression/burning rate in still air, β’  is a scale
factor  and  u  is  the  wind  velocity.  The  fuel  burning  rate  increased  by
30–40% when u increased from 0 to 3 m/s except for the heavy oil case,
which was believed to be related to improved mixing at the flame base
and  higher  combustion  efficiency  that  produce  higher  radiative  in-
tensity.  Based  on  the  results  reported  in  [30],  Eq.  (2-26)  was  then
derived [105] to give:

noted that the equation above was obtained before the flame was blown-
off, and it is not appropriate for use with alcohol fuels. In addition, the
maximum  wind  velocity  (u)  was  extended  to  25  m/s  in  Blinov  and
Khudyakov’s report [30], at which the burning rate reaches an asymp-
totic limit. This indicates that a critical wind speed exists, beyond which
the wind will have little additional effect on the burning rate. In 1966,
Welker  et  al.  [142]  performed  experiments  using  circular  pans  (from
0.1–0.61 m in diameter) with various fuels (methanol, acetone, n-hex-
ane, cyclohexane, benzene) at wind speeds ranging up to 2.1 m/s, and
found  that  the  burning  rates  all  showed  a  declining  trend,  with  the
exception of methanol. Yumoto [108] found that the burning rate of a
0.6 m hexane pool fire was 1.5 times greater in wind at 4 m/s when
compared with the corresponding rate under quiescent conditions, but
the  rate  then  remained  invariant  with  further  increases  in  the  wind
speed. Woods et  al.  [13] studied the wind  effects  (speeds  from 0–5.5
m/s) on the burning rates of square methanol pool fires with side lengths
ranging from 7.5 to 30 cm. Depending on the pan sizes used, the burning
rates  increased  monotonically  for  the  7.5  and  10  cm  pool,  changed
non-monotonically (rising initially, then dropping, and then becoming
basically invariant) for the 15 and 20 cm pools, and stayed invariant for
the 30 cm pool. Weckman et al. [143] also observed the non-monotonic
change trend for a 0.3 m acetone pool fire that was subjected to wind.
More recently, additional fuels were used to enable further examination
of the burning rates of small- to-intermediate-scale pool fires (<1 m) in
windy conditions, including aviation fuel [144], n-heptane and ethanol,
gasoline  [14,98,99,145],  acetone  [100],  and  biodiesel  oil  [146–148];
the  results  showed  that  the  burning  rates  of  these  pool  fires  showed
similarly  non-monotonic  responses  with  increasing  wind  speeds.
Furthermore,  it  was  also  found  that  the  burning  rates  changed
non-monotonically  with  wind  speeds  ranging  up  to  4.5  m/s  [99]  for
optically-thin  square  pool  fires  (side  length:  0.25–0.7  m)  when  using
n-heptane as the fuel. This was interpreted based on the complex change
controlling  mechanisms  between  the  heat  feedback  and  the  aero-
dynamic  extinction  at  the  leading  edge  related  to  the  Damk ̈ohler
number.

As summarized above, the underlying heat feedback mechanism on
the  fuel  surface  obviously  changes  in  windy  conditions.  Only  a  few
studies  have  addressed  the  variations  in  the  relative  contributions  of
each heat feedback component quantitatively. Hu et al. [98] identified
the reduction in the burning rates (mass flux) with increasing pool size at
certain  wind  speeds  in  the  range from  1.1  to  3.1  m/s  using  5–25  cm
gasoline pool fires in 2011. Their results showed a different trend from
the classical scale effect developed by Blinov et al. [30] in still air, where
the burning rate ascends with increasing diameter in the corresponding
regime (i.e., the transition regime; see Fig. 5). In 2013, Hu et al. [14]
quantified the evolution of the radiative heat feedback of ethanol and
n-heptane pool fires (10–25 cm) experimentally at wind speeds of up to
3  m/s.  They  found  that  the  overall  incident  radiation  heat  feedback
decays significantly when the flame is deflected by the wind. The rela-
tive  decay  in  the  feedback  was  found  to  be  greater  for  n-heptane
(50–70%) than for ethanol (25–35%). Next, in 2015, the evolution of the
heat feedback fractions (i.e., conduction, convection, and radiation) for
10–25 cm ethanol and n-heptane pool fires in wind at speeds ranging

from  0–3.0  m/s  were  measured  [145].  The  results  showed  that  the
overall increment in the conduction heat feedback fraction due to the
wind effect was greater for smaller pans, and this increment was more
prominent for the n-heptane pool fire, with an increase rate that was
nearly two times that of the ethanol fire. The radiative heat feedback
decreased with increasing wind speed, until it became negligible as the
wind  speed  increased  further.  The  convective  heat  feedback  was
enhanced remarkably with increasing wind speeds; this was especially
evident for sootier flames (i.e., from n-heptane) and larger-scale pools,
and  it  became  the  dominant  heat  feedback  mechanism  when  Fr  was
greater than unity, as shown in Fig. 16(a). As mentioned earlier, in the
transition regime (see Fig. 5), the dominant heat feedback mechanisms
transitioned  from  convection  to  radiation  in  still  air,  and  thus  the
burning rate increased gradually with the stronger radiative heat flux.
However, the radiative heat flux to the fuel surface dropped off, while
both  the  conductive  heat  feedback  and  the  convective  heat  feedback
were enhanced in the presence of relatively strong wind.

Because  of  these  changes  in  the  prominent  heat  feedback  mecha-
nisms, the equation for the mass flux of diffusion burning in a liquid pool
should be re-considered. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the wind-blown pool
fire’s burning rate was quantified in relation to the pool size based on the
stagnant  layer  theory  solution  when  convective  heat  feedback  is  pre-
dominant (Fr>1); this is deemed to be a two-dimensional forced-con-
vection  boundary  layer  diffusion  combustion  problem.  The  pool  fire
mass burning flux for various fuel properties, pool sizes, and wind speeds
within certain ranges can be formulated well using the following pro-
posed function (see Fig. 16(b)):

where χconv  is the convection heat feedback fraction and B/χconv  is the

Recent  developments  have  been  reported  on  determination  of  the
combined  effects  of  wind  speed  (0–3  m/s)  and  lip  height  (h*  = h/D,
0.25–2) on the regression rates of moderate-scale pool fires (5-20 cm)
[149]. It was found that the burning rate responses differed with respect
to the lip height and pool size values with increased wind speed. For
relatively  small  pools (D  = 5  and  10 cm),  the  burning rate increased
monotonically  when  h*  was  small,  while  the  burning  rate  initially
decreased and then increased for larger h* values with increased wind
speed. However, for the relatively large pools (D = 15 and 20 cm) with
small h*, the burning rate initially increased and then decreased with
increasing wind speed. Additionally, a flame ‘push-down’ phenomenon
was observed via numerical simulations under strong wind speed con-
ditions, and this altered the heat feedback mechanism. Furthermore, a
general  correlation  was  developed  to  quantify  the  mass  burning  flux
under the coupled effects of the lip height (h) and the wind speed (u),

 ̇m′′ = (0.1u + 0.97)exp[ (cid:0) (2.56u + 2.65)h].

For pool fires with larger diameters (≥ 1 m), burning experiments
involving  these  large-scale  fires  are  related  directly  to  practical  fire
scenarios  that  occur  outdoors.  The  variation  in  the  burning  rates  of
large-scale  turbulent  pool  fires  with  increasing  wind  speed  that  have
been reported in the literature demonstrate conflicting results. The un-
steady  nature  of  ambient  wind,  which  includes  spatial  and  temporal
variation in the ambient wind speed, the wind direction and the envi-
ronmental  conditions  (e.g.,  ambient  temperature,  relative  humidity,
atmospheric pressure) would have a considerable impact on large-scale
pool fire tests performed under a considerable poorly controlled outdoor
conditions,  thus  affecting  the  accuracy  and  repeatability  of  the  mass
burning rates data.  The physical properties  of  the individual fuel  can
also cause changes in the burning rates. Additionally, the presence of a
water layer underneath the fuel layer also has a major impact on the
burning rates of large-scale pool fires under windy conditions. Some of
the previous large pool fire tests were conducted by placing a prescribed
amount  of  the  fuel  above  a  water  layer,  while  other  tests  involved
pouring the fuel directly into the pan. The interchange of heat between
the fuel layer and the water sublayer caused by the liquid-phase motion
may also potentially influences the fuel evaporation behavior. In addi-
tion, the evaporating water vapor has both chemical and thermal effects
on soot production in the type of optically-thick pool fires in which the
flame is soot-saturated [150].

Lois et al. [151] performed tests with a 1 m diameter hexane pool fire
at wind speeds ranging from 0 to nearly 12 m/s in 1978, and observed
that the burning rates approximately doubled at wind speeds from 2 to 4
m/s, but nearly leveled-off when u exceeded 4 m/s. In agreement with
the results reported by Lois et al., burning rates were also observed to
increase firstly and then level off with the increased wind speed of up to
18 m/s for 7–20 m RP-5 aviation fuel and diesel oil pool fires when using
a well-controlled open jet wind tunnel [96]. In 2001, Chatris et al. [95]
also observed that the fuel regression rates of 4-m-diameter diesel oil
and gasoline pool fires rose with increasing wind speeds. Gritzo et al.
[152] studied a 20 m JP-8 jet fuel pool fire and found that the burning
rate  shown  an  increasing  trend  with  wind  speed.  Based  on  measure-
ments in a wind tunnel, more recent advances in testing of a 2 m Jet-A
fuel pool fire in wind ranging from 3-10 m/s were reported by Weckman
et al. [153–155], who found that an increase in wind speed led to an
increase in the burning rate when a false floor was in place (i.e., a floor
installed  in  front  of  the  pan).  However,  no  apparent  variation  was
observed  without  the  false  floor  in  place.  Nonetheless,  there  is  con-
trasting  evidence  that  indicates  that  burning  rates  show  a  decreasing
trend with increasing wind speeds for large-scale pool fires. Apte et al.
[156] reported that the burning rate of 1–2 m aviation fuel pool fires
decreased as the flame was tilted away from the fuel surface by wind

speeds  in  the  0.5  to  2  m/s  range.  In  experiments  using  JP-5  jet  fuel,
Capener et al. [157] reported decreasing burning rate for 1 m and 3 m
pool  fires  with  increasing  wind  speeds.  They  clarified  that  the  mass
burning rate decreased more strongly on the leeward side than on the
windward side by careful examinations of their measurement.

Essentially, the burning rate of large-scale pool fire is a function of
the heat transfer from the flame. On the one hand, the wind effect will
enhance the heat feedback to the fuel surface. On the other hand, the
wind may also inhibit pool burning. Because of the change in the flame
geometry  (i.e., flame  bending) caused  by  the wind,  the heat flux  dis-
tribution across the fuel surface would be altered at higher wind speeds
because of the decreasing view factor.

Under forced flow conditions, more fresh air is entrained, with better

fuel-air mixing occurring in particular at the pool leading edge, which
then results in an increase in the combustion efficiency. This will serve
to reduce black smoke formation, which will consequently increase the
surface emissive power. For a large-scale pool fire, a low temperature,
highly absorbing fuel cone region exists above the fuel surface that will
attenuate  radiation  considerably.  Better  mixing  and  more  complete
combustion  due  to  the  wind  will  also  reduce  the  size  of  this  oxygen-
starved region, thus leading to a weaker radiation blockage effect. The
flame temperature is also elevated as a result of the enhanced turbulent
mixing on the windward side, as confirmed by the results of field testing
of a 18.9 m JP-8 jet fuel pool [158]. Because more smoke was observed
on the leeside, the dense smoke that is observed above the fuel surface is
gradually minimized when the wind speed increases. Enhanced air-fuel

Y. Chen et al.

mixing and flame temperature can also be caused by different types of
vortices  (e.g.,  counter-rotating  vortex  pairs)  or  fire  whirls  [159,160]
caused  by  the  interaction  between  the  upward  convective  current
generated by the fire and the ambient airflow, which leads to an increase
in the convective heat flux. The ambient airflow is believed to intensify
the convective mass transfer of the fuel vapor near the fuel surface on the
windward side.

The heat flux received by the liquid fuel surface will be cooled by the
ambient airflow. Additionally, wind effects also affect the flame insta-
bility. When the surrounding airflow speed increases, the characteristic
diffusion  time  scale  then  decreases.  When  a  critical  wind  speed  is
reached,  the  supplies  of  the  fuel  and  the  oxidant  cannot  sustain  the
chemical reaction (i.e., the Damk ̈ohler number Da decreases), and flame
extinction then occurs at the pool’s leading edge [150], and this results
in reduced fuel evaporation. These positive effects and negative effects
on the burning rates coexist, which means that the large-scale pool fire
burning process under windy conditions is highly complex and requires
further investigation.

When compared with the numbers of small- to moderate-scale tests,
only limited numbers of large-scale pool fire tests have been conducted,
with some of these tests being performed in the field. It will be important
to perform more large-scale tests indoors in well-instrumented facilities
to  simulate  the  physics  of  the  large  pool  fire  burning  behavior  fully.
Additionally, more large-scale pool fire tests (> 3 m) will be required to
understand whether an asymptotic burning rate occurs under crosswind,
as described in [96], to allow the effects of radiative energy blockage
[117] and thick black smoke to be considered.

3. Air entrainment and flame morphological characteristics

3.1. Air entrainment

3.1.1. Free boundary condition

The vertical movement of the fire plume entrains air from the sur-
rounding ambient atmosphere by turbulent mixing of an otherwise un-
restricted and calm atmosphere, and this process determines the thermal
characteristics of the fire plumes [16,33,161]. The air entrainment flow
field, which is an essential factor to shape a fire plume that determines
the pool fire evolution, is governed by the incompressible flow resulted
from  the  baroclinic  vorticity  generation  [162].  Excessive  air  entrain-
ment  exists  for  all  pool  fire  plumes,  it  not  only  determines  the  flame
geometry and the mass burning rate by sustaining fuel combustion, but
also  contributes  to  progressive  expansion  of  the  rising  smoke  volume
above the flame into the far field because of the dilution effect of the cool
air. Therefore, three fundamental aspects are closely associated with the
air entrainment process of a pool fire: i) air entrainment of the flame
region,  ii)  far-field  air  entrainment  and  iii)  an  excess  entrainment
fraction.

Many  different  techniques  have  been  used  to  measure  the  air
entrainment rate of pool fire plume as summarized in [162,163]. In the
visible flame region, the available air entrainment correlations suggest
that  the  plume  mass  flux  depends  on  the  source  size  and  the  flame
height.  The  air  entrainment  volumetric  flow  can  be  defined  by  the
product of the flame surface envelope Ae  and the air entrainment ve-
locity Ue, i.e.,   ̇ment ∼ ρ∞UeAe [164–166]. Due to the oscillating nature of
a pool fire, the flame surface envelope varies along the flame height, and
this envelop can be divided into three regimes [166] as shown in Fig. 17:
the regime close to the pool surface, the regime within the neck-in area

permission of Elsevier).

and the regime further downstream. Therefore, the area that is available
for  entrainment  within  the  flame  area  is  given  as  follows:  (1)  in  the
regime  close  to  the  pool  surface,Ae ∼ D2;  (2)  in  the  regime  near  the
neck-in  area,Ae ∼ DZ;  and  (3)  in  the  regime  further  downstream,
Ae ∼ Z2. For buoyant flames, the air entrainment velocity is proportional
to the buoyancy accelerated uprising flow velocity∼
. Finally, the
following air entrainment mass flow rate functions are proposed for the
three corresponding regimes as shown in Eq. (3-1) [166]:

This theory takes the fire source dimensions and the fuel properties
into consideration and has been validated by experimental results ac-
quired using laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) flow measurements [163,
167,168]: the  axial  and radial  averaged  velocities were shown in  the
form of a vector plot to present the flow patterns, which consisted of
both outward and inward instantaneous motion of air in combination
with recirculation. The outward motion was driven by expansion and
the inward motion was induced by the vorticity produced by the density
gradient.  Additionally,  the  normalized  air  entrainment,  which  incor-
porated Frf, was correlated well with Z/D. It was also noted that Eq. (3-1)
could provide a method to estimate the visible flame heights together

the aspect ratio of the source length l to the width w is relatively large,
the  fire  plume  can  again  be  divided  into  three  regimes  based  on

the far-field air entrainment rate, which were all primarily functions of

sented by the plume mass flow rate if the relatively small mass flow rate

(where Z0  is the offset from the pool), and the formula is incorporated
into Eq. (3-5) [164]

Moreover,  flame  air  entrainment  rate  formulations  that  provide
continuous  coverages  of  the  three  regimes  described  above  [104,
164-166,170] were established. Quintiere et al. [104] noted that the fire
plume  generally  expands  from  the  flame  base  along  the  centerline.
Consequently,  the  fire  plume  width  b  can  then  be  treated  as  a  linear
function of the height Z by neglecting the influence of the neck-in and

Cl=0.199 for rectangular fire sources, and Cl=0.444 for line fire sources;
these  values  represent  the  air  entrainment  strength.  Therefore,  the
following equation for the air entrainment is obtained [104]:

For  the  regime  located  far  away  from  the  fire  source,  the  plume
properties are independent of both the initial conditions at the flame tip

The entrainment predictions indicate that the entrainment rates in
the far-field plume region above the visible flame are correlated well
with  the  point-source  plume  entrainment  model  when  using  an
entrainment rate correction factor and accounting for the virtual origin

Equation (3-7) agrees with the buoyant plume theories from (Eqs. (3-

between the temperature rise and the plume velocity.

Furthermore, another empirical correlation was proposed for the far-
field  region  above  the  flame  by  Heskestad  [178],  based  on  similarity

Fig. 19 compares the predictions of Eq. (3-5) and Eq. (3-8) using the
plume mass flow rate results presented by Cetegen et al. [164]. Although
the  predictions  show  considerable  scatter,  Eq.  (3-8)  appears  to  give
better agreement with the experimental data from [16] when compared
with the predictions from Eq. (3-5).

The turbulent flame structure contributes to a delay in the mixing of
the entrained air with the combustible fuel vapor, which is known as
“unmixedness”. Therefore, the excess entrainment fraction is defined to
describe how much air is entrained when compared with the air (oxy-
gen) required for stoichiometric combustion:

values and plume width.

The  action  of  over-entrained  air  in  diluting  and  cooling  the  fire
plume will further influence both the flame temperature and soot for-
mation. Various values for the air entrainment unmixedness number (n)
have been reported in the literature, and Table 4 summarizes these re-
ported values of n. A value roughly 12 times that of the stoichiometric
air  at  the  flame  tip  was  deduced  in  [179]  from  the  temperature  and
velocity profiles of Yokoi [180], but at the same time, the number was
also found to be approximately 20 times the stoichiometric requirement
by using point measurement techniques coupled to an integral model of
the fluid dynamics behavior. Steward [181] and Koseki [182] proposed
that the ratio could be taken to be 5 based  on an exact solution to a
mathematical model. Using the k (cid:0) ε  (cid:0)
g model, an n value of 9 was
proposed in [183]. When using the hood collection technique, Zukoski
[184] proposed that n was 15. However, Beyler [185] also measured the
air entrainment rate using the hood technique and proposed that n was
approximately  13.  Heskestad  [178]  proposed  n  was  12  based  on
Zukoski’s data about air entrainment at the flame tip. Delichatsios and
Orloff [169] found that the number was 10 and this number was used
directly to derive flame height correlations [166].

Quintiere  and  Grove  [176]  found  that  n  was  9.6  for  both
axi-symmetric  and  linear  plumes,  and  in  their  numerical  simulation
work  in  [186],  the  number  was  found  to  be  approximately  10  for

differentials can be attributed to both the fuel properties and the mea-
surement approaches that were used. More systemic investigations with
regard to this problem would be welcome in the near future.

3.1.2. Confined condition

The air entrainment of the fire plume varies under bounded condi-
tions because the turbulent structure of the plume can be changed by
nearby obstacle, and the exchange of combustible gas and air is confined
simultaneously [16,104,166,190,191], which then leads to the further
changes in the pool fire dynamics, including the mass burning rate, the
flame  shape,  the  thermal  characteristics,  and  the  soot  formation
behavior. It was also reported that the mass flow rate of the entrained air
was reduced considerably on the near-wall side [192], and the direc-
tional momentum of the inflowing entrained air is likely to flatten the
fire plume along the vertical wall surface, thus essentially changing the
heat flux [193]. Because the flame height is inversely related to the air
entrainment rate, pool fires under bounded condition commonly have
taller flame heights.

The typical geometrical constraint scenarios are a pool fire near a
wall [194,195], and a pool fire in a corner. The different pool fire shapes
have the effect of causing differences in the air entrainment behavior.
For a circular burner, it was found that for the same heat release rate, the
total amount of air entrainment of a wall-attached fire is approximately
0.97 times that of a free fire, with the fire plume’s centerline slightly
approaching  the  wall.  This  means  that  the  difference  in  the  excess
entrainment  fraction n  between these two  fire scenarios  is  negligible.
However,  for  a  wall-attached  fire  with  a  semi-circular  geometry  (i.e.

where half the pan blocked off), it was reported that the air entrainment
was approximately 0.57 times that of a free fire with the same diameter
as the semi-circular burner [171]. The mirror model is the most classical
methodology  for  use  in  the  characterization  of  wall-attached  fires,  as
illustrated in Fig. 20 [190], in which the presence of an imaginary fire
source with the same heat intensity as the actual fire source is assumed.
The entrainment rate is proportional to the cube root of the heat release
rate  in  this  model  [184].  Therefore,  the  reduced  entrainment  rate  is
expected to be multiplied by a factor of 0.5×(2)1/3=0.63 according to

the mirror model, which is close to the reported value of 0.57. Zhang
et  al.  [196]  recently  investigated  a  wall-attached  fire  plume  with  a
rectangular fire source and found that the flame height fluctuations of
wall-attached fire plume were weaker than those of the free fire plume,
which means lower total air entrainment is required for a wall-attached
fire. On the one hand, turbulence is inhibited for the wall-attached fire;
on  the  other  hand,  experimental  observations  indicate  that  the
large-scale  vertex  size  for  pockets  of  flame  of  the  free-burning  fire  is
greater than the corresponding size for a wall-attached fire, which in-
dicates stronger local mixing effectiveness (i.e., a lower unmixedness n)
in the latter case.

Zhang et al. [198] then proceeded to study the transition behavior of
near-wall fires at various distances. A dimensionless fire-wall distance
was  used  to  account  for  the  change  in  the  effective  air  entrainment,
particularly  at the  wall side. They  found that the  flame height  at the
lowest  touching-wall  point  Zf,t  increased,  while  the  flame  height  Lf
decreased  when  the  fire-wall  distance  was  increased.  In  physics,  the
entrained airflow from the free side pushes the fire, causing it to tilt and
approach  the  wall  owing  to  the  asymmetry  of  the  air  entrainment.
Fig.  21  illustrates  the  three  conditions  that  occur  at  various  fire-wall
distances  when  the  air  entrainment  condition  is  altered.  Driven  by
both the flame buoyancy Fb∝Δρf gL3
0  and the horizontal inertial force Fi∝

From a fluid mechanics perspective, the changes in the flow struc-
tures (e.g., vorticities, velocities) are responsible for the air entrainment
differences in these two cases (i.e., near-wall fire, and free fire), where
the existence of the wall alters the generation of both the vorticity and
the entrained air. Jangi et al. [199] simulated a pool fire in a compart-
ment by performing a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with the stochastic
fields (SF) method, as shown in Fig. 22(a1)(b1). Two scenarios were set,
where the pool fire was located in open space or near wall. In the first
case, the excess entrained air (20 times, as suggested by McCaffrey and
Cox [188]) causes the fire plume to quench and re-ignite. The second
largest eigenvalue λ2 was then used to identify the core structure of the
vortice [199]. For the pool fires in open space, crosswise vortices were
the dominant features. However, when the pool fire was close enough to
the wall, the crosswise vortices then changed significantly into longi-
tudinal vortices near the wall region. As illustrated in Fig. 22 (a2)(b2),
Zhang et al. [196] performed LES simulation using the Fire Dynamics
Simulator (FDS) to capture the flow field details. It was observed that
vortices only exist on the free side of a wall-attached fire, while vortices
appeared symmetrically on both sides of the free-fire plume. To quantify
the  air  entrainment  behavior  under  bounded  conditions,  the  entrain-
ment factor (EF) was defined as the ratio of the air entrainment into a
bounded fire plume to that into an unbounded fire plume. Zukoski [184]
conducted  experiments  using  square  pools  with  a  vertical  wall,  indi-
cating that the entrainment factor was 0.57 in their case. In addition,
according to the mirror model [171,190], the entrainment factor of a
wall  fire  is  equal  to  0.5×2y.  Here,  y  is  1/3  [200].  Therefore,  the
entrainment factor for wall-attached fires is 0.63.

Another  important  scenario  for  confined  condition  is  a  fire  in  a
corner, as shown in Fig. 20 (b). In the case of the corner fire configu-
ration, a square fire with side length D can be deemed to be one quarter

[102,203,204]).

of an actual fire with a side length of 2D. As for the case of a circular fire
in the corner, the fire plume is close to one quarter of a complete circular
pool  with  four  times  the  heat  release  rate  [201],  and  the  fire  plume
parameters  such  as  the  flame  height  will  change  in  a  corresponding
manner. According to the mirror model discussed in [184,200], the air
entrainment factor (EF) for corner fires is 0.4×(41/3) or 0.40. Recently,
Zeinali et al. [197] conducted experiments on a triangular fire source in
a  corner  and  found  that  use  of  the  mirror  model  resulted  in  over-
estimation of the mean flame height when the side lengths of the triangle
were used as a characteristic scale. They thus obtained a new correlation
that agreed well with the data based on use of length of the hypotenuse,
from which the air is aspirated into the pool fire. As discussed above,
most of the existing works with regard to air entrainment are based on
numerical analysis and simulation. Further experiments using PIV, LDV
or  other flow field measurement  methods  to quantify  the air entrain-
ment  characteristic  of  pool  fire  plumes  directly  using  various  source
dimensions  and  confinement  conditions  will  be  an  essential  part  of
future work.

3.2. Flame height

The  flame  height  is  one  of  the  most  obvious  and  most  easily
measured morphological parameters of a pool fire, and at the top of the
flame height, the combustion reaction approaches completion. The fire
plumes  of  pool  fires  can  be  divided  into  the  following  three  regions
[165]. The persistent flame zone is the luminous lower part of the flame
region, which appears to maintain a quite steady shape and structure.
The upper part of the plume is an intermittent zone, which behaves as an
undulatory turbulent flame, and the combustion reaction is still intense
within this zone. The top part of the plume is the non-reacting buoyant
plume  region,  and  the  flame  velocity  and  temperature  both  decrease
rapidly  with  increasing  height  in  this  zone.  Vortex-like  rings  are
observed to form near the flame base and are then shed upward peri-
odically, which  leads  to the  unsteady fluctuations and  the  large-scale
turbulence of the diffusion flame. Flame height represents the approxi-
mate  upper  bound  of  heat  release,  where  the  fire  transitions  from  a
combusting plume to a non-reacting buoyant plume. An objective mean
flame height is defined as the axial distance from the fuel surface at 50%

intermittency6  [202].  The  flame  height  is  dependent  upon  several
fundamental quantities, including the burning rate, the shape and size of
the fuel source, the heat of combustion of the fuel, the stoichiometric
ratio of the fuel, and the air entrainment properties [181].

As mentioned above, gaseous burners can be used to investigate the
pool  fire  dynamics  of  realistic  pool  fires.  To  compare  the  burning
behavior for condensed fuel and gaseous pool fires with the same HRR
more clearly. Fig. 23 presents the flame height data of typical condensed
fuel pool fires and gaseous burners for the same diameter of 0.3 m using
data from [102,203,204] . The heat release rate is based on complete
combustion to stable products. It can be observed that the flame height
of condensed fuel pool fires is in good agreement with that of gaseous
burners around the same HRR, which verifies the validity of emulating
condensed fuel pool fires with gaseous burner.

As noted by de Ris [161], almost all previous models with regard to
the flame height were based on the air entrainment concept; however,
there  was  little  understanding  of  the  turbulent  mixing  of  the  air-fuel
mixture  that  followed  the  entrainment  process.  Recently,  from  this
perspective, Lei and Liu [44] used a scaling law based on the turbulent
viscosity (νt) and the diffusivity (dt) to derive a flame height model based
on the turbulent mixing concept by using data from the literature about
the  two-dimensional  mass  fractions  and  velocities  of  a  non-reacting
helium  (He) plume [213]  and a  large-scale turbulent pool fire [168].
As  mentioned  earlier,  in  the  experiments,  the  mean  flame  height  is
defined  as  the  height  of  50%  intermittency  for  an  ordinary  turbulent
pool fire flame. In theory, the flame shape is defined as the surface where
just enough oxygen has diffused into the fuel to create a stoichiometric
mixture. Therefore, the instantaneous flame height is also widely known
as the highest location where stoichiometric mixture exists in the sim-
ulations.  Both  the  molecular  diffusivity  and  the  turbulent  diffusivity
combine to determine the mixture fraction collectively. In fully turbu-
lent pool fires, the turbulent diffusivity caused by the turbulent fluctu-
ation terms in the scalar transport equation is significantly greater than
the molecular diffusivity. Hence the mean turbulent viscosity the critical
parameter  required  for  flame  height  estimation.  The  mean  turbulent
viscosity (ν=
t ) values within the mean flame height (L0) range are scaled

and N is expressed as shown in Eq. (3-16). The predicted coefficient of
this equation, which is related to environmental and fuel parameters,
the turbulent Schmidt number, and the turbulent viscosity coefficient,
agrees well with the empirical values obtained from the experimental
data.

The  fuel  bed  of  pool  fires  may  be  of  an  arbitrary  geometry.  The
source  shape,  e.g.,  for  rectangular  sources  with  various  aspect  ratios,
will also have an important effect on the near-field air entrainment, and
thus on the flame height. For rectangular propane pool-like flames with
various  aspect  ratios  (i=length  (l)  /width  (w)  ranging  from  1  to  10),

Hasemi [214] proposed the following non-dimensional heat release rate

As noted in Section 3.1.1, the value of Cl  is taken to be 0.179 for
axisymmetric fire sources, 0.199 for rectangular fire sources and 0.444
for line fire sources [171]. In 2014, Hu et al. [172] addressed the issue
that  the  data  in  [176]  that  were  used  to  give  the  rough  value  for  Cl
(around 0.199) were vey limited. For the line source case in particular,

they dropped the last term of Eq. (3-21a),1 + 2Cl

of Cl =0.444 [176]. Based on their assessment of extensive experimental
data from small scale rectangular diffusion flames, Hu et al. [172] found
that Cl  showed little change when the aspect ratio varied from 1:1 to

aspect ratios.

Another basic but practical ambient condition that must be consid-
ered is the atmospheric pressure, which varies at different elevations.
The  flame  height  of  a  pool  fire  was  observed  to  change  non-
monotonically  with  increasing  ambient  pressure,  initially  increasing
before following a decreasing regime [124,215] as shown in Fig. 26. It
should be noted that the transport of the oxidizer into the reaction zone
is governed by two mechanisms: molecular diffusion for laminar flames,
and  air  entrainment  mixing  for  turbulent  flames.  At  relatively  low
sub-atmospheric pressures, a low-HRR flame tends to be fairly laminar
because the molecular diffusivity J (i.e., diffusion transport) is dominant
and the buoyancy-driven air entrainment is weak in this case. The flame
height  could  be  explained  by  extending  the  Burke-Schuman  diffusion
flame theory [216], which follows the form L0∝ufD2/(J + ς), where uf is
the fuel velocity and ς is the eddy diffusivity (representing air entrain-

be expressed by using the functions shown in Fig. 24. Therefore, a lower

thus  relies  on  the  relative  importance  of  molecular  diffusion  versus

radiation-controlled ethanol and n-heptane pool fires with the same area
of 900 cm2 and aspect ratios i of 1 ~ 8 in Hefei (100.0 ± 1.0 kPa) and
Lhasa  (65.0  ± 1.5  kPa).  Their  results  showed  that  the  flame  height
decreased with respect to i as follows:

The influence of gravity (i.e., the buoyancy) on the flame height has
also been demonstrated. Most et al. [215] found that the flame height of
a 62 mm ethane gas burner showed a -1/3 power law dependence on the
gravitational acceleration level, which ranged from 0.2g to 12g as shown

ameters of 15, 20, and 30 mm, and gravitational acceleration levels of
0.55, 0.6, 0.65, and 1g). These results are attributed to the fact that the
chemical reaction in the flame may be mitigated because of the reduc-
tion in the buoyancy-assisted air entrainment. By combining these re-
sults, one might postulate that the flame height initially increases and
subsequently decreases with increasing gravity level, with a peak value
appearing around the normal gravity level. However, despite the fact
that the effects of pressure on the flame height resemble those of gravity,
they  have  opposing  effects  upon  the  soot  formation  behavior.  The
increased  air  entrainment  due  to  the  stronger  buoyancy  that  occurs
under hyper-gravity leads to a shorter residence time and better mixing,
which tends to mitigate soot formation. In contrast, the soot formation
reaction rate shows a square law dependence on pressure that contrib-
utes to the formation of a sootier yellow flame with increasing pressure
[139].

Basically, regardless of which of the boundary conditions (i.e., the
degree  of  confinement,  pressure,  or  gravity)  was  varied,  the  air
entrainment conditions and the turbulent mixing process would both be

notably altered, thus influencing the size and the shape of the pool fire.
Specifically,  different  pressure  or  gravity  conditions  would  lead  to
changes in the buoyancy effect, and thus in the entrainment rate because
it is induced by the buoyant upward flow. To provide a more general
method  for  the  pool  fire-induced  flow  field  computation,  it  will  be
necessary  to  originate  an  approach  from  the  basic  equations.  Specifi-
cation of the thermal expansion and vorticity source terms is necessary
to  enhance  the  understanding  of  pool  fire  entrainment  under  various
boundary conditions based on the distributions of the gas species con-
centrations and the mean velocity field.

3.3. Temperature and velocity profiles

Free-burning  pool  fires  are  dominated  by  buoyancy  and  were
generally  thought  to  be  in  the  turbulent  regime  of  combustion.  The
flame  temperature  and  velocity  are  also  of  fundamental  interest  in
delineation  of  the  flame  properties  [162,165,168,176,182,218-230].
The  flame  velocity  characteristics  are  induced  by  the  non-reacting
thermal  plume  and  by  the  reactive  flow  buoyancy  caused  by  local
temperature  variations  [166],  while  the  flame  temperature  is  the
product  of  the  combustion  reaction  behavior,  and  these  properties
contribute together to the turbulent transportation behavior. There  is
little  sense  in  measuring  the  instantaneous  temporal  and  spatial tem-
perature  and  velocity  profiles  of  the  flame  because  of  the  lack  of  a
preferred  direction  [165].  The  time-averaged  temperatures  and

velocities  were  thus  selected  to  be  measured  at  a  fixed  position  (the
Euler method in fluid mechanics) to characterize the thermal and flow
structures of diffusion flames in nearly all the relevant studies. The most
classical theory for the purely buoyant diffusion flame temperature and
velocity along the center line was proposed in detail by McCaffery in
1979 [165], which divided the flame into three reasonable regimes as
follows: the continuous flame region (ΔT ∼ const, u0~Z1/2), the inter-
(cid:0) 5/3,
mittent region (ΔT ∼ Z
u0~Z

(cid:0) 1, u0~const) and the plume region (ΔT ∼ Z

(cid:0) 1/3) as illustrated in Fig. 27.

With  regard  to  the  regime  in  the  plume  region,  which  originated
from convectional plume theories [231,232], similar relationships were
obtained  successively  by  Heskestad  and  Kung  et  al.  [219,220].  The
virtual origin Z0 of the plume relative to the fire source was considered
(ΔT ∼ (Z (cid:0) Z0)(cid:0) 5/3,u0 ∼ (Z (cid:0) Z0)(cid:0) 1/3)  in  both  of  their  models.  Similar
results were presented and verified for infinite line source pool fires by
Quintiere  [176],  Hasemi  [233],  and  Cox  [177],  however,  they  used
different power dependences ((cid:0) 1 and 0) on Z for the temperature rise
and velocity when compared with those used for axisymmetric source
((cid:0) 5/3 and (cid:0) 1/3). Based on the information about the pool fire char-
acteristic length scale and using the empirical relation, Audouin [229]
obtained the mean flame temperatures via an image processing method.
In  fact,  the  temperature  that  originated  from  the  fuel  surface  closely
approached the boiling point of the fuel [226]; the flame temperature
then  increased  up  to  the  constant-temperature  flame  regime,  which
could  be  predicted  based  on  the  mixture  fraction  being  a  conserved
scalar  [46].  Additionally,  the  time-averaged  value  distribution  in  the
radial direction was found to follow a Gaussian distribution or ’top-hat’
profile  reasonably  well  in  the  plume,  although  there  was  not  such  a
strong resemblance in the continuous- and intermittent flame regimes

[165]. Near the fuel surface, the formation of a cool vapor cone above
the surface causes relatively higher temperatures to occur at the pool
periphery  [70,224].  Additionally,  Joulain  et  al.  [70]  found  that  the
maximum  temperature  in  the  measured  pool  fire  isotherm  coincides
almost  exactly  with  the  luminous  flame  envelope,  particularly  at  the
flame base.

More importantly, Heskestad [219,222] developed a useful param-
eter (ξ) by combining the plume law function of velocity and tempera-
ture  and  bridging  the  relationship  required  to  determine  the  plume
velocity from the excess temperature data, where

Equation (3-23) was demonstrated to be applicable within the range
down to at least the mean flame height, or possibly somewhat lower,
where ξ = 2.2. Naturally, the maximum velocity could also be approx-
imated,  which  occurs  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  mean  flame  height
where the temperature rise may be taken as 650 K. Additionally, while
pool fires have dramatically varying heat release rates, the maximum
temperature rise ΔT is close to 900 K in the deep-flame regime for most
fuels and fire sizes (1.219 – 2.438 m), with the exception of the silicone
fluid  fire  [220],  which  was  claimed  to  differ  because  of  its  very  low
flame  height  to  diameter  ratio.  When  the  fire  diameter  is  increased
further (to the 2.4 – 30 m range) [162], the flame temperature also rises
in the manner given by Eq. (3-24) [104]:

where CT,f is taken to be 0.5 in the flame continuous combustion region.
Koseki [104] attributed this to behavior to a declining radiative fraction
χr. As mentioned earlier, when black smoke obscures the flame, it causes
a radiation blockage, and the transmittance of the external eddies falls
off. It can be found that an inverse relation exists between Tf and χr. As
mentioned  above,  the  measured  variables  of  the  hot  plume  should
fluctuate over time; therefore, the turbulence intensities on the center-

line were calculated, and were found to be approximately T
′
/u0= 0.27 [234], where ’ represents the root mean square value of

the  turbulent  fluctuation.  More  rigorous  descriptions  of  the  scalar
properties (including the species concentration included), e.g., proba-
bility density functions (PDFs), should also be examined in addition to
the time-averaged values.

For a pool fire located close to a wall or in a corner as described in
Section  3.1.2,  Hasemi  and  Takahashi  et  al.  [190,191]  noted  that  the
temperature  attenuates  less  rapidly  with  increasing  height  in  the
buoyant plume region (i.e., at higher plume temperatures), because less
air is entrained into the plume when compared with to the unbounded
fire burning case. Nevertheless, the flame velocity and species concen-
tration  data  along  the  axial  and  radial  directions  have  barely  been
considered  in  past  research.  It  is  necessary  to  measure  the  relevant
essential parameters to gain improved knowledge of the development of
the  pool  fire  plume,  especially  when  the  scale  of  suppression  of  the
growth of eddies scale is considered.

The previously descriptions that summarizes the pool fire tempera-
ture  and  velocity  characteristics  were  determined  under  quiescent
conditions,  but  these  characteristics  would  change  remarkably  under
the action of wind. The temperature distributions in both the near-field
visible flame region and the far-field downwind region of the pool fire
have  been  investigated  in  recent  decades.  Hirano  [235,236]  first
investigated,  the  laminar  boundary-layer  diffusion  flame  temperature
and velocity profiles at different horizontal locations along a flat plate
over  gaseous  and  liquid  fuel  surfaces  in  wind.  A  gas  stream  velocity
overshoot was observed on the lee side of the leading flame edge near
the blue-flame zone that may have arisen from pressure distortion. The
gas-phase temperature in the blue-flame zone also increased and then
shifted  to  decrease  slightly  with  increasing  distance  from  the  leading
edge, as depicted in Fig. 28. Recently, Singh et al. [237] found that the
dimensionless temperature gradients at the fuel surface were fifth-order
polynomial  fits  to  the  dimensionless  distance  for  methanol  boundary
layer diffusion flames. The relevant fine measurements were all taken in
the  laminar  flame  regime,  and  additional  techniques  should  also  be
developed  in  future  work  to  enable  practical  study  of  turbulent
boundary-layer combustion.

In the 2000s, several researchers studied the inclined plume char-
acteristics of pool fire sources with different shapes in windy conditions
[238–240] on the basis of the studies by Yokoi and Saga [241,242]. The
temperature values along the inclined plume line that were generated by
circular and rectangular gaseous pool fires were found to be lower than
that of a vertical plume in still air, and these temperatures decreased
rapidly as the wind speed increased [238,239]. The fire plume velocities
along the trajectories downwind of fire sources with various shapes (e.
g., square, rectangular) were measured and correlated empirically [240,
243] by Oka et  al. in 2008, who reported that the velocity along the
inclined  axis  under  windy  conditions  was  lower  than  that  under
wind-free  conditions.  As  the  resultant  force  of  the  crosswind  inertial
force and the upward buoyancy induced by the temperature elevation

In 2015, the 2-D thermal field of a 2 m Jet-A fuel wind-blown pool
fire, including the flame temperature were investigated experimentally
by  Lam  et  al.  [154]  at  wind  speeds  of  up  to  10  m/s.  Based  on  their
updated  research,  the  effects  of  cross-winds  on  the  temperature  rise
characteristics  in  the  relatively  far  downwind  regions  of  square/r-
ectangular pool fire plume was obtained by Himoto [244,245]. Fig. 29 a)
illustrates the temperature rise (ΔT) that occurs downwind of a square
pool fire under windy conditions, which shows that the location of the
maximum temperature rise changes under wind effects. To account for
the effect of the aspect-ratio i, a similarity model to depict the transition
of the temperature rise along the trajectory was derived successfully by
introducing an adjustment of the dimensionless distance along the tra-
jectory dC* (see Fig. 29 b)). Additionally, ground-level excess temper-
atures were predicted more accurately after the introduction of a virtual
point source in the windy conditions, similar to the still air case [245],
but systematic elucidations were still required.

3.4. Pulsation and instability

The generation and dissipation of vorticity by flamelets governs the
combustion of the buoyant turbulent diffusion flames that are charac-
teristic of pool fires. In contrast to momentum driven turbulent diffusion
flames,  which  generally  have  exterior  sources  of  vorticity,  pool  fires
naturally undergo a bifurcation to a globally unstable puffing state that
is driven by baroclinic and buoyant vorticity production [160,161]. This
state exhibits self-sustained oscillatory behavior, shedding large toroidal
coherent structures at a well-established frequency, and this phenome-
non  is  described  to  in  the  literature  as  “puffing”.  This  behavior  in-
fluences the air entrainment rate, soot production, and the radiant heat
output. Pool fire puffing has been studied extensively in the literature,
via experiments, numerical simulations, and scale modeling [19,24,160,
202,246-254].

The  buoyant  flow  that  rises  from  the  pool  fire  surface  causes  the
formation and periodic shedding of toroidal vortices, and these vortical
structures, which were investigated in detail by Tieszen et al in 1996
[160], and were then revisited by de Ris in 2013 [161], are primarily
attributed to the three stages depicted in Fig. 30. The first is baroclinic
vorticity  generation  (∇ρ  × ∇P/ρ2  [161]),  which  produces  rotational
motion  on  a  small  scale.  Baroclinic  vorticity  generation  is  caused  by
misalignment  of  the  density  and  pressure  gradients,  which  is  closely
associated with gravity. The second stage is amalgamation, which pro-
duces larger-scale rotational structures from the smaller initial ones, and
the third stage is turbulent cascade from larger to smaller structures. The
largest vortical structures dominate air entrainment into the fire plume,
and stirring and mixing then occur over the complete range of scales
down to the molecular level. Furthermore, the buoyant generation of
vorticity  and  its  subsequent  dissipation  within  the  flamelets  are
considered  to  drive  the  combustion  of  the  fuel  and  the  oxidant  in
buoyant turbulent diffusion flames, and drive the characteristics of fire
plumes. The generation of vorticity peaks occurs near the micro-scale,
where  the  vorticity  generation  process  comes  into  balance  with  its
dissipation. This is an example of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability7  mech-
anism  where  disturbances  generally  originate  on  a  small  scale,  grow,
and  then  eventually  encompass  the  entire  flow.  This  mechanism  is
characterized by a nearly constant Rayleigh number that is independent
of the fuel type, which explains why experiments have shown that both
the radiant fractions and the volumetric heat release rates of buoyant
turbulent diffusion flames are almost nearly independent of the overall

fluids of different densities which occurs when the lighter fluid is pushing the
heavier fluid.

diameters  >10  cm  [252].  The  first  mode  results  in  the  sinuous
meandering of the diffusion flame, which is a characteristic of diffusion
flames  that  originated  from  small  diameter  nozzles.  This  instability
originates in the contracting region of a steady-state buoyant diffusion
flame envelope and then develops into a sinuous motion of the flame.
The second mode is the varicose mode which develops very close to the
nozzle exit in the form of axisymmetric perturbations of a contracting
flame  surface.  In  this  mode,  the  flame  oscillations  result  in  toroidal
vortical structures that burn out at the flame top, and these structures
cause the flame height fluctuations. The oscillation frequencies of these
two modes are different, with the sinuous mode having a higher oscil-
lation  frequency  than  the  varicose  mode.  Additionally,  the  frequency
scaling behavior of the sinuous mode shows a weak dependence on the
(cid:0) 0.1 [252] as this instability develops significantly
burner diameter of D
further downstream of the source. It was also observed that the insta-
bility  modes  switched  from  one  to  the  other  and  the  probability  of
observation of the varicose mode increases with increasing Richardson
number g’D/V2, where V is the characteristic uprising velocity. The most
recent research has shown that the instability transition from the sym-
metric varicose mode to the asymmetric sinuous modes occurred with
either  decreasing  burner  diameter  or  increasing  fuel  supply  rate.  The
parameters  Fr and  Re were found  to govern the  instability transition,
where Fr dominated the buoyancy-driven flames and Re dominated the
momentum-driven flames [258].

As Fig. 31 shows, the puffing movements mainly occur in two modes:
the laminar flames are subject to both varicose and sinuous instabilities
at small scales, while the varicose mode becomes dominant at source

It is well established that, under normal ambient conditions, diffu-
sion flames that form over hydrocarbon fuel pools greater than a few
centimeters in diameter begin puffing with a frequency of the order of 10
Hz, and that this frequency f is proportional to the inverse square root of

which is a scaling law that follows from the balance between the un-
steady, convective, and buoyancy terms in the Navier–Stokes equations,
and where g denotes the gravitational acceleration.

The average frequency for the puffing behavior was determined by
counting the puffs on the animation and then dividing the count by the
total animation time. The experimentally measured results of Cetegen
and Ahmed [259] are shown in Fig. 32 (a), which quantifies Eq. (3-26) in
the form of f ≈1.5D

(cid:0) 1/2 for pool fires.

Equation  (3-26)  is  similar  to  the  scaling  relationship  between  the
Strouhal number and the Froude number, as represented by Eq. (3-27)
below [19,24,250]:

St∝Fr1/2.

(3-27)

For pool fires, strong amplification of the puffing is expected because
the  local  heat  release  maintains  the  buoyancy,  and  thus  the  puffing

intensity is higher than that of the thermal plumes because of differences
in buoyancy, as illustrated in Fig. 32(b) [24].

Table  5  shows  a  summary  of  the  equations  for  the  pulsation  fre-
quency of free buoyant turbulent flames [260], where g*, u0, ρp, ρ∞, Ca,
Tf, l and w are the local gravitational acceleration g’ when normalized
with respect to g (g*=g’/g), the plume characteristic uprising velocity,
the plume gas density, the proportionality factor, the ambient air tem-
perature, the flame temperature, and the longer and shorter side lengths
of the rectangular source, respectively.

In recent years, the onset and evolution of the puffing movements of
pool fires have attracted considerable attention. The critical conditions
for the onset of puffing were addressed by using the viscous effects as a
potential stabilization mechanism [45]. For the relevant canonical case
of round liquid pools without swirls, apart from the inherent thermo-
chemical and transport parameters that are associated with the fuel, the
pool fire puffing was found to be governed by the Rayleigh number, a
single  dimensionless  number  that  scales  with  the  cube  of  the  pool
diameter D. The Rayleigh number is expressed as follows:

Ra = gD3

/

vαt,

(3-34)

where  v  is  the  kinematic  viscosity  and  αt  is  the  thermal  diffusion
coefficient.

Consequently, for a fixed fuel under fixed ambient conditions, there
is a critical fuel pool diameter that is associated with a critical value of
the Rayleigh number, above which the flame begins puffing. A global
linear stability analysis that accounts for the axi-symmetry of the pre-
vailing instability mode was developed to describe the bifurcation that
uses the limit of an infinitely fast reaction while taking the non-unity
Lewis  number  (Le>1)  and  the  vaporization  characteristics  of  typical
liquid fuels into account. Predictions of the critical puffing conditions,
including  the  critical  diameters  and  puffing  frequencies,  have  been
provided  for  methanol  and  heptane  pool  fires  [45],  and  these  fuels
selected as the typical alcohol and alkane fuels, respectively. The critical
Rayleigh number depends on the fuel’s thermochemical and transport
properties and on aspects of the physical configuration used, including
the type of material used for the horizontal surface that surrounds the

greater than 10,000 if the transport properties are evaluated at ambient

corresponds to a critical pool diameter of approximately 20 mm in the
laboratory, with an onset puffing frequency of the order of 10 Hz [45].
Additionally, for small pools with lower Rayleigh numbers, the puffing
frequency is more strongly dependent on the viscous effect because f ∼

The evolution of the flame necking-in dynamic characteristics and
the  way  in  which  they  relate  to  the  flame  instability  behaviors  was
assessed  via  experimental  measurements  in  [46],  using  ethanol  pool
fires with diameters of 0.04–0.25 m and different lip heights (0.3–2.0
cm). Based on direct time sequence analysis of the flame photographs,
the  necking-in  characteristic  maximum  depth  (Ɗmax),  the  average
necking-in  velocity (Unecking-in), the maximum uprising height (H max),
the average uprising velocity (Uuprising), the vortices shedding instability
frequency,  and  the  characteristic  vortices  formation  lift  time  were
quantified  to  determine  the  evolutions  of  these  parameters  with  pool
size and lip height and their associated dominant instability motions.
Three different flame instability motions were identified: the short life
Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability, the extended R-T instability, and the
puffing instability. The dominant instability motion was found to transit
from the extended R-T instability to puffing instability with increasing
pool  size  or  lip  height.  The  pumping  capacity  for  large-scale  vortices

formation (which could be quantified using Ɗmax, H max, Unecking-in, amd
Uuprising) is primarily associated with the extended R-T instability fre-
quency. As Fig. 33 shows, the extended R-T instability frequency (f) is
higher than the puffing frequency, while the f value of the short life R-T
instability is higher than that of extended R-T instability. The frequency
(f) for puffing increases slightly with increasing lip height and decreases
with increasing pool size, and can also be expressed in non-dimensional
terms using the St number as a function of the Fr number in forms similar
to those of Eq. (3-30). The life-times for the extended R-T instabilities
increase with increasing diameter and are smaller than the lifetimes for
puffing. Additionally, the puffing lifetimes decrease with increasing lip
height and increase with pool diameter (τt∝D1/2).

Additionally, a mathematical model was proposed to bridge the gap
between the toroidal vortex dynamics and the oscillation scaling law.
Because the detachment of a continuously growing vortex ring can be
dictated by a universal constant, which is essentially a non-dimensional
circulation of the vortex, Zhang et al. [47] established a theoretical the
connection  between  the  periodicity  of  the  toroidal  vortices  and  the
flickering  of  a  buoyant  diffusion  flame.  The  relationship  between  the
Strouhal number and the Froude number was then recast into Eq. (3-35),
which  is  dependent  on  the  physical  constants  C1  and  C2,  where  the
former accounts for the toroidal vortex detachment and the latter relates
to the boundary and configuration condition of the fuel inlet,

Equation (3-35) provides a unified approach to the treatment of pool
fire flames when Fr → 0, regardless of differences among the fuel types
and the pool sizes. C1  denotes a threshold for accumulation of the cir-
culation  inside the  toroidal  vortex,  for which  a  value  of  4  is  adopted
[264]. C2  can be taken to be either 0.5 or 1.5, according to Ref. [47].
Note here that this formula is not applicable to cases where Fr>1. Fig. 34
presents the theoretical prediction results of St versus 1/Fr for gaseous
pool fires with known initial fuel velocities. These results show that the
predicted values with C2=0.5 or 1.5 are nearly identical when Fr≤1.

Flame bending behavior is the most commonly occurring phenom-
enon for any outdoor fire that is subjected to wind. As mentioned pre-
viously,  flame  bending  will  affect  the  amount  of  heat  transferred  by
convection, conduction and radiation to the fuel surface, and will thus

affect  the  burning  rate.  Furthermore,  changes  in  the  radiation  or  in
direct flame impingement on items located downwind may potentially
accelerate the fire spreading process and result in a more serious thermal
hazard. Considerable attention has been paid to the flame tilt angle since
the 1960s. and several correlations have been proposed to predict the tilt
angle. A summary of the proposed flame tilt correlations is presented in
Table 6. Almost all of these correlations have consistently found a strong
relationship between the flame tilt angle and the Froude number (or the
dimensionless  wind  speed  u*)  calculated  based  on  the  wind  speed,
which indicates, in a physical nature, that the competition between the
crosswind and the buoyant flow controls the flame tilt behavior.

attempted to correlate the data from two-dimensional wooden crib fires
(in which the width of the crib was greater than both the length and the
height)  in  wind  at  speeds  ranging  roughly  from  1.52–4.57  m/s  by

proportional  to  the  momentum  per  unit  mass  of  the  flame’s  upward

oped a piece-wise function on the basis of Eq. (3-36). In Eq. (3-37), u*

used widely to correlate the data from liquefied natural gas (LNG) pool
fires by Moorhouse [269], from diesel and gasoline thin-layer boilover
fires by Ferrero et al. [270], and from acetone fires by Tang et al. [100].
However, the coefficients used in their formulae are different in each
case. It should be note that the experimental details related to the flame
tilt angle correlations (e.g., the flame tilt angle measurement method,
the fuel quantity, and the location of the ground level) may account for
the differences in coefficients.

The  second  prototype  was  initially  developed  by  Welker  et  al.
[271–273] using wind-blown liquid pool fires in the form of Eq. (3-42),
which followed on from the earlier works by Hamada [274] and Pipkin
[275]. In this case, it was assumed that the air entrainment was uniform
around  the  flame,  and  that  the  net  momentum  influx  caused  by  air
entrainment  was  negligible.  The  power  dependence  on  Re  was  very
small (0.07), indicating that the flame tilt angle is strongly dependent on
the Froude number. The formula developed by Pipkin [275] needed to

approximate the flame gas density value. The difference between Eqs.
(3-41) and (3-42) of the factor of cosθ in the denominator is related to
the assumption that the flame volume is constant. Following Eq. (3-42),
Fang [276] also developed a model to predict the turbulent flame tilt
angle in the form of Eq. (3-43), where Cfw is a dimensionless coefficient
that is nearly independent of the wind speed.

In addition, Anderson et al. [277] noted that the tangent value could
be characterized based on the energy ratio of the cross wind stream qu
and the energy rates per unit area for flame ER, where q is the dynamic
pressure  due  to  the  crosswind.  Oka  et  al.  [278]  proposed  a  tilt  angle
correlation on the basis of the mass flux balance between the wind and
the  upward  hot  current.  The  wind-blown  flame  height  was  approxi-
mated as a function of the wind speed and the heat release rate, and two
empirical formulae were correlated to quantify two flame tilt angles: one
for the flame tip bending angle from the source center, denoted by θ1,
and the other for the angle from the flame base center to the flame tip,
denoted by θ2.

However, the responses of the liquid fuel burning rates to wind may
differ to those of solid fuels (which involve pyrolysis prior to combustion
with  the  oxidizer)  or  gaseous  fuels  (for  which  the  rate  of  fuel  con-
sumption  could  remain  fixed  in  varied  wind  speeds).  Therefore,  the
characteristic upward hot current velocity may be differ for the different
fuels. More recently, Hu et al. [279] proposed a new formula to estimate
intermediate-scale pool fire (5–25 cm) flame tilt angles in wind at speeds
of  0-2.5 m/s  in  2013. The fuel  burning  rate,  which  changes with  the
wind speed, was incorporated into a non-dimensional global parameter,

from the vertical axis. This parameter, which equates the wind speed to a
characteristic uprising flame buoyant velocity, was shown to correlate
the liquid pool fire flame tilt angles data well. It was also found later that
this equation was applicable to larger pool sizes ranging up to 70 cm
[99]. However, it was also shown to overestimate the values of a 2 m
Jet-A  fuel  pool  fire  in  [153],  in  which  the  measured  values  were
compared comprehensively compared with values from the prediction
models in the literature.

3.5.2. Flame length

Under the action of a crosswind, the flame length is governed by the
coupling effect between its own vertical buoyancy flux and the external
crosswind momentum flux. Apparently, the crosswind deflects the flame
downwind.  Air  is  then  entrained  by  the  flame  because  of  its  own
buoyancy in wind-free condition. However, the situation will be much

at  the  windward  shearing  air-flame  interface,  while  that  level  of
entrainment  is  apparently  surpassed  on  the  leeside  because  of  the
buoyancy stability [101]. Therefore, the change in the air entrainment is
able to influence the flame length considerably. Table 7 summarizes the

Note that the Froude number Fr and the dimensionless wind speed u*

Eqs.  (3-47a)  and  (3-47b),  respectively.  Essentially,  Fr  and  u*  have

Experimentally,  similar  to  the  burning  rates  for  wind-blown  pool
fires,  no  general  trend  for  flame  length  evolution  has  been  observed
versus  wind  speed.  This  was  indicated  by  the  different  values  of  the
exponent for the dimensionless wind speed u*. For Eqs. (3-48, 3-49, and
3-51), the flame length decreases with increasing wind speed because of
the enhanced fuel-air mixing (the exponent sign was positive), while the
length increases with increasing wind speed (negative sign for γ3) for Eq.
(3-50). Welker et al.’s report [272] observed that the flame lengths of
alkane and alcohol pool fires were also independent of the wind speed.
Another predictive model form (Eq. (3-52)) was obtained by using the
known horizontal flame extent and flame height [278] and was repre-
sented as the sum of two parts, with the dominant variables being either

the wind speed or the heat release rate.

In  addition  to  the  determination  of  total  inclined  flame  length,
several  researchers  have  also  tried  to  decouple  this  two-dimensional
problem  into  two  parameters,  i.e.,  the  flame’s  vertical  height  and  its
horizontal extent. In 1965, Putnam [283] compared the flame vertical
height and the horizontal flame extent of point-source and area-source
free-burning  fires,  which  were  normalized  with  respect  to  the  flame
height  in  the  absence  of  wind,  versus  the  wind  velocity.  The  results
showed that the dimensionless flame height decreased with the negative
1/4-power of u2/gL0, while the extent of the dimensionless horizontal
flame  increased  with  the  1/6-power  of  u2/gL0  when  u  was  relatively
large.  Joulain  et  al.  [284]  observed  that  the  horizontal  flame  extent
increased linearly with increasing wind speed (0.5–2.5 m/s) for a 0.2 m
propane pool fire. In [278], Oka et al. also investigated the flame height

and  then  declines  when  u  is  increased  further  because  of  the  smaller

[287] studied the flame heights of acetone pool fires with various aspect

± 1.0 kPa and 65.0 ± 1.5 kPa, respectively) in wind at speeds of up to 3
m/s. Both short-side facing the wind and long-side facing the wind ar-
rangements were used, and it was found that the flame heights at both
ambient pressures could be correlated using the equation proposed by
Oka et al. [286]. It was also noted that a modified characteristic burner
radius r**=(l+w)/π was introduced that included the burner length and
width, which might provide a better reflection of the air entrainment
effect along the rim of the rectangular burner. In addition, comparison
studies of the morphologies of pool fires against a wall or in semi-infinite
space  [288,289]  were  conducted.  In  the  presence  of  a  wall,  the
time-averaged total flame length for a 5 cm propane pool fire was found
to change nonmonotonically with increasing wind velocities of up to 1.6
m/s [288], with similar results being obtained for the horizontal flame
extent of 10–20 cm propane pool fires in wind at speeds of up to 3.5 m/s

used satisfactorily with regard to the pool fire flame height, both against
a  wall  and  in  semi-infinite  space.  Note  that  D3/4u3/2/g3/4L3/2

3.5.3. Flame sag and base drag

One flame shape distortion that is peculiar to tank fires above the
ground  is  flame  sag,  where  the  flame  spills  over  the  rim  and  sinks
downward on the trailing side below the pool lip before reaching the
ground under windy conditions. This behavior would pose severe haz-
ards to the pool’s bounding materials, particularly on the trailing side. In
the 1990s, this phenomenon was observed and reported by Lautkaski
[290]  and  Rew  et  al.  [291] for  the  first  time.  They  reported that the
flame  sag  represented  approximately  one  third  of  the  flame  base
extension  for  a  52-m-diameter  isohexane  tank  fire  based  on  in  situ
observation results. However, the inherent fundamental aspects of this
sag  phenomenon  were  not  clearly  addressed  in  their  studies.  More
recently, in 2019, Hu et al. [41] analyzed the inherent interacting forces
that drive this phenomenon using three nondimensional groups, i.e., the

inverse Froude number near the pool base (ρ∞(cid:0) ρf)gD/ρ∞u2, the inverse
Froude  number  the  between  total  flame  buoyancy  (caused  by  a  non-
combusting purely thermal plume and local buoyancy attributable to the
steep local temperature conditions [166]) and  the wind inertial force
(  ̇
Q /D)g/ρ∞CpT∞u3, and the density ratio of the ambient to the sub-layer
fuel ρf/ρ∞  (see Fig. 35). When using these three dimensionless param-
eters, the predicted flame sag length and the critical wind speed required
for flame sag to reach the ground level agreed well with the measured
values.

For pool fires that are elevated above the ground to a specific height,
after  the  sunken  flame  reaches  the  ground  level,  the  flame  then  con-
tinues to extend downwind along the floor. Alternatively, for a pool fire
on  the  ground  (i.e.,  where  the  pool  edge  is  flush  with  the  floor),  the
flame base is then stretched from the leeside edge of the pool in the wind
direction.  This  specialized  phenomenon  under  windy  conditions  is
called the flame base drag, the trailing extent, or the flame base extent.
The flame base drag is observed as an extension of the flame base that
enlarges the fire area and poses a potential fire risk and thermal hazards,
particularly for items located downstream (see Fig. 15(b)). Therefore,
the flame base drag length is a critical parameter that must be modeled
and  quantified.  In  1964,  Byram  et  al.  [292]  first  noticed  the  trailing
effect in ethanol fires during their wind tunnel testing. The underlying
mechanism for the flame base drag seems to be that the bulk of the fuel
vapor at the boiling point, which is heavier than the ambient air, tends to
descend until it has been heated sufficiently cause the flame to rise after
being dragged to a certain extent. Multiple paths including a theoretical
derivation [293], a scaling analysis [294] and semi-empirical fitting led
to  three  evident  forms  of  correlation,  where  the  flame  base  drag
appeared to be controlled by (1) Fr, (2) Fr, ρf/ρ∞, and (3) Fr, ρf/ρ∞, and

In 1966, Welker et al. [271] noticed flame base drag when using five
liquid  fuel  types,  and  they  correlated  the  flame  base  drag  data  as  a
function of the density ratio of the fuel vapor to the ambient (ρf/ρ∞) and
the Froude number. Equation (3-54) showed reasonable agreement with
their liquid pool fire data, along with the data of Byram [292]. Moor-
house et al. [269] adapted Eq. (3-54) to fit LNG data specifically, and
obtained the various coefficients shown in Eq. (3-55). The fuel vapor to
air  density  ratio  was  incorporated  explicitly  into  the  constant  in  Eq.
(3-51).  Mudan  [32]  obtained  Eq.  (3-56)  by  combining  the  data  from

vapor to remain near the floor, driven by the negative buoyancy, until it
was heated sufficiently to rise up during the course of combustion at low
wind velocities. At higher wind velocities, the flame was pushed closer
to the ground because the stronger wind momentum flow overwhelmed
the thermal plume’s buoyant flow.

Figs. 36–38 present comparisons of the predicted values when using
the different correlations listed in Table 8 and experimental data that
cover  wide  ranges  of  fuels  and  pan  sizes.  However,  as  illustrated  in
Figs. 36, 37, these correlations are only suitable for the conditions of the
corresponding investigation in each case. As shown in Fig. 36, the flame
base drag values determined by using Eqs. (3-55) and (3-57) are only
applicable to LNG pool fires. These differences between the correlations
could  possibly  be  attributed  to  the  different  fuel-vapor  densities
involved, which indicates that the RHS of Eqs. (3-55) and (3-57) should
be modified to accommodate the change in ρf/ρ∞.

In Fig. 37(a), with the exception of the data for the LNG fires, the
experimental data for the flame base drag were shown to increase at a
higher rate than the predicted values, which indicates that the power
exponent of Fr (i.e., the wind speed) should be higher. Alternatively, a
more likely explanation is that these two equations did not account fully
for the physics behind the flame base drag phenomenon. It was found
that the measured flame base drag values showed better agreement with
the values that were predicted using Eqs. (3-54) and (3-60) (see Fig. 37
(b)),  which  both  have  greater  power  law  dependences  on  the  wind
speed.  The  difference  between  Eq.  (3-54)  and  Eq.  (3-60)  is  the  scale
coefficient that is used. It was noted that Eq. (3-54), when multiplied by
a factor of 2.1, is more applicable to small-to-medium scale pool fires
that range in size from 0.1 to 0.7 m (relative error of within 15.9%),
while Eq. (3-60) with its scale factor of 1.2 is more suitable for appli-
cation to large-scale pool fire with diameters greater than 2 m (relative
error of within 16.5%) because its ordinate value is lower. However, the
equations above have not been generalized to predict the pool fire base
drag for wide ranges of fuels and pan sizes.

Fig. 38 illustrates that the nondimensional flame base drag could be
correlated  in  terms  of  the  wind  Froude  number,  the  wind  Reynolds
number, and the fuel properties-dependent constant Γ. Values of Γ were
listed for some fuels in Table 2 in [293]. The Re signifies that the air
entrainment into the lower part of the flame near the ground is governed
by the turbulent mixing process caused by the wind. Equation (3-59)
provides a better representation of the flame base drag than the previous

Welker  et  al.  and  Moorhouse  et  al.  [269,271].  Equation  (3-57)  is  a
modification of Eq. (3-56) where a constant coefficient is added to ac-
count for the fuel density of the LNG. However, Lautkaski [290] did not
find any evidence for an increase in the flame base drag with increasing
values of ρf/ρ∞ in the range from 1.6 to 2.7 for large-scale pool fires. He
argued that the flame’s trailing extent terminated at the stagnation line
between  the  wind  flow  and  the  airflow  that  was  induced  by  air
entrainment  in  the  opposite  direction,  and  proposed  that  the  density
ratio term could be omitted. Raj [293] developed a physical model to
estimate  the  flame  base  extent  by  introducing  a  new  dimensionless
group Γ that included the volumetric expansion ratio of the gases due to
combustion ω and the density ratio.

Nevertheless,  discrepancies  were  found  between  the  values  esti-
mated  via  the  relevant  semi-empirical  correlations  and  the  measured
data from 2-m-diameter Jet-A fuel pool fire in winds at speeds of 3–10
m/s, as determined by Weckman et al. in 2015 [153]. They postulated
that the flame base drag was related to the tendency of the denser fuel

In recent years, advances have been made in developing an under-
standing of the pool fire flame base drag behavior. In strong crosswinds
(with Fr up to 45.9), the flame base extent of propane square pool fires
was observed to change non-monotonically with increasing wind speeds
for the first time by Hu et al. [285], where the initial increase was fol-
lowed  by  a  decreasing  regime. A piecewise  function  (Eq.  (3-61)) was
then  developed  to  quantify  both  the  increasing  regime  and  the
, and ρf/ρ∞. The same phenomenon
decreasing regime included Fr,
was observed for rectangular propane gaseous pool fires with various
aspect ratios (i ranging from 1 to 8) in windy conditions, where Tang
et  al.  [243]  noted  that  the  increase-to-decrease  critical  wind  speed
decreased  with  increasing  aspect  ratio.  Pockets  of  broad  blue  flames
were observed at the leading edge of the pool because the residence time
was not long enough for soot formation from the comparatively highly
strained  flame.  Additionally,  in  2017,  Hu  et  al.  [294]  performed  ex-
periments using acetone and heptane as fuels in Lhasa (65.0 ± 1.5 kPa)
and Hefei (100.0 ± 1.0 kPa) to determine the effects of sub-atmospheric
pressure on the flame base drag behavior, where the flame base drag
length was found to be significantly longer at sub-atmospheric pressures
at normal atmospheric pressure. A theoretical approach was developed
to account for the relationship between the inertial wind force and the
flame  buoyancy,  along  with  the  interplay  between  the  wind  and  the
buoyant flow rate (~heat release rate), by using a scaling law. Equation

equations by covering a wide range of pool scales (from laboratory scale
to field scale), fuels, and burning rates, as shown in Fig. 38. This model is
only applicable to fuels that have heavier-than-air densities, because it is
assumed that flame base drag occurs when the averaged density of the
heavier fuel vapor is equal to the density of the ambient air as a result of
combustion. Therefore, it may be justifiable to exclude data from fuels

The correlations that were derived for gaseous fuels (Eqs. (3-61) and
(3-62)) were dependent on the dimensionless heat release rate, but the
burning rate and combustion efficiency data for the corresponding base
drag lengths are not currently available in the literature. Therefore, the
differences observed in the base drag length predictions when correla-
tions are used interchangeably for liquid fuels or diffusive burners will
be subjected to verification in future work with more laboratory-scale or
field-scale tests.

Furthermore,  the  flame  base  drag  characteristics  of  elevated  pool
fires with various side wall heights above the floor were investigated by
Hu  et  al.  [296].  As  a  result  of  the  flame  sag  behavior  [41]  before  it
reached the ground floor, the flame base drag was found to be shorter
when  the  side  walls  were  higher.  In  2019,  as  depicted  in  Fig.  39,  a
generalized physics model given by  S  ̇m/ρ∞
u×(u2/g)2,consisting of a characterized
length scale u2/g, the volumetric air entrainment u × (u2/g)2, and the air
required  for  stoichiometric  combustion  S  ̇m/ρ∞,  was  developed  to
correlate well with the five basic morphological parameters (i.e., total
horizontal flame length, flame height, flame base drag, and two defi-
nitions of the tilt angle) when Fr>0.13. More importantly, two distinct
regions were also indicated in Fig. 39. In region 1, the flame is close to
the ground, where the crosswind momentum is dominant, and this could
be analogous to a  boundary layer  flow. Region 1 is  then followed by
region  2,  in  which  the  flame  is  lifted  from  the  ground  because  the
buoyancy effect overcomes the inertial force.

Heat transfer in the flame base drag regime was also clarified and
found to be a crucial parameter in controlling the fire spread. Tang et al.
[297] found that the maximum total heat flux almost coincided with the
location at which the flame detached from the near-adiabatic  ground
surface (i.e., where the local Richardson number Rix=1), using a 5×25
cm propane gas burner with an unheated segment. Furthermore, Ju et al.
[298]  determined  the  heat  transfer  mechanisms  to  the  ground  by
quantifying  the  radiative  and  convective  heat  fluxes  separately  using
propane and methane as fuels. The normalized local flame thickness δ*

was a power function of the number Grx2/Rex1
to describe the mixed convection that characterizes the interaction be-

wise scale from the leading edge of the unheated segment and x2 is the
streamwise scale from the leading edge of the burner. The local radiation
was  quantified  well  using  δ*

measuring  both the  flame  sag and  the  flame  base  drag, and  more re-
petitive large-scale field tests should thus be conducted to validate the
correlations presented in Table 8 in future work.

3.5.4. Flame instability

In  windless  conditions,  the  flame  instability primarily  is  governed
primarily by the R-T instability because of the entrained air flow, which
is  driven  by  buoyancy.  The  essence  of  this  instability  arises  from  a
density  deficiency.  Under  the  action  of  wind,  however,  Kelvin-
Helmholtz  (K-H)  instability8  occurs  where  there  is  a  velocity  differ-
ence across the interface between the airflow and the flame. Addition-
ally, flame instabilities are induced by the formation and inhibition of

the vortices and affects the production/dissipation of vorticity.  1
∇p is the baroclinic term that occurs because of misalignment between
the pressure and density gradients. If wind blows at a pool fire, hori-
zontal  vorticity  is  generated  as  ∇ × (∇⋅τ)/ρ  because  of  viscous  shear
stress  [257].  The  last  term  on  the  RHS  of  Eq.  (3-63)  represents  the
change in the vorticity field due to external body forces, e.g., gravity.

Under the action of wind, the vorticity may be transported by the
wind from one location to another, reoriented from one axis to another
(e.g., a horizontal vortex could be tilted to become a vertical vortex) or
intensified  because  of  flow  convergence,  which  stretches  the  vortex
[257,299,300]. In the vicinity of a wind-blown full-scale refinery fire, it
was  established  that  intense  atmospheric  vortices  or  even  fire  whirls
may  occur  downwind  of  the  fire  [301],  which  confirms  that  the  fire
dynamics of wind-blown pool fire plumes represent a sophisticated issue
that must be addressed clearly. Herein, we focus mainly on the recent
advances in studies of the instability of the pool fire flame itself in the
following, including flame streak, the flame oscillation frequency, and
the formation of fire whirls.

Although wind-aided diffusion pool fires have been investigated for
decades  by  the  scientific community, the  aerodynamic  structures and
the instability of the boundary layer combustion have not been under-
stood  fully  to  date.  In  large-scale  wildland  fires  and  laboratory-scale
pool fire tests, researchers observed the type of saw-toothed flame ge-
ometry shown in Fig. 40(a)and (b) under windy conditions. However,
the physical mechanisms that act to establish this attractive phenome-
non  have  not  been  identified  satisfactorily.  Commonly,  the  boundary
layer flow represents a 3D issue, that involves coherent structures and
vortices  with  varied  spatial  orientations.  Miller  et  al.  [302]  proposed
that  this  laminar  flame  structure  is  the  manifestation  of  perturbation
induced by streamwise counter-rotating vortices that lift the flame in the
upwash  regions  and  suppress  the  flame  in  the  downwash  regions,  as
shown in Fig. 40(c). This is similar to the G ̈ortler instabilities [303] that
appear within a boundary when forming over a concave wall that are
caused by the counter-rotating streamwise vortices.

Furthermore, Miller et al. [302,305] performed systematic investi-
gation of the onset of the coherent structures, the controlling mecha-
nisms, and the local gas temperature and heat flux distributions to the
surface, using rectangular gaseous pool fires stabilized within a laminar
boundary layer. The formation of flame streaks was found to be strongly
dependent on the development of the velocity boundary layer, which
was  also  studied  by  varying  the  unheated  length  located  prior  to  the
diffusion  burner  [305].  Additionally,  the  flame  streaks  appeared  to
amplify and aggregate downstream of the fire, and it was suggested that
this  streak  amplification  was  compatible  with  the  growth  of
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (RTIs). The streak spacing was observed to
have a lognormal distribution [304]. Temperature mapping indicated a
temperature  rise  in  the  flame  streaks,  while  the  temperature  in  the
troughs (i.e., the locations between the flame streaks) was found to be
reduced. The heat flux received by the surface also appeared to decrease
below  the  streaks  and  increase  beneath  the  troughs  because  of  the
various  standoff  distances  involved  [302].  This  instability  affects  the
spanwise distribution of the internal flame gas temperature and the heat
transfer  on  the surface  dramatically.  However,  the  phenomena above
could only be produced in laminar boundary layers, and flame streaks
will  require  further  examination  in  well-characterized  turbulent

boundary layers in future work.

The wind-blown pool fire oscillation frequency is another important
characteristic that is related to the fluid instability aspect. To date, only
one study with regard to the diffusion flame oscillation frequency when
subjected  to  wind  is  available  in  the  literature.  Inspired  by  the  more
classical  work  of  Cetegen  in  still  air  [259],  Fang  et  al.  [306]  used
stainless steel cylindrical propane burner with five diameters of 0.05 m,
0.075 m, 0.106 m, 0.13 m, and 0.15 m at wind speeds of up to 2.6 m/s to
investigate  the  buoyant  diffusion  flame’s  oscillatory  frequency  in  a
crosswind. From a phenomenological perspective, it was speculated that
air entrainment has a decelerating effect on the axial velocity of the fire
that has a complex impact on the convection time scale related to the
puffing frequency. By combining the effects of buoyancy acceleration,
entrainment  deceleration,  and  the  friction  force  on  the  axial  fuel  ve-
locity, a kinematic model of the oscillation frequency was deduced by
introducing a buoyancy and friction force related coefficient, along with
a decay coefficient that considers the air entrainment deceleration of the
axial velocity.

where Cw is the buoyancy and friction force-related coefficient, f is the
flame oscillation frequency, the Ri = (ρ∞ /ρf
f , and uf  is the
fuel  exit  velocity.  This  predictive  model  was  validated  by  showing
reasonable agreement with experimental results. The wind-blown flame
frequency was found to increase as the velocity ratio of the wind to the
fuel mass flow increased. The decay coefficient is less than unity, thus
ensuring  longer  flow  times,  which  allows  this  model  to  have  a  good
predictive  capability.  However,  it  may  be  necessary  to  examine  the
scaling  effect  on  pool  fire  instabilities  further,  along  with  various
crosswind turbulence intensities, and other associated factors.

Fire  whirl  would  also  emerge  when  wind  coalesce  over  a  self-
sustaining source, such as a fire plume. Byram et al. [307] found that
the three essential factors for fire whirl generation are: the presence of
an eddy-generating (vorticity) mechanism, the existence of a fluid sink
caused by a fire, and a surface drag force or friction that forms an air
inflow boundary layer. Pool-based flames are used widely to generate

stable and quasi-steady on source fire whirls when the right combination
of fire and air swirling circulation interplay, e.g., the fire whirls formed
in  enclosed  laboratory  apparatus  for  scale  modeling.  A  concentrated
flaming vortex column based on a pool fire emerges when obstacles are
placed to induce tangential motion of the entrained air, e.g., when using
four walls with slits [308], two half-cylinders offset with slits [309,310],
or  a  circular  intake  [307]  in  the  laboratory.  Alternatively,  uniform
swirling circulation can be produced by a moving screen using rotating
mesh setup [311]. Fire whirls may also be formed using an L-shaped fire
under crossflow conditions [312,313] or multiple discrete pool fires in
either windless or windy conditions [314], where any asymmetry in the
geometry or flow may cause or amplify the swirling motion. As shown in
Eq. (3-63), the underlying physics of the pool-based fire whirl can be
attributed to the tilting and stretching processes in a non-uniform ve-
locity field. In addition, under the imposed circulation conditions, the

4. Soot and flame radiation

4.1. Radiation models

Flame radiation is a fundamental mode of heat transfer for pool fires.
The rate at which the fuel evaporates from practical large scale pool fires
is usually dominated by radiation. At the same time, the pool fire radi-
ative heat flux also poses the principal hazard to the environment sur-
rounding  the  fire.  Both  the  luminous  and  non-luminous  radiation
contribute to radiative heat transfer from a pool fire. With regard to a
typical hydrocarbon pool fire composed of multiple gaseous species, the
most important contributors to the non-luminous radiation are carbon
dioxide and water vapor because of their high concentrations and high
temperatures in the flame. This is particularly true for small-sized pool
fires, in which the radiation comes predominantly from the combustion
gases, which emit within specific wavelength ranges. For intermediate/
large-sized  pool  fires,  luminous  radiation  becomes  a  more  significant
contributor to the emission. Small unburnt particles called soot due to

incomplete combustion contribute significantly to the light emission and
thus to the radiation of the flames [32,317].

Theoretically,  gaseous  radiation  is  produced  by  different  types  of
transitions between the molecule energy states, particularly for the vi-
bration rotation states. Tien [318] and de Ris [319] both reviewed the
various approaches used to predict the non-luminous radiation. In an
early work, Hottel et al. [320] prepared total emissivity charts for both
H2O and CO2. Characteristics for each ray could be estimated for ho-
mogeneous gases in terms of their temperatures, pressures and long path
lengths  based  on  the  charts  of  the  emissivity  results.  However,  for
non-homogeneous gases or mixtures of more than two gas species, these
empirically-based chart results proved rather less accurate for emissivity
estimation.  The  mean  spectral  emissivity  could  be  calculated  over  a
small  frequency  range  using  the  narrow-band  models  to  provides  a
fundamental basis for inhomogeneous radiation scenarios, from which
two typical methods, the Elsasser model and the statistical model were
developed [318]. This approach divides the spectrum into a specified
number of narrow bands within which the relevant properties can then
be estimated. By assuming that the spectral lines are spaced equally and
have identical profiles, and by taking the absorption coefficient for lines
with Lorentz profile into account, the mean emissivity Elsasser band can
be expressed as [318]:

where ωa is the angular frequency, kωa is the absorption coefficient for
lines having the Lorentz profile, and X is the mass path length. In the
statistical  model,  each  radiating  species  spectrum  was  divided  into
multiple  small  intervals  while  assuming  that  the  spectral  lines  have
random  spacings  with  exponentially  decaying  strength  distributions,
and the spectral emissivity is given by

massive  amounts  of  input  data  and  computing  time  required  make  it
impractical to apply this model in practice, particularly when the flame
gases of  pool fire may be highly nonuniform in terms of species con-
centration and temperature.

The exponential wide-band model developed by Edwards et al [321,
322]  offers  a  relatively  simple  and  accurate  method  to  estimate  the
combustion gases, and can even be extended to several inhomogeneous
scenarios  in  pool  fires.  Based  on  the  assumption  of  an  exponential
function  of  the  line  intensity  around  the  band  center,  the  individual
spectral  lines  within  the  vibrational  bands  are  each  connected  to
different rotational transitions, and the intensities and positions of these
rotational  lines  within  each  wide  band  with  a  constant  γ1/d  and  an
exponentially varying Zs/d can be given by

constant  (0.577).  Improved  parameters  were  provided  for  the  pure
rotational band of water vapor by Modak [323], and the discrete transfer
method was applied successfully to flames by Fairweather et al. [324].
Cumber et al. [325] calculated the results by dividing the spectrum into
a specified number of intervals and obtaining the transmittance for each
interval from the spectral transmittance directly. In 2002, the wide-band
correlated k-distribution method was found [326] to be the best method
in  terms  of  the  computational  accuracy  and  the  time  required.  The
wide-band  model  appears  to  offer  advantages  over  the  more  detailed
narrow-band statistical model, which is highly promising for treatment
of the heterogeneous gas mixtures that are commonly observed in pool
fire scenarios.

For participating molecular gases such as H2O and CO2, their emis-
sion  and absorption rates will increase in proportion  to their concen-
trations,  and  thus  in  proportion  to  the  mixture  pressure,  and  their
spectral properties will therefore vary with the pressure. The spectral
line  broadening  is  governed  by  molecular  collisions  that  are  propor-
tional to the total pressure, and thus it can be deduced that a narrower
line  profile  may  occur  under  low  air  pressure,  making  the  gas  more
“non-gray.”

Apart from the non-luminous emissions from the gases in the flame,
luminous  radiation  from  incandescent  soot  particulates  in  the  flame
occurs prior to the other radiations, particularly for practical large-scale
hydrocarbon pool fires. The soot, temperature and other gaseous species
distributions in turbulent flames are highly heterogeneous and fluctuate
violently in both their spatial and temporal distributions. The soot ra-
diation is largely dependent on the pool size, as predicted based on the
optical  properties,  shapes,  and  size  distributions  of  the  soot.  A  broad
range  of  progressive  studies  related  to  the  soot  structures  in  low-
momentum  diffusion  flames  (i.e.,  in  pool  fires)  were  conducted  by
Faeth et al. [327–334], who provided a set of important data for radi-
ative transport behavior estimation. The soot formed inside the flame
indicated that flame was separated into two regions: a fuel-rich region
and a fuel-lean region. The soot in the fuel-lean region appears to be
independent  of  the  position  and  the  flame  residence  time,  and  varies
with the fuel type. The soot refractive indices were found to be inde-
pendent of the fuel type in the visible and infrared spectral wavelengths
in the fuel-lean regions of pool fires.

Many experiments demonstrated that the total non-gray soot emis-
sion from a luminous pool fire could be simplified greatly by using a
simple gray expression [3,20,32,256,319,335,336], which simplifies the
3-D non-uniform pool fire (including its temperature and species con-
centration) into an equivalent fire with uniform properties,

εs = 1 (cid:0) e(cid:0) κlm ,

(4-5)

where lm is the mean beam length or pathlength and κ is the mean soot
spectral absorption-emission coefficient. For an arbitrarily shaped gas
volume, lm=3.6Vf/Ae, where Vf  is the  flame volume and  Ae  the flame
surface envelop. In the optically-thick case, Eq. (4-5) reduces to εs= 1,
while Eq. (4-5) reduces to εs= κlm for the optically-thin case when using
Taylor’s  expansion.  A  fiber-optic  absorption  probe  was  devised  by
Markstein [337] to gauge both the distribution of κ and the soot volume
fraction.  In  addition,  the  reports  of  Bouhafid  [336]  and  Gritzo  [152]
provided absorption coefficient data from lab-scale and large-scale pool
fire tests, because this wavelength-dependent parameter varied signifi-
cantly for the large-scale tests. Note that the sizes of the pseudo-fractal
aggregates  of  spherical  soot  particles  range  from  a  few  hundred  to  a
(cid:0) 1 nm), and the interplay between the
few thousand angstroms (1Å=10
soot  particles and the electromagnetic waves when the dimensionless
size parameter 0.3 < α = 2πR/λw<10 has been demonstrated well using
Mie theory [318,338]. In the flame, when it is assumed that the spherical
aggregate is not so large that α = 2πR/λw ≪ 1, the Rayleigh limit is then

The soot formation in the underfired (fuel-rich) and overfired (fuel-
lean) regions of turbulent non-premixed diffusion flames in still air was
investigated comprehensively by Sivathanu and Faeth [330,331]. Soot
generation  efficiencies  increased  up  to  an  asymptotic  value  with
increasing  residence  time  in  the  overfired  region,  and  strong  correla-
tions were found between fv  and the temperature in the underfired re-
gion. In [339], the effect of a turbulent flow field on the flame radiation
was  discussed,  and  the  Kolmogorov  time  rather  than  the  macroscale
time  of  the  turbulence  was  determined  to  control  soot  formation  in
turbulent flames, together with the reciprocal of the chemical formation
time scale. By substituting approximate values for η and k into Eq. (4-6),
the value of κ could be simplified to be

absorption-emission coefficients for typical and commonly used fuels.

Sootier flames were considerably more gray than the flames obtained
from clean burning fuels such as methane. For the gray-soot approxi-
mation that is widely used in calculation of the radiation in pool fire
scenarios, the homogeneous gas-soot mixture emissivity of a luminous
flame can be simplified further to be [318]

ε = εs + exp((cid:0) κsXs)εg,

or ε = εs + εg (cid:0) εsεg.

(4-9)

(4-10)

εs is the solely soot emissivity, εg is the gas emissivity in the absence of
soot,  and  the  subscript  s  denotes  the  soot.  This  approach  greatly
simplified  the  emissivity  calculation  and  gave  results  that  agreed
excellently with those obtained from a gaseous pool fire diffusion flame
in  [340].  A  comparison  plot  that  incorporates  the  results  from  exact
narrow-band  calculations  [342],  the  exponentially  wide-band  model
[323],  a  generalization  of  the  Leckner  model  [343],  and  a  modified
Taylor and Foster narrow-band model coupled with the soot-gas mixture
emissivity [344] presented in Fig. 41.

It could be argued that the flame emissivity increases with a longer
path length that is related to the pool size, i.e., a greater pool size gives a
greater path length. The good agreement among these models justified
the  applicability  of  the  homogeneous  grey  model,  although  it  was
apparent  that it  was  not  necessary  to  perform  extensive spectral  soot
calculations.  In  addition  to  this,  determination  of  more  complex  and
accurate  methods  including  a  method  to  assess  the  non-gray  soot
behavior when the path is non-homogeneous and a study of the varia-
tions in temperature and pressure along the path length (i.e., in large-
scale pool fires) will be of major  importance for prediction of the lu-
minous flame emissivity in pool fire research.

To understand the homogeneous flame radiation characteristics of a
pool fire, it is essential to know both the Schmidt temperature and the
flame emissivity. Assuming that the flame of a pool fire is both homo-
geneous and isothermal, the temperature can be measured reliably by
placing  a  black  body source  behind the  flame  and  then  adjusting the
source  temperature  until  the  intervening  flame  neither  adds  nor  sub-
tracts  from  the  measured  radiance,  thus  simulating  an  infinite  flame
path length [4]. The measured Schmidt temperatures or effective flame
radiation  temperatures  of  turbulent  pool  fire  flames  generally  range
between 1200 K and 1500 K, with lower temperatures for sootier flames
[161].  In  addition  to  the  previous  methods  for  approximation  of  the
flame  emissivity,  some  experimental  methodologies  to  measure  the
emissivity are also available.

′′/  ̇m

Recently, several approaches to the measurement of flame emissivity
were  reviewed  by  Raj  [345,346]  and  Parent  et  al.  [347],  and  were
divided into four classes. In the first approach, the emissivity is related
to  the  energy  balance  at  the  fuel  surface  and  the  emissivity  can  be
calculated  based  on  the  ratio  of  the  mass  loss  rate  of  a  specific
large-diameter pool fire that is radiation-dominated to the mass loss rate
′′
of a pool fire of infinite diameter, i.e., ε =  ̇m
∞. In the second method,
the  global  emissivity  of  the  flame  can  be  obtained  using  the
Stefan-Boltzmann  law  by  measuring  the  flame  temperature  and  the
flame irradiance, as follows: ε =  ̇
q′′/σT4
f F. In the third method, the flame
emissivity can also be inferred by bridging the relationship between the
emissivity and the flame transmittance τf, where ε = 1 (cid:0)
τf. Using the
infrared thermography technique, the flame is positioned with reference
to various heaters. The fourth approach involves the use of a two-color
pyrometer, multi-color pyrometry, or even the hyper-spectral imaging
technique.  For  example,  gray  flame  emissivity  of  is  assumed  for  the
two-color  pyrometer  method,  and  the  object  temperature  is  then
determined from the radiation ratio at the two intensities. However, the
earlier methodologies are incapable of showing the spatial and temporal
variation of emissivity in pool fires. In the most recent work involving
the 3rd method [345,346], 40 horizontal electrically heated strips were

used to produce the flame spatial emissivity and temperature distribu-
tions. The emissivity was observed to decrease from the flame base to-
ward  the  flame  tip  for  pool  fires  with  various  diameters  and  fuel
properties [348,349], and this was attributed to the change in the flame
thickness (i.e., the optical thickness) along the pool fire’s axial distance.
The  spatial-temporally  averaged  flame  emissivity  distribution  was
measured using the third method described above by Raj [346], who
used diesel and gasoline pool fires with size of 0.3–1.0 m. The radial
variations in the flame emissivity reached a peak value at the flame base
center  line, while  the  emissivity decreased radially  outward from the
center.

Most hydrocarbon fuel pool fires will become optically-thick when
the  pan  size  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  3  m  [11,32]  (where  flame
thickness is equal to several meters). Spectrally resolved measurements
were recently used to describe the spectral dependence of the soot ra-
diation in pool fires and to provide a method for determination of the
optically-thick limit for a given fuel. The equivalent absorption coeffi-
cient  and  the  equivalent  temperature  were  determined  by  using  two
measurement  techniques, multispectral opacimetry and infrared spec-
trometry,  respectively, for  kerosene pool  fires  (0.3–2.5  m)  [347].  Ac-
cording to the measurement principle that the intensity received from a
light  source  behind  the  pool  fire  is  divided  by  the  intensity  received
directly from the light source without the flame, opacimetry measure-
ments are performed as illustrated in Fig. 42(a). The spectral radiative
intensities  were  evaluated  using  a  Fourier  transform  infrared  (FTIR)

emission spectrometer over the range from 800 cm
this  manner,  the  equivalent  absorption  coefficient  was  found  to  be
almost independent of both the fire size, as illustrated in Fig. 42(b) and
(c),  and  the  effective  radiation  temperature.  These  results  confirmed
that the radiation that emanates from flame is not grey and appears to be
black  only  for  very  large  pan  sizes,  i.e.,  greater  than  1.75  m,  which
validates  the  measurement  results  for  the  flame  emissivity  variation
versus  path  length  shown  in  Fig.  41  using  the  new  measurement

techniques  to  some  extent.  In  future  work,  development  of  more
specialized techniques will be helpful in capturing the emission spectra
of pool fire flames to enable further correction of the related radiation
models.

4.2. Radiative heat flux transfer to nearby targets

The flame geometries and emissivity properties have been described
in  detail  in  the  preceding  sections.  By  coupling  these  important  pa-
rameters with nearby objects exposed to the unwanted pool fire, various
schemes were then proposed to compute the thermal radiation field of
the fire. Assessment of the external flame radiation is essential for both
the design of the safe distance and the establishment of standards in fire
safety engineering guidance. Two of the most widely used conventional
models for pool fires, i.e., the single point source (SPS) model and the
solid flame model, have been applied successfully to predict the thermal
radiation in accordance with specific scenario [32,88,121,350].

In the SPS model, the flame radiation is often supposed to concen-
trate  at  the  centroid  of  the  flame,  with  the  emissive  output  being
isotropic. As part of the total combustion heat release rate, the energy
that is radiated toward external targets varies inversely with the square
of the distance from the flame source. Expressed mathematically, if the
combustion  efficiency  is  assumed  to  be  100%,  then  the  radiation  in-
tensity at any distance from the fire point is written as,

 ̇q′′

where τ is the atmospheric transmissivity over the distance x, and θ is
the angle between the radiometer (receiver) surface normal and the line
of sight to the center point. Although the SPS model provides an elegant
and simplified method to estimate the thermal radiation in the far-field,
it is actually overly conservative, in that its accuracy does not extend to
the near-field within a few pool diameters. Modak reported that the true
value of the thermal radiation would be underestimated by more than

25% within half the pool diameter when using the SPS model [88]. The
single-location radiative heat flux measurement method for estimation
of  the  radiation  heat  loss  fraction  (χr)  was  confirmed  to  be  viable  by
Hamins [351], for medium-scale pool fires (4.6–30 cm) with eight types
of fuel, as long as the measurement conditions were satisfied that the
location should be positioned at a distance of more than five radii from
the source center, normal to the flame axis, and at the 40% flame height.
The solid flame model [350] is widely used and idealizes the flame
using solid, well-defined cylindrical or cuboid shapes such that the en-
velope serves as a uniformly gray emitter. Parameters such as the base
and the length of the flame are required to resolve the model problem,
along  with  the  emissive  power.  In  addition,  the  varying  radiation  in-
tensity  along  the  flame  length  can  also  be  estimated.  The  liberated
thermal radiation on the exterior targets could be expressed as,

 ̇q′′

r = τERF,

(4-12)

where ER is the emissive power averaged across the flame envelope, F is
the geometric view factor, and τ is the atmospheric transmissivity. Note
that if the distance from the source is large, then the radiation will be
partially attenuated by scattering and absorption along the intervening
path, in which carbon dioxide and water vapor are the prime constitu-
ents that contribute to τ [32,352]. The geometrical configuration factor
F subsumes the pool fire shape, volume, and the relative position be-
tween the flame and the target surface. Several commonly used methods
are available to estimate F, including the direct integration approach,
the  contour  integral  model  [353],  the  cross-string  method  [320],  the
algebraic analytical method, and the Monte Carlo approach [354,355].
Closed form solution for some specific configurations of the view factor
can also be found in [352,356,357].

Recently,  a  new  method  called  the  weighted  multi-point  source
(WMP) model has been used to estimate the  flame radiation by Han-
kinson and Lowesmith [358], and has been shown to be accurate in its
prediction of both the near-field and far-field measurements. This model
was  motivated  by  the  fact  that  both  the  flame  width  and  the  soot
composition vary along the axial direction of the pool fire flame as a
result of the complex air-fuel turbulent mixing process. This method has
subsequently  been  extended  to  model  buoyant  turbulent  line-source
pool  fires  [49]  and  circular  pool  fires  [48].  The  multi-point  source
model  can  be  adapted  to  model  the  incident  radiation  from  a  repre-
sentative pool fire in still air, as illustrated in Fig. 43, by assuming that

tion received at the radiometer is calculated as a weighted vector sum of

where wi is the weight of the ith point source, Si is the distance from the
gauge  surface  to  the  ith  point,  θi  is  the  angle  between  gage  surface
normal and the line of sight to the ith point source, and τi  is the trans-
missivity  over  the  distance.  To  assign  the  weight  profile,  each  point
weight can be estimated using a narrow view angle radiometer or slit
radiometer measurement results, or the profile could be estimated based
on by the previous experimental data. Cook et al. [359] reported that the
flame radiation tends to increase to a maximum at approximately 75% of
the flame height for jet fires. Markstein [360] observed an asymmetric
bell-shaped curve distribution for a gaseous propane pool-like diffusion
flame with its peak occurring at approximately 45% of the flame height.
Furthermore, the hierarchical flame centerline temperature and emis-
sivity distributions along the flame axis were used to predict the heat
fluxes  imposing  on  the  external  targets  more  accurately  [361],  upon
which the multi-layer cylindrical flame model was based. In [194], the
emissivity was estimated as an exponential function of the heat release
rate  and  used  to  calculate  the  radiative  heat  fluxes  toward  the  sur-
rounding objects.

The thermal radiation heat flux and fraction (i.e., the fraction of the
total heat release rate that is emitted by radiation), which characterize
the energy transfer capabilities of fire to its surroundings, are essential
parameters when describing the thermal hazards of pool fires. Fig. 44
shows radiation fraction data collected from lab-scale (<0.3 m) to large-
scale (>10 m) pool fires between 1989 and 2015. The radiative fractions
of hydrocarbon fuels level off at around 0.4–0.5 when the pool diameter
is smaller than 5 m, as illustrated in Fig. 44. The broad spectrum of the
data suggested that the fraction of the total rate of heat release that is
emitted as radiation remains proportional to the fuel supply rate (or the
HRR) for scaled buoyant diffusion flames [32]. de Ris et al. [319] argued
that the radiation fraction for optically-thin geometrically similar flames
should be nearly constant, as depicted in Fig. 44, because of the burning
that  occurs  on  the  invariant  Kolmogorov  scale.  Therefore,  the  flame
radiation  fraction,  as  an  intrinsic  characteristic  of  chemically  similar
fuels,  is  determined  by  the  nature  of  thermochemistry.  Subsequently,
results have shown that the total radiative fraction is governed by smoke
point flame length (lsp) by independently controlling the adiabatic flame

fraction  would  become  slightly  smaller/larger  with
decreasing/increasing pressure. This behavior is attributed to the soot-
ing  tendency  that  occurs  under  various  atmospheric  pressure,  which
could be also explained by Markstein’s [256] result, where

χr ∼

,

(4-16)

where the flame temperature is enhanced at low pressures because of the
weakened  air  entrainment.  Tad  represents  the  flame’s  adiabatic  tem-
perature.  Most  and  Hu  et  al.  [215,368]  observed  a  very  slightly
decreasing tendency with increasing pressure when χr~P0.1. Fang [369]
indicated  that  the  relationship  of  the  flame  radiation  fraction  to  the
pressure can be expressed in the form of χr~P0.185. Liu et al. [132] tested
a  series  of  n-heptane  pool  fires  ranging  from  of  4–10  cm  at
sub-atmospheric pressures and found that the radiation fractions of the
tested pool fires showed weak dependences on both the pressure and the
pool diameter, where χr~P0.3-0.175AD0.15 (A is the empirical index given
in Table 3). These results will provide further guidance with regard to
the  detection  of  incipient  fires  in  sub-atmospheric  pressure  environ-
ments.  In  addition,  the  fuel  type  showed  certain  influences  on  the
pressure effect in terms of its carbon content or soot formation capacity.
The soot formation capacity was proposed to be proportional to the soot
residence  time  scale  and  to  the  reciprocal  of  the  soot  formation  time
scale  by  Delichatsios  and  Orloff  [362],  and  its  dependence  on  the
pressure can be described as [137]:

κ ∼ τk

/
τc ∼ P2 ∼ D(cid:0) 1,

(4-17)

where  τk  is  the  turbulent  Kolmogorov  microscale  time  (the  soot  resi-
dence time), and τc  is the soot formation/oxidation kinetic time. This
equation indicates that the soot will be reduced at lower pressures or
when using low carbon content fuels (e.g., methanol). As demonstrated
via  comparison  tests  [137],  methanol  does  not  readily  achieve
radiation-controlled burning even for large scale fire due to small soot
yield, which is not suitable for radiation fire modeling.

Recently,  based  on the  SPS model, the  radiation  fraction of  wind-
blown medium-scale liquid pool fires that used n-heptane and acetone
as fuels under both standard- and sub-atmospheric conditions were first
measured and reported in [40], with the results indicating that the value
of  χr  under  windy  conditions  is  lower  than  the  corresponding  value
under quiescent conditions; additionally, the values of χr under normal
pressure  conditions  are  relatively  larger  than  the  values  under
sub-atmospheric conditions, as shown in Fig. 46. The decreasing relation

locities (i.e., the liquid pool fire flame length L is elongated under wind
[101]) and under sub-atmospheric conditions because of the soot for-
mation time τc ~ ρ-1. Additionally, it could also be explained that χr ~
(cid:0) 0.5  drops  under  sub-atmospheric  conditions  because  of  the  higher
L
flame  length  that  occurs  in  still  air,  as  noted  in  section  3.2.  A
non-dimensional correlation was also proposed to characterize the flame
radiation  fraction  relative  to  the  wind  speed  under  both  normal- and
sub-atmospheric pressures:

The fraction of the combustion energy released by a large-scale pool
fire  that  is  radiated  (i.e.,  the  radiation  fraction)  will  be  influenced
significantly by smoke obscuration effects (see Fig. 44). The core region
of a large-scale pool fire was broken down into two regions [121], with a

combination  for  both  free-burning  laminar  and  turbulent  diffusion
flames  [256,362-364], which  can be  correlated well by  the following
expression:

χr = 0.43 (cid:0) 0.19lsp.

(4-14)

Most of the models described above were proposed with respect to
either  small-  or  medium-scale  pool  fires.  However,  thermal  radiation
prediction  still  involves  considerable  uncertainty.  In  reality,  the
combustible  gases  and  liquids  that  burning  large-scale  pool  fires
generate large quantities of cooler black smoke that mostly obscures the
thermal radiation  in the external surface from the plume  (i.e., smoke
blockage occurs [11]) preventing it from impinging on the surroundings
and on humans. Two physical phenomena were proposed to explain the
amounts  of  smoke  generated  [365].  The  first  is  a  lack  of  sufficient
oxidant within the core region of the large-scale pool to burn the soot
generated by condensed-fuel pyrolysis, while the second phenomenon is
the recirculation of the burnt gas that is induced by the toroidal vortex
that  prevails  in  large-scale  fires,  which  reduces  the  effective  concen-
trations of the fuel and the vapor in the core. These effects lead to the
obvious observation that the radiation fraction declines with increasing
pool diameter when D≥5 m, although increased emissivity is associated
with the smoke. For a non-luminous methyl alcohol pool fire [111,366],
χr is less than approximately 0.2.

Additionally, an extensive number of works has been reported in the
literature with regard to the flame radiation fractions of pool fires under
different  ambient  pressures  conditions  [40,128,132,215].  As  noted  in
section 2.3, the air pressure primarily affects the flame characteristics by
influencing  the  buoyancy  induced  air  entrainment  and  the  chemical
reaction rate, thus causing the soot formation. As illustrated in Fig. 45,
Gülder et al. measured laminar diffusion flames soot concentrations at
high  pressures  of  up  to  60  atm  in  2011  [367].  They  found  that  the
pressure  dependence  of  the  maximum  soot  yield  shows  a  noticeable
power  law  relationship  at  lower  pressures,  but  it  reaches  a  plateau
asymptotically  when  the  pressure  increases  further,  particularly  for
gaseous methane fuel.

Radiation fire modeling theory indicated that the radiation fraction

is not sensitive to pressure because [137],

where τs is the transmissivity of the smoke, Cs is the mass concentration

mean beam length. At the same time, the pool scale dependence on the
average  emissive  powers  of  large-scale  pool  fire  of  ≥1  m  in  size  was
summarized in the work of Munoz et al. [119,371], which is illustrated
in Fig. 47. The results show that the average emissive power begins to
decrease at a diameter of 6 m, which probably occurs because the lu-
minous flame surface area gradually decreases as the pan size increase.
Despite the lack of data for larger pool fires (i.e., with diameters ≥ 6 m),
it  could  still  be  postulated  that  the  average  emissive  power  Eave  will
continue to decrease as the pan size increases further as a result of Es
being dominant, similar to the trend predicted by Mudan [32]. To ac-
count for the absorption and the emission in both the optically-thin and
optically-thick regions, a grey gas thermal radiation model was devel-
oped by Fay [373]. This model produced a local flame surface emissive
power that varied monotonically with the combusting flame height, and
achieved at a maximum within the visible fire plume region. However,
the intimately coupled turbulence and radiation problem for large-scale
pool fires remains still very challenging to model and will require further
and more vigorous exploration.

5. Multi-pool-fire interactions

5.1. Flame merging dynamics

Multiple fire sources are usually involved in realistic fire scenarios, e.
g., in pool fires in refineries or in wildland fires, which might lead to the
fires merging or produce even more disastrous hazards. The occurrence
of  fire  disasters  can  be  mitigated  via  an  enhanced  understanding  of
multi-fire  dynamics  and  subsequent  application  of  this  knowledge.
When pool fire converged burning occurs within the proximity of other
fires, the burning characteristics of the pool fires will be altered signif-
icantly because of the complex interactions involved [50]. Even in the
simplest  burning  scenario  composed  of  two  neighboring  symmetrical
pool  fires  (see  Fig.  48),  the  fluid  mechanisms  change  and  merging
mechanisms have essentially become the focus of research interest [314,
374-379].
coalescence  processes  of  multi
buoyancy-driven turbulent fire plumes were affected fundamentally by
the restriction of the air entrainment into each pool fire caused by the
presence of the other fires, which induced the pressure inhomogeneities
external to and inside the hot fluid. In other words, it represents a type of

luminous band located just above the pool surface (clear flame zone)
and an upper part that was shielded by appreciable amounts of smoke
(the smoky flame zone) [370,371]. However, all the released energy was
assigned  to the  first zone  because of the  lack of  a  smoky zone  in the
previous model, which may be questionable, as Raj indicated [120,365,
372]. The technique of splitting the fire into multiple zones based on
smoke  shielding  to  estimate  the  thermal  radiation  was  applied  in
large-scale field tests. An average surface emissive power of Eave  over
both the combusting flame zone and the smoky zone can be approxi-
mated as [291]:

Eave = χ0E0 + (1 (cid:0) χ0)Es,

(4-19)

where E0 is the emissive power of the nominal combusting flame surface
near its base, Es is the emissive power of the smoky zone, and χ0 is the
unobscured ratio of the entire fire plume.

Most recently, by superimposing infrared (IR, thermographic cam-
era)  and  visible  light  camera  (VHS)  images  [94,119],  a  method  was
developed  to  estimate  the  emanated  radiation  for  the  luminous  and
non-luminous portions of the flame. For the luminous part, the average
emissive  power,  which  is  both  fuel-  and  scale-dependent  is  approxi-
mately 80–120 kW/m2, while for the non-luminous part of the flame, a
constant emissive power of 40 kW/m2 is presumed. Raj [365] also gave
the effective emissive power of the smoke-obscured part as,

convection equivalent of the Coand ̆a effect9.

Critical  merging  conditions  are  prerequisites  or  multi-pool  fires
when  visibly  interacting.  Many  merging  criteria  have  been  derived
empirically.  Putnam [376] first reported the merging of multiple tur-
bulent diffusion flames (including circular arrays and linear arrays) by
adjusting the gaseous fuel flow rates and diameters. The mutual aspi-
rating  effects  of  the  flames  upon  one  another  reduced  the  effective
spacing among them, leading to the discrepancies between the analyt-
ical and experimental results. In addition, the critical merging separa-
tion  distances  (s)  was  given  to  be  roughly  double  the  pool  diameter.
Thomas  [380]  found  that the  criterion  for  merging  of  two  rectilinear
flames placed side by side merging is the ratio of the merging flame to
the isolated fire height, which was roughly equivalent to 6/5. A theo-
retical model was derived by Baldwin [377] for flame merging based
upon the premise that the pressure thrust was balanced by the buoyancy,
with  a  dependence  on  the  scales  of  the  flame  height,  fire  size  and
spacing:

where l, w, and s were the longer and shorter side lengths of the source,
and the separation distance, respectively. Liu et al. [314] found the onset
merging  distance  of  a  5-cm-diameter  n-heptane  pool  fire  array  was
approximately 40 cm regardless of the array sizes, which agreed with the
results presented by Satoh [378]. Additionally, the new critical condi-
tion for his experiments was estimated to be s/L0, which ranged from
approximately 0.29 to 0.34. The specific formulae or judgments used to
derive  these  critical  merging  conditions  were  different  in  each  case,
which may be because of the different fuels and pan shapes used and the
inexact  definition  of  fire  merging.  Correlations  were  proposed  by
Sch ̈alike  [379],  who  compared  the  results  of  both  lab-scale  tests  and
large-scale field tests to predict the critical distances for fully-merging
and part-merging conditions versus the pool fire numbers.

Over the past few years, the merging processes ranging from non-
merging to intermittent merging, and then full merging of double tur-
bulent diffusion flames as a function of the flame spacing have contin-
uously remained a subject of interest. A statistical method was proposed
by  Hu  et  al.  (2015)  [281]  to  analyze  the  merging  behavior  of  dual
ejecting  diffusion  fires  more  specifically  that  produced  a  piece-wise
function  for the  flame  merging  probability  (continuous regime,  inter-
mittent regime, and non-merging regime) obtained from video clips in
relation  to  the  normalized  characteristic  length  scales.  Subsequently,
Wan  et  al.  (2017)  [381]  and  Liu  et  al.  (2019)  [52]  also  used  similar
methods to quantify the flame interaction and merging behaviors in still
air,  of  which  the  Boltzmann  function  mentioned  in  [52]  could  also
correspond to the piece-wise function.

In the study of flame merging, the individual fires can be modelled as
point  sinks  of  fluid  using  potential  flow  theory.  When  two  pool  fires
converge, their independent entrainment flow fields also interact. Many
studies  of  flame  merging  behaviors  were  largely  about  fires  of  equal
sizes or with equal heat release rates, but the merging criteria that apply
for  unequal  fires  will  be  completely  different  because  of  the  distinct
potential flow fields (see Fig. 49) [382,383]. In 1986, Weihs et al. [383]
first explained the merging dynamics of unequal fires by presenting a
ground-level streamline and found that the smaller fire migrated toward
to the more intense fire. In 2016, the merging interaction between dual
line fires was interpreted successively by using potential flow10  theory
[382]. There is still a demand, however, for fundamental explicit gov-
erning  equations,  rather  than  empirical  formula  to  extrapolate  the
critical merging characteristics of pool fires systematically, which may
be proposed in the near future. Regardless, when the proximate fires are
in the presence of wind, their merging behaviors will be more complex
and more difficult to quantify. A recent study showed that the effect of
wind  is  conducive  to  the  merging  of  two  liquid  pool  fires  [97],  thus
enhancing the odds these fires having destructive potential.

5.2. Burning rate

For condensed-fuel pool fires, involvement of more fires in the flames
would enhance the vaporization rates or pyrolysis rates of the liquid/
solid fuels because of the strengthening of the heat feedback to the fuel
surface, which would contribute to the development of more dangerous
and more intense fires. Consequently, the burning rates of experimental
multiple pool fires were of sufficient concern to justify further extension
of  the  work  to  outdoor  pool/tank  fires  using  scaling  laws  [7].  The
burning  rates  in  pool  fire  arrays  are  dependent  on  the  fuel  type,  the
position of the pool fire in the array, and other factors.

The first systematic study to investigate the enhanced burning rates
of multiple pool fires in circular patterns was undertaken by Huffman
[384],  who  used  five  hydrocarbon  fuels.  For  luminous  flames,  the
burning rates of the outer burners were lower than those for the center
burners in most case, when interacting fires existed among them, with
results that were similar to those of Vincent’s study using octane, Jet-A
as the fuel [385]. In that study, the burning rate values were very close
when the separation distance was zero or far enough away to ensure that
the fires did not merge. The maximum of the center pool fire burning
rate  occurred  at  the  onset  of  multi-fires  merging.  For  non-luminous
flames  such  as  methanol-produced  pool  fires,  the  burning  rate  varia-
tions with spacing were smaller due to the weak interaction behaviors of
the fires. Generalized empirical correlations were derived for nine cir-
cular patterns for the center burner mass loss rate and the averaged mass
loss rate for all burners:

9  The Coand effect is the process whereby a plume adheres to a surface due to

interference by that surface on the entrainment into the flow.

10  Potential  flows  are  those  flow  situations  where  the  flow  is  taken  to  be
irrotational, such that the vorticity is zero throughout the flow field.

Here, BOT represents the burn-out time of each pool fire source, and
the subscript ref signified a single reference fire. As a result, the varia-
tions  in  the  global  burning  rates  were  attributed  to  the  competition
between  air  entrainment  restrictions  and  the  heat  feedback  enhance-
ment. Three regions were definitely distinguished using BR* versus the
fuel area ratio rs  while incorporating the spacing (s) and the fire array
size  (j),  where  rs  = j2πD2/4[D+(j(cid:0) 1)s]2.  Each  region  contained  given
interactions,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  50.  Subsequently,  the  fire  layer
concept was formulated [387] to enable tentative characterization of the
burning rates based on the BOT data from various spatial distributions of
fire points. Jiao et al. [15] measured the mass burning rate and the fuel
surface heat feedback for each small pan in a pool fire array, along with
the radial air flow velocity along the slot centerline related to the air
entrainment, and then semi-quantitatively interpreted the effects of air
entrainment and the heat feedback in multiple pool fires (MPFs). Their
results  showed  that  the  heat  feedback  from  the  center  fire  decreased
monotonically with increasing s/D when the air entrainment was suffi-
cient,  although  that  behavior  altered  non-monotonically  when  the
entrained air was restricted based on stagnant layer theory (Eqs. (2-9)~
(2-11)). In [388], the burning characteristics of lab-scale dual pool fires
mounted  in  different  planes/elevations  with  various  separation  dis-
tances  were  discussed,  with  results  that  indicated  that  the  upper  pan
burning rates were greater than those of the lower pans because of the
additional external radiative heat flux.

In addition to the MPFs in still air that were discussed above, and in
view of the practical conditions, multiple fires under windy conditions
should also be investigated. Experiments involving two proximate wood
cribs that were oriented parallel to the wind direction under the action
of wind, were performed by Rios [389]. The resulting burning rates for
the upstream and downstream fires were fitted well using the power law
for the flame zone depth. The results of recent research investigating two
symmetrical pool fires positioned side-by-side with a crosswind [390]
indicated that the peak value of the mass loss rate occurred when s/D
was in the range from 0.5–1.5. In addition, the mass loss rates for pool
fires  with  s=0  were  lower  than  that  of  a  single  wind-blown  pool  fire
when u was greater than a specified value; this arose from the strongly
restricted  air  entrainment.  Small  (10,  15  cm)  dual  ethanol  pool  fires
(1.25<s/D<3.75) under the action of a crosswind in a tunnel were also
investigated while considering the side-wall confinement effect [391].
The competing mechanisms of an increasing mass transfer coefficient (B
number) and a cooling effect that resulted from forced convection were
demonstrated  to  explain  the  variations  in  the  burning  rates,  with  the

than those of the outer fires [378], and of the rates of the corner fires in
the  majority  of  cases  in  square-positioned  n-heptane  pool  fire  arrays,
which was consistent with the results obtained for multiple sources of
wooden crib fires [386].

Following  application  of  the  dimensionless  interaction  index  and
interaction link analysis methods on which the burn-out time is based,
the  results  showed  that  the  interaction  between  the  corner  fires  and
adjacent fires occurred noticeably along the diagonal for a 5×5 array
[378]. In 2009, a method to describe the global burning rates (BR*) that
were  extracted  from  burn-out  time  data  [51]  also  showed  complex
variation of the burning rate with spacing and the pool fire array sizes,

maximum burning rate enhancement factor (the mean burning rate of an
interacting double pool/single pool) of approximately 2.3. Analysis of
multi-liquid  pool  fires  under  windy  conditions  when  configured  in
various  array  arrangements  will  still  be  challenging  in  the  future,
because they involve extremely complex interplay among the flow, heat
transfer, air-fuel mixing, and combustion processes.

5.3. Flame morphological characteristics

As mentioned earlier, enhancement of the burning rates will simul-
taneously  produce  attendant  change  in  the  flame  morphology,  for
instance,  with  the  most  notable  example being  a  higher  flame  height
being obtained even without the onset of merging. Given that the flame
height  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  mass  of  the  entrained  air,  the
diffusion flame height then also extends to entrain sufficient fresh air in
close proximity to the neighboring pool fire sources when they are either
partially- or fully-merging for gaseous fires with given fuel flow rates
[392,393].  The  sizes  of  the  pool  fires,  the  separation  distances,  the
dimensionless  heat  release  rate  and  the  flame  height  are  the  most
intuitive parameters with interdependencies, and they result in different
correlations.

Table  10  summarizes  a  variety  of  the  models  used  to  predict  the
heights  of  multiple  pool-configured  fires,  particularly  for  the  merged
flame cases. In 1963, Putnam et al. [376] first established modeling laws
for  arrays  of  gaseous  buoyancy-controlled  turbulent  flame  heights.
When the spacing among the fires is zero, the height ratio of the merging
flames to the isolated pool fire (Lm/Li) shows a -2/5 power dependence
on the total fire numbers. Lm/Li was also predicted as a function of Eq.
(5-4b),  in  the  circumstances  where  the  flames  had  just  merged.  An
equation was also derived [380] to investigate the merging flame height
characteristics of two rectilinear pool fires (using gaseous fuel to ensure
that the heat release rate was independent of the heat feedback to the
fuel surface) for which the flame tips were just touching. Consideration
of the flame motion and the air entrainment conditions then yielded Eq.
(5-5).  The merging  and  interacting  flame  heights  in  three  varied  sce-
narios  were  then  demonstrated,  including  dual  rectangular  pools

configured  in  parallel,  and  three  and  four  circular  pools  configured
symmetrically  [392].  The  ratio  of  L0/Li  scaled  with  respect  to  a  con-
trolling parameter in terms of the burner dimensions (l, w), the flame
separation  distance  (s),  and  the  total  number  of  fires  (m),  to  the   cth
power, where c is 2/5 for the circular/square pools and 2/3 for a rect-
angular pool. Weng et al.[394] proposed that a transitional separation
distance exists at which the flames did not merge for multiple gaseous
porous  burner  flames  arranged  in  a  square  configuration,  and  an
empirical model was developed to estimate the merged flame height (see
Eq. (5-7)). Additionally, the numerical results obtained when employing
FDS was compared with the calculated merged flame height results, and
showed good agreement for the 3×3 and 4×4 fire groups, but not for the
2×2 MPFs.

A correlation was derived based on the simple assumption that the
air entrainment was  proportional to the fuel’s  stoichiometric require-
ment for combustion (i.e,. the heat release rate) by Delichatsios [395]
for  group  fires  with  merging  flames.  Their  results  showed  [395]  that
non-dimensional group flame heights showed a 2/3-power law depen-
dence on the group fire heat release rate that coincided with classical

flame  height  theory  within  the  intermediate
range  as  shown  in
Fig.  23.  A  decade  later,  concerns  about  the  flame  morphologies  of
multiple pool fires, particularly with regard to the flame height, have
been raised again. Two adjacent interacting slot-burner diffusion flame
heights were investigated by performing a scaling analysis [396] based
on the change in the air entrainment into the flame from the space be-
tween the dual burners. A newly defined effective entrainment perim-
eter  (PL)  that  included  an  additional  flame  base  “extension”  was
introduced as a characteristic length scale in Eq. (5-9) to correlate the
flame  height.  Subsequently,  similar  experiments  were  performed  in
which two parallel-configured rectangular fires were divided into five
distinct interaction states (ranging from no interaction to fully mering)
[52]. L/D’ was then formulated as a power function of
for those five
states, in which the two flames were regarded as a whole. It should be
noted  that  the  power  exponent  was  2/3  for  states  I,  II,  and  V  (Eq.
(5-11a)), and ranged from 0.91 to 1.08 (greater than 2/3) in states III, IV
(Eq. (5-11b)) which may be attributed to the interaction of the flames as

they  started  to  merge.  By  introducing  a  parameter  called  the  air
entrainment  ratio  λent  when  s=0  and  s>0,  a  piece-wise  function  was
established for the flame height of two gaseous pool fires (Eq. (5-10))
with respect to the air entrainment condition [381].

In addition to the formulae used to delineate the flame heights of
equal group fires, the deflection of flames in close proximity toward each
other has also drawn attention. The reason for the onset of the merging
behavior  is  accompanied  by  inward  tilting  of  the  flames  toward  the
center is the pressure gradient field that occurs as a result of asymmetric
air  entrainment  [397].  In  1967,  Huang  and  Lee  [398]  proposed  a
dimensional analysis to correlate the inclinations of two reasonably long
and approximately parallel line fires with respect to burners’ heat fluxes
per unit length and the separation distance between the fires s:

φ = fcn(M1, M2),

M1 = Qt/Qa,

where Qt is the burner’s heat flux per unit length for the test flame, and
Qa is that of the auxiliary flame. Recently, a simple model was developed
to  explain  the  flame  tilting  angle  that  used  the  balance  between  the
horizontal and vertical forces acting on the flame control volume (CV),
by Maynard et al. in 2016 [382]:

where uv and uw are the horizontal and vertical velocity components, HP
and DP are the height and the width of the plume CV, and subscripts o, i,
and p represent the outboard, inboard and interior regions of the CV,
respectively. In the cases under the action of wind, the downstream pool
fire tilt angle was lower than the corresponding angle for upstream case
owing to the leading fire blockage effect, and the normalized diffusion
flame  tilt  angles  were  found  to  be  a  function  of  the  modified  Froude
number  u2/gs,  which  contained  a  separation  distance,  by  Rios  [389].
Based on the dynamics behaviors of two tandem pool fires under windy
conditions, four states were clearly categorized for the flame tilt angles
with regard to the momentum of the uprising thermal flame gas MVB,
the pressure thrust induced by the constrained air entrainment MVP, and
the momentum resulted from the wind MVI [97,399]. By far, most of the
models used to estimate the flame tilt angles were more or less empir-
ical,  which  means  that  a  deeper  understanding  and  more  detailed
studies will be necessary with regard to the measurement and visuali-
zation  of  the  flow  field surrounding  multiple  equal  [400–402] or  un-
equal [403] pool fires, especially in windy conditions [404,405].

6. Summary, challenges, and prospects

The canonical diffusion burning process of a pool fire brings together
chemistry, fluid dynamics, and heat and mass transfer, and the strong
coupling  among  these  aspect  results  in  the  high  complexity  of  this
fundamental  multidisciplinary  problem,  which  precludes  complete
mathematical/scaling  solutions.  Intensive  scientific  efforts  have  been
made in each of these individual fields over the past two decades. In this
review, contexts ranging from classical theories and models to the recent
advances that are relevant to pool fire dynamics have been integrated.
Basic theories with regard to vaporization of condensed fuel, the macro-
flame  morphology  and  structure  associated  with  air  entrainment  and
turbulence, radiative models and their properties  for pool fires under
normal ambient and stationary conditions were reviewed systematically
on the basis of their fundamental aspects. This state-of-the-art research
placed emphasis on the effects of a variety of boundary conditions on the
pool  fire  burning  behavior  through  experimental  approaches  and
considered extensive new developments in combustion and fire science.

Important developments relative to several of the boundary condition
effects, e.g., forced crossflow (wind), pressure and gravity, the oxygen
concentration,  confined  spaces  (e.g.,  flame  near  walls/corners,  and
multiple  pool  fires)  and  adjacent  diffusion  flames  on  the  pool  fire
burning behavior were clarified in detail based on the physical regime.
Wind, pressure, gravity, confined space or neighboring pool fires could
change  the  ambient  conditions  and  thus  the  air  entrainment  path
significantly, which would result in changes in the flame morphology
characteristics,  the  soot  formation  and  oxidation  processes,  and  the
attendant radiative heat flux to the condensed fuel surface. Ultimately,
the burning rates are influenced by the heat transfer process and then
react with other dynamic behaviors within a feedback loop.

In  addition,  several  new  theories  and  findings  were  summarized
systematically  in  comparison  with  the  conventional  knowledge  about
pool fire burning behavior. Examples include a flame height derivation
based on the turbulent mixing process rather than the air entrainment
concept, the onset and transition of the pool fire pulsation characteris-
tics,  the  generation  mechanism  of  the  streak-like  coherent  structures
that  appear  in  the  upstream  region  of  a  boundary-layer  flame,  deter-
mination  of  the  critical  pool  size  for  an  optically-thick  pool  fire  via
spectral characterizations, and a model of multi-point far-field radiation
to  an  external  target  using  the  hierarchical  homogeneous  gray  flame
volume and emissivity. These all deepen the understanding of the pool
fire  dynamics.  Despite  all  these  developments  and  progress,  a  great
effort will still be required to gain a full understanding of the mecha-
nisms that control pool fires and to predict the combustion behavior of
these fires because several challenges must be addressed.

(1) The first challenge relates to the sheer scale of pool fire plume
behavior prediction: form the meter scale to the kilometer scale. Most
experiments were conducted were on a reduced-scale as an expedience
to obtain general results by using scale modelling or applying the laws of
scaling. However, many aspects of these fires cannot be scaled because
of several interrelated factors. The air and fuel diffusion near the pool
base and the turbulent buoyancy-induced air flow above that need to be
addressed and quantified for large-scale pool fire, and the temporally
and spatially resolved local temperature and velocity fields should be
measured systematically. Pyrolysis of the fuel vapor core above the fuel
surface would change the radiative heat flux considerably via absorption
and reflection processes that would inhibit the effective emissive power;
this phenomenon is called radiative energy blockage. The heat loss from
a  large-scale  pool  fire  plume  is  governed  by  the  complex  effects  of
sooting on the flame radiated energy, which does not scale with the pool
size.  Large-scale  vortical  structures  and  small-scale  turbulence  are
coupled in non-linear manner with the radiation. In addition, obscura-
tion by black smoke around the flame envelope causes the radiative loss
to change spatio-temporally. Pulses of energy from the luminous flame
region  occurs  intermittently  when  the  fuels  come  into  reaction  with
entrained air. Under gusts of wind in outdoor conditions, the interplay
among  these  factors  will  lead  to  more  complicated  fire  technology.
Therefore, a great deal remains to be done experimentally by using a
wide range of fuels and more large-scale pool fire tests to validate the
classical  air  entrainment  model  and  the  flame  height  theory  and  to
explore how the fully-developed turbulent motion affects the pool fire
combustion behavior. To ensure good assessment of the large-scale pool
fire combustion process, any potential new findings and advances on the
air entrainment model involving turbulence intensity and the dissipa-
tion rate will be most welcome.

(2) Soot nucleation, agglomeration, oxidation, and the pool fire ra-
diation properties have gained significant attention in recent decades.
However, to date, a variety of boundary conditions involving the effects
of wind, pressure, gravity, oxygen concentration and external radiation
on soot production, flame radiation and the burning rate have mostly
been  limited  to  physical  aspects.  The  chemical  effects  caused  by  the
different  boundary  conditions  should  also  be  uncovered  by  extensive
experimental measurements of the OH, polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bon (PAH) species and of the soot production process using by planer

laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and laser induced incandescence (LII)
techniques, along with associated numerical simulations. To date, the
vast majority of research has focused on the mathematical relationship
between the radiation characteristic parameters under these boundary
conditions. However, new flame radiation models that can couple the
physicochemical effects must be addressed and established, especially
when fuel propensities must be taken into consideration as a result of the
emergence of biomass fuels. In addition, under low pressure and cross-
wind  effects,  spectrally-resolved  radiation  measurements  of  the  gases
and the soot in the flames of large-scale pool fires should be performed
to access the spatially distributed profiles, to re-ascertain the limits for
the gray, non-gray, homogeneous and non-homogeneous assumptions,
and to improve the theoretical and numerical models.

Furthermore, almost all the burning for turbulent diffusion flames
occurs  on  the  Kolmogorov  scale,  which  is  related  to  the  molecular
dissipation of turbulent fluctuations. This smallest scale in both turbu-
lent flow and the flame stretch rate is controlled collectively by the local
fluid laminar viscosity, the dissipation rate, and the Schmidt number.
Under various boundary conditions, the turbulence characteristic length
scale and the turbulence intensity may be altered to some extent, which
would cause the measurement and determination of the soot emission
and the radiative emanation to be a major challenge. Therefore, the need
for progress now requires that these multi-scale nature that is associated
with  turbulence  and  radiation  that  depends  on  both  physical  and
chemical aspects should be resolved carefully. It will also be necessary to
refine the physical and geometrical radiation models further for appli-
cation to specific targets under various circumstances by accounting for
the temperature and emissivity variations along both the radial and axial
directions  and  the actual  complex  3-D geometrical  flame  shapes  over
time.

(3) Last but not least, the flame structure, the fluid mechanics and the
instantaneous  characteristics  of  pool  fires  still  need  to  be  explored.
However, the relatively low velocity and the presence of soot acting as
natural  trace  particles  makes  it  possible  to  visualize  the  turbulent
structure of a pool fire. For example, the flow properties could be semi-
quantified by observing the flame pulsation process using photography.
Because both the spatial and temporal gradients are very steep and the
scales  must  be  relatively  large  to  enable  the  formation  of  a  fully-
turbulent  pool  fire,  it  is  very  challenging  to  capture  the  fluid  details
when the cost and the difficulty of measuring the velocity of a large-scale
pool fire are considered. In addition, reports of pool fire flow visuali-
zations in still air or under windy conditions, particularly for large-scale
fires, remain scarce to date. Therefore, two-dimensional velocity mea-
surement  techniques  including  LDV  and  PIV  or  some  other  improved
apparatus that can surround the pool fire and measure it with high fi-
delity should be provided to enable further understanding of the pool
fire fluid mechanics. This will be also helpful in enabling identification
of  the  vortex  core  from  the  velocity  vector  fields  to  promote  under-
standing  for  the  turbulent  nature  of  the  puffing  process,  the  air
entrainment model, and other related pool fire dynamics. To date, there
has also been a dearth of studies on major species distributions (i.e., CO2,
O2,  CO,  H2O),  with  the  simultaneous  temperature  measurements  at
various local position in canonical pool fire plumes. It will be particu-
larly  important  to  measure  and  collect  these  data  sets  for  the  fire
research  community  to  validate  their  pool  fire  numerical  simulation
models. The measurement equipment available at present more or less
has limitations,  particularly for quantification of the flow field of the
luminous part of the flame. To ease this task, the fire research commu-
nity should push for the development of new and improved instruments
that  can  measure  the  flame’s  internal  flow  field  directly,  even  with
relatively bright light. Full awareness of the aforementioned challenges
is  expected  to  form  the  next  development  step.  Provision  of  more
convenient  measurement  approaches  and  newly  advanced  techniques
would be welcomed for fire engineering applications.

Note  that  numerical  simulations  have  already  drawn  extensive
attention and have become the main development trends in recent years.

We hope that the scientific efforts for the experimental aspects, partic-
ularly for large-scale pool fires, will serve as a benchmark for perfor-
mance  evaluation  of  fires  simulation  models,  including  the  gas-phase
subgroup and the condensed-phase subgroup based upon computational
fluid dynamics tools.
